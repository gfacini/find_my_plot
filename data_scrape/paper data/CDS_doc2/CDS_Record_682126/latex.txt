**Impact of shortening the End Cap Toroid on the muon momentum resolution**

**----------------**

**1. The issue**

**----------------**

**It has been suggested, because of the lack of space between the back of the end-cap calorimeter and the front of the End Cap Toroid (ECT), to shorten the latter, on the IP side, by a few ten cm.**

**This note compares the field integrals for three toroid configurations:**

**- the standard one, hereafter labelled "TP", as described in the magnet section of the ATLAS Technical Proposal.**

**The average positions of the muon chambers are those of the TP, as communicated by JW on 27 Jan 95.**

**- a configuration with the ECT shortened by 20 cm on the IP side ("TP-20");**

**the EI chamber is moved outwards by 20 cm.**

**- a configuration with the ECT shortened by 50 cm on the IP side ("TP-50");**

**the EI chamber is moved outwards by 50 cm.**

**To this effect, three field maps were generated with the corresponding geometries (Tables 1-3), and the field integral between muon chambers evaluated as a function of eta and phi. The relative variation of the resolution, in the forward direction, due to the displacement of the EI chamber (independently of the change in IBdl), is taken into account using a geometrical scale factor. Multiple scattering and energy loss effects are neglected; their impact on the estimates of changes in resolution, quoted below, should however be minor.**

**2. Results**

**----------------**

**The main results are summarized in the figures below. In what follows, the symbol IBdl refers to the field integral of the toroidal component of the field, between muon chambers; the symbol IBrdl is the non-toroidal component normal to the muon direction.**

**near the ECT coil plane is clearly visible, as well as an overall reduction at large rapidities.**Ratio of IBdl, for two different configurations, vs eta, for the first 4 angular regions of Fig. 5a. Dashed: IBdl(TP-20) / IBdl(TP). Dotted: IBdl(TP-50) / IBdl(TP). After rapid variations of the ratio in the transition region, the bending power at large rapidities stabilizes at 95 % of the TP value (resp. 88 %) for TP-20 (resp. TP-50). The reduction is consistent with the fractional decrease in length of the ECT. Note, however, a very significant degradation in an extended part of the transition region for the TP-50 case.

If one requires a minimum IBdl of 2 Tm to perform a momentum measurement, then the single muon coverage loss is - 1%, - 1.3%, and - 2.4% for, respectively, the TP, TP-20 and TP-50 configurations. The latter corresponds to a loss of usable Higgs events from this source alone of 10 %.

3. Conclusions -------------------------------------------------  Configuration TP TP-20 TP-50 Single muon cov. loss (< 2 Tm) 1.3 2.4 (%) H-> 4 mu rate loss 4 5.2 10 (%) Avrg IBdl reduction, eta > 1.6 - 5 l2 (%, norm. to TP) Avrg loss of resolution  if IBdl were fixed (EI-EM lvr arm) 1.8 4.8 (%, norm. to TP)  including IBdl degradation - 6.7 16.0

In summary, shortening the ECT by 20 cm has a moderate effect on the forward resolution, but a significant one on the effective magnetic acceptance; shortening it by 50 cm represents, in our opinion, an unacceptable degradation of the ATLAS performance. It should also be stressed that what matters in the end is not the impact of the individual downsizing of subsystem performance, but the combined effect of all the changes currently under consideration, which will be discussed at an upcoming toroid meeting.
