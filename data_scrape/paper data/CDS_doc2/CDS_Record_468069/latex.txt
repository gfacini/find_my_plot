###### Abstract

We report a study on the measurement of the SUSY breaking scale \(\frac{\rm P}{\rm F}\) in the framework of gauge-mediated supersymmetry breaking (GMSB) models at the LHC. The work is focused on the GMSB scenario where a stau is the next-to-lightest SUSY particle (NLSP) and decays into a gravitino with lifetime \(c_{\rm NLSP}\) in the range 0.5 m to 1 km. We study the identification of long-lived sleptons using the momentum and time of light measurements in the muon chambers of the ATLAS experiment. A realistic evaluation of the statistical and systematic uncertainties on the measurement of the slepton mass and lifetime is performed, based on a detailed simulation of the detector response. A possible range and precision on \(\frac{\rm P}{\rm F}\) achievable with a counting method are assessed. Many features of our analysis can be extended to the study of different theoretical frameworks with similar signatures at the LHC.

Neutralino NLSP scenario: Occurs whenever \(m_{{}_{N_{1}}}<(m_{{}_{\gamma}}m)\). Here typically a decay \(N_{1}\uparrow G\) is the final step of decay chains following any SUSY production process. As a consequence, the main inclusive signature at colliders is prompt or displaced photon pairs + X + missing energy, depending on the \(N_{1}\) lifetime. \(N_{1}\uparrow GZ^{\circ}\) and other minor channels may also be relevant at TeV colliders.

Stau NLSP scenario: Realised \(\tilde{m}_{{}_{1}}<\tilde{m}_{{}_{N}},m_{{}_{1}}\), features \(\tilde{\gamma}_{1}\uparrow G\) decays, producing pairs (if \(\tilde{\gamma}_{1}\) decays promptly) or charged semistable \(\tilde{\gamma}_{1}\) tracks or decay kinks + X + missing energy (for larger \(\tilde{\gamma}_{1}\) lifetimes). Here'stands for e or.

Slepton co-NLSP scenario: When \(m_{{}_{N}}<\tilde{m}_{{}_{N}},m_{{}_{1}}+m\), \(\tilde{\gamma}_{1}\uparrow G\) decays are also open with large BR, since \(\tilde{\gamma}_{1}\uparrow\tilde{\gamma}_{1}\) decays are kinematically forbidden. In addition to the signatures of the stau NLSP scenario, one also gets "'pairs or'tracks or decay kinks.

Neutralino-stau co-NLSP scenario: If \(m_{{}_{N}}\), \(\tilde{\gamma}_{1}<m\) and \(m_{{}_{N_{1}}}<m_{{}_{N}}\), both signatures of the neutralino NLSP and stau NLSP scenario are present at the same time, since \(N_{1}\not\sim\gamma_{1}\) decays are not allowed by phase space.

Note that in the GMSB parameters space \(m_{{}_{N}}>m_{{}_{N}}\) always. Also, one should keep in mind that the classi cation above is an indicative scheme valid in the limit \(m_{{}_{e}}\), \(m\uparrow 0\), neglecting also those cases where a net-tuned choice of \(\overline{F}\) and the sparticle mass may give rise to competition between phase-space suppressed decay channels from one ordinary sparticle to another and sparticle decays to the gravitino [10].

The fundamental scale of SUSY breaking \(\overline{F}\) is a crucial parameter for the phenomenology of a SUSY theory. In the SUGRA framework, the gravitino mass sets the scale of the soft SUSY breaking masses (\(\sqrt{s}\), \(101\) TeV), so that \(\overline{F}\) is typically as large as \(10^{6}\)\({}^{11}\) GeV [cf. Eq. (2)]. As a consequence, the interactions of the \(G\) with the other MSSM particles (\(F^{{}^{\prime}}\)) are too weak to be of relevance in collider physics and there is no direct way to access \(\overline{F}\) experimentally. In GMSB theories the situation is di erent. The soft SUSY breaking scale of the MSSM and the sparticle masses are set by gauge interactions between the messenger and the low energy sectors to be \(\sqrt{s}\)[cf. Eq. (4), next section], so that typical values are \(10\)\(100\) TeV. On the other hand, \(\overline{F}\) is only subject to a lower bound [cf. Eq. (5), next section], for which values well below \(10^{10}\) GeV and even as low as several tens of TeV are reasonable. \(G\) is in this case the LSP, and its interactions are strong enough to allow NLSP decays into \(G_{\rm p}\) inside the typical detector size. The latter circumstance states us a chance for extracting \(\overline{F}\) experimentally through a measurement of the NLSP mass and lifetime, according to Eq. (3).

Furthermore, the possibility of determining \(\overline{F}\) with good precision opens a window on the physics of the SUSY breaking sector (the so-called "sechuded" sector) and the way this SUSY breaking is transmitted to the messenger sector. Indeed, the characteristic scale of SUSY breaking felt by the messengers (and hence by the MSSM sector) given by \(\overline{F_{\rm mess}}\) in Eq. (5), next section, can be also determined once the MSSM spectrum is known. By comparing the measured values of \(\overline{F}\) and \(\overline{F_{\rm mess}}\) in might well be possible to get information on the way the excluded and messenger sector communicate to each other. For instance, if it turns out that \(\overline{F_{\rm mess}}\) is \(\overline{F}\), then it is very likely that the communication occurs radiatively and the ratio \(\overline{F_{\rm mess}}\) is given by some loop factor. On the contrary, if the communication occurs via a direct interaction, this ratio is just given by a Yukawa-type coupling constant, with values \(<1\), see Refs. [4, 7].

on the NLSP momentum distribution is provided by the squark mass scalar \(m_{q}\) only (in the stau NLSP scenario or slepton co-NLSP scenarios of GM SB, one generally \(ndsm_{q}>m_{q}\)). To perform detailed simulations, we select a representative set of GM SB models generated by SUSYFIRE. We limit ourselves to models with \(m_{\rm NLSP}>100\) GeV, motivated by the discussion in Sec. 2, and \(m_{q}<2\) TeV, in order to yield an adequate event statistics after a three-year low-luminosity run (corresponding to 30 fb\({}^{-1}\)) at the LHC. Within these ranges, we choose eight points (four in the stau NLSP scenario and four in the slepton co-NLSP scenario), most of which representing extreme cases allowed by GM SB in the (m\({}_{\rm NLSP},m_{q}\)) plane in order to cover the various possibilities.

In Tab. 1, we list the input GM SB parameters we used to generate these eight points, while in Tab. 2 we report the corresponding values of the stau mass, the average squark mass \(m_{q}\) and the gluino mass. The NLSP " column indicates whether the model belongs to the stau NLSP or slepton co-NLSP scenario. The last column gives the total cross section in pb for producing any pairs of SUSY particles at the LHC.

The scatter plots in Fig. 1 show our eight exempl points, together with all the relevant GM SB models we generated, in the (m\({}_{\rm NLSP},m_{q}\)) plane. In particular, all models where the charged tracks come from semistable \(\gamma\)'s only (i.e., stau NLSP or neutralino-stau co-NLSP scenarios) are displayed in Fig. 1a, which models in the slepton co-NLSP scenario are shown in Fig. 1b.

For each sample model point, the events were generated with the ISAJET Monte Carlo [13] that incorporates the calculation of the SUSY mass spectrum and branching fraction using the GM SB parameters as input. We have checked that for the eight model points

considered the particle masses calculated with ISAJET are in good agreement with the output of SUSYFIRE. The generated events were then passed through ATLFAST [14], a fast particle-level simulation of the ATLAS detector. The ATLFAST package, was only used to evaluate the efficiency of the calorimetric trigger that selects the GMSB events and of the event selection cuts. The detailed response of the detector to the skeleton NLSP has been parametrised for this work using the results of a full simulation study, as described in the next section.

## 4 Slepton Detection

The experimental signatures of heavy long-lived charged particles have been discussed both in the framework of GMSB and in more general scenarios [15, 17]. The two main observables which can be used to separate these particles from muons are the high specific ionisation and the time of light in the detector.

We concentrate here on the measurement of the time of light which is made possible by the timing precision (\(<1\) ns) and by the size of the ATLAS muon spectrometer. In the barrel part of the detector (j j\(<1\)) the precision muon system consists of three multilayers of precision drift tubes immersed in a toroidal air-core magnetic field. The three measuring stations are located at distances of approximately 5, 7.5 and 10 meters from the interaction point. A particle crossing a drift chamber finishes the chamber gas along its path, and the electrons produced by the ionisation drift to the anode wire under the influence of an electric field. The particle position is calculated from the measurement of the drift time of the ionisation electrons to the anode wire. In order to perform this calculation a starting time \(t_{0}\) for counting the drift time is needed, corresponding to the

the muon trigger chambers. The first option requires a detailed study of the matching procedure between detectors. This study was performed for muons in [11], but the results can not be transferred automatically to the case of heavy particles for which the \(e\) ect of multiple scattering in traversing the calorimetric system is much more severe.

In the case of the trigger chambers, as already discussed above, a limited time window around the beam crossing is read out, restricting the range for which the momentum can be measured. We therefore evaluated the statistical precision achievable for the eight exempl models in two different intervals: \(0.6<~{}<0.91\) and \(0.8<~{}<0.91\). For this measurement the sleptons are assumed to be stable.

From the measurements of the slepton momentum, and of the particle, the mass can be measured using the standard relation \(m=p_{\frac{1}{2}}^{-2}\). For each value of  and momentum, the measurement error is known, and it is given by the parametrisations in Ref. [20]. Therefore, the most straightforward way to measure the mass is just to use the weighted average of all the masses calculated with the above formula. For two of the example points, we show in Fig. 4 the distribution of the measured mass as a function of. For values of  in the range (\(0.6\),\(0.9\)) the spread in the mass measurement goes from 5% to 15%, rising with [20]. If enough statistics at low  is available, the measurement precision will be dominated by the events with a value below \(0.8\).

In Tab. 4, we show the numbers of the NLSP candidates for an integrated luminosity of 30 fb \({}^{-1}\) and the expected errors on the mass measurement. On the statistical errors are shown. The main systematic error on this measurement will be the uncertainty on the NLSP momentum scale, as the systematic error on the time measurement is already included in the parametrisation. We expect this uncertainty to be of order 0.1% as for the muons, if the accuracy of the energy scale measurement can be propagated to the high momentum scale considered in this analysis.

From the numbers in the table, one expects that if the NLSP is long lived, the measurement error on the NLSP mass will be dominated by the systematic error for models with a squark mass scale up to 1 TeV.

In conclusion, the slepton mass can be measured with a precision of a few permille for all the considered models with an integrated luminosity of 30 pb \({}^{-1}\).

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:15]

The surviving background of high momentum muons can be statistically subtracted and it will be discussed in the following section.

The ratio:

\[R=\frac{N_{2}}{N_{1}}\]

is a function of the slepton lifetime. Its dependence on the NLSP lifetime c in metres is shown in Fig. 5 for four of the eight model points. The curves for the model points not shown are either very similar to one of the curves we show or lie between the external curves corresponding to models 1 and 8, thus providing no additional information. Note that the curve for model 6 starts from \(c=25\) m and not from \(c=50\) m, as for the other models. This is due to the large value of \(M_{\rm\,m\,mes}\) (cfr. Tab. 1), determining a minimum NLSP lifetime allowed by theory which is macroscopic in this case (cfr. Eqs. (3) and (5)).

The probability \(P\) for a particle of mass \(m\) and momentum \(p\) and proper lifetime \(c\) to travel a distance \(L\) before decaying is given by the expression:

\[P(L)=e^{m\,L=pc}\]

The value of \(N_{2}\) is therefore a function of the momentum distribution of the slepton, which is determined by the details of the SUSY spectrum. One needs therefore to simulate the full SUSY cascade decays in order to construct the \(c\) - R relationship.

The statistical error in the R measurement, can be evaluated as

\[(R)=\frac{S}{R(1\,R)}{N_{1}}\]

Figure 5: The ratio \(R=N_{2}\)=\(N_{1}\) defined in the text as a function of the slepton lifetime c. Only the curves corresponding to the model points 1, 5, 6, 8 are shown.

Relevant for the precision with which the SUSY breaking scale can be measured is the error on the measured \(c\), which can be extracted from the curves shown in Fig. 5. This error can be evaluated as:

\[(c)=\frac{\overline{\left(R\right)}\overline{\left(c\right)}}{\overline{\left(c \right)}}\]

The measurement precision calculated according to this formula is shown in Figs. 6 and 7 for the eight example points, always for an integrated luminosity of 30 fb \({}^{1}\).

The full line in the plots is the error on \(c\), which the statistical error on \(R\) is considered. The available statistics is a function of them as scale of the strongly interacting particles. For mass scales between 500 and 1200 GeV, a statistical error smaller than 10% can be achieved for \(c\) values ranging between 1 m and several hundreds of metres. For a mass scale of 2000 GeV the statistical error is typically 10-20%. In the ideal case the details of the SUSY model are known and the \(R\), relationship can be built from Monte Carlo, including the effect of the detector acceptance. The subtraction of the background muons from the SUSY events is the dominant contribution to the systematic error on the \(N_{2}\) measurement in this ideal case, and will be treated in detail in the next section.

An additional uncertainty comes from the evaluation of the losses in \(N_{2}\) because of sleptons produced outside of the acceptance, or absorbed in the calorimeters, or which escape the calorimeter with a transverse momentum below the cuts. This contribution is however expected to be much more important for the realistic case in which an imperfect knowledge of the SUSY model is assumed, and will be studied in that framework in a later section. Since the uncertainty on \(R\) is a consequence of the uncertainty on the evaluation of \(N_{2}\), at this level we parametrize the systematic error on \(R\) as a term proportional to \(R\) which is quadratically added to the statistical error. We choose two values, 1% R and 5% R, and we propagate the error to the \(c\)  measurement. The results are given as the dashed and the dotted lines in the plots in Figs. 6 and 7. For squark mass scales up to 1200 GeV, assuming a 1% systematic error on the measured ratio, a precision better than 10% on the \(c\)  measurement can be obtained for lifetime values between 0.5-1 m and 50-80 m. If the systematic uncertainty grows to 5%, a 10% precision can only be achieved in the range 1-10 m. If the mass scale goes up to 2 TeV, already at the level of pure statistical error a 10% precision is not achievable. One can however achieve a 20% precision over \(c\) ranges between 5 and 100 m, if a 1% systematic error is assumed.

### Muon Background from SUSY Events

The definition of \(N_{2}\), as described in the previous section, relies on a very loose identification of the second slepton candidate in order to minimise acceptance corrections, which are the dominant source of systematic uncertainties on the \(N_{2}\)=\(N_{1}\) ratio.

In the models considered for this study the charged sleptons are light, and are mostly produced in the cascade decays of charginos and neutralinos through decays of the type \(\sim^{0}\), \(\sim^{0}\), and \(\sim^{1}\). Therefore in a significant fraction of the SUSY events muons will be produced together with the sleptons. As can be seen from the second and third column of Tab. 5, at least one muon is produced in 60-80% of the events for all considered models, and more than one muon in 30-40% of the cases for most models.

Most of these muons are soft, in particular in the case of \(\sim_{1}\) NLSP, and are rejected by the requirement in the (P\({}_{\rm{meas}}\), \({}_{\rm{meas}}\)) plane which roughly corresponds to requiring the momentum of the candidate to be above twice the slepton mass. The number of muons per events after this cut are given in columns four and we of Tab. 5. The background after cuts is a function of the mass difference between the squarks and the NLSP, which

determines the lepton momentum spectrum, and of the NLSP mass which determines the minimum required momentum for a candidate. The fraction ranges between a few percent and 20% of the events.

The background muons can be statistically subtracted using the observed distribution of the slepton candidates. For a background momentum \(P\) of the candidate the \(P\) of the sleptons is peaked at the value \(=P=P^{2}+m^{2}\) where \(m\) is the slepton mass, whereas the distribution for the muons is peaked at \(=1\) and is essentially independent of the muon momentum. As an illustration we show in Fig. 8 the distribution of sleptons (full line histogram ) and of background muons (hatched histogram ) form model point 4, which has a high background contribution. The histogram \(\mathrm{Im}\) fits are set to exclude the peak at \(=1\) to enhance the readability. The distributions are given for four momentum bins, from 250 to 600 GeV, and the clear difference in shape between signal and background can be observed. The shape of the measured distribution for a given momentum only depends on the mass of the particle, and will be known for both signal and background both from detailed simulation of the detector response and from the data themselves. It will therefore be possible to measure bin by bin the relative contribution of signal and background with a likelihood to the observed distributions. The signal/background separation obtained with this technique will be further validated by comparing the momentum spectrum of the background from isolated muons with the corresponding spectrum for electrons in SUSY events.

Given the good control of the detector response expected in ATLAS and the multiple experimental handles available, the dominant contribution to the uncertainty on the measurement of \(R\) from this source will be the statistical error on the background evaluation. This error will have a value of approximately \(\mathrm{\SIUnitSymbolMicro k=N}_{1}\), where \(k\) is the number in the fourth column of Table 5. The contribution of this factor to the total error is only significant for the model points 3, 4, 5 and 8. The main effect is a 30-40% degradation of the statistical error for \(\mathrm{\SIUnitSymbolMicro k=N}_{2}\) for Models 3 and 8. In all other cases, the effect on the uncertainty from this source is smaller than the curves labelled \(\mathrm{\SIUnitSymbolMicro k=N}_{1}\) in Figs. 6 and 7.

### Model Independent Lifetime Measurement

Once the muon background has been subtracted, if the underlying SUSY model is known, \(\mathrm{\SIUnitSymbolMicro k=N}_{2}\) can simply be measured from \(R\) and the curves shown in Fig. 5. Most of the SUSY mass spectrum will be measured from explicit reconstruction of exclusive decay chains, as shown in [21] and [11]. It is difficult however at this stage to evaluate the uncertainty in the construction of the \(R\)-calibration curve from an imperfect knowledge of the SUSY model. As an alternative approach, the measurement can be performed by deconvoluting the \(\mathrm{\SIUnitSymbolMicro k=N}_{1}\) of the \(\mathrm{\SIUnitSymbolMicro k=N}_{2}\) of the \(\mathrm{\SIUnitSymbolMicro k=N}_{3}\) of the \(\mathrm{\SIUnitSymbolMicro k=N}_{4}\) of the \(\mathrm{\SIUnitSymbolMicro k=N}_{5}\) of the \(\mathrm{\SIUnitSymbolMicro k=N}_{6}\) of the \(\mathrm{\SIUnitSymbolMicro k=N}_{7}\) of the \(\mathrm{\SIUnitSymbolMicro k=N}_{8}\) of the \(\mathrm{\SIUnitSymbolMicro k=N}_{9}\) of the \(\mathrm{\SIUnitSymbolMicro k=N}_{1}\) of the

Ambasanio, Mele, Petrana, Polesello, Rimotti / Measuring the SUSY Breaking...

Figure 11: Fractional-error on the measurement of the SUSY breaking scale \(\overline{\rm P}\overline{\rm F}\) formed points 1 to 4. We assume an integrated luminosity of 30 fb\({}^{-1}\). The curves are shown for the three different assumptions on the fractional systematic error used in Figs. 6 and 7.

generalone can explore a range of higher \(\overline{\rm P}\) values with a small relative error, essentially due to the large NLSP mass in these models. Note also that the theoretical lower limit (5) on \(\overline{\rm F}\) is equal to about \(1200,1500,3900,8900\) TeV respectively in model points 2, 5, 6, 7, while it stays well below 1000 TeV for the other models.

## 10 Conclusions

We have discussed a simple method to measure at the LHC with the ATLAS detector the fundamental SUSY breaking scale \(\overline{\rm F}\) in the G MSB scenarios where a slight \(\rm S\)- NLSP and decays to the gravitino with a lifetime in the range \(0.5\,m<c_{\rm NLSP}<1\) km. This method requires the measurement of the time of light of long lived sleptons and is based on counting events with one or two identified NLSP's. The achievable measurement precision critically depends on the uncertainties in evaluating the experimental ineencies in the NLSP detection. We have performed a particle level simulations for eight representative G MSB models, same of them being particularly hard due to low statistics. The experimental study is based on a parametrisation of the ATLAS muon detector response to sleptons, based on a detailed full simulation study. The careful consideration of the possible sources of uncertainty allows us to conclude that the systematic uncertainty a acting the measurement will be at the percent level. In this framework, a level of precision of a few 10's % on the SUSY breaking scale measurement can be achieved in significant parts of the \(1000<\overline{\rm F}<30000\) TeV range, for all models considered. The range of the measurement could be extended through the direct detection of NLSP decays either inside the inner detector cavity or inside the muon spectrometer. A detailed detector simulation for these signatures would be needed in order to assess the possible gain in sensitivity.

We stress that the results of the present analysis cover larger classes of theoretical frameworks. In particular, any model in lying the presence of long-lived particles decaying into leptonic final states through the production of primary heavy particles with mass of order 1 TeV (parameter that guarantees a crucial suppression of the SM background) can be analysed according to similar strategies.
