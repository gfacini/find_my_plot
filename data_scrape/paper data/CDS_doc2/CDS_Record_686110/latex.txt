**Abstract**

A new technique is proposed for producing anode wire supports in long drift tubes. This technique could be particularly useful in the construction of the pressurized drift tubes used in ATLAS for the precision measurement of muons. In single tube production the technique can fix the position of the wire with respect to the outside of the tube to better than the required 10 \(\upmu\) accuracy. The technique can also simultaneously fix all of the wires in a chamber to the support points in a pattern identical to the ends.

**Introduction**

The anode wire in a long drift tube sags under gravity and is further displaced by the electrostatic forces on the wire segments that are not located at the center of the tube. Wire supports at regular intervals within the tube would reduce the effects of these distortions and allow tubes of any reasonable length and diameter to be constructed.

In ATLAS the tolerance on the wire placement within a tube is about 10 \(\upmu\) so that after stacking the tubes the wire placement is known to 20 \(\upmu\) (r.m.s.). To maintain this accuracy in the presence of electrostatic forces the distance from the inner wall of the tube to the wire must be known to better than 100 \(\upmu\) along its full length; a tolerance much less stringent than on the wire placement. To accomplish these requirements internal wire supports were proposed to reduce these deviations in the Monitored Drift Tube (MDT) chambers for ATLAS. Difficulties in perfecting this option led to the alternative, presented in the Technical Proposal[1], that allows the tubes to sag by the same amount as the wires thus reducing the number of supports needed to at least one in chambers with tube lengths greater than 3 m. We note, however, that about half the tubes in ATLAS will require at least one internal support.

In the baseline assembly procedure all tubes with an internal support require strict tolerances on the tube dimensions to reach the 10 \(\upmu\) wire placement accuracy. Also, the procedure requires a precise support that captures the anode wire to be inserted into the tube by a specialized machine. We present here a simple technique for creating anode wire supports in long drift tubes that is very different from the existing procedures but achieves the required placement accuracy and relieves some of the requirements on the tube manufacturing. Also, multiple supports can be realized with the same techniques allowing the use of smaller diameter tubes (<3 cm) in even the longest ATLAS chambers should drift time and occupancy considerations require them.

The materials used in the solution proposed here are not new. In the construction of open wire plane detectors, such as in a PWC, various techniques have been used to fix the anode wires in positions accurately determined by an external comb. This technique has already been proposed for fixing the wires at the ends of the MDT tubes[2]. Any material like solder that makes a phase change from liquid to solid can be used for this purpose.

However, very careful soldering techniques are required to insure that the wire does not move during the rapid phase change from liquid to solid. Special solders must be also be used to avoid the amalgamation of the wire's gold plating into the solder that can allow the wire to loose tension. Glues also make this phase change, usually more slowly than solder, and can be relied upon to not affect the location of the wires. If a wire is disturbed during the application of the glue it returns to its original position by the action of the restoring forces on a wire under tension. If the restoring forces are large, as is the case near one of the combs, the wire moves rapidly through the glue, but more slowly if the restoring forces are small as is the case far from a comb. If the glue has a low viscosity the wire returns to its nominal position very quickly in most situations.

In long drift tubes fixing the wires at support points with glue (or other material with a phase change from liquid to solid) is made difficult by the inaccessible location of the supports. We have invented a number of techniques, one described in a later section, that would allow the gluing of anode wires at support points inside of long drift tubes. Before we describe them, however, we discuss the capabilities that such techniques would enable.

## Capabilities of Adaptive Wire Supports

Single Tube Construction

In the first application of adaptive wire supports we discuss the assembly of a single tube. The anode wire is threaded through a 1 mm diameter hole in the center of a thin disk-shaped wire support located at the midpoint of the tube. The disk (interference fit, spring loaded or crimped) is securely positioned in the tube and also serves to stiffen the tube's circular cross section. Since the hole diameter is large many techniques such as those that use a stiff leader can be used to thread the wire through the hole.

The anode wire is accurately located in the ends of the tube by a plug that positions the wire precisely at its center. The tube is rotated vertically to insure that the wire hangs straight and placed against a jig containing three small jig blocks located at the two ends and at the middle of the tube as shown in Fig. 1.

The jig blocks have a cutout whose shape depends on the specific multilayer assembly scheme chosen[3]. For semicircular cutouts (or fraction thereof) the diameter of the cutout matches the diameter of the plugs at the ends and the outside diameter of the tube at the middle. The centers of the jig block cutouts are positioned precisely along the jig centerline, therefore, they must also coincide with the wire. The wire, being free to move in the 1 mm hole, must pass through the center of the tube cross section at the support.

The glue is then injected into the support hole and allowed to cure. In this way the wire is fixed at the center of a circular cross section of the tube at the support location and the plugs at the two ends.

We have verified that the wire is not moved from its nominal position by the injection or curing of the glue. These tests used 6m long wires threaded through a small hole in a thin plate located at the midpoint of the wire. The wire was viewed in two transverse directions by microscopes located near the hole and monitored during the gluing process. We have observed no movements of the wire from its nominal position before gluing to the level of 2\(\upmu\). Therefore, the uncertainty in the wire position relative to the outside of the tube will not be affected by the curing of the glue.

Once the glue has cured the tube can be removed from the jig and placed in any orientation. If the tube is realigned so that the center of the tube cross section at its midpoint lies on a line between the centers of the plugs then the wire support points must also lie on that line.

This procedure locates the wires to an outside reference to the required 10 \(\upmu\) tolerance while allowing the tolerances on the tube wall thickness, eccentricity, and straightness, to be relaxed yet satisfy the 100 \(\upmu\) requirement on the wire centering in the tube. Tubes with thin walls (250 \(\upmu\)) produced to only rough tolerances can be used that would minimize the intrinsic inefficiency, radiation length fraction, and weight without sacrificing accuracy.

Multilayer Construction

There is a significant construction simplification that this technique enables if the glue insertion is delayed until the tubes have been bonded into the chamber package as shown in Fig. 2.

Aligning the tubes during this bonding at the tube ends (10 \(\upmu\)) can be accomplished by several techniques that have already been developed but in this scheme the jigs _need only position the tubes between the plugs to the 100 \(\mu\) tolerance._ This tolerance can be easily achieved by constraining the tube package dimensions. Before the multilayer is removed from the jig three gauge blocks (reference flats) are bonded to the package at the center and two ends of the package. For convenience the guage blocks can be aligned to lie in a plane parallel to the desired wire planes and separated from them by a known distance. A reference marker is fixed on the surface of each block so that the three markers lie on a straight line. The chamber is then rotated so that the wires are vertical, the reference flats are realigned and glue is inserted into each support hole and allowed to cure.

In the future, if the three gauge blocks are positioned to lie in the same plane and the reference markers lie on a straight line then the wire support points will also be aligned in the same way relative to the tube ends as when they were glued, i.e., straight and parallel

and absolutely located relative to the reference flats.

These procedures can be extended to accommodate any number of support points along the length of the tube, any number of tube layers and, if desired, a support structure with or without an alignment system[4] installed. A single support in 4m long tubes and two supports in 6m long tubes would result in a 2m long free span of wire in each chamber.

If the entire assembly must take place in only the horizontal orientation (e.g., for space reasons) then before the glue has cured the tube package (or a single tube) must be displaced at the support point relative to the ends by an amount equal to the wire sag.

### Adaptive Support Techniques

As mentioned in the Introduction we have thought of many techniques for insertion of the glue into the hole or other phase changing procedures consistent with the assembly steps discussed in the previous section. We will describe here a few of the more promising techniques.

The technique accomplishes the remote injection of glue into the 1 mm hole using a support shown in Fig. 3. Prior to insertion in the tube the 1 \(\upmu\)l glue reservoir (cavity) in the support is filled with a glue and the wall of the 1 mm hole is painted with an activator that will start the curing process once the glue is injected into the hole. The glue reservoir is connected to the 1 mm hole and to a larger 10 \(\upmu\)l gas reservoir by narrow channels (tubes); surface tension preventing the glue from running out of its reservoir. If the pressure in the tube is reduced to 0.9 bar the gas will expand in its reservoir by about 10%, pushing the glue out of its reservoir through the narrow channel and into the 1 mm hole. The glue is then allowed to fully cure before the tube is re-pressurized.

Since atmospheric pressure is not constant a gas diffusion path into the gas reservoir is also provided that allows a slow gas leakage through its walls insuring that only a rapid decrease in the pressure will cause the glue to be injected into the hole. Methods that use over-pressure are also possible but may require a mechanical linkage to force the glue out of its reservoir. We plan on producing some simple prototypes to determine the proper glue and activator, channel and reservoir sizes/shapes to use. Our first tests of this procedure will use Acrylic glues and activators. These glues set in a few minutes once activated.

Another more intrusive technique requires a small hole to be made in the tube at the location of the support. This would allow glue to be injected into a channel in the support that leads to the 1 mm hole. A plug would then be glued into the hole to reseal the tube or it can be sealed with glue alone. This procedure would be appropriate for single tubes or for tube multilayers if the setup of the glue occurs after the layers are stacked for bonding.

The glue could be placed in the 1mm hole just prior to insertion if the glue does not set up quickly. In this technique the wire is threaded through another hole in the support disk and is tensioned there. A small slit connects this hole with the central 1mm hole allowing the wire to be moved into the glue when the tube is placed in the alignment jig.

## Conclusions

We have presented techniques that will allow a wire to be precisely fixed inside of a tube by gluing the wire to its support. There are many variations on this theme and other techniques may exist, however, we are confident that the ones presented here can be made to work reliably. The delayed gluing scheme presented here offers great flexibility in the assembly procedures. Given the advantages that these techniques would have over existing methods of long drift tube construction we recommend that their development be investigated fully.
