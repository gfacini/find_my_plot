# Prospects for the Measurement of the Top-Quark Mass

using the Template Method with early ATLAS Data

The ATLAS Collaboration

###### Abstract

The prospects are presented for a top-quark mass, \(m_{\mathrm{top}}\), measurement via the template method using the channel \(t\bar{t}\to\mathrm{lepton}+\mathrm{jets}\) based on early ATLAS data. Two variants of the template analysis are presented, a 1-dimensional template analysis for very early data with an integrated luminosity, \(\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{int}}\), of up to 100 pb\({}^{-1}\), and a 2-dimensional template analysis optimized for \(\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{int}}\) of up to 1 fb\({}^{-1}\), the luminosity expected from the upcoming 2010\(-\)2011 LHC run.

The 1-dimensional template analysis uses the stabilized top-quark mass, \(m_{\mathrm{top}}^{\mathrm{stab}}\), exploiting the event-by-event ratio of the reconstructed top-quark and \(W\) boson masses associated to the hadronically decaying top quark candidate. This variable is chosen to minimize the impact of the jet energy scale, JES, uncertainty on \(m_{\mathrm{top}}\). This is advantageous, since the JES is expected to be precisely known only after larger sets of ATLAS data have been collected. The 2-dimensional analysis uses \(b\)-tagging, as well as a kinematic fit of the decay products of both top-quarks, and simultaneously extracts \(m_{\mathrm{top}}\) and the JES from the data, thereby offering a more precise determination of \(m_{\mathrm{top}}\), while requiring a better understanding of the detector.

With the 1-d template method, and combining the \(t\bar{t}\to\mathrm{electron}+\mathrm{jets}\) and \(t\bar{t}\to\mathrm{muon}+\mathrm{jets}\) channels, a measurement of \(m_{\mathrm{top}}\) with a statistical precision of about 2.0 GeV and a systematic precision of about 3.8 GeV is expected for \(\sqrt{s}=10\) TeV and \(\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{int}}=100\) pb\({}^{-1}\). With the 2-d template method, and using 1 fb\({}^{-1}\) of data in the combined channel, the statistical precision is about 0.6 GeV and the systematic precision about 2.0 GeV.

Introduction

The top-quark mass is a fundamental parameter of the Standard Model, SM, of particle physics. Being roughly 40 times larger than the mass of its weak isospin partner, the \(b\)-quark, it gives large contributions to electroweak radiative corrections which, when connected to precision electroweak measurements, can be used to derive constraints on the masses of the yet-unobserved Higgs boson [1], and of particles predicted by some SM extensions. After the discovery of the top-quark in 1995, much work has been devoted to measure its mass precisely. The present world average value is \(m_{\rm top}=173.1\pm 1.3\) GeV [2].

The main path followed to determine \(m_{\rm top}\) at hadron colliders is measuring the invariant mass distribution of the three jets assigned to the decay products of the top-quark candidates, \(m_{\rm top}^{\rm reco}\), and deducing \(m_{\rm top}\) by using sophisticated analyses methods. The most precise measurement of this type is based on the \(t\bar{t}\to{\rm lepton+jets}\) channel with lepton \(=e,\mu\). Most analyses suffer from the fact that the experimental knowledge of the jet energy scale, JES, is limited, which results in possible shifts of \(m_{\rm top}^{\rm reco}\) with respect to \(m_{\rm top}\). Frequently, this source of uncertainty gives the largest contribution to the total systematic uncertainty. In addition, it is expected that for early ATLAS data taken at the LHC proton-proton collider the determination of the JES will be much less precise than for the published Tevatron results.

The aim of this paper is to explore the prospects for a determination of the top-quark mass with early ATLAS data in view of this difficulty. To do so two paths are explored, either aiming at being as independent of the JES as possible, or determining the JES together with \(m_{\rm top}\). Firstly, a 1-dimensional template analysis (1-d analysis) is performed using the stabilized top-quark mass, \(m_{\rm top}^{\rm stab}\) proposed in [3], to minimize the impact of the JES uncertainty on \(m_{\rm top}\), where \(m_{\rm top}^{\rm stab}\) is defined as:

\[m_{\rm top}^{\rm stab}\equiv\frac{m_{\rm top}^{\rm reco}}{m_{W}^{\rm reco}}\cdot m _{W}\,. \tag{1}\]

Here \(m_{\rm top}^{\rm reco}\) is the reconstructed invariant mass of the top-quark, \(m_{W}^{\rm reco}\) is the reconstructed invariant mass of the \(W\) boson, and \(m_{W}\) is the world average value of the \(W\) boson mass [4], which is merely used to bring \(m_{\rm top}^{\rm stab}\) numerically close to the top-quark mass. Secondly, a 2-dimensional analysis (2-d analysis) is conducted, which uses \(b\)-tagging, as well as a kinematic fit of the decay products of both top-quarks, and an explicit correction for the difference in jet energy scale between \(b\)-jets and light jets. The 2-d analysis simultaneously determines \(m_{\rm top}\) and the JES from the data. At the Tevatron this method has been shown to minimize the uncertainty stemming from the imperfect knowledge of the JES [5]. This method essentially transforms the systematic uncertainty due to the JES uncertainty into an additional statistical uncertainty of \(m_{\rm top}\), however, with an overall reduced uncertainty. Given the different aims of the analyses and the different demands on the performance of the ATLAS detector, different choices have been made in various areas, most notably in the jet-definition and calibration.

The paper is organized as follows: the object definition and the event selection are described in Section 2, followed by a discussion of the principles of the template method and the pseudo-experiment techniques used to validate the method and to access the systematic uncertainties in Section 3. The specific details of the 1-d and 2-d analyses are given in Sections 4 and 5, and the evaluation of the systematic uncertainties is detailed in Section 6. Finally the summary and conclusions are given in Section 7.

## 2 Object definition and event selection

At the LHC proton-proton collider top-quarks are produced mainly in pairs and through gluon-gluon fusion processes for all proton-proton center-of-mass energies, \(\sqrt{s}\), considered in this analysis. As an example, the \(t\bar{t}\) production cross-section amounts to about 400 pb [6] when using the present value for \(m_{\rm top}\)[2], and for \(\sqrt{s}=10\) TeV, i.e. the value used for the Monte Carlo samples of this paper.

The SM top-quark decays into a \(W\) boson and a \(b\)-quark almost 100% of the time. The final state produced by a top-quark pair thus consists of two \(W\) bosons and two jets stemming from \(b\)-quarks. When one \(W\) boson decays into a pair of leptons while the other decays into quarks, the \(t\bar{t}\) event contains a charged lepton, missing transverse energy, \(E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}\), from the undetected neutrino, and four jets with high transverse momentum, two of which originate from \(b\)-quarks.

In this analysis, the focus is on \(t\bar{t}\to{\rm lepton}+{\rm jets}\) decays, with \({\rm lepton}=e,\mu\). Events are selected by means of a robust cut-based approach, mainly relying on observed isolated leptons, \(E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}\), and high-\(p_{\rm T}\) jets. On top of this, for the 2-d analysis also \(b\)-tagging and a kinematic fit are adopted.

The \(t\bar{t}\to{\rm lepton}+{\rm jets}\) event signature can be mimicked by other physics processes, or can be faked by mis-reconstruction, for example, due to jet-to-lepton mis-identification. Moreover, the genuine event jet multiplicity can be altered by additional jets from initial and final state radiation, ISR and FSR. Given the scope of low luminosity analyses, jets from additional proton-proton interactions are not investigated. The sources of physics background considered are: \(t\bar{t}\) events with all but the signal decay channels, single top production from the t-channel and Wt-channel processes 1), \(W/Z+{\rm jets}\) production, di-boson processes, and finally for the 1-d analysis also QCD multijet production. The samples were generated with various Monte Carlo programs: the signal with MC@NLO [7], the single top production with AcerMC [8], the \(W/Z+{\rm jets}\) process and the QCD multijet events with ALPGEN [9], and finally the di-boson processes with HERWIG [10], all assuming \(\sqrt{s}=10\) TeV. The available integrated luminosity of the signal sample amounts to several \({\rm fb}^{-1}\), the one for the background samples to several hundred \({\rm pb}^{-1}\), with the exception of the QCD multijet events, for which, due to their huge cross section, only a sample corresponding to about 10 \({\rm pb}^{-1}\) is available.

Footnote 1): Due to technical reasons, for the single top production there was no consistent set of Monte Carlo samples available that also included the s-channel process. However, since this is the smallest of the three single top contributions, and the background from single top processes is small, this is not a severe limitation.

The QCD multijet sample is dominated by jets stemming from gluons and light quarks and only has a small contribution from \(b\)-jets. The relative importance of the background processes for the two analyses will be discussed below. In the following the definitions of the reconstructed objects 2) considered and the requirements applied to them, as well as to the events, are listed.

Footnote 2): In the ATLAS right-handed coordinate system the \(x\)-axis points towards the center of the LHC ring, the \(y\)-axis points upwards and the \(z\)-axis points in the direction of the counter-clockwise running proton beam. The polar angle \(\theta\) and the azimuthal angle \(\phi\) are defined with respect to the \(z\)-axis and \(x\)-axis, respectively. The pseudo-rapidity is defined as \(\eta=-\ln(\tan(\theta/2))\) and the radial distance in \((\eta,\phi)\) space is \(\Delta{\rm R}=\sqrt{\Delta\eta^{2}+\Delta\phi^{2}}\).

* **Trigger:** A trigger signal of an electron or muon with transverse momentum above 15 GeV has to be present [11] (pp. 549-722).
* **Electrons:** High-\(p_{\rm T}\), isolated electrons with \(|\eta|<1.37\) or \(1.52<|\eta|<2.47\) and \(p_{\rm T}>20\) GeV are used [11] (pp. 43-159).
* **Muons:** High-\(p_{\rm T}\), isolated muons with \(|\eta|<2.5\) and \(p_{\rm T}>20\) GeV are used [11] (pp. 161-228).
* \({\bf E}_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}\): The missing transverse energy [11] (pp. 261-396) is calculated as the vector sum of the transverse energy coming from calorimeter cells and muons, applying correction factors for energy losses in material in front of the calorimeter. The cells belonging to reconstructed objects are further corrected using object-specific refined calibrations. A requirement of \(E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}>20\) GeV is used to help to distinguish between events with and without leptonic \(W\) boson decays.
* **Jets:** Jet candidates which are not consistent with stemming from electrons, and which fulfill \(|\eta|<2.5\) and \(p_{\rm T}>20\) GeV are used. This requirement is refined depending on the analysis.

As the 1-d analysis does not exploit \(b\)-tagging, to efficiently reject the background processes the kinematical requirements on the hadronic final state have to be rather strict. The jet definition and the additional requirements used for the 1-d analysis are:

* **Jet definition (1-d analysis):** Jet candidates are reconstructed from calorimeter towers with an iterative, seeded, fixed-size cone algorithm [11] (pp. 261-396) with \(\Delta\mathrm{R}=0.4\). The hadronic calibration of the jet candidates is done with a cell signal weighting procedure called H1-weighting [12].
* **Jets requirements (1-d analysis):** Events must contain at least four jets, of which at least one jet with \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>75\) GeV and at least two additional jets with \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>40\) GeV are required.
* **W boson mass window (1-d analysis):** The reconstructed \(W\) boson mass is required to be within a symmetric window of \(\pm 25\) GeV around the peak of the reconstructed \(W\) boson mass distribution in \(t\bar{t}\) signal events, which for the present analysis of the Monte Carlo samples is 77.5 GeV. The jet to \(W\) boson assignment is discussed in Section 4.

The 2-d analysis explores the strong background rejection power of \(b\)-tagging with an efficiency of 50% per \(b\)-jet and a mis-identification rate of light jets as \(b\)-jets of only about 1/820 [11] (pp. 397-548). The jet definition and requirements for the 2-d analysis are:

* **Jet definition (2-d analysis):** Jet candidates are reconstructed from topological clusters with the anti-\(k_{\mathrm{t}}\) algorithm [13] with \(\Delta\mathrm{R}=0.4\). Within the analysis the hadronic calibration of the jet candidates is performed separately for light jets and \(b\)-jets separated into those with and without muonic decays, as explained in Section 5.
* **Jets requirements (2-d analysis):** Events must contain exactly two calibrated \(b\)-jets with \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>40\) GeV and at least two calibrated light jets with \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>40\) GeV, where light jets are defined as jets that are not identified as \(b\)-jets.

Events are retained if exactly one high-\(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) and isolated lepton of one type is present, the corresponding trigger has fired, and no high-\(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) and isolated lepton of the other type is present.

For the 1-d analysis the \(t\bar{t}\rightarrow\mathrm{electron+jets}\) and \(t\bar{t}\rightarrow\mathrm{mu+jets}\) channels are considered individually. Here, the signal sample includes events with leptons produced directly from the \(W\) boson decays (e.g. \(W\rightarrow\mu\nu\)) and events with leptons from \(\tau\) decays (e.g. \(W\rightarrow\tau\nu_{\tau}\rightarrow\mu\nu_{\mu}\nu_{\tau}\)), and no attempt is made to separate the individual event classes, which for data would be difficult anyway. However, this sample is clearly dominated by \(t\bar{t}\rightarrow\mathrm{lepton+jets}\) events. For the 2-d analysis the lepton channels are combined, and for the signal events only direct leptonic \(W\) boson decays are considered. In addition to the above, requirements related to the kinematic fit explained in Section 5 have to be fulfilled. For both analyses, the numbers of events finally retained are shown in Table 1, for the signal, and the different background processes. The numbers are obtained using the predicted cross-sections for the LHC at \(\sqrt{s}=10\) TeV, and correspond to \(\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{int}}=100\) pb\({}^{-1}\). The quoted uncertainties are statistical only, and are derived by using the complete statistics available for each Monte Carlo sample, and scaled to \(\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{int}}=100\) pb\({}^{-1}\).

From these numbers, the different emphasis of the 1-d and 2-d analyses are clearly seen. On the one hand, the 1-d analysis has about eleven times the efficiency of the 2-d analysis. On the other hand, the 2-d analysis yields a signal-to-background ratio, S/B, which is about six times the one of the 1-d analysis. For the 2-d analysis no event from the \(W/Z\)+jets processes, i.e. the dominant background contribution for the 1-d analysis, survives, mainly because of the \(b\)-tagging requirement. Therefore, it is expected that the QCD multijet events would also efficiently be rejected, and, at present, these samples have not been considered.

## 3 Templates, likelihood and the pseudo-experiment technique

Both analyses utilize the template method to determine \(m_{\rm top}\) from the measured top-quark mass distributions, and for the 2-d analysis by also exploiting the distribution of the measured invariant mass of the \(W\) boson. Signal templates are derived for the distributions for the \(t\bar{t}\) signal events for different \(m_{\rm top}\) assumptions in the range [160-190], using specifically generated Monte Carlo samples available based on the fast ATLAS detector simulation. For the 2-d analysis for each mass point templates for different JES assumptions are also constructed. Any differences with respect to samples reconstructed with the full detector simulation will be treated as a systematic uncertainty as explained in Section 6.

A simultaneous fit to all templates is used to derive a continuous probability density function, \(P_{\rm sig}\), as a function of \(m_{\rm top}\) (and the JES) that interpolates shape differences of the distributions among all mass points (and JES assumptions). In contrast, the probability density function for the \(m_{W}^{\rm reco}\) distribution, used in the 2-d analysis, is taken to only depend on the JES. This approach rests on the assumption that each parameter of the fit functions has a linear dependence on the top-quark mass (and JES), which has been verified for both analyses, as reported in Sections 4 and 5.

Background templates are derived in a similar way. The background shape is taken from the sum of the Monte Carlo samples, using all processes considered as background, where the choice is different for the two analyses, as detailed below. As a result, for the 1-d analysis the probability density function for the background, \(P_{\rm bkg}\), is chosen to be \(m_{\rm top}\) independent, whereas for the 2-d analysis it is \(m_{\rm top}\) dependent.

The derived signal and background PDFs are used in an unbinned likelihood, \(\mathcal{L}\), fit to the data, where \(\mathcal{L}\)is defined as:

\[\mathcal{L}(m_{\rm top}^{\rm est}|m_{\rm top},JES) = \mathcal{L}_{\rm shape}(m_{\rm top}^{\rm est}|m_{\rm top},JES) \times\mathcal{L}_{\rm shape}(m_{W}^{\rm reco}|JES)\times\mathcal{L}_{\rm n_{ \rm s}+n_{\rm b}}\times\mathcal{L}_{\rm bkg}\]

Table 1: The numbers of selected signal and background events for the two analyses, assuming SM cross-sections at \(\sqrt{s}=10\) and quoted for a luminosity of \(\mathcal{L}_{\rm int}=100\). A ’\(-\)’ indicates that no event passed the selection, and ‘na’ means that this sample has not been investigated. The different horizontal lines for the 1-d and 2-d analyses indicate the different separation between signal and background events. Consequently, the numbers for the signal events for the 1-d analysis are the sum of the first three lines, whereas for the 2-d analysis the signal corresponds only to the \(t\bar{t}\to\) lepton\(+\)jets events.

with the top-quark mass estimators \(m_{\rm top}^{\rm est}=m_{\rm top}^{\rm stab}\) or \(m_{\rm top}^{\rm reco}\). Here \({\cal L}(m_{\rm top}^{\rm est}|m_{\rm top},JES)\) means that the term is based on the \(m_{\rm top}^{\rm est}\) distribution which depends on \(m_{\rm top}\) and the JES. For the 1-d analysis \(m_{\rm top}^{\rm est}=m_{\rm top}^{\rm stab}\), and since the likelihood does not depend on the JES, the term \({\cal L}_{\rm shape}\) (\(m_{W}^{\rm reco}\)) is not present. For the 2-d analysis \(m_{\rm top}^{\rm est}=m_{\rm top}^{\rm reco}\). The four individual likelihood components are defined as:

\[{\cal L}_{\rm shape}(m_{\rm top}^{\rm est}|m_{\rm top},JES) = \prod_{i=1}^{N}\frac{n_{\rm s}\cdot P_{\rm sig}(m_{\rm top}^{\rm est }|m_{\rm top},JES)_{i}+n_{\rm b}\cdot P_{\rm bkg}(m_{\rm top}^{\rm est}|m_{\rm top },JES)_{i}}{n_{\rm s}+n_{\rm b}}\;, \tag{2}\] \[{\cal L}_{\rm shape}(m_{W}^{\rm reco}|JES) = \prod_{i=1}^{N}\frac{n_{\rm s}\cdot P_{\rm sig}(m_{W}^{\rm reco}| JES)_{i}+n_{\rm b}\cdot P_{\rm bkg}(m_{W}^{\rm reco}|JES)_{i}}{n_{\rm s}+n_{\rm b}}\;,\] \[{\cal L}_{\rm n_{\rm s}+n_{\rm b}} = \frac{e^{-(n_{\rm s}+n_{\rm b})}\cdot(n_{\rm s}+n_{\rm b})^{N}}{N!}\;,\] \[{\cal L}_{\rm bkg} = \exp\left\{-\frac{(n_{\rm b}-n_{\rm b}^{\rm pred})^{2}}{2\sigma_ {m_{\rm b}^{\rm pred}}}\right\}.\]

The term \({\cal L}_{\rm shape}\) (\(m_{\rm top}^{\rm est}\)) is used to account for the shape of the \(m_{\rm top}^{\rm est}\) distribution and its dependences on the top quark mass \(m_{\rm top}\) and the JES, the term \({\cal L}_{\rm shape}\) (\(m_{W}^{\rm reco}\)) to constrain the JES, the term \({\cal L}_{\rm n_{\rm s}+n_{\rm b}}\) to obtain the relative contribution of signal, \(n_{\rm s}\), and background, \(n_{\rm b}\), events to all events, N, and finally \({\cal L}_{\rm bkg}\) to constrain the number of background events within its prediction, \(n_{\rm b}^{\rm pred}\), using an uncertainty of \(\sigma_{n_{\rm b}^{\rm pred}}=0.2\,n_{\rm b}^{\rm pred}\), motivated by the expected background uncertainty to be obtained from data driven methods for ATLAS data analysis. For the 1-d analysis the term \({\cal L}_{\rm n_{\rm s}+n_{\rm b}}\) is used to allow N to be adjusted by the fit. In the 2-d analysis N is fixed to the number of observed events, and consequently the term \({\cal L}_{\rm n_{\rm s}+n_{\rm b}}\) is not used. The free parameters of the fit are the numbers of signal and background events, \(m_{\rm top}\) and the JES. When exploring the shape of the likelihood function around its minimum the following abbreviation is used:

\[-2\ln L = -2\left[\ln{\cal L}(m_{\rm top}^{\rm est}|m_{\rm top},JES)-(\ln{ \cal L}(m_{\rm top}^{\rm est}|m_{\rm top},JES))_{\rm min}\right].\]

The validation of the template method and the determination of systematic uncertainties on \(m_{\rm top}\) uses the pseudo-experiment technique. In this technique, based on the probability density functions or the templates, or by drawing individual events, data sets are randomly constructed for signal and background events that mimic experimental data for a given integrated luminosity [14]. The numbers of signal and background events in these pseudo-experiments are Poisson fluctuated around their expectation values, calculated assuming SM cross-sections. With this technique the expected statistical precision of the method, its linearity with respect to \(m_{\rm top}\) and the JES, and also possible biases can be evaluated.

Pseudo-experiments also serve to evaluate systematic uncertainties by investigating variations with respect to the default case. For example, this is done by using templates obtained with changed parameters or from different Monte Carlo samples for constructing pseudo-experiments, without altering the probability density function parameterizations. The observed differences are used to estimate the systematic uncertainties. For the 1-d analysis pseudo-experiments are needed because of the sizeable contribution from physics background, and the limited available luminosity of the Monte Carlo samples for some of the background processes. Therefore, the analysis cannot fully profit from the statistical power of the signal Monte Carlo samples, without oversampling these simulated background samples. As a positive side effect, applying this technique allows for an estimation of the statistical uncertainty of the systematic uncertainties, see Section 6 for details.

The 2-d analysis has a very small background contamination. Therefore, many of the systematic uncertainties can be evaluated using the full signal sample, and here the impact of oversampling some of the background Monte Carlo samples is very small. For some of the sources pseudo-experiments are used as well, see Section 6 for details.

Although the general strategy is the same for both analyses they differ in several aspects, which are detailed in the next two sections.

## 4 The 1-d template analysis

For each of the selected events the three jets whose 4-vector sum yields the highest transverse momentum are interpreted as the products of the hadronically decaying top-quark, this is often referred to as the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{max}}\) method. Among the three jets associated to the hadronically decaying top-quark, the association of jets to the \(W\) boson is performed by choosing, in the reconstructed top-quark candidate rest-frame, the pair of jets with the smallest \(\Delta\mathrm{R}\). The \(t\bar{t}\) combinatorial background is defined as events with unmatched top-quark candidates, i.e. those that fail requirements on the angular and energy differences of the reconstructed and generated top-quark 4-vectors. With the chosen definitions, the fraction of events with a correct top-quark candidate to top-quark assignment amounts to 23%. Similarly, the \(t\bar{t}\) combinatorial background to the \(W\) boson mass distribution is obtained from candidates failing at least one of the angular and energy requirements on the difference of the reconstructed and generated \(W\) boson 4-vectors. The matching efficiency for the \(W\) boson, before applying the \(W\) boson mass window requirement, is about 14%, and increases to 44% for events in which the hadronically decaying top-quark was correctly matched. Using the jet assignments described above the \(m_{\mathrm{top}}^{\mathrm{stab}}\) distribution is obtained, where the ratio of the two reconstructed masses, \(m_{\mathrm{top}}^{\mathrm{reco}}\) and \(m_{W}^{\mathrm{reco}}\), is calculated event-by-event. The result is shown in Figures 1(a) and 1(b) for the electron and muon channel, respectively.

For the 1-d analysis, the use of the \(m_{\mathrm{top}}^{\mathrm{stab}}\) distribution instead of the conventionally used \(m_{\mathrm{top}}^{\mathrm{reco}}\) distribution considerably decreases the dependence on the JES uncertainty. This can be clearly seen from Figure 2 obtained for \(t\bar{t}\) signal events in the combined electron and muon channel. In the top row this figure shows that both mass distributions exhibit similar changes when \(m_{\mathrm{top}}\) is changed from 160 to 180 GeV. However, the variations observed in the distribution for \(m_{\mathrm{top}}=172.5\) GeV when changing the JES by \(\pm 5\)% are clearly much smaller when using \(m_{\mathrm{top}}^{\mathrm{stab}}\), as shown in the bottom row. The better stability against JES variations exhibited by \(m_{\mathrm{top}}^{\mathrm{stab}}\) with respect to \(m_{\mathrm{top}}^{\mathrm{reco}}\), more than compensates for its slightly reduced sensitivity to \(m_{\mathrm{top}}\) caused by the fact that the \(m_{\mathrm{top}}^{\mathrm{stab}}\) distribution is broader than the \(m_{\mathrm{top}}^{\mathrm{reco}}\) distribution. This is made explicit in Figure 3, which shows the shift in \(m_{\mathrm{top}}\) (approximated by the mean

The results are for \(t\bar{t}\) signal events in the combined electron and muon channel for \(\mathcal{L}_{\rm int}=500\) pb\({}^{-1}\). The points show the observed shift of the mean compared to the result for a JES of unity, the vertical bars indicate their one standard deviation statistical uncertainty, and the lines are linear fits to the points.

of the Gaussian used for \(P_{\rm sig}\), see below) as a function of the JES for the two variables.

Signal templates are derived for the \(m_{\rm top}^{\rm stab}\) distribution for \(m_{\rm top}\) values of [160, 170, 172.5, 180, 190] GeV. The fit function used is the sum of a Pearson type IV function [15] and a Gaussian, which well describes the observed distributions for this \(m_{\rm top}\) range. The Gaussian part of the fit adequately describes the distributions stemming from the fraction of events in which the reconstructed top-quark and \(W\) boson are both correctly matched to the real ones. For all seven parameters of the fit function, and for both channels, their linear dependence on \(m_{\rm top}\) has been verified. Consequently, a simultaneous fit to all templates is performed. The fit minimizes a \(\chi^{2}\) sum for all bins, built from the differences of the templates and the functional form, normalized to the statistical uncertainties of the templates. The fit qualities of the simultaneous fits to all templates are \(\chi^{2}/{\rm dof}=1.03\) (\(\chi^{2}/{\rm dof}=1.04\)), for 581 (629) degrees of freedom, and in the electron (muon) channel. The superposition of signal templates for four values of \(m_{\rm top}\), together with their corresponding fits, is shown in Figures 4(a) and 4(c) for the electron and muon channels.

The background is treated differently for the contributions that do not depend on \(m_{\rm top}\) and the contributions that explicitly depend on \(m_{\rm top}\). For the \(m_{\rm top}\) independent part the background shape is taken from Monte Carlo samples, summing all contributions from \(W/Z+\)jets events, di-boson production, and QCD multijet processes. Due to the lack of Monte Carlo statistics available for the QCD multijet back

ground to build an independent shape, the shape of its distribution is approximated by that of the most prominent one, namely the one from the \(W/Z\)+jets background events. For these background processes the sum of a Gaussian and a Gamma function is chosen to parameterize the \(m_{\rm top}^{\rm stab}\) distribution. The adequate description of the background distribution by this fit can be seen from Figures 4(b) and 4(d) for the electron and muon channels. Ultimately, it has to be determined from the data, which will be attempted using the so-called matrix method [16]. Applying this method to Monte Carlo samples composed for \(\mathcal{L}_{\rm int}=150\) pb\({}^{-1}\) and with deliberately unknown S/B, the background fraction could be determined with a statistical precision of about 3%.

The contributions from the \(t\bar{t}\to\) all-jets and single top events are kept separate, since their \(m_{\rm top}^{\rm stab}\) distributions explicitly depend on \(m_{\rm top}\), thereby containing valuable information on \(m_{\rm top}\). At present, these contaminations are accounted for in the pseudo-experiments by adding their expected contributions to the number of generated signal events, neglecting possible shape differences. For the luminosities under study this is justified, since the shape differences between the \(m_{\rm top}^{\rm stab}\) distributions of \(t\bar{t}\to\) lepton+jets events and single top events are statistically insignificant up to luminosities of 100 pb\({}^{-1}\). For \(t\bar{t}\to\) all-jets events this holds up to \(\mathcal{L}_{\rm int}=1\) fb\({}^{-1}\).

The expected statistical uncertainty of \(m_{\rm top}\) derived from (200, 100, 50) pseudo-experiments assuming \(m_{\rm top}=172.5\) GeV, \(\sqrt{s}=10\) TeV, the SM background fraction, and for integrated luminosities of (10, 30, 100) pb\({}^{-1}\) are reported in Table 2. For \(\sqrt{s}=7\) TeV, i.e. the value chosen for early LHC running, the SM background fraction increases to 52% (53%) for the electron (muon) channel, and the signal cross-section decreases such that the expected statistical uncertainty is about twice as large 3.

Footnote 3: For these estimates the numbers of expected events are derived from the samples simulated at \(\sqrt{s}=10\) TeV together with the ratio of the Monte Carlo cross-section predictions for \(\sqrt{s}=7\) TeV and \(\sqrt{s}=10\) TeV. Consequently, only the normalization of signal and background events are changed, and the shape of the \(m_{\rm top}^{\rm stab}\) distributions are left unchanged.

Using the pseudo-experiments from Table 2 the stability of the method is investigated based on the resulting pull distribution from the measured \(m_{\rm top}\) and the input value, \(m_{\rm top}^{\rm in}\) used to generate the Monte Carlo samples. The mean value of \(0.96\pm 0.03\) (\(1.00\pm 0.04\)) and the width of \(-0.04\pm 0.03\) (\(-0.03\pm 0.04\)) for the electron (muon) channel, is consistent with the expectations of one and zero. Typical pseudo-experiment results are shown in Figure 5 corresponding to 10 pb\({}^{-1}\) and 100 pb\({}^{-1}\) of data, generated assuming \(m_{\rm top}=172.5\) GeV for the electron (left) and muon (right) channels.

## 5 The 2-d template analysis

In the 2-d analysis, similarly to [5], both \(m_{\rm top}\) and the JES are determined simultaneously by using the \(m_{\rm top}^{\rm reco}\) and \(m_{W}^{\rm reco}\) distributions 4. Here \(m_{\rm top}^{\rm reco}\) depends on \(m_{\rm top}\) and the JES, whereas \(m_{W}^{\rm reco}\) is only sensitive to the JES and only to light jets, see Equation 2. Since the JES is known to be different for light jets and

\(b\)-jets, this difference has to be removed, which here is achieved by a specific calibration relying on the predicted difference taken from the signal Monte Carlo.

At the moment the calibration solely depends on the jet energies, i.e. possible correlations to the jet rapidity are neglected. This will be revisited for the analysis of ATLAS data. Calibration factors are obtained for three jet samples [11] (pp. 898-924): light jets (i.e. non \(b\)-jets), and \(b\)-jets without and with muonic decays, defined as \(b\)-jets close to identified muons within \(\Delta\mathrm{R}=0.25\). The calibration factors are determined as the ratio of the quark energy and the reconstructed jet energy for matched jets in bins of the reconstructed jet energy and fitted to obtain a continuous function. The matching procedure assigns reconstructed jets to quarks if they are within \(\Delta\mathrm{R}=0.25\). The efficiency of correct jet-to-quark assignments is more than 95%.

The calibration factors for the three samples are shown in Figure 6(a). For the ATLAS data analysis the light jet calibration will not be taken from Monte Carlo samples alone, but rather mostly from the data. Only the relative calibration of the \(b\)-jets with respect to the light jets rests solely on the Monte Carlo prediction. The relative calibration factors are shown in Figure 6(b) separately for \(b\)-jets with and

The parameters used are \(m_{\mathrm{top}}=172.5\) GeV, \(\sqrt{s}=10\) TeV and \(\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{int}}=10,\ 100\) pb\({}^{-1}\)(top, bottom). The results for the electron channel are shown on the left, the ones for the muon channel on the right.

without muonic decays. For both types they quickly decrease with increasing energy. The largest factors of up to 1.4 are obtained for \(b\)-jets with muonic decays and energies of 40 GeV. However, \(b\)-jets with muonic decays only occur in about 20% of the events. The relative calibration factors for \(b\)-jets without muonic decays are below 1.1. Given the kinematical selection of the events the average observed relative calibration factor using both types of \(b\)-jets is 1.04. The proper understanding of this calibration is imperative for the analysis. This in turn means that, to make full use of the 2-d analysis, a detailed understanding of the \(b\)-tagging performance of ATLAS, and its implementation into the Monte Carlo description of the ATLAS detector, is required. This is because it will limit the understanding of the relative \(b\)-jet to light jet calibration, which at present constitutes the largest systematic uncertainty, see Section 6.

A kinematic fit using the leptonic and the hadronic top-quark decay candidates is performed. For this the 4-vector of the neutrino from the leptonically decaying \(W\) boson is constructed using the components of the \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\) as estimates of the transverse momentum components, and calculating the longitudinal momentum from the requirement that the lepton-neutrino invariant mass has to match \(m_{W}\) within the \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\) resolution. This procedure leads to a solution in 87% of all cases. The calibrated jets and the two leptons are used in a \(\chi^{2}\) minimization procedure that contains five terms: the sum of the differences of the measured and fitted energies of the five measured 4-vectors individually divided by their uncertainties; the differences of \(m_{W}^{\mathrm{reco}}\) and \(m_{W}\), for the leptonic and hadronic \(W\) boson candidates each divided by \(\Gamma_{W}\)5[4]; and the differences of the \((q,q,b)\) and \((\ell,\nu,b)\) invariant masses and \(m_{\mathrm{top}}^{\mathrm{reco}}\), for the leptonic and hadronic top-quark candidates, individually corrected for their bias and divided by their respective resolution. The jet resolution amounts to 10% on average. The biases of the reconstructed leptonic and hadronic top-quark masses that are induced by the jet \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) requirements are 0.4 GeV and 0.7 GeV. Finally, the \(m_{\mathrm{top}}^{\mathrm{reco}}\) resolution amounts to 15 GeV and 10 GeV, for the leptonic and hadronic top-quark masses. During the minimization procedure the measured energies are allowed to vary in the range [0,2] of the initial energy. The \(\chi^{2}\) function is minimized with respect to the energies and \(m_{\mathrm{top}}^{\mathrm{reco}}\) by using all possible combinations within the light jet pair assignment, the \(b\)-jet assignments to the \(W\) boson candidates, and the solutions for the longitudinal momentum of the neutrino. In addition, only those light jet pairs that

All calibration factors are derived from the \(t\bar{t}\) signal Monte Carlo sample corresponding to \(\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{int}}=7.6\) fb\({}^{-1}\), and the uncertainties are statistical only.

yield a value for \(m_{W}^{\rm reco}\) within \(\pm\) 30 GeV around the peak value of the \(m_{W}^{\rm reco}\) distribution of 82 GeV are considered for the fit. Finally, events are accepted if the smallest \(\chi^{2}\) is below three.

The numbers of events retained are listed in Table 1. The kinematic fit improves the S/B from 3.7 to 8.0 and leads to high object purities. Using the above mentioned conditions for matching reconstructed jets to quarks, the \(W\) purity, i.e. the fraction of events for which the light jet pair is correctly chosen is \((80.8\pm 0.6)\%\), and the \(b\)-jet purity, i.e. the fraction of events in which both \(b\)-jets are assigned to the correct \(b\)-quarks is \((72.1\pm 0.7)\%\). The top-quark purity of \((62.1\pm 0.8)\%\) is the combination of these two correlated purities, and the quoted uncertainties are statistical.

The \(m_{\rm top}^{\rm reco}\) distributions for signal events, background events, and the sum of both are shown in Figure 7(a) for \(\mathcal{L}_{\rm int}=1\) fb\({}^{-1}\). Compared to Figure 1 from the 1-d analysis the improved S/B and the narrower top-quark mass peak are clearly visible. The \(m_{W}^{\rm reco}\) distribution from the corresponding light jet combinations for signal events is shown in Figure 7(b). To remove possible biases on \(m_{W}^{\rm reco}\) originating from the \(m_{\rm top}^{\rm reco}\) obtained by the kinematic fit, only the choice of the light jet pair by the fit is retained, but the initial reconstructed jet energies before applying the kinematic fit are used.

Also shown in Figure 7(a) is the fit function used for the signal \(m_{\rm top}^{\rm reco}\) template, which is a sum of two Gaussians and a Gamma function, where their relative importance has been adjusted to optimize the description of the distribution. It has been verified that all six parameters depend linearly on \(m_{\rm top}\) and the JES. Consequently, they are obtained by a simultaneous fit to the five \(m_{\rm top}^{\rm reco}\) templates within [160-190] GeV.

Since the background template is constructed from \(t\bar{t}\) and single top events, the background fit is taken to be \(m_{\rm top}\) dependent. In this case, the fit function shown in Figure 7(a) is a single Gaussian and a Gamma function, where again their relative importance has been adjusted. The fit function used for the \(m_{W}^{\rm reco}\) template shown in Figure 7(b) is a Gaussian. Also here it has been verified that the mean of the Gaussian depends linearly on the JES within the range [0.95-1.05], and the sigma of the Gaussian is taken to be JES independent.

For \(m_{\rm top}^{\rm reco}\) the resulting correlations to \(m_{\rm top}^{\rm in}\) and JES\({}^{\rm in}\) as predicted by the template fit are shown in Figures 8(a) and 8(b), clearly showing the linear correlation to both variables in a large range with small width.

When performing pseudo-experiments the 2-d analysis needs to use individual events to properly account for the correlation of \(m_{\rm top}^{\rm reco}\) and \(m_{W}^{\rm reco}\). Since the MC@NLO program assigns negative event

weights to about 14% of the selected events, using those events would lead to an ill behaved unbinned likelihood fit 6). To properly deal with this complication the 2-d analysis uses a pseudo-likelihood. Using this, and performing 1-d fits where the other parameter is fixed to its input value, the individual statistical uncertainties are estimated. For \(\mathcal{L}_{\text{int}}=1\) fb\({}^{-1}\) they amount to 0.4 GeV and 0.004 for \(m_{\text{top}}\) and the JES, respectively. When performing a 2-d fit and identifying the total uncertainty on \(m_{\text{top}}\) with the quadratic sum of the above uncertainty and the contribution due to the JES, the latter can be evaluated. With this method, the JES contribution to the statistical uncertainty of \(m_{\text{top}}\) is 1.3 GeV for \(\mathcal{L}_{\text{int}}=100\) pb\({}^{-1}\), and 0.4 GeV for 1 fb\({}^{-1}\).

Footnote 6): For the 1-d analysis only the information on \(m_{\text{top}}^{\text{tab}}\) is needed, which is contained in the \(m_{\text{top}}^{\text{stab}}\) histogram and therefore individual events are not needed for constructing the pseudo-experiments. Here negative weights in the likelihood fit are avoided by drawing \(m_{\text{top}}^{\text{stab}}\) values from the histogram. Although the histogram is built from the sum of positive and negative weight events, the bin contents are always positive.

The result of the 2-d fit for \(\mathcal{L}_{\text{int}}=1\) fb\({}^{-1}\) is shown in Figure 9. It yields fitted values of

The red star indicates the input values, the black cross the fitted values, of the two parameters, and the ellipses show their statistical uncertainty contours for \(n=1\ldots 5\) standard deviations.

\((172.6\pm 0.6)\) GeV and \(JES=1.000\pm 0.005\) for input values of \(m_{\rm top}^{\rm in}=172.5\) GeV and \(\rm JES^{\rm in}=1\) used to generate the Monte Carlo sample. The stability of the fit with respect to the JES is evaluated by splitting the signal and background samples into eleven statistically independent samples and varying \(\rm JES^{\rm in}\) within [0.95-1.05]. Within statistics, the fitted \(m_{\rm top}\) is independent of \(\rm JES^{\rm in}\), and also the fitted JES is linearly correlated to \(\rm JES^{\rm in}\) with a slope of unity and no offset. The stability of the fit with respect to \(m_{\rm top}\) is evaluated similarly by using the five signal samples at different \(m_{\rm top}\) input masses. Again, within statistics, the fitted JES is independent of \(m_{\rm top}^{\rm in}\), and also the fitted \(m_{\rm top}\) is linearly correlated to \(m_{\rm top}^{\rm in}\) with a slope of unity and no offset. Consequently, at the level of the statistical power of these tests, the 2-d procedure determines the two parameters without bias.

To investigate the stability of the method one hundred pseudo-experiments corresponding to \(\mathcal{L}_{\rm int}=100\) pb\({}^{-1}\) each, are performed for the central mass points and twenty for all other mass points. The mean and width of the obtained pull distributions are analyzed again, as for the linearity investigation, for JES variations within [0.95-1.05], and the five mass points in \(m_{\rm top}\). Two examples are shown in Figure 10. The mean of the \(m_{\rm top}\) pull distribution as a function of \(\rm JES^{\rm in}\) is shown in Figure 10(a), while Figure 10(b) shows the same quantity for the JES vs. \(m_{\rm top}^{\rm in}\). Within their statistical uncertainties, for all eight distributions the pull mean and width are consistent with the expectations of zero and one. The resulting bias on \(m_{\rm top}^{\rm in}\) (\(\rm JES^{\rm in}\)) is small, see Figure 10, and will not be corrected for.

To investigate the performance of the fit in exactly the way it is foreseen to be used for the data analysis, only the relative \(b\)-jet to light jet calibration is applied. Based on this, and using only the signal Monte Carlo sample at \(m_{\rm top}=172.5\) GeV, the parameters \(m_{\rm top}\) and JES are evaluated. The jet-to-quark energy ratio, i.e. the un-calibrated JES for light jets for \(p_{\rm T}>40\) GeV is shown in Figure 11(a), together with a Gaussian fit that results in a mean value of \(\rm JES^{\rm in}=0.9876\pm 0.0003\). The Figure 11(b) reports the obtained values of \(m_{\rm top}=(172.3\pm 0.6)\) GeV and \(JES=0.984\pm 0.006\), together with their uncertainty contours. Both values are consistent with their input values, which proves that they can be obtained without bias, provided that the relative calibration taken from Monte Carlo samples properly reflects the situation in ATLAS data.

Figure 10: The mean of the \(m_{\rm top}\) pull distribution as a function of the input \(\rm JES^{\rm in}\) is shown on the left, and the mean of the JES pull distribution as a function of the input \(m_{\rm top}^{\rm in}\) on the right. The red line is the expectation and the blue line the fit of a constant to the points.

## 6 Systematic uncertainties

Due to the limitation of the background samples explained above, for the 1-d analysis the general technique adopted to evaluate systematic uncertainties is performing pseudo-experiments and evaluating systematic differences with respect to the standard analysis. If possible, each source of uncertainty considered is investigated by variations of \(\pm 1\sigma\) with respect to the default case. Using the changed parameters, pseudo-experiments are performed directly, or templates are constructed that are subsequently used for pseudo-experiments, without altering the probability density function parameterizations. If not otherwise stated, the resulting maximum absolute difference \(\Delta m_{\mathrm{top}}=\max\left[\Delta m_{\mathrm{top}}(+\sigma),\Delta m_{ \mathrm{top}}(-\sigma)\right]\) to \(m_{\mathrm{top}}^{\mathrm{in}}\) obtained from an average over 10 pseudo-experiments corresponding to \(\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{int}}=500\) pb\({}^{-1}\), is taken as the systematic uncertainty. The statistical uncertainty of this estimate is taken as the RMS of the distribution of pseudo-experiment results divided by \(\sqrt{10}\). For many sources of systematic uncertainties the 2-d analysis can profit from the statistical power of the full signal sample, since here, thanks to the small background contribution, the impact of the oversampling of the background samples is very small. If the pseudo-experiment technique is explored for the 2-d analysis, 100 pseudo-experiments corresponding to \(\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{int}}=100\) pb\({}^{-1}\) are used. Here, generally not the maximum difference but the average difference of the \(\pm 1\sigma\) samples is used as estimate of the systematic uncertainty.

The sources of systematic uncertainties investigated, together with the resulting uncertainties, are listed in Table 3. For the results of the 1-d analysis the two decay channels are separately reported, evaluated for \(\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{int}}=100\) pb\({}^{-1}\). For every source of systematic uncertainty the two channels are consistent within the statistical precision of the systematic uncertainties. The value quoted is the larger of the observed shift and its statistical uncertainty. For the 2-d analysis the improvement with increasing luminosity is highlighted by quoting the results for the combined channel for \(\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{int}}=100\) pb\({}^{-1}\)and 1 fb\({}^{-1}\). Many sources are in common for both analyses, however, there are a number of sources that only apply to one of the analyses. In those cases the corresponding entry for the other analysis is marked as 'na'. Neglecting possible correlations, the total uncertainty is calculated as the quadratic sum of all individual contributions. The estimation of the uncertainties from the individual sources will be described in some detail in the following.

Figure 11: The JES for light jets with \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>40\) GeV without the calibration and using the full sample (left). The results for \(m_{\mathrm{top}}\) and the JES using only the relative \(b\)-jet to light jet calibration and for \(\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{int}}=1\) pb\({}^{-1}\). The black cross indicates the fitted values of the two parameters, and the ellipses show their statistical uncertainty contours for \(n=1\ldots 5\) standard deviations.

**Method calibration:** The limited statistics of the Monte Carlo samples lead to a systematic uncertainty of the template fits. For the 1-d analysis, the \(m_{\rm top}^{\rm stab}\) distributions used to determine the fitting functions are smeared bin-by-bin according to statistics 100 times. The smeared distributions are used to derive 100 different PDFs to be used to fit a given pseudo-data distribution. In this way the 'data' are fixed, while different fitting functions are used. The resulting \(m_{\rm top}\) values are distributed according to a Gaussian. The width of this Gaussian, averaged over 10 different pseudo-experiments, is taken as the corresponding uncertainty. The procedure has been applied separately for signal and background templates, and the value quoted is the quadratic sum of the two. For the 2-d analysis this source is estimated by the shift in \(m_{\rm top}\) observed at 172.5  when exploring the one standard deviation uncertainty of the linear correlation of \(m_{\rm top}\) to \(m_{\rm top}^{\rm in}\).

**Specific choice of signal Monte Carlo:** The systematic uncertainty related to the choice of the generator program is accounted for by comparing the results of pseudo-experiments carried out using the MC@NLO and the AcerMC samples generated with \(m_{\rm top}=172.5\). Here, the full difference is quoted as systematic uncertainty.

**Initial and final state QCD radiation:** Different amounts of ISR and FSR can alter the jet multiplicity of the events, and as a consequence introduce distortions into the measured distributions. This effect is evaluated by performing pseudo-experiments for which signal templates are derived from two dedicated signal samples. They use a changed QCD parameter \(\Lambda\), which is separately chosen for ISR and FSR to change their relative importance. The first sample uses \(2\Lambda\) for FSR and \(\Lambda\)/2 for ISR processes, for the second this choice is reversed. For both analyses the maximum difference in mean \(m_{\rm top}\) for the two samples with respect to the input top-quark mass is taken as the systematic uncertainty.

**Proton PDF:** The signal samples are generated using the CTEQ6 [17] proton parton distribution

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|c|} \hline \multicolumn{4}{|c|}{Statistical and systematic uncertainties [GeV]} \\ \hline  & \multicolumn{2}{|c|}{1-d per channel} & \multicolumn{2}{|c|}{2-d combined} \\ \cline{2-4}  & Electron & Muon & \\ \hline Statistics 100 (1000) pb\({}^{-1}\) & 2.7 & 2.8 & 1.8 (0.6) \\ \hline Method calibration & 0.8 & 0.6 & 0.4 \\ Signal MC generator (AcerMC vs. MC@NLO) & 0.8 & 1.3 & 0.5 \\ ISR and FSR (signal only) & 2.5 & 1.1 & 1.0 \\ Proton PDF uncertainty & 1.1 & 0.8 & 0.1 \\ Fast vs. full sim (signal only) & 0.6 & 0.7 & 0.2 \\ \hline Assumed background fraction (\(\pm\)50\%, \({}^{+100}_{-50}\)%) & 0.8 & 0.9 & 0.1 \\ \(W/Z\)+jets background SHERPA vs. ALPGEN & 0.5 & 0.5 & na \\ Alternative QCD shape & 0.6 & 0.5 & na \\ Single-top shape & 0.8 & 0.3 & na \\ \hline Jet energy scale (\(\pm\)5\%) & 1.4 & 2.2 & na \\ Relative \(b\)-jet to light jet energy scale (\(\pm\)2.5\%) & 1.6 & 2.1 & 1.6 \\ \hline \(b\)-tagging performance & na & na & 0 \\ \(E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}\)(\(\pm\)5\%) & na & na & 0.2 \\ Jet energy resolution (\(\pm\)20\%) & na & na & 0.1 \\ \hline Total systematic & 3.8 & 3.9 & 2.0 \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 3: Contributions of various sources to the systematic uncertainty of \(m_{\rm top}\) for \(\sqrt{s}=10\). A systematic uncertainty quoted as 0 means that the actual number was below 0.05  and ‘na’ means that this uncertainty does not apply to the corresponding analysis.

functions, PDFs 7). These PDFs, obtained from experimental data, have an uncertainty that is reflected in 20 pairs of additional PDF sets provided by the CTEQ group. To fully evaluate the impact of the PDF uncertainty on the templates full event simulations would have to be done based on each of these sets. This is because a changed PDF not only changes the probability of the hard interaction at a given kinematic configuration of the incoming partons, but also the specific configurations chosen for the parton showering in the event generation. Here, the approximate solution is followed to reweight the events with the corresponding ratio of PDFs and construct 20 pairs of additional signal templates. Using these templates pseudo-experiments for signal events are performed. The uncertainty is calculated as half the quadratic sum of differences of the 20 pairs as suggested in [17].

Footnote 7: Not to be confused with the probability density functions, PDFs, obtained for the templates.

**Fast versus full detector simulation:** The signal sample at \(m_{\rm top}=172.5\) GeV, as well as most of the background samples considered, were processed via the full ATLAS detector simulation. In contrast, the signal samples for different \(m_{\rm top}\), which are used to construct the templates for varying \(m_{\rm top}\), are only available in fast simulation. Since the signal sample at \(m_{\rm top}=172.5\) GeV is also available in fast detector simulation, for this particular mass value, an investigation of this differences is possible. Two sets of pseudo-experiments are performed using the \(m_{\rm top}^{\rm stab}\) templates derived from samples generated with \(m_{\rm top}=172.5\) GeV for both the fast and the full detector simulation dataset. For the 2-d analysis the calibration factors for the sample with the full ATLAS detector simulation are recomputed and applied to the reconstructed jets, before the 2-d fit is performed. The full difference is taken as systematic uncertainty.

**Treatment of physics background:** At present the systematic uncertainty on \(m_{\rm top}\) stemming from the treatment of physics background reactions has to be solely taken from Monte Carlo simulated events, despite the fact of limited statistics available, especially for the QCD multijet events. For the uncertainty estimate of the 1-d analysis three sources have been taken into account. Firstly the influence of the limited knowledge of the normalization of the total background fraction is taken into account by altering the initial background fraction by \(\pm 50\%\). Secondly the impact of the variation of the shape of the \(W/Z\)+jets background contribution is studied by replacing the \(W/Z\)+jets background predicted by the ALPGEN program by that of the SHERPA [18] program. Finally, the uncertainty stemming from the fact that, due to lacking statistics, the shape of the QCD multijet background is approximated by that of the \(W/Z\)+jets processes is evaluated. For this a QCD enriched sample is selected by loosening the lepton requirement, leading to a sample with about 4% \(t\bar{t}\) signal events, 3% \(W/Z\)+jets events, and 92% QCD multijet events. Assuming that the relative difference of the \(m_{\rm top}^{\rm stab}\) distributions of the \(W/Z\)+jets and QCD multijet events after this selection is preserved after the full event selection pseudo-experiments are performed. For each of the three sources the full difference is taken as the corresponding systematic uncertainty. With the advent of ATLAS data this systematic uncertainty will be determined from the data. For the 2-d analysis the S/B is so large that a generous variation of the background is used by multiplying and dividing the expected numbers of events by a factor of two and using the full samples. Given the rejection power against the \(W/Z\)+jets events the QCD multijet process is neglected.

**Shape of the single top background distribution (1-d only):** For the 1-d analysis, as motivated above, in the default procedure for the pseudo-experiments the \(t\bar{t}\to\) all-jets and single top contributions only change the signal normalization, thereby neglecting possible differences in shape between the \(m_{\rm top}^{\rm stab}\) distributions of the different processes. To evaluate the systematic uncertainty due to this simplification, pseudo-experiments are performed, in which both the signal events and the single top contribution are individually taken from the corresponding Monte Carlo \(m_{\rm top}^{\rm stab}\) distributions for the sample at \(m_{\rm top}=172.5\) GeV.

**Jet energy scale (1-d only):** In the evaluation of this uncertainty, for the moment only a possible global mismatch of the JES for the data and the Monte Carlo sample is accounted for. To numerically evaluate the systematic uncertainty stemming from the JES uncertainty, for the 1-d analysis the energy of all jets in the event is changed by \(\pm\)5%, and the \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\) is recomputed accordingly for the signal and all background processes. The event selection is repeated, and the corresponding templates are constructed. Then pseudo-experiments are performed using as input the altered templates.

For the 2-d analysis this uncertainty is of statistical nature and changes with luminosity. When using \(\eta\) dependent calibration factors for data, also a possible \(\eta\) dependent mismatch of the JES between data and Monte Carlo samples will have to be accounted for.

**b-jet energy scale:** For the 1-d analysis, to take into account a possible difference of the JES for light jets and for \(b\)-jets, only the JES for \(b\)-jets is changed, this time assuming a remaining \(\pm\)2.5% difference, and only using the signal events. Using the signal sample alone is justified, since for an event selection without a \(b\)-tagging requirement, the background events are dominated by contributions from light jets. This uncertainty, which only accounts for the remaining differences between light jets and \(b\)-jets after the global JES has been determined, is expected to be smaller than the JES uncertainty. The assumed value of \(\pm\)2.5% is a conservative estimate motivated by the results of an investigation of the differences of the reconstructed jets and those obtained from stable particles in the signal Monte Carlo sample. For the 2-d analysis the \(b\)-jet energy scale has been varied in the range [0.9, 1.1], while keeping the JES fixed at unity. The resulting variation of \(m_{\mathrm{top}}\) for the full sample is linear, and amounts to 0.64 GeV per % of change of the \(b\)-jet energy scale. As for the 1-d analysis, the value quoted in Table 3 assumes a remaining difference of the light jet and \(b\)-jet energy scales of \(\pm\)2.5%.

**b-tagging performance (2-d only):** The \(b\)-tagging efficiency has been changed by \(\pm\)5% which simultaneously changes the mis-identification rate by about a factor of 1.8. The resulting difference of the fitted \(m_{\mathrm{top}}\) is below 0.05 GeV, which is conservatively taken as estimate of the systematic uncertainty from this source. This shows that the analysis is not very sensitive to the absolute performance of the \(b\)-tagging. However, since any difference in \(b\)-tagging performance between data and Monte Carlo would lead to wrong assignments of the jet type, and thereby to wrongly applied calibration factors, a good understanding is important to properly control the relative \(b\)-jet to light jet calibration.

**\(\mathbf{E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}}\) resolution (2-d only):** Since here the \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\) is not only used as an event selection requirement, but also enters the kinematic fit and possibly changes the fitted value for \(m_{\mathrm{top}}\), the impact of its uncertainty is evaluated. Half the difference of the fitted \(m_{\mathrm{top}}\) obtained when changing the \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\) by \(\pm\)5% is used as estimate of the systematic uncertainty from this source.

**Jet energy resolution (2-d only):** The jet energy resolution also has a direct impact on the kinematic fit, e.g. the values of the biases on the reconstructed leptonic and hadronic top-quark masses discussed in Section 5 are a direct result of the interplay of the jet \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) requirements and the jet resolution. In addition, the performance of the requirement on the maximum \(\chi^{2}\) value is affected by this. The full difference of the fitted \(m_{\mathrm{top}}\) obtained with an additional Gaussian smearing of the jet energy by 20% is used as estimate of the systematic uncertainty from this source [11] (pp. 869-1037).

For the 1-d analysis the results for the two channels are consistent. A combination of the two channels leads to a statistical uncertainty of 2.0 GeV, to be compared with 1.8 GeV achieved with the 2-d analysis at the same luminosity. This is a consequence of a better S/B ratio achieved in the 2-d analysis via a tighter event selection adopting \(b\)-tagging, and a more refined \(m_{\mathrm{top}}^{\mathrm{reco}}\) reconstruction using the kinematic fit. This results in a reduced width of the \(m_{\mathrm{top}}^{\mathrm{reco}}\) distribution of the 2-d analysis compared to the \(m_{\mathrm{top}}^{\mathrm{stab}}\) distribution of the 1-d analysis, which more than compensates the additional contribution from the JES, i.e. the JES contributes 1.3 GeV to the 1.8 GeV  see Section 5.

For both analysis the largest contributions to the systematic uncertainty arise from the combination of the JES and the remaining difference between the energy scales of the \(b\)-jets and the light jets. The consistency of the two results on \(m_{\mathrm{top}}\), obtained with rather different strategies to measure it, gives confidence in the stability of the result. In summary, on the one hand, the 1-d analysis gives a result based on minimal information of the event, and can be applied already at an earlier stage of the understanding of the ATLAS detector. On the other hand, the 2-d analysis reveals its full potential and providesa considerably reduced systematic uncertainty, once a more mature understanding of the detector- and reconstruction performance has been achieved, and a larger data set has been recorded.

## 7 Summary and conclusion

In this paper, the prospects for a top-quark mass measurement via the template method in the \(t\bar{t}\to\) lepton\(+\)jets channel based on first ATLAS proton-proton collision data are investigated. Two complementary analysis are presented, a 1-d analysis that makes use of a new variable, \(m_{\rm top}^{\rm stab}\), to reduce the systematic uncertainty on \(m_{\rm top}\) stemming from the jet energy scale uncertainty, and a 2-d analysis that explores \(b\)-tagging and a kinematic fit to simultaneously determine \(m_{\rm top}\) and the JES from the distributions of the reconstructed top-quark and \(W\) boson masses. Making use of more event features, the 2-d analysis offers a more precise determination of \(m_{\rm top}\), albeit at the price of the need for a more detailed understanding of the detector performance as is required for performing the 1-d analysis. Both analyses lead to consistent results on the Monte Carlo samples. For data analysis, the interplay between the two methods will be a key ingredient for the timely commissioning of the more elaborate one.

For the 1-d analysis and assuming \(\sqrt{s}=10\) TeV, the statistical uncertainty of the top-quark mass measurement in the electron or muon channel is expected to be about \(10(3)\) GeV for \({\cal L}_{\rm int}=10(100)\) pb\({}^{-1}\). Both channels give consistent results, and combining them leads to a statistical uncertainty of 2.0 GeV for \({\cal L}_{\rm int}=100\) pb\({}^{-1}\). The total systematic uncertainty is estimated to be about 3.8 GeV for each channel, still dominated by the systematic uncertainty from the jet energy scale uncertainties for light jets and \(b\)-jets. However, compared to using the \(m_{\rm top}^{\rm reco}\) distribution, this systematic uncertainty is reduced by a factor of three.

For the 2-d analysis and assuming \(\sqrt{s}=10\) TeV, the statistical uncertainty of the top-quark mass measurement in the combined channel is expected to be of the order of 1.8(0.6) GeV, for \({\cal L}_{\rm int}=100\) pb\({}^{-1}\) (1 fb\({}^{-1}\)), and the total systematic uncertainty is about 2.0 GeV. At lower luminosities, also here the dominating contribution is due to the jet energy scale uncertainties for light jets and \(b\)-jets. At larger luminosities, the relative difference between the \(b\)-jet and light jet energy scales dominates. Due to the simultaneous determination of the JES, the overall systematic uncertainty on \(m_{\rm top}\) decreases with increasing luminosity, such that the method will develop its full power for the 1 fb\({}^{-1}\)of data to be expected with the upcoming 2010-2011 LHC run.
