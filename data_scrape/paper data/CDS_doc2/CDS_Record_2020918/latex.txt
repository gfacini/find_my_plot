###### Abstract

The 4-layer Pixel Detector with the recently installed innermost layer called IBL (Insertable B-Layer) saw its first data during the 2014 fall cosmic run. The difference between the cluster properties of planar and 3D sensors equipping the IBL are discussed. Lorentz angles of \(\alpha_{L}(Pix)=201\pm 10\,\mathrm{mrad}\) and \(\alpha_{L}(IBL_{Pl})=224\pm 15\,\mathrm{mrad}\) have been measured for the pixel layers and the IBL planar sensors respectively, where the error is dominated by systematics.

## 1 Introduction

During the first long shutdown of the LHC accelerator (2013-2014), the ATLAS collaboration [1] added a fourth innermost layer to its Pixel Detector [2], called the IBL for Insertable B-Layer [3]. Prior to the IBL insertion, the Pixel Detector has been brought on surface for repairs and services upgrades, and then reinstalled in ATLAS in December 2013. The IBL package, including a new central beam pipe has been inserted in the Pixel Detector in the ATLAS cavern in May 2014.

The IBL consists of 14 azimuthal carbon fiber staves surrounding the new beam pipe at an average sensor radius of 3.3  cm. Each stave is composed of 12 double-chip modules equipped with planar silicon sensors in the central part while the outermost 4 modules on each end are equipped with single-chip 3D sensors [4]. Both sensor types are readout by FE-I4 chips [5], which have 80 columns along the beam axis and 336 rows in the \(r-\phi\) plan.

The IBL planar and 3D sensors have respectively a thickness of 200 and 230 \(\mu\)m. Both sensor types have a pixel granularity of \(\Delta\phi\times\Delta z\) of 50 \(\mu\)m\(\times\)250 \(\mu\)m. We recall that planar sensors of the other pixel layers and endcaps have a thickness of 250 \(\mu\)m and a granularity of 50 \(\mu\)m\(\times\)400 \(\mu\)m.

Front-end chips deliver a time over threshold (ToT) signal expressed in units of LHC clock cycles, which correspond to the nominal bunch crossing separation of 25  ns. ToT is the duration between the time when the measured particle induced charge goes above the fixed threshold and the time when it goes below it again, and depends on the released charge inside the sensor.

Data, services and configuration signals travel along aluminium-copper-polyimide flexes, and the cooling fluid (carbon dioxyde) circulates in titanium cooling pipes embedded in the stave structure.

## 2 Data Taking Conditions

The complete 4-layer Pixel Detector took its first data during the November-December 2014 cosmic run. In the following, "Pixel Detector" will refer to the 4-layer complete detector while "pixel layers" will refer to the old barrel pixel layers and IBL to the newly installed innermost layer.

The endcap disks were included in the data-taking but will not be discussed in this note.

Pixel layers sensors were operated at a bias voltage of 150  V, while planar and 3D IBL sensors were operated respectively at 80 and 20  V. The average temperature was 2 \({}^{\circ}\)C for pixel layers and \(-\)18 \({}^{\circ}\)C for IBL.

The Pixel Detector thresholds and time over threshold (ToT) calibration were tuned at room temperature, few weeks before the cosmic run analyzed in this note. Thresholds were set to 3500 and 2500 electrons and the Landau peak at a ToT of 30 and 10 for the pixel layers and IBL planar sensors respectively. Front-ends that read 3D sensors were calibrated to the same Landau peak position, althought their sensors are 30 \(\mu\)m thicker than planar ones. Due to the different opeation point, we expect a shift and a larger spread for both threshold and ToT scale. Results presented here are thus affected by this and should be considered as an illustration of our present understanding of the pixel layers and IBL performance, while waiting for next cosmic campaign, when the detector will be fully retuned.

Beside Pixel Detector, the two other components of the ATLAS Inner Detector took part to this campaign: the Semi Conducting Tracker (SCT) and Transition Radiation Tracker (TRT). SCT is based on siliconmicrostrip sensors and TRT on thin gaseous straw tubes giving ionisation signals for tracking and transition radiation signals used for electron identification.

## 3 Data

A TRT hits coincidence trigger selects a specific data stream of cosmic rays passing through the ATLAS Inner Detector, among all cosmic rays which have triggered the external ATLAS muon chambers. Only runs where the ATLAS solenoid magnet was on and delivering its nominal magnetic field of 2  T are considered. Approximately 1.6 M events have been recorded in the used stream.

Hits above threshold are temporarily stored in the front-end readout electronics and sent to the DAQ system if their time stamp is inside the readout window around the trigger bunch crossing (BC). This time window has been set to 5 BC's and should be reduced to one single BC when all modules will be synchronized. This ultimate timing will be reached when recording LHC proton collisions.

## 4 Track Selection

Clusters are formed from neighbouring pixel hits and their position is determined by the so-called digital clustering algorithm, estimated as the geometric center of the clusters. Clusters from Pixel Detector, SCT and TRT are then used as input to the track reconstruction algorithms. A total of about 2.2 M cosmic tracks have been reconstructed.

Due to the installation of the IBL and the re-installation of the pixel layers, some misalignment is expected. The errors on the position of the clusters have been scaled to take into account the coarse alignment available so far, so that clusters could be efficiently associated to cosmic track candidates.

Good quality tracks in the Pixel Detector acceptance have been selected by asking at least 15, 8 and 1 hit in TRT, SCT and Pixel Detector, respectively. Approximately 74 000 reconstructed cosmic tracks have passed the selection.

## 5 Cluster Properties

Good quality clusters have been selected in order to study their properties by the following criteria:

* Clusters have to be associated to a good quality track.
* Clusters from the endcap disks have been rejected: Shallow tracks from cosmics create long clusters which can be broken into several sub-clusters if a pixel has a charge below the threshold.
* For the same reason, clusters associated to tracks with a large incidence angle to the pixel module (\(\phi_{inc}\): projection of the incidence angle on \(r-\phi\) axis ) are rejected. This angle must be between -0.5 and 0.6  rad for pixel layers and IBL planar sensors and between -0.6 and 0.6  rad for IBL 3D ones. Asymetric interval has been chosen for the planar sensors because of their expected finite value for the Lorentz angle (section 6).

* Clusters closer than 1  mm to the sensor active edges are rejected as released charge can be partially lost.

These criteria selected approximately 120 000, 9 000 and 3 000 clusters in pixel layers, IBL planners and IBL 3D sensors respectively.

Figure 2 shows the cluster ToT in the pixel layers. The Landau peak is at 28 bunch crossings (BC), compatible with the expected shift due to preliminary calibration (section 2).

Figure 2 shows the cluster ToT for IBL planar and 3D sensors. The different positions of the Landau peaks are due to the different thicknesses of the two IBL sensor flavours.

Cluster size, transverse width (along \(r-\phi\), small pixel dimension) and longitudinal width (along the beam axis, large pixel dimension) are shown in Figures 4, 4 and 5, respectively.

All sensors see the same incidence spectrum, so we can compare the dimensions of their clusters. The IBL sensors show several competing effects which explain the difference with the cluster dimensions in pixel layers, and between IBL planar and 3D clusters:

* Sensor thickness: Pixel layers sensors are 250 \(\,\mu\)m thick, while IBL planar and 3D sensors are respectively 50 and 20 \(\,\mu\)m thinner. Thickness favors smaller clusters in IBL.
* Pixel dimension: Pixel dimension is the same along \(r-\phi\) (50 \(\,\mu\)m) but is smaller in \(z\) for IBL sensors (250 \(\,\mu\)m against 400 \(\,\mu\)m). Longitudinal width of IBL clusters in pixel unit are thus larger.
* Charge sharing: Charge sharing is smaller in 3D sensors for incidences close to normal, while it increases significantly at higher incidences [6].

Quantitative understanding of cluster sizes should be done with simulation, in the next study.

## 6 Lorentz Angle

In absence of magnetic field, charge carriers drift inside the silicon bulk following the electric field generated by the bias voltage which is perpendicular to sensor plane in planar sensors and parallel to it in 3D sensors.

The Inner Detector operates in a constant magnetic field of 2 \(\,\mathrm{T}\) generated by the ATLAS solenoid magnet. The path of charge carriers inside silicon sensors is bent along \(r-\phi\) direction for planar sensors, and along the anode columns for 3D sensors, where the anode columns are perpendicular to the sensor plane. The rotation under the magnetic field pushes the carriers towards neighbour pixels in \(r-\phi\) direction in planar sensors and keep them in the same pixel for 3D sensors.

This is what can be seen in Figure 6 which shows the average transverse dimension of the clusters as a function of \(\phi_{inc}\) for the three technologies. The requirement on the incidence angle described in section 5 has been relaxed to \(|\phi_{inc}|<1\,\) rad. In planar sensors, the minimal cluster width is reached when the particle incidence angle coincides with the drift angle of the charge carriers. This angle is called the Lorentz angle and is a property of the silicon bulk for a given magnetic field. We can see that pixel layers and IBL planar have their minimum in the same region, while 3D sensors are compatible with the expected zero value of the Lorentz angle.

The cluster position must be corrected for the Lorentz angle, prior to tracking algorithm. This correction is computed for each sensor as a function of its temperature. The cosmic rays, by covering a large domain of incidence angles enable us to measure the Lorentz angle by fitting the distributions of Figure 6 with [7]:

\[W=[a\times(\tan\phi_{inc}-\tan\alpha_{L})+b/\sqrt{\cos\phi_{inc}}]\otimes G( \phi_{inc}) \tag{1}\]

Where \(W\) is the average cluster transverse width, \(\phi_{inc}\) is the transverse incidence angle, \(\alpha_{L}\) is the Lorentz angle and \(G\) is the Gaussian distribution. Parameter \(a\) is proportional to the depletion depth, while \(b\) is the minimum cluster width. The geometrical formula is convoluted with a Gaussian \(G(\phi_{inc})\) to account for the finite resolution on the incidence angle \(\sigma\) which is the width of \(G(\phi_{inc})\).

Fits are shown in Figures 7, 8 and 9 for pixel layers, IBL planar and IBL 3D respectively. Fit ranges were narrowed around the Lorentz angle to get rid of the threshold effect (section 4).

Fit results are given in Table 1 with their statistical errors.

The \(a\) parameter varies as expected with the sensor thickness, while the minimal cluster size (\(b\)) is obtained for 3D sensor, confirming the small amount of charge sharing at normal incidence in this technology.

The deviation from 0 of the 3D Lorentz angle (10 \(\,\) mrad) can be considered as a fair estimation of the systematic error on the Lorentz angle. This error includes temperature difference between modules, track

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|} \hline Technology & \(a\) [pixels] & \(\alpha_{L}\) [mrad] & \(b\) [pixels] & \(\sigma\) [mrad] & \(\chi^{2}/d.o.f\) \\ \hline Pixel Layers & \(3.28\pm 0.02\) & \(201\pm 1\) & \(1.14\pm 0.01\) & \(80\pm 4\) & 64/23 \\ \hline IBL Planar & \(2.35\pm 0.06\) & \(224\pm 4\) & \(1.18\pm 0.03\) & \(112\pm 21\) & 41/23 \\ \hline IBL 3D & \(2.90\pm 0.07\) & \(-10\pm 5\) & \(1.08\pm 0.03\) & \(64\pm 20\) & 19/23 \\ \hline \end{tabular}

and cluster selection, cluster position estimation, alignment uncertainty and fit range. More statistics are needed to study separately each of these sources.

Another systematic error of 10  mrad had to be added to the error on the measured Lorentz angle in the IBL planar sensors, to account for the result variation while changing slightly the fit range. This is due to the unexpected bump observed around 100  mrad. More statistics are needed to investigate if this bump comes from specific sensors or regions of the IBL.

## 7 Conclusion

First data of the 4-layer Pixel Detector have been used to extract the cluster properties and measure the Lorentz angle. This exercise is part of the commissioning of the detector after the first long shutdown of the LHC and the IBL installation. Cluster ToT and sizes of the three technologies are qualitatively understood and a quantitative evaluation will be done with simulation and a better ToT calibration and detector tuning.

The measured Lorentz angles for the three technologies are:

\[\alpha_{L}(Pix) = 201\quad\pm 1\ \text{(stat)}\quad\pm 10\ \text{(syst)}\quad\text{mrad} \tag{2}\] \[\alpha_{L}(IBL_{Pl}) = 224\quad\pm 4\ \text{(stat)}\quad\pm 14\ \text{(syst)}\quad\text{mrad}\] (3) \[\alpha_{L}(IBL_{3D}) = -10\quad\pm 5\ \text{(stat)}\quad\pm 10\ \text{(syst)}\quad\text{mrad} \tag{4}\]

The measured angles in the two planar technologies are compatible with the expected values from measured temperature [7] within the systematic error.

Many other measurements are expected in the near future, with a tuned and calibrated detector.
