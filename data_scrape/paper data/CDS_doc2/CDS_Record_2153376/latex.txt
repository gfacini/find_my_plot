Expected performance for displaced Lepton Jets: ATLAS trigger and reconstruction efficiency in LHC 2015 run.

The ATLAS Collaboration

###### Abstract

Several models of physics beyond the Standard Model predict neutral particles that decay to final states consisting of collimated jets of light leptons and hadrons (so-called "Lepton Jets"). These particles can also have a decay length comparable to, or even larger than, the LHC detectors' linear dimensions. This note presents the 2015 ATLAS trigger and reconstruction efficiencies expected for simulated displaced Lepton Jets, based on the Falkowsky-Ruderman-Volansky-Zupan BSM Higgs decay models.

## 1 Introduction

Several possible extensions of the Standard Model (physics beyond the Standard Model, BSM) predict the existence of a hidden sector that is weakly coupled to the visible one (e.g. refs. [1; 2; 3; 4; 5; 6]). Depending on the structure of the hidden sector and its coupling to the SM, some unstable hidden states may be produced at colliders and decay back to SM particles with sizable branching fractions. If the lightest unstable hidden states have masses in the MeV to GeV range, they would decay mainly to collimated jets of leptons and possibly light mesons (Lepton Jets, LJs).

Examples of LJs production are the Falkowsky-Ruderman-Volansky-Zupan (FRVZ) models[6] where the Higgs boson decays to pairs of hidden fermions \(f_{d_{2}}\). In the first model (Figure 1, left) the hidden fermion decays to a dark photon, \(\gamma_{\rm d}\), and to a lighter hidden fermion, \(f_{d_{1}}\), the HLSP (Hidden Lightest Stable Particle). In the second model (Figure 1, right) the hidden fermion, \(f_{d_{2}}\), decays to an HLSP and a hidden scalar, \(s_{d_{1}}\), that in turn decays to pairs of dark photons. In the dark photon decays only muon/electron/pion pairs are produced [6]. Due to their small mass relative to their parent (Higgs) mass, these particles are typically produced with a large boost and, due to their weak interactions, can have non-negligible lifetime. As a result one may expect that the dark photons will decay to collimated jet-like structures containing pairs of electrons and/or muons and/or charged pions that can be produced far from the primary interaction vertex of the event (displaced LJs).

This note presents the expected performances of the ATLAS apparatus in LHC 2015 run (Run2) for the search of displaced LJ using as benchmark the FRVZ models, derived from Monte Carlo (MC) simulation.

## 2 Simulated samples

The set of parameters used to generate the signal MC samples is listed in Table 1. The Higgs boson is generated through the gluon-gluon fusion (ggF) production mechanism which is the dominant process for a low mass Higgs boson. The masses of \(f_{d_{2}}\) and \(f_{d_{1}}\) are chosen to be light relative to the Higgs boson mass, and far from the kinematic threshold at \(m_{f_{d_{1}}/HLSP}+m_{\gamma_{d}}=m_{f_{d_{2}}}\). For the chosen dark photon mass (0.4 GeV), the \(\gamma_{\rm d}\) decay branching ratios (\(BR\)) are expected to be \(45\%\)\(e^{+}e^{-}\), \(45\%\)\(\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\), \(10\%\)\(\pi^{+}\pi^{-}\)[6]. The mean lifetime \(\tau\) of the \(\gamma_{\rm d}\) (expressed throughout this paper as \(\tau\) times the speed of light \(c\)) is a free

parameter of the model. It is related to the suppression parameter \(\epsilon\) by the Eq.11:

Footnote 1: This is an approximate formula. For the complete formula see equations 4 and 5 in [http://arxiv.org/abs/0953.0363](http://arxiv.org/abs/0953.0363)

\[\gamma c\tau\ \propto\ \left(\frac{10^{-4}}{\epsilon}\right)^{2}\left(\frac{100 MeV}{m_{\gamma_{d}}}\right)^{2} \tag{1}\]

In the generated samples c\(\tau\) is chosen so that a large fraction of the decays occur inside the sensitive ATLAS detector volume, i.e. up to 7 m in radius and 13 m along the \(z\)-axis, where the muon trigger chambers are located. The detection efficiency can then be estimated for a range of \(\gamma_{\mathrm{d}}\) mean lifetimes through re-weighting of the generated samples. A second set of MC events with a scalar at high mass (800 GeV) and the same decay chain have been also simulated.

The PYTHIA8 generator [8] v8.186 is used, linked together with a custom model in MadGraph5 aMC@NLO v2.2.2 [9], for ggF production of the Higgs boson and the subsequent decay to hidden-sector particles.

The generated Monte Carlo events are processed through the full ATLAS simulation chain based on GEANT4[10; 11] and then reconstructed with the ATLAS standard software environment.

## 4 Displaced LJs reconstruction

The MC studies of the detector's response to the LJs guide the characterization of the LJs and the identification of variables useful for the selection of the signal. At the detector level, a \(\gamma_{\rm d}\) decaying to a muon pair before the MS trigger chambers is identified by two muons in the MS, while a \(\gamma_{\rm d}\) decaying to an electron/pion pair before or inside the calorimeters is seen as one jet in the calorimeters. A cluster of only muons without jets in a narrow cone is the signature of a LJ with all dark photons decaying to muon pairs (muonic LJ). A cluster of two muons and one or two jets is a typical signature of a LJ with one \(\gamma_{\rm d}\) decaying into a muon pair and one \(\gamma_{\rm d}\) decaying into an electron/pion pair. A LJ with one or two dark photons, both decaying to electron/pion pairs, results in one or more jets (calorimetric LJ).

In a search for muons from a \(\gamma_{\rm d}\) displaced decay2 muon track reconstruction using only MS information (standalone muon, SA-muons) has to be used. The Inner Detector (ID) track reconstruction in ATLAS requires at least one hit in the pixel layers and the standard muon reconstruction needs a match between the muon track in the MS and an ID track (combined muons, CB).

Footnote 2: A displaced decay is defined as a decay beyond the last pixel detector layer

Muonic LJs are reconstructed using a simple clustering algorithm that combines all the muons lying within a cone of fixed size in (\(\eta\), \(\phi\)) space. The algorithm is seeded by the highest-\(p_{\rm T}\) muon. If at least two muons and no jets are found in the cone, the LJ is accepted as \(\gamma_{\rm d}\) decaying into a muon pair. The search is then repeated with any unassociated muon until no muon seed is left.

The size of the search cone for the \(\gamma_{\rm d}\rightarrow\mu\mu\) decays is optimized based on the distribution of the opening angle \(\sqrt{(\eta_{1}-\eta_{2})^{2}+(\phi_{1}-\phi_{2})^{2}}\) between the two muons of the \(\gamma_{\rm d}\rightarrow\mu\mu\), in the MC samples of the benchmark models (see Fig.2). The cone size \(\Delta R=\sqrt{(\Delta\eta)^{2}+(\Delta\phi)^{2}}\) has been fixed to \(\Delta R\) = 0.5 that will contain all the \(\gamma_{\rm d}\) decay products. The resulting reconstruction efficiency in the ATLAS barrel (\(|\eta|\leq 0.9\)), defined as the ratio between the number of reconstructed LJs and the total number of muonic LJs in the barrel, is shown in Fig.3 as a function of the \(\gamma_{\rm d}\)\(p_{\rm T}\) and as a function of the \(\gamma_{\rm d}\) transverse decay distance Lxy in Fig.4. The increase of efficiency after the innermost MDT layer ( \(\sim 4.5\) m from the beam line) is due to the opening of the two muons in the MS magnetic field and the consequent reduction of the efficiency loss due to the overlap removal in the tracks reconstruction. The efficiency drops to zero around \(\sim 7\) m, the radial location of the barrel muon chambers. The drop in efficiency at low Lxy is due to the veto on CB muons, while the lower efficiency as function of Lxy for the 800 heavy scalar case is due to the higher boost of the LJ and therefore to the smaller separation of the two muons (see Fig.2).

The higher efficiency for the heavy scalar is due to the different lifetime used in the MC generation.

An anti-\(k_{t}\) calorimetric jet search algorithm [13; 14] with the radius parameter R = 0.4, is used to select \(\gamma_{\rm d}\) decaying into an electron or pion pair. Jets must satisfy the standard ATLAS quality selection criteria [15] with the cut \(p_{\rm T}\geq 20\) GeV. The jet energy scale correction as defined in ref. [16] is applied. For LJs decaying to an electron/pion pair we have to select only LJs with dark photons decaying in the Hadronic Calorimeter (HCAL), in order to reduce the background coming from the multi-jet production.3. The displaced decay of a \(\gamma_{\rm d}\) in the HCAL will produce a jet with very low EM fraction.4 The jets with electromagnetic (EM) fraction less than 0.08 and no muons in the cone are defined as \(\gamma_{\rm d}\) decaying into an electron or pion pair.

Footnote 3: The ATLAS Hadronic Calorimeter has a radial distance from the beam line between 2 and 4 m

Footnote 4: EM fraction is defined as the ratio of the energy deposited in the EM calorimeter to the total jet energy.

The resulting reconstruction efficiency in the ATLAS barrel, defined as the ratio between the number of reconstructed LJs and the total number of calorimetric LJs in the barrel, is shown in Fig.5 as a function of the \(\gamma_{\rm d}\)\(p_{\rm T}\) and in Fig.6 as a function of the \(\gamma_{\rm d}\) transverse decay distance Lxy. Due to the low EM fraction request, the Lxy efficiency is limited to LJ decays in the HCAL volume.

The higher efficiency for the heavy scalar is due to the different lifetime used in the MC generation.

## 5 Conclusions

In this note we have presented the expected performances of ATLAS for the detection of long lived LJs, predicted by several models of BSM physics. The hidden sector model used as benchmark is the FRVZ model where the Higgs boson can decay to the hidden sector with a final state containing LJs. The event trigger efficiency for events with displaced LJs is evaluated using the full ATLAS MC simulation chain. The same MC is used to predict the reconstruction efficiencies for \(\gamma_{\rm d}\) decaying in the barrel region of the detector.
