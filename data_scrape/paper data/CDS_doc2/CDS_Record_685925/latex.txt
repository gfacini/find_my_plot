###### Abstract

A study of the performance of the TRT to reject fake tracks within a road defined by e.g. the electromagnetic calorimeter has been done. The study was in the full rapidity range and for both low and high luminosities. Special care has been taken for the crack region where only short track segments are found in the barrel and the endcap TRT. The major pattern recognition is done using a program which is an enlargement of the since long existing code for pattern recognition in the barrel TRT. Except for the crack region the fake rates are well below the rates given in the performance specifications of the ID [1] even at the highest simulated luminosities. The performance of the TRT to reject hadronic jets has also been looked into including an evaluation of the fake track rate within jets.

## 1 Introduction

Two sources of uncorrelated tracks are important in the search for isolated leptons. The major source is the real tracks from the underlying pile up and the minor source is fake tracks from the random association of hits and track segments. While the first term is linear and irreducible the random associated hits are by nature combinatoric and much more unpredictable. Moderate variations of the background can strongly affect the fake track rate. It is therefore desirable that a negligible fake track rate is a design criteria of the ATLAS inner detector. A confirmation that the level of fake tracks from random associations is well below the rate of tracks from underlying pile up adds to the robustness of the TRT and inner detector.

## 2 The track finding algorithm

Only a short description of the track finding algorithm is given here while further details can be found in [2]. A region corresponding to the size and position of a level-2 trigger road in the electromagnetic calorimeter is cut out of the TRT with the information taken either from the KINE bank or reconstructed clusters. Thearea is formed such that all tracks down to a given p\({}_{T}\) in the trigger road can be found as shown in fig. 1 and fig. 2. A Hough transformation is carried out on the selected straws so the road is scanned for tracks in \(\varphi_{0}\) and p\({}_{T}\) where \(\varphi_{0}\) is the initial azimuth angle of the track. Track candidates are found by a cut on the fraction

\[\frac{\#\text{crossed straws with hits}}{\#\text{crossed straws}} \tag{1}\]

before a fine tuning is made on each track. The found tracks can be subjected to further cuts for reducing the amount of fakes.

Special problems arise if the road cover one of the barrel-endcap cracks since only short track segments are found in each part and often only in one of them. Only a slight difference can be seen between the real and the fake tracks before the track is found in both parts. An estimate of the prolongation of the track segment in the neighbour part is made from the longitudinal vertex constraint \(|z_{0}|<15\) cm as seen in fig. 3. A crucial part of the prolongation is the estimate of the maximum \(r\) of the track in the barrel TRT or the maximum \(z\) in the endcap, since \(\varphi(r)\) is found in the barrel part and \(\varphi(z)\) is what is needed to search for a prolongation in the endcap. The slope determined from the maximum point is the only translation between those, and this endpoint can be very hard to find in the presence of pile up.

The 2 segments are combined if hits are found which can make a track in the

The road is centered on the seed and allow all tracks within the defined road from the calorimeter and down to a minimum p\({}_{T}\) to be found. The angle shown is very exaggerated.

neighbour part, and a 3 dimensional least squares fit is made to the complete track. Those combined tracks can now be treated in the same way as the tracks passing only one part of the TRT.

## 3 Data generation and treatment

Definition of fake rates and corresponding muon and electron efficiency are the following.

**Fake track rate**: Probability to find one or more tracks in a trigger road containing only pile up. Real tracks reconstructed from the pile up are subtracted from the rate.
**Electron/muon efficiency**: Probability to find one or more tracks in a trigger road containing pile up and 1 single lepton.

The simulation of the data can be summarized as

* Panel layout used everywhere, except for the jet analysis.
* Leptons have been generated with p\({}_{T}\) of 20 GeV at \(\eta=0.35,0.86,1.80,2.0\) and 2.4 with 100 particles in each event. Those are for a given event uniformly distributed in \(\varphi\) and at fixed \(\eta\) e.g.. \(\eta=\pm 0.86\). When filling in

Figure 3: Prolongation of the track segment from barrel to endcap TRT. The radius of the track segments endpoint in the barrel is used to select the correct straws for the track search both in the \(z\)-coordinate as shown here but also in \(\varphi\) as determined from the rapidity.

100 particles in each event CPU time consumed on digitization of pile up is reduced compared to using single particles to measure the efficiency of lepton finding.
* Minimum bias generated with PYTHIA. A Poisson distribution with on the average 22 minimum bias events was used to represent a luminosity \(\mathcal{L}=10^{34}\) cm\({}^{-2}\)s\({}^{-1}\)[3].

To distinguish the real and the fake tracks several cuts were made on the track candidates. After assuring that the total length within the TRT and the reconstructed \(\eta\) are compatible with the original pointer, the main cut variables are

\[\mathrm{h/t} = \frac{\#\ hits\ in\ crossed\ straws}{total\ \#\ crossed\ straws} \tag{2}\] \[\mathrm{d/h} = \frac{\#\ hits\ within\ drift\ time\ road}{\#\ hits\ in\ crossed\ straws} \tag{3}\]

where the drift time road is defined as a 600 \(\mu\)m wide road in \(\tau\nu\) around the fitted track. This corresponds to \(2\sigma\) of the drift time resolution at zero luminosity. The drift time measurement has a resolution \(\sigma=140\)\(\mu\)m at zero luminosity and slowly rising to \(\sigma=180\)\(\mu\)m at \(\mathcal{L}=2.0\cdot 10^{34}\) cm\({}^{-2}\)s\({}^{-1}\) in the simulation. This effect has not been taken into account when defining the d/h ratio.

Only tracks with a \(\mathrm{p_{T}}>5\) GeV are used and the real tracks in the pile up have been subtracted to give the fake track rate from randomly aligned hits in the TRT. The subtraction has been done by comparing reconstructed \(\varphi_{0}\), \(\mathrm{p_{T}}\) and \(\eta\) with the KINE bank tracks in the pile up. This subtraction is important since the fake rate from real tracks in the pile up is predictable and only grows linearly with luminosity and inelastic cross section. As the fake rate from random associations is much more affected by unknown processes not taken into account in the MC it is important to show that those fakes are well below the irreducible background from tracks in the pile up.

Distributions of h/t and d/h can be seen on figures in the end of the note for the separate \(\eta\) analyzed and where the real tracks in the pile up have been subtracted. Only the maximum value of h/t and d/h have been histogrammed in a trigger road in case of more than 1 reconstructed track within the road. This makes the distributions fit together with the definition of fake track rate and efficiency above.

## 4 Fake rates in different rapidity regions

The electron efficiency is affected much more by bremsstrahlung than by requiring a good track quality, due to the material in the inner detector. Some of the 20 GeV reconstructed electron tracks fall below the 5 GeV cut-off. Some of these could eventually be recovered by the bremsstrahlung fit in the complete inner detector. However, it could be difficult since the level of real tracks in the pile up increases with lower p\({}_{T}\) and could be much larger than the level of lost electrons.

Fake rates at different rapidities and at constant electron efficiency will be a plot of the material distribution much more than a plot of the pattern recognition capabilities of the TRT. Because of this the results are quoted for a constant muon efficiency of 99% and the corresponding electron efficiency at \({\cal L}=10^{34}\) cm\({}^{-2}\)s\({}^{-1}\), are given in the table below.

In fig. 4 the efficiencies for 20 GeV electrons with reconstructed p\({}_{T}\) above 7 GeV are shown. Again the corresponding efficiency for muons is 99% but this scan over all \(\eta\) were only done at zero luminosity. The efficiency closely follows the material distribution except in the crack between barrel and endcap TRT where also the muon efficiency is very low.

A plot of the fake rate can be seen in fig. 5. The level of real tracks above 5 GeV from the pile up is indicated as a dotted line. This curve only applies to the endcap and will be a approximate 3 times higher in the barrel because of its lacking \(\eta\) measurement. Part of the rise of the curve at \(\eta=2.40\) is caused by the shift from \(r=64\) cm to \(r=50\) cm of the endcap inner radius. The \(\eta\) resolution in the TRT comes from the enter and exit points of the tracks, and in the region \(\eta=2.1\) to \(\eta=2.4\) those cannot be distinguished as seen on fig. 6. In fact these regions in the endcap TRT (\(\Delta\eta=0.6\)) are not small compared with the region lacking \(\eta\)-measurement in the barrel-TRT (\(\Delta\eta=1.3\)).

By scanning the trigger road with single particles as in fig. 7 one can see that the drop in sensitivity at the edges of the road is very sharp and the road well defined. The non-centered distribution is due to the fact that 20 GeV tracks have already curved a bit between the calorimeter, where the road is centered, and the TRT.

The crack region has a very bad efficiency of single leptons when requiring a fake rate comparable to the other regions. Only 70% of the 20 GeV muons at \(\eta=0.86\) are found in both the barrel and the endcap TRT at luminosity \({\cal L}=1.0\cdot 10^{34}\). The number given here is still partly limited by the algorithm

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|} \hline Rapidity & Efficiency electrons \\ \hline
0.35 & 95 \% \\
1.80 & 87 \% \\
2.00 & 89 \% \\
2.40 & 94 \% \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 1: Electron efficiencies at different rapidities, for a muon efficiency of 99%Figure 4: Efficiency for 20 GeV electrons with reconstructed \(p_{T}\) above 7 GeV. The effect from material in the inner detector is clearly seen. The very low efficiency at \(\eta\sim 0.8\) is totally dominated by bad reconstruction and not by the material.

used but it must be emphasized that the present design makes this region very difficult.

As seen on the distributions in the end of the note, the single leptons and the fake tracks are not very well separated even after the tracks are found in both the barrel and the endcap TRT. An improvement will most probably be needed in both design and algorithm and work on this will continue in the coming months.

## 5 Performance of the TRT inside jets

With the Coseners House design of the inner detector a sample of \(10^{6}\) jets including prompt electrons from W/Z boson and heavy quark decays have been generated with p\({}_{T}>17\) GeV and \(|\eta|<2.5\). The jets were run through the standard level-1 trigger code requiring

* Transverse energy in electromagnetic cluster above 15 GeV
* Energy in electromagnetic isolation ring below 5 GeV
* Transverse leakage energy in the hadronic calorimeter below 5 GeV
* Sum of the 2 above energies below 5 GeV

and afterwards the level-2 calorimetric cuts

* Transverse hadronic leakage in \((\Delta\eta\times\Delta\varphi)=(0.2\times 0.2)\) below 0.5 GeV
* Sum of the transverse electromagnetic energy in \((3\times 7)\) cells and preshower transverse energy in \((7\times 7)\) cells above 17 GeV

Figure 6: In the region from \(\eta=2.1\) to \(\eta=2.4\) the TRT does not provide any information on the \(\eta\) coordinate of the track. This is caused by the change in inner radius of the endcap wheels and it leads to an increased level of fake tracks.

* Isolation criteria in electromagnetic calorimeter defined as \[\frac{EM(7\times 7)-EM(3\times 5)}{EM(3\times 5)}<0.10\] where \(EM(7\times 7)\) is the total energy in \((7\times 7)\) cells. This filtering has for the level-1, and in part for the level-2 triggering been carried out at CERN by the trigger group. The fractionX1 of the original jets surviving is given in the table below in units of \(10^{-5}\) of the jet rates.

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|} \hline \(|\eta|<0.7\) & \(0.7<|\eta|<1.4\) & \(1.4<|\eta|\) \\ \hline
130 & 128 & 175 \\ \hline \end{tabular}

The track finding algorithm was run on the remaining jets with the purpose to evaluate the additional rejection power of the tracker. When requiring at least one track with a p\({}_{T}\) above 7 GeV and a track quality as described above giving 99% efficiency for muons, a major part of the remaining jets are rejected. Efficiency for electrons within the tracker can be seen in fig. 4. Also matching between the transverse energy in the calorimeter and the reconstructed p\({}_{T}\) was done but the upper limit on the \(E/p\)-match removed too many electrons because of the lack of a bremsstrahlung fit.

The summary of the results can be seen in table 2 where tracks are matched with information from the KINE bank and divided into signal electrons, background from single hadrons and background from converted photons and fake tracks.

Requiring a cut on the number of transition radiation hits takes away all the remaining hadrons and give an upper limit for this group on \(0.2\cdot 10^{-5}\) in all rapidity regions. A partner search for conversions has earlier shown to reduce the background from conversions by a factor 15 [4].

The conversion group in the table consist of the group of reconstructed tracks with no matching particle in the KINE bank. Most of those will be conversions in the tracker material but also fake tracks can be expected.

The fake track part can be evaluated from the influence of the cut on transition radiation. 90% of the conversions will survive while a much larger part of the fake tracks should be eliminated. As can be seen in the table, the cut on transition radiation hardly affects the conversion group in two of the rapidity regions so the fake tracks can only be a small fraction of all the reconstructed tracks without a matching KINE particle in those regions and an upper limit for fake tracks is \(0.2\cdot 10^{-5}\) of all the jets, or \(1.5\cdot 10^{-3}\) of the jets that passed the level-2 trigger.

An substantial amount of the tracks in the region \(0.7<|\eta|<1.4\) can be fake tracks since around 30% of the tracks here disappear with the transition radiation 

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:10]

cut. This region also covers the crack in the TRT where higher fake track rates are expected.

The total number of hits in a region \((\Delta\eta\times\Delta\varphi)=(0.2\times 0.06)\) around the pointer from the calorimeter can be compared to the number of hits in equal size regions in events containing only pile up and no tracks with \(\mathrm{p_{T}}>5\) GeV. Such an estimate gives an effective luminosity of \(\mathcal{L}_{eff}\approx 0.75\cdot 10^{34}\) cm\({}^{-2}\)s\({}^{-1}\) inside the jets in the _conversion and fake track_-column, with no \(E/p\) cut. Comparing with fig. 5 the upper limit on the fake rate within the jets of \(1.5\cdot 10^{-3}\) is in full agreement.

## 6 Conclusion

The rate of fake tracks from random associations of hits is well below the rate of tracks from the pile up in nearly the full rapidity range. This is not likely to be true in the crack region with the present design but a definite conclusion on this requires more work on the algorithms for finding and fitting tracks covering the two parts of the TRT.

To implement a Hough transformation in a level-2 trigger scheme is realistic, but only the tracks found in either the barrel or the endcap TRT can probably be used. This will bring the real and the fake tracks to almost the same level in the crack region. To use a 3 dimensional fit in the crack region on top of this to fit together 2 track segments from the barrel and the endcap is probably not simple enough to implement in the trigger.

This work has focused on the specific behavior on single track finding in the presence of pile up but the methods also proves strong on the rejection of hadronic jets. Also it has been shown that the fake rates in the jets are very low throughout most of the rapidity coverage of the TRT.

The sensitivity shows a sharp drop at the edge of the road but is shifted according to the charge of the tracks which here was a 20 GeV muon. For 5 GeV tracks the effect will be 4 times larger. Note the plot is done with a narrower trigger road than what has been used for the fake track evaluation but this only affects the width of the flat central region and neither the shift nor the edges.
