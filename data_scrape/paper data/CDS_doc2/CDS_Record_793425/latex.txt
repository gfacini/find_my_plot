Introduction

The search for new \(b\bar{b}\) resonances at the LHC will be a relevant part of the physics program (\(t\bar{t}H\to t\bar{t}b\bar{b}\), \(WH\to b\bar{b}l\nu\)). The feasibility of the measurement of the \(Z\) decay into \(b\bar{b}\) would provide an extremely powerful cross check of the detector performances for these searches. Moreover, the calibration of \(b\)-jets plays a very relevant role in the top mass measurement [1], since the precision of the knowledge of the \(b\)-jet scale is the main systematic.

In fact, due to the presence of neutrinos in \(b\) and \(c\) decays, and to the complexity of the fragmentation process, the calibration constants to be applied for \(b\)-jets differ from those used for light jets. This calls for specific calibration strategies.

\(bZ\) final states will be used with the recoling \(Z\) decaying into leptons. The transverse momentum balance of the \(b\) and the \(Z\) would provide the constants to be applied [2]. The choice of this particular channel is motivated by trigger requirements and by the purity of the \(Z\) sample that can be achieved.

The presence of a measurable \(Z\) peak in the \(b\bar{b}\) invariant mass distribution would be a powerful check for the \(b\)-jet scale calibration, if the determination of the \(Z\) parameters can be precise enough. Nevertheless, the possibility to reveal the \(Z\) peak strongly rely on the knowledge of the QCD multi-jet background and on the trigger requirements for hadronic final states. In fact, since the LVL2 present rejection against multi-jet background is modest, the LVL1 thresholds for the multi-jet triggers are foreseen to be very high. A LVL1 multi-jet rate at the level of 1-2 KHz would saturate the LVL2 bandwidth. Therefore, the LVL1 multi-jet rate must be kept at the level of few hundreds Hz [3]. The high thresholds required are not satisfactory for the measurement of the \(Z\to b\bar{b}\) channel.

To overcome the rate limitations, algorithms have being developed to perform track fitting at LVL2, whose performances are summarized in [4]. Moreover, it has been proposed recently [5] to use a hardware device inserted in the Front End electronics dedicated to the data formatting of the events selected by the LVL1 trigger, to prepare data for the LVL2 trigger. This device finds high quality tracks to be provided to the LVL2 trigger selection. These techniques would allow triggering on the impact parameter at LVL2, providing a powerful tool in selecting events with real secondary vertexes. For multi-jet events, this provides the possibility of a high LVL2 QCD rejection factor for events not containing \(b\)-jets.

In this scenario, the feasibility of the measurement of the \(Z\to b\bar{b}\) decay could be reconsidered.

A first study has been done in [5] using trigger strategies which involve the presence of a low \(P_{T}\) muon, but this can lead to systematic errors in the evaluation of the \(Z\) invariant mass because of the presence of neutrinos. In the following the first results on the feasibility of the measurement of the \(Z\to b\bar{b}\) decay are discussed. In fact, preliminary results on \(Z\to b\bar{b}\) have been obtained by the CDF experiment. For this measurement it is crucial to use the Silicon Vertex Trigger (SVT) [6], a hardware device with a similar structure to the one proposed in [5]. Although the QCD backgrounds are expected to be higher at the LHC than at the Tevatron, the higher luminosity of LHC could lead to comparable results.

## 2 Signal and Background Generation

The signal generation of \(Z\to b\bar{b}\) has been done using Pythia 6.203 [7] interfaced with ATLFAST. This has been used for the evaluation of the signal in sec. 3. The selected process for the analysis without trigger requirements is msel=11 (\(f\bar{f}\to Z\)) with ISR, FSR and underlying ([8],[9]) event included. The \({Q_{T}}^{1}\) lower threshold in the signal generation has been set to 1 GeV.

The trigger requirements will make us consider (sec. 4.2 a \(Z+j\) final state. Since the considered \(Z\) boson will have a large boost, 3M signal events have been generated using the following tree level hard processes (available in Pythia):

\[q\bar{q}\to g+\gamma^{*}/Z\qquad qg\to q+\gamma^{*}/Z \tag{1}\]

Including ISR, these processes are in principle equivalent to the \(2\to 1\) hard process (msel=11) considered above. However, this is supposed to reproduce better the event rates at high transverse momenta.

Pythia 6.203 has been used also for the QCD background (msel=1, \(Q_{T}>10\) GeV). Due to the large amount of events needed in this case to provide a significant statistics sample, the background has been generated in 9 \(Q_{T}\) bins of different width, the first one being 10-20 GeV, the last one being \(Q_{T}>720\) GeV. Approximately 30 M events were generated in each bin. A weight \(w_{i}\) has been associated to the \(i\)-th bin following the relation:

\[w_{i}=\frac{{\cal L}\sigma_{i}}{\bar{N}_{i}} \tag{2}\]

where \(\sigma_{i}\) is the cross section for the \(i\)-th bin of \(Q_{T}\), \(\bar{N}_{i}\) is the number of events generated in the bin and \({\cal L}\) (nominally the integrated luminosity) has been chosen so that the events of the first bin have \(w_{i}=1\).

The CTEQ5L parton density functions have been used both for the signal and for the background. The inclusive cross section for the signal turns out to be 9.1 nb, while

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{c|c} \hline \hline Background & Cross Section (\(\mu\)b) \\ (\(Q_{T}>10\) GeV) & \\ \hline \hline \(bb\) & 39.0 \\ \(gq\) & \(2.8\cdot 10^{3}\) \\ \(gb\) & 132 \\ \(q\bar{q}\) & 183 \\ \(gg-qq\) & \(6.3\cdot 10^{3}\) \\ \hline Total & \(9.45\cdot 10^{3}\) \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 1: _Final state partons in the \(2\to 2\) Pythia process for the generic QCD generation. The cut in \(Q_{T}\) is at 10 GeV._the predicted cross section for the background is 9.45 mb. The contributions of different subprocesses to the cross section are summarized in tab. 1.

Jets have been reconstructed with a cone algorithm of radius \(\Delta R=0.4\). The reconstruction threshold chosen for the jets is 15 GeV.

The chosen \(b\)-tagging efficiency \(\varepsilon_{b}\) is 50%. This corresponds to \(P_{T}\) dependent values for \(\varepsilon_{c}\) and \(\varepsilon_{j}\). The values for \(P_{T}=45\) GeV are \(\varepsilon_{c}=10\%\), \(\varepsilon_{j}=0.4\%\). Recent studies on full simulated Geant 3 events [10] show that these efficiencies are not optimistic.

The cross check of the Pythia predictions for the three-jet QCD final state considered in sec. 4.2 has been done with the Alpgen generator [11]. A good consistency between the two predictions has been found. This item is discussed with more details in sec. 5.

## 3 Analysis without trigger requirements

We will first perform the analysis removing any trigger requirement.

Figure. 1 shows the transverse momentum distributions for the leading (on the left) and the next to leading (on the right) jet of the event. Both are required to be \(b\)-tagged. As it can be noticed, the transverse momenta of the signal are higher than those of the background, suggesting a high cut on jet transverse momentum.

However, the expected signal to background ratio is of the order of a few permille, therefore a knowledge of the background shape at that level is needed. There is no way to reach such a precision with the MonteCarlo. The only way to extract the signal is to perform the background subtraction from the data themselves, considering a lower and a higher sideband, a la UA2 [12].

Too large \(P_{T}\) thresholds introduce a turn-on in the \(b\bar{b}\) mass distribution that can

Figure 1: _The \(P_{T}\) distribution of the two leading jets for the signal (solid distribution) and the background (dashed distribution)._

destroy the low mass side band.

Figure 2 shows the \(b\bar{b}\) invariant mass distribution for the signal (on the left) and for the background (on the right). Only jets in the tracking region are used for the selection (\(|\eta|<2.5\)). The distribution is plotted for different thresholds on the \(b\)-jets transverse momenta, and the lines denoting a \(2\sigma\) interval around the mean value of the \(Z\) peak have been added. The different curves correspond to a two jet selection with thresholds for the recalibrated offline ATLFAST jets of 20 and 15 GeV (1j20, 1j15, black curve), 25 and 15 GeV (1j25, 1j15, red curve) and 2 jets of 25 GeV (2j25, green curve). The blue curve corresponds to 25 and 15 GeV thresholds on the not recalibrated (nr) ATLFAST jets. The invariant mass distribution for the signal corresponds to the 2j25 selection, and its shape is, at this level, almost independent of the selection.

Very low \(P_{T}\) thresholds would lead to a peak in the background invariant mass distribution around 50 GeV, but the peak moves up to 70 GeV as the thresholds increase.

The first four lines of tab. 2 show the efficiency of the kinematical selection (no \(b\)-tag required on any jet) and, after the \(b\)-jet identification, after the cut on the invariant mass window 80 GeV \(<M_{inv}<\) 100 GeV, together with the significance obtainable for 10 fb\({}^{-1}\) of integrated luminosity collected.

Extremely high significances (larger than 85) can be reached, with signal to background ratios of about 1/300. We make the following remarks:

* The jet thresholds considered here are unrealistic, because ATLFAST overestimate the reconstruction efficiency of low \(E_{T}\) jets with respect to the full simulation estimation and because trigger requirements will force the thresholds to be raised a lot. It is impossible to trigger on the considered final states with only a trigger on jets.

Figure 2: _On the left: \(b\bar{b}\) invariant mass distribution for the signal for a 2j25 (two \(b\) jet with \(P_{T}>25\) GeV). On the right: \(b\bar{b}\) invariant mass distribution for the background for different kinematical selections on the two \(b\)–jets. The lines denoting a \(2\sigma\) window on the signal have been added._

* Nevertheless, the results of tab. 2 show that the cross section for the \(Z\) production is high enough to give a very strong statistical significance. There is large room to raise the thresholds.
* Already with the lj25,lj15 (nr) selection, the turn-on on the background invariant mass distribution is within the \(2\sigma\) window of the \(Z\) peak.

Given the size of the signal to background ratio, the third point is critical. A strategy to raise the thresholds while not increasing the background invariant mass turn-on is needed.

A possible strategy is the following: in addition to 2 soft jets a third more energetic (leading) jet is required in the event. A threshold of 80 GeV on the transverse momentum of the leading jet has been set (the selection is lj80,2j25). We also apply a \(b\)-jet veto for the leading jet. This leads to the selection of QCD events in which the \(b\)-jets produced by a 2\(\rightarrow\)2 direct production process are suppressed. Most of the accepted \(b\)-jet pairs in

\begin{table}

the selected QCD events are produced by gluon splitting. This process gives lower \(b\bar{b}\) pair invariant masses. Figure 4 shows the \(\Delta R=\sqrt{\Delta\eta^{2}+\Delta\phi^{2}}\) separation between the two \(b\)-jets for QCD events. Two contributions can be seen in both the distributions of fig. 4: the peak at \(\pi\) is produced by the direct \(b\bar{b}\) production in the \(2\to 2\) hard scattering, the other (at lower values of \(\Delta R\)) is due mainly to gluon splitting events. As expected, the presence of the leading jet forces the two \(b\) jet to be angularly closer than in the 2 jet selection. Therefore, the invariant mass distribution for the background peaks at lower values than in the 2 jet case (fig. 5). In fact the background is well shaped down to (at least) 40 GeV. The plot of fig. 3 shows the \(P_{T}\) distribution for the leading and next to leading \(b\)-jet for the signal events.

Moreover, the raise of the cuts on the \(P_{T}\) of the two \(b\)-jet leads to further improvement in the results. We consider a selection with \(P_{T}^{b}>30\) GeV. While the peak of the QCD \(b\bar{b}\) invariant mass is not significantly shifted by the increase of the thresholds, the low tail in the signal mass distribution is less populated and the \(S/\sqrt{B}\) and \(S/B\) ratios are improved. The \(b\bar{b}\) invariant mass distributions for the signal and the background are shown in fig. 6.

The shape of the signal \(b\bar{b}\) distribution changes as well. Due to the selection of boosted \(Z\), the energy inside the jet cones is expected to be higher, therefore, less radiative tails are expected as the cuts on the \(P_{T}\) of the jets increase. Fig. 7 (on the right) shows the comparison between the \(Z\) invariant mass distributions of three selections (1j40 2j25, 1j80 2j25, 1j80 2j30). The peak for the hardest selection is narrower.

Figure 4: _On the left: \(\Delta R\) distance between the two \(b\)–jets for the 2j25 sample (solid line) and 1j80, 2j25 (dashed line) selection._

## 4 Analysis with Trigger Requirements

The trigger requirements on the analysis have to be taken into account. Since the presence of the neutrino from the \(b\)-decay would lead to large tails for the \(Z\) peak, and since the fraction of accepted events would be low, the use of the muon trigger (which has been considered already elsewhere [5]) has to be avoided. Therefore, the multi-jet trigger has to be considered. The official multi-jet trigger thresholds of ATLAS are too high. The three jet trigger has a threshold of 90 GeV at LVL1 on the jet \(P_{T}\), which becomes 165 GeV at the High Level Trigger. The use of those thresholds would imply not to see the signal.

In the hypothesis of additional rejection available at LVL2 thanks to \(b\)-tagging, one could consider the possibility of lowering the LVL1 thresholds, thus allowing a more efficient trigger for the \(Z\to b\bar{b}\) decay.

### Performance of the LVL1 Multi-jet Trigger

We are interested in jet trigger configurations with thresholds much lower than those foreseen by the standard menu. The usefulness of the jet trigger for the study of hadronic Higgs final states (and, thus, for the purposes of this work) relies on its efficiency for the identification of low \(E_{T}\) jets and on the foreseen rates for such final states. In particular, we will consider the possibility of triggering on one or two hard (\(E_{T}\simeq 100\) GeV) jets and identify low \(E_{T}\) RoI corresponding to soft jets (\(E_{T}\simeq 30-40\) GeV).

The strategy for the trigger is to use the hard jets to trigger at LVL1, then use the online \(b\)-tagging to reduce the rate at LVL2. In order to do that the LVL1 has to be able to identify not only the hard jets, but also the two soft jets, in order to provide to the LVL2 the necessary RoIs to perform the \(b\)-tagging algorithm. Therefore, the performances of the LVL1 have to be studied with respect to:

* The efficiency of the identification of soft jets as RoI.
* The rate foreseen for lowered single and di-jet thresholds.
* The LVL1 turn-on thresholds, _i.e._, what is the offline energy for which a given LVL1 threshold is fully efficient.
* The number of RoI per event at low threshold due to noise and pileup. This is a fundamental parameter for the further LVL2 processing. Since only the detector data coming from the RoIs are considered at LVL2, its latency is determined by the number of RoIs identified by the LVL1.

The results on the trigger performances have to be considered as preliminary. In fact, each preprocessor module can apply one calibration constant to the energy measured in its

Figure 6: _The \(b\bar{b}\) invariant mass distribution for the signal (on the left) and the background (on the right). Both the distributions have been obtained with the 1j80 2j30 selection._calorimeter slice. Therefore, because of the layout of the preprocessor modules, different constants could be applied to the EM and HAD calorimeters, allowing for a rough jet calibration. The software used for the LVL1 simulation [13] does not have any calibration constant applied. With respect to that, the present results are thus conservative than those obtainable in ATLAS.

Moreover, the noise simulation of the calorimeters is not completely correct. The preliminary available software estimates the noise in the trigger channels from the digital readout of the calorimeters, instead of performing the analog sum of the signals in the projective towers and apply the adequate energy smearing due to the electronic trigger digitization channel. This can slightly (10-20%) change the rate estimations in the single jet channel [14].

The study of the performances of the trigger has been done considering a sample of QCD events (\(Q_{T}>17\) GeV) passed through a detailed detector simulation performed with Geant 3 (Data Challenge 1). Initial and final state radiation, underlying event and electronic noise have been included in the simulation. We will discuss the effect of pile-up at low luminosity (\(2\cdot 10^{33}\) cm\({}^{-2}\) s\({}^{-1}\)) later in this section. The reference jets have been defined as those jets originated from the MonteCarlo tracks (KINE tracks) and analyzed using the offline reconstruction algorithm. A cone algorithm (\(\Delta R=0.4\), \(E_{seed}=2\) GeV) has been used to reconstruct them.

The LVL1 jets considered have been obtained with a \(0.8\times 0.8\) sliding window. The lowest threshold considered is 5 GeV.

Each reference jet is matched to the angularly closest LVL1 jet. If the same LVL1 jet is a candidate to be assigned to more than one reference jet, it is assigned to the closest one.

The efficiency (defined as the number of matched reference jets) for the LVL1 identification of a soft jet as a function of its transverse energy and pseudorapidity is shown

Figure 7: _Invariant mass comparison between the three jet selection discussed in the text._

in fig. 8 (on the left). The threshold considered for the LVL1 jets is 5 GeV. While the identification of a jet with \(E_{T}<30\) GeV is 60% efficient, the identification efficiency for a 40 GeV jet is larger than 90% over the whole pseudorapity region, with some border effect around \(|\eta|=3\). The average of the LVL1 efficiency within \(|\eta|<2.5\) is shown in the right plot of fig. 8. The black curve refers to the 5 GeV threshold on the LVL1 jets, the red one to a 10 GeV threshold, the blue one to 15 GeV. A 40 GeV jet is still identified with high efficiency (\(\epsilon\simeq 90\%\)) if the LVL1 threshold is set to 10 GeV, but the efficiency drops to 60% if the threshold is 15 GeV.

We evaluate the rate for two possible trigger configurations. The final states that we will consider later involve the presence of one or two hard jets. The trigger rates expected (at \({\cal L}=2\cdot 10^{33}\) cm\({}^{-2}\) s\({}^{-1}\)) for a single and di-jet triggers are shown in fig. 9 as a function of the LVL1 threshold applied. In order to obtain reasonable trigger rates for the single jet case, one has to consider high LVL1 thresholds for the identification of the hard jet. The rate foreseen (for example) with a hard threshold of 70 GeV is 40 KHz, which has to be reduced down to few KHz to match the ATLAS requirements. For the same set of thresholds, the di-jet case is a factor 5-6 smaller.

To optimize the hard thresholds to apply, the relation between the reference jet energy and the threshold necessary to be efficient at that energy is needed. In order to obtain this, the LVL1 \(E_{T}\) distributions corresponding to reference jets within narrow bins of transverse energy have been considered. A LVL1 threshold has been then set so that 95% of the events are kept. Fig. 10 shows the threshold to be set at LVL1 to be 95% efficient in jet identification as a function of the reference \(E_{T}\). As already discussed, the efficiency curve should improve once the calibration constants for the preprocessors will be included.

The above information allows an updated LVL1 trigger menu. A final state with two

Figure 8: _On the left: the efficiency of the LVL1 jet reconstruction as a function of the reference jet energy and pseudorapidity for a LVL1 threshold of 5 GeV. On the right: the mean efficiency in the \(|\eta|<2.5\) region is shown for three different LVL1 thresholds._

reference jets of \(E_{T}=135\) GeV, for example, can be efficiently triggered with a LVL1 menu of 2j75 (from fig. 10). A soft jet of 40 GeV will be identified as a RoI with high efficiency with a LVL1 threshold of 10 GeV (fig. 8). The rate foreseen for such a final state is around 10 KHz (fig. 9 on the right).

Even at low luminosity, the pileup could play an important role in the determination of the LVL1 rates for multi-jet final states. It has been simulated by adding to the QCD events an average number of 5 minimum bias events (with a poissonian distribution), corresponding to the expected pileup for \({\cal L}=2\cdot 10^{33}\) cm\({}^{-2}\) s\({}^{-1}\). It has been verified that the performances for the identification of soft and hard jets do not change significantly in presence of pileup.

The foreseen rates change, instead, at low \(E_{T}\). Figure 11 shows the same of fig. 9 in presence of pileup. In the single jet case for low values of the threshold, the increase of the rate is 10-15%, while the contribution of the pileup is negligible if thresholds above 100 GeV are considered. The effect at low \(E_{T}\) is less important for the di-jet case. If the threshold is 65 GeV, the pileup increases the rate by about 10%, but the effect is already negligible if a threshold at 85 GeV is considered. Therefore, as expected the low \(E_{T}\) region is more sensitive to the pileup than the hard \(E_{T}\) region.

We consider also the possibility of a reduction of the geometrical acceptance of the LVL1 system. Since the \(b\)-tagging can be performed only on jets with \(|\eta|<2.5\) (corresponding to the acceptance of the ATLAS inner tracker), if one is interested in \(b\)-jets, the events with jets traveling at higher pseudorapidity can be rejected already at the LVL1. This can be obtained considering the \(\eta\) coverage and excluding the informations from the LVL1 modules which cover the regions excluded from the \(b\)-jet selection. We therefore limit the acceptance of the LVL1 trigger at \(|\eta|<2.5\), thus requiring all the jets to be in the central region of the detector. The corresponding rate curves are shown in fig. 12 (on the left). As it can be seen, the rate reduction is at the level of 5-10% for the single jet,

Figure 9: _Output rate for the LVL1 foreseen for a trigger menu involving a single jet (black dots) or two jets as a function of the LVL1 threshold._

more important (\(\simeq 15\%\)) for the di-jet case. The number of RoI obtained in the case of reduced geometry with a threshold of 10 GeV is shown in fig. 11 on the right for the di-jet trigger. The mean number of RoI is 4.2, which is low with respect to those expected for the electron and muon triggers [3].

Figure 13 shows a comparison between the three considered cases (full geometrical acceptance and no pileup, full geometrical acceptance with pileup, reduced geometrical acceptance with pileup). The reduced geometry compensates the effect of the pileup in the single jet case, while the rate is significantly reduced in the di-jet case.

### Results

We apply the results found in the previous section to the \(Z\to b\bar{b}\) case. We focus on the LVL1 rate for events with one hard jet (\(P_{T}^{LVL1}\) = 100-200 GeV).

The corresponding rates (with the trigger accepting jets in the \(|\eta|<2.5\) pseudorapidity region) are summarized in fig. 12, while the performances for the identification of RoIs corresponding to the soft jets are summarized in fig. 10. If one wants to be full efficient on \(P_{T}=40\) GeV jets, the corresponding LVL1 threshold for those jets has to be set at about 10 GeV (in order to be 95% efficient), while the LVL1 threshold can be increased at 15 GeV if one wants to be efficient on 50 GeV jets. To obtain a reasonable rate (we choose 5 KHz as the maximum LVL1 rate allowed, which is half of the rate foreseen for the single electron trigger), the threshold for the high \(P_{T}\) jet should be set at about 120 GeV. This means that trigger requirements impose a cut on the \(P_{T}\) of the leading jet at about 190 GeV (fig. 10).

The LVL1 threshold that we choose for the single jet trigger is 120 GeV, while we choose a LVL1 threshold of 10 GeV for the identification of the RoIs, the former being efficient (at 95%) on a jet with \(P_{T}=190\) GeV, the latter on 40 GeV jets.

At LVL2, the rate is reduced for two reasons:

Figure 10: _The plot shows the threshold to be set at the LVL1 to be 95% efficient in the jet identification as a function of the reference jet transverse energy._

* The better calorimeter granularity that can be considered and the larger number of calibration factors that can be applied (together with the fact that they can be cell energy or jet energy dependent) improve the jet calibration. From previous studies [15], this reduces the jet rate by a factor which is jet energy dependent, but it is always about a factor 2.
* The application of \(b\)-tagging.

Let us discuss the second issue. The performances of the online \(b\)-tagging as it is implemented in the software framework of the LVL2 are summarized in tab. 3[4]. The first line of the two pseudorapidity regions refers to a \(b\)-tagging efficiency \(\varepsilon_{b}=60\%\), therefore they are pessimistic with respect to our analysis (where \(\varepsilon_{b}=50\%\)). If \(\varepsilon_{j}=20\%\) (R=5) is assumed, the total rejection we obtain (thanks to the \(b\)-tagging) is about 25 (two \(b\)-jets). Therefore, we can expect a total LVL2 rejection is about 50, which make us evaluate the output rate for this channel at 100 Hz (the total output rate for the LVL2 trigger is 1 KHz). This rate could already be acceptable.

On the other hand, the use of hardware linear track fitting with a hardware device a la SVT [5] could provide a rejection very close to the offline. In the following a lower and a upper limit on the LVL2 output rate will be shown. The first one comes from the pessimistic assumption on the official "software" rejections against non-\(b\) jets (tab. 3), the second one comes from the (optimistic) assumption of offline performances already at LVL2.

We do not discuss here the performances (in terms of latency and CPU power) that are required at LVL2 in order to trigger on such events once accepted by the LVL1. These point has to be clarified elsewhere, with a careful analysis of the LVL2 prospects for jet triggers and \(b\)-tagging.

Based on the previous discussion, we therefore apply the following selection:

* The leading jet is required to be non-\(b\) tagged.

Figure 11: _The same of fig. 9, but with low luminosity pileup added._

* It is required to have \(P_{T}>190\) GeV and \(|\eta|<2.5\).
* At least two \(b\)-tagged jets (therefore with \(|\eta|<2.5\)) are required.
* Their \(P_{T}\) has to be larger than 40 GeV.
* The two \(b\) jets (the two leading \(b\) jets, if more than two are present) are used to build the invariant mass distribution.

The corresponding invariant mass distributions for the signal (on the left) and for the background (on the right) are shown in fig. 14.

The background is well shaped down to 50 GeV. Given the low statistics generated both for the background and the signal, much lower than the number of events expected for 30 fb\({}^{-1}\) of integrated luminosity (a factor 20 for the signal, \(10^{5}\) for the background), the relative fluctuations are much larger than those that will be obtained with data. We therefore parametrized both the signal and background shape. The background is parametrized by the exponential function shown in fig. 14, while we used two gaussians to parametrize the signal (one to take into account the core of the distribution, the second

one to account for the radiative tails). Then, two histograms have been filled with the full statistics expected for 30 fb\({}^{-1}\) and summed up together. The resulting histogram is shown in fig. 15. It has been fitted again first with one single exponential function and then with the sum of an exponential and a gaussian. The resulting \(\chi^{2}\) is much better for the latter than for the former (0.8 against 19.7). Moreover, the lower sideband is large enough to safely perform the background subtraction.

We underline that the described procedure do not depend on the particular shape of the background that have been chosen (the exponential, since it fits the generated low statistics sample). The only requirement is that the background can be described by an analytical function. It has been checked that with arbitrary parametrized background shapes (filled with the correct statistics) the signal is always well visible. This has been done letting one physicist (A) to generate arbitrary monotone decreasing function, and one other (physicist B) to analyze the distributions in a blind way (see Appendix A).

The final results are summarized in tab. 4. The signal to background ratio is lager than that estimated in the previous sections, while the statistical significance is lower. Nevertheless, if 30 fb\({}^{-1}\) are considered, it is high enough to be still significant also in the case that the background level is twice that considered here.

Final Remarks on the Background Generation

The QCD background used so far has been generated using Pythia, which is a Parton Shower MonteCarlo. For sake of completeness, the results obtained with Pythia have been cross checked using a Matrix Element generator. In fact, as already discussed, while Pythia generates all the possible \(2\to 2\) QCD processes and additional jets are given from initial and final state radiation, the use of the Matrix Element generates directly \(2\to 3\) process followed by showering effects. The final state in this analysis consists of three jets, thus the ME should provide a more reliable estimation of the background. On the other hand, the events selection accepts events where the two \(b\)-jets mostly come from the splitting of one gluon of the \(2\to 2\)\(gg\to gg\) process. In this case, logarithmically enhanced contributions could play an important role. It is well know that they are better reproduced by a parton shower MonteCarlo than by a ME. It is therefore important to cross check the background estimation with a ME MonteCarlo. This comparison should also give an extremely rough estimation of the systematic uncertainty involved in the background prediction.

Nearly 3M background events have been generated with the Alpgen generator [11]. The selected final state is \(bbj\). A cut at 5 GeV has been introduced at parton level on the final state parton. The predicted cross section is 14.5 \(\mu\)b. The events have been then hadronized with Pythia and reconstructed using ATLFAST.

As shown in fig. 16 on the left (the number of true \(b\)-jets among the three reconstructed jets considered in the analysis; the plot has been obtained with Pythia), the process generated with Alpgen should include about 85% of the total background.

The selection described in the previous sections has been applied to these events. The results are summarized in tab. 5. A comparison with the Pythia results shows a good agreement. The right plot of fig. 16 shows that also the background invariant mass

distribution does not change significantly compared to the Pythia prediction (fig. 14 on the left).

## 6 Conclusions

The final jet (and \(b\)-jet) calibration will be done with physics data. The most likely candidate channel to provide the corrections is the \(P_{T}\) balance in \(Z+j\to l^{+}l^{-}j\) channel. This will cover a jet \(P_{T}\) range from 40 GeV up to about 500 GeV. The use of this channel for \(b\)-jet calibration suffers from low statistics and from the background due to misidentified \(c\) and light jets. Therefore, the measure of the \(Z\to b\bar{b}\) decay is useful to cross check the \(b\)-jet calibration. Because of the huge rate from QCD hard scattering events, such a channel is hard to trigger. However, the signal can be triggered and extracted from the background if a configuration with a hard jet recoiling against the \(Z\) is considered, and a selection on \(b\)-jets at LVL2 is available.

## Appendix A

We show in the following that the peak obtained with the selection described in the text can be extracted over extremely different backgrounds: in a blind analysis it is found over the background each time it is present, while it is not erroneously reconstructed when it is not present in the spectrum.

We also show that the precision of the peak parameters measurement is good. In particular, the uncertainties on the mean value of the peak are within 1% when different background shapes and fitting functions are used.

Several background shapes have been generated using different analytical functions. The signal distribution in \(M_{b\bar{b}}\) has been generated parameterizing the histogram in fig. 14 (left) with the sum of 2 gaussians, the first one to take into account the core of the distribution, the second one for the radiative tails. The statistical fluctuations are generated (both for the signal and for the background) accordingly to a statistical sample of 30 fb\({}^{-1}\).

We used simple analytical functions to parametrize the background instead of simulating shower MonteCarlo events because the high QCD cross section would require the generation of many millions events to obtain a QCD shape that would be extremely uncertain.

Different samples have been generated and independently analyzed with no knowledge of the used functions. The analytical expressions for the background has been chosen so that the distribution decreases in the \(M_{b\bar{b}}>50\) GeV region, and the amount of background in the signal region is comparable with what is expected from QCD simulation.

For the signal analysis these steps where performed for all histograms:

* the side bands outside a signal window are fit with different functions to find a shape reproducing accurately the background;
* in each bin of the histogram, the function obtained by the side-band fit is subtracted and the deviation from the fit is shown in a new histogram (residual-plot: see the right-top and the left-bottom plot in each figure in the following);
* the residual-plot is fit again using a gaussian shape;

The first background distribution has been generated accordingly to the following parametrization:

\[\frac{dN}{dM_{b\bar{b}}}\Delta M_{b\bar{b}}=\frac{a}{M_{b\bar{b}}^{4}} \tag{3}\]

where the parameter \(a\) has been chosen to correctly normalize the background in the signal region.

Figure 17 shows the result of the analysis. The considered signal region is \(62\;\mathrm{GeV}-116\) GeV, and it has been excluded from the fit of the background. The regions between 50 and 62 GeV and above 116 GeV are used as sideband intervals. The background shape has been fitted successfully with the following expression:

\[f_{1}(M_{b\bar{b}})=p_{1}(x-p_{2})^{p_{3}} \tag{4}\]The top-left plot shows the result of the fit in the sidebands, while the top right plot shows the residual in the sidebands after the background subtraction. As can be seen both from the \(\chi^{2}\) value of the fit and from the residual distribution, the chosen function fits well the sideband regions. The bottom-left plot shows the entire histogram after the background subtraction, superimposed to the expected distribution for the signal. Although the background distribution is not perfect in the tails (we must note that this background is particularly bad, since it fall down a factor \(\simeq 100\) inside the peak window), the signal peak is clearly visible above the background. A gaussian fit of the histogram (bottom-right plot) provides a mean of the gaussian of 90.3 GeV.

A second test has been done considering a different generating function for the background:

\[\frac{dN}{dM_{b\bar{b}}}\Delta M_{b\bar{b}}=a\sqrt{\frac{1}{M_{b\bar{b}}^{5}}+ \frac{2.7\cdot 10^{5}}{M_{b\bar{b}}^{3}}}\ (M_{b\bar{b}}\ \mbox{in GeV}) \tag{5}\]

where, again, the parameter \(a\) has been chosen to obtain the correct normalization in the signal region. The fit has been performed with the same function used in the previous case (eq. 4). The same sidebands have been also considered. Figure 18 shows the results of the fit, the residuals after the background subtraction, the gaussian fit of the resulting peak, as in the previous case. We notice that the difference of the mean value of the gaussian with respect to the previous case is less than 1%.

A third test has been done using again the same fitting function, but with a different generating function for the background:

\[\frac{dN}{dM_{b\bar{b}}}\Delta M_{b\bar{b}}=a\left(\frac{1}{M_{b\bar{b}}^{3}} +\frac{130}{M_{b\bar{b}}^{1.5}}\right)\ (M_{b\bar{b}}\ \mbox{in GeV}) \tag{6}\]

Also in this case, the difference of the mean value of the gaussian fit of the peak is within 1% from the previously obtained values, as shown in fig. 19.

Further tests has been done on the background shape of eq. 6. The aim was to cross check the dependence of the mean value of the gaussian fit on the fitting function used for the background subtraction. Thus, the following fitting function has been considered:

\[f_{2}(M_{b\bar{b}})=p_{0}+p_{1}*\arctan(p_{2}+p_{3}(M_{b\bar{b}}-p_{4})^{p_{5}}) \tag{7}\]

The results are shown in fig. 20. The chosen function fits well the sidebands (as shown in the top-left plots) and causes only a slight (within 1%) variation of the mean value of the gaussian fit of the peak. We repeated the test keeping the same background generated shape and changing again the fitting function, as:

\[f_{3}(M_{b\bar{b}})=p_{0}+(M_{b\bar{b}}-p_{4})^{p_{1}}\exp(p_{2}+p_{3}(M_{b \bar{b}}-p_{4})^{p_{5}})(p_{8}\log^{p_{7}}\left(\frac{M_{b\bar{b}}-p_{4}}{p_{ 6}}\right)+p_{9}) \tag{8}\]

Also in this case, the peak position resulting from the background subtraction is within 1% with respect to the previous values (fig. 21).

Finally, we consider the case where no signal is present superimposed to the background histogram. This test to verify if a fake signal could show up due to the sidebands fitting procedure. In this case, the considered background shape is:

\[\frac{dN}{dM_{b\bar{b}}}\Delta M_{b\bar{b}}=aM_{b\bar{b}}^{-1.23}M_{b\bar{b}}\ \mbox{in GeV}) \tag{9}\]

The fit done with \(f_{1}\) (eq. 4) reproduces well the behaviour of the sidebands (fig. 22 top-left and top-right). The subtraction of the background in the full histogram range (fig. 22 bottom-left) results in no evidence for the signal (the expected signal is also reported as well). As a consequence, the usual final gaussian fit produces no evidence for the signal.

Although far from being complete, the tests reported here show that despite the low expected signal to background ratio (\(\simeq 3\%\)), the signal can be extracted from the background with the background subtracted directly from the data. The mean value of the gaussian fit after the background subtraction is stable. The maximum fluctuation found changing significantly both the background shapes and the fitting functions is, in fact, within \(1\%\).
