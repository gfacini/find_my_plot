Introduction

X-ray tomography was proposed to check sense wire position inside MDT chambers of ATLAS muon spectrometer /1,2/. The proposal is based on the JINR group work /1/, utilizing "passive" mode, and research of S.-Peterburg group /2/ in framework of RD-6, where "active" mode was shown.

Some years ago in our laboratory pulsed X-ray source was used for test of large drift chambers /3/. The source was used for measurements of x(t)-relations. But field-shaping wires shadows were also seen and it was pointed out that such effect could be used to measure a wire position inside chamber. Now we try to adjust our X-ray source for wire position measurements.

In previous investigations with X-ray we used wide beam about 1 mm width. It is not acceptable to thin (about 50 \(\mu\)m) wire position measurements. For this goal the width of beam have to be about wire diameter or less. So, the first task of our work was a creation of the narrow X-ray beam. We can do such beam and below is the first results of research.

## 2 Setup

The description of X-ray source is given in /3/. It works in pulsed mode. The minimal duration of pulse is 15 ns. The frequency and maximal duration of pulse are limited only by the heating of tube. In principle it can work in continuous mode. The admitted anode voltage is 45 kV, but we were limited by our HV power supply ( 20-25 kV ). The X-ray tube is driven by positive polarity pulses with amplitude 100 V.

In fig. 1 it is shown schematically the cross-section of our setup. The X-ray tube is closed in metallic box. In the picture it is shown only the position of X-ray spot at the anode of the tube. The size of spot is \(75^{+78}\mu\)m, as it is claimed by manufacturer. The beam is created by collimator, consisting of two polished steel plates, the distance between which is 50 \(\mu\)m and length of plates in beam direction is 70 mm. The drift chamber with four sense wires/4/ was used for detection of X-ray. The chamber is closed in round stainless steel tube with wall thickness 2 mm. Length of chamber is 6 m. The X-ray entered in chamber through the special window, glued by polyethylene films about 100 \(\mu\)m thickness. The window occupies about one quarter of tube cycle and 10 mm along chamber wires. Chamber is filled with Ar+10%CO\({}_{2}\) mixture at atmospheric pressure. The X-ray in drift chamber is measured by normalized counting rate, which is a relation of number of sense wire signals to number of X-ray pulses. The X-ray source box with collimator is placed on movable platform, which can be moved in direction perpendicular to drift chamber wires.

## 3 Shadow of field-shaping wire

At the first step of investigation we tried to see the field-shaping wires in the drift chamber, which are made of 100 \(\mu\)m diameter stainless steel. When beam is moved across chamber, counting rate of the drift chamber sense wires will decrease if the X-ray beam is in front of field-shaping wire. The example of such dependence is shown in fig. 2, where the normalized counting rate for 4 sense wires is presented versus relative X-ray beam coordinate. The full and dashed lines in the fig. 2 correspond to two directions of the beam movement across the chamber. The field-shaping wire shadow is clearly seen. The difference of counting rates of wires is caused by X-ray attenuation inside chamber and sense wires staggering. The full width at half of counting rate fall is about 100 \(\mu\)m. The value is equal to wire diameter. So, we could conclude that we have the narrow X-ray beam with width less than 100 \(\mu\)m.

## 4 Measurement of wire position of special test mesh

To estimate the X-ray tomography precision scan of special wire mesh was done. The mesh was placed between collimator and the drift chamber, as it is shown in fig.1. Different thickness plates could be placed between the mesh and collimator to test an influence of material.

It was tested two meshes. Both meshes consisted of 6 parallel wires with step about 1 mm. Their diameters and materials are given in table 1.

The examples of scan results are presented in fig.3, where the normalized counting rate of the 1st sense wire of the drift chamber is plotted as a function of relative beam position. The Al foil thickness in front of mesh is indicated in right upper corner of each graph. The fig.3a-3c correspond to test wire mesh Nr. 1, fig.3d corresponds to mesh Nr. 2. The duration of X-ray pulse was 8 \(\mu\)s. The anode X-tube voltage was 18 kV for fig.3a and 3b; 19.5 kV for fig.3c and 25 kV for fig.3d. Number of X-ray pulses for each point was 1000 (fig.3a), 3000 (fig.3b,c) and 4000 (fig.3d).

It is seen 7 falls of counting rate which correspond to position of 6 test mesh wires and one field-shaping wire inside the drift chamber. The fall due to the field-shaping wire is the widest one and in fig.3a and 3c it is superimposed with fall due to wire of the test mesh.

To measure the wire coordinate from scan results, shown in fig. 3, "background" counting rate was subtracted and instead of falls of counting rate the picks were obtained, which were fitted by gaussian distribution. The picks are shown in fig. 4 (they correspond to fig. 3a) and in fig. 5 ( they correspond to fig. 3c ). Mean value of the gaussian fit was taken as a coordinate of the test mesh wire. The error of the fit mean value is less than 1 \(\mu\)m for 0 and 0.21 mm Al, 3-8 \(\mu\)m for 0.42 mm Al and 10-25 \(\mu\)m for 1 mm Al in front of mesh. Sigma of the gaussian fit is about 26 \(\mu\)m and it is possible to distinguish wires at distance between them about 90 \(\mu\)m ( fig3c, fig5 ). It is seen that 25 \(\mu\)m W wires are also detected up to 1 mm Al in front of mesh.

It was performed 6 measurements of the test mesh No.2. They were done with intervals from one to three days with Al foil 1 mm in front of mesh ( measurements No.2 and 6 ) or without Al foil. Then the relative coordinate of wires were measured by microscope with precision less than 5 \(\mu\)m.

The relative coordinates of test mesh wires with respect of the 1st one are given in table 2 for optical and X-ray measurements. Their difference is also presented in the table. The difference means value \((\mathrm{X_{i}\text{-}X_{1}})_{X-ray}\) - \((\mathrm{X_{i}\text{-}X_{1}})_{optic}\), where i is a number of test mesh wire. The mean value and RMS for X-ray measurements are presented in table 3. The RMS is 7-12 \(\mu\)m. The mean difference between X-ray and optical measurements for relative wire coordinate is changed from -16 to 28 \(\mu\)m with RMS from 7 to 13.5 \(\mu\)m ( table. 4 ). We believe that such errors are caused by an imperfection of our system for X-ray source movement.

The difference between X-ray and optical measurements of relative test mesh wires coordinate is plotted in fig.6. The fig.6 is simple graph of results from tables 2 and 4.

## 5 Conclusion

1. We have the narrow X-ray beam with width ( sigma ) 26 \(\mu\)m and divergency 7\(\times\)10\({}^{-4}\).
2. Our X-ray source can be used to measure coordinate of the tungsten 25 \(\mu\)m and stainless steel 45 \(\mu\)m wires when there is 1 mm of Al in front of wire.
3. Difference between optical and X-ray measurements of wire coordinates is less than 30 \(\mu\)m.
4. There are possibilities of increasing of the material thickness in front of wires due to increasing the beam intensity with increasing of X-tube anode voltage or duration of pulse.
5. We believe that 10 \(\mu\)m precision can be reached with such technic for 50 \(\mu\) W wires when 1.5-2 mm Al is placed in front of wires.
6. The measurement time for one wire was limited by the platform speed. For example, to measure wire profile as it seen in fig.4 and 5, it needs about 10 points. For 3000 pulses per point and frequency 500 Hz it will be need 1 minute plus time of platform moving.
7. The automatic movable table and rigid setup is need for such measurement.
