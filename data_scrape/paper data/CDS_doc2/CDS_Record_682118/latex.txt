ATLAS Internal Note

LARG-NO-098

16 April 1998Introduction

The geometry of the ATLAS Electromagnetic Calorimeter was designed with the idea of preserving \(\phi\) symmetry. In the Endcap Outer Wheel, for instance, there are 768 absorber plates. The geometrical configuration of the detector stays exactly the same if we rotate it by an angle of \(2\pi/768\) (roughly 8.5 mrad) with respect to the beam axis. This discrete symmetry, which can be seen as a good approximation to the continuous \(\phi\) symmetry that would be ideal (but is not achievable), gives rise to systematic effects that were already studied in [3], [1], [2].

The reduced \(\phi\) coordinate is defined as

\[\phi_{red}=\phi.MOD.N_{abs}\]

where \(N_{abs}\) is the number of absorbers (768 in the Endcap Outer Wheel, 1024 in the barrel) and the operation \(.MOD.\) consists of calculating the integer ratio and extracting the rest of this division. Then one can see that the energy signal varies for events which hit the calorimeter at different \(\phi_{red}\) values. This type of systematics can be easily seen on figure 1. The upper plot shows the ratio between generated and reconstructed energy versus \(\phi_{red}\). After applying a multiplicative correction which depends on the reconstructed value of the azimuthal angle the response can be forced to a flat shape, as it can be seen in the lower plot. The effect of this type of correction on energy resolution can be very important. The energy signal distribution for the events shown in figure 1 is displayed in figure 2 before (upper) and after (lower) correcting for \(\phi\) modulation.

In this note we analyze the shape of \(\phi\) modulation for photon event samples at several \(\eta\) values and energies. The idea is to find a simple parametrization which fits to the data for any \(\eta\) region and evolves smoothly versus the polar coordinate.

## 2 Data sample.

The analysis is done with samples of about 300-800 photon events around the following \(\eta\) values: 1.7, 1.8, 1.9, 2.0, 2.1, 2.2, 2.3 (for the Endcap) and 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, 0.9, 1.1, 1.2, 1.3 (for the barrel). In each case events were generated with random \(\eta\) uniformly distributed around the nominal value along an interval of length 0.05. This was done at three different energies, \(E_{t}=200\), 80, 50 GeV (for some of the \(\eta\) values). Events were generated using DICE (version of end 96, used for the calorimeter TDR) and reconstructed with the standard reconstruction code ATRECON (version of June 97). The energy signal in a 3x7 cell window was used throughout.

## 3 Fourier polynomials: a natural choice for the parametrization.

The main problem to be taken into account if one wants to choose a class of functions to describe \(\phi\) modulation is that its shape changes non trivially with \(\eta\). The solution proposed in this note is a truncated Fourier series. There are several reasons that suggest this choice as a natural one:

* The data we want to describe have a well defined period: \(2\pi/N_{abs}\). Any function with this property can be written as series of orthogonal terms (Fourier series) \[A_{0}+\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}\left(\,A_{k}\,cos(k\,N_{abs}\,\phi)+\,B_{k}\,sin(k \,N_{abs}\,\phi)\right)\]
* It is well known from Fourier analysis that the value of each coefficient in this series reflects the contribution to the shape under analysis of features with a characteristic wavelength. This provides a natural criterion to truncate the series: if, for example, the smallest feature detected has a length of about one fourth of the fundamental period, then we will be able to reproduce the shape very well with the first four harmonics. This trick works especially well if the shape is smooth.
* Furthermore, additional symmetries visible in the data can easily give us information about which coefficients contribute and which ones are not present at all. For example the shape shown in figure 1 is, to a good approximation, symmetric with respect to the center of the \(\phi_{red}\) scale. This implies that the sine terms will not contribute to the Fourier expansion. Of course this type of conclusion cannot be accepted without further investigation; but a detailed calculation will prove most times that the guess was correct.
* Since a Fourier polynomial is a very general parametrization for periodic functions, we can expect to obtain a smooth variation of the Fourier coefficients with respect to the \(\eta\) coordinate.

The different sets of data were fitted with the standard chi-squared routine provided by the PAW package for different sets of Fourier parameters. The contribution of all coefficients was analyzed up to the fourth harmonic. After careful analysis only five terms were retained. The polynomial used for all \(\eta\) regions is

\[P_{0}+P_{1}cos(N_{abs}\phi)+P_{4}sin(N_{abs}\phi)+P_{2}cos(2\cdot N_{abs}\phi)+P_ {3}cos(3\cdot N_{abs}\phi)\]

## 4 Results for the Endcap Outer Wheel.

### Shape variation with respect to \(\eta\).

Figures 3 to 9 show how the shape of \(\phi\) modulation evolves with \(\eta\), at both 200 and 80 GeV, where data are available. From direct visual inspection one can easily guess which Fourier coefficients are contributing most. At \(\eta=1.7\) the most important terms are the second and third symmetric harmonics (notice the two peaks), whereas the fundamental frequency contributes more and more as one moves closer to the beam line. This tendency inverts around \(\eta=2.1\). The contribution of the asymmetric term included in the analysis is small everywhere, but its effect is non-negligible in the intermediate region (from 1.9 to 2.1).

The results are summarized in figure 10. The coefficient \(P_{0}\) can be considered as a fine correction for residual \(\eta\) dependence of the energy signal, but it does not affect the problem of \(\phi\) modulation. The three symmetric coefficients (those multiplying cosine-terms) are shown in the same plot for comparison. Finally, the only asymmetric one taken into account is given in the lower plot.

Figure 11 shows the improvement in energy resolution after \(\phi\) modulation has been corrected for. The correction is most effective in the \(\eta\) regions where the contribution of the fundamental harmonic is largest (that is, where modulation is most apparent).

### Some cross-checks.

The method involves two choices, in principle arbitrary:

* One has to choose which Fourier coefficients have to be taken into account.
* Before the fits are done, points corresponding to single events have to be clustered in order to get a few "effective" points (the ones shown in \(\phi\) modulation plots), so that convergence is achieved without problems. The number of clusters chosen is arbitrary.

All Fourier coefficients up to the fourth harmonic were checked to have negligible contributions, except for those retained. The number of clusters was also varied and no variations were found.

### Impact of \(\phi\) resolution on the correction.

The variable \(\phi\) is used as the argument of the trigonometric factor applied to energy signal for correction. Therefore it is very important to make sure that this coordinate is reconstructed with a precision much better than the typical distance over which the correction varies. Figure 12 shows \(\phi\) position resolution versus energy at \(\eta=1.85\). The vertical axis is scaled in units of the spacing between two consecutive absorbers. A few points are given also for different \(\eta\) values. It can be seen that at reasonably high energies (where \(\phi\) modulation is really important, since at low energy sampling fluctuations dominate) we can reconstruct the azimuthal angle with a precision below 5 % the spacing between absorbers. The \(\phi\) modulation correction was checked to work the same whether the generated or reconstructed \(\phi\) coordinate is used, as one would expect at high energy.

Results for the barrel.

The same calculations explained in the previous sections were done for the barrel. In this case there are 1024 absorbers (instead of 768). Again photon samples were taken, covering a small \(\eta\) interval, and the shape of \(\phi\)-modulation was monitored using a Fourier polynomial with the same five terms. Samples with \(E_{t}=80\) GeV were available for all \(\eta\) values in this case, along with \(E_{t}=200\) GeV events at most of them. The shape of \(\phi\)-modulation is shown in figures 13 to 20, for both energies where data are available.

The \(\eta\)-evolution of the Fourier coefficients is shown in figures 21 and 22, for the two different energies. The only two terms with a sizeable contribution are the sine and cosine of the fundamental harmonic. Notice that the modulation has a smaller amplitude in the barrel. Therefore one can not expect much improvement in energy resolution after applying a correction. This is shown in figure 23, again for both energies.

In the transition region between Endcap and Barrel energy resolution is deteriorated by the crack and \(\phi\) modulation effect becomes negligible.

## 6 Energy dependence of \(\phi\) modulation.

\(\phi\) modulation is only important at relatively high energies, where the contribution to energy resolution from the sampling term is small enough. By comparing the shape of \(\phi\)-modulation at 80 and 200 GeV (see figures 4, 8, 15, 16, 17, 19) one can see that the shape doesn't change much with energy in most cases. In general the modulation is more apparent at 200 GeV. The contribution of sampling fluctuations in the energy signal tends to somewhat mask the effect under study at lower energies.

In order to test if the Fourier coefficients must be parametrized as energy dependent, the \(\phi\)-modulation multiplicative correction was applied to 80 GeV events using both the Fourier parameters obtained at this energy and at 200 GeV. The result is shown in figure 24. At all \(\eta\) regions where the correction yields an important improvement in energy resolution, the result is the same for both options. Only at certain barrel regions (at low \(\eta\)) a small difference is observed. Therefore we conclude that it is not necessary to use energy dependent coefficients.

Below \(E_{t}=80\) GeV the modulation is even further masked by sampling fluctuations. Even so, one can still check that the values obtained at higher energies for the Fourier parameters improve energy resolution. This was done for 50 GeV photons shot at two selected \(\eta\) in the Endcap, as shown in figure 25.

At \(\eta=2.3\) the energy-independent correction (that is, calculated with 200 GeV photons) is very effective, even better than that obtained with the 50 GeV photons themselves. This is what one could expect for a region where the effect of \(\phi\)-modulation is important: the shape of the modulation is roughly energy-independent and it can be more precisely calculated at a higher energy.

Things work somewhat worse at \(\eta=1.8\), a region where the effect is much smaller. In this case no modulation is seen and the correction calculated with 50 GeV photons helps nothing, whereas applying the factor obtained from 200 GeV events seems to worsen slightly the resolution. This confirms our conclusion that at \(\eta\) regions where \(\phi\)-modulation is important an energy-independent correction is the most reasonable solution.

However we only studied the effect of the corrections on local energy resolution, so far. As soon as we start to mix events hitting the detector at different \(\eta\) values, the parameter \(P_{0}\), which does not affect the modulation shape, will become important. The fact that \(P_{0}\) is not exactly equal to unity is telling us that the energy scale is not completely uniform across the calorimeter. Using the proposed correction for \(\phi\) modulation with an \(\eta\), \(E\) dependent \(P_{0}\) can help to correct this problem in the energy scale, at least in a preliminary way.

## 7 Modulation with different windows.

All the analysis described above was done using a 3x7 window, that is, only the energy signal inside a cluster of 3 (in \(\eta\)) by 7 (in \(\phi\)) cells is used. The fact that only a very small amount of the energy in the cluster is deposited in the outermost \(\phi\) cells strongly suggests that the \(\phi\) modulation effect under study will not change if a smaller cluster is used. This was done at two test values: \(\eta=1.7\) and \(\eta=2.3\). Figures 26 and 27 show that the shape is the same with the three choices 3x7, 3x5 and 3x3. The same set of Fourier coefficients is therefore used and if one looks carefully at the numbers given in the insets, the same values, within errors, are obtained in the three cases.

## 8 Impact on global energy resolution in the Endcap Outer wheel.

The algorithm proposed in this note displays its full potential when applied to a sample of photons shot over a large region of the calorimeter.

Figure 28 shows energy resolution before (upper) and after (lower) applying the \(\phi\) energy independent modulation correction. Energy resolution at 80 GeV changes from \(\sigma/E=1.14\pm 0.12\) % to \(\sigma/E=1.03\pm 0.10\) %. Further analysis in this direction, with larger data samples shall lead to the evaluation of the global constant term for energy resolution in the EC Outer Wheel.

## 9 Conclusions.

Dependence of energy signal on the \(\phi\) coordinate of the particle impact point at the Electromagnetic Calorimeter is, at high energies, an important effect that must be corrected for. This can be done in a very general way by using Fourier polynomials with a few terms. The coefficients are parametrized as a function of \(\eta\) using a poligonal that goes through the points found in the simulations. The data analyzed cover both the Barrel and the Endcap Outer Wheel. Energy dependence of the coefficients was found to be negligible, except for the case of the one which accounts for residual \(\eta\) dependence of the energy signal.

### Algorithm for \(\phi\) modulation correction.

The algorithm to correct for \(\phi\) modulation consists of the following steps:

* Reconstructed \(\eta\) is taken from ATRECON. The five Fourier coefficients are calculated at that value by doing linear interpolation in the tables given above. For \(P_{0}\) also the uncorrected energy can be used at this stage.
* The Fourier polynomial \[P_{0}+P_{1}cos(N_{abs}\phi)+P_{2}cos(2\cdot N_{abs}\phi)+P_{3}cos(3\cdot N_{abs }\phi)+P_{4}sin(N_{abs}\phi)\] with the calculated values for its coefficients and with frequency given by the number of absorbers (1024 in the barrel; 768 in the Endcap Outer Wheel) is evaluated at the reconstructed \(\phi\), as given by ATRECON.
* The number obtained in the previous step is applied as a multiplicative correction to the reconstructed energy in a 3x7 window provided by ATRECON.
