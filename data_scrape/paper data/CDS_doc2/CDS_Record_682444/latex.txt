**CERN, Geneva, Switzerland**Introduction

The channel \(H\to ZZ^{*}\to 4\)\(l\) is the most promising one to observe a Standard Model Higgs boson in the mass range 130 GeV-180 GeV. It puts strong requirements on the detector performance, first in terms of the mass resolution for the signal in both electron and muon final states, since in this mass region the Higgs width is quite narrow, and secondly in terms of rejection of the reducible backgrounds (i.e. \(Zb\bar{b}\) and \(t\bar{t}\)).

The region above the \(ZZ\) threshold is less critical and detector dependent, since the width of the Higgs grows rapidly, and the backgrounds are reduced to the \(ZZ\) continuum.

This note compares first the selection criteria between the two experiments, then the mass resolutions for the signal, and from there the overall acceptances. The strategy to reject the backgrounds is then reviewed, allowing a comparison of the final results in terms of observability of the signal.

## 2 Selection criteria

The selection criteria used to select 4-lepton events are very similar for ATLAS and CMS [1, 2] :

* 4 leptons with \(|\eta|\ \leq|\eta|^{\mbox{\tiny\it max}}\), and \(p_{T}\geq p_{T}^{low}\).
* At least 2 leptons with \(p_{T}\geq p_{T}^{high}\).
* 2 leptons (1,2) with appropriate flavour and charge and invariant mass \(m_{1,2}\ =\ m_{Z}\pm m_{1,2}^{window}\).
* 2 other leptons (3,4) with appropriate flavour and charge and \(m_{3,4}\geq m_{3,4}^{\mbox{\tiny\it cut}}\).

The values of the cuts used are listed below (Table 1).

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|c|c|} \hline Cuts Parameters & ATLAS & \multicolumn{2}{c|}{CMS} & \multicolumn{1}{c|}{Goal} \\ \cline{3-5}  & & 4 \(e\) & 4 \(\mu\) & \\ \hline \(|\eta|^{\mbox{\tiny\it max}}\) & 2.5 & 2.5 & 2.4 & Acceptance \\ \hline \(p_{T}^{high}\) (GeV) & 20,20 & 20,15 & 15,10 & Trigger \\ \hline \(p_{T}^{low}\) (GeV) & 7 & 10 & 5 & Acceptance vs Background \\ \hline \(m_{1,2}^{window}\) (GeV) & 6 & \(2\sigma_{Z}\) & \(2\sigma_{Z}\) & \(t\bar{t}\) rejection \\ \hline \(m_{3,4}^{cut}\) (GeV) & 20 & 12 & 12 & \(ZZ^{*}/\gamma^{*}\) rejection \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 1: Summary of the cuts used by ATLAS and CMS.

Four significant differences can be observed :

* CMS uses a lower \(p_{T}\)-threshold for detecting muons. However a simple particle level study shows that the signal significance (assuming that the dominant background is the irreducible one, which may be optimistic due to the fast increase of the reducible background contribution at low \(p_{T}\)), increases marginally (\(m_{H}=130\) GeV) and even decreases (\(m_{H}=170\) GeV), when lowering this threshold, as shown in Fig. 1.
* In the same way, lowering the \(p_{T}\)-threshold on the two highest-\(p_{T}\) leptons brings little gain, at the expense of possible difficulties at the trigger level, as shown in Fig. 2.
* CMS uses a narrower mass window around the \(Z\) mass (around \(\pm\) 4 GeV as discussed in the next Section). The main motivation is the rejection of the \(t\bar{t}\) background, which contains no genuine \(Z\). As will be shown in the next section, this cut has a strong effect on the overall signal acceptance due to experimental tails in the distributions and off-shell \(Z\) contributions.
* ATLAS has used a higher cut on the invariant mass of the remaining leptons (20 GeV versus 12 GeV). This higher value slightly reduces the signal acceptance mostly at low Higgs masses (14 % reduction for \(m_{H}=130\) GeV, 2 % for \(m_{H}=170\) GeV), whereas the irreducible \(ZZ^{*}/\gamma^{*}\) background is significantly reduced, because of the still large contribution of the \(\gamma^{*}\)-pole [3]. As an example the reduction is found to be 44 % at 130 GeV, and 24 % at 170 GeV [4]. The chosen mass cut of 20 GeV thus optimizes the signal significance.

## 3 Signal mass resolution

### Electron final state

Both experiments have studied, using full simulation, material and magnetic field effects in the central tracker. To minimize the impact of external bremsstrahlung, the energy in the calorimeter is collected in an asymmetric cone (\(\Delta\eta\times\Delta\phi=0.075\times 0.175\) for ATLAS, 0.08 \(\times\) 0.11 for CMS). Note that, despite the larger magnetic field, which in addition is present also in the electromagnetic calorimeter, CMS uses a smaller cluster size than ATLAS.

Finally, CMS explicitly included the contribution from inner bremsstrahlung, while ATLAS did not. This omission in the case of ATLAS was mainly motivated by the desire to understand first the potential distorsion of the signal (tails) due to the detector itself. The effect of inner bremsstrahlung, as estimated by CMS, leads to a loss of 12 % of acceptance, when cutting around the \(Z\) mass at \(\pm\) 6 GeV. Table 2 below summarizes the main points of the comparison, in the four-electron channel. For the quoted fractions of events within \(\pm\) 3 \(\sigma_{m_{Z}}\), the fractions of Higgs decays with both Z-bosons off mass-shell was not included.

An example of the distribution of the reconstructed four-electron final state signal can be found in Fig. 3 (Fig. 11.15 from the CMS TP). In ATLAS the tails are much less important (see Fig. 5), for the same amount of material in the tracker. As discussed above, this is due to the stronger magnetic field and smaller cluster sized used in CMS. This effect can be seen for converted photons in CMS as compared to ATLAS (see Fig. 11.19 of the CMS TP).

Two recent CMS notes [5, 6] using a fast simulation for electrons, yield significantly better mass resolutions for the signal. They have been obtained with a cut on the \(Z\) mass at \(\pm 2\sigma\), which improves the Higgs mass resolution, since they minimize the contributions of external bremsstrahlung, but however decrease the overall acceptance (see section 4).

### Muon final state

CMS has used a parametrized single muon momentum resolution (obtained from full simulation), while ATLAS has used a full simulation and reconstruction of the muons through the tracker and the toroid.

As for electrons, CMS has included the contribution from inner bremsstrahlung, quoted as a 7 % loss in a window of \(\pm\) 6 GeV around the \(Z\) mass.

CMS presents masses reconstructed using the combined tracker and muon system information, whereas ATLAS presents stand-alone measurements using the toroid alone, the central tracker alone and both combined.

Examples of the quality of the muon reconstruction in CMS are shown in Fig. 4 (Fig. 11.11 of the CMS TP) and summarized in Table 3 below:

The combined muon/tracker Higgs mass resolution is significantly better in CMS, for which it is determined by the inner tracker performance (\(\sigma_{m_{H}}\)= 1.0 GeV for \(m_{H}\)=150 GeV).

In ATLAS, the mass resolutions obtained using the inner tracker or muon system alone, as shown in Fig. 6, are very similar (\(\sigma_{m_{H}}\)= 1.7 to 2.0 GeV for \(m_{H}\) =130 GeV) and the combined overall resolution, quoted as 1.6 GeV in Table 3, should improve to \(\simeq\)1.4 GeV with more work on the energy loss corrections

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|} \hline Measurements & ATLAS & CMS \\  & (\(m_{H}\) =130 GeV) & (\(m_{H}\) =150 GeV) \\ \hline \(m_{Z}(GeV)\) & 91.1 & 89. \\ \hline \(\sigma_{m_{Z}}\) (GeV) & 2.1 & 2.3 \\ \hline Events in \(\pm 3\sigma(\%)\) & 95 & 80 \\ \hline \hline \(m_{H}(GeV)\) & 130.0 & 146.0 \\ \hline \(\sigma_{m_{H}}\) (GeV) & 1.6 & 2.0 \\ \hline Events in \(\pm 2\sigma(\%)\) & 93 & 70 \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 2: Mass resolutions in the 4-electron channel for ATLAS and CMS (inner bremsstrahlung effects not included in the case of ATLAS).

in the calorimeter and on the track reconstruction programs. The stand-alone muon resolution of CMS (see Fig. 11.9 of the CMS TP) is estimated to be larger than 5.0 GeV, a performance significantly worse than in ATLAS.

### Inner bremsstrahlung contribution in ATLAS

After the TP, the inner bremsstrahlung contribution in ATLAS was evaluated using the PYTHIA 5.7 generator interfaced with the PHOTOS package [7], thus allowing the production of up to 2 photons (1 per \(Z\)) in the Higgs decay.

The contribution of inner bremsstrahlung was evaluated by studying :

* the acceptance of the mass window around \(m_{Z}\) (\(\pm 6\) GeV).
* the acceptance of the mass window around \(m_{Z}\) (\(\pm 2\sigma_{m_{Z}}\)).
* the overall acceptance.

Two possibilities to minimize the effect of inner bremsstrahlung photons were investigated :

1. Collect the photons in a cone \(\Delta R\) around the lepton, since most of them are soft and collinear.
2. Include isolated photons produced with \(p_{T}\geq p_{T}^{\rm cut}\) in the calculation of \(m_{Z}\) and \(m_{Z}\).

Both approaches can be combined for electrons in the final state (nearby photons are automatically included in the electromagnetic cluster in most cases), whereas only the second approach can most likely be applied to muons, since collecting low energy gammas in a cluster around the muons will be probably spoiled by noise and energy resolution in the electromagnetic calorimeter.

Results obtained at particle level for a Higgs mass of 130 GeV, can be seen in Fig. 7, and are summarized in Table 4 below. Similar results were obtained for Higgs masses around 180 GeV.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|l|} \hline Variables & ATLAS & CMS & Remarks \\  & (\(m_{H}\)=130 GeV) & (\(m_{H}\)=150 GeV) & \\ \hline \(\sigma_{m_{Z}}\) (GeV) & 2.1 & 1.8 & \\ \hline in \(\pm 3\sigma\)(\%) & 95 & 85 & off-shell \(Z\) effects removed \\ \hline \hline \(\sigma_{m_{Z}}\) (GeV) & 2.0 & \(\simeq\) 5 & stand-alone muon system \\ \hline \(\sigma_{m_{Z}}\) (GeV) & 1.6 & 1.0 & combined muon/tracker \\ \hline in \(\pm 2\sigma\)(\%) & 93 & 85 & \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 3: Mass resolutions in the 4-muon channel for ATLAS and CMS (inner bremsstrahlung effects not included in the case of ATLAS).

The inner bremsstrahlung contribution is potentially larger in the electron final state, as expected, but the overall effect after photon recovery is in fact somewhat less than for the muon final state, since one can recover the photons in a cone around the electrons. The overall loss expected is 8 % for muons and 4 % for electrons.

To confirm these particle level results, Higgs decays to 4 electrons were simulated for \(m_{H}=130\) GeV as shown after reconstruction in Fig. 8. No special treatment was applied yet to correct for the response in the barrel-end-cap transition region. These preliminary results show that the overall mass resolution (1.7 GeV) is not affected by the inner bremsstrahlung, since this resolution is similar to that quoted in the Technical Proposal. One should note the slight improvement in the case without bremsstrahlung (1.56 GeV in Fig. 8 versus 1.7 GeV in the ATLAS TP), coming from a more performant geometry of the electromagnetic calorimeter [4].

The tails created by inner bremsstrahlung correspond to a 5 % loss for the mass window around \(m_{Z}\) (\(\pm\) 6 GeV), and to a 4 % loss for the \(\pm 2\sigma\) mass bin around the Higgs mass. Both these results are in agreement with the particle level results shown above, and the overall net effect of less than 10 % confirms the smaller impact of inner brem. in the weaker magnetic field of ATLAS.

Although full simulation still has to be studied for muons in the final state, in the following, a 10 % loss on the overall signal acceptance due to inner brem. will conservatively be used.

## 4 Signal rates

Concerning the production cross-sections, both ATLAS and CMS have used PYTHIA 5.7 with a modern set of structure functions, without including K-factor contributions. The values are in good agreement, as shown in Table 5.

The geometrical acceptances, i.e. those of the pseudo-rapidity and transverse momentum cuts on the leptons, are summarized in Table 6. It appears that, averaged over the various final states, ATLAS and CMS have very similar geometrical acceptances, despite the slightly different choices of \(p_{T}\) thresholds.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|c|c|c|} \hline Variables & NO & BREM. & \multicolumn{3}{c|}{BREM. WITH CORR.} \\  & BREM. & NO CORR. & 4e: \(\gamma\)’s & 4\(\mu\): \(\gamma\)’s & 4e \\  & & 4e - 4\(\mu\) & \(\Delta\)\(R\)=0.07 & \(p_{T}\geq\) 7 GeV & Both \\ \hline \(m_{Z}\pm 6\) GeV Acc. (\%) & 76 & 64 - 71 & 72 & 75 & 75 \\ \hline \(m_{H}\pm 2\sigma\) Acc. (\%) & 95 & 76 - 86 & 89 & 89 & 90 \\ \hline Overall Acc.(\%) & 100 & 64 - 83 & 88 & 92 & 96 \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 4: Inner brem. contributions, estimated at particle-level for ATLAS, for \(m_{H}\)=130 GeV.

The overall acceptances of the two experiments, putting together all the input values mentioned above and the lepton reconstruction efficiency are compared in Table 7 :

To compare on uniform grounds the overall acceptances of the two experiments, an overall efficiency (including trigger, identification and reconstruction) of 90 % per lepton was used for both experiments. For the low-\(p_{T}\) leptons involved in this channel, a higher value of 95 % seems difficult to reach.

The ATLAS acceptances (see Table 8) are found to be \(\simeq\) 30 % better than those of CMS, mainly due to the larger losses from tails in the reconstructed mass distributions in CMS. These losses depend of course on details of the detector simulation and on the choice of the mass window around \(m_{Z}\).

## 5 Background rates

The cross-sections used by ATLAS [3] and CMS [8] for the backgrounds are summarized in Table 9. Moreover using Table 12.4a of the CMS TP, reproduced in Table 10 (where backgrounds rates are given per GeV), and Table 11.9 of the

\end{table}
Table 5: Comparison of the signal cross-sections.

ATLAS TP (backgrounds given in \(\pm\) 4 GeV) reproduced in Table 12 one can compare the rates expected by the two experiments:

The big discrepancies between some of the estimates in Table 9 call for comments :

\(\bullet\)\(ZZ^{*}/\gamma^{*}\)

Both experiments have used the same procedure to evaluate this background. At the end the rate is 30 % higher for ATLAS, which could be explained if CMS had not taken into account the extra contribution from \(gg\to ZZ^{*}/\gamma^{*}\), which amounts to 30 % [9]. This contribution is not mentioned in the CMS TP.

\(\bullet\)\(t\bar{t}\)

The total cross-sections are in fair agreement. Even after rescaling the ATLAS rate by 2/3, due to the different widths of the windows used around the \(Z\)-mass, the expected rate is about a factor three higher in ATLAS. The different thresholds used on the lepton-\(p_{T}\) cannot explain this effect [10]. We note that the inclusion of cascade decays represents about 75 % of the total \(t\bar{t}\) background, a contribution which actually explains the difference, since it has not been taken into account by CMS [8].

\(\bullet\)\(Zb\bar{b}\)

This largest discrepancy cannot be explained, neither by lepton \(p_{T}\)-thresholds nor by cascade decays which represent only about 30 % of the total \(Zb\bar{b}\) background. One has checked explicitly consistency inside ATLAS with the Letter of Intent, Aachen [11], and previous studies [12], where only direct decays had been evaluated using an exact matrix element simulation.

Such large discrepancies in the estimated rates, understood now as a wrong normalization in CMS [8], have obviously direct consequences on the background rejection strategies.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|c|} \hline Overall Acceptance(\%) & \(m_{H}=130\) GeV & \(m_{H}=150\) GeV & \(m_{H}=170\) GeV \\ \hline ATLAS & 14.8 & 21.9 & 25.6 \\ \hline CMS & 11.2 & 16.4 & 18.9 \\ \hline \end{tabular}

\end{table}
Table 9: Background cross-sections and rates.

Background rejection

To reject the reducible backgrounds from \(t\bar{t}\) and \(Zb\bar{b}\) decays, CMS uses tracking isolation applied to 3 out of 4 leptons, requiring no charged track with \(p_{T}\geq 2.5\) GeV within a cone of 0.2 around the lepton. This rather high value of the charged track \(p_{T}\)-threshold allows a good signal efficiency (95 %), almost insensitive to pile-up, but at the expense of rather low background rejections (5 against \(t\bar{t}\) and 2 against \(Zb\bar{b}\)). The calorimeter isolation, which could be problematic due to the high magnetic field, has not been studied in detail.

Quantitative results in the CMS TP are shown only for the 4-muon final state (due to the better mass resolution in this channel, a narrower mass window around \(m_{Z}\) is used, thus reducing further the dominant \(t\bar{t}\) background). Nevertheless, as shown in Table 12.4b of the TP reproduced in Table 11, the reducible backgrounds are at the same level as the \(ZZ^{*}/\gamma^{*}\) continuum after these isolation cuts.

ATLAS uses both tracking and calorimeter isolation, based on full simulation results. Even if both isolations are strongly correlated, their combination provides good robustness versus luminosity. In fact, the estimated 50 % loss of signal efficiency from calorimeter isolation at high luminosity is conservative, since the tracker elements are faster than the calorimeter.

More importantly, isolation alone is not sufficient to bring the large reducible backgrounds down to a small fraction of the \(ZZ^{*}/\gamma^{*}\) continuum.

ATLAS therefore also uses the impact parameter measurement to reject the reducible backgrounds. The non-negligible correlation between impact parameter rejection and isolation rejection is properly taken into account. Full simulation and reconstruction of the 4-muon events reproduces properly the particle level simulation results of the TP, as shown in Fig. 9. The combination of isolation and impact parameter cuts brings the \(t\bar{t}+Zb\bar{b}\) contribution below 15 % of the irreducible \(ZZ^{*}/\gamma^{*}\) background. Obviously CMS could also use their pixel vertexing layer to study impact parameter cuts (see Fig. 11.3 of the CMS TP).

## 7 Final results

### Low luminosity

CMS does not mention any results in the intermediate mass range at low luminosity. Extrapolating the results from Table 10 and Table 11, originating from the CMS TP, the expected CMS significances for the same integrated luminosity are about 80% lower than those of ATLAS, with approximately equal contributions from reducible and continuum backgrounds.

ATLAS would observe a Higgs boson signal, in the mass range 130-180 GeV, with more than 5 \(\sigma\) significance, after 3 years of running at low luminosity, and with reducible backgrounds below 15 % of the irreducible continuum back ground (see Table 13).

### High luminosity

CMS presents results with no isolation cuts, after one year at high luminosity (Table 10). These results are somewhat academic, at least for electrons, since electron identification in the calorimeter automatically implies some isolation. Moreover the reducible backgrounds are much higher than the continuum in this case.

Results with isolation cuts are presented for CMS in Table 11, for 2 years of running at high luminosity, and only for 4-muon events,with very low \(p_{T}\)-thresholds on the muons. The reducible backgrounds are at the same level as the \(ZZ^{*}/\gamma^{*}\) contribution in this case, leading to significances about 30 % lower than the corresponding ATLAS ones obtained for all 4-lepton states, after only 1 year at high luminosity, and with a good safety margin with respect to reducible backgrounds.

## 8 Conclusions

The \(H\to ZZ^{*}\to 4\)\(l\) channel can be observed by ATLAS over the mass range 130-180 GeV, at low luminosity (\(3\times 10^{4}\)pb\({}^{-1}\)) and high luminosity (\(10^{5}\)pb\({}^{-1}\)), with a comfortable safety margin against reducible backgrounds.

In the case of CMS, the current analysis presented in the Technical Proposal shows rather marginal results for \(2\times 10^{5}\)pb\({}^{-1}\), without any safety margin. Nevertheless, the two detectors will probably provide the same rejection power against reducible backgrounds, since both can use isolation and impact parameter cuts. This nevertheless has to be assessed more quantitatively with full simulation studies.

ATLAS exhibits an overall signal acceptance \(\simeq 30\) % higher than CMS, with better mass resolution for electrons and for muons measured in stand-alone mode, but with worse mass resolution for muons measured using the whole detector.

Figure 7: ATLAS evaluation of the inner brem. contribution to the the Higgs signal overall acceptance. Circles (triangles) represent the 4e (4\(\mu\)) final state. The 3 plots on the top represent the \(m_{Z}\) mass window acceptance (left), the \(m_{H}\) mass window acceptance (middle) and the overall acceptance (right) as a function of the em cluster cone size \(\Delta\)\(R\) (only for electrons). The 3 plots on the bottom represent the same acceptance versus the \(p_{T}\)-threshold of the inner brem. photons. For the 4-electron final state, these acceptances are presented after collecting the photons in a cone of 0.07 around the electrons.

Figure 8: ATLAS reconstruction of \(H\to 4\)\(e\) decays for \(m_{H}\) 130 GeV. Shown are all events (top), events with no inner brem. (middle), and with at least one inner brem. photon (bottom). Events with electrons in the barrel/endcap crack (\(1.42\,\leq\,|\eta|\,\leq\,1.57\)) were included, although further calibration work is required in this region. The effect of the em calorimeter constant term and electronic noise was included.
