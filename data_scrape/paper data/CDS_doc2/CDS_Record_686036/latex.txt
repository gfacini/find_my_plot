**Abstract**

This INDET note contains a First Year Report submitted by Lee Drage for registration as a PhD student at the University of Cambridge.

Using the TDR versions (September 1996) of the Inner Detector simulation and iPatRec, the effects of increased SCT noise and inefficiency on single track reconstruction efficiency, fake rates and distribution tails have been studied. The detector layout modelled in this simulation is shown to be highly robust to increased SCT noise and inefficiency.

Introduction

The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is a 14 TeV proton-proton collider with a luminosity of \(10^{34}\)cm\({}^{-2}\)s\({}^{-1}\) which will begin operation in 2005. ATLAS (A Toroidal LHC Apparatus) is a general purpose detector which will surround one of the LHC interaction points. It is designed to fully explore any new physics encountered in the energy regime of the LHC and comprises four subdetectors: an inner tracker, an electromagnetic calorimeter, a hadronic calorimeter and a muon spectrometer.

This report documents a study of the robustness of an ATLAS Inner Tracker simulation to increased noise and inefficiency. The role, specifications and layout of the Inner Tracker are described in section 2. The simulation section explains how the inner detector is simulated and how noise and inefficiency are introduced. The method section explains how noise and inefficiency are varied and how the resulting changes in detector performance are measured. Results are presented in the next section which is followed by conclusions.

## 2 The Inner Detector

### Detector roles and specifications

The role of the Inner Detector is to provide accurate momentum and vertex measurement of products of the p-p collisions and good b-tagging1. Physics studies have been used to compile a list of specifications which, if fulfilled, will allow the Inner Detector and ATLAS in general to adequately study new LHC physics [1]. This report is concerned with isolated track pattern recognition for which the relevant performance requirement is that isolated tracks with \(p_{T}\geq 5\) GeV should be reconstructed with an efficiency of \(\geq 95\%\) and a fake rate \(\leq 1\%\).

### Inner detector layout

Whilst the general design of the Inner Tracker has been decided, the finer details of its layout have yet to be finalised. The layout described below is that modelled in the September 1996 version of the Inner Detector simulation used for the Technical Design Report (TDR) performance studies. The description is brief and concentrates on the detector geometry; the intricate details of detector modules and descriptions of detector supports and services are omitted. A detailed description of the same layout can be found in volume 1 of the Inner Detector TDR [2].

The Inner Tracker is seen in figure 1 to have three component detectors: A pixel detector, a SemiConducting Tracker (SCT) and a Transition Radiation Tracker (TRT).

#### Pixels

The pixel detector surrounds the interaction point and is charged with providing good pattern recognition, good transverse impact parameter resolution and good b-tagging. The pixel detector comprises a barrel detector and two symmetric endcaps.

The building block of the barrel detector is a barrel pixel module, the active component of which is a 150\(\upmu\)m thick, 6.58cm x 2.54cm, n-type silicon wafer. An orthogonal grid of 50\(\upmu\)m x 300\(\upmu\)m implants of n\({}^{+}\) silicon provides discretisation. The barrel consists of 3 concentric, cylindrical layers. Each layer is composed of several ladders, formed by laying 11 or 13 pixel modules end to end so that the 6.58cm edges of the Si (and the 300\(\upmu\)m pixel sides) are parallel to the z-axis. The details of the barrel layers are given in table 1.

Each wheel is composed of rings of pixel modules placed inside one another. The z-position and rings from which each wheel is formed are given in table 2, the details of each ring type being found in table 3. The 150\(\mu\)m thick, silicon wafer of the pixel endcap module is trapezoid, 5.3cm high with inner and outer edges of 1.249cm and 1.491cm respectively.

\end{table}
Table 3: Pixel endcap ring details.

tronics for each rectangle are placed on a 2.14cm x 11.0cm board joined to the silicon along its long edge. Barrel modules are arranged in ladders of 12, with unrotated strips running parallel to the z-axis, and then into 4 cylindrical layers of which the details are given in table 4.

SCT endcap modules are trapezoid in shape. The dimensions and active material of an endcap module depend on its position within the detector. Silicon is used for outer rings in the endcap wheels and GaAs for the innermost ring. Each module is formed from two trapezoids of active material,1 placed either side of a beryllia substrate with one being rotated by 40mrad with respect to the other. Each crystal of active material is segmented into 768 keystone-shaped strips which run perpendicular to the parallel edges of the trapezoid. The strip pitch depends on the radial position of the module. The endcap modules are first arranged in rings, with strips aligned radially, which are in turn built up into the wheels which form the endcap detector. Wheels are rotated in \(\varphi\) with respect to one another to ensure endcap hermiticity. Details of each ring and wheel type are given in table 5 and table 6 respectively.

#### 2.2.3 Transition radiation tracker

The TRT provides a large number of measurement points along each track. It is the outermost component of the Inner Detector and, like the other subdetectors, is also composed of a barrel and two endcaps.

The basic component of the TRT is a 4mm diameter straw detector. The same straws, varying only in length, are used throughout the TRT. The gaps between straws are filled with a radiator material which causes electrons to emit transition radiation photons, aiding electron identification.

The barrel TRT occupies the volume \(|\eta|\leq 0.5\) (approx.), \(56\mbox{cm}\leq R\leq 107\mbox{cm}\). Straws in the barrel are aligned with the z-axis, in 73 radial layers. They are 148cm long but broken into two electrically isolated halves at z=0. The first nine layers of straws are inactive in the z range \(|z|\leq 40\mbox{cm}\) to reduce straw occupancy.

In the TRT endcaps, straws are aligned radially in 18 wheels. The first 14 wheels have 16 or 8 planes of 768 straws in z and occupy \(64\mbox{cm}\leq R\leq 103\mbox{cm}\). These are spaced approximately evenly between \(|z|\,=\,83\mbox{cm}\) and \(|z|\,=\,278\mbox{cm}\). The remaining 4 wheels have 16 planes of 576 straws in z, occupy \(48\mbox{cm}\leq R\leq 103\mbox{cm}\)  and are evenly spaced between \(|z|\) = 282cm  and \(|z|\,=\,335\mbox{cm}\).

## 3 Simulation and Reconstruction

The inner detector simulation can be divided into two stages. Firstly the particles of an event are tracked, using GEANT, through the material of the layout described above, the associated services and the supporting structures. At this stage, one of the two layers of an SCT barrel module, for example, is simply described by two rectangles joined at their long sides: One a 12.82cm x

\end{table}

A uniform, axial, 2 Tesla magnetic field is simulated throughout the Inner Detector. This is a simplification of the real field, one effect of which is an improved momentum resolution.

In the second stage of simulation, digitisation, the response of active areas of the detector is simulated. It is at this stage that the active material of each detector is divided into individual pixels, strips or straws. Noise and inefficiency are introduced during digitisation.

Once the detector response has been simulated, a pattern recognition program, iPatRec, is used to try and reconstruct particle tracks.

### Digitisation

#### Pixel digitisation

It is envisaged that binary readout electronics will be used with the pixel detector and this has been simulated. The result, therefore, of digitisation is a list of pixel channels in which the charge deposited is above an acceptance threshold of 2000 electrons1; no pulse height information is retained. Pixel inefficiency is simulated by randomly flagging 3% of pixels as being inefficient. These channels are not used by the pattern recognition program in track reconstruction. Noise is simulated by adding charge to each pixel according to a Gaussian distribution, the width of which is chosen to give 1 in 10\({}^{5}\) pixels with noise above the 2000 electron acceptance threshold. Noise is only added to modules in which a particle hit was recorded.

Footnote 1: A relativistic particle traversing the 150\(\mu\)m  of silicon at normal incidence produces charge distributed as a Landau distribution with a mean of 13000 electrons.

#### SCT digitisation

The silicon tracker will also use binary readout electronics and its simulation is similar to that of the pixel layers. The acceptance threshold in the SCT has a default value of 7500 electrons. Noise and efficiency are simulated in the same way as in the pixel detector. For the SCT the sigma of the Gaussian noise distribution, \(\sigma_{N}\), is, by default, set at 1875 electrons giving 1 in 10\({}^{4}\) strips above the acceptance threshold. Again, noise is only added to strips in modules crossed by at least one particle. The default SCT inefficiency is 3%.

#### TRT digitisation

The simulation of the TRT response is complicated and not described here. A full description is given in Volume 1 of the Inner Detector TDR [3]. No TRT noise is simulated.

### Pattern recognition

The September 1996 (TDR) version of iPatRec, a pattern recognition program which initiates track finding in the precision (pixel and SCT) layers, has been used to obtain all results in this report. In addition to containing details of tracks reconstructed by iPatRec, the output n-tuple from reconstruction also contains KINE banks: details of the generated or KINE tracks. This allows the comparison of generated and reconstructed track parameters.

## 4 Method

### Changing SCT noise and inefficiency

In this study the SCT inefficiency has been varied between 0% and 20% and the SCT noise has been varied in two ways:

1. Increasing the noise sigma \(\sigma_{\mathrm{N}}\) and maintaining the acceptance threshold at \(4\sigma_{N}\) to keep the fraction of noisy strips above threshold constant.
2. Increasing \(\sigma_{\mathrm{N}}\) whilst keeping the acceptance threshold fixed at 7500 e- therefore increasing the fraction of noisy strips above threshold.

When varying detector efficiency the noise sigma and acceptance threshold are held constant at their default values and vice versa. At any one time, the same SCT noise and inefficiency are simulated in all silicon layers of both the barrel and endcaps. The noise and inefficiency in the pixel layers are not changed from their default values of \(10^{-5}\) above-threshold pixels and 3% respectively.

In the actual detector, faced with increasingly noisy channels, the acceptance threshold may initially be raised to maintain as clean a signal as possible. However at some point the rising threshold will begin to remove low pulse height particle impacts and then the fraction of noisy strips above threshold will be allowed to rise. Both ways of changing the noise are therefore relevant to the real detector.

### Measuring detector performance

Three measures of detector performance have been used to study the effect of increased noise and inefficiency: Single muon reconstruction efficiency, fake track rates and distribution tails. The first two are measures of the ability of the detector and pattern recognition to reconstruct particle trajectories correctly; the latter quantifies the quality of the reconstructed tracks.

## 5 Results

### Efficiency and fake rate studies

#### 5.1.1 Definitions

For the single track reconstruction efficiency studies single, 20 GeV muons have been simulated with and without pile-up. For these studies LHC design luminosity levels of pile-up have been modelled; hence pile-up is added to single muon events by superimposing 23 minimum bias events. Both the minimum bias events and muons have a vertex spread described by Gaussian distributions in x, y and z with \(\sigma_{\mathrm{x}}=\sigma_{\mathrm{y}}=15\mu\mathrm{m}\) and \(\sigma_{\mathrm{z}}=5.6\mathrm{cm}\).

The _single muon reconstruction efficiency_ is defined as the fraction of _accepted_ reconstructed tracks. A reconstructed track is accepted if it has:

* at least 7 out of an average of 11 hits1 from the precision (pixel and SCT) layers.
* at least 2 out of an average of 3 hits in the pixel layers.
* an impact parameter \(|d0|<1\)mm
* at least 50% of precision layer hits produced uniquely by one KINE track.

The numbers in this definition are rather arbitrary. In principle it is possible to define an accepted track so that the single track reconstruction efficiency is always 100%. To take an extreme example, if the only criterion for a track to be accepted was having four precision hits, all muon trajectories through the tracker would probably be found. However, in addition to finding the muon tracks, the pattern recognition algorithm would also reconstruct many other _fake_ tracks by interpreting aligned noise and pile-up hits as being due to a single muon. If the cuts for accepting a track are too loose the real tracks will be swamped by fakes. It is therefore essential that a study of single track efficiency is complemented by a study of fake rates.

The same single 20 GeV muon events are used in the fake rate study as in the efficiency work. Only events with pile-up are used because the number of above-threshold hits, and therefore the fake rates, will be much greater than in the corresponding events without. Fake rates are studied by searching, in each piled-up muon event, for tracks in 275 non-overlapping, \(\Delta\eta\) x \(\Delta\varphi=0.2\) x 0.2 'cones' within the inner detector coverage. The _fake rate_ is defined by:

\[\mbox{Fake rate in 0.2 x 0.2 = \frac{\mbox{Number of fake tracks reconstructed}}{\mbox{Number of cones searched}}}\]

A standard _fake track_ is defined as having:

* at least 7 precision hits
* at least 2 pixel hits
* an impact parameter \(|d0|<1\)mm
* a transverse momentum \(p_{\tau}>5\) GeV.
* less than 50% of _unique_ precision layer hits associated with it.

The hits (clusters built around above-threshold strips or pixels by pattern recognition) to which the reconstructed tracks are fitted are classified by iPatRec into one of three categories: unique, spoilt and wrong. A hit is classified as _unique_ if it was produced uniquely by the one KINE track which produced the majority of hits associated to the reconstructed track. A _spoil_ hit is produced by two or more KINE tracks, one KINE track and noise or by pure noise. A _wrong_ hit is produced by one KINE track alone but not that which produced the majority of hits.

The requirement of less than 50% unique hits along a track results in a fairly loose definition of a fake. The following types of hits will contribute to the 50% of wrong and spoilt hits required to render a track fake:

1. A hit from the KINE track which produced the majority of hits plus noise.
2. A hit from the KINE track which produced the majority of hits plus another KINE hit.
3. A pure noise hit.

4. A hit from one or more wrong KINE tracks (i.e. not the track producing the majority of track hits).
5. As 4) plus noise.

The first two hit types are undesirable because their presence widens the fake definition to encompass spoilt tracks; real KINE tracks of which a certain number of hits have been spoilt by noise or other KINE track hits. In the purest definition, a fake results from the misinterpretation by pattern recognition of randomly aligned noise and pile-up hits. With the above definition a 'fake' could equally be a spoilt pile-up track with \(p_{T}>5\) GeV. A priori hit types 1 and 2 are equally probable as types 3 and 4 respectively. The average multiplicity, however, in a cone of size \(\Delta\eta\) x \(\Delta\varphi=0.2\) x 0.2  of charged particles from the 23 minimum bias events of pile-up with \(p_{T}>1\) GeV  is 93.7x10-3 and falls to 8.8x10-4 for \(p_{T}>5\) GeV [4]. Therefore spoilt tracks should contribute insignificantly to the fake rate.

The standard fake rate definition includes no requirement of TRT hits. If at least one TRT hit is required all fake rates presented in this report fall to zero.

In addition to the standard definitions of efficient and fake tracks, several variations have also been used in this report. The desire to have both fake and efficient tracks defined similarly (in terms of number of hits etc.) has meant a fairly loose definition of an accepted track has been chosen so that the fake rate is not so low as to be immeasurable. Ordinarily, a tighter definition of an accepted track, requiring the use of a larger proportion of the Inner Detector layers, would be used and therefore efficiency data for a second definition of an accepted track has been produced. This definition, referred to as the _TDR definition_, is similar to the standard set of efficiency cuts but requires 9 (instead of 7) precision hits and a hit in the first (B) pixel layer. This definition is identical to that used in the TDR and therefore allows comparison and demonstrates consistency with results presented in it.

Even with the standard fake rate definition, the relatively small number of cones searched means that the statistics for these rates are often poor. In order to reduce error bar sizes, allowing trends to be more convincingly displayed, a second, looser fake definition is also used. This is identical to the standard definition except that only 6 precision hits (instead of 7) are required. This is referred to as the _6 hits, 5GeV_ definition. Another two variations on the standard fake definition are used to study fakes with p\({}_{T}>\)2GeV with at least 6 (_6 hits, 2GeV_ definition) and 7 (_7 hits, 2GeV_ definition) precision hits. The 5GeV minimum transverse momentum cut in the standard definition was chosen to allow comparison of results with the performance specifications in section 2.1. The 2GeV definitions allow comparison with TDR results.

#### Changing SCT inefficiency

In figure 5.1 the variation with SCT inefficiency of muon reconstruction efficiency and fake rates is shown. Two sets of fake rates are plotted; fakes defined by standard and 6 hits, 5GeV definitions. No fake tracks were found for the standard fake cuts at several inefficiencies. In these cases a 90% confidence upper limit is indicated by the lines at the bottom of the figure.

The variations of standard and TDR efficiencies with SCT inefficiency are shown separately in figure 5.2. In both cases the efficiency is seen in to fall with increasing SCT inefficiency. Figure 5.2 also demonstrates that the addition of pile-up changes the single track reconstruction efficiency by very little. With the standard cuts, the efficiency falls to 95% at around 20% detector inefficiency. The 95% point is passed at around 12% SCT inefficiency for the TDR cuts.

In figure 5.3, fake rates for the standard; 5Gev, 6hits; 2GeV, 7 hits and 2GeV, 6hits definitions are shown. Again, where no fake tracks were found in the cones searched, upper limits are indicated by solid lines at the bottom of the figure.

Figure 5.2: Variation of efficiency with SCT inefficiency. Figure 5.

The fake rate varies little with increasing SCT inefficiency. The only conceivable way in which increasing inefficiency could affect fake rates is by removing a track hit from one layer. Pattern recognition then has to extrapolate a track using a hit, not in the next layer, but the one after with a resulting increased chance of error. These results show that this is a very small or nonexistent effect. For the 2 GeV, 7 hits definition, the fake rate averages 2.73x10\({}^{-4}\). For the standard fake definition (5 GeV, 7 hits) this average has an upper limit of 2.3x10\({}^{-4}\) which is comfortably below the performance specification of 1%.

For increasing SCT inefficiency the performance is limited by the reconstruction efficiency and not by fake rates. For the standard cuts the detector will tolerate up to 20% inefficiency although it should be noted that randomly killing individual strips is not a particularly realistic way of introducing inefficiency. In the real detector it is likely that inefficiency will be caused by dead readout chips, for example, resulting in a more correlated inefficiency.

Figures 5.4 and 5.5 show the muon reconstruction efficiency plotted against the pseudorapidity of the reconstructed muon for the standard and TDR cuts. It can be seen that, with increasing SCT inefficiency, efficiency is lost fairly evenly throughout the pseudorapidity coverage.

In figure 5.6 the \(\rm p_{T}\) spectrum of 6 precision hit fake tracks is investigated. Most fakes are seen to have a transverse momentum of less than 10 GeV. Figure 5.7 shows the effect of varying the impact parameter \(\rm d_{0}\) for 5 GeV, 6 hit fake tracks. The fake rate rises linearly with increasing \(\rm d_{0}\) until cuts intrinsic to iPatRec cause the rate to level off at around \(\rm d_{0}\)=0.15 cm.

#### Changing the fraction of above-threshold noise hits

In figure 5.8 the variation of efficiency and fake rates with the fraction of above-threshold hits in the SCT is shown. Again, two fake rates are plotted: rates for standard and 5GeV, 6 hits definitions.

In figure 5.9 the efficiencies for the standard and TDR cuts are shown separately. For this study no pile-up efficiencies have successfully been obtained. By inference from figures 5.2 and 5.16, the pile-up efficiencies are not expected to differ greatly from those without pile-up. The efficiency is seen to fall very slowly with increasing noise and to remain far above the 95% efficiency level set in the detector specifications, even at 2% noise.

Figure 5.8 and 5.10 demonstrate that the fake rate rises rapidly with an increasing fraction of above-threshold noise hits. This rise is explained by the increased probability of forming fakes when a higher fraction of strips are above threshold. It is clear that the maximum permissible noise will be determined by fake rates and not single track efficiency. For the standard definition of a fake track, the fake rate surpasses 1% with 1.5% above-threshold noise hits. This falls to around 0.9% when considering 2 GeV, 7 precision hit fakes.

In figures 5.11 and 5.12 the single muon reconstruction efficiency is plotted against the pseudorapidity of the reconstructed muon for standard and TDR cuts.

In figure 5.13 the effect of changing the lowest transverse momentum of 6 hits fakes looked for is shown. Again, most fakes have an energy <10 GeV.

Figure 5.14 shows the variation with d\({}_{0}\) of the 5GeV, 6 hits fake rates. The rates increase ap

proximately linearly until the iPatRec cutoff around d\({}_{0}\)=0.15.

#### Changing the SCT noise sigma

Figure 5.15 shows the effect on fake rates and efficiencies of increasing the SCT noise sigma whilst keeping the acceptance threshold fixed at 4\(\sigma_{N}\). The piled-up muon efficiencies are all 100%. The statistics for these points are too low to demonstrate the small drop in efficiency seen with the non-pile-up points for which a much larger sample was used. For the piled-up muons Clopper-Pearson 90% lower confidence limits of 0.992 for the 0 and 1000 electron points and 0.988 for the 2000, 3000 and 4000 electron points have been calculated.

Figure 5.15: The variation of efficiency and fake rates with the SCT noise sigma.

The variation of standard and TDR definition efficiencies with \(\sigma_{N}\) are shown in figure 18. Figure 18 shows 5 GeV and, where available, 2 GeV fake rates for tracks with minimums of 6 and 7 precision hits. Counter to expectations, the 5 GeV, 6 precision hit fake rate falls with increasing noise sigma. With the current statistics for the other fake rate data sets it is difficult to say whether this trend is repeated although none contradict the tendency to decrease. One explanation for this trend is that, as the acceptance threshold rises (since it is kept fixed at 4\(\sigma_{N}\)), low pulse height hits from the pile-up events are removed. There are then less above-threshold strips in the SCT which results in a lower probability of producing fakes.

Figure 19 shows the pulse heights (in electrons) of all hit SCT barrel strips in 10, piled-up, single muon events. The lower cut-off at approximately 4800 electrons and the upper limit of 88000 electrons are introduced during digitisation. All hits above 88000 e' are put in the highest bin during analogue to digital conversion1 resulting in the spike at 88000 e'. Average SCT barrel occupancies, found by applying various acceptance thresholds in figure 19, are shown in table 7. The occupancy is defined as the fraction of SCT barrel strips above the acceptance threshold. Increasing the threshold from the default value of 7500 to 16000 electrons reduces the occupancy due to pile-up by a factor of 1.6. Figure 11 shows that increasing the noise occupancy by a factor of 1.6, from 0.3% to 0.5%, results in a doubling of the fake rate. It is therefore not surprising that decreasing the pile-up occupancy by the same factor reduces the fake rate by a factor of 1.72

The decreasing fake rate means that the maximum threshold which can be set will be determined by the efficiencies. If the threshold is too high, many muon hits will fall below threshold, reducing the efficiency.

It can be seen that some lower pulse height muon hits are already being lost at a noise sigma of 4000e' by studying efficiency plotted against pseudorapidity in figures 5.19 and 5.20. Most of the efficiency lost in the 4000e' noise sample is at low and, to a lesser extent, high eta. This is explained by figure 5.21 which shows the lowest and next lowest thicknesses of silicon traversed by particles crossing the SCT at different pseudorapidities. The energy deposited and therefore the pulse height of a hit, is directly proportional to the path length of the particle in the silicon. At low and high eta particles pass through the barrel and endcap layers respectively almost perpendicular to the silicon, giving path lengths of around 300\(\upmu\)m. In between these two extremes the crossing angle is less than 90 degrees giving longer path lengths and higher pulse heights. The drop in efficiency at high eta is less marked because of an increased number of layers traversed (also shown in figure 5.21): The precision hit requirement in the definition of an accepted track is dominant (i.e. most tracks which are not accepted as efficient, have less than seven precision hits) and if more layers are crossed then the chance of accumulating 7 precision hits is increased. In order to maintain a good reconstruction efficiency across the whole pseudorapidity range of the Inner Detector, an SCT noise sigma less than 3000 electrons is needed.

### Distribution tails

The tail fractions in 1/_p\({}_{T}\)_ and _d\({}_{0}\)_ distribution have been studied for 20 GeV single muons without pile-up with different SCT noise and inefficiency. This study investigates whether degrading the SCT's performance affects the quality of the reconstructed tracks.

The tail fraction for _d\({}_{0}\)_ is defined as the fraction of tracks with \(\left|\mbox{$d_{0}$}\right\rangle\)(reconstructed)-d\({}_{0}\)(generated) \(>3\sigma(\mbox{$d_{0}$})\) with a similar definition giving the 1/_p\({}_{T}\)_ tail fraction. The \(\sigma(\mbox{$d_{0}$})\) and \(\sigma(\mbox{1/$p_{T}$})\) are found by fitting a Gaussian to the core of the distribution. The tail fraction of distributions are known to vary with pseudorapidity and are therefore studied as a function of eta. The tail fractions for two different samples of reconstructed muons tracks are considered: accepted tracks as defined by the standard efficiency cuts used in this report and by the TDR cuts.

In figures 24-39 the effects of degrading the SCT on the d\({}_{0}\) and 1/p\({}_{T}\) tail fractions are shown for 20 GeV (and in the case of increased inefficiency, also 200 GeV) muons. The tail fractions are all seen to be significantly greater than the 0.27% expected for perfect Gaussian distributions. This is because of multiple scattering which, due to some averaging in iPatRec of material distributions, is not always fully accounted for in pattern recognition. The tail fraction for the 200 GeV muons, which are less affected by multiple scattering than the 20GeV muons, are seen to be nearer the expected values.

A small increase in the 1/p\({}_{T}\) tail fraction for 200 GeV muons with increased inefficiency is observed for the standard muons sample (figure 30). In general however, it is seen that all three ways of increasing SCT noise and inefficiency have virtually no statistically significant effect on either the transverse momentum or impact parameter distribution tails.

dead readout chips, for example, which will result in more correlated, less random inefficiencies. One possible future study is of such correlated inefficiencies.

The maximum fraction of above-threshold noise SCT strips is bounded by the rising fake rates. For the standard fake track definition, a maximum noise of 1.5% can be tolerated.

For the studies of increasing the SCT noise sigma, the reconstruction efficiency was shown to provide the upper limit of around 3000 electrons. For larger \(\sigma_{N}\), reconstruction efficiency falls dramatically at the low and high extremes of pseudorapidity coverage.

The studies of distribution tails demonstrate that, for the ranges of noise and inefficiency studied, the quality of the reconstructed tracks is relatively unaffected.

Future possible studies include also varying pixel noise and inefficiency and using other types of performance measurements, such as b-tagging, to monitor the effects of degrading the Inner Detector.
