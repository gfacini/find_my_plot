## Introduction

The Barrel Toroid is the biggest part of the ATLAS superconducting magnet system. The toroid consists of 8 flat coils assembled radially and symmetrically around the beam axis. Each coil is contained in its own cryostat and supported to its vacuum vessel with a help of distributed sets of cold-to-warm rods and struts. The coils are indirectly cooled in parallel by a flow of liquid helium in pipes attached to the coil casings.

It is well known that superconducting magnet has an inherent phenomenon called quench - an abrupt and uncontrolled conductor's loss of superconductivity produced by a disturbance. The quench mechanism is considered in many sources, for instance [1,2]. The principal process of the quench is the transformation of the stored electromagnetic energy into the heat. The quench always starts at a point and then spreads through the magnet winding by a process of Joule heating and heat conduction. The initial point will have the highest temperature as it is subjected to ohmic heating for the longest time. The conductor zone irreversibly converts from the superconducting state to the normal (resistive) one. The scattered in the initial area heat causes warming up of the surrounding volumes, they quench in turn, resulting in a continuous expansion of the normal zone. The thermal conductivities of the materials determine the heat diffusion which governs the quench propagation.

As well as spreading along the conductor, the normal zone also expands in the directions perpendicular to the conductor resulting from the heat diffusion across the insulation. The velocity of the normal zone transverse propagation is much slower than the longitudinal velocity because the thermal conductivities are much less in the transverse direction.

High performance superconducting magnets must be equipped with quench protection. They have to be saved against permanent damage caused by overheating, overstressing and arcing that may result from a quench. The quench protection of the ATLAS Toroids will use small dump resistances and special quench heaters embedded into each double pancake of every coil [3].

In the event of quench, the coil and the casing temperatures will rapidly increase. The heat will be transferred to the cooling pipes and to the helium inside of them, the helium pressure will increase and a flow transient will take place.

### Computational Results

Appendix 1 presents the main results of the calculations. The graphs show the helium expulsion velocity, density, temperature, mass flow and pressure evolutions at the inlet (x=0 m), outlet (x=100 m) and in the middle (x=50 m) of the cooling circuit during a quench.

The maximum pressure excursion in the middle of the circuit is 3.1 bar, peaking at 6.9 sec after the beginning of the quench transient (fig. 6 presents a program page demonstrating pressure distribution along the cooling channel at the moment of the maximum pressure rise). The essential pressure rise begins at approx. 2.5 sec and ends at approx. 15 sec.

The graphs show that there will be no liquid helium in the cooling channels at approx. 11.5 sec after beginning of the quench transient.

A small difference in the jacket temperature values after 69 sec of a quench (39.2K instead of 43.3K) can be explained by the fact that for calculation of the heat input to the coil casing during a quench we used, as it was mentioned earlier, the heat capacity values of aluminium rather than the heat capacity values of the aluminium alloy 5083.

G1dp.tables consist all the graph information in a tabulated form.

The input data are shown on page 26, where

XLENGT [m] - total length of the cooling channel,

XBREFI [m] - beginning of the initial (t=0) refinement region,

XEREFI [m] - end of the initial (t=0) refinement region,

ICHFUN [-] - flag used to set the geometry of the helium channels as a function of position along the length:

(-1) - through external function,

AHEB [m\({}^{2}\)] - helium channel cross section,

IST [-] - stabilizer material:

IJK [-] - jacket material:

DHB [m] - hydraulic diameter of the helium channel,

AST [m\({}^{2}\)] - stabilizer cross section,

AJK [m\({}^{2}\)] - jacket cross section,

PHTJ [m] - heat transfer perimeter at the contact surface of the jacket and helium channel,

INTIAL [-] - flag used to specify the initial and boundary conditions for the transient:

(1) - inlet and outlet pressure and inlet temperature are given, the boundaries for the flow are at constant pressure and temperature,

(4) - initial pressure and temperature given, the boundary conditions are of closed inlet and outlet,

- 8 -

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:10]

PREINL [Pa] - helium pressure at the flow path inlet, PREOUT [Pa] - helium pressure at the flow path outlet, TEMINL [K] - helium temperature at the flow path inlet, IQFUN [-] - flag used to specify the heating input: (-1) - through external function, XQBEG [m] - beginning of the heated region, XQEND [m] - end of the heated region.

Page 27 contains the heat input data as a function of quench time ( see fig. 5 ) in a tabular form.

Page 28 presents tabular input data of the helium channel hydraulic diameters as a function of the channel parts position along the length.

Appendix 2 shows the major results of the calculation for a hypothetical case in the Barrel Toroid test facility. Fig.7 presents a schematic view of the cooling circuit. The inlet is formed by stainless tube, 30.5mm in inner diameter and 5m long. The outlet consists of 2 series-connected stainless steel tubes: the first one is the tube, 30.5mm in inner diameter and 1m long, the second one is the tube, 39.2mm in inner diameter and 4m long. We assumed that the nearest the magnet valves had been accidentally closed ( the boundary conditions are of closed inlet and outlet). In this case we have a pressure rise of 30 bar ( this value is an assumed allowable pressure for the thin flexible elements connecting the tubes) after approx. 21 sec of a quench.

In the program the heat transfer coefficient \(h\) is defined through the Nusselt number Nu as a function of the Reynolds and Prandtl numbers Re and Pr by Kraussold equation [8]:

\[\mathrm{Nu}=0.023\ \mathrm{Re}^{\ 0.8}\ \mathrm{Pr}^{\ 0.4} \tag{1}\]

where: the Nusselt number

\[\mathrm{Nu}=\mathrm{h}\ \mathrm{D_{h}}\ /\ \mathrm{k} \tag{2}\]

\[\mathrm{D_{h}}-\mathrm{hydraulic\ diameter},\]

\[\mathrm{k}-\mathrm{heat\ conductivity}.\]

The code performs the pressure drop calculation with the friction factor for smooth tubes according to the United States definition.

The friction factor definition is different between the US and Europe: in the US the pipe radius is used for the basic definition as in Europe - the pipe diameter; f\({}_{\mathrm{EU}}\) = 4f\({}_{\mathrm{US}}\)[9].
