###### Abstract

The ATLAS potential for the study of top quark properties and physics beyond the Standard Model in the top sector, is reviewed in this paper. Measurements of the top quark charge, the spin and spin correlations, the Standard Model decay (\(\mathrm{t\to bW}\)), rare top quark decays associated to flavour changing neutral currents (\(\mathrm{t\to qX,X=\gamma,Z,g}\)) and \(\mathrm{t\bar{t}}\) resonances are discussed. The expected sensitivity of the ATLAS experiment is estimated for an integrated luminosity of \(1\,\mathrm{fb^{-1}}\) at the LHC. For the Standard Model measurements the expected precision is presented. For the tests of physics beyond the Standard Model, the \(5\sigma\) discovery potential (in the presence of a signal) and the 95% confidence level limit (in the absence of a signal) are given.

Introduction

Several properties of the top quark have already been explored by the Tevatron experiments, such as the mass, charge and lifetime, the rare decays through flavour changing neutral currents (FCNC) and the production cross-sections. The structure of the Wtb vertex and the main top quark decay mode (\(\mathrm{t}\rightarrow\mathrm{b}\mathrm{W}\)) within the Standard Model were also investigated together with the measurements of the W-boson helicity fractions. Many of these studies were performed by reconstructing \(\mathrm{t}\overline{\mathrm{t}}\) pairs in the semileptonic, dileptonic and fully hadronic decay modes. Given the current Tevatron luminosity, most of these studies are limited by the statistics acquired.

The electric charge of the top quark is one of its fundamental properties and will be probed with high statistics at the LHC. The measurement of the top quark charge can be performed either by identifying the charge of its decay products in the main decay channel \(\mathrm{t}\rightarrow\mathrm{b}\mathrm{W}\) or by studying radiative top quark processes. At the Tevatron the D0 [1] and CDF [2] collaborations have already initiated the study of the top quark charge and, with the available statistics, they showed that the data gives preference to the Standard Model top quark hypothesis (with a charge of \(+2\)/3) over the scenario with an exotic quark (XM) of charge \(-4\)/3 and mass \(\approx 170\) GeV, fully consistent with the present precision electroweak data [3, 4]. The D0 and CDF exclude the exotic quark hypothesis with 92 and 87 % confidence, respectively.

As the top quark decays before it can form hadronic bound states, a consequence of its high mass, the spin information of the top quark is propagated to its decay products. This unique behaviour among quarks allows direct top quark spin studies, as spin properties are not washed out by hadronization. Through the measurement of the angular distributions of the decay products the information of the top quark spin can be reconstructed. Top quark spin polarization and correlations in \(\mathrm{t}\overline{\mathrm{t}}\) events produced at the LHC are precisely predicted by the Standard Model and are sensitive to the fundamental interactions involved in the top quark production and decay. By testing only the top quark decay, the W-boson polarization measurement complements top quark spin studies, helping to disentangle the origin of new physics, if observed. The W-boson polarization states can be measured through the longitudinal (\(F_{0}\)), left-handed (\(F_{\mathrm{L}}\)) and right-handed (\(F_{\mathrm{R}}\)) helicity fractions. At the present, the most stringent limits on the W-boson helicity fractions were obtained at the Run-II of the Tevatron [5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13]. Analysing 1.9 fb\({}^{-1}\) of data, the CDF experiment measured [5]\(F_{0}=0.62\pm 0.11\) with \(F_{\mathrm{R}}\) fixed to zero and \(F_{\mathrm{R}}=-0.04\pm 0.05\) with \(F_{0}\) fixed to the Standard Model expectation for \(m_{\mathrm{t}}=175\) GeV. For 2.7 fb\({}^{-1}\), the D0 experiment measured [10]\(F_{0}=0.490\pm 0.106(\mathrm{stat})\pm 0.085(\mathrm{syst})\) with \(F_{\mathrm{R}}\) fixed to zero, and \(F_{\mathrm{R}}=0.110\pm 0.059(\mathrm{stat})\pm 0.052(\mathrm{syst})\) with \(F_{0}\) fixed to the Standard Model value.

Within the Standard Model, the Wtb coupling is purely left-handed (at the tree level), and its size is given by the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) matrix element \(V_{\mathrm{tb}}\). In Standard Model extensions, departures from the Standard Model expectation \(V_{\mathrm{tb}}\simeq 0.999\)2 are possible [14, 15], as well as new radiative contributions to the Wtb vertex [16, 17]. These deviations might be observed in top quark production and decay processes at LHC. The most general Wtb vertex for on mass shell W-boson, top quark and b quark, containing terms up to dimension five can be written as

\[\mathcal{L} = -\frac{g}{\sqrt{2}}\bar{b}\,\gamma^{\mu}\left(V_{\mathrm{L}}P_{ \mathrm{L}}+V_{\mathrm{R}}P_{R}\right)t\;W^{-}_{\mu}-\frac{g}{\sqrt{2}}\bar{b }\,\frac{i\sigma^{\mu\nu}q_{\nu}}{M_{W}}\left(g_{\mathrm{L}}P_{\mathrm{L}}+g_{ \mathrm{R}}P_{R}\right)t\;W^{-}_{\mu}+\mathrm{h.c.}\,, \tag{1}\]

with \(q=p_{\mathrm{t}}-p_{\mathrm{b}}\) the W-boson momentum and \(P_{\mathrm{R(L)}}\) the chirality projectors. Additional \(\sigma^{\mu\nu}k_{\nu}\) and \(k^{\mu}\) terms, where \(k=p_{\mathrm{t}}+p_{\mathrm{b}}\), can be absorbed into this Lagrangian using Gordon identities. If the W-boson is on its mass shell or it couples to massless fermions \(q^{\mu}\varepsilon_{\mu}=0\), and terms proportional to \(q^{\mu}\) can be dropped from the effective vertex. The new constants \(V_{\mathrm{R}}\), \(g_{\mathrm{L}}\) and \(g_{\mathrm{R}}\)[18, 19], are vector like (\(V_{\mathrm{R}}\)) and tensor like (\(g_{\mathrm{L}}\) and \(g_{\mathrm{R}}\)) anomalous couplings, can be related to \(f_{1}^{\mathrm{R}}\), \(f_{2}^{\mathrm{L}}\) and \(f_{2}^{\mathrm{R}}\) in Ref. [20] (and references therein) as \(f_{1}^{\mathrm{R}}=V_{\mathrm{R}}\), \(f_{2}^{\mathrm{L}}=-g_{\mathrm{L}}\) and \(f_{2}^{\mathrm{R}}=-g_{\mathrm{R}}\). If we assume CP is conserved, these couplings can be taken to be real. Within the Standard Model \(\,V_{\rm L}\equiv V_{\rm tb}\simeq 0.999\) and the other couplings (\(V_{\rm R},\,g_{\rm L},\,g_{\rm R}\)) vanish at the tree level, while nonzero values are generated at higher orders [21, 22]. Indirect limits on the Wtb vertex anomalous couplings can be inferred from radiative B-meson decays and \(\rm B\bar{B}\) mixing [23]. Taking into account the current world average [23], \(\rm BR(\bar{B}\to X_{s}\gamma)=(3.55\pm 0.24^{+0.09}_{-0.10}\pm 0.03)\times 10^{-4}\), varying one parameter at a time, the 95% C.L. bounds on \(V_{\rm R}\), \(g_{\rm L}\) and \(g_{\rm R}\) are in the range \([-0.0007,0.0025]\), \([-0.0015,0.0004]\) and \([-0.15,0.57]\), respectively [22, 24].

Flavour Changing Neutral Currents are strongly suppressed in the Standard Model due to the Glashow-Iliopoulos-Maiani (GIM) mechanism [25]. Although absent at tree level, small FCNC contributions are expected at one-loop level, determined by the CKM mixing matrix [26, 27, 28, 29]. For the top quark within the framework of the Standard Model, these contributions limit the FCNC decay branching ratios to the gauge bosons, \(\rm BR(t\to qX,X=Z,\gamma,g)\), to below \(10^{-12}\). There are however extensions of the SM, like supersymmetry (SUSY) [30], multi-Higgs doublet models [31] and models with exotic (vector-like) quarks [32, 33, 34], which predict the presence of FCNC contributions already at tree level and significantly enhance the FCNC decay branching ratios compared to the Standard Model predictions [35, 36]. The branching ratio for the different models are shown in Table 1. FCNC processes associated with the production and decay of top quarks have been studied at colliders and the observed upper limits on the branching ratios at 95% C.L., from the direct searches, are shown in Table 2.

Since the top quark mass is much larger than the other quarks, the top quark may play a privileged role in the electroweak symmetry breaking (EWSB) mechanism. Any new physics connected to the EWSB could be preferentially coupled to the top quark sector. This would lead to deviations from the expected Standard Model \(\rm t\bar{t}\) production rate and could distort the top quark kinematics. New resonances and gauge bosons strongly coupled to the top quark are expected in a large variety of models, in particular those with strong EWSB [49, 50, 51]. The \(\rm t\bar{t}\) final states are also interesting for leptophobic \(\rm Z^{\prime}\) bosons which can appear in Grand Unification Models [52]. These new particles could reveal themselves in the \(\rm t\bar{t}\) invariant mass distribution. At the Tevatron experimental upper limits were set at 95 %C.L. for the \(\sigma(\rm p\bar{p}\to Z^{\prime})\times BR(Z^{\prime}\to t\bar{t})\) with \(\rm Z^{\prime}\) masses between 450 GeV and 900 GeV.

In this note the ATLAS potential for the study of the top quark properties and tests of physics beyond the Standard Model in the top quark sector are reviewed for an expected luminosity of 1 fb\({}^{-1}\) at the LHC. The note is organized as follows: the basic event selection and the trigger used are reminded in Section 2. In Sections 3, 4, 5 and 6 the studies of the top quark charge, the W-boson and top quark polarisation studies and the Wtb anomalous couplings, the top quark FCNC decays and the production of \(\mathrm{t}\bar{\mathrm{t}}\) resonances are discussed respectively. The summary and conclusions are presented in Section 7. The top quark mass, one of the most important top quark properties, is not investigated here as a separate note is devoted to this issue [54].

## 2 Basic event selection

As most of the studies performed in this paper are related to either the semileptonic (\(\mathrm{t}\bar{\mathrm{t}}\to\mathrm{W}\mathrm{W}\mathrm{b}\mathrm{b}\mathrm{ \overline{b}}\to\mathrm{l}\nu\mathrm{j}\,\mathrm{j}_{2}\mathrm{b}\mathrm{b} \mathrm{\overline{b}}\) with \(l=e,\mu\)) or the dileptonic (\(\mathrm{t}\bar{\mathrm{t}}\to\mathrm{W}\mathrm{W}\mathrm{b}\mathrm{b}\mathrm{ \overline{b}}\to\mathrm{l}\mathrm{l}\mathrm{l}^{\prime}\,\mathrm{\nu}\mathrm{b} \mathrm{\overline{b}}\) with \(\mathrm{l},\mathrm{l}^{\prime}=e,\mu\)) decays of \(\mathrm{t}\bar{\mathrm{t}}\) events, basic criteria for the event selection were defined for each one of these final state topologies. Changes to the criteria are to be expected depending on the type of top quark property under study. For the background studies several sources were considered, \(\mathrm{t}\bar{\mathrm{t}}\), \(\mathrm{W}+\mathrm{jets}\), \(\mathrm{W}\mathrm{b}\mathrm{b}+\mathrm{jets}\), \(\mathrm{W}\mathrm{c}\bar{\mathrm{c}}+\mathrm{jets}\), \(\mathrm{Z}+\mathrm{jets}\), \(\mathrm{W}\mathrm{W}\), \(\mathrm{Z}\mathrm{Z}\), \(\mathrm{W}\mathrm{Z}\) and single top events (see the introduction of the Top Chapter for a full list of backgrounds). The backgrounds are also described in more detail separatly for each section of the note. All signal and background events were required to pass the single lepton trigger requirements for electrons and muons. The triggers considered were L1_EM18I (L1_MU20,L1_MU40) for electrons (muons) at L1, e22i (mu20) for electrons (muons) at L2 and e22i (mu20) for electrons (muons) at the Event Filter (EF) [55].

Different selection criteria are applied for the top quark FCNC analyses, as the final state topology is different from those considered above. These criteria are explained in Section 5.

_Semileptonic topology_

In the semileptonic topology, signal events have a final state with one isolated lepton (electron or muon), at least four jets (two of them from the hadronization of b quarks and labelled b-jets) and large transverse missing energy from the undetected neutrino. More information on the signal can be found in the introduction of the Top Chapter. The basic selection criteria were defined by requiring that the events should have:

* exactly one isolated electron (muon) with \(|\eta|<2.5\) and \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>25\) GeV (\(p_{\mathrm{T}}>20\) GeV);
* at least 4 jets with \(|\eta|<2.5\) and \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>30\) GeV;
* at least 2 jets tagged as b-jets;
* missing transverse energy above 20 GeV.

_Dileptonic topology_

In the dileptonic topology, signal events have a final state with two isolated leptons (electrons and/or muons), at least two jets (tagged as b-jets) and large transverse missing energy from the two undetected neutrinos. The basic selection criteria were defined by requiring that the events should have:

* exactly two isolated electrons (muons) with \(|\eta|<2.5\) and \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>25\) GeV (\(p_{\mathrm{T}}>20\) GeV);* at least 2 jets with \(|\eta|<2.5\) and \(p_{\rm T}>\) 30 GeV;
* 2 jets tagged as b-jets;
* missing transverse energy above 30 GeV.

_Selection efficiency_

The efficiency of the basic selection criteria was examined using \(\approx\) 450 000 events from the \(\rm\bar{t}\to bWbW\to bqqb\ell\nu,b\ell\nu b\ell\nu\) signal sample. The results are presented in Table 3.

The effect of the trigger efficiency is investigated separately for the individual analysis.

## 3 Top quark charge reconstruction

There are several techniques to determine the electric charge of the top quark at hadron collider experiments [56, 57, 58]. The top quark charge measurement presented here is based on the reconstruction of the charges of the top quark decay products. As the dominant decay channel of the top quark is \(\rm t\to W^{+}b(\rm\bar{t}\to W^{-}\bar{b})\), the top quark charge determination requires the measurement of both the W boson and the b quark charges. While the charge of the W boson can be determined through its leptonic decay, the b quark charge is not directly measurable due to quark confinement in hadrons. In this note two possible ways to determine the b quark charge were investigated:

* The charge weighting technique: this approach is based on finding a correlation between the b quark charge and the charges of the tracks belonging to the b-jet [59, 60].
* The semileptonic b-decay approach: in this case the b quark charge is determined using the semileptonic b-decays (\(\rm b\to c,u+W^{-},W^{-}\to\ell^{-}+\bar{\nu}_{\ell}\)), where the sign of the soft lepton indicates the sign of the b quark charge.

Two major issues have to be addressed. The first one is to find the selection criteria to perform the correct pairing of the lepton and the b-jet originated in the same top quark decay. In the Standard Model a b-jet, coming from a b quark, should be associated with a positive lepton (\(\ell^{+}\)), while in the exotic case it should be associated with a negative one (\(\ell^{-}\)). The second issue is the assignment of a charge to the b-jet selected by the pairing criterion. While the former issue is common for both the approaches, the latter one is tackled in different ways.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|l|r|l|r|} \hline criterion & \(\epsilon\)(\%) & criterion & \(\epsilon\)(\%) \\ \hline Semileptonic events & 100 & Dileptonic events & 100 \\
1 isol.lept. (\(p_{\rm T}>\)25/20 GeV) & 58.9 & 2 isol.lept. (\(p_{\rm T}>\)25/20 GeV) & 35.5 \\ \(\geq\) 4 jets (\(p_{\rm T}>\)30 GeV) & 34.2 & \(\geq\) 2 jets (\(p_{\rm T}>\)30 GeV) & 31.8 \\ \(\geq\) 2 b-tagged & 10.5 & \(=\) 2 b-tagged & 8.3 \\ missing \(E_{\rm T}>\) 20 GeV & 8.5 & missing \(E_{\rm T}>\) 30 GeV & 6.5 \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}

### Event generation and selection

The standard \(\mathrm{t\bar{t}}\longrightarrow\mathrm{W^{+}bW^{-}\bar{b}}\) samples were used as signal events in both the semileptonic and the dileptonic channels (only electrons and muons are taken as signal). For the background studies, the \(W+\)jets sample was used. The \(\mathrm{t\bar{t}}\) all jets channels as well as the semileptonic and dileptonic channels of \(\tau\) leptons were analysed as they can contribute to background (all jets channel) and to signal (events with the leptonic decays of \(\tau\) leptons). In the present analysis the common selection criteria were used, as defined in Section 2. In addition, for each approach, specific criteria were applied to the events.

### The lepton and b-jet pairing algorithm

The lepton and b-jet pairing was done using the invariant mass distribution of the lepton and the b-tagged jet, \(m(\mathrm{l},\mathrm{b}_{\mathrm{jet}})\). If the assignment is correct, \(m(\mathrm{l},\mathrm{b}_{\mathrm{jet}})\) is limited by the top quark mass, otherwise there is no such restriction, as can been seen in Figure 1, where the signal sample with the standard cuts applied was analysed. To find the connection between the b-quarks and reconstructed b-jets and the parton level leptons and reconstructed leptons, the MC truth was used: the matching was treated as successful if the cone difference, \(\Delta R\) between b-quark and b-jet was less than 0.4 (in the lepton case \(\Delta R<0.2\)). For double b-tagged events, only the b-jets that satisfy

\[m(\mathrm{l},\mathrm{b}_{\mathrm{jet}}^{(1,2)})<m_{\mathrm{cr}}\quad\text{and} \quad m(\mathrm{l},\mathrm{b}_{\mathrm{jet}}^{(2,1)})>m_{\mathrm{cr}} \tag{2}\]

were accepted. In the di-lepton case both leptons should fulfill the condition (2). The optimal value for the pairing mass cut, \(m_{\mathrm{cr}}=155\) GeV, is a trade-off between the efficiency (\(\epsilon\)) and purity (\(P\)) of the pairing method. The factor \(\epsilon(2P-1)^{2}\) was maximised to find the optimum working point. As this criterion requires events with two b-tagged jets and one combination for the lepton and b-jet invariant mass must be below \(m_{\mathrm{cr}}\) and the other one above \(m_{\mathrm{cr}}\), the efficiency of the method is small. On the other hand, this criterion gives a high purity sample as is shown in Section 3.5.1. In the analysis two variants of b-tagged events treatment were considered. In the first one exactly two b-jets were required while in the second one two and more b-jets were allowed (the two with the highest \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) treated as true b-jets). Slightly better results were obtained for the former variant and the results presented here correspond to this case.

To suppress the background some additional cuts were tried: W boson mass (\(M_{\mathrm{W}}\)) window, top quark mass (\(m_{\mathrm{top}}\)) window, etc. By using the combined W boson and top quark mass window the background can be reduced by factor more than 10 at the expense of a factor 2 lo

Figure 1: Lepton - b-jet invariant mass spectra for the lepton and b-jet pairs from the same top quark (full line) and from different top quarks (dashed line).

window requires that at least one pair of non b-tagged jets should have an invariant mass within 10 GeV of the W boson mass. The \(m_{\rm top}\) window requires that the reconstructed W boson can be combined with a b-jet (not previously paired with a high-\(p_{\rm T}\) lepton) to give an invariant mass within 40 GeV of the top quark mass. This extra mass cut was applied by default in the whole top quark charge analysis using the weighting approach.

### The jet track charge weighting approach

The determination of the average b-jet charge was done using a weighting technique in which the b-jet charge is evaluated as the weighted sum of the b-jet track charges:

\[Q_{\rm bjet}=\frac{\sum_{i}q_{i}|\vec{j}_{i}\cdot\vec{p}_{i}|^{\kappa}}{\sum_{ i}|\vec{j}_{i}\cdot\vec{p}_{i}|^{\kappa}} \tag{3}\]

where \(q_{i}(p_{i})\) is the charge (momentum) of the \(i^{\rm th}\) track inside the jet and \(\vec{j}\) is the b-jet axis unit vector. The \(\kappa\) parameter was optimised for the best separation between b- and \(\bar{\rm b}\)-jets and the optimum value was found to be \(\kappa=0.5\). In addition, for the charge weighting technique, it was further required, using only tracks with \(p_{\rm T}>1.5\) GeV, that at least two tracks must be found within a cone with \(\Delta R<0.4\) with respect to the jet axis. For b-jets with more than seven such tracks, only the seven with the highest \(p_{\rm T}\) are used. The parameters of the weighting procedure are the result of a maximisation of the difference between the mean values of the b- and \(\bar{\rm b}\)-jet charge distributions - these mean values were found for a set of the parameters values (\(\kappa\) and track \(p_{\rm T}\)) and compared. For the procedure optimisation the signal \(\rm t\bar{t}\)-sample was used.

### Semileptonic b-decay approach

In this approach the pairing procedure described in Section 3.2 is also used. But in this case the b quark charge is determined through its semileptonic decay. The sign of the b-jet charge is determined by the lepton charge within the b-jet,

\[{\rm b}\rightarrow{\rm c},{\rm u}+\ell^{-}+\bar{\nu}\,\ \ \ \ \ \bar{\rm b} \rightarrow\bar{\rm c},\bar{\rm u}+\ell^{+}+\nu.\]

The lepton from the b-decay will be identified as a non-isolated lepton inside the corresponding b-jet, and its charge (\(Q_{\rm nonls}\)) defines the b quark charge. The non-isolated lepton is searched for among the tracks pointing to the treated b-jet and originating in the corresponding secondary vertex. Several processes can lead to an incorrect b quark charge assignment with this approach. Semileptonic decays of D mesons produced in the B decay chain, and the \({\rm B}^{0}\)-\(\bar{\rm B}^{0}\) mixing are examples of such processes. To suppress the contribution from D mesons, the non-isolated lepton transverse momentum with respect to the b-jet axis, \(p_{\rm T}^{\rm rel}\), can be used. The fact that the lepton \(p_{\rm T}^{\rm rel}\) from b-decays is, on average, higher than from D meson decays can be used to diminish this contamination. The \(p_{\rm T}^{\rm rel}\) cut was optimised using a sample of \(\approx 555000\) signal \(\rm t\bar{t}\) events and the value of 1 GeV has been found as the optimum cut. An additional source of wrong b quark charge assignments is mistagging, i.e. light jets incorrectly tagged as b-jets.

The main drawback of this approach is that, from all the selected lepton plus b-jet pairs, only those with a b-jet containing a non-isolated lepton can be used in the analysis. In addition to that, due to difficulties in selecting a pure sample of electrons from within jets, only muons were taken as the non-isolated leptons.

### Results

In both approaches, the Standard Model scenario of top quark production and decay is assumed. The corresponding results are discussed in the following sections.

#### 3.5.1 Weighting technique approach results

As a first step, the efficiency and purity of the lepton b-jet pairing was investigated. Using the events which passed the selection criteria, the obtained pairing efficiency is \(\epsilon=30.5\%\) and the pairing purity is \(P=85.6\%\). The purity of pairing is defined as \(P=N_{\rm good}/N_{\rm all}\), where \(N_{\rm good}\) (\(N_{\rm all}\)) is the number of correctly paired lepton - b-jet pairs (all treated pairs) and the Monte Carlo truth is used to find \(N_{\rm good}\).

The b-jet charge spectra reconstructed using the Monte Carlo truth and invariant mass pairing procedure for the signal \(\rm\bar{t}\bar{t}\) events are presented in Figure 2, left and right respectively. From Figure 2, the shift of the b-jet charges associated with \(\ell^{+}\), \(Q^{(+)}_{\rm bjet}\), and \(\ell^{-}\), \(Q^{(-)}_{\rm bjet}\), (or with b and \(\rm\bar{b}\) quark in the Monte Carlo case) is clearly seen. The obtained b-jet charge purity, defined as the percentage of b-jets with the correct charge (\(Q^{(+)}_{\rm bjet}<0\) and \(Q^{(-)}_{\rm bjet}>0\)), is \(P\approx 62\%\). In addition to that, the \(Q_{\rm comb}\) b-jet charge spectrum, defined as \(Q(\ell)\times Q^{(\ell)}_{\rm bjet}\), has been reconstructed. The influence of trigger was also investigated, namely the lepton level 1 and level 2 triggers as well as the event filter (EF). The results with and without trigger are summarised in Table 4. No significant impact of the trigger is observed. A small asymmetry in favour of the positive b-jet charge, as was revealed by the analysis, is due to the dominance of positive charge in the initial state (two colliding protons).

Note that the peaks at \(\pm 1\) in Fig. 2 correspond to the cases when all the tracks pointing to a b-jet have the same charge sign - in this case the weighting procedure (2) gives \(Q_{\rm bjet}=\pm 1\).

The main background processes for the top quark charge measurement in the semileptonic mode are: \(W+\) jets production (the most important background in this mode), QCD multi-jets, di-boson and single top quark production. The single top production is not a genuine background as it gives the same sign of the b-jet charge asymmetry as the signal. For the selection criteria that were used, the ratio of the accepted semileptonic \(\rm\bar{t}\bar{t}\) events to the accepted single lepton ones is more than 15:1.

processes and di-boson production [2].

The background studies for this analysis require large Monte Carlo samples (in addition to the standard cuts the invariant mass criterion is highly restrictive) not available at present. The ideal way to determine the basic background parameters, the S:B ratio and background charge asymmetry, is to use the W+jets (dominant background) samples. However, after applying the selection criteria to the available W+jets samples, only a few events remained (20 lepton b-jet pairs). It is clear that due to poor statistics the samples are not suitable for a valuable background analysis. Nonetheless, combining the b-jet charge spectra, obtained for the individual W+jets channels (W+n\(\times\)jets and Wb\(\bar{\rm b}\), Wc\(\bar{\rm c}\) + n \(\times\) jets) scaled according to their cross sections to 1 fb, a S:B ratio of \(\approx 38\)\(\pm\) 8 was obtained. To fix the S:B ratio we need to include other backgrounds and take a regard for the poor statistics. Taking into account only the standard cuts with a loose \(M_{\rm W}\) window (\(\pm 30\) GeV) a value of 7:1 was obtained for the S:B ratio which is compatible with that of the CDF background studies [2]. As a result, a nominal S:B ratio of 30:1 has been assumed, with 7:1 as a very conservative lower limit for studying systematic uncertainties related to the background.

The poor statistics of the available W+jets samples does not enable the background b-jet charge asymmetry to be determined precisely, the obtained value being \(\approx-0.02\pm 0.05\). On the other hand, as it was shown by CDF [2], no marked background asymmetry is expected. For this reason, as a background, we use the signal events but without the pairing of leptons and b-jets. As a consequence the obtained b-jet charge spectrum is not correlated with the high \(p_{\rm T}\) lepton charge and should not have any charge asymmetry. Assuming the nominal S:B ratio, the spectrum is normalized to 1/30 of the signal statistics. The analysis showed that this background exhibits practically no asymmetry. For the systematics studies, a background corresponding to S:B=7:1 was also considered.

To find a realistic b-jet charge distribution, the signal and background distributions are combined. In Figure 3 (left) the expected b-jet charge (\(Q_{\rm comb}\)) distribution combining the signal with the background (full line) and the background itself (dashed line) are shown. From the reconstructed b-jet charge spectra using the two treated backgrounds, the expected mean b-jet charge (assuming the Standard Model) is:

\[Q_{\rm comb}=-0.094\pm 0.0042\ ({\rm stat}).\]

The \(Q_{\rm comb}\) value is obtained as the mean value of the signal plus background (S+B) distribution combining signal with the background.

In conclusion, \(\approx 6000\)\(\ell\)b combinations could be selected for the top quark b-jet charge analysis, using the 1 fb\({}^{-1}\) sample. The expected combined b-jet charge purity, \(N(Q_{\rm bjet}<0)/N_{\rm all}\), is \(\approx 0.62\pm 0.01\) for the Standard Model case.

Figure 3: Left: the full S+B b-jet charge (\(Q_{\rm comb}\)) distribution (full line) and the background itself (dashed line); right: the reconstructed top quark charge (\(Q_{\rm t}^{\rm comb}\)) (full line) and its background (dashed line).

Taking into account the statistical uncertainty of the obtained mean b-jet charge (\(Q_{\rm comb}\)) it can be stated that the obtained value will differ from 0 by more than 20\(\sigma\). Using a simple statistical treatment it is easy to show that for a reliable determination of \(Q_{\rm comb}\) (\(\geq 5\sigma\)) a sample of \(\approx 0.1\) fb\({}^{-1}\) should be sufficient. In addition to that the analysis has revealed that the reconstructed b-jet charge is more influenced by the size of the S:B ratio than by the background asymmetry: going from the pure signal b-jet charge spectrum to that of the 7:1 mixture of signal and background, the mean b-jet charge decreased by 14%, while a replacement of the symmetric background by the asymmetric one with an asymmetry 1/4 of the signal one, leads to only 3% change of the charge at the 7:1 S:B ratio.

The direct reconstruction of the top quark charge can be done relying on the obtained value of \(Q_{\rm comb}\) (see above). Using the Standard Model value of the b quark charge (\(Q_{\rm b}=-1/3\)) and the mean reconstructed value of the b-jet charge (\(Q_{\rm comb}\)), the b-jet charge calibration coefficient \(C_{\rm b}=Q_{\rm b}/Q_{\rm comb}\) is \(3.54\pm 0.16\) and the top quark charge then reads:

\[Q_{\rm t}=Q(\ell^{+})+Q_{\rm bjet}^{(+)}\times C_{\rm b}\,,\ \ \ \ \ Q_{\rm\bar{t}}=Q(\ell^{-})+Q_{\rm bjet}^{(-)}\times C_{\rm b} \tag{4}\]

where \(Q(\ell^{\pm})=\pm 1\) is the lepton charge and \(Q_{\rm bjet}^{(\pm)}\) is as above.

The reconstructed top quark charge is shown in Figure 3 (right) for the sample of 1 fb\({}^{-1}\). The absolute value of top quark charge obtained by combining \(Q_{\rm t}\) and \(Q_{\rm\bar{t}}\) for the above mentioned sample is \(Q_{\rm t}^{\rm comb}=0.67\pm 0.06\ ({\rm stat})\pm 0.08\ ({\rm syst})\). The statistical error assumes that the relative error of \(C_{\rm b}\) is the same as that of \(Q_{\rm comb}\). The systematic error of \(Q_{\rm t}^{\rm comb}\) can be studied comprehensively only by using experimental data 3). In this case the main source of the systematic error is the weighting procedure that influences the coefficient \(C_{\rm b}\), that should be determined independently on the investigated b-jet charge, as well as the mean b-jet charge. In our case only the systematics stemming from determination of the mean b-jet charge were taken into account.

Footnote 3): The reconstructed b-jet charge or coefficient \(C_{\rm b}\) for an experimental sample, e.g. dijet b\(\bar{\rm b}\) data, should be compared with the corresponding Monte Carlo one to look for a possible difference in the b-jet track topology between Monte Carlo and real data.

#### 3.5.2 Semileptonic b-decay approach results

The charge of the non-isolated lepton found within the b-jet provides discrimination between the Standard Model and the exotic hypotheses on a statistical basis. Figure 4 shows the number of b-jets, which have been paired with positive (left) and negative (right) high \(p_{\rm T}\) lepton and which contain inside a non-isolated lepton, as a function of the charge (\(Q_{\rm nonls}\)) of the contained non-isolated lepton. The mean values of the non-isolated lepton charge obtained from these figures are:

\[\bar{Q}_{\rm nonls}^{(+)}=\frac{N(\ell^{+})-N(\ell^{-})}{N(\ell^{+})+N(\ell^{ -})}=-0.32\pm 0.05,\ \ \ \bar{Q}_{\rm nonls}^{(-)}=\frac{N(\ell^{+})-N(\ell^{-})}{N(\ell^{+})+N(\ell^{-} )}=0.30\pm 0.05,\]

where \(\bar{Q}_{\rm nonls}^{(+)}\) (\(\bar{Q}_{\rm nonls}^{(-)}\)) is the mean charge of the non-isolated leptons in the b-jets paired with the positive (negative) high \(p_{\rm T}\) lepton. \(N(\ell^{-})\) (\(N(\ell^{+})\)) is the number of b-jets with a negative (positive) charged lepton. The quantity \(Q(\ell)\times Q_{\rm nonls}^{(\ell)}\), where \(Q(\ell)\) is the charge of the lepton paired with the b-jet containing a non-isolated lepton, can be used to combine both histograms. The obtained mean combined charge in the Standard Model is \(\bar{Q}_{\rm nonls}^{(\rm comb)}=-0.31\pm 0.04\), showing a potential to distinguish between the Standard model and exotic hypothesis even with 1 fb\({}^{-1}\) of data, as in the case of the exotic scenario the opposite value of \(\bar{Q}_{\rm nonls}^{(\rm comb)}\) is expected.

### Systematic uncertainties

The systematic studies have been done following the prescription described in Section 6 of the Top Chapter introduction. The resulting systematic errors are summarised in Table 5. The systematic uncertainty caused by the top quark mass was estimated from the absolute difference between the \(Q_{\mathrm{comb}}\) reconstructed at the nominal value (175 GeV) and \(m_{\mathrm{t}}\)=160 and 190 GeV and rescaling to an effective 2 GeV uncertainty. The systematic uncertainty connected with the signal to background ratio was found assuming that this ratio is known with 30% uncertainty. The background asymmetry systematics was estimated assuming that the background charge spectrum asymmetry is at a level of 10% of the signal one.

The systematic uncertainties due to Monte Carlo modeling of \(\mathrm{t}\overline{\mathrm{t}}\) signal were studied by comparing samples with different fragmentation parameters: an AcerMC/Pythia sample and the standard signal MC@NLO/Herwig one, giving values of 18 \(\pm\) 13% and 16 \(\pm\) 13% for the weighting and semileptonic approaches, respectively. The large uncertainties are due to a limited Monte Carlo statistics, so these values cannot be considered as a reliable estimate of the corresponding systematic uncertainties and are therefore not included in Table 5.

Pileup background affects the weighting technique procedure, as tracks from additional minimum-bias interactions get included in the jet charges. The associated systematic uncertainty was evaluated by comparing the standard sample to a dedicated \(\mathrm{t}\overline{\mathrm{t}}\) sample including pileup, leading to a shift of 20\(\pm\)18%. Since the Monte Carlo statistical error is large, and it is expected that any pileup effect can be minimised (at least at moderate LHC luminosities) by applying track impact parameter cuts to eliminate tracks from pileup vertices, this value is also not included Table 5.

## 4 Polarization studies in \(\mathrm{t}\overline{\mathrm{t}}\) semileptonic events

The measurements of the W-boson and top quark polarizations in \(\mathrm{t}\overline{\mathrm{t}}\) events provide a powerful test of the top quark production and decay mechanisms and are a sensitive probe of new physics. W-boson or top quark spin information can be inferred from the angular distributions of the daughter particles in the W-boson or top quark rest frame, respectively. The W-boson can be produced with right, left or longitudinal polarizations, with corresponding partial widths \(\Gamma_{\mathrm{R}}\), \(\Gamma_{\mathrm{L}}\), \(\Gamma_{0}\) that depend on new anomalous couplings [61] (\(V_{\mathrm{R}}\), \(V_{\mathrm{L}}\), \(g_{\mathrm{L}}\) and \(g_{\mathrm{R}}\)) which can appear at the Wtb vertex (see Eq. 1).

Figure 4: Number of b-jets, containing a non-isolated lepton inside, associated with positive (left) and negative (right) high \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) lepton vs the charge of the non-isolated lepton. The contribution of different sources of leptons are marked by different shading styles.

### W-boson polarization and \(\rm t\bar{t}\) spin correlation measurements

The probability for the three helicity states of W-boson produced in top quark decay, \(F_{0}\) (longitudinal), \(F_{\rm L}\) (left-handed) and \(F_{\rm R}\) (right-handed), can be extracted from the \(\Psi\) angular distribution [61] :

\[\frac{1}{N}\frac{dN}{d\cos\Psi}=\frac{3}{2}\left[F_{0}\left(\frac{\sin\Psi}{ \sqrt{2}}\right)^{2}+F_{\rm L}\left(\frac{1-\cos\Psi}{2}\right)^{2}+F_{\rm R} \left(\frac{1+\cos\Psi}{2}\right)^{2}\right], \tag{5}\]

where \(\Psi\) is the angle between the W-boson direction in the top quark rest frame and the charged lepton direction in the W-boson rest frame obtained by a boost along the W-boson flying direction in the top quark rest frame. The correlation between the parameter couples (\(F_{0}\),\(F_{\rm L}\)), (\(F_{0}\),\(F_{\rm R}\)) and (\(F_{\rm L}\),\(F_{\rm R}\)) are -0.9, -0.8 and 0.4, respectively.

Although, in the Standard Model, top quarks are produced unpolarised in \(\rm t\bar{t}\) events, their spins are correlated [62]. The production asymmetry \(A\) in these events, measures the spin correlation and is defined as

\[A=\frac{\sigma(t_{\rm f}\bar{t}_{\uparrow})+\sigma(t_{\rm i}\bar{t}_{\downarrow })-\sigma(t_{\rm i}\bar{t}_{\downarrow})-\sigma(t_{\rm i}\bar{t}_{\uparrow}) }{\sigma(t_{\rm f}\bar{t}_{\uparrow})+\sigma(t_{\rm i}\bar{t}_{\downarrow})+ \sigma(t_{\rm i}\bar{t}_{\uparrow})}, \tag{6}\]

where \(\sigma(t_{\rm 1/\bar{1}}\bar{t}_{\rm 1/\bar{1}})\) denotes the production cross-section of a top quark pair with spins up or down with respect to a selected quantisation axis. It can be extracted from the \(\theta_{1}\) and \(\theta_{2}\) angular distributions [62]:

\[\frac{1}{N}\frac{d^{2}N}{d\cos\theta_{1}d\cos\theta_{2}}=\frac{1}{4}(1-A|\alpha _{1}\alpha_{2}|\cos\theta_{1}\cos\theta_{2}), \tag{7}\]

where \(\theta_{1}\) (\(\theta_{2}\)) is the angle between the \(\rm t\) (\(\rm\bar{t}\)) direction, measured in the \(\rm t\bar{t}\) rest frame, and the direction of the \(\rm t\) (\(\rm\bar{t}\)) decay product in the \(\rm t\) (\(\rm\bar{t}\)) rest frame obtained by a boost along \(\rm t\) (\(\rm\bar{t}\)) direction in the \(\rm t\bar{t}\) rest frame, \(\alpha_{i}\) is the spin analysing power of the top quark decay product \(i\), which ranges between \(-1\) and \(1\) and measures the degree to which its direction is correlated with the spin of the parent top quark. The parameter \(A_{\rm D}\) defined in [20], used to measure the production asymmetry in another basis, is extracted from the \(\Phi\) angular distribution [62] :

\[\frac{1}{N}\frac{dN}{d\cos\Phi}=\frac{1}{2}(1-A_{\rm D}|\alpha_{1}\alpha_{2}| \cos\Phi), \tag{8}\]

where \(\Phi\) is the angle between the direction of flight of the two spin analysers, defined in the t and \(\bar{\rm t}\) rest frames respectively.

The Standard Model predictions for the W-boson polarization (\(F_{0}\), \(F_{\rm L}\), \(F_{\rm R}\)), at next-to-leading order, and \(\bar{\rm t}\bar{\rm t}\) spin correlation (\(A\), \(A_{\rm D}\)), at leading order, are given in Table 6. The ATLAS sensitivity to these observables has been evaluated with an ATLFAST simulation [20] and a full simulation of a perfect detector [63]. A precision of 1% to 5% should be achievable with 10 fb\({}^{-1}\) of data, dominated by systematic uncertainties (in particular from the b-jet energy scale). This measurement requires a complete reconstruction of the \(\bar{\rm t}\bar{\rm t}\) system and a reliable Monte Carlo description to correct the distortion induced by trigger, cuts and reconstruction. In this section the robustness of the analysis with a realistic detector simulation including triggering is assessed. Only the semileptonic topology of the \(\bar{\rm t}\bar{\rm t}\) events (\(\bar{\rm t}\to{\rm W}{\rm W}{\rm b}\overline{\rm b}\to\ell\nu{\rm j}_{1}{\rm j}_ {2}{\rm b}\overline{\rm b}\) with \(\ell=e,\mu\)) is used as signal (an analysis using \(\bar{\rm t}\bar{\rm t}\) dilepton events as signal can improve the results of this study, especially for the \(\bar{\rm t}\bar{\rm t}\) spin correlation measurements). In this case the most powerful spin analysers of the top quark are the charged lepton (\(\alpha_{1}=1\)) and the least energetic non b-jet in the top quark rest frame (\(\alpha_{\rm jet}=0.51\)) [64], which are chosen afterwards for the spin correlation measurement.

#### 4.1.1 Event simulation and selection

The largest statistics Monte Carlo sample was generated with MC@NLO which does not implement \(\bar{\rm t}\bar{\rm t}\) spin corelations, so it can only be used to study W-boson polarisation. Spin correlations were studied using the smaller AcerMC sample. In both cases, non-semileptonic \(\bar{\rm t}\bar{\rm t}\), semileptonic \(\bar{\rm t}\bar{\rm t}\) which decay to \(\tau\), W-boson+jets and single top quark events were considered as background. Semileptonic signal events are characterised by one (and only one) isolated lepton, at least 4 jets, of which at least 2 jets are tagged as b-jets, and missing transverse energy. Following the common criteria for the semileptonic selection, all kinematic cuts are summarised in Table 7 together with the corresponding signal efficiencies.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c||c|c|} \hline \(F_{0}\) & \(F_{\rm L}\) & \(F_{\rm R}\) & \(A\)* & \(A_{\rm D}\)* \\ \hline

For \(A\) and \(A_{\rm D}\) the asterisk superscript means that \(m_{\bar{\rm t}}<550\) GeV is applied.

After kinematic cuts are applied, the event is fully reconstructed, as described below. The angles \(\Psi\), \(\theta_{1}\), \(\theta_{2}\) and \(\Phi\) are computed and the polarization parameters are extracted.

#### 4.1.2 W-boson and top quark reconstruction

The energies of all jets are calibrated according to the comparison with the energies of corresponding parton level quarks before selection and reconstruction. Then, in the event reconstruction, the light jet pair with invariant mass \(m_{\mathrm{jj}}\) closest to the known W-boson mass, \(m_{\mathrm{W}}\), is selected to reconstruct the W-boson which decays hadronically. This W-boson is then combined with one of the b-jets to reconstruct the top quark. As there are several possible combinations, the one which gives the mass closest to the top quark mass \(m_{\mathrm{t}}\) is assumed to be the correct one. The b-jet which is closest to the lepton in \(\Delta R\) among the remaining b-jets, is reserved for reconstructing the other top quark whose daughter W-boson decays leptonically. To reconstruct the W-boson which decays leptonically, the neutrino \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) is taken as the missing transverse energy. Its longitudinal component \(p_{\mathrm{z}}\) is determined by constraining \(m_{\mathrm{lv}}\) to \(m_{\mathrm{W}}\)[63]. When two solutions for \(p_{\mathrm{z}}\) are found, the one giving \(m_{\ell\nu\mathrm{b}}\) closer to \(m_{\mathrm{t}}\) is kept.

Quality cuts \(|m_{\mathrm{jjb}}-m_{\mathrm{t}}|<35\) GeV, \(|m_{\ell\nu\mathrm{b}}-m_{\mathrm{t}}|<35\) GeV and \(|m_{\mathrm{jj}}-m_{\mathrm{W}}|<20\) GeV are applied to reject badly reconstructed events. At this stage, 2.8% of the signal events are kept for MC@NLO events and 2.7% for AcerMC events, corresponding to 7000 signal events for 1 fb\({}^{-1}\) of data (Table 8). After this event selection, the main background comes from the \(\mathrm{t\bar{t}}\to\tau+\mathrm{X}\) events, where the tau decays to electron or muon. The number of events from W-boson+jets and single top quark channels is less than 3% of the selected number of signal events, so we neglect them in the following sections. Due to this cancellation of the background, the S/B ratio can be affected as much as 20%, which is taken as a systematic uncertainty (see Table 10).

After event reconstruction, the angle \(\Psi\) (W-boson polarization) as well as the angles \(\theta_{1}\), \(\theta_{2}\) and \(\Phi\) (\(\mathrm{t\bar{t}}\) spin correlations) are computed using the prescription descied at the beginning of Section 4. The measured distributions of \(\cos\Psi\), \(\cos\theta_{1}\times\cos\theta_{2}\) and \(\cos\Phi\) are distorted, compared with their distributions at parton level. The detector resolution results in much smaller smearing effect on the final particles than that coming from particle radiation, quark fragmentation-hadronization and final event reconstruction. That is to say, the latter effects dominate the resolution of the reconstructed objects from top quark decay [65]. A correction function, taken from the ATLFAST simulation, is used to recover the distributions at parton level. With ATLFAST data, the correction function is obtained from the ratio between the two normalized distributions of the \(\cos\Psi\) (i.e. after reconstruction of the signal and main background events and at parton level of the pure signal). To correct for the distortion, a weight derived from this function is applied on all the reconstructed \(\cos\Psi\) of full simulation, on an event by event basis, allowing to recover, as much as possible, the shape of the distribution of the \(\cos\Psi\) of the pure signal at parton level. A detailed description of the method can be found in [20].

#### 4.1.3 Impact of the trigger on the analysis

Semileptonic \(\mathrm{t\bar{t}}\) events are characterised by a single isolated lepton, which can be used to trigger the events with high efficiency. Applying the trigger selection to events passing the standard selection cuts, 15% of well reconstructed events are lost. The measurement results with and without trigger applied on the data, while keeping all other aspects of the measurement unchanged, were compared. The effect of the trigger on the measurements of the W-boson polarization is almost zero But the effect on the \(\mathrm{t\bar{t}}\) spin correlations is not negligible, and is taken as a systematic error, shown in Table 10.

#### 4.1.4 Measurement of the W-boson polarization

Figure 5 shows the correction function (left) and the reconstructed \(\cos\Psi\) distribution (right) after applying the correction function. This distribution is fitted to Eq. (5) varying \(F_{0}\), \(F_{\mathrm{L}}\) and \(F_{\mathrm{R}}\), but constrained by \(F_{0}+F_{\mathrm{L}}+F_{\mathrm{R}}=1\). The fit is restricted to the region \(-0.9<\cos\Psi<0.8\), which is the most extended region where the correction is varying slowly. The results are shown in Table 9.

Two complementary methods to extract the W-boson helicity fractions, using the observed angular distribution between the charged lepton direction in the W-boson rest frame and the W-boson direction in the top quark rest frame, are currently under development at ATLAS inspired on Tevatron methods [5, 66].

#### 4.1.5 Measurement of \(\mathrm{t\bar{t}}\) spin correlation

At parton level, before any phase space cut, the two estimators \(C=-9\times\cos\theta_{1}\cos\theta_{2}\) and \(D=-3\times\cos\Phi\) are unbiased [20]. Figure 6 shows the reconstructed distributions of \(-9\times\cos\theta_{1}\cos\theta_{2}/0.51\) and \(-3\times\cos\Phi/0.51\) after correction. It should be stressed that, in the evaluation of the \(\mathrm{t\bar{t}}\) spin correlation parameters, the theoretical value for the spin analyzing power for signal events (0.51) was assumed for both cases. The means of the distributions are unbiased estimators of \(A\) and \(A_{\mathrm{D}}\), provided corrections for physics effects and detector effects are fully carried out.

Figure 5: Left: Correction function taken from ATLFAST simulation fitted with a third order polynomial function. Right: Normalised reconstructed and corrected distribution of \(\cos\Psi\), the full line corresponds to the fit to Eq. (5). The sample has an integrated luminosity of 730 pb\({}^{-1}\).

This uncertainty reflects the different parametrizations of the Monte Carlo simulations. Preliminary studies suggest that this shift can be removed by using high statistics full simulation samples to derive the correction functions and for this reason this uncertainty was not included in Table 10.

#### 4.1.6 Systematic uncertainties

The systematic uncertainties were estimated with ATLFAST simulation for the factorisation scale, structure function, ISR, FSR, b-fragmentation, top quark mass, hadronization scheme and pile-up effects, and with full simulation for the b-tagging efficiency, b-jet energy scale, light jet energy scale and signal to background ratio (S/B scale) as listed in Table 10, for the measurement of the W-boson helicity fractions and top quark pair spin correlations respectively.

With data, \(\mathrm{t}\overline{\mathrm{t}}\) events can be reconstructed without requiring b-jet tagging on the side of top quark whose daughter W-boson decays leptonically. This can provide a pure sample of b-jets which can be used to check the uncertainty on the b-tagging efficiency [67]. The b-jet energy miscalibration can also be obtained from other control samples, such as Z+b-jet events [68].

### Anomalous couplings at the Wtb vertex

The W-boson polarisation is sensitive to new anomalous couplings (\(V_{\mathrm{L}}\), \(V_{\mathrm{R}}\), \(g_{\mathrm{L}}\) and \(g_{\mathrm{R}}\)) associated with the Wtb vertex. Although the W-boson helicity fractions (\(F_{0}\), \(F_{\mathrm{L}}\) and \(F_{\mathrm{R}}\)) depend on these couplings, the helicity ratios \(\rho_{\mathrm{R,L}}\equiv\Gamma_{\mathrm{R,L}}/\Gamma_{0}=F_{\mathrm{R,L}}/F_{0}\), were found to be more sensitive to \(V_{\mathrm{L}}\), \(V_{\mathrm{R}}\), \(g_{\mathrm{L}}\) and \(g_{\mathrm{R}}\). The

\(\rho_{\rm R}\) and \(\rho_{\rm L}\) observables are independent quantities and take the LO values \(\rho_{\rm R}=5.1\times 10^{-4}\), \(\rho_{\rm L}=0.423\) in the Standard Model. General expressions for \(\rho_{\rm R,L}\) in terms of the new anomalous couplings can be found in Ref. [19]. As for the helicity fractions, the measurement of helicity ratios sets bounds on \(V_{\rm R}\), \(g_{\rm L}\) and \(g_{\rm R}\). A third and simpler method to extract information about the Wtb vertex is through angular asymmetries involving the angle of the charged lepton in the W-boson rest frame and the W-boson direction in the top quark rest frame (introduced in the previous section). For any fixed \(z\) in the interval \([-1,+1]\), one can define asymmetries as the difference between the number of events above and below \(z\), normalised to the total number of events. The most obvious choice is \(z=0\), giving the forward-backward asymmetry \(A_{\rm FB}\)[18, 69]. The forward-backward asymmetry is related to the W-boson helicity fractions by \(A_{\rm FB}=\frac{3}{4}\left[F_{\rm R}-F_{\rm L}\right]\). Other convenient choices are \(z=\mp(2^{2/3}-1)\). Defining \(\beta=2^{1/3}-1\), we have \(A_{+}=3\beta[F_{0}+(1+\beta)F_{\rm R}]\) and \(A_{-}=-3\beta[F_{0}+(1+\beta)F_{\rm L}]\). Thus, \(A_{+}\) (\(A_{-}\)) only depend on \(F_{0}\) and \(F_{\rm R}\) (\(F_{\rm L}\)). The LO Standard Model values of these asymmetries are \(A_{\rm FB}=-0.223\), \(A_{+}=0.548\), \(A_{-}=-0.840\). They are sensitive to anomalous Wtb interactions, and their measurement allows to probe this vertex without the need of a fit to the distribution of the angle between the charged lepton direction in the W-boson rest frame and the W-boson direction in the top quark rest frame. In the present analysis the ATLAS sensitivity to the \(\rho_{\rm L}\), \(\rho_{\rm R}\), \(A_{\rm FB}\), \(A_{+}\) and \(A_{-}\) observables is studied.

#### 4.2.1 Event selection

In this section an alternative two-level likelihood analysis is explored for the semileptonic channel, i.e. \(\mathrm{\tilde{t}}\to\mathrm{W^{+}bW^{-}\bar{b}}\) where one of the W-bosons decays hadronically and the other one decays in the leptonic channel \(\mathrm{W}\to\ell\nu_{\ell}\) (with \(\ell=\mathrm{e},\mu\)). Any other process constitutes a background to this signal. In particular, it should be noticed that the fully hadronic, dileptonic and semileptonic (with one of the W-bosons decaying into \(\tau\nu\)) \(\mathrm{\tilde{t}}\) channels are considered backgrounds to the present analysis. Additionally, the following Standard Model processes were considered as background: single top production, \(\mathrm{W+jets}\), \(\mathrm{Wb\bar{b}+jets}\), \(\mathrm{Wc\bar{c}+jets}\), \(\mathrm{Z}\to\mathrm{e^{+}e^{-}}\), \(\mathrm{Z}\to\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\), \(\mathrm{Z}\to\tau^{+}\tau^{-}\), WW, ZZ and WZ. The likelihood analysis is based on the construction of a discriminant variable which uses distributions of some kinematical properties of the events. In the first analysis level (called the pre-selection), the common selection criteria

for the semileptonic topology, with the exception of the b-tagging requirement on jets, was applied to the event. The full event reconstruction was performed using a \(\chi^{2}\), defined by

\[\chi^{2}=\frac{(m_{\ell\nu\mathrm{j_{a}}}-m_{\mathrm{t}})^{2}}{\sigma_{\mathrm{t} }^{2}}+\frac{(m_{\mathrm{j_{b}}\mathrm{j_{c}}\mathrm{j_{d}}}-m_{\mathrm{t}})^{2 }}{\sigma_{\mathrm{t}}^{2}}+\frac{(m_{\ell\nu}-m_{\mathrm{W}})^{2}}{\sigma_{ \mathrm{W}}^{2}}+\frac{(m_{\mathrm{j_{c}}\mathrm{j_{d}}}-m_{\mathrm{W}})^{2}}{ \sigma_{\mathrm{W}}^{2}}\;, \tag{9}\]

where \(m_{\mathrm{t}}=175\) GeV, \(m_{\mathrm{W}}=80.4\) GeV, \(\sigma_{\mathrm{t}}=14\) GeV and \(\sigma_{\mathrm{W}}=10\) GeV are the expected top quark and W-boson mass resolutions4), \(\ell\) represents the selected electron or muon, \(m_{\ell\nu}\) is the invariant mass of the electron (muon) and the neutrino, and \(j_{\mathrm{a,b,c,d}}\) corresponds to all the possible combinations among the four jets with highest \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) (with \(m_{\ell\nu\mathrm{j_{a}}}\), \(m_{\mathrm{j_{b}}\mathrm{j_{c}}\mathrm{j_{d}}}\) and \(m_{\mathrm{j_{c}}\mathrm{j_{d}}}\) being the corresponding invariant masses). The neutrino was reconstructed using the missing transverse energy and allowing the \(p_{z}^{\nu}\) to vary in the range \([-500,+500]\) GeV. The solution corresponding to the minimum \(\chi^{2}\) was chosen. The jets used to reconstruct the hadronic W-boson will be labelled "non-b" jets and the remaining two are labelled "b-jets". It should be stressed that no b-tagging information was used so far. The pre-selection was completed by requiring \(\chi^{2}<16\). In the second level (the final selection), signal and background-like probabilities were constructed for each event (\(\mathcal{P}_{i}^{\mathrm{signal}}\) and \(\mathcal{P}_{i}^{\mathrm{back.}}\), respectively) using probability density functions (p.d.f.) built from relevant physical variables: the cosine of the angle between the leptonic top quark and the leptonic "b-jet", the transverse momentum of the hadronic W, the hadronic and leptonic top quark masses, the transverse momentum of the two "b-jets", the transverse momentum of the lepton and the \(\sqrt{\chi^{2}}\) distribution. It should be stressed that the objective is to test the sensitivity for new physics exclusion, under the hypothesis that the Standard Model holds, and the simulation was done assuming no anomalous couplings. Signal (\(\mathcal{L}_{S}=\Pi_{i=1}^{n}\mathcal{P}_{i}^{signal}\)) and background (\(\mathcal{L}_{B}=\Pi_{i=1}^{n}\mathcal{P}_{i}^{back.}\)) likelihoods (with \(n=8\), the number of p.d.f.) are used to define a discriminant variable \(L_{\mathrm{R}}=\log_{10}(\mathcal{L}_{S}/\mathcal{L}_{B})\). The distribution of this variable is shown in Figure 7(a). The final event selection is done by applying the cut \(L_{\mathrm{R}}>0.1\) on the discriminant variable. The number of signal and background events (normalised to \(L=1\) fb\({}^{-1}\)) after the pre-selection and final selection are shown in Table 11. After the final selection (including the trigger), the dominant backgrounds are W+jets and semileptonic \(\mathrm{t\bar{t}}\) with taus in the final state (corresponding to 49%, and 29% of the total background, respectively, as shown in Table 12).

Footnote 4: These resolutions are taken from the top quark mass measurement analyses [70]. It should be noticed that \(\sigma_{\mathrm{t}}\) and \(\sigma_{\mathrm{W}}\) can be interpreted as weights for each term of the \(\chi^{2}\) definition. By changing their values by a factor \(\sim 2\), the obtained observables (\(\rho_{\mathrm{L}}\), \(\rho_{\mathrm{R}}A_{+}\) and \(A_{-}\)) are the same within the statistical error.

The effect of the single lepton trigger on the event selection was studied. The results are summarised in Table 11. In what follows, only events passing the trigger are considered.

Once b-tagging is well understood, additional information can be used. In this case only jets with a positive b-tagging weight were considered as "b-jet" candidates for the \(\chi^{2}\) minimisation method. In

The effect of the trigger on the event selection is also shown.

addition, the b-tagging weights of these jets were considered as p.d.f.s for the discriminant variable evaluation. In this case, the number of selected signal and background events for \(L=1\) fb\({}^{-1}\) is expected to be \((6.6\pm 0.1)\times 10^{3}\) and \((0.9\pm 0.1)\times 10^{3}\), respectively. The \(\mathrm{t\overline{t}}\) background is expected to be dominant (72% of the total background, mainly due to the semileptonic channel with taus in the final state) and the W+jets and single top processes correspond to 15% and 13% of the total background, respectively. The discriminant variables corresponding to the analysis with and without b-tagging are shown in Figure 7.

#### 4.2.2 Measurement of the angular distribution and asymmetries

The experimentally observed angular distribution, which includes the \(\mathrm{t\overline{t}}\) signal as well as the Standard Model background, is affected by detector resolution, \(\mathrm{t\overline{t}}\) reconstruction and selection criteria [71]. In order to recover the Standard Model distribution, it is necessary to subtract the background and correct for the effects of the detector, event selection and reconstruction. For this purpose, two different sets of signal and background event samples were used: one "experimental" set, which simulates a possible experimental result, and one "reference" set, which is used to parametrise the effects mentioned, and correct the previous sample. The procedure is as follows. After subtracting reference background samples, the full "experimental" distribution is multiplied by a correction function \(f_{c}\) in order to recover the Standard Model one. This correction function is determined by assuming that the charged lepton distribution corresponds to the Standard Model. In case that a deviation from Standard Model predictions (corre

sponding to anomalous couplings) is found, the correction function must be modified accordingly, and the expected distribution recalculated in an iterative process. These issues have been analysed in detail in Ref. [20], where it was shown that this process quickly converges. The correction function is calculated, for each bin of the angular distribution, by dividing the number of generated events by the number of selected events, using the reference sample. In order to avoid non-physical fluctuations due to the limited amount of Monte Carlo statistics, a smoothing procedure was applied to the obtained correction function. The value of \(f_{c}\) is in the range [0.2,1.4]. Other methods of correcting the angular distribution are under investigation.

The procedure of correcting for detector and reconstruction effects in the asymmetries is similar to that used with the full angular distribution, but using only two or three bins. This has the advantage that the asymmetry measurements are less sensitive to the extreme values of the angular distributions, where correction functions deviate from unity. Moreover, it should be noticed that the extreme bins of the angular distribution have a very significant impact on the measurement of the \(\rho_{\rm L}\) and \(\rho_{\rm R}\) helicity ratios. The values obtained from a fit to the corrected distribution, as well as the angular asymmetries \(A_{\rm FB},A_{\pm}\), are collected in Table 13, with their statistical uncertainties. Although the statistical errors of the observables obtained for the analyses without and with b-tagging are similar, the use of this tool allows to improve the signal to background ratio, leading to smaller systematic uncertainties, as discussed below.

#### 4.2.3 Systematic uncertainties

The study of the systematic uncertainties considered possible errors from different sources: jet energy scale, luminosity, top quark mass, background level, ISR and FSR, Monte Carlo generator and pile-up. The jet calibration used in the present analyses is described in Ref. [70]. As for the reference analyses, full simulation Monte Carlo samples were used for the study of all the systematic sources of uncertainty. Only the simulated sample used as the "experimental" set (which fakes the data) was changed for each systematic source of uncertainty. The correction function and the Monte Carlo sample used to perform the background subtraction were kept unchanged. The impact on the measurements is summarised in Tables 14 and 15. As the background subtraction is based on Monte Carlo simulation, the background estimation required a luminosity value and therefore the corresponding systematic uncertainty was considered. Once the cross-sections for known backgrounds are measured with data, a data-driven normalisation will be possible and the luminosity systematic error should be reduced. Moreover, with data it will be possible to compare the discriminant variable distributions for selected events obtained from data and Monte Carlo. This comparison will allow the correction of systematic uncertainties caused by inaccurate description of data by the Monte Carlo simulation.

#### 4.2.4 Constraints on the anomalous couplings

Using the parametric dependence of the observables on \(V_{\rm R}\), \(g_{\rm L}\) and \(g_{\rm R}\) (and considering the correlations between them, which are shown in Table 16), constraints can be set on the anomalous couplings. The helicity ratios \(\rho_{\rm R,L}\) and the asymmetries \(A_{\pm}\) were used as input for the program TopFit[19]. The expected 68% CL allowed regions on the Wtb anomalous couplings for \(L=1\)\({\rm fb}^{-1}\) (analyses with and without b-tagging) are shown in Figure 8. In addition to the allowed regions of Figure 8, additional solutions can be found at \(g_{\rm R}\sim 0.8\). Such solutions are due to a large cancellation between \({\cal O}(g_{\rm R})\) and \({\cal O}(g_{\rm R}{}^{2})\) terms and can be excluded by the measurement at the LHC of the single top cross-section [72].

## 5 Rare Top Quark Decays and FCNC

This section discusses the study of rare top quark decays via FCNC (\(\rm t\to qX,X=\gamma,Z,g\)) using \(\rm t\bar{t}\) events produced at the LHC. These decays are strongly suppressed in the Standard Model at tree level due to the GIM mechanism. In the effective Lagrangian approach [73, 74] the new top quark decay rates to the gauge bosons can be expressed in terms of the \(\kappa_{\rm tq}^{g}\), \(\kappa_{\rm tq}^{\gamma}\), (\(|\nu_{\rm tq}^{Z}|^{2}+|a_{\rm tq}^{Z}|^{2}\)) and \(\kappa_{\rm tq}^{Z}\) anomalous couplings to the g, \(\gamma\) and Z bosons respectively, and \(\Lambda\), the energy scale associated with the new physics.

### Event samples

The signal event samples used in this analysis correspond to \(\mathrm{t\bar{t}}\rightarrow\mathrm{b}\ell\nu\mathrm{q}\mathrm{X}\), where \(\mathrm{X}=\gamma,\mathrm{Z}\rightarrow\ell\ell,\mathrm{g}\) and \(\ell=\mathrm{e},\mu\). The following common Standard Model samples were considered as background: fully hadronic, fully leptonic and semi-leptonic \(\mathrm{t\bar{t}}\), all from MC@NLO; Wt, \(s\)- and \(t\)- channels of single top production, all from AcerMC; \(\mathrm{W}+\)jets, \(\mathrm{Wb\bar{b}}+\)jets and \(\mathrm{Wc\bar{c}}+\)jets, all from ALPGEN; \(\mathrm{Z}\rightarrow\mathrm{e^{+}e^{-}}\), \(\mathrm{Z}\rightarrow\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\) and \(\mathrm{Z}\rightarrow\tau^{+}\tau^{-}\), all from PYTHIA; WW, ZZ and WZ, all from HERWIG.

### Event selection

The \(\mathrm{t\bar{t}}\) final states corresponding to the different FCNC top quark decay modes lead to different topologies according to the number of jets, leptons and photons. There is however a common characteristic of all channels under study, _i.e._ in all of them one of the top quarks is assumed to decay through the dominant Standard Model decay mode \(\mathrm{t}\rightarrow\mathrm{bW}\) and the other is forced to decay via one of the FCNC modes \(\mathrm{t}\rightarrow\mathrm{qZ}\), \(\mathrm{t}\rightarrow\mathrm{q\gamma}\) or \(\mathrm{t}\rightarrow\mathrm{qg}\). The QCD backgrounds at hadron colliders make the search for the signal via the fully hadronic channels (when the W and the Z bosons decay to quarks) difficult. For this reason only the leptonic decays of both W and Z to e and \(\mu\) were taken into account. Only isolated muons, electrons and photons separated by \(\Delta R>0.4\) from other reconstructed objects, were considered. Specific pre-selection and selection cuts were applied for each FCNC channel, as outlined in Table 17.

For the \(\mathrm{t}\rightarrow\mathrm{q\gamma}\) channel, exactly one reconstructed lepton and one reconstructed photon where required in the events. Additionally, at least two jets were required. For the \(\mathrm{t}\rightarrow\mathrm{qg}\) channel, the events had to have exactly one reconstructed lepton, three jets and no reconstructed photon. Finally, for the \(\mathrm{t}\rightarrow\mathrm{qZ}\) channel, only the events with at least two jets, exactly three reconstructed leptons and no reconstructed photons were accepted. Therefore, the selection criteria for these channels are orthogonal. The expected number

of background events and signal efficiencies after the final selection are shown in Table 19. The effect of the trigger on the background and signal events, after all the other cuts, is shown in Table 18. It should be noticed that the events of the \(\mathrm{t}\to\mathrm{q}\gamma\) (\(\mathrm{t}\to\mathrm{q}\mathrm{Z}\)) channel can be triggered by the lepton or the photon (one of the three leptons), which results on higher trigger efficiencies, when compared with the \(\mathrm{t}\to\mathrm{q}\mathrm{g}\) channel with just one lepton. For the \(\mathrm{t}\to\mathrm{q}\gamma\) channel, the dominant backgrounds are \(\mathrm{t}\bar{\mathrm{t}}\), \(\mathrm{Z}+\mathrm{jets}\) and \(\mathrm{W}+\mathrm{jets}\) events, which correspond to 38%, 30% and 29% of the total background. The total background for the \(\mathrm{t}\to\mathrm{q}\mathrm{Z}\) channel is mainly composed of \(\mathrm{t}\bar{\mathrm{t}}\) and \(\mathrm{Z}+\mathrm{jets}\) events (59% and 28% of the total background, respectively), while for the \(\mathrm{t}\to\mathrm{q}\mathrm{g}\) it is mainly composed of \(\mathrm{W}+\mathrm{jets}\) and \(\mathrm{t}\bar{\mathrm{t}}\) events (which correspond, respectively, to 64% and 25% of the total background).

For all the channels, the top quark with Standard Model semileptonic decay (\(\mathrm{t}\to\mathrm{b}\ell\nu\)) cannot be directly reconstructed due to the presence of an undetected neutrino in the final state. The neutrino four-momentum was estimated with a method similar to the one used in Section 4.2, by finding the \(p_{Z}^{\nu}\) value and the jet combination (and the lepton combination in the case of the \(\mathrm{q}\mathrm{Z}\) topology) which minimizes the following expression:

\[\chi^{2}=\frac{\left(m_{\mathrm{t}}^{\mathrm{FCNC}}-m_{\mathrm{t}}\right)^{2}} {\sigma_{\mathrm{t}}^{2}}+\frac{\left(m_{\ell_{a}\nu j}-m_{\mathrm{t}}\right)^ {2}}{\sigma_{\mathrm{t}}^{2}}+\frac{\left(m_{\ell_{a}\nu}-m_{\mathrm{W}}\right) ^{2}}{\sigma_{\mathrm{W}}^{2}}+\frac{\left(m_{\ell_{b}\ell_{c}}-m_{\mathrm{Z} }\right)^{2}}{\sigma_{\mathrm{Z}}^{2}}, \tag{10}\]

3 GeV5). No b-tag information was used to reconstruct the event kinematics. The jet chosen to reconstruct the top quark with Standard Model decay is labeled as b quark. For the \(\mathrm{t}\to\mathrm{q}\gamma\) and the \(\mathrm{t}\to\mathrm{q}\mathrm{Z}\) channels, the other jet, which was used to reconstruct the top quark with FCNC decay, is denoted by q quark. For the \(\mathrm{t}\to\mathrm{q}\mathrm{g}\) channel, it is assumed that the jet created by the gluon is the most energetic from the two which reconstruct the top quark with FCNC decay and the other is created by the light quark.

Footnote 5: These resolutions are taken from the top quark mass measurement analyses [70]. The effect of changing their values was considered as one of the systematic source of uncertainties. Its impact on the observables is below the statistical error.

Following the selection cuts, a likelihood-based type of analysis was applied, as described in section 4.2. Due to the small statistics of the available full simulation samples, ATLFAST samples were used to obtain the probability density functions (p.d.f.s). The p.d.f.s of the \(\mathrm{t}\to\mathrm{q}\gamma\) channel were built based on the following variables: the mass of the top quark with FCNC decay (\(m_{\mathrm{t}}^{\mathrm{FCNC}}\)); the reconstructed mass of the photon and the b quark (\(m_{\mathrm{b}\gamma}\)) and the transverse momentum of the leading photon (\(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\gamma}\)). For the \(\mathrm{t}\to\mathrm{q}\mathrm{Z}\) channel, the p.d.f.s were based on the following physical distributions: the mass of the top quark with FCNC decay (\(m_{\mathrm{t}}^{\mathrm{FCNC}}\)); the minimum invariant mass of the three possible combinations of two leptons (\(m_{\ell\ell}^{\mathrm{min}}\)); the reconstructed mass of the Z and the b quark (\(m_{\mathrm{bZ}}\)); the reconstructed mass of the two quarks (\(m_{\mathrm{qb}}\)); the transverse momentum of the third lepton (\(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\ell_{3}}\)) and the transverse momentum of the light quark (\(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\ell_{3}}\)). The following variables were used to build the p.d.f.s of the \(\mathrm{t}\to\mathrm{q}\mathrm{g}\) channel: the mass of the top quark with FCNC decay (\(m_{\mathrm{t}}^{\mathrm{FCNC}}\)); the mass of the top quark with Standard Model decay (\(m_{\ell_{\mathrm{e}}\nu_{j}}\)); the reconstructed mass of the light and the b quark (\(m_{\mathrm{qb}}\)); the transverse momentum of the b quark (\(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{b}}\)); the transverse momentum of the light quark (\(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{q}}\)) and the angle between the lepton and the gluon (\(\alpha_{\ell_{\mathrm{g}}}\)). The distributions of the discriminant variables are presented in Figure 9. It can be seen that ATLFAST describes the fully simulated distributions fairly well, when there are sufficient statistics to tell.

### Results and systematic uncertainties

In the absence of a FCNC top quark decay signal, expected limits at 95% CL were derived using the modified frequentist likelihood method [75] and the discriminant variables obtained with the full simulation samples. No cuts on the discriminant variables were used. Using the Standard Model \(\mathrm{t}\bar{\mathrm{t}}\) production cross-section these limits were converted into limits on the branching ratios. The central values of these limits are shown in Table 20. The branching ratio sensitivity for each FCNC channel, assuming a sig

methods are currently under investigation to study the production of high mass resonances (\(m>2\) TeV), where the decay products of the top quark are close together, so requiring a modified selection.

### Event generation and selection

In this study, \(\mathrm{t\bar{t}}\) resonances were produced with Pythia. The \(\mathrm{Z^{\prime}}\rightarrow\mathrm{t\bar{t}}\) channel without interference in the \(\mathrm{Z^{\prime}}\) production has been chosen [77]. Only the semileptonic decay (electrons and muons) of \(\mathrm{t\bar{t}}\) pairs is considered. Five samples of \(\mathrm{Z^{\prime}}\) resonances with mass 700 GeV (the lower limit from CDF and D0 measurements [78, 79]), 1000 GeV, 1500 GeV, 2000 GeV and finally 3000 GeV have been produced.

The common \(\mathrm{t\bar{t}}\) semileptonic selection criteria were used to accept signal events. Once these criteria are applied, the main source of physical background to be considered in the search for \(\mathrm{t\bar{t}}\) resonances comes from Standard Model \(\mathrm{t\bar{t}}\) events. The other sources of background, dominated by W+jets events, are negligible [54].

### Data characteristics

#### 6.2.1 \(\mathrm{t\bar{t}}\) reconstruction

Several ways to reconstruct the W-bosons and the top quarks have been investigated [54]. The simplest of them is used here. This method selects, among all jets from light quarks (u,d,c and s), the two jets which are closest in \(\Delta R\) to build the hadronic W-boson. The hadronic top quark is reconstructed combining the nearest b-jet to the hadronic W-boson. For the leptonic side, the constraint on the W-boson mass is used to compute the longitudinal momentum of the neutrino, identifying the missing transverse energy as the neutrino transverse momentum. Among the 2 \(p_{x^{\nu}}\) solutions, the one providing the leptonic top quark mass closest to the mean value of the hadronic top quark mass is chosen. To reduce both the physical background and the combinatorial background (which dominates), cuts are applied on the hadronic W-boson mass spectrum, and on both top quark mass spectra. The resulting \(\mathrm{t\bar{t}}\) mass distribution, given in Figure 11, is used as a starting point for the discovery potential determination.

This method does not need a well understood jet energy scale and it is also one of the most efficient. More sophisticated methods to select the top quarks, such as a kinematic fits of the \(\mathrm{t\bar{t}}\)-pairs (used by the D0 experiment [79]), or a matrix-element motivated method (used by CDF [78]), are not described here. The method used could be considered as a baseline for the \(\mathrm{t\bar{t}}\) resonance search.

#### 6.2.2 Event yield

The reconstruction efficiency of Standard Model \(\mathrm{t\bar{t}}\) pairs corresponding to the reconstruction scheme and cuts described above is shown in Figure 13. The fact that the produced particles are closer together when the generated \(\mathrm{t\bar{t}}\) mass is higher explains the drop of efficiency observed as a function of the \(\mathrm{t\bar{t}}\) mass. Part of the efficiency can be recovered if another jet finding algorithm, better at resolving nearby jets (such as a cone jet algorithm with smaller cone radius), is used.

Figure 14 gives the reconstruction efficiency of \(\mathrm{Z^{\prime}}\) resonances as a function of their mass. This reconstruction efficiency is of the same order as for the Standard Model \(\mathrm{t\bar{t}}\) pairs. Nevertheless, some small differences arise due to the different production mechanism and spin. Thus, the final result is not completely model-independent. The purity (fraction of well reconstructed events among all selected events) in each \(\mathrm{Z^{\prime}}\) sample is of the order of 80-85%.

The black area represents the combinatorial background where at least one of the selected jets or leptons does not match the corresponding parton.

### Discovery potential

#### 6.3.1 Method and results

The method used to extract the 5\(\sigma\) discovery sensitivity consists of counting the number of Standard Model \(\mathrm{\mathrm{t}\bar{\mathrm{t}}}\) events in a sliding mass window over the invariant mass spectrum. The 5\(\sigma\) sensitivity means that an effect is seen over the expected background with a deviation at least 5 times the background fluctuation in the mass window. The width of the window is twice the detector resolution for a given resonance mass. Then, the lowest cross section times branching ratio \(\sigma\times Br(\mathrm{Z^{\prime}\to t\bar{t}})\) is computed for the discovery of a resonance at a given mass.

The produced resonances are expected to have a width smaller than the resolution, leading to a gaussian shape for the reconstructed invariant mass. The discovery potential is thus estimated here only for narrow \(\mathrm{\mathrm{t}\bar{t}}\) resonances.

This method, explained in detail in [76], requires as input the \(\mathrm{Z^{\prime}}\) mass resolution (Figure 16), the reconstruction efficiency of both Standard Model \(\mathrm{\mathrm{t}\bar{t}}\) events and resonance events, and the purity of the final samples.

The resulting sensitivity is shown on Figure 16. For example, a 700 GeV \(\mathrm{Z^{\prime}}\) resonance produced with a \(\sigma\times Br(\mathrm{Z^{\prime}\to t\bar{t}})\) of 11 pb should be discovered with a 5\(\sigma\) significance after 1 fb\({}^{-1}\) of data taking. The \(\mathrm{\mathrm{t}\bar{t}}\) mass spectrum associated with such a case is shown in Figure 17.

#### 6.3.2 Measurement uncertainties

Uncertainties on the sensitivity arise from:

* the reconstruction efficiency for the \(\mathrm{Z^{\prime}}\) signal and \(\mathrm{\mathrm{t}\bar{t}}\) background. The main contribution arises from the expected error on the b-tag efficiency, which is set to \(\pm\)5%.
* the background contribution (Standard Model \(\mathrm{\mathrm{t}\bar{t}}\)). The main contribution comes from the \(\mathrm{\mathrm{t}\bar{t}}\) cross section uncertainty \({}^{+6.2}_{-4.7}\) %.
* the \(\mathrm{\mathrm{t}\bar{t}}\) mass resolution (Figure 16). The effect on the discovery potential increases with the resonance mass.
* the uncertainty on the integrated luminosity.

The \(5\sigma\) discovery potential is given as a function of the \(\rm t\bar{t}\) resonance mass. The position of the resonance mass peak depends on the accuracy of the jet energy scale. This will be constrained by the W-boson and top quark events themselves.

All these quantities have been varied within expected errors. The impact on the sensitivity is reported in Table 22.

## 7 Summary and conclusions

The ATLAS sensitivity to the measurement of several top quark properties was reviewed in this paper for an expected luminosity of 1 \(\rm fb^{-1}\) at the LHC. The precision of several measurements was estimated, using the full simulation of the ATLAS detector. For the tests of physics beyond the Standard Model associated with the production of top quarks, the 95% CL limit (in the absence of a signal) was presented. In Table 23 a summary of the expected sensitivity on these observables is shown, for a luminosity of 1 \(\rm fb^{-1}\). Several sources of systematic errors were considered using an approach common to all studies appearing in this note.

The sensitivity of the ATLAS experiment to the top quark charge measurement was evaluated. The analysis shows that using the weighting technique, already with 0.1 \(\rm fb^{-1}\) it is possible to distinguish with a \(5\sigma\) significance, between the b-jet charges associated with leptons of opposite charges, which allows to distinguish the Standard Model from an exotic scenario. For the semileptonic b-decay method the required luminosity is \(\simeq 1\)\(\rm fb^{-1}\). The top quark charge itself was reconstructed relying on a Monte

\begin{tabular}{l c c} Source of uncertainty & Error (\%) & Effect on the discovery potential (\%) \\ \hline Reconstruction efficiency & 16.6 & 8.3 \\ Background contribution & \({+6.2\over-4.7}\) & 3.1 \\ \(\rm t\bar{t}\) mass resolution & \(\pm 1\sigma_{\rm resolution}\) & 2 to 11 \\ Luminosity & 5 & 2.5 \\ Jet energy scale & 5 & - \\ \hline \end{tabular}

Carlo calibration of the b-jet charge. Although the reconstruction of the numeric value of the top quark charge using the weighting technique seems possible with \(\simeq 1\) fb\({}^{-1}\), it will be necessary to check the performance of the method with real data e.g. di-jet \(\mathrm{b\bar{b}}\) events, once available. A more realistic treatment of the background processes will be required for a full understanding of the top quark charge issues.

A study of the W-boson polarisation fractions (\(F_{0}\), \(F_{\mathrm{L}}\) and \(F_{\mathrm{R}}\)) and \(\mathrm{t\bar{t}}\) spin correlation parameters (\(A\) and \(A_{\mathrm{D}}\)) has been performed in the semileptonic \(\mathrm{t\bar{t}}\) channel. Reconstructed angular distributions were used to set the ATLAS sensitivity to the measurement of the W-boson polarisations and top quark spin correlation parameters.

The W-boson polarisation ratios (\(\rho_{\mathrm{R}}\) and \(\rho_{\mathrm{L}}\)) and the angular asymmetries (\(A_{+}\) and \(A_{-}\)) dependence on the anomalous couplings (\(V_{\mathrm{R}}\), \(g_{\mathrm{L}}\) and \(g_{\mathrm{R}}\)) was used to find the sensitivity to the Wtb anomalous couplings (for the analyses with and without b-tag).

Top quark rare decays through FCNC processes (\(\mathrm{t\to qZ,q\gamma,qg}\)) were studied in this note using \(\mathrm{t\bar{t}}\) events produced at the LHC. Expected limits on the branching ratios were set at 95% CL in the absence of signal.

The discovery potential of the ATLAS experiment for narrow \(\mathrm{t\bar{t}}\) resonances decaying in the semileptonic channel, was studied as a function of the resonance mass.
