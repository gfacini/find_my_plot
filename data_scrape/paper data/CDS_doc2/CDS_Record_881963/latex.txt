**Abstract**

Results on the photon identification and QCD-jet rejection capabilities of the Atlas detector are presented. The simulation, reconstruction and analysis are done in the framework of Data Challenge 1. This study is based on fully simulated events at the initial low (\(2\times 10^{33}\)cm\({}^{-2}\) s\({}^{-1}\)) and design high (\(10^{34}\)cm\({}^{-2}\) s\({}^{-1}\)) luminosity, on which pile-up is superimposed. A jet rejection factor of about 5000-6000 for \(p_{T}>25\) GeV can be obtained for a photon identification efficiency \(\sim 80\%\). The application of this rejection to the fake background in the \(H\to\gamma\gamma\) analysis is discussed.

Introduction

The identification of isolated high transverse momentum photons (\(p_{T}>25\) GeV/\(c\)) is essential for physics studies at the LHC, especially in the search for the Higgs on the \(H\to\gamma\gamma\) channel. The QCD di-jet cross section being of the order of 1 mb, a rejection factor of about 5000 is required against QCD jets in order to obtain an inclusive photon signal [1].

Since the Physics TDR analyses were published [2][3], the Inner Detector (ID) geometry has been significantly modified with the introduction of a more realistic material description, leading to important changes in performance. During the same time period, the reconstruction software has moved to the object oriented framework Athena[4]. This note describes the inclusive photon selection and the rejection capability against QCD-jets using information from the electromagnetic and hadronic calorimeters as well as the ID, using data produced for Data Challenge 1 (DC1) [5]. For the separation of photons from jets, discriminating variables are defined, based on both of the calorimeters and the inner tracking system. Cuts on these variables are developed to maintain high photon efficiency even in the presence of pile-up. The photon identification efficiency is studied for photons from a 120 GeV Higgs boson at low and high luminosities, close to the nominal trigger thresholds. The jet rejection is normalised to the total number of QCD jets smeared and reconstructed at the particle level using Atlfast[6], (cone size \(\Delta R=0.4\)). However, different normalisations exist [7] and a parton level normalisation is also given.

The note is organised as follows. A description of the data samples and the geometric layout of the simulation used is given in section 2. The trigger selection applied at Lv1 is presented in section 3.1. The offline selection procedure is described in 3.2. Results are presented and discussed in section 4.

## 2 Detector layout and data samples

### Detector layout

In this note the DC1 layout is used. Details of the changes since TDR are summarised in [5]. The material budget of the ID is higher in the DC1 layout than in the TDR. Conversion is even more pronounced (Fig. 1), especially in the end-cap, because photons have to pass more material before reaching the calorimeters. In the past, the magnetic field in the ID volume has been simulated to be 2 T. In DC1, the detailed field map is used. The end-caps of the calorimeter have been shifted by 4 cm to leave more space to bring out cables in the crack between the barrel and end-cap cryostats. A summary of some design parameters of the electromagnetic calorimeter, which will be used later in the note, is given in Tab. 1.

### Reconstruction and analysis

The Monte Carlo events were generated and filtered [8] for DC1 with Pythia 6.203 [9] under the Athena framework and stored in Root format [10]. Monte Carlo events were simulated in the Atlas detector with Geant 3 [11], based on the Atlsim/Dice program [12], version 3.2.1. The inputs were the event kinematics from Root-format files and the output was the detector hits and digits in Zebra-format files. The DC1 data were reconstructed using Athena release 6.0.4. Electronic noise in the electromagnetic calorimeter and pile-up are included.

### Data sets

In order to evaluate the performance of the photon identification algorithm, photon events from Higgs decay with pseudo-rapidity \(|\eta|<2.5\) at low (high) luminosity are used. In order to evaluate the rejection factors QCD dijet events, including initial and final state radiation, are used. The cut on the transverse momentum of the hard scattering process is \(p_{T}\geq 17\) (25) GeV/c with a pseudo rapidity within \(\pm 2.7\). Detailed information about the samples is given in Table 2. The analysis is performed on the combined ntuples.

In addition to QCD di-jet events, other physics processes such as prompt photon events, intermediate \(W/Z\) boson production and quark bremsstrahlung were included in the "jet" samples (cf. Tab. 3).

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|} \hline Data & luminosity & \(E_{T}\) [GeV] & dataset \\ \hline

\end{table}
Table 3: _Cross sections of physics events simulated in di-jet sample 002000._Dijet events which would not pass the particle level filter mimic of the \(E_{T}\) cut are rejected before the detector simulation: There must be at least one region of size \(\Delta\eta\times\Delta\phi=0.12\times 0.12\) in which the summed transverse energy of all stable particles except muons and neutrinos is at least 17 GeV (22 GeV for sample 002001). Only 8.39% (10.20%) of all generated events in sample 002000 (002001) are accepted and then fully simulated. Pile-up is added to study these datasets for low luminosity (\(2\times 10^{33}\) cm\({}^{-2}\) s\({}^{-1}\)) and high luminosity (\(10^{34}\) cm\({}^{-2}\) s\({}^{-1}\)). The number of pile-up events per bunch crossing follows a Poisson distribution with an average of 4.6 (23.0) at low (high) luminosity.

## 3 Selection criteria

### Level 1 trigger

At Level 1 (Lvl1), photons are selected using calorimeter information with a reduced granularity compared with that of the calorimeter. The \(H\rightarrow\gamma\gamma\) analysis will be mostly based on the HLT diphoton trigger, which has as input the Lvl1 trigger on a pair of electromagnetic objects. Two trigger thresholds are used : _2em15i_ at low luminosity and _2em20i_ at high luminosity [13]. The first pair of letters stands for the physics object, in this case an electromagnetic one. The second pair of letters is the \(E_{T}\) for which the trigger is applied and the last letter \(i\) indicates an isolation requirement. The thresholds applied are summarised here for _2em15i_ (_2em20i_) :

* the transverse energy in the electromagnetic calorimeter in \(1\times 2\) or \(2\times 1\) trigger towers (\(\Delta\eta\times\Delta\phi=0.1\times 0.1\)) is greater than 11 (16) GeV;
* the electromagnetic isolation, summed over 12 towers around the \(2\times 2\) trigger tower cluster core is less than or equal to 4 GeV;
* the hadronic isolation, summed over 12 towers around the \(2\times 2\) trigger tower cluster core is less than or equal to 2 GeV;
* the core of the hadronic leakage into \(2\times 2\) trigger towers behind the electromagnetic cluster is less than or equal to 2 GeV.

Note that all these cuts, except the first one, are already applied in the L1EM block in the combined ntuple, so it is not possible to study in detail the origin of event loss at Lvl1

As we are estimating the rejection for a single jet, when applying the Lvl1 cut, we apply it only to the corresponding photon candidate. The results shown later will be presented first using only the full offline selection, and the effect of Lvl1 will be shown as an additional step: The offline cuts are expected to be tighter that the Lvl1 selection, which should thus be very efficient for offline selected events. We will see, however, that the Lvl1 isolation cut plays a non-negligible role when no explicit isolation cut is applied offline to the photon candidate.

### Offline analysis

In order to separate photons from jets, discriminating variables are defined based on both of the calorimeters and the inner tracking system. Cuts on these variables are developed to maintain high photon efficiency even in the presence of pile-up. The discriminating variables used in this study are the same as in previous studies [1][2][3]. The offline photon/jet separation procedure consists principally of the following steps :* calorimeter information is used to select events containing a high-\(E_{T}\) electromagnetic shower. The fine grained first compartment allows to reject \(\pi^{0}\) induced showers.
* inner detector information is used to improve the results, using a track isolation algorithm.

The inclusive dijet sample includes prompt photon events (cf. Tab 3). These events are vetoed in this study of the rejection. A part of the dijet sample contains photons originating from quark bremsstrahlung, which are also vetoed in this study. The remaining events are referred to as the QCD dijet sample (so in all the following a cluster originating from \(\pi^{0}\to\gamma\gamma\) will be considered as a fake photon candidate).

#### 3.2.1 Use of calorimeter information

EgammaRec is an algorithm designed to calculate quantities that can be used to separate electrons and photons from jets. In the electromagnetic calorimeter photons are narrow objects, while jets tend to have a broader profile. Hence, shower shapes can be used to reject jets. This is handled by the EMBowerBuilder which calls a number of algorithms that calculate diverse quantities using information from the first and second samplings of the electromagnetic calorimeter, as well as the first sampling of the hadronic calorimeter.

Only electromagnetic clusters with \(E_{T}>20\) GeV are considered in this study. In the Higgs sample, which is used for the efficiency estimate, the clusters are required to be matched to true photons from Higgs decays (\(\Delta R\) photon-cluster less than 0.2). Fig. 2 shows the \(E_{T}\) distributions, after the Lvl1 trigger for all clusters found in the electromagnetic calorimeter. In the Higgs sample, the low \(E_{T}\) clusters which are low energy particles from pile-up events have already been rejected by requiring that the cluster is matched to a true photon. In the jet samples, the first peak arises from threshold cuts at 5 GeV on the reconstruction of clusters. The second peak arises from the hard scaterring cut applied on the Pythia sample, as well as from the particle level filter and to a smaller extend from the Lvl1 \(E_{T}\) threshold.

**Hadronic leakage :**

Electromagnetic showers deposit only a small amount of energy in the hadronic calorimeter, typically less than 2% in the case of photons. The hadronic leakage is defined as the ratio of the transverse energy reconstructed in a window \(\Delta\eta\times\Delta\phi=0.2\times 0.2\) in the first compartment of the hadronic calorimeter to the transverse energy of the cluster reconstructed in the electromagnetic calorimeter. This ratio is shown in Fig. 3 for photons and jets at low luminosity.

**Use of the second compartment of the ECAL :**

Electromagnetic showers deposit most of their energy in the second sampling of the electromagnetic calorimeter. The following variables are used in this region :

* Photons deposit most of their energy in a \(\Delta\eta\times\Delta\phi=3\times 7\) window (in units of middle cells). The lateral shower shape variables, \(R_{\eta}(37)\) and \(R_{\phi}(33)\), are given by the ratio of the energy reconstructed in a \(3\times 7\) cluster to the energy in a \(7\times 7\) cluster and the ratio of the energy reconstructed in a \(3\times 3\) cluster to the energy in a \(3\times 7\) cluster respectively. These variables (see Fig. 4, top) show a peak near one for photons due to their very small lateral leakage, with large tails in the jet distributions at lower values of \(R_{\eta}(37)\) and \(R_{\phi}(33)\) as expected. As a result of the magnetic field increasing the width of the converted photon contribution in the \(\phi\) direction, \(R_{\phi}(33)\) is less discriminating than \(R_{\eta}(37)\).
* The lateral width in eta is calculated in a window of \(3\times 5\) cells using the energy

The distributions are shown for jets (unshaded histogram) and photons (shaded histogram) at low luminosity, with \(20<E_{T}<30~{}GeV\). Only the simulated Lvl1 trigger is applied beforehand. The distributions are normalised to unit area.

The left plot shows events with \(120~{}GeV\) Higgs photons at low luminosity (solid line) and high luminosity (dashed line). The right plot shows jets at low (solid line) and high (dashed line) luminosity. The peak around 20 GeV is coming mostly from the hard scattering cut and the particle level filter applied on the Pythia jet samples.

weighted sum over all cells, which depends on the particle impact point inside the cell : \(\omega_{\eta 2}=\sqrt{\frac{\sum E_{c}\times\eta^{2}}{\sum E_{c}}-\left(\frac{ \sum E_{c}\times\eta}{\sum E_{c}}\right)^{2}}\). This width is shown for photons and jets in Fig. 4 (bottom).

**Use of the first compartment of the ECAL :**

Cuts applied on the variables in the hadronic calorimeter and the second sampling of the electromagnetic calorimeter reject jets with high energy pions and wide showers. Jets containing single or multiple \(\eta\), \(\pi^{0}\) etc., are now the main contribution which can fake photons. The first compartment with its very fine granularity in rapidity can be used to look for substructures in the showers and thus isolated \(\pi^{0}\) and \(\gamma\) can be distinguished efficiently. The lateral shower shape in the strips is exploited for \(|\eta|<2.35\) where the strip granularity is good enough and provided that at least a small fraction of the total energy (0.5% or greater) is reconstructed in the first sampling. For all first compartment criteria, two cells in \(\phi\) are summed.

Figure 4: Lateral shower shape \(R_{\eta}(37)\) (top left) and \(R_{\phi}(33)\) (top right) and lateral width \(\omega_{\eta 2}\) (bottom). The distributions are shown for jets (unshaded histograms) and photons (shaded histograms) at low. Only the simulated Lvl1 trigger is applied beforehand. The distributions are normalised to unit area.

* Jets with \(\pi^{0}\) decays are often found to have two maxima. Taking advantage of the fine granularity the shower is studied in a window \(\Delta\eta\times\Delta\phi=0.125\times 0.2\) (cf. Fig. 5) around the hottest cell to look for a second maximum. If more than two maxima are found the second highest maximum is considered. Two variables are used :
* the difference \(\Delta E=E_{\rm max2}-E_{\rm min}\) between the energy associated with the second maximum \(E_{\rm max2}\) and the energy reconstructed in the strip with the minimal value between the first and second maxima \(E_{\rm min}\) (see Fig. 5, left).
* \(\tilde{E}_{\rm max2}=E_{\rm max2}/(1+9\times 10^{-3}E_{T})[GeV]\), where \(E_{T}\) is the transverse energy of the cluster in the electromagnetic calorimeter and the constant value 9 has units \(GeV^{-1}\) (see Fig. 5, right). The value of the second maximal energy deposit is corrected as a function of the transverse energy to avoid sensitivity to fluctuations[1]1. Footnote 1: The scaling with \(E_{T}\) used is the same as in the previous study, and we have not tried to re-optimise it.
* \(F_{\rm side}\), the fraction of energy deposited outside the shower core of three central strips, is shown in Fig. 6 (left). It is calculated from the following formula : \(F_{\rm side}=\left[E(\pm 3)-E(\pm 1)\right]/E(\pm 1)\), where \(E(\pm n)\) is the energy deposited in \(\pm\)\(n\) strips around the strip with the highest energy.
* \(\omega_{\rm 3st\,fips}\), the shower width over three strips around the one with the maximal energy deposit is shown in Fig. 6 (right). It is given by the following formula : \(\omega_{\rm 3st\,fips}=\sqrt{\sum E_{i}\times\left(i-i_{max}\right)^{2}/\sum E_{i}}\), where \(i\) is the number of the strip and \(i_{max}\) the number of the most energetic strip.

Figure 5: _Left : Difference, \(\Delta E\), between the energy of the second maxima \(E_{\rm max2}\) and the energy reconstructed in the strip with the minimal value between the first and second maxima (\(E_{\rm min}\)). Right : \(\tilde{E}_{\rm max2}\). The distributions are shown for jets (unshaded histograms) and photons (shaded histograms) at low luminosity. Only the simulated Lvl1 trigger is applied beforehand. The distributions are normalised to unit area._

Fig. 7 shows the average values of the calorimeter-based discriminating variables used for photon/jet separation as a function of the pseudo-rapidity. Since these variables are pseudo-rapidity dependent, the threshold values are tuned separately in several intervals :

* \(|\eta|\leq 0.75\);
* \(0.75<|\eta|\leq 1.37\);
* \(1.52<|\eta|\leq 1.8\);
* \(1.8<|\eta|\leq 2.0\);
* \(2.0<|\eta|\leq 2.37\).

The subdivision is motivated by the varying granularities and material in front of the electromagnetic calorimeter. The first two bins cover the barrel electromagnetic calorimeter. The crack in the calorimeters between \(1.37<|\eta|<1.52\) is excluded. The quantities calculated using the first compartment can be used only in the regions \(|\eta|<1.37\) and \(1.52<|\eta|<2.37\) since there are no strips in the crack region or beyond \(|\eta|>2.40\)2

Footnote 2: For the Higgs to two photon analysis, we assume that this is the definition of the fiducial region, and we look at the photon/jet separation only in this fiducial region. Note that previous studies have been done up to eta of 2.47, including thus some region without fine strip segmentation.

The cuts on the variables are tuned to obtain an efficiency of approximately 80%, independent of pseudo-rapidity \(\eta\). Cut thresholds are chosen to be as close as possible to the edge of the photon distributions. The details of the cuts applied at the calorimeter level at low and high luminosity are shown in appendix A.

The same cuts are applied for converted and unconverted photons. Studies [14] of the \(\gamma\)-\(\pi^{0}\) separation have shown that if conversions can be identified efficiently, different cuts can be applied for converted and unconverted photons, which would allow an increase by 10-20% the rejection for the same overall efficiency.

The distributions are normalised to unit area._

#### 3.2.2 Use of Inner Detector information

After the calorimeter cuts, the contamination of the inclusive signal from charged hadrons is greatly reduced. The remaining background is dominated by low multiplicity jets containing high-\(p_{T}\)\(\pi^{0}\) mesons.

This is shown in Fig. 8. The plot on the left shows the ratio between the cluster energy and the energy of the leading \(\pi^{0}\) in a cone of 0.2 around the cluster. About 65% of the clusters comes for the main part from a single \(\pi^{0}\) (the ratio between the \(\pi^{0}\) and cluster transverse energies is equal to 1\(\pm\)0.1). After the application of the cuts on the shower shape in the first section of the EM calorimeter, this background cannot be reduced using only the cluster shower shape information. Indeed most of the surviving \(\pi^{0}\) are either very asymmetric decays, or decays with a small opening in \(\eta\) (less than one strip). The other fake photons come mostly from \(\eta\rightarrow\gamma\gamma\), \(\omega\rightarrow\gamma\pi^{0}\), and multi \(\pi^{0}\) events (about 20% of the total). There is a small (about 5-10%) contribution from single electrons and single charged hadrons. On the other hand, plot on the right of this figure shows that the cluster does not take the full energy of the original parton which produced it (defined as the leading quark or gluon in the Pythia event record within \(\Delta\)R of 0.4 around the cluster). Typically, only 70% of the parton energy is found in the cluster energy. There is thus a non negligible amount of hadronic activity around the cluster which can be used to increase the rejection. In the following, we will use a cut on track isolation using the information from the inner detector (ID)3.

Footnote 3: Calorimeter isolation variables are not available in the combined ntuples produced during DC1. However, a first look at events simulated later with Geant4 seems to indicate that an isolation cut using simple cone calorimetric isolation variables is not better than track isolation, although the calorimeter algorithm can probably be refined

The variable defined for the track isolation is the sum of the \(p_{T}\) of all tracks with \(\Delta R<0.3\) (\(\Delta R\) is the \(\eta-\phi\) distance between the track parameters at the vertex and the cluster position). One should keep in mind that in the reconstruction applied to the DC1

Figure 8: _Comparison between the cluster \(p_{T}\) and the leading \(\pi^{0}\) (left) and ratio between the cluster \(p_{T}\) and the parton transverse energy (right) for clusters fulfilling all calorimeter shower shape cuts, in the low luminosity sample._samples, there is an effective cut-off on the track \(p_{T}\) which is close to 2 GeV/\(c\). In order not to include in this variable the tracks coming from photon conversion, some additional selections are applied to tracks with \(\Delta R<0.1\):

* the impact parameter must be less than 0.01 cm.
* the track \(p_{T}\) must not exceed 15 GeV/\(c\) (to remove tracks from very asymmetric conversions).
* the track must not have a partner forming a photon conversion candidate. A partner is the closest track in \(\cot(\theta)\) of opposite sign such that:
* the distance of closest approach between the two circles of the track trajectories in the transverse plane is less than 0.15 cm;
* the radius of the point of closest approach is less than 100 cm.

This is of course a very naive conversion search. Note that in this procedure, the aim is not to identify converted photons, but just to remove conversion tracks from the isolation variable. With this in mind, the fact that the reconstruction applied in DC1 has a tight cut on the number of precision hits is actually a helpful feature in reducing the contamination from conversion tracks. The "isolated" electron contribution to the photon sample is not removed by this cut and could be removed if there is an efficient separation between prompt electrons and conversion electrons. This would reduce the jet background by about 10%.

Fig. 9 shows the distributions of this track isolation variable in the low luminosity samples. The left part compares the distribution of all photons from Higgs with the one for only unconverted photons. The effect of conversions on the efficiency of a cut on this variable is less than 0.2%. The right part compares the distribution of the track isolation variable for photons from Higgs and fake photons in the jet sample, after all calorimeter shower shape cuts have been applied (as well as the Lvl1 simulation). The cut applied on this isolation variable is 2.5 GeV/\(c\) at low luminosity and 4 GeV/\(c\) at high luminosity. The efficiency for a photon from Higgs decay is approximately 96%, the rejection factor against jets fulfilling all previous cuts is around 1.6-1.7.

## 4 Performance of the algorithm

### Photon identification

The identification of a candidate cluster as originating from a signal photon is based on the whole sequence of criteria described above. The identification efficiency \(\varepsilon_{\gamma}\) for photons at low and high luminosity is detailed in Table 4 over the full rapidity range \(|\eta|<2.37\). The inter-cryostat region (crack) of the calorimeters in the range \(1.37<|\eta|<1.52\) is excluded.

The total efficiency \(\varepsilon_{\gamma}\) is \(\sim 80\%\) at low luminosity and \(\sim 78\%\) at high luminosity. Fig. 10 shows the efficiency as a function of pseudo-rapidity (left) and transverse momentum (right). The efficiency is lower for converted photons because their showers start earlier and are thus broader in the calorimeter (this effect is also increased in the \(\phi\) direction by the magnetic field). However, these photons are also the ones for which the energy is less well measured, so this is not necessarily a bad feature. The efficiency also increasesslightly with \(p_{T}\). This dependence can be reduced by finer tuning of the cuts, but on the other hand, as the fake background is mostly at low \(p_{T}\), a small increase in the efficiency with \(p_{T}\) may be better for the significance of a Higgs signal [15], although given the uncertainties in the fake background this is very difficult to quantify.

### Jet rejection

The rejection is normalised with respect to the number of jets: \(R=\frac{N[jets]}{N[fake~{}\gamma]}\). The jets are reconstructed with the fast simulation program Atlfast starting with the unfiltered generated sample4. Uncorrected Atlfast jets have been used. The number of jets above 20 (25) GeV in the \(\eta\) fiducial range is 0.335 (0.167) per generated event in the low luminosity (17 GeV parton level cut) sample. In the high luminosity sample (25 GeV parton level cut) there are 0.539 jets above 25 GeV per gener

Footnote 5: A few pathological ntuples were removed.

Tab. 5 details the rejection factors against QCD jets obtained after each step of the analysis at low and high luminosity, with the number of \(\pi^{0}\) remaining after each cut. The first layer of the electromagnetic calorimeter enables a reduction in this number by a factor of about 2-3. The rejections are given before and after the Lv1 cuts are applied. Before an explicit isolation cut is applied offline, the isolation cut applied at Lv1 increases the rejection by 15-40% depending on the sample. The effect of the Lv1 cuts is significantly smaller when track isolation cuts are applied: It is about 5% in the low luminosity sample and around 15% in the high luminosity sample. Unfortunately, it is not possible to study in detail the origin of this small effect at the ntuple output level.

After all cuts, the rejection is 4760 (6680) for \(p_{T}>20\) (\(>25\)) GeV at low luminosity and 4930 for \(p_{T}>25\) GeV at high luminosity 6.

Footnote 6: The same \(p_{T}\) cut being applied to the Atlfast jets and the reconstructed photons. If a cut a 17 GeV is applied to the jets while the photon candidates are cut at 20 GeV, the rejection value for the low luminosity sample increases by \(\approx\,50\%\).

The rejection can be evaluated as a function of \(p_{T}\) by taking the ratio of the \(p_{T}\)(jet) and the \(p_{T}\)(photon candidate) spectra (see Fig. 11). In principle, since a given \(p_{T}\)(photon) can come from a full spectrum of jet \(p_{T}\) this curve cannot be directly applied to any sample having a jet spectrum different from the one of the inclusive jets. A more detailed procedure to deconvolute the jet spectrum will be discussed in the next section. The rejection curve as a function of the transverse momentum is shown in Fig. 12. The rejection is shown for all jets at both luminosities (left) as well as for gluon- and quark-initiated jets separately at low luminosity (right). Cluster and jets are defined as coming from a quark or a gluon using the type of the highest energy parton in a cone of 0.4. The gluon jet rejection is higher than the quark jet rejection by a factor of about 5-7 due to the lower probability of fragmentation of gluons to \(\pi^{0}\) carrying a large fraction of

the original parton momentum: For \(p_{T}>25\) GeV/\(c\) in the low luminosity sample, the rejection after the isolation cut is \(2880\pm 190\) for quark jets and \(20650\pm 2370\) for gluon jets. The difference in fragmentation is illustrated in Fig. 13 which shows the \(\pi^{0}\) fragmentation functions for quarks and gluons[16]. At a momentum fraction \(x\) of 0.7, there is a factor of about 5 difference between the fragmentation functions. Pythia displays the same trend in the high \(x\) region. The fragmentation functions from[16] have been fitted from \(e^{+}e^{-}\) data (mostly LEP). The quark fragmentation function to \(\pi^{\pm}\) (\(\pi^{0}\) are half the sum of \(\pi^{+}\) and \(\pi^{-}\)) is measured with reasonable accuracy up to an \(x\) of 0.7. At 0.9, there are still data with \(\approx 50\%\) accuracy. The gluon fragmentation function has been studied with 3-jet events. There are a couple of data points at \(x\)=0.7 with a \(\approx 50\%\) accuracy and essentially no data above. Before the isolation cut, the typical momentum fraction of the remaining \(\pi^{0}\) is typically 0.7, so the uncertainty on the quark jet rejection from the uncertainty on the fragmentation is probably under control. The uncertainty on the gluon jet rejection is likely to be significantly higher, probably close to a factor of 2, but still smaller than the difference between the quark jet and gluon jet rejections. After the isolation cut, the \(x\) of the remaining events is higher, thus the relative uncertainty on the rejection increases, but one expects the quark-gluon difference to be higher. The difference between quark and gluon jets with fully simulated Atlas events has been confirmed in reference [17].

The effect of the track isolation cut on the jet rejection at low luminosity can be seen in Fig. 14 (the Lv1l cut being already applied). This criterion increases the rejection globally by a factor of about 1.7, while having a slightly greater effect at higher energies.

The difference between the two samples (hard parton scattering cut at 17 GeV for the low luminosity sample and at 25 GeV for the high luminosity sample) comes mostly from the differences in the cuts applied at low luminosity and high luminosity to preserve the same efficiency, and to a smaller extent from statistical differences between the underlying samples. This is illustrated in more detail in Fig. 15 which compares the results obtained above with those derived from the 25 GeV sample digitised and reconstructed in low luminosity conditions[18].

Differences with [1] are explained primarily by the exclusion of bremsstrahlung from the fake background in this note, whereas [1] includes it. Including the bremsstrahlung photons in the fake background would typically reduce the rejection by a factor 1.5 (for a \(p_{T}\) cut at 20-25 GeV). Exclusion of bremsstrahlung is motivated by the fact that in the \(H\to\gamma\gamma\) analysis, the bremsstrahlung is a higher order of the irreducible background. Retaining this contribution in the reducible background and rejection computation would give rise to a problem of double counting. It is also worth pointing out that if true photons are not vetoed in the jet

sample, the number of photon candidates consists of a similar number of true photons and fake photons for \(p_{T}>25\) GeV/\(c\). For higher \(p_{T}\) the rate of true photons becomes higher than the rate of fakes (see Fig.16).

As mentioned in the introductory remarks, there are alternative normalisation techniques to the Atlfast 'uncorrected' jets method used to compute the rejections quoted above. One such alternative is to normalise the rejection with respect to the initial parton distribution. After all cuts (including the simulated Lvl1 trigger) and using the same energy thresholds as above, this normalisation returns a rejection of \(10520\pm 350\) (\(14890\pm 820\)) for \(p_{T}>20\) (25) GeV at low luminosity and \(10310\pm 320\) for \(p_{T}>25\) GeV at high luminosity. The rejection against partons is therefore higher than that against Atlfast 'uncorrected' jets by a factor of \(2-3\), as expected

lies above the Atlfast'uncorrected' jet spectrum by the same factor. This difference is due to the fact that the fixed-radius cone algorithm employed by the 'uncorrected' version of Atlfast omits from the jet distribution any particles lying outside the cone, hence underestimating the number of initial jets.

### Parameterisation of the rejection and deconvolution of the \(p_{T}\) spectrum

To take into account the fact that a fake photon with a given \(p_{T}\) can come from any jet with a higher \(p_{T}\) and to obtain a parameterisation which can be applied to samples which have a different \(p_{T}\) spectrum than the inclusive jets the following procedure is used: Fake photons (and jets) are associated with a parton (as before, the highest energy parton in a cone of 0.4 is used). The events are binned in \(p_{T}\)(parton) (5 GeV wide bins between 0 and 100 GeV). In each \(p_{T}\)(parton) bin, the normalised fake spectrum \(p_{T}\)(cluster) is computed (again with 5 GeV wide bins between 0 and 100 GeV). This is done separately for quark- and gluon-initiated clusters. Again, the normalisation of the fake spectrum is obtained using the unfiltered jet sample. This is illustrated in Fig. 17 and Fig. 18, for the low luminosity sample. Again, it can be seen the rejection is higher for gluon jets than for quark jets. One can also see that before the isolation cut there is a large probability that a high \(p_{T}\) parton gives a much lower \(p_{T}\) fake cluster. These events are strongly reduced by the isolation cut, while events where the fake cluster has the same \(p_{T}\) as the original parton are much less rejected by the isolation cut, as was naively expected. To compute the fake background in any sample, for each jet, the fake cluster probability corresponding to the associated parton is used. This gives for one jet a full normalised spectrum of fake cluster \(p_{T}\). This can be done on pair of jets to get the contribution from two fake photons in the same event. To check this procedure, it has been applied to the inclusive jet sample to predict the inclusive spectrum of fake photons. This prediction can then be directly compared to the observed spectrum in this sample. This comparison is shown in Fig. 19. The agreement is good, although the parameterisation starts to run out of statistics in the high \(p_{T}\) bins. This method is then used to compute the fake background to the \(H\to\gamma\gamma\) channel. The low luminosity rejections are used. The effect of the Lvl1 cuts is ignored. Two contributions have to be computed:

* Two fake photons from dijet events.
* One fake photon and one true photon, from gamma+jet events.

Each contribution is estimated by generating the corresponding Pythia events and applying the fake parameterisation. The standard kinematical cuts for this analysis are applied (highest \(p_{T}\) above 40 GeV/\(c\) and lowest \(p_{T}\) above 25 GeV/\(c\) with the fiducial cuts on the pseudorapidity). The invariant mass distribution is computed using the predicted energy spectra for the fake clusters. This is illustrated in Fig. 20 which shows separately for each background source the invariant mass at the parton level, at the jet level and at the fake cluster level. Dijet events are strongly suppressed by the square of the rejection factor. The suppression of gamma+jet events is smaller than the average rejection of inclusive jets mostly because these events are dominated by gamma+quark events (accounting for about 90% of the gamma+jet events) and also to a smaller extent due to the different \(p_{T}\) spectra once the cut at 40 GeV is applied to one of the photon candidates. The overall background level before and after applying the track isolation cut is summarised in Fig 21. Using the leading order Pythia cross-sections for the normalisation, the fake background rate is 20 fb/GeV (65 fb/GeV) after (before) the track isolation cut at a mass of 120 GeV. It is dominated by gamma+jet events7. This can be compared with the irreducible background (after all cuts and photon efficiency) which can be estimated using NLO computations[19] to be 125 fb/GeV. If a typical \(K\) factor of 1.5 to 2 is applied to the LO Pythia cross-sections, the fake background is 25-30% (80-100%) of theirreducible one after (before) the track isolation cut. One has to keep in mind that the uncertainty on the fake background is probably at least a factor 2 (the uncertainty on the jet-jet background being higher because it scales with the square of the rejection, and it involves more gluon fragmentation which is more uncertain). This estimate of the gamma-jet fake background is significantly higher than the one performed in the TDR because the quark-gluon difference was ignored. An Isolation cut is thus very likely to be required in order to keep this background significantly below the irreducible one.

Conclusion

In this note the photon/jet separation power of the Atlas detector has been presented, estimated on fully simulated data with DC1 layout. This study shows that it is possible to achieve a rejection on QCD jets of the order of 5000 while maintaining an overall efficiency of about 80%, including track isolation cuts. The remaining background is made up mainly of photons from \(\pi^{0}\) decays, so there is probably not much to be gained from a better tuning of the separation cuts, although an efficient conversion identification algorithm would allow an improvement of the order of 20% in the rejection for the same efficiency. Based on these studies, it was been demonstrated that the reducible background can probably be kept below the irreducible one in the \(H\to\gamma\gamma\) analysis. This may not be the case if no isolation cut is applied.
