###### Abstract

The dependence of the background rates in the ATLAS muon system on the material of the shielding plug sitting in between the calorimeter end-cap cryostat and the end-cap toroid is investigated in view of the high cost of the originally proposed heavy metal solution [1].

It is shown how the effect of using a copper plug instead of a tungsten one is producing a detectable but still acceptable increase in the overall hall background, consistent with naive expectations based on density, nuclear interaction lengths and neutron production multiplicities of the two considered materials.

At the same time the rates presented at the april ATLAS week which showed a significant increase when compared with TP figures are reported and compared with calculations where the effect on the background rates of introducing a tile plug into the crack was investigated.

## 1 Introduction and description of the setup

In the ATLAS Technical Proposal [1] a shielding configuration was proposed to keep charged and neutral particle rates in the muon system within acceptable rates. Among the many measures adopted to shield the muon system, a heavy metal plug (\(\rho=18.2\ g\ cm^{-3}\), out of which \(\rho_{W}=17.3\ g\ cm^{-3}\), \(\rho_{Cu}=0.274\ g\ cm^{-3}\), \(\rho_{Ni}=0.638\ g\ cm^{-3}\)) was foreseen to sit in between the end-cap calorimeter cryostat and the Forward Toroid, below the first forward muon station, in a region where space is at premium and particle fluences are large. In the last simulation setups, such a plug is covering the range Z=666.5-740 cm and \(\eta\)=4.8-3.0, corresponding to a total volume of \(2.2\cdot 10^{6}\) cm\({}^{3}\) and to a mass of 40.6 tons of heavy metal. The total radial thickness of the plug at Z=700 cm is of about 58 cm, corresponding to about 5.2 and 3.5 \(\lambda_{in}\) for heavy metal and copper respectively. However, the average neutron multiplicity of hadron interactions on tungsten is larger than for copper due to the larger evaporation contribution typical of heavynuclei (for example a 30(100) MeV neutron produces on average 1.9(2.8) neutrons on Cu and 3.2(5.3) on W), resulting in a larger build up factor. Taking into account the different build-up factors, the expected extra attenuation due to heavy metal for particles streaming through the plug is of the order of 60 %. Furthermore taking also into account that tungsten is much less effective in moderating low energy neutrons (\(\rightarrow\) the neutron equilibrium spectrum in the plug exhibits a larger bump at energies in the \(\leq\) MeV range) and that a comparable fraction of background is coming from punchthrough from the EC calorimeters and streaming among the cryostat walls, the overall reduction factor expected in the first forward station at the largest rapidities is of the order of 30 %. Such a small factor should not be surprising, the effectiveness of heavy metal would increase exponentially with the shield thickness and it would eventually reduce by large factors particle streaming for enough thickness. Unfortunately the available space is such that both a copper and a heavy metal plug are not too much effective.

The comparison has been carried out on the most recent setup, which will be indicated as **TP17** (with the heavy metal plug) and **TP19** (with the copper one). The "cold" heavy metal block backing at large rapidities the integrated Forward Calorimeter was not touched. Therefore it was made out of heavy metal in all presented configurations.

The configuration whose design and rates have been extensively described in the Technical Proposal will be indicated as **TP13** in all tables and figures and the resulting background rates are reported here for comparison. Before describing the calculations and commenting the results, it is worthwhile to introduce another setup.

After the TP completion, a few dimensions and thicknesses were revised, leading to the configuration which will be indicated as **TP14** and which led to the so called "crack crisis". The main differences with respect to TP13 were in the Barrel-Extended Barrel crack geometry, in an increase of the (horizontal) gap in between the end-cap cryostat and the Extended Barrel tile Calorimeter, in a reduction of the shielding copper plate backing the end-cap hadron calorimeter (from 20 to 14 cm) and in the assumptions about the shielding iron used in the shielding cone extending from the end of the end-cap toroid to the end of the hall. In particular the somewhat optimistic assumption used for the TP of an shield made up of iron of high density (\(\rho\approx 7.8\) g cm\(-3\)) _and_ with a large carbon content was no longer adopted, since the two requirements are somewhat conflicting. A high carbon content is very helpful in providing some neutron moderation and therefore in preventing neutrons in the iron resonance region (below \(\approx 700\) keV) to escape freely when their energy lies in the resonance windows. A high density is of obvious help in getting the maximum of attenuation. Realistic targets are probably densities in the 7.8 g cm\({}^{-3}\) range with little carbon content, or large carbon contents with densities as low as 7.1-7.2 g cm\({}^{-3}\) ("cast iron"). Such a density reduction corresponds to about one \(\lambda\) for the ATLAS shielding thickness and was felt more dangerous than the removal of carbon. A posteriori the effect is probably very similar, however the assumption of high density and almost carbon free iron can be surely met, while for cast iron the control on the carbon content is difficult and strongly dependent on the manufacturer etc. The changes occurred in the simulated crack setup were several, and mainly connected to an increased width and to a reduction of the iron which partially closes the crack themselves. In particular the girder structure of the tile calorimeters was assumed to continue across the crack, and 1 out of 3 of the resulting 64 modules was removed to account for cables and pipes coming from the calorimeters and the inner detector. The opening fraction (1/3) was the same one used for the TP, but the geometry was significantly more realistic since slots were no longer in the longitudinal direction, but rather in the azimuthal one. However the resulting total iron thickness was much less than those of TP13 because the girders were supposed partially empty as they are along the calorimeters. Both assumptions have been reviewed and discussed in the "crack committee", and it is now clear that the girders in the crack region will be filled with iron anyway (\(\rightarrow\) right direction) and the total slot area required for pipes and cables is possibly much less than 1/3 of the full crack surface (\(\rightarrow\) right direction).

An attempt was also made to investigate the effect on the background rates of introducing a tile "plug" into the crack, which should help in partially recovering the performance degradation of the calorimeters in this region. A 20 cm thick tile plug has been introduced and the resulting configuration is referred to as **TP17**. It is the configuration which has been used to carry out the comparison between the heavy metal and copper plugs.

An updated setup increased iron and smaller slots will be implemented and investigated for the next (september) ATLAS week.

## 2 Simulation methods

All the calculations have been performed with the code FLUKA. Details about the code and its physical models, as well as benchmarks for both electromagnetic and hadronic applications can be found in [2, 3, 5, 4, 6, 8, 7, 9, 11, 10].

The minimum bias events to be used as a source in FLUKA have been generated using the code DTUJET93 [12].

For each setup separate runs have been performed to determine background levels and their statistical errors.

Care has been taken when running configurations TP17 and TP19 to use exactly the same code version (the physical models embedded in FLUKA are continuously improved, and therefore from time to time slight variations of the order of 5-10 % can appear for the same configuration), to allow a safe comparison between the heavy metal and the copper plug configurations.

## 3 Results

The background fluences (neutral particles) and rates (charged particles), are reported in tables 1-15 for the four considered configurations which are summarized for the sake of clarity below:

* TP13: TP one * TP14: revised TP one ("crack crisis")
* TP17: TP14 with the 20 cm thick tile plug
* TP19: TP17 with a copper plug instead of a heavy metal one

The photon and neutron fluences are also shown in Figs. 1 and 4 for TP13, 2 and 5 for TP14, 3 and 6 for TP17. Those of TP19 are not reported since they do not significantly differ from the ones of TP17.

Comparing TP17 and TP19 it is clear that the copper plug will cause an increase of the overall hall background of the order of 10-15 %, with up to 30-40 % increase at some points in the first forward muon station, for all radiation components but muons. However muons are a significant fraction of the total rate at the highest rapidities and therefore such an increase is partially mitigated. It must be stressed that the percentage level of increase is strongly "configuration dependent", that is if a setup with levels comparable or even lower of the TP ones were designed, the effect of the heavy metal/copper switch for the plug could well amount to a 30-40 % increase in the whole hall.

From the tables, but even more from the plots it is easy to appreciate that TP14 was indeed a sharp deterioration of the TP setup, and that the introduction of the tile plug can partially recover the situation in that region. The effect of realistic assumptions on the shielding iron can be easily appreciated looking at the bump corresponding to the quadrupole collimator position which was not there in TP13.

## Appendix: Fluence vs Current

Results about radiation fields were customarily presented using two quantities, fluence and current (fluence rate and current rate for instantaneous quantities respectively). The last one is simply called rate when speaking about muon chamber background, since, as it is explained in the following, it directly gives the (charged) particle induced rate.

The subtle (but not so subtle!) distinction among these quantities always caused a huge amount of confusion since the early era of the SSC workshop on radiation problems (1987), since high energy physicists are not at all familiar with quantities used to characterize radiation fields.

This appendix is a desperate attempt to make it clear to everybody, shedding some light on the problem, please forgive the authors in case they do not succeed!

The definitions and names of quantities related to radiation fields have been issued by the International Commission for Radiological Units (ICRU). The basic physical quantity to define a radiation field is fluence. Among the many possible definitions, the following three are the most common and also the practical ones to be used for every real or Monte-Carlo "measurement" of fluence. They can be easily shown to be fully equivalent. All apply in principle to a specific point, though using suitable infinitesimal elements of surface or volume, all can be generalized in a straightforward way to a finite area or volume through suitable integrals.

* \(dN/dA_{perp}\): the number of particles crossing a surface element divided by the fraction of that element perpendicular to the particle direction. This is the most popular definition, even though it is not the most fundamental one and requires care since the surface element must be weighted taking into account the angle, \(\theta\), between the normal to the surface and the particle direction, \(dA_{perp}=dA\cos\theta\). It is straightforward to demonstrate that such a definition of fluence _does not_ depend on the specific surface element used for the "measurement", but it is only a function of the radiation field at the given point. It is also directly linked to the particles emerging from a point source, since the fluence around a given direction \(\Omega\) at a distance r is obviously given by \(1/r^{2}dN/d\Omega\).
* \(dl/dV\): the particle track length inside a volume element divided by that element. This is the fundamental definition. It is obvious from this definition that all physical effects of the radiation field, energy deposition (dose), interaction rate, activation, damage etc, are all proportional to the fluence.
* \(1/\Sigma\,dN_{coll}/dV\): the number of collisions (interactions) in a volume element, divided by that element and by the macroscopic cross section for that particle (\(1/\Sigma=\lambda\), mean free path). This definition can not be applied in vacuum and is a direct consequence of the fundamental one of the previous point. It has obvious practical implications in measuring neutral radiation fields, for example by means of activation detectors, or proportional counters sensitive to neutrons.

Fluence is therefore used every time deposited energy (dose), collision (hit) rates, damage, and activation are of interest.

Another quantity is sometimes useful, even though it is not a basic one and it is a function of the specific geometry of the surface under investigation: \(dN/dA\), that is the number of particles crossing a given surface element, divided by that element irrespective of the mutual orientation of the normal to the surface and the particle direction. This quantity has no "official" name issued by ICRU. The popular name for this "quantity" (actually it is not a function of the radiation field only, therefore it is not a physical quantity in the usual meaning) is current (current rate for instantaneous rate). Current is the quantity of interest every time one would like just to "count" the number of particles through a specific surface, regardless of the physical effects they will induce. Most people makes confusion between current and fluence considering as "fluence" what actually is "current", and at the same time attributing to "current" those effects (damage, collision rate, energy deposition) which are actually ruled by "fluence". To better illustrate the important difference between fluence and current, let us consider the simple situation of an aligned radiation field (a field where all particles are parallel) of unit fluence, and a test surface, \(dA\), put into such a field at different orientations. When the surface is perpendicular to the particle direction both fluence and current are given by \(dN/dA\) and are numerically the same and equal to one. As soon as the surface is tilted with respect to the beam, the current start to decrease since the number of particles intercepted is decreasing like the cosine of the angle between the normal to the surface and the particle direction. Fluence in deed remains constant and equal to one, since the decrease in \(dN\) is exactly compensated by the decrease in \(dA_{perp}\). In the limit of \(dA\) parallel to the particle direction, fluence is still the same, while current drops to zero. The example enlighten how the test surface used to actually "measure" fluence is immaterial, fluence being just a function of the radiation field in the given point, while its orientation has important effects on the measured "current". It is also clear that for whichever radiation field and surface, fluence is always equal or larger than current, their ratio ranging from one to infinity depending on the relative orientation of the test surface and of the radiation field.

Despite current is an ill-defined and surface dependent quantity, there are however situations where it can be of interest. A typical example is a counting experiment where some detector of given geometry is used to measure the number of charged particles produced in an interaction. Of course in this case the quantity one is looking for is current, even though the energy deposited in the detector as well as all other physical effects are related to fluence. From this example it is clear that current is of interest in situations where a sort of "digital" information is required. Concerning the radiation environment results, the charged particle induced hit rate in the muon stations is just this kind of situation, since the interest is on the number of hits rather than on the energy deposited in each of them. It must be stressed that for neutral particle in duced hits, where no direct ionization occurs, it is fluence of interest since the interaction rate is related to fluence and not to current. In the same way if one were interested in the energy released by charged particles into the tracking chambers, he should resort to fluence rather than to current. The same applies to the radiation field in the inner detector or in the calorimeters, where the interest is usually focussed on damage and therefore on fluence, regardless of the charge of the incident particles.

Finally, what about "flux"? Despite its popularity, according to ICRU recommendations flux should be banned from every scientific paper dealing with radiation, even though it is of wide use among non-specialists (and somewhere also in this note).
