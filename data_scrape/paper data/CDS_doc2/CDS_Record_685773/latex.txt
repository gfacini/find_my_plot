**Abstract**

Sample trigger menus are proposed for the ATLAS LVL1, LVL2, and LVL3 triggers for luminosity 10\({}^{33}\) cm-\({}^{2}\) s-1. These trigger menus are based on the ATLAS physics requirements. A catalog of physics processes studied by the ATLAS physics groups is included in an appendix, and trigger menu items for LVL1, LVL2, and LVL3 are proposed for each of these physics channels.

## 1 Introduction

The intention of this note is to propose full LVL1, LVL2, and LVL3 trigger menus for the ATLAS trigger for luminosity L=10\({}^{33}\) cm\({}^{-2}\) s\({}^{-1}\). These trigger menus are based on a catalog of physics processes studied by the ATLAS physics groups. The main references used for this catalog were the ATLAS Technical Proposal [1], the MSSM Higgs studies in Ref.[2], and recent SUSY Studies [3].

This note will be followed by a note describing the single-farm architecture for LVL2 (Architecture C) and a note proposing a model for LVL2 and LVL3 processing based on ATM switching networks. Notes describing the physics requirements, trigger menus, and processing model for high luminosity (10\({}^{34}\) cm\({}^{-2}\) s\({}^{-1}\)) will be prepared as soon as time permits.

## 2 Physics Processes

We have attempted to include in this note all the physics channels that have been analyzed by the ATLAS physics groups. We start with the physics channels discussed in Ref.[1]. Then we include additional analyses of MSSM Higgs channels from Ref.[2]. We have also tried to include SUSY physics channels discussed at the ATLAS SUSY Workshop in Stockholm in January 1996 [3] and the ATLAS LVL2 Workshop in Cracow in April 1996 [4]. We apologize for the inevitable errors and omissions of interesting physics channels and important references.

## 3 Trigger Algorithms

We have tried to make sure that each physics channel was represented by at least one trigger algorithm. We have not tried to list all possible triggers for each physics channel, although this would have been desirable. In many cases, additional overlapping trigger items are included in the full trigger menus, but have not been listed for each relevant physics channel. On the other hand, important trigger items have undoubtedly, and regrettably, been omitted. The authors would appreciate any comments which would help improve these trigger menus for later editions of this note.

## 4 Trigger Rates

The trigger rates indicated in this note are "best guess" trigger rates. When possible, rates are taken from the Technical Proposal and its backup documents [5],[6] and [7] for the muon triggers, [8],[9], and [10] for the calorimeter triggers. When a particular rate is unknown, we try to estimate it based on rejection factors that have been determined for less complex trigger algorithms. Real physics channels have been taken into account where possible, so that rates are not reduced below known physics channels such as leptonic decays of W's and Z's.

### Jets and Missing-E\({}_{\rm T}\)

There have been, and still are, problems with the jet trigger rates, because the LVL1 jet trigger algorithms are still poorly defined. In particular, the rates and the efficiencies for low-\(E_{T}\) jet triggers depend on decisions which have not yet been made. The rates used here are "best guesses" based on fast-simulation studies by J. Bystricky; they will be revised and up-dated as soon as the hardware trigger is better understood. The trigger items considered in this note are limited to no more than six jets; jet multiplicities up to at least ten will be considered in a future version of the note.

B-jet tagging is used in the LVL3 trigger menu. We assume that the B-jet tag gives a rejection for non-B jets by a factor 10 at LVL3 for low luminosity. This should be compared to the factor of 100 quoted in the Technical Proposal (Section 11.3.1) as a possible rejection factor for 50% efficiency for B jets with an \(E_{T}\) of 15 GeV.

The missing-\(E_{T}\) triggers, as the jet triggers, are poorly understood. M. Wunsch [11]has been studying the influence of signal shape and beam-crossing identification (BCID) on missing-\(E_{T}\). The LVL1 missing-\(E_{T}\) trigger rates used here are based on J. Bystricky's fast simulations and do not yet include pulse shaping and BCID. The LVL2 trigger rates which combine missing-\(E_{T}\) with other trigger objects are based on the missing-\(E_{T}\) resolution shown by Cavalli, et al, in Ref.[12]. We assume a missing-\(E_{T}\) resolution corresponding to a total \(E_{T}\) which is twice the sum of the \(E_{T}\) thresholds for the other trigger objects. Furthermore, we assume, conservatively, that the missing-\(E_{T}\) resolution for the LVL3 (or LVL2) trigger is about two-times bigger than the ultimate resolution shown by Cavalli, et al. Again, these trigger rates will be up-dated as more reliable estimates become available.

### B-Physics Triggers

The B-physics trigger rates used here are based on the Technical Proposal [1] and recent work by M. Smizanska [13]. The LVL2 trigger conditions are based on the trigger muon RoI and the full TRT scan. This LVL2 trigger does not require the analysis of new RoIs defined by the TRT full scan. The LVL3 trigger conditions do include the analysis of the new RoIs in the SCT tracker. This separation of LVL2 and LVL3 algorithms is formal; it does not imply that these algorithms will necessarily be implemented in separate processor farms.

## 5 Notation

The notation for the analysis and trigger conditions follows the notation used in the Technical Proposal. Trigger objects at LVL1 are indicated by capital letters; those at LVL2 (and in the physics analysis) are indicated by small letters. Some examples are given in the following table:The symbol "hh15" used in the B-physics menu items indicates that the combined \(p_{T}\) of the hadrons must exceed 15 GeV/c. Mass cuts and transverse mass cuts to select particle "X" are denoted M(X) and M\({}_{\rm T}\)(X) respectively.

## 6 Trigger Menus

The trigger levels referred to in this note have the following characteristics:

LVL1 refers to the standard LVL1 trigger. These LVL1 algorithms select events for the LVL1 trigger based on highly inclusive algorithms. The LVL1 trigger algorithms are based on low-\(p_{T}\) and high-\(p_{T}\) muons in the muon trigger chambers and on EM clusters, jets, and missing-\(E_{T}\) in the calorimeters. In addition, LVL1 trigger algorithms for narrow \(\tau\) jets have been included in the trigger menus presented here. LVL1.5 refers to flags set by the standard global LVL1 trigger processor. The LVL1.5 trigger rate is identical to the LVL1 trigger rate. The LVL1.5 flag signals those RoIs which are needed for the LVL2 algorithms. Use of the LVL1.5 flags reduces the number of RoIs that have to be processed by the (parallel or sequential)LVL2 processors. LVL2 refers to the standard LVL2 trigger. The LVL2 algorithms are more complex than those indicated in the Technical Proposal. In the Technical Propoposal, the LVL2 algorithms confirmed the LVL1 trigger, but they did not introduce information from non-trigger RoIs. The LVL2 algorithms presented here include the non-trigger RoIs flagged at LVL1 (referred to here as LVL1.5). On the other hand, missing-\(E_{T}\) calculations and B-jet tags (based on impact parameters) are defined as LVL3 algorithms.

* [LVL2.5] refers to flags which can be set at LVL2, but which do not significantly reduce the LVL2 trigger rate. If the LVL3 trigger algorithm is different from the LVL2 algorithm, but does not include missing-\(E_{T}\) or B-jet tags, then it is also listed as a LVL2.5 item.
* [LVL3] algorithms include missing-\(E_{T}\) calculations and B-jet tags. They may be executed in the same processor farm as the LVL2 algorithms, or in a separate LVL3 processor farm, depending on the LVL2 and LVL3 architectures.
* [LVL3.5] refers to flags which can be set at LVL3, but which do not significantly reduce the LVL3 trigger rate.

### LVL1 Trigger Menu at L=10\({}^{3}\)\({}^{3}\)

This standard LVL1 trigger menu is very similar to the LVL1 trigger menu in the T.P. The isolated EM cluster (which has already been included in the trigger simulation studies) has been added. A trigger item has been added. The jet and missing-\(E_{T}\) thresholds have been reconsidered, and the corresponding trigger rates have increased significantly. The 100 GeV jet trigger item now corresponds to a LVL1 threshold which will give 90% efficiency for LVL2 (or off-line) jets with \(E_{T}=100\) GeV. The total LVL1 trigger rate has been increased from the T.P. value of 23 kHz to the present value of 38.7 kHz, still a factor two below the CORE costing limit of 75 kHz.

The proposed LVL1 trigger menu for luminosity 10\({}^{33}\) cm-2 s-1 is shown in the following table:

\begin{tabular}{c c c} \hline \hline LVL1 & MU6 & 8 000 Hz \\ LVL1 & EM80 & 200 Hz \\ LVL1 & EM20I & 10 000 Hz \\ LVL1 & EM15I + EM15I & 2 500 Hz \\ LVL1 & TAU80 & 5 000 Hz \\ LVL1 & J100 & 8 000 Hz \\ LVL1 & J50 + J50 + J50 & 3 000 Hz \\ LVL1 & ME100 & 2 000 Hz \\ \hline \end{tabular}

The LVL1 trigger rate can be reduced slightly, from 38 700 Hz to 38 460 Hz, by correcting for certain overlapping trigger items, as discussed in the following section.

Note that the three-jet trigger is not required for the physics channels studied in this note; four jets could be required, with a reduced rate of 600 Hz. Likewise, the LVL1 missing \(E_{T}\) threshold could be raised to 150 GeV/c, with a rate of only 30 Hz. Both of these changes are compatible with the LVL2 trigger menu shown in Section 6.3. The revised LVL1 trigger rate would then be 34 330 Hz, or 34 270 Hz after corrections for overlapping trigger items.

### LVL1.5 Trigger Menu at L=10\({}^{3}\)\({}^{3}\)

The LVL1.5 trigger menu consists of a series of trigger flags to guide the LVL2 processing. Non-trigger RoIs found at LVL1 need not be processed at LVL2 unless they are required for one of the LVL1.5 trigger items. Many of these non-trigger RoIs are jets with \(E_{T}>15\)  GeV; the trigger rates for these 15  GeV jets is very poorly understood at this time, as discussed in Section 4 of this note.

The proposed LVL1.5 trigger menu items for luminosity 10\({}^{33}\) cm\({}^{-2}\) s\({}^{-1}\) are shown in the following table:

\begin{tabular}{l l r} \hline \hline LVL1 & MU6 & 8 000 Hz \\ LVL1.5 & MU20 & 400 Hz \\ LVL1.5 & MU20 + MU6 & 100 Hz \\ LVL1.5 & MU20 + MU20 & 20 Hz \\ LVL1.5 & MU20 + EM15I & 40 Hz \\ LVL1.5 & MU20 + TAU40 & 400 Hz \\ LVL1.5 & MU20 + J15 + J15 + J15 + J15 + J15 + J15 & 75 Hz \\ LVL1.5 & MU20 + J15 + J15 + J15 + J15 & 100 Hz \\ LVL1.5 & MU20 + J15 + J15 + J15 & 200 Hz \\ LVL1.5 & MU20 + J15 + J15 & 300 Hz \\ LVL1.5 & MU20 + J15 & 400 Hz \\ LVL1.5 & MU20 + J40 + J40 & 40 Hz \\ LVL1.5 & MU6 + EM15I & 800 Hz \\ LVL1.5 & MU6 + MU6 + MU6 & 400 Hz \\ LVL1.5 & MU6 + MU6 + MU6 & 20 Hz \\ LVL1.5 & MU6 + MU6 + EM15I & 40 Hz \\ LVL1.5 & MU6 + EM15I + EM15I & 40 Hz \\ LVL1.5 & MU6 + J15 + J15 + J15 + J15 + J15 + J15 & 1 500 Hz \\ LVL1.5 & MU6 + J15 + J15 + J15 + J15 + J15 & 2 000 Hz \\ LVL1.5 & MU6 + J15 + J15 + J15 & 3 000 Hz \\ LVL1.5 & MU6 + J15 + J15 + J15 & 4 000 Hz \\ LVL1.5 & MU6 + J15 + J15 & 6 000 Hz \\ LVL1 & EM80 & 200 Hz \\ LVL1.5 & EM80 + EM80 & 30 Hz \\ LVL1 & EM20I & 10 000 Hz \\ LVL1.5 & EM20I + TAU40 & 3 000 Hz \\ LVL1.5 & EM20I + J15 + J15 + J15 + J15 + J15 + J15 & 1 800 Hz \\ LVL1.5 & EM20I + J15 + J15 + J15 + J15 + J15 & 2 500 Hz \\ LVL1.5 & EM20I + J15 + J15 + J15 + J15 & 3 500 Hz \\ LVL1.5 & EM20I + J15 + J15 + J15 & 5 000 Hz \\ LVL1.5 & EM20I + J15 + J15 & 7 000 Hz \\ LVL1.5 & EM20I + J15 & 10 000 Hz \\ LVL1.5 & EM20I + J40 + J40 + J40 & 200 Hz \\ LVL1.5 & EM20I + J40 + J40 + J15 + J15 + J15 & 350 Hz \\ LVL1.5 & EM20I + J40 + J40 + J15 + J15 & 500 Hz \\ LVL1.5 & EM20I + J100 + J100 & 250 Hz \\ LVL1.1 & EM15I + EM15I & 2 500 Hz \\ LVL1.5 & EM15I + EM15I + EM7I & 1 000 Hz \\ LVL1 & TAU80 & 5 000 Hz \\ LVL1.5 & TAU150 & 1 000 Hz \\ LVL1.5 & TAU80 + TAU80 & 800 Hz \\ \hline \end{tabular}

\begin{tabular}{l l r} LVL1 & J100 & 8 000 Hz \\ LVL1.5 & J200 & 250 Hz \\ LVL1.5 & J100 + J100 & 2 000 Hz \\ LVL1.5 & J100 + J100 + ME100 & 300 Hz \\ LVL1.5 & J100 + J100 + J100 & 200 Hz \\ LVL1.5 & J100 + J150 + J15 + J15 + J15 + J15 & 2 000 Hz \\ LVL1.5 & J100 + J15 + J15 + J15 + J15 & 3 000 Hz \\ LVL1.5 & J100 + J15 + J15 + J15 & 4 000 Hz \\ LVL1 & J50 + J50 + J50 & 3 000 Hz \\ LVL1.5 & J50 + J50 + J50 + J50 & 600 Hz \\ LVL1.5 & J50 + J50 + J50 + J50 + J50 & 100 Hz \\ LVL1.5 & J50 + J50 + J50 + J50 + J50 + J50 & 20 Hz \\ LVL1 & ME100 & 2 000 Hz \\ LVL1.5 & ME150 & 30 Hz \\ \hline \multicolumn{3}{c}{TOTAL LVL1 (LVL1.5) TRIGER RATE} & 38 700 Hz \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}

Two of the LVL1.5 trigger items explicitly overlap more than one LVL1 trigger item. The item "MU6 + EM15I + EM15I" satisfies the LVL1 conditions "EM15I + EM15I" and "MU6". The item "J100 + J100 + J100" satisfies the LVL1 conditions "J100" and "J50 + J50 + J50". Correcting for this double-counting reduces the LVL1 trigger rate to 38 460 Hz.

There are a total of 51 LVL1.5 trigger menu items. The number of trigger thresholds required for each trigger object is given in the following table:

\begin{tabular}{l c c} \hline \hline  & \multicolumn{3}{c}{Number of thresholds} \\ \cline{3-3} Trigger object & LVL1 & LVL1.5 \\ \hline Low-\(p_{T}\) muon & 1 & 1 \\ High-\(p_{T}\) muon & 1 & 1 \\ EM cluster & 3 & 4 \\ Jet & 2 & 5 \\ \(\tau\), hadron & 1 & 2 \\ Missing-\(E_{T}\) & 1 & 2 \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}

## 7 Conclusions

Trigger menus for the LVL1, LVL2, and LVL3 ATLAS triggers at luminosity 10\({}^{33}\) cm-2 s-1 have been proposed in this note, based on the ATLAS physics requirements. A catalog of trigger algorithms proposed for each of the physics channels discussed by the ATLAS physics groups is included as an appendix to this note.

The trigger menus presented here are intended as an improvement over the simple trigger menus presented in the T.P. These trigger menus can be used to compare the performance expected from various LVL2 and LVL3 trigger architectures.

The LVL1 trigger rate presented here is about half of the 75 kHz limit. The high-\(p_{T}\) trigger rates are about 1.6 kHz at LVL2 (without missing-\(E_{T}\) recalculation and B-jet tags) and 100 Hz at LVL3. B physics increases these trigger rates to about 2.2 kHz at LVL2 and 200 Hz at LVL3. The current limit at 100 MB/s output to permanent storage should be reconsidered in light of improvements in hardware performance that can be expected with the revised LHC planning.

Trigger menus for luminosity 10\({}^{34}\) cm-2 s-1 will be prepared soon, based on a similar study of the ATLAS physics requirements at high luminosity.
