The prospects for observing an invisibly decaying Higgs boson in the \(t\bar{t}H\) production at LHC are discussed. An isolated lepton, reconstructed hadronic top-quark decay, two identified b-jets and large missing transverse energy are proposed as the final state signature for event selection. Only the Standard Model backgrounds are taken into account. It is shown that the \(t\bar{t}Z\), \(t\bar{t}W\), \(b\bar{b}Z\) and \(b\bar{b}W\) backgrounds can individually be suppressed below the signal expectation. The dominant source of background remains the \(t\bar{t}\) production. The key for observability will be an experimental selection which allows further suppression of the contributions from the \(t\bar{t}\) events with one of the top-quarks decaying into a tau lepton. Depending on the details of the final analysis, an excess of the signal events above the Standard Model background of about 10% to 100% can be achieved in the mass range \(m_{H}=100-200\) GeV. These correspond to the significance (poissonian estimate, statistical only) of 3.5 to 0.9.

Introduction

While several production and decay modes of the Higgs boson have already been studied in the past [1], the invisibly decaying Higgs boson has not yet been exhaustively discussed in the searches scenarios of the LHC experiments. There are however many different and reasonable theoretical ideas which implicate an invisibly decaying Higgs boson. These motivations include models with light neutralinos, spontaneously broken lepton number, radiatively generated neutrino masses, additional single scalar(s), or right handed neutrinos in the extra dimensions. For a nice recent overview see e.g. [2].

Some theoretical studies have already some time ago addressed the question of how to look for the evidence of an invisible Higgs decay. In [3] the use of the \(WH/ZH\) production mode was suggested. This analysis have been recently revisited in [4]. The observation of the invisibly decaying Higgs boson in the associated \(t\overline{t}H\) production has been proposed in [5]. Prospects for the observability of this decay mode in the Vector Boson Fusion production has been proposed and evaluated in [6]. The prospects for observability in the Vector Boson Fusion and in the \(WH/ZH\) production have been recently revisited with the ATLAS specific analyses in [7, 9] and [8] respectively.

In this paper the prospects for observation of an invisibly decaying Higgs in the \(t\overline{t}H\) production are revised. The evidence will be an excess of very exclusively selected events with a single isolated lepton, large missing transverse energy, two identified b-jets and one reconstructed top-quark in the hadronic decay mode. Such signature requires very dedicated work on understanding the systematic sources originating in both physics and detector simulation. Currently, all these aspects can certainly not be covered. The aim of this Note is rather to evaluate possible sources of the Standard Model backgrounds and to identify the dominant contributions thereof.

## 2 Signal and background processes

The proton-proton collisions at 14 TeV centre-of-mass energy are simulated, using the matrix element based generator AcerMC[10] and generalpurpose generators PYTHIA[11] and HERWIG[12] for event generation. The dominant reducible background, \(t\overline{t}\) production is generated with PYTHIA and HERWIG Monte Carlo. Other background processes, not available in general puppose generators: \(t\overline{t}Z\), \(t\overline{t}W\), \(b\overline{b}Z\), \(b\overline{b}W\), are generated with AcerMC generator and then processed with PYTHIA for hadronisation and decays.

The signal events, \(gg,q\bar{q}\to t\overline{t}H\), are generated with the PYTHIA event generator. No model for the invisibly decaying Higgs is assumed; the only postulate is that the Higgs boson is _invisible_ to the detector. The latter is equivalent to assuming a 100% branching ratio of the Higgs boson to invisible particles and the Standard Model prediction for the production cross-section. In addition, any assumptions on the mass/spin of the invisible decay products are omitted. The signal production in the mass range 100-200 GeV is analysed.

For simulation of the computationally demanding \(2\to 4\) background processes the presented study benefits from the availability of the matrix element implementations and efficient phase-space modeling in the AcerMC generator. Events generated with the matrix elements of AcerMC are further evolved through the QCD shower algorithms and eventually hadronised using the shower evolution provided by PYTHIA. In addition, the top-quark decays in the matrix element processes generated by AcerMC are handled by PYTHIA.

The CTEQ5L structure functions and the default settings of the initialisation parameters for PYTHIA and HERWIG are used. This includes option for the multi-interaction and minimum bias event, QCD scale and switches for the initial and final state radiation, choices for the factorisation and renormalisation scale. The cross-sections for signal and background processes are specified in Table 1.

The proposed analysis relies on identifying the top-quark pair production in the association with the invisibly decaying object and the lepton-hadron2 decay mode of the top-quark pair, where an isolated lepton will provide the trigger. In the initial step of the events selection one requires two identified (tagged) b-jets, at least two additional jets in the central detector region and a large missing transverse energy. The possible background processes are those which involve a top-quark pair or b-quark pair production associated with the W or Z-boson.

Footnote 2: _lepton-hadron_ denotes one top quark decaying \(t\to Wb\to q\overline{q}b\) and the other \(t\to Wb\to t\nu b\), where \(t\) stands for electron or muon.

\(\mathbf{gg,q\bar{q}}\,\rightarrow\mathbf{t\bar{t}}\) : This reducible continuum background is generated both with PYTHIA and HERWIG generators. As the implementations of the QCD showering/hadronisation models are different in PYTHIA and HERWIG, it is considered very interesting to study how the consistency of the estimates from both event samples, while the same initial cross-section is assumed3.

Footnote 3: The PYTHIA cross-section value is used throughout the analysis. The HERWIG cross-section prediction is lower by \(\sim\)17%, mainly due to the different implementation of \(\alpha\) QCD.

\begin{tabular}{|c||c|c|} \hline \hline Process & Generator & \(\sigma\) (\(\sigma\times BR\)) \\ \hline \hline \(t\overline{t}H\) & PYTHIA & \\ \(m_{H}=100\) GeV & & 910 fb \\ \(m_{H}=120\) GeV & & 520 fb \\ \(m_{H}=140\) GeV & & 320 fb \\ \(m_{H}=160\) GeV & & 210 fb \\ \(m_{H}=200\) GeV & & 100 fb \\ \hline \(t\overline{t}Z\), \(Z\rightarrow\nu\nu\) & AcerMC & 190 fb \\ \hline \(t\overline{t}\) & PYTHIA, HERWIG & 490 000 fb \\ \hline \(t\overline{t}W\), \(W\rightarrow\ell\nu\) & AcerMC & 140 fb \\ \hline \(bbW\), \(W\rightarrow\ell\nu\) & AcerMC & 73 000 fb \\ \hline \(bbZ\), \(Z/\gamma^{*}\rightarrow\ell\ell\) & AcerMC & 61 400 fb \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 1: _Cross-section for signal and background processes. Branching ratio is included only for hard-processes \(W\rightarrow\ell\nu\), \(Z\rightarrow\nu\nu\) and \(Z/\gamma^{*}\rightarrow\ell\ell\) decays (3 families of neutrinos and two families of leptons). For W-bosons from top-quarks all decay channels are included. For \(Z/\gamma^{*}\rightarrow\ell\ell\) we require that \(m_{\ell\ell}>\) 10 GeV. For the signal we assume the Standard Model Higgs production cross-section._\(\mathbf{q}\bar{\mathbf{q}}\to\mathbf{t}\bar{\mathbf{t}}\mathbf{W},\mathbf{W}\to \ell\nu:\) This reducible background is generated with the AcerMC matrix element generator. In the implemented matrix element the W-boson from the hard process is forced to decay into a lepton and neutrino. As the required lepton can also be produced in the semi-leptonic top-quark decays, the hard-process W-boson could thus also decay hadronically; consequently the generated background is multiplied by a combinatorial factor three in the final results. This approximation is acceptable under the assumption that the acceptance is roughly comparable for events involving either a leptonic decay of the W-boson from the hard process or a leptonic decay of a W-boson from top-quark decays. This is an acceptable assumption as already the initial cross-section for this process is comparable with the signal values and the irreducible \(t\bar{t}Z\) background predictions. Even with the combinatorial factor three included, the \(t\bar{t}W\) background contribution is expected to be on the order of the \(t\bar{t}Z\) contribution at most.

\(\mathbf{g}\mathbf{g},\mathbf{q}\bar{\mathbf{q}}\to\mathbf{b}\mathbf{b}\mathbf{ Z}/\gamma^{*},\mathbf{Z}/\gamma^{*}\to\ell\ell:\) This reducible background is generated with the AcerMC matrix element generator. The \(Z/\gamma^{*}\) is required to decay into a lepton pair. This background process is considered to reproduce quite reliably the estimates from the inclusive 'Z-boson \(\oplus\) jets' production. Recent study in [13] has shown that the rates for \(Zb\bar{b}\) events agree within 10% with the predictions of the more inclusive approach of generating \(q\bar{q}\to Z\) hard processes and invoking parton shower afterwards. Requiring a reconstruction of one top-quark in the hadronic mode, large missing transverse energy and vetoing additional lepton will strongly suppress this background.

\(\mathbf{q}\bar{\mathbf{q}}\to\mathbf{b}\bar{\mathbf{b}}\mathbf{W},\mathbf{W} \to\ell\nu:\) This reducible background is generated with the AcerMC matrix element generator. The W boson is required to decay to a lepton and neutrino. This background represents the lowest limit of what is expected from the 'inclusive W \(\oplus\) jets' production. Recent study in [13] has shown that the more inclusive, parton shower based estimates for events with two b-jets and one isolated lepton, are not exceeding the matrix element results by more than a factor two. Requiring reconstruction of one top-quark in the hadronic mode and a large transverse missing energy will suppress it strongly.

The list presented above, although quite exhaustive already, does not include different reducible backgrounds with one or two misidentified b-jets. From the experience of several studies done in [1], one does not expect these backgrounds to contribute more than 20-30% of the respective backgrounds with two true b-quarks.

In the presented analysis about \(10^{8}\) unweighted events were generated for the \(t\bar{t}\) process with PYTHIA and HERWIG and about \(10^{6}\) for each of the background processes generated with AcerMC.

## 3 Fast detector simulation

For the purpose of this analysis we use fast detector simulation [14], of the ATLAS detector at LHC. It reads generated events and provides reconstructed experimental observables: isolated leptons, jets, identified b-jets, transverse energy. Isolated leptons are reconstructed within pseudorapidity of \(|\eta|<2.5\), the same pseudorapidity coverage is possible for b-jets identification. Jets are reconstructed within \(|\eta|<5.0\). We require transverse momenta threshold for trigger muon of 20 GeV, for trigger electron of 25 GeV and threshold for jets reconstruction of 15 GeV. Additional leptons are vetoed with the threshold of 6 GeV for muon and 10 GeV for electron. Conservatively we assume 90% efficiency for lepton identification and reconstruction, around 80% efficiency for jets reconstruction and 60% efficiency for b-jet identification (with misidentification probability of 1% for light jets and 10% for c-jets). Resolution of the reconstructed missing transverse energy components is of about 7 GeV (reference value for di-jet events with \(p_{T}^{hard}>17\) GeV).

## 4 Analysis

The invisibly decaying Higgs boson production in association with two top-quarks leads to a very distinct signature, namely the large missing transverse energy and an accompanying top-quark pair. Requiring a fully or partially reconstructed top-quark pair will allow for strong suppression of backgrounds from W or Z production, leaving the \(t\bar{t}\) background as the dominant one. The (reducible) top-quark background production rate is enormous, the initial cross-section is by factor \(5\times 10^{2}-5\times 10^{3}\) higher then the signal one. The only notable distinction between the signal events and the \(t\bar{t}\) events should be a much larger missing transverse energy. Therefore, a selection which implies accepting the purest possible sample with fully reconstructed hadronic top-quark decay and partially reconstructed semi-leptonic top decay is proposed.

The focal point of the proposed selection is to suppress as much as possible the contribution from events with one \(t\to\ell\nu b\) and another \(t\to\tau\nu b\) decay, which results in presence of lepton and a a large transverse missing energy in the event.

* An isolated lepton from the semi-leptonic decay of the one top-quark is required to provide trigger for these events. In addition, a veto on events with an additional isolated lepton is set in order to suppress the \(Z/\gamma^{*}b\bar{b}\) background.
* Both b-jets have to be identified (tagged), which efficiently reduces background from the inclusive Z- or W-boson production.
* One top-quark reconstructed in the hadronic decay mode \(t\to jjb\) is required. The best \(jjb\) combination is chosen from the set of possible permutations, the criteria being \(m_{jj}=m_{W}\pm 15\) GeV and \(|\eta^{jet}|<2.0\). Taking only the central jets for \(W\to jj\) reconstruction reduces the fraction of events with "fake" reconstruction of the "\(W\to jj\)", where the jets originate in the initial or final state QCD radiation and not in the W-boson decay. We apply a W-mass constraint in order to re-calibrate the four-momenta of jets as this optimises the resolution of the reconstructed \(jjb\) system. The \(jjb\) system is considered to reconstruct a top-quark if \(m_{jjb}=m_{t}\pm 25\) GeV.
* It is not feasible, without further assumptions, to require a full reconstruction of the semi-leptonically decaying top-quark in signal events. For such a reconstruction one needs information on the missing transverse energy from the W-boson decay. The latter is however not available, as both the leptonic W-boson decay and the Higgs boson decay itself contribute to the missing transverse energy in those events. Instead, we decided to explore the fact that the expected transverse mass of the lepton and \(E_{T}^{miss\,s}\) system, \(m_{T}(\ell,E_{T}^{miss\,s})\), is much higher in the signal than in the \(t\bar{t}\) background events, see Fig 1. For the \(t\bar{t}\) events, with the missing transverse energy coming predominantly from the \(W\to\ell\nu\) decay, one can observe characteristic sharp end-point in the \(E_{T}^{miss\,s}\) distribution at about the W-boson mass. The tail in this distribution is contributed mostly by events with one \(W\to\tau\nu\) decay or with both W-bosons decaying \(W\to\ell\nu\). For selection we require \(m_{T}(\ell,E_{T}^{miss})>120\) GeV.
* A relatively large missing transverse energy of the system, \(E_{T}^{miss}>150\) GeV, is required.
* The signal-to-background ratio is enhanced by the additional requirement of the large transverse momenta in the reconstructed system, \(\sum p_{T}^{\rm rec}>250\) GeV. The \(\sum p_{T}^{\rm rec}=\sum p_{T}^{j}+p_{T}^{l}\) where the sum runs over the transverse momenta of reconstructed objects from top-quarks decays: two b-jets, two light jets used for the reconstruction of the \(W\to q\bar{q}\) decay and an isolated lepton. This further suppresses the backgrounds where true top quarks are not present, like \(b\bar{b}Z\) and \(b\bar{b}W\).
* Finally, further enhancement of the signal-to-background ratio can be achived by the additional requirement on the cone separation, \(R_{jj}\), between jets which were used for the \(W\to jj\) reconstruction, the \(R_{jj}<\) 2.2.

In Table 2 the selection criteria and cumulative acceptances from signal and dominant background processes are specified. The selection cutoff \(E_{T}^{miss}>150\) GeV is quite loose and certainly can be optimised further. The cumulative acceptance for signal events after these cuts is about 0.3%. The acceptance is indeed very similar for the \(t\bar{t}H\) signal events at \(m_{H}=1\,20\) GeV and for the \(t\bar{t}Z\) background events. The cumulative acceptance for the \(t\bar{t}\) process is of \(7.6\cdot 10^{-6}\) for PYTHIA events and \(1.2\cdot 10^{-5}\) for HERWIG events.

The distributions before the \(R_{jj}\) selection step specified in Table 1 are shown. The distributions are normalised to the number of events expected for an integrated luminosity of \(30fb^{-1}\)._After performing the selection, in the PYTHIA sample about 70% of the \(t\bar{t}\) events comes from the lepton-tau 4 decay, 20% from the lepton-lepton decay of the top-quark pair, remaining 10% from lepton-hadron decays. Compatible relative fractions are found also in HERWIG events. In the cases of _lepton-tau_ and _lepton-lepton_ decays the \(jjb\) combination is thus made from the ISR/FSR jets and not from the true \(W\to q\bar{q}\) decays. The absolute contribution of such events certainly will be sensitive to the real NLO corrections.

Footnote 4: The _lepton-tau_ label denotes one top quark decaying \(t\to Wb\to\ell\nu b\) and another \(t\to Wb\to\tau\nu b\), where \(\ell\) stands for electron or muon. The _lepton-lepton_ decay labels events with both top quarks decaying \(t\to Wb\to\ell\nu b\). Finally, the _lepton-hadron_ decay labels events with one top quark decaying \(t\to Wb\to\ell\nu b\) and another \(t\to Wb\to q\bar{q}b\)

These events could hopefully be suppressed further by implementing a tau-jet veto and with more stringent requirements in the \(t\to jjb\) reconstruction. The cumulative acceptance for the \(t\bar{t}\) background is found to be about 50% higher for events generated with HERWIG than with PYTHIA generator. The signal events in contrast contain only a \(\sim 10\%\) fraction of lepton-tau and lepton-lepton decays; the relative fractions of signal and \(t\bar{t}\) background events are shown in Figure 4.

The results for \(t\bar{t}\) events simulated with PYTHIA and HERWIG generators are shown. The distributions are normalised to the number of events expected for an integrated luminosity of \(30fb^{-1}\)._

Considering the relative fractions of the tau-lepton events in the signal and background, one can assume that the inter-jet cone separation, \(R_{\rm jj}\), might provide some additional separation power; the \(R_{\rm jj}\) for signal and \(t\overline{t}\) background events are given in Figure 4. Subsequently, a loose cut of \(R_{\rm jj}<2.2\) was applied; the final efficiencies are listed in Table 2.

The expected numbers of events for an integrated luminosity of \(30fb^{-1}\) are given in Table 3. Several values of the Higgs boson masses are studied, while assuming the Standard Model production cross-sections. Please note that at present the 50% systematic uncertaintity should be considered just from the Monte Carlo event generation used to estimate the \(t\bar{t}\) background. From those numbers one can estimate signal significance (poissonian estimate, statistical only) to be of 3.5 to 0.9 for \(30fb^{-1}\).

Taking as an example the results for the \(t\bar{t}\) background obtained with PYTHIA generator, the signal-to-background ratio is about 39% for Higgs boson mass of 100 GeV and about 9% for the Higgs mass of 200 GeV. The total number of expected events from all backgrounds, but the \(t\bar{t}\) one, is on the level of the signal itself. It is evident that in case the "fake" reconstructions could be eliminated in the \(t\bar{t}\) events, the signal-to-background ratio could be brought to e.g. 90% for the \(m_{\,H}\) = 120 GeV, without changing thresholds on the \(E_{T}^{miss}\).

In Figure 2 the expected final (post-selection) distribution of the \(E_{T}^{miss}\) and \(\,\sum p_{T}^{\rm rec}\) is shown for the Higgs mass of 120 GeV. One can clearly see that the shape of the \(E_{T}^{miss}\) distribution is much steeper for the \(t\bar{t}\) events than for the signal ones. In addition, the shape of the \(\sum p_{T}^{\rm rec}\) distribution is different for both classes of events and in fact the applied threshold 250 GeV is shown to be rather low. One may also expect that the shape of the \(\sum p_{T}^{\rm rec}\) (or analogous) distributions will be sensitive to the Higgs boson mass, thus allowing for the extraction of that information with some precision, limited by the signal-to-background ratio.

One can certainly increase the signal-to-background ratio by rising thresholds on the \(R_{\rm jj}\), \(E_{T}^{miss}\), \(\sum p_{T}^{\rm rec}\) or other reconstructed visible observables, like e.g. the total transverse momenta of the top-quark and lepton system, \(P_{T}^{\rm rec}\), or transverse momenta of the top-quark, \(p_{T}^{top}\). Taking as the reference the distributions shown in Figure 3, increasing the threshold on the \(E_{T}^{miss}\) to about 250 GeV would result in increasing the signal-to-background ratio (only \(t\bar{t}\) background) to about one, while still keeping the expected number of signal events to about 20.

One can also increase signal-to-background ratio by further optimising the selection criteria, e.g. by asking for an isolation in the azimuthal angle of the \(E_{T}^{miss}\) direction from the reconstructed jets, reconstructed top-quark or the isolated lepton. It has been checked that the moderate isolation requirement, \(\delta\phi>0.4\), can improve signal-to-background ratio by 20-30% at the price of reducing signal rates by a comparable amount.

Nevertheless, in our opinion, the key point for the signal observability remains the experimental efficiency for reducing the fake \(W\to q\vec{q}\) reconstruction and thus the contribution from the \(t\bar{t}\) events with lepton-tau and lepton-lepton decays.

## Conclusions

The prospects for observing the invisibly decaying Higgs boson in the \(t\bar{t}H\) production at LHC were discussed. The proposed analysis required one top-quark reconstructed in the hadronic decay mode, an isolated lepton (electron, muon) from the decay of the second top-quark and a large missing transverse energy. Evidence for signal would be an observation of an excess of such events above the background. Expected excess can be on the level from 10% to even 100% or more, depending on the required threshold on the missing transverse energy and on the assumed Higgs boson mass. It can be expected that some sensitivity to the Higgs boson mass could be revealed by the hardness of the reconstructed visible part of the event, the \(\sum p_{T}^{\rm rec}\), \(P_{T}^{\rm rec}\) or similar distributions. The signal observability should not degrade significantly for the high-luminosity operation of the detectors as both signal and background contributions are dominated by true \(E_{T}^{miss}\) with high lower threshold. Thus, the sensitivity to the signal is expected to rise with the increasing collected integrated luminosity.

The availability of the matrix element implementations for \(t\bar{t}Z\), \(t\bar{t}W\), \(t\bar{t}Z\) and \(t\bar{t}W\) processes in the AcerMC generator allowed to conclude that the total contribution from these background processes could be kept on the level or below the signal one.

The dominant Standard Model background comes from the \(t\bar{t}\) production with one top-quark decaying semi-leptonically into electron or muon and the second one into tau-lepton. It was also shown, by comparing results for the \(t\bar{t}\) background generated with PYTHIA and HERWIG Monte Carlo, that for the final estimate one would have to study very carefully systematics from the showering, hadronisation and decays models. The key to reduce the \(t\bar{t}\) background further will be the purest possible reconstruction of the top-quark hadronic decays (\(t\to q\bar{q}b\)), thus eliminating the events with the top-quark decaying to tau-lepton (\(t\to\tau\nu b\)).

It was concluded that the final optimisation of the observability potential demands much more sophisticated experimental analysis than foreseen in the scope of this paper. Rather than increasing threshold on the required missing transverse energy one should aim for the best possible suppression of the contribution from the tau-lepton events of the top-quark pair decays. Let us also stress, that at present just from the Monte Carlo generators used we observed the 50% systematic uncertaintity on the predictions for the dominant \(t\bar{t}\) backround.

In Table 4 a comparison between the sensitivity to the invisible Higgs production in the \(t\bar{t}H\) channel and in the \(qq\to qqH\) vector boson fusion (VBF) published in [7] is given in terms of the sensitivity of the \(\xi^{2}\) parameter:

\[\xi^{2}\,=\frac{[\sigma({\rm t\bar{t}H})\times{\rm Br}({\rm H}\to{\rm inv})]^{ 95}}{\sigma\bigl{(}{\rm t\bar{t}H}\bigr{)}_{\rm SM}}\]

The parameter \(\xi^{2}\), as defined in [7] and presented in Table 4, serves as an estimate of the branching fraction \({\rm Br}({\rm H}\to{\rm inv})\). It is derived from the fact that since the true \(\sigma({\rm t\bar{t}H})\) is also not known _a priori_, one is restricted to measuring the \(\sigma({\rm t\bar{t}H}\to{\rm inv})=\sigma({\rm t\bar{t}H})\times{\rm Br}({\rm H }\to{\rm inv})\) and thus the \({\rm Br}({\rm H}\to{\rm inv})\) estimate has to be scaled by the ratio between the unknown cross-section and the Standard Model prediction \(\sigma({\rm t\bar{t}H})_{\rm SM}\). The Table 4 lists the sensitivity limits of the \(\xi^{2}\) which can be probed at 95% confidence level. In the same table, the limits published in [9] for the VBF production process have been re-scaled for consistency to luminosity of \(30{\rm fb}^{-1}\); in case the data point was not provided the nearest value was taken.

The presented values of \(\xi^{2}\) do not contain the estimates of systematic uncertainties since the level of uncertainty about the background predictions is in our opinion still too large, as it is evident from the difference between PYTHIA and HERWIG predictions for the \(t\bar{t}\) background. It might well be, that for more firm background estimates one might have to wait for the availability of NLO Monte-Carlo generators and/or tuning on the data itself. Let us also stress that in the present considerations we have not addressed the other possible background source than Standard Model production. Eg. the SUSY background should be carefully evaluated for the final evaluation of the observability prospects in the SUSY scenarios.

It is nevertheless evident that even if an efficient way to reject events with _fake_\(W\to jj\) reconstruction (topological selection, tau-jet veto) is found the potential for invisible Higgs detection in the \(t\overline{t}H\) channel is about a factor two to three weaker than with the VBF channel [7] in the low-mass Higgs region while in the high-mass region the clear VBF dominance is evident. One has to stress, however that the \(t\overline{t}H\) channel does not require the implementation of an efficient forward jet trigger essential for the VBF studies as stated in [7] and that with more stringent cut optimisation it might be still possible to significantly increase the sensitivity listed in Table 4.

The associated Higgs production \(t\overline{t}H\) already turned to be very powerful for the \(H\to b\overline{b}\) decay mode [15]. Establishing the observability in the same production mode and the complementary decay channel (if \(H\to inv\) is open the \(H\to b\overline{b}\) is suppressed) will make this search very interesting in the range of the intermediate strength of both decays.
