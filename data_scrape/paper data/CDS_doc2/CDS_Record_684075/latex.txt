## 1 Introduction

Using the Finite Element Method (FEM) with ANSYS code, thermal simulations related to the runaway problem [1] for the ATLAS-SCT forward modules have been carried out. In an earlier note [2] the similar problem of the cooling of the SCT forward modules was also explored using the assumption that the power dissipation in the silicon detectors is uniformly distributed. In [2], on the basis of what was known at that time, a number of changes to the module design were suggested.

As in [2], this note first investigates the thermal characteristics of the base-line design [1]. It is then shown that some changes to the existing module and cooling block design could significantly improve the thermal characteristics of the forward modules.

## 2 Module Components.

The forward modules have been assumed to be constructed using the materials shown in Table 1 (t = thickness, k = the thermal conductivity):

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|c|} \hline  & & & Thermal \\
**Item** & **Material** & **Thichness t** & conductivity k \\  & & (mm) & (W/m/\({}^{6}\)K) \\ \hline Hybrid & BeO & 0.50 & 260 \\ \hline Silicon wafers & Si & 0.30 & 136 \\ \hline Adhesive & Araldite & 0.05 & 0.42 \\ \hline Spine & TPG & 0.50 & 1700 (in plane) \\  & & & 8 (out of plane) \\ \hline Mechanical & AIN & 0.50 & 180 \\ bridges & & & \\ \hline Thermal separation & Quartz & 0.30 & 1.50 \\  & (glass) & & \\ \hline Positioning elements & PEEK & - & 0.25 \\ \hline Thermal connection & Grease & 0.025 & 0.40 \\ \hline Cooling Block & Aluminium & - & 190 \\ \hline Cooling Pipe & CuNi or & 0.2 wall & 29 \\  & Aluminium & 0.2 wall & 190 \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}

## 3 Method of modelling.

For some parts of the module and the cooling blocks it is assumed that the temperature is constant through the thickness of the sub-element considered. This allows the use of two dimensional simulations for these elements.

On the other hand, the silicon wafers are treated as three-dimensional thermal-electric elements. This means that the temperature distribution in the wafers is determined from the flow of direct electric current. Furthermore, the electrical conductivity of the wafers depends on the temperature. The ANSYS code, which is based on the finite element method (FEM), allows a coupled-field analysis that uses coupled-field elements.

The thermal resistances of the glue layers at the interfaces of Si\(\cdot\)AIN, quartz-AIN and quartz-BeO, have been estimated by separate numerical calculations and then introduced to the model of the modules.

The FEM model of the outer forward module for the SCT detector is shown in Figure 1. It represents the baseline design. In the modelling of the cooling blocks it is assumed that the aluminium cooling pipe has an outer diameter of 4 mm and a wall thickness of 0.2 mm at the connection to the cooling block. At the top surfaces of the cooling block, it is assumed that the module contact is made using a grease contact of thickness 0.025 mm.

Figure 5: Temperature distribution after 10 years of operation, detectors of the outer module with a 5mm gap.

It is seen that with the split cooling block, both of the cooling blocks on the silicon wafers are used to cool the wafers at the beginning of the detector operation, and that the temperature variation across the silicon is reduced to 3 \({}^{\rm o}\)C. After 10 years of operation, the temperature variation is still \(<5\)\({}^{\rm o}\)C. On the other hand, by using the split cooling block the heat transfer from the hybrid to the silicon wafers has been increased from 0.31 W to 0.45 W.

If quartz glass is used to replace the AlN cross-bar at the junction to the fan-in, the extreme temperature of the silicon wafer increases by approximately 1\({}^{9}\)C; this option could provide some price advantage, but with a limited deterioration of the wafer temperature variation.

## 5 Additional changes to the module design.

The design changes proposed in the above sections were:

a) an increase of the gap between the hybrid and silicon wafers from 2 mm to 5 mm,

b) the use of a split cooling block, and

c) a modification of the fan-in shape.

At a fixed liquid temperature (the critical temperature for the base-line design) of -21.05 \({}^{\mathrm{o}}\)C, this resulted in a temperature reduction on the module by 6.6 \({}^{\mathrm{o}}\)C during initial operation,

Results are also shown at the critical temperature of -17.5 \({}^{\mathrm{o}}\)C.

10.6 \({}^{0}\)C after 10 LHC operational years. Further improvements can be made in the thermal behaviour of the module: indicative improvements are shown below; detailed design modelling of the TPG shape might further optimise the temperature uniformity on the silicon wafers.

To improve the heat transfer along the TPG, the case of butt-jointed AlN bridge pieces to the TPG of the central spine (as opposed to inserts for the baseline design) is considered. The TPG is now 0.5 mm thick, except at both ends where the thickness is approximately 0.225 mm. Figures 12 and 13 show the temperature distributions of the outer module, at the beginning of operation and after a 10-year operational period. Some key module operational parameters are listed in Table 6; when compared with the results of Table 5, a small improvement of the wafer temperature uniformity is predicted.

More important is the effect of a 20mm width TPG spine. The estimated maximum wafer temperature and the temperature uniformity is shown in Table 7, and the temperature profiles of the module are shown in Figures 14 and 15. After introducing all the changes described above, the critical temperature is -15 \({}^{0}\)C, 6 \({}^{0}\)C above that for the base-line design using 2-point cooling, and 2.5 \({}^{0}\)C above that shown in Table 5. The module performance after 10 operational LHC years is in this case shown in Table 7, and the temperature profile on the module is shown in Figure 16.

## 6 Conclusions

The Ansys calculations described in this note indicate that:

a) Using the existing baseline outer module and cooling block arrangement, a coolant temperature of less than -21.05 \({}^{0}\)C is required.

b) The variation of the sensor temperature across the surface of the outer module is not satisfactory for the baseline design.

c) By changes to the module design (an increased separation between the sensors and the hybrid, changing shape of the fan-in and using a split cooling block), these problems can be significantly alleviated. The maximum temperature on the silicon wafers is reduced from -2.5 \({}^{0}\)CC to -13.9 \({}^{0}\)C and the maximum temperature variation across the silicon wafers is reduced from 10.2 \({}^{0}\)CC to 4.1 \({}^{0}\)C, after 10 years of LHC operation. In addition, the critical temperature of the fluid is 3.55 \({}^{0}\)C higher (-17.5 \({}^{0}\)C as compared with -21.05 \({}^{0}\)C).

Further small changes to the module design, explicitly the use of a 20mm width TPG spine and butt joints for the AlN mechanical bridges to the TPG spine, reduces the critical temperature to -15 \({}^{0}\)C, and slightly improves the temperature uniformity of the silicon wafer.

This study has been made for the case of 2-point cooling, using the outer module. The case of the inner module, where the baseline design requires 1-point cooling, will be discussed in
