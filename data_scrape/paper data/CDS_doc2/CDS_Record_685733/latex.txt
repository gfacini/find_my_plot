The measurement of coordinate along sense wire is based on the time difference of signal arrival to opposite sides of a sense wire. The test was performed in JET-c61l drift chamber, described in /1/ with gas mixture Ar+6%CO2.

The scheme of measurement is shown in fig.1, where 1,2,3,4 are the sense wires of 6m length. The wires! and 4 are connected at opposite from amplifier side in series. Letter "A" denotes the amplifier with coefficient 100, "D" is constant fraction discriminator, TDC - time-to-digital converter with 12 bites range. The ionization in chamber was created by pulsed X-ray source, intensity of which was adjusted to have small probability of simultaneous signals for wires! and 4. So, the distance from sense wire avalanche to the 1st amplifier was 3m and 9m to the 2nd one.

2. RESULTS

The distribution of time difference is shown in fig.2. There are 2 peaks: the 1st one corresponds to the signal at the 1st sense wire and the 2nd peak is caused by signal at wire 4. The difference between peaks correspond to distance of 6 m along sense wire. The 2nd peak is shown in fig.3 with large magnification. The inverse velocity of signal propagation along wire is 3.8! ns/m. The resolution of coordinate along wire is 5.6cm. The dependence of resolution of coordinate along wire and probability of appearance of signal at the 4th wire are shown in fig.4 versus of sense wire potential. The voltage for potential wires was 1.8 kV and the threshold of discriminator was 1mV with respect of amplifier input; the input impedance of amplifier was 300 Om.

3. CONCLUSIONS AND PLANS.

The performed work is the first attempt to measure coordinate along wire in JET-cell drift chamber. The achieved resolution of 5.5cm is quite well.

We'll consider: 1) to perform the same measurements with cosmic tracks; 2) to modify the constant fraction discriminator; 3) to change the gas mixture and to optimize the voltages of chamber.

We suppose that after the modifications the resolution about of 3 - 3.5 cm can be achieved.
