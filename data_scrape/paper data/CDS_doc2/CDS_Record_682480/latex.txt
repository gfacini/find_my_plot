**Abstract**

In this note the discovery potential to observe right-handed W gauge bosons in the decay mode to two electrons and two jets is discussed. A right-handed W can decay semileptonically into an electron and a right-handed neutrino. If it is massive enough this neutrino can interm decay to an electron and a quark-antiquark pair. Having reconstructed the neutrinos, its polarisation can be studied and one can distinguish whether the neutrino and its antiparticle are the same (Majorana) or different (Dirac) particles.

Introduction

In this note the experimental possibilities to observe right-handed W gauge bosons and massive right-handed neutrinos are discussed. These particles appear in some extensions of the Standard Model (SM). The simplest extensions are the left-right symmetric models (LRM) based on the gauge group \(\mathrm{SU}(2)_{\mathrm{L}}\times\mathrm{SU}(2)_{\mathrm{R}}\times\mathrm{U}(1)\)[2]. Compared to the SM, three new gauge bosons (\(\mathrm{W}_{\mathrm{R}}^{\pm}\), \(\mathrm{Z}_{\mathrm{R}}\)) and neutrinos (\(\mathrm{N}_{\mathrm{R},e}\), \(\mathrm{N}_{\mathrm{R},\mu}\), \(\mathrm{N}_{\mathrm{R},\tau}\)) are predicted. In the simplest case the neutrino is massless and will leave the detector without trace. Supposing the right-handed neutrino is heavy, as predicted by the see-saw mechanism, it will decay into lighter particles. Two different types of neutrinos have to be distinguished, Majorana neutrinos (\(\mathrm{N}_{\mathrm{R}}=\overline{\mathrm{N}}_{\mathrm{R}}\)) and Dirac neutrinos (\(\mathrm{N}_{\mathrm{R}}\neq\overline{\mathrm{N}}_{\mathrm{R}}\)). In the following the neutrino is assumed to be massive. The semileptonic \(\mathrm{W}^{\prime}\) decay to an electron and a massless neutrino has been studied in [1]. The event signatures for \(\mathrm{W}_{\mathrm{R}}\)'s are identical. For the production and the decay of \(\mathrm{W}^{\prime}\)'s and \(\mathrm{W}_{\mathrm{R}}\)'s the couplings are proportional to \(\mathrm{g}_{\mathrm{V}}^{2}\) and \(\mathrm{g}_{\mathrm{A}}^{2}\). Hence, there is no difference between a \(\mathrm{V}-\mathrm{A}\) and a \(\mathrm{V}+\mathrm{A}\) structure, not even in the decay angular distributions, in pp collisions.

Right-handed W\({}_{\mathrm{R}}\)'s decay either into a quark-antiquark pair or into a lepton and a massive right-handed neutrino (\(\mathrm{W}_{\mathrm{R}}\to\mathrm{l}\mathrm{N}_{\mathrm{R},l},\mathrm{l}=\mathrm{ e},\mu,\tau\)). The \(\mathrm{N}_{\mathrm{R}}\) is assumed to decay promptly into a mode which depends on the mixing angle \(\chi\) between \(\mathrm{W}_{\mathrm{L}}\) and \(\mathrm{W}_{\mathrm{R}}\). This mixing angle is less than \(0.013\)[3], hence, it is sufficient to discuss only the case of no mixing, \(\chi=0\). In this case \(\mathrm{N}_{\mathrm{R}}\)'s decay into a lepton and an off-shell \(\mathrm{W}_{\mathrm{R}}^{*}\), \(\mathrm{N}_{\mathrm{R},l}\to\mathrm{l}\mathrm{W}_{\mathrm{R}}^{*}\). The \(\mathrm{W}_{\mathrm{R}}^{*}\) decays into quarks (\(\mathrm{W}_{\mathrm{R}}^{*}\to\mathrm{q}\overline{\mathrm{q}}^{\prime}\)) or in the case of \(\mathrm{N}_{\mathrm{R},\mu}\) and \(\mathrm{N}_{\mathrm{R},\tau}\) the \(\mathrm{W}_{\mathrm{R}}^{*}\) can decay into a lighter lepton and the corresponding massive neutrino. In this note only the electron channel is considered. Moreover, the other heavy neutrinos are assumed to be heavier than \(\mathrm{N}_{\mathrm{R},e}\) and hence their cross section is even lower. The precision on the energy for high energetic leptons is better for electrons than for muons. Nevertheless, the same arguments presented here can be used to reconstruct a heavy muon neutrino in the muon channel. In the following electron stands for electron and positron as well.

Up to now no evidence for the production of right-handed W bosons was found. The current direct limits are set by DO[4]. Regardless of the \(\mathrm{N}_{\mathrm{R}}\) decay and under the assumption of SM couplings (\(\mathrm{g}_{\mathrm{R}}=\mathrm{g}_{\mathrm{L}}\)) they find at 95% confidence level:

\[\mathrm{m}(\mathrm{W}_{\mathrm{R}})>650\mathrm{~{}GeV} \mathrm{~{}for~{}~{}m}(\mathrm{N}_{\mathrm{R}})<0.5\cdot\mathrm{m}( \mathrm{W}_{\mathrm{R}}),\] \[\mathrm{m}(\mathrm{W}_{\mathrm{R}})>720\mathrm{~{}GeV} \mathrm{~{}for~{}~{}m}(\mathrm{N}_{\mathrm{R}})\ll\mathrm{m}( \mathrm{W}_{\mathrm{R}}).\]

Indirectly the most stringent lower limit on the \(\mathrm{W}_{\mathrm{R}}\) mass is obtained from the mass difference between \(\mathrm{K}_{\mathrm{L}}^{0}\) and \(\mathrm{K}_{\mathrm{S}}^{0}\)[5]:

\[\mathrm{m}(\mathrm{W}_{\mathrm{R}})>1.6~{}\mathrm{TeV}.\]

At LHC it will be possible to observe \(\mathrm{W}_{\mathrm{R}}\)'s in a mass range running up to a few TeV. This can be done by looking for event signatures with two isolated electrons and at least two jets. This will yield a very clean data sample which is a priori nearly free from the physics background processes \(\mathrm{Z}+\mathrm{jets}\to\mathrm{e}^{+}\mathrm{e}^{-}+\mathrm{jets}\), \(\mathrm{t}\overline{\mathrm{t}}\to\mathrm{W}^{+}\mathrm{W}^{-}\mathrm{b} \overline{\mathrm{b}}\to\mathrm{e}^{+}\mathrm{e}^{-}\nu_{e}\overline{\nu}_{e} \overline{\nu}_{e}\mathrm{b}\overline{\mathrm{b}}\), and \(\mathrm{W}^{+}\mathrm{W}^{-}+\mathrm{jets}\to\mathrm{e}^{+}\mathrm{e}^{-}\nu_{ e}\overline{\nu}_{e}\overline{\nu}_{e}+\mathrm{jets}\) as will be shown in section 4. Having reconstructed the \(\mathrm{N}_{\mathrm{R}}\)'s its polarisation can be studied as well as its nature. Depending on the theory either Majorana or Dirac neutrinos are produced.

For this study PYTHIA 5.71[6] is used to generate the hard processes. The fragmentation is done using JETSET 7.4[2][6]. The same coupling constants are assumed for left and right-handed particles (\(\mathrm{g_{R}=g_{L}}\)). \(\mathrm{W_{R}}\)'s are supposed to be more massive than the \(\mathrm{N_{R}}\)'s. For the detector simulation ATLFAST 1.2[7] is taken with default values for high luminosity.

Footnote 1: To generate \(\mathrm{W_{R}}\)’s ISUB=142 was selected in PYTHIA. The neutrinos produced in the \(\mathrm{W_{R}}\) decay were substituted by Majorana neutrinos. Hence, \(\mathrm{W_{R}}\)’s decay into \(\mathrm{N_{R}}\) with \(\mathrm{l=e^{\pm},\mu^{\pm},\tau^{\pm}}\) and \(\mathrm{N_{R}=N_{R,e},N_{R,\mu},N_{R,\tau}}\).

## 2 \(\mathrm{W_{R}}\) and \(\mathrm{N_{R}}\) Production at LHC

At LHC possible \(\mathrm{W_{R}}\)'s and \(\mathrm{N_{R}}\)'s can be observed in the TeV range. Right-handed W bosons will be produced via quark-antiquark annihilation (see figure 1). \(\mathrm{W_{R}}\)'s decay either in a quark-antiquark pair which is the dominant decay mode or semileptonically in a right-handed neutrino and the corresponding lepton. \(\mathrm{W_{R}}\)'s can also decay into \(\mathrm{W_{L}Z}\). The branching ratio depends on the mixing angle \(\chi_{\mathrm{W}}\) which is of the order of \((\mathrm{m(W_{L})/m(W_{R})})^{2}\) and hence very small. The branching ratio for \(\mathrm{W_{R}\to W_{L}H}\) is as well negligible. Under the assumption that the coupling constants and the CKM matrices are the same for left and right-handed particles the decay width is given by

\[\Gamma(\mathrm{W_{R}\to f_{a}f_{b}})=\frac{\alpha}{12\cdot\sin^{2}\theta_{ \mathrm{W}}}\cdot\mathrm{N_{C}}\cdot\mathrm{m_{W_{R}}}\cdot(1-\eta_{a})^{2} \cdot(1+\frac{\eta_{a}}{2}),\]

where \(\sqrt{\eta_{a}}=\mathrm{m_{a}/m_{W_{R}}}\) and \(\mathrm{m_{b}\approx 0}\). \(\mathrm{N_{C}=3}\) for quarks and \(\mathrm{N_{C}=1}\) for leptons. For \(\sqrt{\eta_{N}}\ll 1\) and in the case of no mixing between \(\mathrm{N_{R}}\) and \(\nu\) the leptonic decay width is

\[\Gamma(\mathrm{W_{R}\to N_{R}l})\approx\frac{\alpha}{12\cdot\sin^{2}\theta_{ \mathrm{W}}}\cdot\mathrm{m_{W_{R}}}.\]

The decay width as function of the ratio of the \(\mathrm{N_{R}}\) and \(\mathrm{W_{R}}\) mass is shown in figure 2a. Neglecting \(\mathrm{W_{L}Z}\) and \(\mathrm{W_{L}H}\) couplings and the top-quark mass an analytical calculation gives

\[\mathrm{Br}(\mathrm{W_{R}\to N_{R}l})\approx\frac{1}{12}.\]

Taking into account \(\sqrt{\eta_{N}}\) and the top mass will lead to a reduced phase space, hence the branching ratio is less than 1/12. As shown in figure 3a the branching ratio depends strongly on the mass of the right-handed neutrino. In figure 3b the cross section of the decay mode \(\mathrm{W_{R}\to eN_{R,e}}\) is shown for different \(\mathrm{W_{R}}\) masses as function of \(\mathrm{R=m(N_{R})/m(W_{R})}\). The cross sections represent a lower limit. It is assumed that \(\mathrm{m(N_{R,e})=m(N_{R,\mu})=m(N_{R,\tau})}\). For \(\mathrm{m(N_{R,\mu}),m(N_{R,\tau})>m(N_{R,e})}\) the corresponding branching ratios \(\mathrm{W_{R}\to lN_{R,l}}\) with \(\mathrm{l=\mu}\), \(\tau\) is smaller due to a reduced phase space. Subsequently the branching ratio \(\mathrm{W_{R}\to eN_{R,e}}\) is bigger. Assuming an integrated luminosity of the order \(10^{4}-10^{5}\mathrm{pb^{-1}}\) there will be quite some \(\mathrm{W_{R}}\) events produced in the semileptonic \(\mathrm{W_{R}}\) decay.

The heavy neutrino decays via an electron and an off-shell \(\mathrm{W_{R}}\) to \(\mathrm{l_{i}\overline{q}_{i}}\) with \(\mathrm{l=e,\mu}\), \(\tau\) (both charges are possible), \(\mathrm{q_{i}}\) and \(\mathrm{\overline{q}_{i}}\) are each one of the six quark flavours (see figure 1).

In the case of no mixing the off-shell \(\rm W_{R}\) can only decay to a quark-antiquark pair. In the case of Majorana neutrinos the neutrino and its antiparticle are identical. The neutrino can decay into \(\rm l^{+}q_{i}q_{j}\) as well as in \(\rm l^{-}\overline{q}_{i}q_{j}\) which is equally probable

\[\rm Br(N_{R}\to\rm 1^{+}q_{i}\overline{q}_{j})=Br(N_{R}\to\rm 1^{-} \overline{q}_{i}q_{j})=50\%.\]

In the case of a Dirac neutrino \(\rm N_{R}\) can only decay into \(\rm N_{R}\to e^{-}\overline{q}_{i}q_{j}\), the corresponding antiparticle to \(\rm\overline{N}_{R}\to e^{+}q_{i}\overline{q}_{j}\). The decay width for Majorana neutrinos as function of the \(\rm N_{R}\) mass can be found in figure 2b. The decay width for Dirac neutrinos is reduced by a factor of 0.5 due to the smaller amount of possible decay channels. The lifetime of heavy neutrinos is of the order of \(\rm 10^{-15}\) s, hence \(\rm N_{R}\)'s decay at the production vertex and cannot be reconstructed via a secondary vertex in the inner tracking system.

For \(\rm m(N_{R})\leq 0.6\cdot m(W_{R})\) the electron from the decay \(\rm W_{R}\to eN_{R}\) usually has a transverse momentum which is higher than that of the \(\rm N_{R}\) decay. This is shown in figure 4. For \(0.6<\rm m(N_{R})/m(W_{R})<0.8\) the electrons have approximately the same energy and for \(\rm m(N_{R})/m(W_{R})\geq 0.8\) the electron from the \(\rm N_{R}\) decay has a higher transverse momentum than that from the \(\rm W_{R}\) decay.

Another feature which can be studied with the ATLAS detector is the polarisation of the \(\rm W_{R}\) and the \(\rm N_{R}\). \(\rm W_{R}\) is a boson with spin 1 which is longitudinally polarised. At LHC they are produced predominantly in the annihilation of one valence quark from the proton with an antiquark from the sea (see figure 1). One consequence is that about two times more \(\rm W_{R}^{+}\)'s than \(\rm W_{R}^{-}\)'s are produced. On average the valence quark has a higher momentum than the sea quark. Hence, the spin of the \(\rm W_{R}\)'s will align mainly with the direction of the valence quark. Subsequently the \(\rm e^{\pm}\) from the \(\rm W_{R}\) decay will be more likely emitted parallel (antiparallel) with respect to the direction of the \(\rm W_{R}\). The angular distribution of the \(\rm e^{-}(e^{+})\) is a combination of the distributions of the helicity states \(\rm+1\) and \(\rm-1,(1+cos\theta^{*})^{2}\) and \(\rm(1-cos\theta^{*})^{2}\) respectively. In figures 11a-c the angular distributions in the centre of mass system of the \(\rm W_{R}\) are shown. \(\rm N_{R}\)'s are longitudinally polarised with spin 1/2. The \(\rm e^{-}(e^{+})\) from the \(\rm N_{R}\) decay has helicity \(\rm+1(-1)\) and is emitted parallel (antiparallel) with respect to the \(\rm N_{R}\) direction in the centre of mass system of the \(\rm N_{R}\). The angular distributions in the centre of mass system of the \(\rm N_{R}\) can be found in figures 11d-f.

## 3 Detector Simulation

A detailed description of the ATLAS detector can be found in reference [8]. For the analysis presented in this paper a good electron and jet identification is necessary.

In the fast detector simulation program ATLFAST jets and electrons are reconstructed in the following way. First the transverse energies \(\rm E_{T}\) of all particles depositing energy in the calorimeter are summed up in cells of a given granularity of \(0.1\times 0.1\) in \(\eta\times\phi\). In the next step clusters are defined by summing all cells in a cone of radius \(\Delta R=\sqrt{(\Delta\eta)^{2}+(\Delta\phi)^{2}}<0.4\) around the cells with highest \(\rm E_{T}\) in decreasing order. If these clusters are not identified as photon or electron they are classified as jets. They are identified as an electron if they match a generated electron of \(\rm p_{T}>5\) GeV, \(\rm|\eta\)\(|<2.5\) with \(\Delta R<0.1\). For isolation the distance \(\Delta R\) of the electron from any other cluster must be larger than 0.4 and the deposited transverse energy around the electron in a cone of radius \(\Delta R=0.2\) must be less than 10 GeV.

Electrons are reconstructed in the electromagnetic calorimeter with a design energy resolution of

\[\frac{\sigma_{\mathrm{E}}}{\mathrm{E}} = \frac{12\%}{\sqrt{\mathrm{E}}}\oplus\frac{\sigma_{\mathrm{electronic}}}{ \mathrm{E}}\oplus\frac{\sigma_{\mathrm{pile}}\mathrm{\text{-}up}}{\mathrm{E}} \oplus 0.7\%;\] \[\frac{\sigma_{\mathrm{electronic}}}{\mathrm{E}} = \frac{24\,\mathrm{MeV}}{\mathrm{p}_{T}}\mathrm{for}\ |\ \eta\ |\!<1.4,\] \[= \frac{306\mathrm{MeV}\cdot(2.4\!-|\ \eta\ |+\!0.228)}{\mathrm{E}} \mathrm{for}\ |\ \eta\ |\!>1.4;\] \[\frac{\sigma_{\mathrm{pile}}\mathrm{\text{-}up}}{\mathrm{E}} = \frac{320\mathrm{MeV}}{\mathrm{p}_{T}}\ \mathrm{for}\ |\ \eta\ |\!<0.6,\] \[= \frac{295\mathrm{MeV}}{\mathrm{p}_{T}}\ \mathrm{for}\ 0.6\!<\!|\ \eta\ |\!<1.4,\] \[= \frac{270\mathrm{MeV}}{\mathrm{p}_{T}}\ \mathrm{for}\ |\ \eta\ |\!>1.4.\]

The electron charge is measured in the inner tracking system. The charge misidentification rate is a function of the \(1/p_{T}\) distribution which is a Gaussian distribution with a sigma of

\[\sigma\left(\frac{1}{\mathrm{p}_{T}}\right)=10^{-4}\,\oplus\frac{0.01\,2}{ \mathrm{p}_{T}}.\]

The charge of an electron is misidentified if \(1/\mathrm{p}_{T}<0\). This rate as function of the transverse momentum is shown in figure 5. Below \(\mathrm{p}_{T}=500\) GeV there is no misidentification. For \(\mathrm{p}_{T}>500\) GeV the misidentification rate rises slowly and reaches around 16% at \(\mathrm{p}_{T}=2\) TeV.

Hadron jets are identified in the hadronic calorimeter with an energy resolution:

\[\frac{\sigma_{E}}{\mathrm{E}}=\frac{50\%}{\sqrt{\mathrm{E}}} \oplus 3\%\ \ \ \mathrm{for}\ |\ \eta\ |\!<3,\] \[\frac{\sigma_{\mathrm{E}}}{\mathrm{E}}=\frac{100\%}{\sqrt{ \mathrm{E}}}\oplus 7\%\ \ \ \mathrm{for}\ |\ \eta\ |\!>3.\]

The cluster algorithm to calculate the energy underestimates jet energies for jets with \(\mathrm{p}_{T}<100\) GeV. The energies are corrected as function of \(\mathrm{p}_{T}\) for light quark and b-quark jets. The corresponding correction functions are shown in figures 6a and b.

## 4 Event Selection

To reconstruct \(\mathrm{W}_{\mathrm{R}}\) and \(\mathrm{N}_{\mathrm{R}}\) at LHC the decay channel \(\mathrm{W}_{\mathrm{R}}\to\mathrm{e}\mathrm{N}_{\mathrm{R}}\to\mathrm{e} \mathrm{e}\mathrm{q}_{i}\overline{\mathrm{q}}_{i}\) can be used. As shown in section 2 the cross section is high enough to detect these particles in the TeV range already after one year of LHC data taking with low luminosity. Event signatures with two isolated electrons and at least two jets have to be selected. It can be shown that the two jets with highest \(\mathrm{p}_{T}\) mainly arise from the \(\mathrm{N}_{\mathrm{R}}\) decay. How such an event looks like in the ATLAS detector is shown in figure 7. The reconstruction efficiencies for the number of isolated electrons found in \(\mathrm{W}_{\mathrm{R}}\to\mathrm{e}\mathrm{N}_{\mathrm{R}}\to\mathrm{e} \mathrm{e}\mathrm{q}_{i}\overline{\mathrm{q}}_{i}\) events for different \(\mathrm{W}_{\mathrm{R}}\) and \(\mathrm{N}_{\mathrm{R}}\) energies are summarised in table 1. In 40-47% of the events in this decay channel two

For jet reconstruction a minimum \(\rm p_{T}\) of 15 GeV is required.

isolated electrons are found. In 10% of the events no isolated electron is found and in 40-47% of the events one isolated electron is found. Mainly due to initial state radiation but also due to final state radiation and further interactions of the proton remnants usually more than two jets are reconstructed in the calorimeter. The number of reconstructed jets with a \(\mathrm{p_{T}}>15\) GeV can as well be found in table 1.

W\({}_{\mathrm{R}}\)'s and \(\mathrm{N_{R}}\)'s are reconstructed by calculating the invariant mass of the (eejjj) and (ejjj) system respectively, where \(\mathrm{j_{i}}\) and \(\mathrm{j_{j}}\) are the jets with highest \(\mathrm{p_{T}}\). In figure 8a the generated \(\mathrm{W_{R}}\) mass spectrum is shown for \(\mathrm{W_{R}=1~{}TeV}\). Figure 8b shows the same distribution after folding with the ATLAS detector resolution. The spectrum is no longer a Breit-Wigner distribution but a mixture of a Breit-Wigner and a Gaussian distribution. The tail at lower invariant masses is due to badly measured jet energies for jets with a \(\mathrm{p_{T}}\) lower than around 100 GeV although these energies were corrected for. The detector resolution on the \(\mathrm{W_{R}}\) mass is \(\Delta\mathrm{m(W_{R})/m(W_{R})\approx 1.7-2\%}\). The two jets from the \(\mathrm{N_{R}}\) decay are not always those with highest \(\mathrm{p_{T}}\). This will create some background in the invariant mass spectrum (figure 8c). Figure 8e-f shows similar plots for the invariant mass distribution of \(\mathrm{N_{R}}\)'s with a mass of 400 GeV. The spectrum is shown after detector simulation (figure 8d) and after inclusion of picking up wrong jets (figure 8e). In figure 8f the same plot is shown after inclusion of the combinatorial background arising from the combination of the electron from the \(\mathrm{W_{R}}\) decay with the two jets. It is evident that this combinatorical background has little influence for \(\mathrm{m(N_{R})=0.4\cdot m(W_{R})}\). However, for \(0.6<\mathrm{m(N_{R})/m(W_{R})<0.8}\) it will rise because the electron from the \(\mathrm{W_{R}}\) decay has a similar energy spectrum than the one from the \(\mathrm{N_{R}}\) decay.

The detector resolution on the reconstruction of the \(\mathrm{N_{R}}\) mass is \(\frac{\Delta\mathrm{m(N_{R})}}{\mathrm{m(N_{R})}}\approx\frac{6.4\%}{\sqrt{m( N_{R})}}\oplus 1.8\%\) (see figure 9). The efficiencies to reconstruct the decay chain \(\mathrm{W_{R}\to eN_{R}\to eeq_{i}\overline{q}}\) for a \(\mathrm{W_{R}}\) mass of 2 TeV are shown in figure 10. For \(\mathrm{m(N_{R})<0.2\cdot m(W_{R})}\) and \(\mathrm{m(N_{R})>0.9\cdot m(W_{R})}\) the reconstruction efficiency is reduced because less electrons from the \(\mathrm{N_{R}}\) or \(\mathrm{W_{R}}\) decay respectively pass the electron isolation criteria.

The main background sources for the reconstruction of \(\mathrm{W_{R}}\)'s and \(\mathrm{N_{R}}\)'s are the physics processes \(\mathrm{Z+jets\to e^{+}e^{-}+jets}\) and \(\mathrm{t\overline{t}\to W^{+}W^{-}b\overline{b}\to e^{+}e^{-}\nu_{e}\overline {\nu}_{e}b\overline{b}}\). In addition some more contamination is arising from the process \(\mathrm{W^{+}W^{-}+jets\to e^{+}e^{-}\nu_{e}\overline{\nu}_{e}+jet\,s}\).

The cross section for the process \(\mathrm{t\overline{t}\to W^{+}W^{-}b\overline{b}\to e^{+}e^{-}\nu_{e}\overline {\nu}_{e}b\overline{b}}\) is \(\sigma=6.9\) pb. Approximately 80% pass the trigger conditions and in 50% of the cases two isolated electrons and at least two jets are reconstructed. These events are characterised by two b-jets found in the event and a large missing \(\mathrm{p_{T}}\) due to the undetected neutrinos. The invariant mass of the (eejjj) and (ejjj) system peak around 300 GeV and 200 GeV respectively. (see figure 12a, b). These events are successfully suppressed by requiring:

* the invariant mass of the (eejjj) system lies within \(\pm 3\sigma\) of the expected \(\mathrm{W_{R}}\) mass. As shown in figure 8b the mass spectrum of the \(\mathrm{W_{R}}\) can be described by a Gaussian distribution in the peak region;
* the missing transverse momentum \(\mathrm{p_{T,miss}}\) is lower than 100 GeV;
* the transverse momentum of the highest energetic isolated electron \(\mathrm{p_{T}(e_{max})}\) is bigger than 200 GeV.

The corresponding distributions are shown in figure 12b-d. For comparison the same distributions are shown in figure 13b-d for \(\mathrm{W_{R}\to N_{R}e\to eejj}\) for a \(\mathrm{W_{R}}\) mass of 1 TeV and a \(N_{R}\) mass of 400 GeV. In the case of even higher energetic \(W_{R}\)'s the distributions for \(p_{T}(e_{max})\) will peak at even higher values. With these cuts applied to the subsample of events passing the trigger conditions and with two isolated electrons and at least two jets more than 99.8% of the events are rejected for \(m(W_{R})\leq 4.5~{}TeV\). For even more massive \(W_{R}\)'s the background is zero. The cross section for \(W^{+}W^{-}+jets\to e^{+}e^{-}\nu_{e}\overline{\nu}_{e}+jets\) is 0.4 pb\({}^{-1}\). The electrons are not well separated and in only 4.4% of these events two isolated electrons are found. Hence, this source of background is much lower than from \(t\overline{t}\to W^{+}W^{-}b\overline{b}\to e^{+}e^{-}\nu_{e}\overline{\nu}_{ e}b\overline{b}\) events but the signatures are similar. The peak in the invariant mass spectrum of the (eej,j) system and the \(p_{T}\) distribution of the higher energetic electron is peaking at even lower values. Applying the same cuts mentioned above for \(t\overline{t}\to W^{+}W^{-}b\overline{b}\to e^{+}e^{-}\nu_{e}\overline{\nu}_{ e}b\overline{b}\) events the remaining background from \(W^{+}W^{-}+jets\to e^{+}e^{-}\nu_{e}\overline{\nu}_{e}+jets\) events can be neglected.

The cross section for \(Z+jets\to e^{+}e^{-}+jets\) is \(\sigma=4.766~{}nb^{3}\), hence, around \(10^{3}-10^{5}\) times superior to \(W_{R}\to eeq\overline{q}\). 50% of these event s pass the trigger. The electrons usually are not classified as isolated electrons and in only 5.6% of the events two isolated electrons and at least two jets are found. In total, only 2.8% of the \(Z+jets\to e^{+}e^{-}+jets\) decays contribute to the background. The invariant mass spectrum of the (eej,j) and (ej,j) system are shown in figure 14a and b. It peaks at around 200 and 150 GeV respectively and is potentially a severe background for \(N_{R}\) lower than 500 GeV. These events are characterised by a peak in the invariant mass spectrum of the two electrons at the \(Z\) mass and a low \(p_{T}(e_{max})\). (see figures 14b-d). The events are suppressed by requiring:

* the invariant mass of the two isolated electrons is inconsistent with the \(Z^{0}\) mass (80 GeV \(<M_{inv}(ee)<150\) GeV);
* \(p_{T}(e_{max})\) is bigger than 200 GeV;
* the invariant mass of the (eej,j) system lies within \(\pm 3\sigma\) of the expected \(W_{R}\) mass.

Less than \(3\cdot 10^{-3}\)% of the events which pass the trigger and in which two isolated electrons and at least two jets are found survive the cuts. For \(m(W_{R})\geq 4\) TeV no event survives.

## 5 Reconstruction of \(W_{R}\) and \(N_{R}\)

As shown in section 4 \(W_{R}\)'s and \(N_{R}\)'s can be reconstructed by selecting events with two isolated electrons and at least two jets. To suppress the background from other physics processes the cuts discussed in section 4 can be used. The physics background arising from \(Z+jets\to e^{+}e^{-}+jets\), \(t\overline{t}\to W^{+}W^{-}b\overline{b}\to e^{+}e^{-}\nu_{e}\overline{\nu}_{ e}b\overline{b}\), and \(W^{+}W^{-}+jets\to e^{+}e^{-}\nu_{e}\overline{\nu}_{e}+jets\) events only produces unlike-sign electron pairs. For Majorana neutrinos in 50% of the cases like-sign electron pairs are produced, hence in this case the background is totally suppressed. Nevertheless, in the following the cuts to suppress the physics background are also applied for events in which like-sign electron pairs are produced. Therefore, the same analysis is valid for Majorana as well as for Dirac neutrinos.

To reconstruct \(W_{R}\)'s and \(N_{R}\)'s the following method is used. First the invariant mass of the (eej,j) system is calculated. This spectrum is fitted by a superposition of a Gaussian and a Breit Wigner distribution. To reconstruct \(N_{R}\)'s the \(W_{R}\) mass is used as a constraint by requiring that the reconstructed \(W_{R}\) mass lies within \(\pm 3\sigma\). This constraint does not only reduce the background from other physics processes but also the background from events in which the jets with highest \(p_{T}\) do not come from the \(N_{R}\) decay. In addition events in which the jet energies or directions are badly reconstructed are not taken into account. The invariant mass spectrum of the \(N_{R}\) includes both combinations of the jets with the electrons. The background due to the combination of the jets with the electron from the \(W_{R}\) decay might be reduced by selecting the combination with the higher or lower \(p_{T}\) electron depending on the ratio of the \(N_{R}\) and \(W_{R}\) masses. To reconstruct \(N_{R}\)'s the spectrum is fitted by a superposition of a Breit-Wigner and a Gaussian distribution for \(m(W_{R})\leq 1\) TeV and by a superposition of a Gaussian and a linear distribution in the peak region for \(m(W_{R})>1\) TeV. In figure 15 the \(W_{R}\) and \(N_{R}\) mass spectrum is shown for \(m(W_{R})=1,2,3\) TeV and \(m(N_{R})/m(W_{R})=0.4\). The numbers of event s correspond to one year of data taking with low luminosity, one year of high luminosity, and three years of high luminosity respectively to account for the different cross sections. In table 2 the number of reconstructed \(W_{R}\to eN_{R}\to e{\rm eq}\,\overline{q}\,\) for different \(W_{R}\) masses and luminosities are given, as well as the reconstruction efficiencies and fitted \(W_{R}\) and \(N_{R}\) masses. For a discovery the signal must exceed a \(5\,\sigma\) fluctuation of the physics background. The mass limits for a discovery after one year of data taking with low luminosity (\(L=10^{4}pb^{-1}\)) and 3 years of data taking with high luminosity (\(L=3\cdot 10^{5}pb^{-1}\)) are shown in figure 16. Already after one year of low luminosity \(W_{R}\)'s can be discovered up to approximately 3.5 TeV for \(m(N_{R})\raisebox{-3.698858pt}{~{}\shortstack{$<$ \\ [-0.07cm] $\sim$}}~{}2.2\) TeV. After 3 years of data taking with high luminosity \(W_{R}\)'s can be found up to \(m(W_{R})=4.5-5.5\) TeV depending on the \(N_{R}\) mass.

In case right-handed particles do not exist or are even more heavy than reported here they can be excluded up to a certain \(W_{R}\) and \(N_{R}\) mass. The exclusion plot at a 95% confidence level is shown in figure 17. After one year of low luminosity \(W_{R}\)'s can be ruled out if the \(W_{R}\) mass is below 4 TeV and 400 GeV. After 3 years of data taking with high luminosity \(W_{R}\)'s can be excluded up to nearly 6 TeV. As shown after one year of data taking with low luminosity \(W_{R}\)'s can either be discovered or excluded up to \(W_{R}\) masses of around 3.5 TeV or 4 TeV respectively. Because of the clear event signature and the low physics background level this will be part of the physics program which will be feasible at the beginning of LHC running.

Due to the low background in the \(N_{R}\) mass spectrum polarisation effects of the \(N_{R}\) can be studied. For this purpose only events are taken into account which lie within \(\pm 2\sigma\) around the \(N_{R}\) mass. As discussed in section 2 \(N_{R}\)'s are longitudinally polarised. In figure 18 the \(\cos\theta\) distributions of the electrons and positrons in the centre of mass system of the \(N_{R}\) are shown for \(W_{R}=1,2,3\) TeV and \(m(N_{R})/m(W_{R})=0.4\). The polarisation effect is well visible. The distributions for \(e^{-}(e^{+})\)'s show clearly the expected \((1\pm\cos\theta^{*})^{2}\) distribution.

Furthermore, the nature of the \(N_{R}\)'s can be studied to find out if the heavy neutrino is a Majorana or a Dirac neutrino. In figure 19 the ratio of like-sign and unlike-sign electron pairs is plotted. For Majorana neutrinos the expected ratio is one. The measured ratio lies below one. This is due to background events arising from \(t\overline{t}\to W^{+}W^{-}b\overline{b}\to e^{+}e^{-}\nu_{e}\overline{\nu}_{ e}b\overline{b}\) and \(Z+jets\to e^{+}e^{-}+jets\). In these events only unlike-sign lepton pairs are produced. If the \(N_{R}\) mass is high with respect to the \(W_{R}\) mass the signal to background ratio is getting worse. Thus, the deviation from one is bigger. For \(m(W_{R})=3\) TeV and

\(\rm m(N_{R})>0.6\cdot m(W_{R})\) the ratio decreases due to charge misidentification. In the case of Dirac neutrinos no like-sign pairs are expected. Nonetheless, a small amount of like-sign pairs are observed arising from charge misidentification of high energetic electrons. For both types of neutrinos the deviation from the expected ratio of like-sign to unlike-sign pairs is so small that it will be possible to rule out one of these types.

## 6 Summary

In this note the discovery potential of right-handed \(W_{R}\)'s and heavy \(N_{R}\)'s at ATLAS is explored. These particles can be reconstructed in the decay chain \(W_{R}\to eN_{R}\to eeq_{i}\overline{q}\). Events with two isolated electrons and at least two jets are selected. Calculating the invariant mass of the \((eejj_{i})\) and \((ejj_{j})\) system \(W_{R}\)'s and \(N_{R}\)'s are reconstructed. The background from the physics processes \(\rm t\overline{t}\to W^{+}W^{-}b\overline{b}\to e^{+}e^{-}\nu_{e}\overline{\nu} _{e}b\overline{b}\), \(W^{+}W^{-}+jets\to e^{+}e^{-}\nu_{e}\overline{\nu}_{e}+jets\), and \(Z+jets\to e^{+}e^{-}+jets\) can be suppressed efficiently. The cross section of the semileptonic decay of the \(W_{R}\) is high enough to discover \(W_{R}\)'s up to 3.5 TeV or exclude them for \(\rm m(W_{R})<4\) TeV already after one year of data taking with low luminosity. If the \(N_{R}\) mass is high with respect to the \(W_{R}\) mass these limits are lower. After 3 years of LHC running with high luminosity \(W_{R}\)'s can be found (excluded) up to \(4.5-5.5\) TeV (6 TeV). The low background in the \(N_{R}\) mass spectrum permits to study \(N_{R}\) polarisation. \(N_{R}\)'s are longitudinally polarised. The charge misidentification is so low that the type of heavy neutrino can be examined. Looking at the charge of the electron pair Majorana or Dirac neutrinos can be ruled out.
