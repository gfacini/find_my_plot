### The experimental setup

The principle of the method consists of measuring the temperature gradient across the glue layer if one side of the sample is heated, the opposite side is cooled and the value of the thermal flow is known. The measurements were done using a setup with a configuration very close to the one used by us for measuring the value of the coefficient of the transverse thermal conductivity of TPG ref.[3].

The test sample is clamped between two copper blocks. One of them is equipped with a heater, the other is cooled by an external cooler. Every block is equipped with 4 thermal sensors (Pt100).The schematic drawing of the setup is shown in Fig.1, its "equivalent" electrical analog shown in Fig.2. All our measurements are done inside a vacuum vessel at temperature near \(0^{0}C\) at residual pressure near \(10^{-2}m\,bar\). We measured the samples of AlN bars glued one to the other as cross connections as shown in Fig.3. The thickness of the glue layer was controlled and adjusted by using the special shims to three values : \(50\mu m\), \(100\mu m\) and \(200\mu m\) for both types of glue. The width of the AlN bars was \(8mm\) and the thickness \(500\mu m\). The glues layer had a cross section of \(8mm\times 8mm=64mm^{2}\). Three samples for each type of glue were tested.

### Measurement of \(C_{kt}\)- coefficient of thermal conductivity.

The value of the thermal resistance \(R_{t}\) of the sample can be easy determinated as slope of a linear fit to the measured dependence of \(\Delta T\) on \(P\), where \(\Delta T\)**--**the temperature gradient between cooling and heating blocks and \(P\)**--**the thermal power conducted through the test sample from heating block to the cooling sink. In our measurements we take \(\Delta T\) as difference of the mean temperature of the heating and cooling blocks (both values are averaged from four read-out sensors).

The value of \(R_{t}\) includes the \(R_{inner}\)**--**thermal resistance of the setup (quality of thermal contact of the sensors to blocks, thermal resistance along the thermal runway through copper blocks from the sample surface to the sensors, etc.) and \(R_{AlN}\)**--**the transverse thermal resistance of two AlN bars. The value of \(R_{inner}\) can be measured by "shorting" the setup (independent measurement without the sample, when the heating block is pressed to the cooling block). The coefficient of the thermal conductivity of AlN bars is known from independent measurements (\(185\frac{W}{m\times K}\) ).

The result of the measurement of thermal resistance is shown in Fig.4. The dependence of the resistance of the samples as function of the thickness of the glue layer is plotted in Fig.5. According to our measurements the value of the coefficient of thermal conductivity is :

ELASTOSIL 137-184: \(C_{kt}=1.79\pm 0.1\frac{W}{m\times K}\)

ARALDITE 2011: \(C_{kt}=0.87\pm 0.06\frac{W}{m\times K}\)

The measured value of \(C_{kt}\) of ELASTOSIL 137-182 just fits to region specified by the manufacturer. The value of \(C_{kt}\) of Boron nitride loaded ARALDITE 2011 is in good agreement with independent measurement performed by another group in ref.[4].

### Thermal properties

The comparison of the thermal conductivity of ARALDITE RAPID and ELASTOSIL 137-182 was done using a different setup, different configuration of the samples and completely different read-out system. The measurements were done inside of vacuum vessel at residual pressure about \(10^{-1}mbar\) and at the mean temperature \(\sim 10^{o}C\). Six samples with three thicknesses of the glue layers for each type of the glue were tested. The scheme of the measurement and the test sample are shown in Fig.6 and Fig.7 respectively. The sample consist of two Al bars connected by a TPG bar through two layers of glue. All samples were made with the same dimensions of Al and TPG bars and the same area of glue connection. The thermal runway along the test sample consists of double the thickness of a glue layer, double the thickness of the \(\mbox{\sc Al}\mbox{\,--\,bar}\) (\(2\times 0.5mm\)) and the TPG--jumper (\(\sim 30mm\times 10mm\times 0.5mm\) ). In this tests the thermal resistances of Al and TPG--bars are neglectibly small in com

parison with the resistance of the double glue layers. The thermal resistance of the samples as function of the glue layer thickness is plotted in Fig.8. This value is not corrected for \(R_{inner}\), \(R_{Al}\) and \(R_{TPG}\). The ratio of the slope parameters of linear fits to this dependence shows the ratio of the thermal resistance of the samples. It is easy to see, that the difference of the thermal conductivity can be estimated as more than a factor of four.

### Mechanical property

A series of strength at tension tests for ELASTOSIL glue was performed. The scheme of the measurement and the structure of the test samples is shown in Fig.6. Some samples were irradiated in a proton beam (\(p=100MeV/c\)).

\begin{tabular}{c|c c c c c} \hline \(N\)\(of\)\(sample\) & \(1_{1}\) & \(3_{1}\) & \(5_{1}\) & \(6\) & \(2\) & \(4\) \\ \hline \(\mbox{Fluence}\,[\frac{proton}{cm^{2}}]\) & \(1.3\times 10^{12}\) & \(4.1\times 10^{12}\) & \(1.3\times 10^{14}\) & \(2.6\times 10^{14}\) & \(8.5\times 10^{14}\) & \(2.7\times 10^{15}\) \\ \hline \end{tabular}

The first series of the measurements started one day later after gluing of the samples. Six samples were tested. Every of them broke at the ARALDITE layer. We refugled the ARALDITE connection, pressed the AlN-- bars to Al--bars by using additional external clamps and repeated the test two days later. Two samples out of three broke by AlN-- ceramic destruction, one of them was disrupted at the ELASTOSIL layer. The other samples were tested after irradiation two weeks later. All irradiated samples disrupted by ceramic destruction. We repeated our measurements using three samples with one Al--bar glued to another Al--bar directly (samples number 10,11 and 12). We tested these samples 1, 5 and 9 days after gluing. The results of the strength at tension tests are summarized in Table.2. The tensile strength detachment as function of time after gluing is plotted in Fig.9. The point corresponding to two weeks time exposition is the value averaged from three samples.
