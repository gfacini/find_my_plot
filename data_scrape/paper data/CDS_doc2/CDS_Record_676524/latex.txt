## 3 TeV\({}^{-1}\)-sized Extra Dimensions

In this case, the ED are small enough to allow the propagation of gauge bosons in the bulk without contradicting the existing electroweak measurements. Only models with one small ED are considered here, with the fermions localized in the brane at different locations (M1 and M2 models). The main feature of this model is the production of KK excitations of the \(Z\) and \(W\) bosons. Their mass spectrum is defined by: \(m_{Z^{(k)},W^{(k)}}^{2}=m_{Z,W}^{2}+k^{2}M_{C}^{2}\) where \(M_{C}\) is the compactification scale, known to be \(\geq 4\) TeV from precision electroweak data. Hence only the first excitations \(Z^{(1)}\) and \(W^{(1)}\) can be seen at LHC. In the electron channel [6] the experimental resolution is smaller than the natural width of the \(Z^{(1)}\). The expected signal 1 is shown on Fig. 2, left plot. The direct observation of a peak is possible if \(M_{C}\leq 5.8\) TeV. However, this reach can be improved drastically by using all the information with a maximum likelihood, in particular using the region before the peak (Fig. 2, left) with either constructive or destructive interferences between the \(Z^{(1)}/\gamma^{(1)}\) and \(Z/\gamma\). The sensitivity is thus increased to \(M_{C}^{max}=9.5\) TeV and could even reach 13.5 TeV by combining the electron and muon channels for 300 fb\({}^{-1}\).

Footnote 1: NB: this plot is at parton level. The simulation study gives similar results.

Furthermore, the spin-1 \(Z^{(1)}\) signal can be distinguished from a spin-2 narrow graviton resonance (section 4) using the angular distribution of its decay products. Thanks to the contributions of the higher lying states, the interference terms and to the additional \(\sqrt{2}\) factor in its coupling to SM fermions, the \(Z^{(1)}\) can also be distinguished from a \(Z^{\prime}\) with SM-like couplings: the distribution of the forward-backward asymmetry for the various cases are shown on Fig. 2 for 4 TeV resonances. The \(Z^{(1)}\) hypothesis can be discriminated for masses up to about 5 TeV with an integrated luminosity of 300 fb\({}^{-1}\).

## 4 Warped Extra Dimensions

We consider here one of the Randall-Sundrum models of warped ED, where gravity propagates in a 5D bulk limited by two branes. The SM fields are confined in the first brane. The metric includes an exponential warp factor which curves the space and connects the \(M_{EW}\) scale in the SM brane to the Planck scale in the other brane, hence reformulating the hierarchy problem. The phenomenology is defined by two parameters: the scale of physical processes in the SM brane, \(\Lambda_{\pi}\sim 1\) TeV, and the curvature scale \(c=k/M_{Pl}\). The main feature of this model is the production of KK graviton narrow resonances, whose masses are given by \(m_{n}=x_{n}\Lambda_{\pi}c\) where \(x_{n}\) are the roots of the \(J_{1}\) Bessel function. Here again only the first excitation is likely to be seen at LHC, the other modes being suppressed by the falling parton distribution functions. Some of the best channels are \(G^{(1)}\to e^{+}e^{-}\) and \(G^{(1)}\to\gamma\gamma\), thanks to the energy and angular resolutions of the LHC detectors. The signal expected with 100 fb\({}^{-1}\) in the channel \(e^{+}e^{-}\) is shown on Fig. 3, left plot, for a pessimistic hypothesis of \(c=0.01\). In this case, masses up to 2 TeV can be probed [7]. The reach goes up to about 4 TeV for \(c=0.1\). The sensitivity is summarized on Fig. 4 in the \((m_{G^{(1)}},c)\) plane [8]: if no signal is found, the area left to the curves labeled "Discovery" can be excluded at 95% CL. The interesting region in this plane is limited by the constraint \(\Lambda_{\pi}\leq 10\) TeV (otherwise the model would no longer be interesting for solving the hierarchy problem) and by the \(c<0.1\) limit (low-energy consistency). After one year of data-taking the LHC covers completely this region.

The spin-2 nature of \(G^{(1)}\) can be measured as well as shown on Fig. 3, right plot. It is worth noting that the acceptance at large pseudo-rapidities (\(1.5<|\eta|<2.5\)) is essential for the spin discrimination. The curves labelled "Spin-2" on Fig. 4 show that for graviton masses up to 2.3 TeV (\(c=0.1\)), there is a 90% chance that the spin-2 nature of the graviton can be determined with a 95% CL. It has also been shown [7] that this resonance can be seen

Right plot [7]: angular distribution of \(e^{+}e^{-}\) pairs for the graviton narrow resonance (open circles, yellow curve for the \(gg\) dominant production and red curve for the \(q\bar{q}\) production), for the SM (bottom blue curve) and the expected distribution for a spin 1 resonance (green line).

Right plot [6]: forward-backward asymmetries in the electron channel for different types of resonances, centered at \(m=4\) TeV: two models for the \(Z^{(1)}\) in \(TeV^{-1}\) ED models (top), a \(Z^{\prime}\) (bottom left) and the graviton excitation in RS scenario.

in many other channels (\(\mu\mu\),\(\gamma\gamma\),\(jj\),\(b\bar{b}\), \(\bar{t}\),\(WW\),\(ZZ\)), hence allowing to check the universality of its couplings; and that the size \(R\) of the ED could also be estimated with a 10% accuracy from the mass and cross-section measurements.

Another intriguing signature of this model is the existence of a new massive scalar, the radion, allowing to stabilize the spacing between the two branes at the distance required for solving the hierarchy problem (\(kR\sim 12\)). The radion is very similar to the SM Higgs, and can actually mix with it. Its width is smaller though, as shown on Fig. 5, left plot; and its partial widths can be different, with in particular an enhanced coupling to gluons. There are three additional parameters for the radion: its mass, the vacuum expectation value \(\Lambda_{\phi}\) and the radion-Higgs mixing parameter \(\xi\). The results for the SM Higgs have been reinterpreted for the radion case by folding in the new branching ratios and the appropriate detector resolutions [9]. Fig. 5 (right plot) shows the expected significances for a radion signal in the \(\gamma\gamma\) and \(ZZ^{(*)}\) channels. Discovery is possible over the whole mass range if \(\Lambda_{\phi}\sim\) TeV. If its mass permits, the radion can also decay into a pair of Higgs scalars. If \(m_{\phi}=300\) GeV, only 2(4) fb\({}^{-1}\) are needed for a \(5\sigma\) discovery in the very clean channel \(\phi\to hh\to\gamma\gamma b\bar{b}\) for \(\xi=0(1/6)\). With 30 fb\({}^{-1}\) collected at low luminosity (to maintain excellent \(b\)-tagging), scales up to \(\Lambda_{\phi}=2.2\) TeV can be probed in this channel, and up to 1.0 TeV in the \(\phi\to hh\to b\bar{b}\tau^{+}\tau^{-}\) for \(m_{\phi}=600\) GeV. Discrimination between the radion and a Higgs scalar will require very precise measurements of their couplings.

## 5 Other models and signatures

The existence of ED could also be probed with the dijet cross-section [10] or via the polarization of \(\tau\) leptons in some models with two Higgs doublets and a singlet neutrino in the bulk [11]. Finally, the production of black holes at LHC is another striking signature of ED [12].

## 6 Conclusion

The LHC will be able to probe the relevant region of the parameter space for most of the models with ED studied so far. Moreover, in most cases it will be possible to discriminate such signals from other new physics scenarios and infer some information about the underlying model.
