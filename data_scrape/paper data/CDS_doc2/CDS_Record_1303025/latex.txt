# First tuning of Herwig/Jimmy to ATLAS data

The ATLAS Collaboration

###### Abstract

This note describes the first systematic tuning of the Herwig generator to ATLAS data, with the Jimmy model for multiple parton interactions. We present a new set of Herwig/Jimmy tunes for the MRST LO\(*\), CTEQ6L1 and CTEQ6.6 PDFs, collectively titled "AUET1" ("ATLAS Underlying Event Tune 1"). The MC09 Herwig/Jimmy tuning was taken as a starting point for the AUET1 tunes, but important methodological modifications have been made, in particular use of more tuning parameters. In the tuning of the regularisation scale for multiple scattering, an energy-dependence ansatz similar to the one found in the Pythia 6 generator has been used. While CDF strongly biased towards ATLAS underlying event data, particularly at 7 TeV.

Introduction

MC event generators are a crucial tool for experimental particle physics, providing not just flexible and highly-differential implementations of physics models against which we can test our results, but also a source of simulated events for analysis design and detector-effect unfolding. While the first of these three issues is largely a matter for the theorists, a good match between simulation and data is necessary for the other two. Event generators are at their least predictive when dealing with soft, non-perturbative QCD effects, where their modelling is guided by asymptotic behaviours and extrapolation to more typical conditions introduces parameters whose values can be determined only by comparison to data. This process of parameter optimisation is known as "tuning". Different event generators favour different philosophies of what may be tuned, but the most obvious and uncontroversial areas are the soft QCD processes of hadronisation and beam-particle remnant/bulk effects, the latter typically modelled with some variant of multiple parton interactions (MPI). Of these, hadronisation is most cleanly tuned to event shape and identified particle data from \(e^{+}e^{-}\) colliders, while MPI is a hadron collider effect whose effects are most obviously seen in minimum bias (MB) and underlying event (UE) observables1. In this note, as in previous ATLAS tuning studies, we focus on the tuning of MPI parameters.

Footnote 1: The distinction is that MB is dominated by purely soft QCD scattering with minimal event selection criteria, whereas UE is the soft QCD component which forms an irreducible background in events with an identified hard scattering, e.g. a dijet or Drell-Yan event selection.

The MC09 tune [1] of the Pythia 6 generator [2], based on Tevatron MB and UE data available before the start of LHC data running, provides an excellent description of those data, but was seen to significantly underestimate levels of MPI activity in ATLAS MB and UE data. The ATLAS AMBT1 tune [3] was created as a response to this deficiency, producing a much-improved description of ATLAS data for use in the MC10 simulation production. An exactly analogous situation exists for the MC09 tunes of the Fortran Herwig generator [4] and its Jimmy add-on [5, 6], which provides an MPI model similar to that in Pythia 6 but is unable to describe minimum bias physics. Constructing updated Herwig/Jimmy tunes which can describe the first ATLAS underlying event data, also for use in the MC10 production, is the subject of this note.

Since the MC09 tuning of Herwig/Jimmy, ATLAS MC tuning has almost ubiquitously made use of statistical tools to optimise the MC fit to the reference data. By comparison, in the MC09 tuning round this approach was only taken for the CTEQ6.6 PDF [7] tune of Herwig/Jimmy and the MC09c Pythia 6 tune. The MC09 Herwig/Jimmy tuning also retained the MC08 ansatz for MPI energy extrapolation and did not vary any non-MPI parameters, i.e. the initial state parton shower, intrinsic \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\), etc. were left at default values. The tuning described here improves on the MC08 and MC09 methodologies by including all these aspects in the tuning process, as well as the ATLAS UE data. This new set of tunes is titled "AUET1", in analogy with the ATLAS Pythia 6 AMBT1 tune, and consists of equivalent tunes for the MRST LO\(*\) MC-modified leading order PDF [8], the leading order (LO) CTEQ6L1 PDF [9], and the next-to-leading order (NLO) CTEQ6.6 PDF [7].

## 2 Tuning setup

For this, as in other ATLAS MC tuning studies, we do not use the ATLAS interface to the generator: it is adequate and easier to scan the tuning parameter space with the standalone generator, in this case via the AGILe generator interface [10]. The Rivet system [11] was used to analyse the generated events, and the Professor system was applied to produce the tuned parameters by a combination of response parameterisation and numerical fit optimisation [12].

The generator setup is in most aspects the same as for MC09: we describe only the differences. One difference in the underlying generator model for this collection of tunes is found in the setup of the space-like initial-state shower. As opposed to previous ATLAS use of Herwig, we decided to use a more sophisticated modelling of the ISR shower in the Herwig model by setting \(\tt ISPAC=2\), as this is recommended by the authors. This setting allows for emissions below the ISR shower IR cut-off parameter, \(\tt QSPAC\), giving a smoother matching to the PDF. By comparison, the MC08 and MC09 setups used the default \(\tt ISPAC=0\) setting, which applies a sharp IR cutoff in the space-like shower. We attempted to include \(\tt QSPAC\) itself in a first round of tunes, but with variations between 0.5 and 5 GeV did not find any of the available CDF or ATLAS observables to be sensitive to its value. We hence kept \(\tt QSPAC\) at its MC09/default value of 2.5 GeV.

We note that ATLAS has yet to tune generator final state showers, including that of Herwig, to best describe event shapes from LEP and other \(\e^{+}\e^{-}\) colliders. This deficiency is not resolved for Herwig by this note: it will be addressed along with the other generators when a more complete shower tuning round is completed, including ATLAS jet data.

Since the Jimmy MPI model is by design not valid for multiple scattering where the signal process is itself a soft scatter, minimum bias data cannot be used for tuning of this generator. As the underlying event data from ATLAS and CDF represent a smooth transition from minimum bias to UE-type processes, the softest parts of these observables must also be excluded from fits. In the ATLAS UE data, and that from the CDF 2001 UE study, there is not a _very_ strong distinction between primary and secondary scatters, and so Jimmy is instructed to generate the softest possible scatters by setting its UE mode to 0, via the \(\tt JMUED=0\) parameter setting (see ref. [6]).

### Tuning parameters

The cut-off for multiple parton interactions modelled with Jimmy is a single parameter, \(\tt PTJIM\), without any dependence on the hadronic centre-of-mass energy, \(\sqrt{s}\). In order to make the model fit to data for various collider energies we apply the following energy dependence of \(\tt PTJIM\) which is inspired by the "pomeron-inspired" energy evolution of the similar cut-off in the \(\tt Pythia6\) model:

\[\tt PTJIM(\sqrt{s})=\tt PTJIM_{0}\cdot\left(\frac{\sqrt{s}}{1800\ \mathrm{GeV}} \right)^{EXP}, \tag{1}\]

where the tuning parameter \(\tt PTJIM_{0}\) is the value for \(\tt PTJIM\) (\(\sqrt{s}\)) at the reference energy 1800 GeV and the \(\tt EXP\) parameter controls the rate of energy evolution. The \(\tt EXP\) parameter was manually set at 0.274 in the MC08 Jimmy tune, and was kept fixed at this value in the MC09 Jimmy tunes (for all PDFs). The final MPI parameter for tuning is the hadronic form factor radius: although Jimmy allows to set the proton and antiproton radius separately (\(\tt JMRAD(73)\), \(\tt JMRAD(93)\)), we use the same variable, \(\tt PRRAD\), for both.

It was noticed during the initial exploratory tunes that since the MC08 and MC09 tunes only varied MPI parameters, Herwig was being run without any intrinsic \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) smearing. This parameter typically adds an extra 1 or 2 GeV to \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) measurements and is important for the description of the low-\(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) part of e.g. the \(Z\) boson \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) spectrum: the intrinsic \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) Gaussian smearing is needed to move an anomalous peak at zero into the peak of the distribution, and in determining the line-shape and peak position. The default setting of the intrinsic \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) Gaussian width variable, \(\tt PTRMS=0\), is strongly disfavoured. Since, of our tuning observables, only the CDF\(Z\)\(p_{\rm T}\) measurement gives a strong and unambiguous handle on value of \({\tt PTRMS}\), we decided to manually tune this as an isolated single variable with a single observable, rather than add an extra parameter to the multi-dimensional part of the tuning. Comparing the \(Z\)\(p_{\rm T}\) line-shapes [13] with \({\tt PTRMS}\) values between 0.5 and 2.0, as seen in Figure 1, we chose a value of \({\tt PTRMS}=1.2\) (GeV) as giving the best results and used this as a basis for the rest of the tuning. This choice was virtually insensitive to the choice of PDF.

After fixing \({\tt QSPAC}\) to its default value, and after tuning \({\tt PTRMS}\) manually, the remaining step was a three-dimensional tuning of \({\tt PJIM}_{0}\), \({\tt EXP}\), and \({\tt PRRAD}\) using the Professor tool according to the procedure described in the AMBT1 [3] and Professor [12] papers. The relevant fixed settings and sampling ranges for these parameters, and those for the MC09 tune, are shown in Table 1. The ranges were determined as suitable for all three PDFs by means of observable envelope plots, which showed complete coverage of the observables valid for the Jimmy model by the sampled parameter points.

## 3 Tuning and results

Several iterations of the tuning observable weights were explored before converging on a balance well-matched to current ATLAS use. As the Jimmy MPI model is fundamentally not able to describe minimum bias data, MB observables were entirely excluded from the fit. Of the remaining UE data, weightings were applied to the observables as described in ref. [12]. The weights were chosen to strongly bias the fit towards the ATLAS 7 TeV data (since that is the relevant data to which the MC10 samples will be compared), then to the ATLAS 900 GeV data, and finally to CDF UE data. The purpose of the CDF data is to protect the tune against over-fitting to the ATLAS track-based UE measurements. The observables used are a subset of those used in the Pythia AMBT1 tune, and are described in detail in ref. [3] - while the Pythia tune could use both MB and

Figure 1: (a) CDF \(Z\)\(p_{\rm T}\) peak with different Herwig intrinsic \(p_{\rm T}\)s from 0 to 1.5 GeV. The problem with the \({\tt PTRMS}=0\) setting of previous tunes may be seen from the behaviour of that curve in the first (zero-\(p_{\rm T}\)) bin. For \(k_{T}=0.5\) GeV this overshoot has been smeared into the pre-peak bins, giving _them_ an excess. More acceptable values lie in the region from 1 GeV to 1.5 GeV, of which we chose 1.2 GeV.

by the central values of the lower-statistics data used here for tuning. We took advantage of this qualitative knowledge to increase the weighting at the tops of the ATLAS UE transverse profile ramps (the middle rows in Figures 4 and 5) where the MC undershoots. This results in a slight MC overshoot of the \(\sum p_{\mathrm{T}}\) plateau data, slightly improving the quality of the fit to the data region with the smallest statistical errors, and also bringing the plateau fit slightly closer to the full-statistics data than a naive treatment with uniform weightings would have obtained. These extra weightings on the tops of the UE ramps, where the Jimmy model is valid _and_ ATLAS has high-statistics data, are again documented in Table 2.

The resulting tunes, which we collectively title "Jimmy AUET1" (for "ATLAS UE tune #1" in keeping with the nomenclature used for the ATLAS Pythia 6 AMBT1 tune) give a greatly improved description of ATLAS soft QCD data compared to the MC09 tune. The AUET1 tune parameters are shown in Table 1. We note that this improvement has been made at the slight cost of fit quality in the UE data from CDF gathered using the Run I minimum bias trigger. Given the basic nature of the energy evolution ansatz, the lack of parameterisation handles compared to Pythia 6, and the relative importance of ATLAS and CDF fit quality from the point of view of ATLAS simulation production, we consider this to be an acceptable compromise.

Figures 2 to 3 show the spread of tuning results for each parameter against the Professor heuristic \(\chi^{2}\), for each PDF. Each point is from a separate tune, made using various combinations of generator runs at points in the parameter space. The horizontal spread of points indicates the degree of uncertainty in the tune procedure, by using only a subset of 30 out of 39 available points from which to build each tune (or 31 out of 38 for CTEQ6.6). A narrow spread shows well-constrained parameters with little sensitivity to the input MC runs, and hence we see that all three parameters are well-determined, the largest spread being seen for PRRAD in the non-LO\(*\) PDF tunes. The red points are the unique tunes using all available input runs. These are the final AUET1 tune points, and the fact that they lie safely within the spread of run-subset tunes indicates that bias from the parameter sampling is not an issue. Figure 3 also shows the correlation of parameters: EXP is seen to be relatively independent of the other two parameters, especially for the LO\(*\) PDF, while PTJIM\({}_{0}\) and PRRAD are positively correlated. This is expected, since PTJIM\({}_{0}\) and PRRAD have competing effects and hence their tuned values must be positively correlated to maintain quality of fit, as has been seen before in the tuning of similar models [17].

In the CTEQ6.6 tune results, the very different value of EXP is an interesting development which we believe indicates that the Jimmy model and our evolution ansatz are being strained by the data. We have no robust understanding of what drove this strong difference, or whether it is connected to the significant correlation between the cutoff evolution exponent and the hadronic radius parameter: a similar correlation also exists for the CTEQ6L1 tune, which has a similar EXP value to the LO\(*\) tune. A similar study of equivalent tuning of Pythia 6 to three PDFs with the Professor tool resulted in tunes with very stable cutoff exponents, but that model could trade off colour-reconnection and multiple matter distribution parameters (cf. PRRAD) to obtain the best fit. A reassuring physical feature of the AUET1 tunes is that - as seen in the previous Pythia 6 tunes - the PDFs with larger low-\(x\) gluon densities (LO\(*>\) CTEQ6L1 \(>\) CTEQ6.6) naturally produce tunes with larger PTJIM values: this corresponds to stronger regularisation of the divergent cross-section when the gluon density which drives that divergence is larger.

Plots of the most important observables used in the tuning, showing the performance of the three AUET1 tunes, may be found in Figures 4 to 9. The three AUET1 tunes are all of similar quality, and provide a significantly better fit to ATLAS data than the MC09 setup.

Conclusions

In Table 1 we have presented the new "AUET1" set of tunes of the Herwig/Jimmy MC event generator to QCD data from hadron colliders, particularly data from the ATLAS 7 TeV run. The AUET1 tunes give a much-improved description of ATLAS underlying event observables over the previous MC09 tune, at the slight cost of a reduced quality of fit to CDF UE data. Tuning weights have been chosen carefully to maximise the quality of the ATLAS 7 TeV data fit, with anticipation of the higher-statistics update to the ATLAS UE data, which was not available in time for the MC10 tuning deadline.

We have been forced by the lack of colour reconnection in the Jimmy model (as compared to e.g. Pythia 6) to choose whether we consider an accurate description of \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) flows or of charged particle multiplicity flows to be important: we have chosen the former, as it is more important from a physics analysis perspective. In future ATLAS tuning of Herwig/Jimmy, LEP data will be used in an earlier stage to tune the hadronisation parameters and we will attempt to incorporate additional parameters relating to beam remnant fragmentation: it is possible, although as-yet undemonstrated, that these beam remnant changes will improve upon the current description of \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) vs. \(N_{\mathrm{ch}}\).

Additionally, on the recommendation of the authors, AUET1 uses a more sophisticated Herwig setting for initial state radiation than that in MC08/MC09, and we now give primordial transverse momentum to the partons, rectifying a previous tuning oversight. The latter has visible impact on the simulation of the vector boson \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) peak, since the overpopulated zero-\(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) bin from MC08/09 is now smeared out to augment the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) peak at \(\sim\) 2 GeV.

These tunes are now in use as the main Herwig/Jimmy configurations for the ATLAS MC10 production.
