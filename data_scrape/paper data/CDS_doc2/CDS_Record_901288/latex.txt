**Abstract**

During the ATLAS combined testbeam 2004 a full slice of the ATLAS detector was tested. For the hadron calorimeter three barrel modules, and three extended barrel modules were tested. As a first step the performance of the Hadron calorimeter in a "standalone" mode has been investigated. The "standalone" mode was obtained by selecting pions that started to shower in the hadronic calorimeter. Pions at energies from 20 to 350 GeV, and at pseudorapidities from 0.2 to 1.2 were used. The energy resolution, linearity, \(e/h\), and the longitudinal shower profile were studied. The energy resolutions obtained were about \(\sigma/E=52\%/\sqrt{E~{}[GeV]}\oplus 5\%\).

Testbeam setup

In the summer and autumn of 2004 a combined testbeam took place at CERN, where a full barrel slice of the ATLAS experiment was tested. The testbeam table setup which can be seen in figure 1 resembled the geometry and setup of the full ATLAS detector as much as technically possible.

### Calorimeter setup

The electromagnetic calorimeter prototype module (abbreviated LAr) was housed inside a cryostat filled with liquid argon. For the hadron tile calorimeter (TileCal) three barrel, and three Extended Barrel (EB) modules were used. All the TileCal modules except the barrel module at the bottom were production modules. To optimize the containment of hadronic showers the electromagnetic calorimeter was located as close as possible to the back of the cryostat. The distance between the active parts of the two calorimeters was about 30 cm, which is close to the 25 cm foreseen in the ATLAS setup. When running with hadronic extended barrel modules the distance from the barrel modules to the EB modules was larger than the distance in ATLAS, 97 cm instead of 72 cm, see figure 2. During the EB runs the read-out of the barrel drawers with \(\eta<0\) were moved to the EB drawers.

The LAr module is 6.65 m long, spanning \(4\pi/32\) in azimuth, and has a radial depth of 53.4 cm. Radially it is divided into three layers with different segmentation and thickness, see figure 3(a). The first layer is the strip compartment with a thickness of 4.3X\({}_{0}\) and a

Figure 1: Schematic of the testbeam table setup. The beam particles first hit the pixel and SCT modules, and then continue towards the TRT, the calorimeters, and muon modules. In the coordinate system used, the beam travels in the positive \(x\) direction, \(y\) points upwards, and \(z\) points out of the paper, which also is the positive pseudorapidity (\(\eta\)) direction. The table containing the calorimeters could be translated and rotated to simulate that the particles came from the interaction point at different \(\eta\).

granularity of \(\Delta\eta\times\Delta\phi\) = 0.0031 \(\times\) 0.1. The middle layer is the thickest with 16X\({}_{0}\) in depth and is built up by squares of \(\Delta\eta\times\Delta\phi\) = 0.025 \(\times\) 0.0245. The third layer is 2X\({}_{0}\) thick and has granularity of \(\Delta\eta\times\Delta\phi\) = 0.05 \(\times\) 0.025. Presampler modules are placed in front of the strip layer, with a radial thickness of about 1.1 cm, and a granularity of \(\Delta\eta\times\Delta\phi\) = 0.025 \(\times\) 0.1. The \(\eta\) coverage extends up to 1.475.

The hadronic barrel modules are 5.84 m long and the EB modules are 2.28 m long, each spanning \(2\pi/64\) in azimuth, with a radial depth of 1.95 m. The tiles have an unusual orientation, they are placed in planes perpendicular to the colliding beams, and staggered in depth. The tiles span the width of the module in the \(\phi\) direction. The tiles are read out along their two open edges via wave-shifting fibers to two separate Photo-Multiplier Tubes (PMTs). Readout cells are defined by grouping together a set of fibers into a PMT. Radially the modules are segmented into three layers, approximately 1.4, 3.9, and 1.8 interaction length thick at \(\eta\) = 0. The barrel and extended barrel modules have the same \(\Delta\eta\times\Delta\phi\) segmentation of \(0.1\times 0.1\) in the two first layers and \(0.2\times 0.1\) in the last layer. Figure 3(b) shows the principle of the TileCal design.

### The beamline

The H8 beamline provided hadrons, electrons or muons with energies from 1 up to 350 GeV for the combined ATLAS testbeam. The H8 beam is created by extracting an up to 400 GeV proton beam from the Super Proton Synchrotron (SPS) towards the North Area, where the beam is directed onto the primary target. From the primary target (Beryllium,

up to 300 mm) the secondary beam will have energies from 10 to 350 GeV. A secondary filter target, 8 or 16 mm of lead or 1000 mm polyethylene, plus an absorber, air or lead, can be placed in the beam to produce tertiary beams of "pure" electrons (lead plus air) or pions (polyethylene plus lead). The beam can also be diverted onto an additional secondary target further downstream, close to the experiment, to provide energies from 1 to 9 GeV. The beamline instrumentation used by the combined testbeam consists of scintillators, beam chambers, and Cherenkov detectors [2]. These detectors were used for the trigger, to get the beam position, and for particle identification. The beamline instrumentation can be seen in figure 4, including the last beam magnets.

## 2 TileCal standalone

The goal of the combined testbeam for the hadronic studies is of course to study the combined calorimeter response. The study of the TileCal standalone response is performed to make sure TileCal was working properly and to check the quality of the available pion data. To measure the performance of TileCal in a standalone mode the pions that start to shower in TileCal have to be extracted. This was done by requiring a small energy deposition in the LAr calorimeter compatible with that of a minimum ionizing particle (mip). The cryostat scintillator (SC) situated between the LAr cryostat and TileCal modules, and the TileGap scintillator situated on the EB modules (E1 and E2 in figure 2) were used to remove pions that started to shower in the cryostat.

Information on the pion data used are given in section 3. For this study it's very important to remove the pions that start to shower in the cryostat between LAr and TileCal. Therefore

Figure 3: Schematic of the LAr and TileCal module design.

only data where the SC was working properly, or was in the right \(\eta\) position, were used. The efficiency of the SC has been studied, and is reported in section 4. Nevertheless the pions passing the LAr and scintillator cuts will lose energy before reaching TileCal. Even if the energy is small compared to the beam energy it will have an effect on the results, especially for the linearity and \(e/h\) studies. An estimation of the energy lost before TileCal is reported in section 5. The event selection is described in 6, the energy resolution of TileCal is reported in section 7, a small study of the longitudinal shower profile is reported in section 8, and the linearity and \(e/h\) are reported in section 9.

## 3 Data sample and energy reconstruction

For the barrel run periods the following \(\eta\) values were covered: 0.2, 0.25, 0.35, 0.45, 0.55 and 0.65. At each \(\eta\) value pions of the following energies were analysed: 20, 50, 100, 150, 180, 200, 250, 320, 350 GeV. For the extended barrel run periods the following \(\eta\) values were covered: 1.1 and 1.2. At each \(\eta\) value pions of the following energies were analysed: 50, 100, 150, 180, 200, 250 GeV. The true beam energy has been computed according to beam line

Figure 4: Schematic outline of the beamline instrumentation, and also of the ATLAS sub-detector elements. SMV was a scintillator used for tagging particles from the high energy beam line when running at very low energies. S1, S2 and S3 were the scintillators used for the main beam trigger. SMH was a scintillator with a small hole centered on the beam used to remove halo particles. SC was the cryostat scintillator situated between the cryostat and the TileCal modules. SMT was a scintillator used for tagging muons. BC-2 to BC2 were the beam chambers used for position measurements of the beam. The Muon Wall, which was composed of 12 scintillators, can be used to tag events which are not fully contained in the calorimeter.

considerations (measured beam magnet currents). Results are reported in table 1[3].

The barrel runs were taken during different run conditions. The runs at energies of 200 and 250 GeVwere taken during the combined calorimeter run period. The runs at energies of 20, 50, 100, 320, and 350 GeV were from the fully combined run period (including all the detectors). At 150 and 180 GeV data were taken during both periods1. The data was reconstructed using Athena release 9.1.2 with an incorrect pC/GeV factor of 1.1, and a correction was therefore applied to achieve the correct factor of 1.05.

Footnote 1: Data at 350 GeV was also taken during the combined calorimeter run period, but without SC information. Data from the combined calorimeter period will be superscripted with a 1.

## 4 SC efficiency

To evaluate the efficiency of the SC we consider the last LAr layer, em3, and the first TileCal layer, had1. The idea is to select a signal above the mip energy both in em3 and had1, and look at the corresponding signal in SC. Figure 5 shows the signal in SC for all pions (solid line), events with a mip both in em3 and had1 (dashed line), and events with more than a mip energy in em3 and had1 (dotted line). A first look at this plot shows that SC is correctly positioned between the two calorimeters. Indeed events with a lot of interactions in em3 and had1 give the high energy tail part of the signal in SC. Nevertheless there is an overlap between the dashed line and the dotted line. In other words there is a certain amount of events that give a very small signal in SC (i.e. compatible with a mip) whereas there is a big energy deposition before in LAr, and after in TileCal. The SC inefficiency can be defined as:

\[\epsilon=\frac{N(em3>\mbox{\it mip \& had1}>\mbox{\it mip \& SC}<\mbox{\it mip})}{N(em3>\mbox{\it mip \& had1}>\mbox{\it mip})}\]

Results for an intermediate \(\eta\) value (0.35) are given in table 2. First, we can see that the fraction of events with a lot of energy in the last LAr sample and the first TileCal sample and nothing (i.e. SC \(<\) mip) in SC is negligible. That means that there is almost no particles reaching TileCal without passing through SC. \(\epsilon\) can be used as a test of the SC response.

## 5 Energy lost before TileCal

The energy lost before TileCal has been estimated assuming that a pion at its minimum of ionization behaves like a muon, and that the energy lost by ionization is only slightly depending on the energy. The energy a muon leaves in the middle sample of LAr has been measured to be \(\sim\)291 MeV (most probable value) at an \(\eta\) of 0.35 [4]. The middle layer at this \(\eta\) corresponds to about 17 interaction lengths, \(X_{0}\), and the total \(X_{0}\) for all layers is about 25 at that \(\eta\). From this the energy lost in the LAr at different \(\eta\) values can be calculated. The LAr cryostat is composed of two tubes, cold and warm vessel, both with 30 mm thickness. The material is aluminum and the ionization energy loss of a muon can easily be calculated at \(\eta=0\), \(\sim 70\) MeV, and scaled for different path lengths at different \(\eta\) values. The energy lost before TileCal is shown in table 3. The obtained values give of course only a rough estimate of the energy lost by pions before they reach TileCal. A more precise study could be done using a Monte Carlo simulation, including any additional material, as inner detector elements, etc, and also including the cryostat scintillator response.

## 6 Event selection

Physics events were selected by requiring, \(Trig=1\) (the trigger type was defined as 1=physics, 2=laser, 4=pedestal, 8=charge injection, CIS).

Then good physics events were selected, i.e. particles that are well collimated and have not undergone any interactions in the beamline before reaching the calorimeters. This was done using the beamline scintillators, S1, S2, S3 and SMH, and the four beam chambers on the high energy line. The beam chamber cuts used were simple rectangular cuts on the \(x\) and \(y\) coordinate of each beam chamber and can be found in the appendix A. The cuts on the beam scintillators to select good events changed between run periods due to HV changes on the PMTs.

The cuts on the beam scintillators used for the barrel runs were as follows:

\(S1<900\), \(S2<900\), \(S3<900\), \(SMH<900\) ADC counts.

For the extended barrel runs the scintillator cut were as follows:

\(S1<900\), \(S2<2000\), \(S3<2000\), \(SMH<900\) ADC counts.

The cuts on the LAr calorimeter to select pions that behaved as mips were as follows. The muons in each run were selected using the SMT scintillator, \(SMT>500\) ADC counts. The muon energy in an \(\eta\) region of \(\pm 0.2\) around the beam "impact" point in each layer as well as for the total energy in that region were fitted with a Gaussian. The cut on the energy in each layer and on the total energy for the pions was then: \(E<\mu_{fit}+2\times\sigma_{fit}\). In LAr, with the present calibration the \(S/N\) ratio for muons are low, and it is not really possible to distinguish a mip from a pedestal signal. However, the pion energies in LAr was calculated using the same fiducial volume so the noise effects should be the same, and reducing the volume give very similar results. Figures 6(a) and 6(b) show two examples of the muon response for the total energy in the four samples. The number of muons vary with the energy of the beam, and at lower and higher energies the number is lowest. The cuts on the LAr will of course also remove any electrons in the data.

Figure 7 shows what a typical muon and pion signal look like in the SC. The dashed line represents a muon signal. This signal can be used to define the expected mip signal for a pion. The solid line shows the SC signal for pions. It has a large tail, above 400 ADC counts, which corresponds to pions that started to shower before TileCal. The dotted line shows the signal for pions that interacted as mips in the LAr calorimeter. Again there is a significant signal above 400 ADC counts which indicates that these pions started to interact

in the cryostat. The cut on the cryostat scintillator for the barrel runs was: \(SC<350\) ADC counts. For the EB points the cut on the TileGap scintillator was: \(TileGap<2\) GeV.

Figure 7: Typical muon and pion signal in the cryostat scintillator. Run taken at \(\eta=0.25\) and \(200\) GeV.

The muons in the runs were removed using the SMT scintillator, \(SMT>500\) ADC counts. At these energies the muons are of course far from the signal and not a problem.

The number of events left after these cuts varied a lot, depending on the available number of runs, the quality and purity of the data, see table 4. Muons were always present in different quantities, depending on the beam energy, but some runs also had a contamination of electrons, as shown in figure 6. This will affect the number of "standalone" pions left. Runs that were taken with the same run conditions were analysed together.

## 7 Measured energies and resolutions

The resolution is given by the measured spread of the energy divided by the energy (\(\sigma/\mu\)). The measured energy for the barrel runs was defined as the the sum of the energy in all barrel cells with \(\eta>0\). For the EB runs the measured energy was defined as the sum of the energy in all EB cells. The energy distribution was fitted with a Gaussian, \(\pm 2\sigma\) from the mean, and the resolution was calculated for each point. Two examples of the energy distribution and the Gaussian fit are shown in figure 8

The measured mean energy and resolution for the different \(\eta\) positions and beam energies are shown in table 5. Looking at the values obtained from the different run periods, at 150 and 180 GeV, one can clearly see a difference. Both the obtained energies and resolutions are systematically higher for the data taken during the combined calorimeter period. The difference in the energies are small, about 0.4-2.4%, and often within the statistical errors. The difference in the resolution is much higher, about 3-15%. These discrepancies were investigated. The measured energy in the different layers showed the same systematic behaviour. The muon response for the different periods was also studied and showed in general also the same behaviour. Hence the problem was not due to one or a few problematic cells but a global TileCal problem. Perhaps due to a change of the HV of the TileCal PMTs or to different beam settings and conditions.

\end{table}
Table 4: This table shows the number of events left after the cuts. \({}^{*}\) are points were the cryostat scintillator was not available. The number of events left for the EB runs after the cuts is low, and at \(\eta=1.1\), 250 GeV it was very low, and that point was removed. Data from the combined calorimeter period have superscript 1.

At each \(\eta\) value the resolutions are fitted as a function of energy to the standard expression:

\[\sigma/E=a/\sqrt{E}\oplus b \tag{1}\]

where \(a\) represents the statistical fluctuations in the shower development, \(b\) is the constant term which is dominated by the different response to em and hadronic shower components, but also reflects uncertainties in the energy measurements due to mis-calibration, cracks, longitudinal leakage, etc. A third term, \(c\), is often also added which represents the noise (electronic noise, pile-up, etc). However, the noise in TileCal is low, due to a small number of large cells with low noise (\(\sim 25\) MeV). To obtain the resolution parameters, \(a\) and \(b\), only data from the fully combined run period was used. Figures 9 and 10 show plots of the resolution obtained at the different \(\eta\) values. The parameters would not change very much if one included the points from the combined calorimeter period in the fit. The errors in the resolution fits include both statistical uncertainties and uncertainties on the nominal beam energies. Corrections for the energy lost before TileCal have also been applied. A change of \(\pm 50\) MeV on the energy loss values will have very small effect on the obtained resolutions, \(\mathrel{\hbox to 0.0pt{\lower 4.0pt\hbox{ $\sim$}}\raise 1.0pt\hbox{$<$}}0.3\%\) of the obtained values for the 20 GeV points and negligible for higher energies.

To compare with results from older standalone testbeams, in 1997 EB runs at \(\eta=1.1\) and 1.2 and in 1998 barrel runs at \(\eta\) from 0.25 to 0.55, fits with an added \(c/E\) term were also tried. The \(c\) was fixed to 0.06 GeV, as in previous analyses, due to a strong correlation between the \(a\) and \(c\) parameters. This did not change the obtained resolution parameters from the fit. The obtained resolution parameters together with older results from 1997 [5] and 1998 [6] are summed up in table 6. The obtained values are in agreement with the older testbeam results.

## 8 Longitudinal shower development

The longitudinal development of the pion showers was investigated by looking at the mean energy deposited in each sampling layer. The same selection cuts as for the resolution were

## 9 Linearity and \(e/h\)

The Tile calorimeter is a non-compensating calorimeter which means that the response, \(h\), to the deposited hadronic energy is lower than the response, \(e\), for an electromagnetic shower (\(e/h>1\)). A hadron penetrating into a calorimeter will produce a shower with both a hadronic and an electromagnetic component. The electromagnetic part of the shower comes from \(\pi^{0}\) production, which increases slowly with the incident hadron energy. Wigmans parametrization [7] gives an estimation of the electromagnetic fraction in a charged pion shower as a function of the incident pion energy, \(E\):

\[f_{\pi^{0}}=0.11\ln E\ [GeV] \tag{2}\]

The obtained linearities are shown in figures 12 and 13, together with results from the older standalone test beams. Only data from the fully combined run period are shown. The event selection was the same as for the resolution, but for the barrel points the pion energy

Figure 10: The energy resolution obtained at \(\eta\) = 0.55, 0.65, 1.1, 1.2.

was calculated differently to reduce any noise effects. The energy was defined as the sum of the energy in the cells with \(\eta>0\) and with an energy greater than a noise threshold, \(|E_{cell}|>2\sigma_{noise}\). The noise rms for a cell was found to be about 25 MeV. The effect on the measured energy of this cut is only on the order of hundreds of MeV, and will therefore be important only for the lower energies. The obtained linearity values are generally good, and in reasonable agreement with the older values. However, there are some discrepancies. The points at 20 and 50 GeV seem to be systematically too high and the 320 and 350 GeV values too low. The logarithmic increase expected with energy due to the increasing em component is therefore not so visible. The too high values at 20 and 50 GeV might indicate that there are still noise effects, and one improvement would be to use cluster energies instead. The values for the EB points are greatly effected by the very low number of pions. The energy lost before TileCal could be investigated further. The assumption that the energy lost in

At \(\eta=1.1\) and 1.2 two different prototype modules were tested. When comparing the results with the older values one should consider the different setups used, and the number of pions used to obtain the values. Especially at \(\eta=1.1\) and 1.2, where the number of events that are left after the selection is small and the longer distance between the barrel and EB modules changes the \(\eta\) position to actually lower values.

the material in front of TileCal is exactly the same for a pion and a muon might not be entirely correct. However, a change of \(\pm\) 50 MeV on the energy loss values would only move the 20 GeV points with \(\pm\)0.25% of the obtained linearities.

The \(e/h\) ratio can be obtained from the relation between the \(e/\pi\) and the \(e/h\) ratios:

\[e/\pi=\frac{e/h}{1+(e/h-1)\times 0.11\times\ln(E~{}[GeV])} \tag{3}\]

Unfortunately during the combined testbeam it was not possible to get the electron response, since the LAr calorimeter is in front. Nevertheless we can try to fit the values of \(E/E_{beam}\) to this expression:

\[c\times(1+(e/h-1)\times 0.11\times\ln(E~{}[GeV]) \tag{4}\]

However, this expression is in principle only valid if the showers of the particles are fully contained in the calorimeter. This is not the case, and the showers with a large hadronic

component will be less contained than those with a large em fraction. Containment cuts could for example be done using the fraction of energy in the first layer, or using the Muon Wall situated behind TileCal. Any containment cuts will of course affect the obtained \(e/h\) values. To compare with the older results no containment cuts have been applied. The \(e/h\) fits for some \(\eta\) values are shown in figure 14. The obtained \(e/h\) values are 1.13, 1.05, 1.13, and 1.14 for \(\eta\) values 0.25, 0.35, 0.65, and 1.1, respectively. For the other \(\eta\) values the fits are worse and the \(e/h\) values are around 1.05. The obtained values are lower than those from the older testbeams, which are 1.61, 1.39, 1.41, 1.38 and 1.48 for \(\eta\) values 0.35, 0.45, 0.55, 1.1, and 1.2, respectively.

The obtained \(e/h\) values and the comparison with the older values should be viewed with some caution, as the beam energy was used instead of the electron response, and the setup in the older testbeams, as modules and electronics, was different. The too high values

at the low energy points as well as the too low values at the high energy points is also a concern. A study that could be performed is to do the same analysis on data from the 2002 and 2003 standalone testbeams, since the TileCal setup during these years was more like the one in 2004. However, there were less number of \(\eta\) and energy points covered during those testbeams.

## 10 Summary and outlook

The energy resolutions obtained were about \(\sigma/E=52\%/\sqrt{E\ [GeV]}\oplus 5\%\) for all but the highest \(\eta\) point of 1.2 where it was about \(\sigma/E=38\%/\sqrt{E\ [GeV]}\oplus 6\%\). The obtained resolutions are comparable to the results from the 1997 and 1998 standalone testbeams. At

For \(\eta\) values 1.1 and 1.2 the open rings and squares refer to the two different modules tested. All the points are normalized to the 100 GeVpoint.

\(\eta=0.35\) and \(0.55\) the obtained resolutions were \(\sigma/E=(54.6\pm 1.8)\%/\sqrt{E\ [GeV]}\oplus(5.6\pm 0.2)\%\) and \(\sigma/E=(51.2\pm 1.6)\%/\sqrt{E\ [GeV]}\oplus(5.2\pm 0.2)\%\), respectively, compared to the old values of \(\sigma/E=56.3\%/\sqrt{E\ [GeV]}\oplus 6.9\%\) and \(\sigma/E=55.2\%/\sqrt{E\ [GeV]}\oplus 5.1\%\) at \(\eta=0.35\) and \(0.55\), respectively. The obtained linearities are generally good, and in reasonable agreement with older results. There are some discrepancies, the points at 20 and 50 GeV seem to be systematically too high and the 320 and 350 GeV values too low. However, all the points are within 3% of each other.

The difference between the measured energies and resolutions between the different run periods needs to be understood. Further investigations of the linearity and \(e/h\) ratio could be performed. For example the energy lost before TileCal needs to be investigated, and a cluster algorithm could be used to calculate the measured energy to reduce the effects of any noise. One could also perform the same analysis on data from the 2002 and 2003 test beams, since the TileCal setup during these years was more like the one in 2004.

However, TileCal seems to be working properly, and the next step would be to do a fully combined TileCal plus LAr analysis. The LAr calorimeter is now in the final calibration stage, using optimal filtering constants. A first study that could be performed is to look at the response in LAr for some runs from both run periods. This would answer the question if the difference in measured values are due to TileCal or the beam. The combined response could be investigated for example using first the benchmark approach, and then more advanced techniques, as weighting, etc. Monte Carlo simulation studies should of course also be performed.
