Introduction

The identification of the low transverse momentum (\(p_{T}<20\) GeV/c) electrons inside jets was studied in [1] with the first implementation of the algorithm within the Athena framework. This note aims to provide a realistic evaluation of the soft electron identification and \(b\)-tagging performance. The data used include pile-up at low and high luminosities. Different analysis tools, the likelihood ratio and the neural network method, are used.

The note is organised as follows. Data samples used in this analysis are described in section 2. Performance of the electron identification procedures is given in section 3. Finally the soft electron \(b\)-tagging performance is given in section 4.

## 2 Data samples

### Simulation

The samples contain events from Higgs-boson associated production, \(WH\) with \(W\to\mu\nu\). The signal sample consists of \(H\to b\bar{b}\) events and background samples of \(H\to c\bar{c},u\bar{u}\) events. The mass of the Higgs boson is set to \(m_{H}=120\) GeV/c\({}^{2}\).

The Monte Carlo events were generated for DC1 [2] with Pythia 6.203 [3] under the Athena framework and stored in Root format [4]. Those events were simulated in the ATLAS detector with GEANT 3 [5] based on ATLASIM/DICE program [6], version 3.2.1. The inputs were the event kinematics from Root-format files and the output was the detector hits and digits in ZEBRA-format files. Pile-up is added to study these events for the low luminosity (\(2\times 10^{33}\) cm\({}^{-2}\) s\({}^{-1}\)) and the high luminosity (\(10^{34}\) cm\({}^{-2}\) s\({}^{-1}\)) scenarios. The number of pile-up events per bunch crossing follows a Poisson distribution with an average of 4.6 at low and 23 at high luminosities.

### Reconstruction

These DC1 data were reconstructed using Athena release 7.8.0. In particular following parameters were used:

* tracks in the Inner Detector were reconstructed using xKalman. All options were set to the default values, and the correction for internal bremsstrahlung losses was enabled;
* jets were reconstructed using the cone algorithm with the default options (cone size 0.7);
* electronics noise in the calorimeters was included.

\end{table}

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:4]

As can be noticed from Fig. 1 and Tab. 2, the kinematics of electrons and pions is almost not changed in the different luminosity scenarios. The presence of pile-up events makes the pattern recognition more difficult. It increases the track multiplicity and the probability of selecting fake or lower quality track. The tracks will be also less isolated. All of these will render the electron identification more difficult in presence of pile-up.

## 3 Electron identification

### Overview of the soft electron identification

All the _good quality_ tracks are extrapolated to the subsequent calorimeter samplings. The cell with the maximum deposit is searched in the vicinity of the extrapolated position. The following \(\eta\) and \(\phi\) windows are used: \(3\times 3\) in the presampler, \(3\times 1\) in the strip compartment, \(3\times 3\) in the middle sampling, \(3\times 1\) in the back sampling. In each sampling of the calorimeter the list of cells around the impact point is established in following windows: \(3\times 5\) in the presampler, \(19\times 5\) in the strip compartment, \(9\times 13\) in the middle sampling, \(5\times 13\) in the back sampling. Then a cluster is created and a set of discriminating variables is defined basing on transverse and longitudinal shapes of electromagnetic showers, track information in the Inner Detector (ID), ID-Calo matching in position and energy and transition radiation information. All variables are in the standard combined ntuple. The analysis is then performed with a set of Root macros/Paw kumacs.

### Discriminating variables

The variables used to identify reconstructed tracks as electrons and to reject other tracks can be classified as follows:

Figure 1: _Normalised distributions of \(p_{T}\) and \(|\eta|\) for signal electrons in \(H\to b\bar{b}\) (solid line), background electrons (dashed line) and pions (hatched histograms) in background samples, low luminosity data._

- Variables using ID information only:

* number of high energy hits in the TRT detector on the track;
* transverse impact parameter.

-Variables using combined information from the ID and the LArEM:

* the ratio of the transverse energy reconstructed in the LArEM, to the transverse momentum reconstructed in the ID;
* difference between the track and the shower positions measured in units of distance between the strips, where \(i_{m}\) is the impact cell for the track reconstructed in the ID and \(E_{i}\) is the energy reconstructed in the \(i\)-th cell in the \(\eta\) direction for constant \(\phi\) given by the track parameters.

- Variables using LArEM information only:

* fraction of the energy reconstructed in the first compartment of the LArEM;
* fraction of the energy reconstructed in the third compartment of the LArEM;
* shower isolation in the LArEM from the ratio of energy reconstructed around the extrapolation in a \(3\times 3\) and \(3\times 7\) clusters;

- calculated using the highest energetic strip and its neighbour on each side.

More details on the presented variables can be found in [1]. Distributions of each variable for signal electrons from \(H\to b\overline{b}\) and pions from background samples are shown in Fig. 2.

Fig. 3 and 4 show the distributions of the mean values of each discriminating variable, for signal electrons and pions from low luminosity data, as a function of \(|\eta|\) or \(p_{T}\). The variables show a significant dependence on the pseudorapidity and a less pronounced one on the transverse momentum.

In \(\eta\) the changes correspond to varying granularities, lead thickness and material in front of the electromagnetic calorimeter. The separation between the distributions obtained for electrons and pions can vary also with \(\eta\). Thus, the discriminating power of each variable varies.

Figure 3: _Mean values of the discriminating variables for the signal electrons (circles) and pions (triangles) in function of \(|\eta|\). Dependencies are shown for samples at low luminosity._

Separation variableIn order to estimate the discriminating power of each variable, an estimator called raw separation is defined [11][12]:

\[<s_{raw}^{2}(x)>=\frac{1}{2}\int\frac{(\rho^{b}(x)-\rho^{s}(x))^{2}}{\rho^{b}(x) +\rho^{s}(x)}dx, \tag{1}\]

where \(x\) is the variable for which the separation is calculated. This definition assumes that \(\rho^{s}(x)\), the probability that the track originates from a signal electron, and \(\rho^{b}(x)\), the probability that the track originates from non-signal hadron, are normalised to the unity. Tab. 3 shows the raw separation values, ranked by decreasing order, obtained for each discriminating variable. The most discriminating is the number of TRT high threshold hits \(n_{TR}\). It is the only variable which shows significant drop of its separation value in the presence of pile-up. It is in good agreement with statements presented in [13]. At high luminosity, other particles, including electrons from \(\gamma\)-conversions, deposit energy in the straws crossed by the particles of interest. This causes an increase in the number of high threshold hits for both pions and electrons. The average number of TR hits per reconstructed track increases by 1.4 for pions and by 1.2 for electrons. The pion rejection

is determined by the size of the regions of overlap in Fig. 5 for the low and the high luminosity scenarios. The loss of separation corresponds to a loss of the discriminating power of this variable at high luminosity.

The variables describing the energy deposit in each sampling do not have the same separation. The \(E_{3}/E\) variable is less discriminating than the \(E_{1}/E\). This is due to the fact that the ratio \(E_{3}/E\) is equal to 0 for about a third of electrons and pions. When there is energy deposit in the third sampling, its discriminating power is similar to the one of the \(E_{1}/E\) variable.

Correlation between variablesThe discriminating variables could be correlated. The linear correlation coefficient between variables \(\mu\) and \(\nu\) is given by:

\[r_{\mu\nu} = \frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^{N}\frac{(x_{\mu i}-\bar{x}_{\mu})(x_{\nu i }-\bar{x}_{\nu})}{\sigma(x_{\mu})\sigma(x_{\nu})}, \tag{2}\]

the indices \(\mu\) and \(\nu\) run over all discriminating variables, \(\bar{x}\) is the mean value of the distribution of the variable \(x\) and \(\sigma(x)\) its rms. All details concerning correlation coefficients can be found in Tab. 10 and 11 in appendix A.

Figure 5: _The number of the TRT high threshold hits for signal electrons (hatched histograms) and for pions in background sample (empty histograms). Distributions are shown for data with the low luminosity (left) and the high luminosity (right) conditions._

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|} \hline  & no pile-up & low-lumi & high-lumi \\ \hline \(n_{TR}\) & 0.75 & 0.69 & 0.53 \\ \hline \(E/p\) & 0.47 & 0.45 & 0.43 \\ \hline \(E_{1}/E\) & 0.49 & 0.49 & 0.44 \\ \hline \(A_{0}\) & 0.32 & 0.32 & 0.31 \\ \hline \(POS\) & 0.23 & 0.22 & 0.22 \\ \hline \(E_{3}/E\) & 0.21 & 0.21 & 0.21 \\ \hline \(WIDTH\) & 0.15 & 0.15 & 0.13 \\ \hline \(ISO\) & 0.15 & 0.14 & 0.14 \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 3: _The raw separation of each discriminating variable._The variables \(n_{TR}\) and \(A_{0}\) obtained from the ID only are, as expected, not correlated with those obtained from the LArEM. For other variables, the correlation coefficients are rather low, never exceeding \(\sim 30\%\). These low values do not exclude the more complicated, non-linear dependencies between variables, different for signal and background, which can be exploited by non-linear techniques. It can be also noticed that variables dealing with energy reconstructed in the LArEM show larger correlation for signal events than for background ones.

It should be stressed that two highly correlated variables, when combined, can be more discriminating than two other variables which are not correlated, if the correlation coefficient for signal and background is different enough.

### Results with a ratio of likelihood

#### 3.3.1 Construction of the discriminating function

The distributions of the discriminating variables are treated as probability density functions (PDFs). As already seen in section 3.2, these PDFs show a significant dependence on the pseudorapidity. In previous study [1] a dedicated data sample of \(H\to b\bar{b}\) filtered for electrons from semileptonic decays has been produced. The statistics was high enough to obtain PDFs in five pseudorapidity bins (but still not enough to optimise PDFs also in \(p_{T}\)). No pile-up has been added on this filtered sample. It is thus not possible to optimise PDFs with the pseudorapidity, for all luminosity scenarios, as they would have to be determined on typically few tens of events.

A simple method is based on the use of relative likelihood and constructed from the distribution of the discriminating variables for the two classes of events (\(s\) for signal and \(b\) for background) which should be disentangled. Ideally, for \(N\) discriminating variables, the ratio of likelihood can be written as:

\[X_{RL}=\frac{\mathcal{L}^{s}(x_{1},...x_{N})}{\mathcal{L}^{s}(x_{1},...x_{N})+ \mathcal{L}^{b}(x_{1},...x_{N})}, \tag{3}\]

where \(\mathcal{L}^{s}=g^{s}(x_{1},...x_{N})\) is the \(N\) dimensional density distribution (or likelihood) for signal hypothesis, and \(\mathcal{L}^{b}=g^{b}(x_{1},...x_{N})\) for background hypothesis. Obtaining the distributions from a histogram in \(N\) dimension being a difficult task, the following approximation is usually made:

\[X_{RL}=\frac{\prod_{i}\rho_{i}^{s}(x_{i})}{\prod_{i}\rho_{i}^{s}(x_{i})+\prod_ {i}\rho_{i}^{b}(x_{i})}, \tag{4}\]

where \(\rho_{i}^{s}(x_{i})\) (resp. \(\rho_{i}^{b}(x_{i})\)) is the one dimensional density distribution of the variable \(x_{i}\) for events of signal hypothesis (resp. background). Several points should be underlined:

* \(X_{RL}\) tends to 1 for signal events and tends to 0 for background events;
* if a discriminating variable \(x_{i}\) is not useful (\(\rho_{i}^{s}(x_{i})\sim\rho_{i}^{b}(x_{i})\)) over all the range considered for \(x_{i}\), it does not dilute the information from the other discriminating variables;
* if there is no correlation between the different discriminating variables, the combined variable \(X_{RL}\) is optimal;
* in case of correlations between the discriminating variables, some information is lost. Nevertheless, the use of \(X_{RL}\) as a new discriminating variable insures that no bias is introduced in the analysis. However, care should be taken not to incorporate too many correlated variables to avoid a dilution of the discriminating power.

To avoid any bias of performance the samples to estimate this discriminating function has to be different from the ones which provided the PDFs. For the PDFs preparation we used half of available \(H\to b\bar{b}\), \(H\to u\bar{u}\) and \(H\to c\bar{c}\) samples.

Distributions of \(X_{\it RL}\) obtained for signal electron and background pion tracks are shown in Fig. 6. The ratio of likelihood does not take into account correlations between the variables. It is reflected in the the distributions obtained for electrons and pions which overlap and present large tails.

#### 3.3.2 Performance

The identification of a candidate track as originating from a signal electron is based on the value of the discriminating function \(X_{\it RL}\) assigned to the given track. The identification efficiency versus the rejection power of the algorithm is obtained by varying the value of the threshold on \(X_{\it RL}\).

To quantify the performance of the identification procedure, the following quantities are defined:

- electron identification efficiency: \[\varepsilon_{e}=\frac{N_{e}^{t}}{N_{e}},\] (5)

where \(N_{e}\) is the number of _good quality_ signal electron tracks in the signal samples and \(N_{e}^{t}\) is the number of _good quality_ signal electron tracks identified as a signal electrons track;

- charged pion rejection: \[R_{\pi}=\frac{N_{\pi}}{N_{\pi}^{t}},\] (6)

where \(N_{\pi}\) is the number of _good quality_ pion tracks, and \(N_{\pi}^{t}\) is the number of _good quality_ pion tracks misidentified as a signal electron track. The pion rejection factors obtained for various electron identification efficiency \(\varepsilon_{e}\) are presented in Tab. 4 and in Fig. 7 for

Figure 6: _Normalised distributions of the discriminating function \(X_{\it RL}\) for signal electron tracks in \(H\to b\bar{b}\) (dashed) and pions in \(H\to u\bar{u}\) (empty). Low luminosity data._

the various types of samples. For no pile-up data and \(\varepsilon_{e}=80\%\) the rejection of pion tracks in \(H\to b\bar{b}\) is \(245\pm 17\), in \(H\to u\bar{u}\) is \(561\pm 35\) and in \(H\to c\bar{c}\) is \(508\pm 54\). Differences between pion rejection in different jets are due to the \(A_{0}\) variable which is the most discriminating in case of pions from \(u\)-jets. Compared to previous study [1] performance is higher by about \(40\%\) (this number can vary with the efficiency) as the analysis code was improved and some bugs fixed. The same figure and table show also performance obtained at low and high luminosity. For the low luminosity case, pion rejection is lower by about \(30\%\). As shown in Tab. 3 the number of TRT high threshold hits variable is less discriminating when taking into account pile-up events. Appendix B shows performance obtained without using the \(n_{TR}\) variable, and clearly demonstrates, that the loss of efficiency is due to this particular variable. The effect is even more pronounced at high luminosity, where the rejection of pions in \(b\bar{b}\) sample is \(70\%\) lower than in the case of no pile-up, or \(60\%\) compared to the low luminosity case. Once again the loss is essentially due to the \(n_{TR}\) variable.

### Results with a neural network

#### 3.4.1 Construction of the discriminating function

The neural network is a non-linear discriminating method (a detailed description of the neural network techniques can be found in [8]). The Stuttgart Neural Network Simulator [9] was used in the analysis. The architecture of the network is optimized to give the proper classification of signal and background and to avoid over-training at the same time. The neural network is built as follows (Fig. 8):

* an input layer with 8 input nodes corresponding to 8 discriminating variables;
* two internal hidden layers, each containing 16 nodes;
* an output layer containing a single neuron, since the output is a single discriminating variable.

To each neuron \(j\) in the hidden layer \(n\) inputs \(x_{k},k=1,..,n\) and one output variable (the answer of the neuron) \(z_{j}\) are associated. For the first hidden layer the inputs are the discriminating variables, for next layers the inputs are the outputs of the preceding layer. All input variables are normalized to be within the range \([-1,1]\).

\end{table}
Table 4: _Rejection of pions in various samples for varying identification efficiency \(\varepsilon_{e}\) and different luminosities using likelihood._The neuron sums up the input variables \(y_{k}\), weighted by a factor \(w_{jk}\), plus a threshold \(\theta_{j}\). This defines the signal \(Z_{j}\):

\[Z_{j}=\sum_{k=1}^{N}w_{jk}y_{k}+\theta_{j}. \tag{7}\]

The output of the neuron is a function of \(Z\): \(z_{j}=a(Z_{j}),\) where \(a\) is called the activation function, and is chosen to be of the form \(a(x)=1/2(1+tanh(x))\). The training phase of the neural network consists in determining the weighting factors \(w_{jk}\) and the thresholds \(\theta_{j}\). This is done by minimizing the following error function:

\[E=\frac{1}{2}\sum_{i=1}^{n}\left(X_{NN}^{i}-t_{1}^{i}\right)^{2}, \tag{8}\]

where \(t_{1}^{i}\) is the expected output (0 for background, 1 for signal), \(X_{NN}^{i}\) the actual value returned by the network and \(n\) is a number of events used for training. The training is

performed using half of the available signal data (electrons from \(H\to b\overline{b}\) process) and half of the \(H\to u\bar{u}\) and \(H\to c\overline{c}\) samples. The remaining data are used to obtain the signal detection efficiency and background rejection. It is also used as a verification sample to check, whether the values \(E\) obtained for training and verification samples are similar. This gives a useful information when to interrupt the network training (see Fig. 8). The training is stopped after about 350 training cycles to avoid over-learning. Since majority of the background part of the training sample are pions from the \(H\to u\bar{u}\) process the network is tuned to reject most efficiently this type of background. The results obtained using a network optimized to reject pions from \(H\to b\overline{b}\) are shown in Appendix C. Distributions of the neural network output \(X_{NN}\) obtained for signal electron and background pion tracks are shown in Fig 9.

pion tracks in \(H\to b\bar{b}\) is \(268\pm 19\), in \(H\to u\bar{u}\) is \(1245\pm 114\) and in \(H\to c\bar{c}\) is \(877\pm 181\). The use of neural network gives \(\sim 120\%\) gain in the pion rejection in \(H\to u\bar{u}\) sample and \(\sim 70\%\) in \(H\to c\bar{c}\) sample comparing to the ratio of likelihood method. In the Fig. 11 and Tab. 6 results obtained with a neural network are compared with the ones obtained using the ratio of likelihood (for \(H\to u\bar{u}\) sample). It can be clearly seen that the neural network approach gives significantly better rejection for the same signal identification efficiency.

Soft electron \(b\)-tagging

The soft electron \(b\)-tagging method complements the secondary vertex tagging [10] via its sensitivity to the leptonic b-decays. The branching ratio of \(B\)-meson decays to leptons is about 10.5% per lepton family.

### Overview of the soft electron \(b\)-tagging

The soft electron \(b\)-tagging method is based on the electron identification procedure:

* for each track in the jet the value of the discriminating function \(D_{track}\) is calculated using one of two methods: \[D_{track}=\left\{\begin{array}{ll}X_{RL}&\mbox{likelihood method}\\ X_{NN}&\mbox{Neural Network method}\end{array}\right.\]
* for each jet the track with the highest value of \(D_{track}\) is chosen and its value of the discriminating function is taken as the value of the discriminating function for the jet, \(D_{jet}~{}=~{}max(D_{track})\);
* for a given threshold \(D_{jet}^{thr}\) a jet with \(D_{jet}\geq D_{jet}^{thr}\) is tagged as a \(b\)-jet.

Jets are reconstructed with the standard cone algorithm and labeled as originating from a \(b\)-quark, if a quark with \(p_{T}^{b}>5\) GeV/c (after FSR) is found in a cone \(\Delta R=\sqrt{\left[\Delta\eta(e,b)\right]^{2}+\left[\Delta\phi(e,b)\right] ^{2}}<0.2\) around the jet axis. The labeling for \(c\)- and \(u\)-jets is done in the same way.

The mean multiplicity of tracks inside jets with at least one reconstructed track with \(p_{T}>2\) GeV/c inside a cone \(\Delta R<0.4\) around the jet axis increase from the low to the high luminosity scenario: for \(b\)-jets from 3.7 to 4.3, for \(u\)-jets from 3.4 to 3.8 and for \(c\)-jets from 3.5 to 4.0. This will make \(b\)-tagging more difficult in the high luminosity samples.

The fraction of labeled jets containing electron tracks with \(p_{T}>2\) GeV/c is given in Tab. 7 for all types of jets and for different luminosity scenarios. The dominant source of electrons in \(b\)-jets are electrons from semileptonic decays of \(b\)-hadrons and \(d\)-hadrons. The semileptonic decays of \(d\)-hadrons occur frequently in \(c\)-jets. The \(u\)-jets are almost free from signal electrons.

In \(u\)-jets the main sources of electrons are \(\gamma\)-conversions and Dalitz decays. The presence of any electron in the background jets makes their rejection difficult (as the method uses electrons as tagging particles). As can be concluded from Tab. 7 the best rejection factor can be achieved for \(u\)-jets and the worst for \(c\)-jets. For events with pile-up the fraction of jets with signal electrons does not change, but the fraction of jets with background electrons increases in case of \(H\to u\bar{u}\) and \(b\bar{b}\) events making \(b\)-tagging less effective.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|} \hline Jet type & \(b\)-hadrons & \(d\)-hadrons & \(\gamma\)-conversions and \(\pi^{0}\) Dalitz & Other sources \\ \hline \(b\)-jets & 6.6/6.7/6.5 & 4.2/4.3/4.2 & 1.5/1.6/2.0 & 0.4/0.4/0.4 \\ \hline \(u\)-jets & \(-/\!-\!/-\) & \(-/\!-\)/\(-\) & 1.6/1.7/2.4 & 0.1/0.1/0.1 \\ \hline \(c\)-jets & \(-/\!-\!/-\) & 4.8/4.7/4.6 & 1.4/1.4/1.4 & 0.1/0.1/0.1 \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 7: _Fraction of jets with electrons (in %) of a given origin Numbers are given for no pile-up/low luminosity/high luminosity events._The efficiency of the \(b\)-tagging algorithm is defined as:

\[\varepsilon_{b}^{alg}=\frac{N_{b}^{t}}{N_{b}^{e}}. \tag{9}\]

where \(N_{b}^{t}\) is number of the tagged \(b\)-jets and \(N_{b}^{e}\) is the number of labeled \(b\)-jets with at least one electron with \(p_{T}>2\) GeV/c after _good quality_ cuts.

The jet rejection factor is calculated as following:

\[R_{jet}=\frac{N_{j}}{N_{j}^{t}}, \tag{10}\]

where \(j\) is a given jet type (\(u\),\(c\)), \(N_{j}\) is the number of labeled jets of type \(j\) in the \(H\to j\overline{j}\) sample with at least one _good quality_ track with \(p_{T}>2\) GeV/c inside the jet cone, and \(N_{j}^{t}\) is the number of labeled \(j\)-type jets tagged as \(b\)-jets.

The fraction of reconstructed \(b\)-jets with an electron track within a cone \(\Delta R\leq 0.4\) around the jet axis is defined as the effective branching ratio \(BR\) and dependents on the performance of the detector. This value is normalised to the total number of reconstructed \(b\)-labeled jets, with at least one _good quality_ tracks with \(p_{T}>2\) GeV/c inside the jet cone. For the sample of \(H\to b\overline{b}\), this fraction is \(BR\sim 13\%\). The soft electron \(b\)-tagging efficiency, \(\varepsilon_{b}^{soft}\), can be calculated by multiplying the efficiency of the \(b\)-tagging algorithm, \(\varepsilon_{b}^{alg}\), by the obtained branching ratio \(BR\). Thus, 60% efficiency of the \(b\)-tagging algorithm with \(p_{T}^{track}>2\) GeV/c, corresponds to \(\varepsilon_{b}^{soft}\sim 7.8\%\).

### Performance

Fig. 12 shows the rejection factors for \(u\)- and \(c\)-jets as a function of the \(b\)-tagging algorithm efficiency for different luminosity scenarios and for both methods, the ratio of likelihood and the neural network. The achieved rejection factors for non-\(b\) jets are presented in Tab. 8.

For a \(b\)-tagging efficiency of 60%, the rejection of \(u\)-jets is \(151\pm 11\) for the likelihood and \(66\pm 13\) for the neural network method when no pile-up is taken into account. It decreases by \(\sim 10\%\) for the low luminosity case and by \(\sim 30\%\) for the high luminosity scenario. As already explained in section 3.3.2 and detailed in annexe B, this loss is due to the high threshold hits in the TRT variable which is less discriminating when pile-up is important. The rejection of \(c\)-jets shows only small degradation in the high luminosity events. The gain from using a neural network can be seen only for high efficiencies of \(b\)-tagging (see Fig. 12) when background jets are tagged mainly by pions. For low efficiencies of the algorithm where jets are tagged mainly by background electrons there is no improvement from a method giving better pion rejection and both methods, the likelihood and the neural network, give similar results.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|} \hline  & method & no pile-up & low lumi & high lumi \\ \hline  & RL & \(151\pm 11\) & \(136\pm 9\) & \(104\pm 11\) \\ \cline{2-5} \(R_{u}\) & NN & \(166\pm 13\) & \(144\pm 10\) & \(123\pm 15\) \\ \hline  & RL & \(35\pm 2\) & \(36\pm 2\) & \(33\pm 3\) \\ \cline{2-5} \(R_{e}\) & NN & \(35\pm 2\) & \(35\pm 2\) & \(33\pm 3\) \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 8: _Jet rejection factors for efficiencies of \(b\)-tagging algorithm \(\varepsilon_{b}^{alg}=60\) % obtained with the ratio of likelihood (RL) and the neural network (NN) methods for different luminosity scenarios_.

Tab. 9 shows the fraction of jets tagged by a given type of track for \(\varepsilon_{b}^{alg}~{}=~{}60\%\). Most of the jets are tagged by true electron tracks, independently of the jet type. It indicates, that the electron identification procedure works with a high efficiency and good purity. Most of the electron tracks which tag jets, except for \(u\)-jets, are signal electron tracks (from \(b\)- or \(d\)-hadron decays). For the \(b\)-jet sample, these tracks tag 89.9% of all tagged jets. The sample of \(u\)-jets almost does not contain electrons from \(b\) and \(d\), but these jets are tagged, in 65.7%, by the electron tracks from \(\gamma\)-conversions and Dalitz decays.

## 5 Conclusion

In this note the soft electron identification and \(b\)-tagging results are discussed. The performance is detailed on samples \(WH\), \(H\to b\overline{b}\), \(c\overline{c}\) and \(u\bar{u}\) produced during the ATLAS Data Challenge 1. Compared to previous study, the emphasis of the note is put on performance obtained for the low and high luminosity scenarios. Performance obtained

Plots for events from no-pile up samples (top panel), the low luminosity samples (middle panel) and the high luminosity samples (bottom panel)._

are similar for the low luminosity scenario and for no pile-up events. On the contrary performance decreases by 70% for the high luminosity case for rejection of pions and by 30% for rejection of \(u\)-jets. The loss is due to the number of high threshold hits in the TRT which becomes less discriminating in presence of pile-up.

To deal with non-linear dependencies between discriminating variables the neural network method is used to obtain the optimal performance. It gives \(\sim 100\%\) improvement in the pion rejection. Using this method for \(b\)-tagging purpose a gain can be observed only for high b-tagging algorithm efficiencies.

Effect of TRT on performance

This section is devoted on the individual effect of the high threshold hits variable \(n_{TR}\) on the performance of the algorithm. The likelihood method is used.

As described in Tab. 3 the \(n_{TR}\) variable is the most discriminating variable used by the algorithm. Fig. 13 shows the pion rejection as a function of the electron identification efficiency, \(\varepsilon_{e}\), without the use of the \(n_{TR}\) variable. In the \(H\to b\bar{b}\) sample, for low luminosity case and \(\varepsilon_{e}=80\) %, the pion rejection is 30, about 5 times smaller than when using it. The second observation, is that rejection is then similar for the different luminosity scenarios. Thus, the difference of performance observed in Fig. 7 and Tab. 4 for the different luminosity scenarios, in particular for the high luminosity case, is essentially due to the loss of rejection power of the \(n_{TR}\) variable.

Fig. 14 shows performance of the algorithm in terms of rejection of \(u\)-jets (left panel) and c-jets (right panel) as a function of the \(b\)-tagging algorithm efficiency \(\varepsilon_{b}^{alg}\), for different luminosity scenarios.
