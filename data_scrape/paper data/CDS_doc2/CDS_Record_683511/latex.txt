Introduction

The R.D.34 project was initiated at the beginning of 1993 with the aim of exploring new concepts of scintillating hadron calorimetry while developing a suitable hadronic device for the ATLAS experiment at LHC. At that time ATLAS had already chosen the LAr technique (Accordion concept) for the electromagnetic (EM) barrel compartment; this constraint turned the investigation towards hybrid calorimeter configurations.

The starting point was to build a simple state-of-the-art sampling calorimeter based on steel absorber and plastic scintillator tiles, read out by wavelength shifting (WLS) fibers. The choice of steel was driven by cost and by the need to return the magnetic flux of the ATLAS inner solenoid.

New to this approach is the orientation of the scintillator tiles within the absorber. To allow a simple, economical and modular assembly, tiles lie in planes perpendicular to the colliding beams; for better sampling homogeneity, tiles are staggered in the radial direction (corresponding to the shower axis for small \(\eta\)). Radially oriented WLS fibres collect light from the tiles at both of their open edges and bring it to photomultipliers (PMTs) at the periphery of the calorimeter. Each PMT views a specific group of tiles, through the corresponding bundle of fibers; with this readout scheme three-dimensional segmentation is immediately obtained.

Early Monte Carlo studies [1] and 1993 test beam results [2] showed that even for isolated hadrons at small \(\eta\) uniformity and energy resolution are very good. This is due to the transverse spread of hadronic showers and to the radial staggering of the tiles. These two aspects together make for short secondary particle track lengths.

In the first year of the project (1993) a three-module prototype calorimeter was constructed and tested in standalone mode (no em section in front) at the SPS. Besides confirming expectations on uniformity and energy resolution, the data showed that excellent signal linearity could be obtained by a simple sampling correction method. These results, now published [3], proved the validity of the idea and led ATLAS to adopt this concept for the barrel hadronic calorimeter (Tile calorimeter, \(|\eta|<1.6\)).

Understanding of the hybrid environment, wherein the Tile calorimeter is preceded by about 1.2 interaction lengths of LAr A recordion em calorimeter, was the main motivation for extending the project through 1994 and 1995. For this second step two additional prototype modules were constructed and instrumented. The combined run took place at the end of 1994.

In the meanwhile detailed component R&D efforts were carried out in order to further improve the calorimeter performance and the construction technique was reviewed and optimized, in view of the construction of the large (2800 ton) ATLAS device.

This report summarizes all such activities. First, the development of the mechanical aspects and of the optical and readout components is described. Considerable progress has been made in the quality of the scintillator, which is produced directly by RD34; in particular the light yield and the uniformity of the response across a single tile have been substantially improved in two years of detailed investigations. Newly available WLS fibers and PMTs have been extensively tested, with very encouraging results. And finally, much experience has been gained in intercalibrating and monitoring the response of the calorimeter.

In the second part of the report the most significant results from the combined and standalone beam tests are presented. Particular emphasis is given to the response to pions and muons, as well as to the results of calibration and stability monitoring.

A rather complete design of the ATLAS barrel calorimeter, based on the experience of almost three years of R&D, is now available, and construction of the ATLAS calorimeter module prototype has begun. Some aspects of this endeavour are briefly touched on in the final section.

This progress was only possible with the contributions of the many institutions that joined the few initial groups. The collaboration counts now on 19 institutions, which give it a solid technical base and the strength necessary to accomplish the necessary tasks.

## 2 Detector Construction and Components R&D

### Prototypes Construction (Mechanics)

Five 1 m long prototypes have been constructed, each one spanning 2\(\pi\)/64 in azimuth, with a front face of 100 \(\times\) 20 cm\({}^{2}\). The radial depth is 180 cm, going from an inner radius of 200 cm to an outer radius of 380 cm; it corresponds to about 9 interaction lengths. Mechanically the construction consists of a stack of laminated steel plates of different precut shapes (master and spacer plates). Details about the procedure adopted for the construction of the five modules can be found in Ref. [3]. As an illustrative example, Fig. 1b shows an exploded view of the basic repetitive elements of the stack (period). Each period is 18 mm thick and consists of four layers. The first and third layer are composed of large trapezoidal plates (masters), the second and the fourth layers alternate small steel plates (spacers) and scintillator tiles. The scintillator plates are inserted once the stack is completed and compressed.

This experience has clarified several experimental aspects of the construction. First of all it became evident that the stacking of iron plates is particularly demanding on the quality of the laminated steel itself, in terms of internal stresses, surface planarity, surface quality and thickness dispersion on a single sheet. Even thickness tolerances as small as \(\pm\)0.05 mm do not result in perfect stacking. With the stack over 1 m thick we experienced about 2-3 mm differences in the final stack dimensions, because of the way systematics in the lamination build up, for example due to conical shapes. The use of laminated steel of 2 mm and 2.5 mm (used in pairs to simulate 4 and 5 mm thick sheets), initially adopted for the first 2 prototypes, caused severe problems to sufficient mechanical rigidity. Even though more difficult to cut, lamination of 4 and 5 mm thickness have then been preferred. Furthermore compression of the stack required compression rods of very high quality steel. The rigidity of the stack was nevertheless not satisfactory.

Laser cutting and matrix punching have been identified as the best candidate techniques for the manufacturing of master and spacer plates.

On the basis of experience with the first five prototypes and of new structural analysis, an important effort was made to find a more suitable stacking technique.

Three additional prototypes were built with a new concept in which a module is assembled from several \(\sim\) 300 mm thick prefabricated submodules (Fig. 1a). Each submodule is an independent and rigid object bolted to a massive girder at the outer radius; the attachment of masters and spacers within a submodule is achieved by gluing.

The 300 mm thick submodule is assembled starting from glued half-period preassemblies (1 master plate and a set of spacer plates). For each half-period, elastic dowel pins position the spacers precisely on the master plates. A layer of epoxy is applied to the spacer-to-master contact face, then the half-periods are stacked and compressed to 30 cm height with a special tool, while keeping the outer faces parallel. The glue has the role of keeping the stack solid and at the same time compensating for surface planarity defects. The final stack thickness is held to a fixed value by the use of calibrated columns in the pressing tool. The half-periods are precisely positioned relative to each other by means of two key ways placed at the inner and the outer radius. Reference to these keys minimizes tolerance build-up. Once the glue has polymerized, four strips are welded to the submodule corners to provide additional rigidity during handling and for the connection to the girder. For the three new prototypes, variation of the overall submodule thickness was held to 0.2-0.3 mm.

Other geometrical parameters have been optimized. Careful studies have been pursued to optimize the tile geometry, to avoid channeling effects. The optimal configuration is given by scintillator plates of 4 different radial sizes.

The space reserved to route out the fibres from the scintillator to the PMTs was also optimized. The gaps between adjacent modules were minimized by choosing a solution where this gap varies as a function of the radial depth.

### Scintillator Tiles

The main considerations in the choice of scintillating tiles are photoelectron yield, uniformity of response within a tile, tile to tile fluctuations and cost. Due to the large number of tiles foreseen in the ATLAS calorimeter (\(\simeq\) 423 000 of 11 different sizes), an important effort was made to efficiently construct them.

The most promising technique for this application is injection molding, which eliminates operations such as machining to size and polishing edges. Over the last 3 years our efforts have been concentrated on optimizing the performance of injection molded scintillator. Four prototypes modules have been equipped with this scintillator; one module instead has been equipped with commercial cast and polished tiles for comparison. In 1995 two prototypes have been re-instrumented with scintillator produced after all this optimization process has taken place. All injected tiles have been developed and produced in one of the collaborating institutions [5] at a cost of about 1 CHF per tile.

As a basis for the optimization two main aspects have been considered: absolute light yield and light uniformity. Finite photostatistics gives an additional contribution to the calorimeter resolution added in quadrature to the intrinsic resolution. In order that the intrinsic resolution be degraded by \(\leq\)10%, the photoelectron yield must be at least 1 photoelectron per tile per mip [6]. However not only does the scintillator need to put out suffient light, coupling efficiency to the fibres and transmission of the scintillator light to the phototube are also factors. A nonuniformity of tile response will degrade the performance of a calorimeter. Due to the size of hadron showers, degradation in resolution caused by this effect is reduced in hadron calorimeters. If a random tile nonuniformity of \(\sigma-\)10% is introduced, an addition to the constant term can be expected up to about 1 % and up to few % non-linearity in the energy response depending

on where the tile variations occur in the shower. Furthermore, as transverse nonuniformities become comparable to transverse shower sizes, a further degradation in the constant term of the calorimeter resolution might appear.

These features of tile/fibre setups have been extensively studied at various laboratories with \(\beta\) sources; the improvements thus obtained were then thoroughly investigated with high energy muons in test beams.

#### 2.2.1 Tile Manufacture

Commercially available optically transparent granulated polystyrene (with a grain size of about 3 mm) is used as a base. The polystyrene is dried in a furnace and then mixed carefully with the primary and secondary WLS dyes (1.5% of PTP and 0.04% of POPOP). The prepared mixture is loaded into a standard commercially available molding machine, melted and injected into a mold. The mold can be of arbitrary shape, providing the tiles with grooves and holes as required. In general no additional mechanical treatment (e.g. polishing) is needed for the final product. Dimensional tolerance is determined mainly by the stability of the thermal shrinking constant. The safe linear tolerance factor is about 0.04 %. The whole cycle lasts less than two minutes per tile.

Quality control during manufacture consists of recording the DC current from a PMT viewing about 15% of the tiles. The tiles are excited with a \({}^{90}\)Sr source both near the fibre readout end and at the edge opposite to the fibre. The average light yield from the far edge for all 18 tile samples is depicted in Figure 2. Most of the tiles passed the selection criteria that allowed a variation of 10 % in the light yield. Detailed results on tile uniformity and tile to tile fluctuations will be presented in the next sections.

Though scintillators made out of Russian manufactured polystyrene, PSM-115 [7], and WLS dyes PTP + POPOP have adequate light yield, a search was made for better components. Results are presented in Figs. 3a and 3b. It can be seen that PSM-115 polystyrene gives the best results, and that PPO is a good candidate to replace PTP as primary dopant. Wrapped with white paper, tiles were excited with a \({}^{90}\)Sr source along their length in 1 cm steps. The data plotted are in photocurrent from two WLS fibres coupled to both tile edges.

Measurements with a source have shown that in the 1995 production batch the light yield of the scintillator was improved by 20-50% most likely due to a more careful control of raw materials quality and injection regime. The measured effective attenuation length of the 1995 batch was found to be \(\sim\) 50 cm, an increase over the value of \(\sim\) 35 cm for the 1994 batch.

Figure 2: Average light yield for 18 tile samples.

Natural ageing and radiation hardness of scintillator depend on the components used. An important factor is the presence of unpolymerized monomer in the polystyrene. For PSM-115, the specification requires less than 0.1 %, which is a few times less than standard bulk polymerized scintillators. Using artificial ageing methods it has been estimated that this may not cause more than 10 % degradation of the light attenuation length over 10 years [8]. This estimate is comparable to the observed degradation of 1 % per year in CDF. Ten years of experiments at IHEP with this type of scintillator did not show any effective degradation of calorimeter performance.

Plastic scintillator scintillation properties and transparency change under irradiation. These modifications depend essentially on the type of scintillator and have a rather complicated dynamic behaviour due to the processes of destruction and restoration (annealing) of its chemical components. The maximum expected peak dose in the tile calorimeter in ATLAS, including the dose from charged particles and neutron flux, is about 40 kRad in ten years [9] of running at

full luminosity. In order to know the scale of the problem, tiles, fibres and tile/fibre setups have been irradiated.

Some tile/WLS fibres assemblies have been irradiated uniformly using a \({}^{60}\)Co source at the rate of \(\approx 2.5\) kRad/h, with a total dose of \(\approx 370\) kRad, about 10 times the total dose expected in 10 running years of LHC. Irradiated tiles were read out with irradiated and non-irradiated 1.5 m long fibres. For irradiated tiles readout by non-irradiated fibres the light reduction has been found to be less than 5 %.

Similar results were obtained in more systematic irradiations of tiles [11]. Smaller size molded tiles were irradiated uniformly either with \({}^{137}\)Cs sources or low energy hadrons at a rate of few Rad/sec, \(\approx 20\) kRad/h. In Fig. 4a some results on the annealing process are showed. One can observe recovery just after the end of the irradiation, followed by stabilization within one day. The strong recovery in the first day after irradiation is probably due to the very high dose rate. Further studies are under way.

In Fig. 4b the dependence of the light yield on the total dose is presented. These data were taken at 10.7 cm from an unexposed readout fibre one month after irradiation. These data predict a negligible effect on ATLAS tile degradation under irradiation at the expected radiation dose of about 40 kRad in ten years.

These results are consistent with similar radiation damage measurements made for SDC [12]. Polystyrene based SCSN-81 tiles were irradiated with up to about 6 MRad. At 1 MRad the tiles showed about a 35 % loss of light, consistent with our data in Figure 4a. The damage was rather independent of the dose rate. Uniformity across the tile did not change with doses up to 5 MRad, also consistent with the annealed response across our tile as seen in Fig. 4a.

#### 2.2.2 Tile Uniformity

Much progress has been made in understanding the response uniformity across a tile [13]. The tiles of the 1993 prototypes had two air-coupled fibres, placed in grooves at the radial edges of the tiles; the edges were chamfered at \(45^{\circ}\) angle. The tiles were wrapped in white paper with an aluminized mylar reflector covering the fibres. Although sufficient light output was obtained, the transverse uniformity of these tiles was poor. Light output near the fibres increased by \(\simeq 40\) % relative to the signal at the center of the tile, with a sharp rise in the last few mm.

Source scans revealed that removal of the groove and chamfer produced a more uniform response as well as a higher light yield. Figure 5 shows a comparison between the 1993 configu

ration (with molded grooves and chamfers) with the same tile having flat polished edges. These results were independently confirmed for many different tile sizes. Test beam data taken in 1994 utilized both these types of tiles. In 1995 a new batch of scintillator was molded with the new geometry (flat edges) and all further R&D was then based on this new geometry.

As mentioned above the 1995 light yield of the scintillator was improved by 20-50 % over that of 1994 most likely due to a more careful control of raw materials quality, injection regime and to the new geometry. Further efforts focused on the tile wrapping to increase the light yield of the scintillator. It was found that wrapping the surface with Tyvek rather than white bond paper increases the light from the scintillator by about 10 %, while keeping approximately the same tile profile as can be seen in Fig. 6a. In a study on holding the fibre in place, it was also found that Tyvek gives about 5 % more light than an aluminized mylar reflector.

Masking the scintillator tile with black strips is a technique used, for example, by CDF and ZEUS [14], to obtain a more uniform response across the surface of the tile. In this technique,

The light output increases by about 10 % but the profile is the same. b) A comparison of the total light yield of an unmasked injection molded tile of size 10 with the same tile having a 33 mm black Tedlar mask at the edges of the readout sides. The response uniformity after masking is 2.5 %.

a final improvement to the uniformity consists in masking the surface of the tile near the fibre with black Tedlar strips. We find that the masking diminishes the sharp rise in light yield near the fibres, with acceptable loss in the total light output. The Tedlar strips size was chosen to cover the region starting where the light output is the same as in the center of the tile and the end of the tile: a too small strip did not effectively kill the sharp rise while a too wide strip decreased the light output at the edges significantly. To reduce labour, six widths of strips were chosen for six groups of three consecutively sized tiles in each group: 7, 17, 25, 33, 42 and 50 mm. Figure 6b shows a comparison between a tile properly masked and that of a tile simply wrapped. The RMS of the unmasked distribution across the tile width is reduced from 3.7 % to 2.5 % with a 33 mm mask.

Simulation of the process of light collection in the tiles is under way in several institutes, in order to optimize the tile uniformity choosing the best masking for each tile size. A plot comparing simulation and experimental data is shown in Fig. 7.

With the improvements in the scintillator quality and the improvements in wrapping, the required 1 photoelectron/mip/tile has been achieved. Such an absolute measurement has been done in the laboratory using a \({}^{106}\)Ru source scanner [13]. In the subsequent sections it will be shown that further light yield improvements have been achieved using better fibers. A source scan across the surface of one of the modified/masked tiles is shown in Figure 8. Within this area, the source holes represent maximal nonuniformity over only 2% of the tile surface and

Evident in the plot are the holes in the tile and the two regions where the material was injected into the mold.

should therefore be well absorbed into the average response of the calorimeter. In general we find that source scans yield a 2-3% uniformity across the width of any given tile properly masked, and the uniformity across the surface of such a tile has an RMS of \(\sim\) 5-6%.

### The WLS Fibres

WLS fibres of 1 mm diameter with a decay time of the order of 10 ns are used to read out the scintillating tiles. The blue light of the scintillator is absorbed by the WLS fibres, shifted to the green and then transmitted along the fibres to the PMTs. To get the maximum light along the useful lifetime of the calorimeter, the WLS fibres have been designed to have the following properties:

* the absorption spectrum of the fibre should match the emission spectrum of the scintillator and the emission spectrum of the fibre should match the quantum efficiency of the photomultiplier;
* the fibres should have maximal light yield and attenuation length;
* the fibres should be flexible enough for the stress due to the curvature on the paths in the calorimeter, not to affect light collection;
* the direct fibre response to ionizing particles should be small in order to avoid large signals in the crack between modules;
* they should be radiation hard;
* natural ageing over 10 years should be negligible.

The fibre ends opposite to the PMTs are aluminized by sputtering, which gives a reflectivity of \(\sim\) 85%. Attenuation lengths for aluminized fibres are around 4 m.

The final choice of the fibres is yet to be made. Three companies produce to day WLS fibres; several improvement have been made over the last two years, as we have been working in close contact with these producers. Bicron (fibre BCF91A) and Kuraray (fibre Y11(200)MS) now make available products, while Pol.Hi.Tech. (fibre S048) is rapidly improving (see Fig. 9a).

Sample fibres from all these companies have been investigated in a comparative way, for varying the dopant concentration, UV absorber concentration, cladding type, mechanical stress, splicing technique and radiation hardness [15, 16]. Fibres are excited at different distances from the PMT using light from an injected molded scintillator. The light yield (PMT current) is measured for several distances along the fibres and then normalized to the number of produced photoelectrons, obtained with a measurement (Ref. [16]). The results are typically fitted with a single exponential, using only points with a distance to the PMT of at least 50 cm. To calculate the attenuation lengths the same data are fitted with a sum of two exponentials. Values of light yield and attenuation length for typical fibres are shown in table 1. Attenuation curves for some of them are shown in Fig. 9a, and others are plotted, normalized to BCF91A, in Fig. 9b.

Multiclad fibres (produced now by 2 of the 3 companies) were shown to improve the light yield by a factor of the order of 1.2-1.4 when compared to single clad fibres of the same type. The 1 mm double clad fibres from Kuraray for example consists of a fibre core 0.896 mm in diameter (index of reflection \(n=1.59\)), an inner cladding 0.030 mm thick (\(n=1.49\)) and an outer cladding 0.022 mm thick (\(n=1.42\)).

Another possibility to increase the light yield of fibres is to increase the dopant concentration. This parameter has been studied for several types of fibres, BCF91A type from Bicron (with the designation BCF99), S048 from Pol.Hi.Tech and several fibre types from Kuraray. Details are presented in references [15, 16]. It has been noticed that an increase in the dopant concentration does not necessarily lead to an increase in light output at all distances along the fibre, even though the initial light yield at x=0 increases with increasing dopant. This effect is simply due to the balance between light yield that increases with dopant concentration and attenuation length that decreases. In the range of concentrations tested, for BCF91A and Y11 fibres, the changes in light yield and attenuation length are very small. Pol.Hi.Tech tried a bigger range, and in addition to other factors succeeded in increasing the light output by increasing the dopant concentration [16].

One important characteristic of WLS fibres is the decay time [16]. A summary of measurements done in the laboratory for the types of fibres we are considering is shown in table 2, where it is seen that the decay time for all samples are below 6 ns. In the case of S048 fibres from Pol.Hi.Tech, the doping with UVA introduces a longer component of 8.7 ns which dominates the time spectrum. The same effect should be present for Bicron and Kuraray fibres doped with UVA absorber; further measurements are needed.

#### 2.3.1 Effect of the UV Absorber Concentration

It has been observed in the test beam that polystyrene based WLS fibres produce light when excited by ionizing particles. This light could be Cerenkov light produced inside the fibres and subsequently shifted to the green emission spectrum or similarly shifted scintillation light coming from the polystyrene base. To reduce the direct response to ionizing radiation, fibres with UV absorber added have been produced and tested. The UV absorber is expected to suppress a big fraction of the light produced in the fibres, while keeping the same transmission for green light. To study the direct light output produced by charged particles, the scintillator used to illuminate the fibres was removed from the setup and the fibres have been excited directly with electrons from a \({}^{90}\)Sr \(\beta\)-source.

The attenuation length was found to decrease when the concentration of absorber (UVA) increases. As an example the attenuation length for Bicron fibres goes from 227 cm to 88 cm with the addition of 2.0% of UVA [15]. For light produced at a distance of 140 cm from the PMT the best scintillator/direct response ratio, while keeping the scintillator response (maximum light loss of the order of 5%), is obtained with Y11(200)MS fibres with UVA concentration in the range 300-1000 ppm. Y11(200)MS fibres with 600 ppm of UVA were used to equip two prototype modules in 1995.

#### 2.3.2 Ageing Properties and Radiation Resistance

A decrease of the attenuation length due to micro cracks on the surface for fibres under stress is one of the features of ageing. One way to produce cracks is to mechanically bend the fibres to different radii.

Fibres were bent with diameters of 5, 7.5, 10, 15, 20 cm and kept in position for 100 hours. After this time period the light output was again measured, once the fibres have been straightened. The light output for one of the WLS fibres at a distance of 40 cm from the PMT after stress is shown in Table 3. These results show that Bicron fibres can be bent without damage up to very small radii; this holds for Kuraray 'S' type fibres as well [15]. Some of the Pol.Hi.Tech

Figure 9: a) Attenuation curves for typical fibres. The new BCF91A double clad fibre is compared with the single clad of the same type and with Y11(200)MS from Kuraray. PMT is Hamamatsu R1635-02. b) Light output for some typical fibres normalized to BCF91A for each distance (PMT is EMI 9813KB).

fibres show also promising mechanical stress properties [16]; an R &D program to further improve this is under way. Monitoring of the damage with time is in progress; the first results for the higher quality Pol.Hi.Tech. fibre show a light output decrease of 5 % after two months of stress on a 50 mm diameter disk.

Radiation hardness studies have been extended to the fibres, using a \({}^{60}\)Co source. In order to reproduce as much as possible the radial dependence of the dose rate in ATLAS (and also because it was available), the dose profile was the following: 'zero' dose in the first 50 cm, followed by an almost uniform dose of 110 kRad (dose rates of \(\approx\) 0.5 and 4 kRad/h) or 300 kRad (dose rate of \(\approx\) 2 kRad/h) along 1 m. This of course overestimates the expected integrated dose along the fibre, which decreases logarithmically as a function of calorimeter (fibre) depth.

Results are shown in Fig. 10. It can be seen that Bicron BCF91A type fibres and Kuraray Y11(200)MS experience a similar light loss. The S048 fibres that have been tested are not radiation hard, but the type containing UV absorber showed to be more radiation hard than the type N4 (which has a better light yield). Pol.Hi.Tech. radiation hard fibres will be tested in the near future. The addition of 1000 ppm of UV absorber in the Kuraray fibres practically does not change their radiation hardness. Bicron fibres display some extra degradation when 600 ppm of UVA is added.

The light reduction in the fibres is the major contribution to the global light reduction on the tile/fibre assemblies due to the non-realistic fibre dose profile applied. A light reduction of the

\end{table}
Table 3: Variation of light output with curvature diameter \(D\) for one type of fibres (BCF-99-28A). \(\mathcal{L}_{40}\) is the relative light output at a distance of 40 cm from the PMT.

order of 15 % is observed for a dose of the order of 300 kRad. From these results one expects for ten years of LHC equivalent dose a signal loss at the inner radius region of the tile calorimeter of about 5 % [10]. In order to evaluate the effects of the radiation on the jet calorimeter response, a simulation study has been performed. The main conclusion is that the effect of radiation on the jet energy resolution is marginal (\(\Delta\sigma_{E}/E=0.24\) % at \(\eta=1.5\)), as well as in the total light reduction (about 2 % at \(\eta=1.5\)).

#### 2.3.3 Spliced Fibres

One drastic way to get a more uniform fibre layout and a better light yield is to use WLS fibres with the same length coupled to clear fibres. In this case a very short WLS fibre is used to collect the light from the scintillator tiles and is spliced to a clear fibre that transports the light to the PMT, taking advantage of its larger attenuation length (about 15 m).

This splicing technique has already been adopted for the hadronic calorimeter of the CDF experiment at Fermilab [17].

Some fibres spliced in one of the collaborating institutions have been mounted on the existing prototypes and tested in the beam. The attenuation curves show the presence of two components of light, having \(\sim 20\) cm and \(\sim 300\) cm of attenuation length respectively. The presence of the first component may compromise the effective attenuation length, and thus jeopardize the advantage of the spliced fibres.

Studies are under way to clarify the advantages and disadvantages of the splicing technique for the case of Tile calorimeter; the additional cost and implications will need careful consideration.

### Source Intercalibration System

The tile calorimeter design allows a radioactive source to be passed through every scintillator tile, in order to first equalize the response of each readout cell and then to monitor in time. The mechanical concept is illustrated in Fig. 11: every scintillating tile is traversed by a hollow tube, into which a gamma source (\({}^{137}\)Cs, \(E_{\gamma}=0.662\) MeV) is inserted. As the source moves along the tube it consecutively excites every tile; the current in the corresponding PMT is proportional to its gain and to the overall calorimeter photoelectron yield. The range of 0.662 MeV photons in iron is of the order of the distance between tiles; due to this circumstance the response of each individual tile is seen as a peak in the PMT current as the source passes through it. This provides a useful quality check of the assembly of a calorimeter module.

An automated calibration system, including a remote-controlled source driving machine, the PMT readout electronics, the DAQ and online analysis software was built in 1994 and used on the calorimeter modules herein described. The system allowed scanning of all readout cells of the 5-module prototype in a few hours. In this setup a 5 mCi \({}^{137}\)Cs source, mounted within a thin steel tube, is moved through a system of tubes reaching every tile. PMT signals are integrated

Figure 11: Mechanical concept of the source calibration system

(using simple op-amp based circuits) over 20 msec to average out statistical fluctuations; the output voltages are proportional to the time-averaged PMT currents. With a typical PMT gain of about 10\({}^{6}\) the 1994 prototype modules give currents of about 250 nA. The digitized voltages are used to calculate online the response of each cell, averaging over all tiles and using about 6 measurements/tile. Equalization of the response is simply achieved by adjusting the PMT HV to obtain the same average signals for each cell. These average values are measured again at later times as a check of response stability.

The results obtained with this system in 1994 and 1995 are presented in the calibration chapter. More R&D is in progress to test two new concepts for scanning the ATLAS calorimeter with a radioactive source when the beams are down without requiring access to the detector. The concepts, based on a liquid and a pneumatic drive respectively, would allow faster scans. Such a prototypes will be tested in the near future.

### Laser Monitoring System

A monitoring system based on a solid-state laser has been implemented for tracking PMT gain drifts. This system sends to each PMT light pulses similar in duration, intensity and wavelength to those produced in the scintillator by particles. This is done for several purposes: detection of failures or abnormal behaviours, measurement and correction of the natural fluctuations of the PMT gains, determination and compensation of possible non-linearities of the PMTs.

The first innovation has been the use of a YLF Spectra-Physics laser; this solution offers the advantage of an electronic control of the pulse intensity, which make it possible to produce a series of pulses covering the whole dynamic range of the ADC system. The light emitted by the laser is measured by a set of photodiodes, placed in a temperature controlled box. In order to monitor the stability of the photodiodes and the associated electronics, \({}^{241}\)Am sources are used. The whole set-up, including moving of the polarizers and shutters, is entirely computer controlled via VME. Tests of the complete system started in 1994. The accuracy and the reliability of the system was found to be better than 0.5 %. Recently a charge injection system on the photodiodes was added, to measure and correct their eventual drifts. All system functions have been tested with success during the 1995 test beam period.

Over 12 days of running, a typical 2 % instability of the PMT gain has been observed over 200 PMTs (Fig. 12a). Using the laser information and applying run by run corrections, the stability of the calorimeter has been controlled to the level of 0.2 % over the 12 days. The spread of the laser signal due to photodstatistics allowed also to determine the number of photoelectrons on each PMT. Results are in full agreement with those obtained with muons and electrons (see muon chapter). An example of the quality of the linearity measurement as a function of ADC counts for one PMT is illustrate in Fig. 12b). In the range covered by the laser at this stage the system is linear at the level of 1 %, with some systematic deviations at the two extremes.

This monitoring system has reached its final design and is ready to be rescaled to the ATLAS requirement.

## 3 Readout Electronics

While for the test of the five Tile calorimeter prototypes, standard electronics components and existing readout devices have been used (XP2012 bialkali photomultipliers, CAEN 2208 ADCs, CAEN 4014 HV power supplies), intense R&D has been carried out in several domains of electronics and light detectors. For most components, prototypes have been built and tested using the beam. A short summary of this work is given below.

### Light Detectors

The requirements on this device mostly derive from the ATLAS detector demands:* a good signal/noise ratio;
* a rise time of \(\approx\) 3 ns;
* an active detection area of about 17 mm in diameter (2/3"). This number is determined by taking into account the number of bunched fibres per cell (between 20 and 150), the edge efficiency of squared light mixers and the mechanical tolerance on the relative bundle to mixer positioning (\(\pm\)1.5 mm).
* the need to shield the light detector against stray magnetic fields up to 500 Gauss in any direction;
* a compact mechanical arrangement, allowing easy access to the whole readout;
* radiation hardness, mainly with respect to fast neutrons.

Two options have been considered: avalanche photodiode des (APDs) and photomultiplier tubes (PMTs).

#### 3.1.1 Avalanche Photodiodes

Avalanche photodiodes satisfy in principle some of the requirements, such as a very good quantum efficiency, compactness and insensitivity to magnetic fields. Low noise can be achieved by optimization of intrinsic gain and quantum efficiency and by an appropriate choice of current preamplifiers. Studies have been performed within the RD1 collaboration framework and later continued within RD34 using new commercially available low-noise devices with a sensitive area of 17 mm diameter (Advanced Photonics TL15CA1 13-20-4) [18]. Intensive studies have been performed on a dedicated test bench in order to characterize this product, and in test beams at CERN as readout devices of the RD1 lead/scintillating fibre em prototype. The test bench

Figure 12: a) Stability of individual PMT gains during 12 days of running for the central module (PMT 80 to 120) b) linearity of the response for laser pulses for one PMT (ADC counts)

studies confirm that APDs can work over a rather large range of gains, up to about 600 at 2.2 kV. They also keep linearity over a wide range, up to 10\({}^{8}\). The true limitation are given by the preamplifier, and by a low reverse current, below 0.3 \(\mu A\) at maximum gain. The dependence of the gain variation on temperature and on the applied polarization is of 3 %/degree and 1%/V respectively. Thus a standard high voltage stabilization, similar to the one used for PMTs, would be sufficient, but the temperature dependence would remain the critical issue. The problem is enhanced by the fact that many readout cells are involved in a hadronic shower. Of course, only by tracing the temperature with time, the required corrections may be obtained. For instance, an accuracy of 0.1 degrees on the temperature measurement of each individual APD would give a contribution to the constant term in the energy resolution of about 1.5 % for a hadronic shower spanned over 10 cells.

For those APDs, the response uniformity was measured to be 0.8 % over the whole active detection area, so that a light mixer would be superfluous. A full, integrated design of APD, current preamplifier and shaper has been studied, representing a very good compactness. It was also shown that high energy particles or secondary particles coming from not fully contained showers do not affect the intrinsic properties, like reverse bias current and pulse shape. The intercalibration through a Cesium source is not well suited for APDs, and another method would have to be found. The major problem is their sensitivity to fast neutrons. Using a 14 MeV neutron generator, these APDs were destroyed by 3\(\times\)10\({}^{10}\) neutrons, producing micro-holes. Improvements could be reached by increasing the silicon thickness and decreasing the reverse polarization. New products are now available but the active area does not match today the Tile calorimeter specifications. For all these reasons, the RD34 collaboration has preferred to consider new PMT developments.

#### 3.1.2 Photomultipliers

All five RD34 prototype modules have been tested using Philips XP2012 PMTs already used by the UA2 experiment. About 400 PMTs have been characterized from measurements of gain and dark current as a function of high voltage. Many other types of new PMTs were tested and compared: classical ones with a linear dynode structure (Philips and Hamamatsu 3/4"), and PMTs following a new technology, "the metal channel dynode with a metal package" from Hamamatsu. Their characteristics are the closest ones to the required specifications, including compactness and low sensitivity to magnetic field. Studies have been performed first on R5600 models, with a round shape, later on the square shaped R5900 models, which have an active area of 18 \(\times\)18 mm\({}^{2}\). This new device is a follow-up of the R5600 model, developed by Hamamatsu especially for ATLAS applications. It matches perfectly the optimum squared shape of the light mixer with following additional advantages:

* a nominal gain of 10\({}^{6}\) for a 10-stage dynode structure at a rather low nominal high voltage setting of about 800 V;
* the small size, a compact \(25\times 25\times 20\) mm\({}^{3}\) parallelepiped;
* a fast rise time and a transit time of a fewns;
* low dark currents (1 nA or less at the nominal gain), which is very important for the Cesium source calibrations.

Two generation of prototypes and about 12 individual PMTs have been tested and qualified in close interaction with the producer. Up to now several of the desired performances have been achieved: quantum efficiency of about 17% at 480 nm (close to the design value), fast and clean pulse shape, fibre-to fibre response (once an appropriate light mixer is placed in front of the PMT) uniformity at the level of few %), linearity as a function of the anode current, from both the optimizations of HV dividers and light mixers, insensitivity to the magnetic fields up to 200 Gauss in any direction with individual shielding and insensitivity to fast neutrons.

Figure 13 shows gain and dark current dependences of a typical HV setting for R5900 PMT. The next development stage (September 1995) will concern a further improvement of uniformity and quantum efficiency. At the same time, long term stability and ageing studies will start.

#### 3.1.3 Charge Collection Time from Scope Data

The charge collection curve for the tile calorimeter has been measured by means of a digital storage oscilloscope (DSO: TEK TDS 520, 500 MHz bandwidth and 500 MSa/s sampling rate). With an active adder, the signals of the 40 photomultipliers of the central prototype module have been combined and led to the oscilloscope. A typical pulse for a 100 GeV pion is shown Figure 14a.

The first method to obtain the charge collection curve of the calorimeter is to integrate

Figure 14: a) A typical pulse given by a 100 GeV pion. The sampling period is 2 ns. b) Time required for collecting 90 % of the charge for pions at 100 GeV.

numerically each digitized signal and then to find the time required for a collection of 90 % of the charge. Figure 14b shows such a distribution for 100 GeV pions.

This method suffers from the sampling period of the DSO. Because the calorimeter pulses are rather fast, the 2 ns time resolution available for pulse digitization is not sufficient to fully characterize the pulse. A second method to obtain the charge collection curve has been investigated: first, the pulses have been linearly interpolated and the resulting signals have been fed into a low pass digital filter that reaches maximum flatness in the passing band. This filter has the cutoff frequency set to 125 MHz, in order to cope with the original sampling rate of the DSO. The net effect of this filter is to preserve the original frequency contents of the acquired pulse while a finer time resolution is achieved. After interpolation the pulses are aligned in time using their derivative. Fig. 15 shows a) the average pulse for 100 GeV pionsand b) the resulting charge curve. Table 4 shows the time required for the charge collection of 50 and 100 GeV pions for different charge fractions.

### R&D on Electronic Components

Guided by the need to minimize space and cost, the general electronics design and development has been expressed around the mechanical concept of drawers. A drawer is a mechanical structure, inserted into the support part of the calorimeter (see Fig. 16a), which hosts the readout

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|} \hline \hline

devices and all the associated readout electronics, including the digitizing part. It also allows easy access to all readout parts of the system, keeping as much as possible on the detector itself. Figure 16a illustrates this mechanical concept. Based on this idea, R&D and prototyping work of most of the components has started. For some of the components, tests with beam have already been performed.

Figure 16b shows the basic readout unit, the PMT block. It consists of a metal shielding (soft iron + \(\mu\)-metal) which hosts PMT, light mixer and the readout electronics in a space very close to the photomultiplier to minimize the electronic noise and the space needed. The electronic elements are: the HV divider, the dynamic range compressor, the shaper, the current integrator, the calibration system and all control functions. A fast pulse shaping circuit is used to match the phototube signal to the digitizing electronics. The output pulse will have a peaking time of 35 ns to ensure three samples of the waveform, as required for subsequent extraction of the signal amplitude and time. Shaper prototypes have been constructed and tested with beams carried out in 1994 and 1995. The noise level reached was 500 and 200 \(\mu\)V respectively. This last value corresponds to an equivalent energy of 13 MeV per cell. The complete PMT chain, shaper, compressor and digital processor (RD16-FERMI, 10 bit ADC, 40MHz) has been tested on few tile calorimeter readout channels in '94 with particles. A direct comparison of signals, readout for the same channels also with standard electronics, has shown agreement at the level of 0.5 %. In 1995 the central prototype module has been fully equipped with both readout systems by using active splitters (40 channels). The analysis of such data is still in progress.

R&D work has also been done in the field of HV supply. To enable individual adjustment of the PMT gains, while maintaining a reasonable cost for power supplies, the high-voltage power can be organized in two stages. First, a general HV power supply provides a single voltage for a set of PMTs (for example all PMTs contained in two drawers), then the controllers, using optocouplers, distribute individual voltages to each PMT. Typically in the case of R5900 Hamamatsu PMTs, the external HV power supplies will have to provide about 10 mA at 1 kV. The optocontrollers will then allow a voltage adjustment over a range of 350 V. HV source

Figure 16: a)Layout of a Drawer inside the calorimeter support structure, which accommodates all readout electronics and PMTs b) A PMT block

prototypes have been constructed for this application. The tested HV system supplies three different voltages (1.1, 0.9 and 0.7 kV). Good performance figures have been achieved on the prototype; for example the output ripple at 18 mA is lower than 15 mV. Two 24-channels HV distribution boards, controlled by a 68332 MC processor have also been built and tested. The resulting HV stabilization is better than 0.5 V. The linearity of the applied HV versus the setting value is good over about 350 V. Ageing and reliability tests are in progress.

## 4 Test Beam Layouts

Two different setups have been used to test the five prototype modules at the CERN-SPS.

In the standalone mode the five modules have been positioned on a scanning table, able to allow high precision movements along any direction. Beam chambers and beam defining elements have been placed just in front of the scanning table. A large scintillator wall covering about 1 \(m^{2}\) of surface has been placed on the side and on the back of the calorimeter to quantify back and side leakage.

For the combined run the setup has been different. The Tile calorimeter has been placed on a fixed table, just behind the LAr Accordion cryostat. Both the cryostat and the tile calorimeter have been tilted with respect to the beam axis by 11.3\({}^{\circ}\) to ensure full containment at least in the electromagnetic part.

For the em section the large 2 m prototype [4] of RD3 has been used, located close to the back of the cryostat to reduce the distance between the two active devices. In front of the Accordion, inside the cryostat, in the liquid, a tube of extruded material has been placed to minimize as far as possible the amount of interactions in front of the em calorimeter.

For this layout the effective distance between the two devices is of the order of 45 cm, instead of the 25 cm as foreseen in the ATLAS setup. The amount of material has been quantified to be about 2\(X_{o}\) in between the two calorimeters. This value is similar to the ATLAS design value, but the material type is different: steel instead of aluminum for the cryostat.

The 2 m electromagnetic calorimeter prototype consists of a stack of three azimuthal modules covering 27\({}^{\circ}\) in \(\phi\). The segmentation is \(\Delta\eta\times\Delta\phi\simeq 0.018\times 0.02\) for the first two compartments (9 \(X_{o}\) in depth each) and \(\Delta\eta\simeq 0.036\) in the last one (7 \(X_{o}\)). The calorimeter, constructed with

Figure 17: test beam setup for the combined LAr and tile calorimeter combined run

a fully projective geometry, is equipped with different types of preamplifiers (Si, GaAs and 0T), followed by shaping amplifiers (\(t_{p}(\delta)\simeq 20\) ns), Track&Hold circuits, and 12-bit ADCs.

For this run, in the em section, only a matrix of \(11\times 11\) cells has been equipped with electronics and fully read out, for a total surface of about \(25\) cm\(\times 25\) cm, limiting this way the transversal containment of the hadronic showers.

Beam elements and beam chambers in front of the cryostat are used to define the beam and its quality. The energy of the beam (pions, electrons and muons) has been varied from 20 to 300 GeV.

## 5 The Calibration Procedures

### Cs Source

The Cs source system, previously described, allows to measure the photocurrent induced in a PMT as a \({}^{137}\)Cs source moves across a cell. A typical curve of the measured current as a function of the source position across five cells is shown in Fig. 18 for five of the readout PMTs.

Five excitation curves, corresponding to the five readout cells, are superimposed. Each curve shows a multiple peak/valley structure: each peak corresponds to the passage of the source across an individual scintillator tile. The integral of the current curve, after baseline subtraction, provides a constant proportional to the gain of the corresponding PMT: such a constant is used to intercalibrate the cells.

#### 5.1.1 Gain Setting Procedure and Calibration

The first step of the calorimeter calibration is the adjustment of the 200 phototube gains. Therefore the second tile in each radial segment (sampling) is scanned with the Cs source system providing the integral of the current measured by the 10 corresponding PMTs. The scan is repeated until a good uniformity is achieved. This procedure allows to adjust the current integrals for the 200 PMTs to better than 2 %. Typically this is achieved in 2-3 iterations.

The second step of the calibration consists in a scan of all 18 tiles of a module1. The

Figure 18: Current measurement after pedestal subtraction for the five PMTs on one tile side as a function of the source position.

calibration constant for a PMT can be found averaging the measurements of all tiles in a given sampling, excluding the last tile in each sampling (see section 5.3).

Systematic effects in the evaluation of the integral of the current in a cell have been studied by varying the algorithm. Variations are smaller than 1.0 %. The reproducibility of the measurements obtained with the Cs source has been studied by comparing the ratios of gains for two cells of a radial segment measured at different times, hence cancelling the differences that could be introduced by effects of different light yield for different tile sizes and different fibre lengths. The precision on a single measurement turned out to be better than 0.5 %. More details about these studies can be found in [19].

#### 5.1.2 Stability of the Calorimeter Calibration

The Cs source system is also used for the long-term monitoring of the calorimeter calibration. During the three '95 test beam periods, several partial or complete calibration scans have been performed before and after the runs and, weekly, during the 8 hours shutdown periods of the SPS. Fig. 19 shows typical time evolution of the signals measured with the Cs movable source for three PMTs of the central module during 2 running periods: two weeks in May and two weeks in July. The distribution of the measured integrals taken at different time for the central module from May to July has an average of 1.3 % and a rms of 0.5 %.

#### 5.1.3 Checking the Calibration of the Calorimeter with Pion Data

In order to cross-check that the calorimeter has been correctly calibrated with the Cs source, data of 180 GeV pions, impinging at \(\Theta\ =\ 0.2^{\circ}\) and covering about 70 cm of the front face of the calorimeter have been analyzed. A substantial amount of energy is deposited in all the cells of the module and it is possible to calculate the ratio \((L-R)/(L+R)\) for the two PMTs connected to each cell, where L and R designate the signals in the two (Left and Right) PMTs. Fig. 20 shows the \((L-R)/(L+R)\) distribution for the 20 cells. The distribution has an rms of 1.6 % and shows no tails. Hence, the calibration of an individual PMT is good to \(1.6/\sqrt{2}\) = 1.1 %, giving an independent cross-check on the performance of the Cs calibration. As a cross-check

data impinging at \(\Theta\ =\ 90^{\circ}\) in the center of tile \(2,5,10\) and \(15\) of the central module have also been analyzed and the result is consistent.

#### 5.1.4 Tile/Fibre Fluctuations

As seen in Fig. 18, the Cs source probes the details of the calorimeter structure and in particular the individual tile response and fibre response and the effects of the tile-fibre coupling.

Using the ratio of left and right PMTs measurements, the tile fluctuations will cancel out and only the fluctuations in the fibre-to-fibre response and in the tile-fibre coupling will contribute to the width of the distribution (for more details on the method see [19]). Fig. 21a shows such a distribution which has a sigma of \(6.0\) %. Then the contribution of left or right is \(6.0/\sqrt{2}=4.2\) %. This result has been obtained for the new optimized tile geometry with fibres coupled to tiles without grooves.

The distribution of the response of individual tiles, seen by one PMT, is shown in Fig. 21b. The fluctuations, in this case, are due to both tile and fibre fluctuations. Subtracting quadratically the latter from the total sigma of \(6.7\) %, the value for rms of the tile-to-tile fluctuations and the effect of different fibre lengths is \(5.2\) %.

### Calibration with Muons

The calorimeter has been exposed to high energy muons impinging at \(90^{\circ}\) in the geometrical center of the \(18\) tiles. This provides an alternative technique to intercalibrate the calorimeter cells.

The energy spectra are fitted to a Moyal function [20] which, compared to a pure Landau, allows to take into account resolution effects but does not reproduce well the high energy tails. The truncated mean method (removing the top \(35\) % of the events) was also applied to the data. The comparison between the Moyal fit and the truncated mean method shows a difference with an rms of about \(1\) %.

The muon signals in the calorimeter are small and the precision could be limited because of the effects of the noise and the resolution of the ADCs. A second set of muon data has been recorded later, inserting external amplifiers (gain=10) in the electronic chain. The disagreement between the two muon data sets using the truncated mean method is at the level of \(2.8\) % and using the Moyal fit is \(3\) %. This can be taken as an estimate of the precision of the measurements with muon data.

### Comparison of Cs and Muon Signals for the 18 Rows of Tiles

For each tile size (1-18), the signals given by the corresponding 10 PMTs are averaged. The observed patterns across the 18 tiles obtained with source and with muons are shown in Fig. 22 for '95 data.

Looking at the muon response in the last two radial segments, a decrease as a function of the tile number can be observed. The effect is due to the decrease of the light yield at the center of a tile as the tile gets wider and the distance between the light production point and the fibre gets larger. It is possible to see that the tiles having even numbers tend to give slightly more light than tiles having odd numbers. This is a consequence of the fact that they are connected to different sets of fibres of slightly different length (see Ref. [19]).

The Cs data follow a similar pattern except for the last tile in each sampling where, due to the range in iron of the \({}^{137}\)Cs 662 keV photons, only 78 % of the energy is deposited in the cell read out. When trying to correlate Cs with muons, the fact that the Cs source deposits energy across 2 tiles has to be taken into account. In such a way it is possible to calculate the ratio

Figure 21: a) Ratio of the unfolded maxima of the current spectrum of the left PMT over the right PMT for all the cells of the central module. b) Dispersion of the values of the unfolded maxima of the current spectra for all readout cells of the central module.

Figure 22: Comparison between the Cs and the muon data for the central module. Each point is the average of the signals from the 10 PMTs corresponding to this tile. The muon data are normalized to their mean value, while the Cs data are normalized to their mean value after removing the last point of each sampling (since in that case only the 78 % of the energy is deposited in the tile).

of the Cs signal over Cs signal reconstructed from the muon signal. The latter is calculated via the formula:

\[Cs_{i}=0.78\cdot\mu_{i}+0.22\cdot\mu_{i+1}\]

where \(i\) is the tile number, within a given sampling. The results are shown in Fig. 23 for '95 data. In this ratio, the effects responsible of the pattern cancel to the first order. The dispersion is 1.6 %.

A comparison of two sets of muon data taken at different run periods show a very similar behaviour despite the fact that for one set the muon beam was not always centered in the middle of a tile.

### Comparison of Cs and Muon Signals for Individual PMT

For a given tile size, the Cs signal over muon signal ratio, taking into account the tile mixing factor, is studied as a function of the PMT number. Fig. 24 presents the result for '94 data for the 4 samplings of the central module. Each individual distribution shows a large dispersion.

The pattern clearly repeats from one tile to another within the sampling. The three central modules show the same type of behaviour. The resulting dispersion on the Cs/muon correlation for an individual PMT is 6 % which is compatible with the dispersion of the average as calculated for the '94 data. For the '95 data this value is 5.3 %. This does not result from miscalibrations in the Cs or in the muon chain. Systematic checks have been performed: ADCs, Cs electronic modules and cables have been interchanged. The pattern is insensitive to any of these modifications. A possible explanation, under investigation, is the non-linearity of the response of the PMTs on the large range of induced currents: the muon gives a small signal while the Cs signal is comparatively very large. The study done with pions showed that the Cs calibration (see section 5.1.3), checked on cells with relatively large energy deposit, is correct to 1.3 %. The same study showed that for very low energy deposit, differences between L and R PMTs appear, at the level of a few %, giving indications of non-linearity of the PMTs. Possible deviations from linearity over the full dynamical range of the PMTs are being investigated using the laser system.

### Requirements on Cell Intercalibration Precision

A study of the effect of various degrees of miscalibration on the pion response has been performed both on data and Monte Carlo events. The systematic effects introduced on the fitted mean is

Figure 23: Ratio of Cs signal over Cs signal reconstructed using muon data. The signal is averaged over the 10 PMTs corresponding to a given tile size. Cs reconstructed = \(0.78\cdot\mu_{i}+0.22\cdot\mu_{i+1}\). The dispersion is 1.6 %.

typically of the order of 30 % of the level of miscalibration, that is a miscalibration of the PMTs at the level of 7 % results in a 2 % possible shift of the mean. This would contribute 2 % to the fractional resolution constant term of the overall calorimeter. In ATLAS, due to the presence of the LAr em calorimeter in front and to fact that we measure jets, such a contribution to the constant term would arise from a 15-20 % intercalibration error. In conclusion, the level of the calibration obtained with the Cs source allows a full realization of the intrinsic capabilities of the Tile calorimeter.

## 6 Pion Response: Standalone Test

The standalone Tile calorimeter prototype has been exposed to high energy pion beams at the CERN SPS. The energy resolution has been studied in the energy range 20 to 300 GeV and at an angle of incidence in \(\Theta\) from 0\({}^{\circ}\) to 30\({}^{\circ}\). Uniformity of response in \(\phi\) and \(Z\) has also been studied. A first set of results have been already presented ([3]) and will not be repeated here.

### Results from Energy Scan at \(\Theta=20^{\circ},30^{\circ}\)

The energy spectra are directly obtained from the raw data, just adding the charge measured in each cell. They are symmetrical low energies and develop small high energy tail at high energies (due to \(e/h>1\)) as well as small low energy tail due to longitudinal and transversal leakage (see section 6.4). Peak and \(\sigma\) values are obtained from the raw energy spectra by Gaussian fits over a \(\pm 2\sigma\) range. Fig. 25 shows the resulting \(\sigma/E\) as a function of \(1/\sqrt{E}\) for the 1995 data at \(\Theta=20^{\circ}\) and \(\Theta=30^{\circ}\).

Figure 24: Ratio of Cs over Cs reconstructed using muon data for individual PMT. The 4 plots correspond to the 4 samplings. For each sampling, the result for each tile size is superimposed.

The data at \(\Theta=20^{\circ}\) and \(\Theta=30^{\circ}\) show similar resolutions. At \(\Theta=30^{\circ}\), the data show some indication of lateral leakage at 300 GeV. In Fig. 25, the resolutions obtained in 1993 ([3]) at \(\Theta=20^{\circ}\) are also shown; the 1993 and 1995 results are seen to be in close agreement.

An iron-scintillator calorimeter is non-compensating, \((e/h>1)\). This causes non-linearity in the pion response. Since the fraction of electromagnetic energy in the shower increases logarithmically with energy, the relative response to pions is expected to increase with energy: the non-linearity is proportional to \((e/\pi)^{-1}\). Fig. 26 shows the pion response at \(20^{\circ}\) fitted to \(\mbox{const}\cdot(1+(e/h-1)\cdot 0.11\cdot\ln E)\) ([21]). The value of \(e/h\) of 1.36 is consistent with the value obtained fitting the \((e/\pi)^{-1}\) ratio at \(20^{\circ}\) ([3]).

It has been shown that the energy resolution can be improved by using a simple depth correction weight for the four depths (3 constants only, see [3] for details). This technique allows to adjust downwards readout cells with large signals, due to electromagnetic clusters. In the energy dependence of the resolution the statistical term, dominated by sampling fluctuations, is unaffected, but the constant term is reduced by about 1 %.

### Theta Angular Scan at 50 GeV

A fine theta scan from \(0^{\circ}\) to \(30^{\circ}\) has been performed with 50 GeV pions. Fig. 27 shows the variation of the measured energy with respect to the \(20^{\circ}\) point. The response is very uniform except in a range of a few degrees around \(6^{\circ}\) where the response of the calorimeter is 2-3 % lower. This is due to alignment of scintillators in the staggered tile/iron geometry. This effect appears in the standalone Tile calorimeter geometry but is substantially attenuated with the LAr em compartment in front as will be the case in the final ATLAS configuration. In addition, the tile sizes in ATLAS have been studied to avoid such alignment effects.

Fig. 27 shows as well the corresponding resolution. Above \(15^{\circ}\) the resolution is almost constant, while below it slightly deteriorates due to the effect mentioned above.

Figure 25: Energy resolutions as a function of the energy.

### Uniformity Scans over Wide Ranges of Z and y

A large vertical (\(y\)) and horizontal (\(Z\)) grid scans have been performed with 100 and 180 GeV pions at \(\Theta=10^{\circ}\).

Fig. 28 shows the response to 100 GeV pions as a function of the impact point \(Z\) on the face of the calorimeter from \(-40\) cm to 20 cm. The points are obtained fitting the energy spectrum

Figure 27: Top figure: mean energy of 50 GeV pions for different \(\Theta\) angle, the values are normalized to the value at \(\Theta=20^{\circ}\). Bottom figure: the corresponding relative resolution \(\sigma/E\) in %.

at each impact point to a Gaussian and then are normalized to the mean value over the scan. At about 6 cm, lateral leakage becomes evident. The uniformity in the range \(-40\) cm to 6 cm is good to 0.84 %.

The five prototype modules have also been scanned across \(y\) testing in this way the effect of the physical crack between modules. This crack is manly due space needed to extract the fibres to the PMTs. Fig. 29a shows, as a function of \(y\), the sum of the signals in the modules on one side (modules 1, 2 and 3) and on the other side (modules 4 and 5) of the crack, as well as the total sum, normalized to the signal at the center of the module 3. The \(y\) coordinate is measured from the crack, in a line perpendicular to the crack plane, extrapolated to the depth of maximum energy deposition. Each point in Fig. 29a represents the sum of runs taken at that value of \(y\), for the \(Z\) interval \(-20\) cm to \(0\) cm. For each point the average energy deposition is the mean value of a Gaussian fit. The crack is visible as a small drop of 5 % in the signal at \(y=0\). In Fig. 29b are plotted the energy resolutions for all the points of the scan. A Gaussian fit to that distribution gives \(\sigma=1.7\) %.

### Longitudinal Leakage

The amount of energy leaking through the calorimeter has been measured using the "backward muon wall" (\(77\) cm \(\times\) 73 cm) placed just behind the calorimeter modules. In 1995 a "side muon wall" (\(40\) cm \(\times\) 115 cm) was also fixed to a side of the central prototype module. Both walls consist of a set (eight and six) of adjacent \(40\) cm \(\times\) 20 cm \(\times\) 2 cm plastic scintillator counters read out by 2" PMTs. The counters have been intercalibrated using muons. The number of photoelectrons has been estimated from the ratio of \(\sigma(i)_{mip}\) and \(<\)_ADC_\(>_{mip}^{i}\) to be roughly 100 per mip using those energy distribution spectra.

The probability of pion induced shower leakage in the longitudinal direction is defined as the ratio of the number of events with at least one hit in the backward scintillator wall over the total number of events, using the following constraint:

\[ADC^{i}>\ (<\ ADC>_{mip}^{i}-3\sigma(i)_{mip})\]

Figure 28: (a): Uniformiy scan with 100 GeV pions at 10\({}^{\circ}\). The ratios are calculated with respect to the mean signal. (b): The distribution of the ratios in the range \(-40\) cm to \(6\) cm.

The events having muon contamination in the pion beam have been suppressed offline using information about their energy deposit in the calorimeter modules. The remaining muon background is then estimated to be \(0.5-2.0\) % and subtracted. The scintillator wall is centered with respect to the backward wall of calorimeter modules but it does not cover the whole area. The acceptance is calculated from the ratio of the number of events hitting both the central and the outer counters in scintillator wall over the number of events having hits in the outer detectors only, assuming an exponential fall in the lateral distribution of leaking particles; acceptance values ranging between 0.65 and 0.87 for the different energies have been estimated.

Fig. 30a shows a comparison of the punchthrough probability of showers induced by pions of momenta 20, 50, 100, 150, 180 and 300 GeV using our data and the RD5 result [22] and assuming a corresponding iron equivalent thickness (1.58 m).

The agreement between the two measurements proves that the punchthrough probability for the Tile calorimeter prototype with longitudinal segmentation of absorbers and scintillators is the same as for a classical sampling hadron calorimeter. The punchthrough probability depends approximately linearly from the pion energy: the value is 0.15 % per 1 GeV. The difference between energy spectra with and without leakage is shown in Fig. 31 in a logarithmic scale for 100 GeV pions. For events with longitudinal leakage the peak position of the total energy

The scan covers the region from the center of the central module to the center of the next module. b) Projection of the peak values obtained in the grid scan fitted by a Gaussian. The values have been normalized to the value at the center of module 3 and not to the average value. This is why the distribution is not centered at 1.

distribution is shifted to lower values and the distribution has a tail at low energy.

If one select events where the shower develops at the beginning of the calorimeter, the difference in the measured mean energy value is of 5.5 % (from the Gaussian fits). Events where the shower develops later origin low energy tails. Therefore the difference of mean values of deposited energy (see Fig. 30b) is larger than the difference of the peak values.

## 7 Pion Response: Combined Test

The combined electromagnetic and hadronic prototype response to pions of various energies (20, 50, 100, 150, 200 and 300 GeV) at an incident \(\Theta\) angle of 11.3\({}^{0}\) has been investigated. The experimental setup is shown in Fig. 17. The total thickness of the electromagnetic compartment is about 1.2 interaction lengths, while that of the hadronic one is about 8.7. As a first step, the energy released in the prototype has been reconstructed using a minimal set of corrections introduced to take into account various detector effects. The resulting e/\(\pi\) ratio has been studied. Then, to improve the performance, a more sophisticated correction algorithm has been developed, based on different weights assigned to the calorimeter longitudinal samplings. This procedure is similar to what has been done for the analysis of the standalone data [3].

Detector energy resolution and linearity have been calculated and the results obtained with the two techniques are compared. Finally, the transverse and longitudinal pion shower developments are examined.

### Energy Dependence of the Pion Response

The simplest algorithm developed to reconstruct the energy follows the steps listed below:

1. An intercalibration constant \(a\) between the electromagnetic and the hadronic calorimeter is determined; the total energy is expressed as:

Figure 31: Total Energy in the Tile calorimeter prototype for events without (solid line) and with (dashed line) leakage.

\[E_{tot}=a\cdot E_{had}+E_{em} \tag{1}\]
2. A correction (E\({}_{expos}\)) is defined to take into account the energy lost in the dead material of the cryostat. The correction consists of a constant \(c\) multiplied by the geometrical mean between the energy released in the last electromagnetic and the first hadronic samplings. The constant \(c\) is chosen such as to minimize the resolution. \[E_{expos}=c\cdot\sqrt{E_{had}\cdot E_{em3}}\] (2)
3. A quadratic correction for the em section is introduced to get the response independent from the energy released in this compartment.

The total reconstructed energy is finally expressed as:

\[E_{tot}=a\cdot E_{had}+E_{em}+b\cdot E_{em}^{2}+c\cdot\sqrt{E_{had1}\cdot E_{ em3}} \tag{3}\]

with \(a=0.17\), \(b=-0.0038\), \(c=0.44\). As a first approach these 3 parameters are taken as energy independent.

Fig. 32 shows a distribution of the total energy versus the electromagnetic one for the various correction steps, in the case of 300 GeV pions. The inset illustrates the E\({}_{tot}\) distribution.

Fig. 33a shows the distribution of the estimated energy lost in the cryostat normalized to the nominal pion beam energy as a function of the fraction of energy released in the electromagnetic compartment. The shape of the profiles for the two extreme values of energy is similar and both peak at around 20 %. Fig. 33b shows the percentage of the total energy lost in the cryostat for the various energies under study. The value is about 4 %.

Figure 32: Total energy vs electromagnetic energy for the various steps of the total energy reconstruction.

The line shapes for all the investigated energies are shown in Fig. 34. Peak and \(\sigma\) values are extracted with a Gaussian fit over a \(\pm 2\sigma\) range. All spectra display no tails on the high energy side. Low energy tails appear, mostly due to events which suffer from an incomplete lateral or longitudinal container of the shower. Fig. 35 shows how the low energy tails at 300 GeV are reduced once all the events which leave a signal in the muon wall, placed behind the tile calorimeter, are rejected. In the 20 GeV pions case some low energy tail survives. This effect is mostly due to muon events which remain undetected in the muon wall (due to the intrinsic inefficiency of the system) or to pathological events.

The e/\(\pi\) ratio as a function of energy is given in Fig. 36. For this calculation electrons of the same energies were available. The value lays in the range between 1.1 at 300 GeV and 1.25 at 20 GeV, very similar to what has been found in the standalone analysis.

The distribution has been fitted using the function \([a\cdot(1+(b-1)\cdot 0.11\cdot\ln E)]^{-1}\) which is the inverse of the function used to fit the non-linearity distribution for a calorimeter ([21]), with \(b\) being the value of the e/h ratio. The fit suggest an e/h value of 1.42. It is well known that an e/\(\pi\neq 1\) causes deviation from linearity in the hadronic response vs energy, besides broadening the energy resolution. Since the fraction of electromagnetic energy in a pion shower increases logarithmically with the energy, one expects the relative response to pions to increase with energy, as shown in Fig. 37 (black dots, relative to the non weighteddata). The non-linear behavior is more pronounced at energies below 100 GeV.

The E/E\({}_{beam}\) ratios are normalized to the value at 100 GeV, and show an approximately logarithmic rise with energy.

Experience from previous calorimeter prototypes [3, 23] suggest to try sampling corrections in order to improve both aspects of the performance (linearity and resolution). The correction strategy chosen here is to compensate for local \(\pi^{0}\) fluctuations by adjusting downwards the response of readout cells with large signals, by means of a minimal set of parameters. A similar method has been previously applied to the standalone data with success [3]. Weighting parameters are introduced for each longitudinal samplings and the charge measured for each cell is corrected according to the formula:

\[Q_{ij}^{corr}=Q_{ij}\cdot(1-\frac{P_{j}}{Q_{j}}Q_{ij}) \tag{4}\]

Figure 33: (a) Distribution of the estimated energy lost in the cryostat normalized to the nominal pion beam energy as a function of the fraction of energy released in the electromagnetic compartment. (b) Percentage of the total energy lost in the cryostat for the various energies under study.

where Q\({}_{ij}\) is the (charge) signal in each readout cell, with index \(i\) for the transverse segmentation and index \(j\) for the longitudinal segmentation, Q\({}_{j}\) is the sum of the signals in all the cell in a longitudinal sampling and P\({}_{j}\) is the weight to be found for each sampling. In total 8 parameters should be determined: one for each detector sampling plus an additional intercalibration parameter between the two calorimeters. The method chosen to determine these parameters is the following:

1. The 4 parameters of the hadronic compartment are determined by selecting events which deposit one mip in each of the 3 samplings of the electromagnetic calorimeter. The total energy is then calculated using these weights, and fixed at the beam energy value multiplying it by an intercalibration constant.
2. The cryostat energy, parametrized in the form explained above is then added.
3. The parameters for each electromagnetic calorimeter sampling are determined by relaxing the mip requirement, in an iterative way.

Four energy points have been corrected in this way: from 50 to 300 GeV. Fig. 37 compares the linearity for the corrected and uncorrected data. One sees that linearity is mostly recovered when weighting is applied.

The energy resolutions (\(\sigma/E\)) vs \(1/\sqrt{E}\) for the corrected (weighted) and uncorrected data are given in Fig. 38. In comparison with the standalone case, the energy resolution for the corrected combined data is slightly better at high energies (above 100 GeV) whereas it degrades at low energies mainly due to instrumental effects not yet entirely under control. A reasonable parametrization of the energy resolution is given by \((45\,\%/\sqrt{E}+1.5\,\%)\oplus 2.5/E\). This curve is overlayed to the data in Fig. 38 to guide the eyes.

Figure 34: Pion energy spectra at different incident energies.

Electronic noise contribution to the signal, which scales as 1/E, affects the \(\sigma\)/E ratio at low energies and it has been investigated. The total noise in the system readout channels (\(\sigma_{tot}\), defined as the \(\sigma\) of the pedestals distribution), consists of two sources: incoherent (\(\sigma_{incosh}\) i.e. electronic noise) and coherent (i.e. detector and electronic cross-talk or pickup from external sources). The incoherent noise scales as \(\sqrt{N_{ch}}\) (where \(N_{ch}\) is the number of readout channels), while the coherent goes like \(N_{ch}\). Therefore, even very small coherent noise contributions can degrade the resolution significantly if a great number of readout channels are involved [24]. The electromagnetic compartment uses 297 readout channels, the hadronic one 200. The plot in the left side in Fig. 39 shows the \(\sigma_{tot}\) and \(\sigma_{incoh}\) variation as a function of \(N_{ch}\) for the em compartment (few cells very noisy are not added in this plot). The total noise contribution

in the electromagnetic calorimeter (including all cells) has been measured from pedestal to be around 1.45 GeV. The right side plot in Fig. 39 shows a distribution of the pedestal events when all readout channel (em + hadronic cells) are summed. The total noise is around 1.5-1.6 GeV being the contribution from the hadronic 0.6 GeV. Some level of coherent noise is also visible in the hadron calorimeter, and must be further understood.

### Longitudinal Profiles

The longitudinal energy density profile is the distribution of the fraction of the total energy released in one sampling per interaction length (E\({}_{i}\)) vs the interaction length. This fractional energy is therefore defined as:

\[E_{i}=\frac{<E_{\it{sample}(i)}>/<E_{\it{tot}}>}{\Delta\lambda_{i}} \tag{5}\]

Figure 37: Linearity plot. All the points are normalized to the point at 100 GeV.

Figure 38: Energy resolution before and after corrections.

where \(i\) is the longitudinal sampling number, \(\Delta\lambda_{i}\) is the number of interaction lengths which characterize sampling \(i\), and E\({}_{tot}\) is the total energy released in the calorimeters. The upper plot of Fig. 40 shows the longitudinal profile for 300 GeV pions together with the Montecarlo prediction. The two curves superimposed represent the analytical expression, proposed by Bock et al. [25] and calculated with the input parameters appropriate to our case, which describes the pion shower in the electromagnetic calorimeter (first 3 longitudinal samplings). The dashed line describes a shower which starts at the beginning of the calorimeter, the dotted line describes a shower starting after 0.2 \(\lambda\). The calculation has not been extended to include the shower development prediction in the samplings of the hadron compartment.

### Longitudinal Leakage

In analogy to what has been done in the standalone analysis, punchthroughs studies have been performed for the combined run too. Punchthrough particles can be muons from \(\pi\) and \(K\) decays in an hadronic cascade, or charged particles (mainly soft electrons and hadrons) from showers not fully contained in the calorimeter. For the shower leakage measurement a punchthrough detector consisting of 10 scintillators was located behind the calorimeters. The beam was almost centering this scintillator wall in the vertical direction, while it was displaced in the horizontal direction. The acceptance has been extrapolated from that of the standalone hadron calorimeter setup and of the muon wall centered behind. Only punchthrough particles of energy corresponding to at least one mip in any of the 10 scintillators has been taken into account. Mip energy in the scintillator have been evaluated as in the standalone setup when possible, otherwise the "minimum" between the pedestal peak and one mip peak has been taken. With this approach very soft particles has not been considered as punchthroughs. Fig. 41a shows the probability of pion induced shower longitudinal leakage as a function of the beam energy. Fig. 41b shows the energy loss as a function of the beam energy, where the energy loss is defined as the peak-to-peak difference between the energy distributions of events with and without leakage. From here one sees that the energy loss for events with longitudinal leakage is about 2-3 %.

The data have still to be fully analyzed before drawing final conclusions on the linearity and energy resolution of the combined prototype. However, the offline analysis of these data pointed out the presence of an excess of noise in some readout channels as well as non-Gaussian low energy tails of the energy distribution at 20 GeV. These problems are still under study and in addition, a new combined test is foreseen in the near future.

## 8 Muon response

Although the main task of the hadronic calorimeter is not to detect muons, this detector can provide useful information on the muon energy loss. Muons with energy above 2 GeV will be measured in ATLAS in a system of chambers placed inside the air core toroid after passing more than 100 radiation lengths of electromagnetic and hadronic calorimetry.

For low \(p_{T}\) (\(p_{T}\) muons between 2 and 5 GeV) the calorimetric measurements are important because a significant fraction of the energy will be absorbed in the calorimeter. In this energy range simulation studies show that calorimeter information is very useful to identify muons from B-decays and muons inside b-jets. The idea is to exploit the fact that very little energy is deposited in the last longitudinal section (after 8 interaction length) by light quark jets and gluon jets, in comparison to muons [27].

The design values for the muon spectrometer in ATLAS are : \(\Delta p_{T}/p_{T}=2\) % at 100 GeV and about 10 % at 1000 GeV. The fluctuations of the energy loss in the calorimeter will limit the precision of the muon momentum measurement. In general these fluctuations are reduced when

The two curves superimposed represent the analytical expression which describes the pion shower in the electromagnetic calorimeter. The dashed line describes a shower which starts at the beginning of the calorimeter, the dotted line describes a shower starting after 0.2 \(\lambda\). (b) Longitudinal energy density profile for pions of different energies.

the calorimeter absorber is made out of low Z material, like steel instead of lead or uranium. In ATLAS the calorimeter contribution will dominate the muon momentum resolution in the muon spectrometers below 30 GeV [9]. Above 30 GeV multiple scattering in the muon chambers and systematic effects (like chamber alignment) will dominate [9]. In fact the fluctuations of the energy loss in the calorimeter are small in case of iron (about 0.5 % for muon energies above 100 GeV). If, for instance, the absorber material would be lead, the fluctuations of the energy loss in the calorimeter with the same sampling fraction would be about several times [28].

The light output produced by muons in a scintillator are usually very small compared to signals from particles for which the calorimeter system was intended. A request to also identify muons with the calorimeter puts additional demands on the dynamic range of the readout system. Low noise and high photoelectron statistics are additional important ingredients to perform well with so small energy depositions.

All these aspects have been studied and investigated using muon beams at various energies (10, 20, 50, 100, 150, 180, 200 and 300 GeV) and incident polar angles between 0 and 90\({}^{0}\) on the prototype setup.

### Light yield

In the last three years a considerable R&D has been put in the light yield optimization. In particular, the characteristics of the tiles and of the fibre components and of the tile/fibre coupling have been optimized. This work is described in sections 2.2 and 2.3.

The number of photoelectrons for the prototypes constructed between 1993 and 1995 was determined using three different methods: neutral filters [3], muon data and laser information. In the following we report on the study done with 150 GeV muons impinging the calorimeter at \(\theta_{z}=90^{0}\).

The formula to determine the number of photoelectrons per GeV of deposited energy per calorimeter cell summed over the left and right PMTs, \(N_{pe}\), can be found in Ref. [29] as:

\[N_{pe}=\ C\left(\frac{Q_{e}}{\sigma_{e}}\right)^{2}\frac{1}{Q_{e}}\alpha_{e} \tag{6}\]

Figure 41: (a) Punchthrough probability for pions (combined LAr/ile). Results from RD5 (extrapolated to 1.9 m of iron) and from CCFR are also plotted. (b) Energy loss for events with longitudinal leakage (combined LAr/tile).

where \(\alpha_{e}=5.59\) pC/GeV is the conversion factor measured from the electron data, \(Q_{e}\) is the cell charge (in pC) averaged over the module section, \(\sigma_{e}\) is the width of the charge distribution arising from photostatistics (\(\sigma_{e}\) is calculated as the gaussian width of the charge difference distribution between the photomultipliers left and right of the cell) and the parameter C is the correction factor for the effects of photostatistics at subsequent dynodes of the PMT which was assumed to be 1 (whereas Ref [29] uses C = 1.11).

The result as a function of the tile number is shown in Fig. 42 for the prototypes of 1993, 1994 and 1995. Each data point corresponds to the average response in a cell made by a group of 11 or 12 tiles of 3 mm thickness each. The tile size increases gradually from tile number 1 to 18. In a addition, tiles of sampling 1 are read out by the longest fibres, whereas tiles of sampling 4 are read out by the shortest fibres. Despite these effects one observe that, within the same longitudinal sampling, the light yield is rather uniform.

The improvement on the average light yield from 24 pe/GeV to 64 pe/GeV is due to the improvements on the optical quality of the fibres and tiles and on the optical coupling between tiles and fibre (see sections 2.2 and 2.3).

About the same number of photoelectrons/GeV have been obtained for the 1993 prototypes looking into the electromagnetic energy resolution when filters with several attenuation factors have been used [3]. Using the filter method 20 and 25 pe/GeV have been obtained for tile 10 and tile 6, respectively.

### The Effect of Photoelectron Statistics using muons

The energy distribution measured in the calorimeter by 150 GeV muons at 10\({}^{0}\) is shown in Fig. 43a and Fig. 43b for the whole calorimeter depth (9 \(\lambda\)) and for the first longitudinal sampling (1.5 \(\lambda\)). The energy spectrum is approximately Landau distributed with a large tail at high energy due to \(\mu\) radiation in the absorber material or direct \(e^{+}e^{-}\) pair production.

The visible energy spectrum obtained by Monte Carlo simulation is also shown in Fig. 43 with or without experimental fluctuations, i.e. fibre/tile fluctuations, PMT noise and photoelectron statistics, have been taken into account. The Monte Carlo simulations agree well with the experimental data when experimental smearing is taken into account. The photostatistics is the dominating experimental effect (about 60 pe/GeV at present). The broadening of the distribution due to this effect is mostly seen in sampling 1, the thinner compartment of the calorimeter (30 cm).

Figure 42: Number of photoelectrons per GeV per cell (2 PMTs) as a function of the tile number. Values are given for prototypes build in 1993, 1994 and 1995.

The pedestal distribution after subtracting the mean pedestal value is also plotted in Fig. 43. The width, corresponding to a noise of about 40 MeV/cell, is very small and consequently well separated from the muon signal,

The effect of broadening the muon energy spectrum due to photoelectron statistics was observed experimentally. The response to 150 GeV muons traversing 9 \(\lambda\) prototypes with 3 different light yield values, 24 pe/GeV, 48pe/GeV and 64 pe/GeV for an incident \(\theta_{z}=10^{0}\) is shown in Fig. 44. This broadening effect is clearly visible when restricting the energy spectrum to the first longitudinal sampling. Only a small broadening of the width of the muon line shape is observed for the module with 24 pe/GeV when integrating over the full calorimeter depth. This indicates that a further increase on the light yield above 64 pe/GeV would not improve on the quality of the muon measurements. Nevertheless ageing effects and radiation damage will reduce the light yield and in long term we will profit of the highest light output.

### The Energy Dependence of the Muon Response

The muon distributions for the experimental data and the Monte Carlo (all instrumental effects included) have been studied for energies between 10 and 300 GeV traversing the tile calorimeter at \(\theta_{z}=10^{0}\) (Fig. 45). The Monte Carlo data includes also 2 and 5 GeV.

Both the truncated mean and the most probable value (mop) of the signals have been calculated. The mop values are obtained from a fit of the signal distributions to a Moyal function [20]. One observes that with increasing energy the peak value makes gradually to larger values of energy and the signal distribution gets more pronounced high energy tails. The expected increase of the high energy tails with increasing energy is well reproduced by the Monte Carlo. For 2 and 5 GeV the simulated distribution is almost symmetric (negligible low energy tail).

The average and the most probable values for the energy loss as a function of the muon beam energy for \(\theta=10^{0}\) is shown in Fig. 46. The most probable energy deposition increases by approximately 7 % per 100 GeV/c increase in the muon momentum over the range 50-300 GeV. The truncated mean increases more steeply, approximately 10 % per 100 GeV/c in the muon momentum. The dashed line is the expected mean energy deposited in the plastic scintillator taken from [30] and normalized arbitrary to the experimental data.

Fig. 47a shows the muon fractional energy loss \(v\) in the calorimeter, i.e. the ratio of the energy measured in the calorimeter and the incident energy (\(v=\Delta E_{\mu}/E_{\mu}\)), as a function of the

Figure 43: Energy measured in the calorimeter for muons of 150 GeV muons traversing (a) the whole Tile calorimeter depth (9 \(\lambda\)), (b) the first sampling (1.5 \(\lambda\)). The dotted points are data while the dashed and full lines are Monte Carlo results with and without experimental fluctuations, respectively. The pedestal width is also shown. The conversion of the signal (in pC) to energy (in GeV) was made using the electron calibration factor (5.59 pC/GeV). The MC has been normalized to the experimental data to give the same peak value.

muon energy for both, muon data and Monte Carlo simulations. The muon fractional energy loss \(v\) continuously decreases as a function of the energy, 0.9 % (2.7 GeV) at 300 GeV up to 22.6 % (2.6 GeV) at 10 GeV. From the Monte Carlo a loss of 45% at 5 GeV and of about 100% at 2 GeV is expected.

The muon energy measured in the calorimeter of about 2.7 GeV can be compared to the expected energy deposition of minimum bias events per bunch-crossing at LHC nominal luminosity (1.1 x 10\({}^{34}cm^{-2}sec^{-1}\)), which is about 0.2 GeV into a \(\Delta\eta\times\Delta\phi\) = 0.1 \(\times\) 0.1 calorimeter cell. This gives a comfortable margin for detecting isolated muons in the calorimeter even at full luminosity (S/B = 10).

The rms spread of the fractional energy loss \(v\) measured in the Tile calorimeter (\(\sigma_{rms}/E_{\mu}\)) gives an indication on how precise the energy loss fluctuations in the calorimeter material can be estimated. This value is about 0.5 % for muon energies above 100 GeV (Fig. 47b). This good precision is mainly due to the relative low Z absorber material (iron) used in the Tile calorimeter. If, for example, the material absorber would be lead, the fluctuations of the energy

A Moyal fit applied on the module with the highest light yield is show as a full curve. The conversion of the signal (in pC) to energy (in GeV) was made using the electron calibration factor (5.59 pC/GeV).

Figure 45: Energy measured in the calorimeter from Monte Carlo and data for muons of 5 (only MC), 20,100 and 200 GeV traversing the whole Tile calorimeter length (9 \(\lambda\)). The MC has been normalized to the experimental data to give the same peak value.

loss in the calorimeter with the same sampling fraction would be about 10 times bigger [28].

In this energy range the muon momentum resolution is dominated by multiple scattering in the muon chambers and by the measurement error including chamber alignment contribution [9].

For energies below 100 GeV \(\sigma_{rms}/E_{\mu}\) increases rapidly up to 5 % for 10 GeV muons. For muon energies below 10 GeV only simulation results are available, but the good agreement between data and simulation data in the 10-300 energy range let us conclude that in ATLAS for energies lower than 10 GeV the muon momentum resolution is not anymore dependent on the quality of the muon spectrometer placed behind the hadron calorimeter. Usually the precision of the muon momentum determination in a calorimeter using the energy loss in the high energy tail on an event-by-event basis is limited. From simulations we expect a precision of 8.2% for 5 GeV and 20.5% for 2 GeV muons in the Tile calorimeter. The possibility to determine the

muon momentum with good precision even at low energies will be discussed below.

A detailed study of the spectrum of the fractional energy loss \(v\) has been done in the range 0.01-0.90 with 150 GeV muons, using the Tile calorimeter and a scintillator detector wall placed beyond the calorimeter [31]. The results are compared with the theoretical predictions which include all radiation effects (pairs, energetic knock-on electrons production and bremsstrahlung). Here the main results are summarized, for details see Ref. [31]. The spectrum of the differential loss \(v\,dP/dv\) per one radiation length in iron is plotted on Fig. 48 (Ref.[30]) together with data which are uncorrected for ionization loss.

The data are compared with theoretical calculations of Kel'ner and Kotov for pair production (curve P in Fig. 48), Bhabha formula for knock-on electrons (K) and Petrukhin and Shestakov calculations for bremsstrahlung process (B). Our data are in very good agreement with theoretical calculations (without any free parameters) in the whole range from 0.01 to 0.7 of fractional energy loss. Since in different regions of fractional energy loss different processes dominate, an independent comparison was also made for three different \(v\) intervals. The integrated probabil

ities \(\Delta P=\int_{\omega_{min}}^{\omega_{max}}\frac{dP}{d\omega}dv\) have been calculated over the whole range of measured \(v\) and in three different intervals of \(v\). The total integrated probability for fractional loss greater than 0.01 of 150 \(GeV\) muon per radiation length in iron is measured (1.59 \(\pm\) 0.03\({}_{stat.}\)\(\pm\) 0.03\({}_{syst.}\)) \(\cdot\) 10\({}^{-3}\) in agreement with theoretical prediction 1.56 \(\cdot\) 10\({}^{-3}\). Similarly a good agreement is also found in three different intervals of \(v\) where the dominant contribution is caused by different processes of energy loss.

As already mentioned, the electromagnetic shower component developed by high energy muons (Bremsstrahlung, electron-positron pairs and energetic knock-on electron production) will produce a signal in the calorimeter appearing mostly in the high energy tail of the muon signal distribution. The signal deposited in the scintillator by those events is highly correlated to the energy loss deposited in the absorber material as seen in simulation results (Fig. 49a and b), where the energy deposited in the iron for 10 and 300 GeV incident muons is shown as a function of the expected energy deposited in the scintillator. The correlation is clearly visible for events that deposit energies in the scintillator above 60-70 MeV, i.e. all the events above the most probable value (see Fig 46). Only for incident muon energies below 5 GeV the energy deposited in the scintillator is uncorrelated with the energy deposited in the iron (pure dE/dx energy loss mechanism).

### The e/mip Ratio

All the muon results shown up to now have been obtained under the assumption that the measured muon signals may be converted in GeV using the calibration constants obtained from the calorimeter response to electrons (5.59 pC/GeV). This is not exactly correct. The sampling fraction for electromagnetic showers and minimum ionizing particles may be quite different, especially in high-Z calorimeters. The e/mip ratio, a quantity which relates the signals from e.m. showers to those of minimum ionizing particles (mip) depositing the same amount of energy in the calorimeter has been determined. This parameter gives the absolute sampling fraction for electromagnetic showers, since the average energy lost by a mip can be obtained directly from the detector composition and their physical properties (dE/dx and density). This parameter is important in view of understanding the precise \(e/h\) value of the calorimeter. Since the muon behaves fairly well as a mip, the muon data has been used for this analysis. In order to be less sensitive to systematics effects the analysis described in this section has been done using the most probable values instead of the average ones.

The Tile calorimeter consists of 77.8% of iron, 16.7% of polystyrene and 5.5 % of air, and has a depth of 180 cm at 0 degrees. From Ref. [32] we compute that a mip loses most probably 1522 MeV in this structure, out of which 51 MeV goes into the the plastic scintillator. The sampling fraction for a mip amounts to \(S_{fraction}\) = 51/1522 - 3.4% (3.6% if the average values are taken instead of the mop values).

A first approximation of the e/mip ratio can be obtained from the most probable value of the energy measured in the calorimeter by 10 GeV muons, which is found to be 2260 MeV. This result is based in the electron calibration factor of 5.59 pC/GeV. Therefore the e/mip = 1522/2260 = 0.67. This is however not exactly correct, since energy loss of 10 GeV muons does not have exactly the same behavior as mips. The contribution of high energy processes such as \(\delta\)-ray emission, bremsstrahlung, electron-positron pairs are strongly dependent on the muon energy and on the material (Z value). The same Monte Carlo program already mentioned, with a detailed description of the calorimeter structure has been used to simulates the passage of muons through the calorimeter taking into account all the details of the processes mentioned above. The program calculates for each muon energy the most probable energy deposited in the plastic scintillator, which can then be compared to the 51 MeV for a mip mentioned above. We have calculated the e/mip ratio as:

\[e/mip\,=\,\frac{1}{S_{fraction}}\frac{E_{M\,C}}{E_{exp.}} \tag{7}\]with \(S_{fraction}=0.0337\) as described above and where \(E_{MC}\) is the simulated most probable energy measured in the calorimeter and \(E_{exp.}\) is the most probable energy measured in the calorimeter using the conversion factor from electron data (\(5.59\) pC/GeV). This procedure allows to determine the e/mip ratio for each muon energy. The result is shown in Fig. 50. This ratio is found to be energy independent as expected. The average value has been determined to 0.862. The energy dependence of \(\mu\)/mip ratio is also shown in Fig. 50. Also this value increases with the energy as expected.

### Response Uniformity

The uniformity of the response to muons as been studied as a function of the coordinates \((\theta,\phi,Z)\). A span of 60 cm in front of the calorimeter face was scanned with 180 GeV muons at \(\theta=10^{0}\). The results of the scan are shown in Fig. 51a and Fig. 51b. The signal response is quite uniform, the distribution has a r.m.s. = 1.8%.

The uniformity scan in the y vertical direction (phi scan) have been studied using 150 GeV

Figure 51: (a) Uniformity scan along the z direction using 180 GeV muons at a \(\theta\) angle of incidence of \(10^{0}\). (b) Distribution of the average signals.

muons at \(\theta=10^{0}\). Fig. 52a shows the signals in the module below and above the interface between the 2 modules (crack) as a function of y (0.56\({}^{0}\) in \(\phi\) correspond to 1 cm in y). The signal for the sum of the 2 modules is also shown. Signals have been normalized to the signal at the center of module 3.

The y coordinate is measured from the crack, in a line perpendicular to the crack plane. The crack is visible by a drop in the signal of about 60% at y = 0 cm. This decrease in the crack is due to an air gap between the 2 modules. In this region muons have a big probability to pass the 1.8 m of the calorimeter staying mostly in air. The smaller sampling fraction in this region due to less amount of scintillator leaving space for the fibres is also responsible for the decrease in signal. In Fig. 52b the distribution of the normalized signals is shown together with a Gaussian fit with a \(\sigma=2.5\%\). Outside the crack region a rather uniform response over the full module surface is observed. The non-uniform response observed in the past has been solved for present prototypes due to a better tile masking and tile/fibre coupling geometry.

The \(\theta\) angular dependence of the muon signals has also been studied with 200 GeV muons. The signal normalized to the same path length is shown in Fig. 53 as a function of the incident \(\theta_{z}\) angle for data and Monte Carlo simulations. A dependence of the \(\theta_{z}\) angle within 5 % is observed. This effect is also well reproduced by the MC. A similar behavior is observed for pions (Fig. 27a). This can be understood due to alignment effects in the staggered tile/iron geometry, because the sampling fraction can change with the \(\theta_{z}\) angle for small angles. This effect can still be minimized, nevertheless in ATLAS the presence of a magnetic field will reduce this effect.

## 9 Concluding Remarks

RD34 has ended its first generic R &D phase and is now ready to enter to a new period, where the Tile calorimeter has to be finalized in its design for the ATLAS configuration and then constructed.

The required performance of this calorimeter has been achieved and proven with experimental data obtained in testbeams. Still some improvements are possible.

Most of the remaining problems to be solved in the near future are related to mass production. This represents a challenging effort, because of the quantities involved and of the complexity of the work to be done to all different components.

A first step in this direction will be made over the next two years, where a complete full size module 0 (pre-series) for both, the barrel and the extended barrel of the ATLAS detector, will be constructed and tested. Final technologies and construction techniques of all of the detector components will have to be proven with this work, including mechanical construction of the absorber and of the support structure, optical elements and mechanics of the readout. Other aspects like calibration hardware and readout electronics might take 2 or 3 years more to be finalized before mass production.

Not all of the impressive quantity of test beam data already taken has been fully analyzed, especially those to study the performance of the combined LAr and the Tile calorimeter. More work needs to be done to understand this complex hybrid environment. Over the next few years more data will be taken in the combined mode with more realistic setups. It is also foreseen to take data and to study the behaviour of the calorimeters in the very low energy region (a few hundred MeV up to a few GeV) to gain experience on the energy scale problem.

This work is the result of the collaborative effort of many people and resources of several Laboratories and Institutions. We are very grateful and want to express our biggest thanks to all technical staff and the finance agencies involved, which cannot be quoted individually.2
