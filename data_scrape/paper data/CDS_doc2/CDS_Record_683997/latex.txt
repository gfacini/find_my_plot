Introduction

Since the accurate position of the anode wire in a proportional chamber is crucial for its reliable performance, special caution has to be taken for the wire stringing during the assembly procedure, as the Quality Assurance plan [1] foresees. As a part of the Quality Control (QC) procedure, the wire tension for each individual straw has to be measured after the assembly. The constrains on the wire tension are deduced from: (a) the breaking point of the wire (upper limit), and (b) the necessity to avoid wire sagging (lower limit).

The wire tension specification for the ATLAS barrel and end-cap TRT requires to maintain a minimum value of 50 g 1 over the ten years of operation foreseen for the detector. An upper limit is not imposed since the breaking point of the employed wire (gold-plated tungsten of 30 \(\mu\)m diameter) is well above the nominal tension value. The QC test of an assembled barrel module or end-cap wheel requires a first test of the tension during or just after the wire crimping in which 100% of the wires need to have a value of \((60\pm 5)\) g [1]. The wire will be restrung, if found outside this range. A second test, before sealing the module, will be performed in order to assure that 100% of the wires have tension above the 50 g limit.

Footnote 1: Tension of 1 g is equivalent to \(9.81\cdot 10^{-3}\) N.

The 4-plane type-A prototype consists of 3072 straws arranged in four layers. During both tests, it was positioned horizontally, with the passive webs lying on top. The wire stringing was performed using a weight of 60 g.

The aim of the presented measurements is two-fold. At a first stage, we are interested in the stability of the tension with time, validating thus the crimping tubes used and the stringing procedure followed for the production of the end-cap TRT wheels. At a second stage, the procedure itself has to be tested and optimised for large scale tests during the assembly of the TRT.

This note is organized as follows: Section 2 provides a short description of the instruments used and the relevant measuring procedures. In Section 3, the precision obtained with these devices is discussed. The results from the first and the second tension test are presented in Section 4, and their comparison is discussed in Section 5. Finally, the conclusions are summarized in Section 6.

## 2 Overview of instruments and procedures

The tension measurements of the TRT tubes' wires have been done using two different sets of devices; the Wavetek frequency generator or the StrawWire Tension Instrument (SWTI) [2]. Both methods rely on the acoustic excitation of the wire by a loudspeaker driven by a variable-frequency oscillator. This vibrates the module thus inducing a mechanical resonance in the wire. A negative potential of \(\sim 500\,\)V is put on the straw so that the capacitance variation induces a signal on the wire of amplitude proportional to the mechanical amplitude of the wire. The first harmonic frequency of the wire is then estimated by the peak position of the amplitude. Hence, the tension is easily calculated, using the linear mass density of the wire and the length of the straw, with an accuracy of order of 1%.

The set-up which is based on the 100 MHz Synthesized Arbitrary Waveform Generator (Wavetek(r) model 395) consists of a loudspeaker with power of 1 W, a single-channel amplifier (together with its LV supply) and an oscilloscope. The frequency generator drives a vibration to the loudspeaker which is attached to the module's inner ring. The signal is amplified by the probe and can be viewed at the oscilloscope. The frequency range [240, 300] Hz is scanned with a step of 1 Hz and the amplitude is monitored with the oscilloscope, thus making attainable the visual determination of the resonant frequency.

The use of the SWTI requires also a loudspeaker, as well as a 32-channel probe, an RS-232 cable and an oscilloscope for testing the device. The SWTI, equipped with a micro controller, has two main functionalities: it controls the frequency and power of the sound induced to the loudspeaker, and reads the amplitude data received from the probe. Both functions are controlled by the user through a PC (connected to the SWTI via the RS-232 port), by running the "Wire Tension Measurement Program" (WTMP) [3], which is developed under BridgeVIEW(r) 2.1. The program automatically scans frequencies with a selectable range and step and plots the amplitude of the wire's oscillation for a predefined range of wire numbers (1-32). It also determines the resonant frequency as the one where the higher amplitude has been observed and, finally, stores the data --in terms of frequency and tension-- as text files including information such as operator's name, time, wheel and connector indices. This set-up is capable of testing simultaneously 32 wires belonging to the same connector (cell). A sample of the program's working environment is shown in Fig. 1.

For the TRT geometry (type-A wheel), the tension is calculated from the first harmonic frequency by applying the formula:

\[T=0.00093\cdot f_{\rm r}^{2},\]

where \(T\) is the tension in g and \(f_{\rm r}\) the frequency in Hz. A detailed description of both methods, as well as the calculation of the tension from the resonant frequency, can be found in Ref. [2].

## 3 Precision of the SWTI method

In order to determine the precision on the measurement of the resonant frequency obtained by the SWTI device, a single straw (wire#22 of cell#82)2 was measured repeatedly 20 times. This wire was selected because it had a typical resonance in terms of width, shape and amplitude under nominal operating conditions. Therefore, the results of this exercise represent the average behaviour of the TRT wires. The WTMP provides to the user the possibility of determining the precision with which the amplitude is measured. This parameter is related to the statistics, i.e., number of periods of the wire oscillation, needed to determine the amplitude. This precision is reflected on the accuracy obtained for the resonance determination. Two values3 for the parameter 'Precision' were tested; 1 and 2. The acquired results for the resonant frequency are shown in Fig. 2 for both options.

Footnote 2: Throughout this study, the wires (or straws) are numbered according to the cell (i.e. connector) they belong to (0-95) and the wire (1-32) with thin the cell. Number 0 is assigned to the leftmost connector of web#2A and the numbering proceeds counter-clockwise in ascending order.

Footnote 3: In arbitrary units.

Using higher precision ('2'), the measurement is far more precise as can be

Figure 1: _Typical output of the WTMP, showing the resonance curve for one straw wire (upper plot) and the resonant frequency for each monitored wire (lower plot). Up to 32 wires can be measured simultaneously._seen in Fig. 2, limited only by t the step used for the frequency scanning (1 Hz). Thus, half of the step, i.e. 0.5 Hz or \(\sim\) 0.25 g, represents the systematic error of the measurement. The precision obtained with low (resp. high) precision is \(\pm\)0.8 g (resp. \(\pm\)0.2 g), i.e. 1% (resp. 0.3%), for one trial.

The time needed, however, for the procedure using option '2' is 42 s for a range of [230, 300] Hz, i.e. almost twice the one needed with option '1' (23 s). The corresponding time intervals for testing a cell (32 wires) is 23.25 min and 12.70 min for precision '2' and '1', respectively. Since the time needed for the measurement is a crucial benchmark of the procedure, while the precision has to suffice for the purposes of a QC procedure, precision '1' was chosen to be used throughout these studies. So the error on the following tension measurements is \(\pm\)0.8 g (1%).

## 4 Results of the first and second wire tension test

The wire tension of the 4-plane module was measured twice. The first time, just after the assembly of the prototype (November 1998), the 'Wavetek' set-up was used for these tests. Since then, the SWTI was developed together with the related software, so this was used for the second series of measurements (October 1999). The outcome of each test is discussed in this section.

Figure 2: _Distribution of the measured values for the resonant frequency of a single wire. The measurements were performed with ‘Precision 1’ (left) and ‘Precision 2’ (right)._

### First tension test (November 1998)

During and after the assembly of the 4-plane module, all wires were examined with respect to their tension using the Wavetek set-up, following the procedure described in Section 2. The results reviewed here correspond to the tension values obtained after the assembly [2].

The wire tension distribution of the first test are presented in Fig. 3 for each layer and in Fig. 4 for all wires of the module. Layer 1 corresponds to the straw plane closer to the passive webs. The quoted values for sigma equal to the estimated standard deviations (r.m.s.) for these samples. The mean values of the \(f_{\mathrm{r}}\)- and \(T\)-distributions for the first test are \(\langle f_{\mathrm{r}}\rangle=(261.7\pm 0.2)\,\mathrm{Hz}\) and \(\langle T\rangle=(63.98\pm 0.07)\,\mathrm{g}\), respectively.

The dispersion of the 4th layer's distribution, as expressed by the r.m.s. value, is larger (4.4 g) than the corresponding values for the other layers. This layer of straws was the first to be wired and tested, so the related procedures were not fully optimised yet. This characteristic of the 4th layer has also been observed during the second tension test.

The distribution exhibits a tail towards lower values, which are the most

important for this study. More precisely, seven wires had tension lower than the specified limit of 50 g. During the second test, one of them had also tension less than 50 g, while the remaining six wires had tension less than 56 g, which is rather normal taking into account the limited precision of the Wavetek method.

The number of the measured wires (3068) is not equal to the total number of straws (3072), because for four wires no resonance could be found either due to a problem inside the straw or because the electrical contact with the wire was broken.

As far as the measuring device and procedure with the Wavetek method is concerned, several remarks can be made.

* It offers a lot of information with respect to the frequency, the amplitude and also the shape of the signal. Thus it can be used for an additional examination of the wires, in case the automated procedure (SWTI) fails to find a resonance.
* It is too time-consuming to be used in large scale tests, as the tests are performed channel by channel.
* The precise determination of the peak position can be subjective, especially in cases with a low amplitude resonance.
* Since the frequency scanning usually ends when a resonance has been found, another higher in amplitude resonance can easily be omitted.

Figure 4: _Wire tension distribution for all wires of the first wire tension test_.

The last point was the reason for having many and large discrepancies between the first and second test results, as will be discussed in the following sections.

### Second tension test (October 1999)

The second wire tension test was performed using almost exclusively the SWTI. The SWTI allows the operator to regulate manually the power of the loudspeaker and the gain of the main amplifier. The nominal operating values for these parameters are 5-6 for the power and 7 for the gain. The time delay between measurements was set to 0 ms.

Another feature provided by the set-up is the regulation of the ADC's discrimination level. This permits the characterization of a resonance as such, only if the signal's amplitude exceeds a specific value, otherwise a negative value (\(-100\)) is recorded for both the frequency and the tension for a channel. Hence, a more reliable evaluation of the resonance position is feasible. This feature was not used during the first round of measurements, in order to keep track of the exact tension values returned by the device. It was used, however, when retesting some channels, and a discrimination level of 30-40 was considered as sufficient for these tests.

The efficiency of the measurements, in terms of the number of clear resonances per cell, depends on the appropriate positioning of the loudspeaker on the inner ring. After the experience we gained using this method on all wires of the 4-plane module, we found that the rectangular shaped speaker has to be positioned as shown in Fig. 5, so that the maximum energy transmission from the loudspeaker to the cell is attainable. A uniform excitation of the wires though can be achieved by employing a more complicated geometry using possibly more loudspeakers.

An important observation is that for some wires, particularly from layer 1 (which is closer to the loudspeaker), the amplitude was so high that the measured value was saturated (see Fig. 6). This was due to the narrow dynamical range of the ADC which reads the analog signal from the main amplifier. In this case, the value returned by the ADC is zero and the program characterizes as resonant frequency a point near the actual peak. This could be avoided by the decrease of the power, which resulted however in the lowering of other wires' amplitude, making thus their resonance undetectable. Another problem was that two of the probe's pins (#23 and #26) many times failed to read the signal

from the wires. For these reasons, after the use of the SWTI, some wires had to be remeasured using the Wavetek device.

In order to check the reliability of the measurements with SWTI, connectors #48-#53 (191 wires), which represent a typical spectrum of tension values, were retested. All the new results were found to be in accordance with the initial ones within \(\pm\)2 Hz (\(\pm\)1 g). This result is consistent with the one extracted in Section 3, concerning the accuracy of the SWTI method.

The results obtained during the second wire tension test, after remeasuring some wires with ambiguous resonance, are summarized in Fig. 7 for each layer and in Fig. 8 for all wires. Actually, all wires for which no or low peak resonance was found, were retested with the Wavetek device.

During this series of measurements, many wires (4.3%) exhibit no resonance. Out of the 132 'lost' wires, 80 had a visible broken connection at the point where the active web is bent to form the outer frame. For the remaining wires, either there is an invisible broken trace, or the wire is perfectly centered in the straw allowing only second harmonics and a resonance of very low, thus undetectable, amplitude. Since during the first test only a few straws had a broken connection, many connections broke during the various tests (straightness test with \({}^{55}\)Fe source, gas flux measurements, etc.) which this module underwent between the two tests. This indicates that special caution has to be taken when handling the active webs in the future.

Out of the seven out-of-spec wires (\(T_{2}<50\) g), during the first test one

was also found loose and five had \(T_{1}<56\,\)g. There is also a wire (wire\(\#29\) of cell\(\#69\)) with very low tension of \(41.1\,\)g (equiv. \(210\,\)Hz). The resonance curve for this wire is shown in Fig. 9. This wire had \(T_{1}=62.6\,\)g (or \(f_{\rm r}=259\,\)Hz) during the first test. This discrepancy can be explained by the existence of a small 'bump'4 on the curve around \(\sim 260\,\)Hz. This could be mistaken as a very low peak resonance in the oscilloscope (Wavetek method), since the frequency scanning usually begins from \(\sim 230\,\)Hz. Therefore, this large difference between the result from the first and second test should not be interpreted as a degradation of the wire tension.

Footnote 4: These very small bumps, which remain undetectable if a non-zero discrimination level were chosen, may be the result of cross-talk between the wires.

The mean values of the \(f_{\rm r}\)- and \(T\)-distributions for the second test are \(\langle f_{\rm r}\rangle=(261.7\pm 0.2)\,\)Hz and \(\langle T\rangle=(63.96\pm 0.08)\,\)g, respectively. It is straightforward hence that there is no observable shift of the mean value of the tension distribution when compared with the one of the first test. A more decisive test, however, will be provided by the statistical analysis of the tension difference between these tests, which is discussed in the next section.

Comparison of the results

### Wire tension difference

In order to investigate a potential degradation of the wire tension with time, the results of the two tests were compared wire by wire. The difference in the wire tension (second minus first test) is illustrated in Fig. 10 for each layer and in Fig. 11 for all wires.

When comparing the results from the two tests, there were many (\(\sim\!60\)) wires which yielded large tension difference, \(|\Delta T|>10\) g. Most of these wires were carefully (with precision '2') and repeatedly retested using the SWTI and the results from the first test were also examined. The following observations were obtained.

* For about 30 wires a resonance was found around the resonant frequency of the first test, and not the one of the second, i.e. the initially observed values could not be reproduced. Most of the 'fake' resonances were found in the low-frequency (\(<250\,\)Hz) or in the high-frequency

Figure 10: _Distributions of the difference in the wire tension at the second test minus the one at the first test for each layer._

(\(>280\) Hz) region. This effect is related to the sensitivity of the device to noise, which produces a single point well above the amplitude baseline, mistaken by the program as a resonance. The possibility for this defect to occur can be minimized by applying a non-zero discrimination level and by increasing the power so that the actual resonance is clearly distinguishable.
* For about 20 wires, the measured tension values were verified and, in some cases, a lower peak was also observed, as shown in Fig. 12. This second resonance is due to cross-talk from neighboring wires which have the same tension.
* The data sheets with the results of the first test mentioned two different resonance values for many wires. For about 15 wires with large \(|\Delta T|\), the frequency which was not taken into account when evaluating \(\Delta T\) was almost equal to the result of the recent test.

After this procedure5, 5 wires with \(\Delta T<-10\) g and 7 wires with \(\Delta T>10\) g remained in the 'tails' of the \(\Delta T\)-distribution. Since they are almost evenly distributed at the negative and positive direction, they do not imply

Figure 11: _Distribution of the difference in the wire tension at the second test minus the one at the first test for all wires_.

a systematic decrease in the wire tension. They can be the result of the mismeasurement of very low amplitude resonances or double resonances during the first test.

The most significant result, however, is that the mean value of the difference is practically equal to zero (\(\langle\Delta T\rangle=(0.00\pm 0.03)\) g), indicating that there is no systematic decrease in the wire tension after a period of \(\sim\)11 months. The same conclusion can also be derived, if one considers the \(\Delta f_{\rm r}\)-distribution, which has a mean value of \(\langle\Delta f_{\rm r}\rangle=(0.00\pm 0.07)\) Hz.

The estimated standard variation of the distribution (1.8 g for full statistics) is greater than the one expected from the repeated measurement of a single wire (see Section 3). This is due to the lower accuracy of the Wavetek method, which was used in the first test and to other possible sources of errors (e.g. saturated resonances, low peaks). The latter reasons are responsible for the tails in the \(\Delta T\)-distribution.

### Possible asymmetry on the difference distribution

The non-degradation of the wire tension can also be checked by examining the possible asymmetry of the frequency/tension distribution of the difference between the two tests. A possible drop of the tension for some wires would manifest itself as a larger dispersion of the \(\Delta f_{\rm r}\)-distribution towards negative values than for positive ones. The resonant frequency is used instead of the tension, because this is the directly observable quantity. For this reason, each of the two sides (positive and negative) of this histogram were fitted with a

## 6 Conclusions

The tension of the wires of the 4-plane TRT module straws was measured twice; at first, just after its assembly and, about 11 months later, using two different devices. From the comparison of the outcomes from the two tests, the following conclusions can be drawn:

* Both the first and second test showed that the tension of the straw tube wires is within the specifications (\(T>50\) g).
* No systematic degradation of the wire tension was observed after almost one year, as deduced from the average tension difference: \(\langle\Delta T\rangle=(0.00\pm 0.03)\) g and from the spread of \(\Delta T\) (\(\sigma=1.8\) g), which is compatible with the reproducibility of the measurements.
* The previous statement is confirmed by the symmetry of the \(\Delta T\)-distribution with respect to the vertical axis, indicating that no significant fraction of the wires exhibits a decreased tension.
* The crimping pins and the wiring procedure can therefore be reliably used for the production of the end-cap TRT wheels.

As far as the instruments and procedure followed for these measurements are concerned, the following comments can be made:

* The technique on which the determination of the tension is based on --acoustic mechanical excitation of the wires without magnetic field--is suitable for the TRT straw tubes.

Figure 13: _Mean value of the tension measured at the second test for wires from 3 cells vs. the cell number (left). Mean value of the tension difference between the two tests for wires from 3 cells vs. the cell number (right). The vertical bars represent the r.m.s. values for the corresponding samples._* The Straw Wire Tension Instrument and the related software package (Wire Tension Measurement Program) provide an automated procedure for simultaneous testing of 32 wires with a precision of 1%. Hence, they can be used for the QC of the ATLAS TRT end-cap wheels.
* The procedure should be further optimised so that no resonance saturations occur. This can be achieved in two ways: either by extending the dynamical range of the SWTI's ADC, or by modifying the excitation of the wires, so that the resonance has almost the same amplitude for all wires.

Another observation made during these measurements is that the part of the web where the Kapton and the signal traces bend, proved to be very sensitive. The connections easily break after being bent several times. The final design for these webs has to assure the mechanical strength of these connections.
