**Problem formulation**

Presently, a set of measurements of magnetic properties of the TileCal steel (absorber plates and girder components) are available. The measurements were performed in two laboratories (CERN and JINR) for various samples of steel (Czech and US ones) and different heat treatments (annealing). The obvious question is raised: what would be the effect of the magnetic property variation, appeared this way, on the TileCal functionality? Is it tolerable or not?

The following manifestation of this magnetic property variation could be looked at:

* _Tile location magnetic field._
* _PMT location magnetic field._
* _Azimuthal variation in the TileCal field map._

**Magnetic property measurement data**

In Figure 1 the latest permeability measurements are shown. Permeability curves for different manufacturing plants and different heat treatments of steel are presented in the Figure. One can notice 3 types of curves in the range of the magnetic induction values from 0.7 T to 1.7 T:

_1.US steel master plates ("usm")_

_2.Czech master and spacer plates ("czm" and "sp95")_

_3.Annealed steel, proposed for the girder fabrication ("a1" and "a2")_

The following questions could be raised in connection with the above mentioned measurement data:

_1. What would be effect of the difference in the permeability of the US steel master plates ("usm") and Czech master plates ("czm") on the tile-location field?_

_2. Apparently, the magnetic properties of the annealed steel, proposed for the girder fabrication ("a1" and "a2"), are worse than that of US-steel and Czech-steel. What would be effect of it on the PMT-location field? Since "a1"-curve and "a2"-curve are practically coincident, it would be sufficient to investigate only, say, "a1"-curve effect._

_3. Azimuthal variation of the field in the sampling region is proportional to the magnetic property variation from a module to another one, situated nearby at different azimuthal positions. Analysis of the relative permeability variation of "usm", "czm" and "sp95"-curves can help in answering this question._

## Results of calculation

### Tile location field

The rather rough 2D computer (R-Z) model, described in Ref.[2], was used for the preliminary simulation of the permeability variation effects (Figure 3). Laminated anisotropy, caused by the 50 \(\mu\) glue gaps and 0.76 packing factor of the absorber region, characterizes the chosen variant of the model. This means that no real tile structure was taken into account, but just averaged material property was assumed.

In Figure 4 the field strength map calculations, based on the model described above and using the OPERA-2D code, is given. Only absorber region is considered there. The absorber region was presented as a laminated Czech steel ("czm"). The girder and other solid iron structure elements were presented as an annealed steel ("a1"). The maximum field strength value within the absorber (H\({}_{\rm life}\)) is of 72 Over in this case (Z=0). This quantity could give (with some degree of approximation) the field value at the tile locations. Replacing the "czm"-steel by the "usm"-steel in the absorber leads to rather small effect ( = 0.3 %) on the H\({}_{\rm life}\)-variation.

More realistic 2D computer model with the real tile structure in the region of interest (Barrel corners at Z=max plane and Z=0 symmetry plane) was also used to get more precise estimation of the considered effects. This model is described in Ref [7] with the latest correction of the anisotropy degree in the sampling region, proposed in Ref. [4]. According to this proposal the relative average permeability in the Z-direction should be \(\mu_{z}=20+30\) instead of \(\mu_{z}=500\), used in the Ref.[5]. This modification will lead to the substantial decreasing of the axial flux, passing through the sampling region, down to = 10 % of the total return flux at Z=0.

The results of calculations, based on the model described above and using the CERN POISCR code, are shown in Figure 5 (Z=max) and Figure 6 (Z=0). The tile location field along two adjacent radial tile columns in the corresponding regions are given in these Figures. One can see in Figure 5 (Z=max), that for the previous level of anisotropy (\(\mu_{z}\approx 500\)) the maximum field value reaches 150 G at Z=max and R=min. In the case of the recently adopted level of anisotropy (\(\mu_{z}\approx 30\)) the maximum tile field goes down to 120 G ("czm") or 95 G ("usm"). The effect even more noticeable near Z=0 (Figure 6), where 210 G field becomes 70 G for both type of steel "czm" and "usm".

Very small difference between "czm" and "usm" types of steel in the Z=0 plane confirms the obtained result with the OPERA-2D model. In the Z=max region this difference amounts to about 25 % at R=min. In general, the tile location field is still below the tolerable level. This conclusion is in a good agreement with the previous simulations6.

### PMT location field

The R-\(\varphi\) computer model, described in Ref. [3], with the modifications, mentioned in the previous section, was used to make an estimation of the PMT-location field for the measured permeability (see Figure 7). In the girder region the "a1"-steel and in the sampling region "czm" or "usm" steel were used in the simulations. The PMT location field defers by about 25 % between "czm" and "usm" types of steel (see Figure 8). But it is below the still tolerable level of 10 G, which is in a good agreement with the conclusion of the previous calculations (see Ref.[6]).

### Field azimuthal variation

It is well known that the azimuthal variation of the TileCal field is proportional to the permeability variation in the various modules. In Figure 9 and Figure 10 the permeability variation in the absorber is given. For the girder there is no experimental data on the permeability variation of the steel proposed for its manufacturing. Although the relative permeability variation for the maximum field strength of the absorber ( = 50 kA/m) is about \(\pm\) 10 %, the maximum permeability variation could reach \(\approx\) 45 % for the lower field strength values. Unfortunately, there is still no firmly defined tolerance on the TileCal azimuthal variation. So, presently it is difficult to say anything, looking on the data, presented in the above mentioned Figures.

## Conclusions

* For the measured B(H) of various sorts of steel, proposed for the absorber and girder manufacturing, there are no problems as far as the B-field level at the PMT and tile location concerned.
* The effects of nonzero "coercive force" H\({}_{\mathrm{c}}\) and connected with it residual magnetization ("remanent field") of the calorimeter iron are still to be investigated for the TileCal functionality.
