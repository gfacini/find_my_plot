ABSTRACT

The detector - front end system is considered, taken into account detector (capacitance) properties, electronics noise performance and radiation induced leakage current in ten years LHC operation. Conclusions are drawn on optimal detector geometries and electronics requirements.

Introduction

The basic assumption is that all detectors should survive 10 years operation with sufficiently high signal to noise ratio, so as to allow low enough signal thresholds in order to guarantee nearly 100% efficiency without drowning in noise hits.

In the following an estimate of the most likely and minimum signals to be expected from a 300\(\mu m\) detector is given, the maximum threshold for 100% efficiency and the maximum tolerable noise is estimated. This is done for two cases: a) capacitive charge division readout b) individual strip readout

All numbers quoted are only approximate a more precise investigation and perhaps monte carlo simulation should follow this first attempt.

## 2 Signal and thresholds

The most probable m.i.p. signal of a 300\(\mu m\) silicon detector is approximately 22000 electrons. Landau fluctuations go down to \(\approx\)75% and an additional 20% should be subtracted for ballistic deficit and trapping after irradiation. We are therefore left with 13200 electrons which we want to measure even if they are distributed between two neighbouring readout channels (strips). This distribution occurs for both charge division readout and individual strip readout due to diffusion of charge carriers during collection and - more important - due to track inclination.

a) charge division readout

an additonal loss of roughly 20% is expected for signals distributed evenly between neighbouring strips so that for this worst case (including Landau down fluctuation) 10560 electrons are left so that we have \(Q_{min}^{strip}=5280e\) and \(Q_{min}^{clust}=10560e\).

For charge division readout two thresholds should be set: a individual strip threshold \(Q_{thr}^{strip}\) and a cluster threshold \(Q_{thr}^{clust}\). These thresholds should be set at least two \(\sigma_{noise}\) below the expected minimum signals

\[Q_{thr}^{strip} = Q_{min}^{strip}-2\sigma_{noise}^{strip} \tag{1}\] \[Q_{thr}^{clust} = Q_{min}^{clust}-2\sigma_{noise}^{clust}\]

The noise has essentially two contributions, one originating from the detector reverse bias current, the other from the electronics (usually dominated by serial noise). We will not go into more detail here except of pointing out that the detector current generated noise is proportional to the square root of the shaping time constant and does not lead to correlations between neighbouring channels. The amplifier serial noise parameterized as

\[Q_{noise}^{amp}=Q_{noise,0}^{amp}+U_{noise}^{amp}C_{det} \tag{2}\]

with \(C_{det}\) the total capacitance at the amplifier input, does lead to noise correlations as \(U_{noise}^{amp}\) appears at the amplifier input and feeds through the detector capacitive network noise charge into the neighbouring channels. Only the capacitance dependent part of the amplifier noise leads to correlation. The noise charge \(Q_{noise}^{corr}=U_{noise}^{amp}C_{det}\) is roughly split in two (as long as strip-strip capacitances dominate strongly over strip-ground capacitance) and fed with opposite sign into the neighbouring channels.

Considering the cluster noise charge of a two strip cluster we have in the absence of noise correlation

\[Q_{noise}^{clust}=Q_{noise}^{seq}\sqrt{2}\quad\textit{intheabsence of noise correlation} \tag{3}\]

with \(Q_{noise}^{seq}\) the noise charge corresponding to the total capacitive load of a strip connected to the amplifier input. In the other extreme of full correlation four amplifiers contribute to the noise and one obtains

\[Q_{noise}^{clust}=Q_{noise}^{seq}\sqrt{(\frac{1}{2})^{2}+(\frac{1}{2})^{2}+( \frac{1}{2})^{2}+(\frac{1}{2})^{2}}=Q_{noise}^{seq}\quad\textit{for completeness correlation} \tag{4}\]

This result comes from the fact that the noise charge introduced into the neighbouring channel has half size and opposite sign of the proper noise charge [1]. For partial noise correlation one has

\[Q_{noise}^{clust}=\sqrt{2}\sqrt{(f\cdot Q_{noise}^{corr})^{2}+(Q_{noise}^{ cap}-f\cdot Q_{noise}^{corr})^{2}}\quad\textit{for}\,\textit{partial noise correlation} \tag{5}\]

where \(f<0.5\) is the ratio of strip to strip over total strip capacitances.

Single strip noise is also influenced by noise correlation. In the absence of noise correlation one has

\[Q_{noise}^{strip}=Q_{noise}^{seq}\quad\textit{inthe absence of noise correlation} \tag{6}\]

In the case of complete correlation three strips contribute with weights \(\frac{1}{2}\), \(1\), and \(\frac{1}{2}\) and obtains

\[Q_{noise}^{strip}=Q_{noise}^{seq}\sqrt{(\frac{1}{2})^{2}+1+(\frac{1}{2})^{2} }=\sqrt{1.5}\,Q_{noise}^{seq}\quad\textit{for completeness correlation} \tag{7}\]

and for partial correlation

\[Q_{noise}^{strip}=\sqrt{(f\cdot Q_{noise}^{corr})^{2}+(Q_{noise}^{seq})^{2}+ (f\cdot Q_{noise}^{corr})^{2}}\quad\textit{for partial noise correlation} \tag{8}\]

Noise correlation does lead to an increase of single strip noise and to a reduction of cluster noise.

Comparing two strip cluster noise with single strip noise one finds

\[Q_{noise}^{clust}=\sqrt{2}\,Q_{noise}^{strip}\quad\textit{in the absence of noise correlation}\]

\[Q_{noise}^{clust}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{1.5}}\,Q_{noise}^{strip}\quad\textit{for complete noise correlation}\]

a slightly surprising result, as the cluster noise can for strong correlation be smaller than the single strip noise. The result of partial correlations is in between the two values.

For weak noise correlation equations 5 and 7 can be approximated as

\[Q_{noise}^{clust} \approx \sqrt{2}\,(Q_{noise}^{seq}-f\cdot Q_{noise}^{corr}) \tag{9}\] \[Q_{noise}^{strip} \approx Q_{noise}^{seq} \tag{10}\]

where \(f<0.5\) is the ratio of strip to strip over total strip capacitances.

**b) individual strip readout**

Here it is assumed that cluster logic is not applied - although it would in principle be possible - and a single threshold per strip is applied. The minimum signal charge is higher due to avoidance of charge loss from the floating strips. One obtains \(Q_{min}^{trip}=13200/2\,e=6600\,e\) and is able to set the threshold to

\[Q_{thr}=Q_{min}^{trip}-2\sigma_{noise}^{strip} \tag{11}\]Noise limits

In estimating the tolerable noise we will require that less than 10\({}^{-4}\) of the readout channels will provide a noise hit. This corresponds to the requirement that noise is below one quarter of the relevant threshold (cluster threshold for charge division readout and strip threshold for individual strip readout). As we have set the threshold already two sigmas below the minimum cluster respectively strip charge the maximum tolerable noise is one sixth of the minimum cluster respectively strip charge.

### Conservative limits

**a) charge division**

The determining quantity is the cluster. The limit on cluster noise charge is

\[Q_{noise}^{clut}<\frac{1}{6}Q_{min}^{clut}=10560/6\,e=1760\,e\]

For the strip thresholdless stringent criteria can be tolerated. If we assume the threshold to be at two sigma the limit for the strip noise is

\[Q_{noise}^{strip}=\frac{1}{4}Q_{min}^{strip}=5280/4\,e=1320\,e\]

**b) individual strip readout**

Here the limit on the strip noise is

\[Q_{noise}=\frac{1}{6}Q_{min}^{strip}=6600/6\,e=1100\,e\]

### Relaxed limits

These noise limits may be considered extremely conservative in the sense that 100% efficiency is required also for the rare most pessimistic case of charge division, downward Landau fluctuation and negative noise fluctuation. It should be seen however that no reserve for individual baseline variation for common mode noise individual channel theshold variations and other system problems has been provided for. Being somewhat optimistic one may reduce the ratio between minimum signal and noise from 6 to 5 and from 4 to 3 for strips when cluster thresholds are applied. With these assumptions one has for

**a) charge division**

\[Q_{noise}^{clut}<\frac{1}{5}Q_{min}^{clut}=10560/5\,e=2112\,e\]

\[Q_{noise}^{strip}=\frac{1}{3}Q_{min}^{strip}=5280/3\,e=1760\,e\]

**b) individual strip readout**

\[Q_{noise}=\frac{1}{5}Q_{min}^{strip}=6600/5\,e=1320\,e\]Consequences for detector layout

Noise will be produced on the one hand by the detector leakage current, caused mainly by radiation damage and on the other hand by the amplifier noise which is strongly dependent on the detector capacitive load.

While the detector leakage current is simply proportional to the area (strip length \(\times\) readout pitch) of the detector and does not produce noise correlation between neighbouring channels, detector capacitance and therefore amplifier noise has a complicated dependence on detector geometry and is in particular rather different for charge division and individual strip readout.

The situation is in fact rather more complicated than expected at first glance.

Detector leakage current has a strong temperature dependence and the leakage current is not simply proportional to the irradiation dose but depends in addition on the time and temperature dependent (self) annealing.

Scaling laws for radiation damage induced reverse bias currents have been developed. They will be used when estimating limits for the detector area connected to a readout channel in the following section.

The dependence of capacitances on geometry, radiation damage and operating conditions is completely understood although somewhat lengthy to describe. We will therefore summarize here only a few essential points which limit the options of making interstrip capacitances very small. For simplicity these comments are made only for p-strips on n- or (after inversion) p-type silicon.

* The region between strips (naked oxide on top of silicon) is rather delicate to deal with. It behaves like an MOS structure with the conductor potential (outer oxide surface) determined by the neighbouring electrodes (aluminum strips). This has been observed with non irradiated detectors and is due to the extremely good insulation properties of silicon dioxide. It still has to be proven for detectors after irradiation.
* The oxide charge which increases strongly with irradiation will in many conditions generate an electron accumulation (or inversion) layer which increases strip to strip capacitance.
* Increasing the gap and narrowing the strips with the intention of reducing strip strip capacitance is dangerous as the effect of capacitance reduction is coupled with a potential change of the \(Si-SiO_{2}\) surface and a dangerous increase of the electric field strength at the strip edges. It in addition leads to an increase of the voltage required for full depletion.
* in case of capacitive charge division reduction of capacitive load should rather be attempted by increasing the number of floating strips than by increasing the gap.
* especially after irradiation.
* For capacitively coupled detectors the electronics should be operated close to (implanted) strip potential in order to avoid a strong increase of the electron layer surface charge density and electric field strength as well as capacitance increase. Running the electronics on a positive voltage with respect to strip implants has the same effect as increasing the oxide charge.
* Capacitive coupling of readout in principle offers the possibility of compensating the radiation induced buildup of oxide charge by a negative shift of the electronics (ground) voltage relative to the implanted strip voltage (as long as the damage is spacially uniform).

Above statements are the results of simulations which (as far as checked) agree with measured data. Quantification of these statements and prediction of detector properties after irradiation from changes in material properties is possible with the simulation tools available.

## 5 Choosing the detector geometry

In chosing the detector geometry one has to balance the leakage current noise with the capacitance dependent amplifier noise while keeping in addition the measurement precision good enough. The way this will be attempted is to first determine the maximum detector area which keeps the leakage current noise below the tolerable value. In doing so we pretend that leakage current is the sole noise source present.

We then go to the opposite extreme and consider amplifier noise alone. There the capacitive properties for readout pitches of 100 and 200 \(\mu m\) with and without capacitive charge division will be considered. Assuming electronic noise properties the maximum strip length (and therefore also detector area) compatible with the noise requirements will be determined.

As a final step leakage current and amplifier noise will be considered together and a compromise will be chosen.

### Maximum area (strip length \(\times\) readout pitch)

Operation at 20\({}^{\circ}\)C, 10\({}^{\circ}\)C, 5\({}^{\circ}\)C and 0\({}^{\circ}\)C will be considered: Intermediate warm up periods - as will be shown - hardly affect the leakage current under LHC operation conditions.

In the following an estimate of the volume generated current due to radiation damage for the four scenarios will be attempted on the basis of a parameterization given by H. Feick [3] and by E. Fretwurst [2].

The present best understanding is the following: The volume generated current after a short irradiation with fluence \(\Phi\) and annealing time \(t\) at reference (room) temperature \(T_{R}\) is given by

\[\frac{\triangle I}{Vol}=\alpha\cdot\Phi\cdot g(t) \tag{12}\]

with \(\alpha\) the damage constant and \(g(t)\) the annealing function at reference (room) temperature chosen to be 20\({}^{\circ}C\). The annealing function can be parameterized a sum of exponential time dependences each applying to a fraction \(a_{i}\) of the initial damage.

\[g(t)=\sum_{i}a_{i}\cdot exp\left(-\frac{t}{\tau_{i}}\right)\quad with\quad \sum a_{i}=1 \tag{13}\]

The fractions and time constants at 20\({}^{\circ}C\) for a type inverted wafer are given in table 1. Five components have been measured so far with time scales ranging from minutes to days, and a fraction of 25% remains stable at present measurment precision.

Annealing and current have both very strong temperature dependence. The ratio of currents at two temperatures is given by

\[R^{-1}(T)=\frac{\triangle I(T)}{\triangle I(T_{R})}=\left(\frac{T}{T_{R}}\right)^ {2}exp\left(\frac{E_{G}}{2k_{B}}\left[\frac{1}{T_{R}}-\frac{1}{T}\right]\right) \tag{14}\]

which corresponds to a change of about a factor 2 every \(7.5^{0}C\). The value of \(E_{G}\) was experimentally determined to \(1.24\pm 0.06eV\)[3]. The perhaps oversimplified assumption is a unique time scaling of all damage fractions by the same factor

\[\tau_{i}(T)=\tau_{i}(T_{R})\Theta(T)\;\;\;with\;\;\;\Theta(T)=exp\left(\frac{E _{Iann}}{k_{B}}\left[\frac{1}{T_{R}}-\frac{1}{T}\right]\right) \tag{15}\]

corresponding to a time streching of factor 2 every \(4.7^{0}C\) cooling when taking \(E_{Iann}=1.09eV\)[3].

Notice that the (cold) temperature for detector operation in which the currents are important may be different from the temperature in periods in which most of the annealing occurs.

Compared to a ten year operation period all annealing time constants are short at \(20^{0}C\) so that we can consider the constant damage fraction only and use the infinite time damage constant:

\[\alpha_{\infty}=\alpha\cdot a_{5}=(2.86\pm 0.95)10^{-17}A/cm\;\;\;\;for1MeV neutrons\]

At the lowest considered temperature of \(0^{0}C\) the largest time constant is still a small fraction of a year so that also here we are only concerned with the 25% stable damage.

Results on the volume generated leakage current after irradiation are given as function of the radius in table 2.

It remains to determine the current limit from noise consideration in which we make the preliminary assumption that current noise is the only contribution. The shot noise after charge amplification and RCCR filtering with time constant \(\tau\) is

\[Q_{I,noise}=\sqrt{2\cdot q\cdot I\cdot\tau} \tag{16}\]

so that the limit on the current is

\[I<\frac{\left(Q_{noise}^{max}\right)^{2}}{2\cdot q\cdot\tau} \tag{17}\]

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|} \hline relative & time constant \\ amplitude & at \(20^{0}C\) \\ \(a_{i}\) & \(\tau_{i}\) [min] \\ \hline

For the two cases considered one obtains

**a) charge division**

The relevant limit is the maximum cluster noise charge which for the uncorrelated current noise is \(\sqrt{2}\) times the single channel noise so that

\[Q_{noise}^{max}=Q_{noise}^{test}/\sqrt{2}=\frac{1760q}{\sqrt{2}}=1245q\]

so that

\[I<\frac{1245^{\cdot}1.6\,10^{-10}}{2\tau}=\frac{1.24\,10^{-13}}{\tau}\qquad I [\mu A]<\frac{124}{\tau[ns]}\]

With \(\tau=25ns\) this corresponds to 5\(\mu\)A which has to be compared to the 2\(\mu\)A value chosen in table 2.

With \(\tau=25ns\) this corresponds to 4\(\mu\)A which has to be compared to the 2\(\mu\)A value chosen in table 2.

### Maximum strip length (from capacitive load)

Two amplifier performances and one recommendation will be considered:

\begin{table} \end{table}
Table 2: leakage current and detector area cooresponding to 2\(\mu\)A reverse bias current of a 300\(\mu\)m thick detector after ten years operation at LHC at various radial distances* ADAM chip with NICON front end \[ENC = 800+80C_{D}(pF)\]
* FELIX chip after deconvolution \[ENC = 540+77.3C_{D}(pF)\]
* ID electronics review panel recommendation \[ENC = 700+70C_{D}(pF)\]

The noise values are taken from P. Jarrons review [4]

Capacitances for 100 and 200 \(\mu m\) readout pitch with 0,1,2,3 floating strips will be calculated, gap width kept in such a condition that loss to ground is below 20% and that electric fields stay reasonable low. Capacitances are calculated with the TOSCA program [5]. The calculation is exact in the sense that capacitances between all pairs of conductors have been included and the simulation region has been chosen much larger than the readout pitch. The (optimistic) underlaying assumption that the region between strips is free of inversion or accumulation layers is right only with proper operation conditions of the detector and can be influenced severely by radiation damage.

Results of these calculations are summarized in table 3. There the gap between strips has been chosen 10\(\mu\)m and absence of accumulation and inversion layers in between strips below the uncovered oxide has been assumed. Such a condition - which leads to low capacitance values and low electric fields - can be reached in capacitively coupled detectors by proper choice of the voltage between implanted strips and electronics input potential. It can even be maintained during and after spacially uniform radiation exposure if this voltage difference is continuously adjusted to the flat band voltage shift of the detector. For directly coupled detectors this adjustment is not possible.

We turn now to the question of maximum strip length respectively capacitive load. Here for the moment the noise from the detector current will be neglected. We will calculate the maximum capacitive load on a single channel for the two amplifier specifications and the two readout modes. In view of the rather high noise pedestals of the two amplifier options we will neglect noise correlations for this rough estimate.

a) charge division

From the maximum cluster noise we tolerate a factor \(\sqrt{(}2)\) smaller noise of the amplifier connected to a capacitor equivalent to the total strip capacitance:

\[Q_{noise}^{cap}<\frac{1760}{\sqrt{2}\,e}=1245\,e\]

The total tolerable capacitive load to the electronics channel is for our conservative noise limits

\[C_{t}<\frac{1245-800}{80}=5.6pF\quad\,for\,amplifier\,type\,A\]

\[C_{t}<\frac{1245-540}{77.3}=9.1pF\quad\,for\,amplifier\,type\,B\]\[C_{t}<\frac{1245-700}{70}=7.8pF\quad\quad for\;amplifier\;type\;C\]

For the relaxed noise limits one obtains similarly: \(C_{t}<8.7pF\) (ampl. A), \(C_{t}<12.3pF\) (ampl. B), \(C_{t}<11.3pF\) (ampl. C).

The maximum strip length corresponding to these values are compiled in table 3.

**b) individual strip readout**

In the absence of noise correlation the single strip noise equals the equivalent capacitor noise so that we have for our conservative noise limits

\[Q_{noise}^{gap}<1100\;e\]

The total tolerable capacitive load to the electronics channel is

\[C_{t}<\frac{1100-800}{80}=3.8pF\quad\quad for\;amplifier\;type\;A\]

\[C_{t}<\frac{1100-540}{77.3}=7.8pF\quad\quad for\;amplifier\;type\;B\]

\[C_{t}<\frac{1100-700}{70}=5.7pF\quad\quad for\;amplifier\;type\;C\]

For the relaxed noise limits one obtains similarly: \(C_{t}<6.5pF\) (ampl. A), \(C_{t}<10.1pF\) (ampl. B), \(C_{t}<8.9pF\) (ampl. C).

The maximum strip length corresponding to these values are compiled in table 3.

Considering table 3 one notices that for reasonable strip length all examples considered hardly fulfill the aims originally stated. The two examples coming closest are \(100\mu m\) readout pitch with one charge division strip and \(200\mu m\) pitch with two charge division strips.

## 6 Noise in'standard' strip detector geometries

We will now start from the other end and choose some'standard' strip detector geometries, calculate the noise with presently forseen electronics performance and compare the system performance with our requirements. From this comparison some recommendations for detectors and electronics developments will be made.

We take from table 3 the two most reasonable geometries of \(200\mu m\) readout pitch with 2 charge division strips and \(100\mu m\) readout pitch with one charge division strip. Although the total strip capacitance per unit length is higher for the \(100\mu m\) readout we will use 12 cm strip length in the \(100\mu m\) case and 6 cm in the \(200\mu m\) readout example so as to keep the electronic channel count equal.

We in addition will consider \(75\mu m\) binary readout with 12 cm strip length which also satisfies the \(20\mu m\) spatial resolution requirement. 10, 20, 30 and 40 \(\mu m\) gap widths are considered for this case. In principle the capacitive load could be reduced further by increasing the gap width. However this brings the disadvantage of increasing significantly the depletion voltage and the danger of electrical breakdown, especially when the oxide charge is increased due to radiation damage.

Additional examples of amplifier performances with bipolar input stages will be included. The noise performance of all amplifier examples are given in table 4.

Contrary to table 3 we will take noise correlation into account. Assumptions and results on strip and cluster noise are summarized in table 5.

Added in quadrature to these noise values should be the leakage current noise after ten years of LHC operation. This noise is strongly dependent on the radial position of the detector. From table 3 and equation 16 we find at r=30 cm and 0\({}^{0}\)C \(I_{strip}=\frac{2\cdot 12}{10.7}=2.24\mu A\) giving a strip noise of 837 e and a cluster noise of 1183 e. At r=52 cm the corresponding values at same temperature are \(I_{strip}=1.02\mu A\), strip noise 565 e and cluster noise 799 e.

These values should be added in quadrature to the noise values of table 5. Alternatively they can be subtracted from the noise limits in section 3 in order to obtain the limits on electronics noise which are given in table 6 for some selected conditions.

## 7 Conclusion

Requiring simultaneously low noise rate and high efficiency even in the case of equal charge deviation between two neighbouring channels leads to rather high demands on electronics noise performance.

This is true for both analog readout and even more for binary readout, as in the latter case setting of a off-line cluster threshold is impossible.

Meeting the demands on efficiency and noise hit suppression, position measurement precision 'comes for free' with analog readout in capacitive charge division. However nearest neighbour readout logic must be implemented.

Presently planned electronics noise performance is insufficient for the use of 12cm long strips at all radii if our stringent noise limits are to be obeyed. This is also true for the electronics review panel recommendation of \(ENC<700+70C_{D}[pF]\).

We therefore will be forced to accept some inefficiencies and/or put some effort to increase noise performance of the electronics.

Implementation of cluster threshold logic would decrease the noise performance requirements on the front end amplifier.

It is therefore recommended to use shorter (\(\approx 6\) cm length) strips and rather wide (150 to 200 \(\mu\)m) readout pitch with capacitive charge division.

Electronics performance should be improved nevertheless. This concerns not only noise performance but also the implementation of

* possibilities for common mode subtraction
* possibilities for setting a cluster threshold

Shortening the strip length to single wafer size would avoid the wafer to wafer strip bonding and at the same time naturally allow z-overlap, respectively continuous solid angle coverage.
