**Abstract:**

In this note, we present the result s of studies on reconstruction efficiency of single muons. The results are given for three or four layers of tubes per multilayer in MDT chambers. The comparison is based on the robustness of the reconstruction efficiency against degradation of chamber performance or detector operating conditions.

Introduction

In the ATLAS Technical Proposal [1], the number of layers per multilayers in MDT chambers was not fixed. The choice between three or four layers was postponed awaiting further studies on pattern recognition and autocalibration.

In this note, we present the reconstruction efficiency from large samples of single muons simulated in the ATLAS muon spectrometer in the 3-layer or 4-layer options. Results are given as a function of the following parameters: noise level, tube efficiency, trigger chamber efficiency, intrinsic tube resolution and tube dead time.

## 2 Technical aspects

### Simulation and Reconstruction

We have used a sample of 10,000 single muons of both signs uniformly distributed in azimuthal angle, in pseudorapidily \(|\eta|<2.8\) and in momentum from 5 GeV to 300 GeV. The simulation of these single muons in muon spectrometer have been performed using a GEANT simulation where the muon chambers are replaced by "phantom chambers", i.e. a set of aluminium plates placed close to the real muon chambers 1. The simulation of muon chamber hits from the "phantom chamber" hits ("digitization") with additional hits produced by noise and the tracks reconstruction are performed by the module of the ATLAS reconstruction program, MUONBOX, used in its standalone mode [2].

Footnote 1: More precisely, a “phantom chamber” is a set of four “sensitive” Aluminium plates of 1 mm thickness spaced by 6, 20 and 6 cm in a matrix of “diluted” Aluminium (density divided by 39) of 50 cm thickness. The track parameters of particles passing through the “sensitive” Aluminium plates are stored and latter used in the “digitization” step to build the hits in tubes. Despite that the simulation of secondary particles would have beeing more precise in a full simulation of muons chambers, the use of “phantom chambers” allows realistic quantitative comparaisons

This procedure allows for a substantial reduction of the statistical fluctuations which would appear between two full simulations corresponding, for example, to two different geometries. Futhermore it allows to change in a very simple and fast way the parameters of the simulation: number of tube layers in multilayers, intrinsic tube resolution, alignment errors, tube and trigger chamber efficiencies, tube deadtime, tube diameter, number of trigger chambers, spacer size in MDT chambers and noise level. This flexibility make it possible to perform these studies efficiently and rapidly 2.

Footnote 2: However it must be noticed that about 15.000 normalised CPU hours on the Basta system at the Lyon CCPN computer center were necessary for these studies

### Definitions of track and event quality

In order to quantify the quality of a given track, we consider two quantities:

- the track quality ratio, \(\rho_{Q}\), defined as the ratio of the number of true hits, i.e hits belonging to the muon, used to build the track on the total number of hits used

- the fit quality factor of the track, \(f_{Q}\), as determined by the reconstruction program [2].

A "good" event is defined as an event in which there is a reconstructed track such that:

i/ \(\rho_{Q}\)\(>\) 0.5

ii/ \(f_{Q}\)\(<\) 100

iii/ the reconstructed sign is the same as the generated muon

iv/ the reconstructed momentum differs from the momentum of the generated muon by less than 50 %

### Definition of reconstruction efficiency

In order to remove from the reconstruction efficiency all acceptance effects, we define "ideal" conditions: tube and trigger chamber efficiencies set to 100 % and no added noise 3. Futhermore we remove all hits belonging to secondary particles like electrons. In these conditions, inefficiencies should be exclusively of geometrical origin. With these conditions, we perform two simulations: one in the 3-layer option and one in the 4-layer option. Then we restrict our studies to the sample of events in which the generated muon is reconstructed in these two simulations. For any simulations in any conditions, the reconstruction efficiency is defined as the ratio of the number of "good" events and the total number of events in our working sample.

Footnote 3: All the other parameters of the simulation are those of the ATLAS Technical Proposal. In particular, we took for the intrinsic tube resolution the “standard’ value of \(75\,\mu m\) and for the dead time the “stand’ value of \(80\,ns\). In the rest of this note, except when explicitly mentionned, the intrinsic tube resolution and the dead time were set to these standard values.

### Remarks on reconstruction efficiency in "ideal" conditions

It must be stressed that, in the above definition, the geometrical inefficiencies have been removed by the definition of the working sample. Then, in a second step and for a given configuration, we remove unreconstructed or badly reconstructed events. Since we used a finite tube intrinsic resolution (\(75\,\mu m\)) in "ideal" conditions, it could happen that for few events the reconstructed momentum is very far from the generated one. This happens essentially in the transition region because of the complicated field configuration in this detector part. A direct consequence is that the reconstruction efficiency is not 100% in "ideal" conditions as this appears on plots shown below. However this effect is very small since this efficiency is about 99.9%. Despite it weakness, this effect is real since it reflects the sensitivity of the reconstruction in the transition region which will be illustrated below by the study of the influence of change of tube instinsic resolution.

## 3 Results

The general principle of these studies has been to perform two sets of simulations in the two options and to compare their performances. To investigate the influence of one simulation parameter on the reconstruction efficiency, simulations have been made by varying this parameter around its "standard" value and by keeping all other parameters fixed at their "standard" values.

### Dependence on kinematics

We first studied the reconstruction efficiency as a function of the pseudorapidity \(\eta\), of the muon energy \(E\) and of the azimuthal angle \(\varphi\). The conditions have been set to the "realistic" values: 98% for the tube efficiency, 96% for the trigger chambers efficiency and 5 times the nominal value [1] for the noise level. The results are shown in figure 1.

It clearly appears that the redundancy of the 4-layer option leads to a higher efficiency than the 3-layer option. Typically the efficiency obtained in the 3-layer option is 2.5% lower. Furthermore the amplitudes of the variations are more important in this option. In particular, the dependence of the reconstruction efficiency with respect to \(\eta\) and \(\varphi\) reflects the geometrical non uniformity of the muon chambers system itself. The redundancy of the 4-layer option allows for a smoother variation in \(\eta\) and \(\varphi\).

Thus, with respect to the uniformity of the reconstruction efficiency, the 4-layer option is clearly better than the 3-layer option.

### Influence of Noise Level

The estimation of the level of background in the muon system suffers from several uncertainties. An overall uncertainty of at least a factor two in the nominal noise determined in the ATLAS Technical Proposal, was found to be reasonnable [1]. In order to study the influence of the noise level on the reconstruction efficiency, we performed simulations by setting the tube efficiency to 98%, the trigger chamber efficiency to 96% and by varying the noise level from 0 to 10 times the nominal noise. The results of these studies are shown in figure 2 for the full region \(|\eta|\in[0,2.4]\) and in figure 3 for the barrel region, \(|\eta|\in[0,1.1]\), for the transition region, \(|\eta|\in[1.1,1.7]\), and for the end cap region, \(|\eta|\in[1.7,2.4]\). For comparaison, the reconstruction efficiencies in "ideal conditions" are also shown in figure 2.

One sees that, despite the large interval of noise level covered, the efficiency does not vary too much. In particular, in the end cap region, where the noise rate is relativly higher than in the rest of the muon system, the efficiency does not decrease dramatically. The efficiency is larger and closer to the "ideal conditions" efficiency for the 4-layer option than for the 3-layer option. However as far as the stability against an increase of the background noise is concerned, the two options have comparable performances.

### Influence of Tube Efficiency

For many reasons, e.g. different tube operating conditions, the tube efficiency can change significantly. To study the influence of tube efficiency, we performed simulations by setting the trigger chamber efficiency to 96%, the noise level to 5 times the nominal value and by varying the tube efficiency from 95% to 100%. The results are shown in figure 4 and in figure 5 for the different regions.

As expected, the 4-layer option leads to a reconstruction efficiency higher, always closer to the "ideal conditions" and, more important, much more stable. In the covered range of tube efficiency, the reconstruction efficiency varies by about 1.5% in the 4-layer option while it varies by about 4.5% in the 3-layer option. These variations are similar in all \(\eta\) ranges (figure 5).

The 4-layer option is thus more robust against tube efficiency degradation than the 3-layer option.

### Influence of Trigger Chamber Efficiency

An other component which has an important impact on the reconstruction efficiency is the trigger chamber system. To study the influence of the trigger chamber efficiency, we performed simulations by setting the tube efficiency to 98%, the noise level to 5 times the nominal value and by varying the trigger chamber efficiency from 92% to 100%. The results are shown in figure 6 and in figure 7 for the different regions.

One notes that the reconstruction efficiency depends strongly on the trigger chamber efficiency in all \(\eta\) ranges. This dependence is stronger than the dependence on tube efficiency if the trigger chamber efficiency is lower than its "standard" value of 96%: for a decrease of 2% of \(\epsilon_{trig.}\), the reconstruction efficiency drops by about 4%, i.e 2 times more than for a similar decrease of \(\epsilon_{tube}\). This sensitivity is strongly related to the parameters of the pattern recognition algorithm. Some looser setting would allow to recover a higher efficiency. But the price would be an increase of the fake track rate since the trigger chamber hits are a powerful way to reject noisy hits in the precision chambers. The tuning of parameters in the pattern recognition algorithm is however beyond the scope of this analysis 4.

Footnote 4: In the present studies we worked with similar rejection rates in all the different configurations. In a coming dedicated note, we will study the variations of reconstruction efficiency w.r.t. the fake tracks rate when the internal parameters of the pattern recognition algorithm are changed

One concludes that, with respect to the dependence of the reconstruction efficiency on the trigger chamber efficiency, the 4-layer option is clearly prefered to the 3-layer option.

### Influence of Intrinsic Tube Resolution

The intrinsic tube resolution is strongly dependent on the tube operating conditions. To study the influence of intrinsic tube resolution on the reconstruction efficiency, we performed simulations by setting the tube efficiency to 98%, the trigger chamber efficiency to 96%, the noise level to 5 times the nominal value and by varying the tube resolution from its "standard" value of 75\(\mu m\) to 175\(\mu m\). The results are shown in figure 8 and in figure 9 for the different regions.

From these figures, one sees that, integrated over the full \(\eta\) range, the dependence on tube resolution is small. However while the reconstruction efficiency is almost in dependent on tube resolution in the barrel and end cap regions, it drops by about 4% over the covered range of \(\sigma_{tube}\) values in the transition region. This illustrates that, the spatial resolution is a crucial parameter in the transition region where the muons trajectories are more complicated.

Therefore, considering the robustness against a degradation of the tube resolution, the 4-layer option is better, but only in the transition region.

### Influence of Dead time

The effective dead time after a given signal will strongly depend on the tube operating conditions and on the electronics. It could turn out to be impossible to maintain the multihit capability of the MDT tubes. We have thus investigate the robustness of the reconstruction efficiency against an increase of the dead time.

#### 3.6.1 Model of hits generation

Since the final electronics is not chosen yet, we must first give some details on the model for generation of hits that we had to assume in our analysis. For a track crossing the system of muons chambers at a given time \(t_{0}\), we compute for each crossed tube, the distance of closest approach to the tube wire. From this distance, we compute the time at which the ionization charge arrives on the wire. Obviously this time lies in the time interval \([t_{0},t_{0}+t_{\varphi;\,if}^{\,max}]\) where \(t_{\varphi;\,if}^{\,max}\) is the maximal time of drift. Then we add noise hits according to the noise flux rate. Since the noise is uncorrelated to bunches crossing, these hits can appear at any time with respect to \(t_{0}\) and in particular before \(t_{0}\). At this stage we have generated a time sequence of hits on the tube wire (cf figure 10 a). The effect of dead time \(t_{\mathit{dead}}\) has been modeled as follows (cf figure 10 b). Taking the time sequence of hits on a given wire tube and starting from the earliest of these hits produced at time \(\tau_{0}\), we remove any following hit produced at a latter time \(\tau_{i}\), if \(\tau_{i}=\tau_{0}\) is less than \(t_{\mathit{dead}}\). When this first removal is done, we repeat the procedure whith the second in time of the surviving hits. The output of the tube device is then a time sequence of surviving hits on the tube wire.

Afterwards the difference between the time of a given hit and the time \(t_{0}\), supposed to be known by other means, is converted in distance from wire. It's clear that only those hits which appear after \(t_{0}\) can have a geometrical meaning. In all the preceding studies, we generated noise hits only in the time interval \([t_{0},t_{0}+t_{\varphi;\,if}^{\,max}]\). This means that we neglected the possibility that the noise hits before \(t_{0}\) can hide the hits after \(t_{0}\). Since we now want to study the effect of an increase of the dead time, this is clearly not realistic. For the following study, we have generate noise hits in the enlarged time interval \([t_{0}-t_{\mathit{dead}},t_{0}+t_{\varphi;\,if}^{\,max}]\)5.

Footnote 5: For \(t_{\mathit{dead}}=0\), there is of course no difference between this modified scheme and the one used for the preceding studies. For few relevants points, we have check that the differences between the two schemes for \(t_{\mathit{dead}}=80ns\) are very small and thus that the results of the preceding studies and our conclusions remain valid in this more realistic scheme.

#### 3.6.2 Results

In order to study the effect of an increase of the dead time on the reconstruction efficiency, we performed simulations in the scheme described above, by setting the tube resolution to \(75\mu m\), the tube efficiency to \(98\%\), the trigger chamber efficiency to \(96\%\) the noise level to \(5\) times the nominal value and by varying the tube dead time from \(80\) ns (its "standard" value) to \(880\) ns. The results are shown in figures 11, 12, 13 and 14 for the different regions.

There are three types of hits in our simulations: the noise hits, the hits belonging to the muon and the hits belonging to the showering secondary particles produced by the muon in the different materials. It's interesting, at least as reference point, to know the reconstruction efficiency that we get if we remove all noise hits and hits belonging to the showering particles. This reconstruction efficiency is shown in the figure 11 by the stars. Of course, there is no dependence on dead time in this case.

Then in order to know the effect of the showering particles, we compute the reconstruction efficiency obtained if only the noise hits are removed. This efficiency is shownin the figure 11 by the circles. One sees that the effect of these hits is small. Since the secondary tracks are very close to the muon track, their maximal effect is almost reached already for small values of dead time and the dependence on this parameter is small on the cover range.

Then we compute the reconstruction efficiency obtained if all the hits are included. The resulting efficiency is shown by the squares in figure 11. One sees that the 4-layer option is much less sensitive to an increase of the dead time: while the reconstruction efficiency drops by about 2% in the cover range in the 4-layer option, it drops by about 5% in the 3-layer option. In particular, one sees that the 4-layer option reconstruction efficiency stays higher than 98 % up to dead time value of 480 ns while for this value the 3-layer option reconstruction efficiency is about 93 %.

The latter results have been obtained by supplying to the pattern recognition program the full time sequence of hits on tube wires including the hits appearing before the time \(t_{0}\). As already said, no geometrical information can be extracted from these "before \(t_{0}\)" hits. However the pattern recognition program uses them in order to investigate if the absence of an expected hit in some track search can be explained by the presence of a preceding hit which would have been able to hide it. If no such explaination can be found, the track under construction is more likely to be a fake track. It's thus very important that the preceding efficiency was obtained under the assumption that these "before \(t_{0}\)" hits have been supplied to the pattern recognition program, i.e have been recorded 6. In figure 11, the triangles show the efficiency obtained if no such recording is made. One sees that we have a dramatic decrease when the dead time increases and that the effect is stronger in 3-layer option than in 4-layer option.

Footnote 6: More precisely, the pattern recognition program needs to know the time during which a given wire is “dead” after \(t_{0}\).

In figures 12, 13 and 14, the two last efficiencies are shown for the barrel, transition and end cap regions. In these regions, the effects are similar to those observed precedently. However one notes that the effects are much more stronger in end cap and transition regions than in the barrel region. This is due to the noise rate relatively higher in the former regions than in the latter. In the case in which the "before \(t_{0}\)" hits are recorded (squares in figures 12, 13 and 14) one sees that, for a dead time value of 480 ns, the 4-layer reconstruction efficiency remains in the worse region (end cap) close to 98% while the 3-layer reconstruction efficiency is close to about 91 %.

One concludes that the redundancy of the 4-layer option leads to a reconstruction efficiency much more robust against a degradation of the tube dead time.

### Mixed configurations

In the preceding studies, the superiority of the 4-layer option has been established. However it could turn out to be too expensive to build the muon chambers with 4 tubes layers everywhere. One can investigate the performances of a muon chamber system in which 4 tube layers are put only in some convenient places. In the following the \(\eta\), \(E\) and \(\varphi\) dependence of the reconstruction efficiency (cf figure 1) of the different configurations will be compared.

We have performed simulations in which 4 tube layers are put in the BI and EI chambers only, in the BM and EM chambers only or in the BO and EO chambers only. The results are shown in figures 15, 16 and 17 respectively. It appears that these configurations give very similar results and that in none of them the 3-layer reconstruction efficiency has been drasticaly improved. From the above figures, it could be expected that to put 4 tube layers in the BI and EM chambers is possibly the better choice but the improvement is rather poor as shown in figure 18.

It seems that only one among three stations (inner, medium and outer) with 4 tube layers is not enough. We thus have considered the configuration in which 4 tube layers are put in the BI, BM, EI and EM chambers only. It should be stressed that the difference between the number of tubes in this configuration and in the 3-layer option is only roughly 50 % of the the difference between the number of tubes in the 4-layer option and in the 3-layer option 7. The reconstruction efficiency is shown in figure 19. It's now very close to the 4-layer option reconstruction efficiency. Much more than 50% of the difference between the 4-layer and 3-layer option have been recovered. As shown in figure 20, the dependence of the reconstruction efficiency on dead time in this configuration is very similar to the dependence of the reconstruction efficiency in the 4-layer option. In particular the dramatic increase of the dependence of the 3-layer reconstruction efficiency with \(\eta\) has been cured as shown in figures 21, 22 and 23.

Footnote 7: Furthermore this configuration is obtained from the 4-layer option by removing layers of tubes of maximal lenght (BO and EO). Thus the effective difference of cost between this configuration and the 3-layer option is probably smaller than 50% of the difference of cost between the 4-layer option and the 3-layer option.

We conclude that a configuration with only one station among the three with 4 tube layers leads only to a marginal improvement. On the contrary, the 4-layer option and the configuration with 4 tube layers in the inner and medium stations (BI, BM, EI and EM) have similar performances: comparable kinematical dependence uniformities and dependences on dead time.

## 4 Conclusion

In this note we have shown that the 4-layer option leads to a reconstruction efficiency which is larger, more uniform over the detector and less dependent on the muon energy than the 3-layer option. As far as the robustness of the reconstruction efficiency against degradations of chamber performance or detector operating conditions is concerned, the 4-layer option is much more robust than the 3-layer option with the exception of the influence of noise level which has been found small in both options. The influence of performance degradation has been found to be roughly the same in all \(\eta\) ranges with the exceptions of the intrinsic tube resolution which has an important effect only important in the transition region (\(|\eta|\in[1.1,1.7]\)) and of the dead time dependence which have been found to be increasing with \(\eta\), this increase being more important for the 3-layer option than for the 4-layer option.

One concludes that, as far as pattern recognition and reconstruction is concerned, the 4-layer option is significantly prefered to the 3-layer option.

Trying to improve the performances of the 3-layer option by equiping one station among the three (inner, medium, outer) with 4 layers turns out to be not worth it. On the other hand, for a cost increase of less than 50% of the cost difference between the 4-layer and the 3-layer options, an upgrade of the 3-layer option consisting in equiping both inner and medium stations with 4 layers almost restores the performances of the full 4-layer option. We consider this last point as the most important result of our studies.

All the results presented in this note were obtained by using the same setting of the pattern recognition algorithm in all the different configurations. Some looser setting would lead to higher efficiencies with, however, increased fake tracks rates. In a coming dedicated note, we will study the variations of the reconstruction efficiency w.r.t. the fake track rate when the setting of the pattern recognition algorithm is varied.
