The energy leakage from the prototype modules of the TILECAL hadronic calorimeter has been studied for various pion energies (80, 100, 150, 180 and 300 GeV). Two methods were developed to correct the energy deposited by the punchthroughevents in the Tile calorimeter on the event-to-event basis. Both methods (NHit and Total signal) are based on the correlation between the response of the Muon walls counters and the total energy deposited in TILECAL. The NHit method takes into account the number of Muon wall counters with at least one charge particle hit, whereas the second one handles with the total signal in both Muon walls. Both methods decrease the low energy tail and for energies above 100 GeV they improve the energy resolution.

## 1 Beam Test Setup

The experimental setup in the April 1996 beam test period was very close to that of the first combined test in September 1994 (see [1]), therefore only some important items are listed below :

* Two calorimeter prototypes were exposed by the beam : the LAr barrel e.m. calorimeter prototype and the Tile calorimeter prototype modules.

* The beam entered the detectors at the angle 11 degrees, but the impact point in the Tile calorimeter was shifted by 8 cm from the centre to the left to reduce the lateral leakage.
* The TILECAL consisted of five prototype modules, each being 180 cm long with the front face 100 \(\times\)20 cm\({}^{2}\). The modules are radially segmented into 4 depth segments, which corresponds to 9 \(\lambda_{\mathrm{int}}\) in total.
* see Fig. 1) was placed behind the Tile calorimeter, whereas the side wall (the same configuration as in the May 95 standalone beamtest
- see Ref. [2]) was fixed to the central TILECAL module.
* Additional layer of scintillators (so called Midsamplers) was installed between the face of the Tile calorimeter and the cryostat to investigate the energy losses in the cryostat's depth material.

## 2 The Event Selection

First, the information from the beam detectors in front of the cryostat is used to impose cuts on the beam :

* The response from the beam scintillators is required to be compatible with that of one minimum ionizing particle (mip).
* The information from the x-y beam chambers is used to remove tracks with large angle with respect to the beam axis.

The punchthrough events are mainly those starting their hadronic showers in deeper radial segments, therefore only the events starting to develop the cascades in TILECAL have been selected. To select them, the signal from the LAr calorimeter should be compatible with that of a mip. Moreover, to remove events with hadronic interactions in the cryostat, cuts on the signal from the Midsamplers has been applied. The muon contamination was removed using the TbeamS3 scintillator counter behind the whole detection system.

## 3 Leaking Energy Measurement

The missing energy measurement suffers from the energy leakage from the calorimeter. Using the information from the Muon walls, one can estimate the leaking energy amount and thus correct the total energy deposited in the hadronic calorimeter with respect to this effect.

Two such methods were examined. The first method (called NHit method) is based on the correlation between and the number of Muon wall counters with at least one charge particle hit. The second method (called Total signal method) is similar to the first one, but takes into account the total signal in both Muon walls instead of the number of counters hit by charged particles.

### NHit Method

First, we define the counter was hit by a charge particle when the signal is greater than the "minimum" between the low-signal region and the mip peak. Now let us investigate the dependence of versus the number of Muon wall counters with charge particle hits (). It turns out that this dependence (see Fig. 2) obeys the function

(1)

where is the peak value of the non-leaking events distribution. According to this relation one can determine the values of the parameters, for each pion beam energy separately. Thus the average energy leakage for a given value is described by the relation

(2)

Taking into account the obtained parameters and, one can correct the energy according to the formula

(3)

on the event-to-event basis. The procedure was carried out separately with each of the pion energy data. The results for the 300 GeV pions are shown in Fig. 2, the complete results for all studied pion beam energies are given in Tab. 3.

### Total Signal Method

This method aims to correct the hadronic energy according to the dependence \(E_{\mbox{\tiny Hit}}\) versus the total signal1 from both Muon walls \(S_{\mbox{\tiny tot}}\). The mentioned dependence fulfils the relation

Footnote 1: The signals normalized to one mip are summed. Therefore \(S_{\mbox{\tiny tot}}\) is expressed in units of mip.

\[E_{\mbox{\tiny Hit}}=E_{\mbox{\tiny Hit}}^{0}+P1\times S_{\mbox{\tiny tot}} \tag{4}\]

so the corrected energy reads

\[E_{\mbox{\tiny Hit}}^{\mbox{\tiny corr}}=E_{\mbox{\tiny Hit}}-P1\times S_{ \mbox{\tiny tot}} \tag{5}\]

The procedure (same as in the case of the NHit method) was carried out to obtain the value \(P1\) and to calculate the corrected energy. The result for the 300 GeV pions is depicted in Fig. 3, the parameter values are listed in Tab. 3.

### Conclusion

Both methods decrease the low energy tail in the pion \(E_{\mbox{\tiny Hit}}\) distribution. This causes two effects :

* The energy resolution improvement.
* The Gaussian mean of the energy distribution shifts to that of the non-leaking events.

The NHit method works slightly better than the second one for the higher energies. Whereas the NHit method application on the 300 GeV pion data results in the approximately same low and high energy tails (events with \(E_{\mbox{\tiny Hit}}^{\mbox{\tiny corr}}<E_{\mbox{\tiny Hit}}^{\mbox{\tiny corr }}\)).
