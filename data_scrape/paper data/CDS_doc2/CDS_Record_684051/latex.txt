The \(E_{T}^{miss}\) signature will be used in the ATLAS detector to trigger on a variety of physics processes. We perform here a first evaluation of the rates for the \(E_{T}^{miss}\)+Jet trigger at the Event Filter level. The study is based on a fast simulation software including a detailed parameterisation of the calorimeter response. This approach is validated by a detailed comparison with a full simulation of the ATLAS detector. Trigger rate tables are provided for low luminosity data-taking, with the superposition of 2.3 minimum bias events.

Introduction

The \(E_{T}^{miss}\)+jet trigger is an example of global trigger, on which one cannot apply the second level trigger, which is based on the study of localised regions of interest in the detector (ROI). The only gain at second level can be obtained by sharpening the threshold of the jet which is required together with the \(E_{T}^{miss}\).

On the other side, the bulk of the \(E_{T}^{miss}\) rate will be produced by calorimetric energy measurement fluctuations in QCD jet events, and by the presence of dead material at the interface between the different detectors. The main instrumental effect is the difference in response between the different calorimeter technologies used in ATLAS and the fact that the EM calorimeter is strongly non compensating.

A detailed work was performed for the physics TDR [1], showing marked improvement in the \(E_{T}^{miss}\) resolution if appropriate weighting algorithms are applied to the calibration of the transverse energy measurement in the calorimeters. It is therefore expected that the possibility of applying the offline reconstruction procedures, available at the event filter level will result in a significant reduction of the \(E_{T}^{miss}\) rate at event filter level. The aim of this work is to evaluate what will be the \(E_{T}^{miss}\) software measurement in ATLAS for Standard Model events, and to calculate the expected rates.

## 2 Analysis strategy and event generation

In QCD multijet events the missing transverse momentum is generated by instrumental effects. A reliable estimate of the \(E_{T}^{miss}\) rate can therefore only be achieved using a simulation which reproduces in detail the response of the calorimeter system to high energy jets. On the other side, at the level of rate studies we are interested in bulk effects, and not in the extreme tails of the distributions. Therefore a simulation based on a parametrisation of the calorimeter response should be adequate for the purpose. This was the approach taken for the LVL1 \(E_{T}^{miss}\) studies [2]. The simulation program developed for that study implements into ATLFAST [3] calorimeter response and resolution functions determined from the full ATLAS GEANT simulation of both single charged pions and photons in the energy range from 200 MeV to 100 GeV.

A crucial feature of the program is the parametrisation of the longitudinal sharing of the energy deposition between the electromagnetic and the hadronic calorimeter. For the rate evaluation we need to know if this simulation reproduces accurately enough the results of the full simulation, and what kind of prescription one should use on the intercalibration of calorimeter systems.

To perform the comparison, approximately \(10^{5}\) fully simulated events were generated using DICE 3.21.07 and ATRECON 1.42.26. The events were generated using the PYTHIA 5.7[4] program, with the standard datacards used for Standard Model processes generation in the Physics performance TDR. The generation was performed with a cut of 35 GeV on the transverse momentum of the hard scattering (\(p_{T}^{hard}\)).

Several fast simulation samples were generated, always with PYTHIA 5.7. For the comparison with the full simulation a special sample with no minimum bias superposition and the same cuts at generation level as for the full simulation were produced.

In order to avoid biases on the \(E_{T}^{mi\,ss}\) spectrum, the fast simulation sample for the rate calculation was generated with a cut on \(p_{T}^{hard}\) set a 5 GeV, corresponding to a cross-section of 35 mb. Approximately three million events with an average superposition of 2.3 minimum bias events were generated in different bins of \(p_{T}^{hard}\). The minimum bias superposition was performed using the events provided by the authors of the fast simulation program, and includes the effects of the event history and of the calorimeter shaping functions as described in [2]. For technical reasons, the calorimeter response parametrisation and the minimum bias superposition are only used for the calculation of the LVL1 clusters, and for the \(E_{T}^{miss}\) evaluation, both hardware and software. The "software" jets are reconstructed using the default ATLFAST energy deposition algorithm.

The adopted approximations are expected to provide a good approximation of the reality for low luminosity LHC running. On the other hand, no attempt is done in this work to estimate the \(E_{T}^{miss}\) trigger rate at high luminosity. A correct assessment in fact would require a detailed study on software algorithms to be applied in calorimeter reconstruction to tame the fluctuation induced by the average 23 minimum bias events. This level of reconstruction study is outside the scope of this work.

## 3 Comparison with the full simulation

The full line histogram is the unbiased The basic comparison involves comparing the \(E_{T}^{miss}\) spectrum obtained with the full simulation to the spectra obtained with the fast simulation described in [2] for the variable in the fast simulation corresponding to the ideal intercalibration of the ATLAS calorimeters. Such comparison is shown in Figure 1 with \(E_{T}^{mi\,ss}\) calculated over the pseudorapidity range \(|\eta|<5\). There is a clear disagreement, and in particular the full simulation exhibits a large tail for \(E_{T}^{miss\,s}>20\) GeV. Essentially all the studies for the TDR were performed with the full simulation only within \(|\eta|<3\). Therefore the source of the observed disagreement is most likely in the energy calibration of Figure 1: _Comparison of \(E_{T}^{miss}\) spectra for full simulation (black dots) and fast simulation with parametrised energy sharing and ideal calibration (full line)[2] over the full \(\eta\) range. The comparison is shown both in linear (upper plot) and logarithmic (lower plot) scale._

the forward calorimeter simulation. To test this hypothesis, we calculated the \(E_{T}^{miss}\) spectra within \(\left|\eta\right|<3\,\)both for the full and the fast simulation. The results are shown in Figure 2, and exhibit an excellent agreement. It should be noted that in both plots the \(E_{T}^{miss}\) from full simulation is calculated by reweighting the \(E_{T}^{miss}\) components from the different calorimeters with the intercalibration factors which were used for the detailed \(E_{T}^{miss}\) studies in the TDR [1].

An indication that the discrepancy could be due to a problem with the calibration factors for the forward calorimeter is given in Figure 3. We show there for both the x and y component the correlation between the \(E_{T}^{miss}\) component calculated for \(\left|\eta\right|<3\) with the \(E_{T}^{miss}\) calculated for \(\left|\eta\right|>3\). The slope of the correlation is \(-80\), instead of \(-1\) as it would be expected for events with only a moderate amount of \(E_{T}^{miss}\). Investigations on the program used for producing the data samples used for this analysis are underway to understand the origin of observed problem.

Based on the good agreement in Figure 2 for the rate calculation in this work, we assume that the fast simulation variable shown in Figure 2 is a good approximation of the real experimental \(E_{T}^{miss}\), and that we can use the same prescription for the \(E_{T}^{miss}\) calculation down to a pseudorapidity of \(\pm 5\). We will therefore in the rest of this note refer to this variable as the'software' \(E_{T}^{miss}\), and we will use it for the Event Filter rate estimate.

Figure 2: _Comparison of \(E_{T}^{miss}\) spectra for full simulation (black dots) and fast simulation with parametrised energy sharing and ideal calibration (full line)[2] for the pseudorapidity range \(\left|\eta\right|<3\) range. The comparison is shown both in linear (left plot) and logarithmic (right plot) scale._

Figure 3: _Upper plot: X component of \(E_{T}^{miss}\) calculated in the range \(|\eta|<3\) versus the X component of \(E_{T}^{miss}\) calculated in the range \(|\eta|>3\). Lower plot: the same for the Y component. If the intercalibration of the forward calorimeter with the other calorimeters was correct we would expect the slope to be \(-1\)._

The resolution of the x component of the \(E_{T}^{miss}\) vector for the software \(E_{T}^{miss}\) is shown in Figure 4 as a function of the total transverse momentum of the event for the sample of Standard Model events generated for the rate calculation. The dashed line in the plot shows the parametrisation \(\sigma(p_{xy}^{m}iss)=0.46\times\sqrt{\sum E_{t}}\) obtained in the TDR for \(A\to\tau\tau\) events. The points for our simulation lie above the parametrisation, and are better described by the function \(\sigma(p_{xy}^{miss})=0.26\times(\sum E_{t})^{0.62}\), shown as a full line in the plot. A similar difference was observed for the study of the \(E_{T}^{miss}\) resolution or \(Z+\)jets events, documented in section 9.2.2 of [1]. The difference could be ascribed to the fact that the parametrisation in the TDR is obtained considering events including soft jets from the \(A\) decay, or the superposition of many minimum bias events, implying the contribution of a small energy deposition in many calorimeter cells. The sample at high \(\sum E_{t}\) is in our case dominated by hard QCD jets, where the energy deposition is concentrated in a small number of cells. A similar effect was observed for the study of the \(E_{T}^{miss}\) resolution of \(Z+\)jets events, documented in section 9.2.2 of [1], where a detailed

explanation in terms of the different components of the jet energy resolution is given.

It is interesting to note that the \(\sigma\) measured in this study is smaller than the one measured for the full simulation of the \(Z\)+1 jet sample, shown in Figure 9-40 of [1]. This can be due to two reasons: first the'software' \(E_{T}^{miss}\) variable we are studying is not a full simulation variable, but a parametrisation, and therefore it could exhibit a behaviour which is intermediate between the full simulation and ATLFAST. Second, the case we are studying is less extreme than the \(Z\)+1 jet case, as here the transverse energy is mostly distributed between two jets as compared to the single jet of the \(Z\)+1 jet case. The resolution should therefore be intermediate between the parametrisation for minimum bias and the results shown in Figure 9-40 of [1].

## 4 Rate calculation

### \(E_{t}^{miss}\) thresholds

A basic ingredient in the rate calculations is the calculation of the effective threshold on the software \(E_{T}^{miss}\) for a given LVL1 threshold. This effective threshold is in fact the quantity one needs in order to compare with the requirements from physics studies, and thence to decide the tradeoff between affordable rate and sensitivity to physics processes.

The evaluation is performed through the following steps:

* We produce the distributions of the software \(E_{T}^{miss}\) for events containing at least one ATLFAST jet with \(p_{T}\) in excess of 40, 50 or 60 GeV.
* We produce the software \(E_{T}^{miss}\) distributions with the same jet requirement, but with the additional requirement that the LVL1 \(E_{T}^{miss}\) be larger than a threshold \(T_{L1}\).
* We calculate the bin-by-bin ratio of the two distributions, and we parametrise the result with a Fermi-Dirac shape: \[f(x)=1-\frac{a}{1+e^{(x-b)/c}}\] wit \(a,b,c\) free parameters.
* The effective software threshold corresponding to the LVL1 threshold \(T_{L1}\) will be the value of the software \(E_{T}^{miss}\) for which the parametrised efficiency reaches 95%Even with the generation of \(\sim 3\) million events in different bins of transverse momentum of the hard scattering, the evaluation of the effective threshold has significant uncertainties, as the threshold is very different for different bins of the hard scattering \(P_{T}\), so all the contributions must be combined taking into account the relative weights of the different bins and the relative statistical errors. We show in Figure 5 the efficiency curves for the software \(E_{T}^{miss}\) for four different assumed thresholds on LVL1 \(E_{T}^{miss}\): 30, 40, 50, and 60 GeV, and for \(P_{T}^{jet}>40\) GeV. The difference between the software threshold and the LVL1 one is a function of the threshold value, and is of the order of 10 GeV. The calculated software threshold values are shown as a function of the LVL1 threshold in Figure 6 for the three thresholds in \(P_{T}^{jet}\). The difference between software an LVL1 \(E_{T}^{miss}\) threshold is observed to increase with increasing \(P_{T}^{jet}\).

For the rate evaluation at the three trigger levels we used the following correspondence between thresholds:

Level 1 \(E_{T}^{miss}\) threshold (GeV) 23 36 48 60

Software \(E_{T}^{miss}\) threshold (GeV) 40 50 60 70

For a given LVL1 threshold, the efficiency for the corresponding software threshold did \(\sim 70\%\).

### Jet thresholds

As it was done in [2], we quote the rates for the jet part of the trigger as a function of the effective threshold on the software jet \(p_{T}\) as given by the ATLFAST [3] program for jets reconstructed with the cone algorithm and a cone radius of 0.7. We chose this radius for consistency with [2] in order to be able to compare the results.

The effective threshold on jets is calculated using the procedure described in the previous section for \(E_{T}^{miss}\). We show in Figure 7 the jet efficiency as a function of the ATLFAST \(p_{T}\) for the following LVL1 nominal thresholds: 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, and 60 GeV. The difference between the LVL1 threshold and the software one goes form \(\sim 15\) GeV at 10 GeV to \(\sim 30\) GeV at 60 GeV. It should here be remarked that we observe a disagreement with the curves shown in Figure 3 of [2]. The reason of the disagreement is due to the fact that our prescription for the matching of LVL1 and software thresholds is based on the differential \(P_{T}^{jet}\) distribution, whereas in [2] the integral \(P_{T}^{jet}\) distribution was used.

### Rate tables

Based on the considerations above we give in Tables 1-3 low luminosity rates for the \(E_{T}^{miss}\)+jet trigger, corresponding to the superposition of 2.3 minimum bias events.

The rates have been calculated for three values of the software jet threshold: 40, 50 and 60 GeV, defined as described in Section4.2.

Each line in a table corresponds to a pair of software thresholds: a software jet \(P_{T}\) threshold \(T_{EF}(P_{T}^{jet})\) and an \(E_{T}^{miss}\) one \(T_{EF}\left(E_{T}^{miss}\right)\).

According to the discussion in the previous sections, let's call \(T_{EF}\) the Event Filter threshold, \(V(soft)\) the software variable on which the Event Filter acts, and \(V(LVL1)\) the corresponding Level 1 variable (\(V\) is either \(P_{T}^{jet}\) or \(E_{T}^{miss}\)). For any given \(T_{EF}\) we define the matching Level 1 threshold \(T_{L1}\) as the value of \(V(LVL1)\) such that for every \(V(soft)\) bin with \(V(soft)>T_{EF}\), at least 95% of the events in the bin have \(V(LVL1)>T_{EF}\). Using this notation entries in the tables are defined in this way:

* The 'LVL1' column is calculated by requiring: \(P_{T}^{jet}(LVL1)>T_{L1}(P_{T}^{jet})\) and \(E_{T}^{miss}(LVL1)>T_{L1}(E_{T}^{miss})\)* The 'LVL2' column is calculated by requiring: \(P_{T}^{jet}(soft)>T_{EF}(P_{T}^{jet})\) and \(E_{T}^{miss}(LVL1)>T_{L1}(E_{T}^{miss})\)
* The 'EF' column is calculated by requiring: \(P_{T}^{jet}(soft)>T_{EF}(P_{T}^{jet})\) and \(E_{T}^{miss}(soft)>T_{EF}(E_{T}^{miss})\)

The reduction factor between LVL1 and Event Filter varies with the applied cuts, and it is a factor \(\sim\) 30 for \(P_{T}^{jet}>\) 50 GeV and \(E_{T}^{miss}>\)50 GeV, corresponding to a LVL1 rate of \(\sim\) 5 kHz.

The effect of the \(\sim\)10 GeV shift between the hardware and the software threshold can be seen by comparing e.g. the numbers in Tables 2 with the curves shown in Figure 8. For the same value of the abscissa the gain between the LVL1 curve and the Event Filter curve is only a factor 4-5. The additional gain is due to the fact that, in order to preserve the full efficiency for a software \(E_{T}^{miss}\) threshold of 50 GeV, the corresponding LVL1 rate must be read off from the LVL1 curve for an \(E_{T}^{miss}\) value of 40 GeV. Conversely, if the LVL1 threshold is fixed at the nominal 50 GeV to keep the trigger rate below 1 kHz, the full efficiency for physics analyses is only achieved for a software \(E_{T}^{miss}\) of \(\sim\) 60 GeV.

The rate tables shown in the previous section are based on assigning a priori an EF \(E_{T}^{mis\,s}\) threshold, and calculating the matching LV L1 threshold. The matching between the EF and LV L1 thresholds is defined on QCD two-jet events, where the \(E_{T}^{miss}\) is generated by detector effects. The interesting question, though, is, given a trigger threshold which is acceptable for the ATLAS data-taking, for what value of the'real' \(E_{T}^{miss}\) of interest for physics studies we are fully efficient.

The \(E_{T}^{miss}\) trigger is aimed at discovering physics processes in which the final state includes particles which escape the detector. The most popular class of theories producing such particles is supersymmetry (SUSY), where the lightest supersymmetric particle is electrically neutral and does not interact in the detector, yielding the 'classical' \(E_{T}^{miss}\)+jets signatures. The \(E_{T}^{miss}\) spectrum of SUSY events is mainly determined by the mass of the supersymmetric partners of quarks and gluons, squarks and gluinos. The softest \(E_{T}^{miss}\) spectrum is observed for the lightest squarks and gluinos. We have chosen to simulate, among the may different SUSY models studied in [1], the so-called SUGRA Point 3, with squark and gluino masses of the order of 300 GeV (see Tables 20-3 and 20-4 of [1]). This mass scale is below the the upper limit of the mass range which will be explored by the Tevatron at Run II [6], and can therefore be considered a worst case scenario.

A total sample of 100000 events for Point 3 were generated with the HERWIG 6.0 Monte Carlo [5], and passed through the detector simulation described in Section 2.

We show in Figure 10 the efficiency curves for the real transverse momentum imbalance for the choices of LV L1 and EF thresholds of Table 2. The curves are built according to the prescriptions of Section 4.1. The full efficiency is reached for values of the real \(E_{T}^{miss}\) which are 25 to 35 GeV higher than the EF threshold. If we take as a baseline \(E_{T}^{miss\,s}\)+jets trigger the one corresponding to the pair of thresholds \(T_{EF}\)(\(P_{T}^{jet}\))=50 GeV and \(T_{EF}\)(\(E_{T}^{miss}\))=60 GeV, with a LV L1 rate of 0.5 kHz, and an EF rate of 50 kHz, the efficiency for SUGRA Point 3 is approximately 75%. We show in Figure 11 the spectra of the real \(E_{T}^{miss\,s}\) for the unbiased sample (full line) and after the EF trigger (dashed line). An acceptable efficiency for analysis is reached for an \(E_{T}^{miss}\) value around 80 GeV.

In order to compare with the requirements from physics analysis studies, it should be noted that those studies are usually based on cuts on an \(E_{T}^{miss}\) variable calculated from calorimeter cells with ideal energy smearing, which is nearer to the'software' \(E_{T}^{miss}\) than to the real one. For the physics analysis based on the \(E_{T}^{miss}\)+jets trigger described in [1] the minimum cut on \(E_{T}^{miss}\) considered is 100 GeV, well above the trigger threshold of 60 GeV, and also in excess of the effective threshold on the real \(E_{T}^{miss}\).

## 6 Conclusions

We a have performed first estimate of the \(E_{T}^{miss}\)+jets trigger rate at the Event Filter level.

As a preliminary step to this evaluation we have compared the \(E_{T}^{miss}\) spectrum for two-jet events obtained using the parametrisation described in [2] with the result of the GEANT full detector simulation. The good agreement observed justifies the use of the parametrised simulation for this study. The validity of the approximation is however restricted to low luminosity running, a more detailed study should be performed to correctly estimate the high luminosity rates.

Using this simulation we have produced tables of the expected rates at EF level for different software thresholds on the jet \(P_{T}\) and on the software \(E_{T}^{miss}\). For a threshold on \(P_{T}^{jet}\) set at 50 GeV and a threshold on \(E_{T}^{miss}\) at 60 GeV, the EF rate is \(\sim\)50 Hz, with a reduction of approximately a factor ten with respect to the LVL1 trigger with matching thresholds. It was verified that this threshold is adequate for the study of supersymmetry in the \(E_{T}^{miss}\)+jets channel.
