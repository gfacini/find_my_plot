We have studied the kinematic of minimum bias events and evaluated the energy deposited in the Atlas liquid argon calorimeter for different sizes of cluster by the pile-up of these events during one maching crossing at the highest luminosity.

At the highest luminosity available at the LHC, 25 to 40 minimum bias events in mean per machine crossing will be superimposed to the interesting events depending the time between two machine crossing. The mean value of the energy deposited by these events in the liquid argon calorimeter is subtracted during the data treatment but the fluctuations of the energy around the mean value are one of the limitations on the precision of the energy measurement by the calorimeter. Using simulated data, we have estimated the \(\vec{E}_{\rm t}\) and the RMS of the \(E_{\rm t}\) distribution for two types of calorimetric clusters, electromagnetic and jet clusters, and for two values of the mean number of the Poisson distribution: 25 and 40 minimum bias events per machine crossing. These two values correspond in first approximation to the mean number of events per machine crossing if the time between two consecutive crossing is respectively 15 and 30 ns.

## 2 Events sample

For this study, we have used cartridges I28411, I28414, I28492, I28413, I28415, I28493 (file PROD_LOI tapes). The minimum bias events have been generated using PYTHIA 5.5 tune according the work done for the Aachen conference (Reference: Monte Carlo simulation of minimum bias events at the LHC energy G. Ciapetti, A. Di Ciaccio). The particles of the generated events having a rapidity of \(\pm\) 3 are extrapolated in the fully simulated Atlas setup. A very low value for the energy cuts used in the simulation of the shower developpement, is choosen to use also these files for other purposes like the study of the multiplicity of soft hits in the tracking device or the distribution of the momentum of punch through particles at the exit of the return yoke (For all the values of the cuts see N_EAGLEA and N_EAGLEB datacards).

## 3 Kinematic of the minimum bias events

The figures 0(a) and 0(b) give the distribution of the number of charged particles, neutral particles per minimum bias event in \(\pm\) 3 units of rapidity. The total number of particles is given by the figure 0(c). We have per minimum bias event a mean value of 28 charged particles, 33 neutral particles and 61 particles in total. The figures 1(a) and 1(b) give respectively the distribution of the sum of the momentum of photons, electrons and positrons and of the hadrons in \(\pm\) 3 units of rapidity per minimum bias event. The sum of the momentum of all the particles in \(\pm\) 3 units of rapidity is presented on figure 1(c). The mean value of these three distribution is respectively: 24 GeV/c, 56 GeV/c and 79 GeV/c in \(\pm\) 3 units of rapidity. The distribution of the sum of the momentum of particles in the barrel rapidity (\(\eta\) = \(\pm\) 1.5) is presented on the figure 2(a). A fraction of this energy is taken by charged tracks of \(P_{t}\) less than 0.3 GeV/c (figure 2(b)). These tracks are trapped in the magnetic field.

The figures 3(a), 3(b), 3(c) and 3(d) present the \(P_{t}\) distribution of the particles of the minimum bias events for four bins in rapidity: \(\eta\)\(<\) 0.5, 0.5\(<\)\(\eta\)\(|\)\(<\) 1.0, 1.0\(<\)\(\eta\)\(|\)\(<\) 1.5, 1.5\(<\)\(\eta\)\(|\)\(<\) 2.0. These distributions are similar and the mean \(P_{t}\) is 0.4 GeV/c. The distribution of the transverse energy is in a good approximation independant of the rapidity and we will used \(E_{\rm t}\) as variable.

The figure 5 gives the probability to have a particle of \(P_{t}\) greater than a given \(P_{t}^{\rm min}\) per minimum bias event in \(\pm\) 1.5 unit of rapidity. The distribution of the figure corresponds to 18 units of rapidity. This plot can be used to evaluate the effect of an isolation cut.

We present on the figures 5(a), 5(b) and 6(a), 6(b) the distribution of the number of particles and the total energy deposited in \(\pm\) 3 unit of rapidity respectively for 25 and 40 e Simulation of the bunch crossing

We take a random number according to a Poisson law of mean value 25 or 40. To study in an unbias way the effect of the minimum bias events we must consider only one cluster surface \(\Delta\eta\times\Delta\phi\) in the calorimeter per simulated machine crossing. If in to study the distribution of \(E_{\rm t}\), we use all the elementary cells \(\Delta\eta\times\Delta\phi\), we introduce some correlation in the \(E_{\rm t}\) distribution due to the correlation between the particles of the same event. Due to our limited statistic (6000 events), we take a few cells per machine crossing (3 in \(\eta\) and 6 in \(\phi\)). We compare this distribution of the \(E_{\rm t}\) to the one obtained by using all the calorimeter cells. Looking to \(\overline{E_{\rm t}}\) and the RMS of the \(E_{\rm t}\) distribution we conclude that the correlation is weak.

## 5 Calibration of the simulated data

The simulated data have been calibrated using files of single electron and pion of given momemtum. We use the value of G. Unal:

1. 6.2 for photons and electrons in the liquid argon electromagnetic calorimeter.
2. 9.1 for hadrons in the liquid argon electromagnetic calorimeter.
3. 20 for hadrons in the liquid argon hadronic calorimeter.

As we do not know the nature of the particles in a given cell after the pileup due to one machine crossing, we use as constant for the electromagnetic compartements of the calorimeter, the mean value of the two constants of the electromagnetic compartments : 7.5.

## 6 Pile up in the electron photon case

The analysis of the data taken with the prototype of the electromagnetic liquid argon calorimeter concludes that the size \(\Delta\eta\times\Delta\phi\) of an electromagnetic shower in this calorimeter is comprise between \(0.06\times 0.06\) and \(0.10\times 0.10\). The study of different channels of physics has demonstrated the necessity of bigger surface like \(\Delta\eta\times\Delta\phi=0.18\times 0.18\) as isolation cut for identification of the isolated photon. The basic calorimetric area \(\Delta\eta\times\Delta\phi\) in our simulation is \(0.02\times 0.02\).

The figures 8a, 8b, 8c and 9a, 9b, 9c present the distribution of the transverse energy \(E_{\rm t}\) deposited in the two electromagnetic compartments for different cluster sizes (0.06 \(\times\) 0.06, 0.10 \(\times\) 0.10, 0.08 \(\times\) 0.08) for two values of the mean number of events per machine crossing. On the figures 8d and 9d we present the distribution of the transverse energy deposited in all the elementary cells \(\Delta\eta\times\Delta\phi=0.08\times\) of the barrel calorimeter. If we compare the \(\overline{E_{\rm t}}\) and the RMS of the \(E_{\rm t}\) distribution with the values of distribution of the figures 8c and 9c we can conclude that the correlations are weak. The Table 1 on page 3 gives the \(\overline{E_{\rm t}}\) and the RMS of the \(E_{\rm t}\) distribution for different sizes of electromagnetic cluster and for the two mean numbers of events per machine crossing.

The naive expectation is that the \(\vec{E_{\rm t}}\) is proportional to the surface \(\Delta\eta\times\Delta\phi\) and that the RMS of the \(E_{\rm t}\) distribution is proportional to the square root of the area. We verify it on the figures 10a and 10b.

Starting from these distributions we calculate the probability that an \(E_{\rm t}\) deposited in a \(\Delta\eta\times\Delta\phi\) cell is greater that a given \(E_{\rm t}^{\rm min}\). We give these probabilities for cell of \(\Delta\eta\times\Delta\phi=0.06\times 0.06\), \(0.08\times 0.08\), \(0.10\times 0.10\), \(0.18\times 0.18\) the figures 11a, 11b, 11c, 11d and 12a, 12b, 12c, 12d for the two mean numbers of events per machine crossing. The probability of having an \(E_{\rm t}\) above a given threshold increases faster than the square root of the surface.

7. **Pile-up in the jet case**

The figures 13a, 13b, 13c and 14a, 14b, 14c present the \(E_{\rm t}\) deposited in the electromagnetic and hadronic barrel calorimeter for three values of the opening angle \(\Delta R\) of the jet cone: \(\Delta R\) = 0.3, 0.5, 0.7. \(\Delta R\) is value of the half angle of the cone. The Table 2 gives the values of the \(\vec{E_{\rm t}}\) and the RMS of the \(E_{\rm t}\) distributions.

The figures 15a and 15b display the variation of the \(\vec{E_{\rm t}}\) with the surface of the jet cluster and the variation of the RMS of the \(E_{\rm t}\) distribution with the square root of the surface of the jet cluster. The naive expectation is still verified. But if we extrapolate the value found for the electromagnetic cluster, the \(\vec{E_{\rm t}}\) is in agreement but the RMS is much bigger for the jet cluster. This effect is due to the fact that a fraction of the minimum bias events is jets like events.

Starting from these distributions we calculate the probability that an \(E_{\rm t}\) deposited in a surface \(\Delta R\) is greater that a given \(E_{\rm t}^{\rm min}\). These probabilities are given for the three sizes \(\Delta R\) = 0.3, 0.5, 0.7 on the figures 16a, 16b, 16c and 17a, 17b, 17c for the two mean numbers of events per machine crossing.
