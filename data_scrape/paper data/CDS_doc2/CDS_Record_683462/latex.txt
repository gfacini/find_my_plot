## 1 Abstract

We present the results of measurements made to help understand the response of the injection molded scintillators proposed for use in the ATLAS tile calorimeter. Using the ANL \(\beta\) source spectrometer, we have looked at the light output of seven scintillators having dimensions 35cm x 10cm x 0.3 cm, one scintillator with dimensions 29cm x 10 cm x 0.3 cm, and one Bicron cast scintillator tile of dimensions 28cm x 8cm x 0.3cm. The photoelectron yield was found to be about 1 PE for the injection molded tiles, and about 2.4 PE for the Bicron scintillator. The attenuation length for the injection molded scintillator was found to be about 12 cm, while the attenuation length for the Bicron was found to be about 64 cm. Masking was found to eliminate the U-shaped response seen in the direction between fibers. Uniformity was found to be about 5%, but with a sacrifice of a 25% loss in light yield.

## 2 Introduction

A major concern in the tile calorimeter group is the non-uniform response of the injection molded scintillator provided by Protvino. In particular, the light output across the face of the tiles shows about a 50% increase in light near the WLS fibers. Various groups have done masking on the tiles and have found success in flattening the response. We have not focussed on maskingtricks but instead have tried to see if the nonuniformity could be explained by edge effects of the scintillator, or whether the scintillator has inherently low transmission quality.

We have measured the light output of a sample of tiles by moving the tiles through a beam of \(\beta\) particles from a Ru\({}^{106}\) spectrometer1, so that 3 MeV MIPs are selected. Besides measuring the \(N_{pe}\) distribution of a sample, we have experimented with the edges of one of the injection molded tiles to see how the light output depends on the edges. Finally, this tile with the standard edges removed is compared to a similar piece of Bicron RH4 cast scintillator.

## 3 Description of Measurement

Figures 1a and 1b show a diagram of the test setup. We placed samples of ATLAS (or similar shaped) tiles inside the light-tight box of the Ru\({}^{106}\) spectrometer. In all of these measurements the tiles were readout with a single loop of Bicron BCF91A fiber, 1mm \(\phi\), both ends of the loop coupled with grease to a single PMT. The tile was tightly wrapped with aluminized mylar. The length of the fibers extending from the tile edges to the PMT was about 60 cm, and the loop of fiber at the opposite end was about 40 cm.

The tiles were mounted on a scanning table that had travel limits of 17 cm in X ( \(\perp\) to fiber direction), and \(>\) 11 cm in Y (\(\parallel\) to fiber direction). The PMT data was digitized and the resulting pulse height converted to the equivalent PE yield by comparing to an LED calibration. 2000 triggers were taken at each coordinate. We estimate the systematic error at any point as \(\pm 2.5\%\) by looking at the PE distribution in a narrow region where the tile response is not rapidly changing.

With the assumption that the edges of the injection molded scintillator affect the light uniformity, one of our tests was to use a standard ATLAS tile, and refinish the long edges and the short edges. This refinished tile could then be compared with a commercial scintillator of the same dimensions. We then attempted masking by wrapping Tedlar around the ends of the scintillator. After this technique was shown to work, we proceeded to map the reponsesof a sample of ATLAS tiles. Table 1 gives the relation between a tile ID and what was measured.

An attempt was made to use the standard ATLAS fibers to readout the tiles, however, the light yield was poor, so this readout was abandoned for the time being. (These fibers are now in the process of having the ends re-silvered.)

Our coordinate system is x=y=0 is the center of a tile, and the dimensions in Table 1 are at the center points.

## 4 Results

Figure 2 shows a the results from the standard ATLAS Tile #1. Near the center or the tile we see about 0.5 PE/MIP/side. The U-shaped behavior is evident: near the fiber, the light output increases by 60%. We can fit the distribution to the form

\[N_{pe}(A+B)=K(e^{-(x-x_{0})/\lambda}+e^{(x-x_{0}-L)/\lambda}) \tag{1}\]

where L is the width of the scintillator, and \(\lambda\) is the attenuation lenght of the scintillator. \(K,x_{0},and\lambda\) are free parameters. Fitting not too near the

If the long edges of the tile are polished by hand, we see a slight improvement in the attenuation length as seen in figure 3. Because of surface tension, the edges of the injection molded tiles have a slight level extending inward about 5 mm. If this level is removed from the long edge, the effect on the uniformity is negligible also. Figure 4 shows the comparison between Tile #1 and Tile #1b. It is not clear if there is a real loss of light, or in fact if some element of the optics had changed to uniformly lower the light yield. In any case, the long edge does not drastically effect the uniformity.

If we remove the groove and beveled edge on the short side of the tile, and place the fiber directly on the flat edge, we see a small but significant change in both light yield and attenuation length as seen in Fig. 5. Tile #1c has all edges flat, and hand polished.

If we take this tile and apply a mask by wrapping a 3 cm wide strip of Tedlar around the tile ends parallel to the fibers, we significantly change the uniformity, but with a sacrifice in light yield. The fitted \(\lambda\) is increased to 14.2 cm, and the light yield has dececreased by about 25% over the Tile #1c as shown in Fig. 6a. The uniformity of the masked Tile #1d is shown in Fig. 6b and has an RMS of 5% from center to edge.

We can now fabricate by hand a piece of commercial scintillator with flat edges and the same dimension as Tile #1d. A piece of Bicron RH4 scintillator was fitted with fibers along the short edges, and simply wrapped with aluminized mylar. The output of this tile is shown in Fig. 7 in comparison with our best attempt at masking, and the original ATLAS tile. The Bicron scintillator yields about 2.5 times as much light as the injection molded tile, with a uniformity from center to end of tile of 2.5% without any kind of masking.

Taking a set of larger injection molded tiles, 35 cm x 10 cm x 0.3 cm, we look at the response between tiles to get an idea of the manufacturing quality. Figures 8a and 8b show source scans for six of these tiles. Except for the early Tile #0, the tiles give remarkably similar responses. The RMS of the yield for all six samples measured at points between 2 and 8 cm is 4.2%. An attenuation length is determined to be about 12 cm for each of the unmasked samples.

Finally, we present the output measured with a pair of the standard ATLAS fibers. These fibers are about 175 cm long, sort-of mirrored at the far end, and attached to Tile #2 at the end near the silvering. Thus the scintillator light travels through about 170 cm of green fiber before reaching the PMT. This distance should be compared to the 65 cm with the fiber loop. Since the attenuation of 1mm \(\phi\) WLS fiber is about 130 cm3, we expect to see about a factor of 2 less light. Figure 9 shows the yield from Tile #2 with the ATLAS fibers. The PE yield between 2 and 8 cm is exactly 50% that of the average of the tiles shown in Fig. 8.

We also looked at the response of individual fibers to MIPs. The two ATLAS fibers, and a length of BCF91A from Argonne were scanned with the source perpendicular to their axis. Figure 10 shows that scintillation light in any of these three fibers amounts to about 0.1 PE, or 10% of what an injection Molded tile gives.

## 5 Conclusion

Several conclusions can be drawn from this initial study of the ATLAS tiles:

* The long edges of the tiles have little effect on the optics,
* Edges near the fiber have a noticeable effect on the optics. Smoothing and polishing these edges increases both the attenuation length and the photoelectron yield.
* Masking the tile surfaces near the fibers results in a response uniform to 5%, but with a 25% decrease in light yield.
* The attenuation length of the scintillator is poor. In fact, just looking through the edges one can see regions where the index of refraction changes, presumably during the pouring and/or cooling process.
* The U-shape behavior is most likely due to the short attenuation length of the injection molded scintillator. Using a better scintillator can give up to 2.5 times more light.

Therefore, two options to obtain uniform tiles:

1. Increase effective \(\lambda\) by masking tiles. Some effort. This technique has the drawback of reducing the overall light yield.
2. Increase \(\lambda\) by making better scintillator. No extra work at all. This technique has the benefit of increasing the overall light yield. However the cost of this option should be evaluated.

Furthermore, the value of the groove in the scintillator should be re-assessed based on observations that the short edge of the scintillator is critical to the optics, and also since a better quality scintillator can be obtained if this feature is not required.
