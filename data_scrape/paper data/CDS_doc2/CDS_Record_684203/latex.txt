###### Abstract

Using a full simulation and reconstruction of muons in the air-core muon system, independent contributions to the \(\frac{\Delta p}{p}\) resolution are calculated as a function of muon momenta. Their dependence on several aspects of the muon system are described and compared with updated calculations using the same geometrical configuration as the ATLAS LoI.

## 1 Introduction

The simulation and reconstruction techniques used here are those presented in [1]. Briefly: the High Pressure Drift Tube (HPDT) Option in the Air-Core Toroid is simulated using a test-beam geometry. The simulation is used in this Note to calculate the individual contributions to the total \(\frac{\Delta p}{p}\) resolution as a function of muon momenta. Contributions from :

* Multiple scattering.
* Measurement errors due to the HPDT resolution.
* Measurement errors due to the superlayer alignment.
* Energy losses in material prior to the muon system.

can be considered as independent and so may be combined in quadrature to yield the total for a given muon momentum.

The nominal parameters of the system are given in Table 1 and are analogous to that of the complete ATLAS system at \(\eta\approx 0\) in the \(\phi\) region between two superconducting coils [2]. This set-up is described in more detail in [1].

Section 2 gives the contributions for this set of nominal system parameters. Sections 3 and 4 describe how the HPDT hit resolution and mattress alignment accuracy affect the \(\frac{\Delta p}{p}\) contributions.

## 2 Nominal Resolution Contributions

The \(\frac{\Delta p}{p}\) contributions from multiple scattering, energy losses in material prior to the muon system and from the measurement precision of the HPDT superlayers are given in Table 2 and shown in Figure 1 for a range of muon momenta up to 1 TeV/c. Electromagnetic showers accompanying the muons are neglected for the purpose of the current study. It is important to note that, for muon momenta below 100 GeV/c, it is the multiple scattering contribution which dominates. This is a momentum region of considerable importance for Higgs detection over a wide range of Higgs masses [3]. The energy loss contribution's significance drops rapidly in this region, dropping below that of the measurement contribution above approximately 50 GeV/c.

The nominal measurement precision of a single HPDT is chosen to be :

so as to be comparable with the nominal 100 \(\mu\)m uncertainty assumed in the LoI [4] and in [2]. This is intended to correspond to the combined HPDT accuracy _and_ alignment uncertainty [5]. These nominal parameters are chosen here for consistency only. A comparison of the \(\frac{\Delta p}{p}\) contributions from the present calculations and those from [2] is given in Table 3. This shows rough agreement between the two approaches.

There are several potential differences involved when making such a comparison, namely :

* The calculations of [2] make use of a more sophisticated track fit than is employed here to take into account large multiple scatterings in the fit. This, together with the assumption of a uniform field in the present simulation, are expected to account for the small difference shown in Table 3.
* The asymmetric \(\frac{\Delta p}{p}\) distributions arising due to Landau tails make the contributions given here dependent on the fitting method used. This is discussed in more detail in [1] whilst the approach chosen here is to use the "high" side of the \(\frac{\Delta p}{p}\) distribution and the equivalent number of bins on the other side as input to a symmetric Gaussian fit. This largely avoids the Landau tails for most energies. At muon momenta from \(0\to 20\) GeV/c however, some contamination remains using this method.
* The nominal measurement error of 100 \(\mu\)m per superlayer is approximated by using the HPDT resolution of 173 \(\mu\)m described previously. The average number of HPDT hits is found to be 17.93 out of a possible maximum of 18. The 0.4 % loss of efficiency is completely due to the dead regions created by the 500 \(\mu\)m wall thickness.

Considering the assumptions inherent in both methods, and difficulties encountered in creating identical conditions, the comparison shown here is satisfactory.

## 3 Dependence on the HPDT Resolution

The dependence of the \(\frac{\Delta p}{p}\) contribution, due to the HPDT resolution alone, as a function of \(\mu\) momentum is given in Table 4 and shown in Figure 2.

The dependence of the \(\frac{\Delta p}{p}\) resolution on muon momentum in this configuration is described by [6] :

\[\frac{\Delta p}{p}\ =\ \left[\frac{3.3\ \sqrt{A_{n}}\ \epsilon}{B\ L^{2}} \right]p \tag{1}\]

Figure 1: _Muon momentum dependence of the multiple scattering, energy loss and measurement contributions to the resolution._where :

\(\epsilon\) is the HPDT coordinate accuracy perpendicular to the field,

\(B\) is the field strength (in Tesla) and equal to 0.6 T in the simulation,

\(L\) is the lever-arm of the system and equal to 5 m in the simulation.

The quantity \(\sqrt{A_{n}}\) is the "geometrical factor" and is related to the distribution of the measuring points over the lever-arm distance. Once this is known for a given system, the \(\frac{\Delta p}{p}\) resolution may be calculated for any arbitrary set of \(\epsilon\), \(B\), \(L\) or muon momenta. A fit to the values in Table 4 yeilds the results for \(\sqrt{A_{n}}\) given in Table 5. The fitted constants are compatible and yield an combined value of :

\[\sqrt{A_{n}}\ =\ 3.79\ \underbrace{+0.02}_{stat.}\ \underbrace{+0.10}_{syst.} \tag{2}\]

The systematic uncertainty arises from otherwise negligible \(\frac{\Delta p}{p}\) contributions to the resolution which remain in the simulation.

## 4 Dependence on the Mattress Alignment Uncertainty

The uncertainty in the positions of the three mattresses making up any muon measurement has been incorporated in the simulation [1]. The \(\frac{\Delta p}{p}\) contribution from this source alone is given in Table 6 for alignment accuracies of 50, 100 and 150 \(\mu\)m per _mattress_1. At high muon

momenta the alignment uncertainty becomes of a similar order as the muon sagitta. Examples of the resulting \(\frac{\Delta p}{p}\) distributions are shown in Figure 3 where it is clear that the effect becomes more pronounced at high muon momenta and when there is a large uncertainty in the mattress alignment.

The resolution contributions given in Table 6 are obtained with a similar fitting procedure to that used for the Energy Loss Contributions in Section 2, except that the fit is used to avoid the tails on the "high" side of the distributions. These asymmetric \(\frac{\Delta p}{p}\) distributions have been studied in two ways :

* By comparing the fitted width with that expected from equation (1), when making use of (2). This shows that the mattress alignment contribution is essentially similar to that of an assumed HPDT contribution with a tube resolution of : \[\text{Hypothetical HPDT Resolution}=\sqrt{6}\times\text{ Mattress Alignment Uncertainty}\] This gives widths in close agreement with those from the mattress alignment uncertainty in isolation. Table 6.
* By calculating the fraction of fitted muon tracks in the tails of the \(\frac{\Delta p}{p}\) distributions. These values are given in Table 7.

The latter values show that only a few percent of the fits are affected below 1 TeV/c for the, rather pessimistic, estimates of the alignment uncertainty tested here. These values are in

Such results emphasise the need for both a good HPDT resolution _and_ a small mattress alignment uncertainty.

## 5 Conclusions

A detailed break-down of the various contributions to the muon momentum resolution shows that multiple scattering plays a dominant role up to momenta around 100 GeV/c. At higher momenta, the HPDT and mattress alignment precisions dominate. Large mattress misalignments lead to asymmetric \(\frac{\alpha_{P}}{p}\) distributions when the mattress position uncertainty becomes of the same order as the track sagitta. This contribution is expected to remain below the level of a few percent for realistic alignment expectations up to 1 TeV/c.
