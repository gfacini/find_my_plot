###### Abstract

The reconstruction of \(B_{d}^{0}\) decays in the decay channels \(B_{d}^{0}\to J/\Psi K_{S}^{0}\) and \(B_{d}^{0}\to\pi^{+}\pi^{-}\) using the ATLAS Barrel Tracker has been simulated with varying silicon strip detector z resolution and varying placement precision. Upper limits for z resolution and placement precision are obtained by studying the impact on \(B_{d}^{0}\) mass and decay vertex resolution.

The capability of the ATLAS Inner Detector in the Panel layout to reconstruct B-meson decays and reject the background crucially depends on the resolution of the silicon detectors in the barrel region. To obtain an estimate for the required z resolution of the silicon strip detectors the mass and decay vertex resolution in the channels \(B_{d}^{0}\to J/\Psi K_{s}^{0}\), \(B_{d}^{0}\to\pi^{+}\pi^{-}\) have been studied as a function of the z resolution. Pattern recognition considerations favour a small stereo angle because this produces less stereo 'ghosts'. However, the z resolution scales like \(\frac{1}{sin\alpha}\) (where \(\alpha\) is the stereo angle). Therefore to determine the optimum stereo angle this study aims to put an upper limit on the z resolution. Four different layout options of the silicon detector have been taken into account to be able to simulate both low and high luminosity running.

Assuming that for low luminosity running the Second Level Trigger is reconstructing B decays there might not be enough time to correct for placement errors of the silicon detectors. This would set an upper limit on the placement precision required and has therefore been simulated.

## 2 Layouts

The Barrel Tracker has been simulated in four layouts. The first (low luminosity) option has five silicon strip detector layers at radii of 20 cm to 60 cm plus two pixel layers at 11.5 cm and 13 cm as well as a high resolution vertex detector at 6 cm (see Figure 1). The TRD has been approximated by a single layer at radius of 1 m with r\(\varphi\)-precision of 60\(\mu\)m and essentially no z resolution. For the remaining three layout options the three innermost layers have been removed one by one. The resolutions used in the simulation are listed in Table 1. The z resolution of the five silicon strip layers (abbreviated with \(\sigma_{z}\)) is varying.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{||l||r||r|r|r|r|r|r|r|r|} \hline \hline radius & [cm] & 6 & 11.5 & 13.0 & 20 & 30 & 40 & 50 & 60 & 100 \\ \hline rad. length & [\%\(X_{0}\)] & 0.7 & 1.5 & 1.5 & 2 & 2 & 2 & 2 & - \\ \hline r\(\varphi\)-res. & [\(\mu\)m] & 10 & 14.4 & 57.7 & 20 & 30 & 40 & 40 & 40 & 60 \\ \hline z-res. & [\(\mu\)m] & 10 & 57.7 & 14.4 & \(\sigma_{z}\) & \(\sigma_{z}\) & \(\sigma_{z}\) & \(\sigma_{z}\) & \(\infty\) \\ \hline layout 1 & & \(\surd\) & \(\surd\) & \(\surd\) & \(\surd\) & \(\surd\) & \(\surd\) & \(\surd\) & \(\surd\) \\ layout 2 & & & \(\surd\) & \(\surd\) & \(\surd\) & \(\surd\) & \(\surd\) & \(\surd\) & \(\surd\) \\ \hline layout 3 & & & & \(\surd\) & \(\surd\) & \(\surd\) & \(\surd\) & \(\surd\) & \(\surd\) \\ \hline layout 4 & & & & \(\surd\) & \(\surd\) & \(\surd\) & \(\surd\) & \(\surd\) & \(\surd\) \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}

## 3 The Monte Carlo Program

### Tracking

Because of the relatively large parameter space to be covered in this study the simulation was done with a simple Monte Carlo program written in FORTRAN. Using the standard cuts as summarised in Table 2 a spectrum of \(B_{d}^{0}\)-mesons has been generated with PYTHIA [1] and then forced to decay either via \(B_{d}^{0}\to J/\Psi K_{s}^{0}\to e^{+}e^{-}\pi^{+}\pi^{-}\) or \(B_{d}^{0}\to\pi^{+}\pi^{-}\). The final state particles are tracked (simulating multiple scattering) through an idealised detector consisting of cylindrical planes with the appropriate resolution.

\begin{tabular}{||l|l||} \hline \hline Particle & Cut \\ \hline \hline Tag \(\mu\) & \(p_{t}>6\) GeV \\  & \(|\eta|<1.6\) \\ \hline \(B_{d}^{0}\) & \(|\eta|<1\) \\ \hline e \((B_{d}^{0}\to J/\Psi K_{s}^{0})\) & \(p_{t}>1\) GeV \\ \hline \(\pi\)\((B_{d}^{0}\to J/\Psi K_{s}^{0})\) & \(p_{t}>0.5\) GeV \\ \hline \(\pi\)\((B_{d}^{0}\to\pi^{+}\pi^{-})\) & \(p_{t}>3\) GeV \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}

### Fitting Method

A helix is fitted to the simulated hits using a FORTRAN routine written by A. Poppleton. To account for multiple scattering, which is not included in this fast fitting routine, an error matrix parametrised in momentum, decay radius and \(\Theta\) has to be added to the covariance matrix. It is then possible to make a second fit with kinematical constraints (vertex constraint and in the \(\mathrm{J}/\Psi K^{0}_{s}\) channel mass constraints) to improve the mass resolution (see Appendix B). Details on the parametrisation of the covariance matrix are given in Appendix A.

## 4 Results

### Z resolution

For each of the four layout options the following quantities have been computed with varying strip detector z resolution \(\sigma_{z}\):

* \(K^{0}_{S}\) and \(\mathrm{J}/\Psi\) mass resolution (Figures 2-6)
* \(B^{0}_{d}\) mass resolution in the \(B^{0}_{d}\to\pi^{+}\pi^{-}\) channel (Figure 11) and in the \(B\to J/\Psi K^{0}_{S}\) channel (\(\mathrm{J}/\Psi\) and \(K^{0}_{S}\) mass constraints, Figures 7- 10)
* \(B^{0}_{d}\) decay vertex resolution in both channels (Figures 12-13)

As the \(K^{0}_{S}\) has a mean decay length of about 30 cm the number of points available for reconstruction of the two pion tracks is not constant for all the events. Therefore the \(K^{0}_{S}\) and \(B^{0}_{d}\) mass resolution depends on the decay radius of the \(K^{0}_{S}\) (see Figures 2- 9). Also due to the long \(K^{0}_{S}\) decay length there is a relatively small difference between the different layouts in terms of \(B^{0}_{d}\) and \(K^{0}_{S}\) mass resolution. A substantial part of \(K^{0}_{S}\) particles decays beyond the pixel layers at 11.5 cm and 13 cm so that for these events the number of pion hits is equal for all layout options.

The \(J/\Psi\) mass resolution does not turn out to be very sensitive to changes in \(\sigma_{z}\) as all the \(J/\Psi\)'s are produced within the first layer. The same argument holds for the \(B^{0}_{d}\) mass resolution in the \(B^{0}_{d}\to\pi^{+}\pi^{-}\) channel. Comparing the \(J/\Psi\) mass resolution in Figure 6 with the mass resolution of \(K^{0}_{s}\)'s which decay within the first silicon layer (Figure 2), two differences can be noticed:

* for \(\sigma_{z}\to 0\) the \(J/\Psi\) mass resolution is worse than the \(K^{0}_{S}\) mass resolution, as the electrons produced by the \(J/\Psi\) decay have on average higher \(p_{t}\) than the pions produced by the \(K^{0}_{S}\) decay (mean electron \(p_{t}=6\) GeV, mean pion \(p_{t}=3\) Gev)
* the \(K^{0}_{S}\) mass resolution is a much steeper function of \(\sigma_{z}\) than the \(J/\Psi\) mass resolution. This is due to a difference in the opening angle of their decay products (mean electron opening angle = 42\({}^{\circ}\), mean pion opening angle = 11\({}^{\circ}\)) which makes the precision of the angular measurement in the r-z plane (and therefore the z resolution) more important for the \(K^{0}_{S}\) reconstruction.

The overall \(B^{0}_{d}\to J/\Psi K^{0}_{S}\) mass resolution plotted in Figure 10 has finally been used to determine the required z resolution. Assuming a z resolutionof 1 mm the \(B_{d}^{0}\) mass resolution would be about 25% worse than the best possible value, whereas a z resolution of more than 2 mm would double the \(B_{d}^{0}\) mass resolution. As the background in this channel is expected to be small, a z resolution of 600 \(\mu\)m (corresponding to a 10% deterioation in mass resolution) would be ideal. 1 mm seems to be a desireable but not absolutely essential requirement. However, a z resolution of worse than 2 mm is regarded as not acceptable. As can be seen in Table 3 the \(B_{d}^{0}\rightarrow\pi\pi\) mass resolution and the B decay vertex resolution do not constrain this any further (assuming at least one working pixel layer).

A better z resolution would be needed to achieve a reasonable mass resolution for \(K_{S}^{0}\)'s decaying at _large_ radii, but in this case it is possible to use the \(K_{S}^{0}\) decay vertex to efficiently reject the background.

### Placement precision

For two layout options, i. e. the one pixel option and two pixels plus vertex option, the influence of alignment errors on \(B_{d}^{0}\) mass and decay vertex resolution has been studied. Two scenarios of misalignment were taken into account:

* each silicon layer is independently rotated in \(r\varphi\) by a random amount \(\delta_{r\varphi}\)
* each silicon layer is independently moved in x by a random amount \(\delta_{x}\)

Both \(\delta_{r\varphi}\) and \(\delta_{x}\) are generated according to a gaussian distribution with standard deviation \(\sigma_{pl}\). As a function of \(\sigma_{pl}\) the \(B_{d}^{0}\) mass and decay vertex resolution has been computed and is plotted in Figures 14-17.

Allowing the \(B_{d}^{0}\) mass resolution in both decay channels to degrade by a factor of two the plots give an upper limit on the placement precision of about 250 \(\mu\)m. The decay vertex resolution stays within a reasonable range for this value.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{||l|l|l|l|l|} \hline \(\sigma_{z}=600\mu\)m & \(B_{d}^{0}\) mass res (\(B_{d}^{0}\to J/\Psi K_{s}^{0}\)) & optimum + & 10\% & pixel working \\ \cline{3-6}  & & optimum + & 15\% & pixel dead \\ \cline{2-6}  & \(B_{d}^{0}\) mass res. (\(B_{d}^{0}\rightarrow\pi^{+}\pi^{-}\)) & optimum + & 2\% & pixel working \\ \cline{2-6}  & & optimum + & 10\% & pixel dead \\ \cline{2-6}  & \(B_{d}^{0}\) decay vertex res. & & \(\sim 250\mu\)m & pixel working \\ \hline \(\sigma_{z}=1\)mm & \(B_{d}^{0}\) mass res (\(B_{d}^{0}\to J/\Psi K_{s}^{0}\)) & optimum + & 25\% & pixel working \\ \cline{2-6}  & & optimum + & 40\% & pixel dead \\ \cline{2-6}  & \(B_{d}^{0}\) mass res. (\(B_{d}^{0}\rightarrow\pi^{+}\pi^{-}\)) & optimum + & 4\% & pixel working \\ \cline{2-6}  & & optimum + & 15\% & pixel dead \\ \cline{2-6}  & \(B_{d}^{0}\) decay vertex res. & & \(\sim 300\mu\)m & pixel working \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 3: Results for a z resolution of 600 \(\mu\)m and 1 mm (see Figures 10– 13)Conclusions

As presented in Section 4 this study arrives at a minimum silicon strip detector z resolution of about 1 mm corresponding to a loss compared to the ideal case of 25% in \(B_{d}^{0}\to J/\Psi K_{S}^{0}\) mass resolution and 4% in \(B_{d}^{0}\to\pi\pi\) mass resolution. The placement precision of the silicon layers required for a low luminosity second level trigger is in the range of less than 250 \(\mu\)m.

After linearisation of p and g

\[p(q)\approx p(q_{0})+A(q-q_{0})\]

\[g(q)\approx g(q_{0})+b^{t}(q-q_{0})\]

with the 9 x 10 matrix \(A=\frac{\partial p}{\partial q}\Big{|}_{q=q_{0}}\), 9-dim. vector \(b=\frac{\partial q}{\partial q}\Big{|}_{q=q_{0}}\) and \(q_{0}\) as a first estimate for q, an analytical solution of (1) can be calculated

\[q=q_{0}+M^{-1}A^{t}V^{-1}p^{\prime}-\frac{g(q_{0})+b^{t}M^{-1}A^{t}V^{-1}p^{ \prime}}{b^{t}M^{-1}b}M^{-1}b \tag{2}\]

where \(M=A^{t}V^{-1}A\) and \(p^{\prime}=p_{f}-p(q_{0})\).

Computing another iteration using (2) for \(q_{0}\) a better approximation is obtained. After a few iterations q is in general sufficiently close to the correct solution of (1).
