Referee report on ATL-PHYS-PUB-2006-029

Dear Authors,

Enclosed is a rather extensive list of comments. The reason is that I have found your write-up more suitable for a Ph.D. dissertation (in fact that is its source) than for a publishable paper.

General comments:

* Throughout the paper change Br into BR.
* I propose to use a more standard and transparent indexing of the anomalous couplings \(\backslash\)kappa: subscript corresponding to the quarks involved _{tq}..; superscript denoting the gauge boson.
* In the text you use 'branching fraction(s)', more common is use of 'branching ratio(s)'.

In the following the abbreviations will be used: Pg (page), pa (paragraph), L (line).

Abstract, L5 - Correct: we show

Abstract, L7 - Add:...or equivalently the branching ratios BR...

Pg1, footnote: Take out 'corresponding author,', leave only e-mail address.

Pg2, caption to Table1:

* Up to my knowledge all quoted branching ratios are for t decays into c-quarks only. Check this in Ref.[1]!
* Add:...MSSM (\(\not\)
* Change:...Note that the numbers... (see 1\({}^{\rm st}\) remark on the Caption)

Pg2, pa below the table, L4 - Change:...how sensitive is the ATLAS detector [2] to...

Pg2, last two sentences of the Introduction: I would put more weight to the current work in comparison to [4]; e.g. emphasize that not only the TOPREX is used, but that gives sensitivity for the initial low-luminosity running and includes detailed discussion of the systematic uncertainties.

Pg3, subsection 1.1: My proposal is not to make a subsection here, but include this part in the introduction as a separate paragraph after Table 1.

Pg3, Eq.1: This equation is not necessary for a publishable article (never referred to). Take it out and start the paragraph with 'From the effective Lagrangian [6], the top quark decay...

Pg3: I propose to combine section 2 and section 3 into one section: Signal and background simulation.

Pg4, pa1, L3: Give reference to '250 pb' (ATLAS TDR?) and also below for cross-sections quoted for Wbb and Wcc.

Pg4, footnote 1: Referring to the model parameters (CKIN) is not appropriate for the publishable article. Change:'Obtained from PYTHIA for W bosons with... 20 GeV in the hard interaction.

Pg4, last pa of Sec.2, L2 - Correct:...could also arise...

Pg4, Sec.3, 1st sentence: You are not simulating LHC, but pp collisions...

Pg5, caption to Table 2, L2/3: Explain what is the generator cut you are referring to.

Pg5, Table 2: Remove the column 'Proc.no.', also from the text below the table.

Pg5, pa3, L4/5: Remove the parentheses from the last sentence 'Contribution from...' and give a reference to this statement.

Pg5, last pa: In my opinion more details about the ATLFAST simulations should be included.

L3: take out '(NSET=5)'

Pg6, pa below Fig.2, L3/4: Remove parentheses from the sentence 'The neutrino solution...'

Pg7, caption to Fig.4: Question: Is the m\({}_{\rm lv}\) constrained to m\({}_{\rm W}\) on this plot? If yes this constraint

is not defined as the 'initial cuts'.

L2: Correct (to scale) into (not to scale) since on this plot your signal is

multiplied by 20, so it is not to scale with the shown backgrounds.

Pg7, pa below Fig.4, L1- change:...top mass distributions...

L3- change:...of selecting the solution for the neutrino longitudinal

momentum, and partly...

Pg8, pa2, L4: Denoting the signal significance by 'g' is confusing (g is used for gluon), change it into something else, e.g. g\({}_{\rm s}\).

Pg9, L1 below Fig.5 - Add:...efficiency (\(\varepsilon_{\rm s}\)) is 1.20%...

Pg9, last pa of Sec.4: Explain where the errors on the number of signal (+/- 9) and background events (+/-1272) come from. Summing the numbers quoted in the previous paragraph for

different backgrounds does not give 109 158. Check this.

Pg9, Sec.5, L4: Check simple math here and in what follows!

Sqrt(109158)=330 not 309; 309 times 5 =1545 (330x5=1650).

Pg9, L2 from the bottom -Insert space:..be computed...

Pg10, L2 from top, re: 13.7 pb: Check math! For \(\varepsilon_{\rm s}\)=0.012, S=1543(?), sigma \(>\)12.9 pb; sigma \(<\) 4.2 pb.

Pg10, Eq.4: Replace 'g' by whatever you choose (see one of the previous remarks).

Pg10, pa below Eq. 7: I got lost in getting limits on kappa and BR, it is not clearly explained

where from you get the kappa for 5\(\sigma\) (1.645\(\sigma\)).

Pg11, Table 4: remove this table, the final results with systematic errors are shown in Table 9.

Pg11, Sec.6: I propose to not divide this section into subsection 6.1 etc. That is sufficient to separate the text by paragraphs.

Pg11, Sec.6.1: In general I think that this section could be shortened, e.g. by removing Fig.6.

Pg11, Sec.6.1, L3 - Change:...as well as the shape of the distributions of variables used in selection cuts. (I don't like 'kinematical distribution'.)

Pg12, bottom pa: It is not acceptable for the publishable paper to reproduce (copy) the table from other paper. Delete Table 6, and quote only in the text the total errors for t- and s-channel cross sections.

Pg13, Sec.6.3: What is 'Peterson function'? Give reference.

\(\varepsilon_{b}\) was introduced on page 5 as b-tagging efficiency, here it is something else;

explain the meaning of the parameter, use different notation.

Pg13, Sec.6.4: Delete all instances of NSET e.g. replace NSET=1 by \(\varepsilon_{b}=50\%\) etc.

Rewrite this section clearly specifying that nominal value is 60% and no p\({}_{T}\)

dependence; it was not clear whether for 50% and 70 % the p\({}_{T}\) dependence

was included or not (see also my remark below).

Pg14, table 7: Change the column NSET, into 'p\({}_{T}\)-dependence',; rows:

60% - 10 100

60% + 6.7 93

50%................

70%................

Pg 14, Sec.6.5: I would prefer to use 'light-quark jets' instead of 'light-jets'.

Pg14. Sec.6.6, L10: Take out the sentence starting with 'The relevant PYTHIA parameters...'

References: 6, 11, 20 - this is the same reference (even though the pages of interest are different),

should appear only once.

2, 24 - the same as above
