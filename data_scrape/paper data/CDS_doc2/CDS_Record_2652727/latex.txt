Measurement prospects of the pair production and self-coupling of the Higgs boson with the ATLAS experiment at the HL-LHC

The ATLAS Collaboration

###### Abstract

A prospect study for the search for non-resonant Higgs-boson-pair production, using a statistical combination of the \(b\bar{b}b\bar{b}\), \(b\bar{b}\gamma\gamma\) and \(b\bar{b}\tau^{+}\tau^{-}\) final states, is performed assuming 3000 fb\({}^{-1}\) of \(pp\) collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 14 TeV in the ATLAS detector at the High Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC). When systematic uncertainties are neglected, the expected signal significance is found to be 3.5\(\sigma\) while the signal strength relative to the Standard Model prediction is expected to be measured with an accuracy of 31%. The Higgs boson self-coupling can be constrained to \(-0.1\leq\lambda_{HHH}/\lambda_{HHH}^{SM}\leq 2.7\cup 5.5\leq\lambda_{HHH}/ \lambda_{HHH}SM\leq 6.9\), at 95% confidence level, and the measured value of \(\lambda_{HHH}/\lambda_{HHH}^{SM}\) is expected to be \(1.0^{+0.7}_{-0.6}\). If systematic uncertainties are included, the signal significance is found to be 3.0\(\sigma\) while the signal strength relative to the Standard Model expectation is expected to be measured with an accuracy of 40%. In that case, the Higgs boson self-coupling can be constrained to \(-0.4\leq\lambda_{HHH}/\lambda_{HHH}^{SM}\leq 7.3\), at 95% confidence level, and the measured value of \(\lambda_{HHH}/\lambda_{HHH}^{SM}\) is expected to be \(1.0^{+0.9}_{-0.8}\). The \(b\bar{b}\gamma\gamma\) and \(b\bar{b}\tau^{+}\tau^{-}\) final states are further extrapolated to provide first estimates of the prospects at the High Energy LHC, assuming 15 ab\({}^{-1}\) of data at a centre-of-mass collision energy of 27.

## 1 Introduction

The Standard Model (SM) predicts the existence of a quantum field [1, 2, 3, 4] that is responsible for the generation of masses of fundamental particles. This conjecture was tested and confirmed in 2012 with the discovery by the ATLAS and CMS Collaborations at the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC) of a particle associated with this field: the Higgs boson [5, 6].

After the observation, a number of measurements have been performed to quantify the properties of this particle, such as: mass, spin and parity quantum numbers, and couplings.

* Mass: The combination of the measurements of the Higgs boson mass performed by the ATLAS and CMS Collaborations using data collected in 2011-2012 (Run 1) yields a value of: \(m_{H}=125.09\pm 0.21(\text{stat.})\pm 0.11(\text{syst.})\) GeV [7]. This value is consistent with indirect constraints from precision electroweak data. Measurements based on a subset of the Run 2 data can be found in Refs. [8, 9].
* Spin and parity quantum numbers: The spin-parity of the observed particle agrees with the SM hypothesis (spin 0, \(J^{P}=0^{+}\)): the ATLAS and CMS Collaborations exclude several alternative spin and parity hypotheses in favour of the SM hypothesis at more than 99.9% confidence level (CL) [10, 11].
* Couplings: Constraints on the coupling strength of the Higgs boson to vector bosons and fermions based on a combination of measurements by the ATLAS and CMS Collaborations are reported in Ref. [12]. Couplings to vector bosons are found to be compatible with those expected from the SM within an approximate 10% uncertainty, while in the case of the heavier SM fermions (top- and bottom-quarks, and \(\tau\)-leptons) the uncertainty is of the order of 15-20%. Those measurements are being significantly improved using Run 2 data [13, 14], and the couplings to fermions are now definitely established thanks to the recent observations of the tt production and \(H\to b\bar{b}\) decay mode [15, 16, 17, 18]. The measurements of the coupling strengths can be used to constrain Beyond the Standard Model (BSM) scenarios.

In the SM, the physical Higgs field \(H\) interacts with itself generating both mass and self-interaction terms. These terms arise from the Higgs potential in the perturbative expansion of the Higgs doublet \(\phi\) around the electroweak symmetry breaking vacuum expectation value (\(v\)):

\[V(\phi^{\dagger}\phi) = \mu^{2}\phi^{\dagger}\phi+\lambda(\phi^{\dagger}\phi)^{2} \tag{1}\] \[\supset \lambda v^{2}H^{2}+\lambda vH^{3}+\frac{\lambda}{4}H^{4}. \tag{2}\]

The first term in the expansion describes the mass of the Higgs boson, \(m_{H}=\sqrt{2\lambda v^{2}}\). The second and third terms describe the tri-linear and quartic self-interactions of the Higgs boson, with coupling strengths \(\lambda_{HHH}=\kappa_{HHHH}=\lambda\). The vacuum expectation value of the Higgs field is related to the Fermi constant and its value can be inferred from measurements of the muon decay: \(v\simeq 246\) GeV. The perturbative expansion described above implies the following relation between the coupling strengths associated with the Higgs self-interaction vertices, the mass of the Higgs boson and the vacuum expectation value:

\[\lambda_{HHH}=\kappa_{HHHH}=\frac{m_{H}^{2}}{2v^{2}}. \tag{3}\]

Measurements of the Higgs tri-linear and quartic interactions would provide constraints on the shape of the Higgs potential close to the minimum. Measurements of the strengths of the Higgs boson self-interactionsand their comparison to SM predictions are necessary to verify the electroweak symmetry breaking mechanism of the SM. The existence of an extended scalar sector or the presence of new dynamics at higher scales could modify the Higgs boson self-couplings.

The parameters \(\lambda_{HHH}\) and \(\kappa_{HHHH}\) can be constrained via experimental studies of final states arising from the production of two and three Higgs bosons, respectively. However, the corresponding production cross-sections are significantly smaller than those for the production of single Higgs bosons. The production of \(HH\) pairs through gluon-gluon fusion (ggF) has an expected cross-section of \(36.69^{+2.1\%}_{-4.9\%}\) fb at 14 TeV [19]. Even with the higher LHC centre-of-mass energy of 14 TeV and the integrated luminosity expected to be reached by the end of the LHC era, a meaningful extraction of \(\kappa_{HHHH}\) is impossible, but the observation of Higgs-boson-pair production and a determination of \(\lambda_{HHH}\) appear to be feasible.

This note presents prospects for studies of Higgs-boson-pair production at the High Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC), assuming an integrated luminosity of 3000 fb\({}^{-1}\), and using three decay channels: \(b\bar{b}b\bar{b}\), \(b\bar{b}\gamma\gamma\) and \(b\bar{b}\tau^{+}\tau^{-}\). The branching fractions of \(H\to b\bar{b}\), \(H\rightarrow\gamma\gamma\) and \(H\rightarrow\tau^{+}\tau^{-}\) are 0.5824, \(2.27\times 10^{-3}\), and \(6.272\times 10^{-2}\), respectively [20]. These SM branching fractions are assumed for all the results presented. Only the dominant production mode via gluon-gluon fusion is examined. Scans are performed over a range of possible tri-linear self-coupling strengths, measured relative to the SM expectation and denoted by \(\kappa_{\lambda}=\lambda_{HHH}/\lambda_{HHH}^{SM}\).

The current Run 2 measurements of the Higgs-boson-pair production are performed with approximately 36 fb\({}^{-1}\) of data [21, 22], combining different decay channels. The ATLAS collaboration reports the combined observed (expected) limit on the non-resonant Higgs-boson-pair production cross-section of 6.7 (10.4) times the SM expectation. The ratio of the Higgs boson self-coupling to its SM expectation is observed (expected) to be constrained at 95% CL to \(-5.0<\kappa_{\lambda}<12.1\) (\(-5.8<\kappa_{\lambda}<12.0\)). The reported combined observed (expected) limit on the non-resonant Higgs-boson-pair production cross-section by the CMS collaboration is 22.2 (12.8) times the predicted Standard Model cross-section. The ratio of the Higgs boson self-coupling to its SM expectation is observed (expected) to be constrained at 95% CL to \(-11.8<\kappa_{\lambda}<18.8\) (\(-7.1<\kappa_{\lambda}<13.6\)).

The expected performance for the \(b\bar{b}b\bar{b}\) and \(b\bar{b}\tau^{+}\tau^{-}\) channels at the HL-LHC is assessed through extrapolation of measurements [23, 24] performed by the ATLAS Collaboration using \(24.3\) fb\({}^{-1}\) and \(36.1\) fb\({}^{-1}\) of data, respectively, recorded at \(\sqrt{s}=13\) TeV. The expected performance for the \(b\bar{b}\gamma\gamma\) channel is assessed through the use of truth-level Monte Carlo (MC) samples. These MC samples have been adjusted with parameterised functions to estimate the response of the upgraded ATLAS detector at the HL-LHC. The average number of additional proton-proton interactions (pile-up) per bunch crossing is assumed to be <\(\mu\)> = 200. An 8% improvement in \(b\)-tagging efficiency is expected for all channels as a result of improvements to the inner tracker (ITk) [25]. This improvement is factored into the \(b\bar{b}b\bar{b}\) and \(b\bar{b}\tau^{+}\tau^{-}\) extrapolations, and it is included in the smearing functions used in the \(b\bar{b}\gamma\gamma\) analysis. In this note, the current Run 2 systematic uncertainties are scaled following Ref. [26].

## 2 \(Hh\to b\bar{b}b\bar{b}\)

The projections for the \(HH\to b\bar{b}b\bar{b}\) channel presented in this note are extrapolations of the recent results obtained by the ATLAS Collaboration [23] in which 27.5 fb\({}^{-1}\) of \(pp\) collision data recorded at \(\sqrt{s}=13\) TeV in 2015-2016 are used. These results set a 95% CL upper limit of 147 fb (234 fb expected) on the cross-section of SM-like Higgs-boson-pair production, where both Higgs bosons decay to \(b\bar{b}\). Thiscorresponds to 13.0 times (20.7 times) the SM prediction. The CMS Collaboration recently set a 95% CL upper limit of 847 fb (419 fb expected), corresponding to 74.6 (36.9) times the SM prediction (under the same conditions but with an integrated luminosity of \(35.9\,\mathrm{fb}^{-1}\)) [27].

The extrapolations are set using the same methodology as in Ref. [28], but the analysis upon which they are based is updated in line with the improved Run 2 analysis [23]. The assumption is made that the planned upgrades to the ATLAS detector [25, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33] and improvements to reconstruction algorithms will mitigate the effects of higher pile-up, resulting in the same jet reconstruction performance as that achieved in 2015-2016. The \(b\)-tagging efficiency is increased by 8% per jet, while the efficiency to incorrectly tag \(c\)- and light-jets remains the same, in order to reflect the expected improvements in \(b\)-tagging performance afforded by the ITk [25]. Jet transverse momentum (jet-\(p_{\mathrm{T}}\)) thresholds, determined by the trigger requirement, will likely increase for HL-LHC running. The effect of raising jet thresholds is studied below. Furthermore, the assumption is made that the analysis will be unchanged in terms of selection and statistical interpretation - a rather pessimistic assumption given that the analysis will be improved to use new techniques and optimised to make best use of larger datasets (for example the boosted-decision-tree-based background reweighting approach of Ref. [34]).

The results presented here were included in the Pixel Detector TDR [25] and the TDAQ TDR [30].

### Run 2 Analysis

The sensitivity of the \(HH\to b\bar{b}b\bar{b}\) process is extrapolated from the analysis performed on 24.3 fb\({}^{-1}\) of data, collected during 2016 at a centre-of-mass energy of \(\sqrt{s}=13\) TeV and documented in Ref. [23]. MC samples simulated at 13 TeV are used in this analysis to model the signal production and the background from \(t\bar{t}\) events, as described in Ref. [23]. The SM \(HH\) signal sample was generated using Madgraph5_aMC@NLO at next-to-leading order (NLO) in QCD, with the CT10 NLO [35] parton distribution function (PDF) set. Parton showers and hadronization were simulated with Herwig++ [36] using the UEEEE5 set of tuned parameters (tune) [37]. The events were reweighted to reproduce the \(m_{HH}\) spectrum obtained in Refs. [38, 39], which fully accounts for the finite top-quark mass. The dominant multijet background was modelled using the data-driven techniques described in Ref. [23]. This analysis reconstructs each \(b\)-quark from the Higgs boson decays as a distinct \(R=0.4\) anti-\(k_{t}\) jet [40] and has been optimised to search for low-mass and non-resonant Higgs-boson pairs. The mass of the two Higgs boson candidate system (\(m_{HH}\)) is used as the final discriminant. The remainder of this section briefly summarises this analysis, and the reader is directed to Ref. [23] for more details.

A combination of \(b\)-jet triggers is used to record events. Events are required to feature either one \(b\)-tagged jet with transverse momentum \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>225\) GeV, or two \(b\)-tagged jets, either both satisfying \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>35\) GeV or both satisfying \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>55\) GeV, with different requirements on the \(b\)-tagging. Some triggers require additional non-\(b\)-tagged jets. This combination of triggers is 90% efficient for SM non-resonant signal, after the full offline selection described below.

Higgs boson kinematic properties are reconstructed using pairs of \(R=0.4\) anti-\(k_{t}\) jets built from topological clusters of energy deposits in calorimeters cells [41].

Jets containing \(b\)-hadrons are identified using a score value computed from a multivariate \(b\)-tagging algorithm (MV2c10 [42, 43]), which makes use of observables provided by an impact parameter algorithm, an inclusive secondary vertex finding algorithm and a multi-vertex finding algorithm. The \(b\)-tagging working point of 70% \(b\)-jet identification efficiency is chosen.

The selection begins with the requirement that the event contains at least four \(b\)-tagged jets with \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>40\,\mathrm{GeV}\) and \(|\eta|<2.5\). The four jets with the highest \(b\)-tagging scores are paired to construct two Higgs boson candidates as described in Ref. [23].

Higgs-boson pairs are reconstructed over a wide range of masses, \(200\,\mathrm{GeV}\lesssim m_{HH}\lesssim 1300\,\mathrm{GeV}\). Event selection criteria that vary as a function of the reconstructed mass are used to enhance the analysis sensitivity across this range. Mass-dependent requirements are made on the transverse momentum of the leading and sub-leading (in \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\)) Higgs boson candidates. The absolute difference in pseudorapidity between the two Higgs boson candidates is then required to be less than 1.5.

A requirement on the masses of the Higgs boson candidates is made:

\[X_{HH}=\sqrt{\left(\frac{m_{2j}^{\mathrm{lead}}-120\,\mathrm{GeV}}{0.1m_{2j}^{ \mathrm{lead}}}\right)^{2}+\left(\frac{m_{2j}^{\mathrm{subl}}-115\,\mathrm{ GeV}}{0.1m_{2j}^{\mathrm{subl}}}\right)^{2}}<1.6 \tag{4}\]

where \(m_{2j}^{\mathrm{lead}}\) and \(m_{2j}^{\mathrm{subl}}\) are the masses of the leading and subleading Higgs boson candidates, respectively. The \(0.1m_{2j}\) terms represent the expected experimental resolution of the Higgs boson candidate mass.

Finally, to reduce the \(t\bar{t}\) background, hadronically decaying top-quark candidates are built from any three jets in the event, one of which must be a constituent of a Higgs boson candidate. The event is vetoed if a top-quark candidate is found where the reconstructed top-quark and \(W\) boson masses are sufficiently close to their nominal values.

The acceptance times efficiency of the full event selection, including the trigger requirement, is 1.6%. The final analysis discriminant is the invariant mass of the selected four-jet system, \(m_{HH}\), after a correction based on the known Higgs boson mass, where each Higgs boson candidate's four-momentum is multiplied by a correction factor \(m_{H}/m_{2j}\).

After the full event selection, about 95% of the background consists of multijet events. It is difficult to model this background accurately using MC simulation, partly due to the complexity arising from the large number of multijet processes contributing to this background, but mainly due to the need for an extremely large number of events as a result of the large cross-section and high background rejection factor. As a result, the multijet background is modelled using a data-driven method, as described in Ref. [23]. Data featuring Higgs boson candidates reconstructed from exactly two \(b\)-tagged and two non-\(b\)-tagged jets (and satisfying all other selection criteria) are reweighted to represent the background in the signal region. The weights are derived in high-statistics control regions defined using mass sidebands in the \(m_{2j}^{\mathrm{lead}}-m_{2j}^{\mathrm{subl}}\) plane, as shown in Figure 1.

The remaining 5% of the background originates from \(t\bar{t}\) processes. The \(m_{HH}\) spectrum is taken from MC simulation, while the event yield is normalised to data. There is negligible background from all other sources - including processes involving single Higgs bosons.

The uncertainties on the signal acceptance comprise: missing higher-order terms in the matrix elements and PDF set, as well as modelling of the underlying event, hadronic showers, initial- and final-state radiation. The total theoretical uncertainty is dominated by the uncertainties associated with the modelling of the initial- and final-state radiation.

The following detector modelling uncertainties are considered for the simulated signal and \(t\bar{t}\) background: uncertainties in the jet energy scale (JES) and resolution (JER), uncertainties in the \(b\)-tagging efficiency and luminosity uncertainties.

Uncertainties in the normalisation of the multijet and \(t\bar{t}\) backgrounds are propagated from the fit which determines their yields. Shape uncertainties are assessed by deriving an alternative background model using the same procedure as in the nominal case, but from an independent control region. The differences between the baseline and the alternative models are used as a background-model shape uncertainty, with a two-sided uncertainty defined by symmetrising the difference about the baseline. The uncertainty is split into two components to allow two independent variations: a low-\(H_{\mathrm{T}}\) and a high-\(H_{\mathrm{T}}\) component, where \(H_{\mathrm{T}}\) is the scalar sum of the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) of the four jets constituting the pair of Higgs boson candidates. The boundary value is 300 \(\mathrm{GeV}\). The low-\(H_{\mathrm{T}}\) shape uncertainty primarily affects the \(m_{HH}\) spectrum below 400 (close to the kinematic threshold) by up to 5%, and the high-\(H_{\mathrm{T}}\) uncertainty mainly affects \(m_{HH}\) above this by up to 30% relative to nominal. The size of these background normalisation and shape uncertainties are driven by the current statistical precision of the control regions and they were found to be the dominant systematic uncertainties in the analysis of the 2016 dataset.

### Extrapolation Method

The statistical framework used to produce the Run 2 results documented in Ref. [23] is extended to assess the sensitivity of the analysis to non-resonant Higgs-boson-pair production with larger datasets. A test statistic based on the profile likelihood ratio [44] is used to test hypothesised values of the global signal strength factor, \(\mu=\sigma_{HH}/\sigma_{HH}^{SM}\), for the SM non-resonant \(HH\) signal model. Systematic uncertainties are treated using Gaussian or log-normal constraint terms in the definition of the likelihood function. The extended framework is used to produce \(m_{HH}\) distributions for the signal and background, which have been modified to represent different integrated luminosities. These distributions are used to derive expected upper limits on the production cross-section for the signal process using a signal-plus-background fit to the background-only \(m_{HH}\) distribution. Exclusion limits are based on the value of the statistic \(CL_{s}\)[45], with a value of \(\mu\) regarded as excluded at the 95% CL when \(CL_{s}\) is less than 5%. The distributions can

The signal region is inside the inner (red) dashed curve, and two control regions are defined outside the signal region: one outside the signal region and within the orange circle and the other between the orange and yellow circles. The left plot shows the distribution of events for the SM non-resonant \(HH\) process, and the right plot shows the distribution of events for the estimated multijet background.

also be modified to investigate different assumptions and scenarios, for example assumptions related to the evolution of the systematic uncertainties.

The systematic uncertainties related to detector modelling - JES, JER, \(b\)-tagging, luminosity - are themselves largely set by the systematic uncertainties of the methods used to determine them. They could be reduced in the future through dedicated studies and development of new techniques, but since no reliable predictions of these improvements can be made, they are treated as constant in this extrapolation. Even with this conservative assumption, these uncertainties have a negligible impact on the analysis sensitivity.

The multijet and \(t\overline{t}\) distributions have uncertainties associated with their normalisation and shape that are treated as nuisance parameters in the statistical analysis. In order to use the best models of these backgrounds in the dataset extrapolation process, a signal-plus-background fit is performed to the 2016 data (assuming \(\mu=1\)) and the best-fit values of the nuisance parameters extracted. Background distributions are then generated to represent different integrated luminosities, using these best-fit nuisance parameter values. The statistical uncertainties on the data-driven multijet model are set to follow Poisson statistics corresponding to the dataset size, while the systematic uncertainties are left unchanged (additional constraints coming from the fit to 2016 data are ignored). Different assumptions regarding the evolution of the background uncertainties are explored in Section 2.4.

The signal model statistical uncertainty is dictated by MC resource limitations. As these will be substantially improved for the final HL-LHC analyses, the statistical uncertainty on the signal distributions is neglected.

All background distributions are corrected to account for the increase in collision energy from \(\sqrt{s}=13\,\mathrm{TeV}\) to \(\sqrt{s}=14\,\mathrm{TeV}\). For simplicity this is done by scaling the number of expected events by 1.18, which accounts for the increase in cross-sections due to the change in gluon-luminosity. The signal distributions are normalised to the \(\sqrt{s}=14\,\mathrm{TeV}\) prediction [19]. Possible effects on the \(m_{HH}\) shape from the evolution of the PDFs are neglected for this study.

The \(m_{HH}\) distributions extrapolated to \(3000\,\mathrm{fb}^{-1}\) are shown in Figure 2, and retain the same binning that was used in the Run 2 analysis. These scaled distributions are used in the statistical analysis along with those corresponding to systematic uncertainty variations. The signal-to-background ratio for all events is 0.06%, increasing to 0.19% if only events with \(m_{HH}>400\,\mathrm{GeV}\) are considered. The low-\(H_{\mathrm{T}}\) uncertainty is constrained to 0.15 of the prior and the high-\(H_{\mathrm{T}}\) uncertainty is constrained to 0.03 of the prior. The uncertainty on the overall background yield, when the Run 2 uncertainty is extrapolated to 3000 fb\({}^{-1}\), is found to be 0.3%.

### Results

The expected 95% CL upper limit on the global SM \(HH\) signal strength as a function of the integrated luminosity is shown in Figure 3 for the best possible scenario where only statistical uncertainties are considered and for the conservative scenario where the pre-fit uncertainties remain as they were for the analysis of the 2016 dataset. The potential benefit of reducing the pre-fit systematic uncertainties is significant and becomes even more pronounced with larger datasets: the sensitivity with 3000 fb\({}^{-1}\) of data and the current systematic uncertainties is 2.5 times worse than in the scenario where systematic uncertainties are negligible. If systematic uncertainties were entirely eliminated, the excluded signal strength would be 1.4 with 3000 fb\({}^{-1}\) of data.

Figure 4 shows a similar set of plots for the projected significance of the discrepancy from the background-only hypothesis. The potential benefit of reducing the systematic uncertainties is once again highlighted. If systematic uncertainties were entirely eliminated, the significance would be \(1.4\sigma\). The corresponding probability, \(p_{0}\), to observe the predicted SM \(HH\) signal because of fluctuations in the background is

The red line shows the upper limit when evaluated without systematic uncertainties, while the green line assumes that the pre-fit systematic uncertainties remain as they were in 2016. The lower panel shows the ratio between these two limits. The extrapolated sensitivity is shown using a jet \(p_{\rm T}\) threshold of 40 GeV.

0.0825. Keeping the current experimental systematic uncertainties, this becomes 0.62\(\sigma\), corresponding to a \(p_{0}\)-value of 0.269.

With 3000 fb\({}^{-1}\) of data, a degradation of the \(b\)-tagging efficiency to its Run 2 performance (assessed by removing the 8% improvement that was applied earlier) would result in a relative decrease by 10% (20%) of the significance for the case of current (no) systematic uncertainty.

To assess the sensitivity of the \(HH\to b\bar{b}b\bar{b}\) analysis to \(\kappa_{\lambda}\), samples for three different values of \(\kappa_{\lambda}\) (\(\kappa_{\lambda}=0\), 1 and 10) are produced using the leading-order (LO) version of Madgraph5_aMC@NLO [46] generator with the NNPDF 2.3 LO [47] PDF set and Pythia 8 [48] for the showering model. Using these three samples, the generator-level \(m_{HH}\) distributions for \(-20\leq\kappa_{\lambda}\leq 20\) were then produced using the morphing technique documented in Ref. [49]. The binned ratios of \(m_{HH}\) distributions for any given \(\kappa_{\lambda}\) value to the SM case (\(\kappa_{\lambda}=1\)) are computed at LO and then applied to the fully simulated SM NLO sample to reweight it to different \(\kappa_{\lambda}\) values. In this way the SM NLO QCD and the finite top-quark mass corrections [38, 39] are applied for all \(\kappa_{\lambda}\) signals, i.e. they are assumed to be independent of \(\kappa_{\lambda}\).

An Asimov dataset with the predicted SM \(HH\) signal was created, and maximum likelihood fits to this dataset were performed with different \(\kappa_{\lambda}\) hypotheses. The negative natural logarithm of the ratio of the maximum likelihood for \(\kappa_{\lambda}\) to that for the fit with \(\kappa_{\lambda}=1\) is shown in Figure 5. The \(1\sigma\) and \(2\sigma\) confidence interval (CI) constraints on \(\kappa_{\lambda}\) from these curves, when considering only statistical uncertainties and when considering current pre-fit systematic uncertainties, are shown in Table 1.

The negative natural logarithm of the ratio of the maximum likelihood for \(\kappa_{\lambda}\) to that for the fit with \(\kappa_{\lambda}=0\) is shown in Figure 6. The confidence intervals on \(\kappa_{\lambda}\) are reported in Table 2

It can be seen in Figures 5 and 6 that there are typically two minima. The first minimum is located at \(\kappa_{\lambda}=1\) or 0, respectively, as the signal hypothesis used in the maximum likelihood fit corresponds to the

Figure 4: Expected significance, \(p_{0}\), of the discrepancy from the background-only hypothesis when the predicted SM \(HH\) signal is injected, as a function of the integrated luminosity of the search between 47 and 3000 fb\({}^{-1}\). The red line shows \(p_{0}\) when evaluated without systematic uncertainties, while the green line assumes that the pre-fit systematic uncertainties remain as they were in 2016. The black dashed line shows the \(p_{0}\) value corresponding to a signal significance of \(1\sigma\). The extrapolated sensitivity is shown using a jet \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) threshold of 40 GeV.

signal used to create the Asimov dataset. The second minimum is observed at a \(\kappa_{\lambda}\) value that corresponds to a similar fitted signal yield with respect to the \(\kappa_{\lambda}\) point at the first minimum, which is a consequence of a higher cross-section, but lower acceptance and worse signal-to-background separation. The degeneracy is lifted because of the different shapes of the \(m_{HH}\) distribution at each of the two minima, especially after including the systematic uncertainties.

### Impact of Reducing Background Modelling Uncertainties

Systematic uncertainties related to the data-driven background modelling are dominant, with the other sources (theoretical or detector modelling uncertainties) leading to a negligible change in the results.

The dashed lines at \(-\ln(L_{\kappa_{\lambda}}/L_{\kappa_{\lambda}=1})=0.5\) and \(2.0\) indicate the values corresponding to a \(1\sigma\) and \(2\sigma\) confidence interval, respectively (assuming an asymptotic \(\chi^{2}\) distribution of the test statistic).

The impact of potential reductions in the background modelling uncertainties is shown in Figure 7. The multijet background modelling uncertainties were determined in 2016 by examining the agreement between the background models derived in two different regions of the plane defined by the masses of the two Higgs boson candidates. The uncertainties were essentially limited by the statistical precision of these comparisons. As more data is accumulated, the statistical precision of these comparisons will increase and a reduction in the modelling uncertainties should be possible. Hence, the limit achievable for the case where the background uncertainties are scaled according to the integrated luminosity is also shown as the star in Figure 7.

### Effect of Minimum Jet \(\pt\) Thresholds

The high number of pile-up events at HL-LHC cause difficulties in maintaining high acceptance when triggering on multijet final states. Jets produced in the pile-up events cause high trigger rates, potentially necessitating a rise in jet \(\pt\) thresholds, which is exacerbated by the deterioration in trigger \(\pt\) turn-on curves caused by the additional soft energy deposited in the calorimeters.

The impact of increasing the multijet trigger \(\pt\) thresholds has been examined by repeating the analysis using different minimum jet \(\pt\) requirements on the constituent jets of the Higgs boson candidates. The expected 95% CL upper limit on \(\sigma_{HH}/\sigma_{HH}^{SM}\), as a function of the minimum jet \(\pt\) required is shown in Figure 8. Ref. [50] proposes a trigger menu with a multijet trigger that requires four jets, all satisfying a minimum \(\pt\) threshold equivalent to demanding \(\pt>75\GeV\) for jets reconstructed offline. As can be seen in Figure 8, this high minimum jet \(\pt\) threshold would have a significant negative impact on the sensitivity of the \(HH\to b\bar{b}b\bar{b}\) analysis. In the scenario with no systematic uncertainties, this degrades the sensitivity by almost 50% relative to the current analysis threshold of \(\pt>40\GeV\) and is equivalent to halving the integrated luminosity of the final dataset. In the scenario with the current systematic uncertainties, the limits are 2.4 times higher, equivalent to reducing the dataset to only \(200\,\fb^{-1}\). The larger degradation

Figure 6: Negative natural logarithm of the ratio of the maximum likelihood for \(\kappa_{\lambda}\) to the maximum likelihood for \(\kappa_{\lambda}=0\) for (left) the fits with only statistical uncertainties and (right) the fits with current systematic uncertainties as nuisance parameters. These extrapolated likelihood curves are produced with a jet \(\pt\) threshold of \(40\GeV\). The dashed lines at \(-\ln(L_{\kappa_{\lambda}}/L_{\kappa_{\lambda}=0})=0.5\) and 2.0 indicate the values corresponding to a \(1\sigma\) and \(2\sigma\) confidence interval, respectively (assuming an asymptotic \(\chi^{2}\) distribution of the test statistic).

in this case can be quantitatively explained by the background systematic uncertainty being currently dominated by the statistical precision of the comparison between the two models; so increasing the jet \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) threshold results in a loss of sensitivity from diminishing the precision of that comparison, as well as the expected hit from reduced signal region yields.

The left plot shows the case where only statistical uncertainties are considered, while the right plot includes the pre-fit systematic uncertainties as they were in 2016.

Figure 7: Expected 95% CL upper limit on \(\sigma_{HH}/\sigma_{HH}^{SM}\), as a function of the pre-fit background modelling uncertainties, which are each scaled by a common, constant factor relative to the corresponding uncertainty in the Run 2 analysis (i.e. the uncertainties of the analysis of the 2016 dataset correspond to 1 here). The limit achievable assuming that the overall uncertainty scales with luminosity as \(1/\sqrt{L}\) is shown by the star point. The limit obtained when considering only statistical uncertainties is shown as the dashed line. The extrapolated sensitivities are calculated assuming a jet \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) threshold of 40 GeV.

## 3 \(Hh\to b\bar{b}\tau^{+}\tau^{-}\)

The ATLAS \(HH\to b\bar{b}\tau^{+}\tau^{-}\) analysis [24] currently sets the world's strongest limit by a single channel on Higgs-boson-pair production. The results, obtained using 36.1 fb\({}^{-1}\) of \(pp\) collision data at \(\sqrt{s}=13\,\mathrm{TeV}\) collected during the LHC Run 2 in 2015 and 2016, constrain the production cross-section for non-resonant Higgs-boson-pair production to be less than 12.7 times the SM prediction, at 95% CL. The expected limit is 14.8 times the SM prediction. The CMS experiment excludes cross-sections greater than 31.4 times the SM prediction, while the expected limit is 25.1 times the SM prediction, under the same experimental conditions and for a similar integrated luminosity [51].

The results from the ATLAS Run 2 (2015+2016) analysis are extrapolated to \(\sqrt{s}\) = 14 TeV and the HL-LHC target integrated luminosity to obtain an estimate of the expected sensitivity of the \(HH\to b\bar{b}\tau^{+}\tau^{-}\) channel to SM \(HH\) production and \(\lambda_{HHH}\) at the HL-LHC. The \(\tau_{\mathrm{\rm{lep}}}\tau_{\mathrm{had}}\) and \(\tau_{\mathrm{had}}\tau_{\mathrm{had}}\) decay channels are considered, where the subscripts (lep = electron or muon, had = hadrons) indicate the decay mode of the \(\tau\)-lepton. The analysis strategy is briefly summarised below for convenience, Ref. [24] should be consulted for full details.

### Run 2 Analysis

Events are characterised by the presence of either an electron or muon plus hadronic \(\tau\)-object (\(\tau_{\mathrm{had-vis}}\)), or two \(\tau_{\mathrm{had-vis}}\), as well as two \(b\)-tagged jets, and \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\) from neutrinos produced in the \(\tau\)-lepton decay. Events in the \(\tau_{\mathrm{\rm{lep}}}\tau_{\mathrm{had}}\) channel are required to pass a single-lepton trigger (SLT) or lepton-plus-\(\tau_{\mathrm{had-vis}}\) trigger (LTT). The electron or muon that passes the SLT condition is required to have \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>26\,\mathrm{GeV}\) at trigger level. Events that fail this requirement are considered for the LTT category if the electron (muon) has \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>17\) (14)\(\,\mathrm{GeV}\). In the \(\tau_{\mathrm{had}}\) channel events are required to pass either a single-\(\tau_{\mathrm{had-vis}}\) trigger (STT) with the leading \(\tau_{\mathrm{had-vis}}\) required to have \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>80-160\,\mathrm{GeV}\) (depending on the data-taking period of the Run 2 analysis) or a di-\(\tau_{\mathrm{had-vis}}\) trigger (DTT) with the leading (sub-leading) \(\tau_{\mathrm{had-vis}}\) required to have \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>35\) (25)\(\,\mathrm{GeV}\). An additional jet with online \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>25\,\mathrm{GeV}\) is required at Level 1 for LTT and DTT events in order to keep manageable rates.

In the SLT and LTT channels, the electron or muon is required to have a minimum \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) of at least 1 \(\,\mathrm{GeV}\) more than the trigger threshold. In SLT events the \(\tau_{\mathrm{had-vis}}\) is required to have \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>20\,\mathrm{GeV}\), while in the LTT channel the \(\tau_{\mathrm{had-vis}}\) is required to have \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>30\,\mathrm{GeV}\). In the STT channel the leading \(\tau_{\mathrm{had-vis}}\) is required to have \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>100-180\,\mathrm{GeV}\) (depending on the data-taking period of the Run 2 analysis) and the sub-leading \(\tau_{\mathrm{had-vis}}\) is required to have \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>20\,\mathrm{GeV}\). In the DTT channel the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) thresholds for the leading and sub-leading \(\tau_{\mathrm{had-vis}}\) are 40\(\,\mathrm{GeV}\) and 30\(\,\mathrm{GeV}\), respectively. In all cases, the \(\tau\)-lepton decay products are required to have opposite-sign charge and events with additional electrons, muons or \(\tau_{\mathrm{had-vis}}\) are rejected. Signal region (SR) events are required to have two \(b\)-tagged jets, where the leading (sub-leading) jet \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) is required to be at least 45 (20)\(\,\mathrm{GeV}\). In LTT and DTT channels, the leading jet \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) threshold is raised to 80\(\,\mathrm{GeV}\) in order to be fully efficient with respect to the Level 1 requirements. The invariant mass of the di-\(\tau\)-lepton system, \(m_{\tau\tau}^{\mathrm{MMC}}\), is calculated using the Missing Mass Calculator [52], and is required to be greater than 60\(\,\mathrm{GeV}\).

The dominant SM background processes are \(t\bar{t}\), multijet and \(Z\) bosons produced in association with twojets originating from heavy-flavour quarks (\(bb\), \(bc\), \(cc\)), subsequently referred to as \(Z\)+heavy-flavour1. The SM Higgs-boson production is also an important background process, in particular when the Higgs boson is produced in association with a \(Z\) boson and the system subsequently decays into a \(b\bar{b}\tau^{+}\tau^{-}\) final state. To model the SM \(HH\) signal and background processes containing hadronic \(\tau\)-lepton decays MC samples with a fully simulated detector response are used. The SM \(HH\) signal events were generated using Madgraph5_aMC@NLO at NLO in QCD, using the same setup used to generate the SM \(HH\to b\bar{b}b\bar{b}\) signal events, which is described in Section 2.1. The events were reweighted to reproduce the \(m_{HH}\) spectrum obtained in Refs. [38, 39], which fully accounts for the finite top-quark mass. The complete list of MC samples used in the analysis can be found in Ref. [24]. Contributions from processes in which a quark- or gluon-initiated jet is misidentified as a \(\tau_{\text{had-vis}}\) candidate (fake-\(\tau_{\text{had-vis}}\)) are estimated using data-driven methods.

Footnote 1: Equivalently, \(Z\) bosons produced in association with at least one light-flavour quark (\(u\), \(d\) or \(s\)) or gluon are referred to as \(Z\)+light-flavour.

A Boosted Decision Tree (BDT) classification is used to separate the signal from background processes. In all channels the BDT uses the mass of the Higgs-boson pair, \(m_{\tau\tau}^{\text{MMC}}\), the di-\(b\)-jet invariant mass, the angular distance \(\Delta R\equiv\sqrt{(\Delta\eta)^{2}+(\Delta\phi)^{2}}\) between the two visible \(\tau\)-lepton decay products, and the \(\Delta R\) between the two \(b\)-jets. In the \(\tau_{\text{lep}}\tau_{\text{had}}\) channel the transverse mass between the electron or muon and the \(E_{\text{T}}^{\text{miss}}\) is also used. In the \(\tau_{\text{had}}\tau_{\text{had}}\) channel the \(E_{\text{T}}^{\text{miss}}\phi\) centrality that quantifies the angular position of the \(E_{\text{T}}^{\text{miss}}\) relative to the visible \(\tau\)-lepton decay products in the transverse plane is used in the BDT as well. In the \(\tau_{\text{lep}}\tau_{\text{had}}\) channel the BDT is trained against the dominant \(t\bar{t}\) background, while in the \(\tau_{\text{had}}\tau_{\text{had}}\) channel it is trained against \(t\bar{t}\), \(Z/\gamma^{*}\to\tau^{+}\tau^{-}\), and multijet processes.

### Extrapolation Procedure

The expected HL-LHC sensitivity to a SM \(HH\) signal in the \(b\bar{b}\tau^{+}\tau^{-}\) final state is estimated by extrapolating the current Run 2 result [24] using the same statistical framework, based on the profile likelihood ratio [44]. This framework is used to produce modified BDT distributions for signal and background representing different target luminosities. These distributions are used to set upper limits on the signal strength, \(\sigma_{HH}/\sigma_{HH}^{SM}\) (the \(HH\) production cross-section relative to the SM prediction), using the \(CL_{\text{s}}\) method [45]. The expected discovery significance assuming a SM \(HH\) signal is also quoted. Various extrapolation assumptions are investigated.

The Run 2 BDT distributions for signal and background are scaled to luminosities up to 3000 fb\({}^{-1}\) by a single multiplicative factor, defined as the ratio of the target luminosity to the luminosity of the Run 2 result. In the baseline scenario, the uncertainty on the luminosity is assumed to be 1%. The performance of the HL-LHC detector is assumed to be broadly similar to that of the current detector, with the exception that the \(b\)-tagging efficiency is expected to improve by 8% for a given \(c\)- and light-jet rejections due to the upgraded inner tracker, after taking into account effects from high pile-up conditions at the HL-LHC. This is taken into account by conservatively assuming all backgrounds have two \(b\)-initiated jets and hence scaling the backgrounds and the signal by \((1.08)^{2}\). Although there is potential to reduce the systematic uncertainties related to modelling of the detector response by the methods employed, the Run 2 values are used in this study as they are currently limited by the methods rather than statistical precision.

The increase in centre-of-mass energy from \(\sqrt{s}\) = 13 TeV to \(\sqrt{s}\) = 14 TeV is accounted for by scaling the number of expected signal and background events (estimated using simulations at \(\sqrt{s}\) = 13 TeV) by the ratio of the corresponding production cross-sections. In the case of the \(HH\) signal and the single-Higgs-bosonbackgrounds, the latest LHC Higgs Cross-Section Working Group [19] recommendations are used; for other backgrounds a single factor of 1.18 is applied to account for the approximate cross-section increase arising from the enhanced gluon-luminosity. The effect on the shape of several kinematic and BDT input variables was checked at truth level for both signals and major backgrounds. Since no significant difference was found, the shape of the BDT distributions is assumed to be unchanged. The theoretical uncertainty on the signal cross-section is not taken into account for the presented results, but its potential impact on the expected upper limit on the signal strength was estimated and found to be negligible compared to other systematic uncertainties.

In the Run 2 analysis, the binning used for the fit is determined by checking that the pre-fit relative background statistical uncertainty in each bin of the BDT output score is less than 0.5 (0.4) times the fraction of the signal in that bin for the \(\tau_{\text{had}}\tau_{\text{had}}\) (\(\tau_{\text{lep}}\tau_{\text{had}}\)) channel. Additionally, the number of expected background events in each bin is required to be greater than 5 (10) for the \(\tau_{\text{had}}\tau_{\text{had}}\) (\(\tau_{\text{lep}}\tau_{\text{had}}\)) channel. The binning criteria for the extrapolation is kept the same, but the binning itself changes due to the scaling of expected background events. Therefore, the statistical sensitivity improves beyond what is expected from just an increase in cross-section and luminosity.

In the Run 2 analysis, the normalisation of the simulated background samples from \(t\bar{t}\) and \(Z\)+heavy-flavour production is allowed to freely float in the final profile-likelihood fit, as described in Ref. [24]. For simplicity, in the extrapolation the \(Z\)+heavy-flavour background is scaled by the normalisation factor of 1.34 obtained in the Run 2 analysis, while the \(t\bar{t}\) normalisation is taken from simulation since its Run 2 normalisation factor is consistent with unity. The relative uncertainty on the normalisation is incorporated in the fit as a nuisance parameter for both backgrounds. Since the normalisations are obtained from a fit to data in a control region, their uncertainty is of statistical nature and therefore expected to be reduced. The extrapolation takes into account the effective increase in luminosity due to the larger dataset, the higher centre-of-mass energy, and the improvement in the \(b\)-jet identification described above. This increase leads to a reduction factor of approximately 10 in \(t\bar{t}\) and \(Z\)+heavy-flavour normalisation uncertainty at 3000 fb\({}^{-1}\) for the baseline scenario. In the same scenario, the uncertainties accounting for acceptance differences between the control regions and the various signal regions are taken to be 50% of those derived in the Run 2 analysis, based on the assumption that the theoretical modelling of these processes will be improved.

Background processes with a quark- or gluon-initiated jet misidentified as a \(\tau_{\text{had-vis}}\) were derived from data using fake-factor and fake-rate methods in the Run 2 analysis. In order to take into account the expected increase in statistics with higher luminosity, the statistical uncertainties on the data-driven fake-\(\tau_{\text{had-vis}}\) background model in the baseline scenario are adjusted to follow Poisson statistics corresponding to the target dataset size; the systematic uncertainties are left unchanged. The binning of the BDT discriminant is conservatively always determined using the unscaled relative background MC statistical uncertainty.

In the Run 2 analysis, the uncertainty on the background due to single-Higgs-boson production in the \(ZH\) and \(t\bar{t}H\) modes was set to approximately the current measured ATLAS uncertainty on the signal strength in the relevant channel, i.e. to 28% and 30% respectively. In order to account for the expected improvement in these measurements with increased luminosity, the baseline scenario instead assumes 5% and 10% respectively, corresponding approximately to the recommended theory uncertainties [19]. The uncertainties on all other minor backgrounds are halved in this scenario. Finally, in the baseline scenario, the MC statistical uncertainties are neglected under the assumption that the size of the MC samples will increase significantly in line with the data luminosity.

In addition to the baseline scenario, an alternative conservative extrapolation is performed. Here, all systematic uncertainties are set to their Run 2 values unless otherwise stated. Analogously, the statistical uncertainties on the data-driven fake-\(\tau_{\text{had-vis}}\) background are also set to their Run 2 value in this case. This extrapolation is split into two scenarios, one where the Run 2 MC statistical uncertainties are conservatively adopted and the other where they continue to be neglected. In all scenarios, additional constraints on the systematic uncertainties coming from the Run 2 fit are not taken into account. In order to show the ultimate limit of the expected performance, a final extrapolation is performed neglecting all systematic uncertainties, including the MC statistical uncertainty.

### Systematics and Results

For each extrapolation scenario, a profile-likelihood fit is applied to the BDT score distributions shown in Figure 9 based on a background-only Asimov dataset. The fit is performed simultaneously in the three SRs to extract the signal cross-section. All sources of uncertainties are incorporated in the fit as nuisance parameters, as described in Section 3.2. Table 3 shows the number of events in each event category (\(\tau_{\text{rep}}\tau_{\text{had}}\) SLT channel, \(\tau_{\text{lep}}\tau_{\text{had}}\) LTT channel, \(\tau_{\text{had}}\tau_{\text{had}}\) channel) in the baseline scenario, after applying the selection criteria described in Section 3.1. The numbers for the background are derived after the fit to the background-only Asimov dataset. The signal is estimated using a fit to an Asimov dataset with \(\mu=1\). The numbers are shown first for the entire SR, then for the last two bins of the BDT distribution where the BDT score is higher and finally only for the bin with the highest BDT score.

Figure 10 presents the upper limits on the \(HH\) production cross-section normalised to the SM expectation as a function of the luminosity. The four extrapolation scenarios described above are shown: the scenario in which the systematic uncertainties remain the same as for the Run 2 analysis ("current systematic uncertainties"); the scenario with the current systematic uncertainties but neglected MC statistical uncertainties ("MC statistical uncertainty neglected"); the baseline scenario for the systematic uncertainties ("baseline"); and the scenario with no systematic uncertainties considered ("no systematic uncertainties"). In the absence of the SM \(HH\) signal, the analysis is expected to set a 95% CL upper limit at 0.99 times the

The background distributions are shown after the fit based on a background-only Asimov dataset and the signal is scaled to the SM prediction. The hatched bands represent the combined statistical and systematic uncertainty for the baseline scenario. These uncertainty bands are included in the plots for completeness but are very small.

Table 3: Post-fit expected number of events for the HL-LHC target integrated luminosity of 3000 fb\({}^{-1}\) after applying the selection criteria described in Section 3.1. The first part of the table shows the total number of events, the second shows the number of events in the last two bins of the BDT distribution and the third shows only the bin with the highest BDT score. In the \(\tau_{\rm lep}\tau_{\rm had}\) channel, the “Fake-\(\tau_{\rm had\mbox{-}vis}\)” background includes all processes (\(t\bar{t}\), multijets and \(W\)+jets) in which a jet is misidentified as a \(\tau_{\rm had\mbox{-}vis}\), while in the \(\tau_{\rm had}\tau_{\rm had}\) case the fake-\(\tau_{\rm had\mbox{-}vis}\) background from multijet processes (“Multijet Fake-\(\tau_{\rm had\mbox{-}vis}\)”) and \(t\bar{t}\) production (“\(t\bar{t}\) Fake-\(\tau_{\rm had\mbox{-}vis}\)”) are derived separately. The \(t\bar{t}\) background includes events with true \(\tau_{\rm had\mbox{-}vis}\) and the very small contribution from leptons misidentified as \(\tau_{\rm had\mbox{-}vis}\). The ‘Other’ category includes contributions from \(W\)+jets (including fake \(\tau_{\rm had\mbox{-}vis}\) in the \(\tau_{\rm had}\tau_{\rm had}\) channel), \(Z\to\tau\tau+\)light-flavour jets, \(Z\to\ell\ell\)+jets and diboson processes. The total background is not identical to the sum of the individual components since the latter are rounded for presentation, while the sum is calculated with the full precision before being subsequently rounded. Systematic uncertainties as defined in the baseline scenario are included in the fit. Due to the large correlations, individual uncertainties can be significantly larger than the total uncertainty.

SM expectation with 3000 fb\({}^{-1}\) of data for the baseline scenario. The \(\tau_{\rm had}\tau_{\rm had}\) channel is most sensitive and can set an upper limit at 1.1 times the SM expectation. The expected significance, \(p_{0}\), is shown in Figure 11 as a function of the integrated luminosity. The \(2\sigma\) threshold can be reached for the baseline scenario and the full HL-LHC dataset. All results are summarised in Table 4.

The effects of various categories of uncertainty in the baseline scenario are summarised in Table 5. The individual sources of uncertainty making up the categories listed in the table are grouped in the final fit to determine their correlated combined effect on the signal strength. The statistical uncertainty on the data is the dominant uncertainty in the fit.

The degradation of the \(b\)-tagging efficiency to its Run 2 values was assessed by removing the 8% improvement that was applied earlier. This would result in a relative decrease by up to 8% of the significance for 3000 fb\({}^{-1}\) of data.

### Sensitivity to the Self-Coupling \(\lambda_{HHH}\)

Variations in the tri-linear Higgs boson self-coupling strength, \(\kappa_{\lambda}=\lambda_{HHH}/\lambda_{HHH}^{SM}\), can be probed in addition to testing for the presence of a SM \(HH\) signal. When probing \(\lambda_{HHH}\neq\lambda_{HHH}^{SM}\), the top-quark

Results are shown for each extrapolation scenario where the \(\tau_{\rm hep}\tau_{\rm had}\) and \(\tau_{\rm had}\tau_{\rm had}\) channels are combined (left) and for the \(\tau_{\rm hep}\tau_{\rm had}\) channel, the \(\tau_{\rm had}\tau_{\rm had}\) channel and their combination separately for the baseline scenario (right).

Yukawa coupling is set to its SM value, while the effective Higgs boson self-coupling is changed by applying \(\kappa_{\lambda}\) as a scale factor.

Samples for three different values of \(\kappa_{\lambda}\) (\(\kappa_{\lambda}=0\), 1 and 20) are produced at the generator-level using the LO version of Madgraph5_aMC@NLO [46] with the same setup as described in Section 2.3. Samples for any other \(\kappa_{\lambda}\) value of interest are emulated by a linear combination of these three samples. Furthermore, following the procedure described in Section 2.3, the binned ratios of \(m_{HH}\) distributions for any given \(\kappa_{\lambda}\) value to the SM case (\(\kappa_{\lambda}=1\)) are computed at LO and then applied to the fully simulated SM NLO sample to reweight it to different \(\kappa_{\lambda}\) values, taking into account the SM NLO QCD and the finite top-quark mass corrections and assuming them to be independent of \(\kappa_{\lambda}\).

The Run 2 results are extrapolated in order to estimate the sensitivity of the analysis to the Higgs boson self-coupling strength at the HL-LHC. Only the two most sensitive event categories are used for the extrapolation: the SLT category in the \(\tau_{\rm lep}\tau_{\rm had}\) channel and the \(\tau_{\rm had}\tau_{\rm had}\) channel. The default BDT trained with the SM \(HH\) signal with \(\kappa_{\lambda}=1\) is replaced by another BDT trained with the BSM \(HH\) signal generated with \(\kappa_{\lambda}=20\). The new BDT training increases the sensitivity of the analysis to the softer \(m_{HH}\) spectrum and provides a similar performance as BDTs trained specifically for each \(\kappa_{\lambda}\) value. The signal acceptance times efficiency varies significantly as a function of \(m_{HH}\) as shown in Figure 12. The analysis sensitivity is driven by the high \(m_{HH}\) region with a low background contamination. Therefore there is no significant gain from targeting a specific (\(\kappa_{\lambda}\) dependent) \(m_{HH}\) distribution.

The 95% CL expected upper limits on the \(HH\) production cross-section as a function of \(\kappa_{\lambda}\) are shown in Figure 13. The limits become significantly weaker for values of \(\kappa_{\lambda}\) that correspond to a softer \(m_{HH}\)

spectrum, as expected from the decrease of the signal acceptance times efficiency and worse signal-to-background separation. All four scenarios for the systematic uncertainties discussed in Section 3.2 are considered.

To estimate the sensitivity of the analysis to the Higgs boson self-coupling, two different likelihood ratio tests are performed. In the first case the Asimov dataset is created from the backgrounds and the SM \(HH\) signal. The maximum likelihood fits to this dataset are performed with different \(\kappa_{\lambda}\) hypotheses. The ratio of the maximum likelihood for various \(\kappa_{\lambda}\) values to that for the \(\kappa_{\lambda}=1\) value is used to set the \(\kappa_{\lambda}\) confidence intervals assuming the SM \(HH\) signal. The negative natural logarithm of this ratio is shown in Figure 14 on the left. Similarly, another Asimov dataset is built from the backgrounds and the \(\kappa_{\lambda}=0\) configuration. After performing the maximum likelihood fits to this dataset, the negative natural logarithm of the ratio of the maximum likelihood for various \(\kappa_{\lambda}\) values to that for the \(\kappa_{\lambda}=0\) hypothesis is used to set the \(\kappa_{\lambda}\) confidence intervals for the case where the \(\kappa_{\lambda}=0\) configuration, i.e. no Higgs boson self-coupling, is assumed. This is shown in Figure 14 on the right.

It can be seen from Figure 14 that in both cases two minima are observed. In the left (right) plot the first minimum is at \(\kappa_{\lambda}=1\) (\(\kappa_{\lambda}=0\)) as the signal hypothesis used in the maximum likelihood fit corresponds to the signal used to create the Asimov dataset. The second minimum is observed at a \(\kappa_{\lambda}\) value that corresponds to a higher cross-section, but lower acceptance and worse signal-to-background separation due to a softer \(m_{HH}\) spectrum with respect to the \(\kappa_{\lambda}\) point at the first minimum. This leads to a similar fitted signal yield between the two \(\kappa_{\lambda}\) values and consequently a similar maximum likelihood result. For

Figure 13: The 95% CL expected upper limits on the \(HH\) production cross-section are shown as function of \(\kappa_{\lambda}\). The value \(\kappa_{\lambda}=1\) corresponds to the SM prediction. The cross-section for \(HH\) production predicted as a function of \(\kappa_{\lambda}\) is superimposed on the limits. Four different scenarios for the systematic uncertainties are considered. From these results, the allowed \(\kappa_{\lambda}\) interval at 95% CL is expected to be \(1.0<\kappa_{\lambda}<7.0\) in the baseline scenario, and \(1.4<\kappa_{\lambda}<6.3\) if systematic uncertainties are not considered.

all other \(\kappa_{\lambda}\) points the expected signal yield is either lower or higher, thus the likelihood ratio is greater. The confidence intervals on \(\kappa_{\lambda}\) are given in Tables 6 and 7.

### Impact of Trigger Thresholds

Maintaining high signal acceptance when triggering on hadronic final states at the HL-LHC will be difficult due to the high number of pile-up events. Triggering on final states with hadronically decaying \(\tau\)-leptons generally causes high trigger rates and it is therefore a limiting factor in the fully hadronic

Four different scenarios are considered for the systematic uncertainties.

\(b\bar{b}\tau^{+}\tau^{-}\) sub-channel. However, thanks to upgrades of several trigger systems, the expected performance of \(\tau_{\text{had-vis}}\) triggers at the HL-LHC [30] should allow the analysis to maintain offline \(p_{\text{T}}\) thresholds of 40 (30)  on the leading (sub-leading) \(\tau_{\text{had-vis}}\), with the additional advantage of no longer needing to require the presence of an additional jet at Level 1.

The impact of increasing the leading and sub-leading \(\tau_{\text{had-vis}}\)\(p_{\text{T}}\) thresholds has been studied by repeating the analysis for several variations of the minimum \(\tau_{\text{had-vis}}\)\(p_{\text{T}}\) requirements, as illustrated in Figure 15. The requirement that DTT events contain an additional jet with offline \(p_{\text{T}}>80\) (as described in Section 3.1 and Ref. [24]) has to be maintained as otherwise the extrapolation of the estimated background would not be valid. The expected 95% CL upper limit on the SM Higgs-boson-pair production cross-section was extrapolated to 14  and 3000, for each of the considered trigger scenarios, using the procedure previously described, without considering the impact of systematic uncertainties, as shown on the left plot of Figure 15. The sensitivity to the Higgs boson self-coupling is affected more by raising the \(p_{\text{T}}\) thresholds, compared to the overall SM Higgs-boson-pair production process. For this reason the study is repeated with a BDT classifier trained to be sensitive to the Higgs boson self-coupling production mode, as was used to perform the \(\kappa_{\lambda}\) scan. The results are shown on the right plot of Figure 15.

In a pessimistic scenario where the leading and sub-leading minimum \(\tau_{\text{had-vis}}\)\(p_{\text{T}}\) thresholds are required to be 70 and 60 respectively (and the additional jet requirement is maintained), the upper limit on the \(HH\) cross-section degrades by about 30% compared to the result obtained with the Run 2 thresholds. In the case where the BDT is trained on the \(\kappa_{\lambda}=20\) sample, this effect is even more pronounced and the limit degrades by about 60% compared to the Run 2 thresholds. It is important to note that the requirement of an additional jet with \(p_{\text{T}}>80\)  to a large extent masks the effect of raising the leading \(\tau_{\text{had-vis}}\)\(p_{\text{T}}\), and the degradation is expected to be even larger when comparing triggers that do not include the additional jet requirement.

## 4 \(Hh\to b\bar{b}\gamma\gamma\)

One of the most promising channels to measure the Higgs boson self-coupling is the \(b\bar{b}\gamma\gamma\) final state. It arises from the most probable Higgs boson decay, \(H\to b\bar{b}\), in association with the \(H\to\gamma\gamma\) decay, which provides a narrow mass peak and a very clean Higgs boson signal.

The current upper limits on the non-resonant Higgs-boson-pair production cross-section rely on data collected by the ATLAS and CMS experiments at a 13 TeV centre-of-mass energy with an integrated luminosity of 36.1 fb\({}^{-1}\). The ATLAS Collaboration reported an observed (expected) limit on the cross-section for non-resonant \(HH\) production of 0.73 pb (0.93 pb) at 95% CL, corresponding to 22 (28) times the SM prediction, and constrained the Higgs boson self-coupling to \(-8.2<\kappa_{\lambda}<13.2\) (\(-8.3<\kappa_{\lambda}<13.2\)) at 95% CL [53]. The CMS Collaboration reported an observed (expected) limit on the cross-section for non-resonant \(HH\) production of 0.79 pb (0.63 pb) at 95% CL, corresponding to 24 (19) times the SM prediction, and constrained the Higgs boson self-coupling to \(-11<\kappa_{\lambda}<17\) at 95% CL [54].

Unlike the \(HH\to b\bar{b}b\bar{b}\) and \(HH\to b\bar{b}\tau^{+}\tau^{-}\) analyses, which are based on extrapolating the Run 2 results to the HL-LHC, the \(HH\to b\bar{b}\gamma\gamma\) analysis is fully based on simulations at \(\sqrt{s}=14\) TeV. To emulate the upgraded ATLAS detector response, the final-state particles at truth level are smeared according to the expected detector resolutions assuming a pile-up scenario with 200 overlapping events (<\(\mu\)\(\gamma\) = 200) [55]. The expected identification efficiencies and fake rates for \(b\)-jets and photons are used accordingly. These smearing functions were obtained from fully simulated events using the detector layout described in the Pixel Detector TDR [25].

A previous study presented in the Pixel Detector TDR [25] resulted in an expected constraint on the Higgs boson self-coupling in the interval \(0.2<\kappa_{\lambda}<6.9\) at 95% CL, with an expected signal significance of \(1.5\sigma\). This study improves the sensitivity by including a BDT method. This multivariate analysis exploits the full kinematic information to separate the \(HH\) signal from the expected backgrounds. After selecting two isolated photons and two energetic \(b\)-tagged jets, and applying a BDT selection, the signal is extracted using a fit to the di-photon invariant mass distribution of the selected events. The variables used to train the BDT are carefully chosen to ensure that the \(m_{\gamma\gamma}\) distribution is not sculpted. The signal appears as a narrow peak around \(m_{H}\) superimposed on a resonant peak arising from single-Higgs-boson events and a smoothly falling continuum background. Unlike the Run-2 analysis the signal is extracted by selecting events in a narrow window of the \(m_{\gamma\gamma}\) distribution around the Higgs boson mass, and then fitting the \(m_{b\bar{b}\gamma\gamma}\) distribution divided in 8 bins.

### Background and Signal Simulation

The expected signal and background processes are modelled using MC samples. This study reuses most of the samples of the analysis described in Ref. [56], which contains full details about their generation. The main backgrounds arise from various processes involving multiple jets and isolated photons that lead to two photons and two \(b\)-jets in the final state. The largest component of the background is the continuum coming from processes with multiple jet and photon production, such as \(b\bar{b}\gamma\gamma\), \(c\bar{c}\gamma\gamma\), \(jj\gamma\gamma\), \(b\bar{b}j\gamma\), \(c\bar{c}j\gamma\), and \(b\bar{b}jj\) events. It should be noted that the last three of these processes require at least one photon to be a misidentified jet. Other contributions come from \(Z(b\bar{b})\gamma\gamma\), \(t\bar{t}\) and \(t\bar{t}\gamma\) production. A second component of the background comes from processes involving the production and subsequent decay of a single Higgs boson, such as \(gg\to H(\to\gamma\gamma)\), \(ZH(\to\gamma\gamma)\), \(t\bar{t}H(\to\gamma\gamma)\), and \(b\bar{b}H(\to\gamma\gamma)\). These processes are produced with MadGraph5_aMC@NLO [46, 57, 58] interfaced with Pythia[59]for the showering and hadronisation. These samples were generated inclusively (e.g. an additional jet in the tree-level matrix element is allowed). The list of signal and background samples considered is displayed in Table 8. As described below, in this analysis every possible combination of reconstructed candidates arising from a given truth-level event are considered, taking into account the probability of each combination. This procedure enhances the statistical power of the samples, thus compensating for the low equivalent integrated luminosity of some of the samples.

For the signal process \(HH\to b\bar{b}\gamma\gamma\), only the dominant gluon-gluon fusion production mode is generated using Madgraph5_aMC@NLO at LO (with a finite top-quark mass) with Pythia 8 to model parton showering and hadronisation. The A14 tune [60] is used together with the NNPDF2.3LO PDF set [61]. The event yields are normalised to the next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) cross-sections of Refs. [62] and [63] (using the infinite top-quark mass approximation). Events were produced with self-coupling strengths \(\kappa_{\lambda}=0,\pm 1,\pm 2,\pm 4,\pm 6,\pm 10\), with \(\kappa_{\lambda}=1\) corresponding to the SM expectation.

Overlaps between the different samples are taken into account at analysis level, for example \(b\bar{b}\gamma\gamma\) events are excluded from the \(b\bar{b}j\gamma\) samples and \(t\bar{t}\gamma\) events from the \(t\bar{t}\) sample.

### Object Definitions

The event sample reconstruction uses the same approach as in Ref. [56]. The final-state particles at truth level are smeared according to the expected detector resolutions, and the impact of an average of 200 pile-up events is included in the reconstruction efficiency and energy smearing of the objects. Any truth jets that are matched to truth \(e/\gamma\) objects are removed at this point.

The photon energy is smeared using the baseline photon resolution parameterisation described in Ref. [32], which is based on fully reconstructed simulation and provides a di-photon mass resolution comparable to the one obtained in Run 2. In this analysis, the efficiency to identify isolated photons is around 60% at \(p_{\mathrm{T}}=50\) GeV and saturates at 85% above 150 GeV. The corresponding probability for a jet emerging from the primary interaction to be misidentified as a photon is at most \(5\times 10^{-4}\), which is also derived from fully reconstructed simulation. The probability that an electron fakes a photon is assumed to be 2% (5%) in the barrel (endcap) region.

The \(b\)-tagging efficiency and mistag rates have been updated according to the most recent ITk layout which is documented in Ref. [25]. The \(b\)-tagging working point of 70% identification efficiency was chosen. The \(b\)-tagging performance for the reconstructed jets is modelled by applying a \(p_{\mathrm{T}^{-}}\) and \(\eta\)-dependent efficiency or mistag rate function, as a function of the true jet flavour (\(b\)/\(c\)/light, where "light" refers to \(u\)/\(d\)/\(s\)/\(g\)). Such a parameterisation is derived by computing the responses of the ATLAS MV2 \(b\)-tagging algorithm [42], and the track confirmation algorithm, using fully simulated events.

### Event Pre-Selection

The analysis in Ref. [56] typically processed events by first taking each truth-level particle and then examining all the possible object types that the detector might reconstruct it as. Each of these candidate reconstructed particles was assigned a probability based on the efficiency or fake rate, as appropriate, and then one was randomly chosen. In this way, each truth-level particle produced only one reconstructed object and each truth-level event produced a single reconstructed event. For this analysis, the statistical power is enhanced by considering all the possible object types that the truth-level particle could be reconstructed

as, and examining every possible combination of reconstructed candidates arising from the set of truth-level particles. Each truth-level event produces multiple reconstructed events, where the weight of each combination of final-state particles is determined by multiplying together all the selection probabilities of the individual reconstructed objects. In order to reduce the number of final-state combinations to a manageable level, truth-level pile-up jets are only allowed to produce one reconstructed candidate. The pile-up jet may become a light jet, \(b\)-jet, fake photon, fake electron, or not be reconstructed at all - the choice is made randomly, based on the relative probabilities of each of the five possible reconstructed states. It should also be noted that, by construction, the sum of weights of all final-state combinations derived from a single truth-level event is unity.

The number of final-state combinations is further reduced by discarding any combination whose weight falls below a minimum threshold. This threshold is manually selected for each signal and background sample, in an effort to balance file sizes against statistical power. Typically, it has been possible to reduce the number of combinations by up to 80% with \(<0.1\%\) reduction in the integral of final-state weights.

Each final-state combination passing the minimum event weight threshold is first required to contain at least two photons, two \(b\)-jets, and less than ten jets in total. This loose initial selection criterion serves to reduce the processing time by identifying combinations that would fail later cuts, and removing them before the computationally expensive overlap removal procedure is performed. This selection criterion is not expected to have an impact on the number of combinations passing the event selection requirements. The event selection criteria are described in the following and summarised in Table 9.

Final-state combinations must be accepted by a di-photon trigger that requires at least two photons to have \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>25\GeV\) within \(|\eta|<2.37\), excluding the crack region at \(1.37<|\eta|<1.52\) where the photon energy resolution is poor. Offline, there must be at least two photons with \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>30\GeV\) and located within the acceptance of the electromagnetic calorimeter. The leading photon must have \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>43\GeV\).

The following selection criteria are applied to leptons to facilitate overlap removal. Electrons are retained if they have \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>30\GeV\) within \(|\eta|<2.37\) (excluding the crack region) and muons are retained if they have \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>25\GeV\) and \(0.1<|\eta|<2.5\) (driven by the acceptance of muon spectrometer and inner detector tracking). Muons separated from jets by \(\Delta R_{\mu,jet}<0.2\) are assumed to have originated from the jet, and combined with it. To ensure that particles are isolated, leptons separated from jets by \(\Delta R_{\ell,jet}<0.4\) are removed. Electrons separated from muons by \(\Delta R_{e,\mu}<0.2\) are also removed. To ensure that photons are isolated, photons within a cone \(\Delta R_{\gamma,jet}<0.2\) of a jet are removed.

Final-state combinations are required to have at most five jets with \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>30\GeV\) located within \(|\eta|<2.5\). Of these five jets, at least two must be identified as \(b\)-jets with \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>35\GeV\). Finally, it is required that the final-state combination has no remaining isolated leptons.

A pair of Higgs boson candidates is then reconstructed by combining the two leading \(b\)-jets and the two leading photons. The Run 2 analysis [53] corresponds roughly to the pre-selection criteria adopted here, with some small exceptions such as the requirements on isolated leptons and the maximum number of jets.

### Event Selection with a Boosted Decision Tree

The TMVA package [64] is used to perform a multivariate analysis with a BDT. The variables used for training the BDT are summarised in Table 10. It should be noted that most of the improvement with respect to the previous cut-based analysis [25] comes from the use of a BDT for event selection, not from the inclusion of additional kinematic variables.

The signal and background samples are split into two equal subsets with events selected at random - one subset is used to train the BDT, the other subset is used to evaluate the performance of the BDT following its creation. TMVA then evaluates the signal and background efficiencies as a function of the BDT response cut. The significance at each possible cut value is evaluated using the standard Asimov approximation [44], which provides the median significance \(z_{0}\) in the hypothesis of \(s\) signal and \(b\) background events:

The BDT response value that maximises the statistical-only significance is found to be 0.54, and is used in the following. The BDT response for the signal and background test samples is shown in Figure 16.

The response of this BDT is evaluated for every final-state combination in the full background samples, ignoring the earlier requirement of a minimum event weight. The distribution of \(m_{\gamma\gamma}\) for signal and background events passing the BDT response cut is shown in Figure 17. The distribution of \(m_{HH}\) for signal and background events passing the BDT response cut and a \(123~{}\text{GeV}<m_{\gamma\gamma}<127~{}\text{GeV}\) mass cut is shown in Figure 18.

The number of events passing both the BDT response cut and the \(123~{}\text{GeV}<m_{\gamma\gamma}<127~{}\text{GeV}\) mass cut are shown in Table 11. These two selections provide 6.46 signal events and a total of 6.8 background events. The relative MC statistical uncertainty on the selection efficiency of the pre-selection, the BDT response cut and the \(123~{}\text{GeV}<m_{\gamma\gamma}<127~{}\text{GeV}\) mass cut is 1.2% for the sum of all single-Higgs-boson background processes and 1.9% for the sum of all continuum background processes.

Figure 19 shows the signal acceptance times selection efficiency as a function of \(\kappa_{\lambda}\) for events passing the pre-selection criteria and the BDT response cut. The shape of this distribution is dominated by the acceptance, which is in turn affected by the interference between the box and triangle diagrams in the \(HH\) production. Events are most boosted at \(\kappa_{\lambda}\approx 2\) where the interference is greatest and the Higgs-boson-pair production cross-section is minimal.

### Systematic Uncertainties

The systematic uncertainties considered here follow the recommendations for HL-LHC studies [26]. Experimental uncertainties are taken from Run 2 results [53] with scaling factors corresponding to the expected improvements. In the Run 2 analysis theory uncertainties are taken from Ref. [20], except for the

QCD scale uncertainty assigned to the ggF production mode where a conservative uncertainty of 100% is considered, motivated by studies of heavy-flavour production in association with top-quark pairs and \(W\) boson production in association with \(b\)-jets [53]. Those theory uncertainties are halved, following the prescriptions of Ref.[26]. The systematic uncertainties are summarised in Table 12.

For the purpose of this prospect study, a cut-and-count analysis is performed on events within the

The reducible background processes consist of \(c\bar{c}\gamma\gamma\), \(jj\gamma\gamma\), \(b\bar{b}j\gamma\), \(c\bar{c}j\gamma\), and \(b\bar{b}jj\) events. Other background processes come from \(Z(b\bar{b})\gamma\gamma\), \(t\bar{t}\) and \(t\bar{t}\gamma\).

Other background processes come from \(Z(b\bar{b})\gamma\gamma\), \(t\bar{t}\) and \(t\bar{t}\gamma\).

\(123\GeV<m_{\gamma\gamma}<127\GeV\) mass region, and fitting the \(m_{b\bar{b}\gamma\gamma}\) shape. However, with data the continuum background would be extracted from a fit to the \(m_{\gamma\gamma}\) distribution. It is expected that the uncertainty introduced by such a fit will be sub-leading compared to the current statistical uncertainty, and therefore it is not considered here. For this reason no theory or experimental uncertainty has been considered on the expected yield for the continuum background passing the analysis and BDT selection, nor on the \(m_{b\bar{b}\gamma\gamma}\) shape used later to compute the significance and constrain the value of \(\kappa_{\lambda}\).

### Results

The expected significance in this channel has been evaluated to be 2.0 (2.1) standard deviations with (without) systematic uncertainties. The degradation of the non-\(b\)-jet fake rates to its Run 2 performance (corresponding to the increase of the light- and \(c\)-jet fake rates by factors of 1.8 and 2.5, respectively) would result in a relative decrease by 5% of this significance. The expected 95% CL upper limit on the relative signal strength \(\sigma_{HH}/\sigma^{SM}_{HH}\) is found to be 1.2 (1.1) with (without) systematic uncertainties.

The sensitivity of the \(b\bar{b}\gamma\gamma\) analysis to \(\kappa_{\lambda}\) is assessed as follows. Events passing the BDT response cut and having \(m_{\gamma\gamma}\) falling in a narrow window of 123 \(\GeV\) to 127 \(\GeV\) are selected, and the resultant distribution of \(m_{HH}\) is split into eight bins over the range \(320\GeV<m_{HH}<900\GeV\). The same morphing technique that was used in the \(HH\to b\bar{b}b\bar{b}\) analysis is applied to generate a signal distribution at any arbitrary value of \(\kappa_{\lambda}\). The distributions of \(m_{HH}\) for various values of \(\kappa_{\lambda}\) are shown in Figure 20. The \(m_{HH}\) distributions were generated in the range \(-20\leq\kappa_{\lambda}\leq 20\).

Subsequently an Asimov dataset with the predicted SM \(HH\) signal was created, and maximum likelihood fits to this dataset were performed for different \(\kappa_{\lambda}\) hypotheses, combining all eight \(m_{HH}\) bins. Figure 21 shows the resulting negative natural logarithm of the ratio of the maximum likelihood for \(\kappa_{\lambda}\) to that for the fit with \(\kappa_{\lambda}=1\) for two scenarios: no systematic uncertainties and with systematic uncertainties. The \(1\sigma\) and \(2\sigma\) CIs are reported in Table 13. The negative natural logarithm of the ratio of the maximum

The combination of various channels is realised by constructing a combined likelihood function that takes into account pseudo-data, signal and background models, and correlated systematic uncertainties from all channels. All the signal regions considered in the simultaneous fit either are orthogonal by construction or have negligible overlap due to different selection criteria.

Setting appropriate nuisance parameters to be correlated with one another induces a negligible change in the combination results compared to assuming all nuisance parameters are uncorrelated. Accordingly, only those nuisance parameters relating to Run 2 detector performance are correlated between the and channels in the following results. There are 120 nuisance parameters included in the statistical analysis. No strong correlations between any of these nuisance parameters are found in the fit, with the exception of some correlation (up to about \(\pm 35\%\)) between background-modelling nuisance parameters in the analysis and between background-modelling nuisance parameters in the analysis. These correlations are also observed in the individual HL-LHC extrapolations. Theoretical uncertainties on the signal cross-section have negligible impact on the combined result.

Projected upper limits on the signal cross-section are set, using Asimov datasets that contain no signal. For the SM signal, the 95% CL upper limit is 20.7 fb () when systematics are not included and 24.9 fb () when they are. For the signal with, i.e. no self-coupling, the limits are 27.8 fb () and 33.1 fb (), respectively.

Table 15 shows the expected median significance of the SM signal relative to the background-only hypothesis for the individual channels and their combination. With 3000 fb of data, a SM signal is expected to yield a significance of 3.0 over the background-only expectation. The discrepancy when

fitting the signal-plus-background model with \(\kappa_{\lambda}=0\) to pseudo-data generated with the SM \(HH\) signal (\(\kappa_{\lambda}=1\)) has a significance of \(1.4\sigma\) (\(1.8\sigma\)) for the case with (without) systematic uncertainties.

Table 16 shows the signal strength measured in the individual channels, as well as the combination, when the SM \(HH\) signal is injected.

The combined sensitivity of the three analyses to \(\kappa_{\lambda}\) is assessed by generating an Asimov dataset containing the backgrounds plus SM \(HH\) signal. The negative natural logarithm of the ratio of the maximum likelihood fit for \(\kappa_{\lambda}\) to that for the fit with \(\kappa_{\lambda}=1\) is shown in Figure 23. From these curves, the confidence intervals for \(\kappa_{\lambda}\) reported in Table 17 are extracted. A second test of the sensitivity of the three analyses to \(\kappa_{\lambda}\) was performed, in this case generating an Asimov dataset containing the backgrounds plus \(\kappa_{\lambda}=0\) signal (i.e. no Higgs boson self-coupling). The negative natural logarithm of the ratio of the maximum likelihood fit for \(\kappa_{\lambda}\) to that for the fit with \(\kappa_{\lambda}=0\) is shown in Figure 24. From these curves, the confidence intervals for \(\kappa_{\lambda}\) are extracted and documented in Table 18.

The significance with which the Higgs boson pair production would be observed is shown as a function of \(\kappa_{\lambda}\) in Figure 25. The significance depends on the expected signal yield and therefore it is lower for those \(\kappa_{\lambda}\) values for which the cross-section and the acceptance times efficiency is low.

## 6 Projections for HE-LHC

The presented HL-LHC studies for the \(b\bar{b}\gamma\gamma\) and \(b\bar{b}\tau^{+}\tau^{-}\) final states were extended to provide first estimates of the prospects at the High Energy LHC (HE-LHC), assuming a centre-of-mass collision energy of 27 and 15 \(\mathrm{ab}^{-1}\) of \(pp\) collision data.

For the \(b\bar{b}\gamma\gamma\) final state, the estimate is based on the results of the HL-LHC study (Section 4). Therefore, the event selection is based on the same BDT selection criteria as used in the HL-LHC analysis, which was optimised for achieving the highest significance for the SM \(HH\) signal rather than the best sensitivity to BSM couplings. Furthermore, it is assumed that the detector performance will be the same as the HL-LHC ATLAS detector. This includes the same impact on the final-state particles from pile-up and on average the same number of jets arising from pile-up.

Comparisons between \(\sqrt{s}=14\) and \(\sqrt{s}=27\) simulations show that the kinematics at particle level of the \(b\)-jets and photons from the Higgs boson decay as well as the \(m_{HH}\) distributions are similar. However, on average the photon and \(b\)-jet pairs from the Higgs boson decay tend to be more boosted and the \(\eta\) spectrum of the decay particles tends to be pointing more frequently in the forward region, which will likely decrease the efficiency times acceptance by around 10%. This effect is not taken into account in the following, but it is not expected to have a significant impact on the results presented.

The event yields of each background sample, reported in Section 4.4, are scaled by the increase in luminosity and the ratio of the MC generator cross-sections at \(\sqrt{s}=27\) and \(\sqrt{s}=14\). Such scaling is necessary since the background cross-section calculations that include the higher order corrections are not yet available for the \(\sqrt{s}=27\) centre-of-mass energy. The signal event yields are extrapolated in a similar way by increasing the luminosity and normalising the event yields to the SM \(HH\) production cross-section of 139.9 fb, which corresponds to the latest LHC Higgs Cross-Section Working Group [19] recommendations. The yields are shown in Table 19.

Using the same method as in the \(\sqrt{s}=14\) analysis, the sensitivity of observing the SM \(HH\) production and to various values of the Higgs boson self-coupling, \(\kappa_{\lambda}\), is calculated. The sensitivity is extracted from the \(m_{HH}\) distribution, which is constructed from the two leading \(b\)-jets and the two leading photons found in the event. The signal significance with respect to the background-only hypothesis is found to be 7.1\(\sigma\) in the asymptotic approximation, assuming only statistical uncertainties. The systematic uncertainties are unknown for the HE-LHC. However, to get an idea of its impact, the significance would drop to 5.4\(\sigma\) in case the same systematic uncertainties as for the HL-LHC were assumed. These uncertainties predominantly arise from the uncertainties in the photon energy scale. If these uncertainties were reduced by a factor of two a 5.9\(\sigma\) significance would be achieved. Thus, \(HH\to b\bar{b}\gamma\gamma\) production can be observed at the HE-LHC. The negative natural logarithm of the ratio of the maximum likelihood for \(\kappa_{\lambda}\) to that for the fit with \(\kappa_{\lambda}=1\) is displayed in Figure 26. The value of \(\kappa_{\lambda}\) is expected to be measured as \(1\pm 0.4\) if only statistical uncertainties are considered. Assuming the same systematic uncertainties (or photon energy resolution uncertainties reduced by a factor of two) as at the HL-LHC, the precision in measuring \(\kappa_{\lambda}\) is around 0.50 (0.45). Although it is not possible to make a reliable prediction of the expected level of systematic uncertainties at HE-LHC, the high signal over background ratio close to 1 expected in the \(HH\to b\bar{b}\gamma\gamma\) analysis will ensure a limited impact of background systematics on the signal significance. When only statistical uncertainties are considered, the \(\kappa_{\lambda}=0\) hypothesis can be rejected with a confidence level of 2.3\(\sigma\).

Similarly, the expected HE-LHC sensitivity to a SM \(HH\) signal in the \(b\bar{b}\tau^{+}\tau^{-}\) final state is estimated by extrapolating the current Run 2 result [24] using the same statistical framework, based on the profile

The dashed lines at \(-\ln(L_{\kappa_{\lambda}}/L_{\kappa_{\lambda}=1})=0.5\) and 2.0 indicate the values corresponding to a \(1\sigma\) and \(2\sigma\) confidence interval, respectively (assuming an asymptotic \(\chi^{2}\) distribution of the test statistic).

likelihood ratio [44]. Compared to the procedure described in Section 3.2, a more simplified extrapolation procedure is used. The Run 2 BDT distributions for signal and background are scaled to 15 ab\({}^{-1}\) by a single multiplicative factor, defined as the ratio of the target luminosity to the luminosity of the Run 2 result. The performance of the HE-LHC detector is assumed to be broadly similar to that of the current detector, with the exception that the efficiency to identify jets from b-quarks is expected to improve by 8% for a given light-jet rejection due to the upgraded inner tracker (similar to what has been assumed for the HL-LHC).

The increase in centre-of-mass energy from \(\sqrt{s}=13\) TeV to \(\sqrt{s}=27\) TeV is accounted for by scaling the number of expected background events by a factor of 4.5, to account for the approximate cross-section increase arising from the enhanced gluon-luminosity. In the case of the SM \(HH\) signal, the signal yields are scaled to the cross-section of 139.9 fb [19]. In the extrapolation the \(Z\)+heavy-flavour background is scaled by the normalisation factor of 1.34 obtained in the Run 2 analysis, while the \(t\bar{t}\) normalisation is taken from simulation since its Run 2 normalisation factor was consistent with unity.

The HE-LHC expected significance for the SM \(HH\) process in the \(b\bar{b}\tau^{+}\tau^{-}\) final state, based on the extrapolation procedure described above and without taking into account any systematic uncertainties, is \(11\sigma\). In the same scenario, the \(\kappa_{\lambda}=0\) hypothesis can be rejected with a confidence level of \(5.8\sigma\), while the Higgs-self coupling strength is expected to be measured as \(\kappa_{\lambda}=1.0\pm 0.2\).

## 7 Conclusion

A prospect study for the search for non-resonant Higgs-boson-pair production at the HL-LHC has been performed, using the combination of the \(b\bar{b}b\bar{b}\), \(b\bar{b}\gamma\gamma\) and \(b\bar{b}\tau^{+}\tau^{-}\) final states. The signal strength relative to the Standard Model is expected to be measured with an accuracy of 40% (31%) with (without) systematic uncertainties.

The Higgs boson self-coupling is constrained at 95% confidence level to \(-0.4\leq\kappa_{\lambda}\leq 7.3\) (\(-0.1\leq\kappa_{\lambda}\leq 2.7\cup 5.5\leq\kappa_{\lambda}\leq 6.9\)), with (without) systematic uncertainties. The value of \(\kappa_{\lambda}\) is expected to be measured as \(1.0^{+0.9}_{-0.8}\) (\(1.0^{+0.7}_{-0.6}\)) with (without) systematic uncertainties. It may be possible to improve the sensitivity of the combination in the future through enhancements of the \(b\bar{b}\tau^{+}\tau^{-}\) and \(b\bar{b}\gamma\gamma\) analyses, such as explicitly training BDTs for specific values of \(\kappa_{\lambda}\) or attempting to optimise event selection at low \(m_{HH}\).

First estimates of the prospects at the HE-LHC, assuming 15 ab\({}^{-1}\) of data recorded at a centre-of-mass collision energy of 27 TeV, have also been obtained by further extrapolating the measurements in the \(b\bar{b}\gamma\gamma\) and \(b\bar{b}\tau^{+}\tau^{-}\) final states. For the \(b\bar{b}\gamma\gamma\) final state, it is expected that the signal will be measured at a statistical-only significance of \(7.1\sigma\) and \(\kappa_{\lambda}\) will be measured as \(1.0\pm 0.4\). For the \(b\bar{b}\tau^{+}\tau^{-}\) final state, it is expected that the signal will be measured at a statistical-only significance of \(11\sigma\) and \(\kappa_{\lambda}\) will be measured as \(1.0\pm 0.2\).
