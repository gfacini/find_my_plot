###### Abstract

This document is a first approach to determine to what extend the TILECAL system is able to cope with the various available (fall 2004) LHC upgrade scenarios. The impacts of these scenarios on the detector, the readout electronics and the TILECAL performances are reviewed leading to a general table summarizing the capabilities or limitations of the presently designed TILECAL.

## 1 Introduction

Six LHC machine upgrade scenarios have been selected by the ATLAS High-Lumi steering group. Important parameters for these scenarios are summarized in table 1. More details can be found in [1]. Main Tilecal limitations to operate within the six selected SLHC scenarios come from:

* the increase of radiation levels
* increase of pile-up
* possible LHC operation with bunch spacing less than 25ms (not in these scenarios), or with very long bunches.
* occupancy, possible increase of event size
* activation

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{l c c c c} Scenario & Luminosity Bunch spacing & Bunch length & Interactions/ \\  & (10\({}^{34}\)) & (ns) & (cm) & bunch crossing \\ Nominal & 1.0 & 25 & 7.55 & 23 \\ Ultimate & 2.3 & 25 & 7.55 & 53 \\ Piwinski-2 & 3.2 & 75 & 40.00 & 221 \\ Piwinski-1 & 3.6 & 25 & 15.20 & 83 \\ IR-Upgrade & 4.6 & 25 & 3.78 & 106 \\ Piwinski-IR upgrade & 6.3 & 75 & 20.00 & 435 \\ Superbunch & 9.0 & \(\approx\) 88000 & 7500.00 & \(\approx\) 900 000 \\ \end{tabular}

in 1995 to be less than 1% per year [5]. New studies started / are foreseen in a near future.

Light Yield degradation in function of time can affect the detector performance on jet energy measurement and resolution.

20 pe/GeV are enough to achieve the required TILECAL energy resolution [6]. Then, to be able to detect the muon signal in each sampling, 40 pe/GeV are required. TILECAL set a minimum requirement of \(\sim 50\) pe/GeV, adding a safety margin of 20% for light loss during LHC operation. The mean light yield for TILECAL modules tested in 2002,2003 and 2004 is about 65 pe/GeV, taking into account natural tile ageing prior to 2002.

Some nice features of the Tile calorimeter help to reduce the impact on the detector performances. Tiles can be calibrated using the cesium system, and the HV of the PMTs can be tuned to uniformize to first order the light loss in the optics. PMTs are at a working point 20% below the nominal design gain value. Their voltage can be tuned over a range of at least 100 Volts, the gain varying as 1% per volt. So the voltage system is able to handle calibration variations of at least a factor 2. We can therefore conclude that the anticipated decrease of jet energy measurement due to the light yield degradation could be fully recovered.

Nevertheless the light loss will be different from tile to tile connected to the same PMT, Radiation effects decreasing in function of the radial depth. The applied average Cs calibration factors will recover only partially the spread of the light loss.

In addition, the energy resolution depends on the photostatistic contribution. For light output losses of 10,20 and 50%, the relative degradation of the resolution is found to be resp. about 0.6, 1.4 and 5.4%.

In summary:

* The light loss budget could be evaluated as 65-40= 25 pe/GeV, allowing an overal decrease of the light yield of about 40% during LHC operation.
* The maximum anticipated light loss is about 18% for 5 years of running at a luminosity of 9 10\({}^{34}\).

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{l c c c c} \hline Scenario & Luminosity & \multicolumn{3}{c}{Light loss (\%/5Yr)} \\  & (10\({}^{34}\)) & sampling & 1 sampling & 2 sampling \\ \hline Nominal & 1.0 & 0.3 - 3 & \(<\) 0.8 & \(<\) 0.2 \\ Ultimate & 2.3 & 0.7 - 7 & \(<\) 1.8 & \(<\) 0.4 \\ Piwinski-2 & 3.2 & 0.9 - 9 & \(<\) 2.4 & \(<\) 0.6 \\ Piwinski-1 & 3.6 & 1.0 - 10 & \(<\) 2.7 & \(<\) 0.6 \\ IR-Upgrade & 4.6 & 1.3 - 12 & \(<\) 3.4 & \(<\) 0.8 \\ Piwinski-IR upgrade & 6.3 & 1.8 - 15 & \(<\) 4.5 & \(<\) 1.1 \\ Superbunch & 9.0 & 2.5 - 18 & \(<\) 6.2 & \(<\) 1.6 \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 3: Light loss due to radiation doses for 5 years of running in each scenario * The anticipated light losses induced by radiation doses and ageing will have no effect on the measurement of the jet energy, and a marginal effect on the jet energy resolution.

**We could conclude that radiation and natural ageing effects will not affect the TILECAL performances in any of the proposed scenarios for a global LHC operation over 12 years (for example 2 years at low lumi, followed by 5 years at nominal, and then 5 years at \(10^{35}\)).**

## 3 TILECAL electronics capabilities

### Radiation effects on electronic components

Radiations affect also the electronics located insider the girder as well as the power supply located in the fingers. Numerous aspects have been studied (TID,NIEL, SEE..)1 on cmos and bipolar components[7]. All active components have been tested above expected doses (with appropriate safety factors 2) after 10 years at nominal lumi; the worst location with respect to radiation level being kept as baseline. [7][8].

Footnote 1: TID : Total ionizing Dose

NIEL : Non Ionizing Energy Loss

SEE : Single Even Effects

Footnote 2: Applied safety factors for TID/NIEL/SEE :

a factor 3.5/5/5 for simulation uncertainty

a factor 4/4/4 for inhomogeneous batches

a factor 5/1/1 for bipolar components

## Niel

NIEL doses for all Luminosity scenarios could be scaled from the nominal scenario values. Table 5 gives the expected NIEL safety factors on the TILECAL electronic components after 5 years of running in a given scenario. These factors can be compared with required safety factors.light-grey boxes point out components for which the required safety factor is not reached but still acceptable. Grey boxes stand for components tested largely below requirable doses. This table indicate that all components, except the interface and the low voltage power supply system (LVPS+ELMB) which are a little bit below the required safety factor, have been sufficiently tested for NIEL rates expected for an Ultimate scenario operating at a luminosity of \(2.3\,10^{34}\) during 5 years. To conclude positively up to an IR-Upgrade scenario operating at \(4.6\,10^{34}\) during 5 years, further NIEL qualification tests are

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:6]

These effects induced by SEU are recovered by a power cycle of the electronic component (of the affected drawer), which is expected to be done once per day for the whole TILECAL.

If we scale SEE rate with luminosity and assume a ROD upgrade, we could anticipate about 5 SEU per week for a superbunch scenario running for 5 years, always recoverable by power cycling. Since no Destructive SEU have been seen during tests, it is difficult to anticipate any rate at higher SEE rate, except if new tests are made at higher rates. Experience gained during the first years of LHC running will allow a better knowledge of the SEE (factor 5 on the SEE safety factor due to simulation) and SEU rates.

We can conclude, for what concern the SEE, that TILECAL could cope with all scenarios with only very few events for physics affected in 1 over 256 TILECAL sectors. However, new SEE tests should be made to qualify the electronics for higher SEE rates.

## conclusion on radiation effects.

Considering that SEE rate will induce only marginal failures on TILECAL electronics, and in order to asses the TILECAL electronic capabilities at SLHC from the radiation point of view, we computed the estimator:

\[R_{i}=min(\frac{SFD_{i}^{k}}{SFR^{k}});\]

SFD being the safety factor deduced from qualification tests on TID and NIEL for component k and scenario i, and SFR the required safety factor for a component k as fixed in [7]. The estimator R has been computed assuming 5 years of running at scenario i. Values are summarized in table 6. 7/20 for the IR-Upgrade scenario indicate that the safety factor reached from various radiation tests is 7 at minimum, while the required safety factor is 20.

**This table demonstrate that TILECAL electronics have been sufficiently tested for doses expected for an Ultimate scenario operating at a luminosity of 2.3 \(10^{34}\) during 5 years. TILECAL electronics maybe can operate safely in other higher luminosity scenarios (still a factor 3 of safety factor for a SuperBunch scenario), but additional radiation tests are needed to reach the required factors, particularly on the mother board and interface cards.**

**Finally, experience gained during the first years of LHC running will allow a better knowledge of the radiations doses, and hopefully a reduction of the required safety factors(factor 3.5 applied for simulation uncertainty on TID and 5 for NIEL rates).**

**It should be noticed that prior to any upgrade, ATLAS will run a certain time at luminosities between \(10^{33}\) and \(10^{34}\). Doses integrated over this first period of LHC running will have to be counted also.**

### Running the TILECAL electronics at SLHC

Even if not retained in the six selected scenarios, one way to increase the luminosity at SLHC is to change the beam crossing rate, one possible option being an operation with a bunch spacing of 15 ns between two interactions.

Tests are needed to determine if the TILECAL electronics is able to cope with a SLHC operation with bunch spacing less than 25ns, for example a bunch spacing of 15 ns with a front-end electronic frequency at 30ns. In this case, TILECAL will not be able to sample every event on the peak of the pulse. A new treatment of the signal at the level of the optimal filtering in the ROD has to be implemented. In addition it has to be proved that front-end electronics works fine at a 30ns frequency. One difficulty could come at the level of the interface where the Glink output for data is set to a fixed 25ns clock (no use of QPLL chip). It is not obvious to resynchronize to 30ns with the current interface design. Other difficulties like the ability to span the Deskew2 clock over the full clock period have to be investigated. In the worse case interface cards would have to be redone, which would require R&D, the production of 270 cards, and 4 months of operations for the replacement of the cards on the detector. It could be noticed that more radical changes of the TILECAL electronic hardware, like 3in1 cards will require about 2 years for a full de-installation, upgrade and re-installation of the drawers once the new electronic components are produced.

## 4 Others impacts on TILECAL performances

Some aspects of the energy measurement and resolution, in connection with the light yield evolution in function of the radiations doses, have already been discussed in 2.1.

### pile-up effects

Pile-up background is by far more critical for the accuracy on the jet energy measurements at SLHC than the light yield loss due to radiations. Nothing on the detector can be done to fight against the pile-up. Some algorithms can be foreseen

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{l c c} \hline Scenario & Luminosity & R \\  & (\(10^{34}\)) & \\ \hline Nominal & 1.0 & 30/20 \\ Ultimate & 2.3 & 13/20 \\ Piwinski-2 & 3.2 & 9/20 \\ Piwinski-1 & 3.6 & 8/20 \\ IR-Upgrade & 4.6 & 7/20 \\ Piwinski-IR upgrade & 6.3 & 5/20 \\ Superbunch & 9.0 & 3/20 \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 6: Estimator value R (for 5 years running)The jet energy resolution can be parametrized by the expression :

\[\frac{\sigma(E)}{E}=\frac{a}{\sqrt{E}}\oplus b\oplus\frac{c}{E} \tag{1}\]

where a account for the contribution from the statistical fluctuations (sampling term), b term is due to non-uniformity, miscalibration or non-compensation effects, and the constant term c takes into account noise effects (pile-up and electronic noise). The sampling term and the noise term are correlated. To estimate the evolution of the energy resolution for other scenarios, we suppose in the following that only the noise term is different due to the increase of pile-up events.

The spread of the deposited energy by MB events scales as the square root of the number of interaction per BX. Therefore the pile-up contribution for each scenario can be scaled from the contribution evaluated for the Nominal scenario with a scale factor (SF):

\[SF=\sqrt{N_{int}^{i}/23}\]

where \(N_{int}^{i}\) is the number of interactions/BX for scenario i. Finally, the jet energy resolution for each scenario can be predicted using the expression (1) with c term expressed in function of the SF factor, the electronic noise (\(c_{1}\)) and pile-noise(\(c_{2}\)) contributions:

\[c=\sqrt{c_{1}^{2}+(c_{2}*SF)^{2}} \tag{2}\]

The calculation require, in addition to a and b terms, the knowledge of the eletronic and pile-up contributions, both for TILECAL and LARG detectors.

Figure 1: Jet energy resolution at various energies in function of the noise term value. (\(\Delta R\) = 0.4,\(\eta\) \(\approx\) 0)

Simulation data at Nominal luminosity with and without pile-up and electronic noise included have been fitted [9] with the expression (1). For a cone \(\Delta R=0.4\) at \(\eta\approx 0\), \(a=62,4\%GeV^{1/2}\) and \(b=1.7\%\) reproduce well the data with (c=4.7 GeV) and without noise(c=0 GeV).

The total electronic noise for a cone \(\Delta R=0.4\), no digital filtering applied is about 3 GeV (Hadronic scale)[9]. Under the same conditions, the pile-up contribution is found to be 4 GeV [9] or 9.6 GeV [10][11]. The main contribution to the pile-up comes from LARG detector (8.8 (1.9) for the Larg (TILECAL) [10][11]).

### Energy resolution

The jet energy resolution at various energies in function of the noise term value is deduced using the expressions 1 and 2.

As expected, the pile-up increase affect more low energetic jets, and have a little impact on high energetic jets (see figure 1). Taking as baseline the worse case (3.0 GeV for the electronic noise and 9.6 GeV for the pile-up contributions), an energy resolution curve has been established for all scenarios (figure 2), except for the Superbunch scenario where jets energy are not measurables.

Typicaly, for 100 Gev jets at \(\eta\approx 0\), the energy resolution is about 12% for the Nominal scenario, and increase up to 40% for the Piwinski-IR upgrade scenario (435 MB interactions/bunch crossing). It should be noticed that physics effects like extra energy in cone from Underlying Events is not taken into account here.

## 5 Conclusion

All these investigations lead to the following table (table 7) summarizing the capabilities or limitations of the presently designed TILECAL detector for each scenarios.

Further tests are needed to qualify the TILECAL electronics for radiations levels expected in case of a SLHC operating during 5 years at a luminosity above 2.3 10\({}^{34}\). Nevertheless, the TILECAL detector performances in term of energy measurement and resolution remain essentially identical for the various envisaged upgrade scenarios. The jet resolution will finally depends on the pile-up contribution size and handling at the level of the reconstruction ( jet defined in a smaller \(\Delta\) R cone, \(E_{T}\) cuts on cells...).
