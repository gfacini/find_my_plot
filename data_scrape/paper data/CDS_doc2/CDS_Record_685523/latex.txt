###### Abstract

The production of a light Standard Model Higgs boson in association with a top quark-pair at the lhc is studied with the fast simulation of the atlas detector. The Higgs boson is assumed to decay into \(\mathrm{b\bar{b}}\), one top-quark to decay into \(\ell\nu\)b and the other top-quark into jjb, leading to a complex final state of 1 isolated lepton, missing transverse momentum, and 6 jets of which 4 jets are b-jets. The full reconstruction of the final state is necessary to minimize the combinatorial background from assigning two out of the four b-jets to the Higgs boson decay and to discriminate the signal process from the large background from top quark-pairs with additional jets. Two methods for the analysis of this channel are presented: A 'classical' reconstruction which is based on the procedure developed in the context of the atlas detector and physics performance tdr, and an improved method which makes use of likelihood techniques.

Introduction

The search for the Higgs boson will be one of the major tasks of the experiments at the Large Hadron Collider (lhc). The Standard Model cross sections in next-to-leading-order calculation for various Higgs boson production processes at the lhc are depicted in Figure 2 (except for \(\mathrm{gg},\mathrm{q}\bar{\mathrm{q}}\to\mathrm{Ht}\bar{\mathrm{t}},\mathrm{H} \mathrm{b}\bar{\mathrm{b}}\) which are leading-order results), and the Higgs boson branching ratios are shown in Figure 2. In the low Higgs boson mass range (up to \(m_{\mathrm{H}}\lesssim\)135 GeV) the decay mode with the highest branching fraction is H\(\rightarrow\)\(\mathrm{b}\bar{\mathrm{b}}\). It will not be possible to observe this decay channel in the dominant direct production gg\(\rightarrow\)H due to the huge qcd backgrounds. However, the \(\mathrm{b}\bar{\mathrm{b}}\) final state can be observed in the associated production of a Higgs boson with a W or Z boson or a pair of top quarks [1]. Other important search channels for the low Higgs boson mass range (110-150 GeV) are the direct production with subsequent photonic decays, gg\(\rightarrow\)H\(\rightarrow\gamma\gamma\), the four lepton channel H\(\rightarrow\)ZZ\({}^{*}\)\(\rightarrow\)\(\mathrm{d}\ell\) in the direct production, H\(\rightarrow\)\(\gamma\gamma\) from the associated production WH, ZH and ttH [1], and the channels where the Higgs boson is produced in the fusion of weak gauge bosons [2]. The ttH production with \(\mathrm{t}\bar{\mathrm{t}}\rightarrow\ell\nu\mathrm{b}\,\mathrm{j}\mathrm{j} \mathrm{b}\) and H\(\rightarrow\)\(\mathrm{b}\bar{\mathrm{b}}\) is subject of this note.

The \(\mathrm{t}\bar{\mathrm{t}}\mathrm{H}\), \(\mathrm{H}\rightarrow\mathrm{b}\bar{\mathrm{b}}\) channel was already studied thoroughly for the tdr[1, 5]. It was shown that the signal from the Higgs boson can be observed as a peak in the \(m_{\mathrm{b}\mathrm{b}}\) mass spectrum if the combinatorial background is minimized by a full reconstruction of the final state. The combinatorial background arises from choosing two out of the four b-jets present in the signal. A significance of \(S/\sqrt{B}=5.0\) for \(m_{\mathrm{H}}=100\) GeV and \(S/\sqrt{B}=3.6\) for \(m_{\mathrm{H}}=120\) GeV was predicted for an integrated luminosity of 30 fb\({}^{-1}\), and with an efficiency of 60 % for finding b-jets and rejection factors against c- and light jets of \(\mathrm{R_{c}}=\)10 and \(\mathrm{R_{j}}=\)100. The tdr concludes that this channel alone would account for half of the Higgs boson discovery potential of atlas in the low mass range (meanwhile the analysis of the weak boson fusion processes has shown that these channels have a significant contribution as well [2]).

The earlier analysis made use of the parton shower approach implemented in the pythia Monte Carlo generator [6] to simulate the dominant background processes from top quark-pairs with additional b-jets. It was noted that a matrix element calculation would be necessary for a more reliable prediction of this background.

Meanwhile, these calculations are provided by the AcerMC generator [8]. Since there are also new versions of the parton density functions available, it is necessary to illuminate the \(\mathrm{t}\overline{\mathrm{t}}\mathrm{H}\), \(\mathrm{H}\to\mathrm{b}\bar{\mathrm{b}}\) channel again. We reinvestigate the discovery potential in the present situation using updated cross sections and the matrix element based generation of the main background.

This note is organized as follows:

In Section 2 and 3 we introduce the signal and background processes and describe the event generation and simulation with the fast detector parametrization. Section 4 explains the reconstruction and selection procedure used in the tdr and presents the results for the application of this method to the presently used Monte Carlo samples. The section includes a comparison with the results obtained in the tdr. Section 5 introduces several methods to improve the analysis in the reconstruction of the final state and the signal-background discrimination. The results are compared to the tdr method from Section 4. In Section 6 we propose a procedure to determine the shape and normalization of the background with the help of data so that only little information from Monte Carlo simulations is needed. The results are summarized in Section 7. The Appendices A- C give additional explanation on the jet pairing and the likelihood technique, and show Feynman diagrams for the signal and background. Appendix D is dedicated to a comparison between the atlas and the CMS analysis of the \(\mathrm{t}\overline{\mathrm{t}}\mathrm{H}\), \(\mathrm{H}\to\mathrm{b}\bar{\mathrm{b}}\) channel.

## 2 Signal and background processes

Some sample diagrams for the signal and the background processes are shown in Figures 34-36 on page 3. The \(\mathrm{t}\overline{\mathrm{t}}\mathrm{H}\) state is produced via gluon-gluon interaction in about 90 % and in quark-quark interaction in 10 % of all cases (the situation is vice versa at \(\mathrm{p}\bar{\mathrm{p}}\)-colliders such as the tevatron).

Top quarks decay almost exclusively into Wb, and W bosons decay hadronically in about 2/3 of all cases, and into lepton plus neutrino in about 1/3 of all cases. The final state with the highest branching fraction is \(\mathrm{j}\mathrm{j}\mathrm{b}\,\mathrm{j}\mathrm{j}\mathrm{b}\,\mathrm{b}\) which is difficult to separate from the overwhelming qcd background processes. To have a handle for triggering \(\mathrm{t}\overline{\mathrm{t}}\mathrm{H}\) events, one requires one top quark to decay semileptonically, leading to a final state of \(\ell\nu\mathrm{b}\ \mathrm{j}\mathrm{j}\mathrm{b}\ \mathrm{b}\) with 6 jets (4 of which are b-jets), 1 lepton and missing transverse momentum. Concerning the lepton we consider only \(\ell\) = e or \(\mu\).

The main background to the signal process arises from top quark-pair production with additional jets from initial or final state radiation. The cross section for this background is about 900 times larger than for the signal, but only a small fraction consists of true \(\mathrm{t}\overline{\mathrm{t}}\mathrm{b}\bar{\mathrm{b}}\) events. Therefore a high-performance b-tagging algorithm which efficiently tags b-jets while strongly rejecting non-b-jets is crucial for this analysis. There is also a less severe irreducible \(\mathrm{t\bar{t}b\bar{b}}\) background which originates through the mediation of electroweak gauge bosons, gg\(\rightarrow\)Z/\(\gamma\)/W\(\rightarrow\)\(\mathrm{t\bar{t}b\bar{b}}\) (also denoted as '\(\mathrm{t\bar{t}b\bar{b}}\) (ew)' in the text). The cross section for these processes is nine times smaller than the \(\mathrm{t\bar{t}b\bar{b}}\) production from qcd. In the earlier study of this channel only the resonant contribution of this ew-background was taken into account. With the availability of the AcerMC Monte Carlo program it is now possible to evaluate also the non-resonant part which might give a non negligible contribution for Higgs boson masses above the Z mass. The \(\mathrm{t\bar{t}b\bar{b}}\) background is generated on the basis of matrix element calculations. In leading order there are 38 diagrams for the process gg\(\rightarrow\)\(\mathrm{t\bar{t}b\bar{b}}\), 7 diagrams for \(\mathrm{q\bar{q}}\rightarrow\)\(\mathrm{t\bar{t}b\bar{b}}\), and 72 diagrams for gg\(\rightarrow\)Z/\(\gamma\)/W\(\rightarrow\)\(\mathrm{t\bar{t}b\bar{b}}\). Other backgrounds are negligible as well as small interference terms between the gg\(\rightarrow\)\(\mathrm{t\bar{t}b\bar{b}}\) and the gg\(\rightarrow\)Z/\(\gamma\)/W\(\rightarrow\)\(\mathrm{t\bar{t}b\bar{b}}\) processes. The cross sections for the signal in the mass range 100 GeV \(\leq m_{\mathrm{H}}\leq 140\) GeV and for the background processes are given in Tables 1 and 2.

## 3 Event generation and simulation

The signal \(\mathrm{t\bar{t}H}\), \(\mathrm{H}\rightarrow\mathrm{b\bar{b}}\) and the samples of the reducible background (\(\mathrm{t\bar{t}jj}\)) are generated with pythia 6.203 [6]. The irreducible background from gg\(\rightarrow\)\(\mathrm{t\bar{t}b\bar{b}}\), \(\mathrm{q\bar{q}}\rightarrow\mathrm{t\bar{t}b\bar{b}}\), and gg\(\rightarrow\)Z/\(\gamma\)/W\(\rightarrow\)\(\mathrm{t\bar{t}b\bar{b}}\) is generated with AcerMC 1.0 [8]. In order to avoid double counting the \(\mathrm{t\bar{t}jj}\) events are filtered at the generator level so that the quarks from which the additional jets 'jj' evolve are not b-quarks. The events are passed through the fast simulation of the atlas detector, atlas 2.60 [9].

An efficiency of 90 % to identify charged leptons is assumed, and a b-tag efficiency of 60 % to reconstruct true b-jets and rejection factors of \(\mathrm{R_{c}}=10\) and \(\mathrm{R_{j}}=100\) for c-jets and light jets are chosen. A cone algorithm with a radius of \(\Delta\mathrm{R}=0.4\) is used to reconstruct jets [10]. The jet energy and momentum is calibrated using the atlastb routines from the simulation package. Figure 3 shows the number of jets with \(p_{T}>20\) GeV and the number of jets tagged as b-jets for signal events and the main backgrounds.

The signal process is generated in a mass range \(m_{\mathrm{H}}=\)80-140 GeV in steps of 10 GeV. Other background processes than those listed in Table 2 are negligible [5]. The cteq5l parton density functions are used for all signal and background samples. The cross sections for the signal are calculated with the hqq program [11], and the branching

ratio of H\(\rightarrow\)\(\rm b\bar{b}\) is calculated with the hdecay program [4]. The branching ratio used for \(\rm t\bar{t}\rightarrow\ell\nu b\,jjb\) is 0.2914. The cross sections for the background processes are taken as provided by the event generators.

In leading order calculations both the signal and the background cross sections are very sensitive to the choice of the qcd renormalization and factorization scale, \(Q_{\rm QCD}^{2}\), which is taken to be the same for both scales. For the \(\rm t\bar{t}b\bar{b}\) background a difference of up to a factor 4 can be observed, depending on the \(Q_{\rm QCD}^{2}\) choice, as has been pointed out in Ref. [8]. The signal process shows a similar dependency. In the present analysis \(Q_{\rm QCD}^{2}=(m_{\rm t}+m_{\rm H}/2)^{2}\) is used, following Ref. [12] and [13]. However, since this scale can not be chosen in pythia, the ttij cross section is calculated with the default setting \(Q_{\rm QCD}^{2}=\left(m_{\rm t}^{2}+p_{T}^{2}\right)\). Next-to-leading order corrections to the \(\rm t\bar{t}H\) signal cross sections have been calculated in [12] and [13]. These corrections stabilize the \(Q_{\rm QCD}^{2}\) dependency and enhance the signal cross section by about 20 % at \(Q_{\rm QCD}^{2}=(m_{\rm t}+m_{\rm H}/2)^{2}\). However, since no next-to-leading order calculations exist for the background all K-factors are set to Unity in this analysis.

#### Parton-Jet matching

There is no direct link between the generated partons (the 'Monte Carlo truth') and the reconstructed jets and leptons. In order to gather information about correct jet pairing it is therefore necessary to match the partons to the jets. This is done via a simple \(\Delta\)R matching criterion: For each parton the jet with the smallest distance \(\Delta\)R is matched to the parton. The distance \(\Delta\)R must be less than 1.0. If no associated jet exists within \(\Delta\)R \(<\) 1.0 then no parton-jet matching is possible. A jet is matched to only one parton. For all the six initial quarks in signal events (2 b-quarks from the Higgs boson decay, 3 quarks from the hadronic top-quark decay, and 1 b-quark from the semileptonic top-quark decay) an associated jet can be found in 78 % of all cases.

It should be noted that this procedure can lead to incorrect assignment if the direction of the jet differs significantly from that of the initial parton, _e.g._ if after final state radiation of gluons the decay products of the parton are reconstructed by the jet finder as several jets. As a matter of fact the quoted 78 % efficiency for the parton-jet matching is high compared to the efficiency for single jet reconstruction given in Ref [9] (around 80%, but for \(\Delta\)R \(<0.4\)). This indicated that there is a substantial amount of incorrect parton-jet associations due to the relatively high jet multiplicity from ISR and FSR.

## 4 'TDR' analysis of the \(\ell\nu\)b jjb bb final state

The same event reconstruction procedure as in Ref. [5] was applied in order to achieve an adequate comparison between the tdr results and the present situation. This procedure is referred to as the 'tdr method' in the following (although some of the cut values are different from those in the tdr analysis). It aims at reconstructing the complete final state of the event to minimize the combinatorial background when assigning two of the four b-jets to the Higgs boson decay. The tdr method consists of three steps: A preselection, the reconstruction of the \(\mathrm{t}\overline{\mathrm{t}}\mathrm{H}\rightarrow\mathrm{t}\overline{ \mathrm{t}}\mathrm{b}\overline{\mathrm{b}}\) final state, and cuts on the reconstructed top quark and Higgs boson masses.

### Preselection

A preselection is applied to select only events which are compatible with the signal topology of four b-jets, two non-b-jets and one lepton. This preselection reduces the size of the event samples, primarily the \(\mathrm{t}\overline{\mathrm{t}}\) +jets events. The preselection requires

* at least 1 isolated lepton (\(\ell=\) e or \(\mu\)) with transverse momentum \(p_{T}^{e}>25\) GeV, \(p_{T}^{\mu}>20\) GeV and pseudorapidity \(|\eta|<2.5\),
* at least 6 jets with \(p_{T}>20\) GeV and \(|\eta|<5\),
* at least 4 of these jets must be tagged as b-jets.

After the preselection the signal to background ratio is enhanced by a factor of 50.

The next steps are the reconstruction of the two W bosons. After that two out of all b-jets are assigned to the two top quark decays by a minimization procedure which involves the reconstructed W bosons. The Higgs boson in signal events is reconstructed from the remaining b-jets.

### Reconstruction of W\(\rightarrow\ell\nu\)

To fully reconstruct the leptonic W decay, one needs to reconstruct the four-vector of the neutrino momentum (we assume \(m_{\nu}=0\) so that \(E_{\nu}=|\vec{p}_{\nu}|\)). In contrast to \(p_{\nu}^{x}\) and \(p_{\nu}^{y}\), which are identified with \(p_{\mathrm{miss}}^{x}\) and \(p_{\mathrm{miss}}^{y}\), one cannot measure \(p_{\nu}^{z}\) in the detector. Instead, it can be calculated by constraining the invariant mass of the lepton-neutrino system to the W mass. If there is more than one isolated lepton the one with the largestvalue of \(p_{T}\) is chosen. Hence, the missing part of the neutrino momentum is obtained by solving Equation 1 for \(p_{\nu}^{z}\).

\[m_{\mathrm{W}}^{2}=(E_{\nu}+E_{\ell})^{2}-(p_{\nu}^{x}+p_{\ell}^{x})^{2}-\left(p _{\nu}^{y}+p_{\ell}^{y}\right)^{2}-(p_{\nu}^{z}+p_{\ell}^{z})^{2} \tag{1}\]

Solving this equation results in 0, 1 or 2 solutions. No solution can be found if there is a significant mismeasurement of \(p_{\mathrm{miss}}^{T}\) or of the jet energy and momentum. Events are kept only if there exists at least 1 solution. This condition is satisfied for about 75 % of the events in signal and background. If there are 2 solutions then both are kept for further evaluation in the top quark reconstruction.

The resolution of the reconstructed neutrino momentum is shown in Figure 4 for \(p_{\nu}^{x}\) and \(p_{\nu}^{z}\) for fully reconstructed events. A Gaussian is fitted to the peak of the distribution, and a width of \(\sigma=15.9\) GeV is obtained for \(p_{\nu}^{x,y}\) and \(\sigma=20.7\) GeV for \(p_{\nu}^{z}\). The resolution for \(p_{\nu}^{z}\) is worse because its calculation introduces measurement errors from six variables \((E_{\ell},p_{\mathrm{miss}}^{x},p_{\mathrm{miss}}^{y},p_{\ell}^{x},p_{\ell}^{y },p_{\ell}^{z}\) and neglecting the natural width of \(m_{\mathrm{W}}\)). One observes large tails from events where the wrong out of the two solutions for \(p_{\nu}^{z}\) was chosen in the process of the top quark reconstruction (cf. section 4.4).

### Reconstruction of W\(\rightarrow\) jj

To reconstruct the hadronic W decay, a list of jet-pairs is build. Only jets which are not tagged as b-jets, and which have \(p_{T}>20\) GeV are taken into account. In the list, only jet-pairs with \(m_{\mathrm{jj}}=m_{\mathrm{W}}\pm 25\) GeV are kept. For all jet-jet-pairs which fulfill these

The distributions are shown for events after the reconstruction of the final state where one solution for \(p_{\nu}^{x}\) has been chosen. The histograms are normalized to Unity

requirements, the jet four-momenta are rescaled so that \(m_{\mathrm{jj}}\) equals \(m_{\mathrm{W}}\). In about 20 % of the signal events no jet-pair candidate can be found that passes these requirements. These events are rejected. Figure 5 shows the invariant jet-jet masses for all pairs. On average there are 2.5 jet-pairs in signal events that lie inside the mass window, 3.0 such pairs for the irreducible \(\mathrm{t\bar{t}b\bar{b}}\) background and 1.6 pairs for the reducible \(\mathrm{t\bar{t}jj}\) background. The jet multiplicity in the \(\mathrm{t\bar{t}jj}\) events is smaller since in pythia only the top quark pair is produced in the hard process, and additional jets emerge from the parton shower. In \(\mathrm{t\bar{t}b\bar{b}}\) events generated with AcerMC and interfaced to pythia these jets are produced in addition to the final state with two top quarks and two b-quarks.

At this stage the complete list of jet-pairs inside the acceptance window is kept, and the decision which pair is chosen for the reconstruction of the hadronic W decay is made in the process of the top quark reconstruction (cf. next section).

The angular difference \(\Delta\mathrm{R}\) between the generated and the reconstructed W bosons is shown in Figure 6 for the leptonic and the hadronic W decay.

### Reconstruction of the two top quarks

After reconstruction of the leptonic W decay, and building the list of jet-pair candidates for the hadronic W decay one needs to find the appropriate b-jets from the top quark decays. This is done simultaneously for both top quarks by finding the combination of one charged lepton, the solution for \(p_{\nu}^{z}\), two b-jets and two non-b-jets from the list of jet-pairs which minimizes

\[\Delta^{2}=(m_{\ell\nu\mathrm{b}}-m_{\mathrm{t}})^{2}+(m_{\mathrm{jj}b}-m_{ \mathrm{t}})^{2}. \tag{2}\]

luminosity of 30 fb\({}^{-1}\).

Since the main background cumulates at masses below 90 GeV a mass cut is introduced to select only events around the signal mass peak. Selected events must lie within \(m_{\rm H}\pm 30\) GeV.

#### A closer look at the reconstructed mass spectra

The shape of the reconstructed mass spectra is significantly different from the distribution of the partons. This is not only due to effects from the detector resolution. An important role play the misidentification of light jets as b-jets and the incorrect association of b-jets from the decay of the Higgs boson to the hadronic and the semi-leptonic top quark decay. These two effects have a big impact on the shape of the background.

In order to investigate this the \(\rm t\bar{t}b\bar{b}\) background is studied in more detail. The sample is divided into two complementary subsamples:

1. A subset where at least on light jet is misidentified as a b-jet or vice versa ('fake jets').
2. A subset with correct identification of the jet flavors ('true jets'). This sample is further split into two subsets 1. with correct association of the b-jets and light jets to the top quark decays ('correct pairing'), 2. with at least one incorrect association ('wrong pairing').

Figure 9: Difference \(\Delta\)R between the generated and the reconstructed top quarks. The histograms are normalized to Unity.

The resulting distributions are plotted in Figure 13. There is a significant shift towards higher masses due to the contribution of events with fake jets, which make about \(40\,\%\) out of all events. This fraction has of course a strong dependence on the b-tagging performance, and the numbers given here are valid for \(\varepsilon_{\mathrm{b}}=0.6\), \(\mathrm{R_{j}}=100\), \(\mathrm{R_{c}}=10\).

The fraction of events with 'true jets' follows closer the shape of the original partons, although the tail to higher masses is more pronounced due to incorrect jet pairing. The fraction of events with correct pairing is only about \(32\,\%\) of the events with true jets, but it is close to the parton distribution. This indicates that the jet calibration as provided by the atlasb-routines works well.

For the signal the effect of fake jets and incorrect pairing is less distinct, but nevertheless visible in larger tails and as an accumulation of events on the left side of the peak as shown in Figure 14.

This overall shift to higher masses of the background and the broadening of the signal distribution has a negative impact on the signal to background ratio in the region of the Higgs boson peak. The fraction of fake jets can be reduced by selecting a b-tag with higher rejection power against light and c-jets, but this is always at the cost of efficiency for finding true b-jets. It turns out that the choice of \(\varepsilon_{b}=60\,\%\) is optimal in terms of \(S/\sqrt{B}\).

The conclusion for this study is that there are two areas where improvements could bring the reconstructed mass shapes closer to the parton level distributions: 1. enhanced b-tagging performance with higher rejection factors against light- and c-jets 2. improved

jet-pairing so that the fraction of events where the wrong b-jets are assigned to the decay of the Higgs boson is reduced.

### Results for the TDR reconstruction method

We summarize the steps of the classical analysis:

1. selection of events with \(\geq\)1 isolated lepton, at least 6 jets, 4 of which are tagged as b-jets,
2. reconstruction of the neutrino four-vector,
3. making a list of non-b jet pairs with \(|m_{\rm jj}-m_{\rm W}|<25\) GeV,
4. finding the combination of \(p_{\nu}^{z}\), 4 b-jets and 2 non-b jets which gives invariant masses \(m_{\ell\nu{\rm b}}\) and \(m_{\rm jjb}\) closest to \(m_{\rm t}\), keeping only events with \(|m_{\ell\nu{\rm b}}-m_{\rm t}|<20\) GeV and \(|m_{\rm jjb}-m_{\rm t}|<20\) GeV.
5. calculating \(m_{\rm bb}\) of the remaining b-jets with largest \(p_{T}\) and keeping events with \(|m_{\rm bb}-m_{\rm H}|<30\) GeV.

The efficiencies and the number of expected events for a luminosity of 30 fb\({}^{-1}\) for these steps of the analysis are reported in Table 3 and 4 for the selection of a Higgs boson with a mass of 120 GeV. The signal efficiency is 0.8 %, and 26 signal events and 181 background events are expected after 3 years of running at low luminosity (10 fb

per year). The irreducible \(\mathrm{t\bar{t}b\bar{b}}\) background accounts for 77 % of the total background for the b-tag parametrization described in section 3.

The results for other Higgs boson masses are given in Table 5 for \(m_{\mathrm{H}}=80\) GeV to \(m_{\mathrm{H}}=140\) GeV. Although the existence of a Standard Model Higgs boson below 114.4 GeV has been ruled out by the LEP experiments at the 95 % confidence level ([14]), the signal efficiency and expected background rates for masses below this limit are of interest for scans of the parameter space in models beyond the Standard Model, _e.g_ in the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model. The significance for a 120 GeV Higgs boson is \(S/\sqrt{B}=1.9\) and falls rapidly for higher masses due to both the decreasing \(\mathrm{t\bar{t}H}\) cross section and the smaller branching ratio \(\mathrm{H\to b\bar{b}}\). In Table 5 the significances are expressed both as \(S/\sqrt{B}\) and as Poissonian significances \(\sigma_{\mathrm{Poisson}}\).

### Comparison with results from the TDR

In this section we describe the changes in the \(\mathrm{t\bar{t}H}\), H\(\rightarrow\)bb channel with respect to the tdr analysis [5]. The focus in the tdr analysis is on a Higgs boson mass of 100 GeV, and so we use the same mass in this comparison.

Changes have taken place in the cross section calculations, in the Monte Carlo generators and detector simulation, and in the preselection.

#### 4.7.1 Cross sections

The tdr cross sections were calculated with cteq4l parton density functions. The change to the cteq5l pdfs results in a general decrease of the cross sections by about 20 %. The leading order cross sections show a strong dependency on the choice of the \(Q_{\mathrm{QCD}}^{2}\) scale. The tdr analysis used the default choices in pythia (which in general depend on the process) whereas the scale in the current analysis is set to \(Q_{\mathrm{QCD}}^{2}=(m_{\mathrm{t}}+m_{\mathrm{H}}/2)^{2}\), with the exception of the \(\mathrm{t\bar{t}jj}\) background where the pythia default is used as well. The signal cross sections and branching ratios for H\(\rightarrow\)bb are now taken from dedicated programs, hqq[11] and hdecay[4], which give more accurate results.

The cross sections quoted in the tdr were obtained for the leptonic decay of one W (\(\ell=\mathrm{e}\;\mathrm{or}\;\mu\)) and arbitrary decay of the other W. We normalize them to the inclusive cross sections and compare in Table 6 the numbers to the cross sections from Tables 1 and 2.

#### 4.7.2 Monte Carlo generators

In both analyses the signal events and the reducible \(\mathrm{t\bar{t}jj}\) background are generated with pythia (version 5.7 and 6.2). In the tdr the irreducible \(\mathrm{t\bar{t}bb}\) background and \(\mathrm{t\bar{t}Z}\) events are generated with pythia, whereas these samples are generated by AcerMC in the current analysis. Significant changes are expected for the \(\mathrm{t\bar{t}bb}\) background in particular, because the parton shower approach in pythia tends to underestimate this background.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{c c c} \hline \hline  & tdr & this analysis \\ \hline pdf & cteq4l & cteq5l \\ \(Q_{\mathrm{QCD}}^{2}\) & \((m_{\mathrm{t}}^{2}+p_{T}^{2})\) & \((m_{\mathrm{t}}+m_{\mathrm{H}}/2)^{2}\) \\ Generators & pythia 5.7 & pythia 6.2 \\  & & AcerMC 1.0 \\ \hline \(\mathrm{t\bar{t}H}\) (100) & 1.20 pb & 0.84 pb \\ \(\mathrm{t\bar{t}H}\) (120) & 0.72 pb & 0.52 pb \\ \(\mathrm{t\bar{t}}\) +jets & 600 pb & 491 pb \\ \(\mathrm{t\bar{t}Z}\rightarrow\mathrm{t\bar{t}bb}\) & 0.57 pb & \\ gg\(\rightarrow\)Z/\(\gamma\)/W\(\rightarrow\)\(\mathrm{t\bar{t}bb\bar{b}}\) & 0.89 pb \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}

Figure 15 demonstrates that the events generated with the matrix element calculations in AcerMC have a slightly harder \(p_{T}\) spectrum of the b-jets, and a higher multiplicity of jets shown here for jets with \(p_{T}>20\) GeV.

The tdr analysis takes into account only the resonant contribution from \(\mathrm{t}\bar{\mathrm{t}}\mathrm{Z}\to\)\(\mathrm{t}\bar{\mathrm{t}}\mathrm{b}\bar{\mathrm{b}}\) events. In the current analysis we use the full contribution from gg\(\to\)Z/\(\gamma\)/W\(\to\)\(\mathrm{t}\bar{\mathrm{t}}\mathrm{b}\bar{\mathrm{b}}\) processes which are available with the AcerMC generator.

#### 4.7.3 Reconstruction and event selection

The same reconstruction procedure is used for the tdr and the current analysis, but different \(p_{T}\) cuts are applied to account for the raised trigger thresholds. The changes are summarized in Table 7.

In Table 8 we compare the properties of the reconstructed top-quark and Higgs boson masses in \(\mathrm{t}\bar{\mathrm{t}}\mathrm{H}\) events with \(m_{\mathrm{H}}=100\) GeV. The same mass resolution is achieved for the reconstruction of the semi-leptonic top-quark decay. A slightly better resolution is observed for \(m_{\mathrm{jjb}}\) and \(m_{\mathrm{bb}}\) with the current analysis due to an updated parametrization in the jet calibration [7].

The total selection efficiencies cannot be compared directly since the tdr analysis starts from a wider set of decay modes (one leptonic W decay is required with arbitrary decay of the other W). We compare here the efficiencies of the mass cuts on \(m_{\ell\nu\mathrm{b}}\), \(m_{\mathrm{jjb}}\), and \(m_{\mathrm{bb}}\) in the selection for a 100 GeV Higgs boson.

The efficiencies of the \(m_{\ell\nu\mathrm{b}}\) and \(m_{\mathrm{jjb}}\) cuts are 30 % larger (relative) in the current analysis than in the tdr analysis. This increase in the efficiency corresponds to the smaller width of the reconstructed top-quarks masses (Table 8). Since topological and kinematic properties of the irreducible background generated by AcerMC are much closer to the ones of the signal process, the efficiency of the \(\mathrm{t}\bar{\mathrm{t}}\mathrm{b}\bar{\mathrm{b}}\) background is almost the same as for \(\mathrm{t}\bar{\mathrm{t}}\mathrm{H}\) events. A better mass resolution of \(m_{\mathrm{bb}}\) yields also higher efficiency for the \(m_{\mathrm{bb}}\) cut. A significantly larger efficiency is observed in the case of the \(\mathrm{t}\bar{\mathrm{t}}\mathrm{jj}\)Figure 15: Comparison between the parton shower approach and the matrix element calculation for the \(\mathrm{t\bar{t}b\bar{b}}\) background. Shown is the \(\mathrm{p_{T}}\) spectrum for all jets and for b-jets (top row), and the number of jets and b-jets with \(\mathrm{p_{T}}>20\) GeV after jet calibration (bottom row). The histograms are normalized to Unity.

background, and further work is needed to understand this difference.

Finally, the tdr analysis selects 61 signal events and expects 150 events from background (dominated by 130 events from tt+jets). With the current analysis 49 signal events and 211 background events (159 events from \(\mathrm{t\bar{t}b\bar{b}}\)) are expected. These numbers refer to the selection for a 100 GeV Higgs boson. The significant increase in the background arises from the more reliable prediction of the irreducible \(\mathrm{t\bar{t}b\bar{b}}\) background based on matrix element calculations and from the inclusion of the complete \(\mathrm{t\bar{t}b\bar{b}}\) background mediated by weak gauge bosons.

### Conclusions on the TDR reconstruction method

It has been shown that with the current knowledge the sensitivity of the channel \(\mathrm{t\bar{t}H}\), \(\mathrm{H\to}\mathrm{b\bar{b}}\) is smaller than the results given in the tdr. For \(m_{\mathrm{H}}=100\) GeV the expected significance is 3.4 compared to 5.0 in the tdr. For \(m_{\mathrm{H}}=120\) GeV the expected significance is 1.9 compared to 3.6 in the tdr. These changes are due to a more precise estimate of the irreducible \(\mathrm{t\bar{t}b\bar{b}}\) background and changes in the cross section for both signal and background with the introduction of the cteq5l structure functions and the choice of a different \(Q_{\mathrm{QCD}}^{2}\) scale.

It has also been noted that the influence of the light-jet rejection and the jet pairing on the reconstructed distributions of \(m_{\mathrm{bb}}\) is significant, and further work on these items can improve the sensitivity of the \(\mathrm{t\bar{t}H}\) channel, see the next section.

Improved analysis

The improvement of the atlas b-tagging performance is not subject of this work, and therefore we concentrate on possible improvements of the reconstruction and analysis procedure in the \(\mathrm{t}\mathrm{\bar{t}}\mathrm{H}\) channel. Three fields seem to be promising:

**Top quark reconstruction:**: As described in section 4.2 about \(25\,\%\) of all events are lost because the \(z\)-component of the neutrino momentum and therefore the semileptonic top quark decay can not be reconstructed. A method to determine or approximate \(p_{\nu}^{z}\) if the calculation from Equation 1 fails could recover these events.
**Jet pairing:**: The jet multiplicity in both the signal and background events is high, and so is the number of combinatorial choices to match six jets to the decay products of the two top quarks and the Higgs boson. More details can be found in Appendix A. With the tdr reconstruction method the two b-jets assigned to the Higgs boson actually stem from the Higgs boson decay for only \(27\,\%\) of the reconstructed signal events in the whole \(m_{\mathrm{bb}}\) mass range. This is still an improvement considering the fact that without the reconstruction of the top quarks the probability to select the correct b-jets out of all b-jets is less than \(17\,\%\). For events inside the mass window \(m_{\mathrm{H}}\pm 30\) GeV this fraction increases to about \(51\,\%\). An improved jet pairing would sharpen the signal peak and bring the background shape closer to the true shape where the bulk of the distribution is located at masses below \(80\) GeV, cf. Figures 13 and 14.
**Final event selection**: for events inside the \(m_{\mathrm{bb}}\) acceptance window: The restriction by a cut on \(m_{\mathrm{bb}}\) in order to select only events in the mass region where the signal is expected reduces the background by \(70\)-\(80\,\%\) (depending on \(m_{\mathrm{H}}\)). This is to be compared to the loss in the signal which is about \(55\,\%\). Exploiting differences in the event topology for the events surviving this mass cut may reveal further means to discriminate signal from background.

### Top quark reconstruction

The same preselection as described in section 4.1 is used.

The problem that \(p_{\nu}^{z}\) can not be calculated in about \(25\%\) of the events arises if the measured transverse mass of the lepton-neutrino system is larger than the W mass. This happens mainly due to a significant mismeasurement of \(p_{\mathrm{miss}}^{x}\) or \(p_{\mathrm{miss}}^{y}\). For such events (denoted in the following as events with no solution, \(n_{\mathrm{sol}}=0\)) the neutrino and the lepton are close in the \(z\)-direction but separated in \(x\) and \(y\). For events with \(n_{\mathrm{sol}}\geq 1\) the situation is vice versa, as is depicted in Figure 16.

To recover events with \(n_{\mathrm{sol}}=0\) the approximation \(p_{\nu}^{z}=p_{\ell}^{z}\) is made (collinear approximation). To constrain the invariant mass \(m_{\ell\nu}\) to the W mass, the neutrino four-momentum is scaled so that \(m_{\ell\nu}=m_{\mathrm{W}}\). The resolution of \(p_{\nu}^{z}\) is shown in Figure 17. This procedure increases the efficiency for the reconstruction of the leptonic W decay to \(100\,\%\). A small degradation of the mass resolution of the top quark decay is observed. Including the events with \(n_{\rm sol}=0\) the resolution degrades from 8.6 GeV to 9.1 GeV.

### Jet pairing

In the tdr method to find the correct jets from the top quark decays the combination which minimizes the expression \((m_{\ell\nu{\rm b}}-m_{\rm t})^{2}+(m_{\rm jjb}-m_{\rm t})^{2}\) is chosen. This recipe makes use of the invariant top quark masses only and does not take into account additional information like, for example, spatial distances between jets.

The jet pairing can possibly be improved by using additional information from the event topology. The most promising variables are

1. \(m_{\rm jj}\): the invariant mass of the pair of light jets from the hadronic W decay,
2. \(m_{\rm jjb}\): the invariant mass of the two light jets and one b-jet from the hadronic top quark decay,
3. \(\Delta{\rm R}(\ell,{\rm b})\): the distance in R between the lepton and the b-jet assumed to originate from the same top quark,
4. \(m_{\ell\nu{\rm b}}\): the invariant mass of the lepton, the reconstructed neutrino and one b-jet coming from the semileptonic top quark decay,
5. \(\Delta{\rm R}\) (b,jj): the distance in R between the b-jet and the system of light jets from the hadronic top quark decay,

Right: difference in \({\rm p_{z}}\). The full histograms are normalized to unity, and the dashed histograms according to the ratio of events with \(n_{\rm sol}=0\) to events with \(n_{\rm sol}>0\).

6. \(\angle\)(j,j): the angle between the two light jets from the hadronic W decay,

These variables are shown in Figure 18. The reference distributions are created from signal events for correct and all wrong combinations of the jet pairing. If there is more than one solution for \(p_{\nu}^{z}\) the one which minimizes \(|m_{\ell\nu\mathrm{b}}-m_{\mathrm{t}}|\) is selected. In the analysis for each possible combination a pairing likelihood is calculated from these distributions, and the one with the highest likelihood is chosen. The likelihood technique is explained in Appendix B, and the distribution of the likelihood output _pLH_ for correct and wrong combinations in signal events is displayed in Figure 19. Events are kept only if \(pLH>0.7\) to assure a good quality of the jet pairing. The efficiency for this cut is \(95\,\%\).

The likelihood method is compared to the tdr method in Figure 20 and in Table 10. With the likelihood method the peak of the distributions is being reconstructed at slightly lower masses, and the width increases by about \(2.0\;\mathrm{GeV}\). However, the purity of the jet pairing is higher for the likelihood reconstruction (the purity \(\mathcal{P}^{b}\) given in Table 10 refers only to the b-jets in the top quark decays). This means that the simple matching criterion used in the tdr method introduces a small bias in the mass distributions towards the expected top quark masses. As a consequence we do not apply a cut on the reconstructed top quark masses any longer, thus gaining another \(20\,\%\) of efficiency. On the other hand, loosening cuts on the reconstructed masses could introduce additional backgrounds which do not contain a pair of top-quarks. This issue is discussed in section 5.5.

The likelihood output distributions have a sharp peak at 0 for wrong combinations and at 1 for correct combinations. Nevertheless, the gain in purity with the likelihood pairing is rather small (a few percent). This can be explained by the high multiplicity of wrong combinations, see section A. The absolute normalization in Figure 19 is arbitrary, but the relative normalization between correct and wrong combinations is conserved. For

5. \(m_{\rm bb}^{(1)}\): the combination with the smallest invariant mass \(m_{\rm bb}\) out of the six combinations which are possible when selecting two b-jets out of four b-jets.

7. \(\phi_{\rm t_{1}}-\phi_{\rm t_{2}}\): the difference in phi between the reconstructed top quarks,
8. \(p_{T}^{\rm t_{1}}+p_{T}^{\rm t_{2}}\): the sum of the transverse momenta of the reconstructed top quarks.

These variables are shown in Figure 23 for the signal \(\rm t\bar{t}H\), the irreducible \(\rm t\bar{t}b\bar{b}\), and the reducible \(\rm t\bar{t}jj\) background. A 3-class likelihood is used to combine the distributions into a single output (there is no specific class for the \(\rm t\bar{t}b\bar{b}\) (EW) background).

The output distributions of the final likelihoods, _fLH_, for a 120 GeV signal and for the irreducible \(\rm t\bar{t}b\bar{b}\) and the reducible \(\rm t\bar{t}jj\) background are shown in Figure 24. A cut is placed at 0.35, and only events with a likelihood above this threshold are selected. The position of the cut is optimized for the best value of \(S/\sqrt{B}\). The sum of the likelihood distributions for all backgrounds and the signal is shown in Figure 25 normalized to the expected event rate for a luminosity of 30 \(\rm fb^{-1}\).

The likelihood input distributions are determined separately for each Higgs boson mass. The optimal position of the likelihood cut is also explored for each mass separately, but it turns out that a cut at 0.35 is optimal for all masses between 80 and 140 GeV.

The efficiency of this cut in the selection for a 120 GeV Higgs boson is 85 % for the signal and 63 % for the total background. This reflects in a relative increase of the

significance by \(8\,\%\) after the cut on _fLH_. Figure 26 shows the reconstructed \(m_{\rm bb}\) for signal and background events in the acceptance window \(m_{\rm H}\pm 30\) GeV before and after the final likelihood. An improvement in the signal to background ratio is visible after the cut on _fLH_.

### Results for the improved analysis

The efficiency and number of expected events for each consecutive step of the improved analysis are given in Table 12 for the selection of a 120 GeV Higgs boson. The average overall gain compared to the tdr method amounts to about \(43\,\%\) in \(S/\sqrt{B}\). The results for Higgs boson masses between 80 and 140 GeV are summarized in Table 13.

The significances for the observation of the signal, expressed as \(S/\sqrt{B}\), are plotted in Figure 27 versus the Higgs boson mass in the range \(m_{\rm H}=100\)-140 GeV. Curves are shown for the tdr method and the improved likelihood reconstruction methods as discussed in sections 4 and 5. A clear improvement in the expected significances with the collinear approximation and the likelihood methods can be observed compared to the reconstruction procedure used in the tdr. For a 120 GeV Higgs boson the significance can be raised by \(46\,\%\) from 1.9 to 2.8. In addition to the significances obtained with the analysis presented in this note, we show the original numbers for \(m_{\rm H}=100\) GeV and \(m_{\rm H}=120\) GeV from the tdr. There the expected significances where 5.0 and 3.6. The comparison with the current status for the tdr reconstruction _method_ (significances of 3.4 and 1.9) points up the large impact of the choice of the parton distribution functions and the \(Q^{2}\) scale, and the more precise description of the irreducible \(\rm t\bar{t}b\bar{b}\) background. To illustrate the effect of the smaller cross section, the numbers from the tdr have been scaled according to the cteq5l structure functions and the choice \(Q^{2}_{QCD}=(m_{t}+m_{\rm H}/2)^{2}\) but with the same composition of the background (_i.e._, the complete \(\rm t\bar{t}\) +jets background stems from pythia). One observes a degradation of the expected \(S/\sqrt{B}\) by about \(20\,\%\). The remaining difference between the scaled tdr numbers and the results from the tdr reconstruction method in this analysis arises from the higher jet multiplicity and the

The evolution of the expected signal and background events, the signal to background ratio, the purity of correct reconstruction, and the significances are detailed in Table 14 for the selection of a 120 GeV Higgs boson. Both the pairing likelihood and the final likelihood increase the fraction of events where the correct b-jets are assigned to the decay of the Higgs boson. The signal to background ratio is enhanced from 0.14 to 0.19 with the final likelihood. The significance is enhanced with each step of the improvements. The collinear approximation increases the significance by 14.4 %. Replacing the tdr reconstruction method by the pairing likelihood gains another 20.1 %. The final likelihood enhances the significance by 11.3 %. The total improvement on the significance is 46%.

### Discussion of mass cuts in the improved analysis

The improved analysis benefits mostly from an increased efficiency due to the collinear approximation and the introduction of likelihoods in the jet-pairing and in the final event selection. In the likelihood jet-pairing there is no a-priori restriction on the invariant mass of the jet-pair candidate supposed to originate from the hadronic W decay. It is left to the pairing likelihood to find the best combination out of all possible ones. The cut \(pLH>0.7\) ensures that events are rejected if no combination is found that resembles the characteristics of events with a top-quark pair.

No cut on the reconstructed top-quark masses is applied, since the fraction of correctly reconstructed events after all selection steps is found to be comparable to or even higher than the purity of the tdr reconstruction method. In Figure 28 we show the reconstructed hadronic W and the two top-quark masses in the improved analysis for

The table shows the purities, and the expected number of events for \(\mathcal{L}=30\) fb\({}^{-1}\) in the selection for a 120 GeV Higgs boson. \(\mathcal{P}_{bb}\) is the purity that the correct b-jets are assigned to the decay of the Higgs boson (‘all’ for events from the whole mass spectrum, and ‘window’ for the events in the mass window around the expected signal mass peak).

events with \(pLH>0.7\) (i.e., before the \(m_{\rm bb}\) cut and the final event selection), including the true distributions. The masses \(m_{\rm jj}\), \(m_{\ell\nu{\rm b}}\), and \(m_{\rm jjb}\) are reconstructed at the expected masses \(m_{\rm W}\) and \(m_{\rm t}\). Only small tails are observed, and they are not significantly larger than in the tdr reconstruction method which includes cuts on \(m_{\rm jj}\). This indicates that the pairing likelihood reconstructs the top quark masses in a reliable way and that it is robust against possible blur from the collinear approximation or from including the whole \(m_{\rm ii}\) mass range.

Nevertheless, there is no explicit cut requiring that the reconstructed masses \(m_{\ell\nu{\rm b}}\) and \(m_{\rm jjb}\) are close to the expected top mass. All events with a lepton, missing transverse momentum and 6 jets of which 4 are tagged as b-jets might be reconstructed, and it is not obvious that background processes _not_ containing a pair of top-quarks are negligible. Thus we verify with W+jets and tW events if those backgrounds need to be taken into account.

W+jets events are very unlikely to pass the preselection requirement of 6 jets and 4 b-jets, but this process has a huge cross section of \(\sigma\times{\rm BR}_{\rm W\to\ell\nu}=14470\,{\rm pb}\). The required number of b-tagged jets can be reached with real b-jets from gluon splitting or fake b-jets from the mis-tag of light jets. A control sample of 60 million W+jets event is generated with pythia. Single top events have a much smaller cross section \(\sigma\times{\rm BR}_{\rm tW\to\ell\nu jjb}\approx 11\,{\rm pb}\), but the event topology is closer to the required one with two top-quarks. In particular this is true for the process \({\rm gb}\)\(\to\)tW, where there is a top-quark and a W boson in the final state, and only one additional (fake) b-jet is necessary to mimic the final state of a pair of top-quarks. But still three mistagged jets are necessary in total for tW events to pass the preselection cuts. About 275 k tW events are generated with onetop[15] and 100 k events with toprex[16].

For statistic reasons it is not possible to use the b-tagging procedure from atlfastb. Instead, a random mis-tag is applied to the W+jets and tW events, so that each event contains 4 b-tagged jets. The events are reweighted to correspond to a b-tagging performance with \(\varepsilon_{\rm b}=0.6\), \({\rm R_{j}}=100\), \({\rm R_{c}}=10\). The full chain of reconstruction and selection is then applied to these events. Figure 29 shows the reconstructed masses \(m_{\rm jjb}\) and

in tW events with W\(\rightarrow\)jj, t\(\rightarrow\ell\nu\)b. Since there is only one top quark the attempt to reconstruct a second top quark results in a very broad mass distribution. Hence, single top events are unlikely to pass the cut on \(pLH\). The distribution of the pairing likelihood output is displayed in Figure 31. Only 29 % of the tW events fulfill \(pLH>0.7\) to be compared to an efficiency of 89 % for the signal and events from the irreducible t\(\overline{\rm tb}\)b background. The final likelihood selection provides further means to sort out this kind of background (Figure 31). The efficiency to pass the cut \(f\!LH\!>0.35\) is 27 % and thus only one third of the efficiency for backgrounds with two top quarks.

After all steps of the improved analysis the expected event rate for the W+jets and tW process for \({\cal L}=30\) fb\({}^{-1}\) is below the level of one event. Both onetop and toprex give comparable results. This small number is mainly due to the fact that the required number of b-labeled jets can only be reached from mistagged light- or c-jets. Even if the mis-tag rate was two or three times higher than the selected R\({}_{\rm j}=100\), R\({}_{\rm c}=10\), these backgrounds are still negligible compared to the other backgrounds.

In this section we have demonstrated that despite of omitting cuts on \(m_{\rm jj}\), \(m_{\ell\nu\rm b}\) and \(m_{\rm jjb}\) the improved analysis reconstructs and selects correctly events with two top-quarks. Processes with only one or no top-quark have a negligible contribution and can clearly be identified with both the pairing likelihood and the final likelihood.

Nevertheless, we report here the outcome for a modified improved analysis in which the two reconstructed masses \(m_{\ell\nu{\rm b}}\) and \(m_{\rm jjb}\) are required to be within \(m_{\rm t}\pm 20\GeV\). Since the efficiency of the cuts on the reconstructed top quark masses in the tdr method is around \(80\,\%\) for signal and background one expects a degradation of the significance by \(10\)-\(12\,\%\). This is in agreement with the actual results given in Table 15.

## 6 Systematic uncertainties

The analysis of the \(\mathrm{t\overline{t}H}\) channel suffers mainly from the large uncertainty in the prediction of the background from top quark pairs with additional jets. The leading-order cross section calculation is very sensitive to the choice of the \(Q^{2}_{\rm QCD}\) scale. This indicates significant contribution from higher order corrections which are not available at present. Therefore it is essential to _measure_ the rate of the \(\mathrm{t\overline{t}}\) +jets background from real data and to tune the Monte Carlo generators accordingly. For an extraction of the \(\mathrm{t\overline{t}H}\) signal peak in the \(m_{\rm bb}\) mass spectrum it is likewise important to know the shape of the background. It was emphasized in section 4.5 that the shape is influenced to a large extend by the rate of mistagged jets and the quality of the jet pairing to identify the correct decay products of the top quarks. The following is an attempt to derive a recipe to measure the \(\mathrm{t\overline{t}}\) +jets background in the \(\mathrm{t\overline{t}H}\) channel.

### Determining the shape

The first step is to determine the shape of the background. If this is done from the data, no or only little contribution from the \(\mathrm{t\overline{t}H}\) signal is allowed. To do so, the preselection described in Section 4.1 is applied to the \(\mathrm{t\overline{t}}\) +jets sample but with the following change: Instead of selecting events with at least four tagged b-jets, only events with exactly two

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{l r r r r r r} \hline \hline \(m_{\rm H}\) (GeV) & 80 & 90 & 100 & 110 & 120 & 130 & 140 \\ \hline \(\varepsilon_{\mathrm{t\overline{t}H}}\) (\%) & 0.97 & 1.03 & 0.99 & 0.99 & 0.95 & 0.90 & 0.85 \\ \hline \(\mathrm{t\overline{t}H}\) & 101.4 & 81.4 & 59.7 & 45.0 & 30.3 & 18.2 & 9.3 \\ \(\mathrm{t\overline{t}b\overline{b}}\) (qcd) & 149.2 & 142.8 & 128.7 & 116.9 & 101.2 & 85.5 & 73.9 \\ \(\mathrm{t\overline{t}jj}\) & 66.8 & 64.9 & 53.4 & 42.8 & 33.1 & 23.8 & 18.4 \\ \(\mathrm{t\overline{t}b\overline{b}}\) (ew) & 16.6 & 17.3 & 16.5 & 15.4 & 12.8 & 10.7 & 9.1 \\ total bkg. & 232.6 & 225.0 & 198.7 & 175.1 & 144.1 & 120.0 & 101.4 \\ \hline \(S/\sqrt{B}_{\rm modified}\) & 6.6 & 5.4 & 4.2 & 3.4 & 2.5 & 1.7 & 0.9 \\ \(\sigma_{\rm Poissonmodified}\) & 6.2 & 5.1 & 4.0 & 3.2 & 2.4 & 1.6 & 0.9 \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 15: Same as Table 13 but with cuts on the reconstructed top-quark masses as in the TDR reconstruction method.

b-jets are selected. The parametrization \(\varepsilon_{\rm b}=0.6\), \({\rm R_{j}}=100\), \({\rm R_{c}}=10\) is used. The efficiency for this selection for \({\rm t\bar{t}H}\) events is \(18.5\,\%\), and the ratio of \({\rm t\bar{t}H}\) to \({\rm t\bar{t}}\) +jets events after this modified preselection is \(2.7\times 10^{-3}\).

Two non-b-jets with \(p_{T}>20\) GeV are chosen by random and are labeled as b-jets. This sample is denoted as '\({\rm t\bar{t}jj}\)' in the following. Then the top reconstruction in the '\({\rm t\bar{t}jj}\)' sample is done in the usual way, and the \(m_{\rm bb}\) mass spectrum is calculated from the remaining two b-jets. In Figure 32 this spectrum is compared to the \(m_{\rm bb}\) spectrum obtained in the default selection from \({\rm t\bar{t}}\) +bb events (true and fake, generated by Pythia). Although the shapes are similar the peak region \(20\ {\rm GeV}<m_{\rm bb}<125\) GeV is not well described by the \({\rm t\bar{t}jj}\) control sample, and the spectrum cannot be used directly as an estimate for the \({\rm t\bar{t}b\bar{b}}\) background mass spectrum (the background in the selection for \(m_{\rm H}=120\) GeV would be underestimated by \(8.5\,\%\) in the cut window \(90\ {\rm GeV}<m_{\rm bb}<150\) GeV). Therefore a calibration function \(C\) is introduced to normalize the \(m_{\rm bb}\) distribution from the \({\rm t\bar{t}jj}\) control sample back to the \(m_{\rm bb}\) spectrum from the \({\rm t\bar{t}b\bar{b}}\) sample: \(C=H_{m_{\rm bb}}^{{\rm t\bar{t}b\bar{b}}}/H_{m_{\rm bb}}^{{\rm t\bar{t}jj}}\), where \(H_{m_{\rm bb}}^{{\rm t\bar{t}b\bar{b}}}\) and \(H_{m_{\rm bb}}^{{\rm t\bar{t}jj}}\) are the histogrammed mass spectra. The shape can then be determined by measuring from data the mass spectrum in a control sample of events with two b-jets and at least four additional non-b-jets and multiplying the obtained spectrum by the calibration function \(C\). This method is less sensitive to the modeling of the background in the MC generators since only the ratio of the shapes is used.

There is an ongoing study on how to quantify the systematic uncertainty of this procedure, and so we give here only the statistical error expected for \(30\ {\rm fb}^{-1}\) of collected data. In the whole \(m_{\rm bb}\) mass range there are about \(58\,000\) events expected for the \({\rm t\bar{t}jj}\) control sample. The efficiency for the mass cut \(|m_{\rm bb}-m_{\rm H}|<30\) GeV is \(\approx 28\,\%\) which leads to a relative statistical uncertainty for the cut of

\[\left(\frac{\Delta\varepsilon}{\varepsilon}\right)_{\rm stat.}\approx 1\,\%. \tag{3}\]

The contamination from \({\rm t\bar{t}H}\) signal events inside the mass window is only \(4\times 10^{-4}\)

Figure 32: Comparison of the mass spectra in the analysis for the \(\ell\nu\)bjjbbb final state and in the control sample with the \(\ell\nu\)bjjj final state. In both cases the events are generated with Pythia only. The histograms are normalized to Unity.

### Absolute normalization

The absolute normalization for the background can be determined in this analysis from the \(m_{\rm bb}\) mass spectrum in side bands were a negligible amount of signal events is expected. The side bands with \(m_{\rm bb}<50\) GeV and \(m_{\rm bb}>250\) GeV are chosen in this study. Due to the tails of the reconstructed \(m_{\rm bb}\) in signal events (see Fig. 10) it is not possible to choose side bands which are completely signal-free and have sufficient statistics in the background samples at the same time. For \({\cal L}=30\) fb\({}^{-1}\) and \(m_{\rm H}=120\) GeV there are 10.5 signal events and 245 events from the total background expected in the chosen side band.

The \(m_{\rm bb}\) spectrum (measured from the data as described in the previous section ) can then be normalized to contain \(N_{\rm Bkgtot}=N_{\rm sb}^{\rm t\bar{t}b\bar{b}}/\varepsilon_{\rm sb}^{\rm t\bar {t}jj}\) events, where \(N_{\rm sb}^{\rm t\bar{t}b\bar{b}}\) is the number of events in the side bands \(m_{\rm bb}<50\) GeV and \(m_{\rm bb}>250\) GeV in the \(\rm t\bar{t}b\bar{b}\) distribution, and \(\varepsilon_{\rm sb}^{\rm t\bar{t}jj}\) is the fraction of events in these side bands in the \(m_{\rm bb}\) mass spectrum obtained from the \(\rm t\bar{t}jj\) control sample.

The accuracy of the absolute normalization will be dominated by the statistical error of \(N_{\rm sb}\). From Monte Carlo simulation one expects \(N_{\rm sb}\) in the \(\rm t\bar{t}b\bar{b}\) sample in the order of 245 events for \({\cal L}=30\) fb\({}^{-1}\), and about 20 000 events in the side bands of the \(m_{\rm bb}\) mass spectrum of the \(\rm t\bar{t}jj\) control sample with \(\varepsilon_{\rm sb}=33\,\%\). This leads to a total statistical error of

\[\left(\frac{\Delta N}{N}\right)_{\rm stat.}\approx 6.5\,\%. \tag{4}\]

It was mentioned before that there is a small contribution from the signal process in the side band \(m_{\rm bb}<50\) GeV and \(m_{\rm bb}>250\) GeV. So the measured background cross section is systematically too high in the presence of the signal. For \(m_{\rm H}=120\) GeV this introduces a systematic uncertainty:

\[\left(\frac{\Delta N}{N}\right)_{\rm sys.}\approx 4\,\%. \tag{5}\]

### Conclusion on systematic uncertainties

In the beginning of data taking, the systematic uncertainties in the \(\rm t\bar{t}H\), \(\rm H\to b\bar{b}\) channel will be dominated completely by the imperfect knowledge of the \(\rm t\bar{t}\) +jets background. There are large uncertainties in the theoretical predictions from Monte Carlo generators as long as higher order calculations are not available. Therefore it is important to get an estimate of the background directly from the data. While this is straightforward for the normalization, some Monte Carlo information is still necessary for the determination of the shape. With the two methods described above it should be possible to measure the background to an accuracy of better than 10 % with 30 fb\({}^{-1}\).

In Table 16 we compare the expected significances with and without a systematic uncertainty of 10 % on the background in the improved analysis for \({\cal L}=30\) fb\({}^{-1}\). In this simple approach the background is just scaled by a factor 1.1. This reflects in a general decrease of the significances by about 5 %.

## 7 Conclusions and outlook

In this note the channel \(\mathrm{t}\overline{\mathrm{t}}\mathrm{H}\), \(\mathrm{H}\to\mathrm{b}\bar{\mathrm{b}}\) has been reinvestigated. With a more precise prediction of the irreducible background and updated cross sections for the signal and the background the significance of this channel is considerably smaller than the expectations in the tdr. Therefore an attempt was made to improve the reconstruction and analysis procedure, leading to a substantial enhancement in the expected significances. On average, the expected \(S/\sqrt{B}\) with the improved selection is \(43\,\%\) higher than with the tdr method. We summarize here the proposed improvements to achieve this enhancement

1. collinear approximation if equation for \(p_{\nu}^{z}\) can not be solved,
2. a likelihood for the jet pairing,
3. a final likelihood for events inside the \(m_{\mathrm{bb}}\) mass window.

The collinear approximation recovers \(25\,\%\) of the events, and the width of the reconstructed semileptonically decayed top quark increases by only \(0.5\,\,\mathrm{GeV}\). The pairing likelihood combines several kinematic variables into a single likelihood output. The jet combination with the highest likelihood is taken to be the correct combination. Instead of cutting on three masses \(m_{\mathrm{jj}}\), \(m_{\mathrm{jjb}}\), and \(m_{\ell\nu b}\) there is only one cut on the pairing likelihood to ensure that events with two top quarks are reconstructed. The efficiency for this cut is around \(95\,\%\), and the efficiency for a successful reconstruction of two top quarks and two remaining b-jets is augmented relatively by \(60\,\%\). It has been demonstrated that background processes not containing a pair of top quarks, like W+jets or single top events, are not dangerous as they have small likelihood values. In total the collinear approximation and the pairing likelihood lead to a worse mass resolution of the reconstructed top masses, decreasing from about \(8\,\,\mathrm{GeV}\) with the tdr reconstruction method to about \(10\,\,\mathrm{GeV}\). But the purity of correctly reconstructed events is even slightly better than with the tdr reconstruction, and the significance is increased by \(35\,\%\). The final likelihood explores differences between the signal and background process for events inside the \(m_{\mathrm{bb}}\) mass window around the expected Higgs mass. The efficiency of the cut on the final likelihood distribution is \(85\,\%\) for the signal and \(63\,\%\) for the background. The significance is increased by \(11\,\%\). The aforementioned numbers hold for \(m_{\mathrm{H}}=120\,\,\mathrm{GeV}\)

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{l c c c c c c c} \hline \hline \(m_{\mathrm{H}}\) (GeV) & \(80\) & \(90\) & \(100\) & \(110\) & \(120\) & \(130\) & \(140\) \\ \hline \(S/\sqrt{B}\) & \(7.4\) & \(6.0\) & \(4.8\) & \(3.8\) & \(2.8\) & \(1.9\) & \(1.0\) \\ Syst. \(S/\sqrt{B}\) & \(7.1\) & \(5.7\) & \(4.6\) & \(3.6\) & \(2.7\) & \(1.8\) & \(1.0\) \\ \hline \(\sigma_{\mathrm{Poisson}}\) & \(7.0\) & \(5.7\) & \(4.6\) & \(3.6\) & \(2.7\) & \(1.8\) & \(1.0\) \\ Syst. \(\sigma_{\mathrm{Poisson}}\) & \(6.7\) & \(5.4\) & \(4.4\) & \(3.5\) & \(2.6\) & \(1.7\) & \(0.9\) \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 16: Comparison of significances \(\mathrm{S}/\sqrt{B}\) and \(\sigma_{\mathrm{Poisson}}\) without systematic uncertainties and including a \(10\,\%\) systematic uncertainty on the background prediction. Results from the improved likelihood analysis are used for \(\mathcal{L}=30\,\,\mathrm{fb}^{-1}\).

We have proposed a method to extract the shape and normalization of the background from data with only little information from Monte Carlo simulations. With this procedure the background can possibly be described with an uncertainty of less than \(10\,\%\) with \(\mathcal{L}=30\) fb\({}^{-1}\).

This study is based on the fast simulation of the atlas detector, where quantities like energy and momentum resolutions and acceptances are parametrized, usually as functions of \(p_{T}\) or \(\eta\) of the particles and jets. For a validation of this parametrization for the Higgs boson search in the ttH channel it is necessary to perform a full simulation of the detector and to reconstruct the events with the algorithms that will be used with the real data.

One crucial aspect of the full simulation is to adjust the b-tagging parametrization, which is currently implemented in the atlasb routines, to the performance that can be reached with the current design of the detector. The layout, especially that of the Inner Detector, has undergone substantial changes since the tdr.

An investigation is necessary on the impact of degraded energy resolution and b-tagging performance which is expected for the pile-up environment in the high luminosity phase of the lhc.

These items are the subject of ongoing work and will be documented in a future note.
