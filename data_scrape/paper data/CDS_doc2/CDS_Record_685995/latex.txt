Radiation damage observed in the SVX and SVX\({}^{\prime}\) silicon vertex detectors in the CDF experiment at the Tevatron Collider at Fermilab provides an experimental measurement of the bulk radiation damage in silicon sensors versus sensor radius from the beam and delivered luminosity. These data are related to the effective particle fluences, for example in equivalent 1 MeV neutrons/cm\({}^{2}\), versus radius and luminosity. We scale the CDF results to the LHC to predict the fluences of radiation responsible for bulk damage in the pixel and silicon strip tracking systems in ATLAS. Thus this note provides an experimental cross check of the the Monte Carlo estimates of Gorfine and Taylor.

## 1 Introduction

Bulk radiation damage to silicon sensors results in changes in the effective silicon dopant concentration, \(N_{eff}\). Changes in \(N_{eff}\) are in turn related to changes in the sensor depletion voltage. The changes in \(N_{eff}\) depend on the magnitude and type of radiation fluence, \(\Phi\). Using estimates of the particle fluence [1, 2], depletion voltages can be predicted [3, 4-6, 15]. At some radii from the beam, the predicted depletion voltages become too large for efficient operation of the silicon sensors. Thus the particle fluences will limit the useful lifetime of silicon sensors. Thus it is important to cross check the estimated fluences versus LHC luminosity.

In addition to changing \(N_{eff}\) in silicon, the bulk radiation damage also changes the sensor leakage currents. For example for a microstrip sensor the leakage current per strip, \(I_{leak}\), is given by [7]:

\[I_{leak}(\Phi)=I_{leak}(0)+\alpha\cdot\Phi\cdot V_{strip} \tag{1}\]

where \(\alpha\) is the current related damage coefficient and \(V_{strip}\) is the charge collection volume per strip. Thus strip leakage currents provide a measurement of the bulk radiation fluence in a silicon sensor. Leakage currents have been measured in the SVX and SVX\({}^{\prime}\) silicon vertex detectors in the CDF experiment at the Tevatron Collider at Fermilab versus sensor radius from the beam and delivered luminosity [8]. Thus the CDF data provide an experimental measurement of the effective particle fluence versus radius and luminosity at \(\sqrt{s}=1.8\) TeV. These fluences are then scaled to LHC incorporating small corrections for changes of \(\sigma_{intastic}\) and \(dN/d\eta\) to \(\sqrt{s}=14\) TeV.

## 2 Reduction of CDF Data and Extrapolation to LHC

Strip leakage currents have been measured in the SVX and SVX\({}^{\prime}\) silicon vertex detectors in the CDF experiment at the Tevatron Collider at Fermilab versus sensor radius from the beam and delivered luminosity. For the innermost layer of SVX and SVX\({}^{\prime}\), located at a radius r=3.0cm from the beam, the measured values were \(I_{leak}^{SVX}=0.80nA/strip/pb^{-1}\) and \(I_{leak}^{SVX^{\prime}}=0.63nA/strip/pb^{-1}\) respectively [8]. The "per \(pb^{-1}\)" was the delivered luminosity at CDF. This luminosity had an uncertainty \(\pm 7\%\). The sensor temperatures were \(T=24\pm 2^{\circ}\)C. The leakage currents decreased with radius from the beam \(\propto r^{-1.68}\)[8]. It is important to note that the leakage currents reflected radiation damage from machine luminosity and from beam backgrounds in cluding higher than normal levels during machine _stores_ and _aborts_. Beam backgrounds relevant to the CDF SVX vertex detector were monitored continuously and minimized by the Tevatron operators. The SVX and SVX\({}^{\prime}\) leakage currents versus luminosity were from _good_ running periods. Beam backgrounds declined withtime and may explain the difference between the leakage current results for the initial SVX and the more recent SVX\({}^{\prime}\). Averaging the SVX and SVX\({}^{\prime}\) measurements and correcting to 20\({}^{\circ}\)C [7] we obtain:

\[I^{CDF}_{task}(T=20^{\circ}C,r)=0.50\pm 0.14\cdot(3.0cm/r)^{1.68}\ \ [nA/ strip/pb^{-1}]\]

where an overall uncertainty of 20% was ascribed to the average \(I^{CDF}_{task}(T=24^{\circ}C)\).

The sensor leakage current measurements are related to the equivalent particle fluence through the sensor as given in Eqn. 1 above. A frequently used standard is to convert to 1 MeV neutron equivalent where \(\alpha_{\infty}^{n}=2.86\pm 0.18\times 10^{-17}\)A/cm [9] corresponding to the current damage coefficient following complete annealing [1, 10]. For measurements before complete annealing, as represented by the CDF leakage current measurement versus accumulated luminosity, the effective current damage coefficient, \(\alpha_{effective}\), will be larger than \(\alpha_{\infty}\). This can be estimated assuming a constant \(d\Phi/dt\) and knowing the total running time. For CDF luminosities integrated over times \(\sim 10^{7}\) sec, then \(\alpha_{effective}\approx 1.1\pm 0.1\cdot\alpha_{\infty}\) based on a variety of annealing parameterizations [1, 10]. Thus we take \(\alpha_{effective}^{n}=3.15\pm 0.35\times 10^{-17}\ [A/cm]\).

The equivalent 1 MeV neutron fluence per \(pb^{-1}\) in CDF is then given by:

\[\Phi_{n}^{CDF}(r)=\frac{0.50\pm 0.14\times 10^{-9}\ [A/strip/pb^{-1}]}{3.15\pm 0.35\times 10^{-17}\ [A/cm]\cdot 4.59\times 10^{-3}\ [cm^{3}/strip]}\cdot(\frac{3.0\ [cm]}{r\ [cm]})^{1.68}\]

\[=3.5\pm 1.0\times 10^{1.2}\cdot(\frac{3.0\ [cm]}{r\ [cm]})^{1.68}\ \ [cm^{-2}/fb^{-1}]\]

where the fluence in the last line is now per \(fb^{-1}\).

To scale this to LHC we must correct for the difference between \(p\overline{p}\) interactions at \(\sqrt{s}=1.8\) TeV and \(pp\) interactions at \(\sqrt{s}=14\) TeV:

\[\Phi_{n}^{LHC}(r)=\Phi_{n}^{CDF}(r)\cdot f_{\sigma_{inelastic}}\cdot f_{dN/d \eta}\]

where \(f_{\sigma_{inelastic}}\) and \(f_{dN/d\eta}\) are multiplicative scale factors related to changes in \(\sigma_{inelastic}\) and \(dN/d\eta\) respectively. Corrections for differences in the magnetic field or in the tracking volume between CDF and ATLAS will have a small effect at the radii of the ATLAS pixel and inner silicon strip layers and are ignored.

The inelastic cross section is defined by:

\[\sigma_{inelastic}=\sigma_{total}-\sigma_{elastic}-\sigma_{low\ mass\ diff}\]where \(\sigma_{\it low\ mass\ diff}\) is the component of the diffractive cross section with a negligible contribution to central \(dN/d\eta\). Previous estimates were \(50\pm 2\)mb\(\,\)s at the Tevatron [11] and \(60\pm 10\%\) mbarns [1] at LHC giving a factor \(f_{\sigma_{\it inelastic}}=1.20\pm 0.13\) between the Tevatron and the LHC 1. Particle multiplicities at central rapidities are \(dN/d\eta\approx 4.3\pm 0.3\) at the Tevatron [14] and are estimated to be \(dN/d\eta\approx 5.5\pm 0.5\) at the LHC [1] giving a scale factor \(f_{dN/d\eta}=1.28\pm 0.15\)2.

Footnote 1: These estimates are consistent with current data [12, 13] taking \(\sigma_{\it elastic}/\sigma_{\it total}\approx 0.3\) at \(\sqrt{s}=14\) TeV and \(\sigma_{\it low\ mass\ diff}/\sigma_{\it elastic}\approx 1/3\) at both the Tevatron and the LHC.

Footnote 2: The uncertainty in this scale factor may be underestimated. For example the empirical dependence \(dN/d\eta(\eta=0)=2.5-0.25ln(s)+0.023ln^{2}(s)\), Ref. [14], predicts \(f_{dN/d\eta}=1.56\).

Thus the scaled \(\,\)l\(\,\) MeV neutron equivalent fluences at LHC are given by:

\[\Phi_{\mbox{\tiny n}}^{LHC}(r)=\Phi_{\mbox{\tiny n}}^{\it CDF}(r)\cdot(1.2\pm 0.13)\cdot(1.28\pm 0.15)\]

\[=5.3\pm 1.8\times 10^{12}\cdot(\frac{3.0\ [cm]}{r\ [cm]})^{1.68}\ \ [cm^{-2}/fb^{-1}]\]

Finally we evaluate this for an appropriate integrated luminosity at the LHC. For a luminosity of \(1\times 10^{34}\)cm\({}^{-2}\)sec\({}^{-1}\) and an effective time of \(1\times 10^{7}\) sec/year, ie \(100/\mbox{fb}^{-1}/\)year, then:

\[\Phi_{\mbox{\tiny n}}^{LHC}(r)=5.3\pm 1.8\times 10^{14}\cdot(\frac{3.0\ [cm]}{r\ [cm]})^{1.68}\ \ [cm^{-2}/year] \tag{2}\]

For an integrated luminosity of \(170/\mbox{fb}^{-1}/\)year as used in [1, 2] then:

\[\Phi_{\mbox{\tiny n}}^{LHC}(r)=9.1\pm 3.0\times 10^{14}\cdot(\frac{3.0\ [cm]}{r\ [cm]})^{1.68}\ \ [cm^{-2}/year] \tag{3}\]

This last result is compared with the Monte Carlo simulation results of Gorfine and Taylor [1, 2] in Fig. 1 and 2. The extrapolated CDF particle fluence results will be less reliable at large radii from the beam. This is seen in Fig. 1 and 2 where the Gorfine and Taylor results rise above the extrapolated CDF fluences at large radii. The majority of the difference at large radii comes from neutrons. The impressive agreement between Monte Carlo simulations and extrapolated data suggest that the fluence predictions are better than the usual _factor of 2_ in radiation damage estimates 3. Both the extrapolated CDF fluences, and the predictions of Gorfine and Taylor, will be altered if \(\sigma_{inelastic}\) and/or \(dN/d\eta\) at \(\sqrt{s}=14\) TeV are significantly different than in [1, 2].

Previous simulations of the depletion voltage of pixel and silicon microstrip sensors assumed a 10 year integrated fluence of 500MeV - 800MeV proton equivalent of \(6\times 10^{14}/\)cm\({}^{2}\) at a radius of 11.5cm and \(1\times 10^{14}/\)cm\({}^{2}\) at a radius of 30cm [4-6, 15]. Assuming an average integrated luminosity of 100/fb\({}^{-1}\)/year for 10 years (Eqn. 2), and scaling from 1 MeV neutron equivalent to 500MeV - 800MeV proton equivalent fluence 4 gives:

Footnote 4: The relative bulk radiation damage of 500MeV - 800MeV protons versus 1MeV neutrons is given by the ratio of the displacement cross sections, \(D(E)\), where \(D(E=500-800MeV\ p)/D(E=1MeV\ n)=1.13\pm 0.05\); see for example Ref. [9]. This is consistent with \(\alpha_{\rm 00}^{p}/\alpha_{\rm 00}^{n}=3.1\pm 0.6\times 10^{-2}/2.86\pm 0.18 \times 10^{-2}=1.08\pm 0.22\) [4-6, 9]; e.g. if we had used Eqn. 1 directly to evaluate the equivalent fluence of 500-800 MeV protons.

\[\Phi_{10years}^{p}(r=11.5cm)=5.0\pm 1.7\times 10^{14}/cm^{2}\]

and

\[\Phi_{10years}^{p}(r=30cm)=1.0\pm 0.33\times 10^{14}/cm^{2}\]

consistent with the previous simulation studies [4-6, 15]. These numbers are low by a factor of 1.7 if the average yearly luminosity of 170/fb\({}^{-1}\) is assumed (ie Eqn. 3). An increase of 1.7\(\times\) in integrated luminosity would make a major change in the predictions of silicon depletion voltages with time 5.

Footnote 5: A flavor of this is provided by the silicon depletion voltage predictions in Ref. [4, 5] that assumed \(\pi^{+}\) bulk damage coefficients. Those predictions increased the \(\Phi_{10years}^{p}\) by a factor of 1.44 (the ratio of 300 MeV \(\pi^{+}\) and 550MeV - 800 MeV _proton_ damage coefficients). Thus the “\(\pi^{+}\)” predictions in Ref. [4, 5] are part way to the assumption of an average yearly luminosity of 170/fb\({}^{-1}\).

## 3 Summary

Extrapolation of measured CDF particle fluences to LHC are found to be in excellent agreement with the Monte Carlo predictions of Gorfine and Taylor [1, 2]. The impressive agreement between Monte Carlo simulations and extrapolated data suggest that the fluence predictions are better than the usual _factor of 2_ in radiation damage estimates. Both the extrapolated CDF fluences, and the predictions of Gorfine and Taylor, will be altered if \(\sigma_{inelastic}\) and/or \(dN/d\eta\) at \(\sqrt{s}=14\) TeV are significantly different than in [1, 2].

Previous simulations of the depletion voltage of pixel and silicon microstrip sensors, assuming a 10 year integrated fluence of 500MeV - 800MeV proton equivalent of \(6\times 10^{14}/\)cm\({}^{2}\) at a radius of 11.5cm and \(1\times 10^{14}/\)cm\({}^{2}\) at a radius of 30cm [4-6, 15], are in good agreement with the extrapolated CDF fluences for an integratedluminosity of 100/fb\({}^{-1}\)/year for 10 years. The depletion voltage simulations will be underestimated if the LHC integrated luminosity is 170/fb\({}^{-1}\)/year for 10 years.
