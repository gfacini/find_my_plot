**Abstract**

In the absence of a light Higgs boson, the mechanism of electroweak symmetry breaking will be best studied in processes of vector boson scattering at high mass. Various models predict resonances in this channel. Here, we investigate \(WW\)scalar and vector resonances, \(WZ\) vector resonances and a \(ZZ\) scalar resonance over a range of diboson centre-of-mass energies. Particular attention is paid to the application of forward jet tagging and to the reconstruction of dijet pairs with low opening angle resulting from the decay of highly boosted vector bosons. The performances of different jet algorithms are compared. We find that resonances in vector boson scattering can be discovered with a few tens of inverse femtobarns of integrated luminosity.

Introduction

In the absence of a light Higgs boson, an alternative scenario to the Standard Model, Supersymmetry, or Little Higgs models must be invoked. In particular, Electroweak Symmetry Breaking (EWSB) could result from a strong coupling interaction. Here, we will make no assumptions about the underlying dynamics of EWSB; we treat the Standard Model as a low energy effective theory, and evaluate the potential for measuring vector boson scattering. In the Standard Model, perturbative unitarity is violated [1] in vector boson scattering at high energy for a Higgs mass \(m_{H}>870\) GeV or, if there is no Higgs (\(m_{H}\to\infty\)), for a centre-of-mass energy above a critical value of around 1.7 TeV. The only way to avoid a light Higgs boson is therefore to presume new physics at high energy [2], possibly in the form of vector boson pair resonances. Such resonances are predicted in many models such as QCD-like technicolour models with the required Goldstone bosons resulting from chiral symmetry breaking [3]; Higgsless extra dimension models [4], where Kaluza-Klein states of gauge bosons are exchanged in the \(s\)-channel [5]; as well as in models with extra vector bosons, from GUT or from strong interaction (BESS models [6]) mixing with the Standard Model vector bosons. The present search for resonances in vector boson scattering can be considered generic and may be interpreted in terms of any of these models.

### The Chiral Lagrangian Model

The Chiral Lagrangian (ChL) model is an effective theory valid up to \(4\pi v\sim 3\) TeV, where \(v=246\) GeV is the vacuum expectation value of the Standard Model Higgs field. It can provide a description of longitudinal gauge boson scattering at the TeV scale when no light scalar Higgs boson is present. Electroweak symmetry breaking is realised non-linearly. A set of dimension-4 effective operators describe the low energy interactions (see for example [7]). Since, at the LHC, vector boson scattering can occur at the TeV energy scale where the interaction becomes strong, it is necessary to unitarise the scattering amplitudes. One popular unitarisation prescription is the so-called Pade prescription, or Inverse Amplitude Method [8]. This is based on meson scattering in QCD, where it gives an excellent description [9], reproducing observed resonances. Among the terms of the Lagrangian which describe vector boson scattering, under some basic assumptions (custodial symmetry and CP conservation), only 2 parameters (namely \(\alpha_{4}\) and \(\alpha_{5}\)) are important for this process. Depending on the values of these two parameters, one can obtain Higgs-like scalar resonances and/or technicolour-like vector resonances [10]. The resulting properly-unitarised amplitudes for vector boson scattering may therefore give information in a higher energy range. They yield poles for certain values of \(\alpha_{4}\) and \(\alpha_{5}\) that can be interpreted as resonances, as shown in Fig. 1. The hashed region in the figure is forbidden by causality arguments [11].

Other unitarisation procedures are possible, such as the K-matrix method [12] or the \(N/D\) method [13]. In general, resonances are not necessarily produced. In non-resonant cases, it remains vital to measure the vector boson scattering cross section, but high luminosity and a very good understanding of backgrounds will be required in order to measure the regularisation of the cross section.

### Characteristic Signatures of Vector Boson Scattering

Discovery of the physics signals studied here will, in general, require high integrated luminosity. It will require also extremely large samples of simulated backgrounds, fine tuning of all reconstruction algorithms, and a good understanding of the detector performance, which will only gradually develop after the first few years of LHC running. The main purpose of this note is not, therefore, to evaluate with precision the discovery potential of ChL resonances, but to establish a strategy for the search of this important signal. The main emphasis will be put on those aspects most particular to the high mass vector boson scattering process; that is, the reconstruction of hadronically decaying vector bosons at high \(p_{T}\) and the reconstruction of the high rapidity tag jets.

The decay of a high mass ChL resonance will produce two highly boosted vector bosons in the central rapidity region of the detector. For transverse momenta greater than about 250 GeV, a hadronically decaying vector boson will be seen as one single wide and heavy jet. Methods of distinguishing such jets from single-parton jets will be investigated with different jet algorithms.

A characteristic signature of vector boson scattering is the presence of two high rapidity and high energy "tag" jets [14], arising from the quarks which radiate the incoming vector bosons. The process can thus be efficiently distinguished from contributions to the production of (mostly transversely polarised) final state vector bosons due to bremsstrahlung of these vector bosons from the quarks. In that case, the accompanying jets are softer and more central. A further component of the signature is the suppression of QCD radiation in the rapidity interval between the tag jets due to the fact that no colour is exchanged between the protons in these processes [15]. This characteristic feature allows for efficient use of central jet veto to suppress backgrounds.

The high QCD background at the LHC naturally leads us to focus on "semi-leptonic" vector boson events; that is, those events when one \(W\) or \(Z\) boson decays leptonically, and the other decays hadronically. These channels represent the best compromise in that there is only at most one neutrino, so the diboson mass may be reconstructed with reasonable resolution, and the backgrounds can be reduced to a manageable level by the requirement of leptons and/or missing transverse energy (\(\not{E}_{T}\)). Fully-leptonic events are also useful in cases where clear resonances are present, where a kinematic edge may be visible and the backgrounds may be reduced even further. The case of resonant \(ZZ\to\ell^{+}\ell^{-}\nu\bar{\nu}\) can also lead to a clean signature. Fully hadronic events may be useable at very high diboson energies, but this possibility is not considered further here. Thus, the study of vector boson scattering events will also require a good understanding of detector performance for electrons, muons and \(\not{E}_{T}\). Although many ATLAS analyses will depend on the reconstruction of these objects, the quality of such reconstruction is evaluated here for the case of high energy leptons.

The note is organised as follows. In the next section (2) we describe the Monte Carlo simulations and the samples used. Next, the trigger is discussed (Section 3), then the detector performance with particular focus on the challenges of this analysis (Section 4). After this, the event selections, efficiencies and purities for the various final states are given (Section 5). An attempt to evaluate the expected sensitivity is made (Section 6), and the systematic uncertainties are discussed (Section 7), before a final summary and conclusion.

Signals and Background Simulation

### Definition of Signal

In order to have a gauge invariant set of diagrams for the background, in spite of a Higgsless scenario, a low mass Higgs will be assumed. A resonance _signal_ will be defined here as an excess of events in the resonance mass region over the number expected from the Standard Model continuum when the Higgs boson mass is set at 100 GeV. This ensures that longitudinal vector boson scattering will contribute negligibly to the process. This definition follows the prescription of [16]. We note that measurement of even a continuum cross section for this process at such high energies would be of great importance, but will not be considered here as it should require high luminosity and a very good understanding of backgrounds.

### Overview of Generators

The Monte Carlo (MC) generators used in the main analysis are as follows.

* Pythia[17] version 6.4.0.3 was used for the signal, with the CTEQ6L parton distribution function and the renormalisation and factorisation scale \(Q^{2}=m_{W}^{2}\). The hard process was modified to include new vector boson scattering amplitudes (see below).
* MadGraph[18], version 3.95, with Pythia for parton shower, hadronisation and underlying event, was used for \(W\)+jets and \(Z\)+jets backgrounds. The default values of fixed renormalisation and factorisation scales of \(Q^{2}=m_{Z}^{2}\) were set and CTEQ6L1 parton distribution functions were used.
* MC@NLO[19], with Herwig[20], for parton shower and hadronisation and Jimmy[21, 22] for underlying event, was used for \(t\bar{t}\) background.

The underlying event samples were tuned to data from previous experiments [22]. All samples use Photos[23] to simulate final state radiation. Whizard[24] and Alpgen[25, 26] are also used for some generator level comparisons. Whizard uses Pythia for parton showering, hadronisation, and underlying event. Alpgen uses Herwig/Jimmy.

The different choice of scales for MadGraph and Pythia is not ideal, but retained for historical reasons since large samples were generated with these choices. However, studies showed that the major effect is on the cross section rather than on event shapes, and the cross section normalisation is determined independently as described below.

Further details specific to the samples are given below.

### List of samples

Table 1 lists the Monte Carlo samples, produced with full detector simulation, used in the present analysis.

The first set of samples represents different reference cases of vector boson scattering signals:

* Pythia-73: For the samples labelled "Pythia-73", the process 73 (longitudinal \(WZ\) scattering) was selected, with MSTP(46)=5 (QCD-like model of [27] with Pade unitarisation). All other switches were left as default. This is meant to represent a generic narrow \(WZ\) resonance.
* Pythia-ChL: datasets with generator labelled "Pythia-ChL" in the table use a modified version of Pythia routine PYSGHG. The modification involves replacing the scattering amplitudes calculated for processes 73-77 by those given by Dobado et al [10] with parameters \(a_{4}\) and \(a_{5}\). These

\end{table}
Table 1: Data samples and generators used in the present studyparameters were chosen so as to produce a vector or scalar (indicated by a (v) or an (s) in the table) resonance at the desired mass, or signal with no resonances at all. Note that only vector \(WZ\) and scalar \(ZZ\) resonances are possible, but both scalar and vector \(WW\) resonances can be produced. A continuum sample was also generated using this model.

Background samples include events with two vector bosons and two jets in the final state, arising from gluon or electroweak vector boson exchange between incoming quarks. The vector bosons are here mostly transverse and emitted more centrally than in the case of longitudinal vector boson pair scattering.

* \(jjWZ\) final state, where \(j\) is a quark or gluon: The decays of the vector bosons are performed in Pythia. Note that the semi-leptonic cases are already included in samples \(W\)+jets and \(Z\)+ jets (see below). Only the purely leptonic cases make use of this background.
* The background process: \(\ell\ell\nu\nu\) with a pair of jets (quark or gluons). The cross section shown in Table 1 is for non-hadronic decay of the \(ZZ\)'s, with a filter requiring two leptons with \(p_{T}>5\) GeV and \(|\eta|<2.8\).
* \(W/Z+3\) jets and \(W/Z+4\) jets: they constitute backgrounds for the cases of high mass and lower mass resonances respectively since, in the former case, we expect that most of the vector bosons which decay hadronically will be reconstructed as a single jet. A correction factor of 1.38 is applied to the \(W^{+}\)+jets cross sections to account for the \(W^{-}\)+j process. These datasets include all tree level diagrams leading to \(W\)+4j, \(Z\)+4j, \(W\)+3j and \(Z\)+3j, with the vector bosons decaying leptonically, including all QCD and electroweak contributions. To keep the cross section manageable, preselection cuts were applied at MadGraph level. For the \(W,Z+4\) jets case, we tag the highest rapidity jet (fjet), backward jet (bjet) and 2 central jets by requiring that \(|\eta_{fjet}|>1.5\), \(|\eta_{bjet}|>1.5\), that the forward and backward jet candidates be on different hemispheres: \(\eta_{fjet}\eta_{bjet}<0\), that at least one forward jet have energy \(E>300\) GeV, and that the invariant mass of the combined forward jets be \(m_{jj}>250\) GeV. We further require \(p_{T}\) of at least one of the central jets to be \(p_{T}{}^{j}>50\) GeV, the \(p_{T}\) of the vectorial addition of the central jets to be \(p_{T}{}^{jj}>60\) GeV and the invariant mass of the combined central jets \(m_{jj}>60\) GeV. We note that the forward jet preselection suppresses this background by a factor of 3.5. For the case \(W,Z+3\) jets, we add the requirements: \(p_{T}\) of the \(W\) or \(Z\) boson \(p_{T}>200\) GeV, \(|\eta_{W/Z}|<2\), and \(p_{T}\) of one jet (central) \(p_{T}{}^{j}>200\)GeV, \(|\eta_{j}|<2\).

Additional samples were produced with fast detector simulation to improve background statistics.

### Comparative studies of generators

#### 2.4.1 Parton shower matching to matrix elements

Here, MadGraph was used to generate the \(W\)+jets background. A better evaluation of this background would be obtained using a generator for which \(W\)+n partons, n=0, 1, 2, 3 or 4 inclusive, are combined in a manner which avoids double counting of jets produced by the parton shower in Pythia. Alpgen is one such generator (and in fact such matching is now implemented in more recent versions of MadGraph). However, due to time constraints, and in order to have a manageable size of background samples, it was not practical to use this technique. In order to validate the use of MadGraph, a comparison was made of the \(W+4\)jets sample with an appropriate Alpgen sample, with same analysis cuts applied. The Alpgen samples are not used in the final analysis since they lack sufficient statistics.

Distributions of the vector bosons and jets were compared. As an example, the distributions for the forward jets are shown in Fig. 2. The overall conclusion is that the shapes of the distributions are in reasonable agreement. Therefore, neglecting the effect of parton shower double counting does not significantly affect the event topology. To the extent that such an error is made, the tag jets in the Alpgen sample have a lower energy (leading to a depletion with respect to the MadGraph samples at high energies of a few %) and so the backgrounds in this analysis can be considered to be conservatively overestimated. The sensitivity of such backgrounds to the scales has been discussed, for example, in [28, 29]. The difference in \(Q^{2}\) scale of the two samples (Alpgen uses \(Q^{2}=m_{W}^{2}+p_{T}(W)^{2}\)) leads to about a factor two discrepancy in cross section. This was confirmed by running MadGraph on a small sample with the same scale as Alpgen, yielding cross sections smaller by factors 2.05 and 1.77 for the QCD and QED processes respectively. These factors will be applied in the present analysis.

#### 2.4.2 Effective \(W\) Approximation

Whizard[24] is a relatively new event generator originally developed for the ILC. It is able to calculate the full \(2\to 6\) matrix element needed for the vector boson scattering processes and it implements the Chiral Lagrangian model with the K-Matrix unitarisation scheme [27] which does not lead to vector boson resonances. Further unitarisation schemes in the form of arbitrary resonances are planned.

The generator does not assume an effective \(W\) approximation, whereby the bosons emitted from the quarks are treated as partons, allowing vector boson scattering diagrams to form a gauge-invariant subset. This approximation is made in the Pythia signal samples, and might be expected to particularly affect the tag jet kinematics. Comparisons between the tag jet distributions from Whizard and Pythia are shown in Fig. 3. The two samples are not strictly comparable since here, Whizard simulates the \(2\to 4\) processes including non-scattering electroweak diagrams and applies K-matrix unitarisation. Although there are differences (e.g. the tag jets from Whizard are somewhat harder than those from Pythia) they do not strongly depend upon the vector boson centre-of-mass, and thus the effective \(W\) approximation is unlikely to be the culprit. The harder tag jets in Whizard mean that if the signal looks

more like Whizard than Pythia, it would be more likely to pass the selection cuts, thus improving the sensitivity. The potential size of the effect was investigated and estimated to be at the few per cent level.

## 3 Trigger

As a first step in the analysis, it is important to evaluate the efficiency of the basic trigger menus for a luminosity of \(10^{33}\) cm\({}^{-2}\)s\({}^{-1}\). The triggers chosen were based on an early menu [30] as an example, and the real physics menu is likely to be very different. However, since the signal is at relatively high \(p_{T}\), and triggering on vector bosons is a high priority, this is not likely to have a large impact. To evaluate this efficiency, we apply the following cuts: for electrons and muons we require single leptons to have \(p_{T}\) greater than the value corresponding to the threshold dictated by the trigger signature and \(|\eta|<2.5\); similarly for jets, but with a pseudorapidity cut of \(|\eta|<3.2\). This is necessary because trigger signatures for forward jets exist separately, but unfortunately that trigger information was not available in the simulation version used for this study. The trigger efficiency is defined as the number of times the trigger passed (with the corresponding cuts applied) divided by the number of truth events in the samples (with the same cuts applied). In Table 2 we present a detailed list of efficiencies for the signals \(qqWZ\to qqjj\ell\ell\) (\(m=1.1\) TeV) in the left column and \(qqWW\to qqjj\ell\nu\) (non-resonant) in the right2).

Figure 3: Differences between Whizard (red) and Pythia (black) for vanishing anomalous couplings for tag jet distributions of: transverse momentum (a), pseudo rapidity (b), energy (c) and pseudo rapidity difference (d).

The poor efficiency of the e25i (see Fig. 4, left) and 2e12i triggers is understood to be due to the isolation criterion, which was not optimised for high energy electrons.

It is worth mentioning that the efficiency for the 2j120 trigger (Fig. 4, right), which requires two jets with \(p_{T}>120\) GeV suffers partly from the fact that the two jets from the vector boson decay are merged due to the boost as described in Section 4.1. It is also significantly higher for events with true electrons than for those with true muons, probably because the electrons themselves are also reconstructed as jets in the calorimeter.

Finally, various combinations of the trigger signatures might be explored in the future to improve the efficiency. For instance, the e60 trigger might be used in conjunction with the e25i to compensate the low efficiency of the latter for high-momentum electrons (Fig. 4). Likewise, the 2j120 trigger might be used together with j160, since the efficiency of the latter drops significantly when the hadronically

The ‚ÄúCut Loss‚Äù columns indicate the fraction of true events that would be lost by applying the \(p_{T}\) requirements of each trigger signature on the true electrons, muons and jets. Since such events are unlikely to satisfy the trigger conditions, they are not taken into account when the trigger efficiencies are evaluated.

decaying vector boson has \(p_{T}<300\) GeV and decays into two distinctly resolvable jets.

## 4 Reconstruction Challenges

In this section, we focus on those parts of the reconstruction which are most particular to vector boson fusion at high masses. We discuss the following:

* Reconstruction of hadronically-decaying vector bosons. In our regime these typically have high \(p_{T}\) and the decay products are very collimated. We discuss two alternative methods, using \(k_{\perp}\) jets and subjets, and using cone jets with different radii.
* Leptonically decaying vector bosons. These require good lepton and \(\not{E}_{T}\) measurement, but the challenges here are not unique to these channels.
* Forward 'tag' jets. Measuring jets close to the edge of the detector rapidity acceptance is a challenge in common with low mass Higgs searches in vector boson fusion.
* Central jet veto. Since the vector boson scattering process involves no colour exchange between the protons, a suppression of QCD radiation is expected. This can be used to distinguish between signal and background, but is sensitive to underlying event and pile-up.
* Top veto. \(t\bar{t}\) production is a major background for the channels which do not contain leptonic \(Z\) boson decays. A large fraction of this is removed by explicitly rejecting events containing top candidates.

### Hadronic Vector Boson Identification

At lower masses and \(p_{T}\), the hadronically-decaying vector bosons are identified as dijet pairs. However, for events where a hadronically-decaying vector boson is highly boosted, the decay products are often collimated into a single jet. Cuts such as a dijet invariant mass window are no longer applicable in this scenario, but a single jet mass cut can be used.

The single jet mass is defined as the invariant mass evaluated from the 4-vectors of the constituents of the jet. In the ATLAS detector, these constituents are at present calorimeter objects, either topologically defined clusters with some local hadronic calibration, called here _topoclusters_, or calorimeter towers. For jets containing the decay products of a boosted vector boson, this single jet mass is near the mass of the parent boson. For light quark and gluon jets this mass is generally much lower. Since the background to hadronic vector boson identification is so severe, further cuts may be applied on the subjet structure of the candidate jet.

In addition, the transition between the dijet and single jet case as \(p_{T}\) increases needs to be dealt with. Two methods are used, as follows;

1. Dynamically select the appropriate method. To do this, we first look at the highest \(p_{T}\) jet. If this passes the mass window cut, then the single jet selection is applied, as described below. If it does not, then combinations of jet pairs in the event are considered. The vector boson is still expected to be the highest \(p_{T}\) hadronic system, and so the \(p_{T}\) of all jet pairs is evaluated, and the highest \(p_{T}\) pair is taken to be the vector boson candidate. A mass window cut (dependent upon the jet algorithm) is then applied to this pair. Thus a single analysis can be used to scan the data for signs of resonances without bias.

2. When the single jet and jet pair cases yield very different signal to background ratios, it is preferable to choose a priori which mass region is being investigated, and to use the single jet reconstruction for high masses and the dijet reconstruction for low masses. This approach is used in the cone algorithm analysis. For the \(m=800\) GeV resonance, both the dijet and single jet approaches are tried independently.

#### 4.1.1 \(K_{\perp}\) Algorithm

The \(k_{\perp}\) algorithm is run with an \(R\)-parameter (which determines the "jet size") of 0.6 on calibrated topoclusters. The algorithm [31] merges pairs of constituents.

The \(k_{\perp}\) analysis uses the dynamic selection technique described above to decide whether to use a dijet or a single jet for the vector boson candidate. The fraction of vector bosons reconstructed as a single jet, as a function of \(p_{T}\) of the vector boson candidate, is given in Fig. 5. The transition between dijet and single jet takes place between \(p_{T}=200\) and 300 GeV for this algorithm.

#### Single jet mode

The resolution of the single jet mass for the \(k_{\perp}\) algorithm has been evaluated for both detector simulations (full and fast) for several samples. For the sample with a \(WW\) resonance at \(m=1.1\) TeV (Fig. 6 left) for example, the \(W\) boson singlet jet mass resolution was found to be \(7.4\pm 0.2\%\) GeV from full and fast detector simulation.

A mass cut around the window from \(m=68.4\) GeV to 97.2 GeV is applied to \(W\) boson candidates, and from \(m=68.7\) GeV to 106.3 GeV for hadronic \(Z\) boson candidates reconstructed in the single jet mode. These mass windows are determined by considering the resolution, the tails, and the background contamination.

The \(k_{\perp}\) merging is intrinsically ordered in scale, making the final merging the hardest. The algorithm provides a \(y\) value for this final merging, which is a measure of the highest scale at which a jet can be resolved into two subjets. The \(y\) value can be converted into a "Y scale" in GeV using the relation Y scale \(=E_{T}\times\sqrt{y}\), where \(E_{T}\) is the jet transverse energy. This Y scale is expected to be \({\cal O}(m_{V}/2)\) (where \(m_{V}\) is the mass of the vector boson) for boosted vector boson jets, and much lower than \(E_{T}\) for light jets [32]. At the truth and fast simulation levels this variable has been shown to have discriminating power even after a single jet mass cut [32, 33, 34, 35]. The resolution of the ATLAS detector for this variable is presented in

Figure 5: Fraction of \(W\) boson candidates reconstructed from a single jet, as a function of the transverse momentum of the reconstructed vector boson, for the \(WW\)\(m=1.1\) TeV signal sample.

Fig. 6 (right). The resolutions, for the same sample as above, are \(12.3\pm 0.3\%\) and \(8.8\pm 0.2\%\) with full and fast detector simulation, respectively.

Based on the resolution, the tails, and the background contamination, a Y scale cut around the window from 30 GeV to 100 GeV is applied to \(W\) and \(Z\) boson candidates reconstructed in the single jet mode. To evaluate the benefit of cutting on Y scale, a sample of single jet vector boson candidates is selected in signal and background by applying a \(p_{T}>300\) GeV cut, motivated by Fig. 5, and a mass window cut. Starting from this sample, the efficiency of the Y scale cut is given in Table 3 for full and fast simulation. The numbers suggest that for the \(W\)+jets background, an additional rejection factor of approximately 2 is provided by the Y scale cut even after a single jet mass cut has been applied. This is achieved with a signal efficiency of approximately 80%.

#### Dijet mode

A mass cut around the window from \(m=62\) GeV to 94 GeV is applied to \(W\) boson candidates, and from \(m=66.6\) GeV to 106.2 GeV for hadronic \(Z\) boson candidates reconstructed in the dijet mode.

A variable analogous to the \(y\) may be calculated, using the \(p_{T}\) of the softer jet relative to the harder one. This variable is required to be in the range \(0.1<\sqrt{y}<0.45\). The efficiency is shown in Table 4.

The mass and \(y\) windows are again determined by considering the resolution, the tails, and the background contamination.

The resolutions of the dijet mass and the \(y\) variable for dijet vector boson candidates are shown in Fig. 7. They are found to be approximately 5% for the mass and for the \(y\) variable, and are comparable in fast and full simulation.

#### 4.1.2 Cone Algorithm

The problem of the two jets from a boosted hadronically decaying vector boson merging into a single jet has also been studied for jets reconstructed using the Cone Algorithm. With this algorithm, jet reconstruction starts from _seeds_ i.e. constituents (clusters) with \(p_{T}>1\) GeV. The algorithm collects all constituents around a seed within \(\Delta R=\sqrt{(\Delta\eta)^{2}+\Delta\phi)^{2}}<R_{0}\) (where \(R_{0}\) can be, for instance 0.4) and adds their momenta vectorially. Then it repeats the procedure over the collection around the direction of the sum, and computes a new sum. It continues repeating this operation until the resulting sum direction is stable.

Single jet hadronic \(W\) boson candidates are identified with the highest \(p_{T}\) object in the central region, after having removed overlaps with all electrons in the event within a \(\Delta R\) of 0.1. A mass cut in a window around the reconstructed \(W\) boson mass is applied.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|c|} \hline  & 800 GeV Scalar Resonance & \(W\)+4 jets & \(t\bar{t}\) \\ \hline Jet Mass & 17\% (20\%) & 6\% ( 7\%) & 14\% (14\%) \\ \hline Y Scale & 79\% (83\%) & 48\% (49\%) & 84\% (82\%) \\ \hline \end{tabular}

Figure 8 shows an example of \(W\) boson reconstruction using the cone algorithm for the jet-pair case (\(m=500\) GeV resonance) and single jet case (\(m=800\) GeV resonance). A cone size of 0.8 is used for selecting a single jet \(W\) boson and 0.4 for the case of a jet pair. The low mass tail is due to events where the two jets from the \(W\) are well separated. There is a small difference in the \(W\) boson mass peak reconstruction for the two cases. The jets chosen for this selection have a minimum \(p_{T}\) cut of 20 GeV, and those overlapping with electrons have been removed.

The exploration of the substructure of a wide jet (typically of size 0.8) is done by searching for 2 narrow jets (size \(\sim 0.2\)) fitting inside the big jet. Various variables can then be studied, among which are the energy ratio of the narrow jets, their invariant mass, the distance \(\Delta R\) between the leading narrow jet and the wide jet, or the momentum component of this narrow jet transverse to the wide jet direction. The discriminating power is illustrated for the \(WZ\to\ell\ell jj\) channel (1.1 TeV resonance) and its principal background in Fig. 9 which shows the latter variable (called here 'p transverse') versus the invariant mass reconstructed from two narrow jets. Cutting in the (\(p_{T}\), invariant mass) plane gives results comparable to those obtained with the Y scale method above, as illustrated in Table 5. Similarly, Fig. 10 shows the \(p_{T}\) versus \(\Delta R\) between the leading narrow jet and the wide jet.

### Leptonic Vector Boson Identification

#### 4.2.1 Lepton Reconstruction Efficiencies

All the signals studied in this note involve at least one leptonic vector boson decay. Electrons and muons are selected using standard ATLAS criteria [36, 37] for the case of a resonance \(m(WZ)\) of 800 MeV. Figure 11 shows the efficiency for \(W\) boson daughter leptons, where the trigger position has not been applied. The results for different electron selection criteria are given. The loss of efficiency occurs in the

\end{table}
Table 5: Comparison of efficiencies for the jet sub-structure selection for a typical signal and backgrounds. Efficiencies are relative to the selection of a single jet as described in the Y scale method (Table 3). For the subjet selection, we require 2 small jets with \(p_{T}>15\) GeV and invariant mass \(>60\) GeV (see text).

Lower graph : normalized distributions of narrow jet orthogonal momentum.

forward regions, near the limits of the tracking detectors and at \(p_{T}\) values close to the applied cut. The efficiencies for the leptonic \(Z\) boson channels have been found to be similar.

#### 4.2.2 Leptonic \(Z\) Boson Reconstruction

The \(Z\) boson candidates are reconstructed from pairs of \(e^{+}e^{-}\) or \(\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\). In the electron case, the mass resolution is about 2.7 GeV as is shown in Fig. 12 left, suggesting a mass window selection between \(m=85\) GeV and 97 GeV for \(m_{ee}\). In the case of muons, the resolution for the \(Z\) mass reconstruction is 3.6 GeV (see Fig. 12 right), so the mass requirement is loosened to be between \(m=83\) GeV and 99 GeV. Furthermore, to reduce the backgrounds (particularly the background from \(t\bar{t}\) events), the \(p_{T}\) of one of the leptons is required to be \(p_{T}>50\) GeV, and that of the other \(p_{T}>35\) GeV. In the unlikely case that more than one combination of leptons satisfy all these requirements, we choose the composite \(Z_{\ell^{+}\ell^{-}}\) with the mass closest to the actual \(Z\) boson mass.

#### 4.2.3 Leptonic \(W\) Boson Reconstruction

For the signal, after reconstruction of the hadronic vector boson candidate, the highest \(p_{T}\) lepton corresponds to the lepton from the \(W\) boson decay in 96% of cases. Attributing the missing momentum to the neutrino, and taking the nominal \(W\) boson mass (\(m_{W}=80.42\) GeV) as a constraint, a quadratic equation is obtained for the \(z\)-component of the neutrino's momentum. The \(z\) component is required in order to reconstruct the diboson mass in the final analysis. Only events for which at least one real solution exists for this quadratic equation are retained. When there are two possible solutions, one is chosen at random

The electron plots show the efficiency for 4 different electron selection criteria: All candidate objects (green), _loose_ (black circles), _medium_ (red squares), and _tight_ (blue triangles).

to avoid kinematic bias on the resonance mass. Options such as selecting the reconstructed \(W\) boson which is more central have also been considered, and little difference was found in the purity of the reconstruction. In the fully leptonic case, the leptonic \(Z\) boson is reconstructed and its daughter leptons removed before applying the above procedure.

### Tagged Forward Jets

One of the well known characteristic features of vector boson scattering is the presence of high energy forward jets [14], resulting from the primary quarks from which the vector bosons have radiated (see Fig. 13). Such forward jets are expected to be much less prominent in processes involving gluon or electroweak boson exchange with bremsstrahlung of vector bosons. In the latter case, these vector bosons are mostly transverse and have a harder \(p_{T}\) spectrum than in \(W_{L}W_{L}\) scattering. Correspondingly, the outgoing primary quarks have a harder \(p_{T}\) and are therefore less forward.

Many different strategies are possible for implementing a tag-jet selection. A number of these were compared, and the best rejection factors for a given efficiency were obtained as follows:

1. Require two jets with * \(|\eta(jet)|>\eta_{\text{cut}}\) and \(p_{T}(jet)>p_{T\text{cut}}\) * opposite signed rapidity * at least one of them has an energy greater than a critical value \(E_{\text{cut}}\)
2. If more than one jet with the same sign rapidity satisfies the above cuts, choose the most energetic, labelled FJ1. The next one is labelled FJ2. * Require the tag-jet with the opposite sign of rapidity to satisfy \(\Delta\eta(FJ1,FJ2)>\Delta\eta_{\text{cut}}\) and \(E(FJ2)>E_{\text{2cut}}\)

In addition a dijet mass cut is currently applied in the cone algorithm analyses. The specific values of the cuts in each case are to be optimised depending upon the kinematic region under study.

Figure 12: Reconstructed \(Z\) boson from electron pairs (left) and muon pairs (right).

### Central Jet Veto

A useful analysis strategy to suppress backgrounds such as \(t\bar{t}\) is to apply a central jet veto [38, 39, 15]. For vector boson scattering, one expects little QCD radiation in the central region since only colourless electroweak vector bosons are produced and the forward jets are not colour connected. Given the forward jet cut definition, we unambiguously define the central region of the event as the \(\eta\) region between them. The central jet veto then simply requires that no other high \(p_{T}\) jet (here taken as \(p_{T}>30\) GeV) other than those resulting from the hadronically decaying vector boson lie in the central region.

Specifically, in the analyses where it is applied, the central jet veto rejects events if there are any additional jets with a chosen maximum value for \(|\eta|\) and minimum value for \(p_{T}\).

### Top Quark Rejection

While the final states from a leptonically decaying \(Z\) boson are mostly free of background from top processes, \(t\bar{t}\) and \(tW\) events form an important source of background for the \(WW\) signals. To suppress them, events can be vetoed if a reconstructed \(W\) boson candidate, combined with another jet in the event (excluding those overlapping with an identified electron or within \(\Delta R<0.8\) of a \(W\) candidate), leads to an invariant mass close to that of the top quark [32]. A typical mass window is \(130<m_{t}<240\) GeV.

In a future analysis it is likely that this cut can be improved using \(b\)-tag information and better jet mass reconstruction, but this has not been investigated here.

## 5 Event Selection

Using the tools outlined in the previous section, we now characterise the samples and outline the specific cuts applied for each final state considered.

Figure 13: Pseudo-rapidities of the forward and backward quarks in signal events after they radiate the vector bosons, obtained from Pythia before any showering, fragmentation, etc.

### \(W^{+}W^{-}\to\ell^{\pm}\nu\ jj\) and \(W^{\pm}Z\to\ell^{\pm}\nu jj\)

The hadronic vector boson candidates and the tag jets are obtained using the \(k_{\perp}\) algorithm as discussed in Section 4.1. The leptonic \(W\) is identified as described in Section 4.2.3. Both vector boson candidates are required to have \(p_{T}>200\) GeV, \(|\eta|<2\). Tag jet cuts are made as described in Section 4.3, with \(p_{T\rm{cut}}=10\) GeV, \(E_{\rm{cut}}=E_{\rm{2cut}}=300\) GeV and \(\Delta\eta_{\rm{cut}}=5\). The top veto (Section 4.5) and the the central jet veto (Section 4.4) are applied.

The kinematic distributions for the \(WW\) channel are shown in Fig. 14. Note that these are significantly biased by the generator-level cuts. The selection efficiencies of the cuts on \(WW\) events from four example scenarios are summarised in Table 6, along with the efficiency of the combined trigger selection described in Section 3. No significant differences are observed between the scalar and vector resonances, nor between the \(WZ\) and \(WW\) channels, except for the \(m=500\) GeV-resonant samples, where the \(p_{T}\) requirements are found to be less efficient for the \(WZ\) sample. The QCD-like model of [27] tends to predict softer vector bosons.

Due to the small background statistics available with full simulation, the full-simulation signal samples are used together with fast-simulation background samples in obtaining the final results. The modelling of the kinematics is good, as shown in Fig. 143. However, in general the efficiency for selecting both signal and background is higher in fast simulation by about 25% compared to full simulation. To account for this, a constant scaling factor is applied to the fast-simulation samples in estimating the significance of the signal over the background (Section 6).

Footnote 33: To achieve this agreement it was necessary to correct the lepton-finding efficiency in the fast simulation by fitting a function to the efficiency from fast and full simulation as a function of lepton \(p_{T}\) and correcting the fast simulation by the ratio of the functions.

Figure 15 shows a comparison of the final \(WW\) mass for the signal samples using fast and full simulation.

The final \(WW\) mass spectra obtained using this analysis are shown in Fig. 16. The backgrounds shown have been obtained from the fast-simulation samples and the above mentioned scaling factor has been applied.

### \(W^{\pm}Z\to jj\ \ell^{+}\ell^{-}\)

This channel benefits from a very good resolution on the \(Z\) boson leptonic reconstruction, which allows good suppression of the \(t\bar{t}\) background.

For the \(m=1.1\) TeV \(WZ\) resonance, only the case of a single heavy jet from the \(W\) boson decay will be considered as it constitutes the majority of the events. For the \(m=800\) GeV resonance, not all \(W\) bosons are boosted sufficiently to produce a single jet. We therefore consider separately the cases of a \(W\) boson from a single heavy jet and from a jet pair. Finally, for the \(m=500\) GeV resonance, we only consider the jet pair case. In this section, the cone algorithm will be used and compared with an analysis using the \(k_{\perp}\) jet algorithm.

#### 5.2.1 \(W\) boson from a single jet

The main backgrounds will here be \(Z\)+ 3 jets and \(t\bar{t}\).

Table 7 shows the cut flow for the electron-based and the muon-based analyses for the ChL \(WZ\) resonances of mass \(m=1.1\) TeV and \(m=800\) GeV. The \(m=500\) GeV case is not considered here since the \(W\) and \(Z\) bosons will not be sufficiently boosted, in general, to produce a single jet. The \(Z\to e^{+}e^{-}\) and \(Z\to\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\) selections are shown, which correspond each to about 50% of the sample events. After applying electron quality cuts (_medium_ electrons) we select the two highest \(p_{T}\) leptons which should satisfy respectively: \(p_{T}(e,\mu)>50\) GeV and \(p_{T}(e,\mu)>35\) GeV. The low efficiency of the lepton pairFigure 14: Kinematic distributions for the generated signal and backgrounds (\(t\bar{t}\) and \(W\)+4 jets QCD) in the 1.1 TeV \(W^{+}W^{-}\to\ell^{\pm}\nu\ j(j)\) channel. The top two plots show the \(p_{T}\) and \(\eta\) for the hadronic \(W\) boson candidate. The middle two show the same variables for the leptonic \(W\) boson candidate. The bottom two plots show the \(\eta\) distribution of all jets which are at higher rapidity than the \(W\) boson candidates, and the \(p_{T}\) distribution of the highest-\(p_{T}\) central jet. In each plot, the full-simulation histograms (solid lines) have been normalised to unit area and the fast-simulation histograms (dashed lines) have been normalised to the same cross section as their full-simulation counterparts.

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:21]

cut is approximately consistent with the expected selection efficiency per lepton, as shown in Fig. 11, as well as the detector acceptance. As can be seen in Fig. 17, the \(p_{T}\) cut suppresses mostly the \(t\bar{t}\) background. A leptonic \(Z_{e^{+}e^{-}}\) or \(Z_{\mu^{+}\mu^{-}}\) is afterwards reconstructed as described in Section 4.2.2, almost eliminating completely this background. The efficiency of this cut is somewhat poorer for the signal than for the background because most of the background events have \(Z\) bosons of relatively low \(p_{T}\), with different lepton pair energies and opening angle.

Using the cone algorithm, size 0.8, the hadronic \(W\) boson candidate is identified as a heavy single jet having a mass between 70 and 100 GeV, and separated in azimuthal angle from the \(Z\) boson candidate by \(\Delta\phi(W,Z)>2\), as described in Section 4.1 (see Fig. 18). At this stage, considering that the fraction of single jet \(W\) bosons becomes important for \(p_{T}>250\) GeV (see Fig. 5), and in order to be consistent with the preselection cuts on the \(Z\)+3 jets background, we apply the following cuts to the reconstructed \(W\) and \(Z\) bosons: \(p_{T}{}^{W,Z}>250\) GeV and \(|\eta^{W,Z}|<2.0\).

After a forward jet selection, (see Section 4.3, \(p_{T}{}_{\rm cut}=20\) GeV, \(E_{\rm cut}=E_{\rm 2cut}=300\) GeV, \(\eta_{\rm cut}=1.5\), \(|\eta_{f\,jet}|>\eta_{\rm central\ jet}\), \(\Delta\eta_{\rm cut}=4.5\)), the invariant mass of these two jets is required to be greater than 700 GeV. Note that the efficiency of the forward jet cuts appearing in Table 7 appears artificially good for the background because a preselection was already applied.

A central jet veto was found to be unnecessary, as no \(t\bar{t}\) event survived the selection. Because of the lack of statistics for the \(t\bar{t}\) sample, it is not possible to exclude completely a contribution from this background. The normalisation factor is 4.9, meaning that \(t\bar{t}\) is excluded, over the whole mass range, at the level of 11.3 fb at 90% C.L. To have an estimate of the efficiency of the last two cuts at rejecting this background, the mass window for the cut on the \(Z\) boson mass was loosened: \(60<m_{Z}<120\) GeV, allowing 44 events (215 fb) to pass for the \(Z\to ee\) channel and 38 events (185 fb) for the \(Z\to\mu\mu\) channel. The \(W\) boson mass cut alone is found to have an efficiency of 12% and the forward jet cut alone lets no event survive. Assuming that the cuts are independent, the overall efficiency of the heavy jet mass cut and forward jet tagging combined is higher than 0.15%. The exclusion limit at 95% C.L. (1.64 \(\sigma\)) for the \(t\bar{t}\) background is shown in Table 7 and it will be assumed that this is negligible in the mass window of the resonance. The \(Z\)+4 jets background was not included here because it may be double-counting with

\(Z\)+3 jets with parton shower. In order to evaluate the level of this background, an average over the high mass region was taken because of the relatively poor Monte Carlo statistics, yielding about 0.03 fb/100 GeV.

For the \(m=1.1\) TeV case, it was found that the trigger efficiency, based on the OR of e60, mu20 and j160, was 100% at the end of the selection.

Figure 20 shows the resonance mass resulting when the \(Z\) boson has been reconstructed from electrons or muons and the \(W\) boson from a single jet of size 0.8.

#### 5.2.2 \(W\) boson from a jet pair

As above, after applying electron quality cuts, the lepton transverse momenta are required to satisfy \(p_{T}(e_{1},\mu_{1})>50\) GeV and \(p_{T}(e_{2},\mu_{2})>35\) GeV, and a \(Z_{e^{+}e^{-}}\) (\(Z_{\mu^{+}\mu^{-}}\)) boson having a mass between 85 and 97 GeV (83 and 99 GeV) is then reconstructed. Considering all pairs of jets with \(p_{T}>30\) GeV in the central region (\(|\eta|<3.0\)) not overlapping with the electron jets from the \(Z\) decay, the one yielding an invariant mass closest to the mass of a \(W\) boson will be the \(W\) boson candidate (see Fig. 19). The low efficiency of this cut can be explained in part by the fact that a good fraction of events are constituted of a single jet \(W\) boson. Forward and backward jet selection proceeds as in 5.2.1. A central jet veto is also applied: we exclude events with an extra jet, having a \(p_{T}>30\) GeV, not corresponding to the jets from the \(W\) boson or the forward and backward jets and we require the \(W\) and \(Z\) directions to be in the central region \(|\eta|<2\). Figure 21 show the resulting reconstructed resonance masses. Table 7 summarizes the cut flow for this analysis. Here, by using the technique of widening the Z boson mass window as in Sect. 5.2.1, it is estimated that the \(t\bar{t}\) background could be approximately 0.13 fb and it will be assumed that this is negligible in the mass window of the resonance.

#### 5.2.3 Comparison to \(k_{\perp}\) analysis

This channel was also studied with the analysis techniques described in Section 5.1, with the \(k_{\perp}\) algorithm but using the leptonic \(Z\) boson identification (Section 4.2.2) instead of the leptonic \(W\) boson identification (Section 4.2.3). The hadronically-decaying \(W\) boson is reconstructed dynamically from one or two jets (Section 4.1).

The signal mass distributions for fast and full simulation are shown in Fig. 22. The final mass distributions are shown in Fig. 23, and are comparable to the results from the cone algorithm method for the 1.1 TeV case which is not sensitive to the cut on the \(p_{T}\) of the VB's of 200 GeV.

The background from \(t\bar{t}\) events has been found to be negligible.

### \(W^{\pm}Z\to\ell^{\pm}\nu\ \ell^{+}\ell^{-}\)

This purely leptonic channel consists of four different signatures: \(W_{\ell^{\pm}\nu}Z_{\ell^{\pm}\ell^{\mp}}\) with \(\ell=e,\mu\). The main background will be \(WZjj\) production from the Standard Model. The analysis starts by identifying leptonic \(Z_{e^{+}e^{-}}\) (\(Z_{\mu^{+}\mu^{-}}\)) bosons as described in Section 4.2.2, after requiring two leptons with \(p_{T}\) greater than 50 and 35 GeV.

As a second step, we proceed to reconstruct the \(W\) boson from the highest \(p_{T}\) lepton among those remaining in the event, if there is one, and the measured missing transverse energy, as described in Section 4.2.3. The solution which yields the highest \(p_{T}\)\(W\) boson is kept.

The forward and backward jet selection follows the prescription of the Section 4.3 (\(p_{T\text{cut}}=20\) GeV, \(E_{\text{cut}}=E_{2\text{cut}}=300\) GeV, \(\eta_{\text{cut}}=1.5\), \(|\eta_{f\,j\,\text{jet}}|>\eta_{\text{central jet}}\)), \(\Delta\eta_{\text{cut}}=4.5\)).

In Table 8 we present the cut flow of the reconstruction of the resonances for \(1.1\,\text{TeV}\) and \(500\,\text{GeV}\). Also in Fig. 25 and Fig. 25 we present the reconstructed resonance and the background \(WZjj\) for the same resonance mass.

### \(ZZ\to\nu\nu\ \ell^{+}\ell^{-}\)

This scalar resonance can be interpreted as a Standard Model Higgs boson produced by vector boson fusion. At leading order, the cross section times branching ratio would be 6 fb, compared to 4 fb obtained for the ChL model. This signal is characterised by a leptonic \(Z\) boson accompanied by large \(\not{E}_{T}\), yielding a large transverse mass. The backgrounds considered are: \(ZZjj\to\ell\ell\nu\nu jj\) and \(WZjj\to\ell\nu\ell\ell jj\). Other background can result from \(Z\)+jets production, where the tail of the missing transverse energy distribution can fake a signal.

After selecting the leptonically decaying \(Z_{e^{+}e^{-}}\) (\(Z_{\mu^{+}\mu^{-}}\)) boson as usual, with mass between 85 and97 GeV (83 and 99 GeV), a minimum \(\not{E}_{T}\) of 150 GeV is required. For this high value of \(\not{E}_{T}\), \(Z\)+jets background is expected to be negligible for a Standard Model Higgs boson signal [39]. The forward jet selection is applied (see Section 4.3, \(p_{T\mathrm{cut}}=20\) GeV, \(E_{\mathrm{cut}}=E_{2\mathrm{cut}}=300\) GeV, \(\eta_{\mathrm{cut}}=1.5\), \(\Delta\eta_{\mathrm{cut}}=4.5\)).

The transverse mass, defined as:

\[m_{T}^{2}=(\sqrt{p_{T}(Z)^{2}+m_{Z}^{2}}+\not{E}_{T})^{2}-(\vec{p}_{T}(Z)+\vec{ \not{p}}_{T})^{2} \tag{1}\]

is shown in Fig. 26 and the cut flow can be found in Table 9.

## 6 Results

The significance of the signals and the luminosity required for a possible discovery is estimated here. From the reconstructed resonance mass distributions in Section 5 one can evaluate the size of the signal and background in the resonance mass window. Table 10 summarises the approximate cross sections expected after the analyses described above. The table also gives the luminosity required to observe a significant excess over the background, showing the uncertainty from MC statistics only, and the significance of a signal for an integrated luminosity of 100 fb\({}^{-1}\). Because of the large statistical and systematic

Table 9: Cut flow for the \(Z_{\nu\nu}Z_{\ell\ell}qq\) (\(m=500\) GeV) signal. All the cuts are described in detail in this section.

uncertainties (see Section 7), the numbers given here must be taken as an only an approximate indication of the reach of the LHC for such resonances.

The significance is calculated as

\[\mbox{significance}=\sqrt{2((S+B)\ln(1+S/B)-S)}\quad, \tag{2}\]

where S (B) is the number of expected signal (background) events in the signal _peak_ region, which is defined as the three consecutive bins (of size given in the figures, chosen to represent the resolution), with the highest total number of signal events. The background is averaged over this region.

In the \(WW\) case, only the semileptonic channel is accessible. Thus, as shown in Table 10, around 25 fb\({}^{-1}\) is needed to start seeing indications of a resonance even in the most optimistic case studied here, and around 70 fb\({}^{-1}\) is needed for a discovery.

In the continuum case, the "signal" is spread over an extended mass region with a total of about 0.3 events expected for each fb\({}^{-1}\) in the mass range \(m=400\)-1900 GeV, compared to about 2.5 background events. Measuring this cross-section with any accuracy using the techniques developed here would require an integrated luminosity of several hundred fb\({}^{-1}\).

Since the mass windows for hadronic \(W\) and \(Z\) boson decays overlap, in practice these scenarios can probably not be distinguished in this channel, and a combined analysis would in reality have to be performed, which would then be compared to those channels containing a leptonic \(Z\) boson decay.

For each of the \(WZ\) resonances, results of the different channels, \(W_{\ell\nu}Z_{\ell\ell}\), \(W_{jj}Z_{\ell\ell}\) and \(W_{\ell\nu}Z_{jj}\) can, in principle, be combined. From Table 10, one can conclude that for two of three mass regions, \(m=500\) GeV and 800 GeV, a chiral Lagrangian vector resonance can be discovered with less than 100 fb\({}^{-1}\). The expectations with the alternative \(k_{\perp}\) analysis described in Section 5.2.3 are not far from the values in Table 10. As an example, the integrated luminosity needed for \(3\sigma\) observation of the \(m=800\) GeV signal is 63 fb\({}^{-1}\), and of the \(m=1.1\) TeV signal is 81 fb\({}^{-1}\).

A scalar resonance at \(m=500\) GeV will require about 60 fb\({}^{-1}\) to be seen in the \(ZZ\to\nu\nu\ell\ell\) channel.

Table 10: Approximate signal and background cross sections expected after the analyses. An approximate value of the luminosity required for \(3\sigma\) and \(5\sigma\) significance, and the expected significance for 100 fb\({}^{-1}\) are shown. The uncertainties, when given, are due to Monte Carlo statistics only.

Systematic Uncertainties

A number of large systematic uncertainties affect the signals studied here. Because of the small cross sections and the important backgrounds, it is difficult to estimate them with precision from Monte Carlo simulations. Data driven tests will be required to understand better the systematic effects. Some discussion of the most significant effects is given here.

### Background Cross sections

As was discussed in Section 2, the renormalisation and factorisation scales, \(Q^{2}\), can affect the cross section by as much as a factor of two. This is especially true at high centre of mass energies, where the degree of virtuality of partons and choice of scale for \(\alpha_{s}\) are quite critical [28, 29]. At present this represents a theoretical uncertainty on the current sensitivity estimate. While the predictions may improve in future, in an eventual analysis, the backgrounds would have to be measured from data and the eventual size of the associated systematic uncertainty has not been studied here.

Another consideration is that for the analyses which dynamically move between the dijet and single jet reconstruction technique for the hadronically decaying vector boson (see Section 4.1), to evaluate the background with the samples available both \(W\)+3 jet and \(W\)+4 jet samples must be used. This implies some double-counting due to the lack of parton-shower matching in these samples, and so the background will be overestimated. This is in addition to the fact that as shown in Section 2.4.1, the MadGraph samples used overestimate slightly the energy of the tag jets. The effect is expected to be at the few per cent level.

### Signal Cross sections

The Pythia signal generation produces softer tag jets than the more exact Whizard MC, and thus the signal efficiencies are likely to be underestimated.

### Monte Carlo Statistics

We are limited by the very large size of the background samples required. Fast MC simulation was shown to be in good agreement with full simulation and was used to evaluate \(t\bar{t}\) background for the \(WW\) signals. In some cases, only upper limits on the backgrounds can be given, although it is expected that these limits are very conservative. Again, this represents a systematic uncertainty on the current sensitivity estimates, but will not be present in a final data analysis, assuming sufficient simulated data will eventually be available.

### Pile-up and Underlying Event

Pile-up and underlying event are separate effects which have potentially similar and crucial impact on the efficiency of the forward jet cuts, the central jet veto and the top veto, as well as on the jet mass resolution.

Of particular concern is the fact that the top veto in the \(WW\) analysis uses jets down to \(p_{T}=10\,\)GeV, expected to be strongly affected by these effects [40]. Simply raising the cut to \(20\,\)GeV admits significantly larger background. Some of this can be removed for the higher mass resonances by raising the \(p_{T}\) cut on the vector boson. However, a more promising approach is likely to be to exploit \(b\)-tagging and improved jet mass reconstruction to improve the veto.

#### 7.4.1 Pile-up

Fully simulated samples with pile-up at low luminosity (\(10^{33}\)cm\({}^{-2}\)s\({}^{-1}\)) were available, but with much lower statistics: we restricted the analysis to one signal sample and one background sample. However pile-up effects should be approximately independent of the underlying physics sample, and we assume we can safely generalise the results obtained here.

We compared the same events of the \(W_{jj}Z_{\ell\ell}\) at \(m=1.1\) TeV sample reconstructed with and without pile-up simulation. This allows computation of the fraction of events with pile-up having tagged forward jets with respect to corresponding non-pile-up events which fail the tagged jet criterion, thus defining a 'fake' rate. The reciprocal fraction defines a'miss' rate. The effect of pile-up increases with increasing jet radius and decreasing energy threshold, as would be expected. We found that both 'fake' and'miss' effects are essentially due to the degradation of energy resolution in presence of pile-up and that their combination contributes to an uncertainty on the efficiency of the order of 5%.

#### 7.4.2 Underlying Event

Current simulations use underlying event models tuned to Tevatron and other data [22], but there is a large extrapolation needed to 14 TeV. The underlying event would be have to be measured in LHC data, and its level is not currently known.

### Other Systematic Effects

Systematic effects, such as uncertainties in the luminosity, in efficiencies and resolutions, jet energy scale, etc. are of the order of a few percent and will therefore be completely dominated by the above effects and by statistical uncertainties.

## 8 Summary and Conclusion

The Chiral Lagrangian model with Pade unitarisation provides a framework for studying vector boson scattering at high mass, in case a light Higgs boson is not found at the LHC in the first years of running. With full detector simulation, the search for vector and scalar resonances of masses \(m=500\), 800 and 1100 GeV is studied. To suppress the very high backgrounds from \(W\)+jets and \(Z\)+jets to acceptable levels requires special techniques investigated here. In particular, at these high masses, hadronic vector boson decay results in a single jet. The reconstruction of the jet mass is found to be generally quite efficient at rejecting QCD jets. The \(k_{\perp}\) and the cone algorithms can be applied to this heavy jet to resolve it into two light jets, suppressing further the background. Other conventional techniques for the study of vector boson fusion are also found essential for the present analysis: forward jet tagging, central jet veto and top-jet veto.

The cut-based analysis presented here is performed with realistic simulation and reconstruction of leptons and jets. Improvements can be expected by more sophisticated analysis and, with real data and a good understanding of the detector, further gains can be achieved by improvements in the reconstruction efficiencies.

The discovery of resonances in vector boson scattering at high mass will take a few tens of fb\({}^{-1}\), but the different decay channels of the vector boson pairs allow a cross-check of the presence of a resonance. These results can be considered generic of vector boson scattering and can therefore be interpreted in terms of other theoretical models with possibly different cross-sections.
