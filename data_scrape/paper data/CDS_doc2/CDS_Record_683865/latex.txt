###### Abstract

The LHC will be a top "factory". The NLO prediction that \(\sigma(t\overline{t})=833\) pb in \(pp\) collisions at \(\sqrt{s}=14\) TeV [1] implies that more than 8 million \(t\overline{t}\) pairs per year will be produced in low luminosity (\(10^{33}\) cm\({}^{-2}\) s\({}^{-1}\) ) running of the LHC. Using a high-\(p_{T}\) isolated lepton tag, for example, to select \(t\overline{t}\) events in which at least one of the produced \(W\)'s decays leptonically, and assuming a \(b\)-tagging efficiency of 60%, approximately 600k single lepton plus jets events with one \(b\)-tag will be selected for an integrated luminosity of 10 fb\({}^{-1}\). Such high statistics samples will give ATLAS unprecedented sensitivity to various possible rare decay modes of the top quark, and provide a potential window to physics beyond the Standard Model.

This note describes the results of studies to quantify the ATLAS sensitivity to rare flavour changing neutral current (FCNC) and radiative decays of the top quark. Standard Model predictions for the branching ratios of FCNC decays are around \(10^{-10}\) or less, so any observation at the LHC would be a signal of new physics. Significant increases in these branching ratios are predicted in SUSY extensions to the SM, and also arise in models including new dynamical interactions of the top quark, multi-Higgs doublets, or new exotic fermions, for example.

The "radiative" top decay \(t\!\rightarrow\!\!WbZ\) has been suggested as a sensitive probe of the top quark mass, since the measured value of \(m_{t}\) is close to threshold for this decay. For \(m_{t}=174.3\)\(\pm\) 5.1 GeV [2, 3], the predicted branching ratio for this decay is about 5 \(\times\)\(10^{-7}\), but varies by a factor of approximately three within the current uncertainty on the mass. A measurement of BR(\(t\!\rightarrow\!\!WbZ\)) could therefore provide a strong constraint on \(m_{t}\). Similar arguments have been made for the decay \(t\!\rightarrow\!\!WbH\), assuming a relatively light SM Higgs (\(m_{H}\approx m_{Z}\)).

## 2 Rare Decays of the Top Quark

In the Standard Model, the dominant decay of the top quark is \(t\!\rightarrow\!\!Wb\), which has a branching ratio of approximately 99.9%. (Note that charge conjugate decays such as \(t\!\rightarrow\!\!W^{+}b\) and \(\overline{t}\!\rightarrow\!\!W^{-}\overline{b}\) are not distinguished here and elsewhere in this note). Predictions for the CKM-suppressed decays are approximately 0.1% for \(t\!\rightarrow\!\!Ws\) and 0.01% for \(t\!\rightarrow\!\!Wd\). The large mass of the top quark implies, however, that it would tend to couple strongly to other massive particles, anddetermining whether it has the couplings and decays predicted by the SM is therefore a sensitive probe of physics beyond the SM.

In this note we examine the expected ATLAS sensitivity to two classes of rare decays: flavour changing neutral current decays \(t\)\(\rightarrow\)(_c_, _u_)(_Z_, \(\gamma\)), and radiative decays \(t\)\(\rightarrow\)\(WbX,\) (\(X=Z,H\)). These studies have been performed using PYTHIA 6.1 [4] and ATLFAST 1.53 or 2.0 [5]. In all cases, PYTHIA was used to generate \(t\bar{t}\) pairs at \(\sqrt{s}=14\) TeV with \(m_{t}=175\) GeV, using CTEQ2L structure functions and including initial- and final-state radiation, hadronisation and multiple interactions corresponding to low luminosity running of the LHC. For the produced \(t\bar{t}\) pairs, one of the quarks was allowed to decay via the dominant \(t\)\(\rightarrow\)\(Wb\) channel, while the other was forced to decay via the rare decay mode in question. ATLFAST was used with its default parameters for low luminosity running, including jet energy corrections [5]. A 90% efficiency for reconstructing isolated leptons (\(e,\mu\)) and a \(b\)-tagging efficiency of 60% (with a rejection factor of 100 against light quark jets) were assumed.

### Flavour Changing Neutral Current Decays

Within the Standard Model, FCNC decays such as \(t\)\(\rightarrow\)\(cZ\) are forbidden at the tree level by the GIM mechanism. They do occur at the one-loop level however, though strongly suppressed, and have expected branching ratios on the order of \(10^{-12}-10^{-10}\)[6, 7]. At such levels, no SM FCNC decays can be observed at the LHC.

Supersymmetric extensions to the SM lead to significantly larger predictions for the FCNC branching ratios [8, 9], on the level of \(10^{-8}-10^{-6}\), although these are probably still too small to be observable at the LHC. Other extensions of the SM, such as models with new dynamical interactions of the top quark, multi-Higgs doublets, or new exotic fermions, may however give rise to further significant enhancements in the FCNC branching ratios [7, 10, 11, 12, 13].

Current experimental limits on FCNC decays from CDF [14] are shown in Table 1, along with predictions for both SM and MSSM branching ratios.

#### 2.1.1 \(t\)\(\rightarrow\)\(Zq\)(\(q=u,c\))

The enormous QCD backgrounds at hadron colliders make the search for the signal via hadronic decays of the \(W\) and \(Z\) (\(t\bar{t}\)\(\rightarrow\)\(WbZq\)\(\rightarrow\)\(6\)-jets) very difficult. We have chosen to study the case where the \(Z\) decays leptonically (\(Z\)\(\rightarrow\)\(l^{+}\)\(l^{-}\), \(l=(e,\mu)\)), which significantly reduces the backgrounds and provides a relatively clean experimental signature. Given the selection of the

\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|c|} \hline FCNC decay & BR in SM & BR in MSSM & Expt. lim. (95\% CL) \\ \hline \(t\)\(\rightarrow\)\(qZ\) & \(\sim 10^{-12}\) & \(\sim 10^{-8}\) & \(<0.33\) \\ \(t\)\(\rightarrow\)\(q\gamma\) & \(\sim 10^{-12}\) & \(\sim 10^{-8}\) & \(<0.032\) \\ \(t\)\(\rightarrow\)\(qg\) & \(\sim 10^{-10}\) & \(\sim 10^{-6}\) & - \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 1: SM and MSSM predictions for the branching ratios for FCNC decays of the top quark. Also shown are current experimental limits.

leptonic decay mode of the \(Z\), the final state is then determined by the decay mode of the \(W\). If it decays leptonically (\(t\overline{t}\)\(\to\)\(WbZq\)\(\to\)\(l\nu l^{+}l^{-}\) + 2-jets), the signature is three leptons (with \(m_{l^{+}l^{-}}\)\(\approx\)\(m_{Z}\)), missing \(E_{T}\), and at least two jets, one of which is a \(b\)-jet. If the \(W\) decays hadronically (\(t\overline{t}\)\(\to\)\(WbZq\)\(\to\)\(l^{+}l^{-}\) + 4-jets), the signature is two leptons (again with \(m_{l^{+}l^{-}}\)\(\approx\)\(m_{Z}\)), and at least four jets, one of which is tagged as a \(b\)-jet. The hadronic \(W\) decay mode has a much larger branching ratio, but suffers from larger backgrounds. We examine each in turn.

\(t\overline{t}\)\(\to\)\((l^{+}l^{-})q(l\nu)b\)

In order to reconstruct the \(Z\)\(\to\)\(l^{+}l^{-}\) decay, selection cuts required a pair of opposite-sign, same-flavour (\(e,\mu\)) leptons, each having \(p_{T}>20\) GeV and \(|\)\(\eta\)\(|\)\(<2.5\). The invariant mass of the lepton pair was required to be within 4 GeV of \(m_{Z}\). Fig. 2 shows the \(l^{+}l^{-}\) invariant mass distribution from a sample of 20,000 signal events. The invariant mass distribution for each \(Zq\) combination was formed, requiring each jet to have \(p_{T}>30\) GeV and \(|\)\(\eta\)\(|\)\(<2.5\) (Fig. 2). Fitting this distribution with a Gaussian plus third order polynomial yields a \(Zq\) mass resolution of 6.6 GeV.

Since the \(Z\)\(\to\)\(l^{+}l^{-}\) signature is rather clean, the dominant backgrounds for this search are from processes having a \(Z\) in the final state (\(Z\)+jets and \(W\)+\(Z\) production), and from \(t\overline{t}\) decay in which both top quarks decay to \(Wb\) where the final state includes an opposite-sign, same-flavour lepton pair with \(m_{l^{+}l^{-}}\)\(\approx\)\(m_{Z}\).

With the selection cuts described above, the dominant background is from \(Z\)+jets. Additional cuts, based on the \(Wb\) decay of the second top quark in the event, can be used to reduce this background contribution. In the case of a leptonic decay of the \(W\), requiring a (third) high-\(p_{T}\) lepton and/or large missing transverse momentum (due to the escaping neutrino) provides significant rejection against the \(Z\)+jets background. Figs. 4 and 4 show the number of leptons and missing \(p_{T}\) from signal and background sources. Additional cuts required a third lepton (\(p_{T}\)\(>\) 30 GeV, \(\mid\eta\mid<2.5\)), and \(p_{T}^{miss}>\) 30 GeV. The number of jets provides additional discrimination against the \(Z\)+jets, and to a lesser extent \(W+Z\), backgrounds (see Fig. 5). A second jet, with \(p_{T}>\) 30 GeV and \(\mid\eta\mid<2.5\), was required. Finally, one (and only one) \(b\)-jet, other than the jet in the \(Zj\) combination, was required. This is effective in reducing all remaining backgrounds.

Table 2 shows the signal efficiency and number of background events for \(\int{\cal L}\cdot{\rm dt}=10\) fb\({}^{-1}\) as each successive cut is applied. The efficiencies do not include the \(Z\to l^{+}l^{-}\) and \(W\to l\nu\) branching ratios. A cut requiring the (\(llj\)) invariant mass to be within 15 GeV of \(m_{t}\) was applied in determining the backgrounds. The assumed cross-sections are those calculated by PYTHIA 6.1, except for the inclusive \(t\bar{t}\) cross-section, for which the NLO prediction \(\sigma_{t\bar{t}}=833\) pb is used. The relevant cross-sections for this analysis are shown in Table 4, along with those used for the \(t\)\(\rightarrow\)\(\gamma q\) and \(t\)\(\rightarrow\)\(WbZ\) analyses later in this note. Since the \(Z\)+jets cross-section is large (the inclusive cross-section is about 110 nb, ignoring the \(\gamma^{*}\) and \(Z/\gamma^{*}\) interference contributions), events were generated with \(\hat{p}_{T}>30\) GeV, where \(\hat{p}_{T}\) is the transverse momentum of the hard parton interaction.

The branching ratio sensitivity, assuming a 5\(\sigma\) signal significance (\(S/\sqrt{B}\)) for discovery, is given by:

\[{\rm Min.\,BR}=\frac{5\sqrt{B}}{2\int{\cal L}\cdot{\rm dt}\;(\sigma\times\,{\rm BR })\,\varepsilon} \tag{1}\]

where \(B\) is the total number of background events, \(\int{\cal L}\cdot{\rm dt}\) is the integrated luminosity, \(\sigma\times{\rm BR}\) is the \(t\overline{t}\) cross-section (including appropriate branching ratios) and \(\varepsilon\) is the reconstruction efficiency. The factor of 2 in the denominator arises since either of the two produced top quarks can decay to \(q\,Z\). With the cuts described above, and assuming \(\int{\cal L}\cdot{\rm dt}=10\,{\rm fb}^{-1}\), one remaining background event is expected. Requiring at least five events for signal observation, the branching ratio sensitivity is 4.7 \(\times 10^{-4}\). Since the background has been reduced almost to zero, the sensitivity should improve almost linearly with integrated luminosity. An order of magnitude improvement on this limit may therefore be achievable for \(\int{\cal L}\cdot{\rm dt}=100\,{\rm fb}^{-1}\).

\(t\overline{t}\)\(\rightarrow\)\((l^{+}l^{-})q(jj)b\)

For the hadronic decay mode of the \(W\), the final state is \(l^{+}l^{-}\) + 4-jets, one of which is a \(b\)-jet. The \(Z\) selection criteria were the same as for the leptonic mode described above, and the invariant mass distribution for each \(Zq\) combination formed, requiring each jet to have \(p_{T}>30\) GeV and \(|\,\eta\,|<2.5\), as before. Fitting the invariant mass distribution with a Gaussian plus third order polynomial yields a \(Zq\) mass resolution of 6.6 GeV. In addition, at least four jets with \(p_{T}>30\) GeV and \(|\,\eta\,|<2.5\) were required, one being a \(b\)-jet. To reduce the \(Z\)+jets and QCD backgrounds, the other top quark was reconstructed via its decay \(t\to jjb\). Pairs of non \(b\)-tagged jets were required to have an invariant mass within 20 GeV of \(m_{W}\) (see Fig. 7), and these \(W\) candidates then combined with the \(b\)-jet and required to have an invariant mass within 25 GeV of \(m_{t}\) (see Fig. 8). An increased jet \(p_{T}\) cut (\(>50\) GeV) proved effective in reducing backgrounds still further.

Table 4 shows the signal efficiency and number of background events for \(\int{\cal L}\cdot{\rm dt}=10\) fb\({}^{-1}\) as each successive cut is applied. The efficiencies do not include the \(Z\to l^{+}l^{-}\) and \(W\to jj\) branching ratios. A cut requiring the \((llj)\) invariant mass to be within 15 GeV of \(m_{t}\) was applied in determining the backgrounds. With only one background event expe

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:8]

applying this analysis to a sample of 10,000 signal events. The \(m_{\gamma j}\) mass resolution was 7.7 GeV, and the overall selection efficiency (not counting branching ratios) was 3.3%, including a \(b\)-tagging efficiency of 60%.

After the cuts, the total background with real photons, normalised to an integrated luminosity of 100 \(fb^{-1}\), consisted of 50 \(t\bar{t}\) events with negligible contributions from the other processes. Assuming a somewhat conservative jet rejection of about 2900 for photons with \(p_{T}>40\) GeV [15], larger backgrounds resulted from fake photons, namely 90 \(t\bar{t}\) events, 10 events from single top production, and 5 events from \(W\)+jets including \(Wb\overline{b}\). The total background was therefore 155 events, dominated by \(t\bar{t}\) events. The corresponding 5\(\sigma\) discovery limit for an integrated luminosity of 100 \(fb^{-1}\) was BR(\(t\rightarrow\gamma q\)) = 1.0 \(\times 10^{-4}\).

#### 2.1.3 \(t\)\(\rightarrow\)\(gq(q=u,c)\)

A search for the decay \(t\)\(\rightarrow\)\(gq\) would be overwhelmed by QCD multi-jet event background. It has been noted however that evidence for a FCNC \(t\)\(-\)\(g\)\(-\)\(q\) coupling could be sought through the production of like-sign top pairs [17]. A study to search for like-sign top pair production has been performed in ATLAS and indicates that the expected branching ratio sensitivity for an integrated luminosity of 100 \(fb^{-1}\) is BR(\(t\to gq\)) = 7.4 \(\times 10^{-3}\)[15].

### Radiative Decays

#### 2.2.1 \(t\)\(\rightarrow\)\(WbZ\)

The top quark mass \(m_{t}=174.3\)\(\pm\) 5.1 GeV [2, 3] is close to the threshold for the radiative decay \(t\)\(\rightarrow\)\(WbZ\) (\(\Sigma[m_{W}+m_{b}+m_{Z}]\approx 176.1\) GeV). The branching ratio for \(t\)\(\rightarrow\)\(WbZ\) is therefore strongly dependent on the top mass and, if observable, might provide a powerful constraint on the value of \(m_{t}\).

The partial width, \((t\)\(\rightarrow\)\(WbZ)/\), \((t\)\(\rightarrow\)\(Wb)\) as a function of \(m_{t}\) is shown in Fig. 10[19, 20]. With the current uncertainty on the top mass, the SM prediction is BR\((t\)\(\rightarrow\)\(WbZ)=(5.4^{+4.7}_{-2.0})\times 10^{-7}\), corresponding to a factor of \(\sim\) 3 variation in the decay rate.

Sensitivity to the \(t\)\(\rightarrow\)\(WbZ\) decay has been studied using PYTHIA 6.1 and ATLFAST 1.53 to simulate \(t\)\(\overline{t}\)\(\rightarrow\)\((WbZ)(Wb)\), where the \(Z\) is reconstructed in the leptonic decay channel \(Z\to l^{+}l^{-}(l=e,mu)\), and the \(W\) (from the \(WbZ\) decay) in the two-jet hadronic channel \(W\)\(\rightarrow\)\(jj\). The final state for the \(t\)\(\rightarrow\)\(WbZ\) decay is therefore \((l^{+}l^{-}jjb)\). The \(t\)\(\rightarrow\)\(WbZ\) decay was incorporated into PYTHIA, assuming (non-optimised) three-body phase space for the decay kinematics.

Selection cuts required an opposite-sign, same-flavour di-lepton pair, each lepton having \(p_{T}>\) 30 GeV and \(|\,\eta\)\(|\)\(<\) 2.5, and invariant mass of the lepton pair between 60 and 100 GeV. At least three jets were also required, each jet having \(p_{T}>\) 30 GeV and \(|\,\eta\)\(|\)\(<\) 2.5, with the invariant mass of one two-jet combination satisfying 70 \(\leq\)\(m_{jj}\)\(\leq\) 90 GeV. A \(b\)-veto was applied to each of the two jets consistent with \(m_{W}\), and a \(b\)-tag required on the third jet. The reconstruction efficiency for the \(WbZ\) exclusive channel using these selection criteria is very low, due to the soft \(p_{T}\) distribution of the produced \(b\)-jet. Preliminary estimates of branching ratio sensitivity in the exclusive mode indicated that it would be at least three orders of magnitude higher than that expected in the Standard Model, for an integrated luminosity of 30fb\({}^{-1}\).

In order to improve the reconstruction efficiency, the semi-inclusive measurement \(t\)\(\rightarrow\)\(WZ\) has been examined. Since the \(t\)\(\rightarrow\)\(WbZ\) decay is so close to threshold, the resolution of the \((WZ)\) invariant mass distribution should not be significantly degraded with respect to the exclusive measurement. Applying the same selection cuts described above to the lepton pair and two jets, reconstructed \(Z\) and \(W\) peaks are clearly seen (shown in Figs. 11, 12 for a signal sample of 100,000 events), and also a peak in the \((l^{+}l^{-}jj)\) invariant mass distribution (Fig. 13). The resolution \(\sigma\,[m_{WZ}]=7.2\)\(\pm\) 0.4 GeV, with a signal efficiency of about 3.5%.

The clean \(Z\to l^{+}l^{-}\) signature for this decay means that the dominant backgrounds come from processes with a \(Z\) in the final state, primarily \(Z\)+jet production, and to a much lesser extent from \(W+Z\) production and \(t\)\(\overline{t}\) production. In order to reduce the \(Z\)+jet background, an additional cut requiring a third lepton with \(p_{T}>\) 30 GeV is made. For the signal process \(t\)\(\overline{t}\)\(\rightarrow\)\((WbZ)(Wb)\), this cut selects events in which the \(W\) from the other top quark decays leptonically, with a corresponding drop in signal efficiency of \(\sim\) 5, but reduces the \(Z\)+jet background by more than three orders of magnitude. Table 5 shows the number of background events normalised to 10fb\({}^{-1}\) from \(Z\)+jet, \(W+Z\) and \(t\)\(\overline{t}\) production with the selection cuts described above, and with a cut of \(\pm\) 10 GeV about the top mass.

For an integrated luminosity of 10fb\({}^{-1}\), the total number of background events expected is one. Requiring at least five events for signal observation leads to a branching ratio sensitivity of \(6.4\times 10^{-4}\). Removing the \(b\)-veto on the two jets consistent with the \(W\) results in a 10-20%Figure 11: Invariant mass distribution of opposite-sign, same-flavour lepton pairs (\(l=e,\mu\)), showing the \(Z\) selection cuts. Figure 12: Invariant mass distribution of \(jj\) pairs, with a \(b\)-veto applied to both jets in the pair. The \(W\) selection cuts are also shown.

deterioration in sensitivity. With an integrated luminosity of 100fb\({}^{-1}\), a factor of ten improvement on this limit might be achievable. The branching ratio sensitivity would still be about two orders of magnitude larger than the expected SM branching ratio however, and would not allow observation of the SM decay \(t\!\rightarrow\!\!WbZ\).

#### 2.2.2 \(t\!\rightarrow\!\!WbH\)

Fig. 14 shows the branching ratio for \(t\!\rightarrow\!\!WbH\) as a function of \(m_{\,H}\)[20]. With the current LEP limit on the Higgs mass \(m_{\,H}>107.7\) GeV [21], the branching ratio, \((t\!\rightarrow\!\!WbH)/\), \((t\!\rightarrow\!\!Wb)\) is at most approx. \(5\times 10^{-8}\). As \(m_{\,H}\) increases further, B\((t\!\rightarrow\!\!WbH)\) drops rapidly. Assuming \(m_{\,H}\approx m_{\,Z}\), one would have to search for \(t\!\rightarrow\!\!WbH\) using the dominant decay \(H\!\rightarrow\!\!b\overline{b}\). The final state suffers much more from background than in the case of \(t\!\rightarrow\!\!WbZ\), where the clean \(Z\to l^{+}l^{-}\) signature is a key element in suppressing background. Although B\((H\!\rightarrow\!\!b\overline{b})\) in this \(m_{\,H}\) range is much larger than B\((Z\to l^{+}l^{-}\) ), the large increase in background will more than compensate for the increased signal acceptance, and so it is clear that the sensitivity to B\((t\!\rightarrow\!\!WbH\) ) will be worse than for B\((t\!\rightarrow\!\!WbZ)\). The decay \(t\!\rightarrow\!\!WbH\) has therefore not been studied in further detail.

## 3 Conclusion

A study of the expected ATLAS sensitivity to the flavour changing neutral current decays \(t\!\rightarrow\!(c,u)(Z,\gamma)\) and radiative decays \(t\!\rightarrow\!\!Wb(Z,H)\) of the top quark has been performed. For an integrated luminosity \(\int\!{\cal L}\cdot{\rm dt}\,=100\) fb\({}^{-1}\) the expected branching ratio sensitivities for the FCNC decays are \(4.5\times 10^{-5}\) (\(t\!\rightarrow\!\!Zq\)) and \(1.0\times 10^{-4}\) (\(t\rightarrow\gamma q\)), and \(6.4\times 10^{-5}\) for the radiative decay \(t\!\rightarrow\!\!WbZ\). Detection of the SM decays \(t\!\rightarrow\!\!WbZ\) and \(t\!\rightarrow\!\!WbH\) does not appear possible.
