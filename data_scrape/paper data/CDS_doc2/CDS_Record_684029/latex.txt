**Abstract.** A detailed study of the background rates after the Event Filter for the three major B-physics channels was made. The estimates of the rates were made with modified offline code xKalman using samples of background and signal events with pileup at low luminosity. The total semi-inclusive B-physics trigger rate after LVL2 and Event Filter is expected to be at the level of 0.82% from the initial trigger rate at LVL2. Taking into account the possibility of the reduction in the muon rate at EF by factor of 1.5 - 1.6, the total rate for the exclusive B-channels will be about 40 Hz at EF.

The ATLAS trigger strategy consists of three steps of event rate reduction, namely LVL1, LVL2 and event filter (EF). At LVL1, all the events containing a muon with \(p_{T}>6\) GeV are accepted as candidates to \(b\bar{b}\)-events. LVL2 and EF combined should provide a reduction factor of the order of \(10^{3}\) with respect to the output rate after LVL1. For B-physics, the expected background event rate after LVL2 is 1 kHz at low luminosity. The task of the EF is to reduce this rate by a factor of about 10. The difficulty to reduce the rate is that most of event candidates are genuine B-event wrl decay channels that those of interest. A complete and accurate reconstruction of the concrete set of B-events is necessary in the Inner Detector. At the EF, more complicated algorithms can be implemented than at LVL2; in particular, it is foreseen that a secondary vertex fit will be available at the EF. All the track parameters will be known with accuracies close to offline reconstruction resolutions. This will allow the use of sharper mass cuts for some semi-inclusive B-decay channels compared to those used at LVL2. The knowledge of the B-decay vertex makes possible to use additional cuts components to LVL2.

This investigation of the reduction in LVL2 output rate at the EF was made for three channels important for CP-violation measurements, \(\rm B^{0}_{d}\to J/\psi K^{0}_{s}\), \(\rm B^{0}_{s}\to\pi^{+}\pi^{-}\), \(\rm B^{0}_{s}\to D_{s}\pi\) and \(\rm B^{0}_{s}\to D_{s}a_{1}\) with the subsequent decays \(\rm D_{s}\to\phi\pi\) and \(\phi\to K^{+}K^{-}\).

The study was made using the offline reconstruction package xKalman and offline code for the secondary vertex fit [1].

## 1 Signal and background samples.

An optimization of the selection criteria was performed on three signal-event samples:

* \(\rm B^{0}_{d}\to J/\psi K^{0}_{s}\);
* \(\rm B^{0}_{s}\to\pi^{+}\pi^{-}\);
* \(\rm B^{0}_{s}\to D_{s}\pi\).

These events contain a LVL1 trigger muon from the semileptonic decays of the \(b\)-quark in addition to the indicated B-hadron decay.

As a background to these channels, \(b\bar{b}\)-events with a muon with \(p_{T}>6\) GeV were considered. An average of 2.4 minimum-bias events in SCT and 3.2 minimum-bias events in TRT are superimposed on the signal and background events, as expected for low luminosity running (\(10^{33}s^{-1}cm^{-2}\)).

## 2 Inclusive \(J/\psi\) trigger at Event Filter.

The \(B^{0}_{d}\to J/\psi K^{0}_{s}\) decay is a gold-plated mode to measure the angle \(\beta\) of the unitarity triangle through the measurement of the time-dependent CP asymmetry in this decay. Due to the high \(b\bar{b}\) cross-section at LHC energies, ATLAS will be able to provide a highly accurate measurements of \(\sin(2\beta)\).

The high-level trigger strategy for the selection of the \(B^{0}_{d}\to J/\psi K^{0}_{s}\) events is based on the selection of \(J/\psi\). The most difficult case for the \(J/\psi\) identification is when the \(J/\psi\) decays into two electrons. It was shown in [2] that at LVL2 a rejection of 97.6% of the background sample can be achieved whilst maintaining a 61% efficiency for the signal events \(J/\psi\to e^{+}e^{-}\).

The criteria to select events with a \(J/\psi\) at LVL2 are summarized below:

* \(p_{T,reco}(e)>0.5\) GeV; electron pair identification in the TRT; requirement of a hit in the B-layer for every electron candidate; \(\geq 7\) hits in the pixel and silicon trackers per electron track;* Difference between the measured pseudorapidities of the two electrons, \(\mid\Delta\eta\mid<1.5\)
* Sum of \(p_{T}\)'s of two electrons \(p_{T}=p_{T1}+p_{T2}>3\) GeV
* Difference between the intersection points of the extrapolated trajectories of the two electrons with the z-axis \(\mid\Delta z\mid<2\) cm
* Mass window \(2<M(J/\psi)<3.8\) GeV

With these cuts all the \(J/\psi\)'s, both prompt and from the \(B\)-decays, that had passed the LVL2 selection, were selected by the Event Filter. The rate for inclusive \(J/\psi\) triggers was 3.4% of the initial LVL2 muon rate.

The strategy to reduce the trigger rate at the EF is based on the fit to the track pairs forming \(J/\psi\) candidates. All \(J/\psi\) candidates found at LVL2 pass through the fit procedure. The fit determines the vertex position of the \(J/\psi\) decay, the \(\chi^{2}\) of the fit and the invariant mass.

The cuts applied at the EF to select the \(J/\psi\)'s originating from \(B\)-decays are close to those applied in offline analysis. The difference is that at the EF all the required cuts are softer than used offline. The selection criteria at the EF are shown below:

* \(\chi^{2}\) of two-track fit is less than 8 (in offline \(\chi^{2}<6\));
* transverse decay position of \(J/\psi\)\(L_{thr}>220\mu m\) (\(>250\mu m\) in offline)
* mass window \([-8\sigma,+4\sigma]\) around nominal \(J/\psi\) mass, \(\sigma=60\) MeV

After applying these cuts the LVL2 output rate can be suppressed by a factor 4.5. In addition to the quantities used in the offline selection, a cut on the angle \(\alpha\) between the line joining the \(J/\psi\) and primary vertices and the \(p_{T}\) of \(J/\psi\) can be introduced without signal loss. The distribution on the angle \(\alpha\) is shown for the signal and background in Fig.1. Applying a cut \(\alpha<40^{\circ}\) provides an additional reduction of a rate by a factor of 2.2. After applying the LVL2 and EF cuts based on the vertex fit, the expected rate is 0.35% of initial BG rate.

The cuts applied on the transverse decay position of the \(J/\psi\) and angle \(\alpha\) lead to loss of events containing only prompt \(J/\psi\)'s. Omitting these two cuts leads to a large BG rate for this channel, \(\sim 1.8\%\). If it is required to select events with prompt \(J/\psi\)'s an opposite cut to \(L>L_{thr}\) cut could be applied to select the promt \(J/\psi\)'s - transverse decay length of \(J/\psi\) should be less than \(L_{thr,prompt}\). The value \(L_{thr,prompt}\) is defined by the accuracies of the reconstruction of the primary and secondary vertices,

\[L_{thr,prompt}=\sqrt{(\sigma^{2}_{xy,primary}+\sigma^{2}_{xy,jpsi})}. \tag{1}\]

Here

\[\sigma_{xy,primary}=\sqrt{(\sigma^{2}_{x,prim}+\sigma^{2}_{y,prim})}=23\mu m \tag{2}\]

The values of \(\sigma_{x(y),prim}\) are published in [3], and for \(B\to J/\psi K_{s}\) events are of order 30 \(\mu m\). The resolutions on x, y for the secondary vertex were estimated using the real fitted \(J/\psi\) and obtained to be around 70 microns. In this case, \(L_{thr,prompt}=102\,\mu m\) corresponds to 1 sigma of the measured distance between the primary and secondary vertices. The trigger rates for the prompt \(J/\psi\)'s measured for the threshold \(L<L_{thr,prompt}=170\,\mu m\) and the three \(p_{T}\) thresholds for the electrons from \(J/\psi\) decays are shown in the Table 1.

It is obvious from the Table 1 that a \(p_{T}\) threshold of 0.5 GeV for the electrons from prompt \(J/\psi\)'s gives an unacceptably high rate.

So, the total rate for \(J/\psi\to e^{+}e^{-}\) channel could be at level of 0.47-0.62 %. The first number, 0.47%, correspond to the selection of all \(J/\psi\)'s from B decays and prompt \(J/\psi\)'s with electron \(p_{T}>1.5\) GeV. The second rate, 0.62% of initial LVL2 rate, corresponds to the selection of all \(J/\psi\)'s from B decays and prompt \(J/\psi\)'s with electron \(p_{T}>1.0\) GeV.

## 3 Selection of \(\rm D_{s}\) at EF.

The selection for the \(\rm D_{s}\to\phi\pi\) channel is based on the reconstruction of the invariant mass of the \(\phi\) from combinations of track pairs using a kaon hypothesis, and subsequently the \(\rm D_{s}\) from the combination of the \(\phi\) candidate and another track using a pion hypothesis. An additional cut based on the angular distribution of the K-mesons from \(\phi\) meson could be implemented at LVL2 to reduce the rate for this channel. The decay \(\rm D_{s}\to\phi\pi\) with subsequent decay of \(\phi\to K^{+}K^{-}\) is a decay of a particle with spin 0 into a \(\phi\) with spin 1 and \(\pi\) with spin 0. The \(\phi\) decays onto two kaons with spin 0. For this kind of decay, in the general case, the angular distribution of a particle with spin 0 originating from a particle with spin 1 (kaon in our case) in the rest frame of particle with spin 1 has a \(\theta\)-dependence \(N(\theta)\sim cos^{2}(\theta)\). In our case the angle \(\theta\) is the angle between \(K^{+}\) and \(\pi\) in the rest frame of \(\phi\)-meson. The distributions of the angle \(\theta\) in the signal and BG events are shown in Fig.2. For the combinatorial background, the \(N(cos(\theta))\) distribution is flat while for the signal events the \(N(cos\theta)\sim cos^{2}(\theta)\). Applying the cut \(|\ cos(\theta)\ |>0.4\) provides and addition factor 1.5 of reduction in rate without signal losses.

In addition to the LVL2 selection criteria, a fit to the track pair forming a \(\phi\)-meson was made. If the two tracks form a good \(\phi\) meson candidate (i.e the fitted mass is within a tight mass window \(\pm 3\sigma\) and the \(\chi^{2}\) of the fit is less than 6), then the third track is added and all three tracks are fitted to the \(D_{s}\) meson. The following criteria are applied to the "\(\rm D_{s}\)" meson candidates:

* \(M_{fitted}\in[M_{D}-4\sigma;M_{D}+4\sigma]\) (\(\sigma=13.6\) MeV);
* \(\chi^{2}<6\) of fit;
* Transverse decay position of \(\rm D_{s}\) should be larger than \(180\,\mu m\) ( \(>226\,\mu m\) in offline.)

The same cuts are applied in the offline analysis (with tighter requirements). The estimated BG rate for \(D_{s}\to\phi\pi\) is \(\sim 0.67\%\); the biggest reduction comes from tight mass cuts on the fitted \(D_{s}\) and from the cut on the transverse decay position of the \(D_{s}\)-meson. A further background rate reduction could be achieved by applying a cut on the angle \(\alpha\) between a line joining the \(\rm D_{s}\) and primary vertices and the \(p_{T}\) of \(\rm D_{s}\). In Fig.3 the distributions of \(\alpha\) for real (upper) and combinatorial (bottom) \(D_{s}\) mesons are demonstrated. Comparison of the \(\alpha\) distributions in BG and signal events shows that a cut \(\alpha<20^{\circ}\) could be implemented at the EF without loss of signal. It is possible due to the kinematical selection of the \(\rm D_{s}\)'s products and the cut \(p_{T}>10\) GeV for \(B_{s}^{0}\)-meson applied in offline analysis. If one neglect the longitudinal components and the difference in \(p_{T}\)'s of \(B_{s}\) and \(D_{s}\) mesons, the calculations show that \(D_{s}\) meson could move in the opposite to \(B_{s}\)-meson direction only if the \(p_{T}\) of \(B_{s}\) is less than 10 GeV.

If the transverse momenta of \(\rm D_{s}\)'s products would be smaller, the angle \(\alpha\) should be taken larger.

After applying these selection criteria one can expect the 0.45% of the initial (events containing a LVL2 muon) BG rate (after the LVL2 it was 2.1%).

\begin{tabular}{||c||c||} \hline \hline \(p_{T}\) threshold, GeV & Final BG rate, \% \\ \hline \hline

1.0 & 0.28 \\ \hline
1.5 & 0.13 \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}

## 4 \(B^{0}_{d}\rightarrow\pi^{+}\pi^{-}\) trigger.

To select \(B^{0}_{d}\) candidates, invariant masses were calculated for pairs of oppositely-charged particles with \(p_{T,reco}>\) 4 GeV. Every track was required to have a hit in the B-layer. If the effective mass of two tracks was within mass window 4.5-6 GeV then a vertex fit was made. The selection criteria after the fit are summarized below:

* Mass window 4.5-6 GeV
* \(\chi^{2}<8\) of fit
* angle less than 5 degrees;
* transverse decay length larger than \(100\,\mu m\) (\(>200\,\mu m\) in offline)

Only \(5.2\times 10^{-2}\) % of events in the BG sample containing a LVL2 muon remain after these cuts.

## 5 Conclusions.

An additional reduction of the background rate by factor 10 can be obtained at the EF using the strategy which includes a vertex fit together with the introduction of selection criteria in addition to the offline analysis.

For the \(J/\psi\)'s, the additional cut on the angle \(\alpha\) between line joining the \(J/\psi\) and primary vertices and the \(p_{T}\) of \(J/\psi\) is proposed to reduce the background rate for the \(J/\psi\)'s originating from the \(B\)-mesons. To select the prompt \(J/\psi\)'s, the requirement on consistency of the \(J/\psi\)-vertex with primary vertex is introduced.

For the selection of \(D_{s}\) originating from \(B_{s}\) the additional cut on the angle \(\alpha<20^{o}\) is proposed which allows a reduction in the background rate by a factor 2. Another cut which is not used in the offline analysis is implemented that allows to reduse the number of accepted background events by a factor \(\sim\) 1.5. This is cut on the angle between \(K^{+}\) and \(\pi\) in the rest frame of \(\phi\)-meson. Both these additional cuts can be used to reject the fake \(D_{s}\) mesons decayed on \(K^{*}K\) mode.

The background rate from the \(J/\psi\), \(D_{s}\) and \(B^{0}_{d}\rightarrow\pi^{+}\pi^{-}\) after LVL2 and EF is expected to be at the level of 0.82% from the initial muon trigger rate at LVL2. The preliminary estimations made with offline software show that the input rate of muons with \(p_{T}>\) 6 GeV for LVL2 could be reduced by a factor of 1.5-1.6 due to the rejection of muons originating from pions and kaons decayed in flight [4]. So, the initial LVL2 rate was assumed to be 5 KHz. The expected rate for the exclusive B-physics channels after EF is 5 KHz \(\times\) 0.82% = 41 Hz.
