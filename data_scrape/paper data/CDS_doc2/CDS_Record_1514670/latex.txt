###### Abstract

This note describes conical layouts of ATLAS upgrade pixel detector. Comparison to the baseline LOI layout is presented as well.

## 1 Introduction

The high luminosity upgrade of the LHC requires new pixel detector for the ATLAS experiment. A baseline layout [1] for Letter of Intent (LOI) was prepared using conventional approaches to the detector geometry design. Alternative layouts are also being considered. This note presents approximate description of conical layouts and comparison to the baseline layout.

## 2 Motivation

The concept of a conical pixel barrel was developed to address problems with the transition of a barrel geometry to a disk endcap geometry that are aggravated by the integrated stave designs being developed for Phase-2 ATLAS upgrade. An integrated stave contains electrical functions embedded into the mechanical support structure in order to reduce mass and front-load integration effort. Rather than having to individually cable modules as done in the present pixel detector, an integrated stave functions analogously to a crate back-plane onto which many modules are mounted. This makes assembly faster and more reliable. Interconnection of the stave to services and upstream data acquisition is handled by dedicated hubs at the stave ends (called End of Stave cards). The EOS cards can incorporate high bandwidth communication to serve a group of modules with a small number of services, rather than each module having its own services. While the advantages are clear, the drawback is that the EOS cards must take up physical space at the ends of the stave. Not only does this result in dead material in front of the endcaps, it also increases the physical distance, \(d\), from the last active pixel on a stave to the first active pixel on the corresponding endcap. In terms of layout this means that endcap outer active radius must be greater than the barrel outer active radius by \(d\cdot\tan\theta_{max}\), where \(\theta_{max}\) is the maximum polar angle covered by the outer barrel layer for the extreme of the beam spot. As \(d\) increases due to EOS cards, the large endcap radius relative to the barrel leads to difficulties in designing a global support frame and and in passing barrel services outside the endcaps.

The conical layout is based on integrated staves structures with a flat middle section and bent ends, known as bent staves. This stave geometry was inspired in the Babar vertex detector. This model is appealing because the construction of integrated staves proceeds by lamination of face sheets, flex cables, and foam core elements on to tooling which does not have any fundamentally preferred shape. Construction of a bent stave core is exactly the same as construction of a flat stave (same steps and same materials), it just uses different tooling. Fig. 1 shows a prototype bent section of a stave core, built with exactly the same materials and methods as prototype flat staves. This prototype has been subjected to the same sequence of mechanical tests as flat stave elements and showed equal performance (for example the CTE mismatch between the tube and the core does not cause problems because the shape is bent).

A conical barrel layout has two main intended advantages and a third accidental (but welcome) advantage. 1) The endcap outer radius is reduced to match the barrel. Now both barrel and endcap can have the same outer radius, making mechanical global support, servicing, and integration straightforward. The reason is that the excess endcap radius given by \(d\cdot\tan\theta_{max}\) is relative to the radius of the end of the stave,

not the center, and the end of the stave is now at lower radius that the center. 2) The EOS cards are moved to higher eta (by moving them to lower radius), shifting the dead material away from the critical eta range. 3) The crossing angle of tracks and photons passing through the bent sections is decreased relative to a flat stave, which reduces the material in the eta ranged covered.

## 3 Conical Layouts

The LOI layout [1] of ATLAS upgrade Inner Tracker is shown in Fig. 2. This layout adheres to the performance specifications described in [2].

In order to simplify the comparison of the conical layouts to the LOI layout, the conical layouts were designed using the LOI layout as a basis. A layout optimized to take full advantage of the conical geometry would be different (for example it would cover more pseudorapidity with the barrel allowing to reduce the endcaps), but this would be less straightforward to compare. Therefore, the inner barrel layers and endcap disks were left intact in these layouts.

The bent staves add flexibility to the placement and length of the barrel layers. Two different layouts presented in this note show this flexibility and how it could be used to optimize the performance and cost of the detector. The high instantenous luminosity after the LHC upgrade causes many tracks in the inner detector and the track pattern recognition requires optimization of distances between the pixel and strip layers.

In the first layout (option A), the two outer barrel layers were placed equidistant between the inner pixel and strip layers. The smaller distance between the pixel and strip layers should improve the pattern recognition and fake rate rejection. This layout is shown in Fig. 3.

In the second layout (option C), the two outer barrel layers were left at the same radii but shortened to reduce the silicon area and decrease the cost of the detector. This layout is shown in Fig. 4.

In both cases, the bent staves in the two outer layers help keeping the hermiticity of the pixel detector and distances between the barrel and endcap parts. The barrel has almost the same \(\eta\)-coverage as in the LOI layout. The details of the layouts could be found in the Appendix A.

## 4 Preliminary Comparison of the Performance

The preliminary comparison of the performance of the Conical layouts and LOI layout has been made using the "idres" program by Nigel Hessey [3] and plotting macros from Ian Watson. The parameters for comparison are chosen to be similar to the ones used in [1].

### Preliminary Material Estimate

The estimated material for the LOI and Conical layouts is shown in Figs. 6 and 6. As mentioned above, the crossing angle of tracks passing through the bent sections is decreased relative to a flat stave therefore the material in the regions of bent staves is reduced. The spikes down are due to larger overlaps of the end of barrel and endcaps which could be either tuned or used as additional measurements.

This estimate doesn't take into account increased overlaps of the bent sections of the barrel staves in the Conical layout.

### Hermiticity and Number of Pixel Hits

The number of pixel hits as a function of \(\eta\) is shown in Figs. 8 and 8. These plots show that the number of pixel hits in the Conical layouts is the same or better as in the LOI layout.

### Momentum Resolution

The momentum resolution as a function of \(\eta\) is shown in Figs. 10-12. The momentum resolution is slightly improved for the very high \(P_{T}\) tracks in the conical layout A. The momentum resolution improves for low \(P_{T}\) tracks in the bent stave regions due to material effects.

### Distance between hits

The distance between pixel and strip hits as a function of \(\eta\) is shown in Figs. 14 and 14. As expected the distances are smaller for the barrel part of the conical layout A.

## 5 Pixel silicon area

The total area of the pixel sensors in the LOI layout is 7.36 \(m^{2}\). An estimate of the area for the suggested Conical layout A (C) is 7.68 \(m^{2}\) (6.85 \(m^{2}\)). This estimate takes into account the increased overlaps of the bent sections of the barrel staves.

## 6 Conclusion

The bent staves add flexibility to the design of the Pixel detector. It was shown that the performance of the conical layouts could be the same or better than the one of the baseline LOI layout. Additional optimization of the conical layouts is possible by changing the endcap geometry.
