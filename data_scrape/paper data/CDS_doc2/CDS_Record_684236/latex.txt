Introduction

This note summarizes recent thermal qualification tests of prototypes of the pixel detector disk sectors. The disk sectors support pixel modules in the disk (end) regions of the pixel detector. The components of a disk sector are shown in Figure 1.

## 2 Thermal Qualification Criteria and Test Procedures

### Thermal Qualification Criteria

The thermal requirements, including stress testing, are defined in the document on ATLAS Pixel Local Supports Requirements.[1] The series of thermal qualification tests used to qualify the sector design is summarized in Table 1.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|l|} \hline _1. 50 thermal cycles 20\({}^{\prime}\) C to -35\({}^{\circ}\) C_ \\ \hline _2. Thermal shock 20\({}^{\prime}\) C to -35\({}^{\circ}\) C in \(<\) 60 sec_ \\ \hline _3. Pressure to 8 bar absolute_ \\ \hline _4. 50 thermal cycles 20\({}^{\prime}\) C to -35\({}^{\circ}\) C_ \\ \hline _5. Irradiate to 50 MRad_ \\ \hline _6. 50 thermal cycles 20\({}^{\prime}\) C to -35\({}^{\circ}\) C_ \\ \hline _7. Thermal shock 20\({}^{\prime}\) C to -35\({}^{\circ}\) C in \(<\) 60 sec_ \\ \hline _8. Pressure to 8 bar absolute_ \\ \hline _9. 50 thermal cycles 20\({}^{\prime}\) C to -35\({}^{\circ}\) C_ \\ \hline _10. Loss of coolant (sector in air at 20\({}^{\prime}\) C)_ \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}

### Test Procedures

Dummy heaters were used in place of actual pixel modules. The dummy heaters were platinum-coated silicon. The thin platinum was deposited by evaporation on the silicon in a footprint that simulates the heat distribution expected for the pixel module electronics. Each of the heaters had a resistance of 6-7 ohms. The three on each side of a sector were connected in series to a power supply at around 20 V to provide about 25 W of power to each side of the sector. The coolant used in the test was water at around 21\({}^{\circ}\) C. The flow rate in all tests was close to 0.75 liters/minute. Prior to testing, the sectors and heaters were coated with black paint to ensure uniform surface emissivity. Thermal cycling damaged the paint in some small areas, but no important data were lost. Tests were done in air at room temperature. Unpainted heaters on a sector are shown in Figure 2.

Temperature data were taken with an Inframetrics model 600L Infrared Imaging Radiometer at a distance of about 25 cm. This gave a temperature map of the surface, with resolution to within a fraction of a degree. Data from one side only of the sectors are given in this paper, but the results are typical of measurements on the other sides of both sectors.

The temperature difference between the incoming coolant and the hottest point on the sector is an important measure of sector performance. These values, along with the thermograms after each test, are given in the subsequent sections.

## 3 Prototypes

The test results on two prototypes are described in this note. The two prototypes differ only in the thermal compound used to connect the aluminum tube to the sector facings. Prototype 11 used CGL-7018, a thermally conductive paste adhesive, between the aluminum tube and the sector facings.[2] Prototype 12 used an epoxy-based, thermally conducting adhesive.[3]

### Second thermal cycling test

The sectors were exposed to an additional 50 cycles from 20\({}^{\circ}\) C to -35\({}^{\circ}\) C, for a total of 100 cycles. The cycling damaged paint on sector 12. However, most of the sector was unaffected, and accurate temperature readings were possible.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|} \hline _Conditions (average)_ & _Sector 11_ & _Sector 12_ \\ \hline _Coolant temperature (\({}^{\circ}\) C)_ & _21.0_ & _20.8_ \\ \hline _Coolant flow (liters/min)_ & _0.76_ & _0.75_ \\ \hline _Power to heaters (W)_ & _48.4_ & _49.1_ \\ \hline _Maximum_\(\Delta T\) (\({}^{\circ}\) C)_ & _7.6_ & _7.2_ \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}

### **Fourth thermal cycling test**

Each sector was cycled an additional 50 times from 20\({}^{\circ}\) C to -35\({}^{\circ}\) C, for a total of 200 temperature cycles.

### **Loss of coolant test**

A loss of coolant fault was simulated by shutting off the flow of water to the sectors during operation. Sector 11 warmed from 20\({}^{\circ}\) C to 100\({}^{\circ}\) C within 1 minute. After 5 minutes, sector temperature levelled off at about 135\({}^{\circ}\) C. After equilibrium at 135\({}^{\circ}\) C was established, coolant flow was restored, cooling the sector to 30\({}^{\circ}\) C within 1 minute and close to equilibrium within 2 minutes.

After loss of coolant, sector 12 warmed from 25\({}^{\circ}\) C to 90\({}^{\circ}\) C within 1 minute and to an equilibrium temperature of 142\({}^{\circ}\) C after 5 minutes. The restoration of coolant flow brought the sector to about 30\({}^{\circ}\) C within 20 seconds.

## 5 Conclusions

All results are summarized in Table 13. Both sectors easily meet the requirement of a maximum \(\Delta\)T \(<\) 15\({}^{\circ}\) C.
