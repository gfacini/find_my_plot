During August 2002 the LArg Barrel calorimeter module P13 was exposed to monoenergetic electron beams at the H8 beam lines. The precise measurement of the beam energy allowed the detailed study of the detector response linearity in the range 10 to 180 GeV. The result critically depends on the way the detector samplings are weighted to account for the energy losses upstream and downstream the module. This problem is discussed in detail with the help of simulated data. Other reconstruction effects affecting the linearity are also discussed.

Introduction

An energy scan of the response to electrons of barrel module P13 was performed at the H8 test line in August 2002. The beam was centered at the position

\[\eta=0.687\hskip 28.452756pt\phi=0.282\]

(corresponding to the center of the middle compartment cell \(i\eta\)=27 \(i\phi\)=11), and data, typically about 20000 events per energy point, were taken for 16 energy values between 10 and 180 GeV.

Following the proposals in [1, 2], an effort was done to control the beam energy at a level better than 0.1 %, through the precise measurement of the current injected in the magnets of the selecting spectrometer, and the control measurement of the magnet field through two Hall probes. The analysis to extract the beam energy values and their errors, based on the work on previous data by S. Hassani [3], is discussed in section 2.

A standalone simulation package based on Geant4, mainly developed by G. Parrour, was used to evaluate the performances of energy reconstruction in terms of linearity, resolution and uniformity. In particular, the sampling fraction for the different layers of the calorimeter were computed in order to understand the intrinsic linearity of the detector and the best strategy to account correctly for the energy missed in the passive material in front of the module, and for the energy leaked downstream. The results are summarized in section 3.

We then evaluate in section 4 different effects that can affect the linearity in the reconstruction of real data, namely calibration, pedestal subtraction, geometrical corrections, pion rejection, clustering algorithm.

Finally, real data are compared to the simulated ones and the result for linearity is given in section 5.

## 2 Precise determination of electron beam energy

### The method

The H8 beam line is sketched in fig. 1. The electron momentum is selected by two triplets of bending magnets (B3 and B4) between the collimators C3 and C9, whose geometry is kept fixed during the energy scan. The selected momentum is thus proportional to the bending power \(\int Bdl\) along the beam path. Each bending

magnet is 5 m long and provides a field of 1.42 T/kA. The C3 collimator aperture was set to 4 mm as a compromise between beam intensity and momentum spread. The resulting spread of 0.15 % renders the systematic uncertainty from the beam alignment \(\ll\) 0.1 %. Since our goal is to measure the detector linearity, we are not interested in the precise knowledge of the absolute momentum scale, that will be arbitrarily normalized to some value.

The magnets in the same triplet are pulsed in series. The current flowing in the B3 magnets was measured through a DCCT, with a nominal accuracy of \(1\times 10^{-4}\). The B4 magnets were not needed, and they were off and degaussed, for energies up to 180 GeV. This limits the energy range where the accurate energy measurement is available.

Calibration measurements on reference magnet MBN-25 were performed during February 2002 by a group from SL division [4, 5], relying on the fact that the \(\int Bdl\) of the \(\sim\) 100 MBN magnets have been tuned to be equal within \(\pm 2\times 10^{-4}\). The magnet bending power was measured from the voltage induced, during the magnet pulsing, in a loop made of two wires stretched along the beam path. The two wires are separated by a distance of a few cm that is known with 100 \(\mu\)m accuracy.

To cross-check the systematic errors coming from the current measurement and from hysteresis, several direct measurements of magnetic field were performed as well. The field value \(B_{0}\) at the magnet center was measured as a function of the current using NMR probes with accuracy better than \(10^{-5}\). Since for the magnets in the beam line the central region is not accessible, it was decided to monitor the field by placing two small Hall probes1 in the MBN-57 magnet of the B3 triplet, just outside the beam pipe (see figure 2). The Hall probes allow to measure the field with an accuracy of a few Gauss in a border region where the field inhomogeneity prevent the use of NMR probes. The probes were calibrated against the NMR ones in the MBN-25 magnet.

Footnote 1: the probes were provided by NIKHEF, that developed them for the ATLAS muon system [6]

Figure 3 shows the measured points for \(B_{0}\) and for the bending power. The points were fitted with polynoms (with fit residuals \(\;\raise 1.29pt\hbox{$<$\kern-7.5pt\raise-4.73pt\hbox{$\sim$}}\;\;1\times 10^{-4}\)) to get a parameterization. Figure 4 shows the calibration curve of one hall probe. The variation of the ratio between the fields measured by the hall and NMR probes is mainly due to the non-linearity of the Hall probes, other than to the different position inside the magnet.

Figure 3: The upper plots show the calibration measurements of the magnetic field, at the center and integrated on the beam path, as a function of the current. The fitted parametrization are shown on top of the measured points. The lower plots show the deviation from linearity due to saturation (the linear fit is obtained from the points with \(I<500\) A).

### Accuracy of the \(\int Bdl\) calibration

The largest systematic errors affecting linearity in the \(\int Bdl\) calibration measurements come from

* the uncertainty on the offset of the integrator used in the measurement, and on the field before the current pulse (the magnet is pulsed starting from a current of 0.2 A), corresponding to 1 Gauss\(\cdot\)m. However at limited values of the current (I\(<\)300 A) the equivalent length \[L_{eq}=\frac{\int Bdl}{B_{0}}\] is expected to be constant. The fit shown in figure 5 gives: \[L_{eq}\ \mbox{(small I)}=5.1270\pm 0.0003\ \mbox{m}\] and we can use \(\int Bdl\) = \(L_{eq}\cdot B_{0}\) to keep this error within 0.01 % even at low current;
* the uncertainty on the remnant field. The same unipolar degaussing cycle was performed before each measurement in order to run on the same hysteresis loop. The remnant field, affecting both \(B_{0}\) and \(\int Bdl\) and thus not \(L_{eq}\), was measured [5] to be \(9\pm 1\) Gauss. An uncertainty of \(\pm 0.5\) Gauss comes from the earth magnetic field, that was not compensated in the calibration setup. Adding the two in quadrature we get an uncertainty on \(\int Bdl\) of 6 Gauss\(\cdot\)m per each magnet.

Figure 4: Ratio between the fields measured by the Hall probe 82 at its nominal position and the NMR probe at the center of the magnet.

similar measurements performed in 1977 on another reference magnet. As shown in figure 6, the apparent distortion at low current of the ratio of both \(\int Bdl\) and \(B_{0}\) values almost disappears when considering the equivalent length. This can be explained by an offset in the 1977 current measurements, where the uncertainty on the absolute current was as large as 1 A, ten times more than the recent measurements. In fact, after shifting the 1977 current values by 0.9 A, the two calibrations agree much better, and also the linearity of the magnet field for low current values improves at the same levels observed in 2002.

The residual raise of \(L_{eq}\) for \(I>1000\) A is understood to be due to a difference among the magnets used for the calibration. In fact, according to the 1977 calibration measurements, the MBN-25 magnet (used in the 2002 calibration) exhibits some larger discrepancy than the average with respect to the reference magnet, as shown in fig. 7. The plotted numbers were used as a correction when transporting the calibration curve to the B3 magnets of the beam line. The maximum size of this correction, amounting to \(3\times 10^{-4}\) in the range of interest (I\(<\)1150 A), was taken as an estimation of the systematic error from the difference among magnets.

### Analysis of the Hall probe measurements

Along the data taking the two Hall probes were used to check the reproducibility of the magnet field for a given value of the current.

Unfortunately, during the August 2002 energy scan, the Hall probes measurements were not available. However data at different electron energies are available from earlier test beam periods:

* 80 kbursts from October 2001, with a similar setup except that a different DCCT was in use, having an accuracy of \(1\times 10^{-3}\);
* 150 kbursts from June/July 2002 with the final setup.

These data were analyzed to validate the accuracy of the current measurements.

For each bursts three measurements of the current and the hall probes are available. Some quality checks are performed on the measurements:

* no errors from DAQ must be present;
* at least two of the three current measurements must be compatible within 3 % or 0.5 A, and the others are rejected.

Finally we consider the measurement with the current value closer to the average.

The pedestal values of the probes were measured during the calibrations. The stability of these values during the data taking can be checked looking at the bursts with magnet off, where only the remnant field is expected to be measured (fig. 8).

Figure 8: The three component of the magnetic field as measured without current in the magnet. The values of the pedestals are indicated by the horizontal lines. In the \(z\) direction, the typical remnant field of \(\pm 10\) Gauss (the sign depending on the latest field orientation, i.e. the beam charge) is observed.

The Hall probe specifications indicate a response variation with the temperature of \(-3\times 10^{-4}/^{\circ}\)C. This can be checked by observing the temperature dependence of the field for the bursts with a fixed value of the current, as shown in fig. 9. The measurements, taken at a temperature between 20 and 33 \({}^{\circ}\)C, were extrapolated at 15.5 \({}^{\circ}\)C, that is the normalization value used in the calibration. In order to remove a trend with the temperature of the field difference between the two probes, different temperature slopes were applied: \(-3\times 10^{-4}/^{\circ}\)C for probe #82, \(-2.4\times 10^{-4}/^{\circ}\)C for probe #83.

The difference of the field measured by the two probes (after applying the calibrations) is usually within 1 Gauss, though some variations of the central value are observed between different data-taking periods (see fig. 10 and 11). These are probably the effect of some interventions resulting in small displacements of the

probes2.

Footnote 2: since the probes are in a region of significant field inhomogeneity, their response is critically dependent on their positioning. During the calibrations it was observed [4] that the uncertainty from the probe positioning amounts to about 10 Gauss.

Finally, the field obtained from the Hall probe can be compared with the field that can be deduced from the current measurement using the calibration. The result, as a function of the current value, is shown in fig 13. Data are plotted for several periods and, except for a small shift after July 3 (probably due to the probe repositioning), the same pattern persists. It is thus clear that the magnetic field for a given value of the current is reproduced within a few Gauss.

However, for large values of the current the field tends to deviate from the expected value, with a maximum disagreement of 0.15 %. It has been checked that this effect is not temperature dependent. A plausible explanation is that the observed discrepancy reflects a real difference between the field in the border region (where the Hall probes are located) of the two magnets MBN-57 and MBN-25. We already noticed (figure 7) that the bending power of MBN-25 magnet tends

to become smaller with respect to MBN-57 as the current increases. Moreover, some measurements of \(B_{0}\) for MBN-57, done with an NMR probe, were performed during 2001, and they agree remarkably well with the ones done on MBN-25 (fig. 12). Thus, the difference in \(\int Bdl\) must arise from the border region, a result which agree, at least qualitatively, with the Hall probe measurements.

In conclusion, the magnetic field survey with the Hall probes show no hints of possible systematic errors of the current measurement, though the accuracy of the check is limited to the 0.1 % domain by the uncertainty on the equality among magnets in the border region and by the positioning accuracy of the probes.

### Corrections and results

The current measurements performed during the August 2002 energy scan were analyzed to compute the beam energy. The same quality cuts of the Hall probe analysis were applied. Along each run the current is observed to be stable within 0.01 A. The average value is calculated for each run and the bending power is computed from the calibration fit. The following errors and corrections are applied:

* the error from the spread of current value \(\sigma_{I}\) was obtained as \(\sigma_{I}\times\frac{d(\int Bdl)}{dI}(<I>)\);
* the quoted error on the remnant field produces an uncertainty on each energy point of \[\sigma_{\int Bdl}^{remnant\ field\ B3}\ =\ \sqrt{3}\times 6\ \mathrm{Gauss}\cdot\mathrm{m}\ =\ 10\ \mathrm{Gauss}\cdot\mathrm{m}\] where we summed in quadrature the contributions of the 3 B3 magnets. The B4 magnets were degaussed with a bipolar cycle and switched off during the whole data-taking. The uncertainty on their remnant field is 1 Gauss, but in this case the systematic shift is constant in time, and this can be taken into account by adding linearly the different contributions. Thus, we estimate a systematic error \[\sigma_{\int Bdl}^{remnant\ field\ B4}\ =\ 3\times 1\ \mathrm{Gauss}\times L_{eq}\ =\ 15\ \mathrm{Gauss}\cdot\mathrm{m}\] common to all the energy points. These turn out to be the dominant uncertainties in the momentum calculation;
* the correction for the difference among magnets were computed using the numbers in figure 7, and a systematic error of \(3\times 10^{-4}\) was applied as explained in section 2.2;
* the energy loss due to synchrotron radiation was computed assuming a uniform loss along the beam trajectory \[-\frac{dE^{\,s.r.}}{dx}=1.268\times 10^{-6}\mathrm{GeV}/m\times(E(\mathrm{ GeV})B(T))^{2}\]The spectrometer will select electrons entering the C3 collimator with energy \(E^{unc}+(\delta E)^{s.r.}/2\) and leaving the C9 collimator with energy \(E^{unc}-(\delta E)^{s.r.}/2\), where \(E^{unc}\) is the uncorrected energy and

\[(\delta E)^{s.r.}=1.268\times 10^{-6}\ {\rm GeV}\times\int dl({\rm m})(E({\rm GeV} )B(T))^{2}\]

The integral is estimated by averaging \(E^{unc}(\int Bdl)^{2}/L_{mag}\) and \(E^{unc}(\int Bdl)B_{0}\) (\(L_{mag}=L_{eq}\) for I\(<\)300 A), the difference between the two quantities resulting in a maximum effect of 7 MeV at 180 GeV. The smaller losses in the downstream focusing magnets B5 and B6 are also taken into account.

The effect depends on the absolute energy scale, on which we assume an error of \(\pm\) 1 %, resulting in a maximum uncertainty of 15 MeV at 180 GeV.

The fluctuation of the s.r. loss can be computed using the formula

\[\left(\frac{\sigma_{(\delta E)^{s.r.}}}{E}\right)^{2}=\theta_{b}\cdot 5\cdot 1 0^{-22}(B(T))^{2}\gamma^{3}\]

where \(\theta_{b}=41\) mrad is the bending angle. The effect on the average energy \(\sigma_{\delta E}/(E\cdot\sqrt{N_{electrons}})\) has a maximum value of \(1.5\times 10^{-5}\) at 180 GeV and it thus negligible.

The final numbers are reported in the following table, where the momentum scale was normalized to 100 GeV:

The resulting uncertainty on the linearity measurement, estimated with a simple Montecarlo simulation where a perfect linearity is assumed and the beam energies fluctuate according to the quoted errors, amounts to \(3\times 10^{-4}\). A further systematic error of 11 MeV, due to the B4 magnets and common to all the points, must be added.

Study of Energy Reconstruction on Montecarlo data

The electromagnetic Liquid Argon Barrel Calorimeter (EMB) of the ATLAS experiment is longitudinally segmented in four layers, each of them having a different transverse segmentation. Combining the informations from the different samplings in order to optimize the performances is not a straightforward task. In particular, the Presampler (PS) is supposed to improve the energy resolution by accounting, event by event, for the energy lost in the passive material upstream the detector, but some care is needed in order to preserve the detector linearity and uniformity, that are indeed critically dependent on the PS calibration. The same problem is caused by the longitudinal leak, that can also in principle be estimated event by event using the longitudinal segmentation of the detector.

In order to test different energy reconstruction strategies, we used a detailed simulation of the calorimeter in the testbeam configuration, allowing to know for each event the amount of energy deposited in the passive and active parts of the detectors, thus to compute the sampling fraction for electrons and minimum ionizing particles3 in the various detector compartments.

Footnote 3: we use, following the somewhat incorrect common practice, the term _mip_ to mean particles losing energy only by ionization, with energy well beyond the ionization minimum. In practice we simulate 20 GeV muons without tracking the emitted \(\delta\) rays and brems. photons.

This allows to obtain some Montecarlo weights to be applied on the measured energies, that will be compared with the empirical weights that can be obtained, even on real data, by minimizing the resolution.

### Montecarlo productions

The simulation code was based on the Geant4 standalone simulation of the EMB written by G. Parrour and K. Kordas.

The code simulates the full shower development, following all particles having a range larger than 30 \(\mu\)m. The deposited energy in each detector cell can be obtained, as well as the induced current, taking also into account the distortion of the electric field in the accordion structure. Since in the energy-to-current conversion the intercalibration among the accordion layers is lost, some correction factors were applied, obtained by normalizing the current/energy ratio in the regions of uniform electric field, as shown in figure 14.

The main uncertainty in this simulation concerns the quantity of passive material upstream the detector. An estimation is given in table 1, that refers to a beam impinging at \(\eta=0\).

The "far" material is what precedes the last trimming and focusing magnets, i.e. 170 to 40 m upstream the detector. The photons radiated in this material, especially the low-energy ones, have a large probability of being lost. On the contrary, particles emitted in the "close" material are expected to be practically overlapped with the original electrons.

In the standard version of the code used in this analysis, no "far" material and an effective "close" material of 1.04 X\({}_{0}\) were simulated. Events were generatedfor all the 16 energy points available for real data (with statistics about 2 times larger). In order to perform more extensive tests of the reconstruction procedures, we also produced event samples for energies 245, 500 and 900 GeV, and for other 9 \(\eta\) positions, covering the whole range of the barrel module.

Smaller productions were performed with alternative versions of the code, in order to investigate the systematic errors on the calculated weights:

* the range cut was reduced from 30 to 15 \(\mu\)m;
* an upgraded simulation of the PS was used. The main difference is a reduction of the passive material between PS and STRIPS by 2 cm of LAr;
* the upgraded PS simulation, and a more realistic simulation of the upstream material (0.08 X\({}_{0}\) "far" material and 1.11 X\({}_{0}\) "close" material) were used;
* all the material upstream the accordion calorimeter, including the PS, were not simulated in order to study the intrinsic performances of the accordion

detector.

The readout chain and the signal reconstruction are not simulated in the G4 code. We have added to our output data the incoherent electronic noise, as measured in real random events.

### Principles

A possible approach to the reconstruction of the total energy

\(E=\sum_{i}w_{i}E_{i}\)

consists in applying to the measured energies in each compartment \(E_{i}\) some "true" weights \(w_{i}\) defined as the inverse of the sampling fraction for an electron

\[(s.f.)_{e}=\frac{E_{active}^{e}}{E_{active}^{e}+E_{passive}^{e}}\]

These weights preserve the linearity by definition.

Figure 15 shows the energy dependence of the average \((s.f.)_{e}\) for each of the EMB compartments. It can be noted that

* the PS sampling fraction is about 4 times smaller than the accordion one;
* the _s.f._ at a given energy decreases by 2.5 % from the STRIPS to the BACK;
* in each compartment the _s.f._ shows a non-linearity of about 5 %.

This behavior is due to the large number of low-range photons produced in an electromagnetic shower, that are mainly "trapped" in the lead, causing the sampling fraction for an electron to be considerably smaller than that of a _mip_, and to decrease with the depth inside the calorimeter. This is illustrated in figure 16. The simulation predicts e/\(\mu\)=0.793, e/_mip_=0.736 at 100 GeV. The effect depends on the range cutoff used in the simulation. For a cutoff of 15 \(\mu\)m, e/_mip_ is reduced by 0.4 %. However

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|l|r r|} \hline Material & thickness (cm) & (X\({}_{0}\)) \\ \hline \hline air & 950 & 0.03 \\ Mylar windows & 0.2 & 0.01 \\ NA45 & 667 & 0.01 – 0.04 \\ First Cer. counter & 1176 & \(\sim\) 0.01 \\ \hline total “far” material & & \(\sim\) 0.06 – 0.10 \\ \hline scintillators & 4.2 & 0.10 \\ air & 300 & 0.01 \\ windows, beam chambers, 2\({}^{nd}\) Cer. & & 0.01 – 0.03 \\ cryostat walls (Al) & 8.0 & 0.90 \\ foam (Rohacell) & 30 & 0.04 \\ Liquid Argon & 0.2 – 0.5 & 0.01 – 0.04 \\ \hline total “close” material & & \(\sim\) 1.07 – 1.12 \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 1: Estimation of the quantity of material before the Presamplerthis reduction is independent on energy and depth (figure 17), so that the cutoff is not relevant for the linearity.

Figure 16 shows clearly that the _s.f._ at a given absolute position changes with the energy. However, as shown in figure 19, the _s.f._ follows the scaling with energy of the longitudinal profile, i.e. it becomes energy-independent if we normalize the depth to the (energy-dependent) shower maximum. The linearity of the full accordion is indeed much better with respect to each of its compartments, as shown in figure 18. This is related to the fact that the accordion detector has been carefully designed for having a constant \((s.f.)_{mip}\) along the shower path. We expect that if the full shower is contained in such a "longitudinally homogeneous" sampling calorimeter, the average \((s.f.)_{e}\) becomes independent on energy, an intuitive result confirmed by the fact that sampling calorimeters have in general a good linearity!

We also notice that, though the sampling fraction is different for the three accordion compartments on average, it varies event by event according to the fluctuations of the longitudinal profile. This can be seen by looking how \((s.f.)_{e}\), for a given electron energy, changes with the event shower depth (fig. 20), estimated by the

longitudinal energy barycenter

\[d=\frac{4\times E_{PS}\times d_{PS}+\sum_{\ell=1}^{3}E_{\ell}\times d_{\ell}}{4 \times E_{PS}+\sum_{\ell=1}^{3}E_{\ell}}\]

where \(d_{\ell}\) are the depths of the sampling center, expressed in units \(X_{0}\), and the factor 4 accounts for the different _s.f._ of the Presampler.

In fact, the \((s.f.)_{e}\) of each sampling has a strong sensitivity to the longitudinal fluctuations, while for a given depth it weakly depends on the electron energy, especially in the last samplings. If the three accordion samplings are summed with the same weight, the effect of longitudinal fluctuations is reduced.

The residual depth-dependence can be attributed to the presence of the upstream material. To prove this statement, we simulated our accordion detector after removing all the material in front, including the PS (production 5). Figure 21 shows that the depth dependence of the reconstructed energy is strongly reduced, the residual effects being compatible with the effect of longitudinal leakage. On the other side, a residual non-linearity of 0.6 % in the range 10 - 250 GeV is still present (fig. 22). This can be regarded as the intrinsic non-linearity of the accordion design.

The fact that the detector response becomes insensitive to the longitudinal fluctuations makes also the resolution much better than in the case of applying a different "true" weight to each compartment, as shown in figure 23.

This discussion illustrates a well-known general principle (see for example [7]): the most correct way to calibrate a longitudinally segmented sampling calorimeter is to weight the measured energy in each compartment by the inverse of the sampling fraction for a _mip_\((s.f.)_{mip}\). This means in our case that **the same weight should be applied to the three accordion samplings**. Another advantage of this procedure is that the reconstruction is independent on the particle type.

### Including the Presampler

As already mentioned, the PS has a much smaller sampling fraction than the accordion detector, due to the important quantity of passive material upstream the detector. Following the principle stated in the previous section, we should weight the PS signal by the inverse of its _mip_ sampling fraction. There is actually an ambiguity in defining this quantity, since some passive material (PS support structure, electronic cables and boards) is located between the PS and the STRIPS. Depending on how this material is shared between the two, the ratio of the PS and accordion weights should be comprised between 5 and 8. To solve the ambiguity, we can empirically tune this number in order to optimize the detector linearity. Unfortunately, the PS weight of 5.2 that gives the best linearity does not coincide with the one that minimizes the resolution, as shown in figure 25. We interpret this result as due to the enhancing of the large intrinsic sampling fluctuations of the PS, that more than compensate the suppression of longitudinal fluctuations (shown in fig. 24). For the real data (fig. 26) we find an even larger value for the best linearity weight (5.6 rather than 5.2) and, since the electronic noise also contributes, the resolution becomes similar to the case of not using the PS at all!

A more acceptable result can be obtained by turning back to our original approach consisting in weighting with the inverse of \((s.f.)_{e}\). In fact, for the PS the \(e/\mu\)Figure 20: Sampling fraction as a function of event depth for the 4 detector samplings and the full accordion (strips+middle+back), for different electron energies.

ratio is larger than one, thus we can preserve the linearity using smaller weights for the PS (some numbers for the sampling fractions are shown in table 2). We thus reconstruct the energy as

\[E_{rec}=\frac{E_{active}^{PS}}{s.f._{e,PS}}+\frac{E_{active}^{ACC}}{s.f._{\cdot e,ACC}} \tag{1}\]

Since in this case the non-linearity is 0 by definition, the sharing of the passive material between PS and STRIPS has been tuned to optimize the resolution. It turns out that the minimum resolution is obtained by assigning 3/4 of the material to the PS, though the inclusion of the last slice in the passive material of the accordion increases the non-linearity of the accordion sampling fraction.

Let's note that up to now we defined \(E_{active}\) as the energy deposited in the active part of the detector at any transverse position, i.e. the results discussed so far only depend on the physical shower sampling and not on the energy\(\rightarrow\)current conversion and on the clustering. The latter effects must now be included in the effective "true" weights to be applied on the measured cluster energy, that are shown in figure 27.

A price has to be paid for the improvement in resolution:

* the reconstruction becomes specific for electrons;
* a residual dependence on longitudinal fluctuations is left (fig. 24). This effect can be canceled by parameterizing the weights as a function of depth and not only on energy, resulting in a moderate improvement in resolution.

### Correcting for leakage

At \(\eta\) = 0.687 the effect of longitudinal leakage is small, varying from 0.28 % at 10 GeV to 0.52 % at 500 GeV on average. Its average value can be taken into account by rescaling the "true" weights, in order to correct for the effect on linearity.

However, when the average energy leak is of the order of 1 % or more, leakage fluctuations start to affect the energy resolution and the longitudinal detector segmentation should be used to estimate the effect event by event. A simple approach consists in applying a weight to the energy measured in the BACK layer. However, in order to account correctly for the effect (i.e. to preserve the linearity), the weight

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|l|r r r|} \hline Particle & Presampler & Accortion & \((s.f.)_{ACC}/(s.f.)_{PS}\) \\  & \(s.f.\) (\%) & \(s.f.\)(\%) & \\ \hline mips & 3.32 & 23.90 & 7.20 \\ muons & 3.42 & 22.30 & 6.52 \\ \(e^{-}\)\(10GeV\) & 4.58 & 17.60 & 3.84 \\ \(e^{-}\)\(50GeV\) & 4.53 & 17.89 & 3.94 \\ \(e^{-}\)\(100GeV\) & 4.48 & 17.96 & 4.01 \\ \(e^{-}\)\(500GeV\) & 4.30 & 18.07 & 4.20 \\ \(e^{-}\)\(900GeV\) & 4.23 & 18.10 & 4.28 \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 2: Sampling fractions predicted by the simulation for PS and accordion. The material between PS and STRIPS has been shared in proportions 3/4 : 1/4would be energy dependent and its large value would prevent an improvement of the energy resolution, due to the large intrinsic fluctuations of the BACK response (see fig. 28). A more suitable method consists in parameterizing the leakage as a function of the depth. This parametrization is energy-independent to a good approximation (see fig. 29) and would thus depend only on \(\eta\).

Since we showed that our reconstructed energy (1) has a residual dependence on the depth, it is necessary to parametrize the weights as a function of depth in order to make the leakage correction effective.

### The final recipe

To summarize the result of our study on MC data, we will reconstruct the energy through the following steps:

* weight the PS and the Accordion with the inverse of the electron sampling fraction, taking into account its dependence on depth and (more weakly) on energy;
* apply a depth-dependent correction to recover the leaked energy.

In practice, for each energy point the weight are computed in 60 bins of depth between 6 and 16 \(X_{0}\). The non-linearity of this reconstruction on the Montecarlo samples, introduced by the finite bin size and by the residual energy dependence of the leakage correction, is within \(\pm 3\times 10^{-4}\).

Figures 30 and 31 show the resolution improvement of the depth-dependent calibration (a few %) and of the leakage correction (important at high energy).

Figure 27: “True” weights to be applied to the PS and accordion in order to obtain the correct linearity. An arbitrary normalization is used for the absolute energy scale. These effective weights take also into account the energy–to–current conversion (that renders the accordion 10 % less efficient than the PS), the energy lost outside the 3\(\times\)3 clustering and the average longitudinal leakage.

Figure 28: Predicted fraction of energy leakage, and ratio between energy leakage and energy in the active part of the BACK sampling. Error bars show the r.m.s. of the ratios. It is clear that the fluctuations of the BACK response are, at least at low energy, stronger than the leakage fluctuation.

Figure 30: Energy distributions for different ways to reconstruct the energy. In the upper plots the two weights depending only on energy (showed in figure 27) are applied. These weights are normalized in order to account for the average leakage. In the middle plot the depth dependence of the weights is also taken into account, and the leakage is corrected for every event resulting in the lower plot.

### Comparison of weighting methods: linearity, resolution, uniformity

We test now on the simulated data the empirical procedure consisting in computing the weights that minimize the energy resolution. This is a widely used technique, though it is not expected to preserve in general the linearity neither the uniformity since:

* a normalization is needed, i.e. one or more samplings that are weighted 1. As shown in fig. 15, all the samplings show sizable energy non-linearity. The average \(s.f.\) of a given sampling also changes with \(\eta\) due to the varying relative position with respect to the shower maximum;
* the motivation of this method is that the correct weights suppress the fluctuations from the energy sharing among the samplings, i.e. the longitudinal shower fluctuations. However, every sampling is also affected by intrinsic fluctuations, not correlated with the other samplings. If, for example, a sampling is affected by large electronic noise, its weight will be reduced independently on the physical signal.

Figure 32: Weights normalized to the middle layer, obtained by minimizing the resolution on MC and real data, or by the ratio of \((s.f.)_{e}\) (“true” weights).

We have computed the "minimum resolution" weights in three normalization cases:

* the weight for the MIDDLE sampling is set to 1, and the three others are left free;
* weights for MIDDLE and STRIPS set to 1, the others free;
* weights for the accordion samplings set to 1, the PS weight is free.

In the first two cases, weights were computed using the analytical method described in [8] and the code provided by the authors. In the last case, the resolution was minimized using MINUIT.

Figure 32 shows the weights normalized to MIDDLE as a function of energy, obtained from MC and data (for the latter, the electronic noise has been deconvoluted from the resolution before minimization). Also shown are the "true" normalized weights \((s.f.)_{e}^{MIDDLE}/(s.f.)_{e}^{X}\), that differ substantially, especially in the STRIPS and BACK samplings. The weights from MC and data agree reasonably well.

Figures 33 and 34 show the ratio of reconstructed to true energy for the various normalizations and different positions in \(\eta\). The expected performances for linearity and uniformity are summarized in table 3. The results show that no normalization scheme provides at the same time a good linearity and uniformity.

Figures 35-37 compare the resolutions (including noise) for the three empirical weighting schemes, and two schemes based on two "true" weights for PS and accordion:

* 2 "true" weights depending on energy;
* 2 "true" weights depending on energy and depth, leakage corrected event by event.

The minimal resolution, obtained with normalization A, is very close to the one obtained with the "true" weighting, that provides by construction a perfect linearity and uniformity.

## 4 Reconstruction effects affecting linearity

### Readout non-linearity

The linearity of the readout chain can be probed and corrected using the calibration ramps. During the data-taking, calibration runs were taken regularly, in which the average ADC response of each channel was measured for several values of the input calibration signal (that will be expressed in units of DAC counts). In the energy range of interest, two electronic gains, Hi and Medium, were used, the transition between the two corresponding to an energy of about 30 GeV for the middle compartment (about 50 GeV for the cluster).

An unknown offset of the input signal is present, due to:

* the uncertainty on the voltage threshold needed to polarize the output transistor of the calibration line;
* a spurious contribution to the calibration current, the so-called "injected current";

For this reason, the standard calibration procedure used so far is based on some assumptions:

* the injected current is independent on the DAC amplitude, thus the ADC value measured for a very small DAC value (DAC=10) is subtracted in each time sample from the ADC average response at any DAC value;
* the response of the readout chain is linear at small ADC values;

Thus, the DAC vs ADC curve is fitted with a second degree polynomial, but the intercept of the fit is not used in the reconstruction, assuming that is biased by the cited effects. The quadratic term of the fit accounts for a saturation effect at the largest ADC values (\(~{}\hbox to 0.0pt{\lower 2.5pt\hbox{$\sim$}}\raise 1.5pt\hbox{$>$}\ 2000\)).

Figure 38 shows the typical deviation from linearity of a calibration ramp for the medium and high gains. A non linearity is clearly present in the medium gain at low energy.

In order to check that the non-linearity is not introduced by the calibration, we used a series of special "delay" runs, allowing to reconstruct the signal shape for several DAC values in 1 ns steps. Several observations lead us to the conclusion that the non-linearity comes from the readout chain:

* the non-linearity is reproduced by fitting the peaks of the signal shapes in the "delay" runs (thus, there is no bias from the 40 MHz sampling);
* the signal shapes don't suggest large variations of the injected current signal, though the change of shape and time drift of the signal with DAC prevents to give precise estimates; nevertheless, even in the pessimistic hypothesis that the injected current varies between 0 and twice the measured value at low DAC, the non-linearity persists (figure 39);* for a given DAC value, the shapes at medium and high gain agree very well, except for their amplitudes and a small (\(\sim\) 2 ns) time shift. This two parameters can obtained from a fit (see fig. 40). The gain ratio, that is independent on the input signal, exhibits a dependence on DAC, showing that in at least one of the two gains the response is not linear.

We conclude that the non-linearity observed in the calibration is a real effect that must be taken into account in the ramp fits. In the medium gain range (DAC from 2000 to 20000), the fits give large values of the intercepts (10-40 DAC counts) due to the non-linearity. If the intercept is not used in the reconstruction, we can expect distortion up to 2 %, as shown in figure 42. On the other side, the use of the intercepts makes our calibration sensitive to the unknown DAC offset cited above. However, the ramp fits at low DAC suggest that the effect should be within about 1 DAC counts, so the latter solution is less biased.

Finally, a cross-check can be done on the physics data, by comparing the energy reconstructed in every channel with the two gains, that are both recorded. Figure 43 shows that the using the standard fit a 1 % mismatch between the two energy values is tipically observed in the middle layer cells, producing a discontinuity at the gain switch.

For our analysis, we used some special calibrations runs (220132 and 220133 for medium and high gain, respectively) were many points were available, notably in the low DAC region for the medium gain, and we fitted the curves with a 5th degree polynomial, forcing the intercept to be 0. The gain switch using this calibration is

Figure 40: Example of fit of the ratio between the signal shapes obtained for a given DAC value at medium and high gains. The gain ratio is shown to be time independent as expected, if a time shift is allowed between the two curves.

Figure 42: The points in the plot show the residuals, in DAC units, of a linear one–parameter fit of the calibration ramps, for the MIDDLE layer cell centered during the test beam. The upper plot is for high gain, the lower one for medium gain. The full black points are from a standard calibration run; the black curve shows the result of the standard fit (3–parameters) to those points, while the blue curve is the one used in the default reconstruction (intercept set to zero). The open points, obtained from special calibration runs, show that the residuals are due to a non–linearity rather than a global offset. Thus, if the blue curve is used in the reconstruction, we expect the calibration curve to be biased by about 2 DAC counts for high gain (range 0–2000) and about 20 DAC counts for medium gain (range 2000–20000). The red curve is the result of our 5–parameter fit to the open points.

kept within 0.1 %, as shown in figure 43.

The effect on the linearity due to the new calibration is showed in figure 44.

### Cross-talk

The electronic calibration allows in principle to intercalibrate the different samplings. However, the calibration ramps do not take into account the signal that is transmitted through cross-talk to the neighbor channels of the pulsed one. As in the physics events this cross-talked energy will be mainly recovered in the clustering, the cluster energy will be overestimated. The effect is different for the four layers due to their different segmentation, resulting in a bad intercalibration of the compartments. The cross-talk among channels of the same layer is indeed relevant only for the STRIPS, where a large capacitive coupling is present between the adjacent cells in \(\eta\). The effect can be measured in the calibration data, by resumming in each time sample the signal recorded in the pulsed channel and its neighbors before

Figure 43: Ratio between the energy measured in the two gains for all cells of the MIDDLE compartment for 180 GeV electrons. In the upper plot the standard calibrations are applied, while in the lower one our 5–parameter fit is used. The gain is switched in the region 20–25 GeV where the black and red histograms overlap.

reconstructing the peak amplitude. However, this procedure is affected by some uncertainties:

* since the cross-talk signal has a different (\(\sim\) derivative) shape than the primary signal, the effect on the signal peak critically depends on the reconstruction method. If the peak amplitude is reconstructed with a simple parabolic fit, it increases on average by 10 % (5 % for each side) after the resummation (the average is made on the channels in the 3x3 clustering region used in the linearity runs). However, in the physics data the signal is reconstructed with an optimal filtering method. The most similar (but not exactly equivalent) method available for the calibration in EMTB, based on the calibration shapes obtained with the delay runs[9], gives an average effect of 6.5 %;
* since the cross-talk depends on the voltage different between neighbors, the average effect in the physics data, where all the channels around the maximum have some physical signal over than the cross-talk, is in general different from calibration. We assume here that the total cluster signal is independent by the quantity of cross-talk.

To account for the average effect, we reduce the STRIPS energy by 6.5 %, and we estimate an absolute 1 % error on this correction.

### Pedestals

Pedestal values are measured during special runs and applied in the following physics runs. The stability of the pedestals can be checked using random events taken along the physics runs. An instability, especially in the Presampler, is observed, with a non negligible effect on the reconstructed energy. Thus, for each run the pedestals were recomputed from the random events. No instability was spotted within any

given run. With respect to using the closest pedestal run, the reconstructed energy is biased by about 20 MeV (fig. 45).

Figure 46: Ratio of full deposited energy and cluster energy according to the MC simulation, for 3x3 and 5x5 clustering.

Figure 45: Effect on linearity of the pedestal updating using random events in each run.

### Clustering

The cluster used in our analysis is built starting from the MIDDLE compartment, where the energy is collected in a square area of 3x3 cells around the highest-energy cell. For the other compartments, all the cells included fully or partly in the geometrical projection of this square are considered, with the exception of the STRIPS in the \(\eta\) direction, due to its finer segmentation. In this case, the maximum is found and 10 cells on each side are added.4

Footnote 4: note that this algorithm is similar, but not totally equivalent, to the default EMTB clustering. In the G4 standalone MC, the algorithm is the same except for the STRIPS, where the full projection is included in the cluster.

The energy lost outside the cluster is estimated from the MC simulation, that predicts that the effect on the linearity would be 0.7 % (0.3 %) in the range 10 (30) to 180 GeV if the effect was not taken into account at all. The uncertainty on the correction is thus expected to be well within 0.1 %.

### Geometrical corrections

Since the energy response depends on the impact position of the particle within the cell, the different shape of the beam in each run (and in the MC samples, where an uniform illumination of the whole cell surface was simulated) can bias the measurement of the average beam energy. To a good approximation, the response dependence on \(\eta\) and \(\phi\) can be factorized. Only events with a measured barycenter within the cell boundary were considered. Then, the energy response where corrected for its dependence on \(\eta\) and \(\phi\), renormalizing the average energy to the center of the cell. This correction was optimized for the 3x3 clustering.

The same procedure was applied on the MC data, and its effect was used to rescale the MC weights. However, the correction on MC data amounts to \(1.006\pm.001\) and shows, within the errors, no dependence on energy.

Figure 47: Change of the average reconstructed energy after reducing the maximum distance in \(\eta\) and \(\phi\) between the barycenter and the cell center from 0.5 to 0.3 MIDDLE cell size.

The systematic effect from the geometrical effects was estimated by applying a stricter cut (\(|\Delta\eta|<0.0075,|\Delta\phi|<0.0075\)) against the beam halo. The effect, showed in figure 47, is within 0.1 %.

### Pion contamination

A large scintillator following the detector was used as a pion veto. A residual pion contamination is clearly present from the low-energy tails of the total energy distributions. A cut based on the transverse shower profile was applied to suppress the hadrons: for each cell the energy fraction

\[f_{i}=E_{i}/E_{layer}\]

was parametrized, for electrons in a narrow energy window around the peak, as a function of the distance from the cluster barycenter5 (see fig. 48). For each event we compute a \(\chi^{2}\) that quantifies the compatibility of the transverse profile with the average electromagnetic one:

Footnote 5: the barycenter is measured in the STRIPS for \(\eta\) and in the MIDDLE for \(\phi\); the deviation from projectivity of the particle trajectory is neglected.

\[\chi^{2}=\frac{1}{N-3}\sum_{cells}^{layer=0,2}\frac{\left(E_{i}/E_{layer}-f_{ l}(\Delta\eta,\Delta\phi)\right)^{2}}{\sigma_{f_{l}}^{2}(\Delta\eta,\Delta\phi)}\]

Figure 48: Measured transverse energy profile in the four compartments. The scales are expressed in cell units, the range corresponding in all cases to \(\Delta\eta=0.075,\Delta\phi=0.0736\).

(where we number of _dof_ is N-3, since the first three layers give the bounds \(\sum E_{i}=E_{layer}\), and the last layer is not used due to its poor contribution to the signal).

We stress that this \(\chi^{2}\) variable only depends on the transverse shower shape, and is independent on the total measured energy. Figure 50 shows how a cut on this quantity is effective against the pion contamination. We applied a cut varying from 3.5 at 10 GeV to 2.5 at 180 GeV, in order to keep an high efficiency for the signal. The effect of this cut on the reconstructed energy is shown in figure 49.

The profile parameterization can also be used to recover the energy missed in a dead cell. In the linearity scan only one dead cell was included in our clustering region (PS cell i\(\eta\)=28, i\(\phi\)=2), containing on average a few % of the PS energy. Recovering the average energy lost in the cell corrects an effect on the linearity smaller than 0.1 %.

### Upstream Energy losses

Figure 50 shows that a small tail in the total energy distribution persists even after a strong cut against the hadron contamination. This suggests that this close tail is due to real electrons. As mentioned in section 3.1, some material present along the beam line far away from the detector could produce an energy loss via bremsstrahlung. In order to check this hypothesis, we added a bremsstrahlung loss to our MC sample through a toy Montecarlo and we tuned the quantity of material for the best agreement with real data. Figure 51 shows that the tails are rather well reproduced at all energies with a material corresponding to 0.08 \(X_{0}\). This is compatible with the (though somewhat uncertain) estimate of the material given in section 3.1. The convolution of this energy loss with the resolution can produce an energy-dependent bias, i.e. an effect on the linearity. The effect is reduced by fitting the signal peak in a asymmetric region between -0.5 and 3.0 \(\sigma\) (figure 52).

We evaluated the residual effect using our toy Montecarlo. The fluctuations of the bias were obtained by simulating 100 experiments with the same statistics as real data for each energy point. The computed correction and its error is shown in figure 53: the maximum non-linearity is 0.2 % with errors of about 0.05 %.

Figure 50: The upper plot shows the distribution of the \(\chi^{2}\) variable described in the text for 180 GeV electrons. The effect of a cut on this quantity on the distributions of the total and PS energy are also shown.

Results

In this section we will show a comparison of the real and simulated data, and estimate a systematic error on the Montecarlo weights. Finally, the linearity and resolution obtained after applying the recipes and corrections discussed in the previous sections will be presented.

### Data/MC comparisons

The real and MC energy distributions in the four compartments are compared in figures 54 and 55, showing a satisfactory agreement after adjusting two parameters:

* the global energy scale, corresponding to a calibration factor for real data of 2.46 \(\mu\)A/GeV for the accordion at 100 GeV;6 Footnote 6: in real data a common current–to–energy conversion factor is applied to all samplings, before applying the weights computed with MC. The default EMTB behavior is thus overridden by setting all the CARD_FUDGE_XXX factors to the same value.
* the cross-talk between the MIDDLE and BACK samplings (0.5 % of the MIDDLE signal).

As shown in fig. 51, the distributions of the total reconstructed energy agree only after adding in the simulation an ad-hoc bremsstrahlung loss.

The longitudinal fluctuations are also very well reproduced (fig 56), and the tricky depth dependence of the reconstructed energy (using the 2 weights depending only on energy) is also confirmed on real data (fig. 57).

Finally, the \(\eta\) and \(\phi\) projection of the transverse profile are compared in figures 58 and 59. The \(\eta\) profile in the STRIPS is wider in the data, but the agreement is improved (though not yet very good) after accounting for the 6.5 % cross-talk effect. The cross-talk between MIDDLE and BACK (which dominates the BACK signal) has not been accounted for at cell level in the simulation.

The other "control" MC productions listed in section 3.1 show a worse agreement with real data in the longitudinal profiles. This is an indication that the passive material of the default production is accurate at the level of 0.1 \(X_{0}\) (half the difference in close passive material between prod1 and prod4).

The systematic error on linearity from the MC weights will thus be estimated as half the largest difference between the results obtained with different production. As shown in figure 60, the error is largest at 10 GeV (0.3 %) and becomes negligible at the highest energy.

### Linearity and resolution

We summarize now the errors on the linearity measurement. The statistical errors on each point are obtained by adding in quadrature

* the error from the asymmetric gaussian fit of the energy distribution;
* the error on the bremsstrahlung correction showed in figure 53 that is also of statistical nature.

* the 1 % error on the cross-talk correction. Since the fraction of STRIPS energy varies from 41 % at 10 GeV to 20 % at 180 GeV, the effect on the linearity in this range is about 0.2 %;
* the error from the uncertainty on MC weights as discussed in section 5.1, of about 0.15 %;
* an error of 0.1 % on all the points from the uncertainty on the correction of geometrical effects;
* an error of 0.1 % on all the points from the residual pion contamination;
* an uncertainty on the energy scale of 11 MeV due to the residual field in the B4 magnets, as discussed in section 2.4.

The final result for the linearity is shown in figure 61, where the points have been normalized to 100 GeV. The systematic uncertainty is 0.3 % at 10 GeV and 0.15 % at high energy. Most of the measured value are well within the systematic band. We stress here that the systematic error of all the points is largely correlated, since several effects (cross-talk, MC weights, B4 magnets) can induce a slope. Though there is no evidence for such a slope, we keep our a-priori estimation of the systematic error, since an accidental cancellation among different effects cannot be excluded.

The result for the resolution is shown in figure 62, where we also compare the performances of our MC-based reconstruction with other weighting schemes (to be compared with the analogous plot for MC data in figure 35). Even in the case of real data the resolution is very close to the minimal one, and the improvement due to the depth-dependent weights is also confirmed.

Conclusions

In this note we measured the linearity of a LAr Barrel Calorimeter module between 10 and 180 GeV after studying in general the most appropriate sampling weighting procedure allowing for satisfactory linearity, uniformity and resolution at the same time. Several other effects relevant for the linearity were also addressed.

Though the effect on linearity of the knowledge of beam energy can be controlled at the level of a few \(10^{-4}\), the result shows that the linearity cannot be measured to better than 0.2 % with our current understanding of the detector. This result can likely be improved through a better modeling of some detector features, notably the cross-talk in the STRIPS and through the improvement of the MC simulation, essential for a proper intercalibration of the detector samplings, in particular of the Presampler relatively to the accordion part. This could be achieved in a future measurement by a better knowledge of the material along the beam line. Energy scans at different \(\eta\) positions could be very useful to validate the simulation and rendering it more reliable.

The measurements show that, after taking all corrections into account, the detector is linear within the estimated accuracy. In particular in the region between 30 and 80 GeV, important for the measurement of the W mass, the measured non-linearity is within \(\pm 5\cdot 10^{-4}\).

### Acknowledgments

Many discussion and suggestions from my Orsay colleagues, and in particular by Daniel Fournier and Laurent Serin, were essential throughout all this work. The work and the nice advice of Samira Hassani provided the basis on which this analysis started.

The measurement of the beam energy was possible thanks to the kind collaboration of Ilias Efthymiopoulos.

The study of layer weighting through MC simulation was possible through the support of Gaston Parrour, and profited of useful discussions with Tancredi Carli, Marcello Fanti, Marco Del Mastro, Lucia di Ciaccio and Fabiola Gianotti.
