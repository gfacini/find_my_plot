###### Abstract

We have studied a 300 GeV/\(c^{2}\) Standard Model Higgs produced by W boson fusion and decaying into H \(\rightarrow\) WW \(\rightarrow\ell\nu\)jj using the ATLAS detector. We show that this channel can be used for discovery using 30 fb\({}^{-1}\) of data at low luminosity running of the LHC. For the first time, looking at this channel, the signal mass peak is reconstructed, and a signal significance of S/\(\sqrt{\rm B}=12.9\) is obtained.

## 1 Introduction

The _golden_ Standard Model (SM) Higgs discovery channel at the LHC is H \(\rightarrow\) ZZ \(\rightarrow\) 4\(\ell\) for masses in the range \(2m_{Z}<m_{H}<650\) GeV/\(c^{2}\). The four lepton signature is easily observable thanks to the ATLAS electromagnetic calorimeter and to efficient muon detection. Nonetheless, it is useful to study other channels in order to confirm the discovery as well as to give additional information about this Higgs, such as its couplings. This is what motivated our study of a SM Higgsproduced by vector boson fusion (VBF) subsequently decaying into \({\rm H}\to{\rm WW}\to\ell\nu{\rm jj}\).

The vector boson fusion cross-section is the second highest, after gluon fusion. The \({\rm qq}\to{\rm qqVV}\) events are characterized by two jets with large rapidity separation in addition to the decay particles of the final state. These forward jets are used to tag the event, which helps to reduce the background. Previous studies (see Ref. [1, 2]) have shown that the Higgs is detectable for \(m_{\rm H}\geq 600\) GeV/\(\it{c}^{2}\) using the \({\rm H}\to{\rm WW}\to\ell\nu{\rm jj}\) and \({\rm H}\to{\rm ZZ}\to\ell\ell{\rm jj}\) channels. For \(m_{\rm H}\geq 300\) GeV/\(\it{c}^{2}\), we will see that the signal is more difficult to exploit.

## 2 Reminder of the ATLAS TDR study

The previous \({\rm H}\to{\rm WW}\) study for \(m_{\rm H}\geq 300\) GeV/\(\it{c}^{2}\) is described in the ATLAS Technical Design Report (see Ref. [2, 3]) and the result is summarized in Figure 1. The invariant mass distribution \(m_{\ell\nu{\rm jj}}\) is shown for the background

Figure 1: Background (shaded) and signal+background (points with error bars) \(m_{\ell\nu jj}\) distributions for the \({\rm H}\to{\rm WW}\to\ell\nu{\rm jj}\) channel with \(m_{\rm H}=300\) GeV/\(\it{c}^{2}\) and \(30\) fb\({}^{-1}\)[2].

(shaded) and for the signal+background (points with error bars), for an integrated luminosity of 30 fb\({}^{-1}\). Both distributions peak at around the same mass and make it impossible to reconstruct the signal mass peak. This is thus a counting experiment and the ratio of signal to background events as well as the signal significance are respectively: S/B=0.192 and S/\(\sqrt{\rm B}=\)6.2. There remain large uncertainties concerning the backgrounds, more specifically the W+jets, which makes this study sensitive to systematics. Hence this study has shown that one can at best confirm a discovery made in the ZZ channel for a 300 GeV/\(\it{c}^{2}\) SM Higgs.

## 3 Signal and background

The lowest order Feynman diagram for the signal is shown in Figure 2. The final state consists of four jets and one lepton. In the ATLAS TDR, for \(m_{\rm H}=300\) GeV/\(\it{c}^{2}\), this channel has a signal significance approximately four times smaller than the ZZ \(\rightarrow\) 4\(\ell\) channel but sufficiently large (S/\(\sqrt{\rm B}>5\)) to contribute to the discovery. The three main backgrounds are:

* W bosons associated with \(n\) jets i.e. Wjj (see Figure 3), with W \(\rightarrow\ell\nu\) and where the invariant mass of two of the remaining jets happens to be close to the W boson mass.
* Top pairs i.e. t\(\bar{\rm t}\) (see Figure 4) with each top decaying into Wb. One W subsequently decays into \(\ell\nu\), the other into two jets.
* W pairs i.e.continuum WW (see Figure 5) with one W decaying into \(\ell\nu\) and the other into jj.

The Wjj background is the most important one with a cross section one order of magnitude larger than the t\(\bar{\rm t}\), but both processes are reducible. The WW

continuum contributes very little to the overall background, with a cross section two orders of magnitude smaller than the Wjj (see Table 1).

### Signal signature

In vector boson fusion (see Figure 2), the two VBF jets (i.e. which do not come from the Higgs decay) are used to tag the signal. The W bosons have an energy of the order of \(m_{\rm H}c^{2}/2\) such that a Higgs can be produced, and so the VBF jets are very energetic \(E_{\rm j}\sim 600\) GeV (see Figure 6 top left). As well, the transverse momentum transfered to the W bosons is relatively small \(p_{t}\sim m_{\rm W}c\) such that the VBF jets are emitted at a small angle in regions of large pseudo-rapidity (see Figure 6). Also, these jets have an invariant mass of the order of the TeV (see Figure 6 bottom right).

Another interesting feature of vector boson fusion is that the initial quarks interact via exchange of a colour singlet which translates into the absence of hadronic activity in the central region. For most background processes, this is not the case, making it interesting for background reduction. Finally, the \(\rm qq\to qqH\) process mostly produces a central Higgs, as shown in Figure 7, with its decay products preferentially in the central region of the detector (see Figures 8). The selection cuts will be described in Sections 4 and 5.

### Simulation and reconstruction

The signal and backgrounds were produced using PYTHIA 6.203 (see Ref. [4]). No kinematic cuts were applied at generation level for the signal, while for the background, a cut on the transverse momentum in the center of mass of the hard process \(P_{t}^{h}>50\) GeV/\(c\) was applied. Table 1 lists the cross sections for the signal and background using PYTHIA 6.203 for \(m_{\rm H}=300\) GeV/\(c^{2}\). Vector boson fusion is simulated by the process \(ISUB=123\) (WW fusion) and 124 (ZZ fusion). The W boson was forced to decay into \(\mu\nu\), and the cross sections were doubled to

take into account the e\(\nu\) decay. The fragmentation and the initial and final state radiation (ISR and FSR) were turned on (KEYHAD=3 for PYTHIA 6.203). The CTEQ5L (see Ref. [5]) structure functions were used. Event reconstruction was done using the ATLFAST 2.60 package (see Ref. [6]):

* MAKCLU for jet reconstruction.
* MAKMUO for muon identification and reconstruction.
* MAKMIS for the determination of the missing energy.

The routine ATLFAST-B (see Ref. [6]) was used to rescale the energy-momentum of jets. The need for rescaling comes from the fact that the jet is reconstructed using a cone algorithm. It calculates the jet energy as being the energy deposited inside a certain cone, which does not necessarily contain the whole jet. These results represent purely fast simulation estimates. In particular (because of comparison with TDR results) they have not been corrected for the forward jet-tagging efficiencies, as estimated in Ref. [7]. The 90 % lepton reconstruction efficiency has been included as in previous ATLAS studies.

## 4 Standard analysis

The detector is divided into two regions. This is motivated by the shape of the VBF jets pseudo-rapidity distribution at generation level (see Figure 9). The jets are situated at large \(\eta\) while the Higgs and its decay products are produced in the central region of the detector. The analysis is split into two set of cuts: the central cuts and the VBF jet cuts.

### Central cuts

The following central cuts associated to the leptonically decaying W are applied:

* At least one isolated lepton with \(p_{T}^{\ell}>25\) GeV/\(c\) and \(|\eta_{\ell}|<2\). When more than one lepton is found, the one with the highest momentum is selected.
* Missing transverse momentum associated to the neutrino: \(p_{t}^{\rm miss}>25\) GeV/\(c\).
* Transverse momentum associated to the leptonically decaying W: \(p_{t}^{\ell\nu}>50\) GeV/\(c\).

The cuts on \(p_{T}^{\ell}\), \(p_{t}^{\rm miss}\) and \(p_{t}^{\ell\nu}\) are illustrated in Figures 10. We then apply cuts associated to the hadronically decaying W:

* At least two jets in the central region \(|\eta_{\rm j}|<2\). If more than two jets are found, the ones with the highest transverse momentum are chosen.
* Transverse momentum associated to the hadronically decaying W: \(p_{t}^{\rm j1j2}>50\) GeV/_c_.
* Angular separation of the jets \[\Delta{\rm R}_{\rm j1j2}=\sqrt{(\eta_{\rm j1,W}-\eta_{\rm j2,W})^{2}+(\Phi_{ \rm j1,W}-\Phi_{\rm j2,W})^{2}}<1.8\.\]
* Dijet invariant mass associated to the hadronic W within \(\pm 10\) GeV/_c\({}^{2}\)_ of the W nominal mass \(m_{\rm W}=80.45\) GeV/_c\({}^{2}\)_.

The cuts are illustrated in Figures 10. In particular, the dijet invariant mass cut removes a large part of the Wjj background.

Finally, one last central cut is applied: all events which have more than one central jet other than the jets associated to the hadronic W, which satisfy \(|\eta_{\rm j}|<2\) and \(p_{T}^{\rm j}>20\) GeV/_c_, are rejected. This cut, which is named the **Jet Veto** cut, is illustrated in Figure 11 and rejects a large part of the \(\rm t\bar{t}\) background.

**Higgs reconstruction**

A Higgs candidate invariant mass is determined using the lepton and the missing momentum associated to the leptonic W, and the dijet system associated

Figure 9: Pseudo-rapidity distribution of the VBF jets at generation level. The detetctor is divided following this distribution: the center is defined by \(\eta\in[-2;2]\) and the forward regions by \(\eta\in[-5;-2[\ \cup\ ]2;5]\).

The distributions are normalized to 1.

to the hadronic W. The missing transverse momentum of the event is associated to the transverse momentum of the neutrino. Its longitudinal momentum is determined by constraining the invariant mass of the \(\ell\nu\) system to the W mass. A second degree equation is obtained which has the following two solutions:

\[p_{z,\nu}=\frac{1}{2p_{t,\ell}^{2}}\left[p_{z,\ell}(m_{\rm W}^{2}+2\overrightarrow {p}_{t,\ell}.\overrightarrow{p}_{t,\nu})\pm E_{\ell}\sqrt{(m_{\rm W}^{2}+2 \overrightarrow{p}_{t,\ell}.\overrightarrow{p}_{t,\nu})^{2}-4p_{t,\nu}^{2}p_{ t,\ell}^{2}}\;\right]. \tag{1}\]

The smallest value solution is chosen since it reproduces best the PYTHIA 6.203 generated value (see Figure 12).

### VBF jet cuts

The two VBF jets are chosen as follows:

* They must be in the forward region of the detector: \(2<|\eta_{\rm j}|<5\).
* They are found in opposite hemispheres: \(\eta_{\rm j1}\times\eta_{\rm j2}<0\).
* If more than two jets pass the cuts above, the ones with the highest transverse momentum are chosen.

We then study the effect of three different cuts on the selected VBF jets:

* The energy of the jets: \(E_{\rm j}>E_{\rm threshold}\).

Figure 11: Distribution of the number of central jets (\(|\eta_{\rm j}|<2\)), other than the hadronic W jets, with transverse momentum greater than 20 GeV/_c_.

* The pseudo-rapidity separation of the jets: \(|\Delta\eta_{\rm j1j2}|>\Delta\eta_{\rm threshold}\).
* The invariant mass of the jets: \(m_{\rm j1j2}>M_{\rm threshold}\).

The distributions associated with the cuts are shown in Figures 13.

Table 2 gives for 30 \({\rm fb}^{-1}\) the number of signal events, the signal to background ratio S/B and the signal significance S/\(\sqrt{\rm B}\) after all central cuts have been applied, for each VBF cut taken individually. The Higgs candidate invariant mass has not been determined yet. The background composition is given in Table 3 for each VBF cut taken individually. The signal+background and background distributions still peak at more or less the same mass (see Figures 14 and 15). It is not yet possible to reconstruct the signal mass peak.

The shape of the background distributions do not change when we reduce the cut applied on the transverse momentum in the center of mass of the hard process from \(P_{t}^{h}>50\) GeV/_c_ down to 30 GeV/_c_. The additional background contributes only very slightly to the total background (of the order of the % for \({\rm t}\bar{\rm t}\)).

## 5 Optimization of the analysis

In the hope that the signal peak will separate itself from the background in the Higgs candidate invariant mass distribution, a more global approach is investi

### Global approaches

Two approaches are investigated and they are defined as _global_, since the detector is not divided into two definite geometrical regions as is done in the previous section. For each event, VBF jets are searched for, and the _central_ region of the detector is then defined as the one delimited by the VBF candidate jets: \([\eta_{\rm j,min}+0.6;\eta_{\rm j,max}-0.6]\). The central cuts remain the same as for the standard analysis, except that the jet veto cut is applied in the region \([\eta_{\rm j,min};\eta_{\rm j,max}]\).

#### 5.1.1 Global approach 1

In this approach, the VBF jets are searched for first. They are more energetic than the W jets (as can be seen in see Figure 16 left). The VBF jets are thus selected as follows:

* Pseudo-rapidity separation of the jets must be large: \(|\eta_{\rm j1j2}|>4.2\).
* The jets must be in opposite hemispheres: \(\eta_{\rm j1}\times\eta_{\rm j2}<0\).
* The pair of jets with the highest energies are chosen.

A cut on the VBF jets invariant mass is then applied: \(m_{\rm j1j2}>M_{\rm threshold}\) (see Figure 16 right).

The Higgs candidate invariant mass distributions (\(m_{\ell\nu{\rm jj}}\)) for signal and for background are shown in Figures 17, for different values of the cut on the VBF jets invariant mass. From the results given in Table 4 and from the shape of the distributions in Figures 17, the cut \(M_{\rm threshold}=800\) GeV/\(\,c^{2}\) is chosen. Nonetheless, the signal and background distributions still peak at around the same mass.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|} \hline
**Cuts** & **Wjj** & **t\(\bar{\bf t}\)** & **WW** \\ \hline \hline \({\bf E_{threshold}=600}\) GeV & \(\sim 59\) \% & \(\sim 40\) \% & \(<1\) \% \\ \hline \(\mathbf{\Delta\eta}_{\rm threshold}=\mathbf{6.0}\) & \(\sim 71\) \% & \(\sim 28\) \% & \(<1\) \% \\ \hline \({\bf M_{threshold}=800}\) GeV/\(\,c^{2}\) & \(\sim 57\) \% & \(\sim 42\) \% & \(<1\) \% \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 3: Background composition for the standard analysis, after cuts on the VBF jets and before determination of the Higgs candidate invariant mass (\(m_{\ell\nu{\rm jj}}\)), for \(30\) fb\({}^{-1}\).

Similarly to the standard analysis, the additional background remains negligible when reducing the hard cut from \(P_{t}^{h}>50\) GeV/_c_ down to 30 GeV/_c_. Table 5 gives the composition of the background after the VBF jets invariant mass cut. The Wjj background clearly dominates.

The VBF jets energy is highly correlated with the pseudo-rapidity. Figure 18 clearly illustrates this correlation and a cut on the energy of the jets is in the end equivalent to a cut on their pseudo-rapidity. This fact has motivated the second global approach.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|} \hline
**Cuts** & **Signal** & **S/B** & \(\mathbf{S}/\sqrt{\mathbf{B}}\) \\ \hline \hline \(\mathbf{M_{threshold}=600\;\mathrm{GeV}/\mathit{c}^{2}}\) & 641 & 0.088 & 7.5 \\ \hline \(\mathbf{M_{threshold}=800\;\mathrm{GeV}/\mathit{c}^{2}}\) & 543 & 0.12 & 8.0 \\ \hline \(\mathbf{M_{threshold}=1000\;\mathrm{GeV}/\mathit{c}^{2}}\) & 447 & 0.14 & 7.9 \\ \hline \(\mathbf{M_{threshold}=1200\;\mathrm{GeV}/\mathit{c}^{2}}\) & 364 & 0.17 & 7.8 \\ \hline \end{tabular}

#### 5.1.2 Global approach 2

In this approach, the hadronic W jets are identified first, then the VBF jets are searched for. The W jets are selected such that their invariant mass is closest to the nominal W mass. The VBF jets must satisfy the following criteria:

* The largest invariant mass.
* Large pseudo-rapidity separation: \(|\eta_{\rm j1j2}|>4.2\).
* The two jets are in opposite hemispheres: \(\eta_{\rm j1}\times\eta_{\rm j2}<0\).

The central region and the jet veto cut are defined as in approach 1. The cut on the VBF jets invariant mass is \(m_{\rm j1j2}>800\) GeV/\(c^{2}\).

In this case, the additional backgrounds when reducing the hard cut from \(P_{t}^{h}>50\) GeV/\(c\) down to 30 GeV/\(c\) play a determining role in modifying the shape of the distributions (see Figure 19. We start to distinguish the signal peak from the background. As well, the ratios S/B and S/\(\sqrt{\rm B}\) given in Table 6 are enhanced when comparing the approaches 1 and 2. The background composition after the VBF jets invariant mass cut is given in Table 7. Once again, the Wjj background dominates. This second approach seems very encouraging.

### Additional rejection of the background

In the hope that the signal peak will separate itself even more from the background without reducing the signal significance, two new cuts are investigated.

Figure 18: Correlation between the pseudo-rapidity and the VBF jets energy at generation level.

**Cut in the \((\Delta{\rm R}_{\rm min},\Delta{\rm R}_{\rm max})\) plane**

This cut was inspired from a previous analysis done by Cavasinni et al. (see Ref. [10]), where the following variable is used:

\[\Delta{\rm R}=\sqrt{(\eta_{\ell}-\eta_{\rm j,W})^{2}+(\Phi_{\ell}-\Phi_{\rm j,W })^{2}}\]

corresponding to the angular separation between the lepton and each W jet. \(\Delta{\rm R}_{\rm min}\) and \(\Delta{\rm R}_{\rm max}\) are the minimal and maximal values. The behaviour of the signal (\(m_{\rm H}=130,160,200\) GeV/\(\it{c}^{2}\)) and backgrounds in the \((\Delta{\rm R}_{\rm min},\Delta{\rm R}_{\rm max})\) plane are shown in Figures 20[10]. The same plots are shown in Figures 21 for a 300 GeV/\(\it{c}^{2}\) Higgs in the framework of approach 2. Unfortunately, as the Higgs mass increases any \(\Delta{\rm R}\) cut becomes less efficient in reducing the background, as can be seen from the results in Table 8, therefore this type of cut is not interesting for a higher mass Higgs.

**Cut on \(\bf{m}_{\rm Wj}\)**

Inspired by the diploma thesis of A-S.Nicollerat (see Ref. [11]), a cut on the invariant mass of the hadronic W plus an additional jet (Wj) is applied, very

similar to our jet veto cut on the additional central jets. Both these cuts aim to reduce the \(\mathrm{t\bar{t}}\) background. The Wj invariant mass is calculated for all jets available, and the combination with the invariant mass closest to the top mass (\(m_{\mathrm{t}}=174.3\)\(\mathrm{GeV}/\mathit{c}^{2}\)) is kept.The cut value is extracted from Figure 22.

The efficiencies of the Wj invariant mass cut and of the jet veto cut are given in Table 9. The first cut is efficient in reducing the Wjj and WW backgrounds, while the jet veto cut is much more efficient in reducing the \(\mathrm{t\bar{t}}\) background (4.7% against 36.5%). If the Wj and jet veto cuts are not too correlated, it is worth investigating the combination of both. This is actually done in Section 5.4.

Table 10 lists the number of signal, Wjj and \(\mathrm{t\bar{t}}\) events, as well as the S/B and \(\mathrm{S/\sqrt{B}}\) ratios, after the Wj invariant mass cut and after the jet veto cut. The jet veto cut definitely gives a better signal significance.

### Loosening the cuts

For global approach 2 (see Section 5.1.2) the signal peak starts to separate itself from the background. In order to exploit this effect, the lepton and hadronic W transverse momentum cuts are loosened (see Table 11). As well, additional background has been produced for \(30<P_{t}^{h}<50\) GeV/_c_ and for \(10<P_{t}^{h}<30\) GeV/_c_. Table 12 gives the cross sections for each process. The Wjj background still dominates.

When loosening the cuts on transverse momentum, the number of signal events increases while the S/B and S/\(\sqrt{\rm B}\) ratios remain more or less the same (see Table 13). Table 14 gives the background composition after VBF jet cuts for both sets of looser cuts (choice I and choice II). Figures 23 show the evolution of the background shape with the value of the cut on the transverse momentum of the lepton. The signal peak is clearly distinguishable from the background for \(P_{t}^{\ell}>15\) GeV/_c_ (top plot). Unfortunately, the trigger requirements are \(P_{t}^{e}>25\) GeV/_c_ and \(P_{t}^{\mu}>20\) GeV/_c_. In order to trigger on the event, the

### Combination of jet veto and \(\mathbf{m_{Wj}}\)

In Section 5.2, it is shown that the jet veto cut is more efficient in rejecting \(\mathrm{t\bar{t}}\) background than the \(m_{\mathrm{Wj}}\) cut. However, the latter is more efficient in rejecting the Wjj background. Table 15 shows that the correlation between the two cuts is small. We combine them in the framework of approach 2 and couple them to the second set of loosened cuts (choice II: \(P_{t}^{\ell}>25\) GeV/_c_ and \(P_{t}^{\mathrm{W}}>30\) GeV/_c_).

The background composition given in Table 16 is not modified once the cuts are combined. In addition, the ratios S/B and S/\(\sqrt{\mathrm{B}}\) are significantly improved (see Tables 17 and 18), and the signal peak is even more distinguishable from the background as can be seen in Figure 24. A mass window can thus be constructed and is defined as follows:

* An analytical function, defined as a fourth order polynomial times a second order polynomial times an exponential, is fitted to the background from M\({}_{\ell\nu\mathrm{jj}}\)=160 to 800 GeV/_c\({}^{2}\)_, and subtracted from the signal+background distribution. The \(\chi^{2}\) of the fit gives \(\sim\)60/d.o.f\(\sim\)1.
* A gaussian is fitted to this signal distribution giving a mean value \(\mu\) and width \(\sigma\).
* The mass window is defined as \([\mu-2\sigma;\mu+2\sigma]\).

The fit gives \(\mu=292.0\) GeV/_c\({}^{2}\)_ and \(\sigma=18.1\) GeV/_c\({}^{2}\)_. The number of signal events and the ratios S/B and S/\(\sqrt{\mathrm{B}}\) inside the mass window are given in the last line of Table 18.

**Combination** & 44 \% & 10 \% & 1.2 \% \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}

## 6 Systematics

### W+jets background

One of the largest uncertainties comes from the estimation of the W+4jets background. In this note, the W+4jets component has been estimated using PYTHIA, but it is known that other generators will give very different results. We have looked at W+4jets events generated with a LO (Leading Order) ME (Matrix Element) MC (MADGRAPH) interfaced with Herwig [12] to evaluate these differences.

We have looked at 50k W+4jets events generated with a hard cut on the transverse momentum of the partons of \(P_{t}^{h}>20\) GeV/\(c\), for which the cross-section times branching ratio is \(\sigma\times\)B.R.(W+jets \(\rightarrow\ell\nu\)jj) = 581 pb, interfaced with Herwig [12].

wig 6.503. The efficiency after all cuts but before the Higgs mass determination is: \(2.6\cdot 10^{-4}\).

As a comparison, for our standard analysis, Pythia Wjj events were used. The cross sections for the processes are: \(\sigma\times B.R.=2.07\cdot 10^{3}\)pb for \(P_{t}^{h}>50\) GeV/_c_, \(\sigma\times B.R.=3.08\cdot 10^{3}\)pb for \(30<P_{t}^{h}<50\) GeV/_c_, \(\sigma\times B.R.=1.33\cdot 10^{4}\)pb for \(10<P_{t}^{h}<30\) GeV/_c_, Only for the \(P_{t}^{h}>50\) GeV/_c_ sample, 100M events we produced, which after all cuts but before the Higgs mass determination, the efficiency for Wjj is \(1.6\cdot 10^{-5}\).

A factor of 16 is hence observed between the two efficiencies (Herwig versus Pythia). Considering there is a factor of 4 in the cross sections, we approximate the difference between Herwig and Pythia to about a factor 4, after all cuts but before the Higgs mass determination. This would bring our final S/B ratio down from 0.6 to 0.15, and our S/\(\sqrt{\rm B}\) ratio down from 12.9 to 6. This makes the channel even more difficult but still significant.

### Fit error

An analytical function has been fitted to the background, and has been subtracted from the signal+background distribution. The \(\chi^{2}\) of the fit gives 1/d.o.f. The

Figure 24: Higgs candidate invariant mass distribution for 30 fb\({}^{-1}\), with a 800 GeV/_c\({}^{2}\)_ cut on the VBF jets invariant mass. The full line is the background, while the points with error bars are the signal+background. The transverse momentum cuts applied are: \(P_{t}^{\ell}>25\) GeV/_c_ and \(P_{t}^{\rm W}>30\) GeV/_c_. The jet veto and Wj invariant mass cuts have been combined.

systematic uncertainty originating from this fit will be negligible next to the one described previously for the W+jets background uncertainty.

## 7 Conclusion

In this study, it has been shown that the method for selecting the VBF jets and the loosening of the W \(P_{t}\) cut can make the shape of the signal and background distributions evolve, in order to distinguish one from the other.

While the TDR analysis divides the detector into two distinct regions (central \(|\eta|<2\) and forward \(|\eta|>2\)), two global approaches are envisaged here.

In the first approach, the VBF candidate jets are the ones with the largest energies and with a large \(\eta_{\rm j1j2}\) separation. The energy of the jets being highly correlated with their pseudo-rapidity, this approach turns out to be very similar to the standard TDR analysis.

In the second approach, the hadronic W is reconstructed first, and only then are the VBF jets searched for. A cut on the invariant mass of the jets is applied. The signal and background distributions start to be interestingly distinguishable. Some transverse momentum cuts are released and additional backgrounds are considered. The following result is obtained:

\[{\rm S/\sqrt{B}=9.2}\]

\[{\rm S/B=0.17}.\]

From then on, the signal peak in the invariant mass distribution is distinguishable from the background.

These results are further improved by adding a cut on the Wj invariant mass (S/B and S/\(\sqrt{B}\) improved by a factor of close to 60% and 10% respectively). The signal peak is even more distinguishable from the background, and a mass window can be constructed. The result, using this mass window, is given by:

\[{\rm S/\sqrt{B}=12.9}\]

\[{\rm S/B=0.58}.\]

It has been shown that a Standard Model 300 GeV/\(c^{2}\) Higgs can be observed and its mass peak reconstructed in the \({\rm qqH\to qqWW\to qq\ell\nu jj}\) channel for 30 fb\({}^{-1}\). This channel is nicely complementary to the golden H \(\to\) ZZ \(\to 4\ell\), for which the signal significance is S/\(\sqrt{B}\simeq 22.2\)[13].
