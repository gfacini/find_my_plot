**Abstract**

The H8 test beam setup has been equipped with a tracking system, able to reconstruct the track position in the MDT chambers under test with an accuracy of \(\leq 50\)\(\mu\)m over a large area. The system consists of two detectors, based on drift tubes. Each detector is made by two multilayers, one for the horizontal and one for the vertical coordinate. The tubes, filled with an Argon-Isobutane gas mixture, are operated in streamer mode. This note describes the setup, calibration and performances of this system. With adequate statistics, the system is capable of checking over a wide area the MDT performances, especially the calibration and the accuracy in the mechanical construction.

Introduction

The Atlas muon spectrometer consists in a system of drift chambers, with accurate mechanical and calibration properties. It is therefore important to test these performances for test specimens, in realistic conditions.

For this purpose, the test beam setup requires a precise external tracking detector, in two dimensions over a wide area (as shown in this note, the measurement of the second coordinate is necessary for the alignment and the treatment of inclined tracks). This task has been realized with two high precision tracker detectors, positioned along the beam line with a long lever arm. Each detector consists of two multilayers, at 90\({}^{\circ}\) each other, both perpendicular to the beam direction. The multilayers are made of drift tubes, mechanically similar to the MDT, chosen for their properties of accuracy and reliability. Lacking the strict requirements of the Atlas experiment, the system has been realized with cheaper and simpler operating conditions of the drift tubes. A mixture of Argon and Isobutane, operated in streamer mode, offers good efficiency and resolution and, at the same time, provides stable and reliable operations.

Instead, the mechanical tolerances and external alignment are potential sources of systematics uncertainty and therefore very demanding. The same construction methods as for MDT chambers have been used, in order to obtain the required accuracy of \(\leq\) 10 \(\mu\)m. The external alignment between the two trackers and among the different muon detectors has been measured by an external survey, followed by a fit with high momentum particles.

This note describes the operations and performances of the tracking system. In section 2 the trackers setup and the operating conditions in the 1998 data-taking period are reviewed. In section 3, the calibration method, very similar to the one used for MDT chambers, is discussed, together with the alignment. In section 4 the tracker performances are studied. In section 5 the error on the interpolation at the level of a MDT chamber prototype position is discussed. Both the tracker accuracy and the multiple scattering contributes to the overall uncertainty, which in another note [1] is compared with the results obtained with the Calypso MDT prototype. Finally, section 6 contains the conclusions.

## 2 Detector characteristics and experimental setup

Each tracker consists of two multilayers of drift tubes at 90\({}^{\circ}\). The multilayers, which are mechanically similar to those used in the MDT chambers (see e.g. [2],[3],[4]), consist of three layers of 16 tubes each. As in the MDT chambers, the layers are staggered by half of a tube, to resolve reconstruction ambiguities and to obtain a better mechanical stability. The length of the tubes is \(\sim\) 80 cm.

During the 1998 data taking period the trackers were filled with a Argon (40%) -Isobutane (60%) gas mixture, which was chosen for its characteristics of easy setup and good resolution. The chambers were operated in streamer mode, at 5200-5250 V, tuned to get the best space resolution. The discriminator threshold was set well below the signal corresponding to a single ionization cluster. In this conditions, the gain was \(\sim\) 10\({}^{8}\).

Fig. 1 shows the experimental setup for the 1998 data-taking period. The coordinate system is such that the x-coordinate is approximately parallel to the beam line, the y-coordinate horizontal and the z-coordinate vertical. The four multilayers have been positioned in such a way that in each tracker one multilayer measures the y-coordinate (in the following referred to as a _y-tracker 1_ and _y-tracker 2_), and the other the z-coordinate e (_z-tracker 1_ and _z-tracker 2_).

We used alternatively two trigger hodoscopes. The small area one is given by the coincidence

from the initial approximation and valid for all the tubes. Fig. 4 shows this relation, which, as is also evident from fig. 2, exhibits a strong non-linearity. Therefore, apart from its intrinsic importance, the autocalibration of the trackers is also a useful test of the autocalibration technique for a non-linear gas mixture (see ref. [1] for a more extensive discussion of this subject). Fig. 5 shows the scatter plot of the residuals to the line fit, as a function of the signed drift path, for the central tube of the central layer of the first multilayer in the small area data. The plot shows the absence of systematic effects as a function of the drift distance. As discussed in the following, this distribution is also used to compute the single tube resolution.

The r-t relation, computed from the small-area data, has been compared with the equivalent function, obtained using the same algorithm from the large-area data. Fig. 6 shows the difference between the two relations, as a function of the drift path. The r.m.s. of the distribution is 22 \(\mu\)m.

Another independent test of the calibration is offered by the data taken in the summer 1997, with the same working condition of the trackers and a similar detector setup. Fig. 7 shows the difference between the r-t relation computed from the autocalibration and the one measured from the extrapolation of the measurements in the silicon detector Odysseus [9], as a function of the drift path. Given the accuracy of the silicon detector (see e.g. [3]), this difference can be interpreted as the systematic error in the autocalibration. The distribution shows that the error is compatible with the expectations of \(\leq\) 20 \(\mu\)m.

The relative alignment of the two trackers is performed in few steps. In the y-z plane, no computation is necessary, because the two y-multilayers have been mechanically aligned respect to the vertical, in such a way that the wires are parallel to \(\leq\) 100 \(\mu\)rad. We also use a precise survey (\(\pm\)0.5 \(mm\)) of the position of all the detectors along the x-coordinate, in order to avoid a deterioration of the resolution due to the non-negligible angular spread of the beam.

In the x-y plane, for a given position of the detectors, we fit for each event two straight lines through the two y-trackers. The second tracker is then rotated in such a way that the average angular difference between the first and second line be zero. We then extrapolate the two lines at the intermediate value of x, and compute their space difference along y. The second tracker is then translated, in order to have the average value of this difference equal to zero. Figures 8 and 9 show the distribution of the differences for the angular and spatial constants after the alignment. Their r.m.s. are 4 mrad and 2.4 cm respectively, well compatible with the propagation of the measurement errors.

After these corrections, the two trackers are properly aligned, in a way to define a unique coordinate system in three dimensions.

Figure 8: Difference in the angle in the x-y plane for the same track fitted in the first and second y-tracker.

Figure 7: Difference between the r-t relation computed with the autocalibration technique and that measured from the silicon telescope, as a function of the drift path.

Then, we compute the constants between the trackers and Calypso systems. After the autocorrelation of Calypso [1], we can compare for each event the lines through the trackers and Calypso in the x-y plane. The rotation and translation constants of Calypso are then computed in the same way as in the previous case.

The last step is the angle between Calypso and the trackers in the y-z plane. For each event, the line computed with the y-trackers is compared with the one from the measurement in Calypso, at the x-coordinate of the center of Calypso, as a function of the z-coordinate, computed with the z-trackers. Fig. 10 shows the average difference in the y-coordinate between the two lines, as a function of the z-coordinate. From the fit shown in the figure, we derive the value of the rotation in the y-z plane between the trackers and Calypso systems.

## 4 Single point resolution

Figure 11 shows the tracker resolution, as a function of the drift path. The figure has been computed by comparing a given hit with the extrapolation at the same x-coordinate of the line fitted with all the other measurements. The error due to the fit has been deconvoluted from the r.m.s. of the residuals, using the same method described in [3], [4]. The shape of the resolution is in good agreement with other measurements, which use gas mixtures with similar drift properties, and electronics and operating conditions of the chamber comparable with ours.

We notice that, in agreement with the expectations, for large drift paths the resolution is dominated by the diffusion, while close to the wire the most important contributions come from the discrete cluster production mechanism and from the increase of the drift velocity.

## 5 Errors on the interpolated track

The tracker system has been primarily built to test the MDT chambers. Therefore, its main characteristic is the error in the interpolation of the six-point straight line, at the position of the MDT chamber under test. This section deals with the statistical error of this measurement.

The error due to the tracker accuracy is computed by propagating the resolution discussed in sect. 4, for a sample of tracks. The average value is 41 \(\mu\)m, and in no case exceeds 45 \(\mu\)m.

A different source of discrepancy in the comparison between the tracker line and the MDT points is given by the multiple scattering in the material interposed between the two trackers. In 1998 (apart for few special runs, not discussed here) it consisted in the two chambers (Calypso and BOS). A simple computation, which includes all the relevant materials and their geometrical setup, has been performed. Figure 12 shows the expected r.m.s. difference between the intercept of the line, computed from the track positions in the y-trackers, and the real track position in Calypso, as a function of the muon momentum. For the average momentum of the beam (180 GeV/c muons), this amounts to \(\sim 30\)\(\mu\)m. This is an independent source of uncertainty and must therefore be added in quadrature to the error due to the tracker resolution. Figure 13 shows the final overall accuracy at the MDT level, computed for a sample of tracks measured in the trackers. The abscissa is the distance between the track and the nearest wire in the central layer of Calypso 1.

Therefore, even with few hundreds of particles, the design performance of (better than) 10 \(\mu\)m can be easily achieved at the statistical level. However, we remind that the absence of systematics, at the level of the requested accuracy in the MDT chambers (i.e. \(\leq 10\)\(\mu\)m), is more relevant than the statistical precision, which can be reduced by increasing the track sample. In

ref. [1] the r-t relation measured in Calypso from the external tracking system is compared with the function computed with the autocorrelation method. Also the distribution of the difference between the measured MDT coordinate and the interpolation from the trackers is studied. Both these tests show the accuracy and reliability of the tracker and Calypso detectors.

## 6 Conclusions

The tracker system of the H8 test beam has been studied with the help of a sample of 180 GeV/c muon tracks.

The calibration and alignment of the system has been performed, both between the two trackers and with the MDT prototype Calypso. The error on the intercept of the straight trajectory computed with the trackers in the MDT chambers is in the range of 50 \(\mu\)m. Therefore, even with moderate statistics, the check of the MDT systematics at the 10 \(\mu\)m level over a wide area is clearly possible.
