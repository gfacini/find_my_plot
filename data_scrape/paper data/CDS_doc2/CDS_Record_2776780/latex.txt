# Digluon Tagging using \(\sqrt{s}=13\) TeV \(pp\) Collisions in the ATLAS Detector

The ATLAS Collaboration

Jet substructure has played a key role in the development of two-prong taggers designed to identify Lorentz-boosted massive particles. Traditionally, these taggers have focused on Lorentz-boosted \(W\), \(Z\), and Higgs bosons decaying into pairs of quarks. However, there are a variety of models that predict new bosons with two-prong decays at other masses. In particular, light scalar or pseudoscalar particles (\(a\) bosons) from extended Higgs sectors or axion-like particle models could result in Lorentz-boosted digluon jets (\(a\to gg\)). If the mass of the \(a\) particle is much less than the mass of the Standard Model Higgs boson, then the two gluons will be collimated inside a single jet. This note studies the properties of digluon jets and investigates advanced techniques based on deep learning to separate them from generic quark and gluon jets.

## 1 Introduction

Many Standard Model (SM) and Beyond the SM (BSM) processes produce Lorentz boosted, hadronically decaying, massive particles. The decay products of these particles are collimated and can be captured by a single jet. A variety of jet substructure techniques have been proposed to use the radiation pattern within these jets to identify the multiple prongs from the collimated decay products and separate them from generic quark and gluon jets [1; 2; 3; 4; 5; 6]. These tools have been widely applied to tag boosted \(W/Z\) and Higgs bosons as well as top quarks. Boosted BSM bosons \(X\) have also been studied all the way down to the Upsilon mass \(m_{X}\gtrsim m_{\Upsilon}\)[7; 8; 9; 10; 11; 12; 13; 14; 15].

All of the two-prong taggers so far have been developed for jets initiated by multiple nearby quarks from massive particles with at least tens of \(\mathrm{Ge\kern-1.0ptV}\) of mass. However, there are strong theoretical motivations for studying other types of jets. In particular, a variety of BSM models predict the existence of massive (pseudo-)scalar particles decaying into gluons, \(a\to gg\). Just as the SM Higgs boson can decay into gluons via quantum loop-induced processes, the decay of \(a\to gg\) can be dominant in certain two-Higgs doublet models [16; 17; 18; 19]. If the \(a\) is very light (\(m_{a}<2m_{\Upsilon}\)), this can be caused by kinematic suppression of other decay modes. Even if the \(a\) is not light, if the ratio of the vacuum expectation values of the two Higgs doublets (\(\tan\beta\)) is much less than one, the coupling to down type quarks and charged leptons can be suppressed. Another possibility is that there is a new heavy vector-like fermion that couples to the \(a\) and allows for \(a\to\gamma\gamma\) or \(a\to gg\) as quantum loop-induced processes. In fact, many models that motivate new particles coupling strongly to \(\gamma\gamma\) (e.g. 750 \(\mathrm{Ge\kern-1.0ptV}\) diphotons [20]) have a region of parameter space that also favors a large branching ratio to gluons. There are also models that do not have a diphoton component. For example, models with warped extra dimensions could have only Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) extended in the bulk and the corresponding radion would decay predominantly to gluons [21].

The phenomenology of the \(a\to gg\) channel varies strongly with \(m_{a}\). In this note, the decay of the scalar \(a\) is assumed to be prompt and be produced by the SM Higgs boson. For \(m_{a}\gtrsim m_{h}/2\), the final state from \(H\to aa\) involves four resolved and low momentum jets. Given the large rate of low momentum jet production at the LHC, this region of the parameter space is likely intractable. When \(m_{a}\lesssim 1\)\(\mathrm{Ge\kern-1.0ptV}\), the \(a\) decays into exclusive final states involving a small number of hadrons. This note examines the intermediate regime. In this part of parameter space, the \(a\) is sufficiently light that it has a significant Lorentz boost in the laboratory frame and thus its decay products are collimated into a single jet with radius \(\lesssim 0.4\). The tagging of digluon jets is essential for reducing the background from generic quark and gluon jets. A \(a\to\) hadrons tagger based on jet substructure observables was first studied in the context of a \(H\to Za\) search in Ref. [22]. This note explores how to exploit all of the available information, using every track inside candidate digluon jets to train a deep neural network based on the particle flow network [23; 24], which can process variable-length sets of objects. The performance of this approach is studied in simulation and compared to other classical approaches based on jet shapes.

This note is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces the datasets and Sec. 3 describes the reconstructed objects used for this study. A variety of jet substructure observables are explored in Sec. 4. The \(a\to gg\) jet tagger is then constructed using all tracks inside jets and tested in Sec. 5. This task is accomplished by first reweighting the simulation to the data in a mass sideband and interpolating into the region near the Higgs boson mass. Then, a classifier is trained with these weights, taking as input all of the tracks inside both the leading and subleading jets in the event. This information is combined with global event information to form a single tagger. The performance of the per-jet components is then quantified. The note ends with conclusions and outlook in Sec. 6.

## 2 Data and Monte Carlo samples

The tagger described in Sec. 5.3 was developed using Monte Carlo (MC) simulated samples for the signal \(H\to aa\to gggg\) process that is produced in association with a \(Z\) boson decaying to muons, and MC simulated samples for the background process \(Z\to\mu\mu\) + QCD jets. These processes are modeled using Powheg-Box v2 [25; 26; 27] integrated with Pythia 8.2 [28; 29] using the AZNLO [30] set of tuned parameters and the NNPDF3.0nlo Parton Distribution Function (PDF) set [31] for the signal and the CT10NLO PDF set [32] for the background. The matrix elements for the signal use GoSAm[33] and the MiNLO procedure [34; 35] for merging with the parton shower. Six signal masses for the BSM scalar were evenly sampled in the range [0.5, 16] GeV on a logarithmic scale. All MC samples were processed through the full ATLAS detector simulation [36] pipeline based on Geant4[37]. The pileup conditions simulated in these events are designed to closely match the environment seen in data recorded by ATLAS over the course of its 2015-2018 data taking period. In particular, minimum-bias events are overlaid on the hard-scatter process. The minimum-bias are generated with Pythia 8.186 using the A3 set of tuned parameters [38] and the NNPDF2.3lo PDF set.

About 5 fb\({}^{-1}\) data collected by ATLAS in 2018 was used to reweight the background to better match the corresponding distributions in data, as discussed in Sec. 5.3. These data were collected using single muon triggers following a standard dimuon selection - see e.g. Ref. [39] for details including the background composition (everything other than \(Z\)+jets is negligible). For the event selection in this analysis, the two muons with \(|\eta|<2.4\) and loose, variable-cone isolation [40] are required to have \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>25\) GeV, opposite electric charge, and \(m_{\mu\mu}\) within 10 GeV of the \(Z\) boson mass.

## 3 Reconstructed objects

The object reconstruction and jet labelling are described below:

**PFlow Jets:** Particle flow (PFlow) jets are constructed with the anti-\(k_{t}\) algorithm [41] as implemented in FastJet [42] using the radius parameter \(R=0.4\), using charged constituents associated with the primary vertex and neutral constituents as inputs [43]. The jet energy is then corrected for overlapping proton-proton collisions (pileup) and calibrated [44] using MC simulations and data. The jets used in this analysis are required to have transverse momentum \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) > 20 GeV and \(|\eta|\) < 2.5 1. The Jet Vertex Tagger (JVT) discriminant [45] is used to reject jets that do not originate from the hard-scatter vertex through the use of tracking and vertexing information for jets with \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) < 60 GeV and \(|\eta|\) < 2.4.

Footnote 1: ATLAS uses a right-handed coordinate system with its origin at the nominal interaction point (IP) in the centre of the detector and the z-axis along the beam pipe. The x-axis points from the IP to the centre of the LHC ring, and the y-axis points upward. Cylindrical coordinates (\(t\), \(\phi\)) are used in the transverse plane, \(\phi\) being the azimuthal angle around the beam pipe. The pseudorapidity is defined in terms of the polar angle \(\theta\) as \(\eta=-\log\tan{(\theta/2)}\). Angular distance is measured in units of \(\Delta R=\sqrt{(\Delta\eta)^{2}+(\Delta\phi)^{2}}\).

**Truth jets:** Truth jets in simulated events are made using truth information from the event record of the MC generator. Stable particles with proper lifetimes \(c\tau_{0}>10\) mm are clustered into these jets using the same clustering algorithms and \(R=0.4\) as for detector-level jets. Particles such as muons and neutrinos which do not leave significant energy deposits in the calorimeter are excluded.

**QCD Jet Quark-Gluon / Signal Diglun labeling:** The labeling of the background QCD jets as originating from either a quark or gluon in simulation is done by geometrically matching the PFlow jets with truth jets.

If the truth jet geometrically closest to the PFlow jet has \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>10\) GeV and is found within \(\Delta R=0.3\) of the PFlow jet's direction, the PFlow jet is assigned the label of the truth jet. Truth jets are labeled using the highest energy parton within the jet cone from the MC event record. While quark/gluon labeling is not unique [46; 47], the simple procedure used here is useful for building an intuition for the performance of the digluon tagger. In the signal samples, jets are labeled as digluon jets if they match within \(\Delta R=0.4\) with an \(a\) boson from the MC event record.

**Tracks:** Tracks are reconstructed from energy deposits, or hits, in the inner detector system [48] and are required to pass a quality selection: each track must have at least 7 hits in the silicon layers (pixel and silicon microstrip tracker, including dead pixels), less than three missing hits in the silicon layers, less than two missing hits in the pixel detector, less than two hits shared by multiple tracks, at least one hit in the pixel detector, \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\)? 500 MeV and \(|\eta|\)! 2.5 [49]. Tracks are associated with the primary vertex, defined as the reconstructed vertex with largest \(\sum p_{\mathrm{T}}^{2}\) of the associated tracks [50]. Tracks are associated to jets if \(\Delta R<0.6\). This is larger than the jet clustering radius parameter to improve performance for higher mass \(a\) bosons.

## 4 Differences between signal and generic quark/gluon jets

Figure 1 presents the invariant mass of the leading two jets using the simulations introduced in Sec. 2. All of the signal samples have an \(m_{\mathrm{jj}}\) peak near the Higgs boson mass (125 GeV) while the background is smooth and steeply falling beyond about 50 GeV. In the limit of small \(m_{a}\), a single jet is sufficient to capture the \(a\) decay products and the peak is well localized near 125 GeV. However, for larger \(a\) masses, the \(R=0.4\) jets are not able to capture all of the decay products and so the peak broadens and shifts to lower values. Properties of the radiation pattern within the \(a\to gg\) jets are explored in further detail below.

One of the most basic features of a jet is the number of constituents. Since the \(a\) boson is a color singlet, it is expected that the number of decay products is independent of its \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) and is instead only dependent on \(m_{a}\). In contrast, the number of constituents inside a generic quark or gluon jet increases with the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\), with gluons having more constituents than the quarks due to the larger quantum charge under the strong force. Charged particles can be accurately measured inside jets and are used in this study as a proxy for all the constituents of the \(a\to gg\) jets. Figure 2 shows histograms of the number of tracks inside jets in three jet \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) bins. As expected, the spectra are nearly independent of \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) for the signal and shift to the right for the

Figure 1: Invariant mass of the two leading jets in the event, \(m_{\mathrm{jj}}\), using reconstructed jets (left) and truth jets (right).

background. A jet from \(m_{a}=16\) GeV has about twice as many tracks as a jet with \(m_{a}\lesssim 2\) GeV. When the \(a\) is sufficiently light, the number of hadron decay products does not depend strongly on \(m_{a}\) because the available phase space only allows for a small number of particles (mostly pions).

In addition to having a different number of constituents, \(a\to gg\) jets differ from generic quark and gluon jets in the angular distribution of the constituents. Figure 3 shows histograms of the \(\Delta R\) between the leading two tracks within jets. Both signal and background jets become more collimated as the jet \(p_{\rm T}\) increases, although the spread for the signal is typically smaller than for the background.

Figure 2: Number of tracks in the event associated to a given jet (\(\Delta R<0.6\)), for signal \(a\to gg\) jets (left), background QCD quark / gluon jets (right). Different \(p_{\rm T}\) bins are shown from top to bottom.

In addition to these features displayed above, it is also interesting to examine classical jet substructure observables to explore differences between the digluon and quark/gluon jets. Figure 4 shows the two point energy correlation function [51] for these jets. This metric is calculated using all the tracks associated to the jets, using the following formula,

\[\text{ECF}(2,1)\equiv C_{1}=\frac{\sum_{i,j}^{\text{tracks}}p_{\text{T}_{i}}.p _{\text{T}_{j}}.\Delta R_{ij}}{(\sum_{k}^{\text{tracks}}p_{\text{T}_{k}})^{2} }\,, \tag{1}\]

where \(\Delta R_{ij}\) is the angular distance between tracks \(i\) and \(j\).

Another well-studied observable shown in Fig. 5 is \(p_{\rm T}D\)[52], which probes the energy fractions carried by a jet's constituents independent of their geometric orientation:

\[p_{\rm T}D=\frac{\sqrt{\sum_{i}^{\rm tracks}p_{\rm T_{i}}^{2}}}{\sum_{j}^{\rm tracks }p_{\rm T_{j}}}\,. \tag{2}\]

Figure 4: ECF(2,1) evaluated using tracks in the event associated to a given jet (\(\Delta R<0.6\)), for signal \(a\to gg\) jets (left), background QCD quark / gluon jets (right). Different \(p_{\rm T}\) bins are shown from top to bottom.

Figure 4 shows that signal jets tend to have a lower ECF(2,1) and Fig. 5 shows a roughly equal sharing of momentum by the leading constituents (the peak for the low-mass signals corresponds to \(\sqrt{0.5^{2}+0.5^{2}}\sim 0.7\)).

The next section explores how the observations above can be used to design a tagger to distinguish \(a\to gg\) jets from quark/gluon jets using all of the tracks within a jet.

Figure 5: The jet substructure observable \(p_{\mathrm{T}}D\) evaluated using tracks in the event associated to a given jet (\(\Delta R<0.6\)), for signal \(a\to gg\) jets (left), background QCD quark / gluon jets (right). \(p_{\mathrm{T}}D\) varies slowly with \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) so only the nominal \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) bin is shown.

## 5 \(a\to gg\) Tagger

### Architecture

The full architecture of the event level signal \(H\to aa\to gggg\) and background \(Z\) + QCD jets tagger is shown in Figure 6. It is comprised of two main components: a jet level tagger that takes in the variable length track inputs from each of the two leading jets and an event level tagger that uses global information. These two components are combined to return a single score per event.

The jet level tagger architecture is shown inside the dashed box in Figure 6. The tracks inside jets are represented as a variable-length set and are processed using a deep sets neural network [24], implemented as a particle flow network [23]. Each track is summarized by its \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) and \(\Delta R\) to the jet axis. The network operates by first embedding each track into a latent space and then summing all latent space vectors together. A fully connected network then acts on the summed vector. A similar setup is used for the Deep Sets based Neural Networks for Impact Parameter Flavour Tagging algorithm used by ATLAS to tag \(b\)-quark jets [53]. The event level tagger combines the information from the 2D latent space of both the leading jets from the event, as well as the information from the jet 4-vectors and the Z boson 4-vector obtained by adding the lepton 4-vectors from the event. This is done in a fully connected network that culminates in a single probability score for each event to be signal. Separate taggers are trained for each of the mass points that are tested. Note that the jet level tagger is generic whereas the event level tagger is specific to the signal channel targeted and thus needs to be adapted to other final states of interest.

All networks are trained using Keras[54] and TensorFlow[55] using the Adam[56] optimization algorithm. A rectified linear unit (ReLU) activation function is used for all intermediate layers and a sigmoid is used for the final layer. The three fully connected layers in the jet level tagger and the event level tagger are comprised of 100 nodes each, and the latent space embedding layers in the jet level tagger are comprised of 100 nodes as well. None of these parameters were heavily optimized.

Figure 6: Architecture of the full event level signal - background tagger. The network consists of two components, a jet level tagger and an event level tagger. The jet level tagger that embeds each of the two leading jets from an event into a 2-D latent space is highlighted within the dashed box; It uses the same set of weights to embed both jets into two distinct 2-D latent spaces. The layers labelled TimeDistributed correspond to layers that embed each track into a high dimensional space using the same weights to process each track. The Addition_Over_Tracks layer adds up the latent vectors across all the tracks, which results in dimensional reduction and also is a permutation invariant operation across the tracks.

### Tagger training

During training, special attention is paid to ensure that the output score of the tagger is decorrelated with the invariant mass of the two leading jets in the event (\(m_{\mathrm{jj}}\)) for the background \(Z\) + QCD jets events. This is done to ensure that the data driven ABCD background estimation strategy can be used to estimate the \(Z\) + QCD jets events in the signal region when trying to find the signal \(H\to aa\to gggg\) events in data. ABCD background estimation requires the two axes of the plane in which the four regions (A, B, C, and D) are defined to be independent for the background events, and in the case of this analysis the output of tagger along with \(m_{\mathrm{jj}}\) form the two axes of the ABCD plane [57]. Then, one can estimate the background in the most signal-like region from the other three regions.

The independence of the tagger output and \(m_{\mathrm{jj}}\) for the background class is enforced on the tagger by adding a penalty to the loss function that is proportional to the generalized correlation between the two distributions. The distance correlation metric [58; 59; 60; 61] is used as the generalized correlation due to its ability to capture nonlinear dependence between distributions, and its differentiable form is expressed as a DisCo loss function [62] as follows,

\[\mathrm{dCov}^{2}(X,Y) =\langle|X-X^{\prime}||Y-Y^{\prime}|\rangle+\langle|X-X^{\prime} |\rangle\langle|Y-Y^{\prime}|\rangle-2\langle|X-X^{\prime}||Y-Y^{\prime\prime}|\rangle \tag{3}\] \[\mathrm{dCorr}^{2}(X,Y) =\frac{\mathrm{dCov}^{2}(X,Y)}{\mathrm{dCov}(X,X)\mathrm{dCov}(Y,Y)}\] (4) \[L =L_{\mathrm{classifier}}(\vec{y},\vec{y}_{\mathrm{true}})+ \lambda\,\mathrm{dCorr}^{2}_{y_{\mathrm{true}}=0}(\vec{m}_{jj},\vec{y}) \tag{5}\]

Here \(|.|\) is the vector norm, \((X,Y)\), \((X^{\prime},Y^{\prime})\), \((X^{\prime\prime},Y^{\prime\prime})\) are independent and identically distributed samples from the joint distribution (X,Y). \(L\) is the training loss used in the tagger, where \(L_{\mathrm{classifier}}\) is the binary cross entropy loss and the \(\lambda\) is a hyperparameter that is coarsely scanned for the best setting. Note here that \(y_{\mathrm{true}}=0\) selects the background events from the set of events that are being iterated over, ensuring that the \(m_{\mathrm{jj}}\) - tagger output dependence is penalized only for the background class during training.

Additionally, care is also taken to ensure that the background \(Z\) + QCD jets simulation events used to train the tagger do not deviate significantly from the data in regions that are expected to be devoid of signal. While this is not required to ensure reasonable background estimation since the ABCD method is data driven, it helps guarantee that the trained taggers are as close to optimal and have not learned any features that would be otherwise absent in data. This is done by reweighting the background events using a classifier that is trained to distinguish between data and background before training the signal versus background classifier. The architecture of the reweighting classifier is identical to the main event tagger shown in Figure 6, where no distance correlation penalty is added to the loss function and instead \(m_{\mathrm{jj}}\) is passed to the tagger as an event level input in order for it to learn the dependence on \(m_{\mathrm{jj}}\)[63; 64] for interpolation into the signal region. The data and background events are required to have \(m_{\mathrm{jj}}\leq 85\) GeV or \(m_{\mathrm{jj}}\geq 165\) GeV to ensure that the events come from the signal devoid regions of the phase space.

The reweighting function is learned using a well-known [65; 66] (also in high-energy physics [63; 67; 68; 69; 70; 71; 72; 73; 74; 75; 76; 77; 78]) fact that a classifier trained with the binary cross entropy loss function learns to approximate a function monotonic with the ratio of class likelihoods. In particular, if the neural network \(f(x)\) is trained to distinguish data from simulation, then \(f(x)/(1-f(x))\) will be proportional to \(p(x|\mathrm{data})/p(x|\mathrm{simulation})\). The features \(x\) are all of the tracks inside the jets. While machine learning-based reweighting has been used before in data analyses [79; 80], this is the first high- and variable-dimensional reweighting [81] applied to collider data.

The performance of the reweighting is verified in Fig. 7. The left plot of Fig. 7 shows that the \(m_{\rm jj}\) distribution is well-modeled after the reweighting, even in the region around the Higgs boson mass, which was excluded from the learning. Furthermore, since all tracks are used in the reweighting, it is expected that all high-level observables built from these tracks should also be well-modeled. This is illustrated in the right plot of Fig. 7 for the ECF(2,1) observable introduced earlier.

This reweighting is used for both training the signal versus background classifier and for evaluating its performance in the next section.

### Tagger Performance

Following the findings from Sec. 4, the tagger used to classify the signal \(H\to aa\to gggg\) events and the background \(Z\) + QCD jets events was designed and trained as described in Sec. 5. To gauge how effectively the tagger learns the differences between the signal digluon jets and the background QCD quark and gluon jets, the per-jet tagger is extracted from Sec. 5. A simple fully connected network is trained on node of the network just before being combined with the event information. This is required to transform the output into a classifier score. The resulting score is then used to make a Receiver Operator Characteristic (ROC) curve as shown in Fig. 8. Interestingly, the performance for discriminating against quark jets (left plot of Fig. 8) is lower than that for gluon jets (right plot of Fig. 8), and both degrade for the higher scalar masses. This is further highlighted in Fig. 9 where the ratio of gluon rejection to quark rejection is shown. This is consistent with the trends seen in Sec. 4 where the separation is greatest between the gluon and the digluon distributions for the lower scalar masses. The discriminating power degrades with higher masses, consistent with earlier sections that showed that the digluon jets using \(R=0.4\) start to resemble the background. For a digluon efficiency of 50%, a rejection of 100-1000 is achievable for the lower signal masses; in contrast, quark versus gluon tagging at the same efficiency can achieve a rejection of about 10 [82; 83]. Furthermore

Figure 7: Distributions for data and \(Z\) + QCD jets MC background before and after variable- and high-dimensional reweighting. Events with \(m_{\rm jj}\) inside the signal region contained within the two vertical lines in (a) were excluded during training of the reweighting classifier. Only the lowest \(p_{\rm T}\) bin is shown in (b) that displays the largest correction from the reweighting scheme.

the performance of tagger is contrasted with the separation achieved from using the ECF(2,1) observable in Fig.10, where it is apparent that at low mass, the tagger is able to learn a lot more about the differences between the QCD quark/gluon jets and the signal digluon jets than the simple substructure observables.

Figure 8: Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves of the jet classifier derived from the jet level tagger module of the full signal - background classifier from Fig. 6. The background jets are from the same \(Z\)+jets sample used to train the tagger. QCD gluon jet rejection (right) is better than QCD quark jet rejection (left), with performance degrading as the scalar mass increases due to worsening collimation and increasing number of tracks in the digluon jets. Here the ROC curves for two jet \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) bins is shown (top - bottom). The lines labeled ‘Random’ correspond to digluon efficiency = \(1/\)QCD rejection.

## 6 Conclusion

This note has demonstrated a jet substructure-based technique to tag \(a\to gg\) digluon jets that arise from the prompt decay of light BSM scalars which can couple to the SM Higgs boson. The range of the BSM scalar masses targeted boosts the decay products into a single small-radius jet, which enables the tagger to learn about the unique radiation pattern from single jets. This allows the tagger to effectively separate the digluon jets from generic QCD quark or gluon jets that have a relatively diffuse radiation pattern.

The deep neural network based tagger makes use of every track inside candidate digluon jets to train a high dimensional classifier that can process a variable number of tracks per jet. Moreover the tagger uses a novel technique to enforce the necessary decorrelation needed for background estimation. Additionally it uses simulated background events for training that have been reweighted to better match data using a variable- and high-dimensional reweighting scheme that consequently matches jet substructure distributions along

Here the QCD gluon jet rejection (right) and QCD quark jet rejection (left) are shown for the lowest \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) bin from Fig. 8 for three representative mass points. Note that these curves show that the rejection achieved using ECF(2,1) is lower than the rejection using the jet classifier, particularly for the lower signal masses.

with event level observables. The performance of jet tagger is extracted from the full signal - background classifier, and is found to demonstrate excellent generic quark / gluon jet rejection properties. Further enhancements to this tagger can be made by expanding the track features used for every jet, and passing pre-computed classical jet substructure observables to aid in the tagger learning and embedding process.
