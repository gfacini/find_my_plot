**Preliminary studies for a STXS simplified fiducial decay volume for the four lepton final state of the Higgs boson**

The ATLAS Collaboration

This note describes a preliminary simplified fiducial decay selection for the \(H\to 4\ell\) channel to be used with STXS measurements in order to reduce acceptance corrections needed in the presence of BSM contributions in the \(H\to 4\ell\) decay. The simplified fiducial decay selection is Lorentz invariant in order to have a production mode and boost independent acceptance. More than 99% of the events selected in the ATLAS Run 2 STXS measurement in the \(H\to 4\ell\) channel are contained in the simplified fiducial decay volume.

## 1 Introduction

Many current ATLAS and CMS Higgs boson measurements are done in the STXS scheme of production mode classification [1; 2; 3]. While the STXS classification foresees subdivision into different kinematic production regions, it is inclusive in Higgs boson decays. As can be seen in the ATLAS \(H\to 4\ell\) measurements [4], the inclusive treatment of the Higgs boson decay mode with the Standard Model acceptance is creating a bias to the \(H\to 4\ell\) decay in case of new physics contributions. This bias needs then to be corrected by acceptance correction for beyond Standard Model interpretations of the measurements [4].

This notes introduces a Lorentz invariant simplified fiducial decay selection for the \(H\to 4\ell\) channel (where \(\ell\) refers to either \(e\) or \(\mu\)) that approximates the experimental selections in Ref. [4] and largely removes biases to the acceptance in case of new physics contributions. The effect of new physics contributions are tested within the SMEFT framework using the EFT operator eigenvectors defined in Ref. [5] that are relevant to the \(H\to 4\ell\) decay.

## 2 Event selection

In the following comparisons the experimental \(H\to 4\ell\) selection of Ref. [4] is used. In order to select Higgs boson events, only events in the mass window \(115\) GeV \(<m_{4\ell}<130\) GeV are considered.

The simplified fiducial decay selection is similar to the experimental selection, but removes all boost dependent selection criteria, especially all lepton rapidity and transverse momentum conditions. It should be noted that all properties in the Higgs boson rest frame are intrinsically Lorentz invariant. Leptons are dressed as in Ref. [6]. The lepton dressing has a negligible impact in the context of this note, but it should be noted that it is not Lorentz invariant and will need to be updated to a Lorentz invariant version in the future. Table 1 gives a summary of the simplified fiducial decay volume. The simplified fiducial selection was optimized such that more than 99% of all reconstructed events are also selected by the simplified fiducial decay selection.

## 3 Results

In order to check for residual dependencies on the experimental acceptance after applying the simplified fiducial decay selection, the ratio of the number of events passing both the experimental and the simplified

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{l l} \hline \hline \multicolumn{2}{c}{**Event selection (at most one quadruplet per event)**} \\ \hline Momentum of leptons & Leptons momentum in the Higgs rest frame \(p>4\) GeV \\ Mass requirements & \(50\) GeV \(<m_{12}<106\) GeV and \(12\) GeV \(<m_{34}<115\) GeV \\ Lepton separation & \(Angle(\ell_{i},\ell_{j})\) in the Higgs rest frame \(>0.1(rad.)\) \\ low-mass dilepton veto & \(m(\ell_{i},\ell_{j})>5\) GeV for all SFOC lepton pairs \\ Mass window & \(115\) GeV \(<m_{4\ell}<130\) GeV \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}

fiducial decay selection compared to the number of events passing only the simplified fiducial decay selection is used and called "reconstruction fraction" in the following:

\[\text{reconstruction fraction}=\frac{\text{Reconstruction \& Fiducial}}{\text{Fiducial}}\quad.\]

This reconstruction fraction is analyzed as function of key generator level variables describing the \(H\to 4\ell\) decay properties: the invariant mass of the leading lepton pair \(m_{12}\), the invariant mass of the sub-leading lepton pair \(m_{34}\), as well as the five decay angles (\(\Phi\), \(\Phi_{1}\), \(\theta^{*}\), \(\theta_{1}\), \(\theta_{2}\)), as shown in Figure 1.

In order to compare the Standard Model (SM) reconstruction fraction with the reconstruction fraction in models beyond the SM (BSM), the SMEFT framework [7] is used. Four BSM samples are generated with the same configuration as in Ref. [5] and with Wilson coefficient values in the Warsaw basis [8] inspired by the EFT operator eigenvectors relevant to the \(H\to 4\ell\) decay defined in the same note [5]. Table 2 summarizes the Wilson coefficient values for these samples. The leading order cross section is used for the samples and they are normalized to an integrated luminosity of 139 fb\({}^{-}1\).

The distributions of the Higgs boson decay related variables are shown in Figure 2 for the SM and the four BSM samples.

A flat distribution of the reconstruction fraction would be expected for a fiducial selection that matches well to the experimental selection. However, in order to avoid acceptance corrections for BSM samples, it is sufficient to have the same distribution of the reconstruction fraction as the SM for all samples. This condition is largely fulfilled for the simplified fiducial decay selection proposed here.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{l l} \hline \hline Sample & Wilson coefficient values \\ \hline
1 & \(c_{HW}=-1\) \\
2 & \(c_{HW}=-1\), \(c_{HB}=0.2\), \(c_{HWB}=-0.2\) \\
3 & \(c_{HW}=-0.3\), \(c_{HB}=-0.8\), \(c_{HWB}=0.5\) \\
4 & \(c_{HB}=1\) \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}

## 4 Conclusion

This note presents a Lorentz invariant simplified fiducial decay selection for the \(H\to 4\ell\) channel that approximates the experimental selections in Ref. [4]. More than 99% of all reconstructed events are also selected by this simplified fiducial decay volume. At the same time, the reconstruction fraction as function of critical \(H\to 4\ell\) decay observables is the same for the SM and BSM samples which should largely avoid the need for acceptance corrections for BSM interpretations of the \(H\to 4\ell\) STXS measurements. The simplified fiducial decay selection for the \(H\to 4\ell\) channel presented in this note is optimized to match the ATLAS experimental selection in Ref. [4] and is an input to the discussion of such a selection within the context of the LHC Higgs cross section working group. Hence, until the discussion is finalized and documented, this simplified fiducial decay selection should be regarded as preliminary.
