**Data-Driven Determination of \(t\bar{t}\) Background to Supersymmetry Searches in ATLAS**

The ATLAS collaboration

The Standard Model process of \(t\bar{t}\) production is one of the most important backgrounds to searches for Supersymmetry (SUSY) at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN. We describe new and more detailed results on a method to estimate the contribution of \(t\bar{t}\to b\bar{b}l\nu_{t}q\bar{q}\) events in SUSY searches with large missing transverse energy, multijets and veto against leptons with the first 200 pb\({}^{-1}\) of integrated luminosity of the ATLAS experiment. The performance of this method is evaluated with Monte Carlo data simulated at 10 TeV centre-of-mass energy.

Introduction

High energy jets, missing transverse energy (\(E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}\)) and possibly leptons are the typical signature of R-parity conserved SUSY events at the LHC. The observation of an excess of events with these signatures with respect to the Standard Model (SM) prediction may manifest the presence of SUSY. Due to the poor knowledge of SM cross-sections, parton distribution functions, underlying event and parton showering at the LHC energy scale, as well as insufficient knowledge of the detector itself, a reliable prediction of the SM backgrounds should be derived mainly from the experimental data with reduced reliance on Monte Carlo simulations.

In ATLAS the searches for a SUSY signal in events with a multijet and \(E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}\) signature are classified according to the number of reconstructed leptons (electrons or muons): the search with one reconstructed lepton is referred to as the one-lepton mode, and the search applying a veto against leptons is referred to as the no-lepton mode.

In this note we present a method to estimate the so-called semi-leptonic top (\(t\bar{t}\to b\bar{b}l\nu_{t}q\bar{q}\), \(l=e\), \(\mu\), \(\tau\)) background in the no-lepton mode. This method is similar to the estimation of di-leptonic top (\(t\bar{t}\to b\bar{b}l\nu_{t}l\nu_{t}\)) in the one-lepton mode [1].

Monte Carlo simulations show that the \(t\bar{t}\) contribution to the SM background in the no-lepton mode is about 65 % and the dominating contribution is the \(t\bar{t}\to b\bar{b}l\nu_{t}q\bar{q}\) process mainly coming from the events with a tau lepton (57 %) and events with a not identified electron or muon (24 %). The remainder are events with an electron or muon outside of the detector acceptance (11 %) and events with non-isolated leptons (8 %).

Several data-driven \(t\bar{t}\) background estimation methods have been proposed [1]. Semi-leptonic top background in the no-lepton mode can be estimated by reversing the transverse mass1

Footnote 1: The transverse mass \(m_{T}\) is defined by

\[m_{T}^{2}=2\left(|{\bf p}_{T}|E_{T}^{\rm miss}-{\bf p}_{T}\cdot{\bf p}_{T}^{\rm miss }\right)\]

 where \({\bf p}_{T}\) is the transverse momentum of the lepton and \({\bf p}_{T}^{\rm miss}\) is the missing-transverse-energy two-vector. cut (so-called \(m_{T}\)-method) and by explicit reconstruction of the tau-jet (only the \(t\bar{t}\to b\bar{b}l\nu_{t}q\bar{q}\) component can be estimated).

The method described in this note is based on the following steps. A data-like sample for this study is constructed from a mixture of Monte Carlo samples of \(t\bar{t}\), W, Z and SUSY events, mixed according to their cross-sections. A sample enriched in semi-leptonic top events (_seed sample_) is extracted from the data-like sample by requiring one isolated lepton (electron or muon) and other kinematic criteria, described in section 4.

The _seed sample_ is used to estimate the following components of the \(t\bar{t}\to b\bar{b}l\nu_{t}q\bar{q}\) background:

* \(t\bar{t}\to b\bar{b}\,\tau\nu_{t}q\bar{q}\) events where the tau lepton is in the same kinematic region (transverse momentum, pseudorapidity and isolation) as the leptons of the seed events. This fraction of the \(t\bar{t}\) background is reproduced by replacing the electron or muon of the seed event with a tau lepton and simulating the tau lepton decay.
* \(t\bar{t}\to b\bar{b}e\nu_{e}q\bar{q}\) and \(t\bar{t}\to b\bar{b}\mu\nu_{\mu}q\bar{q}\) events where the lepton is in the same kinematic region as the leptons of the "seed sample", but not identified. This contribution is reproduced by treating the lepton of the seed event as if it had not been identified.

The events constructed from the _seed sample_ events by replacing the identified lepton with a tau or with a non-identified lepton is referred to as the _control sample_.

The two components estimated in this analysis constitute about 55 % of the total semi-leptonic top background. The remaining components include the following:* \(t\bar{t}\to b\bar{b}\tau\nu_{t}q\bar{q}\) events with the tau lepton outside of the kinematic region of the seed event leptons,
* \(t\bar{t}\to b\bar{b}e\nu_{e}q\bar{q}\) and \(t\bar{t}\to b\bar{b}\mu\nu_{\mu}q\bar{q}\) events with the lepton outside of the kinematic region of the _seed sample_ leptons.

These components are not directly estimable by this method. Here, we choose to account for them by applying a scale factor, calculated from Monte Carlo simulation of \(t\bar{t}\) events, to the estimated event yield derived from the _seed sample_.

## 2 The no-lepton mode SUSY selection

We consider the following definition of the no-lepton mode selection. Events with a reconstructed electron or muon with transverse momentum \(p_{T}>20\) and pseudorapidity \(|\eta|<2.5\) are vetoed. At least four jets with \(p_{T}>50\) and \(|\eta|<2.5\) are required, at least one of them must have \(p_{T}>100\) and. The transverse sphericity \(S_{T}\)2

Footnote 2: The transverse sphericity is defined as:

\[S_{T}\equiv\frac{2\lambda_{2}}{(\lambda_{1}+\lambda_{2})}\]

 where \(\lambda_{1}\) and \(\lambda_{2}\) are the eigenvalues of the \(2\times 2\) sphericity tensor \(S_{ij}=\sum_{k}p_{ik}p^{kj}\). The tensor is computed using all jets with \(|\eta|<2.5\) and \(p_{T}>20\) GeV.

The transverse sphericity \(S_{T}\) should be larger than 0.2 to discriminate against di-jet events, the missing transverse energy \(E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}\) is required to be larger than 80 and larger than \(0.2\cdot M_{eff}\), where \(M_{eff}\) is the effective mass, defined as a scalar sum of transverse momenta of the four leading jets, transverse momenta of all identified leptons and \(E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}\). In order to suppress QCD background, the minimal value of the difference in azimuthal angle between the \(E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}\) vector and each of the three highest-\(p_{T}\) jets \(\Delta\phi(j,E_{T}^{miss})\) should be larger than 0.2. The kinematic space defined by the above selection is referred to the as the _signal region_. The definitions of the variables and objects used are given in [2].

## 3 Monte Carlo Data Samples

The Monte Carlo data samples used in this study are produced for \(pp\) collisions with a center-of-mass energy of 10 TeV. The \(t\bar{t}\) events are generated with MC@NLO [3], [4] (hard processes), parton showering and fragmentation are simulated by the HERWIG\(+\)Jimmy generator [5], [6]. The value of 172.5 is used for the top quark mass. The production of W and Z bosons (plus jets) is simulated by ALPGEN [7], interfaced to HERWIG for showering and fragmentation processes. The masses of SUSY particles for mSUGRA bulk region point SU3 and mSUGRA low mass point SU4 [2] are calculated with ISAJET [8] and the event samples are generated using HERWIG. The response of the ATLAS detector is simulated with a GEANT4-based [9] program.

## 4 Seed Sample selection

The _seed sample_ selection is designed to maximize the number of \(t\bar{t}\to b\bar{b}l\nu_{t}q\bar{q}\) events, while minimizing contamination from other SM processes and, possibly, from SUSY production. An additional requirement is that the efficiency of the _seed sample_ selection should be weakly dependent on the \(E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}\) in order to get an unbiased prediction of the background. This requirement is driven by the procedure of normalization, described in Section 8. The efficiency of the seed sample selection is estimated in the low \(E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}\) region, where the contribution of SUSY events is expected to be small, and is applied to the high \(E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}\) regions.

The events of the _seed sample_ are required to satisfy the following criteria: three or more jets with \(p_{T}>\) 50 GeV and one isolated lepton with \(p_{T}>\) 20 GeV (electron or muon). To isolate \(t\bar{t}\to b\bar{b}\nu_{t}q\bar{q}\) events the reconstructed mass of the hadronically decaying top quark \(m_{\rm top}^{\rm had}\) has been used. The method of reconstructing the mass of the top quark in \(t\bar{t}\to b\bar{b}l\nu_{t}q\bar{q}\) event is described in [1], and is based on the reconstruction of the longitudinal momentum of the neutrino assuming that the leptonic W has decayed into the observed lepton and has produced all the measured \(E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}\). The mass of the top quark decaying leptonically is reconstructed by combining the lepton, the neutrino and whichever jet gives the closest reconstructed mass to the mass of a top quark. The hadronically decaying W is formed from the remaining jets, choosing the jet pair with invariant mass closest to the mass of the W-boson. Finally, the hadronic top quark is reconstructed by combining the W with whichever remaining jet gives the reconstructed mass \(m_{\rm top}^{\rm had}\) closest to top mass. For the events with the \(E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}\) and lepton momentum incompatible with W-boson decay hypothesis the \(m_{\rm top}^{\rm had}\) is set to zero. \(m_{\rm top}^{\rm had}\) is required to be within 65 GeV of the top mass.

## 5 Estimation of \(t\bar{t}\to b\bar{b}\tau\nu_{\tau}q\bar{q}\) contribution

The \(t\bar{t}\to b\bar{b}\tau\nu_{\tau}q\bar{q}\) events are produced at half the rate of the \(t\bar{t}\to b\bar{b}l\nu_{t}q\bar{q}\) events, where \(l\) stands for muon or electron. Taking into account this ratio the number of the \(t\bar{t}\to b\bar{b}\tau\nu_{\tau}q\bar{q}\) events in the _signal region_ can be estimated from the sample with one reconstructed electron or muon.

To take into account the additional \(E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}\) and jet, each seed event is used to generate \(t\bar{t}\to b\bar{b}\tau\nu_{\tau}q\bar{q}\) events. The reconstructed lepton is replaced with a tau lepton and 1000 tau decays are generated using the TAUOLA package [10]. Pions, kaons and photons in hadronic tau decays are considered as a single additional jet ("true tau jet"). A lepton produced in the leptonic tau decay is considered as an identified lepton if it is produced in the allowed kinematic region (transverse momentum \(p_{T}>\) 20 GeV, pseudorapidity \(|\eta|<\) 2.5 and distance to the closest jet in the \(\eta\)-\(\phi\) plane \(\Delta R>\) 0.4). The reconstructed initial missing transverse energy is combined with the neutrinos from the tau decay. The SUSY no-lepton mode selection is applied to the resulting sample with recalculated selection variables. To correct for the lepton identification efficiency \(\epsilon\), each event is then re-weighted with the factor of \(1/\epsilon\). The lepton efficiency is estimated from a \(t\bar{t}\) Monte Carlo sample and parametrized as a function of the lepton momentum and pseudorapidity.

In order to check the simplifying hypotheses of this approach we compared the distribution of the transverse momentum of the "true tau jet" in the _control sample_ to the distribution of the transverse momentum of a jet matching the tau lepton in the Monte Carlo truth in the events from the _signal region_. The result is shown in Fig. 1. Reasonable agreement is observed in the shape of the distribution, therefore at this time no attempt has been made to simulate the detector response to the "true tau jet". An uncertainty arising from possible defective modeling in this area is included in the systematic uncertainties (Section 9).

Finally, we compare the distribution of \(E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}\) in the _signal sample_ with the estimate derived from the data-like sample, see Fig. 2.

## 6 Estimation of the \(t\bar{t}\) background with non-identified leptons

### Lost electron

The lost electron is defined as an electron with transverse momentum \(p_{T}>\) 20 GeV, with \(|\eta|<\) 2.5 and \(\Delta R>\) 0.4, not identified by ATLAS electron identification algorithm [11] or rejected by the electron criteria used in no-lepton SUSY search [2]. The electron reconstructed by a standard ATLAS algorithm [11] with the "medium" purity cuts is required to have the transverse isolation energy in a cone of Figure 1: The distribution of transverse momentum of a jet produced by a tau lepton decay in \(t\bar{t}\to b\bar{b}\tau\nu_{\tau}q\bar{q}\) events. The open histogram shows Monte Carlo events with exactly one tau lepton produced in W boson decay, passing the no-lepton SUSY selection. The circles show the estimate from the _control sample_ (only \(t\bar{t}\) component), produced from the _seed sample_ without cut on \(m_{\rm top}^{\rm had}\). Both histograms are shown before cuts on \(\Delta\phi(j,E_{T}^{miss})\), \(M_{eff}\), and \(S_{T}\). Monte Carlo events (corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 1.6 fb\({}^{-1}\)) are generated by MC@NLO. The step at \(p_{T}=50\) GeV is caused by the events with the tau jet transverse momentum exceeding value 50 GeV. These events have higher probability to pass the no-lepton mode SUSY selection due to requirement of 4 jets with \(p_{T}>50\) GeV. The error bars show only the statistical uncertainty of the Monte Carlo sample.

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:6]

SUSY selection. The inclusion probability is shown separately for the muons lost in the region \(|\eta|<0.1\), in the transition region, and in the rest of the Muon Spectrometer. The overall probability of the lost muon to be recovered by the \(E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}\) algorithm is about 5 % and 10 % for the \(|\eta|<0.1\) region and transition region respectively, and about 30 % for the other parts of the Muon Spectrometer.

To estimate the contribution of \(t\bar{t}\) events with a lost muon, each seed event with an identified muon is used to produce a pair of events, one with the muon included into \(E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}\) and one with the muon not included into \(E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}\). The muon inclusion probability shown in Fig. 3 is used to estimate the relative weight of each event in the pair. In addition, the weighting correction due to the muon identification efficiency is applied and the no-lepton mode requirements are imposed to the resulting events.

Figure 4 shows the comparison of the distribution of the muon term of \(E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}\) in the _signal region_ with three estimates - no correction to the original \(E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}\) of the seed events (implying that the lost muon is always recovered by \(E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}\) algorithm), with muon momentum added to \(E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}\) (most muon is never recovered by \(E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}\) algorithm) and by applying the muon inclusion probability as above. The best description of the muon term of \(E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}\) is obtained with the muon inclusion probability. This treatment is still not perfect at low values of the muon \(E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}\) term, but the discrepancy in this range has a negligible effect on the estimation of the total \(E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}\) distribution, since the contribution of the muon term is small.

The \(E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}\) distribution of the \(t\bar{t}\to b\bar{b}\mu\nu_{\mu}q\bar{q}\) events in the _signal region_ compared to this estimate is shown in Fig. 2.

## 7 Purity of the Control Sample and Efficiency of the \(m_{\rm top}^{\rm had}\) cut

As described above, the events of the _seed sample_ are used to generate a _control sample_ which consists of the contribution of \(t\bar{t}\to b\bar{b}\tau\nu_{\tau}q\bar{q}\) events and events with a lost electron or muon.

Figure 3: The probability of a muon which has not been found by the SUSY selection to be included in the \(E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}\) estimation as a function of transverse momentum. The plot shows separately the probability for events with a muon lost in the \(|\eta|<0.1\) region (circles), in the transition region (triangles) and in the rest of the Muon Spectrometer (squares).

Figure 4: Distribution of the muon component of \(E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}\) for \(t\bar{t}\to b\bar{b}\mu\nu_{\mu}q\bar{q}\) events produced by MC@NLO (corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 1.6 fb\({}^{-1}\)) passing the no-lepton SUSY search requirements except the cuts on \(\Delta\phi(j,E_{T}^{miss})\), \(M_{eff}\), and \(S_{T}\) (open histogram). Open circles show the estimate from the data-like sample with unchanged \(E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}\), which corresponds to all lost muons having been recovered by \(E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}\) algorithm. Filled circles show the estimate from the data-like sample with the muon momentum added to \(E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}\) (all lost muons are not recovered by \(E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}\) algorithm) and squares show the estimate obtained applying the muon inclusion probability shown in Fig. 3.

In addition to \(t\bar{t}\to b\bar{b}l\nu_{t}q\bar{q}\) events, other SM events and possibly SUSY events are present in the _seed sample_, increasing the number of events in the _control sample_ and, as a consequence, the background estimate. We consider the following sources of the _control sample_ contamination: \(t\bar{t}\to b\bar{b}\tau\nu_{\tau}q\bar{q}\) events with leptonic tau decay, \(t\bar{t}\to b\bar{b}l\nu_{l}l\nu_{l}\) events with one not identified lepton, W production in association with jets, and SUSY events. The contributions of QCD and Z boson (plus jets) production are found to be negligible in the _control sample_.

Figure 5 shows the efficiency of the \(m_{\rm top}^{\rm had}\) cut as a function of the purity of the _control sample_. The purity is calculated assuming the SM contribution only and with the presence of SUSY signals corresponding to mSUGRA points SU3 or SU4. [2]

The efficiency is calculated as the ratio of the number of events in the _control sample_ derived from the _seed sample_ created with and without the \(m_{\rm top}^{\rm had}\) cut. A \(m_{\rm top}^{\rm had}\) window of 65 GeV has been chosen which corresponds to an efficiency of 57 %.

The contribution of SM processes other than \(t\bar{t}\to b\bar{b}l\nu_{t}q\bar{q}\) is estimated from the Monte Carlo simulation and subtracted from the _control sample_. The uncertainty of this contribution, dominated by the uncertainty from the Monte Carlo, is considered as one of the sources of systematic uncertainty, see Section 9.

Figure 6 shows the distribution of \(m_{\rm top}^{\rm had}\) of the _seed sample_ before the cut on this variable. Each seed event is re-weighted accordingly to its contribution to the _control sample_. The SUSY events contaminating the _control sample_ are rejected when reconstructing the longitudinal momentum of the neutrino. The \(E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}\) and lepton momentum for those events failing \(m_{\rm top}^{\rm had}\) cut are incompatible with the W-boson decay hypothesis. The surviving SU4 peak around the top mass is due to the hadronic top quark reconstruction which selects the configuration closest to the top mass.

Figure 5: Efficiency of the \(m_{\rm top}^{\rm had}\) cut versus purity of the resulting _control sample_ as the \(m_{\rm top}^{\rm had}\) window is changed in the range 30 – 320 GeV. Circles correspond to a sample with no SUSY signal, squares include also SU3 events, and triangles include SM sources and SU4 events. The horizontal line marks the point chosen in the analysis, \(m_{\rm top}^{\rm had}\) window of 65 GeV.

Figure 6: Distribution of the hadronic top mass for events of the _seed sample_ before the cut on this variable. Each seed event is re-weighted according to its contribution to the _control sample_. The histograms are normalized to a luminosity of 200 pb\({}^{-1}\). The arrows show the chosen window for the hadronic top mass. The SM contributions are shown by the hatched histograms (stacked). The SUSY contribution for the SU3 and SU4 mSUGRA points are overlaid. The entries at \(m_{\rm top}^{\rm had}\)=0 correspond to the events with the \(E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}\) and lepton momentum incompatible with W-boson decay hypothesis.

## 8 Results

In order to estimate the number of \(t\bar{t}\) events in the _signal region_ from the _control sample_ one has to take into account the efficiency \(\epsilon_{seed}\) of the \(m_{\rm top}^{\rm had}\) cut used for the selection of the _seed sample_. The normalization factor \(1/\epsilon_{seed}\) is applied to the _control sample_ distribution to compensate the contribution of the \(t\bar{t}\to b\bar{b}l\nu_{t}q\bar{q}\) events rejected by the \(m_{\rm top}^{\rm had}\) cut. This normalization factor is estimated from the low-\(E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}\) region (80 GeV \(<\)\(E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}\)\(<\) 120 GeV), where the contribution of the SUSY process is expected to be small.

In contrast to the other data-driven methods described in [1] and [15], we do not compare the _control sample_ to the data-like sample in the _signal region_ for low \(E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}\). The normalization factor is estimated by comparing two _control samples_: one is produced from the _seed sample_ created without applying the \(m_{\rm top}^{\rm had}\) cut, and the second is produced from the _seed sample_ created with \(m_{\rm top}^{\rm had}\) cut.

Figure 7 compares the normalized distribution of \(E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}\) in the _control sample_ to the Monte Carlo prediction for the \(t\bar{t}\to b\bar{b}l\nu_{t}q\bar{q}\) process in the _signal region_. Due to the possible presence of a SUSY signal in the _seed sample_, the method could give a larger estimate of background than the true value. First, the SUSY events can enter the _seed sample_, and, second, the presence of SUSY events can increase the normalization factor. However, the over-estimate of the background is much less than the SUSY signal itself.

The estimated numbers of \(t\bar{t}\) events in the _signal region_ in the presence of different SUSY signals compared to the true number are shown in Table 1. The total number of \(t\bar{t}\to b\bar{b}l\nu_{t}q\bar{q}\) events is estimated as a sum of the individual contributions multiplied by factor \(R^{MC}\), which takes into account categories of \(t\bar{t}\to b\bar{b}l\nu_{t}q\bar{q}\) background not estimated by this method.

## 9 Systematic Uncertainties

The following sources of systematic uncertainties have been considered:

* Jet energy scale and resolution. The effect is estimated by varying the global jet energy scale by 5 % and the jet energy resolution by 10 %. These uncertainties were propagated to \(E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}\). For the part of the \(E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}\) not associated with the reconstructed jets and leptons we apply an uncertainty of 20 %.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|c|c|c|} \hline  & \(t\bar{t}\to b\bar{b}\tau\nu_{t}q\bar{q}\) & Lost e & Lost \(\mu\) & total & SUSY \\  & \((151.9\pm 1.5)\) & \((30.0\pm 0.7)\) & \((12.1\pm 0.4)\) & \((355.9\pm 2.3)\) & \\ \hline \hline SM only & \(125\pm 12\) & \(28\pm 5\) & \(13\pm 4\) & \(326\pm 27\pm 117\) & \\ SM + SU3 & \(130\pm 12\) & \(28\pm 5\) & \(13\pm 4\) & \(339\pm 28\pm 122\) & \(140\pm\ 1\) \\ SM + SU4 & \(288\pm 18\) & \(42\pm 6\) & \(16\pm 5\) & \(719\pm 46\pm 295\) & \(1773\pm 18\) \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 1: Monte Carlo estimate of the number of \(t\bar{t}\) events surviving the no-lepton mode selection for an integrated luminosity of 200 pb\({}^{-1}\) (numbers in brackets) compared to the results of the data-driven method described in this note. The method is applied to the data-like sample constructed as a combination of generated SM processes only and with the addition of mSUGRA points SU3 and SU4. Individual contributions of estimated backgrounds (\(t\bar{t}\to b\bar{b}l\nu_{t}q\bar{q}\), with a lost electron or muon) are also shown. The “total” is estimated as a sum of the individual contributions multiplied by \(R^{MC}=1.8\). The last column shows the number of SUSY events passing the no-lepton SUSY selection. Uncertainties are only statistical, except for the “total” column, where the first uncertainty is statistical and the second is systematic.

* Subtraction of the SM contamination of the _control sample_. The contributions of \(W\), \(t\bar{t}\to b\bar{b}\,\tau\nu_{\tau}q\bar{q}\) and di-leptonic \(t\bar{t}\) events are the dominant contaminations of the _control sample_. The Monte Carlo uncertainty for \(W\) boson production in association with jets, simulated by ALPGEN, used in this study is 40 %, derived by considering variations of the matrix element-parton shower matching parameters. The same number is used for the uncertainty of the cross-section of \(t\bar{t}\to b\bar{b}\,\tau\nu_{\tau}q\bar{q}\) and di-leptonic \(t\bar{t}\) contributions generated by MC@NLO.
* Monte Carlo uncertainty of the normalization factor \(R^{\text{MC}}\), the factor which takes into account categories of \(t\bar{t}\to b\bar{b}\,\nu_{t}q\bar{q}\) background not estimated by this method. This uncertainty is estimated by comparing MC@NLO to ALPGEN generators.
* Statistical and systematic uncertainty of the normalization factor. The statistical error on the normalization factor takes into account the limited expected statistics of the _control sample_ in the normalization region. The systematic uncertainty of the normalization factor takes into account the presence of W (plus jets), \(t\bar{t}\to b\bar{b}\,\tau\nu_{\tau}q\bar{q}\) and di-leptonic \(t\bar{t}\) events in the normalization region for both the _control_ and _signal samples_. An additional contribution arises from the dependence of the _seed sample_ selection efficiency on \(E_{\text{T}}^{\text{miss}}\).
* The procedure of simulating the tau lepton decay and lost muon and electron uses some simplifications. For example, the detector response to the tau decay products is not simulated. This leads to deficiencies in the estimate of the corresponding contribution, see Fig. 2. This uncertainty is calculated by comparing the _control sample_ estimate of the shape of the distributions of \(t\bar{t}\) events to the shape estimated from the Monte Carlo, separately for \(t\bar{t}\to b\bar{b}\,\tau\nu_{\tau}q\bar{q}\) events and events with a lost electron or a lost muon.
* The uncertainty on the lepton identification efficiency directly influences the results because this efficiency is used to weight the seed events. The electron and muon identification efficiency is

The open histogram (solid line) shows the Monte Carlo estimate, circles show the result of the data-driven estimation. The shaded histograms show the increase of data-driven estimates in the presence of a SUSY signal (SU3 and SU4) and the dashed lines show the SUSY signal stacked on top of the \(t\bar{t}\) background.

varied by 1 % (absolute) and the difference in the number of events estimated from the data-like sample is added to the systematic uncertainty. The statistical and systematic uncertainty of the probability of muon inclusion into \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\) (see Fig. 3) is also taken into account.

The various contributions to the systematic uncertainty are summarized in Tab. 2.

## 10 Conclusion

A new method to estimate the semi-leptonic top background in the no-lepton SUSY search mode is presented. The method relies on the selection of a sample of \(t\bar{t}\to b\bar{b}l\nu_{t}q\bar{q}\) events, which is used to estimate the contribution of \(t\bar{t}\) events with a tau lepton and with a lost electron or muon.

The systematic uncertainty of the method for a luminosity of 200 pb\({}^{-1}\) is estimated to be 36 %, the statistical uncertainty 8 %. The main contribution to the systematic uncertainty comes from the low statistics of the _control sample_ in the normalization region.

The method over-estimates the \(t\bar{t}\to b\bar{b}l\nu_{t}q\bar{q}\) background by about a factor 2 in the presence of low-mass mSUGRA SUSY (SU4), implying that if a signal is found, the measured SUSY rate would be underestimated.
