# Future of the ATLAS heavy ion program

The ATLAS Collaboration

###### Abstract

The primary goal of the heavy ion program at the LHC is to study the properties of deconfined strongly interacting matter, often referred to as "quark gluon plasma" (QGP), created in ultra-relativistic nuclear collisions. That matter is found to be strongly coupled with a viscosity-to-entropy ratio near a conjectured quantum lower bound. ATLAS has undertaken a rich programme of studies using jets, Upsilons, global event properties and measurements in proton-nucleus collisions. This programme will measure fundamental transport properties of the QGP, probe the nature of the interactions between constituents of the QGP, elucidate the origin of the strong coupling, and provide insight on the initial state of nuclear collisions. The currently planned heavy ion program through the third long shutdown should provide 1 nb\({}^{-1}\) of \(\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}=5.5\) TeV Pb+Pb data. That data will provide more than an order of magnitude increase in statistics over currently available data for high-\(p_{\rm T}\) observables such as \(\gamma\)-jet and \(Z\)-jet pairs. Potentially sensitive high-\(p_{\rm T}\) final states will remain statistically challenged and would benefit from higher-luminosity data taking.

### The quark gluon plasma

Studies of QCD at finite temperature on the lattice (LQCD) unambiguously predict a transition at high temperature (\(T\lesssim 190\) MeV) from confined matter to deconfined "quark gluon plasma" (QGP) (see [1] and references therein). Figure 1 shows results of recent LQCD calculations by the HotQCD collaboration [2] of the temperature (\(T\)) dependence of the energy density (\(\varepsilon\)) and pressure (left) and the thermodynamic trace anomaly \((\varepsilon-3p)/T^{4}\) (right) in strongly interacting matter.

The rapid rise of \(\varepsilon\) over a narrow range of temperature indicates a sudden increase in the number of degrees of freedom associated with deconfinement and the liberation of quarks and gluon degrees of freedom. The deviation of the pressure from the massless, ideal gas limit \(\varepsilon=3p\) shown in the right panel indicates the presence of non-trivial interactions in the QGP that are likely the origin of the strong coupling behavior inferred from nuclear collision data (see below). It is not yet known whether the decrease in the trace anomaly with increasing temperature implies a weakening of the interactions in the plasma or the approach to a conformal, strongly coupled plasma [3] suggested by the deviations of the LQCD calculated energy density and pressure from their Stefan-Boltzmann limits. One of the primary goals of the LHC heavy ion program is to provide experimental insight on such questions and, more generally, probe the physics of deconfined strongly interacting matter.

### Ultra-relativistic nuclear collisions

A decades-long effort to create the QGP in heavy ion collisions reached fruition at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) in 2004. A series of papers summarizing experimental results from the first three years of RHIC operation [4, 5, 6, 7], and theoretical interpretations of those results [8] determined that the available data provided conclusive, though circumstantial, evidence for formation of the QGP in Au+Au collisions. Three essential components of the argument were: 1) the matter created in the collisions exhibits pressure-driven collective expansion not achievable in a purely hadronic system; 2) the matter strongly attenuates or "quenches" high-\(p_{\rm T}\) quarks and gluons (i.e. "jets") in a manner that is not consistent with a hadronic system; 3) the final state particle multiplicities are consistent with theoretical estimates of initial-state gluon production and correspond to initial temperatures that are roughly twice the QCD transition temperature. Results from the first two years of the LHC Pb+Pb program have

Right: QCD thermodynamic trace anomaly, \((\varepsilon-3p)/T^{4}\). The vertical band on the left indicates the transition region \(185<T<195\) MeV.

already strengthened significantly the conclusions drawn from the RHIC data, and are providing new insight on all three topics.

A piece of evidence for QGP formation not included in the assessment of the RHIC results was the observation of Debye screening of heavy quarkonia in the QGP. An unambiguous observation of such screening would represent direct observation of deconfinement in action. However, \(J/\psi\) measurements at RHIC have proven difficult to interpret due to the presence of multiple mechanisms that can influence the probability of a \(c\bar{c}\) state forming a \(J/\psi\). There is reason to believe that measurements of the \(\Upsilon\) are more are more straightforward to interpret (see Section 1.2.3), and could probe Debye screening in the QGP.

Each of the above topics is discussed in more detail in the following sections, with an emphasis on the relevance of the topic to future measurements at the LHC and addressing fundamental properties of the QGP.

#### 1.2.1 Collective expansion and strong coupling

Analyses of the collective expansion of the matter created in heavy ion collisions at both RHIC and the LHC indicate that the matter is strongly coupled, with interactions between the fundamental constituents of the QGP much stronger than predicted by perturbation theory [9]. The strength of the interactions in the medium can be quantified by the ratio of the shear viscosity to the entropy density, \(\eta/s\). When \(\eta/s\) is large (small), the mean free path of quarks or gluons in the QGP is long (short) and the medium is ineffective (effective) at generating pressure. An analysis of \(\eta/s\) in strongly conformal gauge theories based on AdS/CFT has suggested a lower bound on \(\eta/s\) of \(1/4\pi\) in natural units [10].

A sensitive experimental probe of the collectivity and indirectly \(\eta/\)is provided by measurements of Fourier coefficients (\(v_{n}\)) of the final-state particle azimuthal angle (\(\phi\)) distribution (e.g. [11]). The \(\cos\) (\(n\phi\)) modulations associated with those coefficients are generated by spatial anisotropies of the initial state in the transverse plane that can arise from nuclear collision geometry or fluctuations in the initial energy density. The conversion of the initial spatial anisotropies to azimuthal variations in particle yields depends on the development of pressure in the QGP, and thus on the \(\eta/s\). Relativistic viscous hydrodynamic calculations provide a tool for calculating experimental observables such as \(v_{n}\) for different assumed values for QGP \(\eta/s\), so comparisons between such calculations and the data provide an indirect method of determining \(\eta/s\).

Historically, the second Fourier coefficient, \(v_{2}\), has received the most attention as large \(\cos\) (\(2\phi\)) modulation or "elliptic flow" follows from the geometry of the initial state in collisions with finite impact parameter. Comparisons of hydrodynamic calculations of \(v_{2}\) to measurements at RHIC and the LHC [12] indicate that at both colliding energies the \(\eta/s\) ratio of the QGP is within a factor of two of the AdS/CFT lower bound and that the QGP is very strongly coupled. More recently, the \(v_{n}\) values for \(n>2\) have received significant attention as the higher harmonics may provide significantly improved constraints on \(\eta/s\). Improved measurements of \(v_{n}\) and other event properties that are facilitated by the large pseudorapidity coverage of the ATLAS detector may ultimately provide sufficient constraint on hydrodynamic calculations to test the temperature dependence of \(\eta/s\).

#### 1.2.2 Jet quenching

The attenuation of high-\(p_{\rm T}\) quarks and gluons (or partons), termed "jet quenching", potentially provides a method for directly probing the nature of interactions between coloured particles in the QGP ([13] and references therein). Scatterings of the energetic partons with individual constituents of the plasma are understood to produce "collisional" energy loss due to the recoil of the struck QGP constituent and radiative energy loss due to emission of gluons. In theoretical calculations of jet quenching, the collisional and radiative contributions to the energy loss are expressed in terms of two "transport coefficients",and \(\hat{q}\), respectively. These coefficients parameterize the role of medium properties in determining these two components of energy loss. An example of how precise measurements of jet quenching transport coefficients could provide unique insight on medium properties is provided by \(\hat{e}\). The collisional energy loss depends on masses of the recoiling medium "particle", so \(\hat{e}\) is expected to be sensitive to non-trivial correlations between the constituents of the QGP that would produce an enhanced effective mass. Then, a precise measurement of \(\hat{e}\) coupled with a proper theoretical modeling could help determine the nature of the degrees of freedom of the strongly coupled QGP.

The lack of jet measurements at RHIC and the resulting ambiguities in interpreting the data have hindered the use of jet quenching as a probe of medium properties. The first jet measurements at the LHC [14, 15] produced spectacular results that have already radically changed the theoretical understanding of how the QGP influences the propagation of high-energy quarks and gluons. In particular, the simultaneous observation of strongly modified dijet asymmetries and unmodified dijet \(\Delta\phi\) distributions has led to the understanding that the QGP can collimate jets by ejecting soft gluons that would normally be in the parton shower outside the experimental jet cone [16]. However, precision measurement of \(\hat{e}\) and \(\hat{q}\) will certainly require \(\gamma\)-jet and \(Z\)-jet measurements, where the photon or the Z provide a precise energy reference for the recoiling jet.

#### 1.2.3 Debye screening

More than 25 years ago, it was suggested that measurements of heavy quarkonia, particularly the \(J/\psi\), could directly probe the Debye screening of colour charges in the QGP [17]. That screening was expected to reduce the likelihood that a \(c\bar{c}\) pair produced in an initial hard-scattering would eventually combine into a \(J/\psi\), and the relative rarity of heavy quarks in the plasma would make it unlikely for the screened \(c\) and \(\bar{c}\) to form another \(J/\psi\). Thus, the Debye screening was predicted to suppress \(J/\psi\) formation. Since that initial prediction, a number of measurements in nucleus-nucleus collisions, both at fixed target and RHIC energies ([18] and references therein), showed suppressed \(J/\psi\) production, but uncertainties in initial-state or "cold nuclear" contributions to \(c\bar{c}\) dissociation, possible production of \(J/\psi\)'s from statistical recombination, uncertainties in feed-down from other hadronic states, and poor understanding of the \(J/\psi\) production mechanism itself have prevented clear interpretation of the data. However, \(\Upsilon\) measurements are expected to be better controlled due to the heavy \(b\) quark mass, and the availability of three \(\Upsilon\) states, which are predicted to be screened at difference temperatures in the QGP. In particular, the \(\Upsilon(1S)\) bound state may survive in the QGP up to \(T_{\rm c}\). Thus, measurements of the relative yields of the \(\Upsilon\) (1S) and excited states compared to \(pp\) measurements may provide a controlled probe of Debye screening and allow determination of the screening scale, \(\mu\). First measurements of \(\Upsilon\) production in Pb+Pb collisions at the LHC [19] show strong suppression of the \(\Upsilon\) excited states and less suppression of the (1S) state, possibly demonstrating the expected effects of Debye screening. Recent advances in the treatment of quarkonia potentials using effective field theory [20] have made possible more rigorous calculations of quarkonia suppression [21], and have led to the recognition that the collective motion of the QGP can influence quarkonia binding and dissociation [22].

#### 1.2.4 Pb+Pb initial state

Prior to first measurements at RHIC, it was argued that the initial particle production in heavy ion collisions at collider energies would predominantly result from copious emission of gluons with transverse momenta \(k_{\rm t}\lesssim 1\) GeV from the strong gluon fields of the incident nuclei [23]. The parton densities in the nuclei at the relevant \(x\) scales, \(x<0.01\), were understood to be high enough that non-linear evolution or saturation of the parton distributions in the nuclei would play an important role in determining the initial states of heavy ion collisions [24]. That conclusion was supported by the early success of saturation-inspired models in reproducing the charged particle yields and pseudo-rapidity distributions in Au+Aucollisions [25].

Collisions between protons or deuterons and nuclei at high energies provide an alternative, more controlled method of studying saturation effects in nuclei, and measurements of forward single hadron [26] and di-hadron production [27, 28] in \(\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}=200\) GeV deuteron-gold (\(d\)+Au) collisions at RHIC show effects consistent with predictions from models invoking parton saturation [29, 30]. However, there is, as yet, no consensus that the effects observed at forward rapidity in \(d\)+Au collisions at RHIC can be uniquely attributed to saturation and the role of saturation in determining the initial states of ultra-relativistic heavy ion collisions is still uncertain. That uncertainty hinders interpretation of measurements at both RHIC and the LHC. For example, the uncertainty in the value of \(\eta/s\) is currently dominated by a factor of two difference between initial-state eccentricities calculated using two different models of the initial state, one of those models being based on saturation.

Measurements of proton-lead (\(p\)+Pb) collisions at the LHC are expected to provide new insight on low-\(x\) physics in nuclei at high energies [31] and to test predictions of saturation models. In addition, \(p\)+Pb measurements will provide constraints on nuclear parton distributions (PDFs) at low \(x\) (\(x\lesssim 0.01\)) and moderate \(Q^{2}\) (\(Q^{2}\gtrsim 10\) GeV\({}^{2}\)) where saturation may not be important, but where the PDFs are poorly known [32]. Measurements of \(p\)+Pb collisions at the LHC will also improve the determination of the impact parameter dependence of nuclear PDFs [33], and thereby reduce theoretical uncertainties in predicting rates for hard-scattering processes in heavy ion collisions. The first \(p\)+Pb measurements are expected in 2013 and follow-up full-energy ( \(\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}=8.8\) TeV for a top \(pp\) energy of 14 TeV) measurements are foreseen in the future (see below).

## 2 ATLAS heavy ion program

The heavy ion program at the LHC provides a unique opportunity to study the quark gluon plasma at the highest temperatures achieved in the laboratory. The initial temperature for \(\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}=2.76\) TeV Pb+Pb collisions at the LHC is estimated to be at least 30% higher than the temperature achieved in Au+Au collisions at RHIC. The high LHC centre-of-mass energy provides sufficient rates for high-\(p_{\rm T}\) hard scattering processes to allow the study of jet quenching using reconstructed jets and dijet, \(\gamma\)-jet and \(Z\)-jet pairs.

The LHC is also equipped with large acceptance, high-performance detectors capable of carrying out measurements in Pb+Pb collisions with a precision never previously achieved in a nuclear collision experiment. In particular, the ATLAS detector consists of high-granularity electromagnetic calorimeters, covering \(|\eta|<5\), a precision silicon tracking system covering \(|\eta|<2.5\), and external muon spectrometers covering \(|\eta|<2.7\). The ATLAS detector is well-suited for executing the measurements required to address the physics topics describe in Section 1.2, and ATLAS has contributed significantly to the early scientific output of the LHC heavy ion program [11, 14, 34, 35, 36, 37].

The future plans for the ATLAS heavy ion program are designed to answer the following fundamental physics questions regarding the nature of deconfined strongly interacting matter:

1. What are the transport coefficients and/or screening scales (\(\eta/s\), \(\hat{q}\), \(\hat{e}\), \(\mu\),...) of the QGP and what do they tell us about the properties of the QGP?
2. Why is the QGP strongly coupled and how does the coupling evolve with temperature?
3. Are there quasi-particles in the QGP and if so, what are their physics properties?
4. Are there non-trivial collective modes or excitations of the QGP and if so, what kind?
5. How does the high gluon density initial state affect particle production and the pre-equilibrium evolution of the QGP in nuclear collisions?To answer these questions, ATLAS will:

* Study the interactions of color charges in the QGP:
* Using high-\(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) jets, dijets, and multi-jet final states.
* Using b-tagged jets.
* Perform precision measurements with \(\gamma\)-jet and \(Z\)-jet pairs.
* Measure QGP response to the passage of the high-\(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) color charges.
* Use quarkonia, particularly the \(\Upsilon\) 1S and excited states, to study Debye screening in the QGP.
* Study global features of the final state using charged particle measurements over \(|\eta|<2.5\) and calorimetric measurements over \(|\eta|<5\).
* Study low-\(x\) and initial-state effects in \(p\)+A collisions.

The connections between the measurements and the physics topics above were already discussed in Sec. 1.2. Generally, successful achievement of physics goals 1-5 using these measurements will necessarily depend on active participation of the theory community. For items \(a\) and \(b\) we briefly discuss specific aspects of the measurements relevant for the remainder of this document.

The understanding of jet quenching is, as yet, insufficient to allow quantitative evaluation of the impact of the measurements in item \(a\) on the determination of transport coefficients and/or medium properties. Nonetheless, it is clear that the \(\gamma\)-jet and \(Z\)-jet measurements will be essential to the successful accomplishment of items 1-3 in the list of physics goals. Those are also the most statistically limited measurements in the above list, so the evaluation of future luminosity requirements below focuses on the \(\gamma\)-jet and \(Z\)-jet measurements.

The study of Debye screening in the QGP ideally involves a measurement of the collision centrality dependence of the 1S, 2S, and 3S per-event yields as a function of \(\Upsilon\) transverse momentum and a corresponding measurement of the production cross-sections in \(pp\) collisions. But, since the predicted dissociation temperature [38] for the 1S (\(2T_{\mathrm{c}}\)) is significantly higher than that for the excited states (\(1.2T_{\mathrm{c}}\)), separation between the 1S state and the others is most important. ATLAS has demonstrated sufficient dimuon mass resolution in \(pp\) measurements [39] to cleanly separate the (1S) state from the (2S) and (3S) states for dimuon rapidity \(y^{\mu\mu}<1.2\). A statistical determination of the 2S and 3S yields is in principle possible, but has not yet been performed in \(pp\) collisions. ATLAS has not yet produced a measurement of \(\Upsilon\) production in Pb+Pb collisions, so the dimuon mass resolution in Pb+Pb collisions has not yet been determined. Studies performed prior to the start of the LHC heavy ion program indicated a mass resolution of 0.12 GeV for \(y^{\mu\mu}<1\), which is sufficient to allow separation of the 1S state from the 2S and 3S states. Currently, the luminosity required to achieve a given precision on the \(\Upsilon\) measurements cannot be evaluated. However, it is certain that precision measurement of the yields of different \(\Upsilon\) states as a function of Pb+Pb centrality and \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) will require at least an order of magnitude more luminosity than is currently available from the first two heavy ion runs (2010 and 2011).

## 3 Future of ATLAS heavy ion program

### LHC heavy ion operation

The current plan for future heavy ion operation of the LHC envisions 3-4 weeks of heavy ion operation per year when the LHC is operating. The nominal allocation of that running time up to the third long shutdown in 2022 as presented by J. Jowett at the 2012 Chamonix workshop consists of:2015-2016: Pb+Pb collisions at full energy, \(\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}=5.5\) TeV, with an estimated integrated luminosity of 0.25 nb\({}^{-1}\)/year.

2017: \(p\)+Pb or Pb+Pb collisions at full energy.

2019: Pb+Pb collisions, possibly with increased luminosity.

2020: \(p\)+Pb collisions.

2021: Ar+Ar collisions.

Not included in the above schedule is a \(pp\) run at \(\sqrt{s}=5.5\) TeV that would provide reference data essential to the success of the proposed physics program. To be most useful, such a run should take place within a few years of the start of \(\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}=5.5\) TeV Pb+Pb data-taking. To achieve statistics for high-\(p_{\rm T}\) measurements comparable to that obtained from 0.25 nb\({}^{-1}\) of Pb+Pb data at \(\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}=5.5\) TeV, an integrated \(pp\) luminosity of approximately 10 pb\({}^{-1}\) would be required. Such running might be naturally combined with a \(p\)+Pb run in 2017.

A conservative estimate of the full-energy integrated Pb+Pb luminosity that will be provided by runs prior to 2019, assuming 2017 is dedicated to a combination of \(pp\) and \(p\)+Pb running, is 0.5 nb\({}^{-1}\). While improvements in instantaneous Pb+Pb luminosity will likely be available in 2019, the impact of such improvements may be limited by store lifetimes. At the design luminosity of 10\({}^{27}\) cm\({}^{-2}\)s\({}^{-1}\) the Pb+Pb store lifetimes will be limited by luminosity burn-off and increased instantaneous luminosity will result in shorter stores. Assuming a factor of two increase in integrated luminosity in 2019, the combination of runs between 2015 and 2019 would yield an integrated luminosity of 1 nb\({}^{-1}\), which is the original goal for the first phase of the LHC Pb+Pb program. The Ar+Ar run tentatively scheduled for 2021 was part of the originally envisioned LHC heavy ion program. The light ion run will produce a QGP with lower initial temperature and smaller transverse size allowing Ar+Ar measurements to test theoretical descriptions of Pb+Pb collective flow, jet quenching, and Debye screening measurements. The jet quenching measurements will also benefit from the smaller underlying event energy density in Ar+Ar collisions.

### ATLAS detector upgrades

ATLAS has a multi-step upgrade strategy that consists of:

* Construction of an additional pixel detector, the "Insertable B Layer" (IBL) that will be mounted inside the current pixel detector. The IBL will be installed during the first long shutdown (2013-2014).
* Phase 1 upgrade to be installed during the second long shutdown (2018) [40]
* Fast tracking trigger (FTK) capable of reconstructing events with 100-fold pileup at 10\({}^{5}\) events/s.
* Calorimeter read-out and trigger upgrade that will provide photon and electron triggers with improved segmentation.
* Addition of new forward muon detectors with better performance at high occupancy.
* Forward proton and trigger/DAQ upgrades.
* Phase 2 upgrade to be installed during the third long shutdown (2022)* Complete replacement of the ATLAS inner detector with silicon pixel and strip detector with substantially reduced material budget and, thus, less multiple scattering, conversions, and bremsstrahlung.
* Goal: achieve current tracking efficiency and momentum resolution with 150 collisions per crossing over \(|\eta|<2.5\).

The IBL and Phase 1 upgrade are expected to provide significant benefits for the heavy ion physics program by providing better charged particle tracking in high-multiplicity events, improving b-tagging of jets, and by providing more selective photon, electron, and muon triggers. In particular, the ability to reconstruct full events with the FTK will facilitate trigger algorithms that require inner detector tracks which are currently not available for most Pb+Pb collisions due to the long processing time required for reconstruction of the high-multiplicity events.

The ATLAS phase 2 inner detector upgrade should provide further substantial benefits to the heavy ion physics program. The reduction of material and improved high-multiplicity performance of the inner detector will yield benefits for all Pb+Pb measurements by improving pattern recognition in Pb+Pb events, reducing multiple scattering, and reducing rates for photon conversion and electron bremsstrahlung. The reduced multiple scattering should significantly improve the \(\Upsilon\) mass resolution and provide better separation between the three \(\Upsilon\) states. Measurements using \(\gamma\)-jet and \(Z\)-jet events benefit from better photon and electron efficiency and improved background rejection.

### Currently planned heavy ion program prior to the third long shutdown

In the 2010 and 2011 heavy ion runs, ATLAS collected an integrated luminosity of 0.14 \(\mathrm{nb}^{-1}\) for Pb+Pb collisions at \(\sqrt{s_{\mathrm{NN}}}=2.76\) TeV. As discussed in Sec. 3.1, the total integrated luminosity expected for \(\sqrt{s_{\mathrm{NN}}}=5.5\) TeV Pb+Pb collisions for the period preceding the third long shutdown is conservatively estimated to be 1 \(\mathrm{nb}^{-1}\), a factor of \(\sim 6\) higher than the currently available data. The factor of two increase in \(\sqrt{s_{\mathrm{NN}}}\) will increase rates for many of the high-\(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) processes of interest and further improve the statistical precision of the measurements. Figure 2 shows the ratio of isolated prompt photon cross-sections in \(pp\) collisions between \(\sqrt{s_{\mathrm{NN}}}=5.5\) TeV and \(\sqrt{s_{\mathrm{NN}}}=2.76\) TeV calculated using JETPHOX [41]. Neglecting differences between proton and nuclear parton distribution functions, the results in the figure represent the expected enhancement factor for per-event isolated prompt photon rates in Pb+Pbcollisions due to the increase in collision energy. That factor varies from \(\sim 2.4\) at \({p_{\mathrm{T}}}^{\gamma}=30\) GeV to \(\sim 6\) for \({p_{\mathrm{T}}}^{\gamma}>200\) GeV. Combined with the increase in total luminosity, the results in Fig. 2 imply a factor of \(\sim 16-40\) increase in isolated prompt photon and \(\gamma\)-jet yields for the period prior to the third long shutdown.

Figure 3 demonstrates the consequences of the improved statistics on \(\gamma\)-jet measurements in ATLAS. The figure shows results of Monte Carlo calculations of the reconstructed \(x_{\mathrm{J}}\equiv{p_{\mathrm{T}}}^{\mathrm{jet}}/{p_{\mathrm{T}}}^{\gamma}\) distribution for isolated photon - jet pairs in the 10% most central Pb+Pb collisions, for the number of pairs expected for 0.14 nb\({}^{-1}\) of \(\sqrt{s_{\mathrm{NN}}}=2.76\) TeV (black) statistics and for 1 nb\({}^{-1}\) of \(\sqrt{s_{\mathrm{NN}}}=5.5\) TeV Pb+Pb collisions (red). The distributions are shown for \({p_{\mathrm{T}}}^{\gamma}>70\) GeV (left) and \({p_{\mathrm{T}}}^{\gamma}>140\) GeV (right). The Monte Carlo calculations were obtained by overlaying GEANT [42] simulated PYTHIA [43]\(\gamma\)-jet and GEANT simulated Pb+Pb events generated using the HIJING [44] event generator run with jet quenching disabled 1. The distributions in Fig. 3 do not include the effects of jet quenching observed in the first Pb+Pb \(\gamma\)-jet measurements [45] which stretch the distributions to smaller \(x_{\mathrm{J}}\) values. With the available 2.76 TeV data, the statistical uncertainties on the \(x_{\mathrm{J}}\) distributions even with the lower \({p_{\mathrm{T}}}^{\gamma}\) threshold of 70 GeV are too large to allow information to be extracted from the shapes of the distributions, though the mean \(x_{\mathrm{J}}\) provides some sensitivity to jet quenching [45]. However, the improved statistics for 5.5 TeV provides \(\gamma\)-jet \(x_{\mathrm{J}}\) distributions whose shapes are statistically significant and which should provide stringent tests of theoretical descriptions of jet quenching. The increased statistics also makes feasible the use of higher \({p_{\mathrm{T}}}^{\gamma}\) thresholds, as demonstrated in the right-hand panel of Fig. 3. The higher \({p_{\mathrm{T}}}^{\gamma}\) threshold extends the \(x_{\mathrm{J}}\) distribution to smaller values where the effects of jet quenching are most pronounced.

Footnote 1: The jet quenching implemented in version 1 of HIJING is generally considered to be unrealistic and therefore not useful for predicting jet quenching effects.

A similar evaluation of the consequences of improved statistics is shown for \(Z\)-jet measurements in Fig. 4 for two thresholds on \({p_{\mathrm{T}}}^{\mathrm{Z}}\), \({p_{\mathrm{T}}}^{\mathrm{Z}}>60\) GeV (left) and \({p_{\mathrm{T}}}^{\mathrm{Z}}>100\) GeV (right). The two panels show PYTHIA+HIJING Monte Carlo distributions of reconstructed \(x_{\mathrm{J}}={p_{\mathrm{T}}}^{\mathrm{jet}}/{p_{\mathrm{T}}}^{\mathrm{Z}}\) for \(Z\)-jet pairs for a number of counts consistent with the currently available data for the 10% most central collisions (black) and for a factor of ten (blue) and thirty (red) increase in statistics. Since the increase in \(Z\)-jet rate between 2.76 TeV

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:10]

\(\gamma^{*}\)-jet measurements off the \(Z\) resonance, where the \(\gamma^{*}\) has a different coupling to quark flavours may, for example, allow the study of \(c\) jet quenching.

Given the current limited understanding of the physics of jet quenching, it is not possible to say at this stage which of these or other measurements might be necessary or valuable in addressing the primary physics goals outlined in Sec. 2. However, if the strategy of using jet quenching to probe microscopic properties of the QGP is successful, additional statistics beyond 1 nb\({}^{-1}\) will almost certainly be valuable in improving the precision of the measurements of those properties. Similar, though more speculative arguments could be made for the \(\Upsilon^{*}\) measurements and measurements of global event properties.

Achieving significant increases in integrated luminosity will be difficult unless the burn-off limitation on Pb+Pb store length can be resolved. The burn-off is dominated [48] by electromagnetic dissociation and bound-free [49] processes which have large cross-sections that vary rapidly with nuclear charge, \(z\). The bound-free cross-sections vary approximately as \(z^{7}\). In contrast, parameters important to the physics being studied, such as the initial energy density or transverse size of the QGP, vary with nuclear mass number, \(A\), as \(A^{1/3}\). Due to the strong dependence of the ion-ion cross-section on \(z\) and the comparatively weak dependence on \(A\), a modest (\(<50\%\)) reduction in \(z\) and \(A\) could substantially reduce the total ion-ion cross-section, allowing longer stores and increased integrated luminosity, without harming the physics program. The reduction in \(A\) from Pb (208) to Ar (40) is sufficiently large that Ar+Ar collisions are not an adequate alternative to Pb+Pb, but the Ar+Ar run may provide an opportunity to assess the advantages of lower-\(z\) operation.

## 4 Summary

This document has outlined a physics program designed to elucidate the properties of deconfined strongly interacting matter, explore the origin of the observed strong coupling in the quark gluon plasma, probe the nature of interactions between colour charges in the plasma and provide insight on the initial state of heavy ion collisions at the LHC. The proposed program focuses on measurements of jets and jet quenching, \(\Upsilon^{*}\) production, global event properties, and studies of proton-nucleus collisions. The currently planned integrated luminosity achieved in Pb+Pb collisions prior to the third long shutdown will provide a qualitative improvement in precision jet quenching measurements using \(\gamma\)-jet and \(Z\)-jet pairs, although higher luminosity running could help fully achieve the stated physics goals.
