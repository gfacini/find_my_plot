**Abstract**

\(MDT\) chambers are forseen to undergo _QAQC_ tests after the completion of their assembly using a cosmic rays telescope. These _QAQC_ tests will be important to monitor the functionality of the assembled chambers and to feedback to the construction site all deviations from expected \(MDT\) chamber characteristics.

This note proposes a set of tests and a possible test site design which could realize the proposed Quality Assurance procedures. The Monte Carlo calculations which were made to optimize the design are described and the relative merits of different solutions will be commented.

A quantitative estimate of the test potentialities of the proposed design are given.

Introduction

In this note a proposal for the _QAQC_ measurements on assembled _MDT_ chambers is presented. The present work was developed in the framework of the _QAQC_ document [1] which includes some of the conclusions described here in more detail.

Although the results and the proposed solutions are optimized for \(BIL\) and \(BML\) chambers, most of the arguments and design considerations may apply to other chamber types as well.

The main purpose of testing the complete chambers is on one side to monitor the stability of the production procedures and, when test site and production site do not coincide, to validate packing and transportation operations. A careful accomplishment of these tasks requires checking both the failure rates and the stability in time of the performance of all assembled tubes.

MDT chambers to be installed in the experiment have to fulfill the requirements quoted in the TDR [2] concerning gas tightness, positioning of wires and current drawn by individual tubes. Moreover the monitoring of the noise level, the efficiency and the resolution over a given period of time with respect to some reference value is essential to guarantee uniform chamber behavior afterwards.

Since the MDT tubes are supposed to be extensively tested at the production site (cf. description of single tubes _QAQC_ tests), in principle no assembled chamber should present any major gas leak or HV problem. The test of the chambers should anyhow include the identification of any tube failing these latter requirements but, since glued tubes cannot be replaced, the only possible action to be taken is to disconnect the offending tube from HV or gas distribution.

In the realistic hypothesis that every production site will assemble one MDT chamber every two weeks, an acceptable compromise between the conflicting requirements of a stability test of the chamber characteristics and the need to follow the chamber production rate is proposed.

Different set-ups can be realized to perform the proposed measurements : the \(RomeIII\) solution is discussed.

This note is organized as follows: The first part (section 2) describes a simple Monte Carlo program used to generate and propagate cosmic muons through the chosen set-up and the software tools developed to select the high energy component of the cosmic muon radiation. In section 3 the proposed _QAQC_ tests and the Monte Carlo results on their feasibility and significance are shown. The design of possible cosmic ray set-ups is discussed in section 4 on the basis of the proposed measurements while the test site of \(RomeIII\) is presented in section 5 together with the proposed working conditions. The time and the equipment required for the different tests are also considered.

## 2 Experimental Techniques

### Monte Carlo simulation

Cosmic muons are generated assuming a flat azimuthal angle (\(\Phi\)) distribution between 0 and 2\(\pi\) and a polar angle \(\Theta\)1 distributed as \(\cos^{2}\Theta\).

The muon energy is extracted either from a flat distribution between 0 and 50 GeV, or from the empirical distribution (from 0 to 20 GeV) shown in figure 1.

A three planes telescope built with RPCs or scintillators is considered for trigger purposes. A rate of \(1\mu/\)cm\({}^{-2}\)min\({}^{-1}\) at the top plane of the test site is used [3].

In the following the Atlas local standard reference system will be adopted: the X axis is parallel to the wires, the Y axis is orthogonal to the chamber plane and the Z axis is orthogonal to X and Y.

The simulation takes into account the geometry of the cosmic ray telescope and for the evaluation of the multiple scattering angle each layer of tubes is approximated by an aluminium foil 400 \(\mu m\) thick. The effect of the multiple scattering from one or more additional thick layers of absorber has also been studied.

The pairs of Y and Z coordinates corresponding to the point of closest approach of the track with respect to the wire are stored as hits. These coordinates are then smeared to account for resolution and eventually used to construct a radius.

In the following the chamber resolution is assumed to be independent from the radial position of the hit and given by a Gaussian distribution whose RMS will be specified for each dedicated simulation. This RMS takes into account both the chamber resolution and the trigger time resolution, assumed to be 0.5 ns or 2 ns for a scintillators based trigger or an RPCs based trigger respectively.

### Selection of the high energy component in the muon spectrum

In many of the tests which will be described in the following a sample of high energy cosmics rays has to be used. This can be realized, as in the \(DATCHA\)[5] set-up,

Figure 1: Cosmic rays energy spectrum, based on data from [4]

with an adequate thickness of absorber. However the multiple scattering itself and the tracking capabilities of the MDT chambers can be used to select events induced by high energy particles.

To study the selection power achievable using a single chamber (with 6 or 8 layers) cosmic muons were generated with the energy spectrum shown in figure 1. A line fit was then performed to the resulting (Y,Z) hits, after smearing the Z coordinate according to a Gaussian distribution with 100 \(\mu\)m RMS 2.

Footnote 2: This number accounts for about 80 \(\mu m\) of intrinsic resolution and about 60 \(\mu m\) from the trigger time resolution. The smearing is entirely assigned to the Z coordinate to simplify the fit procedure.

Figures 2 to 4 present the tuning of a tracking based cut from a fit to 5 or 7 hits out of 6 (a) or 8 (b) on BML or BIL chambers respectively (different lever arm):

* figures 2.a and 2.b show the correlation plot between the muon energy and the \(\chi^{2}/DOF\) of the fit. The plots indicates that in both cases the \(\chi^{2}/DOF\) becomes independent from the muon energy for energies above 6 GeV.
* figures 3.a and 3.b show the distribution of the previously defined \(\chi^{2}/DOF\) for events induced by muons of more than 8 GeV. A cut at 2.6 and 2.2, for BML and BIL respectively, retains 95% of the 5 or 7 hits tracks in this energy range.
* figures 4.a and 4.b show the fraction of tracks retained by the \(\chi^{2}/DOF\) cut as a function of the energy.

Figure 2: \(\chi^{2}/DOF\) as a function of the muon energy for 5 hits BML tracks (a) and 7 hits BIL tracks (b)

Figure 4: Efficiency curves for a \(\chi^{2}/DOF\) retaining 95% of the muons with energy exceeding 8 GeV, as a function of the muon energy, for 5 hits BML tracks (a) and for 7 hits BIL tracks (b)

Figure 3: \(\chi^{2}/DOF\) for 5 hits BML tracks (a) and 7 hits BIL tracks (b) with muon energy exceeding 8 GeV.

Finally figure 5 shows the residuals distribution on the layer excluded from the fit for BIL and BML chambers in three different cases: first without any track quality or energy cut, then for muons above 8 GeV (i.e. with negligible multiple scattering), and at the end for tracks selected applying the above \(\chi^{2}/DOF\) cuts. It should be observed that the non-gaussian tails due to the multiple scattering of the low energy tracks are reduced by the track quality cut. This effect is larger for the BIL (8 layers) than for the BML (6 layers) chambers.

Figure 5:

QaQC tests

To monitor the stability of the performance of the chambers produced and tested over many years it is desirable to adopt a set of measurements whose outcome does not depend, or depends in a well known way, upon the working conditions.

In the following subsections two different kinds of measurements are examined: the first ones are preliminary to decide whether to accept a chamber for further checks or to make interventions on it (acceptance tests) the others to certify the production procedures and to control its long term stability (monitoring tests).

### Acceptance tests

#### 3.1.1 Gas tightness

The chamber and a closed reference volume are pressurized and connected to each other. When the gas inputs to the chamber and the reference volume are closed, a pressure meter directly measures the differential pressure between the leak tight reference volume and the slowly leaking \(MDT\) chamber. Differential pressure meters can achieve a precision \(\Delta\ P\) of \(10^{-5}\) bar and hence, for a typical 300 tube chamber with a volume \(V\approx 400\ l\) the \(MDT\) chamber leak rate \(\Delta_{leak}\) will be measured in 12h with a precision of

\[\Delta_{leak}=\Delta\ P*V/12h=10^{-7}\mathit{bar}\ l/s=3*10^{-10}\mathit{bar} \ l/s/\mathit{tube}\]

This meets the \(TDR\) acceptable leak rate of the chambers

#### 3.1.2 Electric Test

At the beginning of the operation the chamber will be flushed with at least 5 chamber volumes of a gas mixture of Ar:CO\({}_{2}\) in the proportion 80:20 and then pressurized to 3 bars. To reach the nominal gas gain (\(2\times 10^{4}\)) with this mixture the high voltage should be set to 3615 V [6] but for this test the operating volt age could be higher, for example 3730 V (corresponding to a gas gain of \(\approx 4\times 10^{4}\)[5]). The high voltage will be gradually raised keeping the current limited and after some time at the operating voltage (one night) the total leak current will be recorded. This must be less than 5 nA times the number of tubes. If this value is exceeded the offending tube(s) will be identified and eventually disabled.

### Monitoring tests

The tests proposed to monitor the production stability are of two types: the first ones are based only upon the TDC hits information and check the uniformity of the performances of the tubes in a chamber while the second ones exploit the full reconstruction of a track in a chamber or in a set of chambers and require a good knowledge of the R-T relation.

#### 3.2.1 TDC spectrum analysis

Figure 6 shows typical time spectra from test beam data obtained with two different gas mixtures. The distributions are fitted accordingly to the function [7]

\[N(t)=P_{1}+\frac{P_{2}+P_{3}\cdot exp(-t/P_{4})}{[1+exp(\frac{P_{5}-t}{A})]\cdot [1+exp(\frac{t-P_{6}}{B})]}\]

where

\(P_{1}\) is the level of uncorrelated background;

\(P_{2}\),\(P_{3}\) and \(P_{4}\) describe the shape of the distribution;

\(P_{5}\) and \(P_{6}\) represent the minimum and maximum drift time respectively.

The study of the TDC or time spectrum of each tube allows

* the estimate of the rate of spurious hits, either from the \(P_{1}\) parameter for spectra acquired with an external physical trigger or counting the hits entering the TDC spectra in coincidence with a random trigger.
* the measurement of the maximum drift time, from \(P_{6}-P_{5}\), allowing the monitoring of the gas composition stability and in particular of the amount of water vapor.

Figure 6: Time spectra (test beam data)[6]In addition the fit to the TDC spectrum allows the determination of the \(T_{0}\) of each tube (\(P_{5}\)) and the construction of a preliminary R-T relation, obtained from the integration of the spectrum under the assumption of uniform illumination of the tubes [8].

The time required for the signal propagation along the wire introduces a shift in the TDC spectrum, an effect which must be taken into account when events collected over a large 3 portion of the tubes are used.

Footnote 3: With respect to the required time resolution divided by the propagation speed.

The resolution on the maximum drift time and on the \(T_{0}\) will depend upon

* the trigger time resolution, of the order of 1 ns;
* the resolution on the hit position along the wire which, assuming 3.5 ns/m for the signal propagation speed, should be smaller than 30 cm to introduce an uncertainty smaller than 1 ns. This can be achieved with a rough segmentation of the trigger detectors.
* the statistics N accumulated for each tube: typically the error on \(T_{0}\) is of the order of 40 ns/\(\sqrt{N}\)[5][6] while the relative error on the maximum drift time, mainly due to the fit to \(P_{6}\), is of the order of 20%/\(\sqrt{N}\).

#### 3.2.2 Resolution

Using the drift velocity obtained from the TDC spectra a first measurement of the resolution can be extracted (taking into account the trigger time resolution) from the RMS of the distribution of

\[R=\frac{(r_{1}+r_{3})}{2}+r_{2}\]

in \(r_{2}\) slices, where \(r_{n}\) indicates the drift radius induced by a cosmic muon in layer \(n\) and the tubes used to compute R sit in the same position in layers 1 and 3. This measurement is independent from the R-T relation provided \(R\) is computed as a function of \(r_{2}\).

If the efficiency measurement described below (cf. 3.2.4) is adopted the same set-up can be used to measure the track residuals for any tube not included in the track fit.

#### 3.2.3 Auto-calibration

A good knowledge of the R-T relation is preliminary to all the measurements which will be presented in the following. This can be achieved using the standard auto-calibration procedure described in note [9] choosing the trigger telescope in such a way that the tracks have an adequate angular spread in the plane orthogonal to the wires (about \(\pm 5^{o}\)). The R-T relation can be obtained, using high energy particles, via the auto-calibration procedure, starting either from a theoretical R-T relation or from the integral of the TDC spectrum. This measurement checks also the stability of the operating conditions.

Test beam results show that the auto-calibration requires to be stable a data sample of at least \(10^{4}\) tracks, where the angular distribution of the impinging tracksis chosen to be flat in the angular range \(\pm 5^{0}\). Since a cosmic ray telescope selects mainly small angle tracks, the data sample should probably be increased to \(\approx 10^{5}\) tracks.

#### 3.2.4 Efficiency

The efficiency for a given MDT layer to give a signal can be roughly measured using an external trigger on cosmic muons and some rough pattern recognition based upon the other 5 or 7 planes of the MDT chamber. However the cosmic rays energy spectrum is rather soft and very low energy particles can undergo large deflections due to multiple scattering in the tube walls and in the spacer. This can give artificially low efficiencies, which may depend upon the layer in which the tube is positioned.

As already shown in section 2.2 high energy muons can be selected by simple requirements on the track quality using an MDT based tracking. This would also allow the measurement of the fraction of in-time hits among the tubes giving a signal.

#### 3.2.5 Wire location

A fraction of the produced chambers is planned to be inspected by X-ray tomography at CERN. A complementary check, although less performing, could be used for all the chambers which will not undergo the X-ray tomography. This could be based on the use of the distribution of the variable \(R\) defined in subsection 3.2.2 and on the knowledge of the r-t relation. Once a good r-t relation has been found, \(R\), calculated for each triplet of tubes, is expected to peak, within the resolution, at the tube radius. Any mispositioning of the wire in the middle layer (2) would show up as a displaced peak.

The simulation described in section 2.1 has been used to study this possibility. A sample of cosmic rays events with energy larger than 2 GeV and crossing the same tube number in layers 1 and 3 of a \(MDT\) chamber has been selected. This event sample corresponds to few hours of cosmics data taking, as it will be shown in the following.

Fig.7 and fig.8 show the resulting distribution of \(R\) when the wire of the middle layer is displaced by 100 and 50 \(\mu m\) respectively using two different trigger systems: a scintillator and a RPC based trigger.

The top part of each of these two figures shows the \(R\) distribution smeared by a scintillator trigger, assumed to have a time resolution of \(0.5ns\) and the bottom part shows the \(R\) distribution smeared by an \(RPC\) based trigger, assumed to have a time resolution of \(2ns\). The \(MDT\) radius was smeared with an \(80\mu m\) resolution and the drift velocity was taken to be \(30\mu m/ns\), as for the DATCHA gas mixture 4.

Footnote 4: With the slower Ar CO\({}_{2}\) gas mixtures the resolution, and the sensitivity to the wire position, can only improve.

The displacement of the wire is clearly visible for both trigger solutions. However systematic effects could limit the sensitivity of this measurement and should be further studied. Furthermore the poorer time resolution of the \(RPC\) trigger could be compensated on an event by event basis by studying the average track residual in the different layers. Any trigger time jitter would result in an average track residual different from zero.

Figure 7: Reconstructed wire position, initial displacement 100 \(\mu m\)

Design of the cosmic rays set-up

### Trigger system

The choice of the above measurements leads to the following constraints on the design of the cosmic ray telescope:

* time resolution (\(\approx 1\) ns);
* limited X acceptance or X segmentation to correct for the effect of the signal propagating along the wire;
* large Z acceptance to provide a large \(\Theta_{YZ}\) acceptance for auto-calibration and the coverage for all the tubes.

As a trigger detector both scintillator planes or RPC planes could be used. In both cases the coincidence among 3 planes is needed to get rid of accidentals over large areas.

### Slow controls

To control the working conditions it is essential to monitor accurately the gas mixture composition and pressure and the HV stability, which should all be constant within tolerances. In addition there are external parameters which may affect the MDT response, like the room temperature and the humidity, which should be kept as stable as possible and continuously monitored.

On the other hand there may be also some other parameters influencing the chamber performance which may not be under control, therefore it would be useful, when possible, to run more than one chamber at the same time, keeping a previously well checked chamber as reference.

### Working conditions

The following working conditions are suggested:

* Gas Pressure and Gas mixture : To properly test the chambers the gas pressure should be at the Atlas operating value, 3 bar. A BIL chamber has a volume of 550 l; assuming that the test of a chamber requires 1 volume per day (mainly dependent upon the outgassing) over 10 days the total volume of gas needed for each chamber is 5500 l at 3 bar, i.e. 16500 l at 1 bar, which for a gas bottle at 200 bar means more than 80 l. For economical reasons it is then assumed that the tests can be performed using a cheap 2 components gas mixture, for instance ArCO\({}_{2}\) (80:20).
* High Voltage : The HV value should be chosen in order to keep the gas gain close to the nominal value \(2\times 10^{4}\). When choosing ArCO\({}_{2}\) (80:20) at 3 bar pressure the HV should be set to 3615 V.
* Discriminator threshold: Having kept the gas gain to its nominal value the threshold should also be the nominal one.

_Rome III_ set-up

This section describes the performance of a possible cosmic ray test set-up optimized for the simultaneous test of three BIL chambers 8 layers each. The evaluation of the acceptances, trigger rates and tracking performance, is based upon the simplified simulation described in sections 2.1 and 2.2.

### Set-up

The expected _MDT_ chambers production rate is

\[1\ MDT\ \text{chamber / 15 days}\]

The test of one chamber at a time, given this rate of production, allows the above proposed set of tests to be completed at the same rate, but will not allow any stability test of the produced chambers. Thus to test the stability of the chambers a simultaneous test of more than one chamber has to be foreseen. Furthermore one of the chambers under test may be kept for a longer period (stability test) and serve as reference to those which rotate more rapidly (normal test).

Table 1 shows the fraction of chambers undergoing stability tests and the maximum time duration of normal tests for different choices of the time duration of stability tests. Both a set-up allowing the simultaneous test of two chambers, one of which is tested for a longer period of time, and a set-up dimensioned for three chambers, are considered.

A good compromise between the duration of tests and the fraction of chambers undergoing stability tests is clearly possible and the final choice of the solution depends upon how long the stability tests should last. The simultaneous test of three chambers appears more flexible, allowing for longer tests durations or for a larger number of chambers to be tested over long periods.

The _RomeIII_ set-up foresees the simultaneous test of 3 BIL chambers. This will grant both a rotation between the chambers under test, allowing the comparison of

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|} \hline number of chambers & Duration of & fraction of chambers & Duration of \\ simultaneously & stability & undergoing & normal \\ tested & test (days) & stability tests & test (days) \\ \hline
2 & 0 & 0 & 30 \\
2 & 60 & 25\% & 20 \\
2 & 120 & 12.5\% & 17 \\ \hline
3 & 0 & 0 & 45 \\
3 & 60 & 25\% & 40 \\
3 & 120 & 12.5\% & 34 \\
3 & 240 & 6\% & 32 \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 1: Possible tests durations for 2 and 3 chambers set-ups. The production rate is assumed to be 1 chamber/15 days.

the behavior of a new chamber with the behavior of already validated chambers, and eventually the monitoring of some fraction of the chambers over long periods.

Large RPCs are less expensive than scintillators and easier to segment, therefore in the following it is assumed that the trigger is provided by the threefold coincidence of the signals coming from 3 RPCs. Typically RPCs are segmented in 3.1 cm strips, read-out by groups of 16 by cards providing both a fast-or signal and the parallel read-out of all the channels. Therefore the basic RPC module is assumed to be 50 cm along X (one card) and wider than the chambers under test along Z to grant the coverage of all the tubes.

The use of a 50 cm trigger segmentation would allow to cover only some interesting regions along the tubes (central, endplugs...) thus the rates quoted below refer to a 3 planes trigger telescope realized using 50 cm modules. The choice of this modularity allows both the reduction of accidental coincidences and a small error from the signal propagation along the wire (0.5 ns). The information provided by the full parallel read-out of the RPCs is not needed for the proposed tests.

Figure 9 shows schematically the proposed set-up for the telescope:

* a first RPC plane, 3 m long (i.e. probably 2 planes 1.5 m long) and 1.3 m large is positioned on the floor (i.e. at 10 cm from the floor to allow some room for the telescope supports etc...);
* a plane supporting 2.5 cm thick lead blocklets, covering the full \(3\times 1.3\) m\({}^{2}\) area (1.1 t) is placed above the RPC plane to help in selecting higher energy muons;
* the first BIL chamber (41 cm thick) is positioned 30 cm above the lead;
* chambers are positioned at 20 cm distance from each other;
* 30 cm are left between the third chamber and the second RPC plane;
* 20 cm are left between the second and the third RPCs.

### Useful rate

#### 5.3.1 Selection of the high energy component

In the simultaneous test of three chambers a better rejection of the soft cosmic ray component with respect to the one discussed in section 2.2 can be achieved. Different solutions are under study:

* construct three independent track segments, one in each chamber, and cut independently on their \(\chi^{2}\) or on a combination of the three \(\chi^{2}\)s;
* compare the slopes of the three track segments, after some selection on their \(\chi^{2}\);
* construct a track using all the hits and cut on its \(\chi^{2}\);

The first one doesn't require the relative alignment of the three chambers and provides a higher energy cut on muons than in the case of a single chamber, as shown by figure 13 for 8 hits tracks. The other solutions allow to set even higher energy cuts but require the chambers to be aligned.

Figure 12: \(\tan\Theta_{XY}\) and \(\tan\Theta_{ZY}\) distributions of generated (plain histogram) and triggered events.

#### 5.3.2 Three chambers based energy cut

If a reliable relative alignment of the chambers is achieved a \(\chi^{2}\) cut on tracks using hits from the three chambers can be applied. Figure 14 shows the efficiency curve for a \(\chi^{2}\) cut set to retain 95% of 24 hits tracks with energy above 16 GeV.

The rejection power against low energy tracks can be further improved by the addition of absorbers between the chambers. For example two 0.5 cm thick lead absorbers positioned between chambers 1 and 2 and chambers 2 and 3 give large residuals up to higher energies, compared to other configurations, as shown in figure 15. Higher the energy for which the residual RMS curve flattens, higher the energy selected by a track quality based cut.

Figure 13: Efficiency curves as a function of the muon energy for a single 8 hits track segment and for three 8 hits track segments. The cuts on the normalized \(\chi^{2}\) are set requiring an efficiency of 95% above 8 GeV.

Figure 14: Efficiency curve as a function of the muon energy for 24 hits tracks

Figure 15: RMS of the residuals computed on the layer excluded from the fit as a function of the track energy for different set-ups

### Tests duration

Taking into account the slightly larger geometrical acceptance of the trigger telescope with respect to the three chambers system and assuming an average efficiency of 96% to find the good hit in a tube the estimated fraction of events on tape having tracks with at least 21 hits surviving a cut on the \(\chi^{2}\)s of the track segments is about 20%. Therefore the rate of clean events to be used for the measurement of efficiency, resolution, wire position etc... is about 3 Hz per telescope.

Using the OR of the 6 telescopes \(\approx 1.5\times 10^{6}\) good events are taken per day, allowing

* the collection of \(10^{4}\) events per tube for the measurements related to the TDC spectrum (since a chamber has 36 tubes, this results in \(3.6\times 10^{5}\) events, corresponding to 6 h of data taking)
* the measurement of the R-T relation in each layer with \(10^{5}\) events (\(10^{5}\) events, 2 h)
* the study of the efficiency and resolution of each tube as a function of the position along the wire, with about \(10^{3}\) events for each tube in each 50 cm bin (\(2.2\times 10^{5}\) events, 3.5 h)
* the study of the efficiency and resolution of each tube as a function of the radius, with about \(10^{3}\) events in each 1 mm radial bin (\(5.4\times 10^{5}\) events, 9 h)

A complete set of measurements can therefore be accomplished in one or two days, i.e. in a negligible time with respect to the time needed for the installation and set-up of the chamber (electronics, gas flushing, HV conditioning...). If this is really the case these measurements may also be repeated a few times on the same chamber to check its stability.

### Instrumentation

To realize the set-up proposed in section 5 the following equipment is needed for the operation of the chambers:

* gas distribution, HV and LV power supplies;
* on-chamber electronics for 900 channels: HV cards, front-end cards 5 with ASDs and TDCs if available or with ASDs only (plus 900 V ME TDC channels) if not. Footnote 5: The hedgehog cards are considered as part of the chamber under test and are not included in the test site equipment.

The trigger system requires:

* **3**\(1.3\times\) 3 m\({}^{2}\) single gap RPC planes, each plane equipped with 96 3.1 cm wide 130 cm long, pick up strips;
* **Gas**, **HV** and **LV** systems for the RPCs;
* **18**\(16\) channels RPC front-end cards, providing 18 fast-or signals;* **18** TDC channels (VME) to store the fast-or times and the pattern of active telescopes;
* **6** coincidence channels with 3 inputs each, to provide the 6 independent triggers for the 6 telescopes;
* **1** 6 inputs fan-out, to provide the trigger signal;

In addition, to reduce already at the trigger level the e.m. component of the cosmic rays, a minimum thickness of 2.5 cm of lead (4.5 radiation lengths) should be foreseen.

Optionally the electronics for the acquisition of the RPC parallel read-out information (VME registers), could be useful for at least one plane (96 channels) in order to help vetoing the multi-particle events, and for the telescopes 1 and 6 (64 additional channels) in order to improve the angular resolution in the alignment procedure.

#### 5.5.1 DAQ proposal for MDT test

For the acquisition of the MDT time information we will evaluate possible solutions on the basis of availability and costs. In the configuration described in paragraph 5.1 we expect roughly 100 Hz of \(\mu\). Assuming an occupancy of about 2% and the use of a 32 bit TDC, we get an expected throughput value of 8 Kbyte/s. In case the st andard ATLAS read out chain for the foreseen 900 channels would not be available at the beginning of the test of MDT production, we are evaluating a system based on st andard VME TDC modules that have been developed in Rome [10]. Each module contains a 32-channels, 1 ns LSB, TDC chip. The complete read out can be housed in two standard VME crates, interconnected via VIC8250 modules, and controlled by a VME processor (fig. 16). A DEC processor, fully compatible with DEC-UNIX software will be used, both for DAQ and eventually for off-line reconstruction. Most of the hardware and software for this solution is available and we are negotiating the use of a number of TDC modules.
