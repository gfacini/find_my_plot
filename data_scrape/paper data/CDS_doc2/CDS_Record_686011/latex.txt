###### Abstract

Silicon detectors are used or going to be used as tracking devices in many high energy physics experiments. Therefore they are located close to the interaction point, where the detectors are exposed to very high particle fluxes and ionization doses, especially in future experiments with very high energies and luminosities. Ongoing investigations concerning the radiation damage, started already several years ago, include bulk and surface damage related questions. The two main objectives of these studies are: 1. Predict the radiation induced change in the detector parameters expected for any application, and 2. Improve the radiation hardness of the detectors.

A general overview of the current progress of the radiation hardness studies towards these goals is given here.

## I Introduction

Because of the very good tracking performance of silicon detectors, they are the first choice for many ongoing and future high energy physics experiments. Due to the increasing energy and luminosity of these experiments, the silicon detectors will be operated in a harsh radiation environment, with particle fluences up to several 10\({}^{14}\) cm\({}^{-2}\) and ionization doses of up to hundreds of KGy.

For silicon detectors two different radiation damage effects have to be distinguished. One is bulk damage, which is caused by the non-ionizing energy loss of penetrating particles and results in crystal defects. The other effect caused by ionization in the passivation layers at the surface of the detectors is summarized under the name surface damage. While bulk damage is a question of the silicon crystal, surface damage and how it affects the detector performance depends on the detector design and the processes used in the production.

In addition to these generic issues on radiation damage, especially for the usage of silicon detectors in an experiment, it is important to find out what are the crucial detector parameters for a particular application. This depends on the environment, e.g. particle composition and fluence, and conditions, such as temperature and time, in which the detectors are used. For example, the temperature conditions under which the detector is kept during and after irradiation are very important for the depletion voltage, as will be discussed later. Of particular interest in the context of quality assurance is to know the detector parameters which can be measured before the detectors are built into the experiment to give information about the behavior after irradiation. including e.g. the risk for breakdown. Information on these questions is important by itself, but in addition it provides the direction to proceed towards more radiation-hard detectors.

## II Bulk Damage

### General Characteristics

While in the silicon crystal itself ionization is a reversible process, and therefore does not cause any damage, the energy transfer to crystal atoms which is the non-ionizing energy loss of the incident particle causes displacement damage. The primary defects are interstitials and vacancies, which can combine to form more stable defects, e.g. with impurities or to divacancies. If the energy transfer to the primary knock-on atom (PKA) is high enough, say over 2 KeV, so called 'clusters' will be produced, which are local highly disordered regions and behave differently from isolated point defects. For different incident particles, if the energy transfer is above the threshold for production of point defects and clusters, implying the same mixture of defects, the damage scales with the non-ionizing energy loss. This has been verified by comparing the irradiation induced changes in the detector parameters for different particles and particle energies [1,2,3].

Following particle interactions, neutrons, protons and pions with energies above 15 KeV produce cluster and point defects, where the relative number of point defects is higher for protons and pions due to the Coulomb interaction. On the other hand the energy transfer from electrons and gammas of up to more than 5 MeV is not high enough to produce cluster damage. Therefore electron- and gamma-induced damage is not expected to scale with the non-ionizing energy loss, and this is seen in the lower radiation-induced change of the detector parameters and in the different relative defect concentrations [1,4,5]. In most applications the expected bulk damage, dominantly caused by neutrons and charged hadrons, does scale with the non-ionizing energy loss and is therefore characterized in terms of equivalent fluence of 1 MeV neutrons.

### Detector Parameter

The detector parameters which need to be addressed concerning bulk damage are the change in the effective impurity concentration and correspondingly the depletion voltage, the increase in leakage current and the increase in the charge collection deficiency.

The depletion voltage \(V_{\textit{depi}}\), which is defined by the electrically active impurities in the crystal, is an important parameter because it defines the minimum operating voltage for the space charge region to extend over the whole detector depth \(d\) and thus for full charge collection. From the measured depletion voltage the difference between donor and acceptor concentration. \(N_{\textit{p}}\) and \(N_{\textit{s}}\), called the effective impurity concentration,

\[N_{\textit{off}}^{\textit{-N}}V_{\textit{D}}^{\textit{-N}}N_{\textit{s}} \tag{1}\]

can be calculated by

\[N_{\textit{off}}^{\textit{-N}}\frac{2\cdot\epsilon_{\textit{e}}}{q_{\textit{q} }\cdot d}\cdot I_{\textit{depi}} \tag{2}\]

with \(\epsilon_{\textit{e}}\) the permittivity in silicon, \(q_{\textit{e}}\) the elementary charge and

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:3]

\[g(t)=\sum a_{i}\cdot e^{-\frac{t}{\tau}},\qquad\sum a_{i}=1 \tag{4}\]

with the time constants \(\tau\), and amplitudes \(a_{i}\) given in Tab. 1.

Taking the annealing into account for long term applications the bulk generation current can be calculated with a damage constant of \(310^{1+}\) Acm\({}^{-1}\). Higher temperatures accelerate the current decrease and lower temperatures slow it down. Fig. 2b shows good agreement among the annealing measurements for various temperatures \(T\) rescaled to the reference temperature \(T_{\pi}\)=20 \({}^{\circ}\)C using the time axis \(\tau\)=\(\theta\)(\(\gamma\)\(\gamma\)\(t\), with

\[\Theta(T)\)=exp\(\frac{E_{1}}{k_{B}}[\frac{1}{T_{R}}-\frac{1}{T}]) \tag{5}\]

Therefore the expected current increase at the temperature \(T\) can be calculated as

\[\frac{\Delta J}{\Gamma}(\Phi_{J},T)=\alpha\cdot\Phi g(\Theta(T)\cdot\Omega \tau(T) \tag{6}\]

where \(r(T)=I(T)\cdot I(T_{B})\) describes the well-known temperature dependence of the bulk generation current.

The charge trapping, investigated separately for electrons and holes (Fig. 3), shows the same linear increase up to a fluence close to type inversion. While hole trapping still increases with the same rate of \(0.2610^{+}\)cm\({}^{3}\)'s\({}^{-1}\), there is another contribution to the electron trapping causing a slope of \(1.01\,10^{4}\) cm\({}^{3}\)s\({}^{-1}\)[1]. With these numbers the charge collection deficiency calculated for minimum ionizing particles (mips) agrees with the data from charge collection measurements with a beta source [2].

All these irradiation-induced changes of the detector parameters due to bulk defects, depletion voltage, current and charge collection deficiency, have been confirmed in many experiments and are now the basis on which predictions for a specific application are calculated. As an example Fig. 4 shows the changes expected over 10 years of operation for the silicon detectors in the ATLAS experiment at the LHC (CERN, Geneva), if the detectors are constantly maintained at 0 \({}^{\circ}\)C. This, of course, is not possible in a real experiment, although it would be ideal, especially, with regard to the long term annealing behavior of the depletion voltage (Fig. 1b).

For a real operational prediction some maintenance periods during which the whole experiment has to be warmed-up have to be considered. This was first discussed in Ref. [8] and taken into account in calculations of several operational scenarios. e.g. in Ref. [12, 13]. As shown in Fig. 4 [12] the detector depletion voltage, for example at a 30 cm radius after 10 years of operation at 0 \({}^{\circ}\)C without any warm-up will be 270 V. With very short warm-up periods (20 \({}^{\circ}\)C) of only 3 days every year the depletion voltage will only increase to 300 V after 10 years, but with warm-up periods of one month every year the depletion voltage will reach 460 V.

Since the number of active defects created during such a warm-up period is determined by the number of inactive defects which have already been accumulated during the preceding irradiation periods, warm-up periods are less damaging to the detector performance at the beginning of an experiment than after a high accumulated fluence.

is shown in Fig. 4 for two different maximum operating voltages, \(\mathrm{V_{up,max}}=300\) V and \(\mathrm{V_{up,max}}=200\) V. As long as the depletion voltage is more than 50 V lower than the maximum operating voltage the charge collection was calculated for \(\mathrm{V_{up}=V_{desi}+50\) V, with a minimum operating voltage of \(\mathrm{V_{up}=100\) V. The sharp bend seen after more than 5 years of operation for smaller radii indicates the point where the Si-detectors become partially depleted due to the upper limit assumed for the operating voltage. Without this limit on the operating voltage, the only contribution to the charge collection deficiency is charge trapping which is always less than 10% reduction of the total charge. The effect of high charge collection deficiencies due to depletion voltages higher than the maximum operating voltage emphasizes again the importance of the long term annealing effect of the effective impurity concentration.

### _Correlation with Defects_

Now that the radiation induced changes of the detector parameters can be calculated, the next question is: What are the defects in the silicon crystal which cause those changes and how can their creation be suppressed? Two main courses are being pursued to find hints to answer this question, which would have an important impact in the application of silicon detectors in high radiation environments. One is to study the radiation damage behavior of silicon bulk material which differs from the standard high resistivity detector grade, float-zone material, mainly produced by _WACKER Chemietronic_ or _TOPSIL_. The other path, interconnected with the study of other materials, is the application of defect characterization methods to measure important defect parameters, such as energy levels in the gap, cross-sections and generation rates, which help to identify the defects.

A crystal growth process very different from the standard float-zone is epitaxial growth, which is used mostly in the electronic industry for thin, homogeneous, lower resistivity layers on top of a base material. The first study of epitaxial silicon is the comparison of the damage-induced changes with those observed for standard float-zone material. However, it could be more important, that the epitaxial process includes very different possibilities to dope the material with different impurities. For radiation damage studies, silicon detectors were manufactured from an epitaxial material with a thick epitaxial layer of 120 \(\upmu\)m and a resistivity of about 1 kGcm grown on low resistivity Czochralski silicon and their behavior studied [14]. The first results from this study of the depletion voltage versus fluence show a higher fluence for type inversion, possibly due to a difference in the donor and acceptor concentrations. With a sample irradiated with protons up to 1.5 10\({}^{14}\) cm\({}^{2}\) a smaller acceptor increase during long term annealing was observed, but another sample irradiated up to 3.5 10\({}^{14}\) cm\({}^{2}\) shows the same acceptor increase during long term annealing as standard float

The calculations are for 10 years of operation of the ATLAS experiment at the LHC at CERN, assuming an integrated luminosity of 3 years at 10\({}^{33}\) cm\({}^{-3}\)s\({}^{-1}\) and 7 years at 10\({}^{34}\) cm\({}^{-3}\)s\({}^{-1}\). [12]

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:6]

relative number of double vacancies produced by neutrons is already more than 13 times higher than after gamma irradiation.

Another interesting point is the concentration ratio measured for the two charge states of the double vacancy \(\mathrm{VV^{(-)}}\) and \(\mathrm{VV^{(-)}}\) which is 1 as expected in the case of gamma irradiation, but 3.4 after neutron irradiation. Since both levels belong to the identical defect, this means that the lower level of the double vacancies are suppressed if the defect is located in a cluster or at its edge. Fig. 6 shows DLTS spectra measured in the temperature range of the double vacancies, after different annealing steps. The peak for the \(\mathrm{VV^{(-)}}\) at lower temperatures is much smaller than the peak for \(\mathrm{VV^{(-)}}\) at \(-225\) K. During a series of 10 minute isochronal annealing steps from 50 C to 210 C the latter peak decreases, with two annealing stages at 70 C and 170 C, leaving the final peak of the \(\mathrm{VV^{(-)}}\). The defects which correspond to those annealing stages are not yet identified, but possible candidates are higher order vacancy defects, as the two stages are not found after gamma irradiation. Of special interest concerning macroscopic detector parameters, is the observation that the current behavior during the isochronal annealing shows a correlation with the concentration of the two defects which anneal out. As seen in Fig. 6, the visible concentration of the \(\mathrm{VV^{(-)}}\) defect increases during this annealing procedure [22].

Two reasons have been proposed to explain this abnormal behavior of a suppressed \(\mathrm{VV^{(-)}}\) peak in DLTS spectra, one a bonding distortion due to lattice strain in a cluster [23], the other a direct carrier transition which can happen between closed defects in clusters [22]. This example also shows that clusters play a significant role, but up to now little is known about their structure and the mechanisms by which they affect the detector parameters. e.g. by a factor 20 in the bulk generation current (see Fig. 2a). Likewise these differences are clear in Ref. [4], where an attempt is made to describe the gamma-induced and the neutron-induced damage within a defect kinetics model based on the generation rates of V and VV defects.

In standard detector grade silicon the impurity concentrations are very low, and for most impurities below the detection limit of available analytical methods, however oxygen and carbon related defects are important as seen in Tab. 3 for example. Worth mentioning in this context is the ROSE collaboration [24] which has as its goal the development of more radiation-hard silicon detectors, and includes almost all groups working world-wide in this field. To investigate the role of oxygen and carbon related defects, the ROSE collaboration has been successful in obtaining special grown silicon with higher oxygen content, which is currently under investigation.

## III Surface Damage

### _Basic Effects_

In contrast to the radiation-induced crystal defects in the bulk, the term surface damage summarizes all radiation-induced effects in the surface passivation layers, in most cases silicon dioxide, and at their interfaces such as the Si/SiO, interface. Besides the location, bulk and surface effects are also distinguishable by their causes. While crystal damage is due to the non-ionizing energy loss, the surface damage is caused by ionization within the passivation layers and charges trapped in the layers or at the interfaces. The effect of displacement damage, which also happens in the passivation layers is negligible.

The electrons and holes created by ionizing radiation passing through the passivation layer have a high probability for immediate recombination, especially if no electric field is applied. With higher electric field strength the number of free charges increases. Because of their high mobility electrons are swept out almost immediately leaving the much slower holes behind. Depending on the direction of the electric field, more or less holes move to the Si/SiO\({}_{z}\) interface where they are trapped, causing two basic surface damage effects: 1. An increase of the oxide charge \(N_{\mathrm{an}}\), and 2. The introduction of surface generation centers, which are responsible for higher surface velocity.

The positive oxide charges cause an electron accumulation underneath the interface and therefore a higher voltage is needed to achieve the flatband condition, leading to an increase of the flatband voltage of

\[\Delta\Gamma^{\prime}_{F\mathrm{B}}\mathrm{a}\frac{q_{\mathrm{s}}^{\mathrm{ \prime}}d_{\mathrm{ar}}}{e\mathrm{e}_{\mathrm{q}}}\cdot\Delta\mathrm{V}_{ \mathrm{an}} \tag{7}\]

with \(d_{\mathrm{ar}}\) the oxide thickness, \(\Delta\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{an}}\) the increase of the number of oxide charges \(q_{\mathrm{o}}\) the elementary charge. Fig. 7 shows the radiation-induced increase of the flatband voltage versus the bias applied during irradiation, reflecting the described mechanism. This was measured with MOS structures on n-type detector grade silicon with a 220 nm oxide grown in an oxidation process typical for detectors [26].

Knowing this dependence of the radiation-induced surface effect on the applied bias during irradiation, the change of the flatband voltage and the surface generation current have been measured for both cases as shown in Fig. 8a and 8b. As measured in electronic-device related studies of surface effects, saturation is also found for silicon detectors for the basic radiation-induced

surface effects, with a saturation value for the oxide charge of several 10\({}^{12}\) cm\({}^{-2}\)[28, 29].

### Consequences on Detector Design and Processing

Concerning the relevance of these radiation-induced changes to detector performance, it is important to study their influence on the detector parameters. In addition to measurements of test devices, device simulation is an important tool to understand the behavior of different designs under ionizing radiation. Fig 9 shows, as one example, the simulation of the electron concentration, taking into account the radiation-induced oxide charge according to the electric field in the oxide during irradiation. The electron accumulation at the points with a high electric field during irradiation explains, what was first found with proton micron beam investigations of this structure as small dead regions underneath these points [25, 27].

For finely segmented structures, e.g. strip detectors, the surface damage has also an effect on the depletion voltage, due to the electron accumulation underneath the Si/SiO\({}_{+}\)-interface in the gap between the strips [30]. As the simulation for 50 \(\upmu\)m pitch in Fig. 10 shows, the depletion voltage is higher for smaller strip width, or wider gaps. This effect is relatively small for the case before ionizing irradiation (\(\Delta\)V\({}_{=}\)2\({}^{10}\) cm\({}^{-2}\)), but is significantly larger after irradiation, where in saturation (\(\Delta\)V\({}_{=}\)3\({}^{10}\) cm\({}^{-2}\)) the additional voltage required for wide gaps is 25 V for an oxide thickness of 0.22 \(\upmu\)m (Fig. 10a). This number increases significantly for thicker oxide (Fig.10b) or if the gate boundary condition can not be applied and the von Neumann boundary condition exists [30]. The gate on top of a thinner oxide builds a MOS structure, helping to deplete the electron accumulation underneath the interface.

The choice of small gap or wide gap is first of all determined by the application, e.g. if charge sharing or charge focusing on one strip is desired. As well as the consequence on the depletion voltage after irradiation (Fig. 10), account has to be taken also of the peaks in the electric field occurring at the edges of the implant and which are significantly higher in wide gap designs [30]. Up to now it is not known how high the electric field can be without taking any risk for breakdown. This needs more investigation. especially as this risk may be connected to other design questions

Figure 8: Increase of flatband voltage resp. oxide charge (a.) and surface generation current resp. surface velocity (b.) vs. ionizing dose. [27]

Figure 9: Electron concentration after ionizing irradiation. simulated for a detector with electrode overlap for 80 V bias voltage during irradiation. [25]

and to the processing. Since peaks of high electric fields imply a higher risk, it is important to minimize them as far as possible.

Another important parameter for strip like geometries is the interstrip capacitance, which contributes significantly to the total capacitance. Measurements on the irradiation induced change of the interstrip capacitance for the p-side and the n-side of a double sided detector have been studied, e.g in [31, 32, 33]. First of all it can be established that the strips on the p-side are not shorted, even after the bulk inverted to p-type. This can be explained by a thin n-type layer at the surface, which does not convert to p-type, as first suggested in Ref. [1]. It was found that all measurements of the conduction type concerning the bulk show type inversion and all measurements looking for the conduction type right at the surface still show n-type, even after very high fluences. The change of the interstrip capacitance due to irradiation is not dramatic. Essentially no change due to y-irradiation and only small changes due to proton irradiation: On the p-side an increase of below 1 pF and on the n-side a decreases of \(\sim\)1 pF was observed for various gap sizes after proton irradiation up to 10\({}^{14}\) p:cm\({}^{2}\).

Other surface effects have to be taken into account when designing silicon detectors to be used in a harsh radiation environment. Depending on the design, some effects are not important, but each structure used has to be tested for radiation hardness. For example, the punch-through biasing structure, used in some designs for ac-coupled detectors [34], when irradiated up to the saturation of the surface defects shows an increase of the required punch-through voltage of up to 15 V.

Another crucial issue is the breakdown behavior seen in the current characteristic and/or as micro discharge [35]. Guard ring structures [36, 37, 34] are important in this context since they are needed to minimize the risk at high operating voltage due to bulk-damage after higher fluences. A multi guard ring structure is now often used to distribute the voltage drop over several steps. Fig. 11 shows the potential of the individual guard rings under a worst-case condition, where the bias voltage of 100 V is applied directly to the outermost ring no. 1.

This measurement shows no significant change with irradiation, even through type inversion. This means that it is possible to measure the performance of the guard ring structure already in the unirradiated case. For example in the design with equal distances between the rings (Fig. 11), it is found that the inner guard rings have to hold a higher voltage drop. This can be adjusted by spacing the rings accordingly.

## IV Conclusions

An overview of the important bulk defects and an introduction to ongoing studies of defect characterization is given in the first part of this review. The aim of these studies is to develop more radiation-hard silicon, which can be used for applications in harsh radiation environments. The design dependent surface effects described in the second part can only give an introduction to the relevant questions. More systematic studies of the influence of certain design parameters on radiation hardness are needed. Since the surface effects are especially sensitive to the structure of the Si/SiO\({}_{-}\)-interface, they depend on process parameters, e.g. the oxidation, as well. This is one of the questions to be investigated in the future.
