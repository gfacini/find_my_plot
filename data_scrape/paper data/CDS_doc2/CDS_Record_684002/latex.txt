Introduction

In a previous note [1] we have discussed the light propagation using a simple MonteCarlo.

In the MonteCarlo a light ray was produced at the beginning of a fiber, randomly on a section of the core and uniformly in the forward solid angle. This is the simplest model to describe the process of light absorption and fluorescent emission. The light that excites the fiber is absorbed rather uniformly across the fiber since its absorption length is larger than the fiber diameter. The fluorescent light is then emitted isotropically over the whole solid angle.

The light ray is then propagated in the fiber using the laws of geometrical optics. This approximation is justified since the wavelength of the light (about \(500\;nm\)) is shorter than the dimensions of the core (\(950\;\mu m\)) and the thickness of the clad (\(25\;\mu m\)). The program continues to follow the ray till either it refracts to air through the clad (failure) or it reaches the end of the fiber (success).

This program does not keep into account the effects of attenuation in the fiber. In this note we address to the problem of the attenuation of the light rays in the fiber and we will show how different light rays are differently attenuated.

## 2 The light propagation in a fiber

A light ray emitted at the beginning of the fiber and at distance \(\rho\) from the core center will be trapped in the fiber if the total reflection condition at the core-clad1 or at the clad1-clad2 interface is met. Total reflection condition depends both on the azimuthal \(\theta\) and polar angle \(\phi\) of the light ray with respect to the fiber axis. In a previous note [1] we derived the general condition for light trapping in the case of single-clad fiber:

\[sin\;\theta\cdot\sqrt{1-\rho^{2}sin^{2}\;\phi}\leq\sqrt{1-(\frac{n_{clad}\,^{ 2}}{n_{core}}})\]

This relation shows that a light ray is more efficiently trapped if it is emitted near the edge of the fiber. This is shown in Fig 1 where we have plot the number of trapped rays as a function of \(\rho\). At large \(\rho\) the trapping efficiency is larger because a ray produced with a large polar angle can still be trapped in the fiber if its azimuthal angle is large enough. In these cases the angle between the light ray and the normal to the fiber core can fulfill the total reflection condition. These rays will proceed in the fiber along a spiral trajectory confined at the edge of the fiber.

A few of these rays are shown in Fig. 2. These rays will suffer a longer path in the fiber and many more reflections than a ray emitted near the center of the fiber.

## 3 The light attenuation model

We will describe the attenuation of each ray as due to two sources:

* Attenuation in the bulk material of the core (\(\Lambda\)). It is easy to show that the total path of a light ray in a fiber of length \(L\) is: \[L_{tot}=\frac{L}{cos~{}\theta}\] where L is the length of the fiber and \(\theta\) is the angle of the ray with respect to the axis of the fiber. The number of photons emitted at an angle \(\theta\) will be reduced by a factor: \[F_{att}=exp(-L_{tot}/\Lambda)\]
* Loss due to imperfections at the interface between core and clad or clad1 and clad2. A fraction of rays that might be trapped in the fiber

actually will be lost. This number will depend on the number of reflections that a ray will suffer before reaching the end of the fiber. If \(Q=1-\epsilon\) is the probability that a ray is lost in one reflection then the probability that a ray is lost in \(N\) reflections is: \[f_{ref}=Q^{N}=(1-\epsilon)^{N}\approx e^{-N\cdot\epsilon}\] From geometrical considerations only, it is easy to show that for a single clad fiber: \[N=\frac{L\;tan\;\theta}{2R_{core}\sqrt{1-\frac{r_{c}^{2}}{R_{core}^{2}}}}\] \(r_{c}=\rho\) _sin_ \(\phi\) is the minimum distance of the ray from the axis of the fiber.

The total loss is the product of the two losses and the total detected light when the fiber is excited at a distance \(x\) from the photo-multiplier is:

\[I(x) = exp(-\frac{x}{\Lambda\cos\;\theta})\cdot(1-\epsilon)^{N\,(x)}\approx\] \[= exp(-\frac{x}{\Lambda\cos\;\theta})\cdot exp(-N(x)\cdot\epsilon)=\] \[= exp(-\frac{x}{\Lambda_{tot}})\]

where

\[\frac{1}{\Lambda_{tot}}=\frac{1}{\Lambda\ cos\ \theta}+\epsilon\cdot\frac{t \,an\ \theta}{2R_{core}\sqrt{1-\frac{r_{c}^{2}}{R_{core}^{2}}}}\]

Each light ray has a different path and different attenuation length. The light detected at the end of the fiber is the average of all possible rays trapped in the fiber and transmitted to the PM. This effect is shown in Fig 3 in which the attenuation curve of the first hundred rays produced in the MonteCarlo run are displayed, using reasonable values for \(\Lambda\) and \(\epsilon\).

## 4 Determination of \(\Lambda\) and \(\epsilon\)

In order to define precisely the values of \(\Lambda\) and \(\epsilon\) we fit the average ray (Fig. 3) to the experimental points. We use the attenuation curves of a Kuraray Y11 MSJ fiber (Fig. 4).

Unfortunately these data alone are not able to fix both parameters. In fact the attenuation length of the light depends on \(\Lambda\) through the total length of a ray in the fiber. It depends on \(\epsilon\) through the number of reflections suffered by the light ray in its path. Now these quantities are not quite independent. This can be seen from Fig. 5 where we plot the total length of each ray as a function of the number of reflection the ray has done before reaching the PM. Though there is not a one to one correspondence between the two quantities, the average length increases linearly as a function of the number of reflections.

There is a way to disentangle the two parameters \(\Lambda\) and \(\epsilon\) and consists in exploiting the dependence of the total attenuation (\(\Lambda_{tot}\)) on the polar angle of each ray. This will be the argument of a future note [2]. We are now interested only in finding a value of the parameters which will fit the

Figure 3: Attenuation length of a few rays produced in the MonteCarlo run. The average attenuation length is also shown. The values for \(\Lambda\) and \(\epsilon\) are 600 cm and 0.000425 respectively. These values are “reasonable” as it is discussed in the text.

experimental data.

For each value of \(\Lambda\) and \(\epsilon\), we have computed the light curve of each ray (\(r_{i}\left(x\right)\)) as a function of the distance \(x\) from the PM. Then we have built an average light curve by averaging over many rays:

\[\overline{R(x;\Lambda,\epsilon)}=\frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1,N}r_{i}\left(x;\Lambda, \epsilon\right)\]

We have used a least square method to determine \(\Lambda\) and \(\epsilon\):

\[X^{2}=\sum_{j}\left(\frac{\overline{R(x_{j};\Lambda,\epsilon)}-K(x_{j})}{ \sigma_{j}}\right)^{2}\]

where \(K(x_{j})\)is the \(Y11\) light curve measured experimentally. The fit was performed keeping \(\epsilon\) fixed and optimizing \(\Lambda\). The fit was limited to distances \(x_{j}\geq 100\;cm\) to get rid of the clad light (not described in this MonteCarlo simulation). Figure 6 shows the relation between \(\Lambda\) and \(\epsilon\) determined in this way and the best fit to the data for a particular value: \(\Lambda=600\;cm\) and \(\epsilon=0.000425\) that we will use in the following analysis.

The fit is good and we can proceed to determine the average ray in the various conditions in which the attenuation length is measured.

## 5 The measurement of attenuation length

We will distinguish three types of measurements:

* The fiber end at the PM side is polished with very fine sand paper and coupled to PM with optical grease. This is the procedure that we used in most of the fiber scan [3]. In this case it is reasonable to assume that all the light rays are collected by the PM (Fig 3).
* The fiber is optically machined at the PM side and faced to the PM

with no air gap. In this case we assume that all light rays that do not suffer total reflection at the end of the fiber will reach the PM. The angle with the normal must be \(i_{c}\leq 39.26\)2 (Fig. 7). We have used this method occasionally in some tests. Footnote 2: The rays are injected into the clear fiber near its center, because the clear fiber have a diameter of 2 \(mm\), twice the diameter of a WLS fiber. It is therefore appropriate to use the meridian rays approximation.
* In the Quality Control [4] set up the WLS fiber is coupled to a single clad clear fiber, as shown in Fig 7. The light rays that reach the PM will be further reduced by the request that there is total reflection in the clear fiber. Since the refraction index of the core of clear fiber is \(n_{core}=1.58\) and \(n_{clad}=1.49\), the total reflection condition is \(sin\left(i\right)\leq 0.943\)2.

Footnote 2: The rays are injected into the clear fiber near its center, because the clear fiber have a diameter of 2 \(mm\), twice the diameter of a WLS fiber. It is therefore appropriate to use the meridian rays approximation.

The other end of the fiber, opposite to the PM, is always assumed to be completely black and non reflecting.

In Fig. 8 we plot the rays passing the various conditions and, overlayed the average ray, fitted with a pure exponential at \(x\geq 100\)\(cm\).

From the figure we see that the various experimental conditions select different set of rays which have different attenuation in the fiber. The average ray represents the transmission properties of the fiber in these different modes of operation. Table 1 summarizes the attenuation length results.

In conclusion the attenuation length depends on which rays are collected by the PM. The escape angle of the rays from the fiber is indicative of the way ray is propagating in the fiber. Rays which escap

large number of reflections and their effective path in the fiber is long. These are the rays produced at the rim of the core, where the trapping efficiency is large but at the price of a skew propagation. For these rays the attenuation length is large.

Rays escaping from the fiber at small angle with respect to the fiber axis, propagate almost parallel to beam axis, do not suffer many reflections and their effective path in the fiber is nearly equal to the fiber length. These rays suffer little attenuation.

The average attenuation length of rays is therefore a function of the maximum angle covered by the PM. This can be seen in Fig. 9. In this figure we consider a PM at various distances from the fiber end. In the horizontal axis we have, for both plots, the angle subtended by the PM with respect to the the fiber axis. At each angle (i.e. at different PM position) we have computed the average attenuation length and the luminosity of the fiber (i.e. the fraction of light rays that reach the PM).

If we place the PM away from the fiber end, we collect only those rays that propagate almost parallel to the fiber axis. For these rays the attenuation length is large, but there are few of these rays and therefore the luminosity is small. If, on the contrary, we keep the PM near to the fiber, the luminosity is larger but the attenuation length is shorter than in the previous case.

In a future note we will present the results of measurements of attenuation length for several position of the PM. We will show that the measurements confirms the results of this simple model.

\begin{tabular}{|l|c|} \hline Mode & Lambda (cm) \\ \hline \hline All rays reach the PM & 257 \\ Only rays which escape from the fiber & 272 \\ In the QC mode & 310 \\ \hline \end{tabular}
