###### Abstract

The drift properties of the MDT chambers of the ATLAS Muon Spectrometer were studied with data from the H8 Test Beam area at CERN, where 13 MDT chambers were operated for over 6 months. In particular, the t\({}_{0}\) variations were studied as a function of the signal propagation time for chambers with different wire length as well as the stability of maximum drift time after applying temperature corrections.

## 1 Introduction

13 MDT chambers of different types of the ATLAS Muon Spectrometer [1] were operated over 6 months in the H8 Test Beam. The starting point of the drift time spectra of the chamber (t\({}_{0}\)) is subject to changes due to signal propagation delays, threshold variations etc, while the maximum drift time (t\({}_{\rm max}^{\rm drift}\)) should remain constant for a stable gas mixture, gas pressure and temperature. A stability study of the t\({}_{0}\) and maximum drift time of these chambers is carried out with data collected during the data taking period. The precise monitoring of the chamber drift properties is crucial in order to achieve the expected space resolution in ATLAS. The H8 Test Beam at CERN offers the possibility of studying the chambers' drift properties in a controlled way.

For the studies above runs were selected where the beam is hitting the individual tubes at different and known distances from the Read-Out electronics and the chambers' temperature distribution were monitored. The corresponding collected data, which are stored on Castor, were analysed using the ATHENA v8.5.0 framework and a further analysis of the ATHENA output was performed with the ROOT v4.00.08 analysis software.

This work can be divided in four parts. In section 2, a short description of the H8 experimental setup as of July 2004 is given. In section 3.1, t\({}_{0}\) and t\({}_{\rm max}^{\rm drift}\) are calculated byfitting the TDC spectra and obtained for each multi-layer for the various barrel chambers. The propagation time of the signal along the tube wires was computed from the measurement. In section 3.2, maximum drift time is calculated again for each multi-layer of the barrel chambers, taking into account the correction which temperature differences between runs introduce to the data. Finally, in section 3.3, \(\mathrm{t_{max}^{drift}}\) is calculated for each mezzanine card of the MDT chambers for two hodoscope positions and the results are compared in order to see if the difference in the signal propagation length affects \(\mathrm{t_{max}^{drift}}\).

## 2 Experimental Setup

In the present studies we have used the 6 barrel chambers which were installed on three rails, two Inner (BIL), two Middle (BML) and two Outer (BOL) MDT chambers, all fully equipped with Front End electronics, temperature sensors and alignment systems. The chambers are placed with their tube layers perpendicular to the beam line and the tubes vertical to the ground. The Read-Out electronics are on the side of the tube closer to the ground. For a complete description of the H8 experimental set-up see references [2, 3].

Triggering is provided either by a 10x10 scintillator or by a hodoscope array of scintillators. The hodoscope is located in front of the barrel tower, 2.27 m above ground and covers an area of \(60\times 100\) cm\({}^{2}\). Trigger coming from the 10x10 or the hodoscope is received by the Chamber Service Module (CSM) which in turn collects the data from all mezzanine cards of the chamber. A mezzanine is a front end board which receives the analog signal pulses from 24 tubes and performs amplification, shaping and discrimination of signals coming from the tubes. After collecting the data from the mezzanines, the CSM transmits them to the Muon Read Out Driver (MROD). The hodoscope can move vertically, perpendicular to the beam axis and parallel to the tubes. Runs of interest for this study, are the ones which the hodoscope is at different positioning from the ground, which implies that the beam is passing from a different position along the tube wires of the chambers. Bigger distances of the hodoscope from the ground implies larger travel distance of the signal along the wire to reach the Read-Out electronics.

Each chamber has a number of temperature sensors attached, providing temperature readout every five minutes. BILs have 6, BMLs 10 and BOLs 18 sensors, situated at various places on the chamber surface. Records of the sensors' read out values are kept on the test beam conditions database which may later be retrieved for a particular run.

Studies of \(\mathbf{t}_{0}\) and \(\mathbf{t}_{\max}^{\mathrm{drift}}\) with hodoscope vertical scan

### Results without temperature corrections

Four runs were taken with the hodoscope being at different heights.

In Table 1 a summary of the properties of each run is given. In order to calculate the \(\mathrm{t}_{0}\) and maximum drift time for each multi-layer of the chambers, we first obtain the corresponding TDC spectra with a threshold of 44 ADC counts, and fit the spectra with the following function, according to ref.[4].

\[N(t)=P_{1}+\frac{P_{2}\left[1+P_{3}\left(\frac{P_{3}-t}{P_{4}}\right)\right]} {\left[1+exp\left(\frac{P_{3}-t}{P_{7}}\right)\right]\left[1+exp\left(\frac{t- P_{6}}{P_{8}}\right)\right]}\]

where \(P_{5}\) and \(P_{6}\) stand for \(\mathrm{t}_{0}\) and \(\mathrm{t}_{max}\) respectively. Maximum drift time is then defined as

\[t_{max}^{drift}=P_{6}-P_{5}=t_{max}-t_{0}\]

Example data with fits are shown in Figure 1.

The same procedure is followed in all runs, for each multi-layer of all barrel chambers. The values of \(\mathrm{t}_{0}\)s per multi-layer are then plotted against the hodoscope's position. Figure 2 prese

\begin{tabular}{l c c c c} \hline Run Number & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 \\ Hod. Position(m) & 2.2 & 2.7 & 3.7 & 4.2 \\ Beam E(GeV) & 20.8 & 80 & 80 & 80 \\ Beam Type & pions & pions & pions & pions \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}

\[b=4.03\pm 0.11ns/m\]

and similarly for the second multi-layer:

\[b=4.17\pm 0.11ns/m\]

In Figure 3 the maximum drift time versus hodoscope position is plotted for the two multi-layers. It can be noted that while the first three points seem to lie in a range between 652 and 656 ns, the point corresponding to a height of 4.2 m is much lower.

Figure 2: t\({}_{0}\) versus hodoscope position for BIL eta=2 chamber, for each multi-layer.

Similar behavior is found in the other chambers as well. Here only the BIL case is illustrated. A possible explanation to these deviations could be temperature differences between the upper and the lower parts of the chambers. This is investigated in the next section.

### Results with temperature corrections

Previous works [5, 6] have shown that maximum drift time has a strong dependence with temperature. A temperature increase of 1 Kelvin results in a decrease of the maximum drift time of approximately 2.4 ns. It is plausible that such a correction should have an important impact on the experimental data and particularly on the plots presented earlier.

In order to implement the temperature corrections, temperature values of the runs mentioned in the previous section, were extracted from the conditions database. In the analysis we have included one more run for hodoscope position at 4.2 m. Temperature of BIL chambers when the hodoscope is at 2.2 and 4.2 m is taken from the values of two

sensors located a few centimeters away from the edge of the chamber, one at each tube end. Thus, for the run with hodoscope at 2.2 m, the maximum drift time correction is based on the value of the lower sensor while for the runs with the hodoscope at 4.2 the sensor on the top was used. For intermediate hodoscope positions we use the mean value of all sensors. For the BML and BOL chambers the correction on t\({}_{\max}^{\mathrm{drift}}\) was applied using the mean of all temperature sensors of each chamber. Note that temperature values of the various sensors on the chambers deviate less than \(\pm 0.5\) K from the mean.

In the following set of figures, corrections are made with respect to the mean temperature of run number 2 (hodoscope height 2.7 m). Figures 4, 5 and 6 show plots for each multilayer of both BIL, BML and BOL chambers respectively. From the results above it is evident that temperature corrections do not suffice to account for the lower maximum drift time at 4.2 meters and especially for the BIL chamber. Further investigation is needed.

### Maximum drift time computed for each mezzanine card

In order to understand the descrepancies reported before and to check that the results obtained when fitting drift spectra for each multi-layer are resonable, we also looked at the same quantities for individual mezzanine cards of the chambers. We choose a run where the hodoscope was at 3.55 m and perform the same analysis. We then compare the results of each multi-layer with those of individual mezzanines to ensure that discrepancies, especially for the BIL chambers, cannot be attributed to a particular mezzanine. Figure 7 presents the maximum drift times of the 12 mezzanines of the two BIL chambers. First plot corresponds to multi-layer 1 and second plot to multi-layer 2.

The large errors for some mezzanines are due to low statistics. Given the beam profile, the eta=2 chambers have more data compared to the eta=1 chambers. t\({}_{\text{max}}^{\text{drift}}\) of all mezzanines lie in the same range within errors, as expected. In Table 2 we present the values of t\({}_{\text{max}}^{\text{drift}}\) per multi-layer for the two BIL chambers that we obtained by the two fitting procedures: fit TDC spectra per multi-layer and average results of fitted spectra per mezzanine card. Note that for the per mezzanine case, values are extracted after calculating the

Figure 6: BOL t\({}_{\text{max}}^{\text{drift}}\) versus hodoscope’s position, temperature corrected.

weighted average of \(\mathrm{t_{max}^{drift}}\) of all mezzanines for each multi-layer. Values seem to be in good agreement.

We then analysed another run where the hodoscope was at 2.2 m and calculated \(\mathrm{t_{max}^{drift}}\) per mezzanine card. Figure 8 illustrates \(\mathrm{t_{max}^{drift}}\) versus mezzanine cards for the two multi-layers of both BIL chambers. Again, apart from the low statistic mezzanines, all values seem to lie in the same time window. We compare the results with those of run with the hodoscope at 3.55 m. The plots in figure 8 are all temperature corrected. The maximum drift time computed are reffered with respect to the temperature of the run with hodoscope position at 3.55 m. At 3.55 m, the temperature of the BIL eta=1 chamber was 1K lower than that at 2.2 while for the BIL eta=2 chamber it was 0.5K lower. This means that in figure 8 BIL1 mezzanines have undergone a 2.4 ns shift in their \(\mathrm{t_{max}^{drift}}\) and BIL2 \(\mathrm{t_{max}^{drift}}\) a 1.2 ns shift.

In Table 3 we compare the results of the run with hodoscope at 2.2 m when fitting per multi-layer and per mezzanine card. To make the comparison we have calculated the weighted mean of \(\mathrm{t_{max}^{drift}}\), all mezzanines of the same multi-layer report. Values per multi-layer from the two methods are in good agreement especially for the BIL2 chamber where

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|c c c c|c|} \hline BIL 1 ML1 & BIL 1 ML2 & BIL 2 ML1 & BIL 2 ML2 & \\ \hline
652.6 \(\pm\) 0,5 & 651,4 \(\pm\) 0.5 & 653.5 \(\pm\) 0.3 & 652.7 \(\pm\) 0.3 & MEZZANINES \\

we have more statistics.

## 4 Conclusions

This work has verified that the t\({}_{0}\)s of the MDT chambers depend on the distance from the Read-Out electronics the signal has travelled on the drift tube. The dependence is less than \(\simeq 1ns/25cm\). Temperature variations have a significant effect on t\({}_{\max}^{\rm drift}\) values. In some cases, the normalization resulted in a change of the value of t\({}_{\max}^{\rm drift}\) of more than 4 nsec which compared to the error, which is approximatelly \(\pm 1\)nsec in most cases, is undoubtly significant. This means that a temperature normalization of the data is necessary.

The maximum drift times deviate from the expected values for hodoscope at 4.2 m. Temperature corrections applied to the data improved the agreement of the data in different hodoscope positions but did not resolve the discrepancy, especially for the BIL chambers, at 4.2 m.

In order to understand better some of the discrepancies observed we also looked at

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|l l l l|} \hline BIL 1 ML1 & BIL 1 ML2 & BIL 2 ML1 & BIL 2 ML2 & \\ \hline
653.9 \(\pm\) 0,6 & 652,7 \(\pm\) 0.6 & 652.8 \(\pm\) 0.4 & 653 \(\pm\) 0.4 & MEZZANINES \\
651.9 \(\pm\) 0.5 & 652.1 \(\pm\) 0.6 & 652.1 \(\pm\) 0.4 & 652.6 \(\pm\) 0.4 & M-LAYER \\ \hline \end{tabular}

maximum drift time, when calculated for each mezzanine card of the chambers and for two hodoscope heights, 3.55 m and 2.2 m. All mezzanines show approximately the same value of maximum drift time within errors which implies on the one hand that the Read-Out electronics have the expected performance and on the other hand that the deviations of \(\mathrm{t_{max}^{drift}}\) values for the hodoscope position at 4.2 m, can not be explained in terms of an inefficient mezzanine. It should be noted, though, that there is a small deviation between the values of \(\mathrm{t_{max}^{drift}}\) of the two hodoscope heights, when fitting per multi-layer. It is of the order of 1 ns but should not be significant when compared to the errors of each \(\mathrm{t_{max}^{drift}}\) which are of the order of \(\pm 0.5\) ns.
