## 1 Introduction

The method of X-ray scanning for measurement of the wire positions inside drift tubes was proposed at 1990 [1]. The main reason was: it's better to have one HIGHEST accuracy device but do not produce many hundreds of the muon modules with the same mechanical accuracy. In Dubna on base of the computer controlled moving table of the bubble chamber's film scanner [2] the simplest X-ray Tomograph has been assembled and tested.

## 2 X-ray Scanning Principle

For measuring of the signal wire' positions inside drift tubes package we propose to exploit a large _contrast_ (for X-ray penetrating) between Al material of the tube' walls and the bronze or tangstem of the wires.

As it can be seen from fig.1 in our scanning device we detected a "shadow" signal at the moment of crossing wire by thin X-ray beam. The scanning head was composed from the X-ray tube (Cu cathode, 40 microAmp, 50 kV), two collimators (0.05 x 5.0 mm**2 cross sections, 8 cm base) and CsJ scintillator with two photomultipvers as X-ray quanta counter. In the our measurements, fig.2, a package from two layers of the Al-extruded profiles (with 1.5 mm walls) was mounted on the moving table. A signal wires there were inside every cells of the profile ( 70 - 80' microns diameter berillium bronze and tangstem wires were used). All measurements had been controlled by the computer program: fast moving to the next wire position and counting of photon's rate with moving by small steps (10 - 20 microns) near the wire.

The result of the scanning is relation of the "substance transparency value" (in units of X-ray quanta counting) from the "displacement value" (in units ofmoving table). The wire's signal is a very characteristic thin peak. In the first set of the measurements two Al profiles were shifted by one quarter of the signal wire spacing, so the summary thickness of Al was 3 mm: see fig.3(a). The whole curve was scanned here with step equal to \(\approx\) 100 microns, 1 second/point, fig.3(b). Scanning near the wires was done with step equal to 12 microns, 1 second/point; the signal to background ratio was 50%, fig.3(c).

In the second measurement the shift between tubes was equal to one half of the pitch. In this case there was 11 mm of Al under the each wire, see fig. 4(a), and signal to background ratio was 30%, fig.4(c).

The real accuracy of wire's relative positioning was defined, of course, by an intrinsic measurement error's value of the moving table (we had near 5 - 6 microns).

## 3 How to Make Use of It

We think this methodic can be used for the same aim as a "comb" or other high accuracy mechanical structures (see [3], [4]) are used in the coordinate drift tubes modules. In every cross sections of module where the wire's supports are placed the relative positions of the signal wires can be measured with accuracy defined by the commercial moving device ( for example, \(\pm\) 5 microns on distance 2 meters, [5])1

Footnote 1: We know, in general, two-dimensional positioning of the signal wires is needed. We are ready to resolve this problem.

During the scanning positions of RASNIK alignment system's optic elements can be measured also. For this aim the optic elements need to have special reference marks ("X-ray targets").

To make a total coordinate calibration of module we need to resolve the problem: how to combine all cross section measurements into a common reference system? Very naturally it can be done with help of Internal alignment system of module: at least two RASNIK channels combine outer and inner wires supports' "combs" in common reference system of module.

So, positions of the drift tubes' signal wires can be directly connected with alignment & monitoring systems of spectrometer's tower.

In frame of R&D program before writing of the Technical Proposal we are going to test a small prototype of the X-ray scanner. It will be suitable for scanning some prototypes of muon detector's modules, see [6]. The aims of this work are:

1. Elaboration of the X-ray scanning methodic for measurement positions of signal wires and optic elements in the module.
2. Control of mechanic accuracy of wire's positioning in the prototypes of the muon module.
