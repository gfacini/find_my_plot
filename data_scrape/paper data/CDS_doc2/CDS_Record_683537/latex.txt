**Introduction**

The accuracy of muon momentum reconstruction in the air-core toroid muon system depends on many parameters. One of these is the rates of background particles. Background hits can "spoil" muon hits. A background hit may be selected during the pattern recognition phase of muon track reconstruction. In such cases an error in the reconstructed muon momentum may be larger then expected from nominal coordinate measurement accuracy of the muon system.

The problem of average background rates in air-core toroid muon system from minimum bias events was considered in ref[1]. The uncorrelated background rates will be sufficiently small. For example, at \(\eta=0\) the probability of a background hit in tube ( of diameter 2 cm, 200 cm lenght and mean drift time of 125 ns) will be about \(5\cdot 10^{-4}\).

Background rates can drastically increase however for events where a muon is close to a high energy hadron jet ( for example in semileptonic decays of heavy quarks ). For a reasonable consideration of such a problem it is necessary to implement a procedure of muon pattern recognition.

In the framework of the SLUG/GEANT environment a program ( MUONRC ) has been developed for single muon track recognition and momentum estimation based on the hits collected from the air-core toroid muon chambers. As a first step of investigation the response function of the air-core toroid muon system at zero pseudorapidity was studied [2]. The current Note describes results of an investigation of the efficiency of muon reconstruction in air-core toroid for muons from \(b-\)decays. Events with production of \(b\overline{b}\) and subsequent decay of \(b\,\rightarrow\,\mu\,+\,X\) were generated using PYTHIA and then a complete GEANT simulation was made. Results are presented for different \(p_{t}\) cuts and different calorimeter thicknesses.

## 2 Event simulation

To speed up the hadron tracking in calorimeters with GEANT, a simple description of the calorimeter system geometry was used. The material of electromagnetic and hadron calorimeters including the tail-catcher was describe as a tube of iron. The tracking of electromagnetic showers in GEANT was made only for outer layer of the tube with a thickness of 20\(cm\). Such a thickness is reasonable for an adequate simulation of electromagnetic shower background [3].

The muon system considered consists of three "mattresses". Each mattress includes two superlayers of drift tubes separated by a distance of 40 \(cm\). The coordinate measurement accuracy of each superlayer was expected to be 0.01 \(cm\) with an 8 \(mrad\) angular resolution. The dimensions of the drift tubes also were taken into account by making the width of strip of the same order as the drift tube diameter. Each superlayer was divided into strips oriented along the \(B-\)field, with only the hits closest to the center of the strip selected.

The radial dimension of the air-core toroid used was 5 \(m\) with the field integral set to 3 \(T\cdot m\). The analysis was performed assuming a homogeneous toroidal magnetic field, therefore the muon trajectories were approximated by circles in the bending plane.

The kinetic energy of particles with angles smaller then 0.25 \(mrad\) with respect to muon (see Fig.1) were summed to define the hadron kinetic energy of the jet, \(E_{h}\). Muons accompanied by jet with bigger \(E_{h}\) in every event was considered. Events were selected with muons having \(|\eta|<0.5\) and \(10<p_{\mu}<100GeV/c\). Particles having an angle with respect to muon smaller then 0.5 \(rad\) were tracked by GEANT.

The events were generated by PYTHIA with \(p_{t}\) cuts of 100 \(GeV/c\) and 300 \(GeV/c\). Mean values of muon momentum and hadron kinetic energy in jet were \(\overline{p_{\mu}}=\)31 \(GeV/c\), \(\overline{E_{h}}=\)75 \(GeV/c\) for \(p_{t}>\)100 \(GeV/c\) and \(\overline{p_{\mu}}=\)40 \(GeV/c\), \(\overline{E_{h}}=\)85 \(GeV/c\) for \(p_{t}>300\)\(GeV/c\) (Fig. 2-5).

**3 Method of analysis and results**

Background hits in the muon chambers were produced by electromagnetic activity accompanying the muon itself, decay muons from pion and kaon decay, and hadron leakage from the calorimeter system. As shown in Fig.6 distribution probability of background particle momentum to be higher then 20 \(GeV/c\) is about 0.1.

All possible muon trajectories were fitted, whilst excluding the layer closest to the calorimeter, and sample of hits with the best residuals was selected as the "real" muon trajectory. The muon momentum was obtained from the curvature of the muon trajectory in the magnetic field. The intersection of the muon trajectory with beam line was then defined. Muons with z-coordinates at the intersection point of smaller then 20 \(cm\) (see Fig.7) were selected for further analysis.

The reconstructed muon momentum, \(p_{ee}\), was compared ( Fig. 8) with the exact value of the muon momentum \(p_{ee}\) before the toroid ( after the calorimeters ). The spoiling of muon hits by background particle hits confusing the muon pattern recognition gives rise to momentum reconstruction errors.

As demonstrated in Fig.10 the relative error of the muon momentum reconstruction in the air-core toroid depends linearly on muon momentum.We used a momentum independent parametrisation

\[f_{r}=10^{4}\cdot(p_{ee}-p_{ee})/p_{ee}^{2}\]

as a function for the quality of muon momentum reconstruction. Muon momenta were considered as correctly reconstructed if \(|f_{r}|<11\) (see Fig.10). The ratio of number of events with correctly reconstructed momenta to the number of all events defines the muon momentum reconstruction efficiency.

As can be seen from Fig. 11, the probability to have at least one background hit in first superlayer of muon system is observed to sharply increase for small calorimeter thicknesses. The background particles spoiling the muon hits are mainly electrons (see Fig. 12) produced by electromagnetic activity accompanying the muon itself. The probability to spoil muon hit has a very slow dependence on calorimeter thickness (Fig. 13).

First of all, the reconstruction efficiency of single muon from \(b-\)decay (hadrons were not tracked by GEANT) was estimated.It was found to be 0.990\(\pm\)0.005.

For incorrectly reconstructed events with \(b-\)jets the composition of selected in muon track hits was investigated. In some of them all hits were selected from considered muon.The ratio of number of such events to the number of all events may be used as estimation of inefficiency of reconstruction program for the given method of analysis. This inefficiency was found to be 0.007\(\pm\)0.002.

The distribution of tracking type (from GEANT) for background hits selected in incorrectly reconstructed muon tracks are presented on Fig. 14, 15. The distribution are different but the fraction of incorrectly reconstructed events is approximatly the same for calorimeter thicknesses 8\(\lambda\), 10\(\lambda\) and 12\(\lambda\) (Fig.16).

In the limit of statistics of the Monte Carlo calculation, there is no dependence of the efficiency of muon reconstruction on calorimeter thickness.

## 4 Conclusion

For considered geometry and measurement accuracy of muon chambers the efficiency of correct muon momentum reconstruction can be sufficiently high for muon accompanied by jet (0.98-0.99).

The results of Monte Carlo simulation of events with \(b\)-jets indicate very slow dependence of the efficiency of muon patern recognition and correct muon momentum reconstruction on calorimeter system thickness in the range from 8\(\lambda\) to 12\(\lambda\).
