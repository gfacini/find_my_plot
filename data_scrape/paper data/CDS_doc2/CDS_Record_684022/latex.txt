Introduction

The use of b-jet tagging selection at LVL2/EF could provide additional flexibility and thus possibly better performance with respect to the standard strategy. In particular, for topologies containing multi b-jets, the ability to separate, at LVL2/EF, b-jets from jets generated by gluons and light quarks could allow a relaxation of the jet trigger thresholds at LVL1/LVL2 (based on E\({}_{T}\) ), and hence lead to an increase of the acceptance. The study presented here covers only the LVL2 part. This choice is justified by the fact that b-tagging at LVL2 is the most critical issue since it requires a fast track reconstruction in the LVL2 latency.

## 2 \(b\)-tagging at LVL2

The reconstruction of the impact parameter in the transverse plane (\(d_{0}\)) is the basic component for a b-jet trigger. The optimal way to obtain this information is through a complete track reconstruction and track fit using the whole of the inner detector. However, this approach may prove difficult on account of the computing power needed and volume of data accessed. There are significant advantages in algorithms based solely on the pixel system (PixTrig) [1], which take advantage of the three-dimensional space-points.

In this note presents a feasibility of a b-jet trigger based uniquely on the pixel information is examined.

### Track reconstruction in the LVL1 RoI

The standard RoI from the LVL1 jet trigger is the region defined by the lines family having distance \((\Delta\eta,\Delta\phi,\Delta z)=(0.5,0.5rad,7cm)\) with respect the line joining the center of the calorimeter spot to center of the coordinates \((x,y,z)=(0,0,0)\).

The jet-RoI are selected by the jet trigger menus: (j180,3j75,4j55) and (j290,3j130,4j90) at low and high luminosity respectively. The first number indicate the multiplicity of the trigger while the number after the j indicates the value of the cut on the "true" transverse energy E\({}_{T}\), the cuts on the E\({}_{T}\) reconstructed at LVL1 are chosen in order to give 95% efficiency for a certain "true" E\({}_{T}\). In practice, the cut on the LVL1 E\({}_{T}\) is 20 \(GeV\) lower than desired "true" E\({}_{T}\) threshold.

For this study Atrig [2] (the standard trigger simulation program in ATLAS) has been run with a dummy single jet trigger (j35) in order to select every jet RoI with E\({}_{T}\) above 35 \(GeV\). The output of the LVL1 has been then analyzed by CTrig [3], a C/C++ program for LVL2 studies.

In this framework PixTrig performs a complete tracks reconstruction at LVL2 using the space points (clusters) detected by the Pixels detector.

The steps of the algorithm are the follwing:

* tracks reconstruction: every possible triplet of points (each in different layers of the pixel detector) that are compatible to belong to a reconstructed track with \(p_{T}~{}>~{}2~{}GeV/c\) is selected,* ambiguites removal: ambiguities on the track association (hits sharing between different triplets) are removed on the basis of the quality of the reconstructed track,
* for each triplet the standard track parameter (\(d_{0},z_{0},\phi\),\(\eta\),\(1/p_{T}\)) are calculated and the b-tagging algorithm is run. The tracks having all the three points associated to the same simulated track are called "good" tracks, the remaining ones are called "fake" tracks.
*

The LVL1 muon validation, available in PixTrig, has been disabled since multi-jet events (the sample of interest for this trigger) contain, usually, soft b-jets that are unlikely to produce muon that will pass the trigger.

### Definition of b-jets and u-jets

The standard sample for b-tagging studies are b-jets (signal) and u-jets (background) from Higgs boson decays with mass of \(100~{}GeV/c^{2}\) produced in association with a \(W\). This choice is driven by the fact that the discovery potential of an Higgs boson decaying in \(b\bar{b}\) is significative in a mass window of \([90,130]~{}GeV/c\).

The identification between RoI and jets is not uniquely defined. A generic x-quark in the final state of an interaction or a decay can radiate gluons and therefore change the direction. An RoI from \(H\to b\bar{b}\) or \(H\to u\bar{u}\) is labelled as x-jet (\(x=b,u\)) if a x-quark from the original hard process pointed, after final state radiation, along the RoI direction within an angular distance if \(\Delta R<0.2\) (\(\Delta R=\sqrt{\Delta\eta^{2}+\Delta\phi^{2}}\)). This definition, coherent with the one used by the Offline, has been adopted in order to ease the comparison of the Offline and Trigger result.

### b-tagging algorithm

Tracks from b-jets and u-jets are usually discriminated by the value of the impact parameter \(d_{0}\) in the plane \(R\phi\), defined as the minimum distance between the track and the primary vertex (assumed in the coordinate \((0,0)\)).

Since the b hadrons have finite lifetime, the tracks coming from their decays are characterized by large of \(d_{0}\) while tracks coming from u-jets are dominantly coming from the primary vertex (\(d_{0}=0\)). Figure 1 shows the distribution of the absolute value of \(d_{0}\) for b-jets and u-jets. A general variable \(S(d_{0})\) based on \(d_{0}\) can discriminate between u-jets and b-jets.

A simple \(b\)-tagging algorithm can be built using the likelihood ratio method. For each track the ratio of the probability densities for the track to come from a \(b\)-jet or a \(u\)-jet is calculated: \(f_{b}(S_{i})/f_{u}(S_{i})\); the product \(W\) of these ratio over all reconstructed tracks in the jet is computed and the final tagging variable \(X=W/(1+W)\) is defined. \(b\)-jets (\(u\)-jets) are tagged by \(X\simeq 1\) (\(X\simeq 0\)).

The b-tagging algorithm is then characterized in two ways:

* the rejection on u-jets, defined as the inverse of the efficiency on those jets (\(R_{u}=1/\epsilon_{u}\)), as function of the efficiency on b-jets (\(\epsilon_{b}\)).

* the rejection \(R_{\rm u}\) in different \({\rm E}_{T}\) and \(\eta\) intervals for fixed efficiency. This kind of information allow to computed with the "rule of thumb" the expected rejection for a certain physics channel when the kinematic is known.

## 3 b-tagging at low luminosity

### Track reconstruction

The quality of the track reconstruction is shown in Figure 2, as a function of \(\eta\) and \(p_{T}\) of the tracks.

The efficiency is defined as the number of "good" tracks reconstructed of the number of simulated tracks having three hits in different layers of the pixel detector.

### Optimal definition of the b-tagging variable

Different choices can be made for the variable in the b-tagging algorithm:

* \(|\!|d_{0}|\!|\): the absolute value of \(d_{0}\) is simply used.
* \(d_{0}/\sigma\,(p_{T})\) ( also called significance): since the error on \(d_{0}\) is not defined on the reconstructed track (three point give one and only one circle), the uncertainty on the impact parameter as been parametrized as a function of the reconstructed \(p_{T}\) (Figure 3-a).

The impact of these two choices is shown in Figure 3. The impact parameter divided by its error, containing more information, give also better performances. This variable will be used for the b-tagging study presented in this note.

### b-tagging performances at low luminosity

The b-tagging algorithm has been characterized on single b-jets and u-jets coming from WH(100) events (97_6 and 98_2 DICE simulation). The \({\rm E}_{T}\) spectra of these jets covers the range up to \({\rm E}_{T}\ =120\ GeV/c\). The efficiency for b-jets and rejection for u-jets are given in Table 8-1.

The processing time, measured on a Pentium III (500 Hz) running Linux, turned out to be, in average, 4.4 \(ms\) per jet and dominated by the time needed by the track reconstruction. The detail of the elapsed time in the different phases of the algorithm is given in Figure 4.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{c c c c c} \hline  & \({\rm E}_{t}\ >\ 40GeV\) & \(40\ GeV\) & \(<\ {\rm E}_{t}\ <\ 80\ GeV\) & \({\rm E}_{t}\ >\ 120\ GeV\) \\ \hline \(\eta\ <\ 1.5\) & \(4\,3\pm 5\) & \(41\pm 6\) & \(33\pm 9\) \\  & \(21\pm 2\) & \(22\pm 2\) & \(20\pm 4\) \\  & \(7.1\pm 0.4\) & \(12\pm 1\) & \(12\pm 2\) \\ \(\eta\ >\ 1.5\) & \(11\pm 1\) & \(10\pm 1\) & \(11\pm 3\) \\  & \(8.0\pm 0.7\) & \(8.0\pm 0.8\) & \(5.6\pm 1.1\) \\  & \(3.3\pm 0.2\) & \(5.4\pm 0.4\) & \(3.6\pm 0.6\) \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}

Comparison with the Offline

Since no study on \(b\)-tagging at EF is available, the trigger algorithm has been directly compared with the Offline algorithm. A trigger selection corresponding to \(R_{u}=3\) and \(\epsilon_{b}=85\%\) has been applied. For jets selected in this way, the offline selection was then applied and the results are shown in Figure 7. It is found that the full offline performance is only restored for a final b-tagging efficiency \(\epsilon_{b}<70\) %. This demonstrates that the trigger and offline selection are well correlated and that, as far as the LVL2 efficiency is kept above 80%, it is possible to provide offline analyses with an unbiased jet sample in the region \(\epsilon_{b}<70\) %. Different combinations of working points of LVL2 trigger selection and offline analysis could be choosen depending on the speficic physics requirements.

## 5 b-tagging at high luminosity

### Track reconstruction

The quality of the track reconstruction, shown in Figure 6, is considerably degraded with the addition of pile-up. This is essentially due to the pile-up events that ranbonmly distributed along the z-axis.

### Primary vertex reconstruction

The fake fraction can be reduced if the primary vertex is reconstructed.

As previously said, the muon from LVL1 is often unavailable in multi b-jets event, for this reason the primary vertex has been reconstructed computing the baricentre of the \(z_{0}\) parameter of all the tracks in the RoI.

The steps of the procedure are the following:

* the interval \([-15,15]cm\) on z-axis is divided in intervals of \(0.5cm\) and the number of tracks having \(z_{0}\) laying in each interval are counted,
* the three adjacent cells contain the higher number of tracks are selected, and the z coordinate of the primary vertex is computed as a weighted average of the \(z_{0}\) of those tracks : \[z_{\rm{\it{\it{\it{\it{\it{\it{\it{\it{\it{\it{\it{\it{\it{\it{\it{ \it{\it{\it{\it{\it{ \it{    }}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}\] (1)
* two sample of events are identified:
* bad sample: the number of tracks contained in the selected cells is lower than 40% of the total number of tracks or the total number of tracks is lower than 5,
* good sample: the rest of the events. The primary vertex resolution for the two sample is shown in Figure 7. The bad quality sample accounts for about 45% of the total of the events. Given the poor resolution on the primary vertex in the bad quality sample the \(z\) information has been used only for the good quality sample.
The 45% fraction of bad quality RoIs is not really limiting the performances, the reason is that, since we are interesting in multi-jet events, we can computed the z-coordinate of the vertex for the RoI that fulfill the requirement and then pass this information to the other RoIs. The number of events not having the information on z will be \((0.45)^{n}\) where n is the number of RoI in the event.

Alternatively one can also try to calculate the primary vertex using all the tracks in the event.

### b-tagging performances at high luminosity

Figure 9 shows the performances of the b-tagging at high luminosity for all the events without the \(z\) information and the for the events having \(z\) information (good quality sample). It can be seen that when the primary vertex is reconstructed the low luminosity performances are recovered.

The average processing \((96\:ms)\) is considerably higher than in the low luminosity case.

This result could be probably improved by a dedicated study (tuned on the high luminosity case) on the optimal RoI size and on the prelimary cuts that could be used to reduce the number of combination of space points tested.

## 6 Impact of b-tagging on physics channels

Final states containing four \(b\)-jets have been proposed as signatures with a substantial discovery potential for heavy Higgs (\(b\overline{b}H\), \(b\overline{b}A\) with \(H/A\to b\overline{b}\) or \(H\to hh\to b\overline{b}b\overline{b}\)) [4]. The main drawback of these channels is the enormous background from QCD multijet production and the low rate; in order to maintain a reasonable LV L1 trigger rate from jets, rather high ET thresholds have been set on the individual jets. With the present LV L1 menu for three and four-jets ([3j75,4j55] at low luminosity and [3j90,4j90] at high luminosity) these channels are selected with modest efficiency. The ET thresholds can be lowered if it is combined (or replaced) with a b-tagging selection.

### Study of \(H\to hh\to b\overline{b}b\overline{b}\) at low luminosity

The impact of a LV L2 \(b\)-jet trigger on the current LV L1 trigger menu at low luminosity has been studied for the channel with \(m(H)=~{}300~{}GeV\), since this is the case where the largest potential improvement could be obtained. The LV L1 jet E\({}_{T}\) thresholds have been lowered to 4b35 and 3b40 and then a soft \(b\)-tagging selection has been applied on multi-jet events that would not have been selected by the "standard" LV L1 menu (in order to minimize the impact on physics channels of interest without \(b\)-jet). The results (for a particular set of LVL1 rates) are summarised in Table 8-9 (the LVL2 jet-trigger has not been applied). It can be seen that the rejection factors of LVL2_btag1 and LVL2_btag2 (about 6 and 12 respectively) do not really correspond to the third and fourth power of the rejection for single jet due to the presence of gluon radiation and \(b\),\(c\) quark in the samples.

The results presented show how much the acceptance for this particular channel could be enhanced keeping the constraint that the offline sample remains unbiased for \(\epsilon_{b}\) up to 70%. The price to pay is a significant increase in the LVL1 rate; this could obviously be reduced if a lower increase in efficiency were sufficient. The final tuning of this trigger component will be a trade-off between the maximum acceptable LVL1 rate and the relevance of this physics channel based on its discovery potential.

## 7 Conclusions and future work

The present b-jets tagging performances are essentially limited by the \(d_{0}\) resolution and by the level of fake associations; improvement and refinement of the \(d_{0}\) reconstruction can come from studies of the clustering algorithm in the pixel detector, while the optimization of the fraction of fake tracks involve some further tuning of the algorithm. The studies of the impact of b-tagging selection has to be widen to new physics channels and extended to the high luminosity case. Finally beam-position stability and effect of the misalignment should be considered.
