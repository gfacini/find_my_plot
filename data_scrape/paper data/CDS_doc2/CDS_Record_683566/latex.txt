The setup of the two movable muon walls during the module 0 beam test in 1996 is described. The walls can be positioned to detect the leakage from the module 0 during the beam test scans. The basic data consistency check is performed and muon wall data in the standard ntuples are described.

## 1 Introduction

Forthe August - September 1996 beam test of Tilecal module 0, two movable muon walls were installed - a back one and a side one (see Fig. 1). The back wall slides parallel to the module 0 girder and the side one slidesperpendicular to it. The back wall can be positioned beyond the scanning table surface.

The back muon wall, see Fig. 2, is composed of 2 rows of 5 pieces of scintillator, the so called Prague paddles [1] (active area \(96\times 80\) cm\({}^{2}\)), and of 5 Michigan State scintillator pairs [2] (active area \(92\times 102\) cm\({}^{2}\)) used in the April 1996 combined beam test as MidSamplers. Each of the Michigan State scintillators is read via optical fibers from both the top and bottom directions to two photomultipliers. The back muon wall has thus 20 counters, both types of detectors together span an active area 185 cm wide. The side muon wall (see Fig. 3) consists of 5 Prague paddles (active area \(96\times 40\) cm\({}^{2}\)).

The muon walls and the data acquisition labels are summarised in Table 1. The typical response of these scintillators to the muon beam is presented in Section 3. The last section describes the muon wall data in the standard ntuples.

## 2 Muon wall positions

Both muon walls slide in rails and can be repositioned as the table is moved to correspond to a pseudorapidity range from \(-1.0\) to \(0.2\). The back muon wall can cover pseudorapidities from \(-0.65\) to \(0.2\), whereas the side muon wall covers \(-1.0\) to \(-0.65\). Each wall can be fixed in one of several equally spaced positions.

The back wall is labelled on both sliding rails with numbers \(-0.5\), \(-0.4\), \(-0.3\), \(-0.2\), \(-0.1\) and \(0.0\). One leg of the support frame is marked with red triangles that are positioned against the tick marks on the rail. The position is fixed to the table floor by means of the plug with red handle at the bottom of the frame. The wall is perpendicular to the table surface; i.e. the angle between the wall normal and module 0 axis is \(\approx 8.4\) deg (see Fig. 1).

The side wall has tick marks on its lower part with numbers \(-0.86\), \(-0.81\), \(-0.76\), \(-0.72\) and \(-0.68\). The yellow triangles of a handle can be positioned against the tick marks and the position fixed with a screw with a red handle and a nut.

The counter geometry is shown in the Figs. 1,2. The back muon wall is drawn in the position 0.0 as seen by the test beam at \(\eta=0.0\), whereas the side wall in the position \(-0.68\) as seen by the beam at \(\theta=-90\) deg.

The correspondence between several ATLAS detector pseudorapidities and the positions of the muon walls is shown in Table 2. The position numbers correspond approximately to \(\eta\) values the the center of the walls.

During the scan at \(\theta=-90\) degrees, the side muon wall is supposed to be at the position \(-0.86\).

Tabs. 3 and 4 give more information on the positions for both walls. Table 3 shows the three values of pseudorapidities corresponding to the the edges (\(\eta_{max}\) and \(\eta_{min}\)) and center (\(\eta_{centre}\)) of the back wall. Three similarly defined lengths (\(z_{min}\), \(z_{centre}\) and \(z_{max}\)) measured perpendicularly from the axis of module 0 (test beam at \(\eta=0.0\)) to the edges and center of the back wall also given in the Table 3. The sign is same as for pseudorapidities. The back wall is treated as one wall of width 185 cm.

Similarly, Table 4 shows for each position of the side wall the three values of pseudorapidity and the relative radius _rr_, the perpendicular distance from the front plane of module 0 (i.e. from TILECAL minimum radius value \(R_{min}=2283\) mm).

## 3 Tests of the scintillating counters with muon beams

The response of the muon wall scintillation counters to charged particles was tested using muon beams. Fig. 4 illustrates the response of two 'Prague' and two 'Mi chigan State' counters of the back muon wall. the Michigan State and Prague Energy losses in the scintillator corresponds to the Landau theory and were fitted by the Moyal function.

A slight dependence of the peak of the muon response on the distance of the muon beam from the light guide edge, 0.88 % per cm, was measured for Prague counters.

Peak positions for all counters of both muon walls are summarised in the Table 5. A correction for the position the muon beam was applied for the few runs where muons hit the scintillator very close to the light guide edge.

These values are used for the standard ntuple production in the following manner : We define that the counter was hit by at least one charged particle if the signal obeys the relation

\[AD\,C>0.7\times\mbox{Peak\_position} \tag{1}\]

The number of counters with charged particle hits is given for the back and side muon walls separately. The sum of the normalised signals from all

**counters** is also calculated for the back and side muon walls separately using the formulae

\[MuBackSum = \sum_{i=1}^{20}MuBack(i)/\mbox{\tt Peak\_position}(i) \tag{2}\] \[MuSideSum = \sum_{i=1}^{5}MuSide(i)/\mbox{\tt Peak\_position}(i) \tag{3}\]

## 4 Muon wall data in the standard NTUPLEs

(/afs/cern.ch/user/t/tilebeam/module0/run/Tical\_Ofmon)

The Muwall information in the standard N-tuple has following structure:

* MuBackSum contains the normalised sum of the 20 counters of the back muon wall.
* MuBackHit is the number of counters detecting at least one charged particle (m.i.p.) in the back muon wall.
* MuSideSum and MuSideHit are equivalent values for the side muon wall.
* The muon walls are described by 4 words and two vectors MuBack(20) and MuSide(5). The vectors contain ADC output for each counter (the vector sequence numbers correspond to the logical numbers shown in the Figs. 1,2).

For the Prague scintillators the values given are NON-AMPLIFIED ADC counts, for Michigan State scintillators the values are AMPLIFIED ADC counts.

## 5 Summary

The muon wall scintillation counters and their correspondence to the DAQ system is described for the August - September 96 module 0 beam test period in Table 1.

The suitable positions of the movable muon walls for the beam test of the Tilecal module 0 are given in Tabs. 3,4.

The Landau behaviour of the response of muon wall counters to the muon beam has been measured and the Moyal fit results to the ADC spectra are listed in Table 5.

The muon walls information in the standard ntuples is explained in Section 4.
