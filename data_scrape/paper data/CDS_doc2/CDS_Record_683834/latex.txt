###### Abstract

New SCT forward hybrids have been completed in Freiburg. Their performance, based on readout tests using batches of ABCD chips is presented in this note. A so called Kapton hybrid (K1) was equipped with 6 n-type ABCD-2 chips and a 6 cm n-in-n forward detector. A subset of the 768 strips were ganged together to simulate 12 cm long strips. After careful grounding no oscillations were observed. The noise values measured are about 0.3 fC (1900 electrons) for 12 cm strips, 0.18 fC (1200 electrons) for 6 cm strips and below 0.09 fC (550 electrons) for unbonded channels.

Introduction

Two new SCT forward hybrid prototypes have been completed and subjected to thorough tests in Freiburg:

1. ceramic Al\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{3}\) hybrid based on Liverpool schematic and layout [1]
2. and a kapton hybrid (K1) based on the Oslo schematic [2]

To evaluate the electrical characteristics of the hybrids a set of readout scans for the front end chips must be performed and the results analysed. This note presents the readout test setup in Freiburg, methods and results obtained especially of the Kapton Freiburg hybrid K1 populated with ABCD-2 chips in view of oscillation problems seen with other hybrids.

## 2 Methods and equipment

The quality of a hybrid equipped with ASICS and bonded to detectors can be evaluated via measurements of several important parameters: threshold, gain, offset and noise for each channel, their uniformity over the chip, response linearity, etc.

To get all these characteristics for various hybrid-chip combinations a standard set of measurements was performed:

1. readout scan
2. strobe delay scan
3. FE Bias Current scan
4. FE Shaper Current scan
5. set of charge injection scans at optimized above parameters with nominal various settings of FE Bias Current (usually from the range between 156\(\mu\)A and 285\(\mu\)A) and for several threshold settings
6. set of threshold scans at optimized above parameters with nominal various settings of FE Bias Current (usually from the range between 156\(\mu\)A and 285\(\mu\)A) and for several charges injected

All measured data sets were analyzed in this procedure

1. Charge injection scans- 50% point in fC for each channel 3 calculating gain at 1 fC as the first derivation of the response curve at 1 fC 4 further statistical analysis of input noise and gain as a function of FE Bias Current separately for unbonded channels and for 6 and 12 cm bonded strips
* Threshold scans 1. efficiency vs. threshold fitting with complementary error function \[\mathrm{erfc}(x)=1-\mathrm{erf}(x)\] (3) 2. test of channel quality (\(\chi^{2}\leq 10\)) 3. plotting and fitting the response \(V_{r}\) (mean 50% point in mV) vs. injected charge \(Q_{i}\) for each chip, calculating mean gain, output and input noise 4. comparison of response for \(Q_{i}=2.5\) fC and \(Q_{i}=3.5\) fC, evaluating approximate gain \(G\) and offset \(O\) for each channel at 3 fC (assuming linear response in this region) using the formulae \[G=\frac{V_{r2}-V_{r1}}{Q_{i2}-Q_{i1}}\] (4) \[O=V_{r1}-GQ_{i1}\] (5) 3. calculating the quality factor for each chip defined as \[QF=\frac{G}{\sqrt{\sigma_{\mathrm{gain}}^{2}+\sigma_{\mathrm{offset}}^{2}}}\] (6)For the readout tests of the ABCD chips we have a standard setup used in several SCT institutes. The hardware consists of

* PC (Pentium 200MHz, WinNT 4.0, PCI/VXI-Interface)
* supply and driver
* LVDS driver card, new ABC GAL's on SLL card
- self burned with code from T. Fahlands webpage [3]
* Software: ABCDAQ vers. 0.54 by P. Phillips [6]
* Melbourne SC97 Support Card [5]
* pigtail to the hybrid (Freiburg design)
* Hewlett Packard pulse generator to obtain 40 MHz clock frequency

S-curve fitting was performed by Autofit V. 3.0 written by P.W. Phillips[6], by PAW Kumac from Y. Unno and by ABCDView from J. Jakubek from TU Prague [7]. Gain, offset and noise analysis was done in EXCEL and simultaneously with PAW Kumacs from Y. Unno and P.W. Phillips.

## 3 Module description

This section is divided into subsections corresponding to the specific hardware used to construct a test module for the Kapton hybrid K1.

### Butterfly Kapton hybrid K1

The flexible Freiburg Kapton hybrid K1 features 4 copper and polyimide layers, wrapped in the butterfly fashion around a TPG substrate, which itself is carbon encapsulated. This technique exhibits optimum performance regarding thermal conductivity, radiation length and last not least is not toxic. The following table summerizes some important parameters of K1:

\begin{tabular}{|l|c c c|} \hline material & radiation length & thermal conductivity & thickness per layer \\  & in mm & in W/(m K) & or trace in \(\mu\)m \\ \hline adhesive & 335 & 0.42 & 25 \\ copper & 14.3 & 390 & 16 \\ polyimide & 286 & 0.16 & 25 \\ C enc. TPG & 190 & 792 (x, y) & 500 \\  & & 10 (z) & \\ \hline \end{tabular}

The thickness of the hybrid in units of radiation length normalized to the detector area of an outer module (id est: 7911 \(mm^{2}\) ) is \(0.299\%\)\(X_{0}\).

The circuit was manufactured at Dyconex, Switzerland. the substrate is a commercial product from Advanced Ceramics Corp. (USA). The gluing was done with a double sided Scotch tape from 3M.

The top-layer L1 incorporates copper traces 70 \(\mu\)m wide and 16 \(\mu\)m thick. Therefore extreme low resistivity of interconnections is provided in comparison to gold paste. At the location of frontend chips a single meshed AGND area serves as an ideal contact to the metallized backside of thinned and metallized ABCD-2's and as a heat sink as well. Traces are also on layer L2 to facilitate together with L1 cross overs. Layer L3 is divided into two parts: analog ground (AGND) and digital ground (DGND). \(V_{cc}\) and \(V_{dd}\) is supplied via layer L4. Two holes are punched through all layers and the substrate to make final assembly and handling of kapton and substrate easier. The kapton hybrid has the serial number FR-K13.

### ABCD chip set

We have used 6 ABCD-2 readout chips of the n-on-n type, which have been thinned down to 300 \(\mu\)m and back metallized. The following table summarizes the information extracted from the initial tests at CERN:

\begin{tabular}{|l|l l l l l|} \hline position & master 0 & slave 1 & slave 2 & slave 3 & slave 4 & end 5 \\ \hline ID: & w 3-0-08 & w3-5-16 & w 3-2-13 & w3-0-09 & w7-5-17 & w7-4-16 \\ QF: & 2.03 & 2.02 & 2.04 & 2.22 & 1.689 & 1.69 \\ Gain & 60.21 & 57.89 & 58.47 & 55.96 & 65.40 & 77.04 \\ \hline \end{tabular}

The chips have been glued conductively with Polytec H20 S (silverloaded 2 components) onto AGND pads of the hybrid. The tests have been performed after just 2 chips (M0 and S1) had been attached and in a second step after also S3 - E5 had been hooked up. Following the steps described in chapter 2, equations 4 and 5 we obtained with just 2 chips bonded:

\begin{tabular}{|l r r|} \hline position & master 0 & slave 1 \\ \hline Gain(at 3 fC) & 94.8 & 81.5 \\ \(\sigma_{gain}\) & 5.3 & 3.2 \\ Offset(at 3 fC) & 38.6 & 37.9 \\ \(\sigma_{offset}\) & 28.8 & 20.1 \\ QF (Quality factor) & 3.24 & 4.0 \\ Input noise (fC) & 0.118 & 0.11 \\ \(\sigma_{noise}\) & 0.015 & 0.07 \\ \hline \end{tabular}

FE bias current was set to 257.6 and FE shaper to 20.4 \(\mu\)A. Analog and digital ground were connected and strobe delay set to 27, threshold to 150 mV.

### Pitch adapter

One pair of glass pitch adapters (designed by U. Liverpool) for outer ring forward modules have been used to facilitate connection between FE asics and detector strips.

### Detector

The n-on-n detector was obtained from Hamamatsu Photonics (Japan) and is forseen for the outer forward rings of the SCT. It features a total of 768 fan shaped 5.7 cm long strips. It is of the W32 type and has the serial number SDX 33838-9. A total of 14 strips have an AC short and 2 strips are open.

Figure 1: Layout of the 4 conducting layers.

The detector was glued with Loctite Output 315 onto alumina spines. These are ceramic and therefore not conductive.

### Bonds, bias and connections

Bond connections to the detector have been made in the context of 3 different schemes. Discussed here are scheme II and III, which can be described in the following way:

* Scheme II
* M0 and S1
* channels 0-3 bonded to 12 cm strips length (two 6 cm strips ganged at the rear side)
* rest: alternating 12 cm strip length ( channels 10,12,18,20,26,28,34, 36,46,48,54,56, etc bonded to two 6 cm strips)
* 1. 0 - 3 unbonded
* 2. 4 - 31 bonded to 6 cm strips
* 3. the same pattern periodically continued till end of the chip
* S3 - E5
* 1. 0 - 3 unbonded
* 2. 4 - 31 bonded to 6 cm strips
* 3. 32 - 35 unbonded
* 4. 36 - 62 only even channels bonded to 6 cm to study crosstalk
* Same pattern periodically continued till end of the chip
* Scheme III
* M0, S1 and S2 unchanged
* S3 - E5 rebonding of the alternating 6 cm regions into a 12 cm region by ganging together two not neighbouring strips

The arrangements of the two schemes are shown in figure 3.5.

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:9]

filter scheme with 4 resistors and one capacitor between, but during tests the bias high line towards the detecor had a 0 \(\Omega\) resistor. The following resistor values have been used:

R1: 1K\(\Omega\), R2: 0K\(\Omega\), R3: 5 K\(\Omega\) and R4: 5K\(\Omega\). The capacitor between bias high and low and between had a value of 10 nF. In addition there are 4 capacitors of 10 nF each to AGND in the forward corners of the hybrid. See also schematic in figure 3.5

AGND and DGND are essentially connected, where ever possible. A connection is done on the support card, on the hybrid close to the connector and finally at the position of each readout chip. The TPG substrate was also connected via several bonds to AGND on the hybrid. During tests detector and hybrid are put into a copper box which again is connected to ground lines of the adapter board between readout cable and the small connector for forward modules.

The copper box is cooled via evaporated liquid nitrogen. Temperature is about +8 degree Celcius in the input pipe.

## 4 Measurements and results

In total the test setup (scheme III) exhibits 146 strips with 12 cm length, 280 with 6 cm length and the rest of the channels (342)are not bonded to detector strips.

All results presented in this section have been obtained from the charge injection scans.

Most of the results is shown in a graphical form at the figures attached. Short comments to these figures follow:

* Fig.2 shows the noise of each channel for each FEB Current measured in mV (1 mV = 0.1 fC). The intention of this plot is to show that the noise of almost all channels stays reasonable at each of the FEB Currents scanned.
* Fig.3 shows the same as the previous figure for bonding scheme III. Here scans at 4 FEB Currents have been taken only. Slight noise decrease of the 12 cm region at the last 3 chips can be observed.
* Figs. 4 and 5 show the histograms of the noise (scheme III) for FEB Current setting of 248 \(\mu\)A for each chip. One can clearly see the noise decrease from chip S3 to E5 for 12 cm regions conversely to the increase of the noise for the unbonded channels at the same chips.
* Fig. 6 displays the input noise mean value vs. FE Bias Current.
* some chips show lower gain when bonded to 12 cm strips.
* repeated scans and analysis showed gain fluctuations of about 20. However, the general trend was always clearly visible

Using the scheme III a Qinj-Scan with Vth=300mV, FES: 18 \(\mu\)A, SD=11 and a detector bias of -150 Volts gave the following noise values and sigmas (strip length 0 cm denotes unbonded channels):

\begin{tabular}{|r r r r|} \hline chip & strip length & noise & st. dev. \\ location & cm & electrons & electrons \\ \hline M0 & 0 & 508 & 138 \\  & 12 & 2062 & 199 \\ S1 & 0 & 495 & 149 \\  & 12 & 1976 & 111 \\ S2 & 0 & 427 & 140 \\  & 6 & 1249 & 168 \\ S3 & 0 & 545 & 89 \\  & 6 & 1181 & 92 \\  & 12 & 2004 & 224 \\ S4 & 0 & 606 & 164 \\  & 6 & 1241 & 114 \\  & 12 & 1944 & 251 \\ E5 & 0 & 614 & 164 \\  & 6 & 1169 & 248 \\  & 12 & 1861 & 128 \\ \hline \end{tabular} For more detailed or newer results Freiburg ATLAS Web page can be visited [11]

## 5 Conclusions

Based upon the results presented above several conclusions can be drawn:

* Noise is also almost constant over the whole FE Bias Current region scanned
* No increase of noise observed in unbonded channels neighbouring bonded strips
* Gain depends on the FE Bias current setting. The gain extrapolated to 1 fC injected charge is always between 100 and 140 mV/fC for the FE Bias current above 200 \(\mu\)A.
* There is no systematic difference of the gain between the bonded and unbonded channels.
* Both from the noise values obtained from charge injection scans and from the noise scan curves one can conclude, that _no oscillations have been observed for presented system of 6 n-type chips bonded to 6 cm and ganged 12 cm strips_ even in the high gain region.
