In this note we describe the possible choice of the working point for different options of muon tracker ( HSC,HPDT,JCC ) and discuss quantitatively the general limitation, which are dictated by:

- nonuniformity of the toroidal B

- occupancy ( or maximum drift time ) consideration,

- geometry ( or drift field distribution ) for different technologies.

LORENTZ ANGLE.

The drift of electrons in gas in presence of B - field ( BLE ) gives rise the Lorentz angle \(\theta_{\_}\) between the direction of the drift and E - field:

tan \(\theta_{\_}\) = \(\omega\) < \(\tau\) > ( 1 ) where \(\omega\) = \(\frac{\mbox{e}\,\mbox{B}}{\mbox{m}}\) is cyclotron frequency, and < \(\tau\) > is average time between electron collisions.

and therefore drift time of electrons depends on B - field. The nonuniformity of B - field in case of ATLAS toroid within azimuthal coverage ( n/2 ) of the one drift chamber ( along the anode wire) is large, especially for middle muon station (~ 0.5 - 1.0 T1 ). Therefore due to different space - drift time relations of drifting electrons in case of different B - field for the same anode wires some systematic error \(\delta\) is created ( fig.1 ) which is increased drastically with increase of Lorentz angle \(\theta_{\_}\). The data on fig.1 was calculated using MAGBOLTZ programme [1] for different gas mixtures in the case of cylindrical drift chamber with diameter 2.0 cm. As one can be seen from Fig.1 the systematic error \(\delta\) depends on \(\theta_{\_}\) ( for B = 0.9 T1 ) only for different gas mixtures. In order to decrease \(\delta\) at the level at list less than 100 \(\mu\)m we need \(\theta_{\_}\) < 10\({}^{\mbox{o}}\). Otherwise the special azimuthal dependent calibrations space - drift time procedure along each wire is needed.

The detail study of different gases showed that small Lorentz angle ( \(\theta_{\_}\) < 10\({}^{\mbox{o}}\) for B = 1.0 T1 ) can be realized only for gases with high electron cross sections ( and small < \(\tau\) > in ( 1 )), such as CO2, DME or N2 ( cooling gases ). This is especially valid
