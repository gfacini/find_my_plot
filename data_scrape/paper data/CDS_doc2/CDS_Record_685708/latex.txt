**As a cost savings measure the ATLAS Forward Calorimeter (FCal) working group was asked to consider a re-design, making the FCal, particularly the expensive tungsten hadronic sections, smaller. At the same time the FCal and HEC communities were recognizing that the transition near \(\eta\) = 3.1 was not as clean as originally envisioned. These pressures led to reconsideration of the transition and a proposed, new configuration which saves approximately the 0.5 MCHF requested by the Global Descoping Task Force.**

**Introduction**

**Is the transition between the ATLAS Forward Calorimeter (FCal) and the Hadronic End-cap Calorimeter (HEC) chosen optimally? The baseline design was set by considerations of best performance and lowest backgrounds in the muon system. Are there acceptable compromises which would yield cost savings? These are questions raised by the ATLAS Global Descoping Task Force in its report of November 1995. The tungsten absorber in the hadronic FCal modules is quite expensive so schemes to reduce the module size were encouraged.**

**In the baseline design the transition has several uninstrumented volumes which are larger than seems optimal. These are due to incommensurability in the depth segmentation of the FCal and of the HEC. It was originally thought that the FCal and HEC could be nestled neatly together leaving only minimal dead volume for structural members. But more detailed analysis showed that it was difficult to match the depth segmentation in the two systems and this left the gaps which show up in the lower half of Figure 1. The HEC and FCal working groups agreed to investigate alternate transition geometries.**

**This report describes an alternate geometry for the FCal/HEC transition and outlines the progress with Monte Carlo studies of the performance compared to the baseline design. A first estimate of the cost savings is also presented. The FCal Working Group recommends adoption of this new geometry to the ATLAS LARG.**

#### The Baseline FCal/HEC Transition

The transition between the FCal and the HEC is roughly along a line through the interaction point (IP), i.e. the transition is at constant \(\eta\). We call this a conical transition although it is actually a series of cylindrical shapes with increasing radius as the distance from the IP increases. This fictitious line along the transition is at a value of \(|\eta|\) slightly less than the edge of the Endcap Electromagnetic (EM) Calorimeter so that the transition is _hidden_ behind the EM calorimeter as viewed from the IP. To keep the size of the FCal small it was decided in the summer of '95 to increase the inner edge of the Endcap EM calorimeter to an \(|\eta|\) of 3.2 (from 3.0).

This (baseline) transition was set by several constraints. No part of the HEC should be directly visible from the IP. The HEC should always be hidden behind the EM calorimeter. The HEC alone is not thick enough to prevent significant shower leakage out the back into the muon system. The HEC is not designed for EM showers and its hadronic response would be compromised by the pileup from \(\pi^{0}\)'s. The positive ion buildup due to EM showers could also compromise the HEC performance. We were also attempting to minimize the hadronic shower leakage from the FCal into the HEC in order to control pileup.

Figure 1: The lower half shows the _conical_ transition which is the present baseline design. The upper half shows the proposed _cylindrical_ transition.

### The Proposed Changes

At the November 1995 FCal Working Group Meeting it was agreed to study a _cylindrical_ geometry where the three FCal modules all have the same outer radius. The transition between the FCal EM module and the HEC would still be in the shadow of the EM Endcap Calorimeter but the transitions between the FCal HAD1 and HAD2 modules and the HEC would not be. Instead they might be sufficiently shadowed by the FCal EM module to avoid problems. Further it was agreed to try to move the whole FCal upstream by about 200 mm relative to the HEC. These two changes would allow the FCal HAD2 module to be decreased in size substantially, the FCal HAD1 module to be decreased by a smaller amount, and the FCal EM module would stay at about the same size. In order to accommodate these changes the HEC would require a larger bore at the front end and a smaller bore at the rear end, a net increase in the volume of the HEC.

This geometry is shown in the top half of Figure 1. Figure 2 shows the baseline version of the HEC modules while Figure 3 indicates the required changes in the HEC volume.

The outer radius of the FCal was a variable to be determined by detailed performance simulations and cost estimates.

Several concerns were listed to guide the simulations. 1) While the FCal/HEC transition in the new geometry is hidden behind the Endcap EM Calorimeter at the upstream end, the fact that it comes out of the shadow at larger \(|z|\) could mean that the thickness of the calorimeter in this region becomes insufficient for our various needs. 2) The necessary small gap between the FCal and HEC could conceivably act as a channel for neutrons to stream out towards the forward muon system. 3) It wasn't clear what the effect on the jet performance would be.

### Calorimeter Depth

GEANTino scans of the various calorimeter geometries allow for comparisons of hermeticity and coverage. Such scans take rays from the IP at various values of \(\eta\) and sum the material along that ray in units of hadronic interaction lengths, \(\lambda\). (There is some ambiguity in which definition of interaction length is the appropriate choice. Here we use the default GEANT interaction length which is slightly different from the Particle Data Book values.) Such plots of thickness in \(\lambda\) versus \(\eta\) are very useful but have their limitations. For instance it is sometimes impossible to see thin spots which are not exactly lined up along an \(\eta\) ray. The gap between the FCal and HEC in the cylindrical geometry is an example. Another example comes when one calorimeter element is displaced in radius with respect to another. The far forward calorimeter in CMS is an example. Without heavy shielding the region between the endcap calorimeter and the far forward calorimeter is a source of backgrounds in the muon system. But this would not show up at all in a GEANTino scan.

Figure 4 shows GEANTino plots for four geometries where only active calorimeter material is included. The first surprise was that the baseline design shows a deep hole in coveragenear \(|\mathbf{\eta}|=3.1\). This is due to the pseudoprojective crack (i.e. the worst case ray crosses the transition three times) and due to uncomfortably large holes between the FCal and HEC from the incommensurability in longitudinal segmentation pointed out earlier. Over the range of the \(|\mathbf{\eta}|\) values, the \(|\mathbf{\eta}|\) values are not well defined.

a narrow \(\eta\) region the scan shows less than 6 interaction lengths in active coverage.

Figure 4 also shows three cylindrical geometries. The first to be studied was the one labelled \(r=420\) mm. This shows an uncomfortably wide hole in coverage near \(|\eta|=3.2\) dipping as low as 7 interaction lengths of active calorimeter. The geometry labelled \(r=465\) mm shows an acceptable dip. In fact larger radii do not show significant improvement. So we searched for the radius at which the dip began to worsen markedly. This is close to the one labelled \(r=450\) mm. We chose this geometry for further study. Figure 5 shows a larger number of cylindrical geometries, differing in radius, clearly demonstrating this

optimization.

### Hadron Response

Charged pions from the IP of energies 100, 200, and 300 GeV were directed at the transition region and the energy deposited in the active calorimeter, as determined by GHEISHA showers within a mixture level GEANT description, was determined. Figure 6 shows the deposited energy, normalized to the incident pion energy, for three different geometries,

Note the rapid decrease in thickness of the calorimeter at the worst place as the cylinder radius falls below 450 mm.

the baseline cone geometry, a cylinder at 465 mm, and the proposed cylinder at 450 mm.

The plots show better response to pions for the cylindrical geometries than for the baseline cone geometry. However the difference is largely hidden by the effect of the cryostat walls upstream of the FCal, a region which is the same for all geometries. The response in the region near \(|\eta|=3.5\) is unacceptable and highlights the need to refine the design of the endcap cryostat. (It is interesting that a very early engineering design of the ATLAS endcap calorimeter by Lyle Mason, formerly of Martin-Marietta and lead engineer for the GEM liquid argon subsystem, included cryostat walls which gave satisfactory response to hadrons in this region.) Figure 7 is a GEANTino scan where the order of the materials encountered by a ray are displayed. Up to 2 interaction lengths of material can be seen in

front of the FCal near \(|\eta|\)=3.5.

### Backgrounds in the Muon System and Tracker

The proposed geometry has several features which must be tested to ensure we are not increasing the background in the muon system nor in the inner tracker. The straight, narrow channel between the FCal and HEC could act as a chimney through which neutrons could channel. While this chimney does not lie along an \(\eta\) ray (and hence does not show up very well in the GEANTino scans) the angle of this chimney to such rays is not very large so relatively high energy hadrons could conceivably channel significant distances down it. This is in contrast to the channel between the FCal and HEC in the baseline conical geometry. There the channel zig-zags somewhat although it is more projective.

In the proposed geometry the tungsten shield plug behind the FCal is replaced by a copper plug which is deeper and hence has almost the same interaction lengths as the plug

in the baseline. Nevertheless we must make sure the thickness is still sufficient to keep backgrounds in the muon system to acceptable levels.

Various changes have narrowed the argon volume behind the HEC. Now the space is more fully filled by the copper absorber (which is likely moved from a position just behind the HEC to one where it is mounted on the cold, end flange as indicated in Figure 1). This argon volume can act as another chimney for neutrons to channel into the muon system, this time into the barrel region. The reduction of this argon volume should diminish this problem.

Comparison of Figures 8 and 9 shows that the neutron albedo in the tracker region has barely changed due to the new geometry. (It is interesting to note that at small distances from the beam the dominant source of radiation damage to the silicon tracker is due to hadrons from the IP, not neutron albedo.) An increase of 10 to 20% is seen in places. These differences can be seen more quantitatively in Figure 12. Adding a bit more polyethylene seems to reduce the albedo neutrons slightly as seen in Figure 14. The reduction is more dramatic at smaller R but not particularly relevant. Removal of the FCal entirely (for study purposes only) only reduces the neutron albedo by 10 to 20%. So the FCal is not the dominant source of neutrons in the inner tracker. We believe the small change

### Recommendation of the FCal Working Group

The FCal Working Group recommends the new, cylindrical geometry with an outer active FCal radius of 450 mm.

The cylindrical geometry has a cleaner FCal/HEC interface which will make construction easier. The expensive FCal HAD modules are smaller which leads to a cost savings (see next section). Results from the performance and background studies have led to the 450 mm outer radius for the FCal. Details of this region for the proposed, new geometry are shown in Figure 15. Recent changes in the endcap cryostat and elsewhere have not entirely settled down so we are a little uncertain about the distance from the IP to the critical points in the calorimeter. We believe that this radius of 450 mm is relatively insensitive to these small uncertainties in distance to the IP but reserve the right to re-examine this when the numbers are better known.

The fact that the FCal has moved forward by about 200 mm means that the high \(|\eta|\) edge of the FCal has decreased by about 0.04 from 4.92 to 4.88. We believe that the performance penalty is acceptable but we will Monte Carlo this soon.

This geometry is quite new and we have not had a chance to consider all of the conse

of the FCal modules.

The new preamp channel count works out so that we require slightly less than 96 64-pin connectors in the feedthroughs per end leaving a few spares for monitoring, etc. This is an improvement over the baseline which required slightly more than this number of connectors leading to inefficiencies in the allocation of feedthrough pins.

### Estimates of the Cost Savings

The costing of the FCal is a dynamic process. From improved understanding of the details follows more accurate cost estimates. So the cost estimate changes with time. In order to separate effects due to improved estimates from those due to the proposed change in geometry we here provide an estimate of the incremental cost savings due only to the change in geometry.

FCal cost items fall into three categories, those which do not scale with size such as tooling, those which scale with the volume of each module such as tungsten, and those which scale with the DAQ channel count such as the warm front ends. We will ignore the first category since it won't contribute to the incremental cost savings.

As can be estimated from Figure 1, the EM module volume increases by 3% in going from the baseline to the proposed cylindrical geometry, the HAD1 decreases by 14%, and the HAD2 decreases by 28%. Per unit volume the EM module is relatively inexpensive

Figure 13: **Neutron flux (\(\rm{KHz/cm^{2}}\)) for kinetic energies above 100 keV at the location of the first forward muon superlayer versus R in cm (where R is the distance from the beam line). A slight increase in the neutron flux can be seen for the proposed cylindrical geometry.**

compared to the HAD modules. This leads to incremental costs of +3 kCHF for the EM, \(-141\) kCHF for HAD1, and \(-325\) kCHF for HAD2 where a positive number means that the proposed geometry is more expensive than the baseline and a negative means it's less expensive. The total savings in the mechanical costs is estimated to be 463 kCHF and this number is entered in Table I.

For the electronics preamps, motherboards, cold to warm cables, and the calibration system all scale with the module size. But the scaling is different from the mechanical scaling since there are fewer preamps per unit volume of HAD module than of EM module. The preamp count goes from 6565 per end to 5908 per end, a change of 10%. This leads to a cost savings of 65 kCHF. The DAQ channels after the summing circuits scale in yet another way. Here the change is 3% and the cost savings is 8 kCHF giving a total electronics cost savings for the FCal of 73 kCHF. This is also entered in the table.

The total of the mechanics and electronics cost savings for the FCal is 536 kCHF and is displayed in Table I.

But the HEC will _increase_ in cost due to the larger volume it must now cover if the proposed

Figure 14: Neutron flux (KHz/cm\({}^{2}\)) for kinetic energies above 100 keV versus z (cm) in the inner tracker region averaged over the range \(40<r<55\) cm, all for the proposed cylindrical geometry. The curve with the highest flux (in general) is the proposed new geometry. At about the same flux is the same geometry but with 30 cm of polyethylene in front of the FCal rather than the standard 20 cm. For \(15<r<30\) cm (not shown) the additional polyethylene helps noticeably. The lowest curve shows the effects of removing the FCal modules entirely. The polyethylene, cryostat walls, and the shielding plug are as in the proposed cylindrical geometry however. Removing the FCal modules entirely reduces the flux by 10 to 20% indicating that the dominant source is not the FCal.

geometry is adopted. Figure 3 shows this volume change. Chris Oram has helped us with the cost estimate for the mechanics and Horst Oberlack has helped with the electronics. These are shown in Table I.

While the shielding plug behind the FCal is not a part of the LARG responsibility, we nevertheless report the savings due to its redesign. We believe that its original cost was overestimated at 60 CHF/kg. Our estimate is closer to 30 CHF/kg and we will use this number which is more conservative when considering the incremental cost savings. Because the FCal has been moved closer to the IP by about 200 mm, more space is opened up behind the FCal. Keeping the same number of interaction lengths in that location we can change from tungsten to copper now and effect a substantial cost savings. The Technical

Proposal had the mass of this plug at 4.4 tonnes (assuming a density of 17 g/cc). At 60 CHF/kg the cost of both plugs is 524 kCHF. Using our estimate of 30 CHF/kg for a cruder tungsten plug we estimate the cost to be 262 kCHF. The new geometry allows a deeper plug but constructed of copper with a mass of 2.8 tonnes. Assuming a finished copper cost of 7 CHF/kg gives a cost of 40 kCHF for both plugs or a savings of 222 kCHF using our conservative tungsten plug cost.

With the reduction in the number of preamp channels in the FCal the feedthrough requirements are relaxed. We will assume that each endcap cryostat will still have 28 feedthroughs but that the number of pins might be reduced to match only those required. The feedthrough pin cost we will use is 13 CHF. This gives a savings of 17 kCHF. On the other hand the number of channels in the HEC increases in the proposed geometry, but by a smaller number because the HEC gangs in the cold. We take the ratio to be 8. So the feedthrough pin cost increase for the HEC is about 2 kCHF.

The aluminum support tube holding the FCal modules is simpler and somewhat smaller in the proposed geometry. The tube is a part of the cryostat and we do not have a cost for it yet. But we roughly guess that the incremental cost savings is less than but of order 10 kCHF.

The total cost savings, taking the tube savings to be at the roughly estimated limit, is about 651 kCHF. This is comfortably in excess of the amount requested of us by the Global Descoping Task Force.
