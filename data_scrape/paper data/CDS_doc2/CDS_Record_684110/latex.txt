###### Abstract

Results of systematic studies of the potential problem related to wire vibrations in the TRT detector are presented. The main goal was to compare the wire vibration amplitudes derived from calculations with test-beam measurements. Test results obtained with a TRT engineering wheel prototype connected to the gas cooling system are presented.

## 1 Introduction

The Transition Radiation Tracker (TRT) is a wire-chamber detector containing about 420,000 elements. This detector is planned to be operated in a confined volume and in a very hostile radiation environment. The energies which will be dissipated by the electronics and the straws (due to the ionisation current) are about 17 kW and 5 kW respectively. This heat has to be removed and this is supposed to be done using cooling systems based on a fluorinate liquid for the electronics and a combination of a ventilating gas and a liquid for the straws (see [8-1]). These two systems are probably the major sources of vibration, which might create some problems for the detector performance. Even though the vibration amplitudes of the mechanical structures are probably quite small from the mechanical point of view, there is a potential problem for the wire which could be excited into a resonance mode, leading to large amplitudes of vibration and possibly degradation of the drift-time accuracy of the TRT. This note describes initial work performed to develop instruments for systematic studies of the wire-vibration issues in the TRT.

## 2 Electrical consequences of wire vibration in a straw tube

Once the wire is installed in the straw, no visual method to measure the wire vibration can be applied. But two other methods can still be used: one of them is the direct measurement method with the help of particle beams (X-ray or test-beam) and the other one is an indirect method based on measurements of the straw capacitance variations during vibration of the wire. This method is rather simple and can be usedalmost under any conditions. In particular, it should be noted that this method can be applied to objects of any size when the test-beam method cannot be used at all. The only instrument needed for these measurements is a calibrated charge-sensitive amplifier. In a first step, the test-beam method should be used to calibrate the capacitance variation method, which gives an upper limit on the wire-vibration amplitude.

Wire vibration means deviation of the wire from its nominal position, which leads to a change of the straw capacitance and hence to a change of the straw charge (for a constant voltage applied to the straw). This can be registered by means of a charge-sensitive amplifier. This method is used for wire-tension measurements during module and wheel assembly in all TRT sites. If the anode wire of diameter **a** in the straw of diameter **b** has an offset **R** as shown in Figure 2-1, then the straw capacitance can be expressed as [8-2]:

\[\mathrm{C}\;=\;\frac{2\pi\epsilon_{0}}{\ln\left(\mathrm{A}+\sqrt{\mathrm{A}^{2 }-1}\right)}\,, \tag{1}\]

where **A** is:

\[\mathrm{A}\;=\;\frac{\mathrm{b}^{2}+\mathrm{a}^{2}-\mathrm{R}^{2}}{2\mathrm{ab}}\]

In first approximation, for **R**\(<<\)**b**:

\[\mathrm{C}\;=\;\frac{2\pi\epsilon_{0}}{\ln\mathrm{b}/\mathrm{a}-\mathrm{R}^{2 }/\mathrm{b}^{2}}\approx\frac{2\pi\epsilon_{0}}{\ln\mathrm{b}/\mathrm{a}} \Bigg{(}1+\frac{\mathrm{R}^{2}}{\mathrm{b}^{2}\ln\mathrm{b}/\mathrm{a}} \Bigg{)}\]

If the wire position varies from **R\({}_{\mbox{max}}\)** to **R\({}_{\mbox{min}}\)**, then the capacitance varies by:

\[\frac{\delta\mathrm{C}}{\mathrm{C}_{0}}\;=\;\frac{\left(\mathrm{R}_{\mathrm{ max}}^{2}-\mathrm{R}_{\mathrm{min}}^{2}\right)}{\mathrm{b}^{2}\ln\mathrm{b}/ \mathrm{a}} \tag{2}\]

Where \(\mathrm{C}_{0}\) is a straw capacitance with central wire position. This formula is a very good approximation and is accurate to a few % for **R**\(<<\)**b**.

Table 1 shows the relative capacitance variation for different values of **R\({}_{\mbox{max}}\)** and **R\({}_{\mbox{min}}\)**.

One can see that, for the same difference **R\({}_{\mbox{max}}\)**-**R\({}_{\mbox{min}}\)**, the capacitance variations are much larger if the wire has an initial offset. The smallest expected capacitance vari

ations occur for the cases where the wire is positioned exactly at the straw centre. It should also be pointed out that the capacitance variation for a 100 \(\upmu\)m deviation from the centre is really very small, \(\sim\)3\(\cdot\)10\({}^{-3}\) pF for a 50 cm long straw, and a rather high voltage should therefore be applied to obtain a measurable signal at the input of the charge-sensitive amplifier.

## 3 Wire-vibration modes

The observed signal from wire vibration in the charge-sensitive amplifier is different for different wire offsets and vibration modes. Figure 3-2 shows possible modes of wire vibration and the signals observed at the amplifier output. The top part of this figure shows the case of minimum sensitivity of the method. In this case, the output signal manifests a dual wire-vibration frequency. The maximum sensitivity of this method is reached for the case shown in the middle part of Figure 3-2. Even small wire vibrations lead to a signal of large amplitude with a frequency corresponding to the wire proper frequency. The bottom part of Figure 3-2 shows the case when the wire vibrates in 3D. If the wire is close to the straw centre and vibrates in 3D (circular vibration labelled 3 in Figure 3-2), one even expects no signal on the amplifier output. In reality, almost all wires have an offset of at least 100 \(\upmu\)m. If the wire has an offset and if the voltage on the straw is large, then electrostatic forces can be as large as (or

Figure 3-3 and Figure 3-4 show different output signal behaviours as a function of the straw voltage. Figure 3-3 is related to the case shown in the bottom part of Figure 3-2. If the straw voltage is high enough, the wire is falls into a circular mode of vibration and the sensitivity of the method is reduced. Figure 3-4 corresponds to the case which is close to that shown in the top part of Figure 3-2. At voltages above 800 V, the wire has a circular mode of vibration, which leads to an increase of the difference between \(\mathbf{R_{max}}\) and \(\mathbf{R_{min}}\) and, hence, to an increase of the output signal from the amplifier. One should note that this voltage effect becomes dominant in both cases above 600 V. At lower voltages, the output signal amplitude varies linearly with the voltage, and the capacitance variation method can be used reliably.

In order to extract the wire-vibration amplitude from the measurements of the output signal, the charge-sensitive amplifier has to be properly calibrated over the range of the wire vibration frequencies. This calibration was made by means of a sinusoidal signal sent through a calibration capacitance of 3.3 pF. If \(\mathbf{C_{c}}\) is the calibration capacitance value and \(\mathbf{A_{c}}\) the calibration signal amplitude (peak to peak) then the charge variation (\(\delta\mathbf{Q}\)) measured during wire vibration is:

\[\delta\mathrm{Q}\;=\;\mathrm{C_{c}A_{c}\frac{A_{outvibr}}{A_{outcalibr}}}\] (3-3)

Where \(\mathbf{A_{outvibr}}\) and \(\mathbf{A_{outcalibr}}\) are the output signal amplitudes measured for the vibration and the calibration tests. On the other hand, if \(\mathrm{U}\) is the straw voltage:

\[\delta\mathrm{Q}\;=\;\delta\mathrm{C\cdot U}\]Hence, using Equation 2-2 and averaging over the straw, one obtains:

\[\overline{\mathrm{R(x)}_{\mathrm{max}}^{2}-\mathrm{R(x)}_{\mathrm{min}}^{2}}\;=\; \frac{\delta\mathrm{Q}}{\mathrm{C}_{0}\mathrm{U}}\mathrm{b}^{2}\ln\mathrm{b}/a\]

Where \(\mathbf{R(x)_{\mathrm{max}}}\) and \(\mathbf{R(x)_{\mathrm{min}}}\) now depend on the position \(\mathbf{x}\) along the straw. In first approximation, for wire-vibration amplitudes smaller than the wire offset, the wire deviation from the straw centre as a function of the distance from one end of the straw can be described by a **sine** law:

\[\mathrm{R(x)}_{\mathrm{max}}\;=\;\mathrm{R}_{\mathrm{max}}\cdot\;\sin\!\left( \frac{\mathrm{x}}{\mathrm{L}}\cdot\pi\right)\]

where \(\mathbf{x}\) is the position along the straw, \(\mathbf{L}\) is the straw length and \(\mathbf{R_{\mathrm{max}}}\) is the maximum distance of the wire from the straw centre. Then:

\[\overline{\mathrm{R(x)}_{\mathrm{max}}^{2}}\;=\;\int\limits_{\mathrm{o}}^{\pi }\!\!\left(\mathrm{R}_{\mathrm{max}}\cdot\;\sin\!\phi\right)^{2}\mathrm{d}\phi \;=\;\frac{1}{2}\cdot\mathrm{R}_{\mathrm{max}}^{2}\]

And, finally:

\[\mathrm{R}_{\mathrm{max}}^{2}-\mathrm{R}_{\mathrm{min}}^{2}\;=\;\frac{2\delta \mathrm{Q}}{\mathrm{C}_{0}\mathrm{U}}\mathrm{b}^{2}\ln\mathrm{b}/a\,.\] (3-4)

where \(\mathbf{R_{\mathrm{max}}}\) and \(\mathbf{R_{\mathrm{min}}}\) now are maximum and minimum deviation of the wire from the straw centre.

There are two cases, which should be considered for a study of the wire-vibration amplitude: the maximum and minimum sensitivity. Schematically, they are presented in Figure 3-5. If \(\mathbf{D}\) is the maximum wire offset, \(\Delta\) is the maximum (peak to peak) amplitude of the wire vibration, and \(|\sin\!\alpha|\!\geq\!\Delta/(2\mathrm{D})\), then, for the case **a)** in Figure 3-5:

\[\mathrm{R}_{\mathrm{max}}^{2}-\mathrm{R}_{\mathrm{min}}^{2}\;=\;2\Delta \mathrm{D}\sin\!\alpha\]

For a maximum deviation of the wire from its position due to vibration, which happens at the middle of the straw where, usually, the wire offset is maximum as well (\(\mathbf{D_{\mathrm{max}}}\)), one obtains:

\[\Delta_{\mathrm{max}}\;=\;\frac{\delta\mathrm{Q}}{\mathrm{C}_{\mathrm{o}} \mathrm{UD}_{\mathrm{max}}\sin\!\alpha}\mathrm{b}^{2}\ln\mathrm{b}/a\] (3-5)

For \(\alpha\)=\(\pi/2\), the charge-variation method has maximum sensitivity. This means that even small vibrations produce output signals with relatively large amplitude. For the case **b)** in Figure 3-5, this method has minimum sensitivity

\[R_{\max}^{2}-R_{\min}^{2}\ =\ D^{2}+\left(\frac{\Delta}{2}\right)^{2}-D^{2}\ =\ \left(\frac{\Delta}{2}\right)^{2}\]

\[\Delta_{\max}^{2}\ =\ \frac{8\delta Q}{C_{\mathrm{o}}U}b^{2}\ln b/a\] (3-6)

One should note that this last result does not depend on the wire offset (parameter **D**) and that the signal from the amplifier will be observed with twice the vibration frequency.

The formulae above allow to calculate upper limits of the wire-vibration amplitude which can then be compared with direct test beam measurements.

## 4 Test beam calibration

Direct measurements of the wire-vibration amplitude were performed with a particle beam. Three types of straws with different lengths and different wire diameters were exposed to the H8 beam: two straws of 48 cm length and with wire diameters of 30 \(\upmu\)m and of 40 \(\upmu\)m and one straw of 75 cm length and with a wire diameter of 30 \(\upmu\)m.

The experimental setup is shown in Figure 4-6.

It consisted of three straws attached to a support. This support was fixed onto a special frame. Vibration is excited by means of a loud speaker fixed on the straw support near its centre. Vibrations were excited by means of a loud speaker fixed on the straw support near its centre. These vibrations were excited at the wire resonance frequency in a direction perpendicular to the test beam. In a first step the amplitude of the output signal for different voltages was measured with a calibrated charge-sensitive amplifier. In a second step the straw was connected to an ASDBLR-chip and the drift-time accuracy as a function of vibration amplitude was measured. The pion beam crossed the straws at their middle point, where the wire has its maximum amplitude of vibration. A precise Si-microstrip telescope was used to define the track-to-wire distance with an accuracy better than 10 \(\upmu\)m. The measurements were performed with the TRT standard gas

mixture and gas gain of 2.5\(\cdot\)10\({}^{4}\).

Figure 4-7 (left) shows the relationship between measured drift time and the distance to the wire, obtained from the extrapolation of the beam track reconstructed in the Si-microstrip telescope, for the straw of 75 cm length and 30 \(\upmu\)m wire diameter. The results are shown for no vibration (top) and for the maximum vibration amplitudes (bottom). Figure 4-7 (right) shows the distributions of the resulting residuals with respect to the beam track.

The observed asymmetry in the distribution shown in the scatter-plot provides an estimate of the parameter **D-sino** (see Figure 3-5), which is about 200 \(\upmu\)m in this particular case. It is important to note that the signals from the charge-sensitive amplifier for all wires in these beam tests had the standard resonance frequency. This means that all wire positions in the test straws are related to case **a)** of Figure 3-5.

The drift-time measurement accuracies as a function of the signal amplitude applied to the loud-speaker for all tested straws are shown in Figure 4-8. They are derived from a Gaussian fit to the right-hand distributions shown in Figure 4-7. The deterioration of the drift-time accuracy is not large, even for the maximum vibration amplitude. An upper limit on the drift-time accuracy component related to the wire vibration can be estimated from the difference between the first and the last points in each plot; the value obtained for each straw is shown in Table 4-2.

Figure 4-7: Left: correlation between track distance to wire (horizontal axis in mm) and measured drift time (vertical axis in ns) for no vibrations (top) and for the maximum vibration amplitude (bottom). Right: drift-time measurement residuals obtained in each case.

These results from test-beam data can be used to verify the capacitance-variation method. Table 4-2 shows the vibration-induced component of the drift-time measurement and from straw output signal measurements with a charge-sensitive amplifier.

urement accuracy, as calculated from the results of charge-variation measurements, using Equation 3-5 for the maximum vibration amplitude (\(\sigma=\Delta_{\mathrm{max}}/(\lambda/12)\)). Table 4-2 shows that the charge-variation method provides an even better accuracy than direct test-beam data if the parameter \(\mathrm{D}\cdot\sin\alpha\) is known. If this parameter is not known, then the formula for the calculation of the wire vibration amplitude should be chosen on the basis of the signal shape observed during the measurements (see Section 5). The values shown in Table 4-2 consistently demonstrate that the contribution of external vibration to the TRT straw drift-time accuracy is very small for excitation amplitudes not larger than maximum one induced with the loudspeaker method (the straw support could clearly be felt to vibrate with an amplitude larger than 10-20 \(\mathrm{\SIUnitSymbolMicro m}\) in this case).

## 5 Wire-vibration measurements using the RD6-wheel prototype.

The technique described above provides a reliable method to perform measurements of the wire vibration amplitudes with large objects, such as the assembled TRT end-cap wheels or barrel modules. As mentioned in Section 1, the major expected source of vibrations for the end-cap TRT is the cooling system, particularly, the cooling-medium distribution elements. It is important to mention that such studies must be performed with real-size prototypes with a design which is close the final one, because vibration modes and resonance frequencies are very strongly coupled to the detailed mechanical design of the object under study.

As a first step of further systematic studies of wire vibrations in the TRT measurements with the RD6 wheel prototype have been performed, [8-3]. The design of the RD6 wheel is not exactly the same as for the final TRT end-cap wheels, but it is close enough. A 45\({}^{\mathrm{o}}\) azimuthal sector of the RD6 wheel was equipped with a gas distribution manifold at the inner radius and with a foil, needed to force the cooling gas flow between straws inside of the wheel, as shown in, Figure 5-9. The cooling gas is injected through holes of 2 mm diameter which are circumferentially positioned with a step of ~7 cm along the manifold.

Measurements were performed for the maximum gas flow (F\({}_{\mathrm{max}}\)) and for a gas flow two times larger than F\({}_{\mathrm{max}}\). The maximum gas flow for any type of wheels is defined as the gas flow, which is needed to evacuate twice the expected amount of heat at the design luminosity of the LHC. This safety factor of 2 for the heat load was included to take into account the maximum envisaged TRT gas gain (3.5\(\cdot\)10\({}^{4}\)) and the physics uncertainties on the simulation of the background counting rates.

Under these assumptions, F\({}_{\mathrm{max}}\) is about 50 m\({}^{3}\)/h for the type-C end-cap wheels. The wire vibration amplitudes were measured for the first rows of straws, closest to the gas manifold, and for some straws along the z-direction, as shown in Figure 5-10.

Straws with a wire diameter of 50 \(\mathrm{\SIUnitSymbolMicro m}\) and of 30 \(\mathrm{\SIUnitSymbolMicro m}\) were examined (32 straws of each type were measured). The measurements were performed at voltages of 500 V and 1500 V. One should note here that no significant difference of vibration amplitude was found for straws positioned in the first straw layer (closest to the gas manifold) and for straws in the middle layers.

The measured wire vibration frequency did not correspond exactly to the wire resonance frequency, but it reasonably close to it (160-180 Hz instead of \(\sim\)220 Hz). This probably means that the largest part of vibration energy is dissipated into the mechanical structure, which oscillates at its own frequency, thus forcing the wire to vibrate at the same frequency. The fact that no indication of any signal with twice the resonant frequency was observed allows to conclude that the wire vibration conditions are close to that shown in Figure 3-5, **a**). In this case, the maximum vibration amplitude is:

\[\Delta^{2}_{\rm max}\,=\,\frac{2\delta\rm Q}{C_{o}U}b^{2}\ln b/a\,:\] (5-7)

Table 5-3 summarises the results obtained from these measurements as upper limits on the vibration-induced component of the straw drift-time accuracy for two different gas flows and wire diameters. In this case also, the measurements demonstrate that the impact of vibration on the TRT performance is negligible

## 6 Conclusions and Recommendations

Direct test-beam measurements have been successfully performed to validate quantitatively the charge-variation method for measuring the amplitude of the wire vibrations in the TRT straw tubes. In the general case where the exact position of the wire with respect to the centre of the straw and the wire vibration mode are not known, this method provides an upper limit on the wire vibration amplitude.

The charge-variation method, as calibrated using test-beam measurements, shows that the drift-time accuracy of individual straws is not affected significantly over a wide range of possible excitation amplitudes. Similar measurements performed using the RD6 wheel prototype equipped with a realistic cooling gas manifold demonstrate directly that possible vibrations induced by the cooling gas flow have a negligible impact on the straw drift-time accuracy.

This charge-variation method does not require any complex nor heavy equipment and will therefore be used fro larger-scale tests of final TRT wheels or modules, even when they will have been assembled into the overall Inner Detector.
