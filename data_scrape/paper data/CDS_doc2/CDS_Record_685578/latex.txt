**Abstract.**

We present the results of measurements on the Resistive Plate Chambers (RPC) installed in the RD5 experiment. We studied the working parameters of RPC, the relation between the incident particle flux and the detection efficiency for single and double gap RPC, the time resolution for different incident particle fluxes, and we present a preliminary determination of the space accuracy.

**The RD5 experiment.**

The purpose of the RD5 experiment at CERN [1] is to study the problems related to muon detection for future experiments at hadron colliders. The layout of the RD5 experiment is shown in Fig.1. It consists of two magnets: the superconducting magnet of the EHS experiment, producing a 3 T field, followed by an iron torus producing 1.5 T field. In front of the EHS magnet there is a beam defining scintillator hodoscope, a tracker of silicon microstrips and multiwire proportional chambers and, four RPC of 50x50 cm\({}^{2}\) equipped with 0.78 cm pitch strips, read out with an analogic chain. A tracking calorimeter, TRACAL, of 10 interaction lengths made of stainless steel plates alternated with proportional gas tubes, honeycomb chambers, is installed inside the EHS magnet.

In front, in the middle and behind the iron magnet there are three muon measurement stations with large area drift chambers [2] and RPC. The first two stations are equipped with single gap RPC while Station 3 is equipped with double gap RPC. Single gap RPC are also inserted in two thin gaps in the first half of the torus. Fig.1 shows a perspective view of the drift chambers and RPC installed in Station 1.

**The Resistive Plate Chamber hodoscope.**

The RPC hodoscope consists of 16 planes of single gap and 4 planes of double gap chambers. Each plane has dimensions 2x2 m\({}^{2}\) and is equipped with 64 read out strips of 31 mm pitch. The planes are coupled in pairs providing one measurement in thehorizontal projection, z, and one in the vertical projection, y. Station 1 has four pairs with two y-z measurements before and after the drift chambers. There is one y-z pair in each of the two slots in the iron toroid. Station 2 has two y-z pairs single gap RPC with one measurement on either side of the drift chambers, in addition there is one double gap RPC plane reading the y coordinate on each side of the drift chambers. Also in Station 3 we have one plane of double gap RPC reading the y coordinate on each side of the drift chamber. Each plane provides a fast-OR signal of the 64 readout strips used for timing and trigger. For a description of the RPC construction and parameters see [3].

**Performance of the Resistive Plate Chambers.**

Chambers with two different resistivity of the electrode plates have been tested. The resistivity of the electrodes is an important parameter that defines the recovery time of the electric field after a local discharge and thus influence the efficiency of the chamber as function of the particle flux. Low resistivity chambers, \(\rho\) = 4 10\({}^{10}\)\(\Omega\)xcm, were placed in Station 1, where a larger flux of particles is expected from the leakage of hadron showers in the tracking calorimeter, and in Station 2 and 3 (double gap RPC). The chambers in the slots of the iron magnet and single gap RPC in Station 2 have resistivity a factor of about 5 higher.

Most of the data were taken with the chambers filled with a gas mixture of 58% argon, 38% n-butane and 3.8% of freon. The supply voltage was 7.0 kV and 7.2 kV for the low and high resistivity chambers respectively. The efficiency, averaged over the whole surface of the chambers, was measured using the fast-OR signals with muons of the beam halo and was, on average, 96%. The rate of the fast-OR signal was, on average, 5 kHz/m\({}^{2}\) (0.5 kHz/m\({}^{2}\)) for the low (high) resistivity chambers. The probability of accidental hits in coincidence with a trigger was between 10-3 and 10-4 per plane. Fig.2 shows the behavior of the power supply current and of the fast-OR rate, as a function of the high voltage, for two extreme cases of chambers that differ in resistivity of the electrode planes.

The performance of the chambers was studied by tracking high momentum muons, 100-300 GeV/c, through the different planes. Signals from adjacent strips were grouped in clusters, then tracks were defined with a least square fit to a straight line. Fig.3 shows the distribution of the residuals from the track fitted in the non-bending projection: the average r.m.s space resolution is 8 mm.

The efficiency of each plane was measured requiring that a hit is found in three strips centered on the line fitted requiring the presence of at least three other planes. At low beam intensity, for muon fluxes smaller than 10 Hz/cm\({}^{2}\), the efficiency for the different chambers varies between 94% and 99%. Fig.4 shows the efficiency as a function of the muon flux in different chambers. For this measurement the beam was defined by two scintillators of dimensions 10x15 cm\({}^{2}\) and 15x15 cm\({}^{2}\) respectively and the particle flux was measured by the rate of the 10x15 cm\({}^{2}\) scintillator and of a smaller scintillator of dimensions 4x4 cm\({}^{2}\) centered on the beam line. The particle flux was conservatively estimated as that measured on a 10x15 cm\({}^{2}\) surface with a 4x4 cm\({}^{2}\) hole in the center. The scintillators rate was uniform over the 2.6 s of the extraction cycle of the beam: thus the data shown in Fig.4 represent the average efficiency over this time interval. A significant degradation in efficiency is observed in the RPC with high resistivity electrodes for particle fluxes larger than 20 Hz/cm\({}^{2}\). The efficiency of low resistivity RPC degrades at fluxes larger than 50 Hz/cm\({}^{2}\). The behavior of the efficiency as a function of time during the beam extraction cycle is shown in Fig.5, for fluxes of 6, 64, 210 Hz/cm\({}^{2}\). We have divided the spill time in bins of \(\approx\) 80 ms and we measured the efficiency for each bin. For high resistivity chambers the efficiency drops during the time of the spill for fluxes greater than 15 Hz/cm\({}^{2}\) while the low resistivity chambers begin to loose efficiency only for fluxes higher than 50 Hz/cm\({}^{2}\). We fitted the results with a simple exponential form, A+Be-V\({}^{\dagger}\), where A represents the efficiency of the chamber as if exposed to a continuous flux of the same intensity of the one used for the measurement. The result of the fit is relevant only for high fluxes, and is presented in Table 1 for the average of five representative low resistivity and five high resistivity chambers for the run with the highest flux. The efficiency for continuous operation is much lower than the average efficiency measured during the beam spill.

\begin{tabular}{|c c|} \hline High resistivity & Low resistivity \\ \hline A = 0.246\(\pm\)0.007 & A = 0.59\(\pm\).02 \\ B = 0.487\(\pm\)0.009 & B = 0.37\(\pm\)0.02 \\ \(\tau\) = 0.68\(\pm\)0.04 s & \(\tau\) = 1.7\(\pm\)0.2 s \\ \hline \end{tabular}

Table 1

From this study we observe that the behavior of the RPC efficiency versus incident flux is dependent on the time interval during which we perform the efficiency measurement. To compare our results with previous measurements we have plotted in Fig 6 the efficiency of one low resistivity RPC and one high resistivity RPC, measured in the first 300 ms and in the whole spill (2.6 s), against the incident flux. Our 300 ms measurement for high resistivity RPC is compatible with the published data by Bertino et al [4], while it is not possible to compare these results with what has been published in [5] and [6] because the condition of the measurements is different, namely the illuminated area for our measurement is a small fraction of the total area while in [5] and [6] the whole surface of the RPC was irradiated.

**Double gap RPC.**

A double gap RPC consists of two single gap RPC assembled together as shown in Fig 7. The spacers used to keep the bakelite plates of each gap at a fixed distance of 2 mm represent a dead area for each RPC of the order of 1% of the full area. We have staggered the position of these spacers in the two gaps in such a way to eliminate the dead area. The read out is done by a strip plane inserted between the two RPCs, in this way we expect to have an efficiency close to 100% and also a better time resolution. The measured efficiency for double gap RPC is (99.9 \(\pm\) 0.1)%. We studied the dependence of the efficiency from the incident flux for double gap RPC. The behavior is very similar to that measured with single gap low resistivity RPC, this is due to the spatial correlation of the discharge point in the two gaps, so that in this respect we cannot consider the two gaps as independent.

RPC Time and Space Resolution.We measured the time and space resolution of single gap RPC using four small 50x50 cm\({}^{2}\) RPC, read out by 0.78 cm pitch strips. These chambers were positioned in front of the EHS magnet at a distance of 57 cm from the last plane of the silicon tracker, which measures the impact position of the incoming particle on the RPC planes with an error of = 30 \(\upmu\)m. We equipped 12 strips per plane and we read them out with a LeCroy 2249A, 11-bit resolution, integrating ADC. The gain of the electronic channels were equalized injecting a fixed charge at the input of the read out chain. The gate signal to each ADC, 50 ns long, was given by the coincidence of the RD5 trigger signal with the fast-OR signal generated by each chamber. Each chamber forms the fast-OR signal discriminating the analog sum of the four strips illuminated by the beam. This signal, delayed, has been also used to send the stop to a LeCroy 2228A TDC used for the timing measurement, the start being given by the RD5 trigger signal. Each bin in Fig.8 corresponds to 50 ps.

Time Resolution measurement.In Fig 8 it is shown the distribution of the difference between the arrival time of the RD5 trigger signal and the fast-OR signal generated by each RPC. We fitted this distribution with a gaussian function, whose width gives the time resolution of the system (RD5 trigger + RPC). After unfolding the jitter due to the trigger we find that the time resolution of the RPC is (1.8 \(\pm\) 0.1) ns. We have to remark that there is a significative non gaussian tail towards long delays in the distribution, for example with a 3 \(\sigma\) cut one looses 7% of the events. This problem could be solved using double gap RPC, the expected time distribution for the double gap RPC has been calculated folding two measured time distributions for a single gap RPC in an uncorrelated way. With this device we expect to reduce to 1.3% the number of events that would fail a 3 \(\sigma\) cut. The time formation of the signal is also very sensitive to the applied voltage and to the incident particle flux. In Fig 9 we show the measured time resolution for different incident fluxes and the time resolution for different values of the applied voltage.

Space resolution measurement.The reconstruction of the impact position of a charged particle has been done using the center of gravity method. From the study of the charge profile on the strips we deduce that there are five strips with a signal greater than the noise. In Fig.10 we show the correlation between the impact position as extrapolated from the silicon telescope on the RPC planes and the center of gravity calculated using five strips. From these plots we can conclude that the intrinsic resolution of the chambers is rather good, but there are some systematic effects, that are only in part due to the position reconstruction method, that we still have to take into account.

To measure the position resolution we studied the distribution of the difference between the impact position given by the center of gravity method and the position given by the extrapolation of the track from the silicon telescope, Fig.11. We fitted this distribution with a Gaussian function and we obtained a position resolution of 280 \(\mu\)m. We have to remark that at this stage of the analysis no cut and no systematic correction has been applied. To take into account the effect of the systematic error due to the position reconstruction method it is necessary to know the distribution of the charge induced on the strips. To fit this distribution we have chosen the following function [7]:

\[Q_{i}=\int_{S_{i}}\left[A/cosh((x-x_{0})/\delta)\right]dx \tag{1}\]

where \(Q_{i}\) is the charge induced on strip \(s_{i}\), \(x_{0}\) is the particle position and \(\delta\) is the width of the charge distribution. In figure 12 we show the fit to an event and the distribution of the width of the charge function on a sample of 425 events centered on one strip 1. The average value of the \(\delta\) parameter is 4.1 mm, in reasonable agreement with what expected from the dimensions of the chamber, and also with what has already been measured in [7] using a different method.

Footnote 1: The fit procedure introduces a correlation between the particle position and the width \(\delta\), which tends to increase the value of \(\delta\) on the edge of the strips.

Knowing the value of the \(\delta\) parameter we can evaluate the systematic error in the reconstructed position due to the center of gravity method and compare it with the measured systematic error. In Fig 13 it is shown the behavior of the systematic error, defined as the difference between the center of gravity position and the particle position extrapolated from the silicon tracker, as a function of the center of gravity position. The dashed line superimposed represents the systematic error as derived from the charge distribution [1]. Subtracting on event basis the systematic error given by the previous calculation we obtain the distribution shown in fig 14. The width of this distribution is 250 \(\mu\)m and there are no big non Gaussian tails, the number of events that fail a 3 \(\sigma\) cut is 2 %.

**Conclusions.**

We have studied the behavior of the RPC installed in the RD5 experiment. We noticed that during the 2.6 s of the beam spill, there is a decrease of the efficiency when the particle flux is bigger than few Hz/cm\({}^{2}\), and for this reason it will be very important to measure the efficiency of those chambers when illuminated by a continuous particle flux. A comparison of the behavior of RPC built with plates of different resistivity shows that low resistivity chambers have significant better efficiency at fluxes larger than 10 Hz/cm\({}^{2}\). We have shown that double gap RPC of low resistivity have full efficiency and the flux capabilities are similar to those of single gap low resistivity RPC. The measurements that we presented confirm the good timing resolution already measured for these chambers (\(\sigma_{t}=1.8\) ns). We measured for the first time the spatial accuracy for RPC using the center of gravity method. We found that, with 0.78 cm pitch read out strip, the spatial resolution is \(\sigma_{S}=250\mu\)m.
