###### Abstract

The decay of heavy gauge bosons \(Z_{H}\) and \(W_{H}\) into hadrons is analysed in the context of the 'Little Higgs model'. The mass of these heavy bosons is assumed to be 1 or 2 TeV and decay modes involving b-quarks or t-quarks are investigated.

## 1 Introduction

Heavy gauge bosons \(Z_{H}\) and \(W_{H}\) are predicted in the context of the so-called 'Little Higgs model' [1]. These particles are similar to the usual gauge bosons Z and W, but their masses are expected to be in the TeV region. Within the simplest model, described in [2], \(Z_{H}\) and \(W_{H}\) are degenerate in mass. The discovery potential of ATLAS for these heavy particles has been investigated in detail elsewhere [3]. It has been shown that, if \(Z_{H}\) and \(W_{H}\) exist, they can be reconstructed using as discovery channels their leptonic decays, \(Z_{H}\to e^{+}e^{-}\) and \(W_{H}\to e\,\nu_{e}\), up to masses of 5 to 6 TeV. In this note, the much more challenging hadronic channels \(Z_{H}\to b\,\overline{b}\), \(t\,\overline{t}\) and \(W_{H}\to t\,b\) are investigated. These channels are more difficult to detect but may provide very useful information about \(Z_{H}\) and \(W_{H}\), in case a resonance is found in any of the leptonic channels mentioned before. More precisely, the detection of these hadronic decay channels should allow a measurement of the couplings between heavy gauge bosons and quarks.

## 2 Cross-sections and Branching ratios

According to [2], the couplings of \(Z_{H}\) and \(W_{H}\) depend on a single parameter: the \(\theta\) angle. This value is not really constrained in the model, but for practical reasons, the value cot\(\theta=1\) is assumed as an example in the following. The cross-sections at LHC have been calculated using PYTHIA with proper couplings1 and CTEQ5L PDF's. The results are displayed in table 1.

Footnote 1: These proper couplings are the following in the case of Z’:

PARU(I) = cos\(\theta_{W}\) (I = 121,... 128), PARJ(I) = cos\(\theta_{W}\) (I = 180,... 195),

where \(\theta_{W}\) is the Weinberg angle. In this way the couplings of \(Z^{\prime}\) agree with those of \(Z_{H}\) as defined in reference [2]. The couplings of \(W^{\prime}\) and \(W_{H}\) agree without any further modification.

The BR's and total widths of \(Z_{H}\) and \(W_{H}\) can be deduced from the information provided in [2]. Neglecting QCD corrections and fermion masses (also for top quark), the total widths of \(Z_{H}\) and \(W_{H}\) are equal. The result is:

\[\Gamma/M=[\,3.4\ cot^{2}\theta+0.071\ cot^{2}2\theta\,]\,\%\]

where the first term includes all possible fermion decays and the second term only the higgs decays \(Z_{H}\to Zh\) and \(W_{H}\to Wh\), where \(h\) is the standard model Higgs boson.

As a consequence of gauge symmetry, all branching ratios of \(Z_{H}\) and \(W_{H}\) to fermions are equal, except for the usual colour factor of 3 (in case of quarks) or 1 (in case of leptons). It follows that \(Zh\) and \(Wh\) decays vanish if cot\(\theta\) = 1 (therefore cot\(2\theta\) = 0) and the Branching Ratios to heavy quarks are:

\[BR(Z_{H}\to b\ \overline{b})=BR(Z_{H}\to t\ \overline{t})=1/8=12.5\%\]

\[BR(W_{H}\to t\ b)=1/4=25\%\]

All possible values of cot\(\theta\) are considered in the following.

## 3 Event simulation

Most of the events have been generated using the MC program PYTHIA (version 6.157) coupled to ATLFAST [4] to simulate the detector response. The MC program ALPGEN [5] has been used as well to generate \(Wb\overline{b}\) events. The heavy gauge bosons Z' and W' of PYTHIA were used for \(Z_{H}\) and \(W_{H}\). The corresponding couplings were taken from reference [2]. The production mechanisms 141 (\(f\overline{f}_{i}\to\gamma/Z/Z^{\prime}\)) and 142 (\(f_{i}\overline{f}_{j}\to W^{\prime}\)) were selected to generate \(Z_{H}\) and \(W_{H}\), respectively.

The following sets of events were used in the analysis:

* Signal: \(Z_{H}\to b\;\overline{b}\), \(t\;\overline{t}\) and \(W_{H}\to t\;b\) with M(\(Z_{H}\)) = M(\(W_{H}\)) = 1 and 2 TeV. Samples of 10 000 events were generated for each decay and mass value except for \(Z_{H}\to t\;\overline{t}\) (20 000 events) and \(W_{H}\to t\;b\) (100 000 events) in both cases with M = 1 TeV.
* Background: Standard Model final states containing \(b\overline{b}\), \(t\overline{t}\), 2 \(jets\) and \(W\)\(+jets\). Since only events with very high \(p_{T}\) jets and large center of mass energy are relevant in the analysis, it was imposed at the generation level that \(\sqrt{\hat{s}}>0.5\;(1.0)\) TeV and \(\hat{p}_{T}>0.1\;(0.25)\) TeV, where \(\sqrt{\hat{s}}\) and \(\hat{p}_{T}\) are the center-of-mass energy and transverse momentum of the hard process. The low cuts were used in the background estimation for M = 1 TeV, and the high cuts for M = 2 TeV. Samples of 100 000 events were generated for each final state, except for the \(t\;\overline{t}\) sample with low cuts (2M events). Other backgrounds like single top production and \(Z+jets\) events were not simulated since the expected yields for the present analysis are negligible. For single top production, the program ZTOP [6] predicts, for \(p_{T}(top)>100\) GeV, a cross-section of \(\sigma=30\) pb, to be compared with an expected cross-section for double-top of \(\sigma=5100\) pb. The cross-section for \(Z+jets\) events is expected to be a factor 10 smaller than the cross-section for \(W+jets\), once the leptonic branching ratios of the gauge bosons are taken into account. Furthermore, \(Z+jets\) events are suppressed in the present analysis by requiring missing energy.

The MC event samples are such that the statistical fluctuations correspond aproximately to the following integrated luminosities for real data: \(\mathcal{L}=3\cdot 10^{4}\;pb^{-1}\) for M = 1 TeV and \(\mathcal{L}=3\cdot 10^{5}\;pb^{-1}\) for M = 2 TeV.

## 4 Event analysis

The cuts used in the present analysis are summarized below. Many of the cuts used in this analysis have been used in previous ATLAS work (see for example reference [3]). A search for resonances decaying into top quarks is also found in the Physics TDR, section 18.1.4.2 [7], where some of the cuts used here have been applied as well.

For the analysis of the decay \(Z_{H}\to b\;\overline{b}\), the following cuts are applied for M = 1 (2) TeV, respectively:* 2 b-jets with \(p_{T}>250\) (500) GeV and \(|\eta|<2.5\).

The b-tagging of very high \(p_{T}\) jets for this mode and also for the following modes is discussed in the Appendix. Two background sources have been analysed: \(b\)\(\overline{b}\) production (irreducible background) and \(2\)\(jet\) production (reducible background).

For the analysis of the decay \(Z_{H}\to t\,\overline{t}\), the following cuts are applied for M = 1 (2) TeV, respectively, assuming that one of the t-quarks decays leptonically:

* A lepton (electron or muon) with \(p_{T}>25\) GeV and \(|\eta|<2.5\), and in addition \((E_{T})_{miss}>25\) GeV (this cut is also useful to fulfil the trigger requirements). The lepton \(p_{T}\) distribution before cuts is shown in figure 1. 
* 2 b-jets with \(p_{T}>25\) GeV and \(|\eta|>2.5\), the first jet such that \(\Delta\)R(b-lepton) \(<2\) and the second such that \(\Delta\)R(b-lepton) \(>2\). The distance \(\Delta\)R is defined in the usual way as \[\Delta R=\sqrt{(\Delta\phi)^{2}+(\Delta\eta)^{2}}\] where \(\phi\) is the azimuthal angle and \(\eta\) is the pseudorapidity. It is noted that the \(\Delta\)R cut is useful to identify the b-jet from the leptonic decay of the top-quark and the b-jet from the hadronic decay of the top-quark (see fig. 2), but does not provide any significant discrimination against the background, since this background is mainly irreducible.

Figure 1: Distribution of the lepton \(p_{T}\) before cuts for M = 1 TeV in the process \(Z_{H}\to t\,\overline{t}\). The event scale is arbitrary.

* The first t-quark is reconstructed using the first b-quark, the lepton, and the missing energy, assuming that the missing neutrino is parallel to the lepton. The second t-quark is reconstructed using the second b-quark and all other jets, within a distance of 2. The \(p_{T}\) of the reconstructed t-quarks (see fig. 3) should satisfy the cut \(p_{T}>250\) (500) GeV.

The approximation of assuming the neutrino and the lepton parallel (inspired by \(\tau\) searches in ATLAS) yields good results for M \(>\) 1 TeV. The longitudinal momentum of the neutrino can also be calculated using the equation \(m_{W}^{2}=(p_{l}+p_{\nu})^{2}\), where \(p_{l}\) and \(p_{\nu}\) are the 4-momenta of the lepton and the neutrino. This second approximation yields also goods results for M \(<\) 1 TeV, but has not been used in the present analysis.

Figure 3: Distribution of the reconstructed top \(p_{T}\) before cuts for M = 1 TeV in the process \(Z_{H}\to t\;\overline{t}\). The event scale is arbitrary.

Figure 2: Distribution of \(\Delta\)R(b-lepton) in the process \(Z_{H}\to t\;\overline{t}\) for M = 1 TeV. The b-jet from the top leptonic decay is called b1 and the b-jet from the top hadronic decay is called b2. The event scale is arbitrary. These distributions are obtained at the parton level.

For the analysis of the decay \(W_{H}\to t\,b\), where the t-quark is assumed to decay leptonically, the selection proceeds in the same way as in the \(Z_{H}\to t\,\overline{t}\) case, except that no energy is collected around the second b-quark, since in this case this b-quark is the only component of the second jet. For both decays, \(Z_{H}\to t\,\overline{t}\) and \(W_{H}\to t\,b\), the dominant background is \(t\,\overline{t}\) production (irreducible). Another background source, \(W+jets\) production (reducible), has been considered as well.

The kinematical efficiencies achieved for signal events by the selection cuts described before are summarized in table 2. This efficiencies decrease at large mass values because leptons from top decays are less isolated.

The reconstructed mass peaks are shown in fig. 4a \(-\) 4f. The corresponding mean values and widths resulting from gaussian fits are reported in table 3.

Since the natural width of \(Z_{H}\) and \(W_{H}\) is 34 GeV for M = 1 TeV (assuming cot\(\theta\) = 1), the reconstructed mass width is dominated by fragmentation and experimental effects (detector resolution). The invariant mass distributions showing the signal on top of the expected background are shown in fig. 5a \(-\) 5f. By applying mass cuts of \(\pm\) 200 (400) GeV around the expected mass values of M = 1 (2) TeV, it is possible to obtain the number of signal and background events reported in tables 4 and 5 for an integrated luminosity of \(\mathcal{L}=3\cdot 10^{5}\)\(pb^{-1}\), corresponding to 3 years of running at high luminosity. The significance of the expected signal is indicated as well for all decays. The significance has in general a large value around M = 1 TeV, well above the discovery threshold of 5, but only the decay \(W_{H}\to t\,b\) yields a signal which can be clearly separated from the background as shown in fig. 5.

For the \(t\overline{t}\) and \(tb\) channels, the irreducible background consists of \(t\overline{t}\) events and the reducible background of \(W+jets\) events. The reducible background can be computed using both PYTHIA and ALPGEN. The values obtained with ALPGEN are larger and have been used, in a conservative approach, to calculate the various significances.

Figure 5: The same as in fig. 4, but including both signal and background. The mass windows used to calculate the significance are indicated in the figures. A luminosity of \(\mathcal{L}=3\cdot 10^{4}\)\(pb^{-1}\) is assumed for M = 1  TeV and \(\mathcal{L}=3\cdot 10^{5}\)\(pb^{-1}\) for M = 2  TeV. Note: reducible background obtained with ALPGEN.

Assuming that for the \(W_{H}\to t\,b\) channel the signal can be extracted, it is possible to deduce the discovery region for this decay indicated in fig. 6. The discovery region is the region with significance exceeding the value of 5. This region has been obtained assuming that the cross-section is proportional to \((cot\theta)^{2}\) and extrapolating the results (for both signal and background) obtained for masses of 1 and 2 TeV to other mass values.

## 5 Summary and conclusions

The decays \(Z_{H}\to b\,\overline{b},\ t\,\overline{t}\) and \(W_{H}\to t\,b\) have been investigated using the simulation program ATLFAST for \(Z_{H}\) and \(W_{H}\) mass values of 1 and 2 TeV. The analysis of expected signals and backgrounds shows that the decays \(Z_{H}\to b\,\overline{b}\) and \(t\,\overline{t}\) are difficult to detect, but the decay \(W_{H}\to t\,b\), on the contrary, might yield a signal clearly separable from the background, up to \(W_{H}\) masses of 2.5 TeV, if \(\cot\theta\) is assumed to be equal to 1. The detection of the \(W_{H}\to t\,b\) signal will allow a measurement of \(\mbox{BR}(W_{H}\to t\,b)\) and, by comparison with \(\mbox{BR}(W_{H}\to l\,\nu)\), an interesting test for the couplings of the \(W_{H}\) boson.

Appendix: High \(p_{T}\)\(b\)-tagging

In all the decays analysed in the note, the tagging of very high \(p_{T}\) b-jets is required. The average \(p_{T}\) of these jets is reported in table 6:

The tagging of b-jets has been studied in detail within ATLAS (see for example [8]), but in all these studies the average \(p_{T}\) of b-jets was typically below 200 GeV. In order to investigate the b-tagging performance for larger \(p_{T}\) values, the following event samples have been generated and analysed:

\[Z_{H}(2\,TeV)\to b\;\overline{b},\;c\;\overline{c},\;u\;\overline{u}\]

Each sample contained 20 000 events and was processed using the full reconstruction provided by DC1 software. The b-tagging results were already used in a previous note [9].

The standard b-tagging algorithm was used. Since this algorithm is not optimized for high \(p_{T}\) jets, the results should be considered conservative, and further improvements might be expected in the future.

The efficiencies (\(\epsilon\)) and rejections (\(R=1/\epsilon\)) reported in table 7 have been applied in the analysis presented in this note.
