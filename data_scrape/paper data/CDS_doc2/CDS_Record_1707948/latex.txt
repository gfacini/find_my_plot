Table 1: Threshold calibration summary for different pixel types for 18 staves. Listed values are the standard deviation of the threshold, mean noise and its standard deviation, and mean threshold over noise and its standard deviation. Both tunings were performed for a 10 BC Time-over-Threshold (ToT) response at 16000 \(e\). Long pixels of planar sensors are listed separately as they show a higher noise due to their larger pixel size. The measured threshold does not represent the in-time threshold, as no timing constraints were set. The number of pixels per type are 11321900, 290304, 1935360 and 1935360 for normal planar, long planar, 3D FBK and 3D CNM pixels, respectively.

Figure 3: (b) Threshold and (b) noise distributions after tuning all pixels to a target threshold of 1500 \(e\) at -12oC module temperature for 18 staves. The pixels are displayed in four categories according to normal and long pixels on planar sensors as well as pixels on FBK and CNM 3D sensors. The small peak around 2150 \(e\) in (a) is an artifact of one mask step in the threshold scan, where noisy pixels bias the s-curve. By redoing the threshold scan and injecting in less pixels per mask step, the incorrect measurement can be avoided, but for this particular chip it was not done due to time constraints. The bump around 300 \(e\) in (b) is caused by a small noise on the HV line of the setup and the sensitivity of FBK modules to such noise. No constraints on timing were set for the threshold measurement.

Figure 2: (a) Threshold and (b) noise distributions after tuning all pixels to a target threshold of 3000 \(e\) at 22oC module temperature for the 14 IBL staves. The pixels are displayed in four categories according to normal and long pixels on planar sensors as well as pixels on FBK and CNM 3D sensors.

Figure 4: (b) Threshold and (b) noise distributions after tuning all pixels to a target threshold of 1500 \(e\) at -12 \({}^{\circ}\)C module temperature for the 14 IBL staves. The pixels are displayed in four categories according to normal and long pixels on planar sensors as well as pixels on FBK and CNM 3D sensors.

Figure 5: Threshold over noise distribution of pixels for (a) 3000 \(e\) and (b) 1500 \(e\) threshold tunings at 22\({}^{\circ}\)C and -12\({}^{\circ}\)C module temperatures, respectively for 18 staves. The bump around a threshold to noise value of (a) 10 and (b) 5 is caused by a noise on HV lines of the setup and the sensitivity of FBK modules to such noise.

Figure 7: (a) Threshold and (b) noise chip-to-chip variation among the 18 production staves after tuning all pixels to a target threshold of 1500 \(e\) and to a 10 ToT target response for 16000 \(e\) at -12 \({}^{\circ}\)C module temperature. The individual pixel data have first been averaged over each chip. The plots show, for each chip position on the stave, the mean and scatter of the 18 data points (one from each stave). The error bars show the RMS spread, while the solid boxes show the minimum and maximum values. Noise on the outer 3D modules is generally higher than on the planar modules. Slightly higher noise is observed on the A-side of the setup. This is due to a combination of increased noise on the HV lines of this side to which both 3D sensors are sensitive and the fact that FBK modules, which show a higher mean noise than CNM modules, were more frequently chosen for loading on this side.

The individual pixel data have first been averaged over each chip. The plots show, for each chip position on the stave, the mean and scatter of the 14 data points (one from each stave).

## 2 Source scans

Figure 11: Cluster Time over Threshold (ToT) Most Probable Value (MPV) obtained from a \({}^{90}\)Sr source run by a chip-by-chip Landau-Gauss fit for all 18 staves, (a) shows the average as a function of chip number and (b) the distribution over all chips. (c) shows the distribution of the difference between cluster ToT and fitted chip MPV ToT. Only clusters with more than one hit were used. The staves were tuned to a threshold of 3000 \(e\) and 10 ToT BC for 16000 \(e\) charge at 22\({}^{\circ}\)C. The error bars in (a) show the RMS spread, while the solid boxes show the minimum and maximum values. The Landau-Gauss fit was performed only on clusters with more than one hit to reduce the noise and low energy hit contamination, which is dominant due to the \({}^{90}\)Sr source scan being performed in selftrigger mode. The Landau-Gauss fit is therefore biased to higher values and cannot be used for absolute charge calculations, but it is suitable for chip by chip comparisons.

Figure 14: Overlay of the total number of disconnected pixels for planar sensors with a picture of an IBL module for (a) 18 staves and for (b) the 14 IBL staves. As disconnected bumps are determined by the number of hits in a source scan, a very low occupancy underneath passive components could cause a systemic misidentification. No clear correlation between the geographical location, other than edge regions, and high numbers of disconnected bumps is observed.

Figure 15: Total fraction of disconnected pixels on 3D (top) and planar (bottom) sensors as a function of chip row and column numbers for all 18 staves (left) and the 14 IBL staves (right). Disconnected bumps clearly tend to be located in the outer columns and rows.

Figure 16: Total fraction of disconnected pixels on 3D (top) and planar (bottom) sensors as a function of chip row and column numbers for all 18 staves (left) and the 14 IBL staves (right). The plots are zoomed into the respective corners of the chips.

Figure 17: Total fraction of bad but not disconnected pixels as a function of chip row and column numbers for (a) all 18 staves and (b) the 14 IBL staves. Pixel failures other than disconnected bumps are distributed over the whole chip.

Figure 19: Number of bad pixels per stave for (a) 20 staves, (b) 18 staves and (c)14 installed staves.

Figure 18: Bad pixel fraction per chip for (a) 18 staves and (b) 14 installed staves. Chips with less than 100 bad pixels were the target for IBL, some outliers are visible as this cut was relaxed at the end of the production, due shortness of modules. 73% and 75% of all chips on 18 staves and on 14 installed staves have less than 0.1% bad pixels, respectively.

Table 4: Ranking and loading order overview of the 14 IBL staves. The position is sequential around the beam pipe. The cooling pipe of the stave in position 01 is at \(\phi=-6.1^{\circ}\), subsequent staves are displaced by \(25.7^{\circ}\) in \(\phi\). The score is determined by the number of bad pixels, each of which is weighted according to the position on a stave. A lower score thus translates into a higher quality stave. The planarity shows the difference between the minimum and maximum height of a stave. The last column indicates whether a stave has been reworked at the CERN DSF bond lab. For completeness, the bottom four lines show numbers for the staves that were not chosen for installation. For the stave loading around the beam pipe, not only this score but a uniform \(\eta-\phi\) bad pixel distribution and engineering constraints are also taken into account.
