**Mandates for the ID Sub-System Project Leaders and ID Project Engineer**

Introduction

The ID Project Leader responsibilities are defined in the ATLAS System Organisation (*). This document states:

"While the responsibility to the ATLAS Collaboration remains at all times with the Project Leader, he or she may choose to delegate some tasks, or to appoint such people as project engineer, electronics project engineer, s/w responsible, etc. to assist in managing the project. Such appointments must specify a clear set of responsibilities; they shall be approved by the Steering Group and confirmed by the Institute Board."

Each ID sub-system (Pixels, SCT and TRT) is led by a sub-system Project Leader. This document lays out their mandates and areas of responsibility. It also defines the roles of the sub-system Steering Groups which they chair, and the role of the ID Project Engineer.

Work Definition of ID Sub-System Project Leaders

The Sub-System Project Leader (SSPL) is responsible to the ID community for ensuring that the design and construction of the corresponding sub-system is carried out on schedule, within the cost ceiling agreed by the ID Institute Board, and in a way that guarantees the required performance and reliability, within the framework of the ATLAS resource planning. The SSPL shall bring up for discussion with the ID management incompatibilities between the required project development and the available resources.

The SSPL chairs a sub-system Steering Group, which shall contain sufficient technical expertise to advise the SSPL on any matter affecting the sub-system implementation. He or she shall maintain continuous communication with the Steering Group, keeping it updated on the development of the project and consulting it on questions of major importance. In the case of the Pixel and TRT sub-systems, the Steering Group shall contain at least one representative per participating Institution. The Steering Group can then decide on sharing of work within the sub-system, provided that the budget ceiling of the sub-system, and the ATLAS resource planning is respected.

In the case of the SCT, the large number of Institutes involved means that the Steering Group must be restricted to technical issues. The SSPL for the SCT shall therefore also convene an Institute Board, with one representative per institute, which agrees on the sharing of responsibilities within the SCT project, provided that the budget ceiling of the sub-system,and the ATLAS resource planning is respected. Technical recommendations are approved by the Institute Board. It need not be chaired by the SSPL.

Each SSPL shall appoint one professional engineer from the sub-system community as sub-system project engineer. This engineer shall represent the sub-system at meetings called by the ID Project Engineer.

The tasks of the SSPL's include, but are not limited to:

* Preparing all decisions in the sub-detector community, by activating all the necessary studies and forums, thus making sure that everyone has the opportunity to express opinions well before the formal decision is taken bythe Steering Group (and Institute Board for the SCT).
* Maintaining up-to-date information on all activities inside the sub-system either directly or through people to whom coordination has been delegated.
* Keeping the sub-system community informed on developments within the ID relevant to the execution of the sub-system.
* Ensuring a correct balance of responsibilities among the sub-system institutes.
* Keeping an updated project plan for the sub-system, including the use of resources (resource loaded project plan), and communicating it to the ID Project Leader.
* Representing the sub-system on the ID Steering Group.
* Organising sub-system working meetings and Steering Group meetings.
* Ensuring that clear work definitions are written for people to whom tasks are permanently delegated.
* Ensuring the efficiency of the sub-system execution.
* Ensuring that the sub-system status is regularly communicated to the ID Project Leader.
* Bringing the ID Project Leaders attention changes which could affect the rest of the ID or the ATLAS experiment.

The following areas remain under the direction of the ID Project Leader, but the SSPL is responsible for their execution within his/her sub-system according to the agreed overall plan:

* Definition of the ID layout and sub-system envelopes.
* Definition of the ID performance specifications, and simulation studies.
* Definition of the individual sub-system cost ceilings, within the ID budget agreed by the ATLAS CB.
* Any agreed common areas such as alignment.

In addition, the ID Project Leader retains overall responsibility for those areas delegated to the ID Project Engineer.

### Mandate of the Inner Detector Project Engineer

The ID Project Engineer (IDPE) is responsible for all mechanical engineering matters concerning the Inner Detector. In this task he or she is supported by the sub-system project engineers appointed by the sub-system PL's, and reports directly to the IDPL. He or she is invited to attend sub-system engineering meetings and reviews.

The IDPE is appointed without election by the ID Project Leader. His/her appointment must be approved by the IDSG and ID Institutes Board. The appointment is for two years, and may be renewed.

The responsibilities of the ID PE include:

* integration of the sub-systems within the ID.
* maintenance of an overall ID description in the form of a parameter book and associated geometry drawings.
* maintenance of an overall construction schedule for the ID compatible with the Technical Coordination Master Schedule.
* monitoring the sub-system schedules to ensure that they remain compatible with the overall ID schedule.
* the ID cooling systems.
* the ID overall support structure.

* the access scenario for the ID and its components, in conjunction with Technical Coordination.
* Overview of the service paths from the ID to the counting room and underground areas and layout of the ID surface buildings in conjunction with Technical Coordination
* Alerting the ID PL and the ATLAS and ID GLIMOS of any issues relating to the safety of personel and equipment.
* Ensuring that contact is maintained with the Technical Coordination team by regular attendance at the TC meetings.
* Ensuring the coherence of the sub-system engineering by chairing regular meetings with the sub-system project engineers.
* Informing the ID community of the engineering status by chairing an open meeting during ATLAS weeks.
