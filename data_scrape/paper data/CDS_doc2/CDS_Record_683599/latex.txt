ABSTRACT

The measurement of the light yield in the Argonne extended barrel module made in August 97 using neutral density filters indicates that it is substantially lower than was obtained in the final test module. We have estimated the light yield using electrons and the left-right photo-tube signals. This confirms the measurement of about 20 pe's/ GeV in tile 10 of the Argonne module, reported at the September Atlas week and gives the result that the light yield in the Barcelona module in this tile is about 30 pe's/GeV. We have conducted bench measurements on the component tiles and fiber profiles to help identify the source of this loss of light. For a small sample of tiles, the data show that for the Barcelona module two affects can mostly explain the loss of light: about half of the loss comes from loss of signal in the tiles and about half from the relatively lower reflectivity of the profiles. These two effects alone are not sufficient to explain the additional loss of light in the Argonne module.

**1. Introduction**

This analysis was prompted by the reports on light yield made at the September Atlas week and the need to compare the two extended barrel prototype modules. The technique used to extract the light yield in a tower follows that given in Tile Cal Note-66, where the technique is used for muons. The number of photo-electrons per tower can be obtained from the formula

\[N_{pe}=2\times\left[\frac{\mu(\frac{(L+R)}{2})}{\sigma(\frac{(L-R)}{2})} \right]^{2} \tag{1}\]

where L & R are the signals in the left and right phototubes respectively. The assumption being made is that the rms of the difference distribution represents the rms of the summed distribution from photostatistics in the case that noise can be neglected.

Bench measurements were made to study several potential factors using the Ruthenium source system described in TileCal Note-66. This system has beencalibrated using an LED to establish the absolute photo-electron yield for the penetrating beta from the decay of the source. Direct comparison was also made to the only two tiles remaining at Argonne from the 1995 test and also to the fit over the small ensemble of tiles done in 1995. Finally, some tests on the fiber profile were conducted to estimate effects from reflectivity and to establish that in principal aluminised mylar, glued to the profile would improve performance. These are also described.

## 2 Tower light yield measured from electrons

Several electron runs were taken in August 97, with the beam in the center of tiles 2,6 & 10 of both Argonne and Barcelona extended barrel modules. The measurement of the light yield using the separate phototubes is sensitive to the assumption of low noise in the readout and as a first step the data taken using the neutral density filters in the Argonne module was analysed and the results from the two techniques compared.

The basic analysis is as follows. Good electrons were selected for beam triggers (TRIG=1) with CHER\(>\)160 to reduce pion contamination, and \(\mathrm{abs}(y_{imp})\)\(<\)15.0 to restrict selection to events in the body of the beam spot. If any additional non-electron background appeared to be present, the TDC profile was inspected and a cut applied either on the tdc range or simply on the summed pulseheight. The "Left-Right" distribution is also sensitive to simple attenuation as a function of impact point and must be corrected. A linear correction was determined from a profile fit of Left-Right as a function of \(y_{imp}\). With this correction applied, all data in principal represent a common distribution whose rms represents the statistical fluctuations due to finite photostatistics (assuming all other contributions to be negligible).

Table 1 shows the results by tower and by attenuation factor of the neutral density filter. The mean signals are generally in good agreement with those that would be expected from the measured filter attenuation2. The estimated light yield is clearly more sensitive to the reliability of the signal rms for low signals. For example, if one assumes an electronic noise contribution of 100MeV equivalent per tube, then the estimate of the light yield may increase by as much as 50%. The measurement of 20-21 pe/GeV in Tiles 10 and 6 for ND=1 (i.e. no filter) is in agreement with the light yields reported at the September Atlas week showing that noise levels are sufficiently low for this method to be valid. In addition, except for the very smallest signals, the light yield predicted from the unattenuated signal and the attenuation of the ND filter is comparable to the light yield me assured indirectly from left and right phototubes.

Footnote 2: Data provided by R. Stanek

The analysis of the data taken with neutral density filters shows that the electronic noise levels are sufficiently low that the signals from left and right phototubes can be used to estimate the photo-electron yield per tower. We have therefore applied the method to the 100GeV data taken in the Barcelona module. The results are shown in Table 2. They show the same general reduction in light yield towards the inner tiles. However, for all three tiles, the characteristic light yield is about 40% more than observed in the Argonne module. This relative difference seems quite in agreement with the source current measurements reported at the September Atlas week and we conclude that the effect is real.

## 2 Tile light yield measured using ruthenium source

A small number of tiles from the 1997 production3 were tested using the Ruthenium source system at Argonne (one per size). The PMT/ADC calibration for this system was determined to be about 85 counts/pe, which is almost identical to that obtained in 1995 (the procedure is described in Note-66). Two fibers remaining from the extended barrel instrumentation were used to read out the tiles and were coupled to them using aluminised mylar, as was done for the 1995 tests. The fiber length chosen was that of the longest readout fiber: 204cm. In all cases the response at the center of the tile was made - typically three measurements were made and averaged. An incidental observation during these tests in which the fibers were repeatedly handled, is that the mirroring on the fiber end is quite resilient.

Since new readout fibers were used for the tests in 1997, the first task is to establish the relative calibration between the 1995 and 1997 data. Table 3 shows the measurements taken in 1995 compared to those taken in 1997. In addition, the prediction for the light yield from the fit to all tiles measured in 1995 is given where the predicted light yield is given by the equation:

\[I_{t}=22.0+1232.0\times\frac{L}{A_{t}} \tag{2}\]

where L is the length of readout fiber and A the tile area. The conclusion is that the relative light yield (1997/1995) is 0.89, independent of which way one chooses to look at the data. Since in 1995 a single loop of fiber was used for the readout of both tile edges, we assume that the switch to the final geometry is the principal cause for the absolute reduction in measured light from the 1995 tiles (it should be noted however, that this may still be a relevant affect on the light measured in the two extended barrel prototype modules.)

We now choose to compare the measured signal from the 1997 tiles to the fit prediction from 1995 (a way to, hopefully, maximise use of our rather limited component data). This is shown in Table 4. The average ratio measured/fit response is 0.71, which when corrected for the new fiber geometry implies that the 1997 tiles are giving 20% less light than those produced in 1995. A similar conclusion would be drawn in the direct comparison between tiles whose areas are similar to J3 and J5a.

**3. Fiber Coupling Effects**

The last experiment made in this series was to evaluate the effect of replacing the aluminised mylar coupling with a profile. Tile 6 from the 1997 production was used for this study (since it closely matches the dimensions of one of the 1995 test module tiles). A couple of random sections of profile were cut to the same length as a tile edge, carefully taped to the wrapping and the fibers inserted. This was repeated for two other coupling systems: using black tedlar to couple the fibers to the tile; and using two sections of profile to which some aluminised mylar had been glued to the inner (coupling) surface. The results are shown in Table 5.

The data indicate that the reflectivity of the standard profile is significantly lower than that of aluminised mylar. If it is possible to either aluminise the outer

(coupling) surface of the profile or to add a strip of aluminised mylar to it, then a light yield very close to our best achieved will be realisable. Quantitatively, the light loss in the extended barrels relative to the test modules is about 25% from this contribution. Some studies of the effect of the tightness of the fiber coupling to the tile and of additional fibers in the profile were also made. No large effects were observed, though the test were by no means exhaustive. During these tests, however, one tile was observed to have a very low light yield and this was eventually attributed to a poor fiber coupling. Such a contribution to the low observed light yield in the prototype modules cannot be ruled out.

## 6 Conclusions

Analysis of 90 degree electron data has been carried out to determine the tower light yield using the separate signals in the two phototubes. The light yield of tile 10 in the Argonne module is measured to be 19 pe/GeV, in good agreement with the preliminary result made using neutral density filters which was reported at the September Atlas week. The light yield from the corresponding tile in the Barcelona module is measured to be 30pe/GeV. Finally, the light yield from tiles 6 and 2 are systematically lower than those in tile 10. Bench tests of the optics components have been made using the Ruthenium source system at Argonne to try to identify causes of this low light yield relative to the final test module, in which a

value of about 65 pe/GeV was obtained. These show that the low light yield in the Barcelona module is mostly explainable by only two effects : 20losses) ; 25for the fiber-profile system to the tile. These alone are not sufficient to explain the even lower light yield seen in the Argonne module, nor the tile, radial, dependence seen in the data in both modules.
