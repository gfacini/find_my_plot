###### Abstract

The ATLAS Collaboration [1]This note gives an overview of the implementation and performance of the electron and photon selection by the ATLAS trigger system. Trigger menus for commissioning as well as for the first physics run are presented together with the strategy for the early data taking phase. The physics performance in terms of selection efficiency and background rejection has been estimated using Monte Carlo simulations for various luminosity scenarios. An example of a method to determine trigger efficiency from real data using \(Z\to ee\) events is discussed.

Introduction

This note gives an overview of the implementation and performance of the electron and photon selection by the ATLAS trigger system. Electron and photon trigger baseline signatures and menus for LHC commissioning and first physics run are presented. The principles that have determined their design are:

* Coverage of the physics needed for commissioning the trigger and detector systems as well as the offline reconstruction.
* Coverage of the physics channels that allow standard model studies and searches for new physics.
* Keeping the rates within the allowed bandwidth.

Events with electrons and photons in the final state are important signatures for many physics analyses envisaged at the LHC. A good selection by the electron/photon (e/\(\gamma\)) triggers will be important for many analyses from searches for new physics, such as the Higgs boson, SUSY, \(Z^{\prime}\) boson to standard model (SM) precision physics such as top quark and \(W\) boson mass measurement, rare \(B\) decays, etc. In the early running processes such as \(Z\to ee\), \(J/\psi\to ee\), \(W\to e\nu\) and \(\gamma\)-jet events will be crucial for the understanding of the detector. These decays are important benchmark channels for the calibration, alignment and monitoring of the detector performance. The e/\(\gamma\) trigger needs to cover the transverse energy range between a few GeV and several TeV. An overview of some relevant physics channels with electrons and photons in the final state, classified according to the corresponding transverse energy thresholds is given in Table 1.

To achieve this physics reach the trigger algorithms have to be optimized in terms of physics performance (signal efficiency, background rejection) and system performance (execution time, data requirements, etc). The trigger menu has to ensure a good selection of the above physics channels within the allocated rate for the various luminosities during LHC running.

In the following sections the implementation, performance and selection strategy are described in detail. Section 2 explains how e/\(\gamma\) candidates are reconstructed and selected at the different trigger levels. Section 3 presents the selection strategy for LHC start-up, describing the schema currently envisaged for: commissioning, first menu for an initial luminosity of L\(\sim\)10\({}^{31}\) cm\({}^{-2}\) s\({}^{-1}\) and the subsequent development towards higher luminosity scenarios. In Section 4 the performance of the various electron and photon triggers for a startup luminosity of L\(\sim\)10\({}^{31}\) cm\({}^{-2}\) s\({}^{-1}\) and a luminosity scenario of L\(\sim\)10\({}^{33}\) cm\({}^{-2}\) s

Table 1: Examples of some important processes requiring a good electron and photon trigger selection is discussed. Examples of trigger efficiencies for physics processes with electrons and photons in the final state over the transverse energy (\(E_{T}\)) spectrum from a few GeV up to several TeV are included. A discussion of the robustness of the trigger selection follows in Section 5. Section 6 explains how the trigger efficiency will be determined from real data using \(Z\to ee\) events.

## 2 Electron and photon trigger selection

In this section the electron and photon trigger reconstruction and selection are described. The reconstruction and selection variables for each of the trigger levels are summarized in separate subsections.

### L1 selection

At L1 trigger information from the electromagnetic (EM) and hadronic calorimeter system in the form of so-called trigger towers is used. A trigger tower has a dimension \(\Delta\eta\times\Delta\phi\sim 0.1\times 0.1\). In this region all the cells are summed over the full depth of either the electromagnetic or hadronic calorimeter. The L1 selection algorithm for electromagnetic clusters is based on a sliding \(4\times 4\) window of trigger towers which looks for local maxima [1].

The trigger object is considered to contain an electron or photon candidate if the following requirements are satisfied:

* The central \(2\times 2\) 'core' cluster consisting of both EM and hadronic towers is a local \(E_{T}\) maximum This requirement prevents double counting of clusters by overlapping windows.
* The most energetic of the four combinations of two neighbouring EM towers passes the electromagnetic cluster threshold.

Figure 1 shows the L1 trigger tower schema used to determine the L1 selection variables. Isolation requirements can be imposed if required to control the rate:

* \(E_{isol}^{EM}\): The total \(E_{T}\) in the 12 EM towers surrounding the \(2\times 2\) core cluster is less than the electromagnetic isolation threshold.
* \(E_{core}^{HAD}\): The total \(E_{T}\) in the 4 towers of the hadronic calorimeter behind the \(2\times 2\) core cluster of the electromagnetic calorimeter is less than the hadronic core threshold.

Figure 1: L1 calorimeter trigger schema, showing how trigger towers (each spanning a \(0.1\times 0.1\)\(\eta\times\phi\) region) are used to determine the energy for the electromagnetic cluster as well as for the electromagnetic isolation, hadronic core and hadronic isolation.

* \(E_{iso}^{HAD}\): The total \(E_{T}\) in the 12 towers surrounding the \(2\times 2\) core cluster in the hadronic calorimeter is less than the hadronic isolation threshold.

The distributions of these isolation variables for signal and background are shown in Fig. 2 from Monte Carlo simulations. For signal, single electrons with an \(E_{T}\) between 7 and 80 GeV with a flat distribution are used (solid line, hatched histogram). In comparison, background candidates from a simulated sample of QCD background (referred to as dijets) with \(E_{T}\)\(>\) 17 GeV are shown (dashed line, hollow histogram). Most of the samples discussed in this note, unless otherwise specified, use the Pythia 6.403 [2] Monte Carlo event generator. The ATLAS detector Monte Carlo simulation is based on GEANT4 [3]. The Monte Carlo simulations store details of the generated particles including the type and kinematic variables, this so-called _MC-Truth_ information can then be used as a control in subsequent analyses of the simulated data. In this case the truth information has been used to guarantee that no real electrons are included in the background distributions in Fig. 2. The distributions shown have been normalized to unit area. It can be seen that isolation, in particular L1 EM isolation, provides a good handle to reduce jet background rate, typically needed at low transverse energy thresholds. As isolation depends on the topology and energy distribution of the event, as well as on other parameters such as luminosity and beam conditions, isolation cuts need to be well understood and applied carefully during data taking.

### L2 selection

L2 is seeded by the L1 EM Region of Interest (RoI). Thus L2 receives the reconstructed L1 object with the \(\eta\) and \(\phi\) positions and the transverse energy thresholds passed. L2 accesses a subsample of the detector data around the given \(\eta\) and \(\phi\) position and applies trigger specific reconstruction algorithms characterized for their speed and robustness. Both photon and electron selection use the full granularity, full precision calorimeter information now available in the first selection step. The transverse cluster energy and various shower shape variables calculated in the different layers of the EM calorimeter are used to identify e/\(\gamma\) candidates. The electron selection uses in addition inner detector information. Tracks are reconstructed in the inner detector and matched to the calorimeter energy clusters. Thus track finding and track-cluster matching variables can be used to select electrons.

#### 2.2.1 Calorimeter based electron and photon selection

L2 calorimeter reconstruction is seeded by the \(\eta\) and \(\phi\) positions provided by L1. Calorimeter cells in a window of size \(\Delta\eta\times\Delta\phi=0.4\times 0.4\) are retrieved (for more details on the data preparation see [4]). At

Figure 2: L1 isolation variables for single electrons with an \(E_{T}\) between 7 and 80 GeV with a flat distribution (solid line, hatched histogram). In comparison, background candidates from the \(E_{T}\)\(>\) 17 GeV dijet sample are shown (dashed line, hollow histogram). For the background, only clusters that do not match to a true electron within a \(\Delta R\) cone of 0.1 are considered. The distributions for electromagnetic isolation (left), hadronic core energy (middle), and hadronic isolation (right) are shown.

the L2 trigger the cluster building algorithm scans the cells in the second layer of the EM calorimeter and searches for the cell with highest \(E_{T}\). Subsequently, a cluster of \(0.075\times 0.175\) in \(\eta\times\phi\) is built around this seed cell. The larger cluster size in \(\phi\) reduces the low-energy tails due to photon conversion and electron bremsstrahlung. Electrons and photons deposit nearly all of their energy in the EM calorimeter and deposit typically less than 1% of their energy into the hadronic calorimeter. In addition, showers from electrons and photons are typically smaller in the plane transverse to its direction than showers from jets. These quantities are used to select a low-background sample of electrons and photons.

In detail, the L2 electron and photon calorimeter algorithms select events base on the following quantities:

* Transverse energy of the EM cluster (\(E_{T}^{EM}\)): Due to the energy dependence of the jet cross-section, a cut on \(E_{T}^{EM}\) provides the best rejection against jet background for a given high \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) signal process.
* Transverse energy in the first layer of the hadronic calorimeter (\(E_{T}^{Had}\)): This is required to be below a given threshold. This cut is relaxed for high \(E_{T}\) triggers (90 GeV and above) as the leakage into the hadronic calorimeter increases with energy.
* Shower shape in \(\eta\) direction in the second EM sampling: The ratio of the energy deposit in \(3\times 7\) cells (corresponding to \(0.075\times 0.175\) in \(\Delta\eta\times\Delta\phi\)) over that in \(7\times 7\) cells is calculated: \(R_{core}=E_{3\times 7}/E_{7\times 7}\). Photons and electrons deposit most of their energy in \(3\times 7\) cells and thus the corresponding ratio is typically larger than 80 %.
* Search for a second maximum in the first EM sampling: After applying the cuts in the hadronic calorimeter and the second sampling of the EM calorimeter, only jets with very little hadronic activity and narrow showers in the calorimeter remain. The fine granularity in rapidity in the first sampling of the EM calorimeter allows checks to be made for substructures within a shower for a further rejection of background such as single or multiple \(\pi^{0}\)s or \(\eta\)s decaying to photons. The energy deposit in a window \(\Delta\eta\times\Delta\phi=0.125\times 0.2\) is examined. The shower is scanned for local maxima in the \(\eta\)-direction. The ratio of the difference between the energy deposited in the bin with highest energy \(E_{1st}\) and the energy deposited in the bin with second highest energy \(E_{2nd}\) divided by the sum of these two energies is calculated: \(R_{strips}=(E_{1st}-E_{2nd})/(E_{1st}+E_{2nd})\). This ratio tends to one for isolated electrons and photons, and tends to zero for photons coming for example from \(\pi^{0}\) decay.

Figure 3 shows typical distributions of the above shower shape variables for a signal sample of Higgs decaying into \(\gamma\gamma\) and a the dijet background sample. A clear rejection power against background of the \(E_{T}\) is seen for a cut above 20 GeV. The shower shape variables in the first and second EM sampling of the calorimeter provide a good discrimination power above 0.8. These shower shape variables will have a narrower distribution for photons compared to electrons. The high granularity of the first EM sampling of the ATLAS detector permits efficient photon identification using only calorimeter information, tracking information is not used at all in the selection.

#### 2.2.2 Inner detector electron selection

If all the criteria of the calorimeter based electron selection are fulfilled, a search for tracks is performed in front of the cluster, electron trigger candidates are identified by the presence of a matching reconstructed tracks [5].

#### 2.2.3 Combined calorimeter and inner detector based electron selection

A further rate reduction, while maintaining a high electron efficiency, can be achieved by combining the calorimeter and inner detector information. The background rate can be reduced by cutting on \(\eta\) and \(\phi\) between the EM cluster and the extrapolated track into the calorimeter. As shown in Fig. 4 these distributions are narrower for electrons than for jets. Another quantity useful for electron selection is the ratio of the cluster \(E_{T}\) and the track \(p_{\rm T}\). This quantity is affected by bremsstrahlung effects which cause a tail in the \(E_{T}/p_{T}\) distribution towards high values (see Fig. 4), so it is not intended to use an upper cut on \(E_{T}/p_{T}\) in the early data-taking.

### EF selection

At the EF trigger level offline reconstruction algorithms and tools are used as much as possible. An important difference, however, between the offline and the EF reconstruction is that the offline reconstruction is run once per event accessing the whole detector, while the EF uses a seeded approach; runs several times per event, once for each RoI given by L2, accessing only the corresponding subsample of the detector.

Figure 3: Selection variables for a L2 calorimeter energy cluster. The distributions are shown for signal candidates from a simulated \(H\to\gamma\gamma\) sample (dashed line) and for dijet background candidates that do not have a photon or electron matched within a \(\Delta R\) cone of 0.1 and that have at least 1 jet with \(E_{T}\)\(>\) 17 (black solid line). Both distributions have been normalized to unity. The plots show the transverse energy of the EM cluster (top left), transverse energy deposited in the first layer of the hadronic calorimeter (top right), shower shape in the \(\eta\) direction in the second EM sampling (\(R_{core}\)) (bottom left), and the search for a second maximum in the first electromagnetic sampling (\(R_{strips}\)) (bottom right).

Currently, in the photon trigger selection only calorimeter information is used. EM clusters are searched for and reconstructed in RoIs of size \(\Delta\eta\times\Delta\phi=0.4\times 0.4\). The EF calorimeter clustering algorithm searches for a local energy maximum with calorimeter trigger tower granularity. For electron and photon reconstruction only the data from the EM calorimeter is used, in contrast with L2 where the hadronic energy is also computed. The clusters should have an \(E_{T}\) above a given threshold. The default cluster size used is \(0.125\times 0.125\) in \(\eta\times\phi\) (whilst the offline reconstruction algorithms perform clustering with different window sizes, a single clustering option is used in the EF ). Once found by the clustering algorithm the cluster parameters (position, energy, etc.) are computed and further refined by a set of cluster correction (position and energy calibration) tools [5]. Also, corrections for the transition region between barrel and end-cap calorimeters are possible using the information from a set of scintillators.

For electron triggers, tracks are subsequently reconstructed in the inner detector. The EF tracking currently implements an inside-out track reconstruction (track finding starts from the inner silicon detectors and then is extended to the transition radiation tracker). In the future, an outside-in approach is intended to be used in the trigger in cases where photon conversions are present. There is the possibility to attempt bremsstrahlung recovery using offline tools. This option is not foreseen to run in the electron triggers for start-up but might be applied when running at higher luminosities with tighter selections. At L\(\sim\)10\({}^{31}\) cm\({}^{-2}\) s\({}^{-1}\) bremsstrahlung effects do not affect the trigger efficiency since the selection cuts are sufficiently loose to be insensitive to the performance improvements.

Electron and photon identification in the EF is very similar to the offline [6]. Calorimeter shower shapes, leakage into the hadronic calorimeter and the \(E_{T}\) of the EM cluster are used for the calorimeter based selection for electrons and photons. Compared to L2 more shower shape variables are used. Together with improved calibrations this results in a further rate reduction. For electrons track-cluster

Figure 4: L2 (top) and EF (bottom) electron selection variables based on the combined calorimeter and inner detector information. From left to right the following distributions are shown: the difference in \(\eta\) (left) and \(\phi\) (middle) between the cluster and track (extrapolated to calorimeter) position. and are shown: ratio of the \(E_{T}\) of the EM cluster and the \(p_{\rm T}\) of the reconstructed tracks (right). Distributions are shown for signal (solid line, hatched histogram) and background (dashed line, hollow histogram). The reconstructed electrons come from a \(7<E_{T}<80\) GeV sample. The background candidates come from a filtered dijet simulated sample, only candidates with no match to a truth electron within a \(\Delta R\) cone of 0.1 rad are selected.

matching variables, track quality cuts, transverse impact parameter and for high luminosity running potentially transition radiation information could be used to further reduce the rate.

As an example a loose electron EF selection will use the following selections: longitudinal leakage, shower shapes in the middle layer of the EM calorimeter, and very loose track-cluster matching cuts. Tighter selections might also use the shower shapes in the first EM calorimeter layer, information on the transverse impact parameter and on the track quality (number of hits in the pixels and strip silicon detectors and number of hits in the first pixel layer). Distributions for the track-cluster matching variables at EF are shown in Fig. 4. The distributions are very similar to those of the L2 track-cluster matching, but more refined algorithms are available at this stage, with more up-to-date calibration and alignment information.

## 3 Electron and photon trigger selection strategy

In this section the foreseen trigger selection strategy from the start-up phase up to physics running at nominal low luminosity is discussed. First the various commissioning steps at start-up are explained. This is followed by a discussion of a possible electron and photon trigger menu for the first physics run assuming a luminosity of L\(\sim\)10\({}^{31}\) cm\({}^{-2}\) s\({}^{-1}\).

When LHC turns on the trigger menus will need to provide data for commissioning and for analysis. In these paragraphs analysis is used to mean standard model measurements and searches for new physics. Typically these two objectives require very different trigger selection criteria. Commissioning usually demands loose selections to allow for more basic understanding of the detector and trigger, but loose selections accept more background events. Analysis is favoured with tight trigger selections that maximize the signal to background ratio in the allocated bandwidth. At start-up commissioning tasks would be prioritized, though signatures that provide data for a physics analysis will be included in the menu whenever possible. Following the progress on commissioning, loose trigger selections will be substituted by tighter ones that increase the analysis capabilities. The main challenge for the ATLAS trigger is the big difference (approximately six orders of magnitude) between the collision rate and the rate at which data can be stored. This imposes tight constraints on the trigger menus.

These principles used to determine the trigger menus, are developed in more detail in the following subsections, which also include early trigger menu tables.

The naming conventions for the various e/\(\gamma\) triggers used in the following sections are as follows. The name for L1 electromagnetic candidates is EM. This is followed by the \(E_{T}\) threshold applied for this triggers and if isolation criteria are applied an "i" is added at the end of the name. The number preceding EM indicates the object multiplicity. For example 2EM13I requires that at least two isolated electron or photon candidates are identified at L1 passing a \(E_{T}=13\) GeV threshold. The naming conventions for L2 and EF are very similar. For example 2\(\gamma\)17i denotes a trigger which selects events in which two isolated photons are found passing a \(E_{T}\) threshold cut of 17 GeV at EF level. Similarly a possible e20_xe15 trigger selects events in which at least one electron candidate with \(E_{T}\)\((EF)>20\) GeV is identified, in addition, the missing transverse energy at EF exceeds 15 GeV.

### Commissioning

At LHC start-up an initial luminosity of L\(\sim\)10\({}^{31}\) cm\({}^{-2}\) s\({}^{-1}\) is expected. This will allow lower \(E_{T}\) thresholds compared to those at the nominal LHC luminosity. The start-up menu has to provide the data samples needed to commission the trigger and detectors and at the same time provide useful data to be used for physics analysis. Therefore, the trigger has to guarantee the selection of the following standard model channels: \(W\to e\nu\), \(J/\psi\to ee,\Upsilon\to ee\), Drell-Yan, and direct photon production. For example:\(Z\to ee\), \(J/\psi\to ee\) and \(\Upsilon\to ee\) will provide input for the electromagnetic calibration, alignment, efficiency measurements, etc. Electrons from bottom and charm quark decays will be useful for studies of \(E/p\). Direct photon production will provide input for the jet calibrations using \(\gamma\)-jet events where the photon and jet are back-to-back. For comparison, in the first 100 pb\({}^{-1}\) of data we expect 235k of \(J/\psi\to ee\), 40k of \(\Upsilon\to ee\), 10k of Drell-Yan events, 10M \(b,c\to e\), 100k direct photons and 250k of \(W\to e\nu\).

The strategy is to apply L1 selections and run the High-Level Trigger (HLT) in pass-through mode (the selection criteria are tested and the trigger decision is recorded but no event is rejected). Table 2 shows the e\(\gamma\) triggers foreseen. This will provide the first data samples for the low and high-\(p_{\rm T}\) spectrum and the rates for the various e/\(\gamma\) triggers. Fig. 5 shows the expected L1 e/\(\gamma\) rate for a luminosity of L\(\sim\)10\({}^{31}\) cm\({}^{-2}\) s\({}^{-1}\) with and without isolation criteria applied as a function of the transverse energy threshold.

This will provide the input, based on real data, to devise a trigger menu best suited for the first commissioning and physics run with HLT selection enabled. Note that current rate estimates are affected by an uncertainty factor of two or three coming from the theoretical uncertainties in the jet cross-section. Though the L1 pass-through triggers will mainly select background events they are useful samples and can be used to look for clusters and tracks in the whole \(\eta-\phi\) space and check that known dead and noisy channels and/or disconnected regions are correctly flagged. In addition the distributions of the e/\(\gamma\) selection variables from data can be compared to those from Monte Carlo simulations. For example, signal over background distributions will be studied for variables with good discrimination power (e.g. Rcore). L2 and EF performance can be checked and studies undertaken to evaluate the tracking performance of the different L2 tracking algorithms.

In the next phase of the commissioning the HLT selection will be progressively enabled. Several monitoring triggers will be kept, though with increased prescale factors applied. For example, L2 and EF in pass-through mode or loose \(\gamma\) triggers (to monitor tighter calorimeter cuts as well as tracking efficiency for the electron triggers).

### First physics run

After the commissioning phase of the detector the first physics run is foreseen. At the physics run, each of the trigger menu signatures including the HLT will be enabled as soon as the understanding of the detector and trigger allow. Table 3 gives an overview of the main electron and photon physics triggers. The aim is to select events with at least one electron above \(\sim 10\) GeV or one photon above \(\sim 20\) GeV, in addition to the relevant double object triggers, e.g. for selecting \(J/\psi\), \(\Upsilon\), and Z events. \(J/\psi\to ee\) and \(\Upsilon\to ee\) events are particularly demanding events for the trigger system. The trigger rates errors for each trigger menu are statistical. Due to their relatively low masses, the electrons produced in the \(J/\psi\) and \(\Upsilon\) decays are very soft (with an average transverse momenta of less that 5 GeV). This poses a huge challenge to the L1 calorimeter trigger. Its performance at the low-energy end is limited by the noise of typically 0.5 GeV per RoI. A 3 GeV threshold is the limit for the L1 trigger. The 6.5 kHz L1 output rate for 2e5 makes it one of the biggest consumers of the total bandwidth.

To keep the rate at an acceptable level selections for the electron triggers at low-\(p_{\rm T}\) (e.g. 2e5) have to apply tighter HLT selections compared to the higher-\(p_{\rm T}\) triggers. A prescaled e5 trigger will allow measurement of the efficiencies and optimization of the selection cuts. A range of signatures is foreseen

## 4 Electron and photon trigger physics performance

In this section the performance of the different signatures is presented with trigger efficiency plots as a function of transverse energy \(E_{T}\) and pseudo-rapidity \(\eta\).

The trigger efficiency optimization of a given electron/photon trigger menu is a compromise between several factors: trigger efficiency for signal, QCD background rate which depends on the luminosity (constrained by allowed HLT bandwidth) and constrains of the average execution time at each trigger level. The performance of the main electron and photons triggers has been evaluated for a start-up luminosity of L\(\sim\)10\({}^{31}\) cm\({}^{-2}\) s\({}^{-1}\)and for a higher luminosity of L\(\sim\)10\({}^{33}\) cm\({}^{-2}\) s\({}^{-1}\). In sections 4.2 and 4.3 the performance of these triggers is discussed for electrons and photons respectively. For these studies two types of events have been used, the so called ideal and the misaligned detector geometry. The misaligned detector geometry simulation contains expected distortions of the detector and in addition contains extra material coming from a more accurate description of cooling, powering and cabling services. This increases significantly the amount of material in the region \(1.4<|\eta|<1.8\) compared to the ideal geometry, thus affecting the calorimeter energy calibration which was extracted using the ideal geometry. In section 4.2 a comparison is given for the performance based on these two layouts for one of the electron triggers.

### Data Samples

The signal samples used for electron and photon trigger performance studies in this note are summarized in Table 8. For the electron and photon trigger optimization and turn-on curves samples with an energy range of \(7<E_{T}<80\) GeV (flat energy spectrum) are used.

Background samples and their expected cross-sections are summarized in Table 9. The minimum bias Monte Carlo sample corresponds to our best knowledge of the inclusive expected backgrounds (including both hard and soft processes). Unfortunately most of the events in it are at low energies \(<7\)

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|} \hline Physics & \(E_{T}\)(GeV) & Geometry \\ \hline \hline single photons & 60 & misaligned \\ single photon scan & 7-80 & misaligned–ideal \\ single photons & 20 & misaligned \\ single electrons & 25 & misaligned \\ single electron scan & 7-80 & misaligned–ideal \\ Z\(\to ee\) & – & misaligned–ideal \\ direct \(J/Psi\) & – & misaligned \\ H\(\rightarrow\gamma\gamma\) & 120 & misaligned \\ W\(\to eV\) & & misaligned \\ G\(\to ee\) & 500 & misaligned \\ Z\({}^{\prime}\to ee\) & 1000 & misaligned \\ G\(\rightarrow\gamma\gamma\) & 500 & misaligned \\ Photon+Jet1 & 17-35 & misaligned \\ Photon+Jet2 & 35-70 & misaligned \\ Photon+Jet3 & 70-140 & misaligned \\ Photon+Jet4 & 140-280 & misaligned \\ Photon+Jet5 & 280-560 & misaligned \\ Photon+Jet6 & 560-1120 & misaligned \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 8: Main electron/photon signal and physics samples.

is not very practical for high-statistics studies above this energy. To increase our efficiency for the events with electrons and photons we use a filter which is based on the combination of the EM cluster \(E_{T}\) cut and the area of the EM cluster. Two types of the filter, "default" and "loose" are used to check for the potential biases in the L1 trigger rate which could occur if the area required by the filter is too small or the \(E_{T}\) cut too high for the trigger threshold studied.

For the trigger rate studies in the intermediate energy range \(6-17\) GeV we use minimum bias events with a transverse energy above 6 GeV and default filter (a rejection factor of 16.61). Above 17 GeV the dijet processes become the most prominent background for electrons and photons. Dijet samples with a threshold cut of 15 GeV and different level of filters (default and loose respectively) are used to provide background estimates in that area (the physics processes such as W, Z, direct photons have been added). For the very high energy studies dijet samples with a threshold cut of 35 GeV are used.

For this note two detector geometries are used:

* "ideal" which uses the detector geometry to our best knowledge.
* "misaligned" where the detector has misalignments and material distortions.

The misaligned detector geometry has been generated to test the robustness of our reconstruction and trigger algorithms with respect to incorrect alignment and calibration of the detector due to unexpected excess of material. Extra material was added in the misaligned detector geometry with respect to the ideal:

* For the inner detector, extra thin layers of material were added in the azimuthal angle range of \(0<\phi<\pi\) only. The amount of material added varies in the \(z\) direction, from a few percent of \(X_{0}\) on the active detector elements up to 1 \(X_{0}\) in the areas occupied by services.
* For the electromagnetic calorimeter, more material was added in the barrel cryostat (\(\sim 8-11\%\) of \(X_{0}\)), between the barrel presampler and first calorimeter sampling (\(\sim 5\%\)\(X_{0}\), always for positive \(\phi\)), and in the gap between the barrel and endcap cryostats (factor 1.7 increase of material density).

### Electron trigger performance

The performance of the electron trigger has been evaluated for the trigger menus foreseen for the luminosity expected at early running L\(\sim\)10\({}^{31}\) cm\({}^{-2}\) s\({}^{-1}\) and for a higher luminosity of L\(\sim\)10\({}^{33}\) cm\({}^{-2}\) s\({}^{-1}\). The trigger efficiencies are quoted with respect to electrons identified with offline particle identification cuts [6]. The trigger efficiencies have been evaluated using simulated single electron samples with a transverse energy spectrum of \(7<E_{T}\ <80\) GeV and other physics samples such as \(J/\psi\to ee\), \(Z\to ee\), etc. Rates have been estimated using simulated dijet events or minimum bias background depending on the trigger thresholds.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|} \hline \(p_{T}\)(hard) & jet filter & \(\sigma\) after filtering \\ \hline \hline
6GeV & default & 4.214 mb \\
7GeV & loose & 6.531 mb \\
7GeV & default & 3.788 mb \\
17GeV & loose & 0.373 mb \\
17GeV & default & 0.191 mb \\
35GeV & loose & 0.039 mb \\
35GeV & default & 0.021 mb \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 9: Main background samples and their cross sections.

In the following the performance for the start-up trigger items e5, e10, e20, e105 and for a possible e22i trigger for higher luminosity running are discussed.

Figure 6 shows the efficiencies as a function of \(E_{T}\) and \(|\eta|\) of the low-\(p_{\rm T}\) e5 trigger for the three trigger levels L1, L2 and EF. The e5 trigger menu is a trigger with prescale factor at L\(\sim\)10\({}^{31}\) cm\({}^{-2}\) s\({}^{-1}\)and the main trigger is the 2e5 trigger, which applies the same selection cuts. The efficiencies are obtained for electrons from a misaligned detector geometry \(J/\psi\to ee\) sample. In the offline analysis these electrons typically will be identified via the "medium set" of offline "soft-electron" selection cuts (see [7] for more details). Therefore, the efficiencies shown in Fig. 6 are normalized with respect to such an offline selection. As seen in the right figure, the efficiencies drop significantly in the transition region between the barrel and end-cap calorimeter. A better optimization of the trigger selection cuts in this region might help to recover part of the inefficiencies. Figure 6 shows L1, L2 and EF efficiencies as a function of \(E_{T}\) and of \(|\eta|\) of the e10 trigger, which is the lowest \(p_{\rm T}\) unprescaled single electron trigger foreseen for running at L\(\sim\)10\({}^{31}\) cm\({}^{-2}\) s\({}^{-1}\). The e10 trigger selects events with at least one good electron candidate with \(E_{T}>10\) GeV. The efficiencies are obtained for single electrons using ideal detector geometry and are normalized with respect to the medium set of offline electron cuts as discussed in Section 2.3. The efficiency reaches a plateau value for \(E_{T}\) approximately above 15 GeV and is quite uniform as a function of \(|\eta|\), except for a \(10-20\%\) dip in the transition region between the barrel and end-cap calorimeters. In Fig. 7 e10 trigger efficiencies are compared for samples that use ideal and misaligned detector simulation. The biggest effects are observed at lower \(E_{T}\) for the turn-on curve (left) and in the region \(1.4<|\eta|<1.8\) (right) where a significant increase of material in the so-called misaligned geometry with respect to the ideal one was introduced. Trigger efficiency plots as a function of \(E_{T}\) and \(|\eta|\) for the electron triggers e20 and e105 are shown in Fig. 6. Compared to the e10 trigger signature, the e20 trigger applies looser electron identification cuts. The e105 trigger is aimed at selecting very high \(p_{\rm T}\) electrons with very loose selection cuts for L\(\sim\)10\({}^{32}\) cm\({}^{-2}\) s\({}^{-1}\). At L\(\sim\)10\({}^{31}\) cm\({}^{-2}\) s\({}^{-1}\)this trigger will only apply the L1 selection.

For several physics channels a global trigger efficiency with respect to the offline loose selection is shown in Table 10 for each trigger level. An average trigger efficiency of \(\sim 98\%\) is obtained after the EF level trigger. An efficiency close to 100% is expected for very high \(p_{\rm T}\) electrons, therefore the selection has been optimized towards this goal.

Figure 8 (left) shows L1, L2 and EF efficiencies as a function of \(E_{T}\) of the signature e22i, the menu item selecting an electron with \(E_{T}>22\) GeV. The efficiencies are obtained for single electrons using ideal detector geometry are normalized with respect to a loose set of offline electron cuts as discussed in [6]. The efficiency reaches a plateau value for \(E_{T}\) approximately above 25 GeV.

Figure 8 (right) shows an example of trigger efficiency dependency on the offline electron identification cuts. Trigger efficiency has been determined with respect to loose, medium and tight offline electron identification selections as described in [6] for e15i. This menu item applies medium electron identification cuts at EF, therefore its efficiency with respect to loose offline reconstructed electrons is significantly lower than with respect to medium or tight offline electrons.

### Photon trigger performance

The physics performance of the photon trigger menus presented in Section 3 has been evaluated for early running at L\(\sim\)10\({}^{31}\) cm\({}^{-2}\) s\({}^{-1}\)and for a luminosity of L\(\sim\)10\({}^{33}\) cm\({}^{-2}\) s\({}^{-1}\). The performance has been evaluated in terms of trigger efficiency after each trigger level using simulated single photons with transverse energies between 7 and 80 GeV. Rate estimates were calculated using dijet background simulations.

A \(\gamma\)20 trigger with loose selection has been defined for the first physics run at L\(\sim\)10\({}^{31}\) cm\({}^{-2}\) s\({}^{-1}\). At this stage the selections still need to be understood and the photon trigger is also used to check the tracking part of the electron selection. Therefore, the same calorimeter selection cuts are used as for electrons.

Figure 6: Trigger efficiencies at L1 (solid circles), L2 (open squares) and EF (solid triangles) as a function of true electron \(E_{T}\) (left) and \(|\eta|\) (right) for the e5 (top), e10 (second from top), e20 (third from top) e105 (bottom) menu items. The efficiencies are obtained from the following Monte Carlo simulated samples: \(J/\psi\to ee\) decays simulated with misaligned detector geometry for e5 trigger item, \(Z^{\prime}\to ee\) (1TeV) for e105 and single electrons simulated with ideal detector geometry for e10 and e20. Trigger efficiencies are normalized with respect to the medium set of offline soft-electron cuts for e5, with respect to the medium set of offline electron cuts for e10 and with respect to the loose set of offline electron cuts for e20 and e105. For trigger efficiency versus \(|\eta|\) plots, an \(E_{T}\) cut according to the corresponding menu item has been applied: for e5 \(E_{T}>10\) GeV, for e10 \(E_{T}>15\) GeV, for e20 \(E_{T}>30\) GeV and for e105 \(E_{T}>130\) GeV. For e5 trigger item no data is shown for electrons for \(|\eta|>2\) as this is beyond the coverage of the transition radiation tracker whose information is used for the offline electron selection. Errors are statistical only.

Figure 9 (top right) shows the relative rate for each trigger level as a function of \(|\eta|\). Photons in the transition region between barrel and end-cap calorimeters (\(1.37<|\eta|<1.52\)) are not well measured and are excluded in the physics analysis.

The single photon trigger at L\(\sim\)10\({}^{33}\) cm\({}^{-2}\) s\({}^{-1}\) selects photons above \(E_{T}=\)55 GeV. To keep the rate under control, this trigger has to apply very tight L2 and EF calorimeter selections.

Figure 9 shows the trigger efficiencies as a function of \(E_{T}\) and \(|\eta|\) for the \(\gamma\)55 trigger using single photons. Only photons with \(|\eta|<1.37\) or \(1.52<|\eta|<2.45\) are considered. With respect to loosely selected offline photons the \(\gamma\)55 trigger is 95.5% efficient.

The double object trigger \(2\gamma 17i\) is another of the main photon triggers for running at L\(\sim\)10\({}^{33}\) cm\({}^{-2}\) s\({}^{-1}\). Since the single photon dataset only contains one photon per event, the \(2\gamma 17i\) trigger efficiency was estimated as the square of the single photon trigger efficiency (Eff\({}_{2\gamma 17i}\)= Eff\({}^{2}_{7\gamma 17i}\)). The overall trigger efficiency estimated from this sample is \(93.9\pm 0.2\)%.

Figure 8: Trigger efficiencies at L1, L2 and EF as a function of true electron \(E_{T}\) for the e22i menu item (left). The efficiencies are obtained for single electrons using ideal detector geometry and are normalized with respect to loose set of offline electron cuts. Trigger efficiency dependency on the offline electron identification (right). Trigger efficiency for the e15i signature is determined with respect to loose, medium and tight offline electron identification selection (described in [6]). Errors are statistical only.

Figure 7: Ratio of trigger efficiencies for single electrons reconstruction in misaligned and ideal detector geometry as a function of true electron \(E_{T}\) (left) and \(|\eta|\) (right) for the e10 menu item. Events in the \(|\eta|\) plot are required to verify \(E_{T}>15\) GeV. Errors are statistical only.

Figure 9 shows the \(\gamma\) 17i turn-on curve and efficiency as a function of \(|\eta|\) using single photon events. The trigger efficiencies shown for the turn-on are normalized with respect to tight offline photon selection criteria. In addition, the photons are required to be within the region \(|\eta|<1.37\) or \(1.52<|\eta|<2.45\). This plot shows that the \(\gamma\)17i trigger is well set up and is fully efficient at 25 GeV.

The photon trigger performance has been studied not only for single photon samples but also for several physics channels. Table 11 shows a summary of photon trigger efficiencies for simulated samples of standard model direct photon decays, Higgs decaying into two photons (low mass range 120 GeV) and an exotic signature: graviton decaying into a pair of photons G\(\rightarrow\gamma\gamma\) (500 GeV).

Trigger efficiencies after each level are given. Efficiencies are determined with respect to a loose offline selection using the main physics trigger for a given luminosity to select these events. In the case of \(H\rightarrow\gamma\gamma\) standard kinematical cuts are also applied. A more detailed study of trigger efficiencies for different physics channels can be found in [8] and [9].

## 5 Trigger robustness studies

The electron/photon HLT selection must be robust against detector effects such as mis-calibration, misalignment, dead and noisy read-out cells or sectors, luminosity and beam conditions changes etc. This will be especially important during early running. Depending on the bunch structure of the LHC, the effect of pile-up might already be important even at a luminosity of L\(\sim\)10\({}^{32}\) cm\({}^{-2}\) s\({}^{-1}\). More than one proton-proton interaction might occur per bunch crossing, the proton-proton interactions that are not interesting for analysis but happen in the same bunch crossing that the interesting one are typically denoted as 'pile-up'. At L\(\sim\)2\(\times\)10\({}^{33}\) cm\({}^{-2}\) s\({}^{-1}\) around 4.6 minimum bias events are expected per bunch crossing. In this section only the effects of pile-up and mis-calibrations due to additional detector material in front of the calorimeter are discussed.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|l l l|} \hline Dataset (geometry) & Trigger Level & Trigger efficiency (\%) \\ \hline \hline \(W\to e\nu\) (misaligned) & L1 & \(98.2\pm 0.1\) \\ (e20) & L1 + L2 & \(96.0\pm 0.2\) \\  & L1 + L2 + EF & \(94.3\pm 0.2\) \\ \hline \(Z^{\prime}\to ee\) (misaligned) & L1 & \(99.7^{+0.3}_{-0.7}\) \\ (e105) & L1 + L2 & \(98.9\pm 0.7\) \\  & L1 + L2 + EF & \(98.8\pm 0.7\) \\ \hline electrons 500 GeV (misaligned) & L1 & \(99.1\pm 0.6\) \\ (e105) & L1 + L2 & \(97.6\pm 0.5\) \\  & L1 + L2 + EF & \(97.5\pm 0.5\) \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 10: Global trigger efficiencies for the trigger items e20 and e105. The signal efficiencies are determined from several different signal samples: \(W\to e\nu\)\(Z^{\prime}\to ee\) and a sample of single electrons of fixed transverse energy of 500 GeV. The simulation used misaligned detector geometry. Trigger efficiencies are determined with respect to loose offline electron selection. In the \(W\to e\nu\) case the offline reconstructed electron is required to be within the \(|\eta|<2.5\) region and to have a transverse energy above 25 GeV. Efficiencies for the e105 item are determined in the kinematic region \(|\eta|<2.5\), the transition region between barrel and end-cap calorimeters removed (\(1.37<|\eta|<1.52\)), and with a minimum true transverse energy of 130 GeV.

### Effect of pile-up

The robustness of several electron triggers was studied with simulated data which included overlapping events ("pile-up") for a luminosity L\(\sim\)2\(\times\) 10\({}^{33}\) cm\({}^{-2}\) s\({}^{-1}\). The presence of pile-up might have effects in

The efficiencies are obtained for single photons simulated with ideal detector geometry and are normalized with respect to the loose set of offline photon cuts. Note, the \(|\eta|\) plot includes an additional cut of \(E_{T}\ >\) 23 GeV.

reconstruction efficiency, (mostly for tracks but also for calorimeter energy clusters), as well as in the identification of isolated electrons and photons, both at the trigger and offline reconstruction level.

Table 12 shows the effect of pile-up on the e12i and e22i trigger for single electron events. As can be seen the effect of pile-up on the trigger efficiency at L\(\sim\)2\(\times\) 10\({}^{33}\) cm\({}^{-2}\) s\({}^{-1}\) is \(\sim 3\%\). There is a \(\sim 2\%\) effect due to the isolation criteria at L1 when tight isolation cuts are applied (e12i) and a \(\sim 1\%\) loss at the HLT level. This results show that the trigger efficiency is only slightly more affected by pile-up effects than offline electron reconstruction. The effect of pile-up on trigger performance determined with respect to _MC-Truth_ electrons as well as on the background rate is being studied.

### Effect of additional detector material

A simulated data sample consisting of single electrons as described above was used to study the effect of additional inactive material in the detector. Despite the efforts to accurately describe the detector in Monte Carlo simulation it is not expected to be perfect. The biggest and more problematic differences between simulation and reality are expected to come from the description of inactive material (for example pipes for cooling, power and signal cables, etc). Trigger robustness against those possible distortions has to be tested. Methods to identify and correct those effects have to be developed. The detector simulation used to produce this data sample included distorted material distributions in both the inner detector volume and the electromagnetic calorimeter.

A detailed description of the material added in the Monte Carlo sample is given in Section 4.1 The amount of extra material with respect to the non-distorted simulation, grows from a few percent of a radiation length at \(\eta=0\) up to \(\sim 1X_{0}\) at \(1.5<|\eta|<1.8\), and then decreases towards higher values of \(|\eta|\). The amount of material added in front of the active elements was larger than the uncertainty on the

The effect of the extra inactive material on the electron trigger was studied by comparing the trigger efficiency for \(\phi>0\), where extra material was added in the detector simulation, and for \(\phi<0\), where no extra material was added. The resulting efficiencies are shown in Fig. 10. The efficiency is plotted as a function of the kinematic variables of the electron candidate reconstructed offline. A loose offline electron selection was used for normalization.

It can be seen that the effect of the added material is more pronounced for the e15i signature than for e10. The e15i signature applies tighter selection cuts than the e10. In particular e15i requires the so-called medium electron identification cuts in EF, this explains the lower trigger efficiency for e15i. If trigger efficiency was computed with respect to medium or tight offline electron identification selection, the trigger efficiency would be higher, as shown in Fig. 8.

## 6 Trigger efficiency determination from real data

The trigger efficiency will need to be determined from data, reducing the dependence on Monte Carlo simulation as much as possible. Before data-taking starts some of the methods to study the trigger performance without relying on the _MC-Truth_ information are being developed, an example is given in this section.

The so-called "tag and probe" method has been studied using a Monte Carlo simulation sample of \(Z\to ee\). In the first subsection the basis of this method is explained, followed by the detailed explanation of the selection criteria chosen for this study, the trigger efficiency computation and its comparison with _MC-Truth_ information. In the following subsection the performance of the method is presented for some loose trigger selections that will be used in early running.

### Efficiency extraction method

The so-called "tag and probe" method uses offline identification of \(Z\to ee\) decays to select a clean sample of electrons, which are then used to determine the electron trigger efficiency. During data-taking a data sample to perform an analysis will be characterized by a given trigger signature being satisfied.

Figure 10: Effect of additional inactive material in the detector on the electron trigger efficiency. The trigger efficiency is compared for the nominal material distribution (at \(\phi<0\)) and for increased inactive material (at \(\phi>0\)) for the electron triggers e10 and e15i. The efficiency is plotted as a function of \(|\eta|\) (left) and \(E_{T}\) (right) of the electron candidate reconstructed offline. The left histograms correspond to the e15i trigger only. Errors are statistical only.

In the study summarized in this section the data sample is defined by a given single electron trigger signature. The electron candidate that has satisfied the trigger is reconstructed and identified offline, it is the so-called "tag" electron. \(Z\to ee\) decays are selected requiring a second electron to be identified offline together with some identification conditions on the \(Z\) particle. This second electron is the so-called "probe" and it is used to study the trigger performance, since it is know to be a "good electron" it can be used to verify if electron trigger selection cuts are efficient to identify electrons.

The discrimination criteria applied to identify offline the tag and probe electrons and the \(Z\) can vary. In the following paragraphs we specify the identification criteria chosen to perform the study presented in this section.

Selection of the tag electron involves tight electron identification cuts [6] in the offline reconstruction to reduce background, and this electron must also trigger the event on its own, through a single electron trigger chain. As trigger efficiencies are measured with respect to one of the established offline electron definitions (the so-called "loose", "medium" or "tight" electron identification set of cuts, described in [6]), this selection is the one initially applied to the probe electron.

Additionally, both offline reconstructed electrons must pass kinematic cuts, _i.e._\(E_{T}>E_{T}^{cut}\) and \(|\eta|<2.4\), and not lie in the region between the barrel and endcap calorimeters (\(1.37<|\eta|<1.52\) region is excluded). The value of \(E_{T}^{cut}\) is chosen to be where the efficiency reaches its high-energy plateau in curves that show trigger efficiency versus transverse energy (such as the one shown in Fig. 11 ). When a trigger efficiency is plotted as a function of \(E_{T}\) or \(\eta\), the relevant kinematic selection is relaxed. Finally, there are topological constraints, namely that the two electrons have opposite charge, and that their combined invariant mass lies in the range \(70<m_{\rm ee}<110\) GeV.

At this point, the pair of electrons (tag and probe) may be considered for analysis. The trigger efficiency is defined by the frequency with which the probe electron in this sample passes the relevant trigger selection.

It is perfectly possible for the probe electron to satisfy the tag selection as well. In this case, the roles of tag and probe may be swapped, the tag becoming the probe and vice versa. Because the tag selection is at least as tight as the probe selection at every stage, the new probe passes the trigger selection automatically. Thus, tag and probe events fall into one of three categories:

* \(N_{1f}\) events where only one electron passes the tag cuts and the probe fails the trigger selection
* \(N_{1p}\) events where only one electron passes the tag cut and the probe passes the trigger selection
* \(N_{2p}\) events where both electrons pass the tag selection

Counting these events, the measured efficiency may be expressed as

\[\epsilon_{\text{``tag and probe''}}=\frac{N_{1p}+2N_{2p}}{N_{1f}+N_{1p}+2N_{2p} }=\frac{N_{\rm p}}{N_{\rm T}} \tag{1}\]

where \(N_{\rm p}\) and \(N_{\rm T}\) are defined by this equation. Assuming that the uncertainty in each variable is simply \(\sqrt{N}\), the statistical error on \(\epsilon\) is

\[\sigma_{\mathcal{E}}=\frac{1}{N_{\rm T}}\sqrt{\big{[}(1-2\epsilon)N_{\rm p}+ \epsilon^{2}N_{\rm T}+(1-\epsilon)^{2}\cdot 2N_{2p}\big{]}}. \tag{2}\]

Equation 2 may be generalized to allow for a more comprehensive uncertainty in \(N_{\rm p}\) and \(N_{\rm T}\). Equations 1 and 2 can be extended to be used for differential trigger efficiency measurements.

When using Monte Carlo simulated events, the truth record (_MC-Truth_) can be used to provide another estimate of the trigger efficiency. To understand the systematic uncertainty of the tag and probe method, the fractional efficiency difference between the trigger efficiency determined using tag and probe 

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:25]

at higher luminosities, in which tighter selection cuts would be applied. The \(E_{T}\) low threshold will, however, mean that background will be present in the invariant mass distribution of the two electrons for values smaller than the \(Z\) mass, allowing both sidebands to be used for background subtraction below the \(Z\) peak. Even with higher \(E_{T}\) thresholds, where only one sideband can be used, it is possible to extract the correct signal with a small additional systematic error [10].

The e20 signature foreseen for early running phase has looser electron identification cuts than the other single electron signature present in this menu, e10. Even though no isolation to other electromagnetic or hadronic activity in the calorimeters is required, the threshold of the transverse energy is sufficient to sustain a manageable rate. The trigger efficiencies for the different trigger levels with respect to the offline electron identification selections for the probe electron are shown in Table 14, both for the "tag and probe" method and with respect to _MC-Truth_, showing good agreement within the statistical error, and high trigger efficiencies. In Fig. 12 the trigger efficiency for e20 signature as a function of \(E_{T}\) and \(\eta\) is presented. It can be seen that the L2 efficiency is close to 100% with respect to the L1 efficiency already at very low transverse energy, the EF is almost 100% efficient with respect to L2. The

The efficiencies shown are relative to a tight offline electron identification selection as described in [6], as a function of the reconstructed \(E_{T}\)(left) and \(\eta\) (right). The tag and probe method (points) is compared to MC truth (lines). The lower two plots show the fractional efficiency difference (see Equation 3) between the two. The number of events used corresponds to 50 pb\({}^{-1}\). For this figure, the invariant mass cut is \(70<m_{\rm ee}<100\). Errors are statistical only. A signal sample of \(Z^{0}\to ee\) Monte Carlo simulation without background was used to obtain these results.

optimization for this trigger item made to minimize the loss of efficiency in these areas, especially not losing efficiency in the HLT with respect to L1 at large transverse energy. In the bottom part of the same figure the fractional efficiency difference between the "tag and probe" and _MC-Truth_ method as defined in Eq. 3 is shown, good agreement between both methods is observed.

Summary

An electron and photon trigger baseline for LHC commissioning and the first physics run have been presented. Many studies and tests have been summarized, without finding any problems that could compromise the successful start-up of ATLAS data-taking. Electron and photon trigger performance have been studied in detail in a wide energy range using single electron and single photon simulated samples. Trigger efficiency dependencies on transverse energy (\(E_{T}\)) and pseudo-rapidity (\(\eta\)) have been observed and studies are ongoing to explore the possibility to minimize them. Trigger efficiencies for the e/\(\gamma\) selection have been evaluated for simulations of different physics samples such as \(H\rightarrow\gamma\gamma\), \(Z\to ee\), \(W\to e\nu\) and some exotic channels. The electron and photon trigger menus for these selections have proven to be efficient above the threshold of the corresponding transverse energy cut with respect to offline reconstruction. The corresponding background rates have been estimated to be within the allocated bandwidth. It should be noted that due to current uncertainty in the cross-sections used for background estimations, rates could vary significantly. This could require the use of tighter selections with corresponding loss of signal efficiency. Some examples of backup signatures for such situations have been shown. Trigger robustness studies have been started, and are currently being extended. Trigger reconstruction and selection efficiencies do not show significant drops with respect to offline reconstructed electrons and photons. A method of trigger efficiency determination from data using \(Z\to ee\) decays has been studied in depth. This results compare well to trigger efficiency computed with respect to Monte Carlo truth. The extension of this method to other channels and samples are being developed.
