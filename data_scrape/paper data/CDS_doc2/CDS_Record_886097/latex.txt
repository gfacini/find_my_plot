The \(H\to\gamma\gamma\) decay mode for a Standard Model Higgs boson is expected to be a promising discovery channel in the \(110<M_{H}<140\) GeV mass range. It is a rare decay mode which places severe requirements on the electromagnetic calorimeter performance in terms of particle identification capabilities as well as energy and angular resolution. The last full simulation analysis results were published in the ATLAS Detector and Physics Performance Technical Design Report ("TDR" in the following) in 1999 [1]. A few important changes happened since then.

* _Material in front of the calorimeter._ Due to some changes in the Inner Detector layout and to a more accurate estimation of the pixel, SCT and TRT material and services, the material in front of the calorimeter has increased with respect to the TDR studies (by roughly 0.15 X\({}_{0}\) on average). This is responsible for an increase of the number of photon conversions and therefore for a degradation of the calorimeter performance.
* _Barrel-endcap gap._ The space required for the housing of the Inner Detector readout cables and services has changed with respect to the TDR design. In particular the gap between the barrel and the endcap electromagnetic calorimeters increased by 4 cm in the \(z\) coordinate: the endcap calorimeter performance is potentially affected by this extra gap due to the fact that, for geometrical reasons, the cells partially loose their projectivity towards the nominal interaction point.
* _Software framework._ The reconstruction software has completely migrated to C++ from the old Fortran framework used for the TDR analyses.

Due to the changes in the software and in the detector geometry, new sets of fully simulated Higgs bosons events with different masses have been produced with the most up-to-date geometry in the Data Challenge 1 (DC1) context (2002)[2]. The principal aim of the present analysis is to study the impact of these changes on the Higgs discovery potential in the \(\gamma\gamma\) decay channel.

The expected \(S/\sqrt{B}\) in this channel is proportional to the inverse of the mass resolution of the Higgs peak. As in the interesting range of Higgs masses the Higgs width is negligible (a few MeV), the Higgs mass resolution is dominated by the experimental mass resolution. This can be expressed as a function of the photon energy and position resolutions as:

\[\frac{\sigma_{M_{H}}}{M_{H}}=\frac{1}{2}\left[\frac{\sigma_{E_{1}}}{E_{1}} \oplus\frac{\sigma_{E_{1}}}{E_{2}}\oplus\frac{\sigma_{\alpha}}{\tan(\alpha/2) }\right], \tag{1}\]

where \(E_{1}\) and \(E_{2}\) are the energies of the two photons and \(\alpha\) is the angle between them.

In order to achieve the best signal significance, many critical issues (photons conversions, calibration, photon identification and vertex reconstruction) that may degrade the calorimeter performance have to be taken into account.

This paper is organized as follows. A brief description of the samples used is given in Sec. 2. The handling of photon conversion is described in Sec. 3. In Sec. 4 various aspects of the reconstruction of photons are discussed: calibration, clustering, energy and position corrections. Sec. 5 lists the cuts that are used to identify photons with respect to the jet background. The determination of the event primary vertex and the recalculation of the photon direction are addressed in Sec. 6. The results of the previous sections are combined together to estimate the number of expected Higgs signal events in Sec. 7. The processes contributing to the background are listed in Sec. 8. Finally, the discovery potential for different Higgs boson masses is reviewed in Sec. 9.

The study of the impact of detector inefficiencies on the \(H\to\gamma\gamma\) discovery potential is also partially addressed in this study: a first look at the effect of high voltage problems in the calorimeter sectors is reported in Sec. 10.

## 2 Signal samples

Sets of fully simulated \(H\to\gamma\gamma\) decay events with Higgs boson masses of 100, 120, 130 and 140 GeV have been generated using PYTHIA 6.203 [3] and the CTEQ5L structure function parametrization set. The gluon-gluon fusion and vector boson fusion production processes have been switched on (these two processes are generically called _direct production_). The results (see Sec. 9) have been rescaled using the cross sections and the branching ratios taken from [4] and listed in Table 1. To compare the results of this analysis with the TDR, the same cross sections as in the TDR, obtained from PHYTHIA 5.7 and CTEQ2L, have also been used.

The \(\mathbf{p}_{T}\), \(\eta\) and energy distributions of the generated Higgs bosons (\(M_{H}=120\) GeV) are shown in Figure 1. This figure also shows the same quantities for photons from the \(H\to\gamma\gamma\) decay.

The detector response has been simulated using the ATLASIM interface framework based on the GEANT 3 package [5]. The events have been generated during the DC1 production period with the most up-to-date detector geometry (called "DC1 geometry").

Electromagnetic clusters have been reconstructed using release 7.0.2 of Athena. Pile-up and electronic noise in the LAr electromagnetic calorimeters have also been considered and they have been applied at different stages of the simulation/recon

struction chain. A few caveats should be taken into account in order to better evaluate the final results.

* _Pile-up noise._ The pile-up noise for the DC1 production has been added at the calorimeter simulation level superimposing a proper number of minimum bias events to the physics signal. For this purpose a set of \(\simeq\) 5000 fully simulated minimum bias events have been produced and stored. In the simulation phase, a subset of these events is randomly selected depending on the luminosity: at high luminosity, for example, \(\simeq\) 23 minimum bias events per bunch crossing are expected. Taking into account that the typical signal duration in the electromagnetic calorimeter is \(\simeq\) 400 ns and that the time between bunch crossings is 25 ns, a total number of \(\simeq\) 700 minimum bias events affects a physics event generated at a given bunch crossing. Each minimum bias event is digitized and the corresponding shaped electronic signal is added in the calorimeter, cell by cell, with the proper time delay with respect to the considered physics signal. New files have been generated including pile-up for high (\(10^{34}\) cm\({}^{-2}\)s\({}^{-1}\)) and low (\(2\cdot 10^{33}\)cm\({}^{-2}\)s\({}^{-1}\)) luminosity. In the DC1 production only the peak value of the signal has been saved in the simulated files and so no optimal filtering can be applied during reconstruction. For this reason the pile-up contribution to the total noise is approximately correct at high luminosity while it is underestimated at low luminosity (see discussion in Appendix A).
* _Electronic noise._ The contribution of the electronic noise to the energy in the electromagnetic calorimeter is added at the reconstruction stage. The noise values have been deduced from the module 0 test-beam data after optimal filtering application in zero luminosity conditions [6][7]. The noise contribution is then applied in Athena by properly smearing the reconstructed energy in each calorimeter cell with the sigma of the measured noise. The same noise contribution is used at both high and low luminosity. With such procedure implemented in Athena 7.0.2, one would expect that the contribution of the electronics noise is underestimated both at low and high luminosity. However, the electronic noise contribution appears to be overestimated (by a factor \(\sim 2\)) with respect to other studies (see discussion in Appendix A).

As no optimal filtering can be applied the total contribution of pile-up and electronic noise is not optimized. The global effect of the DC1 handling of pile-up and electronic noise is that the total noise contribution is slightly overestimated both at high and low luminosity due to the overestimation of the electronic noise.

## 3 Photon conversions

A critical item that should be carefully considered is the number of photon conversions in the material in front of the electromagnetic calorimeter (beam pipe, inner detector, calorimeter cryostat). Converted photons are dangerous since they start showeringbefore the beginning of the calorimeter thus degrading the energy resolution in the detector. In addition, the energy deposition in the calorimeter due to a converted photon is geometrically broader than a non converted photon thus requiring a larger cluster size (see Sec. 4.3). Early conversions are the most dangerous as the two electrons open up in the Inner Detector magnetic field and can be collected in two separate clusters.

Photon conversions are expected to be identified with an 80% efficiency using tracks reconstructed in the Inner Detector if the conversion occurs in a \(R<80\) cm and \(|z|<280\) cm region [9][10]. In Figure 2 the conversion points in this region have been plotted in a \(R-z\) plane generating a picture of the Inner Detector material distribution since the density of the points is higher in correspondence with the Inner Detector layers.

Due to the increase of the total amount of material in front of the calorimeter the number of photon conversions is higher in DC1 than in the TDR: the comparison between the two layouts is shown in Table 2.

The numbers in this table have been obtained for conversions within \(R<80\) cm and \(|z|<280\) cm. If the entire Inner Detector cavity (\(R<115\) cm and \(|z|<350\) cm) is considered the conversion probability e. g., increases from 24% to 31%. The conversion probability as a function of \(\eta\) is shown in Figure 2.

As no full-fledged photon conversion finder algorithm was available at the time of this note, we decided to identify conversions by looking at the Montecarlo information directly. Only conversions occurring in the region \(R<80\) cm and \(|z|<280\) cm were tagged as conversion and, among these, we applied a 80% efficiency (independent of photon \(\eta\), \(p_{T}\) and conversion radius) in a somewhat conservative agreement with the results reported in [9][10].

## 4 Photon reconstruction

In this section we discuss photon reconstruction and calibration. Sec. 4.1 describes the calibration procedure and the corrections that have been used in this analysis. Finally, in Sec. 4.2 we show the performance of the implemented calibration scheme on single photon events.

### Calibration

The reconstruction and offline calibration of photons proceed through the following three main steps:

* _Cell calibration_: each calorimeter cell is calibrated using a _normalization factor_ (\(\lambda\)) which equalizes the cells response to a common electromagnetic scale.
* _Clustering_: cells are clustered together using a sliding window algorithm;
* _Cluster calibration_: when a cluster is classified as an _electromagnetic cluster_, a proper set of corrections are applied to its energy and position.

Photons have been calibrated using a 100k sample of 100 GeV energy photon generated with a flat distribution in the \(0<|\eta|<2.5\) region. The photons have been generated with a \(\sigma_{z}=5.6\) cm vertex spread around the nominal interaction point.

The calibration strategy discussed in this section, although of general validity, have been optmized for the \(H\rightarrow\gamma\gamma\) analysis. This calibration scheme has been implemented in the official liquid Argon calorimeter reconstruction software for the Athena 7.0.2 release. However in this analysis a private version of the 7.0.2 release has been used with a slight difference in the order in which the corrections are applied.

In the official realese material and leakage corrections (see Sec. 4.1.3) are applied at cell level since this was required for calibration of jets and missing \(p_{T}\). In the analysis presented in this work, each calorimeter cell is calibrated using only the normalization factor (\(\lambda\)) computed in Sec. 4.1.1. In this approach the cell calibration should be of general validity while all particle-dependent corrections are moved to the cluster level after particle identification.

#### 4.1.1 Normalization scale

The average response of the calorimeter to a set of photons hitting the calorimeter in a given \(\eta\) bin, has been calculated by summing the energy over all the calorimeter cells (i.

e., assuming an infinite cluster size). The middle granularity has been assumed for the binning1 of the calorimeter. The normalization scale factor for the electromagnetic calibration of the calorimeter cells has been computed equalizing the calorimeter response to the deposited energy. The deposited energy in the calorimeter has been obtained by subtracting the upstream and downstream energy losses from the nominal energy, as in the DC1 simulated samples it was not possible to access the energy lost in dead and inactive materials. These losses have been estimated by applying the weighting procedure described in Sec. 4.1.3 on the uncalibrated energy.

Footnote 1: The longitudinal segmentation of the calorimeter and the size of the read-out cells are briefly recollected in Appendix B.

The normalization factor of the calorimeter cells as a function of \(\eta\) is shown in Figure 3. In the barrel region the curve reflects the variation of the inverse of the calorimeter sampling fraction. The step at about \(\eta=0.8\) is due to a change in the thickness of the calorimeter absorbers which leads to a different sampling fraction. At \(\eta=1.8\), where the endcap presampler ends, a discontinuity can also be seen. The curves for the barrel and the endcap overlap at about \(\eta\sim 1.5\) as there is a small overlap between the barrel and endcap calorimeters (see Appendix B). The behaviour of \(\lambda\) as a function of \(\eta\) in the endcap region has the following explanation. In the endcap calorimeter, for geometrical reasons, the liquid Argon gap thickness decreases with \(\eta\) as the true sampling fraction. As the scale factor is proportional to the inverse of the sampling fraction, one would expect the endcap scale factor to increase with \(\eta\). However, in the Geant 3 simulation of the endcap electromagnetic calorimeter, the energies deposited in the liquid Argon (E\({}_{dep}\)) have been corrected in order to take into account tha gap

thickness (\(g\)) dependence so that the effective output energy (E\({}_{signal}\)) is

\[E_{signal}=E_{dep}\left(\frac{g_{0}}{g}\right)^{1.3} \tag{2}\]

where g\({}_{0}\) has been chosen to be the average value of the gap at \(\eta\simeq 2.4\). This explains why the scale factor is decreasing with \(\eta\) in the endcap (see Fig. 3) while one would expect the opposite.

#### 4.1.2 Cluster corrections

In the electromagnetic calorimeter reconstruction software a sliding window algorithm is used to search for clusters.

The algorithm loops on all the calorimeter cells and calculates the total energy deposited in a specific window around the considered cell: a cluster is found when the energy deposition is greater than a given threshold. Both the sliding window size and the threshold can be selected by the user.

The position and energy of each cluster is reconstructed using a fixed-size rectangular window. The clusters are built in different sizes in the \(\eta-\phi\) coordinates in order to use the optimal dimension for a given physics analysis. The energy of the cluster is then computed by summing the energies of all the cells of the cluster in the various samplings while the position of the cluster is determined in each compartment by calculating the barycenter of the deposited energies.

The global \(\eta\) position of the \(e/\gamma\) objects is obtained from an average of the \(\eta\) positions in each layer weighted by the intrisic compartment resolutions (see also Sec. 4.1.6). The position in \(\phi\) is measured from the second sampling only which has the best granularity in the azimuthal coordinate. The energy and position of the clusters are then refined correcting for effects due to the clustering algorithm and the calorimeter design as described in the following sections.

#### 4.1.3 Material and leakage corrections

A particle coming from the interaction point, before entering the electromagnetic calorimeter, can deposit a certain amount of energy in the upstream material. Furthermore, for particles with energy of the order of 100 GeV or more, the energy resolution is degraded due to longitudinal leakage fluctuations. The empiric method used to correct for these effects is based on the assumption that the energy lost by an incoming particle in the material in front of the calorimeter and the leakage can be recovered by properly weighting the presampler and back compartment energy. With this hypothesis the total reconstructed energy can be written as a weighted sum of the energies in the different longitudinal compartments in the following way:

\[E_{tot}=w_{1}\cdot E_{1}+E_{2}+E_{3}+w_{4}\cdot E_{4} \tag{3}\]

where \(E_{i}\) is the energy in the \(i\)-th calorimeter compartment (presampler, strips, middle and back) after cell calibration. For \(1.8<\eta<2.5\), where no preampler is available, the strips sampling is reweighted. In the present work, the sampling weights have been determined minimizing the relative energy resolution \(\sigma(E_{tot})/\langle E_{tot}\rangle\), using a technique developed for the electromagnetic barrel test-beam analysis [11].

The sampling weights calculation has been performed on fully simulated single photon events. They have been reconstructed by including the scale calibration factor (computed in Sec. 4.1.1) at the cell level. For each sampling the total reconstructed energy has been calculated by summing all over the calorimeter cells in a given layer. The weights are calculated running the minimization algorithm on such energies so that they do not depend on the cluster size. No electronic and pile-up noise has been included.

The events have been divided into \(\Delta\eta=0.025\) bins (corresponding to the middle layer granularity) with respect to the generated \(\eta\) position and the weights for the four samplings have been calculated in each bin. The photon samples have also been studied computing different sets of sampling weights for _converted_ and _unconverted_ photons (conversions are tagged using the "truth" information as described in Sec. 3).

Figure 4 shows the \(\eta\) dependence of the computed sampling weights for different data samples. Due to the presence of cracks at \(\eta=0\) and \(\eta=2.5\), in the \(\eta<0.1\) and \(\eta>2.4\) regions the weights have been obtained as extrapolation from adjacent regions.

The normalization scale discussed in the previous section has been calculated at the cluster level and then applied at each cell. This implies that there is a small residual miscalibration. To correct for this effect and keep the absolute scale (given by the 100 GeV energy incident photons) the final weights have been rescaled. The weights shown in Fig. 4 accounts for this correction and this explains why the weights for middle and strips are slightly different from unity.

The energy dependence of the sampling weights has been studied using single photons with fixed \(\eta\) values and different energies from 5 to 200 GeV. The sampling weights for photons as a function of the incoming particle energy at \(\eta=0.3\) are shown in Fig

Figure 4: Energy weights as a function of \(\eta\) for presampler and strips (left) and middle and back (right) for 100 GeV photons.

#### 4.1.4 Out-of-cone corrections

The reconstruction software provides clusters of six different sizes. The cluster size is usually expressed in number of middle sampling cells in the (\(\eta\),\(\phi\)) coordinates: in this notation 3x3, 3x5, 3x7, 5x5, 5x7, 7x7 sizes are available. The energy measured in the window is smaller than the true particle energy and proper correction factors have been computed for each cluster dimension normalizing the mean reconstructed energy with the true energy of the incoming particle. Sample out-of-cone corrections for 100 GeV photons as a function of \(\eta\) are shown in Figure 6.

Two considerations should be done:

* In a first approximation the energy dependence of the containment corrections has not taken into account. This assumption fails for low energy (\(\simeq 10\) GeV) electrons and converted photons which should be treated separately.
* For precision physics analysis such as the \(H\rightarrow\gamma\gamma\) decay, different containment corrections for converted and unconverted photons have been studied.

#### 4.1.5 \(\phi\) and \(\eta\) modulations

The energy response of the electromagnetic calorimeter depends on the (\(\eta\),\(\phi\)) position inside the central cell of the cluster due to the following effects:

* \(\phi\)_-modulation_: the amount of passive material crossed by an incident particle varies as a function of the position in \(\phi\) inside a cell due to the accordion geometry. This gives rise to a response modulation with a peak corresponding to

Figure 5: Energy dependence of the longitudinal weights for photons at \(\eta\) = 0.3

Figure 6: Containment corrections as a function of \(\eta\) for different cluster sizes: correction for converted and unconverted photons are also plotted separately.

the absorber accordion bend where the amount of liquid Argon is bigger due to the finite bending radius. This effect is partially compensated by the fact that for the same reason the electric field in the folds is lower than the nominal value.
* \(\eta\)_-modulation:_ the energy of a showering particle (see Sec. 4.1.4) is not fully contained in the cluster used for the reconstruction especially for small cluster \(\eta\) sizes. For this reason the calorimeter response could in principle depend on the particle impact point inside a cell: the response is maximum for particles hitting the center of the cell and drops at the cell edges.

The correction for the variation of the energy response as a function of \(\phi\) and \(\eta\) (so called "\(\phi\) and \(\eta\) modulations") were switched off in the reconstruction. In the offline version used for this note (7.0.2), a new set of correction functions was not determined but rather the old TDR correction functions were available. These corrections showed to degrade the energy resolution, so we decided not to apply them in the Athena reconstruction. To overcome this limitation, a new set of corrections were calculated and applied at n-tuple level. The photons in the 120 GeV Higgs boson samples were used to evaluate the corrections. Due to the limited statistics available, the \(\phi\) modulation corrections were calculated in bins of 0.2 along \(\eta\) and the \(\eta\) modulation corrections separately for the barrel and endcap calorimeters. The energy dependence has not been studied. Sample correction factors for the \(\phi\) and \(\eta\) modulations are shown in Figure 7.

Modulation of the response along \(\eta\) (blue dots) and the function (full curve) used for the correction in the barrel (right plot). A 3x5 cluster size has been used.

#### 4.1.6 S-shape correction for \(\eta\) position reconstruction

The shower barycenter in the \(\eta\) coordinate is measured separately in the various calorimeter compartments with different intrinsic resolutions [1]. The measurements from the strips and middle compartments are used to extract a global \(\eta\) value. In the middle sampling, \(\eta\) is computed by calculating the barycenter of the energies measured in each cell of cluster while in the strips only the strip with the maximum energy content and the two neighbours are used for the barycenter computation. Due to the finite granularity of the detector, especially in the second sampling, the difference between the true and the computed barycenter as a function of the position inside the cell has a typical S-shape.

In the offline version used in this note (7.0.2), correction functions were determined using 100 GeV photons: for strips and middle compartments and separately for barrel and end-cap [14]. At the time of the TDR, a 10% to 18% improvement with respect to such a technique was obtained by using the S-shape correction in the middle compartment determined using a Neural Network technique [1][16]. The N. N. determined the S-shape corrections in the barrel and in the end-cap as a function of three parameters: the position of the shower in the cell (relative to the cell boundary), the shower pseudorapidity and the fraction of the energy measured in the first compartment (used as a measurement of the shower depth). No such technique was available for the studies presented in this note.

#### 4.1.7 \(\phi\)-offset correction

The cluster position in \(\phi\) is determined from the energy barycenter in the second sampling only [1]. The \(\phi\) position measure is affected by an \(\eta\)-dependent offset that can be corrected for. The offset is due to the accordion shape and depends on the beginning of the middle compartment with respect to the folds of the accordion. Along \(\eta\) the offset follows the strips-middle segmentation on the electrodes. The correction has been obtained using \(E_{T}=60\) GeV photons [14].

### Calorimeter performance

After the application of the energy calibration scheme and of the position corrections described in the previous section, sets of photons of various energies have been used to validate the performance. Some of these tests are reported in this section.

#### 4.2.1 Energy reconstruction, resolution and linearity

The behaviour of the energy resolution (\(\sigma E/E\)) as a function of the photon energy at fixed point (\(\eta=0.3\), \(3\times 5\) cluster size) is shown in Fig. 8. From a fit to the curve a sampling term of about 9% has been obtained.

Figure 8 also shows the ratio of the reconstructed to true energy as a function of the true photon energy. The linearity is within a few per mille for photons with energy greater than about 20 GeV. The calibration becomes less accurate going to lower energies. More detailed and careful work is needed for low energy photons [15].

Figure 8: Upper left: Energy resolution as a function of photon energy at \(\eta=0.3\). The results of the superimposed fit are also shown. Upper right: Energy linearity for photons at \(\eta=0.3\). Lower left: Reconstructed energy (upper plots) and energy resolution (lower plots) for 100 GeV unconverted photons as a function of \(\eta\) for different cluster sizes. The red lines on the reconstructed energy plots delimit the \(\pm\) 1% band. Lower right: Same as previous plot for converted photons.

The mean value of the reconstructed energy and the energy resolution as a function of \(\eta\) for 100 GeV photons and different cluster sizes are also shown in Figure 8. The energy resolution has been evaluated with a gaussian fit on the reconstructed energy distributions: converted and unconverted photons have been studied separately.

A larger cluster size ensures a better energy reconstruction and resolution, especially for converted photons. Nevertheless the pile-up and electronic noise contributions also increases with the cluster dimension and the optimal cluster size should be chosen looking for the best compromise between these opposite effects. This is further discussed in Sec. 4.3.

#### 4.2.2 \(\phi\) resolution

The \(\phi\) position reconstruction capabilities of the electromagnetic calorimeter have been investigated on various samples of single particles with different energies (and including the \(\phi\)-offset correction discussed in Sec. 4.1.7). For each \(\eta\) bin and cluster size the distributions of \(\phi_{rec}-\phi_{mc}\) have been built and the \(\phi\) resolution has been estimated from a gaussian fit to these distributions. In Figure 9 results for 100 GeV unconverted photons are shown. The calorimeter \(\phi\) resolution scales approximatly as \(4-6\) mrad\(/\sqrt{E}\).

#### 4.2.3 \(\eta\) resolution

The intrinsic \(\eta\) resolution for middle and strips samplings has been studied from a comparison with the Montecarlo. For each \(\eta\) bin the \(\eta_{strips}-\eta_{mc}\) and \(\eta_{middle}-\eta_{mc}\) distri

Light blue triangles represent the strips \(\eta\) resolution which is independent of the cluster size. Both plots are for 100 GeV unconverted plots.

butions have been produced for various cluster sizes. As already recalled in Sec. 4.1.6, the \(\eta\) value in the strips sampling is determined using only three strips and therefore it is indipendent from the cluster size: an example of the \(\eta\) resolution for 100 GeV unconverted photons is shown in Fig. 9. The resolution of the measurement by the strips is on average three times better than that by the middle. The broader granularity is responsible for the strips resolution worsening in the endcaps with increasing \(\eta\).

#### 4.2.4 \(\theta\) and \(z\) vertex reconstruction

The photon direction has been determined combining the information from the strips and middle calorimeter layers. Where available also the presampler measurement has been included. The method is described in detail in Sec. 6.

For each \(\eta\) bin the reconstructed photon \(\theta^{rec}\) and \(z_{v}^{rec}\) have been compared with the true values: The resolutions on \(\theta\) and \(z_{v}\) have been computed from a gaussian fit on the corresponding distributions and the results are shown in Figure 10.

#### 4.2.5 Calorimeter Performance Summary

The results shown in the previous sections show that the requirements for the \(H\to\gamma\gamma\) analysis are generally fulfilled: the sampling term of the energy resolution can be kept at the level of \(10\%/\sqrt{E}\) and the linearity has found to be acceptable in the energy range of interest for this analysis (\(E_{T}>25\) GeV). More detailed studies are required for low energy particles and for converted photons. The resolution on the \(\theta\) angle measurement is of the order of \(60\,\mbox{mrad}/\sqrt{E}\) and \(4-6\,\mbox{mrad}/\sqrt{E}\) on the \(\phi\) position.

### Higgs photon calibration issues

The calibration scheme described above has been applied to all Higgs samples used for the analysis reported in this paper. Additionally, in order to improve the Higgs mass resolution the converted photons have been carefully studied. This lead to the use of different sets of out-of-cone corrections for converted and unconverted photons. This feature is not available in the standard 7.0.2 reconstruction code (see also discussion in Sec. 4.1).

As an example of the result, in Fig. 11 we show the ratio of the calibrated energy to the true energy as a function of \(\eta\) for converted and unconverted photons and as a function of the conversion radius for converted photons with two different cluster sizes (from \(H\rightarrow\gamma\gamma\) decay with M\({}_{H}\) = 120 GeV). A \(3\times 7\) cluster is used for converted photons in this paper. For unconverted photons a \(3\times 5\) (\(5\times 5\)) cluster is used in the barrel (endcap). The choice of the cluster size for the end-cap is discussed in Appendix C. For a complete discussion of cluster sizes see also reference [1].

Finally, in the simulation all the effects that contribute to the calorimeter resolution constant term [1], which by design needs to be kept at the level of 0.7%, are not fully taken into account.

Assuming that the simulation accounts only for a constant term of about \(c_{sim}=0.3\)% [12], a constant term \(c_{reco}=0.63\)% has been introduced in the analysis (so that \(c=c_{sim}\oplus c_{reco}\) = 0.7%) by smearing the reconstructed photons energy.

Figure 11: Left: ratio of reconstructed to true Higgs photons energy as a function of \(\eta\). Converted and uncoverted photons are also shown separately. In the right plot the same quantity is shown as a function of the conversion radius for converted photons. The results for two different cluster size are shown.

Photon identification

The two photons from the Higgs boson decay have been identified using two different kind of approach.

* The reconstructed clusters have been matched with the Montecarlo information, so that to each generated photon has been associated the cluster that minimize the distance \(\Delta R=\sqrt{\Delta\eta^{2}+\Delta\phi^{2}}\). Afterwards an 80% efficiency on all photons has been applied. This is the same approach as in the TDR, so it has been used to compare this analysis with those results.
* A series of cuts has been studied to separate \(\gamma\) from jets [13]. The cuts are similar to those studied in [1] and [10] and have been optimized to keep an 80% efficiency in the \(\eta\) and \(\mathrm{p}_{T}\) regions relevant to Higgs studies. In the latter case, the cuts are based on the energy deposited in the hadronic calorimeter and in the middle and strip samplings of the electromagnetic calorimeter. No trigger, track veto or isolation cuts have been applied in this analysis. The cuts applied are the followings: **Cut on the energy of the hadronic calorimeter.** 1. As photons deposit almost all of their energy in the electromagnetic calorimeter, a high leakage in the hadronic identifies a cluster as due to a jet. The ratio between the transverse energy deposited in a \(\Delta\eta\times\Delta\phi\) = 0.2 \(\times\) 0.2 window of the first sampling of the hadronic calorimeter and the total tranverse energy deposited in the electromagnetic calorimeter is used as discriminating variable. The actual cut is \(\eta\) dependant. **Cut on the second sampling (middle) of the EM calorimeter.** 2. Photon showers are typically narrower than those initiated by jets, so the shower shape is a good variable to separate \(\gamma\)'s from jets. A cut on the shower shape along \(\eta\) is applied by using as discriminating variable the ratio between the shower energy collected in a \(3\times 7\) cluster in the middle and the energy collected in a \(7\times 7\) cluster: \(E_{2}(3\times 7)/E_{2}(7\times 7)\). 3. A cut similar to the previous one is applied on the \(\phi\) shape of the shower by cutting on the variable: \(E_{2}(3\times 3)/E_{2}(3\times 7)\). As converted photons produce showers which are broader in \(\phi\), this cut has less discriminating power than the previous one. 4. A cut on the shower width in the \(\eta\) direction is applied. The shower width has been calculated as: \[\omega_{\eta 2}=\sqrt{\sum E_{ij}\cdot\eta_{ij}^{2}/\sum E_{ij}-(\sum E_{ij} \cdot\eta_{ij}/\sum E_{ij})^{2}}.\] where \(E_{ij}\) and \(\eta_{ij}\) are the energy and pseudorapidity of each cell and the sums runs on 3 cells in \(\eta\) and 5 in \(\phi\).

**First sampling cuts.**

The previous cuts selects electrons, photons and narrow jets. These jets consist mainly of \(\pi\)'s, \(\eta\)'s or \(\omega\)'s decaying to two photons. Thanks to the very fine granularity of the first sampling, the substructure of a cluster can be investigated, to reject these kind of jets. For this analysis it is required that at least 0.5% of the total electromagnetic energy is deposited in the first sampling, otherwise these cuts are skipped and the nature of the cluster, electromagnetic or hadronic, is decided by the previous cuts (_i._ to _iv._) only.

(For the following two cuts, the first maximum is defined as the highest energy strip in the cluster. Then a \(\Delta\eta\times\Delta\phi=0.125\times 0.2\) is formed around the maximum and the cell with the next highest energy-second maximum- is looked for).
* A cluster is considered as a photon cluster if the second maximum in the cluster is below a certain threshold. The cut on the energy of the second maximum depends linearly on the total transverse energy.
* To further improve the previous cut, also the difference between the energy in the strip with the second maximum and the minimal value of the energy between the first and second maxima should be below a certain threshold.
* A cut on the cluster width is applied. The cluster width is calculated as \[\omega_{tot1}=\sqrt{\sum E_{i}(i-i_{max})^{2}/\sum E_{i}},\] where \(i\) is the strip index, \(i_{max}\) is the strip where the first maximum is located and \(E_{i}\) is the energy in each strip. The width is calculated in a window of size \(\pm 0.0625\) around the maximum (which corresponds to a total of about 40 strips in the barrel calorimeter).
* A cut on the cluster width similar to the previous cut (_vii._) is also applied. However, in this case the cluster width is calculated using a three strips only (\(i\) from \(i_{max}-1\) to \(i_{max}+1\) in the previous formula).
* At last, a cut on the fraction of energy outside the shower core in \(\eta\) is applied. The shower core is calculated from the energies in windows of 3 and 7 strips centered around the strip with the highest energy as: \[(E_{1}(7\mbox{\leavevmode\nobreak\ {strips}})-E_{1}(3\mbox{\leavevmode\nobreak\ {strips}}))/E_{1}(3\mbox{\leavevmode\nobreak\ {strips}})\]

**Run condition** & **Uncovered** & **Converted** & **All** \\ \hline \hline Low Luminosity & 88.2\% & 69.8\% & 84.4\% \\ High Luminosity & 90.6\% & 70.5\% & 86.4\% \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 3: Summary of photon identification efficiencies on \(H\rightarrow\gamma\gamma\) photons (\(M_{H}=120\) GeV).

The identification efficiency of these cuts has been tested on the photons from Higgs boson decay passing the kinematic cuts listed in Section 7. In Figure 12 and in Table 3 the efficiency of the photon identification in the 120 GeV Higgs sample is summarized: both low and high luminosity results are reported. The cuts have been optimized separately for low and high luminosity.

Sample plots of the above variables for photons and jets, the complete list of cuts used (which are \(\eta\) and \(p_{T}\) dependent) and the rejection achievable against gluon and quark jets are discussed in great detail in Ref. [13].

## 6 Primary vertex determination and photon pointing

In order to reduce the contribution of the angular term to the mass resolution (Equation 1), the photon direction must be known with good accuracy. The standard position reconstruction algorithm will assume that the \(\gamma\)'s are coming from the nominal interaction vertex assumed to coincide with the center of the ATLAS detector (\(\vec{O}=(0,0,0)\)).

At the LHC the interaction point will be known with good accuracy only in the transverse plane (\(\sigma_{x,y}=15\)\(\mu\)m) while in the \(z\) direction the vertex will have a spread of about \(\sigma_{z}=5.6\) cm. This spread along the beam line direction compromises the Higgs mass resolution if not corrected for. So it is necessary to reconstruct the position of the primary vertex along the beam direction. As the two Higgs photons do not provide any charged track that can be reconstructed in the Inner Detector (unless they convert), the primary vertex has to be determined from the tracks produced with the Higgs boson.

The presence of pile-up is dangerous to the success of this technique as the presence of additional interaction vertices from minimun bias interaction (about 2.3 at low lu

minosity and 23 at high luminosity) might lead to the association of the Higgs photons to a wrong vertex. In this case a series of cuts usually based on the vertex track multiplicity and/or on the \(\sum p_{T}\) of the tracks at the vertex are needed. However, these cuts depend on the Higgs \(p_{T}\) spectrum and on the characteristic of the underlying events and of the minimum bias events at the LHC.

The calorimeter allows a stand-alone measurement of the \(\gamma\) direction thanks to its longitudinal division in three samplings. Particularly important is the first samplig with its fine subdivision along \(\eta\) in 4-mm wide strips. This method is described in the following sections.

### Procedure for vertex recomputation

The starting point of the procedure is the photon \(\eta\) direction as calculated in the standard offline reconstruction (7.0.2). This is computed by default as a weighted average of the \(\eta\) position in the strip and middle compartments of the electromagnetic calorimeter. It is assumed that the photon is coming from a vertex located in the center of the ATLAS experiment. In our analysis, the \(\eta\) direction of each Higgs photon has been recomputed from a \(\chi^{2}\) fit method in the R-Z plane applied to the \(\eta\) values measured in the strips, middle and presampler (the presampler is used where available: \(|\eta|<1.8\)) calorimeter layers.

#### 6.1.1 Description of the fit procedure

The procedure developed goes through a series of steps described in detail in the following.

* Starting points of the fit. The starting points of the fit are the \(\eta\) values measured in each compartment of the calorimeter and presampler.
* Determination of the shower position in each compartment. For each \(\eta\) value the radius of the shower \(R_{i}\) in each compartment \(i\) has been calculated. For photons in the barrel region, for each compartment, the R coordinate is given by the average longitudinal position of the \(\gamma\) shower (Figure 14). The longitudinal position has been calculated with Geant 3 (and tabulated in routine _qdepth.F_). Given \(\eta_{i}\) and \(R_{i}\), the \(z_{i}\) of the shower is calculated by elementary trigonometrical relations.
* Fit. Given the position of the shower in the various compartments, a straight line \(\chi^{2}\) fit to these points is performed: \[\chi^{2}=\sum_{i}w_{i}(aR_{i}+b-z_{i})^{2}.\] (4) The weight \(w_{i}=1/\sigma_{z}^{2}\) of each layer has been computed from the \(\eta\) position resolutions (Figure 14) in the various samplings, using 100 GeV single photon samples. It should be pointed out that in the end-cap region, the two variables \(R\) and \(z\) get exchanged in the fit formula.

#### 6.1.2 Additional information available for the fit

If available, an independent measurement of the primary vertex can be included (with its uncertainty) in the photon direction fit. In this note we will consider and present results for the following cases:

* _Low luminosity._ We will consider two cases: calorimeter-only \(\gamma\) direction reconstruction and \(\gamma\) direction reconstruction using both calorimeter information and an independent estimate of the primary vertex position using the Inner Detector. In the latter case we will assume that the Inner Detector will be able to reconstruct the z coordinate of the primary vertex with a resolution of \(\sigma_{z}=40\)\(\mu\)m [1]. So in our analyisis we have spread the true vertex position with such a resolution and added this point in the fit.
* _High luminosity._ At high luminosity as it is more difficult to identify the Higgs primary vertex among the pile-up vertices (although studies performed in the past looked promising [1]) we present results for calorimeter-only direction reconstruction. In this case, we add to the fit the nominal position of the LHC vertex (\(z_{v}=0\)) with the machine design spread \(\sigma_{z}=5.6\) cm.

In all the above cases additional spatial information on the direction of the \(\gamma\)'s is available in case of converted photons. The Inner Detector is expected to determine the \(z_{c}\) and \(R_{c}\) coordinate of a photon conversion. As a conversion recontruction algorithm has not been implemented yet in the official software, in the case of converted photons the \(z_{c}\) measured from the inner detector is simulated by smearing the true Montecarlo \(z_{c}^{mc}\) depending on the conversion radius and this additional point is used

Figure 14: Left: average longitudinal position (\(R\) coordinate in barrel and \(z\) in the endcap) for barrel and end-cap showers. Right: Position resolution (\(z\) in the barrel and \(R\) in the endcap) as a function of \(\eta\) in the strips and middle sampling.

in the direction reconstruction fit. The resolutions on the \(z\) coordinate, as a function of the conversion radius, are taken from [9]; the uncertainty on the conversion radius is neglected. Conversion occurring at \(R_{\rm c}>\) 40 cm have not been used in the fit. The conversion point has been used as an additional point in the fit for all the results presented in this note.

### Additional checks

If only the calorimeter information is used, the geometrical fit is dominated by the strips. So, if the energy deposited in the strips is too small, the fit could fail, returning a very bad set of new coordinates. The difference between the reconstructed and the true photon pseudorapidity as a function of the energy in the strips is shown in Figure 16. Based on this plot a cut at \(E_{strips}=0.2\) GeV has been applied. For photons below this cut (about 1% of the total), the fit is not applied and the standard offline direction has been kept (see Sec. 4.1.6).

Figure 15 shows the difference between the photon \(\eta\) (recalculated from the ntuples values to be expressed with respect to the true Montecarlo Higgs vertex) in the strips and middle compartment and the true \(\eta\) (taken from the ntuples: these values are already referred to the true Higgs vertex) for a photon in the barrel and in the end-cap calorimeter. A shift in the reconstructed position is observed in the end-cap. The shift in the middle is about \(1/25\) of the cell at \(\eta=2\), while no evident shift is present in the strips. The shift is such that the centre of a shower is shifted to lower (higher) values for positive (negative) \(\eta\). We believe this is a geometrical effect due to the fact that the cells are asymmetric with respect to the photon direction, since their front face is at fixed \(z\) (\(R\)) in the end-cap (barrel), rather then perpendicular to the particle direction.

If uncorrected this effect would lead to a systematic shift of the reconstructed event

barrel-endcap transition region \(1.4<|\eta|<1.55\) and the last part of the endcap outer wheel \(2.45<|\eta|<2.5\). The barrel-endcap gap is briefly discussed in Appendix E.

The mass resolutions shown in the following have been determined from an asymmetric gaussian fit (\([-2\sigma,+3\sigma]\)) of the invariant mass peak. The asymmetric window is used to reduce the impact of the residual low energy tails in the distribution (see also Sec. 7.4). The mass window for the evaluation of the signal significance (for brief, the mass bin in the following) has been defined as \(\pm 1.4\)\(\sigma\) around the central value.

For the comparison with the TDR results (see Sec. 7.1) no photon identification cuts have been applied as depicted in the left part of Figure 22. A constant photon identification efficiency of 80%, as used in the TDR, has been assumed when evaluating the signal acceptance.

Photon identification cuts have been applied for the results presented in Sec. 7.2 and Sec. 7.3 (see right part of Figure 22). The handling of conversion is the same in all cases: the procedure is illustrated in Figure 23. Conversions are tagged using the truth information and are assumed to be reconstructed with a 80% efficiency if occured within a radius of 80 cm from the beam axis. Converted (unconverted) photons are reconstructed using a \(3\times 7\) (\(3\times 5\)) cluster. If a photon has a conversion vertex inside a radius of 40 cm, the conversion point is used in the fit of the photon direction (see Sec. 6).

### Comparison with TDR results

As a first step, a comparison of our results with the ones obtained at the time of TDR has been attempted. To be as close as possible to the assumption used in the TDR, the same cross sections and branching ratio used in TDR have been applied. Moreover, no photon identification cuts have been applied: an 80% efficiency has been assumed when evaluating the acceptance.

In Table 5 the results reported in the TDR and the ones obtained in this analysis are compared for the high luminosity scenario. An increase in mass resolution from about 10% to 15%, depending on the Higgs mass, is observed. This will be further investigated in Section 7.5.

### Results at low luminosity (\(2\cdot 10^{33}\) cm\({}^{-2}\)s\({}^{-1}\))

For the new analysis, the photon identification method using Montecarlo information has been replaced with the real photon identification method using the calorimeter information.

In low luminosity conditions the \(H\rightarrow\gamma\gamma\) decay has been studied in two different configurations: in the first case the direction reconstruction has been performed using the Inner Detector primary vertex \(z_{v}\) information while in the second case only the calorimeter information has been used. In both configurations conversion information has been included in the direction recomputation.

The invariant mass distributions obtained with both methods for \(M_{H}\) = 100, 120, 130 and 140 GeV are plotted in Figure 24 and 25.

As can be noticed in the mentioned plots the reconstructed invariant mass is well calibrated and nicely gaussian although a low energy tail is still present mainly due to converted photons (yellow histogram in figure): \(\simeq 79\%\) of the events are contained in the \(\pm 1.4\)\(\sigma\) interval around the nominal Higgs mass while for a Gaussian distribution this fraction is expected to be 83.8%.

The acceptances and mass resolutions in the two cases for different Higgs bosons masses after each step of the analysis are summarized in Tables 6 and 7.

### Results at high luminosity (\(10^{34}\) cm\({}^{-2}\)s\({}^{-1}\) )

In the high luminosity case, only the calorimeter information is used to reconstruct the photon directions. Conversion information has also been included in the fit. The \(\gamma\gamma\) pair invariant mass plots are shown in Figure 26.

The detailed list of acceptances and mass resolutions for different Higgs bosons masses are summarized in Table 8.

### Study of low and high mass tails

The study of the tails is important in order to understand reconstruction problems and to recover from them. The study has been performed at low luminosity (\(2\cdot 10^{33}\) cm\({}^{-2}\)s\({}^{-1}\)) for a Higgs boson mass of 120 GeV using the calorimeter to reconstruct the event vertex.

The low tail (for \(m_{\gamma\gamma}<M_{H}-5\) GeV) is composed by 48 events:

* in 41 events (about 85% of the total) one of the two photons is a converted one (identified using the true MC information). Between these, about 40% are early converted photons (\(R_{c}<\) 20 cm), for which despite the use of a large 3 \(\times\) 7 cluster size, the photon energy is not well reconstructed, while another 40% are not identified as converted, that is converted photons for which a 3\(\times\)5 cluster is used (due to the 80% conversion reconstruction efficiency used in the analysis). For the remaining 20% events no significative problems has been identified.
* in the other 7 events (15%) the mass difference is due to a bad primary vertex reconstruction.

The high tail (for \(m_{\gamma\gamma}>M_{H}+5\) GeV) is composed by 16 events, the most of which (11 events) presents a bad primary vertex reconstruction. For the remaining events no significative problem is evident.

### Contributions to mass resolution

The variation of the mass resolution as a function of the Higgs boson mass is shown in Figure 27. Moreover, in Table 9 we report the mass resolutions calculated separately for events with: two unconverted photons, at least one converted photon, two photons in the barrel and with at least one photon in the end-cap.

The contribution to the H mass resolution coming from the photon energy and angular resolution are described in Equation 1. In turn each photon energy resolution can be espressed in a standard way as:

\[\frac{\sigma_{E}}{E}=\frac{a}{\sqrt{E}}\oplus\frac{b}{E}\oplus c, \tag{7}\]

where a, the stochastic term, is about 10% for the e.m. calorimeter, b, the noise term, is of the order of 300 MeV and c, the constant term, has been discussed in Section 4.

Table 10 shows the contributions to the mass resolution for various Higgs masses at low and high luminosity. The photons have been identified by using the truth information. The row called "Sampling term" includes the contributions of the reconstructed energy only (no pile-up, no noise and photon direction taken from the truth information). Then all events have been reconstructed by adding one effect at the time and the analysis repeated; the different contributions are obtained by subtraction. The term "pointing" has been estimated comparing the mass resolution calculated using the truth photon direction and the direction (using calorimeter information only) obtained with the procedure described in Sec. 6. We have estimated an error of roughly 100 MeV on these numbers by varying the fit intervals. As already recalled in Section 2, the electronic noise at low and high luminosity is the same as no optimal filtering is applied. The results obtained in the TDR at Higgs masses of 100 and 130 GeV are also listed [1]. The comparison shows an increase of the "sampling term" in the DC1 data mostly due to the increase in conversion rate and similar (within errors) contributions coming from "constant term" and "pointing." The contribution to the mass resolution coming from the electronic noise is higher in DC1 samples both at high and low luminosity as already noticed in Sec. 2.The contribution from pile-up at low luminosity cannot be directly compared because the TDR results were obtained for a luminosity of \(10^{33}\)cm\({}^{-2}\)s\({}^{-1}\) and the DC1 results assume a luminosity of \(2\cdot 10^{33}\)cm\({}^{-2}\)s\({}^{-1}\). The high-luminosity pile-up contribution is comparable between DC1 and TDR within the limits also discussed in Sec. 2.

## 8 Background Studies

The search for the \(H\to\gamma\gamma\) signal at the LHC will have to deal with two sources of background: the _irreducible_ background which is due to direct QCD genuine photons pair production and the _reducible_ background mainly due to jets that fake photons in the calorimeter. In the following sections these backgrounds will be briefly described.

### Reducible background

The reducible background comes from jet-jet and \(\gamma\)-jet events in which one or both jets are misidentified as photons. Since the production cross-sections for these processes are many order of magnitude larger than the signal cross section, the rejection of these backgrounds relies on photon/jet discrimination capabilities of the calorimeters. Jets

and photons can be separated by using the information of the hadronic and electromagnetic calorimeters as described in Section 5.

The \(\gamma\)/jet separation has been studied in detail in [1] and [10]: the obtained jet rejection factor is \(\sim 3000\) for \(E_{T}>40\) GeV. The reported calorimeters performance should allow to keep the contribution of the reducible background at the level of 20% of the total irreducible on the full relevant Higgs mass range as shown in [1].

In this analysis the reducible background has been calculated from the TDR numbers (Table 19.2 of Ref. [1]). The numbers have been rescaled by the ratio of the mass window used in this analysis to the one used in the TDR (which are different due to the differences in mass resolution).

### Irreducible background

The irreducible background consists of genuine photons pairs produced via the following LO processes: Born (\(q\bar{q}\to\gamma\gamma\)), box (\(gg\to\gamma\gamma\)) and quark bremsstrahlung (\(qg\to q\gamma\to q\gamma\gamma\)).

In this note we present results obtained using the TDR cross sections and structure functions (for comparison) and results obtained using more recent evaluations. For both TDR and DC1 analyses the irreducible background has not been fully simulated.

The differential \(d\sigma/dM_{\gamma\gamma}\) cross sections for the irreducible background events passing the kinematic cuts described in Section 7 (\(\eta\) and \(p_{T}\) acceptances, 80% efficiency on photon identification) are reported in Table 11 as (Born + box)\(\times 1.5\), where the 1.5 factor takes into account the quarkbremsstrahlung. The DC1 numbers have been taken from [8].

The number of background events has been obtained by integrating the differential cross section in the mass window used to evaluate the number of signal events.

## 9 Signal Significance

Using the results of Sections 7 and 8 the Higgs signal significance has been calculated for Higgs masses of 100, 120, 130 and 140 GeV. Results are presented for an integrated

These numbers have been obtained from PYTHIA 5.7 with CTEQ2L structure function set for TDR and with PYTHIA 6.203 and CTEQ5L for DC1 [8].

luminosity of 30 fb\({}^{-1}\) (collected at \(2\cdot 10^{33}\) cm\({}^{-2}\) s\({}^{-1}\)) and for 100 fb\({}^{-1}\) (collected at \(10^{34}\) cm\({}^{-2}\) s\({}^{-1}\)). The number of signal events has been obtained using the cross section of Table 1 and the acceptances in the mass bin (as [-1.4\(\sigma\),+1.4\(\sigma\)], where \(\sigma\) is the mass resolution) of Table 5, 6, 7 and 8. Events from WH, ZH and \(t\bar{t}\)H channels have not been simulated and so in the present analysis the expected numbers of signal events from associated production have been obtained rescaling from the TDR numbers (Table 19.2 of Ref. [1]). The numbers have been rescaled by the ratio of the mass window used in this analysis to the one used in the TDR (which are different due to the differences in mass resolution).

First of all, a comparison as close as possible to the TDR results has been attempted. The same TDR Higgs and background production cross sections and branching ratios have been used. The results are presented in Table 12. A small degradation in the signal significance ranging from 3% to 6% according to the Higgs mass is observed.

Our new signal analysis results using up-to-date cross sections and branching ratios and using the calorimeter information to identify the Higgs photons are summarized in Table 13 (low luminosity and event vertex reconstructed using the Inner Detector),Table 14 (low luminosity and event vertex reconstructed from calorimeter information only) and Table 15 (high luminosity and event vertex reconstructed from calorimeter information only).

The ATLAS discovery potential in the \(H\rightarrow\gamma\gamma\) channel as a function of the Higgs boson mass is shown in Figures 28 and 29.

As it can be seen, our results for an analysis a la _TDR_ show only a slight degradation of signal significances with respect to the physics performance TDR (see Figure 28). The new analysis is comparable or slightly better than the TDR one due to the effect of the new cross-sections and to the optimized photon identification cuts. The Higgs peak over the expected background at high luminosity is shown in Figure 30 for M\({}_{H}=120\) GeV.

## 10 Effect of dead HV sectors

In order to study the effect on physics results of detector inefficiencies, the impact on the \(H\rightarrow\gamma\gamma\) discovery potential of high voltage system failures in the electromagnetic calorimeter has been investigated. This work is a first step of a more general activity aimed to include in the simulation all detector inefficiency discovered during the assemblying and commissioning phase.

As long as the high voltage distribution is concerned, the barrel calorimeter is divided into 448 sectors, each one spanning a 0.2\(\times\)0.2-wide region in the \(\eta-\phi\) space. Each HV sector contains 32 electrodes that make 64 liquid argon semigaps (between the 32 absorber) which are identified as 32 _high_ and 32 _low_ semigaps. The two set of semigaps are powered by two independent HV line so that if one of the two lines fails, the energy collected by 32 semigaps is still available. In some cases due to problems encountered during assembling and cabling this simple picture has been modified by splitting each sector in smaller units or by isolating single (problematic) electrodes on dedicated HV lines. These effects are not accounted for in the present analysis. In the endcap outer wheel (the inner wheel which extends from \(\eta\)=2.5 to \(\eta\)=3.2 is not used in this analysis) there are also 448 HV sectors: their \(\phi\) granularity is still 0.2 units while along \(\eta\) they are 0.1 or 0.2 wide, depending on the \(\eta\) position.

During the data taking the high voltage system could be forced to work in critical conditions. The possible failures in increasing gravity are:

* Some sectors (or half sectors) might require to be operated at reduced voltage;
* Some sectors might have only 32 half gaps biased at nominal voltage (and the other 32 semigaps kept at 0 V);
* Some sectors might be fully dead due to shorts on both side of the electrodes, which do not allow to put any voltage on neither set of gaps.

In this study it has been decided to consider only the worst possible case: the \(H\rightarrow\gamma\gamma\) analysis (\(M_{H}\) = 120 GeV with electronic noise and no pile-up) has been repeated several times, each time with an increasing number of fully dead HV sectors (from 1 to 24) in the barrel and endcap calorimeters separately. The damaged sectors

have been choosen randomly. As in the offline release used for this study the HV sectors identifiers (which would have allowed to directly identify all the read-out cells belonging to a given HV sectors) were not available, an ad-hoc patch has been used. Given an HV sector, its nominal \(\eta\) and \(\phi\) boundaries have been considered and all the energies of the read-out cells in this range have been put to zero. This last step has been achieved by using a modified version of the routine _LArG3Escale_ (which, in its unpatched version, is responsible for the calibration of the calorimeter cells). An example of the \((\eta,\phi)\) barycenter positions of the electromagnetic clusters in \(H\rightarrow\gamma\gamma\) events with 6 HV dead sectors in the barrel is shown in Figure 31.

No correction has been studied for clusters near a dead HV sector and the background has been rescaled from the TDR. To be conservative the background estimate has not been corrected for the acceptance loss. The percentage loss of signal significance as a function of the number of dead HV sectors is shown in Figure 32.

In case of the failure of a few HV sectors (\(\leq 6\)), the signal significance degradation is of the order of \(\simeq 3\%\): this result shows that the \(H\rightarrow\gamma\gamma\) channel is expected to be quite robust against possible high voltage problems.

## 11 Conclusions

The analysis presented in this note on DC1 Montecarlo samples confirms the TDR results and shows that the Higgs boson discovery potential in the \(\gamma\gamma\) channel, for an Higgs boson mass between \(M_{H}=110\) and \(M_{H}=140\) GeV, remains well above \(3\sigma\) and \(5\sigma\) for 30 and 100 fb\({}^{-1}\) of integrated luminosity, respectively. Calorimeter based photon identification cuts optimized for low and high luminosity have been used.

Figure 31: Barycenter in the \((\eta,\phi)\) plane of all electromagnetic clusters reconstructed in the LAr calorimeter in about 10k events of \(H\rightarrow\gamma\gamma\) decays with 6 dead HV sectors in the barrel.

To compare with the TDR results, this analysis still makes use of LO calculation for signal and background. Moreover, the background has been calculated using the same method as in the TDR which it is known to be approximated.

The discovery potential has been tested against calorimeter high voltage system failures showing that a negligible degradation is expected for the assumption of about 2-3 HV dead sectors.

Electronic and pile-up noise in the LAr calorimeter

Figure 33 shows the behaviour, as a function of the read-out shaping time, of the electronic noise, the pile-up noise (at two different luminosities) and the total calorimeter noise. As the electronic noise would favour large shaping times while to reduce the pile-up contribution smaller shaping times would be required, a compromise has to be find between the two effects. In the LAr barrel calorimeter the shaping time of the signal has been chosen at 13 ns to minimize the total noise contribution (pile-up plus electronic noise) at the LHC design luminosity (10\({}^{34}\) cm\({}^{-2}\) s\({}^{-1}\)).

As it can be seen from the Figure, the chosen shaping time is not optimal at low luminosity. This effect can be partly recovered using optimal filtering. This is a software filtering technique that given the normalized shape of a signal, a set of signal samples and the autocorrelation noise matrix allows to optmize the signal-to-noise ratio. This corresponds, in the time domain, to varying the shaping time.

In the DC1 samples used in this note, the optimal filtering procedure could not be applied as only one sample (the peak sample) of the signal was available in the data files. By working at 13 ns shaping time at low luminosity too, the pile-up noise is underestimated. Moreover, in DC1 data the electronic noise was calculated from test-beam data after optimal filtering (which minimizes only the electronic noise as no pile-up was present) and applied both at high and low luminosity. This implies that:

* High luminosity. The electronic noise is underestimated because of the reduction due to having applied the optimal filtering to the test-beam noise. The pile-up noise is correct.
* Low luminosity. The electronic noise should be slightly underestimated (this is

\(|\eta|<1.8\) ("end-cap presampler"). The granularity of the read-out cells is \(\Delta\eta\times\Delta\phi=0.025\times 0.1\) in both cases.

## Appendix C Choice of cluster size in the end-cap

The cluster size in the barrel for unconverted photons has been chosen, according with the TDR studies [1], as a \(\Delta\eta\times\Delta\phi\) = 3 \(\times\) 5 window. In the end-cap, instead, where the cell size along \(\theta\) is smaller than in the barrel, a window of 5 \(\times\) 5 cells may give best performances.

To check this, the mass resolutions obtained with a cluster size of 3 \(\times\) 5 and 5 \(\times\) 5 in end-cap have been compared for uncovered photon samples.

Table 17 (top part) summarizes the results obtained using true photon \(\eta\) instead of the reconstructed \(\eta\); in this way the contribution to the mass resolution of the energy containment (which we want to study in this section) can be isolated from the one of direction reconstruction. As it can be seen, when the true photon direction is used, the energy reconstruction in end-cap improves by \(\sim\) 2% with a larger cluster size.

When the \(\gamma\) direction is reconstructed using the calorimeter information, the resolutions with the 5 \(\times\) 5 cluster become slightly worse. This is due to the fact that no ad hoc S-shape correction have been studied for cluster size of five cells in \(\eta\) during DC1 (they were studied only for cluster of three cells along \(\eta\)). This causes a degradation of the spatial resolution. If the position of the photon is reconstructed with a 3 \(\times\) 5 cluster, while a 5 \(\times\) 5 cluster is used for energy reconstruction, the mass resolutions improves. However, even in this case, a clear comparison between 3 \(\times\) 5 and 5 \(\times\) 5 cluster sizes is masked by fluctations in the mass fit and lack of statistics (see bottom of Table 17).

## Appendix D Correction for the photon shower position

For end-cap photons, in order to include the misalignment effect described in Sec. 6, the photon direction fit \(\chi^{2}\) (see Equation 4) is modified as follows:

\[\chi^{2}=\sum_{ji}w_{ji}(a_{j}z_{i}+b_{j}+\delta_{i}-R_{ji})^{2} \tag{8}\]

where \(i\) runs over the three layers used in the fit (including the vertex from Inner Detector or the nominal LHC vertex), \(j\) runs over all the Higgs photons in the end-cap, \(w_{ji}=1/\sigma_{ji}^{2}\) are the weighting coefficients and \(\delta_{i}\) are the misalignment factors needed.

Minimizing this quantity in \(a\), \(b\) and \(\delta\) is equivalent to solve a set of linear systems. The system to be solved to obtain \(\vec{\delta}\) is of the form:

\[M\vec{\delta}=\vec{c} \tag{9}\]

where \(M\) is a 4\(\times\)4 symmetric matrix, function of \(z_{i}\), \(R_{ji}\) and \(w_{ji}\). The \(M\) matrix has a double degeneracy, so there are only two indeped misalignment factors. The first degeneracy is obvious and corresponds to the invariance of the system under a global translations of the layers along the R axis. This corresponds to the possibility to choose an arbitrary origin: so we can be set \(\delta_{1}=0\) and refer the other misalignment to it. The second one corresponds to the fact that the \(\chi^{2}\) is invariant for a change, common to all photons, in the incident angle that amount to give to each layer an offset proportional to its distance from one of the layers. The invariance of the \(\chi^{2}\) under a change in photons angle is valid only in the limit of \(w_{ji}\) independet on that angle, that is approximately true.

So, setting two of the misalignment factors to zero, \(\vec{\delta}\) has been computed and reported in Table 18. Once \(\vec{\delta}\) has been obtained, the misalignment is included in the fit and the event-by-event determination of the photon direction proceeds as in Sec. 6.

## Appendix E Optimization of the barrel/endcap crack \(\eta\) cut

The TDR analysis sets the barrel/end-cap calorimeter crack cut at \(\Delta\eta=0.15\) centered at \(\eta=1.45\).

We have checked the optimum \(\eta_{min}\) and \(\eta_{max}\) of this cut keeping a fixed \(\Delta\eta\) and studying the effect on the Higgs mass resolution. The study has been performed at

low luminosity for different Higgs masses and the \(\gamma\) direction has been reconstructed using only calorimeter information.

The results are presented in Figure 34. All curves show a wide minimum at \(\eta=1.475\). Based on these results, the cut has been defined as \(1.40<\eta<1.55\). This cut has been applied in all the studies reported in this note.
