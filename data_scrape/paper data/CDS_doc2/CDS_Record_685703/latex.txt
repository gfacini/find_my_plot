**Abstract**

Various configurations of the hadronic end-cap calorimeter of ATLAS with different longitudinal structures, with fine and coarse back part, with different total thickness have been studied. The main criteria to choose between the configurations are the potentialities for jet energy measurement, in particular for jet energy resolution. The influence of azimuthal cracks between segments of the hadronic calorimeter has also been investigated.

Introduction

In August 1995 the workshop on the ATLAS hadronic end-cap calorimeter took place at Ringberg Castle [1]. During this workshop possible changes to the hadronic calorimeter as compared to the technical proposal of ATLAS [2] were proposed and discussed. The main goal of most of the changes was to decrease the cost of the calorimeter. To evaluate the influence of the proposed changes on the performance of the hadronic end-cap calorimeter, numerous studies were subsequently carried out.

This note summarizes the results of the studies, carried out for different configurations of the hadronic end-cap calorimeter from the point of view of the measurement of the jet energy.

It should be stressed, that the precise hadronic energy measurement is an important task of the hadronic calorimeter, but not the only one. To take the decision on the final configuration of the calorimeter, other performance characteristics have also been analysed. They are presented elsewhere [3].

## 2 Simulation and Analysis

### Simulation procedure

Studies of the energy measurement of jets in the ATLAS end-cap calorimeter are based on detailed Monte Carlo simulations, which are done in the framework of the standard ATLAS software.

Single d-quark jets of different energies are generated with the PYTHIA 5.7 program [4] at a pseudorapidity \(\eta=2.45\). This \(\eta\)-point corresponds to the centre of the end-cap region.

Most results presented in this note are obtained with the version of the ATLAS geometry, as it was available in 1994 ("old version of DICE" [5]). In this geometry a forward (backward) module of the hadronic end-cap calorimeter is positioned at \(427<z<617\) cm (\(\cdot 617<z<\cdot 427\) cm) with an outer radius of 200 cm and inner boundaries along the cones with \(\eta\)=3.2 (\(\eta\)=-3.2). The calorimeter consists of a set of homogeneous plates of copper of 25 mm thickness without azimuthal \(\varphi\)-cracks, separated by active layers of liquid argon (\(LAr\)) of 8 mm thickness. All plates are parallel and oriented perpendicular to the beam direction. There are 56 layers of liquid argon in each module. The active volume of the calorimeter is divided into cells with a transverse size of \(\Delta\eta\times\Delta\varphi=0.1\times 2\pi/64\) and 8 mm thickness.

The detector response to the final state particles from jets is simulated using the program GEANT 3.21 [6] with the FLUKA code for shower development.

Unlike the standard version of DICE, energy depositions in every cell of liquid argon are stored. This allows to produce different configurations of the hadronic calorimeter at the stage of the analysis.

### Analysing procedure

To switch from the deposited energy scale to the jet energy scale, calibration parameters have to be applied for the different parts of the calorimeter. To determine these calibration parameters, a standard procedure is applied, which minimizes the energy resolution with respect to the generated jet energy. The reconstructed jet energy in the \(i^{th}\) event is defined as

\[E_{i}=\sum_{j=1}^{M}C_{j}\cdot E_{ij},\]where \(E_{ij}\) denotes the energy deposited in the \(j^{th}\) part of the calorimeter in the \(i^{th}\) event, \(C_{j}\) the calibration parameters, \(M\) the number of parts of the calorimeter with different calibration parameters. The calibration parameters are determined by minimizing the following functional

\[F=\sum_{i=1}^{N}(E_{i}-E_{i}^{jet})^{2},\]

where \(E_{i}^{jet}\) is the energy of a jet in the \(i^{th}\) event, \(N\) the number of events.

Minimization is separately done for each initial jet energy \(E_{jet}\). Hence there are different sets of calibration parameters for each \(E_{jet}\). However, as shown in a previous ATLAS note [7] (where also more detailed information about the application of the procedure can be found), the energy dependence of the calibration parameters is rather weak. Calibration parameters are determined for the total volume of the end-cap calorimeters (both electromagnetic and hadronic). This volume includes all cells in the pseudorapidity interval \(1.5\leq\eta\leq 3.3\) and over the full azimuthal range \(0\leq\varphi<2\pi\). In the most simple case there are only two calibration parameters: one for the electromagnetic and one for the hadronic end-cap calorimeter. But it is also possible to use separate information about energy depositions in longitudinal compartments. In accordance with the ATLAS technical proposal [2] there are three such compartments in the electromagnetic and four in the hadronic calorimeter. Therefore seven calibration parameters can be used to reconstruct jet energy in the end-cap region.

To determine the energy resolution, Gaussian curves are fitted to the calibrated energy distributions in an interval of \(\pm 3\sigma\) around the peak value. The mean value \(E\) and the standard deviation \(\sigma\) from this fit are used to calculate the resolution \(\sigma/E\). The energy dependence of the resolution can be parametrized by the following two term formula:

\[\frac{\sigma}{E}(E_{jet})=\frac{P_{1}}{\sqrt{E_{jet}}}\oplus P_{2}, \tag{1}\]

with a sampling term \(P_{1}\) and a constant term \(P_{2}\).

If not specially mentioned, the results are obtained in the total end-cap volume. In addition some studies are also done for a restricted volume as determined from a jet algorithm. For the present studies the following jet finding algorithm is used: The reconstructed energy, defined after applying the calibration parameters, is stored in a 18\(\times\)64 matrix. This matrix covers the end-cap volume (\(1.5\leq\eta\leq 3.3\) and full azimuthal range). Its granularity equals to the transverse granularity of the hadronic end-cap calorimeter of \(\Delta\eta\times\Delta\varphi=0.1\times 2\pi/64\). For each event a jet axis with two angular coordinates \((\eta_{0},\varphi_{0})\) is determined by using a simple clustering algorithm. The energy of the jet is determined by summing energies of all cells with coordinates inside a circle with the centre \((\eta_{0},\varphi_{0})\) and the radius \(R=\sqrt{(\eta-\eta_{0})^{2}+(\varphi-\varphi_{0})^{2}}\). The radius \(R\) is a measure of the accepted jet cone size. As shown in note [7], in this case the energy dependence of the jet energy resolution cannot be described by the two term formula (1). It is necessary to use one more term, which takes into account the lateral energy losses due to the finite jet cone size:

\[\frac{\sigma}{E}(E_{jet})=\frac{P_{1}}{\sqrt{E_{jet}}}\oplus P_{2}\oplus\frac {P_{3}}{E_{jet}}. \tag{2}\]Possible Changes of the Calorimeter

### Change of the longitudinal structure

Each module of the hadronic end-cap calorimeter consists of two wheels. A front (back) wheel has 24 (32) layers of liquid argon. In the "standard" configuration of the hadronic end-cap calorimeter, as described in the ATLAS technical proposal [2], cells of liquid argon are grouped longitudinally into four compartments in such manner that they contain 8, 16, 16 and 16 cells respectively. In the following such a longitudinal structure is denoted as "8/16/16/16".

From the point of view of electronics a readout cell corresponds to a cell of liquid argon, a readout channel to a longitudinal compartment. Preamplifiers are connected with individual cells. The signals from a corresponding number of preamplifiers (8 or 16) are summed up by a "summing and shaping amplifier" to form a signal of a readout channel. A decrease of the number of longitudinal segments results in a decrease of the number of readout channels and thereby in a significant reduction of the cost of the hadronic calorimeter. In this section the influence of such a reduction on the energy resolution of the calorimeter and on the maximum amount of energy contained in a readout channel is studied.

For these studies jets are simulated at a pseudorapidity \(\eta=2.45\) at six different energy points: 40, 100, 200, 500, 1000 and 2000 GeV. This corresponds to transverse energies of 7, 17, 34, 86, 171 and 343 GeV respectively. Each sample contains 1000 events.

#### 3.1.1 Energy resolution

In Table 1 the sampling and constant terms of the energy resolution, obtained for the total end-cap volume after applying the procedure described in Section 2.2, are presented for different configurations of the end-cap calorimeters. Each configuration is marked by the number of longitudinal compartments in the hadronic calorimeter (\(HA\)) with the corresponding number of liquid argon cells per compartment given in brackets, and by the number of longitudinal compartments in the electromagnetic end-cap calorimeter (\(EM\)). Compared to the standard configuration, the structure with only two parts (the hadronic calorimeter as one compartment and the electromagnetic calorimeter as the other one) evidently has a worse constant term \(P_{2}\). For all other presented configurations with three samples in the electromagnetic part no significant difference is observed.

The same behavior is demonstrated in Fig. 1, where the ratio of the energy resolution for a selected configuration to the resolution for the standard one is plotted as a function of the

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|c|} \hline Configuration & \(P_{1}\), \% \(\sqrt{\,GeV}\) & \(P_{2}\), \(GeV\) & \(\chi^{2}/\,ND\,F\) \\ \hline \hline \(4\,HA\,(8/16/16/16)\,+\,3EM\) & 48.6 \(\pm\) 0.9 & 0.78 \(\pm\) 0.08 & 1.7 \\ \hline \(1\,HA\,(56)\,+\,1EM\) & 48.9 \(\pm\) 0.9 & 1.02 \(\pm\) 0.07 & 0.8 \\ \(1\,HA\,(56)\,+\,3EM\) & 48.6 \(\pm\) 0.9 & 0.83 \(\pm\) 0.08 & 1.1 \\ \(2\,HA\,(24/32)\,+\,3EM\) & 48.4 \(\pm\) 0.9 & 0.88 \(\pm\) 0.07 & 1.9 \\ \(3\,HA\,(16/16/24)\,+\,3EM\) & 48.7 \(\pm\) 0.9 & 0.81 \(\pm\) 0.08 & 2.7 \\ \(3\,HA\,(8/16/32)\,+\,3EM\) & 48.0 \(\pm\) 0.9 & 0.89 \(\pm\) 0.07 & 0.9 \\ \hline \end{tabular}

initial jet energy.2

Footnote 2: It is known, that using FLUKA as a code for shower development yields a better energy resolution, than one may expect from experimental data. Therefore for the present studies not absolute values of the resolution, but the relative ones (in comparison with the standard configuration) are taken into account.

In conclusion from the point of view of the hadron energy resolution and ignoring pile-up any longitudinal structure of the hadronic end-cap calorimeter is acceptable (if the electromagnetic calorimeter has three compartments).

#### 3.1.2 Maximal energy range of readout channels

Another important characteristic influenced by changes of the longitudinal structure of the hadronic calorimeter is the maximal energy observed in the readout channels. It is necessary to ascertain that such changes do not impose additional requirements on the energy range with respect to the technical proposal [2].

The energy range is defined as the ratio between the maximally measured energy and the minimal energy. As the minimal energy the signal of a minimum ionizing particle (\(MIP\)) is taken. To determine the largest signals expected in the hadronic end-cap calorimeter for a single readout cell or channel, the above samples of jets are used. For each event the maximal signal observed in a cell of liquid argon or in a longitudinal compartment is determined. A cut is applied on this quantity in such a way that 99 % of the events are below this limit. This 99 % limit scales linearly with the jet energy from 40 GeV up to 2 TeV. Extrapolation is done to a maximum jet energy of 5 TeV. Also an additional safety factor of 1.23 is applied to take into account a possible increase of the maximal energy at pseudorapidities smaller than \(\eta\)=2.45, because of the increase of the geometrical size of cells.

In Table 2 the maximal energies for readout cells and channels as well as the \(MIP\)-energies for different longitudinal compartments of the hadronic end-cap calorimeter are presented. Also values of the variable \(Q=log_{2}(E_{MAX}/E_{MIP})\), which characterizes the energy range, are given there. All energy variables are in the "jet-scale" (i.e. after the calibration). According to this table the largest energy range of readout cells is about 13, of readout channels about 12.5. These maxima occur in the first longitudinal compartment.

Changes of the longitudinal structure of the hadronic calorimeter do not affect the energy range of readout cells, but can lead to the increase of this range for readout channels. In Fig. 2 the energy ranges of readout channels with the different number of cells are plotted as function of the position of the corresponding longitudinal compartments in the depth of the calorimeter. Independently of the position of a longitudinal compartment, consisting of 8 or more cells, the energy range of the corresponding readout channel is never greater than 12.5.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|c|c|c|c|} \hline Longitudinal & \multicolumn{3}{|c|}{Readout cell} & \multicolumn{3}{|c|}{Readout channel} \\ \cline{2-7} compartment & \(E_{MIP}\), GeV & \(E_{MAX}\), GeV & \(Q_{cell}\) & \(E_{MIP}\), GeV & \(E_{MAX}\), GeV & \(Q_{channel}\) \\ \hline \hline
1st (8 cells) & 0.044 & 356 & 13.0 & 0.352 & 1940 & 12.4 \\ \hline
2nd (16 cells) & 0.044 & 323 & 12.8 & 0.704 & 2780 & 11.9 \\ \hline
3rd (16 cells) & 0.044 & 139 & 11.6 & 0.704 & 1820 & 11.3 \\ \hline
4th (16 cells) & 0.044 & 59 & 10.4 & 0.704 & 713 & 10.0 \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 2: Minimal and maximal energies, energy ranges of readout cells and channels.

Therefore from the point of view of the energy range any longitudinal structure of the hadronic calorimeter with at least 8 cells per compartment can be accepted.

### Fine front and coarse back calorimeter

The maximum of the longitudinal energy profile of hadron showers lies in the front part of the calorimeter (see, as example, Fig. 2). It is necessary to have there rather precise measurements of the energy. On the other hand in the back part of the calorimeter, where mainly tails of showers are registered, the accuracy of the energy measurement may be worse. Such approach can be realized in the configuration of a calorimeter with a fine front wheel (24 sets of 25 mm copper plates and 8 mm liquid argon layers) and a coarse back wheel (16 sets of 50 mm copper plates, but again 8 mm liquid argon layers). This configuration allows to save money by significantly decreasing the number of readout cells and the number of preamplifiers, and also to save space in the end-cap region.

To study opportunities of this configuration from the point of view of the energy resolution, the same samples of events as in Section 3.1 are used. To simulate the double thickness of copper plates in the back wheel with respect to the standard configuration, the following procedure is used. In the back wheel (layers of liquid argon from 25 to 56) only energy depositions from layers with even numbers are taken into account to reconstruct energy. A longitudinal structure can be denoted in this case as "8/16/d16", where "d16" means, that this longitudinal compartment has double thickness of copper plates and consists of 16 layers of liquid argon.

In Fig. 3 the energy dependences of the resolution together with the results of the fit by the two term formula (1) are plotted for different longitudinal configurations of the hadronic calorimeter with a fine and with a coarse back part. No significant difference is observed. The same conclusion may be drawn from Fig. 4, where the ratio of the resolution for a selected configuration to the resolution for the standard one is plotted as a function of the initial jet energy.

Therefore from the point of view of the hadron energy resolution it is possible to have a coarser back part of the hadronic calorimeter with thicker absorber plates, but with the same thickness of liquid argon layers.

### Shorter calorimeter

One of the possible solutions to decrease the cost of a calorimeter is to make it shorter without changing the inner structure. The studies of the corresponding configurations are carried out using the same samples of simulated events as in the previous sections. For these studies six calibration parameters are applied to reconstruct energy: three for longitudinal compartments of the hadronic calorimeter and three for longitudinal compartments of the electromagnetic calorimeter. The longitudinal structure is "8/16/N" ("8/16/dN") for the hadronic calorimeter with a fine front and a fine back (a fine front and a coarse back) wheel, where a maximal value of \(N\) is 32 (16) for the full depth calorimeter. The studies of the energy resolution, presented in this section, are done for the total end-cap volume and for a jet volume with a jet radius \(R\)=0.7.

In Fig. 5 the ratio of the energy resolution for a fine back calorimeter with \(N\) liquid argon layers in the back wheel to the resolution for the full depth calorimeter is plotted as a function of \(N\). The plots are presented for different values of the initial jet energy. In Fig. 6 the same dependences are presented for a coarse back calorimeter. These figures demonstrate that a significant degradation of the resolution for shorter calorimeters takes place mainly at high energy jets (above 500 GeV). The reason of this behaviour is due to the longitudinal leakage from shorter calorimeters for energetic jets.

Such leakage should lead to an increase of the constant term of the energy resolution. To estimate this effect, the energy dependence of the energy resolution for the total volume (for the jet volume) are parametrized by the formula (1) ((2)) with only one free parameter -- the sampling term \(P_{2}\). The quality of the fit is controlled by the value of \(\chi^{2}\) which has been found to be acceptable for all studied configurations. In Fig. 7 the sampling term is plotted as a function of the number of liquid argon layers in the back wheel \(N\) for the total volume and for the jet cone of \(R\)= 0.7 for calorimeters with fine and coarse back wheels. Here dashed lines mark the value of the constant term for the full depth calorimeter, dotted lines mark the level of an additional (quadratically) contribution to the constant term of 0.5 %. This level is achieved already for fine calorimeters with 26-28 layers of liquid argon instead of 32 ones and for coarse calorimeters with 13 layers instead of 16.

In conclusion because of the fast degradation of the energy resolution, it is rather difficult to gain much in the cost and in the space by decreasing the total thickness of the hadronic end-cap calorimeter.

### Stainless steel instead of copper as absorber material

One of the possible changes of the hadronic end-cap calorimeter is to replace copper absorber plates with stainless steel ones (keeping the thickness of liquid argon layers the same). To study the proposed change, the special geometrical description with iron instead of copper is done in the framework of the "old version of DICE" [5]. Simulations are carried out for a few configurations of an iron calorimeter with different thickness of absorber plates. These configurations are selected in such a way that the total length of the calorimeter does not exceed the total length of the standard copper calorimeter. In addition the total thickness of an iron calorimeter in interaction length (\(\lambda_{I}\)) should not be less by more than 0.5 \(\lambda_{I}\) with respect to the copper one. The description of the configurations, selected for simulations, are presented in Table 3.

For each selected configuration 500 events with single d-quark jets with energy \(E_{jet}\)= 200 GeV are simulated at a pseudorapidity \(\eta\)=2.45 (\(E_{T}\)=34 GeV). According to the respective longitudinal structure a six parameter calibration is applied, the energy in the total end-cap volume is reconstructed and the energy resolution \(\sigma/E\) for each configuration is determined. The results are presented in Table 4, where the indices of the configurations correspond to the ones

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|} \hline  & & Total thickness \\ \cline{2-3} N & Configuration & _cm_ & \(\lambda_{I}\) \\ \hline \hline
0 & 56 \(\times\) 25 mm _Cu_ & 184.8 & 9.83 \\ \hline
1 & 44 \(\times\) 34 mm _Fe_ & 184.8 & 9.35 \\
2 & 31 \(\times\) 51.5 mm _Fe_ & 184.5 & 9.82 \\
3 & 24 \(\times\) 69 mm _Fe_ & 184.8 & 10.11 \\ \hline
4 & 24 \(\times\) 32 mm _Fe_ + 16 \(\times\) 47.5 mm _Fe_ & 184.8 & 9.50 \\
5 & 32 \(\times\) 32 mm _Fe_ + 8 \(\times\) 63 mm _Fe_ & 184.8 & 9.50 \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}

in Table 3. The energy resolutions obtained for 200 GeV jets with iron calorimeters (except configuration 3 with thick plates) are rather close to each other and to the resolution obtained for the copper calorimeter.

To study this question more thoroughly, it is better to analyse the energy dependence of the resolution. Due to lack of time investigations have only been performed for the iron calorimeter in the configuration 4 (see Table 3). For this configuration additional events with 100, 500 and 1000 GeV jets at \(\eta\)=2.45 were simulated (500 events per energy point). The energy dependence of the resolution together with the results of the fit by the formula (1) for the copper and for the selected iron calorimeter are plotted in Fig. 8. The sampling terms are rather close within errors, but the constant term is worse for the iron calorimeter, than for the copper one. The ratio of the corresponding resolutions as a function of the initial jet energy is plotted in Fig. 9. This figure demonstrates the degradation of the resolution for high energy jets for the iron calorimeter.

The results obtained show the advantage of a copper calorimeter from the point of view of the energy resolution.

### Influence of \(\varphi\)-cracks

According to the ATLAS technical proposal [2] each wheel of the hadronic end-cap calorimeter consists of 32 equal azimuthal segments. Between copper plates of different segments there is a crack with thickness \(S_{crack}\)=1 mm.3 This azimuthal crack is projective: both wheels of a hadronic end-cap module have it at the same \(\varphi\). During the discussions in Ringberg (see [1]) two proposals, concerning \(\varphi\)-cracks, were made: 1) to rotate the back wheel with respect to the front one to avoid the projectivity of the crack; 2) to increase the lateral size of the segments by a factor two to have 16 segments per a wheel. The results of the studies to estimate the influence of \(\varphi\)-cracks and the necessity of the proposed changes are presented in this section.

Footnote 3: From the point of view of the active liquid argon volume this crack is wider by 1 mm (0.5 mm on each side) due to high voltage safety. This difference is always taken into account during simulations, done for different values of the crack between absorber plates.

Unlike all previous studies, investigations of azimuthal cracks are based on simulations, done in the framework of DICE-95 [8]. The geometrical description of the hadronic calorimeter there is very close to reality: cracks in absorber and active volumes, electrodes in liquid argon and so on. There is no relative rotation of wheels in this geometry. The number of \(\varphi\)-segments in each wheel is 32. Azimuthal positions of cracks are multiple of \(2\pi/32\). Five different configurations of the hadronic calorimeter are used for simulations: with the crack thickness \(S_{crack}\)=0, 0.5,

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|c|l|c|} \hline N & Longitudinal structure & Resolution \(\sigma/E\), \% \\ \hline \hline
0 & 3_H A_(8/16/d16) + 3_EM_ & 3.7 \(\pm\) 0.1 \\ \hline
1 & 3_H A_(8/16/20) + 3_EM_ & 3.5 \(\pm\) 0.2 \\
2 & 3_H A_(8/8/15) + 3_EM_ & 3.9 \(\pm\) 0.2 \\
3 & 3_H A_(8/8/8) + 3_EM_ & 4.3 \(\pm\) 0.2 \\ \hline
4 & 3_H A_(8/16/16) + 3_EM_ & 3.6 \(\pm\) 0.2 \\
5 & 3_H A_(16/16/8) + 3_EM_ & 3.7 \(\pm\) 0.2 \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}

1, 2 and 5 mm. The longitudinal structure of the hadronic calorimeter is the standard one. Single d-quark jets with an energy of 500 GeV at a pseudorapidity \(\eta\)=2.45 (\(E_{T}\)=86 GeV) have been generated. Finally six different samples of events are simulated for the analysis. Characteristics of these samples are given in Table 5. Events from the first sample (with the standard 1 mm crack and the isotropic azimuthal distribution of jets) are used to determine calibration parameters. This sample is called the basic one in this section. Two different calibrations are applied for these studies: the seven parameters calibration \(4\,H\,A(8/16/16/16)+3EM\) and the two parameters calibration \(1H\,A(56)+1EM\). Investigations are done for the total end-cap volume and for the jet volume with \(R\)=0.5.

In Fig. 10 the reconstructed energy distributions, obtained with the seven parameters calibration, are plotted for different samples of events. With the increase of the crack thickness, the the shape of the distributions does not change and the number of events in the tails does not increase dramatically. Gaussian curves are fitted to these distributions, and the mean values of the energy \(<E>\) are determined for different samples. In Fig.11 the dependence of these values on the azimuthal crack thickness is plotted. The corresponding values with error corridors for the basic sample are marked by lines in the plots. One may expect that with increasing crack thickness the average value of the reconstructed energy should decrease, because of the leakage. But this effect is not observed at all. This means that the contribution to the \(E_{T}^{min}\) measurement of the leakage in the \(\varphi\)-cracks of absorber of the hadronic calorimeter is negligible.

The influence of azimuthal cracks on the energy resolution is shown in Fig.12. Some degradation of the resolution is observed for the calorimeter with 5 mm cracks, especially where the jet volume is restricted. For the proposed configuration with 1 mm cracks, the resolution values are fully consistent with the values obtained for configurations with smaller crack size.

All these results show, that the influence of the azimuthal cracks as proposed in [2] is very close to that which one may expect for a configuration with smaller crack values. From this point of view it is not necessary to undertake special efforts to diminish this influence.

## 4 Conclusions

The results of the studies carried out for different configurations of the hadronic end-cap calorimeter from the point of view of the energy measurement allow to draw the following conclusions.

Without loosing potentialities for accurate measurements of the hadronic energy in the end-cap region, it is possible to decrease the number of longitudinal segments of the hadronic

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|} \hline \multicolumn{3}{|c|}{Sample of events} & Number of \\ \hline N & \(S_{crack}\), \(mm\) & \(\varphi_{jet}\) & events \\ \hline \hline
1 & 1.0 & \(0-2\pi\) & 200 \\ \hline
2 & 0.0 & \(0-2\pi\) & 200 \\
3 & 0.5 & \(\pi\) & 100 \\

calorimeter (and therefore to decrease the number of readout channels), to make the back part of the calorimeter more coarse than the front part by increasing the thickness of the absorber plates and decreasing the number of liquid argon layers (and hence to decrease the number of preamplifiers and to save space in end-caps).

A replacement of copper plates by stainless steel ones as well as shortening of the hadronic calorimeter lead to a degradation of the energy resolution.

The influence of azimuthal cracks between plates of absorber is small and does not force to take additional efforts to diminish it.
