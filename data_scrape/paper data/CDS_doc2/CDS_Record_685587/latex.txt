**Abstract:**

The 50 \(\mu\)m gold-plated tungsten (W/Re LUMA, Sweden) anode wire in drift tubes of chambers to be used for detecting muons in ATLAS is held under tension at the endplug of each tube. We report studies to determine whether pre-tensioning of the wire produces any long-term differences in the decrease of wire tension with time.

**Introduction and Procedures:**

The anode wires in drift tubes of ATLAS chambers are to be held, typically, at 380 g tension. To minimize changes in field structure as a function of time, as well as the dependence on the location of any chamber (from the impact of gravity), it is important to maintain the wires under the initial tension. It has been reported recently [1] that, through a brief pre-tensioning of a wire with a force well above the final operating value, an improvement can be achieved in the length of time that the wire remains under proper tension. The present study was initiated in order to obtain more data on the long-term effect of such pre-tensioning. Ten 100 cm long wires were epoxied to an aluminum bar, as shown in the accompanying sketch (Fig. 1). Half were pre-tensioned for five minutes to 450 g and then glued at the nominal 380 g, while the remaining five were glued in position without pre-tensioning. (About 3 cm long layers of epoxy were used to hold the wires.) The wire tension was then measured at regular intervals over a period of 22 months, as described below.

The wires were positioned close to a small magnetic strip, and an AC voltage signal was pulsed through the wire to produce small mechanical oscillations. The frequency of the AC input was increased until the first mechanical resonance was observed on the wire. An Infra-Red (IR) "reflecting" photo-diode (Siemens SFH 900) was used as the means for detecting the resonance condition. It consisted of an IR source and a photo-transistor that was sensitive to the light reflected from the wire [2]. The output from the detector was monitored on an oscilloscope. At resonance, the reflection, and consequently the output signal from the detector, was at a maximum, with the resonant frequency (\(\nu_{{}_{R}}\)) related to the force of tension (\(T\)) in the wire as follows [3]:

\[\nu_{{}_{R}}=(1/2L)[T/\rho A]^{1/2}\]where L is the length of the wire, \(\rho\) its density, and \(A\) its transverse area. The detector can be positioned under any desired wire, and the contacts for the AC input signal to different wires can be changed very easily.

**Results of the Studies**

The ten wires were glued into position in late October 1995, and their response measured starting about three weeks thereafter. The initially observed tensions were found to be dispersed between about 310 and 390 g. The spread was thought to be due to the fact that the masses used for tensioning were not hanging freely under gravity. (That was not the case during the 5 minutes of pre-tensioning time.) This dispersion was not considered debilitating, because the main concern was in the long-term difference of the dependence of the tension on time for wires with and without pre-tensioning. (In fact, such dispersion can, in principle, be used to gauge the best amount of required pre-stressing.) The data for the observed resonant frequencies as a function of measuring date are given in Tables 1 for the normal wires (1-5) and for the pre-tensioned wires (6-10). The

measurements were performed at room temperature (mainly between 20 and 22 \({}^{o}C\)), but the temperatures were recorded in order to be able to correct the data for small effects from thermal expansion and the consequent changes in tension and in \(\nu_{{}_{R}}\). (For a Young's modulus of \(3.5\times 10^{5}\) N/mm\({}^{2}\) for W/Re wire, there is an expected increase in \(\Delta\nu_{{}_{R}}/\nu_{{}_{R}}\) of \(\sim 0.2\%\) per \({}^{o}C\) rise in temperature.) Usually, two measurements were taken for each wire, and we provide both of these to indicate the reproducibility of the technique. The observed differences between the two supposedly identical measurements were at times substantially greater than the expected impact of temperature variation. We therefore present the results of our analysis both with and without correcting for the small changes in recorded temperature.

**Discussion and Conclusions:**

The measurements given in Table 1 indicate that the creep and change in tension over almost two years was very small indeed. We therefore assumed a linear dependence of the frequency on time in our analysis of each wire, extracted the individual fitted slopes, and averaged the results separately for the pre-tensioned and not pre-tensioned wires, both with and without applying temperature corrections. The results for the mean slopes without temperature corrections of \((0.46\pm 0.23)\times 10^{-3}\) Hz/day and \((2.51\pm 0.36)\times 10^{-3}\) Hz/day, respectively for the pre-tensioned and not pre-tensioned wires, are somewhat larger than the results obtained without temperature corrections: \((0.14\pm 0.22)\times 10^{-3}\) Hz/day and \((2.21\pm 0.36)\times 10^{-3}\) Hz/day. However, independent of temperature corrections, the wires that were pre-tensioned did not show any significant creep, and we quote an upper limit, at 95% confidence, of \(<0.5\%\) per year for the change in tension without temperature corrections, and of \(<0.3\%\) per year when corrections are applied. For the wires that were not pre-tensioned, there is significant creep, which depends only somewhat on whether the temperature corrections are implemented: \(1.3\pm 0.2\%\) change in tension per year without temperature corrections, and \(1.1\pm 0.2\%\) with temperature corrections.

The observed level of creep is consistent with what would be expected [1]. Of course, the question of main interest is how these measurements extrapolate to 10-20 years from now. Because the effect is so small, any extrapolations are highly sensitive to the functional form used for this purpose. Nevertheless, because pre-tensioning appears to provide a significantly smaller probability for measurable creep, it would seem advisable to pre-tension the anode wires.
