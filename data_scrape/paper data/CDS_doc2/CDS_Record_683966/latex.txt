## 1 Introduction

The reconstruction of the \(\,{\rm K}^{0}_{\rm s}\rightarrow\pi^{+}\pi^{-}\,\) decays is difficult due to the long lifetime of the \(\,{\rm K}^{0}_{\rm s}\,\), which leads to the two pion tracks with reduced numbers of precision hits in the innermost sub-detectors and large impact parameters.

This decay was originally studied in [1] and successively for the work that was included in the ATLAS Technical Proposal [2]. The analysis was then updated with the latest design of the Inner Detector for the Inner Detector Technical Design Report [3] and finally for the ATLAS Detector Overview and Physics Performance TDR [4]. In this note we give more details about this last analysis.

The study reported in [3] was performed using single \(\,{\rm K}^{0}_{\rm s}\,\)'s of fixed \(\,{\rm p}_{\rm T}\,\)(3, 5 and 7 GeV), distributed uniformly in the pseudorapidity interval \(\,|\,\eta\,|\,\leq\,\)2.5. Due to the importance of \(\,{\rm K}^{0}_{\rm s}\,\) reconstruction for B physics and, in particular, for the decay \(\,{\rm B}^{0}_{\rm d}\rightarrow\rm\rm\rm\rm\rm\rm\rm\rm\rm\,/\psi K^{0}_{\rm s}\,\)[5], the reconstruction has now been studied in the context of this decay. Moreover, a different definition of efficiency (from that used in [3]) which can be used more directly in the analysis of \(\,{\rm B}^{0}_{\rm d}\rightarrow\rm\rm\rm\rm\,/\psi K^{0}_{\rm s}\,\) events is used. The study has been performed in the absence of pile-up.

## 2 Selection cuts

The analysis was performed using 15,000 \(\rm B_{d}^{0}\) \(\rightarrow\) J/\(\psi\)K\({}_{\rm s}^{0}\) events generated with PYTHIA and fully simulated in the Inner Detector using GEANT (dice97_6 and atgen97_3). The generated \(\rm K_{s}^{0}\) are decayed inside PYTHIA: this implies that the \(\rm K_{s}^{0}\) efficiency will be slightly overestimated as long-lived \(\rm K_{s}^{0}\) interactions in the Inner Detector material are not simulated. The average \(\rm p_{T}\) of the \(\rm K_{s}^{0}\)'s is 6.3 GeV as shown in Figure 1 for generated \(\rm K_{s}^{0}\) after a J/\(\psi\) has been reconstructed (with cuts looser than the ones listed in [5]).

Charged tracks were reconstructed using xKalman [6], down to a minimum \(\rm p_{T}\) of 0.5 GeV/c for \(|\) \(\eta\) \(|\) \(\leq\) 2.5. The analysis was similar to the one performed in [3], except that a minimum of six precision hits is now required in the pattern recognition. The algorithm for finding \(\rm K_{s}^{0}\)'s looped on all pairs of oppositely charged tracks in the event and fitted them in 3D to a common vertex. It was required that the \(\chi^{2}\) per degree of freedom be less than six. Pion masses were assigned to both tracks and the invariant mass calculated. Track pairs were retained if the invariant mass was within 3\(\sigma\) of the nominal mass. Finally, to reduce the prompt track combinatorial background, the reconstructed transverse decay radius of the candidate was required to be greater than 1 cm. The selection cuts are summarized in Table 1.

To be compatible with the \(\rm sin2\beta\) analysis, as already recalled, all events were subjected to trigger and selection cuts similar to the ones used in the \(\rm B_{d}^{0}\) \(\rightarrow\) J/\(\psi\)K\({}_{\rm s}^{0}\) analysis to select a J/\(\psi\) sample.

\end{table}

The cuts on the decay radius and on the minimum number of hits used to select \(\mathrm{K^{0}_{s}}\) candidates effectively defined a fiducial region inside the Inner Detector in which decay vertices could be reconstructed: 1 \(<\) R \(<\) 37 cm and \(\mathrm{|\,z\,|}<\) 210 cm, where R is the transverse decay radius and z the vertex coordinate along the beam direction. The reconstruction efficiency was defined as the fraction of events with a reconstructed 1/\(\psi\) where the true pions from the \(\mathrm{K^{0}_{s}}\) decay were correctly reconstructed and satisfied the selection cuts. The total efficiency is 41.1% which includes (see Table 2): the acceptance for \(\mathrm{K^{0}_{s}}\)'s which decay inside the fiducial region (68.6%), the xKalman reconstruction efficiency for the two pion tracks (76.9%) and the effect of the selection cuts on the reconstructed candidates (77.8%).

It is worth observing that the \(\mathrm{K^{0}_{s}}\) efficiency results obtained in this section and in the following ones depend (mainly because of the fiducial region cut) on the \(\mathrm{p_{T}}\) of the \(\mathrm{K^{0}_{s}}\) and hence on the characteristics of the production mechanism. This implies that the results obtained in this note for the \(\mathrm{B^{0}_{d}\to J/\psi K^{0}_{s}}\) sample cannot apply automatically to another \(\mathrm{K^{0}_{s}}\) sample.

## 3 \(\mathrm{K^{0}_{s}}\) efficiency study

In the previous paragraph, the \(\mathrm{K^{0}_{s}}\) reconstruction efficiency has been divided into three contributions: the acceptance, the pattern recognition and the offline cut selection. In this paragraph we will study these contributions in more detail, focusing on the contribution of the pattern recognition to the overall efficiency.

The acceptance efficiency is set by the Inner Detector geometrical layout. The request that charged pions leave enough hits in the precision measurement layers in order to be reconstructed by the pattern recognition program defines a fiducial cylinder in the Inner Detector volume in which \(\mathrm{K^{0}_{s}}\) have to decay. Once a minimal number of precision hits has been decided in xKalman, the acceptance is determined. Moreover we further reduce the acceptance by requiring the decay radius to be greater than 1 cm.

The third contribution (offline cuts) required a study of the background under the \(\mathrm{K^{0}_{s}}\) and \(\mathrm{B^{0}_{d}}\) peaks to be optimized. The present study uses cuts optimized for the analysis of [5].

The reconstruction efficiency is studied for tracks matching the generated one. The matching between the reconstructed track and the Monte-Carlo one is made using the Kine-word which requires that the generated track contributed to the majority of the precision hits in the reconstructed one. It has to be noticed that SemiConductor Tracker (SCT) hits are treated as single view hits (so that each SCT layer may account up to two precision hits) whereas a pixel hit, giving pseudo-3D information, accounts for one precision hit. Under default operating conditions (at low luminosity), xKalman requires a minimum of seven precision hits to reconstruct a track. At high luminosity (and in particular for the b-tagging analysis) it is usually run with a minimum of nine precision hits. In this analysis, due to particular characteristics of \(\mathrm{K^{0}_{s}}\) pions already recalled, it has been tried to run xKalman with a reduced number of hits (while keeping an acceptable level of background). Track reconstruction efficiency depends on the minimum number of precision hits required in the pattern recognition but nevertheless the overall \(\mathrm{K^{0}_{s}}\) efficiency seems not to be strongly affected by changing from seven to four hits as shown in Table 2. Relaxing the requirement on the number of precision hits increases the acceptance (first row of Table 2) but on the other hand reduces the quality of the reconstruction (second and third row of Table 2) giving no net gain. As a compromise between these two opposite constraints (and on the basis of the analysis of [5]) it was decided to run with a minimum of six hits. This choice provides an overall efficiency of 41.1%.

## 4 Efficiency, mass and decay radius resolutions

The definition of efficiency used in this work is different from that previously used in [3] but more useful for the study of the reconstruction of the \(\mathrm{B_{d}^{0}\to J/\psi K_{s}^{0}}\) decay. In the Inner Detector TDR, the efficiencies were normalised to decays within the fiducial region for which the tracks were reconstructed (\(\mathrm{1\leq R\leq 44\;cm}\)) and therefore did not include the geometrical acceptance; moreover the number of reconstructed \(\mathrm{K_{s}^{0}}\) was normalized to the number of \(\mathrm{K_{s}^{0}}\) for which the two decay pions were successfully reconstructed.

The total reconstruction efficiency is shown as a function of the pseudorapidity and of the decay radius in Figures 2 and 3, respectively. The efficiency as a function of \(\mathrm{K_{s}^{0}}\) pseudorapidity (Figure 2) shows a dip in the overlap region between the barrel and the end-caps. The reconstruction efficiency as a function of the decay radius (Figure 3) falls from a maximum of 75%when the \(K^{0}_{\rm s}\) decay is in the Pixel volume down to about 20% at the outer radius of the fiducial volume. A dip can be seen as well in the radius range corresponding to the gap between the last pixel layer and the first SCT layer. The \(K^{0}_{\rm s}\) reconstruction efficiency drops from about 75% down to about 40% in the range \(16<R<24\) cm. This loss of efficiency might be attributed to the difficulty to extrapolate the vertex position in this intermediate region and, maybe, to interactions in the services (see also next section).

Figures 5 and 5 show the mass and decay radius resolution as a function of the decay radius.

The mass resolution varies between 4.5 and 7 MeV in the fiducial volume. It is affected mainly by the reconstruction of pion momenta and angles which are well determined by the tracking layers beyond the decay vertex and hence are less sensitive to the position of the decay. Vice versa, the decay radius resolution depends strongly on the radius of the decay and is much better for decays just in front of the Pixel layers, but is worse for decays inside the SCT, which has poorer R\(\phi\) resolution, especially in the absence of R-z measurements from the Pixels.

## 5 Pion reconstruction inefficiencies

The reconstruction efficiency of the true pion tracks coming from the \(K^{0}_{\rm s}\) decay has been studied in more detail. One likely cause of the pion inefficiency could be the interaction with the material of the Inner Detector. To study this hypothesis a sample of 10,869 \(K^{0}_{\rm s}\) has been divided in three sub-samples according to the number of interactions of the decay daughters (no pion interacting, one pion interacting, both pions interacting) within the Inner Detector volume. Pion interactions are deduced by looking at the corresponding GEANT track: if the GEANT track terminates in a vertex, origin of one or more tracks, we will say that the pion has interacted. No attempt is done to understand the nature of the interaction (elastic, quasi-elastic, inelastic) and to see if the original pion is present among the tracks originating from the interaction vertex. The results (see Table 3) show that the reconstruction efficiency (acceptance times kine match efficiency) is higher if the pions do not interact with the Inner Detector material. If there were no interactions (firstrow of Table 3) the \(\mathrm{K}^{0}_{\mathrm{s}}\) efficiency would be reduced from 68.6% (acceptance from Table 2) to 60.3% just because of pattern recognition problems. The further drop to 55.0% (last row of Table 3) can be explained in terms of pion interactions.

To further check the hypothesis of a correlation between the pion interactions and the reconstruction efficiency, events with only one interacted pion were studied in more detail. The sample of 2,850 \(\mathrm{K}^{0}_{\mathrm{s}}\)\(\rightarrow\)\(\pi^{+}\pi^{-}\) events having one pion interacting was divided according to the number of pions matched to the generated one using the **kine**-word matching as shown in Table 4.

Among the events which have one pion interacting in the Inner Detector, about 37% have only one pion associated to a Monte-Carlo track. In 98% of the cases the non-reconstructed pion is the one which interacts.

Figures 6 shows the range covered by \(\mathrm{K}^{0}_{\mathrm{s}}\) pion before interacting. Pions without a **Kine**-match have a smaller range than pions successfully matched to a generated track. The position of the interaction point in R-z plane is shown in Figure 8, for both pions with and without a **Kine**-match. Non-reconstructed pions interact in the innermost layers of the Inner Detector while reconstructed pions interact much further away from the beam pipe.

The probability of pion interaction as a function of the pseudorapidity is shown in Figure 7: the plot shows that the probability is higher in the pseudorapidity range corresponding to the region in the Inner Detector where the amount of material is higher (at about \(\,|\,\eta\,|\,=1.8\)).

## 6 Conclusions

The reconstruction of the \(\mathrm{K}^{0}_{\mathrm{s}}\)\(\rightarrow\)\(\pi^{+}\pi^{-}\) decay in the Inner Detector has been studied in the framework of the analysis of the \(\mathrm{B}^{0}_{\mathrm{d}}\)\(\rightarrow\)\(\mathrm{J}/\nu\mathrm{K}^{0}_{\mathrm{s}}\) decay. The total \(\mathrm{K}^{0}_{\mathrm{s}}\) reconstruction efficiency, including acceptance, track reconstruction and selection cuts, is about 41%. The origin of the inefficiencies
