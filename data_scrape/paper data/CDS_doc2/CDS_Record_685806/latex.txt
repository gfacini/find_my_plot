## 1 Introduction

The short bunch crossing period of LHC, T=25 ns, and the high level of the environmental physics background present in the ATLAS experimental hall, poses stringent requirements to the first level muon trigger. In particular, fast detector and electronics response and tight time coincidences are essential to reduce the fake trigger rate and to correctly identify the bunch crossing associated to the triggered muon.

In this note we studied the timing performances of the barrel muon trigger system. In particular, the rate of wrong bunch crossing identification and the impact to the fake muon trigger rate are analysed.

## 2 Muon Trigger Layout

The Muon System Layout considered for this analysis is the layout version "L" ; see also figures 1, 2 and 3 [1]. This layout is, in pratics, equivalent to the more recent version "M" (where only the end-cap region is significantly changed).

The barrel trigger system is composed of two independent subsystems, the first located in the region z\(<\)0 and the second in the region z\(>\)0. Small and Large Sectors are made with 6 trigger chambers for each half-barrel subsystem and for all the three trigger stations. Each trigger station is then made with two RPC layers, both read in two orthogonal projections. The first and the second trigger stations are placed around the Middle MDT Station; the third trigger station is placed externally (internally) to the Large (Small) MDT Station.

The strip layout is crucial for the performance of the system and it is organized as follows: each trigger chamber is read out by conductive strips 30

to 38 mm wide with length equal to half the dimension of the station itself along the direction of the strip. In this way in each RPC chamber four "pad" regions can be defined by the overlap of two half-chambers of both views. The length of the strips parallel to the beam line, that we define here as "\(\phi\)-strips" is 84 cm to 108 for the large sectors and 48 cm to 108 for the small sectors; concerning the strips orthogonal to the beam line, the "\(\eta\)-strips", the length ranges from 172 cm to 242 cm (large sectors) and from 148 cm to 183 cm (small sectors).

The \(\phi\)-strips are read out from the chamber edges. In order to save electronics channels, pairs of \(\phi\)-strips belonging to the same \(\phi\) coordinate are read toghether through an OR-logic. We can define a "matrix-region" identified by two contiguous half-chambers. The first and the last half-chamber are not paired; therefore we have in total 7 "matrix regions" for the large chambers, as shown in figure 4[2]. The same is for the small chambers.

The strip-logic for the \(\eta\)-strips is simpler: each strip is read individually from the external edges.

This trigger layout is rigorously correct for the Large Chamber sectors; concerning the Small Chamber sectors, the 5th RPC chamber, 960 cm wide along the z-axis, is actually read-out by strips that cover the full dimension, while in the present study (for simplicity) pairs of independent strips (twice shorter) are assumed perform the read-out. The length of the strips involved being comparable with the one of the others, this simplification is expected to have minor impact on the results obtained.

## 3 The trigger algorithm

The trigger algorithm is described in several documents [3]. Essentially, strips of station 1 are put in coincidence with a set of strips of station 2 (for low-\(p_{T}\) trigger) and also of station 3 (to perform the high-\(p_{T}\) trigger). These coincidences are performed in the two projections to reduce the accidental trigger rate. The logic requires a 3/4 majority for the low-\(p_{T}\) trigger; in case of the high-\(p_{T}\) trigger a 1/2 majority is additionally required.

## 4 Simulation

The geometry above described has been implemented in a detailed Monte Carlo Program; the spe

ical sectors 11 and 12 [1] have not been considered in the present study. The program accounts for the effects summarized in figure 5:

* the bending of charged tracks in the inhomogeneous magnetic field produced by the muon toroids and the central solenoid;
* the coulomb scattering and the energy loss in the central calorimeter (energy losses fluctuations are not relevant and therefore have not been simulated);
* the width of the p-p interaction region, \(\sigma=5.5\) cm;
* the RP C intrinsic time jitter, modelled with a gaussian spread \(\sigma=1.5\) ns, according to experimental data [4];
* the signal propagation delay along the strip from the impact point of the particle to the strip edge read out by the FE electronics (\(v_{sign\,al}=22.2\) cm/ns);
* the time jitter due to the discriminator \(\sigma=0.50\) ns [5];
* the system phase adjustment method; this is described in detail in the next section;

cles; the minimum signal-to-signal overlap is fixed to 1 cycle (resolving time). This assumption is kept everywhere in this note. In the simple case of a two-plane coincidence for a single projection, the situation is sketched in in figure 6. The RPC analog signal (dashed curve) of plane 1 overcomes the discriminator threshold in the time interval t3-t4; as consequence, a digital signal is formed in t4 with width t4-t7. The signal length includes also the'resolving time', i.e. the minimum time interval needed to identify a coincidence between two (or more) digital signals. Similarly for plane 2, the figure shows the two signals in coincidence with the signal of plane 1, with the largest time difference from the signal of the first plane.

As it is possible to see, all hits detected in the time range from t1 to t 2 produce a time coincidence. The difference \(\Delta t_{c}=\)(t2-t1) gives the effective time gate that is used in fake trigger rate calculation programs.

In general this difference is \(\Delta t_{c}=(2*n-1)\times T_{int}\), where \(n\) is the signal width measured in interpolator clock cycles and \(T_{int}\) in the interpolator period.

For example, considering the situation of figure 6, the effective time gate if \(\nu_{int}=160\) MHz is \(\Delta t_{c}\)= 31.25 ns, while for for \(\nu_{int}=320\) MHz \(\Delta t_{c}\)= 21.88 ns, about 10 ns less. Both options are viable for the muon trigger, as discussed in section 7.3.

## 7 Results

The simulation program calculates for a given muon track, for each trigger station and projection, the time at which the signal enters the trigger logic electronics (see also figure 5). This time is counted from the vertex point and includes all the physics and instrumental effects previously dicussed. From this time, the nominal time-of-flight expected value plus the synchronization corrections (presented in the two tables of the System Synchronization chapter) are applied. Finally, the value obtained is "binned" in clock bins, simulating the function of the interpolator circuit. The result is an integer that gives the clock cycle number corresponding to appearance of the digital signal (actually the correct operation to do is to apply the timing corrections \(after\) the signal digitization; however the expected effect is small and will be evaluated in future studies).

The main purpose of this chapter is to evaluate the optimum signal width to be used for the coincidence and to verify the unambigous bunch crossing capability of the system.

The pulse width to be assigned to each RPC signal must be large enough to ensure full efficiency to safely trigger on prompt high energy muons. At the same time this width must be as small as possible to allow the background rejection. The pulse width depends on the trigger layout; in particular on the speed of the trigger detector, on the length of the collecting strips and on the accuracy of the timing system.

Sample of about 50k muon tracks have been generated with p\({}_{T}\) of 6 GeV/c and 20 GeV/c (\(|\eta|<1\)), for Large and Small muon sectors.

Digitized RPC signals are sorted in increasing recorded time and used for the study.

### Pulse width

First we consider the case of 20 GeV/c transverse momentum muons crossing the large chamber muon sector.

Fig. 7 shows the distribution, for both projection of the low-p\({}_{T}\) system, of the difference between the 3rd and the 1st recorded time. The interpolator frequency is \(\nu_{int}\)=160 MHz. The difference is evaluated in number of interpolator clock cycles.

On the basis of this plot, a full efficient time coincidence requires 3 clock cycles in case of \(\nu_{int}\)=160 MHz (including the resolving time; for the low-p

trigger coincidence 2 clock cycle is still acceptable). This corresponds to a pulse width of (25/4)*3 ns = 18.75 ns.

The same distribution for \(\nu_{int}\)=320 MHz is shown in figure 8. In this case 4 clock cycles are needed, corresponding to a 12.5 ns signal width. The loss of efficency is estimated to be less than \(3\times 10^{-5}\).

Concerning the high-p\({}_{T}\) trigger study, the low-p\({}_{T}\) processor result is put in coincidence with the fastest time recorded in the external trigger detector doublet (1/2 majority). The time signal of the low-p\({}_{T}\) is the time in which the majority 3/4 occurs. The difference between the low-p\({}_{T}\) majority time and the high-p\({}_{T}\) doublet majority, in absolute value, is plotted in figure 9 and figure 10 (for the two different interpolator frequencies).

As it can be seen, the conclusions achieved above for the low-\(p_{T}\) trigger on the trigger detector digital signal width can be extend to the full system, including therefore also the high-\(p_{T}\) trigger.

Finally, the time matching of the two projections has been also studied. Figure 11 shows the time difference (with sign), for the low-\(p_{T}\) system, between the \(\phi\)-view and the \(\eta\)-view. The result for

Figure 8: Time difference between the first and the 3rd recorded time for the low-p\({}_{T}\) trigger, for the \(\eta\) view (full line) and the \(\rho-\phi\) view (dashed line).The interpolator clock frequency is \(\nu_{int}=3\,20\) MHz.

Figure 7: Time difference between the 1st and the 3rd recorded time for the low-p\({}_{T}\) trigger, for the \(\eta\) view (solid line) and the \(\rho-\phi\) view (dashed line).The interpolator clock frequency is \(\nu_{int}=160\) MHz.

Figure 9: Time difference between the low-\(p_{T}\) time signal and the external doublet signal, for the high-\(p_{T}\) trigger (in absolute value); the \(\eta\) view (full line) and the \(\rho-\phi\) view (dashed line) results are shown. The interpolator clock frequency is \(\nu_{int}=160\) MHz.

the high-\(p_{T}\) is shown in figure 12. In both subsystems, a coincidence time of 3 clock cycles (=18.75 ns) leads to an event loss of less than 10\({}^{-4}\).

For both cases, \(\nu_{int}=\)160 MHz. If \(\nu_{int}\) is set to \(\nu_{int}\)= 320 MHz, the coincidence is shown in figure 13 and figure 14. A coincidence time of 3 clock cycles (=9.375 ns) allows an event loss of less than 10\({}^{-3}\).

Very similar results have been obtained for low-\(p_{T}\) muons and for the small muon chamber system.

### Bunch crossing identification

The bunch crossing identification is studied looking to the number of the clock cycle for which the coincidence is first satisfied. In case of the low-\(p_{T}\) system, this is the third time signal recorded temporal, out of the four available, as shown in figure 15 for \(\nu_{int}\)= 160 MHz (four cycles).

The interpolator clock cycles are numbered from 0. In case of the high-\(p_{T}\) trigger, this is the second time between the time signal provided by the low-\(p_{T}\) system and the one provided by the external doublet. The results are shown in figure 16. The transverse muon momentum was \(p_{T}\) = 20 GeV/c.

Figure 11: Time difference between the \(\phi\)-view and the \(\eta\)-view trigger signals (with sign) for the low-\(p_{T}\) system. The interpolator clock frequency is \(\nu_{int}\) = 160 MHz.

Figure 12: Time difference between the \(\phi\)-view and the \(\eta\)-view trigger signals (with sign) for the high-\(p_{T}\) system. The interpolator clock frequency is \(\nu_{int}\) = 160 MHz.

The interpolator clock frequency is \(\nu_{int}\) = 320 MHz.

Figure 13: Time difference between the \(\phi\)-view and the \(\eta\)-view trigger signals (with sign) for the low-\(p_{T}\) system. The interpolator clock frequency is \(\nu_{int}=320\) MHz.

Figure 15: Bunch crossing identification in the low-\(p_{T}\) system; \(\nu_{int}=160\) MHz. Because the 3 over 4 majority, the third time (clock cycle = 3) assigns the bunch-crossing number; this coincidence is also used with the external RPC doublet to perform the high-\(p_{T}\) trigger. Muons have been generated with \(p_{T}\)=20 GeV/c.

A safe bunch crossing identification requires that the assignment is given by a clock number in the range 0-3 if \(\nu_{int}=\)160 MHz, and in the range 0-7 if \(\nu_{int}=\)320 MHz. As it can be seen, out of about 50k muons traced, no wrong assignments have been observed. This leads to a probability per muon track of wrong bunch crossing assignment of less than \(3\times 10^{-5}\).

The bunch crossing identification for \(p_{T}=6\) GeV/c muons is shown in figure 17; only a small tail is observed above clock number 3 (for \(\nu_{int}=\)160 MHz) and clock number 7 (\(\nu_{int}=\)320 MHz). The wrong bunch crossing probability is less than \(10^{-4}\).

Better results have been found for the small chamber sector, because the shorter strip length of the RPC used in this subsystem.

This demonstrates that the trigger detector, layout and electronics match the requirement on the bunch crossing identification (\(5\times 10^{-3}\)) [7].

### Impact on the fake muon trigger rate

According to the present understanding of the fake trigger rate dependence from the geometry of the system, the physics background rate and the timing of the trigger logic, the fake trigger rate increases linearly with \(\Delta t_{c}\) for the low-\(p_{T}\) trigger system, while it goes quadratically for the high-\(p_{T}\) system. The use of the interpolator running at 320 MHz would have a marginally lower fake trigger rate in the low-\(p_{T}\) system (about 70%), but it would be a factor of 2 lower for the whole system (corresponding to the high-\(p_{T}\) trigger). This result should be well considered before dropping the option of a fast interpolator.

Figure 18 shows the muon trigger rate of the barrel high-\(p_{T}\) system for \(\Delta t_{c}=25\) ns. The fake rate due to background is compared with the genuine muon rate. As it can be seen, the timing performance of the barrel trigger system allow a strong reduction of the fake trigger rate to acceptable levels, with either interpolator frequencies.

## 8 Conclusion

The present study showed that the proposed trigger system for the barrel sector, from the detector to the layout and the electronics, well matches the requirement of safe bunch crossing identification.

Furthermore, the effective time coincidence is short enough to allow strong reduction of the fake trigger rate induced by physics background. In particular, the option of a interpolator frequency \(\nu_{int}=3\,20\) MHz would lead to a considerably lower trigger rate with respect to a interpolator twice slower.
