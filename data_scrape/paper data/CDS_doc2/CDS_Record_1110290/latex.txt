## 1 Introduction

The purpose of this document is to help with producing papers and notes within ATLAS that are as well-written as possible. It contains a collection of rules, recommendations, information, and advice about many aspects of preparing good papers, so that readers can understand them easily and concentrate on the content. The aim of the Guide is to help--it is not just a collection of rigid rules. However, the information provided is based on experience, and ignoring some of the points can certainly lead to difficulty in getting the paper approved and published, as well as wasting time and effort in fixing unnecessary problems.

The officially approved rules and procedures for submitting a paper for approval by ATLAS and then getting it published are spelled out on the Publications Committee (PubChem) web pages [1]. The PubCom home page also includes links to further documentation with more detailed discussions concerning number rounding, figures and plots, referencing and acknowledgements. Information concerning author lists [2] is also available, and is not repeated here. Those lists are created by the Physics Office.

The tool adopted by ATLAS to typeset papers and notes is LaTeX. A set of templates and styles files is available in the atlaslatex package [3]. In particular, this package provides a template that defines the standard ATLAS preprint format to be used for all papers. In this Guide we assume that the package is used to typeset papers.

The Guide is organized as follows. Section 2 gives some general rules for document preparation, and Section 3 describes the contents of a typical paper. Section 4 discusses many points about layout, styles, typography, and units. Section 5 has information on the correct use of English, including a discussion of British and American spelling. This guide is not, however, a comprehensive grammar text, as many good ones are already available. Appendix A lists SI and other units, abbreviations and symbols relevant to ATLAS.

A comprehensive **ATLAS Glossary**, defining ATLAS terminology and abbreviations as well as giving standard ways of writing them, is available [4].

**Recommendation boxes:** Main recommendations made in this Guide are labelled and put in a box.

## 2 Basic rules

There are some basic rules _always_ to bear in mind when writing any scientific document.

* **Take account of the likely audience.**

Think about who is going to read the paper, and why. Do not give a lot of detail about aspects that are not the main subject of the paper unless they have an effect on the results. Define non-standard jargon and abbreviations unless they are very widely known and understood.

**Examples:** (a) Someone reading a physics paper would not normally need some of the finer details of the instrumentation, but an instrumentation paper on part of the detector does need details. (b) Anarticle in a popular scientific magazine should explain particle physics jargon in a way that is not necessary in a scientific journal.
* **Be consistent.** To make your writing clear, easier to understand, and less irritating for the reader, make a conscious choice about the terminology or convention to use, and do it _everywhere_.

**Example:** Do not mix 'endcap', 'end-cap', 'Endcap', 'End Cap', etc.--choose one standard version (according to ATLAS standard usage) and always use it.
* **Think about the logical flow of your presentation.** Take time to think about how best to order the presentation of the work. A detailed outline of the analysis techniques, the results, and the conclusions drawn can be very useful, and should be discussed with the EdBoard before producing the first draft. It is easier to move things around at this stage than after a draft has been written.

## 3 Elements of a typical ATLAS paper

This section lists the different elements of an ATLAS paper, together with brief guidelines on what they should contain. Although different types of papers, notes and reports may change the relative emphasis or require somewhat different organization, what is presented here could also serve as a checklist to ensure that nothing obvious is left out. Recommendations apply to the standard ATLAS preprint style, which is accepted by the journals. In a few instances, instructions specific to a journal are given.

Standard pieces of text to describe various aspects of the experimental setup or components of an analysis can be found on the PubCom pages [5].

### Front page matter

#### 3.1.1 Title

**Recommendation:** The title should be concise, clear and descriptive, and should include the word 'ATLAS'. Only the first word and all proper nouns should be capitalized, e.g. 'Search for large extra dimensions in ATLAS'.

Since the title is the first thing a potential reader will see, it should be attention-grabbing if possible--but without overstatement.

The title should not be exactly the same as that of a previous paper. Avoid using integrated luminosities in the title. This is tolerated if the integrated luminosity is required to differentiate a paper from previous ones, but be sure to round the value to the nearest fb\({}^{-1}\) (e.g. write 36 instead of 36.1). Inclusion of '\(pp\) collisions' or centre-of-mass energy is not required but may be helpful to the reader.

#### 3.1.2 Authors

The ATLAS 'Publications Policies' document [1] lists the rules and procedures for papers and other types of ATLAS notes and reports, and explains the rules defining authorship.

All ATLAS papers _must_ use the standard ATLAS author list, provided via the Authorship Committee web page [2].

All ATLAS CONF and PUB notes _must_ have as authors 'ATLAS Collaboration', without explicit names.

For publications from specific ATLAS projects with a restricted author list, the style of the author list should be as follows:

**Recommendation:** List all the names together followed by all the institutes together, using superscript numbers or letters after each name to indicate institute affiliations.

**Recommendation:** It is customary in particle physics to list authors alphabetically, so the name of the first author does not indicate a dominant contribution.

#### 3.1.3 Abstract

**Recommendation:** The abstract should be just one paragraph--clear, descriptive, and concise--and no more than a quarter to a third of a page long. It should stand on its own and, similarly, the main text of the publication should not depend on information given solely in the abstract.

For physics papers, the abstract should state:

* what was measured;
* where it was done (i.e. ATLAS at the LHC);
* with what data set-do specify \(pp\) (adapt as needed) collisions as well as the centre-of-mass energy- and integrated luminosity;
* what method was used; and
* what the primary results and main conclusions were.

Instrumentation and other papers can follow a different style, but should still have a clear and complete structure.

References, abbreviations, symbol definitions and jargon should all be avoided in an abstract. If only Monte Carlo data are used in the work described, this should be stated explicitly.

Remember that many potential readers (especially if doing searches on arXiv or other websites) will look at the title, and then read or quickly skim the abstract in order to decide whether to read the paper itself. If we want people to click on the link to the paper, it is worth putting in some effort to make the abstract as readable, motivating and inviting as possible--but of course without overstating the significance of the results. Refrain from writing 'First measurement' or 'First search'.

For papers submitted to EPJC, limit the abstract to 200 words as this is the maximum allowed number for the EPJC online version.

### Body

Here we list suggested sections for the main body of a physics publication. Depending on the nature of the paper, some of these might assume great importance while others may not be needed or could be very brief. Obviously, other types of papers and notes (e.g. instrumentation) will differ.

#### 3.2.1 Introduction

This should be fairly brief, so start with about one page as a target length. State the measurement being made, and its importance both experimentally and theoretically. Summarize what is known to date. If the results supersede previous ATLAS results then say so, but do not give the results explicitly. If the outline of the paper does not follow the obvious formula of theory, detector description, data samples used, data analysis, summary of the results, and conclusions, then it is often worth including a brief outline of the rest of the paper.

#### 3.2.2 Theory, models, and definition of important quantities

Give a brief explanation of the relevant theory and/or models. Some discussion of the need for measurements, and definitions of important quantities or relevant equations that will be used, should be given. Sometimes this material need not be in a separate section and can, for example, be covered in the introduction.

#### 3.2.3 Experimental setup

Give a condensed description of the ATLAS detector, focusing on the elements essential to the analysis. Describe when the data were taken, any special circumstances, and the integrated luminosity and running conditions of the data set.

#### 3.2.4 Monte Carlo model

Any Monte Carlo modelling should be described, and names of the programs used given. Any corrections or special parameter settings should be clearly explained.

#### 3.2.5 Event selection

This should describe and justify the selection criteria and analysis methods, such as trigger requirements, offline requirements and selections, etc. Report the number of events obtained. Discuss the backgrounds, any unusual features, etc.

#### 3.2.6 Statistical and systematic uncertainties

It is important to have a detailed list of the uncertainties, both statistical and systematic. The methods by which they were obtained, and a justification of the resulting values, is crucial to the significance of the results.

#### 3.2.7 Results

The experimental results should be stated, but usually without interpretation at this point.

#### 3.2.8 Discussion

Make comparisons with fits and other measurements, and discuss how well they agree. Put the results into the context of theories or models, and interpret what can be learned.

#### 3.2.9 Summary and conclusions

Reiterate the main points of the paper, the primary results, and what they might mean. Make sure to include the type of collision, integrated luminosity and centre-of-mass energy. Be sure to mention ATLAS and LHC. Summarize the importance of the paper, reflecting the abstract, but do not overstate it.

Do not refer to figures, tables or references.

Readers who have been attracted by the title and abstract very often jump straight to the conclusion, so it should be interesting enough to make them want to read the whole paper!

#### 3.2.10 Appendix

Papers may include one or more appendices that should immediately follow the conclusion section. Appendices are part of the published paper and should not be confused with the auxiliary material section included in many paper drafts during ATLAS circulation. Appendices should contain material that is important enough to be part of the paper but may be of a more technical nature or archival nature than the material in the main part of the paper. Authors may also want to include material that would otherwise disrupt the general flow of the paper.

A narrative is needed to present and possibly discuss figures and tables that are included in appendices.

### Figures

It is very important to note that all figures must be approved explicitly by the Collaboration, and cannot then be edited without being re-approved. Documents with more details concerning ATLAS recommendations and advice for figures can be found on the PubCom home page [1].

#### 3.3.1 File formats

**Recommendation:** Individual source files for the figures, in their original formats and resolutions, should always be kept available in case they have to be edited, and for general use in talks and other documents.

The preferred format for figures is portable document format (PDF). For photographs JPEG is a common choice and for vector drawings the choice should be PDF.

**Recommendation:** In general, simple line diagrams work better in a paper than elaborately shaded ones with pseudo 3-dimensional effects that might look good in an oral (e.g. PowerPoint) presentation.

**Recommendation:** Convert the final document to PDF, which can handle both vector and bitmap images and is readable using free software on all major operating systems.

#### 3.3.2 General RULES and RECOMMENDATIONS for figures

* All figures appearing in a paper must be mentioned in the text. The figures should appear in the same order as referred to in the text, and should be placed reasonably close to where they are first mentioned. Guidelines for producing figures can be found on the PubCom home page [1]. In particular, ROOT macros are made available to achieve the recommended style for figures, see Ref. [6].
* Always use the full word 'Figure', not 'Fig.', and capitalize it. For example, 'This distribution is shown in Figure 7 in Section 4.3'. Use a non-breaking space (see Section 4.2.4) between 'Figure' and the number so they stay together on the same line.
* If a figure has two or more parts, refer to it as 'Figure 1(a)' and 'Figure 1(b)', etc. Both '(a)' and '(b)' should appear in the text and in the caption if those parts of the figure are referred to in the body of the paper.
* Figures should have a uniform style and size throughout the paper.
* Try to make the figures work in both colour and monochrome. Since figures are approved only once, it is very helpful if they are suitable both for conference presentations (colour) and journal publication (monochrome). In addition, even when documents are designed mainly for on-screen viewing, some readers will print them or make photocopies (usually monochrome!), either because they find it easier to read from paper, or they want to read them in situations where a screen is not available.
* The caption and text should not mention colours, nor require any colour distinctions in order to interpret the figure (e.g. 'the red curve corresponds to...').
* Note that figures may be reduced in size for publication, and that readers do not all have superb eyesight or excellent printers. As a guide, numbers and capital letters should be at least 2 mm high. Very thin lines may become difficult to see. A good test is to reduce figures by 50% and then check to make sure that all lines, letters, and numbers (especially subscripts and superscripts!) are still clearly visible.

* Check carefully that any labels used in figures are consistent with both the caption and the text in terms of spelling, nomenclature, etc.
* Although there are no strict rules for resolution of figures, approximate targets are 250-300 lines per inch (~100 lines per cm) for photographs and 600 lines per inch (~250 lines per cm) for line drawings.
* A good place for figures is at the tops of pages, except when a main heading would normally be there. (In LaTeX ensure this with 
\begin{tabular}{} \end{tabular} This also avoids having isolated text trapped above a big figure at the top of a page.
* To make sure that figures do not appear in or after the Conclusions section, add the \FloatBarrier directive before the start of the Conclusions section.

#### 3.3.3 General RULES and RECOMMENDATIONS for graphs and plots

* If a figure presents data or results, the word 'ATLAS' (or 'ATLAS Preliminary' if appropriate) must appear prominently somewhere in the figure. This becomes important when the figure is copied and/or shown out of context. If only simulation is used, the label should be 'ATLAS Simulation' (or 'ATLAS Simulation Preliminary').
* All axes must be labelled, including units. Units should be given in square brackets, e.g. 'Energy [GeV]'. Axis titles should be big, clear, and meaningful as well as begin with a capital letter. Axis numbers should be in a clear, standard font. On histograms, the vertical axis title should specify the bin width, e.g. 'Events / 10 GeV' for a histogram with fixed 10 GeV bin width (this is to be read as 'events per 10 GeV'). If the bin width is variable, different solutions exist. If the bin width varies smoothly the only usable vertical axis title is of the form 'Events' or 'Events / GeV' depending on context. If the bin width is, say, 10 GeV or multiples of 10 GeV, a good choice is 'Events / 10 GeV' where the bin content is divided by 2 if the width is 20 GeV. 'Events / 1' is not needed and writing just 'Events' is acceptable. For some figures, the title should instead be 'Jets / 10 GeV', 'Electrons / 10 GeV', as is appropriate.
* If a distribution is normalized to unity, the vertical axis title should be 'Fraction of events / 10 GeV' (adapt to the appropriate value for the bin width).
* If different plotting symbols are used, a legend box explaining them must appear somewhere in the figure. The symbols should be listed in the order that they appear in the figure.
* If stacking histograms, the stacking order should be the same as the order in the legend.
* The automatic statistics and fit results box from ROOT should be omitted.
* Pick solid, prominent plotting symbols to represent ATLAS data when comparing to other data, and use bold lines when superimposing curves.

* It is useful to have tick marks appearing on all four sides of a figure, especially for scatter plots. Include these wherever possible. One may need to overplot the tick marks as the last drawing step to make them visible.
* Theoretical models should usually be referred to by their name or an appropriate acronym in the figure legend, i.e. a paper reference is discouraged and certainly no reference number should be included in the legend.
* If a figure is made with a prescaled trigger, the true integrated luminosity seen by that trigger should be specified in the plot. If a set of triggers with various prescale factors is used, a range of integrated luminosity values should be provided. The main text should specify that prescaled triggers are used and perhaps provide the prescale values as well. The figure caption may also specify that the distribution is obtained with a (set of) prescaled trigger(s).

#### 3.3.4 General RULES and RECOMMENDATIONS for figure captions

* The caption should only describe the content of the figure and not provide an interpretation or discussion of its content. Those belong in the main text.
* Subcaptions are not recommended, other than to distinguish (a), (b), etc. In particular, do not place lots of text in subcaptions as the information belongs in the figure caption.
* Labels to differentiate between plots (e.g. \(p_{\rm T}\) ranges per plot) should be included in the plot itself, since plots are likely to be shown in talks without the subcaptions.
* For multi-part figures, the convention 'this figure shows (a) first thing, (b) second thing,...' should be followed over 'this figure shows first thing (a), second thing (b),...'.
* All variables and plotting symbols used in the figure must be defined in the caption. Define all lines used in the figure (solid, dashed, dot-dashed, dotted, etc.)
* If relevant, the normalization method of the plot should be specified.

### Tables

#### 3.4.1 General RULES and RECOMMENDATIONS for tables

* All tables appearing in a paper must be mentioned in the text. The tables should appear in the same order as referred to in the text, and should be placed reasonably close to where they are first mentioned.
* There is no abbreviation for the word 'Table'.
* Capitalize the first word of any row or column heading.
* All rows/columns must be labelled, including units if appropriate. Units are given in brackets, e.g. 'Energy [GeV]'.

* Horizontal and vertical lines should be used as necessary to make the table entries clear. If there are several tables use a consistent style.
* If table entries are text they should usually be left-aligned.
* If numerical table entries include uncertainties, the entries should be aligned on the \(\pm\) sign. If they include decimal points, the entries should be aligned on the decimal points. Otherwise, numerical column entries should usually be right-aligned.
* A good place for tables is at the tops of pages, except when a main heading would normally be there. (In LaTeX ensure this with 
\begin{table}[t].) This also avoids having isolated text trapped above a big table at the top of a page.

#### 3.4.2 General RULES and RECOMMENDATIONS for table captions

* Many journals require that the table caption should appear above the table, so this is the recommended option. At the end of the caption a full stop (period) is usually used.
* All variables or symbols used in the table must be defined in the caption.

### Acknowledgements

A standard acknowledgement paragraph is provided by the Publications Committee [7]. The contributions of the laboratory, the machine group, and the funding agencies are covered in that paragraph. Any additional acknowledgements beyond the standard paragraph can only be made with the approval of the Publications Committee chairperson. The names of ATLAS authors should not appear in the acknowledgements of an ATLAS physics publication. For physics papers, the contribution of a non-collaboration member (typically a theorist) can be added to the reference to a paper by that individual with a note as in 'we thank Jane Doe for updated calculations'. For detector papers, the rules are more flexible as the entire ATLAS author list may not always be used. However, the naming of specific individuals should only appear at the end of the acknowledgements.

### References and footnotes

Although the style of referencing is journal dependent, papers are to be prepared with the **standard ATLAS preprint format**[3] and should follow the recommendations below.

References should be handled with BibTeX[8] as this is integrated into the ATLAS preprint template [3]. The bibliography files provided in the atlaslatex package should be used as much as possible to guarantee proper formatting of the references. Specific bib files exist for ATLAS and CMS papers, as well as for ATLAS PUB and CONF notes. To cite one of those sources, simply use the reference code for the relevant paper or note. For example, use \cite{EXOT-2015-11} for papers, \cite{ATLAS-CONF-2016-039} for CONF notes, and \cite{ATL-PHYS-PUB-2014-021} for PUB notes.

**Recommendation:** Use BibTeX for references and the bib files in the atlaslatex package.

#### 3.6.1 General RULES and RECOMMENDATIONS for references

This section is based on ATLAS and journal rules, and experience with journal referees.

* Cite only permanent, publicly available, or ATLAS-approved references, such as journals, books, TDRs, preprints or CONF/PUB notes, although the latter are only acceptable for performance studies when no corresponding paper is available.
* Do not refer to ATLAS COM, INT or other internal notes since they are not available outside ATLAS.
* If at all possible, quote only proper publications rather than ATLAS notes. If you have to quote notes, give a web address to 'permanent' storage such as arXiv or CDS.
* Only cite theses if the material is not available elsewhere, but beware of making unapproved material public. Give a web address if the item has not been published.
* Do not cite private references, such as private communications.
* Wherever possible, cite an article's journal reference rather than its preprint number. The arXiv number should be given as well, in the format arXiv:1234.56789 [hep-ph], or arXiv:hep-ph/1234567 for older references (without the extra [hep-ph] in that case). For example, [1] Phys. Lett. B **12** (2013) 123, arXiv:1234.56789 [hep-ph]. Do not include version numbers.
* Do not add'submitted to journal XYZ' to references, the arXiv number is sufficient. When the arXiv number is not available, use the CERN-EP preprint number as this is available when a draft paper enters second ATLAS circulation.
* Wherever possible, web addresses alone should be avoided, or used in addition to other information as they are not permanent. Do include DOIs (digital object identifiers) [9] in the bibtex entries, they will be translated into web links in the bibliography.
* When including web addresses, write https: instead of http: as the former is the recommended protocol for web access.
* ATLAS papers and CONF/PUB notes should have 'ATLAS Collaboration' as author and should not include a first author 'et al.'. The same rule applies to all other large experimental collaborations like CMS, CDF, D0, ALEPH, DELPHI, L3, OPAL, BaBar, Belle, etc.
* Include references to the following papers: ATLAS detector [10] (use \cite{PERF-2007-01}), Geant4 [11], ATLAS simulation [12] (use \cite{SOFT-2010-01}), and FastJet package [13], unless not relevant to the paper.
* Avoid referencing the Review of Particle Properties from the Particle Data Group for prior measurements, reference the original papers wherever possible, unless the numbers are only peripheral to the analysis.
* Always double-check references when copying them from another source.

### Some advice for editing and correcting papers

It is very difficult to judge your own writing objectively, especially at the time you are doing it. There are a number of things that you can do to produce a better paper. _Do not rely on the ATLAS editorial process to turn a sloppy draft into a well-written report or paper--it is far more efficient to write it as well as possible initially._

* Try to write short, simple phrases and sentences rather than long, complex ones. There is a strong tendency nowadays to use complicated'management-speak' much too often. A useful list of examples of unnecessary verbiage can be found on the CERN web pages on style [14].
* Re-read what you have written, but wait until some time has passed--certainly not the same day.
* Get colleagues to read the paper. If it is long, ask people to concentrate on specific parts according to their expertise rather than just asking them to read the whole thing. (But do not lose sight of the full picture.)
* Remember that the reader is not an expert in your analysis. In order to ensure that it is comprehensible to non-experts, it is very useful to get someone _not_ familiar with the topic to read the paper.
* If you are not writing in your native language, ask someone whose native language it is to read the paper. Try to find a person who is careful about writing--many people are not, even in their own language.

Some points that are more ATLAS-specific:

* Write a detailed outline of the paper and discuss it with the EdBoard. It is much easier to rearrange the order of presentation at this point than later on. Particular attention should be paid to the description of the event selection and the determination of the background; sometimes a given process is background in one part of the paper and signal in another part.
* Be careful not to copy and paste too much from CONF notes. This often leads to disjointed text if several notes are used as input to a single paper.
* ATLAS internal notes are not available to the reader, so include all the relevant arguments in the paper.

### Other RECOMMENDATIONS related to content

* The statistical uncertainty related to the size of the Monte Carlo simulation samples should be included as a source of systematic uncertainty.
* The result of a fit may yield a central value or part of the one-standard-deviation allowed region outside of the physical range of a parameter of interest. In that case, the central value should be quoted with its uncertainty regardless of whether or not it is in the physical range of that parameter. The confidence interval this corresponds to taking the physical range into account should also be quoted.

## 4 Layout, styles, and typography

This section begins with the overall layout of a paper and the organization of sections and subsections. This is followed by an introduction to the concept of styles. Then some of the basics of typography are described, including a section on typing special characters. We also discuss the use of units, equations, lists, as well as symbols and italics.

### Document layout

#### 4.1.1 Overall layout

If done well, the layout of a paper and its general attractiveness can make reading it as easy and pleasant as possible. This is generally achieved with the ATLAS preprint style implemented in the atlaslate package. Figures and tables are very important; there is some general advice on laying out figures and tables in Section 3.3 and Section 3.4, respectively.

**Recommendation:** Use of **ATLAS standard preprint formatting**[3] implemented in the atlaslate package will guarantee proper layout for the paper.

#### 4.1.2 Organization into sections and subsections

Good organization of a paper can make it easier to read and understand. Before starting to write the main text, think about the outline of the paper in terms of the sections needed and how they fit together into a consistent hierarchy. This can always be changed later as the paper develops, but it is helpful to see at the beginning what material is needed.

Do not go too far with the division into sections--two or three levels of sections and subsections should usually be enough. If you get to four you should question whether that is really necessary (unless the document is very long and complex). Try to be consistent in the sort of detail needed for each level. If there are very big differences in the lengths of sections at the same level, make sure there is a good reason and that it is not due to inconsistent organization. If most of the sections are very short, especially at the finest level of detail, consider whether some of the information could be combined. On the other hand, if sections are very long you should be asking whether they would be better broken up into shorter sections. Note that a paper to be submitted to PRL should not have sections.

When referring to a section in the text, write out the word in full and capitalized, e.g. 'This is discussed in Section 4.3'. Do not use 'Sect.'.

### Typography

Text is divided into paragraphs. There are two ways to indicate where they start and end: by having white space between them, or by indenting the first line of each paragraph. LaTeX handles this automatically, without the need for extra blank paragraphs.

Similarly, the choice of font and its size is handled by LaTeX, and implemented uniformly with the style files in atlaslatex.

Many of the points below, especially particle symbols and related items, are implemented in the file atlasphysics.sty [3]. Documentation about symbols is available at Ref. [16].

**Recommendation:** Use the macros defined in atlasphysics.sty for particle symbols, variables, etc. This will ensure correctness and consistency, as well as saving you some work.

#### 4.2.1 Numbers

A common confusion is whether to write out numbers in words or to use digits. The general rule is that small numbers should be written out (e.g. 'three quarks') while larger ones are not (e.g. '64 sectors in azimuth'). A common choice for making the distinction is to write out numbers of ten or less. If you have a mixture do not mix digits and words in the same sentence--the normal choice is to use digits for all the numbers.

Numbers together with units (e.g. '3 mm'), decimal points (e.g. 'the ratio is 3.5'), or percentages _always_ use digits.

If the value before a decimal point is zero then write it (e.g. '0.5' not '.5'), since otherwise the decimal point is easy to miss. For larger numbers, write e.g. '4 000', '40 000', etc. with a small space as a divider (use \(\backslash\), in LaTeX). Using spaces rather than commas avoids ambiguities due to some countries using commas instead of decimal points.

As always, whatever choices you make should be applied consistently.

**Recommendation:** Write out integers from one to ten. Use digits for decimals, percentages, and when there are units. Use spaces for numbers with four or more digits. Numbers at the beginning of a sentence should always be written out. Do not mix digits and words in the same sentence--use digits.

Recommendations for the presentation of numbers are as follows:

* A document on ATLAS recommendations and advice for rounding of numbers is available [17]. Usually, one adopts either using two significant figures or the PDG rounding rules, see Section 5.3 of Ref. [18]. Errors should never have more than three significant figures and normally should have only one or two.
* Central values should always be quoted with the same number of decimal places.

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:21]

Specific recommendations about symbols are as follows:

* Numbers such as e and i are usually not in italics, because they are not variables.
* The symbol for the anti-kt jet clustering algorithm is anti-\(k_{t}\), typeset with the $\antikt$ macro in atlashpics.sty.
* The missing transverse momentum is denoted \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\) with the atlashpics.sty macro \(\mathtt{Umet}\). The word'momentum' is used even though it is mainly calculated from the calorimeter energy deposits. If the missing transverse momentum is evaluated with charged-particle tracks only, use $p_ttext{{T}}^\wedge\text{{text{text{text{$\Sigma$}}}}}\).
* If a symbol is defined by a macro and is to be followed by a space, use a trailing '\(\backslash\)'(e.g. \(\backslash\)pt\(\backslash\) ) to ensure this. Note that the '\(\backslash\)' is not needed if there is something other than a space, such as a punctuation, after the symbol.
* Use \(\Delta R\) rather than \(R\) for \(\sqrt{(\Delta\eta)^{2}+(\Delta\phi)^{2}}\) cone sizes but use \(R\) for the anti-\(k_{t}\) radius parameter.
* Use Greek letters for particle symbols--do not spell out Greek letter names, e.g. \(\pi\) or \(\mu\) not 'pi' or'mu'. However, 'pion' or'muon' are acceptable.
* The complications of notating different \(\tau\)-lepton decay modes are spelled out in a separate note [19]. Note that the recommended use for the third-generation charged lepton is '\(\tau\)-lepton', rather than 'tau', 'tau lepton' or just '\(\tau\)'.
* The \(Z\) boson should be written without the zero (i.e. \(Z\) rather than \(Z^{0}\)).
* Always use a cursive \(\ell\) (\(\backslash\)ell in LaTeX) for a generic lepton (usually \(e\) or \(\mu\)).
* Use \(m\) rather than \(M\) for masses, e.g. \(m_{W}\), \(m_{H}\), \(m_{t}\).

#### 4.2.3 Subscripts and superscripts

Subscripts and superscripts should be in italics if they are variables or characters that take values, and in normal text if they simply represent words or labels. For example, e\({}^{x}\) has an italic exponent but \(E_{\mathrm{jet}}\) does not have an italic subscript.

**Recommendation:** If subscripts and superscripts are not variables then do not use italics. Specific examples are \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\), \(E_{\mathrm{T}}\) and \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\). Many such symbols have macros defined in atlashpics.sty, see Ref. [16].

#### 4.2.4 Special characters

In this section we mention some special characters: why they are used, and how to produce them in LaTeX.

##### En-dashes and em-dashes

The usage of hyphens, and the longer versions known as en-dashes (the width of an 'N') and em-dashes (the width of an 'M') is discussed in Section 5.4.1, Section 5.4.2, and Section 5.4.3, respectively. Note that en-dashes, _not_ hyphens, should be used for minus signs. To produce en-dashes and em-dashes in LaTeX just type two consecutive hyphens (- - ) for an en-dash and three hyphens (- - -) for an em-dash.

##### Line-breaks

Sometimes you would like to force text on to a new line, but without starting a new paragraph. In LaTeX use the command \linebreak.

##### Non-breaking spaces

It is often desirable to use a non-breaking space to force text including a space to stay together on the same line. A very common example is a number and its associated units; others include 'Figure', 'Table', or 'Section' with their associated number, and also first initials and surnames. For a non-breaking space in LaTeX just type the character '-'.

##### Non-breaking hyphens

Hyphens do not normally force the following text to stay on the same line. Sometimes it is better if it does, so a non-breaking hyphen is used. In LaTeX the command is '\mbox{-}'.

##### Quotation marks

Quotation marks in formatted text should be the proper 'curly' kind, which look like this: '...' or "...". Apostrophes should also be 'curly', e.g. 'don't'. In LaTeX you use the convention '...' or''...''for single or double quotation marks, respectively; apostrophes are handled automatically. For usage of these characters, see Section 5.5.4. But _note_ that the symbols for prime (', in LaTeX $'$ or $\prime$) and double prime ( ", in LaTeX $"$), which are also used for minutes and seconds (and also feet and inches, if you need to use them), must _not_ be 'curly'.

##### Thick and thin spaces

Spaces of more or less than standard width are especially useful for making mathematical expressions easier to read and understand. LaTeX provides thin (,,), medium (!), and thick (!) spaces in math mode.

#### 4.2.5 Units

All units should be SI unless there is a very good reason not to do so. There is a list of units and their internationally agreed symbols, with non-SI units flagged, in Appendix A. The multiplicative prefixes such as nano or Mega are also listed; in general only steps of \(10^{3}\) should be used. It is good practice to use prefixes or scientific notation so that the numbers are not very big or small.

Prefixes for multipliers smaller than one are lower-case, while multipliers larger than one are capitalized--with the important exception of 'k' in order to avoid confusion between kilo and kelvin.

In a scientific paper avoid using SI-deprecated units or prefixes that are common in everyday life, such as centimetres or decilitres.

The names of units, even when they are the name of a person, are _not_ capitalized, with the exception of degrees Celsius. However, unit symbols are often capitalized. ('T' is for 'tesla', but 'Tesla' is the man not the unit.)

Units should always be in roman type, _not_ italic. This is a common error when LaTeX math mode is used. Two ways for doing it correctly are: $x=25-$mm, or $10*{34}\(\sim\)mathrm{{cm^{A}{-2}s^{A}{-1}}$.

For percentages, do not include a space between the number and the percent sign.

For energy units, use the \MeV, \GeV, and \TeV macros. They include a typographical spacing correction for the unusual 'eV' character combination.

**Recommendation:** Use SI units and their preferred (powers of \(10^{3}\)) prefixes.

**Recommendation:** There should be a non-breaking space between the value and the symbol for the unit, to ensure that they stay together on the same line. (For how to do this see Section 4.2.4.)

**Recommendation:** The choice in ATLAS is to use natural units, where \(c=h/2\pi=1\). This means mass is in \(\GeV\) rather than \(\GeV/c^{2}\), and momentum is in \(\GeV\) rather than \(\GeV/c\). Note that if you do use \(\GeV/c^{2}\) or similar, the \(c\) should be in italics (Section 4.2.2).

#### 4.2.6 Equations

Equations should only be inserted in-line if they are very short and simple. To preserve the line spacing, any fractions should be horizontal, using /, rather than vertical. All other equations should be on a separate line and centred.

If there are several lines of equations, the method of aligning them depends to some extent on the context. Sometimes it is clearer if the equal signs are vertically aligned (e.g. in a derivation); if not then the equations might be better left-aligned.

Only number an equation if it is actually referred to in the text. The number should be in parentheses at the right-hand margin. The reference to it should be of the form 'Eq. (3)' unless it is at the beginning of sentence in which case it should be 'Equation (3)'. To avoid numbering an equation in LaTeX, use \begin{equation*}... \end{equation*}.

In-line equations and equations that stand on their own should be punctuated just like any other part of a sentence, i.e. full stops (periods), semicolons, commas, etc.

**Recommendation:** Use punctuation for all equations.

In LaTeX, always use math mode for writing equations. Standard functions such as sine should use macros (e.g. \(\backslash\)sin) so that they are correctly set in roman (not italic) text.

#### 4.2.7 Lists

There are two general types of displayed lists: enumerated, in which items are designated by numbers or letters and ordered in a specific way; and bullet-style lists, where items are set off by a standard symbol (or sometimes no symbol at all). It is usual to distinguish lists from the main text by the use of different margins, text size, font, or line spacing, LaTeX handles this.

If each item contains enough text to make full sentences, then treat each one as a paragraph in its own right and end it with a full stop (period). This is how most of the lists in this document have been written; see for example Section 4.2.2.

If the items are short, such that taken together they should form a sentence with commas or semicolons as separators, then end each item in that way and put a full stop (period) at the end of the last item. A list example is shown below.

Detector calibration will be effective only if it is:

* closely monitored,
* comprehensive, and
* done regularly.

Whether to start each item with a capital letter may depend partly on the length of the items, and is a matter of taste.

**Recommendation:** Capitalize and punctuate lists as if they were normal sentences.

#### 4.2.8 Use of italics and bold type

* Italics and bold type can be used for emphasis, but this must be done sparingly. For example, 'I don't care _how_ you do it; just _do_ it.' The use of underlined text or capital letters for emphasis is discouraged, and may also cause confusion with web links.
* Italics can be used instead of quotation marks for the titles of books, magazines and journals, articles and papers. For example, 'The paper was published in _Physical Review Letters_ recently'.

* When new words or phrases are introduced they are sometimes set off by using italics or quotation marks. The use of italics is preferred. For example, 'This procedure is called a _pedestal run._' Do not use a different font family to do this. A useful suggestion is to use italics at the place where a new word that would otherwise be in normal type is defined, and to use quotation marks when the word must always be set off to avoid confusion with normal use of the word, for example'medium' electrons.
* Italics (or math mode in LaTeX) are used for variables, and often for constants of nature and particle symbols (see Section 4.2.2, and the note on superscripts and subscripts in Section 4.2.3).

#### Words from other languages

Italics are used to set off words or phrases from another language, e.g. 'We used the following _ansatz_...'. However, 'foreign' terms that become standard usage lose their italic status. This is a very grey area, since people disagree about which terms have become standard English. Candidates include 'ad hoc', 'ad nauseam', 'au fait', 'bremsstrahlung', 'en route', 'et al.', 'in situ','versus', and 'vice versa'.

Another problem is whether to retain accents and other diacritical marks when words have become 'naturalized' into English. Words like 'cafe' and 'role' are now usually written without diacritical marks, but it is much less clear what to do about less frequently used words such as 'pate', etc.

**Recommendation:** Words and abbreviations which are commonly used in everyday English should not be in italics, and need not retain accents and other diacritical marks.

## 5 English usage

This section discusses some of the issues that arise when writing papers in English. It is not intended to be a complete guide to all the subtleties of English grammar and usage. Some books about writing English that are used and recommended by professionals are given in Refs. [20, 21, 22]. Many journals provide their own style guides; Reviews of Modern Physics has an interesting one that concentrates on good writing and has a useful section for non-native English speakers [23].

Possibly the most obvious issue, especially at an international laboratory like CERN, is American versus British English. (Not to mention variants used in other English-speaking countries.) Although the use of grammar is similar, there are obvious differences in spelling. There are more of these than many people notice, and to make things really confusing there are cases (especially in British English) where more than one spelling of a word is acceptable. A choice is necessary, and whichever you choose it must be done consistently.

**Recommendation:** British English should be used for European journals and American English should be used for American journals (PRC, PRD, and PRL). Note that this does not resolve all spelling issues--see Section 5.2.3.

Some areas cause problems even for native English speakers. Capitalization can start a lot of arguments, often due to a fuzzy distinction between proper names and ordinary ones. Hyphenation has few strict rules, and as new words are invented and become common usage they often lose their hyphens. For example, do you write 'End Cap', 'End-Cap', 'Endcap', 'end cap', 'end-cap', or 'endcap'? The **ATLAS Glossary**[4] provides recommendations on this and many others.

### General considerations

#### 5.1.1 Tense

It is difficult to use a fixed tense when writing a paper. The use of tense must be consistent within a sentence. The present tense should usually be used for statements whose validity remains as true when they are written as when they are read, e.g. 'The data agree with the theoretical predictions'. The past tense should be used for statements whose validity is dated, e.g. 'The data were recorded in 2015'.

In the introduction of a paper, where the current physics landscape is surveyed, the present tense should be used. For the rest of the paper, the tense used should distinguish between what is properly in the past and what is still true. Specifically, the data-taking and the Monte Carlo production are in the past, while the analysis, results, and conclusions are in the present. This also tends to engage the reader more.

Do not use tenses such as the past perfect (e.g. 'had been') or present perfect (e.g. 'has been' or 'have been') when the simple past or present (e.g. 'was' or 'is') are appropriate. For example, 'This efficiency was found to be 0.85' rather than 'This efficiency has been found to be 0.85'. This is more direct and immediate.

Do not write phrases like 'this will be discussed in Section 5.2'--it is discussed there now, so just say 'this is discussed in Section 5.2'.

Avoid giving orders as in 'Note that'. The meaning is usually precisely the same without this instruction.

#### 5.1.2 Voices: passive, active and personal

Scientific literature has traditionally used the passive voice (e.g. 'A review of this problem was given by Bloggs') because it can sound more objective. On the other hand, the active voice (e.g. 'Bloggs reviewed this problem') is often more natural, shorter and more direct--it can be used where there is a significant gain in clarity.

However, active writing often uses personal pronouns, e.g. 'we'. Such use is not recommended for ATLAS papers.

**Recommendation:** Avoid the use of personal pronouns.

#### 5.1.3 Sentence structure

Avoid long, complicated sentences. If a sentence becomes really long you will often find that it can be broken up into two or more sentences without losing any meaning. Long introductory elements in a sentence are not good style. Sentences are often more effective if the point you are trying to emphasize is given at the end of the sentence.

#### 5.1.4 Jargon

Avoid using ATLAS-specific and LHC-specific jargon, i.e. expressions used mainly within the Collaboration or at CERN, and be sure to define all of the terms you do use.

Examples of jargon that should be avoided are: 'Higgs-like', 'SM-like', or'monojet-like'.

#### 5.1.5 Acronyms

A **glossary** of ATLAS acronyms and other terminology is provided separately in Ref. [4]. Although useful for brevity, do not use too many acronyms. Check whether you are really saving much space, and not just using them once or twice. Readers will have trouble remembering them all, especially since many are similar. Always define acronyms where they are first used.

When using initials as an abbreviation, do not use spaces or dots, e.g. UN, BBC, LHC. (American usage tends to put dots after each letter, e.g. 'U.S.A.') Some people recommend using all capital letters when the acronym is pronounced as letters (e.g. EU), and small letters when it is said like a word (e.g. Nasa). But some acronyms are pronounced both ways, so this seems artificial and likely to confuse.

**Recommendation:** Use all capital letters for acronyms (as we do with 'ATLAS').

The pronunciation of acronyms also affects whether to use 'a' or 'an' in front of them. Use 'a' if it is pronounced as if it starts with a consonant sound (e.g. 'a ROD') and 'an' if it sounds as if it starts with a vowel sound (e.g. 'an AOD' or 'an SFI'); remember that some acronyms are pronounced as letters and others like a word. (Also see Section 5.6.5.)

#### 5.1.6 Slang, trendy expressions and obscure words

Remember that a large fraction of readers will not be native English speakers, and even those who are may not be familiar with slang from elsewhere. Trendy expressions often go out of date very quickly. Avoid obscure words and slang if at all possible. In general, try to keep things simple and clear.

### Spelling

This section is mainly concerned with British and American spelling. For unambiguous cases it is best to consult a good dictionary, though a spell-checker (set to the correct form of English!) often does a fairly good job. British spelling is recommended for European journals and American spelling is mandatory for American ones.

**Recommendation:** Use British spelling for European journals and American English for American journals (PRC, PRD, and PRL). Note that this does not resolve all spelling issues--see especially Section 5.2.3.

There is a good and useful article on British and American spelling differences in Wikipedia [24].

The following discussion is broken down into three sections: differences that are _always_ observed (Section 5.2.1), cases of British usage which seem to break the rules and are therefore tricky (Section 5.2.2), and some examples where British spelling offers a choice (sometimes leading to heated arguments) (Section 5.2.3).

In the following examples, the convention (British spelling)/(American spelling) is used in order to save space.

#### 5.2.1 Universal RULES

* **-our/-or:** behaviour/behavior, colour/color, favour/favor, flavour/flavor, honour/honor, humour/humor, labour/labor, neighbour/neighbor, tumour/tumor, rigour/rigor, vigour/vigor.
* **-ence/-ense:** defence/defense, offence/offense, pretence/pretense.
* **-re/-er:** centre/center, fibre/fiber, litre/liter, meagre/meager, theatre/theater.
* **-ogue/-og:** analogue/analog, catalogue/catalog (but note that 'analog' is often used at CERN).
* **-ise/-ize:** Although there are many words with endings _-ize_ in American spelling that can be either _ise_ or _ize_ in British spelling (see Section 5.2.3), there are also some words that _always_ have _ise_ endings in both. Some examples are: advertise, advise, arise, comprise, compromise, despise, devise, disguise, enterprise, exercise, expertise, improvise, premise, revise, supervise, surprise, and televise.
* **-yse/-yze:** analyse/analyze, catalyse/catalyze, paralyse/paralyze.
* **-oul-/-ol-:** mould/mold, smoulder/smolder.
* **-c-/-k:** mollusc/mollusk, sceptic/skeptic, sceptical/skeptical.
* **-s-/-ss-:** focusing/focussing, focused/focussed.
* **-l/-ll:** distil/distill, fulfil/fulfill, skilful/skillful, appeal/appall, _but_...
* **-ll-/-l-:** cancelling/canceling, levelling/leveling, modelling/modeling, travelling/traveling, tunnelling/tunneling.
* **-ge/-g:** acknowledgement/acknowledgment.

* **-ae-/-e- and -oe-/-e-:** amoeba/ameba, anaemic/anemic, anaesthetic/anesthetic, archaeology/archeology, haemoglobin/hemoglobin.
* **-eable/-able:** likeable/likable, liveable/livable, saleable/salable, scaleable/scalable; sizeable/sizable, unshakeable/unshakable, upgradeable/upgradable.
* **Chemical elements:** aluminium/aluminum, caesium/cesium, sulphur/sulfur.
* **Miscellaneous:** acroplane/airplane, ageing/aging, plough/plow, tyre/tire.

#### 5.2.2 RULES that can be unsuspected traps in British spelling

The following have special rules in _British_ (but _not_ in American) spelling:

* practise/practice when used as a verb, but 'practice' when used as a noun, e.g. 'to practise writing C++' _vs._ 'it is a common practice in C++'.
* licence/license when used as a noun, but 'license' when used as a verb e.g. 'I must license the software' _vs._ 'I have a licence for the software'.
* metre/meter for the unit, but'meter' for a measuring instrument.
* programme/program for the plan of an event, but 'program' for computer code.
* disc/disk, but 'disk' on a computer. But note that CD is _always_ Compact Disc, the registered trademark.
* instalment/installment, but 'install'.
* judgement/judgment, but 'judgment' in legal usage.
* speciality/specialty, but'specialty' for a branch of medicine.
* dependant/dependent when used as a noun, but 'dependent' when used as an adjective.
* grey/gray, but 'gray' for the radiation unit (named after L.H. Gray).
* rigour/rigor, but 'rigorous'.
* vigour/vigor, but 'vigorous'.
* vapour/vapor, but 'vaporize' (or vaporise).
* The past tense and past participle forms 'burned', 'learned' and'spelled' are correct in both British and American, but in British you can also use 'burnt', 'learnt' and'spelt'. However, 'earn' always becomes 'earned', and 'deal' always becomes 'dealt'.

#### 5.2.3 RULES with some choice allowed

A very common confusion in British spelling concerns the many words ending in _ise_ or _ize_, e.g. 'digitise' or 'digitize'. Other examples include 'emphasise' or 'emphasize', 'organise' or 'organize', 'polarise' or 'polarize','realise' or'realize', and'recognise' or'recognize'. The choice extends to other forms, e.g. 'digitising' or 'digitizing' and 'digitisation' or 'digitization'. American spelling _always_ uses 'z'. In everyday British writing the's' versions dominate. However, some British academic publishers (for example the Institute of Physics and Oxford University Press) recommend the 'z' forms, but do not insist on them. (This is based on historical arguments, not American usage.) The 'z' versions are often used at CERN, and seem to be a good, safe compromise. There are many affected words, so whichever choice you make you must put in some effort to be consistent. Note also that there are many words where _-ise_ is the standard spelling in both British and American; see Section 5.2.1.

**Recommendation:** When using British spelling, choose _-ize_ rather than _-ise_ for words where both are acceptable. This applies to other forms as well, e.g. _-izing_ and _-ized_.

Another choice concerns co-operate or cooperate, co-ordinate or coordinate, and related forms. In American spelling the hyphen is not used; in British spelling the hyphen is common but not using it is also acceptable, especially for the mathematical meaning of 'coordinate'.

The unit 'ton' (sometimes written 'tonne' when metric) can confuse when the US or the UK are involved--see the entry in Appendix A. (This concerns the size of the unit more than the spelling!)

The case of 'parameterise' or 'parameterize' and 'parametrise' or 'parametrize' (and similarly for other forms) presents two issues: _-is_- or _-iz_-, and _-ter_- or _-tr_-. Some references state that _-ter_- is incorrect, but others give it as the better choice. It seems acceptable to choose the more obvious _-ter_-.

**Recommendation:** Use the spelling 'parameterize', and similarly for other forms.

### Capitalization RULES and RECOMMENDATIONS

Capital letters are used to punctuate sentences, to distinguish proper nouns from other words, and in headings and titles. Capitalization is an area in which the rules are not completely rigid and tastes have evolved, with less use of capitalization now than in the past. We start with the agreed rules and then reach the less defined areas.

* The first letter of a sentence is capitalized. A complete sentence starting after a colon begins with a capital letter in American usage, but not in British (recommended).
* Proper names are capitalized, and this is useful to distinguish between a normal word and a name, e.g. 'the city of London' _vs._ 'the City' (the financial district of London). Capitalize the names of institutions, organizations, societies and groups, e.g. 'the Pergamon Museum' or 'the Institute of Physics'. Note that 'the' is not capitalized.
* Geographical locations and the names of buildings are capitalized, e.g. 'Times Square', 'the Pacific Ocean', 'the Empire State Building'.

* Names derived from people, such as 'Breit-Wigner', 'Gaussian' or 'Cabibbo angle', are capitalized. But 'fermion', 'boson', and the names of most units are _not_. (However, units named for people usually have a capitalized _symbol_. See Appendix A.) Titles of office or rank are capitalized, e.g. 'President Obama' or 'Professor Higgins'.
* The names of days of the week, months, festivals, and holidays are capitalized, e.g. 'Tuesday, 5th November', or 'Easter'. So are historical periods, e.g. 'the Renaissance'. But seasons are not, e.g.'summer'.
* When written as words, do _not_ capitalize the names of particles (e.g. neutrino), chemical elements (e.g. hydrogen), or chemical compounds (e.g. carbon dioxide).
* People often over-use capitalization. Do _not_ capitalize words for emphasis--use italics or bold type if necessary, but be sparing. Try to avoid writing specific terms, such as 'global warming', with capitals as if they were proper nouns.
* For the titles of papers, as mentioned in Section 3.1.1, capitalize just the first word and proper nouns.

**Recommendation:** Only capitalize the first word and proper nouns of the title. (That way it will be clear which words are proper nouns.)
* Capitalization of section and subsection headings follows the same convention as for the title.

**Recommendation:** Only capitalize the first word and proper nouns of section and subsection headings.
* The names of Monte Carlo simulation programs are typically written in capital letters or with \texts font (known as smallcaps).
* The names of parts of the experiment or software should be written without capitalization, e.g. 'liquid argon calorimeters' or 'run control system'.
* Similarly, do not capitalize words simply to explain an acronym.

**Recommendation:** Capitalize the proper names of specific items, but do this with restraint. Suggested ways to write many ATLAS-specific items are given in the **ATLAS Glossary**[4].

**Recommendation:** Always write 'ATLAS', never 'Atlas'.

### **Hyphenation**

Hyphens join words or parts of words (e.g.'second-rate', 'anti-nuclear'), and are sometimes essential to make the meaning clear. However, it is important to understand that in many cases there are no fixed rules. Much of the time there are other ways to write the same thing, or a hyphen is only used to make things easier to understand. Here we discuss the main situations that cause problems.

**Compound words**There are no rigid rules for compound words. Like the example given earlier ('end cap', 'end-cap' or 'endcap'), there are many cases where all three forms could be considered acceptable. In addition, the use of hyphens in compound words changes with time, especially as exotic technical jargon or new concepts become well known and evolve into single words, e.g. 'photo-multiplier' becoming 'photomultiplier'. In some cases, a hyphen is required to make the meaning clear. For example, use'single-top-quark samples' instead of'single top quark samples', as the latter could be interpreted as single samples of top-quark events.

**Recommendation:** Try to minimize the number of hyphens by using them only where necessary. Use a hyphen for compound adjectives if the meaning would be ambiguous without a hyphen.

This means considering both the 'open' form (e.g. the noun'set up') and the 'fused' single-word form ('setup') as well as the hyphenated version ('set-up'). (The _verb_ is always'set up'.) There is a tendency (not universal) for American English to use single words and British English to use two words. Sometimes the hyphenated version is preferred to avoid awkward letter combinations, e.g. 'take-off', 'part-time'. Below are some examples of open, hyphenated, and fused compound words.

* **Open:** bubble chamber, charged current, drift chamber, Monte Carlo, neutral current, Standard Model.
* **Hyphenated:** cross-section (this is controversial: hyphenation is preferred, but if unhyphenated is chosen do it consistently and hyphenate when used as a compound adjective), cross-check, cut-off, four-momentum, space-like, time-like, wave-function. (The last three are sometimes written as fused words.)
* **Fused:** ultraviolet, electrodynamics, hypercharge, infrared, isospin, photomultiplier, photoproduction, pseudorapidity, renormalization, semiconductor, superconductor, subdivision, superposition.

Note the occasional use of 'hanging' hyphens when two or more similar words are used, e.g. 'both second- and third-order differentials'. This is fine but do not do it too often.

**Prefixes and suffixes**

There are a number of prefixes and suffixes that are joined to words with hyphens, and in many cases the words pass into standard usage and lose the hyphen (but sometimes not everyone will agree).

* **Prefixes:** anti-_anything_, but antiquark and antimatter; dilepton, diboson, dijets (not everyone agrees); multi-_anything_, non-_anything_, quasi-_anything_; n-type, p-type; reentry, re-analyse, but renormalization.
* **Suffixes:** anything-_like_, anything-_less_, but wireless.

**Groups of modifiers**

A very important use of hyphens is when a string of adjectives and nouns modifies a noun. In some cases, using a hyphen simply makes it easier to grasp the meaning quickly by grouping related words. Examples of this are: 'up-to-date data', 'a wide-ranging review', 'a high-energy differential cross-section' or 'a next-to-leading-order calculation'.

But in many cases the hyphen is _essential_ to make the meaning clear, and not having the hyphen, or putting it somewhere else, actually _changes_ the meaning. Consider the following examples:

* 'Disease-causing poor nutrition' _vs._ 'disease causing poor nutrition', i.e. does poor nutrition cause the disease, or does the disease cause poor nutrition?
* 'Two year-old computers' _vs._ 'two-year-old computers, i.e. are there two computers each one year old, or some computers that are two years old?.
* 'Man eating lion seen' _vs._'man-eating lion seen', i.e. was there a man eating a lion, or a lion that likes to eat people?
* 'Cycling-friendly chief executive' _vs._ 'cycling friendly chief executive', i.e. is the chief executive sympathetic to cyclists, or is he a friendly person on a bicycle?

However, do not use more hyphens than are necessary to make the meaning clear. So 'Standard Model result' is clear without using any hyphens, and 'Standard Model cross-section' only has a hyphen because 'cross-section' is (preferably) hyphenated anyway.

One case where a string of modifiers does _not_ take a hyphen is when the modifier is an adverb, most notably ending in -\(\mathbf{ly}\). That is because it is clear what the adverb is modifying. For example, 'badly written paper' or 'newly discovered particle'.

#### 5.4.2 En-dashes

En-dashes (sometimes called 'en-rules') are a bit longer than a hyphen, nominally the width of the letter 'N'. See Section 4.2.4 for how to produce them. They have a number of uses:

* As a minus sign (do _not_ use a hyphen, it is not long enough).
* To indicate a range of values, e.g. '27-31', or 'Monday-Wednesday'.
* To join two words with some relationship, but not part of a string of adjectives, e.g. 'electron-positron annihilation', '\(p\)-\(p\) scattering', 'perman-carboniferous boundary', or'staff-student relations'.
* To join the names of joint creators or authors, e.g. 'Fermi-Dirac statistics', since a hyphen might be taken to indicate the hyphenated name of one person.
* To show the hierarchy when multiple hyphens would be confusing, e.g. 'high-priority-high-pressure tasks'.

En-dashes are normally used with no spaces between the words or characters and the en-dash (but see the last comment below on em-dashes).

#### 5.4.3 Em-dashes

Em-dashes (sometimes called 'em-rules') are considerably longer than a hyphen, nominally the width of the letter 'M'. See Section 4.2.4 for how to produce them. They are used in two ways:

* Like parentheses but indicating more emphasis, e.g. 'The repair took--we knew it would--far longer than planned'.
* To introduce a phrase at the end of a sentence, instead of using a colon, mainly as an afterthought or an aside, e.g. 'That publisher accepts material from most people--basically, anyone with money'.

Traditionally, em-dashes are put between words with no spaces. However, many publishers now put spaces around the dash but use an en-dash instead of an em-dash - like this. Whichever you choose, do it consistently.

### Punctuation

#### 5.5.1 Commas

Commas, like hyphens, are an area where usage is often a question of taste rather than rigid rules. In addition to clarifying the meaning of a sentence, they are also useful in breaking up long sentences to make them easier to understand quickly.

**Recommendation:** Try to minimize the use of commas to what is needed to ensure there is no ambiguity in the meaning, and to make sentences easier to understand.

Commas are used to set off 'non-restrictive', 'non-defining', or parenthetical clauses that add information not strictly essential to the sentence, e.g. 'The valley's people, who are Catholic, speak French.' On the other hand, essential information ('restrictive' or 'defining' clauses) should not have commas, e.g. 'The people who are on shift are really worried about this.' (Try putting commas around 'who are on shift' to see how it changes the meaning.)

Do not use a comma to join two main clauses of a sentence linked by an adverb such as 'therefore' or 'nevertheless', so 'He was tired, nevertheless he went on shift as usual.' is incorrect. Instead use either a semicolon ('He was tired; nevertheless he went on shift as usual.'), or use a conjunction such as 'and', 'but', or'so' ('He was tired, but he went on shift as usual.').

Adverbs such as 'however', 'therefore' and 'already' should usually be followed by a comma when at the beginning of a sentence, and enclosed in commas when in the middle, e.g. 'However, the other method of analysis...' and 'There was, however, one important difference'. An exception to this is when qualifying an adjective or adverb, for example 'However much work you do...'.

A controversial point is the use of commas before 'and' and 'or' at the end of a list of items. This is called an 'Oxford' and even a 'Harvard' comma, though many other publishers also use it. Examples are'mad, bad, and dangerous to know' and 'Birmingham, Heidelberg, Mainz, or Stockholm universities'. Omitting the final comma in these examples is also correct, and would not change the meaning. However, there arecases where the comma is definitely needed to make the meaning clear. Compare 'She took photographs of her parents, the president, and the vice president' with 'She took photographs of her parents, the president and the vice president'. It is not clear whether the second sentence is saying that the president and vice president are her parents or not.

#### 5.5.2 Semicolons and colons

The semicolon is a separator that is stronger than a comma but does not end a sentence.

* Use a semicolon to divide clauses that could stand as sentences in their own right, but are better left in the same sentence because one explains or complements the other, e.g. 'Some of the students were brilliant; others were less so.' or 'The cooling pipes go through the gap in the detector; the signal cables follow the same route.'
* In a sentence already subdivided by commas, a semicolon indicates a stronger division, e.g. 'They pointed out that they had used the equipment required; had taken every reasonable precaution, including some not mentioned in the manual; and that the program had been written by qualified programmers, all very experienced.'
* In a list where some elements already contain commas, use semicolons to clarify the relationships, e.g. 'This work was supported by BMBF, Germany; The Swedish Research Council, Sweden; and the Science and Technology Facilities Council, United Kingdom.'

The colon points forward, with the same function as words like 'namely', 'that is', 'as', 'for example', 'because' or 'therefore'.

* The material following a colon does not have to be able to stand alone as a sentence, e.g. 'It is available in two colours: white or black.'
* The colon can be used to introduce a list, e.g. 'We need the following: a computer, some diagnostic software, an oscilloscope, and a logic analyser.'
* Do not use a colon followed by other linking words to introduce a list or statement, e.g. 'She outlined the lives of three physicists, namely, Planck, Heisenberg, and Dirac.' However, you can use a colon if it is _after_ the link word, e.g. 'She gave an example: the Dirac equation.'
* Both a colon and an em-dash can be used to introduce a phrase at the end of a sentence, but the em-dash is less formal and often implies an afterthought or an aside.
* Do not put a space before a colon.

#### 5.5.3 Apostrophes

The apostrophe has two main uses. The first, usually together with an's', indicates possession, e.g. _Maxwell's distribution_. The second use indicates that letters have been omitted in a word, e.g. _don't_ for _do not_, or _I've_ for _I have_. A guideline for formal writing is to try to minimize the use of such contractions. (In this section, examples are in italics rather than quotation marks to make the use of apostrophes more obvious.)

* The possessive for words ending in's' can be confusing. Add an's' after the apostrophe if the result is easy to pronounce, but not if it is awkward (e.g. _Jones's data_ but _Archimedes' Principle_). This is an area where people disagree, so use your judgement.
* The possessive for plurals ending in's' can be confusing. A general recommendation is to use the apostrophe but omit the extra's'. As an indication of the subtleties, compare the singular and plural usage in the following four phrases: _my sister's friend's studies; my sisters' friends' studies; my sisters' friend's studies; my sister's friends' studies_.
* A special case concerns periods of time, e.g. _two days' time_, _six weeks' holiday_.
* People understandably get very confused about _its_ and _it's_. _Its_ without an apostrophe is the possessive. _It's_ with an apostrophe is short for _it_ is; this looks like a possessive but is not. However, it has unfortunately become increasingly common for popular publications to be sloppy about this, and _it's_ is being used more and more often as a possessive.
* Do not use apostrophes to indicate plural acronyms, e.g. _RODs_ not _ROD's_. (Not everyone agrees with this--apostrophes used to be normal usage.)
* Apostrophes can be used to indicate plurals of single letters and Greek letters, especially when not using an apostrophe would be unclear or ambiguous. However, avoid using an apostrophe for plurals of particles as in '\(\pi^{0}\)'s', use '\(\pi^{0}\)'s' instead.
* Never use the incorrect 'greengrocer's apostrophe' for plurals. This gets its name from shops which incorrectly label items with words like _lettuce's_, or _video's_. The apostrophe is not needed for plural words. It should only be used when there is a need for clarity, e.g. _dot the i's and cross the t's_, or _subtract all the x's from all the y's_.

#### 5.5.4 Quotation marks

Single ('...') and double ("...") quotation marks, often called 'inverted commas' in British English, are another area where American usage is well defined but British usage presents a choice. See Section 4.2.4 for how to type proper 'curly' quotation marks. (In this section, examples are in italics rather than quotation marks to make the use of quotation marks more obvious.)

Traditional British practice is to enclose quoted matter in single quotation marks, and to use double quotation marks for a quotation within a quotation. This is completely reversed in American writing, and now also in much British writing (notably newspapers and magazines). For example, '_Have youany idea', she said, 'what "red mercury" is?'_ would be traditional British, while _"Have you any idea", she said, "what'red mercury' is?"_ would be American, or nowadays much British, usage. Unless the journal requires the older British usage, double quotation marks are recommended when enclosing quoted material.

Quotation marks are also used for the first occurrence of an unfamiliar or newly invented word or phrase, or one used in a technical sense, e.g. _the birth, or 'calving' of an iceberg_, or _This scheme is called 'bunch-crossing multiplexing'_.

Finally, quotation marks can be used to distance the writer from a point of view, a claim, or an expression, e.g. _the organization of 'voluntary' night shifts_.

### Miscellaneous items

#### 5.6.1 Plurals

Here we are concerned with two different aspects of plurals: whether some things are singular or plural, and how to form the plurals of some words.

**Recommendation:** Data should be considered as plural (with the rarely used singular 'datum'), e.g. 'the data were analysed'.

Sometimes people refer to data as singular, e.g. 'the data was analysed'. This is not strictly wrong, and if you do it be sure to be consistent, but it is not the favoured usage.

**Recommendation:** A collaboration, organization or company should usually be treated as singular, e.g. 'ATLAS has decided to...', not plural, e.g. 'ATLAS have decided to...'.

Although many English words simply add an's' for the plural, there are numerous others that do other things. Some add _-es_, e.g. 'wishes', 'patches', or 'tomatoes'. And some plurals do not have an's' at all, e.g. 'children' or'sheep'.

The possessive form of plural nouns, and how apostrophes are used, is discussed in Section 5.5.3. The generally accepted way to form plural acronyms is to add an's', but without any apostrophe, e.g. 'RODS'. Never use the 'greenrocer's apostrophe' (again see Section 5.5.3).

Plurals of non-English words are in a state of change. Do you say 'formulas' or 'formulae','stadiums' or'stadia', 'bureaus' or 'bureaux','referendums' or'referenda'?

**Recommendation:** Use English forms of the plural (the first in each example) instead of the non-English one when they exist. Note, however, that 'alumni' and 'nuclei' remain standard usage.

To make matters more confusing there is 'index'. Referring to many books we might talk of 'indexes', but for a mathematical expression use 'indices' for the plural. A similar word is'vertex', for which the plural is'vertices'.

A very common mistake, made nowadays by many native English speakers, is to use the plural 'criteria' instead of the singular 'criterion' if there is only one. Similarly, the singular of'media' is'medium', and the singular of 'phenomena' is 'phenomenon'. It is _wrong_ to say 'a criteria', 'this storage media' or 'that phenomena'.

#### 5.6.2 Which vs. that

This is a common confusion. For a'restrictive' clause, i.e. one that defines something or restricts the scope, 'that' can be used. In British English, but _not_ American, 'which' can also be used. So for example, 'all tracks that were not identified as coming from conversions were combined with tracks of positive charge' since you are restricting the tracks to those not coming from conversions. On the other hand, for a 'non-restrictive' clause that simply adds information, 'which' can be used but _never_ 'that'. For example, 'cell clusters were also formed, which were then used to aid in electron identification' gives additional information without defining a subset.

#### 5.6.3 Split infinitives

A split infinitive occurs when you put an adverb in the middle of an infinitive, rather than before or after it. One of the best known examples comes from _Star Trek_: 'To boldly go where no man has gone before.' Many people believe that split infinitives are wrong or are bad style, but they are not. They tend to be used more in American than British English. Try to avoid using them if it is easy and the result sounds good, simply in order to avoid unnecessary arguments. But in some cases avoiding a split infinitive sounds awkward, or less strong. How would you re-write 'we expect our recorded data to more than double by next year'? In such cases use the split infinitive.

#### 5.6.4 Homophones

These are many pairs of words that sound the same but are spelled differently, and have _different_ meanings. Even native English speakers get these wrong very often. Here are some common ones:

* affect _vs._ effect: to produce an effect on something or someone _vs._ the result of an action. For example, 'Exhoritations in the style guide had no effect (_noun_) on the number of mistakes; the level of mistakes was not affected (_verb_) by exhoritations in the style guide; we hope to effect (_verb_) a change in this.' (_Guardian Style Guide_)
* complement _vs._ compliment: to make complete _vs._ praise.
* discreet _vs._ discrete: tactful or circumspect _vs._ separate.
* principal _vs._ principle: first in rank or importance _vs._ fundamental truth, rule or standard of conduct.
* stationary _vs._ stationery: not moving or changing _vs._ writing materials.
* there _vs._ their: a place or position _vs._ belonging to them.

#### 5.6.5 A vs. an

The two forms of indefinite article, 'a' and 'an', are meant to make things sound good. The basic rule is to use 'a' before words starting with a consonant and 'an' before vowels.

A big exception is for words beginning with 'h', which is often silent. So we write 'a hadron' but 'an hour'. However, a few words are sometimes pronounced with a silent 'h' but sometimes not, e.g. 'herb' (silent 'h' in American but not in British)--in these cases 'a' or 'an' becomes a matter of taste. (In the past we were taught to write things like 'an hotel', but that is no longer fashionable; it now depends on pronunciation.)

There are some words beginning with a vowel that is pronounced like a consonant, so use 'a' (e.g. 'a unit'). And there are cases where a consonant sounds as if it begins with a vowel, such as 'an \(x\)-dependence'.

#### 5.6.6 Some common abbreviations

There are a number of'standard' abbreviations that you can assume readers will understand. However, do not overdo it, especially since many readers will not be native English speakers, and if you have any doubts then spell them out.

You can assume familiarity with widely known abbreviations such as 'UN', 'US', 'UK', and CERN, as well as 'AD' and 'BC' to specify the era. Other abbreviations should be defined on their first appearance.

Some Latin-based abbreviations are often used to make English a bit more compact. There is no need to write these in italics. They include:

* etc. (_et cetera_) = and other things
* et al. (_et alii_) = and others (some publishers do put this in italics)
* i.e. (_id est_) = that is
* e.g. (_exempli gratia_) = for example
* N.B. (_nota bene_) = note well
* cf. (_confer_) = compare

Rarer forms that now tend to be discouraged are 'viz' (_videlicet_) meaning 'namely', and 'ibid.' (_ibidem_) meaning 'in the same place' and used for references.

If a sentence ends on an abbreviation (e.g. 'etc.') use only one full stop (period), _not_ two.

#### 5.6.7 Miscellaneous RECOMMENDATIONS for ATLAS and physics-related items

* Note the difference between particles (the underlying physical objects) and the measured quantities such as tracks or clusters.
* CERN policy is to refer to the mechanism for electroweak symmetry breaking as the 'Englert-Brout-Higgs' or 'EBH' mechanism. However, the boson is simply the 'Higgs boson' (and not just 'the Higgs').
* If you have to use phrases like 'Higgs boson mass' a lot you might use the full form the first time, but then just 'Higgs mass'.
* Higgs boson production processes should be written as 'gluon-gluon fusion' not 'gluon fusion', and'vector-boson fusion (VBF)' not 'weak-boson fusion'.
* '\(B\)-physics' (not '\(b\)-physics'), but '\(b\)-tagging', '\(b\)-quarks', '\(b\)-jets'.
* Write 'Standard Model' capitalized. Do not abbreviate it in the abstract. If it occurs often, write it out the first time you use it and define the abbreviation: 'Standard Model (SM)'. Likewise, 'MSSM' is acceptable but define it on first use.
* In physics 'Monte Carlo' is an adjective, so it should _always_ be followed by a noun (e.g. 'Monte Carlo simulation'). Using 'Monte Carlo' on its own as a noun (e.g. 'corrections obtained from Monte Carlo') could imply the city of that name.
* The terms 'confidence level' (frequentist/CLs) or 'credibility level' (Bayesian) can be abbreviated to 'CL' (but define it on first use); note that it is 'level' not 'limit'. Writing it as 'C.L.' is discouraged.
* Use the notation \(\mathrm{CL}_{\mathrm{s}}\) to refer to the CLs method, i.e. standard text font even for the subscript as in \(\mathrm{CL}\_{\backslash}\)text{\{\$\$}}.
* An upper case 'K' is preferred for \(K\)-factor.
* Avoid such ATLAS-specific jargon as 'truth particle' (and 'truth' in general), 'AOD', 'CSC', 'ESD', 'containers', etc.
* The LHC run between 2009 and 2013 is referred to as 'Run 1'. The run from 2015 is 'Run 2'. Note the use of arabic numerals rather than roman ones.
* Use 'Powheg' or 'POWHEG', never 'PowHeg'. Distinguish between the 'POWHEG' method (implemented in many Monte Carlo programs) and the 'POWHEG-BOX' program.
* Avoid 'fake leptons' to mean either fake leptons or real leptons from hadron decays. Define the term where it first appears in the paper with 'jets misidentified as leptons or non-prompt leptons from decays of hadrons'.
* Background events from jet production is often referred to as 'QCD background'. Since QCD is the theory of strong interactions rather than a source of background, such events should be referred to as'multijet background'.

* Avoid 'charged tracks' and write 'charged-particle tracks' instead.
* The shorthand notation for 'liquid argon' is 'LAr', not 'LAR' or 'Lar' or 'Larg'.
* A 'calorimeter cluster' is a cluster of calorimeters. Viable alternatives are 'cluster of energy deposits' or 'calorimeter energy clusters'.
* Squark names should be: 'top squark', 'bottom squark', etc. It is fine to define'stop' as a shorthand for 'top squark' but'stop quark' should not be used.

#### 5.6.8 Common mistakes by non-native English speakers

Languages have many subtle points, so it is not surprising that even people who have learned a language well and speak it very fluently will still make small mistakes in writing it. The actual mistakes of course depend on the person's native language, but there are some constructions that come up commonly at CERN that are perhaps worth pointing out.

* 'Since five years' should be something like 'for five years' or 'five years ago', depending on the exact situation.
* 'Allows to measure' should be something like 'allows measurement of'.
* 'Until Friday' or 'till Friday' should often be replaced with 'by Friday'.
* 'Built' is often used incorrectly instead of 'build'. 'Built' is the past of the verb 'to build', and the present tense is 'build'. The computer jargon term is 'nightly build'. Similarly for'sent' and'send'.
* 'How xx looks like' should either be 'how xx looks' or 'what xx looks like'.
* 'For what concerns xx' should be 'concerning xx', 'as regards xx', or 'as far as xx is concerned'.
* 'As it is the case' should be 'as is the case'--do not use 'it' in this way.
* 'This shows how bad the tracks were aligned'--should say 'badly'; similarly for'seriously', 'precisely', etc.
* At the start of a sentence 'As for' is equivalent to 'With regard to' rather than 'Like for'.
* 'With respect to' is equivalent to 'As regards' or 'Concerning'. It is not equivalent to 'Relative to'. The sentence 'The two proposals are similar with respect to cost' is correct but 'transverse impact parameter with respect to the primary vertex' should be 'transverse impact parameter relative to the primary vertex'.
* The phrasing 'associated to' often should be 'associated with' when referring to an existing or inherent relation. Use'matched to' or 'assigned to' when referring to an action.

There is a useful CERN page [14] on avoiding 'franglais', useful not only for native French speakers but also for many others (including some native English speakers!) who have been at CERN for a long time.

#### 5.6.9 Other points of English

* Use 'alternatively' rather than 'alternately', unless you mean something that alternates.
* Do not use 'essentially' (fundamentally or basically) to mean 'effectively' or 'approximately'.
* Do not confuse 'imply' (strongly suggests) with 'infer' (deduce from facts and reasoning).
* To make certain of or to guarantee something, British usage is 'ensure' and American is either 'insure' or 'ensure'. (But if it concerns insurance it is always 'insure'.)
* If something has been lost you 'lose' it, you do not 'loose' it. 'Loose' means 'not tight'. (This mistake is very common in British writing.)
* The past of 'to lead' is 'led', not 'lead' (unlike'read', the past of 'to read').
* Use 'allows', not 'allows for', if you mean something is permitted or enabled. For example, 'doing this allows changes due to ageing to be estimated'. 'Allows for' means you have considered something that is possible but not certain, for example 'the error quoted allows for possible changes due to ageing'.
* 'Presently' means'soon', and in US usage can also mean 'now'. 'Momentarily' means 'for a moment', and in US usage can also mean 'at any moment'. If you want to be certain that your meaning is clear, it might be best to avoid using either of these.
* The wordings 'in case of' and 'in the case of' do not have the same meaning, usually the desired meaning is 'in the case of' or 'for'.
* Avoid 'The agreement between data and simulation is good' since 'The agreement' is like 'The treaty' or 'The contract'. A better formulation would be 'Good agreement between the data and simulation is found' or 'The data and simulation agree well', although it is preferred to describe the degree of agreement in terms of the uncertainty as in 'The data and simulation agree within uncertainties'.
* Avoid 'To quantify the compatibility between the data and the background-only hypothesis' since compatibility is not a continuous variable. It is better to write 'To determine the probability that the data is compatible with the background-only hypothesis'.

There is a useful list containing more terms which are commonly misused on the CERN web pages on style [14].

## Appendix B Appendix: Abridged recommendations

Below is a summary of the most important recommendations. However, editors are encouraged to read the complete set of recommendations in the body of this document.

### Elements of a paper

* The title must be consise, clear and descriptive, and should include the word 'ATLAS'.
* Only the first word and all proper nouns should be capitalized.
* The title should not be identical to that of a previous paper.
* If the integrated luminosity is included in the title, round to the nearest fb\({}^{-1}\) (e.g. write 36 fb\({}^{-1}\)).

* The abstract should be just one paragraph, at most a third of a page long, and should stand on its own.
* State what was measured, where it was done, what data set and methods were used, what the primary results are.
* Write the abstract to raise interest in the paper but avoid overstating the significance of the results.
* Avoid defining symbols or abbreviations, if at all possible.

* Except for PRL, the text should be organized in sections, which typically include introduction, theory, experimental setup, Monte Carlo model, event reconstruction and selection, systematic uncertainties, statistical analysis, and results.

* Reiterate main points of paper and primary results.
* Provide general experimental context (LHC, ATLAS, \(\sqrt{s}\), integrated luminosity, final state, etc.).
* State importance of the results.

* Include the latest version of the acknowledgements from Ref. [7].
* Special requests to acknowledge individuals need to be sent to the PubCom Chair.

* Follow recommendations from Ref. [6].
* Maximize visibility of data and simulation distributions, e.g. minimize the amount of empty vertical space.
* All axes must be labelled, including units given in square brackets.
* Include a legend with entries matching the stacking order of histograms.
* Font size should be large enough for text to be readable when used in a presentation.
* Notation used in the figures should be consistent with the main text of the paper.
* Plots with data should contain 'ATLAS' or 'ATLAS Preliminary' inside each figure. For plots with only simulation, it should be 'ATLAS Simulation' or 'ATLAS Simulation Preliminary'.
* Include a label in the format '\(\sqrt{s}\) = 13 TeV, 36 fb\({}^{-1}\)', as appropriate.
* Place figures at the top of the page, else place at the bottom of the page if it is not possible at the top.
* The caption must be placed below the plots.
* The caption must define the variables shown.
* Subcaptions are not recommended other than to distinguish (a), (b), etc.
* Figures should not appear in or after the Conclusions section, add \FloatBarrier before the Conclusions section.
* Always use the full word 'Figure'.

* Rows/columns should have proper labels and have units in square brackets.
* Place tables at the top of the page, if at all possible.
* The caption must be placed above the table.
* The caption must define the variables shown.

* Use the standard bib files in the atlaslater package for ATLAS and CMS papers, as well as ATLAS CONF and PUB notes. For example, use \cite{EXOT-2015-11} for papers, \cite{ATLAS-CONF-2016-039} for CONF notes, and \cite{ATL-PHYS-PUB-2014-021} for PUB notes.
* Only public documents may be cited, no internal document or private communication.
* Preliminary results from CONF/PUB notes may not be cited in physics papers, but performance CONF/PUB notes may be cited if no corresponding paper is available.
* Include digital object identifier (doi) and arXiv reference (without version number).
* Example of correct formatting: 'R. D. Ball et al., Parton distributions with LHC data, Nucl. Phys. B **867*
* (2013) 244, arXiv: 1207.1303 [hep-ph]'; note that bibtex files from INSPIRE tend to include journal letters like the 'B' here in the volume number but it should be included in the journal name instead for 'B' not to be bold.

### Layout, styles, and typography

* Use the ATLAS standard preprint formatting provided in the latest version of the atlaslater package [3].
* Sections should be referred to with the full word 'Section'.

* Use the macros defined in atlasphysics.sty for particle symbols, variables, etc. Find more information in Ref. [16].
* Write out integers from one to ten, use digits for integers 11 and higher.
* Use digits for decimals, percentages, and when there are units.
* Do not start a sentence with a digit or symbol.
* Variables should always be written in italics (or in math mode).
* Subscripts and superscripts in variables should not use italics if they are not variables themselves, e.g. \(p_{\rm T}\) and \(E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}\).
* Number rounding should follow the recommendations in Ref. [17]. Usually, one adopts either using two significant figures or the PDG rounding rules [18].
* Use a non-breaking space to force text including a space to stay together on the same line. Examples include a number with its associated unit, 'Figure', 'Table', or 'Section' with their associated number. For a non-breaking space, type the character '-'.
* Use SI units and their preferred (powers of \(10^{3}\)) prefixes.
* Use punctuation for all equations.
* Refer to specific equations with 'Eq. (3)' or 'Equation (3) if at the beginning of a sentence.
* Capitalize and punctuate lists as if they were normal sentences.

### English usage

* **General considerations*
* Use British English for European journals and American English for American journals.
* Generally use present tense but use past tense for statements whose validity is in the past like the data taking or the generation of Monte Carlo simulation samples.
* Avoid use of personal pronouns like 'we'.
* Avoid use of jargon as in 'Higgs-like','monojet-like', or 'cut'.
* Avoid long sentences.
* **Physics-related recommendations*
* The term 'Monte Carlo' is an adjective and should always be followed by a noun, e.g. 'Monte Carlo simulation'.
* The boson discovered in 2012 is 'the Higgs boson' rather than 'the Higgs'.
* Write 'Standard Model' capitalized.
* The different LHC running periods are denoted 'Run 1', 'Run 2', etc.
* Define 'fake leptons' in terms of their origin and avoid using the term to mean both fake leptons or real leptons from hadron decays.
* Background event from jet production should be referred to as'multijet background' rather than 'QCD background'.
* Avoid 'charged tracks', write 'charged-particle tracks' instead.
* Avoid 'calorimeter cluster', write 'cluster of energy deposits' or 'calorimeter energy clusters'.
* Squark names should follow the example of 'top squark', never'stop quark'. It is fine to define'stop' as shorthand for 'top squark'.
* **Other recommendations*
* Use all capital letters for acronyms, as in 'ATLAS'.
* Only capitalize the first word and proper nouns of the title.
* Capitalization of section and subsection headings follows the same convention as for the title.
* Minimize the number of hyphens and use them only when the meaning would be ambiguous without a hyphen.
* Use en-dashes (two dashes in latex) to indicate a range of values, join two words with some relationship as in 'electron-positron annihilation' or join the names of joint creators as in 'Fermi-Dirac statistics'.
* Use em-dashes (three dashes in latex) as an equivalent to parentheses or to introduce a phrase at the end of the sentence.
* Minimize the use of commas to what is needed to ensure there is no ambiguity in the meaning, and to make sentences easier to understand.
