**Collaboration Board decisions on ATLAS organization in 1998/1999**

Matteo Cavalli-Sforza

Decisions taken by the Collaboration Board in 1998 and 1999 on matters of organization of the collaboration are collated in this document for ease of reference.

These decisions complete the rules and procedures laid down in the ATLAS Organization document [1] and in the ATLAS System Organization document [2] and together with these two documents define the basic rules under which ATLAS operates.

## 1 Procedure approved in the Collaboration Board meeting of September 18, 1998:

### Concerning elections in which two candidates receive equal numbers of votes:

The procedure to be followed to break a deadlock in the Collaboration Board is described. This procedure is also meant as a guide if such a situation arises in (sub)detector communities.

In the case that two candidates receive equal numbers of votes

1. First, the election shall be repeated in the same session.
2. If the deadlock is not broken, the body that organized the previous vote shall have the authority to propose solutions that may produce a majority, and shall organize an other vote. This vote must be announced at least two weeks in advance and must follow the previous vote with a delay of no less than three weeks.
3. If the deadlock persists, the Collaboration Board Chair shall be entrusted with finding a solution.

Rules approved in the Collaboration Board meetings of June 11, 1999 and September 16, 1999:

## Appendix A Concerning (sub)system project leaders:

A search committee of the Institute Board presents a short list of project leader candidates after consulting with the (sub)system community and management. The spokesperson may add one candidate to the short list. Before the Institute Board vote, the Spokesperson may express to the Institute Board management's preferences between the candidates. (11/06/99)

In exceptional circumstances, the spokesperson may call for the resignation of a (sub)system project leader. In this case, a new election must take place within 30 days. The outgoing project leader remains in charge until the new one is elected. (16/09/99)

## Appendix B Concerning decisions by Institute Boards:

In constructing detector components, majority decisions of the Institute Boards must be followed by all Institutes. However under serious circumstances majority decision can be appealed. Such appeals will be arbitrated by the spokesperson, and may only be reversed by a vote of the Collaboration Board. (11/06/99)

## Appendix C Concerning rejections of outgoing spokesperson and project leaders:

If the outgoing spokesperson/(sub)system project leader has served for two terms or longer and seeks reelection, the relevant search committee should actively seek new candidates. (16/09/99)

Elections of (sub)system project leaders should normally take place at least four months before the end of the mandate of the current project leaders. (16/09/99)
