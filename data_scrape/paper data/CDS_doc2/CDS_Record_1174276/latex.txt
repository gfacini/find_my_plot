[10mm] _This note is part of CERN-OPEN-2008-020. This version of the note should not be cited: all citations should be to CERN-OPEN-2008-020._The discovery of a charged Higgs boson would be tangible proof of physics beyond the Standard Model. This note presents the ATLAS potential for discovering a charged Higgs boson, utilizing five different final states of the signal arising from the three dominating fermionic decay modes of the charged Higgs boson. The search covers the region below the top quark mass, taking into account the present experimental constraints, the transition region with a charged Higgs boson mass of the order of the top quark mass, and the high-mass region with a charged Higgs boson mass up to 600 GeV. All studies are performed with a realistic simulation of the detector response including all three trigger levels and taking into account all dominant systematic uncertainties. Results are given in terms of discovery and exclusion contours for each channel individually and for all channels combined, showing that the ATLAS experiment is capable of detecting the charged Higgs boson in a significant fraction of the (\(\tan\beta\), \(m_{H^{\pm}}\)) parameter space with its first 10 fb\({}^{-1}\) of data. The so-called intermediate \(\tan\beta\) region (around \(\bar{t}=7\)) is experimentally hard to reach but exclusion sensitivity is given in this area.

Introduction

Charged Higgs bosons (\(H^{\pm}\))2) are naturally predicted in many non-minimal Higgs scenarios, such as Two Higgs Doublet Models (2HDM), and models with Higgs triplets including Little Higgs models. Their discovery would be a definite signal for the existence of New Physics beyond the Standard Model, possibly the first experimental evidence for the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) if it is realised in nature, and the supersymmetry mass scale is high enough that sparticles escape discovery. The following analyses will only consider the 2HDM, in particular the so-called type II-2HDM, which is the Higgs sector of the MSSM.

Footnote 2): In the following, the charged Higgs boson will be denoted \(H^{+}\), but \(H^{-}\) is always implicitly included.

The search strategies for charged Higgs bosons depend on their hypothesized mass, which dictates both the production rate and the available decay modes. Below the top quark mass, the main production mode is through top quark decays, \(t\to H^{+}b\), and in this range the \(H^{+}\rightarrow\tau\nu\) decay mode is dominant. Above the top quark threshold, production mainly takes place through gb fusion (\(gb\to tH^{+}\)), and for such high charged Higgs boson masses the decay into a top quark and a \(b\) quark dominates, \(H^{+}\to tb\). A more detailed discussion of the different signal final states used for this study including backgrounds, cross-sections and branching ratios can be found in Reference [1].

Charged Higgs boson searches involve several higher level reconstructed physics objects such as electrons, muons, jets, jets tagged as \(b\) jets and finally jets identified as \(\tau\) jets. These objects are reconstructed by dedicated ATLAS algorithms and details about their performance can be found in References [2, 3, 4, 5, 6]. In the following, only efficiencies will be quoted for the different objects.

The note is organized as follows: Section 2 summarizes the trigger menus used for the signatures under investigation. The analysis sections are divided into light (Section 3) and heavy (Section 4) \(H^{+}\) studies, which are in turn divided according to the signal final state: First, \(t\bar{t}\to bH^{+}bW\to b\tau(had)\nu bqq\) is discussed in Section 3.1, then \(t\bar{t}\to bH^{+}bW\to b\tau(lep)\nu bqq\) in Section 3.2. Section 3.3 addresses \(t\bar{t}\to bH^{+}bW\to b\tau(had)\nu b\ell\nu\). Two studies for heavy \(H^{+}\) are described, namely for \(gg/gb\to t[b]H^{+}\to bqq[b]\tau(had)\nu\) (Section 4.1) and \(gg/gb\to t[b]H^{+}\to t[b]tb\to bW[b]bWb\to b\ell\nu[b]bqqb\) (Section 4.2). In Section 5, systematic uncertainties and their impact are discussed, followed by a description of the data-driven \(t\bar{t}\) control sample method which is needed for the extraction of the background shape and normalization in all \(H^{+}\) studies. Section 6 provides combined results from the different search topologies. The charged Higgs boson results are summarized in Section 7.

## 2 Trigger

The production and decay modes of the charged Higgs boson studied here lead to final states containing the following: two to four \(b\) jets, light jets from hadronic decays of \(W\) bosons, one or more neutrinos from \(W\) or \(H^{+}\) decays, and for most channels a tau lepton decaying either hadronically or into an electron or muon plus neutrinos. These event characteristics suggest the following ATLAS Trigger [7] menus, one for an instantaneous luminosity of \(L=10^{31}\)cm\({}^{-2}\)s\({}^{-1}\), and two alternatives for \(L=10^{33}\)cm\({}^{-2}\)s\({}^{-1}\), based on these trigger signatures:

* \(L=10^{31}\)cm\({}^{-2}\)s\({}^{-1}\): xE70, e22i, mu20, xE30_L1_TAU13, xE20_3j20_L1_TAU13
* \(L=10^{33}\)cm\({}^{-2}\)s\({}^{-1}\): xE80, e55, mu40, xE50_L1_TAU30, xE40_3j20_L1_TAU30 or
* xE80, e22i_xE30, mu20_xE30, xE50_L1_TAU30, xE40_3j20_L1_TAU30

where xE represents a missing transverse energy trigger selection, and e, mu, tau and j correspond to electron, muon, tau, and jet triggers, respectively. A number before each symbol indicates the required trigger multiplicity, as in 3j for three jets. Values after these symbols are the approximate trigger thresholds in transverse momentum, and a final i means that isolation requirements are applied. L1_ indicatesthat the stated threshold for the following trigger selection is applied at the first trigger level while the high level trigger selection is softer. Combined triggers are indicated by the juxtaposition of two or more selections. Each analysis uses a subset of items of the two \(10^{33}\) menus.

The menus were chosen based on a careful study of the signal event characteristics and the most realistic trigger signature rates available. The chosen signatures meet the requirements of the trigger bandwidth budget [7] at all trigger levels. For each of the channels studied in the following sections, the trigger efficiencies will be evaluated.

## 3 Light Charged Higgs Boson Searches

In this section, charged Higgs boson searches in the three light \(H^{+}\) channels (\(m_{H^{+}}<m_{t}\)) selected for investigation are presented:

* \(t\bar{t}\to bH^{+}bW\to b\tau(had)\nu bqq\)
* \(t\bar{t}\to bH^{+}bW\to b\tau(lep)\nu bqq\)
* \(t\bar{t}\to bH^{+}bW\to b\tau(had)\nu b\ell\nu\)

where for a tau lepton, \(\tau(had)\) indicates its hadronic decay and \(\tau(lep)\) its decay to an electron or muon plus neutrinos. If the charged Higgs boson is light, then BR(\(t\to bW\)) might not be close to unity, as it is in the Standard Model prediction. This means that the expected background from Standard Model \(t\bar{t}\) decays (the dominant background to all \(H^{+}\) searches) is reduced. Since the number of events after the event selection is \(N_{t\bar{t}}^{\rm SM}\) for the background-only hypothesis, and \(N_{H^{+}}+N_{t\bar{t}}^{\rm MSSM}\) in the signal+background case, the number of observable excess events is thus not simply the number of \(H^{+}\) events (\(N_{H^{+}}\)) -- it is decreased by the difference in the SM and the MSSM \(t\bar{t}\) prediction: \(N_{excess}=N_{H^{+}}-(N_{t\bar{t}}^{\rm SM}-N_{t\bar{t}}^{\rm MSSM})\). This is taken into account consistently.

All plots, tables and results in this section are based on the trigger menu for an instantaneous luminosity of L=\(10^{33}\)cm\({}^{-2}\)s\({}^{-1}\) presented in Section 2, on the signal cross-sections for the \(m_{h}\)-max MSSM scenario (see Reference [1]) and the background cross-sections given in Reference [8].

### \(t\bar{t}\to bH^{+}bW\to b\tau(had)\nu bqq\)

The channel in which both the \(\tau\) and the \(W\) boson decay hadronically has a relatively high cross-section, making it a priori one of the most promising in searches for \(H^{+}\) lighter than the top quark. On the other hand, the absence of leptons, as well as the high hadronic activity, is a challenge, particularly for the trigger. The events are characterised by a \(\tau\) jet, four other jets, two of which are initiated by \(b\) quarks, and missing energy. The main expected backgrounds for this channel are \(t\bar{t}\) events where one top quark decays hadronically and the other to a hadronically decaying \(\tau\). For this study all \(t\bar{t}\) decay modes have been considered as background, as well as single top, \(W\)+jets and QCD dijet events. For ATLAS, this channel has previously only been studied using fast simulation [9].

#### 3.1.1 Preselection

TriggerEither the xE50_L1_TAU30 or the xE40_3j20_L1_TAU30 trigger signature (see Section 2) is required for this study.

Cuts IFollowing the trigger, a set of cuts was used to preselect the signal and suppress the background. This first cut set relates primarily to the multiplicity of the offline analysis objects (which are different from the trigger objects, leading in some cases to lower optimum cut values for the offline objects). These are given in Table 3.1.1.

Cuts IIAfter the first set of cuts, the \(W\) is reconstructed from the pair of light jets with invariant mass \(m_{jj}\) closest to the nominal \(W\) mass, \(m_{W}\). The parent top quark is then found by pairing the reconstructed \(W\) with the \(b\) quark which leads to an apparent top quark mass \(m_{jjb}\) closest to the nominal value \(m_{t}\). Cuts are made both on the \(W\) and the top quark reconstructed masses. The top quark on the \(H^{+}\) side cannot be fully reconstructed due to the presence of the neutrino, but information on its azimuthal angle, \(\phi\), and transverse momentum, \(p_{T}\), can still be extracted.

At this stage a large number of background events still remains, mainly from Standard Model \(t\bar{t}\) as well as from QCD and single-top production. In order to discriminate against the latter two, two cuts (items 8 and 9 in Table 1) are applied aiming to enhance the topology of \(t\bar{t}\) decays.

#### 3.1.2 Likelihood Discriminant

Following these cuts, the remaining background is dominated by \(t\bar{t}\) events, particularly those in which one \(W\) decays hadronically and the other to a \(\tau\) and a neutrino, and all reducible backgrounds are effectively suppressed. In order to discriminate between this background and the signal, a Likelihood Discriminant

Figure 1: \(t\bar{t}\to bH^{+}bW\to b\tau(had)\nu bqq\): Likelihood distribution (a) and transverse mass (b) for an \(H^{+}\) mass of 130 GeV and the corresponding background, stacked and normalized to the cross-section with \(\tan\beta=20\). The hatched area shows what would be expected from a Standard Model only scenario. A cut at 0.6 is made on the likelihood and at 65 GeV on the transverse mass.

method has been implemented. The variables used (listed in Table 2) have been selected to reflect the two characteristics which distinguish the signal from the background: the heavier mass of the \(H^{+}\) compared to the \(W\), with its effects on the kinematics of the event; and the difference in \(\tau\) polarization depending on the parent. This difference, exploited in variable I, will cause the leading track within the \(\tau\) jet to be harder [10]. Also selected combinations of variables have been included, as correlations are not included in the definition of the likelihood used. Likelihood discriminants are constructed for the five different studied \(H^{+}\) mass points (90, 110,120,130 and 150 GeV). Figure 1a shows the resulting likelihood distribution for an \(H^{+}\) mass of 130 GeV and the background.

A cut is applied on the obtained likelihood, requiring a value higher than 0.6 for an event to be retained (0.8 for a charged Higgs boson mass \(m_{H^{+}}=150\) GeV, due to the better signal-background separation). The transverse mass of the \(H^{+}\) is then calculated for the retained events (shown in Fig. 1b). A final cut is then applied to this reconstructed transverse mass of the \(H^{+}\) candidate (at 50 GeV for \(m_{H^{+}}=90\) GeV, at 60 GeV for \(m_{H^{+}}=110\) and 120 GeV, at 65 GeV for \(m_{H^{+}}=130\) GeV and at 75 GeV for \(m_{H^{+}}=150\) GeV). These cut values have been selected to optimize the significance considering both systematic and statistical uncertainties.

#### 3.1.3 Results

Table 3 shows the selection cut flow for the five different signal mass points and all backgrounds studied in this note. The expected cross-section after the trigger and after the first and second set of cuts is presented, as well as the relative efficiency of each step.

It is difficult to draw conclusions about the suppression of the QCD background, due to its very high cross-section at the LHC. This leads to large statistical uncertainties since no simulated event survives the entire analysis chain. In fact already the expected cross-section after Cuts I (see Table 3) is governed by large statistical uncertainties. A very conservative upper limit for the expected number of QCD events can be obtained by assuming that the expected efficiency of QCD events is limited from above by the efficiency of the hadronic \(t\bar{t}\) events for all cuts for which the number of simulated QCD events is not sufficient to draw definitive conclusions3. This assumption is very conservative since the second set of cuts have been specifically designed to identify the \(t\bar{t}\) topology in order to reject QCD. Nevertheless, using this assumption, the cross-section of surviving QCD events is limited by 55 fb after the likelihood cut (for \(m_{H^{+}}=130\) GeV), while after the cut on the transverse mass this estimate is down to 50 fb. Given the conservative nature of this estimate, the assumption that the background from QCD events is negligible compared to the one from \(t\bar{t}\) events is justified.

Footnote 3: After Cuts II, even more conservatively, this limit is taken from the efficiency for the \(t\bar{t}\geq 1\)\(e/\mu/\tau\) events, due to the limited number of surviving hadronic \(t\bar{t}\) events at this point.

Table 4 shows the final expected cross-section following the cut on the likelihood discriminant and the further cut on the transverse mass of the \(H^{+}\) candidate. The shape of the likelihood discriminant

depends on the mass point for which the analysis is performed, i.e. one will need to run a separate analysis using a different likelihood discriminant for each mass point. Therefore the background rejection will naturally depend on the mass point for which it is evaluated.

The shape-based Profile Likelihood method (see Section 6) is applied on the entire transverse mass histogram for each masspoint, in order to extract the significance of the signal hypothesis. Fig. 2 shows the discovery contour in the (\(\tan\beta\), \(m_{H^{+}}\)) plane for an integrated luminosity of \({\cal L}=10\) fb\({}^{-1}\) as well as the exclusion reach for \({\cal L}=1\) fb\({}^{-1}\).

### \(t\overline{t}\to bH^{+}bW\to b\tau(lep)\nu bqq\)

The events of the leptonic \(\tau\) channel are characterized by a single isolated lepton, and large missing energy due to three neutrinos in the final state. A full reconstruction of the event is therefore impossible. Instead, kinematic properties of the event are used to discriminate between the signal and the main background, which is the Standard Model semi-leptonic \(t\overline{t}\) process.

The branching ratio to \(\tau\) leptons of a light charged Higgs boson is expected to be almost 100%, while the Standard Model \(W\) decay is universal with respect to lepton flavor. This means that the most prominent signature of the signal is an excess of kinematically \(\tau\)-like events.

Furthermore, it is possible to construct a quantity that is bound by the charged Higgs boson mass (in analogy to the transverse mass in a \(W\) decay). This 'charged Higgs boson transverse mass' can be used to provide further discrimination power against the background, as well as a direct indication for the charged Higgs boson mass.

#### 3.2.1 Preselection

TriggerThe trigger requirement is based on either an isolated lepton or missing transverse energy (xE). Events are required to pass one of the following three trigger signatures (see Section 2): e22i_xE30, mu20_xE30, or xE80.

OfflineEvents that have passed the trigger are selected based on the following cuts:

* Exactly one isolated lepton with \(p_{T}>5\) GeV. If the event has not been triggered by the xe80 signature then the requirement is raised to 20 GeV or 25 GeV (for the e25i+xe30 and mu20i+xe30 requirement, respectively).
* Missing transverse energy \(E_{T}^{miss}>120\) GeV
* At least 4 jets with \(p_{T}>40\) GeV and \(|\eta|<2.5\)
* Exactly two out of the four leading jets are tagged as \(b\) jets

Events surviving these selection cuts are expected to be dominantly \(t\bar{t}\) events.

#### 3.2.2 Method for final state reconstruction

First, the hadronic \(W\) is reconstructed from the light (non \(b\)-tagged) jets. All possible pairs of light jets are considered and the one which gives an invariant mass closest to \(m_{W}\) is selected.

The assignment of the two \(b\) jets to the hadronic & leptonic sides is done using the angular correlation between the \(b\) jets and their associated particles, i.e. the lepton and the reconstructed \(W\). The charge correlation between the lepton and its associated \(b\) jet is also used. The charge of the \(b\) jet is defined in the following way:

\[Q_{jet}=\frac{\sum{(p_{L}^{j})^{\alpha}q^{i}}}{\sum{(p_{L}^{j})^{\alpha}}} \tag{1}\]

where the sum is over tracks \(i\) belonging to the jet, \(q^{i}\) is the charge associated to the track, and \(p_{L}^{j}\) is the longitudinal component of the track momentum with respect to the jet direction. The parameter \(\alpha\) is

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{c c|c||c|c|c|c} Channel & Cut & \multicolumn{2}{c|}{Signal} & \multicolumn{2}{c}{\(t\bar{t}\geq 1\)} & \multicolumn{1}{c}{\(e/\mu/\tau\)} \\  & & [fb] & [/] & [fb] & [/] \\ \hline \(H^{+}\) & 90 GeV & LH \(>0.6\) & 56.2 & _0.413_ & 55.8 & _0.182_ \\  & & \(mT>\)50 GeV & 35.3 & _0.628_ & 32.1 & _0.574_ \\ \(H^{+}\) & 110 GeV & LH \(>0.6\) & 53.6 & _0.478_ & 52.7 & _0.172_ \\  & & \(mT>\)60 GeV & 35.1 & _0.655_ & 27.9 & _0.529_ \\ \(H^{+}\) & 120 GeV & LH \(>0.6\) & 42.6 & _0.455_ & 45.5 & _0.148_ \\  & & \(mT>\)60 GeV & 32.5 & _0.764_ & 29.0 & _0.636_ \\ \(H^{+}\) & 130 GeV & LH \(>0.6\) & 38.3 & _0.483_ & 50.7 & _0.165_ \\  & & \(mT>\)65 GeV & 31.4 & _0.819_ & 25.9 & _0.510_ \\ \(H^{+}\) & 150 GeV & LH \(>0.8\) & 14.0 & _0.467_ & 26.9 & _0.088_ \\  & & \(mT>\)75 GeV & 9.3 & _0.662_ & 10.3 & _0.385_ \\ \end{tabular}

Backgrounds not tabulated have been found to be negligible.

optimized to give maximal separation between \(b\) and \(\bar{b}\) jets. The value obtained from optimization with MC data is \(\alpha=0.5\).

A likelihood ratio combining the angular and charge correlations is used. This likelihood ratio is defined between two hypotheses corresponding to the two possibilities of assigning the \(b\) jets. The hypothesis which achieves the higher likelihood ratio score is adopted. This algorithm selects the correct \(b\) jets assignment for about 70% of the events, when no cut is applied to the likelihood score of the selected hypothesis. Higher purity can be achieved at the cost of lower efficiency by placing such a cut, but this is not done for this analysis.

Once the \(b\) jets are assigned, the reconstructed top quark mass \(m_{top}^{rec}\) on the hadronic side of the event can be evaluated, and only those events which satisfy \(100\) GeV \(<m_{top}^{rec}<300\) GeV are retained for further analysis.

#### 3.2.3 Further reduction of \(t\bar{t}\) background

In order to reduce the number of background events in which the lepton comes directly from a \(W\) decay, the decay angle \(\cos\psi\) is used

\[\cos\psi=\frac{2m_{tb}^{2}}{m_{top}^{2}-m_{W}^{2}}-1. \tag{2}\]

In such events, \(\psi\) is the angle between the lepton and top quark directions in the \(W\) rest frame (In the limit that the \(b\) quark is massless). The top quark, due to its large mass, couples mostly to the longitudinal polarization component of the \(W\) boson. As a result the \(\cos\psi\) distribution would have a large (\(\approx 70\%\)) contribution that is symmetric around \(\cos\psi=0\)[11, 12, 13]. However, both the left-handed component of the \(W\) boson and the indirect leptons coming from \(\tau\) decays contribute to the lower \(\cos\psi\) region, and this region is further enhanced by the selection cuts that favor events with large missing energy and therefore leptonic \(\tau\) decays. The signal contribution is similar to that of the indirect leptons, and the less energetic \(b\) jets, due to the higher \(H^{+}\) mass, push \(\cos\psi\) to even lower values. This can be seen in Fig. 3 (a). As a further selection cut, events are required to have \(\cos\psi<-0.8\).

The transverse mass of the \(W\) (in the hypothesis of a leptonic W decay), \(m_{T}^{W}\), calculated using the missing transverse momentum and the lepton transverse momentum, provides further discrimination

Figure 2: \(t\bar{t}\to bH^{+}bW\to b\tau(had)\nu bqq\): Discovery (left) and exclusion contour (right) for Scenario B (\(m_{h}\)-max) [1]. Systematic and statistical uncertainties are included. The systematic uncertainty is assumed to be 10% for the background, and 24% for the signal (see Sections 5.2 and 5.1). The lines indicate a 5\(\sigma\) significance for the discovery and a 95% CL for the exclusion contour.

against the \(t\bar{t}\) background with a direct lepton from a \(W\). The separation is most distinct for low charged Higgs boson masses and is shown for two different \(H^{+}\) masses in Fig. 3 (b).

Charged Higgs Boson Transverse MassA generalized transverse mass for the charged Higgs boson (in the hypothesis of a \(H^{+}\to\tau\nu\) decay) in this channel can be defined. The derivation and properties of this variable are described in Reference [14].

\[(m_{T}^{H^{+}})^{2}=(\sqrt{m_{top}^{2}+(\vec{p}_{T}^{lep}+\vec{p}_{T}^{b}+ \vec{p}_{T}^{miss})^{2}}-p_{T}^{b})^{2}-(\vec{p}_{T}^{miss}+\vec{p}_{T}^{lep})^ {2} \tag{3}\]

This transverse mass satisfies \(m_{H+}<m_{T}^{H^{+}}<m_{top}\). Figure 4 shows the distributions of \(m_{T}^{H^{+}}\) for several charged Higgs boson masses.

#### 3.2.4 Results

The cross-sections of signal and background events surviving selection cuts are shown in Table 5.

Figure 4: \(t\bar{t}\to bH^{+}bW\to b\tau(lep)\nu bqq\): \(m_{T}^{H^{+}}\) distribution, after selection cuts, for \(m_{H^{+}}=90\), 120, and 150 GeV. The dotted line represents the nominal simulated mass.

Figure 3: \(t\bar{t}\to bH^{+}bW\to b\tau(lep)\nu bqq\): (a) \(\cos\psi\) distribution, (b) W transverse mass distribution, for signal and background, after selection cuts, for charged Higgs boson masses of 90 and 150 GeV.

Figure 5 (a) shows the \(m_{T}^{W}\) differential cross-section for \(\tan\beta=20\). Figure 5 (b) shows the corresponding distributions for \(m_{T}^{H^{+}}\).

The statistical significance of the signal is calculated from both the \(W\) transverse mass and the \(H^{+}\) transverse mass distributions, after event reconstruction and all selection cuts. The final significance is taken as the maximum of these two. In Fig. 6, the \(5\sigma\) discovery contour is plotted in the (\(m_{H^{\pm}}\),\(\tan\beta\)) plane.

### \(t\bar{t}\to bH^{+}bW\to b\tau(had)\nu b\ell\nu\)

In this channel a light charged Higgs boson is produced in \(t\bar{t}\) decay. The \(W\) boson from one top quark decays into leptons, while the \(\tau\) lepton originating from the \(H^{+}\) decay results in a jet. At least three neutrinos are present in the event and thus the reconstruction of the complete event is impossible. Due to the high branching ratio of this charged Higgs boson decay (BR(\(H^{+}\rightarrow\tau\nu\) ) \(\approx 100\%\) for low \(m_{H^{+}}\)), the signal can be observed as an excess of tau leptons in the final state over the main background of Standard Model \(t\bar{t}\) production.

Due to the production mechanism, the Standard Model \(t\bar{t}\) events will be the most important background to this channel. However, significant contributions from other backgrounds are still possible, and thus important to study: In the inclusive process \(pp\to W\)+jets, the final state is similar to the signal signature if one of the jets is mis-tagged as a \(\tau\) jet or a lepton and the \(W\) boson decays to the appropriate other object. Furthermore, the backgrounds constituted by single top quark events are considered. Single top quarks can be produced with an associated \(W\) boson or b jet, and thus produce final states similar to the signal. Their contribution to the total background is however expected to be small due to the smaller cross-sections. Finally, the overwhelming background of QCD dijet is expected to be completely suppressed by demanding a high quantity of missing transverse energy and an isolated lepton.

#### 3.3.1 Event Selection

Trigger:Events are required to pass one of the following three trigger items (see Section 2):

e22i_xE30, mu20_xE30, or xE40_3j20_L1_TAU30.

Selection:To select signal events and suppress the Standard Model \(t\bar{t}\) background several small differences between the processes are exploited. The following cuts are applied:

1. N\({}_{e,\mu}\geq 1\): At least one isolated lepton with \(p_{T}>10\) GeV; muons with \(|\eta|<2.7\) and electrons with \(|\eta|<2.5\) are considered.
2. N\({}_{\rm jets}\)=N\({}_{\rm light\ jets}\)+N\({}_{\rm b\ jets}\)+N\({}_{\rm\tau\ jets}\geq 3\): At least three jets with \(p_{T}>20\) GeV.
3. N\({}_{\rm\tau\ jet}\geq 1\): At least one of the jets is required to be \(\tau\)-tagged. A \(\tau\) jet quality cut is applied, leading to a \(\tau\) jet reconstruction efficiency of about 30%.

Figure 5: \(t\bar{t}\to bH^{+}bW\to b\tau(lep)\nu bqq\): Transverse mass differential cross-section for signal and background, for \(\tan\beta=20\), and for the hypothesis of (a) \(W\), and (b) \(H^{+}\).

Figure 6: \(t\bar{t}\to bH^{+}bW\to b\tau(lep)\nu bqq\): Discovery (left) and exclusion contour (right) for Scenario B (\(m_{h}\)-max) [1]. Systematic and statistical uncertainties are included. The systematic uncertainty is assumed to be 10% for the background, and 35% for the signal (see Sections 5.2 and 5.1). The lines indicate a 5\(\sigma\) significance for the discovery and a 95% CL for the exclusion contour.

4. \(\rm{N_{b\,jet}}\geq 1\): At least one \(b\) jet with \(p_{T}>20\) GeV is required, and a \(b\) jet quality cut is applied, leading to a \(b\) jet efficiency of about 60%.
5. \(p_{T}^{\tau}>40\) GeV
6. \(p_{T}^{\epsilon}>25\) GeV or \(p_{T}^{\mu}>20\) GeV: This cut is only applied if the event was triggered by the appropriate lepton signature. If both lepton trigger requirements are met then only the cut on \(p_{T}^{\epsilon}\) is applied.
7. \(q_{\tau}+q_{l}=0\): The \(\tau\) jet and the lepton are required to have opposite charge.
8. \(E_{T}^{miss}>175\) GeV

Figure 7 (a) shows the jet multiplicity of the signal and the \(\rm{main\,\,\,\,}t\bar{t}\) background. While there are more jets for the \(t\bar{t}\) background than the signal a cut on jet multiplicity suppresses other backgrounds. Figure 7 (b) displays the \(\tau\) transverse momentum (\(p_{T}^{\tau}\)). Cut 6 is only applied, if the event was triggered by a lepton signature. For such events, a \(p_{T}\)cut is applied to the reconstructed lepton according to the trigger threshold.

#### 3.3.2 Results

In Table 6 the cross-sections for signal and background after each cut are shown. The first two cuts select events which include a lepton and three jets, assumed to be the two \(b\) jets and a \(\tau\) jet. These cuts are motivated by the final state under study, but do not reduce the most important leptonic \(t\bar{t}\) background. Requiring one jet to be a \(\tau\) jet removes more than 95% of the \(t\bar{t}\) background while at least one quarter of the signal remains, depending on the charged Higgs boson mass. Only one jet is required to be \(b\)-tagged, which is motivated by the fact that \(m_{H^{+}}>m_{W}\) and thus the \(b\) quark produced in \(t\to bH^{+}\) is in average softer (the most probable value for \(p_{T}^{b}\) is about 55 GeV for \(t\to bW\), and between 15 GeV for \(m_{H^{+}}=150\) GeV and 45 GeV for \(m_{H^{+}}=90\) GeV for \(t\to bH^{+}\)). The \(b\)-tagging efficiency decreases quickly for low \(p_{T}^{b}\)[5] and thus the number of reconstructed \(b\) jets decreases with increasing \(m_{H^{+}}\).

Due to the mass difference mentioned above and the \(\tau\) polarizations being different depending on whether the \(\tau\) jet originated from an \(H^{+}\) or \(W\), the \(\tau\)-jet is expected to be harder for the signal than the background, motivating a cut on \(p_{T}^{\tau}\). A harder \(\tau\) jet in turn leads to more missing energy, thus making the \(E_{T}^{miss}\) an attractive variable to cut on. A high value is required for \(E_{T}^{miss}\). This is mainly needed to optimize the significance with respect to the systematic error. Multidimensional optimization attempts have shown that above respective thresholds, the significance is not very sensitive to changes in the values of other continuous selection cuts (such as \(p_{T}^{\tau}\)).

The normalized number of events as a function of the missing transverse energy is shown in Fig. 8. A clear excess is observable for low charged Higgs boson masses, while close to the top quark mass there is only sensitivity for very high values of \(\bar{t}\). Figure 9 shows the final discovery and exclusion contours for the channel under investigation. A significant region of the parameter space above \(\tan\beta=30\) is covered by this decay mode, while the sensitivity for low and intermediate \(\tan\beta\) is limited.

## 4 Heavy Charged Higgs Boson Searches

In this chapter, charged Higgs boson searches in the two heavy \(H^{+}\) (\(m_{H^{+}}\gtrsim m_{t}\)) channels selected for investigation are presented:

* \(gg/gb\to t[b]H^{+}\to bqq[b]\tau(had)\nu\)
* \(gg/gb\to t[b]H^{+}\to t[b]tb\to bW[b]bWb\to b\ell\nu[b]bqqb\)

The notation \([b]\) implies the additional \(b\) given in the production mode \(gg\to tbH^{+}\), which is not produced in the mode \(gb\to tH^{+}\). All plots, tables and results in this section are based on the trigger menu for an instantaneous luminosity of L=10\({}^{33}\)cm\({}^{-2}\)s\({}^{-1}\) presented in Section 2, on the signal cross-sections for the \(m_{h}\)-max MSSM scenario (see Reference [1]) and the background cross-sections given in Reference [8].

### \(gg/gb\to t[b]H^{+}\to bqq[b]\tau(had)\nu\)

The following section describes the event selection for the \(H^{+}\rightarrow\tau\nu\) channel for the case \(m_{H^{+}}\gtrsim m_{t}\). The signal final state is characterised by a hard \(\tau\) jet, large missing transverse momentum (due to the neutrino), one or two \(b\) jets, two light jets, a W boson and a top quark (the mass of which can be reconstructed) and has previously been investigated in Reference [15].

The main background to this signal channel are \(t\bar{t}\) decays, in particular when one of the top quarks decays to a \(\tau\) jet, \(t\to b\tau(had)\nu\), and the other one hadronically, \(t\to bqq\). However, other \(t\bar{t}\) modes can also contribute when some of the objects in the event are not correctly reconstructed, e.g. a light jet as a \(\tau\) jet. Other backgrounds to be considered are single top, W+jets and QCD multi-jet events. A parametrized detector simulation has been used to evaluate the leptonic \((e,\mu,\tau)\)\(t\bar{t}\) background. The

Figure 9: \(t\bar{t}\to bH^{+}bW\to b\tau(had)\nu b\ell\nu\): Discovery (left) and exclusion contour (right) for Scenario B (\(m_{h}\)-max) [1]. Systematic and statistical uncertainties are included. The systematic uncertainty is assumed to be 10% for the background, and 41% for the signal (see Sections 5.2 and 5.1). The lines indicate a 5\(\sigma\) significance for the discovery and a 95% CL for the exclusion contour.

parametrization has been adjusted (using a smaller full detector simulation \(t\bar{t}\) sample) such that the distributions of all the quantities in the events agree with the full detector simulation.

#### 4.1.1 Preselection

Trigger:The trigger selection employs items of the \(H^{+}\) trigger menu (see Section 2). Events are required to pass at least one of the two following trigger item combinations: xE40_3j20_L1_TAU30 or xE50_L1_TAU30.

\(\tau\) jet reconstruction:Only \(\tau\) jet candidates with transverse momenta greater than 15 GeV with a pseudorapidity outside of the crack region \(1.4<\eta<1.6\) are considered, and a high cut on the \(\tau\) quality variable is placed yielding a \(\tau\) reconstruction efficiency of about 20% and leading to a high rejection of parton jets. Exactly one \(\tau\) jet is required in the event, followed by a cut of \(p_{T}^{\tau}>50\) GeV in order to reduce the QCD background at an early stage.

Jet reconstruction:At least three more jets with \(p_{T}>15\) GeV are required, and exactly one of them has to be \(b\)-tagged. For this purpose, a \(b\)-tagging cut is applied to all jets with a \(b\)-tagging efficiency of about 70%.

Missing Transverse Energy:A soft cut of 40 GeV on the transverse missing energy \(E_{T}^{miss}\) is applied to remove most of the QCD background already in the preselection, while it affects the \(t\bar{t}\) background only slightly (about 30% of the \(t\bar{t}\) events with leptons are removed).

W boson and top quark reconstruction:For further discrimination of all backgrounds without hadronically decaying top quarks, an attempt is made to reconstruct a W boson and a top quark. For all combinations of the \(b\) jet with two other jets, the minimum value of

\[\chi^{2}=\frac{(m_{jj}-m_{W})^{2}}{\sigma_{m_{W}}^{2}}+\frac{(m_{b(jj)^{ \prime}}-m_{t})^{2}}{\sigma_{m_{t}}^{2}} \tag{4}\]

is calculated for each event (\(m_{W}\) and \(m_{t}\) are the nominal \(W\)and \(t\) masses, \((jj)^{\prime}\) are the two jets used in the \(W\)reconstruction, rescaled to the \(W\)mass, and \(\sigma_{m_{W}}\) and \(\sigma_{m_{t}}\) represent the resolution of the \(W\)and \(t\) mass reconstruction, 10 GeV and 15 GeV). The resulting \(\chi^{2}\) values are required to be smaller than 3.

Lepton veto:To eliminate events with leptons (in particular leptonic \(t\bar{t}\) modes), events with at least one isolated lepton (\(e\), \(\mu\)) with \(p_{T}^{t}>7\) GeV are rejected.

The preselection aims at suppressing the reducible background such that only \(t\bar{t}\) events involving one hadronic and one semileptonic top quark decay survive. \(W\)+jets events are successfully removed by requiring a \(b\)-tagged jet and a reconstructed top quark in the events, single top events by requiring a hard \(\tau\) jet and high \(E_{T}^{miss}\) together with a reconstructed hadronically decaying top quark, and QCD events by requiring high \(E_{T}^{miss}\) (and additionally by requiring \(b\)- and \(\tau\)-tags and a reconstructed top quark).

#### 4.1.2 Likelihood for further reduction of the \(t\bar{t}\) background

After the preselection cuts, the background is dominated by \(t\bar{t}\) events with one \(W\) decaying hadronically, and the other one to a hadronically decaying \(\tau\) lepton and a neutrino (75% of the remaining background). An uncorrelated likelihood approach has been chosen to reduce this background, employing the following discriminant variables: (i) \(p_{T}^{\tau}\), (ii) \(E_{T}^{\rm miss}\), (iii) \(\Delta\sigma\) (azimuthal angle between the \(\tau\) jet and the missing momentum), (iv) \(H_{\rm T}\) (scalar sum of the \(p_{T}\) of all jets in the event (excluding \(\tau\) jets), and (v) \(p_{T}^{\rm ratio}\) (ratio between the transverse momenta of the \(\tau\) jet and the hardest jet not used for the top quark reconstruction).

The probability density functions (PDFs) have been created for each signal mass point and for the \(t\bar{t}\) sample (with at least one leptonic W decay) using full detector simulation. Slightly less stringent preselection cuts (\(p_{T}^{\tau}>\)40 GeV instead of 50 GeV, at least 1 b jet instead of exactly 1, and a maximum W/top reconstruction \(\chi^{2}\) of 6 instead of 3) and no trigger selection are used to obtain the PDFs in order to keep a sufficiently high number of simulated events. The PDFs for two mass points and the \(t\bar{t}\) background are shown in Fig. 10.

The likelihood distributions for two example mass points are shown in Fig. 11. A cut requiring the likelihood to be higher than 0.9 (\(m_{H^{+}}=400\) and 600 GeV) or 0.95 (other mass cases) is applied and the charged Higgs boson transverse mass of the remaining events is plotted as a final distribution to extract the significance of the \(H^{+}\) signal. These transverse mass distributions are shown in Fig. 12. A clear excess can be observed for lower \(H^{+}\) masses, but the shapes are similar for signal and background. Varying cuts to change the signal-to-background ratio would be a quick way to establish the excess if it was statistically unambiguous, followed by data-driven background estimation methods as described in Section 5.2. For higher \(H^{+}\) masses, sensitivity is only given for higher values of \(\bar{t}\), but the signal and background shapes are clearly distinguishable.

Event selection summary:The following list summarizes the event selection:

* Trigger: Trigger xE40_3j20_L1_TAU30 or xE50_L1_TAU30
* Cut A: exactly one \(\tau\) jet with \(p_{T}^{\tau}>50\) GeV, and \(E_{T}^{miss}>40\) GeV
* Cut B: at least three additional jets
* Cut C: exactly one of the additional jets \(b\)-tagged
* Cut D: veto on a lepton (\(e\), \(\mu\)) with \(p_{T}^{\ell}>7\) GeV

Figure 11: \(gg/gb\to t[b]H^{+}\to bqq[b]\tau(had)\nu\): Likelihood distributions. The areas are normalized to unity. The background likelihood for 170 GeV does not peak at 0 because of the trigger selection (and to a smaller degree the less stringent preselection cuts for the PDF determination) which already removes most of the events in the first bins.

* Cut E: W boson and top quark reconstructed with \(\chi^{2}<3\)
* Cut F: likelihood value greater than 0.95 (0.9 for \(m_{H^{+}}\) 400 and 600 GeV)
* Cut G: \(m_{H^{+}}\) in a certain mass window

#### 4.1.3 Results

The cross-section of signal and background events surviving preselection cuts are shown in Table 7. All backgrounds except for \(t\bar{t}\) with at least one leptonic W decay mode are efficiently suppressed at this stage. The QCD dijet selection efficiency is too small to draw definite conclusions due to its high cross-section, but assuming that dijet events in \(p_{T}\)-bins lower than 140 GeV cannot produce a hard \(\tau\) jet and three jets with the top quark-invariant mass (plus large missing \(E_{\rm T}\) ), that the numbers presented for Cut B are of the right order of magnitude and that the relative efficiencies for the remaining cuts is smaller than for \(t\bar{t}\) events the conclusion can be drawn that the background from dijet events is negligible.

The efficiencies of the remaining Cuts F (likelihood) and G (\(m_{H^{+}}\) ) are shown separately in Table 8; as for these cuts the background efficiencies depend on the \(H^{+}\) mass hypothesis. At this point, all other backgrounds except for \(t\bar{t}\) events with \(W\) decays to \(e\), \(\mu\) or \(\tau\) are negligible.

A signal-to-background ratio of the order of 1 has been achieved, resulting in robustness with respect to systematic uncertainties. The cross-section for very heavy \(H^{+}\to\tau\nu\) production is small but a very good discrimination against the background can be obtained with the likelihood method. The resulting discovery contours are presented in Fig. 13 and show that a sizable region of the MSSM space which has not been explored experimentally before can be covered. Sensitivity is given for large \(\tan\beta\) and \(m_{H^{+}}<500\) GeV.

### \(gg/gb\to t[b]H^{+}\to t[b]tb\to bW[b]bWb\to b\ell\nu[b]bqqb\)

In this section the analysis strategy for the \(H^{+}\to tb\) channel is outlined. This is a particularly challenging signal final state which includes 3 (or 4) \(b\) quarks, 2 light quarks, 1 high \(p_{T}\) lepton and one neutrino. The channel has previously been studied for ATLAS using fast detector simulation [16], and several aspects of the previous analysis have been adopted. However, the use of full simulation for the present study showed the need to add several new cuts to improve the signal to background ratio.

#### 4.2.1 Trigger

Events are required to pass one of the following trigger signatures (see Section 2): e22i_xE30, mu20_xE30, or xE40_3j20_L1_TAU30.

Figure 12: \(gg/gb\to t[b]H^{+}\to bqq[b]\tau(had)\nu\): \(H^{+}\) transverse mass distributions for three signal mass points and the corresponding background fortan \(\beta=35\). The signal events are stacked on top of the background events.

#### 4.2.2 Preselection

Following the trigger, the events are required to pass a set of preselection criteria which define the minimum requirements needed for the event reconstruction:

* exactly 1 isolated lepton (\(e\) or \(\mu\)) with \(p_{T}^{e}>25\) GeV, \(p_{T}^{\mu}>20\) GeV and \(|\eta|<2.5\).
* at least 5 jets with \(p_{T}>20\) GeV and \(|\eta|<5\).
* at least 3 \(b\)-tagged jets with \(|\eta|<2.5\).

Lepton selection:Electron candidates that pass the cuts on transverse momentum and pseudorapidity mentioned above are required to pass further identification and isolation criteria based on the shower shape in the electromagnetic calorimeter and the quality of the track in the inner detector. Concerning isolation, the energy in a cone of \(\Delta R=0.20\) around the electron is required to be less than 20% of the electron transverse energy. The same isolation criteria is also applied to muon candidates.

Jet selection and \(b\)-tagging criteria:Jet multiplicity is one of the main sources of combinatorial background and the \(b\)-tagging efficiency is the major factor reducing the overall efficiency of the preselection. From jets passing the preselection cuts mentioned above, those within the range \(|\eta|<2.5\) are considered \(b\)-tagged if passing a \(b\)-tagging quality cut leading to a \(b\) jet reconstruction efficiency of about 60%. Only events with at least 3 \(b\)-tagged jets are accepted for the rest of the analysis.

The size of the QCD dijet sample is too small to draw accurate conclusions.

#### 4.2.3 Reconstruction

Apart from the objects expected in the event final state, jets from the underlying event are also present leading to an increase of the jet multiplicity.

Reconstruction of the leptonic \(W\):After the preselection is performed, all physics objects necessary for the complete reconstruction of the event are present except for the neutrino coming from the leptonically decaying \(W\). In order to reconstruct the four-momentum of the neutrino, its transverse component is identified with the missing transverse momentum, and the longitudinal component is computed using the \(W\) mass constraint, leading to 0, 1 or 2 real solutions. In about 25% of the cases no real solution can be found. In order to recover those events, the approximation of neglecting the imaginary part of the solution is applied and has been found to have only a small effect on the top quark mass resolution.

The Combinatorial Likelihood:The next step is to associate the reconstructed physics objects with objects of the event, assuming a signal event topology. The number of possible combinations is very large and depends strongly on the number of light jets in the event. In order to overcome this combinatorial background, a likelihood function is defined. The likelihood formalism used in this analysis is based on \(m\) variables and should discriminate between \(n\) classes of events. For each of the \(m\) variables, first the probability density functions \(f_{i}^{j}(x_{i})\) for each of the \(n\) classes are determined: Then the probability for an event to be of class \(j\) when the value \(x_{i}\) is measured for variable \(i\) is given by:

\[p_{i}^{j}(x_{i})=\frac{f_{i}^{j}(x_{i})}{\sum_{k=1}^{n}f_{i}^{k}(x_{i})} \tag{5}\]

The information about all \(m\) variables are combined, ignoring correlations, to define the likelihood \(\mathcal{L}_{j}\) that an event belongs to class \(j\) when measuring the values \(x_{i}\) for variables \(i=1,...,m\):

\[\mathcal{L}_{j}=\frac{\prod_{l=1}^{m}p_{l}^{j}(x_{l})}{\sum_{k=1}^{n}\prod_{l= 1}^{m}p_{l}^{k}(x_{l})} \tag{6}\]

A combinatorial likelihood is used to discriminate between the two classes of events: the correct and the wrong combinations. The likelihood is based on 8 variables:

\begin{table}

The remaining background consists only of \(t\bar{t}\) events with at least one W decay to \(e\), \(\mu\) or \(\tau\) plus \(\nu\).

* \(m_{jj}\): The invariant mass of two light jets.
* \(m_{jjb}\): The invariant mass of two light jets and one \(b\) jet.
* \(m_{\ell\nu b}\): The invariant mass of the lepton, one of the two solutions of the neutrino and one \(b\) jet.
* \(p_{T}(b_{H})\): The transverse momentum of the \(b\) jet associated to the charged Higgs boson decay.
* \(\Delta R(j,j)\): The distance in the azimuthal-pseudorapidity plane (\(\Delta R=\sqrt{\Delta\phi^{2}+\Delta\eta^{2}}\)) between two light jets.
* \(\Delta R(jj,b)\): \(\Delta R\) between the sum of two light jets and one \(b\) jet.
* \(\Delta R(\ell,b)\): \(\Delta R\) between the isolated lepton and one \(b\) jet.
* \(\Delta R(b_{H},t_{H})\): \(\Delta R\) between the \(b\) jet and the top quark associated to the charged Higgs boson decay.

The likelihood is computed for each combination, and the combination with the highest likelihood in the event is chosen. If the maximum likelihood in the event is found to be less than 0.7, the event is rejected.

#### 4.2.4 Final Event Selection

After the event reconstruction is complete the physical backgrounds must be suppressed, of which the largest is \(t\bar{t}+jets\). In order to reduce this background requiring 4 \(b\) jets in the event is found to be crucial. The events passing the 4 \(b\) jets requirements are then passed to a likelihood cut. The likelihood function used is based on 5 variables:

* \(\eta_{b_{H}}\): The pseudorapidity of the \(b\) jet associated to the charged Higgs boson decay.
* \(\sum_{b}w_{b}\): The sum of the \(b\)-tagging weights of the 3 \(b\) jets associated to the top quark and charged Higgs boson decay.
* \(<\mathcal{L}>\): The average combinatorial likelihood in the event.

Figure 13: \(gg/gb\to t[b]H^{+}\to bqq[b]\tau(had)\nu\): Discovery (left) and exclusion contour (right) for Scenario B (\(m_{h}\)-max) [1]. Systematic and statistical uncertainties are included. The systematic uncertainty is assumed to be 10% for the background, and 44% for the signal (see Sections 5.2 and 5.1). The lines indicate a 5\(\sigma\) significance for the discovery and a 95% CL for the exclusion contour.

* \(\Delta R(b_{H},b_{t}b_{t})\): The distance in the \((\phi,\eta)\) plane between the \(b\) jet associated to the charged Higgs boson decay and the system of the two \(b\) jets associated to the top quark decays.
* \(p_{T}^{b_{1}}/p_{T}^{b_{2}}\): The \(p_{T}\) ratio of the two \(b\) jets not associated to the top quark decay, \(b_{1}\) being the one with the lowest \(p_{T}\).

A cut on the output of this likelihood is applied. Its value is optimized to maximize the charged Higgs boson signal significance. This final step improves the significance by only 10 to 15%. The limited number of simulated events at this stage of the analysis, especially for the backgrounds, made it very difficult to optimize the choice of variables to include in the likelihood. Larger background samples will be needed to be able to define a more performant likelihood as it was done in Reference [16] with parametrized detector simulation.

#### 4.2.5 Results

Table 9 shows the selection cut flow after the different steps of the analysis for all simulated signal masses, and for the background for one \(H^{+}\) mass hypothesis. Table 10 presents the results for all simulated \(H^{+}\) hypotheses. In Fig. 14, the reconstructed charged Higgs boson mass for signal and physics background is shown. Since the limited number of simulated events does not allow the construction of a performing final selection likelihood, currently no \(H^{+}\) discovery or exclusion power can be extracted from this channel on its own and thus no contours are shown. It, however, contributes to the combined \(H^{+}\) sensitivity.

## 5 Systematic Uncertainties and Background Extraction From Data

The observation of a charged Higgs boson signal will be subject to statistical and systematic uncertainties. The systematic uncertainties stem from two sources: theoretical and experimental, and both are discussed

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{r|r||r|r|r|r|r} Channel & All events & Trigger & Preselection & Reconstruction & 4 b tags & Selection \\ \hline

in Section 5.1. Section 5.2 addresses how to extract the dominating \(t\bar{t}\) background from real data using a novel technique with so-called control samples.

### Systematic Uncertainties

#### 5.1.1 Theoretical Systematic Uncertainties

Uncertainties in the expected production cross-sections for background and signal processes affect the discovery/exclusion potential of the channels under investigation. For all channels the uncertainty of the \(t\bar{t}\) background is particularly interesting since this is the dominant background. A 12% uncertainty on the NLL calculations is expected4 leading to \(\sigma_{t\bar{t}}=833\pm 100\) pb [17]. Other backgrounds considered

Figure 14: \(gg/gb\to t[b]H^{+}\to t[b]tb\to bW[b]bWb\to b\ell\nu[b]bqqb\): Reconstructed \(H^{+}\) mass. The value of \(\tan\beta\) has been chosen such that the pure statistical significance results in a value of 5.

have similar or smaller uncertainties.

The branching ratios BR(\(t\to H^{+}b\)) and BR(\(H^{+}\rightarrow\tau\nu,cs,tb\)) have been determined with the FeynHiggs package, and similar systematic uncertainties apply [18]:

* \(\Delta\text{BR}(t\to H^{+}b)/\text{BR}<10\%\)
* \(\Delta\text{BR}(H^{+}\rightarrow\tau\nu)/\text{BR}<5\%\)
* \(\Delta\text{BR}(H^{+}\to cs,tb)/\text{BR}<10\%\)

In the high-mass region, the dominant systematic uncertainties on the charged Higgs boson production cross-section stem from the renormalization scale and factorization scale dependence and are calculated to be smaller than 20% in the whole MSSM space. The decrease of the cross-section due to supersymmetry loop corrections has been taken into account by adjusting the cross-sections with an additional factor as proposed in Reference [19], reflecting the altered relation between the bottom quark mass and its Yukawa coupling, \(\Delta m_{b}\). Remaining supersymmetry loop corrections are shown to be negligible.

#### 5.1.2 Experimental Systematic Uncertainties

Several quantities are subject to experimental systematic uncertainties: Tagging and reconstruction efficiencies, energy scales, energy resolutions and the luminosity determination. A detailed list of the systematical uncertainties considered, including their numerical value, is given in Table 11. Each systematic effect has been evaluated individually using the given uncertainty on an event-by-event basis.

The systematic uncertainty of the missing transverse energy is indirectly considered by taking the effects of the other systematic effects in the missing transverse momentum calculation into account. The systematic uncertainty estimates are generally conservative, in particular for the results assuming an integrated luminosity of 30 fb\({}^{-1}\). However, due to the usage of control samples to estimate the \(t\bar{t}\) background, the uncertainty values have a negligible impact on the \(H^{+}\) discovery sensitivity. Furthermore, tests have shown that even for the exclusion sensitivity the effect is very small: Assuming that the total experimental systematic uncertainty on the results could be halved, the change in sensitivity would only be of the order of 0.1 in \(t\bar{t}\)for fixed values of \(m_{H^{+}}\).

The dominant systematic uncertainty for all \(H^{+}\) channels is the jet energy scale, with values between 10% and 30%. Similarly, channels with hadronic \(\tau\) decays are strongly affected by the \(\tau\) jet energy scale. The channel \(H^{+}\to tb\), requiring 4 \(b\)-tags, is strongly affected by uncertainties in \(b\)-tagging efficiency and rejection of light jets. The total experimental systematic uncertainty for the different \(H^{+}\) channels is between about 15% and 40% for the signal, affecting mainly the exclusion sensitivity. Similar values apply for the main background, \(t\bar{t}\), which would remove most of the discovery potential. Thus a technique for a data-driven estimation of the background has been developed, greatly reducing the systematic uncertainty on the background. These "\(t\bar{t}\) control samples" are discussed in the following section.

### Control Samples

The \(t\bar{t}\) process, in particular with one or more \(\tau\) leptons in the final state, is the dominant background to all analyses presented in this note. As the relative contributions from this background in different jet multiplicities are not known, the subtraction of these backgrounds using a data-driven method is necessary.

The method is data-driven in the sense that it uses \(t\bar{t}\to WbWb\rightarrow\mu\nu b\mu\nu b\) and \(t\bar{t}\to WbWb\rightarrow\mu\nu bqqb\) events collected by ATLAS to model the \(t\bar{t}\) backgrounds with one or more taus in the final state. After applying a minimal set of event selection criteria on the data (optimized for both efficiency and purity), one or two leptons from the events are removed and the 4 momenta of the removed objects are scaled into tau leptons with corrections for the mass. The tau leptons are fed into TAUOLA[20] for decay and the decay products are passed to the ATLAS detector simulation and reconstruction software. Finally the result is merged with the original event from which the leptons were removed to constitute a control sample.

The result is a data-driven control sample for each of the final states which potentially constitute a background to one of the analyses, using events from data that can be easily and efficiently triggered. With this method both the shape and the normalization of these backgrounds for all decays (i.e., leptonic and hadronic decays, or in the case of analyses requiring two taus the lepton-hadron and hadron-hadron modes) can be modelled.

#### 5.2.1 Obtaining Control Samples from Data

To extract the control samples from data a set of selection criteria is applied. These are designed to optimize the efficiency and purity of the samples.

Dimuonic channelIn order to extract the sample, events with at least two isolated muons with 20 GeV are selected. To reject muons coming from decays, events with a dimuonic invariant mass in the range 70-110 GeV are rejected. A further requirement is that the missing transverse energy in the event is larger than 40 GeV.

\end{table}
Table 11: Effects of systematic uncertainties for all channels under investigation. The numbers are given in terms of percentage changes in cross-section. The channels are: \(1\): \(t\bar{t}\to bH^{+}bW\to b\tau(had)\nu bqq\) (see Section 3.1), \(2\): \(t\bar{t}\to bH^{+}bW\to b\tau(lep)\nu bqq\) (see Section 3.2), \(3\): \(t\bar{t}\to bH^{+}bW\to b\tau(had)\nu b\ell\nu\) (see Section 3.3), \(4\): \(gg/gb\to t[b]H^{+}\to bqq[b]\tau(had)\nu\) (see Section 4.1) and \(5\): \(gg/gb\to t[b]H^{+}\to t[b]tb\to bW[b]bWb\to b\ell\nu[b]qqb\) (see Section 4.2).

Table 12 summarizes the result of the above selection. The efficiency of the signal (dimuonic \(t\bar{t}\) events) to survive this selection is 28% and the sample purity is estimated to be 71%.

\(\mu\)+jet channelThe selection criteria for the \(t\bar{t}\to WbWb\to\mu\nu bqqb\) sample are designed to reject \(b\overline{b}\to 1\mu+X\) events which have a large cross-section. Events are accepted if an isolated muon is found and two jets in the event with transverse momenta above 40 GeV have an invariant mass within 20 GeV of the nominal W mass. Events with high \(p_{T}\) muons in the jets are rejected. A missing transverse energy cut of 40 GeV is applied, as well as a requirements of least two more jets with transverse momenta above 40 GeV. At least one of these jets is required to be a \(b\)-tagged. The overall transverse energy of the event is required to be larger than 250 GeV and events with a high \(p_{T}\) isolated electron are rejected.

The results of the above selection are summarized in Table 13. The selection efficiency for signal events is 8.6% and the signal purity is 74%.

#### 5.2.2 Method Validation

To thoroughly test the \(t\bar{t}\) control sample method, the produced events have to be run through the different analyses and the obtained shapes and normalizations have to be compared to the ones obtained in these analyses. However, a global check can be done by comparing various distributions from the two cases (a) "real" \(t\bar{t}\) events and (b) "scaled" \(t\bar{t}\) control sample events where muons have been replaced by \(\tau\) leptons. This has been done separately for three final states of interest.

Basic preselection cuts on quantities like transverse momenta have been applied, lower than or at most equal to the preselection cuts applied in the analyses which use the quantities plotted in the following. The MC@NLO event weights have not been taken into account in order to increase the available statistics since this has been shown not to bias the comparison.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{l|c|c|c} Process & cross-section [fb] & efficiency & events [fb-1] \\ \hline \(t\bar{t}\) signal & 119040 & \(8.62\cdot 10^{-2}\) & 10263 \\ \hline \(t\bar{t}\) background & 713960 & \(1.80\cdot 10^{-3}\) & 1287 \\ W+Jets & 202400 & \(5.61\cdot 10^{-3}\) & 1134 \\ Z+Jets & 210290 & \(2.84\cdot 10^{-4}\) & 74 \\ \(b\overline{b}(mu20)\) & 13600000 & \(8.40\cdot 10^{-5}\) & 1147 \\ \hline Total background & - & - & 3642 \\ \end{tabular}

Here, for the scaled events, a muon has been replaced by a leptonically decaying \(\tau\). For the modes \(t\bar{t}\to b\tau(had)\nu bqq\) and \(t\bar{t}\to b\tau(had)\nu b\ell\nu\), in the scaled events a muon has been replaced by a hadronically decaying \(\tau\). The \(t\to b\tau(had)\nu\) momentum is shown in Fig. 16, demonstrating the success of this replacement.

The presented plots demonstrate that the dominant background of all \(H^{+}\) studies, \(t\bar{t}\), can be modelled with the \(t\bar{t}\) control sample method. Even without the intended further refinement of the method, in the regions of interest quantities of the \(H^{+}\) analyses can be modelled within a 10% error margin. This is remarkable in particular for complex quantities, i.e. variables extracted from the combination of several objects (like the top quark mass), and gives confidence that the \(t\bar{t}\) control sample method allows to reproduce the relevant correlations in the event. Thus for all results a systematic \(t\bar{t}\) background uncertainty of 10% is assumed (while the signal systematic uncertainty is extracted from Monte Carlo events, see Section 5.1).

## 6 Combined Results

The sensitivities for discovery and exclusion are calculated with the Profile Likelihood method [21, 22, 23], which includes statistical and systematic uncertainties. The results are summarized in combined discovery and exclusion contours for all \(H^{+}\) channels for two MSSM Scenarios A and B [1], and three different integrated luminosities (1, 10, and 30 fb\({}^{-1}\)). Figure 17 shows the result for the MSSM Scenario A. \(5\sigma\) discovery contours and 95% CL exclusion contours are shown. Figure 18 shows the same results for the MSSM Scenario B (\(m_{h}\)-max). Previous studies have shown that the dependence of the \(H^{+}\) discovery sensitivity on the specific choice of the MSSM parameter values is generally very small, with the exception of the Higgsino mixing parameter \(\mu\)[24, 25]. The discovery significance is

calculated for both cases assuming a systematic background uncertainty of 10% following the study of \(t\bar{t}\) control samples (Section 5.2). The signal systematic uncertainties are discussed in Section 5.1. The statistical uncertainties arising from the use of Monte Carlo samples with a finite number of events have been consistently taken into account.

A discovery sensitivity is given for a large part of the \(m_{H^{+}}\) -\(f\)space for both scenarios, but the difficult intermediate \(f\)region, where the \(H^{+}\) cross-section has its minimum, is not covered. However, a charged Higgs boson in this region could be excluded for values up to the top quark mass. Additional integrated luminosity does not give any further \(H^{+}\) sensitivity for a low-mass \(H^{+}\) after a few fb\({}^{-1}\) have been recorded. The reason is the statistical error from the small \(t\bar{t}\) Monte Carlo sample which is equivalent to about 1 fb\({}^{-1}\) at the LHC and makes extrapolation to higher luminosities difficult. Repeating the low-mass \(H^{+}\) studies with larger Monte Carlo samples is thus expected to lead to a significantly larger discovery and exclusion reach, as can be seen in Fig. 19 in which the statistical uncertainty arising from simulation statistics is neglected (i.e. it is assumed that the number of simulated events is much larger than the number of expected real-data events).

Figure 20 shows the discovery and exclusion contour in terms of the branching ratio \(t\to H^{+}b\) as a

function of \(m_{H^{+}}\). With one year of low luminosity data, it will be possible to discover the charged Higgs boson if BR(\(t\to H^{+}b\)) is larger than about 1-3%, and to exclude it even if this branching ratio is well below the percent level. Similar contours for a heavy \(H^{+}\) are presented in Fig. 21; here the y-axis shows the cross-section for the process \(gg/gb\to t[b]H^{+}\to t[b]\tau\nu\). Sensitivity is given for a cross-section of the order of 0.1pb. Both figures are model-independent in the sense that they can be interpreted in the context of any MSSM, other SUSY, or even non-SUSY scenario.

## 7 Conclusions

The ATLAS potential for discovering or excluding the existence of a charged Higgs boson in two different MSSM scenarios has been evaluated for five different final states of the \(H^{+}\) signal. Significant improvements of present day constraints can already be achieved with limited data (less than 1 fb\({}^{-1}\), about one month at low luminosity at the LHC) although it may not qualify as early physics due to its dependency on higher level reconstruction objects.

Below the top quark mass charged Higgs bosons are predominantly produced in top quark decays and the main decay mode is \(H^{+}\rightarrow\tau\nu\). Three different signal final states have been studied and analyzed separately, each of them separately outperforming the present sensitivity from the Tevatron experiments already with 1 fb\({}^{-1}\) of data. The combined performance of the three channels yields a discovery reach for 10 fb\({}^{-1}\) which covers \(\tan\beta\) values down to 20 and up to 4 for all charged Higgs boson masses up to about 150 GeV. For intermediate \(\tan\beta\) region (around \(\tan\beta=7\)), no discovery sensitivity is present, but a charged Higgs boson could be excluded in this region. The current sensitivity is primarily limited by simulation statistical uncertainties, it is thus expected that a larger production of simulated events will greatly improve the situation and give access to the intermediate \(\tan\beta\) region.

Two analyses have been conducted in the search for a heavy charged Higgs boson (\(m_{H^{+}}>m_{t}\)), a region presently uncovered in direct searches. Here, the main production mode is through \(gb\) fusion (\(gb\to tH^{+}\)) and the decay into a top and a \(b\) quark dominates. However, the dominant \(tb\) decay mode suffers from large irreducible backgrounds, and the combinatorial background. Consequently the discovery potential for a heavy charged Higgs boson is dominated by the \(\tau\nu\) decay mode, which despite its significantly smaller branching ratio allows for more efficient background suppression. The discovery reach in the context of the MSSM (\(m_{h}\)-max) strongly depends on the charged Higgs boson mass and reaches from (\(m_{H^{+}}=200\) GeV, \(\tan\beta=28\)) to (\(m_{H^{+}}=350\) GeV, \(\tan\beta=58\)) for an integrated luminosity of 30 fb\({}^{-1}\). Additionally, the model-independent discovery reach for a charged Higgs boson as a function of its production cross-section has been evaluated. A light \(H^{+}\) sensitivity for a BR(\(t\to H^{+}b\)) down to the percent level is given for a discovery, and well below that level for an exclusion. For a heavy \(H^{+}\) decaying to \(\tau\nu\), sensitivity is given for cross-sections of the order of 0.1pb.

The results presented in this note give confidence that the LHC and the ATLAS detector will be able to probe an extended Higgs sector over a sizable region of the MSSM parameter space. For a high SUSY mass scale, the charged Higgs boson could be the first signal of New Physics (and indication for Supersymmetry) discovered.
