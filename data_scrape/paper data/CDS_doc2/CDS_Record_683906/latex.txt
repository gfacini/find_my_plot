Options include a UV light source which would excite both scintillator and fibers, or a blue LED which will excite only the fibers. The latter runs the risk that scintillator problems cannot be identified as is with a source. Thus the comparison of LED and Cs is an important task.

In the present work, consistent with the Barcelona measurements, we find that the Cs data and LED data track well enough for quality control at the 10 % level.

The outline of this paper is as follows: In Section 2 we describe the sub-module stack, profile insertion and fiber routing. In Section 3 the experimental set-up is described for both the Cs and LED tests. In Sections 4.1 and 4.2 the two methods for unfolding the Cs signal data are presented, and in Section 5 the LED data is presented. A comparison of the Cs and LED data is made in Section 6. We state our conclusions in Section 7.

## 2 Sub-module

The Argonne optical test module is made in standard fashion from 32 alternating layers of master and spacer/scintillator. The scintillators used were spare tiles from the Extended Barrel Module0. Of the 11 tile sizes, tile Stacks 4 and 11 contained no scintillator. (Standard notation is used: Stack 1 is at the inner radius of the submodule.) One side of the sub-module is equipped with 12 profile assemblies with the fibers running to 3 PMTs, the other with 13 profiles with their fibers to another 3 separate PMTs. The readout was the standard fashion: tiles 1-3 readout by one pair of PMTs, 4-6 by a second pair, and 8-11 to a third pair. The 6 PMTs were Hamamatsu R580s with resistive bases. The fiber routing is shown in Table 1.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|} \hline \multicolumn{2}{|c|}{Right Side of Module} & \multicolumn{3}{c|}{Left Side of Module} \\ \hline PMT 1 & PMT 2 & PMT 3 & PMT 4 & PMT 5 & PMT 6 \\ \hline Stack 3 & Stack 10 & Stack 7 & Stack 7 & Stack 10 & Stack 3 \\ Stack 2 & Stack 9 & Stack 6 & Stack 6 & Stack 9 & Stack 2 \\ Stack 1 & Stack 8 & Stack 5 & Stack 5 & Stack 8 & Stack 1 \\  & & Stack 4 & Stack 4 & & \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 1: Tile stack routing to PMTs.The standard depth segmentation is followed: Stack 1-3 is the sampling at the inner radius and Stack 8-10 is the sampling at the outer radius. Stacks 4 and 11 contained no scintillator.

An important point is to be made regarding the fiber installation and routing. The profiles were installed with the module in the horizontal position. Profiles and the Teflon "zipper" were supplied by Lisbon. Since the fibers are not rigidly fixed within the profiles, this horizontal orientation allows gravity to help pull the fibers out of the profile pockets, and if one is not careful, the fibers will become wedged between the profile and the steel master plate as the zipper goes by. This was in fact found to be the case in most bad cells of Module 0 after its autopsy in Spring, 1999. In our particular instance, we made no attempt to be careful in the installation, since some number of bad channels were required to assess the sensitivity of our analysis methods.

## 3 Experimental Setup

The optical test module was enclosed in a light-tight box with Polyflow tubing running from the box top to the steel source tubes which run through the tile stacks for the Cs test. The \({}^{13}\)7Cs source travels by a reel attached to a source driver that feeds the source through a tile stack at a constant rate of about 1.43 cm/sec. The source drive is the standard Barnes drive. A Fortran program on a nearby PC tells the source driver when to start feeding, at what point the data acquisition should begin, and at what gain the signals should be read. All PMTs were identically set at 1800 V for the duration of the Cs tests. In each instance, the resulting signals from the PMTs are sent to a CAMAC module that integrated the Cs pulses and converted them to DC level. The DC level was then digitized and readout by a multiplexed ADC having a front-end amplifier whose gain was always set to 1. We took about 14 Cs runs in total.

The blue LED source was an Ultra-Bright LED with a peak wavelength of 470 nm. For the LED scans, the solid metal tubes used for the Cs source were replaced by square copper tubes with slots to allow blue LED light to travel through the tiles to the fibers. It was driven through the tile stacks at a constant rate of 2.25 mm/s by a manual stepping motor. A Fortran program was again used to begin data acquisition, to set the gain, and to record the converted signal after it was processed through CAMAC. The PMTs were identically set to 1400 V, with the ADC gain set to 1. There were 12 LED runs taken, but the overlap of tile stacks having both LED and Cs data restrict us to compare tile Stacks 9, 8, 7, 5, and 3. Fig. 1 shows the raw Cs source scans and Fig. 2 shows the raw LED scans for the data to be analyzed here.

Figure 1: A typical Cs scan through some of the the optical module tile stacks. One can see the bad couplings in many tiles. All PMTs were set to 1 800 volts.

Figure 2: A typical LED scan through some of the the optical module tile stacks. Voltages were identically set to 1400 volts for all PMTs. The lack of sharing is obvious.

## 4 Cs Source Response

### Fit Method

Because the measured signal from each tile includes contributions from its upper and lower neighboring tiles, an unfolding method is necessary to extract the true tile signal from each measured peak. There is a contribution to Stack N from tiles in Stack N+1, but this effect will be ignored in this report. This issue is addressed further, however, in Section 4.2.

A sum of symmetric exponentials over all peaks is used to fit the measured spectrum:

\[M(x)=\sum_{n=1}^{13}T_{n}e^{-\sigma\left|x-x_{n}\right|}\]

where \(M(x)\) is the raw measured distribution and \(T_{n}\) is the true unfolded tile signal for tile n. \(\sigma\) is the width of the tile signal (related to the mean-free-path of Cs photons in Fe) and \(x_{n}\) is the event position of tile n's signal peak. The true response of a given tile is then obtained from the fit parameters. Fig. 3 shows a typical fit result from fitting a measured spectrum with 27 free parameters. The results of this particular fit are shown in Table 2 along with the measured peak values, \(M(x_{peak})\).

Since the amplitude of the tile signals is dependent on the gains of the PMTs, it is difficult to relate one stack to another unless these are known. For purposes here it is not the absolute amplitude of each signal that interests us, but rather the tile stack signal heights relative to one another within the stack. And in order to do a meaningful comparison to the LED data taken at different PMT voltages, the true tile signals and errors were normalized to the highest signal for each stack:

\[T_{n}\rightarrow\frac{T_{n}}{T_{n}^{Max}}\]

where \(T_{n}^{Max}\) is the highest signal in the given stack. The normalized true response is also shown in Table 2. Errors on the normalized responses are the percent errors obtained from the PAW fit results and are about 10% for each tile.

For the 5 tile stacks scanned, there are a total of 125 couplings and the distribution of their normalized responses is shown in Fig. 4.

Figure 3: A typical result of fitting the measured distribution with 13 symmetric exponential functions. The \(\chi^{2}\) for this fit is 7.7 with \(\mathrm{NDF}=35\). \(\sigma\) used in the symmetric exponential for this fit is 0.393. One notes that the exponential fits the tail well. The parameters of this fit are given in Table 2.

Figure 4: The distribution of the normalized reconstructed (fit) responses of the tiles under study. For an ideal module, the distribution would peak near 1.

### Extraction Method

As one might expect, the fitting process is tedious. What was done above in Section 4.1 was to fit an entire tile stack using 27 free parameters. The convergence of the fitting process requires a close estimate of many of these parameters, especially the positions of the peaks. Initializing these is often difficult. Time and effort would both be conserved if the true Cs signals could be extracted from the raw measured signals without having to go through a computer fit.

Because of the symmetry of the tile placement, the measured signal of tile n, \(M_{n}\), is equal to the true signal of tile n, \(T_{n}\), plus some percentage of the first, second, and possibly third neighbors:

\[M_{n}=T_{n}\,+\alpha(T_{n\,+1}\,+T_{n\,-1})+\beta(T_{n\,+2}\,+T_{n\,-2})+\gamma (T_{n\,+3}\,+T_{n\,-3})\]

To solve for the true response of any given tile, we need to simply solve the matrix equation

\[M\,=AT\]

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|} \hline Measured Peak & True Response & Normalized True Response \\ \hline
88 & 77.5 \(\pm\) 9.0 & 0.481 \(\pm\) 0.056 \\
132 & 104.8 \(\pm\) 11.5 & 0.633 \(\pm\) 0.069 \\

\[M=AT\]

After the \(T_{n}\) values were computed, they were normalized to the largest signal per tile stack. The results for all the runs are shown in Fig. 7, where the extracted values are compared to to the fit values.

A correction to the results presented above comes from a small signal contribution from the neighbor stack closest to the source. If the neighboring stack has fibers to the same set of PMTs, \(\sim 25\%\) of the meas

neighboring stack. If T is the true response from the stack with the source, and U is the true response of the tiles adjacent to T, then a more correct version of our matrix tile signal equation is now:

\[M_{T} = A^{\prime}T+BU\] \[= A^{\prime}T+B(A^{\prime-1}M_{U}-BA^{\prime-1}BV)\] \[\simeq A^{\prime}T+BA^{\prime-1}M_{U}\] \[\simeq AT+BA^{-1}M_{U}\]

where \(M_{T}\) is the (n x 1) vector of measured signals from Stack T; A is the (n x n) matrix of contributions from the upper and lower neighboring tiles of Stack T; \(T_{n}\) is the (n x 1) vector of true tile signals from Stack T; B is the percentage of contribution from the neighboring Stack U; and \(M_{U}\) is the (n x 1) vector of measured signals from Stack U.

The real \(A^{\prime}\) can be determined by looking at Stack 3 or 7, which have no neighboring stack contribution. The matrix B has diagonal elements of the order 0.25, and the diagonal elements of \(A^{-1}\) are \(\sim 1\). The neighboring stack correction is not included in the present work.

## 5 LED Response

Cs as it travels through a stack allows photons to travel through several scintillator tiles at once. Ideally, a source could be used for calibration that would only excite one tile at once, such as a blue LED.

The blue LED simulates the blue light caused by the scintillator, and sends it directly to the WLS fibers along the sides of the scintillator tile in the gap. The response is very clean with no leakage to neighboring gaps. This eliminates the need for any computer unfolding as the signal amplitudes can be read as the local maxima at set intervals within the data.

A poor correlation between the Cs and LED data is possible because, while the Cs interacts with the scintillator, the light from the LED passes through directly to the fibers. A comparison between the LED and the Cs data is necessary to disprove a bad correlation.

The LED is driven through the sub-module by a stepping motor that enables the source to travel through the tile stacks at a constant rate just as in the Cs case. The blue LED for these tests simply shines towards the front of the module. The LED data are narrow distinct peaks whose amplitudes can be gotten directly from the data by looking for local maxima. No unfolding process is needed. Becauseof the consistent reproducibility of the signals, the error in the LED amplitudes is taken to be zero. The LED signals were normalized to the highest peak for each tile stack tested. The distributions for all the couplings are shown in Fig. 8.

## 6 Comparison of Cs and LED Data

As stated before, the amplitude of the tile signals is dependent on the voltage of the PMTs. It is not the amplitude of each signal that interests us, but rather the tile stack signal heights relative to one another. In order to do a meaningful comparison of Cs versus the LED data taken at a different PMT voltage, the true tile signals and errors were normalized to the highest signal for each stack.

Figure 8: The distribution of the normalized LED peak responses of the tiles under study.

The computer fitted data had errors given for each fit parameter. This error was converted to a percent error, and then applied to the normalized Cs fit data. Because the Cs data was normalized with respect to the highest amplitude of a given stack, the normalized data also contains a systematic error. This error is from the inherent error of the fitted amplitude parameter to which the other signals were normalized and is \(\sim\)8%. The LED, because of the reproducibility, had an error taken to be zero. The normalized Cs fit signals for Stacks 9, 8, 7, 5, and 3 were plotted against the LED normalized data for each stack. When the RMS of the difference between the fitted Cs and LED is compared to the mean of each of the data distributions, an average error of 12% is seen. These data are shown in Fig. 9. The line y = x is superimposed.

Conclusions

* The signals from Cs and LED tile stack data agree to 12%
* The LED signal has a reproducibility of close to 0% error
* The raw Cs data is fit best by a symmetric exponential, and has fit error of 8-9%
* The fitted Cs data corresponds to the extracted Cs data to 7% for both normalized and true amplitudes of unfolded signals
* The contributions from the upper and lower neighboring tiles to a measured tile signal without accounting for neighbor stack contribution are: \[<\alpha>=0.22\pm 0.16\] \[<\beta>=0.0035\pm 0.095\] \[<\gamma>=0.0\pm 0.22\]

The 12% errors between the Cs and LED signals may be reduced once the Cs signals are corrected for the adjoining stacks contribution.

At this point the LED could be used to find the maximum signal heights for each tile without involved data analysis. As a safeguard, a comparison for Cs data and LED data for another sub-module will be completed before the decision to phase the Cs out of the quality control procedure is made.
