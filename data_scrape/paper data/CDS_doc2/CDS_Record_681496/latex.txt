###### Abstract

The gas tightness specification for the ATLAS muon spectrometer is conservatively predicated upon it being equal to the rate of contamination from the environment. This report describes measurements of the change in oxygen content of an assembled spectrometer gas manifold at the operating pressure of 3 bar. The measurements have been conducted using a variety of quasi-controlled gas leaks. The observed increase in oxygen is assumed to be primarily due to back diffusion of air into the gas volume through the leak pathways.

Motivation

The gas leak rate specification for the ATLAS muon spectrometer is based upon the conservative assumption that it is equal to the rate of contamination from the environment. The pollution of the drift tube gas is assumed to be dominated by a process of _back diffusion_ of air components over leakage pathways against a 2 bar pressure differential.

The universal experience at all chamber construction sites is that compliance with this specification, while not impossible, requires extensive time and effort. This effort commences with the fabrication of individual drift tubes each of which is certified leak free and continues with gas system assembly onto a completed chamber. It is nonetheless likely that many chambers may never satisfy this criterion and of those initially do, an unknown subset may degrade while they sit idle for 1-2 years until they are ultimately mounted into the ATLAS detector. The question naturally arises, if this leak specification is based on a reasonable assumption. For typical causes of most _low level_ leaks, which might cause a chamber to bleed at rate a few times higher than the specification, what is a realistic rate of back diffusion of contaminants (i.e., major air components: \(N_{2}\),\(O_{2}\), water vapor) into the gas system? The specific objective of this work is to measure this back diffusion rate for an ATLAS gas manifold assembly at normal operating pressures.

This leak rate for a single gas system component of volume V is set at \(\frac{\mathrm{d}(\mathrm{VP})}{\mathrm{dt}}=10^{-8}\mathrm{bar}\) l sec\({}^{-1}\). A \(\sim 2\) l muon drift tube subject to an influx of air at this rate accumulates contaminants over a period of 1 day on the order of a 100 ppm. Cycling of the gas at 1 volume (a few bar liters) per day will lower this concentration of foreign gases. It is established through GARFIELD simulations that gas contamination at the 100 ppm level affects the drift properties of the gas on the order of 10 microns, safely below the design single tube average resolution of 80 microns. Experimental work [2] has demonstrated that an important impact on drift time and resolution due to air contamination is observed only above the 1000 ppm level.

The investigation presented here was motivated by a study conducted on a barrel chamber [3] leaking at 14 times the ATLAS specification.

Method

We have endeavored to measure and quantify realistic rates of back diffusion of air into a pressurized, fully assembled gas manifold. The use of the term gas manifold specifically refers to an end cap chamber gas bar which has been implemented with a full set of tubelettes and all associated O-rings and half-jumpers. For assembly and testing purposes this manifold is mounted on an assembly jig on which half-jumpers are terminated in tube end-plug blanks. The manifold volume is approximately 700 cc.

The physical observable for this study is molecular oxygen (\(O_{2}\)) which is measured by means of a galvanic cell [5] type sensor. This sensor produces a voltage proportional to the partial pressure of oxygen permeating a Teflon membrane in the cell. The manufacturer's claimed absolute resolution is 100 parts per million (ppm) for any single measurement. In this work differential measurements conducted over several hours (i.e., multiple data points) produce uncertainties of the relative oxygen levels of several ppm. The \(O_{2}\) measured concentrations are at the parts per thousand (ppt) level and the statistical error around 5%.

How does oxygen concentration relate to expected \(O_{2}\) levels in a chamber (multilayer)? The gas manifold represents the entry/exit ports for a multilayer, and back diffusion into our test manifold necessarily ends up in the multilayer. Therefore the expected \(O_{2}\) concentration in a chamber multilayer is obtained by scaling the gas bar volume (\(\sim 700cc\)) to the multilayer volume. For chambers built at the University of Michigan, this scale factor is \(\sim 0.0016\) or smaller. Therefore a part per _thousand_ concentration in the gas manifold scales down to \(\sim 1.6\) parts per _million_ in a multilayer.

### Experimental Setup

A schematic of the measurement apparatus is shown in Figure 1. Pictured are the pure Argon supply, valves, pressure gages, the sensor and bubblers. The overall leak rates from the gas bar are obtained from \(dP/dt\) as determined by the pressure gages over a day or two. The smallest localized leaks are detected by a Helium mass spectrometer, sensitive down to the ambient level of \(\sim 10^{-7}\) std cc/sec. Larger leaks are identified with a thermal-conductivity measuring tool [6]. The reference tank, as well as all gas lines are flushed and filled with Argon. The \(O_{2}\) sensor is enclosed in an oxygen free envelope in order to minimize variations in the in the pedestal readings. The zero oxygen pedestal reading is limited by diffusion through the sensor's plastic capsule.

### Oxygen Sensor Calibration

The voltage output of the sensor is calibrated from a single bottle of compressed air where the oxygen concentration is \(21\pm 2\%\). The same bottle is always used for this calibration to provide a stable reference. The full scale output, corresponding to 21% concentration is 4.5 V. Readout precision with a 12 bit ADC is 1 mV and \(\sim 21.4\) mV is equal to 1 ppt.

### Measurement Protocol

A measurement of \(O_{2}\) concentration is made using the following sequence of steps.

1. Pure Argon is flushed through the gas bar and all associated plumbing for \(\sim 2\) hours. This interval is sufficient to allow residual oxygen to be minimized and remain at this minimum indefinitely. This sets the initial oxygen concentration essentially to zero and sets an initial pedestal value.
2. Valves C,D,E are closed and the manifold is pressurized to 3 atm.
3. Valve A is closed, isolating the manifold. Initial pressure readings are taken.
4. An extended interval, of \(\sim 40-60\) hours, elapses.
5. Argon is introduced into the sensor flush port and also into the surrounding envelope.
6. The data acquisition is started.
7. Valve D is opened, and the needle valve E is adjusted to set a 100-400 cc/min flow rate.
8. The sensor pathway is flushed for about 2 hours. This step is necessary to re-establish a zero baseline (pedestal reading) because some oxygen may diffuse into the small sensor volume during the previous 2 days.
9. With the Argon flush now halted, slowly bleed off the gas in the manifold via the sensor. Valve D is closed and valve C is opened. Over the next hour so, the oxygen concentration of the manifold gas is measured.

### Gas Bar Configurations

Four gas manifold configurations were investigated. In the first (I) there is a very small, solitary leak on a half-jumper O-ring with a rate of \(\sim 10^{-6}\) std cc/sec. This leak has not been attributed to any specific cause, but is likely the result of a flock of debris disturbing the seal. With this minor leak the gas bar still meets the ATLAS specification. The second set (II) includes the leak in (I) and an intentionally induced leak at \(\sim 10^{-3}\) std cc/sec. This was createdby a few cotton fibers across the rope of 1 cm half-jumper to end plug O-ring. Fibers (Figure 2), of this kind are spawned by worker's garments. They have a diameter of \(\sim 10\) microns and represent a fairly common leak source. The third measurement (III) is considered _baseline_ in which no leaks are identified and the overall leak tightness is below ATLAS specification. Within the resolution of a pressure drop measurement (dp/dt) (\(\sim 2\)_mbar_) there is no quantitative difference between runs III and I. The final measurement (IV) was conducted for a very large leak- measured at \(\sim 10^{-2}\) std cc/sec using a sniffer [6], and equal to about 700 ATLAS leaks according dp/dt measurement. This leak was produced by slashing the half-jumper to end-plug, 1 cm OD O-ring with a surgical knife. Measurements for I and II were conducted twice to test for reproducibility.

### A note about leak rates

The term "leak rate" is employed here in two senses. When referring to a gas manifold leak rate (or tube or multilayer) the term generally implies a measured, absolute quantity determined from a pressure drop measurement. On the other hand, the rate of some specific, localized leak is determined by a sniffer instrument- either a mass spectrometer, or a gas thermal-conductivity sensitive probe [6]. The leak rates provided by these devices provide a relative calibration but cannot easily be parlayed into a net pressure drop of the test volume. For our purposes this sniffer rate is used only as a means of leak classification.

## 3 Results

The \(O_{2}\) concentration is obtained from the difference of the mean sensor voltages during the 'gas bar bleed' and'sensor flush' phases. In the later, the \(O_{2}\) sensor is thoroughly flushed with Argon which in turn determines the pedestal, or the minimal voltage corresponding to zero (or nearly zero) oxygen content. While this value slowly fell over the few weeks of measurements it remained stable (Figure 3) over any two-three hour interval of sensor read out.

During the final two runs (about one week) the sensor was enveloped in an oxygen free pouch. This reduced permeation of atmospheric oxygen and is presumed to be the reason why the pedestal level dropped.

### Configuration I

In this gas manifold configuration there exists a single leak whose maximum _sniffer_ rate is \(\sim 10^{-6}\) std cc/sec. The net manifold leak rate was less than a standard ATLAS leak, and not resolvable from the no-leak configuration (III). After the gas volume was completely flushed with Argon, pressurized and isolated (as described earlier), it sat for 43 hours and 67 hours in the first and second runs respectively. The results from these runs are compatible as seen in Table 1. The first run (Figure 4) shows that the \(O_{2}\) concentration increased by \(187\pm 4\) ppm/day the second gives \(185\pm 3\) ppm/day. The contribution to oxygen contamination rate of an entire multilayer volume (eg., of an EMS5 end cap) is obtained by scaling the relative volumes. This rate is \(0.29\pm.02\) ppm/day.

### Configuration II

This configuration features a leak rate of \(10^{-3}\) std cc/sec. The measurement was performed twice, albeit with different physical leaks, but at approximately the same _sniffer_ rate. Additionally, both leaks were created using the same type of fine cotton fibers. After the Argon flush, the manifolds were pressurized, isolated and left undisturbed over a weekend- about 66 hours. In the first measurement, (Figure 5), \(O_{2}\) concentration increases by \(255\pm 3\) ppm/day and in the second, \(225\pm 8\) ppm/day. Using the larger measurement, the contamination rate of entire multilayer volume (eg., of an EMS5 end cap) is \(0.4\pm.02\) ppm/day.

mediately following the oxygen measurement. This establishes that gas bar volume can be rapidly returned to the oxygen free state, and that the initial state (which was obtained after a much longer purge) was also oxygen free. Therefore the increase in oxygen concentrations reported here are real and not an artifact of incomplete flush.

### Configuration III

In this setup there are no leaks detectable with a He mass spectrometer above \(2-3\times 10^{7}\) std cc sec; the gas bar leak rate here is probably determined by

the permeability of its 576 O-ring seals. As can bee seen in Figure 6 the back diffusion \(199\pm 8\) ppm/day is consistent with configuration I in which only a single, minute \(10^{-6}\) std cc/sec was present.

### Configuration IV

A final high rate gas bar leak was configured to evaluate a more extreme situation. Here the \(>10^{-2}\) std cc/sec caused the the pressure to drop from 3

to 2.3 bar in just 22 hours. For this reason the duration of this test remained limited. The results shown in Figure 7 are interesting: At a rate \(264\pm 14\) ppm/day there is more \(O_{2}\) diffusing into the gas bar than for any other setup. However it not significantly more than in configuration II, and in any case much less than what the order of magnitude higher leak rate naively suggests.

## 4 Summary & Conclusion

The objective of this study has been to determine the extent of back diffusion of air contaminants into the MDT gas system given some characteristic leak pathologies. These leaks are commonly produced during the assembly of a gas system which uses thousands of O-rigs seals. They result from (but are not limited to) fibrous material on the O-ring and physical defects such as lacerations. In this work such defects have been intentionally introduced. These localized leaks in this \(\sim 700\) cc volume ranges from \(<10^{-7}\) std cc/sec (unmeasurable) to \(10^{-2}\) std cc/sec. Finally, the rate of back diffusion is inferred from the change

in oxygen levels in a pressured gas bar which has been thoroughly flushed with Argon (and presumably initially oxygen free) over time intervals from 1 to 3 days.

For the series of six measurements reported here, the rates of oxygen increase in are remarkably consistent. These increases observed in all measurements may be due to multiple sources: 1) out-gassing from the aluminum surface of the gas bar or the brass surfaces of the tubelettes; 2) from permeation through rubber O-rings; or 3) from residual oxygen from an improperly flushed volume. In general the total out-gassing rates for metals can vary widely- depending upon cleanliness and processing. For 6061-T6 Al [4] the out-gas rate (after 10 hour in vacuum) is \(\sim 10^{-9}\) bar cc cm\({}^{-2}\). Application of this value to a gas bar with \(\sim 2000\)cm\({}^{2}\) internal surface area, yields an out-gassing rate of \(\sim 2\times 10^{-6}\) cc/sec. Assuming the oxygen fraction to be 20% (as in air) the net oxygen increase would be about 10 ppm/day, much less than observed.

Regardless of the precise combination of physical reasons for oxygen level increases, the essential point is that they are quite small. The observations therefore imply an upper limit to the extent of gas contamination due to air back diffusing through system leaks.

We have found that gas bars leaking at a rate higher than the ATLAS specification acquire significantly more oxygen than those below the specification. However the average maximum rate measured (\(1/2\times 251+263\) ppm/day when scaled to the volume of a typical chamber (eg, EMS5, 442 l) is less than 1/2 ppm/day. This scaling is valid if there are no further contributions to oxygen

Table 1: Results of all measurements of oxygen present in a closed gas bar (700 cc) after the specified time interval. The measurements at \(10^{-3}\) std cc/sec correspond to two different leaks; the repeat measurements for \(10^{-6}\) std cc/sec are done with the same leak. The test duration is the elapsed time between the gas bar Argon flush and measurement of oxygen content. The equivalent multilayer rate is obtained by scaling to the multilayer volume of an EMS5 chamber, assuming no further contributions to oxygen intake.

intake, such as diffusion through the Noryl of the end-plug. This is 240 times lower than the contamination rate allowed by the TDR. If the baseline rates for the non-leaking (or minimally leaking) gas bar is subtracted, the contamination rate (for oxygen) is about 0.1 ppm/day. Gas cycling in the MDT system at a 1 volume/day will reduce this rate even further. In light of these measurements and those done previously [3] the ATLAS MDT leak specification, to the extent that it is designed to limit the concentration of gas pollutants, can be relaxed- by a factor of 10 without any impact on the integrity of the operating gas mixture.
