## 1 Introduction

This note presents the results of the vertex reconstruction in the ATLAS Inner Detector for the first two weeks of \(\sqrt{s}=13\) TeV data in Run-2 of the LHC. Some basic vertex reconstruction performance quantities are shown, including the vertex position, the number of tracks per vertex and the \(\sqrt{\Sigma p_{\rm T}^{2}}\) of the tracks in the vertex fit. Events are selected for these studies by requiring at least one vertex in the event to be reconstructed using at least two good quality tracks. These quantities are shown for the leading vertex for the data collected with a low number of \(pp\) interactions and for all vertices for data collected with a higher number of \(pp\) interactions. All distributions are compared to Monte Carlo simulation.

In addition to these quantities, we present some more detailed performance measurements. The measurement of the vertex reconstruction efficiency is presented as a function of the number of reconstructed tracks. The vertex resolution is estimated using a data-driven method and the results are shown compared to Monte Carlo simulation.

Similar studies were carried out in very early Run-1 \(\sqrt{s}=7\) TeV data [1] and in \(\sqrt{s}=8\) TeV data [2].

## 2 ATLAS detector

The ATLAS detector [3] is a multi-purpose particle physics detector with a forward-backward symmetric cylindrical geometry and nearly \(4\pi\) coverage in solid angle. The inner tracking detector (ID) consists of a silicon pixel detector, a silicon micro-strip detector and a transition radiation tracker. The ID is surrounded by a superconducting solenoid providing a 2T axial magnetic field. The overall layout of the ATLAS ID is shown in Figure 1.

During long shut-down 1 (LS1) the ATLAS detector received a major upgrade with the introduction of the insertable B-layer (IBL) [4]. This upgrade introduced an additional pixel layer at a radius of 33.25 mm from the nominal beam line. The IBL layer consists of 14 staves overlapping in the \(r-\phi\) plane, with an instrumented half-length of 332 mm. The IBL forms the innermost layer of the ATLAS silicon pixel detector. The remaining components of the pixel detector consists of an additional three layers of detectorsin the barrel region and a three at each end-cap. The silicon micro-strip semiconductor tracker (SCT) surrounds the pixel detector and has four additional layers of silicon along the barrel, and nine end-cap discs. The silicon detector components cover the rapidity region \(|\eta|~{}<2.5\)

The transition radiation tracker (TRT) consists of gas filled straws and provides position information and particle identification in the rapidity region \(|\eta|~{}<2.0\).

The three sub-detectors cover the radial regions from the nominal interaction point at \(31\to 122.5\), \(299\to 514\), and \(563\to 1066\) mm respectively, with expected resolutions in the \(r-\phi\) plane of 10, 17, and 130 \(\mu\)m.

Outside of the solenoid a high granularity liquid-argon (LAr) sampling electromagnetic calorimeter and a steel/scintillator hadronic tile calorimeter provide coverage in the central rapidity region. The end-cap and forward regions are instrumented with LAr calorimeters for both electromagnetic and hadronic measurements.

The muon spectrometer (MS) surrounds the calorimeters and consists of three large superconducting toroids of eight coils each, a system of tracking chambers, and resistive plate chambers for triggering.

Ahead of the end-cap calorimeters a minimum bias trigger scintillator (MBTS) system consisting of two concentric rings of eight plastic scintillators and embedded wave-length shifting (WLS) optical fibres provide high efficiency triggers for minimum bias events.

For a description of the performance of the ID in the early part of the 2015 run, see [5].

## 3 Data and Monte Carlo Simulation Samples

The data used in this note were recorded during the stable LHC running periods between June 3rd and 13th 2015, when the tracking detectors were in full operational mode and the magnetic field of the solenoid was on. The data are divided into two main periods during which the LHC operating conditions resulted in a different average number of interactions per bunch crossing, \(\mu\). During the low-\(\mu\) period, events were collected based on at least one hit in the minimum bias scintillators, whereas during the high-\(\mu\) period events were selected from a low-rate stream triggered on random bunch crossings.

The number of events analysed in the low-\(\mu\) (high-\(\mu\)) sample is 474551 (290592) from an integrated luminosity of 13.8 nb\({}^{-1}\) (177.4 nb\({}^{-1}\)).

The simulation samples used in this note for comparison with the low-\(\mu\) data were generated with Pythia 8.185 Monte Carlo generator [6] with the ATLAS minimum-bias tune A2 [7; 8], which is based on the MSTW2008LO PDF [9; 10]. Each event in the low-\(\mu\) sample contains a single minimum-bias interaction. The simulated high-mu events contain multiple pp interactions that are also modeled with the A2 minimum-bias tune.

For tracks to be considered in the construction of a vertex they must pass the following track reconstruction cuts:

* \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>400\) MeV
* \(|\eta|<2.5\)
* Number of silicon hits \(\geq\begin{cases}9&\text{if }|\eta|\leq 1.65\\ 11&\text{if }|\eta|>1.65\end{cases}\)
* IBL hits + B-layer hits \(\geq 1\)
* A maximum of 1 shared module (1 shared pixel hit or 2 shared SCT hits)
* Pixel holes = 0
* SCT holes \(\leq 1\)

A vertex requires two tracks passing these selection criteria to be formed as a candidate vertex.

## 4 Basic Vertexing Quantities

Comparison plots for data and Monte Carlo showing the number of tracks associated to reconstructed vertex, and the \(\Sigma p_{\mathrm{T}}^{2}\) of those tracks are shown in Figure 2 for the low-\(\mu\) data and Figure 3 for the high-\(\mu\) data sample. For low-\(\mu\) plots, only the leading vertex of each event, defined as the vertex with the highest \(\Sigma p_{\mathrm{T}}^{2}\) in the event, is used. For high-\(\mu\) plots all vertices are considered. The data are reproduced well by simulation, with some disagreement in the charged track multiplicity and \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) spectra consistent with the results of earlier studies [11].

Track \(\eta\) and \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) distributions are shown in Figures 4 and 5. The track \(\eta\) distribution is reweighted to correct for the difference in \(z\) distributions between simulation and data.

The \(\Delta z\) distribution, the difference along the \(z\)-axis between vertices in the same event, is shown for the high-\(\mu\) sample, and the corresponding Monte Carlo in Figure 6. For a Gaussian beamspot along the \(z\)-axis with standard deviation \(\sigma_{z}\), the \(\Delta z\) distribution is expected to be Gaussian with standard deviation \(\sqrt{2}\sigma_{z}\) with additional features from vertex reconstruction. For small values of \(\Delta z\) nearby \(pp\) interactions may be merged, with both reconstructed as a single primary vertex, leading to a suppression of reconstructed vertices with small separation. This is shown in the region \(|\Delta z|\lesssim 5\)mm. The second effect is that of splitting, where a single \(pp\) interaction is reconstructed as two primary vertices in close proximity. The effects of splitting are shown in the small'spike' around \(\Delta z=0\). These effects are well reproduced in the Monte Carlo simulation with a \(\chi^{2}/\)n.d.f = 1.292.

## 5 Vertex Efficiency

The vertex reconstruction efficiency is determined from data by taking the ratio between events with a reconstructed vertex and events with at least two reconstructed tracks. This is estimated from tracks with the definition given in Section 3. The expected contribution from beam-induced background events is also removed [11]. The measured vertex efficiency is shown in Figure 7. This measurement uses data taken during ATLAS run 267359, a subset of the low-\(\mu\) dataset corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 216.9 \(\mu\)b\({}^{-1}\).

## 6 Vertex Position Resolution Measurement

The vertex position uncertainty is estimated in Monte Carlo simulation and depends on the correct description of sub-detector hit cluster errors, multiple scattering, ionization energy losses due to material in the detector and the residual misalignment. For this reason, the vertex uncertainty in Monte Carlo simulation and data are not necessarily the same. A correction to the fitted vertex uncertainty (\(\sigma_{\mathrm{x,fit}}\)) can be obtained by defining scale factors, \(K_{x}\), \(K_{y}\) and \(K_{z}\), for the errors on the fit vertex positions \(x_{\mathrm{PV}}\), \(y_{\mathrm{PV}}\) and \(z_{\mathrm{PV}}\) respectively, such that the corrected vertex uncertainty (\(\sigma_{\mathrm{x,true}}\)) is given by,

\[\sigma_{\mathrm{x,true}}=K_{x}\sigma_{\mathrm{x,fit}}. \tag{1}\]

The scale factors can be derived in data using the Split-Vertex method [1]. The tracks used in the vertex fit are assumed to originate from a single interaction. This set of tracks can then be split into two groups of

Figure 7: Efficiency of vertex reconstruction as a function of the number of tracks in the low-\(\mu\) data.

approximately the same \(\Sigma p_{\rm T}\) and two independent vertices can be reconstructed. No beam-spot constraint is used during the vertex fit. Hence, the separation between the two daughter vertices gives an estimate for their combined intrinsic resolution. The scale factor is then the standard deviation of a Gaussian fit to the pull distribution given by normalizing this separation to the respective error:

\[\text{Pull}_{x}=\frac{x_{1,PV}-x_{2,PV}}{\sqrt{\sigma_{x_{1},\text{fit}}^{2}+ \sigma_{x_{2},\text{fit}}^{2}}}, \tag{2}\]

where \(x_{1,PV}\) and \(x_{2,PV}\) are the positions of the two daughter vertices and \(\sigma_{x_{1},\text{fit}}\) and \(\sigma_{x_{2},\text{fit}}\) are their respective errors.

Figure 8 show the scale factors in \(x\), \(y\) and \(z\) for data and Monte Carlo simulation as a function of the average number of tracks in the daughter vertices. The data used for these measurements is the same subet of the low-\(\mu\) datset as was used in Section 5.

The scale factors decrease as a function of number of tracks for both data and Monte Carlo simulation, but the scale factors obtained from data are consistently higher than those from simulation.

The experimental resolution of the reconstructed vertex position is obtained by scaling the average vertex uncertainties with the scale factors described above. Figure 9 shows the vertex resolution as a function of the average number of tracks in the daughter vertices.

## 7 Conclusion

The performance of the vertex reconstruction in the ATLAS detector for the first two weeks of \(\sqrt{s}=13\) TeV data has been presented. The quantities are shown for two data-taking periods, one of which had a lower number of pp interactions, and were compared to Monte Carlo simulation. Overall, the simulation describes the data reasonably well. The vertex position resolution was also measured in data and compared to Monte Carlo simulation. Some differences were observed between data and Monte Carlo in the measured scale factors.
