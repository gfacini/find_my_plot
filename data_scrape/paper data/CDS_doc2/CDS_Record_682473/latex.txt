###### Abstract

Pair production of the fourth SM family quarks at LHC and Upgraded FNAL Collider have been investigated. It is shown that LHC will provide clarifying information on the existance of the fourth SM family.

## I Introduction

Recently presented results of discovery of the top quark in Fermilab experiments CDF [1] and D0 [2] were beautiful confirmation of predictions of the Standard Model (SM). But, certain unexplained questions in the SM still remain: the number of families, mass and mass hierarchies for quarks and leptons, flavor mixing, etc. Several attempts to explain all these questions have been made using different extensions of the SM (see, for example [3, 4, 5] and references therein). However, some of the above mentioned questions might have an answer in the SM. For example, the democratic mass matrix (DMM) approach [6] has been developed to solve the problem of masses and mixings of fundamental fermions. Since some difficulties arise in the case of three SM families, the extension of this DMM approach to include a fourth family into the SM was considered by ref. [7], where a parametrization of the mass matrix was proposed and quark and leptonic CKM matrices were calculated. The resultsare in good agreement with experimental data. The predicted masses of the fourth family fermions are close to each other within an accuracy of the order of a few GeV and lie between 300 and 700 GeV.

Experimental searches for heavy fourth family quarks and leptons at \(e^{+}e^{-}\) and \(p\overline{p}\) colliders yield limits \(m_{\ell_{4}},m_{\nu_{4}}\geq 45\) GeV and \(m_{\eta_{4}}>100\) GeV [8]. It seems that the best place to search for the fourth family lepton s will be the future linear \(e^{+}e^{-}\) colliders whereas the fourth family quarks will be copiously produced at future hadron machines [9].

In this paper, we investigate the production of the fourth family quarks at LHC and the Upgraded FNAL Collider. In section II, we present the expected masses and decay modes of \(u_{4}\) and \(d_{4}\) quarks. Section III deals with the production mechanisms for the new quarks and the main background processes. Finally, in section IV, we make some concluding remarks.

## II The fourth SM family quarks

The fourth family fermion masses, in the case of full democracy, are given as \(m_{\eta_{4}}=4\,a\eta\)[7], where \(\eta\simeq 24\,9\) GeV is the vacuum expectation value of the Higgs field, and the first three families of fermions remain massless. If \(a\) is taken as the weak coupling constant \(g_{w}\), then \(m_{\eta_{4}}=8m_{w}\simeq 64\,0\) GeV. For \(a=e=\sqrt{4\pi\alpha_{em}}\) one has \(m_{\eta_{4}}=320\) GeV. After violating democracy, the first three families of fermions acquire masses and the CKM matrix becomes nontrivial. Using the mass values of the observed quarks as input parameters one obtains the fourth family quark masses and the CKM matrix. For the case where \(a=g_{w}\), the predicted masses of the fourth family quarks are \(m_{u_{4}}=638.6\) GeV, \(m_{d_{4}}=639.7\) GeV and the corresponding CKM matrix is

\[O_{CKM}=\left(\begin{array}{cccc}0.9755&-0.2198&0.0021&0.0001\\ 0.2196&0.9749&0.0334&0.0001\\ -0.0094&-0.0321&0.9994&-0.0017\\ -0.0001&-0.0001&0.0017&1.0000\\ \end{array}\right) \tag{1}\]

For the case where \(a=e\) one obtains \(m_{u}=31\,8.6\) GeV, \(m_{d_{4}}=31\,9.7\) GeV and \[O_{CKM}=\left(\begin{array}{cccc}0.9755&\mathbf{-0.2199}&0.0021&0.0001\\ 0.2197&0.9749&0.0334&0.0002\\ \mathbf{-0.0094}&\mathbf{-0.0321}&0.9994&\mathbf{-0.0057}\\ \mathbf{-0.0002}&\mathbf{-0.0003}&0.0057&1.0000\end{array}\right) \tag{2}\]

The dominant decay modes of these new quarks are therefore \(u_{4}\to b+W^{+}\), \(d_{4}\to t+W^{-}\) and the branching ratio for \(u_{4}\) decay is given by

\[Br(u_{4}\to bW^{+})=\frac{|O_{u_{4}\bar{b}}|^{2}}{|O_{u_{4}\bar{b}}|^{2}+|O_{u_ {4}\bar{s}}|^{2}+|O_{u_{4}\bar{s}}|^{2}} \tag{3}\]

Using appropriate values from Eq.1 and Eq.2, one gets 0.993 and 0.998 for the branching ratio, respectively. Due to the large mass of the t quark, for \(Br(d_{4}\to tW^{-})\) we obtain slightly lower values: 0.992 and 0.997, respectively.

The fourth family quarks will be pairly-produced at hadron colliders mainly in the processes:

\[pp(p\overline{p}) \to \bar{u_{4}}u_{4}X\to W^{-}\overline{b}W^{+}b+X, \tag{4}\] \[pp(p\overline{p}) \to \bar{d_{4}}d_{4}X\to W^{-}W^{+}\overline{b}W^{-}W^{+}b+X. \tag{5}\]

The \(b(\overline{b})\) quarks can be identified in the detector as \(b\)-jets (so called b-tagging), the hadronic decay modes of the W-boson will be observed as two jets and its leptonic decay modes will be observed as a lepton \(+\not{p}_{t}\). The expected event topologies for process (4) are therefore

\[\bar{u_{4}}u_{4} \to \left\{\begin{array}{ll}e^{-}e^{+}(e^{-}\mu^{+},\mu^{-}e^{+}, \mu^{-}\mu^{+})+2b+\not{p}_{t}&4.9\%\\ e^{-}(\mu^{-},e^{+},\mu^{+})+2b+2j+\not{p}_{t}&29.6\%\\ 2b+4j&44.4\%\end{array}\right.\]

The six-jet mode is not suitable for detection of the fourth family quarks due to the large QCD backgrounds [10]. Final states containing \(\tau\)-leptons were not considered here.

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:4]

where Q denotes a heavy \(u_{4}\) or \(d_{4}\) quark. The cross sections for the production of a pair of heavy quarks are well known [13]. The simulated integrated cross sections obtained for the processes (4) and (5) as a function of mass \(M_{\mbox{\tiny{q}}}\) at LHC and Upgraded FNAL energies are presented in Fig. 1 and Fig. 2. In the same figures, the contributions of gluon-gluon and quark-antiquark fusion subprocesses are also shown. It can be seen that the main contribution to the production cross-section arises from gg fusion subprocess at the LHC, whereas for the Upgraded FNAL the dominant subprocess is \(q\overline{q}\)-fusion.

The major irreducable backgrounds to the signal process (6) arise from:

a) \(pp(p\overline{p})\to t\overline{t}X\to W^{+}bW^{-}\overline{b}+X\)

the \(t\overline{t}\) pair-production process has significant cross section, but contributes only to the low end of the invariant mass spectrum of \(M_{W+b}\);

b) \(pp(p\overline{p})\to W^{+}bW^{-}\overline{b}+X\)

the inclusive \(W^{+}W^{-}\) pair production process has a small cross section, but is the most important background in the mass region of the new heavy quark.

As an illustration, we present results for the pair production of \(u_{4}\) quarks with masses 640 GeV at LHC. The number of simulated events and the total cross sections for background processes are given in Table 1. Fig. 3 shows transverse momentum distributions for b-quarks and leptons from different backgrounds and signal process. As it can be seen, b-quarks and leptons from decay of the heavy fourth family quarks have higher transverse momentum than those from backgrounds. Hence the kinematic cuts we applied for the study of a heavy \(u_{4}\) quark are

i. \(P_{t}^{\ \dagger},P_{t}^{\ \dagger-j\varepsilon t}>1\,50\) GeV

ii. \(\left|\eta^{\dagger}\right|,\left|\eta^{\dagger-j\varepsilon t}\right|<2.5\).

In Fig. 4 we present the invariant mass distribution of \(M_{W^{+}b}\) for backgrounds and signal process at LHC. From this figure we conclude that heavy quarks will be clearly visible as an apparent signal above background (signal-to-background ratio is about two orders of magnitude).

As can be seen from Fig. 1, LHC with the integral luminosity of \(10^{4}pb^{-1}\) will give opportunity to observe the fourth family quarks up to the masses of 850 GeV if one takes production of \(10^{3}\) pairs per working year as a discovery limit. With the luminosity \(10^{5}pb^{-1}\), this value increases up to 1.5 TeV. Note that partial wave unitarity at high energies restricts the mass values of the fourth family fermions to be less than 1 TeV [14].

According to Fig. 2 Upgraded FNAL with the luminosity of \(10^{4}pb^{-1}\) will produce 100 events per year for \(m_{{}_{\tilde{\eta}_{4}}}\)= 600 GeV.

## IV Summary

We have shown that the fourth SM family quarks with predicted masses in the range of 300-700 GeV will clearly manifest themselves at LHC whereas Upgraded FNAL Collider might be inadequate if the masses are greater than 600 GeV. Therefore LHC will solve the existance problem of the fourth SM family.
