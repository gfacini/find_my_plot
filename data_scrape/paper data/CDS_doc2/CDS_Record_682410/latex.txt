**Abstract**

The possibility to detect signal from the charged Higgs boson decaying into \(H^{\pm}\to t\bar{b}\) in the cascade decay of squarks at the LHC energy is studied. The mass region of charged Higgs boson 160 - 300 GeV is considered. The branching ratio of \(H^{\pm}\) production in this mass region reaches 30% - 40% for some set of the SUSY parameters. Using parametrisation of detector it is shown how it is possible to extract signal of \(H^{\pm}\to t\bar{b}\) from combinatorial and \(t\bar{t}\) background.

Introduction

The wellknown signature of squark and gluino production is a large missing transverse energy (\(E_{T}^{mis}\)) in the events. This signature is created when squarks and gluinos decay directly into the lightest neutralino:

\[\begin{array}{rcl}\tilde{g}&\rightarrow&q+\tilde{q}+\tilde{\chi}_{1}^{0};\\ \tilde{q}&\rightarrow&q+\tilde{\chi}_{1}^{0};\end{array}\]

At the LHC energy a mass region about 1 TeV for squark and gluino is reachable. At the large mass values the branching ratios for the direct decay into the lightest neutralino are small [1] and the cascade decays of squarks and gluino are dominant. In this case squark or gluino decay into a heavier chargino or neutralino:

\[\begin{array}{rcl}\tilde{q}&\rightarrow&q+\tilde{\chi}_{i}^{0};\\ \tilde{q}&\rightarrow&q+\tilde{\chi}_{i}^{\pm};\\ \tilde{g}&\rightarrow&q+\tilde{q}+\tilde{\chi}_{i}^{0};\\ \tilde{g}&\rightarrow&q+\tilde{q}^{\prime}+\tilde{\chi}_{i}^{\pm};\end{array}\]

The charginos and neutralinos in turn decay into the lighter supersymmetrical particles and bosons like \(h^{0}\), \(Z^{0}\), \(W^{\pm}\), \(H^{\pm}\) or A :

\[\begin{array}{rcl}1.&\tilde{\chi}_{i}^{0}&\rightarrow&\tilde{\chi}_{k}^{0}+ h^{0}(Z^{0},A)\\ 2.&\tilde{\chi}_{i}^{0}&\rightarrow&\tilde{\chi}_{k}^{\pm}+H^{\mp}(W^{\mp})\\ 3.&\tilde{\chi}_{i}^{\pm}&\rightarrow&\tilde{\chi}_{k}^{0}+H^{\pm}(W^{\pm})\\ 4.&\tilde{\chi}_{i}^{\pm}&\rightarrow&\tilde{\chi}_{k}^{\pm}+h^{0}(Z^{0},A) \end{array}\]

In this case the SUSY events have the following signature: softened \(E_{T}^{mis}\) distribution, large multiplicity of jets and isotropic topology. As a result of the chargino and neutralino decays the final state in general contains \(h^{0}\), \(Z^{0}\), \(W^{\pm}\), \(H^{\pm}\) or A particles. Thus the detection of SUSY Higgs signal in the final state of SUSY events might be an interesting signature of cascade decay of squarks or gluinos. In our first paper [2] we considered the possibility to extract signal of light Higgs boson \(h^{0}\to b\bar{b}\) in the cascade decays of gluino. Now we study the possibility to detect signal from charged Higgs boson production in the cascade decays of squarks. We analyse mass region \(m_{H^{\pm}}>m_{top}\), where \(m_{top}\) is mass of top quark. In this case the dominant decay channel of charged Higgs is \(H^{\pm}\to t\bar{b}\). In turn \(t\to bW^{\pm}\) (the dominant decay mode) and \(W\to jj\). Thus in the final state we detect signal from \(H^{\pm}\) in the bbjj invariant mass distribution, where invariant mass of two jets \(m_{jj}\) is closed to W boson mass.

The dominant background for this channel is a process:

1. \(pp\to t\bar{t}\to b\bar{b}W^{+}W^{-}\).

But some contribution we expect also from processes:

\[\begin{array}{rcl}2.&QCD&\rightarrow&bbjj;\\ 3.&pp&\rightarrow&ZW\to bbjj;\\ 4.&pp&\rightarrow&ZZ\to bbjj.\end{array}\]After SUSY event cuts which are based on signature of SUSY events and will be discussed further the contribution of these processes doesn't exceed 30% of \(t\bar{t}\) events. Because a CPU time limitation we didn't run full simulation for processes 2 - 4.

For direct production of charged Higgs boson \(pp\to bg\to tH^{\pm}\) it might be very difficult to extract a visible signal in bbjj invariant mass distribution from the large background of \(pp\to t\bar{t}\to b\bar{b}W^{+}W^{-}\) processes. The SUSY scenario gives a good possibility to reduce the \(t\bar{t}\) background sufficiently and to obtain a visible signal from charged Higgs boson. Thus it could be the way to detect \(H^{\pm}\) boson if mass \(m_{H^{\pm}}\) larger then top mass.

## 2 The Detector Model and Simulation.

The simulation of SUSY events was done with the ISASUSY Monte Carlo [3], while for the \(pp\to t\bar{t}\) background PYTHIA 5.6 was used. A generation of nonzero lifetimes for unstable particles and second vertex definition have been implemented in ISASUSY to simulate b-tagging.

For the tracking part of the detector a simplified model made by S.Gadomski (described in detail in [4]) has been used. This model is based on a detector consisting of a Silicon Tracker/Vertex (SITV), an outer tracker and a forward tracker. Magnetic field, multiple scattering and detector response were taken into account to get the resolution for the impact parameter. The impact parameter resolution was obtained as a function of momentum and rapidity of charged particles and is valid for \(|\eta|\leq 2\) and a momentum \(P\geq 1\) GeV/c.

To simulate the calorimeter particle energies are deposited in a grid with energy smearing according to \(\Delta E/E=10\%/\sqrt{E}\oplus 1\%\) for the electromagnetic calorimeter and \(\Delta E/E=50\%/\sqrt{E}\oplus 2\%\) for the hadronic calorimeter. In both cases the granularity of \(\Delta\eta\times\Delta\phi=0.05\times 0.05\) was taken. A fairly standard jet algorithm was then used to find the cell with the highest transverse energy, collect all energy in a cone around the cell and to define the jet energy and the jet axis. The cone size \(R=\sqrt{\Delta\eta^{2}+\Delta\phi^{2}}=0.3\) was chosen.

## 3 The Parameter Space

For the first approximation of the particle spectrum of the MSSM five basic parameters are needed : \(M_{\tilde{g}}\) - the gluino mass; \(M_{\tilde{q}}\) - the squark mass; \(\tan\beta=v_{2}/v_{1}\), where \(v_{1}=\langle H_{1}^{0}\rangle\) and \(v_{2}=\langle H_{2}^{0}\rangle\) are the two vacuum expectation values for two Higgs doublets; \(\mu\) - the Higgsino mixing mass parameter; \(M_{CH}\) - the mass of the charged Higgs boson (or any other Higgs mass).

In this work the following parameter region has been chosen:

\begin{tabular}{l l l}
1. & \(M_{\tilde{q}}\) & = \(750GeV,1000GeV\); \\
2. & \(M_{\tilde{g}}\) & = \(2M_{\tilde{q}}\); \\
3. & \(\tan\beta\) & = \(2,10\); \\
4. & \(\mu\) & = \(-400-400GeV\); \\
5. & \(M_{CH}\) & = \(160-300GeV\). \\ \end{tabular}

For less values of squark mass branching ratios of charged Higgs boson production in this mass region is too small due to phase space limitation for cascade decay of squarks via heavy particles.

## 4 The Branching Ratios

The branching ratios (Br.R.), defined as the fraction of squark pair production events with at least one charged Higgs boson in the final state, are shown on Fig 1 - 4 for the considered parameter space. From these figures one can see that for the squark mass \(M_{\tilde{q}}=1000\) GeV, \(\tan\beta=2\) and some values of \(\mu\) parameter Br.R. reaches 40% for \(M_{CH}=160\) GeV and then decreases up to 20% for \(M_{CH}=300\) GeV. For the masses \(M_{\tilde{q}}=750\) GeV and \(M_{CH}=160\) GeV Br.R. equal to 26% and decreases to 15% at \(M_{CH}=260\) GeV. For \(\tan\beta=10\) the accessible values of Br.R. for charged Higgs boson production are smaller than for \(\tan\beta=2\).

For futher simulations two sets of parameters have been chosen:

\begin{tabular}{l l l l l}
1. & \(M_{\tilde{q}}=750GeV,\) & \(M_{\tilde{g}}=2M_{\tilde{q}},\) & \(\tan\beta=2,\) & \(\mu=100GeV,\) & \(M_{CH}=240GeV\); \\
2. & \(M_{\tilde{q}}=1000GeV,\) & \(M_{\tilde{g}}=2M_{\tilde{q}},\) & \(\tan\beta=2,\) & \(\mu=100GeV,\) & \(M_{CH}=240GeV,280GeV\); \\ \end{tabular}

In both cases the mass of the top quark is assumed to be equal to 140 GeV. For this value of top mass and \(M_{CH}=160\) GeV the mean value of transverse momenta of b-jets produced from charged Higgs boson decay is small (about 30 GeV/c) and the most number of these b-jets cannot be found by standard algorithm of finding the cell clusters in the calorimeter. The fraction of Higgs bosons for which all four jets bbjj have \(P_{T}\geq 20\) GeV/c, as is required by algorithm of jet finding doesn't exceed 25% from all Higgs decaying into bbjj. It means that the real contribution of charged Higgs boson into detected bbjj combinations is much smaller than it was expected from Br.R. That is why we don't present results for simulation of SUSY processes with Higgs mass \(M_{CH}\) equal to 160 GeV and 200 GeV.

## 5 The Combinatorial background

In the cascade decay of squarks a large contribution to \(b(\bar{b})\) production comes from \(Z^{0}\), \(h^{0}\), A and \(H^{0}\) boson decays. A large number of \(W^{\pm}\) produces from neutralino and chargino decays. The contribution of these particles into \(b(\bar{b})\) and W production in % is presented in Table 1 and 2 for \(M_{CH}=240\) GeV and \(M_{sq}=1000\) GeV. One can see that the largestcontribution to \(b(\bar{b})\)-jets (about 30%) comes from light Higgs boson decays and the largest number of W bosons (about 50%) produces from \(\tilde{\chi}^{0}_{3}\) decays. It means that in the cascade decay of squarks the combinatorial background for charged Higgs boson produced in the decay mode \(H^{\pm}\to b\bar{b}jj\) can be fairly significant. Approximately the same contributions of \(h^{0}\) into \(b(\bar{b})\) -jets and \(\tilde{\chi}^{0}_{3}\) into W bosons production we observe for other values of \(M_{CH}\) and \(M_{\bar{q}}\).

To reduce combinatorial background we applied cut for \(jj_{W}\) transverse momenta. The mean values of transverse momenta of W boson produced from \(\tilde{\chi}^{0}_{3}\) and \(\tilde{\chi}^{\pm}_{2}\) decays are 1.5 - 2 times higher then for W boson produced from \(H^{\pm}\) decay because the masses are larger. So we selected in the calorimeter two jets (jj) with invariant mass \(M_{jj}\) closed to W boson mass, \(|\ M_{jj}-M_{W}\ |\leq 10\ {\rm GeV}\), and transverse momentum \(P_{T_{jj}}\leq 200\ {\rm GeV}\).

Another possibility to reduce combinatorial background is to use properties of bbjj combinations produced from \(H^{\pm}\) decay in term for example thrust variable. If charged Higgs boson mass isn't much larger then top mass than in the rest frame of \(H^{\pm}\) a distribution of these four jets have isotropic structure and thrust variable get low values. One can see on Fig.5 the thrust distribution for bbjj combinations produced from charged Higgs boson decay with \(M_{CH}=240\ {\rm GeV}\) and for all bbjj combinations in the cascade decays of squarks. To reduce combinatorial background we selected bbjj combinations with lower values of thrust variable in the rest frame of these four jets. The concrete values of thrust will be pointing further.

The thrust axis reconstrates a direction of t and b quarks in the rest frame of charged Higgs boson. On Fig.6 one can see the angular distributions of \(b_{1}\) and \(b_{2}\) quarks produced in the decay \(H^{\pm}\to tb_{1}\to W^{\pm}b_{2}b_{1}\) with mass \(M_{CH}=240\ {\rm GeV}\) relative to the thrust axis. The direction of \(b_{1}\) quark is closed to the thrust axis if charged Higgs boson mass is sufficiently larger then top mass to provide high momentum of \(b_{1}\) quark in the \(H^{\pm}\) rest frame. To reduce combinatorial background we selected bbjj combinations if the \(b_{1}\)-jet with the largest momentum in the bbjj rest frame had \(|\ \cos\theta\ |\geq 0.7\) and the invariant mass the rest of others jets ( \(b_{2}jj\)) is closed to the top mass: \(|\ M_{b_{2}jj}-M_{top}\ |\leq 50\ {\rm GeV}\).

Four jets produced from charged Higgs boson decay should be rather collimated relative to the momentum direction of Higgs boson because the mean value of \(H^{\pm}\) momenta is sufficiently high (about 250 - 300 \({\rm GeV}/{\rm c}\)). To reduce combinatorial background more we selected bbjj combinations if all four jets fall in the cone with radius \(R_{H}=\sqrt{\Delta\eta_{H}^{2}+\Delta\phi_{H}^{2}}=2.6\). Here \(\Delta\eta_{H}=\eta_{H}-\eta_{i}\) and \(\Delta\phi_{H}=\phi_{H}-\phi_{i}\) denote \(\eta\) and \(\phi\) of each jet relative to Higgs direction. After this cut on quark level about 80% bbjj combinations from charged Higgs boson decay survive.

## 6 B-tagging

The standard b-tagging procedure used is based on the detection of charged particles in a jet with an impact parameter greater than 200 \(\mu m\) and \(P_{T}>2\ {\rm GeV}/{\rm c}\). If the jet has more than \(n_{cut}(\geq 1)\) tracks satisfying these requirements it is tagged as a b-jet.

To make the b-tagging the jets were first reconstructed at particle level. The LUCLUS routine from PYTHIA have been adapted to the ISASUSY Monte Carlo to reconstruct the jets and to define the jet axis. The impact parameter smeared by the resolution function was then calculated for each particle in the jet. If some particle level jet passed the b-tagging criteria the direction of this jet was compared with the direction of jets found by clustering in the calorimeter. The jet found in the calorimeter was then tagged as b-jet if the difference in direction was within the interval \(\Delta\eta,\Delta\phi\leq 0.12\).

## 7 The SUSY event cuts

To reduce \(t\bar{t}\) events background the following SUSY event cuts were used:

1. \(E_{T}^{mis}\geq 120GeV,\)\(N_{jet}(E_{T}\geq 50GeV)\geq 5,\)\(circularity\geq 0.1,\)\(\sum E_{T_{i}}\geq 1000GeV;\)
2. \(E_{T}^{mis}\geq 120GeV,\)\(N_{jet}(E_{T}\geq 50GeV)\geq 5,\)\(circularity\geq 0.1,\)\(\sum E_{T_{i}}\geq 1200GeV.\)

where \(N_{jet}\) is the multiplicity of jets fulfilling the \(E_{T}\) cut, \(circularity\) is the sphericity in the transverse plane, the sum of transverse energy deposited in the cells \(\sum E_{T_{i}}\) is making over all cells within \(\mid\eta\mid\leq 3\). Cut 1 was applied for SUSY events with the squark mass \(M_{\tilde{q}}=750\) GeV and cut 2 when \(M_{\tilde{q}}=1000\) GeV.

In the tables 3 and 4 one can find number of SUSY and \(t\bar{t}\) events for an integrated luminosity \(10^{5}pb^{-1}\) before cuts and after.

## 8 Results

The invariant mass distribution for bbjj combinations in the SUSY events with squark mass equal to 1000 GeV and \(M_{CH}=240\) GeV after cuts \(|M_{jj}-M_{W}|\leq 12\) GeV and \(P_{Tjj}\leq 180\) GeV is shown on Fig.7. One can see that a combinatorial background on this plot is too large and it is not possible to detect signal from \(H^{\pm}\to b\bar{b}jj_{W}\).

On Fig.8a. the same distribution after cuts \(thrust_{bbjj}\leq 0.80\) is presented. In this case combinatorial background is reduced significantly and the charged Higgs boson signal becomes more distinct. Using next cut \(\mid\cos\theta_{b_{1}}\mid\geq 0.7\) and \(\mid M_{b_{2}jj}-M_{top}\mid\leq 50GeV\) it's possible to detect clear signal of \(H^{\pm}\) in bbjj invariant mass distribution (Fig.8b). On these figures the dashed line histograms show bbjj invariant mass distributions for \(t\bar{t}\) events after the same cuts. The total statistic for these plots corresponds to an integrated luminosity \(10^{5}pb^{-1}\). One can see that after all cuts it's possible to extract visible signal of charged Higgs boson from the combinatorial and \(t\bar{t}\) backgrounds.

On Fig.9a bbjj invariant mass distribution for \(M_{\tilde{q}}=750\) GeV and \(M_{CH}=240\) GeV is shown after using cuts: \(thrust_{bbjj}\leq 0.78\) and \(R\leq 2.6\). On Fig.9b the shaded histogram represent the \(t\bar{t}\) background survived after combinatorial and SUSY events cuts. In this case the clear signal from \(H^{\pm}\to b\bar{b}jj\) is observed above the combinatorial and \(t\bar{t}\) backgrounds as well as on Fig.8.

On Fig.10 a,b one can find the same plots for SUSY events with \(M_{\tilde{q}}=1000\) GeV and \(M_{CH}=280\) GeV (solid line histogram) and for \(t\bar{t}\) events (shaded histogram) after cuts \(thrust_{bbjj}\leq 0.85\) and \(R\leq 2.6\). In this case the signal from \(H^{\pm}\) boson merges with the maximum of the invariant mass distribution for the combinatorial and \(t\bar{t}\) backgrounds. That means it's not possible to extract clear signal using these cuts but some estimation of the number of bbjj combinations coming from charged Higgs boson with mass \(M_{CH}=280\) GeV can be obtained.

## 9 Conclusion

Using the described analysis in the cascade decay of squarks it will be possible to observe clear signal from \(H^{\pm}\to b\bar{b}jj_{W}\) with \(H^{\pm}\) mass around 240 GeV above the combinatorial and \(t\bar{t}\) events background for the high level of the integrated luminosity \(10^{5}pb^{-1}\). The statistical level of the SUSY events with squark mass around 750 GeV is sufficient to detect signal at the middle level of the integrated luminosity \(5\ 10^{4}pb^{-1}\).

In this paper we present the results of SUSY events simulations for one set of parameters: \(\tan\beta=2\) and \(\mu=100\) GeV, but the other sets should be considered to defend the area where this signal can be observed.

For SUSY events with lower mass of charged Higgs boson around 160 - 200 Gev further investigation is needed to reduce combinatorial background efficiently.
