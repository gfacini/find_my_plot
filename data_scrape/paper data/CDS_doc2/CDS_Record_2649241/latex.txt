Evaluation of theoretical uncertainties for simplified template cross section measurements of \(V\)-associated production of the Higgs boson

The ATLAS Collaboration

This note describes the estimate of theoretical uncertainties on the cross section of the \(VH\) Higgs production process in the simplified template cross section (STXS) framework.

## 1 Simplified template cross section categorization for \(Vh\)

The STXS framework has been designed to maximize the sensitivity of the Higgs boson cross section measurements while minimizing their theory dependence [1; 2]. In this framework cross section measurements are performed in mutually exclusive phase space regions ("STXS bins") specific to the different Higgs boson production modes, and can be easily combined across the decay channels. As the number of bins that is possible to measure increases with increasing amount of available data, several stages, corresponding to an increasing number of bins, are defined.

This note describes the estimate of theoretical uncertainties on the cross sections of the \(VH\) (\(V\)=\(W\), \(Z\)) Higgs production process in the STXS framework. Two different implementations of the split in STXS bins are considered for the evaluation of the uncertainties. The \(maximum\)\(split\) scheme corresponds to the finest categorization. The \(VH\) signal is divided into five production-decay modes: \(q\bar{q}\to Z(\ell\ell,\nu\nu)H\) denoted as qqZH, loop-induced \(gg\to Z(\ell\ell,\nu\nu)H\) or gg2H, \(q\bar{q}\to W(\ell\nu)H\) or W\(\overline{\text{u}}\)H. For each production-decay mode a forward region is defined based on the Higgs rapidity \(|y_{\text{H}}|>2.5\) (denoted as FWD), while the central region (\(|y_{\text{H}}|\leq 2.5\)) is furthermore divided into five intervals of the \(V\) boson transverse momentum \(p_{\text{T}}^{V}\) defined by cuts at 75, 150, 250 and 400 GeV and three regions depending on the number of extra jets (exactly 0, exactly 1 and \(\geq 2\), denoted as 0), 1) and GE2). Jets are defined using the anti-\(k_{t}\) algorithm with a radius parameter of \(R=0.4\), built from final state hadrons excluding those produced in the Higgs boson decay, and are required to have \(p_{\text{T}}>30\) GeV. The maximum split results in 80 separate bins shown schematically in Figure 1.

The choice of such a fine split as starting point allows to estimate the uncertainties in a very detailed way, with the possibility to merge them together adopting STXS bin schemes of different granularity, and making these results quite flexible.

The cross sections of each bin in the maximum split categorisation scheme are shown in Figure 2, obtained from the following Monte Carlo (MC) predictions generated at \(\sqrt{s}=13\) TeV and for a Higgs mass of \(m_{H}=125\) GeV. All \(q\bar{q}\)-initiated production processes are simulated using the Powheg v2 generator with the MiNLO (Multiscale Improved NLO) procedure [3], interfaced to the Pythia 8[4] MC generator applying the AZNLO tune [5], normalized to the most accurate theoretical cross section predictions currently available (next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) (QCD) and NLO (EW)) [2; 6]. The \(gg\)-initiated ZH contribution relies on the Powheg prediction, computed at LO in QCD, interfaced with Pythia 8 for the modelling of parton shower, underlying event and multiple parton interactions, normalized to the next-to-leading order and next-to-leading-logarithm (NLO+NLL) (QCD) cross section [2; 6]. All inclusive cross section numbers are obtained using the PDF4LHC15 PDF set including the photon contribution for the electroweak corrections.

A coarser categorization scheme is also considered, named _main_ scheme and outlined in Figure 3. The cross sections of each bin in the main split categorisation scheme is also shown in Figure 4.

No uncertainties on the predictions are considered in this plot. The cross section values are scaled by the Higgs branching ratio to bottom quark pairs BR(\(H\to b\bar{b}\)) = 0.582 from Ref. [6], and by the branching ratios for the leptonic \(V\) decays \(Z\to ll,\nu\nu\) and \(W\to l\nu\).

The \(x\)-axis labeling follows the notation introduced in Section 1, where the ZH process includes both qqZH and ggZH, and the first bin includes all contributions from the forward Higgs region (\(|y_{\rm H}|>2.5\)) from the sum of all production-decay modes. No uncertainties on the predictions are considered in this plot. The cross section values are scaled by the Higgs branching ratio to bottom quark pairs BR(\(H\to b\bar{b}\)) = 0.582 from Ref. [6], and by the branching ratios for the leptonic \(V\) decays \(Z\to ll\), \(\nu\nu\) and \(W\to l\nu\).

## 2 STXS uncertainties evaluation

This section details an evaluation of theory uncertainties on the \(VH\) cross section prediction in the STXS scheme outlined in Section 1, from missing higher orders in QCD, PDF+\(\alpha_{s}\) and parton shower, underlying event and hadronization effects. The parametrization of QCD uncertainties across the STXS bins is obtained following the recommendations of Ref. [7] (Section IV.6.3) and Ref. [2] (Section III.2), resulting in a set of uncertainties on the total cross section \(\Delta_{y}\) correlated across STXS bins, described in Section 2.1, and a set of migration uncertainties across the STXS bin boundaries, described in Section 2.2. Seven QCD uncertainty components are evaluated, and are all treated independently to each other. One component affects the total production cross section, while the other six are pure migration uncertainties. Four of these components are designed to model uncertainties across boundaries of \(p_{\rm T}^{V}\) (75 GeV, 150 GeV, 250 GeV and 400 GeV) while the other two affect jet bin migration across the \(\rm n_{jet}=1,2\) boundaries. While the uncertainties are derived in the maximum split categorization, it is possible to merge them to adapt to any coarser split, as detailed in Section 2.4.

All the migration uncertainties here described are evaluated starting from variations of the renormalization and factorization scales (\(\mu_{R}\), \(\mu_{F}\)). Note that the Higgs forward region (\(|y_{\rm H}|>2.5\)) is not included in the definition of the STXS bins considered to evaluate migration uncertainties. The uncertainty scheme presented here has been furthermore discussed within the LHC Higgs Cross Section Working Group.

In Section 2.3 the impact of PDF and \(\alpha_{s}\) variations on the cross section is described, while Section 2.5 introduces a first study of parton shower, underlying event and hadronization effects on the STXS bins.

### Overall uncertainties on the total \(VH\) cross section from QCD scale variations

The inclusive cross section uncertainties are introduced separately for the three main \(VH\) production modes (\(WH\), \(q\bar{q}\to ZH\) and \(gg\to ZH\)) and include the effect of renormalization and factorization scale variations by a factor of 3 around their nominal value. The variations are taken from the relative uncertainties on the inclusive cross sections reported in Chapter I.5.2C of the CERN Yellow Report 4 [2] and on the Web page reference [6] (considering the maximum between upward and downward variations for simplicity), and they are quoted in Table 1. These uncertainties are treated as correlated across all the STXS bins for each \(VH\) production mode (\(\Delta_{y}^{WH}\), \(\Delta_{y}^{q\bar{q}\to ZH}\) and \(\Delta_{y}^{gg\to ZH}\)), and furthermore correlated across Drell-Yan \(VH\) production modes.

### Migration uncertainties from QCD scale variations

Migration uncertainties across the STXS bins are evaluated starting from variations of the renormalization and factorization scales on the Powheg MC samples introduced in Section 1. Six correlated pairs of

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{l|l} Production mode & \(\Delta_{y}^{<VH>}\) \\ \hline \(WH\) & \(\pm 0.7\%\) \\ \(q\bar{q}\to ZH\) & \(\pm 0.6\%\) \\ \(gg\to ZH\) & \(\pm 25\%\) \\ \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 1: Overall cross section uncertainty from renormalization and factorization scale variations on \(WH\), \(q\bar{q}\to ZH\) and \(gg\to ZH\) from [2] and [6].

renormalization and factorization scale variations by a factor of two around the nominal values are considered (avoiding anti-correlated variations):

\[[\mu_{R}/\mu_{R}^{nom},\mu_{F}/\mu_{F}^{nom}]:[1/2,1][1,1/2][2,1][1,2][1/2,1/2][ 2,2].\]

Note that all variations, as well as the nominal prediction, are normalized to the cross section provided by the Powheg MC (separately for the nominal choice of \(\mu_{R}\), \(\mu_{F}\) and the scale variations). Differential uncertainties are derived from these scale variations for the variables which define the STXS bin split (the transverse momentum of the vector boson \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{V}\), the extra jet multiplicity \(\mathrm{n_{jet}}\)), which are then translated into relative variations in each inclusive \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{V}\) or \(\mathrm{n_{jet}}\) interval to estimate the magnitude of the migration uncertainties across the STXS bin boundaries.

Differential variations in inclusive \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{V}\) regions are defined for each of the three main \(VH\) production modes (\(WH\), \(q\bar{q}\to ZH\) and \(gg\to ZH\)) inclusive in \(\mathrm{n_{jet}}\) and vector boson decay. By taking the maximum of the six relative scale variations introduced above, a total relative uncertainty from Powheg (\(\mu_{R}\), \(\mu_{F}\)) variations in each inclusive \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{V}\) bin is estimated as shown in Figure 5. Note that the relative variations in the inclusive bins \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{V}>0\) GeV correspond to the overall cross section uncertainties described in Section 2.1.

Absolute uncertainties are derived from the relative variations independently in each of the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{V}\) regions (\(\Delta_{75}\), \(\Delta_{150}\), \(\Delta_{250}\) and \(\Delta_{400}\)), and correspond in this scheme to the \(\Delta\) parameters described in Section IV 6.4.2 of Ref. [7]. The absolute variations \(\Delta_{150}\), \(\Delta_{250}\) and \(\Delta_{400}\) are furthermore multiplied by a scaling factor \(r=0.5\), which will be motivated later.

For each \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{V}\) boundary \(X=75,150,250,400\) GeV a migration uncertainty is thus defined by an anti-correlated variation of \(\Delta_{X}\) for \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{V}\geq X\) and \(-\Delta_{X}\) for \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{V}<X\). Two different implementation schemes for the migration uncertainties are studied, depending on the impact of the \(-\Delta_{X}\) variation on the bins below the boundary \(X\): in _scheme-1_ the \(-\Delta_{X}\) is distributed across the full \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{V}\) spectrum below the boundary \(X\) resulting in a 'long-range' correlation scheme, while in _scheme-2_ it is distributed only on the first bin below the boundary \(X\) resulting in a'short-range' correlation scheme. This second choice might be a more sensible approach when treating migration uncertainties, which would tend to move events from one bin to the neighboring one.

The structure of the two uncertainty schemes for the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{V}\) categories is shown in Table 2 and 3 for _scheme-1_ and _scheme-2_ respectively, reporting the relative impact of the \(\Delta_{X}\) variations in each of the STXS \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{V}\) bins (corresponding to the structure outlined in Table IV.3 from Ref. [7]).

The relative impact of the anti-correlated migration uncertainties for each \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{V}\) boundary, for the \(WH\), \(q\bar{q}\to ZH\) and \(gg\to ZH\) production modes is shown along with the total uncertainty obtained from the quadrature sum of the four migration uncertainties and the overall cross section uncertainty in Figure 6 and 7 for _scheme-1_ and _scheme-2_ respectively. This total uncertainty is furthermore compared to the total differential uncertainty from Powheg scale variations with respect to \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{V}\) in Figure 8 in the _scheme-2_ implementation: to make sure that the former does not exceed too much the latter, the scaling factor \(r=0.5\) introduced before is applied to the absolute variations \(\Delta_{150}\), \(\Delta_{250}\) and \(\Delta_{400}\).

Note that the uncertainties defined across the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{V}\) bins of the STXS scheme apply in a correlated manner to any further sub-division in \(\mathrm{n_{jet}}\) of each \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{V}\) bin.

Migration uncertainties induced by the \(\mathrm{n_{jet}}\) boundaries are obtained in an analogous fashion, separately for each \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{V}\) bin and \(V\) decay mode, starting from relative (\(\mu_{R}\), \(\mu_{F}\)) variations in the inclusive \(\mathrm{n_{jet}}\) bins, and obtaining two absolute variations \(\Delta^{1}\) (\(\mathrm{n_{jet}}>=1\)) and \(\Delta^{2}\) (\(\mathrm{n_{jet}}>=2\)), from which both _scheme-1_ and _scheme-2_ implementations of \(\mathrm{n_{jet}}\) migration uncertainties are deduced. The \(\Delta^{1}\) and \(\Delta^{2}\) uncertainties are then correlated across the STXS \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{V}\) regions. Their impact is shown in Figures 9 and 10 respectively for _scheme-1_ and _scheme-2_, along with the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{V}\) migration uncertainties in the corresponding scheme and the

### Merging of STXS bins

The uncertainties presented in Section 2.2 and 2.3 have been evaluated in the maximum split scheme, and they are the ingredients to estimate the corresponding uncertainties in any coarser STXS bin scheme obtained by merging any subset of the bins of the maximum split scheme.

Calling \(\delta_{t}\) a relative systematic uncertainty on the generic maximum splitting STXS bins \(t\), if the cross section is measured in a coarser bin obtained by combining a group of bins, the overall relative uncertainty \(\delta_{\rm group}\) on the coarser bin is given by:

\[\delta_{\rm group}=\frac{\sum\limits_{t\in{\rm group}}\delta_{t}\sigma_{t}}{ \sum\limits_{t\in{\rm group}}\sigma_{t}},\]

where \(\sigma_{t}\) is the cross section of the bin \(t\). The uncertainty on the bin \(t\) is not included in the STXS scheme anymore (since the corresponding boundary is not part of it), but remains as residual acceptance uncertainty which will be applied within the experimental measurement as:

\[\delta_{t\ {\rm residual}}=\delta_{t}-\delta_{\rm group}.\]

As an example application of this merging procedure, the cross section prediction in the bins of the _main_ splitting scheme is reported in Table 4, along with the total impact of the full set of uncertainties described in this section derived according to the _scheme-2_ implementation, and the separate impact of QCD and PDF+\(\sigma_{s}\) uncertainties.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{l|c|c|c||c|c} process & \(p_{\rm T}^{V}\) boundaries [GeV] & Cross Section [fb] & Total unc [\%] & PDF+\(\alpha_{s}\) unc [\%] & QCD unc [\%] \\ \hline \hline WH & [0, 75[ & 216.4 & 3.5 & 1.9 & 3.0 \\ WH & [75, 150[ & 135.0 & 4.0 & 2.2 & 3.4 \\ WH & [150, 250[ & 41.24 & 4.1 & 1.8 & 3.6 \\ WH & [250, \(\infty\)[ & 12.16 & 4.4 & 2.2 & 3.9 \\ \hline ZH & [0, 75[ & 112.4 & 6.9 & 1.7 & 6.7 \\ ZH & [75, 150[ & 87.0 & 7.9 & 1.4 & 7.8 \\ ZH & [150, 250[ & 32.3 & 12 & 1.4 & 12 \\ ZH & [250, \(\infty\)[ & 8.33 & 10 & 1.7 & 10 \\ \hline \(gg\to ZH\) & [0, 75[ & 6.7 & 100 & 2.6 & 100 \\ \(gg\to ZH\) & [75, 150[ & 17.0 & 37 & 2.7 & 37 \\ \(gg\to ZH\) & [150, 250[ & 10.2 & 38 & 2.9 & 38 \\ \(gg\to ZH\) & [250, \(\infty\)[ & 1.94 & 41 & 3.3 & 41 \\ \hline \end{tabular}

The total uncertainty is estimated from the quadrature sum of the QCD and PDF+\(\alpha_{s}\) uncertainties (which are also shown separately in the last two columns), implemented as described in this section. Note that the ZH cross section includes both Drell-Yan component and loop-induced \(gg\to ZH\). The contribution from the forward Higgs region (\(|\mathrm{y_{H}}|>2.5\)) is not included in the Table.

### Study of parton shower, underlying event and hadronization uncertainties in the STXS scheme

A preliminary study of the impact of parton shower, underlying event and hadronization variations on the STXS bin split is presented in this section. It is noted that the set of variations here described can cover a series of uncertainty sources, part of which are already encoded in the migration uncertainties introduced in Section 2.2: for instance, perturbative shower uncertainties should be already covered by the \(\mathrm{n_{jet}}\) migrations (with the jet selection introduced in Section 1 the impact of non-perturbative effects should be sub-dominant). For this reason, they are not included in the total uncertainty estimate presented in Section 2.4, but they are nevertheless reported here as supporting material for further studies.

The variations are evaluated by comparing the nominal \(VH\) samples described in Section 1 with the following set of alternative samples:

1. Powheg + Herwig 7, with the H7-UE-MMHT tune of the underlying event and parton shower models [9, 10].
2. Powheg + Pythia 8, with variations of the multiple parton interaction (MPI) cut-off parameter between 1.91 GeV and 2.05 GeV (compared to the nominal value of 2.00 GeV).
3. Powheg + Pythia 8, with 6 variations of \(\mu_{R}\) and \(\mu_{F}\) by a factor of two around the nominal value (avoiding anti-correlated variations) for the parton shower final state radiation (FSR) emission.
4. Powheg + Pythia 8, with variations of 2 sets of eigentunes for the AZNLO parton shower tune, covering primordial \(k_{T}\) and initial state radiation (ISR) cut-off variations (described in Table 23 from Ref. [5]).

Variations from the 2 set of AZNLO eigentunes are found to be generally lower than 1% and therefore they are not shown here. Variations of the \(VH\) cross section across the STXS maximum split scheme bins are shown in Figure 13, 14 and 15 for the different production modes. The effect observed is moderate across the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{V}\) range, while more sizable at O(10-20%) across \(\mathrm{n_{jet}}\) bins.

The \(x\)-axis labeling follows the notation of PROCESS_PTVBIN_JETBIN introduced in Section 1. The gray band represents the statistical uncertainty on the nominal sample. The contribution from the forward Higgs region (\(|y_{\text{H}}|>2.5\)) is not included in the Figure. The cross section values are scaled by the Higgs branching ratio to bottom quark pairs BR(\(H\to b\bar{b}\)) = 0.582 from Ref. [6] and by the branching ratios for the leptonic \(V\) decays \(Z\to ll,\nu\nu\) and \(W\to l\nu\).

The \(x\)-axis labeling follows the notation of PROCESS_PTVBIN_JETBIN introduced in Section 1. The gray band represents the statistical uncertainty on the nominal sample. The contribution from the forward Higgs region (\(|y_{\rm H}|>2.5\)) is not included in the Figure. The cross section values are scaled by the Higgs branching ratio to bottom quark pairs BR(\(H\to b\bar{b}\)) = 0.582 from Ref. [6] and by the branching ratios for the leptonic \(V\) decays \(Z\to ll,\nu\nu\) and \(W\to l\nu\).

The \(x\)-axis labeling follows the notation of PROCESS_PTVBIN_JETBIN introduced in Section 1. The gray band represents the statistical uncertainty on the nominal sample. The contribution from the forward Higgs region (\(|y_{\rm H}|>2.5\)) is not included in the Figure. The cross section values are scaled by the Higgs branching ratio to bottom quark pairs \(\text{BR}(H\to b\bar{b})=0.582\) from Ref. [6] and by the branching ratios for the leptonic \(V\) decays \(Z\to ll,\nu\nu\) and \(W\to l\nu\).
