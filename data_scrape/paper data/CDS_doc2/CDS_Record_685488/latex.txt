## Abstract

The discovery potential of ATLAS in the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) Higgs search in the \(A/H\to\tau\tau\to lepton-hadron\) channel has been shown in the ATLAS Detector and Physics Performance Technical Design Report (TDR) [1] for \(150\leq m_{\rm A}\leq 450\) GeV. The results reported in the TDR were obtained from the study of fully simulated events and the low (\(10^{33}\) cm\({}^{-2}\)s\({}^{-1}\)) as well as the high (\(10^{34}\) cm\({}^{-2}\)s\({}^{-1}\)) luminosity scenario were considered.

It has been shown that it is possible to extend the study of \({\rm A/H\to\tau\tau}\) channel also to A masses larger than 500 GeV [2], [3] when both \(\tau\)'s decay hadronically. In this note the results of the study of the \(A/H\to\tau\tau\to lepton-hadron\) channel up to \(m_{\rm A}\)=800 GeV are reported. These results are obtained using the ATLAS fast simulation program [4] and only the low luminosity case has been considered.

It is shown that at \(m_{\rm A}\)=600 GeV for \(tg\beta\)\(>\,\sim 30\) and at \(m_{\rm A}\)=800 GeV for \(tg\beta\)\(>\,\sim 45\) the MSSM Higgs bosons A and H can be discovered in ATLAS in this decay channel with an integrated luminosity of 30 fb\({}^{-1}\). These results can be combined with the results from the \(hadron-hadron\) channel, to improve the ATLAS discovery potential for \({\rm A/H\to\tau\tau}\). The results obtained at lower A masses are compared in detail with the results presented in the TDR.

Introduction

In the Minimal Supersymmetric extension of the Standard Model (MSSM), two Higgs doublets are required, resulting in 5 physical states, referred to as \(\PHPH\), \(\PHPH\), \(\PHPH\), \(\PHPH\) (neutral lighter scalar), \(\PH\) (neutral heavier scalar) and \(\PH\) (neutral pseudoscalar). At the tree level their masses can be computed in terms of only two parameters, typically \(m_{\PH}\) and \(tg\beta\)  (the ratio of the vacuum expectation values of the two doublets).

The MSSM \(\PH\to\tau\tau\)   and \(\PH\to\tau\tau\)   rates are strongly enhanced with respect to the SM case over a large region of the parameter space.

A/H can be produced via two different mechanisms: for low values of \(tg\beta\), the \(gg\to A/H\to\tau\tau\)  (_direct production_) rates are dominant and significantly larger than in the SM case. For large values of \(tg\beta\), the production is dominated by \(q\overline{q},gg\to\mathrm{b}\overline{\mathrm{b}}\)\(A/H\)  (_associated production_).

For \(m_{\PH}\)\(>150\) GeV, the \(\PH\) and \(\PH\) bosons are degenerated in mass, so the signal rates in the \(\tau\tau\)-channel can be added, whereas a more complicated procedure depending on the experimental resolution and on the mass difference \(m_{\PH}\)-\(m_{\PH}\)  has to be applied for \(m_{\PH}\)\(<150\) GeV [5]. Higgs-boson masses below 120 GeV have not been considered in this channel because of the large resonant background from \(\mathrm{Z}/\gamma^{*}\to\tau\tau\)   decays.

Five A/H mass points have been studied here: \(m_{\PH}\)=150, 300, 450, 600, 800 GeV, and the _lepton-hadron_ decay channel is considered, which accounts for 46% of all \(\PH\to\tau\tau\)   decays [6].

For the first three masses, two different analyses are performed for the two different production channels, due to the topological and kinematical differences in the final states, while for the two higher masses only the associated production, that is largely the dominant production mechanism at high \(tg\beta\)  (by a factor \(\sim 30\) for \(m_{\PH}\)=800 GeV at \(tg\beta\)=45), is considered.

There are two very important detector requirements for the study of this channel. One important feature of the \(\PH\to\tau\tau\)   analysis is the possibility to reconstruct the invariant \(\tau\tau\) mass. The energies of the two \(\tau\)'s are evaluated from the energies of the \(\tau\) decay products, assumed to have the same direction of the \(\tau\)-parent; the neutrino energies are obtained solving a system containing the two \(p_{T}^{miss}\)  components. Therefore, it is crucial to have a very good \(p_{T}^{miss}\)  resolution [7]. A very good \(\tau\)-jet identification is also crucial, to have the possibility to reject the huge jet-background from different sources [8].

Details on the event generation and on the cross-sections used are reported in section 2. In section 3 the crucial detector performances are briefly reminded and the A mass reconstruction is discussed. In section 4 the _lepton-hadron_ channel analysis is described. The results for the lower masses are given in section 5 and compared with the ones reported in the TDR, while more details on the analysis and the results for the higher masses are given in section 6.

## 2 Event Generation and Production Cross-Sections

In all studies presented in the following, the events are generated with PYTHIA 6.152 with CTEQ5L structure functions.

The _associated production_ cross-sections and decay branching ratios have been derived, as described in detail in [3] and [9], using the programs HQQ and HDECAY [10] respectively. There are big uncertainties in the evaluation of the lower order cross-sections [11]. A final state \({\rm b}{\overline{\rm b}}\)\(A/H\) can be produced in _associated production in a gluon-gluon collision_ (\(gg\)\(\to\)\({\rm b}{\overline{\rm b}}\)\(A/H\)) or in the _b-quarks annihilation process_ (\(bb\to A/H\)), where the b-quarks are taken from the parton density functions. The second approach, that should be a reliable approach for the b-quarks [12], gives results higher by a factor of about 2.5. However it should include next-to-leading order corrections, which are not yet implemented in PYTHIA 6.205; in addition there are substantial uncertainties related to the b-quarks parton density functions. In view of this and because it was used in the past [1], [2], the gluon-gluon process has been used also here to calculate the relevant cross-sections.

Even considering the gluon-gluon process only, large uncertainties appear in the cross-section calculation: if the _running b-quark mass_ is used instead of the _pole-mass_ (used so far [1], [2]) to evaluate the Yukawa couplings significantly lower cross-sections (by a factor from 2 to 3) are obtained [9].

For reasons of consistency with the previous studies and due to the large theoretical uncertainties, the cross-sections used in the present study are those calculated with the associated production process using a fixed b-quark pole mass.

In all simulations the CTEQ5L structure function parametrisation has been used and the \(Q^{2}\) scale has been chosen to be \(Q^{2}=m_{\,H}\). All the cross-sections used here are calculated at leading order (LO).

The program HDECAY is used to calculate the total decay widths and the branching ratios; the A/H \(BR(\tau\tau)\) does not vary significantly over the large A/H mass range and is \(\sim 11\%\).

The associated production is the dominant production process for high A masses and \(tg\beta\), so only events from this process are considered here for \(m_{\,\rm A}\)=600 and 800 GeV. For lower A masses (\(\leq 450\) GeV), the direct and associated production mechanisms are both important, so events from both processes are studied.

The _direct production_ cross-sections and decay branching ratios have been derived in [9] using the program HIGLU and HDECAY [10].

Tables 8 and 9 given in the Appendix contain the values of the cross-sections, calculated in [9], that are used for the present study (columns 3-4 for associated production and columns 9-10 for direct production). Table 10 shows the datacard settings used in HQQ. In columns 5-8 of Tables 8 and 9, it is shown that there is agreement between the PYTHIA 6.205 and HQQ calculations for the same parameter settings.

Comparing with the cross-sections values used in TDR, calculated using different structure functions and using running quark mass (that is not the choice used here), the direct and associated cross-sections used here are \(\sim 30\%\) larger at \(m_{\,\rm A}\)=150 GeV; while the agreement is within \(\pm 20\%\) at \(m_{\,\rm A}\)=300 and 450 GeV.

There are physical differences between the events from the two different production processes (direct and associated):

* there are b-jets in \({\rm b}{\overline{\rm b}}\) A/H events
* the \(p_{\,T}\) distribution of the generated A/H is different. As it can be seen from Fig. 1,\(p_{T}\)A is larger in direct production, even if the difference is smaller, in particular at low masses, in PYTHIA 6.152 with respect to PYTHIA 5.7, used for the generation of the events for the TDR. This implies that in \(\mathrm{b\overline{b}}\)\(A\) events the two \(\tau\)'s from \(A\) tend to be more back to back, with important consequences on the \(m_{\tau\tau}\) reconstruction (see section 3.3) and on the analysis acceptance (see section 4).

The average \(p_{T}\) of the generated Z in inclusive and Z+jets events, as given by PYTHIA 6.152, is about 20 GeV, that is quite lower than the \(p_{T}\)A in each production process; this feature largely affects the \(m_{\tau\tau}\) reconstruction in Z events (see section 3.3).

For all backgrounds the cross-sections are taken from PYTHIA 6.152. It was checked, using a different PYTHIA version (PYTHIA 6.202), that the differences in the final results are below the statistical uncertainties [3].

## 3 Detector requirements for \(\mathrm{A/H}\rightarrow\tau\tau\) study

### \(\tau\)-jet identification

Excellent \(\tau\)-_identification performance_ to suppress the huge jet-background from various sources is necessary for the detection of \(\mathrm{A/H}\rightarrow\tau\tau\) for the channels where at least one \(\tau\) decays hadronically. In ATLAS the \(\tau\)-identification/jet-rejection has been studied with full simulations of signal and background events.

In the TDR, a hadronic jet with \(E_{T}>30\) GeV and \(|\eta|<2.5\) was identified as a \(\tau\)-jet if:

\(\bullet\)\(R_{e\hskip 0.8ptm}\)\(<\) 0.07, where \(R_{e\hskip 0.8ptm}\) is the jet radius computed using only the e.m. cells contained

Figure 1: Transverse momentum of the generated A boson in associated and direct production vs \(m_{\mathrm{A}}\) in PYTHIA 5.7 (open symbols) and PYTHIA 6.152 (full symbols).

in the jet;

\(\bullet\)\(\Delta E_{T}^{12}~{}<~{}0.1\), where \(\Delta E_{T}^{12}\) is the difference between the transverse energies contained in cones of size \(\Delta R=0.2\) and 0.1, normalized to the total jet transverse energy \(E_{T}\);

\(\bullet\)\(N_{tr}~{}=~{}1\), where \(N_{tr}\) is the number of reconstructed charged tracks with \(p_{T}>2\) GeV pointing to the cluster within \(\Delta R\)\(<\)0.3.

With these cuts the \(\tau\)_-jet-identification efficiency_ (\(\epsilon_{\tau}\)) is \(\sim 25\%\) for \(\tau\)'s from \(m_{\rm A}\)=150 GeV (\(<p_{T}>\sim 50\) GeV) and the \(jet-rejection\) goes from \(\sim 170\) to \(\sim 1700\) for jets in 30\(<\)\(p_{T}\)\(<\)150 GeV, depending on the \(p_{T}\) and \(\eta\) of the jet, on the jet type (light quark, gluon, b-jet) and on the underlying event [8].

The \(\tau\)-jet-identification has been preliminarly studied at higher \(p_{T}\) for the analysis of the higher \(m_{\rm A}\) points both in the _lepton-hadron_ final channel studied here and in the _hadron-hadron_ final channel studied in [3].

To do that, it was necessary to perform a new TDR-like full simulation (with GEANT3/DICE) of signal events \(A\rightarrow\tau\tau\to hadron-hadron\) (\(m_{\rm A}\)=600 and 800 GeV) and QCD events, generated in high \(\hat{p_{T}}\) windows, to enrich the sample of high \(p_{T}\) jets. About 35000 QCD events (containing \(\sim 10^{5}\) jets with \(p_{T}\)\(>\)15 GeV and \(\sim\)25000 jets with \(p_{T}\)\(>\)150 GeV) and about 9000 b\(\overline{\rm b}\) A signal events were fully simulated during 2001 in Mainz and in Milano.

With the TDR criteria described above, an \(\epsilon_{\tau}\sim 40\%\) for \(m_{\rm A}\)=800 GeV (\(<p_{T}>\sim 200\) GeV) and a \(jet-rejection\sim 2500\) against QCD jets with \(p_{T}\)\(>\)150 GeV can be achieved. It seems clear from the numbers quoted in this section that \(\epsilon_{\tau}\) increases with the \(\tau\)\(p_{T}\), so it increases with \(m_{\rm A}\).

This new study allowed also to realize that the criteria used in the TDR, optimized for the low \(m_{\rm A}\) and \(\tau\)\(p_{T}\) values, are not optimal for the high \(m_{\rm A}\) and \(p_{T}\). So a re-optimization of the criteria for high \(p_{T}\)\(\tau\)'s and jets is necessary. One way to do that could be to combine the ATLAS TDR criteria and the criteria used by CMS in [2] (CMS optimized \(\tau\)-identification criteria for high \(p_{T}\)). Asking for:

\(\bullet\)\(R_{em}<\) 0.12

\(\bullet\) CMS cuts

- 1 isolated track with \(p_{T}\)\(>\)40 GeV within \(\Delta R\)\(<\)0.1 from the jet axis

- track isolation: no other track with \(p_{T}\)\(>\)1 GeV in a cone of \(\Delta R\)=0.4

It must be noted that, while the isolation request is not very different respect to the TDR criterium on \(N_{tr}\), the request of having one high-\(p_{T}\) track very close to the jet axis is very effective in rejecting jets. An \(\epsilon_{\tau}\sim 45\%\) (\(\epsilon_{\tau}\sim 55\%\) - only CMS criteria) for \(\tau\)'s from \(m_{\rm A}\)=800 GeV can be achieved and the jet-rejection can be significantly improved to \(\sim 3500\) ( \(\sim 2000\) - only CMS criteria) for QCD jets with \(p_{T}\)\(>\)150 GeV.

The figures obtained using only the CMS criteria were used for the analysis of the _hadron-hadron_ decay channel [3], where it was important to maintain the signal acceptance as large as possible.

However, a larger st atistics of fully simulated events containing jets with high \(p_{T}\) is still needed to study better the jet-rejection in the high \(p_{T}\) range. The complete study of \(\tau\)-identification and jet-rejection will be performed using the large sample of fully simulated events, now available from ATLAS Data Challenge 1.

In the present analysis, \(\epsilon_{\tau}\) was assumed to increase from 25% to 40% for the five A masses from 150 to 800 GeV studied and \(\epsilon_{jet}\) was calculated using the TAUTAG routine 

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:7]

\(\bullet\)\(\overline{u_{1}}\), \(\overline{u_{2}}\) are the directions of the measured \(\tau\)-decay products

\(\bullet\)\(p_{x}^{m^{\,\prime}s}\), \(p_{y}^{m^{\,\prime}s}\) are the two \(p_{T}^{m^{\,\prime}s}\) components

The measurement uncertainties on \(p_{x}^{miss}\), \(p_{y}^{miss}\) combined with the assumption on the directions of the decay products often result in unphysical negative solutions for the neutrino energies. In this case the \(A\) mass cannot be reconstructed.

The mass resolution is proportional to

\[\sigma\,(p_{T}^{m^{\,\prime}s\,)}/|sin(\Delta\phi(jet-lept\,on))|\]

therefore both the \(p_{T}^{m^{\,\prime}s}\) resolution and the \(\Delta\phi\) separation are important in the \(\tau\tau\) mass reconstruction.

Two figures are shown here to explain better some details of the \(\tau\tau\) mass reconstruction, obtained using \(Z\)\(\rightarrow\)\(\tau\tau\)\(\rightarrow\)\(lept\,on\)\(-had\,on\) AT LFAST events.

The first one (Fig. 2) (similar to the one reported in [14] for fully simulated events) shows the different effects contributing to the width of the reconstructed \(\tau\tau\) mass. The first plot is the generated Z mass distribution. The second plot is the reconstructed \(m_{\,\tau\tau}\) from the \(\tau\) momenta, evaluated using the momenta from particle level information for all the \(\tau\)-decay products but assuming that their direction is the same as the charged decay prongs: there is a tail at low reconstructed masses and a long tail at high reconstructed masses. The other two plots show the correlation of these tails with the \(\Delta\phi\) and of \(\Delta\phi\) with the generated \(p_{T}\)Z. The fifth plot is the reconstructed mass when the events with \(\Delta\phi\) around \(\pi\) are discarded (\(2.7<\Delta\phi<3.5\)). The last plot shows the effect of using the neutrino momenta reconstructed from \(p_{T}^{miss}\)(the \(p_{T}^{m^{\,\prime}s}\) is reconstructed using the information of the calorimeters, that is in \(|\eta|<5\), so this plot shows the deterioration due to the \(p_{T}^{miss}\) reconstruction and to the \(\eta\) coverage); here the \(\Delta\phi\) cut is not applied, so this plot has to be compared with the second one. In the final reconstructed \(m_{\,\tau\tau}\) the reconstructed charged particle momenta and directions are used but this does not affect so much the final mass resolution, which is dominated by the assumptions on the directions and by the \(p_{T}^{miss}\) resolution. Table 1 shows the amount of high-mass tails and the reduction obtained from the \(\Delta\phi\) cut.

Figure 3 shows a comparison between the procedure for the \(\tau\tau\) mass reconstruction used here and that used by Zeppenfeld et al. [15]. In [15], the reconstructed \(\tau\tau\) mass is

Figure 2: Reconstruction of \(m_{\tau\tau}\) in \(\mathrm{Z\to\tau\tau}\) events: generated \(m_{Z}\), reconstructed \(m_{\tau\tau}\) using the information at particle level and the directions of the charged decay products, \(\Delta\phi\) between the \(\tau\) charged decay products _vs_\(m_{\tau\tau}\), \(\Delta\phi\)_vs_\(p_{T}Z\), reconstructed \(m_{\tau\tau}\) after cutting events with \(\Delta\phi\sim\pi\), reconstructed \(m_{\tau\tau}\) using the neutrino momenta calculated from the reconstructed \(p_{T}^{m_{\tau}s}\) (see the text for more details).

calculated as \(m_{\tau\tau}=m\,(lepton-hadron)/\sqrt{x_{\tau 1}*x_{\tau 2}}\), where \(x_{\tau 1}\) and \(x_{\tau 2}\) are the fractions of the \(\tau\) momenta carried by the charged particles. The A mass is reconstructed if \(x_{\tau 1}\) and \(x_{\tau 2}\) are positive and if \(\sqrt{x_{\tau 1}^{2}+x_{\tau 2}^{2}}<1\). It can be seen that the two methods give the same results, but the request \(\sqrt{x_{\tau 1}^{2}+x_{\tau 2}^{2}}<1\) done in [15] to accept the reconstructed mass rejects some _good_ events that are retained by the request to have two positive neutrino energies made here.

## 4 Event Simulation and Analysis

All events, signal events with \(m_{\rm A}\)=150, 300, 450, 600, 800 GeV and background events, were generated with PYTHIA 6.152 (CTEQ5L) and reconstructed in the ATLAS detector using ATLFAST 2.53.

Irreducible backgrounds for \(A/H\to\tau\tau\to lepton\)\(-hadron\) are \(\rm t\overline{t}\to WW\to lepton\)\(-\)\(\tau\)\(\to lepton\)\(-\)\(hadron\) and \(\rm Z/\gamma\)\(\to\)\(\tau\)\(\tau\)\(\to lepton\)\(-\)\(hadron\); reducible backgrounds are \(\rm t\overline{t}\to WW\)\(\to lepton\)\(-\)\(hadron\), \(W\)\(\to lepton\)\(+\)jets and \(\rm b\overline{b}\)\(\to lepton\)\(-\)\(hadron\), where a hadronic jet is identified as a \(\tau\).

High statistics samples were generated for the backgrounds because they are strongly reduced by the analysis cuts.

Table 4 summarizes the Montecarlo datasets used both for signal and background. It should be noted that both for signal and background, only events forced to decay to the _lepton-hadron_ (where lepton is electron or muon) channel were simulated; the cross-sections given in the last column of the table are therefore cross-sections multiplied by the branching ratio to _lepton-hadron_.

The \(\rm t\overline{t}\to WW\)\(\to\)\(lepton\)\(-\)\(\tau\) and the \(\rm t\overline{t}\to WW\)\(\to lepton\)\(-\)\(hadron\) processes were simulated together; according to the branching ratios, the first decay mode is expected to be about 15% of the second one. In addition some \(\rm t\overline{t}\) events were simulated in \(p_{T}\) bins (\(\hat{p_{T}}<\) 50, 50-100, 100-200, \(>\) 200 GeV) to enrich the sample with high \(p_{T}\) events and to cross-check the results obtained with the total sample.

The \(\rm b\overline{b}\) background was simulated in four different \(p_{T}\) bins to evaluate more correctly the contribution from high \(p_{T}\) events.

For the Z and W backgrounds, both inclusive and Z/W + jets events were simulated to cross-check the results obtained in the two cases. Zbb and Wbb events were not simulated separately because the cross-sections obtained using the ME approach can be lower, by a large factor (\(\sim 5\)), than the cross-sections obtained from the shower approach or the intermediate approach, used in PYTHIA for the inclusive production and for the Z/W+jets production respectively (see [11] for details). To be sure to not underestimate the Z background at high masses, also some Z in the mass windows (that is with \(\hat{m}\) in 200-500 GeV and \(>\)500 GeV) were simulated. Finally, some W+jets events were simulated in \(p_{T}\) bins to enrich the sample with high \(p_{T}\) events.

The corrections for the jet \(p_{T}\), as implemented in ATLFAST-b, is used for all jets except for \(\tau\)-jets (a dedicated \(\tau\)-jets correction is not available in ATLFAST-b). Fig. 4 shows that the correction is not needed for the \(\tau\)-jets, both from Z and from A with \(m_{\rm A}\)=800 GeV, in the \(p_{T}\) region of interest for this analysis. Applying the correction produces distortions in the low or in the high \(p_{T}\) region.

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:12]

Figure 4: Comparison between the \(p_{T}\) of the \(\tau\)-jet and the \(p_{T}\) of the hadronic part of the \(\tau\)-decay at particle level. The first three plots are for \(\tau\)’s from Z decay, the last three are for \(\tau\)’s from A decay with \(m_{\rm A}\)=800 GeV. “_Nocorr_” means that the \(p_{T}\) of the \(\tau\)-jet is not corrected, “ _Corr_” means that the \(p_{T}\) of the \(\tau\)-jet is corrected as all other jets (a dedicated \(\tau\)-jets correction is not available in ATLFAST-b).

The analysis is based on kinematical cuts, \(\tau\)-identification request and reconstructed \(m_{\tau\tau}\) cut. The same analysis criteria used in the TDR (_Standard A analysis_) are applied here:

\(\bullet\)\(p_{T}{}^{lepton}\)\(>\) 24 GeV and \(\big{|}\eta|^{le\,pton}\)\(<\) 2.5;

\(\bullet\) Isolation of the trigger lepton (in the case of leptons from b\(\overline{\rm b}\) we assume a rejection factor of 100);

\(\bullet\)\({\rm m}_{T}(lepton-p_{T}^{mis\,is})\)\(<\) 25 \(GeV\) (against the background containing W);

\(\bullet\)\(p_{T}^{miss}\)\(>\) 18 GeV;

\(\bullet\) at least one \(\tau\)-jet candidate with \(E_{T}{}^{\tau-jet}\)\(>\) 40 GeV and \(\big{|}\eta|^{\tau-jet}\)\(<\) 2.5;

\(\bullet\)\(1.8<\Delta\phi(\tau\)-jet\(-\)\(le\,\mu\,on)\)\(<\) 2.9. or 3.4 \(<\Delta\phi(\tau\)-jet\(-\)\(lepton)\)\(<\) 4.5 (against the Z background);

\(\bullet\)\({\rm m}_{\tau\tau}\)\(=\)\(m_{\rm A}\)\(\pm\)\(\Delta\) M (\(\Delta\)M = 1.5\(\sigma_{\tau\tau}\)).

Each jet passing the \(E_{T}{}^{jet}\) cuts is weighted using the \(\tau\)-identification efficiency (TDR criteria - see section 3.1); this allows to evaluate the backgrounds also after the large rejection due to all the analysis cuts.

The associated production events contain b-jets. Moreover the average \(p_{T}\) of the generated A in associated b\(\overline{\rm b}\)\(A\) production is lower compared to the direct A production and the difference increases with \(m_{\rm A}\)(see Fig. 1). This implies that in b\(\overline{\rm b}\)\(A\) events the two \(\tau\)'s from the \(A\)-boson tend to be more back to back, with two important consequences: a lower acceptance of the \(\Delta\phi(\tau\)-jet\(-\)\(le\,\mu\,on)\) cut, and a worse resolution from the system giving the neutrino energies and therefore a lower acceptance of the mass cut respect to direct production A events.

Figure 5 shows the resolution of the reconstructed \(\tau\tau\) invariant mass after the cut on \(\Delta\phi(\tau\)-jet\(-\)\(le\,pton)\); in b\(\overline{\rm b}\)\(A\) events the width of the \(\tau\tau\) invariant mass distribution is larger. The resolutions from the fully simulated events used for the TDR are shown for comparison: there is a worsening in the reconstructed mass resolution due to the softer \(p_{T}\)A spectrum in PYTHIA 6.152. Moreover the number of events for which the mass system cannot be solved increases (see Fig. 6).

Figure 7 shows a comparison of the variables relevant for the \(m_{\tau\tau}\) reconstruction for \(m_{\rm A}\)=450 GeV between direct and associated production. Due to the \(\Delta\phi\) distribution more peaked around \(\pi\) in the associated production (the \(p_{T}^{miss}\) resolution is similar also if \(\Sigma E_{T}\) is slightly larger in associated production), the reconstructed \(m_{\tau\tau}\) resolution is worse and the loss in acceptance due to the \(\Delta\phi\) cut is about a factor of 2 larger.

Therefore two different analyses, one optimized for the direct production process and the other one optimized for the associated production, are used:

- _Direct analysis:_

\(\bullet\) no b-tagged jets with \(p_{T}>\)15 GeV in \(\big{|}\eta\big{|}<\) 2.5 (against the t\(\overline{\rm t}\) and b\(\overline{\rm b}\) backgrounds);

\(\bullet\) all cuts of _Standard A analysis_ (kinematic, \(\tau\)-identification and mass cuts).

- _Associated analysis:_

\(\bullet\)\(\geq\)1 b-tagged jet (against the \(Z\) and W+jets backgrounds);

\(\bullet\) number of non b-tagged jets with \(p_{T}>\) 15 GeV in \(\big{|}\eta\big{|}<\) 3.2 less than 3 (against the t\(\overline{\rm t}\) backgrounds);

\(\bullet\) cuts of _Standard A analysis_ (kinematic, \(\tau\)-identification and mass cuts) _except the cut on \(\Delta\phi(\tau\)-jet\(-\)\(le\,pton)\)._To choose the b-jets, a b-tagging efficiency of 60%, with a rejection of 100 against other jets and of 10 against c-jets, has been randomly applied.

Due to the exclusive request to have or not to have b-tagged jets, the two analyses are not correlated. Therefore, after having applied them separately to both signal samples (direct and associated A production) and to background events, the significances can be combined.

Despite the smaller difference in the \(p_{T}\)A distribution between direct and associated production in PYTHIA 6.152, the combined analysis still improves the results by more than 10%.

The effects of the analysis cuts applied in sequence are reported in Table 3 for signal events with \(m_{\rm A}\)=150 GeV and for the backgrounds.

## 5 The lepton-hadron channel results at low masses

The results at low masses (\(m_{\rm A}\)\(\leq\)450 GeV) have been compared with the results reported in the TDR. The main differences in the new study can be summarized as follows:

* Events are generated using PYTHIA 6.152 instead of PYTHIA 5.7; the main difference is in the generated \(p_{T}\)A spectrum.
* For the signal, the cross-sections calculated as explained in section 2 are higher than the cross-sections used in TDR. Therefore two sets of results are given: one usingFigure 7: Distributions of \(\Delta\phi\), \(p_{T}^{miss}({\rm GeV})\), \(\Sigma E_{T}\) (GeV), \(p_{T}^{miss}\)resolution (GeV), reconstructed \(m_{\tau\tau}\) (GeV) without and with \(\Delta\phi\) cut for direct (white histograms) and associated production (colour histograms) for \(m_{\rm A}\)=450 GeV.

the TDR cross-sections for comparison with the previous results, the other using the new cross-sections.
* For the backgrounds, the cross-sections given by PYTHIA 6.152 are used.
* ATLFAST is used instead of full simulation. Besides the statistics (the number of fast simulated background events used in the present analysis is much larger than the number of fully simulated events used for the TDR), the relevant differences are:
* \(\tau\)-identification: the signal efficiency discussed in section 3.1 has been used; for the background the efficiency was obtained from the TAUTAG routine of ATLFAST-b, which is based on a parametrisation where the dependence on the \(p_{T}\) and \(\eta\) of the jets is taken into account but the dependence on the jet-type is not taken into account. In the TDR studies the \(\tau\)-identification criteria were applied jet by jet using the reconstructed quantities for signal events, while, for the backgrounds, due to the low statistics, it was factorized respect to the other cuts [14].
* The lepton isolation is taken from ATLFAST except for b\(\overline{\rm b}\) events, where a rejection factor of 100 is assumed; in the TDR studies the isolation efficiency obtained from full simulation was used.

Table 4 shows the signal and background rates for the three low mass points studied and for \(tg\beta\)=10 and an integrated luminosity of 30 fb\({}^{-1}\). The signal event rates correspond to the summed H+A rates. The acceptances for the signal are normalized to the event sample with \(\tau\tau\)\(\to lepton-hadron\), therefore in the calculation of the expected number of events the branching ratio to _lepton-hadron_ (= 0.46) has to be taken into account. The expected significances for \(tg\beta\)=10, calculated using Gaussian statistics, and the discovery \(tg\beta\) values (i.e. the \(tg\beta\) for which a significance of 5 is achieved) are also shown. The cross-sections used for the signal are the ones calculated as explained in section 2. The results obtained using the same cross-sections as in the TDR are shown in parentheses; they can be compared with the results in Table 19-35 of the TDR.

Table 4: Expected numbers of signal and background events for 30 fb\({}^{-1}\) for the _lepton-hadron_ channel. For the signal the new cross-section values (section 2) are used. The numbers in parentheses are obtained using the TDR cross-sections. (*) The acceptances are normalized to the event sample with \(\tau\tau\)\(\rightarrow\)\(lepton-hadron\) and therefore should be multiplied by the BR of 0.46. (**) Gaussian statistics is used as in the TDR.

Table 5 shows that there is good agreement in the evaluation of the background using different event samples. The results in Table 4 are obtained from the background samples with the highest statistics.

The final results are in reasonable agreement with the previous ones (in the TDR the combined significance is 8.9, 2.2 and 1.2 for \(m_{\rm A}\)=150, 300 and 450 GeV respectively), but there are some differences in the results at various steps of the analysis, that we have tried to explain.

For the signal process the expected event rates are similar, except for \(m_{\rm A}\)=150 GeV, where the lower mass cut has been increased (130 GeV instead of 120 GeV) against the Z background. The differences can be explained as due to the different generated \(p_{T}\)A spectrum giving different mass resolution and signal acceptance, and also to the different \(\tau\)-identification method.

Concerning the backgrounds, the total background is similar for the associated analysis while it is lower (by a factor from 2 to 4) for the direct analysis. In more detail:

- The \(\rm t\overline{t}\) background is larger in the new analysis, probably because of the average jet-rejection used in the fast simulation (in full simulation the rejection against jets from \(\rm t\overline{t}\) is the highest one, i.e. 1./0.0013). The irreducible \(\rm t\overline{t}\) background with a W decaying into \(\tau\) is about 15% of the total at generation level but, after all the analysis cuts, contributes about half of the total background. This background has been simulated together with the reducible \(\rm t\overline{t}\) background and, in conditions of low statistics, it is difficult to evaluate correctly its contribution at the end of the analysis.

- The W+jets background is smaller in the new analysis because of different (lower) cross-sections and of the average jet-rejection (in full simulation the rejection against jets from W+jets is the lowest one, i.e. 1./0.0045). The W+jets background is obtained both from the inclusive W sample and from the W+jets sample. As it can be seen in Table 5, the agreement is good (apart for \(m_{\rm A}\)=150, due maybe to the \(\hat{p_{T}}>15\) GeV cut in W+jets events).

The jet-rejection used here is on average 1./0.002 both for the \(\rm t\overline{t}\) and W+jets backgrounds, if applied after the \(E_{T}{}^{jet}\) cut. In fact after this cut, the jet \(E_{T}\) distributions are similar, with an average value of about 90 GeV.

\end{table}
Table 5: Expected numbers of background events for 30 fb\({}^{-1}\), as obtained from the direct/associated analyses for the three lowest mass points using different event samples.

- The bb background is now smaller: in the TDR it was evaluated with poor statistics and a conservative choice was adopted.

- The Z background, evaluated both from the inclusive Z sample and from the Z+jets sample, is now larger in particular for \(m_{\rm A}\)=150 GeV (also if the mass window has been reduced). In the TDR this background was evaluated by generating events in mass windows around each \(m_{\rm A}\) value, but this procedure is not correct because of the long reconstructed mass tail in Z events, as discussed in section 3.3.

This comparison between the TDR and the present results indicates that reliable results can be obtained using both full and fast simulations. It is impossible to have enough statistics of fully simulated background events. Therefore a reasonable evaluation of the background can be obtained using a fast simulation, based on parametrisation of the detector performance.

## 6 The lepton-hadron channel results at high masses

At higher masses, \(m_{A}>500\) GeV, the analysis is performed only with the events from the bb A production channel, due to the complete dominance of that production mode (see section 2).

The analysis criteria presented in the previous section were optimized for the high masses, starting at \(m_{\rm A}\)=450 GeV. Using the same analysis cuts given in the previous section, the final significances would be 20% lower.

The _Optimized analysis for the high masses_ uses the criteria of the _Associated analysis_, described in the previous section, with increased values for the following cuts:

\(\bullet\)\(p_{T}{}^{lepton}\)\(>40\) GeV and \(|\eta|^{lepton}\)\(<2.5\); isolation;

\(\bullet\) at least one \(\tau\)-jet candidate with \(E_{T}{}^{\tau-jet}\)\(>80\) GeV and \(|\eta|^{\tau-jet}\)\(<2.5\);

\(\bullet\)\(p_{T}^{miss}\)\(>40\) GeV.

Figure 8 shows the distributions of the most relevant variables with the analysis cuts applied in sequence, for signal events with \(m_{\rm A}\)=800 GeV. Figure 9 shows the same quantities for \(\rm t\overline{t}\) events, which represent the main background. It can be seen that the \(p_{T}\) of the lepton, of the \(\tau\)-jet and the \(p_{T}^{miss}\) are large at high signal masses; therefore it is possible to increase the cuts on these quantities maintaining a reasonable signal acceptance and improving the background rejection.

The effect of the analysis cuts applied in sequence is given in Table 6 for signal events with \(m_{\rm A}\)=800 GeV and for the backgrounds. For the evaluation of the background the samples generated in \(p_{T}\) bins have been used.

Figure 10 shows the distribution of \(m_{\tau\tau}\) after the optimized analysis for high masses for associated signal events with \(m_{\rm A}\)=800 GeV and \(tg\beta\)=45 and for the main background for an integrated luminosity of 30 fb\({}^{-1}\).

The final results for the three highest mass points are presented in Table 7, where the expected signal and backgrounds for \(m_{\rm A}\)=450, 600 and 800 and for \(tg\beta\)=20, 30 and 45 respectively are given for an integrated luminosity of 30 fb\({}^{-1}\). The signal corresponds to the summed H+A rates. The acceptances for the signal are normalized to the event sample with \(\tau\tau\)\(\rightarrow\)\(\it{lept}\)\(on\)\(-\)\(\it{hadron}\), therefore a branching ratio of 0.46 should be included. For \(m_{\rm A}\)=450 GeV also the results obtained with the combined analysis are reported. The Figure 8: For associated production signal events with \(m_{\rm A}\)\(=\)\(800\) GeV, the distributions of \(p_{T}{}^{lepton}\), \(m_{T}(lepton-p_{T}^{miss})\), \(p_{T}^{miss}\), \(p_{T}{}^{jet}\), \(p_{T}{}^{\tau-jet}\), \(m_{\tau\tau}\).

The dashed curves are for the \(\rm t\overline{t}\) events generated with \(\hat{p_{T}}>200\) GeV (normalized to the same event numbers).

Table 6: Effect of the analysis cuts applied in sequence. The number of events expected for 30 fb\({}^{-1}\)are given for \(\mbox{A}/\mbox{H}\rightarrow\tau\tau\) with \(m_{\mbox{A}}\)=800 GeV and for all the backgrounds.

expected significances for \(tg\beta\)=10 and the discovery \(tg\beta\) values are also shown. Poisson statistics has been used to calculate the significances since the number of signal events is small.

A detailed study of the systematic uncertainties for \(\rm A/H\to\tau\tau\) in the _hadron-hadron_ channel is presented in [3]. On the basis of the results shown there, where the effects of the detector resolution, \(\tau\)-identification, b-tagging and jet energy scale were studied, the significances obtained in this study have a systematic uncertainty of \(\pm 25\%\).

Figure 11 shows the discovery curve for the \(\rm A/H\to\tau\tau\to\it lepton\,on-hadron\) based on the results reported in this note. In the region \(m_{\rm A}\leq 450\) GeV the TDR curve is also shown for comparison.

## 7 Conclusions

The study of \(A/H\to\tau\tau\to\it lepton\,on-hadron\) at low luminosity has been extended to \(m_{\rm A}\)\(\sim\)1 TeV.

* At low masses (\(<\)\(\sim\)500 GeV) the two production channels, direct and associated, have been studied with two different uncorrelated analyses, which are then combined. The results have been compared with those reported in the TDR and were found to be in reasonable agreement, although differences at various steps of the analysis exist due to the different PYTHIA version, to the use of fast instead full simulation and to the different cross-sections for the backgrounds.

Table 7: Expected numbers of signal and background events for 30 fb\({}^{-1}\) for the _lepton-hadron_ channel after the _optimized analysis for high masses_. (*) The acceptances are normalized to the event sample with \(\tau\tau\)\(\rightarrow\)\(lepton-hadron\) and therefore should be multiplied by the BR of 0.46. (\({}^{\dagger}\)) Poisson statistics is used.

* At high masses, for large \(tg\beta\) values, \(A\) production is completely dominated by the associated \(\rm b\overline{b}\)\(A\) process. The significance is of the order of \(5\sigma\) even for \(m_{\rm A}\)=800 GeV and \(tg\beta\)\(<\)50 with an integrated luminosity of 30 fb\({}^{-1}\), with an expected number of events of the order of 15 and a background of about 5 events.

The results from the \(\rm A/H\to\tau\tau\) study in the _lepton-hadron_ and in the _hadron-hadron_[3] channels can be combined to improve the sensitivity. This extends the \(5\sigma\) discovery region up to masses of 1 TeV. Combining both channels the \(5\sigma\)\(tg\beta\) values are \(\sim 23\) for \(m_{\rm A}\)=600 GeV and \(\sim 34\) for \(m_{\rm A}\)=800 GeV. This is shown in Fig. 12, where the TDR results from the _lepton-hadron_ channel at low masses and the combined _lepton-hadron_ (present analysis) and _hadron-hadron_ ([3]) results at high masses are presented. This is the present ATLAS discovery potential for the \(\rm A/H\to\tau\tau\) channel.
