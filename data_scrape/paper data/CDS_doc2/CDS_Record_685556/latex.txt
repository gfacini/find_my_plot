We present an analysis of the results obtained by running the default PDFLIB and the LHAPDF Parton Distribution Function (PDF) modules on the Herwig event generator. The ntuples, containing the events, returned by the generator for five physics processes were compared and searched for any differences, so as to see if the LHAPDF module is a reliable module to use.

## 1 Generating the Processes

Five physics processes were tested, and each one was specifically chosen to be sensitive to the PDF modules. Furthermore, the generations of the events with the two generators were done using the same seeds for the Monte-Carlo in order to eliminate any differences that might appear from unequal initial conditions.

Three out of these five processes were also run with a proton-anti-proton beam. So there are actually sixteen runs of the Herwig generator - two for each PDF module - and the tested processes were:

\(\bullet\)**QCD direct photon pair production**

This is a standard QCD process producing a pair of photons according to \(q\bar{q}\to\gamma\gamma\) and then the subprocess running is \(g+g\to g+\gamma\). These processes correspond to the Herwig commands "iproc 2200" and "ihpro 47".

The total number of events was 45000 and was chosen to have a good statistical group of photons. It should be noted also that only the photons from the primary vertex were kept, giving a total of 90000 photons - a pair for each event.

\(\bullet\)\(W^{\pm}\)**production through the Drell-Yan process**

The process is \(q\bar{q}\to W^{\pm}\to q^{\prime}\bar{q}^{\prime\prime}\) and corresponds to the Herwig command "iproc 1400".

\(\bullet\)\(Z^{0}\)**production through the Drell-Yan process**

The process is \(q\bar{q}\to Z^{0}\to q^{\prime}\bar{q}^{\prime\prime}\) and corresponds to the Herwig command "iproc 1300".

\(\bullet\)**Single top production**

The two processes used were "iproc 2005" and "iproc 2006". They are single anti-top productions by W-boson exchange: \(\bar{c}\bar{b}\to\bar{s}\bar{t}\) and \(s\bar{b}\to c\bar{t}\), respectively.

As in the photon production case, only the anti-top quarks coming from the primary vertex were filled in the ntuple and used for histogramming.

### Distribution Shapes

No deviation could be observed in the distribution shapes and the shapes for the two PDF modules were similar within statistical margins for both the processes. This can be easily observed in the histograms to follow - figures 3 to 42 - where, in the case of the plots in the left of each page, the two overlaid shapes fit nicely. In these histograms, the solid line is for the LHAPDF results while the error bars are for the PDFLIB.

In all the production cases, the \(P_{T}\) and the \(\eta\) were plotted, with the \(P_{T}\) histogram being given in log scale. The histograms can be divided into three logical sets. The first set concerns the \(W^{\pm}\), \(Z^{0}\) and \(\gamma\) production with a proton-proton beam. Notice that the \(W^{+}\) and \(W^{-}\) are plotted separately. Then the second set concerns the same productions as the first one, but with a proton-anti-proton beam. And last, the third set concerns the 2005 and 2006 top production processes.

The ratio, also, of the histograms, both for the \(P_{T}\) and \(\eta\), is plotted next to each one, in the right side of each page. It shows a nice fit in the area of unity for all the productions and only in regions with very low statistics (where the entries of the bins fell to only about ten) one can observe any deviation. Here it must be stressed that this deviation is of no importance, as it occurs only because the entry points are so few. So for example if there is only one entry from the first module and four from the second, the ratio will be 4, which does not of course have any statistical significance as there is no statistical population to give meaning to the ratio. Furthermore, these regions are actually regions which are not cover by the detector's capacity, making them even more unimportant. The dashed horizontal line in the plot is the unity and is there just to help with the visualization.

## 4 Summary

Five physics processes were generated with two different PDF modules - the LHAPDF and the PDFLIB - with the Herwig event generator both for a \(pp\) and a \(p\overline{p}\) beam. The results returned, were compared in order to seek for any differences that might appear due to the use of these different PDF modules.

Fortunately, no apparent difference was found and the two modules returned the same results within statistical margins. This shows that the LHAPDF is a reliable module to use and one shouldn't expect any discrepancies.
