HL-LHC prospects for diboson resonance searches and electroweak vector boson scattering in the \(WW/WZ\to\ell\nu qq\) final state

The ATLAS Collaboration

###### Abstract

This note presents the prospects of searches for new heavy resonances decaying to dibosons (\(WW/WZ\)) and measurements of electroweak \(WW/WZ\) production via vector boson scattering in association with a high-mass dijet system in the \(\ell\nu qq\) final states. The prospects are presented for an integrated luminosities of 300 and 3000 fb\({}^{-1}\) of proton-proton collisions at \(\sqrt{s}\)= 14 TeV to be recorded with the ATLAS detector at the high-luminosity LHC assuming the average number of \(pp\) interactions per bunch crossing to be 200. The cross-section for electroweak \(WW/WZ\) production in vector boson scattering processes is expected to have an observation greater than \(5\sigma\) at 300fb\({}^{-1}\) and to be measured to within 6.5% at 3000 fb\({}^{-1}\). The diboson resonance searches are interpreted for sensitivity to a heavy scalar singlet, a simplified phenomenological model with a heavy gauge boson and a Randall-Sundrum model with a spin-2 graviton. With 3000 fb\({}^{-1}\)of \(pp\) data, the exclusion limit reach for the new resonance is extended to 4.9 TeV in the heavy gauge boson model and 3.3 TeV in the Randall-Sundrum model. These are improvements of approximately 1 TeV in comparison to existing mass limits. With 3000 fb\({}^{-1}\)of \(pp\) data, the \(5\sigma\) discovery reach is 3.3 TeV for the heavy gauge boson model and 1.7 TeV for the Randall-Sundrum model.

## 1 Introduction

Searches for new heavy particles are an important part of the physics program at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and have been intensively performed over a broad range of final states to uncover physics beyond the Standard Model (SM). Many of these searches are motivated by models that aim to resolve the hierarchy problem, an unnaturally large difference in the strength between the electroweak and gravity forces, such as the Randall-Sundrum (RS) model with a warped extra dimension [1] or by models with composite Higgs bosons [2]. Possible extensions to the SM, such as extended Higgs sectors as in the two-Higgs-doublet model (2HDM) [3] or extended gauge sectors as in Grand Unified Theories [4; 5; 6], are also motivations for new heavy particle searches. No clear hint of new heavy particles has been observed to date at the LHC, placing strong constraints on the production of such new particles by both ATLAS and CMS [7; 8; 9].

The quest for new phenomena will therefore continue in future runs of the LHC and in future collider experiments. This note presents prospects for the search for resonances decaying to diboson (\(WW\) or \(WZ\), collectively called \(VV\) where \(V=W\) or \(Z\)) in the semileptonic channel where one \(W\)-boson decays leptonically and the other \(W\) or \(Z\)-boson decays to quarks (\(\ell\nu qq\) channel). The results include sensitivity for such new resonances based on an integrated luminosity of 300 or 3000 fb\({}^{-1}\) of \(pp\) collisions at \(\sqrt{s}\)= 14 TeV using the ATLAS detector. An average number of 200 additional inelastic \(pp\) collisions per bunch-crossing (denoted "pile-up" in the rest of the note) is assumed. Searches in other semileptonic and fully hadronic decay channels are expected to have similar sensitivities at high masses, as observed in the ATLAS searches with Run 2 data [7].

While the presence of resonances is the most dramatic signal for new phenomena, they may be too heavy or broad to be clearly seen at the LHC. The study of the high-energy scattering between the longitudinal components of the vector bosons (vector boson scattering or VBS) is a perfect case to search systematically for the presence of new particles or interactions behind the breaking of the EW symmetry. In fact the scattering amplitude of the VBS processes, in absence of the Higgs boson, would grow indefinitely with the center-of-mass energy, while it is finite if the Higgs boson is exactly the one predicted by the SM and its contributions are included. This important high-energy behavior still needs to be tested experimentally and it will be one of the main drivers of the physics program for the HL-LHC, the project upgrade of the LHC where the luminosity is expected to increase by a factor of 10 with respect to current conditions. ATLAS has recently presented results of VBS searches in the \(W^{\pm}W^{\pm}\) channel [10] and \(WZ\) channel [11] with 6.9\(\sigma\) and 5.6\(\sigma\) evidence respectively. The existing Run-2 VBS measurements have focused on channels involving the fully leptonic boson decays (\(W(\ell\nu)\) and \(Z(\ell\ell)\))1 and photons. The semileptonic channels, i.e., \(V(qq^{\prime})Z(\nu\nu)\), \(V(qq^{\prime})W(\ell\nu)\) and \(V(qq^{\prime})Z(\ell\ell)\), can however offer some interesting advantages. The \(V(qq^{\prime})\) branching fractions are much larger than the leptonic branching fractions and the use of jet substructure techniques with large-radius jet reconstruction allows to reconstruct and identify the \(V\)-boson produced in the high-\(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) region, which is the most sensitive to new physics effects. The sensitivity of the ATLAS experiment to VBS in the \(V(qq^{\prime})W(\ell\nu)\) final state, assuming an integrated luminosity of 300 or 3000 fb\({}^{-1}\) of \(pp\) collisions at \(\sqrt{s}\)= 14 TeV, will also be studied. The analysis is based on event selection and classification similar to those used in the Run 1 and Run 2 ATLAS searches [8; 9].

## 2 Simulation Samples

Both exotic resonance and VBS analyses use generator-level samples of the main signal and background processes, combined with the parameterizations of the detector performance (muon and jet reconstruction and selection efficiencies and momentum resolutions) expected at the HL-LHC from fully simulated samples. The parametrized detector resolutions are used to smear the generator-level particle transverse momenta, while the parametrized efficiencies are used to reweigh the selected events [12]. All generated samples were produced at \(\sqrt{s}\)= 14 and normalized to luminosities of 300 or 3000 fb\({}^{-1}\) when the results are presented.

### Signal simulation

The prospect for resonance searches presented in this article are interpreted in the context of three different models: a heavy vector triplet (HVT) model [13; 14], a RS model [1] and a narrow heavy scalar resonance. The parameters of these models are chosen such that along the whole generated mass range, the resonance widths are less than 6% of the mass value, which is smaller than the detector resolution.

The HVT model [13; 14] provides a broad phenomenological framework to test a range of different scenarios involving new heavy gauge bosons and their couplings to SM fermions and bosons. In this model, a triplet \(\mathcal{W}\) of colorless vector bosons is introduced with zero hypercharge. This leads to a set of nearly mass-degenerate charged (\(W^{\prime\pm}\)) and neutral (\(Z^{\prime}\)) states, collectively denoted by \(V^{\prime}\). The masses of the \(W^{\prime\pm}\) and \(Z^{\prime}\) bosons are taken to be the same in this prospect study. Two explicit HVT scenarios are used as benchmarks for interpretation of the results. The first scenario referred to as model A, reproduces the phenomenology of weakly coupled models based on an extended gauge symmetry [15]. The second DY scenario, referred to as model B, implements a strongly coupled model as in composite Higgs models [2].

The RS model postulates the existence of a warped extra dimension in which gravity propagates [1]. In the original "RS1" scenario only the effects of gravity are allowed to propogate in the extra dimension, while in the extended "bulk RS" scenario SM fields are also allowed to propagate in the extra dimension [16]. In both models [1; 16] the propagation in the extra dimension leads to the presence of a tower of Kaluza-Klein (KK) excitations of the graviton (denoted \(G_{\rm KK}\)). The bulk scenario avoids constraints on the original RS1 model from limits on flavour changing neutral currents and electroweak precision test by suppressing the graviton couplings to light fermions. This lead to the predominant decay modes of the bulk graviton to be to pairs of top-quarks, higgs bosons, and electroweak gauge bosons. The bulk KK gravitons are produced via both quark-antiquark annihilation and gluon-gluon fusion (ggF) processes, with the latter dominating due to suppressed couplings of the graviton to light fermions. The strength of the graviton interaction depends on the dimensionless coupling constant \(k/\overline{M}_{\rm Pl}\), where \(k\) corresponds to the curvature of the warped extra dimension and \(\overline{M}_{\rm Pl}=2.4\times 10^{18}\) is the effective four-dimensional Planck scale. This note assumes the value of \(k/\overline{M}_{\rm Pl}=1\).

The last model considered is an empirical model with a narrow heavy scalar resonance produced via the ggF and vector-boson-fusion (VBF) mechanisms and decaying directly into \(VV\). The width of this new scalar is assumed to be negligible compared to the detector resolution. This benchmark model is used to explore sensitivity to extended Higgs sectors.

Signal events for the HVT and bulk RS models are generated with MadGraph5_aMC@NLO v2.2.2 [17] at leading order (LO) using the NNPDF23LO parton distribution function (PDF) set [18]. For the productionof resonances in the HVT model, both the DY and VBF mechanisms are simulated. In the case of the heavy scalar model, signal events are generated at next-to-leading order (NLO) via the ggF and VBF mechanisms with Powheg-Box v1 [19; 20] and the CT10 PDF set [21].

For all signal models and production mechanisms, the generated events are interfaced to Pythia v8.186 [22] for parton showering, hadronization, and the underlying event. This Pythia interface includes the A14 set of tuned parameters [23] for events generated with MadGraph5_aMC@NLO at LO and the AZNLO set of tuned parameters [24] for events generated with Powheg-Box at NLO.

The electro-weak (EWK) \(VVjj\) production is modeled using MadGraph5_aMC@NLO v2.3.3 [17], plus Pythia 8 [25] for fragmentation. The NNPDF30LO PDF set [18] is used. The EWK \(VVjj\) samples are generated with two on-shell \(V\) bosons, with one \(V\) boson decaying leptonically (\(Z\to\ell\ell\) with \(\ell=e,\mu\), \(W\to\ell\nu\) with \(\ell=e,\mu,\tau\)), and the other \(V\) boson decaying hadronically. For each sample, all of the purely-electroweak tree-level diagrams (i.e. \(\mathcal{O}(\alpha_{EW}^{6})\) diagrams) that contribute to the final state are included: VBS diagrams, non-VBS electroweak diagrams without \(b\)-quarks in the initial final states, and non-VBS electroweak diagrams with \(b\)-quarks in the initial final states. Example diagrams of these processes are shown in Figure 1. The non-VBS diagrams are suppressed by the analysis selction, e.g. diagrams including a \(Wtb\) vertex, are suppressed by requiring that the tagging jets are not \(b\)-tagged (\(b\)-veto). (Section 4).

Diagrams that contain a mixture of electroweak and QCD vertices (i.e. \(\mathcal{O}(\alpha_{EW}^{4}\alpha_{S}^{2})\) diagrams) are not included in these samples, and are not part of the signal definition. Such processes are accounted for by the background samples (\(t\bar{t}\), single-top, and diboson).

### Background simulation

Simulated background event samples are used to derive the main background estimates. The main background sources are \(W\) bosons produced in association with jets (\(W\)+jets), with significant contributions from top-quark production (both \(t\bar{t}\) pair and single-top), non-resonant vector-boson pair production (\(ZZ\), \(WZ\) and \(WW\)) and \(Z\) bosons produced in association with jets (\(Z\)+jets). Background originating from multi-jet processes are expected to be negligible due to the event selection requirements described in Section 4. The list of simulated background samples and predicted generator cross-section values at 14 TeV are shown in Table 1.

Figure 1: Example diagrams of purely-electroweak diagrams generated in the \(VVjj\) process: VBS diagram (a), non-VBS diagram without \(b\)-quarks (b), and non-VBS diagrams with \(b\)-quarks (c).

\(W\)+jets events are generated using MadGraph5_aMC@NLO v2.3.2 [17] at LO using the NNPDF30NLO PDF set [18], plus Pythia 8[25] for fragmentation. They are simulated for up to one additional parton at NLO and up to two additional partons at LO. The generation of \(Z\)+jets events is done using Powheg-Box event generator plus PYTHIA8[25] for showering and fragmentation. The generation use the CT10 PDF set [26] and the AZNLO CTEQL1 tune for Powheg-Box+Pythia[24]. \(Z\to\tau\tau\) and \(W\to\tau\nu\) events are included in the \(Z\)+jets and \(W\)+jets samples, respectively. Diboson processes with one of the bosons decaying hadronically and the other leptonically are simulated using Powheg-Box v2[27] with the CT10 PDF set and showered/hadronized using Pythia 6[28].

For the generation of top-quark pairs, the Powheg-Box event generator with the CT10 PDF set in the matrix element calculations is used. Electroweak \(Wt\)-channel single-top quark events are generated using the Powheg-Box v1 event generator [29; 30; 31]. This event generator uses the four-flavour scheme for the NLO matrix-element calculations together with the fixed four-flavour PDF set CT10f4 [26]. For all top-quark processes, top-quark spin correlations are preserved (for \(t\)-channel, top-quarks are decayed using MadSpin[32]). The parton shower, fragmentation, and underlying event are simulated using Pythia 6.428 [28] with the CTEQ6L1[33] PDF set and the corresponding Perugia 2012 tune [34]. The top-quark mass is set to 172.5 GeV. The EvGen v1.2.0 program [35] is used to decay bottom and charm hadrons for the Powheg-Box samples.

## 3 Object Selection

Studies on the performance of the upgraded phase-II ATLAS detector at the HL-LHC are documented in Ref [36; 37]. The performance studies assume a center of mass energy of \(\sqrt{s}=14\) TeV with the average number of \(pp\) interactions per bunch crossing of 200. The upgraded detector is fully simulated for the detector response. The results of these studies were used to derive functions that provide parameterized estimates of the detector performance for different physics objects. These functions are \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\)- and \(\eta\)-dependent2 and are applied to the generator-level quantities to emulate energy resolution, efficiencies and mis-identification (fake) rates. Efficiency functions are available for the identification of electron, muon and heavy quark associated with jets (\(b\)-tagging). Functions to parameterize fake rates are also extracted

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|} \hline \hline Background Process & Generator & Cross-section [pb] \\ \hline \(W\)+jets & MadGraph5\_aMC@NLO +Pythia 8 & 6.01\(\times 10^{4}\) \\ \(Z\)+jets & Powheg-Box+Pythia 8 & 6.17\(\times 10^{3}\) \\ \(t\bar{t}\) & Powheg-Box+Pythia 6 & 8.24\(\times 10^{2}\) \\ single-top \(Wt\) channel & Powheg-Box+Pythia 6 & 8.05\(\times 10^{1}\) \\ SM \(WW/WZ\to\ell\nu qq\) & Powheg-Box+Pythia 6 & 5.99\(\times 10^{1}\) \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}

for \(b\)-tagging (light flavor jets and jets from pile-up collisions can be mis-identified as \(b\)-jets). Energy resolution functions are applied to alter the four-momenta of generator-level objects by a random amount corresponding on average to the expected resolution of the detector. The object selection criteria are applied to the altered four-momenta.

The following objects are used in this analysis:

* Generator-level electrons or muons are required to be isolated by ensuring that the sum of the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) of other final state charged particles within \(\Delta R=10\,\mathrm{GeV}/p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\ell}\) around the lepton is less than 6% of the lepton \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\). Lepton identification efficiencies are applied to the selected isolated electrons and muons. Both electrons and muons are required to pass the tight identification criteria [36], which is the most effective to reduce mis-identified leptons. Once the identification efficiencies are applied, the energies of the remaining leptons are smeared according to the expected detector resolution. They are both required to have \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>27\) GeV and be within the acceptance of the inner detector (\(|\eta|<1.37\) or \(1.52<|\eta|<2.47\) for electrons and \(|\eta|<2.5\) for muons). The \(\eta\) acceptance cuts are chosen to match those used in previous searches even though the HL-LHC acceptances are expected to increase since the leptons in our signal models are expected to be mainly produced centrally in the detector.
* Small-\(R\) jets (denoted by \(j\) below): The anti-\(k_{t}\) algorithm [38] with a radius parameter of R = 0.4 is used to reconstruct small-\(R\) jets from final state generator-level particles. Pile-up jets are included from a pileup library built with the assumption of the average 200 proton-proton interactions per bunch crossing. The transverse momentum of the jets is smeared by 10-25% using an \(\eta/p_{\mathrm{T}}\)-dependent parameterization; the jets are requested to satisfy \(|\eta|<2.5\) and have a minimum \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) of 20 GeV. The identification of jets originating from \(b\)-quarks is done by finding jets with generator-level \(b\)-hadron within a cone of \(\Delta R<0.4\) around the jet direction. The \(b\)-tagging performance for these jets is then modeled by applying (\(\eta/p_{\mathrm{T}}\)-dependent) \(b\)-tagging efficiency function corresponding to a mean efficiency of 70% in simulated \(t\bar{t}\) events. The \(b\)-tagging mis-identification rate is also applied to light flavor quark and gluon jets (including pile-up jets) to account for jets that do not contain \(b\)-hadrons but are accidentally identified as \(b\)-jets. A track confirmation algorithm is used to mitigate pile-up by selecting jets with generator-level charged hadrons that can be traced back to the primary vertex; the track confirmation efficiencies are applied to jets from hard-scattering and pile-up interactions.
* Large-\(R\) jets (denoted by \(J\) below): The anti-\(k_{t}\) algorithm with a radius parameter of R = 1.0 is used to reconstruct large-\(R\) jets. The large-\(R\) jets are trimmed using the standard ATLAS trimming parameters of \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) fraction = 0.05 and R = 0.2 [39]. It is assumed that the performance of a future \(W/Z\)-boson tagger at the HL-LHC conditions will have similar, if not better, performance as existing boson taggers. To simulate the effect of Run-2 \(W/Z\)-boson tagging performance [40; 41] on local-calibrated topologically-clustered jets [42], events which contain a large-\(R\) jet are scaled by the expected boson tagging efficiency for the \(V\to qq\) with kinematics corresponding to the large-\(R\) jet. The tagging efficiencies are calculated from fully-simulated 13 TeV Monte-Carlo (MC) samples as the fraction of events with a large-\(R\) jet passing the tagger to the number of events with large-\(R\) jets within \(|m(J)-m(W/Z)|<50\) GeV, where \(m(J)\) is the large-R jet mass. The mass cut imposed by the tagger is always smaller then the 50 GeV window applied. The mass window cut is applied whenever the \(W/Z\)-boson tagger scale factors are applied and used to incorporate the shaping effect of a mass cut on the background distributions. Only the leading large-\(R\) jet is considered for the tagging efficiency calculation. Separate efficiencies are calculated for each background and signal processes and applied as scale factors on the 14 TeV simulated samples. The \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) (mass) of the large-\(R\) jets is smeared using a Gaussian (Log-Normal) distribution with scale parameters derived as a function of \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) and \(m(J)/p_{\mathrm{T}}\). The large-\(R\) jets in events must have \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>200\) and \(|\eta|<2.0\).
* Missing transverse momentum (with its magnitude \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\), refered to as the missing transverse energy below): The missing transverse momentum is determined as the negative sum of the transverse momenta of all generator-level particles, except neutrinos, within the detector acceptance. The \(x\) and \(y\) components of the missing transverse momentum are smeared with the detector resolution and are used to obtain the total missing transverse energy in the event [43].
* Overlap Removal: Energy deposits in the calorimeter from electrons and muons can be reconstructed as jets. In this analysis, the jets are reconstructed from stable generator-level particles excluding muons and electrons from the decay of \(W\), \(Z\), Higgs and \(\tau\) particles as well as neutrinos. To avoid double counting an electron as a jet, the nearest small-\(R\) jet to an electron is removed from the list of jets if \(\Delta R(e,\mathrm{jet})<0.2\). Additionally, small-\(R\) jets within \(\Delta R=1.0\) of any large-\(R\) jet in the event are removed from the list of jets.

## 4 Event Selection

Events are required to have exactly one lepton satisfying the selection criteria described above. It is assumed that the effect of trigger thresholds is negligible for the selected leptons with \(p_{T}\) studied in this note. Events are further required to contain a hadronically-decaying \(W/Z\) candidate, reconstructed either from two small-\(R\) jets, defined as the resolved channel, or from one large-\(R\) jet, designated the boosted channel (see below).

The missing transverse energy \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\) has to be greater than 60, which suppresses multijet background to a negligible level. By constraining the \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\) + lepton system to be consistent with the \(W\) mass, the \(z\) component of the neutrino (\(\nu\)) momentum can be reconstructed by solving a quadratic equation. The smallest solution is chosen and in the case where the solution is imaginary, only the real part is taken.

The analyses for the resonance search are detailed in Section 4.1 and the VBS search in Section 4.2. The event selections for the two analyses are considered separately and events can be selected by both analyses.

### Resonance Search

The presence of narrow resonances is searched for in the distribution of reconstructed diboson mass using the signal shapes extracted from simulation of benchmark models. The invariant mass of the diboson system (\(m(WV)\)) is reconstructed from the leptonic \(W\) candidate and hadronic \(W/Z\) candidate, the latter of which is obtained from two small-\(R\) jets in the resolved channel (\(m(\ell\nu jj)\)) or large-\(R\) jet in the boosted channel (\(m(\ell\nu J)\)). The background shape and normalization are obtained from MC simulation with dedicated control regions to constrain systematic uncertainties of the background modeling and normalization. The following control regions are used in the final fit:

* If the event satisfies all the selection criteria except the \(W/Z\)-boson mass-window cut with no b-jets (b-veto) then the event is categorized as a \(W\) control region event.

* If the event satisfies all the selection criteria and has additional b-jets then the event is categorized as a \(top\) control region event.

These regions are used to constrain the top and \(W\)+jets background normalization and shape uncertainties as described in Section 5.

The search is divided into two orthogonal categories to identify the \(\mathrm{ggF/q\bar{q}}\) and VBF production modes by identifying additional forward jets. If an event passes the VBF category selection for the additional forward jets (defined below) it is categorized as a VBF candidate event, otherwise as a \(\mathrm{ggF/q\bar{q}}\) candidate event. Events are then processed by a merged-jet selection then a two resolved-jet selection if they fail the merged selection. This prioritization strategy provides the optimum signal sensitivity as it favors the merged selection which contains less background contribution. A summary of the selection in the resonance search is presented in Table 2. The final distributions in the signal regions for the resonance search can be seen in Figure 2. The acceptance curves for the resonance search as function of VBF and (\(q\bar{q}\)) produced HVT \(W^{\prime}\) signal masses can be found in Figure 4.

#### 4.1.1 VBF Selection

Before any further selection, if an event contains two non-\(b\)-tagged small-\(R\) jets with \(\eta(J_{1}^{\mathrm{tag}})\cdot\eta(J_{2}^{\mathrm{tag}})<0\), a pseudorapidity separation of \(\Delta\eta=|\eta(J_{1}^{\mathrm{tag}})-\eta(J_{2}^{\mathrm{tag}})|>4.7\) and an invariant mass greater than 770 GeV, then the event is categorized as a VBF candidate event. If more than one such pairs of jets are found in the event, the one with the highest dijet invariant mass is chosen. These jets are not considered when searching for \(V\to qq\) candidates.

#### 4.1.2 Merged selection

In the merged selection, events are required to have at least one large-\(R\) jets with \(p_{\mathrm{T}}(J)>200\) GeV and \(|\eta(J)|<2\). If two or more large-\(R\) jets are found, the one with the highest \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) is chosen as a hadronically decaying \(W/Z\) boson candidate. A mass window cut of \(|m(J)-m(W/Z)|<50\) GeV is then applied and the selected events are then scaled by the expected efficiency of a \(W/Z\) boson tagger as described in Sec 3. If the selected large-\(R\) jet contains a \(b\)-quark within \(\Delta R<1\) around the jet, then the event is rejected to reduce contribution from \(t\bar{t}\) background.

Events are further required to pass the stricter \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\) cut of \(>100\) GeV and have \(p_{\mathrm{T}}(\ell\nu)>200\) GeV. If the lepton candidate is an electron, \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}/p_{\mathrm{T}}(\ell\nu)>0.2\) is required to reduce the multijet background contribution to a negligible level, as shown in the 13 TeV search [8]. Additional requirements that the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) of both hadronic and leptonic \(V\) candidates are greater than 40% (30%) of \(m(VV)\) for the \(\mathrm{ggF/q\bar{q}}\) (VBF) selection are also applied.

#### 4.1.3 Resolved selection

Events which fail the merged selection and have at least two small-\(R\) jets are then processed by the resolved selection. In the resolved selection, the hadronically decaying \(W/Z\) candidate is reconstructed from the pair of small-\(R\) jets with the mass \(m(jj)\) closest to the \(W/Z\) mass among all combinations of jets with \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>20\) GeV. This jet pairing strategy is chosen as it gives the best signal sensitivity. The leading (sub-leading) signal jet is further required to have \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>60(40)\) GeV after the jet pairs are selected to improve separation between the signal and the background. These signal jets are then required to be in either the \(W\) mass window of \(66<m(jj)<94\) or the \(Z\) mass window of \(82<m(jj)<106\). To suppress backgrounds containing top quarks, events are vetoed if they contain any \(b\)-tagged jets not part of the hadronic \(W/Z\)-boson candidate. In addition, if the dijet mass is within the W mass window and both jets are \(b\)-tagged, the event is removed. This cut is not applied to the \(Z\)-boson candidate in order to retain signal with \(Z\to bb\) decay.

The selected event is further required to fulfill the following angular conditions to enhance signal-like topology: \(\Delta\phi(j_{i},\ell)>1\), \(\Delta\phi(j_{i},\nu)>1\), \(\Delta\phi(j_{1},j_{2})<1\) and \(\Delta\phi(\ell,\nu)<1\). Furthermore, the leptonic \(W\) candidate is required to have \(p_{\rm T}(W)>\)7 GeV and if the lepton candidate is an electron there is an additional requirement of \(E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}/p_{\rm T}(\ell\nu)>0.2\). Similarly to the merged selection, both \(V\) candidates are required to have \(p_{\rm T}(\ell\nu/jj)/m(\ell\nu jj)>0.35\) (0.3) for the ggF/q\(\bar{\rm q}\) (VBF) selection.

### Vector boson scattering search

Experimentally, VBS is characterized by the presence of a pair of vector bosons (\(W\), \(Z\), or \(\gamma\)) and two forward jets with a large separation in pseudorapidity and a large dijet invariant mass. Therefore the VBS search is required to have 2 additional forward VBS-topology tagging jets in the event in addition to jets associated with the boson decay, similar to the resonant VBF search.

The VBS tagging jets are required to be non-\(b\)-tagged, in order to suppress the contribution of diagrams with a \(Wtb\) vertex (especially the electroweak \(t\bar{t}\) production) in the electroweak \(VVjj\) production. Tagging jets must be in the opposite hemispheres, \(\eta(J_{1}^{\rm tag})\cdot\eta(J_{2}^{\rm tag})<0\), and to have the highest dijet invariant mass among all pairs of jets remaining in the event after the \(V\to jj\) jet selection. This jet prioritization scheme is the reverse of the resonant VBF scheme and offers better background rejection in the \(p_{\rm T}\) regime of interest in the VBS search. After the tagging jet pair are selected, it is required that both tagging jets should have \(p_{\rm T}>\)30 GeV, in order to suppress the contribution from pile-up, and that the invariant mass of the two tagging jets system is greater than 400 GeV. In the VBS search the VBS-tagging jets are selected after the signal jets and are required to be \(\Delta R>1\) away from signal large-\(R\) jets.

To optimize the signal sensitivity, Boosted Decision Trees (BDT) for the resolved and merged searches were trained on the background and signal MC samples in the respective regions.Four variables are included in the merged BDT: the invariant mass of the \(lvJ\) system, the lepton \(\eta\), the second tag jet \(p_{T}\) and the boson centrality \(\zeta_{V}\). The boson centrality is defined as \(\zeta_{V}=min(\Delta\eta_{+},\Delta\eta_{-})\) where \(\Delta\eta_{+}=max(\eta(J_{1}^{\rm tag}),\eta(J_{2}^{\rm tag}))-max(\eta( \ell\nu),\eta(J))\) and \(\Delta\eta_{-}=min(\eta(\ell\nu),\eta(J))-min(\eta(J_{1}^{\rm tag}),\eta(J_{2} ^{\rm tag}))\). In the resolved BDT, eight variables were used: the invariant mass of the \(WVjj\) system, the lepton \(\eta\), the \(p_{T}\) of both VBS-tagging jets and sub-leading signal jet, the boson centrality defined similarly to above, the \(\Delta\eta\) between signal jets, and the \(\Delta R\) between the lepton and neutrino candidate. These variables were chosen as they are the minimal subset of variables with the greatest separation between the signal and background, that provide significant improvement when added during the training. The BDT were trained using a gradient descent BDT algorithm, maximizing the the Gini index, in the TMVA package [44]. The BDT are chosen as the discriminants and their distributions are used in the final fit for the VBS search. Similar to the resonance search, if any event fails either a mass-window cut or a \(b\)-veto but passes all other events then the event is categorized as a \(W\) or top control region. The normalized BDT response and the invariant mass distribution of the diboson pair are displayed in Figure 3 for the VBS search. A summary of the selection in the VBS search is presented in Table 3.

#### 4.2.1 Merged selection

In the merged selection, events are required to have at least one large-\(R\) jet with \(p_{\rm T}(J)>200\) GeV and \(|\eta(J)|<2\). From those candidate large-\(R\) jets, the one with the smallest \(|m(J)-m(W/Z)|\) is selected as the signal large-\(R\) jet. Mass window cuts and boson tagging efficiencies are applied in the same way as the resonance search.

To suppress backgrounds with top quarks, an event is rejected if any of the reconstructed jets outside the large R jet, is identified as containing a \(b\)-quark.

#### 4.2.2 Resolved selection

If events fail the merged VBS selection, the resolved selection is then applied. Signal jets are chosen in the same way as the resolved resonance search, except that the additional \(p_{T}\) requirements on the signal jets are not imposed. The signal jet pairs are then required to have \(|m(jj)-m(W/Z)|<15\) GeV. To suppress backgrounds with top quarks, an event is rejected if any of the reconstructed jets is identified as containing a \(b\)-quark.

## 5 Systematics

Two types of systematic uncertainties are considered in the analysis: experimental uncertainties associated with the detector response and calibration of reconstructed objects, and uncertainties on the background

## 6 Results

### Fit description

The results are extracted by performing a simultaneous binned maximum-likelihood fit to the \(m(WV)\) distributions (BDT for the VBS search) in the signal regions and the \(W\)+jets and \(t\bar{t}\) control regions. The \(WW\) and \(WZ\) channels for the resonance search are treated individually because they partially overlap. A test statistic based on the profile likelihood ratio [47] is used to test hypothesized values of the signal cross-section, separately for each model considered. The likelihood is defined as the product of the Poisson likelihoods for all signal and control regions for a given production mechanism category and channel. The fit includes five background contributions, corresponding to \(W\)+jets, \(t\bar{t}\), single-top, \(Z\)+jets, and diboson.

Systematic uncertainties are taken into account as constrained nuisance parameters with Gaussian or log-normal distributions. For each source of systematic uncertainty, the correlations across bins of \(m(WV)\) distributions and between different kinematic regions, as well as those between signal and background, are taken into account. The main background modelling systematics, namely the \(W\)+jets and \(t\bar{t}\) shape uncertainties, are constrained by the corresponding control regions and are treated as uncorrelated among the resolved and merged signal regions.

The number of bins and the bin widths in each signal region are optimized according to the expected background event distribution and detector resolution. In all regions, the overflow events are included in the last bin.

### Resonance search

For the resonance search, a statistical analysis is performed using the CLs [48] method to determine the expected upper limits that can be set on the signal cross section in the absence of signal. The expected upper limit set on the signal cross section is the greatest value of the signal cross-section that is not excluded with 95% confidence. This procedure is carried out for each signal mass.

The expected upper limits set on the signal cross section times branching ratio as a function of the signal mass are shown in Figure 5-6 for the \(\mathrm{ggF/q\bar{q}}\) and VBF categories at L =300 \(\mathrm{fb}^{-1}\) and L =3000 \(\mathrm{fb}^{-1}\) assuming pile-up conditions of 200 additional collisions per-crossing. A line showing the theoretical cross section for the HVT and Bulk Randall-Sundrum Graviton via \(\mathrm{ggF/q\bar{q}}\) production at each mass is overlayed and indicates the mass reach of the search.

For the HVT \(W^{\prime}\) and \(Z^{\prime}\) the limits are estimated to be 4.3 TeV with L =300 \(\mathrm{fb}^{-1}\) and and 4.9 TeV with L =3000 \(\mathrm{fb}^{-1}\) of \(pp\) collisions, using the same detector configuration and pileup conditions. For the Bulk graviton the expected limits are estimated as 2.8 and 3.3 TeV at L =300 \(\mathrm{fb}^{-1}\) and L =3000 \(\mathrm{fb}^{-1}\). The values at L =3000 \(\mathrm{fb}^{-1}\) show an expected increase to the sensitivity of the search to the benchmark signals by \(\sim\)1 TeV with respect to existing limits in this channel [8].

In the circumstance that HL-LHC sees an excess, the expected sensitivity can also be characterized. The discovery significance is defined as the luminosity required to see a 5\(\sigma\) effect of the signal. Here the signal significance is the quadratic sum of \(s/\sqrt{s+b}\), for each bin of the final discriminant distribution at that luminosity, \(s(b)\) representing the number of signal(background) events in the bin.

Figure 7 shows the expected discovery significance for the resonant search. In addition to the expected values, dashed curves shows the expected values for a future \(W/Z\)-tagger which has a 50% increase in signal efficiency and a further factor of 2 in background rejection. These values are representative of improvements seen in a recent diboson resonance search in the fully-hadronic \(VV\to qqqq\) analysis[49] by using track-caloclusters[49] as opposed to locally-calibrated topologically-clustered calorimeter jets. Other possible improvements in \(W/Z\)-tagging in the HL-LHC era can originate from usage of more advanced machine-learning techniques to discriminate against the background contribution and better understanding of jet substructure variables with measurements at higher integrated luminosities.

### VBS search

For the VBS search, the statistical analysis is done on the signal strength of the SM VBS (\(WW/WZ\rightarrow\ell\nu qq\)) processes.

The expected significance for the SM VBS process is 5.7\(\sigma\) at 300 fb\({}^{-1}\). The expected cross-section uncertainties are 18% at 300 fb\({}^{-1}\) and 6.5% at 3000 fb\({}^{-1}\). The effects of unfolding were not considered for the cross-section estimates.

Figure 5: 95% Upper limit for the HVT \(W^{\prime}\) (top left), HVT \(Z^{\prime}\) (top right), Scalar (bottom left), and Graviton (bottom right) via ggF/q\(\bar{\rm q}\) production.

Figure 6: 95% Upper limit for the HVT \(W^{\prime}\) (left), HVT \(Z^{\prime}\) (right) and VBF Scalar(bottom) via VBF production.

Figure 7: Expected luminosity required to observe a 5\(\sigma\) signal significance for the HVT \(W^{\prime}\) (black), HVT \(Z^{\prime}\) (blue) and \(G_{RS}\) (red). The solid curves shows the sensitivity using the current \(W/Z\)-tagger and the dashed curves for a future tagger that has a 50% increased signal efficiency and a factor 2 increased rejection of background.

If control regions are not used to constrain the systematics the expected significance is reduced to 3.6\(\sigma\) at 300 fb\({}^{-1}\). Likewise the cross-section uncertainty are increased to 28% at 300 fb\({}^{-1}\) and 10% at 3000 fb\({}^{-1}\) when control regions are ignored.

Fig 8 shows the expected signal sensitivity and cross-section uncertainty as a function of integrated luminosity. In addition to the \(\ell\nu qq\) channel, curves representing the estimated combined sensitivity including the other semi-leptonic channels, \(\ell\ell qq\) and \(\nu\nu qq\), are shown assuming they have equal sensitivity as the \(\ell\nu qq\) channel. Here actual \(p\)-value calculations were done in comparison to Fig 7.

## 7 Conclusion

The prospects of searches for new heavy resonances decaying to diboson (\(WW/WZ\)) and measurements of electroweak \(WW/WZ\) production via vector boson scattering in the semileptonic final states have been presented. The electroweak \(WW/WZ\) production in vector boson scattering processes is expected to be observed with a significance of more than 5 standard deviations at 300 fb\({}^{-1}\)and the expected cross-section measured to within 6.5% at 3000 fb\({}^{-1}\). The diboson resonance searches are interpreted for sensitivity to a heavy scalar singlet, a simplified phenomenological model with a heavy gauge boson and a Randall-Sundrum model with a spin-2 graviton. With 3000 fb\({}^{-1}\)of \(pp\) data, the mass limits for the new resonance is extended to 4.9 TeV for the HVT \(W^{\prime}/Z^{\prime}\), and 3.4 TeV for the Bulk Graviton.

Figure 8: a) Expected signal significance as a function of integrated luminosity up to 300 fb\({}^{-1}\). The solid black curve is the significance from the \(\ell\nu qq\) channel, while the black dashed curve shows the expected significance from all semi-leptonic channels assuming equal sensitivity. The grey dashed curve highlights the 5\(\sigma\) value. b) The expected cross-section uncertainty as function of integrated luminosity up to 3000 fb\({}^{-1}\). The solid black curve is the uncertainty from the \(\ell\nu qq\) channel, while the dashed curve shows the expected uncertainty from all semi-leptonic channels assuming equal sensitivity. The grey dashed curve highlights the values at 300 fb\({}^{-1}\) and 3000 fb\({}^{-1}\). The effects of unfolding are not considered.
