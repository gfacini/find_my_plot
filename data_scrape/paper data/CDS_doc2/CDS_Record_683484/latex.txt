The Atlas Collaboration, at the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN), proposes to build a general purpose proton-proton detector for the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), located in Geneva, Switzerland.

The ATLAS collaboration consists of approximately 100 international institutions (universities and research laboratories) with a worldwide distribution. The ATLAS detector includes a large scintillating tile calorimeter using iron as the absorber material. This detector will be used to identify and measure the by-products of proton-proton collisions that occur at the symmetric center. The design of this detector is unique in that the absorber plates are oriented perpendicular to the colliding beam axis, rather than parallel, as is done in most other similar detectors to date. A simplified view of the detector is shown in the figure below.

**Tile Calorimeter Description**

The Tile-Calorimeter consists of a cylinder constructed of steel plates that are trapezoidal in shape and formed into wedge shaped structures that are 2250 mm at their inner radius and 4200 mm at their outer radius. Each wedge module in the barrel is constructed of 5 or 6 approximately 1 meter long modules. The extended barrel consists of two, 1 meter long modules that form a similar cylinder that extends from each end of the barrel. The barrel cylinder is approximately 5990 mm long, and each of the extended barrel cylinders is approximately 2700 mm each. Each cell in the construction consists of two long trapezoidal plates 5 mm thick. A series of shorter plates 4 mm thick are staggered in between to form a checkerboard pattern when assembled. Each module is stacked with approximately 325 cells arrayed along the barrel axis. The total weight of the steel plates in the detector is approximately 2000 metric tons.

**Organization**

The U.S. participation in the Atlas Collaboration will require that some portion of the steel for the Tile-Calorimeter, and its subsequent fabrication into the appropriate shapes, plus the assembly into the prescribed modules be carried out by institutions in the U.S. At the present time the U.S. institutions responsible for this effort are, Argonne National Laboratory, the University of Chicago, the University of Illinois, Harvard University, Brandeis University, and Michigan State University.

**Technical Specifications**

This document will define the specifications that are required to provide the necessary steel for the construction previously described.

**Material Composition**

Ordinary low carbon hot rolled steel is normally acceptable to meet this requirement. This is defined in the U.S. as 1008/1010. The expected chemical composition for this steel can be defined as having the following ranges for the major constituents.

\begin{tabular}{l c} Maximum & Minimum \\ Carbon &.15 &.02 \\ Manganese &.90 &.30 \\ Phosphorus &.035 \\ Sulfur &.045 \\ \end{tabular}

**Dimensional Tolerances**

As a general rule, the thickness and surface finish on the plates can be defined as specified below. However, within a single plate the thickness should be confined to a much tighter tolerance, and the general surface finish required will be more than can normally be achieved in hot rolled plate. In order to achieve these tolerances it may be necessary to provide a secondary cold reduction pass, or passes, after the plates have been pickled and annealed. It should be understood however, that cold reduction is not necessary if the specified tolerances can be achieved with standard hot rolled pickled and annealed sheet.

**The overall tolerances for the entire lot of plates required are:**

\[\begin{array}{ccc}&4\,\mathrm{mm}\,\mathrm{Plate}&5\,\mathrm{mm}\,\mathrm{Plate }\\ \hline\mathrm{Thickness}&\pm\,.004\,\mathrm{in.}\,\left(.1\,\mathrm{mm}\right)& \pm\,.004\,\mathrm{in.}\,\left(.1\,\mathrm{mm}\right)\\ \hline\mathrm{Flatness}&\mathrm{Maximum}\,\mathrm{deviation}\,\mathrm{from}\, \mathrm{horizontal}\,\mathrm{when}\,\mathrm{plate}\,\mathrm{is}\,\mathrm{supported}\, \mathrm{on}\,\mathrm{a}\,\mathrm{flat}\,\mathrm{surface}\,=\,1/32\\ &\mathrm{inches}\,\left(.75\,\mathrm{mm}\right)\,\mathrm{single}\,\mathrm{node} \,\mathrm{Surface}\,\mathrm{Finish}&20\,\mathrm{-40}\,\mathrm{micro}\,\mathrm{inches}\,\mathrm{RMS}\\ \hline\end{array}\]
**The single plate tolerances required**

\[\begin{array}{ccc}&4\,\mathrm{mm}\,\mathrm{Plate}&5\,\mathrm{mm}\,\mathrm{ Plate}\\ \hline\mathrm{Thickness}&\pm\,.001\,\mathrm{in.}\,\left(.03\,\mathrm{mm}\right)& \pm\,.001\,\mathrm{in.}\,\left(.03\,\mathrm{mm}\right)\\ \hline\end{array}\]
**Quantity Required**

**The finished plates are trapezoidal in shape and will be cut from raw stock before stamping. These plates are shown in Fig. 1 in outline only. It is expected that the steel supplier will optimize the cutting of the rough**plates to minimize waste. The total number of plates required are as follows:

\begin{tabular}{l c} Master Plates &... & 81,024 \\ Spacer \#1 &... & 40,320 \\ Spacer \#2 &... & 40,512 \\ Spacer \#3 &... & 40,320 \\ Spacer \#4 &... & 40,512 \\ Spacer \#5 &... & 40,320 \\ Spacer \#6 &... & 40,512 \\ Spacer \#7 &... & 40,320 \\ Spacer \#8 &... & 40,512 \\ Spacer \#9 &... & 40,320 \\ Spacer \#10 &... & 40,512 \\ Spacer \#11 &... & 40,320 \\ \end{tabular}

The total weight of the master plates is approximately 1430 metric tons.

The total weight of the spacer plates is approximately 574 metric tons.

Some number of master plates will be used in the assembly to adjust for buildup and reduction in the stack height. These plates will most likely be 6 mm and 4 mm in thicknesses. It may be necessary to produce these plates with a secondary finishing operation, such as grinding.

**Handling and Stacking**

It is likely that there will be systematic thickness variations in the plate width after rolling, such as crown or taper, the plates should be turned and stacked to minimize the out of parallelism resulting from these variations after shearing from original coil. This stacking sequence should be maintained throughout the handling process and should be shipped to the stamping fabricator in this orientation.

**Shipping and Storage**

Since it will be necessary to store the raw plates for some unspecified length of time, all plates should be oiled prior to shipment to prevent oxidation.
