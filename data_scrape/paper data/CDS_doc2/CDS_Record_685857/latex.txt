**A logical staging scenario for the ATLAS inner detector**

Torsten Akesson

**1. Introduction**

Outer constraints on the proposed ATLAS experiment will probably force us to stage as many parts of the detector as possible. Probably no parts of ATLAS will escape this, including the inner detector.

One may ask what performance that ought to be staged, and the answer is \(\Delta\)p/p since low mass is probed at the initial stage and high mass when the machine is running at its highest luminosity and energy. Rapidity coverage should not be staged since low mass is distributed over a larger rapidity range, and neither should electron identification be staged since the best electron identification is required at the lowest p\({}_{\rm T}\)-values.

Secondary vortexing is another performance that for obvious reasons should be operational from the initial stage.

An important feature of a first inner detector phase is to minimize the number of different technologies, and to choose tho ones that are closest in time to be realized in large scale.

**2. Staging scenario**

From the introductory arguments it is rather clear that a first phase of the inner detector should consist of the SiTV and the comploto TRD/T, and only that. This first inner detector phase would have the same performance as the complete inner detector in the LoI, except for: i) The momentum resolution would be 30-40% worse; ii) The axial z-matching, in 1\(\eta\)!1\(\leq\)1, of em-shower/charged particle would be given by the SiTV alone. However,this latter point can probably be enhanced quite easily by introducing small angle stereo on some of the straws, or by a dedicated z-layer at the face of the calorimeter.

This scenario is a staging in Ap/p and only that. It is in addition using the most tested, prototyped, radiation resistant and robust technology for the outer tracker.

A detailed comparison between this initial phase and the complete inner detector is listed below:Electron identification after 10\({}^{3}\) selection of calorimeter

## 3 Recuperating the electrons in a down staged em-calorimeter

It has been proposed to stage the calorimeter by waiting with the em-calorimeter in the end-cap region. This would,of course, strongly degrade the calorimeter electron selection in this region and degrade the electron energy measurement. However, the onorgy measurement is somewhat compensated by the higher electron energy at large rapidities.

It is probably reasonable to guess that such a degradation of the end-capcalorimeter would worsen the calorimeter jet rejection from \(10^{3}\) to maybe \(10^{1}\). Such a degradation would be a disaster for detection of H\({}^{0}\)\(\rightarrow\)Z\({}^{0}\)Z\({}^{0}\)\({}^{*}\) if the jet rejection is not recuperated by another device.

The TRD/T in the proposed staging scenario has good jet rejection performance at large rapidities, and would certainly give a factor of \(\sim 10^{3}\), giving a total calorimeter+inner detector jet rejection of \(10^{4}\), which is enough for the required electron detection in the H\({}^{0}\) search. In addition one could recuperate some of the calorimeter energy isolation by charged particle isolation measured in the inner detector.

## 4 Required alignment of the TRD/T

The momentum resolution in the proposed phase-1 is based on that the TRD/T can be treated as a superlayer. The position of the individual straws has to be known to a precision so that they do not degrade the drift time resolution of \(\sim\)150 \(\mu\)m for this to work, i.e. a precision in the order of 100 \(\mu\)m. This is certainly achievable.

In addition one has to know the global position of azimuthal segments of the TRD/T, with respect to the outer layer of the SiTV and the interaction point to within 50-60 \(\mu\)m. This alignment would be done with straight tracks (B=0), for example using muons selected by the toroid detector. After this has been done, one has to monitor the azimuthal positions of the TRD/T inner and outer frames.

This alignment scheme is reasonable.

Please note that the individual straw-positions has NOT to be known with this high precision.

## 5 Later phases

As the luminosity is increased, and maybe also the energy if the LHC is energy staged, one would at some point require a better momentum resolution.This is equivalent of getting a bottor spatial measurement of the charged track at an as large radius as possible. It is therefore important that a TRD/T is constructed so that this can be accomodated.

## 6 Summary

A staging of the inner detector ought to be in \(\Delta\)p/p, and a phase-1 including SiTV and TRD/T alone would be the logical way to do it. This would in addition compensate some of the loss in calorimeter electron identification in the end-cap, if its em-calorimeter is not installed at the initial stage.

Such a first phase would be 32 MCHF cheaper than the complete inner detector in the LoI.
