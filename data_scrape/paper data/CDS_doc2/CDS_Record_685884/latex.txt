Overall performance criteria

### Momentum resolution

This should be studied using the full detector, and also with barrel layers up to and including 30 cm removed to check the robustness. This can also be considered as an extreme case of loss of efficiency in the barrel SCT. We know that neither layout can reach the performance spec in the forward region if the forward SCT disks are removed - this is the reason that they are forseen to be rad hard.

Connected to the momentum resolution is the robustness of the straw measurement with drift time, which is required for the nominal 60 micron precision of the large radius R\(\phi\) measurement.

### Pattern recognition

Pattern recognition in both projections, with good track matching between projections, and between different regions of the tracker, is essential. Studies of relatively simple test cases should be sufficient for the layout comparison.

### High rate operation of straws

The Panel design places a greater reliance on the straws, not only for momentum resolution, but probably also at the level of hits for triggering. The case of loss of performance of the innermost part of the TRT due to high rate should be considered.

### L2 trigger

The level 2 trigger ability of the tracker must be maintained, including the barrel/forward transition region.

## 3 Engineering criteria

Any proposed layout must be realistic from the mechanical point of view. The demands on the engineering are severe, and in this category one must consider the following points:

* Structural engineering within the design tolerances
* Ability to align and monitor stability during operation
* Ease of installation and access. Provision of service paths.
* Ability to cool detectors and electronics
* Ability to achieve all the above with minimal material, especially near the beam pipe.
* Lack of interference between detectors, including electronic cross talk.

Given the difficulty of the mechanical task, a premium must be placed on simple solutions over complex ones, and the solutions should be possible without invoking untried technologies (even though new technologies could be used if sufficiently proven at construction time).

## 4 Special considerations in the barrel region

### z measurement

A solution must be found which meets the agreed specification for the z measurement.

### Survival of the silicon

The expected lifetime of the barrel SCT layers, the robustness of the tracker if layers fail, and the feasibility of replacement of layers must be considered.

## 5 Special considerations in the forward region

### Performance of the forward precision layers

The forward precision layers (forward SCT disks and MSGC's) must contribute both to the pattern recognition and to the level two trigger. The relative performance of the layouts should be compared.

Cost considerations

Overall, a layout which meets the specifications with a lower cost is preferable. In many cases it will be impossible to agree on absolute costings. However, comparisons of substrate area, numbers of electronics channels, cooling load and general complexity should provide a guide to which layout is likely to be the cheapest in real life.

## 7 Areas which do NOT affect the decision

The following areas are all important to the overall tracker performance, but are not relevant to the comparison of the Coseners and Panel layouts, since they can be implemented flexibly in either concept:

* Layout of the vertexing layers.
* Choice of pixels or strips for small radius.
* Exact position of the forward SCT disks.
* Exact number of MSGC planes in the forward region.
* Exact positions of SCT layers in the barrel. (the above points assume that 5 precision points per track is maintained.)
* Electron identification studies with large samples of jets.
* Gamma identification.
