New Features

Both the geometry and digitization routines have been modified in order to describe the real setup more precisely.

### Geometry

Each module is described as a set of submodules with the dimensions specified according to the respective drawings. This approach allows the introduction of the air gaps between the submodules. The submodules are made of periods, which consist of iron master and spacer plates, scintillating tiles and glue and paint layers. The thickness of the glue and paint layers is determined for each type of submodule separately (using the target submodule height and thicknesses of master and spacer plates). Moreover, the ITC modules are involved in the production extended barrel modules geometry description.

The barrel module 0 and production modules are described separately due to the differences taken into account:

* different thicknesses of absorber plates: the respective values are set according to the measurements presented in Refs. [2, 3].
* different number of periods (305 in barrel module 0, while 307 periods in production barrel module).

### Digitization

The readout cells are defined according to the final fibre routing (see Ref. [4] for barrel module 0). Moreover, the signals from separate photomultipliers are implemented, taking into account the following features:

* Simple parametrization of the tile profile (so called U-shape, i.e. the dependence of the response on the energy deposition \(y\)-coordinate) is involved. Each photomultiplier response is represented by an exponential function depending on the \(y\)-coordinate of the energy deposition. The parameters of these exponentials are set to fit the data presented in Ref. [5].
* the Poisson fluctuation on the photocathode is included (the overall photoelectron statistics \(N_{\mathrm{p.e.}}=40\) p.e./GeV per cell is used).

Other features (Cs-tubes, plug scintillators E1 - E4) are not yet involved, but will be added in next version.

## 3 Installation and Running

The script *davidek/public/tbsim/til0sim is provided to simplify the installation procedure. Run this script and enter the desired directory, where the software should be installed (default directory is testbsim). The script then creates two subdirectories (batch for non-interactive processing and int

- energy in absorbers (masters, spacers, glue, paint, ITC special master plate) * e_tbma(2)
- energy in girder * e_tbma(3)
- energy in end-plate * e_tbma(4)
- energy in front-plate
* Variables e_tdm(1:6) and e_toma(1:4) describe the same quantities in barrel module 0.
* energy in separate "Prague paddles"
- scintillators used in the back muon wall. The energy is corrected for the Y-profile as well.
* egen,etagen,phigen-energy, \(\eta\) and \(\varphi\) of the generated particle. **Note that in simulation \(\eta\) has opposite sign** than that used in experiment. i.e. here \(\eta>0\) implies \(z>0\) (which is the "Saleve side", if the table is in position \(\eta=0\))
* momentum and vertex position of the generated particle (can be used for impact point calculation)

Then follows the information from separate cells. The first index always varies between 1 and 2, which correspond to PM-up and PM-down respectively.

* samp1(1:2,1:5) - cells in EB at \(-z\) side, i.e cells A16 to A12
* samp1(1:2,7:26) - cells in barrel production module A10 to A-10
* samp1(1:2,28:32) - cells in EB at \(+z\) side, i.e cells A-12 to A-16
* cells in second sampling of the production modules:

* samp2(1:2,6) - cell C10 in EB \(-z\) side

* s2m0(1:2,1:18) - cells BC9 to BC-9
* s3m0(1:2,1:7) - cells D3 to D-3
Test With Electrons

The presented code has been tested with 100 GeV electrons entering the production barrel module at \(\eta=0.35,\varphi=0\). In each of the 10 studied impact points along the \(z\)-axis, 6000 electrons were shot into the calorimeter. The same test was performed with the old version (corresponds to the September 1998 beam test setup) at exactly same conditions.

The results are shown in Fig. 2. The circles represent the mean signal (obtained as a Gaussian fit) from the scintillating tiles of the central module. Both the new version (full circles) and the old one (open circles) exhibit a clear signal dependence on the impact point within the period. A simple periodic function was chosen to parametrize the mentioned dependence

\[<E>=P1\times\left(1+P\,2\times\sin\left(2\pi\frac{z_{\it{imp}}}{z_{\it{per}}}+P \,3\right)\right) \tag{1}\]

The quantity \(z_{\it{per}}\) stands for the period thickness (it amounts to 18.23 mm for the production barrel standard submodules, while in the old MC version it is set to 18.00 mm). The parameters \(P1,P2,P3\) are obtained by fitting the dependence with the formula (1). While \(P3\) is a phase factor only, the parameter \(P1\) represents the average response to 100 GeV electrons1 and \(P2\) is the oscillation amplitude.

Footnote 1: The expression 100 /P1 is then the calibration constant relating the energy loss in the active part to the total energy.

The average response to electrons is slightly smaller in the new version than in the old one. This effect is due to different period thickness, which is caused by the introduction of glue and paint layers in the new version. The oscillation amplitude is approximately same in both versions and amounts to 5%.
