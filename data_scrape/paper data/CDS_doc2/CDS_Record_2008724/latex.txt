**ATLAS Inner Detector Alignment Performance with February 2015 Cosmic Ray Data**

The ATLAS Collaboration

The results of the first alignment of the ATLAS inner detector after the insertion of the new insertable B-Layer, installed during the first long shutdown, are presented. These results were obtained by using cosmic-ray data collected in February 2015. Different alignment techniques have been used to improve the description of the detector geometry. After the alignment, biases in the track-to-hit residuals in cosmic-ray data events have been corrected and the resolution of the active modules has been improved. The IBL global position has been determined at micron level with an averaged module resolution of 32 \(\mu\)m along the most sensitive direction of the module. The resolutions of track parameters have been studied by splitting reconstructed tracks into two subtracks in the upper and lower parts of the inner detector.

## 1 Introduction

ATLAS [1] is a general purpose experiment at CERN's Large Hadron Collider (LHC). During Run I, precise measurements of Standard Model processes and searches for new physics phenomena have been performed by the ATLAS Collaboration. Charged particle trajectories are reconstructed in ATLAS by the inner detector (ID) tracking system [2], that is one of four detector systems besides the Calorimeters, the Muon Spectrometers, and the forward detectors [1]. The latter three detector components are not discussed further due to being outside of the scope of this note. The precision of the measurement of the parameters of the charged particle trajectories is limited by a combination of the intrinsic sensitive devices resolution, the knowledge of the magnetic field, material distribution, and location of the detector elements. The purpose of the ID alignment is the precise determination of the positions of the sensitive devices as well as their geometrical distortions relative to the ideal simulated geometry. At the end of Run I, the positions of the individual active detector modules in all three ID subsystems (Pixel, SCT, and TRT) were aligned to better than 1\(\mu\)m [3].

During the first long shutdown (LS1), a number of upgrades have been performed for the ATLAS ID. The Pixel detector was extracted, refurbished, and the Insertable B-Layer (IBL) [4] was added as a new innermost tracking layer closest to the beam pipe. These changes to the ID caused its components to move with respect to their positions at the end of Run I. After reinstallation, the position of the Pixel detector is expected to be within 100 \(\mu\)m of the original location, due to the intrinsic precision of the Pixel mounts system inside the Pixel support tube (PST). The PST was not removed during LS1. In this context, the positions of the previously installed three Pixel layers are also known with good precision. This is in contrast to the IBL, where the initial position is known from survey data only with lower accuracy than required for precision tracking. The SCT and TRT have not been removed during LS1. In order to confirm the positions of all previously installed ID systems and to determine the position of the IBL in preparation for Run II, a track-based alignment [3; 5] is performed, exploiting cosmic-ray events recorded with the ATLAS detector. The TRT position is used as a reference during the alignment corrections.

This note is organised as follows. Section 2 provides a brief description of the ID. Section 3 describes the alignment procedure. Track selection requirements for alignment are discussed in section 4. The performance of the ID alignment is shown in section 5. Conclusions are discussed in section 6.

## 2 ATLAS inner detector

### Inner detector structure

In Run II, the ATLAS inner detector [2] consists of three subdetectors, the Pixel detector (including IBL), the Semiconductor Tracker (SCT), and Transition Radiation Tracker (TRT), all embedded in a 2T axial magnetic field and designed to reconstruct charged particles within a pseudorapidity range of \(|\eta|<2.5\) (see Tab. 1 for technical details and Fig. 1 for a schematic view of the barrel region). The Pixel detector consists of 1744 silicon pixel modules arranged in three barrel layers and two end caps with three disks each. The expected hit (detector measurement) resolution is 10 \(\mu\)m in \(r\)-\(\phi\) and 115 \(\mu\)m in \(z\). The IBL has been added as an additional layer to the Pixel detector, reducing the distance from the interaction point to the first tracking layer. It consists of 280 silicon pixel modules arranged on 14 azimuthal carbon fiber staves surrounding the beam pipe at a mean radius of 33.2 mm. Each stave is instrumented with 12 two-chip planar modules, covering the region of \(|\eta|<2.7\), and 8 single chip modules with 3D sensors,four at each end of the stave (\(2.7<|\eta|<3\)). The expected hit resolution is \(\sim 8\)\(\mu\)m in \(r\)-\(\phi\) and \(\sim 40\)\(\mu\)m in \(z\)[4]. In order to accommodate the IBL, the beam pipe inside the ATLAS detector has been exchanged, reducing the radius of the pipe envelope to 2.83 cm [4]. In order to simplify the notation throughout the remainder of the note, the term Pixel will be used to refer only to the 50x400 \(\mu\)m pixels and IBL to the new layer. The SCT consists of 4088 silicon strip modules, arranged in four barrel layers and two end caps with nine wheels each. The intrinsic resolution is \(\sim 17\)\(\mu\)m and \(\sim 580\)\(\mu\)m in \(r\)-\(\phi\) and \(z\), respectively. The TRT is the outermost of the ID subdetectors and is made of 350848 gas-filled straw tubes with a single hit resolution of \(\sim 130\)\(\mu\)m along \(r\)-\(\phi\).

### Global coordinate system

The ATLAS reference frame is a right-handed Cartesian coordinate system, where the origin is at the nominal \(p\)-\(p\) interaction point, corresponding to the centre of the detector. The positive \(x\)-axis points to the centre of the LHC ring, the positive \(y\)-axis points upwards and the positive \(z\)-axis points along the beam direction. The global coordinate system is illustrated in Fig. 2 (left). Cylindrical coordinates \(r\) and \(\phi\) are often used in the transverse plane (\(x\)-\(y\)).

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{l c c c} \hline \hline Subdetector & Element size & Intrinsic resolution [\(\mu\)m] & Radius barrel layers [mm] \\ \hline IBL & 50 \(\mu\)m\(\times\)250 \(\mu\)m & 8\(\times\)40 & 33.2 \\ Pixel & 50 \(\mu\)m\(\times\)400 \(\mu\)m & 10\(\times\)115 & 50.5, 88.5, 122.5 \\ SCT & 80 \(\mu\)m & 17 & 299, 371, 443, 514 \\ TRT & 4 mm & 130 & from 554 to 1082 \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 1: Summary of the main characteristics of the ID subdetectors. The intrinsic resolution of the IBL and the Pixel is reported along \(r\)–\(\phi\) and \(z\), while for SCT and TRT is only along \(r\)–\(\phi\). For SCT and TRT the element sizes refers to the spacing of the readout strips and the diameter of the straw tubes, respectively.

### Local coordinate system

The reference frame describing the position and orientation of individual detector modules of the ID is a right-handed reference frame \((x^{\prime},y^{\prime},z^{\prime})\) with the origin in the geometrical centre of each device. The local coordinate system is illustrated in Fig. 2 (right). The \(x^{\prime}\)-axis points along the most sensitive direction of the module. This corresponds to the shorter pitch side for Pixel and IBL modules, and perpendicular to the strip-orientation for the SCT. In case of the TRT, the \(x^{\prime}\)-axis is perpendicular to both the TRT wire and the radial direction, which is defined from the origin of the global frame to the straw centre. In the silicon detectors, the \(y^{\prime}\)-axis is oriented along the long side of the module while the \(z^{\prime}\)-direction is orthogonal to the \((x^{\prime}-y^{\prime})\) plane. Hits are reconstructed in the local reference frame. As the SCT consists of double sided modules, a separate local frame is associated on each of the modules sides. The resulting hit position is extracted by combining these two local coordinates. The TRT measures the radial distance of the tracks from the wire as \(\sqrt{x^{\prime 2}+z^{\prime 2}}\).

## 3 Alignment of the ATLAS inner detector

### Inner detector alignment procedure

The inner detector is composed of a large number of active detector modules (see Sec. 2.1 for details). Each module or grouped collection of modules, e.g. a subdetector, can be treated as an alignable structure. When considered as a rigid body, each structure has six degrees of freedom (DOF) that define uniquely its position and orientation in space. The DOFs correspond to three translations \((T_{x},T_{y},T_{z})\) and three rotations \((R_{x},R_{y},R_{z})\). Translations are with respect to the origin of the reference frame and rotations around the Cartesian axes. The DOFs will be referred to as the _alignment parameters_ (\(\mathbf{a}\)).

The alignment is performed at different hierarchical levels following the assembly structure of the ID. Starting with the largest physical structures at level 1, the detector subsystems are aligned separating into end-caps and barrel regions in order to correct for collective movements. Level 2 treats individual

Figure 2: Left: Schematic representation of the longitudinal plane of the inner detector showing the Pixel and IBL (innermost layers, blue), the SCT (middle detection layer, green) and the TRT (outermost layers, red). The global system of coordinates is shown with the origin at the centre of the detector. Right: Local system of coordinates on the corresponding devices.

barrel layers and end-cap disks as physical structures (barrel modules and end-cap wheels in case of the TRT). Level 3 corresponds to a silicon module and TRT wire level alignment. The levels are addressed consecutively during the alignment procedure.

In preparation for Run II, the alignment levels have been updated in order to accommodate the IBL. These changes are straightforward for the higher levels 2 and 3, as the IBL represents merely an additional Pixel layer or additional silicon modules, respectively. At level 1, the IBL is treated as one separate physical structure with respect to the previously installed Pixel subdetector, owing to its mechanically independent support structure. Consequently, it is not expected that the IBL movement is correlated with the collective movements of the remaining Pixel detector.

In this work, the alignment is performed with cosmic-ray events taken during commissioning for Run II. Cosmic-ray data comprise predominantly events passing through the detector from top to bottom and therefore do not provide a uniform illumination of all ID modules. Lower numbers of hits are recorded in end-cap modules and barrel modules located on either side. Depending on the alignment level, some DOFs may be fixed during the alignment procedure. For example the relative position of an alignable structure is not allowed to be changed, or a specific DOF for an alignable structure may be fixed due to a low number of hits-on-track and an expected poor resolution with respect to this direction. In Tab. 2 are reported the details of the alignment levels used during Run II cosmic-ray data commissioning. \(T_{z}\) was fixed for the SCT barrel due to the comparably low resolution of the SCT strips along the local \(y^{\prime}\) direction. Since the SCT has been aligned only up to level 2, the resolution of the SCT modules after the alignment is expected to be worse compared to the intrinsic resolution due to residual misalignment. The TRT detector was kept fixed as a reference for all alignment levels used during Run II cosmic-ray data commissioning.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{l|l|c|l} \hline \hline Level & Description & Structures & DOF \\ \hline
1 & IBL & 1 & All except \(R_{x}\) \\  & Pixel detector & 1 & All except \(R_{x}\) \\  & SCT barrel (end-caps fixed) & 1 & \(T_{x},R_{y},R_{z}\) \\ \hline

\end{table}

### Method

The helical trajectories of tracks are parameterised by \(\tau=(d_{0},z_{0},\phi_{0},\theta,q/p)\), where \(d_{0}\) is the transverse impact parameter, \(z_{0}\) the longitudinal impact parameter, \(\phi_{0}\) and \(\theta\) the azimuthal and polar angle of the track at the perigee, defined as the point of closest approach to the reference frame \(z\)-axis. The ratio \(q/p\) is the inverse of the particle momentum (\(p\)) multiplied by its charge (\(q\)) (see Ref. [3] for more details). The hits (detector measurements) left in the detector by charged particles traversing active detector elements are used to reconstruct their trajectories by performing a fit to the kinematic parameters. The track-to-hit residuals \(\mathbf{r}\) are defined as

\[\mathbf{r}(\mathbf{\tau})=\mathbf{m}-\mathbf{e}\,, \tag{1}\]

where \(\mathbf{r}\) represents the residual vector of the measurements of a track, \(\mathbf{m}\) is the vector of measurements of this track in the different sensors and \(\mathbf{e}\) is the vector of their expected values according to the test track parameters \(\tau\). For the purpose of performance studies (see Sec. 5), the so-called _unbiased_ residual distributions are used. Residuals are defined as unbiased, when the hits on a certain subdetector module are removed from the track fit before computing the track-to-hit residual. The track fitting consists of finding the set of track parameters which minimizes the \(\chi^{2}\),

\[\chi^{2}(\mathbf{\tau})=\mathbf{r}^{\mathsf{T}}V^{-1}\mathbf{r}\,, \tag{2}\]

where \(V\) is the covariance matrix of the detector measurements [6]. The track-based alignment of the ID is an extension to the general track reconstruction in Eq. 2 used in the ID. Here, \(\mathbf{r}(\mathbf{\tau})\) is extended to be implicitly dependent on the alignment parameters \(\mathbf{a}\) (\(\mathbf{r}(\mathbf{\tau},\mathbf{a})\)). Collecting a large number of events (tracks), the \(\chi^{2}(\mathbf{r}(\mathbf{\tau},\mathbf{a}))\) is minimal when detector elements are at their respective true positions. Further details on ID track parameter estimation are given in Ref. [6] and discussions on the alignment specific extension of the method can be found in Refs [3, 5].

### Alignment validation and error scaling

As described above, the alignment process relies on the minimisation of the track-to-hit residuals. In order to determine the achieved precision of the alignment procedure and to validate its results unbiased residual distributions are reported. In absence of any misalignment the residual distributions are centred at zero, with an associated width representing the uncertainty on a hit position. For this ideal case, the resulting track-to-hit pull1 distributions are Gaussian distributions with a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one. Due to module misalignment, the width of the pulls may differ from one. The determination of the optimal hit error scaling is an iterative procedure that corrects the errors associated to an hit with the following parametrisation:

Footnote 1: The pull is defined for the distribution of a variable \(x\) with mean \(\mu\) and width \(\sigma\) as \((x-\mu)/\sigma\).

\[\sigma=a\cdot\sigma_{0}\oplus b\,, \tag{3}\]

where \(\sigma_{0}\) represents the intrinsic hit error, \(a\) a scaling term to correct \(\sigma_{0}\), and \(b\) a constant term parametrising the unknown residual misalignment. The parameters of the error scaling are defined for eachsubdetector and active element measurement direction, separately for barrel and end caps (24 error scaling parameters in total). The error scaling can be reduced with a more precise level of alignment. Typical values for term \(b\) are on the order of \(\sim 100\,\mu\)m before alignment and can be reduced to be as small as the intrinsic resolution of each respective subdetector component. A scaling term of \(a=1\) is used in both cases.

## 4 Data samples and track selection criteria

### Alignment data

During 2014 and the beginning of 2015, cosmic-ray data were collected using the ATLAS detector in order to commission all detector systems in preparation for Run II data-taking. Data collected in February 2015 have been used to perform the first alignment of the ID after the LS1.

The collected cosmic-ray data include \(\sim 3\times 10^{5}\) ID tracks, which are used for alignment. The data were taken in a configuration with the toroid field off and solenoid field on. After the track selection requirements (see Sec. 4.2), \(\sim\)50000 tracks were used in alignment.

### Track selection

Cosmic-ray events in ATLAS correspond to atmospheric muons that are created in cosmic ray interactions in the Earth's atmosphere. The trigger for cosmic-ray events is a fast hardware-based logical OR of the TRT wires having a hit along a likely muon track path with an efficiency over 90% [7] and an average rate of 4.84 Hz. Such muon tracks triggering the ATLAS detector have been selected for the studies presented in this note. Tracks are required to be ID tracks that include measurements from all ID subdetectors. The tracks used for the alignment procedure are required to pass a series of quality cuts, which are optimised for the topology of vertically passing cosmic-ray muon tracks.

* \(N^{\rm Pixel}\geq 1\): at least one hit in the Pixel detector.
* \(N^{\rm SCT}\geq 8\): at least eight hits in the SCT detector.
* \(N^{\rm SCT}_{\rm top}+N^{\rm Pixel}_{\rm top}\geq 2\) and \(N^{\rm SCT}_{\rm bottom}+N^{\rm Pixel}_{\rm bottom}\geq 2\): at least two hits both in the top and bottom half shells of the silicon detector.
* \(N^{\rm TRT}\geq 25\): at least twenty five hits in the TRT
* \(p^{\rm Track}_{T}\geq 2\) GeV

The \(p^{\rm Track}_{T}\geq 2\) GeV is applied in order to reduce the impact of multiple scattering in the traversed material. The resulting distributions of the track parameters for tracks passing the alignment selection are shown in Fig. 3. The distribution of the signed track transverse momentum (\(q\cdot p_{T}\)) is shown on the top-left of Fig. 3, the longitudinal impact parameter \(z_{0}\) on the top-right, the pseudorapidity \(\eta\) on the bottom-left, and the track azimuthal (\(\phi_{0}\)) angle bottom-right. The double-peak structure at \(\eta\approx-0.4\) and \(\eta\approx 0.3\) is due to the construction shafts through which the ATLAS detector components were lowered into the cavern. The asymmetry in the \(q\,p_{T}\) distribution is due to a higher flux of atmospheric \(\mu^{+}\) than \(\mu^{-}\), owing to the predominantly positively charged primary cosmic ray spectrum. The \(\phi_{0}\) distribution reflects the down-going flux of atmospheric muon events. The nearly flat distribution in \(z_{0}\) shows that cosmic-ray data consists of through-going muon tracks, and thus are not confined to a small central region as collision events. The sharp drop in the number of tracks in \(z_{0}\) at \(\pm 400\,\mathrm{mm}\) corresponds to the edges of the Pixel barrel.

## 5 Results of the alignment with cosmic ray events

The minimization of the track-to-hit residuals, denoted by \(\mathbf{r}\) (see Sec. 3.2), is the basis of the track-based alignment. In Sec. 5.1, residuals in data before and after alignment with cosmic-ray events recorded by ATLAS in February 2015 are compared (see Tab. 2 for details on alignment steps). The improvement between before and after alignment is quantified in terms of the Full Width Half Maximum (FWHM) of the distributions. In order to quantify the increase in precision in the determination of the track parameters, the selected tracks have been split into two half-tracks. The difference of reconstructed track parameters for both half-tracks (upper and lower track segments) are compared before and after alignment in Sec. 5.2.

Figure 3: Track parameters for tracks passing the alignment selection (pre-alignment) using cosmic-ray data collected in February 2015. The distribution of the charge signed track transverse momentum (\(p_{T}\)) is shown on the top-left, the longitudinal impact parameter \(z_{0}\) on the top-right, the pseudorapidity \(\eta\) on the bottom-left, and the track azimuthal (\(\phi_{0}\)) angle at the bottom-right.

### Track-to-hit residuals in cosmic-ray data

The local \(x^{\prime}\) (left) and local \(y^{\prime}\) (right) unbiased residual distributions for all hits-on-track in the Pixel barrel and in the IBL are shown in Fig. 4 and 5. A misalignment of 40 (28) \(\mu\)m in the \(x^{\prime}\) (\(y^{\prime}\)) direction of the IBL is corrected, with the FWHM\(/2.35\) being reduced from 197 (153) \(\mu\)m to 32 (97) \(\mu\)m, respectively. Similarly, a bias of 30 (-1) \(\mu\)m in the Pixel barrel local \(x^{\prime}\) and local \(y^{\prime}\) direction has been corrected. The width of the distribution has been reduced from 68 (167) \(\mu\)m to 28 (156) \(\mu\)m in \(x^{\prime}\) and \(y^{\prime}\), respectively. The residual mean of the SCT is corrected by 46 \(\mu\)m to a final value of 1\(\mu\)m. Additionally, the FWHM\(/2.35\) is reduced from 115 \(\mu\)m to 83 \(\mu\)m. This value is far from the SCT intrinsic resolution because SCT alignment still needs to be refined by using higher alignment levelsline. Distributions for end-caps of all subdetectors are not shown as cosmic-ray events do not provide high enough statistics and incident angles within end-caps are very large.

Fig. 6 shows the mean of the local \(x^{\prime}\) (left) and local \(y^{\prime}\) (right) residual distributions as a function the module location along the stave (\(\eta\)-index). This distribution is integrated over all 14 IBL staves. The

The distributions are integrated over all hits-on-tracks in IBL modules. The parameter \(\mu\) represent the mean of the distributions.

The distributions are integrated over all hits-on-tracks in the barrel modules of pixel layer one, two and three. The parameter \(\mu\) represent the mean of the distributions.

distribution of the local \(x^{\prime}\) residuals mean indicates an in-plane deformation of the IBL stays in the negative local \(x^{\prime}\) direction with respect to the nominal geometry. The distribution in local \(y^{\prime}\) indicates a systematic displacement of the modules along the global \(z\) axis of the IBL stays. As all IBL stays were loaded from the stave-center outwards, such a stave elongation with respect to the nominal geometry may be due to a wider intermediary gap between neighbouring modules with respect to the nominal geometry. A module level alignment (level PIX 3) corrects both observed stave deformations (Fig. 6).

### Track parameter resolution

The expected resolution of the perigee track parameters (\(\tau\)) can be calculated using reconstructed and split tracks from cosmic-ray data, illustrated in Fig. 7. Since muon tracks from cosmic-ray events traverse the detector from top to bottom, the resolutions can only be derived for the barrel detectors. In order to select tracks with good quality, the split tracks are each required to have at least 1, 8 and 25 hits in the barrel of the Pixel, SCT and TRT detectors respectively, and a transverse momentum of more than 2 GeV. The perigee parameters, \(\tau_{\mathrm{up}}\) and \(\tau_{\mathrm{down}}\), of each split-track pair are compared to each other and their difference \(\Delta\)(up-down) is compared before and after alignment (Fig. 8). Since both tracks come from the same particle, their difference for each perigee parameter \(\tau\) has a variance \(\sigma^{2}(\Delta\tau)\), which is two times the variance of the parameters of each track. The resolution of the track parameter is therefore given by the root mean square of the \(\Delta\tau\) distribution divided by \(\sqrt{2}\). A bias of \(-19\)\(\mu\)m in \(\Delta d_{0}\) and of \(-9.4\) TeV\({}^{-1}\) in \(\Delta(q/p_{T})\) has been corrected, with the track parameter resolution being reduced from 69 to 39 \(\mu\)m and 3.5 to 1.4 TeV\({}^{-1}\), respectively. The resolution in \(\Delta\phi_{0}\) has been improved after alignment from 0.64 to 0.38 mrad and \(\Delta z_{0}\) from 160 to 134 \(\mu\)m.

## 6 Conclusions

During the LS1 a number of upgrades have been performed on the ATLAS ID, including the addition of the IBL. In order to determine the positions of all previously installed ID systems and the IBL, a first track-based alignment was performed, exploiting cosmic-ray events recorded with the ATLAS detector. Data collected in February 2015 with the solenoidal magnetic field on have been used to determine the positions at module level (PIX level 3) for both the Pixel and IBL detectors. The alignment performance has been quantified using the FWHM/2.35 of the track-to-hit residual distributions for each ID subdetector. The IBL global position has been determined at micron level with an averaged module resolution of 32 \(\mu\)m (local \(x^{\prime}\)). The resolution of track parameters was measured by comparing two segments of a cosmic-ray track. After detector alignment, the impact parameter resolutions for tracks were found to be 39 \(\mu\)m and 134 \(\mu\)m in the transverse and longitudinal directions, respectively. A large bias in the reconstructed track charge over transverse momentum (\(q/p_{T}\)) has been corrected to 0.07 TeV\({}^{-1}\).

The observed results are comparable with respect to the results obtained during the 2008 cosmic-ray data campaign before the start of Run I [8], despite a factor \(\approx\)4 lower statistics in 2015.
