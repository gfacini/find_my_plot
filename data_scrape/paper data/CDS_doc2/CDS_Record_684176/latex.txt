###### Abstract

At the LHC, one of the Standard Model fundamental parameters that will be measured with high accuracy, is the mass of the \(top\) quark. About 8 million \(t\overline{t}\) pairs are expected to be produced per year at low luminosity, so that the error on the determination of \(M_{top}\) will be dominated by systematics.

In this note, the contribution to the systematic error from the Monte-Carlo modelling and reconstruction algorithm, is evaluated.

The production of \(t\overline{t}\) pairs is simulated using Pythia, Herwig and Isajet generators. Different methods to reconstruct the \(W\) and the \(top\) mass are compared.

## 1 Introduction

One of the goals of the experiments at the LHC collider is a precision measurement of the mass of the top quark (\(M_{top}\)), a fundamental parameter of the Standard Model (SM). Radiative corrections relate \(M_{top}\) and \(M_{W}\) to the mass of the SM Higgs boson, as seen in figure 1 showing the SM relationship between the \(W\) and \(top\) masses as a function of the Higgs mass. The error on the \(W\) mass is 38 MeV/\(c^{2}\) and the error on the \(top\) mass is 5.1 GeV/\(c^{2}\)[2]. Assuming that \(M_{W}\) can be measured with a precision of \(\pm\) 15 MeV/\(c^{2}\)[1], a determination of \(\delta M_{top}\leq\)\(\pm\) 2 GeV/\(c^{2}\) would be required to match that from \(M_{W}\) and from the current theoretical uncertainties. Assuming the Higgs prior to LHC or n the first year of LHC running, those determinations would serve as consistency checks of the model, either SM or beyond. Moreover, modelsbeyond the SM which attempt to explain in a more fundamental way the origin of mass and the observed fermion mass hierarchy, such as top-bottom-tau Yukawa coupling unification in a super-symmetric SO(10) GUT [3], would profit from a precision of the order \(\delta M_{top}\simeq\pm\) 1 GeV/\(c^{2}\).

With the large rate of top quark events which will be available at the LHC [5] (about 8 million/year at low luminosity), the uncertainty in the measurement of \(M_{top}\) will be dominated by the systematic errors. The studies presented in [4] concentrated on the influence on the \(M_{top}\) measurement of various _physics-related_ sources of uncertainties, such as initial and final state radiation, and uncertainties in the knowledge of the \(b-quark\) fragmentation, as well as of _detector-related_ effects, such as calibration and understanding of the jet energy scale. The resulting uncertainty for the case when the top mass is reconstructed in the single lepton channel (that is, for the process: \(t\overline{t}\to W^{+}bW^{-}\overline{b}\to l^{+}\nu bjj\overline{b}\)) is of the order of 2 GeV/\(c^{2}\).

The QCD Monte Carlo generators used in these analysis are highly complex algorithms which are based on a number of model-dependent assumptions and parameters. Modifying one of these parameters, does not give necessarily a good estimate for the deviation between the simulated process

and the real physics process. The direct comparison of different Monte Carlo generators can give additional hints on the amount of the systematic uncertainties involved in measurements. Possible shifts in the _top_ mass, are studied using different algorithms for the invariant mass reconstruction.

## 2 Energy and mass scale calibration of the hadronic calorimeters

In the ATLAS detector, the energy/mass scale of the sub-detectors will be set with physics events.

For the hadronic calorimeters, \(Z\)+1 jet events with \(Z\to l^{+}l^{-}\) (\(l=e,\,\mu\)), are envisaged to set the energy scale through the balance of the \(P_{T}^{Z}\) and \(P_{T}^{jet}\). Additionally, the mass scale can be set through the \(W\to jj\) sample from the semi-leptonic decay of \(t\overline{t}\) events.

As a first step the hadronic energy scale for \(light-jets\) and for \(b-jets\) is set with \(Z\)+1 jet events. In these the \(Z\) and the \(jet\) are back to back. The \(Z\) is reconstructed from the 2 \(leptons\), the ratio \(R=P_{T}^{Z}/P_{T}^{j}\) is evaluated on an event by event basis and plotted against \(P_{T}^{j}\). The two curves obtained in this way are the corrections to be applied to the \(light-jets\) and to the \(b-jets\)\(P_{T}\).

Afterwards, the mass scale is set with an overall calibration constant (\(C_{mas\,s}\)). A large \(W\to jj\) sample can be selected from \(t\overline{t}\) semi-leptonic events. The pair of \(light-jets\) is reconstructed, and the \(M_{jj}\) peak is matched with the \(W\) mass (\(M_{W}\)1) through the ratio \(C_{mass\,s}=M_{W}/M_{jj}\). This constant is applied globally to the \(P_{T}\) of \(light-jets\) and \(b-jets\).

Footnote 1: As reported in [2]

This calibration procedure uses the knowledge of the \(Z\) mass which is known with a precision of 2 MeV/\(c^{2}\), and of the \(W\) mass which is known with a precision better than 40 MeV/\(c^{2}\) (\(M_{W}=80.419\pm 0.038\) GeV/\(c^{2}\)) [2].

### Monte Carlo samples of \(Z\)+1 jet - first calibration step

A sample of 8 million \(Z\)+1 jet events was generated with Pythia 6.115 [8] and passed through the ATLAS fast simulation package (ATLFAST 2.22 [6]).

The \(Z\) was required to decay to \(\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\). The CTEQ4 \(\overline{MS}\) parton distribution function set was used [7]. All the effects like initial state radiation (\(ISR\)), final state radiation (\(FSR\)), hadronization (\(HAD\)) and multiple interactions\((MI)\), were included. The hard process was generated with a minimum \(P_{T}\) of 20 GeV/\(c\).

The event selection/reconstruction is the following:

* 2 \(\mu\)'s with \(P_{T}^{\mu}\geq\) 6 GeV/\(c\) and \(|\eta^{\mu}|\leq\) 2.5.
* 1 jet with \(P_{T}^{j}\geq\) 15 GeV/\(c\) and \(|\eta^{j}|\leq\) 5 for light jets, or \(|\eta^{j}|\leq\) 2.5 for \(c-jets\) and \(b-jets\).
* Jets are reconstructed with a fixed cone algorithm with \(\Delta R=0.4\).
* The \(\mu\mu\) invariant mass should satisfy \(|M_{\mu\mu}-M_{W}|\leq\) 20 GeV/\(c^{2}\).

Due to \(ISR\) and \(FSR\), there are in general more than 1 jet/event (in about 77% of the events). In this way, to perform a proper calibration of the jets \(P_{T}\), one selects events with exactly one jet (and two \(\mu\)'s). If more than one jet is present in the event, the \(P_{T}\) balance between the \(Z\) and the jet is worse, and the calibration can be overestimated.

The selection criteria yield about 18% of the generated sample, from which about 4.5% are \(b-jets\). In order to increase the statistics for \(b-jets\), an additional sample of 32 million events was generated, requiring one \(b-jet\) in the event.

Figure 2 shows the \(P_{T}\) spectrum of the \(Z\) (left), and the \(P_{T}\) spectrum of the \(light-jet\) (right). The average \(P_{T}\) for these events is \(\sim\) 40 GeV/\(c\), extending to about 250 GeV/\(c\).

Figure 3 shows the distribution of the distance \(\Delta R\) (in \(\eta-\phi\) plane) between the \(Z\) and the \(light-jet\) on the left and between the \(Z\) and the \(b-jet\) on the right. The distributions peak at the value \(\sim\pi\), justifying the calibration method.

To calibrate the jets \(P_{T}\), the following ratio is used:

\[R=\frac{P_{T}^{Z}}{P_{T}^{j}} \tag{1}\]

\(R\) is calculated separately for \(light-jets\) and for \(b-jets\). \(R\) is then plotted against \(P_{T}^{j}\), as shown in figure 4-left for \(light-jets\) and 4-right for \(b-jets\)Figure 3: \(\Delta R\) between the \(Z\) and the \(light-jet\) (left), and between the \(Z\) and the \(b-jet\) (right).

Figure 2: Left - \(P_{T}^{Z}\) spectrum. Right - \(P_{T}^{jets}\) spectrum for \(light-jets\).

A fit is performed to the ratio \(R\) with the following function:

\[R=f(P_{T}^{j})=A+B\times\exp{(-C\times P_{T}^{j})}+D\times\exp{(-E\times P_{T}^{j })} \tag{2}\]

Table 1 shows the parameters and \(\chi^{2}/n.d.f.\) obtained from a fit to equation 2, for \(light-jets\) and for \(b-jets\).

The \(A\) parameter is the high \(P_{T}\) correction (typically for \(P_{T}\geq 150\) GeV /\(c\)). It can be seen that this correction is 1.6% above unity for \(light-jets\) and about 4% for \(b-jets\). Figure 5 shows the fitted correction function for \(light-jets\) and for \(b-jets\), showing that the correction for \(b-jets\) is higher than that for \(light-jets\).

### \(W\) and \(top\) reconstruction - second calibration step

A sample of 4 million \(t\overline{t}\) events in the semi-leptonic channel, were generated with Pythia 6.115, with \(M_{W}=80.33\) GeV/\(c^{2}\) and \(M_{top}=175\) GeV/\(c^{2}\). The CTEQ4 \(\overline{MS}\) parton distribution function set was used. As in the previous section, all the effects like \(ISR\), \(FSR\), hadronization (\(HAD\)) and \(MI\), were included. The hard process was generated with a minimum \(P_{T}\) of 20 GeV/\(c\).

The events selection is the same as was used in [4]:

* \(\geq\) 1 \(\mu\) with \(P_{T}^{\mu}\)\(\geq\) 20 GeV/\(c\) and \(|\eta^{\mu}|\)\(\leq\) 2.5.
* \(\not\!\!E_{T}\)\(\geq\) 20 GeV/\(c\).
* \(\geq\) 4 jets with \(P_{T}^{j}\)\(\geq\) 40 GeV/\(c\) and \(|\eta^{j}|\)\(\leq\) 2.5, from which at least 2 are \(b-tagged\).

The \(W\) is reconstructed with the pair \(light-jets\) which have the highest \(P_{T}\) in the event, and the \(top\) is formed from those 2 \(light-jets\) with the \(b-jet\) which makes the highest \(P_{T}\) for the \(top\).

The \(W\) and \(top\) invariant mass distributions are shown in figure 6, in the case when the jets \(P_{T}\) are uncorrected.

Figure 5: Correction function for \(light-jets\) and for \(b-jets\).

The jets \(P_{T}\) was corrected using the parameters shown in table 1. After the first correction step, the mass scale is correct within 2%. In the second step, the \(M_{jj}\) is set equal to the \(W\) mass through the constant \(C_{mass}\), which was determined to be:

\[C_{mass}=\frac{M_{W}}{M_{jj}}=1.019 \tag{3}\]

The \(C_{ma\,ss}\) correction is applied globally to the jets \(P_{T}\) (both \(light-jets\) and \(b-jets\)), resulting in the \(M_{jj}\) and \(M_{jjb}\) invariant mass shown in figure 7.

After all corrections, the \(M_{jj}\) peak is 80.34 GeV/\(c^{2}\). On the other hand, the \(M_{jjb}\) peak has a value of 175.0 GeV/\(c^{2}\), which means that the \(C_{mass}\) correction applied to the \(M_{jj}\) invariant mass spectrum (through the \(light-jets\)\(P_{T}\)), scales linearly up to the \(top\) mass, and is correct also for the \(b-jets\)\(P_{T}\) scale. For the rest of this study, those corrections will be applied to all the \(t\overline{t}\) samples, irrespective of the Monte-Carlo generator or reconstruction method.

Figure 6: Left - \(M_{jj}\) invariant mass from the pair of \(light-jets\) with highest \(P_{T}\). Right - \(M_{jjb}\) invariant mass formed with the pair of \(light-jets\) with the \(b-jet\) which makes the highest \(P_{T}\)\(top\). The jets \(P_{T}\) are uncorrected.

## 3 Study of \(M_{top}\) and \(M_{w}\)

### Monte Carlo Samples

In this section, the comparison between three Monte Carlo (MC's) generators (Herwig 6.1, Pythia 6.115 and Isajet 7.49) is performed. These generators are described in ref. [8, 9, 10]. The input values are \(M_{top}=175\) GeV/\(c^{2}\) and \(M_{W}=80.33\) GeV/\(c^{2}\), and a hard process \(P_{T}\) cut \(\geq 20\) GeV/\(c\), was applied.

The CTEQ4 \(\overline{MS}\) parton distribution function set was used [7]. The events were passed through ATLFAST, and the jets where corrected using the calibration parameters found with Pythia in section 2.

### Event selection

Events are selected using the same cuts as in section 2.2. Those cuts were optimised to reduce the physics background, and to achieve a \(S/B\) ratio of about 65 [4]. Four million events were generated with each MC. Table 2 shows the number and fraction of events after the selection cuts.

The fraction of selected events is similar for the three MC's, being 11.8% for Pythia and Isajet, and slightly higher for Herwig (12.7%).

Figure 7: \(M_{jj}\) and \(M_{jjb}\), after all corrections to the jets \(P_{T}\). Left - \(M_{jj}\) spectrum. Right - \(M_{jjb}\) spectrum.

### Comparison between simulations

Figure 8 shows the \(light-jet\) multiplicity (\(N_{jet}\)) after the selection cuts, for the three generators (Pythia is the full line, Herwig is the dashed line and Isajet is the dotted line). The shape of the histograms look similar for the three MC's, but Isajet has a higher multiplicity than Pythia and Herwig for \(N_{jet}\geq\,5\).

This indicates that Isajet produces more gluon radiation than the other generators.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|c|} \hline  & Pythia & Herwig & Isajet \\ \hline \# events selected & 471135 & 507074 & 472939 \\ \hline Fraction of events & 11.8\% & 12.7\% & 11.8\% \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 2: Number and fraction (%) of events after selection cuts for each physics generator.

Figure 8: \(Light-jet\) multiplicity after selection cuts. Pythia - full line. Herwig - dashed line. Isajet - dotted line.

The \(W\to jj\) is reconstructed from the pair of \(jj\) with an invariant mass closest to \(M_{W}\). The top candidate is formed by adding to the \(W\) candidates within a window of \([M_{jj}-M_{W}]\leq 20\) GeV/\(c^{2}\), the \(b-tagged\) jet which results in the highest \(P_{T}^{top}\)[4].

Figure 9 shows the \(P_{T}\) spectrum of the most energetic \(light-jet\) on the upper left, of the \(b-jet\) on the upper right, of the \(\mu\) on the lower left, and the missing \(P_{T}\) on the lower right (Pythia is the full line, Herwig is the dashed line and Isajet is the dotted line).

No differences are observed between Pythia and Herwig in the \(b-jet\)\(P_{T}\) spectrum, nor in the \(P_{T}^{\mu}\) and missing \(P_{T}\) spectra. In the spectrum of the highest \(P_{T}\) jet, Herwig has more events around the peak than Pythia (and Isajet), and less events in the high \(P_{T}\) region (\(P_{T}\geq 200\) GeV/\(c\)). Isajet is similar to Herwig in this region.

The differences between Isajet and Pythia/Herwig in the \(b-jets\) and \(\mu\) spectra are small and in the region of the peak. In the missing \(P_{T}\) and \(light-jet\) spectra, Isajet has more events than Pythia/Herwig in the mid \(P_{T}\) region (\(100\leq P_{T}\leq 200\) GeV/\(c\)) and the peak value is also at a slightly higher value, indicating that Isajet produces harder jets.

Figure 10 shows \(P_{T}^{W}\) on the upper-left, \(P_{T}^{top}\) on the upper-right, \(\eta^{W}\) on the lower-left and \(\eta^{top}\) on the lower-right, for the three MC's (Pythia is the full line, Herwig is the dashed line and Isajet is the dotted line). The \(W\)\(P_{T}\) spectrum is similar for the three generators, with a small difference in the high \(P_{T}\) region (\(P_{T}\geq 200\) GeV/\(c\)), in which Pythia has a higher number of events than Herwig and Isajet.

The \(top\)\(P_{T}\) spectrum is similar for Pythia and Herwig, while Isajet has a slightly higher number of events in the mid \(P_{T}\) range of 100-200 GeV/\(c\). The \(\eta^{W}\) distribution is similar for Pythia and Herwig, while Isajet produced a slightly broader distribution. On the other hand the \(\eta^{top}\) is similar for the three generators.

Figure 11 shows the invariant \(M_{jj}\) spectrum (left) and the invariant \(M_{jjb}\) spectrum (right), for the three MC's (Pythia is the full line, Herwig is the dashed line and Isajet is the dotted line). No differences are observed between Pythia and Herwig, while Isajet presents bigger high mass tails and the peak is at a lower value in both spectra.

A Gaussian fit was performed to the \(W\) mass spectrum in the range \(\pm\) 7 GeV/\(c^{2}\) around the mean Gaussian value. For the \(top\), the fit was Figure 9: \(P_{T}\) spectrum of the most energetic \(light-jet\) (upper left), of the \(b-jet\) (upper right), of the \(\mu\) (lower-left), and the missing \(P_{T}\) (lower right). Pythia - full line. Herwig - dashed line. Isajet - dotted line.

performed in the range \(\pm\) 12 GeV/\(c^{2}\) around the mean Gaussian value. The values obtained for the mean and resolution (\(\sigma\)) are shown in table 3, as well as the errors from the fit, and the \(\chi^{2}\)/_n.d.f._. The last two columns of this table show the difference in the mean and resolution between Herwig and Pythia, and between Isajet and Pythia, respectively (Pythia being taken as a reference).

It can be seen that the position of the \(W\) mass peak in Isajet is 1.7 GeV/\(c^{2}\) below than in Pythia and in Herwig. On the contrary, in these last two MC's there is no difference neither in the mean nor the resolution.

A very good agreement is obtained between Pythia and Herwig for the _top_ mass and resolution, the difference being compatible with zero within 1 \(\sigma\) of the statistical error from the fit. The values for the reconstructed _top_ mass agree with the generated _M\({}_{top}\)_ value within 2 \(\sigma\) of the statistical error from the fit, validating the calibration procedure. On the other hand, the difference between Pythia/Herwig and Isajet is 2 GeV/\(c^{2}\), one should recall that the same corrections are applied to all generators. If one rescaled the _M\({}_{jj}\)_(\(C_{mass}\)_ like) obtained in Isajet to the _M\({}_{W}\)_ mass (a factor of 1.021), a reconstructed _top_ mass value of 176.4 GeV/\(c^{2}\), is obtained, which is 1.5 GeV/\(c^{2}\) higher than that for the other generators.

Figure 11: Invariant \(M_{jj}\) spectrum (left), and \(M_{jjb}\) (right). Pythia - full line. Herwig - dashed line. Isajet - dotted line.

The fact that Isajet _"needs"_ a different correction, can be partly due to the fact that a higher amount of gluon radiation is generated. In the high range of the \(W\) and _top_ mass spectrum, the tails are larger in Isajet than in Pythia and Herwig.

## 4 Alternative reconstruction of \(M_{w}\) and \(M_{top}\)

The reconstruction of an invariant \(jj\) mass that best matches the \(W\) mass, biases \(M_{jj}\) towards \(M_{W}\). In this section, an alternative method to reconstruct the \(W\) that does not bias the \(M_{jj}\) mass spectrum is presented.

The pair of highest \(P_{T}\)\(light-jets\) in the event, are used to reconstruct the \(W\). The _top_ is reconstructed with the \(b-jet\) which makes the highest \(P_{T}^{top}\). Events should satisfy\(|M_{jj}-M_{W}|\leq 20\) GeV/\(c^{2}\). The selection cuts are the same as in section 2.2.

Figure 12 shows the \(W\) (left) and _top_ (right) invariant mass spectrum for the three generators superimposed. It can be seen that both Pythia and Herwig have very similar spectra (full and dashed line histograms), while Isajet (dotted histogram) presents more events in the high mass tails of both spectra, as already seen with the algorithm presented in section 3.3.

Table 4 shows the parameters obtained by fitting the \(W\) and _top_ mass spectra, with a Gaussian in the range \(\pm\) 7 GeV/\(c^{2}\) around the peak for the \(W\) and \(\pm\) 12 GeV/\(c^{2}\) for the _top_.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|} \hline  & Pythia & Herwig & Isajet & Her - Pyt & Isa - Pyt \\ \hline \hline \(<M_{W}>\) (GeV/\(c^{2}\)) & 80.4 5\(\pm\)0.03 & 80.4 4\(\pm\)0.03 & 78.71\(\pm\)0.03 & -0.01\(\pm\)0.04 & -1.74\(\pm\)0.04 \\ \(\sigma_{W}\) (GeV/\(c^{2}\)) & 6.56\(\pm\)0.05 & 6.65\(\pm\)0.05 & 7.14\(\pm\)0.07 & 0.09\(\pm\)0.07 & 0.58\(\pm\)0.09 \\ \(\chi^{2}/N.D.F.\) & 1.9 & 2.2 & 3.1 & & \\ \hline \hline \(<M_{top}>\) (GeV/\(c^{2}\)) & 174.8 \(\pm\)0.1 & 174.9 \(\pm\)0.1 & 172.8 \(\pm\)0.1 & 0.1\(\pm\)0.1 & -2.0\(\pm\)0.1 \\ \(\sigma_{top}\) (GeV/\(c^{2}\)) & 12.4 \(\pm\)0.1 & 12.2 \(\pm\)0.1 & 12.8 \(\pm\)0.2 & -0.2\(\pm\)0.2 & 0.4\(\pm\)0.2 \\ \(\chi^{2}/n.d.f.\) & 2.0 & 4.4 & 2.7 & & \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}

Also shown the resolution (\(\sigma\)), respective errors from the fit and \(\chi^{2}/n.d.f.\). Reconstruction as in the Atlas Physics TDR (see text for det ails).

In Pythia and Herwig, both the reconstructed \(W\) and \(top\,\)mass, as well as the resolutions, agree within \(2\,\sigma\) of the statistical error from the fit and with the input mass values.

The difference in the \(W\) and \(top\,\)mass, between Isajet and Pythia/Herwig is slightly enhanced with this reconstruction algorithm, being \(2.5\,\,\mathrm{GeV}/c^{2}\) for the \(W\) compared with \(1.7\,\,\mathrm{GeV}/c^{2}\) with the algorithm of the previous section.

Comparison between reconstruction algorithms

A comparison between different \(W\) and _top_ reconstruction algorithms, is presented in this section. This analysis is performed with the sample generated with Pythia 6.115, the event selection is the same as in section 2.2.

For the \(W\) reconstruction we have the following:

1. Method \(W1\) - The \(W\) candidate is formed from the pair of \(light-jets\) for which \(M_{jj}\) is closest to \(M_{W}\) (section 3.3).
2. Method \(W2\) - The \(W\) candidate is formed from the pair of \(light-jets\) which have the highest \(P_{T}\) in the event (section 4).

For the _top_ reconstruction we have the following:

1. Method \(T1\) - The _top_ candidate is formed from the pair of \(light-jets\) for which \(M_{jj}\) is closest to \(M_{W}\) and with the \(b-jet\) which gives the highest \(P_{T}\)_top_ (section 3.3).
2. Method \(T2\) - The _top_ candidate is formed from the pair of \(light-jets\) which have the highest \(P_{T}\) in the event and the \(b-jet\) which gives the highest \(P_{T}\)_top_ (section 4).
3. Method \(T3\) - The _top_ candidate is formed from the pair of \(light-jets\) which have the highest \(P_{T}\) in the event and the \(b-jet\) which is furthest from the \(\mu\) in the \(\eta\times\phi\) plane, i.e., with the highest \(\Delta R_{b-\mu}\).

To compare the efficiency of the different reconstruction methods, a _perfect_ assignment between the quarks and jets was performed. In a given event, one jet is considered to come from a certain quark, if the distance \(\Delta R\) between the jet and that quark is the lowest from all the \(jet-quark\) combinations and satisfies \(\Delta R_{jet-quark}\leq 0.2\). In this way, the two jets which matched the \(2\) initial quarks are the correct pair which resulted from the \(W\) decay. The \(b-jet\) which has matched the \(b-quark\), is the correct one to form the \(top-quark\), one also requires the matching of the other \(b-jet\) with the \(\overline{b}-quark\). A pure sample is thus obtained.

The fraction of events for which a _perfect_ match between 4 jets and the 4 quarks is obtained, is 50 %. Table 5 shows the fraction of jets which are correct for each reconstruction method, considering the whole invariant mass spectrum and inside a window \(\left|M_{jj}-M_{W}\right|\leq\) 20 GeV/\(c^{2}\).

Considering the whole \(M_{jj}\) spectrum, method \(W1\) has a higher probability to peak up the correct pair of jets than method \(W2\). But inside a window \(|\!M_{jj}\!-\!M_{W}|\leq 20\) GeV/\(c^{2}\), method \(W2\) has a higher fraction of events reconstructed with the correct jets.

The fraction of \(b\!-\!jets\) which are peaked up correctly by each of the 3 _top_ reconstruction methods (\(T1\), \(T2\) and \(T3\)) is similar, being 65% considering the whole \(M_{jib}\) spectrum and 81% inside a mass window of \(|\!M_{jj}\!-\!M_{top}|\leq 35\) GeV/\(c^{2}\).

The fraction of events which fall inside a \(M_{jj}\) window of 20 GeV/\(c^{2}\) is 55% for method \(W1\) and 37% for method \(W2\). Similarly, the fraction of events which fall inside a \(M_{jjb}\) window of 35 GeV/\(c^{2}\), is 40% for method \(T1\) and 28% for methods \(T2\) and \(T3\).

The efficiency to reconstruct the \(W\) or the _top_, is the ratio of the number of events for which the \(W\) or the _top_ were correctly reconstructed over the total number of events. Table 6 and 7 shows the efficiency for the \(W\) and _top_ reconstruction, respectively, over the whole invariant mass spectrum and inside the mass windows (defined previously).

It can be seen that the methods \(W1\)-\(T1\) have an efficiency which is 6-7 % higher than the other methods taking into account the whole invariant mass spectra. On the other hand, the efficiency of \(W1\)-\(T1\) inside the mass windows is 4-6 % lower than that for \(W2\)-\(T2\)/\(T3\) reconstruction methods. This is in

\begin{tabular}{||c|c|c||} \hline \hline  & \multicolumn{2}{|c||}{Efficiency to reconstruct \(W\)} \\ \cline{2-3}  & Method \(W1\) & Method \(W2\) \\ \hline Whole spectrum & 30.3 \% & 22.8 \% \\ \(W\) window & 52.6 \% & 58.6 \% \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}

agreement with the previous analysis on the fraction of correct jets which are used in the \(W/top\) reconstruction.

Overall, reconstructing the \(W\) and \(top\) with methods \(W1/T1\), yields a higher statistic inside the respective mass windows, but with a slightly lower efficiency compared with methods \(W2/T2\)-\(T3\).

Figure 13 shows on the left the \(W\) mass spectrum reconstructed with the 2 algorithms (\(W1\) is the full line and \(W2\) the dashed line). Method \(W2\) has a larger high mass tail than \(W1\), but the mean values are the same, shown in table 8. Also shown in figure 13 right, is the \(top\) spectrum reconstructed with the 3 methods (\(T1\) full line, method \(T2\) dashed line and method \(T3\) is the dotted line), in which case no differences are observed, and neither in the fitted mass values (c.f. table 8).

In the 3 algorithms used to reconstruct the \(top\), only the events which are inside a window \(|\!|M_{jj}-M_{W}|\!|\leq 20\) GeV\(/c^{2}\) are selected, this explains the similar \(top\) mass spectrums which are obtained in the 3 cases.

Figure 14 shows the \(W\) mass spectrum with the combinatorial background superimposed (algorithm \(W1\) on the left and algorithm \(W2\) on the right). An event is considered a combinatorial background if at least one of the jets that are used to to reconstruct the \(W\) did not match an initial light quark.

It can be seen that combinatorial background in algorithm \(W2\) has a quite smoothshape, while the one in method \(W1\) presents a peak structure around the \(W\) mass value. This is explained by the way the \(W\) is reconstructed in \(W1\), which chooses the pair of jets which give \(M_{jj}\) closest to \(M_{W}\).

## 6 Summary and conclusions

In this note, a first comparison between three physics generators, Pythia 6.115, Herwig 6.1 and Isajet 7.49 in \(t\overline{t}\) semi-leptonic events, and interfaced with ATLFAST 2.22 has been performed.

The _jet_\(P_{T}\) calibration, was studied with physics events generated with Pythia 6.115, and applied to the \(t\overline{t}\) samples from the other three Monte Carlos.

The \(W\) and _top_ masses were reconstructed with different algorithms, and their perfomance and efficiencies were compared.

Figure 13: Left - \(W\) mass spectrum with method \(W1\) full line, and method \(W2\) dashed line. Right - _top_ mass spectrum with method \(T1\) full line, method \(T2\) dashed line, and method \(T3\) dotted line.

The following conclusions can be drawn:

* No difference is observed between Pythia and Herwig in the reconstructed \(W\) and \(top\,\)mass spectra, nor in the spectra of other kinematic variables studied in the event. The jet energy calibration performed with events generated with Pythia turns out to be a valid calibration also for events generated with Herwig. A maximum difference in \(M_{top}\) of 100 MeV/\(c^{2}\) is obtained between those two generators.
* Small differences are observed in the \(P_{T}\) spectra of \(light-jets\) and missing \(E_{T}\) between Isajet and Pythia. Also, the jet multiplicity is higher in Isajet, indicating a higher production of gluon radiation with respect to Pythia. This is somehow _translated_ in the shapes of the reconstructed \(W\) and \(top\,\)mass spectra, which presents larger tails at high values of the mass, lower values for the \(W\) and \(top\,\)masses and broader distribution. This indicates that the jet energy calibration is underestimating the corrections which should be applied in Isajet.
* The \(W1\)-\(T1\) reconstruction algorithm, yields a higher statistic than \(W2\)-\(T2/T3\), inside the \(W\) and \(top\,\)mass windows, but with an efficiency which is lower by 4-6%.
* The different reconstruction algorithms produce different \(W\) invariant

mass spectra and combinatorial background. For the _top_, the spectra are similar because of the \(W\) mass window selection cut. In spite of those differences, the \(W\) and _top_ mass and resolution differ by no more than 200 MeV/\(c^{2}\).
* A conservative estimate of the contribution to the systematic uncertainty in \(M_{top}\) of 300 MeV/\(c^{2}\) is obtained, coming from different MC's and different reconstruction methods. This, without taking into account Isajet (see next point). The value for this contribution to the systematic uncertainty is of the order of the expected statistical uncertainty (100-200 MeV/\(c^{2}\)).
* Taking into account the difference between Pythia (or Herwig) and Isajet, a systematic error of 2 GeV/\(c^{2}\) or higher due to MC generators, would be extracted. This contribution alone, amounts to the expected precision in the top mass (2 GeV/\(c^{2}\)), quoted in the ATLAS Physics TDR [4]. On the other hand, it is known from the CDF collaboration [11] that Isajet does not reproduce well the kinematics of \(t\overline{t}\) events due to the models implemented in this generator, as the use of independent fragmentation and incoherent shower evolution.

In the future, a more robust \(W\) and _top_ reconstruction like the kinematic fit to the event, will be performed, as well as a more detailed study of initial and final state gluon radiation, and it's influence on the _top_ mass measurement.
