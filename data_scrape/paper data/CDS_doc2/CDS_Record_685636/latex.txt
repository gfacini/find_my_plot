Introduction

The TGT calorimeter is actually being discussed as a potential candidate for the electromagnetic end-cap calorimeter of the ATLAS detector. The concept of the calorimeter has been presented in a R\(\&\)D proposal [1], where also the design goals for the performance were specified. In order to evaluate the calorimeter performance and to demonstrate that the design goals can be reached with the present design, an extensive simulation program has been undertaken. It allows in addition a comparison with the experimental test beam data which are presently being collected.

In this note results are presented on the resolution, on the homogeneity of the signal response, on the photon direction measurement and on the \(\mathrm{e}/\pi\) and \(\gamma/\pi^{0}\) separation. First, the resolution and the homogeneity of the response, which are determined by the intrinsic features of the TGT design, are evaluated for the generic TGT test beam module, as presented in Ref. [1]. Concerning the application of the TGT in the ATLAS end-caps, some important design parameters, like the transverse granularity and the total calorimeter thickness. are discussed. Then the performance relevant for the operation under real LHC conditions is evaluated, taking electronic noise and pile-up contributions from minimum bias events into account.

The proposed TGT calorimeter module as presented in Ref.[1] has been described in the framework of the SLUG/GEANT simulation programme. All details of the layer structure of the individual readout cells are taken into account. This includes the steel cladding of the absorber plates, their correct orientation, resulting in regions with dead liquid argon between individual modules, dead zones in the liquid argon gaps resulting from feed-throughs, as well as additional material from spacers and rivets. The layout of the simulated setup of the generic TGT module is shown schematically in Fig. 1.

It should be noted that the present note contains only a summary of the results. For details the reader is referred to the various TGT internal notes.

Performance of the Generic TGT Module

### Response and Resolution for Electrons

In order to determine the energy resolution and the response of the TGT calorimeter, showers from electrons at five different energies \(E_{0}\) in the energy range from 10 to 100 GeV were simulated in the proposed calorimeter structure. The angle of incidence was fixed to be \(45^{\circ}\) with respect to the absorber plates. The observed energy distributions in a matrix of \(5\times 3\) cells were fitted by Gaussian distributions and the mean values (E) and the standard deviations (\(\sigma\)) from these fits were used to calculate the resolution. In Fig. 2\((\frac{\sigma}{E})^{2}E_{0}\) is plotted as a function of the electron energy. The results are well described by the usual form

\[\frac{\sigma}{E}=\frac{\alpha}{\sqrt{E_{0}}}\oplus\beta \tag{1}\]

with a sampling term \(\alpha\) and a constant term \(\beta\). From the Monte Carlo data one obtains the results:

\[\begin{array}{ll}\alpha&=9.50\ \pm 0.09\ \%\\ \beta&=0.00\ \pm 0.13\ \%\end{array}\]

As expected, the sampling term is found to be below 10% and the constant term is compatible with zero. Electronic noise has not been included in the present simulation. It will lead to an additional term of the form \(\gamma/E\) in eq. (1), where \(\gamma\) has been estimated to be \(\sim\)180 MeV for the electron volume considered [2].

The results for the energy response \(E/E_{0}\) are shown in Fig. 3. A uniform behaviour is found, with deviations from linearity on a level of \(\pm 0.2\%\). These deviations are due to energy losses in the non-sensitive liquid argon (LAr) between the individual absorber elements. More detailed studies about this subject can be found in Ref. [3]. It should be noted that the point at 40 GeV has been chosen to fix the calibration of the electromagnetic energy scale. The simulated calorimeter module has a thickness corresponding to 25.3 radiation lengths (\(X_{0}\)), hence effects of longitudinal leakage could be important in the high energy region. Therefore events for which the visible energy in the last longitudinal compartment did exceed 0.5% of the total deposited energy in a tower, were not included in the present analysis.

### Homogeneity of the Signal Response

In order to study the homogeneity of the signal response scans have been performed for electrons of 40 GeV in two directions. In the \(\theta\)-direction scans were used to test whether there are variations in the response resulting from variations in the impact medium at the front face of the calorimeter in the same absorber element. With changing polar angle the electron beam will hit in the same absorber element first either active liquid argon. lead or stainless steel. In addition a scan over a large range of polar angle has been performed in order to check the intrinsic homogeneity provided by the orientation of the absorber plates under 45\({}^{\circ}\) with respect to the incident particle. Small differences could be due to different amounts of non sensitive liquid argon in between different absorber elements at different polar angles. Scans in the y-direction are used to test variations due to the fine structure of the calorimeter (dead zones in the liquid argon gaps, rivets, spacers).

The results obtained for the scan across the front face of one absorber element are shown in Fig. 4, where the variations in the visible energy in the total calorimeter are shown as a function of the impact point. The impact positions are indicated in the figure. The variations are found to be small and are on average below \(\pm\)0.1%.

The results of the second scan, where the electrons are entering into different absorber elements in the range of polar angle between 54\({}^{\circ}\) and 59\({}^{\circ}\) are shown in Fig. 5. One should keep in mind that due to the construction of the module the impact angle with respect to the absorber plates is constant at 45\({}^{\circ}\) in each point. Also in this case only variations below \(\pm\)0.2% in the total visible energy are found over the polar angle range considered. As mentioned above, these variations are due to the non-sensitive liquid argon between the individual absorber elements [3].

Bigger effects are however found for different impact positions in the y-direction. The variations in the total visible energy in the calorimeter are shown in Fig. 6. They are found to reflect the distribution of the dead zones in the sensitive liquid argon gaps due to the feed-throughs and rivets. Over the entire y-range the variations do however not exceed \(\pm\)0.8%.

Design Parameters of the End-Cap Calorimeter

### Electron Reconstruction

In the end-cap region of the \(\Lambda\)TLAS detector the electron reconstruction is more complex than in the barrel region. The pile-up contributions are larger and they depend on the rapidity. Also a given matrix of constant \(\Delta\eta\times\Delta\varphi\) bins corresponds to areas of different geometrical size at different rapidities. In order to optimize the electron reconstruction in the end-caps the energy resolution has been studied as a function of cluster size and transverse granularity at different rapidities. The present simulation has been performed with the TGT structure implemented in the ATLAS detector framework, assuming the version B of the tracking detector as presented in the Letter of Intent [4]. The electronic noise assumed is based on the calculation presented in Ref. [2]. Minimum bias pile-up was generated with the Monte Carlo programme PYTHIA for a luminosity of \(2.5\ 10^{34}cm^{-2}sec^{-1}\).

The results for the energy resolution are shown for 70 GeV and 500 GeV electrons in Figs. 7 and 8 as a function of the cluster size for different transverse granularities for the rapidity values \(\eta=2.0\) and \(\eta=2.7\) respectively. Due to the large pile-up contributions the optimum for the resolution is found for rather small cluster sizes around values of \(\Delta\eta\times\Delta\varphi=0.10\times 0.10\) at both rapidity values considered. It should however be kept in mind that this corresponds to different geometrical sizes at different rapidity values. In addition it should be noted that the optimal cluster size depends weakly on the energy. Since lower energy electrons (\(E\sim 40\) GeV) are more sensitive to pile-up, smaller cluster sizes are preferred in order to keep the pile-up contributions small [5]. Since the relevant physics quantity is the transverse energy, higher energy electrons are more important and therefore we suggest to use a cluster size of \(\Delta\eta\times\Delta\varphi=0.10\times 0.10\) as an energy and rapidity independent approximation.

The next question is how this cluster size has to be subdivided into into smaller cells. From the Figs. 7 and 8 it can be seen that there is no significant difference in the resolution if the basic cell granularity is varied in the range between \(\Delta\eta\times\Delta\varphi=0.02\times 0.02\ (5\times 5\) cells) and \(0.03\times 0.03\ (3\times 3\) cells). For the high rapidity region (\(\eta\sim 2.7\)) one can even go up to a granularity of \(\Delta\eta\times\Delta\varphi=0.05\times 0.05\) without degrading the resolution. At low energies, where pile-up is relatively important it is sufficient to work with clusters of \(2\times 2\) cells, whereas at the high energy side one can afford to collect the energy over a region of \(3\times 3\) cells.

The resolution curves as a function of energy are shown in Fig. 9 for the various cluster sizes considered.

To conclude: A cluster size of \(\Delta\eta\times\Delta\varphi=0.10\times 0.10\) can be used for the electron energy reconstruction in the whole end-cap region. The proposed transverse granularity of the TGT calorimeter of \(\Delta\eta\times\Delta\varphi=0.025\times 0.025\) for \(\eta<2.3\) and \(\Delta\eta\times\Delta\varphi=0.05\times 0.05\) for \(\eta>2.3\) seems to be adequate to perform an optimal electron reconstruction; in the region \(\eta<2.3\) one can even work with a coarser granularity of \(\Delta\eta\times\Delta\varphi=0.03\times 0.03\) without degrading the energy resolution too much.

More detailed information, beyond the summary given here, can be found in Ref. [5].

### Calorimeter Thickness

For the measurement of high energetic electromagnetic showers the calorimeter has to be thick enough in order not to introduce a constant term in the energy resolution. The energy resolution has been studied for 2 TeV electrons as a function of the calorimeter thickness. The results are contained in Ref. [6] and only the main points will be repeated here. In Fig. 10 the energy resolution for the 2 TeV electrons is shown as a function of the calorimeter thickness. given in units of radiation lengths. It has to be noted that in the simulation performed 1.5 additional radiation lengths have been assumed in front of the calorimeter. As can be seen from this figure, the energy resolution improves with increasing calorimeter thickness, up to a thickness corresponding to 32 \(X_{0}\)'s. In Fig. 11 the quantity \((\sigma/E\sqrt{E})^{2}\) is shown as a function of the electron energy in the range between 10 GeV and 2 TeV. A constant term in the energy resolution would show up as a positive slope in this plot. For a calorimeter with a thickness corresponding to 27 \(X_{0}\) there is no indication of such a term in the energy range up to 500 GeV. The resolution can be described by a sampling term of \(9.6\pm 0.2\%\) alone (dashed line). However, due to the significant leakage effects the energy resolution at 2 TeV cannot be described by this parametrization. There are two ways to improve this situation:

* to build a thicker calorimeter and collect the energy in \(\thicksim 32X_{0}\)
* to have an independent, rather short compartment at the end of the electromagnetic calorimeter; in this case the energy seen in this compartment can be weighted in order to correct for longitudinal leakage [6].

To summarize: For a calorimeter with an equivalent thickness of 27 \(X_{0}\) an additional contribution to the constant term in the energy resolution of \(\thicksim 0.15\) % is introduced by longitudinal leakage. This contribution can either be suppressed by having a thicker calorimeter or by having an independent compartment at the end of the electromagnetic calorimeter. such that energy corrections can be applied. Due to the large flexibility in the longitudinal segmentation the last point can easily be fulfilled in the TGT design.

## 4 Performance of the TGT End-Cap Module

### Study of the \(\gamma\)-Cracks

Owing to the 16-fold modular structure of the TGT end-cap calorimeter [7] the excellent intrinsic uniformity is somewhat distorted in the \(\gamma\)-cracks between the modules. According to the current technical design the dimensions of these cracks can be kept at the level of \(\sim 1\) mm. In order to estimate their effect on the uniformity, detailed simulations have been performed and the response and the resolution have been studied for electrons. In absence of an exact knowledge of the amount of material in front of the calorimeter, the simulation has been performed by assuming material corresponding to 1.5 \(X_{0}\) and 3.0 \(X_{0}\) in front of the calorimeter. Since the exact material distribution in the \(\gamma\)-cracks is also not yet known in detail, two extremes have been considered: (a) having a pointing crack of 1 mm with only non-sensitive liquid argon as material, (b) replacing the liquid argon by stainless steel. Details on all these studies can be found in Ref. [8] and again only the main results will be summarized.

Results of scans with 100 GeV electrons across the crack are shown in Fig. 12 for the signal response and in Fig. 13 for the resolution for the crack filled with liquid argon and for the two assumptions on the amount of material in front of the calorimeter. It should be noted, that due to the deflection of the electrons in the magnetic field the crack appears shifted by \(\sim 11\) mrad from the nominal position at \(\varphi=0\). The response in the various impact points is normalized to the response in the center of the module (\(E_{0}\)), which is not affected by the cracks. For electrons entering the crack the response of the electromagnetic calorimeter drops drastically to values between 55% and 77% depending on the amount of material in front of the calorimeter. However only an extremly small region is affected by this non-uniformity: Outside of \(\pm\) 5 mrad around the crack the response is found to be above 99%. Also the resolution is distorted in the crack region. However one should keep in mind, that in the actual simulation only the information of the electromagnetic calorimeter is used and no energies deposited in the hadron calorimeter are taken into account. A non-alignment of the cracks of the hadronic calorimeter with the ones of the electromagnetic calorimeter ensures that energies leaking out of the electromagnetic calorimeter are measured in the hadronic calorimeter. In this case the only price to pay for the pointing \(\varphi\) crack is a very small loss in acceptance for electrons and photons since fiducial cuts around the cracks must be applied for a reliable electron identification. It should be noted, that the exclusion of regions of \(\pm 0.5\) cm, which corresponds to \(\pm 5\) mrad at the radius where the present simulation is performed, the loss in acceptance would be at the level of 2.5%.

In Fig. 14 the response is compared for the two assumptions of the material in the crack, liquid argon or iron for the case of having material corresponding to 3.0 \(X_{0}\) in front of the calorimeter. The corresponding resolution curve is shown in Fig. 15. A few significant differences compared to the previous situation can be seen. In the case of dense material in the crack, the response is affected over a larger region due to the larger losses of energy in the non-sensitive material in the crack. The maximal drop in response is found to be similar as in the previous case. On the other hand, the resolution for electrons in the electromagnetic calorimeter alone is improved significantly, since in the case of material in the crack it is guaranteed that the total electromagnetic shower is contained in the electromagneticcalorimeter.

A quantitative comparison between the three scenarios considered is presented in Tab. 1, where the response in the crack, the resolution in the crack and the level of uniformity is given. The level of uniformity is defined as the response at \(\varphi=\varphi_{crack}\pm 5\) mrad.

The results obtained show that the \(\varphi\)-cracks in the TGT end-cap design are not a serious problem. Concerning the electron reconstruction one of the following possibilities can be adapted:

* trying to keep the amount of material in the crack as low as possible and to apply fiducial cuts in the way described above.
* in the case of material in the crack, the response and the resolution have a smooth behaviour and it might even be possible to work without any fiducial cuts. In this case the non-uniformity can probably be corrected and only a degradation of the resolution remains.
* in addition it can be tried to tilt the individual modules, so that the cracks are non-projective.

\begin{tabular}{|c||c|c|c|} \hline Variable & LAr crack, & LAr crack, & Iron crack, \\  & 1.5 \(X_{0}\) & 3 \(X_{0}\) & 3 \(X_{0}\) \\ \hline \(\frac{<E_{crack}>}{<E_{0}>}\) (\%) & 55.3 \(\pm\) 1.2 & 77.3 \(\pm\) 1.1 & 75.6 \(\pm\) 0.1 \\ \hline \((\frac{R.M.S.}{<E>})_{crack}\) & 0.212 & 0.137 & 0.017 \\ \hline \(\frac{<E>}{<E_{0}>}\) (\%) & 98.9 \(\pm\) 0.1 & 99.0 \(\pm\) 0.2 & 95.8 \(\pm\) 0.2 \\ \hline \end{tabular}

### Photon Direction Measurement

Due to the uncertainties in the z-position of the interaction point at LHC a precise stand-alone \(\theta\)-measurement of the photon direction in the calorimeter is important. The measurement of the photon direction is based on the measurements of the cluster centroids in the various calorimeter compartments and in the strip detector.

Photons of 40 and 100 GeV have been simulated in the TGT calorimeter with a five-fold longitudinal segmentation (2.4, 2.4, 9.8, 9.8, 2.4 \(X_{0}\)). The impact points have been smeared over the whole surface of an individual cell. The reconstruction of the \(\gamma\)-direction proceeds in the following steps:

* computing the average shower position in each compartment
* reconstructing the \(\theta\)-coordinate in each compartment by a center of gravity method, i.e. weighting neighbouring cells according to their energy
* unfolding the systematic bias between the measured and the true \(\theta\)-value (arc-tan function)
* performing a straight line fit, where the measurements in the individual compartments and of the strip detector are weighted according to their \(\theta\)-resolution The results obtained for the resolution on the \(\gamma\)-direction measurement are presented in Tab. 2 for various scenarios. More details can be found in Ref. [9].

From these results it can be concluded that the design goal of \(\Delta\theta=40\)\(\mathrm{mrad}/\sqrt{E}\) can be achieved with the proposed layout. In addition it should be noted that in case the strip detector is included the precision is determined from the information in the strip detector itself and from the information in the two big blocks in the center of the calorimeter. The other compartments do not improve the \(\gamma\)-direction measurement significantly.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|} \hline Configuration & \(\Delta\theta\) (mrad) & \(\Delta\theta\) (mrad) \\  & 40 GeV & 100 GeV \\ \hline
5 compartments & 13.5 \(\pm\) 0.4 & 7.3 \(\pm\) 0.2 \\ no strips, no noise & & \\
5 compartments & 6.5 \(\pm\) 0.3 & 3.8 \(\pm\) 0.1 \\ incl. strips, no noise & & \\

\end{table}

### \(\gamma/\pi^{0}\) Separation

A good \(\gamma/\pi^{0}\) separation in a strip detector is essential for the efficient rejection of jets faking the photon signature. As shown in Ref.[4], a rejection factor of \(\sim 3\) against \(\pi^{0}\)'s is needed to suppress the jet background well below the irreducible \(\gamma\gamma\)-background in the search for the \(H\to\gamma\gamma\) signal.

The aim of the present study is to demonstrate that such a rejection can be obtained with the proposed layout of the strip detector in the TGT end-cap design, taking the realistic geometry, electronic noise and pile-up into account.

The geometry of the proposed strip detector has been described in detail elsewhere [4]. Only the main features of the layout will be repeated; the strip detector is placed in the second absorber element of the TGT module, where the usual pads are simply replaced by strips. One of the pad boards is assumed to have \(\theta\) strips (\(0.53\times 6.0cm^{2}\)) while two others carry \(\varphi\) strips (individual strip width of \(0.75\times 4.25cm^{2}\)). In the proposed geometry every second \(\varphi\) strip is fed into the same readout channel, thereby creating a "double-comb" structure. The third pad board in the absorber element is assumed to have a similar structure in \(\varphi\), but shifted by half a \(\varphi\)-strip width.

The \(\gamma/\pi^{0}\)-separation has been determined for the following scenarios:

* the strip detector is described by individual strips in \(\theta\) and \(\varphi\)
* the proposed "comb-structure" in \(\varphi\) is simulated in order to demonstrate that the degradation of the rejection due to the summing of the \(\varphi\) channels is small
* electronic noise is added; the level is assumed to be 0.2 MeV of visible energy per strip
* pile-up noise according to a luminosity of \(2.5\ 10^{34}cm^{-2}sec^{-1}\) is taken into account at a rapidity value of \(\eta=2.0\)

For the current study a neural network approach has been used to determine the \(\gamma\)-efficiency and the \(\pi^{0}\)-rejection. Compared to more conventional methods, like for example using the widths \(\sigma_{x}\) and \(\sigma_{y}\) of the lateral shower distribution [1], this method gave by far the best \(\pi^{0}\)-rejection, which was typically a factor of two better than the one obtained by using other methods.

The network is a feed-forward network with 24 nodes in the input layer, 40 nodes in the hidden layers and one output-node, on which the discrimination is done. During the training the weights are updated by a back-propagation learning algorithm with a decreasing learning rate. For the training 1000 \(\gamma\)'s and \(\pi^{0}\)'s each at 40, 70, and 100 GeV have been generated. As input quantities for the 24 input nodes the energies from the individual strips are used. In the case of the comb-structure the combined input is fed into several input nodes; this guarantees that the same network architecture can be used. After typically 1000 cycles the training was stopped, the weights were fixed and the separation of \(\gamma\)'s and \(\pi^{0}\)'s was achieved by some appropriate cuts in the output-node distributions, which are shown for illustration in Fig. 16 a) for photons and b) for \(\pi^{0}\)'s. More detailed information about this topic can be found in Ref.[10].

### e/\(\pi\) Separation

Since charged hadrons represent the most important contribution to the fake electron rate at LHC, the calorimeter should provide a good e/\(\pi\) separation for an independent and redundant electron identification. It has been shown [11] that for a good e/\(\pi\) separation a good transverse granularity, the measurement of the hadronic leakage energy and the measurement of the energy in the first calorimeter layers (preshower detector) are important. In addition, a fine longitudinal segmentation in the first few radiation lengths improves the separation power since information on the slope of the early shower development is available. If the hadronic calorimeter cannot be used to measure small energy deposits behind the electromagnetic cluster, a short compartment at the back of the electromagnetic calorimeter can take over the role of the hadronic calorimeter and the loss in rejection power can be partially recovered. The proposed TGT design with the fine longitudinal segmentation does provide the potential needed for a good e/\(\pi\) separation. The first compartment (\(2.4X_{0}\)) can act as a preshower detector, together with the second compartment the early shower shape can be measured, the last compartment can be used to provide information about the longitudinal energy leakage. It should be stressed that all these features can be obtained with the proposed calorimeter design, without the necessity of constructing independent preshower devices in front of the calorimeter.

The results on the e/\(\pi\) separation obtained for the TGT design under real LHC conditions are shown in Fig.17. If the calorimeter rejection is combined with the p/E constraint, the rejection is found to vary between \(\sim\) 200 at 20 GeV and \(\sim\) 1300 at 100 GeV for an electron efficiency of 90 %. Concerning the global electron identification at LHC, this rejection seems to be adequate to bring the background from jets faking electrons at the same level or even below the level of genuine isolated electrons.

Conclusions

The simulation studies presented in this note have shown that the TGT calorimeter is well suited to achieve the design goals necessary for the operation in a LHC detector. Its particularly strong points are the good homogeneity of the signal response over the total rapidity range, thereby minimizing the contributions to the constant term in the energy resolution, and its flexible longitudinal segmentation. This segmentation is useful in the \(\mathrm{e}/\pi\) separation and for the reconstruction of high energetic showers by weighting the energy in the last electromagnetic compartment. It also makes it possible to incorporate the preshower and the strip detector in the calorimeter structure, instead of building an independent device which is positioned in front of the calorimeter. Concerning the strip detector it has been demonstrated, that the performance which can be achieved with the proposed layout is sufficient for a good \(\gamma/\pi^{0}\) separation and is well above the design goals as specified from the physics requirements.

The \(\varphi\)-cracks, which arise from the 16-fold modular structure, do not affect seriously the overall performance. In the case of pointing cracks fiducial cuts can be applied which, given the present estimate of the thickness of the crack, only lead to a small loss in acceptance. Another possibility is to make the cracks non-projective by tilting the individual modules.
