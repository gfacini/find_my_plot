## 1 Introduction

In this paper some details of the realization of the TGT concept for the electromagnetic LAr end-cap calorimeter are discussed. It is meant to be more a status report of ongoing design studies rather than a full description of the TGT concept.

## 2 Design Guidelines

In the end-cap region the emphasis for the calorimeter performance in terms of energy resolution, angular resolution and \(\gamma\) / \(\pi^{\circ}\) separation is mainly on high energy \(\gamma\)'s and electrons. Therefore the constant term in the energy resolution becomes increasingly important relative to the sampling term. For the mechanical design the homogeneity of the response has therefore even a higher priority than in the barrel region. In particular any variation of the sampling fraction due to different amounts of absorber material in front of the calorimeter has to be kept at a minimum. Although such effects can be corrected using Monte Carlo information in combination with the presampler response, experience shows that the stronger the variation the larger is the residual constant term in the energy resolution. Therefore the main guideline for the design of the electromagnetic end-cap calorimeter was the request to keep the front plane free of any support structures and thus to minimize sampling fraction variations. A further request was to minimize zones of dead material in \(r\) as well as in \(\varphi\).

Second highest priority was given to the request for a modular system. The basic units are individual absorber elements (ABE's), equipped with the preamplifier and calibration electronics. These units can be individually tested before installation and - if necessary - be exchanged individually at any time during the assembly process.

## 3 Mechanical Structure

The end-cap module is assembled from individual sectors. The lay-out is completely symmetric in \(\varphi\), the basic segmentation in \(\varphi\) being 16-fold (see Fig. 1). The 16 mechanically independent sectors are pre-assembled individually and then connected to form the total wheel. For the assembly of the wheel the two neighbouring \(\varphi\)-rods of two sectors are boltedFigure 1: Basic segmentation in \(r-\varphi\) and orientation of the individual absorber elements (ABE’s) in \(r-z\).

together. The mechanical stability of the full end-cap module is ensured by the barrel type frame structure made from individual steel bars which are located at the rear plane (transition to the hadronic calorimeter). The weight of the total wheel is \(\thicksim\) 45 t.

### Individual Sector

A sector consists of two elements: the frame and the absorber elements. The perspective view of the steel frame of one individual sector is shown in Fig. 2. The steel structure has a cross section of \(100\times 35\ mm^{2}\). The absorber elements are mounted on the steel frame and held in place only from the back. The positioning of individual absorber elements is shown in Fig. 3 and in detail in Fig. 4. A comb structure made of Aluminum (fixed to the steel rods) defines the appropriate angle for a given absorber element. The two outer steel plates of one absorber element are extended by \(\thicksim 70\ mm\) in the region of the comb structure and reinforced by an Al wedge in the free space between the two plates. The absorber element is fixed with screws to the comb structure. The free space between the steel bars in \(\varphi\) is used for connectors (connection to summing boards). The summing and merging boards (SMB's) are located at the back plane of the end-cap calorimeter (see Fig. 3). The connectors are positioned in a double row in the free space between the two multi-layer-boards (MLB) of neighbouring absorber elements (see Fig. 5).

The non-active space between two sectors, i.e. between two neighbouring absorber elements in \(\varphi\), is given by the tolerances of the positioning only. In particular there is no additional material (e.g. cables, mechanical support) in this region. To reduce the otherwise unavoidable effect of the given thickness of one absorber element on this space in \(\varphi\), the individual boards and plates combined in one absorber element are cut to the exact size as given by the individual position. Thus the nonactive space in \(\varphi\) is minimized (see Fig. 6). In the \(\varphi\)-center it is pure LAr and the standard sampling ratio is reached at 0.6 mm from the \(\varphi\)-center. Any inhomogeneity in \(\varphi\) is thus limited to a space of maximal 2 \(\times\) 0.6 mm between neighbouring absorber elements in \(\varphi\).

### "Central Plug"

At small radii, i.e. at large \(\eta\), the absorber elements are rather small. In addition, the length of the individual absorber elements is decreasing drastically, the acceptable limit being presently 200 \(mm\). Also for these absorber elements the comb structure has to be extended from the backplane to the inner cylinder. Therefore the innermost absorber elements are assembled and installed as one unit in the wheel, the so called "central plug". The Fig. 7 shows the support cylinder and the corresponding two comb structures at the back plane and the inner cylinder. The total weight (less than 2 \(t\)) is transferred via a 20 mm thick steel cylinder to the calorimeter wheel. This cylinder is screwed as one unit to the rods of the calorimeter wheel.

### Total End-Cap Wheel

The steel frame of the total calorimeter wheel without the central plug is shown for the \(r-\varphi\) view and the \(r-z\) view in Fig. 8. The weight of the wheel is assumed to be transferred to Figure 2: Perspective view of the steel frame of one individual sector.

two rails fixed to the cryostat wall. In addition, to reduce any vertical bending, there are 16 fixations in z with respect to the cryostat (allowing still free movement in \(r-\varphi\)). Thus a rather small torque is transferred to the cryostat.

Assuming a steel rod cross section of \(100\times 54\ mm^{2}\), which is actually 30% smaller than the one of the present design (\(2\times 35\times 100\ mm^{2}\)), FEM calculations have been carried out to estimate the stresses, strains and deformations. The Fig. 9 shows the distribution of the stresses and strains in the wheel structure. The maximum stress is 20 \(N/mm^{2}\), a factor of 10 below any critical limit. The deformations of the wheel structure (strongly magnified) are shown in Fig. 10: the maximum deformation is 0.2 \(mm\) in \(z\). The maximum movement of one absorber element due to the bending of the steel rods is 0.1 \(mm\). In addition, assuming the support of one absorber element to be at the very end only (and not along the 100 \(mm\) length of the comb structure) adds 0.2 \(mm\) of bending at the free end of the absorber element. In conclusion, the present design yields an upper limit of 0.2 \(mm\) for any displacement or deformation of absorber elements in the end-cap calorimeter and allows for further material reduction.

### Assembly and Tests

A possible scenario is: The individual absorber elements, with average size \(0.4\times 0.5\ m^{2}\), are assembled and fully tested (mechanics, HV and electronics) at the home lab. Using these tested absorber elements one sector (i.e. 1/16 of the wheel) is assembled. A cold test in a test-cryostat will be done in the home lab. Again, the tests include HV tests, and tests of the full electronic chain and calibration system. The tested sectors will be finally transported to CERN and there the full wheel will be assembled. Finally, a cold test of the full wheel at CERN is foreseen. It should be stressed again that any faulty absorber element can be exchanged at any time during the full assembly.

## 4 Lateral and Longitudinal Granularity

The impact of the lateral and longitudinal segmentation on the expected performance of the TGT calorimeter has been studied in detail in [1]. The chosen granularity is motivated partly by these findings. Constant bins in \(\eta\) and \(\varphi\) (\(\Delta\eta\times\Delta\varphi=0.05\times 0.05\) up to \(r\ =\ 800\ mm\) and \(\Delta\eta\times\Delta\varphi=0.025\times 0.025\) beyond) are directly projected onto the individual read-out boards (absorber elements), providing the exact pads in \(\eta\) and \(\varphi\) space. The total number of absorber elements per sector is 74, the number of \(\eta\)-bins is 46 (see Table 1 and Fig. 11). Strips are assumed to be in the region \(r\ \geq\ 800\ mm\) only, the equivalent width in \(\theta\) being 2.5 mm and extending in \(\varphi\) for \(\Delta\varphi=0.1\), and in \(\varphi\) the resolution is \(\Delta\varphi=0.003\) and extending over \(\sim 15\ mm\) in \(\theta\). Assuming a 5-fold longitudinal segmentation (i.e. (1, 1, 8, 8, 2) \(\times 1.26\ X_{\rm a}\)), where the first segment is used as preshower and the second will contain the strip channels, we obtain for one end-cap module the number of preamps and read-out channels as given in Table 2. Of course, these numbers would decrease correspondingly when less samplings in depth and/or a coarser \(\Delta\eta\) and \(\Delta\varphi\) segmentation would be chosen (see also [1]).

Conclusion

The TGT calorimeter concept is well suited for the end-cap region. The homogeneity of the response, the \(\varphi\) symmetry and a high degree of modularity are realized in a straightforward and simple mechanical design, which has the potential to be very cost effective.
