## 1 Introduction and motivation

This note reports the results of two different studies by the NIU ATLAS group on the fluences of low energy gammas and neutrons in the muon chambers. The first looks at the effect of varying the carbon content of the shielding iron. The motivation for this study was the fact that pure iron allows neutrons of about 25 keV to pass through relatively unimpeded, due to the nuclear cross section; additions of small amounts of carbon absorb these neutrons but result in lower strength and density of the steel as the amount of carbon increases. We therefore looked at the effect of adding (by volume) 2% and 4% of carbon, compared to the baseline of pure iron, and find that there is a substantial decrease of neutron fluence (about a factor of 2) in going to 2% carbon from none, but that going to 4% results in little additional improvement.

In the second study, we look at the effect of replacing the baseline polyethylene - lead sandwich with heavy concrete (density 3.58, containing lead, lithium fluoride, and polyethylene). The motivation for using this material is that it is nonflammable and structurally advantageous; we find that it reduces the fluences of gammas by about 20% everywhere, compared to the baseline. We expect that it may prove to be inexpensive as well; we are currently researching the cost and availability of this and similar materials with our Russian colleagues.

## 2 Codes used, generation of events

We used events generated by the DTUJET code of Johannes Ranft[1], with proton - proton collisions at 14 TeV. DTUJET is optimized to reproduce observed \(p_{t}\) distributions at very large \(|\eta|\); this is crucial for these types of studies, as these are the particles which are the parents of the low energy gammas and neutrons. The secondary particles produced by these events are then propagated through the ATLAS detector using ATLSIM[2], and then cascaded to energies of 0.001 eV (neutrons) and 10 keV (gammas, electrons) using GCALOR[3]. Each data set consists of 80 events.

Baseline Geometry, and variations

The baseline geometry we used was the Technical Design Report geometry, with the baseline beampipe. We used the standard geometry modules atftogo.g (overall ATLAS geometry) and pipageo.g (official beam pipe), and our own modules shldgeo.g (shielding) and ecftgeo.g (end cap toroid). The shielding downstream of the endcap toroids is iron surrounded by lithium-loaded polyethylene and lead. This geometry is referred to as set101. The variations we considered are as follows: set 103, with 2% carbon, by volume, in the iron; set 104, with 4% carbon; and set 105, with concrete replacing the polyethylene and lead. In all cases the steel (iron plus carbon) has a density of 7.5; the concrete has the same shape as the polyethylene and lead it replaces. The composition of the concrete is the following, by weight: H(0.019), Li(0.026), C(0.100), F(0.071), O(0.115), Al(0.019), Si(0.003), Ca(0.016), and Pb(0.631). The same original 80 events were simulated for each of the shielding configurations; this should minimize differences due to fluctuations in the initial fragmentation. Figure 1 shows the geometry used.

## 4 Results and discussion

The results are presented in sets of six plots, three versus \(z\) at fixed \(R\), and three at fixed \(R\) versus \(z\). The \(R\) values are 475, 720, and 1050 cm, approximately the positions of the inner, middle, and outer barrel chambers. The \(z\) values are 700, 1325, and 2100 cm, approximately the positions of the inner, middle, and outer endcap chambers. The inner boundaries of the endcap chambers are at \(R=91\) (CSC), \(R=212\) (inner MDT), \(R=173\) (middle MDT), and \(R=293\) (outer MDT). The figures have both the baseline (dashed) and comparison (solid) neutron and gamma fluences: Figure 2, 2% carbon vs baseline; Figure 3, 4% carbon vs baseline; Figure 4, heavy concrete vs baseline.

It can be seen that 2% carbon gives an improvement of about a factor of two in both the neutron and gamma fluences; the 4% carbon and 2% carbon results, however, are practically indistinguishable. In addition, the density of the steel will decrease as more and more carbon is added; we have not taken this effect into account, but it would tend to negate any improvements due to larger amounts of carbon. From this we conclude that a small addition of carbon would be favorable in terms of the expected neutron and gamma backgrounds; larger amounts (such as 5%) do not appear to be necessary.

The heavy concrete also gives an improvement over the baseline of about 20% in the gamma fluence, while making little difference in the neutron fluence. This is a particularly interesting result, as this concrete would be a reasonable structural material as well as being nonflammable. Improvements in the gamma fluence are most helpful, as the rate in the detectors is dominated by gammas.

These results indicate, first, that a small (2% by volume) carbon content in the iron reduces the neutron, and therefore the gamma, fluence at the positions of the muon chambers. In addition, a new material, heavy concrete, has been investigated and looks promising. We will continue to study this material, and to determine its cost, availability, and mechanical properties, and also to study the effect of using both the iron with carbon and the concrete.
