# Report of the ATLAS Calorimeter Review Panel

August 24, 1993

###### Abstract

The panel had the task of recommending the choice of technologies for the ATLAS calorimeters within the possibilities outlined in section 1.2. The working procedure adopted is described in section 1.3 and the options considered in 1.4. Although a full liquid argon solution was judged to be too expensive at an early stage in the discussions, this option is presented for comparison in section 2 which concerns the barrel. The end caps are discussed in section 3, costs and manpower in section 4, and the remaining parts deal with the conclusions and recommendations. The possible use of liquid krypton is mentioned in section 6.

A large amount of additional information was provided by the expert members during the meetings of the panel. The quality and scope of this information was impressive for all three techniques, and represents a lot of work by the experts and others.

The conclusions and recommendations are the responsibility of the in dependent members who in the rest of this document will be referred to as 'the panel'.

The panel met on seven occasions occupying 10 days during March to July 1993.

### The Panel Membership

The panel consists of five independent members - T Akesson, J D Dowell (Chairman), N N Ellis, P R Norton and R Voss; six experts - D Fournier, B Mansoulie (Accordion); H Oberlack, P Schacht (TGT); M Nessi, F Vazeille (Scintillator Tiles); and the two spokesmen F Dydak, P Jenni (ex-officio).

### The Charge to the Panel

#### 1.2.1 Decisions to be taken

Which of the two Liquid Argon options (Accordion, TGT) shall become the baseline option of the end cap electromagnetic and/or hadronic calorimeter? Shall a full Liquid Argon calorimeter or a hybrid version (Liquid Argon/ plastic scintillator) be retained as baseline option? In case a hybrid calorimeter is retained: what is the optimum boundary between Liquid Argon and scintillator calorimetry and should it be different in the barrel and in the end caps?

#### 1.2.2 Timescale

Recommendation to the Plenary Meeting not later than July 1993. Decision by the Collaboration Board as soon as possible thereafter.

#### 1.2.3 Charge to the panel

1. To collect and evaluate all relevant information. The evaluation shall include physics requirements, performance, technical feasibility, operational reliability, cost and sufficient laboratory support for the construction, tests, and installation.
2. To present to the Plenary Meeting a recommendation on which choices are to be made.

### Working Procedure

The Panel first received documentation on the work already carried out, as well as proposed activities within the context of the DRDC projects RD3, RD33 and RD34 and reviewed the criteria that had to be met for the ATLAS detector proposal. A series of questions and criticisms of each technique were raised by independent and expert members and answered in subsequent meetings. A cost and manpower study was also made. The panel was guided by the need to minimize the cost of the calorimeter while satisfying the ATLAS physics requirements and technical reliability. The availability of resources was not explicitly taken into account, but the panel was confident that the technical strength of the proponents of each of the three techniques was sufficient to provide the necessary leadership. It was assumed that the overall resources required could be found within the ATLAS collaboration as a whole. The conclusions are therefore based on scientific, technical and cost evaluations.

### The Options

Three options were considered for the barrel calorimeter:

1. full liquid argon,
2. liquid argon electromagnetic calorimeter with scintillating tiles hadronic calorimeter (the '2m' or 'full hybrid' solution),
3. the first three hadronic absorption lengths in liquid argon and the remainder in tiles (the '3m' or 'intermediate' solution).

The accordion technique had already been adopted as the baseline option for the liquid argon barrel calorimeter.

For the end caps, the accordion and TGT approaches were studied in detail for the electromagnetic part. Although initially tiles were considered for the hadronic part, this option was rejected early in the panel discussions because of the sensitivity to radiation damage. The design of the liquid argon hadronic section was not studied in detail, but a preliminary cost estimate was made assuming flat absorber plates.

A further choice that was agreed at an early stage was that the barrel hadronic calorimetry should be extended into the end cap regions so that the end cap calorimeters become end-plugs, thus minimizing their cost. The choice of liquid argon for the end cap hadron calorimeter and the end-plug concept were presented to the collaboration in April 1993.

## 2 The Barrel Calorimeter

### Design Features of the Liquid Argon Barrel Hadron Calorimeter Option

The design of the liquid argon barrel section is described in detail in the Letter of Intent [1], section 2.3. The readout of the hadronic part employs the electrostatic transformer (EST) technique in which gaps are connected in series. Table 1 summarises the basic parameters of the full liquid argon and '3m' options, where the readout refers only to the hadronic part. For comparison, the number of electromagnetic channels is 75700 for the calorimeter, and 184400 for the preshower detector.

### Design Features of the Tile Hadron Calorimeter Options

The basic design is described in the Letter of Intent [1], section 2.4, and in a proposal to the DRDC[2]. The layout of the '2m' and '3m' versions is shown in Figures 1 and 2, and Figure 3 shows more detail of the tile calorimeter. Table 2 summarises the parameters of the two options for the tile section, assuming the same granularity in both cases. It has been suggested that, in the '3m' solution, the \(\Delta\eta\) granularity could possibly be reduced also for the inner sampling. The radial thicknesses quoted for the liquid argon section include the superconducting coil and the cold and warm cryostat walls which are each 2 cm thick stainless steel. For each tile module, which covers 0.1 in \(\phi\), the active part of the hadron calorimeter is followed by a structural support element made of iron which also houses the photomultipliers and front-end electronics, and acts as the flux return for the solenoidal field (Figure 4).

An important difference between the '2m' and '3m' solutions is that the H1-like cryogenic signal feedthroughs cannot be used for the '2m' case because of lack of space. An alternative solution has therefore to be developed with a higher density of feedthroughs per unit area. A 50 cm \(\times\) 50 cm annular region has been allocated, in the Saclay engineering design, at each end of the cryostat to accommodate feedthroughs and other connections.

### Performance Comparisons

#### 2.3.1 Full Liquid Argon

The performance of a full liquid argon electromagnetic and hadronic prototype has been measured in the test beam. The features are similar but not identical to the ATLAS design (10 mm plates instead of 12 mm). The energy resolution obtained for pions, using a weighting technique, is:

\(\sigma(E)/E=40\%/\surd E\,+\,2.2\%\) (linear sum)

\(\sigma(E)/E=49\%/\surd E\oplus\,3.5\%\) (quadratic sum)

The results are in agreement with Monte Carlo simulations using the GHEISHA and FLUKA codes. The electronics noise is dominated by the contribution from the electromagnetic section and would be about 3 GeV in a cone of \(\Delta R=0.4\). The resolution for jets in a full depth ATLAS calorimeter is expected to be:

\(\sigma(E)/E=30\%/\surd E\oplus\,2\%\)

to be compared to the ATLAS physics requirement [1] of \(50\%/\surd E\oplus 3\%\). The improvement for jets is because the neutral electromagnetic component is detected with higher accuracy in the electromagnetic calorimeter.

The rejection of pions faking electrons has also been measured giving 790\(\pm\)310 at 50 GeV to be compared to a requirement of about 500 for energies above 50 GeV. The result is limited by statistics.

#### 2.3.2 '3m' Solution

The '3m' calorimeter is identical to the full liquid argon one up to 5.3 \(\lambda\) and is thus expected to have a very similar performance for energy resolution and pion rejection.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|} \hline
**Mechanics** & **‘2m’** & **‘3m’** \\ \hline Inner radius (mm) & 2250 & 3030 \\ \hline Outer radius (mm) & 4200 & 4200 \\ \hline Length of central part (mm) & 5900 & 5900 \\ \hline Length of extended barrel (mm) & 2 \(\times\) 2700 & 2\(\times\) 2700 \\ \hline Total thickness of LAr section (\(\lambda\)) & 2.0 & 5.8 \\ \hline Total thickness to end of active part (\(\lambda\)) & 9.7 & 9.1 \\ \hline Total thickness of absorber (\(\lambda\)) & 10.8 & 10.2 \\ \hline Total weight of tile section (tonnes) & 1280 & 864 \\ \hline Weight of one module (tonnes) & 20 & 13.5 \\ \hline
**Read-out** & & \\ \hline Samplings in depth & 3 & 2 \\ \hline Granularity of inner sampling(s) (\(\Delta\eta\times\Delta\phi\)) & \(.1\times.1\) & \(.1\times.1\) \\ \hline Granularity of last sampling (\(\Delta\eta\times\Delta\phi\)) & \(.2\times.1\) & \(.2\times.1\) \\ \hline Total number of readout cells (2 pms per cell) & 4900 & 2665 \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 2: Basic parameters of the tile hadron calorimeter options

#### 2.3.3 '2m' Solution

Test beam results are also available for a bare tile scintillator hadronic prototype (i.e. without an electromagnetic calorimeter in front) between 20 GeV and 300 GeV. Without cuts or weighting the observed resolution is (Figure 5):

\[\sigma(E)/E=\,51\,\%/\sqrt{E}\,+\,2.6\%\]

to be compared to a Monte Carlo calculation using the FLUKA code of \(4\,5\%/\sqrt{E}\,+\,4\,\%\). The same code yields a jet energy resolution in ATLAS of:

\[\sigma(E)/E=\,30\%/\sqrt{E}\,+\,1.5\%\]

which is comparable to the other two cases considered and better than the ATLAS requirement (Figure 6).

The granularity of the tile hadronic calorimeter (0.1 \(\times\) 0.1) is worse than that for liquid argon (0.05 \(\times\) 0.05). As noted in the Letter of Intent [1], section 8.2.3, the better granularity would increase the efficiency of W \(\rightarrow\) j j detection by 23% in the process H \(\rightarrow\) W W, for \(M\)(H)=1000 GeV. However, this does not take into account the fine granularity of the electromagnetic part (0.025 \(\times\) 0.025) which will reduce the difference in performance.

#### 2.3.4 Further Comments on '2m' Solution

Given the lower cost of the '2m' solution (see section 4) and the acceptable basic performance, the panel requested more detail on the effect of dead material (e.g. cryostat walls) and cracks.

The effect of the outer cryostat walls is included in the simulated jet energy resolution given above, taking into account the full \(\eta\) range of the barrel. A large amount of work on e/jet discrimination has been done within ATLAS [3]. The high statistics study described (500,000 jets) shows that the required rejection factor can be achieved even without using hadronic leakage cuts in the hadron calorimeter.

A comparison of the effect of cracks in the '2m' and '3m' solutions has been made using Monte Carlo [4], based on a very preliminary conceptual design of the crack region. Jets were generated at \(\eta\) = 0.4, 1.2 and 1.5 with transverse energies of 40, 75, 100 and 300 GeV using the FLUKA code. The data for \(\eta\) = 1.2 are sensitive to the crack between the barrel and the extended barrel where the signals and cryogenic tubes are brought out. No appreciable differences in the energy resolutions could be detected, probably because typically 75% of the energy of a 150 GeV jet has already been absorbed in the electromagnetic section. However, while the cryostat walls were carefully simulated, the cables have not yet been included.

The low energy tails on the measured jet energy are important as they are a source of background to processes involving missing transverse energy. In all cases, the fraction of simulated jets with measured energies outside 3\(\sigma\) was below 2%. Two physics processes have been considered to assess the requirements:

* multijet + \(E_{Tmiss}\) final states for squark and gluino decays [5];
* Z Z \(\rightarrow\) l l + \(E_{Tmiss}\) final states for heavy Higgs decay [6].

Case b) is more critical because of its much lower cross section so only this example will be discussed. The basic signal is H \(\rightarrow\) Z Z \(\rightarrow\) l l \(\nu\nu\). There is an irreducible background fromcontinuum Z Z \(\rightarrow\) | \(\nu\nu\) production and a reducible one from Z + jets where the energies of one or more jets are mismeasured. The top curve in Figure 7 shows the Z + jet background if all the jet energy were to be lost, while the dashed curve shows the contribution for jets with \(1.1<|\eta|<1.3\). The dash-dot curve shows the 'irreducible' background for a calorimeter coverage of \(|\eta|<4\) which would already be dominated by genuine missing \(E_{T}\) from neutrinos produced in b-jet fragmentation The shaded band shows the contribution to the missing \(E_{T}\) that would result if 1-5% of all jets with \(1.1<|\eta|<1.3\) lost more than 30% of their energy in the crack. This band is well below the irreducible Z Z \(\rightarrow\) | \(\nu\nu\) background and, according to the Monte Carlo jet resolution studies, is a very safe upper bound. Nevertheless, it would be desirable to repeat this investigation using the full ATLAS detector simulation, especially in view of some confusing results for single pions which show better than expected energy resolution [4]. Similarly, a combined electromagnetic and tile calorimeter beam test would allow direct measurements of some of the properties.

#### 2.3.5 Conclusion

The conclusion from the above studies is that there is no significant difference in intrinsic performance between any of the barrel solutions, all of which meet the ATLAS physics requirements.

### Calibration and Monitoring

One of the arguments favouring the '3m' solution over the '2m' is that it relies on a common liquid argon calibration and reduces the need for an accurate calibration of the tile calorimeter. The electronics for the liquid argon hadronic calorimeter are identical to those for the electromagnetic, except for a longer shaping time. The goal for the electromagnetic is an accuracy and stability of 0.3%. For the hadronic, 1% should be relatively easy to achieve.

There is experience from other scintillating tile calorimeters such as UA2 and ZEUS [7] which have met the requirements needed here. There are two issues: cell-to-cell intercalibration, and the overall energy scale.

Short term photo-detector gain variations will be monitored using a laser driven light pulse system which will illuminate every cell through an optical fibre. This will also allow a linearity check and can be operated during empty bunch crossings. Such a system is already operational at the test beam. The electronics gains can be separately monitored and calibrated in the proposed front-end scheme (FERMI [8]).

The light output can differ from cell to cell for a number of reasons. It is expected to vary little with time but needs to be monitored continuously from the construction onwards. The tile intercalibration scheme is based on the use of radioactive sources which access every scintillator. A \(\gamma\) source (Cs137, \(E(\gamma)=0.66\) MeV, in the prototype) can be moved through holes which traverse each \(\phi\) module parallel to the beam axis. The DC current produced is read out in parallel to the particle induced pulses. Each individual tile can be monitored and the response of each cell set to a common value. Variations with time can also be detected. The method automatically gives sector-to-sector module intercalibration. The reproducibility of this measurement at the level of 1.5 % has already been achieved with the prototype modules using a 5 mCi source.

Monte Carlo experiments assuming various levels of miscalibration show that, for the bare calorimeter, a 7% miscalibration contributes an additional 2% to the constant term in the resolution. In a jet environment, with the electromagnetic calorimeter in front, a 20% cell-to-cell miscalibration would give the same result.

Absolute energy calibration will be done in the test beam behind electromagnetic modules over the entire \(\eta\) range with appropriate dead materials inserted to represent the ATLAS configuration. The calibration will be transported to other modules using the radioactive source. The effect of magnetic field on the scintillator light output will need systematic study and this is envisaged by RD34. The tile calorimeter has been shown to have good signal to noise for muons, in test beam measurements, which will provide a further check on calibration.

No problem is anticipated in shielding photomultiplier tubes from the fringe fields of the 8 superconducting toroid coils.

### Scintillator Aging and Radiation Damage

The presence of a significant amount of monomer, and surface crazing can reduce the light output of scintillator, 1% monomer causing a 10% decrease in light attenuation length over 10 years. The monomer concentration in granulated polystyrene PSM-115 is less than 0.1%. Furthermore, inspection of injection moulded scintillator tiles produced over ten years does not indicate any deterioration of surface quality, a result confirmed in several calorimeters [9].

The radiation damage for the '2m' case from 10\({}^{6}\) pb\({}^{-1}\) (10 years running at a peak luminosity of 1.6 \(\times\) 10\({}^{34}\) cm\({}^{-2}\) s\({}^{-1}\)) is expected to reduce the light output from the first tile at \(\eta\) = 0 by about 4.8% and at \(\eta\) = 1.5 by 6.2% [10]. This estimate is based on results from the SDC [11]. After recalibration, the energy resolution for 300 GeV jets is increased by 0.16% and the jet signal reduced by 0.14% at \(\eta\) = 1.5.

### Discussion

The full liquid argon solution has the obvious advantages of being a homogeneous device with common electronics and calibration, excellent granularity, little radiation problem, and a minimum of cracks and dead material. Its size makes it difficult to handle, however, and the use of krypton would be very expensive.

Given that the hybrid solutions offer adequate performance, the panel considers that a full liquid argon calorimeter can be excluded on cost grounds as it costs 25 MCHF more than the cheapest solution.

The '3m' solution shares most of the good features of the full liquid argon, including the ability to use H1-like feedthroughs; the dead region where the feedthroughs are located is after 7 \(\lambda\). The cryostat is also transportable. However, the cost is 8 MCHF higher than the '2m' solution assuming the granularity for the tiles in the '3m' solution given in Table 2.

The jet resolution of the '2m' solution is well within the ATLAS requirements. Noise is negligible for the hadronic part and there is a fast response. There is redundancy in the readout through having two independent fibres for each tile. The expected level of radiation damage is acceptable and the calibration procedures seem adequate.

For a fixed outer radius, the '2m' solution has about 0.6 more active absorption lengths than the '3m'. As discussed above, the extra dead material (cryostat walls) between the electromagnetic and hadronic calorimeters and the dead regions for the feedthroughs and services do not appear to degrade the performance significantly. These are obviously key points that need to be confirmed. In addition, there is no existing solution for the (cold) signal feedthroughs, in contrast to the '3m' and full liquid argon cases.

Overall, the cost saving of 8 MCHF in adopting the '2m' solution is a strong argument in its favour, given that it comfortably satisfies the ATLAS requirements.

The Electromagnetic End Caps

### The Options

There are two possibilities involving the accordion technique, the so-called 'Spanish Fan' which is phi-symmetric, and the 'Fresnel Lens' which is an adaptation of the barrel design. The Thin Gap Turbine (TGT) is also phi-symmetric. Beam tests of a small prototype TGT module are in progress, and beam tests of the Spanish Fan are planned for later this year. The performance of the Fresnel Lens is expected to be the same as the accordion barrel prototype. Phi-symmetry is considered to be desirable for triggering and reconstruction.

The hadronic section will not be discussed in detail. It would consist of parallel plates perpendicular to the beam and could be read out by either the accordion (EST) or the TGT techniques.

### The Spanish Fan

The Spanish Fan is an accordion calorimeter designed to be a flat disc with full azimuthal symmetry. Each end cap is built of two coaxial wheels (Figures 8 and 9). In each wheel the folding angle of the plates varies by roughly a factor of two between the inner and outer radii. As for the barrel, the calorimeter is hermetic with full pointing geometry and fast signal extraction. Because of the high radiation levels, it is proposed to use the so called '0T' readout which has no electronics inside the cryostat, all the preamplifiers being situated on the rear of the end caps. This method has been fully tested and gives a performance similar to preamps in the cold.

The calorimeter is complemented by a 'preshower' section as for the barrel. This consists of a double disc. The outer part (\(1.4<|\eta|<2.3\)) is read out in a crossed strip geometry with preamps in the cold, close to the strips. Cold pipelines are under study which would sit at the periphery of the wheel where the radiation level is comparable to the barrel part. The inner part (\(2.3<|\eta|<3.0\)) is arranged in pads having '0T' readout.

Azimuthal modulations in the response, related to the plate folding, have a maximum amplitude of \(1.5\%\) and can be corrected using the calorimeter data to give a contribution to the constant term of \(0.2\%\). In addition, the argon gap increases radially and requires the high voltage to be adjusted to give a uniform response. However, this can only be done in steps and gives a contribution without correction to the constant term of \(0.2\%\). A recent simulation [12] shows that one day of running at \(10^{33}\) cm\({}^{-2}\)s\({}^{-1}\) allows the radial uniformity of each end cap to be checked to \(0.3\%\), using electrons from Z decay. There is also a radial crack between the two wheels of 2-3 mm at \(\eta=2.15\). For precision physics, a cut of \(15\) mm on either side should be made.

Some parameters and performance figures are given in Table 3. The latter are based on measurements made with the barrel prototype. Each cell is sampled 5 times: at the peak of the pulse and at two points on either side, both for the calorimeter and the preshower. The dynamic range is 16 bits for the calorimeter (2 gain channels per readout) and 12 bits for the preshower. The 5 samplings make the readout less sensitive to the timing of the strobe, and allow pileup to be controlled.

### The Fresnel Lens

The Fresnel Lens is an alternative fallback option using a set of accordion barrel-like modules with their axes vertical, arranged in such a way as to minimize the sagitta (Figure 10). The construction would be straightforward but the lack of phi-symmetry currently disfavours this option.

### The Thin Gap Turbine

The TGT concept is described in the Letter of Intent [1], section 2.3.4, and in proposals to the DRDC [13], [14].

The proposed TGT end cap consists of 16 mechanically in dependent phi sectors which are preassembled separately and then connected to form the total wheel weighing 45 tons [15].

A sector consists of a steel frame and absorber elements which are held in place only from the rear by a comb structure. The absorber elements are oriented at an angle of 45 degrees with respect to the direction of the incident particles (Figures 11 and 12). Each element constitutes an independent mechanical and electrical entity, containing a readout board with the preamplifiers close to the readout pads. The absorber elements can be assembled and tested separately prior to installation. Summing and merging boards with analogue pipelines are located at the back plane of the calorimeter inside the liquid argon and the readout uses analogue multiplexing with 12-bit equivalent dynamic range near the outer edge of the cryostat which reduces the number of feedthroughs required.

At small radii, the absorber elements become rather small. Therefore, the innermost absorber elements are assembled and installed as one unit in the wheel, the so called 'central plug'.

Unlike the Spanish Fan, the TGT has no separate preshower detector but makes use of strips, for \(|\eta|<2.5\), within the calorimeter. With the proposed 5-fold longitudinal segmentation (i.e. (1,1,8,8,2) \(\times\) 1.26 \(X_{0}\) ) the first segment would act as a preshower and the second would contain the strips, the equivalent width in \(\theta\) being 2.5 mm extending over 0.1 in \(\phi\), and 0.003 in \(\phi\) extending over 15 mm in theta.

Basic parameters and performance details are given in Table 3, together with those for the Spanish Fan. Further information on the expected performance, which is supported by first beam tests, can be found in various notes [16-19]. The quoted \(\gamma/\pi^{0}\) separation makes use of a neural network technique which has not been applied to the Spanish Fan. The two thickest depth samplings have two gain channels per readout with 5 digitizations of the pulse as for the Spanish Fan. The remaining three depth samplings have one gain channel and one digitization.

### Discussion

The obvious points favouring the Spanish Fan solution are that it has the same basic technology as the barrel electromagnetic calorimeter, which is well proven in large scale prototypes, and has no electronics in the cold in a region of high radiation, except for the outer part of the position detector where the dose is lower. The fact that all the analogue signals are brought our of the cryostat would allow the same readout scheme to be used as for the barrel calorimeters, whether based on FERMI [8] or on analogue pipelines.

A strong point of the TGT technique is its flexible modular structure which allows the lateral and depth granularity to be easily varied in the design, and furthermore permits the manufacture of the absorber elements to be distributed among several institutions. There is a

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|l l|c|c|} \hline  & & **Spanish Fan** & **TGT** \\ \hline Coverage & - calorimeter & \(1.4<\left|\eta\right|<\,2.9\) & \(1.4<\left|\eta\right|<\,2.9\) \\  & - mesh/strips & \(1.4<\left|\eta\right|<\,2.3\) & \(1.4<\left|\eta\right|<\,2.5\) \\ \hline Granularity & & \(.025\times.025\) & \(.025\times.025\) \\ (\(\Delta\eta\times\Delta\phi\)) & & \((.03\times.05,\,\left|\eta\right|>\,2.15)\) & \((.05\times.05,\,\left|\eta\right|>\,2.3)\) \\ \hline \hline Samplings in depth & & \(3\) & \(5\) \\  & & (3rd \(2\times\) coarser in \(\eta\)) & \\ \hline Position resolution & & \(2\) mm/\(\sqrt{E}\) & \(1\) mm/\(\sqrt{E}\) \\ \hline \(\gamma\) angular resolution & & \(25\) mrad/\(\sqrt{E}\) & \(35\) mrad/\(\sqrt{E}\) \\ \hline \(\gamma/\pi^{0}\) separation & & \(4.7\) & \(12\) (neural net) \\  & & (50 GeV \(E_{T}\)) & (50 GeV \(E\)) \\ \hline \(e/\pi\) separation & (50 GeV) & \(790\pm 31\,0\) & \(450\) \\ \hline Readout channels & - calorimeter & \(25600\) & \(49408\) \\ (one end cap) & - mesh/strips & \(404\,96\) & \(43264\) \\ \hline Overall thickness & & \(27\)\(X_{0}\) & \(27\)\(X_{0}\) \\ \hline Uniformity & & \(\pm 1.5\%\) & \(<1\%\) \\  & & (correctable) & \\ \hline Energy resolution & - stochastic term & \(9.8\%\) & \(9.5\%\) \\  & - constant term & \(0.5\%\) & \(<1.0\%\) \\  & - electronic noise & \(290\) MeV & \(1\,80\) MeV \\  & (pileup larger) & & \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 3: Parameters and performance of the Accordion and TGT end capslower operating voltage ( \(<\) 800 V) because of the reduced liquid argon gap and the proposed use of multiplexing allows a considerable saving on feedthroughs. On the other hand, multiplexing is incompatible with the FERMI scheme.

Table 3 shows that the basic performances of the Spanish Fan and TGT are not very different, and that both are expected to meet the stated ATLAS requirement of 1% for the constant term. In both cases, pileup will be more important than the electronic noise at high luminosity. The main points that favour the TGT are the better intrinsic uniformity of response and the larger number of depth segments in the calorimeter. However, the non-uniformity can be monitored and corrected for the Spanish Fan, and when the preshower detector is included, the benefit of the greater depth segmentation is not so clear. The advantage of the last electromagnetic compartment is discussed in reference 18.

The principal concern of the panel is that the TGT relies fundamentally on electronics inside the liquid argon, namely the preamplifiers which are embedded in the absorber elements and the summing and shaping amplifiers on the back plane. The peak neutron fluxes and radiation doses are listed in the Letter of Intent as 8.2 \(\times\) 10\({}^{13}\) neutrons/cm\({}^{2}\)/year and 21 kGy/year respectively; the neutron flux is an order of magnitude higher than anywhere in the tracking detectors. Radiation damage may be increased by the fact that the electronics are at low temperature. Clearly, the TGT design could not be adopted without a fully convincing demonstration of the ability of the electronics to give the required performance under the radiation conditions. Although tests have started, it will take about one year to complete the testing of all components, including pipelines and multiplexers.

The lower estimated cost of the TGT option is partly accounted for by the reduced number of feedthroughs. It has been argued that multiplexing, if successfully demonstrated, could equally be applied to the accordion technique with a consequent saving. Other cost differences arise from the assumptions made in the costing which are discussed in the next section.

## 4 Cost and Manpower

### Estimates

The panel reviewed the cost and manpower requirements for the various options. Cost and manpower summaries are given in Tables 4 and 5. In most cases, the cost estimates provided by the proponents of the various technologies have been retained without modification. In a few cases, the estimates have been revised after discussion between the neutral and expert members of the panel. No contingencies are included in either the cost or the manpower estimates.

The estimated cost for the full liquid argon option with accordion end plugs was 133 MCHF on the same basis. As mentioned earlier, this option has already been rejected on cost grounds and will not be discussed further.

The cost of the cryogenics and cryostats was estimated by Saclay who have experience with similar systems and includes the manpower. For the intermediate or '3m' solution, the barrel feedthrough cost is based on the known cost of H1 feedthroughs. In the full hybrid or '2m' case, the cost of the barrel feedthroughs has been increased from 3.5 MCHF to 5.9 MCHF to allow for their expected greater cost. The costs of the mechanics of the accordion calorimeters are based on experience with prototype construction in RD3. Similarly, the costs of the TGT mechanics have been estimated by the RD33 collaboration, based on the design of the prototype which is presently being tested. For the hadronic end plugs, they are preliminary estimates, and no manpower estimate has been made in this case.

Table 5: Manpower Summary (MY) (1Y = 1600 HRS)The cost per channel of the accordion electronics is taken to be the same for all channels throughout the calorimeter whether electromagnetic or hadronic and is based on the '0T' readout, but other readout options are expected to have similar cost. The cost of the preamplifiers is 7 CHF per channel based on 8-channel circuits and the cost of the readout chain from the shapers to the input to the DAQ is 60 CHF per readout cell, similar to an estimate of 55 CHF per channel used for the tile calorimeter.

For the TGT, the preamplifier cost is taken as 4 CHF per channel, assuming 16-channel circuits. This estimate, which has to be compared with 7 CHF for the accordion, was made assuming an 80% yield of devices, following experience with the first production of 8-channel chips. The cost of the readout chain from the input to the analogue pipeline to the input to the DAQ is estimated at 30 CHF per readout cell to be compared with 60 CHF for the accordion. This is partly explained by the lower number of pulse samplings and gain channels mentioned in section 3. The use of multiplexing in the cold greatly reduces the number of feedthroughs and is reflected in the lower cryostat and cryogenics cost, less by 2.3 MCF for the '2m' solution.

For the preshower and strip detectors, the cost per channel is estimated at 27 CHF for the accordion and 22 CHF for the TGT.

The tile calorimeter costs and mappower estimates result from an industrial feasibility study for the mechanics, with the scintillator plates being manufactured in the participating institutes by injection moulding. Industrial quotations are used for photomultipliers, bases and mu-metal shields. The tile readout cost, including shaping, level-1 pipeline and associated systems is based on FERMI.

### Discussion

The cost difference of 8.2 MCHF between the '2m' and '3m' solutions using the accordion end plugs is considered quite reliable as it depends on similar assumptions - i.e. the two solutions are different mixes of the same technologies. The most uncertain item is the cost of the compact barrel feedthroughs in the '2m' solution for which no design exists yet.

A large part of the cost difference of 2.95 MCHF between the accordion and TGT options in the '2m' solution is accounted for by the saving on feedthroughs of 2.73 MCHF. The larger heat dissipation from the TGT electronics in the liquid argon increases the cryogenics cost and offsets this to some extent. A further contribution to the cost difference between the accordion and the TGT comes from the technologically more advanced and less conservative design of the TGT electronics, leading to the lower estimated price per channel.

## 5 Conclusions

* All of the proposed techniques for either the electromagnetic or hadron calorimetry appear to be capable of meeting the ATLAS physics requirements. There are some minor differences in performance, but the panel considers these insufficient to outweigh the cost and technical arguments that are used later.
* The use of scintillator tiles for the end cap hadronic calorimeters is excluded for reasons of radiation.
* A full liquid argon calorimeter, though clearly the most homogeneous would cost about 25 MCHF more than the recommended solution and has been excluded on cost grounds with the agreement of the whole panel, including the experts and the two spokesmen.

* Two main options were considered for the barrel, the so-called '2m' and '3m' solutions, in which the entire hadronic calorimetry is in tiles, or the first 3 \(\lambda\)s in liquid argon, respectively. These are also referred to as the 'full hybrid' and 'intermediate' solutions. As these options are different mixes of the same technologies, the reduced cost and manpower requirements of about 8 MCHF and 33 man-years respectively, for the '2m' solution, are considered significant. The principal arguments favouring the '3m' solution are that the cell-to-cell calibration requirements for the scintillator calorimeter are less precise by a factor 3-5, the radiation risks are reduced, and there is less dead material between the electromagnetic and hadronic compartments. The panel was satisfied by evidence from beam tests and experience elsewhere that the necessary level of calibration could be achieved for the full scintillator-tile HCAL, and that the deterioration of the calorimeter with radiation would be acceptable. The effects of dead material and cracks on jet energy resolution, missing energy resolution and electron identification were studied and also found to be within the ATLAS requirements. In recommending the '2m' solution, the panel took into account the greater difficulty of designing the signal feedthroughs in the cryostat.
* The most economical configuration for the end caps is an extended scintillator barrel with liquid argon end plugs (Figure 1) as this minimizes the size of the cryostats.
* For the end cap electromagnetic calorimeters, the panel considered that phi-symmetry was desirable but did not feel that the greater depth segmentation of the TGT offered significant advantages over the Spanish fan. The TGT technique is flexible and mechanically elegant as well as uniform in response. A preliminary mechanical design [15] indicated that it could be built with a minimum of dead material. As it incorporates the equivalent of the 'preshower' in the calorimeter, and uses multiplexing inside the cryostat which reduces the number of feedthroughs, the cost is estimated to be a few MCHF lower than that of the Spanish Fan. However, the cost difference estimate is less reliable than that for the barrel because different technologies are being compared and it is therefore more dependent on the assumptions made in the costing. Against the TGT is that it relies fundamentally on electronics inside the liquid argon. These electronics (preamplifiers, summing amplifiers, and analogue pipelines) would be exposed to high radiation levels. By contrast, the proposed readout for the Spanish Fan calorimeter has no electronics in the cold, though space for them has to be found close to the feedthroughs outside the cryostat. (The preshower has some cold electronics but is less critical.) Two approaches to making a recommendation were considered by the panel:- a) a specific choice made now for the Spanish Fan, OR b) a delayed choice to allow more time to accumulate evidence on the ability of the TGT electronics to function with long term reliability in the radiation environment. The panel was conscious of the importance of maximizing the availability of intellectual and financial resources within the collaboration, but a majority of members felt that it was in the best interests of ATLAS to make a definite recommendation in favour of the Spanish fan now, in view of the fact that the TGT offers only marginally better physics performance, and even after a further year might still be open to the same question of reliability. The advantage to the collaboration would be the ability to plan its activities around a single option well in advance of the technical proposal. The minority supporting a delay (two members) believed that a decision was premature as the time needed for the additional R&D was short compared to the detector construction timescale, and that ATLAS would potentially benefit if the TGT proved acceptable. The division of the panel on this point highlights the need for the collaboration to have a better mechanism for taking overall resources into account, as this is beyond the scope of a single panel (see also item 8). The panel therefore recommends the Spanish fan on technical grounds, because the long term reliability can be better guaranteed. Nevertheless, the panel encourages continued R&D on the TGT, including the multiplexed readout, as the promising electronics developments may be applicable more generally to the ATLAS calorimetry.
* The main criticism of the Spanish Fan is that it has an inherent non-uniformity of response at the level of 1-2 per cent. However, the non-uniformities are regular and can in principle be corrected in order to give an acceptable constant term. A prototype version is expected to be available for beam tests later this year. A satisfactory outcome of these tests is an essential milestone.
* A detailed design is required for the liquid argon end plug hadronic calorimeters. An opportunity exists here for people not currently participating in the ATLAS calorimetry. More generally, ways of involving a wider community in the whole of the calorimetry should be pursued.

## 6 Other Points

* A possible further cost saving of several MC HF could be made by replacing the function of the preshower detectors by strip detectors in the first layer of the calorimeter as in the GEM detector. The readout pads would be replaced by strips covering one sixth of the \(\eta\) interval and six times the \(\phi\) interval, leaving the number of channels unchanged. This has not yet been sufficiently studied to make a recommendation.
* The panel also considered the use of Liquid Krypton in the barrel. The most economical approach would be to replace the absorber plates by thinner ones, optimised for krypton, within the same cryostat. Initial running with liquid argon would reduce the calorimeter plus preshower thickness to 23 \(X_{0}\), but this would probably be acceptable in the early stages with low luminosity. The additional costs for krypton liquid at western prices would be 9 MC HF, and the cryogenics and purification a further few MCHF. The case for using krypton, however, needs further study.

## 7 Recommendations

The following recommendations are made by the independent members of the panel:

* The ATLAS calorimeter should have an extended hadronic barrel calorimeter with liquid argon end plugs.
* The hadronic barrel calorimeter should be based on scintillating tiles only, including the extended barrel, subject to confirmation of the required performance in beam tests and Monte Carlo simulations.

3. The baseline option for the electromagnetic end plugs should be the 'Spanish Fan' version of the accordion calorimeter, subject to the satisfactory demonstration of a prototype and the achievement of a constant term in the energy resolution of 0.5%.

## 8 Final Remark

The panel wishes to stress that these recommendations are made without consideration of the overall balance of resources within ATLAS as this will depend also on recommendations made by other panels. This suggests the need for another body within the collaboration that can coordinate the overall requirements and contributions.
