Introduction

The uncertainty on the jet energy scale (JES) drives the precision of physics measurements involving jets. Combining measurements from different experiments reduces the the total experimental uncertainty. However, such combination is only possible when the level of correlation among the different experimental uncertainties is known. Dedicated studies have been performed by both ATLAS and CMS, in order to derive a transverse momentum (\(p_{\mathrm{T}}\)) and pseudorapidity (\(\eta\))\(-\)dependent JES calibration and its uncertainties. The baseline jet definition and calibration procedures used by the two experiments are rather different: the jets used in most ATLAS physics analyses are built based on energy deposits in the calorimeter [1], while a particle-flow algorithm is widely used by CMS [2].

Both experiments use _in situ_ methods where jets balance well-calibrated objects to correct the baseline JES calibration and derive its uncertainties [1, 3]. The JES uncertainties at ATLAS and CMS cover uncertainties related to the transition from reconstructed jets to jets at the particle level. In the case of ATLAS, particle level jets are built using standard jet clustering algorithms on stable particles with a lifetime longer than 10 ps from the Monte Carlo (MC) generators, excluding muons and neutrinos. To be best adapted to reconstructed particle-flow jets, the particle level definition at CMS includes muons. While neutrinos and muons are a negligible contribution for the samples used in _in situ_ methods and for deriving the inclusive MC-based JES, they are a significant fraction of the parton energy for jets containing semileptonic decays of heavy quarks.

The level of correlation among the uncertainties of the JES calibrations for the two experiments can be evaluated under a reasonable set of assumptions. The correlations provided have been used as input for the combination of the top-quark mass using 4.9 fb\({}^{-1}\) of 7 TeV LHC data [4].

## 2 Summary of the ATLAS JES Uncertainties

A detailed description of the ATLAS JES calibration, uncertainties and correlations is provided in Refs. [1, 5]. After the pileup correction and the MC-based JES calibration step, the jet \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) scale in data is corrected using _in situ_ techniques that exploit the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) balance between the jet \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) and the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) of a reference object. The _in situ_ methods used to calibrate the jet energy scale proceed as follows:

* Firstly, the average \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) for jets within \(0.8\leq|\eta|<4.5\) is equalized between data and Monte Carlo to the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) of jets within \(|\eta|<0.8\), exploiting the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) balance between a central and a forward jet in events with only two jets at high \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) (dijet \(\eta\)-intercalibration).
* After the pseudorapidity dependence of the jet response is removed by the previous step, the _in situ_ JES correction for jets within \(|\eta|<1.2\) is derived using the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) of a photon or a \(\mathbf{Z}\) boson (decaying to \(e^{+}e^{-}\) or \(\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\)) as reference. The \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) of the reference object can be used to balance the jet directly (Direct Balance, or DB) or through a projection of the missing transverse momentum on its axis (\(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\) projection fraction, MPF). The JES correction is obtained from a combination of both methods: DB for \(\mathbf{Z}\)-jet and MPF for \(\gamma\)-jet.
* Finally, events where a system of low-\(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) jets recoils against a high-\(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) jet are used to calibrate jets in the \(\mathrm{TeV}\) regime. The low-\(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) jets are within \(|\eta|<2.8\) while the leading jet is required to be within \(|\eta|<1.2\).

Table 1 presents a summary of the uncertainties affecting the various _in situ_ methods. Each uncertainty component is assigned to one of four categories, based on its source and correlations:

Table 1: Summary of the uncertainty components for each _in situ_ technique (**Z**-jet, \(\gamma\)-jet, multijet \(p_{\text{T}}\) balance and \(\eta-\)intercalibration) used to derive the jet energy scale uncertainty for ATLAS. Each uncertainty component is also categorized depending on its source as either: detector (labeled det.), physics modeling (labeled model), mixed detector and modeling (labeled mixed), or as statistics and method (labeled stat./meth.).

* _Physics modeling_ (model)
* _Statistics and method_ (stat./meth.)
* _Mixed detector and modeling_ (mixed).

For the combination of measurements from ATLAS and CMS, it is suggested to consider the uncertainty components in the _detector description_ and _statistics and method_ categories as uncorrelated. The uncertainties in the _physics modeling_ and _mixed detector and modeling_ categories are likely to contain components that are correlated between the two experiments.

For some applications (e.g. parameterized likelihood fits) it is preferable to have the JES uncertainties and correlations described by a reduced set of uncertainty components. It is for this reason that ATLAS has developed a method to reduce the number of uncertainty components while maintaining a sufficient accuracy for the JES uncertainty correlations [1]. First a covariance matrix is built from the independent uncertainty components (nuisance parameters) affecting the _in situ_ methods, and an eigenvector decomposition of this matrix is performed. The eigenvectors provide a new representation of the JES uncertainty in terms of independent components. An accurate approximation of the covariance matrix can be obtained by separating out only a small subset of eigenvectors that have the largest corresponding eigenvalues. From the quadratic sum of the remaining components, a residual, left-over uncertainty is determined. This approximation conserves the total uncertainty, while the precision on the description of the correlations can be directly determined by comparing the original full correlation matrix and the approximate one. This alternative representation allows to strongly reduce the number of uncertainty components, with only a small (i.e. percent level) loss in precision for the description of the correlations [1].

This method was applied to the full set of \(\mathbf{Z}\)-jet, \(\gamma\)-jet and multijet balance uncertainties in Table 1, irrespective of the uncertainty source, and the corresponding uncertainty components are available for ATLAS physics analyses. However, it is also useful to keep track of the physical meaning of the uncertainty components, e.g. for a proper combination of measurements from different experiments. For this reason, the same reduction technique was applied independently to each set of uncertainty components within each individual category listed in Table 1. This category reduction approach will generally result in a larger number of nuisance parameters than the global reduction. This alternative set of JES uncertainty components (or the full one in Table 1) is recommended for ATLAS physics analyses aiming at combinations with data from other experiments.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|p{113.8pt}|p{113.8pt}|} \hline Name & Description & Category \\ \hline High-\(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) & jets outside the reach of _in situ_ techniques (single particle) & det. \\ \hline Flavor composition and response & modeling of light-quark/gluon differences & model \\ \hline Response of jets containing \(b-\)hadrons (\(b-\)jets) & modeling of \(b-\)quark jets & model \\ \hline Closure of the calibration & JES calibration closure in fast simulation samples & special \\ \hline Pileup & \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) dependence of the correction, validation of MC-based offset correction from _in situ_ studies & special \\ \hline Close-by & response and modeling for close-by jet topologies & mixed \\ \hline \end{tabular}

Table 2: Summary of the uncertainty components in addition to those belonging to _in situ_ techniques in ATLAS. Each uncertainty component is also categorized depending on its source as either: detector (labeled det.), physics modeling (labeled model), mixed detector and modeling (labeled mixed), as statistics and method (labeled stat./meth.). Uncertainties not belonging to either category are labeled as special.

In addition to the uncertainties from the _in situ_ methods, other JES uncertainty components are considered in ATLAS and outlined below (see also Table 2 for a summary). For the purposes of determining the correlations among different experiments, each component is assigned to one of the categories above.

* Uncertainty for high-\(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) jets outside the reach of the _in situ_ techniques, estimated using the full propagation of single particle uncertainties to jets. This uncertainty is categorized as related to the _Detector description_
* Uncertainty related to the flavor composition and flavor response of jets for topologies different from those used to derive the calibration. Those uncertainties are estimated by comparing different Monte Carlo samples in terms of response difference between light quark and gluons and parton composition. Both uncertainties belong to the _Physics modeling_ category.
* Uncertainty on the energy scale of \(b-\)jets, estimated using Monte Carlo samples with systematic variations in terms of fragmentation and \(b-\)hadron decays, and validated using data. This uncertainty is applied as an alternative to the flavor composition and response in the case of \(b-\)jets, and it is treated as a _Physics modeling_ uncertainty.
* Uncertainties due to different simulation conditions in Monte Carlo samples where fast simulation is employed. This uncertainty is derived by comparing the closure of the calibration between the nominal Monte Carlo sample and the fast simulation sample. It does not belong to any of the categories above.
* Uncertainties due to additional proton-proton interactions, both from the same bunch crossings and from preceding/successive ones. This uncertainty is estimated comparing specific pileup calibration properties in data and simulation, and does not belong to any of the categories above as it pertains to the pileup calibration rather than to the effect of pileup on _in situ_ techniques.
* Uncertainty due to close-by jets, estimated by comparing the ratio of jets built out of tracks and calorimeter jets as a function of the distance between the two jets in data and Monte Carlo. This is a _Physics modeling_ uncertainty.

## 3 Summary of the CMS JES Uncertainties

At CMS, the jet energy calibration strategy is based on a factorized approach of successively correcting for pileup offset, non-linearity in \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\), and non-uniformity in \(\eta\) to relate - on average - the energy of the reconstructed jet to the true particle level jet.

Residual data/MC-differences are corrected according to the results of \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\)-balance and MPF-studies in dijet, \(\mathbf{Z}\)-jet, and \(\gamma\)-jet event topologies. A detailed account of the CMS jet energy calibration strategy at \(\sqrt{s}=\)7 TeV is given in Ref. [3]; performance plots for the final 2011 calibration are available in Ref. [6].

The individual steps to correct the jet energies proceed as follows:

* The pileup offset corrections are necessary to estimate and subtract the energy not associated with the high-\(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) scattering. The CMS approach is based on the jet area method, in which the per-event average \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\)-density \(\rho\) and the jet area A are used to subtract the offset energy. The \(\eta\)-dependence of the offset is taken into account from direct offset measurements in zero bias events using the random cone method.
* The MC-based jet response calibration is determined in simulated QCD events and corrects the energy of the reconstructed jets as a function of \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) and \(\eta\).

* Dijet events are used to relate the average response of jets at arbitrary \(|\eta|<5.2\) relative to the average response in the central (barrel) detector region within \(|\eta|<1.3\). Data/MC scale factors are determined from \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\)-balance and MPF (central method) response estimators as a function of \(\eta\). An extrapolation to zero additional event activity is performed to reduce the effect of radiation modeling uncertainties.
* \(\mathbf{Z}\)-jet, and \(\gamma\)-jet events are used to determine the absolute scale in the barrel region \(|\eta|<1.3\). In both topologies, response estimators based on \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\)-balance and MPF (central method) are evaluated and an extrapolation to zero additional event activity is performed.

Starting with the 2011 dataset, the systematic uncertainties associated with the calibration are provided in the form of mutually uncorrelated signed components. Each uncertainty component corresponds to a \(1\sigma\) systematic shift fully correlated in \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) and \(\eta\). For systematic uncertainties that are uncorrelated between different subdetector regions, separate uncertainty components are provided, each applicable in a limited \(\eta\) range. The quadratic sum of all individual components adds up to the total JES uncertainty.

The JES uncertainties are listed in Table 3 and classified in four broad categories: pileup offset, relative calibration of the jet energy scale versus \(\eta\), and absolute energy scale versus \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\). In addition, an uncertainty regarding the flavor response modeling and an uncertainty to cover variations in the detector conditions over time are considered.

There are five uncertainty components considered for the pileup offset, most relevant at low \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\). The PileUpDataMC component encodes observed data/MC differences in the offset measurement using the random cone method. PileUpPt covers the observed offset dependence on jet \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) in the random cone method and is provided separately for the individual detector regions (PileUpPtBB for \(|\eta|<1.3\), PileUpPtEC for \(1.3\leq|\eta|<3.0\), PileUpPtHF for \(3.0\leq|\eta|<5.2\)). PileUpBias covers the difference between the MC truth offset and the offset measured in MC using the random cone method. PileUpOOT estimates the residual uncertainty related to out-of-time pileup for the analysis of samples with varying pileup conditions (e.g. collected by prescaled triggers) by assigning 25% of the average OOT offset energy as uncertainty. PileUpJetRate covers for observed jet rate variations as a function of the number of reconstructed primary vertices in 2011 single jet triggers after applying pileup corrections.

For the relative jet calibration using dijet events, the uncertainty on the jet energy resolution in data is propagated to the measurement and taken into account as uncertainty. It is provided separately for the sub-detector regions: RelativeJEREC1 for \(1.3\leq|\eta|<2.5\) (endcap region covered by the tracker), RelativeJEREC2 for \(2.5\leq|\eta|<3.0\), and RelativeJERHF for \(3.0\leq|\eta|<5.2\). Due to high trigger thresholds and prescales, statistical uncertainties in the determination of the scale in data have to be considered in the forward detector region (separately in detector regions: RelativeStatEC2 for \(2.5\leq|\eta|<3.0\) and RelativeStatHF for \(3.0\leq|\eta|<5.2\)). The uncertainty related to the correction for final-state radiation (RelativeFSR) takes into account differences in the resulting residual corrections when either using Pythia or Herwig++ as reference MC.

The absolute scale uncertainties cover for the extrapolation to high and low \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) outside of the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\)-range directly accessible using \(\mathbf{Z}\)-jet and \(\gamma\)-jet events and the uncertainties related to these direct measurements. Statistical uncertainties of the measurements are propagated as AbsoluteStatistical, uncertainties on the ECAL and the tracking scale as AbsoluteScale, and the difference in flavor mixture between the nominal QCD mixture and \(\mathbf{Z}\)-jet/\(\gamma\)-jet composition is covered by AbsoluteFlavorMapping. AbsoluteMPFBias encompasses the MPF-method related uncertainties discussed in Ref. [3]. These are uncertainties due to the sensitivity of the MPF response to out-of-cone (OOC) and underlying event (UE) effects, but also uncertainties related to the extrapolation to zero additional event activity (ISR+FSR), proton fragments, and QCD background. These uncertainties are evaluated at the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) with the highest statistical sensitivity in \(\mathbf{Z}\)-jet and \(\gamma\)-jet events. For the extrapolation to higher and lower \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\), SinglePion and HighPtExtra account for a variation of the single particle response within uncertainties indicated by direct measurements

and response differences due to different fragmentation and underlying event modeling in Pythia and Herwig++.

Differences in the detector response of light, charm, and bottom quark as well as gluon-initiated jets relative to the inclusive response in the QCD mixture used for the determination of the MC truth corrections are considered as Flavor uncertainty component. They are quantified by comparing the flavor response differences between Pythia and Herwig++, taking the largest observed difference as an uncertainty. Observed time-dependent variations of the detector response not fully compensated by the prompt reconstruction in the endcap regions are considered as a Time uncertainty.

For combinations with other experiments it is recommended to evaluate all the uncertainty components listed in Table 3 individually. Some of the components are provided separately for subdetector regions and have to be varied independently (exact technical labels of all individual components are given in Table 4).

For analyses like the top-quark mass measurements with a simultaneous fit of a jet energy scale factor (JSF), which are sensitive to the differences in the response between light quark and gluon originated jets to jets containing a \(b-\)hadron, it is recommended to follow a dedicated procedure: In addition to the nominal JES uncertainties described above being propagated to all jets, the response of \(b-\)jets is varied separately from all other jets and in addition by the full flavor-dependent JES uncertainty (Flavor) as defined above. Cross-checks varying the \(b-\)fragmentation and semileptonic \(b-\)hadron decays as well as comparing Pythia and Herwig directly in \(t\overline{t}\) events yield uncertainties of comparable size. The refined procedure adopted for 8 TeV measurements avoids doublecounting. It is outlined in Section 5 and described in detail in Ref. [7].

## 4 Correlations between ATLAS and CMS JES uncertainty components

The knowledge of the correlations between the JES uncertainty components of the ATLAS and CMS detectors is crucial for the combination of precision measurements. A dedicated discussion between the two experiments, with the aim of comparing the techniques used to derive both jet calibration and uncertainty components, has been undertaken. This has led to an estimate of the level of correlation between similar uncertainty components across the two experiments.

Different categories of correlations between the two experiments have been identified:

1. uncertainties that are uncorrelated between the two experiments, such as **the statistical and detector-based components** (due to statistically independent data and MC events and to different detector technologies respectively);
2. **modeling uncertainties in the _in situ_ techniques** that are shared by both experiments (e.g. \(\gamma\)-jet and \(\mathbf{Z}\)-jet direct balance and MPF methods). Some uncertainty components in this category (e.g. the out-of-cone) have a direct one-to-one correspondence between ATLAS and CMS and are likely to be correlated. However, other components (i.e. ISR+FSR (CMS) and radiation suppression due to 2nd jet cut (ATLAS), proton fragments (CMS) and MC generator differences (ATLAS), as well as the extrapolation in \(\Delta\phi\) between the jet and the \(\mathbf{Z}\) (ATLAS) and the photon purity) introduce important de-correlations between the uncertainties of the two experiments in this category. The fact that the ATLAS uncertainties are obtained through a \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\)-dependent combination between the \(\gamma\)-jet and \(\mathbf{Z}\)-jet results, while the CMS calibration extracts a \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\)-independent scale factor from the direct measurements and takes the uncertainty on the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\)-dependence into account from MC extrapolations, further enhances the level of de-correlation. The de-correlation is confirmed by the different amplitudes of the various uncertainty components for the two experiments.
3. **uncertainties related to the model-dependence of the relative calibration corrections:** both experiments observe differences in the relative calibration due to radiation modeling when comparing to either Pythia or Herwig++ as reference MC and assign systematic uncertainties. This is reflected in the uncertainty related to the difference at the nominal working point with partially suppressed additional event activity for ATLAS and in the uncertainty related to the extrapolation to zero additional event activity for CMS. As the same MC generators are used by both experiments for evaluating those uncertainties, one expects a strong correlation between them. However, some de-correlation is also expected due to the different analysis procedures used in ATLAS and CMS.
4. **uncertainties from the dependence of the jet response on its partonic flavor:** the generators employed for the estimation of this uncertainty in the two experiments are the same, therefore correlations between those uncertainties are expected to be as high as 100%.
5. **uncertainties related to the \(b-\)jet energy scale:** CMS provides an overall flavor uncertainty derived from the comparison of Pythia and Herwig++. The treatment of \(b-\)JES uncertainties for analyses with _in situ_ JSF fits is explained in Section 3. ATLAS includes a comparison of Pythia and Herwig++ in its estimate of the \(b-\)JES uncertainty (replacing the nominal flavor composition and response uncertainty for \(b-\)jets). As a consequence, the uncertainties are treated as partially correlated across the two experiments.
6. **pileup uncertainties:** ATLAS employs a MC-based offset calibration that is cross-checked in data. It corrects for both in-time and out-of-time pileup, and its uncertainty is estimated using track jets and \(\gamma\)-jet events. The CMS approach is based on the event-by-event jet area method, modified by taking into account the \(\eta\)-dependence from direct offset measurements using the random cone method. The techniques for the pileup correction and the MC generator tunes for simulating minimum bias (pileup) events employed by the two experiments are different. For this reason the uncertainties are treated as uncorrelated.
7. **high-\(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) uncertainties:** the derivation of this uncertainty is different for the two experiments in terms of methodology and test-beam \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) ranges employed. This uncertainty is treated as uncorrelated across the two experiments.
8. **close-by jet uncertainties:** this uncertainty is derived from a data to Monte Carlo comparison in event topologies with jets close to each other. Since this is considered an uncertainty component for ATLAS and a cross-check for CMS, and given that the other uncertainties are generally derived using isolated jets, it is treated as uncorrelated across the two experiments.
9. **other uncertainties:** uncertainty components that are only present for one of the two experiments, such as time-dependent effects for CMS, multijet balance and calibration components for ATLAS, are treated as uncorrelated.

Since the methodologies and assumptions to derive correction and uncertainties are not always directly comparable, a range of correlation between the two experiments has been assigned to each category (except for the uncorrelated uncertainties) to be used to combine measurements, rather than a single correlation coefficient.

1. uncorrelated uncertainties (including statistical, high-\(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) and pileup components): correlations between ATLAS and CMS are 0%
2. _in situ_ modeling uncertainties: correlations between ATLAS and CMS ranging from 0% to 50%
3. relative calibration uncertainties: correlations between ATLAS and CMS ranging from 50% to 100%4. flavor uncertainties: correlations between ATLAS and CMS ranging from 0% to 100%
5. \(b-\)JES uncertainties: correlations between ATLAS and CMS ranging from 50% to 100%

Table 4 lists, for each of the uncertainty categories and respective components, the range of correlation coefficients to be used when combining measurements between the ATLAS and CMS experiments, and the mapping between ATLAS and CMS components wherever possible.

A scan of the level of correlations within the ranges proposed should be performed, and the most conservative result should be quoted. Testing the extremes of the range can be sufficient if the observable and its uncertainty have a monotonous dependence on the level of correlation.

## 5 Conclusion and outlook

As a result of the detailed comparison of the procedures to determine the jet energy calibration and its uncertainties in ATLAS and CMS at 7 TeV, a good understanding of the JES correlations between both experiments has been achieved. The correlation groups proposed in Section 4 provide the current best estimate of these correlations and are useful for combinations of precision measurements.

For future iterations of the determination of ATLAS and CMS JES correlations, several possible improvements for a coherent systematics treatment in both experiments have been identified:

1. relative calibration modeling uncertainties: in order to reduce the impact of the different radiation modeling in Pythia and Herwig++ it has proven useful to extrapolate to zero additional event activity in dijet events. After such an extrapolation differences between Pythia and Herwig++ in the resulting corrections are largely reduced.
2. the approach to the derivation of the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\)-extrapolation uncertainties should be homogenized between the two experiments. In particular, there should be well-motivated uncertainties for the single particle propagation of jets with \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) beyond the reach of _in situ_ techniques, using calorimeter knowledge and test-beam data.
3. the procedure of how to estimate flavor uncertainties should be homogenized in order to narrow the range of correlation down.
4. the set of Monte Carlo samples used to derive specific \(b-\)JES uncertainties should be agreed between the two experiments upon consultation of the theoretical and Monte Carlo generator communities.
5. a \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\)-dependent combination of the _in situ_ results should be performed for both experiments in order to maximally exploit the direct measurements of the response.

In the meantime, CMS has refined the procedure to determine flavor uncertainties at 8 TeV, providing separate uncertainties for each partonic flavor as well as for analysis-specific flavor mixtures [8]. Residual \(b-\)jet specific uncertainties are covered in individual analyses by varying the \(b\)-quark fragmentation function and the branching ratios of semileptonic \(b-\)hadron decays. In addition, the _in situ_ results are used to explicitly correct for any observed \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\)-dependence.

For the 2012 data, ATLAS has adopted the jet area method for subtracting the extra energy due to pileup. The ATLAS pileup uncertainty is now described by four independent components. As several _in situ_ studies have shown that the effect of close-by jets on the JES are well described in simulation, the close-by jet uncertainty has been dropped.

With such improvements in the procedures to determine JES uncertainties, future discussions of the JES correlations are expected to be able to narrow down the ranges of correlation. A continued discussion, before the final recommendations for analyses are in place, will be useful to further scrutinize the techniques used by both experiments and foster improvements.
