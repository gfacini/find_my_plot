Investigation of systematic uncertainties on the measurement of the top-quark mass using lepton transverse momenta

The ATLAS Collaboration

###### Abstract

This study investigates the impact of systematic uncertainties on a top-quark mass (\(m_{\mathrm{top}}\)) measurement in the lepton+jets channel with the ATLAS experiment at the LHC. For the study, simulated \(t\bar{t}\) events with lepton+jets final states at a centre of mass energy of \(8\,\mathrm{TeV}\) are used. In contrast to other analyses, this study is designed to exploit the dependence of the lepton kinematics on the top-quark mass, by parameterising the lepton's transverse momentum distribution with MC simulations. Due to its different systematic uncertainty, this method can potentially contribute to a more accurate measurement of \(m_{\mathrm{top}}\). The overall uncertainty in this study is \(2.3\,\mathrm{GeV}\), dominated by the current uncertainty on initial and final state radiation. Since the result depends on the modelling of the top-quark transverse momentum, it is sensitive to higher order QCD corrections. The influence of such corrections is estimated by reweighting the next-to-leading-order MC prediction by next-to-next-to-leading-order calculations. This leads to a shift in the measured top-quark mass of \(-1.0\pm 0.5\,\mathrm{GeV}\) and therefore shows that higher order QCD corrections can influence the determination of \(m_{\mathrm{top}}\) based on lepton \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) distributions.

## 1 Introduction

One top-quark property of particular interest is its mass \(m_{\rm top}\). As the top-quark mass is a free parameter of the Standard Model, the precise determination of \(m_{\rm top}\) is crucial for consistency checks [1]. At the LHC, ATLAS and CMS have presented precise measurements of \(m_{\rm top}\) in different decay topologies [2; 3; 4; 5; 6; 7]. In addition to the separate measurements by each experiment, a combination of measurements of all four experiments, ATLAS, CDF, CMS and D0 has been performed, resulting in a top-quark mass of \(m_{\rm top}\) = 173.34 \(\pm\) 0.27 (stat) \(\pm\) 0.71 (syst) [8].

Complementary to Ref. [2; 3; 4; 5; 9], the study presented here adopts an approach originally used in Ref. [10] to determine the top-quark mass. Instead of studying an observable which is directly related to the invariant mass of the reconstructed top-quark, the mass is inferred from the lepton transverse momentum (\(p_{\rm T}\)) distribution. Due to energy and momentum conservation, the mass of the top-quark translates into high momenta of its decay products. Therefore, in case of the lepton+jets channel, the information of the top-quark mass is reflected in the lepton transverse momentum distribution. This complementary approach, with its different sensitivity to systematic uncertainties may help to further increase the precision on the top-quark mass in future combinations. This can already be seen from Ref. [11], where the \(t\bar{t}\) di-lepton channel is used to measure the top-quark mass from the lepton transverse momenta showing, for example, a smaller sensitivity to the jet energy calibration due to fewer jets being involved in the selection of \(t\bar{t}\) events.

This study uses simulated proton--proton collisions at a centre-of mass energy of 8 \(\mathrm{TeV}\) with \(t\bar{t}\) lepton+jets final states, in order to investigate the impact of systematic uncertainties on a \(m_{\rm top}\) measurement from the lepton \(p_{\rm T}\) distribution with a template technique. In the lepton+jets channel, one of the two \(W\) bosons originating from the \(t\bar{t}\) system decays into a lepton and neutrino, while the other \(W\) boson decays hadronically. This study is based on a full-fledged measurement of \(m_{\rm top}\) which uses the lepton \(p_{\rm T}\) spectrum as the kinematic observable for a template fit. The note details the chosen approach to allow for improving systematic uncertainties for a future measurement.

## 2 Signal and background samples

This study is based on simulated proton-proton collisions for a centre-of-mass energy of 8 \(\mathrm{TeV}\) normalised to an integrated luminosity of 20.2 \(\mathrm{fb}^{-1}\). Different MC simulations are employed to model signal and background processes, to create templates and to evaluate systematic uncertainties. Single-top-quark as well as \(t\bar{t}\) processes are simulated using Powheg-Box[12; 13; 14] with the CT10 [15] parton distribution function (PDF) and a top-quark mass parameter of 172.5 \(\mathrm{GeV}\). For hadronisation and showering the generated events are processed by Pythia6[16] with the P2011C [17] parameter tune using the CTEQ6L1 [18] PDF set. To construct templates, MC datasets with varied top-quark mass parameter, ranging from 165 to 180 \(\mathrm{GeV}\) in steps of 2.5 \(\mathrm{GeV}\), are utilised.1 The largest background contributions for this analysis originate from \(W^{\pm}\) and \(Z\) bosons processes in association with jets. They are simulated with Alpgen[20], using the CTEQ6L1 PDF set. The showering and hadronisation is done with Pythia6 adjusted to the P2011C tune. Herwig[21] with CTEQ6L1 is used to generate diboson (\(ZZ\), \(WW\) and \(WZ\)) processes, where the AUET2 [22] parameter set is applied. Additional datasets specifically used to evaluate the impact of systematic uncertainties are described in Section 6. To account for additional proton-proton interactions(pile-up), simulated pile-up events are added to the generated events. Those events are reweighted to match the pile-up profile measured in data. After the MC generation step, all events are passed through a full simulation of the ATLAS detector [23] based on GEANT4 [24], and they are then processed with the same reconstruction procedure as data. Since the full detector simulation is very computing intensive, some of the datasets used for the evaluation of systematic uncertainties and the single-top-quark mass variation samples are processed with a simplified shower parametrisation model for the calorimeter [25]. The impact of QCD multi-jet production needs to be estimated directly from data. Multi-jet events can be falsely selected if they contain either a lepton originating from a heavy flavour hadron decay (non-prompt) or if a jet is wrongly identified as a lepton (fake). To estimate the contribution of the multi-jet background a data-driven matrix method is used.

## 3 Event selection

In the \(t\bar{t}\) lepton+jets channel, the final state is characterised by one charged lepton (electron or muon)2, one neutrino and four jets originating from bottom- and light-quarks. Depending on the charged lepton's flavour, the events are split in two categories, the electron and the muon channel. To specifically select \(t\bar{t}\) lepton+jets events, selection criteria as in [26] are applied3. The essential criteria are:

Footnote 2: Electrons and muons resulting from the leptonic decay of tau leptons are also included.

Footnote 3: A tighter cut on the lepton \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) is chosen in this investigation due to the perceivable difference within systematic uncertainties between the measured and predicted event yield below 30 GeV as observed in [26]

* exactly one reconstructed electron or muon with \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\geq 30\) GeV and \(|\eta|<2.5\);
* at least four reconstructed jets with \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\geq 30\) GeV and \(|\eta|<2.5\), of which at least two have to be \(b\)-tagged (at a 70% efficiency working point);
* a missing transverse energy larger than 30 (20) GeV in the electron (muon) channel;
* a transverse \(W\) boson mass4\(m_{\mathrm{T}}^{W}\) of at least 30 GeV in the electron and \(m_{\mathrm{T}}^{W}+E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\geq 60\) GeV in the muon channel.

Footnote 4: Due to the missing z-component of the neutrino momentum, the invariant mass of the \(W\) boson cannot be calculated, instead the transverse mass, defined as \(m_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{W}}=\sqrt{E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\ p_{\mathrm{T}}^{e /\mu}\left(1-\cos\left(\Delta\phi\left(e/\mu,\ E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}} \right)\right)\right)}\) is used, in which \(\Delta\phi\) is calculated as the difference between the azimuthal angle of the neutrino and the charged lepton.

In order to reduce the systematic uncertainties, additional cuts on kinematic variables, like the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) of the 5\({}^{\mathrm{th}}\) leading jet5 (\(<40\) GeV) and the angular distance between two jets (\(\Delta R_{\mathrm{jj}}<1.1\)) are introduced (cf. Section 6.5). The final event selection in this study contains mainly \(t\bar{t}\) events and some single-top events with a total fraction of 93% and 4%, respectively, while, with a total of 2%, W/Z-Jets events are the main source of background. Since the non-top-quark backgrounds are small in comparison only the \(t\bar{t}\) and single-top processes are considered in the following analysis. Figure 1 shows the impact of the top-quark mass on the lepton \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) distributions after the event selection.

## 4 Template fit

This section describes the template method which is used to extract a top-quark mass from the simulated electron and muon \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) distributions. First, the method itself is motivated, while second the parametrisation of the lepton \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) is introduced. The derivation of the templates from the different mass-value MC signal samples are described and the procedure of extracting \(m_{\mathrm{top}}\) from data is detailed. Finally, the closure tests, which are performed to verify the validity of the method, are presented.

A template is designed to extract an underlying parameter from a given observable. MC simulation samples are created for different values of this parameter and the dependence of the resulting observable is parametrised as a function of it. This parametrisation, the template, is then fit to a given distribution to determine the parameter value which best describes the distribution. In this analysis the lepton \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) distributions are used to extract the top-quark mass. Therefore, the lepton \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) distributions are parametrised with a modified Novosibirsk function [27]. The Novosibirsk function is basically an asymmetric Gaussian distribution, suitable to describe Gaussian shaped peaks with a large tail to one side. Its functional form is given by:

\[f(x)=N\cdot\exp\left(-\frac{1}{2}\cdot\left(\frac{\ln\left(\,1+\left(x-\mu \right)\frac{\sinh\left(\tau\sqrt{\ln 4}\right)}{\sigma\sqrt{\ln 4}}\,\right)}{ \tau}\right)^{2}+\,\tau^{2}\right), \tag{1}\]

where \(N\) denotes the overall normalisation, \(\mu\) and \(\sigma\) represent the mean and the width parameters, and \(\tau\) controls the asymmetry of the function. To ensure good agreement between the simulated distributions and the Novosibirsk parametrisation, only events with lepton transverse momenta in the range \(30\,\mathrm{GeV}\leq p_{\mathrm{T}}\leq 150\,\mathrm{GeV}\) are taken into account in the fit. The fits of the Novosibirsk function to the electron and muon \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) distributions for a simulated top-quark mass parameter of \(172.5\,\mathrm{GeV}\) are shown in Figure 2(a) and Figure 2(b), respectively. The templates are derived by fitting the Novosibirsk function to the lepton \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) distribution for each mass-value used to simulate a MC sample. The result of these fits is shown in Fig. 3. Since the parameters show a linear dependence on \(m_{\mathrm{top}}\), each parameter is fit with a first order

Figure 1: Lepton transverse momentum distributions of the signal MC for different \(m_{\mathrm{top}}\) values. The electron transverse momentum is shown in (a) and the corresponding muon distribution is presented in (b). The lower panels show the ratio of the lepton \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) distribution to the reference distribution for \(m_{\mathrm{top}}\) =\(172.5\,\mathrm{GeV}\).

polynomial function. The normalisation parameters, however, are fixed to 0.15 in the electron and to 0.12 in the muon channel to focus the template's sensitivity on the \(m_{\mathrm{top}}\)-dependent shape of the lepton \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) distribution and to evade the perceivable difference in the event yields between data and simulation observed within the evaluated systematic uncertainties in [26]. The asymmetry parameter in the electron channel only marginally depends on \(m_{\mathrm{top}}\). However, since the parameter shows some sensitivity in the muon channel, for consistency reasons between the two channels, the asymmetries are not fixed.

The results of these fits are used as initial values for a combined fit. The combined fit is designed to fit the linear dependence of the Novosibirsk parameters on the top-quark mass. Therefore, all lepton \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) distributions of the different mass-value samples are taken into account in a single fit, in order to extract the slope and y-intercept for each parameter. The result of this fit is shown in Fig. 2(c), Fig. 2(d) and in Fig. 3. Since in the combined fit all Novosibirsk parameters are solely dependent on \(m_{\mathrm{top}}\), the top-quark mass entirely controls the shape of the Novosibirsk function. By fitting the template to the simulated

Figure 2: Parametrisation of the lepton \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) distributions for a top-quark mass parameter of \(172.5\,\mathrm{Ge\kern-1.0ptV}\). In the study the \(t\bar{t}\) (shown in white) as well as the single-top process (marked in blue) are considered signal and therefore both are used for the template derivation. Figures (a) and (b) show the parametrisation with the Novosibirsk function to the electron and muon \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) signal distributions. Figures (c) and (d) show the combined parametrisation, derived from fitting all seven mass samples simultaneously, which assumes a linear parameter variation with \(m_{\mathrm{top}}\). The corresponding \(\chi^{2}/\mathrm{ndf}\) values of the fits are given in the legends, both approaches yield similar results. All plots are normalised to unity. In the fit, only events shown in the plots are taken into account, therefore excluding any under- or overflow events. The lower panels in each subfigure show the ratio of the fitted parametrisation to the lepton \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) distribution.

lepton \(p_{\rm T}\) distributions, the value of \(m_{\rm top}\) can be determined. The actual value of the top-quark mass from a given distribution can be extracted with a binned likelihood fit. For the number of events in a given bin, a Poisson distribution is assumed. It is given by:

\[\mathcal{L}\left(\mathrm{lep}_{\rm pt}\,|\,m_{\rm top},\,N_{\rm el},\,N_{\rm mu }\right)=\prod_{\rm j}^{\rm bins}\left(\frac{\lambda_{\rm j}^{N_{\rm obs,j}}}{N _{\rm obs,j}!}\right)\cdot\exp(-\lambda_{\rm j}), \tag{2}\]

where \(N_{\rm obs,j}\) denotes the number of observed and \(\lambda_{\rm j}\) the number of expected events, in bin j. Since \(\lambda_{\rm j}\) is predicted by the template, the only free parameters are the top-quark mass \(m_{\rm top}\), as well as the overall normalisation factors in the electron and muon channel, \(N_{\rm el}\) and \(N_{\rm mu}\)6. The result of applying the binned likelihood fit to the lepton \(p_{\rm T}\) distribution of the signal MC sample is shown in Fig. 4.

Footnote 6: The normalisation factors are weakly sensitive to \(m_{\rm top}\) and therefore carry little information on the top-quark mass.

## 5 Pseudo experiments

To assess systematic uncertainties and to check for any biases of the method, pseudo experiments are performed. A pseudo experiment is constructed by randomly drawing as many events from a given MC sample as are expected for data. To account for statistical fluctuations in the measurement, the number of events drawn equals the number of events expected in data varied within the Poisson uncertainty. The resulting lepton \(p_{\rm T}\) distributions are fit with the template, which returns a pseudo experiment's top-quark mass. This procedure is repeated 5000 times. For each pseudo experiment are extracted, the top-quark mass \(m_{\rm top}\), the corresponding statistical uncertainty \(\delta m_{\rm top}\). From these a pull value is calculated, defined as

\[\mathrm{pull}=\frac{m_{\rm top}-m_{\rm top}^{\rm MC}}{\delta m_{\rm top}}, \tag{3}\]

where \(m_{\rm top}^{\rm MC}\) denotes the MC top-quark mass parameter. Each of these three distributions is Gaussian-shaped and fit accordingly, resulting in a fitted mean value for each distribution. This procedure is repeated for each MC mass-value, with the results shown in Fig. 5. The pull distribution is used to check if there occur any systematical shifts in the course of the procedure and to investigate the goodness of the estimation of the statistical uncertainty. If the procedure is unbiased and if the statistical uncertainties are estimated correctly, the fitted mean of the pull distribution is consistent with zero and its width equals unity. Since the number of events drawn for all pseudo experiments exceeds the number of available MC events by far, an oversampling correction is applied [28]. The fit of a constant function to the mean of the pull distribution, which is shown in Fig. 5(b), reveals a consistent shift towards larger masses. The actual shift for \(m_{\rm top}\) amounts to \(0.50\pm 0.40\,\mathrm{GeV}\) (cf. Fig. 5(a)). The fitted width of the pull distribution (cf. Fig 5(c)) is compatible with unity.

Figure 3: The four parameters of the Novosibirsk function as a function of the top-quark mass. The parameters are obtained by fitting a Novosibirsk function to the lepton \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) distributions of each mass-value MC with the top-quark mass parameter ranging from 165 to \(180\,\mathrm{GeV}\). Fig. (a) shows the parameter dependencies in the electron and Fig. (b) in the muon channel. In both channels the overall normalisation parameter is fixed. The first order polynomial fits to the parameter distributions are shown in green, while the combined fit, which is done by taking into account the electron and muon channels simultaneously, is shown in orange. The \(x^{2}\)/ndf values are obtained from these fits and take into account the statistical uncertainties on the parameters at each mass point.

The template fit in the electron channel is presented in Fig. (a) and the fit for the muon channel is shown in Fig. (b). The fit result with the corresponding statistical error and the \(\chi^{2}/\mathrm{ndf}\) value are given in the legend.

The plots are obtained by fitting the results of 5000 pseudo experiments for each mass-value with a Gaussian function. Fig. (a) shows the fitted mean top-quark mass distribution subtracted by the underlying MC top-quark mass parameter, while Fig. (b) presents the mean of the pull distributions, respectively. The fitted width of the pull distribution is shown in Fig. (c), where the error is taken as the fitted width of the Gauss function and its uncertainty is the Barlow corrected error of the fit for this parameter. The results of constant fits to each of the distributions presented in the figures are shown in green and the corresponding values are given in the legend. In addition, Fig. (a) is also fit with a linear function for comparison which yields \(\Delta m_{\mathrm{top}}^{\mathrm{fitted}}=([0.53\pm 0.42]+[0.012\pm 0.083] \cdot(m_{\mathrm{top}}^{\mathrm{MC}}-172.5))\) GeV with a fit parameter correlation of 29%.

## 6 Uncertainty estimation

This section details the different sources of uncertainties studied for this analysis, which can be divided in different categories: the uncertainty on the method calibration, the modelling uncertainties, the background estimation uncertainties and the uncertainties related to the detector itself. An overview to the different contributions on the overall precision on the measured top-quark mass is presented in Table 1. The approach to derive the top-quark mass from the lepton \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) spectrum is sensitive to any additional transverse momentum transferred to the leptonically decaying top quark. In particular, initial and final state radiation can modify the transverse momentum of the top quark. Therefore, in the following, emphasis is given to those systematic uncertainties which affect the transverse momentum distribution of the top quark and, thus, increase the uncertainty of the top-quark mass derived from the lepton \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) spectrum.

To evaluate the uncertainty on the measured top-quark mass due to systematic influences, for each uncertainty, a total of 5000 pseudo experiments, as described in Section 5, are performed. The uncertainties are estimated either with the same MC events as used in the nominal analysis, by just varying the systematic value under study by \(\pm 1\sigma\), or by different MC events, produced with changed MC parameter(s). In either case the analysis is repeated on the resulting datasets, and the difference in the measured top-quark mass between the nominal and the varied datasets is quoted as the systematic uncertainty. The overall uncertainty on the measured top-quark mass is given as the quadrature sum of the different uncertainty components. As can be seen from Table 1, the overall uncertainty on \(m_{\mathrm{top}}\) originates mainly from theoretical sources, while the detector uncertainties contribute little to the overall precision. The single largest contribution originates from the ISR/FSR uncertainty, while the other individual components contribute less than 10 % each to the overall uncertainty7.

Footnote 7: This is the relative contribution to the total uncertainty, when adding the uncertainties in quadrature.

### Method calibration

By conducting 5000 pseudo experiments, the uncertainty on the method used to extract the top-quark mass from the lepton \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) spectrum is evaluated. As described, pseudo experiments are performed for the different MC top-quark mass parameters, revealing an average shift in \(m_{\mathrm{top}}\) (cf. Fig. 5(a)). The uncertainty on this shift is considered as uncertainty for the method calibration.

### Modelling uncertainties

To estimate the influence of different choices and parameters in the MC simulations, different MC samples are compared to each other or, where applicable, to the nominal dataset.

#### Signal MC generator:

To evaluate the uncertainty due to the choice of different signal MC generators for the \(t\bar{t}\) process the nominal Powheg event generator is compared to MC@NLO [29, 30]. The modelling of the parton shower, hadronisation and underlying event for both generators is done with the Herwig program using the AUET2 tune. A difference in \(m_{\mathrm{top}}\) between the chosen MC generators can arise in particular from the combination with the parton shower that approximates higher order corrections. The full difference between the two generators yields an estimate for this uncertainty.

### Single-top Wt generator:

About 65% of the single-top contribution comes from Wt events. To investigate the systematic uncertainty originating from this process, the difference between the diagram removal (DR) and the diagram subtraction (DS) next-to-leading-order (NLO) calculation schemes [31] is evaluated. Therefore, the nominal \(Wt\) MC sample using the DR scheme is compared with a Powheg+Pythia dataset which uses the DS scheme. The resulting uncertainty is estimated from the full difference between the two approaches.

### Hadronisation and parton shower:

Different models exist to describe the hadronisation process. Since one cannot decide from first principles which model is better suited to describe nature, two models are compared to determine their influence on the resulting top-quark mass. Therefore, the Lund String model [32, 33] as it is implemented in Pythia6 is compared to the cluster fragmentation model [34] used in Herwig. The two programs also differ in other choices, like the parton shower ordering, matching scales and fragmentation functions. These difference can affect the transverse momentum of the top quark used for measuring the lepton \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) spectrum and, hence, constitute an enhanced contribution to the systematic uncertainty. To determine the overall uncertainty due to the hadronisation model, events are generated with the Powheg generator and then passed either to Pythia6 using the P2011C or to Herwig with the AUET2 tune. The full difference between the two approaches is considered for the uncertainty. The difference in the lepton \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) distributions between the two hadronisation models can be seen in Fig. 6.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{l c} \hline \hline Uncertainty & \(\Delta m_{\mathrm{top}}\) [GeV] \\ \hline Statistics & 0.94 \\ \hline Method calibration & 0.40 \\ \hline Signal MC generator & 0.62 \\ Single-top Wt generator & 0.28 \\ Hadronisation and parton shower & 0.55 \\ ISR and FSR & 1.39 \\ Underlying Event & 0.67 \\ Colour Reconnection & 0.23 \\ Parton distribution function & 0.42 \\ \hline Single-top contribution & 0.10 \\ \hline Leptons & 0.50 \\ \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\) & 0.12 \\ \(b\)-tagging & 0.08 \\ Jet energy scale & 0.60 \\ Jet energy resolution & 0.32 \\ Jet vertex fraction & 0.05 \\ \hline Total & 2.27 \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}

### Initial and final state radiation:

In order to estimate the effects of a change in the amount of initial and final state radiation (ISR/FSR) on the measured top-quark mass, different parameters like \(\Lambda_{\text{QCD}}\) and \(h_{\text{damp}}\)[35], are varied in the Powheg+Pythia simulation with the P2012 tune [17], to allow for an increase or decrease in QCD radiation [36, 37, 38]. The resulting uncertainty calculated as half of the difference between the two samples is, with 40 %, the single largest contribution to the uncertainty on the top-quark mass in this study. This is due to the influence of the ISR/FSR radiation on the transverse momentum of the top quark. The additional radiation of particles alters the top \(p_{\text{T}}\) spectrum, therefore the lepton \(p_{\text{T}}\) spectrum is modified, which results in a shift in the measured top-quark mass. To illustrate the effect of ISR/FSR, Fig. 7 compares the shape of the lepton \(p_{\text{T}}\) distribution between the two ISR/FSR systematics samples with enhanced (radHi) and reduced (radLo) amount of radiation.

### Underlying event:

The underlying event (UE) refers to processes contributing to an event except for the hard scattering itself. It is mainly comprised of soft and semi-hard multiple parton interactions and the amount of the contribution can be varied in the MC simulation. To assess the influence of different underlying event models the Perugia parameter tunes [17] P2012 and P2012mpiHi are compared. For this comparison the same partonic events created with Powheg+Pythia are used. The full difference is considered as an estimate of this uncertainty.

### Colour reconnection:

The specific model of the colour reconnection (CR) may influence the final result. Since the strength of the colour flow can be tuned in the MC simulation, the impact on the measured top-quark mass is estimated by comparing a model with reduced colour reconnection strength to the nominal one. Therefore events are

simulated with Powheg+Pythia using either the P2012 or the P2012loCR tune [17]. The full difference between the two approaches is taken as an estimate for the systematic uncertainty on the CR model.

#### Parton distribution function:

To estimate the uncertainty originating in the choice of the parton distribution function (PDF) the recommendations of the PDF4LHC working group are followed [39]. Therefore, the envelope of the CT10, MSTW2008 [40] and NNPDF2.3 [41] parton distribution functions is built at 68% confidence level and the largest up and down variations are taken into account as uncertainties. Since the required information is not available in the nominal \(t\bar{t}\) and single-top MC simulations, different MC datasets are used instead. The overall uncertainty due to the PDF is estimated from half of the difference between the up and down variations.

### Non \(t\bar{t}\) contributions

With an expected fraction of roughly 93% the \(t\bar{t}\) process is by far the largest contributor to the final event yield. Nevertheless, other processes contribute as well and their influence on the determination of the top-quark mass is studied. To estimate the systematic uncertainties, the single-top \(t\)-, \(s\)- and \(Wt\)-production cross sections are varied by currently typical measurement precision of \(\pm\)15 % and the remaining background contributions are varied by \(\pm\)50 % [42, 43, 44]. These variations result in a 4% contribution to the total uncertainty.

### Detector modelling

Measurements by the detector have an intrinsic uncertainty. The uncertainty related to the different objects measured in the detector are described here. These uncertainties are sensitive to the transverse momentum

Figure 7: Comparison of the lepton \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) distributions on the reconstruction level for samples with enhanced (radHi) and reduced (radLo) ISR/FSR. The influence in the electron channel is shown Fig. (a) and the influence in the muon channel is presented in Fig. (b).

of the top quark used for measuring the lepton \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) spectrum since the detection and identification efficiency change with the momentum or energy of the lepton. The nominal value is varied according to its estimated uncertainty by \(\pm 1\sigma\) and the uncertainty on the measured top-quark mass is half of the difference of the up and down variation. If there is no up and down variation for a systematic uncertainty the difference between the nominal and the variation is used. The evaluation of the detector uncertainties is conducted simultaneously for both signal as well as background processes.

#### Lepton systematic uncertainties:

The uncertainties related to electrons and muons comprise the uncertainties on the energy scale, the energy resolution as well as on the trigger and reconstruction efficiency for the two lepton flavours. These components are studied in leptonic \(J/\psi\) and \(Z\) data events [45, 46, 47] and their influence on the top-quark mass in the analysis is estimated. The overall uncertainty receives its main contribution from the electron energy scale.

#### \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\) systematic uncertainties:

Since the missing transverse momentum depends on the other physics objects in an event, its value is recalculated during the estimation of the lepton and jet systematic uncertainties, accordingly. The influence on the derived value of \(m_{\mathrm{top}}\) is therefore included in the numbers quoted there. In addition the uncertainty due to components in the \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\) calculation, which are not related to physics objects is estimated from varying the scale and resolution of the soft term [48], which results in an almost negligible impact on the derived top-quark mass value.

#### \(b\)-tagging systematic uncertainties:

There are small differences between the \(b\)-tagging efficiency measured in data and MC simulations. To correct for this, scale factors depending on the jet flavour, \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) and \(\eta\) values of jets are applied [49]. To estimate the uncertainty on \(m_{\mathrm{top}}\), the \(b\)-tagging, \(c/\tau\)-tagging and mis-tagging scale factors are varied within their uncertainties. The overall uncertainty, given as the quadratic sum of the individual components, is negligible.

#### Jet energy scale:

The jet energy scale (JES) is calibrated with test beam data and MC simulations. In addition, the JES can be improved with in-situ methods by using the balance of physics objects in the transverse plane [50, 51, 52]. The relative uncertainty on the JES is a function of the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) and \(\eta\) of a jet and varies from about 1% to 4%. The uncertainty can be split up into 26 different components, which are studied independently to estimate the influence on the measured top-quark mass. The overall uncertainty is obtained from the sum of squares of the individual JES components. With a contribution of 44 % and 23 %, the flavour composition and flavour response are the largest contributors to this systematic uncertainty.

This study does not attempt to minimise the JES uncertainty in view of the substantially large uncertainty due to ISR & FSR.

#### Jet energy resolution:

The uncertainty due to the jet energy resolution (JER) is obtained by smearing the energies of the jets within their uncertainties and repeating the analysis. The JER is split up into 11 individual components, which are taken into account separately. The result of the systematic JER variations in total amounts to only a minor contribution on the top-quark uncertainty.

#### Jet reconstruction efficiency:

To account for minor jet reconstruction inefficiencies of jets with a transverse momentum below \(30\GeV\), \(2\%\) of such jets are randomly dropped from simulated events, and the resulting uncertainty on \(m_{\mathrm{top}}\) is derived. Since the event selection requires at least four jets with \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>30\GeV\), no effect on the top-quark mass could be observed.

#### Jet vertex fraction systematic uncertainties:

The uncertainty introduced by the requirement on the jet vertex fraction (JVT) is estimated by varying the JVT within its uncertainty. It yields a negligible contribution to the systematic uncertainty of the derived top-quark mass.

### Minimising the overall uncertainty on the top-quark mass

In order to minimise the total uncertainty of a measurement of \(m_{\mathrm{top}}\) from the lepton \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) spectrum, requirements on the minimal \(\Delta R_{\mathrm{jj}}\) between any two jets in an event and on the jet multiplicity are investigated. Such requirements have shown to improve the overall uncertainties in previous studies [53]. The evaluation of the uncertainties is done as described in the previous subsections. The uncertainties obtained for different cuts on \(\Delta R_{\mathrm{jj}}\) with and without the jet multiplicity cut are given in Table 2. The main improvements originate from the reduced modelling and hadronisation uncertainties. The reason is that, with the \(\Delta R_{\mathrm{jj}}\) cuts applied, the Powheg+Herwig dataset tends to agree more with the dataset used for both comparisons. This study shows that for a value of \(\Delta R_{\mathrm{jj}}>1.1\) and no additional requirement on the jet multiplicity, the highest precision on \(m_{\mathrm{top}}\) is achieved. With this selection the uncertainty on \(m_{\mathrm{top}}\) is dominated by theoretical sources, while experimental uncertainties only play a minor role8. In particular, the modelling of additional jets from ISR & FSR affects the lepton \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) spectrum, because of its influence on the transverse momentum of the top-quark.

Footnote 8: The contribution of non-top-quark backgrounds is negligible, compared to other uncertainties. It shows a modest increase of 1% in the ‘no Cut’ scenario to 4% in the \(\Delta R_{\mathrm{jj}}>1.2\) case.

## 7 Modelling of the transverse momentum of the top quark

It is well known that the transverse momentum of the top quark is not well modelled in the MC simulations presently available [26]. The main problem is that, until recently, no next-to-next-to-leading-order (NNLO) QCD predictions for differential distributions for top-quark pair production at the LHC were available. A complete NNLO calculation is published in Ref. [54] but is not yet interfaced to a parton shower in an MCevent generator. Since the top-quark transverse momentum directly influences the lepton \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) which is used to extract \(m_{\mathrm{top}}\) in this analysis, the impact on the measured top-quark mass is studied by estimating the influence of NNLO corrections to the NLO MC predictions. Therefore, the \(t\bar{t}\) and single-top MC datasets are reweighted as a function of the transverse momentum of the (anti-)top-quark which is taken from the MC simulation (after final state radiation). The datasets are reweighted on an event-by-event basis, with the weighting factors derived from Ref. [54] as the ratio of the NNLO to NLO prediction dependent on the (anti-)top-quark transverse momentum. Table 3 gives the numbers used for the reweighting to NNLO predictions and the corresponding up and down variations, obtained from Ref. [54]. Each event is reweighted with an overall weighting factor, calculated as the geometric mean of the weighting factors individually obtained for the top-quark and the anti-top-quark. To actually study the influence of the NNLO reweighting, the following approach is followed. For each mass-value, the \(t\bar{t}\) MC events are reweighted with the (anti-)top-quark dependent weighting factor, and a total of 5000 pseudo experiments are performed with the template derived of the unweighted datasets. An example of the difference of the unweighted and reweighted lepton \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) distributions is shown in Fig. 8.

The overall shift is derived, similar to the bias of the measurement discussed in Section 5, with a constant fit to the resulting top-quark masses, which is shown in Fig. 9(a). The actual shift is calculated as the full difference between the result of the constant fit and the bias observed in the measurement (cf. Fig. 5(a)) and amounts to \(-0.97\,\begin{subarray}{c}+0.51\\ -0.47\end{subarray}\,\mathrm{GeV}\). The uncertainty on this shift is estimated by the quadratic sum of the up/down variation of the (anti-)top-quark dependent weighting factors, taking into account the uncertainty of the NNLO prediction, and the uncertainty on the constant fit itself.

As a consistency check, the opposite approach is adopted. Here, the template is created from the reweighted datasets, and this template is applied to the unweighted MC events. Again, a total of 5000 pseudo experiments is performed, with the result shown in Fig. 9(b), which results in a shift of the estimated the top-quark mass of \(1.05\,\begin{subarray}{c}+0.55\\ -0.50\end{subarray}\,\mathrm{GeV}\). Due to the nature of this cross check, the shift is opposite to the one obtained previously, but the absolute values are in agreement with each other. Therefore, the reweighting of the top \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) to NNLO predictions causes an underestimation of the measured top-quark mass in this analysis by \(1.0\pm 0.5\,\mathrm{GeV}\). Without any additional requirement on \(\Delta R_{\mathrm{jj}}\) (cf. Section 6.5) the shift of the top-quark mass would be \(-1.64\,\begin{subarray}{c}+0.64\\ -0.52\end{subarray}\,\mathrm{GeV}\), as can be seen in Figure 10. Here, the same distributions are presented as in Fig. 5(a), 9 but without the \(\Delta R_{\mathrm{jj}}\) requirements.

The shift obtained by the reweighting to NNLO has a significant uncertainty, therefore it may turn out that

the true correction is smaller than what is estimated here. A more precise estimate of this value can only be determined once full NNLO generators interfaced to parton showers are available.

In Fig. (a) the results of the nominal template, which is used to extract the top-quark mass from data, applied to events reweighted to NNLO predictions are shown. In Fig. (b), the template is derived from the reweighted datasets and applied to the unweighted events. Both distributions are fit with constants, which are shown in green, and by linear functions yielding for Fig. (a) \(\Delta m_{\mathrm{top}}^{\mathrm{fitted}}=([-0.48\pm 0.40]-[0.004\pm 0.078] \cdot(m_{\mathrm{top}}^{\mathrm{MC}}-172.5))\,\mathrm{GeV}\) (29% correlation) and for Fig. (b) \(\Delta m_{\mathrm{top}}^{\mathrm{fitted}}=([1.60\pm 0.43]-[0.037\pm 0.085] \cdot(m_{\mathrm{top}}^{\mathrm{MC}}-172.5))\,\mathrm{GeV}\) (31% correlation). To estimate the overall influence on the final result in the measured top-quark mass due to the reweighting to NNLO predictions, the fit results are to be compared to the number obtained from Fig. 5(a).

## 8 Conclusion

In this note, the systematic uncertainties of a measurement of the top-quark mass using the lepton \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) spectrum in lepton+jets events are investigated in detail, with \(20.2\,\mathrm{fb}^{-1}\) of \(8\,\mathrm{TeV}\) LHC simulated proton-proton collisions. Applying tight selection requirements ensures a very pure selection of mainly \(t\bar{t}\) and single-top events, which are both considered as signal, with minor contributions from \(W\)+jets and fake-lepton events. A template method is considered to derive \(m_{\mathrm{top}}\), which exploits the top-quark mass dependence of the electron and muon transverse momentum distributions. The measurement technique and all its systematic uncertainties are evaluated by pseudo experiments.

A thorough scrutiny of systematic uncertainties shows that roughly 40 % of the overall uncertainty on \(m_{\mathrm{top}}\) originates from the uncertainties due to initial and final state radiation. This is due to the sensitivity

Figure 10: Result of 5000 pseudo experiments for the different MC top-quark mass parameters without any cut on \(\Delta R_{\mathrm{jj}}\). Figure (a) shows the estimated bias of the top-quark mass measurement derived as described in Section 5. In Fig. (b) the results of the nominal template, which is used to extract the top-quark mass from data, applied to events reweighted to NNLO predictions are shown. In Fig. (c), the template is derived from the reweighted datasets and applied to the unweighted events. All distributions are fit by constants, which are shown in green, and by linear functions yielding for Fig. (a) \(\Delta m_{\mathrm{top}}^{\mathrm{fitted}}=([0.28\pm 0.33]+[0.017\pm 0.075] \cdot(m_{\mathrm{top}}^{\mathrm{MC}}-172.5))\,\mathrm{GeV}\) (34% correlation), for Fig. (b) \(\Delta m_{\mathrm{top}}^{\mathrm{fitted}}=([-1.42\pm 0.30]-[0.021\pm 0.060] \cdot(m_{\mathrm{top}}^{\mathrm{MC}}-172.5))\,\mathrm{GeV}\) (34% correlation), and for Fig. (c) \(\Delta m_{\mathrm{top}}^{\mathrm{fitted}}=([2.04\pm 0.34]+[0.055\pm 0.067] \cdot(m_{\mathrm{top}}^{\mathrm{MC}}-172.5))\,\mathrm{GeV}\) (34% correlation). To estimate the overall influence on the final result of the measured top-quark mass due to the reweighting to NNLO predictions, the fit results are to be compared to the number obtained from Fig. (a).

of the lepton \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) spectrum to any additional transverse momentum of the top-quark from such radiation processes. Several further sources of systematic uncertainties are very likely correlated with the amount of transverse momentum due to this radiation. By applying a cut on the angular distance between any pair of jets, \(\Delta R_{\mathrm{jj}}\), the overall uncertainty can be reduced by over 40%, to 2.3 \(\mathrm{GeV}\).

Due to the sensitivity of the lepton \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) distributions on the top-quark transverse momentum, the influence of higher order corrections on this result is investigated, which indicates that the determined top-quark mass may be underestimated by \(1.0\pm 0.5\,\mathrm{GeV}\). The NNLO correction is not highly significant compared to the current overall measurement uncertainty. But it may become increasingly important if the other uncertainties are reduced in the future, and will then need to be evaluated more rigorously than with the reweighting technique employed here.
