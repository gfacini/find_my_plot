## 1 Introduction

Production of top quark pairs in association with bosons (\(t\bar{t}H\), \(t\bar{t}W\), \(t\bar{t}Z\)) is important both as signal and background in ATLAS analyses. \(t\bar{t}H\) production provides a unique opportunity to make a direct measurement of the top quark Yukawa coupling. \(t\bar{t}W\) production is interesting as a rare Standard Model (SM) source of same-sign dileptons. \(t\bar{t}Z\) production constrains the coupling of the top quark to the \(Z\) boson and allows to test the SM assumption that the top quark is the weak isospin partner of the bottom quark. It is also a significant background to many beyond the SM (BSM) searches, especially searches for supersymmetry (SUSY).

Searches for \(t\bar{t}H\) production have been performed at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at \(\sqrt{s}=8\) TeV by ATLAS [1, 2, 3] and at \(\sqrt{s}=7\) and 8 TeV by CMS [4, 5]. No statistically significant signal has been observed.

Measurement of \(t\bar{t}V\) production has been performed at the LHC at \(\sqrt{s}=8\) TeV by ATLAS [6] and CMS [7]. ATLAS measured \(t\bar{t}W\) and \(t\bar{t}Z\) cross sections of \(\sigma(t\bar{t}W)=369^{+100}_{-91}\) fb and \(\sigma(t\bar{t}Z)=176^{+58}_{-52}\) fb with significances of 5.0 and 4.2 standard deviations from the background-only hypothesis, respectively. CMS measured the same cross sections with a result of \(\sigma(t\bar{t}W)=382^{+117}_{-102}\) fb and \(\sigma(t\bar{t}Z)=242^{+65}_{-55}\) fb with significances of 4.8 and 6.4 standard deviations from the background-only hypothesis, respectively. The measured cross sections are consistent with the next-to-leading order (NLO) QCD theoretical calculations.

The relatively low cross sections of these processes make it impossible with the currently available data to perform high precision measurements or define control regions with sufficient constraining power. Therefore, analyses where these process are significant backgrounds are particularly reliant on their Monte Carlo (MC) modelling and sensitive to the corresponding systematic uncertainties.

This note is organised as follows. Section 2 outlines the MC generator setups used for modelling of the \(t\bar{t}H\) production, including a detailed discussion of the different MC modelling systematic uncertainties. Section 3 outlines the MC generator setups in preparation for modelling of \(t\bar{t}V\) production. For all MC samples, the top quark mass is set to 172.5 GeV.

Basic kinematic distributions and event properties have been studied at parton or particle level. Unless stated otherwise, the top quark pair and the vector or the Higgs boson produced in the hard process are defined at parton level using the MC record selecting the final replicas after radiation. Particle level jets from quarks originating from the decay of the top quarks or the \(H/W/Z\) boson are reconstructed using the anti-\(k_{\perp}\) algorithm [8], implemented in the FastJet [9] package, with a radius parameter of R = 0.4. \(b\)-jets are defined to be those jets which contain a \(B\)-hadron with \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>\)5 GeV and light jets are all other jets. The missing transverse momentum, \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\) (with magnitude \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\)), is calculated as the vector sum of the momenta of all non-interacting particles (e.g. neutrinos).

## 2 \(t\bar{t}H\)

In the search for Higgs boson production in association with a pair of top quarks, an accurate modelling of this process is essential to distinguish the signal from the overwhelming SM background from top quark pair production in association with jets or \(W/Z\) bosons. In this section, the \(t\bar{t}H\) production cross section calculations and corresponding theoretical uncertainties are summarised and the MC samples generated in ATLAS at \(\sqrt{s}=13\) TeV for Run 2 analyses are described. In addition, a detailed discussion of the different MC modelling sytematic uncertainties is included.

### Cross section calculations and uncertainties

Cross section calculations at leading order (LO) and NLO in QCD for proton-proton collisions at \(\sqrt{s}=13\) TeV were recently published by the MadGraph5_aMC@NLO collaboration [10] (in the following MG5_aMC). These values (including systematic uncertainties) are summarised in Table 1. For the cross section calculations listed in the first row, the five-flavour scheme and the MSTWNLO2008[11] parton distribution function (PDF) set were used. The quoted PDF uncertainty corresponds to the 68% CL error set. The central choice for the renormalisation and factorisation scales, \(\mu_{R}\) and \(\mu_{F}\), is \(\mu_{0}=\mu_{R}=\mu_{F}=H_{\rm T}/2\), where \(H_{\rm T}\) is defined as the scalar sum of the transverse masses \(\sqrt{p_{\rm T}^{2}+m^{2}}\) of all final state particles. The scale variations used for the quoted systematic uncertainties are obtained varying each scale independently up and down by a factor of two. The CERN Yellow Report [12] provides an alternative NLO QCD calculation which gives a higher cross section value, but in agreement within the quoted uncertainties. NLO electroweak corrections are also available [13, 14]. Since this contribution is rather small (\(\sim\)1% in absolute value) for \(t\bar{t}H\) production, it is not taken into account in the cross section value used in ATLAS. However, this correction is expected to have a negligible impact.

### Generated samples

At present, two sets of \(t\bar{t}H\) samples are available in ATLAS for \(\sqrt{s}=13\) TeV studies. The samples use inclusive NLO matrix elements (ME) interfaced to showering and hadronisation event generators, and the Higgs mass is set to 125 GeV. The generator employed for the hard-process is MG5_aMC and events are interfaced to either Pythia8[15] or Herwig++[16]. The MG5_aMC package is based on the MadFKS framework [17] that uses the FKS substraction method [18]. The virtual corrections are handled by the

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{l|c|c} \hline \hline \multicolumn{3}{c}{\(t\bar{t}H\) cross section at \(\sqrt{s}=\)13 TeV [pb]} \\ \hline Theoretical calculation & LO QCD & NLO QCD \\ \hline MG5\_aMC [10] & \(0.3579\pm 0.0003^{+30.0\%+1.7\%}_{-21.5\%-2.0\%}\) & \(0.4608\pm 0.0016^{+5.7\%+2.0\%}_{-9.0\%-2.3\%}\) \\ CERN Yellow Report 3 [12] & - & \(0.5085^{+5.7\%+8.8\%}_{-9.3\%-8.8\%}\)(PDF incl. \(\alpha_{S}\)) \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 1: The LO and NLO total cross sections for \(t\bar{t}H\) production at \(\sqrt{s}=13\) TeV calculated by the MG5_aMC collaboration [10] are shown in the first row. The uncertainties quoted are due to the QCD scale (left) and PDF (right) variations. The second row shows the cross section calculated in the CERN Yellow Report [12] at NLO QCD with zero-width-approximation, which is the one used in ATLAS for \(t\bar{t}H\) normalisation. Electroweak corrections are not included, but they are expected to have a negligible impact (\(\sim\)1%) [13, 14].

MadLoop code [19]. To match the results with parton shower (PS) programs, the MC@NLO method is used. Spin correlation effects for both the decay and the production of generated particles are included using MadSpin [20]. The top quark is decayed using MadSpin, while the Higgs boson is decayed during the parton shower, allowing for all possible decay modes. The central values for the renormalisation and factorisation scales are both set equal to \(\mu_{0}=\mu_{R}=\mu_{F}=H_{\mathrm{T}}/2\). MG5_aMC allows for the evaluation of theoretical uncertainties due to the scale and PDF choice using a reweighting method, without the need to re-run with different settings.

For the MG5_aMC+Pythia8 sample, the PDF set used for the simulation of the hard-process is NNPDF3.0NLO[21] and events are showered with Pythia8 (v8.210 1) configured with the A14 tune [22] using the NNPDF2.3LO[23]. For the calculation of NLO+PS subtraction terms, the _global_ recoil scheme is used for the first final state emission, as recommended by MG5_aMC authors, with the settings summarized in Table 2. In this scheme, the recoil of an emission is shared among all final state particles. Thus, the radiation pattern is unrelated to colour correlations. This is especially convenient for some matching algorithms, such as MC@NLO used in MG5_aMC, where a full analytic knowledge of the shower radiation pattern is needed to avoid double-counting. This approach will miss out on the colour coherence phenomena. Specifically, the phase space for subsequent emissions is larger than for the normal dipole algorithm ( _local_ recoil). Therefore the application of the global recoil option is only for the first emission of the shower.

Footnote 1: This version of Pythia8 allows the propagation of event weights to estimate scale and PDF variations.

For the MG5_aMC+Herwig++ sample, the CT1@NLO PDF set [24] is used for the ME while CTEQ6L1[25] set and the UE-EE-5[26] tune is used for the showering, hadronisation and underlying event.

A summary of the settings and parameters used in the generation of these two samples is presented in Table 3.

Various uncertainties on the modelling of the \(t\bar{t}H\) process coming from different settings or generators for the hard-process or the simulation of showering and hadronisation must be considered.

#### MC generators for the matrix elements calculation

This uncertainty is evaluated by comparing MG5_aMC+Pythia8 and Powheg+Pythia8 samples.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|} \hline Pythia8 settings & Value \\ \hline \hline SpaceShower:pTmaxMatch & 1 \\ \hline SpaceShower:pTmaxFudge & 1 \\ \hline SpaceShower:MEcorrections & off \\ \hline TimeShower:pTmaxMatch & 1 \\ \hline TimeShower:pTmaxFudge & 1 \\ \hline TimeShower:MEcorrections & off \\ \hline TimeShower:globalRecoil & on \\ \hline TimeShower:limitPTmaxGlobal & on \\ \hline TimeShower:nMaxGlobalRecoil & 1 \\ \hline TimeShower:globalRecoilMode & 2 \\ \hline TimeShower:nMaxGlobalBranch & 1 \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 2: Pythia8 settings required for the interface of MG5_aMC with Pythia8.

**QCD scale variations: renormalisation and factorisation scale choice**

These uncertainties are estimated varying the value of the renormalisation and factorisation scales by a factor two up and down. This is evaluated by using the internal reweighting technique in the MG5_aMC+Pythia8 sample.

**PDF uncertainties**

Each PDF is accompanied by a set of uncertainties. In addition, there are several PDF sets available. The impact of the choice of the PDF set is derived considering both uncertainties derived from eigenvector sets within a PDF set and from comparisons with other PDF sets. The former are estimated using internal event weights in the nominal sample in which the NNPDF3.0NLO PDF set is used, while the latter will be derived following the LHAPDF prescription [27].

**Showering, hadronisation and underlying event**

The uncertainty due to the model used for the parton showering, hadronisation and underlying event is estimated by comparing MG5_aMC samples interfaced with Pythia8 or with Herwig++.

**Initial and final state radiation (ISR and FSR), and multiparton interactions (MPI)**

Showering settings related to the ISR, FSR and MPI are modified varying the A14 tune parameters for Pythia8. Five pairs of independent parameter variations on the A14 tune were obtained [22] based on the results of the eigentune method. Depending on the details of each analysis, they can be reduced to three pairs of variations roughly corresponding to ISR, FSR and MPI modelling.

### Modelling uncertainties

A dedicated set of studies has been performed to investigate how the renormalisation and factorisation scale choice, parton shower details and the hadronisation and underlying event models impact the description of the \(t\bar{t}H\) signal. The results shown in this section focus on \(t\bar{t}H\) events with \(H\to b\bar{b}\) and \(t\bar{t}\to bq\bar{q}^{\prime}b\nu\), defined at parton level. For this decay mode, six jets are expected per event. The top quarks and the Higgs boson are defined at parton level, while jets originated from the decay of the top quarks or of the Higgs boson and extra jets from QCD radiation are defined at particle level, as described in Section 1.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{l|c|c} \hline \hline \multicolumn{3}{c}{\(t\bar{t}H\), \(\sqrt{s}\)=13 TeV, m\({}_{H}\)= 125 GeV, m\({}_{t}\)= 172.5 GeV} \\ \hline ME gen. & MadGraph5\_aMC@NLO v2.2.1 & MadGraph5\_aMC@NLO v2.3.2 \\  & + MadSpin & + MadSpin \\ \hline PS/UE gen. & Herwig++ & Pythia 8 \\  & v2.7.1 & v8.210 \\ Ren./Fac. scale & \(H_{T}/2\) & \(H_{T}/2\) \\ ME \& PS/UE PDF & CT10nlo \& CTEQ6L1 \\ Tune & UE-EE-5 & A14 \\ Cross-section [pb] & \(0.447\pm 0.007\) & \(0.457\pm 0.001\) \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 3: Summary of the settings used for the simulation of \(t\bar{t}H\) MG5_aMC samples at \(\sqrt{s}=13\) TeV.

Selected jets are required to have \(\pt>25\) and \(|\eta|<2.5\). Each sample is normalised to the appropriate production cross section multiplied by the relevant branching ratios.

#### 2.3.1 QCD scale variations

The theoretical uncertainties due the QCD scale choice are estimated using the reweighting technique, varying the renormalisation and factorisation scale independently by a factor of 0.5 and 2.0 with respect to the central value (\(\HT/2\)). The largest variation is obtained when varying both scales simultaneously in the same direction. Fig. 1 shows the kinematic properties of the undecayed \(t\bar{t}H\) system at parton level, the number of particle jets per event and the scalar sum of their momenta. The jets are required to pass the kinematic cuts described above. The figure demonstrates that the scale choice has no influence on the shape; change of the acceptance is close to 9% when both \(\mu_{R}\) and \(\mu_{F}\) are varied simultaneously in the same direction.

#### 2.3.2 Showering, hadronisation and underlying event model

In this subsection, basic kinematic properties are compared for two different showering, hadronisation and underlying event models: Pythia8 and Herwig++. Fig. 2 shows the differential cross section as function of the number of jets and the scalar sum of their momenta, as well as the kinematics of the \(t\bar{t}H\) system and the transverse momentum spectra of the \(t\bar{t}\) system and of the top quarks. Slightly more events with six jets are observed for MG5_aMC+Pythia8 prediction. In addition, the transverse momenta of the \(t\bar{t}H\) system is harder for Pythia8 and the pseudo-rapidity distribution is more central. The effect is mostly visible in the lower \(p_{T}\) region where a difference close to 50% is observed. Some discrepancies are also seen for the transverse momentum of the jets, the \(t\bar{t}\) system and the Higgs boson, while good agreement is seen in the kinematic properties of the top quarks and their decay products.

#### 2.3.3 ISR, FSR and MPI: A14 eigentune variations

The systematic variations for the A14 tune are evaluated in the following. There are three sets of variations, each of them sensitive to different effects:

* Variation 1 for multiple parton interactions and colour reconnection
* Variation 2 for final state radiation
* Variation 3c for initial state radiation

For each of the variations, hard-process events are showered with modified Pythia8 settings according to the uncertainties derived for A14 tune. The effect of these variations is shown in Fig. 3 for the jet multiplicity and properties of the \(t\bar{t}H\) system. By far the largest impact comes from variation 3c, which corresponds to variations in the initial state radiation. Its impact on the jet multiplicity is up to 5% (10%) for events with one (two) extra jets. In the case of the \(t\bar{t}H\) system, differences of up to 20% are observed in the low \(p_{T}\) region. However, the effect is negligible for the momentum distributions of the jets and the Higgs boson, \(t\bar{t}\) system and top quarks. The impact of multiparton interaction and colour reconnection (variation 1) is almost negligible. The jet multiplicity distribution shows also some sensitivity to final state radiation (variation 2).

Figure 1: Absolute differential cross section as a function of the transverse momenta and the pseudo-rapidity of the \(t\bar{t}H\) system (top) and as a function of the number of jets in the event and the sum of their transverse momenta (bottom) for different scale variations.

Figure 2: Differential cross section as a function of the number of jets in the event and the sum of their transverse momenta (top), as function of the transverse momenta and the pseudo-rapidity of the \(t\bar{t}H\) system (middle) and as a function of the transverse momentum spectra of the \(t\bar{t}\) system and of the top quark for MG5_aMC+Pythia8 and MG5_aMC+Herwig++. The ratio plot shows the difference between the two parton shower, hadronisation and underlying event models. The uncertainty corresponds to the MC statistical uncertainty of the studied sample.

Figure 3: The impact of multiparton interaction and colour reconnection (variation 1), final (variation 2) and initial (variation 3c) state radiation in MG5_aMC+Pythia8 samples with A14 tune. The comparison is performed for the jet multiplicity and \(t\bar{t}H\) system momenta and pseudo-rapidity distributions. The uncertainty corresponds to the MC statistical uncertainty of the studied sample.

## 3 \(t\bar{t}V\)

The expected increased Run 2 data set will allow for precision measurements of the \(t\bar{t}V\) processes where MC simulation is essential for optimisation and correction for acceptances and efficiencies. In addition \(t\bar{t}V\) production is an important background in several BSM searches where the modelling uncertainties can contribute significantly to the total systematic uncertainties.

In the following section details are provided of the MC generator configurations and corresponding MC samples currently considered by ATLAS to model \(t\bar{t}V\) production. Section 3.1 describes the available theoretical calculations of the cross sections used to normalise the MC samples and the corresponding systematic uncertainties. Then Section 3.2 provides details of the various MC generator setups used by ATLAS to simulate \(t\bar{t}W\) and \(t\bar{t}Z\) samples at \(\sqrt{s}=13\) TeV and finally Section 3.3 shows comparisons of the different MC samples for various kinematic distributions.

### Cross section calculations and uncertainties

Cross section calculations have been available for some time at NLO in the strong coupling for \(t\bar{t}W\) at \(\sqrt{s}=7,8,14\) TeV [28] and for both \(t\bar{t}W\) and \(t\bar{t}Z\) at \(\sqrt{s}=7,8\) TeV [29]. Recently the MG5_aMC collaboration published NLO cross section calculations for (amongst other processes) \(t\bar{t}W\) and \(t\bar{t}Z\) at \(\sqrt{s}=13\) TeV.2 These are the cross sections used in the following section and are summarised in Table 4. These NLO cross sections have been confirmed to within 1% with Sherpa[30] calculations using the OpenLoops library [31]. Cross section calculations including electroweak corrections are also available [14] and can have up to a 5% effect on the total cross section, depending on the photon density assumed, but they are not used here.

Footnote 2: Calculations were also performed for these processes with an additional parton, but those are not used in this note.

For the cross section calculations listed in Table 4 the MSTWNL02008 PDF set is used and the quoted uncertainly uses the 68% CL error set. The central renormalisation and factorisation scale choice is \(\mu_{0}=\mu_{R}=\mu_{F}=H_{\rm T}/2\). The scale variations used for the quoted systematic uncertainties are taken from variation of the renormalisation and factorisation scales. Each scale is varied independently up and down by a factor of two.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{l c c c c} \hline \hline Process & \multicolumn{4}{c}{Cross section [pb]} \\  & \multicolumn{2}{c}{LO 13 TeV} & \multicolumn{2}{c}{NLO 13 TeV} \\ \hline \(pp\to t\bar{t}\,W^{\pm}\) & \(3.777\pm 0.003\,\cdot\,10^{-1}\) & \(\begin{array}{c}+23.9\%\ +2.1\%\\ -18.0\%\ -1.6\%\\ -30.5\%\ +1.8\%\end{array}\) & \(5.662\pm 0.021\,\cdot\,10^{-1}\) & \(\begin{array}{c}+11.2\%\ +1.7\%\\ -10.6\%\ -1.3\%\\ -9.7\%\ +1.9\%\\ -11.1\%\ -2.2\%\end{array}\) \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 4: LO and NLO total cross sections for \(t\bar{t}V\) production at \(\sqrt{s}=13\) TeV. The integration errors and fractional QCD scale (left) and PDF (right) uncertainties are also given. All processes are calculated in the five-flavour scheme. All numbers are taken from [10].

### Generated samples

A summary of the produced MC samples, their cross sections, the theoretical NLO cross section in each case and the corresponding normalisaton factor is shown in Table 5. The generator used and the order of the calculation is also given. The normalisation factor is a scaling factor that normalises all the samples to the cross sections given in Table 4.

There are three families of samples:

* LO multileg using MG5_aMC interfaced with Pythia8.
* LO multileg using Sherpa.
* NLO inclusive using MG5_aMC interfaced with Pythia8.

The first two provide a comparison between different multileg generators since for many BSM and Higgs searches accurate modelling of \(t\bar{t}V\) production with extra jets is essential. The third one allows to explore the NLO effects in ME calculation and eventually move towards a setup that uses NLO ME and additional partons.

#### Mg5_aMC+Pythia8 LO multileg

Events are generated using MG5_aMC at LO (with the number of additional partons included in the ME calculation as specified in Table 5 for each process) interfaced with the Pythia8 PS model. The overlap between the additional partons in the ME and additional radiations in the PS is removed by using the CKKW-L[32, 33] merging scheme with a merging scale cut of 30 GeV. The renormalisation and factorisation scale used for the central hard \(2\to 2\) process is set to half the transverse mass of the particles produced in the central process. The central hard process is obtained via a \(k_{\perp}\) clustering inspired by the CKKW method. The NNPDF2.3LO PDF is used in both the ME and PS and the Pythia8 tune is A14. The top quarks are decayed by Pythia8 and therefore the polarisation information and spin correlations are lost.

#### Sherpa LO multileg

Sherpa (v2.2) samples are produced using LO ME with the number of additional partons included in the ME calculation for each process as specified in Table 5 and merged with the Sherpa parton shower[34] using the ME+PS@LO prescription[35]. A dynamic renormalisation scale is used that is defined very similarly to that of the MG5_aMC+Pythia8 LO multileg setup. The NNPDF3.0NLO PDF set is used in conjunction with a dedicated PS tune developed by the Sherpa authors.

#### Mg5_aMC+Pythia8 NLO

Samples taking advantage of the NLO capabilities of the MG5_aMC generator have been produced. The samples are inclusive at NLO in the ME calculation and interfaced with Pythia8. A dynamic renormalisation and factorisation scale is used that is defined as \(H_{\mathrm{T}}/2\). The NNPDF3.0NLO PDF is used in the matrix element. The top quark and vector boson decays are performed with MadSpin such that the spin correlations are preserved. The A14 tune is used in the shower. The same Pythia8 settings are used as described in Section 2.2. In summary, the setup is the same as for the \(t\bar{t}H\) MG5_aMC+Pythia8 sample.

Table 5 shows the cross sections for the samples described above. The NLO cross sections are taken from Table 4 with the appropriate branching ratios taken into account except for \(t\bar{t}\ell\ell\) where the processwas generated separately in order to get the full off-shell \(Z/\gamma^{*}\) contribution which was not present in the calculation used in Table 4.

### Generator comparisons

In this section comparisons between the various samples are shown. The purpose of these studies is to provide a validation of the generators and expose differences in the modelling in each generator setup.

The following studies are presented: validation of the Run 2 setup at \(\sqrt{s}=8\) TeV by comparing with samples used in Run 1, comparisons of \(\sqrt{s}=13\) TeV samples for Run 2 and a first look at estimating the impact of LO scale variations.

#### 3.3.1 Validation of Run 2 samples at \(\sqrt{s}=8\) TeV

Validation of the updated Run 2 MG5_aMC+Pythia8 LO-multileg configuration is performed by comparing with the MadGraph+Pythia6 samples used in Run 1. The validation is performed at \(\sqrt{s}=8\) TeV for \(t\bar{t}\ell\ell\) production.

The generator setups are similar but the Pythia6[36] PS model was used in Run 1 whereas Pythia8 is to be used in Run 2. Also, the scheme for overlap removal between the ME and PS has been updated from the MLM[37] matching scheme in Run 1 to the CKKW-L merging scheme in Run 2. The PDF set used has changed from CTEQ6L1 in Run 1 to NNPDF2.3LO in Run 2.

All these changes mean that some differences are expected. However, the agreement should be reasonable given that the Run 1 samples have been largely used in \(\sqrt{s}=8\) TeV analyses and no significant discrepancies were observed between the predictions and the data, albeit with large uncertainties on the data. The largest discrepancy is expected in jet-based variables where the changes listed above will have the largest effect.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{l l l l l l} \hline \hline Description & & & Xsec [pb] & NLO xsec [pb] & Norm. factor \\ Generator & Order & Process & & & \\ \hline \hline MG5\_aMC+Py8 & LO & \(t\bar{t}W^{\pm}+0,1,2j\) & 0.4534 & 0.5662 & 1.25 \\ Sherpa & LO & \(t\bar{t}W^{\pm}+0,1,2j\) & 0.5773 & 0.5662 & 0.98 \\ MG5\_aMC+Py8 & NLO & \(t\bar{t}W^{\pm}\) & 0.5414 & 0.5662 & 1.05 \\ \hline MG5\_aMC+Py8 & LO & \(t\bar{t}Z\to\nu\nu,qq+0,1,2j\) & 0.5128 & 0.6831 & 1.33 \\ Sherpa & LO & \(t\bar{t}Z\to\nu\nu,qq+0,1,2j\) & 0.6881 & 0.6831 & 0.99 \\ MG5\_aMC+Py8 & NLO & \(t\bar{t}Z\to\nu\nu,qq\) & 0.5384 & 0.6831 & 1.27 \\ \hline MG5\_aMC+Py8 & LO & \(t\bar{t}\ell^{+}\ell^{-}+0,1j\) & 0.0817 & 0.1107\({}^{*}\) & 1.35 \\ Sherpa & LO & \(t\bar{t}\ell^{+}\ell^{-}+0,1j\) & 0.1131 & 0.1107\({}^{*}\) & 0.98 \\ MG5\_aMC+Py8 & NLO & \(t\bar{t}\ell^{+}\ell^{-}\) & 0.1107 & 0.1107\({}^{*}\) & – \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 5: Calculated cross sections at \(\sqrt{s}=13\) TeV for the different processes and generator setups are shown. The order of the calculation and the number of additional partons (\(j\)) are also given. In addition, the corresponding normalisation factor required to scale the samples to the NLO cross section is given. The NLO cross sections are taken from Table 4 (accounting for branching ratios where necessary) except those marked \({}^{*}\) where the NLO cross section from the MG5_aMC+Pythia8 sample is used so that the full \(Z/\gamma^{*}\to\ell^{+}\ell^{-}\) contribution is included.

The analysis was performed using Rivet-2.2.0 [38]. The event selection follows the approach of a typical analysis sensitive to \(t\bar{t}\ell\ell\) as signal or background. Events are required to have \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\) of at least 30 \(\mathrm{\GeV}\) with leptonically decaying \(W\) boson candidates. The same-flavour opposite-sign lepton pair that has an invariant mass closest to the PDG [39] mass of \(Z\)-boson is selected as the \(Z\)-boson candidate. A minimum cut of 10 \(\mathrm{\GeV}\) is applied to the invariant mass of the dilepton system. All jets are required to have a minimum \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) of 25 \(\mathrm{\GeV}\) and \(|\eta|<2.5\), while all leptons are required to have a minimum \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) of 10 \(\mathrm{\GeV}\).

In order to construct the \(t\bar{t}\) system, the event must have at least two light-jets and two \(b\)-jets. First a \(W\) boson candidate is constructed from the two highest \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) light flavoured jets. Hadronic top quark candidates are constructed from the hadronic \(W\) boson candidate and each of the two \(b\)-flavoured jets. Out of the two combinations, the one which has mass closest to the PDG mass of top quark is selected as the top quark candidate. The leptonic top quark is constructed from the leptonic \(W\) boson candidate and the remaining \(b\)-jet. The jet multiplicity distribution is filled before the top reconstruction to be able to compare the region below four jets.

Several kinematic variables are compared in Figure 4 for the \(t\bar{t}e^{+}e^{-}\) channel. The agreement is generally good, although there are some differences in the jet-based kinematic variables. The largest disagreement is observed in the \(H_{\mathrm{T}}\) distributions which is a result of higher jet multiplicity in the MG5_aMC+Pythia8 sample compared to MadGraph+Pythia6. However, as already discussed, some discrepancy is expected due to the parton shower modelling, the matching/merging scheme and the PDF changes between the two samples.

#### 3.3.2 Comparison of \(\sqrt{s}=13\) TeV samples

Having gained some confidence in the Run 2 MG5_aMC+Pythia8 LO multileg setup based on the studies at \(\sqrt{s}=8\) TeV we now consider the relative performance of all three generator setups described in Section 3.2 at \(\sqrt{s}=13\) TeV. These setups are used to simulate samples for four processes: \(t\bar{t}\ell\ell\), \(t\bar{t}Z(\to\nu\nu)\), \(t\bar{t}Z(\to qq)\) and \(t\bar{t}W\).

### \(t\bar{t}\ell\ell\)

Figure 5 shows comparisons of the LO-multileg MG5_aMC+Pythia8 setup against LO-multileg Sherpa and NLO MG5_aMC+Pythia8. The same selection is used as described in Section 3.3.1 except the dilepton system invariant mass which is increased to 30 \(\mathrm{\GeV}\).

In general, good agreement is observed between the two LO-multileg predictions. As can be seen in \(H_{\mathrm{T}}\) distribution, the jets in the LO-multileg MG5_aMC+Pythia8 sample have systematically higher \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) than those in LO-multileg Sherpa and NLO MG5_aMC+Pythia8 samples.

### \(t\bar{t}Z(\to\nu\nu)\)

Figure 6 shows comparisons the LO-multileg MG5_aMC+Pythia8 setup against LO-multileg Sherpa and NLO MG5_aMC+Pythia8 for the \(t\bar{t}Z(\to\nu\nu)\) channel. Rather than using Rivet events simply required to have a semi-leptonic top quark pair decay and the \(Z\) boson decay to neutrinos at parton level. For the jet multiplicity and leading jet \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) distributions, these kinematic cuts are applied to the jets: \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>25\) and \(|\eta|<2.5\).

Figure 4: The new Run 2 MG5_aMC+Pythia8 setup is compared to the previous Run 1 MadGraph+Pythia6 setup at \(\sqrt{s}=8\) TeV. Comparisons of leading jet \(p_{\rm T}\), leading \(b\)-jet \(p_{\rm T}\), \(H_{\rm T}\) and di-electron invariant mass are shown. The lower ratio shows the ratio of the Run 2 setup with respect to the Run 1 setup. The uncertainties shown reflect only the finite sample statistics.

Figure 5: Comparison of LO-multileg MG5_aMC+Pythia8 against inclusive NLO MG5_aMC+Pythia8 and Sherpa for the \(t\bar{t}\ell\ell\) process. The distributions shown are the leading jet and leading \(b\)-jet \(p_{\rm T}\), the jet multiplicity and the scalar sum of jet \(p_{\rm T}\), \(H_{\rm T}\). The lower ratio is calculated with respect to the LO-multileg MG5_aMC+Pythia8 sample. The uncertainties shown reflect only the finite sample statistics.

The agreement is generally good. A systematic shape difference in variables such as \(p_{\rm T}(t\bar{t})\) system and leading jet \(p_{\rm T}\) is observed with the LO-multileg MG5_aMC+Pythia8 sample having higher \(p_{\rm T}\) than the other two setups.

Figure 6: Comparison of LO-multileg MG5_aMC+Pythia8 against LO-multileg Sherpa and NLO MG5_aMC+Pythia8 in the \(t\bar{t}Z(\rightarrow\nu\nu)\) channel. The figures show \(p_{\rm T}(t\bar{t})\) and \(p_{\rm T}(Z)\) along with the jet multiplicity and leading jet \(p_{\rm T}\). The lower ratio is calculated with respect to the LO-multileg MG5_aMC+Pythia8 sample. The uncertainties on the markers reflect only the finite sample statistics.

### \(ttZ(\to qq)\)

Figure 7 shows comparisons of the LO-multileg MG5_aMC+Pythia8 samples against LO-multileg Sherpa and inclusive NLO MG5_aMC+Pythia8. As for other processes, events are required to have a semi-leptonic decay of the top quark pair and the \(Z\) boson decay hadronically at parton level. Thus, events are expected to have on average six jets. Selected jets are required to have \(p_{\rm T}>25\) GeV and \(|\eta|<2.5\).

Similarly to the \(t\bar{t}Z(\to v\nu)\) case the MG5_aMC+Pythia8 LO-multileg sample has slightly higher \(p_{\rm T}(t\bar{t})\) and \(p_{\rm T}(Z)\) than the inclusive NLO MG5_aMC+Pythia8 and Sherpa LO-multileg setups. This is also reflected in the leading and sub-leading jet \(p_{\rm T}\) spectra. The number of jets distribution agrees very well between the two LO-multileg samples but there is a systematically higher jet multiplicity in the NLO MG5_aMC+Pythia8 sample.

Figure 7: Comparison of LO-multileg MG5_aMC+Pythia8 against LO-multileg Sherpa and inclusive NLO MG5_aMC+Pythia8 in the \(t\bar{t}Z(\to qq)\) channel. The figures show \(p_{\rm T}(t\bar{t}t)\), \(p_{\rm T}(Z)\), the jet multiplicity and leading jet \(p_{\rm T}\). The lower ratio is calculated with respect to the LO-multileg MG5_aMC+Pythia8 sample. The uncertainties shown reflect only the finite sample statistics.

### \(t\bar{t}W\)

Figure 8 shows distributions of \(E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}\), \(H_{\rm T}\), jet multiplicity and \(p_{\rm T}(W)\) for \(t\bar{t}W\)production for the LO-multileg MG5_aMC+Pythia8 and Sherpa setups. Unfortunately the MG5_aMC+Pythia8 NLO sample is not yet available. No selection is applied so all decay products of the top quark pair and \(W\) boson are included.

There is a discrepancy in the shape of the jet multiplicity and at low \(H_{\rm T}\), but otherwise the agreement is good between the two LO-multileg generator setups.

Figure 8: Comparison of LO-multileg MG5_aMC+Pythia8 against LO-multileg Sherpa in \(t\bar{t}W\) events. The \(E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}\), \(H_{\rm T}\), jet multiplicity and \(p_{\rm T}(W)\) are shown. The uncertainties shown reflect only the finite sample statistics.

#### 3.3.3 Generator systematic uncertainties

Independent \(t\bar{t}W\) samples with renormalisation and factorisation scale variations were produced for the LO-multileg MG5_aMC+Pythia8 setup. The renormalisation \(\mu_{R}\) and factorisation \(\mu_{F}\) scales are simultaneously varied up and down by a factor of two from the central scale \(\mu_{0}=H_{\mathrm{T}}/2\).

To estimate the impact of the scale uncertainties on quantities commonly used in an analysis, for this study no selection on the decay of the \(t\bar{t}\) system or the associated \(W\) boson is applied. Figure 9 shows the effect of the systematic variation of the renormalisation and factorisation scales for the multiplicity of jets and the effective mass \(M_{\mathrm{eff}}\), defined as the scalar sum of the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) of the jets and leptons in the event and \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\). All samples are normalised to the nominal NLO cross section in Table 4, hence only uncertainties in the shape are considered. A selection sensitive to jets coming from additional partons would see larger uncertainties than those shown here.

## 4 Conclusions

The production of a top quark pair in association with a heavy SM boson (Higgs, \(Z\) or \(W\)) has been studied in this note. Different generator setups have been compared and the evaluation of uncertainties on the modelling has been also reported.

For \(t\bar{t}H\) production, NLO matrix elements generated with MG5_aMC and interfaced to either Pythia 8 or Herwig++ have been compared. Harder distributions are seen in MG5_aMC+Pythia8 case. Scale variations do not affect the shape of the distributions but the acceptance changes are of 9%. Systematic

Figure 9: The effect of the renormalisation and factorisation scale variations on the jet multiplicity and \(M_{\mathrm{eff}}\) for the \(t\bar{t}W\) process. The variations are obtained by coherently varying the two scales by factors of 2.0 and 0.5. The uncertainties shown reflect only the finite sample statistics.

variations for the A14 tune have been studied and the main finding is that variations in the ISR vary the \(t\bar{t}H\) transverse momentum by up to 20%.

For \(t\bar{t}V\) production various generator setups have been compared in preparation for Run 2 ATLAS analyses. A range of updates from the Run 1 setup have been considered, including moving to NLO QCD calculations. More studies are required but these samples constitute the first steps in improving the modelling of this process and reducing the systematic uncertainties associated with the MC samples. This will allow for greater accuracy for measurements and searches that are reliant on the modelling of \(t\bar{t}V\) production.
