Stringent tests on the top decay mechanism are provided by the measurement of the \(W\) boson polarization. We take advantage of the high statistics, high signal over background ratio and relatively easy event topology reconstruction of the semileptonic \(t\bar{t}\) events (\(t\bar{t}\to W^{+}bW^{-}\overline{b}\to l\nu bj_{1}j_{2}\bar{b}\)) to measure the three helicity components of the \(W\): the longitudinal, the left-handed and the right-handed \(F_{0}\), \(F_{L}\) and \(F_{R}\) fractions. This note presents a detailed study of this polarization measurement with the ATLAS detector, using the leptonic decay angle distribution for each fully reconstructed \(t\bar{t}\) event. This study is based on leading-order Monte-Carlo generators and a fast simulation of the detector. \(F_{0}\) (\(F_{L}\)) can be measured with a 3% (10%) accuracy and \(F_{R}\), which is 0 in the Standard Model, with a 1% precision. These results, largely driven by systematic uncertainties, can be achieved in one year at the LHC at low luminosity (10 fb\({}^{-1}\)), including pile-up events. They can be converted into a sensitivity to the magnitude of the effective \(tWb\) couplings that parametrize new physics beyond the Standard Model.

Introduction

Because of its high mass, intriguingly close to the electroweak symmetry breaking scale, the top quark raises a number of interesting questions, and its sector is an ideal place to search for new physics [1, 2]. Consequently, the search for anomalous (i.e. non Standard Model) interactions is one of the main motivations for top quark physics. Among the top couplings to other particles, the \(tWb\) vertex plays a crucial role since it is responsible for practically all top quark decays through \(t\to W^{+}b\) in the Standard Model (SM). Moreover, since the top decays before it can form hadronic bound states [3], its decay products are direct probes of this coupling. The \(W\) polarization in this decay is unambiguously predicted by the SM of electroweak interactions. The measurement of this polarization provides therefore a direct test of our understanding of the \(tWb\) vertex and more particularly of its V-A structure [4, 5].

The real \(W^{+}\) in the \(t\to W^{+}b\) decay can be produced with a longitudinal, left-handed or right-handed helicity. The corresponding probabilities are \(F_{0}\), \(F_{L}\) and \(F_{R}\), respectively, whose expectations from the SM at tree level are:

\[\left\{\begin{array}{l}F_{0}=\frac{M_{t}^{2}}{M_{t}^{2}+2M_{W}^{2}}=0.703+0. 002\times(M_{t}-175)\\ \\ F_{L}=\frac{2M_{W}^{2}}{M_{t}^{2}+2M_{W}^{2}}=0.297-0.002\times(M_{t}-175)\\ \\ F_{R}=0.000\end{array}\right. \tag{1}\]

where \(M_{t}\) and \(M_{W}\) are the top and \(W\) masses. Left and right components are inverted for \(W^{-}\) bosons. By definition, we have the restriction \(F_{0}+F_{L}+F_{R}=1\). As sketched in Figure 1, right-handed \(W^{+}\) bosons do not exist in the zero \(b\)-mass approximation, due to angular momentum conservation (a massless \(b\)-quark must be left-handed). Including QCD and electroweak radiative corrections, finite width corrections and non-zero \(b\)-quark mass induces a small variation: \(F_{0}=0.695\), \(F_{L}=0.304\) and \(F_{R}=0.001\) for M\({}_{t}=175\) GeV [6]. Because the top quark is very heavy, \(F_{0}\) is large and top decay is the only significant source of longitudinal \(W\) bosons1. Deviations of \(F_{0}\) from its SM value would bring into question the validity of the Higgs mechanism of the spontaneous symmetry breaking, responsible for the longitudinal degree of freedom of the massive gauge bosons. Any deviation of \(F_{R}\) from zero could point to a non-SM V+A admixture to the standard left-handed weak current, as for example predicted by \(SU(2)_{L}\times SU(2)_{R}\times U(1)\) extensions of the SM.

Footnote 1: QCD production, the only other source of real \(W\) bosons, produces nearly all transversely \(W\).

CDF and D0 published first measurements of the \(W\) polarization in \(t\bar{t}\) pairs based on Run I data [7, 8, 9]. For example, CDF results are \(F_{0}=0.91\pm 0.37\)(stat)\(\pm 0.13\)(syst) and \(F_{R}=0.11\pm 0.15\). They are largely limited by statistical errors2. Preliminary studies started with Run IIa data [10], but statistical errors will remain large, 0.09 and 0.03 for \(F_{0}\) and \(F_{R}\) re spectively, even with the total integrated luminosity of 2 fb\({}^{-1}\)[11].

The LHC will be a top factory, allowing a more precise measurement of the \(W\) polarization. A first study with single top events [12] (cross-section around 300 pb) indicates the ATLAS capability to measure \(F_{0}\), \(F_{L}\) and \(F_{R}\) with 30 fb\({}^{-1}\) within a statistical error of 0.015, 0.010 and 0.018, respectively3. One of the main problem in this channel is the relatively poor signal over background ratio (\(\sim\)2.3). In contrary, \(t\bar{t}\) pairs offer a higher cross-section (850 pb), and a cleaner signature (better S/B). The goal of this paper is to take advantage of these features, and evaluate the level of precision to which the \(W\) polarization can be measured in \(t\bar{t}\) pairs.

Footnote 3: 30 fb\({}^{-1}\) corresponds to three years at low luminosity.

We already reported on the sensitivity of the ATLAS detector to measure the spin correlation between top and anti-top quarks in semileptonic \(t\bar{t}\) pairs [13] (\(t\bar{t}\to WbW\overline{b}\to l\nu bj_{1}j_{2}\overline{b}\)), including a complete study of systematic uncertainties. Spin correlations allow to test both the top production and decay processes, but in an intricate manner. Measuring the \(W\) polarization with the same events provide an independent test of the decay in case of deviation from the SM. Hence, the study of \(W\) polarization complements the spin correlation measurement helping to disentangle the origin of new physics, if observed.

The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 explains the method to measure the \(W\) polarization in top decays. Section 3 presents a complete study of the systematic uncertainties and give the results. From these results, the sensitivity to the magnitude of the \(tWb\) anomalous couplings that parametrize new physics is extracted in section 4. Section 5 is dedicated to the conclusions.

## 2 \(W\) polarization measurement

### \(W\) polarization observables

The best way to access particle spin information is to measure the angular distribution of its decay products, thereby called spin analyzers. As an example, illustrated in Figure 2, the charged lepton from the decay of longitudinally polarized \(W^{+}\) tends to be emitted transversally to the \(W^{+}\) direction, due to angular momentum conservation. Similarly, the charged lepton from a left-handed (right-handed) \(W^{+}\) is preferentially emitted in the opposite (same) \(W^{+}\) direction, leading to a softer (harder) \(\mathrm{p}_{T}\) spectrum with respect to the leptons from longitudinal \(W^{+}\)4. The resulting angular distributions are therefore very distinct for each helicity state.

Footnote 4: This explains easily that a cut on the lepton \(\mathrm{p}_{T}\) will bias our measurements (section 2.3).

As it is necessary to know the weak isospin of the \(W\) spin analyzer, the charged lepton is the best choice since \(u\)-like jets can not be distinguished experimentally from \(d\)-like jets. Consequently, the \(W\) polarization will be measured through the distribution of the angle, \(\Psi\), between the charged lepton direction in the \(W\) rest frame and the \(W\) direction in the top quark rest frame5[4]:

Footnote 5: The \(W\) direction will decompose the polarization in helicity states.

\[\frac{1}{N}\frac{dN}{d\cos\Psi}=\frac{3}{2}\left[F_{0}\left(\frac{\sin\Psi}{ \sqrt{2}}\right)^{2}+F_{L}\left(\frac{1-\cos\Psi}{2}\right)^{2}+F_{R}\left( \frac{1+\cos\Psi}{2}\right)^{2}\right] \tag{2}\]

Figure 3 shows this angular distribution at parton level. It reflects the superposition of the three terms of Equation (2), corresponding to the longitudinal \((\sin\Psi)^{2}\), the left-handed \((1-\cos\Psi)^{2}\) and the right-handed \((1+\cos\Psi)^{2}\) helicity states. Each term is weighted by its SM fraction expectation, \(F_{0}\), \(F_{L}\) and \(F_{R}\), given in Equation (1).

Figure 2: _Sketches of the different \(W^{+}\) polarization modes in \(t\to W^{+}b\) decay and resulting lepton directions. Simple black (open red) arrows denote particle direction of motion (spin). For \(W^{-}\), left and right-handed components are inverted._The \(\Psi\) angle measurement requires a complete event topology reconstruction, as the \(W\) and top rest frames are needed. This is rather easy in semileptonic \(t\overline{t}\) events, with only one neutrino in the final state and a high signal over background ratio [13]. At the Tevatron [7] and for single top analysis at LHC [12], the event reconstruction is more challenging. Therefore the \(\Psi\) angle is reconstructed with the invariant mass of the lepton and the \(b\)-quark, \(M_{lb}\)[4]:

\[\cos\Psi\sim\frac{2M_{lb}^{2}}{M_{t}^{2}-M_{W}^{2}}-1 \tag{3}\]

which is valid in the zero \(b\)-mass limit, and where \(M_{t}\) and \(M_{W}\) are set to 175 GeV and 80.41 GeV 6. The main drawback of this approach is a higher dependence to the jet energy scale and to the top mass. On the contrary, these two dependences cancel at first order when measuring directly \(\cos\Psi\)7.

Footnote 6: An even cruder estimator, the lepton p\({}_{T}\), was used by CDF, exploiting the different lepton spectra from the three \(W\) helicity modes [8].

Footnote 7: The overall systematic uncertainty obtained with \(\cos\Psi\) (see section 3) is two times lower than that obtained using the \(M_{lb}^{2}\) variable.

### Event simulation, selection and reconstruction

With a cross-section around 850 pb, 3.8 millions of \(t\bar{t}\) semileptonic events will be produced per year at the LHC at low luminosity (\(10^{33}\) cm\({}^{-2}\)s\({}^{-1}\), 10 fb\({}^{-1}\)). Among them, 2.5 millions are signal events, defined as:

\[t\bar{t}\to WbW\bar{b}\to l\nu bj_{1}j_{2}\bar{b} \tag{4}\]

with \(l=e\),\(\mu\).

Background events can be divided in two categories:

* \(t\bar{t}\) background, which includes the 1.3 million semileptonic decay with \(l=\tau\) in (4) and \(t\bar{t}\) non-semileptonic decay (dileptonic and all hadronic cases).
* Non-\(t\bar{t}\) background, which is mainly composed of \(W\)+4 jets, \(b\bar{b}\), \(Z(\to ll)+\)jets, \(Wb\bar{b}\) and 2 vector bosons (\(ZZ\),\(ZW\),\(WW\)).

The signal and background samples of the present analysis are those generated for our study on \(t\bar{t}\) spin correlation [13]. To estimate the systematic uncertainties due to the parton generation, three LO generators, TopReX 4.05 [14], AlpGen 1.33 [15] and AcerMC 2.2 [16], are used. A top mass of 175 GeV is assumed and the structure function CTEQ5L [17] is chosen. Partons are fragmented and hadronized using PYTHIA 6.2 [18] or HERWIG 6.5 [19]. Initial and final state radiations are switched on. \(\tau\) decay and radiative corrections are performed with TAUOLA and PHOTOS [20]. A simplified modeling of the ATLAS detector, ATLFAST 2.6.0 [21], is used. This essentially accounts for resolution smearing of objects accepted within the detector geometry, according to the expected performance [22]. A luminosity of \(10^{33}\)cm\({}^{-2}\)s\({}^{-1}\) is assumed and no pile-up events are superimposed. The influence of pile-up events will be discussed in section 3.3. No trigger inefficiencies are applied, and no detailed acceptance (as crack between barrel and endcap cryostat) is included. A 100% electron, muon and jet efficiency is assumed.

As already stated, the study of the \(W\) polarization complements \(t\bar{t}\) spin correlation measurements. Therefore, events are selected and reconstructed as detailed in [13]. Semileptonic signal events are characterized by one (and only one) isolated lepton, at least 4 jets of which 2 are \(b\)-jets, and one neutrino (missing energy). The \(W\) which decays leptonically is reconstructed from \(\mathrm{p}_{T}^{miss}\) and the charged lepton with the mass constraint M\({}_{l\nu}\)=M\({}_{W}^{PDG}\). The cuts applied on the reconstructed objects are summarized in Table 18. Their overall efficiency is 4.5%, leaving 115 000 events per year at the LHC at low luminosity (10 fb\({}^{-1}\)). 80% of the background is composed of \(t\bar{t}\rightarrow\tau+X\) events. The remaining non-\(t\bar{t}\) background is dominated by \(W(\to l\nu)+\)4 jets and \(b\bar{b}\) events, and will be neglected in the rest of the analysis. The expected overall signal over background ratio is around 12.

Footnote 8: They are the same than those used in [13], except that a cut on the reconstructed invariant mass of the \(t\bar{t}\) system, M\({}_{t\bar{t}}<550\) GeV, was performed to increase the spin correlation effect. It has no reason in the present analysis, and therefore is not applied.

### Measurement method

As charged leptons from longitudinal \(W\) have a harder p\({}_{T}\) spectrum than those from left-handed W, they are more likely to pass the selection requirements. The reconstructed \(\cos\Psi\) angular distribution is thus distorted compared to the parton level one, as shown in Figure 4. This results into a bias in the measurement. This bias is more and more pronounced when the cut on the lepton p\({}_{T}\) increases. To correct for it, a weight is applied event by event, allowing to recover, as much as possible, the original shape. The weighting function is obtained from the ratio between the two normalized distributions of Figure 4 (i.e. after selection and at parton level). This ratio, shown in Figure 5, is fitted by a third order polynomial function to extract a smooth correction. It has been checked that adding parameters does not improve the fit, and less parameters degrade the results. The fit is restricted to the region \(-0.9<\cos\Psi<0.9\), which is the most extended region where the correction is varying slowly.

The correction function is computed on a specific sample, and will be applied event by event on all the other samples. The final distribution after event selection and correction is shown in Figure 6 for the TopReX sample, corresponding to one year at low luminosity, 10 fb\({}^{-1}\). The \(W\) polarization is extracted from a fit in the restricted region with the function of Equation (2), with the only constraint \(F_{0}+F_{L}+F_{R}=1\). The results for \(F_{0}\), \(F_{L}\) and \(F_{R}\) are compatible with their SM expectations. The statistical errors are 0.005 for \(F_{0}\) and 0.003 for \(F_{L}\) and \(F_{R}\). The correlation between the parameters for the couples (\(F_{0}\),\(F_{L}\)), (\(F_{0}\),\(F_{R}\)) and (\(F_{L}\),\(F_{R}\)) are -0.9, -0.8 and 0.4, respectively.

The error coming from the method has been estimated by varying the number of bins (from 40 to 25), the fit limits (from [-0.9;0.9] to [-0.8;0.8] and [-0.95;0.95]) and the polynomial order (from P3 to P5 and P7). All errors are below 0.006 for \(F_{0}\), and 0.004 for \(F_{L}\) and \(F_{R}\). Therefore, the uncertainty of the method is estimated to be smaller than the statistical error.

The above correction function (Figure 5) has been extracted from a SM scenario, assuming a pure V-A top decay vertex. In case of deviation from the SM, the kinematic distributions, as lepton p\({}_{T}\) or angles, could be affected. This is for example the case if a V+A component is added. In such a scenario, the fraction of longitudinal \(W\) would be unchanged, but a right

component \(F_{R}\), whose lepton spectrum is harder (section 2.1), would appear. As a consequence, the correction function would be changed. This is illustrated in Figure 7 for different \(F_{R}\) input values. In each case, the statistics of one year at the LHC has been generated with AlpGen. Applying the SM correction function to these samples would therefore not correct completely for the bias induced by the selection cuts. Figure 8 shows the fraction \(F_{R}\) extracted from the fit9 as a function of the \(F_{R}\) input value after applying the SM correction function (open circles). The measurement is clearly biased, and to overcome this problem we proceed iteratively: _i)_ first, the SM correction is used. _ii)_ In case of deviation of \(F_{R}\) from zero, a new correction function is calculated with this new \(F_{R}\) component, and applied. The process converges after 1, 2 or 3 iterations, as shown in Figure 8.

Systematic uncertainties and overall results

This section presents a detailed study of the systematic uncertainties associated with the \(W\) polarization measurements. To reduce the influence of statistical errors, samples corresponding to three years at the LHC at low luminosity (30 fb\({}^{-1}\)) are generated for each source of systematic uncertainties.

### Systematic uncertainties from Monte-Carlo

In this subsection, five most relevant sources of systematic uncertainties are considered:

* Parton generation: The uncertainties related to the parton generation are estimated by comparing AcerMC and AlpGen results with TopReX ones. In all cases, the same hadronization scheme (PYTHIA) is used. The corresponding systematic uncertainties are presented in Figure 10. The main differences arise from AcerMC, whose generated p\({}_{T}\) spectrum is harder compared to TopReX and AlpGen [13], resulting in an increase of \(F_{R}\) and \(F_{0}\) and a decrease of \(F_{L}\).
* Structure function: The impact of structure function is estimated by the maximum difference between the measurements obtained with the standard PDF (CTEQ5L) and three other ones, CTEQ6L [23], MRST2002 [24] and GRV98 [25]. Results are given in Figure 10.
* ISR, FSR: The presence of initial state radiations (ISR) from incoming partons and final state radiations (FSR) can affect the \(\Psi\) angle reconstruction. To estimate the effect due to ISR, the difference between the measurements obtained with ISR switched on (usual data set) and off is computed. The same approach is used for FSR. The level of knowledge of ISR and FSR is around 10%. Therefore, as a more conservative estimate, the systematics uncertainties have been taken to be 20% of the corresponding differences. Results are given in Table 2. It should be noted that more sophisticated methods exist to make this evaluation [26].
* \(b\)-fragmentation: The \(b\)-quark fragmentation is performed according to the Peterson parametrization 10, with one free parameter \(\epsilon_{b}\). The default value is set to \(\epsilon_{b}=-0.006\). It has been changed to a more recent LEP value (\(\epsilon_{b}=-0.0035\)[28]), and the differences on the results are taken as systematic uncertainties. Footnote 10: It has to be noticed that recent measurements can not be well fit tted with the Peterson parametrization [27].
* Hadronization scheme: The angular distributions of jets and leptons may be influenced by the hadronization scheme. Generating partons with AcerMC and hadronizing them with PYTHIA or HERWIG lead to different \(W\) polarization results. The related systematic uncertainties are extracted from these differences and are given in Table 2.

### Systematic uncertainties from reconstruction

The systematics coming from the reconstruction will mainly affect the \(W\) and top boost measurements and consequently \(\cos\Psi\). In this subsection, three most relevant sources of systematic uncertainties are considered:

* \(b\)-tagging: The impact of the \(b\)-tagging efficiency has been studied by varying it from 50% to 70% by steps of 5%, according to a parametrization coming from full simulation [29]. Increasing (decreasing) the \(b\)-tagging efficiency degrades (improves) the \(c\)-jets and light jets rejection factors. As an example, going from 60% to 55% increases them respectively by 30% and 80%. Figure 9 (a) shows \(F_{L}\), \(F_{0}\) and \(F_{R}\) measurements as a function of the \(b\)-tagging efficiency. Small and smooth dependences are observed. The related error is computed by varying the \(b\)-tagging efficiency by \(\pm\)5% (Table 2).
* \(b\)-jet miscalibration: The impact of the knowledge of the absolute \(b\)-jet energy scale is estimated by miscalibrating the reconstructed \(b\)-jet energy. Results are shown in Figure 9 (b), for a miscalibration between \(\pm\)5%. The behaviors can be easily understood: a positive miscalibration overestimates the invariant mass of the lepton and the \(b\)-quark, \(M_{lb}\) and therefore \(\cos\Psi\) (Equation 3), biasing the polarization toward higher values (\(F_{L}\) decreases and \(F_{R}\) increases). Taking a realistic \(\pm\)3% uncertainty on the \(b\)-jet energy scale results in an uncertainty of 0.005 on \(F_{0}\) and \(F_{R}\) and 0.011 on \(F_{L}\). This assumption is discussed in section 3.4. Similarly, the effect of the light jet energy scale has been estimated. As expected, it has a negligible impact on the \(W\) polarization.
* Input top mass: The SM \(W\) polarization depends on the top mass with a small decrease (increase) of \(F_{L}\) (\(F_{0}\)) by 0.002 per GeV (Equation (1)). Moreover, a 175 GeV top mass value is assumed in the event reconstruction, which can impact the \(\cos\Psi\) measurement if the real top mass is different. Therefore, different samples of events were generated with a top mass between 170 and 180 GeV by steps of 2.5 GeV. Results are shown in Figure 9 (c). As for the case of a positive \(b\)-jet miscalibration, a high input top mass increases \(M_{lb}\), and therefore bias the polarization toward higher values. The related systematics are -0.008 per GeV on \(F_{L}\), 0.006 on \(F_{0}\) and 0.002 on \(F_{R}\). As expected, this is much lower than in Tevatron analysis (\(0.01-0.02\) per GeV on \(F_{R}\)), as they only use the invariant mass \(M_{lb}\) or the lepton p\({}_{T}\) (section 2.1). The final uncertainty is computed assuming \(\Delta\)M\({}_{\rm top}\)=2 GeV, which should be reached at Tevatron run II [30]. This assumption is discussed in section 3.4.

### Other sources of systematic uncertainties

* Background: As shown in section 2.2, the only sizable background comes from \(t\bar{t}\to\tau+X\) events, and is well under control. A large variation of this background level by \(\pm\)10% has a negligeable impact on the results.
* Pile-up: Pile-up events may influence the reconstruction and therefore impact on \(W\) polarization measurement. They are generated with PYTHIA setting MSTP(131)=1 and usingFigure 9: _Measured \(F_{L}\) (left), \(F_{0}\) (middle) and \(F_{R}\) (right) as a function of different parameters (see text for more details). Linear fits are superimposed in each case, and the corresponding slope is indicated._

the default process definition MSTP(132)=4. Because no vertexing is performed in ATLFAST, the primary vertex was not smeared along the \(z\) direction. Different samples were generated adding 2.3 or 4.6 pile-up events according to the Poisson law. These numbers are expected for a luminosity of \(10^{33}\)cm\({}^{-2}\)s\({}^{-1}\) and \(2\times 10^{33}\)cm\({}^{-2}\)s\({}^{-1}\), respectively. Results are shown in Figure 9 (d). The systematic uncertainty given in Table 2 correspond to the first case. It can be noticed that these results are conservative, as no jet recalibration is applied.

### Systematics summary

All systematic uncertainties are listed in Table 2 and illustrated in Figure 10. Monte-Carlo and reconstruction sources contribute roughly in the same proportion to the total error. The dominant Monte-Carlo contributions come from the parton generation, the hadronization scheme and the FSR knowledge, while the reconstruction systematics are dominated by the top mass uncertainty.

The above results were obtained assuming realistic uncertainties of 3% on the \(b\)-jet energy scale and 2 GeV on the top mass. With more pessimistic assumptions (5% and 3 GeV), the total systematic errors on \(F_{L}\), \(F_{0}\) and \(F_{R}\) would increase to 0.036, 0.027 and 0.016. On the contrary, with more optimistic assumptions (1% and 1 GeV), the total systematic errors on \(F_{L}\), \(F_{0}\) and \(F_{R}\) would decrease to 0.023, 0.021 and 0.012. We can notice that the errors, mainly those on \(F_{0}\) and \(F_{R}\), only weakly depend on these assumptions, assessing the robustness of the result.

### Results

Table 3 presents the expected SM results for the \(W\) polarization measurement in \(t\overline{t}\) semileptonic channel after one year at the LHC at low luminosity (\(10^{33}\)cm\({}^{-2}\)s\({}^{-1}\), 10 fb\({}^{-1}\)). The sensitivity is driven by the systematic uncertainties, which largely dominates the statistical ones. It allows to measure \(F_{0}\), \(F_{L}\) and \(F_{R}\) with a precision (stat.+syst.) of 0.024, 0.028 and 0.013, respectively. It is worth to notice that \(F_{R}\), which is expected to be zero in the SM, is the most precisely measured, allowing a good sensitivity to physics beyond the SM. This result is roughly 3 times better than Tevatron run II expectations with 2 fb\({}^{-1}\) (\(\sim\) 0.04 (stat.+syst.) on \(F_{R}\)[31] and \(\sim\) 0.09 (stat. only) on \(F_{0}\)[32]). It is also two times better than the statistical error foreseen with single top events (\(\sim\) 0.03 on \(F_{R}\) with 10 fb\({}^{-1}\)) [12].

All above results were obtained with a \(10^{33}\)cm\({}^{-2}\)s\({}^{-1}\) luminosity. The luminosity may be \(2\cdot 10^{33}\)cm\({}^{-2}\)s\({}^{-1}\) at the LHC start. In this case, two scenarii are considered in ATLAS: increase of the electron p\({}_{T}\) cut at the trigger level from 20 to 25 GeV (scenario 1), or even to 30 GeV (scenario 2). The complete study has been redone for both scenarii, assuming the same hypothesis for each source of systematic uncertainty presented in Figure 10. The number of events would be multiplied by 1.8 (1.6) for scenario 1 (scenario 2), while systematic errors remain almost unchanged. Consequently, the same precision is achieved on the \(W\) polarization measurement. At high luminosity, \(10^{34}\)cm\({}^{-2}\)s\({}^{-1}\), a possible improvement could be to consider leptonic final states with J/\(\psi\), in a similar way as what is performed for the top mass measurement [33].

The forward-backward asymmetry (\(A_{FB}\)), based on the angle between the charged lepton and the \(b\)-jet in the \(W\) rest frame, is often discussed in literature [34]. It can be expressed in terms of \(F_{L}\) and \(F_{R}\)[6]:

\[A_{FB}=\frac{3}{4}\left(F_{L}-F_{R}\right) \tag{5}\]

Taking the correlation between \(F_{L}\) and \(F_{R}\) into account, we can extract from our results the following measurement on \(A_{FB}\):

\[A_{FB}=0.223\pm 0.003(\mbox{stat})\pm 0.019(\mbox{syst}) \tag{6}\]

It is clear that it does not provide any more information than the separate measurements of the ratios \(F_{L}\) and \(F_{R}\).

As already stated in the introduction, the search for anomalous (i.e. non Standard Model) interactions is one of the main motivations for top quark physics. The measurement of the \(W\) polarization provides a direct test of our understanding of the \(tWb\) vertex, responsible for practically all top quark decays. The deviations from the SM expectations induced by new physics contributions have been calculated in the framework of a few models [35, 36, 37, 38]. However, because of the great diversity of models beyond the SM (MSSM, technicolor, top-condensate, top-color models,... ), it is useful to study these possible new interactions in a model independent approach [5, 39, 40]. We can parametrize the unknown dynamics with couplings (see appendix 1 for more details) representing the strength of effective interactions, through the following Lagrangian [4]:

\[\mathcal{L}=\frac{g}{\sqrt{2}}W_{\mu}^{-}\bar{b}\gamma^{\mu}(f_{1}^{L}P_{L}+f_ {1}^{R}P_{R})t-\frac{g}{\sqrt{2}\Lambda}\partial_{v}W_{\mu}^{-}\bar{b}\sigma^ {\mu\nu}(f_{2}^{L}P_{L}+f_{2}^{R}P_{R})t+h.c. \tag{7}\]

where \(P_{R/L}=\frac{1}{2}(1\pm\gamma_{5})\), \(\sigma^{\mu\nu}=\frac{i}{2}[\gamma^{\mu},\gamma^{\nu}]\), \(g\) is the electroweak coupling constant and \(\Lambda\) is the energy scale to which the new physics becomes apparent (in the following, we set \(\Lambda=M_{W}\) to keep the notation used in the literature). \(f_{1}^{L}\) and \(f_{1}^{R}\) are vector-like couplings, whereas \(f_{2}^{L}\) and \(f_{2}^{R}\) are tensor-like couplings. This is the most general CP-conserving Lagrangian11, keeping only the leading (mass dimension 4, first term) and the next-to-leading (mass dimension 5, second term) effective operators in the low energy expansion. In the SM, the values of the couplings at tree level are \(f_{1}^{L}=V_{tb}=1\), \(f_{1}^{R}=f_{2}^{L}=f_{2}^{R}=0\).

Footnote 11: At our level of precision, it is an excellent approximation to consider all particles on shell. Assuming CP conservation implies that the couplings are real, of either sign.

We will first show how the measurement of the \(W\) polarization in top decays can probe these anomalous couplings (section 4.1) and then review their existing direct and indirect experimental limits (section 4.2).

### Probe of \(tWb\) anomalous couplings with \(W\) polarization

The contributions of \(f_{1}^{L}\), \(f_{1}^{R}\), \(f_{2}^{L}\) and \(f_{2}^{R}\) anomalous couplings to the \(W\) polarization have been calculated at LO [4, 41] and at NLO [34], NLO effects being small. They are given in appendix 1 for each fraction of helicity state, \(F_{0}\), \(F_{L}\) and \(F_{R}\). A deviation of \(f_{1}^{L}\) from 1 has not been considered, as the \(W\) helicity is not sensitive to it. This can be easily understood, as \(f_{1}^{L}\) is proportional to \(V_{tb}\), which can not be measured with \(t\overline{t}\) pairs but only with single top cross section.

In the following, we will assume a deviation of each anomalous coupling, \(f_{1}^{R}\), \(f_{2}^{L}\) and \(f_{2}^{R}\) independently. Figure 11 shows the variation of \(F_{0}\), \(F_{L}\) and \(F_{R}\) with these couplings. \(F_{L}\) and \(F_{R}\) depend quadratically on \(f_{1}^{R}\), whereas \(F_{0}\) remains unchanged. Similarly, the three fractions of helicity states are sensitive to \(f_{2}^{L}\), in a quadratic way. In these two cases, the sign of the coupling can not be determined and the sensitivity will be lowered by the quadratic behavior. The last case is the most interesting: \(F_{0}\) and \(F_{L}\) depend almost linearly (slope\(=\)0.7, see Appendix 1) on

Full lines indicate the overall (statistics\(+\)systematics) sensitivity, while dashed lines represent the statistical sensitivity only._\((3.28\pm 0.33)\times 10^{-4}\)[43]. The related limits on anomalous couplings are stringent : as an example, \(f_{1}^{R}\) has to be less than 0.004 [44] at 95% C.L.13. Electroweak measurements from LEP/SLC give weaker indirect limits (\(tWb\) coupling appears in loop in \(Z\) decay). However, all these limits are indirect, SM-dependent, and scenarii can be envisaged where other contributions to \(b\to s\gamma\) lead to cancellations that invalidate these bounds.

Footnote 13: This limit is derived in the absence of a CP-violating imaginary part of \(f_{1}^{R}\). The limit on the real and imaginary parts of \(f_{1}^{R}\) are \(-0.0035<Re(f_{1}^{R})+20|f_{1}^{R}|^{2}<0.0039\).

The only existing direct limits can be placed from Tevatron \(W\) polarization measurements in \(t\overline{t}\) pairs. As outlined in section 1, the main limitation comes from the poor statistics14. From run II expectations, one can be sensitive to \(f_{1}^{R}\sim 0.5\) and \(f_{2}^{L,R}\sim 0.3\)[41] at 95% C.L. The single top, which has not been experimentally observed so far, can provide further constraints on the \(tWb\) anomalous couplings, from its production rate and kinematic distributions. At Tevatron, the expected \(2\sigma\) limits are \(-0.18<f_{2}^{L}<0.55\) and \(-0.24<f_{2}^{R}<0.25\), with 2 fb\({}^{-1}\) and assuming a 10% systematic uncertainty [45]. Similarly, at LHC, measurements on single top with 100 fb\({}^{-1}\) (one year at high luminosity) could provide the \(2\sigma\) limits \(-0.052<f_{2}^{L}<0.097\) and \(-0.12<f_{2}^{R}<0.13\)[45], assuming a 5% systematic uncertainty, and a statistical sensitivity to \(f_{1}^{R}\sim 0.06\)[46]. All these studies do not include any detector effect and detailed evaluation of systematic uncertainties. In any case, the \(W\) polarization measurement in \(t\overline{t}\) pairs and the single top studies will be complementary to determine precisely the structure of the \(tWb\) vertex [41].

Footnote 14: \(F_{R}<0.18\) at 95% C.L. [7] translates in \(f_{1}^{R}<0.8\).

Conclusions

The measurement of the \(W\) polarization in top decays offers an opportunity to test precisely the \(tWb\) vertex and thus to observe possible deviations from the Standard Model. It is complementary to single top cross section measurements, as NLO QCD corrections and theoretical errors are much smaller, of the order of 1%.

The ATLAS capability to measure the \(W\) polarization components \(F_{0}\), \(F_{L}\) and \(F_{R}\) (for longitudinal, left-handed and right-handed helicity fractions) has been studied, for the first time, in semileptonic \(t\bar{t}\) events with leading-order Monte-Carlo generators and a fast simulation of the detector. Selection and reconstruction bias this measurement. A method was set up to correct for it, and its robustness assessed. The clean signature of \(t\bar{t}\) events, high statistics (115 000 signal events after selection and reconstruction in one year at low luminosity, \(10^{33}\)cm\({}^{-2}\)s\({}^{-1}\)) and high S/B (more than 10) are attractive features compared to single top analysis.

An absolute precision around 0.01, 0.02 and 0.03 on the Standard Model \(F_{R}\), \(F_{0}\) and \(F_{L}\), respectively, can be achieved in one year at the LHC at low luminosity (10 fb\({}^{-1}\)), including pile-up events. The sensitivity is driven by the systematic uncertainties, which largely dominates the statistical errors. Monte-Carlo and reconstruction sources contribute in the same proportion to the total uncertainty. Main contributions arise from the parton generation, hadronization scheme and top mass uncertainty. Other hypothesis for systematic uncertainties and trigger scenarii impact very weakly on this result. It is roughly 3 times better than Tevatron Run II expectations with 2 fb\({}^{-1}\).

This precision sets the limit of sensitivity to physics beyond the Standard Model, which is studied in a model independent approach. Three \(tWb\) anomalous couplings, which parametrize new physics, are introduced, \(f_{1}^{R}\), \(f_{2}^{L}\) and \(f_{2}^{R}\). They can be expressed in terms of \(F_{0}\), \(F_{L}\) and \(F_{R}\), and the related ATLAS potential for measuring them or putting bounds (2\(\sigma\) limit) is: 0.31, 0.14 and 0.07 for \(f_{1}^{R}\), \(f_{2}^{L}\) and \(f_{2}^{R}\) respectively. This is competitive with expectations from single top measurements which use 10 times more statistics (LHC high luminosity).
