###### Abstract

The uniformity of the barrel Module 0 light yield was studied using three sources of information: 180GeV muons impinging the Module 0 at 90\({}^{\circ}\), the cesium source and the light yield calculated using a parametrization for tiles and fibres. The cesium source and muons give an average 'tile-to-tile' fluctuation of \(\sim\pm 8\%\) while the maximum fluctuation on the calculated light yield is \(\sim\pm 5\%\). The number of photoelectrons per tile size was calculated using the data from the detailed muons scan and a mean number of \(\sim 27\) photoelectrons per GeV was obtained for the Module 0.

The uniformity of the response of the Module 0 to 180 GeV muons and 100GeV pions was studied as a function of the impact point z and \(\eta\). The signal response shows a modulation for \(\eta\) values close to zero which is a consequence of the structural periodicity of the Module 0. The maximum fluctuation on the signal is \(\sim\pm 50-60\%\) of the energy lost by muons in the Module 0 for \(\eta\)=0. The amplitude of the modulation is smaller for pions because the dimension of the showers makes them less sensitive to the local structure.

Introduction

The Tile calorimeter prototype was exposed to beams of particles at the CERN SPS H8 beam in September 1996, and the barrel module 0, the real scale prototype of a barrel module, was tested for the first time in that period. The calorimeter was tested without the Liquid Argon e.m. calorimeter in front, i.e. in a "standalone" mode. The experimental setup is shown and described in section 2.

The main task of the Tile Calorimeter is to contribute to the energy reconstruction of jets and to provide a good \(E_{T}^{miss}\) measurement. Another requirement is the \(\mu/\pi\) separation.

The response of the barrel module 0 to muons and pions has been studied. In this note it is presented, in section 3, a study of the optical performance of the 1996 Tilecal prototype, that includes the study of the uniformity of the light yield produced by muons and compared with the light yield produced by the Cesium source and with the light budget calculations. In section 4 it is presented a calculation of the number of photoelectrons per unity of deposited energy \((N_{phe}/GeV)_{\rm,}\) as determined from 180GeV muons hitting the modules at 90\({}^{0}\). The study of the barrel module 0 to muons and the \(\eta\) uniformity of the barrel module 0 to pions and muons is presented in the next sections. The data obtained in the test beam is compared with MC simulation. The test beam setup was simulated in the framework of GEANT3.21 [1] using DICE [2, 3] to simulate the geometry. The GCALOR [4] package was used to simulate the hadronic interactions.

The simulation program is not complete and many features of the module 0 are not yet implemented in the simulation source code, namely:

* The fluctuations on the response of the fibers and tiles, including tile-to-tile fluctuations, fiber-to-fiber fluctuations, etc;
* The electronics of the read-out system, including the photostatistic effect and the electronic noise effect in the response of the module 0 to the beam of particles.

The uniformity response of the barrel module 0 to 180GeV muons and 100GeV pions has been studied as a function of the impact point in the front face of the module and the pseudo-rapidity \(\eta\).

A set of runs allowing a (z,\(\eta\)) scan of the module 0 were analysed. In each run a beam of muons/pions with width equal to \(\sim 25\)mm\(\times 25\)mm in the yz plane and with almost no dispersion impinge in the front face of the module in a given direction \(\eta\)=constant and \(\phi=0^{\theta}\). Several runs for different \(\eta\) values were analysed which allowed a continuous scan in z and a discreet scan in \(\eta\). In the simulation program the particles are generated in the interaction point of the ATLAS detector and hit the module in some point of its inner face with a direction of incidence \(\eta\)=constant and \(\phi=0^{0}\). Several muon and pion beams were simulated for different values of \(\eta\) which allowed a continuous scan in z and \(\eta\), figure 1.

## 2 The Test Beam setup

Following the tests of the 5 prototypes built during 93, 94 and 95, a prototype with the final parameters of the ATLAS detector was built and tested. This last prototype was designed by "module 0". The barrel module 0 was tested in the beam of high energy particles (HEP) in 1996 using a similar scanning table as used for the first five prototype modules. The test beam setup was composed by the five prototype modules placed on either \(\phi\) sides of the module 0: two on one side and three on the other side as it is shown in fig. 2.

Each one of the five prototype modules has a front face of 1m in z and 20cm in \(\phi\) direction, spanning \(\frac{2\pi}{64}\) in the azimuthal angle, see coordinates in fig. 2. They have a radial depth of 80.5 radiation lengths (\(X_{0}\)) or 8.9 nuclear interaction lengths (\(\lambda\)) at \(\eta\)=0. Five towers parallel to the \(\eta\)=0 direction with four radial segmentation at 1.5, 2, 2.5 and 3\(\lambda\) were defined in each prototype module, which provide a tower segmentation of \(\Delta\eta\times\Delta\phi\simeq 0.1\times 0.1\). Each prototype has 18 tiles of different dimensions in the radial depth, each one of 3mm thickness and 100mm depth, which are read out by WLS fibers.

Figure 1: The \(\eta\) scan changes both the z impact point on the front face of the barrel module 0 as well as the angle of incidence (\(\theta\)). a)Test beam conditions, b)MC simulation conditions.

The module 0 has a front face area of 560\(\times\)22\(cm^{2}\) spanning \(\frac{2\pi}{64}\) in the azimuthal angle with a radial depth of 7.6\(\lambda\) at \(\eta\)=0. Three depth segmentations are defined with thickness equal to 1.5\(\lambda\) for the first sampling, 4.2\(\lambda\) for the second and 1.9\(\lambda\) for the third at \(\eta\)=0. Unlike the old prototypes which have a non-projective tower read out, the module 0 has a projective geometry with a granularity in \(\Delta\eta\times\Delta\phi\) equal to 0.1\(\times\)0.1 for the first two samplings and 0.2\(\times\)0.1 for the third sampling, see fig. 3. Within the module 0, like in the old prototypes, the segmentation is achieved by grouping fibers from different tiles in one photomultiplier. Two photomultipliers are required to read out each cell: one to the right side and the other to the left side of the tiles.

The electronics read out are housed in the girder structure in the outside face of the module 0.

In the setup of 1996 tests on beams of HEP there are two muon walls: one in the lateral side of the module 0 and the other in the back side, which allows the measurement of the lateral and longitudinal leakage for each event as well as the assistance in the identification of beam muons.

The position of the beam was measured with 2 beam chambers located in front of the module 0 at distances 3190mm and 5452mm from the inner face of the module. These chambers allow the measurement of the impact point with a precision of \(\sim\)200\(\mu\)m.

## 3 The light yield uniformity

The Tilecal performance and resolution can be degraded by the non-uniformities on the light output. Non-uniformities on the light yield within cells would increase the constant term in the intrinsic resolution for jets. These non-uniformities include non-uniformity inside a tile, tile-to-tile fluctuations, tile-fiber coupling, fiber-to-fiber fluctuations, fluctuations inside a cell due to the fact that more than one tile is read-out by the same fiber and variations of the response across the PMT photocathode.

The light output of a cell depends on many parameters among which the most important are the tile and fiber response. To get the geometry shown in fig. 2, tiles of several sizes and fibers of several lengths were grouped in the same photomultiplier, leading to non-uniformities inside a cell and different light outputs for different cells.

The routing design was chosen to minimize the fluctuations on the light output inside a cell and between cells. Light budget calculations (the product of the tile response by the fibre response) were done to design a fibre routing configuration

Figure 3: The projective geometry of the module 0: only one half of the module is shown â€“ the half instrumented part of the module. The fibers of each cell are routed to one PMT. The PMTs are located in the girder structure with locations represented by the open circles.

satisfying the following conditions [5]:

* Minimization of the non-uniformities within cells (fluctuations of the order of 5% were used as a guiding number);
* Maximization of the light output in order to keep photostatistics at the same level of prototype values (\(\sim\)60 phe/GeV for the 1995 prototype);
* Minimization of the fiber length for optimum light output, to minimize the volume of fiber inside the girder region and also to minimize the cost;
* Small non-uniformities between cells to allows different PMTs to have similar gains;
* Small number of different fiber lengths to allows an efficient fiber insertion procedure.

The uniformity of the barrel module 0 light yield was studied using three sources of information:

* The light yield produced by the cesium source during the calibration;
* The light yield produced in the cells by 180GeV muons impinging the barrel module 0 at \(\theta=90^{\circ}\);
* The light yield calculated using the tiles and the fibers parameterization found in Ref [5].

The Cesium data was taken, passing a \({}^{137}Cs\) source through the holes of the tiles during the calibration of the barrel module 0 with the hydraulic drive [6]. In the following analysis the integral of the calibration curves divided by the width of the cell was used as a measure of the light output [7].

The light output produced in each tile in each cell by muons was obtained from the analysis of a scan with 180GeV muons hitting the module at 90\({}^{\circ}\). To estimate the energy loss by muons in each cell for each tile size, a fit with a Moyal function [8] was done to the total energy deposited in the cell and the MOst Probable value (MOP) was taken from the fit, figure 4. The signal produced by muons in each cell was normalized to the size of the cell (18mm \(\times\) number of tiles in the cell).

The data of the test beam was compared with the calculated light budget found in ref. [5]. The light output produced by the tiles is, in a rough approximation, inversely proportional to the tile area (\(A_{t}\)), and directly proportional to the fiber tile coupling length (L), and is parameterized by the equation:

\[I_{t}=\,a+\,b\times\,\frac{L}{A_{t}} \tag{1}\]In the light budget calculations the following parameters a=-25.4 and b=3574, found from the fit to the experimental data, were used [5].

The light output produced by the fibers when they are excited at different distances from the PMT can be parameterized by a sum of two exponentials with reflection in the aluminized end, and is given by the following equation:

\[I=I_{o,\epsilon}e^{\frac{-x}{L_{b}\,b\,b\,b^{\prime}}}+I_{o,\epsilon}e^{\frac{ -x}{L_{long}}}+R\{I_{o,\epsilon}e^{\frac{-|2L-x|}{L_{b}\,b\,b\,b^{\prime}}}+I_{ o,\epsilon}e^{\frac{-|2L-x|}{L_{long}}}\} \tag{2}\]

The parameters \(I_{o,\epsilon}\), \(I_{o,l}\), \(L_{short}\) and \(L_{long}\), obtained from the fit to the data, are dependent of the fiber length [5].

In figure 5 the calculated light budget is compared with the light output produced by the \({}^{137}Cs\) source. The points are normalized to the value of the smaller tile in each cell (tile #1 in the first sampling, tile #4 in the second sampling and tile #10 in the third sampling). With the exception of the first tower, in sampling 3 there is no information from the Cesium source.

General agreement is obtained, the only disagreement between the Cesium data and the calculated light budget is for tile with size #8.

The light output produced by the two sources of information (muons and \({}^{137}Cs\) source) is shown in figure 6. Non-uniformities in each cell with a rms value

of the order of \(\pm 8\%\) are measured. The \({}^{137}Cs\) data are in good agreement with the muon data. A study of the correlation between the Cesium and the muon data shows a correlation with arms value of the order of 7%.

## 4 The photoelectron statistics

The number of photoelectrons for the module 0 was calculated using the data available from a detailed scan with 180GeV muons at \(\theta=90^{o}\), done in the test beam of September 96.

The formula used to determine the number of photoelectrons per GeV of deposited energy per calorimeter cell, can be found in Ref [9]:

\[N_{pe}=C\left(\frac{Q_{c}}{\sigma_{c}}\right)^{2}\frac{1}{Q_{c}}\alpha_{e} \tag{3}\]

where \(Q_{c}\) (in pC) is the total deposited charge per cell (sum of the signals of

Figure 6: Light yield for 4 towers of the barrel module 0, measured by the \({}^{137}Cs\) source and 180GeV muon beams.

the left and right PMTs\(]\), \(\sigma_{e}\) is the rms value of the difference of the signals of the two PMTs arising from photostatistics and \(\alpha_{e}\) is the conversion factor of the muon response (in pC) to energy (in GeV). The parameter C is a factor to correct the statistical fluctuations in the dynodes of the PMTs, which was assumed in a conservative way to be 1.

\(Q_{e}\) was obtained from the MOP of a Moyal fit in the data, figure 4.

The calculation of \(\sigma_{e}\) was done using the following relation:

\[\sigma_{T}^{2}=\sigma_{e}^{2}+\sigma_{p}^{2} \tag{4}\]

where \(\sigma_{T}\) is the rms value of the difference of the signals in the two PMTs reading out the same cell and was calculated using a Gaussian fit to the data, and \(\sigma_{p}\) is the \(\sigma\) of a Gaussian fit to the difference of the pedestals in the two PMTs, figure 7.

Preliminary results for the number of photoelectrons per GeV per cell obtained for the 11 tile sizes are shown in figure 8. A mean number of \(\sim\)27 photoelectrons per GeV of energy deposited in each cell was obtained for the module 0 when the Moyal fit is used to determine \(Q_{e}\). This value is less than 50% of the value obtained for the prototype constructed in 1995 (\(\sim\)65 photoelectrons per GeV [9]). Although the same method was used to calculate the number of photoelectrons in

the old prototypes, because this method is strongly sensitive to the differences in the calibration of the PMTs reading out the same cell and the \(\sigma\) of the pedestals for the module 0 is about twice the \(\sigma\) of the pedestals for the old prototype modules. The comparison between the old prototypes and the barrel module 0 should be done carefully.

With the first five prototype modules, it was shown that the consequences of a small number of photoelectrons per GeV of deposited energy is a small broadening of the muon energy loss spectrum visible mainly in the first compartment in depth. Nevertheless, in the long term, the calorimeter will profit from the largest possible number of photoelectrons because the ageing process and the radiation damage effects will produce a slight reduction of the light yield along the time.

Several factors can contribute to the large reduction of \(N_{phe}/\)GeV: differences in the geometry (larger tiles, longer fibers, different cell sizes), differences in the fiber routings (the curvature of the fibers near the PMTs can degrade the attenuation length), differences in the read out system, namely in the quantum

efficiency of the photomultipliers1. Table 1 summarizes the several factors that can contribute to the reduction of the light output.

Footnote 1: The quantum efficiency of the photomultipliers used to instrument the old prototype modules (Philips XP2012) is \(\sim\) 18% in the green region (480nm) while the quantum efficiency of the photomultipliers used to instrument the barrel module zero (Hamamatsu R5900) is \(\sim\) 16% in the same region.

Some of the factors responsible for the light reduction, e.g., the tile and the fiber light output and the PMT quantum efficiency can be improved at least to the levels of 1995. The fiber bending radii were already chosen to give the smallest possible mechanical stress to the fibers and to reduce the possibility of mechanical damage.

The \(\eta\) response to 100GeV pions

To study the uniformity of the response of the module 0 to pions a \(\eta\) scan with 100GeV pions was done. The \(\eta\) scan changes both the z impact point on the front of the module 0, as well as the angle of incidence (\(\theta\)), figure 1.

Figure 9 shows the scintillator sampling fraction (\(f_{\pi}\)) for 100GeV pions as a function of \(\eta\). For large \(\eta\) values the sampling fraction is almost constant and equal to \(f_{\pi,mean}=0.027\), but for \(\eta\) values near zero there is a modulation in the sampling fraction with an amplitude that is \(\sim\)11% \(f_{\pi,mean}\)

Figure 10 shows the energy lost by 100GeV pions in the module 0 as a function of the impact point z and \(\eta\). The drop off on the signal at low and high \(\eta\) values is due to the lateral and longitudinal leakage of the shower, respectively. At low

values, the shower enter in the non-instrumented part of the module and at high values the shower is not longitudinally and laterally contained.

A modulation on the signal due to the periodic structure of the module 0 is seen. The amplitude of the modulation for \(\eta\sim 0\) is \(\sim 9\%\)\(E_{mean}\) (test beam data).

The simulated response of the module 0 to pions is superimposed to the test beam data. There is a good agreement between the test beam data and the

Figure 10: Loss energy by 100 GeV pions in the module 0 (Test beam data and Monte Carlo simulation). (a)\(\eta\) values close to 0, (b)Whole \(\eta\) range of the barrel module 0

simulated data as can be seen. The small differences can be explained by the factors mentioned before:

* In the simulation code the fibre-to-fibre, tile-to-tile fluctuations and the photostatistic effects, for instance, were not introduced.
* The half periods of the actual module are not exactly 9mm width due to the master and spacer plates tolerances.
* There is a small difference between the test beam and the simulation conditions like it is schematized in figure 1.

The effects of the structural periodicity on the \(\eta\) response of the module 0 to pions, seen in the standalone test beam configuration of the Tile Calorimeter is expected to be strongly suppressed in the ATLAS configuration. With the electromagnetic compartment in front of the Tilecal, the pion shower will start in the electromagnetic calorimeter and the response of the Tile Calorimeter will be less sensitive to the variations in the sampling fraction.

## 6 The response to muons

### The spectrum of the muons energy loss

The spectrum of the energy loss by 180GeV muons impinging the module 0 at \(\eta\)=0.35 (\(\theta\simeq 20^{o}\)), in the first sampling and in the whole module, is shown in figure 11. The spectrum approximately follows a Landau distribution with high energy tails due to the energy lost by radiative processes (bremsstrahlung and electron-positron pair production) and energetic \(\delta\) rays.

The width of the pedestal is superimposed in the plot. The \(\sigma\) of the pedestals obtained from a Gaussian fit to the data is, in average, \(\sim\)40MeV per PMT. The total signal was collected by 10 PMTs: 4 PMTs in the first sampling (two cells), 4 PMTs in the second sampling and 2 PMTs in the third sampling (one cell). The width of the pedestals (electronic noise) shown in fig. 11b) was calculated by a quadratic sum of the noise widths over the 5 cells.

As can be seen from figure 11, the pedestals are practically superimposed with the muons signal per cell. Although this large noise, the muon signal is distinguishable from the noise.

The data obtained from MC simulation is superimposed, with and without experimental fluctuations included. In the experimental fluctuations only the electronic noise and the photostatistic average effects are included. The electronic noise was included smearing the simulated data with a Gaussian distribution with a \(\sigma\) value that was obtained from the \(\sigma\) of the pedestals in the test beam data. A value equal to 60MeV per cell (two photomultipliers) was used. The photostatistic effects were included doing a smearing in the simulated data with a Poisson distribution. A mean number of 27 photoelectrons per GeV of total energy deposited in each cell was taken.

Figure 11: Energy loss by 180GeV muons impinging the module 0 at \(\theta\simeq 20^{o}\), a)In the first longitudinal sampling of the module 0, b)In the whole module. The simulated data is presented with and without experimental effects included.

We can see a small broadening in the muon signal when experimental fluctuations are included in the simulated data, mainly in the first sampling.

### Results from a \(\eta\) scan with 180GeV muons

The Tilecal module 0 has a periodic structure in the z direction and, as a consequence, the amount of passive and active materials that the particles have to cross depends on the direction of incidence \(\theta\), at least for very small \(\eta\) values.

Figure 12 shows the scintillator sampling fraction for muons (\(f_{\mu}\)) as a function of \(\eta\). The observed modulation for small \(\eta\) values reflects the structure of the calorimeter mentioned before: the periodicity of the modulation on \(f_{\mu}\) is \(\sim\)9mm for \(\eta\simeq 0\) which is equal to half period of the calorimeter. For \(\eta\) values larger than

Figure 12: Scintillator sampling fraction as a function of \(\eta\) for 180GeV muons. Top plot: Small \(\eta\) values. Bottom plot: Entire \(\eta\) range of the module.

\(\sim\)0.1 the sampling fraction is almost constant, \(f_{\mu mean}\sim\)2.7%. A large variation on the sampling fraction is seen for \(\eta\)=0: the maximum and the minimum on \(f_{\mu}\) for \(\eta=0\) is, respectively, \(\sim 2.4\,f_{\mu mean}\) and \(\sim 0.4\,f_{\mu mean}\). For \(\eta\) values larger than \(\sim\)0.7 there is a small increase on \(f_{\mu}\) due to the geometry of the module 0. In the back side of the module 0 there are small spacers with \(\sim\)7mm of length running the whole module in z direction which decrease the value of \(f_{\mu}\) for \(\eta<0.6\). At \(\eta\)=0.7 begins the region where the incident muons do not cross at least the totality of the small spacers in the back side.

Figure 13: Energy deposited by 180 GeV muons in the module 0 (Test beam data). Top plot: \(\eta\) values close to 0. Bottom plot: Whole \(\eta\) range of the barrel module 0.

The \(\eta\) response of the barrel module 0 to 180GeV muons is shown in fig. 13, for \(\eta\) values close to zero and for the whole \(\eta\) range of the module. For polar angles (\(\theta\)) close to zero there is a modulation on the signal which is a consequence of the structural periodicity of the module and the correspondent oscillation in the scintillator sampling fraction. Muons that cross the module traversing almost only iron produce small signals while muons that cross mainly scintillator produce large signals. This is very clear for \(\eta\) near zero, where the amplitude of the modulation represents about 60% of the average energy loss. The modulation has a period of \(\sim\)9mm for \(\eta\)=0, which is one half period in the barrel module 0. For \(\eta=0.07\) the period is \(\sim\)20mm as was expected from the mechanical internal structure of the calorimeter, as it is illustrated in figure 14.

The modulation on the signal disappears for \(\eta>0.1\) as consequence of the decrease in the oscillations of the scintillator sampling fraction.

Another effect is shown in figure 13: the increase of the mean energy loss reflecting the dependence with \(\eta\) of the amount of material crossed by the particles. The radial depth of the module 0 is about 9\(\lambda\) at \(\eta\)=0 and \(\sim 11\lambda\) at \(\eta\)=0.7. The

Figure 14: The increase of the periodicity of the module 0 structure with \(\eta\). In the figure two different \(\eta\) values are shown with \(\eta_{2}>\eta_{1}\).

decrease on the signal on the ATLAS environment will be suppressed by the existence of the extended barrel hadron part covering the region \(0.8<|\eta|<1.7\)[6].

Fig. 15 shows the data obtained with MC simulations: the modulation on the muon signal detected in the test beam (figure 13) is very well reproduced in the simulated response. The modulation is more pronounced in the simulated results than in the test beam data. This is explained by the fact that the effects of the fluctuations on the light output produced in the tiles and in fibers are not included in the simulation program, as well as other instrumental effects such as electronic noise and photostatistics.

Figure 15: Energy loss by 180GeV muons in the module 0 (MC simulation). Top plot: \(\eta\) values close to 0. Bottom plot: Whole \(\eta\) range of the barrel module 0.

The simulated data was fitted with a linear function in regions \(0.15<\eta<0.60\) and \(0.75<\eta<1.00\) and the result is plotted in figure 15 with a full line. The fit was superimposed to the test beam data (figure 13) and a good agreement between the MC simulations and the test beam data can be seen.

## 7 Conclusions

This work is a study of the barrel module 0 uniformity, tested in the beam on September 1996, mainly in order to quantify the contribution that the hadronic calorimeter can give to the detection of muons. Several aspects were analysed and the main results obtained in the present work are summarized in the following lines:

* The analysis of the light yield produced by 180GeV muons impinging the barrel module 0 at \(\theta=90^{\circ}\) and produced by the \(Cs^{137}\) source passing through the tiles, shows non-uniformities within cells with a rms of the order of 8%, which is close to the design requirement of 5% (excepting the tile #8 that is systematically above). The \({}^{137}Cs\) data is in good agreement with the muon data with a correlation presenting a rms value of the order of 7%.
* The calculated number of photoelectrons per GeV of deposited energy per calorimeter cell for the barrel module 0 was \(N_{phe}\simeq\)27 which represents less than 50% of the value obtained for the prototype constructed in 1995. Some of the factors responsible for the reduction of light, e.g, the tile and the fiber light output and the PMT quantum efficiency can be improved at least to the levels of 1995. Although at short term 27 photoelectrons per GeV is sufficient to detect muons, in the long term, the calorimeter will profit from the largest possible number of photoelectrons because the ageing process and the radiation damage effects will produce a slight reduction of the light yield during the operational lifespan of the detector.
* The Tilecal has a periodic mechanical structure which is reflected in the variation with \(\eta\) of the scintillator sampling fraction for muons and pions. Due to this variation the response of the module 0 to muons as a function of \(\eta\) presents a modulation with an amplitude that decreases with the increase of \(\eta\) and basically disappears for \(\eta>\)0.1. The results of a \(\eta\) scan with 180GeV muons shows a maximum amplitude on the modulation of the signal for \(\eta\simeq\)0 of \(\sim\) 60% of the mean energy lost by muons in the module. The signal produced by 100GeV pions in the module 0 as a function of \(\eta\) shows a similar modulation but with a much smaller amplitude because the dimensions of the showers produced by pions in the module makes them less sensitive to the local structure of the module. It is expected that the modulation on the signal produced by pions in the module 0, without the e.m. calorimeter in front of the Tilecal, will be strongly suppressed with the electromagnetic compartment in front.
