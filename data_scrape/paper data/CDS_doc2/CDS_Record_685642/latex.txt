## Abstract.

The estimations of the residual current in the interelectrod gap of the \(LAr\) e.m. and hadron \(ATLAS\) calorimeters at \(LHC\) luminosity are presented. It is appeared that the mean value of this current is proportional mean deposited energy in a cell and ratio electron drift time to a time between bunch crossing.

## 1 Introduction.

Future high-energy hadron colliders operating at high luminosity like \(LHC\) and \(SSC\) will set strong requirements for e.m. and hadronic calorimetry. It is known that the liquid argon(\(LAr\)) technique is a good candidate to be used in the future experiments. However, when operated as an ionization chamber in which electrons from ionization is collected, such a detector is relatively slow, its response being driven by electron drift time between the electros which is typically 200 ns for 1 mm gap. The information about the energy deposited in argon can be obtained in shorter time then electron drift time by observing a fraction of the induced charge. The charge collection time limits the counting rate only indirectly through the signal-to-noise ratio. However, for very high luminosity and short time interval between bunch crossings the overlapping effect is possible for currents induced by successive bunch crossings. Such an effect is able to cause some problems for a preamplifier(PAM) performance. In this case it is important to know the value of the residual current induced by drifting electrons from the previous bunch crossings. In this papper we present estimations of it for end-cap _ATLAS_ e.m. and hadron calorimeters [1].

## 2 Geometry and calculation procedures.

To study the residual current we used 2000 minimum biased events simulated by program _PYTHIA_-5.6 [2]. For LHC luminosity \(L=2.5*10^{34}cm^{-2}s^{-1}\) the mean number of events in one bunch crossing should be about 38. The real number of events in each bunch crossing was generated according to a Poisson distribution with this mean value. The resulting secondary particles were followed through the detectors. For the charge particles we took existing magnetic field (B=2T) into account in the volume of inner detectors.

The geometry used for calculation is a simple approximation of the actual design for _ATLAS_ as shown in Fig. 1(top). The structure of the absorber elements (\(ABE\)) for e.m. and hadron calorimeters is presented in the same Fig. (bottom). For simplisity we considered that all ABEs were perpendicular to the beam axis. The readout cells have a lateral granularity of \(\Delta\eta\chi\Delta\varphi\)=0.05x0.05 for hadron and \(\Delta\eta\chi\Delta\varphi\)=0.02x0.02 for e.m. calorimeters. In front of the first elements of e.m. calorimeter we took the material of the cryostat wall (\(1.5X_{0}\)) into account.

Particle showers in calorimeters are typically simulated by tracking all secondary particles of the shower down to some minimum energy as in \(GEANT\). The computer time needed for simulations of this type increases lineary with the shower energy and can easily become prohibitive. We did not generate full e.m. and hadron showers but used averaged description of showers according to the simple parametrization [3]. The mean longitudinal profiles of e.m. and hadron showers can be described by some Gamma distributions. The lateral profile of a shower can be described by

\[f(r)=2rR^{2}/(r^{2}+R^{2})^{2}\]where all distances are measured in units of the absorbtion length (\(\lambda\)) for hadron shower and units of Molier radius (\(R_{M}\)) for e.m. one. The parameters used for calculation are the same as in Ref. [3]. The shower origin is fluctuated according to an exponentional distribution. To estimate energy deposited in a cell we integrated the longitudinal and lateral profiles into the cell volume for all nearest showers (\(\pm 2.5R_{M}\) or \(\pm 2.5\lambda\)). Only small fraction of energy (9.7% for e.m. and 1.3% for hadron calorimeters) is released in the sensetive medium. To estimate the number of created electron-ion pairs we devided this energy by the value 46 eV, which is necessary to produce one pair in liquid argon. The current induced by drifting electrons has a triangular form [4]. The duration of the current is equal to the electron drift time (\(\tau_{d}\)). In our case the duration is equal to 300 ns for hadron and 150 ns for e.m. calorimeters. As the time between bunch crossings (\(t_{b}\)) is equal to 25 ns for \(LHC\) we have to take 11 and 5 previous bunch crossings into account to calculate residual current in a cell.

## 3 Results.

The first step for estimating of the overlapping effect is the calculation the mean number of particles hitting in one cell per bunch crossing. This value is equal to about 0.02 for e.m. and 0.1 for hadron calorimeters in the range of \(\eta\) from 1.5 to 3.0. It seems that overlapping effect in this case should be very small. However we did not take into account the lateral size of the shower with respect to the cell and electron drift time with respect to the time between bunch crossing. The first factor is about 25 for both e.m. and hadron calorimeters. The second one is equal to 5 and 11 accordingly. In this conditions practically in any selected cell should be residual current. If we know mean bunch crossing current induced in a cell (\(<I_{b}>\) ) and the ratio \(N=\tau_{d}/t_{b}\) we can estimate mean residual current (\(<I_{r}>\) meaning after \(t>\tau_{d}\)) as \(<I_{r}>=<I_{b}>*(N-1)/2\).

The second step to estimate the residual current is the calculation of contributions in a cell from all nearest showers. Such calculation were done and the results for \(\eta=2.8\) are presented in Fig.2 and Fig.3. The dependence of the residual current for some e.m. and hadron calorimeters cells from the number of bunch crossing are shown to the right of these Figs. The value of the residual current has big variations from the bunch crossing time. The dependence of the mean residual current from number of cell in the tower is presented to the left. For comparison in the same Fig. we show the dependence of the mean bunch crossing current from number of cell. It is saw that this value in some times smaller then for the residual current. In Fig. 2 we also for comparison present the same dependence of the residual current for double gap thickness. It is clearly that value of residual current should be proportional to the gap thickness. For information in the same Fig. it is shown the contribution in the residual current only from hadrons. It is obviously that their contribution is important only for last cells of the e.m. calorimeter.

The same results were obtained for \(\eta=2.4\) and \(\eta=2.0\). It is appeared that the mean residual current for \(\eta=2.0\) in two times smaller then for \(\eta=2.8\).

In conclusion we should be say some words about ion current. It is known that electrons in liquid argon are in some thousand times more mobile then ions. So the current induced by the ions from one bunch crossing should be very small. However the rezulting mean residual ion current will be the same as the electron one only with very small variations in time.

## 4 Conclusions.

The high \(LHC\) luminosity and repetition rate to the time overlapping of signals, induced in each separate tower of the \(LAr\) end-cap \(ATLAS\) calorimeter by minimum biased events, which results in the incessant residual current across gaps. The mean value of the residual current is proportional to gap width and depends on longitudinal gap position.

This effect is more pronounced for the hadron calorimeter due to the larger size of the hadron shower.

The consequences of this effect has to be carefully considered for each particular \(LAr\) end-cap calorimeter design, since it could increase the noise from from minimum biased events and influence the \(PAM^{\prime}s\) performance.

For control of the influence overlapping effect on the quality of the operation \(LAr\) calorimeter it is possible to test the prototype in more wide and more intensity beams.
