**Abstract: Strong scattering of gauge boson pairs at the LHC will be a challenging measurement in nonresonant scenarios. We discuss the possibilities of making such measurements in the \(W_{L}^{+}W_{L}^{+}\) and WZ production processes.**While the SM is renormalizable and consistent with all precision electroweak measurements, it has well known shortcomings [1]: Alternative theories, which could provide a mechanism for electroweak symmetry breaking, fermion mass generation, and regularisation of gauge boson scattering cross section therefore need to be examined.

Electroweak symmetry could be broken in models of weak coupling of gauge bosons, as in supersymmetry, or in strong coupling models, at high energies, such as technicolor. Variants of the latter models predict resonances, such as the techniho \((\rho_{T})\), which could be discovered at the LHC up to high masses [2, 4]. In this note, we examine a strong coupling scenario where no such resonance exists.

All the signals and backgrounds discussed in this note have been generated with PYTHIA 6.1 [5]. The trigger acceptance as well as the detector acceptance and resolution effects were simulated with the parametrized Monte Carlo program ATLFAST 2.0 [6], with default values of the parameters. In particular, because of the low cross sections involved, high luminosity conditions (\({\cal L}=10^{34}\) cm\({}^{-2}\) s\({}^{-1}\)) are assumed. Leptons were required to be isolated, meaning that their electromagnetic cluster in the calorimeter were separated from other clusters by \(\Delta R>0.4\) and \(E_{T}<10\) GeV in a cone \(\Delta R=0.2\) around the lepton.

## 1 Non-resonant \(W_{l}z_{l}\)-scattering.

The process of \(W_{L}\,Z_{L}\) resonance production has previously been considered in ATLAS in the framework of the Chiral Lagrangian model (ChL) [2] and in a technicolor model [4]. Here, we investigate the possibility to study non-resonant scattering in the ChL model.

### The Chiral Lagrangian Model

In the Chiral Lagrangian model [3], the form of the Lagrangian is only constrained by symmetry considerations which are common to any strong electroweak symmetry breaking sector. Differences among underlying theories appear through the values of the parameters of the Chiral Lagrangian. Within the chiral approach the low-energy Lagrangian is built as an expansion in derivatives of the Goldstone bosons fields. There is only one possible term with two derivatives which respects \(SU(2)_{L+R}\) symmetry pattern:

\[{\cal L}^{(\,2)}=\frac{v^{\,2}}{4}trD_{\mu}UD^{\mu}U^{\dagger} \tag{1}\]

where \(D_{\mu}U=d_{\mu}U\) - \(W_{\mu}U+U\,B_{\mu}\), \(W_{\mu}=-ig\sigma^{a}W_{\mu}^{a}/2\), \(B_{\mu}=ig\sigma^{3}B_{\mu}/2\).

The dependence on the different models appears at next order through two phenomenological parameters \(L_{1}\) and \(L_{2}\):

\[{\cal L}^{(4)}=L_{1}(tr\,D_{\mu}UD^{\mu}U^{\dagger})^{2}+L_{2}(tr\,D_{\mu}UD^{ \nu}U^{\dagger})^{2} \tag{2}\]

The \(SU(2)_{L\,+R}\) symmetry allows us to define a weak isospin I. The \(W_{L}W_{L}\) scattering can then be written in terms of isospin amplitudes, exactly as in low energy hadron physics. We assign isospin indices as follows,

\[W_{L}^{a}W_{L}^{b}\to W_{L}^{c}W_{L}^{d} \tag{3}\]

where \(W_{L}\) denotes either \(W_{L}^{\pm}\) or \(Z_{L}\), where \(W_{L}^{\pm}=(1/\sqrt{2})\)\((W_{L}^{1}\mp iW_{L}^{2})\) and \(Z_{L}=W_{L}^{3}\). The scattering amplitude is given by

\[{\cal M}(W_{L}^{a}W_{L}^{b}\to W_{L}^{c}W_{L}^{d})\equiv A(s,t,u)\delta^{ab} \delta^{cd}+A(t,s,u)\delta^{ac}\delta^{bd}+A(u,t,s)\delta^{ad}\delta^{bc} \tag{4}\]

where \(a,b,c,d=\)1,2,3 and \(s,t,u\) are the usual Mandelstam kinematical variables.

In this approach it is possible to compute the function \(A(s,t,u)\) in \({\cal O}(p^{4})\) order[7]

\[A(s,t,u)=\frac{s}{v^{\,2}}+\frac{1}{4\pi v^{\,4}}(2L_{1}s^{2}+L_{2}(t^{\,2}+u ^{2}))\]

\[+\frac{1}{16\pi^{\,2}v^{\,4}}\left(-\frac{t}{6}(s+2t)\log(-\frac{t}{\mu^{\,2}} )-\frac{u}{6}(s+2u)\log(-\frac{u}{\mu^{\,2}})-\frac{s^{2}}{2}\log(-\frac{s}{ \mu^{\,2}})\right) \tag{5}\]

The values of \(L_{1}\) and \(L_{2}\) depend on the model, but are expected to be in the range 10\({}^{-2}\) to 10\({}^{-3}\).

The usual Chiral Lagrangian approach does not respect unitarity. The violation could be very large at high energies. In this analysis the Inverse Amplitude Method will be used[8, 9] to unitarize these chiral amplitudes.

The most interesting feature of this approach is that it allows us to describe different reactions by using only two parameters \(L_{1}\) and \(L_{2}\). It is possible to reproduce the broad Higgs-like resonance in (I,J) = (0,0) channel and resonant and nonresonant scattering in the channel (1,1) by selecting of the values of \(L_{1}\) and \(L_{2}\). The scattering in the channel (1,1) depends only on the combination \(L_{2}\) -2 \(L_{1}\).

### Signals and Backgrounds

The signal and backgrounds were simulated by using ATLFAST with PYTHIA as an event generator. The process of scattering of longitudinal bosons in the present model, with any given values of \(L_{1}\) and \(L_{2}\) was incorporated into PYTHIA. The effective vector boson approximation was used for the generation. The validity of such an approximation has been discussed in[10].

To estimate the observability of the signal, the process of nonresonant \(W_{L}^{\pm}Z_{L}\to W_{L}^{\pm}Z_{L}\) scattering with the decay Z\(\to ll\), and W\(\to l\nu\) (l=e,\(\mu\)) was generated for two values of \(L_{1}\): 0.003 and 0.01. The parameter \(L_{2}\) was set equal to 0.

The main features of the signal are

* The presence of two high-\(p_{t}\) leptons of same flavour and opposite charge in the barrel region, having an invariant mass consistent with the mass of Z-boson.
* One additional high-\(p_{t}\) lepton in the barrel region
* Significant missing momentum in the event due to the presence of a neutrino.
* The presence of energetic jets in the forward region, since the it is a vector boson fusion process.

There are two kinds backgrounds for this process - irreducible (continuum WZ pair production) and reducible QCD background.

The main QCD background is the process of Z\(t\bar{t}\) production where one of the W bosons from t-quark decays into lepton and antineutino. The value of \(\sigma\times BR(Z\to ll)\) of this process for \(\sqrt{\hat{s}}>500\) GeV is equal to 26.3 fb.

The irreducible background of WZ production was generated by PYTHIA with cuts \(\sqrt{\hat{s}}>500\) GeV and \(P_{t,hard}>100\) GeV. In order to be insensitive to the Higgs boson, its mass was set to 100 GeV. The value of \(\sigma\times BR\) for this process was 13.5 fb.

Background from \(ZZ\) production has a lower cross section: \(\sigma\times BR=1.52\) fb, with cuts \(\sqrt{\hat{s}}>500\) GeV and \(P_{t,hard}>100\) GeV.

The process of non-resonant \(W_{L}^{\pm}Z_{L}\to W_{L}^{\pm}Z_{L}\) scattering was simulated for 2 different values of \(L_{1}\) : 0.003 and 0.01. For \(L_{1}\)=0.003 \(\sigma\times BR\) is equal 0.19 fb and for \(L_{1}\)=0.01 \(\sigma\times BR\) 0.11 fb for \(\sqrt{\hat{s}}>500\) GeV.

### Analysis

It is well known that the vector bosons in the processes \(V_{L}V_{L}\to V_{L}V_{L}\) scattering are produced mostly in the central region and are characterized by large values of transverse momenta. This characteristic is used to suppress the background by selecting high \(p_{t}\) decay products. The events were required to have 2 isolated and identified leptons of same flavour (ee or \(\mu\mu\)) and opposite charge in the barrel region (\(|\eta|<2\)) with \(p_{t}>30\) GeV. The invariant mass of these two leptons was required to lie in the region \(|M_{ll}-M_{Z}|<6\) GeV. One additional lepton with the same kinematical cuts was required as a candidate for the W decay. The overall efficiencies of these selection criteria were \(\simeq 52\%\) for \(W_{L}^{\pm}Z_{L}\) scattering, 18% for WZ background and 11% for \(\mathrm{Z}t\overline{t}\) production.

The event was selected if at least one jet with \(p_{t}>40\) GeV and energy larger than 500 GeV was present in the interval of pseudorapidity \(2<|\eta|<5\). The efficiency of the forward jet tagging procedure was 0.64 for the signal process, 0.17 for WZ production and 0.26 for \(\mathrm{Z}t\overline{t}\) background. The high value for the efficiency for \(\mathrm{Z}t\overline{t}\) is due to jets produced by b-quarks from t-quark decay.

A missing moment of at least 75 GeV was required. The efficiency of this cut for the signal was 0.75 for the signal, and 0.65 and 0.25 for the ZW and \(\mathrm{Z}t\overline{t}\) backgrounds.

The processes of scattering of longitudinal bosons are analyzed in the region of large invariant mass, where they become important. As a measure of the invariant mass the cluster transverse mass \(M_{T}\) of WZ system[11, 12] was used:

\[M_{T}^{2}=\left[\sqrt{M^{2}(lll)+p_{T}^{2}(lll)}+\ \left|\not{p}_{T}\right| \right]^{2}\]

\[-\left[\vec{p}_{T}(lll)+\not{p}_{T}\right]^{2}.\]

where \(M(lll)\) and \(p_{T}(lll)\) are the invariant mass and transverse momentum of the three charged leptons and \(\not{p}_{T}\) is the missing momentum in the event. To increase the signal/background ratio the cluster transverse mass of WZ is required to be at least 600 GeV.

The transverse mass \(M_{T}\) distribution for the \(W_{L}^{\pm}Z_{L}\) scattering and for \(\mathrm{Z}t\overline{t}\) background, after the application of cuts, is presented in figure 1. The number of signal and background events with the invariant mass of WZ system bigger then 600 GeV for an integrated luminosity of \(\mathcal{L}=5\cdot 10^{5}\) pb\({}^{-1}\) and applying different cuts, are presented in table 1. The \(ZZ\) background is not shown since it is effectively cut by the requirement of missing transverse momentum. The ratio of the number of events observed after all cuts for the process \(W_{L}^{\pm}Z_{L}\to W_{L}^{\pm}Z_{L}\) divided by square root from the number of the background events is used as a measure of the sensitivity to this process.

## 2 Like sign W-pair production

The process of \(W_{L}^{+}W_{L}^{+}\) production has been considered in the literature [12, 13] as a potentially sensitive probe of scattering of vector bosons at high mass because of low background levels. This channel can be particularly important since it has been shown that a complementarity relation between resonant and nonresonant \(W_{L}Z_{L}\) scattering exists [14].

### Signals and backgrounds

Here, the observability of like-sign W-pair production, followed by leptonic decay (\(\mu\) or \(e\)) of the W's is discussed. The analysis expands on a previous study [15] by (i) accounting

The Standard Model diagrams for \(W^{+}W^{+}\) production are shown in fig. 2. The \(WW\) fusion diagrams consist of a quadrilinear coupling, a t-channel \(\gamma/Z\) exchange and a possible heavy Higgs in the t-channel. The irreducible backgrounds, which produce mostly transverse W's, are from continuum WW bremsstrahlung, in lowest order electroweak process of O(\(\alpha^{2}\)) in amplitude, or from gluon-exchange subprocesses of order \(\alpha\alpha_{S}\). At large invariant mass \(M_{WW}\), these backgrounds are of comparable strength. Backgrounds from \(Wt\overline{t}\) and \(WZ\) production are also considered. The "signal" is generated with PYTHIA 6.2, in the effective W approximation, but taking into account transverse momentum of the outgoing quarks. The \(WZ\) backgrounds have also been generated with PYTHIA. They include the process (ISUB=23) of quark fusion (\(f_{i}\overline{f}_{j}\to ZW\)) and the process (ISUB=73) of longitudinal vector boson fusion (\(ZW\to ZW\)). The other backgrounds have been incorporated into PYTHIA, using a generator code obtained from Barger et al. [13], based on helicity amplitude methods. The parton distribution function CTEQ2L is used for these backgrounds, with scale \(M_{W}\) for the electroweak background and \(\sqrt{\hat{s}}/2\) for the gluon-exchange and \(Wt\overline{t}\) backgrounds. The contributions from electroweak processes not involving the Higgs are estimated by assuming a low-mass Higgs (\(m_{H}=100\) GeV).

As reference processes for the high mass \(W_{L}^{+}W_{L}^{+}\) "signal", we take:

* a t-channel exchange of a Higgs with \(m_{H}=1\) TeV, simulated with PYTHIA. The broad width of the resonance is calculated in NLO approximation. The cross section times branching ratio (\(W_{L}^{+}W_{L}^{+}\) fusion diagrams only) is \(\sigma\times\) BR = 1.33 fb. Removing the effect of the Higgs diagram by putting \(m_{H}=100\) GeV would reduce the cross section to 0.29 fb. Using the full set of diagrams (fig. 2) from the generator code of [13], the cross section calculated would be 27.3 fb in the presence of the 1 TeV mass Higgs, of which 25.9 fb are due to background electroweak processes (putting \(m_{H}=100\) GeV). Rather than take the difference between two set of simulated events with the generator of [13], with \(m_{H}=1\) TeV and \(m_{H}=100\) GeV, we choose to take the PYTHIA events as the "signal" and assign a cross section of 1.33 fb.
* a model with K-matrix unitarised amplitude \(a_{ij}^{K}=\frac{Re(a_{ij})}{1-iRe(a_{ij})}\), where \(a_{ij}\) is the low energy theorem amplitude, proportional to s. This model is constructed to explicitely satisfy elastic unitarity and would yield the maximum expected signal. Here, \(\sigma\times\) BR = 1.12 fb.
* a Chiral Lagrangian model, as described in ATLAS note [2], where the observability of a resonance in the I=1, J=1 channel of \(WZ\) scattering was studied. The same parameters as were used in this note are chosen here: L\({}_{1}=0\), and L\({}_{2}=\)0.006 or 0.01. This choice of parameters yields narrow resonances in the \(WZ\) production channel,Figure 2: Feynman diagrams for \(W^{+}W^{+}\) production by SM electroweak processes. This figure is from ref [13]

and will allow to test the complementarity relation between the nonresonant and resonant channels. Here, \(\sigma\times\) BR = 0.484 and 0.379 fb, respectively.

The cross sections for signal and background processes considered here are shown in table 2. Note that only \(W_{L}^{+}W_{L}^{+}\) is considered, but not \(W_{L}^{-}W_{L}^{-}\).

### Analysis

Analysis was performed using simulation of the detector with ATLFAST 2.0 and ATLFAST-B, with parameters for high luminosity. The following leptonic cuts were first applied

* two positively charged isolated leptons in the central region (\(p_{T}>40\) GeV and \(|\eta|<1.75\)) must be identified. They will satisfy the trigger requirement.
* the opening angle between the two leptons, in the transverse plane, must satisfy: \(\cos\Delta\phi<-0.5\). This cut selects preferentially events with longitudinal W's which have high \(p_{T}\). The invariant mass of the two leptons is further required to satisfy \(m_{ll}>100\) GeV. This latter cut eliminates few events in the low \(m_{llvv}\) region.

At the jet level, backgrounds can be reduced by requiring that

* No jet having \(p_{T}>50\) GeV be present in the central region(\(|\eta|<2\)). This reduces significantly background from the \(Wt\bar{t}\) process.
* Two jets must be present in the forward and backward regions: \(\eta>2\) and \(\eta<-2\), with energies \(>300\) GeV.
* A lower \(p_{T}\) is required from the forward jets: \(p_{T}<150\) GeV for the first and \(p_{T}<90\) GeV for the second.

### Results

Fig. 3 displays the expected mass distribution of the \(ll\nu\nu\) system, after all cuts are applied, accounting only for transverse momentum. No correction is made for pileup effects in jet tagging or central jet veto.

The number of events expected is shown in table 3, assuming an integrated cross section of 300 fb\({}^{-1}\). If one counts only events with \(m_{ll\nu}>400\) GeV, a significant signal to background ratio is obtained (see table 4). As expected, the K-matrix scenario gives the highest signal, observable after a few years of high luminosity running, whereas only a very low signal if the \(\rho\) resonance is itself clearly observable. The major remaining background, especially at low values of \(m_{ll\nu}\) is from continuum transverse W pairs. Note that only a \(W_{L}^{+}W_{L}^{+}\) signal is searched for in this analysis. Combining the results with \(W_{L}^{-}W_{L}^{-}\) would add approximately one-half to one-third of the signal and backgrounds.

Potentially large systematic uncertainties associated with the estimated cross section of this background, or of the cut efficiencies, can be evaluated, to some extent, by analysing various distributions under different cut conditions. Variations with respect to the nominal cuts L1-L2 and J1-J3, defined as follows, were considered:

* leptonic cut added: \(\Delta p_{T}^{ll}>200\) GeV, where \(\Delta p_{T}^{ll}\) is the norm of the vectorial difference of the \(p_{T}\)'s of the leptons. This cut has been considered in previous publications, such as in [12].
* the acceptance region for leptons is extended to \(|\eta|<2\)
* the energy required for the forward jets was 150 GeV
* the energy required for the forward jets was 600 GeV

As can be seen from table 5, the cut on \(\Delta p_{T}^{ll}>\) is not sensitive to the higher \(m_{ll\nu}\) mass region. Extending the region in pseudorapidity of lepton acceptance increases the background from transverse W's. More stringent forward jet tagging can improve the significance of the signal, as it appears to cut more the transverse W's than the \(W_{L}^{+}W_{L}^{+}\) signal.

## 3 Conclusions

Nonresonant processes \(W_{L}\,Z_{L}\to W_{L}\,Z_{L}\) and \(W_{L}^{+}W_{L}^{+}\) of longitudinal vector boson fusion scattering at high mass have been investigated. Both processes are very challenging, requiring a few years of high luminosity running and a good understanding and control of
