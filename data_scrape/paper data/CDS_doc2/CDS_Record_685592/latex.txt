**Abstract**

This note describes a method for determination the relative alignment and for coordinate scale calibration of the CSCs modules. The basic procedure involves the move of the narrow \(\sim 50\,\mu\)m monochromatic X-ray beam with energy E=36.026 KeV (\(K_{\alpha_{1}}\) Pr\({}^{59}\)) along the axis perpendicular to the cathode strips and use the X-ray beam position reconstructed from the detected signals to determinate the ratio \(X_{measured}/X_{real}\). This technique can be applied for Cathode Strip Chambers of the ATLAS Forward Muon System.

The Cathode Strip Chambers (CSC) are ordinary Multi-wire Proportional Chambers (MWPC) with segmented cathodes in which the track position can be determined by interpolation of the charge induced on the precision cathode strips. The CSCs provide all required functions in muon system such as the triggering, tracking and bunch crossing identification. The spatial resolution better than 75 \(\mu\)m can be achieved [1].

One of advantages of the cathode strip chambers is the possibility to perform complete tests and calibration of these chambers and associated electronics using an X-ray source. For example, using this technique one can make the amplitude calibration of each cathode channel and then make detailed calibration of the coordinate scale by measuring the ratio \(X_{measured}/X_{real}\) along the axis perpendicular to the cathode strips.

A vigorous and successful R&D program has been carried out by the PNPI group in order to demonstrate the possibility to calibrate CSC by the narrow monochromatic X-ray beam with required accuracy and to develop an engineering prototype of the X-ray diagnostic device which can measure all properties of the cathode strip chambers [2, 3].

More recently, similar technique was successfully developed for the high accuracy measurements of the anode wire position inside straw tubes, which are the basic elements of the Transition Radiation Tracker (TRT) for the ATLAS experiment [4, 5, 6, 7].

In this note we outline possible application of this X-ray technique for the calibration of the ATLAS CSCs.

## 2 Choice of the X-ray beam energy

The choice of the X-ray beam energy for CSC calibration was dictated by the following reasons:

* the energy of the X-ray beam should be high enough to readily penetrate through several CSC layers with reasonable attenuation: the CSCs contain some materials that strongly absorb low energy X-ray beam, for example, so called G10 plate with copper strips;
* on the other hand, the energy of the X-ray beam should be not high for the reasonable absorption efficiency of the X-ray in the gas mixture. To increase this efficiency some amount of xenon might be added to the chamber gas mixture during the test;there are several physical phenomena which limit the X-ray spatial resolution attainable in gas proportional chambers. One of them is finite range of the electrons from the initial X-ray interaction in the gas mixture. Therefore, one can not use arbitrary high energies of the X-ray beam directly because of too long ranges of the photoelectrons produced in the chamber gas.
* The X-ray energy should be monochromatic so that The energy of the monochromatic X-ray beam might be choose just above the K-edge energy of the main (from point view of the absorption efficiency) gas component.

The X-ray tube target elements with characteristic line energies just above the xenon K-edge were considered. Taking into account that the xenon K-edge energy equals to \(34.561\) KeV, the most suitable material for the anti-cathode will be Pr\({}^{59}\) with K\({}_{\alpha_{1}}\) characteristic line energy E = \(36.026\) KeV [8]. The atomic photo-effect of the X-ray quant a of this energy in xenon will result in the emission of a short range photo-electrons. Following this reason, the special X-ray tube has been constructed at PNPI with the anti-cathode made of Pr\({}^{59}\) and with the silicon crystal monochromator, selecting K\({}_{\alpha_{1}}\)-line of Pr.

## 3 Estimation of the ionization cluster size

The process of absorption of an X-ray in gas mixture is complex, consisting of cascade of interactions with individual atoms. In our energy range the primary absorption mechanism of an X-ray with a gas atom is atomic photo-effects. The Compton interactions in the gas can be neglected. If the X-ray energy is \(E_{x}\), the interaction of the photon with an electron shell with binding energy \(E_{b}\) results in the emission of a photo-electron of energy \(E_{x}-E_{b}\). The excited gas atom then de-excites and the majority of its energy is dissipated by either emission of Auger electrons, energy \(E_{b}-2E_{(b+1)}\), or emission of a fluorescent X-ray, energy \(E_{b}-E_{(b+1)}\), where \(E_{(b+1)}\) is the binding energy of the next electron shell.

In case of xenon gas mixture and the X-ray beam with the \(K_{\alpha_{1}}Pr^{59}\) energy the scheme with the various possible interactions will follow is shown in Fig.1. The X-ray photons with primary energy equal to \(E_{x}\)=36.026 KeV interact with xenon mainly (83%) through atomic photo-effects on the K-shell. The short range photoelectrons of 1.465 KeV energy are produced. The emission of a xenon \(K_{\alpha}\) fluorescent photons at energy \(\overline{E}_{K_{\alpha}}\) = 29.667 KeV has a probability 87.4%. On the other hand, the probability to detect photon of this energy at the chamber is too small. Therefore the largest part of the energy flows away with xenon fluorescent photons. The remaining energy 4.894 KeV adds up mainly through cascade of the short range Auger electrons with the maximum energy of E\({}_{max}\)3.4 KeV (see Table 1). The total energy absorbed in chamber for this case is equal to 6.359 KeV (\(K_{\alpha}\) escape peak). Another possibility will arise when part of the energy flows away with \(K_{\beta}\) xenon fluorescent photons \(\overline{E}_{K_{\beta}}=33.6\) KeV. In this case total energy absorbed in chamber is equal to 2.426 KeV (\(K_{\beta}\) escape peak).

The position resolution of the chamber for the primary X-ray quanta will be determined by the range of photoelectrons and secondary Auger electrons. In simple model, ionization created by electron is assumed, on average, to be uniformly distributed along a radius \(R_{p}\). The angular distribution of photoelectrons is assumed to be isotropic, so that the centroids of ionization from many events are distributed on a sphere of radius \(r=(0.5\div 0.6)R_{p}\), where \(R_{p}\) is so called practical range. In this case the projection of a spherical surface in one dimension is rectangular distribution with width equals to \(R_{p}\).

The electron practical range in gases at the energy region of several KeV can be estimated by the following formula [9]:

\[R_{p}(mg/cm^{2})=A/Z\cdot 3.872\cdot 10^{-3}\cdot E_{e}^{1.492}\ \ \,\]

\[0.37\ KeV\leq E_{e}\leq 10\ KeV\]

The rms deviation of the above equation from experimental data is \(\stackrel{{<}}{{{}_{\sim}}}\)25%. For electron energy \(E_{e}\geq 10\) KeV one can use the following formula:

\[R_{p}(mg/cm^{2})=6.97\cdot 10^{-3}\cdot E_{e}^{1.6}\ \ \,\]

which has a good agreement with experimental data up to \(E_{e}=\)50 KeV [10]. According to this formula photo-electrons from the xenon K-shell have a range of about 25 \(\mu\)m. To this one should add the the range of highest energy Auger electrons. The rms value of the ionization cluster centre of gravity distribution does not exceed 50 \(\mu\)m. The relative yield of the long range photoelectrons due to absorption in the other component of the working gas mixture (\(Ar,CO_{2},CF_{4}\), etc) depends on the amount of xenon in the gas mixture. For gas mixture contains 25% of xenon only 0.8% of quanta will be absorbed by Ar. The photo-absorption cross section of the X-ray quanta with energy 36.026 KeV for \(CO_{2}\) and \(CF_{4}\) in 5 and respectively in 16 times lower than for argon.

Another source of the long range electrons are photoelectrons from the X-ray absorption in the copper cathodes. This photoelectrons has initial energy \(E_{e}=\)27 KeV and its range in copper is equal to 1.5 \(\mu\)m. The direction of emission is approximately perpendicular to the incoming photon direction. This photoelectrons exits to the chamber gas mixture with continuous energy from 0 up to 27 KeV, from copper surface. The probability exit to the chamber gas for this photo-electrons can be estimated as \(\eta=0.5\cdot 10^{-2}\) 1/photon. Should be noted, that in the spectrum for emitted electrons from copper there is also small component of Auger electrons from copper with the energy \(E_{e}=\)7 KeV.

The fluorescent X-ray from copper with energy \(E=\)8 KeV also emitted from full thickness of copper cathode. The mean free path of this X-ray quanta in gas mixture is \(\sim\) 20 cm and therefore probability to detect this radiation is rather high \(\eta=6.2\cdot 10^{-3}\) 1/photon.

To summarise, the background in the position distribution of the initial X-ray quanta will be caused by the next process:

* KLL and KLM Auger electrons from xenon with mean energies \(\overline{E}_{e}\)=24.5 KeV and \(\overline{E}_{e}\)=28.5 KeV respectively;
* shells binding energies;
* photoelectrons from Ar with energy \(E_{e}\sim\) 32 KeV;
* photo- and Auger electrons from copper cathode with continues energies with \(E_{max}=E_{x}-9\) KeV and \(E_{max}=7\) KeV respectively;
* fluorescent radiation from copper cathode.

The relative yields of all discussed above process and practical range of the maximum energy electrons produced in this process for the gas mixture 37.5%CO\({}_{2}\)+15%CF\({}_{4}\)+22.5%Ar+25%Xe are listed in Table 1.

## 4 X-ray absorption in the cathode material and counting rates

The typical design of the multi cathode strip chamber module [1] is shown in Fig. 2. The chosen energy for X-ray beam, as mentioned above, just above the xenon K-edge, is high enough to penetrate through many chambers layers with reasonable attenuation. Therefore all chamber in module can be tested simultaneously. Fig.5 shows the attenuation of the initial X-ray beam with energy \(E_{x}\)=36.026 KeV as a function of the number copper-clad fibre glass plates. The estimated counting rate for 25% xenon gas mixture and initial X-ray beam intensity 8000 \(sec^{-1}\) are listed below:

\begin{tabular}{c c} \hline \hline layer num. & Count. rate, sec\({}^{-1}\) \\ \hline
1 & 378 \\
2 & 172 \\
3 & 78 \\
4 & 36 \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular} The width of the gap is about 4.6 mm. The xenon absorption efficiency is about 7% for one gap.

## 5 The existing setup for CSCs calibration by X-ray beam

A sketch of the existing setup for CSC calibration is shown in Fig.3. It consists of two main parts: the X-ray apparatus with monochromator as a unit block (X-ray unit) and a high precision Coordinate Measuring Machine. Fig.4 presents a sketch of the X-ray unit. The X-ray apparatus has low power ( about 2-3 W ) and electron beam sharply focused by electrostatic and magnetic lens. The details of the X-ray unit construction are described in Ref.[6]. The characteristics of the outgoing X-ray beam after monochromator are listed below:

\begin{tabular}{l c} - Energy & 36.026 (\(K_{\alpha_{1}}Pr\)) \\ - Intensity & \(\sim\) 8000 sec\({}^{-1}\) \\ - Width at the exit slit & \(\sim\) 50 \(\mu\)m \\ - Height at the exit slit & \(\sim\) 22 \(\mu\)m \\ - Horizontal divergence & \(\sim\) 50 \(\mu\)rad \\ - Vertical divergence & \(\sim\) 66 mrad \\ - X-ray tube current & 25 \(\mu\)A \\ - X-ray tube voltage & 90 kV \\ \end{tabular}

The module of the CSCs is placed on the support so that the anode wires are oriented horizontally. The X-ray tube with the crystal monochromator is mounted in such a way that the X-ray beam (narrow in X-direction) should be parallel to the cathode strips. The tube is fixed at a carriage which moves horizontally in X-direction along the horizontal rails. The support on which CSC was placed can be moved in Y-direction. The minimum step in both direction is equal to 22 \(\mu\)m. The position of X-ray beam are measured in both directions by two angle encoders with an accuracy of 10 \(\mu\)m.

Measurement procedure

The calibration of the CSCs includes scanning along the horizontal X axis at one or several Y-coordinates. For each position of the X-ray beam (X,Y) measured by angle encoders the X coordinate of the X-ray absorption point is measured by CSC.

The X coordinate of the point where the initial X-ray quanta was absorbed in the chamber gas is calculated from charges induced on the cathode strips. There are various algorithms to relate the induced charge distribution to the avalanche position. The simplest one is the centre-of-gravity method:

\[X_{calc}=\frac{\sum_{i}iQ_{i}}{\sum_{i}Q_{i}}\cdot a\hskip 28.452756pt,\]

where \(a\) - is the width of the cathode strip. The disadvantage of this method is large systematic non-linearity between true and measured by CSC X-ray beam position because of finite size of the cathode strips. To determine the avalanche position this non-linearity must be taken into account.

It can be shown (see [11]) that there is differential charge-ratio algorithm which has smaller non-linearity:

\[X_{calc}=\frac{Q_{3}+Q_{4}-Q_{1}-Q_{2}}{Q_{2}+Q_{3}-Q_{1}-Q_{4}}\cdot\frac{a}{ 2}\hskip 28.452756pt,\]

where \(\left|X\right|\leq\frac{a}{2}\), \(Q_{i}\) -the charges induced on a sequence of adjacent strips while \((Q_{2},\,Q_{3})>(Q_{1},Q_{4})\).

The CSC calibration carried out by X-ray technique confirms this conclusion. These results will be published elsewhere.

The anode and cathode amplitude typical spectra are shown on Figs.6 and 7. The CSCs was filled by gas mixture 37.5%CO\({}_{2}\)+15%CF\({}_{4}\)+22.5%Ar+25%Xe and were irradiated by 36.03 KeV monochromatic X-ray beam. In energy terms the positions of peaks correspond to the \(K_{\alpha}\) xenon escape peaks E\({}_{K_{\alpha}}\)=6.4 KeV, \(K_{\beta}\) xenon escape peaks E\({}_{K_{\beta}}\)=2.4 KeV and to the E=8.04 KeV of the \(K_{\alpha}\) fluorescent X-ray from copper cathode.

The typical distribution of the X-ray absorption location is shown in Fig.8. The same distributions but with selection of anode amplitude corresponding only \(K_{\alpha}\) xenon escape peak is shown in Fig.9. The wide bump in Fig.8 is due to processes which produce long range electrons. The rms value of this spatial distribution is equal to 72 \(\mu\)m. After event selection taking into account only anode amplitude which correspond \(K_{\alpha}\) and \(K_{\beta}\) xenon escape peak and consequently only process with short range electrons the rms value of this distribution is equal to 55 \(\mu\)m.

Conclusion

The results described above have demonstrated that a narrow monochromatic X-ray beam with energy 36.026 KeV,just above K-edge of xenon, can be used for calibration of CSCs. At such energy up to 6 layers of CSC can be calibrated simultaneously. The existing setup can be used for calibration of the CSC for the ATLAS Forward Muon System.

This note is a result of R&D program which was carried by the PNPI group.
