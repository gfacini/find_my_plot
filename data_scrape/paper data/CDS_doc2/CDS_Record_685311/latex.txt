###### Abstract

This note presents the results of the gas uniformity measurements for the first 4-plane module, complemented by similar studies done on the 8-plane wheel prototype. The gas flow at different straw positions with respect to the inlets was studied using one, two or five inlets to supply active gas at different gas flows. The gas distribution proved to be sufficiently uniform for the 8-plane wheel with the use of two inlets, two outlets and four internally connecting tubes at a gas flow of 27 l/h.

Introduction

One of the properties of an end-cap ATLAS TRT module is to assure the uniform circulation of the active gas through each straw. This requirement is dictated by the fast renewal of the gas, on one hand, and the simplicity of the mechanical design of a basic gas cell (i.e. minimum number of gas inlets/outlets), on the other. The active gas in the TRT will be renewed by a closed-loop system, minimizing thus the loss of the expensive gas mixture (\(70\%\mathrm{Xe}+20\%\mathrm{CF}_{4}+10\%\mathrm{CO}_{2}\)). The active gas has to be renewed for two main reasons:

* Impurities in the gas may occur due to the high ionization current of \(10\;\mathrm{\mu A}\) at the LHC leading to the production of vapours by the detector components. These agents may subsequently be deposited directly on the surface of electrodes and insulators in the straw tube and/or favour the polymerization of radicals in the avalanche [1].
* Gas diffusion and gas leaks will be a major source of change of the gas composition in the TRT. The CO\({}_{2}\) permeability through the straw walls is at least two orders of magnitude larger than that of Xe and CF\({}_{4}\), leading to a continuous and slow increase in the CO\({}_{2}\) concentration ([2] p. 788). (The end-cap TRT will be enclosed in a CO\({}_{2}\)-filled envelope.)

In order to achieve a purity level such that the detector performance will not be compromised, the gas flux has to be at least \(0.1\,\mathrm{cm}^{3}/\mathrm{min}\) for a \(50\,\mathrm{cm}\)-long straw ([2] p. 628), i.e., one active volume per hour.

The presented studies were performed on the first 4-plane end-cap wheel and on the 8-plane prototype built at CERN. These modules served as test-beds for the finalization of the end-cap TRT design. Other measurements that took place on these wheels include wire tension [3], straw eccentricity [4] and gas leak [5].

The experimental framework and the method applied to assess the gas flow in a straw tube is described in Sec. 2. The uniformity of the gas flow is studied in Sec. 3 for a 4-plane module, consisted of \(3\,072\) straws, distributed in four layers and connected to \(96\) electronic boards ('plates') or \(16\) webs, also used to designate the position of the tested straws around the wheel. The gas flow using one or five inlets is examined. In Sec. 4, the study is completed by performing similar studies on the 8-plane wheel prototype, using two inlets and two outlets. The conclusions are summarized in Sec. 5. All experimental amplitude curves are presented in App. A. Finally, the calculation of the signal amplitude as a function of gas flow, as well as another implementation of the method, are discussed in Appendices B and C, respectively.

## 2 Experimental setup and description of the method

The method applied to measure the gas flow velocity in a straw is based on the monitoring of the signal amplitude change induced by a change in the active gas mixture. The straw tubes are irradiated by a \({}^{55}\)Fe X-ray source (\(5.9\;\mathrm{keV}\)). The collimated source is positioned either near the outer end of the straw, or near the inner one, radiating a length of \(\pm 2\) mmalong the straw. The amplitude of the signal at these positions is measured within an error of \(\pm 3\) ADC channels (\(\sim\!1\%\)), using the BridgeVIEW" program analysis.vi, developed to read the CROSS module. The time needed for the scaler to accumulate the necessary number of events limits the accuracy to \(\delta t=0.5\) min. All measurements took place with the wheel placed in horizontal position.

The active gas (Ar and CO\({}_{2}\)) composition was changed at \(t=0\) from \(\mathrm{Ar}\div\mathrm{CO}_{2}\simeq 2\div 1\) to \(\mathrm{Ar}\div\mathrm{CO}_{2}\simeq 1\div 1\) (unless otherwise stated), retaining the same total gas flux (\(\pm 0.5\,\mathrm{l/h}\)) in most cases. As a result, after some time, depending on the position of the monitored straw from the inlet(s), the signal amplitude decreases by 80%, first at the gas-in and then at the gas-out end of the straw. The amplitude time profiles are then fitted by an asymmetric transition function (logistic dose response function)

\[A_{\mathrm{fit}}(t)=\frac{1-h}{1+\left(\frac{t-s}{c}\right)^{b}}+h, \tag{1}\]

where _b, c, h_ and \(s\) describe slope, time for 50% drop of amplitude, final amplitude and a delay, respectively. The initial value of the amplitude is assumed equal to unit.

As seen in the observed time profiles (see plots in App. A), the amplitude falls rapidly when the altered gas starts entering the straw cavity. Afterwards, this drop continues more smoothly and ends asymptotically. The sharp drop is more apparent at the end where gas enters, compared to that at the end where gas exhausts, due to diffusion effects in the tube, which are visible in the latter. Hence, a characteristic variable of the amplitude temporal behaviour is the time point for which the decrease ceases to be steep and becomes asymptotic, i.e. the point of the maximal amplitude drop rate.

This point is mathematically defined as that where the first derivative of the amplitude, \(\mathrm{d}A/\mathrm{d}t\), reaches its minimum value, or equivalently, where the second derivative changes sign, from negative to positive (turning point). The time difference between the turning points of the amplitude time profiles between the gas-out ('2') and the gas-in ('1') end can provide an estimate of the gas flow velocity along the straw. These points are determined analytically using the parameters of the fit:

\[t_{\mathrm{turning}}=c\left(\frac{b-1}{b+1}\right)^{1/b}+s. \tag{2}\]

The 'effective' gas flux, \(f^{*}\), is therefore calculated as

\[f^{*}\equiv\sigma_{\mathrm{straw}}\frac{L}{\Delta t},\quad\Delta t\equiv t_{2 }-t_{1}, \tag{3}\]

where \(\sigma_{\mathrm{straw}}=0.126\) cm\({}^{2}\) is the area of the straw cross section, \(L\approx 30\) cm is the distance between the irradiated points, and \(t_{2}\) and \(t_{1}\) are the turning points of the amplitude versus time curves for the gas-out and the gas-in end, respectively. It is worth noting that \(t_{\mathrm{turning}}\), as computed in Eq. (2), is independent on the initial and final value of amplitude. This is crucial, since the setting of gas composition and hence the initial/final amplitudes--is not very accurate and differs from one measurement to another.

Another tentative approach to the determination of the time required by the gas mixture change to propagate to a specific point along the straw was also considered: the time at which the amplitude reached the 50% of its total decrease. The results obtained with this method were in a rather good agreement with the following ones. However, for this parameter to be accurately measured, an exact determination of the final signal amplitude is needed, which requires a long measuring time. Therefore, it was abandoned in favour of the 'turning point' method.

The correspondence of the effective flux to the actual flux is not generally linear, because of diffusion effects, therefore \(f^{*}\) cannot be used directly for assessing the gas flow uniformity. The calibration of the effective flux is performed by means of a calculation of the expected amplitude evolution in a gas-filled tube due to the influx of gas other than the initial. Besides the forced flow velocity, the calculation (see App. B) also takes into account the diffusion of the altered gas-'2' entering the tube into the gas-'1' already occupying this cavity. The signal amplitude is determined by the relative concentration of both gases. The parameters of the model (positions along the tube, \(x_{1}\) and \(x_{2}\), diffusion coefficient, \(D\)) are chosen so that the expected amplitude-versus-time curves match the observed ones. The scanning of the gas flow velocities and the calculation of the corresponding effective flux provides a calibration curve.

The model does not include the variation of the gas concentration along the outer/inner manifold, before entering the straw. This is the only point where the model does not agree with the observed data (see Sec. 3.3). As a consequence, the positions \(x_{1}\) and \(x_{2}\) found during the tuning: (a) are not equal to the real ones, \(x_{1}\simeq 2\) cm and \(x_{2}\simeq 33\) cm; and (b) are different for the two gas supply modes.5 Therefore, two calibration curves are needed; one for direct and one for indirect gas supply. The former is determined using the experimental curves of App. A.1, A.2, and A.3, while for the latter the measurements presented in App. A.4 are used. The extracted parameters are listed in Table 1 and the calibration curves are shown in Fig. 1 for direct and in Fig. 2 for indirect gas supply. Practically, the effective flux is higher than the calibrated one only for direct gas supply and \(f\lesssim 0.15\) cm\({}^{3}\)/min. In all other cases, \(f^{*}\simeq f\).

Footnote 5: The gas supply scheme for the 8-plane wheel is shown in Fig. 8.

The uniformity of the gas distribution is examined by applying this procedure in straws of various positions around the wheel, for various values of total gas flux, \(F\). The variation of the calibrated gas flux, \(f\), as a function of the azimuthal angle, \(\phi\), provides the measured non-uniformity. Actually, two straws are monitored in each case, since the data acquisition of the setup allows the simultaneous measurement of two channels without any loss in time or accuracy. Consistent amplitude curves were obtained and, hence, only one curve is presented in each case.

A variation of this method was also tested; the gas mixture change is applied for a few minutes and then the initial gas composition is restored. Since the exact implementation

## 3 4-plane module

A first attempt to examine the uniformity of gas distribution in the TRT end-cap wheels was performed on the first 4-plane module of type A. The total volume of the module is the sum of the outer gas manifold volume (\(\simeq 3.6\,\mathrm{l}\)), the inner gas manifold volume (\(\simeq 1.5\,\mathrm{l}\)) and the active volume (\(\simeq 15.1\,\mathrm{l}\)). Hence, assuming that the gas is evenly distributed to the straws, the total gas flux supplied to a 4-plane module has to be maintained at about \(20\,\mathrm{l}\mathrm{/}\mathrm{h}\), in order to meet the specification of one volume per hour. This value is used as nominal for the purposes of this study.

At first, the gas was distributed into the module through five inlets connected to the outer manifold, and was exhausted through four outlets connected to the inner manifold, as shown in Fig. 3. Afterwards, only one single inlet was used, indicated as reference inlet. Results are presented separately for each case.

### Gas supply with five inlets

In order to find the correlation between the measured flux in a straw and the total gas flux supplied to the module, we measured the former at the same straw (web 2D, \(\phi=75^{\circ}\)) for different values of total gas flux, \(F\). The time profiles of the amplitude (actually the relative amplitude with respect to the initial value), \(A\), and their first derivatives are shown in Figures 13, 14, and 15. The amplitude curves are fitted with the function of Eq. (1). For \(F=40\) l/h, the gas composition was changed from \(\mathrm{Ar}\div\mathrm{CO}_{2}\simeq 2\div 1\) to \(\mathrm{Ar}\div\mathrm{CO}_{2}\simeq 20\div 13\), due to technical limitations. This results in a smaller amplitude reduction compared to the other measurements, which does not however affect the validity of the method.

The time profiles have more or less the same shape for all tested values of gas flow, allowing one to make an easy comparison between their characteristics. As the total gas supply, \(F\), increases, the time needed for the gas mixture change to reach the outer end of the straw decreases. This indicates that the timing of the amplitude drop is sensitive to the velocity of the gas, and therefore to the gas flux itself, as predicted by the applied method.

The time derivatives of the amplitude, shown in Figures 13-15 in App. A, are calculated analytically from the fitting function. The turning points are determined from Eq. (2) with a precision of 2-5% depending on the goodness of fit, which in turn yields an error of 3-7% in the time difference \(\Delta t\). The obtained values of effective gas flux, \(f^{*}\), are listed in the sixth column of Table 2. The values of \(f\), as found by using Fig. 1 as a calibration curve, are also listed. Besides the error of the fitting parameters \(P1\), \(P2\) and \(P3\), an error of \(\pm 1\%\) has been included in \(\delta f\) to account for the uncertainty on the tuning parameters.

The dependence of measured flux on the total gas flux is shown in Fig. 4. Gas flux

Figure 3: _Schematic view of the 4-plane module indicating the actual positions of inlets and outlets._depends linearly on the total gas flux with a slope of \((3.0\pm 1.6)\cdot 10^{-4}\), which results from a linear fitting. It is clear thus that \(f\) is sensitive to variations of the gas flow velocity.

The effective gas flux was also measured for various straws in different positions with respect to the gas inlets, under the nominal total gas flux of \(20\;\mathrm{l/h}\). The procedure described in Section 2 was followed, and the related curves are presented in Figures 16-21. The results of these measurements, as well as the positions of the straws from the reference inlet, are listed in Table 3. The obtained values of calibrated flux, \(f\), (also estimated from Fig. 1) versus the position, \(\phi\), are plotted in Fig. 5, where the positions of the inlets are also indicated.

Table 3: _Effective and calibrated gas flux for straws in various positions \(\phi\) around the 4-plane wheel and with the use of five gas inlets and a total gas flux of \(20\,\mathrm{l/h}\)._As shown in Fig. 5, there is no apparent dependence of the measured gas flux on the position of the straw with respect to the inlets. An applied linear fit leads to a slope of \((0.7\pm 0.8)\cdot 10^{-4}\,\mathrm{cm^{3}min^{-1}deg^{-1}}\), which is not significantly non-zero, taking into account the experimental errors. Therefore, a design with five inlets for the gas distribution would assure a uniform circulation of the active gas.

Since the use of five inlets proved to be a sufficient but not necessary condition for a uniform gas flow, it is important to repeat this procedure using fewer inlets. This task is described in the next section.

### Gas supply with one inlet

During the following series of measurements, four out of the five inlets were removed, retaining the one denoted in Fig. 3 as reference inlet. First of all, the impact of a change of the total gas flux on the observed effective flux, \(f^{*}\), was studied. For this purpose, as in the previous section, a specific straw (connected to the web 2A at \(\phi=135^{\circ}\)) was monitored using three different values of \(F\); 10, 20, and 30 l/h. The acquired curves are shown in Figures 22-24. The distance between the two irradiation points, \(L\), the turning points, \(t_{1}\) and \(t_{2}\), as well as the corresponding values for the gas flux variables, \(f^{*}\) and \(f\), are listed in Table 4.

A shown in Fig. 6, the calibrated gas flux depends linearly on \(F\) with a slope of \((3.5\pm 0.9)\cdot 10^{-4}\), which is compatible with the one obtained with the five-inlets configuration, taking into account the experimental uncertainties. It is worth noting that the

\begin{table}

Figure 5: _Calibrated flux, \(f\), versus distance from the reference inlet, \(\phi\), for various straws and with the use of five gas inlets for a total gas flux of \(201\)/h. The positions of the inlets are also indicated by the vertical arrows._

slopes of \(f\) versus the average gas flow per straw, \(F/3072\), is \(0.9\pm 0.5\) and \(1.1\pm 0.3\) for five and one inlet, respectively. The fact that \(slope\simeq 1\) verifies that the measured flux is directly related to the actual flux flow into the straws. The none-zero pedestal in both cases will be discussed in detail in Sec. 3.3.

The gas flow uniformity was studied by irradiating four more straws in different positions, supplied with the nominal flux of 20 l/h. The amplitude versus time curves and their derivatives are shown in Figures 25-28. In these plots, it is clear that the more distant from the inlet is the straw, the more delayed is the arrival of the gas composition change.

In order to quantify these observations, the values of the effective and the calibrated gas flux were calculated. They are listed, together with other characteristic variables, for each tested straw in Table 5 and are presented in Fig. 7.

The observed gas flux drops as one moves away from the inlet, resulting in a non-uniformity of the order of \(\pm 23\%\) around the average gas flux, \(f_{\rm av}=0.20\,{\rm cm^{3}/min}\). However, this observed drop may not be totally due to a non-uniformity of the gas flow, as will be shown in the following section.

\end{table}
Table 5: _Effective and calibrated gas flux for straws in various positions \(\phi\) around the 4-plane wheel and with the use of one gas inlet and a total gas flux of \(201\)/h._

### Effect of diffusion in the outer manifold

The measured values of the gas flux for both number of inlets are significantly and systematically higher than the ones expected; for \(F=201\)/h it corresponds an average of \(F/3072=0.109\) cm\({}^{3}\)/min, which is lower than all values of \(f\) of Tables 3 and 5. The same holds for \(f\) corresponding to other values of \(F\); the pedestals in Figures 4 and 6 are clearly non-zero (\((0.11\pm 0.07)\) cm\({}^{3}\)/min and \((0.04\pm 0.03)\) cm\({}^{3}\)/min, respectively). The \(f\)-vs-\(F/3072\) slopes, however, are almost unit, indicating that this discrepancy is flow-independent.

This difference cannot be associated with diffusion _in the straws_, since the measured flux has been corrected for this effect during the calibration. However, the simple model used to interpret the effective into actual gas flow does not incorporate the diffusion _in the outer manifold_. The latter causes an increasing gas '2' concentration at the crimping tubes of the straws, which in turn leads to a higher measured gas flux. (The model presumes a constant concentration of gas '2' outside the tube; if this increases, the diffusion of the gas into the tube will proceed faster.) It is worth noting that the same effect has been observed during similar studies for the barrel TRT [9].

Moreover, the further the monitored straw from the inlet, the smoother (almost constant during the measurement) the transition from gas '1' to gas '2' in the outer manifold is expected to be. Therefore, the model describes more accurately the experiment in straws located away from the inlet(s). This means that the observed decrease of \(f\) with \(\phi\) in Fig. 7 is _partly_ explained by the inaccurate model, and cannot be fully associated with an actually lower gas flow (non-uniformity).

However, no attempt will be made to quantify this behaviour; an upper limit on non-uniformity will be set instead. This conclusion will be applied in similar measurements performed on the 8-plane prototype described in the following section.

## 4 8-plane prototype

The basic unit for the end-cap TRT, from the point of view of active gas supply, is an 8-plane module, consisted of two identical 4-plane wheels. In the present design, the gas

Figure 7: _Calibrated flux, \(f\), versus distance from the reference inlet, \(\phi\), for various straws and with the use of one gas inlet for a total gas flux of \(20\) l/h._flows inwards through a 4-plane module and flows back outwards through its neighbour, as shown in Fig. 8. The 8-plane wheel is equipped with two inlets6, \(180^{\circ}\) apart, connected to one module ('direct' module) and two outlets also \(180^{\circ}\) apart, connected to the other module ('indirect' module), at the same \(\phi\)-positions as the inlets. Four plastic tubes, \(45^{\circ}\) apart, connect the two modules in the inner volume manifold.

Footnote 6: The notation inlet and outlet characterizes the gas supply configuration at a specific moment; the inlets and outlets are identical from the mechanical point of view.

The method described in Sec. 2 is applied to examine the uniformity of the gas flow around the wheel for this configuration. Measurements are taken for the module designated as module 2 (the second to be constructed), supplied with gas either directly or indirectly. Results are reported for both cases separately.

### Direct gas supply

As with the 4-plane wheel, the same straw was tested for three different values of \(F\). The one chosen is located at an angle of \(\phi=45^{\circ}\) (plate 55) with respect to the position of one of the inlets (\(\phi=0^{\circ}\)). The initial values of total gas flux are 201/h, 301/h, and 401/h, with a gas mixture of \(\mathrm{Ar}\div\mathrm{CO}_{2}\simeq 2\div 1\). At \(t=0\), the contribution of argon is reduced to half leading to an \(F\) of 131/h, 201/h, and 271/h, respectively, with a mixture of \(\mathrm{Ar}\div\mathrm{CO}_{2}\simeq 1\div 1\). This procedure, which was followed for all measurements on the 8-plane wheel, was employed so that the gas change would occur in a single step and no additional adjustments (necessary if \(F\) is to be retained) would interfere. The results, in terms of effective and calibrated flux, are listed in Table 6, whilst the \(f\)-versus-\(F\) curve is shown in Fig. 9.

In Fig. 9, the dependence of the calibrated flux on the total gas flux --and also to the expected gas flux-- is linear, as in the 4-plane module. The slope of \(f\)

\(1.2\pm 0.5\), including unit as expected. The pedestal of \((0.08\pm 0.05)\,\mathrm{cm}^{3}/\mathrm{min}\) is significant and of the same level as in the 4-plane wheel.

This procedure was applied for various points around module 2. The presence of two inlets make the wheel symmetric with respect to a plane perpendicular to it and intersecting it at \(\phi=\pm 45^{\circ}\). Hence, only one quarter of the wheel (positions \(\phi=0^{\circ},\,45^{\circ},\,\,90^{\circ}\)) is set under test, assuming that the results from the other three would be similar. The acquired results are listed in Table 7, where the plate number of the measured straws is also given. The dependence of \(f\) on the position around the wheel is shown in Fig. 10.

As seen in Fig. 10, the gas flow decreases with the distance from the inlet with a slope of \((-1.0\pm 0.4)\cdot 10^{-3}\,\mathrm{cm}^{3}\mathrm{min}^{-1}\mathrm{deg}^{-1}\). This leads to a non-uniformity of \(\pm 22\%\) from \(0^{\circ}\) to \(45^{\circ}\), which represent the extreme cases from the point of view of gas flow.

### Indirect gas supply

The same exercise as for the direct was repeated for indirect flow. The gas flow was reversed by interchanging the inlets and outlets. The results for a specific straw at \(\phi=4\,9^{\circ}\) (plate 61) and various total gas flows are listed in Table 8 and plotted in Fig. 11.

As in all previous cases, the slope of the measured versus the expected flux is almost equal to unit (\(0.9\pm 0.4\)), with a non-zero pedestal of (\(0.05\pm 0.04\)) cm\({}^{3}\)/min. The gas flow

Figure 10: _Calibrated flux, \(f\), versus distance from the reference inlet, \(\phi\), for various straws supplied with gas directly for a total gas flux of \(27\,\)l/h._was measured at two more positions (\(\phi=0^{\circ}\) and \(\phi=97^{\circ}\)). The results are presented in Table 9 and Fig. 12.

The dependence of gas flow as a function of the position around the wheel in Fig. 12 shows a decrease of \(f\), as with direct gas supply. Nevertheless, the slope here is only \((-0.3\pm 0.3)\cdot 10^{-3}\,\mathrm{cm^{3}min^{-1}deg^{-1}}\), representing a variation of only \(\pm 7\%\) in the gas flow among the straws. This is quite normal, taking into account the various cavities (straws plus two inner manifolds) that the gas passes through, which tend to equilibrate the flux.

Another observation made is that the average measured gas flow for an \(F=271\)/h does not exceed the expected one at the same level as for \(F=201\)/h. It is only 39% (32%) higher than the expected for the direct (indirect) gas supply, whilst it is 77% (79%) higher with the use of five inlets (one inlet ). This is normal since the diffusion effects (which cause the discrepancy) become less apparent at higher values of flux.

It has been proposed [6] that a uniform distribution of the active gas would be facilitated by a slightly different gas exhaust scheme. According to this, the two outlets are rotated by \(90^{\circ}\) with respect to the inlets. The longer path between the inlets and the outlets is expected to provide a more uniform gas flow. However, gas flow simulation studies [7] have shown that the two schemes are equivalent regarding gas flow in the straws.

Conclusions

The gas flux in a straw was measured via the signal amplitude drop induced by a reduction in the contribution of Ar in the gas composition. The uniformity of the active gas circulation in the 4-plane module was studied with two different numbers of gas inlets; five and one. The 8-plane prototype was also tested using two inlets in one module and two outlets in the other.

In a configuration with five inlets connected to the outer gas manifold of the 4-plane module and four outlets connected to the inner one, the gas proved to be evenly distributed to the straws using the nominal gas flux of 20 l/h. The use of a single inlet, on the other hand, showed a fluctuation of \(\pm 23\%\) around the average value of the gas flux in the straws, depending on their location with respect to the inlet.

For the 8-plane prototype, two series of measurements were performed; for direct and for indirect gas supply, using two inlets in one module and to outlets in the other. A non-uniformity of \(\pm 22\%\) (\(\pm 7\%\)) was observed with direct (indirect) gas supply for a total gas flow of 27 l/h. Therefore, the gas distribution using two inlets is slightly better than with one, and this design will be adopted for the normal operation of the end-cap TRT. The non-uniformity, on the other hand, can be coped with by supplying the wheel with active gas in a higher rate than the nominal.

## Appendix B Signal amplitude versus gas composition

The diffusion and convection in a gas is described [8] by the differential equation

\[\frac{\partial c}{\partial t}=D\nabla^{2}c-\nabla(c{\bf v}), \tag{4}\]

where \({\bf v}\) is the velocity of the gas flow and \(c({\bf r},t)\) is the gas concentration, expressed in mass, number of molecules, number of moles, or volume at normal conditions of temperature and pressure (N.T.P.) per unit volume. In the case of one-dimensional flow, e.g. along the \(x\)-direction, of constant velocity \(v\), the previous relation becomes

\[\frac{\partial c}{\partial t}=D\frac{\partial^{2}c}{\partial x^{2}}-v\frac{ \partial c}{\partial x}. \tag{5}\]

Let gas '1' be the gas occupying the straw volume and gas '2' the gas entering the straw at \(t=0\). Then the initial condition for the concentration \(c_{2}\) of gas '2' is \(c_{2}(x,0)=c_{0}\Theta(-x)\). I.e., it is assumed that the empty straw corresponds to the region \(x>0\) and the region \(x<0\) is full of gas with concentration \(c_{0}\).

Both Eq. (5) and the initial condition are invariant in the change of variables \(x,t\to y\equiv\frac{x-vt}{\sqrt{4\,Dt}}\). Substituting \(c_{2}(x,t)\) with \(\Phi(y)\) gives

\[\frac{\mathrm{d}^{2}\Phi}{\mathrm{d}y^{2}}=-2y\frac{\mathrm{d}\Phi}{\mathrm{d} y}. \tag{6}\]

The initial condition is then expressed in terms of \(y\) as

\[t=0\Rightarrow\begin{cases}y\rightarrow-\infty\Rightarrow\Phi(-\infty)=c_{ 0}&\text{if}\;\;x<\,0,\\ y\rightarrow+\infty\Rightarrow\Phi(+\infty)=0&\text{if}\;\;x>\,0.\end{cases} \tag{7}\]

If we set \(\Psi\equiv\mathrm{d}\,\Phi/\mathrm{d}y\), then Eq. (6) becomes

\[\frac{\mathrm{d}\Psi}{\mathrm{d}y}=-2y\Psi\Rightarrow\int\frac{\mathrm{d}\, \Psi}{\Psi}=-2\int\mathrm{d}y\,y\Rightarrow\Psi(y)=\Lambda\,e^{-y^{2}}, \tag{8}\]where \(\Lambda\) is a positive constant. Then for \(\Phi\) we get

\[\frac{\mathrm{d}\Phi}{\mathrm{d}y}=\Lambda\,e^{-y^{2}}\Rightarrow\Phi(y)=\Lambda \int\limits_{y_{0}}^{y}\mathrm{d}\xi\;e^{-\xi^{2}}, \tag{9}\]

where \(y_{0}\) is such that \(\Phi(y_{0})=0\), which due to Eq. (7) gives \(y_{0}\rightarrow+\infty\). By applying again Eq. (7), we get the value of \(\Lambda\):

\[\Phi(-\infty)=-\Lambda\int\limits_{-\infty}^{+\infty}\mathrm{d}\xi\;e^{-\xi^{ 2}}=c_{0}\Rightarrow\Lambda=-\frac{c_{0}}{\sqrt{\pi}}. \tag{10}\]

The obtained solution \(\Phi(y)=\frac{c_{0}}{\sqrt{\pi}}\int\limits_{y}^{+\infty}\mathrm{d}\xi\;e^{- \xi^{2}}\) can be written in terms of the error function \(\mathrm{erf}\,y\equiv\frac{2}{\sqrt{\pi}}\int\limits_{0}^{y}\mathrm{d}\xi\;e^{ -\xi^{2}}\), as:

\[\Phi(y)=\frac{c_{0}}{2}(1-\mathrm{erf}\,y). \tag{11}\]

If we substitute \(y\) with \(\frac{x-vt}{\sqrt{4\,Dt}}\) in Eq. (11), we get the concentration \(c_{2}\) of the new gas as a function of \(x\) and \(t\):

\[c_{2}(x,t)=\frac{c_{0}}{2}\left[1-\mathrm{erf}\left(\frac{x-vt}{\sqrt{4Dt}} \right)\right]. \tag{12}\]

The total concentration of gas in the straw expressed in number of moles per unit volume remains constant throughout the gas change, provided that temperature and pressure are stable. Since \(c_{2}(x>0,+\infty)=c_{0}\), then for every \(x\) and \(t\), \(c_{1}+c_{2}=c_{0}\), where \(c_{1}\) is the concentration of gas '1' which occupied the straw volume. Hence,

\[c_{1}(x,t)=c_{0}-c_{2}(x,t)\;\Rightarrow\;c_{1}(x,t)=\frac{c_{0}}{2}\left[1+ \mathrm{erf}\left(\frac{x-vt}{\sqrt{4\,Dt}}\right)\right]. \tag{13}\]

As an example, the time profiles of gas concentration for both gases are shown in Fig. 39, for a gas velocity of \(v=1\,\mathrm{cm/min}\) and \(c_{0}=1\). The positions \(x_{1}=9.2\,\mathrm{cm}\) and \(x_{2}=28.5\,\mathrm{cm}\), corresponding to the experimental curves acquired in direct gas supply (Figures 13-33), are chosen. The time delay of \(20\,\mathrm{min}\) also represents a typical value for the data sample.

The calculated concentrations cannot be compared directly with the observed curves. A function of \(c_{1}\) and \(c_{2}\) representing the signal amplitude has to be employed instead. First of all, a naive approach would be to consider the ratio \(c_{2}/c_{1}\). But, since this ranges from zero to \(+\infty\) for a specific \(x\), it is easily rejected. A function incorporating an arctangent of this ratio, however, does not suffer from such an infinity. Let \(a\) and \(b\) be the initial and the final values of signal amplitude (constant in \(x\)), respectively. Then the function

\[A_{\mathrm{calc}}(x,t)=a-\frac{2(a-b)}{\pi}\arctan\left[\frac{c_{2}(x,t)}{c_{ 1}(x,t)}\right]\;\Rightarrow\]

\[A_{\mathrm{calc}}(x,t)=a-\frac{2(a-b)}{\pi}\arctan\left[\frac{1-\mathrm{erf} \left(\frac{x-vt}{\sqrt{4\,Dt}}\right)}{1+\mathrm{erf}\left(\frac{x-vt}{\sqrt {4\,Dt}}\right)}\right] \tag{14}\]satisfies the initial and final conditions for the amplitude. It also has some other interesting properties, which justify why it was chosen. For \(c_{1}=c_{2}\), it leads to \(A_{\rm calc}=\frac{a+b}{2}\), which is intuitively expected. Moreover, the values of \(A_{\rm calc}\) corresponding to a specific ratio \(c_{2}/c_{1}\) and its reciprocal are symmetric with respect to \(\frac{a+b}{2}\). This indicates that the two gases can be interchanged in the expression for \(A_{\rm calc}\) without effectively changing the shape of the \(A(c_{1},c_{2})\)-curve, apart from a reflection with respect to the axis \(c_{2}/c_{1}=1\). Note that the total concentration \(c_{0}\) is not involved in the calculation of the amplitude.

The calculated amplitude \(A\) derived from the concentration curves of Fig. 40 are shown in Fig. 40. The time derivative \({\rm d}A/{\rm d}t\) is also plotted. Note that the shape of the curves is more or less similar to that of the experimental ones, presented in App. A. The turning point can be determined numerically as point where \({\rm d}A/{\rm d}t\) is minimized. By changing the flow velocity, i.e. the gas flux, in the model, so that the theoretical curves match the experimental ones, a calibration curve between the actual and the effective gas flux can be constructed.

The presented calculation is not meant to provide an accurate model of the experimental setup. Many aspects of the gas circulation, such as the complicated geometry, the effects of turbulence, and the possible compressibility of the gas at some areas is not taken into account. Diffusion and convection are included, though, providing a satisfactory model for the flow in the straws. It can be easily shown and was numerically verified that the turning point in this model is independent on the initial and final value of amplitude, as with the fitting function \(A_{\rm fit}\) (Sec. 2).

Alternative approach of the method

The problem of measuring the gas flow can be also attacked by a variation of the'st andard' method, which was used for gas flow rate studies for the barrel TRT [9]. According to this, the gas composition change lasts for a definite period of time, after which the initial composition is restored. Two irradiation points are monitored, as before, and the corresponding amplitude curves reveal a dip, which can be used to determine the velocity of the gas flow.

For the implementation of the method, the gas change from \(\mathrm{Ar}\div\mathrm{CO}_{2}\simeq 2\div 1\) to \(\mathrm{Ar}\div\mathrm{CO}_{2}\simeq 1\div 1\), lasted about 3 min, starting at \(t=2\min\) and ending at \(t=5\min\). As before, two irradiation points are monitored, at \(x_{1}=4\,\mathrm{cm}\) and \(x_{2}=34\,\mathrm{cm}\), but not both in each measurement. The frequency of the latter is very high (every 45 s at some periods), in order to obtain an as accurate as possible determination of the amplitude dip. Three pairs of straws from module 2 of the 8-plane prototype are tested at three \(\phi\)-positions: \(0^{\circ}\), \(45^{\circ}\), and \(90^{\circ}\). The resulting signal amplitude curves are shown in Fig. 41.

As expected, the amplitude minimum is more pronounced at the gas-in end than at the other, due to the reduced effect of diffusion. However even for a position very near the inlet (\(\phi=0^{\circ}\)), diffusion causes the dip at \(x_{2}\) to be very shallow and thus difficult to be determined. The situation is worsened as we move away from the inlet. At \(\phi=45^{\circ}\), even at \(x_{1}\) the amplitude curve is rather problematic.

This method might proved useful if the parameters of the measurements (duration of gas change, initial/changed gas composition, positions of irradiation) were optimized to increase the precision. However, this would be a rather time-consuming task, which is not worth to be pursued, in view of the already mature results obtained with the standard

Two straws per case were monitored, one of them displayed 30 ADC channels lower than the measured value for better readability. The small vertical bars indicate the minima of each curve._
