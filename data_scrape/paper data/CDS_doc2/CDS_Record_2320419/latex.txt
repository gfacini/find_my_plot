# Study of multiple hard-scatter processes from different \(pp\) interactions in the same ATLAS event

The ATLAS Collaboration

###### Abstract

Given the large integrated luminosity and the large average pileup in the 2017 ATLAS dataset, the probability of having two leptonically decaying \(Z\) bosons originating from separate \(pp\) interactions in the same LHC bunch crossing becomes non-negligible. Such events are searched for and the number observed compared with the expectation. These types of events (also for the case involving other hard scatter processes, such as W, photon or top quark production, in the same event) may cause additional backgrounds for particular physics analyses, and therefore this background must be accounted for when relevant.

## 1 Introduction

In 2017 the LHC delivered about 50 fb\({}^{-1}\)of \(pp\) collision data to the ATLAS experiment. Due to problems with losses from cell 16L2 the LHC ran with the 8b4e filling scheme, limiting the number of colliding bunches in ATLAS to 1866 (25% less than nominal). In order to deliver high luminosity in this configuration a number of other beam parameters (\(\beta^{*}\), emittance and bunch intensity) were pushed to increase the per-bunch luminosity, leading to a very high pileup in ATLAS. In order to keep the pileup level manageable the luminosity was levelled by beam-separation to a value of \(\approx\) 1.5 \(\times 10^{34}\) cm\({}^{-2}\)s\({}^{-1}\) leading to an average number of interactions per bunch crossing (pileup) of about 60. Figure 1 shows the pileup distribution in the full 2017 dataset, with an average pileup of 38. With such a large, and high pileup, dataset the probability of having ATLAS events containing two hard-scatter processes from two different \(pp\) interactions in the same LHC bunch crossing becomes non-negligible.

In this note the number of observed events with two leptonically decaying Z bosons 1 originating from different \(pp\) interactions in the same event is compared with the expectation. These types of events, also including other hard scatter processes such as those involving production of high \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) isolated photon, W boson, Z boson, and \(t\overline{t}\) pairs, may present backgrounds for specific physics measurements and searches, and in that case need to be accounted for, particularly as they are not included in the standard simulation samples used for physics analysis in ATLAS.

## 2 Estimating the number of events with two hard-scatter processes from separate \(pp\) interactions

The number of events in which there are two different hard scatter interactions from different \(pp\) interactions in the same bunch crossing can be estimated as follows:

The number of events with process A is given by:

\[N_{A}=L\sigma_{A}, \tag{1}\]

where L is the luminosity and \(\sigma_{A}\) is the production cross-section for this process. The total number of inelastic interactions on top of the hard process A is therefore:

\[N_{inelastic}=N_{A}<\mu>=L\sigma_{A}<\mu>, \tag{2}\]

where \(<\mu>\) is the average pileup in the dataset. The probability that an inelastic interaction gives a hard scatter process B is

\[P_{B}=\sigma_{B}/\sigma_{inelastic}, \tag{3}\]

where \(\sigma_{B}\) is the production cross section for process B and \(\sigma_{inelastic}\) is the inelastic cross section (taken to be 80 mb at \(\sqrt{s}=\)13 TeV [1]). Putting this all together gives the number of events which have both processes A and B from multiple \(pp\) interactions as:

\[N_{AB}=L\sigma_{A}<\mu>\sigma_{B}/\sigma_{inelastic}. \tag{4}\]

For the case where processes A and B are the same this simplifies to:

\[N_{AA}=L\sigma_{A}^{2}<\mu>/(2\sigma_{inelastic}) \tag{5}\]

where the factor of 2 in the denominator avoids double counting of identical processes. In addition when looking for a specific final state then the cross section should be replaced by the cross section times branching fraction for that final state.

In this note a subset of the 2017 dataset is examined, encompassing the set of data with the highest average pileup. This dataset corresponds to a luminosity of 34 fb\({}^{-1}\) with an average pileup of 40. Applying the above formula for estimating the number of events with two leptonically decaying Z bosons originating from separate \(pp\) interactions in this dataset gives:

\[N_{ZZ}=L\sigma_{Z}^{2}<\mu>/(2\sigma_{inelastic})=34\times 10^{3}\times(5.8 \times 10^{3}\times 2\times 3.4\times 10^{-2})^{2}\times 40/(2\times 80\times 10^{9} )\approx 130 \tag{6}\]

using \(\sigma_{Z}=5.8\times 10^{4}\) pb [2] and the branching fraction of the Z boson to electrons and muons of 3.4%. This number is the expected number of events before acceptance and efficiency has been taken into account.

## 3 Data Analysis

### Event Selection

In order to select data events with two reconstructed Z bosons a simple event selection is used. The event selection considers pairs of oppositely charged electrons or muons forming Z candidates. The event isselected if there are two Z candidates with production points separated in the longitudinal direction by at least 5 mm. Electron candidates are reconstructed as described in Ref. [3], and must satisfy the medium likelihood identification criteria. Muon candidates are reconstructed as described in Ref. [4], and must satisfy the Loose identification criteria. Both electron and muon candidates (commonly refered to as leptons (\(\ell\))) are required to have transverse impact parameter with respect to the reconstructed beam line of less than 0.1 mm, and must satisfy \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) >10 GeV and pseudorapidity, \(|\eta|<2.5\) (for electron candidates the overlap region between the barrel and endcap calorimeters \(1.37<|\eta|<1.52\) is also removed). Z candidates are required to have mass in the range \(80<M_{e^{+}\ell^{-}}<100\) GeV, with the longitudinal impact parameter (\(z_{0}\)) of the two leptons must lie within 2 mm of each other. No requirement is placed on the value of the lepton \(z_{0}\) or on lepton isolation formed from tracking information, as for decays coming from different \(pp\) interactions such requirements would not make sense. A simple calorimeter isolation requirement is applied to the leptons, but the results are found not to depend on if this requirement is applied or not. The events are selected by single- and multi-lepton triggers that are expected to have an efficiency of close to 100% after applying the event selection. The trigger is therefore assumed to be fully efficient for these events.

### Acceptance and Efficiency

The acceptance (\(A\)) and efficiency (\(\epsilon\)) of the selection are estimated using Monte Carlo simulation of single Z boson production. The events are generated with the Powheg [5; 6] generator interfaced to Pythia8[7], using the CT10 parton distribution functions [8]. Applying the lepton \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) and \(\eta\) requirements, and the Z boson mass selection, at generator level leads to acceptance values of 42% (40%) for the \(Z\to\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\) (\(Z\to e^{+}e^{-}\)) samples. The detector response is simulated using the ATLAS simulation framework [9], based on GEANT4 [10], where the simulation includes a realistic description of pileup. The simulated samples are reconstructed in the same way as the data. Using these samples the acceptance times efficiency 2 values are found to be 42% and 26% for the di-muon and di-electron channels (implying a reconstruction efficiency of 99% and 65% respectively).

Footnote 2: Data driven factors to correct the lepton efficiencies (corrections up to a few %) are not applied here.

For events in which two Z bosons are produced in independent interactions the production is completely independent, such that there are no kinematic correlations between the final state particles. This means that the efficiency and acceptance of such events is just the square of the values for single Z boson production (or the multiplication of the di-electron and di-muon values for the case with a \(Z\to\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\) and a \(Z\to e^{+}e^{-}\) decay). The efficiencies and acceptances for the three different decay modes of events with two leptonically decaying Z bosons are shown in Table 1. For this study a systematic study of the uncertainties of the efficiencies has not been carried out, but the uncertainty on the per event efficiencies (averaged over the three channels) is expected to be less than around 5%.

## 4 Results

The number of events observed in the data are compared with the expectation (using equation 5 scaled by the appropriate acceptance \(\times\) efficiency shown in Table 1) in Table 2 for the three different decay channels, and for the sum over all channels. The expected number of events also takes into account the inefficiency due to the requirement that the Z candidates have the longitudinal position of the origin of the leptonsseparated by 5 mm, which gives a 8% inefficiency for a Gaussian longitudinal luminous region of width 3.5 cm. The expected results are in good agreement with the observed number of events. For this study an evaluation of the uncertainties on the expected number of events has not been carried out, the leading systematic uncertainties are expected to be on the efficiency (at the 5% level), the uncertainty on the Z boson production cross section (\(\approx\) 3%), and the uncertainty on the luminosity (and pileup) (at the 5% level for the 2017 dataset). Neglecting these uncertainties is not expected to effect the conclusions of this study.

Figure 2 shows the longitudinal position of the origin of the leptons for one of the Z candidates versus that for the other Z candidate, after the event selection, but before the requirement that these are separated. This is shown for the three different final states, and for the sum of these. All these figures show a band of events where the two Z candidates originate from the same \(pp\) interaction, and a few outliers that correspond to events where the two Z candidates are originating from different \(pp\) interactions. Figure 3 shows the difference in \(z_{0}\) between the two Z candidates, for the sum of all channels, showing 13 events where the Z candidates originate from different interactions.

Figure 4 shows the mass distribution for one of the Z candidates versus the other Z candidate for the observed events in which the Z candidates originate from different interactions. The figures show this for the three final states, and for the sum of these. These show that although there are few events these are generally peaking at the Z boson mass for the two Z candidates. Applying the same event selection but requiring that one of the Z candidates is formed from leptons with the same electric charge selects no events in the data, suggesting that the background level is very small.

Since events in which two Z bosons are produced in independent interactions the production is completely independent, the azimuthal angle between the two Z candidates is expected to be flat for such events. Whereas for events where the two Z bosons are produced in the same interaction, the production is correlated and the two Z bosons should predominantly be produced back-to-back in the transverse plane. Figure 5 shows the difference in azimuthal angle between the two Z candidates for the cases where they originate from the same interaction, and when they originate from different interactions, showing the expected behaviour.

Figure 6 shows an event display of one of the selected data events with the two Z candidates decaying into muons.

\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|c|} \hline Final state & \(A\) (\%) & \(\epsilon\) (\%) & \(A\times\epsilon\) (\%) \\ \hline \(e^{+}e^{-}e^{+}e^{-}\) & 16 & 42 & 7 \\ \(\mu^{+}\mu^{-}e^{+}e^{-}\) & 17 & 64 & 11 \\ \(\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\) & 18 & 97 & 17 \\ \hline \end{tabular}

## 5 Conclusion

The number of events in a subset of the ATLAS 2017 data in which there are two leptonically decaying Z bosons from different \(pp\) interactions, but in the same bunch crossing, is estimated, and compared to the observation in data. The observed number of such events is found to be consistent with the expectation. Such events, also including other hard scatter processes, could present a background for some physics analyses in ATLAS, and in such cases this will need to be taken into account. For most physics analyses a background coming from two independent hard scatter processes in the same event would be greatly reduced by a requiring that the charged particle tracks associated with the processes originate from the same vertex. With the current vertex resolution this would reduce these backgrounds by 98.4% 3.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|} \hline Final state & Number of observed events & Number of expected events \\ \hline \(e^{+}e^{-}e^{+}e^{-}\) & 2 & 2.1 \\ \(\mu^{+}\mu^{-}e^{+}e^{-}\) & 6 & 6.6 \\ \(\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\) & 5 & 5.4 \\ \hline Sum over all channels & 13 & 14.1 \\ \hline \end{tabular}

This is shown for the sum of all channels.

However, the resolution for matching photons to a vertex is much worse, and as such this background is harder to control for the case where one of the interactions yields a high transverse energy photon, which could become a significant background for e.g. \(t\bar{t}+\gamma\), and multi-boson analyses involving photons.
