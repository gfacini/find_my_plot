**Abstract**

PYTHIA 5.6 event generator was used to simulate ZZ, ZW, Z+jets and \(t\bar{t}\) backgrounds to H\(\rightarrow\)ZZ\(\to ll\nu\nu\) signal at LHC. Effects of calorimeter cracks, energy resolution and pile-up of minimum bias events are taken into account. It is shown that Higgs boson with mass between 500 and 700 GeV can be seen on \(E_{T}^{miss}\) distributions as a broad bump above the background dominated by ZZ\(\rightarrow ll\nu\nu\) continuum. A statistical signal significance \(S/\sqrt{S+B}\approx\)10 is expected, provided the present knowledge of the backgrounds is correct.

Introduction

H\(\to\)ZZ -- \(ll\nu\nu\) channel has six times larger branching ratio (\(8\cdot 10^{-3}\)) than that of H\(\to\)ZZ -- 4\(l\). However, the Higgs boson mass cannot be directly reconstructed in this channel and the signal appears as a fairly broad Jacobian peak in \(p_{T}^{\mu\nu}\) or \(E_{T}^{miss}\) distributions. Therefore, the potential of this channel for the Higgs search is largely determined by the magnitudes and shapes of associated backgrounds. In the present paper this subject is studied in detail, using a Monte-Carlo simulation technique. Prospects to find the Higgs boson with \(m_{H}=500\) GeV in one year of low luminocity LHC operation (with \(\int Ldt=10^{5}\,pb^{-1}\) ) and with \(m_{H}\)=700 GeV in one year at nominal high luminocity (\(\int Ldt=10^{5}\,pb^{-1}\) ) are explored.

The following backgrounds have been considered:

* Z-- \(ll\)+jets;
* \(t\bar{t}\) -- WbWb -- \(ll\)bb+\(n(\nu)\), with \(m_{ll}=m_{Z}\);
* ZZ-- \(ll\nu\nu\) continuum;
* ZW-- \(ll\nu\nu\) -- \(ll\nu\nu\)+hadrons,

with \(ll\) (here and throughout the text) denoting a \(e^{+}e^{-}\) or \(\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\) pair.

The effect of a pile-up of several minimum bias (MB) events in the same bunch crossing has also been studied. The simulation program PTTBIA (version 5.6) [1], containing lowest order matrix elements for all the basic processes involved, was used as the event generator. Higher order corrections were simulated using a so-called "parton shower" (PS) approach [2, p.133], implemented in PYTHIA. The default PTTBIA settings (EHLQ structure functions, string fragmentation etc.) were preserved. The following selection criteria, similar to the ones suggested for heavy Higgs search in [2, p.444] and further referred to as the "standard lepton cuts", were used:

* \(p_{T}^{ll}>150\) GeV for \(m_{H}\)=500 GeV,
* \(p_{T}^{ll}>250\) GeV for \(m_{H}\)=700 GeV,
* both high \(p_{T}\) charged leptons (electrons or muons) should have pseudorapidies \(|\eta_{l}|<2\) and transverse momenta \(p_{T}^{l}>20\) GeV.

In addition, the mass range 84 GeV \(<m_{ll}<\) 96 GeV was chosen for Z-boson reconstruction. In the calculations, \(E_{T}^{miss}\) was defined through a vector sum of transverse momenta of all detected particles, except muons with \(|\eta|>\)31:

Footnote 1: We consider the forward detector without muon detection system.

\[E_{T}^{miss}=|\sum_{i}\overrightarrow{p_{T}^{i}}|\]

The default calorimetric pseudorapidity coverage \(|\eta|<\eta_{cat}=\)5 is assumed throughout the text, unless otherwise is stated.

## 2 H\(\to\)ZZ \(ll\nu\nu\) signal

Higgs boson production at LHC is dominated by \(gg\) fusion [3] and vector boson fusion [4]. Matrix elements of these processes are implemented in PYTHIA.

H\(\to\)ZZ -- \(ll\nu\nu\) final state has two (isolated) charged leptons (electrons or muons) with high \(p_{T}^{l}\) and features \(E_{T}^{miss}\sim p_{T}^{ll}\), due to the Z going into neutrinos.

Two event samples, generated by PYTHIA for \(m_{H}=500\) GeV and 700 GeV with \(m_{top}=150\) GeV, proved to be in good agreement with theoretical predictions [2, p.428] for event rates (Table 1).

\(E_{T}^{miss}\) distribution of signal events for \(m_{H}\)=700 GeV is shown in Fig. 1. Note a characteristic shape with the broad peak below \(m_{H}/2\).

In the following sections the conceivable backgrounds to H\(\to\)ZZ -- \(ll\nu\nu\) channel are discussed.

## 3 (Z\(\rightarrow\)\(l\))+jets background

(Z\(\rightarrow\)\(l\))+jets final states also have a pair of isolated charged leptons with high transverse momenta, but \(E_{T}^{miss}\) in such processes arises mainly from

* neutrinos produced in semileptonic decays of heavy quarks from associated jets;
* jets escaping from the detector due to limited coverage and dead regions (so-called "cracks") [2, p.44].

(Z\(\rightarrow\)\(l\))+jets production at LHC has a relatively large cross section 2 dominated by \(qg\) --Z\(q\) and \(q\bar{q}\) --Z\(g\) processes (Fig. 2).

Footnote 2: Assuming the integrated Z production cross-section of \(\sim\)1 nb at \(p_{T}^{Z}\) >100 GeV, as quoted in [2, p.91], and the branching ratio 2:B(Z\(\rightarrow\)\(l\))+jets \(\approx\) 0.066, we obtain \(\sigma_{\rm tot}([Z\rightarrow\)\(l\))+jets \(\approx\) 66pb.

### Parton level study

We started with a sample of 12000 Z+jets events with \(p_{T}^{Z}\) > 100 GeV, generated on the parton level with PS. To speed up the simulation, a threshold on the transverse momentum in hard 2 -- 2 scattering3 was imposed: \(\dot{p}_{\perp}>\) 60 GeV. This cut slightly (by \(\sim\)20%) reduces the event rate. The straighforward choice \(\dot{p}_{\perp}>(p_{T}^{Z})_{min}=100\) GeV is not applicable because after "parton showering" the \(p_{T}^{Z}\) spreads around \(\dot{p}_{\perp}\). We found that in the 100 GeV \(<p_{T}^{Z}<\)300 GeV range the obtained \(d\sigma_{T}^{Z}\) distributions agree with theoretical O(\(\alpha_{s}^{2}\)) calculations [2, p.91] within 20+25%.

Footnote 3: CKIN(3) variable in PYTHIA (\(\equiv\)\(\dot{p}_{\perp\,min}\)).

For further studies we generated two samples of \(150\cdot 10^{3}\) parton level events, with and without PS. In addition to \(\dot{p}_{\perp}>60\) GeV cut, the following cuts:

* \(p_{T}^{Z}\) > 100 GeV.
* \(|\eta_{l}|<2\).
* \(p_{T}^{L}\) > 20 GeV and
* 80 GeV \(<m_{l}<\) 100 GeV

where applied on early stage of event generation in PYTHIA, which allowed us to gain significantly in calculation speed.

We compared our calculations with the results of the dedicated W/Z+jets simulation program LDW [2, p.195], normalized to the full O(\(\alpha_{s}^{2}\)) calculations of [5]. In Fig. 3a the expected numbers of parton level events for \(10^{5}p^{\rm{\mu}-1}\) with \(E_{T}^{miss}\) larger than a specified threshold is shown as function of this threshold. Hashed bands (LDW) and curves (PYTHIA) correspond to different calorimetric coverages (\(\eta_{est}=2,3\) and 4).

From these plots we see that

* at high \(E_{T}^{miss}\), the single jet matrix element approach (PYTHIA, with PS switched off) is unsufficient;
* with PS the situation is better, but at very high \(E_{T}^{miss}\) the Z+jets event rate is still underestimated;
* PTTHIA (with PS) and LDW agree quite well for \(\eta_{est}=4\), which, as will be shown below, is just the minimal pseudorapidity coverage required for the Z+jets background reduction.

### Particle level study

To obtain correct \(E_{T}^{miss}\) distributions the particle level simulation is needed, because at the parton level the important contribution due to neutrinos is missed.

High \(p_{T}\) neutrinos in Z+jets events come mainly from cascade decays of heavy \(q\bar{q}\) pairs produced in association with Z. At LHC energies the Z\(q\bar{q}\) production is dominated by \(gg\) -- Z\(q\bar{q}\) process (Fig. 4a) [6]. Matrix elements with non-zero quark mass for this process [2, p.183] are implemented in PYTHIA. As indicated in [2, p.509], this process provides a good benchmark for a comparison of correct but very time consuming matrix element calculations with approximate but much faster PS approach. The latter predicts fairly well the \(d\sigma/p_{T}^{Z}\) distribution but results in softer \(p_{T}\) spectra for heavy quarks (and, eventually, for final state neutrinos), because of the massless quarks assumption and the characteristic "backward evolution" mechanism of the quark generation in PYTHIA (Fig. 4b). However, for reasons of

CPU time, we sticked to this approach in the present study.

Table 2 shows the number of Z+jets events with different flavour contents in the final state after PS, for \(E_{T}^{miss}>10\) and 100 GeV. It is clearly seen that high \(E_{T}^{miss}\) events are mainly due to the heavy quarks contribution.

In Fig. 5\(E_{T}^{miss}\) distributions of Z+jets events after fragmentation are plotted for \(\eta_{cal}\) =3, 4, 5 and 6. For \(\eta_{cal}\geq 4\) the contribution due to undetected jets drops and the effect of escaping neutrinos becomes dominant at high \(E_{T}^{miss}\). 4 Resulting particle level integrated \(E_{T}^{miss}\) distributions are shown on Fig. 3b for \(\eta_{cal}\) =2, 3, 4 and 5. The coverage "saturation" manifests in merging the \(\eta_{cal}\) =4 and 5 curves together at \(E_{T}^{miss}>150\) GeV. The non-detection of \(|\eta|>\)3 muons was found to have no effect on these distributions.

Footnote 4: We checked that with “detectable” neutrinos the \(E_{T}^{miss}\) distributions are virtually identical with the parton level distributions.

### Pile-up effect

At high luminosities expected at the LHC a pile-up of several semihard QCD interactions ("minimum bias" events) results in a notable background in terms of \(E_{T}^{miss}\). With the total cross-section \(\sigma_{MB}=80\,mb\), \(\sim\) 20 MB events will occur, on average, during every bunch-crossing at nominal high LHC luminosity \(L=1.7\cdot 10^{34}cm^{-2}s^{-1}\) and interbunch spacing \(\Delta t\)=15 \(ns\).

To simulate semihard QCD interactions the multiple parton-parton interaction model with variable impact parameter [7], implemented in PYTHIA, was used. We adopted the procedure described in [2, p.155] and generated \(\sim 10^{4}\) MB events to study their general characteristics (charged multiplicity, \(p_{T}^{ch}\) etc). On average, 25 charged particles with \(<p_{T}^{ch}>\)= 0.45 GeV are expected in very forward region (\(3<|\eta|<5\)) in each MB event. \(3.3\cdot 10^{6}\) pile-up combinations were obtained by mixing \(n_{MB}\)=20, 40 and 60 MB events chosen at random.

In Fig. 6 the \(E_{T}^{miss}\) distributions, normalized to the total selected Z--\(ll\) event rate (\(1.8\cdot 10^{5}\) for \(10^{5}pb^{-1}\) with \(p_{T}^{miss}>250\) GeV and standard lepton cuts imposed), are shown. We found that

* the mean \(E_{T}^{miss}\) value and the corresponding rms-spread are proportional to \(\sqrt{n_{MB}}\) and are not very large (15+30 GeV);
* the difference between the curves increases with growing \(E_{T}^{miss}\) and becomes very large at \(E_{T}^{miss}>100\) GeV.

The forward calorimeter energy resolution and granularity effects were found to be negligibly small, while the finite barrel and end cap energy resolutions (simulated by appropriate smearing of the particle energies, see Section 3.4.2) cause only \(\sim 10\%\) elongation of \((E_{T}^{miss})_{pileup}\) distribution tail.

We conclude that with \(\eta_{cal}\) =5, the pile-up effect is negligible in the heavy Higgs region (\(E_{T}^{miss}>100\) GeV) 5

Energy resolution effects are included.

### Effect of calorimeter cracks and energy resolution

In current ASCOT/EAGLE design there are two regions where the calorimeter response is abnormal:

* between barrel and end cap detectors (at pseudorapidities \(1.3<|\eta|<1.9\)), irregular mainly for electromagnetic (EM) component);
* between end cap and very forward calorimeters (at pseudorapidities \(2.85<|\eta|<3.04\)), irregular for both hadronic and EM particles).

The summed calorimeter response in these "cracks" (further referred to as cracks "1" and "2", respectively) was parametrized according to [8, 9] (see Table 3).

#### 3.4.1 Parton level study

To get an idea of the effect of cracks on \(p_{T}\) measurement, we generated \(10^{8}\) single jet (Z\(\rightarrow\)_ll_+1 jet) events without PS and applied \(p_{T}^{2}>250\) GeV cut. The transverse energy loss, \(E_{T}^{max}\), in such events is equal to the jet transverse energy deposited in cracks.

For every jet, the EM fraction \(f_{EM}\) of its total energy was chosen at random with \(<f_{EM}>=0.33\).6 Thus,

Footnote 6: The underlying model was that a jet consists, on average, of 30 particles carrying equal fractions of the jet energy, one third of them being photons and electrons. \(f_{EM}\) was defined as \(n_{EM}>0\), with \(n_{EM}\) smeared with Poisson statistics, with \(<n_{EM}>=10\).

\[E_{T}^{max}\ {}_{i}=E_{i}^{jet}(f_{EM}\,x_{EM}^{i}+(1-f_{EM})x_{h}^{i}),\ \mbox{for}\] crack "i": \[\mbox{where}\ x_{EM}\ \mbox{and}\ x_{h}\ \mbox{are fractions of deposited EM}\] and hadronic energy taken from Table 3 ( \[x_{EM}=1-y_{EM}\), \(x_{h}=1-y_{h}\)). The \(E_{T}^{max}\) value thus obtained was further smeared with Gaussian distribution, assuming \(\sigma E_{T}^{loss}\ /\ E_{T}^{loss}=0.1\). The resulting \(E_{T}^{loss}\) distributions in the cracks are shown in Fig. 7. We found that

* there is a sizable probability to hit the crack "1" (\(\sim\)0.20), while the probability to hit the crack "2" is small (\(\sim\)0.005);
* at the same time, \(E_{T}^{loss}\) in crack "1" is much smaller than in crack "2";
* energy smearing in cracks and fluctuations of EM energy in jet do not affect \(E_{T}^{loss}\) distributions. We conclude that with the present parametrisation of the calorimeter response in cracks, their effect is negligible, at least for single jet processes on the parton level.

#### 3.4.2 Particle level study and the effect of energy resolution

To get a more complete picture, we generated \(11\cdot 10^{3}\) Z+jets particle level events (with PS and jet fragmentation), with \(\hat{p}_{\perp}\) -threshold at 150 GeV. \(p_{T}^{2}>250\) GeV and standard lepton cuts were applied7.

Footnote 7: The \(\hat{p}_{\perp}\)-threshold was adjusted so as not to spoil \(p_{T}^{2}\) distributions above 250 GeV.

The energy resolution effects were included by smearing particle energies with Gaussian statistics, with \(\sigma_{E}/E\) equal to:

* \(60\%/\sqrt{E}\oplus 7\%\), for hadrons with \(|\eta|<3\);
* \(10\%/\sqrt{E}\oplus 1\%\), for EM showers with \(|\eta|<3\);
* \(100\%/\sqrt{E}\oplus 7\%\), for hadrons with \(3<|\eta|<5\);
* \(50\%/\sqrt{E}\oplus 14\%\), for EM showers with \(3<|\eta|<5\).

Charged particles with \(p_{T}<400\) MeV ("loopers") were not counted. For crack "1" we assumed the same energy resolution as in the barrel calorimeter, while for crack "2" the parametrization from [9], slightly modified, was used:

* \(100\%/\sqrt{E}\oplus 20\%\), for hadrons;
* \(60\%/\sqrt{E}\oplus 10\%\), for EM showers.

Figure 7: \(E_{T}^{loss}\) distributions in the calorimeter cracks: between barrel and end cap (crack “1”, solid line) and between end cap and forward calorimeter (crack “2”, dashed line).

To calculate the transverse momentum of the particle in crack "2", for \(|\eta|<\)2.945 the lower boundary of the end cap was taken for the angle, while for \(|\eta|>2.945\) - the upper boundary of the forward calorimeter.

The total \(E_{T}^{loss}\) in cracks was defined as the vector sum of all individual losses:

\[(E_{T}^{loss}\ {}_{i})_{total}=|\sum_{k=1}^{n_{EM}}\overline{p_{t}^{k}}(1-y_{EM} ^{i})+\sum_{k=1}^{n_{k}}\overline{p_{t}^{k}}(1-y_{k}^{i})|\]

\(E_{T}^{miss}\) distributions including the effects of energy resolution and cracks are shown in Fig. 8(a-e).

From these distributions we conclude that

* the energy resolution effect is dominated by the barrel and the end cap hadronic energy resolutions;
* this effect is important at \(E_{T}^{miss}\) below 100 GeV, where it overwhelms the effect of cracks. Beyond 100 GeV the two effects become comparable but the resulting increase of the event rate is small (\(\sim\) 10%).

The effect of finite muon momentum resolution was also studied 8 and found to be small, compared to the hadronic energy resolution effect (Fig. 8f).

Footnote 8: For calorimeter resolution study, we switched off the \(Z\)–\(u^{+}\)– decay mode, thus retaining only \(Z\)–\(e^{+}e^{-}\) decay mode. For muon resolution study, on the contrary, only \(Z\)–\(\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\) decay mode was retained. We assumed \(\Delta p/p\) typical of the air-core magnet option.

Finally, we conclude that the effects of cracks and energy resolution are negligible for H--ZZ--\(ll\nu\nu\) search.

### Conclusions

The main conclusions about (Z--\(ll\))+jets background are as follows:

* Z+jets background is dominated by neutrinos emerging from semileptonic decays of heavy quarks. The effect of undetected jets can be eliminated by ensuring the calorimeter coverage \(\eta_{cal}\) of not less than \(\sim\) 4.5;
* pile-up effect is negligible in the signal region (\(E_{T}^{miss}>\)100 GeV);
* distributions in the signal region.

## 4 \(t\overline{t}\rightarrow\)WbWb\(\rightarrow\)\(ll\)bb+\(n(\nu)\)

The \(t\overline{t}\rightarrow\)WbWb\(\rightarrow\)\(ll\)bb+\(n(\nu)\) events having a pair of isolated high \(p_{T}\) charged leptons (electrons or muons) from leptonic decays of W's and \(r\)'s may fake the Z boson signature, if \(m_{ll}\sim m_{Z}\).9\(t\overline{t}\) production at LHCis dominated by \(gg\) and \(q\overline{q}\) annihilation and has a large cross-section, which drops rapidly with increasing \(m_{top}\) [2, p.296]. About \(10^{6}\) (\(10^{7}\)) \(t\bar{t}\) --WbWb--\(l\)bb+\(n(\nu)\) interactions are expected for \(m_{top}\)=200 (130) GeV at \(\int Ldt=10^{5}pb^{-1}\). We generated several samples of a few thousand events, with and without PS. The obtained cross sections are in a good agreement with theoretical lowest order calculations [2, p.296]. We observed that

* after all cuts, the major contribution to the background is due to \(ll\)-pairs from W-decays;
* "parton showers" significantly (by factor \(\sim 2.5\)) enhance the rate of events with high \(p_{T}^{ll}\) and \(m_{ll}\sim m_{Z}\).

For further studies two large event samples were generated on the particle level: \(222\cdot 10^{3}\) events for \(m_{top}=165\) GeV and \(100\cdot 10^{3}\) events for \(m_{top}=200\) GeV. 84 GeV \(<m_{ll}<96\) GeV, \(p_{T}^{ll}>\)150 GeV and standard lepton cuts were applied. Resulting \(E_{T}^{miss}\) distributions are shown in Fig. 9. Integrated numbers of \(t\bar{t}\) events with \(E_{T}^{miss}>\)150 and 250 GeV are given in Table 4.

We conclude that \(t\bar{t}\) --WbWb--\(l\)bb+\(n(\nu)\) background is negligible for \(m_{H}\)=700 GeV, but is still serious for \(m_{H}=500\) GeV.

## 5 ZZ\(\to ll\nu\nu\) ("ZZ-continuum") background

### Simulation with leading-order cross-sections

The continuum ZZ-pair production gives rise to ZZ--\(ll\nu\nu\) events expected to be the main background to the Higgs boson signal. At LHC ZZ production is dominated by \(q\overline{q}\) annihilation [10], with \(\sim 3\) times smaller contribution from \(gg\) --ZZ [11].

1000 \(q\overline{q}\) --ZZ full LHC events were generated with PYTHIA and the cross-section obtained, \(\sigma_{ZZ}=10.0\pm 0.3pb\), is in a good agreement with theoretical calculations in the leading logarithm (LL ) approximation (Table 5).

For a more detailed study, we genereated 2000 full events with \(\bar{p}_{\perp}\) threshold at 150 GeV. Standard lepton cuts and \(p_{T}^{Z}>\)250 GeV cut were applied to these events. The resulting \(E_{T}^{miss}\) distribution is shown in Fig. 10, where we note a likeness of its shape to the shape of H--ZZ--\(ll\nu\) signal. The expected ZZ-background rate is as much as \(\sim 55\%\) of the signal rate.

### Radiative corrections

Recent full O(\(\alpha\),) calculations of \(q\overline{q}\) --ZZ cross-sections [12, 13] predict large radiative next-to-leading logarithm (NLL ) corrections to LL cross sections (see Table 5). Moreover, the radiation corrections are expected to grow rapidly with increasing \(p_{T}^{Z}\). The theoretical uncertainties (\(\sim 20\%\)) are mainly due structure functions.

Using the cross-sections from [12], calculated for SSC energies, we determined the ratio

\[\rho(p_{T}^{Z})\]

= ( \[d\sigma/p_{T}^{Z}\] ) \[{}_{NLL}/(d\sigma/p_{T}^{Z}\] ) \[{}_{LL}\]

To a good approximation, it depends linearly on \(p_{T}^{Z}\) and for SSC energies can be parametrized as

\[\rho(p_{T}^{Z}\] )=0.004 \[p_{T}^{Z}+1.1\]

where \(p_{T}^{Z}\) is in GeV. For LHC energies we used

Figure 10: \(E_{T}^{miss}\) distributions of ZZ events, with \(p_{T}^{ll}>\)250 GeV and standard lepton cuts applied (normalized to \(\int Ldt=10^{8}pb^{-1}\) ). Solid line: PYTHIA ; dashed line: same distribution, with NLL normalization

Figure 9: \(E_{T}^{miss}\) distributions of \(t\bar{t}\) events events, with \(p_{T}^{ll}>\)150 GeV and standard lepton cuts applied, for \(m_{T}=200\) and 165 GeV (normalized to \(\int Ldt=10^{4}pb^{-1}\) ).

\(\rho(p_{T}^{2})=\)0.0025 \(p_{T}^{2}+1.0\) as a "scientific guess". As Fig. 10 shows, the **NLL** normalization leads to increasing of the cross-section by factor 1.5. We conclude that ZZ-continuum represents a serious problem. indeed. The following methods to suppress it might be considered:

* jet tagging [14];
* rejection of events with transversely polarized Z's [11]10 by studying the lepton angular distributions in the Z rest frame.

Footnote 10: Z bosons from heavy Higgs decays are almost 100% longitudinally polarized.

### Effect of radiation corrections

According to resent O(\(\alpha_{s}\)) calculations (Table 5), the **NLL** corrections to the ZW cross-section are expected to grow rapidly with \(p_{T}^{2}\), in particular due to a non-Abelian WWZ vertex

The \(\rho\)-ratio, introduced in Section 5.2, was determined using the cross-sections from [15]. At LHC energies it can be parametrized as

\(\rho(p_{T}^{2})=\)0.014-\(p_{T}^{2}+0.6\)

with \(p_{T}^{2}\) in GeV. As Fig. 12 shows, the radiative corrections increase the ZW cross-section by factor of \(\sim\)5, so that it reaches \(\sim\) 40% of the ZZ-continuum cross-section. Possible remedies against ZW-background are the same as listed in Section 5.2 for the case of ZZ-continuum.

## 7 Results and conclusions

In Fig.13 the combined (signal+background) rates, as well as separate background rates, are shown in **LL** approximation, for the cases of \(m_{H}=500\) and 700 GeV. In both cases the Higgs appears as a visible enhancement above the background. The background is dominated by ZZ-continuum, although the \(t\bar{t}\) contribution is also significant for the \(m_{H}=\)500
