## 1 Forward calorimeter geometry

Here one can find the simulation results of the basic version of the composite gas ionization forward calorimeter (FC) for the ATLAS setup[1]. The calorimeter consists of the electromagnetic section (EM) and the hadronic one (HAD). The basic calorimeter version for the simulation has the following features.

* Both sections are composed of the square blocks with the same cross-section (32*32 \(cm^{2}\)) and with the block Z-axis parallel to the beam line. The total calorimeter length is of 2.5 m long with the 5 cm gap between the sections. The forward calorimeter is situated at the distance of 15.4 m from the interaction point and its total cross-section can be described by the circle with the radius R= 1.5 m. The calorimeter has a hole in its center with the radius R= 20 cm which can be filled in the HAD section with the copper passive material.
* The blocks in the EM section with the iron wall thickness of 2 mm have the flaky structure along the Z-axis and consist of 13 iron absorber plates with the thickness of 3 cm. The gas gap between the absorber plates is of 6 mm. The charge is collected from the iron plates installed in the middle of the gas gaps. Each block has 4*4 cells in its cross-section.

* The HAD blocks contain the iron gas ionization tubes with the inner diameter of 0.68 cm and with the iron rod inside (0.36 cm diameter). These blocks have also 4*4 cells in their cross-sections and each cell contains 64 tubes (8*8). When the rod is replaced by the wire, the inner diameter of the tube equals 0.4 cm and the tube number in the cell is 121 (11*11) (the same gas content as in the case of tubes with the rods) or 64 (8*8). Lead is used as an absorber.

The calorimeter is filled with the gas mixture (\(90\%Ar+10\%CF_{4}\)) under the pressure of 15 atm in the EM section and 30 atm in the HAD section.

Other calorimeter versions are determined by the following parameters to be varied:

1. the number of the iron absorber plates in the first calorimeter section and their thickness (the number of gaps between the plates has to be less 13);
2. the type of the absorber material in the second calorimeter section;
3. the type of the gas ionization tubes, their number in a cell;
4. the cell size along the calorimeter radius.

For the simulation purpose lead or iron are used in the calorimeter as absorbers.

## 2 Simulation conditions

The simulation has been done with the help of the GEANT3.15 code. The particle flux from the interaction point sows uniformly some cells area of the FC only (without taking into account the whole ATLAS setup). The particle energy values are in the range of (3-400) GeV.

Most of the amplitude distributions obtained for the analyzed calorimeter prototypes are not fitted to the Gaussian, and we use here the histogram RMS values as an estimate of the amplitude dispersions. The energy resolution parameters are defined from the expression

\[\frac{RMS}{E}=\frac{A}{\sqrt{E}}\oplus B \tag{1}\]by the approximation of the simulated data.

The MINIBIAS and 2-jet events were generated by means of the PYTHIA code[2]. To reproduce the experimental multiplicity distributions of particles[3], the simulation was done with the presence of multiple interactions. The average number of the incoming particles in the forward calorimeter for each primary inelastic interaction (\(3<\eta<5\)) is turned out around of 24. The mean particle energy for the MINIBIAS events is shown in fig.1a. The average number of the incoming particles in the cells along the calorimeter radius R is presented in fig.1b for 10 MINIBIAS events. One can see the large difference in the cell load. The average energy and \(P_{T}\) flow are presented in table 1 for the different number of primary interactions.

The MINIBIAS jets are defined here as a collection of the incoming particles inside the circle with the radius in the range of \(30<R<130\) (cm) in the (X-Y) plane (with the aim to diminish the energy leakage). The same constraint has been used for 2-jet events.

Jets from 2-jet events are defined as a number of the particles in the circle of the radius R = 0.5 in the coordinate plane of \((\eta,\phi)\) variables. (The cone size of R = 0.5 is chosen as the optimum value with the aim to improve the W mass resolution in the presence of an average pile up of 40 MB events [4]). The center of this circle is determined by the particle flow in the range \(|\eta|>3\) from the string evolution during the PYTHIA simulation.

The total \(P_{T}\) value measured with the help of the FC is determined by the sum over all calorimeter cells

\[P_{T}=\sqrt{{P_{(T,x)}}^{2}+{P_{(Ty)}}^{2}}\]

\[P_{(T,x)}=\sum A_{i}sin\theta_{i}cos\phi_{i}\]

\[P_{(T,y)}=\sum A_{i}sin\theta_{i}sin\phi_{i}\]

where \(A_{i}\) is the amplitude in cell \(i\), and \(\theta_{i}\), \(\phi_{i}\) are the center angle coordinates of cell \(i\).

The total amplitude value of a signal is defined as the sum of the cell amplitudes with the weight factors corresponding to both calorimeter sections. These weight factors are determined by the minimization of the following functional:

\[F=\sum^{event}(E-\sum^{cells}(w_{1}A_{1}^{i}+w_{2}A_{2}^{i}))^{2} \tag{2}\]\(A_{j}^{i}\) is the amplitude in cell \(i\) and section \(j\), E is the energy of the incoming particles (E = 100 GeV in the case of a single pion and E = 200 GeV in the case of jets), \(w_{j}\) is a weight factor.

The coordinate resolution for single particle and jet is defined as

\[<x>=\frac{\sum x_{i}*A_{i}}{\sum A_{i}} \tag{3}\]

where \(x_{i}\) - the cell coordinate. For hadronic showers and jets this estimate is quite sufficient. However, for a single electromagnetic shower this definition contains the systematic error, caused by the large cell size in comparison with the transverse size of an electromagnetic shower. To diminish this effect it is convenient to proceed to the polar coordinates r and \(\phi\), where r and \(\phi\) are the radius and the azimuthal angle in the plane perpendicular to the beam axis, respectively[5]. The energy dependence of the coordinate resolution is expressed in the following form:

\[\sigma_{\phi,r}=\frac{A}{\sqrt{E}}+B. \tag{4}\]

It is necessary to mention that because of the longitudinal size of hadronic showers and their initial slope angle, the reconstructed coordinates of the particles are shifted from the true ones. Taking into account the position of the maximum energy deposition and the distance of the calorimeter from the interaction point L, the observed radius can be corrected in the following manner

\[<r>=\frac{\sum(w_{i}*R_{i})*A_{i}}{\sum A_{i}}.\]

\[w_{i}=1.0-\lambda*(0.7+0.2*ln(E))/L.\]

\(R_{i}\) - the radius of the central point in cell \(i\). As a result the reconstructed radius is not shifted from the true one.

The influence of the channel electronic noise is not considered here.

## 3 Simulation results

### Calorimeter response to a single particle

The energy resolution parameters for electrons and pions are presented in table 2. The energy resolution does not depend on the particle entry point[5].

The amplitude non-linearity of a signal for electromagnetic showers is \((2.7\pm 0.7)\%\) (fig.2a) because of the absorber plate thickness (3 cm). The amplitude distributions for electrons have a small tail (fig.3a) due to the passive iron walls between modules in the EM calorimeter section (4 mm). It is the main reason of the large constant term in the electron energy resolution. The value of the parameter B can be decreased in the case of the aluminium block walls[5]. The stochastic term depends on the total length of the EM section and its sampling parameter. The amplitude dependence on the distance between the particle entry point and the module wall is shown in fig.3b. It follows from fig.3 that the amplitude value for electrons decreases by a factor of 0.8 at the wall neighbourhood.

The energy resolution for pions has the complex behaviour depending on the different parameters. The constant term is the measure of the non-uniformity of HAD section and is the function of the compensation parameter e/h. The smaller the EM section length, the smaller the entry angle of particles passing into the HAD section. Therefore the hadron calorimeter non-uniformity becomes more important. For the calorimeter with the same EM length but with the different thickness of the absorber plates, the constant B is determined by the compensation parameter. The behaviour of the stochastic term A can be explained by the detection quality of the electromagnetic showers in the EM section and the relation of the sampling parameters in two calorimeter sections.

It is necessary to note that for the calorimeter with iron as an absorber material in the whole volume, the simulated data are fitted better by the expression

\[\frac{RMS}{E}=\frac{A}{\sqrt{E}}+B\]

In this case the parameter values are less by \(\approx 20\%\) compared with that of table 2.

The amplitude non-linearity for pions is shown in fig.2b. One can see that the value of the non-linearity amount to 20% in the particle energy range of (3-150) GeV and 15% in the range of (9-150) GeV. The energy leakage of hadronic showers in the central calorimeter part can be estimated as 1%(\(\sigma=3.0\%\)) for the EM section length L = 2.5 \(\lambda_{eff}\), where \(\lambda_{eff}\) is the effective interaction length (\(\lambda_{eff}=21\pm 1cm\)). Near 11% of hadrons pass such EM section without any interaction.

The A and B parameters of the coordinate resolution (expr.4) are presented in table 3 for the particles at the average calorimeter radius of R = 60 cm. From the table one can see that for pions these parameters are practically the same for two calorimeter cell sizes (8*8cm\({}^{2}\) and 4*4cm\({}^{2}\)) due to the large size of the hadronic shower compared with the cell one. The coordinate resolution for electrons is entirely determined by the cell size because of the small size of an electromagnetic shower and does not depend on the particle energy in fact.

The \(P_{T}\) resolution is expressed in the same manner as the energy resolution

\[\frac{|\Delta\vec{P_{T}}|}{P_{T}}=\frac{A}{\sqrt{E}}\oplus B(\%),\]

\[\frac{\sigma(|\Delta\vec{P_{T}}|)}{P_{T}}=\frac{C}{\sqrt{E}}\oplus D(\%),\]

where

\[|\Delta\vec{P_{T}}|=|\vec{P_{T}}-\vec{P_{T}}^{meas}|\]

The \(\vec{P_{T}}^{meas}\) is the total measured \(\vec{P_{T}}\) value of the incoming particle after the simulation of the forward calorimeter. The values of the parameters A,B,C,D are presented in table 4. It follows from the data that the \(P_{T}\) resolution is practically the same as the energy resolution. Therefore one can conclude that the given cell size does not affect the \(P_{T}\) resolution.

It follows from table 2 that the calorimeter with the absorber plates of 3 cm thick (iron) and tubes with rods meets the ATLAS requirements.

### Calorimeter response to jets

The jet energy resolution is shown in table 5. There is a small difference in the energy resolution for MINBIAS and 2-jet events because of their different hadronic contents. Thus the hadron energy content in the MINBIAS events is of about 66%, at the same time this value for 2-jet events is of about 75%. As a conclusion the values of the calibration coefficients differ by 10% for these two types of jets.

The constant term in the energy resolution is slightly better for the case of the lead absorber in the HAD section. The energy fraction released in the EM section with 13 absorber plates (3 cm thick) is of about 60% for jets from 2-jet events. In table 5 one can also see the energy resolution parameters for the calorimeter which has the HAD section filled with tubes with the wire inside instead of the rod (in the case of 2-jet events). There have been considered two versions of the HAD section:

(a) with the same gas volume as in the basic version (the tube number in a cell is 11*11) and

(b) with the same number of tubes as in the basic version (the tube number in a cell is 8*8).

For (a)-variant the energy resolution is the same compared with the basic calorimeter version in spite of the different absorber type in the HAD section. At the same time for the (b)-variant the energy resolution is the worst.

In fact, the amplitude non-linearity is absent for the MINIBIAS jets because of the energy value of these jets is increased mainly through the increasing number of particles in them, with approximately the same energy distribution of particles. Another situation can be seen for jets from 2-jet events in fig.4a. The amplitude non-linearity can be estimated here as 7% in the energy range of (100-800) GeV. It is better than in the case of a single hadron. The energy value of this jet type is increased due to the increase of the particle energy. The value of the non-linearity does not differ in the cases of lead or iron absorbers in the hadronic section because of a larger amount of the energy released in iron material than in the lead absorber (\(\approx\) 80%) taking into account the whole calorimeter volume.

The coordinate resolution of jets is given in tables 6 and 7.

The value of the energy leakage for jets is constant in the analyzed energy range and can be estimated as 1%(\(\sigma\) = 2%) for the EM section length of L = 2.5 \(\lambda_{eff}\).

In table 8 one can see the fitted resolution parameters values A,B,C,D from expression (5). The average \(|\vec{P_{T}}(jet)|\) values for the MINIBIAS jets are in the range of (1-3) GeV and the same for 2-jet jets are of (5-50) GeV.

## 4 Influence of the copper PLUG in the calorimeter cavity

In the central calorimeter cavity can be situated a copper shield (PLUG) for the accelerator equipment. The shield has the form of a cylinder with the outer radius \(R_{1}\)= 20 cm and the inner radius \(R_{2}\)= 3 cm. The copper shield has the length of the whole calorimeter for simplicity. It is necessary to check the maximum influence of the PLUG, that is the influence of the maximum energy flow in this region. At the same time there is no possibility to define jet in the pseudorapidity range \(\eta>5\) with the help of a calorimeter. That is why the PLUG influence is checked on the sample of MB events. Two methods were used to do these estimations.

First one uses fast simulation of the lateral shape of the hadronic energy shower. The cell content is calculated by the integration of the lateral shower density distribution[6]. This distribution does not depend on the particle energy. It is supposed that each electron releases its energy in the same cell which it hits. One can find details in Appendix 1. The simulation results are presented in fig.5 in the case of PILE-UP value of 40 MB events. From these data it follows that the contribution of the additional \(P_{T}\) value from the copper passive material is small compared with the total \(P_{T}\) value measured in the forward calorimeter and the dispersion of the measured \(P_{T}\) distribution is much greater than the influence of the passive material in the calorimeter cavity.

With the aim to check this conclusion the second method has been used which also uses the fast simulation method but another and more precise description of the lateral shower profile for hadrons and leptons, which depends on the particle energy. The obtained results which are very close to that of fig.5 are not shown here. Some details of this approach are presented in Appendix 2. In fig.6 one can see the measured \(E_{T}\) and \(\Delta E_{T}\) distributions in the Forward and Backward calorimeters together. Here \(E_{T}=|\vec{E}_{T}|\), where

\[\vec{E}_{T}=\sum_{i}\vec{E}_{i}^{T}.\]

\(\vec{E}_{i}^{T}\) is the measured transverse energy vector in cell \(i\) and

\[E_{i,X}^{T}=E_{i}\sin\theta_{i}\cos\phi_{i},\]

\[E_{i,Y}^{T}=E_{i}\sin\theta_{i}\sin\phi_{i},\]

where \(E_{i}\) is the energy deposited in cell i, \(\theta_{i}\) and \(\phi_{i}\) are the polar and azimuth angles of cell \(i\) in the ATLAS setup. The sum is taken over all cells in the Forward and Backward calorimeters. The difference \(\Delta E_{T}=|\Delta\vec{E}_{T}|\) is defined as

\[\Delta\vec{E}_{T}=\vec{E}_{T}^{PYTHIA}-\vec{E}_{T},\]\[\vec{E}_{T}^{PYTHIA}=\sum_{j}\vec{E}_{j}^{T},\]

where \(\vec{E}_{j}^{T}\) is the transverse energy of particle \(j\) from PYTHIA. The summation is over all particles in the pseudorapidity range \(|\eta|\geq 3\). The energy resolutions of the Forward and Backward calorimeters, expressed in a short form of (1), has been taken to be \(90\oplus 7(\%)\) for hadrons and \(50\oplus 5(\%)\) for electrons. In fig.7 the \(E_{T}\) and \(\Delta E_{T}\) distributions, measured in the total calorimeter system, are presented. The size of a shower has not been taken into account in the cases of the Barrel and Endcap calorimeters. It is supposed that for these cases all particles deposit completely their energy in a cell which they hit. The energy resolution of the Barrel and Endcap calorimeters has been chosen to be \(50\oplus 3(\%)\) for hadrons and \(10\oplus 1(\%)\) for electrons. From fig. 6 and 7 one can see that the \(\Delta E_{T}\)-distributions are similar for both cases. The copper PLUG improves the \(\Delta E_{T}\)-resolution by the value of \(\approx 10\%\). One can see from fig. 7 that \(\Delta E_{T}\) "measured" in the whole calorimeter can achieve the values greater than 100 GeV due to the PILEUP effect. It is somewhat bigger than in the paper[6] where the shower size did not take into account and another values of calorimeter energy resolution were choosen.

Therefore it is evident that the impact of the passive copper material in the Forward and Backward calorimeters is small enough and cannot affect the overall \(P_{T}\) resolution.

## Appendix 1. Method 1. The lateral shower parametrization.

The energy of the incoming hadrons is spreaded over the calorimeter cells according to the average transverse energy distribution in the hadronic shower. The analitical form of the lateral energy spreading was taken from the paper [7], where the hadronic showers were studied for the 150 GeV pions in the Pb/Sci calorimeter. The measured lateral energy distribution of the average shower can be expressed in the following form

\[rf(r)=B1\exp(-r/\lambda_{1})+B2\exp(-r^{2}/\lambda_{2}{}^{2}),\]

where \(\lambda_{1}=14.5\) cm, B1=2.82, \(\lambda_{2}=3.88\) cm, B2=15.0. For the calorimeter area \(ds\) being away from the shower centre on distance \(r\) the energy \(f(r)ds\) is assigned. Distribution (2a) was used for all hadrons. The energy dependence of the parameters \(\lambda_{1}\) and \(\lambda_{2}\) is weak enough and may be neglected. The constants B1 and B2 are renormalized in accordance with the hadron energy. The cell energy is equal to the integral of this distribution over the cell area. We integrated over the cell c0, which is hit by the hadron and over the neighbour cells c1, c2,..., c8 (see figure below). The rest energy is distributed uniformly over the cells c9, c10,..., c20, where each cell has got the energy proportional to the energy of the adjacent cells. Apparently, this approximation works well when the main part of the hadron energy is got by the cells c0, c1,..., c8. For our cell size it is equal to 86% in average.

## Appendix 2. Method 2. The lateral shower parametrization.

It is known that of about 95% of the hadron shower energy is deposited[11,12] in a cylinder with the radius of one nuclear interaction length \(\lambda_{0}\) and 99% of the electromagnetic shower energy is deposited[9,10,12] in a cylinder with the radius of \(3.5R_{M}\). \(R_{M}\) is the Moliere radius. In this work the hadronic transverse shower density is integrated over the area of \(1.5\lambda_{0}\) radius. The integration region radius for the electromagnetic shower is of \(3.5R_{M}\). The shower energy out of the integration region is shared among the cells adjacent to the bound ones in the fraction proportional to the deposited energy in these bound cells. The experimental data, obtained for hadrons in the energy range of (10-100) GeV at the scintillation uranium calorimeter ZEUS[8], are used to determine the hadron transverse shower density distribution. In the work mentioned the hadronic transverse shower profile is parametrized by

\[\frac{dN}{dx}=\alpha_{1}(E)\exp\left(\frac{-|x-x_{0}|}{\alpha_{2}(E)}\right)+ \alpha_{3}(E)\exp\left(\frac{-|x-x_{0}|}{\alpha_{4}(E)}\right)\]

where \(\alpha_{i}(E)\) is the coefficient logarithmically depending on the energy E of the incoming particle. The hadron transverse shower density distribution is expressed according to the work[13,15] through the coefficients \(\alpha_{i}(E)\) with the help of the Bessel functions of the imaginary argument.

The electromagnetic transverse shower density distribution[13] is taken as

\[f(r)=r^{\frac{\alpha}{2}-\frac{1}{2}}\exp\left(-\lambda_{x}r^{\frac{1}{2}}\right)\]

where \(r=\sqrt{x^{2}+y^{2}}\), \(\alpha=\frac{1}{2}\). The value of \(\lambda_{x}\) is calculated from the data of the work[14].

The integration of hadronic and electromagnetic shower distributions over an assembly of cells corresponding to each incoming particle leads to the large computer time expenses. To reduce these expenses some approximations are used. It is known that the electromagnetic shower parameters are not depend nearly and the hadronic shower parameters depend logarithmically on the incoming particle energy. In this connection the entire energy range \((0,\infty)\) is divided into ten intervals \((0,15),(15,25),(25,35),(35,45),\)\((45,55),(55,65),\)\((65,85),(85,115),(115,485),(485,\infty)\) for hadrons and there are not any divisions for electrons. All particles from each energy interval have the sameshower parameters which are determined for a particle with the energy

\[E_{i}^{med}=E_{i}+(E_{i+1}-E_{i})/2\]

and \(E_{med}=(10,20,...,300,700)\) GeV.

\[\alpha_{j}(E)=\alpha_{j}(E_{i}^{med})\]

Then the incoming particle energy is distributed on the calorimeter cells according to the calculated shower distribution taking into account the coordinates of the particle entry point.
