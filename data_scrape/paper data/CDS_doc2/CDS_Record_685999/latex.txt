We present concepts for the technical implementation of the optical alignment monitoring systems for the ATLAS muon spectrometer. In particular, the applications of multi-point straightness monitors (using collimated laser beams and transparent optical position sensors) and the implications for muon chamber layout and construction are discussed.

Alignment Concepts

Accurate alignment of the precision chambers of the ATLAS muon spectrometer is essential in order to achieve the required momentum resolution. Continuous monitoring of the chamber positions is necessary to guarantee the alignment tolerances over time. The baseline for the layout of the optical alignment system has been described in [1].

The ATLAS muon spectrometer consists of three layers of precision chambers which measure the sagitta of a traversing muon in the toroidal field of the superconducting air-core magnet. The layers are segmented into chamber modules which individually can be produced with sufficient internal mechanical precision (see the layout of the muon spectrometer in Figures 1 and 2.

The alignment concept for the Monitored Drift Tube (MDT) muon chamber technology [2] includes several optical monitoring systems. The internal stiffness of the individual chamber segments will be controlled by a set of straightness monitors integrated into the chamber planes. Two alignment rays run along the sides of each chamber parallel to the tubes complemented by two diagonal rays. Assuming that the in-plane alignment system allows to treat the muon chambers as planar and rigid objects, muon sagitta measurements are only affected by relative movements of these chambers in the three consecutive layers traversed by a muon.

With the air-core toroid magnet, an efficient method of monitoring the relative position of the chamber layers is a projective alignment scheme which has been adopted as baseline for the barrel part of the muon spectrometer [1], [3]. The geometrical layout of the chambers is strongly coupled with the alignment requirements. The muon chambers are arranged in projective towers of three layers. The corners of the chambers lie on lines going through the interaction point. The chambers belonging to a tower measure the sagittae of high-momentum muon tracks coming from the interaction region.

For the optical monitoring, the projective lines are represented by light rays pointing through the chambers corners to the interaction region. Straightness monitors connecting the chamber corners measure the false sagittae of the light rays in the bending plane and in the \(r\phi\) projection which are due to relative misalignment of the chambers in a tower. From these measurements, corrections can be derived for the measured sagitta of each traversing muons by interpolating between the corners. The projective geometry introduces constraints which allow to minimise the number of independent measurements and the number of alignment beams required for reliable corrections. Four alignment rays per tower with 2-dimensional position measurement are sufficient to correct for relative shifts, rotations and homogeneous thermal expansion of the chambers [1], [4]. Corrections for more complicated distortions in general require additional alignment rays in between the chamber corners.

The goal for the sagitta corrections is a precision of better than 30 \(\mu\)m rms including in-plane alignment and local projective tower alignment. The highest precision is required in the bending plane of the magnetic field (\(rz\)). False sagitta measurements in the transverse (\(r\phi\)) plane provide additional information which is required with 4 beams per chamber, but with lower accuracy. Position measurements of the signal wires relative to the reference rays are required with a precision of 20 \(\mu\)m in the \(rz\) plane and with about 100 \(\mu\)m accuracy in the transverse plane [1]. This includes intrinsic resolution of the optical measurements as well as precision mounting of the optical elements.

While in-plane alignment will be needed for all chambers, projective alignment systems will likely be implemented only for the large chamber towers in the barrel (see the \(r\phi\) chamber layout in [1]. The small chamber towers at the position of the superconducting coils can be aligned relative to the large chambers with tracks crossing the overlap between small and large chambers.

For the reconstruction of low-momentum tracks crossing adjacent towers in the bending plane and for invariant mass measurements of several particles measured in different towers, global inter-tower alignment with modest precision of a few hundred microns is necessary. A solution with optical methods which comes automatically with the projective alignment system is described below.

The tolerances for the initial positioning of the chambers can be relaxed and redundancy added to the projective alignment of the barrel spectrometer by monitoring the internal straightness and the relative parallelity of the barrel chamber layers as a whole [1]. This can be achieved with two axial light rays per octant and layer connecting globally all chambers along the \(z\) axis. Angular displacements between the three layers can be monitored by using two sets of three parallel high rays generated with precisely mounted beam splitters on rigid carbon fiber reference beams. The axial reference beams are supplemented by proximity measurements between the chambers in the z direction. The axial alignment systems again is used only for the large chamber towers.

For the endcap part of the spectrometer, projective alignment rays can in general not be realised because of the endcap magnet cryostat blocking the lines of sight. Full geometric reconstruction of the relative end cap chamber positions is therefore necessary. This requires more information which can be obtained with additional distance measurements between the chamber layers along connecting light paths which in general are not projective (6-8 of such beams per octant are estimated to be sufficient). This scheme relies on the assumption that the radially segmented octants of the endcap chamber layers (see [1]) can be treated as single rigid planar objects. The global planarity of the chamber segments therefore has to be accurately monitored. This can be achieved with two radial light rays per octant which connect all chamber segments parallel to the chamber planes [4]. This principle has already been introduced in [5]. For the large, azimuthally segmented outer endcap octants, additional radial and azimuthal straightness monitors are necessary. The planarity monitoring is supplemented by proximity measurements between the chamber segments.

## 2 Implementation of the Alignment Concepts

### Laser Beams as Alignment References

Collimated laser beams are well suited as straightness references over large distances. Diffraction limited laser beams are characterised by their limited (minimum and maximum) diameter over a given distance. An initially Gaussian beam profile does not alter during propagation of the light. The relation between maximum diameter \(w_{max}\) and distance \(\ell\) at a given wavelength \(\lambda\) is \(\ell=\pi w_{max}^{2}/4\lambda\). The beam waist has a diameter of \(w_{min}=w_{max}/\sqrt{2}\). Over a distance of 10 m, for example, the laser beam can be limited to a maximum diameters of about 3 mm at wavelengths of 690 nm and 780 nm, respectively. Both wavelengths,still in the visible range, can be produced by relatively inexpensive laser diodes (silicon and GaAlAs) and are suitable for use with the optical position sensors discussed below.

The required beam parameters can be produced with suitable collimator optics. Stable Gaussian beam profiles are produced by coupling the laser light into a single mode optical fiber with small core diameter of a few micron which only propagates the ground mode of the laser beam. For laser diodes in the visible and infrared spectral range this has become a standard technique developed for tele-communication applications. Safety will be no problem with typically \(2\,\mathrm{mW}\) laser power in the visible range emitted from the fiber. This is plenty of power for the precise position measurement with the optical sensors [6]. With the laser light coupled into optical fibers, it can be distributed via fiber cables to the individual alignment stations. One laser can supply several alignment beams with the help of fiber splitters which are available from the tele-communications industry. Particularly cost effective are monolithic \(1\times 4\) splitters which can be cascaded. All fiber optics elements have been tested and fulfill the specifications [6], [7].

### Multi-point Straightness Monitors with Transparent Sensors

Multi-point straightness monitors using collimated laser beams and transparent optical position sensors offer flexible solutions for the alignment of extended structures. Transparent position detectors based on the principle of silicon strip photodiodes have been developed for this application [6]. Double-sided strip sensors based on amorphous silicon technology are now available with position resolutions in two coordinates on the order of \(1\)\(\mu\)m and optical transmission rates in the \(80-90\%\) range at wavelengths of \(690-780\) nm. Such a system offers the following features:

* The laser beam can be detected at multiple consecutive stations without being blocked. With the above sensor transmission rates, more than \(20\) sensors can be placed in one beam.
* The position sensors provide a large measurement range (\(20\times 20\) mm\({}^{2}\) or larger if needed) appropriate for the expected movements of the muon chambers.
* The system can span large distances with a single collimated laser beams avoiding accumulation of measurement errors.
* The system is adaptable to large and varying incidence angles between laser beam and sensors. This allows simplified mounting of the sensors without adjustments.
* The optical position sensors provide absolute and robust position measurement for one or several laser beams. The position response is direct and instantaneous (the speed of the system depends on the level of multiplexing).

In the following we discuss applications of multi-point straightness monitors for the alignment of the ATLAS muon chambers.

### Projective Alignment of the Barrel

An important aspect for the technical implementation of the projective alignment system is its impact on the chamber layout and construction. The goal must be to make the muon chambers, including the installation of the associated alignment systems, as uniform as possible and to minimise the number of holes in the chambers to simplify the chamber construction and to avoid acceptance losses. The multi-point alignment system with transparent sensors allows to optimise the alignment system and the chamber layout with respect to these criteria.

For the projective alignment of the barrel muon chamber towers, the position sensors are precision mounted near the 4 corners of the chambers in each layer such that the projective laser beams can pass through. Since many sensors can be aligned on one beam, the projective beams at the corners of adjacent chambers in \(z\) can be combined thus reducing the number of projective alignment paths in the barrel by almost a factor of 2. The transparent sensors belonging to neighbouring chambers overlap in the common laser beam (see Figures 3-5). For common alignment of the (large) chamber towers in \(rz\) this results in 6 sensors per beam. Common alignment of adjacent chambers has the additional advantage that one gets the required proximity measurements between the chambers in \(z\) for free without extra systems needed. The overlapping sensors of the projective systems provide automatically precise 2-dimensional proximity information in the \(z\) and \(x\) coordinates at each chamber intersection as well as global inter-tower alignment information.

Common projective alignment beams can also be used for adjacent chambers in \(r\phi\), i.e. for common projective alignment of large and small chamber towers, in case optical monitoring of the small chambers is needed. This would provide global inter-tower alignment in the \(r\phi\) plane with some absolute position information inside the barrel spectrometer due to the rotational symmetry constraint in \(r\phi\). For common beams in \(rz\) and \(r\phi\), 9 to 12 sensors per beam are necessary, depending on the small chamber layout, which can be easily realised with existing sensor technology [6].)

After minimising the number of projective alignment paths and optical systems it is still desirable to reduce as much as possible the number of holes in the chambers where the projective beams have to go through. In principle, it is desirable to mount the projective alignment system on the spacers (see [2]) of the muon chambers at their center-of-gravity where it is easiest to relate to the in-plane and axial alignment systems which will be located there (see next section). However, in this case one has to cut holes in the tube layers of every chamber. The position, size and angle of the holes varies from chamber to chamber because of the varying inclination angles of the projective beams (see Figure 6).

An alternative possibility, proposed here, is to mount the optical sensors on the inner surface of the outer (MO) chamber layer as well as on the inner surface of the middle (MM) and inner (MI) layer. In this case, holes in the outer and inner chamber layers can be completely avoided (see Figures 3-5). Moreover, the projective alignment paths can be chosen such that they do not touch the small chambers (see Figure 1). Then holes for the projective beams are only necessary in the middle layer and there only once at every chamber intersection in \(z\) (see Figure 4). In this way acceptance losses are minimised and chamber construction is simplified considerably.

In this scheme, the optical elements are mounted directly on the tube layers where they canbe referenced to the wire positions in one tube layer which are precisely defined in the tube end plugs. Transfer of the projective alignment measurements on the chamber surfaces to the center-of-gravity of the chambers can be done with sufficient precision compared to the chamber resolution since relative angles between the chamber layers are measured precisely with the axial alignment system described below. Angular resolutions of \(50\,\mu\)rad and \(200\,\mu\)rad around the \(x\) and \(y\) axes are sufficient which correspond to required position resolutions in \(y\) and \(x\) on the order of \(50\,\mu\)m and \(200\,\mu\)m, respectively. Precision mounting of the optical elements relative to the wires can proceed in the following way.

Precisely machined mounting plates with \(3\) precision pin holes are glued onto the tube layers at the corners of the chambers where the alignment beams will pass through (see Figure 7). During the glueing procedure, the mounting plates are adjusted under a microscope such that the position of the pin holes is precisely defined relative to a reference mark on the tube endplugs which defines the wire position in the tubes. Into the pin holes in the mounting plate fit \(3\) precision pins on the mounting pieces for the optical sensors (see Figures 8 and 9). The muon chambers are installed with the precisely glued mounting plates but without the sensor mounting pieces. The latter will be put into their well defined positions on the mounting plates after the chamber installation in order to avoid damage to the sensors and the precision pieces.

The precision mounting pieces have arms on which the sensors sit above holes of the size of the sensitive area in such a way that the sensors of neighbouring chambers can overlap in a common laser beam (see Figures 3-5, 8 and 9). The sensor mounting pieces have the same shape and dimensions for all chambers, in all three layers and for different projective angles. The sensors can operate with varying entrance angles of the laser beams and can therefore be mounted uniformly with their faces parallel to the chamber planes.

The sensors will be preinstalled on a substrate together with the integrated readout chips, one for each strip coordinate ( compare [6]). The ASIC chips are currently being developed at the MPI Munich. They will contain full analog multiplexing of the strips with a common amplifier and ADC for all channels. Therefore there will be only \(6\) cable lines for each sensor, \(3\) for each strip coordinate (signal, timing and power). The substrates with sensors and electronics are glued on the arms of the mounting pieces and adjusted under a microscope such that the sensor strips are precisely positioned relative to the pins on the mounting piece ( see Figure 8). The precise positioning of the sensor strips on the mounting pieces is transfered via the mounting plates to the wires. The sensors are mounted with their sensitive faces downward in order to help protect them from accumulation of dust etc. The modular mounting procedure makes it relatively easy to replace failing sensors.

If one wants to avoid holes in the small chambers completely, one has to move the sensor position at the inner tube layer of the large MO chambers from the tube endplugs to the inside of the chambers along the tubes by approximately \(30-40\) cm. The tubes in the inner layer of the MM chambers have to be shortened by about the same amount where the projective beam passes through. This is evident from Figure 1 (see also Figures 4 and 7). The transfer of the sensor mounting pieces from the endplugs can be done with the help of the precision mounting plates which extend from the endplug position to the position of the projective beam. Fine-tuning of the overlap region between small and large chambers would be helpful to minimise the transfer distance and shortening of tubes (acceptance losses in the MM layer). The minimum number of tubes which have to be shortened to make holes for the projective beams in the MM layer is shown in Figure 6 for a typical sensor measurement range of \(20\times 20\) mm\({}^{2}\) and the two extreme projective angles. Tubes can be installed around the projective beams in the space between the chamber layers to secure the alignment paths and shield the laser beams from thermal fluctuations in the air.

The light sources are installed on the MO layer pointing projectively to the interaction point. They are mounted together with the first sensor on the same precision piece (see Figure mount2). The special mounting pieces for light sources and sensors can, like the other mounting elements, be made identical for all chambers and projective angles. The laser sources consist of the following components [6]: a laser diode with power control circuit coupled to a single-mode optical fiber, available in compact housing, and a compact fiber collimator optics (with typically 10 mm diameter and 20 mm length) which can be connected to the output fiber of the laser diode via a standard connector. This allows for easy replacement of failing laser diodes, mounted without precision at a safe and accessible place.

The collimator optics is mounted in such a way that it is adjustable around the \(z\) and \(x\) axes on the mounting piece. The direction of the beam can be individually adjusted after the installation of the chambers and alignment sensors and then mechanically fixed relative to the first sensor on the same mounting piece. The first sensor has the purpose to accurately measure the position of the center of the laser beam emitted by the collimator relative to the sense wires. After this calibration, the sensor could in principle be removed. We assume that it will be left there for permanent monitoring of the beam position and angle.

Since the laser sources are already connected to optical fibers, it is straight-forward to distribute the laser light via optical fibers and fiber splitters. From both the costing and the installation points of view, it turns out to be optimum for the barrel projective alignment to supply 4 alignment beams, belonging to one tower, with a single laser diode. With common alignment beams for adjacent towers, one needs a laser for every second tower in \(z\); one laser has to supply two additional beams at the end of the barrel. The fiber distribution system for the barrel consists of about 600 m of single-mode fiber cable.

The number of lasers, laser beams and optical sensors needed for the projective alignment of the barrel in the layout of Figure 2 and with the scheme described above are given in Table 3. Note that the proximity measurements between the barrel in chambers in \(z\), also counted in the table, require no additional systems but are automatically included in the projective alignment with overlapping sensors.

The overlapping sensor system shown in Figure 3 can also be used as a proximity sensor if there is no projective beam forseen at the chamber intersection, e.g. in a possible scheme with "logical" towers instead of the physical chamber towers with their individual projective beams. This system can also be used for radial proximity measurements in the endcap chambers (see Section 2.6).

### Axial Alignment of the Barrel

To increase the redundancy of the projective alignment system in the barrel and to relax on the initial positioning requirements for the projective towers, an axial alignment system is forseen for the large chambers (only) which monitors the global planarity and relative parallelity of the three chambers layers in each barrel hemisphere. The axial system consistsof 2 laser beams per large chamber layer, octant and hemisphere with 2 transparent sensors [6] per chamber and beam. The sensors give 2-dimensional position information with on the order of a micron resolution in the \(x\) and \(y\) coordinates. For the chamber layout of Figure 2, 10 sensors have to be traversed by one laser beam. This is easily achieved with the available sensor technology.

The external reference systems for the 4 sets of 3 parallel laser beams for the 3 chamber layers in one barrel octant are given by 6 rigid carbon fiber rods at the four corners of the octant and at the center at \(\theta=90^{\circ}\). The two central rods connect the axial alignment systems of the two barrel hemispheres (if needed). The reference bars are oriented radially on each side of the octant in \(r\phi\). On each of the reference bars at the barrel corners 3 laser sources are mounted at well defined distances which correspond to the 3 chamber layers. The reference bars for each large chamber octant are connected azimuthally via the distance between the sensors in the chamber spacers.

After traversing the sensors in the chamber spacers, the axial laser beams are received by sensors on the opposite reference rod at the center of the barrel. Three sensors are mounted on each of the central carbon fiber rods. These sensors have the same precise relative distance as the laser sources. They are used to precisely monitor the parallelity of the axial beams. A precise ruler is used to fix the distances between the optical elements on the reference rods to identical values on all rods. The precision on the positioning of the optical elements on the reference bars can be improved by accurately measuring their positions with optical methods. The sensors on the central rods are shared by the two opposite laser beams in the two hemispheres. The carbon fiber bars can be referenced individually to the detector inside the muon spectrometer to control the parallelity of the axial beams relative to the proton beam line which is required with lower precision.

The laser sources can be individual collimator optics, supplied by one laser per reference rod via optical fibers and fiber splitters (see previous section). Alternatively and prefered here, the parallel beams are produced by precisely aligned radial laser beams running along the reference rods through 3 accurately positioned beam splitter prisms. The numbers of lasers, beams and position sensors for the axial alignment system are summarised in Table 3.

The sensors are mounted, perpendicularly to the beam, at the four corners of the chambers in the spacers close to the chamber middle plane. The sensor housings have 3 precision pins, referenced to the sensor strips, which fit into 3 precision holes in the spacers which are defined relative to the in-plane alignment system. The sensors for the axial system can then be put in place during the final stage of the installation of each chamber when it is moved into its exact position. No further adjustments of the optical elements are needed.

### Proximity Measurements in the Barrel

In addition to the relative angle measurements with the axial laser beams, precise proximity measurements between the chambers in the \(z\) direction are forseen in order to increase redundancy of the barrel alignment system. It may also become possible with this system to reduce the number of projective rays in the barrel by going from physical projective chamber towers to "logical" towers where projective beams at intermediate chamber intersections in \(z\) can be omitted. There will, however, be less redundancy.

The multi-point projective alignment monitors with overlapping sensors connected to neigh bouring chambers (see Section 2.3) automatically provide precise 2-dimensional proximity measurement between adjacent chambers in all layers as is evident from Figures 3-5: no extra systems are needed. In the "logical" tower scheme, the overlapping sensor systems shown in Figure 3 can still be used as proximity sensors at the chamber intersections where there are no projective beams. For pure proximity measurements, the laser source can be replaced by a cheaper LED with a focusing lens suitable for the short distance between the two overlapping sensors. If not combined with projective rays, the pure proximity systems are mounted on the chamber spacers. The same system can be used for radial proximity measurements between chambers in the endcaps (see Section 2.6).

3-dimensional proximity measurements in the \(x\), \(y\) and \(z\) coordinates are possible with the described proximity systems by adding a second light source, an LED with lens, with the light beam perpendicular to the sensor surfaces. In this way, a combined system of local axial straightness and proximity systems can be realised together with the projective systems, i.e. without extra equipment.

### Radial Alignment of Endcap Chambers

For the endcap spectrometer, projective light beams are not possible. Therefore absolute reconstruction of relative chamber positions is necessary [1]. Distances are measured between the octants of the endcap chamber layers (FI, FM and FO) which itself have to be treated as single rigid planar objects. The endcap chamber octants are segmented radially and (in the FO layer) azimuthally for reasons of chamber construction (see Figures 1 and 10). The global planarity of the endcap layer octants can be controlled with radial and (for FO) azimuthal multi-point straightness monitors, supplemented by radial proximity sensors between the chamber segments.

The radial alignment systems are of the same type as the axial systems in the barrel (see Section 2.4). Two laser beams per octant and layer run radially along the edges of the octant and are measured by two transparent sensors on each chamber segment. The sensors are integrated in the chamber spacers in the same way as for the axial alignment system, one at the start and one at the end of the chamber along the beam. Since the sensors can accommodate varying incidence angles of the beam, they can be mounted uniformly with their faces aligned with the chamber support frames. The numbers of transparent sensors per radial beam are the following (compare Table 3: 6 sensors in the FI layer with 3 radial segments, 10 sensors in the FM layer with 5 radial segments and 8 sensors in the FO layer with 4 radial segments. The small chambers at the outer radius of the FM layer are aligned with tracks relative to the large chambers as in the barrel.

The collimator optics for each beam is mounted, fixed with the first sensor, at the outer radius of the layer. The laser light is distributed by optical fibers in a similar way as in the barrel. In the optimised solution, one laser supplies 4 beams via an optical fiber splitter. About 400 m of fiber cable are needed for the light distribution in the endcaps.

The radial straightness systems are supplemented by radial proximity monitors between the chamber segments which are located near the chamber corners. The radial proximity monitors can be realised and implemented (on the chamber spacers) in the same way as the pure proximity systems described for the barrel (see Section 2.5).

In the outer endcap layer (FO), the octants are in part also segmented azimuthally (seeFigure 10). For the two azimuthally segmented radial FO segments, straightness and proximity monitoring in the radial and azimuthal coordinates can be combined with one radial and one tangential beam per octant along the intersections of the segments. The beams are monitored by 2 sensors per beam and chamber where the sensors of adjacent chamber segments overlap in the common beam. In total, there are 8 sensors for each beam. These multi-point monitors are mounted on the spacers in the middle plane of the chambers.

With the high transmission rates above 80% which can be reached with the transparent sensors (see Ref. [6]), adjacent FO octants can also be radially aligned with a common laser beam and overlapping sensors from neighbouring chambers as for the projective alignment in the barrel. Each beam would traverse 16 sensors. This option reduces the number of radial beams and gives global alignment constraints for the whole layer.

## 3 The Number of Optical Monitoring Systems

We use the layout of the muon spectrometer in Figures 1 and 2 to count the required numbers of alignment systems, light beams, lasers and optical sensors (see Table 3).

The barrel spectrometer consists of 10 large chambers per octant in each of the three layers MI, MM and MO, in total 240 large chambers in 80 projective towers. Each large chamber tower is monitored by 4 projective beams. Using multi-point monitors with transparent sensors, the beams at the intersection of two chambers in \(z\) are common for these chambers. There are 6 sensors in each projective laser beam, 3 for each of the two adjacent towers, except for 4 beams at the ends of each barrel octant where there are only 3 sensors per beam. In total, 176 projective alignment systems are needed in the barrel, with 176 laser beams and 960 position sensors. In an optimised light distribution system via optical fibers, one laser supplies 4 light beams (6 light beams at one end of each barrel octant). The projective system therefore requires 5 lasers per octant, 40 in total, with 48 standard \(1\times 4\) fiber splitters.

The axial alignment system for the large barrel chambers consists of 6 axial laser beams in each hemisphere of a barrel octant, in total 96 axial systems. Each of the 96 axial beams traverses 2 transparent sensors on each of the 5 monitored chambers per layer in each hemisphere and is received by an additional sensor (on the central reference bar) which is shared by two opposite beams in the two hemispheres. Therefore there are 11 sensors per axial beam. Of the 1008 sensors in total, 48 are shared by two beams. The 3 parallel beams per reference bar are supplied by one laser via 3 beam splitter prisms. 32 lasers are needed for the 96 axial systems.

The axial alignment system is supplemented by 432 proximity systems, 2 at each chamber intersection in the \(z\) coordinate. The proximity measurements between adjacent chambers in all layers are automatically provided by the common multi-point projective alignment systems.

The endcap spectrometer contains 224 large chambers which are optically monitored, 48 in the FI layer, 80 in FM and 96 in FO. Each octant has 3 radial segments in FI, 5 in FM and 4 in FO. The outer 2 radial FO segments are each split in two halves. The three layers FI, FM and FO have two radial beams per octant with two sensors for each beam and each radial chamber segment. There are 6 sensors per radial beam in FI, 10 in FM and 8 in FO.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|} \hline  & Monitoring systems & Lasers & Sensors \\ \hline Barrel projective & 176 & 40 & 960 \\ Barrel axial & 96 & 32 & 1 008 \\ Barrel proximity & 4 32 & – & – \\ \hline Endcap radial/planar & 1 28 & 32 & 1 024 \\ Endcap proximity & 256 & – & 51 2 \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 1: The numbers of monitoring systems (light paths), lasers and optical sensors required for the alignment systems with transparent sensor technology in the barrel and endcap regions of the ATLAS muon spectrometer. Barrel proximity measurements are automatically included with the projective alignment system. Pure proximity systems (for the endcaps) do not require a focussed laser beam, asimple LED light source is sufficient.
