**Introduction**

The full scale prototype of a BIL chamber ("Calypso") built from Pavia-Rome Labs using the assembly scheme proposed by the Seattle group [1], has been analysed at the CERN X-ray tomograph facility [2] in order to verify the wire location accuracy that can be achieved with this construction method.

We have analysed the 5 scans done with the X-ray tomograph on 4 different locations of Calypso:

* 3 bars
* normal pressure
* normal pressure
* normal pressure
* normal pressure.

For all the scans we have 1D data (only z coordinate(1) of the wires for the 6 multilayers). For scan a) we have also 2-D data. All the data have been provided by the X-ray tomography group.

Footnote (1): We have used the standard ATLAS Muon reference system with z perpendicular to the tube direction and y orthogonal to the chamber plane.

### Data analysis

In order to evaluate the reproducibility of the X-ray tomograph measurements in the z coordinate we have compared the two measurements in the same position(measurement a) and b)), disregrading the effect of the pressure. The residuals of one measurement respect to the other are shown in fig. 1; the r.m.s. is \(\sim\)3 \(\mu\)m for the first 3 layers and \(\sim\)4.5 \(\mu\)m for the second multilayer (at larger distance from the X-ray source). Better results (\(\sim\)2 \(\mu\)m) are obtained comparing the 5 measurements of the reference ruler in a) to e) (fig. 2). Therefore we have assumed in the following analysis that the tomograph contribution to the uncertainty on the wire positions is negligible.

For every layer, the measured z-positions of the wires have been fitted on the nominal grid with two free parameters: z\({}_{0}\) and pitch. The pitches for the six layers are shown in fig. 3 for all the measurements a) to e); the R.M.S. of the residuals respect to the nominal grid are shown for each layer in fig. 4. Disregarding measurements c) and d) (that have obviously better positioning) the layers 1-3 and 4-6 exhibit residuals between 13 and 19 \(\mu\)m; layers 2 and 5 (middle ones) are between 21 and 25 \(\mu\)m.

The measured pitch for all the layers is in very good agreement with the nominal one (30.008 mm).

### Data analysis

The outcome of the 2-D data analysis consists of a measured grid of the (z,y) positions of the wires. The grid can be fitted on the nominal one. In the following we present the results of the fits done on data from scan a).

A preliminary fit to the 2 multilayers separately has shown a relative shift of 150 \(\mu\)m between the two multilayers with a negligible relative tilt, and a distance in y between the 2 multilayers of 231.870 mm (between the centers of the 2 multilayers).

In the first combined fit of the two multilayers (fit-1 in the following) we have therefore shifted one multilayer respect to the other by 150 \(\mu\)m and we have assumed the measured \(\Delta\)y = 231.870 mm as the distance between the centers of the 2 multilayers. Then we have fitted the 2-D measurements to the nominal grid (assuming z pitch = 30.008 mm and y pitch = 25.989 mm corresponding to a tube diameter of 30.008 mm) with 3 free parameters: z\({}_{0}\), y\({}_{0}\) and one angle \(\alpha\). Fig. 5 summarizes the \(\sigma_{\rm z}\) and \(\sigma_{\rm y}\) for each individual layer (fig. 5a) and the true average z-coordinate of every layer (called displacement in the plot) as a function of the vertical coordinate y (fig, 5b). From fig. 5b it is clear that in z there is a systematic shift between the top and bottom layer of each multilayer, in the same direction of the shift between the two multilayers; therefore it may indicate a non orthogonality of the X-ray tomograph reference system at the level of \(\sim\)0.6 mrad.

In order to investigate this alternative interpretation of the data we have performed a second fit (fit-2) with a non-orthogonality angle \(\gamma\) as an additional free parameter. The results are shown in fig. 6; the fitted value of \(\gamma\) is \(\gamma\) = 0.6 mrad. As can be seen from the figure the relative shifts of all the planes have almost disappeared while the r.m.s. are of the same order of magnitude as in fig. 5.

The residuals in z and y for all the 189 wires from the fit-2 (few are missing in the reconstruction) are shown in fig. 7; \(\sigma_{\rm z}\sim\)18.5 \(\mu\)m \(\sigma_{\rm y}\sim\) 23.5 \(\mu\)m. The residuals for the 2 multilayers separately are shown in fig. 8; the \(\sigma_{\rm y}\) for the layers 1-3 (glued with the Seattle glue dispenser [1]) seems better. Figs. 9 and 10 show the \(\Delta z\) and \(\Delta y\) of each individual wire for the 6 multilayers. No systematic is visible in z; in y, layers 4-5-6 seem to exhibit some systematic pattern clearly visible up to 50 \(\mu\)m. It should be taken into account that the multilayer 4-5-6 was the first one glued to the cross-plate and was therefore sensitive to cross plates deformation during the second multilayer glueing.

Finally fig.11 shows the vector displacements of the measured grid with respect to the nominal one, according to fit-2; a part from some edge-effects near the end of each multilayer, no systematic distortion of the wire locations is visible.

## Conclusions

The X-ray measurements of the wire positioning in the Calypso chamber show a wire pitch and a layer separation very near to the project values. The residuals around the nominal positions are inside specifications in z and few microns in excess in the wire coordinate. The observed relative displacements of the layers can be accounted for assuming a non-orthogonality of the tomograph reference system at the level of 0.6 mrad.
