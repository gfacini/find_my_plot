###### Abstract

Silicon microstrip detectors with 50 micron readout pitch were connected to fast LHC-type analogue readout electronics (DMILL SCT32A) and their performance evaluated before and after irradiation. The p-type strips with a length of 4 cm were fabricated on high-resistivity n-bulk wafers by CSEM. Fast neutrons from the TRIGA research reactor in Ljubljana were used to irradiate detectors to two different fluences: 4.5\(\times 10^{13}\)/cm\({}^{2}\) and 1.5 \(\times 10^{14}\)/cm\({}^{2}\) 1 MeV neutron equivalent non-ionizing energy loss.

A \({}^{90}\)Sr \(\beta\) source setup was used for detector performance measurements. Most of the observed signal/noise degradation after irradiation could be attributed to the signal loss. Around 82 % charge collection efficiency was measured at higher fluence 100 V above full depletion voltage as determined with \(C-V\) measurements. Measurements were performed during annealing and reverse annealing of effective dopant concentration.

## 1 Introduction

Future experiments at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) built at CERN will have to deal with extreme conditions in terms of radiation and short bunch crossing time (25 ns). For example silicon microstrip trackers will be exposed to about 100 kGray of ionizing dose while the non-ionizing energy loss (NIEL)of hadrons in silicon will be equivalent to the NIEL of around 2 \(\times 10^{14}\) 1 MeV neutrons/cm\({}^{2}\). Both, detectors and readout electronic should be designed in a way to survive 10 years of operation under such conditions. The short bunch crossing time and trigger delay require fast electronics with pipelining of events at 40 MHz for every channel up to the first trigger decision (approximately 2 \(\mu\)s after the event). Analogue [1] and binary [2, 3] electronics have been developed in radiation hard processes.

Irradiation of silicon detectors with fast heavy particles results in a change in effective dopant concentration (\(N_{eff}\)) and therefore a change in full depletion voltage (FDV). The annealing of dopants is followed by the so called reverse annealing in which the concentration of acceptors increases. No reverse annealing of leakage current has been observed.

A detector connected to read-out electronics should be operated at voltages high enough to get sufficient charge collection efficiency. Generally, if high charge collection efficiency (CCE) is required, a voltage higher than FDV is needed. Electric breakdown and thermal runaway limit the maximum voltage which may be applied to the detector, thus potentially degrading the CCE.

Studies of charge collection efficiency at different fluences and its development with detector annealing and reverse annealing are needed in order to estimate detector performance during its operation at LHC. It is also important to determine the relation between FDV and the voltage required for efficient operation, since most of the annealing and reverse annealing studies were done by means of \(C-V\) measurements only. Therefore we have irradiated detectors with neutrons to two different fluences and studied the time dependence of performance with an analogue chip specially developed for LHC applications. We have used a set up with a \({}^{90}\)Sr source to study CCE before and after irradiation.

## 2 Detectors

Two equal single-sided detectors, hereafter refered as B01 and B02, with a strip pitch of 25\(\mu\)m and thickness of 280 \(\mu\)m have been used for these studies. \(p^{+}\) strips of 4 cm length and 10 microns width were fabricated on high-resistivity n-bulk wafer by CSEM and biased through polysilicon resistors. A single guard ring was used as the guard structure. The read-out electronics was AC-coupled to every second \(p^{+}\) strip. The detectors were mounted on a support frame. A Pt-100 sensor was contacted to the same support near the detector for temperature monitoring.

Leakage currents and FDV were determined from \(I-V\) and \(C-V\) measurements using the Keithely-237 instrument as a voltage source and current meter, while HP-4284A was used as a capacitance meter. The FDV of the detectors was about 60V before irradiation, leakage current was approximately 5 nA/cm\({}^{2}\) measured at FDV and room temperature.

## 3 Electronics

Detectors were connected to the SCT32A read-out chip [1] fabricated in the radiation hard BiCMOS DMILL process [5]. SCT32A is a 32 channel fast analogue read-out chip with amplifier peaking time of 25 ns. The output from the preamplifier is sampled every 25 ns into a 2.8 \(\mu\)s long pipeline integrated in the chip. A coincidence between clock pulses and signals from the photomultiplier was used to select the events sampled in the peak of the output from the preamplifier. For that purpose very narrow NIM pulses (2-3 ns) were used (Fig. 1). A glass fan-in between chip and detector was used, that enabled several bondings to the same chip.

The number of dead channels has increased from initially none to 2 for the detector irradiated to low-fluence and to 8 for high fluence irradiation. It is possible that this happened due to bonding errors, since the same glass fan-in was used for all measurements. Checking bonds under the microscope did not give clear evidence for this explanation, since it was difficult to identify contacts between the bonds. Therefore the dead channels were excluded from the analysis.

Irradiation

The detectors were irradiated with neutrons from the TRIGA reactor. The experimental channel allows irradiation of samples in the reactor core. The neutron flux is tuned with the power of the reactor. At the highest power, samples may be irradiated to LHC comparable fluences within a minute. During the irradiation detectors were reverse biased and cooled with water/glycol mixture flow through a small cooling block being in thermal contact with the detector support frame. The B01 was irradiated to the normalized fluence of \(\Phi=4.5\cdot 10^{13}\) n/cm\({}^{2}\) and the B02 to \(\Phi=1.5\cdot 10^{14}\) n/cm\({}^{2}\). Here the normalization damage factor \(0.895\pm 0.05\)[6] to express the damage in terms of 1 MeV neutrons has been taken into account. Activation of golden wire was used for neutron dosimetry. Fluence accuracy is estimated to be about \(\sim 10\%\). Taking into account the additional uncertainity of the NIEL normalization factor the overall error on normalized fluence is about \(\sim 15\%\). The conditions during and after irradiation are shown in Table 1.

The detectors were kept at the reactor one week after irradiation, since the radiation level was to high to move them to the laboratory. This was mainly due to the activation of cooling block. During this time they were biased and kept at low temperature (Table 1) in order to slow down the annealing process. When the detectors were brought to the laboratory, the bias was switched off and detectors were bonded to the electronics. All the measurements were performed in the refrigerator. In this way it was possible to perform tests at different temperatures.

## 5 Experimental results

### Signal and Noise

The signal/noise ratio (S/N) is the most important property for evaluating the detector performance. It affects the position resolution and, even more important at LHC conditions, occupancy of the detector by noise. The S/N

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|} \hline detector & normalized flux [n/cm\({}^{2}\) s] (time) & during: \(T\) (bias) & after: \(T\) (bias) \\ \hline \hline B01 & \(\phi=1.8\cdot 10^{12}\) (25 s) & \(T\approx 5^{\circ}\)C (60V) & \(T\approx 5^{\circ}\)C (200V) \\ B02 & \(\phi=6.3\cdot 10^{11}\) (240 s) & \(T\approx 0^{\circ}\)C (190V) & \(T\approx-20^{\circ}\)C (190V) \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 1: Conditions (normalized flux, temperature and bias) during and one week after the irradiation.

ratio is affected by irradiation due to the signal degradation and increase of noise.

The reason for the signal degradation is creation of trapping centers due to the lattice damage. The maximum output signal is obtained if all charge carriers created by ionizing particles are collected at detector electrodes in a time shorter than the peaking time of the preamplifier. If some charge carriers are trapped during their drift in the electric field, only a part of the full charge is induced at the input of the preamplifier. In general, the increase of noise may be attributed partially to the increase of leakage current and partially to the increase of the interstrip capacitance after irradiation.

We have performed a series of signal and noise measurements to estimate the detector performance after irradiation. The signal was determined as the cluster signal satisfying the following cuts: S/N of cluster \(>5\), at least one (central) strip with S/N \(>4\). Neighbouring strips exceeding S/N=2 are also included in the cluster. Detectors were kept at \(T=25^{\circ}\)C for 12 hours before the first of these measurements was performed so most of the beneficial annealing of effective dopant concentration already took place.

The S/N ratio measured at different bias voltages before and after irradiation may be seen in Fig. 2a. Its voltage dependence is mainly dominated by the charge collection efficiency, which is reflected in measurements of most probable cluster signals (Fig. 2b). The dependence of noise on voltage is quite weak (Fig. 2c), thus having only a small influence on the S/N behaviour. Noise expressed in units of electrons was obtained by a calibration step signal (36 mV) on input test capacitor (100 fF) integrated in the chip.

For irradiated detectors we define \(U_{s}\) as the voltage obtained by the intersection of two linear functions fitted to two different slopes of the most probable cluster signal vs. voltage plot (Fig. 2b). In this way the definition of \(U_{s}\) is equivalent to the definition of FDV in the \(C-V\) method. The full depletion voltage determined with the \(C-V\) method at 10 kHz (\(T=-11^{\circ}\)C) before signal and noise measurements was approximately 45 V for low fluence irradiated detector and about 220 V for high fluence irradiated one. This can be compared to \(U_{s}=105\)V and \(U_{s}=325\)V, respectively.

It is obvious that at high fluence additional overdepletion of the detector is required in order to obtain efficient charge collection. In addition the signal does not saturate for irradiated detectors at higher voltages. This is in agreement with measurements of C. Leroy et al. [4]. The signal increases with the slope \((5\pm 1)\,e_{0}\)/V (B01) and \((8\pm 1)\,e_{0}\)/V (B02).

We have also measured the signal and the noise at different temperatures. No systematic temperature dependence of noise nor signal may be observed in the temperature range from \(T=5^{\circ}\)C to \(T=-27^{\circ}\)C (Fig. 3). The noise of the irradiated detector may be estimated from the equation:

\[ENC_{irr}=\sqrt{\left((ENC_{irr}+\Delta C\,\beta)^{2}+I_{r}\,\tau\,e_{0}\right)} \tag{1}\]

where \(ENC_{irr}\) is the noise measured with the non-irradiated detector for which \(I_{r}\,\sim\,0\), \(\Delta C\) is the increase of the strip capacitance after irradiation, \(\beta\equiv 33\,e_{0}\)/pF [1], \(I_{r}\) is the leakage current per strip, \(\tau=25\)ns is the peaking time of the preamplifier and \(e_{0}\) is elementary charge. Leakage current as measured at \(T=-11^{\circ}\)C and calculated from the total detector current (without guard ring) was 30 nA per strip (B01) and 98 nA per strip (B02) after irradiation both corresponding to the leakage current damage constant \(\alpha(T=20^{\circ}\)C) = \(5.7\cdot 10^{17}\) A/cm. The contribution of shot noise for B02 at this temperature is

Figure 2: Voltage scan of non-irradiated detector B02 (\(T=24^{\circ}\)C), low fluence irradiated B01 (\(T=-11^{\circ}\)C) and high fluence irradiated B02 (\(T=-11^{\circ}\)C).

approximately 125 \(e_{0}\) thus having negligible contribution in Eq.(1). Therefore it is expected to have no significant temperature dependence of noise in this temperature region for detectors with similar strip areas irradiated to LHC fluences.

Lead by this conclusion we may explain the increase of the noise after irradiation (Fig. 2c) by the increase of strip capacitance caused by the ionizing radiation [7] in the reactor. The measured radiation dose in SiO\({}_{2}\) for the irradiation with higher fluence is about 4 kGy.

An increase of noise at low voltages, caused by the increase of strip to back-plane capacitance may not be observed for highly irradiated detector. This is in agreement with the results of \(C-V\) measurement, where nearly no voltage dependence of capacitance at higher frequencies has been observed.

### Fluence dependence of charge collection efficiency

The charge collection efficiency measured for non-irradiated and irradiated detectors is shown in Fig. 4. Here we define the CCE of non-irradiated detector to be equal to 1. This signal corresponds roughly to 16500 electrons if the scale is derived from calibration signals. Simulation [10] of charge generation in the

280 \(\mu\)m thick detector with the \({}^{90}\)Sr source and with similar geometry predicts around 23500 electrons. The inaccurate calibration capacitor or incomplete charge collection due to short peaking time are possible explanations. For the irradiated detector the CCE was determined with the ratio of irradiated detector signal at \(U_{s}\) and the saturated signal of the non-irradiated detector. Slightly higher values of CCE can be obtained if the applied voltage is higher than \(U_{s}\).

### Evolution of signal after irradiation

It is well established that the effective dopant concentration changes after irradiation. We have checked if this behaviour is reflected in the signal evolution as well.

Therefore the time dependence of the performance of detector B02 was followed in the laboratory. The first 22 days of annealing in the laboratory had been done at room temperature (\(T=25^{\circ}\)C), after that reverse annealing was accelerated in the oven at \(T=60^{\circ}\)C. The detector was annealed without bias in steps. After each annealing step had been completed, \({}^{90}\)Sr signals at different voltages were recorded at \(T=-10^{\circ}\) and a \(C-V\) measurement was

performed. The results are shown in Fig.5. Scaling of time at \(T=60^{\circ}\)C to the equivalent time at \(T=25^{\circ}\)C was done by using the equation

\[t_{\{25^{\circ}{\rm C}\}}=t_{\{60^{\circ}{\rm C}\}}\ \exp(-E_{\rm a}/k_{B}(1/333 \,{\rm K}-1/298\,{\rm K}))\quad, \tag{2}\]

where \(E_{\rm a}=1.30\) eV is activation energy [9] and \(k_{B}\) the Boltzman constant. We may observe that \(U_{s}\) increases due to reverse annealing in a similar way as FDV determined from \(C-V\) measurements. The slope of increase in the initial (linear) part of reverse annealing is 1.58 V/day. The difference between \(U_{s}\) and FDV persists and the signal shows no degradation (Fig. 5a). From the measurements it can be concluded that no significant charge trapping levels are formed during the annealing and reverse annealing (Fig. 5b).

## 6 Conclusions

The behaviour of silicon microstrip detectors read out with fast analogue electronics was studied. The charge collection efficiency of the detector irradiated with neutrons to a fluence \(4.5\cdot 10^{13}\) 1 MeV n/cm\({}^{2}\) is \(0.91\pm 0.02\), while CCE of the detector irradiated to \(1.5\cdot 10^{14}\) 1 MeV n/cm\({}^{2}\) is \(0.82\pm 0.02\). The signal-to-noise ratio which was 18.5 before irradiation degraded to 16.5 for low fluence and 14 for high fluence. This is a consequence of signal loss and increase of noise caused by the rise of strip capacitance. The leakage current has a negligible contribution to the noise.

No additional charge loss was found during the annealing and reverse annealing of defects. The amount of overdepletion needed to run a detector remains constant during the reverse annealing.
