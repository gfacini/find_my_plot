## 1 Introduction

Identifying the decays of high-\(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) (boosted) Higgs bosons to pairs of bottom or charm quarks with high efficiency and background rejection is central to the physics programme of the ATLAS experiment [1] at the Large Hadron Collider [2]. A high-performance algorithm for tagging Higgs bosons decaying to \(b\,\bar{b}\) can play a crucial role in improving the sensitivity of searches for new resonances in Beyond the Standard Model (SM) scenarios [3] or in the precise measurements of the Higgs boson \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) spectrum [4]. Additionally, direct searches for Higgs bosons decaying to charm quarks can benefit from techniques to identify the \(c\,\bar{c}\) pair at higher momenta in a manner harmonised with the techniques used to identify the dominant \(b\,\bar{b}\) decay [5, 6, 7].

In this work, a new algorithm, GN2X, is introduced, which is trained with the goal of classifying large-radius jets based on their origin, discriminating jets from boosted Higgs boson decaying into pairs of bottom quarks, \(H(b\,\bar{b})\)-jets, and charm quarks, \(H(c\,\bar{c})\)-jets, from those originating from background processes. The backgrounds considered are multijet processes and fully hadronic top-quark decays. GN2X benefits from recent advances in flavour tagging of small-radius jets using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and transformer architectures and auxiliary training objectives [8, 9].

Higgs boson candidates are reconstructed from a large-radius (large-\(R\)) jet, capable of capturing the majority of its decay products. In GN2X, charged particle tracks within the large-\(R\) jet are then used to identify the typical signatures of \(b\)- and \(c\)-hadron decays: displaced secondary (and possibly tertiary, in the case of \(b\)-hadrons) vertices and tracks with large impact parameters. Additional GN2X variants are also explored where tracks are combined with large-\(R\) jet calorimeter constituents and subjets. Subjets are defined with a variable-radius (VR) clustering algorithm [10, 11] to resolve and identify the individual \(b\)- or \(c\)-hadrons.

GN2X supersedes the previous state-of-the-art \(H(b\,\bar{b})\) tagger [12, 13] which consists of a feed-forward network architecture combining flavour tagging discriminants (based on the DL1r tagger [14]) from up to three VR subjets associated to the large-\(R\) jet. It will be referred to as \(D_{\mathrm{Xbb}}\) throughout this note and used as a benchmark for the GN2X performance.

This note is organised as follows: Section 2 details the simulation samples used in training and evaluation of GN2X. Section 3 describes the reconstruction of large-\(R\) jets, VR subjets and charged particle tracks. Section 4 introduces the algorithm and its architecture and input features. The GN2X performance for \(H(b\,\bar{b})\) and \(H(c\,\bar{c})\) tagging is studied in Section 5. Conclusions are presented in Section 6. The ATLAS detector is described in detail in Ref. [1].

## 2 Simulated Samples

The training and evaluation of the algorithms presented in this note are performed on a per-jet basis, using jets from simulated proton-proton collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV.

As signal, jets that originate from the decay of Higgs bosons to \(b\,\bar{b}\) and to \(c\,\bar{c}\) pairs produced in association with a Z boson (\(ZH\)) are considered. The goal is to train an algorithm that can discriminate between each jet class with minimal dependence on the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\), \(\eta\) and mass distributions of the jets. Therefore, in order to ensure an appropriate sampling of the intended phase-space, the training sample corresponds to \(ZH\) production generated with a biased phase-space sampling that achieves an approximately flat distributionof jet mass. In contrast, the evaluation sample consists of SM \(ZH\) production where the Higgs boson mass is set to 125 \(\mathrm{Ge\kern-1.0ptV}\) and the jet \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) has a smoothly falling physical distribution.

Background jets arise from the decay of top quarks (with subsequent hadronic \(W\) boson decays) and from multijet production. The top quarks used in training are produced in the decay of a hypothetical \(Z^{\prime}\) boson (\(Z^{\prime}\to t\bar{t}\)) of mass 4 \(\mathrm{Te\kern-1.0ptV}\). This sample is generated such that it has an approximately flat jet \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) distribution. For evaluation purposes, top quarks from SM top-pair production with a smoothly falling jet \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\)  distribution are considered. This SM \(t\bar{t}\) sample is generated with filters on \(H_{\mathrm{T}}\)- the scalar sum of the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) of the objects in the event - in intervals of 600 \(\mathrm{Ge\kern-1.0ptV}\)-1 \(\mathrm{Te\kern-1.0ptV}\), \(1-1.5\) \(\mathrm{Te\kern-1.0ptV}\) and \(>1.5\) \(\mathrm{Te\kern-1.0ptV}\). Finally, again in order to ensure sufficient population of jets at high momenta, the multijet process simulation is performed in slices of particle-level jet \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\)[15] and in this case the same process is used to define the training and evaluation samples.

The versions of the MC event generators, tunes and parton distribution functions (PDF) used are detailed in Table 1 and Table 2, for training and evaluation samples respectively. In all cases, the decays of \(b\)- and \(c\)-hadrons are modelled by evtgen v1.6.0 [16], with the exception of the \(ZH\) evaluation samples where v1.2.0 is used.

The samples are passed through the ATLAS full detector simulation [22] based on GEANT4 [23]. The effect of multiple interactions in the same and neighbouring bunch crossings (pile-up) was included by overlaying the simulated hard-scattering event with inelastic proton-proton events generated with Pythia 8.186 using the NNPDF2.3lo PDF and the A3 set of tuned parameters [24].

The composite training sample undergoes a final kinematic resampling in jet \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\), \(\eta\) and mass to ensure identical distributions of these variables for each sample type. After applying the resampling and jet selections detailed in the following section, the resulting dataset contains 62 million jets, split between 15 million \(H(b\bar{b})\), 15 million \(H(c\bar{c})\), 10 million top and 22 million multijet jets.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{l l l l} \hline \hline

## 3 Object Definitions

The inputs to the large-\(R\) jet algorithm used to reconstruct the Higgs boson candidate are Unified Flow Objects (UFOs) [25]. UFOs merge Particle-Flow Objects [26] and Track-Calo Clusters [27], which have neutral and charged components, to achieve optimal performance across a wide kinematic range. UFO large-\(R\) jets are built using the anti-\(k_{t}\)[28] algorithm with radius parameter \(R=1.0\) implemented in fastjet[29]. Pile-up and underlying event contributions are removed via grooming with the Soft-Drop algorithm [30; 31] along with Constituent Subtraction [32] and SoftKiller [33]. For training, all jets with \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) in the range 200 GeV to 1.5 TeV, \(|\eta|<2.0\) and invariant mass in the window \(50\,\mathrm{GeV}<m_{\mathrm{J}}<300\,\mathrm{GeV}\) are considered. For evaluation, jets are considered from \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>250\) GeV to 1.5 TeV, \(|\eta|<2.0\) and \(50\,\mathrm{GeV}<m_{\mathrm{J}}<200\,\mathrm{GeV}\).

Charged particles which traverse the inner detector register hits in the sub-detectors which are reconstructed as tracks. Tracks are ghost-associated [34] to the large-\(R\) jet and are required to satisfy the track selection summarised in Table 3 and further detailed in Ref. [35].

In addition, inner detector tracks are used to form subjets using the variable-radius (VR) anti-\(k_{t}\) algorithm [37]. For VR jets, the radius \(R\) is a function of the jet \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) and a constant parameter \(\rho\), scaling as \(\rho/p_{\mathrm{T}}\). Similar to Ref. [11], a value of \(\rho=30\) GeV is used. Minimum and maximum values of the radius parameter are also defined to avoid arbitrarily small or large radii with \(R_{\mathrm{min}}=0.02\) and \(R_{\mathrm{max}}=0.4\). The VR subjets are ghost-associated to the large-\(R\) jet and are required to have \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>7\) GeV.

All large-\(R\) jets in the signal samples are required to have a ghost-associated Higgs boson at generator level, using truth information from the generator's event record. In the top quark background sample, large-\(R\) jets that are ghost-associated to any of the top quark hadronic decay products are considered. This means that large-\(R\) jets may fully or partially contain the top decay, including capturing only the hadronic \(W\) decay. No corresponding truth-labelling requirement is placed on the VR subjets.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{l l} \hline \hline
**Parameter** & **Selection** \\ \hline \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) & \(>500\) MeV \\ \(|d_{0}|\) & \(<3.5\) mm \\ \(|z_{0}\sin\theta|\) & \(<5\) mm \\ Silicon hits & \(\geq 8\) \\ Shared silicon hits & \(<2\) \\ Silicon holes & \(<3\) \\ Pixel holes & \(<2\) \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 3: Track selection requirements, where \(d_{0}\) is the transverse impact parameter (IP) of the track, \(z_{0}\) is the longitudinal IP with respect to the primary vertex and \(\theta\) is the track polar angle. Shared hits are hits used in the reconstruction of multiple tracks which have not been classified as split by the cluster-splitting neural networks [36]. A hole is a missing hit, where one is expected, on a layer between two other hits on a track.

## 4 Neural Network Architecture & Training

### Model Inputs

The base GN2X model takes as input three large-\(R\) jet variables and 20 variables associated with each track fed to the network. The large-\(R\) jet inputs encompass the jet transverse momentum, signed pseudorapidity and mass. The full set of inputs are shown in Table 4. Up to 100 tracks associated with the jet are supplied to the network, sorted by a decreasing transverse impact parameter significance, denoted as s(\(d_{0}\))1. The ordering ensures that tracks that are more likely to have originated from displaced vertices are considered, but it has a negligible role in the algorithm since the average number of tracks in the jets will be less than 100 - the median number of associated tracks for \(H(b\bar{b})\) jets is around 20.

Footnote 1: Impact parameter significances are defined as the IP divided by its corresponding uncertainty, s(\(d_{0}\)) = \(d_{0}/\sigma(d_{0}\)) and s(\(z_{0}\)) = \(z_{0}/\sigma(z_{0}\)). Track IP significances are lifetime signed according to the track’s direction with respect to the jet axis and the primary vertex [38].

Studies into architectures with heterogeneous inputs have also been performed. Two examples are presented in this note, GN2X + Subjets and GN2X + Flow. These models contain extra information in addition to the tracks fed into the model. GN2X + Subjets adds the kinematic and \(b\)-tagging information of the VR subjets, where the subjets are tagged using the GN2 tagger [9]. The GN2 tagger uses the same transformer architecture as GN2X but is trained to tag \(R=0.4\) jets containing a \(b\)- or \(c\)-hadron. GN2X + Flow uses UFO constituents which includes the use of charged and neutral calorimeter information. Charged constituents contain all the track inputs plus the extra calorimeter information, whereas for the neutral constituents only the calorimeter information is available. The extra inputs to each model are also documented in Table 4.

### Architecture

The GN2X architecture is an evolution of the GN1 architecture [8]. GN1 makes use of a Graph Neural network, whereas GN2X (and GN2) utilises a Transformer network architecture [39]. The model takes as input the sequence of tracks in a jet, with jet- and track-level inputs outlined in Section 4.1. The jet and track inputs are concatenated and the combined jet-track sequence vectors are fed into a per-track initialiser network. This network uses a Deep Sets style [40] architecture but does not contain a reduction operation over the output track representations. For the GN2X + Subjets and GN2X + Flow variants, separate initialiser networks are defined to allow separate representations to be learned for each input type. The initialiser network for each input type consist of two dense layers projecting the input representations to an embedding dimension of 192.

The track representations are fed into a Transformer Encoder where the transformer architecture utilised follows that introduced in Ref. [41]. Multiple Layer Normalisation layers [42] are used to aid in providing stability during training along with residual connections. GN2X uses 6 encoder blocks with 4 attention heads. The heterogeneous models do not use separate transformer encoders for each input type due to the significant increase in the number of parameters to do so.

The output representation of each track is then combined to form a global representation of the jet to be used for classification. This global representation is formed by a weighted sum over the track representations, where the attention weights for the sum are learned during training.

Table 4: Input features to the GN2X model. Features are separated into jet inputs, track inputs, subjet inputs and UFO constituent (flow) inputs. The subjet and flow inputs are only used in the GN2X + Subjet and GN2X + Flow models respectively.

In addition to the primary jet classification task, GN2X also has auxiliary training objectives - track origin classification and grouping tracks into vertices. Each of the tasks consist of three hidden layers containing 128, 64 and 32 neurons respectively. Further details on the auxiliary task objectives are outlined in Ref. [8]. In total GN2X contains approximately 1.5 million parameters.

### Training

GN2X is trained using a training approach similar to GN1 [8]. GN2X trainings are done on a cluster with 4 NVIDIA A100 GPUs, taking approximately 1 hour to complete an epoch of 62 million jets. The model is optimised using the Adam optimiser with a batch size of 1,000 for 40 epochs. During training, the model's primary and auxiliary tasks are weighted such that the losses were of similar magnitude, this approach is similar to that used in [8]. Moreover, the model is trained using a one-cycle learning rate policy, in which the learning rate starts at a very small value, \(10^{-7}\), and gradually increased over the first 4 epochs, after which it reached a maximum value of 0.005. Then, the learning rate is gradually decreased again and ends at \(10^{-7}\).

## 5 Results

The performance evaluation of the GN2X tagger includes an assessment of the efficiency for tagging both \(H(b\bar{b})\) and \(H(c\bar{c})\). The \(H(b\bar{b})\)-tagging efficiency is defined as the number of correctly identified \(H(b\bar{b})\) jets divided by the total number of \(H(b\bar{b})\) jets, while treating \(H(c\bar{c})\), top, and multijet (often also denoted QCD) processes as backgrounds. The \(H(c\bar{c})\) efficiency is also defined in the same manner, with \(H(b\bar{b})\) as a background. The network generates probability scores that indicate the likelihood of a given jet being identified as \(H(c\bar{c})\), \(H(b\bar{b})\), top, or multijet. When assessing the \(H(b\bar{b})\)-tagging efficiency, these probability scores are combined into a discriminant, \(D_{\rm Hbb}^{\rm GN2X}\), defined as:

\[D_{\rm Hbb}^{\rm GN2X}=\ln\left(\frac{p_{\rm Hbb}}{f_{\rm Hcc}\cdot p_{\rm Hcc }+f_{\rm top}\cdot p_{\rm top}+\left(1-f_{\rm Hcc}-f_{\rm top}\right)\cdot p_{ \rm QCD}}\right),\]

where \(f_{\rm Hcc}\) and \(f_{\rm top}\) are two free parameters that determine the relative weights of \(p_{\rm Hcc}\) and \(p_{\rm top}\) respectively to \(p_{\rm QCD}\), controlling the trade-off among \(H(c\bar{c})\), top and multijet rejections. For the following performance studies, \(f_{\rm Hcc}=0.02\) and \(f_{\rm top}=0.25\) were used, which were obtained after following an optimisation procedure to maximise the rejection for a given efficiency.

Figure 1 shows the normalised distribution of the discriminant score for \(H(b\bar{b})\), \(H(c\bar{c})\), top, and multijet jets. The double peak structure observed in the top jet distribution is a result of the difference between large-\(R\) jets the fully or only partially contain the top decay, where jets that don't contain the \(b\)-hadron from the top decay appear much more similar to the multijet background. Jets are considered tagged if they have a score higher than a given threshold value of the \(D_{\rm Hbb}^{\rm GN2X}\) discriminant, usually defined to correspond to a specific desired signal efficiency. The \(D_{\rm Xbb}\) model evaluated on the same dataset serves as a baseline. It should be noted, however, that it has not been retrained with the samples used for training GN2X.

An additional baseline considered is the case where two individual VR subjets are \(b\)- or \(c\)-tagged based on their corresponding GN2 discriminants (noted as 2 VR \(D_{b}^{\rm GN2}\) or 2 VR \(D_{c}^{\rm GN2}\) in the plots). In this case, only the two leading VR subjets associated to the large-\(R\) jet are considered, and the minimum GN2 value between the two is used to define the signal efficiency. This approach does not utilise any correlations between subjets and corresponds to tagging them independently.

### \(H(b\bar{b})\) performance

The \(H(b\bar{b})\)-tagging performance of the tagger can be quantified by its power to reject \(H(c\bar{c})\), top, and multijet backgrounds for a given \(H(b\bar{b})\)-tagging efficiency.

Figure 2 shows the background rejection as a function of the \(H(b\bar{b})\) signal efficiency in the signal efficiency range used for most physics analyses. The rejection is evaluated at a set number of points and can change rapidly at high efficiencies, which causes the observed sharp behaviour. GN2X demonstrates a significant improvement in both the top and multijet background rejection, significantly outperforming both baselines across the relevant signal efficiency range. At a 50% \(H(b\bar{b})\) signal efficiency GN2X provides a factor of 1.6 increase in the top jet rejection and a factor of 2.5 increase in the multijet rejection. GN2X also outperforms the 2-tag VR subjets baseline across all efficiencies.

The 2-tag VR subjets baseline only outperforms \(D_{\rm Xbb}\) at low \(H(b\bar{b})\) efficiencies, which shows the benefits of using the correlations between subjets. Furthermore, \(D_{\rm Xbb}\) uses up to three VR subjets which improves its efficiency for cases where the \(b\)-hadrons are not contained in the leading two subjets. In this comparison \(D_{\rm Xbb}\) was trained with DL1r discriminants [43] whereas the 2-tag VR subjets baseline benefits from the state-of-the-art GN2 tagger which has superior \(c\)-jet rejection.

The top and multijet rejection factors are also shown as a a function of the jet \(p_{\rm T}\) in Figure 3 at a 50% \(H(b\bar{b})\) efficiency where it can be seen that GN2X outperforms the baseline taggers across the entire \(p_{\rm T}\) spectrum. The top jet rejection is improved by a factor of 1.4 over the \(D_{\rm Xbb}\) tagger at 250 GeV and this increases to a factor of 2.2 increase in rejection at 1.5 TeV. The multijet rejection is improved by more

Working points are derived by by imposing a requirement on the discriminant distribution of the \(H(b\bar{b})\) jets to give the desired signal efficiency. The distribution is shown for the SM evaluation samples.

than a factor of two across the entire \(p_{\rm T}\) spectrum. In Figure 4, the \(H(b\bar{b})\) signal efficiency against jet \(p_{\rm T}\) is shown for the same 50% working point. It shows a remarkably stable efficiency as a function of the jet \(p_{\rm T}\), in contrast to what is observed with the baseline taggers. While the \(D_{\rm Xbb}\) efficiency drops from the expected 50% efficiency at 250 GeV to approximately 35% at 1.5 TeV, GN2X is able to retain an approximately constant efficiency over the entire \(p_{\rm T}\) range.

As described in Section 4 preliminary studies using heterogeneous input types have also been conducted. Figure 5 shows the \(H(b\,\bar{b})\) tagging performance of the GN2X + Subjets and GN2X + Flow architectures compared to the baseline GN2X model. The GN2X + Subjets model provides an additional 100% increase in the top rejection relative to GN2X by including complementary information on the large-\(R\) jet substructure, though it results in a reduction in the multijet rejection performance. The GN2X + Flow model however takes advantage of information on neutral jet components missing from other versions and provides more than a 50% improvement in the multijet rejection.

#### 5.1.1 Mass sculpting

To ensure that the signal and background mass shapes remain distinct after applying \(H(b\,\bar{b})\) tagging in an analysis, it is important that the tagger scores are not correlated with the large-R jet mass. If there is such a correlation, it may cause the mass distribution of the background to resemble that of the signal after tagging. This phenomenon is referred to as mass sculpting and it is undesirable when backgrounds are estimated with data-driven approaches that rely on smoothly-falling distributions, as is often the case for the multijet process. This is important for searches for Beyond the SM phenomena (e.g. [44, 45]) and also in the calibration of any \(H(b\,\bar{b})\) tagging algorithm that relies on identifying \(Z\to b\,\bar{b}\) decays in \(Z\)+jets or \(Z+\gamma\) events [13]. The top process is not considered here given that the jet mass is naturally correlated with flavour and can usually be estimated via simulation.

Figure 6 displays the normalised large-\(R\) jet mass distributions pre- and post-tagging with GN2X, for the \(H(b\,\bar{b})\) signal and the multijet background. A requirement on the discriminant corresponding to a 70% \(H(b\,\bar{b})\) efficiency has been used.

Figure 5: The top and multijet background rejection as a function of the \(H(b\,\bar{b})\) tagging efficiency for the two heterogeneous input type architectures compared to the baseline GN2X model. Statistical uncertainty bands (calculated with a binomial model) are denoted. The distribution is shown for the SM evaluation samples.

Close to the peak of the \(H(b\bar{b})\) mass distribution there is little change in the shape of the multijet distribution, as desired. However, at both high and low mass values changes in shape of the multijet distribution begin to become more significant. This is expected due to the low training statistics for jets in this kinematic regime. Extending the training distribution to higher masses is expected to reduce sculpting in the high mass region. These conclusions also hold for stricter requirements on the discriminant. Sculpting of the signal distribution is not considered a concern for most physics use cases, but does provide useful information on the population of \(H(b\bar{b})\) jets that are not tagged.

### \(H(c\bar{c})\) performance

Since GN2X outputs the likelihoods of the jets being identified as \(H(b\bar{b})\), \(H(c\bar{c})\), top and multijet, it can also be used for \(H(c\bar{c})\) tagging. The likelihoods can be combined similarly as to \(D_{\rm Hbb}^{\rm GN2X}\) in Section 5 to obtain a discriminant, \(D_{\rm Hcc}^{\rm GN2X}\), defined as:

\[D_{\rm Hcc}^{\rm GN2X}=\ln\left(\frac{p_{\rm Hcc}}{f_{Hbb}\cdot p_{\rm Hbb}+f_{ \rm top}\cdot p_{\rm top}+\left(1-f_{\rm Hbb}-f_{\rm top}\right)\cdot p_{\rm QCD }}\right),\]

where, \(f_{\rm Hbb}\) is a free parameter, similar to \(f_{\rm Hcc}\), that determines the relative rejection weight of \(p_{\rm Hbb}\) to the rest of the backgrounds. For the following performance studies, \(f_{\rm Hbb}\) = 0.3 and \(f_{\rm top}\) = 0.25 were used, which were obtained via an optimisation procedure identical to the one used for \(D_{\rm Hbb}^{\rm GN2X}\).

Figure 7 shows the background rejection as a function of the \(H(c\bar{c})\) signal efficiency in the range relevant for most physics analyses. As the previous \(D_{\rm Xbb}\) tagger was not designed for \(H(c\bar{c})\) identification, only the 2-tag VR track-jet baseline can be compared to. The minimum discriminant value of the leading two VR track-jets must pass a \(c\)-tagging requirement. For \(H(c\bar{c})\) identification, in addition to the top and

multijet background, the background from \(H(b\bar{b})\) events is non-negligible so the \(H(b\bar{b})\) rejection is also shown. At a 50% signal efficiency GN2X provides significant increases in background rejection, a factor of 3 improvement for top jet rejection, a factor of 5 improvement of the multijet rejection and a factor 6 improvement in the \(H(b\bar{b})\) rejection.

## 6 Conclusion

This note presents a novel boosted double \(b\)- and double \(c\)-tagging algorithm, GN2X, building upon a graph neural network and transformer architecture. GN2X improves upon the current ATLAS Xbb tagger by improving the top and multijet background rejections by a factor of 1.6 and 2.5 respectively at a 50% signal efficiency when evaluated on jets with \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>200\GeV\) and a mass range of \(50\GeV<m_{\mathrm{J}}<200\GeV\). GN2X can also operate as as a boosted \(H(c\bar{c})\) tagger, the first of its kind in ATLAS. As an \(H(c\bar{c})\) tagger it provides significant background rejection against not only the top and multijet backgrounds but also rejects 99% of \(H(b\bar{b})\) jets at a 50% \(H(c\bar{c})\) efficiency. Preliminary studies using heterogeneous inputs have also been conducted using extra subjet and UFO constituents information, the constituent model providing a further 50% increase in multijet rejection at a 50% \(H(b\bar{b})\) signal efficiency and the subjet model further doubles the top rejection. GN2X has been successfully implemented into the ATLAS software [46] and is ready for further studies to verify its performance on real collision data.

Figure 7: \(H(b\bar{b})\), top and multijet rejections as a function of the \(H(c\bar{c})\) efficiency for jets with \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>250\GeV\) and mass \(50\GeV<m_{\mathrm{J}}<200\GeV\). The performance of the GN2X algorithm is compared to the 2-tag VR track-jet baseline. Statistical uncertainty bands (calculated with a binomial model) are denoted. The distribution is shown for the SM evaluation samples.

## Appendix A Multijet Rejection

Figure 8: Multijet rejection split into the flavour components determined by the flavour of the VR subjets for GN2X and \(D_{\rm Xbb}\). Statistical uncertainty bands (calculated with a binomial model) are denoted. \(D_{\rm Xbb}\) has not been retrained for this comparison. The distribution is shown for the SM evaluation samples.
