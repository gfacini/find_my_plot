**Abstract**

In order to fulfil to technical and physical requirements, the photomultiplier blocks of the tile hadron calorimeter of ATLAS have to be classified in sets corresponding to different types of cells. This note presents the final setting. It is an update of what has been done in [1]. The main difference is that it takes into account the fact that some cells of the calorimeter are equipped with tiles made of PSM polystyrene and some with tiles made of BASF polystyrene. The output light for BASF tiles is about 25% higher than for PSM ones [2]. To correct a part of this effect of non-uniformity of the calorimeter, it is foreseen here to associate photomultipliers with lower quantum efficiencies to cells equipped with BASF tiles. It leads to define six sets of photomultipliers: two for barrel like super-drawers and four for extended barrel ones. The method used to define the sets is reported and two applications are presented. The first one takes into account the overall calorimeter needs and is based on 2445 photomultipliers already characterised. The second one is dedicated to the July 2001 calibration beam needs and is limited to the 285 photomultipliers that will be available at that time.

## 1 Photomultiplier needs

The general set up of the ATLAS hadron tile calorimeter is described in [1]. There are two different types of super-drawers: one for Long Barrel modules (LB), and one for Extended Barrel modules (EB). The numbers of photomultipliers needed for each sampling and for each super-drawer type are reported in Table 1. A LB module contents two super-drawers, one for each side along the beam axis. An EB module contents only one super-drawer but there are two of them along the beam axis: EBA for side A, and EBC for side C. It means that 128 ( 64 _in \(\phi\times 2\) for sides A and C_ ) super-drawers of each type are needed for ATLAS. One LB spare module and two EB spares modules (one for each side) should be added to this as well as module 0 (LB type). The total amount required is so of 10100 photomultipliers:

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|} \hline Super-Drawer & Sampling & Number of PMTs & Number of PMTs \\ \hline \multirow{3}{*}{LB} & A & 20 & \\ \cline{2-4}  & BC & 18 & 45 \\ \cline{2-4}  & D & 7 & \\ \hline \multirow{3}{*}{EB} & A & 10 & \\ \cline{2-4}  & B & 10 & \\ \cline{2-4}  & D & 6 & \\ \cline{2-4}  & C & 2 & \\ \cline{2-4}  & E & 4 & \\ \hline \end{tabular}

## 2 The different types of modules

According to the type of tiles used in the different samplings, PSM or BASF polystyrene, LB modules as well as EB ones can be classified in three types. Tables 2 and 3 show the three different types defined for LB and EB modules respectively. Module identifications and total number of modules for each type are also reported.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|} \hline LB module & Sampling & Tile type & Identification & Number \\ \hline \multirow{3}{*}{Type 0} & A & PSM & \multirow{3}{*}{00 to 14} & \multirow{3}{*}{15} \\ \cline{2-4}  & BC & PSM & \\ \cline{2-4}  & D & PSM & \\ \hline \multirow{3}{*}{Type 1} & A & PSM & \multirow{3}{*}{15 to 30} & \multirow{3}{*}{16} \\ \cline{2-4}  & BC & PSM & \\ \cline{2-4}  & D & BASF & \\ \hline \multirow{3}{*}{Type 2} & A & PSM & \multirow{3}{*}{31 to 65} & \multirow{3}{*}{35} \\ \cline{2-4}  & BC & BASF & \\ \cline{1-1} \cline{2-4}  & D & BASF & \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|} \hline LB module & Sampling & Tile type & Identification & Number \\ \hline \multirow{3}{*}{Type 0} & A & PSM & \multirow{3}{*}{15} \\ \cline{2-4}  & BC & PSM & \\ \cline{2-4}  & D & PSM & \\ \hline \multirow{3}{*}{Type 1} & A & PSM & \multirow{3}{*}{15 to 30} & \multirow{3}{*}{16} \\ \cline{2-4}  & BC & PSM & \\ \cline{1-1} \cline{2-4}  & D & BASF & \\ \hline \multirow{3}{*}{Type 2} & A & PSM & \multirow{3}{*}{31 to 65} & \multirow{3}{*}{35} \\ \cline{1-1} \cline{2-4}  & BC & BASF & \\ \cline{1-1} \cline{2-4}  & D & BASF & \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 1: numbers of photomultipliers needed.

It should be noted that two EB modules are not exactly equipped as defined in their general type classification. In module EBA15, only cell D6 is equipped with BASF tiles. In module EBA18, D sampling is equipped with BASF tiles but PSM ones were used for cell C10 (the only cell of C sampling in EB modules). Both of them have been considered as type 4. As reported in section 4, the main constraint will appear for cells with BASF tiles so it is more convenient to put arbitrarily a PSM cell in the BASF classification than the other way round.

## 3 The different sets of photomultipliers

Three sets of tubes have been foreseen in [1]. Here, as output light is higher for BASF tiles, each of these three sets is divided in two, associating lower quantum efficiency photomultipliers with cells equipped with tiles made of BASF polystyrene. Finally, six sets of photomultipliers are defined: two for barrel like super-drawers and four for extended barrel ones. The sets corresponding to each sampling of the different module types are given in Tables 4 and 5. LB modules will be filled with photomultipliers of sets 1 and 2: set 1 for PSM cells and set 2 for BASF ones. Sets 3 and 4 will match samplings A, B and D of EB modules: 3 the PSM cells and 4 the BASF ones. Samplings C and E of EB modules will correspond to set 5 and 6: set 5 for sampling E and PSM cells C10, set 6 for BASF cells C10. The total numbers of photomultipliers needed in each set are reported in Table 6. The fillings of super-drawers with the sets of photomultiplier blocks are given in Tables 7 and 8. For each hole, the associated cell type is reported as well as the photomultiplier set to be used and the corresponding module identification number.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|} \hline LB module & Sampling & PMT set \\ \hline \multirow{3}{*}{Type 0} & A & 1 \\ \cline{2-3}  & BC & 1 \\ \cline{2-3}  & D & 1 \\ \hline \multirow{3}{*}{Type 1} & A & 1 \\ \cline{2-3}  & BC & 1 \\ \cline{2-3}  & D & 2 \\ \hline \multirow{3}{*}{Type 2} & A & 1 \\ \cline{2-3}  & BC & 2 \\ \cline{2-3}  & D & 2 \\ \hline \end{tabular}

## 4 Constraints

Constraints on nominal high voltage have been defined in [1] taking into account the two different sources of high voltage available (\(HV_{in}\)) [3], the high voltage regulation [3], the optical fluctuations [4], the optics ageing [4], the special modules [5] and the higher gains needed for cells of sampling E that will be made only of scintillators. They are reported in Table 9. Photomultiplier nominal high voltages (\(HV_{nom}\)) correspond to a nominal gain of \(10^{5}\) and are measured in dedicated test benches with continuous light. The fact that some cells are filled with PSM tiles and some with BASF ones will induce additional optical fluctuations that were not foreseen. The sorting of photomultipliers with respect to their quantum efficiencies is not sufficient to compensate for this effect: see sections 6 and 7. For Cesium inter-calibration purpose, it will be so necessary to be able to decrease the gain of photomultipliers linked to BASF cells and to increase the gain of those linked to PSM cells. In general, increasing the gain is not a problem because it is already necessary for optics ageing. On the other side, decreasing the gain was not foreseen anywhere else except for standard optical fluctuations. It means that a new constraint appears: it should be possible to decrease the gain of photomultipliers associated with BASF cells of 25%, in addition to standard optical fluctuations, in order to correct the 25% of enhancement of output light with respect to PSM cells. This constraint was studied with measurements done on 1950 tubes.

## 5 Definition of sets

Super-drawer assemblies will be done in parallel with photomultiplier block qualifications. The sets of photomultipliers will so be defined with respect to what is needed in terms of super-drawer assemblies and to what is available in term of qualified photomultiplier blocks. Nevertheless, the total number of photomultipliers in each set will have to match the global calorimeter needs at the end. The following procedure is then proposed:

1. Make a list of all qualified photomultiplier blocks at the assembly time.
2. Define the number of photomultipliers in each set proportionally to global calorimeter needs, see Table 6, and check that there will be enough photomultipliers in each set for the particular assembly to be done.
3. Define the sets with respect to photomultipliers nominal high voltages and quantum efficiencies as reported in Table 11. Photomultipliers are first classified in nominal high voltage. Three cuts are defined according to needs: \(X_{cut}\) for sets 1 and 2, \(Y_{cut}\) for set 5, and \(Z_{cut}\) for set 6. The ranges of allowed values for these cuts, coming from constraints given in Table 10, are quoted in Table 12. The other constraint is to have no more photomultipliers than globally needed in set 3, 21.7% of the total amount (2192/10100, see Table 6), in the range \(\left]Y_{cut}\right.\), 698Volts]. Photomultipliers with \(HV_{nom}\leq X_{cut}\) or \(Z_{cut}<HV_{nom}\) are then classified in quantum efficiency in order to fill sets 1, 2 and 4 and to complete set 3. This last point takes advantage from the fact that there is no correlation between photomultipliers quantum efficiencies and their nominal high voltages, as shown in Figure 2.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|} \hline PMT set & \(HV_{nom}\) allowed (Volt) \\ \hline
1 & [549, 693] \\ \hline
2 & [574, 693] \\ \hline
3 & [669, 800] \\ \hline
4 & [699, 800] \\ \hline
5 & [669, 716] \\ \hline
6 & [699, 716] \\ \hline \end{tabular}

\end{table}

## 6 Overall calorimeter needs

The numbers of photomultipliers needed in each set for the overall calorimeter are reported in Table 6. Based on the available measurements of 2445 photomultipliers, the different cuts to be used have been estimated. The values obtained are reported in Table 13. They are compatible with the constraints of Table 12. The proportion of photomultipliers in the range \(|Y_{cut}\), 698Volts] is 9.1% of the total, lower than 21.7%. So, the nominal high voltage distribution matches all the constraints defined in section 5. For what concerns quantum efficiency, the global mean value is 18.9%. It is 19.4% for set 1, 17.9% for set 2, 19.2% for set 3 and 18.0% for set 4. It leads to a relative difference of 8.2% between PSM and BASF cells in Long Barrel modules and of 6.1% in Extended Barrel modules. This allows then to correct a part of the relative output light difference which is of 25%. This application is encouraging but it is not realistic because it does not take into account the fact that super-drawer assemblies and photomultiplier block qualifications will be done in parallel, skipping the first two steps of previous chapter. The application of the next section shows that almost the same results are found in a realistic case.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|} \hline Cut on \(HV_{nom}\) & Adapted to set & Allowed values (Volt) \\ \hline \(X_{cut}\) & 1 and 2 & [669, 693] \\ \hline \(Y_{cut}\) & 5 & [669, 716] \\ \hline \(Z_{cut}\) & 6 & [699, 716] \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
