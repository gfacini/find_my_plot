Introduction

This note describes the idea of using the stereo information in multilayer detectors. This study was initially motivated for the design of micromegas detectors [1, 2], one of the two detector technologies that will be used in the New Small Wheel (NSW) upgrade of the ATLAS Muon Spectrometer [3]. However, the principles presented here may be applied to any tracking detector composed of two detection planes, one rotated by a small stereo angle \(\theta\) with respect to the other. Each layer provides measurements of its local coordinates, \(\eta^{\prime}\), \(\eta^{\prime\prime}\) respectively, compared to the global coordinate system (\(\phi,\eta\)). It is demonstrated, both analytically and through Monte Carlo studies, that combining the \(\eta^{\prime}\) & \(\eta^{\prime\prime}\) information from the two stereo planes we can extract the global coordinates (\(\phi,\eta\)) measurement with a decent accuracy.

The introduction of the small stereo angle to the micromegas detectors provides a measurement of the second coordinate (\(\phi\)) and reduces significantly the number of electronic channels of the NSW system compared to a complete 2D readout configuration. This small stereo angle configuration reduces considerably the effect of the ghost hits1 especially in the worst case of the NSW inner radii hit rates (\(\sim 15\,\mathrm{kHz/cm^{2}}\)). In the outer radii of NSW the effect is negligible [4]. In addition it decreases space, power and services requirements without compromising the spatial resolution in the precision coordinate (\(\eta\)). In particular, using this configuration, the installation of radial electronic interfaces is avoided. In this note, we evaluate the performance and optimization of the micromegas detector. To achieve sufficient momentum resolution (primary objective) and to facilitate good linking for the combined muon reconstruction between the Muon Spectrometer and the Inner Detector, the NSW micromegas detector demands the spatial resolution in the precision (second) global coordinate to be better than \(100\,\mathrm{\SIUnitSymbolMicro m}\) (\(2\,\mathrm{mm}\)) per plane (for each of the four layers). These spatial resolution constraints come from the fact that the NSW should be able to reconstruct track segments with a position resolution in the bending plane better than \(50\,\mathrm{\SIUnitSymbolMicro m}\), to match the performance of the current MDT system. This will ensure that the muon spectrometer has a momentum resolution better than \(10\%\) at \(p_{T}\sim 1\,\mathrm{TeV}\).

In the next sections we analyze two different small angle stereo configurations, an asymmetric and a symmetric case. In the symmetric case, both local coordinates \(\eta^{\prime}\)& \(\eta^{\prime\prime}\) are rotated with respect to the global coordinate \(\eta\) while in the asymmetric case one of the local coordinates is kept parallel to the local coordinate \(\eta\). The asymmetric case will be analyzed first, to point out its weaknesses and the more optimal symmetric case will follow.

## 2 Asymmetric Case

Let us assume that we have two micromegas detector layers where the one is rotated by an angle \(\theta=3^{\mathrm{o}}\) with respect to the other. We consider two coordinate systems (\(\phi,\eta\)) and (\(\phi^{\prime},\eta^{\prime}\)) that define the two micromegas detectors, as shown in Figure 1.

An arbitrary point \(A\) in these two Cartesian coordinate systems can be transformed by the known orthogonal rotation matrix

\[\left(\begin{array}{cc}\cos\theta&-\sin\theta\\ \sin\theta&\cos\theta\end{array}\right)\]

Thus, the point \(A\) can be described in the two coordinate systems as follows\[\begin{array}{l}\eta^{\prime}=\eta\cos\theta-\phi\sin\theta\\ \phi^{\prime}=\eta\sin\theta+\phi\cos\theta\end{array}\Bigg{\}}\quad\Rightarrow \quad\begin{array}{l}\eta=\eta^{\prime}\cos\theta+\phi^{\prime}\sin\theta\\ \phi=-\eta^{\prime}\sin\theta+\phi^{\prime}\cos\theta\end{array}\]

From the two micromegas detectors we measure two independent coordinates, \((\eta,\eta^{\prime})\). Using the equation of the transformation \(\eta^{\prime}=\eta\cos\theta-\phi\sin\theta\), we can derive the coordinate \(\phi\)

\[\phi=\frac{\eta\cos\theta-\eta^{\prime}}{\sin\theta}\qquad\phi^{\prime}=\frac{ \eta-\eta^{\prime}\cos\theta}{\sin\theta}, \tag{1}\]

and therefore the corresponding error of this coordinate will be

\[\sigma_{\phi}=\sigma_{\eta}\frac{\sqrt{1+\cos^{2}\theta}}{\sin\theta},\qquad \mbox{assuming}\quad\sigma_{\eta}=\sigma^{\prime}_{\eta} \tag{2}\]

In Figure 2, the ratio of errors \(\sigma_{\phi}/\sigma_{\eta}\) is plotted as a function of the rotation angle \(\theta\). For a rotation angle of \(\theta=3^{\rm o}\), by using Eq (2) the error in \(\phi\) will be \(\sigma_{\phi}=27\sigma_{\eta}\), for example in the case of a measurement error in \(\eta\)-coordinate of the order of \(\sigma_{\eta}=100\) um (which is the resolution spatial specification of micromegas detectors for the NSW upgrade [3]) it gives \(\sigma_{\phi}=2.7\) mm.

Assume now that we have the measurement of \(\eta^{\prime}\). We would like to transform this back to the \((\phi,\eta)\) coordinate system by using the transformation \(\eta=\eta^{\prime}\cos\theta+\phi^{\prime}\sin\theta\). Let's call this coordinate \(\eta_{\rm new}(\eta^{\prime})\), so it corresponds to the coordinate \(\eta\) that is derived from \(\eta^{\prime}\)

\[\eta_{\rm new}(\eta^{\prime})=\underbrace{\eta^{\prime}\cos\theta}_{x}+ \underbrace{\phi^{\prime}\sin\theta}_{y} \tag{3}\]

where \(x=\eta^{\prime}\cos\theta\) and \(y=\phi^{\prime}\sin\theta=\eta-\eta^{\prime}\cos\theta\). The covariance matrix (assuming \(\sigma_{\eta}=\sigma_{\eta^{\prime}}\)) and the correlation coefficient \(\rho\) are

Figure 1: Two coordinate systems rotated by a \(\theta\) angle. An arbitrary point \(A\) can be described by \((\phi,\eta)\) or \((\phi^{\prime},\eta^{\prime})\).

\[\mbox{Cov}=\sigma_{\eta}^{2}\left|\begin{array}{cc}\cos^{2}\theta&-\cos^{2} \theta\\ -\cos^{2}\theta&1+\cos^{2}\theta\end{array}\right|,\qquad\rho=\frac{\mbox{Cov}(x, y)}{\sqrt{\mbox{Cov}(x,x)\mbox{Cov}(y,y)}}=-\frac{\cos\theta}{\sqrt{1+\cos^{2} \theta}}\]

The errors of the two above terms \(x,\,y\) will be given by

\[\sigma_{x}=\sigma_{\eta^{\prime}}\cos\theta=100\,\mbox{$\upmu$m}\times\cos 3^{ \circ}=99.9\,\mbox{$\upmu$m},\quad\sigma_{y}=\sigma_{\phi^{\prime}}\sin\theta =2.7\,\mbox{mm}\times\sin 3^{\circ}=141\,\mbox{$\upmu$m} \tag{4}\]

The two errors \(\sigma_{x}=\sigma_{\eta^{\prime}}\cos\theta\) and \(\sigma_{y}=\sigma_{\phi^{\prime}}\sin\theta\) are shown in Figure 3 where they represent the projections of \(\sigma_{\eta^{\prime}}\) and \(\sigma_{\phi^{\prime}}\) along \(\eta\) direction, respectively.

These two terms \(x,\,y\) are correlated since we have used \(\eta\) and \(\eta^{\prime}\) to derive the coordinates \(\phi\) and \(\phi^{\prime}\). Therefore, the error of the \(\eta_{\rm new}(\eta^{\prime})\) will be given by the known formula

\[\sigma_{\eta_{\rm new}(\eta^{\prime})}^{2}=\sigma_{x}^{2}+\sigma_{y}^{2}+2 \,\mbox{Cov}(x,y)\]

where the covariance element is \(\mbox{Cov}(x,y)=\mbox{Cov}(y,x)=\mbox{Cov}(\eta^{\prime}\cos\theta,\eta\cos \theta-\eta^{\prime})=\sigma_{\eta^{\prime}}\cos^{2}\theta=b\sigma_{x}^{2}=b^ {\prime}\sigma_{y}^{2}\), and \(b,\,\,b^{\prime}\) are the slopes of the average \(y\) vs \(x\) or the average \(x\) vs \(y\) correlation, if they exist. The correlation coefficient \(\rho\) is related to \(b,\,\,b^{\prime}\) by the known formulas \(\rho=\mbox{Cov}(x,y)/\sigma_{x}\sigma_{y}=b\sigma_{x}/\sigma_{y}=b^{\prime} \sigma_{y}/\sigma_{x}\). Thus for \(y\) vs \(x\), we get

\[\sigma_{\eta_{\rm new}(\eta^{\prime})}^{2}=\sigma_{x}^{2}+\sigma_{y}^{2}+2b \sigma_{x}^{2}=\sigma_{y}^{2}+(1+2b)\sigma_{x}^{2} \tag{5}\]A similar and more rigorous mathematical analysis of the covariance formalism for stereo detectors can be found in an article by V. Karimaki [5].

At this point it will be beneficial to discuss few points about the asymmetric case. We measure \(\eta\) and \(\eta^{\prime}\) while the second coordinates \(\phi\) and \(\phi^{\prime}\) are functions of \(\eta\) and \(\eta^{\prime}\) measurements, i.e. \(\phi=\phi(\eta,\eta^{\prime}),\ \phi^{\prime}=\phi^{\prime}(\eta,\eta^{\prime})\) with the expressions indicated in Eq. (1).

From the expression of \(\eta_{\rm new}\) as given by Eq. (3) and with the help of the expression of \(\phi^{\prime}\) given above we conclude that the slopes are \(b=-1\) (independent of \(\theta\)) and \(b^{\prime}=-\cos^{2}\theta/(1+\cos^{2}\theta)\). Furthermore, we come to the result that \(\eta_{\rm new}=\eta\) which is a trivial consequence but it deserves some considerations: we measure \(\eta\) and \(\eta^{\prime}\), both with resolution of \(100\,\upmu\)m but we do not measure \(\phi\) and \(\phi^{\prime}\). Since the stereo angle is small (\(\theta=3^{\rm o}\)), someone could naively expect to measure the precision coordinate with a resolution of \(\sigma_{\eta}\sim 70\,\upmu\)m (\(100\,\upmu/\sqrt{2}\) from two independent measurements) and the second coordinate with \(\sigma_{\phi}\sim 70\,\upmu\)m\(/\sin 3^{\rm o}=1.34\,\)mm. Instead, analyzing the problem properly, we rather find that the error in the second coordinate is \(\sigma_{\phi}\sim 141\,\upmu\)m\(/\sin\,(3^{\rm o})=2.7\,\)mm and the error along the precision coordinate is still \(100\,\upmu\)m, not better than the single measurement along \(\eta\), i.e. the measurement along a slightly tilted direction does not improve the resolution on the precision coordinate.

In order to study the error \(\sigma_{\eta_{\rm new}(\eta^{\prime})}\) we have generated several Monte Carlo points in the coordinate system \((\phi,\eta)\). Then we have rotated them into the \((\phi^{\prime},\eta^{\prime})\) coordinate system. In the second step, the \(\eta,\ \eta^{\prime}\) are smeared with a \(\sigma_{\eta}=\sigma_{\eta^{\prime}}=100\,\upmu\)m as shown in Figure 4(a,b). In Figure 4(c,d) the calculated \(\phi\) coordinate with an error of \(2.7\,\)mm is presented. In Figure 4(g,h) the parameters of the \(y,\ x\) distributions, \(\sigma_{y}=140.9\,\upmu\)m and \(\sigma_{x}=100.1\,\upmu\)m are extracted from the gaussian fits. In Figure 4(i) the distribution of \(\eta_{\rm new}(\eta^{\prime})\) with an extracted error of \(\sigma_{\eta_{\rm new}(\eta^{\prime})}=99.3\,\upmu\)m is shown.

By using this toy Monte Carlo we derive from the correlation of \(x,\ y\) the slope \(b=-1\) by performing a 2D fit, as shown in Figure 4(e) (which confirms the analytical calculation of the slope,\(\sigma_{\eta^{\prime}}^{2}=-1\)). Similarly, from the correlation of \(y,\ x\) the slope \(b^{\prime}=-0.5\) as shown in Figure 4(f). The error \(\sigma_{\eta_{\rm new}(\eta^{\prime})}^{2}\) will be

\[\sigma_{\eta_{\rm new}(\eta^{\prime})}^{2}=\sqrt{\sigma_{x}^{2}+\sigma_{y}^{2}+ 2{\rm Cov}(x,y)}=\sigma_{\eta^{\prime}}\sqrt{\cos^{2}\theta+(1+\cos^{2}\theta )-2\cos^{2}\theta}=100\;\upmu\mbox{m}\]

by using Eq. (5). In this calculation we assume \(\sigma_{\eta}=\sigma_{\eta^{\prime}}\).

## 3 Symmetric Case

Let us assume the symmetric case where two coordinate systems \((\phi^{\prime},\eta^{\prime})\) and \((\phi^{\prime\prime},\eta^{\prime\prime})\) have been rotated with respect to the \((\phi,\eta)\) by an angle \(\theta\) and \(-\theta\) (the relative angle between the two coordinate systems \((\phi^{\prime},\eta^{\prime})\) and \((\phi^{\prime\prime},\eta^{\prime\prime})\) is \(2\theta\)), respectively, as shown in the following Figure 5.

In this case the relevant transformations that describe an arbitrary point \(A\) are given by the following equations

\[\left.\begin{array}{l}\eta^{\prime}=\eta\cos\theta-\phi\sin\theta\\ \phi^{\prime}=\eta\sin\theta+\phi\cos\theta\end{array}\right\}\Rightarrow \eta=\eta^{\prime}\cos\theta+\phi^{\prime}\sin\theta\]

and

\[\left.\begin{array}{l}\eta^{\prime\prime}=\eta\cos\theta+\phi\sin\theta\\ \phi^{\prime\prime}=-\eta\sin\theta+\phi\cos\theta\end{array}\right\}\Rightarrow \eta=\eta^{\prime\prime}\cos\theta-\phi^{\prime\prime}\sin\theta\]

By adding the two above expressions of \(\eta^{\prime}\) and \(\eta^{\prime\prime}\) we get

\[\eta^{\prime}+\eta^{\prime\prime}=2\eta\cos\theta\quad\Rightarrow\eta=\frac{ \eta^{\prime}+\eta^{\prime\prime}}{2\cos\theta} \tag{6}\]

This formula is valid under the assumption that all three coordinate systems share the same center of rotation. If there is a displacement \(a\) along the axis \(\eta\) between the centers of coordinate systems \((\phi,\eta)\) and \((\phi^{\prime},\eta^{\prime})\), \((\phi^{\prime\prime},\eta^{\prime\prime})\) (assuming that these two coordinate systems share a common center of rotation), Eq. (6) will simply become

\[\eta=\frac{\eta^{\prime}+\eta^{\prime\prime}}{2\cos\theta}+a\]

The error in \(\eta\) as expressed in Eq. (6) will be

\[\sigma_{\eta}=\frac{\sigma_{\eta^{\prime}}}{\sqrt{2}\cos\theta},\qquad\mbox{ assuming}\quad\sigma_{\eta^{\prime}}=\sigma_{\eta^{\prime\prime}} \tag{7}\]

In the case of \(\theta=1.5^{\rm o}\) (where the two systems \((\phi^{\prime},\eta^{\prime})\) and \((\phi^{\prime\prime},\eta^{\prime\prime})\) are rotated by \(3^{\rm o}\) with respect to each other) the combined error of the precision coordinate \(\eta\) will be \(\sigma_{\eta}=71\;\upmu\mbox{m}\) (assuming a \(\sigma_{\eta^{\prime}}\) of \(100\;\upmu\mbox{m}\)) as we could have achieved by combining two micromegas chambers oriented in a parallel configuration (all strips from both micromegas chambers are parallel to each other).

The \(\phi\) coordinate can be extracted from the expression \(\eta^{\prime}=\eta\cos\theta-\phi\sin\theta\) or

\[\phi=\frac{\eta\cos\theta-\eta^{\prime}}{\sin\theta} \tag{8}\]

By combining Eq. (6) with Eq. (8) we get \[\phi=\frac{\eta^{\prime\prime}-\eta^{\prime}}{2\sin\theta} \tag{9}\]

and the corresponding error on the second coordinate \(\phi\) will be \[\sigma_{\phi}=\frac{\sigma_{\eta^{\prime}}}{\sqrt{2}\sin\theta} \tag{10}\]

for example by using \(\theta=1.5^{\mathrm{o}}\) and \(\sigma^{\prime}_{\eta}=100\,\upmu\mathrm{m}\) it implies \(\sigma_{\phi}=2.7\,\mathrm{mm}\).

Also, we can express the coordinates \(\phi^{\prime}\) and \(\phi^{\prime\prime}\) as follows

\[\phi^{\prime}=\frac{\phi+\eta^{\prime}\sin\theta}{\cos\theta}=\frac{\eta^{ \prime\prime}-\eta^{\prime}\cos(2\theta)}{\sin(2\theta)},\qquad\phi^{\prime \prime}=\frac{\phi-\eta^{\prime\prime}\sin\theta}{\cos\theta}=\frac{\eta^{ \prime\prime}\cos(2\theta)-\eta^{\prime}}{\sin(2\theta)},\]

and the corresponding errors will be

\[\sigma_{\phi^{\prime}}=\sigma_{\phi^{\prime\prime}}=\frac{1}{\sin 2(\theta)} \sqrt{\sigma_{\eta^{\prime\prime}}^{2}+\sigma_{\eta^{\prime}}^{2}\cos^{2}(2 \theta)}=2.7\,\mathrm{mm}\quad\mathrm{or}\quad\sigma_{\phi^{\prime}}=\sigma_ {\phi^{\prime\prime}}=\sigma_{\eta^{\prime}}\frac{\sqrt{1+\cos^{2}(2\theta)}} {\sin(2\theta)}=2.7\,\mathrm{mm}\]

where the variables \(\eta^{\prime}\) and \(\eta^{\prime\prime}\) are independent, \(\mathrm{Cov}(\eta^{\prime},\eta^{\prime\prime})=0\), (coherence is canceled out in the conditions of symmetry and antisymmetry between \(\eta^{\prime}\) and \(\eta^{\prime\prime}\)).

Figure 6 shows \(\sigma_{\eta}/\sigma_{\eta^{\prime}}\) and \(\sigma_{\phi}/\sigma_{\eta^{\prime}}\) as a function of \(\theta\). Using toy Monte Carlo we verified that the error of the precision coordinate \(\eta\) is \(\sigma_{\eta}=71\,\upmu\mathrm{m}\) as shown in Figure 7(e). The error of the \(\phi\) coordinate was verified to be \(\sigma_{\phi}=2.7\,\mathrm{mm}\) as shown on Figure 7(f).

We would like to emphasize that the symmetric case can be obtained by using a rotation by \(-\theta/2\) of the asymmetric configuration discussed in section 2 and what appears to be a suboptimal configuration is now turned into a convenient configuration where expected resolution improvements are obtained. The precision coordinate resolution is improved by the expected factor of \(\sqrt{2}\) for two layers, while obtaining the necessary resolution on the second coordinate as well.

It is worth to describe and analyze the case where the two titled planes \((\phi^{\prime},\eta^{\prime})\) and \((\phi^{\prime\prime},\eta^{\prime\prime})\) of Figure 5 are separated by a known distance \(\Delta z\). Let us also assume that a known track of polar angle \(\Theta\) and azimuthal angle \(\Phi\) transverses the two planes. The precision coordinate \(\eta\) (Eq. (6)) and the second coordinate \(\phi\) (Eq. (9)) will be modified and given by the following relations

\[\eta=\frac{\eta^{\prime}+\eta^{\prime\prime}}{2\cos\theta}-\Delta z\frac{\tan \Theta\sin\Phi}{2}-\Delta z\frac{\tan\Theta\cos\Phi}{2}\tan\theta,\qquad\phi= \frac{\eta^{\prime\prime}-\eta^{\prime}}{2\sin\theta}-\Delta z\frac{\tan \Theta\sin\Phi}{2\tan\theta}-\Delta z\frac{\tan\Theta\cos\Phi}{2}\]

Here the coordinates \(\eta\) and \(\phi\) are defined on the plane of \(\eta^{\prime}\), \(\phi^{\prime}\), the value \(\Theta=0\) corresponds to vanishing values of \(\eta^{\prime}\), \(\phi^{\prime}\), \(\eta^{\prime\prime}\), and \(\phi^{\prime\prime}\), and the \(\phi\) axis defines \(\Phi=0\).

The total uncertainty in \(\eta\) and \(\phi\) is given by

\[\sigma_{\eta}=\frac{\sigma_{\eta^{\prime}}}{\sqrt{2}\cos\theta}\oplus\sigma_{ \Delta z}\frac{\tan\Theta\sin\Phi+\tan\Theta\cos\Phi\tan\theta}{2}\oplus\sigma \left(\tan\Theta\sin\Phi+\tan\Theta\cos\Phi\tan\theta\right)\frac{\Delta z}{2}\]

\[\sigma_{\phi}=\frac{\sigma_{\eta^{\prime}}}{\sqrt{2}\sin\theta}\oplus\sigma_{ \Delta z}\left(\frac{\tan\Theta\sin\Phi}{2\tan\theta}+\frac{\tan\Theta\cos \Phi}{2}\right)\oplus\sigma\left(\frac{\tan\Theta\sin\Phi}{\tan\theta}+\tan \Theta\cos\Phi\right)\frac{\Delta z}{2}\]

From these expressions, it can be derived that the contributions to the uncertainties related to the separation between the measuring planes are negligible if

\[\sigma_{\Delta z}\ll\sqrt{2}\frac{\sigma_{\eta^{\prime}}}{\tan\Theta\cos \theta}\qquad\qquad\frac{\sigma_{\Theta}}{\cos^{2}\Theta}\ll\sqrt{2}\frac{ \sigma_{\eta^{\prime}}}{\Delta z\cos\theta}\qquad\qquad\sigma_{\Phi}\tan \Theta\ll\sqrt{2}\frac{\sigma_{\eta^{\prime}}}{\Delta z\cos\theta}\]The last two conditions are met if the incidence angle of the track to the plane (\(z\), \(\eta\)) is known with an accuracy better than what can be obtained from the values of \(\eta^{\prime}\), \(\eta^{\prime\prime}\) measured by our detector alone. In the case of the micromegas detector, \(\Delta z=10\,\mathrm{mm}\), \(\sqrt{2}\sigma_{\eta^{\prime}}/\mathrm{tan}\,\Theta\cos\theta=390\,\mathrm{\upmu m}\), \(\sqrt{2}\sigma_{\eta^{\prime}}/\Delta z\cos\theta=0.014\) for an average track angle \(\Theta=10^{\mathrm{o}}\) and expected resolution less than \(\sigma_{\Theta}=1\,\mathrm{mrad}\); while the error in the plane resolution is expected to be better \(\sigma_{\Delta z}=50\,\mathrm{\upmu m}\). This requirement is met when the values of the angles are constrained by additional measurements with larger separation along the \(z\)-axis (large lever arm).

### Geometric Interpretation

The effect of the precision coordinate resolution improvement by a factor \(\sqrt{2}\), when two layers are considered while obtaining at the same time the necessary resolution on the second coordinate, can be analyzed and understood by using some basic geometrical ideas. In this section, we consider some naive geometric interpretations of this effect.

Let us define two strips of equal width \(l\) that are rotated by a relative angle \(2\theta\) as shown in Figure 8. Due to the symmetry of the two strips the parallelogram ABCD has all equal sides so it's equilateral quadrilateral or rhombus. The ellipsis that corresponds to the overlap of the two strips has two semi-major axes that we call \(a\) and \(b\).

A tangent AB through a point \(\mathrm{A}^{\prime}(\phi_{1},\eta_{1})\) is described in the Cartesian coordinate system \((\phi,\eta)\) by the line equation \[\frac{\phi\phi_{1}}{a^{2}}+\frac{\eta\eta_{1}}{b^{2}}=1\]

Taking \(\phi=0\) or \(\eta_{1}=0\) we get (AO) \(=b^{2}/\eta_{1}\) or (OB) \(=a^{2}/\phi_{1}\). From the triangle \(\stackrel{{\Delta}}{{AB}}\) we get

\[\sin\theta=\frac{\mbox{(AO)}}{\mbox{(AB)}}=\frac{b^{2}}{\eta_{1}\mbox{(AB)}} \quad\Rightarrow\eta_{1}=\frac{b^{2}}{\mbox{(AB)}\sin\theta},\quad\cos\theta= \frac{\mbox{(BO)}}{\mbox{(AB)}}=\frac{a^{2}}{\phi_{1}\mbox{(AB)}}\quad \Rightarrow\phi_{1}=\frac{a^{2}}{\mbox{(AB)}\cos\theta} \tag{11}\]

Also, from the triangle \(\stackrel{{\Delta}}{{\mbox{ABB}}^{\prime}}\) we can extract the relation \(\sin(2\theta)=l/\mbox{(AB)}\) and by inserting it to Eq. (11) we have

\[\eta_{1}=\frac{2b^{2}\cos\theta}{l},\qquad\qquad\phi_{1}=\frac{2a^{2}\sin \theta}{l} \tag{12}\]

From triangle \(\stackrel{{\Delta}}{{\mbox{BA}}^{\prime}}\)\(\stackrel{{\Delta}}{{\mbox{O}}^{\prime\prime}}\) we can write

\[\tan\theta=\frac{\mbox{(A}^{\prime}\mbox{O}^{\prime})}{\mbox{(O}^{\prime} \mbox{B)}}=\frac{\eta_{1}}{\mbox{(OB)}-\phi_{1}}=\frac{\eta_{1}\phi_{1}}{a^{2 }-\phi_{1}^{2}}\quad\stackrel{{\eqref{eq:12}}}{{\Rightarrow}} \tan\theta=\frac{4b^{2}\cos\theta\sin\theta}{l^{2}-4a^{2}\sin^{2}\theta}\]

\[\Rightarrow l^{2}=4(a^{2}\sin^{2}\theta+b^{2}\cos\theta) \tag{13}\]

From triangle \(\stackrel{{\Delta}}{{\mbox{OO}}_{1}}\)\(\stackrel{{\Delta}}{{\mbox{O}}_{2}}\) we get a relation between \(a\) and \(b\), namely, \(\tan\theta=b/a\;\Rightarrow b=a\tan\theta\). Thus, combining this relation with Eq. (13) we extract the expressions of \(a\) and \(b\) as a function of \(l\) and \(\theta\)

Figure 8: The overlap of two symmetric strips with equal width \(l\) corresponds to an ellipsis of semi-major axes \(a\) and \(b\).

\[2a=\frac{l}{\sqrt{2}\sin\theta},\qquad\qquad 2b=\frac{l}{\sqrt{2}\cos\theta} \tag{14}\]

which are identical to the relations of Eq. (7) and Eq. (10) by assuming that \(l=\sigma_{\eta^{\prime}}\) and \(\sigma_{\eta}=2b\), \(\sigma_{\phi}=2a\).

Therefore, the above result geometrically can be interpreted in a simple way where the ellipsis of the 2D measurement is bound by, and tangent to, the two pairs of parallel lines defining the \(\pm 1\) sigma errors of the two separate measurements.

Another way of explaining the geometrical interpretation goes as follows: Consider the measurement along \(\eta^{\prime}\) and assume no offset (see Figure 5). The \(\chi^{2}\) associated with this measurement is related to the distance \(d^{\prime}\) between the point \(A(\phi,\eta)\) and the line \(\eta=\phi\tan\theta\). The unit vector along this line is expressed as \((\cos\theta,\sin\theta)\). The distance is given by \(d^{\prime}=|\phi\sin\theta-\eta\sin\theta|\) leading to a \(\chi^{2}\) for this measurement given by

\[\chi^{2}=\frac{|\phi\sin\theta-\eta\sin\theta|^{2}}{\sigma_{\eta^{\prime}}^{2}}\]

Then, if we add a new measurement along \(\eta^{\prime\prime}\) and taking into account the distance \(d^{\prime\prime}\) from the line \(\eta=\phi\tan(-\theta)\), we get a new \(\chi^{2}\) that is expressed as

\[\chi^{2}=\frac{|\phi\sin\theta-\eta\sin\theta|^{2}}{\sigma_{\eta^{\prime}}^{2} }+\frac{|\phi\sin\theta+\eta\sin\theta|^{2}}{\sigma_{\eta^{\prime\prime}}^{2}}\]

Assuming equal errors \(\sigma_{\eta^{\prime}}=\sigma_{\eta^{{}^{\prime}}}\) for the two measurements, the \(\chi^{2}\) is reduced to

\[\chi^{2}=2\frac{\phi^{2}\sin^{2}\theta+\eta^{2}\cos^{2}\theta}{\sigma_{\eta^{ \prime}}^{2}}=\frac{\phi^{2}}{\left(\sigma_{\eta^{{}^{\prime}}}/\sqrt{2}\sin \theta\right)^{2}}+\frac{\eta^{2}}{\left(\sigma_{\eta^{{}^{\prime}}}/\sqrt{2} \cos\theta\right)^{2}}\]

For \(\chi^{2}=1\) we get the equation of an ellipsis oriented along the \(\phi\) and \(\eta\) axes with semi-major axes

\[\frac{\sigma_{\eta^{{}^{\prime}}}}{\sqrt{2}\sin\theta}\qquad\mbox{and}\qquad \frac{\sigma_{\eta^{{}^{\prime}}}}{\sqrt{2}\cos\theta}\]

respectively for \(\phi\) and \(\eta\); notice that this results agrees with the pure geometrical result of Eqs. (14). It is worth mentioning that the correlation term has vanished.

## Conclusions

The second coordinate measurement in a system of two rotated (stereo) detector layers is described along with the corresponding error analysis. It is evident that the symmetric case of two rotated detector layers provides an optimal measurement of the the precision coordinate with a resolution improvement by a factor of \(\sqrt{2}\) expected when combining two parallel precision planes. It also provides a second orthogonal coordinate measurement at a moderate level of resolution depending on the angle of rotation. This technique has been taken into consideration during the design phase of the micromegas chambers for the upgrade of the ATLAS experiment in the NSW project [3].
