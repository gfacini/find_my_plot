The barrel e.m. presampler will be composed of 64 identical azimuthal sectors each of them consisting of 8 modules of different types. This requires 8 different mother boards (MBs) which are described in details in reference [1]. The functions of the mother boards are : 1) to collect the electronic signals from the presampler, 2) to distribute the calibration pulses, 3) to distribute the high voltage. They are 5-layered printed circuits (35 \(\mu\)m, class 4), with an overall thickness of 2.3\({}^{+0}_{-0.2}\) mm, (each of the 5 FR4 layers being about 0.4 mm thick). The trace width (in the signal and injection layers) is 320 \(\pm\) 30 \(\mu\)m in order to obtain an impedance close to 50 \(\Omega\). These signal and injection layers are separated by ground planes in order to reduce cross talks. In this report only the MB of type 3 (see figure 1) will be considered since this is the only one which was fully tested yet. It is 169 mm wide and 32l mm long. Except the geometrical aspects (sizes, length of the traces, etc...), the designs of all the MBs are essentially alike.

### Calibration

A test pulse system is implemented on the MBs to be used as diagnostic and calibration means. For this purpose, accurate surface mounted resistors (0.1 %), with temperature coefficient 25 ppm/\({}^{\circ}\)C between -55\({}^{\circ}\)C and +125\({}^{\circ}\)C, are used. The value of some of these resistors has been measured at room temperature and at liquid nitrogen temperature (77 K) by means of a Hewlett Packard 4285A precision LCR meter working in that case at a frequency of 80 kHz. The results are reported in table 1.

The schematic diagram of the injection system on the mother boards is shown on figure 2. The 2 k\(\Omega\) resistors are soldered as close as possible to the detection cell connection points in order to reduce parasitic capacitances.

## 2 Tests and results of the MB of type 3

The tests are achieved by injecting in the MB test pulses from a generator. The output signals are analysed with a numeric oscilloscope, (see figure 3). Capacitors of 377 pF were

time equal to 370 ns, is injected in the MB (curve # 1). The output signal (curve # 2) has an amplitude of 664 mV and a rise time (10-90%) of 37 ns. Then, in order to measure the cross talk between the calibration cable and the output cables, the exponential pulse is injected in a cable loaded with a 50 \(\Omega\) resistor soldered on the MB. This new cable and the output signal cable are parallel to each other over a length of 2.2 m, their separation being 0 cm (curve # 3) and 5 cm (curves # 4 and 5, in this latter case the MB was not connected to the Faraday cage with the ground wire). Curve # 6 shows the response when no pulse is injected. Curves # 3, 4, 5 and 6 are drawn with the same scale (5 mV/div). Table 2 gives the resulting cross talks for each curve. The calibration cross talk is obtained by dividing the maximum amplitude when a test pulse is injected in the cable loaded by the 50 \(\Omega\) resistor (see figure 10) by the maximum amplitude when the same test pulse is sent through the mother board injection system. This measurement corresponds to the calibration signal distortion which will be really observed in the ATLAS detector. The cable-to-cable cross talk takes into account the fact that only a part of the initial current (16 channel/mother board to provide ; R\({}_{adaptation}\)/R\({}_{injection}\) = 51 \(\Omega\)/2 k\(\Omega\)) is sent in the detection cell. The more realistic case, (curve # 4), leads to a calibration cross talk of about 0.2%, and a cable-to-cable cross talk of 3.10\({}^{-6}\). Table 3 shows the cross talks measured as a function of the separation between both cables when they are parallel to each other over a length of 1.8 m, and when the injected pulse has a leading edge rise time (10-90%) of 3 ns. The effect is of the order of one or several thousandths of the output signal, corresponding to a cable-to-cable cross talk of about a few ppm.

## 4 Tests at CERN

A presampler module of type 3 and its corresponding MB have been tested at CERN at room temperature. Figure 12 shows the average output signal when exponential pulses, provided

by the standard calibration board with an amplitude of 381 mV, are injected in the MB, (the shaping time of the CR-RC\({}^{2}\) filter was equal to 13 ns). No significant pre-pulse (\(>0.3\) %) due to the cross talk between cables was observed. The standard deviation of the noise was equal to 3 mV, leading to an equivalent current input of 62 nA, in good agreement with what was expected.
