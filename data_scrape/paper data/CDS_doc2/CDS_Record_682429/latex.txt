## 1 Introduction.

The basic idea of this note is to explore the possibility of extending the \(\eta\)-coverage of the ATLAS forward calorimetry, possibly up to \(\eta=7.6\), using a gas calorimeter able to operate reliably in an area of very high radiation doses and particle densities. From the physics point of view, such an extension of the \(\eta\)-coverage cannot be justified for \(H\ \rightarrow\ ZZ\ \rightarrow\ \ell\ell\nu\nu\) nor for SUSY squark and gluino searches, as was shown in previous studies. For the search for \(A\ \rightarrow\ \tau\tau\) decays, however, it may be possible to improve the mass resolution of reconstructed \(\tau\tau\) pairs by extending the \(\eta\)-coverage of the ATLAS forward calorimetry beyond \(\eta=5\).

The process under consideration here is:

\[pp\longrightarrow A+X \tag{1}\]

\[A\longrightarrow\tau^{+}\tau^{-}\]

\[\tau^{+}\longrightarrow e^{+}\nu_{e}\bar{\nu}_{\tau},\qquad\tau^{-} \longrightarrow\mu^{-}\bar{\nu_{\mu}}\nu_{\tau}\]

Hadronic decays of one of the \(\tau\)-leptons could also be considered in this context.

## 2 Event simulation

To simulate this process, PYTHIA 5.7 was used with the following settings:

* The pseudoscalar Higgs boson A was produced through standard gluon-gluon fusion and in association with a \(b\bar{b}\) pair. The latter mechanism is the dominant one for MSSM pseudoscalar Higgs bosons for large values of \(\tan\beta\).
* \(\tan\beta\ =\ 10\), \(m_{A}\ =\ 150\) GeV and \(m_{t}\ =\ 170\) GeV.
* Initial and final state radiation were switched on.

## 3 Missing \(p_{T}\) and Higgs mass resolutions.

To study the missing \(p_{T}\) and Higgs mass resolutions as a function of the luminosity \(L\), pile-up events were added to the signal events from process (1).

The \(A\) mass resolution for the chosen set of selection criteria is directly related to the \(P_{x}^{miss}\) resolution, which is the spread of the distribution of the difference between \(P_{x}^{\nu}\), the sum of all neutrino momenta in process (1) and \(P_{x}^{miss}\) measured in the ATLAS detector. Let us call this difference \(\Delta P_{x}^{miss}\). Figure 4 shows the distribution of the total measured hadronic energy in projection, \(P_{x}\), for the different \(\eta\) regions of the calorimeter, whereas Fig. 5a shows the distribution of \(\Delta P_{x}^{miss}\). Both figures are plotted for a luminosity of \(L~{}=~{}10^{34}~{}cm^{-2}~{}s^{-1}\) and for different \(\eta\)-coverages. Figure 4 shows that the spread of \(P_{x}\) decreases as the energy is collected at larger and larger rapidities. In particular, for \(|\eta|~{}<~{}3\), this spread is 37 GeV and decreases to 23 GeV for \(3<|\eta|~{}<5\), and to 14 GeV for \(5<|\eta|~{}<~{}7.6\). This last \(\eta\)-range corresponds to the coverage which could be achieved (in an idealised world) by a very forward calorimeter situated just in front of the low-\(\beta\) quadrupoles at a distance of about 18 m from the interaction point. The particle energy spread in this \(\eta\)-range is of the same magnitude (at design luminosity) as the expected spread of \(\Delta P_{x}^{miss}\) for \(|\eta|~{}<~{}5\) shown in Fig. 5a. It is therefore not surprising that one observes a clear reduction of this spread if the calorimeter coverage is extended to \(|\eta|~{}<~{}7.6\). The improvement in missing \(p_{T}\) resolution is therefore quite substantial, from 15 GeV to 8 GeV (in projection) at high luminosity. As shown in Fig. 5b for the case of low luminosity, \(L~{}=~{}10^{33}~{}cm^{-2}~{}s^{-1}\), the gain in missing \(p_{T}\) resolution is much less and scales in fact more or less as \(\sqrt{L}\).

The corresponding impact of this improvement of the missing \(p_{T}\) resolution on the \(\tau\tau\) or \(A\) mass resolution can be seen in Fig. 6a (for \(L~{}=~{}10^{34}~{}cm^{-2}~{}s^{-1}\)) and in Fig. 6b (for \(L~{}=~{}10^{33}~{}cm^{-2}~{}s^{-1}\)). The improvement in mass resolution is about a factor of two at high luminosity and a factor of 1.5 at low luminosity. For a totally ideal calorimeter, the \(A\) mass resolution at high luminosity with a calorimeter coverage over \(|\eta|~{}<~{}7.6\) is expected to be almost the same as that at low luminosity with a calorimeter coverage over \(|\eta|~{}<~{}5\). Figure 7 shows the dependence at low and high luminosity of \(\sigma(m_{A})\) for \(m_{A}=150\) GeV upon the overall \(\eta\)-coverage of the calorimeter.

The significance of a signal from \(A~{}\rightarrow~{}\tau\tau\) decays above the backgrounds, which are discussed elsewhere [7], is proportional to the square root of the product of the mass resolution and the luminosity. The significance is also proportional to a factor K, which reflects the fraction of badly reconstructed neutrinos. Figure 8 shows the gain in significance expected as a function of the calorimeter \(\eta\)-coverage at low and high luminosity. The gain is normalised to unity for a coverage over \(|\eta|~{}<~{}5\) at low luminosity. Whereas the significance improves marginally at low luminosity, the gain at high luminosity could be as high as a factor of 1.5 for \(|\eta|~{}<~{}7.6\) compared to \(|\eta|~{}<~{}5\).

## 4 Conclusion.

The simple simulation results shown in this note are encouraging enough to pursue this study within the more realistic environment of full simulation of a very forward calorimeterfor ATLAS. The results form this full simulation are expected to be worse than those of the idealised simulation, due to the finite size of hadronic showers and to the complexity of the very forward region (LAr calorimeter cryostat, vacuum pumps for beam pipe etc).
