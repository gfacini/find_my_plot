Using the cosmic ray stand at Laboratori Nazionali di Frascati, the drift time response of a MDT-BML chamber is studied, in different positions with respect to the incoming gas flow, during an induced variation of the gas mixture. The chamber under test is equipped with two different gas distribution systems, fully parallel and serial-parallel. Large differences are observed between the drift times measured at different locations with respect to the gas flow during the transient. At the Atlas-like flow of one gas volume exchange per day, the differences reduce to a negligible amount as soon as stationary conditions are reached.

## Introduction

The drift time behaviour of the MDT chambers has been studied with respect to the stability of the gas mixture. The study was motivated by a result obtained with the 2002 beam test at CERN, showing quite different behaviour between the three tubes connected in series to the gas distribution system. Two gas connection systems are actually used with the ATLAS-MDT chambers: a fully parallel system, in which each tube is individually connected to the input gas bar and to the output gas bar, and a serial-parallel system in which three tubes are connected in series, the first being connected to the input gas bar and the third to the output gas bar. In the case of the serial-parallel gas connection, differences from 5 ns up to 10 ns in the maximum drift time were observed between the first tube and the third tube of the series [1]. This was a large effect and raised concern about the use of the serial-parallel gas distribution system, chosen for many of the ATLAS MDT chambers because of its lower complexity and lower cost with respect to the fully parallel system.

In order to further investigate this effect, after the end of the 2002 test beam period, a study was started at the Frascati cosmic ray station [2]. From this investigation it appeared clear that the tubes connected in series behave indeed in a significantly different way when changes occur in the gas mixture. Therefore, systematic measurements were taken during the variation of the gas mixture for a few days, until the mixture in the tubes became stabilized.

The measurements made and the results obtained in the transient period and in the final stationary status are illustrated in the following sections.

### Experimental set-up

The cosmic ray stand at the Laboratori Nazionali di Frascati of the Istituto Nazionale di Fisica Nucleare is shown in Fig. 1. The chamber under test (BML 15) was equipped with two different gas distribution systems, serial-parallel and fully parallel, on multi-layer one and two, respectively. As presented in Fig 2, the following nomenclature is adopted for multi-layer one: tube 1, 2 and 3 for the input, middle and output, respectively. Three different coincidence triggers were used, as shown in Fig. 2. Trigger1 is located near the inlet distribution gas bar, trigger 2 approximately in the middle of the chamber and trigger 3 near the outlet distribution gas bar. In order to avoid water contamination, only copper pipes were used for the distribution of the gas.

### Data sample

The gas flow on the chamber was kept stable for several days with the following parameters:

* Ar 47.0 nl/h (fraction 93.5%)
* CO\({}_{2}\) 3.25 nl/h (fraction 6.5%)

In these conditions the drift time showed negligible differences between the different kind of tubes on multi-layer one and two. The chamber could therefore be considered in stable conditions.

To produce a transient, the gas flow parameters were changed to:

* Ar 47.0 nl/h (fraction 92%)\(\bullet\) CO\({}_{2}\) 4.1 nl/h (fraction 8%)

The total gas flow was practically unchanged while the CO\({}_{2}\) fraction was increased by 1.5%. An increase of the CO\({}_{2}\) fraction produces a reduction of the drift velocity and an increase of the drift time.

A set of data of 2.7 million triggers (run number 74) was collected in 115 hours.

### Data analysis

The data sample was first divided in three data sub-samples according to the trigger 1, 2 or 3. For each tube of the chamber and for each kind of trigger the t0 was determined by fitting the corresponding time spectrum with the same procedure adopted in reference [1]. It has to be remarked that, due to the propagation of the electrical signal along the wire, different t0's correspond to different triggers (i.e. positions along the tube) for the same tube. The t0 is then subtracted to all the time measurements according to tube and trigger.

The three data sub-samples were divided into temporal "slices" of 10000 consecutive triggers corresponding to approximately 5.5 hours of data taking. Time distributions were calculated for each temporal slice for the three triggers and for the four kind of tubes with respect to the gas flow (one distribution for the fully parallel and three for the serial-parallel gas distribution system). Due to the limited statistics, the distributions were added for the same category of tube and trigger. In total, for each temporal slice, 12 histograms were constructed. From the fit performed on these histograms, the maximum drift time t\({}_{\rm{drift}}\) = t\({}_{\rm{max}}\) - t0 was calculated.

### Results

The results of the measurements on multi-layer two (fully parallel gas distribution system) are shown in Fig. 3. The increase of the drift time, due to the increase of the CO2 fraction, is visible and starts first in the trigger 1 data, followed by trigger 2 and trigger 3 data. Figure 3 shows very clearly that, during the transient, the drift time in the same tube is different along the tube. This indicates that the gas mixture changes in time according to the gas flow and the diffusion is quite limited. With these gas flow conditions, one volume of gas is changed in about 50 hours. After 60 - 80 hours the three measurements are consistent, the differences being within 2-3 ns, and the effect due to the transient has practically disappeared.

The results from multi-layer one (serial-parallel gas distribution system) are shown in Figs. 4, 5 and 6. It has to be remarked that the gas flow on each tube of this multi-layer is three times larger with respect to multi-layer one, since three tubes are connected in series and the total volume of the gas is changed in the same amount of time for the two multi-layers. Fig. 4 shows the behaviour of input tubes. With respect to multi-layer one, fully parallel, the change in drift time happens three times faster, in agreement with the factor three in the gas flow. Stationary conditions are reached in about 30 hours. Fig. 5 shows the measurements performed on the middle tubes. Due to the serial gas connection, middle tubes are characterized by a gas flow which goes from trigger 3 to trigger 1. This is clearly observed since trigger 3 rises first and trigger 1 rises last. The figure looks very much like the input tube one, once a delay of about 20 hours is considered: this is the time it takes to the new gas to reach middle tubes. Fig. 6 shows the situation of output tubes, which behave like input tubes with a delay of about 40 hours. It must be noted that after about 80 hours all the tubes of multi-layer one are in stable conditions and all the systematic effects due to the transient have disappeared.

Another interesting comparison is shown in Figs. 7 and 8, where the drift times for the two positions at the end of one tube and at the beginning of the next tube in the series are plotted.

The agreement between the measurements in those positions shows that there is no effect due to contamination entering the tube by penetrating through the gas jumper material.

## Conclusions

During the transient produced by a change in the gas mixture, large differences are observed in the drift time of the MDT tubes if different locations with respect to the gas flow are considered. All the results are consistent with the flow of the gas.

When stationary conditions are reached, no systematic effects are observed in the values of the drift time in different locations with respect to the flow of the gas. In particular, the inlet, middle and outlet tubes in the serial-parallel gas distribution system are characterized by negligible differences in the drift time.

This study shows that when tubes 1, 2 and 3 in the gas series are compared, the results are meaningful only if the stability of the mixture is checked.
