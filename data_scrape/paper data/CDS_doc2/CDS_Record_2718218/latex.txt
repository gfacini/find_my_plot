# A \(W/z\)-boson tagger using Track-CaloCluster jets with ATLAS

The ATLAS Collaboration

The performance of a \(W/Z\)-boson tagger optimised for a diboson resonance search in semi-leptonic final states is presented. ATLAS has developed a particle-flow algorithm dedicated to jets with high transverse momentum, known as the Track-CaloCluster (TCC) algorithm, that improves the resolution of jet substructure variables. The \(W/Z\) taggers are optimised using TCC jets and the performance is measured in \(pp\)-collisions data at a centre-of-mass energy of 13  collected with the ATLAS detector corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 80 fb\({}^{-1}\). The measured signal efficiency and the background rejection in data agree with Monte Carlo simulation within the evaluated uncertainty.

## 1 Introduction

\(W/Z\)-boson tagging based on large-radius (large-\(R\)) jets [1; 2; 3] is widely used in searches for new physics processes beyond the Standard Model (SM) at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), such as diboson resonances [4; 5; 6], subsequent decays of vector-like quarks [7; 8; 9], as well as measurements of SM processes [10; 11]. ATLAS has developed a particle-flow algorithm, Track-CaloCluster (TCC) [12], dedicated to jets with very high transverse momentum (\(p_{\mathrm{T}}\)), that significantly improves the resolution of the energy correlation function ratio \(D_{2}\)[13; 14]. \(W/Z\) taggers using TCC objects have been optimised in some searches, to maximise the sensitivities to their target signals [4; 5].

This note presents studies on the optimisation and performance of a \(W/Z\) tagger using large-\(R\) jets reconstructed from TCC objects. This \(W/Z\) tagger is optimised in the context of a search for heavy diboson resonances in semi-leptonic final states (\(WW/WZ/ZZ\to\ell\nu qq/\ell\ell qq/\nu\nu qq\)) [5]. In the search, the requirement of high-\(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) charged leptons and/or large missing transverse momentum (\(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\)) highly suppresses the multijet events and the SM background is dominated by \(W\to\ell\nu\) and \(Z\to\ell\ell\nu\nu\) productions in association with jets (denoted as \(W\)+jets and \(Z\)+jets, or collectively called \(V\)+jets) and \(t\bar{t}\) production, which have relatively small cross sections. Hence, the tagger was optimised to keep a high signal efficiency, especially in the high \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) regime, instead of focussing on a high background rejection. Details of the tagger optimisation can be found in Section 3. The per-jet efficiencies of the optimised \(W\) tagger are measured in \(pp\)-collisions data collected by the ATLAS detector at a centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV in years 2015-17. Descriptions about the ATLAS detector and the trigger and the data acquisition system are found elsewhere [15; 16; 17]. To measure the signal efficiency, large-\(R\) jets containing \(W\to qq^{\prime}\) (\(W\)-jet1) from top-quark decays in a \(t\bar{t}\) sample are employed, similar to the procedure described in more details in Ref. [1]. The efficiency of the \(W/Z\) tagger for top-quark-induced jets excluding \(W\)-jets (top-jet) is also measured with the same data sample. The \(V\)+jets background contains jets originating from single quarks or gluons (bkg-jet). In order to estimate the rejection factor of the \(W\) tagger for bkg-jets in data, multijet and \(\gamma\)+jets selections are employed, similar to the procedure in Ref. [1] as well. The search does not only use events where the jets are tagged as \(W/Z\)-boson candidate but also defines regions where the jet fails the boson tagging requirement to improve the sensitivity and to estimate the amount of the SM background. The correlation between events in these regions is taken into account in the measurements in this note so that it can be propagated to the search analysis. Some technical details of the efficiency and rejection measurements are summarised in Section 4, systematic uncertainties are discussed in Section 5 and results in Section 6.

Footnote 1: Large-\(R\) jet containing \(Z\to q\bar{q}\) is denoted as \(Z\)-jet as well.

## 2 Data and Monte Carlo simulated samples

Data were collected in three categories to study the signal efficiency and background rejection. For the signal, \(W\)-jet candidates are obtained from a sample of \(t\bar{t}\) candidate events in which one top quark decays in the muon channel (\(t\to b\mu\nu\)) and the other decays hadronically (\(t\to bqq^{\prime}\)). The efficiency to select the top-jet background is also studied with this dataset. Bkg-jets are studied using data samples enriched in multijet events and \(\gamma\)+jets events to cover different \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) ranges. The data were collected in the \(pp\) collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV during normal operations of the detector in years 2015-17 and correspond to an integrated luminosity of 80 fb\({}^{-1}\). Only data collected while all relevant detector

originating from light quarks or gluons, while the latter is aimed primarily at rejecting high-\(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) gluons, which radiate much more than \(W/Z\) bosons at this energy scale and thus have a higher track multiplicity. The radiation multiplicity of light quarks is less distinct from \(W/Z\) bosons at this energy scale and thus light quarks are not dramatically impacted by the cut on \(n_{\mathrm{trk}}\).

In contrast, the search for diboson resonances in the semi-leptonic final states [5] has a much smaller contribution from multijet events, and is instead dominated by \(V\)+jets and \(t\bar{t}\) processes. These background processes have much smaller cross sections, and thus the tagger was instead optimised to maintain high signal efficiency. Furthermore, these backgrounds are dominated by quark jets, while multijet events include a large number of high-\(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) gluon jets. This change in background composition resulted in minimal benefits when applying any selection on \(n_{\mathrm{trk}}\), and thus the optimised \(W/Z\) tagger for the semi-leptonic final states makes use of only jet mass and \(D_{2}\).

A mass window and upper cut on \(D_{2}\) are scanned simultaneously in each \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) bin from 200 GeV to 2.5 TeV, after applying the event selection criteria of the search, as detailed in Ref. [5] except for the boson tagging requirement. To optimise a \(W\) tagger and a \(Z\) tagger, \(W^{\prime}\to ZW\to\nu\nu qq^{\prime}\) and \(W^{\prime}\to WZ\to\ell\nu q\bar{q}\) samples are used, respectively. The tagging criteria are chosen such that they optimise the sensitivity \(z\) in each \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) bin. Here, \(z\) is defined as:

\[z=\sqrt{2\left(n\ln\left[\frac{n(b+\sigma^{2})}{b^{2}+n\sigma^{2}}\right]- \frac{b^{2}}{\sigma^{2}}\ln\left[1+\frac{\sigma^{2}(n-b)}{b(b+\sigma^{2})} \right]\right)}\]

where \(n=s+b\); \(s\) and \(b\) are the number of signal and the SM background events estimated by MC simulations assuming an integrated luminosity of 140 fb\({}^{-1}\), and \(\sigma\) is the statistical uncertainty of the simulated events [38]. The formula is motivated by a Poisson likelihood function and it is more reliable than using \(s/\sqrt{b}\) motivated by a Gaussian likelihood in case of small \(b\).

The optimal thresholds for the \(m_{J}\) and \(D_{2}\) cuts in the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) bins are fitted by analytical functions (\(\sqrt{\left(a/p_{\mathrm{T}}-b\right)^{2}+\left(cp_{\mathrm{T}}+d\right)^{2}}\) for mass and a third order polynomial for \(D_{2}\))2. The efficiencies of the optimised \(W\) and \(Z\) taggers for \(W\)-jet and \(Z\)-jet signals as well as the rejection factor to bkg-jets are shown in Figure 1. Compared with the \(W/Z\) tagger used in early run-2 ATLAS analyses (cut-based 50% working point using purely calorimeter-based jets in Ref. [1]), the rejection factor is almost the same, while the signal efficiency is increased by up-to 20% at the highest \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) because of the improved \(D_{2}\) resolution. Pile-up dependency on the signal efficiencies is studied by simulated events and found to be negligible.

Footnote 2: The optimised thresholds are found in Ref. [5].

## 4 Methods to estimate signal efficiency and background estimation

Overall strategies to measure the signal efficiency and background rejection are almost the same as those described in Ref. [1]. Definitions of leptons, photons, small-\(R\) jets, track jets, and \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\), as well as the event selections, are similar to the reference. The following three points are changed in this note, besides the updates on object calibrations.

* TCC jets are used here instead of jets solely reconstructed from calorimeter objects and the \(W/Z\) tagger is optimised using TCC jets, described in Section 3;* The definition of the truth label used to classify jets as signal or background is updated, as described in Section 4.1;
* Events failing the tagger requirements are categorised into further regions and the tagging efficiency is compared between data and simulation for the different regions taking into account the correlations between them, as discussed in Sections 4.2.2 and 4.4.2.

### Definition of truth labels

Truth level information in MC simulation is used to label a jet as \(W\)-jet, \(Z\)-jet, top-jet or bkg-jet in order to study the efficiencies of the tagger for these different categories of jets and to calibrate them in data. A definition of this "truth label" of large-\(R\) jet is introduced in this section. For the labelling definition, truth large-\(R\) jets that are geometrically matched to reconstructed jets within \(\Delta R<0.75\), are used. The truth large-\(R\) jets are reconstructed from stable particles using the anti-\(k_{t}\) algorithm with \(R=1.0\) and the same trimming parameters as for the TCC jets.

A truth-jet is labelled as "inclusive top-jet", if the truth large-\(R\) jet is matched to a top quark after final-state radiation with \(\Delta R<0.75\). If in addition, the number of ghost-associated \(B\) hadrons is greater than zero and the jet mass of the truth large-\(R\) jet is larger than 140 GeV, the truth large-\(R\) jet and its matched reconstructed jet are both labelled as "fully-contained top-jet". Using this definition, about 50% (95%) of the large-\(R\) jets containing all three partons from the top-quark decay are labelled as fully-contained top-jets at \(p_{\mathrm{T}}=400\) GeV (2 TeV).

If a \(W\) (\(Z\)) boson from the MC "truth" record is matched to the truth large-\(R\) jet within \(\Delta R<0.75\) and \(m_{J}\) of the truth large-\(R\) jet is in the range of 50-100 GeV (60-110 GeV), the jet is labelled as "\(W\)-jet" ("Z-jet"). Some events can be labelled as containing both a \(W\)-jet and an inclusive top-jet. To suppress the contamination from the \(b\)-quark from the top-quark decay, the number of \(B\) hadrons ghost-associated with the truth large-\(R\) jet is additionally required to be zero for \(W\)-jet. Using this definition, about 75%

HVT \(W^{\prime}\) and \(Z\)+jets simulated events are used to estimate efficiencies and rejections, respectively.

(\(\sim 100\%\)) of the large-\(R\) jets containing two partons from \(W\)/\(Z\)-boson decay are labelled as \(W\)-\(Z\)-jet at \(p_{\mathrm{T}}=200\)\(\mathrm{Ge\kern-1.0ptV}\) (\(600\)\(\mathrm{Ge\kern-1.0ptV}\)).

In summary, this note creates four categories of jet labels. Fully-contained top-jets and \(W\)-jets are orthogonal, while inclusive top-jets can overlap with both of the previous two labels. Any jet that is labelled as either an inclusive or fully-contained top-jet and is not labelled as a \(W\)-jet is also referred to as a top-jet, while any jet that is not labelled as any of the previous definitions is referred to as a bkg-jet.

### Efficiency measurement for \(W\)-jet signals

#### 4.2.1 Event selection

The following cuts are applied to select \(t\bar{t}\) candidate events:

* exactly one muon with \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>30\)\(\mathrm{Ge\kern-1.0ptV}\) and no additional electrons or muons with \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>25\)\(\mathrm{Ge\kern-1.0ptV}\);
* \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}>20\)\(\mathrm{Ge\kern-1.0ptV}\) and \((E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}+m_{\mathrm{T}}^{W})>60\)\(\mathrm{Ge\kern-1.0ptV}\)3;

Footnote 3: \(m_{\mathrm{T}}^{W}=\sqrt{2p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\ell}E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}(1- \cos\Delta\phi)}\) is calculated from the transverse momentum of the lepton, \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\ell}\), and \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\) in the event. \(\Delta\phi\) is the azimuthal angle between the lepton momentum and the \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\) direction.
* at least one small-\(R\) jet with \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>25\)\(\mathrm{Ge\kern-1.0ptV}\) and \(\Delta R(\mu,j)<1.5\);
* at least one \(b\)-tagged \(R=0.2\) track jet;
* at least one large-\(R\) jet.

The highest-\(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) large-\(R\) jet is used to study the \(W\)-tagger efficiency. A \(b\)-tagged track jet is required to have angular separation \(\Delta R(b,J)>1.0\) from the large-\(R\) jet. Because the geometrical separation of the daughter \(b\)-quark and the top parton decreases with increasing \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\), this requirement limits the efficiency of the \(W\)-boson selection at high \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\), which limits the kinematic reach to approximately \(600\)\(\mathrm{Ge\kern-1.0ptV}\). These requirements result in relatively pure sample of \(W\) bosons as shown in Figure 2. The disagreement between the peak positions in MC simulation and data observed near \(m_{W}\) is attributed to a mismodelling of the jet mass scale. No in-situ calibration of jet energy and jet mass, which would improve the data/MC agreement and reduce uncertainties, is applied to TCC jets for simplicity. In this note, more conservative uncertainties are used which cover these discrepancies, as described in Section 5. The \(t\bar{t}\) and single-top MC samples are divided into three subsamples based on the jet labels outlined in Section 4.1 to highlight the fraction of events in each sample of interest:

* \(t\bar{t}\) (W) and single top (W): events with large-\(R\) jet labelled as \(W\)-jet;
* \(t\bar{t}\) (top): events with large-\(R\) jet labelled as fully-contained top-jet;
* \(t\bar{t}\) (other) and single top (other): the other events not satisfying the above requirements.

#### 4.2.2 Signal efficiency extraction

Due to the relatively high purity of the sample of \(W\) bosons that result from the selection described in Section 4.2.1, it is possible to measure the signal efficiency in data. This measurement can be used to calibrate the signal efficiency in simulated events and to estimate the systematic uncertainty on a jet-by-jet efficiency scale factor [39; 40]. The \(W\) scale factors are then also applied to \(Z\)-jets.

The search for diboson resonances in semi-leptonic final states uses events with large-\(R\) jet not only tagged as \(W\)-jet or \(Z\)-jet but also failing the tagger requirements to define control regions for the estimation of the SM background. The events are categorised into four regions:

* Region 0: \(m_{J}\) passed, \(D_{2}\) passed;
* Region 1: \(m_{J}\) passed, \(D_{2}\) failed;
* Region 2: \(m_{J}\) failed, \(D_{2}\) passed;
* Region 3: \(m_{J}\) failed, \(D_{2}\) failed.

The numbers of signal-like events in data in each region is obtained from a \(\chi^{2}\) template fit of signal and background distributions predicted by MC simulations to the data to correct for mismodelling of the cross section of the various processes contributing to the phase space of interest. The labelling of signal events follows Section 4.2.1 and is based on MC simulations of \(t\bar{t}\) and single-top-quark events. To increase the stability of the fit, background templates whose shapes are similar are merged. This procedure results in two components, one signal (\(t\bar{t}(W)\) and single top(\(W\))) template and one background (\(t\bar{t}\)(top)+\(t\bar{t}\)(other)+single top(other)+non-\(t\bar{t}\)) template. The normalisation of the signal template in each region is allowed to float freely in the fit (i.e. four different normalisation factors for signal are used in the fit). For the background template in all regions, one common normalisation factor is assigned and determined in the fit, while the efficiency of the tagger on background events is fixed to the value in MC

simulation. The simultaneous fit to four regions is performed using distributions of \(m_{J}\) of the leading large-\(R\) jet, thus separating signal and background events, as demonstrated in Figure 3. Normalizations of signal distributions in the given region \(i\), \(N_{\text{fitted signal},i}\) are extracted from the fit. Therefore, the tagger efficiency for signal events in data in region \(i\) can be extracted as

\[\epsilon_{\text{data},i}=\frac{N_{\text{fitted signal},i}}{\sum_{i=0}^{3}N_{ \text{fitted signal},i}}.\]

This can be compared in each region to the tagger efficiency in MC simulation:

\[\epsilon_{\text{MC},i}=\frac{N_{\text{signal},i}}{\sum_{i=0}^{3}N_{\text{ signal},i}}.\]

The signal efficiency and the fraction of events in each region \(i\) are measured in data and obtained in simulations in each large-\(R\) jet \(p_{\text{T}}\) bin. When systematic uncertainties are estimated, correlations between the four regions are taken into account automatically with this prescription.

### Efficiency measurement for top-jet background

In order to estimate the efficiency of the \(W\) tagger for top-jet background, a sample of events using the same selection criteria as described in Section 4.2 but requiring \(\Delta R(b,J)<1.0\) is employed. With this selection, \(t\bar{t}\) (W) and single top (W) components are suppressed. About 95% of events in the \(t\bar{t}\) sample are labelled as containing top-jets and used to build the signal template for the fit. The background template is formed by non-\(t\bar{t}\) components.

### Measurement of the bkg-jet rejection

#### 4.4.1 Event selection

To select \(\gamma\)+jets events, the following selection criteria are applied:

Figure 3: An example of the post-fit jet mass distributions in (a) region 0 + 2 (\(D_{2}\) passed) and (b) region 1 + 3 (\(D_{2}\) failed) in events to select \(W\)-jet candidates in \(200<p_{\text{T}}<250\) GeV bin. Only statistical uncertainties are shown.

* exactly one isolated photon with \(E_{\mathrm{T}}>\)155 GeV and \(|\eta|<2.5\);
* at least one large-\(R\) jet with \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>200\) GeV and \(\Delta\phi(J,\gamma)>\pi/2\).

To select samples enriched in multijet events, events are required to have at least one large-\(R\) jet with \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>450\) GeV. The multijet sample covers the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) range up to 2.5 TeV.

In both selections, the normalisation of the simulated multijet and \(\gamma\)+jets predictions is derived directly from data after the preselection, taking into account the small contribution from \(V\)+jets and \(t\bar{t}\) events. Figure 4 shows a comparison of the distributions of the leading large-\(R\) jet mass in the inclusive multijet and \(\gamma\)+jets selections.

#### 4.4.2 Background rejection extraction

In a similar manner to the measurement of the signal efficiency in Section 4.2, the background rejection \(1/\epsilon_{\mathrm{bkg}}\) is measured. This measurement is performed in both the multijet and \(\gamma\)+jets topologies as a two-dimensional function of \((p_{\mathrm{T}},\ln(m_{J}/p_{\mathrm{T}}))\) of the leading large-\(R\) jet to suppress the uncertainty coming from the correlation between the jet and mass.

The approach in this measurement is simpler than the chi-square fit approach used in Section 4.2 due to the purity of these samples. In particular, after subtracting the signal contamination from data and performing the normalisation of the multijet and \(\gamma\)+jets samples in the inclusive selection, the background efficiency is calculated directly as the fraction of events that satisfy the full set of tagging criteria in data and in MC simulation. The data-to-MC scale factors are derived independently for each of the four regions.

## 5 Systematic uncertainties

A number of sources of systematic uncertainty enter into the evaluation of the modelling of data by the MC simulation. These uncertainties derive both from theoretical assumptions within the MC predictions and from the reconstruction and calibration of the detector response to the physics objects and therefore affect the three topologies to varying degrees. Systematic uncertainties are propagated to the signal efficiency measurement by repeating the fit for varied templates that correspond to each systematic uncertainty source and comparing the extracted efficiency for the varied and nominal templates.

The uncertainties originating from the measurement of leptons, photons, small-\(R\) jets, and the \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\) soft term are found to be negligible. The uncertainties on the large-\(R\) jet \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) scale is evaluated by comparing the large-\(R\) jets to those formed from inner-detector tracks only [30]. The method relies on the assumption that TCC-jet \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) is independent from track measurements. This assumption is not strictly true since TCC uses inner-detector tracks in its algorithm, but a possible bias is expected to be small since the total energy of TCC jets is determined by calorimeter measurements. The uncertainty on the track reconstruction efficiency is taken into account. In addition, the difference between TCC-jet \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) and calorimeter-jet \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) is considered as a non-closure uncertainty. The estimated uncertainties on the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) scale have an impact of 2-6% on the signal efficiency in region 0 (\(m_{J}\) passed, \(D_{2}\) passed). Due to the correlation between \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) and \(m_{J}\) variables, the impact on the background rejection is larger than on the signal efficiency even though a two-dimensional binning of \((p_{\mathrm{T}},\ln(m_{J}/p_{\mathrm{T}}))\) is used. The impact of the large-\(R\) jet \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) scale on the background rejection is up to 15% in the high-\(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) region in region 0, and the dominant source of the uncertainty for \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>500\GeV\). The uncertainty due to the application of \(R=0.2\) track jet based flavour tagging [39, 40] is 10% on the signal efficiency at \(p_{\mathrm{T}}=600\GeV\) in region 0 and about 50% in region 3 (\(m_{J}\) failed, \(D_{2}\) failed). A large flavour tagging uncertainty is observed for events in specific kinematic regions. The same trends are also found on the efficiencies for top-jet background in region 0 and region 1 (\(m_{J}\) passed, \(D_{2}\) failed). These uncertainties are expected to be reduced for the newer more precise variable-radius track jet flavour tagging now commonly used, but which were not available at the time in which these results were produced.

For \(t\bar{t}\) events, the uncertainty due to initial-state-radiation (ISR) is estimated by simultaneous variations of the \(h_{\mathrm{damp}}\) parameter [41], the renormalisation and factorisation scales, and choosing the Var3c up/down variants of the A14 tune as described in Ref. [42]. The impact of final-state-radiation (FSR) is evaluated with weights corresponding to the effect of varying the renormalisation scale for final-state parton-shower emissions by a factor two up or down. To estimate the uncertainty from the choice of the parton shower algorithm, the difference between the nominal Powheg+Pythia and the alternative Powheg+Herwig samples is considered. To assess the uncertainty on the matching of NLO matrix-elements and parton shower, the nominal Powheg sample is compared to MadGraph5_aMC@NLO. The \(t\bar{t}\) modelling uncertainty is the dominant source of the uncertainty on the signal efficiency and it is about 20% at \(p_{\mathrm{T}}=200\GeV\) and about 14% at \(p_{\mathrm{T}}=600\GeV\) in region 0.

The signal efficiency is extracted in data for jets with \(p_{\mathrm{T}}<600\GeV\). In the search, the same scale factor at \(p_{\mathrm{T}}=600\GeV\) is applied at higher-\(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) with an additional extrapolation uncertainty derived using MC simulation with different detector conditions. Resulting uncertainty is up-to 5% on the signal efficiency in region 0. Small differences of the estimated high-\(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) extrapolation uncertainties between \(W\)-jets and \(Z\)-jets are taken into account as the additional uncertainty for \(Z\)-jets.

For multijet and \(\gamma\)+jets events, the nominal Pythia and Sherpa MC samples are compared to the alternative Sherpa and Pythia samples, respectively. It is a dominant source of the uncertainty in \(\gamma\)+jets measurementand the impact on the background rejection is about 5% in region 0. The impact in the multijet measurement is much smaller than large-\(R\) jet \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) scale uncertainty discussed above.

## 6 Results

Figure 5 shows the signal efficiency of the \(W\)-tagger for \(W\)-jets in data and MC simulation in each region. Generally, the data agree with MC prediction within the uncertainty. In region 0 (\(m_{J}\) passed, \(D_{2}\) passed), data-to-MC ratio (scale factor) is about 80-90% depending on \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\).

It is known that the \(W/Z\)-tagging efficiency depends on the polarisation of \(W/Z\) bosons. Although the polarisation of \(W\) boson in the SM \(t\bar{t}\) events used in this measurement might be different from the one in the hypothetical new physics events in the search, the impact on the scale factor is not considered because the \(W\)-boson polarisation is well described by the \(t\bar{t}\) MC simulation [43].

Figure 6 shows the extracted efficiencies for the top-jets. Data agree very well with MC prediction in all regions. The large uncertainties found in region 3 (\(m_{J}\) failed, \(D_{2}\) failed) for \(W\)-jet signal and in region 0 and region 1 (\(m_{J}\) passed, \(D_{2}\) failed) for top-jets background come from the flavour tagging uncertainties, as discussed in Section 5.

Figures 7 (a) and (b) show the bkg-jet rejection estimated in data (in region 0) in multijet and \(\gamma\)+jets topologies, respectively. The obtained scale factors are close to unity in all of parameter spaces. In the intermediate \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) region, \(450\GeV<p_{\mathrm{T}}<1600\GeV\), both multijet and \(\gamma\)+jets measurements are available. It is found that the two measurements are consistent within the statistical uncertainty, though the statistics of the \(\gamma\)+jets events is poor in the high-\(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) region.

## 7 Conclusion

The performance of a \(W/Z\)-boson tagger optimised for a diboson resonance search in semi-leptonic final states is presented. The tagger efficiencies for \(W\)-jet signals and top-jet background are measured using \(t\bar{t}\) events, while the tagger rejection factor for bkg-jets are measured using multijet and \(\gamma\)+jets events. The measured signal efficiency and the background rejection factor in data agree with Monte Carlo simulation within the evaluated systematic uncertainty in all regions used in the search.
