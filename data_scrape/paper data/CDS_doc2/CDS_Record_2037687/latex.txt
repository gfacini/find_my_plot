**Abstract**

We present the inclusive \(m_{\gamma\gamma}\), \(p_{\rm T,\gamma\gamma}\) and \(\Delta\phi_{\gamma\gamma}\) spectra of isolated di-photon pairs passing a tight selection criterion in 6.4 pb\({}^{-1}\) of \(pp\) collision data collected by ATLAS at \(\sqrt{s}\) = 13 TeV in 2015. Di-photon candidates are formed from photon candidates with transverse momentum larger then 15 GeV, selected in the precision acceptance of the ATLAS electromagnetic calorimeter (\(|\eta|<1.37\) and \(1.52<|\eta|<2.37\)), and having an angular separation \(\Delta R_{\gamma\gamma}>0.4\). The isolation properties of the selected photon candidates are discussed, in comparison to those of background-enriched samples.

## 1 Introduction

The measurement of the production cross section of two prompt isolated photons in \(pp\) collisions at the LHC provides a tool to probe perturbative Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) predictions, and to understand the irreducible background to physics processes involving photons in the final state, e.g. the Higgs boson decays to photon pairs \(H\to\gamma\gamma\). Cross section measurements for di-photon production at the LHC have been performed by ATLAS [1, 2] and CMS [3] using \(\sqrt{s}=7\) TeV \(pp\) collisions.

In this note, we present inclusive \(m_{\gamma\gamma}\), \(p_{\rm T,\gamma\gamma}\) and \(\Delta\phi_{\gamma\gamma}\)1 spectra of isolated di-photon candidates in about 6.4 pb\({}^{-1}\) of \(pp\) collision data at \(\sqrt{s}=13\) TeV, collected by ATLAS in 2015 with a di-photon trigger with symmetric transverse momentum thresholds of 10 GeV on each photon2. Di-photon candidates are formed from photon candidates with transverse momentum larger then 15 GeV, selected in the precision acceptance of the ATLAS electromagnetic calorimeter (\(|\eta|<1.37\) and \(1.52<|\eta|<2.37\)), and having an angular separation \(\Delta R_{\gamma\gamma}=\sqrt{\Delta\eta_{\gamma\gamma}^{2}+\Delta\phi_{\gamma \gamma}^{2}}>0.4\). The isolation properties of the leading and subleading photon candidates in the selected pairs, ranked according to their transverse momentum, are discussed in comparison to those of background-enriched samples.

Footnote 1: ATLAS uses a right-handed coordinate system with its origin at the nominal interaction point (IP) in the center of the detector and the \(z\)-axis coinciding with the axis of the beam pipe. The \(x\)-axis points from the IP to the centre of the LHC ring, and the \(y\)-axis points upward. Cylindrical coordinates (\(r\),\(\phi\)) are used in the transverse plane, \(\phi\) being the azimuthal angle around the beam pipe. The pseudorapidity is defined in terms of the polar angle \(\theta\) as \(\eta=-\ln\tan(\theta/2)\).

Footnote 2: The uncertainty on the integrated luminosity is \(\pm 9\%\). It is derived, following a methodology similar to that detailed in Ref. [4], from a preliminary calibration of the luminosity scale using a pair of \(x-y\) beam-separation scans performed in June 2015.

## 2 The ATLAS Detector

ATLAS [5] is a multipurpose detector with a forward-backward symmetric cylindrical geometry and nearly \(4\pi\) coverage in solid angle. The most relevant subdetectors for the present analysis are the inner tracking detector (ID) and the calorimeters.

The ID consists of a silicon pixel detector and a silicon microstrip detector covering the pseudorapidity range \(|\eta|<2.5\), and a straw tube transition radiation tracker covering \(|\eta|<2.0\). It is immersed in a 2 T magnetic field provided by a superconducting solenoid. The ID allows efficient reconstruction of converted photons if the conversion occurs at a radius of up to \(\approx 0.80\) m.

The electromagnetic calorimeter (ECAL) is a lead/liquid-argon (LAr) sampling calorimeter providing coverage for \(|\eta|<3.2\). It consists of a barrel section (\(|\eta|<1.475\)) and two end-caps (\(1.375<|\eta|<3.2\)). The central region (\(|\eta|<2.5\)) is segmented into three longitudinal layers. The first (inner) layer, covering \(|\eta|<1.4\) in the barrel and \(1.5<|\eta|<2.4\) in the end-caps, has high granularity in the \(\eta\) direction (\(\Delta\eta\) between 0.003 and 0.006 depending on the \(\eta\) position), sufficient to provide event-by-event discrimination between single-photon showers and two overlapping showers originating from the photon-pair decay of a neutral hadron. The second layer, which collects most of the energy deposited in the calorimeter by the photon shower, has a cell granularity of 0.025\(\times\)0.025 in \(\eta\times\phi\). The third layer is used to correct high energy showers for leakage beyond the ECAL. In front of the electromagnetic calorimeter a thin presampler layer, covering the pseudorapidity interval \(|\eta|<1.8\), is used to correct for energy loss before the ECAL.

The hadronic calorimeter (HCAL), surrounding the ECAL, consists of an iron/scintillator tile calorimeter in the range \(|\eta|<1.7\), and two copper/LAr calorimeters spanning \(1.5<|\eta|<3.2\). The ECAL and HCAL acceptance is extended by two LAr forward calorimeters (using copper and tungsten as absorbers) up to \(|\eta|<4.9\).

Di-photon events are recorded using a two-level trigger system. The first level, implemented in hardware, is based on towers defined with a coarser granularity (\(0.1\times 0.1\) in \(\eta\times\phi\)) than that of the ECAL. They are used to search for electromagnetic deposits in \(\eta\times\phi\) regions of \(2\times 1\) and \(1\times 2\) towers, within a fixed window of size \(2\times 2\) and with a transverse energy above a programmable threshold. The second level triggers are implemented in software, and exploit the full granularity and energy calibration of the calorimeter to refine the first-level trigger selection.

## 3 Data selection

Events are collected from \(pp\) collision data collected by ATLAS in June 2015, using a di-photon trigger with a transverse energy threshold of 10 GeV for both photon candidates. The photon trigger objects are required to pass a selection based on shower shape variables computed from the energy deposits in the second layer of the electromagnetic calorimeter and in the hadronic calorimeter. The requirements are looser than the photon identification criteria applied in the offline selection. Only events taken in stable beam conditions and passing detector and data-quality requirements are considered. The events are required to have at least one reconstructed primary vertex formed from at least two tracks with \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>500\) MeV, consistent with the average beam-spot position. The data used in this note correspond to an integrated luminosity of about 6.4 pb\({}^{-1}\).

Photons are reconstructed from electromagnetic energy clusters in the calorimeter and tracking information provided by the ID. Photons reconstructed near regions of the calorimeter affected by read-out or high-voltage failures are not considered. An energy calibration specifically optimized for photons is applied to the candidates to account for upstream energy loss and both lateral and longitudinal leakage.

Events with at least two photon candidates with \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\gamma}>15\) GeV and \(|\eta^{\gamma}|<1.37\) or \(1.52\leq|\eta^{\gamma}|<2.37\) are retained: the latter requirement ensures that the photon candidates pass through regions of the electromagnetic calorimeter where the first layer is segmented into narrow strips, allowing a good separation between genuine prompt photons and photons coming from the decay of neutral hadrons in jets.

We initially retain di-photon candidates passing loose identification requirements, based on the same shower shape variables and the same thresholds used at trigger level. Two further criteria are used to define the signal region. Both photon candidates must pass a tight identification selection, designed to reject hadronic jet background by imposing requirements on nine discriminating variables computed from the energy leaking into the hadronic calorimeter and the lateral and longitudinal shower development in the electromagnetic calorimeters. This selection uses the same variables exploited in previous measurements [2], but was explicitly optimized for the beginning of the 2015 data taking. Candidates passing the initial loose selection but failing the tight criteria are used to populate background-enriched control regions, used to study the isolation properties of the leading and subleading photon candidates in the selected pairs.

The photon candidates must also have \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{iso}}<4\) GeV, where \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{iso}}\) is the isolation transverse energy, in a cone \(\Delta R=0.4\), computed as the sum of the positive-energy topological clusters [6] after subtracting the contributions from the photon itself, and corrected for the leakage of the photon energy and the effects of underlying event and pileup [7; 8]. The angular separation between the two photons \(\Delta R_{\gamma\gamma}\) is required to be larger than 0.4, in order to avoid one photon candidate depositing significant energy in the isolation cone of the other.

The above requirements select approximately 5400 di-photon candidates.

## 4 Properties of leading and subleading photon candidates in selected pairs

Figure 1 shows the distribution of the transverse momentum for the leading and subleading photon in the selected photon pairs.

Figures 2 and 3 show the isolation transverse energy distribution for the leading and subleading photon respectively, when the isolation requirement has been dropped in order to determine the background contamination. The distribution of photon candidates passing the tight identification criteria is compared to that of candidates failing the same identification criteria. The distribution of these "non-tight" candidates (mainly jets containing a neutral hadron carrying a large fraction of the jet energy) is scaled to have the same integral as that of the tight ones for \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{iso}}>10\) GeV.

The rescaled \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{iso}}\) distribution of the "non-tight" leading and subleading candidates, considered as representative of the background component in the tight candidate distribution, can be subtracted to evaluate the isolation profile of signal-like leading and subleading photons. When considering the region \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{iso}}<4\) GeV which defines the isolated di-photon pairs, the background contribution estimated with the above method is about 40% for the leading photon candidates, and about 50% for the subleading candidates.

## 5 Inclusive properties of the di-photon candidates

Figures 4 and 5 respectively show the inclusive invariant mass spectrum and the inclusive transverse momentum distribution of the selected di-photon pairs. An enhancement in the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\gamma\gamma}\) spectrum is observed between 20 GeV and 40 GeV, about the sum of the \(E_{\mathrm{T}}\) thresholds of the two photons, as expected from beyond leading-order contributions [9]. Figure 6 shows the distribution of the azimuthal separation of the leading and subleading photons in the selected di-photon pairs. All distributions are divided by the bin width.

Note that these plots cannot be directly interpreted as cross sections, as they do not account for the varying signal efficiency corrections, nor for the differential contributions of background processes. These processes consist of jet-jet and \(\gamma\)-jet events, where the jet fakes a photon that passes the tight identification criterion and the isolation requirement; and of Drell-Yan \(e^{+}e^{-}\) events, where the electron and the positron are mistakenly reconstructed as photons.
