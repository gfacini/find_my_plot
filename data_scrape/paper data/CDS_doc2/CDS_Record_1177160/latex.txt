###### Abstract

We discuss a new data-driven estimation technique, denoted _Tiles Method_, for Standard Model (SM) background in inclusive SUSY searches. The Tiles Method translates prior knowledge on the SM distributions of discriminating variables in a two or higher dimensional grid into an estimate of the abundances of SM and beyond-SM events. Depending on the grid granularity, the abundances are calculated by solving a system of linear equations or by minimising a log-likelihood function. The method does not rely on assumptions on background dominance for particular values of the variables, nor does it require iterations. Correlations between the variables are fully taken into account for SM events, while they are assumed to vanish for beyond-SM events. Systematic effects due to uncertainties in the simulated prior distributions are investigated. Results for various mSUGRA scenarios are presented.

Introduction

In \(R\)-parity conserving Supersymmetry (SUSY), the hard-scattering interaction of two protons can only produce an even number of Supersymmetric particles, which decay incoherently in cascades to ever lighter particles, conserving the initial negative \(R\) parity in each decay. Consequently, the lightest SUSY particle, denoted LSP, is stable and, because it is weakly interacting only, escapes detection. The resulting characteristic missing transverse energy (\(E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}\)) signature drives the search strategy for such events. Due to the production of two LSP in the event, its kinematic reconstruction is under-determined (transverse balance of the event provides only one two-dimensional constraint), thus not allowing one to reconstruct the masses of the involved SUSY particles in the cascades on an event-by-event basis. One is hence left with searching for a statistical excess in events with large \(E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}\), rather than mass peaks over broader distributed background. This significantly complicates the analysis. While background under a peak can be empirically determined from the observed data using simultaneous fits together with the signal without relying on Monte Carlo (MC) simulation, use of simulation is required when comparing event abundances only, without extracting shape information from the data. However, for experiments operating at the high energy frontier it is not possible to rely solely on MC simulation. These are inaccurate due to various uncertainties, including parton density distributions for protons at 14 TeV centre-of-mass energy, cross sections of the involved Standard Model (SM) processes, and the details of the detector response. It is thus mandatory to develop strategies to determine the expected SM background (and, simultaneously, the observed signal abundance) in an as model-independent manner as possible.

Throughout this note we assume that the overall numbers of SM background and beyond-SM signal events1 in the observed data sample are unknown. Some prior information from MC simulation and/or "calibration" measurements on the shapes of the discriminating variables must therefore be inserted, since otherwise the problem would be undetermined. A convenient approach, often called the \(M_{T}\)_-method_[1], has been to define an area of _low_ transverse mass2\(M_{T}\) and \(E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}\) values, which is assumed to be background dominated, and a corresponding _high_\(M_{T}\), \(E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}\) area, sensitive to SUSY signal. The number of signal events is then approximated by \(N^{\rm signal}[{\rm high}]=N^{\rm observed}[{\rm high}]-f^{\rm SM}[{\rm high }]/f^{\rm SM}[{\rm low}]\cdot N^{\rm observed}[{\rm low}]\), where \(f^{\rm SM}\) denotes the fraction of SM events. However, in presence of signal contamination in the low region, the number of signal events in the high region is in general underestimated, which - depending on the SUSY model - can be a gross effect. To remedy this bias, an iterative procedure has been developed (so called _New \(M_{T}\)-method_[1]), reinserting the estimated number of signal events in the low region and repeating the \(N^{\rm signal}[{\rm high}]\) estimate. However, such methods do not converge if no additional prior information is inserted. For the case that additional prior information is used, the iterative methods may still not be well-behaved, and it may be difficult to define an unambiguous stop criterion. Another problem with this method is that it relies on vanishing correlations between the two variables (\(M_{T}\), \(E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}\)) both for signal and SM background. This conjecture however is inaccurate, leading to biases in the determined SM background in the high region. In particular, positive (negative) correlations in the SM background sample lead to an underestimation (overestimation) of the SM abundance in the high region.

Footnote 1: While all studies involving signal MC throughout this note employ SUSY models, the proposed background estimation method is largely independent of it. It only requires at least two variables capable of discriminating signal from background, and can hence be applied to almost any analysis searching for unknown beyond-SM signals.

Footnote 2: \(M_{T}\) is defined in Table 1.

In this note, we systematically revisit the formalism to determine background estimates from data after insertion of prior information on the distributions of the discriminating variables for the SM background. We denote by _Tiles_ the regions in the (generally, but not necessarily) two-dimensional variable space. We show that for at least 2\(\times\)2 Tiles the resulting system of linear equations can be solved without requiring zero-signal contamination in the background dominated area, and vanishing correlations between the variables for background events, albeit maintaining this assumption for signal. While for 2\(\times\)2 Tiles the solution can be analytically derived, a fit must be performed for a larger number of Tiles because the system is overconstrained. In all these cases, a unique best solution is found, and there is no need to recur to iterations.

Other background estimation techniques have been developed by ATLAS and are fully described in [1]. These include estimating the individual background contributions from full reconstruction or MC "redecay", using extrapolation from sidebands, as well as carrying out a combined fit to the signal and control regions. To have confidence in the background estimate it is important to be able to cross-check these methods against each other. The Tiles method should give similar results to a combined fit method, and these results should be compatible with summing up estimates of the individual background components from other methods. Significant disagreement among the results would indicate that the backgrounds are not well understood. The main difference between the Tiles method and the combined fit method is that the Tiles method does not require a model for the signal PDF - beyond the stated assumption.

The note is organised as follows. Section 2 summarises the one-lepton SUSY search analysis as relevant for the present study. Described are the MC datasets and the event selection used in the analysis. In Section 3 the _Tiles Method_ for 2\(\times\)2 tiles and general \(n\)\(\times\)\(n\) tiles is derived. Systematic uncertainties arising from the residual MC dependence are quantified and the SUSY discovery potential using this method is evaluated.

## 2 One-Lepton Search Mode

The one-lepton inclusive channel is among the most prominent modes for SUSY searches with early LHC data. The one-lepton requirement reduces background from QCD jets, leaving \(t\bar{t}\) (92%) and \(W\)+jets (7%) processes as the dominant and subdominant SM backgrounds, respectively.

### Datasets

The same datasets as in Ref. [1] are used, except that high statistics top samples generated with Alpgen [2] are used here instead of MC@NLO [3] top samples.

All studies involving SUSY signal in this note use Minimal Supergravity (mSUGRA) scenarios reducing the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model parameter space to four real parameters and one sign at grand unification scale. Many illustrations are done for a specific mSUGRA benchmark point, SU3, with the characteristics:

* \(m_{0}=100\,\,\mathrm{GeV}\), \(m_{1/2}=300\,\,\mathrm{GeV}\), \(A_{0}=-300\,\,\mathrm{GeV}\), \(\tan\beta=6\), \(\mu>0\); it corresponds to the "bulk" region where LSP annihilation occurs primarily through light sleptons exchange; the next-to-leading order (NLO) cross section amounts to 27.7 pb.

A full list of the ATLAS mSUGRA benchmark points is given in Ref. [4]. All results given in this note correspond to an integrated luminosity of \(L=1\,\mathrm{fb}^{-1}\), taken at 14 TeV centre-of-mass energy.

### Object and Variable Definition

We use the object and variable definitions from Ref. [1]. The definitions of the global event variables important for this note are recalled in Table 1. The requirements for particle identification are summarised below.

* Electrons are reconstructed with the standard ATLAS \(e/\gamma\) algorithm and must satisfy the medium electron requirements [5]. The following isolation requirements are imposed: less than 10 \(\,\mathrm{GeV}\) of energy in a cone of size \(\Delta R=0.2\) around the electron, and an angular distance to the nearest jet of \(\sqrt{\Delta\phi^{2}+\Delta\eta^{2}}>0.4\). Events with selected electrons pointing at the crack region between the barrel and the endcap of the calorimeter are rejected.
* Muons are reconstructed with the STACO algorithm [6] as the best match combination of tracks found in the muon spectrometer and in the inner detector. They are required to satisfy \(\chi^{2}/\mathrm{d.o.f.}<100\) and the same isolation criteria as for electrons are applied.
* Jets are reconstructed as cones of tower clusters within a radius of 0.4 [7].
* Taus and photons are not considered separately, but treated as jets.

In the remainder of this note the word "lepton" is used to denote isolated electrons and muons.

### Event Selection

The event selection of the one-lepton search channel follows Ref. [1]. It is summarised in Table 2. Figure 1 shows the resulting \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\), \(M_{\mathrm{eff}}\), \(M_{T}\) and lepton \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) distributions for the SU3 model and the SM background processes after the selection. The discovery potential is studied for four different cuts on \(M_{\mathrm{eff}}\) (\(M_{\mathrm{eff}}>0.4,0.8,1.2,1.6\,\mathrm{TeV}\)).

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{l l} \hline \hline Variable & Definition \\ \hline \(M_{\mathrm{eff}}\) & Scalar sum of \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\) and the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) of the four hardest jets and the lepton: \\  & \(M_{\mathrm{eff}}=E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}+\sum_{i=1}^{4}p_{\mathrm{T}}^{ \mathrm{jet}i}+p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{lep}}\). \\ \(M_{T}\) & Transverse (invariant) mass of lepton and \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\): \(M_{T}^{2}=2p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{lep}}E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}(1- \cos(\Delta\phi))\), \\  & where \(\Delta\phi\) is the azimuthal angle between the \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\) direction and the lepton. \\ \(S_{T}\) & Transverse sphericity: \(S_{T}=2\lambda_{2}/(\lambda_{1}+\lambda_{2})\), where \(\lambda_{1}\) and \(\lambda_{2}\) are the eigenvalues of the 2\(\times\)2 sphericity tensor \(S_{ij}=\sum_{k}p_{ki}p^{kj}\), where the sum runs over all jets and the lepton, \\  & and \(i\) and \(j\) are the \(x\) and \(y\) coordinates. \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}

## 3 The Tiles Method

The _Tiles method_ is an approach to derive the number of SM background and beyond-SM signal events from data, using varying degrees of MC dependency. It addresses some of the problems present in the \(M_{T}\)-method, namely the biases caused by signal contamination in the background region and by variable correlations. Akin to the \(M_{T}\)-method, the Tiles method exploits two discriminating variables with good separation power to segment the data into several quadrants (tiles). Figure 2 shows the most basic setup of 2\(\times\)2 tiles in the variables \(M_{T}\) and \(M_{\text{eff}}\). Generalisation to another set of variables, or to more than two variables is straightforward, but not discussed in this note.

The Tiles method in its most basic form requires the following assumptions.

1. The relative inclusive fractions of SM background events in each tile are predicted by MC simulation. Hence in the limit of an infinite number of infinitesimal tiles it is required that the full two-dimensional probability density function of the chosen variables is known.
2. The discriminating variables are mutually independent for signal events.
3. In presence of signal, the distributions of events among the tiles need to be different for signal and background.

Assumptions 1. and 2. can be only approximately realised in an analysis, and violations must be thoroughly studied. The accurateness of assumption 3. is not known _a priori_. In presence of signal it will be empirically ascertained by the Tiles method: if a significant signal yield is found such that the zero-signal

From top left to bottom right: \(M_{\text{eff}}\), \(E_{\text{T}}^{\text{miss}}\), \(M_{T}\), lepton \(p_{\text{T}}\). The cut \(M_{T}>100\) GeV was dropped for the \(M_{T}\) distribution.

hypothesis is excluded, the signal events must be distributed differently from the SM background, otherwise their discrimination from background would not be possible. On the other hand, if no _significant_ signal is present, a distribution of signal events among the tiles cannot be determined so that also the signal abundance itself is undetermined. The no-signal case is therefore not detected by a vanishing signal yield (which can be anything), but by a solution of the tiles method (either analytical, or via a fit) that is approximately independent of the signal yield that is assumed.3) The no-signal case is effectively equal to the case where signal and background distributions are indistinguishable. Both cases would exhibit anticorrelations close to unity between the signal and background yields returned by the method, whose sum must be equal to the number of observed events.

Footnote 3): In other words, the \(\Delta\mathrm{ln}\mathscr{L}\) difference between free signal yield and signal yield fixed to zero is insignificant (cf. Section 3.3).

With the above assumptions, the Tiles method has remarkable features as outlined below.

* The overall SM background event yields for one or several inclusive background components, and the overall inclusive beyond-SM event yield are fully derived by the method.
* No assumption is made about the distribution of signal events among the tiles, thereby excluding any prejudice about background domination in particular tiles.
* The Tiles method also determines the signal event fraction in each tile, thus providing a signal shape estimate within the chosen granularity of the tiles.
* If the model consists of more than 2\(\times\)2 tiles, the unknowns are overconstrained and the assumptions can be tested via a log-likelihood test statistics.
* If the model consists of more than 2\(\times\)2 tiles, parts of the model assumptions can be relaxed to improve the goodness of the model.

We first discuss the minimum 2\(\times\)2 tiles setup, before generalising the approach to \(n\times n\) tiles. Various configurations are studied using toy experiments. Systematic uncertainties are evaluated by varying the MC composition and shape. Within the context of this note, we limit ourselves to the one-lepton search channel and choose the event variables \(M_{T}\) and \(M_{\mathrm{eff}}\) to segment the data into tiles. The Tiles method is applied to preselected data samples including a minimum \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\) requirement (cf. Section 2.3 without the \(M_{T}\) requirement).

Figure 2: Transverse mass (\(M_{T}\)) versus effective mass (\(M_{\mathrm{eff}}\)) distributions for simulated SM background events (left) and SUSY SU3 events (right). Indicated by the capital letters are the 2\(\times\)2 tiles determined by the cross borders along \(M_{\mathrm{eff}}=800\,\) GeV and \(M_{T}=100\,\) GeV. The correlation coefficients are 6.6% (SM) and 10.7% (SU3).

### 2\(\times\)2 Tiles Method

Following Fig. 2 we denote the four tiles \((M_{\rm eff}^{\rm low},M_{T}^{\rm low})\), \((M_{\rm eff}^{\rm low},M_{T}^{\rm high})\), \((M_{\rm eff}^{\rm high},M_{T}^{\rm low})\), and \((M_{\rm eff}^{\rm high},M_{T}^{\rm high})\) by the letters \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\), respectively, where the low and high areas are segmented along the values \(M_{\rm eff}=800\,\) GeV and \(M_{T}=100\,\) GeV. The expected total number of events in each tile is given by

\[\begin{array}{rclrcl}\bar{N}_{A}&=&f_{A}^{\rm SM}\bar{N}^{\rm SM}+f_{A}^{\rm S }\bar{N}^{\rm S}\,,&&\bar{N}_{B}&=&f_{B}^{\rm SM}\bar{N}^{\rm SM}+f_{B}^{\rm S} \bar{N}^{\rm S}\,,\\ \bar{N}_{C}&=&f_{C}^{\rm SM}\bar{N}^{\rm SM}+f_{C}^{\rm S}\bar{N}^{\rm S}\,,&& \bar{N}_{D}&=&f_{D}^{\rm SM}\bar{N}^{\rm SM}+f_{D}^{\rm S}\bar{N}^{\rm S}\,, \end{array} \tag{1}\]

where the first and second terms on the r.h.s. denote the expected SM background and beyond-SM signal contribution, respectively, determined by the expected number of events passing the preselection requirements, and by the corresponding fractions of events in the tiles. Unitarity implies \(\bar{N}_{A}+\bar{N}_{B}+\bar{N}_{C}+\bar{N}_{D}=\bar{N}^{\rm SM}+\bar{N}^{\rm S}\).

Equation (1) forms a system of four independent linear equations which, once confronted with the observations \(\bar{N}_{A}=N_{A},\ldots,\bar{N}_{D}=N_{D}\), contains 10 unknowns. Taking the SM tile fractions \(f_{A}^{\rm SM},\ldots,f_{D}^{\rm SM}\) from MC (condition 1) reduces the number of unknowns to 6. Requiring further that the signal variables be independent (condition 2), one can write

\[\begin{array}{rclrclrcl}f_{A}^{\rm S}&=&(1-f_{M_{\rm eff}}^{\rm S})(1-f_{M_{ T}}^{\rm S})\,,&&f_{B}^{\rm S}&=&(1-f_{M_{\rm eff}}^{\rm S})f_{M_{T}}^{\rm S}\,, \\ f_{C}^{\rm S}&=&f_{M_{\rm eff}}^{\rm S}(1-f_{M_{T}}^{\rm S})\,,&&f_{D}^{\rm S} &=&f_{M_{\rm eff}}^{\rm S}f_{M_{T}}^{\rm S}\,,\end{array} \tag{2}\]

leaving 4 unknowns that can be eliminated by solving the system (1). For example, for the expected number of SM background events one finds4

Footnote 4: The signal tile fractions are given by

\[\begin{array}{rclrcl}f_{M_{\rm eff}}^{\rm S}&=&1+\frac{1}{2\big{(}f_{A}+f_{B }\big{)}\big{(}N_{C}+N_{D}\big{)}-2\big{(}f_{C}+f_{D}\big{)}\big{(}N_{A}+N_{B }\big{)}}\bigg{(}f_{D}N_{A}+f_{C}\big{(}2N_{A}+N_{B}\big{)}-f_{B}N_{C}\\ &&\quad-f_{A}\big{(}2N_{C}+N_{D}\big{)}+\Big{[}f_{D}^{2}N_{A}^{2}+f_{C}^{2}N_{ B}^{2}+\big{(}f_{B}N_{C}-f_{A}N_{D}\big{)}^{2}-2f_{D}\big{(}f_{C}N_{A}N_{B}+f_{B}N_{ A}N_{C}\\ &&\quad-2f_{A}N_{B}N_{C}+f_{A}N_{A}N_{D}\big{)}-2f_{C}\big{(}f_{B}N_{B}N_{C}-2 f_{B}N_{A}N_{D}+f_{A}N_{B}N_{D}\big{)}\Big{]}^{1/2}\bigg{)}\,,\\ f_{M_{T}}^{\rm S}&=&1+\frac{1}{2\big{(}f_{A}+f_{C}\big{)}\big{(}N_{B}+N_{D} \big{)}-2\big{(}f_{B}+f_{D}\big{)}\big{(}N_{A}+N_{C}\big{)}}\bigg{(}f_{D}N_{A }-f_{C}N_{B}+f_{B}\big{(}2N_{A}+N_{C}\big{)}\\ &&\quad-f_{A}\big{(}2N_{B}+N_{D}\big{)}+\Big{[}f_{D}^{2}N_{A}^{2}+f_{C}^{2}N_{ B}^{2}+\big{(}f_{B}N_{C}-f_{A}N_{D}\big{)}^{2}-2f_{D}\big{(}f_{C}N_{A}N_{B}+f_{B}N_{ A}N_{C}\\ &&\quad-2f_{A}N_{B}N_{C}+f_{A}N_{A}N_{D}\big{)}-2f_{C}\big{(}f_{B}N_{B}N_{C}-2 f_{B}N_{A}N_{D}+f_{A}N_{B}N_{D}\big{)}\Big{]}^{1/2}\bigg{)}\,.\end{array}\]

\[\begin{array}{rclrclrcl}N^{\rm S}&=&1+\frac{1}{2\big{(}f_{A}+f_{B}\big{)} \big{(}N_{C}+N_{D}\big{)}-2\big{(}f_{C}+f_{D}\big{)}\big{(}N_{A}+N_{B}\big{)}} \bigg{(}f_{D}N_{A}+f_{C}\big{(}2N_{A}+N_{B}\big{)}-f_{B}N_{C}\\ &&\quad-f_{A}\big{(}2N_{C}+N_{D}\big{)}+\Big{[}f_{D}^{2}N_{A}^{2}+f_{C}^{2}N_{ B}^{2}+\big{(}f_{B}N_{C}-f_{A}N_{D}\big{)}^{2}-2f_{D}\big{(}f_{C}N_{A}N_{B}+f_{B}N_{ A}N_{C}\\ &&\quad-2f_{A}N_{B}N_{C}+f_{A}N_{A}N_{D}\big{)}-2f_{C}\big{(}f_{B}N_{B}N_{C}-2 f_{B}N_{A}N_{D}+f_{A}N_{B}N_{D}\big{)}\Big{]}^{1/2}\bigg{)}\,.\end{array}\]

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:8]

these lines (if \(n\) is odd, \((n-1)/2\) go below and \((n+1)/2\) above). The very first and very last tile boundary is chosen (in both variables) such that the corresponding tiles contain a minimum of \(1/n\) of the total events in the projected variable. The sum of SM background and SU3 signal events is used to populate the variable space. The variable space between the fixed initial boundaries and the first (last) boundaries is equidistantly distributed among the remaining tiles.

Ignoring signal correlations, the method provides \(n^{2}\) equations determining \(2n\) unknowns (\(2(n-1)\) unknowns for the projected signal fractions and 2 unknowns for the overall signal and SM background event yields). The problem is hence overconstrained for \(n>2\), and a unique solution can be found only via minimisation of an estimator which allows to optimise the agreement between model and observed data, thereby adjusting the unknown model parameters. We hence define the following extended negative log-likelihood estimator

\[-\ln\!\mathcal{L}=\sum_{i,j=1}^{n}\left(\bar{N}_{ij}-N_{ij}\ln\!\bar{N}_{ij} \right)\,, \tag{7}\]

where \(N_{ij}\) denotes the number of observed events in tile \((i,j)\), and where \(\bar{N}_{ij}=f_{ij}^{\rm SM}\bar{N}^{\rm SM}+f_{M_{T},i}^{\rm S}f_{M_{et},i}^{ \rm S}\bar{N}^{\rm S}\) is the corresponding expected number of events (\(f_{ij}^{\rm SM}\) is the short-hand notation of \(f_{M_{T},i}^{\rm SM}\),\(M_{et,i}\)). Owing to the unitarity condition \(\sum_{i,j}f_{ij}^{\rm SM,S}=1\), their sum obeys \(\bar{N}=\sum_{ij}\bar{N}_{ij}=\bar{N}^{\rm SM}+\bar{N}^{\rm S}\). The likelihood extension (terms before the sum on the r.h.s.) ensures the normalisation \(\bar{N}=N\). Minimising \(-\ln\!\mathcal{L}\) is equivalent to solving an unbinned maximum-likelihood (ML) fit, where the background and signal probability density functions (PDF) are one two-dimensional and two one-dimensional binned histograms, respectively, with the bin boundaries equal to the tile divisions. Both fit versions have been implemented for this analysis, namely, a TMinuit minimisation of Eq. (7), and an unbinned ML fit [8], giving identical results. Minimising Eq. (7) for 2\(\times\)2 tiles reproduces the results from the analytical solution.

The generalisation to \(n\)\(\times\)\(n\) (\(n>2\)) tiles has advantages and drawbacks.

* It improves the information content of the fit and thus should in most cases (except for very small sample sizes) lead to a more precise determination of the overall SM and signal yields. There exists however an optimum choice: a too large number of tiles dilutes the information and increases the statistical errors on the fit parameters.
* It probes the signal shape in the two-dimensional variable space.
* The \(\ln\!\mathcal{L}_{\rm min}\) value returned by the fit can be used to estimate the goodness of the fit by comparison with toy MC experiments.
* Bad goodness-of-fit values may be improved by relaxing the model assumptions, e.g., by adding free parameters correcting deficiencies in the prediction of the background PDFs, or by including a limited amount of signal correlation that may be determined by the fit.
* The use of many tiles increases the dependence on a correct description of the two-dimensional background shape.

### Signal Significance

The significance of a signal observed with the Tiles method for any number of tiles \(n\geq 2\) can be derived in a straightforward manner using the \(\ln\!\mathcal{L}\) estimator defined in Eq. (7). Two fits are performed for this purpose, one with free varying \(N^{\rm S}\), and another where \(N^{\rm S}=0\) is fixed (null hypothesis). The difference (\(\Delta\!\ln\!\mathcal{L}\)) between the \(\ln\!\mathcal{L}\) values found in these fits is compared to the expectation from toy experiments generated for the null hypothesis. One hence obtains the p-value to observe a given \(\Delta\!\ln\!\mathcal{L}\) in presence of 

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:10]

The lower left-hand plot in Fig. 4 gives the error on the fitted signal yield versus the tile configuration. As expected, an increased number of tiles first improves the statistical precision of the fit owing to the refined shape information exploited by fit. However, when inflating the number of tiles, the precision deteriorates because large statistical fluctuations within the tiles obstruct an accurate determination of the tile fractions.

Table 3 lists the statistical errors and biases due to signal correlations for all SUSY benchmark points for a setup of \(8\times 8\) tiles.

### Splitting SM Contributions

Generalisation to \(n\geq 3\) tile configurations allows to extend the number of fitted event yields and to thus determine individual background components. For example, a \(3\times 3\) tiles fit provides \(9-6=3\) degrees of freedom such that up to 4 background contributions may be determined. It allows one to improve the finesse of the data-driven background estimate, which reduces systematic errors.9) For \(K\) individual SM background contributions, the expected number of events for tile \(ij\) is given by

Footnote 9: More precisely: parameters that suffer from systematic uncertainties are determined from data; hence systematic errors are transformed into statistical ones.

\[\bar{N}_{ij}=\sum_{k=1}^{K}f^{\text{SM}}_{ij,k}\bar{N}^{\text{SM}}_{k}+f^{ \text{S}}_{M_{T},ij}f^{\text{S}}_{M_{\text{eff}},ij}\bar{N}^{\text{S}}\,, \tag{10}\]

where \(\sum_{ij}f^{\text{SM}}_{ij,k}=1\) for all \(k=1,\ldots,K\), and where all \(f^{\text{SM}}_{ij,k}\) are taken from MC simulation. Only background components with sufficiently different shapes (and hence different fractions \(f^{\text{SM}}_{ij,k}\)) can be constrained by the fit (cf. Fig. 1 in Section 2.3). Shape similarity will lead to anticorrelations between the fitted \(\bar{N}^{\text{SM}}_{k}\).

We point out that splitting the SM background into more than one components, with their yields determined by the fit, is equivalent to the treatment for "uncertainties in the tile fractions" discussed in Section 3.4 when using Eq. (8) without adding the penalty (9). In most cases prior information on the expected yields from MC simulation is available and should be used via adding a penalty function to the fit.

### Sensitivity to Systematic Effects

The Tiles method depends on the SM MC fractions for each tile but we cannot expect the simulation to fully reproduce the data. We have studied the effects of systematic uncertainties in the SM fractions on the fitted signal event yield and tile fractions, to assess the sensitivity of the method to its inherent

assumptions. The underlying systematic uncertainties have been estimated where possible, or simply sampled otherwise. Because a full systematic error analysis cannot be done with simulated data only, the absolute effects reported in the following may not be representative of the real situation. The relative effects however should be so. Due to the same reason, the systematic analysis is necessarily incomplete. In particular, we do not include here uncertainties in the tails of the SM distributions, which - although crucial for the analysis - strongly depend on the detector condition at the time the data sample has been recorded.

Where necessary, systematic variations have been propagated throughout the entire analysis chain to properly include all effects. This applies to the uncertainties in the jet energy scale and \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\) resolution. Elsewhere, we simply rescale cross sections of certain processes. Examples here are uncertainties in the relative background composition and in the lepton ID and jet reconstruction efficiencies. Common to all systematic effects is that they affect the distributions of the discriminating variables and thereby modify the SM tile fractions.

Systematic effects on the signal yields are quantified for different tile configurations for the SUSY benchmark point SU3.

We note that the central \(M_{T}\) tile boundary has been moved from 100  to 110  in this study, that is, away from the sharp edge in its distribution, which drastically reduces the sensitivity to systematic effects in that variable.

#### Jet Energy Scale (JES)

Assuming a 10% systematic uncertainty in the JES, the energies and momenta of all jets are correspondingly scaled up and down. The rescaling is subsequently propagated into the transverse components of the \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\) vector. All derived variables including \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\), \(M_{\mathrm{eff}}\), and \(M_{T}\) and the corresponding tile fractions are then recomputed. A bias of order 60 events is found for 8\(\times\)8 tiles, corresponding to a systematic error of 8%.

#### \(\mathrm{E}_{T}^{\mathrm{miss}}\) Resolution

The effect of a systematic uncertainty in the \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\) resolution is studied by independently smearing the transverse components of the \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\) vector via addition of a Gaussian noise term of width in units of the \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\) resolution, \(0.64\cdot\sum E_{T}[\,\mathrm{GeV}]\). The independent smearing of the transverse components strongly affects \(M_{T}\). A bias of 17 events (2%) for 8\(\times\)8 tiles is observed for a degradation of the nominal \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\)resolution by 100%.

#### SM Cross Sections

The SM background comprises several processes whose cross sections have uncertainties. Since the tile fractions differ in general among these processes, the cross section uncertainties create systematic effects.10 Here only the dominant \(t\bar{t}\) (92%) and \(W\)+jets (7%) contributions are considered, to each of which is assigned a 50% cross section uncertainty, that are conservatively scaled in opposite directions. The shapes of the \(M_{T}\) and \(M_{\mathrm{eff}}\) distributions for \(t\bar{t}\) and \(W\)+jets are shown in Fig. 5. We find a bias of the order of 90 events (12%) for the 8\(\times\)8 configuration.

Footnote 10: Unless the SM background components are fitted separately, as described in Section 3.6.

#### Top Sample Composition

The composition of the \(t\bar{t}\) background is affected by systematic uncertainties in the simulation of the lepton identification and jet reconstruction efficiencies. It is studied in an approximative way, by varyingthe cross sections of the \(tt\to\ell\nu\ell\nu\) and \(tt\to\ell\nu qq\) processes in analogy to Section 3.7, because these two processes exhibit different shapes - in particular for \(M_{T}\) (see Fig. 5). We have applied relative cross section shifts of \(\pm 10\%\) to both processes in opposite directions. A bias of 33 events is observed for 8\(\times\)8 tiles, corresponding to a systematic error of 4%.

#### Summary of Systematic Uncertainties

The sources of systematic errors considered and their effects on the fitted signal yields for several SUSY benchmark models and for the tile configuration 8\(\times\)8 are summarised in Table 4. Separately listed are the biases due to signal correlations, which are model dependent. It is noticeable that for all SUSY models studied signal correlations lead to an underestimate of the signal yield.

The total error on the signal yield, including statistical fluctuations and systematic effects, can be computed by adding in quadrature all errors, or by repeating the fit with the systematic uncertainties added in form of penalty functions (cf. Section 3.4). We have compared both methods for the SUSY benchmark model SU3 and the 2\(\times\)2 tiles configuration. We find slightly reduced uncertainties for the

\begin{tabular}{l c c c c c c} \hline
8\(\times\)8 & SU1 & SU2 & SU3 & SU4 & SU6 & SU8 \\ \hline \(N_{\rm MC}^{\rm S}\) [events] & 423 & 75 & 768 & 6260 & 251 & 214 \\ \hline Statistical error & 8\% & 61\% & 6\% & 3\% & 12\% & 13\% \\ \hline JES & 8\% & 22\% & 8\% & 8\% & 10\% & 17\% \\ \(E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}\) resolution & 3\% & 16\% & 2\% & 2\% & 8\% & 2\% \\ SM cross sections & 15\% & 45\% & 12\% & 5\% & 18\% & 23\% \\ \(t\bar{t}\) sample comp. & 9\% & 34\% & 4\% & 3\% & 12\% & 5\% \\ \hline Bias due to signal corr & 6\% & 21\% & 7\% & 32\% & 9\% & 8\% \\ \hline \end{tabular}

Table 4: Relative systematic errors on the signal yield for 8\(\times\)8 tiles and various SUSY benchmark models. Also given are the statistical errors and the biases due to signal correlations obtained from toy experiments. Due to the nature of the systematic studies we have done, these numbers should not be taken as the final systematic uncertainties we would expect from this background estimation technique, but should give an idea of how sensitive the method is to some of the main systematic effects.

penalty approach. A decrease in error is expected since the fit will to some extent constrain the scale parameters for important systematic errors. The fitted values for \(N^{\rm S}\) remain constant on average in the fit with penalty functions.

It is noteworthy that the dominant systematic uncertainties arising from the SM cross sections and the relative top contributions can be included in the fit by splitting the SM components (cf. Section 3.6). However, such a fit requires more than 2\(\times\)2 tiles.

### Stability Test

The stability of the Tiles method can be studied by varying the \(M_{\rm eff}\) and \(M_{T}\) tile boundaries. Apart from statistical fluctuations, the results obtained should be independent of the positions of the boundaries. Inaccurate SM tile fractions and presence of signal correlations (if not corrected) break this invariance. We have studied variations in the \(M_{\rm eff}\) tile boundary for 2\(\times\)2 tiles with a single inclusive background component. Figure 6 shows the number of estimated SM background events in presence of SU3 (top plot) and SU4 signal (bottom plots) versus the \(M_{\rm eff}\) tile boundary. While SU3 exhibits a fairly uniform distribution reproducing the true result, significant deviations occur for SU4 (bottom left plot). After removing signal correlations a fair stability of the result is recovered (bottom right plot).

The estimated number of SM background events (filled/red squares) is plotted versus the \(M_{\rm eff}\) tile boundary for SU3 (top) and SU4 signal (bottom plots). The true value is indicated by the dotted line. The signal correlations are turned off for SU4 in the bottom right plot.

Conclusions

This note discusses a novel approach, denoted _Tiles method_, for the determination of the Standard Model (SM) background in the inclusive one-lepton SUSY search analysis. It takes into account correlations between the discriminating variables for the SM background (while assuming them to vanish for SUSY signal), and omits assumptions about the distribution of signal events, in particular no regions with signal or background dominance are assumed. It does however require input on the relative fractions of background events in the tiles from simulation (but not their overall normalisation).

In the Tiles Method the data are split up into \(n{\times}n\) tiles in the two-dimensional space spanned by the discriminating variables (\(M_{T}\), \(M_{\rm eff}\) for our studies). For \(n=2\) there is an exact solution for the number of signal events, for \(n>2\) the system is overconstrained and a maximum-likelihood fit is performed. In this case the quality of the fit provides information about how well the data are described by the model. For example, large signal correlations ignored in the likelihood model would show up as a poor fit quality. We have studied different tile configurations, and find that 8\(\times\)8 gives the best statistical power for an analysis of 1 fb\({}^{-1}\) of LHC data, and a typical mSUGRA model point.

This note targets mostly the presentation of the new method. Some of the details (number of tiles, best binning, inclusion of signal correlations, etc.) need to be studied further. Since the method relies on input from MC simulation we have case studied systematic effects that arise from differences between the simulation and the data. The study gives a qualitative impression of how sensitive the method is to these effects, whereas a full quantitative study requires calibration of simulation with real data via control samples. Only after these studies have been done (once data are available) will we be able to define the best tile configuration to be used in the analysis.

For \(n>2\) the Tiles method also allows to separately determine different SM background components using or not prior information on the relative cross sections from MC simulation. It reduces the systematic error from uncertainties on the background composition, which is currently the dominant systematic effect.

The Tiles method is a promising way to determine the background in a one-lepton SUSY analysis. It solves many of the problems seen with the \(M_{T}\) method - at the expense of an increased simulation dependence when more than 2\(\times\)2 Tiles are used to increase the statistical yield. Initial studies indicate that the systematics associated with this simulation dependence are under control - but further studies on this will be needed.
