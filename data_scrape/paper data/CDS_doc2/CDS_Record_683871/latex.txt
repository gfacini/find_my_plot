## 1 Introduction.

This paper describes the first part of a vibration problem study for the MDT Chamber. The reasons of this study are the results of the wire vibration test presented in the references 1. Particular values of the natural frequencies and resonant amplitudes for the tube and wire were obtained in this test. The analysis of these values permitted to conclude that the resonant wire vibration can spoil resolution of the drift tube.

The goals of this work were:

* Determination of the real value of the modal damping ratios1 for the drift tube finite element model (FEM);

Footnote 1: The damping ratios are a measure of the dissipation of the vibration energy.
* Making of the finite element analysis (FEA) for the MDT Chamber's single drift tube vibration.

## 2 Damping ratios determination.

### Test setup.

The 6 m long stainless steel tube with 30 mm outer diameter and wall thickness 0.5 mm is used for the test. 50 um gold plated tungsten wire is stretched with initial tension of 300 g and crimped in pins. The pins are inserted in the endplugs made of the polymethilmethacrylate.

The tube vibration is exited by vibrator attached to the tube near its end (Figure 1). The vibrator consists of the Al-alloy cylinder and electrical motor with eccentric rotor at the bottom of the cylinder. There is a load, which is fixed at the opposite end of the tube. The vibrator and the load are hung by rubber laces. The tube ends are placed on the vibrator and the load top. There is additional soft support in the middle of the tube.

An amplitude of the vibration is measured by microscope. There are three holes in the tube wall to see amplitudes of the first four wire resonances. The vibration amplitude of the tube and one of the vibrator were measured at the points marked by crosses in Figure 1.

All measurements were performed with Ar filling of the tube at the normal conditions.

### Finite Element Model.

3-D FEM for the drift tube vibration test setup was worked out to determine real value of the modal damping ratios for the drift tube (Figures 1).

Geometrical data of FEM:

\(\bullet\): Tube diameter -- 30mm;

\(\bullet\): Tube wall thickness -- 0.5mm;

\(\bullet\): Wire diameter -- 50um;

\(\bullet\): Vibrator diameter -- 120mm;

\(\bullet\): Vibrator length -- 240mm;

\(\bullet\): Load diameter -- 60mm;

\(\bullet\): Load length -- 600mm.

The element types used in FEM were:

\(\bullet\): STIF4 (2 nodes Elastic Beam) to model the tube, vibrator and load;

\(\bullet\): STIF8 (2 nodes Spar) to model the wire and rubber laces.

Four materials types were used in FEM:

\(\bullet\): Stainless steel to model tube;

\(\bullet\): Tungsten to model wire;

\(\bullet\): Aluminum alloy to model vibrator and load;

\(\bullet\): Rubber to model rubber laces.

The wire was stretched with force of 276g2. The vibration was simulated by pulsating force in Y direction. The amplitude of this force depended from frequency as follows:

Footnote 2: The value of this force was calculated for condition of the agreement between wire natural frequency for the vibration test and for FEM.

\(F=k\cdot f^{2}\)

Where:

\(F\) is pulsating force;

\(k=2\)e-3(N/Hz\({}^{2}\) ) is empirical coefficient depending from the vibrator performance data;

\(f\) is vibration frequency.

### Calculation results.

The damping ratios were empirically (with using of the data of the drift tube vibration test) being fitted for each drift tube's mode. After that, Damping Ratio versus Frequency relations was obtained (Figure 3). The shape of the damping curves allows us make deduction, that both \(-\) mass and structural damping are actual for the wire and only structural damping is actual for the tube. The experimental damping curves are approximated quite well by theoretical curves (Figure 3), that makes possible to use obtained relations for more wide range of the frequency.

In Table 1 the resonant amplitudes obtained by measurement and calculated with using of the theoretical damping ratios are shown.

In the process of the analysis it was explored following effect: if the value of the tube natural frequency is quite close to wire one (difference between natural frequences must be less than 0.5Hz), the wire resonance amplitude increases extremely. We named this effect \(-\) "Secondary resonance effect." The typical shape of the resonance curve, illustrating of this effect, is shown in Figure 4.

The series of the calculations were carried out to look into this effect. The results of the calculations are shown in Figures 6 and 6. Parameter P on the Figure 6 is the ratio of the wire resonant amplitude to the tube one. Df is the difference between wire natural frequence and tube one. The term "Wire-Tube" means that the wire resonance begins earlier than tube one. Correspondingly, "Tube-Wire" means that the tube resonance begins earlier than wire one.

Besides, it was established that Secondary resonance effect practically disappears when vibrator is attached to the end of tube. It means that a main way of the energy transmission between tube and wire is the lateral vibration3. However, some part of energy is transmitted by longitudinal vibration4. It is necessary to note, that it is impossible to remove this way of the energy transmission5.

Footnote 3: The wire resonant amplitude increases about 10 time for this way of the energy transmission.

Footnote 4: Longitudinal vibration arises as result of the tube length change in lateral vibration.

Footnote 5: The wire resonant amplitude increases on 20 - 50 percents for this way of the energy transmission.

## 3 MDT Chamber's single drift tube vibration.

### Finite Element Model.

3-D FEM for the 2.6 m long drift tube vibration was worked out (Figure 7). Scheme was carried out in manner of the vibration test one.

Geometrical data of FEM:

\(\bullet\): Tube diameter - 30mm;

\(\bullet\): Tube wall thickness - 0.4mm;

\(\bullet\): Wire diameter - 50\(\mu\)m;

Figure 7: Calculation scheme.

The element types used in FEM were:

* STIF4 (2 nodes Elastic Beam) to model the tube;
* STIF8 (2 nodes Spar) to model the wire.

Two materials types were used in FEM:

* Aluminum alloy to model tube;
* Tungsten to model wire;

The wire was stretched with force of 300g. The vibration source generating 1 \(\upmu\)m amplitude vibration in Y direction was attached to one end of the drift tube.

### 3.2 Calculation results.

The calculations with using of the damping ratios obtained during analysis of the drift tube vibration test setup were carried out. Four opening wire modes were taken into account in these calculations. The shapes of these modes are shown in Figure 8.

Figure 8: Shapes of the vibration modes.

The results of the calculations are given in Figure 9.

As it can be seen from Figure 9, the value of the first resonance amplitude considerably exceeds of the allowable wire displacement.

## 4 Discussion of the calculations results.

The obtained results of the drift tube vibration analysis may be considered only as first approach to the problem because of the following circumstances:

* The damping ratios, used in calculations, are obtained for stainless steel tube and for drift tube design having differences from the real drift tube design;
* The vibration amplitude values are obtained for the separate modes, but spectrum mode vibration will arise during real using of the muon chamber;
* The natural frequency of the muon chamber can turns out quite close to the wire natural frequency, that can lead to the considerable increasing of the wire vibration amplitude.

## 5 Conclusions.

* The value of the wire vibration amplitude can considerably exceed the allowable wire displacement;
* If the natural frequency of the muon chamber will turn out quite close to the wire natural frequency "Secondary resonance effect" can arise;
* To increase the precision of the calculation it is necessary to do following: 1. to determine the damping ratios for the real drift tube; 2. to determine the vibration spectrum for the real conditions of the muon chamber using.
