## Abstract

This note has to be considered as an update of note ATLAS PHYS-051 [1], in which the search for \(A\mathord{/}H\to\tau\tau\) decays was described.

The results reported in [1] and [2] were obtained from full simulation and reconstruction of \(gg(q\bar{q})\to A\mathord{/}H\to\tau\tau\) channel (direct production).

Since the dominant \({\rm A}\mathord{/}{\rm H}\) production process for large values of \(tan\beta\) is from \(b\bar{b}A\mathord{/}H\) (associated production), a dedicated study has been done for this channel, where main difference with respect to the direct production is the smaller \(<p_{T}>\) of the produced \(A\mathord{/}{\rm H}\).

A new combined analysis has been developped to optimize selection for the two production processes. The final sensitivity is comparable with the one given in [1].

A discussion of the study on \(Z\to\tau\tau\), that could be used to check the analysis procedure for the \(A\to\tau\tau\) channel, at the beginning of ATLAS operation, is also included.

After completing this note further studies were done for the ATLAS TDR [3]. Results presented in [3] are therefore the more up-to date.

Introduction

In the minimal supersymmetric extension of the Standard Model (MSSM), two Higgs doublets are required, resulting in 5 physical states, usually referred to as H\({}^{+}\), H\({}^{-}\), h (neutral lighter scalar), H (neutral heavier scalar) and A (neutral pseudoscalar ). At the tree level their masses can be computed in terms of only two parameters, typically \(m_{\rm A}\) and \(tan\beta\) (the ratio of the vacuum expectation values of the two doublets).

The parameter space of the MSSM, usually shown as extending over values

\(0<m_{\rm A}<500\) GeV and \(0<tan\beta\)\(<50\), can be explored through the \(A/H\) to \(\tau\tau\) decays.

The MSSM \({\rm H\to\tau\tau}\) A \({\rightarrow\tau\tau}\) rates are strongly enhanced with respect to the SM case over a large region of the parameter space. For low values of \(tan\beta\), the \(gg\to A/H\rightarrow\tau\tau\) rates are dominant and significantly larger than in SM case. For large values of \(tan\beta\), the production is dominated by \(b\overline{b}\) H and \(b\overline{b}\)\(A\), and the \({\rm H\to\tau\tau}\) rates are very similar to the A \({\rightarrow\tau\tau}\) ones.

For \(m_{\rm A}\)\(>150\) GeV, the H and A bosons are degenerate in mass, so the signal rates in the \(\tau\tau\)-channel can be added, whereas a more complicated procedure depending on the experimental resolution and on the mass difference \(m_{\rm H}\)-\(m_{\rm A}\) has to be applied for \(m_{\rm A}\)\(<150\) GeV. Higgs-boson masses below 100 GeV have not been considered in this channel because of the large resonant background from \({\rm Z\to\tau\tau}\) decays.

In the present note three mass points have been studied: \(m_{\rm A}\)=150, 300, 450 GeV. Fig. 1 shows how direct and associated \(A\) production rates (\(\sigma\times\) BR(\(\tau\tau\))) share the \(t\)_an\(\beta\) region for the mass points here studied: direct \(A\) production is dominant at low \(t\)_an\(\beta\)_ values while associated \(b\overline{b}\)\(A\) rate is dominant at high \(t\)_an\(\beta\) values and increases as the \(m_{\rm A}\) increases.

The inclusive production was already studied in [1] and [2]. The aim of the present note is the detailed study of the associated \(b\overline{b}\)\(A\) events to understand the kinematic differences between the two different production processes and to evaluate the best selection criteria for each of them. In fact it will be shown that the standard A \({\rightarrow\tau\tau}\) analysis [1] which has been optimized for events from direct \(A\) production and which is described briefly in the following section is not the optimal one for events from the associated production.

In section 3 the main differences between topology of events from direct and associated \(A\) productions are outlined, in section 4 the two different analyses for the two production processes are described, together with the method used to combine the results to estimate the final significance to this channel. In section 5 some technical details of the combined analysis are described.

Finally in section 6 a check of the \(m_{\tau\tau}\) reconstruction procedure using the \({\rm Z\to\tau\tau}\) events is reported in some details.

## 2 Standard \(\rm A\to\tau\tau\to lepton-hadron\) analysis

We recall here that in the \(\rm A\to\tau\tau\) decay the lepton-hadron channel (one of the \(\tau\)-lepton is required to decay leptonically to trigger the event, while the other one is required to decay to hadrons) turns out to provide the best sensitivity to a possible signal, due both to its larger rate (the fraction of \(\rm A\to\tau\tau\) giving a final lepton-hadron state is 46%) and to the more favorable kinematics of the \(\tau\)-decay.

Excellent \(\tau\)-identification performance to suppress the huge QCD-jet-backgrounds from various sources and excellent \(E_{T}^{miss}\)-resolution performance for the reconstruction of the \(\tau\tau\) mass are required from the detector for the \(\rm A\to\tau\tau\) channel study.

The analysis reported in [1] is based on a set of cuts, called 'Standard \(A\) cuts', that includes \(\tau\)-identification cuts (see [4] for all the details), kinematic cuts, and a cut on the reconstructed \(\tau\tau\) mass, whose resolution depends crucially on the \(p_{T}^{miss}\) resolution [5]. In fact the energies of the two \(\tau\)'s used for the \(m_{\tau\tau}\) calculation are evaluated from the energies of the \(\tau\) decay products, assumed to have the direction of the \(\tau\)-parent and the neutrino energies that are obtained solving a system containing the two \(p_{T}^{miss}\) components. The measurement uncertainties on \(p_{x}^{miss}\), \(p_{y}^{miss}\) combined with the assumption on the directions of the decay-products often result in unphysical solutions for the neutrino energies. In this case the \(A\) mass cannot be reconstructed.

In section 6 more details on the \(\tau\tau\) mass reconstruction are reported, together with a check of the global \(\tau\tau\) mass reconstruction procedure using \(\rm Z\to\tau\tau\) events.

* Standard \(A\) analysis :
* \(\tau\)-identification cuts:
* \(R_{em}\ <\ 0.07\), where \(R_{em}\) is the jet radius computed using only the e.m. cells contained in the jet;
* \(\Delta E_{T}^{12}\ <\ 0.1\), where \(\Delta E_{T}^{12}\) is the difference between the transverse energies contained in cones of size \(\Delta R=0.2\) and \(0.1\), normalised to the total jet transverse energy \(E_{T}\);
* \(N_{tr}\ =\ 1\), where \(N_{tr}\) is the number of reconstructed charged tracks with \(p_{T}>\ 2\) GeV pointing to the cluster.
* kinematic plus mass cuts:
* \(p_{T}^{lepton}\ >24\) GeV and \(|\eta|^{lepton}\ <\ 2.5\);
* Isolation of the trigger lepton, asking \(E_{T}<5\) GeV in a window of half-width=0.6 centered around the lepton, which rejects leptons from \(b\overline{b}\) by a factor 100 for a 90% efficiency for isolated leptons ;
* \(E_{T}^{jet}\ >40\) GeV, \(|\eta|^{jet}\ <\ 2.5\);
* \(1.8<\ \Delta\phi(jet-lepton\,on)\ <\ 2.9\). or \(3.4<\ \Delta\phi(jet-lepton)\ <4.5\) (against Z background);
* \(\rm m_{T}(lepton-p_{T}^{miss})\ <\ 25\ GeV\) (against backgrounds containing W);
* \(p_{T}^{miss}>18\) GeV;
* \(\rm m_{\tau\tau}\ =m_{A}\ \pm\ \Delta M\ \ (\Delta M=1.5\sigma_{\tau\tau})\)
Main topological differences between events from direct and associated \(A\) production

Two samples of signal events from direct and associated \(A\) production and the main backgrounds which are Z, \(t\overline{t}\), \(W+jets\) and \(b\overline{b}\) events have been fully simulated with the version DICE \(96-12\) of ATLAS simulation program. The statistics for fully simulated events is reported in Table 1.

Because of the low number of background events surviving all kinematic cuts reported in the previous section, a large sample of events has been produced using ATLAS. Note that in [6] it has been shown that there is a good agreement between full simulation and ATLFAST in kinematic cuts acceptance, \(p_{T}^{miss}\), jet and mass reconstruction. So an additional sample of 18000 \(W+jets\) events and of 3700 \(b\overline{b}\) events after the filter cuts reported in [1] has been used (they correspond to 200000 generated \(W+jets\) events and to 150000 generated \(b\overline{b}\) events). Finally 20000 \((\mbox{Z}/\gamma)^{*}\rightarrow\tau\tau\) events generated with \(\sqrt{\hat{s}}\) in each mass window of the three studied A mass points were simulated with ATLFAST. The \(b\overline{b}\)\(Z\) production channel has not been simulated for this study because of the low cross-section with respect to other background processes [7].

From the study of the signal events from direct and associated \(A\) production, one important difference has to be emphasized: in \(b\overline{b}A\) events the \(p_{T}\) of generated \(A\) is lower with respect to the direct \(A\) production and this difference increases as the \(m_{\rm A}\) increases. Fig. 2 shows that \(<p_{T}>\) of generated \(A\) in the associated \(b\overline{b}A\) production is 14% to 42% lower w.r.t. to direct production, the difference becoming relatively smaller and smaller as \(m_{\rm A}\) increases. This implies that in the \(b\overline{b}A\) events the two \(\tau\)'s from \(A\) tend to be more back to back, with two main consequences:

* 1) a lower acceptance of the \(\Delta\phi(jet-lepton)\) cut reported in the previous section, due to a narrower distribution of \(\Delta\phi(jet-lepton)\) around \(\pi\) with respect to direct \(A\) events. Fig. 3 shows the distributions of \(\Delta\phi(jet-lepton)\) for \(Z\) background and for direct and associated \(A\) for the three studied mass points. It can be seen that the \(\Delta\phi(jet-lepton)\) distribution of \(b\overline{b}A\) events is more similar to the one of \(Z\). The cut \(\Delta\phi(jet-lepton)<2.9\), \(\Delta\phi(jet-lepton)>3.4\) was optimized to discard \(Z\); so the acceptance of this cut on \(b\overline{b}A\) events is lower than the acceptance for direct \(A\) events by 25% to 40 %, as \(m_{\rm A}\) increases.
* 2) a worse resolution of the system giving the neutrino energies and consequently a lower acceptance of the mass cut with respect to direct \(A\) events.

Fig. 4 shows the reconstructed \(\tau\tau\) invariant masses of direct \(A\) and \(b\overline{b}A\) events for the three mass points studied after the cut on \(\Delta\phi(jet-le\mu\mu\)on) which allows to obtain the best mass resolution. It can be seen that in the \(b\overline{b}A\) events the \(\tau\tau\) invariant mass is wider by 10% to 50%, increasing with \(m_{\rm A}\) with respect to direct \(A\) events and moreover the number of events for which the mass system could not be solved increases by about 30%.

From these observations we can conclude that it is not optimal to apply the standard \(A\) analysis also to \(b\overline{b}A\) events because the acceptance after kinematic and mass cuts would be too low, about 40-50% lower with respect to the acceptance of direct \(A\) events.

## 4 Combined analysis for direct and associated

A \(\rightarrow\)\(\tau\tau\)

To optimize the analysis for the case where signal events are a mixture of events produced in the direct and \(b\overline{b}A\) production, two different analyses have been performed. The final sensitivity to the signal has been estimated as a statistical combination of the sensitivity to each of the two analyses. Both analyses are based mainly on the standard \(A\) analysis described above with the addition of some further requests.

* First analysis:
* 1 b-jet tagged (against \(Z\) and W+jets backgrounds).
* number of non b-jets \(<\) 3 (against \(t\overline{t}\) backgrounds).
* cuts of standard \(A\) analysis (\(\tau\)-identification, kinematic and mass cuts) except the cut on \(\Delta\phi(jet-lepton)\) which is no more necessary because it was optimized to eliminate Z \(\rightarrow\tau\tau\) events (\(b\overline{b}\)\(Z\) has a very low cross-section [7]).
* Second analysis:
* zero b-jet tagged (against \(t\overline{t}\) and \(b\overline{b}\) backgrounds).
* all cuts of standard \(A\) analysis (\(\tau\)-identification, kinematic and mass cuts).

In both analyses a b-tagging efficiency of 60%,with a rejection of 100 against other jets and of 10 against c-jets have been randomly applied.

Fig. 5, 6 and 7 show the number of b-jets and of non b-jets inside the detector acceptance before and after b-tagging respectively for \(b\overline{b}A\) signal, and for the main backgrounds.

The cuts applied in both analyses are very severe, due to the necessity of a very strong suppression of the backgrounds, so, as it can be seen in Table 4, the numbers of simulated events surviving all the cuts are very low.

Due to the opposite requests concerning the number of tagged b-jets, the samples passing selection of these two analyses are not correlated. So, after having applied them separately to both signal samples (direct and associated \(A\)) and to background events, it is possible to estimate the combined significance.

The combined significance is calculated in the following way:

\(\frac{|S^{1}(direct~{}A)+S^{1}(b\overline{b}A)|}{\sqrt{(B^{1})}}\oplus\frac{| S^{2}(direct~{}A)+S^{2}(b\overline{b}A)|}{\sqrt{(B^{2})}}\)

where:

\(S^{1}(direct~{}A)\), \(S^{2}(direct~{}A)\) = number of expected direct \(A\) events after the 1st and the 2nd analysis respectively.

\(S^{1}(b\bar{b}A)\), \(S^{2}(b\bar{b}A)=\) number of expected \(b\bar{b}A\) events after the 1st and the 2nd analysis respectively.

\(B^{1}\), \(B^{2}=\) number of expected background events after the 1st and the 2nd analysis respectively.

In Table 2 it is reported the number of expected events for direct \(A\), \(b\bar{b}A\) signals at \(tan\beta\)=10 and at \(tan\beta\)=25 and for backgrounds for an integrated luminosity of \(3*10^{4}\)\(pb^{-1}\) after having applied independently each of the two analyses.

The dominant backgrounds for the 1st analysis are W+jet and \(b\bar{b}\) events, while for the 2nd one the dominant background is W+jets, the Z background is important for the lowest mass point.

In the same Table the combined significance at \(tan\beta\)=10 and 25 is also reported: it can be seen that the main contribution to the combined significance at both \(tan\beta\) values is given by the first analysis.

In Fig. 8 and 9 the expected reconstructed masses for the signal for the three mass points studied and for background (obtained adding \(Z\), W+jet and \(b\bar{b}\)) for the first and the second analysis respectively at \(tan\beta\)=25 are shown after three years at low luminosity.

Table 3 shows the lower limits on \(tan\beta\) for observability of the signal, together with the upper limits on the errors. The \(tan\beta\) values are obtained asking for a combined significance of \(5\sigma\) for the three mass points studied in full simulation; the errors on \(tan\beta\) values are evaluated assuming an uncertainty of 100% on the number of surviving background events: this procedure has been adopted due to the very low numbers of background events that pass the cuts (see Table 4). It can be seen that for a double amount of background, the \(tan\beta\) values corresponding to \(5\sigma\) limit increase by about 20 %, while if the background tends to zero the \(tan\beta\) values improve by 40 % or more depending on \(m_{\rm A}\).

Table 3 shows also the \(tan\beta\) values obtained from the old full simulation [8] which did not take into account differences in the acceptance and mass resolution for the associated \(b\bar{b}A\) signal (more precisely what it was done in the past was to simulate only direct production events and to assume that the associated production events were kinematically similar to the direct ones).

The results obtained with the new combined analysis are somewhat worse at low mass with respect to the results obtained with the old inclusive analysis; this is due to the fact that previously some important characteristics of \(b\bar{b}A\) signal were neglected. The new results and the old ones are however still compatible within the errors. These results have to be considered still preliminary. 1

Footnote 1: More statistics was produced after this Note was completed. The final results are given in the ATLAS TDR[3].

In Fig. 10 the reconstructed \(\tau\tau\) masses for direct plus associated \(b\bar{b}A\) are represented at \(tan\beta\) values which corresponds to the 5 \(\sigma\) discovery limit. These plots have been obtained after the cut on \(\Delta\phi(jet-le\,p\kern-6.0pt\mu\,on)\) and weighting the number of direct and associated \(A\) events with the relative cross-sections.

Fig. 11 gives the ATLAS 5\(\sigma\)-discovery curves in the \((m_{\rm A},t\kern-1.0pt\alpha\beta)\) plane for all MSSM Higgs bosons signals for an integrated luminosity of \(3\cdot 10^{4}\) pb\({}^{-1}\)(taken from [8]); the points superimposed represent the new results reported in the present note.

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:8]

* \(\tau\)-identification cuts (as in Standard \(A^{0}\) analysis, see section 2)
* \({p_{T}}^{lepton}\ >16\) GeV and \(|\eta|^{lepton}\ <2.5\)
* \({E_{T}}^{jet}\ >30\) GeV, \(|\eta|^{jet}\ <2.5\)
* no b-jet tagged
* \(1.8<\ \Delta\phi(jet-lept\,on)\ <\ 2.7\). or \(3.6<\ \Delta\phi(jet-lept\,on)\ <\ 4.5\)
* \({\rm m}_{T}\,(lepton-p_{T}^{miss})\ <\ 50\ GeV\)
* \(66<\ m_{\tau\tau}\ <116\) GeV

it is possible to obtain the acceptances and the rates reported in Table 5, corresponding to \(\sim\)700 signal events in the mass bin with \(\sim 20\%\) of background after 30 days of data-taking.

We can observe that in this first cut set the \({p_{T}}^{lepton}\) and \({E_{T}}^{jet}\) cuts have been optimized to save as much \(Z^{0}\) statistics as possible. The cut on \(\ \Delta\phi(jet-lepton)\) is necessary to kill back-to-back events for which the neutrino system presents bad solutions corresponding to high reconstructed mass values (see Fig. 13).

To eliminate the events with badly reconstructed mass, instead of applying the \(\Delta\phi(jet-lepton)\) cut, it would be possible to cut the events with high \(p_{T}({\rm Z})\) values. In fact there is a strong correlation between \(p_{T}({\rm Z})\) and \(\ \Delta\phi(jet-lepton)\), as it can be seen in Fig. 14, but the \(\ \Delta\phi(jet-lepton)\) cuts really only the events with badly reconstructed mass, so it is more efficient.

After having applied the cuts reported above, the reconstructed Z mass results well centered on the nominal value with a resolution of about 9 GeV (see Fig. 15).

To obtain a lower background level in the mass bin it is possible to apply a stricter cut on the quantity \({\rm m}_{T}\,(lepton-p_{T}^{miss})\ (<25\) GeV) to kill W+jets and apply an additional cut: \(p_{T}^{miss}\ >18\) GeV against \(b\overline{b}\).

This new set of cuts reduces the background in the mass bin at a level of \(\sim 6\%\) and allows to obtain about 250 \(Z^{0}\) signal events after 30 days of data-taking; the corresponding acceptances and rates for signal and backgrounds are reported in Table 6.

## 7 Conclusions

* For large \(tan\beta\) values the \(A\) production is dominated by the \(b\overline{b}A\) production.
* direct \(A\) production events and \(b\overline{b}A\) events differ substantially in the \(p_{T}\) of the \(A\); that has a strong impact on the \(\Delta\phi\) between the two \(\tau\)'s.
* The 'Standard \(A\) analysis cuts' optimized in [1] for the direct production turn out not to be optimal for the events from associated production.
* two different analyses have been performed on each of the two \(A\) production channels and on the backgrounds and then combined: the present results on the final sensitivity are compatible, within the errors, with the results obtained in the past [1].

The expected \(5\sigma\)-discovery contour curves for the combined \(H/A\to\tau\tau\) signal show that, even for a moderate integrated luminosity of \(3\cdot 10^{4}\) pb\({}^{-1}\), a signal should be observed over a large region of the (\(m_{\rm A}\),\(tan\beta\)) plane.

Results at high luminosity operation, where there is a degradation of the detector performance, mainly in the \(p_{T}^{miss}\)resolution, will be reported in a separate note.

The results reported in this note have to be considered still preliminary. The results reported in the physics TDR will be obtained with the same procedure described here, but with increased statistics of simulated events.
