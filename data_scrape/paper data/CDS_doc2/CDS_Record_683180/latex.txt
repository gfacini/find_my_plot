## MDT Chamber Design - Forward Region

The MDT muon chambers in the forward region use the same general structural design as those in the barrel region, i.e. there are 2 multilayers of MDT's separated and supported by a spacer structure. The spacer consists of three transverse webs and 2 longitudinal beams. All in plane alignment hardware is precisely located on the spacer. The whole chamber is mounted to three points on the spacer structure. Because of geometrical differences between forward and barrel chambers, there are some structural differences:

All forward chambers are mounted with the multilayers in a vertical plane. Out of plane deflections are thus negligible and the pre-tensioning scheme is not needed.

Most of the forward chambers have a 450 mm overlap of multilayers in adjacent chambers. Thus, each chamber has 2 multilayers of different lengths.

The forward chambers have a trapezoidal shape.

The forward chambers are mounted in a very wide variety of ways and at many different angles. They thus need a large number of mount designs.

## Generic Forward Chamber Design ( Figure 1 )

The multilayers in the forward chambers are identical to those in the barrel except that the tube lengths vary across the multilayer. This has significant consequences for the multilayer assembly jigging discussed below. At each end of the multilayer, provision has to be made to provide all gas and electrical connections to the tubes, provide a Faraday cage and accommodate that part of the tube electronics which is mounted close to the tube ends. The exact nature of the end treatment of the multilayers depends on the choice of tube end plug technology. However, as one must precisely monitor the positions of the ends of the anode wires, it is necessary to provide a platform on which to mount the necessary monitoring hardware. This mounting surfaces on this platform must be precisely known by construction with respect to the wire ends. In the design shown here, this function is provided by the end rails. These are held precisely by the jigging during multilayer assembly. They can also serve as part of the gas manifolding. Mechanically, the end rails tie the ends of the tubes together to retain the precise tube to tube relations which are determined by the jigging during assembly.

The spacer structure is shown in Figure 2. Note that none of the alignment components or mounting hardware is shown. Holes for alignment lines of sight are not shown but can be easily provided for without any significant structural consequence. The spacer design for the forward chambers is based on that for the barrel chambers. FEA structural analysis for the forward chambers is in progress. The dimensions used for the forward chambers are, for the moment, based on FEA analysis done previously for the barrel chambers. The spacer design yields a very light structure which, when combined with the assembly procedures describedbelow, is also quite inexpensive. It requires a minimum of high precision machining. The structure relies on the high strength and rigidity of modern structural adhesives. The three cross webs hold the multilayers apart with a precise 250 mm spacing. This precision comes from the assembly process, not from precise machining of the webs. The webs also make the chamber structure very stiff in bending across the width of the chamber. They are bonded to the surfaces of the tube multilayers. The adhesive contact areas are large to minimize stresses. The two longitudinal beams are attached to the webs by simple angle brackets which have large areas for epoxy bonding. Note that these beams do not touch the tubes. FEA studies of the barrel chamber design showed that the sensitivity to temperature gradients of the chamber could be reduced be decoupling the large axial stiffness of the multilayers from the structure. This is done by reducing the thickness of two of the cross webs as shown in Figure 3, thus allowing axial expansion of the tubes with respect to the spacer.

Figure 4 shows the spacer attached to one multilayer and Figure 1 shows the complete assembly.

## Multilayer Assembly

The assembly methods used for the forward chamber multilayers are similar to those used for the barrel chambers. However, the trapezoidal shape of the chambers and the need to match the tube shape to the wire sag in the plane of the multilayer require significant changes in the assembly jigging. The Seattle group was assigned responsibility to evaluate multilayer assembly methods in which all 4 (or 3) tube layers are assembled at once. This implies that the top and bottom tube layers are located by precision jigging while the other layer(s) are located by the top and bottom tubes. Tests have been done on small tube arrays and these have led to the jig design described below.

The main precise parts of the jigging are the building blocks shown in Figure 5. These are used to make up a set of precision combs which locate points on the tubes. At the tube ends, the combs are angled to match the ends of the multilayer, with the combs being made up from the units shown in Figure 5(a). Other points on the tubes use straight combs made from the units in Figure 5(b). To obtain the best possible precision, all of the tube location surfaces are machined using a boring bar. This operation is the single most precise operation possible on a typical CNC milling machine. The blocks are held together using precise, press fit dowels with holes being bored in the same operation as the tube comb surfaces. All of these parts can be machined on typical 2-axis CNC mills available in most university or lab settings.

To keep the gravitational deflection of the combs negligible, each comb is bonded to a stiff box beam as shown in Figure 6. To ensure that the tube locations are in a plane, the comb is inverted and placed on an array of precise 30 mm dowels which is laid out on a surface table. The box beam is then bonded in place.

The base of the jig uses 2 steel I-beams, placed with normal survey precision and grouted to the floor. The first (lower) set of combs is mounted to these beams, each comb using 3 precision jacks to allow precise alignment of the combs. The alignment process is described below in detail. A number of the optical alignment components are left permanently in place to monitor any changes in the comb positions. Particular attention is given to the two end combs and the middle one as these provide the tube locations at the points of wire support. The complete jig is shown in Figure 7. The end blocks on each comb define the multilayer width and are easily moved to any position across the comb. They are located directly to the comb by precision 30 mm diameter dowels as shown. The set of dowels protruding from the outer surface of the end combs provide a precise locating surface for the multilayer end rail.

The first assembly stage is to place the two bottom end rails on the end combs. The jig is then filled layer by layer with complete, functioning MDT's with epoxy being applied at all tube to tube contacts. The end rails are also bonded to the tubes at this time. Figure 8 shows the completion of this stage. The two upper end rails are now bonded in place and another, identical set of combs is mounted on top of the side blocks as shown in Figure 9. These combs are located precisely with respect to the bottom combs by the side blocks and thus provide a precision location of the top layer of tubes. This complete multilayer is allowed to cure for 8 hours - it is then rigid enough to allow the next stage of chamber assembly to proceed.

## Chamber Assembly

Chamber assembly is done by first constructing the spacer/support directly onto the just completed small multilayer before the latter is removed from the jig. This completed sub-assembly is allowed to cure, removed from the jig and set aside. The large multilayer is then assembled in the same way as the small and allowed to cure. The small multilayer with the spacer/support is then inverted and put on top of the large multilayer. It is held in place precisely by the jig while it cures.

The key parts of the spacer/support are the three cross webs. In the completed chamber, it is these which hold the two multilayers in the required precise relationship to each other. This is done by the jigging and the assembly technique, not by the inherent precision of the webs which are made to be somewhat smaller than the actual distance between the multilayers. The small gap between the cross webs and the multilayer is filled by the epoxy adhesive.

The attachment of the spacer/support structure begins once the adhesive in the small multilayer has cured. First, the top combs are removed. The complete multilayer is still well constrained by the remaining jigging. To assemble the spacer/support each web is attached by dowels to a pair of precision side supports. As shown in Figure 10 these supports then sit on the end blocks which are still on the lower jig combs. The supports have a set of precisely bored surfaces which engage the dowels on the end blocks. An identical set of surfaces at the top of the side supports is located at a precise distance from the bottom surfaces and is used later when the large multilayer is attached as described below.

The side supports hold each cross-web just above the multilayer, with epoxy between web and tubes. The longitudinal beams require no precision at all and are just bonded to the websusing angle brackets (Figure 2). The in-plane alignment components are attached at this stage along with the chamber mounts. When the assembly has cured, the zero points of each alignment line are recorded while all is still in the jig and is, by definition, flat. The sub-assembly is then removed from the jig. Note that the side supports remain attached to the spacer/support.

The large multilayer is now built in the same way as above. An extra set of combs, shown in Figure 11, is placed and aligned outboard from what were the end combs used for the small multilayer. The small multilayer's end combs will be required for the final assembly stage and must not be moved at this time.

Once the large multilayer has cured, the first sub-assembly is inverted and placed on the jig as shown in Figure 12. The top surfaces of each side support (which are now facing down) are located by the side blocks and combs which were used during assembly of the small multilayer and the spacer/support. The height of each side support is precisely known by construction so that the two multilayers are held apart by the required distance and are precisely aligned relative to each other. The cross webs are now slightly above the tubes of the large multilayer with epoxy filling the gap. Once cured, the side supports are removed and the complete chamber assembly can be removed from the jig for installation of electronics and gas systems.

## Assembly Jigging Alignment

The jigging described in the previous sections will require five precisely aligned bottom combs. These are called principal combs. All bottom combs must lie in a plane and the grooves in each comb be aligned so that the tubes will acquire the appropriate curvature. In this section we describe the process by which this is achieved. The general description is given in terms of aligning the grooves to be straight. Later we describe how we obtain the required curvature. The intermediate combs which provide support between the wire locator points do not require the precision of the principal combs; however, in the alignment procedure described here, those combs will be initially aligned to approximately the same precision.

Figure 13 shows a general plan view of the principal combs; the dotted rectangles represent the support structure on which the combs rest. The individual combs are designated by letters, points on the combs by numbers. Combs **b**, **c**, and **d** are the critical locators for assembly of the small multilayer; **a**, **c**, **e** for the large multilayer. All five are critical in assembling the chamber and calibrating the on-module alignment system.

We begin by describing the alignment of **b**, **c**, and **d**. The x, y and z coordinates of point 3 are arbitrary. The x coordinate of 7 is chosen to fit the nominal size of the multilayer. The y and z coordinates of 7 are arbitrary. The x coordinate of 5 is fixed midway between those of 3 and 7. The y and z coordinates of 5 are adjusted so that 3, 5, and 7 lie on a straight line.

That line becomes the chamber base line (CBL). The y coordinate of 6 is fixed by the length of comb **c** and the coordinate of 5. The x coordinate of 6 is obtained by adjusting the yaw angle of **c** to align the comb grooves to be parallel to CBL. The z coordinate of 6 is chosen arbitrarily. The positions of 3, 6, and 7 establish the base plane for the multilayers and of the chamber. The x and y coordinates of 4 and 8 are obtained by adjusting the yaw angles of **b** and **d** to align their grooves with the CBL. The z coordinate of 4 is established by making 4 and 7 and a point near the middle of **c** colinear in the z coordinate. The z coordinate of 8 is established by making 4, 6, and 8 co-linear.

The combs **b**, **c**, and **d**, once aligned in this manner, provide the coordinate reference frame for all that follows. The combs **a** and **e** are aligned to **b**, **c**, and **d** by 1 with 3 and 5, 2 with 4 and 6, 9 with 5 and 7, and 10 with 6 and 8. A similar procedure is used to align any intermediate combs placed between **b** and **d**.

In the current alignment procedure we plan to use Rasniks to measure and jacks to adjust the appropriate coordinates as described above. The Rasnik system is left in place on the principal combs during the assembly procedure and continuously monitored. Each Rasnik system consisting of camera, lens and source, each mechanically referenced to the combs. Rasnik systems monitor points (1, 3, 5), (2, 4, 6), (5, 7, 9), (6, 9, 8) \(\ldots\) during the assembly process.

Each comb is supported by crossjacks at three points shown in Figure 14 as 1, 2, and 3.

Each crossjack constrains and adjusts the comb in two coordinates as shown in Figure 15.

The three crossjacks in combination provide a full kinematic support with all coordinates adjustable.

As a final step the combs must be adjusted so that the tubes acquire the curvature of the wires. This is accomplished by displacing and rotating the outside combs by calculated amounts so that the tubes best conform to the wires. Any intermediate combs are similarly adjusted
