In the theoretical framework of the Left-Right Symmetric Model, we report on the discovery potential for new charged gauge bosons (\(W_{R}^{+}\) and \(W_{R}^{-}\)) as well as right-handed Majorana neutrinos (\(N_{l}\)) at the future LHC. The \(pp\to W_{R}\to lN_{l}\) signals have been simulated in the ATLAS detector. Discovery contours in the \((m_{W_{R}},m_{N_{e}})\) plane as well as a study of polarization effects are presented.

Introduction

In spite of the remarkable agreement of the Standard Model (SM) with the current experimental data, too many fundamental questions have not been satisfactorily answered yet. For instance, parity violation in the weak interactions is introduced by hand and neutrinos are massless despite the fact that they are almost treated in the same way as the other elementary matter particles. However, in accordance with the recent experimental data in the field of atmospheric neutrino oscillations [1], there is a growing evidence that neutrinos should have very small masses. This suggests that the SM is not the ultimate theory of fundamental interactions. New data in unexplored sectors are thus needed in order to search for new phenomena that could pave the way to a deeper understanding of the neutrino mass issue. An alternative theory, the Left-Right Symmetric Model (LRSM) [2], restores the parity symmetry at high energy by extending the \(SU(2)_{L}\otimes U(1)_{Y}\) electroweak gauge group of the SM to \(SU(2)_{L}\otimes SU(2)_{R}\otimes U(1)_{B-L}\) and thereby introducing three new heavy gauge bosons: \(W_{R}^{+}\), \(W_{R}^{-}\) and \(Z^{\prime}\). If neutrinos are treated as Majorana particles, the LRSM, together with the See-Saw mechanism [3], may also provide an explanation for the lightness of the three left-handed neutrinos (\(\nu_{l}\)'s) at the cost of introducing three heavy right-handed neutrinos (\(N_{l}\)'s).

Up to now, no evidence has been experimentally found for the production of \(W_{R}\) and \(Z^{\prime}\). The limits, which are set by direct searches at the Tevatron, are \(m_{Z^{\prime}}~{}>~{}630~{}{\rm GeV/c^{2}}\)[4] and \(m_{W_{R}}~{}>~{}720~{}{\rm GeV/c^{2}}\) if the right-handed neutrinos are light or \(m_{W_{R}}~{}>~{}640~{}{\rm GeV/c^{2}}\) if the right-handed neutrinos are heavy (but still lighter than 410 \({\rm GeV/c^{2}}\)) [5]. The best indirect limits on the \(W_{R}\) mass come from the search for neutrinoless double beta decays, which could be induced by the exchange of \(W_{R}\)'s and \(N_{e}\)'s [6], and the analysis of the contribution of the right-handed currents to the \(K_{L}^{0}\)-\(K_{S}^{0}\) mass difference [7]. A theoretical analysis of the vacuum stability performed in [8] indicates that the right-handed Majorana neutrinos are lighter than the \(W_{R}\) boson. Also, in some supersymmetric extensions of the LRSM, a theoretical upper limit of a few \({\rm TeV/c^{2}}\) for the mass of the new right-handed charged boson was derived in [9], which suggests that the \(W_{R}\) and \(Z^{\prime}\) bosons, together with the right-handed Majorana neutrinos, could be observed at future hadron colliders, in particular at LHC (\(\sqrt{s}~{}=~{}14~{}{\rm TeV}\)).

In Sec. II, we show that the \(pp\to W_{R}\to lN_{l}\) channel is by far the most promising one for the observation of right-handed Majorana neutrinos at LHC. In Sec. III, the overall geometry and the main performances of the ATLAS detector are described. Then, in Sec. IV, the discovery potential of \(pp\to W_{R}\to eN_{e}\) in ATLAS is estimated and, in Sec. V, a study of observable polarization effects is performed. Finally, a summary and conclusions are given in Sec. VI.

Production and decays of right-handed Majorana neutrinos

Two kinds of processes involving the LRSM gauge bosons and the right-handed Majorana neutrinos can be investigated at LHC [10]: \(pp\to W_{R}\to lN_{l}\) and \(pp\to Z^{\prime}\to N_{l}N_{l}\). In the most general case, the cross sections and the discovery limits of these processes depend on the following parameters:

* the value of the coupling constant \(g_{R}\) as well as the Cabbibo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) matrix for the right-handed sector,
* the \(W_{R}-W_{L}\) and \(Z^{\prime}-Z\) mixing angles,
* the masses of the three additional neutrinos \(m_{N_{l}}\).

For the sake of simplicity, the study presented in this paper is based on a model without mixing and where the right-handed fermions have the same CKM matrix and coupling constant as the left-handed fermions (\(g_{R}=g_{L}\)). Given the Higgs sector of the LRSM with Majorana masses for the neutrinos, this latter assumption indicates that \(Z^{\prime}\) is about 1.7 times heavier than \(W_{R}\). As for the right-handed Majorana neutrinos, we assume \(m_{N_{e}}=m_{N_{\mu}}=m_{N_{\tau}}\), which allows restriction of the number of additional parameters to two: \(m_{W_{R}}\) and \(m_{N}\).

The PYTHIA 5.7 and JETSET 7.4 [11] Monte-Carlo programs have been used to generate \(pp\to W_{R}\to lN_{l}\) and \(pp\to Z^{\prime}\to N_{l}N_{l}\) events. The default version of the codes had to be modified, in order to use the appropriate vector and axial fermion-boson couplings and in order to include the right-handed Majorana neutrinos with all their possible decay modes.

The total production cross sections of the \(W_{R}\) and \(Z^{\prime}\) bosons are calculated with the PYTHIA event generator:

\[\sigma_{tot}=\int\!\!\int f_{1}(x_{1},Q^{2})f_{2}(x_{2},Q^{2})\tilde{\sigma}(x _{1}x_{2}s)\,dx_{1}\,dx_{2}.\]

Here, \(f_{1}(x_{1},Q^{2})\) and \(f_{2}(x_{2},Q^{2})\) are the CTEQ2L parton distribution functions (\(Q^{2}\) must satisfy \(Q^{2}\simeq x_{1}x_{2}s\)), while \(\tilde{\sigma}(x_{1}x_{2}s)\) is the \(W_{R}\) or \(Z^{\prime}\) production cross section for the partonic interaction (no K-factor is included in this calculation).

Knowing how the branching ratios of the various decays of the \(W_{R}\) and \(Z^{\prime}\) bosons depend on the mass of the right-handed Majorana neutrinos, we computed the production cross sections for \(pp\to W_{R}\to lN_{l}\) and \(pp\to Z^{\prime}\to N_{l}N_{l}\) as a function of the masses of the bosons (\(m_{W_{R}}\) or \(m_{Z^{\prime}}\)) and the mass of the right-handed Majorana neutrinos (or rather \(r_{W}=m_{N}/m_{W_{R}}\) and \(r_{Z}=m_{N}/m_{Z^{\prime}}\)), as shown in Fig. 1. It is clear that the most promising channels for an observation of right-handed Majorana neutrinos are the ones involving the \(W_{R}\) boson: since \(m_{Z^{\prime}}\simeq 1.7\,m_{W_{R}}\), the production cross section for \(pp\to W_{R}\to lN_{l}\) is between one and two orders of magnitude higher than for \(pp\to Z^{\prime}\to N_{l}N_{l}\). Consequently, the study presented here is only dedicated to the search for \(W_{R}\) and \(N_{l}\).

Let us focus on the fractions of \(W_{R}\) bosons produced with a positive or a negative charge. Table 1 shows how their values, computed using PYTHIA, depend on \(m_{W_{R}}\). A first order analytical calculation can be performed to check their validity. On average, we can consider that the \(W_{R}\) bosons are produced at rest, so one gets \(x=x_{1}=x_{2}=m_{W_{R}}/\sqrt{s}\). As the main processes involved in the production of \(W_{R}\) are \(u\bar{d}\to W_{R}^{+}\) and \(\bar{u}d\to W_{R}^{-}\), the production cross sections for \(W_{R}^{+}\) and \(W_{R}^{-}\) are roughly proportional to \(f_{u}(x)f_{\bar{d}}(x)\) and \(f_{\bar{u}}(x)f_{d}(x)\), respectively. The relative contributions of \(f_{u}(x)f_{\bar{d}}(x)\) and \(f_{\bar{u}}(x)f_{d}(x)\) to the production cross section of the \(W_{R}\) bosons are shown in Fig. 2: they are in good agreement with the fractions of \(pp\to W_{R}^{+}\) and \(pp\to W_{R}^{-}\) events given in Table 1.

A right-handed Majorana neutrino \(N_{l}\) is assumed to decay promptly into a charged lepton \(l^{\pm}\) and an off-shell \(W_{R}^{*}\) boson which only decays into \(q_{i}\bar{q}_{j}\). As a result, the \(pp\to W_{R}\to lN_{l}\) decay chain leads to a final state with \(llqq\) (see Fig 3). In the following, the charged lepton \(l\) will only be an electron (or a positron) and, apart from Sec. 4.3, we will no longer consider the decay chains which involve muons and/or taus. This is partially justified by the fact that the best energy resolution for high-\(p_{T}\) leptons is obtained with the electromagnetic calorimeter rather than with the muon spectrometer.

## 3 Description of the ATLAS detector

The ATLAS experiment consists of four major subsystems which are: a central inner detector [12] with a solenoidal magnetic field of 2 T [13], a lead-liquid argon sampling electromagnetic calorimeter with an accordion geometry [14], a hadronic calorimeter made with iron and scintillating tiles in the regions where the radiation level is low enough [15] and made with lead and liquid argon elsewhere [14], a muon spectrometer [16] with a toroidal magnetic field [17]. More details about the expected performance of ATLAS can be found in [18]. Starting from the output of PYTHIA, the detector response was simulated with the ATLFAST 1.57 code [19]. In this analysis we are mainly interested in the reconstruction of electrons and hadronic jets.

First, the transverse energies of all stable particles (except neutrinos and muons) are summed in calorimeter cells of a given granularity \(\Delta\eta\times\Delta\phi\) (0.1 \(\times\) 0.1 for \(|\eta|<\) 3 and 0.2 \(\times\) 0.2 for \(|\eta|>\) 3). Then, clusters are defined in decreasing order of \(E_{T}\), by adding all the cells in a cone of radius \(\Delta R=\sqrt{\Delta\eta^{2}+\Delta\phi^{2}}=0.4\) around the cell with highest \(E_{T}\).

When a cluster matches a generated electron passing the selection criteria (\(p_{T}>5\) GeV/c and \(|\eta|<2.5\)) with \(\Delta R<0.1\), it is tagged as an electron and isolation cuts are applied: the electron must be separated by \(\Delta R>0.4\) from other clusters, the difference between the transverse energy collected in a cone of radius \(\Delta R=0.2\) around the electron and the transverse energy of the original electron should not exceed 10 GeV. The energy of an isolated electron is then smeared by using the expected energy resolution of the electromagnetic calorimeter, which is:

\[\frac{\sigma(E)}{E}=\frac{12\%}{\sqrt{E}}\oplus\frac{\sigma_{noise}}{E_{T}} \oplus 0.7\%,\]

where the noise coefficient \(\sigma_{noise}\) is parametrised as in [20].

The electron identification efficiency was assumed to be 100%, so our results are slightly optimistic, since an efficiency of about 90% is expected. The probability of misidentifying the charge sign of the electrons has been implemented to the default version of the program. The wrong sign assignment fraction is 1.4% for \(p_{T}=500\) GeV/c and 13.3% for \(p_{T}=2\) TeV/c [12].

When a cluster is not identified as an electron or a photon, it is classified as a jet. Its energy is smeared according to a Gaussian distribution whose parameters are given by:

\[\frac{\sigma(E)}{E} = \frac{50\%}{\sqrt{E}}\oplus 3\%\mbox{ for }|\eta|<3,\] \[\frac{100\%}{\sqrt{E}}\oplus 7\%\mbox{ for }|\eta|>3.\]

At high luminosity (\(10^{34}\) cm\({}^{-2}\)s\({}^{-1}\)), a pile-up noise term is added in quadrature (\(\sigma_{pile-up}\) is 7.5 GeV for a cone of radius \(\Delta R~{}=~{}0.4\)). Then, to correct for the jet energy leakage, the following calibration factors are used:

* for light quark jets: \[E_{T}^{real}=E_{T}\times\left(1.030+(0.0693E_{T}+0.155)^{-1.50}\right),\]
* for \(b\)-jets: \[E_{T}^{real}=E_{T}\times\left(1.054+(0.0541E_{T}+0.160)^{-1.37}\right).\]

Jets are identified as \(b\)-jets if a \(b\)-quark of \(p_{T}>5\) GeV/c is within a cone radius of 0.2 around the direction of the jet. For \(b\)-tagging efficiencies and rejection factors, a 53% global efficiency and a 91% global rejection of non \(b\)-jets are assumed.

Estimation of the discovery potential for the \(W_{R}\) boson and the right-handed Majorana neutrinos

### Event selection

Only a fraction of the \(pp\to W_{R}\to eN_{e}\to eejj\) events will be detected in ATLAS. For \(m_{W_{R}}\) = 2 TeV/c\({}^{2}\), the numbers of isolated electrons and hadronic jets are summarised in Table 2 for various values of \(r_{W}\). For low values of \(r_{W}\), one can notice that more than half of the events have a number of isolated electrons which is smaller than two: the lighter \(N_{e}\) when compared to \(W_{R}\), the higher its kinetic energy, which makes it difficult to separate its decay products in the detector. Also the number of hadronic jets is generally higher than two, mainly because of the gluons which are radiated by the quarks coming from \(N_{e}\) decays. In the following, we will select events with two isolated electrons and at least two hadronic jets in the final state and we will assume that the two leading jets come from \(N_{e}\). The corresponding overall efficiency is also given in Table 2.

Once this event selection is applied, the boson \(W_{R}\) can be easily reconstructed by using the invariant mass of the (\(e_{1}e_{2}j_{1}j_{2}\)) system. As for the reconstruction of \(N_{e}\), the two possible (\(ej_{1}j_{2}\)) combinations must be examined, because we do not know a priori if a given electron comes from \(N_{e}\) or \(W_{R}\).

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|c c c c c c|} \hline \multicolumn{7}{|c|}{\(m_{W_{R}}\) = 2 TeV/c\({}^{2}\)} \\ \multicolumn{7}{|c|}{Number of} & \multicolumn{3}{|c|}{Fraction of the events when \(r_{W}\) is} \\ \multicolumn{7}{|c|}{isolated electrons} & 0.1 & 0.3 & 0.5 & 0.7 & 0.9 \\ \hline \(n_{e}=0\) & 3.6\% & 1.1\% & 0.8\% & 1.1\% & 1.4\% \\ \(n_{e}=1\) & 49.2\% & 19.5\% & 14.6\% & 13.9\% & 16.1\% \\ \(n_{e}=2\) & 47.1\% & 77.5\% & 81.9\% & 81.9\% & 79.8\% \\ \(n_{e}=3\) & 0.1\% & 1.9\% & 2.7\% & 3.1\% & 2.7\% \\ \multicolumn{7}{|c|}{Number of} & & & & \\ \multicolumn{7}{|c|}{hadronic jets} \\ \hline \(n_{j}=1\) & 7.1\% & 0.7\% & 0.3\% & 0.2\% & 0.1\% \\ \(n_{j}=2\) & 24.1\% & 13.2\% & 9.9\% & 8.7\% & 7.2\% \\ \(n_{j}\geq 3\) & 68.8\% & 86.1\% & 89.8\% & 91.1\% & 92.7\% \\ \hline \multicolumn{7}{|c|}{Overall efficiency for} & & & \\ \(n_{e}=2\) and \(n_{j}\geq 2\) & 41.1\% & 76.8\% & 81.6\% & 81.7\% & 79.8\% \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}

### Reduction of the physics background

All physics processes which lead to two isolated electrons and at least two hadronic jets in the final state are potential sources of background. The following SM processes are considered:

\[pp\rightarrow\left\{\begin{array}{c}W^{+}W^{-},\ ZW^{\pm},\ ZZ\\ t\bar{t}\to W^{+}W^{-}b\bar{b}\\ Z/\gamma^{*}\end{array}\right\}+\mbox{jets}\to ee+\mbox{jets}+...\]

The two electrons come from either a \(Z\) or a \(W^{+}W^{-}\) pair, directly or via \(\tau\rightarrow\nu_{\tau}\nu_{e}e\). Thus, they always carry opposite-sign electric charges. Furthermore, their transverse energies are rather limited, which is also true for the two selected hadronic jets (see Fig. 4). As a comparison, the signal observables are displayed in Fig. 5 for \(m_{W_{R}}\) = 2 TeV/c\({}^{2}\) and \(m_{N_{e}}\) = 1 TeV/c\({}^{2}\).

In order to reduce the background without lowering too much the signal statistics, the following cuts are applied:

* both \(j_{1}\) and \(j_{2}\) must have a transverse energy greater than 100 GeV,
* the invariant mass of the \((ee)\) system must be greater than 200 GeV/c\({}^{2}\).

Only 0.25% of the background events which passed the event selection on the numbers of isolated electrons and hadronic jets survive these cuts: the corresponding rate is 12470 background events per year of LHC running at high luminosity (\(10^{34}\) cm\({}^{-2}\)s\({}^{-1}\)) and 94% of them come from a \(t\bar{t}\) pair production.

Shown in Fig. 6 are the mass spectra of the two \((ej_{1}j_{2})\) and the \((e_{1}e_{2}j_{1}j_{2})\) systems, for both the signal (with \(m_{W_{R}}\) = 2 TeV/c\({}^{2}\), \(m_{N_{e}}\) = 1 TeV/c\({}^{2}\)) and the background. The distributions are not symmetric around the \(N_{e}\) and \(W_{R}\) peaks, because of the final state radiation of gluons. To account for this effect, we have chosen to further select the events which pass the following criteria:

\[\begin{array}{c}0.7m_{N_{e}}\leq m_{inv}(e_{1}j_{1}j_{2})\mbox{ or }m_{inv}(e_{2}j_{1}j_{2})\leq 1.1m_{N_{e}},\\ (0.9-0.2r_{W})m_{W_{R}}\leq m_{inv}(e_{1}e_{2}j_{1}j_{2})\leq 1.1m_{W_{R}}.\end{array}\]

For a given value of \(m_{W_{R}}\), the SM background relative contribution increases when \(r_{W}\) gets closer to 1, as it is shown in Fig. 7. Several solutions have been investigated in order to solve this problem and bring the SM background down to a negligible level:

* select final states with same-sign electrons only: the signal loss is about 50%,
* use more severe cuts on \(m_{inv}(ee)\), \(E_{T}(j_{1})\) and \(E_{T}(j_{2})\): the higher \(m_{W_{R}}\) and \(m_{N_{e}}\), the smaller the signal loss.

### Discovery potential for \(W_{r}\) and \(N_{e}\) in ATLAS

In order to determine the sensitivity of ATLAS in terms of \(W_{R}\) and \(N_{e}\) masses, we proceed as follows. For both signal and background processes, we apply a cut at 200 GeV/c\({}^{2}\) on the invariant mass of the \((ee)\) system and a cut at 100 GeV on the transverse energies of the two jets with highest \(E_{T}\). Then, we compare the number of signal events \(S\) which pass the selection criteria for both \(m_{inv}(e_{1/2}j_{1}j_{2})\) and \(m_{inv}(e_{1}e_{2}j_{1}j_{2})\) to the corresponding number of background events \(B\). For a discovery, one must have at least 10 signal events and the signal must exceed five statistical fluctuations of the physics background (\(S/\sqrt{B}\geq 5\)) in the selected mass window.

After three years of data-taking at low luminosity (30 fb\({}^{-1}\)), the \(pp\to W_{R}\to eN_{e}\to eejj\) channel allows discovery of \(W_{R}\) and \(N_{e}\) up to masses of 4.6 and 2.8 TeV/c\({}^{2}\), respectively. After three years of data-taking at high luminosity (300 fb\({}^{-1}\)), these limits can be pushed up to 5.8 and 3.4 TeV/c\({}^{2}\), respectively (see Fig. 8.a). With more severe cuts, the sensitivity to \(N_{e}\) increases, because the SM background is suppressed for the values of \(r_{W}\) close to 1, while the sensitivity to \(W_{R}\) slightly decreases (see Fig. 8.b and Fig. 8.c).

Some improvements are possible in order to further enhance the sensitivity of ATLAS to \(W_{R}\) and \(N_{e}\) for the low values of \(r_{W}\). In this latter case, the decay products of the right-handed Majorana neutrino are difficult to separate in the detector: the electron coming from \(N_{e}\) is usually not isolated. So, one should rather search for final states with one high-\(p_{T}\) isolated electron and one high-\(p_{T}\) hadronic jet having a large electromagnetic component and matching a single high-\(p_{T}\) track in the inner detector. As the ATLFAST program classifies non-isolated leptons as hadronic jets, it does not allow such cases to be treated. So, we first search for the electron coming from \(N_{e}\) at the generator level and we look for the closest hadronic jet (referred to as \(j_{0}\)) in the ATLFAST output. Then, after selecting events with only one isolated electron (referred to as \(e_{0}\)), we combine \(e_{0}\) and \(j_{0}\), demanding that their transverse energies are greater than 1 TeV, in order to reconstruct \(W_{R}\) (no background event survives these cuts). The discovery potential associated to these final states is shown in open circles in Fig. 9, while the discovery potential corresponding to the final states with two isolated electrons and two jets is shown in full circles (\(L_{int}\) = 300 fb\({}^{-1}\)).

The search for \(pp\to W_{R}\rightarrow\mu N_{\mu}\) signals can also be used to increase the sensitivity of ATLAS. As the muon energy is measured in a magnetic spectrometer, the mass resolution for the reconstructed \(W_{R}\) and \(N_{\mu}\) is worse than in the case of \(pp\to W_{R}\to eN_{e}\). Nevertheless, it is likely to enhance the sensitivity to the \(W_{R}\) boson and the right-handed Majorana neutrinos, as shown in Fig. 9.

Polarization effects in the production and the leptonic decays of the \(W_{R}\) boson

Polarization effects, which appear both in the production and the leptonic decays of \(W_{R}\) bosons, have also been studied. For this purpose, we assume that the two partons involved in the production of the bosons carry a negligible transverse momentum so that, at first order, the \(W_{R}\) bosons can only be longitudinally polarized. Thus, the rapidity of the \(W_{R}\) boson (further referred to as \(y\)) is easy to derive from the beam momentum fractions:

\[E=(x_{1}+x_{2})\frac{\sqrt{s}}{2}\ \mbox{and}\ p_{z}=(x_{1}-x_{2})\frac{\sqrt{s}} {2}\Longrightarrow\ y=\frac{1}{2}ln\left(\frac{E+p_{z}}{E-p_{z}}\right)=\frac{ 1}{2}ln\left(\frac{x_{1}}{x_{2}}\right).\]

In the \(W_{R}\) rest frame, an electron \(e^{-}\) (\(e^{+}\)) is preferentially emitted parallel (anti-parallel) with respect to the spin of the boson. If \(\theta^{*}\) is defined as the angle of the electron with respect to the direction of one of the proton beams in the \(W_{R}\) centre of mass, one has [21]:

* for \(W_{R}^{+}\to l^{+}N_{l}\): \[\frac{d^{2}\sigma}{dy\,dcos\theta^{*}} \propto f_{u}(x_{1})f_{d}(x_{2})(1-cos\theta^{*})^{2}+f_{u}(x_{2})f_{d} (x_{1})(1+cos\theta^{*})^{2},\]
* for \(W_{R}^{-}\to l^{-}N_{l}\): \[\frac{d^{2}\sigma}{dy\,dcos\theta^{*}} \propto f_{d}(x_{1})f_{\bar{u}}(x_{2})(1+cos\theta^{*})^{2}+f_{d}(x_{2})f _{\bar{u}}(x_{1})(1-cos\theta^{*})^{2}.\]

If \(x_{1}\) and \(x_{2}\) are such that \(x_{1}x_{2}s\simeq m_{W_{R}}^{2}\), then the fractions of \(W_{R}^{+}\) and \(W_{R}^{-}\) bosons produced in the +1 and -1 helicity states are:

* \(X_{S_{z}=+1}^{W_{R}^{+}}\propto\int_{\frac{m_{W_{R}}}{\sqrt{s}}}^{1}f_{u}(x)f _{\bar{d}}\left(\frac{m_{W_{R}}^{2}}{xs}\right)dx,\)
* \(X_{S_{z}=-1}^{W_{R}^{+}}\propto\int_{\frac{m_{W_{R}}}{\sqrt{s}}}^{1}f_{u}\left( \frac{m_{W_{R}}^{2}}{xs}\right)f_{\bar{d}}(x)\,dx,\)
* \(X_{S_{z}=+1}^{W_{R}^{-}}\propto\int_{\frac{m_{W_{R}}}{\sqrt{s}}}^{1}f_{d}(x) f_{\bar{u}}\left(\frac{m_{W_{R}}^{2}}{xs}\right)dx,\)
* \(X_{S_{z}=-1}^{W_{R}^{-}}\propto\int_{\frac{m_{W_{R}}}{\sqrt{s}}}^{1}f_{d} \left(\frac{m_{W_{R}}^{2}}{xs}\right)f_{\bar{u}}(x)\,dx.\)

For a given rapidity \(y\), let \(F(y)\) and \(B(y)\) be the number of events with \(cos\theta^{*}>0\) and \(cos\theta^{*}<0\), respectively. Then, \(X_{S_{z}=+1}^{W_{R}^{\pm}}\) and \(X_{S_{z}=-1}^{W_{R}^{\pm}}\) can be calculated using:

\[X_{S_{z}=+1}^{W_{R}^{\pm}}+X_{S_{z}=-1}^{W_{R}^{\pm}} = 1,\] \[X_{S_{z}=+1}^{W_{R}^{\pm}}-X_{S_{z}=-1}^{W_{R}^{\pm}} = \frac{4}{3}\times|A_{FB}(W_{R}^{\pm})|,\]where \(A_{FB}=\frac{\int_{y>0}(F(y)-B(y))dy-\int_{y<0}(F(y)-B(y))dy}{ \int_{y>0}(F(y)+B(y))dy+\int_{y<0}(F(y)+B(y))dy}\).

By using PYTHIA with \(m_{W_{R}}\) = 2 TeV/c\({}^{2}\), one finds that \(X_{S_{z}=+1}\) is roughly equal to 77% for \(W_{R}^{+}\) and 71% for \(W_{R}^{-}\) at the event generator level.

One should thus wonder if it is still possible to measure these values after reconstructing the \(pp\to W_{R}\to eN_{e}\) events in ATLAS. Only final states with two isolated electrons and two hadronic jets are used here and the cuts that have been applied to suppress the background are: \(m_{inv}(ee)>200\) GeV/c\({}^{2}\), \(E_{T}(j_{1})\) and \(E_{T}(j_{2})>100\) GeV and charge(\(e_{1}\))=charge(\(e_{2}\)). To measure the polarization effects at the detector level, we proceed as follows.

1. To reduce the effect of the final state radiation of gluons on the invariant mass distributions, we apply the following correction before reconstructing \(W_{R}\) and \(N_{e}\):

\[\left(\begin{array}{c}\vec{p}_{j_{1}}+\vec{p}_{j_{2}}\\ E_{j_{1}}+E_{j_{2}}\end{array}\right)_{corr}\ =\ \left(\begin{array}{c}\vec{p}_{j_{1}}+\vec{p}_{j_{2}}\\ E_{j_{1}}+E_{j_{2}}\end{array}\right)+\sum_{k}\left(\begin{array}{c}\vec{p}_ {j_{k}}\\ E_{j_{k}}\end{array}\right)_{\Delta R(j_{k})\leq 1.0},\]

where \(\Delta R(j_{k})=\mbox{Min}\left(\sqrt{(\eta_{j_{k}}-\eta_{j_{i}})^{2}+(\phi_{ j_{k}}-\phi_{j_{i}})^{2}}\right)\) with \(i\) = 1, 2.

2. To determine the origin of the electrons, we calculate \(\delta m(e_{i})=|m_{N_{e}}^{rec}-m_{inv}(e_{i}j_{1}j_{2})|\) (with \(i\) = 1, 2) and we assume that the electron with the smallest \(\delta m\) comes from the right-handed Majorana neutrino.

3. To measure the fraction of \(W_{R}^{\pm}\) candidates in the +1 helicity state, we use the forward-backward asymmetry \(A_{FB}(W_{R}^{\pm})\) and the following formula:

\[X_{S_{z}=+1}^{W_{R}^{\pm}}=\frac{1}{2}\left(1+\frac{4}{3}|A_{FB}(W_{R}^{\pm})| \right).\]

The results obtained at the end of this procedure for \(m_{W_{R}}\) = 2 TeV/c\({}^{2}\) and for various values of \(r_{W}\) have been reported in full circles in Fig. 10. Shown in open circles are the fractions of reconstructed \(W_{R}^{\pm}\) bosons in the +1 helicity state with the assumption of a perfect identification of the charge and the origin of the electrons. When \(r_{W}\) gets close to 0.75, we can consider in a very rough approximation that \(m_{W_{R}}\) is equally distributed among the two electrons and the two quarks coming from \(W_{R}\to eN_{e}\to eeq_{i}\bar{q}_{j}\). As a result, the \((e_{1}j_{1}j_{2})\) and \((e_{2}j_{1}j_{2})\) systems are more likely to have invariant masses with similar values when \(r_{W}\simeq 0.75\) than in the other cases, making thus more difficult the identification of the origin of each electron and the correct measurement of polarization effects.

## 6 Summary and conclusions

We have reported on the discovery potential of a charged \(W_{R}\) gauge boson and right-handed Majorana neutrinos, as predicted by the minimal Left-Right Symmetric Model,in the ATLAS detector. For an integrated luminosity of 300 fb\({}^{-1}\), \(N_{e}\) could be observed together with the \(W_{R}\) boson, if \(m_{N_{e}}\) and \(m_{W_{R}}\) are smaller than 4 and 6 TeV/c\({}^{2}\), respectively. To give an example of other physics observables which could characterise such a process, we have performed a study of the polarization effects involved in the production and the leptonic decay of the \(W_{R}\) bosons and we have shown that it is possible to measure them with the ATLAS detector.
