Introduction

This report describes in detail the most recent evaluations of rates for signal and background processes in the Higgs sector of one of the possible extensions of the Standard Model (SM), the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM). Such supersymmetric extensions of the SM require that the mass scale of the supersymmetric partners of ordinary particles be not significantly larger than the scale for electroweak symmetry breaking. The LHC has a crucial role to play in either uncovering or excluding such extensions to the SM.

To perform a systematic study of the Higgs sector of the MSSM one has to deal with a rich spectrum of possible signals. The Higgs sector contains two charged (H\({}^{\pm}\)) and three neutral (h, H, A) physical states. At the tree level, all Higgs boson masses and couplings can be expressed in terms of two parameters only, for example \(m_{A}\), the mass of the CP-odd boson, and tan \(\beta\), the ratio of the vacuum expectation values of the Higgs doublets. A complete study is therefore more complicated than in the SM, where the only free parameter in the Higgs sector is the Higgs mass. In addition, when considering production and decay of Higgs bosons, the whole particle spectrum of the model has to be taken into account, since the R-odd particles (squarks, sleptons, gauginos, higgsinos) can also play an important role. Nevertheless, the MSSM model has a high degree of predictivity. In particular, the radiative corrections to the masses and couplings of the Higgs bosons can be kept under control. The production cross-sections and decay branching ratios for the MSSM Higgs bosons can be readily computed in perturbation theory. The production or decay processes that correspond to the tree-level diagrams can be obtained from the corresponding formulae for the SM Higgs boson (e.g. see [1] for a summary) by simply multiplying the various amplitudes by the appropriate supersymmetric correction factors. For processes that are described by loop diagrams, however, one has to include in the MSSM model some contributions that are absent in the SM case.

Since the submission of the ATLAS TP [2], much has changed in the overall picture of the MSSM Higgs sector2. In particular, more complete theoretical calculations are now available, and, more importantly, considerable work was done in the analysis of the MSSM Higgs sector. This includes a more or less automatic procedure to produce the contour curves in the (\(m_{A}\), tan \(\beta\)) and (\(m_{h}\), tan \(\beta\)) planes and the analysis of channels not considered at the time of the TP (e.g. \(\mathrm{H}\to\mathrm{h}\mathrm{h}\), \(\mathrm{H}/\mathrm{A}\to\mathrm{t}\mathrm{\overline{t}}\) and \(\mathrm{A}\to\mathrm{Z}\mathrm{h}\)).

Footnote 2: The analysis of the MSSM Higgs sector performed at the time of the TP is documented as a draft part of [3] in the ATLAS physics directory on WWW. This draft note can be considered as complementary in part to this one, since most of the figures for the branching ratios and cross-sections are presented there in a different way.

In the study presented here, two-loop calculations are used for the masses and couplings [4], as well as one-loop calculations [5] for some decay branching ratios (\(\mathrm{H}\to\mathrm{h}\)). Following the approach of [6], QCD corrections are partially taken into account by including running quark masses in the calculations of branching ratios, and it is assumed that all supersymmetric particles are heavy enough not to play an important role in the phenomenology of MSSM Higgs boson decays. In addition, negligible mixing in the stop and sbottom mass matrices is assumed, and the higgsino mass parameter \(|\mu|\) is assumed to be negligible in comparison with the SUSY scale. This scenario corresponds to a fairly pessimistic discovery scenario for the LHC, since these choices for the additional MSSM parameters give the lowest possible upper limit for \(m_{h}\), which reduces the LHC potential for h-boson discovery in the h \(\to\gamma\gamma\) channel, but also suppresses the h \(\to\) ZZ\({}^{(*)}\to 4\ell\) channel.

The main uncertainty in the predictions for the MSSM Higgs sector arises from the present experimental uncertainty of \(\sim~{}\pm\) 15 GeV [7] on the top-quark mass \(m_{t}\). In contrast to the SM case, the MSSM Higgs sector is quite sensitive to the value of \(m_{t}\). For a consistent comparison with studies performed for LEP2 [8], a central value of \(m_{t}=175\) GeV is used throughout this note, and results are also shown for more extreme values of 150 and 200 GeV. Wherever relevant, results of the simulations performed for the SM Higgs sector and documented in [3] are used for comparison. If not explicitly stated otherwise, physics processes, including initial- and final-state radiation, hadronisation, and decays, were simulated using PYTHIA 5.7 [10] at \(\sqrt{s}=14\) TeV and with its default set of structure function parametrisations. However, large uncertainties in the signal and background production cross-sections remain, due to higher-order corrections, structure function parametrisations, as well as the models used for full event generation. In addition, despite the existence of many higher-order QCD correction (K-factor) calculations, not all processes of interest at the LHC (in particular background processes) have benefited from this theoretical effort. Therefore, the present studies have consistently and conservatively avoided the use of K-factors, resorting to lowest-order predictions for both signals and backgrounds.

The results presented here come predominantly from particle-level simulations. However, most of the crucial detector-dependent performance figures, such as the mass resolutions, reconstruction/identification efficiencies and background rejections, were obtained using full simulations of the ATLAS detector, and used as inputs to the analysis of signal and background rates presented here.

The systematic studies presented in this report allow definite conclusions to be drawn concerning the ATLAS discovery potential over the whole \((m_{A},\tan\beta)\) and \((m_{h},\tan\beta)\) parameter space. They also cover a rich spectrum of experimental signatures, thus providing a good benchmark to study the flexibility and robustness of the ATLAS detector to discover new physics. It should be nevertheless stressed that the present results should be treated with some caution. Theoretical and experimental uncertainties may change the positions of discovery curves in a significant way; the dominant theoretical ones are:* the top-quark mass \(m_{\rm t}\),
* the MSSM parameters,
* the mass spectrum of SUSY particles,
* the K-factor corrections to signal and background production,
* the structure function parametrisations,
* the higher-order radiative corrections to the MSSM Higgs boson masses and couplings.

This note is organised as follows: Sections 2 and 3 quantify the general properties of the MSSM model; in particular, the relations between the various Higgs boson masses, couplings, widths, production cross-sections and branching ratios are discussed as well as the expected rates at the LHC for the interesting channels. Special emphasis is given to the variations of the predictions as a function of \(m_{\rm t}\) and the MSSM parameters, \(m_{\rm A}\) and \(\tan\beta\). For decay channels accessible in the SM Higgs sector, SM predictions are also shown, in order to shed light on the differences or similarities between the two models. Section 4 describes the semi-automatic procedure used to produce the \(5\sigma\)-discovery contour curves in the MSSM parameter space. Section 5 discusses the observability of different decay channels, summarising in a systematic way the signal and background rates as well as the expected significances at low and high luminosities. Numbers are quoted for a few mass values for each decay channel. The \(5\sigma\)-discovery contour curves are presented for each decay channel in the \((m_{\rm A},\tan\beta)\) and \((m_{\rm h},\tan\beta)\) planes, for the three values of \(m_{\rm t}\) given above and for three values of the integrated luminosity. Section 6 summarises the results of this study, showing the global \(5\sigma\)- discovery contour curves, and also drawing some conclusions on the comparison with LEP2, and on the ATLAS potential to disentangle between SM and MSSM. For completeness, global \(5\sigma\)-discovery contour curves are also shown for the combined ATLAS and CMS detectors. In Appendices A to E, the simulation framework and the recent work on channels not studied at the time of the TP are described in more detail.

## 2 Masses, couplings and widths

### MSSM Higgs boson masses and couplings

In the MSSM, the Higgs sector [1] contains two charged physical states \(({\rm H}^{\pm})\) and three neutral ones \(({\rm h},\,{\rm H},\,{\rm A})\). At the tree level, all Higgs boson masses and couplings can be expressed in terms of two parameters only, for example \(m_{A}\) and \(\tan\beta\). The following relations can be used:

\[m_{H,h}^{\,2} = \frac{1}{2}[m_{A}^{\,2}+m_{Z}^{\,2}\pm\sqrt{(m_{A}^{\,2}+m_{Z}^{ \,2})^{2}-4m_{A}^{\,2}m_{Z}^{\,2}\cos^{2}2\beta}\ ] \tag{1}\] \[m_{H^{\,\pm}}^{\,2} = m_{W}^{\,2}+m_{A}^{\,2} \tag{2}\]

The mixing angle \(\alpha\)\((-\frac{\pi}{2}<\alpha<0)\) required to diagonalise the Higgs mass matrix is given by the following expression:

\[\cos 2\alpha=-\cos 2\beta\ \ \frac{m_{A}^{2}-m_{Z}^{2}}{m_{H}^{2}-m_{h}^{2}}. \tag{3}\]

The couplings for the neutral Higgs bosons to fermions and massive gauge bosons are easily obtained 3 from the SM Higgs couplings, shown in Table 1, if one multiplies them by the \(\alpha\)- and \(\beta\)-dependent factors summarised in Table 2.

Footnote 3: The complete set of Feynman rules for the MSSM Higgs sector can be found in [1].

These tree-level formulae for the Higgs-boson masses and couplings are however subject to large radiative corrections, dominated by the exchange of virtual top and bottom quarks and squarks in the loop diagrams. They introduce a dependence on the top and squark masses and on the mixing in the stop-sbottom mass matrices into the formulae for the Higgs masses and couplings (see e.g. [5]). In particular, the largest possible value of \(m_{h}\) is significantly larger than \(m_{Z}\) for \(m_{t}>150\) GeV.

When considering MSSM Higgs boson production and decay, the most important part of these radiative corrections is taken into account by using corrected formulae for the mass matrix and then determining \(\alpha\) from the input parameters. Couplings to fermions/gauge bosons can still be expressed in terms of the fermion/gauge boson masses and of the angles \(\beta\) and \(\alpha\). The leading radiative corrections can thus be taken into account by using the corrected expression for \(\alpha\) and the running fermion masses, evaluated at the

When making numerical calculations, this note always uses a universal soft supersymmetry-breaking squark mass \(M_{SUSY}=m_{Q}=m_{U}=m_{D}=m_{\tilde{q}}=1\) TeV, always assumes that all SUSY particle masses are at 1 TeV, that the mixing in the stop and sbottom mass matrices is negligible, i.e. that: \(A_{t}=A_{b}=0\), and that the value of the Higgsino-mass term \(|\mu|\) is much smaller than \(M_{SUSY}\).

### Tree-level, one-loop and two-loop calculations

Over the last few years, different methods for computing the radiative corrections to the Higgs mass spectrum have been developed, see e.g. [8] for more details. The effect of these radiative corrections is significant for the light Higgs mass \(m_{h}\), shifting upwards its maximum value by as much as \(\sim 50\) GeV with respect to the tree-level predictions. This effect is even larger when including only one-loop radiative corrections, but is reduced if the dominant terms of the two-loop corrections are taken into account. In the following, results from calculations including one-loop radiative corrections in the Effective Potential Approach [5], as given by the code of [6], are compared to to those including a Renormalisation Group improvement of the Effective Potential at one loop as well as the dominant two-loop effects [4].

Fig. 1 shows \(m_{h}\) as a function of \(m_{A}\) for tree-level (dots), one-loop (dashed line) and two-loop (solid line) calculations, for different values of tan \(\beta\) and for \(m_{t}=175\) GeV. The value of \(m_{h}\) depends very little on \(m_{A}\) for \(m_{A}>200\) GeV and reaches its maximum allowed value for \(m_{A}>200\) GeV and \(\tan\beta>10\). The effect of the radiative corrections is significant, leading to an increase of this maximum allowed value of 30-40 GeV (for \(m_{t}=175\) GeV) with respect to the tree-level predictions. The one-loop calculations [5] used at the time of the TP overestimate, for the same set of MSSM parameters, the maximum allowed value of \(m_{h}\) by about 10 GeV with respect to the more recent two-loop calculations [4].

In the case of \(m_{H}\), the dependence on \(m_{A}\) is nearly linear, as shown in Fig. 2, with \(m_{H}\sim m_{A}\) for large \(m_{A}\) and the effect of radiative corrections is noticeable only for small \(m_{A}\) (\(m_{A}<200\) GeV), leading to an increase of 10-20%. If tan \(\beta\) increases from 3 to 30, the minimum allowed value of \(m_{H}\) decreases by about 10 GeV, from \(m_{H}=123\) GeV to \(m_{H}=113\) GeV, and is reached for \(m_{A}<110\) GeV and tan \(\beta>10\). For the charged Higgs H\({}^{\pm}\) the effect of the radiative corrections is small and \(m_{H^{\pm}}\) increases only slightly with tan \(\beta\), by 5-10 GeV when tan \(\beta\) increases from 3 to 30.

The dependence of the coupling \(\cos 2\alpha\) on \(m_{A}\) is shown in Fig. 3 for different values of tan \(\beta\). For large values of \(m_{A}\) and tan \(\beta\), \(\cos 2\alpha\) is very close to unity and does not depend on the radiative corrections. For smaller values of tan \(\beta\) or \(m_{A}\) the two-loop predictions lie between the tree-level and one-loop ones (similarly to \(m_{h}\)). The numerical values of the correction factors to the h- and H-boson couplings shown in Table 2 have to be changed correspondingly, as explained above.

Figure 1: _Tree-level (dots), one-loop (dashed) and two-loop (solid) predictions for \(m_{\rm h}\) as a function of \(m_{\rm A}\) for four values of \(\tan\beta\) and for \(m_{\rm t}=175\GeV\)._

### Dependence of \(m_{\rm h}\) and \(m_{\rm H}\) on \(m_{\rm t}\)

Another consequence of these radiative corrections is that the expressions for \(m_{\rm h}\) and \(m_{\rm H}\) now depend on \(m_{\rm t}\). In particular, the maximum allowed value of \(m_{\rm h}\) is shifted upwards by a factor proportional to the fourth power of \(m_{\rm t}\). This explains why the tree-level predictions for \(m_{\rm h}\) are considerably affected by the radiative corrections for large values of \(m_{\rm t}\). For \(m_{\rm t}=150\), 175 and 200 GeV and \(\tan\beta=3\) and 30, the two-loop numerical values of the MSSM Higgs-boson masses are given as a function of \(m_{\rm A}\) in Tables 3 and 4 for \(m_{\rm h}\), Tables 5 and 6 for \(m_{\rm H}\) and Tables 7 and 8 for \(m_{\rm H^{\pm}}\).

Table 7: _For tan \(\beta\) = 3 and \(m_{t}\) = 150, 175, and 200 GeV, dependence of \(m_{H\pm}\) on \(m_{A}\)._When \(m_{t}\) increases from 150 to 200 GeV, the maximum allowed value of \(m_{h}\) increases by 25 GeV. On the other hand, the dependence of \(m_{H}\) on \(m_{t}\) is very weak and limited to small values of \(m_{A}\) (\(m_{A}<200\) GeV ). The charged Higgs mass depends very weakly on both tan \(\beta\) and \(m_{t}\), and changes by less than 1 GeV when \(m_{t}\) increases from 150 to 200 GeV.

### Dependence of \(m_{h}\) on the MSSM parameters

The dependence of the maximum allowed value of \(m_{h}\) on the other MSSM parameters has been recently discussed in [8]. For the usual choice of SUSY scale \(M_{SUSY}~{}=~{}1\) TeV, a few choices for the values of the higgsino mass parameter \(\mu\) and the soft SUSY breaking parameter, \(A_{t}~{}=~{}A_{b}~{}=~{}A\), have been studied. In particular, it has been shown that the maximum allowed value of \(m_{h}\), for scenarios with negligible mixing, \(A~{}\sim~{}|\mu|~{}\ll~{}M_{SUSY}\), is lower than for scenarios with maximal mixing, \(A~{}=~{}\sqrt{6}~{}M_{SUSY}\), \(|\mu|~{}\ll~{}M_{SUSY}\), by about 30 GeV.

This difference is very similar in magnitude to the one quoted above, if \(m_{t}\) varies from 150 to 200 GeV. This reprot will therefore be limited to a study of the impact of variations of \(m_{t}\) on the expected sensitivity to the MSSM Higgs sector, and this impact will be considered as typical of what one might expect for variations of \(\mu\) and \(A\). More complete theoretical calculations are now available for studying directly, the dependence, not only upon \(\mu\) and \(A\), but also upon \(M_{SUSY}\) and more generally upon the SUSY particle mass spectrum (see the conclusions for a further discussion of the interplay between the MSSM Higgs sector and the supersymmetric particle sector).

### The h and H couplings to fermions and gauge bosons

Fig. 4 presents the correction factors to the MSSM h-boson couplings relative to the SM couplings to fermions and massive gauge bosons (see Table 2) as a function of \(m_{A}\) (left side) and of \(m_{h}\) (right side), for \(m_{t}\) = 175 GeV and for different values of \(\tan\beta\). For large values of \(\tan\beta\), the couplings to down-type quarks and leptons are strongly enhanced, while those to up-type quarks and massive gauge bosons are suppressed. All correction factors tend towards unity for large \(m_{A}\), but this effect is slower in the case of the enhanced couplings to down-type quarks and leptons than in the case of the suppressed couplings. For large values of \(m_{A}\) and \(\tan\beta\), the h-boson couplings therefore tend towards the SM Higgs couplings. The plateau observed over a large range of \(m_{A}\) values on the left side of Fig. 4 is mapped onto a very small interval of \(m_{h}\) values on the right side of Fig. 4. This will most often result in a very steep behaviour of h-boson production and decay rates for values of \(m_{h}\) near the maximum allowed value.

Fig. 5 presents the same correction factors for the H-boson couplings. In contrast to the case of the h-boson, the couplings of the MSSM H-bosonto down-type quarks and leptons are strongly enhanced with respect to the SM couplings over a large region of the parameter space (\(\tan\beta>10\) and \(m_{\rm A}>100\) GeV). Over this region, the couplings of the H-boson to up-type quarks are strongly suppressed; those to massive gauge bosons are even more strongly suppressed, for all values of \(\tan\beta\) and for almost all values of \(m_{\rm A}\) (\(m_{\rm A}>120\) GeV).

### Higgs boson widths

The total decay widths of the MSSM Higgs bosons all differ significantly from that of a SM Higgs boson of the same mass. Tables 9 to 12 show how these widths vary as a function of mass and of \(\tan\beta\), for \(m_{\rm t}=175\) GeV and for \(h\), H, A and \(\rm H^{\pm}\) respectively. For comparison, the corresponding width of a SM Higgs boson of the same mass is also given.

The decay width of the h-boson is usually larger than that of a SM Higgs boson of the same mass, and increases significantly with \(\tan\beta\), up to \(\sim 5\) GeV for \(\tan\beta=50\). However, even for large values of \(\tan\beta\), the h-boson decay width tends towards the SM Higgs boson width, as the h-boson mass tends towards its maximum allowed value. As shown in Table 4, the region where \(m_{\rm h}\) is close to its maximum allowed value maps onto most of the relevant parameter space in the (\(m_{\rm A}\), \(\tan\beta\)) plane. As a consequence, the h-boson width will always be much smaller than the experimental resolutions for the signatures accessible at the LHC.

The decay widths of the H-boson and A-boson are very similar for \(m_{\rm H}=m_{\rm A}\). They become large, 3 to 25 GeV, for large values of \(m_{\rm H}\), \(m_{\rm A}\) and of \(\tan\beta\), and will have to be taken into account, when studying the channels accessible in this region of parameter space (\(\rm H/A\to\tau\tau\) and \(\mu\mu\)). For small values of \(\tan\beta\), where the channel \(\rm H\to ZZ^{(\star)}\to 4\ell\) is accessible for \(m_{\rm H}<2m_{\rm t}\), the H-boson width is much smaller than that of the SM Higgs boson of the same mass.

Finally, Table 12 shows that the decay width of the charged Higgs boson is small, less than \(\sim 1\) GeV, for all values of \(\tan\beta\) and for \(m_{\rm H^{\pm}}<m_{\rm t}\).

## 3 Branching ratios, cross-sections and rates

### h-boson

The h-boson is the lightest of the MSSM Higgs bosons. As discussed in Section 2, the mass range of interest is from \(m_{\rm h}\sim 70\) GeV (good overlap with LEP2) to the maximum allowed value of 100 to 130 GeV, depending on \(m_{\rm t}\). Over this mass range, the SM Higgs boson can only be discovered through \({\rm H}\to\gamma\gamma\) and \({\rm H}\to{\rm b}{\overline{\rm b}}\) decays. Since the h-boson couplings approach the SM Higgs couplings over most of the (\(m_{\rm A}\), \(\tan\beta\)) parameter space, it is natural to explore the same decay channels for the h-boson as for the SM Higgs boson.

#### 3.1.1 Branching ratios

The \({\rm h}\to\gamma\gamma\) decay is governed by loops of fermions, gauge bosons, charged Higgs bosons, sfermions and charginos. As discussed in Section 2 and shown in Fig. 4, the relevant couplings vary very fast for low values of \(m_{\rm A}\). In particular, the coupling to \(W\)-boson pairs, which dominates the SM \({\rm H}\to\gamma\gamma\) decays, is strongly suppressed for small values of \(m_{\rm A}\). Fig. 6 shows how the \({\rm h}\to\gamma\gamma\) branching ratio varies as a function of \(m_{\rm h}\) and \(m_{\rm A}\) for different values of \(\tan\beta\) and \(m_{\rm t}\). The branching ratio varies rapidly as a function of \(m_{\rm h}\), reaching the SM value as \(m_{\rm h}\) reaches its maximum allowed value. This reflects directly the variation of the h-boson couplings to massive gauge bosons as a function of \(m_{\rm h}\) shown in Fig. 4, where the rise is also seen to be steeper for larger values of \(\tan\beta\).

The \({\rm h}\to\gamma\gamma\) branching ratio only slowly increases as a function of \(m_{\rm A}\), since \(m_{\rm h}\) varies very slowly as a function of \(m_{\rm A}\), and reaches the SM value for large \(m_{\rm A}\)4. This is due to the slow saturation of the \(\tau\tau\) and \({\rm b}{\overline{\rm b}}\) decay widths, whereas the \(\gamma\gamma\) decay width is already saturated. The dependence on \(m_{\rm t}\) reflects only the variation of the maximum allowed values of \(m_{\rm h}\) as \(m_{\rm t}\) varies.

Footnote 4: Fig. 6 shows the maximum branching ratio value per mass bin and not the average.

The dominant \({\rm h}\to{\rm b}{\overline{\rm b}}\) branching ratio is shown in a similar way in Fig. 7. It varies only slowly as a function of the parameters, and is slightly enhanced with respect to the SM \({\rm H}\to{\rm b}{\overline{\rm b}}\) branching ratio, for large values of \(\tan\beta\) and not too large values of \(m_{\rm A}\), due to the enhanced couplings to down-type quarks (see Fig. 4).

The figures on the left also show the SM predictions (dotted lines)._

#### 3.1.2 Production cross-sections

As discussed in detail in [3] for the SM Higgs boson, several processes contribute to Higgs-boson production. The h-boson production cross-sections are calculated for five subprocesses: \(gg\to h\), \(qq\to qqh\) (\(WW_{fus},ZZ_{fus}\)), bbh, \(q\bar{q}\to Wh\) and tth. In a first step, the relevant cross-sections are computed using PYTHIA 5.7; in a second step they are multiplied by the appropriate correction factors (in particular, the contributions to \(gg\to h\) production from stop, sbottom and charged Higgs loops are included, using the calculations of [6]).

Fig. 8 shows the summed h-boson production cross-section for the first three subprocesses listed above, as a function of \(m_{\rm h}\) and \(m_{\rm A}\), for different values of \(\tan\beta\) and \(m_{\rm t}\). This cross-section is strongly enhanced, through the bbh contribution, for large values of \(\tan\beta\) and small values of \(m_{\rm A}\), but it decreases rapidly towards the SM Higgs-boson production cross-section, as \(m_{\rm h}\) increases towards its maximum allowed value. The apparent dependence on \(m_{\rm t}\), shown for the cross-section as a function of \(m_{\rm A}\), is only a reflection of the variation of the maximum allowed value of \(m_{\rm h}\) as \(m_{\rm t}\) varies.

Figs. 9 and 10 show separately the cross-sections for h-boson associated production with a W-boson or a tth - pair respectively. These cross-sections include the branching ratio for at least one \(\rm W\to\ell\nu\) decay, where the lepton (electron or muon) is used to trigger the experiment. For a given value of \(m_{\rm h}\), both cross-sections decrease rapidly as \(\tan\beta\) increases. Both cross-sections are suppressed with respect to the corresponding SM cross-sections, and are only comparable to them if \(m_{\rm h}\) is close to its maximum allowed value.

#### 3.1.3 Expected rates for signatures involving the h-boson

Tables 13\((gg\to h\), \(qq\to qqh\), bbh) and 14\((\rm Wh,t\bar{t}h\) with at least one \(\rm W\to\ell\nu\) decay) show the expected rates (cross-section times branching ratio: \(\sigma\times BR\)) for \(\rm h\to\gamma\gamma\) decays as a function of \(m_{\rm h}\), for \(m_{\rm t}=175\) GeV and four different values of \(\tan\beta\). The corresponding rates in the SM Higgs-boson case are also shown for comparison. As \(m_{\rm h}\) gets close to its maximum allowed value, for a given choice of \(\tan\beta\), the expected rates in crease rapidly towards values close to the corresponding SM rates, particularly in the case of Table 13, where the rates increase by more than a factor of 2, while \(m_{\rm h}\) changes by less than 1 GeV but \(m_{\rm A}\) varies from \(\sim 200\) GeV to \(\sim 500\) GeV. This steep dependence will have to be kept in mind when investigating the discovery potential in this particular channel. The expected rates for \(m_{\rm A}\sim 500\) GeV are somewhat larger (by 10 to 20%) than the corresponding SM rates, but this is well within the uncertainties due to the different treatment of the respective \(\rm h\to\gamma\gamma\) and SM H \(\to\gamma\gamma\) decay branching ratios in terms of QCD corrections.

Tables 15 and 16, for \(\rm Wh\) and \(t\bar{t}h\) associated production respectively, show the expected rates for \(\rm h\to b\bar{b}\) decays in a similar way. The same trends as in Tables 13 and 14 are observed, namely that the expected rates for a

The corresponding rates in the SM case are also shown for \(m_{\rm t}\) = 175 GeV._

### H-boson

The H-boson is the heavier of the CP-even MSSM neutral Higgs bosons: the mass range of interest is from 110 to 500 GeV (see Section 2). Over this mass range, the SM Higgs boson can be discovered mainly through \(\PH\to\ZZ^{(\star)}\to 4\ell\) decays, but also through \(\PH\to\gamma\gamma\) decays at the lower end of the mass spectrum. However, in the case of the MSSM H-boson, the spectrum of decay channels of interest is much richer and varies rapidly with \(m_{\PH}\) and with \(\tan\beta\). This is due to the strong suppression of the HZZ coupling (see Fig. 5), which enhances the branching ratios to other decay channels, such as \(\PH\to\tau\tau\) and \(\PH\to t\bar{t}\). Moreover, the \(\PH\to\hh\) channel, which does not exist in the SM, has a large branching ratio over a large range of \(m_{\PH}\). This channel is of particular interest, since it would provide a simultaneous discovery of the h- and H-bosons.

#### 3.2.1 Branching ratios

The \(\PH\to\gamma\gamma\) branching ratio is shown in Fig. 11 as a function of \(m_{\PH}\) (left side) and of \(m_{\PH}\) (right side), for different values of \(m_{\PH}\) and \(\tan\beta\). For a fixed value of \(\tan\beta\), this branching ratio decreases very rapidly as \(m_{\PH}\) increases. The reason for this behaviour arises from the strong suppression, as \(m_{\PH}\) increases, of the HWW coupling, which dominates the \(\PH\to\gamma\gamma\) branching ratio and is proportional to \(\cos^{2}(\beta-\alpha)\) (see Fig. 5). The dependence on \(m_{\PH}\) just reflects the increase of the minimum allowed value of \(m_{\PH}\) as \(m_{\PH}\) increases.

The MSSM \(\PH\to\ZZ^{(\star)}\to 4\ell\) branching ratio has a complicated structure, as shown in Fig. 12. Its main feature is that it is strongly suppressed with respect to the SM branching ratio, but it also varies rapidly with \(\tan\beta\). As shown below, for small values of \(\tan\beta\) and for \(2m_{\PH}<m_{\PH}<2m_{\PH}\), the \(\PH\to\hh\) decay branching ratio is dominant and, as a consequence, the \(\PH\to\ZZ^{(\star)}\to 4\ell\) branching ratio is even more suppressed in this case. It is in addition quite sensitive to the value of \(m_{\PH}\) and increases significantly as \(m_{\PH}\) increases. Since the \(\PH\to t\bar{t}\) decay channel suppresses very strongly the \(\PH\to\ZZ^{(\star)}\to 4\ell\) mode (for small values of \(\tan\beta\)), the threshold at which the \(\PH\to t\bar{t}\) channel opens up increases as \(m_{\PH}\) increases, and thus results in a wider region of the (\(m_{\PH}\), \(\tan\beta\)) plane where the \(\PH\to\ZZ^{(\star)}\to 4\ell\) mode could be observable. Finally, this channel is also of interest for values of \(\tan\beta\) smaller than 1, in a region theoretically disfavoured but not accessible to LEP. For \(\tan\beta<1.0\), the \(\PH\to\ZZ^{(\star)}\to 4\ell\) branching ratio grows rapidly as \(\tan\beta\) decreases, as shown in Fig. 13.

The \(\PH\to\tau\tau\) branching ratio is in most cases larger than the SM one, particularly for large values of \(m_{\PH}\), due to the suppressed couplings to gauge bosons in the MSSM case, and for large values of \(\tan\beta\), due to the enhanced \(\PH\tau\tau\) coupling (see Fig. 5). As shown in Fig. 14, for \(m_{\PH}>150\) GeV and for large values of \(\tan\beta\), the \(\PH\to\tau\tau\) branching ratio is almost independent of \(m_{\PH}\) and \(m_{\PH}\).

The \(\tau\tau\) and \(\mu\mu\) decay modes are subject to the same MSSM correction factors to the couplings, so their branching ratios are in the ratio \((m_{\tau}/m_{\mu})^{2}\), as in the SM case. The branching ratio in the \(\mu\mu\) channel is therefore nearly three orders of magnitude smaller than the \(\tau\tau\) branching ratio, but presents the same features, in particular at large values of \(\tan\beta\).

As shown in Fig. 15, the \(\mathrm{H}\to\mathrm{t}\overline{\mathrm{t}}\) channel is the dominant one for low values of \(\tan\beta\) and for \(m_{\mathrm{H}}>2m_{\mathrm{t}}\). This arises again from the strongly suppressed H-boson couplings to gauge bosons. As \(\tan\beta\) increases, the \(\mathrm{H}\to\mathrm{t}\overline{\mathrm{t}}\) channel competes with the \(\mathrm{H}\to\mathrm{b}\overline{\mathrm{b}}\) decay channel, and its branching ratio is reduced to less than 10% for \(\tan\beta=10\).

This short but necessary review of the H-boson branching ratios would not be complete without a discussion of the \(\mathrm{H}\to\mathrm{h}\mathrm{h}\) decay mode. As shown in Fig. 16, this decay mode, unique to the MSSM H-boson, is dominant for \(2m_{\mathrm{h}}<m_{\mathrm{H}}<2m_{\mathrm{t}}\) and for small values of \(\tan\beta\), since the Hhh coupling is proportional to \(\cos 2\alpha\)\(\sin(\beta+\alpha)\). The dependence on \(m_{\mathrm{t}}\) just reflects the variation of \(m_{\mathrm{h}}\) with \(m_{\mathrm{t}}\) at a given point in the \((m_{\mathrm{A}},\tan\beta)\) plane. One of the most promising signatures for the \(\mathrm{H}\to\mathrm{h}\mathrm{h}\) channel is \(\mathrm{H}\to\mathrm{h}\mathrm{h}\to\mathrm{b}\overline{\mathrm{b}}\)\(\gamma\gamma\). The \(\mathrm{H}\to\mathrm{h}\mathrm{h}\to\mathrm{b}\overline{\mathrm{b}}\)\(\gamma\gamma\) branching ratio also reflects the shapes of the \(\mathrm{h}\to\mathrm{b}\overline{\mathrm{b}}\) and \(\mathrm{h}\to\gamma\gamma\) branching ratios, as can be seen by comparing Fig. 16 and Fig. 17.

#### 3.2.2 Production cross-sections

As discussed already for the h-boson, several processes contribute to Higgs boson production at the LHC. The H-boson production cross-section is usually calculated as the sum of contributions from the following subprocesses: \(gg\to H\), \(qq\to qqH\)\((WW_{fau},\ ZZ_{fau})\) and \(\mathrm{b}\overline{\mathrm{b}}\). Fig. 18 shows this sum for four values of \(\tan\beta\) and for three values of \(m_{\mathrm{t}}\). It can be clearly seen that the contribution from the \(\mathrm{b}\overline{\mathrm{b}}\) channel is strongly enhanced for large values of \(\tan\beta\) (note the differences in vertical scale). Over the region of low values of \(m_{\mathrm{H}}\) shown in Fig. 19, the variation of the H-boson production cross-section as a function of \(m_{\mathrm{t}}\) merely reflects the variation of \(m_{\mathrm{H}}\) versus \(m_{\mathrm{t}}\). Finally, Fig. 20 shows the H-boson production cross-section for values of \(\tan\beta\) lower than 1, for which the MSSM predictions are also enhanced with respect to the SM ones.

#### 3.2.3 Expected rates for signatures involving the H-boson

Table 17 (\(gg\to H\), \(qq\to qqH\), \(\mathrm{b\bar{b}H}\)) shows the expected rates (\(\sigma\times BR\)) for \(\mathrm{H\to\gamma\gamma}\) decays as a function of \(m_{\mathrm{H}}\), for \(m_{\mathrm{t}}=175\) GeV and four different values of \(\tan\beta\). The corresponding rate for a SM Higgs-boson with \(m_{\mathrm{H}}=113\) GeV is also shown for comparison. The \(\mathrm{H\to\gamma\gamma}\) channel is only accessible for relatively large values of \(\tan\beta\) and over a very narrow range of \(m_{\mathrm{H}}\) close to the minimum allowed value (e.g. near \(m_{\mathrm{H}}=113\) GeV for \(m_{\mathrm{t}}=175\) GeV), i.e. close to \(m_{\mathrm{A}}=60\) GeV. The largest rates expected for the MSSM H-boson are comparable to the SM \(\mathrm{H\to\gamma\gamma}\) rates, as illustrated in Fig. 21.

Tables 18 and 19 show the expected rates for \(\mathrm{H\to ZZ^{(\star)}\to 4\ell}\) decays for a range of values of \(\tan\beta\). Except for values of \(\tan\beta\) lower than 1, the expected MSSM rates are strongly suppressed with respect to the SM ones. The very rapid decrease of the \(\mathrm{H\to ZZ^{(\star)}\to 4\ell}\) branching ratio as \(\tan\beta\) increases cannot be compensated by the rise in the production cross-section due to the \(\mathrm{b\bar{b}H}\) contribution.

Figure 20: _Production cross-section for an H-boson (\(gg\to H\), \(\mathrm{qq\to qqH}\), \(\mathrm{b\bar{b}H}\)) as a function of \(m_{\mathrm{H}}\) for low values of \(\tan\beta\). The solid line is for \(m_{\mathrm{t}}=175\) GeV, the dashed one for \(m_{\mathrm{t}}=200\) GeV and the dot-dashed one for \(m_{\mathrm{t}}=150\) GeV. The figures also show the SM predictions for \(m_{\mathrm{t}}=175\) GeV (dotted lines)._

Table 20: _Expected rates (\(\sigma\times BR\)) for \(\rm H\to t\overline{t}\) decays (gg \(\to H\), qq \(\to\) qqH, b\(\overline{\rm b}\)H) as a function of \(m_{\rm H}\), for \(m_{\rm t}\) =175 GeV and four different values of tan \(\beta\). The corresponding rates in the SM case are also shown._In contrast, Table 20 shows that the H \(\to\tau\tau\) channel is much more promising in the MSSM case than in the SM case. Most of the enhancement for the MSSM \(\mathrm{H}\to\tau\tau\) rates arises from the very large expected production cross-section for large values of \(\tan\beta\) (see Fig. 18). Similar observations apply to the H \(\to\mu\mu\) channel, for which the expected rates are about a factor 30 lower than for \(\mathrm{H}\to\tau\tau\), as shown in Table 21.

Table 22 shows the expected rates for the \(\mathrm{H}\to\mathrm{t}\overline{\mathrm{t}}\) channel, which is enhanced with respect to the SM case for low values of \(\tan\beta\). However, the rapid increase of the \(\mathrm{H}\to\mathrm{b}\overline{\mathrm{b}}\) branching ratio as \(\tan\beta\) increases, strongly suppresses the discovery potential for this channel for values of \(\tan\beta\) larger than \(\sim 3\).

Finally, Table 23 shows the expected rates for the \(\mathrm{H}\to\mathrm{h}h\to\mathrm{b}\overline{\mathrm{b}}\)\(\gamma\gamma\) channel, which are small but observable for \(2m_{\mathrm{h}}<m_{\mathrm{H}}<2m_{\mathrm{t}}\) and for values of \(\tan\beta\) smaller than \(\sim 10\).

### A-boson

The CP-odd neutral Higgs boson, or A-boson, is degenerate in mass with the H-boson over a large fraction of the (\(m_{\rm A}\), \(\tan\beta\)) plane. Many of the interesting final states (\(t\overline{t}\), \(\tau^{+}\tau^{-}\), \(\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\) ) would therefore be observable for the H- and A-boson together. The absence of tree-level couplings of the A-boson to gauge-boson pairs has an important impact on the predictions discussed below.

#### 3.3.1 Branching ratios

Due to the absence of \(ZZ\), \(WW\) and \(hh\) decay channels, the A \(\to\tau\tau\) channel is important even for low values of \(\tan\beta\), in contrast to the SM Higgs and to the MSSM \(H\)-boson. For \(100<m_{\rm A}<400\) GeV and for low values of \(\tan\beta\), Fig. 22 shows that the A \(\to\tau\tau\) branching ratio is about a factor 5 higher than the H \(\to\tau\tau\) branching ratio. Fig. 22 also shows that, as \(m_{\rm A}\) increases, the A \(\to\tau\tau\) branching ratio sharply decreases for \(m_{\rm A}\sim 200\) and 350 GeV and for low values of \(\tan\beta\). These two thresholds correspond to the opening of the A \(\to\) Zh and A \(\to t\overline{t}\) channels respectively. For larger values of \(\tan\beta\), the dominant decay mode is A \(\to\) b\(\overline{b}\), which results in a flat behaviour of the A \(\to\tau\tau\) branching ratio versus \(m_{\rm A}\). The A \(\to\mu\mu\) branching ratio shows a very similar behaviour, but the branching ratio is lower by \((m_{\mu}/m_{\tau})^{2}\).

As shown in Fig. 23, the A \(\to\) t\(\overline{t}\) channel is the dominant one for low values of \(\tan\beta\) and for \(m_{\rm A}>2m_{\rm t}\). As \(\tan\beta\) increases, the A \(\to\) t\(\overline{t}\) channel competes with the A \(\to\) b\(\overline{b}\) decay channel, and its branching ratio is reduced to less than 20% for \(\tan\beta=10\), where it is close to the SM one.

Over the kinematically allowed region, where \(m_{\rm Z}+m_{\rm h}<m_{\rm A}<2m_{\rm t}\), Fig. 24 shows that the A \(\to\) Zh channel becomes dominant for low values of \(\tan\beta\). The shape of the A \(\to\) Zh branching ratio is not significantly affected when requiring \(\rm h\to b\overline{b}\) and \(\rm Z\to\ell\ell\) decays in the final state (see Fig. 25). As for the A \(\to\) t\(\overline{t}\) channel, the A \(\to\) Zh branching ratio decreases rapidly as \(\tan\beta\) increases, because the A \(\to\) b\(\overline{b}\) decays become dominant.

#### 3.3.2 Production cross-sections

Due to the absence of WWA and ZZA couplings, the A-boson is produced only through the \(gg\) fusion and b\(\bar{\mathrm{b}}\)A subprocesses. As shown in Fig. 26, the summed production cross-section is larger than the corresponding SM one in most cases. This effect is most visible for values of \(\tan\beta\) larger than \(\sim\)10, where the b\(\bar{\mathrm{b}}\)A subprocess is dominant. For lower values of \(\tan\beta\), the b\(\bar{\mathrm{b}}\)A contribution disappears rapidly and the production cross-section decreases rapidly to values well below the SM Higgs cross-sections. The dependence on \(m_{\mathrm{t}}\) is weak, but for the lowest values of \(\tan\beta\), the \(gg\) cross-section is enhanced and clear peaks in the production cross-section appear around \(2m_{\mathrm{t}}\).

### H\({}^{\pm}\)-boson

The charged Higgs boson can be searched for most easily in top-quark decays, i.e. through \(gg\to t\overline{t}\) followed by a \(t\to\) H\({}^{+}\)b decay, for \(m_{W}<m_{H^{\pm}}<m_{t}\). Pair-production of charged Higgs bosons yields too low a cross-section, and charged Higgs-boson production in supersymmetric particle decays is outside the scope of this report.

#### 3.4.1 Branching ratios

If the H\({}^{+}\to t\overline{b}\) decay is not kinematically allowed, the dominant decay mode for tan \(\beta>1.5\) is H\({}^{+}\to\tau\nu\). Fig. 27 shows the H\({}^{+}\to\tau\nu\) branching ratio as a function of \(m_{H^{+}}\), for various values of \(m_{t}\) and tan \(\beta\). This does not take into account recent calculations [9], which include possible decays of the charged Higgs boson to SUSY particles and show that the H\({}^{+}\to\tau\nu\) branching ratio may in some cases decrease significantly for low values of tan \(\beta\). The H\({}^{+}\to\tau\nu\) branching ratio is close to 100% and flat as a function of \(m_{H^{+}}\). If \(m_{H^{+}}\) becomes larger than \(m_{t}\), then the H\({}^{+}\to t\overline{b}\) branching ratio opens up and the H\({}^{+}\to\tau\nu\) branching ratio decreases more or less rapidly depending on tan \(\beta\).

Figure 27: H\({}^{+}\to\tau\nu\) branching ratio as a function of \(m_{H^{+}}\) for four values of tan \(\beta\). The solid line is for \(m_{t}\) = 175 GeV, the dashed one for \(m_{t}\) = 200 GeV and the dot-dashed one for \(m_{t}\) = 150 GeV.

#### 3.4.2 Production cross-sections

Charged Higgs production is considered through the \(gg\to{\rm t}\overline{\rm t}\) process, followed by \({\rm t}\to{\rm H}^{+}{\rm b}\) decays, for \(m_{{\rm H}^{+}}<m_{{\rm t}}\). The decay \({\rm t}\to{\rm H}^{+}{\rm b}\), if kinematically allowed, can then compete with the \({\rm t}\to{\rm W}{\rm b}\) decay. Fig. 28 shows the effective production cross-section for a charged Higgs with positive charge \(\sigma_{\rm H^{+}}=\sigma_{\rm t}\overline{\rm t}\)\(\times\)\(BR({\rm t}\to{\rm H}^{+}{\rm b})\), as a function of \(m_{{\rm H}^{+}}\). This cross-section has a minimum around \(5<\tan\beta<10\), due to a term proportional to \((m_{b}^{\ 2}\tan^{2}\beta+m_{t}^{\ 2}/\tan^{2}\beta)\) in the \({\rm t}\to{\rm H}^{+}{\rm b}\) branching ratio. As \(m_{{\rm H}^{+}}\) increases towards \(m_{{\rm t}}\), the importance of this term decreases as \((m_{{\rm t}}{}^{2}-m_{{\rm H}^{+}}{}^{2})\), and the \({\rm t}\to{\rm H}^{+}{\rm b}\) branching ratio becomes asymptotically independent of \(\tan\beta\) for \(m_{{\rm H}^{+}}\sim m_{{\rm t}}\). The effective charged Higgs production cross-section depends strongly on \(m_{{\rm t}}\). As \(m_{{\rm t}}\) increases, the \({\rm t}\overline{\rm t}\) cross-section decreases, but the mass range accessible to \({\rm t}\to{\rm H}^{+}{\rm b}\) decays in creases.

For large values of \(\tan\beta\), the \({\rm t}\to{\rm H}^{+}{\rm b}\) branching ratio depends strongly on the value for \(m_{b}\) used in the calculation, since one of the main terms used to compute the \({\rm t}\to{\rm H}^{+}{\rm b}\) branching ratio is proportional to \(m_{b}^{\ 2}\tan\beta^{2}\):

\[BR(t\to H^{+}b) = \frac{1}{2}\ \frac{G_{F}^{\ 2}}{32\pi m_{W}^{\ 2}m_{t}^{\ 3}}[(m_{H}^{\ 2}+m_{t}^{\ 2}-m_{b}^{\ 2})^{\ 2}+4m_{H}^{\ 2}+m_{t}^{\ 2}]\] \[[(m_{t}^{\ 2}-m_{H^{+}}^{\ 2}+m_{b}^{\ 2})(m_{b}^{\ 2}\tan^{2}\beta+m_{t}^{\ 2}/\tan^{2}\beta)+4m_{b}^{\ 2}m_{t}^{\ 2}]\]

Throughout this report, a _running_\({\rm b}\)-quark mass is used5 with the evolution defined as [6]:

Footnote 5: For the analysis presented in the TP, this effect was ignored, which led to an overestimate of the cross-section for large \(\tan\beta\).

\[m_{b}=\bar{m}_{b}[\ln\frac{\bar{m}_{b}}{\Lambda_{QCD}}/\ln\frac{m_{W}}{\Lambda _{QCD}}]^{12/23}, \tag{5}\]

for five flavours, \(\bar{m}_{b}=4.25\) GeV, and \(\Lambda_{QCD}=190\) MeV. The use of the proper _running_\({\rm b}\)-quark mass modifies the \({\rm t}\to{\rm H}^{+}{\rm b}\) branching ratio by as much as 50% for large values of \(\tan\beta\).

#### 3.4.3 Expected rates for signatures involving the \({\rm H}^{\pm}\) boson

Table 28 presents the expected rates for the \({\rm H}^{\pm}\to\tau\nu\) final state, defined as \(\sigma\times BR=2\sigma_{\rm t}\overline{\rm t}\)\(\times\)\(BR({\rm t}\to{\rm H}^{+}{\rm b})\)\(\times\)\(BR({\rm H}^{+}\to\tau\nu)\). This formula neglects the small fraction of events where both top quarks decay to a charged Higgs boson.

A dedicated package, developed for a systematic study of the MSSM Higgs sector, has been used throughout the study reported here. A detailed description of this code will be provided as soon as it is released for public use. This section only gives a short description of the physics inputs and algorithms.

The package consists of three main parts:

\(\bullet\) the PYTHIA 5.707 [10] event generator, interfaced to a routine [4], which calculates the MSSM Higgs boson masses and couplings in the two-loop equivalent approximation;

\(\bullet\) a set of semi-analytical routines, which calculate the MSSM correction factors to the production cross-sections and the MSSM branching ratios. This part uses the code from [6];

\(\bullet\) a set of semi-analytical routines, used to interpolate the expected experimental significances in the (\(m_{\rm A}\), \(\tan\beta\)) and (\(m_{\rm h}\), \(\tan\beta\)) planes, and a semi-automatic derivation of the expected 5\(\sigma\)-discovery contour curves.

Whereas this package provides the means to change \(m_{\rm t}\) in a flexible way, at the moment there is almost no flexibility as far as the MSSM parameters (other than \(m_{\rm A}\) and \(\tan\beta\)) are concerned. In practice, the simulation assumes that mixing is minimal in the SUSY sector (\(A_{t}=A_{b}=\mu=0\)) and that all SUSY particles (stops, sbottoms, charginos, neutralinos, etc.) have a mass of \(\sim\) 1 TeV.

This package does not presently treat in a consistent way QCD corrections when evolving quark masses, the strong coupling constant \(\alpha\), and decay widths, since the treatment of these issues is different in PYTHIA, [4] and [6]. The uncertainties arising from these inconsistencies are however believed to be smaller than the dominant experimental and theoretical uncertainties (higher-order corrections, \(m_{\rm t}\), structure functions).

### Interface to PYTHIA

The event generator package PYTHIA (version 5.707) has been interfaced to the code from [4]6 through a subroutine (SUBH), which calculates the masses and the couplings in the MSSM Higgs sector in the two-loop approximation. This code is called from the PYTHIA subroutine PYINRE with the option MSTP(4) = 3. This option requires that the chosen values of \(\tan\beta\) (PARU(141)) and of \(m_{\rm A}\) (PMAS(36,1)) be given as input parameters7.

Footnote 6: This implementation is not supported by the author of PYTHIA and not included in the official PYTHIA 5.707 version.

Footnote 7: The standard version of PYTHIA uses as input parameters: MSTP(4) = 2 (tree level), PARU(141) = \(\tan\beta\) and PMAS(25,1) = \(m_{\rm h}\). For a discussion of the effect of going from tree-level to two-loop calculations, see Section 2.2.

The PYTHIA code which calculates the branching ratios and the cross-sections has not been modified, but the couplings that enter these calculationsare now computed at the two-loop level.

### MSSM branching ratios and cross-sections

This part of the package, shown schematically in Fig. 29, is based on the code of [6]. It provides MSSM correction factors to the SM Higgs production cross-sections, which are usually taken from PYTHIA, and calculates the MSSM Higgs boson decay widths and branching ratios. In the future, this code will be modified to include Higgs-boson decays to SUSY particles and non-minimal mixing in the SUSY sector.

The MSSM correction factors to couplings and tree-level processes are calculated as described in Section 2.1 (see Table 2). The MSSM correction factors to processes involving loops at the lowest order, such as \(gg\to\,H\) or \(\PH\to\gamma\gamma\), are calculated including the contributions from ordinary fermions, charged gauge bosons, charged Higgs bosons, sfermions and charginos, but the SUSY particle masses are all fixed at 1 TeV.

The following sets of Higgs boson decay modes are treated by the package:

* \(h\to c\overline{c}\),bb,t\(\overline{t}\),gg,\(\tau^{+}\tau^{-}\),\(\gamma\gamma\),WW,ZZ,AA,Z\(\gamma\) ;
* \(H\to c\overline{c}\),bb,t\(\overline{t}\),gg,\(\tau^{+}\tau^{-}\),\(\gamma\gamma\),WW,ZZ,hh,AA,Z\(\gamma\) ;
* \(A\to c\overline{c}\),bb,t\(\overline{t}\),gg,\(\tau^{+}\tau^{-}\),\(\gamma\gamma\),Zh,Z\(\gamma\).

This part of the package also provides the possibility to print the results of the calculations in the form of tables (LATEX format) or histograms (HBOOK format); the default version of the package provides these tables and histograms for a few values of tan \(\beta\) over the required Higgs boson mass ranges, for the h, H and A decay widths, branching ratios, production cross-sections and expected rates. Also provided are the SM predictions, as obtained by the PYTHIA event generator.

### Contour curves in the MSSM parameter space

To obtain the expected sensitivity to a given signal, usually expressed as discovery contour curves, the package proceeds in the following way for each specific Higgs boson decay channel and for a given value of the experimental integrated luminosity:

1. a point is chosen in the \((m_{A},\tan\beta)\) plane;
2. the corresponding values of \(m_{h}\) and \(m_{H}\) are calculated;
3. a data file, containing the expected signal and background rates for the appropriate Higgs boson decay channel, for both low- and high-luminosity operation of the ATLAS detector, is used as input to calculate by simple linear interpolation the expected sensitivity for the chosen point in parameter space;Figure 29: _Schematic view of the procedure used for calculating branching ratios and cross-sections in the MSSM Higgs sector._

4. if the expected significance is above threshold (the default value is \(5\sigma\)), the chosen point in parameter space is validated as being observable in this channel.

This procedure, shown schematically in Fig. 30, has to be repeated for different values of \(m_{\mathrm{t}}\), of the experimental integrated luminosity and of the chosen significance threshold.

### Default semi-automatic procedure

The main steps of the complete default procedure are described below; the first three steps can be considered as initialisation steps, which do not have to be repeated when varying the experimental input:

1. a grid is defined in the (\(m_{\mathrm{A}}\), \(\tan\beta\)) plane; this grid linearly spans \(m_{\mathrm{A}}\) from 50 to 500 GeV in 225 bins of 2 GeV, and logarithmically spans \(\tan\beta\) from 1 to 50 in 100 bins. Three values of \(m_{\mathrm{t}}\) are chosen for the calculations, \(m_{\mathrm{t}}=150\), 175 and 200 GeV. Three values of the experimental integrated luminosity are used to evaluate the discovery contour curves, \(3\cdot 10^{4}\) pb\({}^{-1}\), \(10^{5}\) pb\({}^{-1}\) and \(3\cdot 10^{5}\) pb\({}^{-1}\);
2. the SM Higgs production cross-sections are computed using PYTHIA, separately for all relevant subprocesses (\(gg\to H\), \(WW_{fus}\), \(ZZ_{fus}\), \(\mathrm{b\bar{b}}\)\(H\), \(t\bar{t}\)\(H\), \(WH\), \(ZH\) and \(t\bar{t}\) ). For the \(gg\to H\), \(t\bar{t}\)\(H\) and \(t\bar{t}\) subprocesses, the cross-sections are computed for the three chosen values of \(m_{\mathrm{t}}\). The results are stored in histograms as a function of the Higgs-boson masses;
3. the corresponding MSSM branching ratios and production cross-sections are then computed as described above, for each subprocess and for all relevant Higgs boson states. The total expected rates (\(\sigma\ \times\ BR\)) are then stored in 2-dimensional arrays corresponding to the chosen grid in the (\(m_{\mathrm{A}}\), \(\tan\beta\)) plane. The values of \(m_{\mathrm{h}}\) and \(m_{\mathrm{H}}\) corresponding to each point in the grid are also stored;
4. the input information from detailed physics simulations of the various channels is read in. This contains the expected numbers of signal (S) and background (B) events for a few values of the Higgs boson masses. Due to the variation of detector performance (resolution, efficiency and kinematic thresholds for triggering and reconstruction) as a function of luminosity, the expected values of S and B are given separately for low- (\(3\cdot 10^{4}\) pb\({}^{-1}\)) and high- (\(10^{5}\) pb\({}^{-1}\)) luminosity operation. The input files also provide the range of Higgs boson masses over which the simulation results can be extrapolated; for example, values of \(m_{\mathrm{h}}\) lower than 60 to 70 GeV are not assumed to be observable at the present stage. Finally, they provide the expected mass resolution and relevant Higgs boson width for each mass value;Figure 30: _Schematic view of the procedure used for deriving the \(5\sigma\)-discovery contour curves in the MSSM Higgs sector._

5. the expected significance of each signal channel is calculated for each point of the grid. The usual naive estimator \(S/\sqrt{B}\) is used in all cases, except if both S and B are smaller than 25, in which case Poisson statistics are used to compute the equivalent Gaussian significance. If the result exceeds 5\(\sigma\), the corresponding bin in a 2-dimensional histogram representing the grid in the \((m_{A},\tan\beta)\) parameter space is set to 1. For the more complicated \(H\to hh\) and \(A\to Zh\) channels, the interpolation procedure is 2-dimensional, since two MSSM Higgs bosons are involved. For the \(A\to\tau\tau\) and \(H\to\tau\tau\) channels, the signals overlap completely for \(m_{A}>140\) GeV but much less so for smaller values of \(m_{A}\). The impact of this incomplete or complete overlap of the two signal channels is properly taken into account in the calculation of the expected overall significance. When the Higgs boson width is not negligible with respect to the experimental width, the experimental input is rescaled accordingly;
6. the results in the \((m_{A},\tan\beta)\) plane are mapped onto the \((m_{h},\tan\beta)\) plane;
7. the final 2-dimensional histograms are saved for each channel separately and used to draw the 5\(\sigma\)-discovery contour curves with PAW, as a function of integrated luminosity and of \(m_{t}\);
8. ATLAS and CMS are combined independently, assuming the same sensitivity for all channels except \(H\to\gamma\gamma\), for which CMS is assumed to have 30% (resp. 10%) better sensitivity at low (resp. high) luminosity [11].

## 5 Observability of MSSM Higgs bosons

There are many processes that could provide evidence for one or more MSSM Higgs bosons at the LHC. Several of them have been studied for the TP:

* \(h\to\gamma\gamma\), \(H\to\gamma\gamma\) and \(Wh\), \(t\overline{t}h\) with \(W\to l\nu\) and \(h\to\gamma\gamma\),
* \(H\to ZZ^{(\star)}\to 4\ell\),
* \(H\to\tau\tau\) and \(A\to\tau\tau\),
* \(t\overline{t}\) with \(t\to\,H^{+}b\) and \(H^{+}\to\tau\nu\).

Since the TP, a number of other possible channels have been studied:

* \(Wh\) and \(t\overline{t}h\) with \(h\to b\overline{b}\),
* \(H\to\mu\mu\) and \(A\to\mu\mu\),
* \(H\to t\overline{t}\) and \(A\to t\overline{t}\),
* \(H\to hh\) with \(h\to b\overline{b}\) and \(h\to\gamma\gamma\),
* \(A\to Zh\) with \(h\to b\overline{b}\) and \(Z\to\ell\ell\).

A complete study of any given channel requires accurate estimates of the expected signal rates, including the detector acceptance as well as its reconstruction efficiency and mass resolution (in most cases), and thorough calculations of the various backgrounds, whether irreducible, i.e. corresponding to the same final state as the signal, or not.

This Section briefly describes the results of the simulations leading to the expected signal and background rates, referring to separate work or to the relevant Appendix to this report for more detailed discussions. For all signal channels, only SM background sources were considered. For several signal channels, the expected observability can be simply rescaled from studies of the corresponding SM channel (\(H\to\gamma\gamma\), \(H\to b\overline{b}\) and \(H\to ZZ^{(\star)}\to 4\ell\)).

The procedure described in Section 4 was used consistently throughout the study, and the experimental inputs to this procedure, i.e. the expected signal and background rates at low and high luminosity, are presented separately below for each channel, for a few relevant values of the corresponding Higgs boson mass. The results are presented as \(5\sigma\)-discovery contour curves in the \((m_{A},\tan\beta)\) and \((m_{h},\tan\beta)\) planes, both as a function of integrated luminosity (\(3\cdot 10^{4}\) pb\({}^{-1}\), \(10^{5}\) pb\({}^{-1}\) and \(3\cdot 10^{5}\) pb\({}^{-1}\)) 8 and of the top-quark mass \(m_{t}\) (\(m_{t}=150\), \(175\) and \(200\) GeV). In the case of the \((m_{h},\tan\beta)\) plane, some values are excluded theoretically and the corresponding area is cross-hatched in the plots.

Footnote 8: For consistency, it is assumed that \(10^{5}\) pb\({}^{-1}\) consists of \(3\cdot 10^{4}\) pb\({}^{-1}\) (low luminosity operation) + \(0.7\cdot 10^{5}\) pb\({}^{-1}\) (high luminosity operation), and similarly that \(3\cdot 10^{5}\) pb\({}^{-1}\) consists of \(3\cdot 10^{4}\) pb\({}^{-1}\) + \(2.7\cdot 10^{5}\) pb\({}^{-1}\).

### The \(\mathbf{h\to\gamma\gamma}\) and \(\mathbf{H\to\gamma\gamma}\) channels

The most recent results on the observability of the inclusive \(\mathbf{H\to\gamma\gamma}\) channel with the ATLAS detector have been described in detail in [3] for the case of a SM Higgs boson. The reader will find in [3] the definition of the selection criteria and a justification of the expected performance of the ATLAS detector in this channel. In particular, one should note that the photon identification efficiency, the reducible background rejection and the diphoton mass resolution were obtained from a full simulation of the ATLAS detector.

For Higgs boson masses between 80 and 150 GeV, Table 29 shows the expected signal and background rates and the expected significances, for integrated luminosities of \(3\cdot 10^{4}\) pb\({}^{-1}\) (low luminosity operation) and \(10^{5}\) pb\({}^{-1}\) (high luminosity operation). The low luminosity performance of the ATLAS detector is improved with respect to the high luminosity performance in terms of photon identification efficiency (85% compared to 80%) and of diphoton mass resolution (1.05 GeV compared to 1.25 GeV for \(m_{\mathrm{H}}=100\) GeV).

The search for the SM Higgs boson in \(\mathbf{H\to\gamma\gamma}\) decays can also be performed using WH and \(\mathrm{t\overline{t}}\) production, for events with a high-\(\mathrm{p_{T}}\) isolated lepton from W-decay in addition to the two photons from Higgs decay. The signal-to-background ratio is much higher in this channel than in the inclusive \(\mathbf{H\to\gamma\gamma}\) channel, as shown in Table 30, obtained by extrapolating the results of [12]. The signal rates, however, are too low in this channel for it to be observed with integrated luminosities much smaller than \(3\cdot 10^{5}\) pb\({}^{-1}\). Nevertheless, the expected sensitivity to this channel can be combined with that for the inclusive channel to improve the overall sensitivity to a possible signal.

The expected MSSM rates, for both \(\mathbf{h\to\gamma\gamma}\) and \(\mathbf{H\to\gamma\gamma}\) decays, are generally suppressed with respect to the SM case, and are only comparable to the SM rates over a very limited mass range for the Higgs boson under consideration (see Sections 3.1 and 3.2). As explained in Section 4, the rates and significances quoted in Tables 29 and 30 are used as input values to the procedure that determines the observability of this channel in the MSSM case. To obtain \(5\sigma\)-discovery contour curves in the \((m_{\mathrm{A}},\,\tan\beta)\) and \((m_{\mathrm{h}},\,\tan\beta)\) planes, only \(\mathbf{h}\)-boson masses larger than 70 GeV were considered, since a proper experimental study of signal acceptance and background rates has not been performed for masses much below 80 GeV.

The expected \(5\sigma\)-discovery contour curves for ATLAS are shown in the following pages, as a function of integrated luminosity and of \(m_{\mathrm{t}}\):

* Figs. 31 to 34 for the \(\mathbf{h\to\gamma\gamma}\) inclusive channel. Fig. 31 shows that the observability in the \((m_{\mathrm{A}},\,\tan\beta)\) plane depends critically on the integrated luminosity, which just reflects the very slow variation of \(m_{\mathrm{h}}\) and of \(\sigma\times BR\) as \(m_{\mathrm{A}}\) increases. Fig. 33 illustrates this fact in the \((m_{\mathrm{h}},\,\tan\beta)\) plane and shows that, as expected from Table 29, a \(5\sigma\)-discovery cannot be achieved for \(m_{\mathrm{h}}<90\) GeV, even with the largest integrated luminosity considered here. As shown in Figs. 32 and 34, the observability improves significantly as \(m_{\mathrm{t}}\) increases, due to the largervalues of \(m_{\rm h}\) expected for given values of \(m_{\rm A}\) and \(\tan\beta\).
* Figs. 35 to 37 for the \(\rm h\to\gamma\gamma\) associated channel, which, as discussed above, is only accessible for an integrated luminosity of \(3\cdot 10^{5}\) pb\({}^{-1}\). In contrast to the \(\rm h\to\gamma\gamma\) inclusive channel, the sensitivity extends down to \(\tan\beta=1\), for \(m_{\rm t}=175\) GeV and for values of \(m_{\rm A}\) larger than 150 to 200 GeV, as shown in Fig. 35. Fig. 36 shows that the observability of this channel is not very sensitive to the value of \(m_{\rm t}\), except for \(m_{\rm t}=150\) GeV and \(\tan\beta<2\). This is due to the fact that \(m_{\rm h}\) is smaller than 70 GeV in this case, as can be seen clearly in Fig. 37.
* Figs. 38 to 41 for the combined \(\rm h\to\gamma\gamma\) inclusive and associated channels. Fig. 38 shows that a combined \(5\sigma\)-discovery is possible for all values of \(\tan\beta\) provided \(m_{\rm A}\) is larger than 180 GeV (resp. 300 GeV), for an integrated luminosity of \(3\cdot 10^{5}\) pb\({}^{-1}\) (resp. \(10^{5}\) pb\({}^{-1}\)). Fig. 39 shows that the combined sensitivity does not vary much with \(m_{\rm t}\), except for \(\tan\beta<2\) and \(m_{\rm t}=150\) GeV, as for the associated channel.
* Figs. 42 to 45 for the inclusive \(\rm H\to\gamma\gamma\) channel. These figures are included mainly for completeness, since the \(m_{\rm H}\) range accessible in this channel is quite small, although it gets wider as \(m_{\rm t}\) increases.

Figs. 38 to 41 deserve several further remarks:

* in the \((m_{\rm A},\tan\beta)\) plane, the position of the \(5\sigma\)-discovery contour curves is uncertain to \(\sim\pm 30\) GeV along the \(m_{\rm A}\) -axis, due to the theoretical uncertainties still inherent in the calculation of \(m_{\rm h}\) as a function of \(m_{\rm A}\);
* the \(\rm h\to\gamma\gamma\) branching ratio was computed assuming that all SUSY particles have a mass of 1000 GeV. More realistic mass spectra of SUSY particles usually contain lighter stop-quarks and charginos, and this may significantly decrease the \(\rm h\to\gamma\gamma\) branching ratio [13]. Possible decays of the \(\rm h\)-boson to the lightest neutralino may also affect the \(\rm h\to\gamma\gamma\) branching ratio [9];
* SUSY particle masses lighter than 1000 GeV could strongly affect the gg \(\to\)\(\rm h\) production cross-section. In fact, for some specific choices of the SUSY model parameters, this cross-section could decrease by more than an order of magnitude. The \(\rm h\to\gamma\gamma\) channel could then only be observed at the LHC through \(\rm Wh\) and \(\rm t\bar{t}\) production with a somewhat reduced sensitivity but not overly so. This emphasises the need for a more systematic study of this channel in the near future;
* since the SM and MSSM \(\rm h/H\to\gamma\gamma\) rates are very similar over the accessible region in the \((m_{\rm A},\tan\beta)\) plane, the observation of \(\rm h/H\to\gamma\gamma\) decays alone at the LHC will not be sufficient to demonstrate the existence of a non-SM Higgs sector.

### The \(\mathbf{h\to bb}\) channel

The SM \(\PH\to\bbbar\) channel has recently been studied in [14], where both WH and \(\ttbar\PH\) production were considered, with final states containing one high-\(\ttbar\) lepton from W-boson decay for triggering and two (resp. three or four) reconstructed \(\bb\)-jets in the \(\PH\) (resp. \(\ttbar\PH\)) case.

The conclusions of [14] were that a signal from \(\PH\to\bbbar\) decays may be observed above the background at the LHC for \(m_{\PH}<90\)-\(100\) GeV and an integrated luminosity of \(3\cdot 10^{4}\) pb\({}^{-1}\), provided excellent \(\bb\)-tagging performance can be achieved with the detector. Recent work on the \(\bb\)-tagging capabilities of the ATLAS detector and interactions with the physics referees can be summarised as follows:

* recent simulations [15], summarised in Appendix A, indicate that an overall \(\bb\)-tagging efficiency \(\epsilon_{b}=60\%\) can be achieved with the combined use of vertexing and of soft-lepton tags and with the B-layer present in the Inner Detector. The corresponding rejection expected against light-quark and gluon- (resp. charm-quark) jets is \(\sim 100\) (resp. \(\sim 10\));
* a signal from WH production can only be seen above the dominant \(\ttbar\) background if tight veto cuts against additional jets and leptons are applied [14], which is certainly possible at low luminosity. It is however clear that further studies are needed to define efficient veto cuts at high luminosity and understand whether the signal sensitivity can be improved;
* a signal from \(\ttbar\) production could probably not be extracted without a complete reconstruction of the top-quark decays to solve the large combinatorial problems arising from the presence of four \(\bb\)-quarks in the final state.

Therefore, until more work is done for the \(\ttbar\) channel, the results of [14] are extrapolated to the MSSM Higgs sector by using only the WH channel at low luminosity and by rescaling the results of [14] to an integrated luminosity of \(3\cdot 10^{4}\) pb\({}^{-1}\) and to the expected improved \(\bb\)-tagging performance. Table 31 shows the resulting expected values for the signal and background rates, computed in a \(\pm 20\) GeV mass bin around the reconstructed invariant mass of the \(\bbbar\) pair, and the expected significances. The background from \(\ttbar\) production corresponds to \(\sim 30\%\) of the total background for \(m_{\PH}=175\) GeV. For different values of \(m_{\PH}\), the change in production cross-section is more or less compensated for by the change in acceptance of the selection cuts, so both the signal and background rates are assumed here to be independent of \(m_{\PH}\).

### The \(\mathrm{H}\to\mathrm{ZZ}^{(*)}\to 4\ell\) channel

As for the \(\mathrm{h}\to\gamma\gamma\) and \(\mathrm{h}\to\mathrm{b}\overline{\mathrm{b}}\) channels, the observability in the MSSM of the \(\mathrm{H}\to\mathrm{ZZ}^{(*)}\to 4\ell\) channel is extrapolated from the detailed studies performed in the SM case, which are documented in the TP and in [3], but also in [16], [17] and [18] for more recent results.

For the intermediate mass range, \(120<m_{\mathrm{H}}<2m_{\mathrm{Z}}\), the signal rates are small and the background rates are potentially very large. In particular, the reducible \(\mathrm{t}\overline{\mathrm{t}}\) and \(\mathrm{Z}\mathrm{b}\overline{\mathrm{b}}\) backgrounds can only be brought down to a level well below the irreducible \(\mathrm{ZZ}^{*}/\gamma^{*}\) background by a combination of strong isolation and impact parameter cuts. For this reason, the overall signal reconstruction efficiency is \(\sim 40\%\) at low luminosity, corresponding to a reconstruction efficiency of 90% per lepton, an efficiency of 85% for the lepton isolation cuts, an efficiency of 95% for the four-lepton mass reconstruction in the chosen mass bin, and an efficiency of 90% for losses due to internal bremsstrahlung [17], which were not included in the TP. This overall efficiency of 40% drops to 24% at high luminosity, due to the lower efficiency of the lepton isolation cuts. Table 32 gives updated estimates at low and high luminosity for the signal and background rates as well as for the expected significances, which were computed as discussed in Section 4.

For the range of masses accessible in the MSSM case above the \(\mathrm{ZZ}\) threshold, \(2m_{\mathrm{Z}}<m_{\mathrm{H}}<400\) GeV (see Section 3.2), the only significant background arises from irreducible \(\mathrm{ZZ}\) continuum production. The overall signal reconstruction efficiency is thus significantly higher, \(\sim 59\%\), corresponding to a reconstruction efficiency of 90% per lepton and an efficiency of 90% for the four-lepton mass reconstruction within the chosen mass bin. In the SM case, for which the Higgs-boson width increases rapidly as \(m_{\mathrm{H}}\) increases, this mass bin was chosen to be \(m_{\mathrm{H}}\,\pm\,1.64\sqrt{(\Gamma_{\mathrm{H}}^{\mathrm{tot}}/2.36)^{2}+ \sigma_{m}{}^{2}}\), where \(\sigma_{m}\) is the expected experimental mass resolution [3]. Since, however, the MSSM \(\mathrm{H}\)-boson width remains much narrower than the experimental resolution over the relevant region of parameter space (see Section 2.6), the mass bin chosen for the MSSM case is narrower, \(m_{\mathrm{H}}\,\pm\,1.64\,\sigma_{m}\), where \(\sigma_{m}/m_{\mathrm{H}}\sim 1.5\%\) was estimated from recent studies using full simulation for the \(H\,\to\,4e\) channel and from updated detailed parametrisations of the overall muon momentum resolution for the \(H\,\to\,4\mu\) channel [18]. The expected signal and background rates and the expected significances at low and high luminosity are given in Table 33, extrapolated from Table 38 of [3].

As shown in some detail in Section 3.2, the MSSM \(\mathrm{H}\to\mathrm{ZZ}^{(*)}\to 4\ell\) rates are strongly suppressed with respect to the SM case (except for values of \(\tan\beta\) smaller than unity). This limits the observability of this channel to \(m_{\mathrm{H}}<2m_{\mathrm{t}}\) and to low values of \(\tan\beta\). The expected 5\(\sigma\)-discovery contour curves are shown in Figs. 48 to 51 in the usual way. The highest possible integrated luminosity is needed in this channel and the observability of the signal depends strongly on the value of \(m_{\mathrm{t}}\), as shown in Figs. 49 and 51.

If a signal were to be observed in this channel, the measured signal rate would provide the best tool to understand its origin, since the \(\PH\to\ZZ^{(*)}\to 4\ell\) MSSM rates are suppressed by an order of magnitude with respect to the SM case over most of the parameter space, and would allow a measurement of the value of \(\tan\beta\) with an accuracy of \(\pm 10\) to 15%, for an integrated luminosity of \(3\cdot 10^{5}\) pb\({}^{-1}\). For values of \(m_{\PH}\) larger than \(\sim 250\) GeV, the measured signal width would also provide a handle to disentangle the SM case (\(\Gamma_{\PH}^{\tt tot}\sim 10\) GeV) from the MSSM case (\(\Gamma_{\PH}^{\tt tot}\ <1\) GeV).

### The H/A \(\rightarrow\tau\tau\) channel

In the SM case, a signal from \(\mathrm{H}\rightarrow\tau\tau\) decays cannot be observed experimentally at the LHC because the signal rates are too low with respect to the large backgrounds [19]. However, as explained in Sections 3.4 and 3.5, the MSSM \(\mathrm{H}\rightarrow\tau\tau\) and \(\mathrm{A}\rightarrow\tau\tau\) rates are strongly enhanced with respect to the SM case over a large region of the parameter space. For low values of tan \(\beta\), the \(gg\ \rightarrow\ A\), \(\mathrm{A}\rightarrow\tau\tau\) rates are dominant and significantly larger than in the SM case. For large values of tan \(\beta\), the production is dominated by \(\mathrm{b}\bar{\mathrm{b}}\mathrm{H}\) and \(\mathrm{b}\bar{\mathrm{b}}\mathrm{A}\), and the \(\mathrm{H}\rightarrow\tau\tau\) rates are very similar to the \(\mathrm{A}\rightarrow\tau\tau\) ones. As discussed below, for \(m_{\mathrm{A}}>150\) GeV, the H- and A-bosons are degenerate in mass (see Section 2), so the signal rates in the \(\tau\tau\) channel can be added, whereas a more complicated procedure depending on the experimental resolution and on the mass difference \(m_{\mathrm{H}}\) - \(m_{\mathrm{A}}\) has to be applied for \(m_{\mathrm{A}}<150\) GeV. Higgs boson masses below 100 GeV have not been considered in this channel because of the large resonant background from \(\mathrm{Z}\rightarrow\tau\tau\) decays.

As discussed in the TP and in the detailed studies reported in [20], this channel requires excellent \(\tau\) identification to suppress the huge QCD-jet backgrounds from various sources, but also excellent \(E_{T}^{\mathrm{miss}}\) resolution [21] for the reconstruction of the \(\tau\tau\) invariant mass. One of the \(\tau\)-leptons is required to decay leptonically to trigger the experiment. The other \(\tau\)-lepton is then required to decay either to another lepton (lepton-lepton channel) or to a single charged hadron (lepton-hadron channel). The lepton-hadron channel turns out to provide the best sensitivity to a possible signal, due both to its larger rate and to the more favourable kinematics of the \(\tau\)-decay.

The background, a mixture of \(\mathrm{t}\overline{\mathrm{t}}\), \(\mathrm{b}\overline{\mathrm{b}}\), \(\mathrm{W}+\mathrm{jets}\) and \(\mathrm{Z}\), can be significantly reduced by appropriate kinematic cuts based on the reconstructed lepton, on the \(\tau\)-jet and on \(E_{T}^{\mathrm{miss}}\). After all cuts, \(\mathrm{t}\overline{\mathrm{t}}\) decays amount to only 10 to 20% of the total background, which is dominated by \(\mathrm{W}+\mathrm{jet}\) and \(\mathrm{b}\overline{\mathrm{b}}\) events (and Z-decays for the lower values of \(m_{\mathrm{H}}\) and \(m_{\mathrm{A}}\)). Therefore, the background estimates in this channel were assumed to be independent of \(m_{\mathrm{t}}\), since the smaller \(\mathrm{t}\overline{\mathrm{t}}\) cross-section is more or less compensated for by the larger acceptance of the selection cuts as \(m_{\mathrm{t}}\) increases.

The full simulation studies of the expected \(\tau\tau\) mass resolution as a function of \(m_{\mathrm{H}}\) and \(m_{\mathrm{A}}\)[20] have since been extended to lower (100 and 120 GeV) and higher (400 and 500 GeV) mass values. The mass resolution increases from 12 GeV to 50 GeV if the Higgs-boson mass increases from 100 GeV to 500 GeV. Table 34 shows the expected signal and background rates as a function of \(m_{\mathrm{A}}\), for \(\mathrm{A}\rightarrow\tau\tau\) decays and for tan \(\beta=10\), as well as the expected significances at low and high luminosity. These numbers have been obtained from full simulation and reconstruction of \(gg\to A\rightarrow\tau\tau\) decays. Since the dominant production process for large values of tan \(\beta\) in this channel is from \(\mathrm{b}\bar{\mathrm{b}}\mathrm{A}\) production, the acceptance and reconstruction efficiency for this subprocess are presently also under study. The results of this studymay decrease somewhat the sensitivity in this channel due to the smaller average \(\mathrm{p_{T}}\) of the produced A-boson.

At high luminosity, although the \(\tau\) identification efficiency can be maintained at its low-luminosity value of \(\sim 26\%\), the sensitivity to this channel is significantly degraded due to pile-up effects for the following two main reasons:

* the fraction of cases where the neutrino system can be resolved [19] decreases by 30%;
* the \(\tau\tau\) mass resolution is degraded by a factor \(\sim 1.5\).

As a consequence, high-luminosity operation with \(10^{5}\) pb\({}^{-1}\) is expected to only slightly improve the sensitivity to a possible signal with respect to low-luminosity operation with \(3\cdot 10^{4}\) pb\({}^{-1}\), as shown in Table 34.

The significances obtained from Table 34 for the A-boson are then combined with those expected for the H-boson. For \(m_{\mathrm{A}}>150\) GeV, the significance values of Table 34 are approximately doubled since the \(\mathrm{H}\rightarrow\tau\tau\) and \(\mathrm{A}\rightarrow\tau\tau\) rates are very similar and the two bosons are degenerate in mass. For \(m_{\mathrm{A}}<150\) GeV, the H- and A-boson masses can no longer be considered to be degenerate with respect to the experimental resolution and the combined significance for both channels is estimated as

\[\sqrt{(S/\sqrt{B})_{A}^{2}~{}+~{}(S/\sqrt{B})_{H}^{2}~{}-2\epsilon~{}(S/\sqrt {B})_{A}~{}(S/\sqrt{B})_{H}},\]

where \(\epsilon\) was estimated from the results of the full simulation to be \(\epsilon=-0.33\) for \(|m_{\mathrm{H}}-m_{\mathrm{A}}|/\sigma_{m}=1.4\) (obviously \(\epsilon\sim-1\) for \(|m_{\mathrm{H}}-m_{\mathrm{A}}|/\sigma_{m}\sim 0\) and \(\epsilon\sim 0\) for \(|m_{\mathrm{H}}-m_{\mathrm{A}}|/\sigma_{m}~{}\gg 2\)).

The expected \(5\sigma\)-discovery contour curves for the combined \(\mathrm{H}/\mathrm{A}\rightarrow\tau\tau\) signal are shown in Figs. 52 to 55. Fig. 52 shows that, even for a moderate integrated luminosity of \(3\cdot 10^{4}\) pb\({}^{-1}\), a signal should be observed over a large region of the \((m_{\mathrm{A}},\tan\beta)\) plane. This region can be substantially increased only for the largest integrated luminosities achievable with high luminosity operation, due to the degraded detector performance at high luminosity discussed above. Fig. 53 shows that the observability of this channel does not vary much as a function of \(m_{\mathrm{t}}\). As already mentioned, for low values of \(\tan\beta\), the signal can be observed only in the \(\mathrm{A}\rightarrow\tau\tau\) channel, and the sensitivity to the signal disappears for \(m_{\mathrm{A}}>2m_{\mathrm{t}}\), where \(\mathrm{A}\rightarrow\mathrm{t}\overline{\mathrm{t}}\) decays become dominant. The shapes of the \(5\sigma\)-discovery contour curves as a function of \(m_{\mathrm{t}}\) shown in Fig. 55 reflect the variation in the relationship between \(m_{\mathrm{A}}\) and \(m_{\mathrm{h}}\) as a function of \(m_{\mathrm{t}}\).

Finally, it should be noted that, as in the case of \(\rm H\to ZZ^{(\star)}\to 4\ell\) decays, a measurement of the signal rate should provide good sensitivity to \(\tan\beta\) in this channel. As an example, for \(m_{\rm A}=150\) GeV and an integrated luminosity of \(3\cdot 10^{5}\) pb\({}^{-1}\), \(\tan\beta\) can be measured to an accuracy of \(\pm 5\%\) for \(\tan\beta=5\) and of \(\pm 13\%\) for \(\tan\beta=40\) (a systematic uncertainty of \(\pm 10\%\) was assumed for the measured signal rate).

### The \(\mathrm{H}\to\mathrm{h}\mathrm{h}\) channel

The observation of this channel would be particularly interesting, since it would correspond to the simultaneous discovery of two Higgs bosons. Possible final states of interest are:

1. \(\mathrm{H}\to\mathrm{h}\mathrm{h}\to\mathrm{b}\mathrm{\overline{b}}\mathrm{\ }\mathrm{b} \mathrm{\overline{b}}\). This would provide the largest signal rate, but would require a 4-jet trigger with as low a \(\mathrm{p}_{\mathrm{T}}\)-threshold as possible. Such a trigger is at present under study [23], as is the possibility of triggering on one low-\(\mathrm{p}_{\mathrm{T}}\) muon from B-decay plus three additional jets. The b-tagging performance needed to control the overwhelming backgrounds from 4-jet events should be evaluated, as well as the irreducible \(\mathrm{b}\mathrm{\overline{b}}\mathrm{\ }\mathrm{b}\mathrm{\overline{b}}\) continuum background [24];
2. \(\mathrm{H}\to\mathrm{h}\mathrm{h}\to\mathrm{b}\mathrm{\overline{b}}\)\(\tau\tau\). At least one lepton from \(\tau\)-decay would be required to trigger the experiment, and the mass reconstruction of the \(\tau\tau\)-pair would follow that described for \(\mathrm{H}/\mathrm{A}\to\tau\tau\) decays. The dominant backgrounds would be from \(\mathrm{t}\mathrm{\overline{t}}\) and \(\mathrm{W}\)+jet production;
3. \(\mathrm{H}\to\mathrm{h}\mathrm{h}\to\mathrm{b}\mathrm{\overline{b}}\)\(\gamma\gamma\). This channel was the only one studied for this note, because it can be easily triggered upon and it offers good kinematic constraints for the reconstruction of \(m_{\mathrm{H}}\). For this reason, the study was extended to values of \(m_{\mathrm{h}}\) as low as 60 GeV. Details can be found in Appendix C.

The signal was extracted by requiring two isolated photons, with \(|\eta|<2.5\) and \(\mathrm{p}_{\mathrm{T}}>20\) GeV, and two additional jets with \(|\eta|<2.5\) and \(\mathrm{p}_{\mathrm{T}}>15\) GeV (resp. \(\mathrm{p}_{\mathrm{T}}>30\) GeV) at low (resp. high) luminosity. At least one of these jets was required to be tagged as a b-jet with an assumed efficiency \(\epsilon_{b}=60\%\) (resp. 50%) at low (resp. high) luminosity. Events were accepted if the diphoton mass was within \(\pm 2\) GeV of \(m_{\mathrm{h}}\), and if the dijet mass was within \(\pm 20\) GeV of \(m_{\mathrm{h}}\) - 20 GeV (no correction to the reconstructed dijet mass was applied in this study). Finally, after rescaling the photon and jet 4-momenta appropriately by applying a constraint on \(m_{\mathrm{h}}\), the \(\gamma\gamma\)jj invariant mass was required to be within \(\pm 10\) GeV of \(m_{\mathrm{H}}\).

Several background sources were considered: irreducible \(\mathrm{b}\mathrm{\overline{b}}\)\(\gamma\gamma\) and reducible \(\mathrm{bj}\gamma\gamma\), \(\mathrm{c}\mathrm{\overline{c}}\)\(\gamma\gamma\), \(\mathrm{c}\mathrm{j}\gamma\gamma\) and \(\mathrm{jj}\gamma\gamma\), which were all estimated using PYTHIA. Large uncertainties apply to these background estimates, due to the poor knowledge of the total \(\mathrm{b}\mathrm{\overline{b}}\), \(\mathrm{c}\mathrm{\overline{c}}\) and \(\mathrm{jj}\) cross-sections, and to the procedure used to simulate photon bremsstrahlung in these processes.

The expected signal rates are very low, even when requiring only one of the two jets in the final state to be tagged as a b-jet. The \(\mathrm{H}\to\mathrm{h}\mathrm{h}\) channel can be observed only for low values of tan \(\beta\) and for \(200<m_{\mathrm{H}}<400\) GeV. A few examples of the expected signal and background rates after selection cuts and of the significances at low and high luminosity are given in Table 36. For a given value of \(m_{\mathrm{H}}\), the corresponding value of \(m_{\mathrm{h}}\) increases as tan \(\beta\) increases, and the background rate therefore varies. The sensitivity to the signal for a

### The H/A \(\rightarrow\) tt channel

Because of the strong couplings of the SM Higgs boson to gauge boson pairs, the \(\PH\rightarrow\) tt branching ratio is too small for this channel to be observable in the SM case. In the MSSM case, however, the \(\PH\to\) tt and \(\PH\rightarrow\) tt branching ratios are close to 100% for \(m_{\PH},m_{\PH}>2m_{\PH}\) and for \(\tan\beta\sim 1\). The \(\PH\rightarrow\) tt and \(\PH\rightarrow\) tt decays cannot be distinguished experimentally from each other, since the H- and A-bosons are almost degenerate in mass in the relevant region of parameter space. As discussed in the literature [25], a signal from \(\PH\)/A \(\rightarrow\) tt decays would only appear as a peak in the tt invariant mass spectrum above the tt continuum background for values of \(m_{\PH}\) and \(m_{\PH}\) smaller than \(\sim 500\) GeV, due to negative interference effects between the signal and background amplitudes.

The results of a detailed particle-level simulation of this channel are presented in Appendix D and summarised here. The signal was extracted by searching for \(\PW\bbbar\) final states, with one \(\PW\rightarrow\ell\nu\) and one \(\PW\rightarrow\jj\) decay. The lepton was required to have \(\pt>20\) GeV and all the jets, i.e. those from \(\PW\)-decay and the two b-jets, were required to have \(\pt>40\) GeV. It was assumed that the experiment could trigger on such topologies and efficiently reconstruct them at low and high luminosities. Both b-jets were required to be tagged, with an assumed efficiency \(\epsilon_{b}=60\%\) (resp. 50%) at low (resp. high) luminosity.

Both top-quark decays were fully reconstructed and a constraint on \(m_{\PH}\) was used to improve the experimental resolution on the invariant mass. The expected mass resolution for \(\PH\)/A \(\rightarrow\) tt decays increases from 40 to 80 GeV as \(m_{\PH}\) and \(m_{\PH}\) increase from 400 to 500 GeV.

The background from continuum production is much larger than the \(\PW\)+jet background after these selection cuts, and is unfortunately also much larger than the signal, as shown in Table 37. The signal-to-background ratio varies between 1.5% and 7% over the range of Higgs boson and top-quark masses considered.

The mass resolutions quoted above imply that a typical mass window allowing to observe most of the signal would be between 150 and 300 GeV. With such wide mass windows, the signal can only be observed above the continuum background as an excess of events. This excess would be very significant statistically, as shown in Table 37, but this significance would only be meaningful if the theoretical uncertainties on the continuum background shape were lower than a percent or so.

### The \(\mathbf{A\to Zh}\) channel

The observation of this channel would be particularly interesting, since it would correspond to the simultaneous discovery of two Higgs bosons. It is the dominant A-boson decay channel for low values of \(\tan\beta\) and for \(m_{\mathrm{Z}}\) + \(m_{\mathrm{h}}<m_{\mathrm{A}}<2m_{\mathrm{t}}\). Possible final states of interest are:

1. \(\mathrm{A\to Zh\to b\overline{b}\ \mathrm{b\overline{b}}\,\ similarly to\ \mathrm{H\to hh decays}\) (see Section 5.6). This would provide the largest signal rate, but would require a 4-jet trigger with as low a \(\mathrm{p_{T}}\)-threshold as possible. Such a trigger is at present under study [23], as is the possibility of triggering on one low-\(\mathrm{p_{T}}\) muon from B-decay plus three additional jets. The b-tagging performance needed to control the overwhelming backgrounds from 4-jet events should be evaluated, as well as the irreducible \(\mathrm{b\overline{b}\ \mathrm{b\overline{b}}\ }\) continuum background [24];
2. \(\mathrm{A\to Zh\to\ell\ell b\overline{b}\.}\) This channel was the only one studied for this note, because it can be easily triggered upon and it offers the largest rates apart from the dominant channel discussed above. Details can be found in Appendix E;
3. \(\mathrm{A\to Zh\to\ell\ell\gamma\gamma}\). This channel would provide better kinematic constraints in the final state than the preceding one, but the expected rates are too low for it to be observable at the LHC.

The signal was extracted by requiring two isolated leptons, with \(|\eta|<2.5\) and \(\mathrm{p_{T}}>20\) GeV, and two additional jets with \(|\eta|<2.5\) and \(\mathrm{p_{T}}>15\) GeV (resp. \(\mathrm{p_{T}}>30\) GeV) at low (resp. high) luminosity. Both jets were required to be tagged as b-jets with an assumed efficiency \(\epsilon_{b}=60\%\) (resp. \(50\%\)) at low (resp. high) luminosity. Events were accepted if the dilepton mass was within \(\pm 6\) GeV of \(m_{\mathrm{Z}}\), and if the dijet mass was within \(\pm 20\) GeV of \(m_{\mathrm{h}}\) - 20 GeV (no correction to the reconstructed dijet mass was applied in this study). Finally, after rescaling the lepton and jet 4-momenta appropriately by applying constraints on \(m_{\mathrm{Z}}\) and \(m_{\mathrm{h}}\), the \(\ell\ell\mathrm{jj}\) invariant mass was required to be within \(\pm 6\) GeV of \(m_{\mathrm{A}}\). Several background sources were considered: irreducible \(\mathrm{Zb\overline{b}}\) and \(\mathrm{ZZ}\), and reducible \(\mathrm{ZW}\), \(\mathrm{Zjj}\) and \(\mathrm{t\overline{t}}\). After the selection cuts, the \(\mathrm{Zb\overline{b}}\) and \(\mathrm{t\overline{t}}\) backgrounds are dominant (see Appendix E).

The expected signal rates decrease very rapidly as \(\tan\beta\) increases. The \(\mathrm{A\to Zh}\) channel can therefore only be observed for low values of \(\tan\beta\) and for \(200<m_{\mathrm{A}}<2m_{\mathrm{t}}\). A few examples of the expected signal and background rates after selection cuts and of the significances at low and high luminosity are given in Table 38. For a given value of \(m_{\mathrm{A}}\), the corresponding value of \(m_{\mathrm{h}}\) increases as \(\tan\beta\) increases, and the background rate therefore varies. The sensitivity to the signal for a given value of \(m_{\mathrm{A}}\) was estimated for two different values of \(m_{\mathrm{h}}\), and a simple linear interpolation or extrapolation was performed to obtain the \(5\sigma\)-discovery contour curves in the \((m_{\mathrm{A}},\tan\beta)\) and \((m_{\mathrm{h}},\tan\beta)\) planes shown in Figs. 67 to 70.

### The \(\PH\to\tau\nu\) channel

Charged Higgs boson production at the LHC can occur through \(\ttbar\) production followed by \(\tt\to H^{+}b\) decay or through Drell-Yan pair production. The latter is unfortunately much smaller in rate and much more difficult to extract from the huge QCD backgrounds. The results presented here are therefore based on the studies performed for the TP [26] with full simulation of \(\tt\to H^{+}b\) decays and their dominant backgrounds.

This study concentrated on the search in \(\ttbar\) events for an excess of \(\tau\)-leptons from \(\PH\to\tau\nu\) decay with respect to the expected \(\tau\)-lepton rate from \(\PW\to\tau\nu\) decay. The charged Higgs boson mass cannot be directly reconstructed, because several neutrinos are produced in the final states of interest.

Large samples of \(\ttbar\) events can be triggered on by requiring one isolated high-\(\ttp_{T}\) lepton within \(|\eta|<2.5\). The additional requirement of at least three reconstructed jets with \(\pt>20\) GeV and \(|\eta|<2.5\), of which two are required to be tagged as b-jets, reduces the potentially large backgrounds from \(\PW+\jet\) and \(\bbbar\) production to a level well below the \(\ttbar\) signal itself. The dominant background is then the combinatorial background from fake and real \(\tau\)-leptons in \(\ttbar\) events. The selection cuts enhance the right-handed \(\tau\)-lepton signal from \(\PH\) decays with respect to that from \(\PW\) decay, and select mostly single-prong \(\tau\)-decays. As for the case of the \(\PH\) and \(\tau\tau\) decays discussed in Section 5.4, \(\tau\) identification is a key element in extracting a possible signal from the large combinatorial background from jets.

After the selection cuts and the \(\tau\) identification criteria have been applied, \(\tt\to H^{+}b\) decays appear as final states with an excess of events with one isolated \(\tau\)-lepton compared to those with an additional isolated electron or muon. Table 39 gives, for \(m_{\tt t}=150\), \(175\) and \(200\) GeV, the expected \(\tau\)-lepton excess rates from \(\tt t\to H^{+}b\) decay as a function of \(m_{\PH}\) as well as the summed background rates from real and fake \(\tau\)-leptons. As in the case of \(\PH\) and \(\tau\tau\) decays, these results were obtained from full simulation of the signal and background processes. As an example, for \(m_{\tt t}=175\) GeV, \(m_{\PH}=130\) GeV and \(\tan\beta=6\), an excess of \(\sim 1000\)\(\tau\)-leptons is expected from the charged Higgs boson signal, above a background of \(\sim 3000\)\(\tau\)-leptons from \(\PW\) decay, and of \(\sim 4000\) fake \(\tau\)-leptons.

When measuring such an excess, systematic uncertainties have to be taken into account. They arise mainly from the imperfect knowledge of the \(\tau\)-lepton efficiency and of the amount of fake \(\tau\)-leptons present in the final sample. They were assumed to be \(\sim\pm 3\%\) from past experience [27], and added to the statistical uncertainty to obtain the significances shown in Table 39. These systematic uncertainties dominate the overall uncertainty, and the sensitivity to a charged Higgs boson signal would not improve significantly with integrated luminosity unless increased statistics would result in improved systematic uncertainties. It is important to recall, as mentioned in Section 3.4.1, that these results do not take into account recent calculations [9], which include possible decays of the charged Higgs boson to SUSY particles and show

Conclusions and outlook

This Section is mainly devoted to presenting the results, as discussed in Section 5 for each signal channel separately, in a combined way, in order to obtain a more global perspective on the LHC discovery potential in the MSSM Higgs sector. It also discusses possible improvements and extensions of the studies done to date. The Figures presented below combine together the 5\(\sigma\)-discovery contour curves presented separately for each channel in Section 5 for different scenarios, i.e. for integrated luminosities of \(3\cdot 10^{4}\) pb\({}^{-1}\) or \(3\cdot 10^{5}\) pb\({}^{-1}\) and for the ATLAS experiment alone or the ATLAS and CMS experiments combined, under the assumptions described in Section 4. Colour PostScript versions of these Figures and of those shown in Section 5 are available on WWW 9.

Figs. 73 (ATLAS) and 74 (ATLAS+ CMS) show the combined 5\(\sigma\)-discovery contour curves for \(m_{\mathrm{t}}=175\) GeV and an integrated luminosity of \(3\cdot 10^{4}\) pb\({}^{-1}\), representative of the integrated luminosity at the LHC after three years of operation. Figs. 75 and 76 show the corresponding curves for an integrated luminosity of \(3\cdot 10^{5}\) pb\({}^{-1}\), representative of the ultimate integrated luminosity at the LHC after about 10 years of operation. All these Figures also display the LEP2 discovery potential for the upgraded machine energy of 192 GeV and for an integrated luminosity of 150 pb\({}^{-1}\) per experiment [8]. Although some theoretical arguments tend to favour small values of tan \(\beta\), the impression given by the choice of a logarithmic scale for tan \(\beta\) can be misleading, and Figs. 77 and 78 display the curves of Figs. 74 and 76 with a linear scale for tan \(\beta\). The importance of the combined h \(\to\gamma\gamma\) channel and of the H/A \(\to\tau\tau\) channel at the LHC thus appears more clearly.

As discussed in Section 2, the contour curves in these Figures can be affected significantly by changes in some of the parameters in the MSSM model. The most significant one is the value of \(m_{\mathrm{t}}\), as illustrated with a log- (resp. linear) scale for tan \(\beta\) by Figs. 79 for ATLAS, 80 (resp. 83) for ATLAS+CMS and for \(m_{\mathrm{t}}=150\) GeV, and Figs. 81 for ATLAS, 82 (resp. 84) for ATLAS+CMS and for \(m_{\mathrm{t}}=200\) GeV. As \(m_{\mathrm{t}}\) increases, the LEP2 discovery potential decreases, due to the larger value of \(m_{\mathrm{h}}\) at any given point in the (\(m_{\mathrm{A}}\), tan \(\beta\)) plane, whereas the LHC discovery potential increases significantly for some channels (h \(\to\gamma\gamma\) and H \(\to\) ZZ\({}^{(\star)}\to 4\ell\)), remains unchanged for others (H/A \(\to\tau\tau\) and A \(\to\) Zh \(\to\ell\overline{\ell}\mathrm{b}\overline{\mathrm{b}}\) ), or corresponds to somewhat different regions of the parameter space for the remaining channels. Nevertheless, the overall picture remains the same:

* the LEP2 discovery potential corresponds to \(\sim 10\)-\(20\%\) of the parameter space in a linear (\(m_{\mathrm{A}}\), tan \(\beta\)) plane. In most cases, the discovery of a Higgs boson at LEP2 would not in itself allow any discrimination between the SM case and the MSSM case;* with a modest integrated luminosity of \(3\cdot 10^{4}\) pb\({}^{-1}\), the LHC discovery potential corresponds to \(\sim 80\%\) of the parameter space. For 80% to 90% of the cases, the discovery of a Higgs boson at the LHC would allow discrimination between the SM case and the MSSM case;
* with the very high integrated luminosity of \(3\cdot 10^{5}\) pb\({}^{-1}\), the LHC discovery potential corresponds to the whole parameter space. For almost all cases, the experiments would be able to distinguish between the SM case and the MSSM case. In Fig. 76, the region with \(m_{\rm A}>250\) GeV and \(4<\tan\beta<5\)-10 is only covered by the \(\rm h\to\gamma\gamma\) channel. However, as discussed below, \(\rm h\to b\overline{b}\) decays from SUSY particle decays should be observable above background in this region for many cases, thus providing a direct evidence for SUSY. In the case of the simultaneous discovery of light \(\rm h\)- and \(\rm A\)-bosons at LEP2, essentially only the charged Higgs boson would be seen directly in top-quark decays at the LHC. In the more likely case of the discovery of one light \(\rm h\)-boson at LEP2, several Higgs bosons would then be observed at the LHC;
* more generally, all three neutral Higgs bosons would be discovered at the LHC over \(\sim 60\%\) of the parameter space, i.e. for \(m_{\rm A}>160\) GeV, but over most of this region the \(\rm H\)- and \(\rm A\)-bosons are degenerate in mass and would be very difficult to separate. Over \(\sim 10\%\) of the parameter space, i.e. for \(\tan\beta>2\) and \(90<m_{\rm A}<130\) GeV, the two heavy neutral Higgs bosons and the charged Higgs boson would be discovered at the LHC;
* over \(\sim 5\%\) of the parameter space, i.e. for \(130<m_{\rm A}<160\) GeV and \(\tan\beta>3\), only the \(\rm H/A\to\tau\tau\) channel seems to be observable at the LHC at this stage. However, as can be seen from Fig. 74, the \(\rm W\)h channel with \(\rm W\to\ell\nu\) and \(\rm h\to b\overline{b}\) decay provides sensitivity in this region for values of \(\tan\beta\) as high as \(\sim 5\) for an integrated luminosity of \(3\cdot 10^{4}\) pb\({}^{-1}\). Work is in progress to assess the observability of this channel at high luminosity, but also to determine whether the \(\rm t\overline{t}\) h channel could be useful to improve the sensitivity even further in this region of parameter space;
* the various channels described in Section 5 have also been studied for values of \(\tan\beta\) smaller than 1. Even if such values are disfavoured for theoretical reasons, it is important to assess the experimental sensitivity, and each channel was studied for \(0.3<\tan\beta<2\) and for \(m_{\rm t}=175\) GeV, as shown in Figs. 85 to 92, for ATLAS with an integrated luminosity of \(3\cdot 10^{5}\) pb\({}^{-1}\). These Figures show that, in contrast to LEP2, which has very little sensitivity to values of \(\tan\beta\) below \(\sim 0.8\), the sensitivity at LHC is quite good for most channels of interest in this region of very low values of \(\tan\beta\);Figure 73: _For m\({}_{*}\) = 175 GeV and an integrated luminosity of \(3\cdot 10^{4}\) pb\({}^{-1}\), ATLAS \(5\sigma\)-discovery contour curves in the (m\({}_{\rm A}\), tan \(\beta\)) plane for all Higgs boson signals discussed in Section 5._

* the overall discovery potential can also be displayed in the (\(m_{\rm h}\), tan\(\beta\)) plane, as shown in Fig. 93 for ATLAS with an integrated luminosity of \(3\cdot 10^{5}\) pb\({}^{-1}\) and for \(m_{\rm t}=175\) GeV. This choice of parameter plane, although relevant for LEP2, where most of the sensitivity is related to the h-boson, is not the best one for displaying the LHC potential, because large masses of the other Higgs bosons are all collapsed on top of the line delimiting the maximum allowed value of \(m_{\rm h}\). However, Fig. 93 shows that, for tan\(\beta>5\) and for \(82<m_{\rm h}<95\) GeV, a discovery of the h-boson through its direct production is impossible at the LHC (see below for a discussion of h-boson discovery through decays of SUSY particles);
* many Higgs boson couplings will be measured at LHC, but with an accuracy not likely to be better than 10-20%, since in most cases these measurements will be based on signal rates. A measurement of obvious interest will be that of the Higgs boson couplings to the top quark, either through the observation of \(\rm t\bar{t}\) production with \(\rm h\to b\bar{b}\) decay, or through the observation of \(\rm H/A\to t\bar{t}\) decays;
* none of the above conclusions are strongly affected by changes in the model parameters, even if many of the discovery curves change significantly as a function of \(m_{\rm t}\). It is important to recall here that all SUSY particle masses were set to 1 TeV for this study. In some specific cases, the exact choice of the SUSY particle mass spectrum does affect the Higgs boson production cross-sections and/or decay branching ratios, and therefore the discovery potential, as discussed in [8] and in the previous Sections. In particular, preliminary studies based on Minimal Supergravity (SUGRA) Models [28] indicate that the two heavy neutral Higgs bosons and the charged Higgs boson will in many cases have masses larger than 500 GeV, i.e. outside the parameter space studied here, and that, for given values of \(m_{\rm A}\) and tan\(\beta\), many different values of \(m_{\rm h}\) are allowed, depending on the exact mass spectrum of SUSY particles.

A better understanding of the observability of the MSSM Higgs sector at the LHC needs more work in some specific channels which involve b-jet tagging, such as \(\rm h\to b\bar{b}\) decays from associated \(\rm W\) and \(\rm t\bar{t}\) production, \(\rm H\to hh\to b\bar{b}\)\(b\bar{b}\) decays, \(\rm A\to Zh\to b\bar{b}\)\(b\bar{b}\) decays, \(\rm H/A\to t\bar{t}\) decays and possibly bbh, bbH and bbA production resulting in final states with four b-jets. But, more importantly, it needs work to understand the interplay between the SUSY particle sector and the Higgs sector. This work can be done in the context of Minimal SUGRA models, which only have a limited set of parameters.

In conclusion, it is clear that the MSSM Higgs sector is extremely challenging for the LHC experiments and therefore provides an excellent set of benchmark processes to optimise the detector design and performance. Thisis the case for the electromagnetic calorimeter and muon system resolution, for the b-tagging efficiency, for the \(\tau\)-lepton identification, the \(E_{T}^{\rm miss}\) resolution and also for the hadronic calorimetry in the reconstruction of multijet final states.

The MSSM is however only one model among many and the theoretical predictions based on this model should not be the dominant input into the LHC detector design nor preclude the possibility of investigating other more exotic scenarios. In particular, the Higgs boson signals discussed throughout this study would not provide direct evidence for SUSY, which could only arise from the discovery of supersymmetric particles themselves.
