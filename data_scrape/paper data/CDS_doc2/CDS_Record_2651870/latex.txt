## 1 Introduction

In the Standard Model (SM) the production of four top quarks (\(t\bar{t}t\bar{t}\)) is a very rare process with an expected cross-section of \(\sigma(pp\to t\bar{t}t\bar{t})=15.83^{+18\%}_{-21\%}\) fb at 14 TeV [1]. This process has not been observed. Many theories beyond the SM predict an enhancement of the \(t\bar{t}t\bar{t}\) cross-section; examples include gluino pair production in supersymmetric models [2], pair production of scalar gluons [3, 4], and production of a heavy pseudoscalar or scalar boson in association with a \(t\bar{t}\) pair in Type II two-Higgs-doublet models (2HDM) [5, 6]. In the context of Effective Field Theories, the \(t\bar{t}t\bar{t}\) cross-section uniquely constrains the four-top-quark effective operators [7].

Four top quark production has been searched for at \(\sqrt{s}=13\) TeV by the ATLAS and CMS experiments in the final states where one top quark decays leptonically (meaning to an electron or muon) [8, 9] and where at least two top quarks decay leptonically [10, 11]. The latter final state has a lower branching fraction but has lower background contamination when the two leptons have the same charge.

After the end of Run 3, the LHC will be upgraded to the High-Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC), significantly increasing its instantaneous luminosity. Upgrades of the ATLAS detector will be necessary to maintain its performance in the higher luminosity environment and to mitigate the impact of radiation damage and detector aging [12]. A new inner tracking system, extending the tracking region from pseudorapidity1\(|\eta|<2.7\) up to \(|\eta|<4\), will provide the ability to reconstruct forward charged particle tracks, which can be matched to calorimeter clusters for forward electron reconstruction, or associated to forward jets. The inner tracker extension also enables muon identification at high pseudorapidities if additional detectors are installed in the region \(2.7<|\eta|<4\).

Footnote 1: ATLAS uses a right-handed coordinate system with its origin at the nominal interaction point (IP) in the centre of the detector and the \(z\)-axis along the beam pipe. The \(x\)-axis points from the IP to the centre of the LHC ring, and the \(y\)-axis points upward. Cylindrical coordinates (\(r,\phi\)) are used in the transverse plane, \(\phi\) being the azimuthal angle around the \(z\)-axis. The pseudorapidity is defined in terms of the polar angle \(\theta\) as \(\eta=-\ln\tan(\theta/2)\), and the rapidity \(y\) is defined as \(y=\frac{1}{2}\ln\frac{E+p_{z}}{E-p_{z}}\).

This note presents the prospect for measuring the SM \(t\bar{t}t\bar{t}\) cross-section in the context of the HL-LHC with 3000 fb\({}^{-1}\) of proton-proton collisions at \(\sqrt{s}=14\) TeV with the ATLAS experiment. Events with two same-charge leptons, and at least three leptons with at least five jets among which at least two are identified as originating from the hadronization of a \(b\)-quark (\(b\)-jet) are analyzed.

## 2 Simulated Samples

Samples that can give rise to two leptons with a same charge or at least three leptons are used. Monte Carlo (MC) samples for \(t\bar{t}t\bar{t}\), \(t\bar{t}\), single-top quarks (both \(Wt\) and t-channels), a vector boson (\(W\) or \(Z\)) or a Higgs boson in association with \(t\bar{t}\), and multiboson production are processed. They are generated at \(\sqrt{s}=14\) TeV and normalised to their theoretical cross-sections and to a luminosity of 3000 fb\({}^{-1}\). Only for the \(t\bar{t}H\) process, the sample generated at \(\sqrt{s}=13\) TeV is used while it is still normalised to the SM 14 TeV cross-section.

The \(t\bar{t}t\bar{t}\) sample was generated at leading order in QCD with MG5_aMC@NLO v2.2.3 [13] and Pythia 8 (v8.186) [14] using the NNPDF2.3LO PDF set [15]. A sample of \(t\bar{t}\) events was generated using PowhegBox [16] and Pythia 8 using the NNPDF3.0NLO PDF set. Single-top quarks events were generated using Powheg-Box and Pythia 6 (v6.428). The \(t\bar{t}Z/W\) samples were generated using MG5_aMC@NLO and Pythia 8 while multiboson events were generated using Sherpa [17]. The \(t\bar{t}\) and single-top quarksMC samples are used to model the background with fake, non-prompt or charge mis-identified leptons. This background is difficult to simulate, and it is usually evaluated with data-driven methods. For the purposes of this study, the normalisation of these samples is scaled based on the observed fake/non-prompt background fraction in the published Run 2 analysis of Ref. [10], as will be described in Section 4.

## 3 Object reconstruction and event selection

After the event generation step, a fast simulation of the trigger and detector effects is added with the dedicated ATLAS software framework [18]. The trigger, reconstruction and identification efficiencies, as well as the momentum/energy resolution of leptons and jets, are computed as function of their \(\eta\) and \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) using simulation assuming an upgraded ATLAS detector [12], and are tabulated with functions which provide parameterised estimates of the ATLAS performance at the HL-LHC. These functions are then applied to the particle-level quantities. The functions assume the HL-LHC conditions of an instantaneous luminosity of \(\mathcal{L}=10^{34}\) cm\({}^{-2}\) s\({}^{-1}\) which implies an average number of additional collisions per bunch-crossing 200. More details on the object smearing and the corresponding performance can be found in Ref. [19].

Electrons and muons are reconstructed in the fiducial region of transverse momentum \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>25\) GeV and \(|\eta|<2.5\). Because of the \(t\bar{t}t\bar{t}\) signal topology, no significant gain is obtained by extending the \(\eta\) range for the leptons. Jets are selected with \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>25\) GeV, in the range \(|\eta|<4\). Leptons are required to be isolated, using the sum of the transverse energies of the charged and neutral truth particles within \(\Delta R=\sqrt{(\Delta\eta)^{2}+(\Delta\phi)^{2}}<0.2\) around the lepton, denoted by \(etcone20\). This amount of energy divided by the lepton \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) is required to be \(<0.23(0.11)\) for electron (muon) candidates. The collection of selected jets includes simulated pileup effects. A track-based pileup jet rejection technique is simulated, assuming 2% efficiency to select a pileup jet as a hard-scatter jet. Jets containing \(b\)-hadrons are identified with a ghost-matching procedure [20] and are assigned \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\)- and \(\eta\)-dependent weights to reproduce a 70% \(b\)-tagging efficiency. The missing transverse momentum (\(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\)) is simulated with parameterized contributions to soft terms, which are calculated with tracks matched to the primary vertex that are not associated with any reconstructed objects.

Events are selected if they contain at least two leptons with the same charge (2l) or at least three leptons (3l). At least five jets among which at least two are \(b\)-tagged are required. The selected leptons are required to have \(\Delta R>0.2\) with respect to any selected jets. In case an event contains a pair of same-flavour opposite-charge leptons, the invariant mass of these two leptons is required to satisfy: \(|m_{ll}-91|>10\) GeV. In addition the scalar sum of the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) of all selected jets and leptons (\(H_{T}\)) is required to be >500 GeV and \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\) is required to be >40 GeV.

The distributions of \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\) and \(H_{T}\) are shown in Figure 1 after requiring two same-charge leptons or three leptons, at least 5 jets and at least 2 \(b\)-jets as preselection.

## 4 Analysis strategy

To extract the \(t\bar{t}t\bar{t}\) cross-section a fit is performed to the \(H_{T}\) distributions in several signal regions defined according to the jet and \(b\)-jet multiplicities. The analysis is fitting the \(t\bar{t}t\bar{t}\) cross-section normalised to the prediction from the SM (\(\mu\)). The definition of the signal regions is provided in Table 1.

The rate of the instrumental background (electron with mis-identified charge, fake lepton or non-prompt lepton) is difficult to estimate using MC, but it has been shown in the published Run 2 analysis of Ref. [10] that it mostly comes from \(t\bar{t}\) events. Therefore the fraction of instrumental background in the relevant regions with different lepton and \(b\)-tagged jet multiplicities observed in the Run 2analysis of Ref. [10] is used to scale the sum of \(t\bar{t}\) and single-top MC events in the current analysis. These fractions are assumed to be independent of the requirement on the number of jets while varying with the lepton and \(b\)-jet multiplicities. To increase the statistics used to build \(H_{T}\) template distributions for the fake background, \(t\bar{t}\) and single-top MC events are selected with a relaxed isolation criteria: \(etcone20/p_{\mathrm{T}}<1.0\) for both electrons and muons. If no \(t\bar{t}\) or single top MC events survive the selection, the \(H_{T}\) distribution from the next lower \(b\)-jet multiplicity region is used. These \(H_{T}\) templates are then scaled so that the fractions of fakes over the total background yield are: 44% for SR2l-6j3b, 32% for SR2l-6j4b, and 1.5% for SR3l-6j3b and SR3l-6j4b.

The number of events selected in the different signal regions are shown in Table 2 and in Figure 2.

The signal over background ratio in the different regions as well as pie charts representing the background composition are shown in Figures 3 and 4, respectively.

## 5 Systematic uncertainties

In the the published Run 2 analysis of Ref. [10], the main sources of systematic uncertainties were found to be the uncertainties on the fake lepton background and on the SM background cross-section normalisation. Therefore, in this study experimental uncertainties (e.g. on jet energy scale or \(b\)-tagging efficiency) have been neglected. The theoretical uncertainty on the predicted signal cross section enters the determination of \(\mu\) but not the uncertainty on the measured \(t\bar{t}t\bar{t}\) cross section. The following systematic uncertainties are taken into account in this analysis assuming increasing uncertainty with the jet and \(b\)-jet multiplicity. A 15% (7%) overall normalisation uncertainty is assigned on the \(t\bar{t}V\) (\(t\bar{t}H\)) backgrounds. In addition increasing uncertainties are assigned in the different signal regions as the relevant backgrounds come from \(t\bar{t}V\) and \(t\bar{t}H\) events with increasing number of jets: a 30% additional uncertainty is added on the \(t\bar{t}V\) and \(t\bar{t}H\) backgrounds in SR2l-6j3b, 40% in SR2l-6j4b and SR3l-6j3b and 50% in SR3l-6j4b. An overall shape uncertainty is added coming from scale variations, generator and parton shower variations corresponding to a 20% (10%) linear variation of the \(H_{T}\) distributions for \(t\bar{t}V\) (\(t\bar{t}H\)) events. As the instrumental background is estimated using scaling, a 30% uncertainty per signal region is assigned to it based on Run 2 analyses [10; 21]. A shape uncertainty of 20% per signal region is also assigned. No uncertainties related to the statistics of the MC samples used for the background estimation are applied. Finally a 10% uncertainty on the signal normalisation is assumed.

The systematic uncertainties are treated as nuisance parameters as described in Section 6. The input \(H_{T}\) distributions used in the fit to extract the \(t\bar{t}t\bar{t}\) cross-section are shown in Figure 5. The binning of these distributions is automatically determined to avoid bins with very low statistics while still keeping good significance.

## 6 Results

A maximum-likelihood fit of the \(H_{T}\) distributions is performed simultaneously in the six signal regions to extract the \(t\bar{t}t\bar{t}\) signal cross-section normalised to the prediction from the SM. The statistical analysis implemented in the RooFit package [22] uses a binned likelihood function \(L(\mu,\theta)\). The \(H_{T}\) distribution is used as the final discriminant in the six signal regions. The impact of systematic uncertainties on the background expectations is described by nuisance parameters \(\theta\).

As a result of the fit, the uncertainty on the best-fit value of \(\mu\) is found to be \(\pm 0.16\) corresponding to a 11% uncertainty on the measured \(t\bar{t}t\bar{t}\) cross-section. The corresponding significance is well above 5 standard deviations. A significance of around 5 standard deviations should be achievable with a luminosity of 300 fb\({}^{-1}\) assuming a center of mass energy of \(\sqrt{s}=14\) TeV.

The ranking obtained for the nuisance parameters ordered according to the largest contribution to the uncertainty in the signal strength is shown in Figure 6. The largest impacts come from the normalisation of the \(t\bar{t}t\bar{t}\) signal as well as on the \(t\bar{t}V\) background in the SR3l-6j3b and on the instrumental background in the SR2l-6j3b region. The shape uncertainties do not significantly affect the result. Measuring the \(t\bar{t}V\) and \(t\bar{t}H\) backgrounds differentially as a function of jet multiplicity would decrease the impact of these systematic uncertainties. Overall the impact of the systematic uncertainties is however modest as a fit without systematic uncertainties leads to a precision of 9% on the extracted \(t\bar{t}t\bar{t}\) cross-section.

Figure 6: Fitted values of the nuisance parameters corresponding to the systematic uncertainties and their impact on the measured signal strength \(\mu\). The fit is performed under the signal-plus-background hypothesis with the SM \(t\bar{t}t\bar{t}\) production as signal. The black points, which are plotted according to the bottom horizontal scale, show the deviation of each of the fitted nuisance parameters, \(\hat{\theta}\), in units of the pre-fit standard deviation \(\Delta\theta\). The black error bars show the post-fit errors in units of pre-fit standard deviation. The nuisance parameters are sorted according to the post-fit effect of each of them on \(\mu\) (solid dark and light blue areas, for positive and negative variations respectively), with those with the largest impact at the top. The pre-fit effect of each nuisance parameter is also shown (empty dark and light blue areas, for positive and negative variations respectively).

## 7 Conclusion

Projections for the measurement of the SM four-top-quark production cross-section in final states containing two same-charge leptons or at least three leptons, at least five jets and at least two \(b\)-jets at \(\sqrt{s}=14\) TeV were performed in the context of the High-Luminosity LHC with 3000 fb\({}^{-1}\) of proton-proton collisions with the ATLAS experiment. An uncertainty on the \(t\bar{t}t\) cross-section of 11% is expected with the precision being dominated by the statistical uncertainty. This corresponds to a significance to observe this yet-unmeasured signal well above 5 standard deviations. The current theoretical uncertainty on the computation of the four-top-quark production cross-section is roughly twice larger than the experimental projected uncertainty.
