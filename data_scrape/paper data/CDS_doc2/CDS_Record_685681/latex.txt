The energy resolution of jets in the ATLAS Hadron End-Cap Calorimeter is studied as

a function of characteristic parameters of the electronics chain. As characteristic parameters are assumed: gain variation of preamplifiers, nonlinearity of preamplifiers, accuracy

of the calibration system and accuracy of the timing system. The results of these studies

allow to determine appropriate values of the above mentioned parameters. The studies

are based on detailed Monte Carlo simulations.

Introduction

The design of the electronics for the ATLAS Hadron End-Cap Calorimeter demands information about appropriate values of characteristic parameters of this electronics. The word "appropriate" means that the performance of the hadron calorimeter corresponds to its design values. One of the main performance requirements is the energy resolution of jets. The goal of this work is to study the influence of characteristic parameters of the electronics, designed for the liquid argon (LAr) ATLAS Hadron End-Cap Calorimeter, on the jet energy resolution.

The studies are based on Monte Carlo simulations. A brief description of these simulations is given in Section 2 together with the description of the procedure to determine the energy resolution of jets. Section 3 contains information about the characteristic parameters of the electronics, on which the present studies are based. Results and conclusions are presented in Section 4.

## 2 Simulation Procedure

Simulations are based on the standard software of ATLAS -- DICE/SLUG. A more detailed description of the simulation procedure can be found in Ref. [1].

Single d-quark jets are generated with the PYTHIA 5.7 program [2] for a pseudorapidity value of \(\eta=2.45\) at six different energy points between 40 and 2000 GeV. For each energy point 1000 jets are generated. The detector response to the final state particles of those jets is simulated using the program GEANT 3.21 [3] with the FLUKA code for shower development.

The reconstructed energy in the end-cap calorimeter depends on two calibration constants: one for the electromagnetic (_em_) and one for the hadronic calorimeter. These constants are calculated using a standard procedure, which minimizes the energy resolution with respect to the generated jet energy. The jet energy is determined by summing the reconstructed energies of all cells within a circle of radius 0.7 in the \((\eta,\varphi)\)-plane around the jet axis. A value of 0.7 for the radius is appropriate for jet spectroscopy under LHC conditions.

Since the energy resolution of jets at low energies is affected by the material in front of the end-cap calorimeter, the energy dependence of the resolution can be fitted (see Ref. [1]) by a three parameter function:

\[\frac{\sigma}{E}=(\frac{A}{\sqrt{E_{JBT}}}+B)\oplus\frac{C}{E_{JBT}} \tag{1}\]

with a sampling term \(A\), a constant term \(B\) and a material term \(C\). The energy dependence of the resolution as well as the results of its fit using the formula 1 are shown in Fig. 1. Thus in the ideal case (neglecting any influence of characteristic parameters of the electronics) the jet energy resolution is found to be:

\[\begin{array}{l}A=39\pm 5\%\sqrt{GeV},\\ B=0.9\pm 0.1\ \%,\\ C=5.3\pm 0.3\ GeV.\end{array} \tag{2}\]

## 3 Characteristic Parameters of the Electronics

Mechanically the hadron end-cap calorimeter of ATLAS is a set of copper plates, oriented at 90\({}^{\circ}\) with respect to the beam direction. The active medium of the calorimeter consists of 56 gaps of LAr of 8 mm thickness each. The transverse granularity of the calorimeter in \(\eta\times\varphi\) is 0.1\(\times\)0.1.

Longitudinally the cells of LAr are combined into four compartments in ratios of 8:16:16:16. From the point of view of electronics a readout cell corresponds to a cell of LAr, a readout channel -- to a longitudinal compartment. The preamplifiers are connected with individual cells. The signals from a corresponding number of preamplifiers (8 or 16) are summed up by a "summing and shaping amplifier" to form a signal in a readout channel.

The preamplifiers of one readout channel may have different gains and a nonlinear characteristics in addition. On the level of a readout channel the information about the contribution from an individual preamplifier is already lost. Therefore it is impossible (in a standard calibration scheme) to make corrections for gain variation and nonlinearity for each preamplifier using the signals of the corresponding readout channel. This results in a degradation of the resolution of the calorimeter.

Another factor, which causes a degradation of the resolution, is a gitter in the timing system. Due to such a gitter the signal of a readout channel is not measured in the position of the maximum of the shaping function, but in its neighbourhood. This leads effectively to a decrease of the signal.

The accuracy of the calibration system of the readout channels has also been considered as a factor of influence on the resolution.

### Simulation of Characteristic Parameters of the Electronics

These characteristic parameters of the electronics mentioned above are taken into account in simulations in the following way:

**Gain variation of preamplifiers.** The energy \(E_{i}\), deposited in a readout cell \(i\), is multiplied by a factor \(\alpha_{i}\). The values \(\alpha_{i}\) are generated for each cell \(i\) according to a normal distribution with a mean value \(<\alpha>\) = 1 and a standard deviation \(\sigma_{G}\). The value \(\sigma_{G}\) characterizes the level of the inequality of the gain of preamplifiers.

**Nonlinearity of preamplifiers.** Instead of the deposited energy \(E_{i}\), a value of a nonlinear function \(f(E_{i})\) is taken. An example of such a function is shown in Fig. 2. The analytical form of the function, which is used in this analysis, is the following

\[f(E)=\left\{\begin{array}{ll}E+4\gamma_{L}/E_{max}(E-E_{max}/2)^{2}-\gamma_{ L}E_{max}&\mbox{if }E<E_{max}/2\\ E-4\gamma_{H}/E_{max}(E-E_{max}/2)^{2}-\gamma_{L}E_{max}&\mbox{otherwise}\end{array}\right.\]

The values \(\gamma_{H}\) and \(\gamma_{L}\) characterize the level of the nonlinearity of the preamplifiers for high and low signals respectively. The difference between linear and nonlinear functions is \(\gamma_{H}E_{max}\) (\(\gamma_{L}E_{max}\) ), for a signal of \(E_{max}\) (0) resp. (see Fig. 2). The value \(E_{max}\) of the maximal possible signal in a readout cell is assumed to correspond to an energy of 15 GeV1. In the case \(\gamma_{H}\rightarrow\)0 and \(\gamma_{L}\rightarrow\)0, the function \(f(E)\to E\).

Footnote 1: Studies of the largest signals in a hadron end-cap calorimeter showed that 99% of events with 5000 GeV jets had a maximum signal in a readout cell corresponding to not more than 14 GeV deposited energy.

**Accuracy of timing.** According to the results of the studies presented in Ref. [4], shaping amplifiers with different values of the peaking time of a signal from a delta pulse \(t_{p}(\delta)\) (namely 20, 30, 40 and 50 ns) are planned to be used for the hadron end-cap calorimeter. In Fig. 3 shaping functions \(f_{sh}(t)\) as output signals for a triangle ("real") pulse are presented for different values of \(t_{p}(\delta)\). The gitter in timing should be most critical for the first function with the shortest peaking time. Therefore, in the present studies, this function is applied to all readout channels. The position of the maximum of the selected function is at \(t_{p}\)=48.75 ns. To simulate a gitter in timing, a value \(t\) is generated according to a normal distribution with a mean value \(<t_{p}>=\)48.75 ns and a standard deviation \(\sigma_{t}\). Then the signal of a readout channel is multiplied by the value of the shaping function at the generated point \(f_{sh}(t)\) (\(f_{sh}(t_{p})=1\)). The parameter \(\sigma_{t}\) characterizes the accuracy of the timing system.

**Accuracy of calibration.** The signal of a readout channel is multiplied by a factor \(\beta\) to simulate the accuracy of the readout channel, derived from the calibration system. The factors \(\beta\) are generated for each readout channel according to a normal distribution with a mean value \(<\beta>\) = 1 and a standard deviations \(\sigma_{C}\). The value \(\sigma_{C}\) characterizes the accuracy of the calibration of a readout channel.

### Correction Procedure

In the ideal case the energy in a readout channel is given by:

\[E_{ideal}=\sum_{i=1}^{N}E_{i},\]

where \(E_{i}\) is the energy deposited in the \(i^{th}\) readout cell of this readout channel, \(N\) represents the number of readout cells of a readout channel (8 or 16). Taking into account the characteristic parameters of the electronics (described above), the energy measured in a readout channel can be written as

\[E_{meas}=\beta f_{sh}(t)\sum_{i=1}^{N}\alpha_{i}f(E_{i}). \tag{3}\]

As it was shown in Ref. [5], the energy measured in a readout channel has to be corrected taking into account the known values of the gains of the preamplifiers belonging to this channel.

Consider first the case of linear preamplifiers. The measured energy is then

\[E_{meas}=\beta f_{sh}(t)\sum_{i=1}^{N}\alpha_{i}E_{i}.\]

The correction is based on the assumptions, that the energy depositions in the readout cells of one readout channel do not differ much and that the accuracies of timing and of calibration are not too bad. Then the last equation can be rewritten:

\[E_{meas}=\mathcal{E}\sum_{i=1}^{N}\alpha_{i},\]

where \(\mathcal{E}\) is approximately a mean value of the energy, deposited in a cell. Then the corrected energy in a readout channel can be written as

\[E_{corr}=N\mathcal{E}. \tag{4}\]

From the last two equations the corrected energy in a readout channel in the case of linear preamplifiers can be estimated as

\[E_{corr}=E_{meas}\frac{N}{\sum_{i=1}^{N}\alpha_{i}}. \tag{5}\]

In the case of nonlinear preamplifiers under the above assumptions, equation 3 can be rewritten

\[E_{meas}=f(\mathcal{E})\sum_{i=1}^{N}\alpha_{i}.\]The variable \(\cal E\) can be found by solving this equation. Depending on the function \(f(E)\) there might be several solutions.

The solution, which approaches the estimate of formula 5 in the limit of a linear case (when the parameter of nonlinearity tends to zero) is selected. Then the chosen solution should be inserted into formula 4 to obtain the corrected energy in a readout channel.

## 4 Results

To obtain information about the dependences of the jet energy resolution on the five characteristic parameters of the electronics of the hadron end-cap calorimeter (gain inequality of preamlifiers \(\sigma_{G}\), their nonlinearity for high signals \(\gamma_{H}\) and for low signals \(\gamma_{L}\), accuracy of the calibration system \(\sigma_{C}\) and gitter in timing \(\sigma_{t}\)), the procedure to calculate the resolution, described in Section 2, is modified in the following way. The energies, converted into signals in readout cells an readout channels, are modified according to the selected values of the characteristic parameters. Then the corrections are applied, if necessary. After that the corresponding energies are summed up to obtain the energy of a jet. It should be stressed that the energy, deposited in the _em_ end-cap calorimeter, is taken without any modifications. For these studies this calorimeter is considered as an ideal device.

The energy dependences of the resolution, obtained for different sets of characteristic parameters, are fitted by the function 1. It turned out, that the sampling and material terms do not depend on these characteristic parameters within error bars. Therefore in the further analysis the constant term \(B\) is used as the criterium of the degradation of the energy resolution of jets. The sampling and material terms are fixed at values, obtained for the ideal case (see 2). To be sure that such a procedure does not lead to errors, the dependences of the \(\chi^{2}\) values of the corresponding fits are carefully checked.

In Fig. 4 the constant term \(B\) and the \(\chi^{2}\) dependences are shown for those cases, when one of the characteristic parameters is varied and the four others are set to zero. In the plots with the dependences of the constant term \(B\) the lower dashed line corresponds to the value of the sampling term, obtained for the ideal case. The higher dashed lines mark the level of a sampling term, which is larger than the ideal one by 0.5 % (1.0 %) resp. (added quadratically). The influence of the nonlinearity of the preamlifiers in the range of high signals is negligible, since only events with 2000 GeV jets (and larger) are affected somehow by this kind of nonlinearity. The dependences of the constant term on the gain inequality of the preamplifiers and on their nonlinearity for low signals are also rather weak. Their contributions are always below 0.5 % for all studied values of these parameters. The accuracy of the calibration system and the accuracy of the timing system can influence the energy resolution of jets more seriously.

To estimate the influence of the characteristic parameters in a realistic case four parameters are set to values, which are considered to be reasonable and can be achieved even now from the point of view of their design: \(\sigma_{G}\)=0.05, \(\gamma_{H}\)=0.03, \(\gamma_{L}\)=0.03, \(\sigma_{C}\)=0.01. The parameter of the timing gitter \(\sigma_{t}\) is varied from 0 to 5 ns. The corresponding dependence of the constant term on this parameter for such a realistic case is shown in Fig. 5. The behaviour of this dependence shows, that a good energy resolution of jets can be achieved without imposing serious requirements on the characteristic parameters of an electronics chain of the ATLAS hadron end-cap calorimeter. An appropriate range of the characteristic parameters of the electronics is the following:

\(\bullet\) gain variation of preamplifiers -- up to 5 %,

\(\bullet\) nonlinearity of preamlifiers in high signal range -- up to 3 %,\(\bullet\) nonlinearity of preamlifiers in low signal range -- up to 3 %,

\(\bullet\) accuracy of a calibration system -- up to 1 %,

\(\bullet\) accuracy of timing -- up to 2 ns.
