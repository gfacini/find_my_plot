## Abstract

**This note documents the work done to study the \(\tau\)-jets separation in ATLAS using the large event samples full simulated in the DC1 context. The results obtained complete and improve the results shown in the ATLAS Detector and Physics Performance Technical Design Report (TDR).**

**The criteria used to separate \(\tau\)s from jets are based on information both from the calorimeters and from the Inner detector. The \(\tau\)-identification and the corresponding jet-rejection depend on the jet \(\rm E_{T}\), on the \(\eta\) position, on the jet-type and also on the event type.**

**Significant quantities to distinguish between \(\tau\)s and jets were studied and the separation cuts were optimised to give the best \(\tau\)-identification/jet rejection ratio. A Likelihood function was also built starting from those significant quantities and again the best cut on that was studied. The cuts were tuned both for events without and with electronic noise added in calorimeter cells.**

**A parametrisation of the jet-rejection vs the \(\tau\)-identification, based on the studies done in full simulation was prepared for the fast simulation program in ATLAS (ATLFAST), trying to take into account the dependence on the quantities listed above.**

**Events without piled up energy have been used throughout the text.**

Introduction

Excellent reconstruction and identification of all lepton species is crucial at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). \(\tau\)-leptons are the most difficult ones in this respect, since they produce neutrinos and hadrons among their decay products. Many different physics channels contain \(\tau\)-leptons in their final states. In particular the heaviest Higgs bosons in the Minimal Super Symmetric Model (MSSM) can be observed through their decays to \(\tau\)-leptons (\(bbA^{0}/H^{0}\to\tau\tau\), \(H^{\pm}\to\tau^{\pm}+\nu_{\tau}\) ) and the Standard Model (SM) Higgs produced through Vector Boson Fusion (VBF) can be observed when it decays to a \(\tau\)-pair. \(\tau\)-leptons can also be an important signature for SUSY. Since it will not be possible to discriminate between prompt light leptons (electrons and muons) and leptons from the \(\tau\)-decays, the hadronic decay modes will have to be explored. Various characteristics of a \(\tau\)-decay allow a discrimination against jets from QCD-events (QCD-jets) or heavy quark-jets (as from \(t\bar{t}\)). This discrimination will be called \(\tau\)-identification (\(\tau\)-Id) in the following.

It should be noted that \(\tau\)-leptons observed in those different channels have different \(p_{T}\) and \(\eta\) spectra and that also the backgrounds are different. Therefore the study of \(\tau\)-Id and jet rejection must cover a big kinematic region and also the \(\tau\)-efficiency required for a specific channel can be different.

### MSSM Higgs decaying to \(\tau\)s

It has been shown [4], [5] that a good \(\tau\)_-Id performance_ is crucial for the detection of \(bbA^{0}/H^{0}\to\tau\tau\) for the channels where at least one \(\tau\)-decays hadronically to suppress the huge reducible jet background from various sources. In particular in the case when both \(\tau\)s decay hadronically, an excellent \(\tau\)-Id/jet-rejection ratio is mandatory to reduce the overwhelming QCD background.

The observation of a charged Higgs boson would be a clear sign of new physics beyond the SM. In the MSSM the charged Higgs could be copiously produced in the decays of the top quark, if kinematically allowed. The channel \(pp\to t\bar{t}\to H^{\pm}bW^{\pm}\bar{b}\) with \(H^{\pm}\to\tau^{\pm}+\nu_{\tau}\) leads to an improvement in the expected sensitivity of the ATLAS detector to the discovery of the MSSM Higgs bosons. In particular for charged Higgs, masses below the top mass and in the intermediate tan\(\beta\) region signal significances above \(5\sigma\) can be reached studying the channel where the \(\tau\) decays hadronically. Furthermore the mass of the charged Higgs boson can be determined from the transverse mass distribution with a precision of about \(4\%\)[6]. So again a very good \(\tau\)-jet reconstruction and identification is needed. Fig. 1 shows the contribution of channels involving \(\tau\)s to the discovery potential in the MSSM parameter space. It gives a strong motivation to check the expected \(\tau\)-Id performance using high statistics of fully simulated data as available from the DC1 production.

### Vector Boson Fusion Higgs

The potential for the discovery of a Standard Model Higgs boson in the mass range \(m_{H}<2m_{Z}\) in the vector boson fusion mode has been studied for the ATLAS experiment at the LHC [7]. The characteristic signatures of additional jets in the forward regions of the detector and of low jet activity in the central region allow for an efficient background rejection. In ATLAS a large discovery potential in the \(H\to WW^{(*)}\) decay channel is expected and also the sensitivity to Higgs boson decays into \(\tau\)pairs in the low mass region around \(120\)GeV/c\({}^{2}\) is expected to be good. The latter channel is particularly interesting for a measurement of the Higgs boson coupling to fermions in the low mass region (\(<140\) GeV), since beyond the \(b\overline{b}\) decay mode no other direct Figure 1: Discovery potential for MSSM Higgs Bosons in the tan\(\beta\) vs. \(m_{A}\) plane for the maximal mixing scenario (**official ATLAS Higgs-Group figure, taken as a motivation for \(\tau\)-Id**). It can be seen that the channels involving \(\tau\)s cover a large part of the parameter space. The results shown here were obtained for the TDR using ATLFAST and a limited statistics of fully simulated events for \(bbA^{0}/H^{0}\rightarrow\tau\tau\) and its backgrounds.

fermion decay mode is accessible at the LHC. In particular a good signal significance can be obtained in the lepton-lepton final decay channel and in the lepton-hadron-decay channel, if a good \(\tau\)-identification is reachable.

### SUper SYmmetry

In the search for Supersymmetry (SUSY) with the ATLAS-Detector at the LHC hadronic \(\tau\)-decays can play an important role. Their use is vital to obtain information about the third generation sparticles which differ from the first two generations in their enhanced Yukawa couplings. This leads, for tan\(\beta\gg 1\), to a large mixing between the SUSY partners of the left and right handed sfermions (\(l_{R}\) and \(l_{L}\)). This mixing splits the mass eigenstates of the \(\tilde{\tau}\)'s (\(\tilde{\tau}_{1}\) and \(\tilde{\tau}_{2}\)) and also gives a non-trivial polarisation of the produced \(\tau\)s. Thus the physics of the \(\tilde{\tau}\)s is quite different from that of the first two generations.

For a large region in SUSY parameter space, with high tan\(\beta\), \(\tau\)s are abundantly produced in the decay chains of sparticles, like in

\[\tilde{\chi}_{2}^{0} \rightarrow \tau\ \tilde{\tau}\rightarrow\tau\ \tau\tilde{\chi}_{1}^{0}\] (1) or \[\tilde{\chi}_{2}^{\pm} \rightarrow \nu_{\tau}\ \tilde{\tau}^{\pm}\rightarrow\nu_{\tau}\ \tau^{\pm}\tilde{\chi}_{1}^{0}\qquad. \tag{2}\]

As already said, a good \(\tau\)-Id performance of the detector is not only important to SUSY searches in sparticle decay chains but also in the Higgs sector in channels like \(A^{0}/H^{0}\longrightarrow\tau\tau\) and \(t\longrightarrow H^{+}b\longrightarrow\tau\nu b\). If different hadronic decay modes of the \(\tau\)s can be separated their polarisation can be determined which in turn allows to obtain information on the chiral structure of the SUSY Lagrangian [8]

## 2 Simulated Data Samples

The \(\tau\)-Id is based on criteria, such as shower shape in the calorimeters, that can be evaluated realistically only by using a detailed GEANT-based simulation of the detector response. Therefore, high-statistics samples of fully-simulated events were used for this study. Large samples of events full simulated in the ATLAS Data Challenge 1 (DC1) [9] and also large samples of events specially full simulated for this study were reconstructed with no-noise and with noise in calorimeters. Table 1 shows the statistics of the fully simulated events used for this study.

### The ATLAS full simulation

The GEANT-based simulation package is composed of different steps. The first step is commonly referred to as generation. A variety of well known Monte-Carlo event generators may be used for this step. Here PYTHIA 6.206 [10], interfaced to the ATLAS framework ATHENA [11], was used for the generation. TAUOLA was not used to decay the \(\tau\)leptons. Instead PYTHIA as present in ATHENA 6.0.4 was used with ATLAS default settings. PYTHIA does not take into account a possible polarisation of \(\tau\)s and therefore can give wrong predictions on the energy spectrum of the visible decay products.

The second step is called simulation and is accomplished by GEANT 3, together with the ATLAS geometry description called ATLASIM. GEANT 3 produces hits in the active material of the ATLAS-detector which are subsequently digitised by ATLASIM. This steps can be considered as the simulation of the readout electronics.

The third step is called reconstruction. It is composed of various packages within ATHENA where each package is responsible for the reconstruction of certain objects. They are stackedfrom more detector based objects such as EM-clusters to more physics based objects like \(\tau\)s. The aim of this note is to provide criteria for the identification and separation from jets of these \(\tau\)-objects.

### \(\mathrm{Z^{0},A^{0}/H^{0}}\) ( 150, 300, 450, 600, 800 GeV)

The channels which serve for this study as a source of \(\tau\)s over the energy range under consideration are \(bbA^{0}/H^{0}\rightarrow\tau\tau\) and \(Z^{0}\rightarrow\tau\tau\). The generation includes an underlying event according to PYTHIA's multiple parton-interaction model. No pileup was added to the events. To cover the energy range with more uniform statistics we generated samples with \(A^{0}/H^{0}\)masses of 150, 300, 450, 600 and 800 GeV at values for \(\tan\beta\) of 10, 15, 20, 30 and 45. For events with \(bbA^{0}/H^{0}\rightarrow\tau\tau\) a parton level filter had been applied which selected events with following cuts on the visible decay product of the \(\tau\):

* \(\tau\)\(\rightarrow\) ll : \(\mathrm{E_{T,e}}\geq 13\ \mathrm{GeV},\mathrm{E_{T,\mu}}\geq 5\ \mathrm{GeV},|\eta_{\mathrm{e,\mu}}| \leq 2.5\)
* \(\tau\)\(\rightarrow\) ll : \(\mathrm{E_{T,e}}\geq 13\ \mathrm{GeV},\mathrm{E_{T,h}}\geq 12\ \mathrm{GeV},|\eta_{ \mathrm{e,\mu,h}}|\leq 2.5\)
* \(\tau\)\(\rightarrow\) hh : \(\mathrm{E_{T,h}}\geq 12\ \mathrm{GeV},\mathrm{E_{T,h}}\geq 12\ \mathrm{GeV},|\eta_{ \mathrm{h}}|\leq 2.5\)

The transverse energy and \(\eta\) distributions of the hadronic decay products of \(\tau\)s are shown in Figs. 2 and 3. The PYTHIA data cards used can be found in the appendix A.2. In the following, if not stated differently, true \(\tau\)s have been used together from all these events. Since performance values depend in general at least on \(\mathrm{E_{T}}\) and \(\eta\) this should be kept in mind.

The rather big difference in this distribution between \(bbA^{0}/H^{0}\to\tau\tau\) and \(Z^{0}\to\tau\tau\) (less central, mainly due to the fact that the A\({}^{0}\)-samples were filtered on parton level) leads to differences in \(\eta\) dependent variables whenever projections in \(\eta\) are used.

### QCD-dijet events( 35, 70, 140, 280, 420, 560, 700 GeV)

This study focuses on the rejection of jets coming from QCD dijet production. Later the differences are shown for other event types (\(t\bar{t}\)). Depending on the working point (hence the chosen efficiency) high rejection factors can be obtained. Therefore, a high statistics sample of QCD dijet events was needed, populating the phasespace in \(\rm E_{T}\) up to 600 GeV. The samples where generated requiring a minimal outgoing \(\rm E_{T}\) for hard process of 35, 70, 140, 280, 420, 560, 700. The PYTHIA datacards used can be found in the appendix. The transverse energy and \(\eta\) distributions of these jets are shown in Figs. 4 and 5. A peak around the hard cut-off can be observed, which is washed out by parton shower, jet fragmentation and detector effects.All samples beside the region around the cut-off value populate also the low \(E_{T}\) region. The region of up to 700 GeV is covered with appropriate statistics.

### \(t\bar{t}\)

\(t\bar{t}\) events are used later to assess the different performance values for light quark-, gluon- or b-jets. It provides also a high activity environment. From the perspective of physics analysis \(t\bar{t}\) is a potential background to many of the analysis before mentioned and therefore of interest in the context of \(\tau\)-Id.

## 3 Tau reconstruction

The reconstruction of \(\tau\)-candidates in ATHENA 6.0.4 is done by a package called "tauRec" [12]. For later versions of ATHENA an alternative package, aiming at low to medium \(\rm E_{T}\)\(\tau\)s, is available. It is called tau1P3P and extensively covered in [13] it will therefore not be studied in the following. TauRec uses clusters as \(\tau\)candidates. These are provided by a sliding window

cluster algorithm called "CaloSWClusterMaker". It runs on "CaloTowers". These CaloTowers are the sum of all calorimeter layers summed up on a grid of \(\Delta\eta\times\Delta\phi=0.1\times 2\pi/64\). It returns a cluster of \(5\times 5\) core CaloTowers and three "extra" CaloTowers on all sides, corresponding to \(\Delta\eta\times\Delta\phi\sim 1.1\times 1.1\). The energy of the cluster is calculated only on the core CaloTowers. It also gives all the cells used with the full granularity of the corresponding calorimeters, which are used to calculate the quantities described in the following. Only clusters with \(\rm E_{T}>15\) GeV are used. Unfortunately the implementation present in ATHENA 6.0.4 did not provide a splitting or merging of clusters. This can lead to multiple, overlapping clusters, which will then result in multiple \(\tau\)candidates.

In Fig. 6 the probability is shown for a true \(\tau\)-jet within \(|\eta|<2.5\) to be reconstructed as a cluster (=\(\tau\) candidate) as a function of \(\rm E_{T}\) where \(\rm E_{T}=\)\(\rm E_{T}\)(visible decay product), as always. A true \(\tau\)-jet is called reconstructed if a cluster is found with a barycenter within \(\rm\Delta R<0.3\) around the \(\tau\)-jet direction. Black shows the probability for all samples vs. \(\rm E_{T}\) and blue for \(Z^{0}\rightarrow\tau\tau\) which has a rather different \(\eta\) distribution and less general activity. Both samples show good agreement above the reconstruction threshold of 15 GeV. The efficiency rises from 20 % at 15 GeV over 88 % at 20 GeV and saturates at 98 % for \(\rm E_{T}>30GeV\). The difference when the true \(\rm E_{T}\) is below the reconstruction threshold of 15 GeV between \(Z^{0}\rightarrow\tau\tau\) and the high mass samples is due to a cut at generator level, which was applied to select only events with at least one visible \(\tau\)-jet 1. A cluster is called \(\tau\)-jet if a true \(\tau\)-jet was found with \(\rm\Delta R<0.3\).

Footnote 1: A visible \(\tau\)-jet was defined as being within \(|\eta|<2.5\) and to have a \(\rm E_{T}>12\) GeV

All cells within \(\rm\Delta R<0.4\) around the barycenter are then calibrated with an H1-style calibration. Cell-weights are functions of cell-energy and calorimeter region. They are optimised for the jet calibration and weights can be found in [14]. The \(\rm E_{T,reco}/\rm E_{T,true}\) is plotted in Fig. 7 vs. \(\rm E_{T}\) and in Fig. 8 vs. \(\eta\). As can be seen from Fig. 9, where the reconstructed \(\rm E_{T}\) over true \(\rm E_{T}\) is shown for all signal samples, the weights obtained are not optimal for \(\tau\)s. This is at least in parts expected since the hadronic and electromagnetic composition, depth and so on are different between \(\tau\)-jets and QCD-jets. Also the applied identification strategy has an impact on the calibration as can be seen in Fig. 9 where the resolution vs. \(\eta\) is also shown for selected \(\tau\)s. An effort is being made to improve that situation and results will be shown in [16].

## 4 Variables used in Tau identification

In Table 2 the relevant \(\tau\)-decay modes and branching ratios are given. A \(\tau\) decays with \(c\cdot\tau=87\)\(\mu\)m to one or three charged pions plus eventually neutral pions to nearly 100 %. The neutral pions decay immediately into two photons which eventually convert before the calorimeter. Hence \(\tau\)-jets are collimated low multiplicity jets with hadronic and electromagnetic energy depositions. The tracks have impact parameter \(>0\) and in the case of a three prong decay the reconstruction of a secondary vertex might be possible.

Several quantities which explore these properties have been constructed. They are described in detail in the following.

\(\bullet\)**EM-Radius**

To make use of the smaller transversal shower profile of \(\tau\)lepton, one makes use of the electromagnetic radius which is defined as follows:

\[R_{em}=\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n}E_{Ti}\sqrt{\left(\eta_{i}-\eta_{cluster}\right)^{ 2}+\left(\phi_{i}-\phi_{cluster}\right)^{2}}}{\sum_{i=1}^{n}E_{Ti}} \tag{3}\]i runs over all electromagnetic calorimeters cells in the cluster with \(\Delta\)R \(<0.4\),

n denotes their number, \(E_{Ti}\) is the transverse energy in cell i

Cells may have different sizes depending on the layer and on \(\eta\) and of the cluster. The size varies from \((\Delta\eta\times\Delta\phi)=0.003\times 0.1\) in the \(\eta\)-strip region of the EM-barrel to \(0.05\times 0.025\) for the third EM layer of the end-cap. This leads to a dependence of the performance on \(\eta\) which will be discussed later.

R\({}_{\rm em}\) distributions for \(\tau\)s and QCD-jets in different E\({}_{\rm T}\) bins are shown in Fig. 10. This variable shows good discrimination for low E\({}_{\rm T}\) which becomes less effective for higher E\({}_{\rm T}\). As expected its mean becomes smaller for both \(\tau\)s and jets with higher boost.

\(\bullet\)**Isolation in the calorimeter**

\(\tau\)-jets are well collimated, therefore a rather tight isolation criteria can be used. Here a ring \(0.1<\Delta\)R \(<0.2\) was chosen as isolation region.

\[\Delta{\rm E}_{\rm T}^{12}=\frac{\sum_{\rm j=1}^{n^{\prime}}{\rm E }_{\rm Tj}}{\sum_{\rm i=1}^{n}{\rm E}_{\rm Ti}} \tag{4}\]

j runs over all electromagnetic calorimeters cells in the cluster with \(0.1<\Delta\)R \(<0.2\),

n' denotes their number, E\({}_{\rm Tj}\) is the transverse energy in cell j

i runs over all electromagnetic calorimeters cells in the cluster with \(\Delta\)R \(<0.4\),

n denotes their number, E\({}_{\rm Tj}\) is the transverse energy in cell i

Figure 6: Reconstruction efficiency for \(\tau\)-jets as a function of E\({}_{\rm T}\). Black is an average over all signal samples, blue is only the \(Z^{0}\rightarrow\tau\tau\) sample.

Figure 7: The ratio between the reconstructed and the true \(\rm E_{T}\) of the had. \(\tau\)decay products is shown as a function of \(\rm E_{T}\). The abscissa value is the mean and the error bar indicates the RMS. Black shows all samples averaged and blue \(Z^{0}\rightarrow\tau\tau\) alone.

Figure 8: Reconstructed \(\rm E_{T}\) over true \(\rm E_{T}\) vs. \(\eta\) for four \(\rm E_{T}\) bins. Black are all samples before identification, green is \(Z^{0}\rightarrow\tau\tau\) only. For green and red a loose identification cut (LLH \(>\) 2, where LLH will be defined later) had been applied. All samples vs. \(Z^{0}\rightarrow\tau\tau\) only shows a relevant difference even when using \(\rm E_{T}\) bins. In addition the calibration depends on the identification used. The reconstructed energy becomes higher for identified \(\tau\)s. A difference is expected since the identification prefers collimated jets which show a different cell energy density distribution than unbiased jets. The effect is of the order of 3%.

Its distribution for \(\tau\)-jets and QCD jets is shown in Fig. 11. Like \(\rm R_{em}\) it shows a pronounced dependence on \(\rm E_{T}\) as expected since it is not Lorentz invariant. Therefore it becomes narrower with higher \(\rm E_{T}\) compared to the cell size and the discrimination becomes smaller for higher \(\rm E_{T}\). This variable will certainly also depend on the event type. In a more active environment such as, e.g., \(t\bar{t}\) it is expected to perform worse. Also the optimal ring dimensions will depend on the chosen samples.

\(\bullet\)**Number of associated tracks**

Hadronic \(\tau\)s decay into 1 (49.5%), 3 (15.2%) and very seldom 5 (0.1%) hadronic charged particle plus eventual \(\pi^{0}\). Normalised to hadronically decayed \(\tau\)s this translates into 1 (76.9%), 3 (23.1%) and 5 (0.2%). The number of associated tracks denotes the number of reconstructed2 tracks with \(\rm p_{T}>2\) GeV which are within \(\Delta R~{}<0.3\) from the cluster centre. These tracks have been selected applying quality selection criteria which are defined within the xKalman package of Athena. For the version of xKalman used for this note these were

Footnote 2: Tracks are reconstructed with the “xKalman” packages

* number of silicon clusters per track \(\geq\) 8
* clusters unique to this track \(\geq\) 5
* number of TRT clusters per track \(\geq\) 9
* number of holes \(\leq\) 22
* \(\chi^{2}\) for precision clusters \(\leq\) 15.0

Figure 9: Reconstructed \(\rm E_{T}\) over true \(\rm E_{T}\) is shown for all samples and \(Z^{0}\rightarrow\tau\tau\) before and after identification. The distribution is mainly Gaussian but underestimates the energy. This may result from the fact that the H1 weights where obtained using jet events and not \(\tau\)-decays. The weights should be refitted for use for \(\tau\) jets.

* ratio of TRTclusters to crossed straws \(\geq\) 0.7

From the decay modes and branching ratios one would naively expect that only one or three tracks should contribute to the observed \(\tau\)-jets. Nevertheless a significant fraction of zero, two and even four tracks are observed in the simulated data. Zero tracks are mainly observed because the track from a one prong decay had too little energy to pass the threshold of 2 GeV for the track. Another possibility is that the track was not reconstructed because of inefficiencies in the inner detector or not accepted by the above stated quality cut. Also very early hadronic interaction of the charged pion could lead to a number of widely spread out low \(p_{T}\) tracks which are consecutively not reconstructed.

Two sources contribute to the two-track case, one being three prong decays where one track is lost for similar reasons as discussed above. The second results from decay modes with neutral pions, where one photon has converted and one of the electron/positron pair is lost, or merged into the same track. The third possibility results from additional tracks which are picked up by chance. These may originate from the underlying event, multiple interactions, or other hard activity like ISR or FSR.

Usually, a preselection on the number of tracks is used before any additional cuts are applied. Figure 12 shows the distribution of the number of tracks for several \(\rm E_{T}\) bins. As expected the distributions show only a small \(\rm E_{T}\) dependence. This stems in part from the \(p_{T}\) threshold for tracks of 2 GeV. In addition, it is known that for cases with more than one track and high boost it becomes increasingly difficult to resolve the tracks, since they may share an increasing number of hits. Also cross sections for early hadronic interaction and photon conversion depend on energy.

In Tables 3 and 4 the number of associated tracks for all relevant decay modes is given in more detail. Both Tables show the number of tracks vs. the \(\tau\)-decay mode. In Table 3 (4) columns (rows) are normalised to 100%. Hence the first gives the number of associated tracks for a given decay mode and the latter gives the contribution of each mode to a given number of tracks.

Finally, Table 5 gives some overall numbers for efficiency and rejection of different cuts on \(\rm N_{Tr}\) which may be used as a preselection.

\(\bullet\)\(\tau\)**-Charge**

The charge is obtained as the sum of the charge of the associated tracks. At present, tracks are reconstructed by the xKalman algorithm. Figure 13 shows the charge distribution for \(\tau\)s and QCD-jets in \(\rm E_{T}\) bins. \(\tau\)-charge shows almost no \(\rm E_{T}\) dependence within statistical errors. It is highly correlated with "NTracks". The last \(\rm E_{T}\) bin shows high statistical uncertainties.

\(\bullet\)**Number of hits in the \(\eta\) strip layer**

The number of hits in the in \(\eta\)-direction finely segmentated strips in the first layer of the EM-barrel is also used as a criteria to separate against jets.

Cells in the \(\eta\) strip layer within \(\rm\Delta R\ <0.4\) around the cluster centre are counted as a hit if they contain more than 200 MeV.

The distributions for \(\tau\)-jets and QCD-jets in several \(\rm E_{T}\) bins are reported in Fig. 14. At low \(E_{T}\) a significant fraction of real \(\tau\)s deposit nearly no energy in the \(\eta\) strip layer, this is mainly due to the single pion decay mode. This is less frequent for jets with comparable \(E_{T}\).For high \(E_{T}\) jets tend to show more hits than \(\tau\)-jets.

\[\Delta\eta=\sqrt{\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n}E_{Ti}\left(\eta_{i}-\eta_{cluster}\right)^{2 }}{\sum_{i=1}^{n}E_{Ti}}} \tag{5}\]

The distributions are shown in Fig. 15. Here again can be observed that the width in the calorimeter is a powerful discriminator at low \(\rm E_{T}\), but loses with rising \(\rm E_{T}\), when QCD-jets become very collimated because of high boosts.

\(\bullet\)**Lifetime signed pseudo impact parameter significance**

At present only a 2-dimensional impact parameter, also called pseudo impact parameter, is used. It is defined as the smallest distance of a track to the beam axis, assumed to have x=y=0. This corresponds to "A0Vert" in the CBNT-ntuple3. From this, together with the jet axis, a quantity is constructed which is commonly denoted "lifetime signed impact parameter".

Figure 15: Transverse energy weighted width in the \(\eta\) strip layer, black for \(\tau\)-jets and red for QCD-jets, after the requiring N\({}_{\rm Tr}\) =1..3. All distributions are normalised to an area of one. For the definition see eq. (5).

Figure 16 illustrates the geometry involved.

It is defined as follows

\[\sigma_{IP}=d_{0}/\sigma_{d_{0}}*sign(sin(\varphi_{cl}-\varphi_{tr})) \tag{6}\]

\(d_{0}\) is the pseudo impact parameter, hence the impact parameter only in the x-y plane.

\(\sigma_{d_{0}}\) denotes the error, as defined in the track fitting, of the pseudo impact parameter.

\(\varphi_{cl}\) and \(\varphi_{tr}\) are the coordinates at the calorimeter for the cluster

and at the point of closest approach for the track.

The lifetime signed pseudo impact parameter is constructed in a way to have a positive sign if the the decay happened in flight direction. In Fig. 16 two cases are illustrated called Track1 and Track2. Track1 results from a particle which decays in flight direction and Track2 from a particle which decayed opposite to its flight direction. The sign of \(d_{0}\) is defined in the following way: let \(P_{c}\) be the point of closest approach, and \(g_{1}\) the tangent to the track at \(P_{c}\). \(P_{p}\) denotes the primary vertex. If the angle \(\angle(g_{1},\overline{P_{c}P_{p}})=90^{\circ}\), \(d_{0}\) is defined positive, if it is \(=270^{\circ}d_{0}\) is defined negative. Therefore Track1 has positive \(d_{0}\) and Track2 has negative \(d_{0}\). Since both show similar \(\varphi\) and therefore equal \(sign(sin(\phi_{cl}-\phi_{tr}))\), the resulting \(\sigma_{IP}\) is positive for Track1 and negative for Track2. If the jet axis would be opposite it is easy to see that the result would be reversed.

The corresponding distributions are given in Fig. 17.

A bias towards positive values is expected for tracks with true lifetime. Despite of the rather short lifetime of the \(\tau\) of \(c\cdot\tau=87\mu\) the expected bias can be clearly seen. The decay length is \(c\cdot\tau\cdot\gamma\), therefore it should increase with the boost. On the other hand the opening angle behaves as \(1/\gamma\) therefore compensating the larger decay length from higher boosts. The impact parameter resolution is expected to improve with p\({}_{\rm T}\). Overall a small increased bias for higher E\({}_{\rm T}\) is expected and can be observed in Fig. 17.

Figure 16: Lifetime signed pseudo impact parameter significance.It is constructed in a way to have a positive sign if the the decay happened in flight direction. Two cases are illustrated called Track1 and Track2. Track1 results from a particle which decayed in flight direction and Track2 from a particle which decayed opposite to its flight direction. The sign of \(d_{0}\) is defined in the following way: let \(P_{c}\) be the point of closest approach, and \(g_{1}\) the tangent to the track at \(P_{c}\). \(P_{p}\) shall denote the primary vertex. If \(\angle(g_{1},\overline{P_{c}P_{p}})=90^{\circ}\), \(d_{0}\) is defined positive, if \(270^{\circ}\) negative. Therefore Track1 has positive \(d_{0}\) and Track2 has negative \(d_{0}\). Since both show similar \(\varphi\) and therefore equal \(sign(sin(\varphi_{cl}-\varphi_{tr}))\), hence the resulting \(\sigma_{IP}\) is positive for Track1 and negative for Track2. If the jet axis would be opposite it is easy to see that the result would be reversed.

\(\bullet\)**E\({}_{\rm T}\) over p\({}_{\rm T}\) of the first track**

\(\tau\)-jets are expected to have in general a high fraction of their energy in the leading track. QCD-jets, on the other hand, are expected to have a more uniform distribution of p\({}_{\rm T}\). They are also expected to have more additional neutral particles. E\({}_{\rm T}\) over p\({}_{\rm T}\) aims to explore these features. Its distributions are given in Fig. 18 for \(\tau\)-jets and QCD-jets. It shows a clear peak around one for the \(\tau\)-jets as expected for the single pion decay mode. Candidates with a value below one are compatible with the calorimeter folded with the track resolution. Values above one are expected for decay modes involving additional neutral pions and also for three prong decay modes. The E\({}_{\rm T}\) dependence is rather modest for \(\tau\)-jets but more pronounced for QCD-jets. They tend to become more signal like with higher E\({}_{\rm T}\). Nevertheless, a good discrimination can be achieved for low to medium E\({}_{\rm T}\).

## 5 Noise

Up to the beginning of 2003, the liquid argon calorimeter simulation within the new ATLAS software was only possible without electronic noise. The amount of noise implemented afterwards into the simulation can be found in [17] and [18]. They have been obtained from test beam setups with electronics similar to the one that will be used in the ATLAS experiment. In the following, results without and with electronic noise are shown.

Variables that concern track properties are not changed by the introduction of noise (beside the very small effect that a \(\tau\)-candidate is or is not reconstructed because of the additional noise and a possible change of the cluster axis). The change for calorimeter variables is generally small, apart the R\({}_{\rm em}\) for \(\tau\)-jets at low E\({}_{\rm T}\). The consequences for the \(\tau\)-Id will be shown in the following.

Figure 19 compares R\({}_{\rm em}\) and \(\Delta E_{T}^{12}\) for \(\tau\)-jets and QCD-jets for two E\({}_{\rm T}\) regions with and without noise included. The upper two rows are for \(15<{\rm E_{T}}~{}<30\) and the lower two are for \(45<{\rm E_{T}}~{}<65\). Distributions are presented after a cut of E\({}_{\rm cell}>2\sigma_{\rm cellnoise}\) and a preselection of N\({}_{\rm T}\) = 1..3. Only R\({}_{\rm em}\) for the \(\tau\)-jets suffers a relevant shift to lower values from the noise after cuts. The QCD-jets suffer a much smaller change which is also reduced by the preselection (plot before preselection not shown since it is the loosest used preselection).

## 6 Different algorithms

In the following four different ways of separating \(\tau\)-jets from QCD-jets are presented. They are ordered in the number of variables used. The first two have already been shown elsewhere but now they have been applied to different samples. The so called TDR cuts also serve generally as a reference.

### TDR cuts

TDR cuts are named for their use in the ATLAS TDR [1]. The cuts used are extensively documented in [2]. For comparison to this widely used criteria its performance is included in the plots. One should be aware that since there were only fixed cuts in plots "Efficiency vs. Rejection" this criteria gives, unlike the other algorithms, only points instead of lines. The applied cuts are:

\[C1:{\rm N_{T}}~{}=1\qquad;\qquad{\rm C2:R_{em}}<0.07\qquad;\qquad{\rm C3:\Delta E _{T}^{12}}<0.1 \tag{7}\]Figure 18: E\({}_{\rm T}\) over p\({}_{\rm T}\) of the first track, black for \(\tau\)-jets and red for QCD-jets, for different E\({}_{\rm T}\) bins. Distributions are shown after requiring N\({}_{\rm Tr}\) =1..3, and are normalised to an area of one.

Figure 19: Distributions of \(\rm R_{em}\) and \(\Delta E_{T}^{12}\), with(red) and without(black) noise, for different bins of \(\rm E_{T}\). The distributions are shown for \(\tau\)-jets (left column) and for QCD-jets (right column).

In Figs. 20 and 21 the efficiency and rejection are given for these cuts vs. p\({}_{\rm T}\) and \(\eta\) of the jet.

The performance is given for all samples together and for \(Z^{0}\rightarrow\tau\tau\) and dijet70 alone. The \(Z^{0}\rightarrow\tau\tau\) sample is somewhat special because of its rather flat \(\eta\) distribution and its general low activity. dijet70 was used because it constitutes a background to \(Z^{0}\rightarrow\tau\tau\). The first row in Fig. 20 shows the efficiency and rejection for cut C1 (N\({}_{\rm T}\ =1\)) only. It gives an efficiency between 50% and 60%, falling with E\({}_{\rm T}\). The rejection rises from 4 at 15-20 GeV to 1500 at 470-540 GeV. The efficiency is lower for \(Z^{0}\rightarrow\tau\tau\) by up to 7%. This is mainly caused by the less central \(\eta\) distribution as shown in Fig. 21.

The second row shows the efficiency and rejection for cuts C2 and C3 after cut C1. It gives a monotonous increase in efficiency with \(E_{T}\) from 10% at 15-20 GeV to 88% at 470-540 GeV. The rejection starts at a rather high value of 460 at 15-20 GeV, peaks at 30-45 GeV and drops than rapidly to low values of 3 at 470-540 GeV. \(Z^{0}\rightarrow\tau\tau\) shows a somewhat higher efficiency at 65-90 GeV. The rejection against dijet70 is comparable to the full sample.

The third row shows the efficiency and rejection for all three cuts combined and is therefore the product of values in row one and two. The efficiency rises from 7% and 15-20 GeV to 43% at 470-540 GeV. The rejection reflects the peak in the calorimeter variables at 30-45 GeV, falls to minimum at 65-90 GeV of 630 and rises than again up to 3000.

In Fig. 21 the content of rows and columns is the same as in Fig. 20. As expected the efficiency is highest for central \(\eta\) and drops for less central values. The calorimeter variables show a pronounced drop near the gap region. The rejection shows opposite tendencies for C1 and C2+C3, which results in a nearly flat rejection vs. \(\eta\).

\(Z^{0}\rightarrow\tau\tau\) shows a somewhat higher efficiency in the less central regions while the effect of the gap is more pronounced. The overall shift is due to the different \(E_{T}\) spectrum. The rejection against dijet70 is comparable to the full sample but suffers from very low statistics.

In Table 6 values for efficiency and rejection are given for the TDR cuts. They have been obtained using samples without noise. Table 7 reports efficiency and rejection values with noise included.

### Cuts on 6 variables ("6cuts")

To take the identification based on simple one-dimensional cuts a little further, and to separate the improvement coming from introducing E\({}_{\rm T}\) bins we carried out the optimisation of cuts on six variables for ten E\({}_{\rm T}\) bins. The variables used were R\({}_{\rm em}\), \(\Delta E_{T}^{12}\), N\({}_{\rm T}\), \(N_{\eta}\), \(\Delta_{\eta}\) and \(\tau-Charge\). The optimised cuts are reported in Tables 8 and 9.

Their performance as Efficiency vs. Rejection is given in Fig. 22 with and without calorimeter noise included. The method "6cuts" shows in general a better performance than the TDR cuts. Especially the drop observed at medium E\({}_{\rm T}\) is covered by the additional variables so that a monotonous increase in rejection at fixed efficiency is observed. A decrease in performance between 0 and 20% can be observed when adding calorimeter noise. The performance shows a monotonous increase with E\({}_{\rm T}\). Two example points are given with cut values in Tables 8 and 9.

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:33]

\(\rm E_{T}\) and high efficiency the performance is better with noise than without noise. This could be due the cut on cell energy applied in the noise case. This might indicate that such a cut could have improved the performance also without noise. This has not been pursued any further since the inclusion of noise is mandatory in the future.

### Likelihood "2004"

The likelihood "2004" is a one dimensional likelihood ratio based on 8 variables. It was constructed using QCD-jets and \(\tau\)-jets in 11 \(E_{T}\) bins, which are 15, 28, 44, 62, 88, 134, 218, 334, 434, 600, \(>\) 600 GeV. The variables are

* \(\rm N_{T}\)
* \(\rm N_{\eta-hits}\)

* \(\rm R_{em}\)

Figure 23: Efficiency for \(\tau\)s and rejection against QCD-jets vs. \(\eta\) for “LLH2003”, with(dashed) and without(full) noise. \(\rm E_{T}\) bins have been colour coded, not all are shown for clarity.

\(\Delta E_{T}^{12}\) * \(\Delta\eta\) * \(d_{0}/\sigma_{d_{0}}\) * \(\rm E_{T}\ /p_{T,1}\)

Five of the variables are continuous, three are discreet. For the discreet values, ratios are directly taken from histograms, for the continuous values fits of appropriate functions for each variable for all \(\rm E_{T}\) bins have been performed to the distributions. Examples of these fits are shown in Fig. 24. Although it is well known that there are important correlations between the different variables these are neglected by this approach, because the statistics available was not sufficient to make use of two dimensional PDFs. The distributions of the likelihood value for \(\tau\)-jets and QCD-jets is given in Fig. 25. Despite the mentioned drawbacks of using only one-dimensional distributions it shows a nice separation between \(\tau\)-jets and QCD-jets. Beside the PDFs also penalties of 20 are subtracted from the LLH value for every variable that is found outside the fitted histogram range. This leads to a rise for \(\tau\)-jets for low LLH values around -10.

Figure 26 shows the performance of this approach.

Despite the use of \(\rm E_{T}\) bins the LLH shows a residual \(\rm E_{T}\) dependence. Therefore a fixed cut on the LLH value will nor result in a generally flat efficiency, neither will it be optimal. Hence an \(\rm E_{T}\) dependant cut should be applied, which can be read of from Fig. 27.

A comparison between the LLH2004 and the TDR cuts is shown in Fig. 28. For the first row the LLH cut has been tuned to achieve the same efficiency vs. \(\rm E_{T}\) as the TDR cuts. Therefore the left plot is identical for LLH2004 and TDR. The right plot shows the rejection for both. A clear improvement resulting many times higher rejections can be seen for the LLH for \(\rm E_{T}<400\) GeV. Above 400 GeV the statistics also for the signal became very small, therefore the PDFs used in the LLH were expected to be effected by a larger statistical uncertainty there.

The second row shows the case for constant efficiency (only possible with the LLH because the cuts have not been optimised for each \(\rm E_{T}\) bin). Here as an example 50% has been chosen and the rejection is reported in the right plot.

For the third row the cut on the LLH has been tuned to give the same rejection vs. \(\rm E_{T}\) as the TDR cuts. It can be seen that the LLH gives much higher efficiency up to 400 GeV.

## 7 Jet-Types

It is expected that shape variables like \(\rm R_{em}\) and \(\Delta E_{T}^{12}\), but also \(\rm N_{Tr}\), will depend on the "jet type". Therefore rejections have been obtained for three different jet types separately. The jet types where "gluon jet", "quark jet" and "b-jet". Jets where classified according to the following algorithm.

For all reconstructed jets only MC particles have been considered within \(\rm\Delta R<0.4\). If there was a \(\tau\) or an isolated electron (coming from the decay of a Z, W, h) the jet was not used. If there was a b the jet was labelled as b jet if not only the quarks and gluons were sorted in \(\rm E_{T}\). The jet was then labelled according to the leading quark or gluon.

For Fig. 29 \(t\bar{t}\) events have been used. It shows the rejection coefficient vs. \(\rm E_{T}\) for the three considered jet types. A coefficient of 1.0 would indicate the average rejection found in the corresponding QCD dijet events.

The lowest curve is for quark initiated jets. It varies between a coefficient of 1/2 to 1/6 compared to the reference rejection. Hence quark jets are more similar to \(\tau\) jets than the QCDFigure 24: Fits which are used as PDFs for the LLH2004 to the five continuous variables. Black are distributions for \(\tau\)-jets and red for QCD-jets. The left column is for \(15.0\leq E_{T}\leq 28.5\) and the right column for \(43.5\leq E_{T}\leq 61.5\). Please note that the impact parameter (last row) had been multiplied by 1000.

Figure 25: LLH2004 distribution for \(\tau\)-jets (black) and QCD-jets (red). Candidates with a LLH \(<-10\) had variables outside the boundaries of histograms used when obtaining the PDFs. The LLH is applied after a preselection of \(1\leq N_{Tr}\leq 3\). Although, due to statistical limitations, only one-dimensional distributions have been used a good separation between \(\tau\)-jets and QCD-jets is achieved.

Figure 28: Efficiency for \(\tau\)s (left column) and rejection against QCD-jets (right column) vs. \(\rm E_{T}\) for “LLH2004”(black) and TDR-cuts(blue). Values for “LLH2004” have been obtained with noise included, values for TDR-cuts have been obtained without noise. For the first (last) row cuts on the LLH were defined to obtain the same efficiency (rejection) as the TDR cuts. For the second row cuts on the LLH were tuned to yield an efficiency of 50 %.

average. The next curve is for gluon initiated jets. These start at a coefficient of 1.5 and rise up to 3.5 at 50 GeV to fall than back to one. Therefore gluon jet are more easily rejected than quark jets and also than the QCD average. The third curve being for b-jets shows that these are even more easily rejected than the other two types. The coefficient rises up to a factor of 7.5 at 110 GeV. These results are important to be kept in mind when trying to understand the performance on different backgrounds, even though values shown here were obtained projected in \(\eta\)and might therefore change when enough statistics is available to bin in \(\eta\).

## 8 Parametrisation for ATLFAST

Several channels demand high rejections of \(\tau\)-jets vs. QCD-jets. Rejection factors of the order of 1000 are achievable, at least at high \(\rm E_{T}\). These high rejection factors on their hand forbid a full simulation of the QCD background for most physics analysis.

Despite of all the known limitations present in ATLFAST it can still be a viable tool to obtain an upper limit on the discovery potential of a given channel. To do so it must provide a particle identification that can be done using a parametrisation. These parametrisations will generally depend on \(\rm E_{T}\) and \(\eta\). They are obtained investigating a certain algorithm in full simulation and

Figure 29: Coefficient for rejection vs. \(\rm E_{T}\) is shown for different jet types separately. A one indicates a rejection like in the corresponding QCD dijet events. Quark jets(blue) show a coefficient of down to 1/6 at 60 GeV. Gluon jets(green) show a higher coefficient of up to 3.5 at 50 GeV. B jets are the easiest to reject showing a coefficient of up to 7.5 at 110 GeV. Values have been obtained in a projection in \(\eta\). Therefore a difference in the \(\eta\) distribution between the jet types can also lead to deviations.

deducing the rejection on a given and usually uncut sample. The (approximate) assumption is then made that rejection factors depend mainly on the kinematics of the object itself and only weakly on the environment.

The rejection against QCD-jets vs. the efficiency for \(\tau\)-jets has been parametrised based on results shown before and will be used to update the existing parametrisation in ATLFAST. The parametrisation currently implemented in ATLFAST4 is given in [2]. The straightforward approach would be to calculate the rejection for as many \(\rm E_{T}\) and \(\eta\) bins as possible, for various chosen efficiency and provide this information as a parametrisation.

Footnote 4: At least till Jan. 2006.

A strategy like this has several drawbacks. The background statistics are quite limited after a rejection of the order of 1000, therefore the number of \(\rm E_{T}\) and \(\eta\) bins would be very small. Even more so for low efficiencies where rejections are higher and therefore the numbers obtained are less precise. Given the probably low number of bins the interpolation or smoothing between bins becomes difficult.

Therefore a modified approach had to be adopted here.

* The background and signal has been divided in \(\rm E_{T}\) into 10 bins projected in \(\eta\).
* For these ten bins the efficiency vs. rejection curve has been obtained (see Fig. 30).
* An exponential function (\(f_{R\epsilon,j}\)) was fitted to these graphs. The exponential function describes the behaviour within errors. Later only one (high) efficiency will be used to obtain the rejection vs. \(\rm E_{T}\) and \(\eta\). These functions are needed to provide the possibility to choose the efficiency. The functions obtained are normalised to 1 at 55% efficiency.
* For a flat efficiency of 55% in \(\rm E_{T}\) and \(\eta\) the samples are divided into four \(\rm E_{T}\) bins (for bins see Fig. 31). Each of the four \(\rm E_{T}\) bins are divided into 7 \(\eta\) bins. The rejection is calculated for each of these bins.
* The obtained rejection vs. \(\eta\) is fitted with a forth order polynomial as shown in Fig. 31. The lower plot shows the fitted functions, with their area normalised to 1. One can see that the functions show a different dependence on \(\eta\) for different \(\rm E_{T}\) ranges. The differences are notably small, therefore the dependence of performance on \(\eta\) is only weakly correlated to the dependence on \(\rm E_{T}\) even though both are very important.
* The mean in \(|\eta|\) is calculated for the four \(\rm E_{T}\) ranges and the functions are normalised to one at the mean \(|\eta|\) value for later use. The functions obtained in this way are called \(f_{\eta,i},i=1..4\).
* Then the sample is divided into two \(\eta\) bins shown in Fig. 32. The rejection is than obtained in 10 \(\rm E_{T}\) bins. The values obtained are fitted with third order polynomial as shown in the same figure. The lower plot shows the normalised functions. The dependence on \(\eta\) is only weak and one obtains very similar functions for the two \(\eta\) ranges. Since they are very similar only a function (\(f_{\rm E_{T}}\) ) fitted to the full sample was used. Again one should note that the statistical errors are big and might change the picture significantly.
* A linear interpolation between the four functions \(f_{\eta,i}\) was chosen.
* Applying the parametrisation with the interpolation included changes the overall rejection somewhat. Therefore a factor, \(c_{in}\), has been introduced to correct for this effect.

Figure 30: Efficiency for \(\tau\)s vs. rejection against QCD-jets for different \(\rm E_{T}\) bins using “LLH2004”. Samples with noise included have been used. An exponential has been fitted to describe the dependence of rejection on efficiency. It should be noted that for high \(\rm E_{T}\) and low efficiency statistics fall to one and zero candidates after cuts. Hence the rejection vs. efficiency can only be assumed to be exponential even in this inaccessible range.

Figure 31: Rejection against QCD-jets vs. \(\eta\) for four different \(\rm E_{T}\) bins tuning “LLH2004” to yield an efficiency of 55 %. Eighth order polynomials have been fitted to describe the dependence of the rejection on \(\eta\). For the lower plot the functions have been normalised (in area) to one, to compare the shape for different \(\rm E_{T}\) bins. Values vs. \(\eta\) have been obtained vs. \(|\eta|\) and than mirrored to negative \(\eta\)-values.

Figure 32: Efficiency for \(\tau\)s vs. E\({}_{\rm T}\) for two different \(\eta\) bins tuning “LLH2004” to yield an efficiency of 55 %. Third order polynomials have been fitted to describe the dependence of the rejection on E\({}_{\rm T}\). For the lower plot the functions have been normalised (in area) to one, to compare the shape for different \(\eta\) bins.

Figure 33: Parametrisation of rejection against QCD-jets vs. E\({}_{\rm T}\) and \(\eta\) tuning “LLH2004” to yield an efficiency of 55 %, flat in E\({}_{\rm T}\) and \(\eta\).

Combining all steps described so far the following function was obtained as a parametrisation of the rejection for a flat efficiency of 55%:

\[R(E_{T},\eta,\epsilon)=c_{in}\cdot f_{E_{T}}\cdot f_{\eta,i}\cdot f_{R\epsilon,j} \tag{8}\]

where i is the bin number in \(\eta\) and j is the bin number in E\({}_{\rm T}\) when choosing an efficiency different from 55 %. A two dimensional plot of the obtained function is shown in Fig. 33 vs. E\({}_{\rm T}\) and \(\eta\) for an efficiency of 55%.

As a check in Fig. 34 a comparison between parametrisation and algorithm is shown, projected in E\({}_{\rm T}\) and \(\eta\). For this plot the parametrisation has been applied to the same samples as before and the number of remaining jets is shown. Since limited statistics had to be used some artificial feature may have been introduced in the curves. To circumvent that to some extend it was chosen not to model most of the rather local feature, instead a rather smooth rejection curve was chosen. This explains the difference in some bin groups, e.g. around 50 GeV for rejection vs. E\({}_{\rm T}\) where less jets are misidentified in FULLSIM than in the parametrisation.

### Transfer to ATLFAST

The results obtained above cannot be applied directly when dealing with the fast simulation ATLFAST. This is because these efficiencies and rejections had been normalised to tauRec candidates. ATLFAST is based on jets, hence the difference in reconstruction efficiency for tauRec candidates has to be translated to jets from ATLFAST.

The reconstruction efficiency for \(\tau\)-jets was already shown in Fig. 6. A similar plot for ATLFAST jets and ATLFAST labeled jets is shown in Fig. 35. For the left plot the probability is shown vs. E\({}_{\rm T}\) for a given true \(\tau\)-jet to have a reconstructed jet within \(\Delta\)R \(<\) 0.3. For the right plot this jet was additionally required to be of type 15. An ATLFAST jet is labelled as type 15 if there is a true \(\tau\)-jet within \(\Delta\)R \(<\) 0.3 and the ratio of E\({}_{\rm T}\) (true \(\tau\)-jet)/E\({}_{\rm T}\) (reconstructed jet) \(\geq\) 0.9. This requirement leads to the rather slow rise with E\({}_{\rm T}\) of the efficiency in ATLFAST labeling. The overlaid histogram from Fig. 6 shows that this rise is too slow compared to FULLSIM5. The difference for low ( \(\ll\) 15 GeV ) E\({}_{\rm T}\) is also due to different generator level cuts. The cuts described in chapter 2.2, present in the FULLSIM sample, were not applied for the ATLFAST samples. As for Fig. 6 only true \(\tau\)-jets from \(A^{0}/H^{0}\)decays entered the plot.

Footnote 5: Requiring the true \(\tau\)-jet to be responsible for a big part of the visible energy might be necessary to differentiate between isolated \(\tau\)-jets and \(\tau\)-jets within other jets.

ATLFAST used to calculate E\({}_{\rm T}\) (true \(\tau\)-jet) as E\({}_{\rm T}\) (\(\tau\))-E\({}_{\rm T}\) (\(\nu_{\tau}\))6. This is only correct if the \(\tau\)-jet and the \(\nu_{\tau}\) have the same direction. Since this is the case for most of our events the general picture, though, does not change significantly.

Footnote 6: At least up to Jan 2006.

Similar plots have been obtained for QCD-jets and are shown in Figs. 36 and 37 for tauRec candidates and ATLFAST jets.

The difference in the algorithms and the calibration of jets and \(\tau\)s leads to artifacts in the ratio of the order of 20 %, even after applying a tentative overall calibration factor. For E\({}_{\rm T}\)\(>\) 25 GeV a potential correction factor would be of the same order. So we decided not to include this correction and rather state it as an uncertainty in the parametrisation for \(\tau\)s and jets with E\({}_{\rm T}\)\(>\) 25 GeV. Below 25 GeV the differences are too striking to be corrected by a simple factor and therefore we recommend to not use the parametrisation below 25 GeV.

Nevertheless to do so one would also have to correct for the difference in reconstruction efficiency \(f_{\tau-rec}({\rm E_{T}})\) around 20 GeV obtained from Fig. 35, probably using ATLFAST and not ATLFAST B. Results obtained using ATLFAST B would be conservative since the Figure 34: Parametrisation of rejection and rejection after cuts on “LLH2004” against QCD-jets vs. \(\rm{E_{T}}\) and vs. \(\eta\) for an efficiency of 55 %, flat in \(\rm{E_{T}}\) and \(\eta\). Values vs. \(\eta\) have been obtained vs. \(|\eta|\) and than mirrored to negative \(\eta\)-values.

efficiency is generally underestimated (at least for \(\rm E_{T}>15\) GeV). Then the ratio N(ATLFAST jets)/N(tauRec candidates) could be applied, leading to much higher rejections. We would like to repeat that we think that \(\tau\)s at this energy are not under control and therefore recommend not to follow the procedure described here for \(\tau\)-jets below 25 GeV.

A possible approach could be to improve the detector description used in ATLFAST with e.g. a shower parametrisation as in [21]. Results using an early implementation of such an improved description have been presented in [22].

## 9 Conclusions

The identification of \(\tau\)-jets is crucial for the study of many different physics channels like the production of the heaviest Higgs bosons in MSSM and the production of a standard model Higgs through Vector Boson Fusion (VBF) decaying to \(\tau\)s or in SUSY channels.

In this note four different ways of separating \(\tau\)-jets from QCD-jets are presented, two (TDR and 6-cuts algorithms) are based on a series of cuts applied to quantities built both from the calorimeters and from the inner detector while the other two are based on a likelihood method. The so called TDR method, based on cuts on the basic three quantities \(\rm R_{em}\), \(\Delta E_{T}^{12}\) and \(\rm N_{Tr}\), is used as a reference. The \(\tau\)-Id based on the Likelihood "2004" algorithm gives a very good efficiency vs rejection against QCD jets, improving largely the simpler TDR \(\tau\)-Id.

It should be noted that the typical \(\tau\)-Id used to save enough signal events and to achieve the necessary rejection against background is different for different physics channels. In Fig. 28, where the performance of the Likelihood "2004" algorithm is shown, the typical \(\tau\)-Id ranges used for the different physics channels studies are also shown.

The addition of Noise in the calorimeter cells does not severely worsen the \(\tau\)-Id performance,

Figure 36: E\({}_{\rm T}\) distributions for jets in ATLFAST (black) and tauRec candidates in FULLSIM (red) in the upper row. The lower row shows the ratio between the two. To take into account the difference in calibration, the E\({}_{\rm T}\) of a \(\tau\)-jet in FULLSIM was multiplied with an overall factor to obtain a more similar calibration to ATLFAST (green). The left column is a zoom in E\({}_{\rm T}\).

if only cells with \(\mathrm{E_{cell}}>2\sigma_{\mathrm{cellnoise}}\) are used and the Likelihood has been reoptimised.

It is very important to notice that:

* \(\tau\)-Id and jet-rejection depend on \(\mathrm{E_{T}}\) and \(\eta\). The presented \(\tau\)-Id and jet-rejection shown e.g. in Fig. 28 depend therefore on the different composition of the total samples used here for signal and background.
* the jet-rejection is strongly dependent on the jet-type: the rejection against b-jets is the largest one, followed by the rejection against the gluon jets and finally by the rejection against the quark jets.
* \(\tau\)-Id and jet-rejection are dependent on the overall event activity, so on the event type
* finally, the \(\tau\)-Id and jet-rejection depend on the overall ATLAS layout. The results presented here are obtained with the layout used to simulate the data for the ATLAS Data Challenge 1, but they could be different for a different ATLAS layout.

For all the reasons listed above, it is very difficult to parametrise the jet-rejection vs \(\tau\)-Id ATLAS performance.

Nevertheless the attempt was made to improve the existing parametrisation, extending it also to higher energies. Some confidence in the new parametrisation was gathered for high \(\mathrm{E_{T}}\)\(\tau\)-jets and QCD-jets in the signal and backgrounds studied here. But if it holds on other signal and background samples has to be thoroughly studied with high statistics of fully simulated events for all given backgrounds.

A new note describing the \(\tau\)-Id performance using the Rome initial layout will be written soon.

### Technical problems and their consequences

The software and samples used showed some shortcomings which have only been resolved in later versions of the production or the software.

For reasons of size the truth information saved in the ntuple did not contain all generator particles. They were selected according to some common needs defined in file called "CBNT_Truth.txt". Unfortunately it did not include all decay products and their descendents of \(\tau\)s. Hence the \(\tau\)-decay could not be fully determined from the truth. One of the resulting shortcomings was that not all eventual neutrinos from e.g. decays of \(K_{L/S}\) could be attributed to the invisible decay part. Therefore the calibration plots assume as visible hadronic energy simply \(p_{\tau}-p_{\tau\nu,1}\). The quality of this approximation can be judged from Fig. 38. For this graph a separate, later production was used where the full decay was available. The correct visible \(\mathrm{E_{T}}\) over the approximated \(\mathrm{E_{T}}\) shows s bias of less than one per mill which can be safely neglected.

### Pythia Datacards

TAUOLA was not used for the reasons explained in 2.1. The underlying event settings are the ones used for DC17. Settings are generally taken to be modifications of DC1 agreed datacards (see also [20]).

Footnote 7: DC1: Data Challenge 1 was an collaboration wide effort to produce large statistics of GEANT 3 simulated events. These were all reconstructed using ATHENA.

For the \(bbA^{0}/H^{0}\rightarrow\tau\tau\) process the following datacards where used. The masses were 150, 300, 450, 600 and 800 GeV, \(\mathrm{tan}(\beta)\) 10, 15, 20, 30 and 45.
