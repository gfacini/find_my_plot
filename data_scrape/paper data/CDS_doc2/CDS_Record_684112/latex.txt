Introduction

After the detection of the Higgs boson, accurate measurements of the parameters of the Higgs boson will be necessary. Some work has already been done to explore the ATLAS potential for precision measurements concerning mass, rates, couplings, width and spin [1], [2]. In this study the work is continued, new channels are included and new methods are used.

The important channels for the mass measurement are \(\mathrm{H}\to\mathrm{Z}\mathrm{Z}\to 4\mathrm{l}\) and \(\mathrm{H}\to\gamma\gamma\). In the latter case the real background shape is now used in the mass determination. For the \(\mathrm{H}\to\mathrm{W}\mathrm{W}^{(*)}\to 1\nu\nu\) and \(\mathrm{W}\mathrm{H}\to\mathrm{W}\mathrm{W}\mathrm{W}\to 1\nu 1\nu\) channels, which have not been taken into account so far, a detailed mass reconstruction is performed.

Using the signal and background rates in the various channels the cross sections times branching ratios can be measured. Hence the ratio of the coupling to fermions and bosons can be explored. In the mass range below 200 GeV a direct measurement of the total width is not possible because the intrinsic width of the Higgs boson is much smaller than the expected detector resolution. It is however possible to measure the total width indirectly provided that the vector boson fusion can be identified [3].

To determine the spin of the Higgs boson, the decay correlation function [4], [5] is used. The suitable channel is \(\mathrm{H}\to\mathrm{Z}\mathrm{Z}\to 4\mathrm{l}\) and a mass range between 120 and 400 GeV can be covered. Above 400 GeV the sensitivity of the decay correlation function is strongly reduced.

## 2 Measurement of the Higgs boson mass

In most channels the Higgs boson appears as a resonant peak above the background (\(\mathrm{H}\to\gamma\gamma\), \(\mathrm{H}\to\mathrm{Z}\mathrm{Z}\to 4\mathrm{l}\)), thus the background can be subtracted using control regions outside the resonance. The error on the mass reconstruction includes the statistical error due to the limited number of signal events and the error of the subtraction of the background. The uncertainty on the absolute energy scale introduces a systematic error, which is assumed to be 0.1% for photons and leptons and 1% for each jet. This is a conservative estimation, since the ATLAS goal is to determine the absolute energy scale for photons and leptons with a precision of 0.02%.

In the \(\mathrm{H}\to\mathrm{W}\mathrm{W}^{(*)}\to 1\nu 1\nu\) and \(\mathrm{W}\mathrm{H}\to\mathrm{W}\mathrm{W}\mathrm{W}\to 1\nu 1\nu 1\nu\) channels, there is no possibility of subtracting the background, since signal and background distributions are similar and there is no mass peak due to the neutrinos in the final state. Hence others methods must be used (see chapter 2.3).

### The channel H\(\rightarrow\gamma\gamma\)

In the \(\rm{H\rightarrow\gamma\gamma}\) channel the Higgs signal appears as a small resonance above a large background. In the absence of the background the error of the mass reconstruction is given by \(\sigma/\sqrt{\rm{N}}\), which can also be used as a good approximation if the background is small. But in the presence of a large background an additional statistical error arises from the influence of this background events. According to Ref. [6] the the assumptions made so far are that the background is flat and that the error \(\rm{\Delta M_{H}}\) is given by

\[\rm{\Delta M_{H}}\ =\ \frac{\Gamma}{\sqrt{S}}\left[\frac{\int_{-n}^{n}x^{2}\,e^{ -x^{2}/2}dx}{\int_{-n}^{n}e^{-x^{2}/2}dx}+\frac{n^{2}B}{3S}\right]\, \tag{1}\]

where \(\Gamma\) is the signal peak width, \(S\) and \(B\) are the signal and background events and the considered region of the peak is between \(\rm{M_{H}-n\Gamma}\) and \(\rm{M_{H}+n\Gamma}\).

The mass resolution in the \(\rm{H\rightarrow\gamma\gamma}\) channel has already been studied using a full detector simulation in the TDR [1]. For the \(\rm{H\rightarrow\gamma\gamma}\) channel this assumption of a flat background is not well justified as can be seen in Fig. 2 where the background shape from the dominant QCD jet and \(\gamma\gamma\)-background as predicted by PYTHIA [7] after all cuts is shown.

In the present analysis a Monte Carlo simulation of signal and background distributions is performed to estimate the uncertainties on the mass reconstruction. Two different scenarios are considered, first a flat background distribution is assumed to get a comparison with the existing analysis, in the second case the real shape of the background is taken into account. The signal rate is varied between 100 and 3000 whereas the number of background events is in the range between 500 and 100000. To get numbers for the mass resolution a fit to the signal plus background shape was performed whereby the background shape was fixed by the Montre Carlo. The uncertainty on the Higgs mass determination is shown in Fig. 2 for \(\rm N_{S}=3000\) and varying background. Results are shown for both, assuming a flat background as well as for the true background shape. The result of (1) is also plotted.

Comparing the two scenarios, the resolution deteriorates in the order of 10% for background rates around 1000 and approximatly 30-50% for higher background rates (40000-50000) using the real background instead of a flat one. For \(\rm M_{H}\)=110 GeV and an assumed integrated luminosity of \(\int{\cal L}\,dt~{}=~{}100~{}\rm fb^{-1}\), the relative precision of the mass measurement is \(\rm\Delta M_{H}/M_{H}\)=0.47%. Due to the better signal to background ratio a precision of 0.32% can be obtained around \(\rm M_{H}\)=130 GeV. For three years of running at high luminosity a relative precision of 0.18 to 0.26% can be achieved over the mass range of 110 to 150 GeV. The results for an integrated luminosity of \(\int{\cal L}\,dt~{}=~{}100~{}\rm fb^{-1}\) as well as for 300 fb\({}^{-1}\) are summarized in Table 1.

### The channel \(\rm H\to ZZ\to 4l\)

The channel \(\rm H\to ZZ\to 4l\) provides the best possibility for a precise mass reconstruction, since the signature is clear and backgrounds are low. Over the mass range from 120 to 400 GeV a fractional error on the measured Higgs mass of 0.1% can be achieved assuming an integrated luminosity of \(\int{\cal L}\,dt~{}=~{}300~{}\rm fb^{-1}\). Above 400 GeV the Higgs width becomes large and the statistical error increases due to the decrease of the signal cross section. In addition the systematic error in this mass region may dominate due to the interference of signal and background. Nevertheless, the statistical accuracy of

is computed. The differences \(\Delta(\ln({\cal L}))=-\ln({\cal L})+\ln({\cal L}_{\it sel})\), where \({\cal L}_{\it sel}\) is the Likelihood function of the selected Higgs mass \({\rm M_{H}}^{\it sel}\), are used to get the reconstructed mass. Around the minimum of \(\Delta{\cal L}\), which should be at the selected Higgs mass, a parabolic fit is performed. The minimum of this parabola determines the reconstructed mass (see Fig. 3). This procedure is repeated many times so that one gets a distribution of the reconstructed masses. If this distribution is Gaussian the mean value and standard deviation gives the Higgs mass and the error on it.

The probability density functions of the signal show a distinctive dependence on the Higgs mass, as can be seen in Fig. 4. The leading edge shifts to higher transverse masses with increasing Higgs mass. For Higgs masses above \(2{\rm M_{W}}\), the difference in the distributions is reduced due to the increasing momenta of the W bosons of the Higgs decay. Fig. 5 shows the resulting probability density functions for various Higgs masses for signal and background. It can be seen that the sensitivity is strongly reduced due to the presence of the background.

Monte Carlo experiments for five different Higgs masses (160, 170, 180, 184 and 190 GeV) have been performed. The results are shown in Fig. 6 assuming an integrated luminosity of \(\int{\cal L}\it dt\ =\ 100\,{\rm fb}^{-1}\).

For an integrated luminosity of \(\int{\cal L}\it dt\ =\ 30\,{\rm fb}^{-1}\) the method does not work, since the event rate is too low and the difference of the transverse mass distributions is not sufficient to distinguish between them. This leads to non Gaussian distributions of the reconstructed masses. Only a precision of 2-3.5 GeV can be found in the mass range between 170 and 185 GeV.

The variation of the absolute energy scale of 0.1% does not influence the mass reconstruction. In the next step, the shape of the background is varied. First the rate at low \(m_{T}\) is decreased by 10% and increased again by 10% at high \(m_{T}\). A linear variation is used inbetween 50 and 240 GeV. Hence the new \(m_{T}\) distribution P\({}^{\prime}(m_{T})\) is given by

\[{\rm P}^{\prime}(m_{T})\ =\ {\rm P}(m_{T})\cdot(\lambda\cdot m_{T}+\kappa). \tag{4}\]

Again this variation has more influence for M\({}_{\rm H}\)=160 GeV and for M\({}_{\rm H}\)\(\geq\)184 GeV. There a deterioration in the range of 0.2 GeV is detectable. In the mass range inbetween the width is increased by 0.03 resp. 0.05 GeV.

The shift of the peak due to the these systematic variations have been studied and no greater deviation has been found. The systematic error can be appriciated to \(\pm\)1 GeV, which is a conservative estimation. Thus the relative precision is mostly limited by statistics. All results of the systematic study are summerized in Table 3.

In addition to the shape of the transverse mass distribution also the signal rate itself can be taken into account to get a better mass resolution. Using this so-called,,extended Likelihood-method", the Likelihood function contains an extra factor

\[{\cal L}_{E}=\frac{{\rm e}^{\,\rightarrow\,}\phi^{\rm N}}{{\rm N}!}\cdot{\cal L }. \tag{5}\]

Thereby \(\phi\) is the number of expected and N the number of detected signal events. Since the expected event rates depend on the Higgs mass, mass values, which do not correspond to the selected mass, are suppressed by the additional factor, which becomes maximal for \(\phi\)=N. The increased statistical power of the method can be seen from Fig. 7, it is reflected by the narrower distribution of the \(\Delta(\ln({\cal L}))\) values.

As can be seen in Fig. 8, a mass reconstruction is possible over the whole mass range from 160 to 190 GeV assuming an integrated luminosity of \(\int{\cal L}dt\ =\ 30\ {\rm fb}^{-1}\). Using the extended Likelihood-method, all distributions of the reconstructed masses are Gaussian (except for 160 GeV, compare with Fig. 6) and the width has decreased. The satellite peak around 170 GeV in the reconstruction for M\({}_{\rm H}\)\({}^{sel}\)=160 GeV arises due to the same expected signal event rate for the two Higgs masses of 160 and 170 GeV. The statistical error amounts \(\pm\)0.6 GeV for M\({}_{\rm H}\)=170 GeV and \(\pm\)1.6 GeV for M\({}_{\rm H}\)=184 GeV (1.4 GeV respectively 2.7 GeV without extended Likelihood-method). The relative error is between 0.3 and 1.3%. But to get this accuracy one has to keep in mind that the expected signal rates must be known with very good precision.

Due to the three-lepton final state the background level is low, on the other hand, the signal cross section is decreased by a factor of 50. For a detailed description of this channel see Ref. [10].

In the associated channel the same Likelihood-method as in the inclusive production is used for the mass reconstruction. The range of transverse mass used in the fit is from 50 to 295 GeV. The corresponding probability density functions for four different Higgs masses are shown in Fig. 9. The influence of the neutrino of the associated W decay makes the distinction of the distribution more difficult. The low statistics entail an additional complication. As can be seen in Fig. 10 the differences in the probability functions at low transverse masses arise from the normalization of the summed signal plus background shape.

Due to this problems in the associated channel a mass reconstruction is not possible assuming an integrated luminosity of \(\int\mathcal{L}\,dt=100\) fb\({}^{-1}\). Even the additional information of the event rate does not suffice to reconstruct the Higgs mass in the

### Summary

In the channel \(\mathrm{H}\to\gamma\gamma\) a new analysis has been performed using the background shape as predicted by PYTHIA. The fractional error is found to be 0.3-0.5% assuming an integrated luminosity of \(\int\mathcal{L}dt~{}=~{}100~{}\mathrm{fb}^{-1}\) and 0.2-0.3% for 300 fb\({}^{-1}\) in the covered mass range of 110 to 150 GeV.

The channel \(\mathrm{H}\to\mathrm{Z}\mathrm{Z}\to\mathrm{4l}\) offers the best possibility of determining the mass of the Higgs boson. An accuracy of 0.1% is achievable over the whole mass range of 120 to 400 GeV and an integrated luminosity of \(\int\mathcal{L}dt~{}=~{}300~{}\mathrm{fb}^{-1}\). Above \(\mathrm{M}_{\mathrm{H}}\)=400 GeV the statistical precision deteriorates due to the increasing Higgs width but is still in the order of 1%. To get final numbers the interference effects of signal and background must be included in further studies.

As expected, the mass resolution in the inclusive \(\mathrm{H}\to\mathrm{W}\mathrm{W}^{(*)}\to\mathrm{l}\nu\mathrm{l}\nu\) and associated \(\mathrm{W}\mathrm{H}\mathrm{\to}\mathrm{W}\mathrm{W}\mathrm{W}\to\mathrm{l} \nu\mathrm{l}\nu\) channel cannot reach the precision of the \(\mathrm{H}\to\mathrm{Z}\mathrm{Z}^{(*)}\to\mathrm{4l}\) and \(\mathrm{H}\to\gamma\gamma\) channels. In the inclusive channel a relative precision of 0.5-1.4% (0.3-0.9%) is accessible with 100 fb\({}^{-1}\) (300 fb\({}^{-1}\)) integrated luminosity. With the extended Likelihood-method the fractional error is 0.3-1.3% assuming an integrated luminosity of \(\int\mathcal{L}dt~{}=~{}30~{}\mathrm{fb}^{-1}\). In the associated channel a mass reconstruction without the extended Likelihood-method is not possible even with 300 fb\({}^{-1}\) integrated luminosity. Using the extended Likelihood-method the mass can be determined with a relative precision of 1%. It should be pointed out again that this method can only be used if the signal rate is known with good accuracy.

Fig. 12 shows the fractional errors in the considered channels for an integrated luminosity of \(\int\mathcal{L}dt~{}=~{}300\) fb\({}^{-1}\). For the mass reconstruction in the \(\mathrm{W}\mathrm{H}\mathrm{\to}\mathrm{W}\mathrm{W}\mathrm{W}\to\mathrm{l} \nu\mathrm{l}\nu\mathrm{l}\nu\) channel the extended Likelihood-method is used. For the combination of the channels an energy scale uncertainty of \(\pm 0.1\%\) as well as the ATLAS goal of \(\pm 0.02\%\) is taken into account.

The combination of all channels with an uncertainty of 0.1% on the energy scale is represented by the black triangles, the black circles correspond to the combination and an error of 0.02% on the energy scale._

Determination of rates, couplings and width

As already mentioned the measurement of the Higgs parameters is important. After the determination of the rates in the various production and decay channels, constraints on the couplings and branching ratios are possible. Using the \(\mathrm{H}\rightarrow\mathrm{Z}\mathrm{Z}\to 4\mathrm{l}\) channel a differentiation between SM and MSSM may be feasible, since this channel is suppressed in the MSSM. Furthermore the Higgs width differs from SM to MSSM and thus can also be used for the distinction.

### Measurement of the rate

#### 3.1.1 Introduction

Using the signal and background events in a given channel the rate and thus the cross section times branching ratio can be measured. The number of signal events is computed by subtracting the expected background rate \(\langle\mathrm{N_{B}}\rangle\) from all detected events \(\mathrm{N_{S+B}}\). Taking into account the efficiency \(\epsilon\), the acceptance \(\eta\) after all cuts and the integrated luminosity, the cross section times branching ratio is given by

\[\sigma\times\mathrm{BR}\ =\ \frac{\mathrm{N_{S+B}}-\langle\mathrm{N_{B}}\rangle}{ \epsilon\cdot\eta\cdot\int\mathcal{L}\mathrm{dt}}\;. \tag{6}\]

For the computation of the relative precision the error on the detected event rate is \(\sqrt{\mathrm{N_{S+B}}}\). In the channels where the signal appears as a mass peak above the background (\(\mathrm{H}\rightarrow\gamma\gamma\) and \(\mathrm{H}\rightarrow\mathrm{Z}\mathrm{Z}\to 4\mathrm{l}\)) no error on the background rate \(\langle\mathrm{N_{B}}\rangle\) is assumed since the number of background events in the signal region can be largely constraint from the sidebands. The uncertainty of the background is thus given by the statistical fluctuation of the background rate in the mass window of the Higgs resonance. It is already inlcuded in the statistical error on the total event rate \(\mathrm{N_{S+B}}\). In the channels where no background subtraction is possible an additional error of 5% (see chapter 3.1.2) in the \(\mathrm{H}\rightarrow\mathrm{W}\mathrm{W}^{(*)}\rightarrow\mathrm{l}\nu\mathrm{l}\nu\) and \(\mathrm{W}\mathrm{H}\rightarrow\mathrm{W}\mathrm{W}\mathrm{W}\to 1\nu\nu \mathrm{l}\nu\) channel and 10% for \(\mathrm{t}\mathrm{t}\mathrm{H}(\mathrm{H}\rightarrow\mathrm{b}\mathrm{b})\) is assumed. Also an uncertainty of 2% for the efficiency times acceptance is included in the study. This is probably a conservative estimate given by the experience of present experiments. Two different values of 5% respectively 10% are considered for the luminosity uncertainty. Hence the relative error of the cross section times branching ratio is given by

\[\frac{\Delta(\sigma\times\mathrm{BR})}{\sigma\times\mathrm{BR}}\ =\ \frac{\sqrt{\mathrm{N_{S+B}}+\mathrm{N_{S}^{2}}(0.02^{2}+\epsilon_{Lumi}^{2})+( \Delta\langle\mathrm{N_{B}}\rangle)^{2}}}{\mathrm{N_{S+B}}-\langle\mathrm{N_{B }}\rangle} \tag{7}\]

where \(\epsilon_{Lumi}=\Delta(\epsilon\cdot\eta)/(\epsilon\cdot\eta)\) is 0.05 or 0.1 depending on the considered error of the luminosity.

1.2 Error estimation of the background in the channel \({\bf H}\rightarrow{\bf W}{\bf W}^{(*)}\rightarrow{\bf l}\nu{\bf l}\nu\)

In the TDR an uncertainty of 5% on the background is assumed. To check this assumption, the background is now studied in more detail. A suitable variable for the analysis is the opening angle \(\cos\left(\Delta\Phi_{\rm ll}\right)\) of the two leptons in the transverse plane. Due to the spin correlation the opening angle of the two leptons coming from the Higgs decay is smaller on average than that of the leptons arising from background processes. There are only 90 signal events in the range of \(-1\leq\cos\left(\Delta\Phi_{\rm ll}\right)\leq-0.2\) in comparison with 760 events from WW continuum production.

The aim is to parameterize the background distribution and to fit this shape to the data in the region where only few Higgs events are present. Then this fit is extrapolated in the signal region (\(\cos\left(\Delta\Phi_{\rm ll}\right)\geq 0.54\)). Hence there is no need of a precise prediction of the background anymore. However the shape of the background distributions must be known with very good precision from Monte Carlo simulations.

Only the three major backgrounds WW, Wt and and \({\rm t}\overline{\rm t}\) are considered in this study. In the following the parametrizations of the backgrounds will be labeled \(P_{\rm WW}(\Delta\Phi_{\rm ll})\), \(P_{\rm Wt}(\Delta\Phi_{\rm ll})\) and \(P_{\rm tt}(\Delta\Phi_{\rm ll})\). The distributions of the WW and Wt background as well as the signal distribution are shown in Fig. 13. Once the shape of the background is determined, i.e. the functional form is fixed by the Monte Carlo, it can be used to fit the data. For the fit a,,signal free region", which is chosen to be the interval [-1.0,-0.2], is selected. The function which is fitted to the data is

\[P(\Delta\Phi_{\rm ll})=\alpha[P_{\rm WW}(\Delta\Phi_{\rm ll})+P_{\rm tt}(\Delta \Phi_{\rm ll})+P_{\rm Wt}(\Delta\Phi_{\rm ll})]. \tag{8}\]

The value of the fit parameter \(\alpha\) yields to a prediction of the background rate in the signal region \(\cos\left(\Delta\Phi_{\rm ll}\right)\geq 0.54\), whereas the error \(\Delta\alpha\) is used to determine the error of the predicted background rate.

First of all it has to be shown that the extrapolation can describe the background in the signal region without the presence of a Higgs signal. Therefore a Monte Carlo experiment is performed. The fluctuated number of background events is drawn from the background distribution and the extrapolated number of background events is computed using the value of the fitted parameter \(\alpha\). The expected background rate is N\({}_{\rm B}\)=1972 whereas the fit predicts N\({}^{\prime}_{\rm B}\)=1960\(\pm\)64. Figure 14 shows the distribution of the extrapolated background event rate for many different MC experiments. The ratio between expected and extrapolated background is found to be

\[\frac{\rm N_{B}}{\rm N^{\prime}_{B}}=1.006\pm 0.033. \tag{9}\]

The same fit is performed to the summed signal (M\({}_{\rm H}\)=170 GeV) and background distribution (see Fig. 15). The extrapolated background rate is now N\({}^{\prime}_{\rm B}\)=2126\(\pm\)68 and thus 7.3% above the expected one:

\[\frac{\rm N_{B}}{\rm N^{\prime}_{B}}=0.927\pm 0.029. \tag{10}\]

This is not astonishing since the event rate in the fit interval is increased due to the additional signal events. Nevertheless, an excess of signal events in the signal region is still detectable. The ratio of the summed signal and background rate to the extrapolated background rate for \(\cos{(\Delta\Phi_{\rm ll})}\geq 0.54\) is

\[\frac{\rm N_{S+B}}{\rm N^{\prime}_{B}}=1.320\pm 0.042. \tag{11}\]

This is also shown in Fig. 16, where the ratio of the summed signal plus background distribution to the fit is shown. Despite the increased background rate the significance for the discrepancy with the measured rate, assuming no Higgs boson, is still 7.6\(\sigma\).

In the next step, to avoid the overestimation of the background, also a signal contribution has been assumed in the fit. The fit is now performed over the whole \(\cos{(\Delta\Phi_{\rm ll})}\) range from -1 to 1. The new function

\[P^{\prime}(\Delta\Phi_{\rm ll})=\alpha\left[P_{\rm WW}(\Delta\Phi_{\rm ll})+P_ {\rm tt}(\Delta\Phi_{\rm ll})+P_{\rm Wt}(\Delta\Phi_{\rm ll})\right]+\beta P_ {\rm Higgs}(\Delta\Phi_{\rm ll}) \tag{12}\]

has two free parameters, where \(\alpha\) again determines the background rate. Also the signal shape has been assumed from the Monte Carlo, without any uncertainties. The background event rate as predicted by the fit is N\({}^{\prime\prime}_{\rm B}\)=1970\(\pm\)70, while the expected background is N\({}_{\rm B}\)=1972. The corresponding event distribution of many MC experiments is shown in Fig. 17. So using the shape of the signal and of the background, the absolute background rate in the signal region can be determined with a precision of 3.5%. So far, no systematic errors on the signal and background rates have been assumed.

Figure 14: _Distribution of the extrapolated background event rates in absence of a Higgs signal._

To take into account the influence of systematic errors, the \(\rm t\overline{t}\) background is increased by a factor of 1.3. The function \(P^{\prime}(\Delta\Phi_{\rm ll})\) is used again and is adjusted to the data with the 30% increased \(\rm t\overline{t}\) background. Again the interval \([-1.0,1.0]\) is used for the fit. It is obvious that the background rate is enhanced while extrapolating in the signal region. However this increase is not that much, the extrapolated background is found to be \(\rm N_{B}^{\prime\prime}\)=1979\(\pm\)75. In the next step, the shape of the background distribution is changed. Both cases are taken into account, the decrease of the background event rate of 10% at \(\cos(\Delta\Phi_{\rm ll})\)=-1 with simultaneous increase of 10% at \(\cos(\Delta\Phi_{\rm ll})\)=1 and a linear change inbetween and vice versa. Due to the decrease of the rate at low \(\cos(\Delta\Phi_{\rm ll})\) values, the background shape resembles the signal shape and thus the extrapolated event rate decreases. It is found to be \(\rm N_{B}^{\prime\prime}\)=1851\(\pm\)74. In the other case the difference between background and signal shape becomes clearer and the background rate is overestimated (\(\rm N_{B}^{\prime\prime}\)=2090\(\pm\)75). The corresponding rate distribution are shown in Fig. 18. Assuming this 10% variations in the background shape the systematic uncertainties are found to be in the order of \(\pm\)5%.

#### 3.1.3 Results of the rate determination

A precise determination of the rates in the different channels is necessary, because these measurements lead to the determination of the couplings and the width of the Higgs boson (see chapter 3.2 and 3.3). The channels considered in this study are

* \(\rm H\to WW^{(*)}\to l\nu l\nu\) (1)
* \(\rm H\to ZZ^{*}\to 4l\) resp. \(\rm H\to ZZ\to 4l\) (2)
* \(\rm tt\,H(H\to b\overline{b})\) (3)
* \(\rm WH(H\to WW\to l\nu l\nu)\) and \(\rm W\!\to\!1\nu\) (4)
* \(\rm WH(H\to WW\to l^{\pm}\nu\overline{jj})\) and \(\rm W\!\to\!l^{\pm}\nu\) (5)
* \(\rm H\!\to\gamma\gamma\) (6)
* \(\rm tt\,H(H\to\gamma\gamma)\) (7)
* \(\rm WH(H\!\to\gamma\gamma)\) (8)

The channels (2,3,6) have already been discussed in the TDR [1], channel (5), which-together with (4)- is important for the determination of the Higgs coupling to the W boson, is taken from Ref. [11].

The expected signal and background rates for the various channels together with the relative error \(\Delta(\sigma\times{\rm BR})/(\sigma\times{\rm BR})\) are quoted in tables 5-12. The integrated luminosity is assumed to be \(\int{\cal L}\,dt\ =\ 100\) fb\({}^{-1}\), no K-factors are included and the error on the luminosity is 5% respectively 10%. The corresponding curves as function of the Higgs boson mass are shown in Fig. 19 and 20 also taking into account an integrated luminosity of \(\int{\cal L}\,dt\ =\ 300\) fb\({}^{-1}\).

For 110 GeV \(\leq\) M\({}_{\rm H}\leq\)150 GeV the cross section times branching ratio in the channel H \(\rightarrow\gamma\gamma\) can be measured with an accuracy of 20%. Assuming an integrated luminosity of \(\int{\cal L}\,dt\ =\ 300\) fb\({}^{-1}\), the uncertainty can be reduced to 11-15%. The signal to background ratio in the H \(\rightarrow\) Z Z\({}^{(*)}\rightarrow\) 41 channel is definitively better than in the H \(\rightarrow\gamma\gamma\) channel but below 2M\({}_{\rm Z}\) the statistic is not that good. For an integrated luminosity of \(\int{\cal L}\,dt\ =\ 100\) fb\({}^{-1}\) and M\({}_{\rm H}\)=150 GeV a relative error of 14% (17%) is reachable assuming an error of 5% (10%) on the luminosity. Above M\({}_{\rm H}\)=200 GeV the relative precision is in the order of 8% (12%) and deteriorates around M\({}_{\rm H}\)=400 GeV due to the decrease of the signal rate. In the range between 150 and 180 GeV it can be clearly seen that the H \(\rightarrow\) WW\({}^{(*)}\rightarrow\) l\(\nu\)l\(\nu\) channel is essential for a precise rate measurement. The cross section times branching ratio in this channel can be determined with an fractional error of 10% (13%). Increasing the integrated luminosity, an improvement to 7% (11%) is possible.

A precise measurement of the rates is desirable, especially with regard to the couplings, since the ratios of the Higgs coupling to bosons and fermions are extracted from the ratio of the obseerved rates. In addition a good knowledge of the luminosity can minimize the error.

1.4 Distinction between SM and MSSM using the rate measurement in the channel H \(\rightarrow\) Z Z\({}^{(*)}\rightarrow\) 41

As mentioned before, a discrimination between SM and MSSM may be feasible by measuring the rate in the channel H \(\rightarrow\) Z Z\({}^{(*)}\rightarrow\) 41, since this channel is suppressed in the MSSM. Except for \(\tan\beta\leq 1\), the MSSM rates are suppressed by an order of magnitude over most of the parameter space [14].

Due to this low rate in the MSSM, the observability is limited to low values of \(\tan\beta\). In Fig. 21 the rate for the SM with the expected error is shown assuming an integrated luminosity of \(\int{\cal L}\,dt\ =\ 100\) fb\({}^{-1}\). The error on the luminosity is assumed to be 5%. Also shown are the expected MSSM rates for 5 different values of \(\tan\beta\) with l\(\leq\tan\beta\leq\)10. Numbers for the MSSM are taken from [14].

In the mass range around 150 GeV a distinction between SM and MSSM is possible with more than 5\(\sigma\) assuming an integrated luminosity of \(\int{\cal L}dt~{}=~{}100\) fb\({}^{-1}\). Around 130 and 170 GeV, a differentiation is only possible between 2.2 and 4.6\(\sigma\), depending on \(\tan\beta\). This loss in discrimination power is due to the decrease of the rate in the SM. In the mass range above 200 GeV, a distinction with more than 10\(\sigma\) is nearly possible for all values of \(\tan\beta\) except for \(\tan\beta\)=1, where the significance is only 7.6\(\sigma\) for M\({}_{\rm H}\)=200 GeV and \(\sigma\geq 10\) for M\({}_{\rm H}\)\(\geq\)240 GeV. The significances for all considered masses and values of \(\tan\beta\) are listed in Table 13. It should be mentioned that uncertainties due to higher order corrections have been neglected in this estimation.

### Measurement of the couplings

#### 3.2.1 Theoretical introduction

After the measurement of the rate in one channel, a precise theoretical prediction is needed to determine the branching ratio in this channel. Normally these predictions are not available with high accuracy. If the ratio of rates is considered, many theoretical and experimental uncertainties cancel.

For the treatment of the couplings it is useful to study the partial widths \(\Gamma_{\rm i}\), since they are proportional to the square of the coupling \(g_{\rm H\bar{\rm i}}\) of the Higgs boson to particle i. The partial width \(\Gamma_{\rm f}\) of the decay into fermions is given by

\[\Gamma_{\rm f}\ =\ \Gamma({\rm H}\to{\rm f}{\overline{\rm f}})\ =\ c\frac{g_{\rm H }^{2}\pi}{8\pi}{\rm M_{H}}\left(1-\frac{4{\rm m_{f}^{2}}}{{\rm M_{H}}^{2}} \right)^{\frac{3}{2}}\, \tag{13}\]

where \({\rm m_{f}}\) is the fermion mass and c a color factor [15]. Similarly the coupling \(g_{\rm H\,VV}\) of the Higgs boson to a vector boson is given by

\[\Gamma_{\rm V}\ =\ \Gamma({\rm H}\to{\rm VV})\ =\ \delta_{\rm V}\frac{G_{F}}{16 \sqrt{2}\pi}{\rm M_{H}}^{3}\left(1-4x+12x^{2}\right)\beta_{\rm V} \tag{14}\]

with \(x={\rm M_{V}^{2}}/{\rm M_{H}^{2}}\) and \(\delta_{\rm V}\)=2 (1) for V=W (Z).

Due to the coupling in the production and decay, it is possible to express the cross sections in terms of the partial width \(\Gamma_{\rm i}\). It can be shown [16], that the gluon fusion can be written as (in leading order)

\[\sigma({\rm gg}\to{\rm H})\ =\ \Gamma({\rm H}\to{\rm gg})\frac{\pi^{2}}{8{ \rm M_{H}}^{3}}\tau\int_{\tau}^{1}\frac{dx}{x}g(x,{\rm M_{H}}^{2})\,g(\frac{ \tau}{x},{\rm M_{H}}^{2})\, \tag{15}\]

where \(\tau={\rm M_{H}}^{2}/s\). Regarding the Higgs production, the different contributions of the various processes must be taken into account. The total cross section is composed by the gluon fusion, the vector boson fusion and the associated production. QCD corrections are taken into account by K-factors:

\[\Gamma_{\rm g}\cdot{\rm K_{g}}+\Gamma_{\rm W}\cdot{\rm K_{W}}+\Gamma_{\rm t} \cdot{\rm K_{t}}. \tag{16}\]

The K-factors \({\rm K_{g}}\), \({\rm K_{W}}\) and \({\rm K_{t}}\) are different for the various subprocesses. For the gluon fusion process, the NLO K-factor is assumed to be 1.7 for \({\rm M_{H}}\)=100 GeV and 1.8 for \({\rm M_{H}}\)=500 GeV [17]. The uncertainty is in the order of 20% [17] due to the uncertainty in the structure functions. The K-factor of the vector boson fusion has been computed to be 1.08 for a Higgs mass of 100 GeV and 1.06 for \({\rm M_{H}}\)=800 GeV [18]. Here the uncertainty is estimated to be in the order of 5%. Due to the different K-factors an additonal uncertainty appears especially in the determination of the boson/fermion coupling, since channels with gluon fusion and associated production have to be compared (see chapter 3.2.3).

Since the ratios of couplings are considered, the uncertainties arising from the luminosity and the efficiencies mostly cancel. Thus the error on the couplings consists only of the statistical uncertainty and the error in the background subtraction in the H\(\to\)WW and H\(\to\)bb channels.

#### 3.2.2 Coupling to bosons

First the coupling of the Higgs boson to the gauge bosons in the mass range \({\rm M_{H}}\)\(<\)2\({\rm M_{Z}}\) is examined. This can be done with a direct measurement using the rates of the two decay channels \(\,{\rm H}\rightarrow{\rm WW}^{(*)}\rightarrow{\rm 1}\nu{\rm 1}\nu\) and \(\,{\rm H}\rightarrow{\rm Z}{\rm Z}^{*}\rightarrow{\rm 4}{\rm 1}\). In both channels the same production processes are involved. The ratio of the couplings to W and Z bosons is then given by

\[\frac{\sigma\times{\rm BR}({\rm H}\rightarrow{\rm WW}^{*})}{\sigma\times{\rm BR }({\rm H}\rightarrow{\rm Z}{\rm Z}^{*})}=\frac{(\Gamma_{\rm g}\cdot{\rm K}_{ \rm g}+\Gamma_{\rm W}\cdot{\rm K}_{\rm W}+\Gamma_{\rm t}\cdot{\rm K}_{\rm t}) \Gamma_{\rm W}}{(\Gamma_{\rm g}\cdot{\rm K}_{\rm g}+\Gamma_{\rm W}\cdot{\rm K}_ {\rm W}+\Gamma_{\rm t}\cdot{\rm K}_{\rm t})\Gamma_{\rm Z}}=\frac{\Gamma_{\rm W }}{\Gamma_{\rm Z}}\;. \tag{17}\]

To get a complete cancelation of the production processes, the contributions from associated processes have to be rejected or they have to have the same efficiencies. As long as exclusive topologies can be considered, the QCD corections cancel and thus the theoretical uncertainty is reduced.

Since the \(\,{\rm H}\rightarrow{\rm WW}^{(*)}\rightarrow{\rm 1}\nu{\rm 1}\nu\) channel is only measurable above \({\rm M}_{\rm H}{\geq}150\) GeV, the coupling is also only measurable above this limit. For a 150 GeV Higgs boson the theoretical ratio of the W/Z coupling is 8.37. This value can be determined at ATLAS with a relative precision of 20% assuming a running time of one year at \({\cal L}=10^{3}\)\({\rm cm}^{-2}{\rm s}^{-1}\). The ratio increases at higher Higgs masses, since the cross section in the \(\,{\rm H}\rightarrow{\rm Z}{\rm Z}^{*}\rightarrow{\rm 4}{\rm 1}\) channel drops. Thus the precision deteriorates due to the lower ZZ\({}^{*}\) statistics. The theory predicts a value of \(\Gamma_{\rm W}/\Gamma_{\rm Z}{=}43.2\) at \({\rm M}_{\rm H}{=}170\) GeV. This can be tested with an accuracy of 29%. The accuracy over the whole accessible mass range is shown in Fig. 22 for an integrated luminosity of \(\int{\cal L}\,dt\ =\ 100\) fb\({}^{-1}\) and \(\int{\cal L}\,dt\ =\ 300\) fb\({}^{-1}\).

Besides the direct measurement in the mass range \({\rm M}_{\rm H}{>}\) 150

Figure 22: _Relative precision of the direct and indirect measurement of the W to Z boson coupling ratio assuming an integrated luminosity of \(\int{\cal L}\,dt\ =\ 100\) fb\({}^{-1}\) (left) and \(\int{\cal L}\,dt\ =\ 300\) fb\({}^{-1}\) (right). For the indirect measurement an error of 10% (open symbols) on the ratio between \(\Gamma_{W}\) and \(\Gamma_{\gamma}\) (see text) is included. The closed symbols correspond to the values where this error is not considered._

determination is feasible in the mass range \({\rm M_{H}}\!<150\) GeV by using the \({\rm H\to\gamma\gamma}\) and \({\rm H\to ZZ^{*}\to 4l}\) channels. The Higgs decay into two photons proceeds via a diagram (see Fig. 23), where the loop is dominated by a WW pair. The partial width \(\Gamma_{\gamma}\) is given by [19]

\[\Gamma({\rm H\to\gamma\gamma})\ =\ \frac{\alpha^{2}g^{2}}{1024\pi^{3}}\frac{{ \rm M_{H}}^{3}}{{\rm M_{W}}^{2}}\left|\sum_{i}N_{c_{i}}e_{i}^{2}F_{i}\right|^{ 2}\, \tag{18}\]

where

\[F_{1}\ =\ 2+3\tau+3\tau(2-\tau)f(\tau) \tag{19}\] \[F_{1/2}\ =\ -2\tau[1+(1-\tau)f(\tau)]\]

with \(\tau=4{\rm m_{i}^{2}}/{\rm M_{H}}^{2}\) and

\[f(\tau)\ =\ \left\{\begin{array}{ll}\left[\sin^{-1}\left(\sqrt{1/\tau} \right)\right]^{2},&\tau\geq 1,\\ -\frac{1}{4}\left[\ln\left(\eta_{+}/\eta_{-}\right)-i\pi\right]^{2},&\tau<1; \end{array}\right. \tag{20}\]

where \(\eta_{\pm}\equiv(1\pm\sqrt{1-\tau})\). The sum runs over all charged particles. Thus one gets access to \(\Gamma_{\rm W}\) via \(\Gamma_{\gamma}\) (\(\Gamma_{\rm W}=\alpha\cdot\Gamma_{\gamma}\)).

Using equations (14) and (18) the propotionality constant can be computed. Due to higher order corrections this constant is affected by a theoretical uncertainty \(\Delta\alpha\), which is assumed to be 10% for the \(\Gamma_{\rm W}\) and \(\Gamma_{\gamma}\) case. The same uncertainty is assumed for the ratio of \(\Gamma_{\rm t}\) to \(\Gamma_{\rm g}\) (see below).

Using the proportionality between \(\Gamma_{\rm W}\) and \(\Gamma_{\gamma}\) the mass range between 120 and 150 GeV can be covered via

\[\frac{\sigma\times{\rm BR}({\rm H\to\gamma\gamma})}{\sigma\times{\rm BR}({\rm H \to ZZ^{*}})}=\frac{\Gamma_{\rm g}\,\Gamma_{\gamma}}{\Gamma_{\rm g}\,\Gamma_{ \rm Z}}\sim\frac{\Gamma_{\rm W}}{\Gamma_{\rm Z}}. \tag{21}\]

The analysis is done without and with the assumption of the 10% error on the proportional constant \(\alpha\). The relative precision of this measurement is 28% (assuming no uncertainty on \(\alpha\))and 30% (assuming a 10% uncertainty) for an integrated luminosity of \(\int{\cal L}dt\ =\) 100 fb\({}^{-1}\). Due to the low statistics the error increases to 41% (42%) for \({\rm M_{H}}\)=120 GeV. With a running time of three years at \({\cal L}=10^{34}\) cm\({}^{-2}\)s\({}^{-1}\), the relative error reduces to 16% (19%) above \({\rm M_{H}}\)=130 GeV (see Fig. 22). The results for the direct as well as the indirect measurement are summarized in Table 14.

#### 3.2.3 Coupling to fermions

In comparison with the boson/boson coupling ratio, the fermion/boson coupling is affected by more theoretical uncertainties and the measurement is restricted at LHC.

The theoretical uncertainties arise since two different production processes, gluon fusion and associated production, must be compared to get the coupling ratio. Thus unequal K-factors due to higher order QCD corrections occur. In addition the channels H\(\rightarrow\) b\(\overline{\mbox{b}},\mbox{c}\overline{\mbox{c}},\tau\tau\) are not detectable. May be the channel H\(\rightarrow\tau\tau\) is measureable using a W fusion tagging [3].

To get the ratio \(\Gamma_{\rm W}/\Gamma_{\rm t}\) the inclusive Higgs production with subsequent decay into \(\gamma\gamma\) resp. WW are compared with the processes, where the Higgs boson is produced together with a W boson,

\[\frac{\sigma\times{\rm BR}\,({\rm WH}\rightarrow\gamma\gamma)}{ \sigma\times{\rm BR}\,({\rm H}\rightarrow\gamma\gamma)} = \frac{\Gamma_{\rm W}\Gamma_{\gamma}}{\Gamma_{\rm g}\Gamma_{\gamma }}\sim\frac{\Gamma_{\rm W}}{\Gamma_{\rm t}}*C_{QCD} \tag{22}\] \[\frac{\sigma\times{\rm BR}({\rm WH}\rightarrow{\rm WWW})}{\sigma \times{\rm BR}({\rm H}\rightarrow{\rm WW}^{*})} = \frac{\Gamma_{\rm W}\Gamma_{\rm W}}{\Gamma_{\rm g}\Gamma_{W}}\sim \frac{\Gamma_{\rm W}}{\Gamma_{\rm t}}*C_{QCD}\;, \tag{23}\]

where \(C_{QCD}\) is the ratio of the K-factors between associated and direct production.

Only an indirect determination is possible, since the domination of the \({\rm t}\overline{\mbox{t}}\) pairs in the quark loop of the gluon fusion is used to express \(\Gamma_{\rm t}\) through \(\Gamma_{\rm g}\). As mentioned before, a theoretical uncertainty of 10% is included for the proportionality constant.

The ratio of the Higgs coupling to W bosons and top quarks can be measured over the whole mass range from \({\rm M}_{\rm H}\)=80 GeV to \({\rm M}_{\rm H}\)=2\({\rm M}_{\rm Z}\). The accuracy of this measurement is dominated by the low statistics in the associated channel, especially in the WH(H\(\rightarrow\gamma\gamma\)) channel (see Table 11). The relative error is 46% for \({\rm M}_{\rm H}\)=120 GeV and even 67% for a 80 GeV Higgs boson. Above 150 GeV, the relative error is only between 18 and 27%. To get this relative precision, the two associated processes WH(H\(\rightarrow\)WW\(\rightarrow\) l\(\nu\)l\(\nu\)) and WH(H\(\rightarrow\)WW\(\rightarrow\) l\(\nu\)l\(\bar{\mbox{j}}\)) must be combined. An extension of the running time leads to an obvious improvement of the measurement. Due to the better statistics for \(\int{\cal L}\,dt\,=\,300\) fb\({}^{-1}\), the fractional error is in the order of 26 to 38% in the H\(\rightarrow\gamma\gamma\) channel and about 12 to 19% considering the Higgs decay into WW.

In this case theoretical uncertainties mostly vanish, since in both processes the Higgs boson is produced together with a \({\rm t\bar{t}}\) pair. This again is an indirect measurement because the proportionality between \(\Gamma_{\rm W}\) and \(\Gamma_{\gamma}\) is used. The fractional error is in the order of 57 to 70% for an integrated luminosity of \(\int{\cal L}dt\ =\ 100\) fb\({}^{-1}\). An increase to \(\int{\cal L}dt\ =\ 300\) fb\({}^{-1}\) leads to a relative precision of 31 to 34%.

It has to be pointed out, that a strict separation between the two associated channels \({\rm t\bar{t}}\)H and WH must be ensured. In this study the percentage of the \({\rm t\bar{t}}\)H and WH production is taken from Ref. [13].

The fractional error of the three boson/fermion couplings is listed in Table 15 and presented in Fig. 24.

### Measurement of the total width

#### 3.3.1 Theoretical introduction

The tot al width \(\Gamma\) of the Higgs boson is in the order of \(10^{-3}\) to \(10^{-1}\) GeV for \(\rm M_{H}\)\(\leq\)\(2\rm M_{Z}\)[20] (see Fig. 25). The expected detector resolution in this mass region is assumed to be 1.2-1.4 GeV [1]. Thus the intrinsic width is 2-3 orders of magnitude smaller and no direct measurement is possible. Above 200 GeV Higgs mass, the intrinsic width is in the range of the detector resolution and increases rapidly with increasing Higgs mass. In this analysis only the mass range below 200 GeV is handled. Results for the measuremnt of \(\Gamma\) in the range \(\rm M_{H}\)\(<\)\(2\rm M_{Z}\) have been given in Ref. [1]. To determine the width of the Higgs boson despite of its small intrinsic width, the method, which is proposed in Ref. [3], can be used.

The total width of the Higgs boson is dominated by the decays into \(\rm b\overline{b}\), \(\rm c\overline{c}\), WW, ZZ, gg, \(\gamma\gamma\) and \(\tau\tau\). Indeed these channels are only partially or not at all detectable in the considered mass range. The part of the total width which cannot be measured is taken into account by the parameter \(\epsilon\). Thus \(\epsilon\) is given by

\[\epsilon = 1-[{\rm BR(H\to b\overline{b})}+{\rm BR(H\to WW)}+{\rm BR(H\to ZZ)}+ \tag{25}\] \[{\rm BR(H\to gg)}+{\rm BR(H\to\gamma\gamma)}+{\rm BR(H\to\tau\tau)}] \ \ll\ 1\.\]

Multiplying by \(\Gamma_{\rm W}\) leads to \(\Gamma_{\rm W}(1-\epsilon)\), which is referred to as \(\tilde{\Gamma}_{\rm W}\) in the following:

\[\Gamma_{\rm W}(1-\epsilon)\ =\ [\Gamma_{\rm b}+\Gamma_{\rm W}+\Gamma_{\rm Z}+ \Gamma_{\rm g}+\Gamma_{\gamma}+\Gamma_{\tau}]\frac{\Gamma_{\rm W}}{\Gamma}\ =:\ \tilde{\Gamma}_{\rm W} \tag{26}\]

Due to the SU(2) symmetry, the H\(\rightarrow\)WW and H\(\rightarrow\)ZZ decays are related in the SM, and \(\Gamma_{\rm Z}\) can be expressed through \(\Gamma_{\rm W}\):

\[\Gamma_{\rm Z}\ =\ {\rm z}\cdot\Gamma_{\rm W} \tag{27}\]

An uncertainty on \(\alpha\) (see text) of 10% (row 2,4) is taken into account._Since the \(\tau\) and the b quark are both third generation fermions with isospin \(-\frac{1}{2}\), their partial widths are connected by the ratio of the masses, i.e.

\[{\rm y}=\frac{\Gamma_{\rm b}}{\Gamma_{\tau}}=3c\frac{{\rm m}_{b}^{2}\left({\rm M }_{\rm H}\right)}{{\rm m}_{\tau}^{2}}\;. \tag{28}\]

Neglecting the partial width \(\Gamma_{\gamma}\) and rewriting

\[\frac{\Gamma_{\rm W}\Gamma_{\rm W}}{\Gamma}=X_{\rm W} \frac{\Gamma_{\tau}\Gamma_{\rm W}}{\Gamma}=X_{\tau}\] \[\frac{\Gamma_{\rm Z}\Gamma_{\rm W}}{\Gamma}=X_{\rm Z} \frac{\Gamma_{\rm g}\Gamma_{\rm W}}{\Gamma}=Y_{\rm g}\]

the partial width \(\tilde{\Gamma}_{\rm W}\) is given by

\[\tilde{\Gamma}_{\rm W} = [1+{\rm y}]\cdot X_{\tau}+[1+{\rm z}]\cdot X_{\rm W}+Y_{\rm g} \tag{29}\] \[= [1+{\rm y}]\cdot\zeta\cdot\sigma\times\,{\rm BR}({\rm qq}\to{ \rm qq}{\rm H}({\rm H}\to\tau\tau))+[1+{\rm z}]\cdot\xi\cdot\sigma\times\,{ \rm BR}({\rm W}{\rm H}\to{\rm WWW})\] \[+\varrho\cdot\sigma\times\,{\rm BR}({\rm H}\to{\rm WW})\;.\]

Once the partial width \(\tilde{\Gamma}_{\rm W}\) is determined, the total width \(\Gamma\) resp. \(\tilde{\Gamma}\) is given by

\[\tilde{\Gamma} = \Gamma(1-\epsilon)^{2}\ =\ \frac{\tilde{\Gamma}_{\rm W}^{2}}{X_{\rm W}}\] \[= \frac{1}{\xi\cdot\sigma\times\,{\rm BR}({\rm W}{\rm H}\to{\rm WWW} )}([1+{\rm y}]\cdot\zeta\cdot\sigma\times\,{\rm BR}({\rm qq}\to{\rm qq}{\rm H }({\rm H}\to\tau\tau))\] \[+[1+{\rm z}]\cdot\xi\cdot\sigma\times\,{\rm BR}({\rm W}{\rm H}\to{ \rm WWW})+\varrho\cdot\sigma\times\,{\rm BR}({\rm H}\to{\rm WW}))^{2}\;.\]

Most of the ratios \(\Gamma_{i}\Gamma_{j}/\Gamma\) are only accessible through the vector boson fusion process, which has not been studied in ATLAS so far. \(X_{\rm W}\) and \(X_{\rm Z}\) can be measured using the associated \({\rm W}{\rm H}({\rm H}{\rm\to WW})\) channel, whereas the inclusive process \({\rm H}{\rm\to WW}\) covers \(Y_{\rm g}\). But \(Y_{\rm g}\) is negligible in comparison with \(X_{\rm W}\), since it is 2-3 orders of magnitude smaller for \({\rm M}_{\rm H}{\rm>}150\) GeV. Neglecting \(Y_{\rm g}\), equation (30) yields \(\tilde{\Gamma}=[1+z]\tilde{\Gamma}_{\rm W}\), thus no measurement of the total width is possible in this mass range since with the detectable channels only the partial width \(\tilde{\Gamma}_{\rm W}\) is measureable. In this considered mass range, the branching ratio in WW and ZZ is above 95% [20], except for \({\rm M}_{\rm H}{\rm=}150\) GeV (\(\Gamma_{\rm b}/\Gamma\approx 17\%\)).

Assuming that a W fusion tagging is possible, the width measurement in the mass range from 120 to 150 GeV is also feasible. Due to this separation of gluon and vector boson fusion, the channels \({\rm qq}{\rm\to qq}{\rm H}({\rm H}{\rm\to\tau\tau})\) and \({\rm qq}{\rm\to qq}{\rm H}({\rm H}{\rm\to WW})\) can be isolated from the background. The study in the mass range below \({\rm M}_{\rm H}{\rm=}150\) GeV is based on the numbers quoted in Ref. [3].

#### 3.3.2 Results of the determination of the total width

The error of the total width \(\Gamma\) of the Higgs boson as well as the error of the partial width \(\tilde{\Gamma}_{\rm W}\) is dominated by the low statistics in the associated channel. The relative precision of \(\tilde{\Gamma}_{\rm W}\) is in the order of 17 to 24% (5% error on the luminosity) and 19 to 26% (10% error on the luminosity) assuming an integrated luminosity of \(\int{\cal L}\,dt~{}=~{}100~{}{\rm fb}^{-1}\). Running ATLAS three years at \({\cal L}=10^{34}~{}{\rm cm}^{-2}{\rm s}^{-1}\), the error decreases to 11 to 15% (14 to 17%). As mentioned above no measurement of the total width is possible for M\({}_{\rm H}\)\(>\)150 GeV. The results for Higgs masses between 150 and 190 GeV for the partial width are summerized in Table 16.

If the vector boson fusion tagging is possible, the measurement of the Higgs width in the mass range between 120 and 150 GeV is in reach. The predicted precision of the rate measurement in this channels is 6% to 20%. The partial width \(\tilde{\Gamma}_{\rm W}\) can then be determined with a relative error of 10 to 13% (12 to 15%) for an integrated luminosity of \(\int{\cal L}\,dt~{}=~{}100~{}{\rm fb}^{-1}\). Assuming \(\int{\cal L}\,dt~{}=~{}300~{}{\rm fb}^{-1}\), the error is in the order of 7 to 8% (10 to 12%). These numbers lead to an fractional error \(\Delta\tilde{\Gamma}/\tilde{\Gamma}\) of 32% (37%) for M\({}_{\rm H}\)=120 GeV and 20% (26%) for M\({}_{\rm H}\)=150 GeV. After a runtime of three years, the error can be reduced to 14 to 20% (22 to 27%). The value of the parameter \(\epsilon\) is \(\epsilon\)=0.07 for M\({}_{\rm H}\)=120 GeV and \(\epsilon\)=0.1 for M\({}_{\rm H}\)=140 GeV [20]. The expected fractional errors in the mass range below 150 GeV are quoted in Table 17. All results are also presented in Fig. 26.

## 4 Determination of the spin

### Method of the spin determination

A good approach for the fixing of the spin is provided by the method of Nelson [4],[5]. Here the decay correlation function

\[F(\phi)=1+\alpha\cos\phi+\beta\cos 2\phi \tag{31}\]

for the decay of a spin 0 particle into two vector bosons is studied. The angle \(\phi\) is defined between the decay planes Z \(\rightarrow\) l\({}^{+}\)l\({}^{-}\) (resp. W\({}^{+}\rightarrow\) l\({}^{+}\nu_{l}\) and W\({}^{-}\rightarrow\) l\({}^{-}\bar{\nu}_{l}\)) (see Fig. 27). A transformation in the rest frame of one of the vector bosons is performed. The z-axis is given by the negative momentum of the other vector boson. The decay plane of this boson defines the x-z-plane. The y-axis is chosen in the way, that one gets a

Figure 27: _Definition of the angle \(\phi\). \(V_{1}\) resp. \(V_{2}\) are vector bosons, A\({}_{1}\), A\({}_{2}\), B\({}_{1}\) and B\({}_{2}\) leptons._righthanded coordinate system. The decay plane of the latent vector boson is projected on the x-y-plane. Then \(\phi\) is the angle between the x-axis and this projection.

The two parameters \(\alpha\) and \(\beta\) are given by

\[\alpha = \left(\frac{3\pi}{8}\right)^{2}\frac{\gamma}{1+\gamma^{2}/2}\] \[\beta = \frac{1}{4}\frac{1}{1+\gamma^{2}/2}\, \tag{32}\]

where \(\gamma\) is \(\gamma=({\rm M_{H}}^{2}-2{\rm M_{V}}^{2})/2{\rm M_{V}}^{2}\). If the Higgs boson decays into two Z bosons, the parameter \(\alpha\) inlcudes an additional factor \({\cal T}^{2}\) with \({\cal T}=-2r/(1+r^{2})\), where \(r\) is the axial vector to vector coupling coefficient. For a leptonic decay of the Z boson, this parameter amounts \({\cal T}\simeq-0.237\). Fig. 28 shows the two parameters \(\alpha\) and \(\beta\) and the decay correlation function \(F(\phi)\).

With increasing Higgs mass the decay correlation function becomes flat. Hence there is no information anymore, so the spin analysis is only performed in the \({\rm H}\to{\rm Z}\,{\rm Z}^{(*)}\to 41\) channel up to \({\rm M_{H}}\)=400 GeV.

After applying all cuts in the channel, the shape of the distribution changes (see Fig. 29). Particularly at small and large angles, more events do not pass the cuts. Thus it is necessary to perform an acceptance correction. The correction function \(\chi(\phi)\) is computed using the theoretical decay correlation function \(F(\phi)\) and a parametrisation of the shape after all cuts as predicted by the Monte Carlo. This correction function is also shown in Fig. 29. After reweighting the events with \(\chi(\phi)\), the angle distribution corresponds again with the theoretical curve. The shape of the background is believed from the Monte Carlo.

### Determination of the spin for \(\mathbf{M_{H}}\)\(<\) 2\(\mathbf{M_{Z}}\)

The signal with 4 leptons offers a clear signature, but due to the small cross sections, the spin determination in the mass range below 2\(\mathrm{M_{Z}}\) is not possible with an integrated luminosity of \(\int\mathcal{L}\mathit{dt}\ =\ 30\ \mathrm{fb}^{-1}\). Assuming an integrated luminosity of \(\int\mathcal{L}\mathit{dt}\ =\ 100\ \mathrm{fb}^{-1}\), the statistical error is still relatively large. Thus a weakening of the isolation and impact parameter cuts is performed to increase the signal rate. The signal efficiencies and corresponding rejection factors are taken from Ref. [21].

In the TDR a rejection factor of 800 for the \(\mathrm{t\overline{t}}\) background and 50 to 90, depending on the final state 4e, 4\(\mu\) or 2e2\(\mu\), for the \(\mathrm{Zb\overline{b}}\) background is used. Applying this cuts the signal efficiency is between 47 and 58%, again depending on the final state.

While increasing the signal efficiency, the background also enlarges. Thus an enhancement of the signal efficiency is not unrestricted possible and a compromise between better efficiency of the signal and not to big enlargement of the background must be found. It has been found that an increase of the signal of 30% can be reached without a too large increase of the background. The signal efficiency then is 68.8% compared to 52.5% with the cuts which are used in the TDR. At the same time the \(\mathrm{t\overline{t}}\) background increases by a factor of 6.96 and the \(\mathrm{Zb\overline{b}}\) background by a factor of 2.92. For the resultant rejection of the background, the correlation between isolation and impact parameter cuts is taken into account. This correlation is found to be 10% for \(\mathrm{t\overline{t}}\) and 40% for \(\mathrm{Zb\overline{b}}\)[21]. The expected event rates without and with weakening of the cuts are listed in Table 18.

Using the event rate without as well as with weaker rejection, the reconstructed parameters fit well with the theoretical prediction. For example the parameter \(\alpha\) is found to be \(\alpha=-0.0306\pm 0.2052\) for \(\mathrm{M_{H}}\)=150 GeV and without weaker rejection. The theory predicts \(\alpha=-0.0259\). For the same Higgs mass, the parameter \(\beta\) is found to be \(\beta=0.2571\pm 0.1800\) while the expectation is \(\beta=0.2353\). Due to the weakening of the rejection cuts the error decreases about 11 to 15% over the considered mass range from 120 to 180 GeV. All results are summerized in Table 19 and presented in Fig. 30.

To study the influence of systemic errors, the dependancy on the energy scale as well as the change shape of the background was examined. The analysis has shown that there is no influence while changing the energy scale. Likewise the change of the background distribution shows no systematic shift of the reconstructed parameters. Only an increase of the error of about 5% is detectable.

### Determination of the spin in the mass range between 200 and 400 GeV

Unlike in the intermediate mass range, the events rates above 200 GeV are high enough and no change of the cuts has to be done. The spin analysis is performed without and

#### 4.3.1 Correction of the \(\rm p_{T}(Z)\) distribution of the background

As can be seen in Fig. 31, PYTHIA [7] underestimates the \(\rm p_{T}(ZZ)\) distribution at high transverse momentum [22]. This is caused by the neglect of the higher order corrections which are assumed to be present for \(\rm p_{T}(ZZ)\). Since there is a cut on \(\rm p_{T}\), more events are rejected as it would be the case with a correct discription of the transverse momentum. Thus the backround rate is underestimated.

To equalize this, a correction function \(\xi(\rm p_{T})\) is computed, with which the \(\rm p_{T}\) distribution of the background is reweighted. Since the theoretical curve is only accessible for \(\sqrt{s}=15.4\)TeV and a top mass of m=150 GeV, the \(\rm p_{T}(ZZ)\) for these values is generated with PYTHIA and fitted. The theoretical curve and the fit are shown in Fig. 32. For low \(\rm p_{T}\), the correction factor is found to be \(\xi=1\). Above 300 GeV/c a constant factor \(\xi(\rm p_{T})=\xi(300\) GeV/c) is assumed. In the range between 50 and 300 GeV/c the correction factor depends on the transverse momentum. The correction function is also shown in Fig. 32.

By applying the correction factor, one has to keep in mind, that the cross section of the background is increased by a factor of 1.34 whereas no K-factors are included for the signal. In addition it is supposed that the computed correction function \(\xi\) of the \(\rm p_{T}(ZZ)\) spectrum can be transferred to the \(\rm p_{T}\) distribution of one individual Z boson.

#### 4.3.2 Determination of the parameter \(\alpha\) and \(\beta\)

Over the whole mass range a good consistency with spin 0 can be found. The reconstructed parameter fit well with the theoretical demand. For example the parameter \(\alpha\) is found to be \(\alpha=-0.0487\pm 0.0921\) for M\({}_{H}\)=260 GeV, the theory demands \(\alpha=-0.0487\). Here no cut on the \(\rm p_{T}\) is used. Assuming the same Higgs mass \(\beta\) is found to be \(\beta=0.0451\pm 0.0913\) compared to a theoretical value of \(\beta=0.0439\).

Under consideration of the \(\rm p_{T}\) cut, the good agreement with the theory is still there. Due to the decrease of the background, the error is reduced, but there is only a change in the order of 2%. Applying the correction function, the background increases and thus the precision deteriorates. But still there is a good consistency with spin 0. Since

Figure 31: _Comparison of the \(\rm p_{T}(ZZ)\) distribution as predicted by PYTHIA and the theoretical run of the curve [22]._

the event rate is higher than in the intermediate mass range, the relative precision is obviously better.

Again the analysis of systematic errors shows no influence on the reconstructed parameters. But an increases of the error in the mass range around 200 GeV can be found while changing the energy scale. The error increases by a factor of about 30% whereas the increase for heavy Higgs bosons is only in the order of 2-5%. The change of the background distribution has the same effects on the errors as the variation of the energy scale. The error deteriorates by a factor of 1.3 for M\({}_{\rm H}\)=200 GeV and only in the order of 5% for M\({}_{\rm H}\)\(\geq\)260 GeV.

The reconstructed values of \(\alpha\) and \(\beta\) are listed in Table 20 and shown in Fig. 33.

## 5 Conclusion

The goal of this study was an investigation with what precision the parameters of a SM Higgs boson can be measured in the ATLAS experiment at LHC. For the mass determination, the two channels \({\rm H}\rightarrow\gamma\gamma\) and \({\rm H}\rightarrow{\rm ZZ}^{(*)}\rightarrow{\rm 4l}\) offer the best possibility due to the resonance peak above the background. An relative precision of 0.1% can be reached in the mass range between 120 and 400 GeV assuming an integrated luminosity of \(\int{\cal L}dt\ =\ 300\) fb\({}^{-1}\). For Higgs masses above 400 GeV the relative precision is in the order of 1%. The shift of the resonace peak due to the interference of signal and non resonant background must be included in further studies. In the \({\rm H}\rightarrow{\rm WW}^{(*)}\rightarrow{\rm l}\nu{\rm l}\nu\) and \({\rm WH}\)\(\rightarrow{\rm WWW}\rightarrow{\rm l}\nu{\rm l}\nu\) channels, the relative precision is only 0.3-1.3% in the mass range of 150 to 190 GeV. The worse mass reconstruction is mainly due to the neutrinos in the final state.

Using this rates, the ratio of the Higgs coupling to bosons and fermions can be determined. The relative precision is in the order of 20 to 60%. One has to keep in mind, that the uncertainties arising from QCD corrections, are not taken into account. In addition, some of the coupling ratios can only be measured indirectly, using the proportionality between the coupling to \(\gamma\)'s and W bosons. If it is possible to seperate between Higgs production through gluon and vector boson fusion, also an indirect measurement of the total width can be performed in the mass range M\({}_{\rm H}\)\(<\)150 GeV. The total width is measureable with a relative precison of 14 to 20% assuming an integrated luminosity of \(\int{\cal L}\,dt\,=\,300\) fb\({}^{-1}\). In the mass range 150 GeV\(<\)M\({}_{\rm H}\)\(<\)2M\({}_{\rm Z}\) only the partial width \(\Gamma_{\rm W}\) can be determined and the accuracy is in the order of11 to 15%.

For the spin determination a good consistency with spin S=0 can be demonstrated in the mass range between 120 and 400 GeV. For more quantitative statements, it is necessary to compare these results for an analysis, where a particle with spin S\(\neq\)0 is considered.
