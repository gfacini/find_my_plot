###### Abstract

ATLAS prototype p-in-n and n-in-n detectors were irradiated to 3\(\times\)10\({}^{14}\) protons \(cm^{-2}\) at the CERN PS. Afterwards they underwent a controlled thermal annealing programme to simulate 10 years of LHC operation. During annealing the leakage current and the full depletion voltage were observed as a function of time [1]. An analysis of the time evolution of the full depletion voltage and the leakage current is carried out in this paper. In addition, we measured the damage constant for the irradiated detectors and present a detailed investigation of the temperature and frequency dependence of the full depletion voltage.

## Introduction

Detectors from various manufacturers were irradiated in the CERN PS irradiation facility with 24 GeV protons. Simulations of the expected dose in the ATLAS inner tracker over a ten year period lead to a maximum fluence of 1.4 \(\times\)10\({}^{14}\) equivalent 1 MeV neutrons \(cm^{-2}\). Taking into account an estimated fluence error of 50%, and the proton hardness factor, detectors were irradiated to a total fluence of 3 \(\times\)10\({}^{14}\)protons \(cm^{-2}\).

During 10 years of LHC operation the ATLAS detector will be operated at -7\({}^{\circ}\)C. For maintenance purposes a yearly warm-up of 2 days at 20\({}^{\circ}\)C and 2 weeks at 17\({}^{\circ}\)C is foreseen, [2]. The ten year effect of this warm-up can be simulated on a shortened time scale by using the Ziock parameterisation. An annealing time of 21 days at 25\({}^{\circ}\)C is equivalent to the above described warm-up scenario, and leads to an increase in depletion voltage of \(\sim\) 30% compared to the minimum [3, 4].

Nine ATLAS prototype detectors were irradiated to 3 \(\times\)10\({}^{14}\)protons \(cm^{-2}\) and underwent controlled thermal annealing to study the effects of yearly warm-ups in the ATLAS detector.

## Experiment

The ATLAS prototype silicon strip detectors have a sensitive area of 62 \(\times\) 61.6 \(mm^{2}\)[2] with 768 readout strips. The thickness of the detectors varied between 280 and 340\(\mu\)m. All data presented have been normalised to 300\(\mu\)m, scaled according to the root of the thickness for the depletion voltage and linearly for the leakage current. Nine detectors underwent the annealing programme, representing a selection of p-in-n and n-in-n detectors from different manufacturers, see table 1.

During the irradiation the detectors were cooled to -8\({}^{\circ}\)C \(\pm\)1\({}^{\circ}\)C and biased at 150 V. Immediately after irradiation the detectors were stored in a freezer at -10\({}^{\circ}\)C for about two weeks.

During the annealing programme the leakage current and full depletion voltage were monitored continuously. All measurements were taken in a climate cabinet at -8 or -10\({}^{\circ}\)C in order to limit the leakage current.

## Results and Discussion

### Damage Constant

For detectors irradiated to a given fluence the increase in leakage current is directly proportional to the fluence. The proportionality is described by the damage constant \(\alpha\), which has a value of 2 - 10\(\times\)10\({}^{-17}\)_Acm\({}^{-1}\)_ at 20\({}^{\circ}\)C immediately after irradiation [5, 6].

\[\Delta I_{Vol}=\alpha\,\phi \tag{1}\]

\(\Delta I_{Vol}\) describes the change in volume leakage current, at a given fluence \(\phi\), compared to pre-irradiation values.

The damage constant has been calculated for a selection of detectors that were irradiated with 24 GeV protons at the CERN PS. I-V characteristics were taken at fluences of 1.2\(\times\)10\({}^{14}\)_pcm\({}^{-2}\)_ and 3\(\times\)10\({}^{14}\)_pcm\({}^{-2}\)_. Using the current values at 300 V the changes in leakage current were determined at the two fluences for five detectors. The data have been normalised to 300\(\mu\)m thickness and 20\({}^{\circ}\)C.

The fluence has been determined from measurements of the activation of aluminium foils [7], using the number of protons registered per spill as a cross-reference. The error of the fluence calculation using aluminium foils has previously been determined to be \(\pm\) 6%, [6]. The temperature has been monitored continuously during the irradiation and fluctuations of \(\pm\)1\({}^{\circ}\)C have been registered.

The generation leakage current depends directly on the temperature of the detector, as can be seen from equation 2:

\[I_{g}\,\propto T^{3/2}\exp(-E_{g}/2kT), \tag{2}\]

where \(T\) is the temperature in Kelvin and \(k\) is the Boltzmann constant.

The band gap value, \(E_{g}\), is 1.2eV [8]. The error in leakage current measurements due to fluctuations in temperature was found to be negligible. The current measurements were carried out in the irradiation area using a multichannel source measure unit, where the accuracy of the meter is of the order of 0.5 \(\mu\)A.

The damage constant has been determined for leakage current values at -8\({}^{\circ}\)C. By normalising the leakage current to 20\({}^{\circ}\)C we obtained the values for \(\alpha\) at 20\({}^{\circ}\)C. The values for the damage constant in table 2 reflect the temperature dependence of the leakage current.

Calculating the mean of the damage constant at +20\({}^{\circ}\)C using the values given

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|c|l|} \hline Detector & Type \\ \hline \hline Canberra 71 & p-in-n \\ \hline Eurysis 80 & p-in-n \\ \hline Hamamatsu Barrel 97-4 & n-in-n \\ \hline Hamamatsu Wedge 12-1 & n-in-n \\ \hline Hamamatsu Special 10 & n-in-n \\ \hline Hamamatsu Special 21 & n-in-n \\ \hline MP1 7 & p-in-n \\ \hline Sintef n70 & n-in-n \\ \hline Sintef p17 & p-in-n \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 1: Detectors used in the annealing test.

in table 2 and taking into account the above mentioned errors in leakage current and fluence one obtains a value of 2.83\(\times\)10\({}^{-17}\)\(\pm\)0.24\(\times\)10\({}^{-17}\)_Acm\({}^{-1}\)_ at 20\({}^{\circ}\)_C_. The data have not been corrected for self-annealing during the irradiation since the detectors were kept at -8\({}^{\circ}\)C, and annealing effects are assumed to be negligible.

The mean value obtained for the damage constant at 20\({}^{\circ}\)C is in accordance with recently quoted data of 2 - 5\(\times\)10\({}^{-17}\)_Acm\({}^{-1}\)_, [8]. It should be emphasised that the value used for normalisation to 20\({}^{\circ}\)C was _E\({}_{g}\)_ /2=0.6 eV. Values between 0.53 eV [6] and 0.68 eV [9] have been used in previous studies. Differences in the normalisation energy value cause a significant change in the value of the damage constant corrected to 20 \({}^{\circ}\)C, of up to 15%.

### Current Annealing

After the irradiation the detectors were stored at 25\({}^{\circ}\)C to simulate 10 years of ATLAS operation. During this time an annealing of the leakage current has been observed [1]. Figure 3 illustrates this behaviour for the Hamamatsu Special and the Hamamatsu Wedge 12-1 detector. An exponential decay has been observed for the leakage current measured as a function of annealing time. Between the end of irradiation and day 15 of annealing, the leakage current of detector Hamamatsu Special 10 decreases by around 25%. The Hamamatsu Wedge 12-1 detector could be measured over the 21 day annealing programme, and shows a leakage current decrease of \(\sim\) 40 % between the beginning and end of the annealing, see figure 4. This decrease in leakage current has been observed in previous publications, [5, 6].

### Current Stability

The leakage current stability of the irradiated detectors was measured during the annealing process by biasing the detectors at 500V and measuring the current at 30 second intervals for one hour. Using a Keithley 237 source measurement unit the leakage current could be measured with an accuracy of the order of 100 nA. This level of bias ensured that the detectors were fully depleted and in addition this measurement gave information on the stability of the current at high voltages. Measurements were carried out in a climate cabinet set to -10\(\pm\)0.1 \({}^{\circ}\)_C_. The temperature was additionally monitored using a Pt100 sensor placed directly next to the detector. Figure 4 shows the current stability measurements for a selection of irradiated detectors. For all detectors measured the leakage current was stable over the measurement time, illustrating the stability of highly irradiated detectors at high bias voltages. The designs and processes have been optimised for high voltage operation to account for the full depletion voltage increase expected at high fluences. The leakage current stability can clearly be seen in figure 5.

It was found that I-V characteristics improved after biasing the detectors at a high voltage for one hour. This is especially illustrated for the Eurysis 80 detector which was damaged with glue before irradiation in the guard ring region and indicated breakdown at around 420V after irradiation. After biasing

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|} \hline Detector & \(\alpha\) at -8\({}^{\circ}\)C & \(\alpha\) at +20\({}^{\circ}\)C \\ \hline \hline Canberra 71 & 2.15 \(\times\)10\({}^{-18}\) & 3.06 \(\times\)10\({}^{-17}\) \\ \hline Eurysis 80 & 1.53 \(\times\)10\({}^{-18}\) & 2.18 \(\times\)10\({}^{-17}\) \\ \hline MPI 7 & 2.37 \(\times\)10\({}^{-18}\) & 3.38 \(\times\)10\({}^{-17}\) \\ \hline Sintef n9 & 1.81 \(\times\)10\({}^{-18}\) & 2.58 \(\times\)10\({}^{-17}\) \\ \hline Sintef p17 & 3.42 \(\times\)10\({}^{-18}\) & 2.95 \(\times\)10\({}^{-17}\) \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}

The error has been propagated from leakage current and fluence errors to a value of 0.24 \(\times\)10\({}^{-17}\)_Acm\({}^{-1}\)_the detector at 500V for one hour the I-V characteristic improved, and breakdown could no longer be seen. Figure 3 shows an I-V characteristic showing breakdown which was taken on day 17 of the annealing. Also shown is an I-V measurement carried out immediately after a stability measurement with the detector biased at 500V with no indication of breakdown.

### Capacitance Measurements

Capacitance measurements have been carried out for a range of frequencies and temperatures on the irradiated Hamamatsu Wedge 12-1 detector. The setup used is described in [1], using an HP4284A LCR meter. With this setup it was possible to measure frequencies at 20Hz, 30Hz, 80Hz, 100Hz, 200Hz, 500Hz and 1 kHz.

Previous studies [10, 11] have shown that the capacitance depends both on the frequency and temperature of the measurement. The full depletion voltage has been determined from the capacitance measurements by fitting lines to a region of decreasing capacitance at low voltages and a region of constant capacitance at higher voltages. The full depletion voltage is defined by the intersection of these fits. A maximum uncertainty of \(\pm\)10 V is estimated due to the fitting procedure. Measurements have been carried out between -20\({}^{\circ}\)C and 0\({}^{\circ}\)C and could not be carried out at higher temperatures due to high leakage currents.

Figure 3 shows the full depletion voltages as a function of temperature, measured at different frequencies. Lines have been fitted to the data. For all frequencies the depletion voltage decreases linearly with temperature. Over the temperature range of 20K the mean variation of the full depletion voltage for all frequencies is 9.5 % \(\pm\) 3.0 %. This corresponds to a mean change in depletion voltage of 28 \(\pm\) 10 V. This is in accordance with previous publications, which claim a 1.5-20% change over 50K [10].

Figure 3 shows the full depletion voltage as a function of frequency carried out at different temperatures. The extrapolated depletion voltage decreases exponentially with increasing frequency. The mean change in full depletion voltage between 20Hz and 1kHz has been determined for measurements at 0, -5 and -10 \({}^{\circ}\)C to be 59 \(\pm\) 10V. This corresponds to a relative change of 20.0 % \(\pm\) 3.4 %. This value is higher than that found for a change in temperature as discussed above. Previous results [10] have observed a similar amount of change for the full depletion voltage measured as a function of temperature or of frequency. Contrary to our results these measurements were carried out at frequencies above 1kHz. Due to the exponential behaviour we expect a higher change in depletion voltage for our chosen frequency range. It is believed that radiation induced defects determine the frequency dependence of irradiated detectors, [11].

The effects of very low frequency measurements have been analysed, comparing measurements at 20, 30, 80 and 100 Hz. For a given temperature the full depletion voltages for all frequencies agree within the measurement error. A comparison of measurements made at -10, -5 and 0 \({}^{\circ}\)C does however show a systematic increase in the full depletion voltage, as can be seen in figure 3.

### Full Depletion Voltage

Capacitance measurements were carried out at regular intervals during the annealing period, using the setup and procedure described in [1]. To allow a better determination of the depletion voltage the measurements were carried out at the lowest available frequency of 100Hz, using the HP4 263B LCR meter. The ambient temperature during the measurements was -8 or -10 \({}^{\circ}\)C. The time dependence of the full depletion voltage can be seen in figure 3. All measurements were carried out under the same thermal conditions and at 100Hz to ensure comparability of the measurements.

For all detectors included in the warm-up scenario the full depletion voltage was measured over the annealing period. The obtained value for the depletion voltage can not be considered to be the absolute value due to frequency and temperature dependence. However, all detectors were measured at the same temperature and frequency and can thus be compared, see figure??. No systematic difference could be observed between p-in-n and n-in-n detectors. For one detector, Sintef p17, the depletion voltage is about 150 V at the minimum, where for all other detectors this value is around 100V higher. This difference is not fully understood and further investigation is required to explain this interesting feature.

Two of the selected detectors could be measured continuously over the full annealing period of 21 days. The time dependence of the full depletion voltage, \(V_{de\,p}(t)\), as a function of annealing time as parameterised by Ziock [3] is given in equation 3.

\[V_{de\,p}(t) = V_{Z}+V_{S}\exp(-t/\tau_{S}) \tag{3}\] \[+V_{A}(1-\exp(-t/\tau_{L}\,)).\]

\(V_{Z}\) represents the depletion voltage due to the stable radiation induced acceptor concentration. \(V_{S}\) is related to the meta stable radiation induced acceptor concentration. \(V_{A}\) is related to the fraction of defects that can become active acceptor sites. The time dependence of the full depletion voltage can be separated into a short and a long-term annealing. The short-term annealing is believed to be dominated by the decay of radiation induced acceptor sites back to neutral inactive sites with a time constant \(\tau_{S}\), [3]. At longer times the full depletion voltage increases due to the transformation of defects into active acceptor sites, described by the time constant \(\tau_{L}\). Two detectors were measured over a period of 21 days and fitted with the Ziock parameterisation. In this time regime the anti-annealing part can still be considered linearly proportional to the annealing time. Therefore to reduce the number of free parameters the term describing the anti-annealing part was apparted with a line:

\[V_{dep}(t)=V_{Z}+V_{S}\exp(-t/\tau_{S})+(V_{A}/\tau_{L})t \tag{4}\]

Equation 4 was used to apply fits to the data of the Hamamatsu Wedge 12-1 and the Hamamatsu Special 10 detectors. Comparison of our data with the Ziock parameterisation at 25\({}^{\circ}\)C indicates a minimum in full depletion voltage at around day eight instead of day four. The parameter \(\tau_{S}\) was therefore estimated to be approximately two times higher than predicted from the Ziock parameterisation. \(\tau_{S}\) was fixed to a value of 2 days in the fitting procedure in order to reduce the number of free parameters. From equation 4 the ratio of \(V_{A}/\tau_{L}\) can be represented by a single parameter. The starting values for the fit, except for \(\tau_{S}\), were taken from the Ziock parameterisation at 25\({}^{\circ}\)C and are shown in table 3.

Figure?? shows the fitted data indicating

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|} \hline  & Ziock & Hamamatsu & Hamamatsu \\  & Value & Wedge 12-1 & Special 10 \\ \hline \hline \(V_{Z}\)(V) & 318 & 189\(\pm\)16 & 231\(\pm\)18 \\ \hline \(V_{S}\)(V) & 402 & 529\(\pm\)269 & 676\(\pm\)274 \\ \hline C(V/d) & 5.59 & 4.52\(\pm\)1.02 & 7.14\(\pm\)1.07 \\ \hline \(\tau_{S}\)(d) & 2 & & \\ \hline \(\chi^{2}/ndf\) & - & 0.6/5 & 4.1/4 \\ \hline \end{tabular}

an initial beneficial annealing period followed by anti-annealing. The parameters obtained from the fit are summarised in table 3.

The fit was applied using the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm to search for the coefficient values that minimise chi-square, [12]. This is a form of non-linear, least-square fitting. Errors of \(\pm\) 10 V were assumed on each measurement point. The low number of data points, leading to a low number of degrees of freedom and high correlations between some parameters do cause difficulties for the fitting procedure.

Generally the fit applied to the Hamamatsu Wedge 12-1 detector seems to follow much more the predicted parameters and therefore gives a much better value of \(\chi^{2}\). The fit to the data of the Hamamatsu Special 10 detector does also follow the predicted form but not as well. The low number of measurement points has a significant influence on the quality of the fit. On both detectors the same general trend of anti-annealing as predicted by the Ziock parameterisation could be observed. The full depletion voltage measured after 21 days of annealing is approximately 1.2 times greater than that measured at the minimum.

## Conclusions

Nine detectors from different manufacturers were irradiated at the CERN PS with 24GeV protons. After approximately 300 hours the final fluence of \(3\times 10^{14}cm^{-2}\) was reached. During the irradiation the detectors were maintained at -8\({}^{\circ}\)C and biased at 150V. Immediately after irradiation they were stored in a freezer at -10\({}^{\circ}\)C for approximately 2 weeks. A controlled thermal annealing program was carried out to study the effects of yearly warm-ups in the ATLAS SCT throughout the foreseen 10 years of operation. The Ziock parameterisation was used to carry out this study on a shorter time scale. From this the same amount of anti-annealing as reached in 10 years of ATLAS operation can be achieved by warming the detectors for 21 days at 25\({}^{\circ}\)C.

The damage constant has been calculated from current measurements carried out in the irradiation area at different fluences. A mean value of \(2.83\times 10^{-17}\pm 0.24\times 10^{-17}\)_Acm\({}^{-1}\)_ at 20\({}^{\circ}\)C was obtained.

During the annealing current stability measurements were carried out to investigate the stability of highly irradiated detectors at high bias voltages. The designs and processes of all detectors measured have proven to provide stable current conditions at 500V bias voltage.

The dependence of the full depletion voltage on the capacitance measurement frequency and temperature has been investigated. An exponential dependence is found for measurements at different frequencies. A linear decrease with decreasing temperature was found.

The Ziock parameterisation has been used to fit the full depletion voltage data obtained over the annealing period. The same trend of initial beneficial annealing and anti-annealing at longer time scales has been observed.
