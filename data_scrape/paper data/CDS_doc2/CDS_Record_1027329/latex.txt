###### Abstract

In 2004 an ATLAS Combined Test Beam (CTB) was performed in the CERN North area. A complete slice of the barrel detector and of the muon end-cap was tested to study the combined detector performance. In this note we present an analysis of the muon energy loss in the Liquid Argon and Tile calorimeters and its correlation with the momentum measured with the MDT detectors for muons deflected by a dipole magnet in the range \(100-350~{}GeV\).

Introduction

The 2004 Combined Test Beam [1] (Figure 1) offered the first opportunity to acquire data from various ATLAS detectors at the same time. The CTB included elements of all the sub-detectors of the ATLAS Barrel \(-\) the Inner Detector (Pixel, SCT, TRT), the electromagnetic calorimeter (LAr), the hadronic calorimeter (Tilecal), the muon system (MDT and RPC) \(-\) as well as elements of the muon end cap system (MDT, TGC and CSC). In the followings a brief description of the muon and calorimeter detectors, which will be the subjects of the whole work, is given.

### Calorimeter system

The LAr module and the three Tilecal modules were placed on a common table that could rotate and translate in such a way the beam could hit a specific \(\eta\) cell (Figure 2). The Tilecal modules were in contact (with an air gap of 28 \(mm\)) with the LAr cryostat and they were 1942 \(mm\) long. The Tile modules were radially segmented (along the beam direction) into three layers (or samples) corresponding, at \(\eta=0\), to 1.4, 3.9 and 1.8 hadronic interaction lengths respectively. The LAr module was divided into three radial samples as well for a total of 24 \(X_{0}\) at \(\eta=0\).

Figure 1: _The CTB layout: the distance between the calorimiter system and the interaction point (assumed to be on the axis of the H8 beam, at the front surface of the Inner Detector magnet) is about \(6\ m\), while the beam line intersects the first muon barrel chamber about \(34\ m\) away from the interaction point._

### Muon set-up

The muon system set-up (Figure 3) included a full barrel tower (six MDT chambers \(-\) two BILs, two BMLs and two BOLs \(-\), four BML and two BOL RPCs) and an end-cap octant (six MDT chambers - two EIs, two EMs and two EOs -, three TGCs and one CSC). In addition one BIL chamber on a rotating support was installed upstream of the barrel tower. MDT chambers were operated at their nominal conditions: \(Ar\) (93%) and \(CO_{2}\) (7%) mixture at 3 \(bar\) absolute pressure with a high voltage of 3080 \(V\).

A two meter long dipole magnet (MBPL) was installed downstream the first BIL chamber, in front of the muon barrel stand with vertical orientation of the field. Another one meter long [2] magnet (MBPS) was installed between the EI and EM stations of the end-cap stand. Magnets were used to steer the beam and allow momentum measurements.

## 2 Energy loss in calorimeters using muon spectrometer information

In this section a study using the combined information from the muon and calorimeter systems is presented. The main aim of the work is to measure the momentum distribution of muons with large energy loss in the calorimeters and compare results with the Geant4[3] based simulation.

### Energy loss of muons in matter

A nice review of formulae and calculations of the muon energy loss in different media can be found in [4]. Muons loose their energy in matter mainly via electromagnetic processes: ionization, bremsstrahlung and direct pair production.

Figure 2: The calorimiter system layout.

#### 2.1.1 Ionization

The energy loss of a muon with energy \(E\) due to ionization is described by the Bethe-Bloch formula

\[\frac{dE}{dx}=\alpha^{2}2\pi N\lambda_{e}^{2}\frac{Zm_{e}}{A\beta^{2}}\left\{\ln \frac{2m_{e}\beta^{2}\gamma^{2}E_{m}^{\prime}}{I^{2}\left(Z\right)}-2\beta^{2}+ \frac{E_{m}^{\prime 2}}{4E^{2}}-\delta\right\}\]

where \(\alpha\) is the fine structure constant, \(N\) is Avogadro's constant, \(Z\) and \(A\) are the atomic and mass number of the traversed medium, \(\lambda_{e}\) is the electron Compton wavelength, \(I(Z)\) is the mean ionization potential of the medium, \(E_{m}^{\prime}\) is the maximum energy transferable to the electron and \(\delta\) is the density correction [5].

#### 2.1.2 Bremsstrahlung

The cross-section for muon bremsstrahlung has been computed by Petrukhin an Shestakov [6] and can be written as

\[\frac{d\sigma}{dv}=\alpha^{3}\left(2Z\lambda_{e}\frac{m_{e}}{m_{\mu}}\right)^{ 2}\frac{1}{v}\left(\frac{4}{3}-\frac{4}{3}v+v^{2}\right)\phi\left(\delta\right)\]

where \(v\) is the fraction of energy transferred to the photon. The approximation for \(\phi\left(\delta\right)\) can be found in [6]. The mean energy loss due to bremsstrahlung can be calculate solving the integral

Figure 3: The muon spectrometer layout: the muon setup starts about \(12\)\(m\) away from the interaction point (the BOS MDT chamber placed downstream the calorimeter system). The beam line intersects the BIL station about \(34\)\(m\) away from the interaction point and the distance between each MDT barrel station is about \(2\)\(m\). The distance between the EI and the BOL stations is about \(2\)\(m\), and the EM and EO stations are about \(47\)\(m\) and \(55\)\(m\) away from the interaction point respectively. The BOS and BIS MDT chambers upstream the barrel stand were used for specific calorimeter studies.

\[\frac{dE}{dx}=E\frac{N}{A}\int_{v_{\rm min}}^{v_{\rm max}}v\frac{d\sigma}{dv}dv\]

between \(v_{\rm min}=0\) and \(v_{\rm max}=1-\frac{3Z^{1/3}m_{\mu}}{4E}\sqrt{e}\).

#### 2.1.3 Direct electron pair production

The direct pair production cross-section was parametrized by Kokoulin and Petrukhin using a QED calculation [7] and it can be expressed as

\[\frac{d^{2}\sigma}{dvd\rho}=\alpha^{4}\frac{2}{3\pi}\left(Z\lambda_{e}\right)^ {2}\frac{1-v}{v}\left(\phi_{e}+\frac{m_{e}^{2}}{m_{\mu}^{2}}\phi_{\mu}\right)\]

where \(\rho=\frac{E^{+}-E^{-}}{E^{+}+E^{-}}\) is the asymmetry parameter of the electron-positron pair and \(\phi_{e}\) and \(\phi_{\mu}\) correspond to different QED diagrams [8]. The energy loss due to pair production can be calculated solving the integral

\[\frac{dE}{dx}=2E\frac{N}{A}\int_{v_{\rm min}}^{v_{\rm max}}v\int_{0}^{\rho_{\rm max }}\frac{d^{2}\sigma}{dvd\rho}d\rho dv\]

Figure 4: Muon energy loss in iron: the different contributions to the energy loss are shown. The term corresponding to photonuclear interactions is well described in [4].

Figure 4 shows the different contributions to the muon energy loss as computed in [4]. How these electromagnetic processes are implemented by the GEANT4 simulation toolkit can be found in [9].

### Data samples

Processed data samples (about 250000 events) refer to combined runs taken in November 2004. The beam was made up of pions with an energy of \(350~{}GeV\). The trigger assertion was given by the coincidence of signals coming from two scintillating counter systems: the first one, upstream the Inner Detector region, covered an area of \(3\times 3\)\(cm^{2}\), while the second one, in the muon region, was made up of two \(10\times 10~{}cm^{2}\) scintillators. The trigger allowed to select muons (as products of the pion decay) among a large number of pions. Calorimeters were placed at \(\eta\sim 0.55\). The muon momentum was measured by the deflection angle in the magnetic field of the MBPS dipole.

### Muon momentum measurement

The muon momentum was measured comparing the muon track angle in the end-cap stand in runs with the magnet switched on and off. Using this method the momentum was computed as

\[P(GeV)=\frac{0.3BL(Tm)}{\Delta\theta}\]

being \(\Delta\theta=\Delta\alpha_{B\neq 0}-\Delta\alpha_{B=0}\) the difference between the track angle in the EM-EO end-cap and in the BOL-BIL barrel chambers with the magnet switched on and off respectively. The \(BL\) value was \(2~{}Tm\). Assuming a \(\Delta\theta\) resolution of about \(200~{}\mu rad\) then a momentum resolution of about \(20~{}GeV\) was expected. The measured muon momentum distribution is shown in Figure 5: the range of momentum values was compatible with the expected energy of muons decaying from \(\sim 350~{}GeV\) pions.

### Simulation procedure

The simulation was performed using the \(CTB\_G4Sim\)[10] package in the ATHENA [11] framework. Events were produced following some simple rules:

* A muon beam was generated with an energy profile tuned on experimental data;
* Only calorimeter signals were simulated: we were only looking at the particle energy and momentum _after_ the calorimeters (_i.e.,_ in the muon spectrometer) and at the energy loss (\(E_{loss}\)) _in_ calorimeters;
* Calorimeters were put at \(\eta\sim 0.55\) as in the real set-up to be sure that particles crossed the same amount of material.

#### 2.4.1 Beam energy profile

The first step in simulation was to generate a beam energy profile similar to the one observed in experimental data. The muon momentum spectrum shown in Figure 5 was used to generate muons with the correct energy distribution.

Figure 6 shows the comparison between experimental and simulated energy profiles. Since the muon momentum was measured downstream the calorimeter system and the beam \(E_{loss}\) before the muon spectrometer had to be guessed at the particle generation level, a little shift between the two distributions can be noticed.

#### 2.4.2 LAr and Tile response

To test the goodness of the calorimeter response a topological clustering algorithm was used to reconstruct the muon \(E_{loss}\) both in LAr and Tile. The algorithm groups calorimeter cells in clusters based on their neighbor relations and on the significance of their energy contents.

As shown in Figure 7 the distribution of the difference between the Tile and LAr response and the true total \(E_{loss}\) had a mean value of \(\sim 500\ MeV\) and an \(RMS\) of \(\sim 1\ GeV\). This small shift was considered as negligible with respect to the energy

Figure 5: _Muon momentum measured in muon spectrometer._scale relevant for this study and therefore the topological clustering was used in this analysis.

Figure 8 shows the muon \(E_{loss}\) as a function of the muon energy: as expected from the brief excursus in Section 2.1, greater the beam energy greater the energy released in calorimeters.

### Experimental data and simulation comparison

In the data analysis two main cuts were applied to accept an event:

* A good track had to be reconstructed in the muon spectrometer. This criterion ensured the selection of muon events.
* The \(E_{loss}\) in both electromagnetic and hadronic calorimeters had to be greater than zero. This cut was useful to remove the calorimeter noise.

Figure 9 shows the energy in LAr and Tile as a function of \(\eta\) and \(\phi\) of cells: the signal due to the passage of particles is clearly visible over a flat noise. Then

Figure 6: Muon momentum spectrum in the spectrometer for measured and simulated data. Both distributions were normalized to the same number of events.

Figure 7: _Distribution of the difference between LAr+Tile response and true energy loss (up) and calorimeter response as a function of the true energy loss (down). Data points were fitted with a first degree polynomial._

for selected events the \(E_{loss}\) was computed applying the same algorithm used for simulated data (topological clustering).

A first comparison between experimental and simulated data \(E_{loss}\) distributions showed a poor agreement. Figure 10 shows an excess of events with high \(E_{loss}\) present in experimental data with respect to the simulated data both for LAr and Tile.

A first attempt to understand the nature of the difference between experimental and simulated data was to look at the correlation between the \(E_{loss}\) in calorimeters and the muon momentum measured in the muon spectrometer. A clear difference between simulation (Figure 11.1) and experimental data (Figure 11.2) was due to events with large \(E_{loss}\) and large momentum in the spectrometer (of the order of \(\sim 300~{}GeV\)).

A simple hypothesis was to tag these events as the cause of the large \(E_{loss}\) overabundance present in experimental data. To understand the meaning of this signature the same plot as in Figure 11.2 was produced for each of the three Tile radial layers (Figure 12). The plot referring to the third layer (Figure 12.3) demonstrated a correlation much more similar to what observed in simulated events (Figure 11.1) than the one referring to the fist layer (Figure 12.1), even if both layers had almost the same hadronic interaction lengths. This was the proof that almost the whole energy overabundance was contained in the first two Tile layers. This evidence lead to the assumption of an accidental pion contamination in the selected events.

Figure 8: Energy loss as a function of muon energy from simulation for events with \(E_{loss}\)\(>\)\(50~{}GeV\).

In fact, since the beam had a very large pion component, the probability to have an accidental pion contamination in the data was not negligible. To have an estimate of the pion component in the beam, the \(3\times 3\)\(cm^{2}\) scintillating counter rate (_i.e._ the particle rate before the calorimeter system, mainly pions) was about 100 \(KHz\), while the \(10\times 10\)\(cm^{2}\) scintillating counter measured a rate of about 10 \(KHz\) (_i.e._ the particle rate after the calorimeter system, mainly muons). Taking into account an integration window of 100 \(ns\) for the Tile the probability to have an accidental pion contamination could be computed as

\[p=\frac{1}{\tau}\int_{0}^{t_{1}}e^{-\frac{t}{\tau}}dt\sim\frac{t_{1}}{\tau}=0.01\]

where \(\tau\sim 10^{-5}\)\(s\) and \(t_{1}=10^{-7}\)\(s\). This value was in agreement with the fraction of events (0.9%) characterised by both \(E_{loss}\) and \(Momentum\) between 200 and 350 \(GeV\).

### Single muon event selection

The procedure to reject accidental pions was based upon two assumptions:

* The probability for a muon to have a large energy loss due to bremsstrahlung or pair production in more than one Tile radial layer is very small;

Figure 9: Energy in Tile (up) and LAr (down) as a function of cell \(\eta\) (left) and \(\phi\) (right).

Figure 11: Scatter plots showing the correlation between the \(E_{\text{loss}}\) in calorimeters and the muon momentum measured in the muon spectrometer for simulated (11.1) and experimental data (11.2).

Figure 10: Tile (10.1) and LAr (10.2) \(E_{\text{loss}}\) distributions for experimental and simulated data. Histograms were normalized to the same number of events (the reported number of entries refers to the histograms before the normalization).

* The muon energy loss due to bremsstrahlung or pair production is well contained within a single Tile radial layer (each layer corresponding to many electromagnetic radiation lengths).

Following this hypothesis only events with a Minimum Ionizing Particle (MIP) at least in two out of the three Tile samples were selected. The MIP energy cut was of \(1~{}GeV\) in the first and third Tile sample and of \(2~{}GeV\) in the second sample. Figure 13 shows the \(E_{loss}\) distribution in the experimental data for each Tile sample.

The application of this selection criterion let the correlation between the \(E_{loss}\) in calorimeters and the muon momentum measured in the muon spectrometer agree with simulation prediction as shown in Figure 14.

An independent proof that for some events not only muons were crossing the calorimeter system was given by the peak value of the \(E_{loss}\) distribution in LAr (Figure 15). The most probable value of the Landau distribution used to fit the data

Figure 12: Experimental data: scatter plots showing the correlation between the \(E_{loss}\) in each Tile radial layer and the muon momentum measured in the muon spectrometer.

was \((0.604\pm 0.001)~{}GeV\) for single muon selected events, while it was \((1.06\pm 0.06)\)\(GeV\) for accidental pion contaminated events. It was evident that on average for pion contaminated tagged events more than one MIP crossed the LAr calorimeter.

Another hint demonstrating the accidental pion contamination was suggested by the correlation between the LAr and Tile \(E_{loss}\) before and after the single muon event selection cut (Figure 16). The application of single muon event criterion granted for the acceptance of events with no pions showering in calorimeters.

After applying the single muon event selection cut a new comparison between experimental and simulated data \(E_{loss}\) distributions was done (Figure 17). The agreement between data and simulation became very good as demonstrated by the fraction of events in different \(E_{loss}\) bins reported in Table 1.

Conclusions

The fraction of muons with _catastrophic_ energy losses in calorimeters has been investigated. Results from experimental data analysis have been compared to a GEANT4 simulation of the calorimeter and muon spectrometer systems. Simulation parameters were tuned on experimental data run conditions. In particular the beam energy profile was correctly reproduced to avoid biases in energy released in calorimeters. Furthermore same reconstruction and analysis algorithms were used both in simulation and for experimental data.

The combined set-up allowed to use the muon spectrometer and calorimeter information to understand an initial disagreement between simulation and experimental data due to an accidental pion contamination. After single muon event selection the probability for a muon to have an energy loss greater than \(10~{}GeV\) was calculated to be \((3.27\pm 0.05)\%\) for simulation and \((3.37\pm 0.05)\%\) for experimental data analysis.
