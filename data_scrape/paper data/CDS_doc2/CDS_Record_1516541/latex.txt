Introduction

This note has been written as a backup document for the ATLAS Phase 2 Letter Of Intent (LOI) which is due for completion towards the end of 2012. In the following sections the design of the Local Support structure for the barrel strip section of the inner tracker (commonly referred to as a stave) is presented. In section 2 the basic elements of the barrel strip stave design are defined. Section 3 describes the assembly steps and tooling needed to assemble staves and to mount the silicon modules upon them. Finally section 4 presents an estimate of the percentage radiation length of fully populated staves.

### Barrel Strip Tracker Layout

The detector elements of the barrel section of the strip tracker are arranged as a series of concentric cylindrical measuring planes covering a radial extent from about 300mm out to close to 1m. The precise geometrical layout of these elements is constrained by the optimal active sensor area, realised from a 6-inch silicon wafer, of approximately 97mm square. The exact radial positions of each measuring plane, the active length in Z and the angle between the normal to the stave surface and a radial line from the interaction point to the middle of the stave (the tilt angle) are currently being optimised using physics simulations.

Ideally the transition from the cylindrical barrel measuring planes to the disk-based endcap measuring planes should avoid any gaps in coverage in \(\eta\). The natural way to achieve this would be to reduce the radius of the outermost barrel such that a track emanating at Z=-2\(\sigma\) and clipping the end-most barrel module would also clip the active area of an endcap disk at its outer radius. However, reducing the radius significantly compromises the Pt resolution in the barrel and therefore the largest possible radius is chosen, creating a gap in full-hit coverage that is defined by the active-to-active Z spacing of the end of the barrel and the first plane of endcap disks. Whilst the presence of the gap is tolerated it is important to ensure that it is minimised and therefore, it is preferable if the stave design minimises the length of any inactive space in the barrel/endcap transition region.

In addition to the physics performance requirements staves must be robust enough to survive handling during module-mounting, testing, shipping and ultimately insertion into the global support structure. We envisage that staves will be mounted into a transport/testing frame prior to module mounting and will only be removed during insertion.

To final phase of the construction of the barrel strip tracker involves the integration of all the staves into a preassembled global support structure formed of a series of concentric carbon-fibre composite support cylinders. This constraint leads to the requirement that staves have to be inserted from the ends of the barrel structure and mechanisms and procedures have to be developed to ensure a stave can be inserted without risk of damage to it or its neighbours.

## 2 Local Support Structure Design

In this section we begin by describing the basic architecture of a stave and then move to discussing the mechanical and cooling aspects of the design, the interfaces to the services at the end-of-stave (EOS) region and to the global support structures. Finally we discuss the requirements for achieving the required module-to-stave internal alignment and robustness of the design with respect to thermal runaway.

### Stave Architecture

Barrel staves are formed from a carbon-fibre composite sandwich core with embedded cooling structures and integrated electrical services upon which 24 single-sided silicon detector modules are mounted. The primary functions of the core are to provide a stable, low mass support for the modules with adequate cooling capability to inhibit the onset of thermal runaway during the operational life-time of the tracker. The stave is mounted via a number of mounting brackets and referencing components upon a global support structure which defines the primary spatial reference location for large-scale connections of staves, and by implication, the ensemble of silicon detector modules. Towards the Z=1.2m end of the stave the electrical connections from the individual modules on each side of the stave are brought together at an End-Of-Stave card which forms the on-stave part of the interface to the external services interconnect.

The dimensions of a stave are dictated by the requirement to support 12 modules on each side together with the space needed for the various connections between the module and the bus tape and the bus tape to the EOS card. The thickness of a stave is determined by the requirements for longitudinal stiffness and the diameter of the cooling tube. Current staves are typically 1200mm long by 120mm wide) and about 5.4mm thick with extra space (either an extension in length or a widening of the stave at the Z=1.2m end) being required for the EOS card. From a layout perspective, the z-dimension of the inactive area at Z=1.2m should be minimised to reduce gap in full-hit coverage at the barrel/endcap transition.

### Stave Core Mechanics

The stave core is formed from two face sheets which sandwich a core formed from the cooling components and a low density core material together with various edge close-outs and ancillary components which combine to form the on-stave part of the mechanical interface to the global support structure. Historically there have been two designs of stave core which employ many common features and materials choices. These designs differ only in the perceived merits of two different schemes for the mechanical interfaces to the global support structures. Figure 1 shows a schematic of the internal structure of the stave core.

Figure 1: Schematic of the internal structure of a stave core

#### 2.2.1 Face sheets

Face sheets are formed from layers of high-modulus unidirectional pre-preg material with radiation tolerant and low CME cyanate ester resins together with a copper/kapton/aluminium bus tape. The carbon-fibre mechanical requirements are dictated by the overall stiffness requirements for a particular stave geometry and mounting strategy and the thermal requirements are constrained by their use, in combination with the detector module silicon substrates to conduct the heat generated within the module to the cooling structures embedded in the core. However, the advent of lower-power 130nm FE ASICs and a better understanding of the thermal design and safety margins has allowed greater freedom in specifying the preferred pre-preg for ease of fabrication and cost considerations.

Different techniques have been used to integrate the bus-tape with the carbon-fibre to form the final face sheet with the most promising being the co-curing of the tape with carbon-fibre pre-preg and the room temperature lamination of the tape to a cured carbon-fibre laminate. The former approach eliminates the mass associated with the glue layer in the latter at the expense of higher internal stresses due to the elevated temperature used in co-curing. Experience has shown that pre-pregs with lower temperature curing resins and higher resin contents yield the best co-cured facesheet whereas good results for room temperature lamination has been demonstrated with pre-pregs with much lower resin content. In a sense, the need for extra resin in the pre-preg to enable co-curing to work properly offsets the extra material associated with the extra adhesive layer needed for room-temperature lamination. If relatively thick, high carbon-fibre content face sheets are needed for structural or thermal reasons then room temperature lamination on a pre-cured, low resin content pre-preg is competitive. If, however, the structural requirements can be satisfied with face sheets with rather less carbon-fibre then co-curing results in the lowest overall polymer mass.

#### 2.2.2 Cooling Structure

Heat is removed from the stave by boiling heat transfer in a small bore tube filled with CO\({}_{2}\) evaporating at a low temperature (typically -35\({}^{\circ}\)C). As staves have all their services connections at the Z=1.2m end, the tube passes along the length of the stave and returns back again via a 'U'-bend close to Z=0. Using both the flow and return arms maximises the area available for heat transfer into the fluid and hence the tubes are located \(\pm\) 25mm from the centre-line of the stave such that heat flow from the module is divided into four sections of equal length and heat flux. In order to ensure that the structure is balanced with respect to thermally induced stresses, the cooling tubes are located in the mid-plane of the stave. The interface between the tube and the face sheet is formed using a thermally conducting carbon foam and glue joints using an adhesive loaded with a thermally conducting material. The geometry and material for the cooling tube is determined by the need to have a sufficient flow for extracting the heat generated in the FE ASICs and silicon wafer whilst minimising the radiation-length contribution consistent with the need to manufacture circuits with high yield and robustness. We believe that the thermal and mechanical stave specifications can be met using titanium tubes with an inner diameter of about 2mm and a wall thickness of about 0.12mm.

#### 2.2.3 Low-density core material

Apart from the cooling structures and the close-outs, the remainder of the central portion of the stave core is filled with a low density core material which is glued to the two face sheets. The requirements of the low density core material are that it adequately supports the face sheets to maintain their separation for good bending stiffness and to ensure the stave has a sufficiently flat and robust surface to allow adhesive attachment of the modules without the need for excessively thick glue layers. Typically such core materials might be honeycombs or low density carbon foam with effective densities of <0.05kg.m\({}^{-3}\). In addition, custom core geometries (eg. corrugations) have been studied. Critical to the choice of core material is the efficiency of glue usage in attaching the face sheets to the core. Fundamental to the attainment of the best bending stiffness, and therefore most efficient use of material, is theability of the facesheet - core interface to carry shear stresses and therefore the optimum choice of core material is that which optimises the overall stave mechanical performance versus mass.

#### 2.2.4 Close-outs

The stave edges are enclosed by end and side close-outs. End closeouts, normally made of engineering plastics, are used to mitigate against possible de-lamination of the core during handling in general and, in particular, against the effects of extraneous forces applied to the cooling tubes. Meanwhile, carbon-fibre side close-outs are used to form part of the mechanical interface to the global support structures and function as guide rails during stave insertion. The functional and mechanical properties of staves using both circular and 'C'-channel shaped side close-outs have been studied. The mass associated with the edge close-outs is relatively small and the exact geometry has little impact on the stave core properties or assembly complexity, however, the precise design is intimately coupled to the mechanical interfaces to the support structures and the stave insertion process.

#### 2.2.5 Mechanical Interface to the Global Support Structure

The primary purpose of the mechanical interface between the stave and the global support structure is to define the position of a stave, and therefore by extension the modules, in 3D space within the tracker. There are two aspects of positioning which are significant; the first being the as-assembled position and the second being the stability with which the actual position of the stave and modules is maintained during operation. The as-assembled tolerances are relatively relaxed being defined by second-order considerations such as insertion clearances, services connections etc whilst the stability requirements need to be much more stringent to ensure minimal impact on physics.

In practical terms the mechanical interfaces take the form of a number of on-cylinder mounting brackets which interface to features related to the stave side close-outs and define the position in r-phi of one edge of a stave and its angle to the radial direction. Further components are used to define the z-position with the current working assumption being that this is best done at z=1.3m where the services are connected.

There are two candidates for the design of the mechanical interface which differ only in the manner in which the angular orientation of a stave relative to the radial direction is defined at intermediate points along its length. In one solution this is achieved using a mounting bracket design which holds the stave (with a circular side close-out) at several points along its length whilst the other solution uses a mounting bracket with an angular constraint which holds the stave via an insert into a 'C'-channel close-out at several points along the side of the stave closest to the cylinder.

### End of Stave Region

The electrical and optical interface between the stave and the external services will be situated on a small End-Of-Stave PCB located at the Z=1.3m end on the larger radius edge of the stave. The EOS will be contain the electro-optical transceivers, and associated GBT ASICs to receive clock, trigger and command signals and distribute them to the modules and to collect and re-format the data for transmission. In addition the EOS will also contain the LV and HV interfaces terminated in a short pig-tail which will be mounted onto the cylinder interlinks for strain relief. The electrical connection between the stave bus tape and the EOS card will be via wire bonding.

### Thermal Stability

Thermal runaway will occur if the sensor generated heat (which increases rapidly with temperature) is not balanced by its removal to the coolant. Stable operation depends on a combination of sufficiently low coolant temperature, thermal path resistance and sensor power (which grows with radiation damage). We use detailed FEA models of the stave to predict temperature distributions and safety margins (headroom). Figure 2, illustrates the problem in the case of a thermal circuit with simple geometry; the analytic solutions to this case are useful in extending the FEA analysis [1]. In stable operation (point O) the heat generated by the sensor is removed by conduction. Runaway will occur if for instance the level of sensor generation is increased above the dashed curve, or the sink temperature is raised above T0\({}_{\text{crit}}\).

We are particularly concerned with runaway headroom at the end of detector operation. To properly simulate this configuration we need to understand the predicted fluence, the sensor power, the temperature dependence of the leakage current, the thermal path between the module and the coolant and the power dissipated in the front-end electronics.

#### 2.5.1 Maximum Radiation Fluence

Radiation in the ATLAS detector has been modelled by Dawson et al [14] using FLUKA, to predict the fluence distribution in the radial and axial coordinates, expressed in terms of the equivalent flux of 1MeV neutrons (neq). Assuming 3000fb-1, 84.5mb and 14 TeV c.o.m. energy, the maximum fluence within the strip detectors is predicted to be 6.0x10-1, located at the extremities of the inner barrel (R = 38cm, \(|\)Z\(|\) = 117cm). For safety, _we apply a factor_ x2 to this model prediction, so that in the following we assume a maximum fluence of 1.2x10-1, neq/cm2.

#### 2.5.2 Sensor Power

The power dissipated by the sensor is given by the product of bias voltage and the (temperature dependent) leakage current. We assume a maximum practical value for the bias voltage of 500V. This is insufficient to fully deplete the

rise. The baseline model is of a representative section of stave with one module per face, or a smaller section based on its approximate symmetry. Thermal conductivity values and material thicknesses used in the FEA are summarised in Table 1 and are based largely on the results (as of end 2010) of the materials studies described in section **Errorl Reference source not found.**. The conductivity of the multi-layer readout hybrid (which is not directly on the sensor cooling path) is approximated by average values derived from a sub-model. The contribution of the honeycomb core is not expected to be large and is approximated by air until it is better understood.

The evaporative CO\({}_{2}\) heat transfer coefficient (htc) varies considerably with vapour quality and power density: by default we assume 8000W/m\({}^{2}\)K, which is close to the low end of its expected range.

Figure 3: FEA Models: (a) ANSYS 1/4 module with total electronics power shared by FE ASICs. (b) ABAQUS full module including explicit DCDC converter and HCC ASIC.

Simulation of the sensor leakage power according to equations [1 and 2] is not directly available within the FEA packages: it is instead emulated by applying a fixed potential difference across the sensor thickness and specifying the appropriate temperature dependent electrical conductivity. The baseline models neglect ambient thermal loads due to convection and radiation (which we consider later).

#### 2.5.7 Baseline Thermal Runaway Predictions

Results for the ABAQUS simulation (in the serially powered configuration) are plotted in Figure 4. The left hand plot depicts the variation of mean sensor temperature with q(0*C) (which grows with radiation fluence) with the coolant temperature fixed at -30*C. The right hand plot corresponds to q(0*C) fixed at its maximum value (after maximum fluence) and shows the relative rise of mean sensor temperature as the coolant temperature is varied.

The FEA results for the power q(0*C) at runaway, assuming a coolant temperature of -30*C are (in units of mW/mm\({}^{2}\)):

\[\text{Serial Powering: }6.0-6.1\text{ (ANSYS), }6.16\text{ (ABAQUS); }\quad\text{DCDC Powering: }6.07\text{ (ABAQUS).}\]

Hence the predicted runaway power is 6.1mW/mm\({}^{2}\) at 0*C within \(\pm\) 2%. Moreover (allowing for rounding differences in the input power) we find negligible dependence on the powering scheme. The DCDC convertor injects heat at the edge of the stave (distant from the cooling pipes) which causes some asymmetry in the sensor temperature distribution, however it is mounted directly on the stave core and has a similar effect on the mean sensor temperature as SP conversion within the ASICs. Additional FEA studies indicate that the runaway power is insensitive to the precise location of the readout hybrids (which may be optimised to satisfy assembly or electrical constraints).

In terms of the expected final power of 0.65 mW/mm\({}^{2}\) (0*C) the FEA predictions represent a headroom factor of *9.4, which is far larger than the uncertainty in predicted radiation fluence (or the design headroom factor for the existing ATLAS SCT). The more relevant variable is likely to be the coolant temperature, which for runaway would have to rise to -8.5*C (Figure 4b). This represents a headroom of 21.5*C with respect to a coolant temperature of -30*C (or essentially 26.5*C for a coolant temperature of -35*C). We note that these results are consistent with the analytic predictions that the power headroom is halved for an increase in coolant temperature of about 6.5*C and that the maximum rise in stable sensor temperature due to leakage current is close to 10*C [B&V 2010].

#### 2.5.8 Variations on the Baseline Model

It is useful to investigate the sensitivity of headroom to changes in the input parameters, for instance to reflect a revised estimate of hybrid power, to assess the level of production QA required (for instance the conductivities of facing material and graphite foam) and to identify those components where thermal conductance might be sacrificed

Figure 4: FEA results (red points) for the mean sensor temperature (a) as a function of q(0*C) with the coolant at -30*C; (b) relative to the coolant temperature, with q(0*C) fixed at 0.65mw/mm\({}^{2}\), The curves are analytic predictions as described in the text.

in favour of reduced mass. For these studies we note that FEA iteration to find the runaway point (where the rate of sensor temperature rise becomes infinite) is inefficient and prone to error: we therefore make use of the analytic formulae, as follows. The FEA is first run with the electronics heat load alone and the effective thermal resistance between sensor and coolant found from \(R_{c}=\) (mean sensor T rise) / hybrid power. A small sensor leakage power (typically 0.02mW/mm\({}^{2}\) at 0\({}^{\circ}\)C) is then added to find the effective resistance, \(R_{t}\), for sensor generated heat. In the case of the the baseline FEA we find \(R_{c}=\) 0.85, \(R_{t}=\) 0.90 [\({}^{\circ}\)C/W]. The resultant analytic curves are shown in Figure 4 and clearly reproduce the FEA results well, predicting runaway at q(0\({}^{\circ}\)C) = 6.2mW/mm\({}^{2}\) (for T\({}_{c}\)=-30\({}^{\circ}\)C) or T\({}_{c}\) = -8.3\({}^{\circ}\)C (at maximum fluence). We expect this method to be accurate provided that the temperature variation across the sensor is not too large.

Some approximate predictions can be made without further recourse to FEA (neglecting the temperature dependence of thermal conductivity). In the absence of leakage power the mean sensor temperature rise is proportional to the hybrid power and for the baseline design is given by \(R_{c}{}^{\circ}Q_{hybrid}=\)5\({}^{\circ}\)C. Recently updated estimates of hybrid power suggest that it may be 20% higher than the values assumed above, which would contribute a further one degree rise: this is equivalent to the same rise in coolant temperature, so represents a one degree loss of headroom. Similarly, if the hybrid power were doubled (e.g. if required for trigger processing) the headroom would be reduced by a further 5-6 degrees (which would be tolerable). The effect of varying the fluid htc or cooling pipe diameter can be estimated quite accurately since the thermal flux is nearly radial at the cooling pipe, so that the thermal resistance can be adjusted and the revised runaway points computed from the analytic formulae: increasing the pipe internal diameter from 2mm to 3mm for example raises the predicted headroom by close to one degree.

For most material variations it is necessary to run the two-point FEA. Figure 5 summarises the effect on coolant temperature headroom of halving individual thermal conductivity values (where this effect exceeds half a degree) and the combination of all effects - shown in the green bars. Since hybrid and sensor heat follow a similar path through the stave there is a close (although not unique) correspondence with the power headroom factor, which is shown above the plot and is accurate to within a few percent. The pink bar shows the result of reducing the sensor glue conductivity from its baseline value of 2.0 W/m-K. (Results based on Serial Powering model).

Figure 5: Runaway headroom vs. component thermal conductivity for T[coolant_=-30\({}^{\circ}\)C and final sensor power of 0.65 mw/mm\({}^{2}\) at 0\({}^{\circ}\)C.

No single component dominates: the fluid htc is the most influential and the glue between the cooling pipe and surrounding foam is also important, due to the high thermal flux density close to the pipe. Conduction across the width of the stave is sensitive to the CFRP facing conductivity (K\({}_{x}\)), but not excessively so, since the sensor contributes even higher conductance (in parallel) and the lateral thermal path length is minimised by the cooling pipe arrangement. The choice of glue used to bond the sensor to the stave is under study and the effect of reducing its conductivity is shown in the figure.

#### 2.5.9 Performance at the Stave Extremities

The baseline FEA model does not accurately describe the structure at the ends of the stave. Near Z=0 (the barrel centre) the thermal path is modified by the cooling pipe U-bend. In order to maintain thermal performance the foam coupling between the cooling pipe and CFRP facings will extend across the entire U-bend. At the barrel extremity there is an additional thermal load due to power dissipated by the end of stave card. Assuming the current version of GBT and Versatile Link, this will amount to ~3W per face (comparable to half the readout hybrid power). In the baseline design the card is mounted on the side of the stave, and its heat removed by a dedicated meander of the cooling pipe, which is hydraulically undesirable. FEA studies of pipe geometry and conductive foam reinforcement are in progress, to optimise the design with respect to component temperatures and thermal runaway.
