The ATLAS Collaboration

###### Abstract

Modeling of the fragmentation and decay of heavy flavor hadrons is compared for four Monte Carlo generators: Pythia8, Pythia6, Herwig++ and Herwig. Heavy flavor hadron production fractions and fragmentation functions are studied using top-quark pair and high transverse momentum jet samples generated for \(pp\) collisions at \(\sqrt{s}=8\) TeV. The performance of the generators for heavy flavor fragmentation is also validated using \(e^{+}e^{-}\) annihilation events generated at \(\sqrt{s}=91.2\) GeV (for \(b\)-quarks) and \(\sqrt{s}=10.53\) GeV (for \(c\)-quarks). In addition, bottom and charm hadron decays for the four generators are compared both to results with EvtGen Monte Carlo model and to experimental measurements.

Introduction

Final states that include heavy flavor (bottom and charm) hadrons are important for the study of many processes at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). Examples of such processes include top quark pair (\(t\bar{t}\)) production, Higgs production (with decay to a bottom quark pair) and searches for signals from physics beyond the Standard Model (SM). To fully exploit the large data samples that will be collected during Run II at the LHC, a reduction in current systematic uncertainties associated with the modeling of heavy flavor hadron production and decay will be needed. Although data-driven methods are likely to play a major part in the effort to reduce these uncertainties, improvementsin the Monte Carlo (MC) models used to determine reconstruction efficiencies will also be necessary.

An overview of the physics of general purpose MC event generators can be found in reviews such as References [1] and [2]. Simulation of QCD processes using these generators involves four separate stages. First, the short distance cross section for the process of interest is calculated from the hard-scattering matrix elements obtained using a fixed-order perturbative QCD calculation. Second, perturbative contributions from initial- and final-state parton showers are included. These stages together provide a descripiton of the kinematic properties of quarks, gluons and leptons. Third, soft hadronic phenomena are treated using QCD-inspired models. In this step, the quarks and gluons are transformed into colorless objects using a hadronization model which includes the effects of fragmentation and soft gluon radiation. The most common hadronization models are the string model (used by Pythia6[3] and Pythia8[4]) and the cluster model (used by Herwig[5] and Herwig++[6]). For hadronic initial states, the underlying event and effects from multiple parton interactions are incorporated at this stage. The generators all include adjustable phenomenological parameters that are determined by comparing MC predictions to experimental data. Differences in the treatment of the soft physics and in the values chosen for the adjustable parameters can lead to substantial variations in the kinematic properties of the particles produced (see, for example, the results compiled in Reference [7]). Fourth, hadron and \(\tau\) decays proceed according to particle tables that have been adapted from experimental data.

This note presents a study of heavy flavor hadron production and decay properties for four MC generators (Pythia8, Pythia6, Herwig++ and Herwig) extensively used to model \(pp\) interactions at the LHC. Two benchmark physics processes are used for these comparisons: \(t\bar{t}\) production, in which a \(b\)-quark is produced in each top decay and a \(c\)-quark is produced in approximately 1/3 of the \(W\) decays 1 and high transverse momentum (\(p_{\rm T}\)) jet production, in which the generators produce \(b\)- and \(c\)-quarks via both the matrix element calculation and the parton shower. In addition, ancillary \(e^{+}e^{-}\to b\overline{b}\) and \(e^{+}e^{-}\to c\overline{c}\) samples are generated using shower parameterizations consistent with those used for LHC tunes. These samples are used to check the consistency of the fragmentation functions with data for the processes in which the fragmentation functions were originally measured.

Footnote 1: Although bottom and charm hadrons can also be produced in the parton shower, the rate for such production is small when compared to that produced in the top decays.

The note is organized as follows. Section 2 provides information on the configuration of the MC generators used for these studies. Section 3 presents the bottom and charm hadron production fractions obtained with these generators and compares them to world averages of experimental data. These production fractions are sensitive to the adjustable parameters of the hadronization model. Section 4 provides a detailed study of the modeling of heavy quark fragmentation. The MC generators all rely on the assumption that non-perturbative fragmentation functions are universal (aside from the QCD scaling violations). Section 5 compares decay properties of heavy flavor hadrons in each of the four generators to world average experimental data. In addition, these results are compared to those obtained with the EvtGen [8] decay package, which implements detailed models of flavor decay and uses branching fraction measurements compiled in Reference [9]. Section 6 provides a brief summary of the results presented here.

Monte Carlo Samples

The versions of the four generators studied here are Pythia 6.427, Pythia 8.175, Herwig 6.520 with Jimmy 4.31 [10] for the underlying event and Herwig++ 2.6.3a. All \(pp\) samples have been generated with a center-of-mass energy of \(\sqrt{s}=8\) TeV.

Two physics processes are studied:

* Top-pair production (\(t\bar{t}\)) is calculated using Powheg[11, 12, 13, 14] r2330 and the CT10 [15] parton distribution functions (PDFs). At least one of the \(W\) bosons in the \(t\bar{t}\) event is required to decay leptonically. The output of Powheg are files in Les Houches Event (LHE) format, which contain the top-pair decay products (leptons and quarks). The same Powheg LHE files are then passed to each of the four generators for parton shower, hadronization and underlying-event modeling. The generator tunes used are Perugia 2011C [16] (Pythia6), AU2(CT10) [17] (Pythia8) 2, AUET2(CT10) [18] (J Jimmy) and UE-EE-4-LO**[19] (Herwig++). In Pythia6 and Pythia8, heavy quark fragmentation uses the Lund symmetric model with the Bowler modification [20]. In Herwig and Herwig++, heavy quarks are fragmented using the cluster model. Footnote 2: While the default release of Pythia 8.175 uses the tau lifetimes specified in the Powheg LHE files, a patch was applied to overrule the incorrect lifetimes written out in the Powheg event record. This patch has since become part of Pythia 8.175.
* High \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) jet samples are generated using the matrix element calculations provided by each generator. The generator tunes and fragmentation models used are the same as those used for the \(t\bar{t}\) samples. Events are required to have at least one jet with \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) between 500 GeV and 1 TeV.

For both processes, jets are reconstructed from stable particles 3 using the infrared- and collinear-safe anti-\(k_{t}\) algorithm [21] with radius parameter \(R=0.4\) using the FastJet package [22]. In the case of \(t\bar{t}\) samples, leptons from the W decay are excluded from the jet reconstruction.

Footnote 3: Stable particles are defined as those with a mean lifetime, \(c\tau_{0}\), \(<10\) mm.

For the fragmentation studies in Section 4, \(e^{+}e^{-}\) samples are generated. Unless otherwise stated, these samples are generated with initial state QED radiation enabled. Comparisons with LEP and SLC data use \(e^{+}e^{-}\to b\overline{b}\) samples generated at \(\sqrt{s}=91.2\) GeV. In addition, \(e^{+}e^{-}\to b\overline{b}\) samples generated at \(\sqrt{s}=200\) GeV with initial state QED disabled for comparison to the \(\sqrt{s}=91.2\) GeV samples. Comparisons with Belle and CLEO data are studied using \(e^{+}e^{-}\to c\overline{c}\) samples with \(\sqrt{s}=10.53\) GeV.

For studies of bottom and charm hadron decay properties, EvtGen 2.0 [8] is used. Decay products of all heavy flavor hadrons are removed from the event record and the four-momenta of the heavy flavor hadrons are passed to EvtGen, which rec decays these hadrons; these new decay products are added to the event record. In some cases, modifications to the EvtGen default decay table have been made. These changes are discussed in Section 5.

## 3 Heavy Flavor Hadron Production Fractions

The relative rates for production of different heavy flavor species depend on each generator's choice of hadronization model and the values of the tunable parameters of that model. These production fractions have been studied for weakly decaying bottom and charm hadrons in both the \(t\bar{t}\) and the high \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) jet samples. Results for the \(t\bar{t}\) are shown here; the difference between production fractions in the two processes is less than 0.006.

Figure 1 compares the production fractions for weakly decaying bottom and charm hadrons:

\[B^{0}\ B^{+}\ B^{0}_{s}\ B^{+}_{c}\ \Lambda^{0}_{b}\ \Xi^{-}_{b}\ \Xi^{0}_{b}\ \Omega_{b}\ D^{+}\ D^{0}\ D^{+}_{s}\ \Lambda^{+}_{c}\ \Xi^{+}_{c}\ \Xi^{0}_{c}\ \Omega^{0}_{c}\]and their charge conjugates for the four generators. Charm hadron production fractions include only those hadrons produced directly (not from bottom hadron decays). Although the \(\Sigma_{B}\) should not decay weakly, Herwig erroneously decays them weakly under some conditions; these decays are shown on the plot.

Recent results from LHCb constrain the ratio of \(B_{s}\) production to \(B^{0}\) production to be \(f_{s}/f_{d}=0.259\pm 0.015\)[23], with no evidence of dependence on the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) or \(\eta\) of the hadrons. However, the baryon fraction in the forward region is observed to depend significantly on the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) and \(\eta\) of the hadron [24]. Thus, results from LHCb are of limited use in constraining baryon production at central rapidities. The PDG [9] provides values for the bottom hadron production fractions at high energy, using results obtained from \(Z\) decays and central \(p\overline{p}\) collisions, under the assumption that these fractions should be universal aside from forward, leading-particle effects in hadron collisions. Fractions obtained from the four generators are compared to the PDG values in Table 1. All the generators are in reasonable agreement with the data, although the baryon fraction in Pythia8 is low.

For the case of charm hadrons, the experimental data have been compiled and averaged, including a careful treatment of correlated systematic uncertainties in Reference [25]. Results for the different generators are compared to these averages in Table 2. In general, the generators overestimate the \(D^{+}\) fraction. The \(D^{0}\) fraction in Herwig is significantly lower than the fraction in the data and other three generators. Charm baryon fractions are poorly constrained by the data and vary widely among the generators.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|r|r|r|r|r|r|} \hline Species & Pythia8 & Pythia6 & Herwig++ & Herwig & World Average [9] \\ \hline \(B^{+}\) & 43.2 & 42.1 & 40.9 & 39.1 & 40.2 \(\pm\) 0.7 \\ \(B^{0}\) & 43.2 & 42.2 & 40.9 & 39.1 & 40.2 \(\pm\) 0.7 \\ \(B^{0}_{s}\) & 8.4 & 8.2 & 9.5 & 10.1 & 10.4 \(\pm\) 0.6 \\ Baryons & 5.1 & 7.3 & 8.6 & 11.7 & 9.3 \(\pm\) 1.5 \\ \hline \end{tabular}

## 4 Heavy Flavor Fragmentation

The fragmentation of a \(b\)- or \(c\)-quark into a heavy flavor hadron is modeled by the generators using a non-perturbative fragmentation function \(D_{Q}^{H}(z,\mu^{2})\) that describes the probability that a quark of species \(Q\) will fragment into a hadron of species \(\bar{H}\) carrying fraction \(z\) of the quark's momentum [9]. As with parton distribution functions, the fragmentation functions exhibit scaling violations and therefore must be evaluated at an appropriate scale \(\mu\). These fragmentation functions are assumed to be universal, aside from the scale dependence, which can be calculated perturbatively. Modeling of the fragmentation functions differs among the generators, but in all cases the parameters of the models have been tuned using data from \(e^{+}e^{-}\) collisions.

To assess the performance of the four generators, the following strategy is used. First, \(e^{+}e^{-}\to b\overline{b}\) and \(e^{+}e^{-}\to c\overline{c}\) samples are generated at the center-of-mass energy of the most accurate experimental measurements, using shower parametrizations consistent with those used for the LHC tunes. These samples are used to validate the modeling of the non-perturbative heavy flavor fragmentation functions. Second, the evolution of fragmentation functions is studied by comparing these samples with \(e^{+}e^{-}\to b\overline{b}\) and \(e^{+}e^{-}\to c\overline{c}\) events generated at \(\sqrt{s}=200\) GeV. Third, the fragmentation is studied for each of the generators in the process \(pp\to t\overline{t}\), in which the production of \(b\)- and \(c\)-jets are predominantly produced from the \(t\overline{t}\) hard scatter. Finally, to study the case where heavy flavor is produced both in the hard scatter and in the parton shower, samples of high \(p_{\rm T}\) jets are analyzed.

Data on \(b\)-quark fragmentation are available from LEP and SLC. The measurements parametrize the fragmentation function as a function of \(x\equiv E/E_{\rm\ beam}\) where \(E\) is the energy of the bottom hadron. Figure 2 (a) compares the distribution

\[F(x)\equiv\frac{1}{N_{B}}\frac{dN_{B}}{dx}\]

for the four generators to measurements from DELPHI [26] and SLD [27]. The mean values of these distributions are given in Table 3. To better match the experimental requirements on these measurements, events in the MC samples are required to satisfy the criteria that \(|\cos\theta_{\rm\ thrust}|<0.7\)4 and that the number of weakly decaying bottom hadrons (\(N_{B}\)) satisfy \(0<N_{B}<3\). The mean value of \(x\) in the MC samples varies from \(0.6782\pm 0.0005\) (Herwig) to \(0.7303\pm 0.0005\) (Pythia8). Pythia6 and Herwig++ agree well with the data, while Pythia8 is high by \(\sim 2\%\) and Herwig is low by \(\sim 3\%\). These results are consistent with those presented in Reference [7].

Footnote 4: The thrust axis is defined as the axis \({\bf n}\) that maximizes the value of \(\sum\limits_{i}{\bf n}\cdot{\bf p}/\sum\limits_{i}{\bf p}_{i}\), where the sum is taken over all stable particles in the event.

Figure 2 (b) shows the same distribution for the four generators at a center-of-mass energy of \(\sqrt{s}=200\) GeV. The samples are generated without initial state QED in order to isolate the effect of increased \(\sqrt{s}\). As expected, the mean value of \(x\) is lower than at the \(Z\)-pole, due the evolution of the fragmentation

\begin{tabular}{|r|r|r|r|r|r|} \hline Species & Pythia8 & Pythia6 & Herwig++ & Herwig & Reference [25] \\ \hline \(D^{+}\) & 28.3 & 26.8 & 26.7 & 24.3 & \(22.56\pm 0.77\) \\ \(D^{0}\) & 58.1 & 57.7 & 58.1 & 50.3 & \(56.43\pm 1.51\) \\ \(D_{s}\) & 8.5 & 8.2 & 7.7 & 9.2 & \(7.97\pm 0.45\) \\ Baryons & 5.1 & 7.2 & 7.6 & 16.2 & \(10.8\pm 0.91\) \\ \hline \end{tabular}

function. The ratio of the means at the higher energy to those at the lower energy are 93.8%, 95.8%, 94.0% and 97.2% for Pythia8, Pythia9, Herwig++ and Herwig respectively.

Studies of \(c\)-quark fragmentation are available from Belle [28] and CLEO [29]. The fragmentation function is measured as a function of \(x_{p}\equiv p/p_{\rm\ max}\) where \(p\) is the momentum of the charm hadron and \(p_{\rm\ max}\) is the maximum momentum that is kinematically allowed. Charm hadrons are required to be directly produced; bottom hadron decay products are excluded. Figures 3 (a) and 3 (b) compare the four generators to the experimental measurements for \(D^{+}\) and \(D^{0}\) mesons respectively. Table 4 gives the mean value of the fragmentation functions. The Pythia8 fragmentation appears to be significantly harder than the data, while other generators agree reasonably well with the data and with each other.

In \(e^{+}e^{-}\) collisions, the fragmentation function can be measured relative to the beam energy, since the momentum transfer of the hard scatter is fixed by the energy of the initial beams (aside from initial state photon radiation). However, fragmentation in hadron collisions must be parameterized with respect to the output of a jet-finding algorithm. By convention, the \(p_{\rm T}\) of the jet containing the heavy flavor hadron is used to approximate the unknown \(p_{\rm T}\) of the heavy flavor parton. The resulting fragmentation function \(f(z)\) is defined to be

\[f(z)\equiv\frac{\vec{p}_{\rm\ hadron}\cdot\vec{p}_{\rm\ jet}}{p^{2}_{\rm\ jet}}.\]

For this study, the \(f(z)\) is measured for anti-\(k_{t}(R=0.4)\) jets with \(|\eta^{\rm\ Jet}|<2.5\). Jets are defined to be heavy flavor jets if there is a weakly decaying heavy flavor hadron with \(p_{\rm T}>5\) GeV within \(\Delta R=\sqrt{\Delta\phi^{2}+\Delta\eta^{2}}<0.3\) of the jet direction. For measurements of the charm fragmentation function, jets are vetoed if the charm hadron contained in the jet is a bottom hadron decay product.

For large momentum scale processes, an additional perturbative contribution (from \(g\to b\overline{b}\)) becomes significant. In some cases, this perturbative component is explicitly included in the matrix element calculation, while in other cases this component is treated as part of the parton shower. Such jets are included here in the definition of \(b\)- and \(c\)- jets.

Figure 4 and Table 5 show the bottom and charm fragmentation functions \(f(z)\) for jets in the \(t\bar{t}\) samples satisfying the requirement \(p_{T}^{\rm\ Jet}>25\) GeV in events containing a lepton with \(p_{T}^{\rm\ Jet}>20\) GeV and \(|\eta^{\rm\ Jet}|<2.5\). The mean value of \(z\) varies from 0.741 (Herwig) to 0.772 (Herwig++) for \(b\)-quarks and from 0.552 (Pythia6) to 0.575 (Herwig) for \(c\)-quarks. The \(b\)-quark (\(c\)-quark) fragmentation in Herwig++ (Herwig) is noticeably harder than for the other generators.

The fragmentation function in jets is sensitive to many other aspects of the simulation. Measurements depend on the choice of jet algorithm and can be affected by the underlying event tune, as well as by the transverse shape of the generated jet. Details of the shower modeling itself, such as the suppression of QCD radiation from heavy particles (the _dead-cone_ effect [30]) can also play a role. To better study the fragmentation model, these effects are probed using additional distributions for these heavy flavor jets. Figure 5 shows the width of the \(b\)-quark and \(c\)-quark jets, where the jet width (\(W\)) is obtained from the \(p_{\rm T}\) weighted distribution of the distance \(\Delta R\) from the center of the jet:

\[W\equiv\frac{\sum_{i}p_{T_{i}}\,\Delta R_{i}}{\sum_{i}p_{T_{i}}}\]

and the sum is taken over all stable particles that are constituents of the jets. The mean value of the jet widths for all generators agree to within a few percent, although the distribution of widths for \(b\)-quark jets is slightly broader for Pythia8 than for the other generators and the distribution of widths for \(c\)-quarks is slightly narrower for Herwig and Herwig++ than for Pythia6 and Pythia8.

Here \(\Delta r=0.04\) is the width of the annulus, \(r\), such that \(\Delta r/2\leq r\leq R-\Delta r/2\) is the distance to the jet axis in the \(\eta-\phi\) plane and \(p_{T}(r_{1},r_{2})\) is the scalar sum of the \(p_{T}\) of the jet constituents with radii between \(r_{1}\) and \(r_{2}\). Figure 6 shows the distribution of the variable \(\rho(r)\). ATLAS results for \(t\bar{t}\) production at 7 TeV indicate that Powheg with Pythia6 for the parton shower give good agreement with the data for this variable [31]. No experimental results are currently available at 8 TeV.

The integrated jet shape in a cone of radius \(r<R\) around the jet axis is defined as the cumulative distribution for \(\rho(r)\), i.e.

\[\Psi(r)\equiv\frac{p_{T}\left(0,r\right)}{p_{T}\left(0,R\right)},\ 0\leq r\leq R\]

which satisfies \(\Psi(r=R)=1\). Figure 7 shows the distribution of \(\Psi(r)\). For each of these jet shapes, differences between the generators are small. The fact that Herwig++ (Herwig) \(b\)-quark (\(c\)-quark) fragmentation is harder than for the other generators is not clearly explained by differences in the the \(W,\rho(r)\) or \(\Psi(r)\) distributions.

Figure 8 shows the jet \(p_{\rm T}\) distribution for \(b\)- and \(c\)-jets in the \(t\bar{t}\) samples. For \(b\)-jets, the generators are in reasonable agreement, except for Herwig++, which exhibits a slightly softer spectrum. All generators agree well for \(c\)-jets. Figure 9 shows the \(p_{\rm T}\) distributions of the bottom and charm hadrons contained in these jets. Herwig++ produces a slightly softer \(p_{\rm T}\) spectrum for the bottom hadrons, while Herwig has a softer spectrum for charm hadrons.

For high \(p_{\rm T}\) jets, the \(f(z)\) distribution has two components. The fragmentation of heavy flavor created in the hard scatter produces a distribution at higher \(z\). The production of heavy flavor in additional processes gives a component at lower \(z\). Examples of such processes include gluon splitting, multiple parton interactions and heavy flavor production within the hadronization process. These components have been studied for jets with \(p_{T}^{\,\rm jet}\) between 500 GeV and 1 TeV. Figures 10 (a) and 10 (b) show the distribution of \(f(z)\) for the four generators for \(b\)- and \(c\)-jets respectively. The dominant feature in these distributions is a large peak at low \(z\), although this peak is less pronounced for Herwig and Herwig++ than for Pythia6 and Pythia8. To enhance the high \(z\) contribution from the hard scatter, the distributions are examined in Figures 10 (c) and (d) for the subset of \(b\)- and \(c\)-jets satisfying an additional requirement that there be no other weakly decaying heavy flavor hadron with \(p_{T}^{\,\rm hadron}>5.0\) GeV within a cone \(\Delta R=1\) of the jet. While some evidence of the low \(z\) peaking still remains, the distributions for \(z>0.2\) in Figures 10 (c) and (d) are qualitatively similar to those of Figures 4 (a) and (b) respectively.

## 5 Heavy Flavor Hadron Decays

Heavy flavor decay properties are studied for different Monte Carlo generators. All weakly decaying bottom and charm hadrons (listed in Section 3) were selected from inclusive \(t\bar{t}\) events and their decays were then analyzed.

Pythia8, Pythia6, Herwig++ and Herwig each maintain separate particle properties and particle decay tables. Therefore, the generated lifetimes, semileptonic branching fractions and charged multiplicities for heavy flavor hadrons differ among the generators. Such differences can affect the \(b\)-tagging efficiency and the mistag rate for charm hadrons passing the b-tagger in simulated data. An alternative approach is to redecay all heavy flavor hadrons using a unified decay description. This approach has been studied by using EvtGen to redecay all heavy flavor hadrons produced for each of the four generators. Results are presented here for each generator both with and without EvtGen.

EvtGen version 2.0 is used with the particle properties table provided with the EvtGen release and its standard inclusive decay table DECAY_2010.DEC. In some cases, the data in these standard tables differ from the values reported by the PDG. These differences are highlighted in the figures that follow and a proposed update to the decay table is provided.

Figure 11 and Figure 12 compare the lifetimes of four weakly decaying bottom (\(B^{0}\), \(B^{+}\), \(B^{0}_{s}\)  and \(\Lambda_{b}\)) and charm hadrons (\(D^{0}\), \(D^{+}\), \(D_{s}\)  and \(\Lambda_{c}\)) respectively for the four generators and for EvtGen. Using EvtGen improves the agreement of lifetimes with the experimental averages in the PDG. The value of the \(B^{0}_{s}\) lifetime in the default EvtGen particle properties table differs from the world average listed by the PDG.

Figure 13 and Figure 14 show the semileptonic branching fractions for the same bottom and charm hadrons. These figures demonstrate that the branching fractions in the default EvtGen particle properties table differ from the world averages listed by the PDG. In order to improve agreement with the PDG semileptonic branching fractions, a custom decay table was updated for ATLAS, rescaling the semileptonic modes so that the inclusive semileptonic fraction matched that in the PDG. The results from the two decays tables are shown in Figure 13 and Figure 14 for comparison.

Table 7 and Figures 15-16 show the charged multiplicity distributions for these bottom hadrons and charm hadrons while Table 8 and Figures 17-18 show the total (charged plus neutral) multiplicity. Here a stable particle is defined as a particle with a proper lifetime \(c\tau_{0}>10\) mm so that, for example, the \(K_{S}\) is considered stable, but the \(\pi^{0}\) is allowed to decay. The multiplicities vary between generators by as much as \(\sim 20\%\) for bottom hadrons and as much as \(\sim 15\%\) for charm hadrons.

Summary

Studies of heavy flavor production fractions, fragmentation functions and decay properties for four MC generators are presented. Bottom production fractions vary among generators, largely due to large differences of up to 6.5% in the baryon fraction. For charm production, the generators overestimate the \(D^{+}\) fraction. The \(D^{0}\) fraction in Herwig is significantly lower than for the other three generators; Herwig, Pythia6, and Pythia8 are in good agreement with world average data. Distributions of \(x\) (\(x_{p}\)), the fraction of the heavy quark energy (momentum) carried by the bottom (charm) hadron have been studied using \(e^{+}e^{-}\) samples generated with the same showering parameters used in modern LHC tunes. Differences in the mean value of \(x\) generated differ by up to 5% for bottom and up to 12% for charm. Studies of \(f(z)\), the fraction of the jet momentum carried by the heavy flavor hadron, from \(t\bar{t}\) samples show good agreement among all the generators except for Herwig++, which has a mean value of \(z\) for bottom jets s higher by about 2%. Comparisons of \(f(z)\) distributions for high transverse momentum jets indicate that the treatment of heavy flavor pair production differs between among the generators. EvtGen was found to improve agreement with PDG values for the decays of heavy flavor particles, but modifications to the standard EvtGen inclusive decay table further improve agreement with the experimental measurements of branching fractions.
