**Abstract**

For the 1995 1m prototype data it was observed that particles escaping the calorimeter can produce light in the PMT/light guide region [1]. Using both test beam and laboratory data, evidence for this effect was found and the mechanism behind it identified as ionisation or Cherenkov light in the photocathode. For Module 0 this effect is expected to be smaller because of the use of smaller photomultipliers, light guides and fibre bundles. This note reports on a study done with Module 0 testbeam data from september 1996. For muons it is found that the effect is at least an order of magnitude smaller than what was found for the 1m prototypes. Moreover, it is also shown how pions which have longitudinal leakage also produce extra signals.

## 1 Introduction

As well known, muons deposits little energy in the Tile Calorimeter. Leaving the Calorimeter the muons will cross the girder system where the optic fibers are bundled and read out by photomultipliers via a light guide. If a muon somehow produces light by interactions in this optical system, a fake signal will be registered as coming from the corresponding cell (figure 1). Careful studies of muon scans with the tile prototypes and laboratory tests with Sr-90 source allowed to conclude that the signals were mainly due to Cherenkov light and ionisation in the fibre bundle ring and the photocathode of the photomultipliers used (Philips XP2012) [1].

In the above mentioned study the muon signals produced in the photomultiplier region were of the order 2pCb (corresponding to \(\sim\)0.3GeV), the same order of magnitude as the signals seen in individual cells actually crossed by muons. However, this was in the 1m prototype using a larger type of photomultiultipliers (XP2012) than the ones installed in Module 0 for the september 1996 test beam runs (Hamamatsu R5900). One would expect the effect to be much smaller in these data.

In stand-alone test beam runs the Calorimeter is not designed to have full containment of hadronic showers in particular 300GeV pions, as the final Atlas environment will provide additional material in front (\(\sim\)2\(\lambda\) at \(\eta\)=0) coming mainly from the electromagnetic calorimeter. The same mechanism that is effective for muons should also give raise to some extra signals for these pion-events with longitudinal leakage.

## 2 Setup

In order to study this effect one will have to aim the beam at a PMT, but preferably in such a manner that we are not producing direct (true) signals in the corresponding cell. A favourable choice is shown in figure 1. The beam is going through the calorimeter at a distance from the cell of interest, that at least for muons seem safe. This can be checked by looking at signals in neighbouring cells.

The runs available, however, were not done with pure muon beams, rather with 300GeV pion beams. As it turns out, these beams do contain a considerable amount of muons. Putting cuts on the total energy deposited in the calorimeter, it is possible to discriminate reasonable between pions and muons and between pions with different degrees of leakage.

The most prominent footprint of the effect, we are trying to study, are of course the raise and fall of the signal as the beam is scanned over the light producing area. This scanning is achieved on two levels:

* We consider a number of runs done with the test table in different z positions, all at \(\eta\)=-0.515.
* In each run the beam has a certain spread. The two beamchambers make it possible to reconstruct the impactpoint of each particle.

Ideally the reconstruction should be of the impact point in the girder region, but here the face-of-the calorimeter impact point provided by the standard off-line-monitoring software (Tilemon) have been used. This should not make a big difference, especially for small scanned areas.

## 3 Analysis and Results

### 300GeV pion beam

First of all we must try make sure what particles we are looking at. As figure 2 clearly shows we are not dealing with a pure pionbeam. The low energy peak must be ascribed to muons but unfortunately it is sitting on top of the leakage tail of the pion peak. Therefore we cannot on the basis of the deposited energy construct an effective selection criterion for muons. If we demand the energy to be between 0 and 20GeV a rough estimate would be that 0.5% of the events in this range are pions with leakage.

Apart from this cut we also choose three degrees of pion leakage, that is, three intervals of total energy deposited: 75-175, 175-275 and 275-375GeV.

FIGURE 2: The energy distribution in the 300GeV data and the cuts applied: (a) The muon cut 0-20GeV, (b) 75-175GeV, (c) 175-275GeV, (d) 275-375GeV.

For the four cuts we now plot the signal in PMT 38 against the z-coordinate. This is shown in figure 3. One notices, that the pions with much leakage, that is, the pions which deposit little energy in the calorimeter as a whole, show much larger signals than the fully contained ones. This signal reaches at most 0.5GeV, so after all, the effect is quite small compared to the incident pion energy.

The signal observed with the lowest cut containing mostly muons is \(\sim\)0.03GeV. The pions included in this cut must be expected to deposit at least 0.5GeV, as they have even more leakage than the pions in the other cuts. From this we can conclude that the signals produced by muons in the PMT region are smaller than 0.03GeV. This upper limit is an order of magnitude lower than the muon signal of \(\sim\)0.33GeV (or 2pCb) observed in the Tile Calorimeter prototype in 1995. The main reason should come from the different photomultiplier response, as confirmed by laboratory test with radioactive sources [1].

## 4 Conclusions

The effect of light production in the PMT-region of Module 0 in test beam data from september 1996 can clearly by observed. The data does not allow a quantitative determination of the effect for muons, we can only put an upper limit of about 0.03 GeV. As predicted this is much smaller than the effect observed in the 1m prototype, where muons signals of about 0.3GeV were found. There the false signals had magnitude comparable with that of signals from individual cells actually crossed by muons. Here they are at least an order of magnitude smaller. The main explanation for these changes is the smaller PMT's used in the Module 0 as compared to the 1m prototypes as confirmed by laboratory test with radioactive sources [1].

Also pions with leakage give raise to false signals. These are of the order 0.6GeV for 300GeV pions with \(\sim\) 70% leakage. The data show clearly the strong dependence of these signals upon the degree of leakage. We can conclude that the effect is important only for pions, which loose only a small fraction of their energy in the intended part of the Calorimeter.
