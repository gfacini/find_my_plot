Introduction

Assuming an estimated total \(t\bar{t}\) production cross section of 160 pb at \(\sqrt{s}=7\) TeV [1], we expect the production of one top quark pair decaying into the e/\(\mu\)+jets channel for every 20 nb\({}^{-1}\) of recorded LHC data, as well as one top quark pair decaying into the ee/e\(\mu\)/\(\mu\)+jets channel for every 110 nb\({}^{-1}\) of data1. While experimental selection criteria will further reduce the number of observable candidates, a handful of such candidates are expected to be selected with O(100) nb\({}^{-1}\) of data. To aid the interpretation of these early candidates in terms of signal and background, this note documents the expected distributions of key variables for events passing an early \(t\bar{t}\) candidate event selection which will be applied to ATLAS data at \(\sqrt{s}=7\) TeV. The object and event selections for both lepton plus jets and dilepton topologies are described, together with various distributions for events passing these selections, showing the expected relative contributions of signal and background.

## 2 Simulated event samples

For the generation of \(t\bar{t}\) signal and single top events, MC@NLO [4] v3.41 was used, with PDF set CTEQ66 [5], assuming a top mass of 172.5 GeV and normalizing the \(t\bar{t}\) cross-section to the prediction of [1], which is consistent with other NLO calculations. For single top the \(s\), \(t\) and \(Wt\) channels are included, normalizing to the MC@NLO cross-section and using the 'diagram removal scheme' [6] for \(Wt\) to remove overlaps with the \(t\bar{t}\) final state.

For the generation of \(W\)+(\(b\bar{b}\))+jets, \(\gamma^{*}\)/\(Z\)+(\(b\bar{b}\))+jets (Drell-Yan), and QCD multi-jet events, Alpgen v2.13 was used, invoking the MLM matching scheme [7] with matching parameters RCLUS=0.7 and ETCLUS=20, and using parton density function set CTEQ6L1 [8]. For the \(\gamma^{*}\)/\(Z\)+jets the phase space has been restricted to \(m(l^{+}l^{-})>40\) GeV. The \(W\)/\(Z\)+jets samples were normalized with a \(K\)-factor of 1.22 [9]. For the QCD multi-jet sample the generator-level \(p_{T}\) of the leading parton must be at least 35 GeV. QCD multi-jet events have also been subjected to filtering prior to full event simulation: events must have either a truth muon within \(|\eta|<2.8\) with a \(p_{T}\) of at least 10 GeV, or contain at least three truth jets (reconstructed from simulated stable particles after hadronization with the anti-\(k_{t}\) algorithm [10] with parameter R=0.4) with a \(p_{T}\) greater than 25 GeV, as well as an additional truth jet with a \(p_{T}\) greater than 17 GeV.2 The QCD samples were normalized using the Alpgen prediction. All events were hadronized with Herwig[11], using Jimmy [12] for the underlying event model. Diboson \(WW\), \(WZ\) and \(ZZ\)+jet events were produced using Herwig, normalized as in [9]. The effect of pileup, _i.e._ additional proton-proton interactions in the same beam crossing, was not simulated.

Footnote 2: For the electron+jets channel, these filter cuts are slightly tighter than the final analysis cuts, however the magnitude of this effect has been calculated to be about 10 %, which is small in comparison with the expected total uncertainty on the QCD background rate after selection.

Subsequent detector and trigger simulation, followed by offline reconstruction, has been performed with standard ATLAS software making use of GEANT4 [13].

## 3 Object selection

The reconstruction of \(t\bar{t}\) events makes use of reconstructed electrons, muons and jets, and the overall momentum balance in the transverse plane. The following criteria are used to define the selected objects in the events:

* _Electrons:_ Electron candidates are required to pass the medium electron selection as defined in [14], with \(p_{T}>20\) GeV and \(|\eta_{Cluster}|<2.47\), excluding the calorimeter crack region at \(1.37<\)\(|\eta_{cluster}|<1.52\), where \(\eta_{cluster}\) is the pseudo-rapidity3 of the energy cluster in the calorimeter associated with the candidate. In addition, the track must have an associated hit in the innermost pixel layer in order to remove photon conversions (except in regions with known dead modules), and the energy deposition in the calorimeter within a cone of radius \(\Delta R=0.2\) must be less that \(4\GeV+0.023\cdotp_{T}^{\ell}\), where \(\Delta R=\sqrt{\Delta\eta^{2}+\Delta\phi^{2}}\) and \(p_{T}^{\ell}\) is the transverse momentum of the lepton. The last requirement ensures electrons are isolated, reducing the rate of hadrons in jets misidentified as electrons, and suppressing the selection of electrons from heavy flavour decays inside jets. Footnote 3: In the right-handed ATLAS coordinate system, the pseudorapidity \(\eta\) is defined as \(\eta=-\ln(\tan(\theta/2))\), where the polar angle \(\theta\) is measured with respect to the LHC beamline. The azimuthal angle \(\phi\) is measured with respect to the \(x\)-axis, which points towards the centre of the LHC ring. The z-axis is parallel to the anti-clockwise beam.
* _Muons:_ Muons are reconstructed by combining muon tracks from the inner detector and muon spectrometer, as defined as 'chain 2' in [15], with \(p_{T}>20\GeV\) and \(|\eta|<2.5\). To ensure isolation, the energy deposition in the calorimeter and the sum of track transverse momenta measured in cones of radius of \(\Delta R=0.3\) around the muon track are each required to be less than \(4\GeV\). Additionally, muons are required to have a distance \(\Delta R\) greater than \(0.4\) from any jet with \(p_{T}>20\GeV\), further suppressing muons from heavy flavour decays inside jets.
* _Jets:_ Jets are reconstructed with the anti-\(k_{t}\) algorithm (R=0.4) clustered from EM-scale topological clusters in the calorimeters [16]. These jets are then calibrated to the hadronic energy scale, using a \(p_{T}\) and \(\eta\) dependent correction factor obtained from simulation [17]. If a jet is the closest jet to an electron candidate and the corresponding distance \(\Delta R\) is less than \(0.2\), the jet is removed from consideration in order to avoid double-counting of electrons as jets. Jets are considered \(b\)-tagged if the secondary vertex-based tagger SV0 returns a value above a threshold that is defined by a \(50\%\) tagging efficiency, obtained from studies of simulated \(t\bar{t}\) events [18].
* _Missing transverse energy:_ The missing transverse energy is constructed from the vector sum of all calorimeter cells, resolved into the transverse plane. Cells not associated to a jet or electron are included at the EM scale. Cells associated with jets are taken at the corrected energy scale that was used for jets, while the contribution from cells associated with electrons are substituted by the calibrated transverse energy of the electron. Finally, the contribution from muons passing the 'chain 2' requirements are included, also removing the contribution of any calorimeter cell associated to the muon.

## 4 Event selections

The selections for both lepton+jets and dilepton events start by requiring the presence of at least one lepton (\(e\) or \(\mu\)) associated with a leptonic high-level trigger object of the same flavour with a \(10\GeV\) threshold. Events must have a reconstructed primary vertex with at least 5 tracks, and are discarded if any jet with \(p_{T}>10\GeV\) at the EM scale fails jet quality cuts designed to reject jets arising from out-of-time activity or calorimeter noise [19]. These quality cuts remove a negligible fraction of simulated events.

The lepton+jets selection then requires the presence of exactly one offline-reconstructed electron or muon with \(p_{T}>20\GeV\), satisfying the object requirements given in Section 3 above and matching a leptonic high-level trigger object within \(\Delta R<0.15\). At least four jets with \(p_{T}>20\GeV\) and \(|\eta|<2.5\) are then required, at least one of which must be \(b\)-tagged. Finally, the missing transverse energy must satisfy \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}>20\GeV\).

The dilepton selection requires two oppositely-charged leptons (\(ee\), \(\mu\mu\) or \(e\mu\)) each satisfying \(p_{T}>20\GeV\), at least one of which must be associated to a leptonic high-level trigger object. At least two jets with \(p_{T}>20\GeV\) are required, but no \(b\)-tagging requirements are imposed. In the \(ee\) channel, to suppress backgrounds from Drell-Yan and QCD multi-jet events, the missing transverse energy must satisfy \(E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}>40\) GeV, and the invariant mass of the two leptons must be at least 5 GeV from the \(Z\)-boson mass, _i.e._\(|m_{ee}-m_{Z}|>5\) GeV. For the muon channel, the corresponding requirements are \(E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}>30\) GeV and \(|m_{\mu\mu}-m_{Z}|>10\) GeV. For the \(e\mu\) channel, where the background from \(Z\to ee\) and \(Z\to\mu\mu\) is expected to be much smaller, no \(E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}\) or \(Z\)-mass veto cuts are applied, but the event \(H_{\rm T}\), defined as the scalar sum of the transverse energies of the two leptons and all the selected jets, must satisfy \(H_{\rm T}>150\) GeV.

## 5 Key distributions

The distributions of key variables in simulated events which pass the single and dilepton event selections are shown in Figures 1 to 7. These plots show the expected relative contributions of the various signal and background processes discussed in Section 2. Each plot is normalised so that the sum of all expected processes is unity.

For the single electron selection, Figure 1(left) shows the three-jet mass \(m_{\rm jjj}\), defined as the invariant mass of the three-jet combination with the largest \(p_{T}\), and provides an approximate estimate of the mass of the hadronically-decaying top quark. Figure 1(right) shows the corresponding distribution for the single muon selection, and Figure 2 the corresponding \(E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}\) distributions. It should be noted that the simulated event sample for the QCD multi-jet background has significantly lower integrated luminosity than the others, and suffers from large intrinsic uncertainties due to limited knowledge of the lepton fake rates and the total production cross section. A full quantitative evaluation of this background requires further study in data samples larger than those presently available.

For the \(ee\) dilepton selection, Figure 3 shows the number of selected jets with \(p_{T}>20\) GeV, and the number of \(b\)-tagged jets. Figures 4 and 5 show the corresponding distributions for \(\mu\mu\) and \(e\mu\) events. Figure 6 shows the \(E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}\) distributions for the \(ee\) and \(\mu\mu\) channels, and Figure 7 the \(H_{\rm T}\) distribution for the \(e\mu\) channel. No QCD multi-jet background events are shown in the dilepton channel as none pass the selection criteria.
