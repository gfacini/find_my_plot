The possible signature from the cascade decays of gluino via light Higgs boson production at LHC energy is studied. The dominant decay channel \(h^{0}\to b\bar{b}\) is considered. The branching ratio of \(h^{0}\) production reaches 50 % for some set of the SUSY parameters. It is shown that it is possible to extract signal \(h^{0}\to b\bar{b}\) from \(t\bar{t}\) background after applying SUSY event cuts.

Introduction

The standard way to search for squark and gluino production is to find events with a large missing transverse energy (\(E_{T}^{mis}\)) and 2 or 4 jets. This signature is created when squarks and gluinos decay directly into the lightest neutralino: \(\tilde{g}\to q+\tilde{q}+\tilde{\chi}_{1}^{0};\tilde{q}\to q+\tilde{\chi}_{1}^{0}\). At the LHC energy a mass region up to 1 TeV for squark and gluino is reachable. At the large mass values the branching ratios for direct decays are about 15% [1] and the cascade decays are dominant. In this case the gluino (or squark) decays into a heavier chargino or neutralino:

\[\begin{array}{rcl}1.&\tilde{g}&\rightarrow&q+\tilde{q}+\tilde{\chi}_{1}^{0}\\ 2.&\tilde{g}&\rightarrow&q+\tilde{q}^{\prime}+\tilde{\chi}_{1}^{\pm}\\ 3.&\tilde{g}&\rightarrow&g+\tilde{\chi}_{1}^{0}\end{array}.\]

The charginos and neutralinos in turn decay into lighter supersymmetrical particles and \(Z^{0}\), \(W^{\pm}\), \(H^{0}\), \(H^{\pm}\) :

\[\begin{array}{rcl}1.&\tilde{\chi}_{i}^{0}&\rightarrow&\tilde{\chi}_{k}^{0}+ Z^{0}(H^{0})\\ 2.&\tilde{\chi}_{i}^{0}&\rightarrow&\tilde{\chi}_{k}^{\pm}+W^{\pm}(H^{\pm}) \end{array}\]

In this case the SUSY events have the following signature: softened \(E_{T}^{mis}\) distribution, large multiplicity of jets and isotropic topology. As a result of the chargino and neutralino decays the final state in general contains \(Z^{0},W^{\pm},H^{0},H^{\pm}\) particles. Another interesting signature could thus be to look for light Higgs boson (\(h^{0}\)) production in the final state [2].

In the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) the branching ratios for the different decay modes and mass values of chargino and neutralino depend on five basic parameters. The observation of the \(h^{0}\) signal in SUSY events could be helpful in restricting the parameter space that is available.

The dominant decay channel for the light neutral Higgs boson \(h^{0}\) is \(h^{0}\to b\bar{b}\) (about 90 %). This signal cannot in the standard processes, e.g. gg fusion, be extracted from the large background of \(pp\to t\bar{t}+X\) processes. In the SUSY scenario, however, event cuts give a good possibility to reduce the \(t\bar{t}\) background sufficiently and to obtain a visible \(h^{0}\to b\bar{b}\) signal. This could thus be another way to detect light Higgs boson production.

## 2 The Detector Model and Simulation.

The simulation of SUSY events was done with the ISASUSY Monte Carlo [3], while for the \(pp\to t\bar{t}\) background PYTHIA 5.5 was used. A generation of nonzero lifetimes for unstable particles and second vertex definition have been implemented in ISASUSY to simulate b-tagging.

For the tracking part of the detector a simplified model made by S.Gadomski (described in detail in [4]) has been used. This model is based on a detector consisting of a Silicon Tracker/Vertex (SITV), an outer tracker and a forward tracker. Magnetic field, multiple scattering and detector response were taken into account to get the resolution for the impact parameter. The impact parameter resolution was obtained as a function of momentum and rapidity of charged particles and is valid for \(|\eta|\leq 2\) and a momentum \(P\geq 1\)

B-tagging

Several processes contribute to the b-jet production in SUSY events for this set of parameters:

1. \(h_{0}\) decay into \(b\bar{b}\) jets;

2. first stage of the gluino decay into \(b\bar{b}\) jets;

3. first stage of the gluino decay into \(t\bar{t}\) jets with the dominant decay \(t\bar{t}\to W^{+}W^{-}b\bar{b}\);

4. \(Z^{0}\to b\bar{b}\) decay.

The contributions from these processes and mean values of the transverse momenta for \(b(\bar{b})\) jets for the gluino mass \(M_{\tilde{g}}\) = 750 GeV and \(M_{\tilde{g}}\) = 1000 GeV are given in Table 1. One can see that the contribution from \(h^{0}\) decay to b-jet production is about 40% and the background from other processes is not small. However the mean value of the transverse momentum for the b-jets produced in the first stage of the gluino decay is 2-3 times higher than from the \(h_{0}\) decay. This gives a chance to reduce the combinatorial background from such processes.

The standard b-tagging procedure used is based on the detection of charged particles in a jet with an impact parameter greater than 200 \(\mu m\) and \(P_{T}\) > 2 GeV/c. If the jet has more than \(n_{cut}\) tracks satisfying these requirements it is tagged as a b-jet.

The efficiency of b-tagging and the mean multiplicity of real b-jets before and after b-tagging for SUSY events are given in Tables 2 and 3. To estimate the possible background from non-b jets the efficiency for c-jets to be tagged as b-jets and the mean multiplicity of c-jets were calculated and are also shown in Tables 2,3. One can see that the efficiency of b-tagging is 65% for real b-jets and 24% for c-jets. The multiplicity of c-jets after b-tagging is 0.36(0.38). This value is not small in comparison with the multiplicity of the b-jets produced from \(h^{0}\) decay: \(<n_{b}>_{h}=0.46<n_{b}>_{b-tag}\). In order to reduce non-b jets background we increased the required value of transverse momentum in the b-tagging criteria to \(P_{T}\geq 4\) GeV/c. The efficiency of b-tagging for real b and c-jets in this case is given in the same Tables.

To make the b-tagging the jets were first reconstructed at particle level. The LUCLUS routine from PYTHIA have been adapted to the ISASUSY Monte Carlo to reconstruct the jets and to define the jet axis. The impact parameter smeared by the resolution function was then calculated for each particle in the jet. If some particle level jet passed the b-tagging criteria the direction of this jet was compared with the direction of jets found by clustering in the calorimeter. The jet found in the calorimeter was then tagged as b-jet if the difference in direction was within the interval \(\Delta\eta,\Delta\phi\leq 0.1\).

## 6 Results

The invariant mass distributions for two b-tagged jets in 40000 SUSY events with \(M_{\tilde{g}}\) = 750 GeV are shown in Fig.3. For the solid-line histogram all b-tagged jets at the calorimeter level were used. Since high \(P_{T}\) b-jets are more likely to come from \(\tilde{g}\to b\bar{b}+X\) rather than from \(h^{0}\) decay (see Table 1) they can be excluded to reduce combinatorial background. The dashed line histogram was obtained when the two jets with the highest were excluded while for the shaded histogram we excluded the three highest \(P_{T}\) jets. One can see a clear signal from light Higgs boson in all three histograms, but the ratio between signal and background is considerably improved in the last case.

Exactly the same procedure was applied to \(t\bar{t}\) background events. The following SUSY event cuts were used:

1. \(E_{T}^{mis}\geq 100GeV\), \(N_{jet}(E_{T}\geq 50GeV)\geq 6\), \(circularity\geq 0.2\);
2. \(E_{T}^{mis}\geq 200GeV\), \(N_{jet}(E_{T}\geq 50GeV)\geq 8\), \(circularity\geq 0.3\).

where \(N_{jet}\) is the multiplicity of jets fullfilling the \(E_{T}\) cut and \(circularity\) is the sphericity in the transverse plane. Cut 1 was applied to SUSY events with the gluino mass \(M_{\tilde{g}}=750\) GeV and cut 2 when \(M_{\tilde{g}}=1000\) GeV.

The invariant mass distributions of the two b-tagged jets for the SUSY events and \(t\bar{t}\) background after cuts are shown in Fig.4,5. The total statistic for these plots corresponds to an integrated luminosity \(10^{5}pb^{-1}\). A clear signal from the light Higgs boson is observed above background on both plots. In SUSY events with \(M_{\tilde{g}}=1000\) GeV we had to exclude the four jets with highest \(P_{T}\). This procedure help us to reduce combinatorial \(t\bar{t}\) background more because the mean multiplicity of jets in \(t\bar{t}\) events is smaller than in the SUSY events.

The possible contribution from \(Z^{0}\to b\bar{b}\) production in the cascade decays of gluino calculated for the SUSY parameter space used (Sec.3) doesn't exceed 10%. So if Br.R. for light Higgs boson production is more than 10% the signal can in principle be discovered.

## 7 Conclusion

The signal from \(h^{0}\to b\bar{b}\) production in the cascade decays of gluinos can be observed above \(t\bar{t}\) background for some set of the SUSY parameters after applying SUSY event cuts. For the gluino mass \(M_{\tilde{g}}=750\) GeV the signal can be detected at an integrated luminosity of \(10^{4}pb^{-1}\) while for a gluino mass equal to 1000 GeV an integrated luminosity of \(10^{5}pb^{-1}\) is required.

This means that a new way to discover the signal from the SUSY processes is possible. On the other hand this is also the way to observe the light Higgs boson production in the dominant decay channel \(h^{0}\to b\bar{b}\). Some further work using a more realistic detector simulation concerning tracking, magnetic field and pile-up effects should however be done. A detailed study of the parameter space for which it will be possible to observe signal is also required.
