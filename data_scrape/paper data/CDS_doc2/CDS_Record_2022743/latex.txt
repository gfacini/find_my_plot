Proposal for particle-level object and observable definitions for use in physics measurements at the LHC

The ATLAS Collaboration

###### Abstract

Measurements and theory predictions at the Large Hadron Collider become increasingly precise. This makes it necessary to use observables and definitions in the analyses that allow for an accurate comparison of theoretical and experimental results. Moreover, measurements should be defined such that they have a minimal model dependence and that future predictions can be accurately and unambiguously compared with present results with minimal prior knowledge of experimental or model-dependent definitions of the final state objects. A suitable measurement definition is based on the stable particles that enter in the detector and, when appropriate, on their physical parents. This note proposes a set of definitions for the most commonly used generator-level particles, based on information available in most Monte Carlo event generator records, and presents examples of observables derived from these definitions. The use of particle-level definitions common across experiments and theory, such as those proposed here, would facilitate comparisons and combinations of data between experiments.

## 1 Introduction

The precision of measurements and theory predictions achieved at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) requires an accurate definition of the observables used in physics measurements. Such a definition should facilitate the comparison between theoretical predictions and experimental results with the least possible dependence on the Monte Carlo (MC) event generators available at the time of the measurement.

A suitable definition of the observables is based on the physical particles that enter the detector.This naturally includes the stable particles which account for the majority of interactions with the detector material, and from which all measurements are ultimately made, but in some cases it is acceptable to use also their parents as explained in the following Sections.

The use of particle-level object definitions in cross-section measurements is a standard methodology in high-energy physics [1; 2] to reduce model dependence and to provide a clear interface between experiment and theory. Standardised tools exist to compare theory predictions to such measurements [3; 4; 5].

In this document, a proposal for particle-level object definitions is presented. This proposal was developed initially as a set of guidelines for ATLAS analyses. The aim of this note is to serve as a starting document for a more general discussion. Further work is needed in particular to define particle-level objects, such as \(\tau\) leptons, prompt photons in the jet building, and also more complex observables constructed from these particle-level objects.

The note is organised as follows: in Section 2 the guiding principles of the object and observable definitions are outlined; in Section 3 a summary of the proposed particle-level object definitions is given; in Section 4 the definition of particle-level observables in complex final-state is discussed; and in Section 5 the overall procedure for construction of the event topology at particle-level is summarised. Finally, after the summary, a technical glossary is given in Section 7.

## 2 General guiding principles

The guiding principles for a suitable measurement definition at the particle-level are:

* Specify observables in a theoretically well defined, unambiguous way, and maximally independent of the technical details of the MC generators.
* Correct the measured observables for detector inefficiencies and resolution effects.
* Avoid large extrapolations outside the detector acceptance (for example, in rapidity and transverse momentum) to minimise the model dependence of the measurement. The detector acceptance defined at the generator level is called "fiducial phase space" in the following.
* To combine different measurements (for example, measurements using electrons and muons in the same experiment or between different experiments), simple definitions of this fiducial phase space are preferred, in which only the main geometrical cuts are implemented. As an example, it is useful to have the same definition for the pseudo-rapidity range for muons and electrons.

* Specify particle-level objects as close as possible to the definition used for experimentally reconstructed objects to minimise model-dependent corrections when correcting the detector-level objects for detector efficiency and resolution effects. The definition should take into account the calibration procedure of the physics objects in the detector.
* Define complex objects at particle level using operational procedures based only on the simple particle-level objects defined in Section 3 of this note. Examples include W/Z bosons in a multi-boson environment and top quarks.

## 3 Particle-level object definition

In the following Sections, the Particle Data Group's "Monte Carlo Numbering Scheme" identifier [6] (or "PDG ID") is referred to with the symbol \(\mathrm{id_{PDG}}\). Any technical terminology marked with a dagger (\(\dagger\)) indicates that an explanation of its definition is provided in the Technical Glossary at the end of this document. In this note \(\tau\) leptons are not discussed explicitly as particle-level objects used for measurements.

### Particle definitions

* **Stable particles** are defined as those with a lifetime \(c\tau_{0}>10\) mm. A stable particle in the MC event record has HepMC [7] status code equal to 1.
* **Prompt or lepton-associated photons** are generated final-state particles with \(\mathrm{id_{PDG}}=22\), _not_ from \(\mathrm{hadrons^{\dagger}}\) or \(\tau^{\dagger}\) leptons.
* **Prompt leptons** are generated final-state particles with \(|\mathrm{id_{PDG}}|=11\ldots 16\), (\(e\), \(\nu_{e}\), \(\mu\), \(\nu_{\mu}\), \(\tau\), \(\nu_{\tau}\)) _not_ from \(\mathrm{hadrons^{\dagger}}\).

### Prompt leptons and radiated photons

The definition of prompt leptons (charged or neutral), as given in the Section 3.1, is less model dependent than asking for a given mother boson, in events where \(W\) or \(Z\) bosons decay into lepton pairs. This definition was found to be equivalent to the requirement of a mother boson in current MC generators.

The definition of prompt photons or lepton-associated photons, as given in the Section 3.1, includes photons produced in hard-scattering processes, photons produced by initial state radiation from quarks involved in the hard-scattering process and photons from resonance decays such as \(H\to\gamma\gamma\).

Given that charged leptons can emit photons via QED Final State Radiation (QED FSR) processes, the definition of prompt charged leptons can be of three kinds: Born, bare and dressed.

The _Born_ leptons are leptons "prior to QED Final State Radiation (FSR)". The term refers to the leptons considered at the lowest-order diagram in the electromagnetic coupling \(\alpha_{\mathrm{QED}}\) for the process under study. In many MC generators, the pre-FSR leptons are available as hard-process documentation particles which should not be used as particle-level objects if one is absolutely strict about their physical properties. These may have a meaning only if one neglects, for example, interference effects between initial and final state QED radiation in the case of \(W\) and \(Z\) boson production.

The _bare_ leptons are leptons "after QED FSR". The bare \(e\) or \(\mu\) are the stable particles that appear in the generator record, with QED FSR corrections enabled in the generation. The bare leptons depend on the technical details of the implementation of QED radiation in the MC generators.

For _dressed_ leptons, a cone or a jet algorithm can be used to cluster all photons around the direction of the bare lepton, forming a lepton after partial QED radiation recovery. In this procedure, it is proposed to use all photons _not_ from hadrons decays. Studies have shown that with such a definition the contribution of the Initial State Radiation (ISR) photon energy to the dressed lepton energy is negligibly small and if needed, a correction for ISR photons could be calculated _a posteriori_. The dressing procedure is an operational definition that can be applied to any MC generator, and does not need any expert knowledge of the structure and of the numbering conventions of a particular MC event record.

Born leptons are fully comparable particle-level objects and their measurements can be directly combined, provided interference effects between initial and final state QED radiation can be neglected. Since most of the QED FSR photons are collinear to the charged leptons, the difference between observables computed using dressed electrons and muons is generally small, \(\lesssim 0.1\%\), and thus also a combination at dressed level is meaningful, when the measurement accuracy is above the few per-mille level. Measurements defined with bare electrons and bare muons cannot be directly combined.

Following what is done in many existing measurements, in order to dress final-state leptons with close-by photons, it is proposed to add to the lepton four-momentum all photons in a \(\Delta R<0.1\) cone around the lepton direction. It is also proposed to investigate further the dressing procedure using a cluster algorithm, such as anti-\(k_{\mathrm{t}}\)[8] (\(R=0.1\)). The anti-\(k_{\mathrm{t}}\) algorithm gives a unambiguous prescription on the assignment of photons to leptons. Such a procedure is expected to be more appropriate with respect to the cone algorithm in complex topologies, such as the case of a boosted \(Z\) boson where pairs of electrons or muons and associated photons may be close together.

For complex topologies that involve multiple types of objects in the final state, for example, leptons and jets, it is proposed to use dressed leptons as the baseline definition. For the study of the properties of intermediate states like single \(W\) or \(Z\) the proposal is to provide observables at the Born and dressed levels, when this is meaningful for comparisons with theory predictions. Examples of such measurements are the \(Z\) and \(W\) boson polarisation and the transverse momentum differential cross sections, or fundamental Standard Model parameters like \(\sin^{2}\theta_{W}\) and \(m_{W}\).

### Jets

Jet buildingJets are defined with a jet algorithm that clusters a set of particles. The jet algorithm used should be infra-red and collinear safe. Most ATLAS analyses use the anti-\(k_{t}\) jet clustering algorithm [8] with a distance parameter \(R=0.4\) or \(R=0.6\). The jets at generator level are formed with the following procedure:

1. Collect all stable particles in the event record.
2. Identify electrons, muons & neutrinos _not_ from hadrons\({}^{\dagger}\).
3. Dress electrons & muons with photons _not_ from hadrons\({}^{\dagger}\).
4. Cluster all stable particles, excluding the particles found in (2) and (3).

It is thus proposed not to use prompt photons included in the lepton dressing in the jet building. Whether any remaining prompt photons should be included in particle-level jets will depend on the analysis.

Jet calibration and pile-up correctionsThe jet calibration in ATLAS is based on jets excluding all neutrinos and muons from the jet input particle collection to avoid tails in the distribution of the calorimeter response to jets and thus simplify the jet calibration.

Nevertheless it is proposed to include muons and neutrinos that are among the decay products of hadrons in the jet definition, despite the model dependence introduced when correcting the jets for detector effects. This simplifies the definition of the overall event reconstruction (neutrinos in jets or in missing transverse momentum) and allows for better transverse momentum balance of the built particle-level physics objects. The model dependence of this procedure needs to be evaluated in particular for heavy-flavour (HF) jets. More studies are needed to understand the effect of excluding neutrinos and muons or even electrons.

In ATLAS, energy due to additional proton-proton interactions (pile-up) is subtracted event-by-event using the jet area and the median \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) density \(\rho\) in the event [8, 9]. The jet area is a measure of the sensitivity of the jet to pile-up, and is measured jet-by-jet. The density, \(\rho\), is a measure of the pile-up activity in the event. It is obtained for each event from the median of the transverse energy density \(\mathrm{d}^{2}E_{\mathrm{T}}/\mathrm{d}\eta\,\mathrm{d}\phi\) from all particles in the event. The pile-up correction for a jet with jet area \(A\) is then \(\rho A\). In this procedure, particles from the underlying event (UE) are also removed. Since particle-level jets contain the particles from the UE, the correction for detector effects will add back the contribution from the UE particles, and therefore will introduce a model dependence.

A solution to this problem would be to apply an operational definition to subtract the UE at particle level. To achieve this, one should study to which extent the same UE correction is obtained when applying it to particles from the hard scattering alone in a single p-p collision event, or when including the pile-up particles.

An alternative approach was developed by CMS in Ref. [10], where the UE contribution is subtracted from \(\rho\). Nevertheless this approach still requires a model-dependent definition of the UE particles.

Choosing a common baseline requires further studies following the guideline of the minimal model dependence.

Jet flavour assignmentA heavy-flavour (HF) jet is a jet that contains a weakly decaying HF hadron with \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>5\) GeV\(\dagger\). The treatment of the quarkonia is analysis dependent and is not considered further. It is proposed to use an indirect association of the HF hadron to the jet, as explained in the following. The clustering of particle-level jets does not include HF hadrons in the input particle collection, since their lifetimes are shorter than the stable particle definition. However, a HF hadron can be included in the jet finding as a particle with an infinitely small momentum and the presence of this \(b\)-hadron (or charm hadron) in the jet defines then the jet flavour. This procedure is called ghost-association [9]. The recommendation is to use this technique in the particle-level jet clustering to make the jet flavour assignment. A \(b\)-jet is a jet which contains at least one \(b\)-hadron and a \(c\)-jet is a jet which contains at least one charm hadron and is not a \(b\)-jet.

An alternative to the proposed baseline could be to use the decay products of \(b\)-hadrons. Many questions arise that have not been addressed in this document, such as how to treat the case when the decay productsare reconstructed as belonging to different jets or how to deal with stable particles not measured because of magnetic field effects or reconstruction inefficiencies.

Jet-lepton overlap removalWhen a cut on the rapidity-phi separation, \(\Delta R_{l\text{-jet}}\), is needed at detector level (to remove jets that are reconstructed as electrons), at particle level it is proposed to define the measurement phase space including a \(\Delta R_{l\text{-jet}}\) cut close to the one used in the analysis (typically \(\Delta R_{l\text{-jet}}<0.3\)-\(0.4\) is used). This cut concerns only the particle-level leptons not included in the jet constituents.

The choice of the removal procedure (namely reject objects or veto events) is analysis dependent. Nevertheless the cleanest methodology is to veto the events where \(e\) and \(\mu\) are close to a jet with a \(\Delta R_{l\text{-jet}}\) cut that matches the value used at detector level.

### Missing transverse momentum

The goal of providing a definition of particle-level missing transverse momentum, \(E_{\text{T}}^{\text{miss}}\), is to identify the true transverse vector sum of invisible hard particles from the hard process. For this reason, the most appropriate particle-level definition is the sum of all neutrinos (and SUSY neutralinos, etc.) _not_ from hadron decays\({}^{\dagger}\).

### Isolation

In many data analyses isolation cuts, based on information from the calorimeter and the tracking detectors, are applied to improve the identification of leptons and photons. It is not proposed to apply any isolation cut at particle level in the case of leptons, since the detector-level isolation cuts have in general a high efficiency, which is corrected for based on in-situ measurements.

However, electrons from highly boosted parents may overlap with each other and therefore their energy may be badly measured. In some analyses, this problem is avoided by applying a \(\Delta R\) cut between electrons at detector level. To satisfy the guidelines of this note, namely to keep the particle-level fiducial-space definition simple and close to that of the measurement, it is proposed for same-flavour electron and muon pairs, to apply also at particle level, the \(\Delta R\) cut applied in the analysis.

In the case of measurements with prompt photons, an isolation criteria at particle level is applied when it is of interest to suppress the particle-level photons from the fragmentation of quarks and gluons. Examples of these measurements are single or diphoton direct production and weak vector boson production associated to photons.

An isolation cut on particle-level photons is often applied by implementing a threshold on the transverse energy or on the fraction of transverse energy in a cone around the photon. The threshold chosen at particle level must match the one chosen at detector level, once calibration corrections are accounted for. Other procedures to define isolated photons at particle level level (following a "smooth" cone isolation or a "democratic approach") [11, 12], have been developed.

Treatment of complex topologies

Particle-level objects can also be used to define higher-level observables in complex final states. This Section discusses two examples of using well-defined particle-level objects in physics analysis.

### Multi-boson events

In some analyses dealing with multi-lepton final-states from the decays of \(W\) and \(Z\), the phase space is defined by requiring that the vector boson mass is close to its resonance mass in order to interpret the physics results in terms of weak boson gauge interactions.

In this case, it is proposed to use an algorithmic approach rather than the MC particle-level information to define the fiducial phase space. Final-state prompt electrons, muons and neutrinos at particle level are associated (as decay products) to the \(W\) and \(Z\) with an algorithmic approach based on an estimator satisfying the charge and lepton flavour conservation which exploits the line shape of the \(W\) and \(Z\) resonances.

The \(WZ\) diboson analysis is a particular example, in which the algorithm used at particle level is not the same as used at detector level, in order to remove a significant bias in the physics interpretation of the measurement. This bias manifests itself as different measured cross sections between final states with multi-leptons of the same flavour and final states with multi-leptons of different flavour (e.g. between \(eeev_{e}\) and \(ee\mu\nu_{\mu}\) final states) while for \(WZ\) production in the region of the weak gauge boson resonances, the interference effects between final states with same-flavour leptons are well below the percent level and therefore the cross section is expected to be the same within one per cent.

The origin of the bias is mainly due to the fact that when associating the measured leptons to the reconstructed \(W\) and \(Z\) bosons at detector level, only the reconstructed \(Z\) boson mass is used to assign the leptons to a specific vector boson parent, since the observables related to the reconstructed \(W\) boson have large experimental uncertainties. The bias is present at detector level and the aim of the analysis is to develop an algorithmic approach that reduces this bias at particle level with minimal reliance on a specific model that associates the decay leptons to the parent boson.

### Particle-level operational definition of the top quark

ATLAS has recently presented differential cross section measurements of final state observables in events with top quark pairs (\(t\bar{t}\)) where the kinematic properties of top quarks (such as the top-quark transverse momentum or the invariant mass of the top anti-top quark system) are defined using an operational definition based on particle-level objects in events where a top quark pair is produced [13]. Such operational definitions were developed for semi-leptonic [13, 14] and for dilepton [14, 15]\(t\bar{t}\) events.

Particle-level objects are constructed as outlined in Section 3, namely the leptons from the W-boson decay, the particle-level \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\), and all jets, including the b-jets from the top decay. These objects are then combined to the "particle-level top quark", called "pseudo-top", using a simple combination prescription from leptons and jets in the final state.

The pseudo-top definition provides a particle-level definition that allows the measurements to be compared to particle-level theoretical predictions (e.g. MC generators). To compare the measurements to fixed-order QCD calculations (e.g. MCFM or top++), a further step is needed in order to correct the theoretical predictions from parton- to particle-level.

## 5 Procedure to construct the event topology at particle level

Based on the proposals presented in Sections 3 and 4, in the case of events containing charged leptons, neutrinos and jets in the fiducial phase space, the full event topology at particle level is proposed to be constructed as follows:

1. Select the stable particles.
2. Select prompt leptons (e, \(\nu_{e}\), \(\mu\), \(\nu_{\mu}\)) and associate photons (not from hadrons) to electrons and muons to define dressed-level charged leptons.
3. Define particle-level jets by clustering all stable particles excluding the particles found in step (2).
4. Assign the jet flavour based on heavy-flavour hadrons ghost-matched to jets.
5. Sum all prompt neutrinos defined in (2) to form the missing transverse momentum.
6. Resolve lepton-lepton and jet-lepton overlap following a procedure close to that used at the detector level.
7. Define other particle-level observables in complex event topologies based on the particle-level objects defined above, as shown in the case of two specific examples in Section 4.

## 6 Summary

With the increasing precision of experimental measurements and the corresponding theory predictions an accurate definition of the particle-level observables is of great importance for detailed comparisons between different experiments and with theoretical calculations. In this note, a proposal for particle-level object definitions is presented in the case of charged leptons, neutrinos, jets and missing transverse energy.

More work is required to define precisely how to deal with complex topologies, as an example particle-level \(\tau\) leptons and prompt photons in jet building for complex topologies.

## 7 Technical glossary

Several terms have been used which require a precise and careful definition before implementation. This glossary presents such definitions for the terms relevant to the scope of this note:* **Physical:** A physical particle is one whose momentum is considered physically reliable (on-mass-shell and represented in the lab frame) and the particle is measurable, such as leptons, photons or (possibly decayed) hadrons. These have status code 1 or 2. The various generator models often also produce intermediate states, such as quarks, gluons, hadronisation strings/clusters/diquarks, and electroweak resonances, which are not physical by definition. The four-momenta of these non-physical states can be calculation artefacts and are not reliable, or may only be available in selected generators. However, if used carefully, these (generator-specific) states may nevertheless have a merit.
* **Not from hadron:** This characterisation is used in the definition of prompt photons, leptons, neutrinos etc. _not_ produced in the decay of physical hadrons or their descendents. This definition requires a recursive check: iterating through the event record from the final state object up the chain, no physical decayed hadron must be found. In practice, since the physical decay part of an event record never involves interactions of two decaying hadrons, this algorithm typically involves no branchings, and stops when the hadronisation phase (in the form of an unphysical parent string or cluster) or hard process (again with a parent particle outside the physical status group) is reached.
* **Not from \(\tau\):** Exactly as for "not from hadron", but the forbidden (recursive) parent type is a \(\tau\) lepton.
* these final states are of primary interest to \(b\)-physics analyses. Technically, HF hadrons may be defined as _primary_ (hadrons produced directly from hadronisation) or _weakly decaying_ (a weakly decaying \(b\)
- or \(c\)-flavoured hadron is one after whose decay the \(b\) or \(c\) flavour has been lost.)
