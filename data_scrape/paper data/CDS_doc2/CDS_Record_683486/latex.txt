## 1 Dimensions and tolerances of master plates and spacers

### Thickness tolerances

The total thickness of a glued premodule of the tile calorimeter is to be about \(306\,mm\). For such a stack, 34 half-periods will be used. One half-period is composed of a master plate, which is about \(5\,mm\) thick, and one layer of spacers, about \(4\,mm\) thick. Between a master plate and a spacer there is a glue layer. Each glue layer should accommodate different thicknesses of master plates and spacers in the range of their tolerances.

It seems reasonable to assume that actual thickness dimensions of master plates and spacers are normally distributed about their nominal dimensions. This leads to the prediction that the corresponding distribution representing thicknesses of premodules, without glue layers, is as well normal [1] with mean equal to

\[t=34(t_{1}+t_{2}),\]

and variance equal to

\[\sigma^{2}=34(\sigma_{1}^{2}+\sigma_{2}^{2}),\]

where

\(t_{1}\) - the nominal thickness of a master plate,\(t_{2}\) - the nominal thickness of a spacer,

\(\sigma_{1}^{2}\) - variance of thickness distribution of master plates,

\(\sigma_{2}^{2}\) - variance of thickness distribution of spacers.

The standard deviation of the sum of \(n\) random variables is the square root of the of the squares of the individual standard deviation. Thus, assuming that there are no glue layers, the thickness tolerance of the premodule may be defined as the square root of the sum of the squares of the individual part tolerances. It means, if the assembly is to be made up of 68 parts with equal tolerances, the statistical approach allows to write the following equation

\[tol_{p}=\sqrt{68}\cdot tol,\]

where

\(tol_{p}\) - the tickness tolerance of the premodule,

\(tol\) - the thickness tolerance of a master plate or spacer.

Now, assuming that \(tol=\pm 50\,\mu m\), we get

\[tol_{p}=\pm 412\,\mu m,\]

or, in the other words, the tolerance zone is equal to \(824\,\mu m\).

Since we want to have the same thickness of all premodules, glue layers should accommodate differences in thicknesses in the range of this tolerance zone. Because there is 67 glue layers, we have

\[\frac{824\,\mu m}{67}=12\,\mu m.\]

It means that in two various premodules made up of perfectly flat master plates and spacers, the thickness of glue layers should not differ more than \(12\,\mu m\), assuming that \(tol=\pm 50\,\mu m\). In order, to achieve this goal, we need to have possibility of reduction the premodule thickness, at least \(824\,\mu m\), when it is pressed by the glueing tool. According to the report [2] on results of the last test of glueing a \(180\,mm\) thick premodule, the mean value of difference of the premodule thickness before pressing and after pressing was about \(1.4\,mm\). For a \(306\,mm\) high stack this value should be about \(2.4\,mm\). The last value is about 3 times bigger than a needed one, that is, \(824\,\mu m\).

The above-mentioned facts allow to draw the conclusion that the final tolerance of the premodule thickness is defined by the dimension precision of the assembly tool and its deformation during stacking.

It seems that the problem of controlling the minimal thickness of glue layer could be solved by punching some small holes which can increase the thickness of a plate in a very small region. An another method which could be applied is to insert additional elements between plates which would keep the appropriate distance. These both methods should be checked experimentally.

### 1.2 Tolerances in plane of master plate or spacer

As can be seen in Fig.1 a tolerance zone for the width of key slots is of \(0.200\,mm\). The position of the symmetry axis in the direction perpendicular to this line can be established with the precision of \(0.100\,mm\) (see Fig.1).

It means that, if we keep one side surface of the key slot at one location,

Figure 1: Some tolerance features of master plates.

the position of the symmetry axes of all master plates in a stack are in the tolerance zone of \(0.100\,mm\). This should be applied to two key slots at the both ends of each master plate. In order to establish the position of master plates in the radial direction, the reference surface of the key slot should be perpendicular to the symmetry axis. If this surface is leaning to one side or the other not more than \(0.100\,mm\) (see Fig.1), the position of all master plates in the radial direction is established also with the precision of \(0.100\,mm\).

The outer dimensions of a master plate are defined as a distance from the reference surface REF2 (see Fig.1). Tolerances for these dimensions are equal to \(\pm 0.100\,mm\). Therefore, the side surfaces of master plates in a stack are in the distance not bigger than \(0.200\,mm\) (see Fig.2).

The position of holes in master plates is established by the position tolerance (see Fig.1). A value of \(0.100\,mm\) is applied to all the hole position in relation to each other and as well in relation to the reference surfaces REF1 and REF2 (see Fig.1). Since the reference surface REF1 may deviate from the exact position no more than \(0.100\,mm\), the position of two holes in relation to each other and belonging to two different master plates can be established with the position precision equal to \(0.200\,mm\) (see Fig.3).

The position tolerance for the holes of spacers in relation to each other are the same as for the master plate holes, it means, they are established with the position precision of \(0.100\,mm\).

It should be noted that the same reference surfaces will be used at several stages, that is, starting from manufacturing master plates, then assembling the premodule and finally assembling the module.

## 2 Tolerances of the assembly tool

Dimension tolerances of the premodule are not only defined by tolerancing of master plates and spacers but also by tolerancing of the assembly tool.

An important feature of the assembling tool are the keys. Two surfaces of these keys should be perpendicular to the table surface. Assuming that each of the keys surfaces is leaning to one side or the other not more than \(0.050\,mm\) the position in the both direction of each master plate in the stack can be established with the same precision. To achieve this goal the keys with additional elements to block each master plate separately has to be used (see Fig.4). It should be noticed that using these keys, first the position at the inner radius key together with the radial position of a master plate is to be established and then the position at the outer radius key. Flatness of the assembly tool table and the top plate should not be worse than \(\pm 0.050\,mm\). The length tolerance of elements used for establishing the height of the stack should not be worse than \(\pm 0.025\,mm\). To avoid deformations of the assembly tool, the top plate of the pressing system should be connected with the bottom table through as many elements as possible. Moreover, the pressure to which the top plate is subjected should be well-distributed. It seems that for such a pressing system deformations of the assembly tool should be negligible.

## 3 Tolerances of the premodule

The final tolerances of the premodule are the following. The total tolerance for the premodule thickness is equal to \(\pm 0.125\,mm\). It is a sum of the flatness tolerance of the table (\(\pm 0.050\,mm\)) and the top plate (\(\pm 0.050\,mm\)) and

Figure 3: Relative positions of holes in two master plates.

also the tolerance of the elements which establish the height of the stack (\(\pm 0.025\,mm\)). All remaining tolerances of the premodule are shown in Fig.5. All of them are equal to \(\pm 0.125\,mm\) except for the right side surfaces of the both key slot which have tolerances equal to \(\pm 0.025\,mm\) (see Fig.5). In addition, the surface perpendicular to the symmetry axis of the outer key slot has a tolerance equal to \(\pm 0.075\,mm\). These two surfaces should be used as reference surfaces for the further assembly process.
