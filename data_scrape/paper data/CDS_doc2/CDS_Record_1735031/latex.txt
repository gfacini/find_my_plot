The reach at the high-luminosity phase of the LHC is expected to significantly extend beyond the current limits. This document presents example benchmark studies for gluino pair production, first and second generation squark production, bottom squark pair production and chargino-neutralino production with a parameterised simulation of the ATLAS detector at a centre-of-mass energy of 14 TeV. Results are shown for an integrated luminosity of 300 and 3000 fb\({}^{-1}\).

Introduction

Supersymmetry (SUSY) [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9] proposes for every boson (fermion) of the Standard Model (SM) there exists a fermionic (bosonic) partner. SUSY particles with masses at the electroweak scale can cancel quadratic divergences to the Higgs mass corrections. SUSY can also accommodate the unification of the gauge interactions and a radiative breaking of the electroweak symmetry. Under the conservation of \(R\)-parity, the lightest SUSY particle (LSP) is stable and is an excellent candidate for the dark matter in the universe. Furthermore, the minimal supersymmetric model (MSSM) requires a Higgs boson with mass below \(\sim\)135  which could be consistent with the recently observed Higgs-like resonance [10, 11]. The discovery (or exclusion) of weak-scale SUSY is one of the highest physics priorities for the current and future LHC, including the high luminosity upgrade, HL-LHC (\(\sqrt{s}=\)14 TeV; 3000 fb\({}^{-1}\)). The multi-TeV energy range probed with the LHC and the HL-LHC will not be accessible at any other current facility.

This note shows comparisons of the discovery and exclusion reach of \(\sim\)300 fb\({}^{-1}\) LHC and a \(\sim\)3000 fb\({}^{-1}\) HL-LHC, both with \(\sqrt{s}\)=14 TeV \(pp\) collisions for some benchmark \(R\)-parity conserving SUSY analyses.

### The LHC and HL-LHC

In 2012, the LHC delivered 22.8 fb\({}^{-1}\) of proton-proton collisions at a centre-of-mass-energy of 8 TeV. During the shutdown following the end of data-taking (LS1), the machine will be consolidated to be able to operate at a centre-of-mass-energy of 13 TeV, with the possibility of future 14 TeV collisions. In the following data taking period, lasting until the end of 2017, the LHC will collect \(\sim\)100 fb\({}^{-1}\). A second long shutdown (LS2) will take place starting in 2018, during which the injection chain is foreseen to be modified to allow for instantaneous luminosities up to \(\sim\)2\(\times\)10\({}^{34}\) cm\({}^{-2}\)s\({}^{-1}\). The maximum average number of pile up events per bunch crossing is expected to be \(\langle\mu\rangle\sim 60\) and the data collected from up to 2022 will amount to \(\sim\)300 fb\({}^{-1}\). Around 2022, the accelerator is foreseen to be upgraded to the HL-LHC which will be able to achieve luminosities of \(\sim\)5\(\times\)10\({}^{34}\) cm\({}^{-2}\)s\({}^{-1}\) (LS3). The HL-LHC is expected to deliver an average number of pile up events per bunch crossing of \(\langle\mu\rangle\sim 140\) and the data collected from 2025 until 2032 will amount to \(\sim\)3000 fb\({}^{-1}\). The increased pile up degrades the ability to reconstruct quantities like missing transverse momentum and therefore event numbers do not scale simply with integrated luminosity.

### The ATLAS experiment

ATLAS [12] is a multipurpose particle physics detector with a forward-backward symmetric cylindrical geometry and nearly \(4\pi\) coverage in solid angle.1 The layout of the detector is dominated by four superconducting magnet systems, which comprise a thin solenoid surrounding inner tracking detectors (ID) with \(|\eta|<2.5\) and three large toroids supporting a large muon tracker (MS). The MS covers a range of \(|\eta|<2.7\) for precision measurements and \(|\eta|<2.4\) for triggering purposes. In the pseudorapidity region \(|\eta|<3.2\), high-granularity liquid-argon (LAr) electromagnetic (EM) sampling calorimeters surround the solenoid magnet. An iron-scintillator tile calorimeter provides hadronic coverage over \(|\eta|<1.7\). The end-cap and forward regions, spanning \(1.5<|\eta|<4.9\), are instrumented with a LAr calorimeters for both EM and hadronic measurements. Upgrades to the detector and the triggering system are planned to adapt the experiment to the increasing instantaneous and integrated lumionosity expected with the HL-LHC.

Footnote 1: ATLAS uses a right-handed coordinate system with its origin at the nominal interaction point in the centre of the detector and the \(z\)-axis along the beam pipe. Cylindrical coordinates (\(r,\phi\)) are used in the transverse plane, \(\phi\) being the azimuthal angle around the beam pipe. The pseudorapidity \(\eta\) is defined in terms of the polar angle \(\theta\) by \(\eta=-\ln\tan(\theta/2)\).

Searches for \(R\)-parity conserving SUSY

### SUSY searches at the LHC

In the framework of generic \(R\)-parity conserving supersymmetric extensions of the SM, SUSY particles are produced in pairs and the LSP is stable. In a large fraction of the parameter space, the LSP is the lightest neutralino, where neutralinos (\(\tilde{\chi}^{0}_{j}\), \(j=1,2,3,4\)) and charginos (\(\tilde{\chi}^{\pm}_{i}\), \(i=1,2\)) are the mass eigenstates originating from the superposition of the SUSY partners of Higgs and electroweak gauge bosons (higgsinos and electroweak gauginos). The scalar partners of right-handed and left-handed fermions can mix to form two mass eigenstates, nearly degenerate in the case of first and second generation squarks and sleptons (\(\tilde{q}\) and \(\tilde{l}\)), whilst possibly split in the case of bottom and top squarks (sbottom, \(\tilde{b}\) and stop, \(\tilde{t}\)) and tau sleptons (stau, \(\tilde{\tau}\)). The lighter top squark mass eigenstate can be significantly lighter than the other squarks and the gluinos (\(\tilde{g}\), supersymmetric partners of the gluons).

Supersymmetry searches in the initial phases of the LHC (in particular those corresponding to the 35 pb\({}^{-1}\) and the 1 fb\({}^{-1}\) datasets) targeted processes with large expected cross-section, such as production of gluinos and first, second generation squarks (Fig. 1). As the integrated luminosity increased, the search strategy was refined to access processes with either smaller cross-section or a-priori lower sensitivity.

The ATLAS Collaboration is currently carrying out a broad programme of searches [13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21] including searches for light-flavour squarks and gluinos, weakly produced sparticles, and third generation squarks. Results from the searches mentioned above have excluded first and second generation squark and gluino masses below about 850 GeV and 1330 GeV, respectively, under the assumption of a simplified model and a very light LSP [22]. Less stringent limits are placed on third generation squarks [17], charginos and neutralinos [20] and sleptons [19]. The mass constraints strongly depend on the assumed SUSY mass spectrum.

Figure 1: Next-to-leading order cross-sections for the production of supersymmetric particles at the LHC as a function of the average mass of the pair-produced supersymmetric particles. The \(\tilde{\chi}^{\pm}_{1}\) and \(\tilde{\chi}^{0}_{2}\) are assumed to be wino-like. Cross-sections for bottom squark pair production are equal to those of top squark pair production.. The squark cross-sections are shown for decoupled gluinos and the gluino cross-section is shown for decoupled squarks.

### SUSY searches at the HL-LHC

If a signal of new physics is found at the LHC, the HL-LHC will be essential to determine the properties of the underlying physics and a large programme of measurements would be undertaken. This note focuses on the discovery and exclusion reach of the LHC and HL-LHC for a few illustrative examples.

Previous studies of the discovery and exclusion reach of the HL-LHC have been carried out for squark and gluino production, for the production of top squarks and for the production of charginos and neutralinos [23, 24]. This note updates the searches for gluino pair production, bottom squark pair production and searches for charginos and neutralinos with improved parametrizations of the upgraded ATLAS detector configurations, re-optimized selections and an improved estimation of all the relevant background processes. The following analyses are developed for this note:

* search for the direct production of a neutralino and a chargino with the decay to a \(W\) or \(Z\) boson and the LSP,
* search for the direct production of a neutralino and a chargino with the decay to a \(W\) or Higgs boson and the LSP,
* search for the direct production of gluinos,
* search for the direct production of first and second generation squarks,
* search for the direct production of bottom squarks,

under the assumptions of:

* 300 fb\({}^{-1}\) at \(\sqrt{s}\)= 14 TeV and \(\langle\mu\rangle\sim\) 60 (LHC)
* 3000 fb\({}^{-1}\) at \(\sqrt{s}\)= 14 TeV and \(\langle\mu\rangle\sim\) 140 (HL-LHC).

For these analyses, Monte Carlo generator level information is used for both the background and the signal processes. The detector response is a parameterisation based on existing data samples and full high pile-up Monte Carlo simulations of the upgraded detector, as described in Refs. [25, 26]. The parameterizations describe the resolution and the reconstruction efficiencies of electrons, muons, tau-leptons, photons, jets, \(b\)-jets and missing transverse momentum. The mis-identification of \(c\)-jets and light flavour jets as \(b\)-jets is accounted for in the parametrizations. The parameterised response functions account for the effect of the number of interactions per bunch crossing ranging between 60 and 140 with 25ns bunch spacing. The effect of the trigger is not taken into account in these analyses, but planned upgrades to the detector are expected to allow lepton and missing energy triggers that would have high efficiency for the studied scenarios with respect to the analysis selections.

### Monte Carlo Generation

Several Monte Carlo (MC) generators are used to model the dominant SM processes and new physics signals relevant for the analyses. Sherpa-1.4.1 [27] is used to simulate the top pair, diboson \(W\)Z\({}^{(*)}\), \(W^{(*)}\)+jets, and \(Z^{(*)}\)+jets processes. The Sherpa \(W^{(*)}\)+jets and \(Z^{(*)}\)+jets processes were generated with massive \(b\), \(c\) quarks. Additional dedicated Alpgen-2.14 [28] samples are used for the \(W^{(*)}\)+jets, and \(Z^{(*)}\)+jets processes in the search for chargino and neutralino associated production. The processes \(ZZ^{(*)}\) and \(Wh\) are generated with Pythia-8.165 [29]. The generator MadGraph-5.0 [30] is used for the production of \(t\bar{t}V\) (\(V=W,Z\)) events and the production of \(WWW\), \(ZZZ\) and \(ZWW\) events (collectively referred to as 'triboson' or \(VVV\) in this note). Single top production is generated with AcerMC [31] for the \(t\)-channel, and Powheg[32]+Pythia for the \(Wt\) and \(s\)-channel. The top-quark pair-production contributionis normalised to approximate next-to-next-to-leading-order calculations (NNLO) [33]. The expected diboson yields are normalised to the Sherpa or MCFM predictions in the case of the Pythia samples. The NNLO FEWZ [34, 35] cross-sections are used for normalisation of the inclusive \(W\)+light-flavour jets and \(Z\)+light-flavour jets. The expected triboson and \(ttV\) yields are normalized to NLO. The CTEQ6L1 [36] parton distribution functions (PDFs) are used with MadGraph and the CT10 [37] PDFs with MC@NLO and Sherpa.

The signal MC samples are produced with Herwig++2.5.2 [38], or MadGraph-5.0 for gluino pair production and bottom squark pair production. The yields are normalized to the NLO cross-section calculated with Prospino2 [39] in the case of electro-weakino production. They are normalized to NLO+NLL accuracy [40] for gluino, squark and sbottom production. The most relevant MC samples have equivalent luminosity (at 14 TeV) of at least 1000 fb\({}^{-1}\).

### Expected Sensitivity

For the analyses discussed in this document, limits are set using a significance-like variable, referred to as \(Z_{N}\)[41], which takes into account the systematic uncertainties on the background. The value of \(Z_{N}\) is required to be larger than 5 for discovery and larger than 1.64 for 95% CL exclusion 2.

Footnote 2: A one sided confidence interval is used. Comparing the used prescription with a dedicated 95%CL exclusion test yields very similar results.

The most important sources of experimental systematic uncertainties are due to the energy resolution and scale uncertainty of jets, leptons and \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\); \(b\)-tagging efficiency; and the pile-up. For the electroweak and third generation (strong) SUSY studies at 14 TeV a coarse systematic uncertainty of 30% (10%) on the estimated sum of all backgrounds is assumed, which is consistent with the uncertainties found in published searches. The projection studies assume conservatively that the uncertainties determined for the 8 TeV analysis hold for the HL-LHC. Theoretical uncertainties on the SUSY yields due to the choice of renormalization and factorization scales and PDF have only been estimated for the strong production processes where they have a large impact at very high gluino mass. Theoretical uncertainties on the SUSY signal are not seen to have large effects on the limits for chargino-neutralino production or sbottom pair production. Experimental uncertainties on the SUSY yields have not been considered.

## 3 Search for the direct production of charginos and neutralinos

Based on naturalness arguments the \(\tilde{\mathcal{X}}_{1}^{\pm},\tilde{\mathcal{X}}_{2}^{0}\), and \(\tilde{\mathcal{X}}_{1}^{0}\) are expected to have masses in the hundreds of GeV range [42, 43] and are potentially within reach of the LHC. As seen in Figure 1, the cross-section of \(\tilde{\mathcal{X}}_{1}^{\pm}\tilde{\mathcal{X}}_{2}^{0}\) associated production ranges from 1000 to 1 fb for masses between 200 and 600 GeV and can dominate the SUSY production in scenarios with heavy squarks and gluinos. In this study, both \(\tilde{\mathcal{X}}_{1}^{\pm}\) and \(\tilde{\mathcal{X}}_{2}^{0}\) are assumed to be wino-like, while the \(\tilde{\mathcal{X}}_{1}^{0}\) is bino-like. The \(\tilde{\mathcal{X}}_{1}^{\pm}\) and \(\tilde{\mathcal{X}}_{2}^{0}\) mass is assumed to be equal. Two simplified models of direct production of \(\tilde{\mathcal{X}}_{1}^{\pm}\) and \(\tilde{\mathcal{X}}_{2}^{0}\) are studied in this note,

\(WZ\)**-mediated:**: all sleptons and sneutrinos are assumed to be heavy, and the \(\tilde{\mathcal{X}}_{1}^{\pm}\) and \(\tilde{\mathcal{X}}_{2}^{0}\) decay via \(W^{(*)}\) and \(Z^{(*)}\) bosons, respectively, with a branching fraction of 100%,
**Wh-mediated:**: all sleptons and sneutrinos are assumed to be heavy, and the \(\tilde{\mathcal{X}}_{1}^{\pm}\) and \(\tilde{\mathcal{X}}_{2}^{0}\) decay via \(W\) and lightest Higgs bosons, respectively, with a branching fraction of 100%. The Higgs boson considered is SM-like, with a mass of 125 GeV and is assumed to decay with SM branching ratios. Two final states are studied for this scenario, depending on the Higgs decay: the first where the Higgs decays to two \(e\), \(\mu\) via intermediate \(\tau\tau\), \(WW\) or \(ZZ\) states, and the second where the Higgs decays to two hadronically decaying taus.

The final states can contain three leptons/taus and missing transverse momentum as shown in Figure 2. It should be noted that the \(WZ\)-mediated scenario with 100% branching fraction is not realistic for large \(m_{\tilde{\chi}^{0}_{1}}-m_{\tilde{\chi}^{0}_{1}}>m_{h}\), however, the limits would fall somewhere between those achieved for the \(WZ\)-mediated and \(Wh\)-mediated scenarios for the same production cross-section.

Two final states are considered for the \(\tilde{\chi}^{\pm}_{1}\tilde{\chi}^{0}_{2}\) simplified models studied in this note. The \(\tilde{\chi}^{\pm}_{1}\) is assumed to decay as \(\tilde{\chi}^{\pm}_{1}\to W^{\pm(*)}\tilde{\chi}^{0}_{1}\) and the \(\tilde{\chi}^{0}_{2}\) either as \(\tilde{\chi}^{0}_{2}\to Z^{(*)}\tilde{\chi}^{0}_{1}\) or \(\tilde{\chi}^{0}_{2}\to h^{(*)}\tilde{\chi}^{0}_{1}\) with 100% branching ratio. Two final states are studied for the \(Wh\)-mediated scenario: \(3\ell\) and \(1\ell 2\tau\). The dots in (b) depict possible additional decay products of the lightest Higgs boson decaying via intermediate \(\tau\tau\), \(WW\) or \(ZZ\) states.

Two final states are considered for the \(\tilde{\chi}^{\pm}_{1}\tilde{\chi}^{0}_{2}\) simplified models studied in this note,

**Three leptons (\(3\ell\)):**: where leptons (\(\ell\)) refers to electrons and muons including those from the \(\tau\)-lepton decays but do not include hadronically-decaying \(\tau\)-leptons. This final state targets both the \(WZ\)-mediated and \(Wh\)-mediated simplified models.
**One lepton + two \(\tau\) (\(1\ell 2\tau\)):**: where the one lepton (\(\ell\)) plus two hadronically decaying taus (\(\tau\)) signature is used to target the \(Wh\)-mediated simplified model.

The background for a signal with \(3\ell\) or \(1\ell 2\tau\) and large \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\) is dominated by the irreducible processes \(WZ^{(*)}\), tribosons and \(t\bar{t}+Z/W\). The assumed systematic uncertainty of 30% on the estimated sum of all backgrounds is expected to hold under the hypothesis that the theoretical uncertainty on the triboson backgrounds is at the level of that of the diboson backgrounds for 14 TeV. The reducible process \(t\bar{t}\) is also an important background, producing two prompt leptons from the \(W\) decays and a third when one of the \(b\)-quarks in the event decays semileptonically and is mis-identified as a prompt, isolated lepton. In the \(1\ell 2\tau\) channel, the reducible processes \(t\bar{t}\), \(W\)+jets, \(Z\)+jets are important backgrounds where jets are mis-identified as taus.

### \(Wz\)-mediated Signal Region Selection

Candidate leptons are selected with \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) larger than 10 GeV and \(|\eta|\!<\!2.47\) (2.4) for electrons (muons). Candidate jets are selected with the anti-\(k_{t}\) algorithm with a radius parameter of \(\Delta R\equiv\sqrt{(\Delta\phi)^{2}+(\Delta\eta)^{2}}\!=\!0.4\), with \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\!>\!20\) GeV and \(|\eta|\!<\!2.5\). Jets are required to be separated from candidate electrons with \(\Delta R(e,\,jet)>0.2\). Jets are tagged as originating from \(b\)-decays, "\(b\)-tagged jets", with the chosen working point of the \(b\)-tagging algorithm correctly identifying \(b\)-quark jets in simulated \(t\bar{t}\) samples with an average efficiency of 70%, with a light-flavour jet misidentification probability of about 1% (parametrised as a function of jet \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) and \(\eta\)).

Leptons forming low mass Same-Flavour Opposite-Sign (SFOS) lepton pairs (invariant mass \(m_{\mathrm{SFOS}}<12\) GeV) are discarded to remove leptons from low-mass resonances. Leptons are required to be isolated by imposing that the scalar sum of the transverse momenta of tracks with \(p_{\rm T}\!>\!1\) GeV and within a cone of \(\Delta R\!=\!0.3\) around the lepton candidate, excluding the lepton candidate track itself, be less than 15% of the lepton \(p_{\rm T}\).

Leptons originating from \(b\)-quark decays have an additional suppression factor imposed of 0.0625 to describe the effect of impact parameter requirements (based on full simulation studies performed at 8 TeV). The limits achieved here are not sensitive to the suppression factor being varied between one-half and twice its nominal value, as the \(t\bar{t}\) background in the dominant signal regions is suppressed by other selections. All leptons are requested to be separated from each other (leptons with \(\Delta R(\ell,\ell^{\prime})<0.1\) are discarded) and from surviving jets (leptons with \(\Delta R(\ell,\,jet)<0.4\) are discarded). The latter requirement is imposed to suppress the background from semi-leptonic decays of heavy-flavor quarks.

Events are selected with exactly three leptons and a SFOS lepton pair is required to be present among the three leptons. Events with \(b\)-tagged jets are vetoed to suppress \(t\bar{t}\) and \(t\bar{t}+V\) backgrounds. Events are required to include at least one \(Z\) boson candidate, defined as a SFOS lepton pair with mass \(|m_{\rm SFOS}-m_{\rm Z}|<10\) GeV. The \(WZ\) and \(t\bar{t}\) samples are generated with a \(E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}>50\) GeV filter, and so a requirement of \(E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}>100\) GeV is imposed after smearing. The three leptons are required to have high \(p_{\rm T}\), and large \(E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}\) and \(m_{\rm T}\) requirements are made to define four signal regions as seen in Table 1, where the \(m_{\rm T}\) is constructed from the lepton not forming the SFOS pair with invariant mass closest to the \(Z\) boson mass.

The \(p_{\rm T}\) of the third leptons for the 300 fb\({}^{-1}\) scenario is shown in Figure 3(a), where it is seen raising the \(p_{\rm T}\) threshold of the leptons to 50 GeV suppresses the \(t\bar{t}\) and \(Z\)+jets backgrounds. The same \(p_{\rm T}\) threshold is also seen to be beneficial in the 3000 fb\({}^{-1}\) scenario. The \(E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}\) distributions after the lepton \(p_{\rm T}\) requirements are applied is shown in Figure 3(b) for the 300 fb\({}^{-1}\) scenario, where the signal is seen to have large \(E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}\) compared to the SM backgrounds.

Three signal regions are defined for the 300 fb\({}^{-1}\) scenario: a looser region "A" optimised for discovery, and two tighter regions "B" and "C" optimised for exclusion. For the 3000 fb\({}^{-1}\) scenario, one additional tight signal region, "D" is defined to improve the sensitivity to high mass scenarios.

Figure 3: For the 300 fb\({}^{-1}\) scenario, the distibution of the (a) third lepton in three-lepton events with a SFOS lepton pair, a \(Z\) boson candidate, a \(b\)-jet veto and \(E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}>100\) GeV and (b) \(E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}\) where lepton \(p_{T}(1,2,3)>50\) GeV is also applied. The figure shows signal model lines for \(\tilde{\chi}_{1}^{\pm}\tilde{\chi}_{2}^{0}\) production with different mass assumptions for the \(\tilde{\chi}_{1}^{\pm}\),\(\tilde{\chi}_{2}^{0}\) and \(\tilde{\chi}_{1}^{0}\). The black arrows show the selection values for the 300 fb\({}^{-1}\) signal regions. Spikes in the distributions are due to SM samples with relative low luminosity and high weights.

### \(Wz\)-mediated Expected Sensitivity

The number of events for the SM background and four SUSY scenarios can be seen in Table 2 for the \(300\,\mathrm{fb}^{-1}\) and \(3000\,\mathrm{fb}^{-1}\) signal regions. The SM background is dominated by \(WZ\) production in all signal regions, followed by small contributions from \(ZWW\), \(ZZW\) and \(t\bar{t}\mathrm{Z}\) production. SM backgrounds with at least one mis-identified or non-prompt lepton (\(t\bar{t}\) and \(Z\)+jets) are completely suppressed in this study by the tight signal regions requirements.

The signal significances from the \(WZ\)-mediated signal regions are combined in quadrature for each of the two luminosities considered. For \(WZ\)-mediated signals, the combination is performed using disjoint versions of SRA-C (SRA-D) for the \(300\,\mathrm{fb}^{-1}\) (\(3000\,\mathrm{fb}^{-1}\)) luminosity scenario. The disjoint regions are defined by imposing upper \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\) and \(m_{\mathrm{T}}\) bounds on the looser regions to prevent overlap with the tighter regions, e.g. SRA is additionally required to have \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}<300\) GeV or \(m_{\mathrm{T}}<200\) GeV to prevent overlap with SRB.

fied models can be seen in Figure 4. In the case of the \(WZ\)-mediated simplified models and the luminosity scenario of 300 fb\({}^{-1}\), the exclusion contour reaches 840 GeV in \(\tilde{\chi}_{1}^{\pm},\tilde{\chi}_{2}^{0}\) mass, while for the high luminosity scenario with 3000 fb\({}^{-1}\), the contour extends as far as 1.1 TeV in \(\tilde{\chi}_{1}^{\pm},\tilde{\chi}_{2}^{0}\) mass. The discovery contour for 300 fb\({}^{-1}\) reaches 560 GeV in \(\tilde{\chi}_{1}^{\pm},\tilde{\chi}_{2}^{0}\) mass, and 820 GeV for the high luminosity scenario with 3000 fb\({}^{-1}\).

### \(3\ell\)\(Wh\)-mediated Signal Region Selection

Leptons are selected as in Section 3.1. Events are selected with exactly three leptons and events with a Same-Flavour Opposite-Sign (SFOS) lepton pair present among the three leptons are rejected to suppress the \(WZ\) background. This SFOS veto mainly selects \(Wh\)-mediated \(\tilde{\chi}_{1}^{\pm}\tilde{\chi}_{2}^{0}\) signal events where the \(h\!\rightarrow\!WW\). Events with \(b\)-tagged jets are vetoed to suppress \(t\bar{t}\) and \(t\bar{t}+V\) backgrounds. The \(WZ\) and \(t\bar{t}\) samples are generated with a \(E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}>50\) GeV filter, and so a requirement of \(E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}>100\) GeV is imposed after smearing. A requirement is made on the invariant mass of the two OS leptons closest in \(\Delta R\), \(m_{\rm OS}^{minAR}\), to reject the \(t\bar{t}\) and \(WWW\) backgrounds. Large \(m_{\rm T}\) formed from each of the three leptons, \(m_{\rm T}(\ell_{1})\), \(m_{\rm T}(\ell_{2})\) and \(m_{\rm T}(\ell_{3})\), is required to reduce the contributions from the \(t\bar{t}\) and triboson backgrounds. The thresholds on \(m_{\rm OS}^{\minAR}\), \(m_{\rm T}(\ell_{1})\), \(m_{\rm T}(\ell_{2})\) and \(m_{\rm T}(\ell_{3})\) are optimised for high \(Z_{N}\). Four signal regions are defined for the \(Wh\)-mediated simplified model: two loose regions "E" and "F" optimised for small mass splitting scenarios, a tight region "G" optimised for large mass splitting scenarios, and a very tight region "H" optimised for large mass splittings in the 3000 fb\({}^{-1}\) scenario, and these are summarised in Table 3.

### \(1\ell 2\tau\)\(Wh\)-mediated Signal Region Selection

Leptons and jets are selected as in Section 3.1. Candidate taus are selected with \(p_{\rm T}\) larger than 20 GeV and \(|\eta|<2.47\). All taus are requested to be separated from candidate jets (jets are discarded if \(\Delta R(\tau,\,jet)<0.2\)) and leptons (taus are discarded if \(\Delta R(\tau,\ell)<0.2\)). Due to limited statistics in some MC samples, MC events are used 10 times with different seeds used for the reconstruction parametrisation. The events are then weighted by 1/10 to account for this effect.

Figure 4: The expected 95% exclusion and discovery contours for the 300 fb\({}^{-1}\) and 3000 fb\({}^{-1}\) luminosity scenarios in the \(m(\tilde{\chi}_{1}^{0})\) vs \(m(\tilde{\chi}_{1}^{\pm},\tilde{\chi}_{2}^{0})\) plane for the \(WZ\)-mediated simplified model. The 8 TeV exclusion contour is also shown in orange [19].

Events are selected with exactly one lepton with \(p_{\rm T}\) larger than 25 GeV and an Opposite Sign (OS) tau pair. Events with \(b\)-tagged jets are vetoed to suppress \(t\bar{t}\) and \(t\bar{t}+V\) backgrounds. The \(t\bar{t}\) samples decaying to taus are generated with a \(E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}>120\) GeV filter, and so a requirement of \(E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}>250\) GeV is imposed after smearing.

A signal region for the 3000 fb\({}^{-1}\) luminosity scenario is defined in Table 4, where the tau pair invariant mass \(m_{\tau\tau}\) is required to be 80-130 GeV consistent with a \(h\)\(\rightarrow\)\(\tau\tau\) decay. In addition to a \(b\)-jet veto and a large \(E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}\) requirement, the scalar sum of the \(p_{\rm T}\) of the two taus is also required to be high to reject most SM backgrounds. Finally, the transverse mass (using the lepton and \(E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}\)) is required to be large to suppress SM processes with \(W\)\(\rightarrow\)\(\ell\nu\) decays.

### \(Wh\)-mediated Expected Sensitivity

The number of events for the SM background and four SUSY scenarios can be seen in Table 5 for the 300 fb\({}^{-1}\) and 3000 fb\({}^{-1}\)\(3\ell\) signal regions. The SM background is dominated by \(WWW\) and \(t\bar{t}\) production in both signal regions, followed by smaller contributions from \(Wh\), \(t\bar{t}W\), \(ZWW\) and \(WZ\) production. SM backgrounds with a \(Z\) boson are almost completely suppressed in this study by the SFOS lepton veto. In

The looser “E” and “F” signal regions are optimised for small mass splitting scenarios, the tight “G” region for larger mass splittings and the very tight “H” region for large mass splittings for the 3000 fb\({}^{-1}\) scenario only.

the tightest signal region for each luminosity scenario, \(t\bar{t}\) is completely suppressed.

The number of events for the SM background and four SUSY scenarios can be seen in Table 6 for the \(3000\,\mathrm{fb}^{-1}\)\(1\ell 2\tau\) signal region. The SM background is dominated by \(t\bar{t}\), \(WW\) and \(WZ\) production, followed by smaller contributions from \(W\)+jets, tribosons and \(t\bar{t}+V\). The SM processes \(Wh\), \(ZZ\), \(Z\)+ jets are suppressed to negligible levels by the signal region requirements.

The signal significances from the \(Wh\)-mediated \(3\ell\) signal regions are combined in quadrature for each of the two luminosities considered. The combination is performed using disjoint versions of SRE-G (SRE-H) for the \(300\,\mathrm{fb}^{-1}\) (\(3000\,\mathrm{fb}^{-1}\)) luminosity scenario. The disjoint regions are defined by imposing upper \(m_{\mathrm{T}}(\ell_{1,2,3})\) bounds on the looser regions to prevent overlap with the tighter regions, e.g. SRE is additionally required to have \(m_{\mathrm{T}}(\ell_{2})<150\) GeV to prevent overlap with SRF.

The 95% exclusion and \(5\sigma\) discovery contours that would be expected for the the \(Wh\)-mediated simplified models can be seen in Figure 5 using the \(3\ell\) and \(1\ell 2\tau\) channels. The shape of the contours is dominated by the tightest signal regions, SRG and SGH. In the case of the \(3\ell\) channel, the exclusion

contour reaches \(650\,\mathrm{GeV}\) in \(\tilde{\chi}^{\pm}_{1},\tilde{\chi}^{0}_{2}\) mass for the \(300\,\mathrm{fb}^{-1}\) scenario, and \(940\,\mathrm{GeV}\) in \(\tilde{\chi}^{\pm}_{1},\tilde{\chi}^{0}_{2}\) mass for the \(3000\,\mathrm{fb}^{-1}\) scenario. The discovery contour for \(3000\,\mathrm{fb}^{-1}\) reaches \(650\,\mathrm{GeV}\) in \(\tilde{\chi}^{\pm}_{1},\tilde{\chi}^{0}_{2}\) mass, however, a discovery contour is not achieved for the \(300\,\mathrm{fb}^{-1}\) scenario. For the \(8\,\mathrm{TeV}\) analysis, the exclusion contour reaches \(150\,\mathrm{GeV}\) in \(\tilde{\chi}^{\pm}_{1},\tilde{\chi}^{0}_{2}\) mass and \(17\,\mathrm{GeV}\) in \(\tilde{\chi}^{0}_{1}\) mass [20].

In the case of the \(1\ell 2\tau\) channel, the exclusion contour reaches \(550\,\mathrm{GeV}\) in \(\tilde{\chi}^{\pm}_{1},\tilde{\chi}^{0}_{2}\) mass for the \(3000\,\mathrm{fb}^{-1}\) scenario. An exclusion contour for \(300\,\mathrm{fb}^{-1}\) is not achieved, neither are discovery contours for either luminosity scenario. A statistical fluctuation in the \(WW\) background sample used for the analysis leads to a conservative estimate of the \(WW\) background of 3.5 events. Using an ABCD method with the \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\) and \(|p_{T}(\tau_{1})|+|p_{T}(\tau_{2})|\) variables, the \(WW\) estimate is reduced to 0.1 events and the limits improve by about \(50\,\mathrm{GeV}\) in \(\tilde{\chi}^{\pm}_{1},\tilde{\chi}^{0}_{2}\) and \(\tilde{\chi}^{0}_{1}\) mass. Despite the weak sensitivity to \(Wh\)-mediated scenarios with \(h\to\tau\tau\) final states, the \(1\ell 2\tau\) channel gives excellent complementarity to \(3\ell\) final states.

## 4 Strongly produced supersymmetry

Strongly produced SUSY particles are expected to have the highest production cross-section of all SUSY processes, provided they are light enough to be produced at the LHC. In this study, simplified models of gluino and squark pair production are considered. The gluino decays directly into two quarks and the LSP (\(\tilde{\chi}^{0}_{1}\)) with 100% branching ratio, as shown in Figure 6. The squark decays into a quark and the LSP (\(\tilde{\chi}^{0}_{1}\)) with 100% branching ratio. In both cases signal events are characterised by many jets, large \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\) and no leptons.

### Background processes

The SM background for a signal with many jets and large \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\) is dominated by \(Z\)+jets, \(W\)+jets, \(t\bar{t}\) and diboson production. Based on \(8\,\mathrm{TeV}\) published results [22], the diboson background is set to 10% of the total of the other SM backgrounds, multijet production is assumed to be suppressed to negligible levels by dedicated signal region requirements, and the uncertainty on the total SM background is assumed to be 10%.

### Signal region selection

The signal region selection is similar to the selection in Ref. [22]. Jets are selected with \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\!>\!20\) GeV and \(|\eta|\!<\!4.5\). Between minimal two and minimal six high \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) jets are required, with no leptons present in the event. Multiple signal regions have been optimised with requirements on the effective mass \(m_{\mathrm{eff}}=E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}+\sum|p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{ jet}}|\), \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}/m_{\mathrm{eff}}\) and \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}/\sqrt{H_{\mathrm{T}}}\) (where \(H_{\mathrm{T}}\) is defined as the scalar sum of the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) of all jets). A summary of the signal regions is shown in Table 7. Harder selections on \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\) and jet \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) would need to be made to satisfy the trigger thresholds for these signal regions, however, the results are expected to be the same due to the hard \(m_{\mathrm{eff}}\) and \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}/\sqrt{H_{\mathrm{T}}}\) selections.

### Expected Sensitivity

Figure 7 shows the \(m_{\mathrm{eff}}\) distribution in the 4-jet region with \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}>160\) GeV for the Standard Model background and two SUSY signal points; one with \(m_{\tilde{g}}=1950\) GeV and \(m_{\tilde{\chi}^{0}_{1}}=1\) GeV, the other with \(m_{\tilde{g}}=1425\) GeV and \(m_{\tilde{\chi}^{0}_{1}}=1400\) GeV. For the compressed scenario, the signal distribution is similar in shape to the background, and does not extend beyond the tail of the background at high \(m_{\mathrm{eff}}\). Compressed signals are difficult to detect due to this behaviour. Figure 8 shows similar distributions for two points for squark pair production.

The number of expected events for the irreducible backgrounds and two benchmark signal points is shown in Tables 8 and 9. As in the 8 TeV analysis, the Z+jets background is dominant, with the contribution from the \(\vec{t}\) background increasing with jet multiplicity.

Figure 9 shows the expected exclusion and discovery contours. In the case of gluino pair production, the production cross-section is derived for the decoupling limit. The cross-section is not altered much if squarks are as light as a few TeV since t-channel processes are not of importance. With increasing luminosity, discovery is expected for gluino-pair production up to \(m_{\tilde{g}}~{}=~{}2000\) GeV for \(300\) fb\({}^{-1}\), and \(m_{\tilde{g}}~{}=~{}2350\) GeV for the \(3000\) fb\({}^{-1}\) luminosity scenario. Depending on the gluino mass, a \(\tilde{\chi}^{0}_{1}\) with a mass up to \(900\) GeV (\(1100\) GeV) can be discovered for the \(300\) fb\({}^{-1}\) (\(3000\) fb\({}^{-1}\)) luminosity scenario. Notably, these mass ranges lie outside any current 8 TeV exclusion limits. The theoretical uncertainty on the limit is mainly due to uncertainties in the parton-density functions and increases with gluino mass. The theoretical uncertainty reaches about 400 GeV for gluinos with a mass of \(2950\) GeV. Theoretical uncertainties on the SUSY signal are not seen to have large effects on the limits for chargino-neutralino production or sbottom pair production, however, they are seen to be important for the strong production studied here. In the event of an absence of an excess over the Standard Model expectation, gluino masses are expected to be excluded up to \(2350\) GeV (\(2950\) GeV) for the \(300\) fb\({}^{-1}\) (\(3000\) fb\({}^{-1}\)) luminosity scenario,

Figure 6: The diagram for the squark (left) and gluino (right) pair production simplified models studied in this note. The gluino is assumed to decay into \(qq\tilde{\chi}^{0}_{1}\) with 100% branching ratio and the squark is assumed to decay into \(q\tilde{\chi}^{0}_{1}\) with 100% branching ratio.

The signal regions shown are 2jm (top) and 4jl (bottom) for 300 fb\({}^{-1}\) (left) and 3000 fb\({}^{-1}\) (right). All selection cuts are applied besides those on \(m_{\rm eff}\).

assuming a massless \(\tilde{\chi}_{1}^{0}\). Depending on the gluino mass, \(\tilde{\chi}_{1}^{0}\) up to 1100 GeV (1500 GeV) can be excluded for the 300 fb\({}^{-1}\) (3000 fb\({}^{-1}\)) luminosity scenario. Such exclusion limits would extend well beyond the existing limits already set by ATLAS.

For squark-pair production two scenarios have been studied. In the first scenario, the squarks are completely decoupled from the gluino. In the second scenario, the gluino mass is set to \(m_{\tilde{g}}~{}=~{}4.5\) TeV, which is above the expected HL-LHC exclusion reach. Here, t-channel gluino exchange processes contribute and the production cross-section for heavy squarks is largely increased. The difference in selection efficiencies for these scenarios is found to be \(<30\%\) for the relevant signal regions. Since this difference has only a very small effect on the estimated limits, the same selection efficiencies are used for both scenarios.

If the gluino is extremly heavy (decoupled) squarks can be excluded up to a mass of about 2000 GeV for light neutralinos and 3000 fb\({}^{-1}\) integrated luminosity. The limit is reduced to 1850 GeV if the integrated luminosity is 300 fb\({}^{-1}\). In this scenario, squarks can be discovered up to 1400 GeV with 3000 fb\({}^{-1}\).

If the gluino is lighter, the squark reach is increased. For squark-pair production in the case where \(m_{\tilde{g}}~{}=~{}4.5\) TeV, squarks can be discovered up to a mass of 2400 GeV for 300 fb\({}^{-1}\) and 3100 GeV for 3000 fb\({}^{-1}\). Here, the exclusion reach for squarks reaches 3100 GeV for 300 fb\({}^{-1}\) and 3500 GeV for 3000 fb\({}^{-1}\) for very light neutralinos.

Table 7: Summary of selection requirements for the 300 fb\({}^{-1}\) and 3000 fb\({}^{-1}\) for the squark and gluino signal regions. The 2j, 3j and 4jl regions, targetting squark pair production, have two cuts on \(m_{\rm eff}\). The first is designed for scenarios where the gluino is decoupled, the other for the case in which the gluino mass is 4.5 TeV.

For squark pair-production, the gluino mass is either (b) decoupled or (c) set to 4.5 TeV. The bands reflect the 1\(\sigma\) uncertainty on the production cross-section. The stepping along the diagonal in the top left figure is a non-physical effect caused by the granularity of the grid.

each bottom squark decaying to \(b\tilde{\chi}^{0}_{1}\) with a 100% BR (as shown in Figure 10), was carried out at ATLAS in Run I, setting a limit of \(\sim\)650 GeV for a massless \(\tilde{\chi}^{0}_{1}\)[44]. Here, the prospects for bottom squark pair production searches at the 14 TeV LHC with 300fb\({}^{-1}\) and 3000fb\({}^{-1}\) are studied.

The strategy pursued closely follows that of the 8 TeV analysis [44]. The main variable used to discriminate the bottom squark pair signal from background is the boost-corrected contransverse mass, \(m_{\rm CT}\)[45]. For parent particles produced with small transverse boosts, \(m_{\rm CT}\) is bounded from above by an analytical combination of particle masses. This bound is saturated when the two visible objects are co-linear. For \(t\bar{t}\) events this kinematic bound is at 135 GeV. For the production of bottom squark pairs, the bound is given by:

\[m_{\rm CT}^{\rm max}=\frac{m^{2}(\bar{b})-m^{2}(\tilde{\chi}^{0}_{1})}{m(\bar {b})}. \tag{1}\]

Figure 11 shows the \(m_{\rm CT}\) distribution for bottom squark signal events for \(\langle\mu\rangle=60\). Due to the endpoint for the \(t\bar{t}\) process, the \(m_{\rm CT}\) cut is found to be very effective in suppressing this background. The dominant background is then found to be \(Z(\to\nu\nu)+b\bar{b}\), with smaller contributions from other processes such as single top, \(t\bar{t}V\) (\(V=W,Z\)) and diboson production.

### Expected sensitivity to bottom squark pair production

Signal regions described in the previous sections are considered with \(m_{\rm CT}\) thresholds of 300, 350, 450, 550, 650 and 750 GeV. Higher thresholds are not considered since the MC statistical uncertainties become dominant in the tail of the \(m_{\rm CT}\) distribution beyond 750 GeV. The systematic uncertainties for the signal regions used in the 8 TeV analysis are assumed to be unchanged. The systematic uncertainty for the signal regions with higher \(m_{\rm CT}\) thresholds (\(>400\) GeV) are assumed to be 30%. The number of expected events for the 300 fb\({}^{-1}\) luminosity scenario is shown in Table 11. The dominant backgrounds are \(Z\)+jets and single top production, with subleading contributions from \(W\)+jets and \(t\overline{t}V\).

Exclusion limits are set in the \(m_{\tilde{b}_{1}}-m_{\tilde{\chi}^{0}_{1}}\) plane using the best expected signal region. The exclusion limits are shown in Figure 13. The 5\(\sigma\) discovery curves are also shown on the same plot. Bottom squark masses up to 1400 GeV can be excluded at 95% CL with 300 fb\({}^{-1}\) of integrated luminosity, for a massles \(\tilde{\chi}^{0}_{1}\). With 3000 fb\({}^{-1}\) at the HL-LHC, the exclusion reach improves by an additional 150 GeV. Bottom squarks with masses of \(\sim\)1100 GeV (1300 GeV) can be discovered with 5\(\sigma\) significance with 300 fb\({}^{-1}\) ( 3000 fb\({}^{-1}\)).

Conclusions

The sensitivity to heavy SUSY particles will be increased significantly when the centre-of-mass-energy of the LHC reaches a value close to the design of \(\sqrt{s}=14\) TeV. Feasibility studies on benchmark SUSY scenarios, chargino neutralino production, gluino and light squark pair production, and bottom squark pair production are carried out with 14 TeV MC samples and by applying detector response corrections to generator level particles. An increase of integrated luminosity from 300 fb\({}^{-1}\) to 3000 fb\({}^{-1}\) extends the sensitivity potential for \(\tilde{\chi}^{\pm}_{1}\tilde{\chi}^{0}_{2}\) production by about 300 (350) GeV, assuming \(\tilde{\chi}^{\pm}_{1}\to W\tilde{\chi}^{0}_{1}\) and \(\tilde{\chi}^{0}_{2}\to Z\tilde{\chi}^{0}_{1}\) (\(\tilde{\chi}^{0}_{2}\to h\tilde{\chi}^{0}_{1}\)). For gluino pair production and first and second generation squark pair production, the sensitivity potential is extended up to 500 GeV for an increase of integrated luminosity from 300 fb\({}^{-1}\) to 3000 fb\({}^{-1}\), while the sensitivity to bottom squark pairs is extended by 150 GeV. Future improvements in the understanding of experimental and theoretical systematic uncertainties on the SM background would provide additional potential for sensitivity gains at high luminosity on SUSY scenarios reported here and beyond.
