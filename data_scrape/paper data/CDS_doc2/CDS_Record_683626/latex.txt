Introduction

The purpose of the ATLAS in-plane alignment system is to measure possible deformations of the muon chambers with accuracy adequate to the requirement of the sagitta correction error of \(\leq\) 30 \(\mu m\)[1].

A set of four in-plane optical RASNIK straightness monitors is foreseen for control of such chamber deformations as curvature, torsion and thermal expansion (see Fig. 1). Three components of each RASNIK monitor are mounted on three cross-plates of the chamber support structure: the lens is placed on the middle cross-plate, and the illuminated coded mask and the CCD readout are on the extreme ones. Two of four monitors are parallel to the direction of the chamber drift tubes, the two others have diagonal directions.

Each RASNIK monitor provides measurement of four parameters relevant for reconstruction of chamber shape:

* the lens displacementsin both directions perpendicular to the optical axis;
* the ratio of the image distance and the object distance;
* the relative rotation of the mask and the CCD.

The subject of this note is to estimate the role of these measurements in control of different chamber deformations and to study the in-plane alignment system performance and redundancy.

## 2 Model of the In-Plane Alignment System

The analytical model of the in-plane alignment system is based on the assumption that the MDT chamber geometry is completely defined by the internal properties and relative positions of three cross-plates.

The accepted numbering of the cross-plates is shown in Fig. 1: RASNIK masks, lenses and CCD's are mounted correspondingly on the cross plates number 1,  2,  3.

The designation of RASNIK monitors is the following: the parallel monitors are signed like AB and BA, and the diagonal monitors are AA and BB.

The parameters characterizing the relevant internal properties of the i-th cross-plate are (i = 1,  2,  3)

* the temperature, which will be assumed constant along the cross-plate;
* the sag in y-direction. We will assume, that the shape of the cross plate is a symmetrical parabola.
The relative position of each extreme cross-plate w.r.t. the reference middle cross-plate is defined by 6 parameters (i = 1, 3):

* 3 translations;
* 3 rotations.

The total number of the system degree of freedom is

\[N_{\mathit{par}}=2\cdot 3+6\cdot 2=18 \tag{1}\]

The system of four 4D RASNIK's provides 16 measurements. The whole set of 16 RASNIK readings is divided to two subsets of 8 readings each responsible for the measurement of different deformation parameters.

Thus, 8 measurements \(d_{j}^{y}\) and \(\alpha_{j}^{x}\) (j = AA, BB, AB, BA) allow to reconstruct 6 parameters:

* the chamber sag in y-direction;
* 2 rotations around x-axis of the extreme cross plates w.r.t. the middle one;
* 3 cross-plate sags.

Another 8 in-plane readings \(d_{j}^{z}\) and \(r_{j}^{d}\) (j = AA, BB, AB, BA) measure another 6 deformation parameters:

* the chamber sag in z-direction;
* the chamber non-uniformity in x-direction expansion;
* 2 rotations around y-axis of the extreme cross plates w.r.t. the middle one;
* 2 temperature differences.

So, the in-plane alignment system controls 12 out of 18 parameters characterizing the MDT chamber deformations. 6 uncontrollable parameters are the followings.

* The parameter \(\frac{D_{1}^{z}-D_{2}^{z}}{2}\) describes the parallelogram shape of the chamber in the y-direction (see Fig. 2). This kind of chamber deformation is equivalent, in the first order of magnitude, to the rotation of the chamber as a whole around the z-axis. The control of the relative chamber position is carried out by the external alignment system.
* The same argument is valid for the parameter \(\frac{D_{1}^{z}-D_{2}^{z}}{2}\), which corresponds to the parallelogram shape of the chamber in the z-direction (see Fig. 3). This deformation is equivalent to the chamber rotation around the y-axis.

* The in-plane alignment system does not sensitive also to \(R_{1}^{z},R_{3}^{z}\), the rotations around the z-axis of the extreme cross-plates w.r.t. the middle one. This kind of deformations can be caused by the different temperatures of 2 chamber multilayers.
* The parameter \(\frac{D_{1}^{z}-D_{2}^{z}}{2}\) describes the chamber homotethy along the x-axis. The in-plane alignment system does not control this uniform extension of the chamber in wire direction, but does control the nonuniformity parameter \(\Delta_{x}=\frac{D_{1}^{z}+D_{2}^{z}}{2}\).
* The last uncontrolled parameter is \(t_{2}^{o}\) the temperature of the middle cross-plate. It means, that the in-plane alignment system does not sensitive to the uniform temperature change of the whole chamber (but it is sensitive to the temperature gradients \(\Delta t_{12}^{o}\) and \(\Delta t_{32}^{o}\), see above). This parameter \(t_{2}^{o}\) and the previous parameter \(\frac{D_{1}^{z}+D_{2}^{z}}{2}\) correspond to the uniform chamber expansion/contraction. Correction of the measured sagitta error due to this kind of deformations has to be performed by the external alignment system.

The very important characteristics of the in-plane alignment system is its redundancy. All the previous conclusions are valid if one of diagonal (AA or BB) RASNIK/CCD monitors is lost. In this case 12 measurements provide sufficient information to reconstruct all the mentioned above 12 deformation parameters.

In the case when one of parallel (AB or BA) monitors is lost the alignment procedure allows to reconstruct all the parameters except \(s_{2}\), the sag of the middle cross-plate ( not to confuse it with the chamber sag \(\Delta_{y}\)).

The general conclusion of these considerations is that the in-plane alignment system of four 4D RASNIK straightness monitors can control with sufficient redundancy the most probable chamber deformations like curvature, asymmetrical torsion, nonuniform expansion/contraction. The performance of this system is defined by the proper resolutions of the RASNIK system [2] and by the accuracy of the calibration procedure [3].

## 3 Calibration Procedure

According to the calibration procedure [3] the MDT chamber equipped with the operational RASNIK straightness monitors is installed on the perfect optical bench. The purpose of this bench is to provide initial conditions for the in-plane alignment system with tolerances adequate to the requirement of the sagitta correction \(\leq\) 30\(\mu\)_m_.

The readings of 4 RASNIK's for the chamber, which has

* no sags (inside tolerances \(\sigma_{\Delta_{y}}^{0},\sigma_{\Delta_{z}}^{0},\sigma_{s}^{0}\));
* no torsions (\(\sigma_{R_{x}}^{0}\));* no \(t^{\circ}\)-gradients (\(\sigma^{0}_{R_{g}}\), \(\sigma^{0}_{\Delta x}\), \(\sigma^{0}_{\Delta t}\)),

are assumed to be the monitor initial values (zero readings).

The very important feature of this calibration procedure is that it allows to avoid very accurate placement of the in-plane monitor elements w.r.t. the chamber multilayers.

RASNIK's intrinsic resolutions have to provide control of the chamber deformation parameters inside the tolerances of the optical bench. The results of the MonteCarlo studies of the in-plane alignment system performance and redundancy are presented in the next section.

## 4 Results of the MonteCarlo Simulations

The MonteCarlo program simulates two typical examples of MDT chamber geometries:

* The so-called "MPI Prototype 0", which rectangular layout is close to the layout of BMS chambers;
* The trapezoidal forward MDT prototype [4].

The calculations show that the performance of the deformation parameters reconstruction is almost independent on the chamber sizes, but is defined by the resolution of the optical monitors.

The following values were assumed for the parameters characterizing RASNIK/CCD performance [2]:

* The resolutions of transverse lens displacements: \[\sigma_{y}=\sigma_{z}=1\ \mu m.\] (2)
* The distance ratio resolution: \[\sigma_{d}=2\cdot 10^{-5}.\] (3)
* The resolution of the mask-CCD relative angle: \[\sigma_{\alpha}=50\ \mu m.\] (4)

The sensitivity of the alignment procedure performance to the variation of these parameters was also studied.

The performance of the in-plane alignment system is characterized by the errors of the reconstructed parameters for:

* the chamber sags \(\sigma_{\Delta_{g}}\), \(\sigma_{\Delta_{z}}\), \(\sigma_{s}\);* the chamber torsions \(\sigma_{R_{x}}\);
* the chamber \(t^{o}\)-gradients \(\sigma_{R_{y}}^{0}\), \(\sigma_{\Delta_{x}}\), \(\sigma_{\Delta_{t}}\).

The results of MC calculations for the BMS chamber are presented in Table 1. The nominal RASNIK/CCD resolutions (2)-(4) were assumed. The case of one lost monitor was also considered.

The results for the forward MDT prototype are shown in Table 2.

We would like to stress here, that these results do not depend on the magnitudes of chamber deformations over a wide range. In particular, no change occurs in the deformation parameters errors up to as large values of \(D^{x,y,z}\), \(R^{x,y}\), \(s\), \(\Delta_{t^{o}}\) as

\[D^{x,y,z}\leq\pm 10\ mm, \tag{5}\]

\[R^{x,y}\leq\pm 3\ mrad, \tag{6}\]

\[s\leq\pm 1\ mm, \tag{7}\]

\[\Delta_{t^{o}}\leq\pm 20^{o}. \tag{8}\]

The results presented in Tables 1 and 2 show that the in-plane alignment system of 4 (and even 3) 4D RASNIK/CCD monitors with parameter values (2)-(4) provides sufficient accuracy of the deformation parameters reconstruction.

The dependencies of the deformation parameter errors for the BMS chamber on the values of alignment monitor resolutions are shown in Figs. 4-10.

As one can see, there is still reserve for each parameter (2)-(4). The same conclusion is valid for the forward chamber.

The analytical and MonteCarlo studies of the MDT in-plane alignment system allows to make the following conclusions:

* The set of 4 4D RASNIK/CCD monitors provides an effective control of the following chamber deformations: the chamber sags in both bend (z) and "vertical" (y) directions; the chamber asymmetrical torsions; the chamber \(t^{\circ}\)-gradients.
* The in-plane alignment system is redundant enough: the loss of any 1 out of 4 monitors does not decrease significantly its performance.
* The proper resolutions of the RASNIK/CCD monitor by themselves are high enough to provide the control of important chamber deformations on the level of several microns, so the calibration procedure plays the crucial role for the achieving of the required accuracy of the camber deformation control.
