The ATLAS and CMS Collaborations announced the discovery of a Higgs-like boson in the summer of 2012 [1, 2]. Since then, both collaborations have measured its mass to be approximately 125.5 GeV [3, 4]. Studies of the particle's spin and parity have found the new particle to be compatible with a \(J^{P}=0^{+}\) state [5, 6]. Combined coupling fits of the measured production and decay rates within the framework of the Standard Model (SM) have found no significant deviation from the SM expectations [3, 7]. Therefore the measurements of this new particle's properties strongly suggest that it is indeed a Higgs boson and that a non-zero vacuum expectation value of a Higgs doublet is responsible for electroweak symmetry breaking. The important question remains whether there is only one Higgs doublet as required by the SM, or whether the Higgs sector is extended, leading to more than one Higgs boson of which one has SM-like properties, as predicted in many beyond-SM (BSM) theories.

To better study the Higgs sector as well as to accomplish other physics goals, the LHC is being upgraded from its current center-of-mass energy of \(\sqrt{s}=8\) TeV towards its design energy of 14 TeV during "Long Shutdown 1" in 2013-2014. After this Phase 0 upgrade, instantaneous luminosities of \(10^{34}\) cm\({}^{-2}\) s\({}^{-1}\) are expected to be achieved, resulting in "pile-up" with an average number of \(pp\) interactions per bunch crossing, \(\mu\), of approximately 50. The Phase 1 upgrade [8] during "Long Shutdown 2" in 2018 will increase the instantaneous luminosity to above \(2\times 10^{34}\) cm\({}^{-2}\) s\({}^{-1}\), with the pile-up increasing to \(\mu\sim 140\). This will allow the collection of about 300 fb\({}^{-1}\) of integrated luminosity by about 2022. A Phase 2 upgrade [9] has been proposed that would enable High-Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC) operation at a nominal leveled instantaneous luminosity of \(5\times 10^{34}\) cm\({}^{-2}\) s\({}^{-1}\), allowing the collection of about 3000 fb\({}^{-1}\) of data by 2030.

In Ref. [10] a simultaneous fit of multiple production and decay rates to be measured is used to determine the expected precision of measurements of the couplings of the Higgs boson to other SM particles with 300 and 3000 fb\({}^{-1}\) of data at \(\sqrt{s}=14\) TeV. A parametrized response is used to model the effects of detector acceptances, efficiencies, and resolutions, where the detector performance is extrapolated to the high pile-up conditions expected at higher instantaneous luminosities as described in detail in Refs. [11, 12]. The production and decay channels considered are summarized in Sec. 2 and described in detail in Ref. [10]. The statistical procedures and treatment of systematic uncertainties are the same as those used in combined coupling measurements with the current data [7].

The expected sensitivity to various models of BSM phenomena obtained indirectly from the Higgs coupling measurements is characterized assuming the measured couplings have the values expected in the SM. Three representative classes of models of new physics are chosen for the interpretation. Expected limits are derived for an additional electroweak singlet in Sec. 3, an additional electroweak doublet (two Higgs doublet model) in Sec. 4, and a Higgs portal to dark matter in Sec. 5. These models modify the couplings of the Higgs boson to fermions and vector bosons by simple functions of the fundamental parameters of the BSM theory. Current and future direct searches for additional Higgs bosons and other new phenomena would provide additional constraints on these models, but are not used in the current analysis.

## 2 Input Channels

The luminosity of a HL-LHC would provide substantially improved statistical precision for already established channels and allow rare Higgs boson production and decay modes to be studied. The following decay channels have been included as described in detail in Ref. [10], with each being split into categories sensitive to different production modes:

* \(H\to\gamma\gamma\) in the inclusive, 0-jet, 1-jet, and 2-jet final states, the last with a vector-boson fusion (VBF) selection, as well as 1- and 2-lepton selections with other criteria to separate the \(WH\), \(ZH\)and \(t\bar{t}H\) production modes. The analysis is carried out similarly to Ref. [13].
* \(H\to ZZ^{*}\to 4\ell\) separated into categories sensitive to ggF, VBF, \(ZH/WH\), and \(t\bar{t}H\) production and following a selection similar to that in Ref. [14].
* \(H\to Z\gamma,Z\to\ell\ell\) in inclusive and 2-jet (VBF) final states using the difference \(m_{ll\gamma}-m_{ll}\) between the invariant masses of the dilepton plus photon system and the lepton pair as a discriminating variable. The analysis closely follows that in Ref. [15].
* \(H\to WW^{*}\to\ell\nu\,\ell\nu\) in the 0-jet, 1-jet, and 2-jet final states, the last with a VBF selection. The analysis is similar to that of Ref. [16].
* \(H\to\tau^{+}\tau^{-}\) in the 2-jet final state with a VBF selection as in Ref. [17].
* \(H\to\mu\mu\) in inclusive and \(t\bar{t}H\) final states in a similar fashion to Refs. [18, 19].

In each channel, the trigger and the photon and lepton requirements are adjusted to keep misidentification rates at an acceptable level in the high-luminosity environment. For the VBF jet selection, the cuts are tightened to reduce the expected fake rate induced by pileup.

The \(WH/ZH,H\to b\bar{b}\) final state is not included in the current estimates, as both jet energy resolution and rejection of light jets with \(b\)-tagging algorithms are crucial for this channel and suffer from the pileup conditions at high instantaneous luminosities. More refined studies and a well-understood upgrade design are needed to assess the performance of this channel.

## 3 Additional electroweak singlet

The simplest extension to the SM Higgs sector involves the addition of an electroweak (EW) singlet field [20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26] to the doublet Higgs field of the SM. Both fields acquire non-zero vacuum expectation values. Spontaneous symmetry breaking leads to mixing between the singlet state and surviving state of the doublet field, resulting in two CP-even Higgs bosons, where \(h\) (\(H\)) denotes the lighter (heavier) of the pair. The two Higgs bosons, \(h\) and \(H\), are assumed to be non-degenerate. They couple to fermions and vector bosons in a similar way to that of the SM Higgs boson, but each with a strength reduced by a common scale factor, denoted \(\kappa_{h}\) and \(\kappa_{H}\) respectively. The constraint of unitarity implies that

\[\kappa_{h}^{2}+\kappa_{H}^{2}=1. \tag{1}\]

In this model, the lighter Higgs boson \(h\) has identical decay modes to those of the SM Higgs boson, but with production and decay rates modified according to

\[\begin{array}{lll}\sigma_{h}&=&\kappa_{h}^{2}\times\sigma_{h,\rm SM}\\ \Gamma_{h}&=&\kappa_{h}^{2}\times\Gamma_{h,\rm SM}\\ {\rm BR}_{h,i}&=&{\rm BR}_{h,\rm SM,}i\end{array} \tag{2}\]

where \(\sigma\) denotes the production cross section, \(\Gamma\) denotes the total decay width, BR denotes the branching ratio, and \(i\) indexes the different decay modes.

For the heavier Higgs boson \(H\), new decay modes such as \(H\to hh\) are possible if they are kinematically accessible. In this case its production and decay rates are modified with respect to those of a SM Higgs boson with a mass equal to that of the heavy Higgs boson as a function of the branching ratio of all new decay modes, \(BR_{H,\text{new}}\), as

\[\sigma_{H} = \kappa_{H}^{2}\times\sigma_{H,\text{SM}}\] \[\Gamma_{H} = \frac{\kappa_{H}^{2}}{1-\text{BR}_{H,\text{new}}}\times\Gamma_{H, \text{SM}} \tag{3}\] \[\text{BR}_{H,i} = (1-\text{BR}_{H,\text{new}})\times\text{BR}_{H,\text{SM},i}\]

Here \(\sigma_{H,\text{SM}}\), \(\Gamma_{H,\text{SM}}\), and \(\text{BR}_{H,\text{SM},i}\) denote the cross section, total width, and branching ratio for a given decay mode (indexed \(i\)) predicted for a SM Higgs boson with mass \(m_{H}\).

Consequently the overall signal strength, namely the ratio of the overall rate of production and decay in the channels measured relative to that of a SM Higgs boson with corresponding mass, is given by

\[\mu_{h} = \frac{\sigma_{h}\times\text{BR}_{h}}{(\sigma_{h}\times\text{BR}_{ h})_{\text{SM}}} = \kappa_{h}^{2} \tag{4}\] \[\mu_{H} = \frac{\sigma_{H}\times\text{BR}_{H}}{(\sigma_{H}\times\text{BR}_ {H})_{\text{SM}}} = \kappa_{H}^{2}\left(1-\text{BR}_{H,\text{new}}\right)\]

for \(h\) and \(H\) respectively.

As given in model 1 of Table 18 in Ref. [10], the expected precision on \(\kappa_{h}\) improves from about 3.2% (2.5%) with 300 fb\({}^{-1}\) to 2.5% (1.6%) with 3000 fb\({}^{-1}\) at \(\sqrt{s}=14\) TeV with (without) the inclusion of theory uncertainties in the coupling measurements. This improvement is driven by the high-precision measurements in the \(H\to\gamma\gamma\), \(H\to ZZ^{*}\to 4\ell\), and \(H\to WW^{*}\to\ell\nu\,\ell\nu\) channels. It corresponds to an improvement on the 95% CL upper limit on the coupling to the heavy Higgs boson, \(\kappa_{H}=\sqrt{1-\kappa_{h}^{2}}\), from 0.35 (0.31) with 300 fb\({}^{-1}\) to 0.31 (0.25) with 3000 fb\({}^{-1}\) as indicated in Table 1. These results are independent of the mass and \(\text{BR}_{H,\text{new}}\) of the heavy Higgs boson.

## 4 Two Higgs Doublet Model

Another simple extension of the SM Higgs sector is a class of models termed "Two Higgs Doublet Models" (2HDMs) [26, 27, 28, 29], in which the SM Higgs sector is extended by an additional doublet. A concrete example of this model is realized in the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) since supersymmetry requires a second Higgs doublet, where one of the two Higgs doublets couples only to up-type quarks and the other only to down-type quarks and leptons.

2HDMs predict the existence of five Higgs bosons: two neutral CP-even bosons \(h\) and \(H\), one neutral CP-odd boson \(A\), and two charged bosons \(H^{\pm}\). The most general 2HDMs predict CP-violating Higgs boson couplings as well as tree-level flavor changing neutral currents. Since the latter are strongly constrained by existing data, models considered usually have additional requirements imposed, such as the Glashow-Weinberg condition [30, 31], in order to evade existing experimental bounds.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{c c c c c} Coupling & \multicolumn{2}{c}{300 fb\({}^{-1}\)} & \multicolumn{2}{c}{3000 fb\({}^{-1}\)} \\  & All unc. & No theory unc. & All unc. & No theory unc. \\ \hline \hline \(\kappa_{H}\) & 0.35 & 0.31 & 0.31 & 0.25 \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 1: Expected 95% CL upper limit on \(\kappa_{H}\) with 300 and 3000 fb\({}^{-1}\) at \(\sqrt{s}=14\) TeV, each shown with and without the inclusion of theoretical uncertainties in the coupling measurements.

Both Higgs doublets acquire vacuum expectation values, \(v_{1}\) and \(v_{2}\) respectively, with their ratio being denoted by \(\tan\beta\equiv v_{2}/v_{1}\). Unitarity requires that \(v_{1}^{2}+v_{2}^{2}=v^{2}=(246\) GeV\()^{2}\). The Higgs sector of the 2HDM model can be described by six parameters: four Higgs boson masses (\(m_{h}\), \(m_{H}\), \(m_{A}\), and \(m_{H^{\pm}}\)), \(\tan\beta\), and the mixing angle \(\alpha\) of the two neutral, CP-even Higgs states. A discrete \(\mathcal{Z}_{2}\) symmetry [26] is assumed such that the parameter \(m_{12}\) in the Higgs potential is zero. Gauge invariance fixes the couplings of the two neutral, CP-even Higgs bosons to vector bosons relative to their SM values to be

\[\begin{array}{lll}g_{hVV}^{\rm 2HDM}/g_{hVV}^{\rm SM}&=&\sin(\beta- \alpha)\\ g_{HVV}^{\rm 2HDM}/g_{HVV}^{\rm SM}&=&\cos(\beta-\alpha)\end{array} \tag{5}\]

Here \(V=W,Z\) and \(g_{hVV,HVV}^{\rm SM}\) denote the SM Higgs couplings to vector bosons.

The Glashow-Weinberg condition is satisfied by four types of 2HDMs:

* Type I: One Higgs doublet couples to vector bosons, while the other couples to fermions. The first doublet is "fermiophobic" in the limit of zero mixing.
* Type II: This is an "MSSM-like" model, in which one Higgs doublet couples to up-type quarks and the other to down-type quarks and leptons.
* Type III: This is a "lepton-specific" model, where the Higgs bosons have the same couplings to quarks as in the Type I model and to leptons as in Type II.
* Type IV: This is a "flipped" model, where the Higgs bosons have the same couplings to quarks as in the Type II model, but with lepton couplings as in Type I.

The couplings of the neutral Higgs bosons to fermions and vector bosons in each of the four types of 2HDMs, expressed as ratios relative to the Higgs couplings in the SM, are summarized in Table 2[32]. The coupling strengths are denoted \(\kappa_{V}\) for the \(W\) and \(Z\) bosons, \(\kappa_{u}\) for up-type quarks, \(\kappa_{d}\) for down-type quarks, and \(\kappa_{\ell}\) for charged leptons.

The Higgs rate measurements in different production and decay modes are interpreted in each of these four types of 2HDMs assuming that the new \(\sim 125\) GeV particle observed is the light CP-even neutral Higgs boson \(h\). This is done by rescaling the production and decay rates as functions of the couplings \(\kappa_{V}\), \(\kappa_{u}\), \(\kappa_{d}\), and \(\kappa_{\ell}\). These couplings are in turn expressed as a function of the underlying parameters, two angles \(\beta\) and \(\alpha\), using the relations shown in Table 2.

The coupling-rescaled predictions agree well with those obtained using the SUSHI[33] and 2HDMC[34] MC generators, which calculate Higgs production and decay rates in two Higgs doublet models. The cross section for \(bbH\) associated production, which is neglected in the rescaled predictions, is less than about 1% of the cross section for gluon fusion throughout the ranges of parameter space shown. The rescaled gluon fusion rate agrees with the SUSHI prediction within 0.2%, and the rescaled decay rates show a similar level of agreement.

Figure 1 shows the regions of the \((\cos(\beta-\alpha),\tan\beta)\) plane for each of the four types of 2HDMs that are expected to be excluded at 95% CL or greater with 300 and 3000 fb\({}^{-1}\) at \(\sqrt{s}\)=14 TeV. The expected

excluded regions are derived with pseudodata generated with Higgs couplings having SM parameter values, using a test statistic based on the negative log of the profile likelihood. The best-fit values follow the SM decoupling limit at \(\cos(\beta-\alpha)=0\) or \(\sin(\beta-\alpha)=1\), as expected. The asymmetry of the expected exclusion regions in \(\cos(\beta-\alpha)\) is due to the particular functional dependence of the fermionic couplings on \(\beta\) and \(\alpha\), which is different for each of the four different types of 2HDMs as shown in Table 2. The fermionic couplings play a significant role both in Higgs production via gluon fusion, which in the parameter space considered is expected to be dominated by loop contributions from top and bottom quarks, as well in fermionic decays such as \(H\to\tau\tau\). A second solution corresponding to a negative, non-SM-like fermion coupling lies outside the region shown, but is expected to be excluded at high luminosity using single-top associated production of a Higgs boson [35]. A significant portion of the parameter space can be excluded with 300 fb\({}^{-1}\), with the exclusions improving considerably with higher integrated luminosity.

## 5 Dark matter

"Higgs portal" models [36, 37, 38, 24, 39] introduce an additional weakly-interacting massive particle (WIMP) as a dark matter candidate. It is assumed to interact very weakly with visible matter, except for the Higgs boson. The coupling of the Higgs boson to the WIMP is taken to be a free parameter.

The expected upper limit on the Higgs branching ratio to invisible or undetectable particles, \(BR_{\rm inv,undet}\), is derived under the following assumptions. The couplings of the Higgs boson to other massive particles are assumed to be equal to their Standard Model expectations. Effective couplings to photons and gluons, which are massless, are introduced to absorb the possible effects of new particles contributing through loops.

The ratio of the total Higgs width to its SM expectation, \(\Gamma_{h}/\Gamma_{h,\rm SM}\), is parametrized by \(\kappa_{h}^{2}\) such that

\[\begin{array}{l}\kappa_{h}^{2}=\Gamma_{h}/\Gamma_{h,\rm SM}=\sum\limits_{i}k _{i}^{2}/(1-BR_{\rm inv,undet})\\ \sum\limits_{i}\kappa_{i}^{2}=0.0023\,\kappa_{\gamma}^{2}+0.085\,\kappa_{g}^{2 }+0.91\end{array} \tag{6}\]

where the branching ratios of a Higgs boson with \(m_{h}=125.5\) GeV to photons and gluons are 0.0023 and 0.085 respectively, and 0.91 is the sum of the Higgs branching ratios to massive particles [40].

As given in Table 21 in Ref. [10], the 95% CL upper limit on \(BR_{\rm inv,undet}\) expected with 300 fb\({}^{-1}\) is 0.28 (0.25) with (without) the inclusion of theory uncertainties in the coupling measurements, and decreases to 0.15 (0.12) with 3000 fb\({}^{-1}\).

To allow comparisons with direct searches for dark matter, the upper bound on BR\({}_{\rm inv,undet}\) is translated into constraints on the coupling of the WIMP to nucleons as a function of its mass [38]. It is assumed that the WIMP mass is less than half the Higgs mass and that the resultant Higgs decays to WIMP pairs account entirely for BR\({}_{\rm inv,undet}\). These assumptions produce conservative limits as any additional contributions to BR\({}_{\rm inv,undet}\) from other new phenomena would enhance the limits. The partial width for Higgs decays to a pair of dark matter particles depends on the spin of the dark matter particle. It is given for scalar, Majorana fermion, or vector dark matter candidates (where the Majorana fermion is motivatedFigure 1: Regions of the \((\cos(\beta-\alpha),\ \tan\beta)\) plane expected to be excluded with 300 and 3000 fb\({}^{-1}\) at \(\sqrt{s}=14\) TeV, each shown with and without the inclusion of theoretical uncertainties in the coupling measurements. These are determined for four types of 2HDMs using fits to the expected rates and their precision. The likelihood contours where \(-2\ln\Lambda=6.0\), corresponding approximately to the expected exclusion at 95% CL (2 \(\sigma\)) are indicated. A second solution corresponding to a negative, non-SM-like fermion coupling lies outside the regions shown, but is expected to be excluded using single-top associated Higgs production [35].

by neutralinos in supersymmetry) as

\[\text{scalar }S\,: \Gamma^{\text{inv}}(h\to SS\,) = \lambda_{hSS}^{2}\frac{v^{2}\beta_{S}}{64\pi m_{h}}\] \[\text{fermion }f: \Gamma^{\text{inv}}(h\to ff) = \frac{\lambda_{hff}^{2}v^{2}\beta_{f}^{3}m_{h}}{\Lambda^{2}} \tag{7}\] \[\text{vector }V: \Gamma^{\text{inv}}(h\to VV) = \lambda_{hVV}^{2}\frac{v^{2}\beta_{V}m_{h}^{3}}{256\pi m_{V}^{4}} \left(1-4\frac{m_{V}^{2}}{m_{h}^{2}}+12\frac{m_{V}^{4}}{m_{h}^{4}}\right)\]

Here \(\lambda_{hSS}\), \(\lambda_{hff}/\Lambda\), or \(\lambda_{hVV}\) is the coupling of the Higgs boson to a dark matter particle of corresponding spin, \(v=246\text{ GeV}/\sqrt{2}\) denotes the Higgs vacuum expectation value, and \(\beta_{X}=\sqrt{1-4m_{X}^{2}/m_{h}^{2}}\) is a kinematic factor associated with the two-body \(h\to\chi\chi\) decay. These equations are used to calculate the coupling of the Higgs boson to the dark matter particle, \(\lambda_{h\chi\chi}\) or \(\lambda_{h\chi\chi}/\Lambda\), depending on whether the particle is a scalar, Majorana fermion, or vector boson.

This coupling parameter is then re-parametrized in terms of the cross section for scattering between the DM particle and nucleons via Higgs exchange, \(\sigma_{\chi-N}\)[38]:

\[\text{scalar }S\,: \sigma_{S-N}=\lambda_{hSS}^{2}\frac{m_{N}^{4}f_{N}^{2}}{16\pi m_{ h}^{4}(m_{S}+m_{N})^{2}}\] \[\text{fermion }f: \sigma_{f-N}=\frac{\lambda_{hff}^{2}}{\Lambda^{2}}\frac{m_{N}^{4 }f_{N}^{2}m_{f}^{2}}{4\pi m_{h}^{4}(m_{f}+m_{N})^{2}} \tag{8}\] \[\text{vector }V: \sigma_{V-N}=\lambda_{hVV}^{2}\frac{m_{N}^{4}f_{N}^{2}}{16\pi m_{ h}^{4}(m_{V}+m_{N})^{2}}\]

where \(m_{N}\sim 0.94\) GeV is the nucleon mass, and \(f_{N}=0.33^{+0.30}_{-0.07}\) is the form factor associated with the Higgs-nucleon coupling and is computed using lattice QCD [38].

Upper limits on the WIMP-nucleon scattering cross section \(\sigma_{\chi-N}\) are derived as a function of the WIMP mass \(m_{\chi}\) (\(\chi=S,\ V\), or \(f\)). The expected limits at 95% CL with 3000 fb\({}^{-1}\) of data at \(\sqrt{s}=14\) TeV are shown in Fig. 2 for each of the WIMP spin hypotheses, in comparison with the limits at 90% CL from direct searches for dark matter. The hashed bands indicate the uncertainty resulting from the systematic variation of the form factor \(f_{N}\) within its uncertainty. The figure also shows the excluded and allowed regions from direct searches [41, 42, 43, 44, 45]. The ATLAS expected limits are considerably more stringent at low mass, but degrade as \(m_{\chi}\) approaches \(m_{h}/2\) as expected from kinematics. The limits on the WIMP-nucleon scattering cross section are proportional to \(BR_{\text{inv,undet}}\), so they improve by about a factor of 2 with 3000 fb\({}^{-1}\) compared to 300 fb\({}^{-1}\). The inclusion of theory uncertainties in the coupling measurements do not have a large impact on the relative improvement.

## 6 Conclusions

Models of possible new phenomena predict deviations in the couplings of the light Higgs boson to other particles. The expected precision on measurements of these couplings from the combination of multiple production and decay channels with 300 or 3000 fb\({}^{-1}\) of data at \(\sqrt{s}=14\) TeV have been used to derive expected limits on models of new physics. Expected limits are obtained for an additional electroweak singlet, two Higgs doublet models, and a Higgs portal to dark matter.

The expected upper limit on the couplings of the heavy Higgs boson in models with an additional electroweak singlet improves by about 20% with 3000 fb\({}^{-1}\) compared to 300 fb\({}^{-1}\). Expected exclusionsfor four different types of 2HDMs have been derived as a function of the mixing angle and ratio of vacuum expectation values of the two Higgs doublets, and they improve significantly with higher luminosity. Finally the expected upper limit on the WIMP-nucleon scattering cross section arising through a Higgs portal to dark matter has been derived. It is equally or more sensitive than existing results from direct searches by astroparticle experiments for WIMP masses below \(m_{h}/2\), and improves by about a factor of 2 with 3000 fb\({}^{-1}\) compared to 300 fb\({}^{-1}\).

All are good examples of analyses that would benefit from a high-luminosity upgrade to the LHC in order to collect up to 3000 fb\({}^{-1}\) of data. The inclusion of additional channels, as well as future improvements in the understanding of experimental and theoretical systematic uncertainties on the coupling measurements, would provide additional potential for sensitivity gains at high luminosity.

The hashed bands indicate the uncertainty resulting from the systematic variation of the form factor \(f_{N}\) within its uncertainty. The excluded and allowed regions from direct searches at 90% CL are also shown [41, 42, 43, 44, 45]. The ATLAS expected limits are proportional to \(BR_{\rm inv,undet}\), which improve by about a factor of 2 with 3000 fb\({}^{-1}\) compared to 300 fb\({}^{-1}\) with (without) the inclusion of theory uncertainties in the coupling measurements.
