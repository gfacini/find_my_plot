This note describes the programs XTestROD and XFILAR, developed for the ATLAS TileCal ROD electrical characterization and system tests. All the programs and GUI described here have been written in C and C++. These programs allow to write/read the registers and configure the different operation modes of all the modules in the ROD crate and the ROS computer. Using this software standalone data acquisition runs can also be performed through the VMEbus or the standard read-out cards in ATLAS.
