###### Abstract

The conceptual design of the support structures of the EM muon chambers is presented. On each side of the detector the EM chambers are arranged in four layers: one layer of MDTs and the three layers of TGCs. The chambers are mounted on four individual wheel structures per side. The four wheels are inclined by 1.23% and suspended from two longitudinal beams parallel to the beam axis. In order to allow for the opening of the ATLAS detector the wheels can be displaced longitudinally over a distance of 6 m. In addition individual wheels can be separated from each other by up to 1 m for maintenance purposes.

## 1 Introduction

Since the time when the ATLAS Muon Spectrometer TDR[1] was written the overall ATLAS opening scenario has been revised. The new opening scenario, already briefly mentioned in Section 4.3.2 of ref. [1], requires that all muon chambers located at the ends of the barrel toroid must be displaced from their operating position at z=13-15 m to positions, depending on the type of opening, of up to z=19-21 m. In adapting to this scenario the layout of the end-cap chambers has been reviewed. The FM and EM chambers as described in the TDR have been combined to form single planes of EM chambers. Similarly the FO and EO chambers have been arranged to form a single plane. It is located 500 mm further away from the interaction point than the EO plane in the TDR. Thus more longitudinal space for the opening of the ATLAS detector is provided. Figure 1 shows a side view of the new layout.

This note describes the conceptual design of the support structures for the EM chambers and is meant to serve as input for the forthcoming technical design of the system. It is understood that as a result of the latter the specific design and the method and steps of the assembly may change. The main characteristics and parameters of the full structure, however, should not differ significantly from what is described here.

## 2 Chamber layout and requirements for the support wheel design

### Layout and positioning requirements

The EM muon stations consist of four layers of chambers on each side (A and C) of the detector. The longitudinal and azimuthal arrangement of these chambers has been described in the Muon TDR and is only slightly modified, as explained above. It consists of three layers of trigger chambers (thin gap chambers, TGC) and one layer of precision chambers (monitored drift tubechambers, MDT). The first layer is a triplet of TGCs, it is followed by the layer of MDTs, and the third and fourth layers are TGC doublets.

The chamber planes are orthogonal to the beam axis, i.e. inclined by 1.23% w.r.t. the vertical plane. The positions of the chambers must be known to about 5 mm in radius and z after installation and chambers must be placed within 2 mrad in all three orientations. Under the assumption that deformations of the support structure under gravity can be controlled to about 25% of themselves this leads to the requirements that the deformations of the structures should not exceed 15 mm radially and 20 mm in the z direction. Given the requirements on the accuracy of the chamber placement and the uncertainty in the positioning of the chambers on the support structures an accuracy of 3 mm in the z direction is adequate. The exact position of the wheels with respect to the other chamber planes will measured by the end-cap alignment system, their position with respect to each other by proximity sensors. An initial positioning (also after displacements of the wheels) within a few millimetres is also necessary for staying within the active range of the alignment sensors connected to the MDT wheel.

#### 2.1.1 MDTs

The layout of the MDT chambers is shown in Figure 2. The large and small chambers are located in two planes separated by 45 mm from each other in the z direction. Neighbouring chambers are overlapping in the azimuth. Each MDT chamber is supported at three points linked to the positions of the chamber long-beams. The positions of the support points are shown in Figure 3 and the corresponding loads for the EML and EMS chambers are shown in Figure 4 and 5.

Figure 1: Longitudinal view of the muon system showing the positions of the large chambers in solid lines and the small chambers in broken lines. On the left side, in front of the EO chambers, the outline of the EM chambers in their retracted position is shown. The broken line on the right side of the retracted EM chambers indicates the space required for opening. Also indicated by a broken lines is the outline of the end-cap toroid in its retracted position.

#### 2.1.2 TGCs

The layout of the TGCs is shown in Figure 6; the chambers form three distinct wheels with diameters of 22-24 m and are arranged in outer and inner rings of 24 modules, each. The inner rings consist of 24 detector units per wheel and are connected to the external support at their four corners. The outer rings are consist of 48 azimuthal segments (composed of four or five radially overlapping detector units) with two of them being connected to a common support frame. As an example the support frame of the TGC1 wheel is shown in Figure 7. It will be connected at 8 (TGC1) or 10 (TGC2/3) positions to the spokes of the wheels and at four (one) position to the outer (inner) support rings of the wheels. Details of these connections are also shown in Figure 7. The connection itself is made by means of two bolts each.

Figure 5: Location of the support points for the EMS chambers and the corresponding loads in kgFigure 8-10 give the approximate locations of the connections to the spokes of the three TGC wheels and the corresponding forces at these points. The combined force is given when two connection points are close to each other, typically in between two chamber units. At the connection points on the top and the bottom only very small loads (few kg) are active

In addition to the MDT and TGC chambers the structures are required to carry some auxiliary equipment. The MDT support wheel must carry eight gas and eight electronics racks, and 48 electronics crates must be connected to the TGC1 wheel, see Section 5 for details and the corresponding weights.

### Opening and access

During the ATLAS opening the full set of the four layers of chambers must be retracted longitudinally by about six metres. During this operation the four wheels should be moved individually, taking the cable and service connections between the wheels into account, or coupled to each other such that they can be moved together. Such an operation is expected to happen a few times per year. Given the low frequency of this operation there are no particular requirements on the speed for the translation of the wheels; values about 1-2 minutes/m would be adequate.

Figure 6: 3-D view of the layout of the TGCs on the TGC1wheel (a) and TGC2 and TGC3 wheels (b)

The connections between the four wheels should be as short as possible. However, in order to provide access to the chambers during maintenance periods it is required that the individual chamber layers can be separated from each other by about 1 m.

### Material

In order to limit the Coulomb scattering of the muons the amount of material in the structure must be reduced to a minimum and preferably be located at the inner and outer rims of the structure.

Figure 7: Support frame on the TGC1 wheel; the internal support points for the chamber units are indicated as well as and the connection points to the wheel on the outside. In addition to the 16 connections to spokes there are four connections on the top and one on the bottom, see details.

The structure must be made of nonmagnetic materials; materials with large radiation length are preferred, i.e. aluminium rather than stainless steel, however, also other nonmagnetic materials could be considered.

## 3 Overall implementation

The chamber support wheels are suspended individually from two longitudinal beams connected to the cavern walls and are guided in the bottom in a third support point. The latter serves also to keep the structures inclined during their displacements.

Figure 8: Positions of points in which the TGC frames will be connected to the wheel structure and the corresponding loads for the TGC1 wheel

The location of the support beams is shown in Figure 11. The support beams run parallel to the beam axis and extent over 8000 mm in z. They are designed for deformations under load not exceeding 5 mm.

An example for the beams and support brackets is given in Figure 12 for a structure with three brackets. In order to keep the suspension points symmetric to the mid-plane of the support wheels the beams on the USA side are mounted on extension brackets. The brackets are connected to the upper part of the cavern wall to avoid conflicts with cryogenics and ventilation infrastructure in the cavern.

Figure 13 shows the FEA results for the deflection of the beams under full load with all four wheels positioned at one rail end. The maximum deformations are less than 3.5 mm.

Figure 9: Positions of points in which the TGC frames will be connected to the wheel structure and the corresponding loads for the TGC2 wheel

## 4 Conceptual design of the support structures

All four structures have the form of suspended wheels. Solid inner and outer 'rings' are connected to each other by radial'spokes'. The spokes themselves are interconnected at one or several radial positions. They serve at the same time as structural elements and as connection points for the chamber supports. The cross-section, shape and exact layout of the support structure elements vary from wheel to wheel and are described below. Since each structure is too large to be installed as a complete unit the structures have been designed such that they can be assembled from smaller units. The scenario described here uses quarters which are bolted together during the final assembly. The individual quarters are welded.

The wheel is suspended from a yoke reinforcing the upper part of the outer ring structure. The yoke is extended on both sides up to the position of the longitudinal support beams where it is connected to a motorized traction system.

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:11]

TGC3 wheels extend only to pseudorapidity values of 2.4. The corresponding dimensions are shown in Figure 14

The specific design of the four wheels is discussed in more detail below. Each structure has been calculated using ANSYS 5. The main characteristics and the maximum deformations of the structures under load are summarized in Table 2. The largest deformations appear in the z

direction as a result of the inclination of the wheels by 1.23%. They are well in the acceptable ranges.

### The MDT wheel

The design of the MDT wheel is shown in Figure 15. Since it covers the largest space in the longitudinal direction provisions have been made that all electronics and gas racks can be connected to the outside of this structure.The structure is made of an inner and outer ring connected by 36 spokes and four intermediate rings which connect the spokes with each other. These rings are located in the mid-plane of the structure, in between the two MDT planes. The

\end{table}
Table 2: Characteristics of the four support wheels

Figure 14: Dimensions and radial positions of the inner rings of the support wheels

spokes are located on both sides of these rings such that the chambers can be mounted onto the structure from both sides.

Their cross-sections and shapes are also shown in Figure 15. The chambers are attached via kinematical supports to the spokes of the wheel as shown in Figure 15 and 16. In addition to the chambers the MDT wheel will carry the gas and electronics racks, see Section 5, which are connected to sides of the structure. Not shown is the TGC gas rack which will supply the TGCs in the lower part. It will be connected to the outer frame in a 7-8 o'clock position.

The results of the FEA of the structure are given in Figure 17.

### The TGC wheels

The structures for the three TGC wheels are very similar in design, the difference being the longitudinal and radial dimensions of the structures. The designs are shown in Figure 18 and 20, including the shape and dimensions of the structural elements; the designs of the TGC2 and TGC3 structures are identical.

The structure is made of an inner and outer ring connected by 24 spokes. Although the TGCs of the 2nd and 3rd plane (doublets) use less longitudinal space than the ones of the first plane (triplet) the outer and inner ring structures were chosen to have the same longitudinal extent for stability reasons. A further ring connecting the spokes has been introduced at the radius where the azimuthal segmentation of the TGC modules changes from 24 to 48.

Figure 19 and 21 give the results of the FEA. The largest deformations of the structure in x and y are below 7 mm. The deformation in the z direction is the result of the inclination of the plane by 1.23%, it is below 20 mm

### The suspension system

Each of the four wheels has its individual and independent suspension system. Each wheel is suspended from a single rolling element per side such that there is an automatic rotational degree of freedom allowing for the required inclination of the wheel.This is shown in Figure 22.

Figure 23: Cross-section and side view of a possible suspension and traction system for the wheels. The threaded bar and the motorization is shown on the right side. The motor block is moving with the wheel and is guided on an auxiliary longitudinal beam connected to the rail support brackets. The connection of the motor block to the wheel is shown in the longitudinal view on the left.

Figure 22: View of the suspension of the four wheelsThe suspension system itself and its motorization are not yet fully designed. It should be such that the four wheel can be moved together or individually.

Given that the total weights of the wheels are very similar the same suspension elements can be used for the four wheels. A possible solution is shown in Figure 23 where the motor, connected to the wheel yoke, is moving along a threaded bar. The connection between the motorized part and the wheel is such that rotations of the two systems w.r.t. each other are possible. The motor is guided during the movement of the full structure in a guiding rail mounted to the rail support brackets.

## 5 Integration of services

In addition to the chambers the gas distribution and cooling system and part of the electronics is located on the support structures and will move together with the chambers when the chambers are displaced.

The characteristics of this auxiliary equipment is given in Table 3. The number of racks and crates and the cable connections between the four planes and the service cavern are summarized in Table 4.

\end{table}
Table 3: Characteristics of racks and cratesSpace and attachment points for the crates and racks have been foreseen on the TGC1 and MDT wheels, as shown in Section 4.

The gas and cooling racks are placed on the +x side (opposite to the USA cavern) and the electronics racks on the -x side (facing the USA cavern).

In order to allow for the separation of the wheels from each other by up to 1000 mm for maintenance purposes flexible cable and gas connections are foreseen between the MDT wheel and the three TGC wheels. The gas and electronics racks being located along the two sides of the MDT wheel all connections between the TGCs and these racks will be also located there. This is shown schematically in Figure 24. The internal routing of the services on each individual wheel will be done accordingly.

The exact layout of the services on the individual wheels is not yet finalized.

For the MDTs there will be about 10-15 cables with diameters of 5-10 mm from each chamber to the electronics racks connected to the USA side of the MDT wheel. Four of the cables per chamber are for signal transport. They may either be copper and converted into optical signals in the electronics racks or optical fibres with the opto-couplers sitting on the chambers. In the racks up to 32 of the signal cables will be grouped together, and routed to the USA15 cavern via optical fibres. The total number of optical fibres per MDT wheel is not yet decided but will be less than 80, corresponding to a total cross-section of 25 cm\({}^{2}\). The routing of the signal cables on the wheel will depend on the location of the opto-couplers; either radially outwards along the chambers edges and then along the outer rim of the wheel (a); or radially inwards, around the inner ring of the wheel, and then to the electronics racks (b). All the other cables will follow the path (a). These are low and high voltage cables and some control cables (CAN bus, etc.).

The TGC services will be pre-installed on the TGC frames which cover 1/24th of the azimuth, each. All the cabling and piping connecting the chambers between each other on one frame is

Figure 24: Location of flexible connections between TGC and MDT wheels.

done internally. Very few lines connect different frames, if at all. The power supplies for the TGCs are located in the racks connected to the MDT wheel. The cable distribution follows the path (a) as described for the MDT cables.

The routing of the trigger cables connecting the TGC1 and TGC2/3 chambers will be concentrated in as few as possible equally distributed locations in azimuth at the outer edge of the structure. The cables have to take the separation of the wheels by up to 1000 mm into account. Cable loops between the wheels or at their outer circumference will provide for this. A schematical implementation scheme is shown in Figure 24.

The connection of the wheels to the USA15 service cavern requires flexible cables and pipes which allow for a six metre move of the full structure. A total of up to 250 TGC cables and 100 MDT cables of 5-10 mm diameter are required. Most of these cables will be optical fibres. Three cable bundles of 50\(\times\)200 mm\({}^{2}\) for the TGCs and one of 50\(\times\)100 mm\({}^{2}\) for the MDTs on flexible cable chains must be foreseen.

The small number of connections to the gas racks (less than 20) allows for the use of flexible pipes for the full range of movement.

## 6 Cost estimate

A very rough cost estimate is given in Table 5. It is based on the amount and type of material used in the conceptual design and separated into three parts: the longitudinal rails structure, the suspension system, and the wheels. Not counted here are the costs for the support rails and brackets, racks, crates, and cable chains.

## 7 Assembly and installation

The installation of the EM chambers is still under discussion. At present two scenarios are being pursued. One scenario foresees the assembly of the wheels together with the installation of their chambers at the very end of the muon chamber installation sequence. In this scenario it is mandatory that all other ATLAS detectors are in place, in particular the end-cap toroid modules must be in their operating position and the cavern space at the two ends of the barrel toroid must be clear up to the collimators. In the other scenario a very early assembly of the wheels without muon chambers is considered; all wheels are stored underground and the chambers would be installed later.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|c|c|c|} \hline  & **Material** & **Weight** & **No. of** & **Cost/unit** & **Costs** \\  & & **(t)** & **pieces** & **(kCHF)** & **(kCHF)** \\ \hline \hline

\end{table}
Table 5: Cost estimate for the four wheels on one side of the detector The final procedure for the assembly and installation of the support wheels and their chambers will be matched to fit best the overall ATLAS installation schedule. It should also take wheel construction issues into account.

### Wheel assembly scenario 1

In order to restrict the time of installation in the UX cavern to a minimum it is attempted to pre-assemble the wheels in parts as large as possible. The dimensions of the SX hall, the available height under the crane hooks, and the size of the access shafts with 18 m and 12.6 m diameter prevent the lowering of the wheel support structures in complete units. A further restriction is the size of the doors of the SX hall (\(8\times 8\) m\({}^{2}\)).

Therefore it is was chosen to assemble the full wheel from quarters which themselves will be welded together inside the SX hall. For this operation the entry space of the SX hall is foreseen, see Figure 25. The assembly has not yet been studied in detail. In order to limit the assembly time in the SX hall it is conceivable that each quarter will be assembled from three smaller units, prefabricated themselves elsewhere.

The pre-assembly of the wheel quarters will be done on jigs in horizontal position. For this the left section of the hall is used. For transport and manipulation the wheel quarters will be stiffened by a temporary structure. Temporary storage of pre-assembled quarters is foreseen on the right end of the hall.

Figure 25: Layout of the SX hall. For the pre-assembly of the wheel quarters, in horizontal position, the left section of the hall is used; the storage of pre-assembled quarters is foreseen in the right end of the hall; the middle section of the hall is used to bring the wheel quarter into the vertical position as sketched in the upper part of the figure.

#### 7.1.1 Variant a

When two quarters are completed they will be assembled into a half wheel, still on the surface. For this operation the upper part of the shafts are used. The first (lower) quarter of the structure is moved into the vertical position above the access shaft as sketched in Figure 25 using the SX cranes. Since the height of the wheel quarter is larger than the hook height the wheel will be pivoted around some auxiliary support structure across the access shaft and lowered into the shaft. It is then fixed to a temporary structure spanning across the access shaft which at the same time serves as a working platform.

This is shown in Figure 26. Now the second (upper) quarter of the wheel is added using the same procedure as for the first one to bring it into the vertical position. The two quarters and their temporary support frames will be bolted together and lowered into the UX cavern. During this operation temporary jigs will guarantee the mechanical integrity of the half-wheels.

The area of the UX cavern accessible by the SX and UX cranes for assembly of the wheels and installation of the chambers is restricted to z=13-18 m. It is therefore proposed to build a temporary scaffolding at z=20 m, just in front of the EO chamber station. From this structure access to the wheel under construction and installation is provided. The assembly of the wheels and installation of the chambers will be done using the UX cranes at z=17-18 m. The layout of the assembly zone with a sketch of the temporary scaffolding is shown in Figure 27.

The half-wheel is placed on one side on the support rail and in the bottom on the guiding rail. The temporary stiffening structure is secured by the UX crane via some extension beam or/and to some fixed anchorage points. This is sketched in Figure 28.

For the second half-wheel the same operation is repeated and the two half-wheels are bolted together. Only then will the four temporary stiffening structures be removed and re-used for the next wheel.

Figure 28: Situation in the UX cavern after the lowering of the first half-wheel.

Figure 27: Layout of the assembly zone in the UX cavern showing schematically the position and size of the temporary scaffolding

#### 7.1.2 Variant b

As in variant a the wheels are made of quarters. This time, however, the full assembly of the quarters into wheels is done underground. The EO support structure, not yet equipped with chambers, is used as assembly jig. The sequence is illustrated in Figure 30-34.. The first quarter is lowered into UX using the SX crane, placed on the ground floor, and temporarily stabilized (Step 1). It is then picked up by either an auxiliary crane (connected to the EO structure and capable of taking loads of 3-4 t; such a crane is not yet foreseen) or an extension to the UX crane. It is moved into is assembly position, connected to the bottom rail, and fixed via its transport frame to a temporary support on the EO structure (Step 2). The third step is to lower the second quarter, to place on the side of the first quarter, and to connect the two. In Steps 4 and 5 the procedure is repeated to complete the wheel. During these steps the two upper quarters of the wheel will be placed on the longitudinal rails on the cavern walls.

The advantage of this variant is that no pre-assembly over the shaft is required, instead some more jigging and temporary support structures in UX instead of the bridge over the shaft.

#### 7.1.3 Chamber installation

The next step is the installation of chambers and the connection of chamber services and cables, the details of which are not yet defined. All these operations will be done with the wheels in the vertical position. Only when the wheel is completed it will be brought into its inclined position. At this point the chambers may have to be realigned. Then the wheel is moved into its final location close to the toroid.The liberated space is re-used for the assembly of the next wheel, etc.

Figure 29: Complete structure in the UX cavernFigure 31: Step 2 of the assembly variant b: the first wheel quarter with its transport frame is picked up by an UX crane and connected to the jig on the EO structure.

Figure 30: Step 1 of the assembly variant b: the first wheel quarter is lowered with its transport frame into the UX cavern and temporarily stabilized, waiting for being picked up by an UX crane.

Figure 33: Step 4 of the assembly variant b: the third wheel quarter is connected to the lower half of the wheel on the EO structure and placed on the upper support rail.

Figure 32: Step 3 of the assembly variant b: the second wheel quarter is with its transport frame is connected to the first quarter on the EO structure, forming the lower half-wheel.

The installation sequence is:

1. TGC1 wheel
2. TGC1 chambers
3. Services from TGC1 to USA15
4. MDT wheel
5. MDT chambers
6. Services from MDT to USA15
7. TGC2 wheel
8. TGC2 chambers
9. TGC3 wheel
10. TGC3 chambers.

When all four wheels on one side are completed the interconnection between the four wheels (services, cables) and the connections to the USA15 cavern will be finished.

An alternative to the sequence described above is to first assemble all wheels (this could be done very early), store the wheels against the EO structure, and to install all chambers at a later stage, see Section 7.3.

### Wheel assembly scenario 2

A completely different approach is to fully assemble the wheels in the UX area using the EO structure as jig. There would be no pre-assembly in the surface hall. The building blocks should

Figure 34: Step 5 of the assembly variant b: the fourth wheel quarter is added to complete the wheel.

be as large as possible but still small enough to enter the SX hall. These parts would then be lowered into the UX area and assembled on the jigs connected to the EO structure. The wheel structures could then either be welded or bolted together. This method would require three different jigs and probably some more temporary scaffolding than the other two variants. It would also most likely require some modifications of the design of the wheels to adapt to this form of assembly. It clearly has the advantage of avoiding the complicated manipulation and turning of the quarters in the surface hall. For the sequence of the assembly of wheels and chambers the same options as above are valid.

### Schedule

A reliable estimate of the overall installation time can only be given when the technical design of the structures is completed. As a working hypothesis the following assumptions have been made:

* Pre-assembly of a quarter-wheel from larger pre-fabricated parts: 4 days;
* Assembly of a half-wheel and lowering into UX: 2 days;
* Assembly of full wheel out of quarters in UX: 4 days;
* Assembly of full wheel out of small part in UX: 5 days, if bolted;
* Assembly of full wheel out of small part in UX: 10 days, if welded;
* Installation of chambers per wheel: 10 days (MDTs) and 6 days (TGCs);
* Services and cabling: 11 days per wheel.

Whenever possible activities are done in parallel.

#### 7.3.1 Combined wheel and chamber installation

With these assumptions the time estimated for the completion of all four wheels on one side of the detector is 90 working days for the Assembly Scenario 1, Variant a. The sequence of the installation is shown in the schedule given in Figure 35 where only the installation on one of the two detector sides (A) has been given in detail. It has here been assumed that during the time of the assembly of the wheels in the underground cavern the ATLAS detector is fully closed on the side under installation.

The same sequence as for side A is required for side C following the completion of the installation on side A. Provided the installation on side A can start middle of August 2004 all muon chambers are installed by the end of April 2005.

In Variant b maybe a few days could be gained by avoiding the pre-assembly of the half-wheels over the access shaft and the temporary scaffolding in the UX cavern. On the other hand some extra time may be needed for the temporary stabilization of the quarters when they are placed on the ground floor by the SX crane to be picked up by the UX crane.

The assembly scenario 2 has not been studied in any detail. Depending on the time for the setting up and the modifications of the jigs on the EO structure and the assembly of the wheels at best a few days (less than a week) could be saved.

#### 7.3.2 Separated wheel and chamber installation

A possible alternative to the scheme discussed above is to separate the wheel assembly from the chamber installation. The wheels, without the chambers, could be assembled immediately after the completion of the barrel toroid assembly, in parallel with the assembly of the calorimeters. The present ATLAS schedule does not yet foresee such a scheme. It could, however, be adapted by rescheduling part of the calorimeter assembly, without changing the dates of bringing the calorimeters into their final positions[2]. A time period of about two months (August and September 2003), in parallel with the assembly of the barrel calorimeter, would allow for the assembly of all four wheels on side C. Another period of two months (October and November 2003), in parallel with the assembly of the end-cap calorimeter on side C, could be available for the assembly of the four wheels of side A.

The assembly of the chambers would still happen only after all other chambers have been installed, towards the end of 2004. It would require some additional scaffolding to be setup and taken down between each layer of chambers. It is not clear if there would be a lot of gain of time compared to the combined assembly of wheels and chambers. A detailed schedule has not yet been worked out.
