## 1 The RASNIK system, its components and radiation hardness requirements

### Introduction

**RASNIK components have been irradiated with \(\gamma\)-rays, with fast neutrons, and with energetic protons. In this paper we report on the observed radiation damage, and we asses the expected performance degradations of RASNIK systems, to be employed in the future ATLAS Muon (barrel) Spectrometer.**

### The RASNIK alignment system for the Barrel Muon Spectrometer

With RASNIK, the relative alignment of three objects is measured. Some 7000 of these systems are applied to monitor the geometry of the ATLAS Muon Spectrometer. It includes the measurement of the geometry of individual chambers (the InPlane systems), as well as the relative position of these chambers (Axial, Proximity, BarReference and Projective) systems.

In ATLAS, four components of the Barrel RASNIK system are exposed to radiation: a) the image sensor (**RasCam**), b) the light source of the image source (**RasLed**), c) the multiplexer for video signals from different RasCams (**RasMux**), and d) the **MasterMux** units which control the RasMux units.

### The RASNIK components

**The RasCam.** [RasCam] Its essential part is the CMOS image sensor VV5430A. The outputs of RasCam are a video signal and a pixel sync signal. By means of an I\({}^{2}\)C bus, parameters of the image sensor can be controlled. Gain and shutter time can be set, or, as alternative, be automatically adjusted by the RasCam itself.

The RasCams are powered only 1.5 per mille of the time.

A list of applied components is given in Appendix 1.

**The RasLed** [RasLed]. In the RasLed cards, LEDs from Hewlett-Packerd were applied. From previous radiation hardness studies [ProsperoII] we learned that LEDs from other manufactures can stand radiation much less.

The RasLeds are powered only 1 per mille of the time.

A list of applied components is given in Appendix 2

**The RasMux unit** [RasMux]. Each RasMux can control 8 RasCams (power and signals) and 16 RasLeds (power). In ATLAS, 16 RasMuxes are controlled by a MasterMux. A RasMux is not powered if none of its connected RasCams or RasLeds is active. A RasMux is therefore only powered during 1 percent of the time.

A list of applied components is given in Appendix 3

**The MasterMux unit.** The MasterMux unit controls up to 16 RasMux units. The functionality of the MasterMux and the RasMux units are almost identical. Besides some connectors, it contains the same electronic components as the RasMux. For this reason we consider the test results of the RasMux to be representative for the MasterMux as well.

A MasterMux is powered during 16 percent of the time.

### The tests

We have tested the RASNIK components in the following facilities:

* for Total Ionisation Dose (TID): Pagure, Saclay, France: \({}^{60}\)Co \(\gamma\) rays (Feb 2, 2001)
* for Non-Ionising Energy Loss (NIEL): Prospero, Valduc, France: 1 MeV neutrons (July 5, 2001)
* for Single Event Effects (SEE): Cyclone CRC, Louvain-la-Neuve, Belgium: 40 MeV protons (August 30, 2001)
* for accelerator environment radiation: CERN/LHC RADWG 2000: blend of fixed-target radiation products. April 27 until September 9, 2000 CERN/LHC RADWG 2001: blend of fixed-target radiation products (May -Sept 2001)

### The requirements

The most recent values for the Simulated Radiation Levels (SRL's), for TID, NIEL and SEE radiation, are given in the table 1. They are the worst case values within the volume of the ATLAS Muon Barrel Spectrometer. The safety factors for:

1) the uncertainty in the SRL's (SF\({}_{\rm sim}\)),

2) the uncertainty due to Low Dose Rate Effects (SF\({}_{\rm ldr}\)),

3) the uncertainty due to applying and testing different production batches (SF\({}_{\rm lot}\))

are given in the same table, as well as the resulting safety factor and Atlas Muon Barrel Required Dose (AMBRD).

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|l|l|l|l|} \hline
**Rad** & **SRL (max)** & **Unit** & **SF\({}_{\rm sim}\)** & **SF\({}_{\rm ldr}\)** & **SF\({}_{\rm ltot}\)** & **AMBRD** \\ \hline TID & 4.69 & Gy.(10y)\({}^{\rm-1}\) & 3.5 & 5 & 4 & 70 & 328 \\ \hline NIEL & 0.301 \(\cdot\) 10\({}^{\rm 11}\) & neutron.cm\({}^{\rm-2}\).(10y)\({}^{\rm-1}\)(1 MeV eq.) & 5 & 1 & 4 & 20 & 6.02. E+11 \\ \hline SEE & 0.951 \(\cdot\) 10\({}^{\rm 10}\) & hadron.cm\({}^{\rm-2}\).(10y)\({}^{\rm-1}\)(40 MeV eq.) & 5 & - & 4 & 20** & 0.47. E+11** \\ \hline \end{tabular}

* This value was supposed to be set by the Atlas Muon Spectrometer group. Since there is no such value, and since we did not observe any SEE during the tests, we use, as practical value, the quantity\(\rm{AMBRD_{see}}=2\) x SRL\({}_{\rm{SEE}}\) x SF\({}_{\rm{sim}}\) x SF\({}_{\rm{tot}}\) x DutyCycle, after private communication with Martin Dentan/Radiation Task Force. As value for DutyCycle we use highest value (0.17) associated with the MasterMux.

_Table 1._

### Quality criterion

A proper RASNIK systems requires:

* **sufficient electronic functionality** (generation of video signals, multiplexing, signal transport, current levels, control & communication);
* **analysable images**. The radiation damage of a RasLed results in a reduced light output, and therefore in a reduction of the S/N ratio of the video images. The damage of RasCams results in an increase and larger spread of the pixel dark currents, and in a decrease and larger spread of the sensitivity per pixel, and, possible, in a larger noise per pixel. As a result, the ratio of the output of pixels in a light and a dark chess field will decrease, and the noise per pixel will increase. After a large irradiation dose, image analysis will fail.

Since functional failure did not occur, the reduced S/N ratio of video signals, due to radiation damage is the limiting factor for using RASNIK in a radiation environment. In the design stage of implementing RASNIK into a radioactive environment, this ratio can be chosen almost arbitrarily large by increasing the amount of light from the image source, received by the image sensor, by using a strong light source and/or by using lenses with a large diameter.

In the barrel part of the Atlas Muon spectrometer, the light sources and lenses have been produced. The In-Plane systems of the BOL chambers have the lowest illumination (aperture: 0.0082). For image quality levels we refer therefore to the **'worst case BOL aperture'** systems.

In almost all cases the images from irradiated systems can be analysed by the'standard' image analysis routine (Woudstra/Linde, NIKHEF, Version 132). Some images from highly damaged systems could only be processed using a routine from Brandeis University (Kevan Hashemi). None of these routines is optimised for analysing bad images. In the past, even worse images appeared to be analysable using Fourier transformation techniques. We used the Brandeis image analysability as acceptance criterion. This leaves a (non-quantitative) margin for worse images, to be analysed by special routines.

## 2 The TID results

At Pagure, we irradiated the RASNIK components with \(\gamma\)-rays from a \({}^{60}\)Co source.. A complete RASNIK system on a 30 cm long test bench was placed at a distance of 114 cm from the source. The local irradiation speed was 66 Gy/h. A 2\({}^{\mathrm{nd}}\) RasCam, a 2\({}^{\mathrm{nd}}\) RasLed and the RasMux were placed at the same distance. A 3\({}^{\mathrm{rd}}\) RasCam was placed at a distance of 185 cm. A bicycle bulb lamp was placed next to the RasLed in the test bench providing a stable reference light source.

**Damage of the RASNIK system**. Fig 1 shows images from a RASNIK system, configured in the worst case Atlas/Muon/BOL geometry, composed from components irradiated with 377 Gy. The images originate from the test bench RasCam and the 2\({}^{\mathrm{nd}}\) RasCam, respectively; the test bench RasLed was used for both. The images can be analysed by the'standard' (NIKHEF 132) analysis routine.

The **radiation damage of RasCam** can be obtained from images from the test bench system with the bulb lamp as light source. The output of some reference pixels that represent the light level in a dark and light chess field, has been plotted in fig.2, as a function of the collected dose. The image sensor was operated in the _fixed gain_ mode. An increase in dark current towards the end of the irradiation period can be noticed: this did not vanish after 10 days.

**Radiation damage of RasLed.** Fig.3 shows the signal output from the test bench, but here a RasLed was used as light source. The measurements at 160 and 250 Gy suggest a substantial reduction in the light output. The measurement at 377 Gy, taken after a period in which the power had been off for 15 minutes, shows that the damage recovers quickly. A direct measurement of the light output of both RasLeds, done one month after the irradiation, showed no observable reduction of the light output.

**Radiation damage of the RasMux**

At the start of the test the RasMux drew a power current of 58 mA. RasCams and RasLeds were switched off for this measurement. The current consumption steadily increased to 116 mA in 5 hours, 25 minutes, at a received dose of 350 Gy. At that point the communication failed, while the analog circuitry and clock drivers still worked. The unit was switched off for 15 minutes and responded again. At that moment the current consumption was 102 mA. Just at the end of the test (integrated dose: 377 Gy) the unit failed again, drawing 112 mA. After 4 days the current went down to 78 mA. Temperature scans could not pinpoint a particular circuit drawing excessive current. There seems to be a general increase in the CMOS circuits, due to charge accumulation into the "thick oxide", creating a parasitic current path. After 2 weeks the current of the unit is 74 mA, very slowly decreasing. After 12 weeks, the excess current had vanished completely.

**Conclusions**. All RASNIK components survived a dose of 1.15 times the Atlas Muon Barrel Required Dose of TID. The radiation damage of the RasMux unit vanished after a few months.

## 3 The NIEL results

**The PROSPERO 2001 test set up**

A complete RASNIK system on a 30 cm long test bench was placed at a distance of 1804 mm away from the reactor. In addition, RasLeds and RasCams were placed at a variety of distances. These distances, and the integrated dose are given in table 2:

**Test Bench RASNIK images**. In fig.4, images are shown from a RASNIK system placed at a distance of 1800 mm from the Prospero reactor. The optical geometry of this test bench was such that its aperture corresponds to that of the worst case

ATLAS/Muon/BOL system.

The integrated dose after irradiation corresponds to 8.5 times the Atlas Muon Barrel

Required Dose of NIEL. The images are well analysable with the standard (NIKHEF

132) analysis routine. From the bottom image the reduction of the radiation damage after one year is clear.

**Radiation damage of RasLeds**. In table 2 the light output, relative to a non-irradiated

RasLed card, is given. The measurement took place 2 months after the irradiation.

**Radiation damage of RasCams**. In table 2 the ratio of the video signal amplitude, with respect to a non-irradiated RasCam, is given. The measurement took place 2 months after the irradiation.

**Radiation damage of the RasMuxes**. The 'Far' RasMux did not show any effect. The 'near' RasMux showed some current increase. Half of this increase disappeared after 50 days.

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|} \hline
**Component** & **Distance to reactor** & **Integrated dose** & **Performance** \\  & **(mm)** & **(n x 10\({}^{11}\)cm\({}^{-2}\), 1 MeV eq.)** & **(\% of fresh)** \\ \hline
**RasLed** & & & \\ \hline RasLed 1 & 1235 & 100 & 19 \\ \hline RasLed 2 & 1235 & 100 & 20 \\ \hline RasLed test bench & 1804 & 51 & 72 \\ \hline RasLed 4 & 2000 & 41 & 78 \\ \hline RasLed 5 & 5700 & 6.1 & 96 \\ \hline RasLed 6 & 5700 & 6.1 & 90 \\ \hline
**RasCam** & & & \\ \hline RasCam 1 & 1235 & 100 & 16 \\ \hline RasCam 2 & 1335 & 90 & 25 \\ \hline RasCam test bench & 1804 & 51 & 64 \\ \hline RasCam 4 & 2000 & 41 & 75 \\ \hline RasCam 5 & 5700 & 6.1 & 94 \\ \hline RasCam 6 & 5700 & 6.1 & 99 \\ \hline
**RasMux** & & & \\ \hline RasMuxNear & 1804 & 51 & Current increase \\ \hline \end{tabular}

### Table 2.

**Conclusions.** The NIEL radiation damage of the RasLed and RasCam is a clear function of the integrated neutron dose. When irradiated with the Atlas Muon Barrel Required Dose of NIEL (6 x 10\({}^{+11}\) n.cm\({}^{-2}\)), the light output of the RasLed is reduced by 4 - 10 percent, and the sensitivity of the RasCam is reduced by 1 - 6 percent. At this dose, the RasMux does not show any damage.

Images of the test bench system were still analysable. This system received a dose of 8.5 times the Atlas Muon Barrel Required Dose of NIEL.

## 4 The SEE results

**The Cyclone 2001 test set up.**

In Cyclone, the items to be tested are placed in a beam of 40 MeV protons. The diameter of the beam is 9 cm. We placed single printed circuit boards in the beam: the radiation behind the board will be too much disturbed for a useful test of a second board. We irradiated the components first at low rate (10\({}^{7}\) protons. cm\({}^{-2}\). s\({}^{-1}\), 40 MeV eq.), for a period of 10 minutes. No SEEs were seen, so the luminosity was increased by a factor 30 (3. 10\({}^{8}\) protons. cm \({}^{-2}\). s\({}^{-1}\)). The TID dose rate due to this irradiation equals 26 Gy/minute or 1500 Gy/hour. We irradiated our components during 15 minutes, collecting 400 Gy. At this dose, the TID damage is noticeable (see chapter? on TID damage).

The integrated SEE dose equals 2.7. 10\({}^{11}\) proton. cm\({}^{-2}\), or 5.7 times the Atlas Muon Barrel Required Dose of SEE.

**SEEs in RasCam**. We irradiated two RasCams, one after the other, with their power constantly on (for RasCams, the ratio of power ON and power OFF in ATLAS is only 1 per mille). The I2C bus was activated from both sides. No SEE was observed. The radiation damage after the test corresponds to the previously measured TID damage for an integrated dose of 400 Gy: an increase in dark current and a loss of sensitivity, shown in fig.5.

**SEEs in RasLed**. The only potentially destructive SEE in a RasLed card could be a short circuit of more than 4 out of 9 LEDs. Nothing happened during the irradiation period in which the RasLed collected 10 times the Atlas Muon Barrel Required Dose of SEE. After the irradiation, the light output was unchanged, as expected for a TID dose of 400 Gy.

**SEEs in RasMux**. Due to its size ( 20 x 9 cm\({}^{2}\)) we irradiated the RasMux in two steps of half the board each. During the irradiation, we powered the RasMux: in ATLAS, the duty cycle is only 2 percent.

During the irradiation of the first half, we noticed an increase of the power current (integrated dose at that moment: 10\({}^{11}\) p. cm\({}^{-2}\), or 130 Gy). We switched off the power of the RasMux, while leaving the proton beam ON. We left the RasMux off for two minutes. With power ON, the power overcurrent had decreased to half the previous value. During the next power ON period, the power current increased again.

During the irradiation of the 2\({}^{\mathrm{nd}}\) half of RasMux, the power current increase continued during the periods that the power was on. Furthermore, the communication over the I2C bus was disrupted frequently.

After two weeks, the functioning of the RasMux was analysed: it turned out that one chip was broken (Philips 74HCT S94) It was irradiated twice due its central position on the board. It was the same chip that caused the problems during final moments in the Pagure TID tests. We believe that this chip is sensitive to very high dose rates. During the test in Cyclone, the TID dose rate was 22 times higher than in Pagure. The damage of the corresponding chip during the irradiation in Pagure has vanished completely.

A 2\({}^{\mathrm{nd}}\) identical chip on the board, irradiated only once, survived the Cyclone test.

**Conclusions**. The RasLed and RasCam did not show any SEE effects during the irradiation with 2.7. 10\({}^{11}\) protons/cm2 (E\({}_{\rm p}\) = 40 MeV), or 5.7 times the Atlas Muon Barrel Required Dose of SEE. After 11 times this dose, one Philips 74HCT S94 chip broke. The fact that this chip has suffered earlier from fast TID irradiation in Pagure, and that a 2\({}^{\rm nd}\) chip of the same type survived 10 times the irradiation, suggests that this damage was not due to destructive SEE(s), but due to the effects of a high TID dose rate.

## 5 Accelerator environment radiation results

**CERN/LHC RADWG 2000 test set up**

A RASNIK system on a test bench was placed in the RADWG irradiation facility, together with a 2\({}^{\mathrm{nd}}\) RasLed card. During this period, images were taken and recorded. The RasCam received 599 Gy and the light sources both received 635 Gy. Both received a fast neutron dose of 40 x 10\({}^{11}\) n. cm\({}^{-2}\) (1 MeV eq.). These doses correspond to 1.8, 1.9 and 6.6 times the the Atlas Muon Barrel Required Dose.

On April 11, 2001, the performance of the RasCam and RasLed was tested.

**Radiation damage of RasLed**. The RasLed light output was simply measured by comparing the light level of RASNIK images taken with the irradiated RasLed and with a fresh, non-irradiated RasLed. For this purpose, the gain and shutter time of the image sensor were fixed. There was no difference observable.

**Radiation damage of RasCam.** The radiation damage of the RasCam image sensor becomes well visible in a 'worst case BOL aperture' set up, from which an image is shown in fig.6. Fig.7 shows an image from the same set up, but with the LEDs switched off. The non-zero background (being the sum of the increased dark current and the always present background light) is very clear. Fig.8 shows the image of fig.6 with the background of fig.7 subtracted, and with the brilliance and contrast increased.

This image passes the analysis routine from the Brandeis University, written by K.

Hashemi: the result is graphically shown in the image. The Brandeis routine is known to be more powerful for vague images than the NIKHEF standard routine.

**Conclusions**

After irradiation with a factor 1.9 and 6.6 higher than the Atlas Muon Barrel Required TID and NIEL Dose, respectively, in the RADWG test site, the RasLed card does not show any reduction in light output. This is not in line with the damage seen in TID and NIEL tests. Possible explanations are: 1) a much lower local (neutron) dose due to the distance between experiment and point of dosimetry and 2) the recovery of the LEDs with time.

The functionality of the (video) RasCam card was maintained throughout the irradiation period. It shows, however, a clear increase in dark current after 599 Gy and 40 x 10\({}^{11}\) n. cm\({}^{-2}\) (1 MeV eq.). Images taken from the irradiated sensor were analysable after background subtraction. The damage of RasCam is worse than one would expect from exclusive TID and NIEL damage measurements. This may be explained by additional radiation damage due to thermal and epithermal neutrons, X-rays, \(\gamma\)-rays and other secondary fixed-target radiation products.

**CERN/LHC RADWG 2001 test set up**

The RASNIK test bench and RasMux were placed close to one another, with a common distance to the target that acted as radiation source. More RasCams and RasLeds were placed nearer to and further away from the target.

The RasMux and the RasCam and RasLed in the test bench received 1800 Gy and 75 x 10\({}^{11}\) neutrons (1 MeV eq), with an uncertainty of 30 percent. This corresponds to 5.5 and 12.5 times the Atlas Muon Barrel Required TID and NIEL Dose, respectively. The integrated dose of the components further away from, and closer to the target, is not known.

**Radiation damage of RasLeds.** The light output, in terms of the fraction of a fresh RasLed card is given in the table 3. The reduction of the light output for the 'naked' RasLeds is very large compared to the RasLed in the test bench. This could be due to a difference in shielding (the shielding by the test bench can be compared to the situation in the Atlas Muon Spectrometer), or due to large differences in local doses.

After the irradiation, the RasLeds continue to recover.

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|} \hline
**RasLed name** & 
\begin{tabular}{l} **Performance loss** \\ **(\% of fresh)** \\ \end{tabular} \\ \hline RasLed Proche 1 & 4.1 \\ \hline RasLed Proche 2 & 6.2 \\ \hline RasLed Chez Systeme 1 & 5.2 \\ \hline RasLed Chez Systeme 2 & 3.7 \\ \hline RasLed Chez Systeme 3 & 3.0 \\ \hline RasLed in Test Bench & 30. \\ \hline RasLed Loin 1 & 10.6 \\ \hline RasLed Loin 2 & 11.3 \\ \hline \end{tabular}

_Table 3._

**Radiation damage of RasCams.** The images from the test bench system (for this measurement in the 'worst case BOL aperture'geometry) were analysable, after background subtraction and brilliance increase, by the Brandeis image analysis routine. Like the RasLeds, the radiation damage of all other (naked) RasCams was worse, but none of them broke (see table 4).

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|} \hline
**RasCam name** & **Status** & \multicolumn{2}{c|}{**Regulator (V)**} \\ \cline{3-4}  & & **17.12.'01** & **4.2.'02** \\ \hline RasCam Proche 1 & \begin{tabular}{l} Analysable image, vertical \\ bars \\ \end{tabular} & 4.12 & 4.11 \\ \hline RasCam Proche 2 & \begin{tabular}{l} Vague image \\ \end{tabular} & 4.0 & 3.96 \\ \hline RasCam Chez Systeme 1 & \begin{tabular}{l} Vague image, vertical bars \\ \end{tabular} & 3.64 & 3.74 \\ \hline RasCam Chez Systeme 2 & \begin{tabular}{l} Vague image, vertical bars \\ \end{tabular} & 3.64 & 3.72 \\ \hline RasCam Chez Systeme 3 & \begin{tabular}{l} Vague image \\ \end{tabular} & 3.44 & 3.48 \\ \hline RasCam in Test Bench & \begin{tabular}{l} Analysable image \\ \end{tabular} & - & - \\ \hline RasCam Loin 1 & \begin{tabular}{l} Analysable image \\ \end{tabular} & 4.25 & 5 * \\ \hline RasCam Loin 2 & 
\begin{tabular}{l} Analysable image \\ \end{tabular} & 4.35 & 4.38 \\ \hline \multicolumn{3}{|l|}{*: Regulator and I\({}^{2}\)C buffer were replaced} \\ \hline \end{tabular}

_Table 4._The communication over the I\({}^{2}\)C bus was affected for some of the tested RasCams: messages from the RasMux to RasCams were unaffected, but messages from some RasCams were not readable by the RasMux. This would not affect the operation of RASNIK in ATLAS. The effect is due to a change of the output of a regulator, as is shown in table 4, and to a change in the I\({}^{2}\)C buffer (82B715).

**Damage of the RasMux.** We monitored the current consumption of the RasMux unit. We noticed a small crease after the irradiation. It was found that the Power-Up Reset chip (PCF1252-2), taking care of a well-defined start-up situation of all relevant flip-flops and other registers, had changed its nominal threshold value (4.25 V) had changed to 3.95 V, which is still fine for CMOS circuits. After 50 days its threshold value came back to 4.35 V.

**Conclusions.** The complete RASNIK system formed by the RasMux and the test bench system has been operational throughout the entire period of irradiation in which a dose was collected of 5.5 times the TID, and 12.5 times the NIEL Atlas Muon Barrel Required Dose. The 'naked' RasCams and RasLeds suffered more damage; this may be due to a stronger local dose, or to the absence of shielding.

## 6 The effect of annealing RasCams and RasLeds

### Performance prior to annealing

On June 25 and 26, 2002, the performance of the irradiated RasCams and RasLeds was measured in the standard test bench.

This happened 16 months, 11 months, 10 months and 9 months after the TID, NIEL, SEE and CERN/LHC irradiation test, respectively.

For each RasCam the best gain setting was determined (maximum gain while image pixel content never exceeds 255) and an image was recorded.

The light output of the RasLeds was simply compared to a fresh non-irradiated one.

### Annealing procedure

The RasCams and RasLeds were placed in an oven. During 46 hours they were exposed to a temperature of 80 deg C.

### Results of the RasLeds

In fig. 9 the light output with respect to a fresh led, prior to annealing is plotted with the corresponding figure after annealing. Without effect, the plotted points would be located on the 45 deg. line going through the origin. None of the points are situated below this line, so annealing either improves the light output or leaves it unchanged.

### Results of the RasCams

After the annealing procedure, images were recorded of the RasCams, using the same gain settings as before. Images taken before and after the annealing are shown in fig. 10.

We conclude that annealing either improves the image quality, or does not change it. In none of the cases the image quality got worse.

### Conclusions

The performance of RasCams and RasLeds is never worse after annealing. This suggests that the are no 'hidden' damages present in the irradiated components. The need for the 'low dose rate' safety factor SF\({}_{\text{ldr}}\) (\(=5\)) applied for TID irradiation is not required. The margin for the RasLed and RasCams for this kind of radiation damage is therefore larger with the same factor.

## 7 Conclusions

The radiation hardness of all RASNIK system components is sufficient to survive the Atlas Muon Barrel Required Dose on TID, NIEL and SEE radiation. At this required dose, the damage is limited to a small reduction of the efficiency of the light source or sensitivity.

The components still function, in general, at a dose which is 4 - 10 times higher: then the efficiency decreases such that video images from systems with a large distance between mask and sensor become dark and grey. The RASNIK systems remain functioning after an order of magnitude higher dose, in terms of providing video images.

At a high dose rate, the Philips 74HCTS94 chip in the RasMux starts to malfunction: this damage disappears with time. When irradiated too fast for too long, the chip breaks.

In the RasCam the 78L05 regulator and the 82B715 I\({}^{2}\)C buffer are the weakest points, but sufficient radiation hard.

For most of the RasLed and RasCams, annealing reduced the radiation damage. Since annealing never worsened the damage, we conclude that no 'low dose rate' effects occurred and that the safety factor SF\({}_{\text{ldr}}\)= 5 is not applicable. This increases the safety margin for TID irradiation.

We conclude that the present RASNIK components are safe to be applied in the Atlas Muon Barrel Spectrometer.
