The LHC will allow QCD studies to be performed at very high energy, including precision tests and measurements in an as yet unexplored kinematic region. A detailed understanding of QCD is important for almost all physics processes to be studied at the LHC, as the production mechanisms are mostly controlled by QCD. This contribution presents an overview of various measurements of QCD-related processes to be performed at the LHC, based mostly on final states containing high \(p_{T}\) leptons, photons and jets.

## 1 Introduction

QCD constitutes the least well tested part of the Standard Model and thus QCD measurements at the LHC in proton-proton collisions at \(\sqrt{s}=14\) TeV are of interest 'per se'. In addition, the knowledge of QCD related processes is essential for many other physics studies at the LHC (such as precision measurements as well as searches for new physics), as QCD controls the production for almost all processes of interest.

A more detailed discussion (than the brief overview presented here) of the experimental aspects can be found in Chapter 15 of [1]. For a summary of recent theoretical developments, the proceedings of two recent workshops [2, 3] are recommended. In the following, after a brief description of the ATLAS detector, examples for measurements related to final states containing high \(p_{T}\) jets, photons and leptons will be discussed, followed by a discussion on measurements of minimum bias events and of diffractive scattering.

## 2 The ATLAS detector

The ATLAS detector is a multi-purpose \(4\pi\) detector (coverage up to \(|\eta|=5\)), designed to operate at the LHC design luminosity of \(10^{34}\) cm\({}^{-2}\) s\({}^{-1}\). At these conditions, on average 23 inelastic events ('minimum bias events') occur at each bunch crossing. Most of the QCD related measurements are expected to be performed however during the first years of operation at lower luminosities (\(\leq 10^{33}\) cm\({}^{-2}\) s\({}^{-1}\), where on average only \(\leq 2.3\) minimum bias events are expected per bunch crossing).

The interaction region is surrounded by silicon pixel and silicon strip detectors, followed by a transition radiation tracker (TRT), providing robust tracking and precise vertex measurement for \(|\eta|<2.5\). Outside the tracking detector, a 2 T solenoid is located in front of the calorimetry, which consists of a LAr calorimeter for the e.m. part and scintillator-tile based and LAr based calorimeters for the hadronic part. The calorimetric coverage extends up to \(|\eta|=5\), where the very finely segmented e.m. part is restricted to \(|\eta|<2.5\). Muons are measured (for \(|\eta|<2.7\)) in an air-core toroid system with muon detectors. More details about the detector and the expected performance can be found in [1].

## 3 Jet physics

The measurement of jet production will allow to access smallest distances due to the large cross-section (in comparison with other hard-scattering processes discussed below). Jet production is induced by intial states containing both quarks and gluons. The statistical uncertainties will be small, e.g. for an integrated luminosity of only 30 fb\({}^{-1}\) (to be reached after 3 years of initial data taking), more than \(4\cdot 10^{5}\) (\(3\cdot 10^{3}\) or 40) events are expected with a jet of \(E_{T}>1\) TeV (\(>2\) TeV or \(>3\) TeV).

Important systematic uncertainties are e.g. how to best define a jet (jet algorithm), the knowledge of the energy scale (which will be the dominating source at very large values of \(E_{T}\)) and the effect of the underlying event. The left part of Fig. 1 shows the expected jet energy resolution, which is well described by a parametrisation of \(\sigma/E=50/\sqrt{E}\%\oplus 3\%\) (when ignoring losses due to a finite cone size). The knowledge of the absolute energy scale is expected to be accurate to 1 %, using a variety of physics processes for in-situ calibration.

An example for the expected inclusive jet cross-section is shown in the middle part of Fig. 1, for three choices of pseudo-rapidity ranges, indicating the ultimate possible reach in transverse

The circles indicate the expected statistical accuracy for the cross-section measurement with an integrated luminosity of 300 fb\({}^{-1}\). _Right:_ Rejection against jets for photon identification (with an efficiency as shown in the left part of Fig. 2) as a function of the jet \(E_{T}\) at low and high luminosity.

energy. A measurement of di-jet production allows to constrain the fractional momenta \(x_{1,2}\) of the partons entering the hard scattering for the scale \(Q^{2}\) (related to \(E_{T}^{2}\)). The kinematic reach for \(x_{i}>0.1\) extends to \(Q^{2}>10^{7}\) GeV\({}^{2}\). For \(Q^{2}=10^{5}\) GeV\({}^{2}\) (i.e. above the HERA kinematical limit), values of \(x_{i}\) down to \(10^{-3}\) are covered.

Jet production could possibly be used to determine the strong coupling constant \(\alpha_{s}\) over a wide range of scales, reaching up to scales of \({\cal O}\)(TeV). For inclusive jet production, there is however a strong correlation between \(\alpha_{s}\) and the gluon density, which might be avoided by extracting \(\alpha_{s}\) from the ratio of 3-jet to 2-jet production.

## 4 Photon physics

Direct photon production is one of the processes to obtain information on the gluon density. The experimental challenge is to reduce background from jets (containing e.g. a leading \(\pi^{0}\)), which can fake a photon signature. The expected ratio of the inclusive photon cross-section to the inclusive jet cross-section has a value of about \(10^{-3}\). As shown in the right part of Fig. 1, the achievable jet rejection is larger than \(3\cdot 10^{3}\) for values of \(E_{T}>40\) GeV, thus providing a good signal-to-background ratio. For this rejection, achieved mostly due to the finely segmented LAr calorimeter, the photon identification efficieny is more than 80 % (at low luminosity), as shown in the left part of Fig. 2. Photons with \(E_{T}>40\) GeV (i.e. \(Q^{2}>10^{3}\) GeV\({}^{2}\)) allow to reach values of Bjorken-\(x\) down to \(5\cdot 10^{-4}\) (for \(|\eta|<2.5\)). Statistics will not be a problem, as for example more than \(2\cdot 10^{4}\) events with a photon of \(E_{T}>500\) GeV are expected for 30 fb\({}^{-1}\).

A study of the ratio of the inclusive photon cross-section to the cross-section for inclusive jet production (as a function of \(E_{T}\)) could allow one to determine the strong coupling constant at a well defined scale [2]. More studies are needed (as in the case of jet production) to assess the expected uncertainties.

## 5 Lepton physics

The measurement of Drell-Yan lepton pair production and the production of \(W\) and \(Z\) bosons (with a leptonic decay to electrons or muons) will allow one to constrain the quark and anti-quark densities of the proton at a scale given by the invariant mass of the lepton pair (respectively by the \(W\) / \(Z\) boson mass) over a wide range in Bjorken \(x\).

In case of electrons, the experimental challenge is to reject background from jets faking an electron signature. By using a combination of the shower shape in the finely segmented LAr

calorimeter, of the search for matching tracks and of the transition radiation information from the TRT, a rejection of up to \(5\cdot 10^{5}\) can be achieved. The absolute energy scale for leptons is expected to be determined with an accuracy of 0.1 % (or better).

As an example, the measurement of \(Z\) boson production allows one to cover the range of \(3\cdot 10^{-4}<x<0.1\) in Bjorken-\(x\) at \(Q^{2}=8\cdot 10^{3}\) GeV\({}^{2}\) (for comparison: the HERA collider is kinematically limited to \(x>0.1\) at \(Q^{2}>10^{4}\) GeV\({}^{2}\)). Again, the LHC will provide huge samples: During one year at \(10^{33}\) cm\({}^{-2}\) s\({}^{-1}\) about \(10^{7}\) (\(10^{6}\)) events with \(W\to e\nu\) (\(Z\to e^{+}e^{-}\)) will be produced.

## 6 Minimum bias events

A detailed understanding of the structure of minimum bias events is needed in order to reduce dependences on models used to determine their effects at the design luminosity. As the middle and the right part of Fig. 2 show, an extrapolation from Tevatron energies to LHC energies leads to a difference of a factor of 2 in the expected charged particle density in the central region (for models which are able to describe CDF data). Each minimum bias event is expected to contribute from charged particles only about \(0.5-1\) GeV per unit rapidity and unit azimuth to the transverse energy.

## 7 Diffraction

An extension of the ATLAS detector in the forward region (beyond pseudo-rapidities of \(|\eta|=5\)) is presently under study, in order to increase the acceptance for charged particles from inelastic interactions (possibly including a momentum measurement) and to provide tagging and measurement of leading protons (from elastic and diffractive interactions). The detectors for the latter task would be located more than 100 m away from the interaction point in the LHC tunnel, the former detectors would be installed inside the experimental cavern.

Besides allowing measurements of e.g. the total cross-section and of elastic scattering over a wide range in momentum transfer \(t\), and of the partonic structure of diffractive processes, such an extension would also allow more detailed studies of the properties of rapidity gaps, which might be used as tools for searches.

## 8 Conclusions

The LHC will provide an unprecedented sample of events with high \(p_{T}\) signatures for QCD studies. The challenge will be in performing precision measurements of e.g. the strong coupling constant and the proton structure in as yet uncovered kinematical regions. An increase of the ATLAS potential for QCD studies could be achieved by extending the detector in the forward region, in order to increase the acceptance for charged particles from inelastic interactions and to detect leading protons from elastic or diffractive scattering.
