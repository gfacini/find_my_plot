Extrapolation of \(E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}\) + jet search results to an integrated luminosity of 300 fb\({}^{-1}\) and 3000 fb\({}^{-1}\)

The ATLAS Collaboration

###### Abstract

This note presents a study of the impact of different systematic uncertainty scenarios on the sensitivity of the ATLAS search in the final state with at least one jet and large missing transverse momentum (monojet signature) to weakly-interacting massive particles (WIMPs). A simplified model in which WIMPs are pair-produced from the \(s\)-channel exchange of an axial-vector mediator is used as a benchmark for the sensitivity of the analysis to dark matter. The sensitivity prospectives are evaluated by extrapolating simulated results obtained by a recent ATLAS search based on 36 fb\({}^{-1}\) of \(pp\) collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV to integrated luminosities of 300 fb\({}^{-1}\) and 3000 fb\({}^{-1}\).

## 1 Introduction

The final state with at least one jet and large missing transverse momentum (\(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\) + jet) is a key channel for the search for dark matter at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) [1; 2; 3]. Different theoretical frameworks [4; 5; 6] beyond the Standard Model predict the production of pairs of Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs) [7; 8] in association with hadronic jets, coming from initial state radiation, which can be used to discriminate signal from background events. This process is conveniently described with simplified benchmark models, which assume the existence of a massive mediator of the interaction between the initial state partons and the WIMPs. Depending on the spin-parity state of the mediator and on its couplings, different sensitivity is achieved at the LHC compared to direct and indirect detection experiments, with differing complementarity between LHC search channels, namely those with missing transverse momentum and those with resonant particles.

In the upcoming years, the LHC and the ATLAS experiment [9] will undergo significant upgrades. During the first phase, from 2021 to 2023 (Run-3), the ATLAS detector is expected to collect an integrated luminosity of \(300\,\mathrm{fb}^{-1}\) whereas in the second phase, from 2026 to 2036 (Run-4), the total amount of data corresponding of \(3000\,\mathrm{fb}^{-1}\) is foreseen. This unprecedented luminosity, which will be crucial for precision measurements in the Higgs sector and for increasing the discovery potential at the energy frontier, will be collected in two steps.

The goal of this study is to evaluate the impact of different assumed systematic uncertainty scenarios on the expected sensitivity to dark matter in the \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\) + jet channel. The evaluation is based on the extrapolation to higher luminosity of the limits published by the ATLAS Collaboration with \(36\,\mathrm{fb}^{-1}\) of \(pp\) collisions at a center-of-mass energy \(\sqrt{s}=13\,\mathrm{TeV}\)[10]; the same center-of-mass energy is assumed in all scenarios. A simplified benchmark model is chosen to illustrate the WIMP discovery potential, where Dirac fermion WIMPs, \(\chi\), are pair-produced from the \(s\)-channel exchange of a spin-1 mediator, \(Z_{A}\), with axial-vector couplings. The model is defined by four free parameters: the mediator mass (\(m_{Z_{A}}\)), the WIMP mass (\(m_{\chi}\)), the coupling strength of the flavour-universal mediator-quark interaction (\(g_{q}\)), and the coupling strength of the mediator-WIMP interaction (\(g_{\chi}\)). The width of the mediator is assumed to be minimal, as detailed in Refs. [5; 6].

This note is organized as follows. An overview of the ATLAS detector is provided in Sec. 2. Sec. 3 describes the simulation of Monte Carlo (MC) events used for these projections. Sec. 4 describes the event selection, while the methodology used to extrapolate limits to a luminosity of \(300\,\mathrm{fb}^{-1}\) and \(3000\,\mathrm{fb}^{-1}\) is discussed in Sec. 5. Results are discussed in Sec. 6, and conclusions are drawn in Sec. 7.

## 2 The ATLAS detector and the LHC programme

ATLAS [9] is a multi-purpose particle detector with a forward-backward symmetric cylindrical geometry. It covers almost the whole solid angle around the collision point with layers of tracking detectors immersed in a 2 T axial magnetic field produced by a solenoid, a calorimeter system which provides both the electromagnetic and hadronic energy measurements and a muon spectrometer which measures the deflection of muons in the magnetic field provided by large superconducting air-core toroidal magnets. During Run-2 (2015-2018) an integrated luminosity close to \(150\,\mathrm{fb}^{-1}\) has been collected with an instantaneous luminosity of \(2.1\times 10^{34}\,\mathrm{cm}^{-2}\mathrm{s}^{-1}\) and an average number of collisions per bunch crossing \(<\mu>\sim 35\).

After a long shutdown (2019-2020), collisions will restart in Run-3 at the instantaneous luminosity of \(2.1\times 10^{34}\,\mathrm{cm}^{-2}\mathrm{s}^{-1}\) and \(<\mu>\sim 60\). The integrated luminosity which is expected to be collected at the end of Run-3 corresponds to \(300\,\mathrm{fb}^{-1}\) at the centre-of-mass-energy to \(\sqrt{s}=14\,\mathrm{TeV}\).

During the long shutdown between 2024-2026, the accelerator is foreseen to be upgraded to the High-Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC). It is currently expected to begin its operations in the second half of 2026, with a nominal levelled instantaneous luminosity of \(7.5\times 10^{34}\,\mathrm{cm}^{-2}\mathrm{s}^{-1}\) at \(\sqrt{s}=14\,\mathrm{TeV}\). This will lead to an average number of approximately 200 inelastic \(pp\) collisions per bunch-crossing. This programme aims to provide a total integrated luminosity of \(3000\,\mathrm{fb}^{-1}\) by 2036. Upgrades to the ATLAS detector and the trigger system are planned in order to adapt the experiment to the new challenging conditions foreseen for LHC during Run-3 and Run-4 [11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21]. A detailed description of the expected performance of the ATLAS detector at the HL-LHC is addressed in Ref. [22].

## 3 Simulation

The same signal and background MC simulation setup as Ref. [10] is used in this study. Proton-proton collision events are simulated with \(\sqrt{s}=13\,\mathrm{TeV}\); unless otherwise indicated, samples are processed with the full ATLAS detector simulation [23] based on Geant 4[24]. Pile-up effects are taken into account by overlaying simulated minimum-bias events from Pythia 8.205 [25] onto the hard-scattering process, distributed according to the frequency in \(36\,\mathrm{fb}^{-1}\) data collected in 2015 and 2016. No correction for the different detector setup and pile-up conditions expected during Run-3 and the HL-LHC phase is applied assuming that similar performance to the ones gotten during Run-2 can be achieved in this channel.

### Signal

Signal events are simulated in Powheg-Box v2 [26, 27, 28] (revision 3049) using the DMV model of WIMP pair production introduced in Ref. [29], at next-to-leading order (NLO) in the strong coupling constant \(\alpha_{\mathrm{S}}\). The mediator couplings are set to \(g_{q}=0.25\) and \(g_{\chi}=1\), and its propagator is described by a Breit-Wigner distribution. Events are generated using the NNPDF30 [30] parton distribution functions (PDFs) and interfaced to Pythia 8.205 with the A14 set of tuned parameters (tune) [31] for parton showering, hadronization and the underlying event.

A grid of samples is produced for WIMP masses ranging from \(1\,\mathrm{GeV}\) to \(1\,\mathrm{TeV}\) and mediator masses between \(10\,\mathrm{GeV}\) and \(10\,\mathrm{TeV}\). For a few values of \(m_{Z_{A}}\), additional samples with respect to those used in Ref. [10] are produced at generator-level only, in order to increase the granularity of the expected exclusion limit contours in the region where the mediator decay in WIMP pairs is on the mass shell. Full-simulation events have been used to validate the stability of acceptance and selection efficiency effects for on-shell events at fixed \(m_{Z_{A}}\).

### Backgrounds

\(W/Z\)+jets production processes are simulated using the Sherpa 2.2.1 [32] event generator. Matrix elements (ME) are calculated for up to two partons at NLO and up to four at LO using OpenLoops [33] and Comix [34], and merged with the Sherpa parton shower (PS) [35] using the ME+PS@NLO prescription [36] and the NNPDF3.0NNLO [30] PDF set.

A reweighting of the \(W\)+jets and \(Z\)+jets MC predictions is performed in order to account for higher-order QCD and electroweak corrections as described in Ref. [37], where parton-level predictions for \(W/Z\)+jets production, including NLO QCD corrections and NLO electroweak corrections supplemented by Sudakov logarithms at two loops, are provided as a function of the vector-boson \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\). More details on the procedure are provided in Ref. [10].

The \(t\bar{t}\) and single top quarks in the \(Wt\)-channel and \(s\)-channel processes are generated by Powheg-Box v2 [38] with CT10 [39] PDFs whereas electroweak \(t\)-channel single-top-quark events are generated using the Powheg-Box v1 event generator. The four-flavour scheme has been set to calculate NLO matrix elements, with the CT10 four-flavour PDF set. The parton shower, hadronization, and underlying event are simulated using Pythia 8.205 with the A14 tune. The top-quark mass is set to \(172.5\,\mathrm{Ge\kern-1.0ptV}\). In order to estimate the effects of the choice of matrix-element event generator and parton-shower algorithm, alternative sample based on MadGraph5_aMC@NLO v2.2.1 [40] interfaced to Herwig++ (v2.7.1) [41] are used.

Diboson processes (\(WW\), \(WZ\), and \(ZZ\) production) are simulated by Sherpa 2.2.1 or Sherpa 2.1.1 with NNPDF3.0NNLO or CT10nlo PDFs, respectively, and normalized to NLO pQCD predictions [42]. Further diboson samples based on Powheg-Box [27] interfaced to Pythia 8.186 with CT10 PDFs are used for studies of systematic uncertainties.

## 4 Event reconstruction and event selection

Jets are reconstructed from energy deposits in the calorimeters, using the anti-\(k_{t}\) algorithm[43; 44] with the radius parameter \(R=0.4\). Jets with \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>20\,\mathrm{Ge\kern-1.0ptV}\) and \(|\eta|<2.8\) are considered in the analysis; for central jets (\(|\eta|<2.4\)) with \(p_{\mathrm{T}}<50\,\mathrm{Ge\kern-1.0ptV}\), additional requirements based on the inner detector information[45] are applied to remove jets originating from pile-up collisions1. Additionally, jets with \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>30\,\mathrm{Ge\kern-1.0ptV}\) and \(|\eta|<2.5\) are identified as \(b\)-jets if they pass the requirements of a multi-variate algorithm[46; 47] with 60% efficiency, as determined in a simulated sample of \(t\bar{t}\) events.

Footnote 1: Similar performance in terms of jet identification and pile-up suppression reached during Run-2 are assumed in this context even in the challenging pile-up regimes expected in Run-3 and Run-4.

Electrons are required to have \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>20\,\mathrm{Ge\kern-1.0ptV}\), \(|\eta|<2.47\), to satisfy the 'Loose' selection criteria described in Ref. [48] and to pass track-based isolation requirements. In case an electron overlaps within \(\Delta R=\sqrt{(\Delta\eta)^{2}+(\Delta\phi)^{2}}<0.2\) with a jet with \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>30\,\mathrm{Ge\kern-1.0ptV}\), the electron is discarded (retained) if the jet is (not) \(b\)-tagged, while the other is removed. Electrons separated by \(0.2<\Delta R<0.4\) from any remaining jet are removed.

Muons are reconstructed combining the information from the muon spectrometer and the inner detector. They are required to have \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>10\,\mathrm{Ge\kern-1.0ptV}\), \(|\eta|<2.5\) and to pass the 'Medium' identification requirements described in Ref. [49]. In case a muon overlaps within \(\Delta R<0.4\) with a jet with \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>30\,\mathrm{Ge\kern-1.0ptV}\), the jet (muon) is discarded if the number of tracks with \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>500\,\mathrm{Me\kern-1.0ptV}\) associated to the jet is less than (at least) three, while the other is removed.

The missing transverse momentum vector \(\mathbf{p}_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\) is reconstructed using all energy deposits in the calorimeter with \(|\eta|<4.9\); its magnitude is denoted as \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\). Clusters associated with electrons, photons or jets with \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>20\,\mathrm{Ge\kern-1.0ptV}\) make use of the corresponding calibrations. Softer jets and clusters not associated with electrons, photons or jets are calibrated using tracking information[50]. In this analysis, \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\) is not corrected for the presence of muons.

Events are pre-selected if they have at least one reconstructed primary vertex, with at least two associated tracks, and \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}250\GeV\). At least one jet with \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>250\GeV\) and \(|\eta|<2.4\) must have been reconstructed, together with up to three additional jets with \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>30\GeV\) and \(|\eta|<2.8\). In order to suppress background from multi-jet events, jets must have an azimuthal angle separation with respect to the missing transverse momentum direction \(\Delta\phi(\mathrm{jet},\mathbf{p}_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}})>0.4\). Jet quality criteria, based on quality requirements on calorimetric variables and on the jet charged particle fraction, are applied to suppress non-collision background and calorimeter noise.

Five regions are used in the analysis: a signal region, where only events without electrons or muons are selected, and four control regions enriched in \(W\to\mu\nu,t\bar{t}\), \(W\to e\nu\) and \(Z\to\mu\mu\) events, respectively. Events containing exactly one muon and no electron, and with a transverse mass \(m_{\mathrm{T}}=\sqrt{2p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\ell}p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\nu}[1-\cos(\phi ^{\ell}-\phi^{\nu})]}\) of the lepton-\(\mathbf{p}_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\) system between 30 and 100, are assigned to the \(W\to\mu\nu\) (\(t\bar{t}\)) control region if they have zero (at least one) \(b\)-tagged jet. Similarly, events with exactly two muons, and with an invariant mass of the di-muon system between 66 and 116, are assigned to the \(Z\to\mu\mu\) control region. Finally, events with exactly one isolated electron with \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>30\GeV\) (reconstructed outside the transition region between the barrel and endcaps of the electromagnetic calorimeter, \(1.37<|\eta|<1.52\)), no other electron or muon, and with \(30<m_{\mathrm{T}}<100\GeV\), are assigned to the \(W\to e\nu\) region; in this region, the \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\) calculation is corrected by subtracting from \(\mathbf{p}_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\) the contribution from the electron cluster in the calorimeter. Trigger requirements based on the missing transverse momentum, which make no use of muon information at trigger level, and fully efficient for \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}>250\GeV\), are used for the signal region and for the \(W\to\mu\nu\), \(t\bar{t}\) and \(Z\to\mu\mu\) control regions; dedicated single-electron triggers are used for the \(W\to e\nu\)-enriched control region. A summary of the signal region selection cuts is listed in Table 1.

## 5 Methodology

The discriminating variable of the search is \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\); 17 bins are used, as defined in Table 2, which corresponds to an improved coverage in \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\) with respect to the 10 bin scenario of Ref. [10]. The lower end of the last

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|} \hline Category & Selection criteria \\ \hline \hline trigger & fully efficient at \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}>250\GeV\) \\ vertex & \(\geq 1\) vertex with \(N_{\mathrm{trk}}\geq 2\) \\ pile-up suppression & JVT \(>0.64\,(20<p_{\mathrm{T}}<50\GeV,|\eta|<2.4)\) \\ jet cleaning & \(Loose\), \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>30\GeV\), \(|\eta|<2.8\) \\ electron veto & \(Loose\), \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>20\GeV\), \(|\eta|<2.47\) \\ muon veto & \(Medium\), \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>10\GeV\), \(|\eta|<2.5\) \\ jet multiplicity & \(N_{\mathrm{jet}}\leq 4\,(p_{\mathrm{T}}>30\GeV,|\eta|<2.8)\) \\ multi-jet suppression & \(\Delta\phi(\mathrm{jet},E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}})>0.4\) \\ leading jet & \(Tight\), \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>250\GeV\), \(|\eta|<2.4\) \\ \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\) & \(>250\GeV\) \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 1: Summary of the cuts applied to define the signal region.

\(E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}\) bin, \(1.6\,{\rm TeV}\), is chosen in order to keep a similar level of uncertainty on signal and control region yields for \(300\,{\rm fb}^{-1}\) and \(3000\,{\rm fb}^{-1}\) as in the Run-2 search.

Differently from Ref. [10], the non-collision and multi-jet backgrounds, whose extrapolation to higher luminosity is non-trivial due to their strong dependence on the details of detector and LHC performance, and which nevertheless give a sub-leading, low-\(E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}\) contribution to the overall background in the signal region, are neglected in this analysis. Additionally, expected event yields for \(W/Z+{\rm jets}\) (\(t\overline{t}\) and single-\(t\)) processes are rescaled by a factor 1.27 (1.06), in order to reflect the observation of the fitted normalisation factors obtained by performing a control regions based fit in an inclusive \(E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}\) bin selection [10].

A simultaneous, binned likelihood fit of a signal plus background model to the simulated \(E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}\) distributions of the five analysis regions is performed. The signal normalisation and two additional normalisation factors, one which rescales the prediction for processes containing \(Z\) and \(W\) bosons produced in association with jets, and one for \(t\overline{t}\) and single-\(t\) production, are free parameters of the fit. Nuisance parameters with gaussian constraints are used to describe the effect of systematic uncertainties on the signal and background \(E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}\) distributions. Correlations of systematic uncertainties across \(E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}\) bins are taken into account.

The different systematic uncertainty scenarios which are tested in this analysis are chosen to reflect the possible improvements in detector performance and in the theoretical modelling of signal and background processes, which could be achieved in the next years thanks to the foreseen detector upgrades and to progress in QCD and EW calculations. Table 3 illustrates the impact of the background uncertainties from Ref. [10], grouped in terms of different sources, on the total background yield in the signal and control regions, as determined from fits of the background-only model to the event yield in inclusive \(E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}\) bins of the four control regions. The systematic uncertainties which take into account limited MC-statistics are neglected in this study. Signal uncertainties affecting acceptance and cross-section are treated separately, and their impact before the fit is summarised in Table 4.

In this context the same systematic uncertainties considered in Ref. [10] are evaluated in the new binning scenarios. Three different scenarios are probed, which differ only by the assumed pre-fit value of uncertainties:

* **standard**: same uncertainties as in Ref. [10];
* **reduced by factor 2**: all pre-fit signal and background uncertainties are reduced by a factor two;
* **reduced by factor 4**: all pre-fit signal and background uncertainties are reduced by a factor four.

## 6 Results

### Exclusion sensitivity

The exclusion limits, obtained with the profile likelihood method [51], for each of the three systematic uncertainty scenarios are plotted in the \((m_{\chi},m_{Z_{A}})\) mass plane in Fig. 1.

The choice of the new binning corresponds to an improvement of about \(100\,\mathrm{GeV}\) in mediator mass reach with respect to the 10 bin scenario.

The plot on the left shows that with a integrated luminosity of \(300\,\mathrm{fb}^{-1}\), and assuming the same uncertainties as in Ref. [10], the 95% CL exclusion contour for \(m_{\chi}=1\,\mathrm{GeV}\) can be extended up to \(m_{Z_{A}}\sim 2.20\,\mathrm{TeV}\). The phase-space that can be probed by reducing by a factor two (four) all systematic uncertainties increases significantly, and the exclusion contour for low \(m_{\chi}\) reaches mediator masses of about \(2.34\) (\(2.43\)).

Similarly, the plot on the right shows that with a luminosity of \(3000\,\mathrm{fb}^{-1}\), and assuming the same uncertainties as in Ref. [10], the 95% CL exclusion contour for \(m_{\chi}=1\,\mathrm{GeV}\) can be extended up to

\(m_{Z_{A}}\sim 2.65\,\mathrm{TeV}\). The excluded region that can be obtained by reducing by a factor two (four) all systematic uncertainties reaches, for low \(m_{\chi}\), mediator masses of about \(2.77\) (\(2.88\)).

Small differences between systematic uncertainty scenarios are observed when approaching the region where the decay of the mediator in two WIMPs is off the mass shell (\(m_{Z_{A}}<2m_{\chi}\)), due to the decrease of the signal cross-section.

The contributions to sensitivity of experimental and theoretical uncertainties are investigated separately in Fig. 2 for \(300\,\mathrm{fb}^{-1}\) and in Fig. 3 for \(3000\,\mathrm{fb}^{-1}\). The left (right) plots show the effect of reducing by a factor two and four the effect of experimental (theoretical) systematic uncertainties on signal and backgrounds. The comparison of limit contours in these different systematic scenarios shows that the major impact to the sensitivity of the monojet search comes from theoretical uncertainties. Among these, \(V\)+jets and diboson uncertainties, as well as theoretical uncertainties on signal processes, are similar in size and give the leading contributions.

### Discovery power

The discovery potential that can be reached with the integrated luminosities of \(300\,\mathrm{fb}^{-1}\) and \(3000\,\mathrm{fb}^{-1}\) is estimated in terms of the \(p\)-value of the background-only hypothesis, \(p_{0}\), evaluated in the asymptotic approximation [51]. For each mass point, \(p_{0}\) is evaluated after injecting the corresponding signal on top of the SM background. Results are shown in Fig. 4 for the different scenarios: contours corresponding to the \(3\sigma\) evidence (\(5\sigma\) discovery) are shown with solid (dashed) lines, for each of the tested systematic uncertainty scenarios.

With an integrated luminosity of \(300\,\mathrm{fb}^{-1}\) (\(3000\,\mathrm{fb}^{-1}\)) the existence of a dark matter signal described by the simplified model with an axial-vector mediator, \(m_{\chi}=1\,\mathrm{GeV}\) and the coupling choice \(g_{\chi}=1\) and

Three contours are shown in each plot, corresponding to the three different systematic uncertainty scenarios: standard (black), reduced by a factor 2 (red) and 4 (green). More details in the text.

The plot on the left (right) shows in black the expected contour assuming the same systematic uncertainties as in Ref. [10], while the scenarios with experimental (theoretical) uncertainties reduced by a factor two and four are shown in blue and green (red and orange), respectively.

The plot on the left (right) shows in black the expected contour assuming the same systematic uncertainties as in Ref. [10], while the scenarios with experimental (theoretical) uncertainties reduced by a factor two and four are shown in blue and green (red and orange), respectively.

\(g_{q}=0.25\) would lead to a background incompatibility greater than \(5\sigma\) at 1.81 (2.25) TeV, 1.94 (2.38) TeV and 2.02 (2.52) TeV assuming the same uncertainties as in Ref. [10], the scenario obtained by reducing by a factor two and by a factor four all the systematic uncertainties, respectively.

The increase of the center-of-mass energy from \(\sqrt{s}=13\) TeV to \(\sqrt{s}=14\) TeV, foreseen for the Run-3 and Run-4, will lead to an increase of the cross-sections of the dark matter signals considered in this context by 25-40%. On the other hand the overall cross-sections of the main \(V\)+jets background processes will increase by 10-15% leading to a slight increase of the \(E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}+\rm jet\) channel sensitivity.

## 7 Conclusions

The impact of different systematic uncertainty scenarios on the sensitivity of the ATLAS search for dark matter in the final state with jets and large \(E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}\) has been estimated for the target luminosities of \(300\,\mathrm{fb}^{-1}\) and \(3000\,\mathrm{fb}^{-1}\), using a simplified model in which WIMP pairs are produced from the \(s\)-channel exchange of an axial-vector mediator coupling to quarks with a coupling strength of 0.25 and to WIMPs with unit coupling strength. Since the dominant contribution to sensitivity is given by the treatment and constraining of the systematic uncertainties, the same analysis strategy and simulated samples of the search with \(36.1\,\mathrm{fb}^{-1}\) of \(pp\) collision data collected at \(\sqrt{s}=13\) TeV [10] are used, and the same center-of-mass energy is assumed. Different scenarios in terms of experimental and theoretical systematic uncertainties on signal and backgrounds have been tested, where these uncertainties are improved by a factor two or four. For WIMP masses of \(1\,\mathrm{GeV}\), the expected 95% CL limit on the mediator mass for \(300\,\mathrm{fb}^{-1}\) (\(3000\,\mathrm{fb}^{-1}\)) increases from 2.20 (2.65) TeV to 2.43 (2.88) TeV if the total uncertainties are reduced by a factor four. An improvement of the systematic uncertainties related to the theoretical modelling of the signal and background processes is found to give the leading contribution to sensitivity.

Figure 4: Expected \(3\sigma\) (solid) and \(5\sigma\) (dashed) discovery contours on the \((m_{\chi},m_{Z_{\Lambda}})\) mass plane for the axial-vector simplified model with couplings \(g_{\chi}=1\) and \(g_{q}=0.25\), for a luminosity of \(300\,\mathrm{fb}^{-1}\) (left) and \(3000\,\mathrm{fb}^{-1}\) (right). Three contours are shown in each plot, corresponding to the three different systematic uncertainty scenarios: standard (black), reduced by a factor 2 (red) and 4 (green). More details in the text.

\(5\sigma\) could be reached, for a signal with WIMP mass of 1 GeV and mediator mass of 1.81(2.25) TeV, with 300 fb\({}^{-1}\) (3000 fb\({}^{-1}\)) and can be extended up to 2.02 (2.52) TeV by reducing the systematic uncertainties by a factor four. A further sensitivity improvement in this channel is expected with the increase of the center-of-mass energy from \(\sqrt{s}=13\) TeV to \(\sqrt{s}=14\) TeV, foreseen in the future LHC phases.
