## 1 Introduction

One of the main goals of ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions is to study the properties of the deconfined matter, called Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP) produced in the hadronic collisions of two nuclei. However, since nuclei have electric charge \(Ze\) (\(e\) is the electron charge and \(Z\) is the atomic number) and are accelerated to nearly the speed of light, they generate extremely strong electromagnetic (EM) fields. These EM fields can also interact either with another nucleus or with its EM fields. Therefore, besides nuclear hadronic interactions, EM interations also occur in ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions. These EM interactions can be studied in the ultra-peripheral collisions (UPC) which occur when the distance between two nuclei in the transverse plane is larger than two times the nuclear radius, and hadronic interactions are thus suppressed [1].

The ATLAS Collaboration measured di-muons produced from two-photon interactions [2; 3] in 5.02 TeV lead-lead (Pb+Pb) collisions and established first evidence of light-by-light (LbyL) scattering [4] using a data set of 0.48 nb\({}^{-1}\) data collected in 2015. The latter allowed to put the most stringent limits to date on axion-like particle (ALP) production [5; 6] in \(\gamma\gamma\) interactions in the invariant mass range of 10-100 GeV.

This note presents studies of LbyL scattering, exclusive production of di-muon pairs and the potential of ALP searches in UPC interactions of the Pb+Pb system in the upgraded ATLAS detector with an expected integrated luminosity of 10 nb\({}^{-1}\) delivered in LHC Runs 3 and 4. The projections presented in this note are derived for Pb+Pb collisions with \(\sqrt{s_{{}_{\mathrm{NN}}}}\) =5.02 TeV and 10 nb\({}^{-1}\). The results presented here are not strongly sensitive to the slightly higher energy value, if these collisions are delivered at \(\sqrt{s_{{}_{\mathrm{NN}}}}\) = 5.52 TeV.

## 2 ATLAS Detector

The ATLAS detector is described in detail in Ref. [7]. Significant upgrades to the detector are expected to be performed for Run 4. In particular a new all-silicon tracking detector, the Inner Tracker (ITk) [8], will be installed for the high-luminosity LHC (HL-LHC) data taking. It is designed to cope with the very high pile-up rates, radiation doses, occupancies, and data transmission rates at the HL-LHC. The amount of inactive material will be significantly reduced in comparison to the current Inner Detector. This will lead to a smaller probability of photon conversions to electron-positron pairs. In the ITk the probability for a photon in the central barrel region \(|\eta|<1.0\) (barrel-endcap transition region \(1.52<|\eta|<2.37\)) to convert within a radius of 1.2 m from the interaction point is expected to be approximately 22% (38%) [8]. In comparison, in the current Inner Detector as many as 60% of the photons convert into an electron-positron pair before reaching the face of the calorimeter [7].

The ITk detector will cover eight units in pseudorapidity, \(|\eta|<4\), thus significantly extending the geometric tracking acceptance of the ATLAS detector beyond that available in the LHC Runs 1-3 (\(|\eta|<2.5\)). This increased acceptance of the ITk will be beneficial for the measurement of charged particles produced in heavy-ion collisions. The design and sensor layout of the ITk detector is described in Refs. [9] and [10]. Tracking performance expectations for the ITk in 14 TeV \(pp\) collisions are detailed in Ref. [8], and those for 5.02 TeV Pb+Pb collisions are discussed in Ref. [11].

## 3 Simulated Samples

Several simulated samples are used for the studies in this note. The LbyL signal, \(\gamma\gamma\to\gamma\gamma\), and backgrounds originating from central exclusive production (CEP) of photon pairs, \(gg\to\gamma\gamma\), are generated using SuperChic 2.06 [12; 13], while STARLight 2.0 [14] is used for exclusive production of di-lepton pairs, \(\gamma\gamma\to\ell\ell\) with \(\ell=e,\mu\), and the ALP signal, \(\gamma\gamma\to\mathrm{a}\to\gamma\gamma\). In both generators, the maximum energy for coherent photons emitted from a relativistic nucleus is approximately \(\gamma\hbar c/R\), where \(\gamma\) is the Lorentz factor of the nucleus and \(R\) is the nuclear radius. This is about 75 GeV in the 5.02 TeV Pb+Pb system (\(\gamma=2705\)). For the ALP studies, several axion mass slices are generated in the region \(5\leavevmode\nobreak\ \mathrm{GeV}<m_{\mathrm{a}}<150\leavevmode\nobreak\ \mathrm{GeV}\).

The generated samples are passed through a full simulation of the ATLAS detector using GEANT4 [15; 16], and the simulated events are reconstructed using the same algorithms as used for \(pp\) performance studies with a minimum track \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) requirement of 300 MeV as described in Ref. [8]. In this study the "Inclined duals" geometry layout of the ITk is used, as described in Ref. [9]. Trigger simulation is not available in the samples utilised for this note.

In this note two types of results are discussed. Projections based on generator-level information are denoted hereafter as truth-level information, and studies based on the full ATLAS simulation are referred to as reconstructed-level results.

## 4 Exclusive Di-Muon Production

The exclusive production of di-muon pairs, \(\gamma\gamma\to\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\), was measured by ATLAS for invariant masses of the di-muon system between 10-100 GeV [2]. Given the substantially increased statistics, the measurement will be precision-like in the LHC Runs 3 and 4, thus it is supposed to provide a calibration of the initial photon flux and can be used to constrain predictions for the other processes covered in this note. The cross section at high pair mass is also sensitive to the nuclear geometry assumed in the calculations.

Both trigger and reconstruction efficiencies can be determined using data-driven techniques on the same dataset, which will lead to reduced systematic uncertainties given the expected statistics. In this note, the \(\gamma\gamma\to\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\) process is calculated using truth-level quantities, as kinematic bin migration effects have been found to be small.

Figure 1 presents a differential cross section as a function of the invariant mass of the di-muon system in the range of 10-200 GeV with expected statistical uncertainties represented by two bands corresponding to integrated luminosities of 0.5 nb\({}^{-1}\) and 10 nb\({}^{-1}\). Two scenarios are considered for the nuclear geometry: a realistic skin depth of the nucleus or a hard sphere [17]. For the 10 nb\({}^{-1}\) scenario, a significant reduction of the statistical uncertainty is expected for the highest \(m_{\mu\mu}\) bin which spans 100-200 GeV. This will help in reducing uncertainties from the modeling of the nuclear charge distributions. The expected upgrades of the Zero Degree Calorimeters (ZDC) in the LHC Run 3 will also be important for isolating the contributions from dissociation.

## 5 Light-by-Light Scattering

The LbyL process is first studied using the truth-level quantities associated with signal photons provided in the simulated signal sample. Figure 2 presents a differential cross section as a function of the di-photon rapidity for LbyL scattering for photons with \(p_{\rm T}^{\gamma}>2.5\) GeV or \(p_{\rm T}^{\gamma}>2.0\) GeV, and \(|\eta^{\gamma}|<4\). LbyL scattering occurs in the central region: 91% of the integrated cross section is within \(|\eta^{\gamma}|<2.37\). A strong dependence on the \(p_{\rm T}^{\gamma}\) is however observed. The cross section increases by a factor of two when the single photon \(p_{\rm T}^{\gamma}\) threshold is lowered by half a GeV from 2.5 to 2.0 GeV. The corresponding integrated cross sections in the fiducial region are 112 nb for \(p_{\rm T}^{\gamma}>2.5\) GeV and 221 nb for \(p_{\rm T}^{\gamma}>2.0\) GeV.

At the reconstructed-level, LbyL event candidates are selected using the requirements which were optimised for the LbyL analysis performed in 5.02 TeV Pb+Pb collisions by ATLAS [4], which are as follows:

* Two photon candidates passing loose identification criteria with \(p_{\rm T}^{\gamma}>2.5\) GeV and \(|\eta^{\gamma}|<2.37\),
* Di-photon invariant mass (\(m_{\gamma\gamma}\)) greater than 5 GeV,

Two scenarios are considered for the nuclear geometry: a realistic skin depth of the nucleus (solid line) or a hard sphere (dashed line). (Bottom) Ratio to nominal as a function of the di-muon mass, where ”nominal” stands for the realistic skin depth of the nucleus. Shaded bands represent expected statistical uncertainties for integrated luminosity of 0.5 nb\({}^{-1}\) (yellow), and 10 nb\({}^{-1}\) (cyan).

* A veto on the presence of any charged-particle track with \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>300\) MeV, \(|\eta|<4.0\) and having at least one hit in the pixel detector,
* Transverse momentum of the di-photon system (\(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\gamma\gamma}\)) below 2 GeV,
* Acoplanarity (\(=|1-\frac{\Delta\phi}{\pi}|\)) smaller than 0.01, where \(\Delta\phi\) is a difference in the azimuthal angle between two photons.

The track-veto requirement exploits the full acceptance of the ITk detector. Due to lack of the trigger information in the simulated samples, no trigger selection is imposed at the reconstructed-level. However, with the upgraded Run-3 trigger system [18], capabilities should be in place to allow triggering on low-\(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) di-photon events with high efficiency.

Figure 3 shows acoplanarity and invariant mass distributions for the di-photon system from LbyL signal and two background components originating from exclusive production of di-electron pairs and di-photons produced in CEP reaction. The analysis is sensitive to a very particular subset of di-electron events where both electrons are mis-identified as photons in the ATLAS detector. In particular the acoplanarity distribution was proven to be powerful in discriminating between signal and background processes in the previous LbyL studies [4]. In the left panel of Figure 3 the acoplanarity distribution is shown.

About 640 LbyL events pass the selection requirements for acoplanarity below 0.01 in 5.02 TeV Pb+Pb collisions with an integrated luminosity of 10 nb\({}^{-1}\), in comparison to 13 events observed in the 2015 data analysis. The signal events are peaked at acoplanarities close to zero, while the background processes are distributed either uniformly (di-photons from CEP) or even grow with acoplanarity (\(e^{+}e^{-}\) pairs from exclusive di-electron production). The rise of the number of di-electron pairs with acoplanarity, which was not seen in the 2015 LbyL analysis, is driven by the lower \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\gamma}\) threshold of 2.5 GeV and the higher track

## 6 Searching for Axion-like Particles

Axions and ALP are fundamental components of extensions of the Standard Model, occurring in most solutions of the strong CP problem [19; 20]. In addition, ALP with masses below the MeV scale could have a wide range of implications for cosmology and astrophysics. In particular, they are good candidates for cold dark matter [21], which could affect the thermal evolution of the universe, the Cosmic Microwave Background [22] or lead to astrophysical anomalies, such as the observed transparency of the universe to very high energy \(\gamma\)-rays [23].

Recently an increasing interest has also been paid to ALP masses above 1 GeV [24]. In this mass range, ALP are largely irrelevant for cosmology but they can have a number of implications for general physics. Indeed, the Higgs discovery has set spin zero particles in the spotlight of searches for new physics, with scalar and pseudo-scalar particles (elementary or not) as heralds of new phenomena. An interesting feature is that ALP (generically labeled as \(a\) in the following) in this mass range would induce an anomalous contribution to the LbyL, via the reaction: \(\gamma\gamma\to a\to\gamma\gamma\), under the condition that the magnitudes of the EM fields associated with the incident photon are large enough, typically \(\left|\vec{E}\right|>10^{18}\) V/m. This has triggered the study presented in Ref. [5], and then in Ref. [6] using the recent observation of LbyL scattering published by the ATLAS experiment in Pb+Pb collisions [4], where the electric field produced by the ultra-relativistic Pb is of the order of \(10^{25}\) V/m (thus satisfying the above condition). Then, the photon-ALP interaction can be described by a Lagrangian density of the form [24]:

\[\mathcal{L}_{\alpha\gamma\gamma}=\frac{1}{4\Lambda}aF^{\mu\nu}\vec{F}_{\mu\nu }=\frac{1}{\Lambda}a\mathbf{E}\cdot\mathbf{B},\]

where \(a\) is the massive scalar ALP field (of mass \(m_{\rm a}\)) and \(1/\Lambda\) is the coupling of the interaction (the dimension of \(\Lambda\) is energy). This means in particular that the equation of motion of the field \(a\) reads:

Figure 3: Reco-level acoplanarity (left) and invariant mass (right) distributions of the di-photon system for photons from the LbyL signal and background processes in 5.02 TeV Pb+Pb collisions with an integrated luminosity of 10 nb\({}^{-1}\). The shaded band in cyan represents expected statistical uncertainties.

\((\partial_{\mu}\partial^{\mu}+m^{2})a=-\frac{1}{\Lambda}\,\,\mathbf{E}\cdot \mathbf{B}\). This is the physical link between \(a\) and the EM fields. Let us note that the EM fields themselves satisfy the Maxwell equations modified by the presence of the ALP field. In the high energy limit, for the narrow-width approximation, one can suppose that \(\sigma_{\gamma\gamma\to a\to\gamma\gamma}\) is non-zero only when the invariant mass of the two photons is equal to \(m_{\mathrm{a}}\pm\Gamma\), where \(\Gamma\) is the decay width of the ALP. The cross section can be shown to have the form [24]:

\[\sigma_{\gamma\gamma\to a\to\gamma\gamma}\propto\frac{1}{\Lambda^{2}} \mathcal{B}_{a\to\gamma\gamma},\]

where \(\mathcal{B}_{a\to\gamma\gamma}\) is the branching ratio of the ALP into photons. Thus, one can write: \(\mathcal{B}_{a\to\gamma\gamma}=\Gamma(a\to\gamma\gamma)/\Gamma\), where \(\Gamma(a\to\gamma\gamma)\) is the minimal decay width of the ALP into photons given by \(\Gamma=m_{\mathrm{a}}^{3}/(64\pi\Lambda^{2})\). In the extraction of the limit for the coupling in \(1/\Lambda\) as a function of \(m_{\mathrm{a}}\), the convention used in the previous collider searches is followed. It assumes that \(\mathcal{B}_{a\to\gamma\gamma}=1\)[5, 24]. If this assumption is removed, the corresponding exclusion regions would correspond to smaller ranges of \(1/\Lambda\). One would get a lower signal rate as the total decay width would increase for decreasing \(\mathcal{B}_{a\to\gamma\gamma}\) (as \(\Gamma(a\to\gamma\gamma)\) is fixed). Therefore, the region of the ALP (bump) search shrinks with \(\mathcal{B}_{a\to\gamma\gamma}\) and the exclusion region is less optimal.

The potential of ALP searches in UPC Pb+Pb collisions is studied using reconstructed-level quantities with the selection requirements described in Section 5. In addition to these selection criteria, and in order to increase the sensitivity to the ALP signal, a requirement of \(p_{\Upsilon}^{\gamma}/m_{\gamma\gamma}>0.35\) is applied. The overall selection efficiency (times acceptance) relative to generated event increases from about 40% to 65% for ALP masses ranging from 7 GeV to 80 GeV. Also, the mass resolution varies from 0.5 GeV at low masses (below 15 GeV) up to 1 GeV for larger masses. The invariant mass distribution is used as the discriminating variable, with bin widths comparable to the expected resolution of a narrow resonant signal. A binned likelihood function is constructed in each bin of the \(m_{\gamma\gamma}\) distribution from the Poisson probability of the sum of the contributions of the background and of a hypothetical signal of strength relative to the benchmark model. This likelihood function is used to set limits on the presence of a signal. A systematic uncertainty of 25% is considered for the shape of the LbyL background distribution as well as a systematic uncertainty of 20% on the normalisation of the total cross section for this background. Also, the uncertainty on the integrated luminosity is taken to be 6%. Uncertainties related to the knowledge of initial photon fluxes, potentially affecting the ALP signal acceptance and efficiency, are not included in this analysis. These normalisation uncertainties could be further constrained depending on results of the measurements presented in Sections 4 and 5. The systematic uncertainties enter as nuisance parameters with Gaussian or log-normal prior distributions, in convolution with the nominal background distribution.

In Figure 4 the expected mass distributions for three ALP signal mass values, and the main background from LbyL are shown. In this study, other sources of backgrounds are neglected, since they have been found to be small in the LbyL measurement [4].

Upper limits are set on the product of the production cross section of new resonances and their decay branching ratio into \(\gamma\gamma\). Exclusion intervals are derived using the CLs method [25] in the asymptotic approximation. The limit set on the signal strength \(\mu\) is then translated into a limit on the signal cross section times branching ratio and the coupling, as presented in Figure 5. The branching ratio is taken to be 1 (see above). These limits are found to be compatible with the expected limits estimated in Ref. [5].

In Figure 6 the exclusion limit extracted above along with the existing exclusion limits from the compilation presented in Ref. [26] are presented. Sensitivity of this analysis covers the range in ALP masses between 7 GeV and 140 GeV, where the previous analysis [5] is also shown (labeled as ATLAS 2016 in the figure).

## 7 Conclusion

Several processes involving \(\gamma\gamma\) interactions in ultra-peripheral collisions of lead nuclei at 5.02 TeV are studied using the simulation of future upgrade of the ATLAS detector. The expected integrated luminosity of 10 nb\({}^{-1}\) leads to improvements in precision for measurements which suffer from lack of statistics in 2015 lead-lead collisions (e.g. light-by-light scattering). Also a potential of observing axion-like particles is discussed with axion masses covering the region of 7-140 GeV. Expected limits on the axion production cross section and coupling are provided.
