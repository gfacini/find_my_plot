###### Abstract

We describe the results of the program to radiation qualify the SCA controller preselection for the ATLAS LAr calorimeter front-end boards. Based on the radiation test results, we consider the SCA controller radiation qualified for preselection.

## 1 Introduction

The front-end board of the ATLAS LAr calorimeter readout uses switched capacitor array (SCA) analog memories for storage of the calorimeter signals during the level-1 trigger latency. The addressing of the SCAs and other control functions of the front-end board are managed by two SCA controller (SCAC) ASICs on each front-end board.

The SCA controller has been implemented in a 0.25 \(\mu\)m CMOS process using a radiation-tolerant standard-cell library [1]. The SCA controller was submitted for prototyping on 28 February 2001 (MPW4 run). Bare die were received in July 2001. A second prototype, mainly required to add ESD protection to the I/O buffers, was submitted November 2001 (MPW6 run). Packaged parts were received 5 April 2002.

The front-end boards will be located on-detector, in crates mounted on the feedthroughs in the gap between the barrel and the endcap cryostats (for the EM barrel) and at the back of the endcap cryostats (for the EM endcap and hadronic endcap). The SCA controller must therefore undergo a radiation qualification procedure to ensure its suitability for use in the ATLAS environment.

## 2 Radiation Tolerance Requirements

The SCA controllers are located in the upper region of the front-end board. Although the die of an SCA controller is only 16 mm\({}^{2}\), for safety we consider the radiation levels in a 200 cm\({}^{2}\) area bounded by 300 cm \(<Z<\) 320 cm and 330 cm \(<R<\) 340 cm. The worst case simulated radiation levels (SRL) in this region are listed in table 1 for 10 years of LHC operation for the cases of total ionizing dose (TID), non-ionizing energy loss (NIEL), and single event effects (SEE). The corresponding radiation levels for the endcap crates are approximately ten times smaller than in the barrel.

The ATLAS Policy for Radiation Tolerant Electronics [2] assigns safety factors (SF) which are to be applied in the radiation qualification process. The safety factors account forthe uncertainties in the simulated radiation levels (SIM), in possible low dose rate effects (LDR), and for possible lot-to-lot variations (LOT). Table 1 includes the safety factors we have used. In choosing these safety factors, we have considered the SCA controller to be a radiation-hard ASIC designed in a radiation-qualified deep-submicron CMOS process using a radiation-tolerant layout technique. The final production of the SCA controller would involve the delivery of a homogeneous batch of 48 wafers. We therefore use values for LOT appropriate to the preselection of radiation-hard ASICs to be produced in series from a known batch. For the TID tests, we take the LDR safety factor of 1.5 since we do not perform post-irradiation aging at an elevated temperature in all the tests. The final radiation tolerance criteria (RTC) are calculated as the simulated radiation levels multiplied by the product of the three safety factors:

* RTC\({}_{\text{TID}}\) = 414 Gy,
* RTC\({}_{\text{NIEL}}\) = \(1.34\times 10^{13}\) neutron/cm\({}^{2}\) (1-MeV equivalent damage in Si), and
* RTC\({}_{\text{SEE}}\) = \(2.87\times 10^{12}\) hadron/cm\({}^{2}\) (hadrons with energy greater than 20 MeV).

## 3 Radiation Facilities

To obtain the TID levels we have used an x-ray facility and a proton irradiation facility. To obtain the NIEL and SEE levels we have used a proton irradiation facility.

### X-Ray Radiation Facility

We have commissioned an x-ray generator in Alberta for ATLAS TID studies. The machine operates at a constant electron accelerating potential of 320 kVp and a tube current of 10 mA. The machine is capable of exposure rates up to about 30 R/s.

We estimated the absorbed dose in the SiO\({}_{2}\) of the devices by measuring the exposure in air using an ion chamber and current digitizer. The ion chamber was calibrated using a medical facility to measure the absolute exposure in air to an accuracy of about 1%. The exposure in air was measured beneath the device and measured again with the device removed. The exposures with and without the device in place were extrapolated to the position of the die of the device. The difference in these two exposure measurements was about 19%. The exposures were converted to dose in air using a value of 8.76 mGy/R.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c c c|c|} \hline Radiation & SRL & \multicolumn{3}{c|}{SF} & RTC \\ \cline{2-5} Effect & (10 yr) & SIM & LDR & LOT & (10 yr) \\ \hline TID & 39.4 Gy & 3.5 & 1.5 & 2 & 414 Gy \\ NIEL & \(1.34\times 10^{12}\) n/cm\({}^{2}\) & 5 & 1 & 2 & 1.34 \(\times\) 10\({}^{13}\) n/cm\({}^{2}\) \\ SEE & \(2.87\times 10^{11}\) h/cm\({}^{2}\) & 5 & 1 & 2 & 2.87 \(\times\) 10\({}^{12}\) h/cm\({}^{2}\) \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 1: Simulated radiation levels (SRL), safety factors (SF), and radiation tolerance criterion (RTC) applicable to the SCA controller.

The dose in air was converted to an absorbed dose in SiO\({}_{2}\) by using energy attenuation coefficients and an estimate of the energy spectrum of the x-rays.

The absorbed dose at the die of the devices were taken as the mean of the doses calculated with and without the device in place. All uncertainties were estimated at the one standard deviation level, added in quadrature, and propagated through to the final absorbed dose values. Using the above procedure, the dose rate for the tests was \((21\pm 3)\) cGy(SiO\({}_{2}\))/s.

### Proton Radiation Facility

The Proton Irradiation Facility at the TRIUMF cyclotron in Vancouver [3] was used to irradiate the parts. We used the lower-energy beam line to obtain a range of energies between 20 MeV and 105 MeV. This range of energies was obtained by extracting a primary beam of energy 70 MeV or 116 MeV, and lowering it to the desired energy with a rotary-wedge degrader. The energy resolution of the beam varied between 0.7% at the highest energy to 9% at the lowest energy. We also used the high-energy beam line to obtain an energy of 491 MeV from a primary beam energy of 493 MeV. The energy resolution of this beam was about 1 MeV.

At the low-energy beam line, the primary beam was passed through a 2.4 mm lead scatterer inside a 12 mm diameter collimator. A second collimator of diameter 28.6 mm was placed 32 cm away from the lead scatterer. The device was mounted on a plate near the end of the second collimator so that we could obtain proton beam fluxes between \(3.0\times 10^{8}\) cm\({}^{-2}\)s\({}^{-1}\) and \(1.2\times 10^{9}\) cm\({}^{-2}\)s\({}^{-1}\). The non-uniformity of the beam was measured to be approximately 3% over a 5 mm diameter circle centered on the die of the device.

At the high-energy beam line, the primary beam was passed through a 1.3 mm thick lead scatterer which was placed 1.3 m upstream of the test location. The device was mounted in a fixture that allowed the beam to impinge on the device at different angles. The proton flux was between \(5.7\times 10^{8}\) cm\({}^{-2}\)s\({}^{-1}\) and \(7.3\times 10^{8}\) cm\({}^{-2}\)s\({}^{-1}\). The non-uniformity of the beam on the die of the device was calculated to be about 5%.

The proton intensity was measured with an ionization chamber, which was calibrated for water equivalent dose at the position of the device. The corresponding proton fluence was calculated using energy-loss tables from ICRU-49 and SRIM. A scintillator telescope was also used to calibrate the ion chamber at lower proton fluxes. For a primary beam energy of 120 MeV, the agreement between the ionization chamber and scintillator was about 7%, while for a primary beam energy of 60 MeV, the agreement was between 11% at the lowest energy to 1.5% at the highest energy. The ion chamber agreed with a Faraday cup to better than 1% for 200 MeV protons from the high-energy beam line.

## 4 Radiation Test Setup

The test setup consisted of two printed circuit boards, a multimeter, and two computers. Since the SCA controller logic operates at 40 MHz, real-time communication with the SCA controller can not be performed with a computer. The real-time control of the SCA controller is driven by an FPGA mounted on a "monitor" board. The FPGA monitor board was connected to the device under test (DUT) board by two 40-pin cables, long enough to allow the FPGA to be sufficiently shielded from the radiation. All I/O pins of the SCA controller were connected in this way to the FPGA, which could therefore monitor all SCA controller activity in real time. A DAQ computer acted as the master and initiated all communication with the monitor FPGA. The monitor board also contained voltage regulators for providing power to the device under test. The power supply current to the device under test was measured with a multimeter, which was read out by a second computer.

## 5 Radiation Test Results

Each part was functionally tested before and after irradiation using the procedure described in references [4] and [5]. The real-time monitoring of the SCA controller included both the measurement of its current and complete functional monitoring of its operation. We irradiated 12 parts at the Proton Irradiation Facility and 10 parts with x-rays. The results presented here use parts from the MPW6 run, but we also refer to radiation test results from the MPW4 run [6].

Using a proton beam allows us to simultaneously accumulate TID, NIEL that can be converted to 1-MeV equivalent neutron fluence, and hadrons with sufficient energy to cause SEE. The conversion factors to dose and neutron fluence are energy-dependent.

No occurrences of latch-up were observed, and it was not necessary during any of the tests to cycle the power to the SCA controller.

### TID Test Results

The current drawn by each part was monitored during both the x-ray and proton irradiations. As the integrated dose increased, the current exhibited a slight decrease. A plot of the change in current versus absorbed dose for each part is shown in figure 1. Table 2 summarizes the results of the TID testing. In addition to the 22 MPW6 parts that have been tested, four MPW4 parts were irradiated with protons to 45, 41, 46, and 99 kGy [6]. In no case was there a functional interupt or upset during the x-ray irradiations. No post-irradiation effects due to high temperature or room temperature annealing were observed. Two parts were prestressed by elevated temperature burn-in before irradiatition. Again, no effect was observed.

Further investigations of the change in current after irradiation and with temperature indicate that some of the drop in current (about 0.4 mA) during irradiation can be attributed to thermal heating of the device. We attribute the remaining decrease in current due to the nature of DSM CMOS devices: the positive trapped charges in the gate and lateral oxide of the PMOS transistors move the threshold voltage towards more negative values, and thus slightly reduce the sub-threshold component of the leakage current. This effect is normally masked by the increase in NMOS leakage currents, but since enclosed transistors have been implemented in this design, the NMOS leakage currents have been eliminated. The small decrease in current will be negligible during ATLAS operation.

### NIEL Test Results

Table 3 shows the NIEL of protons in silicon, the relative displacement damage (\(K_{\mathrm{p}}/K_{\mathrm{n}}\)), the proton fluence, and the equivalent 1-MeV neutron fluence receive by each part. The silicon neutron displacement kerna factor at 1 MeV, \(K_{\mathrm{n}}\), was taken to be 95 MeV-mb, which corresponds to a damage factor of 2.033 MeV-cm\({}^{2}\)/g. In addition to the 12 MPW6 parts that have been tested, four MPW4 parts [6] were irradiated with protons to a higher damage factor than the RT\({}_{\mathrm{NIEL}}\).

### SEE Test Results

Table 4 summaries the results of the proton SEE tests. The proton energies and fluences are shown. Also shown in table 4 are the observed upsets. Analysis of the upsets is complicated by the considerable circuit-mitigation techniques that are employed in the SCA controller. The SCA controller makes extensive use of Hamming codes for the SRAM, and triple redundancy and majority logic for the registers. The FIFO memories within the SCA controller are made with SRAM which are protected by error detection and correction (EDAC) units at three different locations. It is thus possible to correct all single-bit upsets and detect all multiple-bit upsets within the FIFOs. Occurrences of these upsets will set bits in a status register which is read out once per trigger. The flipped bit is corrected and has no effect on the operation of the SCA controller. We denote the single-bit upsets as "SRAM upsets". We denote the multiple-bit upsets as "MBIT upsets". In addition to the Hamming codes, a few important bits in the FIFOs are provided with redundent copies, which are protected

with triple redundancy and majority logic. Upsets of these bits are denoted as "LFIFO upsets".

The path of the capacitor addresses within the SCA controller is completely protected by the above mechanisms. However, there are a few occurrences where the data is unprotected as it is transmitted off the chip. The bunch-crossing identifier and event counters are not protected. When the data packets for the gain selector are serially shifted out, these serial shift registers are also not protected. We denote the bunch-crossing identifier counter and event counter upsets as "BCID and EVT upsets", respectively. Upsets from the shift registers to the gain selector are denoted as "SHIFT upsets".

### Impact of SEE on ATLAS Operation

The upsets can be divided into two classes. The single-bit SRAM upsets which are corrected on-the-fly (SRAM and LFIFO upsets) and the non-correctable upsets (MBIT, BCID, EVT, SHFT upsets). The single-bit SRAM upsets do not effect the data, while the other upsets effect the data to different degrees. Figure 2 shows the total upset cross-section and cross-section for the upsets that could not be corrected by the SCA controller logic. The total upset cross-section is dominated by the single-bit upsets occurring in the SRAM. Included in the plot are both our MPW6 data and the MPW4 data at proton energies of 22, 50, and 158 MeV [6].

It appears that there may be small normalization differences between the data sets from the Harvard cyclotron (MPW4) and the two TRIUMF cyclotron beam lines. We found it difficult to fit the cross-section versus energy to either the standard Weibull or log-normal cumulative distribution functions. To avoid the large region between 158 MeV and 491 MeV with no data, we dropped the 491 MeV data from our fits. The remaining data shown in figure 3 has been fit to a log-normal cumulative density function and the results of the fits are shown in table 5. These fits give directly the cross-section at infinite energy (saturation cross-section), \(\sigma_{\rm sat}\), and the energy at which the saturation cross-section drops by 50% (threshold energy), \(E_{\rm th}\). \(W\) is a shape parameter. Although there may be a small normalization difference between the MPW4 and MPW6 data, the results of the fit to the combined data set are consistent with the results from the MPW6 data only. To

obtain meaningful statistics we combine the data form the MPW4 and MPW6 runs in the following calculations.

We have convoluted the fitted upset distributions in figure 3 with the simulated energy spectra for protons, pions, and neutrons, shown in figure 4. This calculation results in the upset rates in ATLAS shown in the second column of table 6 and the mean time between upsets (MTBU) shown in the third column. These upset rates can be scaled to the entire EM barrel system by taking into account the fact that a total of 1792 SCA controllers are required to instrument the EM barrel (896 front-end boards, with 2 SCA controllers per board). Scaling by 1792 gives the fourth column of data in table 6. The upper half of table 6

Table 5: Results of fits to the upset cross-section data using a log-normal cumulative density function.

includes all the upset, most of which are correctable, while the lower half of the table 6 shows the corresponding rates for upsets that are not correctable by the SCA controller.

The real upsets that cause errors in the data are the MBIT, BCID, EVT, and SHFT upsets. In no case can these upsets prevent the SCA controller from operating. Detection of the BCID, EVT, and SHFT types of upsets rely on the fact that each 128-channel front-end board will be equipped with two SCA controller ASICs, each which will operate 64 channels. Data from the two sets of 64 channels including the addresses supplied by each SCA controller as well as various SCA controller status bits, are combined and transmitted over a single optical link to the readout driver (ROD). Monitoring and detection of the upsets in SCA controller operation will be done in the ROD by comparing the addresses from the two SCA controller ASICs, which should be identical. If a mismatch is detected, the front-end board in question must be re-initialized before its data can be considered valid.

The BCID and EVT numbers are inserted in the front-end board output dataflow to allow identification and alignment of the complete events. Corruption of these counters would currupt the data for a single event only, assuming appropriate re-alignment schemes are implemented in the ROD. In this case, no front-end board reset would be required.

It should be noted that some of the BCID, EVT, and SHFT upsets that we observe may actually be electrical glitches in the monitor system. Any glitch on the I/O gate or transmission over the 3 m long cable between the SCA controller and the monitor FPGA will appear as an upset.

The most serious type of upset is the multiple-bit upset, since these cannot be automatically corrected in the SCA controller logic and require that the front-end board with the

affected SCA controller be issued a reset in order to initialize and resynchronize the two SCA controller ASICs.

The data at 491 MeV that has been neglected should have very little effect on the above calculations. The hadron flux at the location of the SCA controllers falls off by at least four orders of magnitude at 500 MeV. It is however interesting to note that the measured total and non-correctable upset cross-sections at 491 MeV are about twice and four times greater, respectively, than predicted by the fits.

### Angular Dependence of the Upsets

The particle fluxes at the location of the SCA controllers are expected to be homogenous in direction. Most SEE testing is performed with the beam impinging on the device at right angles to the largest surface of the die (\(\theta=0^{\circ}\)). There is some evidence that for devices that have a high critical charge and one small dimension, that there is an angular dependence in the proton-induced SEU cross-section.

We irradiated devices at five different angles with protons of 491 MeV. A high energy was chosen so that the effects of packaging and the printed circuit board could be neglected. The upset cross-section relative to the upset cross-section at \(\theta=0^{\circ}\) is shown in figure 5. The statistics for the non-correctable upsets are not high enough to make any statement beside that the cross-section is consistent with having no angular dependence. The angular dependence of the total upset cross-section is also consistent with being flat, although the data favours a 25% increase at 90\({}^{\circ}\) (irradiated through the side of the device) and a 31% increase at 180\({}^{\circ}\) (irradiated through the back of the device).

Summary of Radiation Test Results

More than 10 parts have been irradiated beyond the radiation tolerance criteria for TID. Since no upsets or significant parameter variations have been observed, we consider the SCA controller qualified for TID radiation.

There has been no observation of displacement damage in any of the parts. 8, 2, 1, and 1 parts have been irradiated to approximately 1/3, 1/2, 3/4, and greater than the radiation tolerance criteria for NEL, respectively. From the MPW4 run, four parts were irradiated beyond the radiation tolerance criteria for NIEL. In any case, it is not necessary to test for NIEL damage for pure CMOS devices, which are naturally tolerant to displacement damage [2]. Although the SCA controller uses bipolar diodes for the ESD protection, these diodes have been shown to be immune to displacement damage.

12 parts have been irradiated with protons above 20 MeV and the soft upset cross-section measured. In no case was a hard upset observed. An analysis of the impact of the soft upsets in ATLAS has been performed. We estimate that a correctable upset will occur in the SCA controllers in ATLAS about every two minutes; making them a nice dosimeter. On the other hand, a non-correctable upset will occur in ATLAS only about every hour. This demonstrates the effectiveness of the mitigation techniques that have been employed. The upset rates are considered not to impose a significant problem with the operation of ATLAS. We consider the SCA controller qualified for SEE.

Based on the radiation test results presented here and in reference [6], we consider the SCA controller radiation qualified for preselection.
