Introduction

The ATLAS detector will work at very high luminosity and consequently at very high radiation levels in all detector components and in the area. A further consequence is a high level of induced radioactivity in the most exposed components. In the ATLAS TP [1], in the Muon [2], Inner Detector [3], Calorimeter [4] TDR's, as well as in other notes [5], a considerable amount of description and thought about the radiation has been collected.

There is now the need to study the problem to the level of obtaining a "TDR-like" design of the measures required to minimise the radiation effects. To this purpose, the RADIATION and SHIELDING Working Group has been set up in July 1997. This note summarizes part of the studies and discussions performed inside this group 2 obtained up to now. Main contributors for the part described in this note have been A. Ferrari, M. Cobal, G. Benincasa and A. Uzunian.

Footnote 2: The results concerning the MARS Monte Carlo [6] and the study done in the collimator region [7] can be found elsewhere.

More detailed information can be found in the WEB page at the address:

[http://atlasinfo.cern.ch/Atlas/TCOORD/TechCoord/technical/radiation/index.html](http://atlasinfo.cern.ch/Atlas/TCOORD/TechCoord/technical/radiation/index.html).

As a first step, the following list of actions has been prepared.

1. Establish in ATLAS a reference file of the ATLAS geometry and the subsequent radiation levels using FLUKA [8]. The corresponding geometry will have to be spelled out and compared with the most recent general layout drawings. Inconsistencies will be corrected to set the baseline.
2. The MARS program [9] should be used on that geometry and the results should be compared. The following actions should be done with the MARS program and some of the geometries checked with FLUKA.
3. Different geometries, materials and thicknesses of the beam pipe as well as the influence of flanges, pumps, getters, etc. has to be introduced and calculated.
4. Model in all detail the shielding disc in the end-cap LAr calorimeters.
5. Model the shielding disc, the plug and the CSC support between end-cap and LAr and ECT.
6. Detail the shielding in the ECTs including coils, etc. Add material where possible between coils and in the vicinity of the inner shielding cylinder.
7. Study the gap/crack region: Introduce tile plugs, services and crates as material, study the fingers, optimise.
8. Study the collimator region: Increase the copper cylinder of the collimator by a factor of two in radius; replace the copper cylinder by tungsten or a heavy metal, try to pack more interaction lengths into the given radius; increase the shield radius locally.
9. Decide on new baseline shielding configuration and on vacuum chamber layout in the downstream shielding region.

## 2 FLUKA: reference geometry file

The current geometry layout used for the inner cavity and calorimeters, up to the first muon chambers, implemented in the FLUKA Monte Carlo, is named TP37. A sketch of the TP37 geometry is given in figure 1. The picture above shows the ATLAS detector with particular attention to the shielding elements; the one below shows the ATLAS hall, again with the indication of the shielding elements.

The main differences with the TP32 version, which is the one used for the radiation study presented in the Muon system TDR [2] are the following:

1. the gap between the barrel and extended barrel calorimeters;
2. a reduction of the space available in the plug below the 1st forward station because of the CSC support needs and of chamber assembly procedures;
3. an increase in the empty volumes of the forward toroids which allowed an easier streaming of particles into the hall.

All these differences where such that, with the TP37 scheme the radiation level is about a factor of two higher than with the TP32 geometry. The results for the TP32 and the TP37 configurations are summarized in the tables from 1 to 15, at the end of this report. They give the background fluence rate (for neutral particles) and the current rate (for muons, charged hadrons and electron/positrons) in \(\rm{KHz/cm^{2}}\) for the three barrel and forward muon chamber superlayers, for different \(z\) and \(\eta\) regions (see captions) 3. Aim of the radiation studies is now to go back to the TP32 radiation level.

Footnote 3: In order to correctly interprete the numbers reported in the tables, note that a statistical error on the fluences of less than 10% make the prediction reliable. An error of around 20% makes the measurement reliable inside one order of magnitude, while an error greater than 30% it is such as to compromise the measurement reliability.

## 3 FLUKA at CERN

Recently the FLUKA code has been transferred on the ATLAS UNIX machines. The code has been already tested and is installed in:

 /afs/cern.ch/atlas/project/fluka/flukapro where one can find the executable, all the libraries, the data files and the sources. The FLUKA manual (fluka.doc) is also available.

A \(readme\) file in the same area can be consulted, and two scripts allow the user to run FLUKA in online mode (\(ratlas\) ) and in batch mode (\(batlas\), in the /prod subdirectory).

Presently, the output is in binary format, and the software needed to produce the plots and tables shown in this note is not yet installed. The contact person for comments/suggestions is P. Sala.

## 4 Geometry changes implemented in FLUKA

In the following, some studies which have been performed with the FLUKA simulations, modifying the ATLAS geometry file, are reported. Each study is characterized by a specific geometry configuration, which will be named TP\(xx\).

### Different beam pipe thickness: TP38 and TP39 configurations

The beam pipe geometry included in the TP37 FLUKA geometry configuration is subdivided into different sections, with different diameters and materials, as shown in figure 2, where the region between \(763<z<1717\) cm is sketched. The beam pipe in this region is made out of stainless steel. The radius for \(z<1330\) cm is 3.50 cm. The thickness is 0.59 cm. For \(z>1330\) cm, the radius is 6.0 cm, and the thickness is: 0.12 cm. At \(z=1330\) a flange is present, together with an Aluminum getter pump (\(18<R<20\) cm). At \(z=1715\) cm a second flange is visible, as well as an iron ion pump which goes up to \(R=28\) cm. In order to evaluate the effect of a new beam pipe design on the ATLAS radiation level, three different situations have been simulated.

1. the beam pipe as in TP37
2. no beam pipe (TP38)
3. the TP37 beam pipe thickness doubled (TP39)

In figure 3 the isolevel maps for the neutron and \(\gamma\) fluence rates expected when the beam pipe material is removed are shown. The tables from 1 to 15 at the end of this report summarize the various TPxx results in the muon chambers regions. An effect can be seen, expecially in the toroid region. Doubling the pipe thickness (TP39 configuration), has a negligible effect on the charged particle fluxes. For neutrons and \(\gamma\) there is an increased flux, ranging from 10 up to 30%, depending on the examined regions (see figure 4 and tables).

### Presence of a getter pump in the beam pipe

As a test, it has been proposed to insert a 50 Kg disk of iron at a distance of 1 m from the collimator. The disk diameter should be equal to 20 cm. Purpose of this exercise was to simulate the presence of a pump. It has been checked that in the TP37 geometry, there is already a 37 Kg disk of iron at 1 m from the collimator. This disk has a diameter of about 22 cm (6.12\(<\)R\(<\)28 cm). The effect of the disk is not critical as can be seen in figure 7, which shows the neutron fluence zooming in the \(z\) region where the getter pump is located (between 1900 and 2000 cm). Already at a radial distance of 300 cm, the presence of the pump it not visible anymore.

### Effect of the hall walls: TP40 configuration

For all the simulations performed up to now with the FLUKA Monte Carlo, the ATLAS geometry file included the ATLAS hall concrete walls. To see their influence on the radiation levels, one should compare the results for the'standard' TP37 configuration and for the TP40 one, obtained by removing the walls, in tables from 1 to 15 at the end of this report. The presence of the walls determine an huge increase of the neutron and \(\gamma\) fluxes (see figure 5). Similar results have been obtained with the MARS Monte Carlo. This study suggested to explore the possibility of applying some kind of coating the concrete walls (see next section).

### Study of different material for the forward shielding: TP41 configuration

The structure of the actual muon shielding simulated in the FLUKA Monte Carlo, is shown in figure 1, which shows in the upper plot the geometry for the ATLAS detector, and in the lower plot the geometry for the ATLAS hall (TP37) with the indication of the various shieldings. In particular, one can notice the forward muon shielding. This shielding, downstream of the endcap toroids, is made of iron surrounded by two layers of Lithium loaded polyethylene (25 cm) and lead (5 cm). The Lithium polyethylene is intended to act as neutron energy moderator, and to capture the thermalized neutrons. The lead layer provides the \(\gamma\) suppression. Recently, Sirotenko and Willis [10] studied the effect of replacing this baseline forward shielding structure, with heavy concrete, this last having the same shape as the polyethylene-lead sandwich. The advantage of using the concrete is that this material is non-flammable and is a reasonable structural material. They found, using the GCALOR Monte Carlo, that with the concrete the \(\gamma\) fluence is reduced by about 20% everywhere, compared to the polyethylene-lead case. The neutron fluence is practically unchanged: of course, improvements in the \(\gamma\) fluence are most helpful, as the rate in the detector is dominated by \(\gamma\).

The same exercise was repeated with FLUKA. The heavy concrete composition (by weight) is shown in table 1. The results (see figure 6) show a very mild increase in the photon fluence and a similarly mild decrease in the neutron one. Both are not unexpected, since mixing hydrogenated material with lead makes photon attenuation a bit less effective, but it prevents a bit of build-up of neutrons in the pure lead last layer of the polyethylene-lead setup.

The conclusion is that - at the present level of background - there are no reasons (apart from technical ones) preventing the use of the heavy concrete solution. However, one should not forget that the present background is a factor of two larger than wished. Therefore, it can be that the difference between heavy concrete and polyethylene-lead will show up more with a lower background.

## 5 Geometry changes to be implemented

Part of the activity of the RADIATION and SHIELDING group was devoted to collect all the drawings documenting geometry changes in the ATLAS detector, relevant for the radiation studies. The person responsible to keep all the drawings up-to-date was G. Bachy. Drawings of the forward shielding, the end-cap cryostat and shield, the Tile calorimeter, the CSC muon system, the end-cap toroid, the hall walls and the beam pipe were collected and distributed.

### Evaluation of the muon detectors material budget

The MARS Monte Carlo showed that \(\gamma\) are locally produced in the muon chambers, and they can double the total fluence for the muon external barrel and forward layers. Therefore, it is of primary importance to simulate properly the muon chambers. Presently, in both FLUKA and MARS, the muon structure is simulated using everywhere aluminum. A verification of the true material budget has been carried on.

The MDT tubes are made out of an alloy which will be very similar to what is called Alluman 100. Its composition is reported in table 2.

Information on the support materials are not yet available. For CSCs, TGCs and RPCs, a list of the material is now available in the muon

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|} \hline

### The hall

The walls of the cavern will have a thickness of about 2 m in the services cavern separation zones, and of about 1 m in the other zones. Presently in FLUKA the hall walls are simulated as made out of concrete. In reality in these walls there will be two iron grids positionned near the two extreme layers of the concrete.

The grid has a square lattice with a 15 cm side, and the iron bars have a diameter of 3.2 cm. A quick approximate computation gives the values listed in table 3.

Here, only the innermost grid is considered; the outermost grid should not have an effect on reflected particles in the cavern. The effect of the presence of this iron should be evaluated using FLUKA.

It was suggested that, since Boron as shielding material is largerly diffused (i.e.: in concrete walls, dissolved in water etc.), one could try to use borated concrete for the ATLAS hall walls. Another possible shielding material would be Lithium. A simulation was performed with the MARS Monte Carlo, trying different concentration of Boron (Lithium) in the concrete of the walls. With 1% of Boron one gets the modest result of a 20% reduction of the neutron fluences in the more external chamber layers. With the 4% and 2% concentrations, a reduction factor between two and three is obtained for the most external chamber layers in both cases. The 4% Lithium simulation do not produce appreciable improvements with respect to the corresponding Boron percentage simulation. The best cost/performance results were obtained using a 2% concentration of Boron, as shown in table 4. This should be than the baseline for subsequent FLUKA simulations.

A market survey has been carried out in order to estimate the additional costs of using borated concrete in the walls. The geometry of the walls has been simplified as a hollow cylinder 1 m thick. The boron has been considered as uniformely distributed in all the thickness of the walls. In fact, only 30 cm of borated concrete should be sufficient for the required shielding

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|} \hline
**Material** & **Percentage** \\ \hline H & 1.0 \\ C & 0.1 \\ O & 52.4 \\ Na & 1.6 \\ Al & 3.4 \\ Si & 33.7 \\ Ca & 4.4 \\ Fe & 1.4 \\ B10 & 0.4 \\ B11 & 1.6 \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|} \hline Total volume of concrete & 5000 m\({}^{3}\) \\ Total weight of concrete & 12500 Tons \\ Total volume of one grid & 120 m\({}^{3}\) \\ Total weight of iron & 943 Tons \\ \% of iron in volume & 2.4 \\ \% of iron in weight & 1.5 \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 3: _ATLAS hall walls characteristics._effect: but, in practice, it would be certainly more expensive to build a multi-layers cavern walls. Following table 3 for the volume and weight of the concrete, and assuming a Boron concentration of 2%, this means that about 250 Tons of Boron would be needed. For the Boron there are three possibilities 4:

Footnote 4: Source is the BORAX France, SA.

1. Use a natural ore of borate (Colemanite), used in nuclear concrete. It contains impurities like: Iron, Arsenic fluorid, Aluminum, Strontium, Silice. The Boron content 5, expressed in B\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{3}\) is around 40%. The cost is 1500 FF/Ton, which corresponds to 3\(\times\)10\({}^{6}\) FF for the 2% solution. Footnote 5: All the products contain B\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{3}\), with a percentage of Boron of 31%.
2. Use industrial borate as disodium tetraborate pentahydrate. It contains sodium as main impurity (Na\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{3}\) at 21.6%) and the Boron content, expressed in B\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{3}\) is of about 48-49%. The cost if of 3500 FF/Ton, which corresponds to 5.8\(\times\)10\({}^{6}\) FF for the 2% solution.
3. Use pure boric acid, which has a Boron content, expressed in B\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{3}\), of 56%. The cost is around 9000 FF/Ton. For a 2% Boron concentration about 12\(\times\)10\({}^{6}\) FF would be needed.

As it results from these numbers, the most economical solution is the Colemanite finely dispersed in the concrete. The reported costs is intended for mineral ground ready to be mixed. Further investigations with the Company that will execute the ATLAS civil engineering indicate that the actual price could be much higher due to the fact that the Colemanite could produce an important increase of the concrete setting time that should be studied in more details.

### The magnetic field

A schematic magnetic field is presently included in the FLUKA calculation (see e.g. last reference in [8]). A map of the magnetic field, as used for the ATLASIM simulation code, has been made available to be inserted in the FLUKA and MARS Monte Carlo. The map can be read from a data file (/afs/cern.ch/atlas/offline/data/BMAGATLA.DATA) via a fortran file ( mcobal/public/fluka/bmagatla.f).

## 6 The MARS Monte Carlo in the ATLAS radiation study

MARS is a program designed for the fast simulation of hadron cascades, electron-photon showers and muon transport in heterogeneous materials, in the energy range from several TeV to thermal energies (for neutrons). In MARS, only a limited number of particles are generated in the interaction, and the real multiplicity of the generated particles is taken into account via the introduction of particle weights. Energy and momentum are supposed to be unchanged over the several collisions which occur during the particles propagation. This Monte Carlo, although not useful for precise physics simulation like FLUKA, allows for estimation of mean values, such as particle fluxes, spectra and absorbed energy, and is therefore well suited for background studies. The geometry of the ATLAS detector included in the TP37 FLUKA version was implemented in MARS using an automatic geometry converter. This converter introduced some bugs when dealing with geometrical elements not symmetric in \(\phi\). Some time was spent in order to spot out the remaining differences.

The ATLAS magnetic field has been taken from ATLASIM (see previous section). A comparison of the two codes (MARS and FLUKA) for neutrons, \(\gamma\) and charged hadrons fluence distributions along the ATLAS muon stations was done. The neutrons and \(\gamma\) fluxes obtained with MARS are higher than the FLUKA ones ( a factor of about three for \(\eta\)\(>\)1). This discrepancy is not yet understood. The results obtained with MARS in the frame of these studies are described in note [6].

## 7 Proposal for a test beam

Inside this working group, a proposal has been made to perform a serie of test beams. The aim would be the experimental check of the ATLAS shielding calculations in order to:

* Reduce the present FLUKA uncertainties from a factor of five to a factor of two. The uncertainty comes mainly from three sources. The first one is the \(pp\) cross section which contributes with a factor of 1.3, and cannot be improved. The third one, which adds a factor of 2, is the detection efficiency. It is presently being investigated by the Boston, Dubna and Freiburg groups and can be reduced to less than 1.2. The test beams should reduce the second one, namely the Monte Carlo estimate, from its present value of 2.5 down to less than 1.5 6. Footnote 6: A. Ferrari, private communication.
* Provide facilities for shielding optimization studies (i.e.: exotic materials, activation studies). Various alternative shielding material were proposed at the Radiation and Shielding meetings, as the use of concrete walls doped with Boron, or the external layer of the forward shielding composed of borated or leaded concrete. The MARS simulations using these materials gave promising results (to be checked with FLUKA): to verify all this with the experiment is essential.

Previous studies in ATLAS on this subject were done on neutrons. No experimental work on \(\gamma\) has been performed. The neutron spectra are known with a good approximation in the low energy region, where the agreement between experiment and simulation is of the order of 20%. The detection of neutrons gives in principle no problems: the situation for the \(\gamma\) detection is different, since in this case the detector sees any kind of radiation, including the activation \(\gamma\). To have the same ATLAS radiation level on the muon chambers, one should have \(10^{8}\)-\(10^{9}\) protons/spill, crossing an iron wall of 1 m thickness 7. The test beam area where one would have such a high proton intensity is the ECN3 area, in the P0 line.
