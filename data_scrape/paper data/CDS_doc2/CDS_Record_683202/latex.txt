**Abstract**

The ratio between the numbers of streamer and proportional signals in a drift tube have been investigated at different diameters of the signal wire, gas gains and pressures of the gas mixture (_Ar_ 88%, \(CO_{2}\) 2%, \(N_{2}\) 5%, \(CH_{4}\) 5%). At a fixed charge of the proportional signals the streamer signal fraction increases with increase of the gas pressure or the signal wire diameter.

Aluminum pressurized drift tubes (MDT) are the basic element of the muon system of the ATLAS detector at LHC [1]. The simulation of the background in the MDT environment shows that at the LHC maximum luminosity the detector count rate may be as large as \(3\cdot 10^{3}\ \frac{Count}{cm^{2}\ sec}\)[1]. It means that one of the main requirements to the MDTs is radiation hardness.

The deterioration of the wire chamber performance under the irradiation (aging) depends on many factors, and the gas mixture composition is the main one. The aging is caused mainly by the production of polymers in the electron avalanche and their deposition on the inside surfaces of the detector. The rate of the polymers production is proportional to the electric current through the detector [2]. Therefore it is supposed to operate the MDTs in the proportional mode at rather small gas gain (\(\sim\)5\(\times 10^{4}\)). At the same time the presence of a small number of the streamer signals can sufficiently increase the average value of the signals. If, for example, the streamer signal amplitude is 100 times more than that of the proportional signals the presence of 1% streamer signals will double the aging rate. Therefore one of the requirements to the MDT gas mixture is the streamer signal fraction should be smaller than 1% [1].

The goal of the current work was to investigate the influence of the gas pressure and the sensitive wire diameter on the streamer and proportional signal ratio in the MDT filled with the _Ar_ 88%, \(CO_{2}\) 2%, \(N_{2}\) 5%, \(CH_{4}\) 5% gas mixture. At present it is one of candidates to be used in MDTs of the ATLAS muon system because the drift velocity in this mixture is approximately constant through a large part of the drift way in the MDT [3].

The experimental set-up is shown at Fig.1. The tested tube was located between

**Fig. 1: Experimental set-up.**two scintillator counters which registered the cosmic particle passing. The cosmic particles were detected within the range of the polar angle \(0\div 60^{\circ}\). The coincidence of the scintillator counter signals produced the "gate" signal for the analog-to-digit converter (ADC - LeCroy 2249W, 0.24 pC/channel). The time duration of the gate was 800 ns. The MDT signal was put in the ADC without any preamplification.

During the experiment three aluminum MDTs with anode wire diameters 50, 70 and 100 \(\mu\)m were irradiated. The MDTs 3 cm in diameter, 30 cm long and with 0.4 mm thick wall have been used. The gas pressure in the tubes was varied from 1 to 5 atm. The amplitude spectra of the MDT signals were measured at different voltages applied to the tube. Examples of typical measured spectra are shown at fig.2. The streamer to proportional signals ratio as well as the average charge in an event were calculated using the measured spectra.

Fig.3a shows the streamer signal fraction as a function of the average proportional signal charge in MDT with different anode wire diameter at the 3 atm pressure. One can see that wires of smaller diameter allow to obtain larger gas gain at a fixed fraction of streamer signals.

The average charge in an event is more crucial factor than the streamer signal fraction because the detector aging depends on the total deposited charge. The average charge in an event as a function of the average proportional signal charge is shown at the fig.3b. One can see that it is better to use wires of smaller diameter to decrease the aging rate.

The streamer signal fraction and the average charge in an event as functions of the average proportional signal charge at different gas pressures are shown at the fig.4. One can see that both these values increase with the increase of the pressure at a fixed charge of the proportional signal. This fact must be taken into account at a final choice of the MDT gas pressure.

The obtained results show that to decrease the aging rate one should use anode wires of smaller diameter and operate MDT at lower gas pressures.
