###### Abstract

The analog signals from monitored drift-tube-chambers are led to the preamplifiers of the on-chamber electronics through so-called hedgehog cards. The performances of the shielded and unshielded versions of these cards regarding the spatial resolution of the drift tubes are compared, with the result that the spatial resolution is degraded at most by 8 \(\mu\)m if shielded instead of unshielded cards are used. Therefore, shielded signal hedgedhog-cards are preferred because of their better protection against pick-up noise.

## 1 Introduction

In the ATLAS muon spectrometer, muon tracks are precisely measured by monitored drift-tube chambers. Investigations with prototype chambers in muon beams proved that an average spatial resolution of less than 100 \(\mu\)m in a single tube of a chamber is achievable [1][2]. At the moment, the muon community is facing the binding decision on the final design of the read-out of the drift-tube chambers.

The basic design of the read-out of the chambers looks as follows: bundles of 24 tubes - 4 times 6 tubes in quadruple-layer chambers and 3 times 8 tubesin triple-layer chambers (see Figure 1) - are connected to a single so-called _hedgehog card_.

The hedgehog card capacitively decouples the signals from the tubes and leads them to the so-called _mezzanine card_, which is located in a second level on the top of the hedgehog cards and contains the amplifiers, the shapers, the discriminators, and the time-to-digital converters for the signals of each of the 24 tubes connected to the hedgehog card.

The small unamplified signals have to flow a long distance (up to 12 cm) from the tube end to the preamplifier. Along this path, they are exposed to pick-up from the outside. In the first version of hedgehog cards, no protection against this pick-up has been foreseen; the signal lines are guided on the surface of the board without shielding (see Figure 2.a)). In a new version, the hedgehog cards are multilayer boards in which the unamplified signals are channeled between two grounded surface layers (see Figure 2.b)). These surface layers serve as a shielding for the signals against pick-up from the outside. The hedgehog cards of the new version are therefore called _shielded_ hedgehog cards in contrast to the _unshielded_ cards of the first version.

Though superior to the unshielded cards with respect to pick-up, the shielded cards come up with a higher noise level due to the higher capacitance introduced by the grounded surface layers. This additional capacitance may also increase the rise time of the signals. Both effects, higher noise level and larger rise time, potentially yield a decreased single-tube resolution.

In order to quantify the effect on the spatial resolution, measurements with both card versions were performed with a BOS chamber in the H8 muon beam at CERN in 2002.

## 2 Experimental Set-up

Figure 3 shows a sketch of the experimental set-up. The BOS chamber has been installed perpendicular to the beam with the tubes in vertical orientation. A scintillator hodoscope covering 50 cm of the tubes in vertical direction and 90 cm in horizontal direction was used to trigger the data acquisition and the time-to-digital converters on the chamber, which are stopped by the tube signals.

In order to compare the resolution which is achieved with the different kinds of hedgehog cards, a shielded card was used in the upstream triple layer of the chamber while an unshielded card was used in the downstream triple layer. The tubes were operated with Ar:CO\({}_{2}\)(93:7) at 3 bar pressure and 3080 V high voltage. Mezzanine light cards were used as on-chamber read-out electronics. Data at three different discriminator thresholds were taken: 51 mV 60 mV, and 77 mV. Almost a million muon tracks were recorded at each of the thresholds.

We shall first describe the analysis of the data taken with 60 mV threshold which is the nominal threshold. We then report on the results obtained at the other thresholds with the same strategy.

## 3 Calibration of the Drift-Tube Chamber

The chamber is calibrated in two steps: first the drift-time spectra of the tubes in the beam region are synchronized, second the space-to-drift-time relationship is determined.

### Synchronization of the Drift-Time Spectra

The drift tubes of the chamber measure the time interval \(\tau_{d}\) between the passage of the muons through the tube and the instance of time when the electrons that are the ionization products of the muon-atom collisions in the gas arrive at the anode wire. In practice, \(\tau_{d}\) is not measured directly, but the time interval

\[\tau_{m}:=t_{\mu}+\tau_{d}+\tau_{\mu,electronics}-t_{trig}, \tag{1}\]

where \(t_{\mu}\) is the time when the muon hits the tube, \(t_{trig}\) the time when the trigger gives the start pulse of the time-to-digital converter connected to the tube, and \(\tau_{\mu,electronics}\) is the propagation time of the signal. The term \(t_{\mu}+\tau_{\mu,electronics}-t_{trig}\) is the same for all events. However, it slightly differs from tube to tube because of different signal path lengths in the connected electronics. In order to determine this constant, the drift-time spectrum of each tube is analysed.

A typical drift-time spectrum is presented in Figure 4. The Fermi-like function

\[F(t_{drift}):=p_{0}+\frac{A_{0}}{1+e^{\frac{t_{drift}-t_{0}}{T_{0}}}} \tag{2}\]

with the parameters \(p_{0}\), \(A_{0}\), \(t_{0}\), \(T_{0}\) fitted to the sharp rising edge of the spectrum as described in [3]. The parameter \(t_{0}\) measures the position of this edge. The spectra of the tubes are synchronized to start at \(t_{drift}=0\) by shifting the drift time by the individual \(t_{0}\)s.

The function

\[G(t_{drift}):=\frac{A_{m}-\alpha_{m}t_{drift}}{1+e^{-\frac{t-t_{m}}{T_{m}}}}+p_{m}, \tag{3}\]

which is similar to \(F\) given in eq. 2, is used to describe the shape of the falling edge at the end of the spectrum. The position of the falling edge is given by \(t_{m}\). The difference \(t_{m}-t_{0}\) is a measure of the length of the drift-time spectrum. The statistical precision of \(t_{m}-t_{0}\) is 1 ns in the present case [3]. The variance of \(t_{m}-t_{0}\) measured in the data is \((1.9\pm 0.2)\) ns so that the length of the spectra agree on a level of \(\sqrt{1.9^{2}-1^{2}}\) ns=1.6 ns. No difference in the length of the spectra between the two triple layers is observed.

Yet there is a statistically significant difference in the rise time of the spectra controlled by the parameter \(4\cdot T_{0}\). In the shielded hedgehog case card its mean value is \((11.56\pm 0.08)\) ns while it is \((11.88\pm 0.08)\) ns for the unshielded card. As the rise time of the spectra is proportional to the spatial resolution close to the anode wire of the tubes, this is a first indication that the resolution is degraded by the use of the shielded cards, namely by \((2.69\pm 0.03)\%\). Since the spatial resolution close to the wire, i.e. at small drift times, is about 250 \(\mu\)m [2], this degradation corresponds to a decrease in resolution of about 7 \(\mu\)m.

### Determination of the Space-to-Drift-Time Relationship

The space-to-drift-time relationship determined in 1999 with a BOS chamber and a silicon telescope in the H8 test beam [2][4] serves as a good initial

Figure 4: Typical drift-time spectrum of a single tube. The functions \(F\) anf \(G\) fitted to the edges of the spectrum are shown as well.

estimate of the space-to-drift-time relationship for the present data. We define the variable \(r_{drift}\) as the drift radius calculated with the initial space-to-drift-time relationship and \(r_{track}\) as the distance of the track, which is reconstructed by means of the drift radii, from the anode wire of a tube crossed by the muon trajectory. The residual distribution \(r_{drift}-r_{track}\) as a function of \(r_{drift}\) shows a maximum mean deviation from 0 of at most 100 \(\mu\)m which indicates the high accuracy of the initial relationship. It was further tuned to the present data by requiring that the residual distribution is flat and its mean value equals 0.

## 4 Comparison of the Widths of the Triple Sum

Since the BOS chamber is hit perpendicularly by the straight muon track, the drift radius \(r_{1}\) measured in the first tube layer equals the drift radius \(r_{3}\) measured in the third tube layer of a triple layer, within the statistical errors, and differs from the radius measured in the second layer by 15.018 mm which is the radius of a drift tube (see Figure 5). The triple sum

\[\Sigma_{t}:=\frac{1}{2}(r_{1}+r_{3})+r_{2} \tag{4}\]

is therefore a constant (15.018 mm) within a statistical fluctuation \(\sigma_{\Sigma_{t}}\) which is related to the spatial resolution \(\sigma(r)\) of the drift tube according to

\[\sigma_{\Sigma_{t}} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{4}\left[\sigma^{2}(r_{1})+\sigma^{2}(r_{3}) \right]+\sigma^{2}(r_{2})} \tag{5}\] \[\stackrel{{ r_{1}\equiv r_{3}}}{{\equiv}}\sqrt{\frac {1}{2}\sigma^{2}(r_{1})+\sigma^{2}(r_{2})}.\]

Figure 5: Naming convention.

There are three simple cases in which one can easily calculate the width of the triple sum:

1. \(r_{1}\to 0\) (close to the wires of tube 1 and 3). In this case \(\sigma(r_{1})\gg\sigma(r_{2})\), hence \[\sigma_{\Sigma_{t}}\approx\frac{\sigma(0)}{\sqrt{2}}.\] (6)
2. \(r_{1}=r_{2}=r_{3}=7.5\) mm (in the middle of the tubes). In this case \(\sigma(r_{1})=\sigma(r_{2})\), hence \[\sigma_{\Sigma_{t}}=\sqrt{\frac{3}{2}}\,\sigma(7.5\ \mbox{mm}).\] (7)
3. \(r_{1}\to 15\) mm, hence \(r_{2}\to 0\) (close to the walls of tube 1 and 3). In this case \(\sigma(r_{1})\ll\sigma(r_{2})\), therefore \[\sigma_{\Sigma_{t}}\approx\sigma(0).\] (8)

If \(\sigma(0)\) is degraded by 7 \(\mu\)m for the shielded hedgehog card, then \(\sigma_{\Sigma_{t}}\) is increased by about the same amount compared to the unshielded card for \(r_{1}\to 0\) mm and \(r_{1}\to 15\) mm. Suppose the degradation at \(r=7.5\) mm is as large, the triple sum for the shielded cards should then be wider by about 9 \(\mu m\) than for the unshielded card.

The difference of the standard deviation of the triple sums measured in the triple layer with the shielded card and in the triple layer with the unshielded card is plotted in Figure 6. The triple sums are about 6 \(\mu\)m wider in the triple layer connected to the shielded hedgehog card than in the triple layer connected to the unshielded card. The difference agrees with the expectation from the difference in the rise times of the drift-time spectra, which is 7 \(\mu\)m for hits close to the wire.

## 5 Comparison of the Resolution Curves

### The Method

The spatial resolution curves \(\sigma_{shielded}(r)\) and \(\sigma_{unshielded}(r)\) for the shielded and unshielded cards are determined iteratively by reconstructing the muon trajectories.

Initially, the resolution curves \(\sigma_{shielded}(r)\) and \(\sigma_{unshielded}(r)\) are assumed to be equal. The resolution curve measured with a silicon telescope as external reference for a prototype version of the MDT electronics in 1999 [4] is taken as the first estimate of \(\sigma_{shielded}\) and \(\sigma_{unshielded}\). Tracks are reconstructed twice an event.

First, the muon trajectory is reconstructed leaving out one tube in the triple layer connected to the unshielded card. In the notation of Figure 7 this means that the trajectory is determined from the drift radii \(r_{1}\), \(r_{2}\), \(r_{3}\), \(r_{5}\), \(r_{6}\) while disregarding the radius \(r_{4}\). The distance of the reconstructed trajectory from the wire of tube 4 be \(r_{4,track}\) and its statistical uncertainty be \(\sigma_{4,track}\).

Figure 7: The two configurations entering the track reconstruction.

a) The hit \(r_{4}\) is disregarded in the reconstruction.

b) The hit \(r_{3}\) is disregarded in the reconstruction.

Second, the muon trajectory is reconstructed leaving out a tube in the triple layer connected to the shielded card. In the notation of Figure 7 this means that the trajectory is obtained from the radii \(r_{1}\), \(r_{2}\), \(r_{4}\), \(r_{5}\), and \(r_{6}\), but not \(r_{3}\). The distance of this trajectory from the wire of tube 3 be \(r_{3,track}\) while the statistical uncertainty of \(r_{3,track}\) be \(\sigma_{3,track}\).

The mean values of \(\sigma_{4,track}^{2}\) and \(\sigma_{3,track}^{2}\) and the variances of \((r_{4}-r_{4,track})\) and \((r_{3}-r_{3,track})\) are calculated for all events in 1 mm slices of \(r_{4,track}\) and \(r_{3,track}\) respectively ranging from 0.5 mm to 14.5 mm. The quantities

\[\sigma_{unshielded}^{new}:=\sqrt{Var(r_{4}-r_{4,track})-Mean(\sigma_{4,track }^{2})} \tag{9}\]

and

\[\sigma_{shielded}^{new}:=\sqrt{Var(r_{3}-r_{3,track})-Mean(\sigma_{3,track}^{ 2})} \tag{10}\]

are new estimates for \(\sigma_{unshielded}\) and \(\sigma_{shielded}\) as a function of \(r_{3,track}\) and \(r_{4,track}\) respectively.

If \(\max_{r}|\sigma_{(un)shielded}^{new}(r)-\sigma_{(un)shielded}(r)|>1\)\(\mu\)m, the iteration step described above is repeated with the new estimates \(\sigma_{unshielded}^{new}\) and \(\sigma_{shielded}^{new}\).

### Results Averaged over an Entire Hedgehog Card

Figure 8 shows the difference of the resolution curves \(\sigma_{shielded}\) and \(\sigma_{unshielded}\), which are obtained after the iteration procedure as a function of the drift

radius \(r\). In the region \(0\leq r\leq 7\) mm, \(\sigma_{shielded}\) is about 5 \(\mu\)m greater than \(\sigma_{unshielded}\) while it is the same as \(\sigma_{unshielded}\) for 7 mm\(<r\leq\)15 mm. If we assume that the shielding of the hedgehog card causes an additional uncertainty \(\delta t\) in the drift-time measurement, this uncertainty \(\delta t\) is linked to a difference in spatial resolution \(\delta\sigma\) by the simple relation

\[\delta\sigma=v(r)\cdot\delta t; \tag{11}\]

\(v(r)\) is the drift velocity at distance \(r\) from the anode wire. The drift velocity \(v\) equals 0.046 mm ns\({}^{-1}\) for hits close to the wire. Therefore, 5 \(\mu\)m resolution degradation at \(r=0\) corresponds to \(\delta=0.1\) ns additional timing uncertainty. The dashed line in Figure 8 represents the resolution degradation as expected from equation (11) with \(\delta t=0.1\) ns and \(v(r)\) as given in [4]. The measured values are in accord with this expectation.

### Result Depending on the Beam-Position on the Card

The results presented above are the average result for an entire hedgehog card. Since the observed resolution degradation is due to the additional capacitance introduced by the shielding, the absolute value of the degradation should depend on the position on the card; the length of the traces from tube to amplifier (thus the additional capacitance) varies between about 5 to 15 cm. Therefore, the additional capacitance is small in the middle of the card, while it is large at the edge of the card. We expect the resolution to be more degraded in tubes connected to the edge of the card than in those connected to the centre of the card.

According to Figure 9, the resolution is not degraded in the middle of the card, while, at the edge of the cards, it is degraded by 8 \(\mu\)m for hits close to the wire.

### Comment on the Results at Different Thresholds

Our results hold for a discriminator threshold of 60 mV. Similar results are obtained for 51 mV and 77 mV threshold (see Figure 10). The degradation is a bit smaller at the lower than at the nominal threshold and a bit larger at the higher threshold. One would expect such a behaviour since the timing uncertainties increase with the treshold.

## 6 Summary

We have shown that the use of shielded signal hedgehog-cards leads to a small degradation in spatial resolution of 6 \(\mu\)m on the average for hits close to the wire. As to the dependence of the resolution on the location of the tube in the hedgehog card, we find the resolution is unaltered in the middle of the hedgehog cards while it is degraded by 8 \(\mu\)m at the edge of the card. This behaviour is consistent with the assumption that the additional capacitance introduced by shielding is the origin of the resolution degradation.
