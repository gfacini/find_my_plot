The sensitivity of the ATLAS muon system Monitored Drift Tube (MDT) to fast neutrons has been measured using a 5.5 MeV Van de Graaff accelerator at the University of Massachusetts at Lowell. The neutrons are produced in a \({}^{7}\)Li\((p,n)^{7}\)Be reaction. The neutron energy of the facility ranges from 0.230 MeV to 3.388 MeV. Two ATLAS drift tubes were exposed to the neutron beam, with operating wire voltage of 3270 Volts, and 3 atm pressure of argon-carbon dioxide -nitrogen-methane gas mixture (94:3:2:1). The major mechanism of neutron induced signals in the drift tubes is the elastic collisions between the neutrons and the gas nuclei. The recoil nuclei lose kinetic energy in the gas and produce the signals. During our experiment, the total neutron fluence was measured with a uranium fission chamber. Combining the measured signal rate and the total neutron fluency, the neutron signal efficiency in the above drift gas mixture at 3 atm was determined to be \((3.92\pm 0.39)\times 10^{-4}\) for 0.5 MeV neutrons. We also developed a sophisticated simulation model to calculate the neutron induced signal rate and signal spectrum. The calculations agree with the measurement very well. This model can be used to calculate the MDT sensitivity for neutron energies beyond the accelerator energy range.

Introduction

The measurement of the fast neutron sensitivity of the MDTs is a critical R&D task for ATLAS muon spectrometer design, particularly for the muon trigger and detector shielding design. The issue is to understand the response of the primary muon detector element, the monitored drift tube, in the LHC's high-radiation environment. The main sources of the radiation background are very low-energy photons, neutrons, muons, and charged hadrons produced by interactions in the beam pipe wall, the forward most calorimeters, the collimators, and the magnet quadrapole. The MDTs in the end-cap muon system will encounter a very high background of neutrons and photons. The expected rates from such background are estimated to be up to 10 kHz/cm\({}^{2}\).

The sensitivity of the MDT detectors to such background has not yet been measured accurately. Previous efforts to take measurements were hampered by the lack of irradiation facilities with well-calibrated, clean photon and neutron sources. In order to optimize the muon spectrometer's performance, it is of critical importance to more accurately gauge the response of the MDTs in a high-radiation environment. We have proposed to the ATLAS collaboration (July, 1997) to make accurate measurements of the MDTs' sensitivity to fast neutrons (\(E_{n}>100KeV\)). The goal is to reduce the measurement uncertainties from 100-200% to a more acceptable 10%. The University of Massachusetts at Lowell near Boston has a suitable facility for such studies. The facility can produce well-calibrated mono-energetic neutrons produced in a \({}^{7}\)Li\((p,n)^{7}\)Be reaction, with a relatively small portion of associated gamma radiation. Using proton beams of different energies to hit the thin Li target, we can obtain different energy neutrons ranging from 0.23 MeV to 3.88 MeV. The accelerator at Lowell is operated with proton beam current of 10 \(\mu A\), which will hit a thin lithium target and provide the neutron beam with an energy spread of about 50 \(KeV\) and a fluence of order \(3\times 10^{8}n/s/sr\) in the forward beam direction.

We conducted our first neutron test on Nov. 1, 1997 in two 8-hour shifts. In this test we exposed two ATLAS drift tubes (90 cm long Pavia tubes) to 0.5 MeV and 2.3 MeV neutron beams. The objectives of our first experiment include:

* To understand the neutron facility radiation environment, particularly the photon background contamination;
* To measure the MDT neutron signal efficiency with the present ATLAS'standard' gas mixture (Ar-94%, CO\({}_{2}\)-3%, N\({}_{2}\)-2%, CH\({}_{4}\)-1%) accurate to 10%;
* To develop a simulation model to calculate the MDT sensitivity to the neutrons and to compare the predictions of our model to the measured data.

We report our test setup and the results of our analysis in detail in this note. Weplan to conduct another test using a different gas mixture at Lowell in August. New results will be reported by the end of this year.

## 2 MDT Test at the Lowell Neutron Facility

### Neutron Facility

The facility at Lowell consists of a 5.5 MeV Van de Graaff proton accelerator, which by shooting protons at a thin metallic lithium target, is capable of producing a monochromatic source of neutrons with relatively small background gamma radiation. It has been established by earlier experiments that this small gamma background is effectively isotropic in space, while the neutron fluence is highly peaked in the forward direction. There is also a virtual absence of slow neutrons (E \(<\) 10 keV), with a slow-to-fast ratio of less than 0.1% [1]. The proton beam current that the facility is capable of producing is about 10 \(\mu\)A, although during our neutron test run, the proton current used was about 6 \(\mu\)A. The neutron energy spectrum which can be produced by this facility is between 0.23 MeV and 3.38 MeV, continuously [1]. Table 1 summarizes the proton energy range and the corresponding neutron energies.

The reaction used to produce neutrons from a beam of protons is through the following reaction:

\[p\ +\ ^{7}Li\ =\ ^{7}Be\ +\ n\.\]

Figure 1 depicts the decay cycle involved in the production of neutrons. This diagram is not entirely accurate with respect to our experimental set-up since we used a thin lithium target and a proton beam energy of approximately 2.24 MeV. The diagram was drawn from data gathered using a thick lithium target and a 4.0 MeV proton beam energy. Therefore, the numbers shown in the diagram are not directly applied to our experiment. We have only included it to illustrate the reaction cycle involved in the production of neutrons using a lithium target and a beam of incident protons.

From the diagram, one can see that there are actually two groups of neutrons which are produced by the reaction. The \(n_{1}\) group occurs when the \(\ {}^{8}Be\) decays to the first excited state of \(\ {}^{7}Be\), rather than to the ground state. This results in a neutron of lower energy being emitted in the reaction. The proportion of neutrons

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|} \hline \(E_{p}\) (MeV) & 2.2 & 2.25 & 2.5 & 3.0 & 3.5 & 4.0 & 4.5 & 5.0 & 5.5 \\ \hline \(E_{n}\) (MeV) &.230 &.518 &.786 & 1.306 & 1.816 & 2.323 & 2.376 & 2.883 & 3.388 \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 1: Proton beam energies and corresponding neutron energies at a fixed neutron angle (\(\theta\) = 0\({}^{\circ}\)).

in the \(n_{0}\) group to those in the \(n_{1}\) group is a function of the incident proton energy. The energy threshold of the proton beam necessary for producing any neutrons in the first group \(n_{0}\) is 1.881 MeV, while the threshold for producing neutrons in the second group is 2.373 MeV. Most of the data used for analysis in this paper was taken at a neutron energy of 0.5 MeV, which corresponds to a proton energy of about 2.24 MeV; well below the threshold of the second group. Therefore, when using data obtained at this energy, we do not worry about neutrons of the \(n_{1}\) variety. Our other group of data is at a neutron energy of 2.3 MeV, which corresponds to a proton energy of about 4 MeV. In this case, we do have to consider the effects of neutrons in the second group. However, in out test, the neutron fluence was not accurately recorded during the run at this energy, the 2.3 MeV data has not been used for any important calculations.

One important detail requiring careful consideration at the Lowell neutron facility is that the energy of the neutrons, while almost completely mono-energetic in the forward direction, actually decreases with angle \(\theta\) away from the forward direction. In the experiment performed at Lowell the MDTs were irradiated by neutrons up to \(60^{\circ}\) away from the forward trajectory. Figure 2 shows two graphs, the first of which is a graph of the differential cross section as a function of the angle \(\theta\) of the neutron trajectory away from the forward direction. The cross section is proportional to the number of neutrons incident at that angle, so this graph illustrates the forward peaked

Figure 1: Decay cycle for neutron production [1].

nature of the neutron fluence. The second graph shown below gives the neutron energy as a function of the angle of emission \(\theta\).

When we determine the neutron fluence and develop our simulation model, the effects of this angular dependence must be taken into account.

In our first test we also learned that there are two kinds of gamma background sources in the neutron facility: (1) gammas from the beam line that associate with the proton and Lithium reactions; (2) gammas from the experiment hall due to the neutron absorption by the walls and other materials in the hall. During the test, we have used a gamma detector to monitor the gamma background near the drift tube detectors. We found that the beam associated gammas can be efficiently shielded out by a one-inch lead block. The level of the overall gamma background from the experiment hall was found to be small, and could be subtracted in the off-line data analysis process.

Figure 2: Cross section and neutron energy as a function of neutron emission angle \(\theta\) (in degrees) [2].

In order to confirm that the majority of the signals being recorded were due primarily to neutron interactions with the chamber gas, we ran a test with the MDT tubes almost completely encased in a 2" thick lead house. The signal rate recorded during this run was decreased only by about 20%. A 2" lead barrier is thick enough to stop over 90% of gamma radiation. When one accounts for the fact that at least 10% of the neutrons would be stopped by the lead barrier, the natural conclusion is that the majority of our measured signals, even without the lead house, are dominantly induced by neutron interactions.

### The Experiment

Figure 3 is a diagram of the experimental setup used at the Lowell facility (not drawn to scale).

The test process begins when the proton beam exits the pipe and strikes the thin lithium target. The neutrons are emitted from the target, where they immediately pass through a small uranium fission chamber about 4.92 cm from the target. The angles of coverage of the fission chamber are approximately 60\({}^{\circ}\) in either direction. (Note: our MDT drift chambers extend over this same range of angles.) Behind the fission chamber, there is a 1" lead barrier, so that beam associated gamma radiation from the reaction is stopped. The test MDTs are located behind

Figure 3: Schematic of neutron test beam set up

the shielding lead blocks with two different distances from the target: 51.25 inches and 9 inches, in different test runs. The purpose for running the test at two different distances is to subtract out the gamma background.

The signals from both ends of the tube are amplified. (We have used the amplifiers of the type used for the L3 forward/backward muon system [3]). Negative outputs from the amplifiers are sent to discriminators with thresholds at 30 mV (corresponding to \(\sim 200\) eV energy threshold based on \({}^{55}Fe\) calibration), which are used in coincidence to form a self trigger for each tube. The trigger activates the LRS 4950 digital scope to record the waveforms and signal rate. The signal rate measurement was made using a NIM scaler (data from scalar is recorded by the the physicists running the shift). The positive outputs are sent to digital oscilloscopes. For one tube, a time-amplitude converter (TAC) was also used to record the time difference between signals from the two ends of the tube (1 volt = 5 ns), enabling one to localize the occurrence of the event in the tube. In addition, a two scintillator cosmic ray trigger was used to calibrate the drift tubes to cosmic rays before, during, and after the neutron exposure (the leading edges of cosmic ray pulses were found to be typically greater than 100 mV, see Figure 4). The MDT signal waveforms induced by neutrons are shown in Figure 5. We have also taken some gamma signal waveforms by directing the proton beam off the Li target, and removing the lead shield block. The gamma induced signal waveforms are shown in Figure 6. The waveform data and time difference data (the output of the TAC) are passed to the computer using a General Processing Interface Board (GPIB).

The shape of the waveforms that we observe from muons, neutron, and \(\gamma\) rays interacting with the gas in the MDTs are actually quite different from one another. Notice that the gamma waveforms are much more localized than the neutron and muon waveforms. The muon signals are typically broader in shape than the neutron induced signals. This is because the muons ionize the gas all the way along their trajectories, whereas the neutron induced signals are normally much more localized (due to short range of the low energy recoil ion). They have a variety of shapes because the neutrons collide with different gas atoms resulting in quite different recoil energies of the nuclei. For example, the little 'pulses' are most likely due to an argon signal, since argon is heavy and the recoil energy is small. The saturated signal corresponds to a neutron-hydrogen collision, since the resulting proton would have a high recoil energy, causing a streamer mode signal in the drift tube.

The signal spectra (integrated voltage signal from the waveforms) for cosmic ray muons and 0.5 MeV neutrons are presented in Figure 7.

As we expected from the waveforms, the energy spectra obtained for muon, neutron and gamma are quite different. The cosmic ray muon spectrum shows the typical MIP (minimum ionization particle) MDT signal size. However the neutron spectrum presents a combination of different energies deposited by the recoil nuclei. Keeping in

mind that the neutron collision will result in a higher recoil energy for lighter atoms, the shape of the neutron spectrum is something like we would expect. Since the argon atoms makes up about 94% of the gas mixture, we expect the majority of collisions to be with argon, rather than carbon, nitrogen, oxygen or hydrogen. The largest amount of signal appears in the energy regime corresponding to the argon recoil energy. The lump in the data appearing in regions of higher recoil energy was at first a bit surprising, since those energies correspond to neutron collisions with hydrogen, which should be a flat tail. However after inspecting the waveforms we realized that quite often the amplifier saturated, which in our integrated voltage signal appears to be an unexpectedly large amount of signal. If the amplifier becomes saturated, it does not matter how high the voltage really is, it always records the energy in the same place, so the tail of the curve piles up at the saturated level. The explanation for the dip around channels 80-100 in the histogram is provided by the phenomenon of limited streamers, which is a result of an increase of electric field near the tail of an electron avalanche, due to accumulation of slower moving positive ions in this region.

Figure 8 shows a histogram of voltage measurements recorded by the TAC module. This records the time difference between signals from the two ends of the tube (1 volt = 5 ns), enabling one to localize the event in the tube. We have calibrated the TAC so that the center of the tube (45 cm) registers 2.3 volts. The signal from the two ends are approximately at 1.5 and 3 volts, respectively. The little bumps in the distribution near these values correspond to the tube end plugs. The asymmetric shape between left and right side is due to the gas connectors made of G10 material located in the right side, which cause some induced signals in the MDT. This diagram confirms our hypothesis that the majority of the neutrons pass through the center of the tube, rather than at high angles near the end plugs.

In order to determine the MDT sensitivity to neutrons, we need to use data recorded by the Lowell physicists who were operating the accelerator for our test. They recorded the proton beam energies, with which we calculated the neutron energies. They also recorded the neutron fluence with a uranium fission chamber, and they provided measurements of the proton beam current. These items will be used later to calculate the average neutron flux.

### Neutron Sensitivity Determination

We used the data that we obtained at Lowell to determine the measured sensitivity of the MDT tubes to neutrons striking them at 0.5 MeV. In order to do this, we need to determine the detector's geometric acceptance, the neutron signal rate, and the neutron flux. The calculations for determining each of these quantities are described in the sections below.

Figure 8: The TAC (time-amplitude converter) signal distribution. The signal from the center of the tube is corresponding to approximate 2.3 volt; two ends are approximately at 1.5 and 3 volts.

#### 2.3.1 Geometric Acceptance

Geometric acceptance calculations needed include the uranium fission chamber solid angle coverage at the time of calibration and for our test. We must also determine the MDT solid angle coverage for different distances of the MDTs from the Lithium target.

The uranium chamber is a thin walled aluminum cylindrical chamber, which has a radius of 6.35 cm. The thickness of the chamber is about 2.54 cm. Inside the chamber very thin layers of uranium are placed on the two inner surfaces of the chamber. Neutrons interact with the uranium atoms, and produce signals (counts) in the chamber's sensitive gas. During our test, the center of the uranium chamber was located at a distance of 4.92 cm from the target. Thus, the uranium chamber solid angle coverage (\(\Omega_{test}\)) is 2.4349 sr.

We were provided the chamber calibration data for a neutron energy of 0.5 MeV by the Lowell physicists:

\[\langle\eta_{0}\rangle\ \ \Delta\Omega_{cal}=3.33\times 10^{-7},\]

where \(\langle\eta_{0}\rangle\) is the average efficiency of the chamber, and \(\Omega_{cal}\) is its acceptance when the chamber was located at a distance of 19.05 cm from the target, which corresponds to a solid angle coverage of.3224 sr.

The geometric acceptance of the 90 cm tube is.234 sr for a distance of 9 inches from the target, and.015 when the distance is 51.25 inches. The \(\theta\) angle coverage was between -60\({}^{\circ}\) and +60\({}^{\circ}\) when the tube was at a 9 inches distance from the target.

#### 2.3.2 Neutron Flux

For the 0.5 MeV neutron beam run during our test, the data recorded by the uranium fission chamber was the following:

\[\mbox{Data Rate (fission chamber)}=1.4\times 10^{6}\ \ \mbox{counts/hr}\ \ =\ 388\ \ \mbox{counts/sec}.\]

Thus the average neutron flux (\(F_{n}\)) can be determined by the following formula:

\[\langle F_{n}\rangle=\frac{Rate\,e}{\langle\eta\rangle\Delta\Omega_{test}},\]

where \(\langle\eta\rangle\) is the average fission chamber efficiency corresponding to the fission chamber acceptance \(\Omega_{test}\) during our test.

Using the calibration information for 0.5 MeV neutrons:

\[\langle\eta_{0}\rangle\ \ \Delta\Omega_{cal}=3.33\times 10^{-7}\]we obtained the average efficiency of the fission chamber in the calibration:

\[\langle\eta_{0}\,\rangle=\frac{3.33\times 10^{-7}}{.3244}=1.03\times 10^{-6}.\]

Because of the different angular coverage of the uranium chamber during the test, the average efficiency determined from calibration must be corrected in order to determine the neutron flux accurately. This is because the interaction cross sections for neutrons hitting uranium atoms depend a great deal on the neutron energies, thus, depend on the angle \(\theta\). The \(\theta\) angle coverage during the calibration was \(40^{\circ}\), while during our test it was \(60^{\circ}\). The average energy, weighted by the cross section for these two cases can be obtained with the expression below,

\[\langle E\rangle=\frac{1}{\sum_{i}\sigma_{i}}\sum_{i}\sigma_{i}E_{i}\.\]

Using the formula above, we obtain

\[For\ \ i=1-40^{\circ}:\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \langle E\rangle=.475\ \ MeV\]

\[For\ \ i=1-60^{\circ}:\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \langle E\rangle=.454\ \ MeV\]

for each of the average energies found above, the neutron-uranium cross sections are

\[\sigma(0.475\ \ MeV)=7.042\ \ barns,\]

\[\sigma(0.454\ \ MeV)=7.167\ \ barns.\]

We therefore determine the average chamber efficiency for our test (MDT located at 9 inches):

\[\langle\eta\rangle=\langle\eta_{0}\,\rangle\times\frac{7.167}{7.042}=1.048 \times 10^{-6}.\]

The average neutron flux during our test is determined below

\[\langle F_{n}\,\rangle=\frac{388}{(1.048\times 10^{-6})(2.435)}=\ 1.57\times 10^{8 }\ \ n/sec-sr\.\]

#### 2.3.3 Measured Neutron Induced Signal Rate

One method which can be used to obtain the neutron induced signal rate is to use two separate sets of data, each taken at a different distance from the target, and subtract out the gamma radiation. This is possible because of our original assumption that the gamma rate in the experiment hall is basically isotropic. Even if this is not strictly true, because the change in distance is quite small compared to the size of the hall,this method is still a very good approximation. Below we denote \(R_{1}\) and \(R_{2}\) to be the total measured MDT signal rates at 9" and 51.25" distances, respectively; \(R_{\gamma}\) to be the gamma induced signal rate; and \(R_{n}\) and \(R_{n}^{\prime}\) to be the neutron induced signal rates for different distances. The recorded signal rates induced in the MDTs are the following:

\[R_{1}=R_{\gamma}+R_{n}=11.461\;\;kHz\;\;\;\;\;\;\;for\;\;\;d=9"\ ;;\]

\[R_{2}=R_{\gamma}+R_{n}^{\prime}=1.731\;\;\;\;kHz\;\;\;\;for\;\;\;d=51.25"\.\]

Therefore, subtracting the gamma signal we obtain the following relation between the total signal and the neutron signal rates:

\[R_{1}-R_{2}=R_{n}\;\;\bigl{(}1-\frac{R_{n}^{\prime}}{R_{n}}\bigr{)}.\]

Since the neutron rate is proportional to the solid angle coverage, this becomes

\[R_{1}-R_{2}=R_{n}\;\;\bigl{(}1-\frac{\Omega_{2}}{\Omega_{1}}\bigr{)}\]

\[R_{n}=\frac{R_{1}-R_{2}}{1-(\Omega_{2}/\Omega_{1})},\;\;\;\;\;for\;\;d=9"\.\]

The neutron induced signal rate in the MDTs is therefore

\[R_{n}=10.39\;\;kHz,\;\;\;\;\;at\;\;\;\;\;d=9"\.\]

#### 2.3.4 Sensitivity Determination

Finally, after having determined the neutron flux and the rate of the neutron induced signal, we are able to determine the sensitivity of the MDT tubes to neutrons of 0.5 MeV. However there is a slight complication, because the neutron flux, in fact, was reduced before neutrons hit the MDT due to all of the obstructions between the target and the chamber. In order to account for this we must determine the percent of incident neutrons which are stopped or deflected inside the intermediate material. To deal with this problem, we have used the Monte Carlo Ionization Chamber Analysis Package (MICAP) [4] to perform a calculation of the percentage of the flux reduction. This calculation accounts for the 1" lead barrier, the aluminum fission chamber, and the 0.4 mm of aluminum tube wall through which the neutrons must pass. The result of the calculation is that the reduction in \(\langle F_{n}\rangle\) due to these intermediate materials is approximately 28%. This means that about 72% of the neutrons actually reach the MDTs. Taking this into account, the following is an evaluation of the neutron sensitivity of the MDT drift chamber at 0.5 MeV:

\[\varepsilon_{MDT}=\frac{R_{n}}{\langle F_{n}\rangle\times\Omega_{1}\times.72}= \;\;3.92\times 10^{-4}\]

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:18]

### Results of the Lowell Experiment

We learned several things from our first experiment at Lowell. From the different waveforms, we confirmed that it was possible to distinguish a neutron induced signal from a muon signal. Analysis of the integrated voltage signal in the MDT yielded both expected and unexpected results. While it's true that signals in the Ar recoil energy range dominated, we did get many signals in the recoil ranges of the other gas atoms, especially the hydrogen. The peak in the proton recoil energy range was rather unexpected, but we have attributed it to the phenomenon of limited streamers, and also the saturation of our amplifier. We also were able to confirm that the background gamma radiation was indeed rather small at the Lowell facility, making it an excellent choice for any further neutron studies we wish to do.

The most important result we obtained, however, is the measured neutron sensitivity of the MDT chamber to neutrons of 0.5 MeV. We found that when the rate of neutron induced signals given by

\[R_{n}=10.39\pm.74\ \ \ kHz\ \ \ \ (d=9\ in\,che\,s),\]

and a neutron fluence of

\[\langle F_{n}\rangle=(1.57\pm.08)\times 10^{8}\ \ \ n/sec-sr,\]

then the MDT efficiency to 0.5 MeV neutrons is

\[\Delta\varepsilon_{MDT}=(3.92\pm.39)\times 10^{-4}.\]Development of a Simulation Model

### Introduction

Creating a computer model to simulate the rate and size of the signal induced when neutrons of a particular energy hit an MDT chamber is not a straight forward business of simply coding a GEANT based simulation program. Great care must be taken for the following factors:

* The neutron transportation code should use the accurate cross sections between the neutrons and the medium atoms. At low energy ranges, the real cross sections are often not _smooth_, such feature should not be _averaged_ out by the simulation program, otherwise it would result in inaccurate results. This means we cannot use the usual hadronic tracking routine (GHEISHA) in GEANT.
* Calculation of energy loss for ionizing particles to induce a MDT electronic signal cannot simply use the _standard_ Bethe-Bloch formula, since it applies to relativistic charged particles. Here we are dealing with very low energy nuclei recoiled by the neutrons. In this energy regime (\(0-a\) few hundreds \(KeV\)), nuclear stopping power is significant. However, energy lost in this way will not result in observable electronic signals. A more sophisticated model is required to simulate the electronic energy loss of the low energy nuclear ions in the MDTs.
* The material description should be exact. Specially, the drift gas components cannot simply use an averaged atomic number and mass. In such way the result will not be correct.

Luckily, it was not necessary to completely re-invent the wheel; some work has already been done concerning simulation of neutrons passing through material. Specifically, we found that the GEANT-MICAP Monte Carlo simulation package is particularly suited to our needs since it uses the GEANT framework to handle the detector geometry and material, and uses the _exact_ measured cross sections to simulate the interactions between the low energy (\(E<20MeV\)) recoil nuclei and the other atoms in the medium (very often, the cross section curves are not'smooth' as a function of energy). Therefore we were able to use the output of this package (the recoil element atomic number \(Z\) and mass \(A\), and the recoil energy) together with theoretical calculations by J. Lindhard et al.[5] to calculate the electronic energy loss of the low energy recoil ions, and thus to accurately reproduce the energy spectra and MDT sensitivities as a function of neutron energy.

### Order of Magnitude Calculation

Before we started assembling our computer simulation model, we felt it would be wise to make a simple order of magnitude calculation to indicate to us what sort of numbers we hope to achieve. This would also re-confirm that the results we obtained at Lowell are somewhat reasonable. To determine the probability that a neutron will interact with the gas atoms in the chamber, we would like to calculate the mean collision length \(\lambda\) from the total cross section. A simple formula for obtaining the total cross section is

\[\Sigma=\sum_{i}N_{i}\sigma_{i}\ \ \ \ where\ \ \ \ N_{i}=\frac{\rho_{i}}{A_{i}}\ \ N_{A},\]

where \(\sigma_{i}\) is the cross section of the neutron interacting with the \(i^{th}\) atom in the drift gas, \(N_{i}\) is the number of atoms in one mole of gas of the \(i^{th}\) atom, and \(N_{A}\) represents Avagadro's constant in this expression. The important thing to determine is the density of each gas component. At one atmosphere, the densities of the gas components in (g/cc) are given in the Table 2:

To calculate the density of each element in our gas mixture we must use the expression

\[\rho_{i}=\rho_{gas}\times\%\ \ in\ \ mixture\times\mathit{pressure}\ \ (\mathit{Atm})\times weight,\]

where _weight_ is the mass weight of the \(i^{th}\) atom in the individual gas component. For example, the H atom weight in the CH\({}_{4}\) gas component has a weight of 0.25. Of course, since we are interested in the density of atoms of each element, any element which appears more than once must be accounted for when using this formula. For example, since carbon appears in two different gases in the mixture, the expression for \(\rho_{C}\) will have two terms. Table 3 summarizes all of the information gathered for calculating the mean collision length. In the table the \(\lambda_{i}\) term represents the mean collision length of the neutron if all the other elements were missing from the gas.

Using the expression for total cross section given above, we determined that the total cross section is

\[\Sigma=1.34\times 10^{-4}\ \ \frac{1}{\mathit{cm}},\]

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|} \hline Gas component & Density (\(\rho_{gas}\,in\,g/cc\)) & \% in Mixture \\ \hline Ar & 0.001782 & 94\% \\ CO\({}_{2}\) & 0.01977 & 3\% \\ N\({}_{2}\) & 0.001250 & 2\% \\ CH\({}_{4}\) & 0.0007138 & 1\% \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 2: Densities of the gas components in mixture.

and the total mean collision length is

\[\lambda_{total}=\frac{1}{\Sigma}=744\,3.3\ \ cm.\]

The probability of an interaction between the neutron and the gas atoms is simply the total cross section of interaction multiplied by the path length travelled by the neutron. For the purposes of this simple calculation we will make the assumption that the path length is approximately 3 cm, the diameter of the tube. The implication of this assumption is that the neutrons are travelling straight through in a perpendicular direction, which in the case of the Lowell test, is a fairly good approximation. The result is that

\[Probability=3.0\ cm\ \times 1.34\times 10^{-4}\ \ \frac{1}{cm}\ \ =4.02\times 10^{-4}.\]

Note that this result is not too different from our experimental measurement of the sensitivity of the MDT tubes. This is very encouraging.

### Maximum Energy Transfer Calculation

Once the atoms in the gas have been hit by a neutron, they acquire some recoil energy, which they can then deposit in the tube, causing a signal. But how big are these energies? In this section we consider the maximum amount of energy transferable to the various gas atoms by neutrons of 0.5 and 2.3 MeV. The maximum amount of energy the neutron can give a gas atom in an elastic collision can be obtained by considering a head-on one dimensional collision. Any angular scattering would multiply the result by cosine of that angle, which will be less than one. (Note that any two particle collision can be considered two dimensionally by rotating the coordinate system).

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|} \hline Elements & Ar & C & O & N & H \\ \hline Cross section \(\sigma_{i}\) (b) & 1.142 & 3.373 & 4.732 & 2.281 & 6.140 \\ Density \(\rho_{i}\) (g/cc) & 5.025\(\times 10^{-3}\) & 6.423\(\times 10^{-5}\) & 1.299\(\times 10^{-4}\) & 7.5\(\times 10^{-5}\) & 5.4\(\times 10^{-6}\) \\ \(A_{i}\) & 40 & 12 & 16 & 14 & 1 \\ \(N_{i}\) & 7.566\(\times 10^{19}\) & 3.217\(\times 10^{18}\) & 4.887\(\times 10^{18}\) & 3.226\(\times 10^{18}\) & 1.075\(\times 10^{18}\) \\ \(\lambda_{i}\) & 11573.3 & 92162.7 & 43223.2 & 135894.1 & 151551.4 \\ \hline \end{tabular}

\[m\stackrel{{\rightharpoons}}{{v}}_{i}=m\stackrel{{ \rightharpoons}}{{v}}_{f}+M\stackrel{{\rightharpoons}}{{V}}\] \[\frac{1}{2}mv_{i}^{2} = \frac{1}{2}mv_{f}^{2}+\frac{1}{2}MV^{2}\]

We can determine the \(v_{f}\) and \(V\) in final state, thus the maximum recoil energy of the nuclei \(E_{R}\) is related to the neutron initial energy \(E_{n}\) as the following:

\[E_{R}=\frac{4m\,M}{(m+M)^{2}}\;\;E_{n}.\]

The calculated results are presented in Table 4.

These energies of the recoil nuclei are very low. For

atoms. Nuclear stopping power is the energy loss per unit length that the nucleus loses due to atomic collisions which add to the kinetic energy of the gas atoms, but do not result in internal excitation. The proportion of electronic to nuclear stopping power depends on the recoil energy of the nucleus. As mentioned above, if the recoil energy were very large, the nuclear stopping power would be very small compared to the electronic. However, in the energy range of the recoil gas atoms from neutron collisions, the nuclear stopping power plays a significant role in the energy loss of the recoil nucleus. This is why the theory of J. Lindhard et al.[5][6] is a particularly good treatment for the problem we are considering in the MDTs; the Lindhard model takes the nuclear stopping carefully into account. The theory is developed over a series of several papers entitled "Notes on Atomic Collisions." The papers we have primarily used in our calculations are articles II and III of that series [5][6].

Let us call the energy loss due to electronic stopping power \(\eta\) and the energy loss due to nuclear stopping power \(\nu\). Then Lindhard tells us that

\[E_{R}=\eta(E_{R})+\nu(E_{R}).\]

Notice that \(\eta\) and \(\nu\) are both functions of energy, \(E_{R}\), suppose the recoil nucleus loses all of its energy in the gas. We are interested in knowing what portion of this energy was lost in electronic excitation or ionization, since these are the interactions that will result in the production of a signal in the MDT. Specifically we are interested in the fraction

\[\frac{\eta(E_{R})}{E_{R}}=\frac{\eta(E_{R})}{\eta(E_{R})+\nu(E_{R})}\]

The total stopping power is

\[\left(\frac{dE}{dx}\right)_{tot}=\left(\frac{dE}{dx}\right)_{el}+\left(\frac{ dE}{dx}\right)_{nucl}\]

We then can determine the electronic energy loss by the following integral:

\[\eta(E_{R})=-\int_{E_{R}}^{0}\frac{(dE/dx)_{el}}{(dE/dx)_{el}+(dE/dx)_{nuc}}dE\]

For our modelling program, we would like to obtain a graph of the fraction as a function of recoil energy. This means that for each possible energy we would like to evaluate the integral above and make a continuous graph. But there is one slight inconvenience involved with this as we have written it. So far we have not talked about an expression for dE/dx. The following is an expression for the electronic stopping power:

\[\left(\frac{dE}{dx}\right)_{el}=N\;\xi_{e}\;8\pi a_{0}\;\hbar\;\frac{Z_{1}Z_{ 2}}{Z}\;\;v\]

Where \(N=\) number density of atoms/volume, \(\xi_{e}\sim Z_{1}^{1/6}\), \(a_{0}=\)Bohr radius, v = velocity, \(Z_{1}=\) atomic number of the recoil nucleus, \(Z_{2}=\) average atomic number of the medium, and Z is given by \(Z^{2/3}=Z_{1}^{2/3}+Z_{2}^{2/3}\). A similar, but rather more complicated expression exists for the nuclear stopping power. The reader should especially note that the expression for energy loss depends highly upon the atomic number of both the recoil nucleus and the medium. The nuclear energy loss also depends upon the atomic number and mass of each. This means that for every possible recoil atom, we would have to generate a new curve, and then our computer program would have to select the proper one for each event. We would rather avoid this. Instead we adopt a system of unit-less variables (\(\rho,\ \epsilon\)) which is commonly used for these calculations. One advantage is that the expression for the electronic energy loss in such system becomes

\[\left(\frac{d\varepsilon}{d\rho}\right)_{el}=k\varepsilon^{1/2}.\]

where the proportional factor \(k\) is given by a expression:

\[k=\xi_{e}\cdot\frac{0793\ Z_{1}^{1/2}Z_{2}^{1/2}(A_{1}+A_{2})^{3/2}}{(Z_{1}^{2 /3}+Z_{2}^{2/3})^{3/4}A_{1}^{3/2}A_{2}^{1/2}}\]

We notice that the \(k\) varies extremely slowly with A and Z, that are in our range of atoms in the MDT gas, is virtually constant (\(k\sim 0.157\)). This leads us to the real convenience of the variable change. The conversions between the new variables and the old are given below:

\[\varepsilon=\frac{aA_{2}}{Z_{1}Z_{2}e^{2}(A_{1}+A_{2})}E_{R}\]

\[\rho=RNA_{2}\ \ 4\pi a^{2}\ \ \frac{A_{1}}{(A_{1}+A_{2})^{2}}\]

Where

\[a=(.8853)a_{0}\,(Z_{1}^{2/3}+Z_{2}^{2/3})^{-1/2}\]

The primary advantage of these variables is that all atom-specific information is now stored in the conversion to the unit-less variable, so we can compute one curve in these variables and apply it to all of our different types of recoil nuclei.

Because of the complicated expression for nuclear stopping power, actually generating the curve becomes a huge mathematical mess. The primary reason for this is that the parameter \(s\) in the nuclear stopping power, which is the exponent of the kinetic energy transfer in the differential cross section, changes values depending on which energy regime the recoil nucleus is in. This energy regime may change more than once as the energy decreases to 0, making it necessary to split the integral into several pieces. These pieces are often not analytically solvable, so depending on the energy regime, different approximations are necessary. Since all of this math has already been done by Lindhard et al, we find it less complicated to simply take the curves generated by Lindhard and use them. These curves have been experimentally verified by may different groups, and for several elements (see Figures 9 and 10).

Figure 9: Germanium data and Lindhard curves from reference [7].

Figure 11 is a picture of the curve, Ratio of ionization vs. the \(\varepsilon\), used in our simulation program.

The ENDF cross section data is interpolated with an accuracy of 2%. The MICAP program is fully analog in all parts of the code. Information about obtaining ENDF cross section data is included in the appendix of this note.

### Results of the Simulation

By combining the MICAP calculation of recoil energy of some gas nucleus with the theoretical curves taken from the Lindhard theory of stopping power, we are finally able to determine the amount of energy that has been lost due to electronic excitation and ionization of the the atoms in the gas. The reader should note that neutron collisions with the tube end-plug material have not been simulated accurately, but in our test configuration such collisions will be rare. The study of neutron interaction with the end plugs as a possible source of signal is something we would like to investigate and eventually include in our simulation.

First we present a histogram in Figure 12 of the frequency of events with each of the gas components, when \(10^{7}\) neutrons were simulated for the test.

Figure 13 shows the energy spectra for each of the elements, i.e. this is what the total spectrum would look like if the gas were made up of only that element. Note that the vertical scale is different for each graph.

Finally, our entire energy spectrum for the simulated MDT signal when irradiated with 0.5 MeV neutrons can be seen in Figure 14.

According to our model, the sensitivity of the MDT chamber to neutrons of 0.5 MeV is

\[\varepsilon_{MDT}=4.05\times 10^{-4}.\]

### Uncertainties of the Simulation Model

There are several factors which contribute to causing the simulation model to be inexact. The main contributing factors include the uncertainty in the cross sections in the MICAP calculations and the 5-10% error intrinsic to the Lindhard model. Also of importance are issues about the threshold used in the simulation when determining if a signal would be detectable in the MDT. There is also some error in our simulation due to inexact gas proportions.

The error in the MICAP model is a result of the fact that the cross section values used are interpolated from large groups of data, which don't always precisely coincide. The evaluated data used by the model are accurate to within 2% [4], so we shall use this value when totalling the errors of our simulation.

Figure 12: Histogram of Z distribution of recoil nuclei

Figure 13: Electronic signal spectra from each of the gas components

Figure 14: Simulated energy spectrum of the MDT.

The error in the Lindhard treatment of electronic energy loss is between 5-10%, as mentioned before [6]. The uncertainty in our model due to this intrinsic pulse height error is related to the signal threshold. A conservative estimate of the error in the signal rate is \(\sim\) 8%.

There is also an uncertainty due to the accuracy of the detector material description in the program. For example the gas proportions used in the simulation were not exactly the same as the real gas mixture used in the test. Typical errors for each gas component in the gas mixture is about 5% (relative error). This could also contribute to the signal efficiency uncertainty in the calculations. We estimate approximately 5% error in our result due to this difference.

Combining all of these sources of error, we find that the total percent error in calculating the efficiency with our model is approximately 9.6%. Therefore the final result of the simulated efficiency is given by

\[\varepsilon_{\mathit{MDT}}=(4.05\pm.40)\times 10^{-4}\]

## 4 Conclusion

The original purpose of this experiment was to further understand the effects of background neutron radiation on the Monitored Drift Tube detector. One of the two major components of the experiment was to use the Lowell neutron facility to experimentally determine the the sensitivity of the MDT chamber to a beam of primarily monochromatic neutrons, and to obtain the energy spectrum of the induced signal. The other major objective was to develop a simulation model whose results in the Lowell energy range were consistent with the experimental findings, and which could later be used to predict the sensitivity of the device to background neutron radiation of energies beyond the accelerator energies. We have succeeded in both endeavors.

In this note, we have presented some of the details involved in the creation of a signal in the MDT muon detection chamber by a neutron of specific energy. We have studied the theoretical mechanisms by which the signals are created when neutron radiation interacts with the detector material. Specifically we have examined the Lindhard model, and used its predictions along with the MICAP calculations to simulate the energy spectrum and the sensitivity of the MDT chamber. The results of the simulation agree well with both the experimental measurement made at Lowell and with a simple order of magnitude calculation. The sensitivity results are summarized here.

Order of magnitude calculation:

\[\varepsilon_{\mathit{MDT}}=4.02\times 10^{-4},\]Experimental result:

\[\varepsilon_{MDT}=(3.92\pm.39)\times 10^{-4},\]

Simulation model result:

\[\varepsilon_{MDT}=(4.05\pm.40)\times 10^{-4}.\]

**Appendix**

**Obtaining and Retrieving Neutron Cross Section Data**

All of the neutron cross section data used in this paper, as well as a plethora of data that was not used, can be obtained via an online database at Brookhaven National Laboratory. The procedure for doing this begins by obtaining an account with the National Nuclear Data Center (NNDC) 1. First, telnet to to the address bnlnd2.dne.bnl.gov. At the username type nndc. At the authorization code, type guest. At this point you can look around the database a bit to see what is available, but access to a lot of places will be denied. You should logout when you are finished exploring. At this point, the computer will ask if you wish to request an nndc account, to which you respond yes. Then answer a long series of self explanatory questions about yourself; the directions are quite good so follow them. In a few days, you should receive an e-mail notifying you that your account has been activated.

Footnote 1: see also the NNDC web site at: [http://www.nndc.bnl.gov/](http://www.nndc.bnl.gov/)

To obtain cross section data, telnet to the same account, and enter your new authorization code, and last name. You will be presented with a series of options, select data. More options will appear; to reach the data used in this paper select ENDF. At the next prompt type continue (or about if you wish to read further information). The ENDF option you should choose is DATA. At this point you should be prompted to enter a target atom. Enter first the atomic number followed by the atomic mass separated by a dash. At the projectile prompt select N (for neutron). Now you will be asked to choose a database. Many have the same information, but we found that the JENDL-3 (Japanese evaluated nuclear data file) to be the most complete. The next question asked is an option between basic data, and 300 degree Kelvin. This depends on what you are looking for, but our data was in the 300 category. Type RETRIEVE at the next prompt. Finally you are presented with a list of cross section options. you can scroll through the list using Forward or Backward, or End to get to the bottom of the list. To choose an option type c followed by whichever number you wish (for us usually 1 or 2). It may ask about what sort of cross section you want, we were usually interested in the angular distribution. Next it will ask for an energy range in MeV. This should be entered as a range with a dash between the lower and upper limits. Finally it will present you with the data. You can just cut and paste this into a file, else you could figure out how to get it sent to your account (very hard). Getting out of the database works exactly backward except one little glitch. At the energy range prompt you must simply press return if you wish to leave. All other options may be exited by exit, done, or quit.
