**1. Introduction**

Extensive Finite Element analyses were performed to determine the loads and stresses acting on the EB and Barrel during assembly and in its final configuration. Up to now it has been difficult to verify the FEA results due to the unusual compression at the inner radius shims has resulted in larger than anticipated deflections. The cryostat dummy load test offers the first real chance for a direct comparison between the deflections of the Tilecal and the FEA model. By comparing the difference in position of the FM's before the cryostat load was applied and afterwards it is possible to eliminate all other variables and compare directly with the FEA model.

This paper will present a comparison between the FEA model and the survey measurements for when the cryostat dummy weight load was applied at 32 modules and 46 modules in place.

A load of 80 tons was applied in the radial direction at the A-frame supports in the FEA model.

**2. FM locations**

The FM locations and numbering are described in detail in the two survey papers which recorded the measurements for these tests, EDMS #ATL-LB-UR-0039 and EDMS # ATL-LB-UR-0040

Figures 1 through 3 below also show the locations of the FM that were used in this comparison and the numbering used for the modules. It should be noted that not all of the FM could be measured because they were blocked by the supporting structure for the cryostat.

### Module FM Displacement

With 32 modules in place the FM on the modules moved only a small amount when the cryostat load was applied. The change in location of the module FM's in the X (horizontal) and Y (vertical) direction are plotted in Figures 4 and 5 below. The same module numbering as used in the survey is used in these figures. Included in these figures is the FEA results for this load condition.

**Deflection of Barrel**

The actual FM deflection appears to be caused by the rotation of the saddles inward rather than outward as expected. The survey measurements of the saddles were examined to check the deflection and rotation of the saddles. The survey deflections and the FEA results are shown n the table below.

The FM at the top and bottom of the saddles deflected considerably less than predicted by the FEA. These values of deflection were then used to calculate the change in angle of the saddles due to the application of the cryostat load. Based on the survey measurements the saddles rotated an average of.0065 degrees inward. The FEA model however, showed that the saddles rotated an average of.11 degrees outward.

The A-frames also showed little rotation in the survey. The table below lists the survey deflection of the A-frame FM and the predicted FEA deflections. The FEA predicted deflections are much larger than the actual measured deflections. The survey indicates that the A-frames rotated by an average of only.002 degrees while the FEA predicts that they rotate by.17 degrees.

A smaller rotation than predicted by the FEA could occur if the stiff dummy load frame acted to prevent this rotation and friction were present at the cryostat/A-frame interface. The FEA analysis which was done several years ago was based on a swivel and sliding connection with zero friction between the A-frame and the cryostat. In this case it was felt that the stiffness of the cryostat would not have an affect on the rotation of the saddles and the loading from the cryostat on the A-frame would be completely in the radial direction. In Figure 9 below the saddles and A-frame are shown schematically with a spring between the A-frames. The spring represents the stiffness of the cryostat/dummy load frame and the efficiency of the swivel connection between the A-frame and the cryostat. The FEA model assumed that the spring stiffness, K, was essentially zero and that there was a perfect sliding and rotational connection between the A-frame and the cryostat.

The force Fr shown in the figure above was applied in the FEA model. A frictional force in the tangential direction which is also applied to the A-frame. As long as there is a frictional force acting on the interface between the cryostat and the A-frame the force cannot be in the radial direction anymore.

The resultant in the vertical direction of Ft and Fr must always equal to the weight acting on the A-frame. This can be used to solve for Fr and the force in the X-direction.

\[\text{Fy}:=\frac{\text{Fr}}{\sqrt{2}}+\frac{\text{Ft}}{\sqrt{2}}\]

\[\text{Ft}:=\mu\cdot\text{Fr}^{\text{I\!\!I}}\]

\[\text{Fy}=\mu\cdot\frac{\text{Fr}}{\sqrt{2}}(1+\mu)\]

\[\text{Fy}=\mu\;\frac{\text{W}^{\text{I\!\!I}}}{2}\]

Substitute and solve for Fr

\[\text{Fr}:=\frac{\left(\text{W}\!\cdot\!\sqrt{2}\right)^{\text{I\!\!I}}}{2 \cdot\!\left(1+\mu\right)}\]

\[\text{Fx}:=\frac{\text{Fr}}{\sqrt{2}}+\frac{\text{Ft}}{\sqrt{2}}+\text{Fs}\]

Fs is the force from the platform stiffness

Substituting from above to solve for Fx

\[\text{Fx}=\mu\;\text{W}.\frac{\left(1-\mu\right)}{1+\mu}+\text{Fs}\]

As friction increases Fr decreases and Fx approaches zero. \(\text{Fy}\) will always equal W/2. Therefore, if friction was high enough then the force acting on the A-frame will be in the vertical direction alone.

In order to better understand the survey data two additional FEA models were run. In the first model the A-frame was only being loaded in the vertical direction. In the second model friction of.2 was used which resulted (from the equation above) in a force Fx being applied with was.6667*Fy. \(\text{In both}\) of these models the stiffness of the dummy weight platform was ignored. \(\text{The results are shown in}\) Figure 10 and 11 below.

Neither of these cases exactly matches the survey data, however, they are both very close. \(\text{What is}\) most surprising is the large affect on the deflection of small reductions in Fx. \(\text{In the initial model}\) Fx=Fy for a radial applied load and there were deflections on the order of 20mm. \(\text{By simply including}\) a friction coefficient of.2 which reduces Fx by a factor of.6667 the deflections reduced dramatically. It is clear that the initial model in which the coefficient of friction was zero was wrong. \(\text{A friction}\) force must be included in the analysis. \(\text{The results of the two additional FEA models with the coefficient of friction equal to.2 and 1.0 more closely match the survey data. \(\text{However, since neither}\) one exactly matches the data this indicates that the actual friction is somewhere between.2 and 1.0 or there is an additional affect that is caused by the stiffness of the cryostat platform.

## 5 Conclusion

This analysis shows that there is a good match between the survey data and the \(\mathrm{FEA}\) results for the case when the cryostat load was applied with 32 modules in place. However, this was most likely due to the fact that the deflections were very small, on the scale of.2-.4mm.

There was, however, a very large discrepancy between the initial FEA results and the survey data for the case in which the cryostat load is applied with 46 modules in place and no friction on the airpad. This initial model assumed that the force applied to the A-Frame was completely in the radial direction and ignored the effect of friction and the stiffness of the cryostat/platform.

Further analysis in which the affect of friction on the A-frame was included showed better correlation. Two models which including the affect of friction were examined. In the first the coefficient of friction was 1.0 which resulted in a completely vertical force on the airframe. This is an extreme case. In the second model the coefficient of friction was.2. Neither model correlated exactly with the survey data, however, both were very close and the order of magnitude was similar to the survey results. The results of the two additional \(\mathrm{FEA}\) models with the coefficient of friction equal to.2 and 1.0 more closely match the survey data than the initial model with no friction included. However, since neither one exactly matches the data this indicates that the actual friction is somewhere between.2 and 1.0 or there is an additional affect that is caused by the stiffness of the cryostat platform.

What is most surprising about these results is the strong affect that a small increase in friction has on the deflection of the Tilecal. In the initial model with a purely radial load (due to zero friction) applied to the A-frame the deflections were on the order of 20mm. However, the relatively small reduction (a factor of.667) in the horizontal force, \(\mathrm{Fx}\), on the A-frame due to friction equal of.2 resulted in a dramatic reduction of the deflections which were now on the order of 1mm. It is believed that this is caused by several affects. First, the vertical load on the A-frame is acting to rotate the saddles inward. The force \(\mathrm{Fx}\), however, acts to rotate the saddles outward. At the same time the center of gravity of the modules above the saddles is outside of the swivel point of the saddles, therefore, acting to rotate the saddles outward. It appears that with the friction equal to.2 or higher these forces acting to rotate the saddles are in balance and therefore the saddles do not rotate. As friction is reduced to a minimum of zero the force \(\mathrm{Fx}\) reaches a maximum. This causes an out of balance condition which results in relatively large rotations of the saddle. The weight of the modules below the saddle acts to counterbalance this rotation.

Initial additional static analysis has been done of the barrel assembly with the frictional force added and these indicate that the Barrel is stable when the cryostat load is applied at 32. The results of the static analysis are shown in Appendix 1 and there is not a significant change in the saddle forces.

Given the large variation in the deflection of the structure due to a very small change in the friction from zero to.2 it is preferred that the cryostat load transfer occur when 64 modules are in place. In this situation the deflection of the barrel during assembly are well understood and it becomes much easier to shim between modules in order to achieve the barrel envelope. By transferring the load from the cryostat at 64 modules this variable in the deflection of the structure is eliminated which makes the assembly process much easier.
