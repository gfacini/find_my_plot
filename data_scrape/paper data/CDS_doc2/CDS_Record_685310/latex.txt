Abstract

The excellent results obtained with the B0 prototype coil suggest that the final ATLAS toroidal magnet system may be operated at a current 10% higher than originally proposed. This note provides an evaluation of what would be the impact of the corresponding magnetic field upgrade on the physics performances of the Muon Spectrometer. It is shown that the gains in performances are such that it would allow to recover or even exceed the losses implied by the successive downscopings made to the magnet and detector systems.

The role of the B0 tests is mainly to verify the manufacturing concepts of the coil. That concerns essentially the mechanical aspect but also the thermal and electrical aspects. The information return will allow to bring possible modifications to the manufacturing of the final BT coils. As part of the validation of the ATLAS toroidal system concept, for which the nominal current is baselined at 20.5kA, the coil prototype tests have demonstrated that such a requirement is met with a ten percent safety margin by operating it at 22.5kA.

In view to further evaluate its response to increased current conditions, the coil prototype was successfully operated at 24kA, in both normal and reversed polarities. This major achievement suggests that the possibility to operate the ATLAS toroids with a typical 10% increase in current may be envisaged.

The possibility to operate the toroids at a current 10% higher than the baseline current must be explored in terms of its impact on physics performances. In the context of a Magnet System and a Detector System having gone through several downgrades (the design of the magnet is the result of numerous reductions in the magnet power to accomodate severe costs constraints, while the Muon Spectrometer layout has undergone sensitive losses in its overall acceptance), this possibility appears has a chance to recover part of the physics potential that was lost.

In the following sections, the impacts of a 10% increase of the Magnetic Field in the Muon Spectrometer on global performances, such as transverse momentum resolution on individual muons and resolution on invariant mass reconstruction in a few selected physics channels with different topologies, are investigated.

## 2 Impact on Single Muon Performances

The performances on single muon resolution are analyzed using the RESOMU algorithm embedded in the muon reconstruction package MUONBOX [1, 2]. For a given set of muon input parameters (\(\eta\), \(\phi\), \(p_{\tau}\), charge), this algorithm performs an analytical evaluation of the different contributions to momentum resolution, using an important set of subroutines of MUONBOX, such as the internal geometrical description and the continuous tracking in magnetic field. This method was used to describe the physics performance of the muon system in the ATLAS Muon Spectrometer Technical Design Report [3] and the ATLAS Detector and Physics Performance Technical Design Report [4].

The impact of the magnetic field upgrade is here determined at several regimes of muon transverse momentum (10, 30, 100, and 1000 GeV/c) where the different contributions to resolution interplay in different manners. The effects of the increased \(\int\!\!Bdl\) is best seen in a full \(\eta\)-scan of the detector at a fixed value of \(\phi\), which allows to display the behavior of momentum resolution versus the geometrical and field configurations. Such a scan is performed at \(\phi=\pi/8\), corresponding to the region with highest magnetic field in the Barrel Toroid (center of Small Chamber sector); the transverse momentum resolution is shown in Figure 1 for the baseline magnetic field, and for the new, upgraded field. The relative evolution between the two configurations is also shown.

At low transverse momentum (10 GeV/c) the evolution in resolution exibits two different behaviors. In the barrel region, resolution is dominated by energy loss fluctuations in the calorimeter, and as a result, the effect of the magnetic field increase is minimized, with a typical 1-2% improvement. In the EndCap region, the multiple scattering in the EC Toroid walls dominates the energy loss fluctuations. Consequently, the resolution improves with the bending power. This leads to an average 8% improvement of the resolution in a wide range of pseudo-rapidity. This effect is exacerbated in other \(\phi\)-regions, and specially at \(\phi=0\), for which the muons have to go through the entire EC coil.

As momentum increases, the improvement in bending power dominates more an more over the energy losses. At 30 GeV/c, resolution is improved by \(\sim\)7% in the Barrel and \(\sim\)9% in the EndCap.

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:3]

At 100 GeV/c, the effect saturates at 10% over the entire phase-space. This is true up to the highest transverse momentum regimes. Very localized peaks in the evolution of resolution are observed. This marginal effect is due to the fact that the trajectories of the muons are modified by the new field configuration, so that the muons may encounter somewhat different geometrical configurations (acceptance holes for instance).

The conclusion of this study of single muons performance is that the resolution is improved at all momentum regimes, with a maximum 10% improvement in the 100-1000 GeV/c range.

## 3 Impact on Physics Channels

The impact of the Magnetic Field upgrade is examined in terms of performances on Physics Channels measurements (Invariant Mass reconstruction).

With respect to the Physics TDR studies [4], physics performances are affected by the increasing number and dimensions of service holes made necessary by realistic evaluations of the amount of cables and cryogenics feedthrough directed toward the inner regions of ATLAS. Access holes have also to be taken into account for maintenance during machine shutdowns. The most important losses in acceptance are situated in the central region [5]. Preliminary studies have shown that the physics performances would be seriously degraded by the so-called Central Crack [6].

The layout corresponding to the Physics TDR studies ("Layout M") has thus evolved to a more realistic layout ("Layout P"), made necessary by service, access and installation constraints. Layout P takes into account the most important proposed modifications : the central crack, the elevator holes for access between the feet, the service passage to ID through BIL, the new EE and EI geometries, and the displacement of the EM MDT and TGC chambers.

In this section, we show how the performances are downgraded by the Layout changes and how they are improved with the new proposed field configuration.

The performances on physics channels are here determined with a toy-model of event reconstruction in the muon spectrometer, whereby each individual muon of a Monte Carlo-generated event has its momentum smeared by a value of the resolution computed by RESOMU. Using the smeared momenta, events characteristics, such as the invariant mass, are then extracted. This method allows to bypass the use of the complete, time-consuming, evaluation through the MUONBOX full reconstruction sequence. The sample of events were generated with PYTHIA version 5.720 [7]. For each channel considered, samples of 10000 events are utilized, with the requirement that the entire set of muons has its rapidity below 2.7, which corresponds to the actual muon spectrometer coverage. For each muon with transverse momentum \(p_{\tau}\), the resolution is computed and used to smear \(1/p_{\tau}\), while no error is assumed on the \(\eta\) and \(\phi\) variables. Effect of trigger inefficiencies are taken into account, by placing the requirement that one muon triggers the system, for an event to be accepted in the analysis (the track has to satisfy the geometrical conditions of the Level-1 trigger).

In the following are presented the results thus obtained on the following channels : Standard Model Higgs to four muons, MSSM Neutral Higgs to two muons, Z' to two muons, and W' to a muon and a neutrino.

In Figure 2 is shown the resolution obtained in the invariant mass reconstruction for the H\(\,\rightarrow\,4\mu\) channel, for a Higgs rest mass of 180 GeV. Plots showing the difference between the reconstructed and the generated invariant mass are shown for three different configurations : Layout M + Old Field, Layout P + Old Field, and Layout P + New Field. This shows how the mass resolution was degraded when moving from Layout M to Layout P, and how this can be recovered with the new field. The increased field allows to improve the \(\sigma\) of the distribution by 7%. Thanks to this new Magnetic Field configuration, the resolution is better with Layout P than what it was orginally with Layout M. Figure 2 shows also the acceptance versus mass resolution curves. The evolution from Layout M to P has led to a dramatic loss of acceptance reaching \(\simeq\) 10%. The effect of the New Field is to shift left the acceptance curves. What is important is the fraction of the Higgs sample reconstructed with resolution less than, say, 2-3% (Best quality sample). In this respect, the New Field thus allows to improve the acceptance by nearly 10%. It appears also that much of what was lost when moving from Layout M to Layout P is recovered.

Similar plots are presented in Figure 3 for the A/H\(\rightarrow\) 2\(\mu\) channel, for a rest mass of 300 GeV. The mass resolution is improved by 7.6%. It appears that, considering the best-quality sample, the loss from the geometry downscoping is completely recovered by the New Field. Similar conclusions pertain for the Z'\(\rightarrow\) 2\(\mu\) channel (1 TeV).

Finally, in Figure 5 is shown the resolution obtained on the muon transverse momentum for the W'\(\rightarrow\mu\nu\) channel, for a rest mass of 1 TeV. The resolution is improved relatively by 5.3%. The acceptance curves show that the effect of Magnetic Field upgrade allow to exceed what was lost when moving from Layout M to Layout P.

Conclusions

The study of single muon performance shows that thanks to the proposed Magnetic Field upgrade, the resolution is improved at all momentum regimes, with a maximum 10% improvement in the 100-1000 GeV/c range.

The study of the impact on Physics Channels performances show that the increased magnetic field allows to recover or exceed, in terms of Mass Resolution, what was lost because of service and access holes. A typical 7% improvement in Mass Resolution is achieved. This reaches 10% for the best-quality samples.
