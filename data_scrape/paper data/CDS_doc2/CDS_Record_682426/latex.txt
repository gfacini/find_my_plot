A variety of interesting physics processes at the LHC, such as \(\PH\to\bbbar\) decays in the intermediate mass range [1], top and B physics, require efficient identification of \(b\)-quarks [2]. Preliminary studies [3] have shown, optimistically, that by tagging the \(b\)-decay vertex in the ATLAS inner detector through impact parameter cuts, a rejection factor of 100 (50) against light-quark jets may be achieved at low (high) luminosity for a \(b\)-jet efficiency of 70% (50%).

An independent method, which can enhance the \(b\)-tagging performance, consists in detecting electrons produced in \(b\) decays (through direct and cascade decays) by using the electromagnetic (EM) calorimeter and the preshower combined with the inner detector. Since these electrons are non-isolated and soft (\(p_{T}\) as low as 1-2 GeV), excellent electron/hadron separation capability in the calorimeter and preshower is required.

This note discusses the \(b\)-tagging performance of the ATLAS electromagnetic calorimeter and preshower, based on studies done with full simulation at \(\eta\simeq 0\).

Two layouts for the calorimeter-preshower system have been considered: a model with a separate preshower detector in front of the Accordion, as proposed in the Letter of Intent [4], and a model in which the preshower is integrated in the first sampling of the calorimeter, which has been chosen as baseline option for the Technical Proposal ("TP model"). In the latter case, the first compartment of the EM calorimeter, which is segmented in strips a few millimetres wide, acts as a preshower device. In the simulation described here, the strips in the first sampling measure the \(\eta\) direction only (\(\eta\)-strips 1). The main purpose of this study was to compare the soft-electron tag capability of these two layouts.

Footnote 1: A geometry with strips sensitive to two views (\(U\)\(V\)-strips) is also a considered solution.

This note is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the detector layouts and Section 3 the main features of the simulation. The analysis for \(e/h\) separation and the results are discussed in Sections 4 and 5 respectively. Finally Section 6 is devoted to conclusions and plans for future work.

## 2 Detector models

The separate and integrated preshower options have been already described in [5]. Therefore only the most relevant aspects will be recalled here.

The separate preshower is located in front of the EM calorimeter, inside the same cryostat. It consists of two LAr active layers interleaved with passive material. For most of the rapidity coverage, there is a total of 2 \(X_{0}\) (3 \(X_{0}\)) in front of the first (second) layer, including the material in the inner detector, the cryostat and the coil. The first active layer measures the \(\phi\)-coordinate and is equipped with strips of size \(\Delta\eta\times\Delta\phi\simeq 0.1\times 0.003\). The second layer measures the \(\eta\)-coordinate and has a granularity \(\Delta\eta\times\Delta\phi\simeq 0.003\times 0.1\).

In the integrated preshower model, strips projective in \(\eta\) and of size \(\Delta\eta=\)0.025/8 are etched on each electrode board in the first compartment of the calorimeter. Sixteen consecutive electrodes are grouped together in \(\phi\) in the same readout channel, leading to a readout granularity of \(\Delta\eta\times\Delta\phi\simeq 0.003\times 0.1\).

In the case of the separate preshower, the first and second longitudinal compartments of the EM calorimeter have a granularity of \(\Delta\eta\times\Delta\phi\simeq 0.025\times 0.025\) and the third compartment \(\Delta\eta\times\Delta\phi\simeq 0.025\times 0.05\). In the integrated preshower model, the first compartment has the strip segmentation described above, while the last two compartments have the same granularities as in the separate preshower case.

## 3 Event samples

The \(b\)-tagging efficiency and the jet background rejection were studied with two event samples. The signal sample consisted of about 100 \(\mathrm{H}\to\mathrm{b}\overline{\mathrm{b}}\) events with \(m_{H}~{}=~{}80\) GeV, where one of the two \(b\) quarks was forced to decay to electron. The following pre-selections were applied at particle level:

* both \(b\)'s with \(p_{T}>15\) GeV.
* both \(b\)'s in the rapidity range \(|\eta|<\)0.3.
* the electron with \(p_{T}\geq 2\) GeV and within the rapidity region \(|\eta|<\)0.6.

The \(b\to e\) "branching ratio" was found to be 13% (including cascade decays) for \(p_{T}^{e}\geq 2\) GeV, using PYTHIA 5.7 with modified settings for the \(b\)-quark fragmentation (Ref. [6] with \(\epsilon_{b}=-0.006\), \(\epsilon_{e}=-0.07\)).

The background sample consisted of about 200 \(H\to gg\) events with \(m_{H}~{}=~{}80\) GeV, selected at particle level with the following cuts:

* both gluons with \(p_{T}>15\) GeV.
* both gluons within the rapidity range \(|\eta|<\)0.3.

The motivation for generating the same kind of process for the signal and background sample was to have the same \(p_{T}\)-spectra for the \(b\) and gluon jets.

The generated events were processed through full GEANT simulation of the ATLAS detector, which included the inner tracker ("panel" layout), the preshower and all details of the Accordion geometry. The material distribution in the inner detector was correctly described. However, for this first study the pattern recognition of the tracker was not used and the information on the charged tracks was obtained from the particle bank (KINE). In the calorimeter and preshower, on the other hand, a full reconstruction of the particle energies was performed.

Since low-\(p_{T}\) electrons are very sensitive to electronic noise, the energies deposited in the calorimeter cells and in the preshower strips were suitably smeared according to the expected noise contributions. The noise values (\(\sigma\)) at \(\eta=0\) are listed in the above Table.

At larger rapidity these values were scaled as \(1/\sin\,\theta\), where \(\theta\) is the cell or strip polar angle with respect to the beam axis.

The pile-up noise was not included, since \(b\)-tagging is mostly needed for physics issues which will be studied at the LHC during the first years of data taking at low luminosity.

## 4 Description of the analysis

The transverse momentum distribution for electrons from \(b\) decays and for charged hadrons from gluon hadronization is shown in Fig. 1 for events surviving the particle level selections described above. The electron spectrum is harder than the charged hadron spectrum, but nevertheless about 50% of the electrons have \(p_{T}<5\) GeV. At such low energies, non-isolated electron reconstruction in the calorimeter by searching blindly for electromagnetic showers over the full angular coverage is not efficient. Instead, all charged tracks with \(p_{T}\geq 2\) GeV were extrapolated to the calorimeter front face, taking into account the bending of the magnetic field in the transverse plane. Since most of the electrons from \(b\) decays are soft and non-isolated, the shower was reconstructed over a small area centred on the extrapolated track position. This "core" area was defined as three calorimeter cells, the hit cell plus the adjacent cells in \(\eta\) and \(\phi\) with the highest energy depositions. The energy in the preshower, or in the first sampling of the EM calorimeter in the case of the TP model, was included by adding the signal in all the strips overlapping a given core cell. The energy contained in each of these strips was divided by four to take into account that in one direction (\(\eta\) in the first layer of the separate preshower and in the first calorimeter compartment for the TP model, \(\phi\) in the second layer of the separate preshower) the strips extend over a region of about four calorimeter cells. The distribution of the energy in the core, which was required to be larger than 500 MeV, is plotted in Fig. 2 for electrons from \(b\)-jets and charged hadrons from gluon jets. The core contains about 60% of the original particle energy in the case of electrons (see Fig. 3), with tails due to bremsstrahlung in the inner detector, and much less in the case of charged hadrons.

The following variables were then used to separate electrons from charged hadrons:* longitudinal shower shape. The fraction of energy deposited in the third compartment of the EM calorimeter is larger for hadrons than for electrons, as shown in Fig. 4. Events in which this fraction was less than 15% were classified as electrons. This cut has an efficiency of about 90% for electrons and allows for a rejection of four against charged hadrons from gluon jets.
* energy in preshower. The signal observed in the preshower detector, or in the first sampling of the EM calorimeter in the case of the TP model, is larger for electrons than for hadrons because electron-showers start earlier. Figure 5 shows the energy deposited in the three strips of the first calorimeter sampling (TP model) centred on the extrapolated impact point of the track. Requiring more than a total of 4 mips over the three strips retains 97% of the electrons and 44% of the hadrons, after the longitudinal shape cut.
* track-calorimeter matching. The ratio between the shower energy reconstructed in the calorimeter and the momentum of the associated track in the inner detector is expected to be close to unity in the case of electrons and more broadly distributed for charged hadrons. Two possible clusters were considered in the calorimeter: the shower core defined above, and a cluster of \(3\times 7\) cells in \(\eta\times\phi\). The cluster energy, between these two possibilities, which best matches the track momentum was used. The resulting distribution is shown in Fig. 6 for electrons and hadrons passing the selections described above. Requiring \(0.5<E/p<1.5\) rejects about 15% of the surviving electrons and 60% of the residual hadrons. Although the track momentum considered here was not obtained from a reconstruction in the inner detector, previous studies [2] have shown that this very loose cut is fairly safe, although bremsstrahlung effects will have to be studied carefully.

In the case of electrons, the shower position reconstructed in the calorimeter must concide, within the measurement accuracies, with the track impact point extrapolated to the calorimeter front face. In the \(\phi\) direction this requirement is weakened by several factors. First of all, electron bremsstrahlung in the inner detector spoils the matching between the track and the shower position in the calorimeter. Furthermore, in the case of the integrated preshower the \(\phi\) granularity in the first sampling, where most of the shower energy is contained at low \(p_{T}\), is too coarse, while in the separate preshower, which has in principle two fine-grained views, the energy deposited in the \(\phi\)-layer, which is located behind only 2 \(X_{0}\), is subject to large fluctuations in the case of soft electrons. These problems do not affect the \(\eta\) direction, where a cut on the matching between the shower position in the calorimeter and the track impact point allows for a further rejection of about 1.8 against charged hadrons after the \(E/p\)-match cut.

These two cuts, energy and position matching, are strongly correlated. They are useful to reject overlaps of \(\pi^{0}\)'s with charged hadron tracks.

* shower shape in the calorimeter and preshower. The ratio between the energy contained in the core and the energy in a \(3\times 7\) cell cluster in the calorimeter is shown in Fig. 7 for electrons and hadrons surviving the previous selections. Because of the narrower electromagnetic showers, the distribution for electrons peaks at larger values than the one for hadrons. In both preshower layouts, the shower profile was defined as the energy in two strips (the strip hit by the extrapolated track and the adjacent strip with the highest energy) divided by the energy in \(\pm 8\) strips around the hit strip. Because of electron bremsstrahlung in the inner detector, a more efficient separation is achieved in the \(\eta\) view (see Fig. 8). Requiring \(E_{\rm core}/E_{3\times 7}>0.48\) and a profile larger than 0.4 in \(\eta\) allows to keep about 70% of the electrons selected with the previous cuts and to reject about 95% of the residual hadrons.

## 5 Results

The results obtained with the analysis described above are summarized in Fig. 9, which shows the rejection against charged hadrons, achieved in the various steps of the analysis, as a function of the electron identification efficiency. For an electron efficiency of 75% (50%) the hadron rejection is about 50 (700). Without electronic noise, this rejection would increase by about 5% for the same electron efficiency. The hadron rejection is also shown in Fig. 10 as a function of the \(b\to e\) tagging efficiency. Figure 10 was obtained from Fig. 9 by multiplying the electron identification efficiency by 13%, which is the probability that a \(b\) quark produces an electron of \(p_{T}\geq 2\) GeV.

It can be seen that the separate and the integrated preshower give very similar results. One might have naively expected a worse performance in the case of the TP layout, because the long \(\eta\) strips in the first compartment, which extend over \(\Delta\phi\simeq\)0.1, can spoil identification criteria based on isolation and \(\phi\)-position measurement. In the separate preshower model, on the other hand, the first LAr layer has a fine granularity in \(\phi\) and the calorimeter behind has full granularity in the three compartments. However, as already mentioned, electron bremsstrahlung in the inner detector significantly reduces the importance of the \(\phi\)-view. Furthermore, the particle multiplicity in the vicinity of the electron track is rather small. There are on average two (one) charged tracks with \(p_{T}\geq 2\) GeV at a distance \(\Delta R\leq 0.25\) from the electron direction before (after) the selection cuts. In other words, electrons from \(b\) decays can be considered as semi-isolated.

The rejection obtained against gluon jets is shown in Fig. 11 as a function of the \(b\)-tagging efficiency. The average charged track multiplicity in the gluon jets for tracks with \(p_{T}\geq 2\) GeV is about five 2, therefore an efficiency of 10% (6.5%) for \(b\)-jets allows for a rejection of 10 (150) against gluons. A significant improvement in this performance is expected from adding the (independent) TRT information for \(e/h\) identification [7].

Figure 12 shows the \(p_{T}\) spectrum for electrons and charged hadrons at various steps of the analysis. It can be seen that only one hadron survives all selection cuts and that this hadron has a relatively large transverse momentum. It is a \(\pi^{-}\) of \(p_{T}\simeq 32\) GeV producing, via charge exchange, a \(\pi^{0}\) which barely passes the various cuts in the calorimeter.

The top part of Fig. 12 shows that efficiency of the cuts, which were not tuned nor optimized as a function of \(p_{T}\), increases with the electron transverse momentum. This can also be observed in Fig. 13, which shows the fraction of electrons surviving all the selections described in Section 4 as a function of \(p_{T}\). Efficiencies of about 80% are reached for \(p_{T}\geq 12\) GeV, while for \(p_{T}\simeq 7\) GeV, i.e. the average transverse momentum for electrons from \(b\) decays considered here, the efficiency is \(\sim\)60%. It is hoped that a better optimization of cuts versus \(p_{T}\) and a proper combination of calorimeter/preshower and TRT will provide the means to achieve similar efficiencies down to \(p_{T}\simeq 1\) GeV.

Finally the background from real electrons inside gluon jets has also been evaluated. In the initial sample of about 200 \(H\to gg\) events, there are in total 490 electrons, corresponding to an average of one electron per gluon jet. Those surviving the various selection steps of the analysis are listed in the Table below.

\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|} \hline Selection steps & Number of accepted electrons & Efficiency \\ \hline Initial sample & 490 & 100\% \\ \(p_{T}\geq 2\) GeV & 16 & 3.3\% \\ Longitudinal shape & 12 & 2.4\% \\ Preshower signal & 11 & 2.2\% \\ \(E/p\) and position matching & 6 & 1.2\% \\ Lateral shower shape & 1 & 0.2\% \\ \hline \end{tabular}

Most of the electrons passing the \(p_{T}\) cut come from \(\pi^{0}\rightarrow\gamma e^{+}e^{-}\) Dalitz decays, while the one surviving all selections is produced in the decay of a charmed meson.

By comparing the above Table with Fig. 9, one can deduce that for an efficiency of 50% (75%) for electrons from \(b\) decays, the rejection against genuine electrons from gluon jets is 500 (80).

## 6 Conclusions

In this note we have described a first study of the \(b\)-tagging capability of the ATLAS electromagnetic calorimeter and preshower. The results indicate that the calorimeter is able to identify semi-isolated soft electrons down to \(p_{T}\simeq 2\) GeV. In particular rejections of 50 (700) against charged hadrons and of 10 (150) against gluon jets were obtained for an overall \(b\)-tagging efficiency of 10% (6.5%), which corresponds to an electron identification efficiency of 75% (50%).

This performance is similar for the separate preshower layout and the TP model. It can be almost entirely attributed to the good lateral and longitudinal segmentation of the EM calorimeter and preshower, while other features, like the good energy resolution of the Accordion, contribute very little to this particle identification issue.

The preliminary study presented here will be pursued with the aim of including the full tracker reconstruction and the TRT information for \(e/h\) separation, and of extending the analysis to the full rapidity coverage \(|\eta|<2.5\) and down to \(p_{T}\ \simeq\ 1\) GeV.
