###### Abstract:

Standard Model Higgs production in association with \(Z\) or \(W\) gauge bosons, or with \(t\bar{t}\) obtains a substantial contribution from events with large missing transverse energy. It is found that the decay channel \(h\to\gamma\gamma\) has a significant discovery potential, with large signal to background ratio, when missing transverse energy of \(\sim 66\) GeV is required. Very good reconstruction of \(\not\!\!E_{T}\) is required, however. A measurement of the rate of this channel should be useful in determining the strength of the Higgs coupling to gauge bosons.

## 1 Introduction

For consistency with precision electroweak measurements, it is expected that, if a Standard Model (SM) Higgs exists, its mass will be not much higher than the present lower limit of 114.4 GeV, obtained from direct LEP searches [1]. Although it has been demonstrated that the LHC will be able to detect a Higgs in this mass range [2], it is important to ensure that it will be observed in as many channels as possible for confirmation, and so that its couplings to gauge bosons and the Yukawa couplings to fermions are checked for consistency with SM predictions.

Here we report on a search for a Higgs in the mass range \(115-150\) GeV decaying in the channel \(h\to\gamma\gamma\) produced in association with missing energy. In particular, we consider the production channels: \(gg\to h\), \(qq^{\prime}\to qq^{\prime}h\), \(q\bar{q}\to Zh,\ {\rm or}\ Wh\), and \(gg\to t\bar{t}h\). The \(h\to\gamma\gamma\) channel has previously been studied [2] in direct production, in association with gauge bosons decaying to leptons, and in association with jets. A statistically significant signal is expected for masses 110-140 GeV, for an integrated luminosity of 100 fb\({}^{-1}\). The signal to background ratio in the direct production channel is low, however, and very dependent on the rate of irreducible \(\gamma\gamma\) background, where radiative corrections can be significant, as well as on the reducible \(\gamma\)+jet and di-jet backgrounds, where the \(\gamma\)-jet discrimination is of crucial importance. By selecting a production channel where large missing transverse energy is present, the signal to background ratio can be very significantly improved, in spite of the reduced production cross section, if systematic errors on the measurement of missing transverse energy can be controlled.

The note is organized as follows. The next section describes the phenomenological aspects of the analysis and gives details on the Monte Carlo simulation procedures for signals and backgrounds. Section 3 then then presents the results. In the conclusion, we give a summary and comment on the measurement of the Higgs couplings to gauge bosons.

## 2 Phenomenology

We describe here the different signals leading to Higgs boson production in association with missing energy, and the SM backgrounds.

### Higgs production in association with missing energy

Table 1 lists various Higgs boson production processes accompanied by missing energy. It gives the leading-order cross section, and accounts for the branching ratio BR(\(h\to\gamma\gamma\) as a function of the Higgs mass. The values were obtained using the generator PYTHIA 6.2 [3], which was used for producing samples for the analysis below. Initial and final state radiation were included. The CTEQ5L [4] parton distribution function was used.

### Standard Model Backgrounds

Following [2], we consider first the main backgrounds to the process \(pp\to h\to\gamma\gamma\), which come in two types: (i) first, there is an irreducible background consisting of genuine photon pairs produced by the Born process (\(q\bar{q}\to\gamma\gamma\)), by the box diagram process (\(gg\to\gamma\gamma\)) and by quark bremsstrahlung (\(qg\to q\gamma\to q\gamma\gamma\)); (ii) second, there is also the reducible backgrounds -- consisting of QCD jet-jet or \(\gamma\)-jet events -- in which one or both jets are misidentified as photons [2]. These two sources of background are comparable in size, even though the reducible backgrounds have

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|} \hline Process & 100 & 110 & 120 & 130 & 140 & 150 \\ \hline \(gg\to h\) & 22600 & 19900 & 17200 & 15400 & 13200 & 11400 \\ \(qq\to qqh\) & 4880 & 4680 & 4090 & 3900 & 3700 & 3380 \\ \(q\bar{q}^{\prime}\to Wh;\ \ W\to e,\mu,\tau+\nu\) & 705 & 526 & 368 & 227 & 138 & 77 \\ \(q\bar{q}\to Zh;\ \ Z\to\nu\bar{\nu}\) & 247 & 184 & 141 & 106 & 84 & 64 \\ \(q\bar{q}\to Zh;\ \ Z\to\tau\bar{\tau}\) & 41 & 31 & 23 & 17 & 14 & 11 \\ \(qq+gg\to t\bar{t}h\) & 91 & 67 & 52 & 41 & 32 & 26 \\ \hline \hline \(10^{3}\times BR(h\to\gamma\gamma)\) & 2.07 & 2.55 & 2.88 & 2.85 & 2.41 & 1.68 \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 1: Cross sections (fb) for processes of SM Higgs production in association with missing energy for different Higgs masses. The \(BR(h\to\gamma\gamma)\) is given in the last line huge cross-sections compared to the irreducible ones. This is because there are compensating large rejection factors thanks to the efficient photon/jet discrimination which is expected for ATLAS. These rejection factors have been evaluated to be \(2\times 10^{7}\) or \(8\times 10^{3}\) respectively, for jet-jet and \(\gamma\)-jet backgrounds. Once this rejection efficiency is included, the reducible background events number about 20% of the expected number of irreducible background events.

To the above backgrounds, we add processes with two photons as well as neutrinos in the final state. In particular, we consider the processes (i) \(Z\gamma\gamma,\;Z\rightarrow\nu\bar{\nu}\) or \(Z\rightarrow\tau\tau\), (ii) \(W\gamma\gamma,\;W\rightarrow\ell\nu\), with \(\ell=e,\mu\) or \(\tau\) and (iii) \(t\bar{t}\gamma\gamma\). These processes were generated with CompHep [5], applying cuts: \(m_{\gamma\gamma}>50\) GeV and \(p_{T}(\gamma)>10\) GeV. Hadronization, as well as initial and final state QCD and QED radiation were then performed with PYTHIA. For cross-check, we also generated the processes of \(Z\gamma\) and \(W\gamma\) production using PYTHIA. The second \(\gamma\) is expected to be emitted from initial or final state radiation. A \(p_{T}\) cut of 35 GeV was applied in these cases.

Table 2 gives the cross sections of all reducible and irreducible background processes. Following ref. [2], we will incorporate the quark bremsstrahlung process into the simulation by scaling the two other irreducible backgrounds by 50% of the combined Born plus box contribution, after having applied isolation cuts, as described below.

We will not consider QCD background with accompanying genuine high energy photons as the cross section should be suppressed by \(\alpha^{2}\) and therefore will not be more significant than the reducible background considered above. There are certainly many other background processes with neutrinos in the final state, where photons can be produced in initial or final state radiation, but their cross sections will be relatively low, or they will be easily rejected by cutting events with a large hadronic activity. The process \(t\bar{t}\gamma\gamma\), for example, will produce events with missing energy, but contribute negligibly to the backgrounds (see Table 2, and they could be suppressed, in any case, by b-jet and central jet vetos.

### Analysis

Monte Carlo samples of the above signals and backgrounds have been obtained using the generators PYTHIA [3] and CompHep [5], as described above. The detector acceptance and resolution effects were simulated using ATLFAST [6], a program which uses parametrized distributions for different parts of the ATLAS detector.

We choose a set of cuts which can be used to isolate those \(pp\rightarrow\gamma\gamma\) events which also involve significant amounts of missing energy. We first establish our criteria for identifying two isolated photons, following [2]. In the ATLAS detector photons are detected if they are emitted with pseudorapidity in the range \(|\eta|<2.5\). We consider such photons to be isolated if their transverse momentum satisfies \(P_{T}^{\gamma}>5.0\) GeV, and if there is less than 10 GeV of energy deposited by all other particles within a cone of radius \(\Delta R=\sqrt{(\Delta\phi)^{2}+(\Delta\eta)^{2}}<0.4\) around the photon of interest.

When normalizing the Monte Carlo samples, an efficiency factor of 80% per photon is applied.

As discussed above, part of the reducible background consists of jets which are misidentified as photons, and so we need also define our criteria for jet reconstruction. For this we use the cone algorithm, with a cone radius of \(\Delta R=0.4\), a pseudorapidity coverage of 5.0 and a minimal jet energy threshold of 10 GeV.

The first cuts to be imposed are those which optimize the significance of the direct \(h\to\gamma\gamma\) signal for the standard Higgs search at ATLAS [2]. To this end we require:

**Cut 1:** The two photon candidates, ordered in \(p_{T}\), must have transverse momenta which are in excess of 40 and 25 GeV. (That is, we choose \(P_{T}=40\) GeV for photon 1 and \(P_{T}=25\) GeV for photon 2.)
**Cut 2:** Both photon candidates must lie in the pseudorapidity interval \(|\eta|<2.4\) and have a pseudorapidity separation of at least 0.15 (\(\Delta\eta>0.15\));
**Cut 3:** The reconstructed mass of the two photons, the two jets, or the jet + \(\gamma\) final state must have an invariant mass which is sufficiently close

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|} \hline Processes & cross-section (pb) \\ \hline \hline \(pp\to\gamma\gamma\) (Born) & 56.2 \\ \hline \(pp\to\gamma\gamma\) (box) & 49.0 \\ \hline \(pp\to\)jet+jet & \(4.9\times 10^{8}\) \\ \hline \(pp\to\)jet+\(\gamma\) & \(1.2\times 10^{5}\) \\ \hline \(pp\to Z\gamma\); \(Z\to\nu\bar{\nu}\) & 3.3 \\ \(p_{T}>35\) GeV (PYTHIA) & \\ \hline \(pp\to Z\gamma\); \(Z\to\tau\bar{\tau}\) & 0.66 \\ \(p_{T}>35\) GeV (PYTHIA) & \\ \hline \(pp\to W\gamma\); \(W\to\ell\nu\) & 5.6 \\ \(p_{T}>35\) GeV (PYTHIA) & \\ \hline \(pp\to Z\gamma\gamma\); \(Z\to\nu\bar{\nu}\) & 0.0325 \\ \(m_{\gamma\gamma}>50\) GeV, \(p_{T}(\gamma)>10\) GeV (CompHep) & \\ \hline \(pp\to Z\gamma\gamma\); \(Z\to\tau\tau\) & 0.0055 \\ \(m_{\gamma\gamma}>50\) GeV, \(p_{T}(\gamma)>10\) GeV (CompHep) & \\ \hline \(pp\to W\gamma\gamma\); \(W\to\ell\nu\) & 0.0375 \\ \(m_{\gamma\gamma}>50\) GeV, \(p_{T}(\gamma)>10\) GeV (CompHep) & \\ \hline \(pp\to t\bar{t}\gamma\gamma\) & 0.0147 \\ \(m_{\gamma\gamma}>50\) GeV, \(p_{T}(\gamma)>10\) GeV (CompHep) & \\ \hline \end{tabular}

to the Higgs mass. Quantitatively, we demand: \(M_{h}-1.4\sigma_{h}<M_{\gamma\gamma}<M_{h}+1.4\sigma_{h}\), where \(\sigma_{h}\) is the \(h\to\gamma\gamma\) resolution is as given in [2].

At this stage, after imposing these cuts, assuming an integrated luminosity of 100 fb\({}^{-1}\), and a 80% efficiency for detecting each photon, we are left with a total of 1570 signal events (for \(m_{h}=120\) GeV) and 44510 background events. The results resemble those of direct Higgs boson production, as described in ref. [2], but the number of signal events is somewhat higher (1190 in [2]) because we have used a BR(\(h\to\gamma\gamma\)) \(=2.88\times 10^{-3}\), as calculated by PYTHIA6.2, compared to \(2.19\times 10^{-3}\) in [2].

The missing energy distributions for the signals and backgrounds are displayed in Fig. 1. A mass window of \(\pm 1.4\) times the \(m_{\gamma\gamma}\) resolution, as given in [2] has been applied around a test case resonance of 120 GeV. As the figure shows, events from Born and box diagrams of \(\gamma\gamma\) production, as well as from QCD diagrams, with misreconstructed jets have generally \(\not\!\!E_{T}\)\(\;\hbox to 0.0pt{\lower 2.5pt\hbox{$\sim$}}\raise 1.5pt\hbox{$<$}\;\)50 GeV. The high energy tail in the background \(\not\!\!E_{T}\) distribution is due principally to the processes \(Z\gamma\gamma\) and \(W\gamma\gamma\).

Fig. 2, shows the number of events of the different signals and backgrounds as a function of a minimum \(\not\!\!E_{T}\) cut applied, for the sample case of a Higgs of mass 120 GeV and for an integrated luminosity of 100 fb\({}^{-1}\). As the cut is raised, the number of signal events from direct production falls rapidly, but so do the backgrounds from direct di-photon production and from misidentified QCD processes. On the other hand, events from associated production, as well as background events from \(Z\gamma\gamma\) and \(W\gamma\gamma\) survive the cut in larger proportion and eventually dominate. With a cut \(\not\!\!E_{T}>\) 55 GeV, the signal to background ration becomes higher than unity.

In Fig. 3, we show the signal significance (\(S/\sqrt{B}\)), for the same case of a Higgs of mass 120 GeV and for an integrated luminosity of 100 fb\({}^{-1}\). As expected, after an initial fall, it rises again as the \(\not\!\!E_{T}\) cut is raised and reaches a maximum for \(\not\!\!E_{T}>\) 66 GeV. Based on these considerations, we choose to apply the missing-energy cut:

**Cut 4:** The missing transverse energy of the entire event must satisfy:

\(\not\!\!E_{T}>66\) GeV.

Results for the Higgs mass range \(100-150\) GeV are given in Table 3, where the contributions of the different components of signals are explicitely presented, as well as the total background level, for 100 fb\({}^{-1}\). The significance of the signal is shown both as \(S/\sqrt{B}\) and as a Poisson significance representing the Gaussian-equivalent number of standard deviations of the signal. The resulting signal for \(m_{h}=120\) GeV, consists of 20.9 events (of which 1.2 events are from direct h production). It is shown in Fig. 4 together with the total background of 5.4 events in that same window. The signal survives if a lepton veto is applied (thus rejecting the \(Wh\) events), since 11 events would remain on a background of 3.5. As a check, if the \(Z\gamma\) and \(W\gamma\) events produced with PYTHIA are used instead of the \(Z\gamma\gamma\) and \(W\gamma\gamma\) events from CompHep, the background level is found to be approximately 50% lower.

## 3 Discussion and Conclusion

The analysis above shows that, although the number of events is small, a significant SM Higgs signal of mass below 140 GeV can be obtained from the \(\gamma\gamma+\not\!\!E_{T}\) channel Figure 3: Significance of SM Higgs signal (\(m_{h}=120\) GeV) as a function of the minimum cut applied, for an integrated luminosity of 100 fb\({}^{-1}\). Above a cut of 80 GeV, only 10 events remain in the signal.

or an integrated luminosity of 100 fb\({}^{-1}\). In fact, if \(m_{h}=120\) GeV, even with only 30 fb\({}^{-1}\), 6 events would be observed with a background of 1.6 events.

It must be realized, however, that this analysis depends crucially on the capacity of the reconstruction software to measure the missing energy with good resolution and with little tail in the distribution. The error associated with this measurement

\end{table}
Table 3: Cross sections(fb), times appropriate branching ratios, for different Higgs masses. The number of events in the mass window around the resonance is shown, after cuts 1-4 have been applied is, at present, very hard to estimate. As mentioned in the introduction, initial and final state QED radiation in events from any process could contribute to the background if the missing energy resolution is poorly determined. Missing \(E_{T}\) may be also mismeasured if the energy scale of high energy jets is not well determined. Finally, uncertainties arise from the presence of underlying events. In these cases, other cuts could be applied, such as jet veto cuts which will reduce the number of QCD events. For example, the following cut was considered:

**Cut 5:** When jets are ordered in decreasing value of \(p\!\!\!/_{T}\), then the third jet must satisfy: \(p\!\!\!/_{T}(j_{3})<40\) GeV.

This cut removes all signal events originating from the \(t\bar{t}h\) process as well as background events from \(t\bar{t}\gamma\gamma\), but the signal remains significant as the other processes are not affected (see Fig. 5).

Other systematic errors must be taken into account. In particular, the efficiency of photon reconstruction was assumed to be 80%, but will have to be evaluated more precisely. Discrimination between photons and leptons must also be sufficient to reject dilepton events (e.g. \(WW\rightarrow\ell\ell\nu\nu\)).

Since \(Zh\) and \(Wh\) processes constitute a significant fraction of the observed events, and indeed the major fraction when cut 5 is applied, if the quality of \(E\!\!\!/_{T}\) reconstruction allows such a measurement to be performed, the results can serve to estimate the coupling of the Higgs to the gauge bosons, when combined with other

channels, as in [7]. The channels \(Zh\to\ell\ell X\) could also possibly serve to complement this measurement.
