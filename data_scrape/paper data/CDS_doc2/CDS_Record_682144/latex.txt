## 1 Introduction

A detailed description of the performance of the ATLAS detector for the discovery of intermediate mass standard Higgs has been presented in a note by D. Froidevaux & al. (PHYS-NO-011) involving a rather complete estimate of the background from \(t\bar{t}\) and \(Zb\bar{b}\).

This note addresses the possibility of using the measurement of the transverse impact parameter (IP) to further reduce the background originating from these two sources. Such a reduction would eventually permit the use of a smaller \(P_{t}\) cut on the leptons to increase the visibility of the signal, in particular for Higgs masses below 140 GeV or/and for runs at low luminosity.

In this study, all numbers refers to the channel \(H\to 4\mu\) detected in the ATLAS apparatus with air-core toroids. As the resolution on \(\mu\) momentum obtained from a combination of the toroids and the inner detector measurements approximatly matches the resolution on electrons energy in the EM calorimeter (in the range of momenta considered in this process), they can be easily extended to the other lepton channels. Also in this analysis, only the background contributions from the cascade decays \(t\bar{t}\to b\mu^{+}b\mu^{-}\to\mu^{-}X\mu^{+}Y\) and \(t\bar{t}\to b\bar{b}X\to c\mu^{-}\bar{c}\mu^{+}\to\mu^{+}X\mu^{-}Y\) are considered. The first one represents a fraction of the total \(t\bar{t}\) background (which is about 70% of the total background) ranging from 0.3 (for a \(P_{t}\) cut of 5 GeV/c) to 0.5 (\(P_{t}\) cut = 10GeV/c). The second one provides a example of background which could be potentially a problem at very low \(P_{t}\) but which is likely to be highly suppressed by an impact parameter cut.

This study still uses old fragmentation of t/b quarks in PYTHIA and ignores pile-up effects. Thus it may differ quantitatively from other recent analyses, especially when cuts on the isolation of the leptons are used. But what is important here is the background reduction which results from the IP cut.

The numbers of events are given for two different \(P_{t}\) cuts at the reconstruction level, 10 GeV/c and 5 GeV/c. With the low threshold, the ratio signal/background is reduced but it is shown that this loss in significance of the signal can be compensated by the addition of the IP cut.

## 2 The measurement of the impact parameter

A simplified version of the inner detector (as presented in the ATLAS LHCC/93-24 note) has been simulated. It consists in a barrel detector only-which is sketched in figure 1. This figure shows the geometry (radia), the resolution and the radiative thickness of the measurement layers. The detectors corresponding to the dashed lines stand for the two TRD/T layers :25 hits per track in each layer with a resolution of 150\(\mu m\) per hit).

The IP is assumed to be measured for muons with pseudo-rapidity \(\eta\) below 2.5. Both cases, with and without the SITV layer at R=20 cm, have been studied.

After tracking the muons in the inner detector, two methods have been used for the determination of the transverse impact parameter:

\(\bullet\)_Method_ 1 performs a circle fit over all the points of the inner detector taking into account the multiple scattering in the errors. In this fit, which does not use the vertex constraint, the momentum is a free parameter.

\(\bullet\)_Method_ 2 uses a circle fit with the momentum constrained by the measurement in the outer toroids. This constraint on the curvature reduces the error coming from the extrapolation from the inner-most layer of the SITV to the vertex. It is expected to bring a significant improvement when a large inner radius of this layer has to be used at large luminosities.

Figure 2 shows the mesured values of the-impact parameter as a function of the muon \(P_{t}\) for the two methods and for the cases with the SITV layer at R = 20 cm (\(R_{int}\) = 20 cm) and without this layer (\(R_{int}\) = 30 cm). These plots refer to muons originating from the decay

\(H\) = 4\(\mu\) with \(M_{H}\) = 130 GeV in a rapidity range =2.7. For method 1(3), the averages of the measured IPs are respectively 60 \(\mu\)m (30\(\mu\)m) and 90 \(\mu\)m (60\(\mu\)m) for an average muon \(P_{t}\) of 31 GeV. While the improvement provided by method 2 is marginal for \(R_{1\pi}\) = 20 cm, it becomes significant if this layer cannot be used at very high luminosities. In this case, the improvement operates mainly for high \(P_{t}\) muons where the toroid measurement is not dominated by the energy loss fluctuations in the calorimeter.

## 3 Results on the Higgs search

Only the "difficult" cases \(M_{H}\) = 120 GeV and \(M_{H}\) = 130 GeV have been considered.

The trigger which acts on muons in the rapidity domain \(\pm\) 2.5 requires either 2 muons with \(P_{t}\) > 8 GeV/c or one muon with \(P_{t}\) > 20 GeV/c. Requiring only one of these two conditions does not decrease significantly the number of Higgs events whereas a trigger condition based

Figure 2: _Measured impact parameters versus \(P_{t}\) for the different methods and SITV layouts._

on 2 muons with \(P_{t}>\) 20 GeV/c would decrease this number by 10%. All muons in a rapidity range of \(\cong\) 2.7 and with \(P_{t}>\) 5 GeV/c (or 10 GeV/c) are supposed to be detected and reconstructed with a 100% efficiency. Therefore, for comparison with the note PHYS-NO-11. the numbers of events quoted in this report have to divided by roughly a factor 2. The half window width for the Z mass cut is 6 GeV with the other muon pair required to have a mass larger than 10GeV. A simple and rather naive cut is done on the isolation of all 4 muons. It acts on all charged + neutral particles with \(P_{t}>\) 1.5 GeV (5 GeV for neutrals) and \(\Delta R=\sqrt{\Delta n^{+}+\Delta\sigma^{2}}>0.10\). As the pile-up is not included in this study, the effect of this naive cut is purely indicative especially when low \(P_{t}\) cuts are used. Together with a less tight cut on \(\Delta R\), this may explain the small reduction on the signal compared to the one observed in the note PHYS-NO-11 (50% reduction with brings another factor 2 in the comparison of event numbers).

All numbers are normalised to an integrated luminosity of \(10^{5}pb^{-1}\). Figure 3 shows the sum of the four measured impact parameters for the signal \(H\to 4\mu\) (solid curve) and the two considered backgrounds (\(tbb\overline{t}\) and \(bc\overline{c}\)). This sum is shown for the 2 methods in the case \(R_{int}\)=30cm where the difference is significant.

In fact the discrimination of the signal against the background makes use of a \(\chi^{2}\) which is simply the sum over the four squared measured impact parameters divided by the squared error coming from the fit. These \(\chi^{2}\) are shown on figure 4 for the two methods (\(R_{int}\)=30cm) together with the cut to discriminate the signal from the background. A \(\chi^{2}\) restricted to the two muons which give the highest contributions have also been tried leading to about the same background rejection.

An better optimization of the IP cut can certainly be done-based on the fact that the muons from the b decays have in average the lowest \(P_{t}\). One could also restrict the cut to the 2 muons which do not form the Z mass, those muons having more chance to be associated to the b rather than to the t decays. This restriction would also optimize the cut for the \(Zb\bar{b}\) background.

The results are summarised on table 1 (\(R_{int}=20cm\)) and table 2 (\(R_{int}=30cm\)). They give the numbers of events in a window around the Higgs mass with a half-width of 4 GeV \(\simeq 3\sigma_{M_{H}}\) (the values of the measured Higgs width in the 4 muons channels with differents detector options can be found in an addendum at the end of this report). The numbers of background events correspond to a window centered at \(M_{4\mu}\)=125 GeV. The results are also illustrated on figures 5 to 8 which show the 4-muons masses for differents cuts and different \(M_{H}\) and \(R_{int}\) for both methods. They correspond to a \(P_{t}\) cut of 5 GeV/c. The improvement afforded by method 2 is visible for \(R_{int}\)=30cm. For \(M_{H}\)=130 GeV the signal peaks clearly out of the background even without the isolation cut whereas this cut is needed for \(M_{H}\)=120 GeV. Nevertheless, one should remind that only part of the background is included and that the isolation cut in this study is certainly optimistic in its efficiency on the signal. Taking in addition the expected geometrical and detection inefficiencies, the signal at \(M_{H}\)=120 GeV is certainly not observable with muons only. Given the fact that the missing background from \(t\overline{t}\) is the most sensitive to the IP cut as suggested by the strong reduction of the \(bbc\overline{c}\) background, its observability in the \(e+\mu\) channel is not unrealistic.

## 4 Conclusion

With the low threshold on \(P_{t}\) allowed by the air-core toroid system, it is possible to increase significantly the number of signal events in the search for loss mass intermediate standard Higgs, provided that in addition a cut on the impact parameter is performed in order to reduce the additional background. If both the impact parameter and the isolation cuts are performed one may eventually detect Higgs with masses as low as 120 GeV in the four leptons channel.

If at high luminosity one is limited to a useable inner radius of \(R\geq 30cm\) in the vertex detector, the constraint provided by the external measurement provides a significant improvement on the impact parameter measurement.
