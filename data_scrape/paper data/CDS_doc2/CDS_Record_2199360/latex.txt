## 1 Introduction

The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN, a proton-proton (\(pp\)) collider with a nominal centre-of mass energy of \(\sqrt{s}=14\) TeV, produces hadronic jets in an unprecedented transverse momentum (\(p_{T}^{\rm jet}\)) regime, spanning several orders of magnitude, with jet transverse momenta as large as a few TeV. Jets originating from the hadronic or semileptonic decays of heavy particles, namely top quarks, Higgs and the weak vector bosons \(W/Z\), are of particular importance in searches for new physics signatures and precision measurements alike.

A variety of searches for physics beyond the Standard Model (BSM) require the efficient reconstruction and identification of highly energetic, so-called _boosted_, top quarks, Higgs and \(W/Z\) bosons in order to be sensitive to hypothetical new particles with masses in the TeV range. Notable examples are searches for massive resonances decaying to a pair of top quarks (\(X\to t\bar{t}\)) [1], a pair of Higgs bosons decaying to four bottom quarks (\(X\to hh\to(b\bar{b})(b\bar{b})\)) [2], or a pair of \(W\) bosons (\(X\to WW\)) [3].

The average angular separation between the decay products of a boosted particle \(X\) (where \(X\) may, for example, stand for a top quark, Higgs or \(W/Z\) boson) with mass \(m_{X}\) decreases inversely with its transverse momentum \(p_{T}^{X}\) according to a simple, empirical rule (as given, for example, in Ref. [4]):

\[\Delta R\approx 2m^{X}/p_{T}^{X} \tag{1}\]

where1\(\Delta R=\sqrt{\Delta y^{2}+\Delta\phi^{2}}\). Hence its decay products appear collimated in the direction of the decaying boosted particle.

Footnote 1: The standard coordinate system used by ATLAS is a right-handed orthogonal system with the z-axis tangential to the beam pipe. Its origin is defined as the nominal interaction point (IP) in the center of the detector. The x-axis is chosen to point from the IP to the center of the LHC ring, and the y-axis to point upwards perpendicular to the plane of the LHC ring. The detector geometry suggests the use of cylindrical coordinates (r, \(\phi\)) in the transverse plane where \(\phi\) is the azimuthal angle around the beam pipe. The pseudorapidity \(\eta\) = -ln tan(\(\theta\)/2) is used as the third coordinate instead of the polar angle \(\theta\). For massive objects, the pseudo-rapidity \(\eta\) is replaced by the rapidity \(y\) in the calculation of the distance measure \(\Delta R_{ij}\).

At low \(p_{T}^{X}\), the decay products tend to be well separated in the detector and can be reconstructed as individual objects. In this so-called _resolved_ regime, the hadronic decay of a top quark (Higgs or \(W/Z\) boson) is reconstructed from three (two) jets with small \(R\) parameter (see Section 4.1 for its definition). In ATLAS, these are commonly chosen to be anti-\(k_{t}\)\(R=0.4\) jets, see for example Refs. [1; 2].

At higher \(p_{T}^{X}\), the decay products tend to be found in the same region of the detector and are more likely to overlap, thus preventing them to be reconstructed separately by standard reconstruction approaches as described above. Instead, in this so-called _boosted_ regime, the hadronically decaying boosted object is reconstructed as a single jet with a large \(R\) parameter. In ATLAS, this jet is commonly chosen to be either an anti-\(k_{t}\)\(R=1.0\) (see for example Refs. [1; 2; 3]) or a Cambridge-Aachen (C-A) \(R=1.2\) or \(R=1.5\) jet (see for example Refs. [4; 5]) with a substructure consistent with the 3-body decay \(t\to Wb\), or the 2-body decays \(h\to b\bar{b}\) and \(W\to q\bar{q}\). In this merged regime, the fully hadronic \(t\bar{t}\to(bq\bar{q})(\bar{b}q\bar{q})\), \(hh\to(b\bar{b})(b\bar{b})\), and \(WW\to(q\bar{q})(q\bar{q})\) final states exhibit a simple dijet event topology.

In recent years, a wide range of dedicated techniques has been developed to identify, or \(tag\), the substructure of jets in order to distinguish jets from the decays of boosted objects from those initiated by light quarks or gluons, see for example [6; 7; 8]. All current taggers rely on jets with a constant, pre-defined distance parameter \(R\) that is independent of the jet transverse momentum.

In this note, we propose the use of an alternative jet algorithm, the **variable-R (VR)** jet algorithm [9], for the reconstruction of boosted object decays. The size of VR jets decreases like \(1/p_{T}^{\rm jet}\), making them well suited for the application in boosted event topologies as the collimation of the decay products, described by Equation 1, implies that the hadronic shower from the top-quark or boson decay keeps shrinking like approximately \(1/p_{T}^{\rm jet}\). Hence any reconstruction approach that relies on a large jet with a fixed \(R\)-parameter is likely to overestimate the size of the hadronic shower from a top quark or boson at high \(p_{T}^{X}\). At the same time, the large area of large-\(R\) jets renders them more prone than VR jets to contaminations from pile-up, the Underlying Event (UE), and initial-state radiation (ISR).2

Footnote 2: Final-state radiation (FSR) can not be considered a contamination in a strict sense. For example, it should ideally be included in the reconstruction of the invariant mass of the boosted objects from a resonance decay for the reconstructed mass to be close to the resonance mass. In contrast, for measurements of top-quark properties, FSR from the top quark should not be included in the reconstruction, while FSR from its decay products should be taken into account. Most current analyses involving boosted objects do not include explicit stategies for the treatment of FSR effects. Hence FSR will not be discussed further in this note.

We study the performance of VR jets for boosted-object tagging in fully hadronic \(t\bar{t}\to(bq\bar{q})(\bar{b}q\bar{q})\), \(hh\to(b\bar{b})(b\bar{b})\), and \(WW\to(q\bar{q})(q\bar{q})\) final states. Final states with hadronically decaying \(Z\) bosons are not considered here explicitly. The performance results for these final states are expected to be similar to those obtained for \(WW\) final states due to the fact that the difference between \(m_{Z}\) and \(m_{W}\) is small compared to those between \(m_{W}\), \(m_{h}\) and \(m_{\rm top}\).

The aim of this note is to introduce VR jets as an alternative to traditional fixed-\(R\) jet algorithms for the reconstruction and identification of a number of boosted objects, to derive suitable parameters for the VR jet algorithm, and to present a range of generic performance studies for different final states in order to provide recommendations for analyses aiming to use VR jets and guidelines for the development of more specific VR-based taggers. In the case of top quarks, a tagging algorithm based on VR jets has recently been proposed [10]. The results for final states with boosted Higgs and \(W\) bosons presented in this note are the first concrete application of VR jets in Higgs and \(W\) tagging to date.

The note is structured as follows: In Section 2, the ATLAS detector is described. Details of the simulated samples used for the performance studies are given in Section 3. The VR jet algorithm is introduced in Section 4, followed by a discussion of the choice of suitable parameters for VR jet collections tailored towards the reconstruction of boosted objects. The analysis setup for the performance studies is described in Section 5. Finally, the performance of both ungroomed (Section 6) and trimmed (Section 7) VR jets in the reconstruction and identification of boosted \(t\bar{t}\to(bq\bar{q})(\bar{b}q\bar{q})\), \(hh\to(b\bar{b})(b\bar{b})\), and \(WW\to(q\bar{q})(q\bar{q})\) final states is discussed.

## 2 The ATLAS Detector

The ATLAS detector [11] is a multiple-purpose detector at the LHC designed to identify particles created in \(pp\) collisions and to reconstruct their full four-vectors. Its cylindrical geometry provides a nearly \(4\pi\) coverage around the interaction point. It consists of an inner detector (ID), surrounded by a calorimeter system and a Muon Spectrometer (MS). The ID covers the pseudorapidity range \(|\eta|<2.5\) and features multiple silicon-based pixel and strip layers as well as a straw-tube transition radiation (TRT) detector. It is placed inside the field of a superconducting solenoid magnet with a field strength of 2 T. The calorimeter system surrounding both the ID and solenoid magnet provides coverage over the range \(|\eta|<4.9\). It consists of two sub-systems: The lead and liquid-argon (LAr) based electromagnetic calorimeter system in the barrel and end-cap regions covers the pseudorapidity range \(|\eta|<3.2\). The surrounding hadroniccalorimeter system consists of a steel and scintillating-tile calorimeter in the barrel region (\(|\eta|<1.7\)) and two copper and LAr hadronic end-cap calorimeters covering the pseudorapidity range \(1.5<|\eta|<3.2\). Additional copper/LAr and tungsten/LAr calorimeter modules extend the pseudorapidity coverage in the forward region up to \(|\eta|=4.9\). The calorimeters are surrounded by the MS which consists of muon drift tubes placed within the field of an air-core toroid magnet. It allows for precise stand-alone measurements of the muon track momenta within the pseudorapidity range \(|\eta|<2.7\).

## 3 Simulated Data Samples

The studies presented in this note rely on Monte Carlo samples of simulated data for both signal and background events. A number of different Monte Carlo generators are used for the simulation of the different signal and background processes.

Background jets from QCD multijet production are obtained from samples of QCD dijet events simulated with the Pythia v8.168 [12] generator using the NNPDF2.3 LO PDF set [13] and the A14 tune [14].

Jets originating from top-quark decays are obtained from simulated events in which a topcolor, leptophobic \(Z^{\prime}\) resonance, as defined by model IV in Harris et al. [15; 16], decays to a pair of top quarks (\(t\bar{t}\)). The hard scattering process at leading order as well as the parton shower and hadronisation process are generated with Pythia v8.168 using the NNPDF2.3 LO PDF set and the A14 tune, as in the case of the background samples. The decays of bottom and charm quarks are performed with EvtGen v.1.2.0 [17]. A number of different samples with resonance masses in the range 0.4-5.0 TeV is generated to obtain top quarks with a wide range of transverse momenta. Both hadronic and semileptonic top-quark decays are simulated and the mass of the top quark is set to 172.5 GeV.

Jets from the decays of Higgs and \(W\) bosons are obtained from simulated events in which a hypothetical resonance, the "bulk" Randall-Sundrum (RS) graviton [18; 19], \(G^{*}_{KK}\), decays into a pair of Higgs bosons (\(G^{*}_{KK}\to hh\)) or a pair of \(W\) bosons (\(G^{*}_{KK}\to WW\)).3 MadGraph5_aMC@NLO v.2.2.2 [20] with the NNPDF2.3 LO PDF set and the A14 tune is used to generate the production and decay of the RS graviton at leading order in QCD. As in the case of the \(Z^{\prime}\to t\bar{t}\) samples, the parton shower and hadronisation process are simulated with Pythia v8.168 and EvtGen is used to model the decays of bottom and charm quarks. For the \(G^{*}_{KK}\to WW\) final state, resonance masses in the range 1.0-5.0 TeV have been generated. In the case of the \(G^{*}_{KK}\to hh\), samples with resonance masses in the range 0.3-3.0 TeV are available. The mass of the Higgs (\(W\)) boson is set to 125.0 GeV (80.4 GeV).

Footnote 3: For all samples, the ratio \(k/\bar{M}_{\rm Pl}\) of the curvature \(k\) of the warped extra dimension and the effective four-dimensional Planck scale, \(\bar{M}_{\rm Pl}=2.4\cdot 10^{18}\) GeV, is set to 1.0.

The effects of multiple \(pp\) collisions in the same or subsequent bunch crossings (pile-up) are simulated by overlaying minimum bias events on each signal and background event. The minimum bias events are simulated with Pythia v8.168 with the A2M tune [21] and the MSTW2008LO PDF set [22].

The stable particles obtained after the generation of the hard process, parton showering and hadronisation are passed through a simulation of the ATLAS detector [23], based on GEANT4 [24], to model the interaction of the generated particles with the detector material. The energy deposits in the active parts of the detector are then digitised and reconstructed with the same reconstruction software as used for data.

The respective signal samples are combined and weighted such that the transverse momentum distribution of the leading anti-\(k_{t}\)\(R=1.0\) jet at particle level4 matches that of the background. This reweighting procedure is used to remove any possible bias of the signal efficiency within the \(p_{T}^{\rm jet}\) regions defined in Section 5.

Footnote 4: Particle-level jets are defined in Section 4.1.

## 4 Variable-\(R\) Jets

### Sequential Recombination Algorithms

Jets can be described as topologically related, localised groups of input objects, such as (locally calibrated) topological clusters [25] in the ATLAS calorimeter (calorimeter jets) or charged-particle tracks in the ID (track jets). Alternatively, jets may also be reconstructed from simulated particles (particle-level jets). In ATLAS, these are typically taken to be observable particles with laboratory-frame lifetimes (\(c\tau>10\) mm) long enough to reach the detectors but exluding muons and neutrinos. Various algorithms are available to construct jets from a given set of input objects. All jet algorithms described and used in this note have been implemented in the FastJet [26] package (v3.1).

Today, the most common jet algorithms in use are sequential recombination algorithms which rely on two metrics to iteratively combine the input particles into jets. Details of the clustering procedure are given, for example, in Ref. [26]. The metrics are defined to be the pairwise distance \(d_{ij}\) between two proto-jets5\(i\) and \(j\), and the distance \(d_{iB}\) between a proto-jet \(i\) and the beam axis:

Footnote 5: Proto-jets are input particles or combinations thereof in later clustering steps.

\[d_{ij} =\min(p_{Ti}^{2n},p_{Tj}^{2n})\ \Delta R_{ij}^{2} \tag{2}\] \[d_{iB} =p_{Ti}^{2n}\ R_{0}^{2} \tag{3}\]

where \(\Delta R_{ij}=\sqrt{\Delta y_{ij}^{2}+\Delta\phi_{ij}^{2}}\) denotes the geometrical distance between \(i\) and \(j\). The parameter \(n\) determines the type of jet algorithm. The case \(n=0\) corresponds to the _Cambridge-Aachen (C/A)_ algorithm [27; 28], the case \(n=1\) refers to the \(k_{t}\) algorithm [29; 30], and \(n=-1\) yields the _anti-\(k_{t}\)_ algorithm [31]. The latter is the most commonly used jet algorithm within ATLAS and hence the algorithm which - along with its VR modification - is studied in this note.

The parameter \(R_{0}\) in Equation 3 plays a particularly important role with regard to the topic of this note as it determines the effective size of the jets which, in the class of algorithms introduced above, is independent of the transverse momentum \(p_{T}^{\rm jet}\) of the jets.

### The Variable-\(R\) Jet Algorithm

The VR jet algorithm represents a generalisation of the sequential recombination algorithms introduced in the previous sections. It was originally developed for the reconstruction of the hadronic showers initiated by the partons \(p_{1}\), \(p_{2}\), from the decay of a heavy resonance \(X\to p_{1}p_{2}\) or partons from cascade decays of supersymmetry particles, where the partons are assumed to be light quarks or gluons [9]. The introduction of VR jets was motivated by the fact that the two gluon-initiated jets from the decay \(X\to gg\) are expected to have a uniform size in angular coordinates \((\theta,\phi)\), irrespective of their orientation with respect to the beam axis [9]. In contrast, traditional anti-\(k_{t}\) jets have a uniform size in \((\eta,\phi)\) coordinates, implying that a forward jet, i.e. a jet close to the beam axis, has a smaller angular size than a central jet.

In the VR jet algorithm, the \(R_{0}\) parameter in Equation 2 is replaced by a function of the transverse momentum of the proto-jet \(i\):

\[R_{0}\longrightarrow R_{eff}(p_{T,i})=\frac{\rho}{p_{T,i}}. \tag{4}\]

The new parameter \(\rho\) determines how fast the effective jet size decreases with the transverse momentum of the jet. In addition to \(\rho\), the VR algorithm requires two more parameters, \(R_{\rm min}\) and \(R_{\rm max}\), to impose lower and upper cut-offs on the jet size, respectively. This prevents the jets from becoming too large at low \(p_{T}^{\rm jet}\) and from shrinking below the detector resolution at high \(p_{T}^{\rm jet}\). The effective jet size varies smoothly between \(R_{\rm min}\) and \(R_{\rm max}\).

The resulting jets are uniform in \((\theta,\phi)\)- rather than in \((\eta,\phi)\)-coordinates, as intended. As a result, the size of VR jets in conventional \((\eta,\phi)\)-coordinates depends on \(p_{T}^{\rm jet}\). This allows for VR jets to be used to develop a more dynamic and unified reconstruction approach for boosted objects in a transverse momentum regime spanning several orders of magnitude, as will be explained in the following section.

The VR jet algorithm is available as a FastJet plug-in.6. In principle, VR versions of the anti-\(k_{t}\), the C/A and the \(k_{t}\) algorithm can be built. In this note, we will focus on anti-\(k_{t}\) based VR jets. The application of C/A-based VR jets for top tagging is explored in [10].

Footnote 6: The results in this note have been derived with VariableR v1.1.1. Recently, a faster version of the algorithm has been released as VariableR v1.2.1.

### Choice of Variable-\(R\) Parameter Values

To find physically sound values for the parameters of the VR jets that are to be used in the reconstruction of hadronically decaying boosted particles a closer study of the properties of the hadronic shower originating from a boosted particle decay is in order. The aim is to study in particular the (average) radial size of the hadronic shower as a function of \(p_{T}^{\rm jet}\) to derive a value for the \(\rho\)-parameter, which controls the shrinking behaviour of VR jets.

Based on equation 1, a first estimate for the \(\rho\) parameter would be roughly \(2\cdot m_{\rm top}=350\) GeV for boosted hadronic top quark decays or \(\rho\approx 2\cdot m_{h}=250\) GeV (\(\rho\approx 2\cdot m_{W}=160\) GeV) for boosted \(h\to b\bar{b}\) (\(W\to(q\bar{q})\)) decays. However, while this rule holds well at parton-level, showering and hadronisation lead to an additional widening of the top or boson jet, making it necessary to re-evaluate the choice of \(\rho\) based on jet-level studies.

Ideally, VR jet collections with different \(\rho\) parameters would be used for the reconstruction of different boosted objects to provide the best description for the respective boosted decay and achieve optimal performance results. However, based on practical considerations, such as limitations in computing and storage resources, and the need to calibrate and derive systematic uncertainties for each new jet collection, a single VR jet collection will be studied in this note. Its parameters are optimised for boosted top-quark decays as the showers from the decays of the lighter Higgs and \(W\) bosons are more collimated for a given transverse momentum scale and hence even more likely to be contained within a single VR jet, with the VR jets potentially overestimating the size of the Higgs or \(W\) boson jet.

#### 4.3.1 Choice of \(\rho\) for boosted top quarks

An estimate of \(\rho\) parameter values suited for the reconstruction of boosted top quarks is obtained by studying the radial transverse momentum profile of large, fixed-\(R\) jets associated with a boosted top-quark decay. The change of the radial jet profile with the jet transverse momentum \(p_{T}^{\rm jet}\) allows for an estimate of the shrinking rate of the hadronic shower initiated by the top quark.

In the following, a _top jet_ is defined as the large-\(R\) jet closest to a hadronically decaying top quark within \(\Delta R({\rm jet,top})<0.75\cdot R\). The top-quark four momentum at the decay vertex is used in the calculation of \(\Delta R({\rm jet,top})\). The jet profile is studied for anti-\(k_{t}\)\(R=1.0\) jets at calorimeter- and particle-level with and without a trimming7 procedure applied to remove contaminations from pile-up and the UE. Jets without any pile-up mitigation procedure applied are referred to as _ungroomed_ jets in the following. The jet profiles obtained for the four different jet collections discussed above are compared in order to test the robustness of the \(\rho\) parameter estimation against detector effects and against contamination from pile-up and the UE.

Footnote 7: The trimming algorithm and its parameter values are discussed in Section 5.

Top jets are taken from a sample of simulated \(Z^{\prime}\) resonance decays. Resonance masses \(m_{Z^{\prime}}\) between 1.0 and 5.0 TeV are used in order to provide sufficient statistics over a large range of \(p_{T}^{\rm jet}\). For each jet matched to a hadronically decaying top quark, the distance of each constituent from the jet axis is plotted in bins of \(p_{T}^{\rm jet}\). Each entry is weighted by the transverse momentum of the constituent and each slice in \(p_{T}^{\rm jet}\) is normalised to the number of jets within this slice. The resulting radial transverse momentum profile of these jets shown in Figure 1 (a).

Each slice in \(p_{T}^{\rm jet}\) can be integrated to obtain the radius \(R_{y}(p_{T}^{\rm jet})\) which contains a certain fraction \(y\) of the jet transverse momentum in a given \(p_{T}^{\rm jet}\) bin. The resulting curves for the values \(y=90.0\%\) (black), \(y=92.5\%\) (red), and \(y=95.0\%\) (blue) are shown in Figure 2 (a). These curves can be accurately described by the fit function \(f(p_{T}^{\rm jet})=a_{0}/(p_{T}^{\rm jet}-a_{1})\), which confirms the expected \(1/p_{T}^{\rm jet}\) shrinking behaviour of the top jet. The fit range is restricted to \(p_{T}^{\rm jet}>400\) GeV since below this value the decay products are most likely not fully contained within a single jet. The fit parameter \(a_{0}\) can be used as an estimate of the \(\rho\) parameter for the VR jet collection that is best suited for the reconstruction of final states with boosted top quarks.

**Choice of the integration parameter \(y\)**

The value of the fit parameter \(a_{0}\) depends on both the choice of the top jet and the exact choice of the integration parameter \(y\), as illustrated in Figure 2 (a). The fit results are \(a_{0}\approx 500\) GeV, \(a_{0}\approx 600\) GeV, and \(a_{0}\approx 800\) GeV for the integration parameter choices \(y=90.0\%\), \(y=92.5\%\), and \(y=95.0\%\), respectively. For \(y\) approaching values of \(100\%\) the fit values \(a_{0}\) become very large. This is understandable because even at high \(p_{T}^{\rm top}\) there is a finite chance of finding a jet constituent at a large distance from the jet axis. The presence of pile-up, which can be regarded as more or less homogeneous distribution of soft energy deposits in the calorimeter, increases the chance of such outliers that do not stem from the original top quark decay but are nevertheless clustered into the jet and not always completely removed by trimming. If the enveloping curve obtained from the integral in Figure 1 (a) was to contain all of these outliers (\(y=100\%\)), the fit curve would be essentially flat. To avoid such boundary and statistics effects, a \(y\)-value of the order of 90%-95% promises to be a good choice to ensure that all top-quark decay products are contained within a single VR jet.

### Choice of the top jet

In Figure 2, the radial \(p_{T}^{\rm jet}\) profiles and fit values for ungroomed and trimmed anti-\(k_{t}\)\(R=1.0\) jets at calorimeter and particle level are shown. The comparison between Figures 2 (a) and (b) clearly shows the effects of pile-up on the ungroomed jets which appear wider on average and feature a larger value for the fit parameter \(a_{0}\). In Figures 2 (c) and (d) the corresponding particle-level curves for ungroomed and trimmed jets are shown. Although no pile-up effects are simulated at particle level, similar albeit smaller differences between the ungroomed and trimmed case are visible. These can be attributed to soft contaminations from the UE which are mostly removed by trimming.

For trimmed jets, the values for the fit parameter \(a_{0}\) show acceptable agreement between truth and calorimeter level. The observed slightly bigger average jet size and \(a_{0}\) parameter for the latter is expected, firstly, because of the finite calorimeter resolution and, secondly, because trimming does not fully remove all effects of pile-up from the jets. However, the good agreement between the radial profiles of trimmed jets at particle and calorimeter level indicates that trimmed jets serve as a fair representation of the shower from hadronically decaying top quark. Hence the value of the \(\rho\) parameter is chosen based on the fit values for trimmed anti-\(k_{t}\)\(R=1.0\) jets.

VR jet collections with \(\rho\) values corresponding to the \(a_{0}\) fit values for \(y=90.0\%\), \(92.5\%\) and \(95.0\%\) have been generated and their properties compared to those of trimmed anti-\(k_{t}\)\(R=1.0\) jets. Based on these comparisons and the above considerations a \(\rho\)-value of \(600\) GeV is chosen as it yields the best overall performance. Smaller values of \(\rho\) that are more suited for the reconstruction of Higgs and \(W\) bosons, as discussed at the beginning of Section 4.3, for example the choice \(\rho=m_{h}/m_{\rm top}\cdot 600\) GeV = 400 GeV, have been tested and found to slightly increase the performance results for these objects. A more systematic exploration of alternative parameter values for these objects is left to future studies.

Figure 1: Radial \(p_{T}^{\rm jet}\) profile for trimmed anti-\(k_{t}\)\(R=1.0\) calorimeter jets in \(t\bar{t}\) events: Distance \(\Delta R(\rm{constit},\rm{axis})\) between each constituent (= locally calibrated topological calorimeter cluster) and the jet axis as a function of \(p_{T}^{\rm jet}\). Each entry is weighted by the transverse momentum of the constituent and each slice in \(p_{T}^{\rm jet}\) is normalised to the number of jets within this slice. The colour code on the \(z\) axis denotes the fraction of constituents at a given distance from the jet axis in the given \(p_{T}^{\rm jet}\) bin.

#### 4.3.2 Choice of \(R_{\rm max}\) and \(R_{\rm min}\)

The remaining two parameters are chosen based on the following considerations: The maximum jet size is set to be \(R_{\rm max}=1.0\) so that in the low transverse momentum regime (\(p_{T}^{\rm jet}<\rho/R_{\rm max}=600\) GeV) the anti-\(k_{t}\) VR jets are identical to anti-\(k_{t}\)\(R=1.0\) jets which serve as the reference jet collection in the studies presented in this note. The minimum jet size is chosen to be \(R_{\rm min}=0.2\) to ensure that the effective size of VR calorimeter jets is well above the maximum size of the topological calorimeter clusters from which they are built. The VR jets will reach their minimal size for \(p_{T}^{\rm jet}>\rho/R_{\rm min}=3.0\) TeV.

Figure 2: Radial \(p_{T}^{\rm jet}\) profile fits for different collections of anti-\(k_{t}\) 1.0 jets: Calorimeter level (upper plots) and particle level (lower plots), both with trimming (left plots) and without any grooming applied (right plots). Fits are performed to the curves containing a fraction \(y\) of \(p_{T}^{\rm jet}\) where \(y=90.0\%\) (black), \(92.5\%\) (red), \(95.0\%\) (blue). The fit values for the parameter \(a_{0}\) are given in the legend and the fit function is defined in the text.

## 5 Analysis Setup

The performance of VR calorimeter jets with parameter values \(\rho=600\) GeV, \(R_{\text{max}}=1.0\), and \(R_{\text{min}}=0.2\) (Section 4.3) is compared to that of anti-\(k_{t}\)\(R=1.0\) calorimeter jets. Trimmed [32] anti-\(k_{t}\)\(R=1.0\) jets, which are most commonly used in boosted object taggers within ATLAS, serve as the benchmark jet collection. In the trimming procedure, the jet constituents are reclustered into \(k_{t}\) subjets with \(R_{\text{sub}}=0.2\) and only subjets with a transverse momentum fraction greater than \(f_{\text{cut}}=5\%\) are kept. These values of \(R_{\text{sub}}\) and \(f_{\text{cut}}\) are the standard trimming parameters used within ATLAS in Run 2 [33].

In the case of VR jets, both ungroomed and trimmed jet collections are studied. In Section 6, ungroomed VR jets are compared to both trimmed and ungroomed anti-\(k_{t}\)\(R=1.0\) jets to demonstrate the performance improvements due to their variable size. In Section 7, trimmed VR jets are considered, in addition to ungroomed VR jets, and compared to the traditional trimmed anti-\(k_{t}\)\(R=1.0\) jets.

The performance of the different jet collections is compared in three mutually exclusive regions of the jet transverse momentum, defined in Table 1. The transverse momentum \(p_{T}^{\text{jet}}\) is the transverse momentum at calorimeter level for a given jet collection. Only jets within the pseudorapidity range \(|\eta^{\text{jet}}|<2.0\) are considered. No energy or mass calibration has been applied to any of the jet collections considered in this note.

## 6 Results for Ungroomed Variable-\(R\) Jets

In the following subsections, ungroomed VR jets are compared to both trimmed and ungroomed anti-\(k_{t}\)\(R=1.0\) jets in the low, medium, and high \(p_{T}^{\text{jet}}\) regimes. The comparison is done for three jet variables: the jet mass, calculated from the sum of four-momenta of the constituent calorimeter cell clusters, the first \(k_{t}\) splitting scale [29], denoted as \(\sqrt{d_{12}}\), and the ratio of the 3- and 2-subjettiness variables [34; 35], \(\tau_{32}=\tau_{3}/\tau_{2}\). These variables are of particular interest for performance studies because they are commonly used as discriminating variables in top taggers to distinguish jets from the hadronic decays of boosted top quarks from QCD background jets [6; 36].

### Performance in \(t\bar{t}\) Final States

#### 6.1.1 Jet mass

The jet mass distributions for both VR and anti-\(k_{t}\)\(R=1.0\) jets in the low, medium, and high \(p_{T}^{\text{jet}}\) regimes are shown in Figure 3. The distributions for signal jets are given by solid lines, those for jets from the

QCD dijets background are given by dotted lines. In the low \(p_{T}^{\rm jet}\) regime, shown in Figure 3 (a), the average size of VR jets is comparable to that of anti-\(k_{t}\ R=1.0\) jets and hence the corresponding signal and background distributions (blue lines) resemble those of ungroomed anti-\(k_{t}\ R=1.0\) jets (grey lines) and differ notably from those for trimmed anti-\(k_{t}\ R=1.0\) jets (black lines). The differences between trimmed and ungroomed jets are clearly visible in both the signal and background distributions. For trimmed anti-\(k_{t}\ R=1.0\) jets, the signal distribution peaks close to \(m_{\rm top}\) with a smaller second peak close to \(m_{W}\), a result of the fact that in this \(p_{T}^{\rm jet}\) regime not all top-quark decay products are contained within a single jet. The background distribution is notably different from the signal distribution, with the bulk of the distribution well below 100 GeV. In the case of both ungroomed jet collections, the contaminations from pile-up increase the typical masses of both signal and background jets. This leads to the signal mass peak being shifted to above 200 GeV and visibly broadened, with the \(W\)-mass peak no longer discernible. The differences between trimmed and ungroomed jets is even more significant for the background distributions, with the bulk of the mass distributions for ungroomed jets roughly between 100 and 200 GeV.

In the medium and high \(p_{T}^{\rm jet}\) regimes, shown in Figures 3 (b) and (c), respectively, the distributions for VR jets are remarkably similar to those of trimmed anti-\(k_{t}\ R=1.0\) jets and both differ clearly from the corresponding distributions for ungroomed anti-\(k_{t}\ R=1.0\) jets. In particular, the signal distributions for both ungroomed VR and trimmed anti-\(k_{t}\ R=1.0\) jets feature a clear peak close to \(m_{\rm top}\) whereas for ungroomed anti-\(k_{t}\ R=1.0\) jets this peak is visibly shifted towards mass values between 200 and 300 GeV as a result of pile-up. A more detailed discussion of the width and position of the signal mass peaks for the different jet collections can be found in Section 7.1.2.

These observations indicate that the simple fact that VR jets shrink around the more and more collimated top-quark decay products, thus minimising the jet area as far as possible, is enough to significantly reduce the effects of pile-up on the jet mass in a way that is similar to trimming. Small differences are observed for the shape of the mass distributions for background jets. While these differences may be partly attributed to the lack of a grooming procedure for these VR jets, similar, albeit smaller differences are also seen for trimmed VR jets, as shown in Section 7.1.2. A possible explanation for these shape differences in the background mass distributions will be discussed in Section 7.2.2.

The performance of the jet mass as a discriminating variable can be quantified for the different jet collections by varying a hypothetical lower bound on the jet mass and evaluating the signal efficiency \(\epsilon_{S}\) and the corresponding background rejection (1-\(\epsilon_{B}\)) for each value of this lower bound. In Figure 4, the background rejection is given as a function of the signal efficiency for the variation of a hypothetical lower bound on the distributions Figure 3. For the sake of brevity, figures of this type will be referred to by the commonly used term _ROC curve_ in the remainder of this note.

While in the low \(p_{T}^{\rm jet}\) regime, the performance of VR jets is clearly inferior to that of both trimmed and ungroomed anti-\(k_{t}\ R=1.0\) jets, the medium and high \(p_{T}^{\rm jet}\) regimes show notable performance improvements for VR jets compared to ungroomed and even trimmed anti-\(k_{t}\ R=1.0\) jets. In particular, for any given value of the signal efficiency, VR jets yield consistently higher values of the background rejection than trimmed anti-\(k_{t}\ R=1.0\) jets. The benefits of applying a trimming procedure to VR jets in order to increase their performance in the low \(p_{T}^{\rm jet}\) regime will be discussed in Section 7.

The curves are obtained by varying the value of a hypothetical lower bound on the jet mass. Results are given for ungroomed VR jets (blue), trimmed anti-\(k_{t}\)\(R=1.0\) jets (black) and ungroomed anti-\(k_{t}\)\(R=1.0\) jets (grey).

#### 6.1.2 First \(k_{t}\) splitting scale

The signal and background distributions for the first \(k_{t}\) splitting scale \(\sqrt{d_{12}}\) and the corresponding ROC curves for the variation of a lower bound on \(\sqrt{d_{12}}\) are given in Figure 5. Like in the case of the jet mass, notable performance improvements are observed for ungroomed VR jets compared to both trimmed and ungroomed anti-\(k_{t}\)\(R=1.0\) in the medium and high \(p_{T}^{\rm jet}\) regimes. The differences between ungroomed and trimmed jets are smaller than in the case of the jet mass, as the latter is more sensitive to contaminations from pile-up than the \(k_{t}\) splitting scales.

The curves are obtained from the normalised distributions on the left by varying the value of a hypothetical lower bound on \(\sqrt{d_{12}}\).

#### 6.1.3 \(n\)-subjettiness ratio \(\tau_{32}\)

The \(n\)-subjettiness ratio \(\tau_{32}\) has been found to be another powerful discriminating variable for the identification of jets from top-quark decays [6; 36]. The distributions of \(\tau_{32}\) for signal and background events reconstructed with ungroomed VR and either trimmed or ungroomed anti-\(k_{t}R=1.0\) jets are given in the left column of Figure 6. The corresponding performance plots, derived for a variation of the _upper_ bound on \(\tau_{32}\), are given in the right column Figure 6.

Notably, both ungroomed VR and ungroomed anti-\(k_{t}\)\(R=1.0\) jets out-perform trimmed anti-\(k_{t}\)\(R=1.0\) jets in all three \(p_{T}^{\text{jet}}\) regions. The poorer performance of \(n\)-subjettiness variables for trimmed compared to ungroomed jets is presumably a result of the fact that the trimming procedure affects the radiation pattern within the jet to which the \(n\)-subjettiness variables are sensitive. For example, the trimming procedure may remove a subjet originating from one of the quarks from the top-quark decay if it is comparatively soft. This may be the case even for highly boosted top quarks if decay product is emitted in roughly the opposite direction to the momentum of its mother particle.

The curves are obtained from the normalised distributions on the left by varying the value of a hypothetical upper bound on \(\tau_{32}\).

#### 6.1.4 Summary

The performance of _ungroomed_, anti-\(k_{t}\) based, VR jets, defined by the parameter values \(R_{\rm max}=1.0\), \(R_{\rm min}=0.2\), and \(\rho=600\) GeV, has been compared to that of _trimmed_ and ungroomed anti-\(k_{t}\)\(R=1.0\) jets for the jet mass, the first \(k_{t}\) splitting scale \(\sqrt{d_{12}}\), and the \(n\)-subjettiness ratio \(\tau_{32}\). VR jets out-perform both trimmed and ungroomed anti-\(k_{t}\)\(R=1.0\) jets for \(p_{T}^{\rm jet}>1.0\) TeV in the case of the jet mass and the \(k_{t}\) splitting scale without relying on any grooming techniques themselves. The improvements are a result of the smaller jet areas that render VR jets more robust against contaminations from pile-up, ISR, and the UE. Further improvements, in particular in the low-\(p_{T}\) regime (\(p_{T}^{\rm jet}<1.0\) TeV) can be expected from an additional grooming of VR jets. Trimmed VR jets will be discussed in Section 7.

## 7 Results for Trimmed Variable-_R_ Jets

As shown in Section 6, ungroomed VR jets out-perform traditional trimmed anti-\(k_{t}\)\(R=1.0\) in the identification of jets from boosted hadronically-decaying top quarks for jet transverse momenta \(p_{T}^{\text{jet}}>1\) TeV. For smaller values of the jet transverse momentum, the corresponding VR jets are comparable in size to anti-\(k_{t}\)\(R=1.0\) jets and accordingly more affected by contaminations from pile-up and the UE.

For VR jets to be a feasible alternative to traditional trimmed anti-\(k_{t}\)\(R=1.0\) jets in all \(p_{T}^{\text{jet}}\) regions, a grooming procedure has to be applied to VR jets as well. The use of a trimming algorithm with the same parameters, \(R_{\text{sub}}=0.2\) and \(f_{\text{cut}}=0.05\), as used for anti-\(k_{t}\)\(R=1.0\) jets is an obvious choice given that for \(p_{T}^{\text{jet}}<0.6\) TeV VR jets are identical to anti-\(k_{t}\)\(R=1.0\) jets. Given the fixed size of the \(k_{t}\) subjets in the trimming procedure, it is obvious that trimming will be most effective for VR jets with small transverse momenta. For very high transverse momenta, for which the effective size of VR jets approaches \(R_{\text{min}}=0.2\), the \(k_{t}\) reclustering is more likely to result in a single \(k_{t}\) "subjet" carrying the full momentum of the VR jet and no constituents will be removed.

### Performance in \(t\bar{t}\) Final States

In the following sections, the performance of trimmed VR jets is compared to that of ungroomed VR and trimmed anti-\(k_{t}\)\(R=1.0\) jets. The discriminating variables considered here are the same as in the performance studies for ungroomed VR jets in Section 6, namely the jet mass, the first \(k_{t}\) splitting scale \(\sqrt{d_{12}}\), and the \(n\)-subjettiness ratio \(\tau_{32}\).

#### 7.1.1 Jet mass

The mass distributions for both trimmed and ungroomed VR jets are given in the left column Figure 7, along with those for trimmed anti-\(k_{t}\)\(R=1.0\) jets. The corresponding ROC curves are shown in the right column of Figure 7. As expected, the effect of trimming decreases for higher values of \(p_{T}^{\text{jet}}\), resulting in almost identical behaviour for trimmed and ungroomed VR jets in the medium and high \(p_{T}^{\text{jet}}\) regions, where both ungroomed and trimmed VR jet collections yield a superior performance compared to trimmed anti-\(k_{t}\)\(R=1.0\) jets, as already demonstrated in Section 6 for ungroomed VR jets.

The curves are obtained from the normalised distributions on the left by varying the value of a hypothetical lower bound on \(m^{\rm jet}\).

#### 7.1.2 Jet mass resolution

In addition to the performance for a one-sided (lower) bound on the jet mass, the performance of the VR and anti-\(k_{t}\)\(R=1.0\) jet collections is studied for a _mass window_ around the signal mass peak. This study is motivated by the observation that the tails of the signal and background distributions at high values of \(m^{\mathrm{jet}}\) are suppressed for VR jets compared to anti-\(k_{t}\)\(R=1.0\) trimmed jets, especially in the medium and high \(p_{T}^{\mathrm{jet}}\) regions, as indicated in Figures 7 (c) and (e). This trend is also observed for the mass distributions in \(hh\) (Section 7.2.2) and \(WW\) (Section 7.2.2) final states and will be discussed in further detail in Section 7.2.3. One may therefore suspect that the performance improvements for VR jets under a one-sided jet mass selection requirement are at least partly the result of the stronger suppression of the background contamination at large values of \(m^{\mathrm{jet}}\) rather than improvements in the signal mass region.

This assumption is tested by comparing signal and background contributions within a mass window around the signal mass peak. The mass window is chosen to be the smallest window containing 68% of the signal distribution, as defined in Ref. [37]. The widths and positions of the mass windows obtained for the different jet collections in the different \(p_{T}^{\mathrm{jet}}\) region regions are summarised in Tables 2 and 3, where the values for the upper edge and the full width of the windows are given, respectively.

In the low \(p_{T}^{\mathrm{jet}}\) region, a width of 90 GeV is obtained for both trimmed VR and trimmed anti-\(k_{t}\)\(R=1.0\) jets, compared to only 84 GeV for ungroomed VR jets8, indicating that the trimming procedure slightly deteriorates the signal mass resolution.

Footnote 8: The same width value is found for ungroomed anti-\(k_{t}\)\(R=1.0\) jets in this kinematic region.

In the medium and high \(p_{T}^{\mathrm{jet}}\) regions, the width of the mass window decreases for both trimmed and ungroomed VR jets while it increases for trimmed anti-\(k_{t}\)\(R=1.0\) jets. This behaviour can be understood from the mass distributions in Figure 7, which indicate that the larger width for jets with \(p_{T}^{\mathrm{jet}}<1.0\) TeV is mostly due to the larger fraction top quarks whose decay products are not fully contained within a single jet, as indicated by the \(W\) mass peak that is clearly visible in the mass distributions for trimmed jets in the low \(p_{T}^{\mathrm{jet}}\) region. This fraction decreases with increasing \(p_{T}^{\mathrm{jet}}\). At the same time, the higher rates of ISR and FSR, which are correlated with the scale of the momentum transfer \(Q^{2}\) of the hard process, tend to worsen the signal mass resolution. In the case of VR jets, this effect is suppressed due to their smaller catchment areas, while it has a noteable effect on the masses of anti-\(k_{t}\)\(R=1.0\) jets.

The superior mass resolution provided by both trimmed and ungroomed VR jets is particularly important with regard to searches for new, massive resonances that rely on identifying bumps in the invariant mass spectrum of their hypothetical boosted decay products on top of a falling mass spectrum from SM processes. VR jets could, for examples, improve the sensitivity of searches for massive resonances decaying to \(t\overline{t}\) where the reconstructed \(t\overline{t}\) invariant mass spectrum is searched for resonant excesses or deficits in the data with respect to the SM prediction, see for example Ref. [6].

The signal significances \(S/B\) and \(S/\sqrt{B}\) are given in Tables 4 and 5. They are calculated from the fractions \(S\) (\(B\)) of signal (background) jets that pass the mass window requirements in a given \(p_{T}^{\mathrm{jet}}\) regime. As in the case of the one-sided lower mass bound, trimmed VR jets out-perform trimmed anti-\(k_{t}\)\(R=1.0\) jets in the medium and high \(p_{T}^{\mathrm{jet}}\) regimes: The signal-to-background ratio \(S/B\) is increased by 37% in the medium \(p_{T}^{\mathrm{jet}}\) regime and by 63% in the high-\(p_{T}^{\mathrm{jet}}\) regime for trimmed VR jets compared to trimmed anti-\(k_{t}\)\(R=1.0\) jets. The corresponding increases in the signal significance \(S/\sqrt{B}\) are 17% and 24%, respectively. These performance improvements can be attributed to the narrower width of the 68% signal mass window for VR jets which results in a smaller the fraction of background jets in the signal region.

It should be noted that the decrease in the signal significance for anti-\(k_{t}\)\(R=1.0\) in the medium and high \(p_{T}^{\rm jet}\) regimes is both a result of the broadening of the signal mass distribution as well as the fact that background jets tend to be more massive for larger values of \(p_{T}^{\rm jet}\). The resulting shift of the bulk of the mass distribution of background jets is clearly visible in the comparison of Figures 7 (a), (c) and (e). This effect has been discussed in related studies, see for example Figure 1 in [38]. The effect of the larger background contribution due to this shift can also be seen in the case of VR jets where the signal significance in the high \(p_{T}^{\rm jet}\) region is slightly lower than in the medium \(p_{T}^{\rm jet}\) region, despite the fact that the width and position of the signal mass window are similar in the two regions.

As in the case of the jet mass (Section 7.1.1), trimmed VR jets behave similarly to trimmed anti-\(k_{t}R=1.0\) jets in the low \(p_{T}^{\text{jet}}\) regime. In the medium and high \(p_{T}^{\text{jet}}\) regions, both trimmed and ungroomed VR jets out-perform trimmed anti-\(k_{t}R=1.0\) jets.

The corresponding distributions are shown in Figure 7.

The performance of trimmed VR jets is identical to that of trimmed anti-\(k_{t}\)\(R=1.0\) jets in all \(p_{T}^{\text{jet}}\) regimes. The poorer performance of trimmed compared to ungroomed jets has been discussed in Section 6.1.3.

#### 7.1.5 Performance for simple top taggers

In addition to studying the performance of VR jets by imposing selection requirements on a single discriminating variable, the performance studies can be extended to simple top taggers that combine two or more discriminating variables to increase the tagging performance. Two such taggers, which are used in ATLAS, are the _Tagger_\(V\) and the \(W^{\prime}\)_Tagger_ studied in [6]. The Tagger V relies on the jet mass and the \(k_{t}\) splitting scales \(\sqrt{d_{12}}\) and \(\sqrt{d_{23}}\) as discriminating variables while the \(W^{\prime}\) Tagger combines a selection requirement on the first \(k_{t}\) splitting scale \(\sqrt{d_{12}}\) with requirements on the \(n\)-subjettiness ratios \(\tau_{21}\) and \(\tau_{32}\). The optimal working points of the two taggers are found by imposing fixed selection requirements on two of the three variables and varying an upper or lower bound on the remaining variable, following the procedure described in Section 7 of [6]:

* **Tagger V**: \(m>100\) GeV and \(\sqrt{d_{12}}>40\) GeV. Scan over \(\sqrt{d_{23}}\) (lower bound).
* \(W^{\prime}\)**Tagger**: \(\sqrt{d_{12}}>40\) GeV and \(0.4<\tau_{21}<0.9\). Scan over \(\tau_{32}\) (upper bound).

In Figures 10, the performance of trimmed VR jets (lines with markers) and trimmed anti-\(k_{t}\)\(R=1.0\) jets (broken lines) is shown for the Tagger V (left column) and the \(W^{\prime}\) Tagger (right column). In both cases, the performance curves for a number single variables, some of which have been discussed in previous sections, are shown for comparison. Again, VR jets are found to yield a significantly better tagging performance than trimmed anti-\(k_{t}\)\(R=1.0\) jets in the medium and high \(p_{T}^{\text{jet}}\) regimes, especially for taggers based on the jet mass and \(k_{t}\) splitting scales. It should be noted that the values for the fixed selection requirements have been derived for trimmed anti-\(k_{t}\)\(R=1.0\) jets and have not been optimised for VR jets. Hence further performance improvements can be expected from adapting existing taggers for VR jets.

In addition, the performance of the jet mass under the variation of a lower bound (gray) and the performance of \(\tau_{32}\) under the variation of an upper bound (magenta) are shown. Both the Tagger V and \(W^{\prime}\) Tagger are defined in the text. In the calculation of the corresponding performance curves the efficiency of the two additonal selection requirements for each tagger are taken into account, hence the maximum signal efficiency for these curves is smaller than 1.

#### 7.1.6 Summary

In this section, the performance of both _trimmed_ and _ungroomed_ VR jets has been compared to that of trimmed anti-\(k_{t}\)\(R=1.0\) jets for a number of relevant jet observables and combinations thereof. The performance of trimmed VR jets is identical to that of trimmed anti-\(k_{t}\)\(R=1.0\) jets and superior to that of ungroomed VR jets in the low \(p_{T}^{\rm jet}\) regime, where the size of VR jets is similar to that of anti-\(k_{t}\)\(R=1.0\) jets. In the medium and high \(p_{T}^{\rm jet}\) regimes, however, both ungroomed and trimmed VR jets out-perform trimmed anti-\(k_{t}\)\(R=1.0\) jets for the first \(k_{t}\) splitting scale and for both a one- and two-sided selection requirement on the jet mass. The performance of VR jets with and without trimming is almost identical in the high \(p_{T}^{\rm jet}\) regime, indicating that the source of the performance improvements for VR compared to anti-\(k_{t}\)\(R=1.0\) jets is the smaller jet size rather than the use of a trimming procedure.

### Performance in \(hh\) Final States

The performance of VR jets for the reconstruction and identification of boosted Higgs boson decays (\(h\to b\bar{b}\)) is studied for the jet mass as well as two substructure variables that have been found to perform particularly well in the identification of jets from boosted Higgs bosons decaying to \(b\bar{b}\)[8]: the ratio of the 2- and 1-subjettiness variables, \(\tau_{21}=\tau_{2}/\tau_{1}\), and the energy correlation ratio \(D2\)[39, 40]. Only the low and medium \(p_{T}^{\rm jet}\) regimes are studied.

#### 7.2.1 Jet mass

The findings regarding the performance of trimmed and ungroomed VR jets compared to trimmed anti-\(k_{t}\)\(R=1.0\) jets are in many ways similar to those for \(t\bar{t}\) final states (Section 7.1). In particular, notable performance improvements are observed for trimmed VR jets for \(p_{T}^{\rm jet}>1.0\) TeV, as shown in Figure 11.

The curves are obtained from the normalised distributions on the left by varying the value of a hypothetical lower bound on \(m^{\rm jet}\).

#### 7.2.2 Jet mass resolution

As in the case of \(t\bar{t}\) final states, the performance of VR jets is also studied for a mass window around the Higgs-boson mass containing 68% of the signal distribution, as defined in Section 7.1.2. The use of a mass window rather than a one-sided selection requirement on the jet mass is common in Higgs tagging [8] as it reduces the top-jet mistag rates of Higgs taggers.

The values for the full width and upper edge of the signal mass window are given in Tables 6 and 7, respectively. The resulting signal significances \(S/B\) and \(S/\sqrt{B}\), evaluated for the different jet collections in the respective mass windows, are summarised in Tables 8 and 9.

In the low and medium \(p_{T}^{\rm jet}\) regimes, the widths and positions of the mass windows for trimmed VR and trimmed anti-\(k_{t}\ R=1.0\) jets are identical. The corresponding values for \(S/B\) and \(S/\sqrt{B}\) are slightly smaller for trimmed VR jets. In the low (medium) \(p_{T}^{\rm jet}\) regime, the value of \(S/B\) for VR jets is reduced by 1.4% (11%). The corresponding values of the signal significance \(S/\sqrt{B}\), which is the more important measure with regard to the sensitivity of BSM searches, are only 0.5% (2%) smaller than those for anti-\(k_{t}\ R=1.0\) jets.

These differences in the performance of trimmed VR and trimmed anti-\(k_{t}\ R=1.0\) jets can be traced back to differences in the tails of the jet mass distributions, which are especially pronounced for anti-\(k_{t}\ R=1.0\) jets in the medium and high \(p_{T}^{\rm jet}\) regimes but suppressed for VR jets, as can be seen in Figure 11. The suppression of the high-mass tails corresponds to a slight increase in the fraction of background jets in the lower mass range, including the signal mass window. The origin of these high-mass tails is discussed in Section 7.2.3.

_Both_ the signal and background distributions feature tails towards large values of the jet mass, which are suppressed for VR jets compared to anti-\(k_{t}\ R=1.0\) jets. The fraction of background jets in the region \(p_{T}^{\rm jet}\gtrsim 150\) GeV, however, is larger than the corresponding fraction of signal jets. This leads to an improved signal-to-background ratio for VR jets in the high-mass region and explains the better performance of VR jets for a lower bound on the jet mass (Section 7.2.1) as opposed to a mass window requirement.

It should be noted that the observations regarding the high-mass tails also hold for the \(t\bar{t}\) (Section 7.1.2) and \(WW\) final states (Section 7.3.2). In the former case, the corresponding shape changes in the background distributions for VR jets are visible in the high \(p_{T}^{\rm jet}\) regime (Figure 7). However, they have a significantly smaller effect on the signal significance in the signal mass window which is close to \(m_{\rm top}\) and hence less susceptible to changes in the background mass distribution, which peaks at significantly smaller values of the jet mass. By the same reasoning, the differences in the signal significance for VR jets compared to anti-\(k_{t}\ R=1.0\) jets are expected to be larger for \(WW\) final states than for \(hh\) and \(t\bar{t}\) final states due to the smaller \(W\) boson mass. This case is discussed in Section 7.3.2.

#### 7.2.3 ISR contamination in the high-mass region

As noted in Sections 7.1.2 and 7.2.2, the tails in the jet mass distributions for both signal and background events are suppressed for VR jets compared to trimmed anti-\(k_{t}\,R=1.0\) jets with \(p_{T}^{\text{jet}}>1.0\) TeV. In Figure 12, this is illustrated for the signal mass distributions in \(hh\) events (solid lines).

The origin of the high-\(m^{\text{jet}}\) tails can be studied at particle level in events simulated with the Pythia MC event generator, for which particles originating from the ISR and FSR showers can be distinguished from those originating from the hard-scattering process via the particle status code [12].

study, jets containing ISR radiation are identified ("ISR-tagged") by requiring that at least one of the \(k_{t}\)\(R=0.2\) subjets after trimming does not contain a ghost-associated [41, 42]\(b\)-quark with transverse momentum \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>5\), but contains at least one ghost-associated particle from ISR.

The fraction of the mass distribution associated with ISR-tagged jets is illustrated by the dashed lines in Figure 12. These results indicate that the tails of the mass distributions for both VR and anti-\(k_{t}\)\(R=1.0\) jets are dominated by Higgs jets with contributions from ISR. The rate and energy of ISR increases with the scale of the momentum transfer \(Q^{2}\) of the hard process, resulting in more pronounced tails for \(p_{T}^{\mathrm{jet}}>1.0\).

These tails in the signal mass distribution lead to a loss of signal and a contamination of control regions in searches and precision measurements. With their on average smaller catchment area, VR jets are less vulnerable to contaminations from ISR, especially for events with high values of \(p_{T}^{\mathrm{jet}}\) where ISR is more dominant. Moreover, the increase in the jet mass depends crucially on the angular distance of the energy deposit from the jet axis. ISR contaminations in VR jets with small areas are necessarily at a smaller angle to the jet axis compared to those in anti-\(k_{t}\)\(R=1.0\) jets where the angles. Hence the mass increase due to ISR is smaller for VR jets on average.

Figure 12: The invariant mass distributions for Higgs jets are compared for trimmed VR (red) and trimmed anti-\(k_{t}\)\(R=1.0\) jets (black) in the low and medium \(p_{T}^{\mathrm{jet}}\) regions defined in Section 5. The distributions are shown for all selected Higgs jets (solid lines) and for Higgs jets that are ISR-tagged (broken lines), i.e. jets where at least one of the subjets does not contain a ghost-associated \(b\) quark, but at the same time contains at least one ghost-associated particle from ISR. The shoulder at Higgs jet masses above 150, dominated by contributions from ISR, is significantly reduced for variable-\(R\) jets for \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\gtrsim 1\). The core of the distribution shows a similar performance for both jet algorithms.

#### 7.2.4 First \(k_{t}\) splitting scale

The signal and background distributions for the first \(k_{t}\) splitting scale \(\sqrt{d_{12}}\) and the corresponding ROC curves for the variation of a lower bound on \(\sqrt{d_{12}}\) are given in Figure 13. As in the case of \(t\bar{t}\) final states (Section 7.1.3), notable performance improvements are found for trimmed VR compared to trimmed anti-\(k_{t}R=1.0\) jets for \(p_{T}^{\text{jet}}>1.0\) TeV.

The curves are obtained from the normalised distributions on the left by varying the value of a hypothetical lower bound on \(\sqrt{d_{12}}\).

#### 7.2.5 \(n\)-subjettiness ratio \(\tau_{21}\)

The conclusions regarding the performance of trimmed and ungroomed VR and trimmed anti-\(k_{t}R=1.0\) jets for the variation of an upper bound on the \(n\)-subjettiness ratio \(\tau_{21}\) are similar to those for \(t\bar{t}\) final states (Section 7.1.4). As illustrated in Figure 14, the performance of trimmed VR and trimmed anti-\(k_{t}R=1.0\) jets is identical for \(p_{T}^{\rm jet}<1.0\) TeV. Small performance improvements are observed for trimmed VR jets for \(p_{T}^{\rm jet}>1.0\) TeV.

The curves are obtained from the normalised distributions on the left by varying the value of a hypothetical upper bound on \(\tau_{32}\).

#### 7.2.6 Energy correlation ratio \(D2\)

The signal and background distributions for the energy correlation ratio \(D2\) and the corresponding ROC curves for the variation of an upper bound on \(D2\) are given in Figure 15. The conclusions regarding the performance of trimmed and ungroomed VR and trimmed anti-\(k_{t}\,R=1.0\) jets are similar to those for the \(n\)-subjettiness ratio \(\tau_{21}\) in Section 7.2.5. While the performance of trimmed VR and trimmed anti-\(k_{t}\,R=1.0\) is overall very similar, with a slightly better performance of VR jets for \(p_{T}^{\rm jet}>1.0\) TeV, ungroomed VR jets out-perform both trimmed jet collections. The reason for this behaviour is presumably the same as in the case of the \(n\)-subjettiness variables (Section 6.1.3), namely the fact that trimming affects the radiation pattern within the jet to which the energy correlations functions are sensitive.

The curves are obtained from the normalised distributions on the left by varying the value of a hypothetical upper bound on \(D2\).

#### 7.2.7 Summary

The performance of both _trimmed_ and _ungroomed_ VR jets has been compared to that of trimmed anti-\(k_{t}\)\(R=1.0\) jets for a number of relevant jet observables in events with two Higgs bosons decaying into two pairs of \(b\)-quarks. Significant performance improvements are found for trimmed VR jets compared to trimmed anti-\(k_{t}\)\(R=1.0\) jets in the region \(p_{T}^{\rm jet}>1.0\) TeV for one-sided selection requirements on the jet mass and first \(k_{t}\) splitting scale. Smaller improvements are seen for the \(n\)-subjettiness ratio \(\tau_{21}\) and the energy correlation variable \(D2\) in the same kinematic regions. Minor performance losses in the low and medium \(p_{T}^{\rm jet}\) regions are observed for a mass window requirement. These differences are found to be related to the fact that VR jets provide a better suppression of ISR contaminations compared to anti-\(k_{t}\)\(R=1.0\) jets. This finding, along with the performance improvements for other substructure variables render VR jets a promising alternative to trimmed anti-\(k_{t}\)\(R=1.0\) jets for the reconstruction and identification of boosted Higgs bosons decaying to \(b\bar{b}\).

### Performance in \(Ww\) Final States

The performance of VR jets in \(WW\) final states is studied for the same discriminating variables that were discussed in the case of \(hh\) final states (Section 7.2) as these variables have also been found to perform particularly well in the identification of jets from boosted \(W/Z\) bosons [38]. Hence the variables considered in the following are the jet mass, the first \(k_{t}\) splitting scale \(\sqrt{d_{12}}\), the \(n\)-subjettiness ratio \(\tau_{21}\), and the energy correlation ratio \(D2\).

#### 7.3.1 Jet mass

The performance of trimmed and ungroomed VR jets for a one-sided selection requirement on the jet mass is compared to that for trimmed anti-\(k_{t}\)\(R=1.0\) jets in in Figure 16. In the low \(p_{T}^{\mathrm{jet}}\) regime, the distributions for trimmed VR jets are identical to those for trimmed anti-\(k_{t}R=1.0\) jets, while notable performance improvements are observed in the medium and high \(p_{T}^{\mathrm{jet}}\) regimes.

#### 7.3.4 \(n\)-subjettiness ratio \(\tau_{21}\)

The conclusions regarding the performance of trimmed VR jets for the \(n\)-subjettiness ratio \(\tau_{21}\) are the same as those for \(hh\) final states (Section 7.2.5) with small performance improvements observed for trimmed VR compared to trimmed anti-\(k_{t}\)\(R=1.0\) jets in the medium and high \(p_{T}^{\text{jet}}\) regions. The poorer performance for trimmed compared to ungroomed jets has been discussed in Section 6.1.3.

The signal and background distributions for the energy correlation ratio \(D2\) and the corresponding ROC curves are shown in Figure 19. As in the case of the \(n\)-subjettiness ratio \(\tau_{21}\), small performance improvements for trimmed VR compared to trimmed anti-\(k_{t}\)\(R=1.0\) jets are found in the medium and high \(p_{T}^{\rm jet}\) regions, while the performance for the two jet collections is practically identical for \(p_{T}^{\rm jet}<1.0\) TeV.

#### 7.3.6 Summary

The performance of both _trimmed_ and _ungroomed_ VR jets has been compared to that of trimmed anti-\(k_{t}\)\(R=1.0\) jets for a number of relevant jet observables in event with two hadronically decaying \(W\) bosons. As in the case of \(t\bar{t}\) and \(hh\to(b\bar{b})(b\bar{b})\) final states, the discriminating power of the jet mass observable for a one-sided selection requirement is improved for trimmed VR compared to trimmed anti-\(k_{t}\)\(R=1.0\) jets in the medium and high \(p_{T}^{\rm jet}\) regimes, although the performance improvements are smaller compared to \(t\bar{t}\) events. In the case of a two-sided mass window, the performance of VR jets is slightly reduced compared to that of the trimmed anti-\(k_{t}\)\(R=1.0\) jets. However, as in the case of \(hh\to(b\bar{b})(b\bar{b})\) final states, the loss in signal significance is small and can be expected to be outweighed by other benefits of VR jets such as the better suppression of ISR and the performance improvements for the \(k_{t}\) splitting scale \(\sqrt{12}\), the \(n\)-subjettiness ratio \(\tau_{21}\), and the energy correlation variable \(D2\).

## 8 Conclusion

The VR jet algorithm yields jets with an effective size that decreases with increasing \(p_{T}^{\rm jet}\). This property renders it a natural choice for the reconstruction of hadronically decaying boosted particles, such as top quarks, Higgs bosons and \(W\) bosons, the decay products of which are typically merged into a single hadronic jet. Boosted objects are a key signature in a large number of searches for BSM physics as well as an increasing number of measurements exploring previously unaccessible kinematic regimes.

VR jets not only provide a more accurate description of the boosted object, the decay products of which are collimated into a detector region that is significantly smaller than the size of commonly used anti-\(k_{t}\)\(R=1.0\) jets at large transverse momenta, but their smaller size renders them less susceptible to contaminations from the UE and pile-up as well as ISR, yielding notable performance improvements in the discrimination against the background from QCD multijet events for \(p_{T}^{\rm jet}>1\) TeV for a number of relevant jet observables, most notably the jet mass and splitting scales. Boosted top, Higgs and gauge-boson taggers based on VR jets are therefore expected to out-perform equivalent taggers based on jets with a fixed \(R\)-parameter.
