* The measurement of jet production will allow to access small distances due to large cross-section.
* The statistical uncertainties will be small: A 30 fb\({}^{-1}\) integrated luminosity amounts to 4x10\({}^{5}\) events with E\({}_{\rm T}\)? 1 TeV, 3000 events with E\({}_{\rm T}\)? 2 TeV and -40 with E\({}_{\rm T}\)? 3 TeV.
* The expected statistics at large jet E\({}_{\rm T}\) values implies a desirable control of the systematic uncertainties to a precision better than 1% for E\({}_{\rm T}\) + 1 TeV and to -10% for E\({}_{\rm T}\) of -3 TeV.
* Systematic errors:
* jet algorithm (how to best define a jet),
* calorimeter response (jet energy scale),
* jet trigger efficiency,
* luminosity (dominant uncertainty 5% -10% ),
* the underlying event.

## 5 Photon Physics

Direct photon measurements can provide important constraints on parton distributions, especially on the gluon distribution in the proton. The advantage of photon measurements is the better energy determination in comparison to jet measurements, thus avoiding the jet definition ambiguities.

The expected ratio of the inclusive photon cross-section has a value of about 1.8 \(\rm{\times}\) 10\({}^{3}\).

A rejection larger than 3\(\rm{\times}\)10\({}^{3}\) can be achieved while retaining an efficiency of more than 00% for photons with \(\rm{E_{\rm{P}}}\)=40 GeV.

_Properties of Minimum-Bias Events and Hard Diffractive Scattering_

* A detailed understanding of the structure of minimum bias events is needed in order to reduce dependencies on models used to determine their effects at the design luminosity.
* Each minimum bias event is expected to contribute from charged particles only about 0.8-1 GeV per unit rapidity and unit azimuth to the transverse energy.
* An extension of the ATLAS detector in the forward region (beyond pseudo-rapidities of \(|\eta|\)=5) is presently under study, in order to increase the acceptance for charged particles from inelastic interactions (possibly including a momentum measurement) and to provide tagging and measurement of leading protons from elastic and diffractive interactions.

_Beauty production and QCD_

* _production measurements offer an important probe of pQCD_
* _Full NLO calculation available in QCD_
* _Tevatron single b production results show factor_ \(\sim\)_2 cross-section discrepancy between NLO QCD and data_
* _Tevatron has measured b-_b_ correlations
* _Whichare more sensitive to production mechanisms, however the precision was limited by statistics_
* _ATLAS at LHC will further contribute tests of QCD and investigate cause of theory-data discrepancy at hadron interactions_
* _The ATLAS detector performance is very good for these channels__Summary_

* The LHC will provide a big sample of events with high \(\rm p_{T}\) signatures for QCD studies. It will extend the kinematic range to larger values of \(\rm Q^{2}\), the hard scale of the partonic process, reaching scales of the order of TeV\({}^{2}\). The fraction of the proton momentum attributed to a parton will allow access to 10-5, while keeping the scale above 100 GeV\({}^{2}\), in contrast to HERA measurements, where these small momentum fractions are only reached for hard scales close to or even below 1 GeV\({}^{2}\).
* Candidate signatures to provide constraints on the quark and anti-quark distributions are the production of W and Z bosons via the Drell-Yan process as well as lepton pair production in general. On the other hand, the production of direct photons, of jets and of top quarks can be used to get information on the gluon distribution.
* The study of diffractive processes, which allow to access the hard and soft regime of QCD at the same time, presents a significant experimental challenge in the LHC environment and given the limited angular acceptance of the detectors.

Summary
* The high beauty production rate at LHC will allow one to extend b-production measurements up to transverse momenta of several hundred GeV. Correlations between b and \(\overline{\mbox{bb}}\) quarks and events with more than one heavy-quark pair, that were difficult to access in previous experiments due to limited statistics, will be investigated in detail.
* ATLAS can exploit the large statistics of b quark decays at the LHC to make precise b production measurements. Good prospects for measurements of b-b correlations in muon channels. Two exclusive channels studied so far: \(\mbox{B}_{\mbox{d}}\rightarrow\)J/\(\psi\)K\({}^{0}_{\mbox{s}}\), \(\mbox{B}^{0}_{\mbox{s}}\rightarrow\)J/\(\psi\)\(\varphi\) looking for additional muon.
* A precise knowledge and understanding of QCD processes is important for the studies of the Higgs boson(s) and searches for new physics beyond the SM, where QCD represents a large part of the background.
