This note presents a complete crosstalk map of the endcap calorimeter module 0. Results on test benches performed on mother boards (old and new), proven to be responsible of most of the crosstalk in Middle and Back samplings, are also shown.

Introduction

Module 0 of the Electromagnetic endcap Calorimeter (EMEC) has been stacked and cabled at CPPM during summer 99. The outer wheel (\(1.4<\eta<2.5\)) was half equipped with electrodes while the inner wheel (\(2.5<\eta<3.2\)) was complete. Apart from the physics runs, a constant and extensive calibration program has been performed (6.5 millions of events were recorded). This allows, among other things, for a global understanding of the crosstalk in the detector as well as in the electronic chain.

Crosstalk analyses have been already carried out on the calibration data recorded in 1998 on the barrel and endcap Modules 00, see Ref.[1]. Theoretical approach of various kinds of crosstalk was presented there, as well as some experimental results. The topic of this note is to present: _i)_ a detailed and updated view of the crosstalk in the endcap calorimeter and, _ii)_ a present status of the test bench measurement performed on mother boards (MB), believed to be responsible for most of the crosstalk in the Middle (S2) and the Back (S3) samplings.

This note is organized as follows: crosstalk analyses performed on the test beam data are presented in detail in the section 2. Test bench measurements are treated in section 3. Section 4 is dedicated to general conclusions.

## 2 Crosstalk measured in the beam test

After presenting some generalities about crosstalk measurements and a list of problematic single channels observed (section 2.1), we give a complete map of the crosstalk for the module 0 at liquid argon temperature. In the highly segmented part of the detector (the Front sampling, S1), the coupling capacitance between adjacent cells has a dominant contribution (section 2.2). Crosstalks from other sources were nonetheless found: \(i)\) ink resistors connecting the high voltage (HV) between S1 and S2 on the electrode (section 2.3), _ii)_ 'cold electronics' boards, especially for S2 and S3 (section 2.4), _iii)_ the rest of the electronics chain (section 2.5). Finally, an estimate of the crosstalk in physics is given in section 2.6.

### Generalities and singular channels

The EMEC module 0 contains 48 (31) electrodes in the outer (inner) wheel giving a total of 2000 connected cells whose repartition in S1, S2 and S3 is presented in Table 4 of Appendix 1. To perform the \(\phi\) summation and distribute the calibration, summing boards (SB) and mother boards are plugged on the electrode connectors. A map of these boards, the same as the ones used for module 00, is presented in Table 5 of Appendix 1. The front end electronics is shared between two crates called Standard (\(1.6<\eta<2.4\)) and Special (\(1.4<\eta<1.6\) and \(2.4<\eta<3.2\)).

To compute the crosstalk in the different samplings of the module, the following procedure is adopted:

1. Reconstruct signal and crosstalk shapes with the calibration delay runs taken in medium gain with DAC=100001. This choice allows to minimize the effect of the clock feedthrough coming from the calibration board [2]). To obtain a complete view of the detector, 12 types of runs were performed \(-\)4 configurations (labelled from 0 to 3) per sampling are necessary, see Figure 21 of Appendix 2. For all samplings, even configurations (0 and 2) pulse even calibration lines (0, 2,..., 126) and vice-versa for the odd ones. Footnote 1: This represents 32 runs and 160000 events.
2. Compute maximum amplitude, Amax, as well as the time at the signal peak, t\({}_{max}\), for the pulsed cells in these runs. Figure 1 shows Amax as a function of \(\eta\) for the 3 samplings. Amax and t\({}_{max}\) values serve as references to compute the crosstalk in each cell.
3. Calculate two quantities for the non pulsed cells: \(i)\) the peak to peak crosstalk (X\({}_{max}\)), where the maximum amplitude of the crosstalk signal is normalized to the maximum Amax and \(ii)\) the crosstalk under the peak (X(t\({}_{max}\))), where the crosstalk

Figure 1: _Maximum of the signal shape averaged over all \(\phi\), for all cells (G=Medium and DAC=10000). OW (IW) means Outer (Inner) wheel._

at the signal peak (t\({}_{max}\)) is divided by Amax2. Unless state otherwise, no gain ratio are applied (amplitudes are in ADC counts) in this study.

Footnote 2: X(t\({}_{max}\)) is the most relevant quantity for the physics.

Before starting with the crosstalk study, we classify problematic channels with respect to their Amax values in different categories:

* Dead in calibration (24 channels, 1.2%): one calibration line pulsing S3 cells of the inner wheel was dead on the board resulting in 6 non calibrated cells. For the other channels, the problem was not traced back. For some, the cell is also dead in physics.
* Dead in physics (57 channels, 2.7%): these channels show a low peaking time (\(\sim\) 30 ns) and a higher amplitude in calibration, compatible with a zero detector capacitance; in physics no signal is observed, enforcing this interpretation. Channels concerned are concentrated in the region \(\eta=2.2\)-2.4 \(\phi=14\)-19 in S2 and S3. Most likely the problem comes from a bad contact between summing and mother boards (mother board badly plugged?). This kind of problem can be detected during electrical tests, which were not performed on the module 0.
* Short circuits (29 channels, 1.5%): in the strips (19 channels), most of the short circuits can be traced back to a problem on the electrodes; in S2 and S3, two types of mistakes are responsible of short circuits: \(i)\) bad soldering on summing boards, \(ii)\) deficient resistance networks on mother boards. Systematic checks will be performed on these boards during the production to avoid such kind of problems.

Figure 2: _Signal shapes in calibration for channels with unexpected shapes. A standard shape is also shown for comparison._

* High capacitive coupling\(>10\%\) (4 channels, 0.2%): it is expected in S1, at a level below 10% (see section 2.2). Nevertheless, some cells with high capacitive crosstalk are present in S2 and S3, both in physics and calibration. The reason for it was not identified.
* Signal with unexpected shape (16 channels, 0.8%): Figure 2 shows the signal shape for these cells. They can be divided in two categories: \(i)\)\(\phi=18\) in the S2, where the problem probably comes from the shaper and/or the preamplifier on the FEB and \(ii)\) all the others, where no explanation was found to explain the distortion of these shapes.

The complete list of these cells is presented in Tables 6 and 7 of Appendix 3, for S1 and S2/S3, respectively. In total, 130 problematic cells (6.5%) were identified.

We divide the study of the non problematic channels in two parts:

1. Crosstalk in the same sampling as the pulsed channel: in this case, the relevant information is the crosstalk in the cell located at the right (or left)3 side in \(\eta\) (or \(\phi\)) of the pulsed channel. Indeed in physics, a cluster (group of adjacent cells in \(\eta\) and \(\phi\) surrounding the cell with maximum energy deposit) is formed in each sampling to reconstruct the energy. Footnote 3: In the following, we will choose right by default.
2. Crosstalk in different sampling as the pulsed channel: here, all cells of the pulsed sampling may affect differently the non-pulsed sampling. Thus, we have to look at all channels for each configuration.

To obtain a more general view of the crosstalk in the detector, we perform an average over \(\phi\), each time it is possible, i.e. when the crosstalk amplitude does not depend on \(\phi\).

### Capacitive crosstalk (S1 \(\rightarrow\) S1)

When S1 is equipped with strips (\(1.5<\eta<2.4\)), the main contribution comes from the coupling capacitive (\(C_{x}\)) between detector cells4. A theoretical computation has been carried out, for details see Ref.[1], and \(C_{x}\) is expected to decrease with \(\eta\), from 60 pF to 40 pF5. In this case, X\({}_{max}\) and X(t\({}_{max}\)) should also decrease with values in the range 7-10% and 3-5%, respectively.

Footnote 4: The cells before (\(1.4<\eta<1.5\)) and after (\(2.4<\eta<1.5\)) the strip region are expected to behave like S2 and S3 cells. We will not discussed them in this section.

Footnote 5: Detector capacitance values vary from 100 to 150 pF depending on \(\eta\).

The results obtained with the module 0 are shown in Figure 3 for all \(\phi\) sectors (left) and averaging over \(\phi\) (right). Amplitudes are computed for the neighboring cell in \(\eta\) (located on the right of the pulsed cell). Crosstalk peak to peak values are in the range 5-9% and 2-5% for the crosstalk under the peak. This is somewhat lower than what is expected. The (expected) drop of crosstalk amplitude after channel number 125 corresponds to the change in strip lengths at \(\eta=1.9\).

Figure 4: _Shapes of the crosstalk in S1 on the right of the pulsed channel. The vertical lines show the time of the maximum amplitude when these cells are pulsed. In parenthesis, one can read the (\(\eta\),\(\phi\)) values of the cell._

Figure 3: _Crosstalk amplitudes on the right of the pulsed cell for all \(\phi\) separately (left) and averaged on \(\phi\) (right)._

One can see a systematic dip each 8/12/8 strips depending on \(\eta\) and for all \(\phi\)6. It corresponds to the following situation: the pulsed cell is located at the end of one mother board connector, and his neighboring channel in \(\eta\) is the first of the next connector. In this case no contribution from the summing board is expected. Figure 4 illustrates this effect for two different \(\phi\). We can notice that cells (\(\eta=92\), \(\phi=2\),3) exhibit the same capacitive shape as the other ones. Therefore, we can conclude that an additional capacitive crosstalk (\(\sim 2\%\) for peak to peak crosstalk and \(\sim 1\%\) for crosstalk under the peak) comes from the summing boards. No attempt was made to correct for this effect, also seen in the barrel module 0 [3].

Footnote 6: Systematic low value of crosstalk for \(\eta=1.6\) (channel 36) and \(\eta=2.4\) (channel 212) can be explained by the fact that Special and Standard cells were pulsed in two different runs - one calibration board is used per run.

We expect no dependence of the crosstalk amplitude as a function of \(\phi\). If this is the case for \(\eta<1.9\) (channel number 125), a clear difference can be seen between \(\phi=2\)-3 and \(\phi=4\)-5 for \(\eta>1.9\). In both regions, a slow decrease is expected and if this is the case for \(\phi=2\)-3, an increase is observed for \(\phi=4\)-5. As no variation of shape has been observed in the latter case, this effect is due to an increase of the coupling capacitance values. Simulation has already demonstrated that an offset between the 3 staggered layers forming the electrode can produced such an effect [1]. Indeed, the module 0 were stacked with electrodes produced in several batches by two different companies (CICOREL and MCB), see Table 1. One can see that \(\phi=2\)-3 (4-5) is equipped with a majority of CICOREL (MCB) electrodes. Thus, a direct correlation can be made with the difference of crosstalk amplitudes observed versus \(\phi\). This has also impact on the resistive crosstalk amplitude, see section 2.3.

Another interesting measurement is the crosstalk amplitude for a channel located 2 strips away from the pulsed channel. The results show the same profile versus \(\eta\) as the ones presented in Figure 4. Values are in the range 0.5-1.25% and \(<0.25\%\) for the crosstalk peak to peak and under the peak, respectively.

### Resistive crosstalk (S1 \(\leftrightarrow\) S2)

The resistive crosstalk (\(X_{M-F}=X\left(t_{max}\right)=X_{max}\)) due to the ink resistor on the HV side of the electrode, can be studied in detail when pulsing S1 (S2) and looking at S2 (S1) cells. Figure 5 shows the situation in both case. In the case where S2 is pulsed, only

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|c||c|c|} \hline \(\phi\)(S1) & CICOREL & MCB \\ \hline \hline
2 & 10(B2) & 2 \\
3 & 1(B1)+10(B2) & 1 \\
4 & 5(B2) & 7 \\
5 & 1(B1) & 11 \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 1: _Origin of the electrodes in the outer wheel; Bx means batch number \(x\)._strips located in front are concerned by the resistive crosstalk - when strips are not in front of the pulsed S2 cell, we still may expect a long distance crosstalk, see section 2.5. In the other case (S1 is pulsed) every S2 cells are sensitive to the resistive crosstalk.

#### 2.3.1 S2 \(\rightarrow\) S1

The value of this crosstalk is given by [1]:

\[X_{M-F}^{\,N_{el}}=\frac{V_{M-F}}{V_{F}}=25\times\frac{R_{cal}^{F}}{R_{cal}^{M }}\sum_{HV=1}^{2}\sum_{el=1}^{N_{el}}\frac{1}{R_{M-F}^{H\,V_{F}}\left(el\right)} \tag{1}\]

where \(V_{F}\) is the signal obtained by sending \(V_{cal}\) directly in S1 via \(R_{cal}^{F}=3k\Omega\). \(V_{M-F}\) is the part of the signal which flows in S1 when S2 is pulsed via \(R_{cal}^{M}=0.5k\Omega\). This occurs through the HV resistors between S1 and S2 (both on HV1 and HV2 sides), \(R_{M-F}\), and depends of the number of electrodes located in front of a pulsed S2 cell, \(N_{el}=6\) for one S2 configuration. We can then write:

\[X_{M-F}^{6}=150\times\sum_{HV=1}^{2}\sum_{el=1}^{6}\frac{1}{R_{M-F}^{HV}\left( el\right)}\sim\frac{150\times 12}{R} \tag{2}\]

When a strip is in front of a S2 cell pulsed in configuration 0 and 1 (therefore, it is not in configuration 2 and 3), the crosstalk in this strip can be written:

\[X\left(0\right)=X_{M-F}^{6}+X\left(ot\,her\right)\ \ \ \ X\left(2\right)=X \left(ot\,her\right) \tag{3}\]

Figure 5: _Configuration patterns presented on the left (right) correspond to the case when S2 (S1) cells are pulsed. Full (dotted) lines correspond to cells located in the sampling (not) pulsed._

\[X(1)=X_{M-F}^{6}+X(\mathit{other})\ \ \ \ X(3)=X(\mathit{other}) \tag{4}\]

for the different configurations. We can then extract:

\[X_{M-F}^{6}=\left|X(0)-X(2)\right| \tag{5}\]

Analog computation are performed for a strip in front of a S2 cell pulsed in configuration 2 and 3. This is illustrated in Figure 6 for one strip. A clear resistive crosstalk can be observed after the subtraction of \(X(\mathit{other})\) in both configurations. To obtain a general view of what is happening per \(\phi\), we compute:

\[X_{M-F}^{12}=\left|X(0)-X(2)\right|+\left|X(1)-X(3)\right| \tag{6}\]

Figure 7 shows the results obtained for all S1 cells in each \(\phi\). As in the previous section, we are sensitive to the electrodes origin which vary as a function of \(\phi-\)lower resistance values for CICOREL than for MCB. We can also see 3 different zones corresponding to the different granularity (4-99, 100-147, 148-212). Even tiny effects are observed: for the region 4-99, where 8 S1 cells are in front of one S2 cell, the HV resistances at the border of the first and last strips are known to be greater than the other ones. Indeed, we see on Figure 7 a systematic decrease of the crosstalk value for these strips (\(X_{M-F}^{12}\sim 1/R\)).

Figure 6: _Crosstalk shapes in one S1 cell when S2 is pulsed with 4 different configurations (left). Extraction of resistive crosstalk (right)._

Inverse of resistance values7 measured at warm [4], before the bending of the electrode, and properly weighted (a global coefficient is apply for each \(\phi\)) are superimposed (red full triangle) on top of Figure 7. A very nice correspondence between warm and cold measurements can be seen for all \(\phi\) and \(\eta>\)1.6 (Channel number \(>\) 35). For \(\eta<1.6\), systematic higher values are observed for resistances, pointing out a possible effect occuring during the bending of the electrode.

Footnote 7: Typically resistances are hundreds of k\(\Omega\).

#### 2.3.2 S1 \(\rightarrow\) S2

By analogy to equation (1), we obtain for the crosst alk on S2 cells when strips are pulsed in one configuration:

\[X_{F-M}^{N_{e|}}=\frac{V_{F-M}}{V_{M}}=50\times\frac{R_{cel}^{M}}{R_{cel}^{F}} \sum_{HV=1}^{2}\sum_{el=1}^{N_{e|}}\sum_{\eta=1}^{N_{e}ta}\frac{1}{R_{F-M}^{HV }(\eta,\,el)} \tag{7}\]

and so:

\[X_{F-M}^{3}=8.3\times\sum_{HV=1}^{2}\sum_{el=1}^{3}\sum_{\eta=1}^{N_{e}ta} \frac{1}{R_{F-M}^{HV}(\eta,\,el)}\sim\frac{50\times\,N_{e}ta}{R} \tag{8}\]

Figure 7: _Crosstalk amplitudes in S1, when S2 is pulsed. All \(\phi\) are shown. The (red) full triangles represent the inverse weighted warm resistances._

\(N_{el}\) is the number of electrodes needed to form a S2 cell (\(N_{el}=3\)), and \(N_{eta}\) is the number of strips pulsed in front of a S2 cell (\(N_{eta}=2\) or 1 depending on the granularity ). By comparing the equations (8) and (2), we expect the crosstalk level to be at least 18 times smaller than in the previous section, thus typically of the order of 1 or 2 ADC counts. Unlike in section 2.3.1, there is no way to subtract the long distance crosstalk. Therefore, it was not possible to obtain resistive shapes for the crosstalk8.

Footnote 8: A non conclusive try have been made to subtract the long distance crosstalk from S1 \(\rightarrow\) S3 where the S3 cell is behind the S2 cell.

### Inductive crosstalk(S2 \(\rightarrow\) S2, S3 \(\rightarrow\) S3, S2 \(\leftrightarrow\) S3)

In this section, we review what concerns S2 and S3. The capacitive crosstalk coming from the electrode is expected to be of the order of 1%, more precisely \(\sim\) 1.5% for S2\(\rightarrow\) S2 and \(\sim\) 0.8% for S2 \(\leftrightarrow\) S3 [1]. However, it has also been shown in Ref.[1] that the dominant crosstalk contribution comes from the design of the summing and mother boards. The modifications introduced to these boards are discussed in details in section 3.

#### 2.4.1 S2 \(\leftrightarrow\) S2

Figure 8 presents the crosstalk shapes for some S2 cells located at the right side, in \(\eta\), of the pulsed cell. A second derivative shape can be seen with a crosstalk amplitude varying with \(\eta\).

Figure 9 shows the crosstalk amplitudes obtained for all S2 cells, in both wheels. Because of small crosstalk variation in \(\phi\) (\(\leq\) 0.5%) have been observed, the values are averaged over all \(\phi\). S2 channels can be associated by groups of 4, corresponding to one

Figure 8: _Crosstalk shapes in S2 on the right of the pulsed channel for the outer (left) and the inner (right) wheel. In parenthesis, one can read the (\(\eta\), \(\phi\)) values of the cell._

summing board (\(\Delta\eta=0.1\), vertical dotted lines on the plot), with crosstalk amplitudes depending on \(\eta\) channel position on the mother board (see section 3 for more details). Values are below 4% for the peak to peak crosstalk and below 2% for the crosstalk under the peak, except for \(\eta=2.0\)-2.1. In this region no flap9 is present on the electrode. Grounding is thus not as good as in the other regions, which may explain this increase of crosstalk. This has been corrected in the version of the electrodes we will use for the production.

Footnote 9: kapton foil soldered on the electrode to ensure a better grounding of the absorber.

#### 2.4.2 S3 \(\leftrightarrow\) S3

Some crosstalk shapes are shown in Figure 10 for S3 cells located at the right side, in \(\eta\), of the pulsed cell. The shape is bipolar, and the fast rising peak seen in S2 is no more present. In contrary with S2, S3 is not sensitive to capacitive crosstalk, when S3 is pulsed. Odd-\(\eta\) and even-\(\eta\) have different amplitudes because of S3 configuration pattern, see Figure 11. Indeed, the read cell can be: \(i)\) part of the summing board where the cell is pulsed or \(ii)\) not in the same summing board as the pulsed cell. In the latter case, the cell is not sensitive to the crosstalk coming from the 'cold electronics', thus a lower crosstalk

Figure 9: _Crosstalk amplitudes in S2 on the right of the pulsed channel for the outer (left) and the inner (right) wheel, averaged on \(\phi\). Vertical dotted lines represent the separation between summing boards._

amplitude is expected10.

Footnote 10: Crosstalk then partially comes from the long distance crosstalk (\(\sim 0.3\%\), see Table 2) and probably the electrode (\(\sim 0.3\%\)).

Figure 12 shows the crosstalk amplitudes for case \(i)\) averaged over \(\phi\), in the outer and the inner wheel. Amplitudes in the outer wheel are of the order of 3-4% for peak to peak crosstalk, except for \(\eta=2.0\)-2.1 (see previous section), and \(<1\%\) for crosstalk under the peak. In the inner wheel, similar values are obtained for the crosstalk under the peak but peak to peak crosstalk is lower, \(\sim 1\)-3%.

#### 2.4.3 S2 \(\leftrightarrow\) S3

When cells are pulsed in S3 (S2) and the crosstalk measured in S2 (S3), it is natural to consider all channels pulsed for one configuration. Crosstalk shapes are similar to the ones presented in Figure 8 (S2 \(\leftrightarrow\) S2).

Figure 13 shows the crosstalk amplitudes obtained for S3\(\rightarrow\) S2 and S2\(\rightarrow\) S3 cases, in both wheels. To compare these values one should multiply S3\(\rightarrow\)S2 by 2 and divide S2\(\rightarrow\)S3 by 2. Indeed, calibration is injected through 2 different resistive networks: 0.5 and 1 k\(\Omega\) for S2 and S3, respectively. Taking these factors into account, amplitudes of S3\(\rightarrow\) S2 and S2\(\rightarrow\) S3 are comparable and about \(\sim 30\%\) less compared to the ones shows in the two previous sections.

### Long Distance crosstalk(S1 \(\leftrightarrow\) S3)

This section is dedicated to the study of 'long distance crosstalk', namely what occurs in the electronic chain after the mother board: pig tails, warm cables, calibration, FEBs,

baseplane. In the following, we will try to separate the different sources of this crosstalk.

#### 2.5.1 S3 \(\rightarrow\) S1

In this section, S3 is pulsed and S1 read. Figure 14 shows the results obtained for different groups of S1 cells at two different \(\phi\) and for all S3 configurations. Inverse resistive shapes are observed, with various amplitudes, i.e. different crosstalk contributions.

The calibration board output connector is known to have small contribution to the crosstalk, see Ref.[2]. For \(\eta=1.6\)-\(1.8\) (channels 49-62) no contribution from the calibration board is expected since the S3 calibration lines (12-15 and 76-79) are far away from the strip ones (0-3 and 64-67), see Table 8 of Appendix 4. Indeed, for \(\phi=2\) channels, amplitudes are below 1 ADC count and the crosstalk probably comes from the feedthrough. On the contrary, the \(\phi=5\) channels exhibit a high negative crosstalk value for even configuration (0, 2) when corresponding S1 calibration lines are of the same parity (in red on the Figure). This extra source of crosstalk is located outside the cryostat (feedthrough, warm cable and/or baseplane). As only calibration lines 64-127 on the Standard board are concerned, it may be due to a bad design of the calibration warm cable used (even lines). This will, of course, not be present in physics.

The calibration board contribution can be seen by looking at \(\eta=2.0\)-\(2.2\) (channels

Figure 15: _Crosstalk amplitudes in S1 when S3 is pulsed for configuration 2 (upper plots) and 3 (lower plots) for \(\phi=2\) (left) and 5 (right). Gain factor is not applied._

156-173). Here, S3 calibration lines (28-31 and 92-95) are close to the S1 ones (32-35 and 96-99). As expected, this mainly affects channels with the same parity.

The situation for all S1 cells is summarized in Figure 15. No crosstalk can be seen in the Special crate, \(\eta=1.4\)-1.6 (channels 0-35) and \(\eta=2.4\)-2.5 (channels 212-215), because calibration lines of S1 and S3 are far away, see Table 9 of Appendix 4. This is also the case in the Standard for \(\eta=1.6\)-1.8 (channels 36-99), except for even configuration of \(\phi=5\) as explained before. For \(\eta=1.8\)-2.4 (channels 100-212), the main contribution comes from the calibration board. Subtracting effects not coming from the calibration, we summarize the contribution to the crosstalk of this board in Table 2.

Red (black) is (not) when channels are pulsed by a calibration line of the same parity._

#### 2.5.2 S1 \(\rightarrow\) S3

A similar study was done for the crosstalk occuring on S3 when S1 is pulsed with the same conclusions. As an example, Figure 16 shows the crosstalk shapes for a group of S3 cells (\(\eta=1.8\)-\(2.0\)). Amplitudes and shapes can be directly compared to Figure 14 for channels 156-173.

### Possible impact on physics

The crosstalk observed in calibration runs have been reviewed. We have now to understand how it will affect the physics.

Capacitive crosstalk should be similar, even if it is more difficult to observe in physics. The resistive (S1\(\leftrightarrow\)S2) crosstalk, although still present, is around 0.1% and can therefore be neglected11. The long distance crosstalk (with no calibration and warm cable effect) is of the order of 0.02%, so similar conclusions can be drawn.

Footnote 11: Based on the results presented in Figure 7, one should take into account that only one S2 cell is pulsed (/4) and the gain ratio (/6). The maximum value of crosstalk is then: 3.5%/24 = 0.15%.

Because of inductive crosstalk coming from the 'cold electronics' boards, a distortion of the physics signal is expected in S2 and S3. Taking into account the decrease of cell size as a function of \(\eta\), one must reconstruct the energy in a 5\(\times\)5 cluster in S2 to avoid the lateral shower leakage. Figure 17 (left) shows the signal shapes of cells in such a cluster

Figure 17: _Physics shapes in S2 (left) and S3 (right) for E=40 GeV in high gain. In parenthesis, one can read the (\(\eta\),\(\phi\)) values of the cell; 5 \(\sigma\) noise cut have been applied._Figure 18: _Schematic view of a old (up) and new (down) endcap mother board (MB1). Filled (open) circles represent ground (signal) connections. Mx and Bx stands for S2 and S3 cell number \(x\)._

(\(\eta=2.1\)), for a 40 GeV electron beam. If shapes of channels located in a 3\(\times\)3 cluster seems not much affected by the crosstalk, this is not case for the other cells. Indeed a clear undershoot is visible there. This is the consequence of the crosstalk coming from cells with high energy deposit (the crosstalk is directly proportional to the energy). In S3, the situation is even worse, see Figure 17 (right). As electrons deposit most of their energy in S2 (\(\sim 80\%\)), S3 is directly affected by the inductive S2\(\rightarrow\)S3 crosstalk. We can see that all S3 cells are sensitive to the crosstalk (an undershoot is seen), even the central one. No attempt has been made, up to now, to correct directly for these effects in the physics analysis. However, when using the optimal filtering method [5] to reconstruct the signal, one can expect a reduction of the crosstalk contribution.

## 3 Crosstalk measured on the test bench

Main contribution to the crosstalk in S2 and S3 are due to the 'cold electronics' boards, and especially the mother board. Summing boards contribution is not reviewed here.

A view of a 'old' mother board is shown in Figure 18 (up) Intensive testing of these mother boards have been performed using a 'toy calorimeter' composed of precisely measured capacitances (C = 0.92 \(\pm\) 0.01 nF for S2 and S312), and a CR-RC2 shaper with 15 ns shaping time - as in the beam test. Resistors terminate all the non used channels (50 \(\Omega\) for calibration and 25 \(\Omega\) for signal).

Footnote 12: Detector cell capacitances varies in the range 0.5-1.2 nF and 0.4-0.6 nF for S2 and S3, respectively.

Figures 19 a)-d) show the crosstalk amplitudes obtained with these 'old' mother boards (used during this beam test). In S2, the crosstalk level (below 4%) and the (same) pattern each for 4 cells can be compared with the ones of Figure 9. No difference between mother boards are observed13. The shape, see Figure 20, is also a second derivative one. For S3, the level is lower (2-3% instead of 3-4%) and the crosstalk has the same shape as for S2 cells (and not the bipolar shape observed in test beam conditions). Figures 19 c)-d) for S2\(\leftrightarrow\)S3 crosstalk are similar to Figure 13, but crosstalk values are slightly higher. The good agreement between results obtained in test beam and test bench conditions, underlined the crucial contribution of the mother boards in the crosstalk of S2 and S3. Remaining differences between test beam and test bench can probably be attributed to summing boards and variation of detector cell capacitances. Looking in more detail on the mother board, one can distinguish 3 regions:

Footnote 13: Different types of mother boards are used depending on \(\eta\), see Appendix 1, Table 5.

* The 'MillMax' connector side (connection with the summing boards): here, the further the pulsed cell is from the ground, the higher the crosstalk. This is the dominant effect. Thus, configurations 2 and 3 in S2 give higher crosstalk as compared to configurations 0 and 1. This also explain the pattern each for 4 (2) cells in S2 (S3).
* The calibration sockets: cells located near these sockets can suffer from mutual inductance coupling.
* The low profile side (connections with harnesses A): cells (especially when located between 2 pulsed cells) are also sensitive to mutual inductance coupling.

Figure 19: _Crosstalk amplitudes, on the right (in \(\eta\)) of the pulsed cells, measured on the ’old’ mother boards: a) S2\(\rightarrow\)S2, b) S3\(\rightarrow\)S3, c) S3\(\rightarrow\)S2 and d)S2\(\rightarrow\)S3. These values have been averaged over \(\phi\). One should multiply S3\(\rightarrow\)S2 values by 2 and divide S2\(\rightarrow\)S3 by 2 for comparison._

Figure 20: _Shapes and amplitudes of the crosstalk in one ’old’ (upper plots) and ’new’ (lower plots) mother board, when the configuration 2 is pulsed in S2. Gain ratio between S2 and S3 is taken into account here. Channel 0-15 (16-23) are S2 (S3) cells. Note that the scale of the right upper plot is two times larger than the right lower plot._

New mother boards and summing boards have been designed and produced according to these conclusions, see also Ref. [1]. A view of this 'new' mother board is shown in Figure 18 (down), and main modifications are summarized below:

* Improvement of the grounding: ground and signal pins have been implemented alternatively on the MillMax connector side (i.e. no more redundancy for the signal), which also implied a redesign of all summing boards. On top of this, ground (directly coming from the absorber) is added at both end of the MillMax connector.
* Displacement of the calibration connectors and suppression of sockets for low profile connectors to avoid mutual inductance effect.

To be complete, one should mentioned that, for uniformity reasons, inductances, coming from the strip length in the summing boards, have been equalized per summing board [6].

In similar conditions, we measured the crosstalk on one 'new' mother board. Results are summarized on lower plots of Figure 20 and can be directly compared with the 'old' mother board (upper plots of Figure 20). We can see that the shape of crosstalk is different (bipolar shape with the 'new' boards) and the amplitude decreases by a factor of \(2\) to \(4-\) note the change of scale on the right plot as compared to upper plot of Figure 20, leaving the crosstalk from the mother board below \(1\%\). This level is now acceptable and these boards will be used for the production modules.

## 4 Conclusions

A detailed analysis of the calibration delay runs taken on the EMEC module 0, during the 1999 test beam period, has been presented. About 6% of singular channels has been observed and partly understood. Various types of crosstalk have been encountered. Mainly: capacitive for the strips, inductive for S2 and S3 and resistive between S1 and S2. In the last case, a comparison with resistive HV values measured at warm has been done and a good agreement obtained.

The amplitudes of the crosstalk under the peak and peak to peak are summarized in Table 3 for the outer and the inner wheel.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|c||c|c|c|} \hline Read & \multicolumn{3}{c|}{Pulsed layer} \\ \cline{2-4} Layer & S1 & S2 & S3 \\ \hline \hline S1 & 5-9 (2-5) &? & 0.02* \\ \hline S2 & \(<\) 0.15 & 1-4 (1-2)** & 1-3 (\(\sim\) 1) ** \\ \hline S3 & 0.02* & 1-3 (\(<\) 2)** & 3-4 (\(<\) 1)** \\ \hline \end{tabular} 
\begin{tabular}{|c||c|c|} \hline Read & \multicolumn{3}{c|}{Pulsed layer} \\ \cline{2-3} Layer & S2 & S3 \\ \hline \hline S2 & 1-3 (\(\sim\) 1) & 1-2 (\(\sim\) 0.5) \\ \hline S3 & 1-2 (\(<\) 1) & 1-3 (\(<\) 1) \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}

(*) Not taking into account the warm cable problem and the calibration board crosstalk. (**) Not taking into account the region \(\eta\) = 2.0-2.1._The crosstalk impact on physics has also been estimated. S3 is the most affected (inductive crosstalk from S2). Efforts to reduce this crosstalk (as well as the one in S2) have been made by redesigning the 'cold electronics' boards. Corrected boards have been tested and all crosstalk amplitudes are now below 1% (instead of 4% before).
