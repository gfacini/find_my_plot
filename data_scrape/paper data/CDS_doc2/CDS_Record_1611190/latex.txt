# Beyond-the-Standard-Model Higgs boson searches at a High-Luminosity LHC with ATLAS

The ATLAS Collaboration

###### Abstract

The ATLAS experiment at the LHC is in an excellent position to study possible extensions of the Higgs sector of the Standard Model. This note reports results on the expected sensitivity to some beyond-the-Standard-Model physics scenarios with 300 and 3000 fb\({}^{-1}\) of pp data at \(\sqrt{s}=14\) TeV. Three benchmark processes are studied here. The scenario of a gluon-fusion produced narrow CP-odd particle, \(A\), which decays to \(Zh\), where \(h\) is the Standard-Model-like Higgs boson discovered at the LHC, is motivated by two-Higgs-doublet models. The discovery potential for heavy Higgs bosons decaying to a di-muon pair is also explored. Finally, the projected sensitivity to heavy Higgs boson decays \(H\to ZZ\to lll^{\prime}l^{\prime}\), where \(l,l^{\prime}=e\) or \(\mu\), and with \(m_{H}\) in the range \(0.2-1\) TeV, is presented.

Introduction

The ATLAS and CMS collaborations announced the discovery of a Higgs-like boson in the summer of 2012 [1, 2] and since then significant progress has been made in understanding its properties [3, 4, 5]. One question that emerges naturally now is whether the Higgs sector is minimal, i.e. including only one complex doublet of fields, or extended. This question will be certainly an important part of the physics programmes of the LHC upgrade. In this note an ATLAS sensitivity study of processes motivated by extended Higgs sectors is presented, for integrated luminosities of 300 and 3000 fb\({}^{-1}\) at \(\sqrt{s}=14\) TeV.

A simple extension of the Higgs sector may include additional doublets or singlets of scalar fields. In particular, two-Higgs-doublet models (2HDMs) that include just an additional complex Higgs doublet have recently received a lot of attention by phenomenologists and experimenters [6]. Section 2 describes in detail their features. The sensitivity to a 2HDM-inspired signature is studied here, in which a CP-odd particle \(A\) is produced via gluon-fusion. The decay mode considered is \(A\to Zh\), \(Z\to ee/\mu\mu\), \(h\to b\bar{b}\), where \(h\) is the 125 GeV Standard Model (SM)-like Higgs boson. The details of this study are described in Section 3. The discovery potential of heavy Higgs bosons decaying to a di-muon pair, a rare decay found in some 2HDMs, is presented in Section 4. Extensions of the Higgs sector may include additional heavy states, which may resemble a heavy SM Higgs boson. To search for these additional heavy states, extension to higher masses of the existing SM-like Higgs boson searches is interesting. In Section 5 a projection of the sensitivity of the current searches for \(H\to ZZ\), \(Z\to ee\) or \(\mu\mu\)[3] is given. Finally, Section 6 is devoted to the conclusions.

## 2 Two-Higgs-doublet models

The SM Higgs sector is only constrained by the observational fact that \(\rho\equiv m_{W}/(m_{Z}\cos\theta_{W})\approx~{}1\). In general, extensions of the Higgs sector violate this property and thus require a certain level of fine tuned parameters to satisfy the experimental constraints. Extensions of the Higgs sectors that employ SU(2) doublets or singlets [6] satisfy \(\rho=1\) at tree level. The addition of another SU(2) doublet of fields to the Higgs sector is therefore one of the simplest extentions of the SM and defines a large class of models, which are collectively referred to as two-Higgs-doublet models (2HDMs). They include the minimal supersymmetric SM (MSSM) [7, 8, 9, 10, 11], axion models [12], and baryogenesis models [13].

The most general gauge invariant scalar potential that includes two Higgs doublets, \(\Phi_{1}\) and \(\Phi_{2}\), is given by:

\[V(\Phi_{1},\Phi_{2})=m_{11}^{2}\Phi_{1}^{\dagger}\Phi_{1}+m_{22}^{2}\Phi_{2}^ {\dagger}\Phi_{2}-(m_{12}^{2}\Phi_{1}^{\dagger}\Phi_{2}+\text{h.c})+\frac{1}{ 2}\lambda_{1}(\Phi_{1}^{\dagger}\Phi_{1})^{2}+\frac{1}{2}\lambda_{2}(\Phi_{2}^ {\dagger}\Phi_{2})^{2}+\lambda_{3}(\Phi_{1}^{\dagger}\Phi_{1})(\Phi_{2}^{ \dagger}\Phi_{2})\]

\[+\lambda_{4}(\Phi_{1}^{\dagger}\Phi_{2})(\Phi_{2}^{\dagger}\Phi_{1})+\left\{ \frac{1}{2}\lambda_{5}(\Phi_{1}^{\dagger}\Phi_{2})^{2}+[\lambda_{6}(\Phi_{1}^{ \dagger}\Phi_{1})+\lambda_{7}(\Phi_{2}^{\dagger}\Phi_{2})](\Phi_{1}^{\dagger} \Phi_{2})+\text{h.c}\right\} \tag{1}\]

The Yukawa couplings of the two Higgs doublets are such that tree level flavour changing neutral currents can be avoided by imposing a discrete \(\mathcal{Z}_{2}\) symmetry: \(\Phi_{1}\rightarrow-\Phi_{1}\). In the following, a potential with only soft breaking terms for such a symmetry is considered, i.e. \(\lambda_{6}=\lambda_{7}=0\). In addition, CP-symmetry conservation is assumed, from which it follows that all potential parameters are real numbers. After electroweak symmetry breaking and assuming that both doublets acquire a non-zero vacuum expectation value, there are in total: two CP-even bosons, \(h\) and \(H\), defined such that \(m_{h}<m_{H}\), one CP-odd particle \(A\) and two charged scalar particles \(H^{\pm}\).

The potential of Eq.( 1) has 8 parameters after imposing the softly broken \(\mathcal{Z}_{2}\) symmetry and CP-conservation. These can be expressed in terms of (1) the masses of the bosons, \(m_{h}\), \(m_{H}\), \(m_{A}\), \(m_{H^{\pm}}\), (2) the ratio of the vacuum expectation values of the two doublets: \(\tan\beta\equiv\upsilon_{2}/\upsilon_{1}\), where \(\upsilon_{1}\equiv<\Phi_{1}>_{0}\) and \(\upsilon_{2}\equiv\upsilon_{2}/\upsilon_{1}\). The Higgs sector is then defined as:

\[V(\Phi_{1},\Phi_{2})=m_{11}^{2}\Phi_{1}^{\dagger}\Phi_{1}+m_{22}^{2}\Phi_{2}^{ \dagger}\Phi_{2}-(m_{12}^{2}\Phi_{1}^{\dagger}\Phi_{2}+\text{h.c})+\frac{1}{ 2}\lambda_{1}(\Phi_{1}^{\dagger}\Phi_{1})^{2}+\frac{1}{2}\lambda_{2}(\Phi_{2}^ {\dagger}\Phi_{2})^{2}+\lambda_{3}(\Phi_{1}^{

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:3]

the Higgs potential, leaving only two degrees of freedom that can be chosen to be the pair (\(m_{A}\), \(\tan\beta\)), and that radiative corrections due to the supersymmetric particles are specific to the model.

The decay of the \(A\) boson may occur in a variety of channels depending on couplings and phase space. Decays to fermions like \(A\to\tau\tau/\mu\mu\) have been already studied in the context of MSSM Higgs searches [16, 17, 18]. In the framework of the MSSM, these searches exclude the full region \(\tan\beta>5\) for \(m_{A}<300\) GeV, but for higher \(m_{A}\) their sensitivity decreases. In more general 2HDMs, many decays involving a boson in the final state become available, e.g. \(A\to Zh,ZH,WH^{\pm}\), depending also on the masses of the other Higgs bosons. In the study described in Section 3, the \(A\to Zh\) decay has been chosen, due to the simplicity of the final state. The \(AZh\) vertex factor in 2HDMs is type-independent and proportional to \(\cos(\beta-\alpha)\). This channel is, in general, the dominant decay mode of \(A\) in any 2HDM when \(m_{A}\) is above the \(Zh\) kinematic threshold \(m_{h}+m_{Z}\) and below \(2m_{\rm top}\) and it is more relevant at low \(\tan\beta\). The branching ratios BR(\(A\to Zh\)) are calculated with 2HDMC 1.41 [19]. An example of the BR(\(A\to Zh\)) for type-I 2HDMs, \(\sin(\beta-\alpha)=0.99\) and \(\tan\beta=1\) is shown as a function of \(m_{A}\) in Fig. 1 right. For this calculation, as well as for all 2HDM interpretations of the results of this study, \(m_{A}=m_{H}=m_{H^{\pm}}\) and \(m_{h}=125\) GeV are assumed.

The \(A\to Zh\) search results are interpreted in type-I and type-II 2HDMs, where the potential parameter that softly breaks the \(\mathcal{Z}_{2}\) symmetry is chosen to be \(m_{12}^{2}=m_{A}^{2}\tan\beta/(1+\tan^{2}\beta)\). The study focuses on the SM-like limit of the 2HDM and hence values of \(\sin(\beta-\alpha)\) close to unity are selected.

The \(\phi\to\mu\mu\) search results, described in Section 4, can be interpreted in the \(m_{h}^{max}\) scenario of the MSSM [20] with \(\mu=200\) GeV, where \(\mu\) denotes the Higgsino mass parameter. In this case, \(\phi\) refers to both \(A\) and \(H\), which are essentially degenerate in mass for the parameter region relevant to this study. This decay mode is relevant in the high \(\tan\beta\) region, and hence complementary to the \(A\to Zh\) search. The cross sections for gluon-fusion and \(b\)-associated production, the branching ratios, and the Higgs boson and sparticle mass spectrums are calculated in this scenario according to Ref. [21]. The cross section for the \(b\)-associated production is calculated in the five-flavour scheme described in Ref. [22]. The cross section times branching ratio for \(\phi\to\mu\mu\) as a function of \(m_{\phi}\) is shown in Fig. 2 for several \(\tan\beta\) values. In this figure, the cross sections of both production mechanisms and for both Higgs bosons (\(H,A\)) are added.

## 3 Search for \(A\to Zh\) with \(Z\to ll\) and \(h\to b\bar{b}\)

The decay channel \(A\to Zh\to llbb\) (with \(l=e,\mu\)) provides a clean signature and a fully reconstructible \(A\) boson mass. Signal samples are generated using Madgraph5 1.5.11[23] for masses of the \(A\) boson spanning the range from 220 GeV to 900 GeV. A narrow \(A\) boson width, much smaller than the experimental resolution, is assumed. Parton showering is performed with Pythia 8.1[24]. A major SM background process for this final state is \(Z\) production in association with light and heavy flavour jets. Events for these processes are generated with Alpgen[25] with up to 5 partons in the final state for \(Z\) produced in association with light flavour quarks or gluons and up to 2 partons in the final state for \(Zbb\) production. The production of \(t\bar{t}\) pair events is done with MC@NLO[26]. Parton showering and hadronization for both \(Z\)+jets and \(t\bar{t}\) events is performed with Herwig 6[27]. Di-boson events containing two \(Z\) bosons are produced with Pythia 8.1 and the same generator is used for parton showering and hadronization. The theoretical cross sections at NNLO are used for \(Z\)+jets backgrounds[28], the approximate NNLO is used for \(t\bar{t}\)[29], and the cross section for ZZ is obtained at NLO from MCFM[30]. ATLAS searches for the SM \(Zh\to llbb\) channel[31] have shown that the multi-jet background is negligible after the full selection cuts, hence this background is not considered here.

Outgoing truth-level (i.e. from the Monte Carlo generator event record) electrons, photons and hadrons are clustered into anti-\(\mathrm{k_{T}}\) jets with radius parameter R = 0.4[32]. Samples using detailed GEANT4-based[33] simulations of the ATLAS detector[34] under the high pile-up conditions expected in the LHC upgrade phases have been analysed to estimate the selection efficiency and resolution of physics objects. The results of these studies have been used to smear the particle-level output after parton showering and hadronization[35, 36]. The study presented here has assumed an average number of interactions per bunch crossing of 140.

Objects that are used in this study are required to pass the following criteria3 :

Footnote 3: ATLAS uses a right-handed coordinate system with its origin at the nominal interaction point (IP) in the centre of the detector and the \(z\)-axis along the beam pipe. The \(x\)-axis points from the IP to the centre of the LHC ring, and the \(y\)-axis points upwards. Cylindrical coordinates \((r,\phi)\) are used in the transverse plane, \(\phi\) being the azimuthal angle around the beam pipe. The pseudorapidity is defined in terms of the polar angle \(\theta\) as \(\eta=-\ln\tan(\theta/2)\).

The cross sections for both gluon-fusion and \(b\)-associated production, and for both \(A\) and \(H\) bosons, are added. The calculation is made within the MSSM \(m_{h}^{max}\) scenario with \(\mu=200\) GeV. The masses of \(A\) and \(H\) bosons are almost degenerate for the parameter space choices shown in the plot. More information can be found in the text.

(55%) efficiency for the signal with \(m_{A}\) of 360 (700) GeV.
* Muons: \(p_{T}>25\) GeV, \(|\eta|<2.5\), this cut has a 56% (65%) efficiency for the signal with \(m_{A}\) of 360 (700) GeV.
* Jets: \(|\eta|<2.5\) and \(p_{T}\) cut such that the fake rate due to pile-up jets is less than 1% (41 GeV for \(|\eta|<2.1\), 77 GeV for \(2.1<|\eta|<2.5\)). This cut has a 42% (68%) efficiency for the signal with \(m_{A}\) of 360 (700) GeV. The same cuts are applied to \(b\)-quark jets in addition to the \(b\) identification efficiency (70%).

Events are considered as \(A\to Zh\to llbb\) candidates if they contain at least two same flavour, opposite-sign leptons (\(e\) or \(\mu\)) and at least 2 \(b\) jets. The di-lepton invariant mass is required to be in the range \(80<m_{ll}<100\) GeV. Similarly, the invariant mass of the two highest-\(p_{T}\)\(b\) jets is demanded to be in the range \(90<m_{bb}<140\) GeV. Finally, an additional cut is applied on the angular distance in the \(\eta\)-\(\phi\) space of the \(b\) jets (\(\Delta R(bb)\)) for \(m_{A}\geq 500\) GeV: \(1.4-0.001m_{A}<\Delta R(bb)<1.8-0.001m_{A}\).

The reconstructed mass of the \(A\) boson \(m_{A}^{\rm rec}\) is determined as:

\[m_{A}^{\rm rec}\equiv m_{llbb}-m_{ll}-m_{bb}+m_{Z}^{0}+m_{h}^{0}, \tag{2}\]

where \(m_{llbb}\) is the invariant mass of the system of the two leptons and the two \(b\) jets, \(m_{Z}^{0}\) is the nominal mass of the \(Z\) boson (91.2 GeV) and \(m_{h}^{0}\) is the mass of the light CP-even Higgs boson which is fixed to 125 GeV. Examples of reconstructed \(A\) boson masses after the full selection are shown in Fig. 3 for some signal assumptions. In the same figure, the \(m_{llbb}\) distributions are also shown, demonstrating the improvement in the resolution obtained by the use of Eq. (2). The \(m_{A}^{\rm rec}\) spectrum for signal and backgrounds after the full selection is shown in Fig. 4 for \(m_{A}=360\) and 700 GeV. In addition, the number of events for signal and background processes is shown in Table 2. In this table, the signal cross section assumption is 0.1 pb, as in the \(m_{A}^{\rm rec}\) distributions shown in Fig. 4.

The calculation of the expected sensitivity employs a binned likelihood function, which is the product over bins in the distributions of the reconstructed \(A\) mass for the signal and the background samples. The

\(\tilde{q}_{\mu}\) test statistic [37] is used to calculate 95% confidence level limits with the modified frequentist method known as CL\({}_{\rm s}\)[38]. For the discovery potential estimation the \(q_{0}\) test statistic has been used to estimate expected 5 \(\sigma\) significance contours. The asympotic approximation [37] is used to evaluate the probability density functions rather than performing pseudo-experiments. The systematic uncertainties have been conservatively approximated as a 30% uncertainty, uncorrelated among the different background and signal samples.

Upper limits on the production cross section times the branching ratio \(A\to Zh\to llbb\) are shown in Fig. 5. Limits on the 2HDM parameter space are shown in Figs. 6-7 in terms of constraints on the \(\cos(\beta-\alpha)-m_{A}\) plane for given values of \(\tan\beta\) and in Figs. 8-7 in terms of constraints on the \(\cos(\beta-\alpha)-\tan\beta\) plane for given values of \(m_{A}\). Similarly, the 5 \(\sigma\) countour for the significance of an excess in the presence of a signal is shown in Figs. 10-13.The hashed area indicates the part of the parameter space which is inaccessible theoretically. The theory constraints considered here include Higgs potential stability, tree-level unitarity for Higgs scattering [39] and perturbativity of the quartic Higgs boson couplings, as implemented in 2HDMC.

This study shows that the expected 95% confidence level upper limits for the cross section times branching ratio of a gluon-fusion produced \(A\) boson decaying to \(Zh\to llbb\) are in the range from 5 to 0.07 fb for the \(A\) mass range from 220 to 900 GeV and for 3000 fb\({}^{-1}\). The upper limits are \(3-4\) times larger when assuming only 300 fb\({}^{-1}\) in integrated luminosity. The sensitivity in the \(\cos(\beta-\alpha)-m_{A}\) plane reaches its maximum at \(m_{A}\sim 340\) GeV, i.e. just below the \(t\bar{t}\) decay channel threshold, and for 3000 fb\({}^{-1}\), it is up to \(\cos(\beta-\alpha)\sim 0.0025\) with \(\tan\beta\sim 1\) for both 2HDM types considered here. This limit is

in the region where the gluon-fusion production cross section for a \(h\) boson followed by the decay into vector bosons differs from the expectation for a SM Higgs boson by less than 0.1%. The reach in the 2HDM parameter space for 300 fb\({}^{-1}\) deteriorates to \(\cos(\beta-\alpha)\sim 0.005\) for \(m_{A}\sim 340\) GeV and \(\tan\beta\sim 1\). Similar conclusions can be drawn for the 5 \(\sigma\) discovery potential, where the maximum discovery reach in \(\cos(\beta-\alpha)\) is about 0.009 for \(m_{A}\sim 340\) GeV. The sensitivity and the discovery potential with 3000 fb\({}^{-1}\) are increased significantly at higher \(\tan\beta\) with respect to 300 fb\({}^{-1}\) due to the rapid drop of the gluon-fusion cross section as \(\tan\beta\) increases (Fig. 1).

The structures in the limit seen near 260 and 370 GeV are a result of the background shape, which can be seen in the left of Fig. 4.

## 4 Search for \(\phi\to\mu\mu\)

The decay channel \(\phi\to\mu\mu\), which experimentally can be reconstructed with very good mass resolution, is studied here in MSSM-inspired scenarios where the mass degenerate Higgs bosons (\(A\), \(H\)) are produced by gluon-fusion and/or in association with a \(b\)-quark pair. As in the previous section, particle-level quantities from the MC generators are smeared to emulate the detector performance.

Signal samples for both gluon-fusion and \(b\)-associated production mechanisms are generated with Madgraph5 1.5.7 for Higgs boson masses in the range 200 to 1000 GeV. Showering and hadronisation are done with Pythia 8.1. The SM background processes considered in this study are \(Z/\gamma*\to\mu\mu\) and \(t\bar{t}\). Events from \(Z/\gamma*\) production are generated with Madgraph5 1.5.7, followed by showering and hadronization with Pythia 8.1. Events from \(t\bar{t}\) production process are generated, showered, and hadronized with Pythia 8.1. The object definitions follow the prescriptions of Section 3.

Events are considered as \(\phi\to\mu\mu\) candidate final states if they contain exactly two muons with opposite charge. In addition, the events are split into two categories, in order to take advantage of the two different production mechanisms. The \(b\)-tag category requires at least one \(b\)-tagged jet in the event and the \(b\)-veto category none. Table 3 summarises the expected number of events in each category for the simulated background processes as well as for the signal under the assumption that \(m_{\phi}=700\) GeV and \(\tan\beta=40\). In Fig. 14 the di-muon invariant mass, \(m_{\mu\mu}\), distribution is shown after the full selection for the \(b\)-tag and the \(b\)-veto categories separately.

To estimate the sensitivity of this search, the expected significance of an excess in the \(m_{\mu\mu}\) distribution in the presence of a signal is evaluated. The \(q_{0}\) test statistic and the asymptotic approximation described in Section 3 are used. Only statistical uncertainties are considered for these results. Table 4 shows the expected significance in terms of the number of Gaussian standard deviations (\(\sigma\)) for 300 and 3000 fb\({}^{-1}\), separately for the \(b\)-tag and the \(b\)-veto categories for various points in the MSSM \(m_{h}^{max}\) parameter space. The 5 \(\sigma\) contours of the expected significance in the MSSM parameter space are shown in Fig. 15 for each category separately and in Fig. 16 for the statistical combination of both categories. The results of this study show sizeable improvement of the discovery potential when the integrated luminosity increases from 300 to 3000 fb\({}^{-1}\), especially for large Higgs boson masses \(m_{\phi}\gtrsim 500\) GeV.

The signal corresponds to the assumption that \(m_{\phi}=700\) GeV and \(\tan\beta=40\) and event yields are quoted separately for gluon-fusion (\(gg\phi\)) and \(b\)-associated production (\(bb\phi\)) mechanisms. The notation \(Z/\gamma^{*}\)+jets refers to Drell-Yan production in association with jets from light quarks or gluons. Similarly, \(Z/\gamma^{*}\)+\(bb\) refers to Drell-Yan production in association with two \(b\)-quark initiated jets.

## 5 Projected sensitivity for \(H\to ZZ\to 4l\)

An estimate of the sensitivity of the search for a heavy Higgs boson decaying to \(ZZ\to lll^{\prime}l^{\prime}\), where \(l,l^{\prime}=e\) or \(\mu\), is obtained by projecting the current ATLAS results described in Ref. [3] to 300 and 3000 fb\({}^{-1}\) at \(\sqrt{s}=14\) TeV.

The selection described in [3] is applied to a heavy SM-like Higgs boson with a mass in the range \(200-1000\) GeV. The same systematic uncertainties as in [3] are assumed. The natural width of the Higgs boson is considered to be the same as for a SM-like Higgs boson with the same mass. The quoted cross sections for the gluon-fusion (ggF) and vector-boson-fusion (VBF) mechanisms, as well as the Higgs boson line-shapes, have been calculated with the complex-pole-scheme [40]. The interference with the SM continuum \(ZZ\) cross section is taken into account implicitly, by assuming an additional uncertainty in the \(ZZ\) production prediction as in Ref. [41]. Background cross sections where scaled to the higher \(\sqrt{s}\) accordingly to predictions obtained with MCFM [42, 43].

Expected 95% confidence level CL\({}_{s}\) limits are calculated for the ggF and VBF production mechanisms separately and are shown in Fig. 17. The limit plots assume that the Higgs boson is produced only through ggF production mechanism in Fig. 17 (a) and only through VBF production mechanism in Fig. 17 (b). In both plots the SM Higgs boson production cross section times branching ratio to \(4\ell\) is shown for comparison.

The expected upper limits are \(\sim\) 0.01-0.1 fb for ggF and \(\sim\) 0.008-0.04 fb for VBF production for the mass range from 200 to 1000 GeV assuming 3000 fb\({}^{-1}\) of integrated luminosity. Even with 300 fb\({}^{-1}\) the expected 95% confidence level exclusion in the absence of signal is about \(4-40\) times better than the prediction for an assumed SM Higgs boson in the same mass range.

## 6 Conclusions

The studies reported here have investigated the ATLAS sensitivity to various signatures for beyond-SM Higgs bosons using datasets corresponding to integrated luminosities of 300 fb\({}^{-1}\) and 3000 fb\({}^{-1}\) at \(\sqrt{s}=14\) TeV. A 2HDM-motivated scenario has been examined, in which a gluon-fusion produced CP

The black line corresponds to the expected exclusion assuming an integrated luminosity of 3000 fb\({}^{-1}\), while the blue line corresponds to 300 fb\({}^{-1}\). The expected SM cross sections times branching ratio are also presented (red dashed line).

odd Higgs boson, \(A\), decays to \(A\to Zh\to llbb\). Sensitivities to cross sections times branching ratios from 5 to 0.07 fb for an \(A\) mass in the range from 220 to 900 GeV have been reported for an integrated luminosity of 3000 fb\({}^{-1}\). The results obtained are improved by a factor of 3 to 4 with respect to the upper limit assuming 300 fb\({}^{-1}\). The discovery potential for heavy Higgs bosons decaying to a di-muon pair has also been examined and interpretation examples have been shown in the context of the MSSM. The improvement due to an increased integrated luminosity from 300 to 3000 fb\({}^{-1}\) is significant, especially for large Higgs boson masses. Finally, a projection of the sensitivity for a heavy, SM-like Higgs boson with a mass in the range 200 - 1000 GeV decaying to four leptons has been presented. The expected exclusion in the absence of signal is about 10 - 150 times better than that expected for a SM-like Higgs boson in the same mass range for 3000 fb\({}^{-1}\) of integrated luminosity.
