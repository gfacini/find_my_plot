## Introduction

The thickness measurement of the lead plates, which enter in the construction of the electromagnetic barrel calorimeter module 0, exhibits small relative variations as we compare real thickness and nominal value [1]. This contributes to increase the constant term value of the energy resolution of the calorimeter. In order to reduce this contribution, a mathematical algorithm has been used to sort and pair the lead plates during the construction of the module 0 [2].

In this note, we estimate, by using a simulation of the module 0 (using DICE), the impact of the lead plate thickness variations on the constant term value of the electromagnetic barrel calorimeter energy resolution. We also estimate the lead plates thickness variations contribution to the constant term value of the module 0.

In the first section, we present our module 0 simulation (using DICE) which is largely based on the program written by G. Parrour and P. Petroff hereafter referred as "Parrour-Petroff" description and intended for module 0 simulation. Our main modification was, in order to take into account the effect of the lead plates variations, the modification of the absorber description.

In a second section we present the "dead material" and \(\phi\)-modulation studies for an "ideal" calorimeter (\(i.e.\), without lead plates thickness fluctuations).

In the third section, we present the simulation context and the different samples we consider in our analysis.

Finaly, in the last section, we point out our results on the study of the constant term evolution as a function of the lead plates thickness fluctuations. We also show the results for the module 0 using the real map of the lead plates thickness.

## 1 Module 0 design and implementation

In this section, we present the test beam experimental setup implementation in DICE as it was done in the Parrour-Petroff description; we have used the same implementation for our study. We also present the differences between the calorimeter module description made by G. Parrour and P. Petroff and our description.

### Test beam experimental setup design and implementation in DICE

The experimental setup used for the module 0 simulation (see figure 1) was designed by G. Parrour and P. Petroff. It takes into account all the volumes which enter in the test beam setup, _i.e._, the aluminum walls of the cryostat, the foam which is used to reduce the liquid argon thickness seen by incident particles, the preshower detector and the calorimeter module. Figure 2 shows the implementation diagram of all these volumes, and table 1 gives their descriptions as they were specified by the authors.

### Calorimeter module description for GEANT simulation

The Parrour-Petroff geometry is a precise description of all the volumes which enter in the composition of the module 0. The calorimeter structure and the volumes description are given in appendix 1; the ACCG bank which gives all the parameters entering in the calorimeter description is described in appendix 2. In this geometry, absorbers are designed as individual volumes made of a mixture, "thinabs" (for thin lead plates) or "thickabs" (for thick lead plates), which is a mixing of lead, stainless steel and glue.

Figure 1: experimental setup layout as simulated in DICE

Figure 2: experimental setup implementation in DICE

absorbers are described as an addition of two different volumes. Figure 3 shows this structure: lead plates (VVAR for 1.1 mm thick lead plates; UUAR for 1.5 mm) are inserted into "prep" boxes (CARN for 1.1 mm thick lead plates; DDAR for 1.5 mm) which are made of stainless steel and glue. The densities of these boxes mixtures depend of the theoretical lead plates thickness as it is shown in table 2. Then, for a thick lead plate, the density of the "glue+stainless steel" boxes is bigger than for a thin lead plate (due to the relative higher amount of stainless steel in the mixture).

The positioning order has been done, for the CARN volume (for example), as follow:

1. put DDAR in CARN (the volume occupied by DDAR is made of thinprep)
2. put VVAR in CARN (the volume occupied by VVAR is made of lead)
3. put UUAR in DDAR (the volume occupied by UUAR is made of lead)

The positioning for the CORN and CELD volumes was made in the same way. Using

this positioning order, we are ensured that the volumes get the right material in the right place.

With this simulation we are able to study the "perfect module" with no lead fluctuation. In that model, as the total absorber thickness is set, increading the lead thickness is equivalent to decrease the stainless steel plate thickness and not only the glue thickness. So, to study the lead thickness fluctuation, we adapted this simulation using 3 volumes instead of two to describe lead, prepreg and stainless steel. Using this geometry, we are able to modify the lead thickness, leaving constant the absorber thickness and the gap thickness.

## 2 Setup detailed study

We discuss here a radiation length (\(X_{0}\)) and absorption length (\(\lambda_{I}\)) detailed study of the simulated setup. We first compare the Parrour-Petroff geometry description, then we look at the contribution of the "dead matter" in front of the calorimeter. In a last part, we discuss the several calibration corrections we have to apply to the measured energy.

### Comparison with Parrour-Petroff description

In order to check for any bias in our geometry description, we made, in a first step, a comparison between the Parrour-Petroff geometry and our description where all lead plates are 1.5 mm and 1.1 mm thick. Figure 4 shows a comparison between both descriptions.

The results point out no major difference between both distributions. Figures 4.c and 4.d give \(\Delta X_{0}=0.04\) and \(\Delta\lambda_{I}=0.012\). The fact that absorbers are not homogeneous volumes in our description where incident particles see much more density materials when they cross the lead plates can certainly explain the observed differences.

After this check, we believe in our geometrical description and then, in the following, all the distributions shown will be obtained with our geometrical description.

### Setup contribution to the radiation length

In this section, we estimate the radiation length (and the absorption length) contribution coming from the setup design, in order to point out a \(\Phi\)-dependence of the correction we will have to apply to the data.

In the setup implementation, three different volumes can contribute to the increase of the calorimeter radiation length: the two aluminum walls of the cryostat and the foam volume in front of the calorimeter.

In section 2.2.1, 2.2.2 and 2.2.3 we present the contribution respectively of the walls, of the foam and all together. In order to do this, we had to sligthly modify the experimental setup as it is shown in appendix 3. The main result is the observation of a \(\Phi\)-dependence of the \(X_{0}\) amount coming from the "dead matter" in front of the calorimeter.

Figure 4: Comparison between Parrour-Petroff geometry and our description; top: radiation length a) and absorption length b) in Parrour-Petroff description (dashed surface) and our description (undashed) at \(\eta\) = 0.3; bottom : difference between both descriptions for radiation length c) and absorption length d).

#### 2.2.1 Aluminum walls contribution to the radiation length and to the absorption length

In this section, we present the contribution which comes from the aluminum walls. Figure 5 shows the radiation length and the absorption length seen by incident particles with and without the two aluminum walls.

Figure 5 shows a large contribution (between 1.1 and 1.3 \(X_{0}\), and between 0.25 and 0.3 \(\lambda_{I}\)) coming from aluminum walls. Due to geometrical effects, this contribution increases with \(\Phi\).

#### 2.2.2 Foam contribution to the radiation length and to the absorption length

In this section, we present the \(X_{0}\) and \(\lambda_{I}\) contributions coming from the foam volume. Figure 6 shows the radiation length and the absorption length seen by incident particles with and without the foam volume.

Figure 6 shows a smaller additive amount of \(X_{0}\) coming from the foam volume when one

compares it with the one coming from aluminum walls contribution. Added \(X_{0}\) at \(\Phi=0\). is a factor \(1.3\,\)bigger than at \(\Phi=0.4\). This \(\Phi\)-dependence is shown in figures 6.c and 6.d.

#### 2.2.3 Foam + walls contribution

In the two precedent sections, we have seen the "dead material" contribution (to the total absorption length and radiation length) coming from aluminum walls and foam volume individually.

In fact, we are interested in looking at the whole "dead material", _i.e._ aluminum walls and foam volume together. This is the purpose of the present section.

Figure 7 shows the radiation length and the absorption length with and without dead material in the front of the calorimeter.

As it could be expected, we observe a large \(\Phi\)-dependent contribution coming essentially from the aluminum walls.

Looking at figure 7.c, we observe \(X_{0}(\Phi\simeq 0.4)/X_{0}(\Phi\simeq 0.1)\simeq 1.3\). Such a result should be observed on the data energy distribution.

### Lead thickness dependence of the calorimeter response

As in the rest of this paper, we will be interested by the effect of lead fluctuation, we want first to remind the global effect of a change in the lead thickness. Using the simulation program for different lead thicknesses, it has been found that the signal loss due to an increase by 1% of the lead thickness is respectively 0.59%/0.47% of the nominal signal for a nominal lead thickness of 1.53 mm/1.13 mm. This study is described in details in [3].

Simulation and analysis procedure

In order to achieve the studies of dead materials in the Test Beam set up, we have studied within ATLSIM the structure of volumes implemented in order to identify the possible dead materials. Using ATLASIM, we have profiled the \(\phi\) distribution of \(X_{0}\) for different dead materials. Then, using the DICE framework we have generated several data files with or without the main dead material, i.e. the aluminum wall of the cryostat. We have simulated at \(50\leavevmode\nobreak\ GeV\) two samples with respectively \(4000\) events with the wall and \(3500\) without it.

After the dead material effect analysis, we have begun the study of lead thickness fluctuations. The simulation program used to simulate the lead fluctuation effect has a true description of volumes present in the EM Accordion calorimeter, namely one stainless steel volume, one prepreg volume and two lead volumes (one for each lead thickness). This simulation program was fully tested within the ATLSIM framework. As the real high precision data, coming from measurement of lead plate thickness achieved at Hall IN2P3 at Orsay [2], is showing thickness distributions with non-gaussian shape, we choose to implement in our simulation lead plates distributed using an uniform law. This law is well adapted to the Module 0 lead plate distribution which is presented on the figure 8. With that approach, our results enable to quote a conservative bound on the contribution of lead thickness fluctuations to the energy constant term of the EM calorimeter.

In order to achieve detailed studies of thickness fluctuations, we have simulated large samples of events for different energies and different amplitudes of thickness fluctuation. We used 5 energies, 20, 50, 100, 200 and 300 \(GeV\) and 5 fluctuation amplitudes, \(\frac{\sigma^{5}}{e_{th}}=0\%,\leavevmode\nobreak\ 1.118\,\%, \leavevmode\nobreak\ 2.236\,\%,\leavevmode\nobreak\ 3.354\,\%\,4.472\,\%\),where \(\frac{\sigma^{5}}{e_{th}}\) is the fluctuation of the mean thickness calculated over 5 consecutive plates. The number of 5 plates was determined because it is the number of plates over which an electromagnetic shower spreads most of its energy in the EM calorimeter. The fluctuation amplitude on the lead th

the real data acquired with the ultra-sound system implemented in Orsay and used when lead plates are stacked before being used in the calorimeter.

We have chosen to use large fluctuations to be able to extract the contribution of lead thickness fluctuation to the constant term from the total constant term itself with a limited statistics of few thousand events. For each \(\frac{\sigma^{5}}{e_{\mu\mu}}\) configuration, we have simulated about **12500** events given in the following table :

\begin{tabular}{||l|c|c|c|c|c||} \hline \hline Energy (\(GeV\)) & 20 & 50 & 100 & 200 & 300 \\ \hline \# of events & 4000 & 4050 & 1600 & 1600 & 1122 \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}

These events were simulated with \(\phi\in[0.1;0.3]\) at \(\eta=0.3\) which is in the 1.53 mm thickness region of the calorimeter. In fact, we have also done the same analysis scheme done at \(\eta=1.1\) which is the 1.13 mm thickness region. We won't describe this second analysis in details here as we followed the same way as for the \(\eta=0.3\) case. Nevertheless, we will quote the results in the dedicated section. The number of simulated events decreases with energy because the higher the energy the more secondary particles to be simulated, so the more CPU consumption. These events were produced by batches of 80 to 250 events each. For each batch, the plate distribution was changed in order to have a representative idea of what could be the constant term over the whole calorimeter made of 32 modules.

On top of these events, we simulated **8200 events** with the perfect geometry within a very restricted \(\phi\) (\([0.2;\,0.225]\)) domain to study the \(\phi\) modulation and obtain the correction function which is periodical over the full calorimeter. All together, we have simulated about **130 000** electromagnetic showers to make all the studies presented in this note. We used electrons as incoming particles. The simulation was done using the CCPN/IN2P3 computing power.

### Data corrections

Before doing a fine analysis on the contribution of lead thickness fluctuations, we have to be able to reconstruct the energy as better as possible in the calorimeter. As we wanted to extract a very precise physical effect, we used the setting of the Module 0 DICE simulation where the energy is distributed accordingly to the true lost energy given by _GEANT_ i.e. without using current maps around the electrodes to describe the true migration of electrical charges produced in the liquid argon to the kapton electrodes.

Our files were simulated without electronic noise and we worked without clustering. As we had one EM shower by event, we considered the sum of all the cells of the module to be the energy of the incoming particle. As we did not use any clustering, we used the \(\phi\) of the incoming particle given by the GEANT KINE bank.

#### 3.1.1 "Dead matter" contribution correction

Using ATLSIM, we have shown that the bigger contribution to energy resolution coming from dead material should come from the aluminum wall of the cryostat. We have analysed carefully how this contribution of dead material could be seen at the reconstructed energy level. The main result of this analysis is that the wall should give a very light asymetry in \(\phi\) in the test beam data. In the simulation, we have observed a relative normalisationof effect of about \(1.5\,10^{-3}\). The phi distribution of \(\frac{E_{exc}}{E_{gen}}\) is shown for electrons of \(50\ GeV\) with and without the aluminum wall of figure 9. The vertical scale is expanded since the whole scale of the plot is between \(\pm 5^{o}_{/bo}\). We see that the wall enlarges the shower initiation and so produces some lateral energy loss at the order of \(0.2^{o}_{/bo}\). Morevover, after a careful check, we conclude that the effect in the real Test Beam set up should be even smaller because the actual wall is slightly thinner than in the simulation model.

#### 3.1.2 \(\phi\)-modulation correction

The accordion shape was designed to have a perfect \(\phi\) symetry. But because of the impossibility to make very sharp bends with the lead, the compensation between the different lead thicknesses is not perfect and varies with \(\phi\). Since the non compensation pattern is periodical over the whole calorimeter, we have restricted the initial electrons to be in the range \(\phi\in[0.2;0.225]\) which corresponds to about 4 consecutive absorbers which is enough to see the periodical pattern. So we could have quite a large statistics per \(\phi\) bin without simulating a huge number of events. Figure 10 shows the \(\phi\) modulation of the integrated argon thickness along a small \(\phi\) range. Figure 11 shows in the upper left plot the residual \(\phi\) modulation of the radiation length over all the Module 0.

Figure 9: \(\phi\) distribution of \(\frac{E_{exc}}{E_{gen}}\) for (open circle) the module 0 without the cryostat wall and for (closed circle)the module 0 with the wall. The observed effect can reasonably be interpreted as follows : the wall opens slightly the showers when they are initiated in it and so the shape that is observed with the wall shows a very small leakeage effect that is not present without the wall. The \(\phi\) dependence of the reconstructed energy is then insentitive to the inhomogeneities of cryostat wall matter and we are only sensitive to an earlier showering due to the wall existence. This effect of the order of \(1^{o}_{/bo}\) is very small and should be hardly seen in the test beam data.

The middle left plot shows the ratio \(\frac{E_{exc}}{E_{gen}}\) as a function of \(\phi\). The comparison with the previous plot exibits the correlation between the two shapes. The \(\frac{E_{exc}}{E_{gen}}\) asymetry can be well fitted by the function :

\[\frac{E_{corr.}}{E_{meas.}} = f\left(\phi\right)=1+\mathbf{a}+\mathbf{b}\sin\left(1024\phi+ \phi_{\mathbf{0}}\right)\] \[+\sum_{i=0}^{63}\mathbf{A}\exp\left(-\frac{1}{2\sigma^{2}}\left[ \phi-\frac{1}{1024}\left(\phi_{\mathbf{0}}-\frac{\pi}{2}+2i\pi\right)\right]^{ 2}\right)\]

The fit parameters that we obtained for a \(\chi^{2}=1.3\) (for 48 points fitted) are :

\(\mathbf{a}=-0.1744\,5\times 10^{-1}\pm 0.15197\times 10^{-3}\)

\(\phi_{\mathbf{0}}=1.5446\pm 0.13561\times 10^{-1}\)

\(\sigma=-0.3754\,3\times 10^{-3}\pm 0.22050\times 10^{-4}\)

Discussing the geometry of the simulation, we have seen previously that the description of the absorber as a single volume with an average mixing of stainless steel, prepreg and lead was not giving the same number of \(X_{0}\) than the description with several volumes describing individually the lead plates and the prepreg+stainless steel plates. We used in the simulation the calibration constant coming from an analysis with the first configuration of volumes with electrons of 50 \(GeV\). Thus, it was predictable that these calibration constants would not be precisely the good ones.

As the calibration constant are only depending on \(\eta\) and as we shoot electrons only at \(\eta=0.3\), this appears on our data as an overall calibration constant that is taken care of by parameter \(\mathbf{a}\). So our \(\phi\)-modulation correction function corrects also for the calibration.

We did not use 20 \(GeV\) electrons to extract the modulation correction function because as it can be observed on figure 12, the linearity is not good for low energies. Using 20 \(GeV\) energy would have lead to a bad estimation of the normalisation factor of the correction factor discussed above. This reflects the fact that the setting of the calorimeter calibration was made to have the best energy resolution around 50-100 \(GeV\) as there is an interplay between the linearity at low energies and the constant term around 50 \(GeV\).

Figure 10: \(\phi\) modulation of the liquid argon integrated thickness. Comparing this plot with fig. 11 shows a nice correlation. The small shift in the \(\phi\) angle between the two plots is due to the fact that the present plot was derived from a technical drawing of a module for which it was not easy to define \(\phi=0\) in the same way as in the simulation program.

Figure 11: \(\phi\) modulation of radiation length in a part of a module. The top plots show respectively the modulation of the radiation length and absorption length as a function of \(\phi\). The middle plots show the energy response as a function of \(\phi\) for different energies of incoming electrons. The bottom plots show the remaining modulation after energy correction.

### "Ideal" calorimeter study

As a first step, we have investigated the constant term of the energy resolution for the module 0 with a perfect geometry, i.e. without any fluctuation of lead plate thickness.

#### 3.2.1 Results : constant term evolution

The aim is to have a constant term smaller than 5 \({}^{o}_{\!\!\!/\!\!\!\infty}\)[4]. First we study the value of the physical constant (i.e. without any clustering) coming from inexact compensation of the phi modulation.

We used electrons of 20, 50, 100, 200 \(GeV\) to extract the constant term. Indeed, 300 \(GeV\) electrons give an EM shower which leaks into the hadronic calorimeter. In our simulation of the module 0, we have no hadronic system, so it was not possible to correct for this leakage. Using these events would then lead to an overestimation of the constant term.

The result plot of the analysis is shown on figure 12. The extraction of the constant term was done in three steps :

1. Correction of the phi modulation,
2. for each energy, gaussian fit of the \(E_{rec}\) distribution to determine \(\frac{\sigma_{E_{rec}}}{E_{rec}}\),
3. fit of \(\frac{\sigma_{E_{rec}}}{E_{rec}}\) versus \(E_{gen}\) with a 2-parameters function : \[\frac{\sigma_{E_{rec}}}{E_{rec}}=\sqrt{\left(\frac{A}{\sqrt{E_{gen}}}\right)^{ 2}+\left(C\right)^{2}}\] where \(A\) is the sampling term and \(C\) the constant term.

The sampling term and the constant term for the "ideal" module were found to be \(A=7.89\pm 0.08\) % and \(C=0.26\pm 0.02\)% for \(\chi^{2}=1.02\).

## 4 Study of samplings with lead plates thickness fluctuations

The final goal of this note is to study the evolution of the calorimeter energy resolution constant term as a function of the lead plate thickness fluctuations. As explained in

Figure 12: energy resolution as a function of energy (left) for a module without lead plate thickness fluctuations; linearity (right) of the response as a function of energy([2],[1]), the correlation between the lead thickness fluctuation and the constant term \(C\) is very useful. We are interested in the evolution of \(C\) as a function of \(\frac{\sigma^{(5)}}{e_{th}}\) where \(\sigma^{(5)}\) is the standard deviation of the mean lead thickness averaged over 5 plates. \(e_{th}\) is the nominal thickness of a single lead plate. We used the 5 following settings of fluctuation \(\frac{\sigma^{(5)}}{e_{th}}=0\%,\ 1.118\,\%,\ 2.236\,\%,\ 3.354\,\%\,4.472\,\%\).

### Correlation between constant term and fluctuations

To reach this result, we have done for each value of \(\frac{\sigma^{(5)}}{e_{th}}\) the same analysis than the one explained for the "ideal" calorimeter (i.e. without lead fluctuations) except that we did the fit of \(\frac{\sigma_{Erec}}{E_{rec}}\) as a function of \(E_{gen}\) with only one parameter (the constant term \(C\)). The sampling term is taken to be the one obtained from the "ideal" case.

Figure 13 shows one example of fit corresponding to a thickness fluctuation of \(1.118\,\%\) whereas figure (14) presents the results obtained for the constant term evolution when different energy corrections are applied. The upper left plot shows the evolution of the constant term with the full analysis described applied. The upper right plot shows the result of the same analysis for which we just applied a sine correction function (of the same type as the one described in [5]) i.e. with no exponential correction. The bottom plot presents the result obtained when no energy correction is applied.

Each curve was fitted using the function :

\[C\ (\%)=\sqrt{\left(a\ \frac{\sigma^{(5)}}{e_{th}}\ (\%)\right)^{2}+\left(b \right)^{2}}\]

which is the expected error on a random variable which is a function of two uncorrelated random variables. This function fits the data well in each case. As far as the energy cor rection is better, the \(b\) parameter is decreasing as expected but the slope given by the \(a\) parameter is not modified within the errors. This shows that fluctuations of lead thickness and the residual constant term coming from a non perfect compensation of \(\phi\)-modulation are two uncorrelated sources of the energy resolution. The values of the parameters found in the different cases are at \(\eta=0.3\) :

\begin{tabular}{||c|c|c|c||} \hline \hline  & \multicolumn{3}{|c||}{Energy Correction} \\ \hline  & No & Sinus & Sinus + Gaussian \\ \hline \(a\) (\%) & 0.534 & 0.531 & 0.530 \\ \hline _\(\delta a\)_ (\%) & \(3.\times 10^{-3}\) & \(3.\times 10^{-3}\) & \(3.\times 10^{-3}\) \\ \hline \(b\) (\%) & 0.462 & 0.319 & 0.26 \\ \hline _\(\delta b\)_ (\%) & \(1.5\times 10^{-2}\) & \(1.9\times 10^{-2}\) & \(1.7\times 10^{-2}\) \\ \hline \end{tabular}

The results quoted above correspond to the use of 300 \(GeV\) events for which a part of the energy is leaking outside the EM-Calorimeter. Moreover, this effect is bigger than expected in our simulation made within the Module 0 test beam set up because there is no coil in front of the module, so electrons see about 2 \(X_{0}\) less than in the real atlas set-up. If we use only energies from 50 to 200 \(GeV\), the results are a bit better : \(a\) = 0.23 and \(b\) = 0.53 with errors of the same order as quoted above and a \(\chi^{2}=0.97\).

At \(\eta=1.1\), the same analysis lead to a term \(b\) = \(0.44\pm 0.01\) whereas the sampling term is found to be 10.5%. This is a nice feature that the lead thickness fluctuation contribution is smaller in the 1.13 _mm_ lead thickness region than in the 1.53 mm region because the laminating process gives the same tolerance on laminated lead thickness unrespective of the nominal thickness. So the relative lead thickness fluctuations are bigger in the 1.13 mm region (\(\eta\in[0.8,1.4]\)) than in the 1.53 mm (\(\eta\in[0.,0.8]\)).

### Conclusion

First, the effect of dead material in the EM barrel test beam set up has been studied showing that no significant effect should be observed in the test beam data. Second, we have established the relation between the constant term and the lead thickness fluctuation which was found to be at \(\eta=0.3\) :

\[C(\%)\simeq\sqrt{\left(0.53\;\frac{\sigma^{(5)}}{e_{th}}(\%)\right)^{2}+ \left(0.26\right)^{2}}\]

The contribution from lead fluctuation at \(\eta=1.1\) (1.13 mm thickness region) is found to be 0.44 instead of 0.53 at \(\eta=0.3\) (1.53 mm region). Using these figures and the available thickness data taken at Orsay, the Module 0 constant term can be computed and we find that the contribution coming from lead thickness variations should be less than 0.3 %[2]. The contribution of lead plate thickness fluctuation to the constant term is in good agreement with an analytical calculation presented in [6].

We want to thank G.Parrour and P.Petroff who helped us to use the detailled simulation of the Module 0. We also want to thank S.Simion for his help to cross-check some of our Figure 14: Evolution of lead thickness fluctuation contribution and residual contribution to the constant term for different energy correction. As expected, the less corrected energy, the bigger residual constant term. Nevertheless, the contribution coming from lead thickness fluctuation is constant in each case showing that this effect is uncorrelated from the other one. The right-bottom plot correspond to \(\eta=1.1\) with no energy correction. The three other plots correspond to \(\eta=0.3\).

## Appendix 1 : The Parrour-Petroff description

In this section we present the calorimeter structure (see figure 15) as it was defined by G. Parrour and P. Petroff for their module 0 geometry description. In our geometry description, we have taken the same structure except for the CARN, CORN, CELD elements and their daughter volumes.

Tables 3 and 4 give the description and the materials used for each volume which enter in the calorimeter structure. Again, in our calorimeter description, we have used the same description except for the CARN, CORN, CELD elements and their daughter volumes.

## Appendix 3 : the testing geometry

In order to study radiation length and absorption length, we have used geantinos, GEANT's particles which return the number of \(X_{0}\) and \(\lambda_{I}\) they see when they cross matter. When using the Parrour-Petroff setup description, geantinos see all the matter which enter in the composition of the calorimeter plus the foam in its back. In order to cancel this unexpected contribution to the \(X_{0}\) and \(\lambda_{I}\) we had a new volume NFOA made of vacuum as it can be seen in figure 16.
