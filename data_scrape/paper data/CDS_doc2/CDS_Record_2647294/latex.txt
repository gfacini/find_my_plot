# ATLAS sensitivity to winos and higgsinos with a highly compressed mass spectrum at the HL-LHC

The ATLAS Collaboration

This note presents the prospects of two searches for direct chargino and neutralino production (\(\tilde{\chi}_{1}^{\pm}\tilde{\chi}_{1}^{\pm}\), \(\tilde{\chi}_{1}^{\pm}\tilde{\chi}_{2}^{0}\) and \(\tilde{\chi}_{1}^{\pm}\tilde{\chi}_{1}^{0}\)), in highly compressed mass scenarios, in proton-proton collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of \(14\,\mathrm{TeV}\). The first is a disappearing track search that investigates chargino production scenarios, where the chargino decays via a neutralino and a very soft pion, which is not reconstructed. The small mass splitting between the chargino and neutralino implies that the chargino has a significant lifetime and decays within the innermost tracking detector. The second is a two soft lepton search that investigates scenarios where the second lightest neutralino decays to the lightest neutralino and an off-shell Z-boson, giving rise to two soft leptons. The results of both searches are interpreted in pure-wino and pure-higgsino scenarios. The reach for these scenarios at the high-luminosity phase of the LHC with an assumed integrated luminosity of \(3000\,\mathrm{fb}^{-1}\) is presented and significantly extends beyond the current Run 2 limits of the respective analyses.

## 1 Introduction

Supersymmetry (SUSY) [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6] is a space-time symmetry that relates fermions and bosons, predicting new particles that differ from their Standard Model (SM) partners by a half unit of spin. In the electroweak sector, SUSY partners of the Higgs, photon, \(Z\), and \(W\) are the spin \(\frac{1}{2}\) higgsinos, photino, zino, and winos that further mix in neutralino (\(\tilde{\chi}^{0}_{1,2,3,4}\)) and chargino (\(\tilde{\chi}^{\pm}_{1,2}\)) states, also called the electroweakinos. In R-parity conserving scenarios [7], SUSY particles are produced in pairs and the lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP) is stable and is a dark matter candidate.

In anomaly-mediated supersymmetry breaking (AMSB) scenarios [8, 9], the supersymmetric partners of the SM \(W\)-bosons, the winos, are the lightest gaugino states. In this case, the lightest chargino (\(\tilde{\chi}^{\pm}_{1}\)) and the lightest neutralino (\(\tilde{\chi}^{0}_{1}\)), are both largely composed of the wino eigenstates and are nearly mass-degenerate. Due to this small mass difference, the \(\tilde{\chi}^{\pm}_{1}\) can have a long enough lifetime such that it decays inside the detector. AMSB scenarios naturally predict a pure wino LSP, which is a dark-matter candidate. However other scenarios, which follow from naturalness arguments [10, 11], suggest that the absolute value of the Higgsino mass parameter \(\mu\) is expected to be near the weak scale such that the higgsinos should be light, with masses below one TeV [12, 13], while the magnitude of the bino and wino mass parameters, \(M_{1}\) and \(M_{2}\) can be significantly larger, i.e. \(|\mu|\ll|M_{1}|,|M_{2}|\). This results in the three lightest electroweakino states, \(\tilde{\chi}^{0}_{1}\), \(\tilde{\chi}^{\pm}_{1}\) and \(\tilde{\chi}^{0}_{2}\) being dominated by the Higgsino component. In this scenario, the three lightest electroweakino masses are separated by hundreds of MeV to tens of GeV depending on the composition of these mass eigenstates, which is determined by the specific values of \(M_{1}\) and \(M_{2}\)[14]. Investigating either of these scenarios, with very small mass splitting between the lightest electroweakinos, is particularly challenging at hadron colliders, both due to the small cross-sections and due to the small transverse momenta (\(p_{\rm T}\)) of the final state particles.

The two searches presented in this note investigate electroweakino production in these two, nearly mass degenerate, scenarios assuming an integrated luminosity of \(3000\,\mathrm{fb}^{-1}\) collected with centre-of-mass energy \(\sqrt{s}=14\,\mathrm{TeV}\) proton-proton collisions at the High-Luminosity Large Hadron Collider (HL-LHC). The instantaneous luminosity of the HL-LHC is expected to be around \(L=7.5\times 10^{34}\,\mathrm{cm}^{-2}\mathrm{s}^{-1}\), leading to an average number of interactions per bunch crossing, \(\langle\mu\rangle\), of approximately 200, and these conditions will provide a very challenging environment for physics analysis.

The disappearing track search investigates scenarios where the \(\tilde{\chi}^{\pm}_{1}\), and \(\tilde{\chi}^{0}_{1}\) are almost mass degenerate, leading to a long lifetime for the \(\tilde{\chi}^{\pm}_{1}\) which decays after the first few layers of the inner detector, leaving a track in the innermost layers of the detector. The chargino decays as: \(\tilde{\chi}^{\pm}_{1}\to\pi^{\pm}\tilde{\chi}^{0}_{1}\), as shown in Figure 1 (left). The \(\tilde{\chi}^{0}_{1}\) escapes the detector and the pion has a very low energy and is not reconstructed, leading to the disappearing track signature, as shown in Figure 2. The latest ATLAS results for this scenario [15] using the 2015-2016 dataset of the LHC \(pp\) run at a centre-of-mass energy of \(\sqrt{s}=13\) TeV, excluded wino masses below \(430\) GeV with a chargino lifetime, \(\tau(\tilde{\chi}^{\pm}_{1})\), of \(0.2\) ns.

The dilepton search investigates final states containing two soft muons and a large transverse momentum imbalance, which arise in scenarios where \(\tilde{\chi}^{0}_{2}\) and \(\tilde{\chi}^{\pm}_{1}\) are produced and decay via an off-shell \(Z\) or \(W\) boson respectively, \(\tilde{\chi}^{0}_{2}\to Z^{*}\tilde{\chi}^{0}_{1}\) and \(\tilde{\chi}^{\pm}_{1}\to W^{*}\tilde{\chi}^{0}_{1}\). Considering the \(Z\to ee\) decay is beyond the scope of this note, but could further improve the sensitivity to these scenarios. Due to the very small mass splitting of the electroweakinos in this scenario, a jet arising from initial-state radiation (ISR) is required, to boost the sparticle system. Figure 1 (right) presents the scenario considered in this search. First constraints surpassing the earlier LEP limits [16] have recently been set by the ATLAS experiment [17], excludingmass splittings down to \(2.5\,\mathrm{GeV}\) for \(m(\tilde{\chi}_{1}^{0})=100\,\mathrm{GeV}\). Scenarios with direct \(\tilde{\chi}_{1}^{\pm}\) pair production are also considered.

## 2 ATLAS Detector

The proposal for the upgraded ATLAS detector [18] which will operate at the HL-LHC includes a new all-silicon inner tracking detector, the Inner Tracker (ITk) [19; 20], composed of five layers of pixel detectors and four layers of double-sided silicon strip sensors, allowing for the reconstruction of the trajectory of charged particles within a pseudorapidity range \(|\eta|<4\). The inner tracker is immersed in a \(2\,\mathrm{T}\) axial magnetic field, enabling the momentum measurement of the charged particles travelling through the inner tracker. The electromagnetic and hadronic calorimeters [21; 22] are located outside of the solenoid and provide high granularity energy measurements within \(|\eta|<4.9\). Beyond the calorimeters lies the muon spectrometer [23], consisting of a set of superconducting torodial magnets and three layers of gaseous chambers, allowing for the trajectories of muons to be measured up to \(|\eta|<2.7\). In addition to this fast detectors are also installed in the muon spectrometer for triggering purposes, with a range up to \(|\eta|<2.4\). The on-line trigger system will also be replaced by a new system, which will be capable of processing the rate increase anticipated at the HL-LHC. Both searches plan to use an \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\) requirement to accepting

events in the trigger, and the \(E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}\) selection used in the searches are expected to be in the \(E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}\) trigger plateau [24].

## 3 Monte-Carlo Samples

Monte Carlo (MC) samples are used to predict the expected backgrounds from SM processes and to model the SUSY signal scenarios under consideration.

The detector response is parameterised based on studies performed with Geant 4 [25] simulations of the upgraded detector in high luminosity conditions [18; 26]. All simulated events are overlaid with additional \(pp\) interactions in the same and neighbouring bunch crossings (pile-up) simulated with the soft QCD processes of Pythia 8.186 using the A2 set of tuned parameters [27] and the MSTW2008LO [28] PDF set. The pile-up conditions of the HL-LHC are assumed to follow a Poisson distribution with an average of 200 additional interactions (\(\langle\mu\rangle=200\)).

The disappearing track signals are generated assuming the minimal AMSB model with the ratio of the Higgs vacuum expectation values at the electroweak scale set to \(\tan\beta=5\), the sign of the higgsino mass term set to be positive, and the universal scalar mass set to \(m_{0}=5\) TeV. The SUSY mass spectrum, the branching ratios and decay widths are calculated using ISASUSY version.7.80 [29]. The \(m_{3/2}\) parameter is varied in these scenarios which allows the wino masses to vary and the LSP is expected to be a wino in these scenarios.

The higgsino simplified model used for the dilepton search includes the production of \(\tilde{\chi}_{2}^{0}\tilde{\chi}_{1}^{\pm}\), \(\tilde{\chi}_{2}^{0}\tilde{\chi}_{1}^{0}\) and \(\tilde{\chi}_{1}^{\pm}\tilde{\chi}_{1}^{\pm}\). The \(\tilde{\chi}_{1}^{0}\) and \(\tilde{\chi}_{2}^{0}\) masses are varied, while the \(\tilde{\chi}_{1}^{\pm}\) masses are set to \(m(\tilde{\chi}_{1}^{\pm})=\frac{1}{2}[m(\tilde{\chi}_{1}^{0})+m(\tilde{\chi}_{ 2}^{0})]\). It is expected that the mass splittings of pure higgsinos, generated by radiative corrections, are of the order of hundreds of MeV [30]. In the simplified models considered the masses of the \(\tilde{\chi}_{2}^{0}\) and \(\tilde{\chi}_{1}^{0}\) are varied independently while the \(\tilde{\chi}_{1}^{\pm}\) masses are set to the average value of the \(\tilde{\chi}_{2}^{0}\) and \(\tilde{\chi}_{1}^{0}\). The production cross sections are calculated as if the states were pure higgsinos.

The signal samples are generated with up to two extra partons in the matrix element using

MG5_aMC@NLO 2.3.3 [31] at leading order (LO) interfaced to Pythia 8.186 [32] for parton showering, hadronisation and SUSY particle decay. The NNPDF2.3LO [33] parton distribution function (PDF) set was used. Renormalisation and factorisation scales are determined by the default dynamic scale choice of MG5_aMC@NLO. The CKKW-L merging scheme [34] was applied to combine tree-level matrix elements containing multiple partons with parton showers. The scale parameter for merging was set to a quarter of the mass of the wino or higgsino depending upon the signal scenario. The A14 [35] set of tuned parameters with simultaneously optimised multiparton interaction and parton shower parameters was used for the underlying event together with the NNPDF2.3LO PDF set. The cross-sections for the disappearing track signals are calculated at next-to-leading order (NLO) in the strong coupling constant using Prospino2[36]. The cross-sections for the higgsino signal samples are calculated to next-to-leading order (NLO) in the strong coupling, and next-to- leading-logarithm (NLL) accuracy for soft-gluon resummation using Resummino v2.1.0 [37; 38; 39]. For both signal scenarios the nominal cross-section and its uncertainty are taken from an envelope of cross-section predictions using different parton distribution function (PDF) sets and factorization and renormalization scales, as described in Ref. [40].

Events containing a \(W\) or \(Z\) boson with associated jets (\(W\)+jets and \(Z/\gamma^{*}\)+jets) are produced using the Sherpa v2.2.1 generator with the NNPDF30NNLO PDF set at \(\sqrt{s}=13\) TeVwith up to two extra partonsin the matrix element. Diboson processes are generated at \(\sqrt{s}=13\)  using \(\mathrm{\textsc{Sherpa}}\) v2.2.2 with up to one extra parton in the matrix element. For the production of \(t\bar{t}\) the \(\mathrm{\textsc{Powheg}}\)-\(\mathrm{\textsc{Box}}\) V2 generator interfaced to \(\mathrm{\textsc{Pythia}}\)8 parton shower with the ATLAS A14 tune is used. The sample is generated at \(\sqrt{s}=14\)  and a parton level filter requiring \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}>\)100  is applied. The top-quark pair-production contribution is normalised to approximate next-to-next-to-leading-order calculations (NNLO) [41]. The NNLO FEWZ [42; 43] cross-sections are used for the normalisation of the inclusive \(W\)+jets and \(Z\)+jets samples. The expected diboson yields are normalised to the NLO cross-section from the generator. In addition, a series of dedicated "particle gun" samples are used for the disappearing track analysis to assess the probability of an isolated electron or hadron leaving a disappearing track in the detector.

## 4 Event Selection

The reconstruction of physics objects is performed at truth-level with parameterised detector functions [18]. Due to the different final states targeted by the disappearing track and dilepton searches, different requirements for the definition each object are applied.

The main signature of the disappearing track search is a short "tracklet" which is reconstructed in the inner layers of the detector and subsequently disappears. The tracklet reconstruction efficiency for signal charginos is estimated using fully simulated samples of \(\tilde{\chi}_{1}^{\pm}\) pair production with \(m(\tilde{\chi}_{1}^{\pm})=600\) with the HL-LHC pile up conditions. Tracklet reconstruction is performed in two stages. Firstly "standard" tracks, hereafter referred to as tracks are reconstructed. Afterwards the track reconstruction is then rerun with looser criteria, requiring at least four pixel-detector hits. This second reconstruction uses only input hits which are not associated with tracks, referred to as "tracklets". The tracklets are then extrapolated to the strip detectors, and any compatible hits are assigned to the tracklet candidate. Tracklets are required to have \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>5\) and \(|\eta|<2.2\). Candidate leptons, which are used only to veto events, are selected with \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) larger than 20 and \(|\eta|<2.47\) (2.7) for electrons (muons).

The dilepton search targets scenarios that contain low \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) muons selected with \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>\)3  and \(|\eta|<2.5\). Muons that originate from pile up interactions or from heavy flavour decays, referred as fake or non-prompt muons, are rejected by applying an isolation to the muon candidates. The main source of these muons is decays from heavy flavour mesons and baryons created in the quark hadronization process.

For both analyses candidate jets are reconstructed with the anti-\(k_{t}\) algorithm with a radius parameter of 0.4. They are selected with \(|\eta|<2.8\) and the jet energy is smeared according to a Gaussian. Jets are tagged as originating from \(b\)-decays (\(b\)-tagged) using a parameterisation (versus the jet \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) and \(\eta\)) modelling the performance of the MV2c10 \(b\)-tagging algorithm [19]. In simulated \(t\bar{t}\) events, the chosen working point identifies \(b\)-jets with an average efficiency of 70%, for a \(c\)-jet rejection factor of about 20 and a light-flavour jet rejection factor of about 750.

The magnitude of the missing transverse momentum (\(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\)) is computed as the vectorial sum of the true momenta (at the particle level) of neutral weakly-interacting particles (neutrinos and neutralinos). It is then smeared, according to a Gaussian, to simulate the detector response, with a function parameterised as a function of the average number of interactions per bunch crossing \(\mu\) and the scalar sum of energy in the calorimeter \(\sum E_{\mathrm{T}}\). The method to resolve overlaps is as follows: candidate jets are required to be separated from candidate electrons by \(\Delta R(e,\mathrm{jet})>0.2\); if a jet and electron are within 0.2, then the jet is removed and the electron is kept; after this step, leptons (both \(e\) and \(\mu\)) are removed if they are within \(\Delta R<0.4\) of a remaining jet.

For the disappearing-track search the final state contains zero leptons (\(e\), \(\mu\)), large \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\) and at least one tracklet, and events are reweighted by the expected efficiencies of tracklet reconstruction. The small mass splitting means events in which the \(\tilde{\chi}_{1}^{\pm}\) and \(\tilde{\chi}_{1}^{0}\) are produced back to back yield little \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\), hence, it is necessary to select events where the system is boosted by recoiling against one or more jets from initial state radiation (ISR). The minimum azimuthal angular distance, \(\min\{\Delta\phi(\mathrm{jet}_{1-4},E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}})\}\), between the first four jets (ordered in \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\)) and the \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\) is required to be greater than one, in order to reject events with mis-measured \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\).

Different kinematic variables are used in the search to separate the signal from the SM background, such as the leading jet \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\), the \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\), the leading tracklet \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) and the azimuthal angle (\(\Delta\phi(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}},\mathrm{trk})\)) between the tracklet and the \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\). The final SR selection is optimised using two signal models: one with \(m(\tilde{\chi}_{1}^{\pm})=800\) and a lifetime of 1 ns and the other with \(m(\tilde{\chi}_{1}^{\pm})=200\) and a lifetime of 0.04 ns. A minimum of three background events has been required in the optimisation process. Figure 3 shows the the \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\) and the leading tracklet \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) distributions in events passing the full SR selection. The dominant background in the SR is found to be from fake tracklets, similarly to the Run 2 version of the search [17]. The full SR selection is presented in Table 1.

For the dilepton search, only events with two opposite-sign muons are used in the final selection, as

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{l c} \hline \hline Variable & SR Selection \\ \hline Lepton veto \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) [GeV] & \(>\)20 \\ \(\min\{\Delta\phi(\mathrm{jet}_{1-4},E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}})\}\) & \(>\) 1 \\ \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\) [GeV] & \(>\) 300 \\ Leading jet \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) [GeV] & \(>\) 300 \\ Leading tracklet \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) [GeV] & \(>\) 150 \\ \(\Delta\phi(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}},\mathrm{trk})\) & \(<\) 0.5 \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 1: Summary of the search selection criteria for the disappearing track SR.

Figure 3: Kinematic variables for the disappearing track search: Left, \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\); Right, tracklet \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\). All figures contain events passing the full SR selection, aside from the selection on the variable under consideration. Two signal models are overlayed for reference, labelled by two numbers referring respectively to the chargino mass (in GeV) and lifetime (in ps).

the muon reconstruction rate is not expected to fall dramatically and the muon fake rate is not expected to grow largely with increased pile-up. The final SR selections are summarised in Table 2. These requirements select events where the SUSY system recoils against a high-\(p_{\rm T}\) jet from ISR. This motivates additional requirements on the leading jet of \(p_{\rm T}({\rm jet}_{1})>100\GeV\) and on the azimuthal separation \(\Delta\phi({\rm jet}_{1},E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss})>2.0\). In order to discriminate the signal from SM background processes, different kinematic variables are used such as the total number of muons in the event (\(n_{\mu}\)), the total number of jets (\(n_{\rm jets}\)) and \(b\)-jets (\(n_{\rm b\text{-jets}}\)) with \(p_{\rm T}>30\GeV\). The missing transverse energy (\(E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}\)), invariant mass of the dilepton system (\(m_{\ell\ell}\)), angular separation between the leptons (\(\Delta R(\ell,\ell)\)), invariant mass of two tau leptons (\(m_{\tau\tau}\)) (calculated as described in Ref. [17]) and ratio of the \(E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}\) to the scalar sum of the two leptons' \(p_{\rm T}\) (\(E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}/H_{\rm T}^{\rm lep}\)) are also used. Figure 4 presents a selection of kinematic distributions after the full SR selection is applied, minus the selection on the variable under consideration. The final SR definitions split the \(m_{\ell\ell}\) into six non-overlapping SRs, with \(m_{\ell\ell}\) selections of \([1,3]\), \([3.2,5]\), \([5,10]\), \([10,20]\), \([20,30]\) and \([30,50]\) GeV.

The leading sources of background in the SR are from \(t\bar{t}\), single-top, \(WW\) + jets, and \(Z/\gamma^{*}(\to\tau\tau)\) + jets. The dominant source of reducible background arises from processes where one or more leptons are fake or non-prompt, such as in \(W\)+jets production. The fake/non-prompt lepton background arises from jets misidentified as leptons, photon conversions, or semileptonic decays of heavy-flavor hadrons.

## 5 Background Estimation

MC simulated event samples are used to predict the backgrounds from SM processes in the SRs. Due to the differences in signal phenomenology between the disappearing track and dilepton searches, the main backgrounds and background estimation strategy differ between the searches.

For the disappearing track analysis, there are two main background contributions: SM particles that are reconstructed as tracklets, and events which contain fake tracklets. The SM particles reconstructed as

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{l c c} \hline \hline Variable & SR Selection (\(m_{\ell\ell}<20\GeV\)) & SR Selection (\(m_{\ell\ell}>20\GeV\)) \\ \hline \(n_{\mu}\) & = 2 & = 2 \\ \(p_{\rm T}(\mu_{1,2})\) [GeV] & \(>\) 3 & \(>\) 8 \\ \(n_{\rm jets}\) & \(\geq\) 1 & \(\geq\) 1 \\ \(n_{\rm b\text{-jets}}\) & = 0 & = 0 \\ \(E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}\) [GeV] & \(>\) 500 & \(>\) 500 \\ \(\Delta R(\ell,\ell)\) & \(<\) 2 & \(<\) 2 \\ \(m_{\ell\ell}\) [GeV] & \([1,20]\) excluding \([3.0,3.2]\) & \([20,50]\) \\ \(p_{\rm T}({\rm jet}_{1})\) [GeV] & \(>\) 100 & \(>\) 100 \\ \(\Delta\phi(j_{1},E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss})\) & \(>\) 2 & \(>\) 2 \\ \(\min(\Delta\phi(j,E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}))\) & \(>\) 0.4 & \(>\) 0.4 \\ \(m_{\tau\tau}\) [GeV] & \(<\) 0 or \(>\) 160 & \(<\) 0 or \(>\) 160 \\ \(E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}/H_{\rm T}^{\rm lep}\) & \(>\) max\((5,15-2m_{\ell\ell})\) & \(>\) max\((10,15-2m_{\ell\ell})\) \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 2: Summary of the SR selection requirements for the dilepton search.

tracklets are typically hadrons scattering in the detector material or electrons undergoing bremsstrahlung. The probability of an isolated electron or hadron leaving a disappearing track is calculated using samples of single electrons or pions passing through the current ATLAS detector layout, and is then scaled to take into account the ratio of material in the current ATLAS inner detector and the upgraded inner tracker. The second background contribution arises from events which contain "fake" tracklets (accidental alignment of hits in the inner detector). These events arise from \(Z\to\nu\nu\) or \(W\to\ell\nu\) (where the lepton is not reconstructed) and are scaled by the expected fake tracklet probability:

\[P_{\mathrm{fake,tight}}^{\mathrm{ITk}}=p_{\mathrm{fake,tight}}^{\mathrm{Run-2}} \times\frac{R_{\mathrm{fake,loose}}^{\mathrm{ITK}}}{R_{\mathrm{fake,loose}}^{ \mathrm{Run-2}}}\times\frac{\epsilon_{z_{0}}^{\mathrm{ITK}}}{\epsilon_{z_{0}}^{ \mathrm{Run-2}}}. \tag{1}\]

In this equation, \(p_{\mathrm{fake,tight}}^{\mathrm{Run-2}}\) is the fake rate of the current Run-2 analysis [44], computed using a \(d_{0}\) sideband for the track reconstruction, \(R_{\mathrm{fake,loose}}^{\mathrm{ITK}}\) is the fake rate in the same \(d_{0}\) sideband for ITk computed with a neutrino particle gun sample, such that all tracks are purely a result of pile-up interactions, \(R_{\mathrm{fake,loose}}^{\mathrm{Run-2}}\) is the fake rate in the \(d_{0}\) sideband for Run 2 computed on data, \(\epsilon_{z_{0}}^{\mathrm{ITK}}\) is the selection efficiency of the tracklet \(z_{0}\) selection in ITk, and \(\epsilon_{z_{0}}^{\mathrm{Run-2}}\) is the selection efficiency of the tracklet \(z_{0}\) selection in Run 2. The ratio of the fake rates in the ITk and Run 2 is found to be \(\approx\)200, as the fake rate depends strongly on pile-up, whilst the ratio of the tracklet selection efficiencies is \(\approx\)0.12, which takes into account the differences in tracklet selection between the search and the Run 2 analysis.

For the dilepton analysis the \(t\bar{t}\) and \(W\)+jets background yields are calculated by fitting the shape of the background \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\) distributions, in order to mitigate statistical fluctuations in the background estimations for these samples. The fit uses an exponential function after all of the SR selections are applied, aside from the \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\) selection. As the final SR fit is performed on the \(m_{\ell\ell}\) variable, the backgrounds are estimated in each \(m_{\ell\ell}\) bin. The predicted values from the fit are found to be consistent with the yields estimated directly from MC, when MC statistics allow for a reasonable comparison to be made. The other SM background processes are estimated directly from MC.

The variables are presented with the full SR selections implemented aside from the selection on the variable shown. Left, \(m_{\ell\ell}\); Right, \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}/H_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{lep}}\). Three signal models with \(m(\chi_{1}^{0})=250\GeV\) and different mass splittings (\(\Delta m(\tilde{\chi}_{2}^{0},\tilde{\chi}_{1}^{0})=4,\,10,\,\mathrm{and}\,50\GeV\)) are overlaid.

## 6 Systematic Uncertainties

Systematic uncertainty projections for both searches have been determined starting from the systematic uncertainties studied in Ref. [17], and evolving them to a level which the ATLAS and CMS collaborations have agreed to consider as a sensible extrapolation to 3 ab\({}^{-1}\) of proton-proton collisions. Hence, the theory modelling uncertainties are expected to halve while the recommendations for detector-level and experimental uncertainties are dependent upon the systematic uncertainty under consideration and are scaled appropriately from the Run 2 analysis [18]. When setting exclusion limits, an additional systematic uncertainty of 15% is applied to the dilepton signal samples, whereas a 20% uncertainty is applied to the disappearing track analysis, to account for the theoretical systematic uncertainty on the models under consideration.

The dominant uncertainties in the disappearing track analysis arise from the modelling of the fake tracklet component, and the total uncertainty on the background yield is extrapolated to be 30%. In the dilepton Run 2 analysis the dominant uncertainties are due to the modelling of the fake and non-prompt lepton backgrounds and the experimental uncertainties related to the jet energy scale and flavour tagging. The total uncertainty for the dilepton search is also extrapolated to be 30%. The experimental uncertainty is assumed to be fully correlated between the background and the signal.

## 7 Results

The HistFitter framework [45], which utilises a profile-likelihood-ratio test statistic [46], is used to compute expected exclusion limits with the CL\({}_{s}\) prescription [47].

Table 3 presents the expected yields in the SR for the disappearing track search for each background source, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 3000 fb\({}^{-1}\). As seen in the table the dominant background source is events with a "fake" tracklet, arising predominantly from \(Z\to\nu\nu\) events with an ISR jet and high \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\), which contain spurious hits that are reconstructed as a tracklet.

Limits at 95% CL on the chargino lifetime are shown in Figure 5 as a function of the \(\tilde{\chi}_{1}^{\pm}\) mass. The simplified models of chargino production considered include chargino pair production and chargino-neutralino production (both \(\tilde{\chi}_{1}^{\pm}\tilde{\chi}_{1}^{0}\) and \(\tilde{\chi}_{1}^{\pm}\tilde{\chi}_{2}^{0}\)). The potential for the full HL-LHC dataset is expected to exclude at the 95% CL chargino lifetimes, assuming a wino-like (higgsino-like) LSP, of between 7 ps (10 ps) and 4 \(\mu\)s (1.5 \(\mu\)s) for light charginos with a mass of 100 GeV. Heavier wino-like (higgsino-like) charginos are expected to be excluded up to m(\(\tilde{\chi}_{1}^{\pm}\)) = 1100 GeV (750 GeV) for lifetimes of 1 ns. The

discovery potential of the analysis would allow for the discovery of wino-like (higgsino-like) charginos of mass 100 GeV with lifetimes between 20 ps and 700 ns (30 ps and 250 ns), or for a lifetime of 1 ns would allow the discovery of wino-like (higgsino-like) charginos of mass up to 800 GeV (600 GeV). Comparing the results to the theoretical prediction from Ref.[30], would allow for the exclusion at 95% CL of the theory with masses up to 850 GeV for the pure wino scenario and 250 GeV for the pure higgsino scenario.

The discovery potential would be up to 450 GeV for the pure wino scenario and 150 GeV for the pure higgsino scenario.

The background yields for the dilepton SRs (split into the respective \(m_{\ell\ell}\) intervals) are presented in Table 4. The main background in each SR is dependent upon the \(m_{\ell\ell}\) interval under consideration, with \(t\bar{t}\) the main background for the lowest \(m_{\ell\ell}\) interval, the intermediate \(m_{\ell\ell}\) selections dominated by \(Z\)+jets events, and the larger \(m_{\ell\ell}\) intervals dominated by diboson production. The \(t\bar{t}\) and diboson yields include the component from misidentified leptons. For the lowest \(m_{\ell\ell}\) bin the component of \(t\bar{t}\) from misidentified leptons is 40%, while it is 15% in the highest \(m_{\ell\ell}\) bin.

Figure 6 shows the 95% CL expected exclusion limits in the m(\(\tilde{\chi}^{0}_{2}\)), \(\Delta m(\tilde{\chi}^{0}_{2},\tilde{\chi}^{0}_{1})\) plane. With 3000 fb\({}^{-1}\), \(\tilde{\chi}^{0}_{2}\) masses up to 350 GeV could be excluded, as well as \(\Delta m(\tilde{\chi}^{0}_{2},\tilde{\chi}^{0}_{1})\) between 2 and 20 GeV for m(\(\tilde{\chi}^{0}_{2}\)) = 150 GeV. In the figure the blue curve presents the 5\(\sigma\) discovery potential of the search. To calculate the discovery potential a single-bin discovery test is performed by integrating over all of the \(m_{\ell\ell}\) bins from 1 to the chosen \(m_{\ell\ell}\) upper limit for a given SR selection (aside from \(3<m_{\ell\ell}<3.2\) GeV).

Figure 7 presents the 95% expected exclusion limits in the \(\tilde{\chi}^{0}_{1},\Delta m(\tilde{\chi}^{\pm}_{1},\tilde{\chi}^{0}_{1})\) mass plane, from both the disappearing track and dilepton searches. The yellow contour shows the expected exclusion limit from the disappearing track search, with the possibility to exclude \(m(\tilde{\chi}^{\pm}_{1})\) up to 600 GeV for \(\Delta m(\tilde{\chi}^{\pm}_{1},\tilde{\chi}^{0}_{1})<0.2\) GeV,

Figure 5: Expected exclusion limits at 95% CL from the disappearing track search using 3000 fb\({}^{-1}\)of 14 TeV proton-proton collision data as a function of the \(\tilde{\chi}^{\pm}_{1}\) mass and lifetime. Simplified models including both \(\tilde{\chi}^{\pm}\tilde{\chi}^{\mp}\) and \(\tilde{\chi}^{\pm}\tilde{\chi}^{0}\) are considered assuming pure-wino scenarios (left) and pure-higgsino scenarios (right). The yellow band shows the 1\(\sigma\) region of the distribution of the expected limits. The median of the expected limits is shown by a dashed line. The red line presents the current limits from the Run 2 analysis and the hashed region is used to show the direction of the exclusion. The expected limits with the upgraded ATLAS detector would extend these limits significantly. In the pure-wino scenario, the chargino lifetime as a function of the chargino mass calculated at the two loop level [48] is shown by the dashed grey line. In the pure-higgsino scenario the mass-lifetime relation is shown by the dashed grey line and is calculated at the one loop level [30]. The relationship between the masses of the chargino and the two lightest neutralinos in this scenario is \(m(\tilde{\chi}^{\pm}_{1})=\frac{1}{2}(m(\tilde{\chi}^{0}_{1})+m(\tilde{\chi}^{0 }_{2}))\).

and could exclude up to \(\Delta m(\tilde{X}_{1}^{\pm},\tilde{X}_{1}^{0})=0.4\) GeV for \(m(\tilde{X}_{1}^{\pm})=100\) GeV. The blue curve presents the expected exclusion limits from the dilepton search, which could exclude up to 350 GeV in \(m(\tilde{X}_{1}^{\pm})\), and for a light chargino mass of 100 GeV would exclude mass differences between 2 and 15 GeV. Improvements that are expected with the upgraded detector, and search technique improvements may further enhance the sensitivity to these models. For example the sensitivity of the disappearing tracks search can be enhanced by the \(\Delta m(\tilde{X}_{1}^{\pm})\) requirement, which is a consequence of the \(\Delta m(\tilde{X}_{1}^{\pm})\) requirement.

by optimising the tracking algorithms used for the upgraded ATLAS detector allowing for an increase in tracklet efficiency, the possibility of shorter tracklets produced requiring 3 or 4 hits, and further suppression of the fake tracklet component. The dilepton search sensitivity would be expected to improve by increasing the reconstruction efficiency for low \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) leptons. The addition of the electron channel would also further enhance the search sensitivity.

## 8 Conclusion

This note presents studies performed to assess the sensitivity to electroweakino production with the HL-LHC and the upgraded ATLAS detector, using \(3000\,\mathrm{fb}^{-1}\) of \(\sqrt{s}=14\,\mathrm{TeV}\) data. Well motivated and natural SUSY scenarios predict a compressed electroweakinos sector. Two signatures with good discovery potential are considered in this prospect note (disappearing track and soft leptons). In a pure-Higgsino scenario, the former can discover up to \(600\,\mathrm{GeV}\) charginos with 1 ns lifetime while the latter could discover the second lightest neutralino with mass up to \(200\,\mathrm{GeV}\). Improvements that could be expected with the upgraded detector will provide additional sensitivity for both of the searches presented.

Figure 7: Expected exclusion at the 95% CL from the disappearing track and dilepton searches in the \(\Delta m(\tilde{\chi}^{\pm}_{1},\tilde{\chi}^{0}_{1})\), \(m(\tilde{\chi}^{\pm}_{1})\) mass plane. The blue curve presents the exclusion limits from the dilepton search. The yellow contour presents the exclusion limit from the disappearing track search. The figure also presents the limits on chargino production from LEP [16]. The relationship between the masses of the chargino and the two lightest neutralinos in this scenario is \(m(\tilde{\chi}^{\pm}_{1})=\frac{1}{2}(m(\tilde{\chi}^{0}_{1})+m(\tilde{\chi}^ {0}_{2}))\). The theory curve is a prediction from a pure higgsino scenario taken from Ref.[30].
