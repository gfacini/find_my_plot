**FORWARD JET TAGGING IN HEAVY HIGGS PRODUCTION AT THE LHC**

V.V. Zmushkn

IHEP, Serpukhov, Russia

The process

\[qq\to qqH\to qqZZ, \tag{1}\]

gives at large \(M_{H}\) and LHC energies approximately the same contribution to the Higgs production as the process

\[gg\to H\to ZZ. \tag{2}\]

Tagging a single forward jet in the process (1) leads to the suppression of the background caused by the QCD nonresonance ZZ-pairs [1]. Once the Higgs will be discovered, the separation of the process (1) allows also to study the VVH coupling and the scattering of the longitudinal vector bosons.

In Ref. [1] a parton level study has been made with the exactly calculated amplitudes for the process\(\_qq\to qqZZ\). The work [1] was done for SSC. A goal of this work is to consider in case LHC a possibility of the jets tagging by a forward calorimeter with rather rough granularity \(\Delta_{\eta}\times\Delta_{\phi}=0.5\times 0.5\), as it was suggested in Ref. [2]. The \(H\to 4l\) (\(l=e,\mu\)) and \(H\to ll\nu\nu\) decay modes are considered only.

For calculations the ISAJET program (version 6.36) is used. The full matrix elements of (1) are not included in the ISAJET program. For Higgs production the \(VV\to H\to VV\) and \(VV\to VV\) amplitudes are taken into account only. The vector bosons are appear from a quark bremsstrahlung in the parton cascade. To order to estimate the efficiency of the jet reconstructing algorithm the results are compared with the parton level calculations.

For the parton level calculations for LHC the ISAJET program is also used. The partons from the parton cascades with \(Q^{2}>0\) and the maximum \(p_{T}\) are chosen for the tagging. Then as for the particle jets from two partons with \(2<|\eta|<5\) we use one that have the maximum energy.

It is supposed that the forward calorimeters will have the coverage \(3<|\eta|<5\). The coverage is enlarged by using the end cup calorimeters with the running parameters. For all calorimeters the granularity is \(\Delta_{\eta}\times\Delta_{\phi}=0.5\times 0.5\) and the energy resolutions are \((\Delta E/E)_{\mu}=20\%/\sqrt{E}\) and \((\Delta E/E)_{\mu}=100\%/\sqrt{E}\). For the forward calorimeter the cell size will be compatible with the hadronic shower size. As it was shown in Ref. [4] the hadronic shower size for the calorimeter granularity \(\Delta>0.2\) has small influence on the reconstruction of the jets in the forward calorimeter. Therefore for calorimeter simulation the shower size is not taken into account.

To search the Higgs boson with high mass the luminosity up to \(2^{+}10^{34}\)\(cm^{-*}s^{-}\) is needed. At this luminosity there are about 20 inelastic pp interactions in each bunch crossing. We mixed the considered event with \(n_{MB}\) MINHIAS-events and \(n_{T}\) TWOJFT events with \(p_{T}^{ret}>3\)\(GeV/c\) in order to simulate the pile-up. The quantities \(n_{MB}\) and \(n_{T}\) were Poisson simulated with the average value of 10. _all events generated from aave subset \(p_{T}\):of-up_.

The typical transverse energy distributions for tagged jets in the calorimeter are shown in Fig. 1. The jets are reconstructed with the help of the cluster algorithm [4]. The cell with maximum \(E_{T}\) was chosen, then the connected set of the cells with \(F_{T}^{\rm tail}>E_{T}^{\rm cut}\) forms the cluster. The value \(E_{T}^{\rm cut}\) is taken from the condition \(F_{T}^{\rm tail}>E_{T}^{\rm cut}>\). For the Higgs and QCD background events with pile-up \(<F_{T}^{\rm cut}>\) is equal about 5 \(GeV/c\) and \(E_{T}^{\rm cut}=10\)\(GeV/c\).

The analysis is carried out for the Higgs\(\;\)mode\(\;M_{\mu}-800\)\(GeV\) and the t quark mass \(m_{t}=140\)\(GeV\). The leptons are assumed to be measured with 100% efficiency. We have put the cuts for the 41 channel on the Z transverse momenta, pseudorapidity and 7Z invariant mass:

\[\eta_{T}^{Z}>\frac{1}{4}\sqrt{M_{Z}^{2}-1M_{Z}^{2}},\quad|\eta_{Z}|<2.5,\quad M _{ZZ}>500\ GeV \tag{3}\]

and for the \(ll\nu\) channel the cuts on the transverse momentum and the pseudorapidity of the reconstructed from \(l^{+}l^{-}\) Z and the missing transverse momentum:

\[p_{T}^{Z-\rm tail}>150\ GeV/c,\quad|\eta^{Z-\rm tail}|<2.5,\quad p_{T}^{ \rm mass}>150\ GeV/c. \tag{4}\]

Since in this case the precision of the \(p_{T}^{miss}\) measurement is not important, \(p_{T}^{miss}=p_{T}^{Z-\rm-\nu r}\) is taken. For the \(\eta\) coverage \(|\eta|<5\) the cut \(p_{T}^{miss}>150\ GeV/c\)is sufficient to suppress the background from the process \(pp\to Z+jets\) [3]. The \(p_{T}\) cuts are chosen relatively small in order to save a shape of the \(p_{T}^{\rm{2}-m}\) and \(M_{T}^{ZZ}\) spectra.

Fig. 2 and 1 show the energy distribution of the tagged jet for 41 and \(\mu\nu\) channels, respectively (the hadron level calculation of the QCD background has been made only for 41 channel). For \(VV\cdots H\) events the curves of the parton and hadron level calculations are coincide for \(E_{j}>1000~{}GeV\). The QCD background events give somewhat greater number of jets because of the fake jets in low \(p_{T}\). The background may be suppressed further, if the cut on \(p_{T}\) of jets is imposed ( Table 1 ). Mass distributions of Z pairs before and after jet tagging for 41 events are shown in Fig. 3. The numbers of signal and background events expected at the LHC with an integrated luminosity of \(10^{5}~{}pb^{-1}\) are presented in Table 1. It can be seen that in this case it is not profitable in terms of statistical significance to use tagging for Higgs search. The decay mode \(H\to ll\nu\nu\) has branching ratio six times larger than the decay to \(t\). In the flavor channel the signal may be searched as a Jacobian peak in the \(p_{T}^{\rm{2}-m}\) distribution or in the transverse mass distribution, \(m_{T}^{ZZ}\)[3]. These distribution are shown in Fig. 5 and 6, respectively. In both cases the signal is clearly visible for the tagged events.

Thus, the forward calorimeter with rough granularity \(\Delta_{\eta}\times\Delta_{\phi}=0.5\times 0.5\) is usefull for the jet tagging. The considered here single jet tagging can be used to enhance the Higgs signal in the \(ll\nu\nu\) channel.
