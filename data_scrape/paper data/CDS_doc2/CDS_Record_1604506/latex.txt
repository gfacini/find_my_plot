Sensitivity of ATLAS at HL-LHC to flavour changing neutral currents in top quark decays \(t\to cH\), with \(H\to\gamma\gamma\)

The ATLAS Collaboration

###### Abstract

The sensitivity of a search for flavour changing neutral currents in top quark decays \(t\to cH\), with \(H\to\gamma\gamma\) at HL-LHC with \(\sqrt{s}=14\TeV\) using the ATLAS detector is estimated. The analysis extrapolates the preliminary result obtained by ATLAS with data at \(\sqrt{s}=7\TeV\) and 8. It is based on \(t\bar{t}\) events in which one top decays to \(cH\), the other decays to \(bW\), and both the hadronic and the leptonic decay modes of the \(W\) are used and combined. An expected upper limit on the branching ratio of about 1.5 \(\cdot 10^{-4}\) at the 95% confidence level is obtained.

Introduction

The observation in 2012 by the ATLAS and the CMS Collaborations of a new boson with a mass around 125 GeV, compatible with the long-sought Higgs boson, opens up the possibility of searching for the decay of a top quark to a Higgs boson plus a light quark of charge 2/3. Such a decay would proceed via a flavour changing neutral current (FCNC), analogous to the so far unobserved \(t\to cZ\) decay. According to the Standard Model (SM), FCNC processes are forbidden at tree level and, with respect to the dominant decay mode (\(t\to bW\)), very much suppressed at higher orders due to the Glashow-Iliopoulos-Maiani (GIM) mechanism [1]. Observation of FCNC decays of the top quark would therefore provide a clear signal of new physics.

In models beyond the SM, the GIM suppression can be relaxed, and loop diagrams mediated by new bosons may contribute, yielding effective couplings orders of magnitude larger than those of the SM. Examples of such extensions are the quark-singlet model (QS) [2, 3, 4], two-Higgs doublet models of type I with explicit flavour conservation (FC-2HDM), or two-Higgs doublet models of type II, like the minimal supersymmetric model (MSSM) [5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11]. In 2HDM without explicit flavour conservation (type III), see Refs. [12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18] and recently Refs. [19, 20], the \(tc(u)H\) couplings are present at tree level. For a general review see Ref. [21]. Table 1 shows typical predicted branching ratios (\(Br\)) for some of these models, in comparison to those predicted by the SM.

The \(t\to c(u)Z\) decay mode has been searched for, without observation, by ATLAS [22], CMS [23], CDF [24] and the LEP experiments [25] (via the crossed-process \(Z\to t\bar{c}(\bar{u})+h.c.\)).

The numbers listed in the table show that, among all the possibilities, the largest branching ratio (\(\sim 1.5\cdot 10^{-3}\)) corresponds to the \(t\to cH\) decay. It appears in 2HDM of type III, in which the FCNC tree level coupling is not forbidden by an additional symmetry. The branching ratio quoted in the table corresponds to a coupling which scales with quark masses as \(g_{uqH}\propto\sqrt{2m_{q}m_{t}}/v\), as advocated in Ref. [12], where \(v/\sqrt{2}\) is the Higgs vacuum expectation value (\(v=246\) GeV). In several other models, the branching ratio of \(t\to cH\) is in the range of a few \(10^{-5}\).

A branching ratio measurement, or limit, \(Br\) for the decay mode \(t\to cH\) can be translated into a value, or limit, for the \(tcH\) coupling \(\lambda_{tcH}\) by :

\[\lambda_{tcH}=1.91\ \sqrt{Br}\]

( see Refs. [21] and [26]) which is directly comparable to the \(t\bar{t}H\) coupling given by \(\lambda_{t}=\sqrt{2}m_{t}/v\).

The \(t\to cH\) decay mode has been searched for by ATLAS [26] in \(t\bar{t}\) production, using 20 fb\({}^{-1}\) of proton-proton collision data at \(\sqrt{s}=8\) TeV and 5 fb\({}^{-1}\) of proton-proton collision data at \(\sqrt{s}=7\) TeV. The diphoton (\(H\to\gamma\gamma\)) final state was used. Despite the small branching ratio (\(\sim 0.23\%\) for a Higgs boson mass of 125 GeV), this mode has proven to have a high significance for an inclusive search,

with a rather large number of events and a clean signature [27, 28]. Two final states were searched for: the hadronic and leptonic channels, dedicated to events where the second top of the pair decays into a hadronically and a leptonically decaying \(W\) and a \(b\)-quark. No significant signal was observed and an upper limit on the branching ratio of 0.83% (0.53% expected) at the 95% confidence level was set. The corresponding limit on the \(tcH\) coupling is 0.17 (0.14 expected).

While both in Ref. [26] and in this document we refer to the \(t\to cH\) decay, it is to be noted that the event selection used is almost as efficient for \(t\to uH\) final states as it is for \(t\to cH\), the main difference being that the presence of a charm quark in the final state increase by \(\simeq\)20% the probability that one of the jets in the final state is \(b\)-tagged. Thus strictly speaking what is being measured is the sum of the branching ratios to \(cH\) and \(uH\), the second one being slightly underweighted in the sum. Based on the theory prejudice that the branching ratio to \(cH\) is in general much larger than to \(uH\), the present note sticks to the \(tcH\) notation. In any case this makes the limits quoted for \(tcH\) only more conservative.

**Methodology for estimating the sensitivity at HL-LHC**

The analysis reported in [26] was conducted in three steps. In a first step diphoton candidates are selected, on the basis of photon information only. In a second step, additional cuts are applied, in order to select only those events which are compatible with a production through a \(t\bar{t}\) intermediate state, followed by the decay of one of the top quarks (called _Top1_ in the following) to the diphoton final state, via the Higgs boson decay, and a charm or light quark, while the other one (_Top2_) decays either hadronically (fully hadronic selection) or semi-leptonically. In a last step, the diphoton mass distribution of the selected events is analysed, using a sideband technique, in order to estimate the number of signal events.

The sensitivity of a similar analysis at HL-LHC is estimated by scaling the numbers observed in Ref. [26], both for simulated Monte-Carlo (MC) samples and for data. In particular:

* the cross-sections for \(t\bar{t}\) production and for Higgs boson production by SM processes are taken at \(\sqrt{s}=14\) TeV;
* the integrated luminosity is taken as 3000 fb\({}^{-1}\);
* the acceptance of signal events, which was obtained from a full simulation of events generated by Protos 2.2 [29], is scaled between 8 and 14 TeV using simulations (with Protos) at "truth level";
* the effect of increased pile-up on photons is taken into account by using parametrized (as a function of the photon \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\)) identification efficiencies;
* the effect of pile-up on jets is mitigated by using harder \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) cuts than at 8 TeV;
* the background in the sidebands is calculated from what was observed in data at 8 TeV, scaled assuming it is dominated by non-resonant production of the two-photon + jets final state. The MC used for the extrapolation is a sample of non-resonant di-photon events generated using Sherpa [30] with between one and three additional partons in the matrix element. It is referred to as \(\gamma\gamma j\) in the following.

In some cases, the truth level simulations have been made at 13 TeV instead of 14 TeV. A linear extrapolation from the 8 to 13 variation, to the desired 8 to 14 was then used.

**Cross-sections**

The cross-sections of the relevant processes, at \(\sqrt{s}=8\) TeV and at \(\sqrt{s}=14\) TeV, are listed in Table 2. The inclusive \(\gamma\gamma j\) cross-section corresponds to the phase space selected by a cut on the photon \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) at 14GeV, and on the diphoton invariant mass at 80 GeV. Both for \(t\overline{t}\) and \(t\overline{t}H\) there is a strong correlation in the QCD scales, PDF, and \(\alpha_{S}\) variations between the two energies, and therefore the uncertainty on the cross-section ratios will be neglected in the following.

## 2 Signal and background for the hadronic analysis

### Scaling of signal acceptance

As written in the introduction, the acceptance at 14 TeV is estimated starting from the acceptance determined at 8 TeV using a sample of signal events produced by Protos, and processed through a full simulation of the ATLAS detector using GEANT.

Since full simulations at 14 TeV are not available for most of the relevant samples, a "scale factor" to be applied to the 8 TeV acceptance is obtained by taking the ratio of acceptances at 14 TeV and at 8 TeV determined using simulations at "truth level". In these simulations the four momenta of stable particles (electrons, muons, photons) are taken unmodified from the "particle level" generator. Jets are produced from all stable (\(c\tau>10\)\(\mu\)m) interacting particles produced by the MC generators (except muons) with the anti-k\({}_{\rm T}\) algorithm with a radius parameter of 0.4.

Fig. 1 shows the distribution of invariant masses, \(M_{1}\), for events passing a selection similar to the one used in Ref. [26], namely:

* 2 photons within detector acceptance (\(|\eta|<1.37\) or \(1.55<|\eta|<2.37\)), and with \(p_{\rm T}>40\) (30) GeV for the leading (subleading) one;
* no identified lepton;
* at least 4 jets with \(p_{\rm T}>25\) (30) GeV if \(|\eta|<2.5\) (\(2.5<|\eta|<4.5\)).

Only the four jets with the highest \(p_{\rm T}\) are used. A requirement of at least one \(b\)-tagged jet among the four is also made in Ref. [26] and is included in this HL-LHC analysis.

The mass \(M_{1}\) is the invariant mass of _Top1_ built out of the two photons and one of the 4 jets (thus there are 4 entries per event in Fig. 1). In a similar way, Fig. 2 shows the distribution of invariant masses \(M_{2}\) of _Top2_ built out of the 3 remaining jets, provided the associated \(M_{1}\) mass falls into the selection window, chosen in Ref. [26] to be [156, 191] GeV. The selection window for \(M_{2}\) is [130, 210] GeV. The two figures show that full and "truth level" simulations at 8 and 14 TeV are close enough to allow using the number of events passing the selection cuts to extrapolate acceptances between 8 and 14 TeV.

The acceptances in the cases considered above are shown in Table 3. Also shown are the acceptances for harder cuts on the \(p_{\rm T}\) of jets, namely 35 (50) GeV for \(|\eta|<2.5\) (\(2.5<|\eta|<4.5\)). This second set of cuts is intended to reduce the number of additional jets due to pile-up. References [31, 32] report that, for an average number of pileup collisions \(\mu\)=140 there are in average \(\simeq 15\) additional jets for \(p_{\rm T}>20\) GeV, and only \(\simeq 0.4\) when \(p_{\rm T}>40\) GeV is required ( for \(|\eta|<4.5\)).

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|l|c c|} \hline Centre of mass energy & \(8\) TeV & 14 TeV \\ \hline \(t\overline{t}\) (pb) & 246 (+9,-11) & 954 (+27,-38) \\ \(t\overline{t}H\) (fb) & 130 (+16,-22) & 610 (+15,-18) \\ Sherpa \(\gamma\gamma j\) (pb) & 61.6 & 135 \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 2: Cross-sections for the most important processes considered in this note.

In the bottom part of the table, account is taken of the fact that the W of the second top decays in 67.6% of the cases hadronically, and in 32.4% of the cases leptonically. The acceptance of the cuts described above is small for the leptonic decay mode, but non-zero, and therefore some of these events are present in the final selection.

### Scaling of background acceptance

The same selection as described above is applied to \(\gamma\gamma j\) samples simulated with Sherpa. It was shown in Ref. [26] that this source dominates the data sample of events passing the cuts listed above. The

acceptances equivalent to Table 3 for the simulated signal are listed in Table 4 for the background. As the acceptances are very small, large samples were used (up to 10 million events for the full simulation, and a minimum of 0.4 millions for the "truth level" at 8 and at 13 TeV. A pre-filtering was applied with an efficiency slightly larger at 8 TeV (by 9.8%) which is taken into account in the efficiencies listed.

### Expected number of signal and background events at HL-LHC

* The expected number of signal events at HL-LHC is obtained from the number expected in the 8 TeV data sample [26] which was 9.3\(\pm\)0.7 for \(Br\)=1%, using the ratios of cross-sections between 8 and 14 TeV (see Table 2), the ratio of integrated luminosities, taken as 150, and the ratio of acceptances at truth level, taken from Table 3. Both the standard set of cuts on jets (25 and 30 GeV) and the tight set of cuts (35 and 50 GeV) are considered. At 8 TeV the requirement on photon isolation was accounted for using the full simulation to calculate the expected number of events. The simple scaling as described above implicitly assumes that the effect of isolation would be identical at HL-LHC. Dedicated studies [33] indicate that the isolation requirement has a lower efficiency. A parametrized (as a function of \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\)) value of this efficiency was used to estimate the ratio of isolation efficiencies, at the level of selected events, for both photons together, between 8 TeVand 14 TeV. Comparing to the full simulation at 8 TeV, the result is a loss of efficiency of 14% in the HL-LHC conditions. This factor is taken into account in the scaling of acceptances, reducing by the same amount the acceptances as they appear in Table 3. In the analysis reported in Ref. [26], a requirement of at least one \(b\)-tagged jet among the 4 selected was applied. It is assumed that the same requirement would be applied at HL-LHC. The performance study reported in [33] shows that, due to tracking detector improvements, the light jet rejection is about 100 (in average) for a \(b\)-tagging efficiency of 70% on jets carrying a beauty hadron. Since this is practically identical to the performance at 8 TeV, no scaling factor is applied to \(b\)-tagging efficiency. The resulting sensitivity (expected number of events) is given in Table 5.

analysis cuts, for which the diphoton invariant mass is in the interval [100,160] GeV is obtained from the **observed** number of events in this range in the 8 TeV data sample (see Ref. [26]), and attributed to background, which was 39, and scaled in a similar way as was done above for the signal. The ratio of the Sherpa cross-sections between 8 and 14 TeV (see Table 2) is used, together with the ratio of acceptances at truth level, taken from Table 4. Both the standard and tight sets of cuts on jets are considered. The factor accounting for photon isolation is taken identical as for the signal. The result is shown in Table 5.
* The expected number of events from SM sources is calculated in the same way as for the signal. Only the \(t\bar{t}H\) source is considered, the other ones (\(WH\), \(ZH\), VBF, ggF) which were already smaller altogether at 8 TeV than \(t\bar{t}H\) having cross-sections which rise more slowly than the former one. Furthermore, at 14 TeV, the selection cuts are expected to have a comparatively smaller acceptance for these modes. The results are given in Table 5.

## 3 Leptonic final state

The aim of the leptonic analysis is to identify candidate events in which the \(W\) from the second top decays leptonically. Only electrons and muons are considered as _identified_ leptons.

The selection criteria are the same as in Ref. [26]. They are applied to simulations at "truth level" and compared to "full simulations" available at 8 TeV only. In order to avoid selecting events containing a \(Z\) decaying into a lepton pair, only events with exactly one lepton are considered. The \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) requirement applied at "truth level" is 20 GeV, while for full simulation (and data) at 8 TeV, the cut was at 10 (15) GeV for muons (electrons). Furthermore, events are required to have:

* 2 photons within detector acceptance (\(|\eta|<1.37\) or \(1.55<|\eta|<2.37\)), and with \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>40\) (30) GeV for the leading (subleading) one;
* at least 2 jets with \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>25\) (30) GeV if \(|\eta|<2.5\) (\(2.5<|\eta|<4.5\)).

The two jets with highest \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) are used for subsequent steps. A requirement of at least one \(b\)-tagged jet among the two is also made in [26] and is included in this HL-LHC analysis.

In order to efficiently select events in which the \(W\) of the second top decays leptonically, \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\) is used to calculate, with the lepton \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\), the transverse mass \(m_{\mathrm{T}}\) of the \(W\) candidate. A cut requiring \(m_{\mathrm{T}}\) larger than 30 GeV is applied.

With the above selection, two invariant mass pairs are formed, \(M_{1}\) being the mass of one jet and the two photons (_Top1_ combination), while \(M_{2}\) is the mass of _Top2_ built out of the remaining jet, the lepton and the neutrino. The longitudinal momentum of the neutrino is calculated using the \(W\) mass constraint.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|c|} \hline  & Expected FCNC signal & SM sources & Background in [100,160] GeV \\ \hline Events at 8 TeV & 9.3\(\pm\)0.7 (\(B\)\(r\)=1\%) & 0.14\(\pm\)0.02 & 39 \\ Cross-section ratio & 3.88 & 4.69 & 2.19 \\ \hline Acceptance ratio (std. cuts) & 0.72\(\pm\)0.03 & 0.72\(\pm\)0.03 & 0.91\(\pm\)0.07 \\ Events at 14 TeV (std. cuts) & 39 (\(B\)\(r\)=0.01\%) & 71 & 11700 \\ \hline Acceptance ratio (tight cuts) & 0.29\(\pm\)0.04 & 0.29\(\pm\)0.04 & 0.18\(\pm\)0.03 \\ Events at 14 TeV (tight cuts) & 16 (\(B\)\(r\)=0.01\%) & 28 & 2320 \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 5: For the hadronic selection, statistics at 8 TeV and expectations at HL-LHC. In the first line (8 TeV), the number for the background is the number of observed events, attributed to background, in data.

As the estimation of \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\) is going to be difficult at HL-LHC, a less accurate, but more robust to pile-up estimate is used for the 14 TeV simulation at truth level. It is obtained by calculating \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\) only from the lepton, the two photons and the jets which pass the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) cut. The performance at 14 TeV is illustrated by Fig 3. The associated reduced efficiency with respect to the selection window applied to the _Top2_ mass ([145,205] GeV), is included in Table 6.

### Scaling of signal acceptance

The acceptances in the cases considered above are shown in Table 6. Also shown are the acceptances for harder cuts on the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) of jets, namely 35 (50) GeV for \(|\eta|<2.5\) (\(2.5<|\eta|<4.5\)). The transverse mass cut at 30 GeV is unchanged.

The absolute acceptance of the "truth level" studies is not relevant; only the ratio between 8 and 14 TeV is used.

### Scaling of background acceptance

The \(\gamma\gamma jj\) process simulated with Sherpa has a negligibly small acceptance for the leptonic selection, given the high fake rejection power of the ATLAS lepton identification. It was shown in Ref. [26] that

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|l|c c c|} \hline Signal simulation, Leptonic mode & 8 TeV-Full & 8 TeV-Truth & 14TeV-Truth \\ \hline Acceptance(\(\pm\) stat) in \% at the diphoton level & 34.9\(\pm\)0.3 & 59.4\(\pm\)0.5 & 56.0\(\pm\)0.5 \\ Jet threshold (GeV) & (25,30) & (25,30) & (35,50) & (25,30) & (35,50) \\ Acceptance(\(\pm\) stat) in \% & 5.6\(\pm\)0.1 & 8.5\(\pm\)0.2 & 5.7\(\pm\)0.1 & 7.5\(\pm\)0.1 & 4.9\(\pm\)0.1 \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 6: For the leptonic selection, acceptance for the simulated signal defined as the ratio of number of events passing analysis cuts, to the number of generated events. At the diphoton level, only the cuts on photons (geometrical acceptance, \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\)) are applied. The leptonic branching ratio of the W is not included in these acceptances.

Figure 3: For the leptonic selection, distribution of the invariant masses of the _Top2_ combinations, for all events where the corresponding _Top1_ combination falls into the selection window.

a suitable approach to describe the diphoton spectrum after selection cuts consists in replacing, in the Sherpa sample, the lowest \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) jet by a lepton of identical kinematical parameters. The same approach is used here to scale the background from data at 8 TeV to the HL-LHC conditions, using simulations at "truth level". The acceptances equivalent to Table 6 for the simulated signal are listed in Table 7 for the background.

Only the ratio of acceptances at "truth level" between 8 and 14 TeV matters.

### Expected number of signal and background events at HL-LHC

* The expected number of signal events at HL-LHC is obtained starting from the number expected in the 8 TeV data sample [26] which was 2.9\(\pm\)0.3 for a _tcH Br_=1%, and using the ratios of cross-sections between 8 and 14 TeV (see Table 2), the ratio of integrated luminosities, taken as 150, and the ratio of acceptances at truth level, taken from Table 3. Both the standard and tight sets of cuts on jets are considered. The same loss of efficiency of 14% associated to photon isolation in the HL-LHC conditions, with respect to the full simulation conditions at 8 TeV is taken into account in the scaling, reducing by the same amount the acceptances at 14 TeV as they appear in Table 6. In the analysis reported in [26], a requirement of at least one \(b\)-tagged jet among the 2 selected was applied. It is assumed that the same requirement would be applied at HL-LHC. Since the \(b\)-tagging performance at HL-LHC is estimated to be practically identical to that at 8 TeV, no scaling factor is applied on \(b\)-tagging efficiency. The resulting sensitivity (expected number of events) is given in Table 8.

* The expected number of background events at HL-LHC, defined as the number of events after analysis cuts, for which the diphoton invariant mass is in the interval [100,160] GeV is obtained from the **observed** number of events in this range in the 8 TeV data sample [26], and attributed to background, and scaled in a similar way as was done above for the signal.

\end{table}
Table 8: For the leptonic analysis, statistics at 8 TeV and expectations at HL-LHC. In the first line (8 TeV), the number for the background is the number estimated from the data, as discussed in the text.

In the 8 TeV data, the number of background events was very small, namely 4 events before the \(b\)-tagging condition, and 1 after. In order to limit the associated uncertainty in the extrapolation, we used the number before the \(b\)-tagging condition, multiplied by a \(b\)-tagging efficiency per 2-jet event, determined from simulation, and from the 4 jets data sample, to be 14.5%. This would give 0.58\(\pm\)0.29 as best estimate of the background in the leptonic analysis, for data. In order to be conservative at this stage, we add one standard deviation to this value, and therefore use for the "nominal" background estimate 0.87\(\pm\)0.29, as reported in table 8. The ratio of the Sherpa cross-sections between 8 and 14 TeV (see Table 2), is used, together with the ratio of acceptances at truth level, taken from Table 4. Both the standard and tight sets of cuts on jets are considered. The factor accounting for photon isolation is taken identical as for the signal. The result is shown in Table 8.
* The expected number of events from SM sources is calculated in the same way as for the signal. Only the \(t\bar{t}H\) source is considered, the other ones (\(WH\), \(ZH\), VBF, ggF) which were already much smaller altogether at 8 TeV than \(t\bar{t}H\) having cross-sections which rise slower than the former one. Furthermore, at 14 TeV, the selection cuts are expected to have a comparatively smaller acceptance for these modes. The results are given in Table 8.

## 4 Expected limit

Table 9 shows the number of signal and background events in the signal region (SR), taken as [123, 129] GeV like in [26]. The numbers directly derive from Tables 5 and 8, taking into account that 86% of signal events (assuming the same resolution as in 8 TeV data) fall in the SR and approximately 15% of background events fall in this same region.

The exact same procedure described in Ref [26] to set a limit on \(Br\) has been applied. The dominant error on the level of background in the diphoton mass distribution is the statistical error on the number of events at 8 TeV, which is considered here as a systematic uncertainty. Two limits are therefore estimated, one which corresponds to the values as they appear in Tables 5 and 8, and one which corresponds to the same numbers increased by their statistical uncertainty (_i.e._ 45.2 for the hadronic selection and 1.16 for the leptonic one). In a conservative way, the cuts on jet \(p_{\rm T}\) chosen for the final results are the tight ones. Given that the largest systematic uncertainty is taken into account by calculating two limits (see above), no other systematic effect is introduced in the likelihood.

**Limits calculated with tight cuts :**

* Limit calculated with the nominal background : The evolution of the signal confidence level \(CL_{s}\) as a function of the hypothesized \(t\to cH\) branching ratio is shown in Fig. 4. In the case of the tight cuts, the limit obtained is \(Br<1.5\cdot 10^{-4}\) at the 95% confidence level, corresponding to a limit on the \(tcH\) coupling of \(\lambda_{tcH}<0.024\).

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|c|c|c|} \hline  & & Expected FCNC signal & SM sources & Background \\ \hline \multirow{2}{*}{std cuts} & Hadronic events & 34 & 61 & 1750 \\  & Leptonic events & 11 & 21 & 37 \\ \hline \multirow{2}{*}{tight cuts} & Hadronic events & 13 & 24 & 350 \\  & Leptonic events & 7 & 14 & 25 \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 9: Expected number of events falling in the SR [123, 129] GeV at HL-LHC, for the hadronic and the leptonic analysis. The expected signal corresponds to \(Br\)=0.01%.

* Limit calculated with the conservative background : The signal confidence level as a function of \(Br\) is shown in Fig. 4 as a dashed line. The limit is only slightly degraded : \(Br<1.7\cdot 10^{-4}\) at 95% CL. The corresponding limit on the \(tcH\) coupling is \(\lambda_{tcH}<0.025\).

**Limits calculated with standard cuts :**

The exact same procedure is used, giving the two curves labelled "loose jet \(p_{\rm T}\) cuts" in Fig. 4. With the nominal (conservative) background the limit on \(Br\) is 1.2 \(\cdot 10^{-4}\) (1.4 \(\cdot 10^{-4}\)).

## 5 Conclusions

Based on the data collected at 8 TeV, an estimate is presented of the sensitivity of ATLAS at HL-LHC to the FCNC \(t\to cH\) decay, followed by \(H\rightarrow\gamma\gamma\). The extrapolation is based on ratios of acceptances calculated at "truth level" at 8 and at 14 TeV. Specific efficiency losses at HL-LHC due to photon isolation with respect to full simulation at 8 TeV are taken into account.

Two different sets of analysis cuts on jets are introduced: standard cuts, identical to those used at 8 TeV, and tight cuts aimed at being more robust against pile-up. The tight cuts have a sensitivity only 20% below the standard ones (for the branching ratio), which indicates that there will be some margin for tuning the cuts when data at HL-LHC become available.

The expected upper limit at the 95% confidence level on the branching ratio, assuming a luminosity of 3 ab\({}^{-1}\) at 14 TeV is 1.5 \(\cdot 10^{-4}\). The derived limit on the \(tcH\) coupling is 2.4%. This sensitivity should be strong enough to rule out some of the models, or demonstrate their relevance in case a significant signal is observed. Several models predict branching ratios of a few \(10^{-5}\), somewhat below the presently estimated limit. The contribution of decay modes in addition to \(H\rightarrow\gamma\gamma\) will enhance the sensitivity to FCNC Higgs couplings beyond what is reported here.
