## 1 Introduction

In the previous publications we were primary considering the local magnetic field in the scintillators and at PMTs positions [1]+ [2]. The results were as following: field in the tiles \(\leq\) 6 mT, PMT location field \(\leq\) 1 mT. These results were confirmed in the recent publications [3]+ [4].

In this Note we undertake an estimation of ponderomotive force distribution, acting on individual units of the system. General formulation of the problem ( the standard configuration and effect of the asymmetries) is given in [1]. Selected problem to be solved here: "an estimation of the force between Extended Barrel and the toroid end cap" [5].

Ponderomotive force is a global quantity of the solution and not a local one as it is with the field estimation at the PMT and tile location. So we need the overall correct TileCal field map all the field sources included. This implies 3D approach and 2D one could give maybe some estimations only. Everybody agreed that the straightforward simulation of the TileCal field is not possible at the moment. Par example one can read in [4]: "There was not enough computing power available to include the complete tile calorimeter in a model to determine the magnetic field of the Atlas detector". That means one needs some simplification or computer models.

## 2 Computer Model

The configuration of the system under consideration with the current parameters [6] is shown in Fig 2.1.

The configuration have some modifications in parameters as compared with the one from Ref. [1]. Presently the solenoid became shorter, Barrel, Extended Barrel and crack region have been modified in their dimensions also. A plug with calorimetry has been inserted into the crack region. An approval of the Integrated Forward Calorimeter implied an insertion of the thick ( 10 cm) iron radiation shielding between the endcap toroid and TileCal. With this iron screen the endcap toroid stray field would be completely magnetically isolated from the TileCal iron and vice versa. The problem is now separated into the two independent ones:

- Endcap toroid force calculation.

- Extended Barrel force calculation.

As far as the first problem concerned it's just the field simulation for the separated from the TileCal muon system unit. So we mainly consider here the second problem.

POISCR 2D code was used to get the field map and to calculate forces acting on the selected volume. Direct Maxwell's stresses method was also applied to check the force calculations with the help of POISCR code.

Calculation were performed for the field map of solenoid only. We assume that the barrel toroid field has minor effect on the field integral along the contour around the Extended Barrel due to screening this unit from the barrel toroid field by the girder.

We have a continuous anisotropic iron with the suitable stack factor inside an active zone of the TileCal with the "easy axis" directed along the R-coordinate. The anisotropy property of the model is connected with the lamination direction of the tile structure which has normal direction to the beam axis. Of cause we have not a pure classical lamination with the set of parallel thin iron plates and small air gaps in between but the staggered tile structure. Nevertheless throughout the active zone of the TileCal we have got some approximation of the real tile structure introducing this anisotropy property into the computer model.

We were able to change the degree of the anisotropy with the help of the linear permeability value \(\mu_{z}\) along Z (beam) axis. The range of this \(\mu_{z}\) variation was from \(\mu_{z}\)=1 (pure air along Z-axis, fully anisotropic material) up to total isotropic nonlinear material (another limiting case).

## 3 Extended Barrel Forces

### Current Configuration

Field maps for various \(\mu_{z}\) values are shown in Figs 3.1+ 3.3. All the necessary definitions for these Figs (axes, regions etc) are given in Fig 2.1.

One can see in Figs 3.1+ 3.3 that the field map inside the Barrel and Extended Barrel resembles the flux lines distribution of other known maps [3] where the real tile structure was used in the computer model. So the true field map belongs to the set of configurations used for the calculations. This means we need not to perform calculation of the true global field map to get the force estimation within the uncertainty range shown in Figs 3.1+ 3.3.

### Configuration Variations

To get an impression of the effect of the plug in the crack region shown in the Fig. 2.1 we calculated the forces without this plug.

### Analysis of Results

### Analysis of Results

There is a good agreement between the force calculation with the help POISCR and using the direct Maxwell's stresses method ( Table I ).

Our results for the configuration from Ref. [1] are more or less consistent with the obtained one in [7]. But the results for the configuration in Fig. 2.1 very much differ from the calculations described in [3] (Table II). The maximum deviation is in the radial force estimation there. The possible reason for this big difference between two calculations could be some difference in the geometry of the configurations considered.

The axial (Z) force tends to move the Extended Barrel to the normal to the beam axis central plane of the detector for all cases.

The radial force tends to squeeze the Extended Barrel toward the beam axis in the case of the current configuration shown in Fig. 2.1 except of the case without the plug in the crack region with the opposite direction of radial force.

The situation is just opposite for the previous configuration from Ref. [1]. The radial force tends to stretch the Extended Barrel outward from the beam axis to the girder.

Variation of the different estimations of the same quantity is still rather large (on average \(\pm\) 2 t/rad). Maximum uncertainty observed for the \(F_{r}\)-value. But this force estimation uncertainty should be compared with the weight of one Extended Barrel sector module which is about 10 tonnes. To compare this number with the given in the Table II we should calculate the weight of the sector of one radian azimuthal width: 10 t\(\times\) 64 sectors / (2\(\pi\)) \(\approx\) 100 tonnes/radian. So we see that even radial magnetic force is only \(\approx\) 3 % of the

corresponding weight of the Extended Barrel part and the force estimation error obtained is quite pertinent for our purpose.

## 4 Barrel Forces

The net force acting on the Barrel in axial direction is zero due to the symmetry of the configuration. Nevertheless we can estimate the forces acting on the half part of the Barrel. Calculated values for this case are given in Table III.

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|} \hline Table III & \(F_{r}\)(tonnes/rad) & \(F_{z}\)(tonnes/rad) \\ \(\mu_{z}\)=500 case & & \\ \hline Fig. 2.1 & - 5.9 & - 4.9 \\ \hline Ref. [3] & - 7.4 & - 52.3 \\ \hline Fig. 2.1 & - 5.9 & - 4.9 \\ without plug & & \\ \hline Ref. [7] & - 2.0 & - \\ \hline \end{tabular}

Again the maximum deviation from the calculations described in [3] is in the radial force. Axial force values are more or less consistent with the obtained one in [3].

## 5 Conclusion

Future investigations should be devoted to the more reliable error estimation of the force calculations by changing conditions of the calculations and using independent force estimations with the help of other than POISCR computer codes (say, OPERA-2D or PE2D and TOSCA-3D).

More detailed force distribution throughout the TileCal is also waiting to be done.
