**Abstract**

Performance of the TileCal High Voltage distributor system for the 2001 beam period are presented.

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:2]

Introduction

The High Voltage (HV) distributor of the TileCal [1] aims at providing some 10000 PMTs of the ATLAS hadronic calorimeter with precise and stable high voltage. Each element of the system (namely HVbus, HVmicro and HVpoto cards) are carefully tested and calibrated (for the HVmicro and HVpoto) at Clermont-Ferrand (where the system was developped) on dedicated test benches before being inserted in super-drawers(SD) where further tests are performed. After certification the super-drawers are sent to CERN and inserted inside TileCal modules.

The TileCal community decided to calibrate 12% of the calorimeter modules [2] and six of them were exposed to the beam in august and september 2001 for that purpose. The HV distributor system was at that time supposed to be the final one (ie the one used in ATLAS) but recent radiation tests required (minor) hardware modifications [3] that should not trigger major changes in the behaviour seen up to now on test benches and at CERN.

The goal of this note is to expose the performance of the HV distributor system at three levels (HV test bench, SD test bench and beam conditions). A comparison of the results obtained is done and a conclusion reached.

## 2 General features

In a super-drawer, the HV distributor system is made of one HVmicro and two HVpoto cards, the whole laying on two HVbus boards. The HVmicro communicates with the outside part of the drawer through CANbus. It sends orders to and read values from HVpoto boards (HV to be applied on the PMTs for the DACs, HV read for the ADCs). HVpoto cards set HVs on the PMTs through the means of regulation loops (24 in total made of an OAP, an optocoupler, two transistors and two zener diodes) with an ouput range of HV\({}_{in}\)-360 V \(\leq\) HV\({}_{out}\)\(\leq\) HV\({}_{in}\) where HV\({}_{in}\) is a common voltage feeding drawers of a given type (HV\({}_{in}\)=-950 V for barrel modules and HV\({}_{in}\)=-830 V for extended barrel modules) provided by Prague power supply. This common HV is splitted in two parts on the board allowing to switch on one half (ie 12 channels) of a given HVpoto card.

6 HVmicro boards and 12 HVpoto were mounted in super-drawers for august and september beam runs. Each card is identified with a serial number and detailed are given in table 1.

## 3 At Clermont-Ferrand

### HV Test benches

HV test benches (figure 1) are used at Clermont to test and to calibrate HVmicro and HVpoto cards (continuity checks are made on HVbus). The main test points for HVmicro are:

* communication with the outside (through CANbus) and with HVpoto boards.
* good transmission of orders (HV, tolerances) to HVpoto boards.

* writing and reading in the EEPROM of CANbus informations (serial number,..).
* check ADC through low voltages digitisation.

As far as HVopto boards are concerned, the main checks are:

* low voltage currents.
* on/off functionnality (ie ability to switch off half of a card)
* ADC and DAC responses: HV orders are sent (and checked by a multimeter-precision: 0.1V) and resulting ADC and DAC counts are required to be within given ranges.

For both type of cards an intercalibration of the temperature probes is performed.

After a first test, each card is burned-in (one week at \(65^{0}\)C) and tested again. HVopto cards are furthermore calibrated (second order fits to get 3 calibration parameters per channel for DACs and for ADCs) and parameters are set in the EEPROM of the board so as to be used in ATLAS by the HVmicro card to send orders or to convert ADC read values.

The precision of the system is directly given by the residuals (DAC and ADC) of the second order fits. Typical results are given on figure 2. The mean values are of \(10^{-6}\) to \(10^{-7}\) and the rmses of 0.07 V for ADCs and 0.1 V for DACs.

Measurements are then performed to probe the quality of the calibration: orders (through the DACs) are sent and ouputs (with a multimeter and ADCs) are checked. Results are given on figure 3 (for the same cards as previously). One observes that ADC residuals did not really change (about 0.07 V) and ADC ones are sensibly equal to them (the discrete distribution for DACs is intrinsic to it: one count is worth as 0.1 V; on the other hand each ADC conversion comes from the average of ten measurement, explaining the continuous distribution).

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|c|c|} \hline Module & HVmicro no & HVopto no & HVbus no & Period \\ \hline LB18\_1 & 151-023 & 150-016 & 142 I & August 01 \\  & & 150-010 & 142 E & \\ \hline LB18\_2 & 151-013 & 150-009 & 144 I & August 01 \\  & & 150-019 & 144 E & \\ \hline EBC38 & 151-016 & 150-007 & 143 I & August 01 \\  & & 150-005 & 143 E & \\ \hline EBA15 & 151-003 & 150-012 & 145 I & August 01 \\  & & 150-014 & 145 E & \\ \hline EBC15 & 151-010 & 150-013 & 146 I & September 01 \\  & & 150-008 & 146 E & \\ \hline EBC24 & 151-018 & 150-017 & 141 I & September 01 \\  & & 150-002 & 141 E & \\ \hline \end{tabular}

### Super-Drawer Test benches

HVmicro and HVopto cards are further tested when integrated on superdrawers (figure 4). The main checkpoints concern:

* Low Voltage currents consumption.
* CANbus communication (writing of a soft adress).
* Availability of switching on/off a quarter of SuperDrawer.
* Systematic HV measurements (600V and nominal voltages).
* Nominal HV and temperature orders written in the EEPROM.
* Temperature probes calibration (absolute calibration thanks to the cooling system).

The last point allows us to compare the results obtained with the ones studied previously. Differences between orders (ie desired HV values) and read HV values are given on figure 5. One observes slightly different results than the ones seen on HV dedicated benches. This is essentially due to the setup used: noise and grounding conditions are not the same for instance. One sees nonetheless that out of 170 channels, only two show (namely channels 2 and 9 of EBC24) differences between order and applied values bigger than 0.5%: 99% of the channels give a precision better than 0.5%. One must stress that in theory the actual voltage applied on the PMTs is unknown. In fact the proper behaviour of the ADC is checked thanks to an external fixed voltage (1.23V) but the path of this fixed voltage to the ADC is not the same as the one of PMT HV to ADC (the dynamic range of the ADC - 0 to 5V - requires a voltage divider and an OAP). Nonetheless the results seen on the HV test bench provide some confidence that the accuracy seen on figure 5 is close to the actual one.

## 4 At CERN

A schematic of the HV system at CERN is given on figure 6. The HVmicro card dialogs with a VME (vmeatl05) through the CANBUS. Two programs of interest are running in the VME:

Figure 4: HV configuration for the Super-Drawer Test Bench.

* hv_act2000 (author: R.Chadelas): collects the outputs of the HVmicro cards and sends orders to it. Results are stored in a share memory.
* serv_hv_2000 (author: M.Vassent): acts as a server. It looks at the informations in the share memory and transmits them to the Labview-based program (TCP/IP) which displays them. A DLL with various informations (high voltages, drawer number,...) is also sent to a share memory related to the PVSSII system. The informations are then stored on a database every other minutes.

After light leakage searches (low voltages), nominal HV values are set on PMTs. Cesium runs are then performed to equalize cell-to-cell responses and HV adjusted accordingly. HV are then not modified during beam exposure.

### HV results

HV distributor performance can be evaluated through precision and stability results.

#### 4.1.1 Precision

The precision of the system is given by the difference between the PMT HV one wants to apply and the HV that is read. Mean values and RMSes are given in table 2.

The differences between august and september HV results was found to be due to low voltages setup: in august, +5V and +15V had the same source for the HV side and the readout side of the superdrawers. This had two major drawbacks: it created grounding problems (explaining the shifts seen in table 2) and to each intervention on the low voltages to cure readout problems (and God knows how often it happened!) was corresponding an interruption of the HV distributor system. Fortunately low voltages between HV and readout sides will be decoupled in ATLAS!

Figure 5: Super-Drawer Test Bench measurements.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|} \hline Module & Mean (V) & RMS (V) & Period \\ \hline LB18\_1 & -1.24 & 0.65 & August 01 \\ \hline LB18\_2 & 0.024 & 0.41 & August 01 \\ \hline EBC38 & -0.75 & 0.67 & August 01 \\ \hline EBA15 & -0.77 & 0.87 & August 01 \\ \hline EBC15 & 0.15 & 0.33 & September 01 \\ \hline EBC24 & 0.023 & 0.65 & September 01 \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 2: Mean values and RMSes of the differences between orders and read HV.

Figure 6: HV configuration for TileCal test beam (H8).

This low voltage problem makes difficult (if not impossible) the estimation of the precision for august runs. An insight can nonetheless be given on the basis of september results (fig 7):

Few things can be deduced from figure 7: most(ie 95%) of the channels are within 1V in precision (this corresponds to 0.17% at 600 V). Furthermore, the channels that show big discrepancies (typically bigger than 0.1%) on the Clermont SD test bench are also singular in test beam conditions (channels 3,11,40 and 41 of EBC24). Moreover, one observes a similar behaviour (on average) between SD test bench and CERN measurements. The differences are to be explained by "external" conditions (low voltage power supplies used, grounding scheme,...).

#### 4.1.2 Stability

Stability of the HV distributor system can be estimated by computing variations around mean values (ie RMSes). Results given on figure 8 for modules EBC15 and EBC24 (september 2001) were extracted from three days of data. One observes that the mean of the RMSes is about 0.03-0.04 V and that the RMS on these values is 0.02-0.03 V. These are actually small values compared to the specifications (0.5% at 600V that is ten times the results seen on figure 8). The system is thus highly stable.

Looking more carefully on the results of EBC24, one observes that the channels that have among the highest RMSes are numbers 4, 11 and 40: they are thus both unstable and suffer from precision problems (see above).

Figure 7: Differences between orders and read HV (in V) for Clermont SD test bench (vertical lines and bullets) and for test beam conditions (horizontal lines and circles).

Stability studies on september 2001 modules were quite easy because low voltage decoupling minimised interventions on the supply feeding the HV distributor system. Nonetheless similar computations can be done for august runs though on much smaller time scales (typically few hours to one day). Nonetheless results are comparable to what was seen in september.

### Other Variables

For a given super-drawer, the value of 68 variables are transmitted though the CANbus by the HVmicro card: in addition to PMT high voltages (see above), one has fixed voltages, temperatures,HV\({}_{in}\) and low voltage values. Let us have a look at the mean results and stability of these quantities.

#### 4.2.1 Fixed voltages

An external voltage reference (1.23 V) of HVopto ADCs is used to track possible drifts of this component. This element is extremely useful with regards to radiations to correct for dose effects (especially photons see [4]). Mean values and RMSes are given in table 3 for september superdrawers. Stability is very high: in three days, the highest RMS is of 0.02% of the mean value. This leads to conclude that the ADCs were highly stable during this period.

Figure 8: HV RMSes for september modules.

#### 4.2.2 Temperatures

There are seven temperature probes per superdrawer: one on the HVmicro card, one on each of the HVopto board, one on each HVbus cards (inside the drawer metal), one near a PMT block (number 22 internal) and the last on the readout side (interface board). All these probes are calibrated on the superdrawer test bench at Clermont. Temperatures are read as frequently as high voltages (every other minutes). Mean values and RMSes are given in tables 4 and 5.

The mean temperatures are about 28-30 degrees on HVmicro cards and 25 to 27 degrees on HVopto boards. The temperature of the drawers themselves are of about 20 degrees and it is a little bit higher inside the PMT block (up to 27.7) or near the interface card (30 to 37 degrees). The stability is furthermore very good for probes located near the drawer: this has to be explained by the conductivity of the aluminium and by the volumes of the drawer: as long as the cooling system is working well, it is quite insensitive to card temperature variations. The other probes (on HVmicro, HVopto and interface boards) are very sensitive to components activity and to power cycling of the low voltages. This is reflect in RMSes obtained in table 5: it is of about 0.5 and 0.1 degrees for HVmicro and Interface respectively. It can go up to 0.8 degrees for HVopto boards.

One may have noticed the higher RMSes for HVopto boards for the august period. This just reflects the fact that high voltages were very often switched on/off at that time: when high voltages are off (ie HV\({}_{in}\)=0) and an order is sent on DACs, regulation loops react to set the order on PMTs with no success since no HV source is available: the results is a high activity of regulation loops and thus an increase in temperature (it can go up to 36 degrees) and currents. It takes about ten minutes for the temperature to stabilise when HV is on.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|} \hline Module & HVopto I & HVopto E & HVmicro & HVbus I & HVbus E & PMT & Interface \\ \hline LB18\_1 & 27.1 & 27.7 & 27.0 & 22.1 & 21.5 & 26.5 & 37.2 \\ \hline LB18\_2 & 26.9 & 27.6 & 30.4 & 21.3 & 20.5 & 22.6 & 32.7 \\ \hline EBC38 & 25.9 & 27.8 & 27.8 & 22.6 & 20.1 & 27.7 & 35.2 \\ \hline EBA15 & 26.7 & 27.9 & 27.4 & 21.4 & 20.8 & 23.3 & 31.4 \\ \hline EBC15 & 24.8 & 28.2 & 29.8 & 21.0 & 20.3 & 24.6 & 33.1 \\ \hline EBC24 & 24.8 & 28.4 & 27.8 & 20.9 & 20.3 & 22.3 & 30.9 \\ \hline \end{tabular}

\end{table}

#### 4.2.3 \(\text{HV}_{in}\)

Source high voltage (coming from Prague power supply) is transmitted to each quarter of SD and digitised periodically. Results are given in table 6.

One observes the very good stability of the HV source at better than the per mil level.

#### 4.2.4 Low Voltages

Three low voltages are necessary for the working of HVmicro and HVopto cards: +5V, +15V and -15V. They are provided by supplies that will be located in the fingers of the modules in UX15. These low voltages are also digitised periodically (see mean values on table 7).

One observes that -15V values are a little bit small for august runs: this is simply due to the fact that the readout side of SD was also using this voltage (and we had only one common source in august). Stability is good: highest RMSes are of 0.06 V for VCC, 0.3 V for +15V and 0.1 V for -15V (the only caveat is for LB18_2: -15V has an RMS of 1 V).

## Conclusions

Results shown in this document indicate that:

* Residuals on HV test bench at Clermont are on average of 0.07 V for ADCs and 0.1 V for DACs.
* Differences between HV orders and read values are on average of -0.1 V with an RMS of 0.7 V on Clermont SD test bench and at CERN: the precision of the system in "realistic" conditions is thus of about 0.2%. Super-Drawer test bench at Clermont and CERN setup gave the same results.
* HV stability was found to be very good at CERN, well within specification (largest RMS:0.14 V whereas 0.5V is allowed).
* Stability of fixed voltages, temperatures, low voltages and HV source were found to be good at CERN.

The differences between what was seen at Clermont (HV test bench) and at CERN is to be explained by "external" conditions (grounding...). Some results are not understood, though: the drift of some channels at CERN was not seen during the calibration step. Investigations are going on at Clermont to clarify this problem. It may be possible anyway that we will have to send the 2001 drawers back to Clermont.
