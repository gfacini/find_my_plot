###### Abstract

Radiation background simulations have been performed using PYTHIA8 and FLUKA for the ATLAS Phase II tracker upgrade at the HL-LHC. A detailed geometry and material description of the proposed LoI inner tracker has been implemented in FLUKA. Fluence and dose predictions in the silicon pixel and strip detector regions are reported. Studies comparing PHOJET and GEANT4 with the baseline simulations are discussed. Previous radiation background studies for the ATLAS inner detector at the LHC show good agreement between measurement and simulation, giving increased confidence in the upgrade predictions.

## 1 Introduction

The radiation environments in and around ATLAS are driven mainly by the particles coming from the proton-proton collisions. The subsequent hadron and electromagnetic particle cascades in the detector, shielding and beamline materials give rise to complex radiation fields comprising a full spectrum of particles (pion, proton, neutron, photon, electron, muon etc) with energies ranging from several TeV down to thermal in the case of neutrons. The deleterious effects of radiation include: damage and ageing of detectors and electronics; fake backgrounds in the selection and reconstruction of interesting physics events; single event upsets causing disruption in the data readout; and radioactivation of components, making access for maintenance difficult. Understanding and being able to predict accurately the radiation backgrounds at the HL-LHC is important for the design of the upgraded detector system.

Advanced Monte Carlo event generator and high-fidelity particle transport codes are necessary for simulating in detail the complex radiation environments. In ATLAS the PHOJET [1] and PYTHIA [2, 3] generators are used for simulating the inelastic proton-proton collisions, which are dominated by soft QCD interactions. The transport and cascade of the collision secondaries throughout the experiment has been performed using the FLUKA [4, 5], FLUGG [6, 7], or GCALOR [8] codes. The original ATLAS radiation background simulations at the LHC were based around PHOJET, FLUKA and GCALOR, for which a detailed description of the studies and predictions can be found in [9]. More recently the ATLAS simulation framework was extended to include FLUGG, a FLUKA interface to the GEANT4 geometry packages, which has updated and improved on many of the original studies, especially for understanding the cavern background issues. Some success has also been achieved in using Athena G4 for simulating radiation backgrounds, though the FLUKA and FLUGG simulations are likely to remain the principal frameworks used for upgrade studies in the near future.

For the past few years, high priority has been given to validating the radiation background simulations for the current ATLAS detector, with the aim of improving the accuracy of the upgrade predictions and reducing safety factors. In the inner detector region, uncertainties in the LHC simulations have been evaluated by comparing the predicted fluences for 7 TeV with the fluences and ionising doses obtained from Pixel, SCT and RadMon measurements using 2011 data. Details of these studies can be found in [10, 11] for the Pixels and [12] for the SCT and RadMons. In general differences throughout the inner detector volume are found to be within 30% for both 1 MeV neq fluences and ionising doses. However there are larger discrepancies in the innermost modules of the SCT end caps (up to a factor of two), the reasons for which are not yet understood. The ratios of fluences obtained from measurement to the simulated FLUKA predictions are shown in Figure 1.

Described in this note are the details of the FLUKA simulations performed for the Phase II inner tracker by the Sheffield ATLAS group. In Section 2 the geometry of the proposed LoI tracker implemented in the FLUKA simulations is described. Also discussed in this section are some comparisons of PYTHIA8 with PHOJET, and FLUKA versus GEANT4. In Section 3 the results obtained from the baseline simulations are given which include the fluence and dose predictions associated with critical regions. Finally, the conclusions are presented in Section 4.

## 2 Inner tracker simulations

The simulation starts with the generation of inelastic proton-proton events. Two main Monte Carlo event generators have been used by ATLAS to simulate the collisions: PYTHIA and PHOJET-1.12/DPMJET-III1. These two MCs have well developed models for describing both the soft and hard QCD components in proton-proton interactions. Minimum bias and diffractive measurements taken at the LHC have allowed tests, tunes and validation of the event generators. Cross-section measurements of the inelasticcollisions have also been made and compared with the MC predictions [13]. The particles from the event generators are fed into the FLUKA or GEANT4 simulation. Accurate modelling of the detector geometry and material is crucial, including the regions outside the inner detector material (e.g., calorimeters, shieldings, beamline equipment).

PYTHIA 8.1 is currently the baseline ATLAS inner detector event generator of choice for radiation background studies due to continued development by the authors to improve the modelling of inelastic proton-proton interactions. However, previous studies were performed with PHOJET 1.12, so it is useful to compare the two. This is discussed further in Section 2.3. FLUKA is the baseline particle transport code of choice since it is well established in simulations of hadronic and electromagnetic cascades in radiation background studies.

The Phase II inner tracker simulations described in this note have been performed using PYTHIA 8.1 to generate 14 TeV proton-proton collisions and FLUKA2011 to transport the particles. From these simulations particle fluences and doses for studying effects on detectors and personnel can be obtained. For example, charged particle fluences are useful for estimating detector occupancies, whereas hadron fluence with energy greater than 20 MeV allows the study of single event upsets. Ionising dose is the quantity of interest for understanding surface damage effects in electronics. Thermal neutrons are important for investigating radioactivation issues. Perhaps the most important quantity of interest in the inner detector regions is the 1 MeV neutron equivalent fluence (\(\Phi_{\mathrm{1\ MeV}}\)), which is needed for determining bulk damage to silicon detectors. These are obtained by weighting the particle spectra with energy dependent

Uncertainties on the measurements are typically \(\sim\) 15% for the pixels and strips, and \(\sim\) 20% for the RadMons. The statistical uncertainties on the simulation are \(\sim\) 3%.

damage curves. Previous inner detector studies on ATLAS have shown that the radiation backgrounds are dominated close to interaction point by particles coming directly from the proton-proton collisions, but at larger radii by particles originating from high energy hadron and electromagnetic cascades in the calorimeters. A full and detailed description of all the radiation background studies performed for ATLAS operation at the LHC can be found in [9].

### FLUKA geometry and material description

The geometry and material description implemented in FLUKA are based on the LoI layout for the inner tracker [14] using details gleaned from GeoModel ATLAS-SLHC-01-03-00 in Athena 17.3.4.3. It consists of a barrel with 4 pixel, 3 short strip and 3 long strip layers (including a stub layer), and end caps with 6 pixel and 7 strip disks. Additionally, the structures and material outside the inner tracker (calorimeters, shieldings, beamline equipment etc) are also modelled; doing so accurately is crucial as secondary interactions form a significant component of the inner tracker radiation backgrounds. The FLUKA model is symmetric about the \(Z=0\) plane and in \(\phi\). The volume elements approximate the locations of materials, and the densities are adjusted to give the correct mass.

Figure 2 illustrates the inner tracker geometry implemented in the FLUKA simulations. The different colours represent different structures as follows:

* **Blue:** Active layers and their associated support structures.
* **Red:** Services for all pixel layers and strip barrel layers.
* **Magenta:** Additional services for strip end cap disks and continuation of pixel and strip barrel layers. These were not implemented in GeoModel as they lay outside the physics tracking region and thus were deemed to have insignificant impact on physics studies. However, they can have significant impact on radiation backgrounds and are thus implemented in FLUKA.
* **Green:** Beampipe, inner support tube and pixel support tube.

More details of the FLUKA geometry and material description can be found in Appendix A.

### FLUKA geometry versus GeoModel

Since the FLUKA geometry has been based on GeoModel, the material distributions should be similar for both of them. This has been cross-checked by comparing the radiation length for FLUKA versus GeoModel, as shown in Figure 3. The distributions match well qualitatively, but display quantitative differences. For \(|\eta|<1.2\), the radiation length for GeoModel is larger than for FLUKA, indicating more material for GeoModel in this region; this issue requires further investigation but is not expected to impact radiation background fluences significantly. For \(|\eta|>1.2\), FLUKA has more material than GeoModel due to the additional services implemented for the strip detector (magenta in Figure 2). The spike at \(|\eta|\approx 2.6\) in the FLUKA distribution is caused by the additional services for the pixel detector which are not implemented in GeoModel.

### PYTHIA 8.1 versus PHOJET

While PYTHIA 8.1 is the baseline event generator of choice, it is useful to compare with PHOJET 1.12 for two reasons. First, all previous results from inner detector FLUKA simulations were obtained with PHOJET, so it provides an important check on changes in predictions. Second, the comparisons allow an estimate of the uncertainties associated with event generator choice.

Shown in Figure 4 is the ratio of PYTHIA 8.1 fluence predictions to those of PHOJET. It can be seen that PYTHIA 8.1 yields higher predictions, especially in the forward regions. However, the differences are typically less than 15%.

### FLUKA versus GEANT4

The FLUKA code is well established in studies of hadronic and electromagnetic cascades in matter, employing advanced physics models for treating interactions for all particles in the keV\(\rightarrow\)TeV range, except for neutrons which are transported down to thermal energies. GEANT4 is the baseline code of choice at the LHC experiments for simulating hard scatter physics processes. There is motivation to use GEANT4 also for future ATLAS upgrade simulations to take advantage of geometry implementation in GeoModel2.

Shown in Figure 5 are examples of fluence energy spectra for photons and neutrons in the inner regions of the ATLAS detector. In both the FLUKA and AthenaG4 simulations the same PYTHIA generated events are used. Pions dominate particle production in the inelastic proton-proton interactions. The high energy photons seen in Figure 5(a) are from the decay of neutral pions--the excellent agreement is expected as most of these pions come directly from the interaction point. This is a useful cross check that the event generator set-up is the same in both simulations. The differences below \(\sim\)20 MeV are photons produced in low energy neutron interactions. Because low energy neutron transport and capture is sensitive to the material description, it is likely that the differences are due to the non-identical detector descriptions implemented in the FLUKA versus AthenaG4 simulations. The lower numbers of low energy (thermal) neutrons seen in Figure 5(b) indicate higher neutron capture reactions in the AthenaG4 simulations, leading to the increased number of the low energy photons seen in the left plot.

Figure 4: Ratio of 1 MeV neq fluences predicted by PYTHIA 8.1 compared to PHOJET.

The discrepancies seen in the high energy neutrons, generated mainly in the calorimeters, are most likely due to differences in the physics models employed by FLUKA and GEANT4.

When convolving the energy spectra with the silicon displacement damage functions to produce 1 MeV neutron equivalent fluences, it was found that differences between the FLUKA and AthenaG4 simulations were typically less than 30%. However, it is seen from the energy spectra that differences of a factor two can be observed at certain energies, and this should be kept in mind when studying the impact of radiation backgrounds on detector systems.

## 3 Results

### 1 MeV neutron equivalent fluences

The 1 MeV neutron equivalent fluences are important for understanding the bulk damage to silicon sensors and can be used to predict leakage currents. The FLUKA predictions of the 1 MeV neq fluences normalised to 3000 fb\({}^{-1}\) of HL-LHC running are shown in Figure 6. Fluence estimates at critical locations in the Pixel detector are tabulated in Table 1; similarly, Table 2 lists fluences for critical locations in the Strip detector.

The maximum 1 MeV neq fluence predictions for 3000 fb\({}^{-1}\) in the pixel system is \(1.4\times 10^{16}\)cm\({}^{-2}\), seen at the centre of the innermost barrel layer. For the outer pixel barrels, the maximum fluence is \(1.7\times 10^{15}\)cm\({}^{-2}\) at the end of layer 3. For the pixel end cap, the maximum is \(1.8\times 10^{15}\)cm\({}^{-2}\) in the inner regions of disk 1. The maximum fluence predictions in the strip barrel detectors are \(5.3\times 10^{14}\)cm\({}^{-2}\) for short strips (layer 1) and \(2.9\times 10^{14}\)cm\({}^{-2}\) for long strips (layer 4). For the strip end cap, the maximum fluence of \(8.1\times 10^{14}\)cm\({}^{-2}\) is seen in the inner regions of disk 7.

For the current LHC inner detector geometry, the 1 MeV neq fluence contours in the Pixel barrel region remain almost parallel along the \(Z\)-direction (see Figure 1); this is because pions from the interaction point dominate the distributions in this region. However, for the LoI upgrade geometry Figure 6 shows that the 1 MeV neq fluence contours are not parallel and a peak is observed near the barrel layer services (\(|Z|\sim 75\) cm). This effect is due to the shorter length of the innermost Pixel layer, leading to longer services. This gives extra mass in this region which leads to more interactions and an increase in neutron production. This effect was also visible in a previous inner tracker layout design (Utopia); see Figure 7. These implications need to be considered during the design evolution of the Phase II tracker.

### Ionising doses

Ionising dose is an important quantity for understanding surface damage effects in electronics. The FLUKA predictions of the ionising dose normalised to 3000 fb\({}^{-1}\) of HL-LHC running are shown in Figure 8. Dose estimates at critical locations in the Pixel and Strip detectors are tabulated in Tables 1 and 2 respectively.

The maximum ionising dose predictions for 3000 fb\({}^{-1}\) in the pixel system is \(7.7\times 10^{6}\)Gy seen at the end of the innermost barrel layer. For the outer pixel barrels, the maximum dose is \(9.0\times 10^{5}\)Gy at the end of layer 3. For the pixel end cap, the maximum is \(1.0\times 10^{6}\)Gy in the inner regions of disk 4. The maximum dose predictions in the strip barrel detectors are \(2.2\times 10^{5}\)Gy for short strips (layer 1) and \(6.3\times 10^{4}\)Gy for long strips (layer 4). For the strip end cap, the maximum dose of \(2.9\times 10^{5}\)Gy is seen in the inner regions of disk 7.

### Charged particle fluences

Charged particle fluences can be used to predict detector occupancies; they are most useful for estimating relative occupancies in the evaluation of new detector layout proposals in comparison with previous designs. An example of using charged particle fluences to estimate detector occupancies can be found in [15]. These occupancy estimates can also be cross-checked with those obtained from tracking studies. The FLUKA predictions of the charged particle fluence per proton-proton collision are shown in Figure 9.

The maximum charged particle fluence predictions per proton-proton collision in the pixel system is \(1.07\times 10^{-1}\)cm\({}^{-2}\) seen at the end of the innermost barrel layer. For the outer pixel barrels, the maximum fluence is \(1.02\times 10^{-2}\)cm\({}^{-2}\) at the end of layer 3. For the pixel end cap, the maximum is

in the inner regions of disk 4. The maximum fluence predictions in the strip barrel detectors are \(2.5\times 10^{-3}\)cm\({}^{-2}\) for short strips (layer 1) and \(6.6\times 10^{-4}\)cm\({}^{-2}\) for long strips (layer 4). For the strip end cap, the maximum of fluence of \(3.3\times 10^{-3}\)cm\({}^{-2}\) is seen in the inner regions of disk 7.

## 4 Conclusions

Radiation background studies for the Phase II ATLAS tracker upgrade have been performed using PYTHIA 8.1 and FLUKA. A detailed geometry and material description of the LoI layout as defined in GeoModel has been implemented. The material distribution of the FLUKA geometry compares well with that from GeoModel, though some differences are observed requiring further investigation. PYTHIA 8.1 is used to take advantage of the latest 7-8 TeV ATLAS minimum bias tunings and predicts fluences up to 15% greater than previous simulations based on PHOJET. The largest differences are seen in the forward regions in the inner detector.

The level of agreement between simulation and measurement in the 7 TeV studies at the LHC has exceeded expectations, with differences typically less than 30%, and always smaller than a factor of two. The verification of the simulations will be repeated for \(\sqrt{s}=14\) TeV, but already confidence in the MC simulation tools for the Phase II tracker upgrade studies has been demonstrated.

There is motivation to use Athena G4 for future ATLAS upgrade simulations to take advantage of the geometry implementation in GeoModel. FLUKA and Athena G4 give similar predictions for the 1 MeV neutron equivalent fluences in the inner detector regions, agreeing typically to 30%, but further study is required to understand differences up to a factor two in the neutron energy spectra.

The highest 1 MeV damage fluences for 3000 fb\({}^{-1}\) are found in the pixel barrel layer closest to the

interaction point, with a maximum predicted \(\Phi_{1\,\mathrm{MeV}}\) value of \(1.4\times 10^{16}\) cm\({}^{-2}\). The outer two layers of the pixel barrel and the pixel disks will use existing silicon planar technology, and a maximum fluence of \(1.7\times 10^{15}\) cm\({}^{-2}\) is predicted (in the third barrel layer). The maximum \(\Phi_{1\,\mathrm{MeV}}\) fluence in the silicon strip system is predicted to be in the end caps (\(z=300\) cm) with a value \(8.1\times 10^{14}\) cm\({}^{-2}\), and in the barrel strip detectors the fluences reach \(5.3\times 10^{14}\) cm\({}^{-2}\). The corresponding values for ionising dose and charged particle fluences have also been presented in this note.
