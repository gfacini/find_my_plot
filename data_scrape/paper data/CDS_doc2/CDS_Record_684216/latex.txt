###### Abstract

A study on the impact of the muon spectrometer alignment on the search for a MSSM Higgs boson A decaying into two muons is reported. Different misalignment sizes and different Higgs masses have been considered. Results on the signal efficiency loss and on the mass measurement are given.

### 1.Introduction

This note is intended to be an extension of the ATL-MUON-2001-001. The same misalignment procedure has been used, together with the standard ATLAS MonteCarlo chain (ATGEN, DICE, ATRECON). The MSSM A\(\rightarrow\)\(\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\) channel is expected to be more sensitive to misalignment with respect to the SM channel. In the MSSM channel there is no Z mass constraint that can be used to rescale the muon momenta. This is particularly true for high values of the Higgs mass. This channel is very important for the discovery of the A boson in the large tan\(\beta\) scenario, where tan\(\beta\) is the ratio between the vacuum expectation values of the two Higgs doublets.

Two different values of M\({}_{\rm A}\) have been considered: 400 and 600 GeV. For each of these values 1200 events have been generated with ATGEN and simulated through the ATLAS detector with DICE and reconstructed with the MUONBOX package.

The method for the Higgs mass reconstruction is explained in section two. Sections three and four contain the results of the impact of misalignment in the Higgs selection efficiency and on the Higgs mass measurement. In section five the conclusions are derived.

### 2.The Higgs mass reconstruction

Two isolated muons with opposite charge are requested. For each muon the following cuts are applied:

\(\bullet\)\(\rm P_{t}\) > 100 GeV;

\(\bullet\)\(\rm\eta\) < 2.5.

The \(\rm P_{t}\) threshold has been set so high to reduce the effect due to multiple scattering on the momentum resolution. The interest of this study is in fact focused on the region where the momentum resolution is dominated by the intrinsic resolution of the muon spectrometer.

The Higgs mass is computed as the invariant mass of the muons that passed the cuts. After this selection the efficiencies are 68% and 63% for M\({}_{\rm A}\)= 600 and 400 GeV respectively.

In all the analysis only the stand-alone muon spectrometer has been used to determine the muon momentum. The tan\(\beta\) value has been chosen to be equal to 15 (the value of tan\(\beta\) has an impact on the width of the A boson).

### 3.Impact of misalignment on the Higgs mass measurement

To deconvolute the effect due to the finite Higgs width, the event-by-event quantity (M\({}_{\rm true}\)-M\({}_{\rm reco}\)), which is defined as the difference between the generated A mass and the reconstructed one, has been used to derive the effect of the misalignment on the Higgs mass measurement. In Table 1 the values of this quantity for M\({}_{\rm A}\) = 400 and 600 GeV for the _systematic_ misalignment are shown.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|r|c|c|c|c|c|} \hline _M GeV_ & _Misalign._ & _None_ & _50_ & _100_ & _200_ \\ \hline
400 & \(<\)Mtrue-Mreco\(>\) & -0.01 +/- 0.46 & 0.4 +/- 0.5 & 0.3 +/- 0.6 & 0.7 +/- 0.8 \\ \hline
400 & sigma & 10.8 +/- 0.5 & 11.6 +/- 0.5 & 13.3 +/- 0.5 & 18.2 +/- 0.8 \\ \hline
600 & \(<\)Mtrue-Mreco\(>\) & 1.5 +/- 0.8 & 1.8 +/- 0.9 & 2.2 +/- 0.8 & 3.5 +/- 2.0 \\ \hline
600 & sigma & 17.2 +/- 0.8 & 18.5 +/- 0.9 & 23.1 +/- 1.0 & 34.4 +/- 2.8 \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 1: Mean value and standard deviation of the Higgs generated mass minus the reconstructed one for three different systematic misalignmentsIn Table 2 the same quantities for the _random_ misalignment are shown.

As it can be noticed both an impact on the mean value and on the width of the Higgs reconstructed mass is visible for _systematic_ misalignment of the order or greater than 100 \(\mathrm{\SIUnitSymbolMicro\meter}\). The effect is higher for the 600 GeV Higgs, since the muons have a higher momentum. The maximum shift for the reconstructed mass is -2 GeV for M\({}_{\mathrm{A}}\)=600 GeV and for a systematic misalignment of 200 \(\mathrm{\SIUnitSymbolMicro\meter}\). The effect on the mass resolution, for the same sample, is an increase of -100% (relative).

The impact on the reconstructed mass value is not visible in the case of a _random_ misalignment, but the increase in width is still present and is of the order of 53% (relative) for a misalignment of 200 \(\mathrm{\SIUnitSymbolMicro\meter}\).

To understand the importance of the reconstructed mass shifts their values should be compared with the expected statistical error on M\({}_{\mathrm{A}}\), which is -1.5/2.0 GeV for 15 < tan(beta) < 30 and M\({}_{\mathrm{A}}\)=400 GeV and an integrated luminosity of -300 fb\({}^{-1}\). It is expected to be higher for a mass of 600 GeV.

### Impact of misalignment on the Higgs selection efficiency

We can define an effective efficiency as the number of events in the mass window [M\({}_{\mathrm{A}}\)\(\pm\)2\(\sigma\)] divided the total number of generated events. For each misalignment M\({}_{\mathrm{A}}\) is taken as the mean value of the reconstructed Higgs mass, while \(\sigma\) is the width of the reconstructed Higgs without any misalignment. In Table 3 the results for the _systematic_ misalignment are shown.

As it can be noticed the maximum loss in efficiency is -28% for a misalignment of 200 \(\mathrm{\SIUnitSymbolMicro\meter}\) and a mass of 600 GeV. For the 400 GeV Higgs this value is of the order of 19%.

In table 4 the results for the _random_ misalignment scenario are given.

The effect is almost the same for the two masses and is smaller if compared to the case of the systematic misalignment. The loss in efficiency becames significant only for misalignments of -200 \(\mathrm{\SIUnitSymbolMicro\meter}\). As an example for the 600 GeV Higgs and for a 200 \(\mathrm{\SIUnitSymbolMicro\meter}\) misalignment the relative loss in efficiency is equal to -15%.

### Conclusions

The impact of the misalignment of the muon spectrometer on the MSSM A\(\rightarrow\)\(\mu^{+}\)\(\mu^{-}\) channel has been studied for different misalignment sizes and different Higgs masses.

For the _systematic_ misalignment scenario a sizable impact on both the mass measurement and the selection efficiency is found with misalignment of the order or greater than 100 \(\upmu\)m.

For the, probably, more realistic _random_ misalignment scenario a relevant impact on the Higgs searches is observed for misalignments greater than or of the order of 200 \(\upmu\)m.
