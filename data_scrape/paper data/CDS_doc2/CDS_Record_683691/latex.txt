###### Abstract

Plastic tubes with channels (profiles) will be used to drive the fibers in the Tilecal calorimeter. Several generations of plastic profiles have been developed in the last two years. These profiles were produced and tested to improve their optical and mechanical properties. The extended barrel modules zero were instrumented with profiles, with a successful insertion of the profiles into the grooves of the modules. But these profiles have not yet optimum optical characteristics. Due to the transparency of about 30-35% a cross-talk between cells of the order of 25-30% was measured in the test beam. Several tests to improve the optical properties of the profiles were done and a transparency smaller than 1% was obtained. The barrel module zero was already reinstrumented in 1998 with this last generation of profiles. We report on the results obtained in the laboratory with these profiles.

Introduction

The Tile Calorimeter is a sampling calorimeter using steel as absorber and scintillator tiles read out by Wave Length Shifter (WLS) fibers as active medium. The Tilecal is a cylindrical structure designed as one barrel and two extended barrel hadron parts. Each cylinder is built of 64 independent modules each one spanning \(2\pi/64\) in azimuth. Mechanically, each module is a periodic structure composed by submodules formed by layers of master steel plates alternating with layers of spacer steel plates and scintillating tiles. Each period, 18mm thick, is composed by a stack of four layers. The first and the third layers are large trapezoidal master plates and the second and fourth layers are formed by scintillator tiles and spacer plates. The tiles alternate with the spacers along the radial direction of the module performing a total of 11 tiles and 11 spacers with different sizes [1]. The second layer is composed by odd sized tiles alternating with even sized spacers and the fourth layer is composed by even sized tiles alternating with odd sized spacers, figure 1.

The scintillating tiles oriented in the R-\(\phi\) plane, perpendicularly to the colliding beams, are read out by WLS fibers. The fibers radially oriented collect the

light from the tiles and transmit it to the photomultipliers in the outer side of the calorimeter.

The optical coupling between the scintillator tiles and the WLS fibers is assured by plastic components [2], named profiles, made out of High Impact Polystyrene (HIPS). The profile cross-section has a closed non-regular shape designed to hold the optical fiber against the edge of the tile and to provide mechanical support, as it is shown in figure 2. The profiles are channels driving the fibers to the PMTs and each profile has space to comport four fibers. The profiles will box into the grooves between two adjacent masters.

Radially the barrel and the extended barrel modules are segmented in three depths or samplings, figure 3, being each sampling divided in cells:

* A-cells in the first sampling;
* BC cells in the second sampling;
* D-cells in the last sampling.

The \(\Delta\eta\times\Delta\phi\) segmentation is 0.1\(\times\)0.1 in the first two samplings and 0.2\(\times\)0.1 in the last sampling. The cells are obtained grouping different fibers reading out tiles with different sizes in the same photomultiplier. Each cell is read out by two photomultipliers, one for each side of the tiles.

Each period includes two groups of four fibers, in the barrel modules and two groups of three fibers in the extended barrel modules. Each tile is read out on each of the two open edges by one fiber and each fiber reads out one or two tiles. To obtain the geometry of a barrel module the tiles are read out, in each period and for each of their two open edges, in the following way:

Figure 2: The profiles: mechanical support and optical coupling.

* A-cells: Tiles #1 and #3 are read out by the same fiber and the tile #2 is read out by another fiber;
* B-sub-cells: Tiles #4 and #6 are read out by one fiber and the tile #5 is read out by another fiber;
* C-sub-cells: Tiles #7 and #9 are read out by one fiber and the tile #8 is read out by another fiber;
* D-cells: The tile #10 is read out by one fiber and the tile #11 is read out by another fiber.

In each period of a extended barrel module and for each open edge, the tiles are read out in the following way:

* A-cells: Tiles #1 and #3 are read out by the same fiber and tile #2 is read out by another fiber;
* BC-cells: Tiles #4 and #6 are read out by the same fiber and tiles #5 and 7 are read out by another fiber;
* D-cells: Tiles #8 and #10 are read out by the same fiber and tiles #9 and #11 are read out by another fiber.

There are profiles with two sizes, one adapted to the sub-periods having a tile with size #1 and the other adapted to the sub-periods having a tile with size #2. The last ones start 1cm before tile #2 and are 9cm shorter:

* Long profiles give support to fibers reading out odd tiles;

Figure 3: The geometry of the barrel (left) and extended barrel (right) modules.

* Small profiles give support to fibers reading out even tiles.

With exception of the last fiber that reads out a tile in a D cell, each fiber after reading the respective tile (or tiles) goes inside the profile to provide optical isolation from the tiles in the subsequent cells, as it is shown in figure 4. The fibers go inside the profiles through holes in the profiles inner wall. For each size of profiles, there are two types of profiles differing one from the other in the position of the holes: one type of profiles will instrument the barrel and the other type the extended barrel modules. The geometry and the routing of the fibers in the extended barrel modules are different from the barrel, namely in the number of fibers per profile, which are only three for the extended barrel modules. See [3, 4] for more details in the routing of the fibers.

The fibers are glued to the profiles near the aluminized end, and are read out in the opposite end by the PMTs.

The plastic material of the profiles has some elasticity in order to allow their boxing into the grooves of the modules by a simple pressure action and an easy insertion and routing of the fibers inside them, figures 2 and 4.

Several generations of plastic profiles have been developed in the last two years. These profiles were produced and tested to improve their optical and mechanical properties.

Figure 4: Scheme of the routing of the fibers into the profiles for the barrel modules. (Not at scale)

The improvement of the mechanical properties of the profiles should lead to profiles with dimensions compatible with the width of the grooves between steel master plates and their tolerances (the cross section is of the order of \(4\mathrm{mm}\times 3\mathrm{mm}\)) and with space to comport four 1mm diameter optical fibers. Because the insertion of the fibers into the profiles will be done by an automated process, additional constraints to the system are imposed, namely, with respect to the flexibility of the material and to the regularity of the dimensions.

The improvement of the optical properties of the profiles should lead to opaque profiles with good diffuser reflectivity for light with wavelength in the blue region to ensure a good collection of the light produced in the tiles and consequently to ensure a good performance of the Tilecal.

## 2 The several generations of profiles

The profiles are channels driving the fibers to the PMTs and are also responsible for the optical coupling between the fibers and the tiles. As channels, the profiles should have space to comport four 1mm diameter fibers and their dimensions should cope with the huge fluctuations of the width of the grooves between the steel master plates [5]. Their shape and dimensions should also provide the tile-fiber optical coupling. These conditions impose many constraints, namely in the thickness and elasticity of the profile walls. As optical components providing the optical coupling between the fiber and the tile, the profiles should have specific optical properties, namely good diffuser reflectivity in the blue range and good opacity. Some of these properties are mutually exclusive and a compromise have to be found.

Preliminary tests in the laboratory on the first profiles had shown a light loss of 10-15% when compared with the situation in which the fiber is surrounded by aluminized mylar in the coupling region. The first tests with profiles in the test beam were done in 1996 in the barrel module zero which was instrumented in the last half of the cell A10 with 16 white profiles. This test allowed to compare the coupling with profiles and the coupling with a piece of aluminized mylar around the contact zone of the fiber with the tile. These measurements showed a light loss of the order of 20% when compared with the situation in which the fiber is surrounded by aluminized mylar in the coupling region [2]. About 10% of the light loss measured is essentially explained by the fact that only about 90% of the scintillator tile was seen by the fiber when these profiles are used (the corners of the profiles in mechanical contact with the tile covered about 10% of the edge). The other 10% of the light loss is most probably due to deficient mechanical contact, to the difference in the reflectivity of the profiles and the reflectivity of the aluminized mylar and to the transparency of the profiles.

The shape and dimensions of the profiles were modified in order to have sharper corners decreasing the contact area between the profile and the tile and getting better mechanical coupling and consequently smaller light losses, figure 5 and table 1.

Table 1: Dimensions of three generations of profiles

Figure 5: The dimensions of the profiles.

In order to instrument the extended barrel modules zero, a new generation of profiles was produced. It was the first generation of profiles able to cope with the huge fluctuations in the width of the grooves of the modules, and with a successful insertion into the modules. The profiles used to instrument the extended barrel modules 0 in 1997, are white HIPS profiles doped with \(TiO_{2}\) to provide good diffuser reflectivity. Higher concentration in \(TiO_{2}\) (good reflectivity) would lead to a loss in the elasticity of the profiles, so a compromise between good reflectivity and proper mechanical properties was necessary.

During the calibration of the modules it was found that the profiles were quite transparent to the light coming from the tiles. A cross-talk of the order of 25-30% between fibers reading out adjacent cells in the same tower was measured in the test beam [6]. What was gained in mechanics was lost in optics.

The measurement of the opacity of the profiles in the laboratory showed a transparency of the order of 30-40%. To reduce this transparency, keeping good reflectivity, while the thickness \(t_{d}\) of the internal surface of the profiles was increased (fig. 5), several other solutions were simultaneously tested, namely:

1. Painting the surface of the profile in optical contact with the tile with: * several types of white inks; * aluminium metallic ink with and without a thin layer of varnish covering the painted surface;
2. Gluing on the surface of the profile in optical contact with the tile: * a white self gluing tape; * a grey self gluing tape; * a strip of self gluing aluminized mylar;
3. Making grey and black profiles and painting the surface of these profiles in optical contact with the tile with a white ink or gluing on this surface a white self gluing tape. The Grey and black profiles are made of HIPS mixed with graphite.

The results obtained with the last generations of profiles are presented in the following sections.

## 3 Painting the profiles

The profiles were painted using several kinds of white ink and aluminium metallic ink with and without a thin layer of varnish covering the painted surface. Almost all the profiles were painted using a standard spray gun mounted on a robot, but some of them in the first tests were painted using a painting brush due to lack of time to prepare the ink and gun.

The several white inks tested include:

* Titanium oxide ink
* Acrylic ink
* Silk-screen print ink
* Ink used in the Traffic Signs (TS ink)

For some of these inks one or more layers of ink was tested. One layer of ink is about 30\(\mu\)m thick, two layers is about 70\(\mu\)m thick and three layers about 120\(\mu\)m thick.

## 4 Experimental setup

**The reflectivity of the profiles**

To have a measurement of the reflectivity of the profiles a horizontal plate fixed in a X-Y table was used. The plate has 33 V-shaped grooves with space to receive one fiber per groove [7]. The test bench is schematically shown in figure 6. It consists of a X-Y micro-control table provided with two independent movements along orthogonal directions (X and Y). The Y motor displaces a \({}^{90}Sr\) radioactive source along the fiber length. The fibers are excited with light coming from an injected molded scintillator tile excited by the \({}^{90}Sr\) source. A 30cm long profile was placed on the grooves of the fibers holder and a 100cm long fiber aluminized at one end was put on the profile. The fiber-profile set was fixed to the table. The fiber was excited by the scintillator tile in the region of the profile and the light collected by the fiber was read out by a PMT in one of its ends.

**The effects of the mechanical contact between the fibers and the black profiles on the transmission of light**

The same setup was also used to measure the possible light loss due to the mechanical contact of the fiber with the inner side of the walls of the black profiles. To have a measurement of this light loss one 150cm long profile was filled with three 160cm long fibers and put under the pressure of lead bricks. Five 10cm long bricks were used, with a total weight of about 15Kg. The lead bricks ensured a tight contact fiber/profile. The central fiber, inside the profile, was coupled to a PMT and excited near the opposite end by light coming from the scintillator excited by the \({}^{90}Sr\) source (figure 6). Measurements were taken, alternating this setup with the situation in which the profile was removed (no profile around the fiber or mechanical pressure).

**The opacity and collection of light with profiles**

The setup used to measure the collection of light and the opacity of the profiles is shown in figure 7. A scintillating tile wrapped with a \(TYVEK^{\circledR}\) sheet was excited by a \({}^{90}Sr\) source in a fixed point close to the read out fiber. The tile is read out in one of its open edges by a WLS fiber which is read out by a PMT.

Figure 6: Experimental setup to measure the reflectivity of the profiles.

The optical and the mechanical coupling between the fiber and the scintillating tile was ensured by a profile. The opposite open edge was covered by a piece of aluminized mylar.

The scintillating light produced by the tile was measured inserting the fiber in four different positions of the profile, as it is shown in figure 7.

The several profiles were measured using the same setup.

## 5 Results

The first operation was to check the reproducibility of the setup shown in figure 7, namely with respect to the measurement of the collection of light and to the measurement of the transparency of the profiles.

After testing the reproducibility of the setup several profiles were measured.

Figure 7: Schematic view of the experimental setup: opacity and collection of light. On the right top it is shown the cross section of the profiles with the four fibers in their positions.

### Reproducibility

To access the reproducibility of the setup with respect to the measurement of the light collection, one profile with one fiber was tested several times. The light seen by the fiber that is directly coupled to the tile was recorded, allowing to see the fluctuations in the light output of the system. To test the reproducibility of the setup with respect to the measurement of the opacity of the profiles the same measurements were done but with the read out fiber in the central positions 1 and 3 of the profile (figure 7). The values obtained are shown in figure 8.

The distributions have a rms of 2.1% and 7.8% for the measurements of the collection of light and transparency of the profiles, respectively, which indicates that these measurements have a reproducibility of these orders of magnitude.

### Opacity, reflectivity and collection of light

The collection of the light produced by the scintillator tiles with the WLS fibers when the optical coupling between the two components is assured by profiles depends at least of two parameters:

* The mechanical coupling;
* The reflectivity of the surface of the profile in optical contact with the tiles.

Figure 8: Reproducibility of the setup. Left side: Measurement of the collection of light. Right side: Measurement of the transparency of the profiles.

The measurement of the reflectivity of the profiles was done as described before (figure 6), and the results are shown in table 2. The values shown are relative values: all the measurements were performed relatively to the reference profile, which was set equal to 100%. All the profiles are painted with TS white ink, with exception of two profiles: the reference profile and the last profile in the table. The reference profile is a sample of the profiles used to instrument the extended barrel modules zero in 1997; the last profile in the table is a black profile without ink or tape. The profile before the last is a black profile with a non-uniform layer of white ink showing a non-uniform white colour on the painted surface.

Table 2 shows that all the profiles painted with white ink have essentially the same reflectivity for the blue light of the scintillator, if painted with a uniform layer of TS white ink. This reflectivity is of the same order of magnitude of the reference profile. The reflectivity of the profiles is also independent of the number of layers of ink, depending only on the uniformity of the layer. The profile before the last shows a non-uniform white colour on the painted surface and the respective reflectivity is only 93.7% of the reference value.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{||c||c||} \hline \hline Profile & Reflectivity \\  & \% \\ \hline \hline Reference & 100 \\ White with white ink-2 layers & 100.0 \\ Grey with white ink (sample 1) & 99.2 \\ Grey with white ink (sample 2) & 103.7 \\ Grey with white ink-2 layers (sample 1) & 101.1 \\ Grey with white ink-2 layers (sample 2) & 107.5 \\ Grey with white ink-3 layers & 100.9 \\ Black with white ink-1 layer & 100.0 \\ Black with white ink-2 layers & 101.1 \\ Black with white ink-1 layer & 99.4 \\ Black with white ink (sample 1) & 100.8 \\ Black with white ink (sample 2) & 100.2 \\ Black with white ink (sample 3) & 100.9 \\ Black with white ink (sample 4) & 93.7 \\ Black without ink & 68.6 \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 2: Diffusor reflectivity of the profiles painted with white ink used in the Traffic Signs (TS ink).

To measure the collection of light using profiles, the light output was measured putting the fiber in optical contact with the tile, i.e., fiber in position 1 as shown in figure 7. The transparency of the profiles was measured with the fiber inside the profile in each one of the three positions 2, 3 and 4, with no fiber in position 1. To calculate the transparency of the profiles, the light collected by the fiber inside the profile was divided by the light collected by the same fiber in the position 1, in the respective profile. Each piece of profile was measured several times. The values obtained are shown in table 3. The reference profile is a sample of the profiles used to instrument the extended barrel modules zero, in 1997, as before. The first column of the table shows measurements relative to the reference profile that was set equal to 100%.

For the tested inks, the TS white ink (ink used in the Traffic Signs) seems to be the most promising one because shows the best adherence to the profiles and the best mechanical resistance. The Silk-screen ink and the white ink of type B present a fast mechanical damage with the time.

The self gluing tapes show an important disadvantage relatively to the ink, because the process of drill the surface of the profile is much harder with self gluing tape than with ink. The aluminized mylar glued on the surface of the profile has an additional disadvantage relatively to the tape because the elasticity of the mylar produces a curvature on the profile during the process of gluing. This curvature can deteriorate the tile/fiber optical coupling at least in some regions along the profile leading to large fluctuations in the quality of this optical coupling.

The measurements performed showed that all the profiles with 5 exceptions (profiles with aluminized ink, profiles with a grey self gluing tape and grey and black profiles with nothing) have a better light collection than the profile used to instrument the extended barrel modules zero. This improvement in the collection of light is in the range 2% and 19%. At least for the painted profiles the improvement in the collection of light is mainly due to the modifications in the shape of the profiles, figure 5 and table 1, and to the better coupling obtained in the laboratory with these modifications, as we can conclude from the comparison of tables 2 and 3. The collection of light with grey and black profiles with an uniform layer of white ink is the same.

The transparency of the profiles decreased significatively with an increase of the number of layers of white ink. Several types of white inks were tested and with the exception of the acrylic ink, all of them showed similar improvements on the opacity of the profiles. For the TS white ink we obtained a transparency of the order of 4% for white profiles. The grey profiles painted with white ink showed a transparency smaller than 1% and the black profiles are opaque. The profiles showed the same transparency in the two lateral positions 2 and 4, shown in figure 7.

Table 3: Collection of light and transparency of the profiles.

The effects of the mechanical contact between the fibers and the black profiles on the transmission of light

The fibers that read out the first two samplings of the Tilecal, after reading the respective tile (or tiles) go inside the profiles. To study the possible light losses due to the mechanical contact of the fibers with the walls of the black profiles tests were done exciting the fiber in one of its ends and measuring the light collected by the fiber in the opposite end after running about 150cm inside a black profile. The measurements were done with the fiber in tight contact with the profile and without profile. The contact was assured by the pressure of 15kg lead bricks on the 150cm long profile, as it is described in section 4. These tests did not show any significative light loss. After 13 measurements, the light output ratio \(\frac{I_{width\ profile}}{I_{without\ profile}}\) is 0.99\(\pm\)0.01, and the maximum loss seen in an individual measurement was 2.5%.

## 6 Gluing the fibers to the profiles

To keep the fibers always in the same position, they are glued to the profiles on an extension of about 5mm. The fibers are glued to the profiles just near the aluminized ends of the fibers.

There are several requirements on the glue to be used:

1. The interaction of the glue with the cladding of the fibers should be small in order to do not deteriorate the optical properties of the fibers and minimize the light loss in the glued region;
2. The glue should keep its properties for a long period of time and should be radiation hard;
3. The glue should have a fast cure time, of the order of a few seconds, because the insertion of the fibers into the profiles and their gluing will be done by an automated process.

In order to make a choice, several glues were tested, namely:

* UHU allpast
* Loctite 401
* Loctite 420
* Loctite Super Attack gel
* Loctite Super Attack liquid

(all the Loctite glues in the table are cyanoacrylate contact glues.)

### Experimental setup

To study the interaction of each glue with the cladding of the fibers, and the consequent light loss several fibers were glued to 1cm pieces of profiles.

The small pieces of profiles were glued to 125cm long fibers in a small region near the middle of the fiber (about 98cm far from the read out end of the fiber). The extension of the contact area between the glue and the fiber is of the order of 0.5cm, that is the order of the expected extension of the gluing areas of the fibers to the profiles in the barrel module zero. The setup used to measure the light loss due to the glue is shown in figure 6.

As it was said before, the support of the fibers in the experimental setup is a plate with 33 V-shaped grooves with space to receive one fiber per groove. Twelve fibers plus the reference fiber in the middle of the table were measured per table. The fibers were ordered in the table alternating filled grooves with one fiber with empty grooves. The first 6 fibers in the plate are reference fibers without glued pieces of profiles, to control the stability of the measurements. These fibers were measured several times, once per measurement. The other 6 fibers are fibers for the tests of the glues.

The fibers are excited by light coming from a scintillator. One of the ends is read out by a PMT and the other end is painted with black ink. The light read out by the PMT is only light that propagates in its direction. The light propagating in the direction of the painted end is not reflected back to the PMT. The fiber is excited in many points at different distances from the PMT allowing a longitudinal scan of the fiber. The longitudinal scan was done, for each fiber, with a step of 5cm. The region with glue was avoided.

### Results

To measure the effects of the glue in the response of the fibers, each fiber was scanned without and with a small piece of profile glued on its surface, as it is shown for a set of 6 fibers in figure 9.

The effects of the glues in the transmission of light was measured calculating the ratio:

\[R=\frac{\left(\frac{I_{i}(x_{k})}{I_{i}(x_{j})}\right)_{with\ profile}}{ \left(\frac{I_{i}(x_{k})}{I_{i}(x_{j})}\right)_{without\ profile}} \tag{1}\]

where \(I_{i}(x)\) is the light collected by the PMT when the fiber i is excited at a distance x from the PMT. If there is no light loss due to the glue the ratio will be 1.

The ratio R was calculated for \(x_{j}\)=55cm and \(x_{k}\)=115 and 120cm, where \(x_{j}\) is a point closer to the PMT than the glued piece of profile and \(x_{k}\) is a point farther the PMT than the glued piece of profile. The ratio \(\frac{I_{i}(x_{k})}{I_{i}(x_{j})}\) is calculated before and after the gluing of the piece of profile on the fiber.

Figure 10 shows the results obtained for two of the tested glues and table 4 summarizes the results obtained for all the tested glues.

As we can see from the table, between the glues tested, the cyanoacrylates are much faster, with cure times of the order of 10 seconds. The light losses due to all the Loctite glues are of the same order of magnitude. In average the light loss in the glued region is almost zero. For the Loctite Super Attack Gel glue there is an average light loss of (2.0\(\pm\)1.5)%. For this glue the maximum light loss measured in a sample of 12 fibers is about 5%. For the liquid Loctite glues the maximum light loss are of the order of 3% (as we can see from the last column of the table 4).

## 7 Summary

In order to decrease the transparency of the profiles and to improve the collection of light several solutions were tested. Three colors of profiles (white, grey and black) with self gluing tapes of many types or aluminized mylar glued on its internal surface or painted in the same surface with several types and layers of white inks were tested. The tests with the self gluing tapes and the aluminized

mylar revealed an important disadvantage relatively to the inks: the process of drilling the holes in the profiles will be much harder with self gluing tapes or with aluminized mylar. Between the several tested white inks the most promising one is the TS white ink that shows the best adherence to the profile and the best mechanical resistance.

All the painted profiles show the same reflectivity if painted with a uniform layer of white ink as the white profiles used to instrument the two extended barrel modules zero in 1997. The light loss due to non-uniformities on the painting are more important in the black profiles because their intrinsic reflectivity is smaller. The black profiles without any ink showed a reflectivity about 30% smaller than the white profiles of 1997. The reflectivity of the grey profiles with no ink is about 12% better than the reflectivity of the black profiles.

The collection of light with the grey and black profiles painted with a uniform layer of white ink increased about 10% relatively to the collection of light with the profiles used to instrument the extended barrel modules, as measured in laboratory. This improvement in the collection of light is most probably due to the improvement of the mechanical coupling between the fiber and the tile.

With respect to the opacity, the black profiles are the best, because they are opaque. The grey profiles without any ink show a transparency of the order of 8% and with one or more layers of ink their transparency is smaller than 1%.

Tests of the possible light losses due to the mechanical contact of the fibers with the unpainted inner side of the walls of the black profiles showed that there is no significative loss of light when the black profiles are used instead of white profiles.

To choose the profiles to instrument the barrel module zero several parameters were evaluated, namely, the collection of light, transparency and possible light loss resulting from the mechanical contact of the fibers inside the black profiles with them. The black and grey profiles painted with white ink in the surface in optical contact with the tile are the most promising ones. There are two disadvantages related with the black profiles:

* The possibility to obtain a worse performance in the collection of light if the layer of white ink has non-uniformities or if this layer suffer some mechanical damage;
* The black profiles are completely opaque to the visible light, so the check of the routing of the fibers in the modules in order to obtain the correct geometry will be harder with these profiles.

The black profiles with a layer of TS white ink about 40\(\mu\)m thick were chosen to instrument the barrel module 0 in 1998 and about 140 grey profiles with an equal layer of TS white ink were used to instrument the last half (larger \(\eta\) values) of the two last A cells (A9 and A10) in both halfs of the module. This will allow a comparative test of the performance of the grey and the black profiles with a uniform white paint.

The fibers are glued to the profiles on an extension of about 5mm, and a glue had to be chosen. The tests with four Loctite glues show a maximum light loss in the glued region of the order of 3%. Due to its viscosity the Super Attack gel Loctite glue was chosen to glue the fibers to the profiles in the barrel module 0, in 1998.
