###### Abstract

Results of the experimental study of the induced radioactivity generated by neutron irradiation in the semiconductor tracker end-cap module are presented. The purpose of the experiment was to identify the radioisotopes produced in the module by neutron interactions. The irradiation was done in the active zone of the VR-1 CTU Prague reactor. The identification and quantification of radioisotopes were based on detailed analysis of gamma-ray spectra, which were measured with a HPGe-detector. The nuclear processes of all 26 observed radioisotopes and their activities at the end of the irradiation were determined.

## 1 Introduction

The LHC (Large Hadron Collider [1]) is under construction at CERN. The start of operation of the LHC is planned for 2007 and several experiments will use its capability. ATLAS (A Toroidal LHC Apparatus [2]) is a general-purpose detector that will exploit the full potential of the proton-proton collision program at the LHC. The ATLAS detector is composed of several sub-detectors organized in three layers. The closest layer to the interacting point is the ID (Inner Detector). This detector permits to measure particle tracks with high precision. The second and third layers are the system of calorimeters and muon detectors, respectively. The ID is composed of three parts as well: the Pixel, the SCT (Semiconductor Tracker), and the TRT (Transition Radiation Tracker). The SCT holds position-sensitive detectors located on disks (SCT end-cap) and barrels (SCT barrel). This work focuses on the silicon microstrip detectors of the SCT end-cap (Fig. 1, this part of the end-cap will be referred to as the module in the following).

In order to find "new" physics, the ATLAS detector has to suppress the background signals. One of the background sources, which could degrade the ID performance, is the signal caused by the neutron-induced

## 2 Experimental setup and data analysis procedure

Prior to the irradiation procedure, the module was fixed to a Perspex plate 5 mm thick and both were waterproof wrapped. Subsequently, two monitors (gold foils of 1/2" diameters and mass 128 mg) were glued on the wrapping to obtain the integral neutron flux. After this preparation, the module has been irradiated in the active zone, filled with heavy water, of the CTU Prague training reactor [3] at a distance of 3 cm from the fuel elements. The irradiation session was done with full reactor power (neutron flux \(\sim 10^{8}\) n.cm\({}^{-2}\).s\({}^{-1}\)) during 165 min. After the irradiation process was completed, the module was then withdrawn from the irradiation area, removed from the wrapping, separated from the Perspex plate, and placed on a gamma-spectrometer.

Spectra of gamma rays were measured with a shielded HPGe detector. The spectra were saved in real-time periods: firstly in the increasing sequence 1, 2, 4, 8, 15, 30, 60, 120, and 240 minutes. Then 21 measurements of fixed duration of 240 minutes were done. Within the first four days after the irradiation, thirty spectra were stored. Fig. 2 shows examples of gamma-ray spectra acquired for different times after irradiation to present gradually decreasing activity, as well as the background spectrum.

In the data analysis procedure, the method used for the identification and for the assignment of the final activities (activity at the end of the irradiation) of the radioisotopes generated in the module is described in detail. Two parameters (gamma-ray energy and half-life) have been taken into account during the spectrum processing to obtain proper identification of the radioisotopes.

The final activity \(A_{f,i}\) [Bq] of the \(i^{th}\) radioisotope is given by:

\[A_{f,i}=A_{i,j}\times 2^{\frac{t_{d,j}}{t_{1/2,i}}}, \tag{1}\]

where \(A_{i,j}\) [Bq] is the activity of the \(i^{th}\) radioisotope at the beginning of the \(j^{th}\) gamma-ray measurement, \(t_{d,j}\) [s] is the decay period between the end of the irradiation and the start of the \(j^{th}\) gamma-ray measurement, \(t_{1/2,i}\) is the half-life of the \(i^{th}\) radioisotope. The relationship between the activity \(A_{i,j}\) and the peak area \(S_{i,j}\) of the \(i^{th}\) radioisotope in the \(j^{th}\) gamma-rays measurement is given by

Figure 2: Examples of spectra of the gamma rays emitting from the irradiated module after **a)** 1 minute, **b)** 9 minutes, **c)** 17 minutes, and **d)** 3 days from the end of irradiaition. The last spectrum **e)** shows the background measured by HPGe detector.

\[A_{i,j}=\frac{S_{i,j}\times ln(2)}{I\times\epsilon\times t_{1/2,i}\times\left(1-2^{ -\frac{t_{m,j}}{t_{1/2,i}}}\right)}, \tag{2}\]

where \(I\) is the intensity of the gamma transition, \(\epsilon\) the efficiency of the HPGe detector for different gamma rays, and \(t_{m,j}\) [s] the time of the \(j^{th}\) gamma-ray measurement. The efficiency \(\epsilon\), which varies with gamma-ray energy, was obtained by the measuring with a calibrated source of \({}^{152}\)Eu and by fitting the relation \(\epsilon\left(E\right)=a\times E^{-b}\), where E is energy of the gamma rays, a and b are constants determined from the fit. The resulting efficiency curve was precisely calculated up to the maximum energy of \({}^{152}\)Eu (appr. 1.5 MeV). The efficiency for higher energies was determined by extrapolating the fitted relation.

The calculation mentioned above treats the module as a punctual source. Such approximation to the dimension of the module (9 \(\times\) 17 cm\({}^{2}\)) causes systematic error which was partly suppressed by putting the module 32.5 cm away from the detector. The systematic error was determined by independent measurement to be (7.5 \(\pm\) 1.5 %). This error was included in the results.

The activity of two gold foils were used to monitor the neutron flux \(\Phi\) [cm\({}^{-2}\).s\({}^{-1}\)]. The relation between the flux and the final activity \(A_{f,Au}\) is given by

\[\Phi=\frac{A_{f,Au}}{\sigma\times N\times\left(1-2^{-\frac{t_{a}}{t_{1/2,Au}} }\right)}, \tag{3}\]

where \(\sigma\) [cm\({}^{2}\)] is the thermal neutron cross-section, N number of target atoms, t\({}_{a}\) [s] the activation time. The number N was obtained by using the equation

\[N=\frac{m\times N_{A}}{A}, \tag{4}\]

where m [g] is the mass of the gold monitor, \(N_{A}\) [mol\({}^{-1}\)] the Avogadro number and A [g.mol\({}^{-1}\)] the atomic weight.

The full process (irradiation, gamma-ray spectra measurement, and data processing) was repeated three times with the same module to verify the obtained results. The results of all three processes are in agreement.

## 3 Experimental results and discussion

The neutron flux entering the module was determined to be \((7.2\pm 0.2)\times 10^{8}cm^{-2}.s^{-1}\) by using the Eqs. (3) and (4). By precise analysis of all 30 spectra, 26 radioisotopes were observed. The dominant peaks in the gamma-ray spectra are 411 keV, 511 keV, and 1 779 keV (see Fig. 2). The first peak is caused by the 

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:4]

presence of gold in the module and gradually becomes even more dominant due to the long half-life of the gold radioisotope. The second peak is from the annihilation process following \(\beta^{+}\) decays, mostly from \({}^{64}\)Cu. The third peak is from the \({}^{28}\)Al radioisotope which has short half-life and gradually disappears from the spectra.

Our results are summarized in Tab. 1. This table contains 26 identified radioisotopes and their half-lifes, measured activities, and references to Tab. 2 summarising their decay processes [4]. Furthermore, Tab. 2 presents the cross section \(\sigma\) [barn] of thermal neutron capture, the resonance integral RI [barn], the reaction energy Q [keV], the half-life \(t_{1/2}\) [s,m,h,d], and the main gamma-rays energies produced in the disintegration together with the gamma-rays yield in brackets. The dominant disintegration processes are beta decay; the rest are electron captures.

In activation studies, there are two tasks: background determination and dosimetry. There are two types of gamma rays - prompt and delayed. From the point of view of the background study, both types of gamma rays are important. Since the decay energies are relatively high (up to 5.5 MeV for \({}^{24}\)Na), the emitted beta particles could cause a significant background signal in the position sensitive detectors which would be undistinguishable from the signal of charged particles produced in proton-proton collisions. On the other hand, for the dosimetric study, only delayed gamma rays are important.

The total activity of the module is relatively high. This activity is related to either short-lived nuclei (half-life of minutes up to less than 12 hours) or nuclei with long half-life (more than 12 hours). In the longer-lived radioisotopes, the most important nuclei are \({}^{64}\)Cu (T\({}_{1/2}\) = 12.7 h, A\({}_{f}\) = 2 MBq, E\({}_{\gamma}\) = 1 346 keV), \({}^{124}\)Sb (T\({}_{1/2}\) = 60.2 d, A\({}_{f}\) = 73 Bq, E\({}_{\gamma}\) = 603, 723, 1 691 keV), \({}^{24}\)Na (T\({}_{1/2}\) = 15.0 h, A\({}_{f}\) = 37 kBq, E\({}_{\gamma}\) = 1 369, 2 754 keV), and \({}^{198}\)Au (T\({}_{1/2}\) = 2.7 d, A\({}_{f}\) = 35 kBq, E\({}_{\gamma}\) = 412, 676, 1 088 keV). Such long-term activities will require a strict safety protocol.

We observed also a 1 273.3 keV gamma line, in gamma-ray spectra. It suggests that this line could belong to the radioisotope \({}^{29}\)Al. However, such radioisotope cannot be produced by neutron capture in the reactor. Its origin has to be caused by another nuclear reaction, which could also be important from background point of view. Examples of such reactions are given in Tab. 3.

## 4 Conclusion

Our experiment with the end-cap module proved the necessity of taking into account the activation of these modules. The results showed that 26 radioisotopes, some of them long lived, are generated during irradiation by the thermal neutron flux. As a next step we will simulate our experiment by Monte-Carlo methods. The results of these simulations will serve to estimate the induced background in end-cap modules in the full ATLAS geometry, as well as, to calculate the induced radioactivity regarding radiation protection.
