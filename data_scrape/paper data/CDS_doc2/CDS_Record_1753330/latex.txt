Introduction

This report describes the development of an edge-mounting mechanism for the interface between a stave and its support cylinder for the barrel strip staves of the phase II ATLAS upgrade [1]. As a direct product of the prototyping programme undertaken, we have also developed the tooling required to mount the components of the mechanism to their respective structures.

The design has been conceived to be compatible with tilt angles as low as 10\({}^{\circ}\) for the nominal module envelope, and meet the positioning and stability requirements whilst having an acceptably small contribution to the total material in the tracker volume. In order to reach these goals, the tooling for stave insertion was designed to be completely removable and respects the clearances of pre-installed staves.

The report begins by summarising the requirements for the stave mounting system and presents the general philosophy for the single edge mounting system. We then describe the details of the components which make up the edge mounting system including the z=0 and z=1.3m fixations and the intermediate locking points. We move on to describe the tooling which has been developed to mount these components onto the structural elements (cylinders and staves) and the tooling required to insert staves onto their supporting cylinders.

A major part of this work was the design and construction of a three-stave mock-up of the innermost cylinder which has been used to verify the stave insertion procedures. The assembly of this prototype is described in detail and the results of several insertion trials are presented. In particular we show measurements of the out-of-plane deviation of the stave trajectory as it is inserted onto the cylinder and as the intermediate locking points are activated.

To evaluate the stability of the edge-mounting system we have investigated the thermal deformations and frequency response of a stave mounted onto a custom-manufactured ultra-stable Invar base-plate using Electronic Speckle Pattern Interferometry (ESPI) and a capacitive sensor displacement system.

Finally we present a detailed calculation of the radiation-length contribution of the edge mounting system components to the total material in the tracking volume. Based upon the success of the prototyping and by simulating the performance of the intermediate mounting points in FEA we present an improved design utilising approximately 50% of the material in the original intermediate locking points whilst retaining adequate performance.

In conclusion, we have developed a low-mass edge mounting system capable of meeting the stability requirements and allowing insertion down to a tilt angle of 10\({}^{\circ}\) with the assumed stave envelope.

Design philosophy

The prime constraints for the stave support system are low mass and the limited space available. We believe that the most promising approach to address these is by fixing only one edge to the support cylinder. Our design avoids structural elements between neighbouring staves so that the tilt angle is limited only by the intrinsic thickness of the staves and the components on it (possibly as little as \(10^{\circ}\) depending on the layout of components on the stave).

The stave fixation is an important part of the overall strip support structure and must not compromise the overall stiffness requirements. Pure edge-mounting along one edge only does not satisfy this. We therefore propose to also constrain the outer stave corners at the two ends to limit the rotation around the fixed edge.

The ability to provide active locking is an important feature of this edge-mounting locking mechanism design as this provides a firm and stable support to the staves. While track-based alignment makes positioning of detector elements with ultimate precision for tracking purposes less stringent, we believe in the need to "key in" the stave position with precision surfaces to guarantee build tolerances for overlaps and mechanical and electrical clearances, and to maintain long-term stability.

Consideration was also given to allow the stave to slide longitudinally to reduce any mechanical stress due to its thermal movement despite it being in a locked position.

Within these constraints the main consideration for the fixation design for the barrel strip staves is the requirement to allow the stave to be inserted and removed from the strip barrel ends at all angular positions and radii with no access, physically or visually, to the inside of the barrel, and within the limited space of the Outer Cylinder. Reliability and simplicity are therefore further key design drivers. Insertion and removal of a stave must not be affected by the presence of staves in the adjacent locations.

Accurate alignment of the locks is a vital part of the design as any misalignment will cause undue stresses to the stave. A lot of attention has been paid to ensure that the right tooling is used to assemble and glue these locks onto the cylinder and the staves to meet the tight tolerance limits. Due to the difficulties with machining large-scale composite structure accurate positioning of fixation elements is achieved by gluing components on the support structures using precision jigs, rather than machining.

## 3 Requirements

**Stability:** As outlined in ref. [2] stability is the most critical positioning requirement for the tracker, with a stability in the bending plane of 2um, and 20um in other directions, required over short periods (order 1d). The main loads during this time-scale are thermal variations and external vibrations. The former are difficult to predict, but should be addressed by controlling variations of the heat load and sink temperature. Once these variations are better understood their impact on the structural stability will need to be studied. To understand the impact of external vibration its magnitude needs to be known. We are currently setting up a measurement of the vibration spectrum in the ATLAS barrel calorimeter cryostat during the current long shutdown (LS1). Without this information we estimate that the acceleration spectral density (ASD) will not exceed 10\({}^{7}\)\(g^{2}\)/Hz. Simple estimates using Miles' equation show that for such a base vibration ASD an RMS displacement of 1um (10um) or below is achieved for simple CF beam structures with a typical \(Q\) value of 12.5 with a first mode frequency of 50Hz (10Hz) or above.

**Multiple scattering material:** While material minimization is always a key requirement for the design of the tracker and its support structure the detailed allocation of the material to different components of the tracker is notoriously badly defined. The multiple scattering material goal for the ATLAS barrel strip system is 2.8%X per layer, with 1.98%X expected to be taken by the stave including modules [3]. For the fixation mechanics we strive to achieve a system well below 0.2%X\({}_{0}\) (excluding components at the barrel end) averaged over the acceptance of a layer.

Reducing the tilt angle will reduce the effective material per layer (by roughly 1% per degree). We therefore require a maximum tilt angle of 12\({}^{\circ}\), with a preference for smaller angles if achievable (for a stave envelope of 15mm over the active area, and 1mm active area overlap for 1GeV/c tracks).

**Placement accuracy:** To maintain overlaps and provide mechanical and electrical clearances we require that the staves are positioned to \(\pm\)100um in the \(r\)-\(\varphi\) plane.

**Separation of staves adjacent in \(\varphi\):** The clearances available for the staves are a result of the geometrical interplay between the tilt angle, the active radius and the separation between adjacent staves. For the purpose of this document we require 1mm overlap with two hits per stave (four per layer) for 1GeV/c tracks), which is conservative. Should we decide at a later point that a relaxed requirement (for example overlap with only one hit per stave) is sufficient to guarantee enough overlaps for the alignment and coverage the separation for staves and with it the clearances will increase. For the purpose of illustration we use a 15mm envelope for the stave and electronics in the sensor area in this document (Figure 1). For comparison, the current design for the final stave thickness including tapes is 5.5mm, and the thickness of the stave including the maximum wire bond height is expected to be 10.04mm. The 15mm envelope used here gives a clearance of 2.48mm for insertion and fixation per side.

**Z-constraint:** The staves shall be anchored in \(z\) at one position. The stress introduced to the stave by differential thermal expansion between 20\({}^{\circ}\)C and -50\({}^{\circ}\)C should be limited by allowing other locking points to slide.

**Functionality:** The fixation mechanics should be compatible with end insertion into or removal from the support structure at every location (every angle) with no physical or visual access to the inside of the barrel strip system, and within the constraints of the Outer Cylinder.

Figure 1: Stave separation requirements (innermost barrel strip layer). The 15mm envelope includes a 4.96mm clearance for fixation and insertion, as described in the text.

## 4 Design

### ATLAS barrel strip tracker geometry

A description of the geometry for the ATLAS upgrade can be found in ref. [2]. For reference a drawing of the barrel strip tracker is given in Figure 2.

Due to the different radii and effective overlap constraints the local geometry changes between the different layers (Figure 3), resulting in slightly different space constraints on the fixation mechanics. As a consequence the design of the fixation parts on the support cylinders will differ slightly for the different cylinders. However, the design for the components attached to the stave will be the same for all staves, so that no differences between staves are introduced.

### Edge-mounting design overview

The edge-mounting design consists of a number of intermediate locking points along the inner edge of the stave and fixation points at each end. Each fixation or locking point consists of a part on the stave and a mating part or assembly on the support structure. The components on the barrel within the barrel volume (all but the fixations at the barrel end, \(z\)=1.3m) are glued onto the outside of the support cylinders before the integration of the support cylinders into the barrel support structure. The components on the staves are glued onto the staves as part of the stave assembly process. The exact design of the \(z\)=1.3m fixations is not yet clear as it will be strongly influenced by the design of barrel end flanges and interlinks, but most likely they will be referenced to the end flanges with dowelled joints.

Originally, the designs of the locking mechanics used an anchor point at \(z\)=1.3m, allowing for thermal contraction at \(z\)=0. This arrangement was chosen to simplify the service connections at the barrel end. However, we do now believe that stresses in the services due to the thermal dimensional changes of the staves can be managed easily and we are now considering an anchor point at \(z\)=0. In the following we will present designs for both cases. In either case the stave fixations at \(z\)=0 do not contribute to the width of the central gap. This width is solely driven by the separation between the +z and -z staves, which in the case of the \(z\)=1.3m anchoring needs to be large enough to allow for differential thermal contraction between staves and support structure.

At present, the design calls for five intermediate locking points for each stave, but this number is not finalized. Optimization of this number will closely tie into the design of support cylinders and stave cores. Fixation pins guided in slotted holes at the stave ends on the outer edge constrain the rotation of the stave around the fixed edge.

The locking points and all other fixation elements are injection moulded parts (currently envisaged is the use of Liquid Crystal Polymer, LCP) and as such a part dimensional tolerance of \(\pm\)25um is achievable.

An overview of the components is given in Figure 4.

Figure 4: Overview of the edge-mounting components. \(z\)=0 fixations are shared by adjacent staves and two z=0 fixations support the two edges of every stave.

### Intermediate locking points

The intermediate locking points consist of two components (Figure 5); the mounting bracket, which is glued onto the support cylinder, and the lock, which is glued to the stave. The latter consists of three parts:

* The lock core which features a cam housing, a pair of reference faces and an extended piece which allows the lock core to be glued into the C-channel of the stave;
* A cam which provides the locking and unlocking of the stave core to the bracket;
* A cam restraining pin holds the cam inside the cam housing of the lock core after it is assembled into the lock core.

The mounting bracket is a single part, which features the matching pair of reference faces, the lock housing, a pair of dimples to hold the cam in a positive locked position, a number of tooling holes and a base for the glue joint to the cylinder surface.

When the mechanism is locked the stave is wedged against a pair of reference faces (Figure 6). This guarantees the azimuth and radial positions, but allows some differential thermal movement between the stave and the cylinder in the \(z\)-direction. When it is in the locked position, the tongue in the bracket is pressed against the groove in the lock core which forms a stable and rigid structure. It is this design feature that provides a known and repeatable reference datum for the stave mounting.

During insertion the cam is in its retracted position leaving sufficient gaps for the insertion of the stave. Once in position, the cam is rotated to the locked position. This is carried out by a long hex key through the hexagonal nut through-hole. The centres of the hexagon nuts of all intermediate locking points line up, so that the hex key is guided by the holes of the outer locking points during its insertion and when the inner locking points are locked one after the other. Dimples at either side of

Figure 6: Positioning by the use of reference faces.

the cam are provided on the bracket to stop the cam from spontaneously springing back to the retracted position. The torque required for the locking/unlocking procedure is typically about 0.5Nm.

A number of tooling holes are provided in the bracket, which allow the temporary placement of tooling, such as guide rails and restraint rods, during the insertion and removal of the staves. For a discussion of the insertion tooling see section 6.

The critical dimensions on the locking points are those that provide the necessary clearance between adjacent staves. At 10\({}^{\circ}\) tilt angle, and assuming conservative overlap requirements, the existing design provides sufficient clearance between staves.

The extension piece on the lock core which is glued to the C-channel of the stave must have sufficient rigidity to limit any rotational displacement of the stave when it is mounted. The primary function of the C-channel close-outs is to provide a complete enclosure for the sandwich materials, add shear strength to the stave sandwich and to provide local rigidity at the edges for mounting of modules and other components. Although not part of the locking mechanism design the C-channels are critical to the rotational rigidity of the mounted stave in the proposed edge-mounting scheme.

The components on the stave are identical for all staves, with barrel-to-barrel variations accommodated in the mounting brackets. Thus the only differentiation between the staves introduced by the locking mechanics is between positive and negative z, due to the asymmetry of the locking mechanics with respect to the central stave plane.

### Central support

At the z=0 position the stave is supported by the central support bracket. Two different schemes for this support have been developed, depending on the z-anchoring scheme.

If the stave is anchored at z=1.3m this bracket has two pairs of positional pins, shared by the +z and -z staves. The two pins on each z-side provide support two adjacent staves (Figure 7). The central support bracket is glued to the cylinder at the same time as the row of locking brackets using the same gluing ruler. The central support bracket does not introduce material between the +z and -z staves, so that the gap between these staves is only driven by the requirement to allow for thermal expansion of these staves.

Figure 7: Central supports for anchoring at z=1.3m. Note that the end locking support is glued into the side close-out away from the end of the stave, so that no gap is introduced between the staves by the support mechanics.

The components on the stave connecting to these two pins are the end locking and the mid-end supports. Both have a hole with a contour profile to guide the pin into its final position even if the stave is slightly misaligned during insertion. The hole in the end locking support is round, while the mid-end support is slotted to allow for transverse thermal expansion of the stave.

In the case the staves are anchored at z=0 the central support features a tooling ball, which mates with a conical section on the stave (Figure 8). The centre of this ball-in-cone arrangement is in line with the intermediate locking points, and is secured by a captive screw, which can be locked by the same long hex key as the intermediate locking points. As the central support bracket, which includes the spherical ball, is fixed to the cylinder, the ball provides a convenient feature to survey the anchor points on each cylinder.

### End locking point

If the stave is anchored at z=1.3m a mounting bracket is provided to anchor the stave position in all three directions at this end (Figure 9). Note that in order to allow the stave to clear the anchor point at z=1.3m this anchor point has to be offset to the side of the axis through the locking points.

Figure 8: Central supports for anchoring at z=0.

Figure 10: End view of end anchor point. Note the offset between the locking point axis and the end locking point.

Figure 9: End anchor point.

A rotational constraint for the stave is again given by a pin in a slot at the outer edge of the stave. The exact design of the support for this pin will depend on the design of the end flanges of the support cylinders and the interlinks. Potentially, this support could cover the insertion clearance for the adjacent stave. If this is the case, then there would be a preferred order of insertion, with staves being tiled on top of each other. For the insertion of the last stave a temporary support for the other adjacent stave would be needed. However, we are optimistic that we can avoid this constraint by proper design of the interlinks and cylinder end flanges.

### _FE analysis of edge-mounting scheme_

To demonstrate the rigidity offered by the edge mounting scheme, we have conducted an FE analysis of a stave with a realistic geometry (length 1.2m), a stave mass of 1.2kg (representing the mass including detector modules), and with five intermediate locking points and realistic end constraints to study the deflections of the stave under its gravity load.

The stave was modelled as a 5mm thick solid Aluminium plate with cut-outs, which were chosen so that the stave mass is similar to the mass of a CF composite stave including the weight of the detector modules. Similar dummy staves have been made and used for the insertion trials described later in this note (section 8.4). We have measured the bending stiffness of these Aluminium staves and compared it to the bending stiffness of CF composite stave prototypes (no modules) of the design planned for the upgrade tracker (K13C2U/EX1515, fibre areal weight 45gsm, skin layup 0/90/0). We found that the bending stiffness of the Aluminium stave is smaller by about 29% (39.58\(\pm\)0.36 Nm\({}^{2}\), compared to 55.67\(\pm\)0.82 Nm\({}^{2}\)). The material properties used in the FEA are listed in Table 1.

The boundary conditions for the FEA model reflect the edge mounting condition of the stave which is anchored at \(z\)=1.2m end. The details are as below:

* The bottom faces of the locking brackets were fully fixed as they are supposed to be glued to the cylinder;
* At the \(z\)=1.2m end, the inner corner point was fully fixed, and the outer corner point was constraint longitudinally and vertically but free transversely;
* At the \(z\)=0 end, the inner corner point was free only in longitudinal direction, and the outer corner point was allowed to move in both directions, longitudinally and transversely.

Two cases have been studied: For the first the contact faces between the locking brackets and locking points were bonded; for the second the contact faces between the two were frictionless, i.e. free sliding. The FEA result shows that the maximum deflection of the stave, which is mainly along the unsupported edge, is 82um when the contact faces were bonded and 120um when the contact faces were in frictionless contact (Figure 11). For a CF composite stave this deflection is likely to be smaller for its higher inherent stiffness.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{l c c c}  & Density (\(\frac{1}{2}\)/ml) & Home-2 Machine (ME) & Research ratio \\ \hline \(\mathrm{LCP}\) (for locking points) & 1500 & 12000 & 0.25 \\ Aluminium (for dummy stave) & 2700 & 70000 & 0.28 \\ Dummy modules (Nylon) & **1130** & 2827 & 0.3 \\ \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 1: Material properties used in the FEA.

### _Mounting of locking components_

The jig to mount the lock cores onto the staves for large scale production is still to be designed. The approach will be to use a standard jig on which all five brackets are accurately mounted so that it provides a reliable datum to mount the lock cores to which the stave is glued. On current prototypes we used an existing set of locking brackets to locate the lock cores during the gluing to the stave.

The intermediate mounting brackets and the \(z\)=0 fixation brackets are glued onto the support cylinders using a jig which accurately positions the brackets during the cure by constraining the brackets by precision steel rods through the guide rail insertion holes. On the final support cylinders this ruler will be positioned using precision features on the endflanges.

Figure 11: FEA of Aluminium stave deflection under self-weight (1.2kg) for frictionless contact at the locking points. The maximum deflection along the unsupported edge is 0.12mm. Note that the stiffness of this stave is 29% lower than for a CF stave.

Structural interaction between stave and support cylinder

We have studied the effects of the locking points on structural behaviour of the stave and cylinder using FEA. The aim of this study was to understand

* the behaviour of the staves on the support structure,
* the stave contribution to the stiffness of the support cylinder, and
* the dependence of the stave deformation on the cylinder stiffness.

Results of this study will allow us to optimize the stave mounting mechanics and the cylinder design and to understand how the locking point design affects the cylinder - stave interaction.

### _The FEA model_

A single cylinder FEA model was built based on the strawman layout 07v14. A cylinder model with an OD of 708mm and a length of 2.5m is used throughout the study. There are 56 staves on the cylinder.

The cylinder was modelled as a single skin with flanges at either end. The ends were attached to a flexible annulus (Figure 13) that provides a translation constraint with minimal rotational constraint. The model simplified the on-cylinder brackets to cuboids, the stave to a cuboid and the stave end points to sliding pins.

The boundary conditions of the model are listed in the following:

* All the mounting brackets are bonded to the cylinder.
* All staves are fixed in the \(z\)=0 position, but allowed to slide without friction in the \(z\) direction at all the mount points along the length.
* The \(z\)=1.2m stave end is simply supported (sliding) on pins.
* The stave weight is 1kg.
* The cylinder is initially modelled with a solid carbon fibre plate with an effective \(E\) value of 60GPa (future studies may consider sandwich plate properties).

This study was originally carried out on two contact conditions between the locking core and the locking bracket: fully bonded and free sliding.

The material input parameters used in the FEA are listed in Table 2. The Young's modulus value of 60GPa is a conservative choice justified by results from 3-point bend test of completed stave

Figure 13: FEA model for the study of the effects of the locking points on the structural behaviour of the support structures.

prototypes made of UHM CF (K13C2U). For the mounting brackets an artificially high \(E\) value was used to eliminate any effect a bracket deformation might have on their structural behaviour as this exercise concentrates only on the understanding of the interactive behaviour of the stave and the cylinder. This effect will need to be included at a later stage, when the exact properties of the mounting brackets are defined.

### Deflection of the cylinder under various interface conditions

Three models were studied: one with distributed mass, one with free sliding staves and one with fully locked staves. If the staves are allowed to slide freely at the locking points (a condition caused by locks being loosened), the cylinder deflection is almost identical to a cylinder with no staves attached, but with their mass distributed along its length. The cylinder deflection is reduced by more than half when the staves are bonded to the locking points (Figure 15).

Figure 14: Deformations of the support cylinder under different interface conditions.

Figure 15: Deflection at the top along the length of a cylinder fully loaded with staves with free and fully bonded lock points.

### _Deflection of the stave under various interface conditions_

The staves are not completely encapsulated so they deform under static loads. The stave deformation was found to be dependent upon the stave connection to the cylinder (Figure 16). A free sliding connection between the lock parts will cause the stave to deflect three times more than when it is 'bonded' to the locking points.

From the two studies above (sections 5.2 and 5.3) it can be seen that:

* When staves are fully bonded to the cylinder via the lock points, the stiffness contribution to the cylinder is significant.
* When the staves are allowed to slide freely along the cylinder length with one end fixed, the stiffness contribution to the cylinder is negligible. The deflection is comparable to the deflection of a cylinder with no stave attached to it.
* The stave sags under gravity are dramatically different depending on the stave/cylinder connection.

### _Model including variable friction_

These observations indicate that the friction in the connection between stave and cylinder is a very important parameter to understand. To achieve this the model was modified to include variable friction between the lock points. At the same time a pull test was performed to establish the real coefficients of friction between the parts (see section 12), which is then be used as input to the FEA.

The single cylinder model detailed above was modified to introduce representative contact areas for which a coefficient of friction could be set. This model has been used to study the dependence of the deformations on various interaction conditions between stave and cylinder using Static Analysis and Modal Analysis. The cylinder in this model is 1mm thick. The results are shown in Figure 17.

Figure 16: FEA plots of the deflection profile of the stave along its free edge at the 12 o’clock position.

Figure 17: Dependence of the cylinder deformation on the friction between the locking components.

When the stave locking parts are fully bonded to the mounting brackets, the maximum cylinder deflection is 11.7um. The results in Figure 17 suggest that even when there is a coefficient of friction of \(\mu\)=1 the connection is still not as rigid as the fully bonded condition. However, we do obtain a significant stiffening of the system when the coefficient of friction increases from 0 to about 0.5.

This behaviour can be understood from Figure 18. When \(\mu\)=0, the stave can slide freely along the joints, offering no resistance to the deflection of the cylinder. When \(\mu\) increases above 0, there develops frictional force acting along the longitudinal direction of the stave, resisting sliding at the joint. As long as the ratio of \(\delta\)x/\(\delta\)y remains small, sliding will continue, albeit reduced with the increase in the \(\delta\)x/\(\delta\)y ratio. When the ratio of \(\delta\)x/\(\delta\)y becomes significant, the sliding joint becomes locked and no further sliding is possible. In our FEA this happens when \(\mu\)=0.5. \(\delta\)x remains the same on further increase of \(\mu\). Deflection of the cylinder remains almost constant at 16.5um when \(\mu\)>0.5. If however the joints are assumed bonded in the first place, \(\delta\)x would be kept at zero throughout. This reduces the cylinder deflection to 11.7um, quite a bit lower even than for the case of \(\mu\)=1.

### Modal analysis at various interface conditions between stave and cylinder

As the stave has comparable cross-section to the cylinder it is reasonable to assume that any motions of the stave relative to the cylinder will cause considerable distortion on one or the other. The specific concern is that as the thermally expanding stave is only constrained to the cylinder at each locking point these motions could result in local distortions of both the stave and the cylinder.

Figure 19 shows the distortion of the cylinder skin in the FEA. It can be seen that the cylinder skin puckers around the locking points. The amount of puckering will depend on the friction between the two halves of the lock point, clearly a free sliding case will cause the least distortion of the cylinder, but it will also allow the staves to contribute minimally to the stiffness to the overall system. The optimal balance between these effects is yet to be determined.

Insertion tooling and stave frame

We have developed tooling for the construction of the sector prototype which we consider representative for the final assembly tooling, although the final designs will need to be adapted to the specific dimensions and fiducials of the final cylinder designs.

### Guide rails

The guide rails provide a smooth and continuous passage of the lock cores during the insertion of the stave from one end to the other end of the cylinder. The guide rails are supported by the guide rail support holes in the brackets. They are slid into these holes, and then rotated so that they, together with the locking brackets, form a continuous rail for the insertion of the staves (Figure 20). During the insertion the guide rails are extended on the outside of the barrel first by a short transition piece and then by rails with a similar profile, which are part of the stave frame. The stave is therefore constrained throughout the insertion at all the mount points over its full length including the mount point at the leading edge (z=0) of the stave.

The profile of the guide rails matches the tongue-in-groove profile of the locking points. Clearances in the profile have been chosen to allow for easy insertion, while constraining the stave to prevent interferences during insertion. Neither during rail insertion, nor during the rotation or the insertion of the stave do the guide rails interfere with adjacent staves, so that they can be used for the insertion or the removal of a stave in a fully populated barrel.

The rails consist of 8mm diameter stainless steel rods with an approximate length of 1300mm, and five sets of rail shoes (Figure 21), which fit between the locking brackets. The shoes will be made from aluminium, with 8mm holes wire-eroded over the full length of each shoe. Each shoe is approximately 200mm long, the spacing between consecutive locking points. The spacing between shoes is a little over the length of the locking brackets (1mm) to allow the guide rail to be rotated into position once it is fully inserted through the pre-assigned guide rail hole in the locking bracket.

To prove the design principle and to save time in prototyping, we produced a set of prototype guide rails with shoes made of nylon using rapid prototyping (3-D printing). This was used in the prototype studies described throughout this document.

Figure 20: Guide rail rotation. Note that the geometry in this figure is aggressively constrained (staves are tilted by 10\({}^{\circ}\). red squares indicate 15mm clearances for stave envelope, stave separation is given by the requirements outlined in section 3) to give a worst case scenario.

### Guide rail restraint rods

Once inserted and rotated into position to guide the stave the guide rails get secured by the guide rail restraint rods. These are 4mm diameter stainless steel rods about 1300mm long. They are inserted into the guide rail restraint holes in the locking brackets.

### Stave frame

The stave frame, while in fact not a part of the locking mechanics, plays an important role in the insertion of staves into the barrel. Therefore, we are introducing here our current ideas for the design of this component. In this concept it has been designed to fulfil three roles:

1. It will be used for stave assembly, allowing the precise mounting and wire-bonding of the Silicon Detectors.
2. It is used as a transport frame.
3. It will be used during the insertion of the staves.

In this report we will focus on the transport and installation features.

Figure 21: Guide rails.

Figure 22: Hole patterns in locking brackets for guide rail and their restraint rods.

### Initial mounting of stave into frame

The stave is mounted into the stave frame and supported by rotating paddles (Figure 23). On the locking mechanism side these are of fixed length to provide a datum, on the opposite side they are spring loaded to take up any small variations in stave geometry. The paddles locate into the C-channels providing accurate support for the stave during wafer mounting, wire bonding, transport and installation. The stave is positioned axially by a ball which locates on the \(z\)=0 feature and plastic screws to take up any clearance.

Our current design of the stave frame consists of sections to facilitate manufacture. These sections overlap each other in a similar way to brickwork. In this way we feel we can guarantee accuracy, rather than attempting to manufacture from one piece of material. We are also investigating using extruded sections for the sides of the frame, once the concept is proven.

#### 6.4.1 Transport

For transport covers are mounted on top and bottom, and the plastic screws are adjusted at each end to constrain any axial movement. A further end plate is added to provide a seal around the cooling tubes.

#### 6.4.2 Installation preparation

For insertion the temporary interlink plate on the barrel is removed and the locking brackets are prepared for stave insertion by fitting the guide rails (see section 6.1).

The end plate of the stave frame is made of two parts, a bridge and infill (Figure 24). The infill section is removed leaving the bridge which mounts to the installation interlink plate (Figure 25). The assembly is re-mounted to the barrel end flanges. Other supports for the stave frame still need to be designed to support the stave frame from the Outer Cylinder (OC) or other structures at the far end. In this way the stave frame will be attached and aligned to the barrel support structure.

Figure 23: Stave supported by paddles in the stave frame (top sections of frame not shown for clarity).

### Installation

To install the stave the support paddles must be rotated through 90deg to move them out of the C-channels. The stave is now supported by the locking cores in their channel. The spring loaded paddles when rotated out of the C-channel have a tenon on their sides. This forms a support rail to support the C-channel of the End-Of-Steve (EOS) card stave core extension. The sprung paddles can be rotated sequentially during the stave insertion to provide good support all along during the insertion. The stave is then pushed forward onto the guide rails and slid into the barrel. When the stave is fully inserted the stave frame is removed, the locking mechanisms are closed and the guide rails are removed.

Insertion sequence

At the beginning of the insertion sequence the stave sits in the insertion frame. The steps in the stave insertion sequence for the case of the \(z\)=1.3m anchor point are:

1. Adjust the frame mount to the pre-defined angular position;
2. Insert one guide rail into the barrel and then rotate it to the designated position;
3. Insert the restraint rod, so that the guide rail's rotation is locked;
4. Insert the other guide rail into the barrel and then rotate it to the designated position;
5. Insert the restraint rod, so that the second guide rail's rotation is locked;
6. Insert the transition piece to the end of barrel, just before the first locking point;
7. Place and slide the stave frame into the frame mount;
8. Remove the front protection plate from stave frame;
9. Slide the stave frame slowly forward until the interface plate, which is at the front of the frame, touches the flanges of the barrel;
10. The flange has a pair of dowel holes and one M5 screw hole that match with similar features on an interface plate on the stave frame. Insert the dowel pins in position and tighten the screw, so that the stave insertion frame is docked to the barrel end and the stave is ready for insertion;
11. Insert the stave by gently pushing the end of stave, until the cone part on the stave at \(z\)=1.3m meets the ball part which is glued on the barrel (during the real installation staves could be pushed by torque-limited motors);
12. Fix the cone to ball by tightening the screw so that one corner of the stave at z=1.3m is constrained;
13. Separate the interface plate from the stave frame and remove the stave frame;
14. Place the end support plate which has a slotted hole to support the pin at the outer edge of stave;
15. Insert the hex key rod through the hexagon shaped holes in the locking points. The positions the rod has to have to engage each of the locking points is marked on the rod;
16. Rotate the hex key rod clockwise to operate the locking. Lock the last locking point, which is close to the \(z\)=0 end, first. Repeat one by one to lock the other locking points;
17. Remove the long hex key rod after all the locking points are locked;
18. Remove the transition pieces;
19. Remove the restraint rods;
20. Remove the guide rails;
21. Change the frame mount to the next angular position;

Repeat the procedures to insert the next stave. Note that details of this sequence might change as the insertion sequence and infrastructure in the final environment within the OC will be refined.

Prototypes

As part of our development two prototypes were built to help understand how the insertion works: a trial insertion jig that allows the mounting of one stave which was used to optimize the insertion tooling, and a prototype of one sector of the inner cylinder which allows three staves to be mounted. The size of the prototype sector was chosen to allow the study of the insertion and the removal of a stave between two adjacent ones.

All the necessary tools and jigs have been developed to test the principle of the proposed end-insertion methodology. Although some of the parts of the tooling were made in Nylon using 3-D printing to save time, they can be replaced with the metal parts once the proposed design principle is verified.

### _Sector prototype_

The sector prototype is made of a curved skin of carbon fibre (80gsm K13D2U/RS-3,skin layup 0/90/0/90/0/90/0/90/0/90/0, total thickness of 0.7mm) with a curvature corresponding to the innermost support barrel (R363mm). The skin is reinforced by three stiffeners underneath along its length and mounted in an aluminium frame (Figure 28). The sector prototype can accommodate three staves. It was built to further develop the insertion tooling and to understand any potential problems during insertion in a realistic geometry. Furthermore, it was used to study the insertion and removal of a stave between two adjacent staves and in different orientations.

The sector support frame and the mount points on the sector itself were designed so that one stave is parallel to the base plate. This facilitates CMM survey and cross-referencing to the base plate datum.

The three rows of support brackets were glued onto the prototype sector using a straight jig which positions each locking point during the cure. The results of a CMM survey of the locking bracket positions after gluing to the sector prototype are shown in Figure 29.

Figure 28: Sector prototype.

In summary the results are:

* Horizontal parallelism: This is defined by the gradients for the three rows in the horizontal direction. The gradients of linear fits to the three rows of brackets in this direction are 0.1mm/m, 0.3mm/m and 0.4mm/m, respectively. The maximum deviation between these gradients is therefore 0.3mrad.
* The maximum horizontal deviation from the best linear fit is 77um for any bracket.
* Vertical parallelism: The gradients of linear fits to the three rows of brackets in this direction are -0.1mm/m, 0.1mm/m and -0.2mm/m, respectively. The parallelism in this direction is therefore also 0.3mrad.
* The maximum vertical deviation from the best linear fit is 58um for any bracket.

### End support bracket

The end support brackets were glued at the same time as the brackets using the same jig. After mounting the positions of the support pin for the stave end were surveyed in the vertical direction using a CMM. The vertical positions agreed with the nominal positions within up to 160um (Table 3).

### Front end support plate

The stave position at the _z_=1.3m end is fixed by two support points. It provides a fixed support (full constraint) to the stave on the inner edge and a simple support on the outer edge. The latter is provided for the tests described in this report by a bracket which is mounted on the end flange. The support points and the brackets are shown in Figure 30. For the final design the _z_=1.3m support points will be incorporated in the design of the barrel interlinks, which is still under study.

The support brackets were aligned using the CMM to adjust this stave corner until it was in-plane with the other mount points.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{c|c|c|c} \hline  & Dominant (b) & Restricted (c) & Difference (m) \\ \hline

Figure 29: Survey of brackets on the sector prototype. The graphs show the position of the brackets in \(x\) (parallel to table) and \(z\) (height above the table) as a function of the position along the sector.

### _Stave prototypes and gluing of lock cores_

The prototype staves used for the insertion trials on the sector prototype are aluminium staves with the same outer dimensions as real CF planks (incl. C-channels), but with cut-outs to make the weight similar. Onto these prototype staves rapid-prototyped models of the Silicon modules were stuck with double sided adhesive tape.

The brackets on the sector prototype were then used as a jig to position the lock cores onto the prototype staves used for the insertion trials. For this height gauges (three along the length) were used to support the free edge of the stave in the horizontal orientation while the other side was supported by the lock cores which were in turn locked into the brackets (Figure 31). This arrangement, together with the end supports, provided an accurate positioning for the stave plane since each height gauge could be adjusted with an accuracy of 10m. The position in the plane is less critical and was obtained by pushing the stave against the lock cores.

During the final assembly the gluing of lock cores will be part of the stave assembly and dedicated jigs are developed for this operation.

Figure 31: Gluing of lock cores onto prototype staves.

Figure 30: Front end support brackets.

### Insertion frame

Two insertion frames have been built for the studies described here. The first insertion frame (Figure 32) consisted of a main frame made from Bosch profile Aluminium channels with 3D-printed profile channels (in blue and in green in the figure) as a guide for the lock cores during insertion.

The experience acquired with this first frame allowed us to develop a second frame which has additional features required to connect to the sector prototype like the interface plate at the front end (Figure 33). The transition piece between the frame and the sector prototype was made using 3D printing (Figure 34).

Figure 34: Guide ralls with transition piece.

Figure 32: First prototype insertion frame (on the left) shown connected to insertion trial jig during the insertion of a stave (in green).

### Frame mount

The frame mount is a support structure that provides the interface between the global strip support structure and the stave insertion frame. It allows the insertion frame to be aligned to the required insertion angle of the stave and to provide a support for the transition. Figure 35 shows the design of the simple frame mount used for the studies described in this document. It has the following features:

* Capability to insert stave at different angular position without having to dismount the frame mount;
* Pin holes allow insertion frames to be locked to required positions and to align with the correct stave positions;
* The stave frame can be slid in and out once it is mounted in the frame mount to dock to the support structure. Provision is made to ensure that the stave frame is fixed securely for its sliding operation at different angular positions.

### Insertion in different orientations

In order to study the insertion in different orientations, a frame of aluminium profiles has been made which supports both, the sector prototype and the insertion frame (Figure 41). The insertion position can be changed by turning the frame from one side to the next. It therefore allows the study of stave end insertion in four different orientations. Figure 42 shows an insertion run in the 3'oclock position.

Figure 44: Displacements from straight line for the leading free corner during insertion of the stave for different orientations. The plot shows local minimum and maximum values from three consecutive insertions. The traces are recorded during insertion from the z=1.2 end towards the z=0 end. The horizontal axis is the z-position of the measurement, and the vertical axis shows displacement away from the support barrel. All curves are adjusted so that they end at zero displacement at the end of the insertion (z=0).

Figure 45: Displacements of the stave (including pencil) corresponding to a -1.5 (yellow)/+4mm (red) displacement at the tip of the pencil as described in the text (the stave in the nominal position is green). It is assumed that the stave rotates in the locking point. The module outline shown includes space for the wire bonds for the 10 readout ASICs across the width of a hybrid, with a thickness of 10.66mm (no additional powering elements are shown). The tilt angle for this figure is 10\({}^{\circ}\).

### Movements during locking

During locking, the relative movement between the cam and the housing will result in a movement of the stave. We have studied this movement to understand its impact on the stave clearances.

#### 9.4.1 Standalone movement of locking point

We measured the movements of the lock core extension of a standalone locking point during the locking operation using dial gauges (resolution 0.01mm). Before locking, the cam is in its retracted position, and the dial gauges are set to zero. During the locking the cam inside the locking core is rotated in the clockwise direction using a hex key, and measurements are taken as the cam rotates.

Locking is complete when the cam has passed through the dimple in the bracket.

Horizontally the lock core moves by 0.45mm during the locking, and returns to the original position when it is complete. Vertically the movements are smaller, but the lock core ends up higher by 0.08mm.

#### 9.4.2 Movement of stave during the locking of single lock

We also measured the displacement of the free edge of a stave during the locking. This measurement was performed on a stave in the horizontal position on the sector prototype during locking of the middle locking point with dial indicators tracking the horizontal and vertical movement of the free edge at the same longitudinal position on the stave. Because the movements of the indicators are too fast to be tracked by eye we recorded the indicator displays by video (30fps) and analysed the displacement offline frame by frame. The result is consistent with the measurement described in the previous section. The vertical movement is small (<0.1mm). Figure 47 shows the horizontal movement of the free edge during the locking and unlocking operation.

Figure 46: Measurement of standalone movement of locking point.

Figure 47: Horizontal displacement of the unsupported edge during locking of the locking point at the same longitudinal position. Overshoots are caused by bouncing of the dial indicator.

#### 9.4.3 Movement of stave during complete locking sequence

This measurement was repeated with a complete stave on the sector prototype, with five pairs of dial gauges measuring the vertical and horizontal movements of the free edge at the longitudinal locations of the intermediate locking points (Figure 48). Measurements were taken during the complete sequence of locking after each lock has been engaged as the locking progresses from the first to the last locking point. The two ends of the stave (_z_=0 and _z_=1.2m) were supported in their respective fixations, as they would be in the final insertion. The 1.3m long hex key is used to operate the locking mechanisms and to lock them one by one from the _z_=0 end outwards, guided along its length by the outer locking points.

The results of these measurements for different orientations of the sector prototype are summarized in Figure 49. The dial gauges have been zeroed for the unlocked stave, which is deformed by gravitational sag. This gets reduced as the progressive locking pulls the free edge straight.

For comparison we also measured the free-edge displacements for a different locking sequence: Starting with the 1\({}^{\mathrm{st}}\) lock (closest to _z_=0), followed by the 5\({}^{\mathrm{th}}\) lock (closest to _z_=1.2m), and then the 2\({}^{\mathrm{nd}}\), 4\({}^{\mathrm{th}}\), and finally the 3\({}^{\mathrm{rd}}\) (middle) lock (Figure 50).

The maximum horizontal and vertical movements of the free edge are typically close to the middle of the stave and are up to 0.2mm. The tolerance band on the measuring gauges is around 50um.

Figure 49: Displacements along the free edge after the locking of each lock along the stave for different orientations of the sector prototype. The first locking point in the sequence is the one closest to \(z\)=0, the last the one closest to \(z\)=1.2m. The coordinate system for the measurements (horizontal/vertical) is in lab coordinates. The gauges are set to zero for the unlocked stave.

## 10 Mode shapes

To understand how the single-edge-mounted stave behaves when excited by an external load a measurement of the normal modes of the structure was carried out. If the modal behaviour is as predicted by FEA, this should indicate the locks are functioning properly when they are in the locked position. This provides a cross-check to the integrity of the locks.

During the test, the stave was vertically mounted on an Invar panel (Figure 51). It is mounted with four intermediate locking points and four end supports. Three different frequency measurement methods were used and checked to be consistent. The first two relied on accelerometers attached to the stave. The excitation was applied either by tapping the structure and recording an FFT of the resulting vibration, or by a single frequency sine sound wave excitation of the whole structure and a recording of the amplitude of the consequent vibration as a function of frequency. The third method to locate the normal modes was via use of Electronic Speckle Pattern Interferometry (ESPI) which is a standard technique used to measure not just modal frequencies, but also the shape of the vibrations.

The ESPI method is not described in detail here, see for example ref. [4]. The system used a 300mW green laser with long coherence length and was used in an out-of-plane configuration. Excitation was accomplished using sound broadcast at the whole structure. The resulting images may be crudely thought of as contour maps of the surface with the lines representing the size of the out-of-plane vibration. The separation in vertical amplitude between lines is not constant (as it would be on a contour map), but described by a Bessel function. The principal value of this technique is that it allows direct comparison of the structure's behaviour with the FEA prediction in a much more comprehensive manner than simply measuring the mode frequencies. A summary of the results for the observed mode frequencies is shown in Figure 51.

Not all modes were visible with each method. This is to be expected as the ability to excite a mode is dependent on the details of the excitation method.

Figure 52 shows an example of a particularly clear ESPI mode. It should be noted that with an object of this size, and the non-spherical optics employed, the technique is not straightforward. A vibration with a maximum amplitude of about 5\(\mu\)m is shown (the magnitude is depending on the strength of the excitation).

Figure 51: Mounting arrangement (left); Table of mode frequency measurements (right).

In Figure 53 below the results of the ESPI studies are compared with the FEA predictions identified as the corresponding modes for the first three modes. The mode shapes and frequencies matched well with our previous FEA studies. It should be noted that the model parameters are adjusted to make the first mode frequency match.

The conclusion from this work is that when the structure is driven by an external force, the structure and its locking points behave in a manner which matches our predictions.

## 11 Deformation measurements

One of the primary requirements on the structure is that it supports the detector elements in a location which is stable to a precision of a few microns in normal operation for extended periods (weeks). It is acceptable for the structure to move and to change shape during a temperature excursion provided that it always returns to the same position and shape within a few microns. It should also not move to an extent which would risk clashes between structures.

To study this behaviour we have measured the stave deformation both using ESPI and using a capacitive sensor system.

The measurements are not easy, particularly for long-term stability, because most large structures move at the level of a few microns due to normal temperature and humidity variations. Below the results are described first, then an explanation is given of the test system used to explore the stave and locking point stability, followed by some details of the data from the studies. For the sake of brevity, only a subset of the data taken is presented.

### 11.1 Summary of Results

The stave was repeatedly cooled down from room temperature to -25C. The maximum out-of-plane deformation was found to be about 100m at the outer free edge of the stave. After several weeks of stabilisation the movement during a rapid cooling was found to be consistent from one cool-down to the next to within about 3m. However, when warmed back up it did not return to exactly the same place even after all identified long-term effects had been removed. The difference in starting to return position was less than about 8m. This is probably acceptable for an out-of-plane motion. At the centre of the stave, the motion was largely a rotation about the point where the mounting bracket jointed the stave core (not about the axis of the locking point joint to the main structure). However at the ends of the stave there are additional locking points and away from the centre the motion is more complex.

The stave was found to be immune to changes in the pressure of the cooling pipes. The most extreme motion observed was less than 1m in response to a pressure change from 1 to 18bar.

The stave was, however, found to be susceptible to very small vibrations from external sources which could result in non-reversible shifts at the level of 10m. The decoupling of the cooling pipes from the external cooling plant was also found to be inadequate; disturbances at the end of 5m long flexible cooling pipes, which were multiply decoupled from the stave, could result in significant motion in the stave (about 10-15m). These were sometimes reversible by reversing the external disturbance.

The stave deformations were observed over an extended period whilst it was kept in a dry environment (<1\({}^{+2}_{-1}\)% RH at room temperature). It was found that the stave exhibited a long-term drift (characterised by a drift of 1.5m/week at the free edge) with a time constant of several weeks. By assumption, this was associated with the structure drying.

The overall conclusions are that the mounting brackets are close to adequate, but that further work is needed to understand and remove the influence of external sources of force which could drivemotion. A degree of hysteresis is observed under cooling and warming, but this is probably already close to an acceptable level.

### Measurement System

In order to make micron scale measurements of motion, a stable reference plate is needed with respect to which the measurements are made. This is particularly difficult to achieve for long-term measurements. The stave was mounted in a thermally insulated chamber. The back-plate of the chamber was a massive 50mm aluminium slab, manufactured from tooling plate, mounted vertically, external to the thermally isolated region. Stainless steel hollow pillars connected this massive plate to a secondary datum plate mounted inside the thermal volume. The secondary plate was mounted kinematically to the external plate, which was therefore capable of exerting only small forces on the internal datum plate. The internal plate was constructed entirely of Invar sheet. It is a sandwich structure with two skins separated by a square cell Invar "honeycomb" used to separate the skins. The structure was glued to ensure no stresses were introduced during manufacture. The surface of the Invar skins were covered with ten independent heater panels, each of which is controlled by a microprocessor and maintains the skin temperature at a constant value to within 0.5\({}^{\circ}\)C. Layers of thermal insulation isolate the plate and heaters from the cooled test structure. The datum plate is thus a kinematically mounted, rigid structure fabricated from a very low CTE metallic alloy which is stress-free and temperature-stabilised. It is believed, but not measured, that this base plate is stable.

The Invar baseplate has the locking points glued to it and the stave is mounted in a vertical orientation on these. The arrangement is shown in Figure 54.

The thermal box consists of 70mm thick foam on all sides except the front face. As it was intended to image the stave with an ESPI system (see section 10), the front wall is constructed of triple layer glass. This glass wall was also in place for the measurements discussed here. The chamber is supplied with dried air, which maintains a relative humidity reported at 0.35% relative humidity at room temperature by multiple sensors (the sensor accuracy is \(\pm\)2%). The temperature in the chamber is not controlled but is quite stable as long as the room in which it is located is not accessed. The room itself is thermally isolated and its internal temperature can be raised by several degrees by a 100W heater. The chamber is mounted on a large optical table. However, for most measurements the table is not floated, but is resting on rubber feet. Floating was not found to alter measurements.

Figure 54: Mounting arrangement for deflection tests.

Mounted from the Invar plate, across the stave, was a bridge manufactured from Invar legs and aluminium angle. A set of five capacitive distance sensors were mounted to the bridge. The sensors provide an accurate measurement of the distance to a surface accurate to better than a micron. The bridge could be mounted at several locations along the length of the stave, allowing a map of the motions to be built up. This system was selected due to the long-term stability of the sensors and their immunity to a range of environmental factors. Several tests were done to confirm the manufacturer's specifications, but these will not be discussed here in detail.

Figure 55 and Figure 56 show the arrangement and a map of the locations observed.

The positions, temperatures and humidity levels are recorded continuously at 6 second intervals. Data is averaged off-line over a hundred or more data points except when there is an active event where the full resolution may be kept. This results in a very stable measurement system, with sub-micron resolution.

### Measurements

The motion of the structure in response to cooling down to -25degC is shown in Figure 57. This is reproducible. The stave is constrained at four points at the ends and at four additional points along the edge with the locking points, but free along the long edge away from the locking points, resulting in a complex shape. However the maximum motion is observed at the centre of the free edge away from the side to which the locking points are attached, where the motion of the stave across its width is very close to a rotation about the point where the locking point joins the edge of the stave. This central location was selected for observation during a more extended series of measurements.

Figure 57: Bowed shape of the stave after cooling. The central region rotates. The end constraints are different resulting in a complex overall motion. Vertical scale in \(\mu\)m, the others in mm.

Figure 58 shows the movement of the five position sensors in the central location through a cooling cycle. It shows that the motion is close to a rotation about the point where the locking point is bonded to the carbon fibre c-channel at the edge of the structure.

This figure also demonstrates how close to the original position the structure returns after a cool-down. Note that away from the central location the motion is not simply a rotation, as is clear from Figure 56. The discrepancy in return point led to long-term studies of stability. In particular the effects of humidity were not understood. This motion is rapid compared with the thermal equilibrium time of stave, as shown in Figure 59. Points are taken at equal intervals over a period of about 3 hours, a low point density corresponds to a rapid motion. The data in Figure 59 is the same as in Figure 58. It should be noted that the equivalent plots at early times showed considerably less convergence between starting and ending positions in the cycle, which was attributed to the additional effect of drying. Similar plots are given later for much slower time variations in temperature, but the overall difference in starting and ending positions through temperature changes remains similar at a few to several microns.

Figure 59: Temperature versus position for the cooling cycle in Figure 58.

One important requirement for any motion during cool-down is repeatability. To assess the repeatability of the motion during cooling to -25degC, four cooling cycles were executed with a day between them. These are shown in Figure 60 and Figure 61 for the centre outer edge of the stave overlaid in two different ways. In Figure 60 the data are aligned using the spike in temperature and motion as the evaporative system first starts to cool. Whilst the system never stabilises (the cooling system is a blow-off configuration and was not capable of extended running) an estimate of the difference in movement can be obtained by comparing the change in position during the plateau region of the motion. The starting positions are also normalised at the spike location. The difference in movement is less than 2.5um. As the cool-down behaviour is not quite identical, the second cooling drop as the system stabilises was also used to align the data, as is show in Figure 61. In this case the spread is slightly smaller at 2.0um. The small improvement using the secondary peak to align suggests that the spread is due mostly to the differences in temperature achieved at a given time and the conclusion is that the change in position during repeated cool-down cycles is extremely good.

Two long-term studies were undertaken. The first was simple observation of the five central position sensors, as above, for an extended period. These are not reported, but exhibit the same phenomena as the second set, which were taken with a load applied transversely to the free edge of the stave, as shown in Figure 62. This was done to exaggerate any creep and also to better emulate the fact that in many orientations the stave would be gravitationally loaded.

Figure 62: Transverse load pulley. Also visible are the capacitance distance probes to the right.

The load is applied using a pulley and 400g mass. This ensures a position and time independent force. Figure 63 shows data taken over a period of 1400 hours for the central position sensors. The gradual rotation of the structure is ascribed to drying out and greatly reduced after 650 hours, after which the system was manipulated in various ways to search for other effects. The spikes are cooling periods, where the temperature of the stave is reduced from room temperature to -25\({}^{\circ}\)C and then allowed to return to room temperature. An example of such a spike has already been shown in Figure 58.

The feature at 1130 hours is due to a minor mechanical disturbance to the optical table on which the chamber is resting. The features at 1350 and 1400 hours are the result of the remote ends of the flexible cooling pipes being manipulated. This implies that the mechanical decoupling of the pipes from the external system is far from adequate.

After the dry-out observed at 650 hours the temperature of the system was deliberately varied, to an extent, very slowly to measure the temperature versus position correlation for slow speed motion. An example is given in Figure 64. The data from rising and falling periods are separated by symbol in the plot. The system started at (25\({}^{\circ}\)C, -128.8\(\upmu\)m) and ended at (24.1\({}^{\circ}\)C, -128.4\(\upmu\)m).

Figure 64: Left: Motion of S1 (in \(\upmu\)m) through the temperature variation shown on the right.

Figure 63: Deflection (in \(\upmu\)m) vs time (in hours). Temperature (in \({}^{\circ}\)C) is shown on the same scale (the positive value line).

The time for these temperature variations were very slow so that the stave was in thermal equilibrium, as is evidenced by the exact tracking of the two sensors located at different places on the stave (Figure 64). In this case 1.5um different positions are seen for the same temperature at 24.1degC. A second example is shown in Figure 65, the data for which was collected by deliberately heating the room in which the chamber was located. Again the temperature variations were very slow.

A notable feature of these plots is that the shifts in position per degree are much larger than in the case of cooling. The stave does not return to the original starting position, but exhibits a hysteresis of about 7um. However, the difference between the positions during heating and cooling is much less marked than in the case shown in Figure 59, where the change in temperature is very rapid.

### Further Tests

A continuing programme of tests to identify the source of motions is underway. These include monitoring pipe motion and construction of additional stave panels with controlled gluing arrangements between locking points and panel.

## 12 Pull tests

We have carried out a series of pull tests on intermediate locking points to establish what load is needed to slide the lock core out of its bracket housing when it is locked. Two tests were carried out; one on a single locking point and one on a stave that has all five intermediate locking points locked.

### Single locking point pull test

The force required to pull a single locking point out of its bracket when it is locked was measured with a Lloyd Instruments LRXPus pull test machine with a 100N load cell (Figure 67). The deviation of a linear load-displacement curve is a sign of sliding between the locked parts. The test was repeated several times and a peak load between 18 and 20N was recorded for each test when the lock core starts to slide.

### Pull test on a stave with five intermediate locking points

A second pull test was carried out on the sector prototype using a spring balance to pull a stave out of its brackets when it is fully (all five points) locked. The force required to pull the stave out of the brackets is about 9.0kg, which is equivalent to 90N (for five locks), or 18N per lock. This measurement compares well to the single locking point pull test. This also implies a reasonably good alignment for the positions of the locking point components.

### Discussion of pull test results

A stave is a composite structure with three principal lengthways constituents: carbon fibres, cyanate ester matrix and the Titanium cooling tube. These three parts contribute to the overall Young's modulus and CTE of a stave. Treating the stave as a mixture of these elements results in an effective Young's modulus of 129GPa acting over 58mm\({}^{2}\) (the cross sectional area of the skins and pipe). From this it is possible to see that for a cool-down of 50\({}^{\circ}\)C the stave will contract 258um along its length, or, if it would be constrained with zero length reduction, would exert a force of 1467N on the external constraint (locking points).

Figure 67: Single locking point pull test.

As discussed above the locking points can constrain a force of 90N, so evidently the stave will slide in longitudinally in the locking points. The exact free end motion is hard to predict quantitatively but will be close to 0.25mm. These studies show that for a realistic stave the friction contact in the locking points will not induce significant stresses in the stave or the locking points.

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:48]

An FEA study on the new locking bracket design has been carried out to make sure that the stress is within the allowable limit during the locking operation in the optimized design. During locking, the cam will pass over a "hump" on the bracket before being seated in the locked position. In this process the bracket will be forced to open by as much as 0.1mm. For such a deformation the FEA gives a maximum local bending stress of 53MPa on the locking bracket (Figure 69). For comparison, the flexural yield strength for Ticona Vectra* A130 Liquid Crystal Polymer (LCP) is 280MPa. The stresses induced during the locking should therefore be well below the yield strength of the material.

As can be seen from Table 4 all the locking components within the barrel tracker acceptance (excl. the 1.3m fixations), using the optimized intermediate locking point design, add up to about 0.11% of a radiation length.

## 14 Future activities

While the programme described in this report provides a complete picture, sufficient to convince us that the suggested solution for the stave mounting of the strip barrel staves will perform as required, there are further studies which will be required for the final design. Some of the topics we still want to pursue are

* Prototyping the low mass version of locking points,
* Understanding the correct number of locking points,
* Understanding the tooling for attachment of all brackets to the cylinders,
* Understanding the minimum tilt angle compatible with the proposed 130nm stave design,
* Testing the insertion in the full size barrel mock-up,
* Developing the stave frame mounting for use within the confined space of the Outer Cylinder (with barrel service modules present),
* Verification of the locking point stiffness with modal analysis,
* Study of long term performance of the locking points and their attachment to the staves (creep, irradiation, moisture changes).
