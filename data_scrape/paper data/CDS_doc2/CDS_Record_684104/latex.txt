###### Abstract

By using the X-ray facility (XTOMO) a new method suitable for the high precision coordinate calibration of _superlayer_ MDT muon chambers in 'passive' mode was developed. The first results from the one-dimensional scanning of 8-layer MDT prototype are discussed.

Introduction

XTOMO 1, a 600 mm one dimensional X-ray scanner, was used for elaboration of the high precision _coordinate calibration_ method for MDT muon chambers. In the previous work, [1], two scanning modes -- _passive_ and _active_, were tested with a 6-layer MDT prototype. There was demonstrated the X-ray _location_ of the drift tubes sensitive wires through _whole depth_ of the chamber -- by using the 'active mode' scanning.

Footnote 1: X-Ray Tomography for MDT muon chambers’, CERN-JINR Collaboration (from 1994).

The 'active mode',which it is used under MDT working conditions i.e. 3 atm pressure and 3200 V voltage, is very promising for the final quality acceptance of muon chambers, [2]. But for the current investigations of the MDT production technology, i.e. mechanical quality, the 'passive mode' is more suitable. In this work it was developed so to make measuring the wire positions in the whole cross section of real MDT muon chambers.

This note is organized as follows: section 2 describes the technical solution of the new method and some hardware & software improvements, i.e. a long plastic scintillator, the reference ruler and the stepping cycle of scanning; section 3 presents the first tests and measurements with the help of the new method, i.e (1) the accuracy test of the scanner and (2) one-dimensional scanning of a realistic 8-layer MDT muon chamber prototype; section 4 presents the conclusions.

## 2 Development of the 'passive mode' scanning technique

Two main hardware implementations were done: (a) the X-ray counter was separated from the Scanning Head; (b) the calibration ruler as an accuracy reference system was added.

One new software developments were incorporated into the X-ray scanning method as whole: the so called _stepping_ scanning cycle.

### New scanning scheme

The first scheme of the 'passive' scan (with help of the Scanning HEAD-1, [1]) had an essential defect: the measured object is placed _between_ two collimators. An enormous bulky support for the X-ray beam collimators (with a small scintillator counter) must be used for real MDT muon chambers. This problem was solved in the case of the 'active mode' & HEAD-2.

Fig.1 shows the new 'passive mode' scanning scheme with help of the Scanning HEAD-2. A narrow X-ray beam formed by two collimating slits, C1 and C2, from the one side of a chamber is detected by a long (\(400\times 50\times 20\) mm\({}^{3}\)) plastic scintillator counter placed on the opposite side. The counter was equipped with one photomultiplier2. Its signals, after being discriminated and shaped, were stored by a CAMAC scaler. The scanning range in such a scheme is defined only by the Linear Stage itself. The plastic scintillator counter can be segmented so to cover the whole distance or it could be small and movable (not precisely!) in accordance with the current position of the X-ray source.

### Calibration ruler

In all the scanning schemes the accuracy of the measurement is limited the Linear Encoder mounted inside a linear stage. Due to the errors in the other parameters (X-ray beam inclination angle, straightness, pitch, and so on) the accuracy degrades with a distance from the linear stage. To improve this situation and to check the accuracy of the scanner as whole, the special _reference ruler_ was introduced into the scanning scheme (see fig.1).

The design of the ruler is shown in fig.2. The reference ruler consists of 20 gold plated tungsten wires of 50 \(\mu\)m diameter. The wires are glued carefully on the reference surface of a rigid 630 mm aluminium frame, so that they are parallel and spaced at 30 mm. The wires were properly stretched and soldered to the laminated Cu-foil strips on sides of the frame. An optical microscope is used to check the glueing and fixation procedure. A highly accurate optical scanner3 measured the wire positions with an accuracy up to \(\pm 3\)\(\mu\)m. Fig.3 shows the measured coordinates of the wires in the X-Z plane.

Fig.4 shows the typical wire signals measured with the new scanning scheme (1 meter MPI muon chamber prototype, X-ray beam inclination angle was equal to \(\sim 30^{o}\)). The first three signals are from the wires of the top multilayer, the last three from the bottom one; between them a signal from the calibration ruler is placed. This pattern is repeated along the whole scanning distance.

**It was a very important achievement:** for first time the _whole depth_ of an MDT muon chamber + reference ruler were scanned by the 'passive mode'.

### Stepping scanning cycle

The X-Tomograph is controlled by a PC (IBM 386 type) through the CAMAC4 and AEROTECH5 Motion controllers. A C-language steering program uses the library of the Linear Stage motion commands and provides the _scanning cycle_ - Linear Stage moving, x-ray quanta counting and data storage.

Footnote 4: CAMAC controller KK-009, JINR, Dubna

Footnote 5: See AEROTECH Catalogs

All investigations before were done with the help of the steering program SCAN3.C with a _smooth or 'in fly'_ scanning cycle, see [1]. For example, the X-ray beam was moved with a constant velocity (0.5 mm/s), and measured data were stored every 40 ms.

Here a new program, SCAN5.C, with a _stepping_ cycle was tested. The program is supplied with the preliminary positions of the wires. In the small range (0.5 mm) around a wire (or \(\sim\) 5 mm around a group of wires) it moves step by step: the scan is performed of 20 \(\mu\)m steps and waiting time for each measurements was 40 ms. Between the neighbouring wire groups the Linear Stage moves with a high velocity (\(\sim\)5 mm/s).

Fig.5 presents both types of scanning cycle outputs. The results do not differ significantly. But the second program is at least 5 times a fast and the memory space more economical.

Note a slow changing of the X-ray counting rate along the scanning distance due to the light attenuation length of the plastic scintillator.

It is clear the best features of these programs can be combined so to realize a _smooth_ cycle with _variable velocity_: the slow, smooth scanning around wire positions and fast movement between them. Moreover, more accurate positions of the next wires can be 'predicted' by the program automatically.

## 3 Tests & Measurements

### Calibration procedure

A special X-ray scanning of the reference ruler gave firstly a direct checking of the XTOMO scanner accuracy. The ruler was mounted on top of the scintillator counter and tuned to be nearly parallel to the Linear Stage. The first 13 wire positions were measured in the forward and backward directions. Table 1 presents the scanning parameters.

Fig.6 demostrates the fit procedure (4 parameter fit) performed for the third wire, and fig.7 shows the distribution of the differences in wire positions between forward and backward scanning. The mechanical repeatability of the linear stage was \(\approx 1\)\(\mu\)m.

Taking into account the calibration curves of the linear stage - position, straightness and jaw - the distances of the second up to the thirteenth wires from the first one (\(R^{o}_{1j}\) and \(R^{t}_{1j}\) where \(j=2,13\)) are determined for the optical and X-ray Tomography measurements, respectively. Fig.8 shows the distance differences between the two methods. The systematic increase of the distance differences - with respect to

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|} \hline High Tension & 38 kV \\ \hline Current & 6 mA \\ \hline Collimator gap & 20 \(\mu\)m \\ \hline Scanning step & 20 \(\mu\)m \\ \hline Scanning distance & 400 mm \\ \hline Scanning angle & 30\({}^{o}\) \\ \hline Scanning program & SCAN5.C \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}

the first wire - was due to the misalignment of reference ruler with respect to the scanning axis. By fitting the data this angle is found to be equal 0.251 mrad.

Fig.9 shows the residual distribution of the distance differences between optical and XTOMO measurings after the correction for the above mentioned ruler angular displacement. The r.m.s. of \(\approx 5\mu m\) is the _XTOMO accuracy_ estimation achieved for a scanning distance of 400 mm.

It is clear that such a _calibration system_ made out from the material with zero temperature expansion coefficient (TEC) will be very useful in the final, large scale X-ray Tomograph.

### Measuring of the 8-layers MDT chamber

MDT muon chamber prototype with 8 layers of Al drift tubes was produced by the Frascati/Cosenza group, see fig.10. The length of chamber is equal to 800 mm, with the diameter of tungsten wires 50 \(\mu\)m. Two 4-layer packages, the so called multilayers, are mounted on the common Al support.

For the one-dimensional scanning (XTOMO) of this chamber a very small scanning angle was used (\(\theta=7.5^{o}\)). A Monte Carlo program is used for the selection of the scanning angle, [3]. Accordingly, to measure properly the in-layer distances (along the X coordinate) between signal wires, reducing contributions from the wire position displacements along Z coordinate. So,

\[\Delta s=\sqrt{(\Delta X)^{2}\ +\ (\tan 7.5^{o}\cdot\Delta Z)^{2}}=\sqrt{( \Delta X)^{2}\ +\ 0.017\cdot(\Delta Z)^{2}}\qquad.\]

A new, longer (\(800\times 80\times 30\) mm\({}^{3}\)) plastic scintillator counter was constructed for this measurement6.

Fig.11 presents the raw data as a total scanning curve and, separately, some its parts being zoomed. XTOMO parameters values are in the Table 2.

Certainly, the scanning curve is a very high resolution measurement of the amount of material along the X-ray beam direction. The wire signal values are defined by the tungsten X-ray attenuation coefficient and by the divergency of the beam itself. It can be

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|} \hline High Tension & 44 kV \\ \hline Current & 14 mA \\ \hline Collimator gap & 50 \(\mu\)m \\ \hline Scanning step & 20 \(\mu\)m \\ \hline Scanning distance & 560 mm \\ \hline Scanning angle & 7.5\({}^{o}\) \\ \hline Scanning program & SCAN3.C \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 2: The operating conditions of the XTOMO when the Frascati/Cosenza muon chamber was scanned.

seen that the signals from the bottom multilayer are a bit smaller - due to increase of the X-ray beam's width. An overall X-ray counting rate is increasing when the X-ray beam is moving towards the photomultiplier end of the scintillator counter - due to light attenuation in the scintillator. Some wire signals are lost under the 'X-ray shadows' from the Al support of the chamber.

Due to the chamber's regular geometrical structure, the scanning curve's 'wire signals' were easily matched to the drift tube numbers, see fig.12 and fig.13. A simple, PAW environment analysing program (ITALY.KUM) was developed 7 for finding and fitting the wire signals. The 'wire peak' finding algorithm is based on the fact that the scanning curve's derivative has a clear bipolar signal where a wire is placed. Background signals are from the Al tube walls in places where X-ray beam is tangent to the wall. But they are not symmetrical. Of course, the chamber's regular geometry simplifies this problem.

Footnote 7: On base of the program PICTURE.KUM, [1]

Fig.14 shows the main results of this measurement: in-layer distances between wires are distributed with \(\sigma=28\)\(\mu\)m around the average value 30.050 \(\mu\)m. The quality of both multilayers is the same. Due to the high counting statistics the wire signal fittings have a negligible error.

## 4 Conclusion

The variant of the 'passive mode' X-ray scanning method described here provides possibility for cross section measurement of real MDT muon chambers. The X-ray beam intensity, its width and divergency, the on-line scanning algorithm, efficiency of the scintillator counter have been shown to be suitable for the precision scanning through 8 layers of drift tubes.

Some additional improvements of the X-ray scanning method were tested such as the calibration ruler and the stepping algorithm.
