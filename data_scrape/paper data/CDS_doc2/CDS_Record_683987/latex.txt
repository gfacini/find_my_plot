Introduction

For Higgs-boson masses close to 170 GeV, the signal significance in the \(H\to ZZ^{*}\to 4l\) channel is reduced, due to the suppression of the \(ZZ^{*}\) branching ratio as the \(WW\) decay mode opens up. For \(m_{H}=170\) GeV, the \(H\to WW^{(*)}\to l^{+}\nu l^{-}\nu\) branching ratio is approximately 100 times larger than that of the \(H\to ZZ^{*}\to 4l\) channel. In the case of \(H\to WW^{(*)}\to l^{+}\nu l^{-}\nu\) decays, however, it is not possible to reconstruct the Higgs-boson mass peak. Instead, an excess of events may be observed, and then used to identify the presence of a Higgs-boson signal and to extract information on its mass.

Based on the method suggest in [1], the potential for a discovery of the Higgs boson in the \(H\to WW^{(*)}\to l^{+}\nu l^{-}\nu\) decay mode has been investigated for Higgs-boson masses in the range between 150 and 190 GeV. The analysis presented here is based on fast detector simulation for final states containing electrons and muons. The signal cross section times leptonic branching ratio for the \(H\to WW^{(*)}\to l^{+}\nu l^{-}\nu\) decay is found to be between 0.61 and 0.80 pb over the mass range considered. Decays into \(\tau\)-leptons, where the \(\tau\)-leptons decay leptonically into electrons or muons have been taken into account in the analysis.

## 2 Background contributions

There are many irreducible and reducible background contributions, and the most important ones are listed in Table 1:

* The dominant irreducible background arises from \(WW\) continuum production, which has a cross-section times branching ratio between six and nine times larger than that of the Higgs-boson signal.
* \(W\) production with \(W\to l\nu\), \(Z\to ll\) and \(ZZ\) production with \(Z\to ll\) and \(Z\to\nu\nu\) also constitute a source of potentially irreducible background;
* \(t\bar{t}\) and \(Wt\) production are the source of the largest reducible backgrounds with isolated leptons in the final state. The cross section for the \(Wt\) background has been calculated recently by three different groups and is 4.0 pb (leptonic branching ratios included) compared to 4.8 pb in the TDR (see [2]);
* \(Wb\overline{b}\) and direct \(b\overline{b}\) production, containing one or two leptons from semileptonic \(b\)-decays, are the dominant sources of reducible background with non-isolatedleptons in the final state. These are considerably suppressed by the lepton \(p_{T}\)-threshold cuts and by isolation cuts.
* Finally, \(W\)+jet production, where a jet is mistaken as an electron, may also be a source of significant background.

## 3 Selection cuts

In order to discriminate the signal from the most dangerous background processes, the following selection cuts are applied:

* Two isolated leptons with opposite sign are required within \(|\eta|<2.5\) and with transerve momenta, \(p_{T}^{1}>20\) GeV and \(p_{T}^{2}>10\) GeV. At high luminosity, the cut on the leading lepton is raised to 30 GeV for trigger purposes.
* Significant missing transverse momentum is required, \(E_{T}^{m_{t}\,ss}>40\) GeV.
* The dilepton invariant mass is required to be smaller than 80 GeV.
* The opening angle (\(\Delta\phi\)) between the two leptons in the transverse plane is required to be smaller than 1.0 (measured in \(rad\)).
* The absolute value of the polar angle \(\Theta_{ll}\) of the di-lepton system is required to be smaller than 0.9.
* The absolute value of the pseudorapidity difference (\(\Delta\eta\)) between the two leptons is required to be smaller than 1.5.
* Events with one or more jets with \(p_{T}>\)15 GeV and \(|\eta|<3.2\) are rejected. At high luminosity, the \(p_{T}\)-threshold of this jet-veto cut is raised to 30 GeV. The effect of the different \(p_{T}\) threshold can be seen in Table 5.
* The transverse mass computed from the leptons and the missing transverse momentum, \[m_{T}=\sqrt{(2p_{T}^{\mu}E_{T}^{m_{t}\,ss}(1-\cos(\Delta\theta))}\] is required to fall in the mass window \(m_{\,H}\)-30 GeV\(<m_{\,T}<m_{\,H}\). Since the \(WW^{*}\) background is falling with increasing transverse mass, the lower cut value is reduced to the value \(m_{\,H}-40\) GeV for Higgs-boson masses above 170 GeV, in order to recover signal efficiency.

The dilepton invariant-mass cut mainly rejects background events where the lepton pair originates from a \(Z\)-boson. This cut has a large rejection against the \(WZ\) and \(ZZ\) background. The jet-veto cut is introduced to reject the \(t\overline{t}\) and \(Wt\) backgrounds, which are charaterised by large hadronic activity. The \(p_{T}\)-threshold of this jet-veto cut has unfortunately to be raised at high luminosity, which makes it much less effective and results in an increased residual \(t\overline{t}\) background. The dominant irreducible background from \(WW^{*}\) production is reduced by the angular cuts on the di-lepton system. The small angular separation between leptons in signal events results from the opposite spin orientation of the \(W\) pair originating from the decay of the scalar Higgs-boson.

The discrimination between the signal and the most important backgrounds is shown for the pseudorapidity difference, \(\left|\Delta\eta\right|\), and the azimuthal difference, \(\Delta\phi\), between the two leptons, respectively, in Figures 1 and 2.

In Table 2, the cross sections times branching ratios, the acceptances and the numbers of exepected \(H\to WW^{(*)}\to l^{+}\nu l^{-}\nu\) signal events are given as a function of \(m_{H}\) and for an integrated luminosity of \(30\;\mbox{fb}^{-1}\). Over the mass range considered, the signal acceptance varies between 0.9 and 1.6%. In addition to this kinematic acceptance, a nominal identification and reconstruction efficiency of 90% per lepton has been assumed to obtain the signal event rates.

The numbers of expected background events in the selected transverse mass range are also given in Table 2, after all cuts are applied, for an integrated luminosity of \(30\;\mbox{fb}^{-1}\). Due to the sliding window cut as a function of the Higgs-boson mass, also the backgrounds contribution is mass dependent. Thanks to the strict jet-veto cut applied at low luminosity, the \(t\overline{t}\) background is at a level between 8 and 20% of the irreducible \(WW^{*}\) background over the mass range considered. Single top production is found to be the dominant reducible background. A good signal-to-background ratio is obtained over the Higgs-boson mass range, with a maximum value of 0.7 for \(m_{H}=170\;\mbox{GeV}\). At high luminosity, the \(t\overline{t}\) and \(Wt\) background rejection is reduced and \(t\overline{t}\) production is a significant reducible background, at the same level as the irreducible \(WW^{*}\) background.

## 4 Mass distribution and signal significance

The distribution of the transverse mass is shown in Figure 3 and 4 for the sum of signal and background and for the background alone. The contribution from single top production and from \(t\overline{t}\) production is also shown separately by the shaded histogram. The results are shown for \(m_{H}=150\) and \(170\;\mbox{GeV}\) and for an integrated luminosity of 30 fb\({}^{-1}\). Since there is no mass peak reconstructed in this channel, evidence for a Higgs-boson signal has to be deduced from an excess of events in the regions of transverse mass defined above. These regions are indicated by the two dotted lines.

The signal significance in this channel depends critically of the absolute knowledge of the various backgrounds. The cuts applied can be relaxed to some extent and a normalisation between the Monte Carlo prediction and the data can then be performed in regions, where only a small fraction of the signal is expected.

To evaluate the significance, it has been optimistically assumed that such a normalisation can be performed to an overall accuracy of \(\pm 5\%\), i.e. that the summed \(WW^{*}\), \(t\overline{t}\), and \(Wt\) background is known with a systematic uncertainty of \(\pm 5\%\). This uncertainty is larger than the statistical uncertainty on the background. Taking this into account, the signal significance estimated for an integrated luminosity of 30 fb\({}^{-1}\) is above 5\(\sigma\) for \(\sim 150<m_{\,H}<190\) GeV. Because of the less effective jet veto the residual \(t\overline{t}\) and \(Wt\) backgrounds increase considerably at high luminosity. The numbers of expected signal and background events are given in Table 3, assuming high-luminosity running and an integrated luminosity of 100 fb\({}^{-1}\). Due to the strong increase of the \(t\overline{t}\) and \(Wt\) background, the statistical significance does not improve significantly compared to the low-luminosity running. The final signal significance which can be obtained with an integrated luminosity of 100 fb\({}^{-1}\), is computed from a combination of the significance achieved after low-luminosity operation over 30 fb\({}^{-1}\) and high-luminosity operation over 70 fb\({}^{-1}\), assuming a fully correlated systematic error on the background.

The comparison of Tables 2 and 3 shows that the \(H\to WW^{(*)}\to l^{+}\nu l^{-}\nu\) channel may have better sensitivity than the \(H\to ZZ^{*}\to 4l\) channel for 160\(<m_{\,H}<\)175 GeV, provided the small systematic uncertainty of \(\pm 5\%\) on the total background can be achieved.

Figure 6 shows the sensitivity for the discovery of a Standard model Higgs boson in the mass range between 150 - 190 GeV assuming integrated luminosities of 30 fb\({}^{-1}\) and 100 fb\({}^{-1}\). A systematic uncertainty of \(\pm 5\%\) on the total numbers of background events has been included. No K-factor has been applied.

Finally, it is important to note that constraints on the Higgs-boson mass can be extracted from the transverse mass distribution. As an example, the transverse mass distributions for \(m_{\,H}=160\) GeV and \(m_{\,H}=170\) GeV are compared for the summed signal plus background in Figure 5. A sensitivity to the Higgs-boson mass is obtained from the upper edge of the distribution. The experimental resolution on the missing transverse energy defines the shape of this upper edge.

The distributions in Figure 5 can be separated with a purely statistical significance of 6 \(\sigma\). Systematic uncertainties have not been studied yet, but the Higgs-boson mass can hopefully be constrained to better than \(\pm 5\) GeV in this channel.

## 5 Comparision between PYTHIA 5.7 and ONETOP

The \(Wt\) process is not correctly implemented in the PYTHIA Monte Carlo. The program PYTHIA neglects mass effects in the matrix element expressions. To estimate the cross section the program ONETOP was used. A comparision between ONETOP and PYTHIA 5.7 showed that the number of selected events for the \(Wt\) background is 82 with ONETOP compared to 95 with PYTHIA assuming the cross section calculated with ONETOP. For the \(t\bar{t}\) background the number of selected events is 55 with ONETOP compared to 51 with PYTHIA. For the \(Wt\) background the cross section has recently been calculated by three different groups. The value for the calculated cross section is around 60 pb([2]) which corresponds to 4 pb for the leptonic decay. Figure 7 shows the \(p_{T}\) distribution of the leptons and the \(p_{T}\) distribution of the jets. The average \(p_{T}\) of the leptons and the jets is 20% lower in PYTHIA5.7 compared to ONETOP. In PYTHIA 5.7 the top quark is assumed to be massless, this effects the \(p_{T}\) distribution of the top decay products and results in a significantly lower \(p_{T}\).

## 6 Variation of the cuts

To check the sensitivity of the applied cuts the cuts on \(E_{T}^{miss}\), \(\Delta\phi\), \(|\Theta_{ll}|\) and \(|\Delta\eta|\) have been varied. The importance of the angular cuts \(|\Delta\eta|\) to reduce the irreducible \(WW^{*}\) background is obvious. The \(\eta\) cut and the \(p_{T}\) cut on the jet veto has been varied as well. The effects on \(S/\sqrt{B}\) are shown in Table 4 and 5. A variation of these cuts increases slightly the sensitivity in this channel (see Tables 6 and 7). The cuts have been varied in the following way:

* Events with one or more jets with \(p_{T}>\)15 GeV and \(|\eta|<\) 2.4 instead of 3.2 are rejected.
* The absolute value of the pseudorapidity difference (\(\Delta\eta\)) between the two leptons is required to be smaller than 1.2 instead of 1.5.
* The opening angle (\(\Delta\phi\)) between the two leptons in the transverse plane is required to be smaller than 1.2 instead of 1.0 (measured in \(rad\)).

A systematic variation of the cuts can further increase the signal significance.

## 7 Summary

It has been shown that the decay mode \(H\to WW^{(*)}\to l^{+}\nu l^{-}\nu\) is a complementary Higgs search mode to the decay mode \(H\to ZZ^{*}\to 4l\) at LHC for Higgs-boson masses around 170 GeV. The signal significance which can be obtained with an integrated luminosity of 30 fb\({}^{-1}\) is between 5.8 and 14.1 for Higgs-boson masses between 150 and 190 GeV. Compared to the ATLAS Physics TDR [3] the cuts has been optimised and the resulting \(S/\sqrt{B}\) is up to 20% better compared to the values quoted in the TDR. Another reason for the improvement is the reduced cross section of the \(Wt\) background (20% smaller compared to the value used in the TDR) due to the new cross section calculations.
