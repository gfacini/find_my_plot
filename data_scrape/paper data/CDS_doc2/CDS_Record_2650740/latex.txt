# HBSM Working Group 2HDM+S Summary Plots

The ATLAS Collaboration

This note presents the most recent summary plots summarizing the results of the exotic Higgs decay searches from ATLAS HBSM Working Group.

This document replaces the original, dated \(10^{th}\) December 2018, replacing "Run 1" with "Run 2" in the legend for all the \(\gamma\gamma jj\) search results.

## 1 ATLAS results used in 2HDM+S summary plots

The analysis results are from the following ATLAS searches for the exotic decays of the 125 GeV Higgs boson:

* Direct search for exotic Higgs boson decays to two spin-zero particles in the H\(\rightarrow\)2a\(\rightarrow\)4b channel in \(pp\) collisions at \(\sqrt{s}\) = 13 TeV with the ATLAS detector. [2]
* Search for Higgs bosons decaying to \(aa\) in the \(\mu\mu\tau\tau\) final state in \(pp\) collisions at \(\sqrt{s}\)= 8 TeV with the ATLAS experiment. [3]
* Search for a Higgs boson decaying to pseudoscalar pairs in the \(bb\mu\mu\) final state at \(\sqrt{s}\) = 13 TeV with the ATLAS detector. [4]
* Search for Higgs decays to beyond the standard model light bosons in four-lepton events with the ATLAS detector \(\sqrt{s}\) = 13 TeV. [5]
* Search for new phenomena in events with at least three photons collected in \(pp\) collisions at \(\sqrt{s}\) = 8 TeV with the ATLAS detector. [6]
* Search for Higgs boson decaying to \(aa\) in the \(\gamma\gamma jj\) final state in pp collisions at \(\sqrt{s}\) =13 TeV with the ATLAS detector. [7]
