Collaboration is concentrating it's work on the hadron induced change in the silicon bulk. Their results, mainly obtained through irradiation and characterisation of simple test diodes, lead to the insight, that a higher oxygen enrichment of the silicon bulk is advantages for several reasons[2]. Firstly, if the radiation environment contains a significant component of charged hadrons, the effective doping concentration after irradiation is lowered by oxygenation of the material. Secondly the reverse annealing saturates at fluences above \(2\cdot 10^{14}\) p/cm\({}^{2}\) and the rate of growth of the effective doping density with time after irradiation is a factor 2 to 4 slower at the same temperature. As a consequence the sensors can be kept for a longer period at room temperature, which gives an additional safety margin, if longer maintenance periods are needed in the experiment. As a final step these two approaches, the careful design and the oxygen enrichment, have to be combined and the full technology have to be implemented in the process of a company, capable of the large scale production for the future LHC experiments. Therefore the design and technology of the MPI Semiconductor Laboratory (Halbleiterlabor) have been transferred to CiS, Germany, who did the oxygen enrichment in their process furnances and the fabrication of the sensors on this material.

A second approach to have a full depleted p\({}^{+}\)n detector after type inversion at moderate voltages is the usage of a thinner bulk. One intention of this paper is therefore the direct comparison between standard, thin standard, and oxygenated full size strip detectors which have undergone exactly the same processing steps, irradiated up to the same fluence, and read out with electronics at LHC speed.

## 2 Detector Design and Pre-Irradiation Characteristics

The basic design features, including the edge region and the properties of the p\({}^{+}\)n detectors after type inversion, are described already in [1]. The detectors tested here are wedge shaped, designed for the innermost ring of the ATLAS forward region[4]. They have 768 capacitively coupled readout strips with an active lenght of 7.2 cm, biased via implanted resistors. The mean pitch is 61.7 \(\mu\)m and the active surface of the detectors is \(\approx\) 35 cm\({}^{2}\).

Most of the tested sensors have been processed on oxygen enriched high resistivity material (2 to 5 k\(\Omega\)cm, \(<\)111\(>\), nominal thickness 280 \(\mu\)m). The oxygen diffusion was performed by placing oxidized wafers into a process furance at 1150\({}^{\circ}\)C in an inert ambient (N\({}_{2}\)) for 3\(\times\)8 h [5]. After this process the oxygen concentration in the middle of the wafers, measured on a seperate wafer by the SIMS method, was \(\approx 10^{17}\) at/cm\({}^{3}\), the carbon concentration was \(\approx 7\cdot 10^{15}\) at/cm\({}^{3}\)[6].

The current voltage charteristics of the 9 detectors after irradiation and first annealing are shown in Fig. 1 and Fig. 2. The currents were measured at \(-18^{\circ}\)C inside of a temperature controlled cabinet. Fig. 1 shows the results of the first irradiation of the detectors with various thicknesses. The currents at 350 V of all the detectors are around 165 \(\mu\)A with almost no dependency on the thickness. This becomes somewhat clearer, if one looks at the currents in Fig. 2, where four identical oxygen enriched detectors with the same nominal thickness have been measured and where the variation in the individual currents is similar. Even for this identical detectors the variation of the individual currents is in the order. The absolute value of the currents at 350 V and \(-18^{\circ}\)C is here around 145 \(\mu\)A. The reasons for the difference between these two irradiation results are mainly due to the uncertainty in the fluence during the irradiaton (which is estimated to be at the level of 10%) and the uncertainty in the actual temperature inside the cabinet where the measurements were performed. Within these errors, there is no difference between the currents of detectors on oxygen enriched and standard material.

### Static Measurements after Irradiation, Long Term Annealing

To investigate the differences between the various detector materials, the first five detectors from Table 1 have been taken through an annealing procedure far beyond the point of the minimal depletion voltage. In order to reduce the time requirements the annealing was performed at \(30^{\circ}\)C. This was then scaled to \(25^{\circ}\)C using the parametrisation from [7]. The procedure went on until an equivalent annealing time of 32 days at \(25^{\circ}\)C was reached. This is roughly 50% longer than the standard ATLAS 10 year warm-up scenario for maintenance[4], giving am additional safety factor in case of unforeseen problems during the 10 years lifetime of the SCT. Throughout this annealing period, every few days the detectors were cooled down to \(-18^{\circ}\)C to do the IV and CV measurements at different annealing stages. The CV measurements were done at a frequency of 100 Hz (the lowest possible with the LCR meter used). The "full depletion" voltage from this CV curves was extracted by a simple fit. It represents the voltage where the curve of \(1/C^{2}(V)\) goes into saturation. The IV curve was measured simultaneously. Fig. 3 shows the evolution of the currents (normalized to \(20^{\circ}\)C) at 350 V with annealing time and the damage parameter \(\alpha\) extracted from this measurements. It was calculated assuming a hardness factor 0.5 for the 24 GeV/c protons [2] and reaches for long annealing times \(4.5\cdot 10^{17}\)_A/cm_. It was found to be the same for all detectors independent the oxygen concentration in the substrate. The advantage of oxygen enriched detector material becomes evident, if one looks at the "full depletion voltage" extracted from CV measurements. This is shown in Fig. 4. The difference in the full depletion voltage between standard and oxygen enriched material is minimal at the end of the beneficial annealing and increases with annealingtime. The lower plot in Fig. 4, where the full depletion voltages from the CV curves are normalized to 300\(\mu\)m thickness, makes the difference between the two materials used even more distinct and shows clearly the suppresion of the reverse annealing for oxygen enriched material. Table 2 summarises these results.

### Charge Collection Efficiency

The differences between the full depletion voltages from CV curves of the standard and the oxygenated material of the same thickness are 34 V after 7 days and 78 V after 32 days at 25\({}^{\circ}\)C. To investigate whether this differences can be seen also in the charge collection efficiency, 128 channels of the detectors were bonded to a single SCT128A chip. The frontend of this chip has a risetime of approx. 20 ns and the input stage is identical to that of the ABCD chip, the binary chip to be used in ATLAS SCT. But unlike the binary chip it has the advantage that the analogue information for each channel is directly accessible event by event. Thus making it fairly easy to extract reliable information on detector performance before and after irradiation.

Signal measurements were performed with a \({}^{90}\)Sr beta source. Signals from up to five consecutive strips are included in a signal cluster, assumed to include all signal charge generated by a traversing electron. Such a cluster is initiated by a seed of a strip with 4 \(\sigma\) signal and accepted when it has a total charge of at least 5 \(\sigma\) above the average noise of the particular channels. A Landau distribution (convoluted with a Gaussian) is fitted to the obtained pulse height spectrum.

The first measurements on 2 oxygenated, 2 thin and one standard material detector have been done after 7 days annealing. The signal heigths were then normalized to the signals from an unirradiated detector of 280 \(\mu\)m nominal thickness. All the measurements (also with the unirradiated detector) have been done at approx. \(-20^{\circ}\)C and with the readout in exactly the same operating conditions. The result is shown in Fig. 5. The onset of the plateau for the full CCE is extracted by a simple fit of two straight lines as shown in Fig. 5, in order to get comparable numbers for the three substrate types. This onset of the plateau is about 60 V lower for the oxygenated detectors. The situation for the thin detectors on standard material is less clear as this voltage depends of course on the actual thickness of the detector. The thinner detector (246 \(\mu\)m) shows about the same onset voltage as the oxygenated ones, but the penalty for this is a smaller signal.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|c||c|c|c|} \hline Detector & \(V_{fd}\) After 7d at 25\({}^{\circ}\)C & \(V_{fd}\) After 32d at 25\({}^{\circ}\)C & reverse annealing \\ \hline \hline standard & 149 V & 214 V & 65 V \\ \hline thin & 130 V & 181 V & 51 V \\ \hline oxygenated & 115 V & 136 V & 21 V \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 2: _Full depletion voltages from CV curves for the various detector types._These measurements have been repeated after the long term annealing. Fig. 6 shows the comparison between the standard and the oxygen enriched detector after 32 days at 25\({}^{\circ}\)C. The effect of reverse annealing of the standard detector is here much smaller. The voltage at the onset of the plateau increases only by 36 V for the standard detector and 32 V for the oxygenated one. The expected values from the CV measurements are 65 V for standard, resp. 21 V for oxygen enriched material. The reason for this is in the way the data is analysed. In the way described above we are summing up up to five consecutive strips to get the cluster charge. Due to the intrinsic nature of undepleted irradiated silicon[8] the generated charge diffuses through this region and is collected by a number of strips instead of being focussed by an electric field on one or two single strips. This means that almost the full signal charge is detected even in under-depleted operation of the detector. Fig. 7 shows the fraction of the total charge in the highest hit. The small difference in the absolute value between the two detectors is most likely due to the fact that the postion of the source relative to the detector and the scintillator for the trigger is not very well reproducibel. A slight displacement leads to more inclined tracks and therefore to a bigger charge spreading over the readout strips. The interesting feature is the dependence of the fraction with bias voltage. It indicates that the charge spreading below 400 V is much bigger for the standard material than for the oxygenated one.

due to the fact that in this way not all the charge is detected. The difference in the onset of the full CCE between standard and oxygen enriched material is now about 100 V.

## 4 Summary and Conclusions

Six strip detectors on oxygen enriched material and three detectors on standard material, two of those on nominally 260\(\mu\)m thick material, for the ATLAS forward region have been irradiated up to a fluence of \(3\cdot 10^{14}\,24\) GeV p/cm\({}^{2}\). The oxygen enrichment proposed by the ROSE collaboration has been integrated in the process line of a company capable of the large scale production needed for ATLAS. The oxygen enrichment did not affect the IV characteristics of the detectors, neither before nor after the irradiation. After irradiation the detectors went through a controlled annealing procedure up to an equivalent annealing time of 32 days at 25\({}^{\circ}\)C. The difference in the effective doping concentration after irradiation has been investigated by CV and signal measurements with a \({}^{90}\)Sr source and fast electronics. The results of the ROSE collaboration, obtained with simple diodes, were qualitatively reproduced with the tested full size strip detectors. At the end of the 32 days annealing period, the difference in the full depletion voltage from CV measurements between standard and oxygen enriched material was found to be about 80 V lower for the oxygenated material. The difference obtained with measurements of the

CCE with fast electronics (SCT128a) is about 100 V, if one looks only at the strip with the highest signal, simulating the use of binary electronics.

It was shown to be possible to build strip detectors on oxygen enriched material without deteriorating the basic characteristics of the devices before irradiation. After irradiation the lower effective doping concentration of oxygen enriched silicon leads to lower operating voltage giving more headroom for save operation in harsh radiation environments like in ATLAS.
