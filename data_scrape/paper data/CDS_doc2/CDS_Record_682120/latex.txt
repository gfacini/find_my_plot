## 1 Introduction

This note gives an update on the note PHYSICS-NO-001. The first section is devoted to a classification on the cross-section of the process H \(\sim\) y \(\gamma\). The second section gives some quantitative estimates of the effect of the rapidity coverage for the Higgs detection in this channel. The third section updates the numbers for the lepton y \(\gamma\) channel ( in particular new reducible backgrounds are evaluated). The fourth section gives signal and background rates for the H \(\sim\) Z \(\gamma\) - lepton lepton y channel which gives marginal signal for a small mass region. The fifth section describes simulation on the \(\pi\) 0 rejection using the preshower with the present EAGLE design (the question of the preshower granularity will be addressed). Finally the impact of the \(\gamma\) channels on the neutral Higgs sector of the Minimal Supersymmetric Model (MSSM) is updated.

The general assumptions are the same than in the previous note (top quark mass of 140 GeV, integrated luminosity of 100 fb-1). The unchanged details of the note.to which the reader is referred, will not be repeated here.

### 1 Cross-section Update for the 2 Photons Channel

The cross-sections for the process H -\(\gamma\) \(\gamma\) used in the note are the "old" values from Kunszt and Sturling ( and also the values used by Seez and Virdee in the Aachen study). The new values of the cross-sections ( given in the Aachen proceedings) are in fact \(\sim\) 25 % larger. Also in the note the small (but non negligible) contribution of the WW fusion process ( = 15 %) was neglected. Taking both effects into account, the cross-sections and subsequently the numbers of events and the statistical significances have to be increased by = 40 %. The table 1 gives these new values and therefore replaces the old table 1 of the note. All the other ingredients are taken to be the same (rapidity coverage.efficiency.etc..) Concerning the resolution the same parametrization is used, with a 1% constant term ( for 10%/sq(E) sampling term.an improvement of the constant term to 0.5% will only improve the significance by 5%). For the measurement of the photon direction in the \(\Theta\) direction, it has been shown in the note that a resolution on the photon direction better than 100 mrad/sqrt(E) does not contribute on the mass resolution. This resolution is assumed in all the following. ( If the photon direction is not measured, the RMS on the mass from the vertex spread in the \(z\) direction depends on the photon rapidity ( should be 0 for back to back photons at 0 rapidity) : This RMS is = 0.9 % for \(\eta\) between 0 and 0.5 and 1.7 % for \(\eta\) between 1 and 2, for a calorimeter radius of 1.3 m ). Figure 1 shows what an experiment will see (under these conditions with an integrated luminosity of 100 fb-1.for a Higgs mass of 100 GeV (assuming that the jet background has been reduced to a negligible level). Figure 2 shows the variation of the statistical significance with the Higgs mass. The improvement with respect to the note is trivially given by the cross-section increase of the signal.

It should be noted that this increase by a factor 1.4 has nothing to do with the QCD corrections on the Higgs production cross-section. The K factor from QCD corrections as been computed at first order in [1]

2.40 < : \(\eta\) | Outside Region (O)

The value of 2.4 for the End Cap has been used because this is the place in the End-Cap where the radial distance to the beam is devised by 2 with respect to the barrel. As we will see later this is the crucial parameter for the photon identification. The value of 1.57 for the end of the Central Region acceptance is an optimistic value (assuming that the calorimeter density is independent of \(\eta\)). If the density is changing with \(\eta\) in order to preserve the same sampling fraction of the calorimeter and the same sampling term in the resoluon, the end of the Central region acceptance will be at = 1.42.

According to the impact points of both photons, the events fulfilling the Pt cuts can be devised in 10 subsamples (C-C,C-E.C-F.C-O.E-E.E-F, E-O.F-F.F-O,O-O). The fraction of signal events in each subsample is given in Table 2 ( for a 100 GeV Higgs mass, for both values of the Central Region acceptance)

From this table.one can conclude (if \(\eta\) (central)=1.57)

1) A restriction to the C-C region only reduces significantly the acceptance (see previous section)

2) The F-F events are not very important. On the other hand C-F events increase significantly the acceptance (C-C + C-F)/(C-C) is 1.43

3) With the values used, the fraction of acceptance in the crack is not too large (C-C + C-F + F-F)/(full = 2.4) is 0.88 but this value decreases rapidly if the crack size increases and therefore this crack has to be under control.

Finally, if one is able to use C-C and C-F events the acceptance is almost the same than the full = 2.0 used in the first section and one expects to have the same significance. On the other hand.if one has to restrict to C-C events the significance will drop by 20 %.

If the acceptance of the central is only \(\pm\) 1.42.the C-C event rate will decrease by 15% and the C-C + C-F rate will decrease by 13% (the number of events with one photon in the crack increases by almost a factor 2).

c) Photon identification in the End-Caps

The problem of the photon identification and jet background rejection has been discussed in the note for the Central region.Before discussing the problem of this jet rejection in the End-Cap region.let us recall the needed values for the rejection. Clearly.in the Central region, to reject the jet background safely below the irreducible \(\gamma\) background, a rejection of 10000 is needed. For the End-Cap region, for one of the leg of dijet events one has already this rejection ( because it is possible to remove F-F events which have a small weight) and therefore a rejection smaller by a factor 2 can be tolerated (obviously there is no more the factor = 10 of safety). To be more quantitative, the jet- \(\gamma\) background for which this argument does not work has also to be taken into account and Figure 7 shows the improvement of statistical significance obtained using C-F and C-C events with respect to the C-C events alone as a function of the rejection in the End-Cap.assuming a rejection of 10000 in the barrel, taking into account both the irreducible background and the jet background coming from the lower rejection in the End-Cap region. Clearly.if the rejection in the End-Caps is only around 1000,the statistical significance is not improved because of the jet background introduced. To have an improvement close to the ideal value ( without jet background, a factor = 1.2 is expected) a rejection against jet of the order of 5000 is needed in the End-Cap region.

In order to simulate the jet background in the End-Cap region, it can be seen that for a given Pt of the jet.the separation between particles is constant in the \(\eta\) - \(\delta\) space as a function of the jet rapidity for the relevant region. This is just because the jets at rapidity around 2 are mainly boosted jets which are centrally produced in the parton center of mass. This can be checked by looking at jet events with Pt larger than 40 GeV generated with PYTHIA and the result is illustrated in Figure 8.

Taking thus effect into account, the same jets than the jets used for the sumulaton at \(\eta\) = 0 can be used. For \(\eta\) = 2.1 (the jets are going in the End-Cap. At this rapidity the radial distance to the beam is = 2 ames smaller than in the barrel and therefore for a same \(\eta\) - 0 separation the spatial separation (in cm is smaller by a factor 3 in the End-Cap than in the central which is equivalent to be in the barrel at \(\eta\) = 0 but at a radius 2 times smaller. In this approximation,the cell size of the calorimeter (given by the shower size) is assumed to be constant in cm and the variation of the shower shape with the energy of the incident particle is neglected. (probably these approximations are pessimistic)

After these considerations, the simulation done in the note for the jet rejection in the barrel has been redone to investigate the jet rejection in the End-Cap.using the same jet events generated with PYTHIA. Typically the rejection given by the calorimeter alone is reduced by a factor 2 because one starts to have multi \(\pi\) 0 events not rejected by the calorimeter.Therefore.to use the End-Cap for the H -> \(\gamma\) \(\gamma\) search, a preshower is also needed in this rejection. The rejection of isolated \(\pi\) 0 with the preshower is more difficult than in the barrel because the separation between the photons becomes smaller (for a given Pt of the parent) but the preshower can probably reject the multi \(\pi\) 0 background. If one extrapolate the simulation of the preshower in the barrel region of the note, one expects to have a total rejection against jets reduced by a factor = 2 to 2.5 at \(\eta\) = 2.4. Therefore a rejection of the order of 5000 should be obtained in the End-Cap region. (in the note the total rejection in the barrel is = 12000. see section 5 for more realistic simulation of the \(\pi\) 0 rejection with the preshower). This value of the rejection allows to use the End-Cap region to increase the statistical significance of the H -> \(\gamma\) \(\gamma\) signal but probably with a smaller safety margin than in the barrel.

**d) conclusion**

Clearly, the extension of the acceptance given by the End-Cap region can be important for the H -> \(\gamma\) search. The jet rejection is more difficult in this region but the needed value is probably accessible with a preshower in the End-Cap region.

**j) Update on the lepton and 2 photons channel**

The cross-section for the WH and tbarH production processes are the same than in the note. The conclusion of the note was that this channel provides a small signal rate of around 25 events for 100 tb-1 ( for 80 < M(H) < 130 GeV) with a background dominated by the irreducible W \(\gamma\) \(\gamma\) and tbar \(\gamma\) production of around 10 events under the signal. All the reducible backgrounds envisaged in the note were estimated to be significantly smaller (under the assumption that the jet rejection is around 10000). The case of electron misidentification was envisaged for the WZ -> lepton electron positron channel and the background from this source was found to be negligible but it has been pointed out ([3]) that the dominant background with electron misidentification as photon is the Z -> production from the continuum followed by Z -> electron pair with one of the electron misidentified as a photon.

We have estimated this background with PYTHIA. If an efficiency of 99 % is assumed to reject electrons. Figure 9 shows the mass spectrum M(\(\gamma\) - fake \(\gamma\) ) obtained after applying the same kinematical cuts than in the note (Pt > 25 GeV \(|\)\(\eta\)\(|\)\(<\) 2) With this value of the efficiency,this background is = 15 events under the signal and is therefore the dominant background in this channel. From this.it can be concluded that an better efficiency is wished ( 99.9 %). At this level,there can be also significant contribution from radiative decays of the Z with a very hard photon emitted,the electron being deflected strongly by the magnetic field ( the probability to have a radiative decay with a photon having more than 0.45 the center of mass energy is = 1% from the Berends and Kleiss programm [4]. This photon is mainly 

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:5]

As indicated before, the dominant background to this channel is the irreducible Z \(\gamma\) production. The contribution from the process q qbar -> Z \(\gamma\) -> leptons \(\gamma\) has been computed with PYTHIA. Figure 12 shows the Ptt \(\gamma\) distribution which peaks at 0 as expected. The number of events after applying the kinematical cuts are given in table 3. From this, the statistical significance of the signal can be deduced and the result is illustrated in the figure 12. A small improvement is possible by looking at the angular distribution of the photon in the center of mass (see figure 13) but after the kinematical cuts the statistical significance of the signal can be improved by only = 10% if a cut on cost \(\theta(\gamma)\) is used.

As indicated in the first section,no higher order correction on the cross sections are applied. These corrections increase the signal rate by = 80 % but the corrections to the background are not computed ( the gluon-gluon fusion process has also to be taken into account) and therefore no big improvement is to be expected. Concerning the reducible Z + jet background, his contribution is totally negligible with the rejection of 10000 against jets.

## 5 Rejection of Pt0 with the preshower

### a) introduction

First,let us recall that in the barrel,using an analysis of the shower shape,the calorimeter can select "isolated" \(\pi\) 0 events, corresponding to a rejection = 3000 against jets. Therefore, for the study of the preshower,the main element is the rejection against isolated \(\pi\) 0. In order to achieve the requested total rejection against jets, the preshower rejection against isolated \(\pi\) 0 should be at least = 3 for transverse momentum between 25 and 60 GeV. In the note, a simulation of a simplified compact preshower (3 X0 of Lead + 2 cm of Liquid Argon ) was described. The rejection obtained against isolated \(\pi\) 0 is = 5 ( for 90% efficiency) More realistic simulations of the preshower geometry have to be performed to check this rejection. Ref[5] gives results of the \(\pi\) 0 rejection in a EAGLEA like geometry with the coil integrated in the cryostat.The rejections obtained in [5] are = 3.5 to 4 both at central rapidity and at \(\eta\)=1.5 for Pt=50 GeV. In the following, we will describe simulations performed in the full EAGLEA geometry as implemented in DICE [6]. In particular we will try to investigate the impact of the preshower granularity and the effect of the pile-up

### b) geometry used in the simulation

The version of the EAGLEA geometry as implemented in DICE at the end of march is used. The important element for this simulation concern the preshower and are : The integrated coil-cryostat design [7] which covers = 20 cm and gives = 1 X0, 0.3 cm of Lead (at \(\eta\) =0) such that there is 2 X0 in front of the first preshower layer,0.5 cm of Lead (which give an additional radiation length) and the second preshower layer. The distance between the entrance of the cryostat and the last active layer of the Preshower is = 30 cm and and separation between the end of the preshower and the calorimeter is = 1 cm. Each active layer of the preshower consists of 1 cm of LAr segmented into strips.The segmentation used in the simulation is very fine (strips of 1mm*28mm in each direction) to allow to regroupe adjacent channels and to study the impact of the preshower granularity. The first layer of the preshower has a fine granularity in the 0 direction while the second layer gives precise measurements in the \(\eta\) direction. The separation of the 3PAGE 7

layers of the preshower is justified by a small improvement in the energy resolution after corrections based on the energy deposited in the preshower (see [8]).

The results presented here on the \(\gamma\) - \(\pi\) 0 separation have been obtained with the study of 2 samples of \(\gamma\) = [30] events generated at \(\eta\) = 0 = 0.01 and at Pt=50 GeV. 75 events have also been generated at Pt=75 GeV.

### 3c results and conclusions

First let us notice that the typical size of the photon shower in the preshower if = 5 mm in the second sampling_after 3 X0 (in agreement with RD3 test beam results),with large fluctuations from the fluctuations in the position of the conversion of the photon, and that the minimal spatial separation between two photons of an isolated \(\pi\) 0 with 50 GeV Pt is = 7 mm. Therefore, the separation between the 2 photons is not completely straigthforward and a quite detailed analysis of the preshower is needed.

The reconstructed cluster in the calorimeter is used to define the region to investigate in the preshower and also to measure the \(\phi\) position in of the shower in the calorimeter ( for this.the classical S shape from the finite pad granularity has been unfolded. In an accordion calorimeter the \(\phi\) direction will be measured without this problem). Both layers of the preshower are then examined. In each layer at most one cluster should be reconstructed, a cluster being defined from a local maximum in the strip energies. with more than 5 \(\gamma\) MIPS in order to reduce the influence of the pile-up and of the electronic noise. The shape of the preshower cluster sould also be consistent with the shape of an isolated photon cluster. For this the width of the cluster and the ratio between the two most energetic strips and the total cluster energy are used in both preshower layers. After these cuts, the rejections obtained are shown in Fig.15 as a function of the strip transverse dimension.for \(\pi\) 0 of 50 GeV Pt (for 90% efficiency on single \(\gamma\) ). The value of = 2.7 obtained at this level is in agreement with RD3 test beam results (which give R = 2.8 [8] against all \(\pi\) 0).

This rejection is limited by the probability conversion in the first preshower layer ( the probability to have both \(\gamma\) from a \(\pi\) 0 converted in the first layer is = 0.64 ). Therefore, to improve the rejection.one needs to have some tools against \(\pi\) 0 with only one converted photon. For this, the position matching between the calorimeter and the preshower is used in the \(\phi\) direction (in the \(\eta\) direction this matching can not be done easely because of the effect of the vertex spread which is of the same size than the separation between 2 photons from a 50 GeV \(\pi\) 0, eventually it may be possible to have some rejection at the event level.and not at the jet level, by requiring the 2 vertex positions measured by the 2 photons candidates to be consistent, but this is not used here). Figure 16 shows the distributions of the \(\phi\) matching between the calorimeter and the preshower for isolated \(\gamma\) and for the \(\pi\) 0 fulfilling the cuts on the cluster shape in the preshower.

The final results obtained after applying a matching between the calorimeter and the preshower are shown in Figure 17 as a function of the granularity ( for 90% efficiency). The cut on \(\phi\)(PS) - \(\phi\)(calc) is 2 to 3 mrad depending on the granularity. The rejection is significantly larger than 3 ( 3.6 \(\pm\) 0.3 ) for strips transverse size smaller than 4mm (at 50 GeV). To obtain some rejection up to 75 GeV,4mm is probably a little bit to large and = 3 mm seems adequate.(see Fig 17b) : A rejection of = 2.5 is obtained at Pt=75 GeV with 3mm strips width.

Concerning the positions of the 2 active layers of the preshower, it can be seen that the rejection given by the first layer only (without matching with the calorimeter) is 1.70+0.10 ( at 50 GeV) while the second layer gives 1.85+0.10. This difference is in fact smaller than what can be expected from the difference of the conversion probabilities ( naively a factor = 0.8 is expected) because the shower size is smaller in the first sampling and therefore 2 converted photons are a little more easy to separate in the first sampling. Of course after applying the \(\phi\) matching the rejection of the first sampling is significantly improved and is now = 2.25. (It should be noticed that the values given for the 2 layers are obviously not independants). Therefore only 3 very small improvement is expected if both layers are after 3 X0.

P.AGE 3

The influence of the electronic noise and of the pile-up has been estimated assuming an electonic noise of = 0.3 MIP per strip. The minimum bias events used in the pile-up computation have been generated in DICE by M.Nessi.The energy deposition from Minimum Bias events has been superimposed to single photon events assuming a luminosity of 1.6 10**34 cm-2s-1 and a shaping tune in the preshower of = 50 ns (for the response to a triangle). The effect depends on the strip length and the resulting inefficiency is smaller than 5% for strip length up to = 10 cm.

All the values given below are for photons not converted in the inner detector. For the photons converted in the inner detector ( = 10% of the events ) the efficiency of the preshower cuts is smaller ( = 35 = 10 % after all cuts) because the 2 electrons are separated by the magnetic field. ( after 30 cm in the field. 2 electrons from a symetric conversion of a 50 GeV photon are separated by = 7mm and therefore these events are similar to \(\pi\) 0 events) Probably, these converted photons will have to be removed to reject the electrons ( see section 3). This will give another 10 % inefficiency and will decrease the signal significance by 10 %. This number corresponds to the tracking simulated here at \(\eta\) = 0, which gives = 15 % of X0. (In the EAGLEB tracking, there is up to 35 % of X0 at \(\eta\) = 1.5 and therefore this problem can be very important : either the efficiency is reduced by = 30 % or the tracking should be able to separate converted photon from \(\pi\) 0 with a very high efficiency to reject electrons. in a high luminosity environment.

6) UPDATE ON THE IMPACT ON THE MSSM

A general overview of the search for the Higgses bosons of the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) at LHC can be found in [9]. The properties of the MSSM will not be repeated here. Let us just recall that in this model 5 fields are physical (2 scalars h and H. 1 pseudoscalar A. 2 charged H = ) and that 2 parameters are sufficient to describe the model ( M(A) and tan ( \(\beta\) ) for exemple). Because of radiative corrections, M(top) plays also a significant role and in the following M(top)=140 GeV is assumed. All the mass relations, cross-sections and BR can be found in [9]. In the following, we will update the capabilities of the photons channel in this model. A complete experimental study of the Higgs sector of the MSSM has also to include H+ search (in top decay see [10]), A.H -> taus search and 4 lepton channel.

The parameter space which can be investigated with h -> y decays is shown in Figure 18. The H -> y capabilities are also shown.The cross-sections used here ( taken from [9]) include the QCD corrections of [1].

CONCLUSIONS

With the various points discussed in this addendum, the conclusions of the note are mainly reinforced. Thanks to the cross-section increase.the statistical significance of H -> y has even increased.The importance of the End-Caps for this channel is probably not crucial but should not be neglected.The tracking impact on the photon detection is also important. because of the backgrounds involving electron misidentification. Finally, the preshower envisaged for EAGLE seems perfectly adequate to do the task of the photon identification.
