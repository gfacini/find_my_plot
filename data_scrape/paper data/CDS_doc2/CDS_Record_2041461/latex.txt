Identification of Boosted, Hadronically-Decaying \(W\) and \(Z\) Bosons in \(\sqrt{s}=13\) TeV Monte Carlo Simulations for ATLAS

The ATLAS Collaboration

###### Abstract

This document summarises Monte Carlo simulation-based studies of tagging boosted, hadronically-decaying \(W\) and \(Z\) bosons at a centre-of-mass energy of \(\sqrt{s}=13\) TeV. The studies presented here are based indirectly on a large body of work carried out in both real and simulated data from Run 1, and thoroughly re-evaluated and extended in simulated data at \(\sqrt{s}=13\) TeV. The selected baseline strategy for tagging vector bosons in Run 2 is to use jets reconstructed with the anti-\(k_{t}\), \(R=1.0\) algorithm and then trimmed with a subjet radius of \(R_{\rm subjet}=0.2\) and a minimum transverse momentum fraction of \(f_{\rm cut}=5\%\). A combination of transverse momenta - dependent cuts on the calibrated, trimmed jet mass and the energy correlation ratio \(D_{2}^{(\beta=1)}\) is then used to separate jets coming from hadronic decays of \(W\) and \(Z\) bosons from a multijet background. Working points for efficiency and background rejection in the hypothetical \(W^{\prime}\to WZ\to jjj\) final state event topology are provided, along with systematic uncertainties on the tagging efficiency, and on the mass and \(D_{2}^{(\beta=1)}\) variables themselves. This latter provision allows physics analyses to use these variables independently if their analysis requires it. These provisions are valid for jets with transverse momenta \(p_{\rm T}>200\) GeV and pseudorapidity \(|\eta|<2.0\).

## 1 Introduction

Massive particles produced with high transverse momenta, \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\), are _boosted_: the angular separation of the decay products is approximately \(R\sim 2M/p_{\mathrm{T}}\), where \(M\) and \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) are the mass and transverse momentum of the boosted, massive particle. This boost makes it possible to reconstruct the entire hadronic decay in a single jet, referred to here as \(W\)- and \(Z\)-jets.

There are strong motivations to have a well-understood method for tagging boosted vector bosons in early Run 2 data. The benefits of using a simple and well-understood tagger are balanced by the potential improvements from using the state-of-the art techniques in an area of study that has seen rapid developments over the years since the first Run 1 data. The studies undertaken with Run 1 data and Monte Carlo (MC) simulations, presented in Ref. [1], were extended to explore the relative efficiencies and background rejections of \(\sim 500\) variations on the pruning [2, 3], trimming [4] and split-filtering [5] techniques that have been used in ATLAS physics analyses. The full extent of those studies is documented in Ref. [6]. The preliminary conclusions of the Run 1 studies provide a subset of jet grooming algorithm configurations and substructure variables found to be efficient at identifying \(W\)-jets (from both exotic high-mass resonances and Standard Model \(t\bar{t}\) production) whilst rejecting multijet and combinatorial backgrounds.

In the studies presented here, four selected grooming algorithms and three substructure variables are tested for tagging both \(W\)-jets and \(Z\)-jets with \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) up to 2 \(\mathrm{\,Te\kern-1.0ptV}\)  using \(\sqrt{s}=13\) \(\mathrm{\,Te\kern-1.0ptV}\) simulated samples with Run 2 conditions. The ATLAS detector and the simulated MC samples are described in Sec. 2 and Sec. 3 respectively.

Jets are reconstructed and groomed as described in Sec. 4. The smallest windows containing 68% of the groomed signal jet mass distributions are identified for each of the four grooming algorithms under study. The signal efficiency at this preliminary step, using the groomed mass only, is denoted \(\epsilon_{W}^{\mathrm{G}}=68\%\), where the superscript G indicates 'Grooming'. The multijet background efficiency at this point is denoted \(\epsilon_{\mathrm{QCD}}^{\mathrm{G}}\). Signal efficiencies at 'Medium' (50%) and 'Tight' (25%) working points are then obtained by combining each of the four mass windows with selections on the three considered substructure variables. The signal efficiency at this second stage is denoted \(\epsilon_{W}^{\mathrm{G\&T}}\), where the superscript G&T is used to identify the efficiency after Grooming & Tagging. The pairwise mass windows and substructure variable selection cuts are then applied to the multijet background samples, and the background efficiencies \(\epsilon_{\mathrm{QCD}}^{\mathrm{G\&T}}\) for the 'Medium' and 'Tight' working points are compared in Sec. 5. The effects of additional proton-proton interactions in the same or adjacent bunch crossings, pileup, are also discussed in this section.

For the most promising algorithm, jet mass and energy calibrations are applied as detailed in Sec. 6 and systematic uncertainties are derived for the best-performing pairwise combination, given in Sec. 7. The conclusions are presented in Sec. 8.

## 2 The ATLAS Detector

The ATLAS experiment [7] at the LHC is a multi-purpose particle detector with a forward-backward symmetric cylindrical geometry and a near \(4\pi\) coverage in solid angle1. It consists of an inner trackingdetector (ID) residing in a 2 T axial magnetic field provided by a superconducting solenoid, surrounded by electromagnetic and hadronic calorimetry, and a muon spectrometer. The ID covers the pseudorapidity range \(|\eta|<2.5\), and consists of a silicon pixel detector, a silicon micro-strip detector (SCT) and a transition radiation tracker (TRT) for \(|\eta|<2.0\). During the first LHC long shutdown, a new tracking layer, known as the Insertable B-Layer (IBL) [8], was added close to the beam pipe.

Footnote 1: The CMS experiment uses a \(\Delta R\equiv\sqrt{\Delta\eta^{2}+\Delta\phi^{2}}\).

The calorimeter system covers the range \(|\eta|<4.9\). Within the region \(|\eta|<3.2\), electromagnetic calorimetry is provided by barrel and endcap high-granularity lead/liquid-argon (LAr) electromagnetic calorimeters, with an additional thin LAr presampler covering \(|\eta|<1.8\), to correct for energy loss in material upstream of the calorimeters. For the jets measured in this region, the transverse granularity ranges from \(0.003\times 0.1\) to \(0.1\times 0.1\) in \(\Delta\eta\times\Delta\phi\), depending on depth segment and pseudorapidity. Hadronic calorimetry is provided by the steel/scintillating-tile calorimeter, segmented into three barrel structures within \(|\eta|<1.7\), and two copper/LAr hadronic endcap calorimeters. This system enables measurements of the shower energy deposition in three depth segments at a transverse granularity of typically \(0.1\times 0.1\). The solid angle coverage is completed with forward copper/LAr and tungsten/LAr calorimeter modules optimised for electromagnetic and hadronic measurements respectively.

The muon spectrometer (MS) surrounds the calorimeters. It consists of three large superconducting air-core toroid magnets, precision tracking chambers providing accurate muon tracking out to \(|\eta|=2.7\), and additional detectors for triggering in the region \(|\eta|<2.4\). Events are selected in ATLAS with a two level trigger system consisting of a hardware-based Level 1 (L1), as well as software-based higher-level trigger [9].

## 3 Monte Carlo Simulations and ATLAS Detector Simulation

The signal \(W\)-jets and \(Z\)-jets are taken from the hypothetical process \(W^{\prime}\to WZ\), simulated using the Pythia[10] (8.186) generator. The A14 [11] tune is used together with the NNPDF2.3LO PDF set [12]. The EvtGen (1.2.0) program [13] is used for properties of the bottom and charm hadron decays. This process is produced with different \(W^{\prime}\) resonance masses (400 - 5 ) to ensure the \(W\)- and \(Z\)-jet tagging efficiencies can be calculated for jets with \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) up to 2 with a small (non-dominant) statistical uncertainty. The samples have the fully-hadronic decay modes: \(W^{\prime}\to WZ\to jjjj\), resulting in both a \(W\)-jet and a \(Z\)-jet in the final state. The simulated signal samples are combined and weighted such that the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) distribution of the leading (highest \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\)) jet in the combined signal samples matches that of the background sample to remove any bias.

The background sample consists of high-\(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) multijets initiated by light quarks and gluons, simulated using exactly the same setup as the signal samples, and also produced as a set of samples. Eight samples in total are produced according to the leading jet \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\), four of which are used in this analysis to cover the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) range 200 - 2000. The samples are combined with event weights determined by their relative cross-sections to produce the smoothly falling \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) distribution predicted by Pythia.

Generated events are passed through a Geant4-based [14; 15] simulation of the ATLAS detector. The nominal samples simulate collisions with 50ns bunch-spacing and use the FTFP_BERT physics list (the FriTioF string model [16] with Precompound is used for hadrons with \(E>4\) and the BERTini cascade [17] for hadrons with \(E<10\). The state-of-the-art topoclustering (see Sec. 4) used in Run2 includes an adjustment that prevents the local hadronic calibration from giving large weights to cells in the presampler. This has the desirable effect of reducing the contribution to topoclusters' energy from pileup. Calorimeter noise thresholds used in the simulation are optimised for 2015 pileup levels. The nominal sample uses 4 LAr sampling points in the energy reconstruction.

Variations in the detector conditions are simulated in order to take into account the limited knowledge of the Run 2 detector performance:

**Noise Thr.Up / Noise Thr.Down**: During reconstruction, the noise thresholds are shifted upwards and downwards by a fraction that reproduces the approximate size of the difference in thresholds between Run 1 and Run 2 and is also consistent with the discrepancy observed in data and MC simulations in 2012 data.
**50ns vs 25ns**: The bunch spacing conditions are varied.
**Run 1 Topo**: The topoclustering procedure used in Run 1 is adopted in place of the new method used for the nominal samples.
**Run 1 LAr**: These samples reproduce the LAr conditions of 2012 data-taking, using 5 LAr sampling points for the energy reconstruction.

Several additional variations are considered for jets in the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) range above 1, where there is a paucity of jets in Run 1 data, resulting in a feeble understanding of the jet \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) and mass scales. These variations are on the models used to describe the simulation of intranuclear and low energy processes within the detector materials. All except QGSP_BIC are based on the nominal physics list, FTFP:

**FTFP_BIC**: The Binary Intranuclear Cascade [18] is used for hadrons with \(E<10\) (as opposed to the Bertini cascade).
**QGSP_BIC**: The Quark Gluon String model [19] (as opposed to the FriTioF string model) is used for hadrons with \(E>4\) and the Binary Intranuclear Cascade is used for hadrons with \(E<10\).
**Rescat.**: The same physics list as for the nominal sample (FTFP_BERT), but with high-energy re-scattering simulated with the Binary Intranuclear Cascade.
**CHIPSxs**: Nuclear capture of negatively charged particles and neutrons at rest is handled using the Chiral Invariant Phase Space model [20]. Different inelastic hadron-nucleus cross sections are used. Pions, protons and neutrons use the CHIPS cross section instead of that provided by Barashenkov-Glauber-Gribov.
**Low-E n**: Uses a potentially more accurate neutron capture process and inelastic neutron-nucleus cross section below 20 (based on NeutronXS, a fast parameterisation of neutronHP).
**No Diffrac.**: Both projectile and target diffraction are switched off.
**New Elas.**: Newer elastic cross sections and final-state models are used.

All MC simulation samples are produced with additional pileup, modelled by overlaying simulated hits from events with exactly one inelastic collision per bunch crossing, with hits from minimum-bias events that are produced with Pythia (8.160) using the A2M tune [21] and the MSTW2008LO [22] PDF set.

## 4 Jet Reconstruction and Grooming

Calorimeter jets are reconstructed from three-dimensional topological clusters [23] which have been calibrated using the Local Cluster Weighting (LCW) scheme [24; 25]. Truth jets are built from generated particles that have a lifetime longer than 10 ps, excluding muons and neutrinos. Jets are reconstructed using the C/A algorithm [26] and the anti-\(k_{t}\) algorithm [27]. The \(k_{t}\)[28; 29] algorithm is also used by the jet trimming algorithm to reconstruct subjets.

To account for correlations between the \(W/Z\) boson \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) and the jet substructure features, events are categorised by the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) of the leading ungroomed jet reconstructed with the Cambridge-Aachen [26] (C/A) algorithm with distance parameter \(R=1.2\), using stable particles as inputs. Only events with a C/A, \(R=1.2\) jet with \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\), denoted as \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{Truth}}\), in the ranges [200, 350], [350, 500], [500, 1000], [1000, 1500], and [1500, 2000] GeV and with pseudorapitdity \(|\eta^{\mathrm{Truth}}|<2.0\) are considered in the following studies. This ungroomed large-\(R\) truth jet is a rough proxy for the hadronically-decaying \(W\) or \(Z\) boson. It is used to ensure that the performance for each of the grooming algorithms is compared in the same regions of phase space without migrations due to different reconstructed jet \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\).

Jets are groomed using each of the four configurations deemed promising based on previous studies [6; 30]. These configurations and the acronyms used to identify them are summarised here:

1. **R2**: anti-\(k_{t}\), \(R=1.0\), trimmed with \(R_{\mathrm{subjet}}=0.2,f_{\mathrm{cut}}=5\%\) - This trimming configuration has a slightly smaller subjet radius: \(R_{\mathrm{subjet}}=0.2\) than the \(R_{\mathrm{subjet}}=0.3\) trimming configuration favoured in previous ATLAS studies such as Ref. [31], and uses the same \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) fraction \(f_{\mathrm{cut}}=\)5%.
2. **P515**: C/A, \(R=1.0\), pruned with \(z_{\mathrm{cut}}=15\%,R_{\mathrm{cut}}=\frac{1}{2}\) - This pruning configuration was found in Ref. [6] to be particularly good for tagging \(W\)-jets (and by equivalence, \(Z\)-jets) in the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\sim 500\) GeV region. It is similar to the algorithm favoured by CMS in Run 1 [32], using the same distance requirement of \(R_{\mathrm{cut}}=\frac{1}{2}\) (referred to by CMS as \(D_{\mathrm{cut}}\)) and a slightly harder momentum requirement of \(z_{\mathrm{cut}}=\)15% as opposed to the \(z_{\mathrm{cut}}=\)10% favoured by CMS (who also prefer an initial radius of \(R=0.8\)).
3. **Y15**: C/A, \(R=1.2\) split-filtered with \(R_{\mathrm{subjet}}=0.3,y_{\mathrm{cut}}>15\%\) - The best-performing flavour of split-filtering from the extensive Run 1 studies [6] uses a relatively hard momentum balance cut of \(\sqrt{y_{12}}=\)15% (compared to the 9% benchmark from Ref. [5]) and a fixed subjet radius \(R_{\mathrm{subjet}}=\)0.3. The mass-drop requirement \(\mu_{\mathrm{frac}}\) is no longer implemented in any split-filtering configurations, as it was shown in Ref. [6] to be redundant.
4. **Y4**: C/A, \(R=1.2\) split-filtered with \(R_{\mathrm{subjet}}=0.3,y_{\mathrm{cut}}>4\%\) - This split-filtering configuration was optimised specifically for a Run 1 search for hadronically-decaying exotic diboson resonances [30].

Only the leading reconstructed groomed jet is considered to optimise the tagging of boosted \(W\) and \(Z\) bosons. The mass distributions of the leading jets for the four grooming configurations are shown in Fig. 1 for the ranges \(200<p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{Truth}}<350\) GeV and \(1500<p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{Truth}}<2000\) GeV. No jet-level calibrations are applied at this stage. The shapes of the jet mass distributions have a strong dependence on \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) for the R2 and P515 algorithms, particularly in the case of the multijet background. The Y15 algorithm produces jets with a slightly more stable multijet mass distribution across the full range of \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) explored in this study. The \(W\)- and \(Z\)-jet signal mass distributions are quite similar for Y4 and Y15, but the multijet distribution for the Y4 algorithm (with the looser momentum balance requirement) has a maximum close to the signal mass distribution.

Figure 1: The uncalibrated jet mass distributions for \(W\)-jets (blue circles), \(Z\)-jets (black triangles) and background (red squares) with four different grooming configurations for leading reconstructed jets. Events are categorised by the leading ungroomed C/A truth jet with \(|\eta|^{\rm Truth}<2.0\) and \(200<p_{\rm T}^{\rm Truth}<350\) GeV (filled markers) and \(1500<p_{\rm T}^{\rm Truth}<2000\) GeV (open markers). The distributions are truncated at 200 GeV to focus on the peaks of the signal distributions; for background jets in the range \(1500<p_{\rm T}^{\rm Truth}<2000\) GeV there is a high mass tail that extends beyond 1 TeV.

The pileup-dependence of the reconstructed groomed jet mass is shown in Fig. 2 for \(W\)-jets and multijet background. The behaviour for \(Z\)-jets (not shown) is similar (to within a fraction of a percent) to that observed for \(W\)-jets. It is possible to remove approximately all pileup effects from the average of the jet mass, \(\langle M\rangle\), using the R2 algorithm, with Y15 also performing very well. These observations apply to all the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) ranges studied here. The \(\langle M\rangle\) increases with \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{truth}}\); multijet background jets in events with \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{Truth}}>1\) TeV exhibit a high mass tail that can extend to \(M>1\) TeV.

## 5 Tagging Efficiencies

Three substructure variables have been identified in previous studies [6] as being particularly good at tagging \(W\)-jets when combined with a groomed jet mass window:

Figure 2: The pileup dependence of the mean jet mass \(\langle M\rangle\) for groomed signal \(W\)-jets (blue circles) and background jet (red squares) for two leading ungroomed C/A \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{Truth}}\) ranges. The performance of the groomers in terms of removing the NPV-dependence for \(Z\)-jets is very similar to that for \(W\)-jets, so is not shown here for clarity.

1. \(\mathbf{C_{2}}\)[33]: A ratio of two- and three-point energy correlation functions, which are sums over the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\)-weighted angular separations of the pairwise and tripletwise combinations of jet constituents.
2. \(\mathbf{D_{2}}\)[34; 35]: A variation on the ratio of energy correlations which optimises the separation between one-prong and two-prong decays, in analytical terms.
3. \(\mathbf{\tau_{21}}\)[36; 37]: The N-subjettiness ratio with the 'winner take all' method of defining internal axes.

In previous studies the \(C_{2}\) and \(D_{2}\) variables have been referred to as \(C_{2}^{(\beta=1)}\) and \(D_{2}^{(\beta=1)}\), where \(\beta\) is the exponent used in the ratio. This superscript is removed for simplicity in these studies, where \(\beta=1\) is used consistently. The N-subjettiness ratio with the 'winner take all' method was previously denoted as \(\tau_{21}^{\mathrm{vta}}\) but will be referred to as \(\tau_{21}\) in the following.

No calibrations are derived for the substructure variables, which are calculated from the groomed jets' constituents.

The multijet background rejections achievable for the 'Medium' signal efficiency working points \(\epsilon_{W}^{\mathrm{G\&T}}=50\%\) and \(\epsilon_{Z}^{\mathrm{G\&T}}=50\%\) are shown in Fig. 3 and Fig. 4 for the leading reconstructed jets in events with \(200<p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{T\&TH}}<350\,\mathrm{GeV}\) and \(1500<p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{T\&TH}}<2000\,\mathrm{GeV}\). Also shown are the background rejections achievable at the 'Medium' working point when requiring a narrower mass window such that \(\epsilon_{W}^{\mathrm{G}}=50\%\) or \(\epsilon_{Z}^{\mathrm{G}}=50\%\). In events with lower \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{T\&TH}}\) (Fig. 3) the mass-only requirement yields higher background rejection power for \(Z\)-jets than for \(W\)-jets. This is a result of the \(Z\) boson mass being \(\sim 10\,\mathrm{GeV}\) higher than the \(W\) boson mass, and therefore better separated from the multijet background. Conversely, all of the pairwise combinations result in higher background rejection power for \(W\)-jets than for \(Z\)-jets. This behaviour is understood with reference to Fig. 1 to come from the broader \(Z\)-jet mass distribution rather than from differences in the distributions of the substructure variables. The window needed for \(\epsilon_{Z}^{\mathrm{G}}=68\%\) is thus wider than for \(\epsilon_{W}^{\mathrm{G}}=68\%\), and due to its juxtaposition with the falling background this means a slightly lower background rejection for \(Z\)-jets than \(W\)-jets in this window, despite the opposite being true in the window providing \(\epsilon_{W/Z}^{\mathrm{G}}=50\%\).

The efficiency versus rejection curves for \(W\)-jets versus multijets are shown for the three pairwise groomed mass and substructure combinations for each grooming algorithm in Fig. 5 and Fig. 6 for the leading reconstructed jet in events with \(200<p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{T\&TH}}<350\,\mathrm{GeV}\) and \(1500<p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{T\&TH}}<2000\,\mathrm{GeV}\). The corresponding curves for \(Z\)-jets (not shown) display much the same characteristics.

The best combinations in terms of the background rejections are given in Tab. 1, for both the 'Medium' \(\epsilon_{W/Z}^{\mathrm{G\&T}}=50\%\) and 'Tight' \(\epsilon_{W/Z}^{\mathrm{G\&T}}=25\%\) working points. There are a few combinations that perform particularly well in terms of background rejection, namely P515 and R2 with \(C_{2}\) and \(D_{2}\).

The combination of these preliminary results on the pileup dependence of the grooming algorithms (Fig. 2) and background rejection (Tab. 1) indicate the R2 \(D_{2}\) combination as the best option for a baseline Run 2 boson tagger.

## 6 Calibrations and Optimisation of R2 \(\mathbf{D_{2}}\)

The R2 jet energy and mass calibrations (derived for inclusive multijets as described in Ref. [38]) are tested for \(W\)-jets and \(Z\)-jets by comparing the position and width of the jet mass peaks before and after calibration. The \(W\)-jet and \(Z\)-jet mass distributions are fitted with a Gaussian function, from which the mean and standard deviation, \(\sigma\), can be extracted. Figure 7 shows the R2 \(\langle M\rangle\) as a function of R2Figure 3: Matrix showing the background rejections achievable when tagging \(W\)-jets and \(Z\)-jets with \(\epsilon_{W/Z}^{\text{G\&T}}=50\%\) for different combinations of a mass window criteria on the groomed jet and a substructure variable requirement, and for mass-only, in events with the leading ungroomed C/A jet in the range \(200<p_{\text{T}}^{\text{Truth}}<350~{}\text{GeV}\). The uncertainties are statistical errors only.

The uncertainties are statistical errors only.

before and after the calibrations are applied, along with the \(1\sigma\) and \(2\sigma\) ranges. Apart from the expected differences in the nominal \(\langle M\rangle\), the \(W\)- and \(Z\)-jets exhibit the same behaviour: rising linearly with R2 \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) before calibration, and flat afterwards.

After calibration, the \(\langle M\rangle\)\(1\sigma\) standard deviation ranges from 8 - 25 GeV. The calibrated mass window is chosen as \(\langle M\rangle\pm 15\) GeV across the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) range, resulting in \(\epsilon_{W/Z}^{\mathrm{G}}\) = 55 - 80% as opposed to the optimisation studies where a flat signal efficiency of 68% was used based on the uncalibrated jet mass. A \(\langle M\rangle\pm 15\) GeVmass window was chosen as a good compromise of the changing mass resolution over the considered \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) range. It is these calibrated mass windows that are used in combination with \(D_{2}\) for deriving the efficiencies and uncertainties in the following studies.

The \(D_{2}\) selection requirement is one-sided, with a lower boundary of zero and a maximum determined as a function of the calibrated R2 jet \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\), as shown in Fig. 8. For each range of R2 \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) (ranges are 100 GeV wide for \(p_{\mathrm{T}}<1100\) GeV, and then wider to account for the relative low number of available simulated events) the \(D_{2}\) requirements that yield the 'Medium' and 'Tight' signal efficiencies are calculated. These

The ‘Medium’ (50%) and ‘Tight’ (25%) signal efficiency working points are indicated.

measured maximum \(D_{2}\) criteria are then fitted with a second- or fourth-order polynomial depending on the chosen signal efficiency. It is this fit that is used to determine the optimal cut values as a smooth function of R2 \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\), thus removing any bin-edge effects that may result from the use of discrete cut values.

## 7 Systematic Uncertainties

For the derivation of systematic uncertainties, the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) of the truth R2 jet that is matched (within \(\Delta R<0.7\)) to the reconstructed R2 jet is used to categorise events in place of the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) of the leading ungroomed C/A truth jet, \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{truth}}\), used in the optimisation stage. This R2-trimmed truth jet \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) is denoted \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{R2-truth}}\) and the uncertainties are derived in ranges of the dimensionless ratio \(M^{\mathrm{R2-reco}}/p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{R2-reco}}\) for each \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{R2-truth}}\) range. This ratio is related to the expected \(\Delta R\) between decay products and is a good variable to test the boost of the system. In addition, for the multijet background there is a correlation between \(M^{\mathrm{R2-reco}}\) and \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{R2-reco}}\) that can be removed by using the ratio instead. For the derivation of the systematic uncertainties, all reconstructed jets in the event that are matched to a truth jet with \(200<p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{R2-truth}}<2000\) GeV are considered.

The scale uncertainties are estimated by deriving the fitted mean of the response2 for each of the different variations described in Sec. 3, and then comparing these with the nominal response obtained from the multijet sample used to calculate the background rejections in Sec. 5. Two different approaches are needed:

Footnote 2: The response of a variable \(X\) is defined on an event-by-event basis, as the ( reconstructed jet \(X\) ) / ( truth jet \(X\) ), where there is a requirement that \(\Delta R\)(truth, reco)\(<0.7\). The \(X\) response distribution is then fitted with a Gaussian function, from which the mean and ‘Root Mean Square’ standard deviation (RMS) can be extracted. These quantities provide a measure of the effects of the detector, which has the potential to cause systematic shifts (visible in the mean) or smearing (visible in the RMS). The variables considered in this study are \(D_{2}\), the calibrated mass and \(p_{\rm T}\).

For jets with \(p_{\rm T}^{\rm R2\text{-truth}}<1\) TeV:

1. The baseline systematic uncertainty on the jet mass, energy and substructure scales uses the Run 1 calorimeter / track jet double-ratios, described in Ref. [6].
2. To account for the changes to the detector with respect to Run 1, five additional detector-level variations are studied here: Noise Thr.Up, Noise Thr.Down, 50ns vs 25ns, Run 1 Topo., and Run 1 LAr.

For jets with \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{R2\text{-truth}}}>1\) TeV:

There are insufficient jets in this \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{R2\text{-truth}}}\) range from Run 1 data, so it is not possible to re-use Run 1 uncertainties. Instead, MC simulation based uncertainties are used to account for both modeling and detector effects.

1. Modeling uncertainties are considered by comparing the differences in response using the nominal samples provided by Pythia with a sample generated with HERWIG++.
2. The variations in pileup conditions (50ns vs 25ns) and noise thresholds (Noise Thr.Up, Noise Thr.Down) used for the lower \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{R2\text{-truth}}}\) jets are also used here, but the topoclustering Run 1 Topo. and energy reconstruction (Run 1 LAr) variations are not relevant here, as they are specific variations on the procedures used in the Run 1 double ratios.
3. To account for the absence of a handle on the detector's response to TeV-scale jets, seven variations specifically focused on the descriptions of intranuclear processes in the detector materials are studied.

No explicit variations on the detector geometry are included in these studies, as changes due to the new IBL have been found to have a negligible effect on the JES and JMS for anti-\(k_{t}\), \(R=0.4\) jets [38]. Previous studies showed a 1-2% effect on the jet energy and mass scale from the possible mis-modeling of the detector geometry [39].

Variations considered here that are found to have negligible effects on the reconstructed mass, \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) and \(D_{2}\) scales are as follows:

* Run 1 LAr and Run 1 Topo. : The differences in the responses when using the Run 1 strategy for energy samplings and topoclustering are negligible.
* CHIPSxs and Low-E n : These variations are focused on the lower energy processes in the detector material, and so have a negligible effect for jets in the high \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) ranges considered here, as expected.
* No Difffrac. and New Elas.: These variations are only applicable to a very small fraction of processes, and so have a negligible effect for jets in the high \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) ranges considered here, as expected.

The ratio between the nominal response and that obtained with each of the non-negligible variations is shown in different \(M^{\mathrm{R2\text{-reco}}}/p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{R2\text{-reco}}}\) ranges in Fig. 9 and Fig. 10 for the calibrated R2 jet \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) and mass and the R2\(D_{2}\). It is these ratios that provide the additional relative systematic uncertainties related to each of the variations. Also shown is the 'Total Run 2' uncertainty, which is obtained from the sum in quadrature of the non-negligible variations (three in Fig. 9 and seven in Fig. 10). This is not the final uncertainty for use in analyses; for jets with \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{R2\text{-truth}}}<1\) TeV the final uncertainty is obtained from combining the three non-negligible Run 2 uncertainties summed in quadrature with the double-ratio uncertainties from Run 1 and the statistical uncertainties; for jets with \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{R2\text{-truth}}}>1\) TeV the final uncertainty is obtained from combining the seven non-negligible Run 2 uncertainties summed in quadrature with the statistical uncertainties.

The effects of the variations on the noise thresholds (NoiseThr.Up and NoiseThr.Down) are negligible for \(D_{2}\) and are negative by a few percent for \(M\) and \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\), meaning that the mean reconstructed mass and \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) are higher with both variations than in the nominal sample. These effects are larger for the upwards variation (a higher noise threshold, meaning fewer and smaller clusters) and are more pronounced in the lower \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{R2-truth}}\) ranges.

The detector-level (NoiseThr.Up, NoiseThr.Down) uncertainties on the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) and mass for R2 jets are considerably higher than those obtained for anti-\(k_{t}\), \(R=0.4\) jets in Ref. [38]. This can be understood as having two main causes; First, the area of a jet with \(R=1.0\) is potentially more than six times the area of a jet with \(R=0.4\), resulting in a significantly higher cluster multiplicity. Second, the trimming algorithm removes subjets, not individual clusters. This means that it is not straightforward to predict the effects of variations at the cluster-level.

The effect of using 25ns bunch spacing in place of the nominal 50ns (50ns vs 25ns) is positive by a few percent for jets with \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{R2-truth}}<1\) TeV, meaning that the mean reconstructed mass is lower than in the nominal sample. For jets with \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{R2-truth}}>1\) TeV this variation is negligible.

The effects of varying the models used to describe the higher energy intranuclear process in the detector materials (FTFP_BIC, QGSP_BIC and Rescat.), applied only to jets with \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{R2-truth}}>1\) TeV, are the dominant sources of uncertainty in this region. In particular the QGSP_BIC variation results in upward response variations exceeding 5% for both mass and \(D_{2}\) in the lowest \(M^{\mathrm{R2-reco}}/p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{R2-reco}}\) bin, and within 2% in the other bins. This lowest \(M^{\mathrm{R2-reco}}/p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{R2-reco}}\) bin is the only one of relevance for signal \(W\)-jets and \(Z\)-jets in the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{R2-truth}}>1\) TeV range.

For \(200<p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{R2-truth}}<350\) GeV the \(M^{\mathrm{R2-reco}}/p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{R2-reco}}\) bins [0.2, 0.3] and [0.3, 0.4] are relevant for signal. The highest two bins in \(M^{\mathrm{R2-reco}}/p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{R2-reco}}\) for the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{R2-truth}}\) ranges considered in these studies never contain signal \(W\)-jets or \(Z\)-jets.

The differences in the \(M\), \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\), and \(D_{2}\) scales when \(\tt{Herwig++}\) in place of Pythia are generally negligible, only reaching a 1% variation in the lowest \(M^{\mathrm{R2-reco}}/p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{R2-reco}}\) for the \(D_{2}\) scale.

The uncertainties on the \(D_{2}\) substructure variable are derived with and without the requirement on the 68% jet mass window. However, only the systematic uncertainties without the mass window requirement are shown here. This choice is motivated in part by the restriction imposed on \(M^{\mathrm{R2-reco}}/p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{R2-reco}}\) (generally to a single bin) when applying a requirement on \(M^{R2-reco}\). The \(D_{2}\) uncertainties after the mass window criteria are used to derive the uncertainties on the signal efficiency as described later in this section.

The resolution, \(\sigma\), of each variable is determined as the standard deviation of a Gaussian fit to the response distribution. The relative uncertainties on these resolutions were determined in Run 1 studies [39] as approximately 20% for the jet mass and 10% for \(D_{2}\), and these values are conservatively consistent with the variations observed in these studies. An absolute resolution uncertainty of 2% is assumed for the jet \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) based on studies presented in Ref. [38].

### Systematic Uncertainties on the Signal and Background Efficiency

The uncertainty on the signal and background efficiencies from each source are determined by varying the three scales (\(p_{\mathrm{T}}\), \(M\) and \(D_{2}\)) simultaneously by their uncertainties from the corresponding source. This amounts to treating the three scales as if they are fully correlated. The impact of the resolution uncertainties is determined for each variable separately, treating them as uncorrelated. This procedure is Figure 9: The contributions to the systematic uncertainty on the calibrated R2 jet \(p_{\rm T}\) and mass, and the R2 \(D_{2}\), as a function of \(M^{\rm R2\,\rm{reco}}/p_{\rm T}^{\rm R2\,\rm{reco}}\) for the multijet samples with the three dominant standard systematic variations on the MC simulation for jets with \(200<p_{\rm T}^{\rm R2\,\rm{truth}}<350\) GeV. Each contribution is calculated from 1 - \(Var/Nom\), where \(Nom\) is the mean of the reco/truth response in the nominal sample, and \(Var\) is the same for the variation in question. Also shown is the ‘Total Run 2’ uncertainty, the meaning of which is described in the text. Variations that result in a negligible shift in response are not shown.

Each contribution is calculated from 1 - \(Var/Nom\), where \(Nom\) is the mean of the reco/truth response in the nominal sample, and \(Var\) is the same for the variation in question. Also shown is the ’Total Run 2’ uncertainty, the meaning of which is described in the text. Variations that result in a negligible shift in response are not shown.

repeated independently for each of the different sources described above, and for the double-ratio scale uncertainties from Run 1, and the resulting shifts in efficiencies are added in quadrature.

The R2\(D_{2}\) tagging efficiencies for the leading reconstructed jet versus \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) for \(W\)-jets and \(Z\)-jets provided by Pythia are shown in Fig. 11 along with the corresponding multijet background rejections. The large uncertainties on the background rejection at the tight working point are strongly dominated by the \(D_{2}\) scale uncertainty; the optimal point on the multijet \(D_{2}\) distribution for selecting signal over background happens to sit right at the top of a steeply falling distribution [6], meaning that even small variations in the value for the signal selection have large effects on the efficiency.

Also shown for the background rejection is the uncertainty band without the dominant source of uncertainty on the \(D_{2}\) scale.

## 8 Conclusions

The identification of boosted, hadronically-decaying vector bosons with Monte Carlo simulations at a centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV for ATLAS has been presented. Several combinations of jet grooming algorithms and tagging variables have been studied based on the knowledge acquired during Run 1 for jets in events with \(200<p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{Truth}}<2000\GeV\). Jets reconstructed with the anti-\(k_{t}\), \(R=1.0\) algorithm and then trimmed with a subjet radius of \(R_{\mathrm{subjet}}=0.2\) and \(f_{\mathrm{cut}}=5\%\) ('R2') have been chosen as a preliminary recommendation for Run 2 boson tagging, based on the large background rejection and small pileup dependence achievable with the R2 jet mass. A combination of the R2 jet mass and the energy correlation ratio \(D_{2}\) has been chosen to identify boosted bosons during the 2015 data taking period based on the multijet rejection power for fixed \(W/Z\)-jet signal efficiencies. Systematic uncertainties on the jet \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\), mass and \(D_{2}\) scales from a variety of sources have been determined for R2 jets in the range \(200<p_{\mathrm{T}}<2000\GeV\). These have been combined with resolution uncertainties and existing Run 1 uncertainties, and propagated through to the final signal and multijet background efficiency measurements. For a 'Medium' signal efficiency of 50% \(\pm\) 6%, a multijet background rejection of 60 \(\pm\) 20 can be achieved for R2 jets with \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) around 1 TeV. The uncertainties on the multijet background efficiency for a 'Tight' signal efficiency of 25% can be up to 40%; this large background efficiency uncertainty is driven by the \(D_{2}\) scale uncertainty. The \(D_{2}\) scale uncertainty, although modest in itself, has a dramatic effect on the multijet background efficiency for a signal efficiency of \(\epsilon_{W/Z}^{\mathrm{G\&T}}=25\%\) because of the steeply falling \(D_{2}\) distribution. To be able to use the 'Tight' working point for physics analysis, the systematic uncertainties on the \(D_{2}\) variable need to be reduced using e.g. in-situ techniques. Otherwise the usage of other tagging variables as the energy correlation variable \(C_{2}\) which showed as well promising multijet background rejections in the optimisation studies can be considered.
