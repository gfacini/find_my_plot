## 1 Introduction

This Memorandum is to summarize the current thinking on the use of krypton instead of argon in the electromagnetic calorimeter of ATLAS. First, the gain in performance for the \(H\ \rightarrow\ \gamma\gamma\) channel is discussed. Second, various technical aspects of the use of krypton are considered.

## 2 Gain in Performance

An improvement of the resolution of the electromagnetic calorimeter is _a priori_ important in view of the detection of a Higgs boson through its \(\gamma\gamma\) decay mode. This is the only decay mode that can be seen if the Higgs mass is below 120 GeV, both for the Standard Model Higgs and for most of the parameter space for the Higgs bosons of the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model.

The first possibility that has been considered is to replace, in the current design of the ATLAS barrel electromagnetic calorimeter (the 'Accordiou' calorimeter), the liquid argon by liquid krypton, without any modifications to the mechanics of the calorimeter stack. The sensitive medium which (at \(\eta\) = 0) is 2 X\({}_{0}\) of liquid argon would then be 5.7 X\({}_{0}\) of liquid krypton. The electromagnetic calorimeter would then have a depth of 28.2 X\({}_{0}\) instead of 24.5 X\({}_{0}\) (the 3 X\({}_{0}\) of the preshower detector have to be added in both cases). The gain in resolution of such a solution is small, about 10 % [1, 2, 3].

A more interesting possibility consists in changing the thickness of the absorber plates. Thanks to the shorter radiation length of the liquid krypton relative to the liquid argon. this can be done while keeping constant the overall dimensions and the number of absorber plates of the electromagnetic calorimeter (thus at no change of cost of the mechanics). Instead of having 1.8 mm lead plates (at \(\eta\) = 0) with a 0.2 mm stainless steel clad, one could then have lead plates of 1.4 mm, with a liquid gap correspondingly larger (2 \(\times\) 2.2 mm instead of 2 \(\times\) 2 mm).

Preliminary simulations indicate [1], in agreement with recent tests performed by the GEM Collaboration, that the current 'Accordion' sampling term of \(\frac{10\%}{\sqrt{E}}\) would be reduced to \(\frac{5\%}{\sqrt{E}}\). A calorimeter optimized in this way for liquid krypton would have, if filled with liquid argon instead, a resolution of typically \(\frac{8.5\%}{\sqrt{E}}\), but \(3.7\)X\({}_{0}\) less depth.

Figure 1 shows, as a function of the rapidity, the photon energy resolution for a transverse energy of 60 GeV. The full and dashed curves are for liquid argon (1% and 0.6% constant term respectively) and the dotted curve for liquid krypton in the barrel calorimeter (0.6% constant term). The end-cap is assumed to be filled with argon in both cases. The resolution is the quadratic sum of the sampling term, the constant term, the term due to the material in front of the calorimeter (empirically parametrized as \(\frac{3\%}{\sqrt{E}}\)) and the pile-up plus electronic noise, optimised for a luminosity of \(10^{34}\) cm\({}^{-2}\)s\({}^{-1}\).

The ATLAS Collaboration now aims at a better constant term than the 1% quoted in its Letter of Intent. On the basis of test beam measurements with the RD3 'Accordion' prototype, a constant term of 0.6% is being used in the simulation. This improvement is particularly relevant for the better energy resolution of liquid krypton.

The electronic noise is taken to be 60% smaller for krypton than for argon, in accordance with measurements performed by the GEM Collaboration with Si-JFET preamplifiers. The improvement in signal-to-noise ratio results from the larger \(dE/dx\) and the better noise performance at \(120^{8}K\) for the Si-JFET preamplifiers, which largely outweigh the slower (20% or so) drift speed.

From Fig. 1 one concludes that the gain in energy resolution in the barrel region (\(|\eta|<1.42\)) is significant. The \(\gamma\gamma\)-mass resolution is shown in Fig. 2 (top for liquid krypton, bottom for liquid argon) for the events selected like in the ATLAS Letter of Intent: one \(\gamma\) in the barrel and the other one either in the barrel or in the end-cap (\(1.62<|\eta|<2.5\)). The resolutions given include the \(\gamma\) angular resolution as measured in the test beam with the RD3 calorimeter and presllower detector. This contribution degrades the \(\gamma\gamma\)-mass resolution by a small amount (7% in the krypton case, 5% in the argon case).

The Higgs mass resolutions are 1.03 GeV for krypton and 1.22 GeV for argon, both for \(m_{H}=110\) GeV and for a constant term of 0.6%. For a liquid argon calorimeter and a constant term of 1% the corresponding mass resolution is 1.38 GeV.

## 3 Technical Aspects

In this section, some technical difficulties inherent to the use of liquid krypton instead of liquid argon are addressed.

### Material compatibility

The boiling point of liquid krypton is 120\({}^{\circ}\)K instead of 87\({}^{\circ}\)K for liquid argon (at atmospheric pressure). Given this relatively small difference, one would not expect many materials to outgas more in krypton than in argon. Therefore, material compatibility is

expected to be very similar in liquid krypton and in liquid argon. This was confirmed both by the KEDR and NA48 experiments, which found no problem in using G10, Teflon, Kapton, and PVC cables in liquid krypton.

However, one should note that long electron lifetimes were found harder to achieve with krypton than with argon calorimeters. An analysis of the problems indicated that the pollution sources were either air leaks or water outgassing in krypton due to the presence of foam [4].

### Purification

For the KEDR detector, no purification was performed before liquefaction, as the krypton used for this detector contained less than \(10^{-1}\) ppm of electronegative impurities. (In the NA48 and GEM tests, the krypton was purified with OXISORB before liquefaction.)

In ATLAS, the electromagnetic calorimeter which uses a shaping of 20 ns does not require ultra-purity of the liquid. However, since the purity of krypton might vary from production to production, it would certainly be considered as a safe measure to be able to purify the krypton in order to have a clean, homogeneous liquid. The practical problems of doing this for an underground experiment involving large volumes of liquid should not be underestimated. It should be noted that the ATLAS Collaboration plans to have, even for liquid argon, an underground storage capable of housing the whole liquid volume of the calorimeter.

### Closed liquid krypton system?

In general a cryogenic system contains both safety valves and rupture disks in order to release any excessive pre- sure due to a failure of the cooling system. Due to the high cost of krypton, the necessity and implications of using a closed system for the liquid/gas should be assessed.

### Cooling

Like for argon, the difference between the boiling point and the freezing point is rather small (5 degrees), which puts strong requirements on the capabilities of the cooling system.

A further difficulty for krypton results from the fact that liquid nitrogen, at a pressure close to 1 atm, is too cold as a cooling medium. As a consequence the liquid krypton would freeze around the cooling loop, which is not desirable. To achieve an adequate temperature for cooling of liquid krypton requires a liquid nitrogen pressure of typically 25 bars. As a consequence, from the beginning, the cooling system must be designed to withstand, including the necessary safety factor, a pressure of typically 40 bars.

### Activation of \({}^{84}\)Kr

Due to a small proportion of the \({}^{85}\)Kr-isotope (\(\beta\)-emitter, 10.7 years period) natural krypton is slightly radioactive. KEDR quotes 300 Becquerel per cm\({}^{3}\). Even for large volumes, this level of radioactivity (less than 1 ('urie for 100 m\({}^{3}\)) does not seem to raise a safety problem. The associated noise is negligible for the fast shapings adopted in LHC' calorimetry.

Activation of liquid argon (\({}^{41}Ar\) produced by thermal neutrons) has been studied in detail for the ATLAS LoI, and found to be well compatible with safety rules. There was not enough time to make an analogous study for liquid krypton. However, from the smaller values of the cross-sections for \({}^{85}Kr\) and \({}^{85m}Kr\) activation by neutron capture, one can convince oneself that liquid krypton would be even less of a problem.

### Electronics

The better noise figure in the liquid krypton case would call for a somewhat larger dynamic range. In practice, the 16 bits already foreseen for the liquid argon case may be sufficient.

### Conclusions on technical aspects

The use of liquid krypton will create practical difficulties compared to liquid argon, and will certainly require a larger investment. Even in case one would use liquid argon in a first stage and liquid krypton later, investments for cooling and purification must be considered right from the beginning in the design of the cryogenics.

The amount of liquid krypton to be used depends on how much of the ATLAS calorimetry will be done using liquid calorimetry. The minimum is 30 m\({}^{3}\) for the barrel electromagnetic part.

For such a volume, the total cost depends on negotiations with various sources of procurements. For smaller volumes, a typical cost in Western Europe is 0.3 to 0.4 MCHF per m\({}^{3}\).

## 4 Concluding remarks

The improvement of the sampling term in the energy resolution of the electromagnetic calorimeter by the use of liquid krypton rather than liquid argon _a priori_ looks like an interesting opportunity.

The potential gain in resolution of about 30% implies also the necessity to reach a smaller constant term, well below 1%, than formerly anticipated. While not impossible, this may be hard to achieve in a large calorimeter.

As compared to liquid argon further technical challenges in the areas of cryogenics and purification would have to be mastered for such a calorimeter. They will introduce a larger risk factor for the operation than in the case of liquid argon.

Finally, an important cost increase would have to be expected as compared to the liquid argon calorimetry, thus counteracting the effort of the ATLAS (Collaboration to face its financial constraints by staging and down-grading [5].

Given all these considerations the ATLAS (Collaboration maintains the liquid argon technology as baseline for its electromagnetic calorimetry in stage-1. Further conceptual studies are pursued to evaluate the implications of an electromagnetic calorimeter design which would optimize a possible later upgrade to liquid krypton operation.
