Abstract

An assembly technique is described which uses dynamically aligned "comb bridges" to assemble, in a continuos operation, the bottom multilayer, the spacer structure with its external alignment platforms, and the top multilayer.

## 1 The Basic Idea

As first reported at the Boston Muon Collaboration meeting on Oct. 21, 94, the assembly station, consisting of a table and a rack of comb bridges, transports and positions the tubes. The table, shown in Fig. 1, supports a set of translation stages, a source plate and a detector plate, which together set up an array of calibrated light beams corresponding to the pattern of the two multilayers of the MDT chambers.

A Mylar or aluminum foil is laid on top of the table. The rack of comb bridges, similar to those used in the NIKHEF design are shown in Fig. 2, grab, from above, a complete layer of tubes "by suction", then each bridge is set onto its pair of translation stages and is aligned to the laser beams by means of its Si-strip or other types of transparent detectors. The tubes are then epoxied to the aluminum foil and to each other and are held in this position until the epoxy has sufficiently hardened. This is repeated for layers two and three. Then the spacer structure, with its support brackets, is epoxied on top, the alignment platforms are set and finally, the upper multilayer is assembled.

## 2 The Assembly Table

The table corresponds in size to the largest chambers to be assembled and is shown in Fig. 1. In this procedure the tubes are not aligned to the table surface but held, from above, in their precise, desired position, therefore, the flatness of the table top is not crucial, as epoxy will make up the difference. The table could be made of concrete and only has to be stable over the time necessary to assemble one chamber. Some details of a possible implementation are shown in Fig. 3. A 6 mm aluminum plate is bolted to the table and shimmed to 0.5 mm flatness. The plate is fitted with tapped mounting holes for the assembly components and pumping-holes to hold down the aluminum or Mylar foil. This foil is not part of the present chamber specification, but, although not necessary, facilitates this assembly procedure. The foil is only necessary under the comb bridges to provide an "epoxy floor" for the first layer, so it could be replaced with a strip a few centimeters wide. Further, in this position the foil will keep, after assembly, the tubes in the designed position. However, a protective skin over the full outside of the chamber would give some means of protection to the delicate tubes. The trench, shown at the near end of the end of the table top, is to move an x-ray detector underneath the lower multilayer to verify the wire position. (A note on "Verification of Wire Position in MDT Chambers by X-ray Topography " is in preparation.)

Up to five pairs of translation stages are mounted, aligned with a micro radian level, onto two strip-plates as shown in Fig. 1. These stages of the required precision arecommercially available and are shown in more detail in Fig. 4. The comb bridge seats itself into the two cylindrical groves and is mechanically or magnetically clamped to it. It can be moved into position by stepping motors in the z-direction (only one of the two is driven, the other acts as a slave) over 20 mm and in the y-direction over 60 mm, see Fig. 4. Using spacer blocks for each new layer, a few millimeters of motion will be sufficient for the y-direction. The load on each stage is less than 15 kg, hence, a precision of \(\pm\) 2 \(\upmu\)m is easily achieved. The stages are operated "open loop", hence, reproducibility, hysteresis, and z - y dependence are not an issue. It should be emphasized that the stages are not used to read the position of the bridges but are only used to move the bridges into the required position, The position of the bridges is measured by the laser beam/Si-strip system!

The source and detector plates are mounted at the ends of the table. They set up are a total of 18 laser beams, three for each layer, as further discussed in Section 3. The devices are mounted in sets of three (for the three-layer chambers), as shown in more detail in Fig. 5. The beam sources are individual diode lasers, or alternatively, distributed from one laser by a single mode fiber cable plus beam splitter. The detectors can either be the 1/3" CCD's as used in the RASNIK system, or alternatively, the Si-strip detectors of MPI Munich. These laser beams will be aligned and calibrated as described in detail in Section 4. The source and detector plates and their devices are mounted very solid and stable onto the table with the plates parallel to each other and perpendicular to the beams.

An alternative method would only require six laser beams (three for each multilayer) but three times as many detectors per comb bridge: this is discussed in Section 5.

A notable advantage of this assembly procedure is that each tube layer can bend, under computer control, into any shape required. This approach can be used to construct either stiff or flexible chambers for all octants of the barrel and end cap system, and can bend the tubes according to the wire sag required for the mounted chamber.

## 3 The Comb Bridges

The comb bridges are designed to be ridged members of about 2.4 m in length, corresponding to the widest chambers to be assembled. Its structural member is a 6" I-beam, but as it would bend under its own weight by 42 \(\upmu\)m, it is supported at its mid-point by a girdle system (see Fig. 2), reducing, for a two times 120 cm span, the maximum deflection to 1 \(\upmu\)m. A precision comb structure is mounted to the bottom of the I-beam as shown in Fig. 6. The diameter of these holes could be the nominal tube diameter plus 1-\(\sigma\) at the outer contact point and 0-\(\sigma\) on top. These holes will be spaced according to the tube spacing specification; where this method permits any gap (or none) between the tubes. The machining task of the combs, which is common to all proposed assembly systems, has to be performed precisely to 5 \(\upmu\)m.

The partial holes make contact over 160\({}^{\circ}\) of the circle and 18 mm along the tubes. The comb structure also includes a vacuum line as shown in Fig. 6 and with the "clam shell" fitted with a square (area 3 cm\({}^{2}\)) silicon o-ring, each tube will be "sucked" into the comb by a force of 3 Kg. Preliminary results are discussed in Section 9.

The number of comb bridges and their spacing depends on the tolerance of tube placement with respect to the wires. For a 6 m long chamber, five comb bridges with a spacing of 135-165-165-135 cm would result in a maximum deflection due to their own weight of 65 \(\upmu\)m. This could be reduced to 10 \(\upmu\)m by using 7 bridges. The comb bridges, as shown in Fig. 2, will hang from two beams on chains or springs and a thin aluminum rod will maintain their spacing before the tubes are picked up. Brackets on the end of the bridges, see Fig. 6, permit them to be placed onto the translation stages using a rod plus cylindrical grove system of about 10 cm in length. With the beams lowered further, the chains will hang loose and, with the aluminum rods providing little resistance, the position of the bridges is controlled by the stages only. The center of mass is well below the support points, hence, resulting in a stable system. The stability will be further improved by clamping the bridges to the stages.

Each comb bridge is fitted with three transparent Si-strip detectors, one on each end and one in the center, with their position calibrated to the comb structure and laser beams, as discussed in Sections 5. Hence, the position of all bridges and, therefore, of all tubes can be read from the detectors and the tubes are then directed to their precise position by the stages.

## 4 Alignment Procedure for the Laser Beams:

1. The Laser diodes (or fiber cables) and Si-strips (or CCD's) are mounted to \(\pm\) 1 mm precision onto the source or detector plates, respectively (see Fig. 5).
2. First, the detector plate is mounted immediately in front of the source plate, parallel and well aligned, and all beam positions are registered by their corresponding detector.
3. Next, the detector plate is mounted at the end of the table as shown in Fig. 1. The two plates will again be well aligned by equalizing the diagonals to 0.5 mm and by using a \(\upmu\) radian level.
4. The beams are registered again and are moved back to their previous detector positions, first by shimming the diodes and than by sliding a plano convex large focal length lens in front of the diodes as a variable prism[1]. Now, the beams will be perpendicular to the plates and parallel to each other. A precision of one \(\upmu\) radian at the detector is required; if this is not achieved (more iterations might be necessary), the angle is recorded and becomes part of the data base. Finally, sources and detectors will be mounted mechanically very stable.

## 5 Calibration Procedure for Comb Bridges and Laser Beams

1. The calibration rod pads, shown in Fig. 7, are 5 cm long and are mounted using a micro radian level below the position of the first comb bridge closest to the source plate. One is pinned to the table, the other one "floats". The rods are of the same diameter as the muon tubes and are spaced such as to leave the specified gap between tubes (this could be zero or a factor of the standard deviation of the outer tube diameter) and between the tubes and the table surface, the latter to be made up by epoxy. Hence, the ends of these rods will have a diameter corresponding to the pitch and the middle where the comb bridges are mounted according to the tube diameter.
2. The straightens of each comb bridge is verified using a separate stage and is adjusted by the top truss (see Fig. 2), if necessary. This stage could use a \(\upmu\) radian level or a digital comparator. If, during assembly, it becomes necessary to dynamically adjust the mid-point of the comb bridge, then the length of the truss can be changed by a heat source. The stiffness of the comb bridges can also be monitored by a RASNIK system, with the lens mounted at the midpoint[2]. This will add desired redundancy to the bridge alignment.

The purpose of the middle detectors and laser beams is to continuously monitor the straightness of the comb bridges; adjustments will be made if necessary.
3. The comb bridges, one by one, are set onto the four short rods and the three beam positions through their Si-strips are recorded. This calibrates all comb bridges, i.e. it references their Si-strip positions to the muon tubes. It should be noted that the rod pads are kept in the same position for the calibration of all bridges.
4. The second layers of rods are added, see Fig. 7, and the positions of one comb bridge is recorded and this is repeated with the third layer. This calibrates the positions of all the laser beams for the lower multilayer.
5. Then the spacer block, shown in Fig. 8, is mounted. This spacer block, including its spacer rods, is of the exact dimensions as the specified separation between corresponding upper and lower tube layers. The same comb bridge used in 4) will be used to record the positions of the upper three beams. This calibrates all laser beamswith respect to the coordinate system defined by the fixed and floating rod pads, i. e. the bottom tube layer.

6) The procedure (5) can be repeated at the detector end to check the calibration of the laser position.

An alternative approach is under consideration: by placing nine (three times three) Si-strip detectors onto the comb bridges only six laser beams will be necessary. The small test station under construction will compare the two approaches.

The laser beam positions can be independently verified by using a comparator to move a detector through all the beams. One could even verify all positions of all comb and alignment bridges directly, or use the comparator for calibration in the first place.

## 6 The Assembly and Gluing of the Multilayers and Spacer Structure.

1) Beads of epoxy of high viscosity ("A") are applied onto the foil. The first layer is set into it, from above, by means the comb bridges. Then epoxy of low viscosity and surface tension ("B") is applied from above to the joints between the tubes. Care must be taken to keep the epoxy away from the comb bridges, although a significant advantage of this method is that epoxy cannot drip onto the tooling.

2) After the epoxy has hardened sufficiently - two to six hours - the comb bridges are released. Epoxy beads ("A") are applied to the contact lines with the next layer, then layer two is set into its position and epoxy ("B") is applied between its tubes. This procedure is repeated for layer three.

3) The next step is the placing of the heavy spacer structure. The mounting brackets of the chamber, but not the support "platforms" for the alignment devices, are part of the spacer structure, hence, the spacer structure does not have to be precision aligned to the tube wires. The laser beams, although, can still be used to align the spacer structure with "ordinary" precision. Epoxy ("A") is applied to the lower multilayer and the spacer structure is set, using temporary brackets, onto the translation stages (90% of its weight will be counter balanced by springs from above) and moved into its specified position (\(\pm\)0.5 mm). The epoxy has to cure completely (16 hours?) before the weight of the spacer structure is released onto the bottom multilayer.

4) After the spacer structure has cured, the alignment platforms are precision mounted (epoxied) onto the structure. For this, we use a precision machined spacer structure bridge, see Fig. 9, which has been calibrated by setting it onto the four rods of the spacer block, see Fig. 7, and referenced to the laser beams, (corresponding to lower layer of upper multilayer). This will directly reference the alignment platforms to the tube wires!Then all the translation stages are moved up by setting them onto a beam (approximately equal in height to the spacer structure). For this assembly procedure foil strips of a few millimeters width have to be mounted on top of the spacer structure below the comb bridges to provide a base for the epoxy for the bottom layer of the upper multilayer. Finally, the mounting of the top layers follows the procedure of 1) and 2).

6) Finally, if desired, an aluminum foil is epoxied to the top tube layer.

It will be possible to epoxy two tube layers per day as little force will be exerted to the layer below, hence, the full procedure should take four to five days. This could be accelerated considerably (two days) by using fast curing epoxy in the comb regions.

## 7 Overall Precision and Accuracy:

Alignment of wires, tubes, and alignment platforms is achieved by precision machining (minimum number of components), combined with optical and mechanical referencing, hence, careful analysis of the final precision and accuracy is important.

The coordinate system for the chamber shall be defined by the four alignment device platforms and the precision of all the wires with respect to this coordinate system will be considered.

The misplacement of the wire with respect to the outside diameter of the tube and hence, to the comb position, will be assumed to be \(\delta_{1}\) (6 \(\mu\)m). The laser beam system will be aligned or calibrated and kept stable to \(\delta_{2}\) (4 \(\mu\)m). Si-strip detectors will be located with respect to the beams to \(\delta_{3}\) (5 \(\mu\)m).

Comb and alignment platform bridges shall be machined of aluminum at the nominal temperature. The overall machining tolerance over the complete comb bridge will (at a temperature gradient of 0.1\({}^{\circ}\)C or less) be \(\delta_{4}\) (5 \(\mu\)m, for 2 m bridge). Similarly, the alignment platform bridge will have an uncertainty \(\delta_{5}\) (5 \(\mu\)m).

These errors are not correlated, therefore the errors in wire position with respect to the alignment platforms will be the sum (in quadrature) of \(\delta_{1}\), \(\delta_{2}\), \(\delta_{3}\), \(\delta_{4}\) and \(\delta_{5}\). Hence, if the individual errors are as estimated above (the actual values have to be found by experimenting), then the total error will be 10 \(\mu\)m..

## 8 Some Advantages of the Boston Assembly:

1. It holds each single tube in its designated, precise position until the epoxy sets.
2. This is the only procedure proposed which assembles complete chambers, including alignment platforms, in one single, continuos operation.

3) Utilizes a minimum of precision (10 \(\mu\)m) parts: Comb bridges, spacer block, alignment platform bridge.
4) Spacer structures need only to be machined to \(\pm\) 1 mm precision.
5) Alignment platforms can be precisely attached to the spacer structure after the latter has been mounted.
6) It uses same stations for a variety of chamber sizes and shapes, also trapezoidal end cap chambers, see Fig. 10.
7) It allows easy "bending" under computer control of the tubes in all planes.
8) With the combs above the tubes at all times, contamination of the tooling by dripping epoxy is less likely.

## 9 Status and Ongoing Work:

Several single tube comb pieces with 6 mm vacuum holes were machined and a 0.250 mm wall tube was picked up by suction. It was found that a 160\({}^{\circ}\) degree piece of 18 mm length did not distort the tube in a measurable way. With this metal to metal seal the leak rate was 1 torr liter /sec, which is not practical for a large comb bridge. With a soft (50 durometry) rectangular, saddle-shaped silicon O-ring of 1.5 mm diameter and 0.1 mm oversize, the leak was reduced to less than 10-2 torr liter / sec and it was ascertained that the o-ring did not interfere with the referencing of the tube to the comb piece. With a surface of 3.0 cm\({}^{2}\) under vacuum the tube is able to support 3 kg, this was tested to weights of up to 2.5 kg.

We have started with the construction of a 100 cm long and 16 tube wide chamber, using two comb bridges, one at each end. As a first step we will assemble a multilayer and if successful we will advance to a full chamber.

We have received advice on epoxying from the MPI Munich group and we will collaborate further with this group on this effort. MPI Munich will also provide us with the Si-strip alignment system.
