## 1 Introduction

This note contains a more complete discussion about the quality of \(p_{T}^{miss}\) reconstruction in ATLAS (already described in [1]), some comments about the preliminar results obtained on the \(p_{T}^{miss}\) resolution at high luminosity (also reported in [1]) and also some checks about the effects of extending the \(\eta\) coverage above 5 on the \(p_{T}^{miss}\) resolution (see [2]).

The \(p_{T}^{miss}\) reconstruction is studied in the full simulated events for the TP in the physics channel: \(A\rightarrow\tau\tau\); for A masses in the range 100-500 Gev the typical \(p_{T}^{miss}\) values are in the range 20-100 GeV.

The results reported in the following are obtained with the separated preshower version for calorimeters and with a Geant cutoff in the full simulation of 100 KeV.

In the forward region, \(3<|\eta|<5\), the contribution of the calorimeter resolution to the accuracy of the \(p_{T}^{miss}\) measurement is small (see section 2.1) and the computer time needed for full simulation very large, therefore the particles in this region were not fully simulated but their energies were appropriately smeared.

## 2 Quality of \(p_{T}^{miss}\) reconstruction

The x and y components of \(p_{T}^{miss}\) are calculated from the transverse energies deposited in the cells with \(|\eta|<\)3 and summed as:

\[E_{T}\ =\ \alpha\cdot E_{T}^{PRE}\ +\ \beta\cdot E_{T}^{ECAL}\ +\ \gamma\cdot E_{T}^{HCAL}\]

where \(ECAL\) is the electromagnetic calorimeter, \(HCAL\) is the hadronic one and \(PRE\) is the preshower and 3 different sets of calibration constants \(\alpha\), \(\beta\), \(\gamma\) are chosen for cells in an electromagnetic cluster, in a hadronic cluster and outside clusters. Formore details about the method of calibration of the calorimeters cells see section 3.1 of [1].

In the following it will be shown that the most relevant points for the quality of the \(p_{T}^{miss}\) reconstruction (optimisation of the resolution) are:

* accurate calorimeters calibration and inter-calibration, in particular of the barrel+ EC region that gives the most important contribution to the \(p_{T}^{miss}\) resolution (see section 2.1)
* the contribution of low energy cells (including the cells outside clusters) cannot be neglected (see section 2.2)
* the cell energy cutoff applied after the addition of noise must be tuned accurately (see section 2.2)

The resolution of each \(p_{T}^{miss}\) component is computed as difference between \(p_{x}^{miss}\)or \(p_{y}^{miss}\)calculated at particle level, that is using the generated energies and directions, without \(\eta\) cut, and \(p_{x}^{miss}\)or \(p_{y}^{miss}\)calculated from calorimeters with a coverage \(|\eta|<5\) (full simulation for \(|\eta|<3\) and appropriate smearing for \(3<|\eta|<5\)).

To understand the importance of the above points, it has to be noted that the \(p_{x}^{miss}\), \(p_{y}^{miss}\) resolution for \(m_{A}\)=300 has been improved from a value\(\sim\)13 GeV (obtained in the first full simulation study done by us in 1993 - see Fig.1 of [3]-) to a value of 9.4 GeV (see fourth plot of Fig.3 of [1]).

The wider distribution of [3] is explained by the following facts:

* there was a difference of absolute calibration between barrel-EC-FWD of about 5% (see Tab. 1 of [3])
* there was no \(\eta\) dependence in calibration constants \(\alpha,\beta,\gamma\)
* part of the low-energy cells were lost due to a higher GEANT cutoff (10 MeV instead of 100 KeV) used to simulate the events
* no low-energy cells correction was applied

It has to be reminded that the resolution on each \(p_{T}^{miss}\) component depends on the \(\Sigma E_{T}\) in calorimeters and it is well described by the simple formula 0.46 \(\times\)\(\sqrt{\Sigma\,E_{T}}\) at a luminosity of 10\({}^{33}\) cm\({}^{-2}\)s\({}^{-1}\), where \(\Sigma\,E_{T}\) is the total transverse energy measured in calorimeters.

For the A events \(\Sigma E_{T}\) increases with the produced A mass, so the \(p_{T}^{miss}\) resolution goes from \(\sim\) 6 to \(\sim\) 10 GeV when the A mass ranges from 100 to 500 GeV.

### Importance of the various \(\eta\) regions for the \(p_{T}^{miss}\) resolution

As it has been already said in [1], it is essential to use also the forward region (\(3<|\eta|<5\)) in the \(p_{T}^{miss}\) calculation: the contribution to the resolution of each \(p_{T}^{miss}\) component increases from 2.3 GeV to 8.3 GeV (for mA=150 GeV events) going from an \(\eta\) coverage of 5 to an \(\eta\) coverage of 3.

On the other end, the contribution from that region to the \(p_{T}^{miss}\) resolution is small, as it can be seen from Fig. 1, where the contribution to the \(p_{x}^{miss}\), \(p_{y}^{miss}\) resolution from different parts of the calorimeters system is shown for events with mA=150 GeV. Each plot gives the difference between \(\Sigma p_{\pi}(p_{y})\) in the specified \(\eta\) range calculated at particle level and in full simulation, taking into account the contribution from the electronic noise in electromagnetic barrel and EC, as explained in the following section; the fourth plot is also done in full simulation (a limited sample of events was fully simulated over \(|\eta|<5\)), but has no addition of the electronic noise. The main contribution (5.8 GeV) comes from barrel region, while there is a contribution of 3.8 Gev from the EC region and of 2.4 GeV from the forward region. For that reason it is justified to have performed a full simulation until \(\eta\)=3 and to have added the contribution of the region \(3<|\eta|<5\) at particle level, smeared according to the experimental resolution, as it has been done for the A events in [1].

Note that Fig. 1 has been done in the case of low luminosity: at high luminosity, taking into account also the pile-up (\(\sigma_{pile-up}\div 1/sin\theta\)), the contribution from the EC region to the \(p_{T}^{miss}\)resolution can become comparable to the contribution of the barrel one.

### Importance of the contribution of low-energy cells and electronic noise

An electronic noise with an \(\sigma\) parametrised as in [4] in the electromagnetic calorimeter (the case with 0T preamplifiers in the first sample and AsGa preamplifiers in the second and third sample for the barrel is considered), and a \(\sigma\) of 2.5 MeV in the preshower was added at the cell level. The values of the noise in electromagnetic calorimeter used here are not very different from the values reported in TP.

Only those cells with energy \(>1.5\)\(\sigma_{noise}\) were considered; the requirement used in the optimisation of this cut is the minimisation of both the difference between the reconstructed jet energies and the deterioration of the \(p_{T}^{miss}\) resolution with and without the noise added.

Fig. 2(a) shows the resolution of \(p_{T}^{miss}\) calculated as explained in [1] without noise addition; Fig. 2(b) shows how the \(p_{T}^{miss}\) resolution becomes if the cells outside clusters are not considered: the \(\sigma\) is worse by a factor \(\sim 1.3\); Fig. 2(c) is done adding the electronic noise and applying a cell energy cutoff of 1.5 \(\sigma_{noise}\) (the contribution to the \(p_{T}^{miss}\)resolution of electronic noise results of \(\sim 3\) GeV); Fig. 2(d) shows that the \(p_{T}^{miss}\) resolution again is worse by a factor \(\sim 1.3\) if the threshold cut is 2.5 \(\sigma_{noise}\). So from Fig. 2 it can be concluded that in the \(p_{T}^{miss}\) calculation the contribution of all cells must be taken into account: the cells outside clusters (reconstructed starting from a seed of 1 GeV) that are \(>50\%\) of the occupied cells must be used in the calculation; enlarging the cell energy cutoff deteriorates the \(p_{T}^{miss}\) resolution as it can be seen going from a cutoff of 1.5 to one of 2.5 \(\sigma_{noise}\): this deterioration depends on the absolute value of the cell energy cutoff, so it is bigger if the electronic noise is higher.

The use of an ad-hoc calibration for the cells outside clusters improves slightly the \(p_{T}^{miss}\) resolution, because it takes into account the non linearity of the calorimeter response to low energy particles [3].

Of course the hardware limit on the cells energy readout must be lower than the cut used in the analysis (from 25 to 50 MeV at \(\eta=0\) in barrel depending from the sample -noise increases with \(\eta\)., from 35 to 60 MeV in EC depending from the sample at largest eta -noise decreases with \(\eta\)., and 4 MeV in PS). The minimum cell energy to be read is expected to be 30-50 MeV in the em calorimeter (see [5]), depending on the dynamic range requested; in the PS the cut is very low (4 MeV), but in any case using a higher cut (by a factor 10) on the PS cells gives a small effect (\(<10\%\)).

In [1] the electronic noise in the hadronic EC was not added: the addition of a noise of 200 MeV/cell in each compartment of ENDH, value taken from [6], with cell energy cutoff of 1.5 \(\sigma_{noise}\), degrades the \(p_{T}^{miss}\) resolution of \(\sim 10\%\).

The electronic noise in TILE and TIXE is foreseen to be small and all the \(10^{4}\) cells are foreseen to be read. Using in TILE and TIXE the same eletronic noise of 200 MeV/cell (that is a value surely overestimated, a more realistic value is more than a factor 2 less [7]) and the same cut as in hadronic EC, the \(p_{T}^{miss}\) resolution degrades of a factor \(\sim 20\%\).

Applying the noise at cell level and applying the cutoff at tower level (\(E_{tover}>1.5\)\(\sigma_{noise\ tower}\)) in the electromagnetic calorimeter gives comparable results on the \(p_{T}^{miss}\) resolution.

## 3 High luminosity results

In section 6 of [1] a preliminar study at high luminosity has been done for the \(p_{T}^{miss}\) resolution, that results about a factor 2 worse than at low luminosity. The treatment is approximate: the pile-up energy is assumed gaussian, the \(\sigma\) is assumed constant in depth and the pile-up contribution is added incoherently on all the cells. The \(\sigma\) energy values used are: 40 MeV/\(sin(\theta)\) per cell in the electromagnetic calorimeters and 180 MeV/\(sin(\theta)\) per cell in the hadronic calorimeters.

It must be noticed that the cell energy cutoff applied in that case, corresponding to values above 2.5\(\sigma\) of the total noise (electronic noise+pile-up, added in quadrature) is quite high: of the order of 150 \(MeV\) in the electromagnetic calorimeter and \(\sim\) 450 \(MeV\) in the hadronic calorimeter at \(\eta\)=0 (remember that \(\sigma_{pile-up}\div 1/sin\theta\)). That cut has been applied to maintain the correct jet energy and it also optimizes the \(p_{T}^{miss}\) resolution, as it can be seen from Fig. 3, where different cell energy cutoffs were applied (respectively \(>\) 2.5\(\sigma\), 1.5\(\sigma\), 2\(\sigma\), 3\(\sigma\)), using always the same limited event sample (\(\sim\) 250 events).

Fig. 4 is the TP figure with superimposed the \(p_{T}^{miss}\) resolution obtained at low luminosity with a cell threshold cutoff of 2.5 \(\sigma_{noise}\): the curve is higher than that one for low luminosity but still lower than that one for high luminosity. It has also to be noticed that in the plot \(\Sigma E_{T}\) is calculated as the sum of the transverse energies of all calorimeter cells calibrated (as explained in section 3.1 of [1]) surviving after the cell energy threshold cutoff, so the cell energy threshold affects also the horizontal scale of the plot. The present conclusion is that the deterioration of the \(p_{T}^{miss}\) resolution going from \(10^{33}\) cm\({}^{-2}\)s\({}^{-1}\)to \(10^{34}\) cm\({}^{-2}\)s\({}^{-1}\)is due to the combined effect of adding the pile-up contribution and having a higher cell threshold cut; on the other hand, in this case, lowering the cell energy cut means to add to the true event energy a large quantity of spurious energy due to the pile-up.

In addition, as it was already pointed out in [1], the pile-up in TILE and TIXE is expected to be smaller; if the lower estimation is used (\(70/sin(\theta)\) MeV per cell in the first compartment, and \(45/sin(\theta)\), \(15/sin(\theta)\) in the second and third compartment respectively, that is an updated estimation for TILE and TIXE), the \(p_{T}^{miss}\) resolution given in TP for the high luminosity case goes down by a factor \(\sim 15-20\%\) (see Fig 5). The formula \(\sigma(p_{x}^{miss},p_{y}^{miss})=0.95\,\times\,\sqrt{\Sigma\,E_{T}}\) gives the \(p_{T}^{miss}\) resolution at a luminosity of \(10^{84}\) cm\({}^{-2}\)s\({}^{-1}\).

A more precise study of the high luminosity is foreseen in the next future superposing weighted minimum bias on the interesting events.

## 4 \(\eta\) coverage effect at low luminosity

In [2] the advantages of the possibility to extend the calorimeters \(\eta\) coverage from 5 until 7.6, adding a very forward calorimeter are studied. The evaluation was done at particle level smeared according to the expected calorimeter resolutions using the A events in the \(e-\mu\) channel: the result presented there is a gain of \(\sim 1.5\) in significance at high luminosity.

The result has to be checked with a more realistic simulation of the very forward region (calorimeter, cryostat, vacuum pumps, cracks...). What it has been done here is to check if it is critical to use the \(e-\mu\) channel instead of the lepton-hadron channel and if the full simulation at least in the \(|\eta|<3\) region affects the conclusions.

Fig. 6 shows the \(p_{T}^{miss}\) resolution and Fig. 7 shows the \(\sigma(m_{\tau\tau})\) as a function of the \(\eta\) coverage for the \(e-\mu\) and lepton -hadron channels at particle level (pl) and full simulated until \(|\eta|\)=3. The first conclusion from those plots is that there is no appreciable difference between the lepton-hadron and the \(e-\mu\) channels, considering both the particle level and the full simulation situation. In fact it has been verified that also for the A in the \(e-\mu\) channel the \(p_{T}^{miss}\) resolution can be expressed by the formula \(\sigma(p_{x}^{miss},p_{y}^{miss})=0.46\times\sqrt{E_{T}}\); for the \(\sigma(m_{\tau\tau})\) it has been shown in [1] that the contribution of the jet resolution to the \(m_{\tau\tau}\) resolution is negligible (see Fig. 5 and 6 of [1]). Also superimposed are the results presented in [2] at low luminosity for the \(e-\mu\) channel, that, as said above are obtained with a particle level smeared. These results are in fact worse than the pure particle level but are also better than the full simulated ones, that have non gaussian tails. Finally in Fig. 8 the same results are presented in a different way, to be independent from the gaussian fit to \(m_{\tau\tau}\) distribution, plotting the mass bin width necessary to get always the same efficiency in the \(m_{\tau\tau}\) cut = 85%.

The present conclusion is that in full simulation the gain going from \(\eta\) = 5 to 7.6 coverage is less significant than the gain calculated at particle level.

## 5 Conclusions

In conclusion a list of items that is important to check in the near future is reported:

* study of the \(p_{T}^{miss}\) resolution with the new experimental layout of calorimeters in \(|\eta|<5\)
* careful calibration of all calorimeters and tuning of cell energy cutoff after noise addition
* check of the hardware energy thresholds in all the calorimeters
* more precise study of the high luminosity with the superposition of weighted minimum bias on the interesting events* careful study of the criteria for the choice of the cell energy cutoff to apply at high luminosity
