###### Abstract

The sensitivity of the ATLAS experiment in the search for flavour-changing neutral-current top quark decays is presented. The study is performed in the context of the high luminosity phase of the Large Hadron Collider with a centre-of-mass energy of 14 TeV and an integrated luminosity of 3000 fb\({}^{-1}\). The three charged lepton final state of top-quark pair events is considered, in which one of the top quarks decays through the \(t\to qZ\) (\(q=u,c\)) flavour-changing neutral-current channel and the other one decays to \(bW\) (\(t\bar{t}\to bWqZ\to b\ell\nu q\ell\)). An improvement by a factor of four is expected over the current Run-2 analysis results of \(\mathcal{B}(t\to uZ)<1.7\times 10^{-4}\) and \(\mathcal{B}(t\to cZ)<2.4\times 10^{-4}\) with 36.1 fb\({}^{-1}\) integrated luminosity. Obtained branching ratio limits are at the level of 4 to \(5\times 10^{-5}\) depending on the considered scenarios for the systematic uncertainties.

## 1 Introduction

The top quark is the heaviest elementary particle known, with a mass of \(m_{t}=172.5\pm 0.5\) GeV [1], and has such a small lifetime that it decays before hadronisation occurs. Flavour-changing neutral current (FCNC) decays such as \(t\to qZ\) are forbidden at tree level. FCNC decays occur at one-loop level but are strongly suppressed by the GIM mechanism [2] with a suppression factor of 14 orders of magnitude relative to the dominant decay mode [3]. However, several SM extensions predict higher branching ratios for top-quark FCNC decays. Examples of such extensions are the quark-singlet model (QS) [4], the two-Higgs-doublet model with (FC 2HDM) or without (2HDM) flavour conservation [5], the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) [6], the MSSM with R-parity violation (RPV SUSY) [7], models with warped extra dimensions (RS) [8], or extended mirror fermion models (EMF) [9]. Reference [10] gives a comprehensive review of the various extensions of the SM that have been proposed. Table 1 provides the maximum values for the branching ratios \(\mathcal{B}(t\to qZ)\) predicted by these models and compares them to the value predicted by the SM.

Experimental limits on the FCNC branching ratio \(\mathcal{B}(t\to qZ)\) were established by experiments at the Large Electron-Positron collider [11, 12, 13, 14, 15], HERA [16], the Tevatron [17, 18], and the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) [19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24]. The latest experimental limits are set by the CMS and ATLAS Collaborations. Limits of \(\mathcal{B}(t\to uZ)<2.4\times 10^{-4}\) and \(\mathcal{B}(t\to cZ)<4.5\times 10^{-4}\) at 95% confidence level (CL), are obtained by the CMS Collaboration using data collected at \(\sqrt{s}=13\) TeV [21]. For the same centre-of-mass energy, the ATLAS Collaboration derived the limits of \(\mathcal{B}(t\to uZ)<1.7\times 10^{-4}\) and \(\mathcal{B}(t\to cZ)<2.4\times 10^{-4}\)[24].

The High Luminosity upgrade of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) (HL-LHC) is currently expected to begin operations in the second half of 2026 [25, 26], to achieve an ultimate luminosity of \(7.5\times 10^{34}\) cm\({}^{-2}\)s\({}^{-1}\). The total integrated luminosity that is foreseen to be reached is 3000 fb\({}^{-1}\). This note presents a study of the sensitivity of the ATLAS experiment to top-quark decays via FCNC \(t\to qZ\) (\(q=u\), \(c\) with \(Z\to\ell^{+}\ell^{-}\)). The top-quark-top-antiquark (\(t\bar{t}\)) events are studied, where one top quark decays through the FCNC mode and the other through the dominant SM mode (\(t\to bW\)). Only \(Z\) boson decays into charged leptons and leptonic \(W\) boson decays are considered. The final-state topology is thus characterized by the presence of three isolated charged leptons, at least two jets with exactly one being tagged as a jet containing a \(b\)-hadron, and missing transverse momentum from the undetected neutrino. The study is performed in the context of the LHC upgrade.

Based on the Run-1 search [23], the ATLAS detector sensitivity to FCNC \(t\to qZ\) decays for the HL-LHC was studied and reported in Ref. [27], predicting a sensitivity of \((2.4-5.8)\times 10^{-5}\), when considering statistical uncertainties only, depending on the exact FCNC \(t\to qZ\) modeling and \((8.3-41)\times 10^{-5}\), depending on the detailed assumptions for the systematic uncertainties. In the present analysis the description of the expected detector performance at the HL-LHC phase is improved and the analysis strategy closely follows the one of the Run-2 analysis [24] rather than the Run-1 search.

\begin{tabular}{l c c c c c c c} \hline Model: & SM & QS & 2HDM & FC 2HDM & MSSM & RPV SUSY & RS & EMF \\ \hline \(\mathcal{B}(t\to qZ)\): & \(10^{-14}\) & \(10^{-4}\) & \(10^{-6}\) & \(10^{-10}\) & \(10^{-7}\) & \(10^{-6}\) & \(10^{-5}\) & \(10^{-6}\) \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}

Since it is difficult to accurately estimate the relevant systematic uncertainties that will impact the analysis in the high luminosity environment, several scenarios are studied and compared.

## 2 Signal and background simulation samples

Particle-level samples are generated at a center-of-mass energy of 14 TeV without detailed detector simulation. To emulate the HL-LHC run conditions and detector response, physics objects defined in Section 3 are smeared using performance functions derived from MC events passed through a full GEANT4 simulation of the upgraded ATLAS detector [28; 29; 30]. The effect of objects reconstruction and identification efficiencies as well as their momentum or energy resolutions are parameterized assuming an average number of additional \(pp\) collisions in the same or nearby bunch crossings (pile-up) of 200. In addition, pile-up jets are overlaid from a dedicated library.

In \(pp\) collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of \(\sqrt{s}=14\) TeV at the LHC, top quarks are produced according to the SM mainly in \(t\bar{t}\) pairs with a predicted cross section of \(\sigma_{t\bar{t}}=0.98\pm 0.06\) nb [31; 32; 33; 34; 35; 36]. The uncertainty includes contributions from uncertainties in the factorisation and renormalization scales, the parton distribution functions (PDF), the strong coupling \(\alpha_{\mathrm{S}}\) and the top-quark mass. The cross section is calculated at next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) in QCD including resummation of next-to-next-to-leading logarithmic soft gluon terms with Top++ 2.0. The effects of PDF and \(\alpha_{\mathrm{S}}\) uncertainties are calculated using the PDF4LHC prescription [37] with the MSTW 2008 68% CL NNLO [38; 39], CT10 NNLO [40; 41] and NNPDF 2.3 5f FFN [42] PDF sets and are added in quadrature to those from the renormalization and factorisation scale uncertainties. These calculations are done for the top-quark mass value of 172.5 GeV used to simulate events as described in the following paragraphs.

The next-to-leading-order (NLO) simulation of signal events was performed with the event generator MG5_aMC@NLO[43] interfaced to Pythia8[44] with the A14[45] set of tuned parameters and the NNPDF3@ME PDF set [42]. Top quark FCNC decay is done using the TopFCNC model [46; 47]. The effects of new physics at an energy scale \(\Lambda\) were included by adding dimension-six effective terms to the SM Lagrangian. The Universal FeynRules Output (UFO) model [46; 47] is used for computation at NLO in QCD. No differences between the kinematical distributions from the \(bWuZ\) and \(bWcZ\) processes are observed. Due to the different \(b\)-tagging mistag rates for \(u\)- and \(c\)-quarks, the signal efficiencies differ after applying requirements on the \(b\)-tagged jet multiplicity. Hence limits on \(\mathcal{B}(t\to qZ)\) are set separately for \(q=u,c\). Only decays of the \(W\) and \(Z\) bosons with charged leptons were generated (\(Z\to e^{+}e^{-}\), \(\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\), or \(\tau^{+}\tau^{-}\) and \(W\to e\nu\), \(\mu\nu\), or \(\tau\nu\)).

Several SM processes have final-state topologies similar to the signal, with at least three prompt1 charged leptons, especially dibosons (\(WZ\) and \(ZZ\)), but also \(t\bar{t}Z\), \(t\bar{t}W\), \(t\bar{t}WW\), \(tZ\) or \(t\bar{t}t\bar{t}\) production. Events with non-prompt leptons, including the ones in which at least one jet is misidentified as a charged lepton, can also fulfil the event selection requirements. These events mainly consist of the \(t\bar{t}\), \(Z\)+jets and \(tW\) processes. Such background processes cannot be realistically estimated by the transfer function approach used for the HL-LHC studies. Therefore, these backgrounds are scaled to the same fraction of the total event yield as observed in the 13 TeV analysis [24]. All other background samples are normalized to their theory predictions.

Table 2 summarizes information about the generators, parton shower, and PDFs used to simulate the different event samples considered in this analysis.

## 3 Object reconstruction

Electrons and muons are required to have \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>25\) GeV. This threshold is increased in relation to the Run 2 analysis [24] due to the expected higher yields of non-prompt lepton backgrounds. The single lepton trigger thresholds during the HL-LHC phase are expected to be 22 GeV for electrons and 20 GeV for muons [55], safely below the offline \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) requirement of 25 GeV considered in this analysis. Therefore no significant efficiency loss is expected from trigger threshold effects.

Electrons are required to be outside the transition region between the barrel and endcap calorimeters with \(1.37<|\eta_{\mathrm{cluster}}|<1.52\). Electrons and muons with \(|\eta|>2.5\) are rejected. Reconstructed leptons within a cone of \(\Delta R<0.2\) of jets are removed. A truth-based isolation requirement is applied to the leptons, meaning that the sum of the transverse energies of stable2 charged and neutral generator-level particles, with the exception of neutrinos, within a \(\Delta R=0.2\) cone around the lepton must be less than 23% (11%) of the electron (muon) candidate \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\). This requirement yields an efficiency of 95% for the prompt leptons and 37% (21%) efficiency for non-prompt electrons (muons) with 25 < \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) < 50 GeV in the \(t\bar{t}\) events.

Footnote 2: Particles in the MC event record with status code 1: a final-state particle, i.e. a particle that is not decayed further by the generator [56; 57].

The missing transverse momentum (\(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\)) is defined at particle level as the transverse component of the vector sum of the final-state neutrino momenta. The \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\) resolution is parameterized as a function of the overall event activity.

Jets are reconstructed using the anti-\(k_{t}\) algorithm [58; 59] with a radius parameter \(R=0.4\). They are required to have \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>30\) GeV and \(|\eta|<4.5\). Jets containing \(b\)-hadrons are randomly \(b\)-tagged to follow the 70% \(b\)-jet tagging efficiency working point of the MV2c10 algorithm [60]. The rejection rates for light-flavour jet and c-jet depend on the jet \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) and can be found in Ref. [60].

## 4 Event selection and reconstruction

The selection requirements follow the ones from the Run 2 analysis. Events are required to have exactly three leptons (any combination of electrons and muons), at least two jets, with exactly one of them \(b\)-tagged, one pair of opposite charge and same flavour leptons with \(|m_{\ell^{+}\ell^{-}}-91.2\GeV|<15\GeV\) and \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}>20\GeV\). If more than one compatible lepton pair is found in the selection, the one with the reconstructed mass closest to 91.2 \(\GeV\) is chosen as the \(Z\) boson candidate. The selection is finalized with the kinematical requirements explained next. For each possible jet combination, the following \(\chi^{2}\) function is minimized to derive the longitudinal momentum of the neutrino and, consequently, to reconstruct the top-quarks and the \(W\) boson. The solution (among all possible jet combinations) that yields the minimum \(\chi^{2}\) value is chosen.

\[\chi^{2}=\frac{\left(m_{j_{a}\ell_{a}\ell_{b}}^{\mathrm{reco}}-m_{\mathrm{{}_{ H_{\mathrm{FCNC}}}}}\right)^{2}}{\sigma_{\mathrm{{}_{H_{\mathrm{FCNC}}}}}^{2}}+ \frac{\left(m_{j_{b}\ell_{c}\nu}^{\mathrm{reco}}-m_{\mathrm{{}_{H_{\mathrm{SM}}} }}\right)^{2}}{\sigma_{\mathrm{{}_{SM}}}^{2}}+\frac{\left(m_{\ell_{c}\nu}^{ \mathrm{reco}}-m_{W}\right)^{2}}{\sigma_{W}^{2}},\]

where \(m_{j_{a}\ell_{a}\ell_{b}}^{\mathrm{reco}}\), \(m_{j_{b}\ell_{c}\nu}^{\mathrm{reco}}\), and \(m_{\ell_{c}\nu}^{\mathrm{reco}}\) are the reconstructed masses of the \(qZ\), \(bW\), and \(\ell\nu\) systems, respectively, corresponding to the top-quarks and the \(W\) boson, respectively. For each jet combination, \(j_{b}\) corresponds to the \(b\)-tagged jet, while any non-\(b\)-tagged jet can be assigned to \(j_{a}\). The central values of the masses and the widths of the top quarks and the \(W\) boson are taken from simulated signal events. This is done by matching the particles in the simulated events to the reconstructed ones, setting the longitudinal momentum of the neutrino to the \(p_{z}\) of the simulated neutrino, and then performing fitting to a Bukin function3[61] to the masses of the matched reconstructed top quarks and \(W\) boson. The obtained values are \(m_{\mathrm{{}_{H_{\mathrm{FCNC}}}}}=171.4\GeV\), \(\sigma_{\mathrm{{}_{H_{\mathrm{FCNC}}}}}=13.1\GeV\), \(m_{\mathrm{{}_{\mathrm{SM}}}}=177.1\GeV\), \(\sigma_{\mathrm{{}_{\mathrm{SM}}}}=38.1\GeV\), \(m_{W}=85.7\GeV\) and \(\sigma_{W}=30.2\GeV\). Values for the \(\sigma_{\mathrm{{}_{\mathrm{SM}}}}\) and \(\sigma_{W}\) are high due to the negative influence of the high pileup on the \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\) resolution used to reconstruct the neutrino from the \(t\to bW\to j\ell\nu\) decay. The events are then required to have \(|m_{\mathrm{{}_{H_{\mathrm{FCNC}}}}}^{\mathrm{reco}}-172.5\GeV|<40\GeV\), \(|m_{\mathrm{{}_{\mathrm{SM}}}}^{\mathrm{reco}}-172.5\GeV|<60\GeV\) and \(|m_{W}^{\mathrm{reco}}-80.4\GeV|<50\GeV\) to remove outliers where the expected signal contribution is small. Note that the two last values were increased with respected to the 13 \(\TeV\) analysis due to the worse resolutions shown here. The fractions of correct assignments between the reconstructed top quarks and the true simulated top quarks at parton level (evaluated as a match within a cone of size \(\Delta R=0.4\)) are \(\epsilon_{\mathrm{{}_{H_{\mathrm{FCNC}}}}}=76\%\) and \(\epsilon_{\mathrm{{}_{\mathrm{SM}}}}=40\%\), where the difference comes from the fact that for the SM top-quark decay the match of the \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\) with the simulated neutrino is less efficient.

Footnote 3: These fits use a piecewise function with a Gaussian function in the centre and two asymmetric tails. Six parameters determine the overall normalization, the peak position, the width of the core, the asymmetry, the size of the lower tail, and the size of the higher tail. Of these, only the peak position and the width enter the \(\chi^{2}\).

Following the strategy of the Run-2 analysis, dedicated control regions (CR) are defined for the main background contributions to help constrain systematic uncertainties. Here only CR for \(t\bar{t}Z\) and non-prompt leptons were defined. The \(t\bar{t}Z\) CR requires exactly three leptons, two of them with the same flavour, opposite charge and reconstructed mass within 15 \(\GeV\) of the \(Z\) boson mass. Furthermore, the events are required to have at least four jets, two of which must be \(b\)-tagged, and \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}>20\GeV\). The non-prompt lepton background CR requires three leptons with two of them having the same flavour, opposite charge and reconstructed mass outside 15 \(\GeV\) of the \(Z\) boson mass, at least two jets with one being \(b\)-tagged and \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}>20\GeV\).

Selection requirements applied in the signal and background control regions are summarized in Table 3. The expected distributions of relevant observables in the signal region are shown in Figure 1.

## 5 Systematic uncertainties

The background fit to the CRs, described in Section 6, reduces the systematic uncertainty from some sources, due to the constraints introduced by the Asimov simulated data. The main uncertainties, in both the background and signal estimations, are expected to come from theoretical normalization uncertainties and uncertainties in the modelling of background processes in the simulation. The effect of those uncertainties is estimated in the 13 TeV analysis, and then reduced by a factor of two, as recommended in Ref. [62], to account for expected improvements in theoretical predictions. The reduced uncertainty is then applied in this analysis. The uncertainties obtained before the combined fit are discussed below and are summarized in Table 4.

The cross section uncertainties of the \(t\bar{t}Z\) and \(tZ\) background processes are taken to be 6% and 15%, respectively. For diboson production, a 6% theoretical normalization uncertainty is considered as well as 24% uncertainty on the \(WZ\) production in the SR due to the modelling in the simulation. In addition, a 12% uncertainty added in quadrature per jet is applied on the \(WZ\) yield in each jet multiplicity bin to account for the imperfect knowledge of the jet multiplicity distribution in \(WZ\) events. The \(t\bar{t}\) production cross-section uncertainties from the independent variation of the factorisation and renormalization scales, the PDF choice, and \(\alpha_{\mathrm{S}}\) variations (see Refs. [36; 37] and references therein and Refs. [39; 41; 42]) give a 5% uncertainty in the signal normalization and 4% uncertainty on the total non-prompt leptons background in the SR. The 12% and 5% uncertainties due to the choice of NLO generator and amount of QCD radiation for the \(t\bar{t}\) modelling are considered on the total non-prompt leptons background in the SR, while the uncertainty due to the choice of the parton shower algorithm is 1% in the SR and 19% in the non-prompt leptons CR. A 17% uncertainty is considered on the \(Z\)+jets normalization, which yields a 2.5% uncertainty on the total non-prompt leptons background in the SR. For the remaining small backgrounds, a 50% uncertainty is assumed.

For both the estimated signal and background event yields, experimental uncertainties resulting from detector effects are assumed to be same as in the 13 TeV analysis. The uncertainties on the lepton

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{l c c c} \hline \hline Selection & Signal Region & \(t\bar{t}Z\) CR & Non-prompt lepton CR \\ \hline No. leptons & 3 & 3 & 3 \\ OSSF & Yes & Yes & Yes \\ \(|m_{\ell\ell}^{\mathrm{reco}}-91.2\) GeV\(|\) & \(<15\) GeV & \(<15\) GeV & \(>15\) GeV \\ No. jets & \(\geq 2\) & \(\geq 4\) & \(\geq 2\) \\ No. \(b\)-tagged jets & 1 & 2 & 1 \\ \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\) & \(>20\) GeV & \(>20\) GeV & \(>20\) GeV \\ \(|m_{\ell\nu}^{\mathrm{reco}}-80.4\) GeV\(|\) & \(<50\) GeV & - & - \\ \(|m_{\ell\bar{t}\nu}^{\mathrm{reco}}-172.5\) GeV\(|\) & \(<60\) GeV & - & - \\ \(|m_{j\ell\ell}^{\mathrm{reco}}-172.5\) GeV\(|\) & \(<40\) GeV & - & - \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 3: The selection requirements applied for the signal and background control regions. OSSF refers to the presence of a pair of opposite-sign, same-flavour leptons.

The signal is not shown stacked on top of the backgrounds, but is normalized separately to an arbitrary branching ratio of \(\mathcal{B}(t\to qZ)=0.1\%\). The dashed area represents the systematic uncertainty on the background prediction.

reconstruction, identification and trigger efficiencies, as well as lepton momentum scales and resolutions, are added in quadrature resulting in a 2.6% (1.9%) uncertainty on the total background (signal) event yield in the SR. The uncertainty due to the jet-energy scale and resolution is 9% (4%) on the total background (signal) event yield in the SR, while total \(b\)-tagging uncertainty, which includes the uncertainty of the \(b\)-, \(c\)-, mistagged- and \(\tau\)-jet scale factors, is 5% (3.4%). Uncertainties of the \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\) scale and pile-up effects are 4% and 2.3% on the total background and signal yields in the SR, respectively.

The total uncertainties of the leptons, jets, \(b\)-tagging, \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\) and pile-up uncertainties on the total background/signal event yields are considered on each background/signal process as an input normalization uncertainty for the combined fit.

The shape uncertainties are not considered, assuming that their effect on the final results is not significant, as it is found in the 13analysis.

The MC statistical uncertainties are set to zero in the analysis, unless it is mentioned that they are considered, assuming that sufficiently large simulation samples will be available for the HL-LHC analysis.

## 6 Results

A simultaneous fit to the SR and the two CRs is used to search for a signal from FCNC decays of the top quark. A maximum-likelihood fit is performed to kinematic distributions in the signal and control regions to test for the presence of signal events. Contamination of the CRs by the signal is negligible. The kinematic distributions used in the fit are the \(\chi^{2}\) of the kinematical reconstruction for the SR and the leading lepton \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) for the \(t\bar{t}Z\) and non-prompt leptons CRs. The expected number of events in each region are shown in Table 5 with the total systematic uncertainties before (after) the combined fit under the background-only hypothesis, while the expected distributions are presented in Figures 2-4.

The statistical analysis to extract the signal is based on a binned likelihood function \(L(\mu,\theta)\) as for the Run-2 search [24]. The \(L(\mu,\theta)\) is constructed as a product of Poisson probability terms over all bins in each considered distribution, and Gaussian constraint terms for \(\theta\), a set of nuisance parameters that parameterize effects of systematic uncertainties on the signal and background expectations. The parameter \(\mu\) is a multiplicative factor for the number of signal events normalized to a branching ratio \(\mathcal{B}_{\mathrm{ref}}(t\to qZ)=0.1\%\). In the absence of FCNC signal, upper limits on \(\mathcal{B}(t\to qZ)\) can be computed with the \(\mathrm{CL_{s}}\) method [63; 64]. The expected 95% confidence level (CL) limit on \(\mathcal{B}(t\to uZ)\) and on \(\mathcal{B}(t\to cZ)\) are shown in Tables 6

The number of signal events is normalized to the expected branching ratio limits of \(\mathcal{B}(t\to uZ)=4.6\times 10^{-5}\) and \(\mathcal{B}(t\to cZ)=5.5\times 10^{-5}\). Total systematic uncertainties are shown before (after) the combined fit under the background-only hypothesis. After the combined fit, the uncertainty on the total background is smaller than the uncertainty on some of the background contributions due to the negative correlations between some of the background sources.

and 7, which include the contribution from the statistical and systematic uncertainties. The latter one does not include contribution from the MC statistical uncertainty, which given the small size of some of the simulated event samples (\(Z\)+jets, for instance) is more realistic than the former one.

Inclusion of the CRs in the combined fit with the SR constrains backgrounds, reduces systematic uncertainties and thus improves the \(\mathcal{B}(t\to qZ)\) limits. The limits obtained without inclusion of the CRs in the likelihood are about 13% worse compared to the results extracted from the CRs and SR combination. After the combined fit, the dominant contributions to systematic uncertainties come from \(E_{\text{T}}^{\text{miss}}\) and jet reconstruction uncertainties. The effect of these uncertainties is estimated in the 13 \(\mathrm{\text{Te\kern-1.0ptV}}\) analysis and the same uncertainties are applied in the HL-LHC studies. If the expected improvements for these sources of systematic uncertainties are taken into account by reducing their effect by a factor of two [62], a further improvement of about 15% on the \(\mathcal{B}(t\to qZ)\) limits is to be expected.

For comparison, an extrapolation of the 13 \(\mathrm{\text{Te\kern-1.0ptV}}\) analysis [24] is performed yielding the branching ratio limits of \(\mathcal{B}(t\to uZ)<1.0\times 10^{-4}\) and \(\mathcal{B}(t\to cZ)<1.4\times 10^{-4}\). These results are about factor two worse than the ones derived from the HL-LHC samples since the extrapolation approach does not incorporate other changes besides the cross-sections and integrated luminosity, such as the changes in the detector geometry or resolutions, or expected improvements in the estimation of uncertainties.

The limits on the branching ratios can be interpreted in the framework of an Effective Field Theory (EFT) approach, see for example Refs. [46; 47]. In this context limits can be set on the EFT coefficients. According to Ref. [47], the EFT operators to which the analysis is more sensitive are \(C_{uB}^{(31)}\), \(C_{uW}^{(31)}\), \(C_{uB}^{(32)}\) and \(C_{uW}^{(32)}\). Assuming a cut-off scale \(\Lambda=1\)\(\mathrm{\text{Te\kern-1.0ptV}}\) and that only one FCNC mode contributes, the branching ratio limits presented in Table 7 are converted to 95% CL upper limits on the moduli of the EFT coefficients. These are shown in Table 8. The results of this analysis should not depend of the handedness of the EFT couplings [65].

## 7 Conclusion

The sensitivity of the ATLAS experiment in the search for flavour-changing neutral-current top quark decays is presented. The study is performed in the context of the high luminosity phase of the Large Hadron Collider with a centre-of-mass energy of 14 TeV and an integrated luminosity of 3000 fb\({}^{-1}\). The three charged lepton final state of \(t\bar{t}\) events is considered, in which one of the top quarks decays through the \(t\to qZ\) (\(q=u,c\)) flavour-changing neutral-current channel and the other one decays to \(bW\) (\(t\bar{t}\to bWqZ\to b\ell\nu q\ell\ell\)). An improvement by a factor of four is expected over the current Run-2 analysis results of \(\mathcal{B}(t\to uZ)<1.7\times 10^{-4}\) and \(\mathcal{B}(t\to cZ)<2.4\times 10^{-4}\) with 36.1 fb\({}^{-1}\) integrated luminosity. The branching ratio limits that are obtained are at the level of 4 to \(5\times 10^{-5}\) depending on the considered scenarios for the systematic uncertainties.
