###### Abstract

This document aims to summarize the performance specifications of the proposed Inner Tracker (ID) for the ATLAS Phase II Upgrade. The performance requirements will be justified by the physics requirements for Phase II, and will provide a guideline for the layout of the ID.

## 1 Introduction

This document aims to summarize the performance specifications of the proposed Inner Tracker (ID) for the ATLAS Phase II Upgrade. The performance requirements will be justified by the physics requirements for Phase II, and will provide a guideline for the layout of the ID.

In addition to the performance requirements, some basic assumptions are made on the tracker layout to enable convergence to a practical design: the total and active envelope, the material budget and the location of passive services etc. Other constraints concern the expected integrated fluence, and the constraints imposed by activation near the beam-pipe. These constraints are listed and discussed in Section 2.

It is assumed that the tracker should survive HL-LHC operating conditions corresponding to an integrated luminosity of L\({}_{\mathrm{int}}\) \(\sim\)3000 fb-1, with peak luminosities reaching L\({}_{\mathrm{peak}}\)\(\sim\)7 x 10\({}^{34}\) cm-2s-1 (L\({}_{\mathrm{peak}}\)\(\sim\)5 x 10\({}^{34}\) cm-2s-1 after leveling) This implies that (assuming 25 ns bunch spacing) the tracker performance should be maintained for beam-beam interactions with a mean pile-up of \(\sim\)200 (140) events (maximum \(\sim\)230 pile-up events).

In Section 3, we show the so-called Utopia layout [1], which is being used as a benchmark for many simulations (for example occupancies). This is included to allow comparison with possible new or evolved pixel and strip layouts (e.g. barrel length, strip pitch, etc, novel pixel layouts, etc).

Sections 4-9 then describe the expected performance specifications.

Finally, two open questions may have significant consequences on the layout:

* The possibility that a self-seeded level-1 track trigger will be required to meet the planned trigger performance.
* This note implicitly assumes that the tracker will be constructed from a combination of semi-conductor pixel and micro-strip layers (modules): if other technologies are chosen, this will influence the tracker layout.

Future versions of this note will take this into account.

## 2 Constraints Imposed by the Existing ATLAS Detector and the LHC

It is currently assumed that the longitudinal beam spot will be of length \(\sigma\)=75 mm, and that full coverage is assured in a 2\(\sigma\) range about the mean [2]. The LHC can adapt the longitudinal beam spot to that required by the experiments, but with some preference to larger values in order to separate primary interaction vertices.

It is currently assumed that the minimum internal radius for the beam pipe will be R=29mm, to be compared with the 25 mm beam pipe for phase 0 (IBL). This implies an inner pixel envelope, taking account of insulation material and the necessity to bake out the beam pipe etc., of _at least_ R=35 mm and a minimal active pixel radius of \(\sim\)37 mm. A larger beam pipe radius would have a consequence on the r-f granularity of the innermost pixel layer, to maintain the transverse vertex accuracy.

The existing solenoid cryostat wall is at radius R=1153 mm. Taking into account new moderator material (50 mm) which is required in the absence of the TRT, the Outer Tracker Cylinder (45 mm including the thermal and gas enclosures) and other engineering constraints, the inner barrel envelope is currently constrained to R=1033 mm. The last active layer is R \(\sim\)1000 mm. Beyond the barrel-endcap interface, existing constraints on the barrel service routing result in a maximum passive envelope of R =1027 mm and R\(\sim\)960 mm when forward services are included. The outer active radius for silicon sensors in this region is R \(\sim\)950 mm (subject to detailed engineering).

Service constraints mean the silicon endcap disk (or equivalent) should not exceed z \(\sim\)2900 mm, if it is to be in the thermal and gas enclosure. The gas enclosure is at z \(\sim\) 3110 mm

Table 1 summarizes the passive and active envelopes of the detector.

Three _engineering considerations_ that may influence the layout are:

* The full ATLAS tracking detector (excluding removable layers) will be assembled and commissioned on the surface, before installation as a single unit in ATLAS. To reduce material, there will be a single gas and thermal enclosure.
* Removable pixel layers (see below) should be designed in a clam-shell structure within an Inner Support Tube (IST), to enable easy removal in a short time period (hours). It is currently assumed that these layers will be split at z=0 to ease the removal of services. This constraint is introduced because of the expected activation around the beam pipe,

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|l l|l|} \hline
**Item** & & Radial extension (mm) \\ \hline
**Pixels** & _Approximate_ passive envelope & 35 \(<\) R \\  & _Approximate_ active envelope & 37 \(<\) R \\  & (there is no strong z-constraint) & \\
**Microstrip** & Passive envelope barrel & R \(<\) 1033 \\  & endcap & R \(<\) 960 \\  & Approximate active envelope barrel & R \(<\) 1000 \\  & Endcap & R \(<\) 950 \\  & Passive longitudinal envelope & \(|\)z\(|\) \(<\) 3110 \\  & Active & \(|\)z\(|\) \(<\) \(\sim\)2900 \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 1: Approximate active and passive radial envelopes for the ID. The detailed envelopes will be dictated by the layout design decisions and by engineering constraints. The transition between pixel and microstrip will be optimized on the basis of cost and performance. The transition between microstrip barrel and endcap regions will be optimized on the basis of performance.

and the necessity to replace some layers following radiation damage. There is no constraint on the number of removable layers.
3. In the case of a pixel replacement in the Phase I shut-down, the constraint of the current Inner Support Tube may affect the layout. This is intentionally not further considered.

Four other _considerations_ possibly influencing the pixel layout are:

1. If the pixel detector is to be removed independently of the strip detector, the inner radial extension of the endcap disks should not hinder the pixel access.
2. The approximate expected fluence as a function of radius is shown in Section 3. The sensor lifetime is determined by the technology used, and the replacement of 1 or more layers is expected.
3. The outer radius if the pixel detector will be limited by cost. This note assumes a maximal active barrel pixel envelope of R \(\sim\)250-300 mm. The endcap radii will be optimized for performance.
4. At inner radii, very high activation levels may affect the construction details and consequent performance.

An additional criterion is to provide equal spacing of "space points" to the best possible extent. In particular, a major defect of the current ID is the lack of intermediate space points for tracks of \(|\eta|>2\), with space points in the pixel and end-cap disks.

## 3 The UTOPIA Layout

The benchmark Utopia layout is shown in Figure 1. This layout is currently being simulated using the GEANT4 and Athena analysis framework. The pixel and strip granularities are shown in Table 2 for convenience, but _may not_ be those of the optimized layout.

In the case of the Utopia layout - also an indication for other layouts - Figures 2 and 3 [4] show the integrated fluence (1 MeV n\({}_{\rm eq}\)) following an integrated luminosity of 3000 fb-1. The pixel sensor technology will be an important criterion for a decision on the number of removable "pixel hits".

## 4 Number of Silicon (Pixel and Strip) Hits

Figure 4 shows (for interest) the existing ATLAS Inner Detector, for a candidate Z event with 20 pile-up events. The Phase II tracker layout should maintain or improve on the performance of the existing tracker, with stable performance with respect to increasing pile-up, up to 200 event pile-up (Table 2).

* The initial benchmark for this is the \(\sim\)99% reconstruction efficiency for isolated high-p\({}_{\mathrm{T}}\) muon tracks (p\({}_{\mathrm{T}}\) > 3 GeV/c), in a pile-up environment of 140 and 200 superimposed events in the range \(|\eta|\) < 2.5.
* In high pile-up conditions, the pixel sub-system should be capable of track segment reconstruction (seeding) for subsequent extrapolation into the microstrip detector, exploiting the low occupancy of the pixel layers. The current optimal track finding strategy seeds the combinatorial Kalman Filter using combinations of 3 pixel space points. A 4th (and eventual 5th) low occupancy pixel layer is required [3] for robustness against eventual dead modules and to minimize the rate of fake accidental combinations. In addition several silicon microstrip hits are required (5 space-point hits are assumed in the case of Utopia). Back-tracking algorithms required for conversions and bremsstrahlung recovery need microstrip space points.

* To maintain the b-tagging and vertex reconstruction performance at the level of the Phase 0 (IBL) detector, the inner pixel hit (radial position and sensor granularity) must be adapted to achieve the performance goals (specifications are discussed below).
* To allow rapid alignment using tracks, special account must be made to avoid or minimize unconstrained weak alignment modes. Small module overlaps in Rphi (and Rz) strongly constrain the local module alignment and therefore enable a good control on the impact parameter resolution. Global deformations of the detector (weak modes) affect the momentum scale and require external information to be fully corrected. It is required that the residual systematics on the momentum scale after alignment should be less than 5% of the intrinsic momentum resolution over the full \(|\eta|\)-\(\phi\) coverage.

Figure 4: _Candidate Z boson event with 20 reconstructed vertices. For this display the track p\({}_{T}\) threshold is 0.4 GeV and all tracks are required to have at least 2 Pixel and 7 SCT hits. The vertices shown are reconstructed using tracks with p\({}_{T}\) greater than 0.4 GeV._To confirm forward muons in the range 2.5 < \(|\eta|\) < 2.7 reconstructed in the muon spectrometer and its assignment to the (externally) identified primary vertex. This is tentatively interpreted as requiring at least 3 pixel hits in the range 2.5 < \(|\eta|\) < 2.7, permitting a z resolution at the level of mm.
* The extrapolation accuracy of reconstructed tracks into the EM calorimeter should be consistent with the calorimeter centroid precision in both the bending and non-bending planes.

## 5 High-\(\mathrm{p_{T}}\) Track Reconstruction and Momentum Resolution

The resolution of a track parameter \(X\) can be expressed as a function of \(\mathrm{p_{T}}\) as:

\(\sigma_{x}(p_{T})=\sigma_{x}(\infty)(1)\oplus p_{X}/p_{T})\)

where \(\mathrm{p_{X}}\) is a constant representing the value of \(\mathrm{p_{T}}\) for which intrinsic and multiple scattering terms are equal for the parameter \(X\) under consideration. In the case of \(\mathrm{p_{T}}\), the specification [5] was:

* \(\sigma_{v_{lp_{T}}}(\infty)<0.30\)\(\mathrm{TeV^{-1}}\) for \(|\eta|<2\) and \(\sigma_{v_{lp_{T}}}(\infty)<0.50\)\(\mathrm{TeV^{-1}}\) for \(|\eta|=2.5\) because of the reduced solenoidal field integral at large \(|\eta|\).

This specification was not achieved for the existing tracker [7] (Figure 5):

* \(\sigma_{v_{lp_{T}}}(\infty)=0.34\)\(\mathrm{TeV^{-1}}\) for \(|\eta|<0.5\), \(\sigma_{v_{lp_{T}}}(\infty)=0.41\)\(\mathrm{TeV^{-1}}\) for \(1.5<|\eta|<1.75\) and \(\sigma_{v_{lp_{T}}}(\infty)\) > 1\(\mathrm{TeV^{-1}}\) if \(|\eta|>2\).

The physics reasons for this specification are well justified in [6], and every effort should be made to maintain or improve the specification in the upgraded ID, extending the lower limit as far in \(|\eta|\) as possible.

The performance of track reconstruction for muons at high \(\mathrm{p_{T}}\) is determined by the _detector granularity_ in the bending and non-bending planes, and the efficiency of track reconstruction at high \(\mathrm{p_{T}}\) should be close to 100%, even in the case of maximum pile-up. The material budget inside the tracker acceptance, in particular from services, drives the tracking efficiency for hadrons and electrons, as well as the resolution for all parameters and particle types below \(\mathrm{p_{T}}\) \(\sim\) 50 GeV.

However, passive material outside the detector acceptance (for example services along the beam pipe as in the IBL) will also affect the detector occupancy; the preferred service routing and patch panel placements should be carefully studied to reduce the physics impact (see Section 6).

Figure 5: Relative transverse momentum resolution for high-\(\mathrm{p_{T}}\) muons expected for the as-built ATLAS ID. From Figure 4, ref [7].

The reconstructed centroid of electromagnetic calorimeter clusters is energy and \(|\eta|\) dependent [8]. The achievable asymptotic precision for high-Er photons is approximately as in Table 3 below. Also shown in Figure 6[9] is the track-calorimeter resolution for high-energy electrons from W and Z decay. The track impact precision should be compatible with the calorimeter precision, and for precision measurements allow accurate bremsstrahlung recovery [9]. There are also track-matching requirements from algorithms for combined muon tracking (MulD like algorithm).

Finally, the electron or muon track isolation requirements from physics analysis need to be studied, possibly affecting the track trigger strategy.

In Table 4, the expected asymptotic performance of the existing tracking detector, including the IBL, is shown for the major track parameters, in the central region (the region of lowest material). Also shown are the specifications aimed at for the upgraded ID, with 200 overlapping events.

* Detector Occupancy The detector occupancy due to instrumental reasons is dominantly due to the detector and electronics noise (micro-strips) and variations of the pixel thresholds (pixels). The expected occupancy after irradiation corresponding to 3000 fb-1, is expected to be < 10\({}^{\circ}\) (micro-strips) and < 10\({}^{\circ}\) (pixels), to be verified, in particular for pixels following activation. These occupancies should be negligible compared with the expected collision occupancy, with high pile-up. The occupancy should be low and should not result in significant mis-measurements of reconstructed tracks. High detector occupancies result in an increased rate of fake track combinations and shared clusters. This limits the b-tagging performance and impact precision for pixel layers1. For the microstrip layers, it may result in an increased rate of fake tracks and high p\({}_{\rm T}\) tails due to wrong hit associations. Using the granularities quoted above, the measured in-time occupancies for the UTOPIA layout [1] are listed in Table 5

Experience with the existing detector indicates that previous occupancy benchmarks of 1% (strips) and 0.1% (pixels) are pessimistic. Nevertheless, the quoted UTOPIA occupancies are marginal.

As noted in Section 4, the high \(\mathrm{p_{T}}\) muon track reconstruction efficiency should be \(\sim\) 99% in the range 0 < \(|\eta|\) < 2.5, assuming 200 pile-up events. The measured rate of badly

The requirements on track precision at the calorimeter entrance are determined from Table 3.

measured tracks because of shared or mis-assigned hits should be low. At this stage, no specification is given. The charge misidentification rate for high \(\mathrm{p_{T}}\) muons is expected to be limited by residual weak modes in the detector alignment, especially at high \(|\eta|\). Assuming 200 pile-up events, tails of \(>\)3\(\sigma\) in the high- \(\mathrm{p_{T}^{\prime}}\) momentum resolution due to mis-measurements should not exceed 1% and therefore not contribute significantly to the charge mis-identification of \(Z\rightarrow\mu^{*}\mu^{-}\) events. The target reconstruction efficienciy for muons of \(\mathrm{p_{T}}>5\) GeV/c is given in Table 6, for 200 pile-up events. For convenience, the target reconstruction efficiencies for charged pions and electrons of \(\mathrm{p_{T}}>5\) GeV/c are also listed (see Section 6). **c) Detector Alignment and Requirements on Mechanical Stability** The detector alignment should be achievable using collision and cosmic ray tracks, and care should be taken in the layout to ensure that unconstrained weak alignment modes are minimized (specification to be determined). Experience of the present detector has shown that long-term stability is excellent, excepting: changes of the cooling status; changes of the solenoid status; and changes of the toroid status. In particular, the relative alignment of the barrel and end caps is susceptible to these changes (a 5um misalignment will introduce an approximate 1% bias in \(\mathrm{\delta p_{T}/p_{T}}\) for \(Z\to e^{+}e^{-}e^{-}\) events). At constant cooling conditions, the detector should remain stable at the level of \(\leq\) 2-3 \(\mathrm{\SIUnitSymbolMicro m}\), independent of the readout status.

## 6 Effect of Material Budget

The amount and location of material in the detector is of utmost important to the detector performance for pions, electrons and photons. The material influences the reconstruction efficiency, the momentum resolution and the rate of fake tracks. The goal is to improve by 30% (possibly 50%) on the multiple scattering terms compared to the current detector.

While the material from the active detector elements is important, the dominant material effect is due to services. The effect of passive service material (cables, connection boxes etc) is of 2 types:

- Material within the active detector acceptance that results in conversions, bremsstrahlung, etc.,

- Material outside the detector acceptance (for example along the beam pipe) that results in secondaries and conversions that subsequently enter the detector acceptance.

In each case, the secondary tracks are not associated to the primary vertex, excepting possibly the inner pixel layers.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|} \hline
**Target track reconstruction** & \\
**efficiency (200 events pileup)** & \\ \hline \(\mu^{e}\) & \(\sim\) 99\% \\ \hline \(\pi^{e}\) & \(|\eta|\leq\) 1.0 & \(>\) 95\% \\ \hline \(\pi^{e}\) & \(|\eta|>\) 1.0 & \(>\) 90\% \\ \hline \(e^{e}\) & \(|\eta|\leq\) 1.0 & \(>\) 85\% \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 6: Target reconstruction efficiencies for \(\mu^{e}\), \(\pi^{e}\) and \(e^{+}\) particles of \(\mathrm{p_{T}}>5\) GeV/c. The target efficiency in the forward direction for reconstructed \(e^{+}\) should not be significantly degraded with respect to the central region.

R&D studies, as well as prototype studies for the IBL project, suggest that the following "active" material budgets are reasonable to specify (Table 7).

* \(\leq 2\%\) per layer including services and non-active support material for the pixel detector; i.e. a total of 0.1 X\({}_{0}\) at \(|\eta|=0\) for 5 layers, after averaging over the expected on-detector service increase with \(|\eta|\).
* If possible the first 2 pixel layers should be of less than this specification.
* \(\leq 2.5\%\) per layer including services and non-active support material for the double-sided micro-strip detector; i.e. a total of 0.125 X\({}_{0}\) at \(|\eta|=0\) for 5 layers, after averaging over the expected on-detector service increase with \(|\eta|\):
* In each case, the material distribution increases towards the "local support" end, because of increasing service material; this will depend on service choices but should be minimized compatible with robustness.

Figure 7 shows the measured material budget for the existing ATLAS ID [7] (without the IBL layer). The following remarks can be made:

* The material budget in the central region (0 < \(|\eta|<0.5\)) is within the design specification of 0.3 X\({}_{0}\), in the absence of the Transition Radiation Tracker (TRT). Beyond that small region, services are the important contribution to the material budget.
* The material budget should be minimized at all \(|\eta|\), subject to engineering constraints and the maintaining of other performance requirements (# hits, stability, alignment, electrical robustness, etc.).

Practical construction specifications for the upgraded tracker impose at best:

* A specification of \(\leq\)0.1 X\({}_{0}\) for the pixel detector in the active central region, and the minimization of services at the largest possible \(|\eta|\).
* A specification of \(\leq\)0.125 X\({}_{0}\) for the semi-conductor micro-strip detector in the active central region, and the minimization of services at the largest possible \(|\eta|\).
* Massive connection patch-panels outside the detector volume

The "non-active" services should be minimized, where reasonable with non-active services routed outside the detector acceptance. For example, the current Pixel PP0 which gives rise to a large rate of fake high p\({}_{\rm T}\) tracks in reconstruction due to hadronic interactions. However,

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|} \hline
**Material Budget** & Radiation Length (X\({}_{0}\)) \\
**Benchmark** & \\ \hline Pixel layer or disk & \(<0.02\) \\ \hline Strip layer or disk & \(<0.025\) \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}

Figure 7: Material budget in (a) X\({}_{0}\) and (b) \(\lambda_{0}\) for the existing ATLAS ID.

simulation studies and material comparisons are needed to establish the optimal service routing, compatible with engineering, construction and QA constraints.

#### a) Efficiency for electron and pion reconstruction and identification

Assuming a 200 event minimum bias pile-up with the track tuning developed for those conditions, the reconstruction efficiency should exceed 95% in the barrel and 90% in the forward regions (\(|\eta|>1\)), for pions of \(\mathrm{p_{T}}\)\(>5\) GeV/c (see Table 6).

For identified electrons (\(\mathrm{p_{T}}\)\(>5\) GeV/c) using the tuning appropriate to those conditions and after bremsstrahlung recovery, the track reconstruction efficiency should exceed 85% in the central region with only a small degradation beyond \(|\eta|=1\) (see Table 6). Isolation criteria are likely to be required to ensure adequate rejection of fakes.

#### b) Robustness

The track reconstruction efficiency and track mis-measurement should not be significantly deteriorated in the presence of 10% dead channels, or 10% dead modules, randomly distributed in the detector volume. The efficiency should be robust with respect to detector gaps (gap line-ups should be avoided) and the aligning of dead areas in successive hits for a region of (\(\eta\),\(\phi\)), for example because of readout issues.

#### c) Tracking in high \(\mathrm{E_{T}}\) jets and 3-prong \(\pi\) decays

The track reconstruction and b-tag performance in high \(\mathrm{E_{T}}\) jets is limited by the 2-track resolution in the inner pixel and microstrip layers, because of cluster merging and subsequent track finding problems. The \(\phi\)- and z-granularity of the innermost pixel layers must be optimized to maximize the light jet rejection for 150 GeV jets. The strip layout should be optimized to minimize the hit sharing in the core of those jets, taking into account the effect of an eventual 5th pixel layer.

## 7 Vertex Reconstruction

As noted above, the 2\(\alpha\) limits of the z-vertex distribution are currently \(\pm\)150 mm (Section 2). With a 200-event pile-up, the mean separation of primary vertices is typically \(<1\) mm. It is unlikely that all vertices of a selected event with pile-up will be reconstructed. Rather, it is likely that high \(\mathrm{p_{T}}\) objects (\(\mu^{\mathrm{t}}\), \(\mathrm{e^{t}}\), tracks of a high \(\mathrm{E_{T}}\) hadronic jet) will be associated to a vertex. The vertex reconstruction in such an environment poses stringent requirements on the z (and \(\mathrm{d_{d}}\)) impact parameter resolution for all tracks and hence requires to minimize the material of the innermost pixel layers, especially at larger \(|\eta|\), as well as the granularity of the inner pixel layer.

In the presence of 200 pile-up events, the current ATLAS performance for the primary vertex reconstruction and identification efficiency should be maintained. This is reflected by the following requirements in the case of \(\tilde{t^{\prime}}\) production:

- \(\varepsilon>\)97% that the \(\tilde{t^{\prime}}\) primary vertex is among the reconstructed primary vertices;

- \(\varepsilon>\)97% that the \(\tilde{t^{\prime}}\) primary vertex is correctly identified.

## 8 b-Tagging

The b-tagging performance at 200 pile-up events for tagging algorithms optimized for the layout, should match the performance of existing combined taggers (e.g. IP3D+SV1 and JetFitterNNComb) for the current detector with IBL at 50 pile-up events. This implies that the specifications of Table 4 and Section 6c are maintained.

Trigger Requirements.

Ongoing studies indicate that Level-1 trigger rates for inclusive electron or muon signatures will exceed the maximum Level-1 acceptance rate of 100 KHz [12]. This remains to be confirmed.

The additional rejection rate obtained by associating a high \(\mathrm{p_{T}}\) track with the electron or muon trigger signals is expected to be \(\sim\)100. This also needs confirmation.

Two technical implementations of such a trigger are currently being evaluated:

* The addition of a Level-0 signal to allow the fast readout of the track information in a region-of-interest to a FTK-like trigger external to the detector. Because of a limited latency of 10 \(\mathrm{\SIUnitSymbolMicro s}\) imposed by the muon trigger electronics, a fast readout link is likely to be required. There would be no other layout implication.
* The construction of self-seeded trigger planes using either axial silicon pairs [13] or a dedicated gaseous (GASPIX) detector [14]. This option will have significant consequences for the detector layout, especially in the forward direction.

For what concerns this requirements document, the following specification is needed:

* The required efficiency, acceptance and rejection for inclusive electron and muon triggers at a nominal \(\mathrm{p_{T}}\) threshold. Any trigger implementation should demonstrate an efficient turn-on, and a stable trigger (\(\mathrm{\SIUnitSymbolMicro s}\),\(\mathrm{\SIUnitSymbolMicro s}\)) efficiency in the range 0 \(<|\eta|<2.5\).
* The impact of a Level-1 track trigger on the reconstruction performance of tracking detector should be small.
* The additional material resulting from 1 or more trigger layers should be minimal.

The requirements of any Level-1 trigger implementation will evolve in future versions of this document.

* [2] Information to M. Nessi from LHC machine group. The nominal beam length will be unchanged from the existing specification (\(\mathrm{\SIUnitSymbolMicro s}\)\(\sim\)55 mm) but can be adjusted according to experimental requirements. The assumption of a \(\mathrm{\SIUnitSymbolMicro s}\) = 75 mm beam length accounts for a possible preference to increase the primary vertex separation at high luminosity.
