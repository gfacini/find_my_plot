pointing inside the TRD aperture. This typically left us with 30% to 60% of the initial sample depending on the beam width.

In figs. 2 and 3, we plot the total calorimeter energy distributions and preshower signals after this initial selection of clean beam events. In the total energy distributions for electrons one can see the contribution from pion contamination. The pion contamination is also evident in the preshower signal where on average 4% of the events have no energy deposition.

Figure 4 shows the TR-cluster distributions in the TRD/tracker. TR-clusters are defined as energy depositions above 5.5 KeV in straws along a reconstructed particle track. The difference between electrons and pions is of course sufficient to separate them cleanly even for 60 GeV pions, which are observed to produce some transition radiation.

The charged hadron beam consisted dominantly of \(\pi^{+}\), but also contained an unknown fraction of protons, expected to be smaller than \(\sim 10\%\) at the chosen beam energies. This tertiary hadron beam also contained \(\sim 2\%\) of electrons, which were rejected using a dedicated trigger setup for this study: a 7 mm lead block was installed in front of two scintillation counters, which were both required to give a pulse height compatible with a single minimum ionising particle in the trigger. The rejection of electrons obtained with this trigger was studied with the tertiary electron beam of 30 GeV and measured (using the TRD) to be \(\sim 1000\). We therefore conclude that the electron contamination in the 30 GeV pion beam was \(\sim 0.002\%\).

In order to estimate the electron efficiency of the calorimeter cuts discussed below, it was also important to eliminate the pions present in the electron beam. This was performed requiring a minimum number of 7 TR-clusters on the candidate 'electron' track. In addition a very loose cut (marked by the arrows in fig. 2) was applied on the total electromagnetic energy observed in the calorimeter. The remaining events constituted the final electron sample. Using the cluster distributions shown in fig. 4, the remaining pion contamination in the 30 GeV electron beam is estimated to be less than 0.04%.

## 3 Energy calibration

After the initial event selection described above, we proceeded to reconstruct the incident electron energy. For these measurements our pedestals and gains were found to be different from previously measured pedestals in RD3, probably due to different gating electronics. We therefore measured our pedestals using a special trigger which was taken outside the beam and used to calibrate the TRD. In Table 1 we give some representative values of RD3 (run 4172) and RD6 pedestals for a few channels. Analysis of reconstructed showers demonstrated that even our pedestals are somewhat higher than the real ones (by about 100 MeV or 3 ADC counts per cell). As will be shown below, this affects the energy scale but not the energy resolution nor the hadron rejection.

For each of the three available beam energies we defined the electron energy as:

\[E_{measured}=E_{3\times 3}+E_{presh},\]

where \(E_{3\times 3}\) is the energy seen in a matrix of \(3\times 3\) cells around the impact cell, and \(E_{presh}\) is the product of the total energy registered in the preshower and of a weight, \(w\), which we determined by minimising the electron energy resolution. The results of this minimisation are given in Table 2.

In order to get an estimate of the average residual pedestal and correct the energy scale we made a straight line fit to our three available energies (fig. 5), from which we found

\[E_{corr}=(E_{measured}+1.454)/0.708\]

The corrected preshower energy, \(E_{presh}\), shown in fig. 6 is somewhat smaller than that measured by RD3. This is probably due to the residual pedestal effect mentioned above, which we do not know how to attribute to the various compartments per cell. As expected for such effects, the discrepancy is largest at the lowest energy. The electron energy resolution obtained with these RD6 data is compared to published RD3 data in fig. 7. Our results are slightly worse but this effect can be entirely attributed to the magnetic field, since data taken at 20 GeV without field can be seen to yield an energy resolution perfectly compatible with that of RD3. Though the magnetic field in the test beam was much weaker than that foreseen in ATLAS, it's impact on the measurement is quite large because of the distance between the detector material in the field and the calorimeter (more than one metre). This affects the energy measurement for electrons but not for pions.

least partially be attributed to the different setups used. We also investigated whether the preshower rejection depends on the layer position. Figure 15 shows the pion efficiency versus electron inefficiency, for 20 GeV energy pions from Monte-Carlo, using either only the first preshower layer or both layers. For an electron efficiency of 90%, the preshower rejection is expected to be \(\sim 2\), using the first layer, and to increase to \(\sim 2.5\) with both layers. Figure 15 also shows the result obtained in the test beam for both layers.

Fig. 16 shows finally shows the combined efficiencies of the calorimeter and preshower cuts, for both electron and pion data, as a function of the beam energy (see also Tables 3 and 5). As mentioned above, these results, obtained in the presence of a magnetic field, yield a pion rejection worse than that expected from many previous measurements without magnetic field. The pion rejection increases from \(\sim 150\) at 20 to 30 GeV to \(\sim 500\) at 60 GeV.

As a check, the distributions of the number of transition radiation clusters found on the tracks for the surviving events are plotted in fig. 17, showing that the remaining pions are not contaminated by electrons, as expected from the discussion in Section 2.

## 5 Conclusions

This study shows that the simulation results, presented in the hadronic jet study of [2], where possible high-\(p_{T}\) hadron backgrounds to electron signals were investigated for transverse momenta around 20 GeV, are compatible with test beam data using an experimental setup close to the ATLAS detector in the barrel region.

The overall calorimeter and preshower rejection against pions is measured to increase from \(\sim 150\) at 20 GeV to \(\sim 500\) at 60 GeV, using cuts which are not overly sensitive to bremsstrahlung and pile-up effects. We conclude that, for \(p_{T}\sim 20\) GeV at central rapidities, the presence of a TRD detector would indeed improve the electron identification in ATLAS. The desired rejection of \(\sim 1000\) could thus be achieved over the desired energy range, by combining calorimeter, preshower and TRD information. In particular, we believe that, at initial low luminosities, a clean inclusive electron sample would be useful to understand in detail the quality of the ATLAS E/p measurement and therefore the calibration of the electromagnetic calorimeter and of the momentum measurement. In addition, it would allow us to possibly use non-isolated electrons from b-decay for physics. This topic clearly deserves further study.
