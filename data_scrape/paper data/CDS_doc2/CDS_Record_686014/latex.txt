Figure 7: Amplitude spectra of the observed signal from the straw tube, if the X-ray beam irradiates the wire (left-hand plots) and if the X-ray beam only irradiates the gas (right-hand plots). The top plot corresponds to the general situation when the X-ray beam and the wire projection were not perfectly parallel. The bottom plot corresponds to the best case when the X-ray beam was almost perfectly parallel to the wire projection and the width of the X-ray beam was therefore equal to the wire diameter.
