Introduction

Aim of the document is the definition of a common set of guidelines and test procedures for commissioning the MDT chambers. Almost all of them are produced, and most are already equipped with gas and electrical services. Some are being tested under cosmic rays in the production sites, while others are being equipped and integrated now at CERN, and must be completely tested. All chambers, sooner or later, must be transported to CERN, where they have to be commissioned. Commissioning is the series of tests required in order to certify single chambers ready for installation (RFI).

Commissioning is different for Barrel and Endcap chambers. The former will be tested at a single chamber level before going to the ATLAS pit, ready for the last quick test before final installation, while the latter will be first tested at a single chamber level (phase one), then installed into the Small and Big Wheel sectors (SW and BW), tested after the integration (phase two) and transported to the ATLAS pit for final wheel installation.

The present document concerns all tests, including those of phase two for Endcap chambers, but it is possible that some specific tests, at the moment not planned, will be implemented during the Endcap phase two commissioning. It is composed of three sections:

1 - Guidelines for checking chamber conformity, where the main rules for declaring that chambers conform to the reference drawings and requirements are described;

2 - Commissioning tests, where the minimal required tests, and their procedures, are detailed;

3 - Database information, where the database structure and the minimal required information to be stored into it are illustrated and listed.

## 2 Guidelines for checking chamber conformity

Before commissioning, chambers must be checked for their conformity to all requirements and reference drawings. Here, the major checks that every construction group has to perform in order to proceed to commission chambers are listed.

### Layout

**1** - Chamber must comply with the envelope defined by ATLAS Technical Coordination (TC). Every part of it must not exceed envelope, unless a specific request of modification was sent to Olga Beltramello and accepted by her. The final envelope of each chamber type should be made available on drawing to the TC and to the MDT collaboration, so to make possible to them further checks;

**2** - All official barcode labels must be attached to chambers, in accessible and visible places, not covered by cables, gas pipes, electronics services or any other thing that can make difficult scanning them. Old official barcodes, not always readable, must be replaced with the new ones;

**3** - All chamber and services parts must be diamagnetic. They must be checked before starting commissioning, and magnetic parts must be replaced before installation. Magnetic parts can only be accepted if there is no technical possibility of replacing them. Examples of magnetic parts not replaceable are I/O connectors of RasMuxes and ELMBs and precision positioning pins of the axial/praxial platforms. Each group must inform TC about any magnetic piece not replaceable.

### Alignment

**1** - All alignment platforms must be glued in proper position. For Barrel chambers, reference drawings can be found at

[https://edms.cern.ch/cdd/plsql/c4w_atlas_guided_search?cookie=718238&p_c_id=1048829168&p](https://edms.cern.ch/cdd/plsql/c4w_atlas_guided_search?cookie=718238&p_c_id=1048829168&p).

project code=ATL

under ATLAMAM: MDT Alignment Systems. Tooling for gluing platforms can be found at the same web address, under ATLMAG: Positioning Tools (Platform gluing).

For Endcap chambers, reference drawings of alignment system, B sensors and survey targets are at [http://www.hep.brandeis.edu/ddb/](http://www.hep.brandeis.edu/ddb/)

General descriptions of the layouts of Barrel and Endcap alignment systems can be found at

[http://atlas.web.cern.ch/Atlas/GROUPS/MUON/alignment/muon_align.html](http://atlas.web.cern.ch/Atlas/GROUPS/MUON/alignment/muon_align.html).

**2** - Platforms must be properly glued, in order to avoid possible falls when chambers are installed. Gluing procedures for Barrel Projective and Reference platforms can be found at

[http://www.pv.infn.it/~servel/atlas/commissioning/index.html](http://www.pv.infn.it/~servel/atlas/commissioning/index.html);

For Endcap chambers, some documentation can be found at

[http://ganesh.physics.lsa.umich.edu/~atlas/integration/drawings/drawings.html](http://ganesh.physics.lsa.umich.edu/~atlas/integration/drawings/drawings.html);

**3 -** RasCams of the in-plane system must be electrically insulated from the crossplate to which they are mounted. Each chamber must be checked for this. Short-circuits, if not recoverable, must be marked and reported to the TC;

**4 -** RasCams, lenses and masks must be rigidly connected to the crossplates. In order to improve their stability, it is recommended to glued them on the crossplates;

**5 -** Endcap, BOS and BOG chambers have survey targets. These are installed at the positions specified in the Brandeis drawings, for Endcap, and in the Saclay drawings, for Barrel. Positions after gluing are checked, and any deviation outside allowed tolerances is recorded in the database.

### Services

**1 -** On-chamber gas pipes must be referred to chamber ground, so to avoid EMI pick-up due to antenna affect. Connections to the gas main system must be insulated from chamber ground, in order to avoid ground loops out of control. Every chamber must be checked for this, and bad connections must be fixed before commissioning;

**2 -** Valves connected to the on-chamber gas pipes should be certified (by CERN, ask F. Hahn or S. Palestini) to be silicon and lubricant free. Grease inside valves is allowed, if certified by CMS or ATLAS (Pedro Canada or Apiezon). Not certified valves can still be used, but only at the chamber outlets, and no gas should flow through them to the chamber, in order to avoid contaminants transported by gas to the chamber internal. In any case, not certified valves must be dismounted before installation.

It is recommended that all chambers are equipped with valves, in order to keep them under pressure before and after commissioning. For chambers not yet equipped with safe valves, a proposal concerning the use of commercial valves available at the CERN Store was circulated by S. Palestini and L. Pontecorvo, and is reported in Appendix 2.

**3 -** On Barrel, HV splitter enclosure must be connected to chamber ground, while on Endcap, it must be connected to the wheel structure. ELMB and RasMux (AMB for Endcap) enclosures must be insulated from chamber ground. CSM motherboard must be supported with metallic standoffs, so its ground is connected to the chamber ground.

### Cabling

**1** - All alignment, temperature and B sensor cables must be placed in the proper positions, and connected to RasMux (AMB for Endcap) and ELMB. RasMux connection positions for Barrel chambers are defined in the document RasMux cabling tables for all chambers, available at

[http://atlas.web.cern.ch/Atlas/GROUPS/MUON/alignment/muon](http://atlas.web.cern.ch/Atlas/GROUPS/MUON/alignment/muon) align.html.

ELMB connection positions are not defined, and must be established by each group, which has to record them.

AMB (Alignment Multiplexer from Brandeis) and temperature cabling for Endcap chambers are described at

[http://ganesh.physics.lsa.umich.edu/~atlas/integration/drawings/drawings.html](http://ganesh.physics.lsa.umich.edu/~atlas/integration/drawings/drawings.html).

**2** - All cables must be properly labeled on both sides. In particular, Barrel alignment labels must follow the defined rules, available at

[http://atlas.web.cern.ch/Atlas/GROUPS/MUON/alignment/muon](http://atlas.web.cern.ch/Atlas/GROUPS/MUON/alignment/muon) align.html

under Labeling scheme for alignment sensor cables;

**3** - All sensor cables must be tested for continuity and shorts before sensor installation;

**4** - Cable supports, trays, adhesives or any other plastic piece used for supporting cables must be halogen-free and radiation resistant. Cable supports must be fixed to chambers in a safe way, by means of screws or directly glued.

## 3 Commissioning tests

All MDTs under commissioning at CERN are supposed to have passed all tests done locally at the test sites. Generally, alignment, DCS and HV cabling should be performed locally, while RO cables could be connected after the integration with RPCs.

Chambers can be fully commissioned only if for each of them all electronics components are available and functional, and the related cables are properly connected. The following electronics components are needed:

* HV splitter
* ELMB
* CSM motherboard
* Rasmux (AMB for Endcap)If one or more of the above mentioned components are not available, chambers can be commissioned, but specific tests must be foreseen after the procurement of the missing pieces, in order to verify the correctness and functionality of the cable connections.

The necessary tests and compensations to be performed for certifying a chamber RFI (Ready For Installation) are listed in the following. For Barrel chambers, they should be done sequentially all together, while for Endcap chambers some of them are done in the first phase of commissioning, and others in the second phase, after having installed chambers in the BW and SW sectors. The chronological sequence depends on the setups and available hardware, so it can be different from site to site.

Barrel:

1 - alignment

2 - sag compensation

3 - T, B and alignment sensors

4 - gas leak, short and long term

5 - hedgehog card and wire continuity check

5 - undercut leak

6 - noise

7 - cosmic rays

Phase two :

1 - sag compensation

2 - alignment

3 - current leak

4 - B sensors

The here described Endcap commissioning refers to the tests performed on chambers at CERN. The Boston groups are doing a first phase commissioning in Boston, following a simplified procedure. A document describing Boston commissioning is available at:

[http://huhepl.harvard.edu/~marin/integration/integrated](http://huhepl.harvard.edu/~marin/integration/integrated) chambers/BMC Integration2.ppt

The document describing all tests performed by the US groups for Endcap phase one commissioning at CERN is reported in Appendix 3.

### Alignment

Axial/praxial and projective platform positions should be measured before sensor installation. In-plane system must be tested, and new zero-readings should be measured, in order to adjust the sag.

### Method of tests -

Positions of axial/praxial and projective platforms for Barrel chambers are measured by means of special tools built and maintained by Saclay. They are read-out by means of a standard RasMux unit, not belonging to the chamber under test. Hardware and software are provided by Saclay and Nikhef.

No platform position measurement is foreseen for Endcap chambers.

In-plane measurements for Barrel are done using the on-chamber RasMux unit. Software is provided by Saclay, and it should be tested once in order to be sure to get the same results as the RasNik software used to measure the zero-readings at the sites (IcaRas program gives different results depending on the program or library version).

The sag compensation needs the knowledge of the zero-readings. They are taken for all chambers during assembly on the marble table, but unpredictable movements of some elements of the in-plane system can change significantly the values. For this reason, new zero-readings should be taken during the in-plane test, in order to check the old values, but for chambers carrying RPCs this is very difficult or not possible, so for them (BM and BO) zero-readings should be taken before integration with RPCs. Particular care has to be taken when measuring zero-readings, in order to avoid biases due to gravitational chamber distortions.

Time necessary for all alignment measurements should be of the order of half a day.

For Endcap chambers, it is only necessary to obtain a valid RasNik image. Brandeis is developing tools for calibrating the PMO (Proximity) system.

### Action on failure -

In order to measure the platform positions, a free space of 15 cm (along Z) times 20 cm (along X) behind the platforms (on the X direction) is necessary. Axial/praxial measurement is mandatory for all Barrel chambers, while projective platforms were already measured after gluing, so they can be skipped if the needed space is not available.

There is no possible adjustment for platforms found out of position. The only requirement is to record the measured positions in the database.

If measurement fails, for both Barrel and Endcap chambers, the in-plane cabling and the related RasMux (AMB) channels must be checked, together with possible obstructions along the optical paths. If a RasCam (CCD) or a RasLed doesn't work anymore, it must be replaced, even if this invalidates the zero-readings.

### Sag compensation

Barrel chambers belonging to all sectors, apart 1 and 9, need to compensate the different gravitational sag between wires and tubes. In order to be performed, compensation requires readings of the in-plane system. Sag is compensated by means of four tension rods put close to the longbeams.

Chamber under compensation must be supported on its final supports, and not on a table, with multilayer 1 on bottom (for chambers of sectors 2, 3, 4, 6, 7 and 8), or on top (for chambers of sectors 10, 11, 12, 14, 15 and 16). The length of tension rods must be adjusted until the read-out values show that the chamber sag is equal to the calculated value for the wire sag. For all chambers other than the ones of sectors 5 and 13, the compensation must be corrected by the angle on the XY plane, \(22.5^{\circ}\) or \(45^{\circ}\).

Reference values for wire sag at different angles must be calculated and available before starting compensation. Compensation can be considered terminated when in-plane values are within 10 microns or better from reference values.

For Endcap chambers there is no sag compensation, due to their vertical position. However, there is an equivalent tension rod adjustment to straighten chambers when mounted on sectors. Adjustment is done to best reproduce the zero-readings. Details on how to do this adjustment have to be still agreed upon by the Endcap groups.

**Action on failure -** Compensation is an iterative process, and can be very time consuming. If read-out values are unable to go closer than 10 microns from reference values, compensation should be terminated in any case after a reasonable number of attempts.

### T, B and alignment sensors

All on-chamber sensors must be tested. T and B sensors are connected to the ELMB, while all alignment sensors are connected to the RasMux (AMB for Endcap).

**Method of tests -** ELMB is acquired by means of a PC CANBus interface board, already available to all commissioning sites. B sensors are already tested and calibrated at CERN. In order to check their functionality, measurement should be done putting a small magnet in front of them, so that to avoid zero readings ambiguity. When B sensors are tested, their ID number and locations must be recorded.

Alignment sensors for Barrel are individually tested and calibrated by Saclay, but on-chamber test requires special tools. For some sensors, for example BIM-BIR connection, testing beforeinstallation is very complicated. It has to be understood whether the test is feasible during the commissioning phase, or if it could be simpler during the installation phase.

For Endcap chambers, deviations of B sensor platforms from specifications are measured and stored in the database. B sensor ID numbers must be read-out electronically, because they are not written on the sensor card. T sensors readout values are checked against the crossbeam temperature gradient, so to be able to detect inconsistencies and wrong installation order.

**Action on failure -** T sensor readings must be compared with the effective temperature in the hall, and there should be a reasonable agreement between the two. Temperature differences between sensors of the order of 1

\({}^{\circ}\)C are acceptable. If a sensor is not responding, first the connection cable must be checked, and then the ELMB or RasMux (AMB) channel. If no failure is found, the sensor can be malfunctioning, and must be fixed or replaced. Alignment sensors, which are calibrated as a function of their chamber position, cannot be swapped, and must be replaced by Saclay (Brandeis for Endcap).

### Gas leak

Due to the fact that not all the chambers are certified at the production sites, two types of tests are foreseen: a short term test, needed for chamber certification, and a long term test, necessary to follow along time possible leak increases. Short term test is more precise, but is also more time consuming, so for already certified chambers it should be not mandatory. Nevertheless, all chambers ready for commissioning were transported to CERN under uncontrolled conditions, and can have been damaged by very high or very low temperatures, or by strong vibrations. Therefore, it is required to know the leak condition of each chamber before starting its commissioning. If leak cannot be measured by a long term test, i.e. if chamber was not taken under pressure for at least some weeks before starting its commissioning, a short term test, even for a reduced time, must be performed.

**Type of test -** Gas leak is measured in two ways: a short term test, which duration should last until the measurement error is smaller than the measured value, and a long term test, which will last up to the installation. On Endcap chambers, it can only be performed up to the sector installation, then a new certification must be done for the complete sector. When pieces are added to the chamber gas system without dismantling anything, for example when on-chamber gas pipes are 

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:11]

(2 * volume-of-single-tube-in-liters) * 10\({}^{\text{-5}}\) * 3600 * 24 (mbar/day)

Multilayers leaking few threshold units (\(<\) 10) are still acceptable, if it is proven that leak is distributed and not coming from very few tubes, but for them the long term test is mandatory, in order to understand whether the leak is stable or increases in time. It is known that chambers leaking up to 100 threshold units can still work fine, but in order to maintain at least one order of magnitude as a safety factor over 10 years of ATLAS operation, 10 threshold units are the maximum leak allowed.

**Action on failure -** Short term check should be performed before noise and cosmic ray tests, because leaks that lead to failure must be fixed. If leak of one multilayer is greater than 10 threshold units, it must be detected and fixed, if technically possible. When not possible, the leaking tube must be insulated from chamber gas system and disconnected from HV, as reported in Appendix 1.

**Summary of requirements -** All chambers must be certified at least once, at production sites or at commissioning sites.

Barrel chambers carrying RPCs must be certified at CERN by means of a short term test. Other chambers, already certified locally, can be commissioned if they were monitored for long enough to get a measurement error of the order of 1 mbar/day, otherwise they must pass a short term test.

All chambers should be equipped with valves, in order to perform the long term test. For chambers not equipped with valves, some short checks must be foreseen periodically.

### Hedgehog card and wire continuity check

If not yet done at the production sites, the chain HV hedgehog-wire-RO hedgehog must be checked for circuit continuity. Recommended hardware is the Mecca card, designed by Michigan University. Instructions on how to perform the test can be found at

[http://atlas.physics.lsa.umich.edu/docushare/dsweb/View/Collection-395](http://atlas.physics.lsa.umich.edu/docushare/dsweb/View/Collection-395)

Some RO hedgehogs have coated foams on their socket pins, which lead to poor or flicky contacts between corresponding mezzanine card sockets. They have to be cleaned, using the following method:

* immerse the 2/3 in depth of the RO hedgehog sockets in acetone for 10 minutes, taking care of avoiding any contact between acetone and the conformed card surface;
* carefully brush the pins with an electric tooth brush.

### Current leak

This test is performed at two different voltages, after having flushed the chamber for at least 4 volume exchanges: at the nominal working voltage, 3.08 kV, with data acquired possibly all the time the chamber is supplied at that voltage (during noise and cosmic ray tests), and at 3.4 kV, the voltage at which all tubes were tested, with data acquired for short time, of the order of 10 minutes. Chamber can be longer tested at 3.4 kV, but it has to be taken in account that ageing can increase for long times, especially if chambers are equipped with not certified valves. However, the duration of the test at 3.4 kV also depends on how long current takes to be stable. Normally, this time is very short, of the order of tens of seconds if chamber stands at 3.08 kV for some hours before raising voltage to 3.4 kV.

Acceptance criterion is only applied to the 3.4 kV test, voltage at which weak or bad tubes show up.

**Method of test -** Chambers must be filled in with the correct mixture Ar/CO\({}_{2}\) 93/7 at the correct pressure, 3.0 bara, and moisture should not exceed 55- 60%. Currents must be measured and recorded independently for both multilayers, with a resolution of at least 10 nA, using standard commercial HV modules or custom equipments. The ramp-up and ramp-down parameters of the HV power supply must be set to 100 V/s or less. Chambers under commissioning should have installed and connected to the Faraday cages the HV splitter, and this prevents any measurement at layer level. However, if the HV splitter is not present, as it is the case for Endcap chambers during commissioning phase one, measurements can be done separately for each layer, and compared one to each other in order to catch for possible leaking tubes layer by layer.

**Acceptance criteria -** For one multilayer, current threshold at 3.4 kV is:

2 * length-of-single-tube-in-meters * number-of-tubes + 5 * number-of-hedgehogs (nA)

where number of hedgehogs is computed summing both RO and HV.

For single tube, threshold is:

2 * length-of-tube-in-meters (nA)

**Action on failure -** The cause of current leak must be identified (if tube, HV or RO hedgehog) and replaced. Generally, multilayer current should be compared to reference currents, taken fromgood multilayers. If it is significantly higher, in order to identify the leaking tube (or tubes) it is necessary to open the HV Faraday cage and disconnect layers and HV hedgehogs, removing jumpers, until the leaking zone, 6 or 8 tubes, is identified. Then, the corresponding HV and/or RO hedgehog must be removed, and leaking tube can be identified supplying HV to single tubes by means of a proper HV cable.

Generally, high current tubes are also noisy, and they can be much more easily detected with the noise test. If high current is due to something else than discharges, like dirty paths between HV and ground on endplugs, the only worry is related to possible leak increase in time that can lead the HV power supply to a trip. As a rule of thumb, tubes with leaks exceeding the whole multilayer limit and not noisy should be disconnected from HV.

Tubes with large leaks must be cured with reverse voltage, as explained in Appendix 1. The greatest part of leaking tubes are recovered after curing. Tubes still showing large leaks should be checked against noise in order to decide whether disconnecting them from HV or rewiring them, if this technique is available to the group. Tubes with leaks exceeding the whole multilayer limit after curing should be disconnected or rewired.

All cured and disconnected/rewired tubes must be flagged with a fail code in the database.

### Noise

Noise is related to many parameters, some of them under control, like ASD threshold and hysteresis, and others dependent on the setup, on the environment or on some tube defects, like ground loops, EMI pick-up or HV discharges in tubes. Aim of the test is to measure the chamber noise distribution as a function of the controlled parameters, minimizing the external interferences, so to be able to catch at the discharging tubes, and in most cases to cure them. Since the noise distribution of all mezzanine cards as a function of threshold was already measured in Boston, it is necessary taking data at only one threshold value.

**Method of test -** Chambers must be filled in with Ar/CO\({}_{2}\) 93/7 at 3.0 bara, and flushed for at least 4 volume exchanges before starting test. Test must be performed at HV off and on, at nominal voltage of 3.08 kV. Minimum number of collected events for each of the two different conditions depends on available time and on required precision. It could be as small as few thousand events (for 50k events the error for 100 Hz noise rate is 20%) up to some million events, if one wants to also check noise stability in time.

The simplest way of taking noise data is using a random trigger at a rate close to the maximum allowed by the acquisition setup. Test time should not be longer than one - two hours.

The way of programming threshold, hysteresis and all other read-out parameters is reported in [2]. Setting threshold for the noise test depends on hysteresis and offset voltage of mezzanines channels. An "effective threshold" is defined by the formula:

\[\mathrm{V_{eff}=V_{th}-V_{hys}+V_{ofs}}\]

where \(\mathrm{V_{ofs}}\) is the signed offset voltage of the channel. Offsets were measured for all mezzanine channels, and are available in the mezzanine production database at

[http://hepldb.harvard.edu/mezz1/ASDmain.asp](http://hepldb.harvard.edu/mezz1/ASDmain.asp)

Because of the fact that thresholds are programmable for single ASD, i.e. they are equal for groups of 8 channels, effective threshold is not the same for all channels within an ASD. Suggested effective threshold, used by US groups, is the following:

\[\mathrm{V_{eff}=V_{th}-V_{hys}+0.5*(V_{omin}+V_{omax})} \mathrm{when\leavevmode\nobreak\ }\mathrm{V_{ofs}\leq 12\leavevmode\nobreak\ mV}\] \[\mathrm{V_{eff}=V_{th}-V_{hys}+0.5*(V_{omin}+V_{omax})-2\leavevmode \nobreak\ mV} \mathrm{when\leavevmode\nobreak\ }\mathrm{12\leavevmode\nobreak\ mV<V_{ofs}\leq 14 \leavevmode\nobreak\ mV}\] \[\mathrm{V_{eff}=V_{th}-V_{hys}+0.5*(V_{omin}+V_{omax})-4\leavevmode \nobreak\ mV} \mathrm{when\leavevmode\nobreak\ }\mathrm{14\leavevmode\nobreak\ mV<V_{ofs}\leq 16 \leavevmode\nobreak\ mV}\]

where \(\mathrm{V_{omin}}\) and \(\mathrm{V_{omax}}\) are respectively the minimum and maximum \(\mathrm{V_{ofs}}\) among the 8 channels belonging to one ASD.

For this test, hysteresis should be \(\mathrm{V_{hys}=8.75\leavevmode\nobreak\ mV}\), and effective threshold should be \(\mathrm{V_{eff}=-50\leavevmode\nobreak\ mV}\). \(\mathrm{V_{th}}\) varies as a function of \(\mathrm{V_{ofs}}\).

**Acceptance criteria -** They depend on the adopted ASD parameters. With an effective threshold \(\mathrm{V_{eff}=-50\leavevmode\nobreak\ mV}\), the acceptance threshold referred to a complete chamber is:

\[\mathrm{Average\ noise\ rate\ per\ tube=5\leavevmode\nobreak\ kHz}\]

including all chamber tubes. In case of presence of very high noisy tubes, they must be cured and noise test must be repeated. A careful check of histograms of all tubes is recommended, in order to evaluate the single tube noise.

Average noise rate is not the only needed criterion. Few tubes can have a very high rate, while the average noise is not over threshold. Single tube rate can downgrade track reconstruction, so it should be limited to a value much lower than the expected physical background in ATLAS. The worst case background rate is estimated \(100\leavevmode\nobreak\ \mathrm{Hz/cm^{2}}\), so for the longest tubes in the hottest region (EIL) a rate of about 90 kHz/tube is expected. Taking an increase of rate, due to the noise, of less than 10%, the maximum allowed rate for the single tube is around 40 kHz. Rescaling this value for the suggested noise test threshold of -50 mV, the maximum allowed rate for any single tube is:

Maximum rate per tube = 5 kHz

If a tube is over this rate, it must be cured with reverse HV, assuming the noise is only due to internal discharges. In order to be sure of this, HV and RO hedgehogs and mezzanine should be replaced before curing the tube, and its ground contacts should be carefully inspected.

If a tube still shows a very high rate after curing, first it must be software disabled. After this, if crosstalk to adjacent channels is too high, compromising their performance, tube must be hardware disconnected from HV.

How to disconnect a tube from HV is explained in Appendix 1.

**Action on failure -** If a chamber is over the limit, and many tubes are noisy, all attempts must be made in order to check the ground and HV connections. Major checks are summarized here:

* HV must be supplied by means of the HV splitter. Check integrity of splitter;
* Check cable connections on the HV hedgehog;
* Check for good ground connection (less than 0.5 \(\Omega\)) of Faraday cages and of crossplates and longbeams;
* Check earth connection of the chamber support frame;
* Bottom plates must be screwed to all endplugs. Check that all screws are present and tight, and the same for all ground pins.

If a tube is over the limit, its HV and RO hedgehogs, and mezzanine, must be replaced, in order to be sure that they are not the source of noise. If the noise doesn't change, tube must be cured reversing HV. Technical details on curing a tube and disconnecting it from HV are described in Appendix 1.

### Cosmic rays

Overall chamber performance can be tested using cosmic rays. In particular, cable mismatches can only be detected with this test.

**Method of test -** Cosmic test stands are already functional in all the three commissioning sites. Each stand can host more than one chamber at a time, up to three. Test can therefore be performedin parallel. Chambers to be tested must be equipped at least with the CSM motherboard and the HV splitter, and must be connected in a proper way to earth, avoiding loops. They must be filled in with standard gas at standard pressure, and flushed at about 10 volumes/day for the first 12 hours. After this time, flow must be decreased up to 1 volume/day or less, and standard HV can be applied.

RO parameters should be close to the nominal, so effective threshold should be V\({}_{\mathrm{eff}}\) = -40 mV, with V\({}_{\mathrm{hys}}\) = 8.75 mV. V\({}_{\mathrm{eff}}\) = -40 mV corresponds to discriminating around the 23\({}^{\mathrm{rd}}\) primary electron.

Following [4], collected hits per tube should be at least 30k, corresponding to about 2M events per chamber. With a trigger rate of 100 Hz, the time needed to take 2M events is of the order of 6 hours, but some more time is needed in order to analyze data and, if necessary, to fix possible problems. If no problems are detected, two days can be considered sufficient for testing up to three chambers.

**Analysis -** It should be performed on-line, or at least immediately after the availability of data, but only for the minimal set of parameters needed to characterize the chamber. They are:

- Hit maps for each layer;

- Average drift time for all tubes (average T\({}_{\mathrm{max}}\)
- average T\({}_{0}\));

- TDC spectra for all tubes

- Charge distribution

Read-out electronics performance can be analyzed taking threshold scans. This test can detect deviations of parameters, like offset voltages, with respect to the accepted range. Anyway, all mezzanines were already tested on a bench test, so threshold scans are optional.

**Acceptance criteria -** Chamber passes the test if:

- tube occupancies show no major inefficiencies;

- all tube have drift times within 20 ns from the average drift time of the chamber. Generally, drift time differences within a chamber are of the order of \(2-3\) ns, but wrong gas flow on single tubes, typically due to obstructed or partially obstructed tubeles, gives drift time differences of more than 50 ns. The limit of 20 ns fits well with data accumulated in all three commissioning sites.

Charge distribution analysis is mandatory when no threshold scan is made, so to be able to identify possible read-out malfunctioning. Charge distribution histograms must be checked for all single tubes.

**Action on failure -** Broken wires should have been detected during the wire continuity test, anyway the cosmic ray test is normally the last done, so any broken wire must be detected with this test and flagged. When possible, broken wires should be replaced using one of the three available techniques.

In case of low occupancy of some tubes, gas system, hedgehogs and mezzanines must be checked, and possibly replaced. Low occupancy can be caused by big gas leak, or by high effective threshold. In the first case, low occupancy should affect one or few tubes only, while in the second case clusters of 8 tubes or multiples of 8 can be affected.

## 4 Database information

The global database is based on Oracle, already used by TGC. It will be modified and adapted to the MDT requirements. All relevant information collected during commissioning must be saved into the global database, but groups can adopt as local database a different approach, like Access or text files. Local databases has to be maintained directly by each group that use them.

If a local database is used, information can be stored either simultaneously on local and global databases, or on local database first and after, periodically, on global database. The first approach is recommended. If global database is updated periodically, the period should be less than one week.

Summary reports should also be saved into Oracle database, while raw data files must be in a file structure pointed to from Oracle database.

In the following, it is assumed that all general information (chamber ID, operator name, date, etc.) is already loaded in the database, so only information related to chamber status and to the specific tests is discussed.

### Chamber specific information

All known information concerning chamber status before starting commissioning should be recorded:

- Broken wires, or disconnected tubes, if any (tube ID);

- leaking tubes, if any (tube ID);

- leaking tubes or endplugs fixed with glue, if any (tube ID)

- high current tubes, if any (tube ID);

- noisy tubes, if any (tube ID) ;

- low efficiency tubes, if any (tube ID).

- HV splitter barcode (4 digits)

- CSM motherboard barcode (16 digits);

- ELMB barcode (14 digits) and ELMB serial number (written on the cover);

- Rasmux barcode (14 digits);

- B sensor ID and location. For Endcap chambers location is implicit in cabling. There is no barcode on sensors, ID is read-out electronically;

- T sensor ID numbers (for Endcap only)

- Mezzanine card ID barcode, if not already done in the production database;* RO and HV hedgehog serial numbers, is not already done in the production database.

### Alignment

* All data recorded by test programs provided by Saclay and Brandeis;
* One in-plane measurement.

### Sag compensation

* readings of the in-plane system before compensation;
* readings of the in-plane system after compensation.

### T, B and alignment sensors

* One measurement of T, B and alignment sensors. For Barrel chambers, alignment sensors should be subdivided in axial/praxial, projectives, Reference, CCC (Chamber to Chamber Connection) and BBC (BIM-BIR Connection).

### Gas leak

For short term test:

* Gas type and pressure in bar;
* Chamber or gas temperature;
* Leak rate of the two multilayers separately, in mbar/day;

For long term test:

* Chamber temperature;
* Date of first measurement;
* First measured pressure, in mbar;
* Dates of successive measurements;
* Measured pressures, in mbar;
* Estimated leak rate of the two multilayers separately, in mbar/day.

Long term test needs many measurements. If saving many unknown measurements is not possible, the estimated leak is overwritten at every new measurement.

### Current leak

* Voltage used in the test, in Volt;* Measured current, for each multilayer (or for each layer), in nA;
* Fail code for high current tubes;
* Fail code for cured tubes;
* Fail code for rewired tubes.

### _Noise_

* Rate for every tube, in Hz;
* Fail code for tubes over 5 kHz limit;
* Fail code for disconnected tubes;
* Fail code for rewired tubes.

### _Cosmic rays_

* Chamber working conditions (gas pressure (in bar), mixing percentage, gas flow rate (in nl/hour));
* Environmental conditions (temperature and RH);
* Pointer to the function and fit range definitions for determining T\({}_{0}\) and drift times, in order to get the same parameters for all groups;
* T\({}_{0}\) for every tube, in ns;
* Drift time for every tube, in ns;
* Fail code for tubes with drift time out of requirement;
* Fail code for tubes with low occupancy.

## 5 Summary report

Use of summary reports for each chamber under commissioning is strongly recommended. They have to be both recorded as files and printed out as paper attached to chambers.

Two summary reports, the first used by US groups and the second by the BIL groups, can be found in Appendix 4, as examples of very complete (the first) and very compact (the second) reports.
