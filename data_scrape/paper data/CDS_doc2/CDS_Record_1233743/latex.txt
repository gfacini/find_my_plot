**Cut-based Identification of Hadronic \(\tau\) Decays in Early ATLAS Data**

The ATLAS collaboration

Two cut-based methods for the identification of hadronically decaying \(\tau\) leptons are presented. For analyses with data corresponding to 10-200 pb\({}^{-1}\) of integrated luminosity, these cut-based methods use only variables that can be well understood during the early data-taking period. The calorimeter identification method uses only variables calculated from energy deposits in the calorimeters, and the calorimeter\(+\)track identification method uses variables based on tracking information in addition to the calorimeter variables. The performance of these methods in terms of efficiency and rejection against jets is also shown for simulation.

Introduction

The \(\tau\) lepton, with a mass of \(m_{\tau}=1776.84\pm 0.17\) MeV [1], is the only lepton heavy enough to decay both leptonically and hadronically. It decays approximately 65% of the time to one or more hadrons and 35% of the time leptonically. The reconstruction and identification of \(\tau\) leptons are important in many searches of the Standard Model (SM) and for new phenomena. They can appear in final states in the production of Higgs bosons, supersymmetric (SUSY) particles, and other particles not described by the SM [2]. Standard Model processes, such as the \(W\), \(Z\) boson and \(t\bar{t}\) production can also result in signatures with \(\tau\) leptons, and events from these processes can be used to study \(\tau\) lepton reconstruction in detail and establish \(\tau\) lepton identification.

A challenge in identifying hadronically decaying \(\tau\) leptons is to distinguish them from hadronic jets which are produced in processes with very large cross-sections. Such \(\tau\) lepton decays possess, however, properties that can be used to differentiate them from jets. For hadronically decaying \(\tau\) leptons the fraction of decays to one (1-prong) or three (3-prong) charged particles are approximately 77% and 23%, respectively. Their decay products tend to be well collimated and the invariant mass of the visible decay products is usually smaller than those of jets. The \(\tau\) lepton proper decay length is 87 \(\mu\)m, leading to decay vertices that can be resolved in the silicon tracker from the primary interaction vertex.

This note describes methods that have been developed to identify hadronic decays of \(\tau\) leptons in the early data-taking period for ATLAS [3], to be used with \(\sim 10-200\) pb\({}^{-1}\) of integrated luminosity, particularly for SM signatures such as \(W\rightarrow\tau\nu\) and \(Z\rightarrow\tau\tau\) that have final states with hadronic \(\tau\) decays. These methods use rectangular cuts on identification variables of these \(\tau\) candidates. Complex multivariate methods are purposely avoided, as cut-based selections will be easier to understand and tune during the early data-taking period. The variables that are used are "robust" variables: variables that will be quickly calibrated and understood in early data. Many of these variables that are used are ratios of energies, so that systematic effects due to energy scale cancel. While tracking variables are used in some cases, the use of high precision tracking is avoided, such as variables dependent on impact parameter or secondary vertex reconstruction. Variables that use complex methods such as energy-flow determination of the \(\tau\) candidate energy or \(\pi^{0}\) reconstruction are also not used.

In this note, Section 2 describes the reconstruction of hadronically decaying \(\tau\) leptons, Section 3 outlines the variables used for this cut-based approach and the optimization procedure, Section 4 describes the performance of the cut-based selections, and Section 5 provides a summary and outlook.

## 2 Reconstruction of hadronically decaying \(\tau\) leptons

Hadronically decaying \(\tau\) leptons are reconstructed at ATLAS in various steps. The first step is seed building of which there are two seed types. The first seed type is a track with \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>6\) GeV that satisfies quality criteria on the number of associated hits in the silicon tracker and on the impact parameter with respect to the interaction vertex. Candidates that are built from these seeds are called track seeded candidates. The second type of seed consists of calorimeter jets reconstructed from topological clusters (topoclusters) [4] with \(E_{\mathrm{T}}>10\) GeV. These clusters are grouped into a jet using a cone algorithm [5] with a cone radius of \(\Delta R=\sqrt{(\Delta\eta)^{2}+(\Delta\phi)^{2}}=0.4\). Candidates that are built from these seeds are called calorimeter seeded candidates.

These jets are then matched to the seed tracks in a cone of radius \(\Delta R=0.2\). If such a match is found, the \(\tau\) candidate is considered as having two valid seeds. For reconstructed and truth-matched \(\tau\) candidates in \(Z\rightarrow\tau\tau\) MC events with true \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{vis}}>10\) GeV and \(|\eta|<2.5\), 70% of \(\tau\) candidates have two valid seeds, 25% have only a calorimeter seed, and 5% have only a track seed, where \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{vis}}\) is the transverse energy of the visible \(\tau\) decay products (that excludes the \(E_{\mathrm{T}}\) of the \(\nu_{\mathrm{\tau}}\)).

The energy of the \(\tau\) candidate is calculated in two ways: the global cell weighting calculation and the energy flow calculation. For \(\tau\) candidates with a calorimeter seed, the global cell weighting calculation is used [6], where calorimeter cells associated to the \(\tau\) candidate in a cone of \(\Delta R=0.4\) are summed and weighted according to a function dependent on their \(\eta\) coordinate and the cell signal density \(\rho_{\rm i}=E_{\rm i}/V_{\rm i}\), with \(E_{\rm i}\) being the raw energy of the cell and \(V_{\rm i}\) its volume. Since this calculation overestimates the visible energy of the \(\tau\) candidate, a \(\tau\) specific calibration [7] has to be applied to correct for this effect. For \(\tau\) candidates with a track seed, an energy flow calculation [7] is used to determine the energy, where energy deposits in cells matched to charged tracks in a narrow cone of \(\Delta R=0.0375\) are subtracted and replaced by the momentum of such tracks. This energy flow determination is also corrected for energy leakage coming from charged particles outside the narrow cone. For candidates with two valid seeds, the global cell weighting calculation is considered the default energy.

Tracks that are associated to each \(\tau\) candidate in a cone of \(\Delta R=0.2\) around the seed axis are also required to pass similar quality criteria as seed tracks. The \(\tau\) candidate is said to be reconstructed with \(n\)-prongs if there are \(n\) tracks associated to it.

Topoclusters found in the electromagnetic (EM) calorimeter with \(E_{\rm T}>1\) GeV that are isolated from tracks are interpreted as energy deposits from \(\pi^{0}\) mesons in the \(\tau\) lepton decay. This procedure finds that approximately 66% of \(\tau\to\pi\nu\) decays are reconstructed with zero \(\pi^{0}\) subclusters, while more than 50% of both \(\tau^{\pm}\to\rho^{\pm}\nu\to\pi^{\pm}\pi^{0}\nu\) and \(\tau^{\pm}\to a_{1}^{\pm}\nu\to\rho^{\pm}\pi^{0}\nu\to\pi^{\pm}\pi^{0}\pi^{0}\nu\) decays are reconstructed with one and two \(\pi^{0}\) subclusters, respectively.

Based on the calorimeter information, the associated tracks and reconstructed \(\pi^{0}\) clusters, a variety of other variables are calculated to be used for the identification of \(\tau\) leptons. Not all such variables are considered as robust variables. Descriptions of these variables can be found in Ref. [7]. The robust variables that are used for the cut-based identification of \(\tau\) leptons are listed in Sections 3.1 and 3.2.

Muons are vetoed by requiring that the calorimetric energy deposited by the \(\tau\) candidate has \(E_{\rm T}>5\) GeV. To veto electrons, cuts are placed upon \(\tau\) candidates on the following two quantities: the ratio of the energy deposited in the EM calorimeter to the track momentum which tends to be higher for electrons than for charged hadrons, and the ratio of high threshold hits to low threshold hits in the Transition Radiation Tracker for the track, which also tends to be higher for electrons [8].

## 3 Cut-based methods for \(\tau\) identification

After the reconstruction of \(\tau\) candidates, an identification step must be performed to distinguish candidates originating from hadronically decaying \(\tau\) leptons and those originating from jets. Identification variables that will be well understood in the early data taking phase (robust variables) are used in this cut-based selection. Therefore some variables were avoided, including those based on: precision tracking (i.e. variables dependent on secondary vertex reconstruction or impact parameter significances), \(\pi^{0}\) reconstruction, energy flow calculations, number of cells in the \(\eta\)-strip layer (first layer of the electromagnetic barrel) that exceed 200 MeV, \(\tau\) specific energy calibrations, and the number of tracks that are found in an isolation region (outside \(\Delta R>0.2\)). One cut-based method (calorimeter identification method) uses variables that are derived from calorimetric deposits only, and can be used in case the tracking detectors are not well understood. The other method (calorimeter+track identification method) extends the number of variables used to include information from tracks associated to the \(\tau\) candidate (within \(\Delta R<0.2\)).

Currently three types of optimization for both methods are defined: tight, medium and loose, corresponding to efficiencies of approximately \(0.3,0.5,\) and \(0.7\). The efficiencies are calculated with respect to the number of true hadronically decaying \(\tau\) leptons with \(E_{\rm T}^{\rm vis}>10\) GeV and \(|\eta|<2.5\).

These cuts are separately optimized for \(\tau\) candidates with one or zero track and those with two or more tracks. In addition, the optimization is performed in reconstructed \(E_{\rm T}^{\rm vis}\) bins. The following five \(E_{\rm T}^{\rm vis}\) bins are defined: 10-25 GeV, 25-45 GeV, 45-70 GeV, 70-100 GeV and \(>\)100 GeV. The optimization using the calorimeter identification method is performed on all \(\tau\) candidates with a calo-seed, while the calorimeter+track identification method is optimized on \(\tau\) candidates with both track and calo-seeds.

The optimization is performed using Pythia samples [9] of \(Z\rightarrow\tau\tau\) and \(bbA\to bb\tau\tau\) (\(m_{A}=800\) GeV, to give high \(E_{\mathrm{T}}\)\(\tau\) leptons) events for signal and Pythia dijets with a momentum transfer at hard scatter ranging from 17-560 GeV for background.

### Variables for the calorimeter identification method

This method applies selection criteria on calorimeter seeded \(\tau\) candidates. It uses a selection of four calorimetric variables. The following variables are used:

* **Electromagnetic radius** The electromagnetic radius \(R_{\mathrm{EM}}\) is defined as: \[R_{\mathrm{EM}}=\frac{\sum\limits_{i=1}^{\Delta R<0.4}E_{\mathrm{T},i}^{ \mathrm{EM}}\sqrt{\left(\eta_{i}^{\mathrm{EM}}-\eta_{\mathrm{calosed}} \right)^{2}+\left(\phi_{i}^{\mathrm{EM}}-\phi_{\mathrm{calosed}}\right)^{2}}}{ \sum\limits_{i=1}^{\Delta R<0.4}E_{\mathrm{T},i}^{\mathrm{EM}}}\] where \(i\) runs over all cells in the associated topoclusters of the \(\tau\) candidate. The quantities \(\eta_{i}^{\mathrm{EM}}\), \(\phi_{i}^{\mathrm{EM}}\) and \(E_{\mathrm{T},i}^{\mathrm{EM}}\) denote the position and transverse energy of cell \(i\), while \(\eta_{\mathrm{calosed}}\) and \(\phi_{\mathrm{calosed}}\) are the coordinates for the calorimeter seeded \(\tau\) candidate.
* **Transverse energy width in the \(\eta\) strip layer** The transverse energy width \(W_{\mathrm{strip}}\) in the \(\eta\) strip layer is defined as: \[W_{\mathrm{strip}}=\sqrt{\frac{\sum\limits_{i}^{\Delta R<0.4}E_{\mathrm{T},i}^ {\mathrm{strip}}\left(\eta_{i}-\eta_{\mathrm{calosed}}\right)^{2}}{\sum \limits_{i}^{\Delta R<0.4}E_{\mathrm{T},i}^{\mathrm{strip}}}}\] where the sum runs over strip cells in the associated topoclusters of the \(\tau\) candidate and \(E_{\mathrm{T},i}^{\mathrm{strip}}\) is the corresponding strip transverse energy.
* **Isolation in the calorimeter** The isolation fraction \(f_{\mathrm{iso}}\) is defined as: \[f_{\mathrm{iso}}=\frac{\sum\limits_{i}^{0.1<\Delta R<0.2}E_{\mathrm{T},i}^{ \mathrm{EM}}}{\sum\limits_{j}^{\Delta R<0.4}E_{\mathrm{T},j}^{\mathrm{EM}}}\] where the indices \(i\) and \(j\) run over the electromagnetic cell transverse energies \(E_{\mathrm{T},i}^{\mathrm{EM}}\) and \(E_{\mathrm{T},j}^{\mathrm{EM}}\) in the associated topoclusters of the \(\tau\) candidate.

* **Ratio of EM energy and total energy** The ratio \(\frac{E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{EM}}}{E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{total}}}\) is defined as: \[\frac{E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{EM}}}{E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{total}}}=\frac{ \sum_{i}^{\Delta R<0.4}E_{\mathrm{T},i}^{\mathrm{EM}}}{\sum_{i}^{ \Delta R<0.4}E_{\mathrm{T},i}^{\mathrm{EM}}+\sum_{j}^{\Delta R<0.4}E_{\mathrm{ T},j}^{\mathrm{Had}}}\] where the sums run over all cells in the associated topoclusters of the \(\tau\) candidate, \(E_{\mathrm{T},i}^{\mathrm{EM}}\) is the cell energy in the electromagnetic calorimeter and \(E_{\mathrm{T},j}^{\mathrm{Had}}\) the energy in the hadronic calorimeter, both taken after the global cell weighting calibration.

### Variables for the calorimeter\(+\)track identification method

The calorimeter\(+\)track identification method applies selection criteria on \(\tau\) candidates seeded by using both calorimeter and tracking variables. It combines the four variables of the calorimeter-based identification method described in Section 3.1 with five variables that involve tracking. This method gives a better performance due a larger number of variables providing additional information. For these variables the energies of cells associated to the \(\tau\) candidate within \(\Delta R<0.4\) of the track seed direction are considered.

* \(E_{\mathrm{T}}\) **over \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) of the leading track** This ratio \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{total}}/p_{\mathrm{T}1}\) is defined as: \[\frac{E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{total}}}{p_{\mathrm{T}1}}=\frac{\sum_{i}E_{ \mathrm{T},i}^{\mathrm{EM}}+\sum_{i}E_{\mathrm{T},i}^{\mathrm{Had}}}{p_{ \mathrm{T}1}}\] where \(E_{\mathrm{T},i}^{\mathrm{EM}}\) and \(E_{\mathrm{T},j}^{\mathrm{Had}}\) are the globally weighted transverse energies of the cells associated to the \(\tau\) candidate in the EM and hadronic calorimeters, respectively, and \(p_{\mathrm{T}1}\) is the transverse momentum of the leading track.
* **Ratio of EM energy and sum of \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) of tracks** This variable \(\frac{E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{EM}}}{p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{total}}}\) is defined as: \[\frac{E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{EM}}}{p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{total}}}=\frac{ \sum_{i}E_{\mathrm{T},i}^{\mathrm{EM}}}{\sum_{j=1}^{N}p_{\mathrm{T},j}^{ \mathrm{track}}}\] where \(E_{\mathrm{T},i}^{\mathrm{EM}}\) is the energy after global cell weighting calibration in cell \(i\) and the sum in the denominator runs over the transverse momenta \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{track}}\) of the \(N=\min(n,3)\) highest \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) tracks associated to the \(n\)-prong \(\tau\) candidate.
* **Ratio of hadronic energy and sum of \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) of tracks** This ratio \(\frac{E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{Had}}}{p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{track}}}\) is defined as: \[\frac{E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{Had}}}{p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{total}}}=\frac{ \sum_{i}E_{\mathrm{T},i}^{\mathrm{Had}}}{\sum_{j=1}^{N}p_{\mathrm{T},j}^{ \mathrm{track}}}\] where \(E_{\mathrm{T},i}^{\mathrm{Had}}\) is the energy in cell \(i\) after global cell weighting calibration and the sums in the denominator run over the transverse momenta \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{track}}\) of the \(N=\min(n,3)\) highest \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) tracks associated to the \(\tau\) candidate.

* **Ratio of sum of \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) of tracks and total energy** This ratio \(\frac{p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{total}}}{E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{total}}}\) is defined as: \[\frac{p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{total}}}{E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{total}}}=\frac{ \sum_{k=1}^{N}p_{\mathrm{T},k}^{\mathrm{track}}}{\sum_{i}E_{\mathrm{T},i}^{ \mathrm{EM}}+\sum_{j}E_{\mathrm{T},j}^{\mathrm{Had}}}\] where the sum in the numerator runs over the transverse momentum \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{track}}\) of the \(N=\min(n,3)\) leading tracks associated to the \(n\)-prong \(\tau\) candidate, \(E_{\mathrm{T},i}^{\mathrm{EM}}\) is the cell energy in the electromagnetic calorimeter and \(E_{\mathrm{T},j}^{\mathrm{Had}}\) the cell energy in the hadronic calorimeter, with cell energies being taken after global cell weighting calibration. This variable is the reciprocal of \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{total}}/p_{\mathrm{T}1}\) for 1-prong \(\tau\) candidates.
* **Track spread** The spread of tracks in \(\eta,\phi\)-space, weighted with their transverse momentum, \(W_{\mathrm{track}}^{\tau}\), for multi-track candidates is defined as: \[W_{\mathrm{track}}^{\tau}=\frac{\sum\left(\Delta R^{\mathrm{track}}\right)^{2 }\cdot p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{track}}}{\sum p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{track}}} -\frac{\left(\sum\Delta R^{\mathrm{track}}\cdot p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{track }}\right)^{2}}{\left(\sum p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{track}}\right)^{2}}\] where \(\Delta R^{\mathrm{track}}\) is the distance between the track and the \(\tau\) candidate track seed in \(\eta-\phi\) space, and the summation is performed over all tracks associated to the \(\tau\) candidate.

The distributions for the variables described above are shown in Figure 1 for 1-prong \(\tau\) candidates in \(Z\to\tau\tau\) and \(bbA\to bb\tau\tau\) signal samples and QCD dijet background samples with \(25<E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{vis}}<45\) GeV. Figure 2 shows the distributions for 3-prong candidates using the same signal and background samples in the same \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{vis}}\) range. Note that the discrimination power of these variables varies with the \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{vis}}\) of the \(\tau\) candidate.

### Optimization procedure

The optimization for the cut-based selections was performed in multiple steps for five \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{vis}}\) bins (10-25 GeV, 25-45 GeV, 45-70 GeV, 70-100 GeV and \(>\)100 GeV). One optimization was performed using \(\tau\) candidates matched to 1-prong \(\tau\) leptons for the signal and \(\tau\) candidates with zero or one associated tracks for the background. Another optimization was performed using \(\tau\) candidates matched to 3-prong \(\tau\) leptons for the signal and \(\tau\) candidates with two or more associated tracks for the background.

TMVA, a Toolkit for Multivariate Data Analysis [10] was used for the optimization. All variables described in Sections 3.1 and 3.2 were used as input for a rectangular cut optimization. This classifier returns a binary response (signal or background) and maximizes the background rejection at a given signal efficiency.

## 4 Performance of the cut-based selections

To assess the performance of the cut-based identification, both methods will be compared with a projective logarithmic likelihood method for both the calorimeter and calorimeter+track identification methods where the likelihood method is tuned on a broader selection of discriminant variables that is not restricted to the robust variables. This likelihood method is intended to be used when the \(\tau\) identification variables are more fully understood, and thus uses as many variables as possible to maximize discrimination power. The performance of both methods was tested using statistically independent events from the same samples as used in the optimization phase.

The performance is presented in the background rejection versus signal efficiency plane. For the signal efficiency, \(\epsilon_{\tau}^{\text{n-prong}}\), \(\tau\) candidates were matched to Monte Carlo \(\tau\) leptons with \(E_{\text{T}}^{\text{vis}}>\)10 GeV and \(|\eta|<2.5\) within a cone of \(\Delta R\)=0.2. The efficiency was calculated for all five \(E_{\text{T}}^{\text{vis}}\) bins and decay modes:

\[\epsilon_{\tau}^{\text{n-prong}}=\frac{\text{number of matched reconstructed n-prong }\tau\text{ candidates passing cuts}}{\text{number of true hadronically decaying n-prong }\tau\text{ leptons}}\]

for \(n=1\) or 3.

The background rejection \(r\), which gives the ratio of rejected candidates to accepted candidates is defined as:

\[r=\frac{1}{\epsilon_{\text{bkg}}}-1,\]

where the background efficiency, \(\epsilon_{\text{bkg}}\), is defined as:

\[\epsilon_{\text{bkg}}=\frac{\text{number of reconstructed }\tau\text{ candidates passing cuts}}{\text{number of all reconstructed }\tau\text{ candidates}}.\]

### Performance of calorimeter identification method

Figure 3 shows the performance of the calorimeter identification method as described in Section 3.1 for 1-prong candidates, the performance for 3-prong candidates is shown in Figure 4. For both 1-prong and 3-prong \(\tau\) candidates, a calorimeter seed was required. Table 1 shows the efficiencies and rejection rates for the loose, medium, and tight cuts for 1-prong and 3-prong candidates using the calorimeter identification method.

The performance for 1-prong candidates is better than that for 3-prong candidates. The efficiencies for loose, medium and tight cut thresholds deviate from the target efficiencies of 70%, 50% and 30%

Figure 1: Distributions of calorimeter and tracking variables for 1-prong \(\tau\) candidates within a \(E_{\text{T}}^{\text{vis}}\) range of 25–45 GeV. The signal distributions come from 1-prong \(\tau\) candidates in \(Z\rightarrow\tau\tau\) and \(A\ \rightarrow\ \tau\ \tau\) events matched to true hadronically decaying \(\tau\) leptons, while the background distributions come from 1-prong \(\tau\) candidates in QCD dijet samples.

respectively since they are computed requiring that the signal \(\tau\) candidates are reconstructed with the correct number of tracks, whereas the optimization does not have such a requirement.

### Performance of calorimeter+track identification method

The performance for the calorimeter+track identification method as described in Section 3.2 is shown in Figure 5 for 1-prong candidates, and in Figure 6 for 3-prong candidates. For both cases the \(\tau\) candidates are reconstructed from both calorimeter and track seeds. Table 2 shows the efficiencies and rejection rates for the loose, medium, and tight cuts for 1-prong and 3-prong candidates using the calorimeter+track identification method.

As expected, the calorimeter+track identification method has a rejection considerably higher for a given efficiency than the calorimeter identification method. In both methods, the performance for 1-prong candidates is also much higher than for 3-prong candidates. The calorimeter+track identification method, although rejecting jets at a lower rate than for likelihood-based identification, still has discrimination power against jets.

Figure 2: Distributions of calorimeter and tracking variables for 3-prong \(\tau\) candidates within a \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{vis}}\) range of 25–45 GeV. The signal distributions come from 3-prong \(\tau\) candidates in \(Z\rightarrow\tau\tau\) and \(A\rightarrow\tau\tau\) events matched to true hadronically decaying \(\tau\) leptons, while the background distributions come from 3-prong \(\tau\) candidates in QCD dijet samples.

The efficiency is for true 1-prong \(\tau\) candidates, and the rejection is for jets in QCD dijet samples. For the calorimeter identification tight, medium and loose are shown in squares while the triangles extend the cut-based ID method by two additional efficiencies.

The efficiency is for true 3-prong \(\tau\) candidates, and the rejection is for jets in QCD dijet samples.

## 5 Summary and outlook

In this note the status and performance of the cut-based identification of hadronically decaying \(\tau\)-leptons with robust variables has been presented. Two methods, one using calorimeter variables, another combining calorimeter and tracking variables have been developed. Both methods use information derived from

These methods purposely avoid the use of complex multi-variate techniques and variables that may not be understood during the early data-taking period.

The performance of the cut-based identification has been tuned in different \(E_{\rm T}^{\rm vis}\) bins for loose, medium, and tight criteria. The \(\tau\) lepton identification efficiency and the rejection against jets from QCD production has been shown.

As collision data becomes readily available, the robustness of these variables will be reevaluated, using comparisions between data and MC for \(\tau\) candidates in lepton triggered data streams as well as jet triggered data streams. The stability of the distributions of the variables considered can be evaluated over different runs, and the set of variables used for \(\tau\) lepton identification can be reevaluated based on this information. This method can be further improved by replacing MC distributions of the variables with distributions of variables from collision data in appropriate control regions.

Eventually, as the ATLAS detector becomes well-understood with collision data, the list of variables that can be used for \(\tau\) lepton identification can be expanded to include variables that were previously avoided. Complex multi-variate techniques can also be relied upon more heavily, as their behaviour becomes validated with collision data.
