**Expected Performance of Boosted Higgs (\(\to b\,\bar{b}\)) Boson Identification with the ATLAS Detector at \(\sqrt{s}\) = 13 TeV**

The ATLAS Collaboration

**Abstract**

This document summarizes the boosted Higgs boson identification strategy for early Run 2 data collected by the ATLAS detector at a centre-of-mass energy of \(\sqrt{s}=13\) TeV. The studies are based on work carried out in both real and simulated data from Run 1, and are thoroughly re-evaluated and extended in simulated data at \(\sqrt{s}=13\) TeV with the updated ATLAS geometry including the newly added Insertable B-Layer pixel detector. The baseline jet reconstruction algorithm for boosted topologies in Run 2 is the anti-\(k_{t}\)\(R=1.0\) trimmed with a subjet radius of \(R_{\rm subjet}=0.2\) and a minimum transverse momentum fraction of \(f_{\rm cut}\) = 5%. After applying a baseline selection of anti-\(k_{t}\)\(R=1.0\) trimmed jets, a combination of three requirements on \(b\)-tagging based on \(R=0.2\) track jets matched to the large-\(R\) calorimeter jet, the trimmed jet mass, and the trimmed jet energy correlation ratio \(D_{2}^{(\beta=1)}\), is used to tag Higgs bosons. The Higgs boson tagging efficiency and corresponding multi-jet and hadronic top jet background rejections are shown, and several benchmark tagging selections are defined based on specific signal efficiency targets. Systematic uncertainties on the Higgs boson tagging efficiency, and on the \(b\)-tagging efficiency, mass, and \(D_{2}^{(\beta=1)}\) variables themselves are provided. The results in this note are valid for jets with transverse momentum between 250 and 1500 GeV in the central region of the detector, \(|\eta|<2.0\). The choice of selections, systematic uncertainties, and background samples constitute a baseline scenario to which more analysis and topology specific studies can be compared.

## 1 Introduction

The increase of the LHC center of mass energy to 13 \(\,\mathrm{TeV}\), and the increase in luminosity, greatly extends the sensitivity of the ATLAS experiment [1] to heavy new particles. In a significant number of new physics scenarios [2; 3; 4], these heavy new particles may have decay chains including the recently discovered Higgs boson [5; 6]. The heavy mass of the new resonances implies that a large momentum will be imparted to the Higgs boson, causing the decay products of the Higgs boson to be collimated. The decay of the Higgs boson to \(b\bar{b}\) pairs has the largest branching fraction within the Standard Model, and thus is a vital decay mode to use when searching for new and possibly rare heavy particles (see e.g. Ref. [7]), as well as for Standard Model Higgs boson precision measurements. For high momentum, or boosted, Higgs bosons decaying to \(b\bar{b}\) pairs, the signature will be a high momentum "Higgs-jet" containing two \(b\)-hadrons.

In order to identify, or tag, boosted Higgs-jets it is paramount to understand the details of \(b\)-hadron identification and the internal structure of jets, or jet substructure, in such an environment [8]. The approach to Higgs-jet tagging presented in this note is built upon a strong foundation of studies from LHC Run 1, including extensive studies of jet reconstruction and grooming algorithms [9], detailed investigations of track-jet-based \(b\)-tagging in boosted topologies [10], and the combination of substructure and \(b\)-tagging applied in the Higgs bosons pair resonance search in the 4-\(b\) final state [11]. In this note groomed large-\(R\) (\(R=1.0\)) jets are used to capture the \(b\bar{b}\) decays of the Higgs-jets and provide the energy, mass, and momentum estimates of the Higgs boson candidate. The groomed large-\(R\) jets are also used for computing discriminants based on jet substructure. Finally, the identification of \(b\)-hadrons within the large-\(R\) jet is provided by small radius (\(R=0.2\)) track jets matched to the large-\(R\) jet using the ghost-association technique [12; 13; 14].

The large-\(R\) jet kinematics, large-\(R\) jet substructure, and the track jet \(b\)-tagging information are examined and optimized for Higgs-jet identification whilst discriminating against hadronic final states from multi-jet production and boosted hadronic top-quark decays. While it is difficult to cover all possible backgrounds, these two backgrounds are studied as they are amongst the most common for analyses using boosted Higgs-jets, and provide a broad range of heavy flavor content and jet substructure for the background large-\(R\) jets. The systematic uncertainties on the Higgs-jet tagging efficiency and background rejection coming from uncertainties on the the large-\(R\) jet kinematics, large-\(R\) jet substructure, and the track jet \(b\)-tagging are fully calculated.

It should be noted that the baseline selections used here to study the signal and background performance do not cover all possible topologies. In addition, while the systematic uncertainties are derived generally, the relative impact of the different sources of uncertainty will be different if a different kinematical selection is made.

This note is organized as follows: Section 2 describes the simulated samples used for this analysis. The selection of physics objects is described in Section 3, while descriptions of jet substructure and \(b\)-tagging can be found in Sections 4 and 5, respectively. The explorations and optimization of the Higgs-jet tagging efficiency and background rejection can be found in Section 6, and the systematic uncertainties for Higgs-jet tagging are found in Section 7.

## 2 Monte Carlo samples and ATLAS detector simulation

A benchmark model consisting of a Randall-Sundrum graviton (\(RSG\)) decaying to a pair of Higgs bosons, where the boosted Higgs bosons further decay into collimated pairs of \(b\)-jets, \(RSG\to HH\to b\bar{b}\ b\bar{b}\)[2] is used for the boosted Higgs boson signal. This process is modeled using the Randall-Sundrum framework with a warped extra dimension [2], which contains spin-2 Kaluza-Klein gravitons that decay to Higgs boson pairs with coupling \(c\equiv k/\bar{M}_{P}\). Here, \(k\) is the curvature parameter and \(\bar{M}_{P}\) is the Planck mass scale.

The \(RSG\) samples have been generated for 5 mass points of \(m_{RSG}\in\{500,\,1000,\,1500,\,2000,\,2500\}\) GeV, with \(c=1\) and with the Higgs mass fixed at 125 GeV, using the implementation in Ref. [15, 16]. The samples are produced at \(\sqrt{s}=13\) TeV using MadGraph 5[17] interfaced with Pythia8[18] and with the AU2 tune [19], and CTEQ6 leading order (LO) [20] parton distribution functions (PDFs). The samples of various masses are added together without weighting by cross section in order to populate the full Higgs boson \(p_{T}\) spectrum.

The backgrounds considered are QCD multi-jet production and hadronic top production. The QCD multi-jet sample is generated at \(\sqrt{s}=13\) TeV with Pythia8, utilizing the ATLAS AUET2B LO** Pythia tune [21] and the MSTW2008 [22] LO PDF set. The hadronic \(t\bar{t}\) background samples, in which the \(W\) bosons from both top quarks decay hadronically, are generated at \(\sqrt{s}=13\) TeV using Powheg 1.0[23, 24] interfaced to Pythia v6.426, with the top mass fixed to 172.5 GeV and the CT10[25] NLO PDF set. In order to preferentially generate events with top quarks at high \(p_{T}\), the samples are generated in five bins of the mass of the \(t\bar{t}\) pair starting from \(m_{t\bar{t}}=1100\) GeV and extending above 2000 GeV.

In order to give pileup conditions similar to the data, on average 23.2 extra minimum bias interactions generated with Pythia8 are superimposed on the simulated events based on an expectation of the the actual 2015 pileup distribution. To simulate the detector response, the generated events are processed through a GEANT4 [26] simulation of the ATLAS detector, and then reconstructed and analyzed [27] in the same way as the data are. The nominal samples simulate collisions with 25 ns bunch-spacing. Hadronic showers are simulated with the FTFP_BERT physics list (FriTioF string model [28] with Precompound used for hadrons with energies above 4 GeV while the BERTini cascade[29] is used for hadrons with energies smaller than 5 GeV).

The changes between Run 1 and Run 2 relevant to this study are summarised in this paragraph and more details can be found in Refs. [30, 31]. There is an increase in the centre of mass energy of the collisions from \(\sqrt{s}=8\) TeV to 13 TeV and the bunch spacing conditions will be halved from 50 ns to 25 ns for a large fraction of 2015 data. A new detector, the Insertable B-Layer (IBL) has been installed closer to the beam pipe, improving the vertex resolution and also increasing the amount of detector material in the central region of the ATLAS detector. The reconstruction algorithm of topological clusters of calorimeter cell energy depositions [32] in 2015 has changed with respect to that of 2012 in order to better match noise measurements made in 2012 data and to mitigate the impact of pileup on jet reconstruction. Calorimeter noise thresholds used in the simulation are optimized for 2015 pileup levels. The timing and energy of the liquid argon (LAr) calorimeter are reconstructed using a linear combination of 4 sampling points instead of 5 points.

Several additional multi-jet samples (produced with the same MC generator setup and GEANT4 detector simulation) are used to estimate the uncertainty on the jet \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\), mass, and substructure scale in order to account for the known detector and readout changes between Run 1 and Run 2 briefly described above:* _Variation of noise thresholds_: the noise thresholds used in the topological cluster reconstruction are shifted up and down by a fraction consistent with the discrepancy observed between data and MC simulations in 2012 data (between 10 and 30%).
* _Run 1 topological clustering:_ the topological clustering procedure used in Run 1 is adopted.
* _Run 1_ LAr: reproduces the LAr conditions of 2012 data-taking, using 5 LAr sampling points for the energy reconstruction.
* _Early 2015 data taking:_ uses the read-out settings that will be used in the early part of the 2015 run, with 50 ns bunch spacing instead of 25 ns.

In the high \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) (\(>1\) TeV) region there is a lack of jets in Run 1 data and therefore an incomplete understanding of the jet \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) and mass scale and resolution. The impact of the modelling of the parton shower, hadronization, and the underlying event is studied using multi-jet samples generated with Herwig++[33; 34] utilizing the UE-EE-4 tune and the CTEQ6L1[20] PDF set. Seven extra variations are considered to investigate the impact of several GEANT4 simulation variations on the high \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) jet reconstruction; details can be found in Ref. [31]. These variations are all based on the FTFP and BERT models, except for QGSP_BIC. Only three of them were found to have non-negligible impact:

* _QGSP_BIC:_ hadronic showers are simulated with the Quark Gluon String (QGSP) model [35] (instead of FTFP) and the Binary Intranuclear Cascade (BIC) [36] model (instead of the BERTini cascade).
* _FTFP_BERT_BIC:_ A variant of FTFP_BERT which handles proton- and neutron-nucleus inelastic interactions below 5 GeV and pions-nucleus inelastic interactions below 1.3 GeV using the BIC model, while the BERT model is used for the rest.
* _FTFP_BERT_Rescattering:_ A variant of FTFP_BERT which uses the BIC model only for rescattering.

The signal and background samples have different \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) and pileup distributions, so event weights are calculated and the distributions for signal and hadronic top production are re-weighted to match the multi-jet distributions.

## 3 Object selection, association, and flavor labeling

The selection, the matching criteria or association, and the determination of the heavy flavor content of physics objects for this analysis are described below.

**Calorimeter Jets:** The standard inputs to calorimeter jet reconstruction in ATLAS are topological clusters of calorimeter cell energy depositions [32]. The clusters are considered massless, and are calibrated using the local cluster weight (LCW) method [37]. In this analysis, calorimeter jets reconstructed using FastJet[38; 39] with the anti-\(k_{t}\) algorithm [40] with distance parameter \(R\)=1.0 ("large-\(R\)" jets) are used. The trimming algorithm [41], adopted by ATLAS as the standard grooming procedure for anti-\(k_{t}\) jets with \(R=1.0\), discards the softer components of the jet including contributions from pile-up and underlying event. For trimming, \(k_{t}\) subjets with \(R_{\mathrm{sub}}=0.2\) are used with \(f_{\mathrm{cut}}=0.05\)1. After this groomingprocedure, the jet energy and mass are calibrated using particle-level correction factors derived from simulation [14]. The calibration procedure is described in detail in Ref. [31]. Only jets with \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>250\) GeV and pseudorapidity 2\(|\eta|<2.0\), and mass, after the jet energy calibration, above 50 GeV are considered in this analysis.

Footnote 2: A detailed description of the ATLAS detector can be found in Ref. [1]. ATLAS uses a right-handed coordinate system with its origin at the nominal interaction point in the centre of the detector, and the \(z\) axis along the beam line. The \(x\) axis points to the center of the LHC ring, and the \(y\) axis points upwards. Cylindrical coordinates \((r,\phi)\) are used in the transverse plane, with \(\phi\) being the azimuthal angle around the beam line. The pseudorapidity \(\eta\) is defined in terms of the polar angle \(\theta\) as \(\eta=-\ln\tan(\theta/2)\).

**Truth Jets**: Truth jets are built in simulated events from truth particles with lifetimes greater than 10 picoseconds, except for muons and neutrinos which are not included. The same jet clustering algorithm used for the calorimeter jets is used for building truth jets.

**Track Jets**: Track jets are reconstructed from inner detector tracks using the anti-\(k_{t}\) algorithm with a distance parameters of \(R=0.2\)[10]. The tracks are required to have:

* \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>0.4\) GeV and \(|\eta|<2.5\);
* at least 7 hits in the silicon detectors (pixel detector + silicon strip detector);
* no more than one hit in the pixel detector that is shared by multiple tracks;
* no more than one missing hit in the pixel detector (where a hit is expected), and no more than two missing hits in the silicon detectors (where a hit is expected);
* tight match to the hard scatter vertex by requiring that the track is a constituent of the reconstructed hard scatter vertex, or the track longitudinal impact parameter with respect to the hard scatter vertex, \(z_{0}\), satisfies \(|z_{0}\sin(\theta)|<3\) mm, where \(\theta\) is the track polar angle.

Such requirements greatly reduce the number of tracks from pileup vertices whilst being highly efficient for tracks from the hard scatter vertex3. Only track jets with \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>10\) GeV, \(|\eta|<2.5\), and with at least two tracks are used for the analysis. The \(b\)-tagging efficiency of track jets was calibrated using Run 1 \(t\bar{t}\) candidate data events. This calibration is used for this analysis with additional uncertainties that account for the new detector description, conditions, and expected reconstruction efficiencies and resolutions, as discussed in Section 7.2.

Footnote 3: The hard scatter vertex is the reconstructed collision vertex with the highest sum \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{2}\) of tracks used to form the vertex.

**Muons**: Muons, following standard recommendations, are reconstructed from a combination of measurements from the inner detector and the muon spectrometer. They are required to have \(\geq 3\) hits on at least two layers of monitored drift tubes (MDT), except for the \(|\eta|<0.1\) region where tracks with at least three hits in one single MDT layer are allowed. Moreover, the difference between the inner detector and muon spectrometer \(1/p\) measurements is required to be below 7 standard deviations. Muons selected for this analysis are required to have \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>10\) GeV and \(|\eta|<2.4\).

**Ghost Association:** In events with a dense hadronic environment, there can often be an ambiguity when matching track jets to calorimeter jets. The track jet association to large-\(R\) jets is performed using ghost-association [12, 13, 14], which provides a robust matching procedure that makes use of the catchment area of the jet [12]. As a result, matching to jets with irregular boundaries can be achieved in a less ambiguous way than a simple geometric (i.e. \(\Delta R\)4 between objects) matching. In this procedure, the "ghosts" are the track jet 4-vectors in the event, with the track jet \(p_{\rm T}\) set to an infinitesimal amount, essentially only retaining the direction of the track jets. This ensures that jet reconstruction is not altered by the ghosts when the calorimeter clusters plus ghosts are reclustered. The reclustering is then performed using the anti-\(k_{t}\) algorithm with \(R=1.0\). The calorimeter jets after reclustering are identical to the ungroomed parents of the trimmed jets used in this analysis, with the addition of the associated track jets retained as constituents. In this analysis, track jets ghost-associated to the large-\(R\) jet refers to track jets found this way within the catchment area of the ungroomed parent jet, but the kinematics of the large-\(R\) jet are still measured using the trimmed jet.

**Jet Flavor Labeling:** The labeling of the flavor of the track jets in simulation is done by geometrically matching the jet with generator-level hadrons: if a weakly decaying \(b\)-hadron is found within \(\Delta R<0.3\) of the jet direction, where \(R\) is the jet distance parameter, the jet is labeled as a \(b\)-jet. In the case that the \(b\)-hadron could match more than one jet, only the closest jet is labeled as a \(b\)-jet. If no \(b\)-hadron is found, the procedure is repeated for weakly decaying \(c\)-hadrons to label \(c\)-jets. If no \(c\)-hadron is found, the procedure is repeated for \(\tau\) leptons to label \(\tau\)-jets. A jet for which no such association can be made is labeled as a light-flavor jet. A geometric matching is used for track jet flavor labeling for consistency with the track association for \(b\)-tagging (described in Section 5), which also uses geometric matching.

The flavor labeling for large-\(R\) jets is also important for this analysis to define the Higgs-jet signal and background efficiencies but also to study their flavor composition. Higgs-jets are defined as large-\(R\) jets with a truth Higgs boson and the corresponding two decay \(b\)-hadrons ghost associated to its untrimmed jet area. Top jets are defined as large-\(R\) jets in which a truth top quark is ghost associated to the untrimmed jet area. The large-\(R\) jet's flavor composition (for Higgs-jets, QCD jets and hadronic top jets) is denoted by the number of weakly decaying \(b\)- and \(c\)-hadrons that are ghost associated to the jet.

## 4 Jets and substructure description

Jet grooming algorithms enhance the discriminating power between jets from hadronic boson decays, and those from multi-jet production and hadronic top production by improving the jet mass resolution relative to ungroomed jets [14]. The performance of some of these methods has been explored previously in the context of hadronic two body and three body particle decays [31, 42, 43]. Only a subset of substructure variables, computed using the constituents of the large-\(R\) jet, that are found to be the most discriminant for the purpose of Higgs-jet tagging were used in this study:

* \(C_{2}^{(\beta=1)}\)[44]: ratios of the two and three point energy correlation functions, which are based on the energies and pair-wise angles of particles within a jet and sensitive to two and three-prong substructure, respectively.
* \(D_{2}^{(\beta=1)}\)[45]: more recent modified version of \(C_{2}^{(\beta=1)}\). It optimizes the separation between one-prong and two-prong decays.
* \(\tau_{21}^{\rm wta}\)[46]: ratios of the jet shape "N-subjettiness", sensitive to what degree the substructure of a given jet resembles two or one subjets. The "winner takes all" method of defining internal axes is used [47].

A detailed description for these substructure variables can be found in Ref. [31].

## 5 Flavor tagging description

Several algorithms to identify \(b\)-jets have been developed. They range from relatively simple algorithms based on impact parameter (IP3D) and secondary vertex (SV1) information to the more refined JetFitter algorithm, which exploits the topology of weak \(b\)- and \(c\)-hadron decays using a Kalman filter to search for a common line connecting the primary vertex to beauty and charm decay vertices. These algorithms have been documented in Ref. [48].

The algorithms take tracks associated to a jet as input, which are not the same set of tracks used in the track jet clustering. Once the track jet axis is determined, a second step of track association is performed to select tracks with looser impact parameter requirements in order to collect the tracks needed for effectively running the \(b\)-tagging algorithms.

The MV2c20 algorithm [49] employs a boosted decision tree based on jet properties and properties computed from IP3D, SV1 and JetFitter. It is trained with \(b\)-jets as signal, and a mix of approximately 80% light-flavor jets and 20% \(c\)-jets as background. The multivariate \(b\)-tagging algorithms have been trained using calorimeter jets, but they are used for both calorimeter and track jets. If a dedicated re-training of the MV2 algorithm for track jets were undertaken it would be expected to improve the track jet \(b\)-tagging performance.

The efficiency calibrations of the \(b\)-tagging algorithm are typically performed in the case when fixed thresholds are applied to the tag weights computed by the \(b\)-tagging algorithms. These fixed thresholds or "working points" (WP) are tuned to obtain specified \(b\)-jet efficiencies based on the inclusive \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) and \(\eta\) spectra of jets from an inclusive \(t\bar{t}\) sample. Within this note, emphasis will be placed on WPs which are tuned to an average 70% or 85% \(b\)-tagging efficiency.

## 6 Results: Higgs-jet tagger efficiencies and rejections

In this section, the performance of track jets \(b\)-tagging, the use of a window around the Higgs boson mass peak, and the use of jet substructure information are studied in terms of Higgs-jets efficiency and background rejection. Several benchmark Higgs-jets tagging selections are defined based on the current supported \(b\)-tagging algorithm WPs and on specific Higgs-jet efficiency targets. Three benchmark selections are optimized: one loose and one medium, in addition to one tight selection that is also designed to have a flat signal efficiency as a function of the Higgs-jet \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\).

The first step in identifying boosted Higgs bosons is the large-\(R\) jet reconstruction. The acceptance of this reconstruction step, defined as the fraction of truth Higgs bosons with \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>250\) GeV, \(|\eta|<2.0\), and with \(b\)-hadrons from the Higgs boson decay with \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>5\) GeV and \(|\eta|<2.5\), that are reconstructed with the baseline large-\(R\) jet selection and labeled as a Higgs-jet5, is shown as a function of truth Higgs boson \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) in Figure 1. At low \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\sim 250\) GeV, the acceptance is \(\sim 20\%\) because only Higgs bosons traveling nearly transverse to its decay axis (in the Higgs boson center of mass frame) will result in decay products that are collimated within \(\Delta R\lesssim 1.0\), i.e. within a single large-\(R\) jet. This acceptance increases rapidly with Higgs boson \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\), reaching more than 80% for \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>450\) GeV.

Footnote 5: Both the large-\(R\) baseline selection and the Higgs-jet labeling criteria are defined in Section 3.

For large-\(R\) jets passing the baseline selection from Section 3, the distributions of large-\(R\) jet \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) and of the number of ghost associated track jets per large-\(R\) jet are shown in Figure 2. A broad range of large-jet \(p_{\rm T}\) is covered by both the signal and background distributions. As is expected, the \(p_{\rm T}\) distributions for the jets in higher mass RSG samples tend to be harder than the background samples, and the Higgs-jets tend to have a larger fraction of jets with exactly two matched track jets. For later performance figures and optimizations, the signal samples are summed together and reweighted to the \(p_{\rm T}\) distribution of the multi-jet sample. The same procedure is applied to the hadronic \(t\bar{t}\) samples. This \(p_{\rm T}\) reweighting changes the \(\eta\) distribution of the Higgs-jets due to an underlying correlation of \(p_{\rm T}\) and \(\eta\) for Higgs-jets produced from a 2-body decay.

In the following Sections, the Higgs-jet (background) efficiency is computed as the number of Higgs-jets (background jets) passing a given selection requirement (i.e. a requirement on top of the baseline selection, such as \(b\)-tagging, large-\(R\) jet mass, and large-\(R\) jet substructure variables) divided by the total

Figure 1: The truth Higgs boson acceptance, or the fraction of truth Higgs bosons with \(p_{\rm T}>250\) GeV, \(|\eta|<2.0\), and with \(b\)-hadrons from the Higgs boson decay with \(p_{\rm T}>5\) GeV and \(|\eta|<2.5\), that are reconstructed with the baseline large-\(R\) jet selection and labeled as a Higgs-jet

number of Higgs-jets (background jets) passing the baseline selection described in Section 3. The background rejection is defined as the inverse of the efficiency for a background jet to pass the requirement.

### \(b\)-tagging Performance

The \(b\)-tagging for large-\(R\) jets is performed by means of the ghost associated track jets. The track jets are always ordered by \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\), and only the leading two track jets are used for \(b\)-tagging. A track jet is considered to have passed the \(b\)-tagging requirement if the track jet's MV2c20 \(b\)-tagging weight, \(w_{b-\mathrm{tag}}\), is larger than a threshold value, \(w_{X}\). The value of \(w_{X}\) can be scanned to examine the background rejection as a function of Higgs-jet efficiency for different \(b\)-tagging requirements.

Several different \(b\)-tagging requirements on the track jets are examined:

* _double \(b\)-tagging_: both two leading \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) track jets must pass the same \(b\)-tagging requirement of having \(w_{b-\mathrm{tag}}>w_{X}\).
* _single \(b\)-tagging_: only the leading \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) track jet must pass the \(b\)-tagging requirement of having \(w_{b-\mathrm{tag}}>w_{X}\).
* _Asymmetric (Asymm.) \(b\)-tagging_: Of the two leading \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) track jets, the track jet with the largest \(b\)-tagging weight must pass the fixed 70% \(b\)-tagging working point threshold, \(w_{b-\mathrm{tag}}>w_{70\%}\), while the \(b\)-tagging requirement of the other jet is varied.

The Higgs-jet efficiency versus the inclusive multi-jet rejection can be found in Figure 2(a), where the performance of double \(b\)-tagging, single \(b\)-tagging, and asymmetric \(b\)-tagging is shown. None of the curves reach a Higgs-jet efficiency of 100% due to the imperfect efficiency to reconstruct the track jets needed for \(b\)-tagging and, in the case of asymmetric \(b\)-tagging, due also to the 70% \(b\)-tagging working point requirement on one of the track jets.

For high Higgs-jet efficiencies, above \(\sim 80\%\), the single \(b\)-tagging approach tends to have a better multi-jet rejection than the double \(b\)-tagging, while for lower Higgs-jet efficiency the double \(b\)-tagging approach provides a significantly higher multi-jet rejection. Finally, the asymmetric \(b\)-tagging option is seen to capture much of the benefits of double \(b\)-tagging in the low Higgs-jet efficiency regime, while being significantly better than both single and double \(b\)-tagging in the high Higgs-jet efficiency regime. While Figure 2(a) includes all large-\(R\) jets with \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>250\) GeV, the aforementioned performance features of each of the possible \(b\)-tagging requirements is similar when examining the Higgs-jet efficiency versus the multi-jet rejection in different regions of large-\(R\) jet \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\).

The multi-jet sample can be broken down by the number of \(b\)- and \(c\)- hadrons within the large-\(R\) jet in order to understand the performance for the different categories. Figure 2(b) shows the multi-jet rejection versus Higgs-jet efficiency for each flavor composition of light-flavor, single-\(c\), single-\(b\), double-\(b\), double-\(c\), and \(bc\) large-\(R\) jets from multi-jet production when using double \(b\)-tagging. One can see that the rejection of light-flavor large-\(R\) jets is largest, followed by single-\(c\), and single-\(b\) large-\(R\) jets, due to the fact that two \(b\)-tagged track jets are required. The lowest background rejection is against double-\(b\) large-\(R\) jets, which is not surprising as the two \(b\)-hadrons within these large-\(R\) jets should have high \(b\)-tagging efficiencies. The rejection of double-\(b\) large-\(R\) jets derives from: (1) difficulties in identifying multiple \(b\)-jets in low mass large-\(R\) jets with small angular separation between the \(b\)-hadrons, and (2) inefficiencies in \(b\)-tagging at low \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) in the case of a large \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) asymmetry between well separated \(b\)-jets.

Another common background to boosted Higgs boson searches are boosted hadronic top-quark decays. The inclusive hadronic top jet rejection versus the Higgs-jet efficiency can be found in Figure 3(a), where the performance of double \(b\)-tagging, single \(b\)-tagging and asymmetric \(b\)-tagging is shown. Double and asymmetric \(b\)-tagging perform similarly and both provide significantly better rejection than single \(b\)-tagging with no significant loss in Higgs-jet efficiency. While Figure 3(a) includes all large-\(R\) jets with \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>250\) GeV, the aforementioned performance features of each of the possible \(b\)-tagging requirements is similar when examining the Higgs-jet efficiency versus the hadronic top rejection in different regions of large-\(R\) jet \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\). The hadronic top jet rejection versus the Higgs-jet efficiency for double \(b\)-tagging with the hadronic top jets broken down by the number of \(b\)- and \(c\)-hadrons found in the large-\(R\) top jet can be seen in Figure 3(b). A large fraction of top jets is rejected by the double-\(b\)-tagging requirement, however the hadronic top jets containing both a \(b\)- and \(c\)-hadron are rejected at a significantly lower rate than other flavors of hadronic top jets.

At present only the 70% \(b\)-tagging efficiency WP is calibrated for track jets and it is used for this analysis. In consequence the asymmetric \(b\)-tagging option is not available.

### Mass Window Determination

The groomed jet mass is an important component in tagging boson jets [9]. A mass window requirement, selecting a range of masses around the Higgs boson mass, is applied. The smallest windows containing 68% and 90% of the groomed Higgs-jet mass distributions are identified.

Before choosing the mass window, one can notice that in addition to detector smearing, the mass resolution of Higgs-jets is degraded due to the semi-leptonic decays of the \(b\)-hadrons produced in Higgs boson

(b): Multi-jet rejection versus Higgs-jet efficiency using all large-\(R\) jets with \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>250\) GeV, broken down by multi-jet flavor composition, using double \(b\)-tagging.

None of the curves reach a Higgs-jet efficiency of 100% due to the imperfect efficiency to reconstruct the track jets needed for \(b\)-tagging and in the case of asymmetric \(b\)-tagging the 70% \(b\)-tagging working point requirement on one of the track jets.

decays. The semi-leptonic decays lead to the production of neutrinos, which are not directly measured in ATLAS, electrons, which are measured in the calorimeter and inner detector, and muons, which are not measured in the calorimeter but are measured in the inner detector and muon spectrometer. As it is difficult to identify the calorimeter depositions of electrons within jets, and neutrinos are not measured directly by the detector, only the muon from the semi-leptonic decays of \(b\)-hadrons are considered. The effect of the semi-leptonic decays to muons is corrected by finding muons within \(\Delta R<0.2\) of the \(b\)-tagged track jets and adding the four vector of these muons to that of the large-\(R\) jet. If more than one muon is found within a track jet, only the muon closest to the track jet axis is considered. The mass distributions of the large-\(R\) jets are shown in Figure 5 before and after the muon correction in two large-\(R\) jet \(p_{T}\) ranges. A clear improvement in mass resolution for the Higgs-jets is observed at low Higgs-jet \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\), while the improvement is not as significant at higher Higgs-jet \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\).

The mass distribution after the muon correction for Higgs-jets, multi-jet production, and hadronic top jets, is shown in Figure 6 in two large-\(R\) jet \(p_{T}\) bins. There is not a significant peak at the \(W\) boson mass of 80 in the hadronic top jet mass distributions because of the double \(b\)-tagging requirement. In terms of \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\)-dependence, the peak of the mass distribution is quite stable within 4% as a function of \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\), after jet mass calibration. In addition, the width of the core of the mass distribution decreases with \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\), but high mass tails are observed at high \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>\)1000.

### Jet Substructure Variables in the Higgs-jet Tagger

In addition to the heavy flavor content of the large-\(R\) jet, and the jet mass, the internal structure of the jet can be used to discriminate Higgs-jets from multi-jet production and hadronic top decays. There are

(b): Hadronic top jet rejection versus Higgs-jet efficiency using all large-\(R\) jets with \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>250\), broken down by hadronic top jet flavor composition, using double \(b\)-tagging. The stars correspond to a 70% \(b\)-tagging WP. The bands represent the statistical uncertainties. No star is seen for the light-flavor curve as the statistics of the sample were not sufficient to reach this point. Note that none of the curves reach a Higgs-jet efficiency of 100% due to the imperfect efficiency to reconstruct the track jets needed for \(b\)-tagging and in the case of asymmetric \(b\)-tagging the 70% \(b\)-tagging working point requirement on one of the track jets.

Figure 5: The calibrated mass distribution for large-\(R\) trimmed double \(b\)-tagged jets before and after the muon correction for Higgs-jets is shown in the large-\(R\) jet transverse momentum ranges \(350~{}\text{GeV}<p_{\text{T}}<500~{}\text{GeV}\) and \(1000~{}\text{GeV}<p_{\text{T}}<1500~{}\text{GeV}\). Higgs bosons are simulated with a mass of \(125~{}\text{GeV}\). All jets, whether they have a close-by muon or not, are used.

Higgs bosons are simulated with a mass of \(125~{}\text{GeV}\).

a large number of substructure variables that capture features of a jet's internal structure. A subset of variables defined in Section 4 is used here: \(C_{2}^{(\beta=1)}\), \(D_{2}^{(\beta=1)}\), and \(\tau_{21}^{\rm wta}\). Their distribution for Higgs-jets, multi-jet production, and hadronic top jets can be seen in Figure 7. In the distributions for all three variables, there are larger difference between the Higgs-jets and the multi-jet distributions than between the Higgs-jets and the hadronic top jet distributions. This is not only observed inclusively in large-\(R\) jet \(p_{\rm T}\), but also when examining these distributions in different ranges of large-\(R\) jet \(p_{\rm T}\).

Several variables are compared in Figures 8 and 9 in terms of their rejection power against multi-jet production and hadronic top jets, respectively, in two different ranges of large-\(R\) jet \(p_{\rm T}\). The curve labeled "Double \(b\)-tagging" shows the performance of varying only the double \(b\)-tagging requirement after the 68% mass window requirement. The stars in the figures indicate the performance after a 68% mass window requirement and a fixed \(b\)-tagging requirement of 70% or 85%. The curves for the different substructure variables are produced by varying only the substructure requirements after the mass and fixed \(b\)-tagging requirements are applied. The addition of substructure variable requirements to the tagger improves rejection power against multi-jet production, especially in the lower Higgs-jet efficiency region below \(\sim\)30%. At higher Higgs-jet efficiencies, which can be achieved when using looser \(b\)-tagging working points such as the 85% WP, the gains from adding substructure variables to the tagger are not as large. It can also be seen that the performance gains from the different substructure variables are quite similar.

A better hadronic top jet rejection for a fixed Higgs-jet efficiency can be achieved by requiring more stringent \(b\)-tagging requirements than can be achieved by adding substructure requirements in addition to a fixed \(b\)-tagging requirement. While only two \(p_{\rm T}\) ranges are shown in Figure 9, this behavior was observed in all \(p_{\rm T}\) ranges considered in this analysis and also when combining substructure discrimination with several different \(b\)-tagging working points.

The performance of single \(b\)-tagging combined with substructure information is not shown because the background rejection was observed to be significantly lower than that of the double \(b\)-tagging combined with substructure. However, at high track jet \(p_{\rm T}\gtrsim 300\) GeV, the uncertainties on the calibration of the \(b\)-tagging efficiency can be large, and thus the usage of only single \(b\)-tagging may reduce uncertainties on a Higgs-jet tagger at high \(p_{\rm T}\), making this an interesting option for certain analyses.

Among the variables examined, \(D_{2}^{(\beta=1)}\) tends to bring slightly better rejection improvements than other variables. It is interesting to note that a similar conclusion was seen in boosted \(W/Z\) boson tagging studies in both Run 1 [9] and Run 2 [31].

In order to have a Higgs-jet tagging efficiency that does not vary with \(p_{\rm T}\), as many analyses find helpful, the double tagging and mass window requirement can be combined with \(p_{\rm T}\)-dependent selections on the variable \(D_{2}^{(\beta=1)}\). The \(p_{\rm T}\)-dependent requirement is smoothed using a polynomial fit in order to reduce bin-edge effect. A 25% efficiency can only be achieved up to \(p_{\rm T}\lesssim 800\) GeV, while above \(p_{\rm T}=800\) GeV it is not possible to reach 25% efficiency because the \(b\)-tagging efficiency is strongly dependent on \(p_{\rm T}\). Therefore, the requirement on \(D_{2}^{(\beta=1)}\) is not applied for jets with \(p_{\rm T}>800\) GeV for a 70% \(b\)-tagging WP and 68% mass window.

Figure 10 shows the Higgs-jet efficiency and background rejection for multi-jet and hadronic top events as a function of \(p_{\rm T}\) after applying the \(D_{2}^{(\beta=1)}\) requirement for the 70% \(b\)-tagging WP. After applying the double \(b\)-tagging requirement, the Higgs-jet efficiency drops to below the target 25% efficiency above \(p_{\rm T}=800\) GeV. This could be compensated by using a looser \(b\)-tagging WP in order to obtain a fixed Higgs-jet efficiency up to higher jet \(p_{\rm T}\). The lower Higgs-jet efficiency observed at low \(p_{\rm T}\), after requiring two \(b\)-tagged track jets, is related with the \(p_{\rm T}\) distribution of track jets within the large-\(R\) jet and the lower \(b\)-tagging efficiency for low \(p_{\rm T}\) track jets.

### Summary of Grooming and Substructure Combinations

A summary of the benchmark Higgs-jet tagging selections can be found in Table 1. These benchmark values provide a range of Higgs-jet efficiencies and background rejections that can be tested directly for use in analyses. A table listing the efficiency and rejections, including uncertainties, of the different tagger selections can be found in Section 7.3.

## 7 Results: Systematic uncertainties

To estimate the systematic uncertainties of the Higgs-jet tagger performance, the uncertainties on the inputs to the Higgs-jet tagger are propagated through the tagger selection. More specifically, the \(b\)-tagging efficiency and the jet mass, \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\), and \(D_{2}^{(\beta=1)}\) scale and resolutions are varied within their uncertainties. These input uncertainties lead to changes in the efficiency and / or acceptance of the Higgs-jet tagger selection, and thus provide an estimate of the systematics uncertainties of the Higgs-jet efficiency and background rejection. In general, the approach followed to estimate the systematic uncertainties on the inputs consists in using the uncertainties from Run 1 data taking as a baseline and adding extra uncertainties to extrapolate from Run 1 to Run 2. These extra systematic uncertainties are derived from variations in the detector conditions and high \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) physics (variations on jet fragmentation and on the models used to describe detector interactions affecting high \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) jets, for which in-situ studies from Run 1 are not available) simulated in Monte Carlo to take into account the limited knowledge of the Run 2 conditions. No theoretical uncertainties on the signal have been considered in this study.

### Jet related systematic uncertainties

#### 7.1.1 Jet mass, \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) and \(D_{2}^{(\beta=1)}\) scale systematic uncertainties

The jet mass, \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) and \(D_{2}^{(\beta=1)}\) scale uncertainties from Run 1 derived from in-situ comparisons between \(\sqrt{s}=8\) and simulation are used as the baseline systematic uncertainties [9]. These uncertainties were derived for large-\(R\) jets with \(p_{\mathrm{T}}<\)1 TeV. In addition, Run 1 to Run 2 extrapolation systematic uncertainties to account for the limited understanding of the detector description and conditions for Run 2 are estimated for jets with \(p_{\mathrm{T}}<1\) using five multi-jet simulation samples with different detector variations (see Section 2 for more information): two variations accounting for differing calorimeter noise thresholds, one for bunch crossing differences, one for the LAr signal treatment and one for changes in the topological cluster reconstruction technique.

The uncertainties for jets with \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>\)1 TeV can not be extrapolated from Run 1, therefore they are calculated by using one sample with different fragmentation and underlying event modelling (Herwig++), two

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|c|} \hline Selection & double \(b\)-tagging & large-\(R\) jet Mass & \(D_{2}^{(\beta=1)}\) \\ \hline \hline Loose & 70\% WP & 90\% window, \(m\in[76,146]\) GeV & - \\ Medium & 70\% WP & 68\% window, \(m\in[93,134]\) GeV & - \\ Tight & 70\% WP & 68\% window, \(m\in[93,134]\) GeV & \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\)-dependent cut \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 1: Criteria used for the different Higgs-jet tagging selections.

variations accounting for differing calorimeter noise thresholds, one for bunch crossing differences and three additional variations focused on the GEANT4 description of intra-nuclear processes in the detector materials for high-\(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) jets. The fragmentation and underlying event modeling uncertainty is present for the lower \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) jets already as it is used in the calculation of the Run 1 systematic uncertainties. No explicit variations of the detector geometry are included in these studies, but previous studies showed a 1-2% effect on the jet energy and mass scale [50].

Technically, the derivation of the Run 1 to Run 2 extrapolation uncertainties on a jet related quantity, \(X\), is performed by studying differences in the jet response between the variation simulated samples and the nominal sample. The response of a variable \(X\) is defined on a jet-by-jet basis as ( reconstructed jet \(X\) ) / ( reference jet \(X\) ), where there is a requirement that \(\Delta R\)(reference, reconstructed)\(<0.7\). Truth jets are used as reference jets. The \(X\) response distribution is then fitted with a Gaussian function, from which the mean can be extracted. Each Run 1 to Run 2 extrapolation uncertainty is calculated from \((Variation/Nominal-1)\times 100(\%)\) where \(Nominal\) is the mean of the jet response in the nominal samples and \(Variation\) is the same for a given variation simulated sample. The uncertainties are derived in regions of large-\(R\) truth jet \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) and the ratio of \(m/p_{\mathrm{T}}\) as measured by the reconstructed large-\(R\) jet, and are shown in Figures 11 through 13 for the calibrated jet \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\), mass and \(D_{2}^{(\beta=1)}\).

The baseline Run 1 uncertainties were derived using track jets as reference jets and comparing the responses in data and MC simulation [9]. In both the baseline and the Run 1 to Run 2 extrapolation uncertainties, the uncertainty on the mass and \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) are derived without any requirements on the jet mass or \(D_{2}^{(\beta=1)}\), in order to account for migrations of jets into and out of the mass window. The uncertainties on \(D_{2}^{(\beta=1)}\) are derived before and after the 68% mass window requirement, but only the systematic uncertainties without the mass window are used because the statistical uncertainties were seen to be large after applying the mass window.

The Run 1 to Run 2 extrapolation systematic uncertainties on the jet \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) scale are dominated by the uncertainties coming from the increase of the noise thresholds for large-\(R\) jet \(p_{\mathrm{T}}<1\) and the different physics variations for large-\(R\) jet \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>1\) and they vary between 4% for low \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) and 2% for high \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\). The same systematic uncertainty sources dominate the jet mass scale uncertainties. Mass scale uncertainties of up to 4% are observed for jets with \(p_{\mathrm{T}}<350\), while for higher-\(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) jets they vary between 5% at low \(m/p_{\mathrm{T}}\) and 2% at high \(m/p_{\mathrm{T}}\). Most of the variations result in uncertainties on the \(D_{2}^{(\beta=1)}\) scale of less than 1%, except for jet with \(m/p_{\mathrm{T}}<0.1\) where the impact of the QGSP_BIC physics variation for high \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) can increase up to 6%. The uncertainties on the \(D_{2}^{(\beta=1)}\) scale increases from 1-2% to up to 3% after the 68% mass window requirement for mass/\(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) between 0.1 and 0.6, but they are limited by the number of events after the mass window requirement.

The uncertainties on the variables are derived without applying any \(b\)-tagging requirements due to limited statistics in the MC samples with the aforementioned variations. However, without a \(b\)-tagging requirement, the flavor composition of the multi-jet sample is significantly different from the Higgs-jets and background jets passing the Higgs-jet tagger selection which typically contain two heavy flavored hadrons. In addition, the double \(b\)-tagging requirement may affect the large-\(R\) jet substructure through the requirements of at least two relatively hard track jets and through the track jet \(b\)-tagging efficiency which is \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\)-dependent. Therefore, an additional "flavor composition uncertainty" is estimated to take into account differences between the inclusive multi-jet sample, and samples of jets enriched with heavy flavor hadrons. A conservative approach is chosen and the difference in the response of the jet related variables between the inclusive nominal multi-jet sample and Higgs boson signal sample passing the double \(b\)-tagging requirement, as seen in Figure 14, is taken as this additional uncertainty. In order to ensure this approach is valid for varying flavor compositions and jets passing varying selection requirements, the response variation is also computed for double \(b\)-tagged jets from the multi-jet sample, as well as for double \(b\)-tagged jets passing the 68% mass window requirement in both Higgs and multi-jet samples. In all cases, the variations are within the variation seen in Figure 14.

The effect of the jet mass, \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) and \(D_{2}^{(\beta=1)}\) scale systematic uncertainties on the Higgs-jet efficiency and background rejection is then evaluated treating the uncertainties of the three variables as fully correlated for each variation. For each source of systematic uncertainty, the uncertainty on the Higgs-jet and background efficiency is determined by shifting simultaneously the jet \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\), mass and \(D_{2}^{(\beta=1)}\) variables by the respective ratio of responses (\(Variation/Nominal\)). This shift in the scales and resolution thus affect the acceptance of the mass, \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) and \(D_{2}^{(\beta=1)}\) requirements of the Higgs-jet tagger, and thus change the predicted tagging efficiency and rejection. To calculate the total uncertainty on the Higgs-jet and background efficiency, the different detector variations and the uncertainties from previous data-taking are assumed to be uncorrelated and added in quadrature.

#### 7.1.2 Jet mass, \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) and \(D_{2}^{(\beta=1)}\) resolution systematic uncertainties

Uncertainties on the jet \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\), mass and \(D_{2}^{(\beta=1)}\) resolutions can also impact the the Higgs-jet and background tagging efficiency. For a jet related variable \(X\), the resolution of \(X\), denoted \(\sigma_{X}\), is defined as the standard deviation parameter determined from the fit to the response distribution. The relative uncertainty on this resolution parameter, \(r_{X}\), coming from Run 1 studies [50] was approximately 20% for the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\), 20% for the mass, and 10% for \(D_{2}^{(\beta=1)}\). These relative uncertainties are implemented by applying a Gaussian smearing to the variable \(X\) randomly for each jet such that the total resolution of the distribution of \(X\) increases to \((1+r_{X})\times\sigma_{X}\). The resolution uncertainties for the jet mass, \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) and \(D_{2}^{(\beta=1)}\) are derived in regions of large-\(R\) truth jet \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\).

As an additional cross-check, the dependence of the jet \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\), mass and \(D_{2}^{(\beta=1)}\) resolution was studied using the variation samples described in Section 2. These tests indicate that the aforementioned resolution uncertainties coming from Run 1 studies cover the observed resolution variations.

The effect of the jet mass, \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) and \(D_{2}^{(\beta=1)}\) resolution systematic uncertainties on the Higgs-jet efficiency and background rejection is then evaluated treating the uncertainties of the three variables as fully uncorrelated. The resolution uncertainty on the Higgs-jet and background efficiency is determined by smearing the jet \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\), mass and \(D_{2}^{(\beta=1)}\) variables with the respective multiplicative factors of

\[\left(\ 1+\mathcal{G}\bigg{[}0,\sigma_{X}\sqrt{(r_{x}+1)^{2}-1}\bigg{]}\ \right)\]

where \(\mathcal{G}\) is a Gaussian distribution with mean 0 and standard deviation (\(\sigma_{X}\sqrt{(r_{x}+1)^{2}-1}\)), which is randomly sampled for each jet. This change in the resolution will thus affect the acceptance of the mass, \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) and \(D_{2}^{(\beta=1)}\) requirements of the Higgs-jet tagger, and thus change the predicted tagging efficiency and rejection.

Five standard systematic variations on the MC simulation, described in Section 2, are used to derive each contribution to the systematic uncertainty for jets with \(p_{\rm T}<1\) TeV. Two additional variations are included for high \(p_{\rm T}\) jets (\(>1\) TeV). The total variation band represents the symmetrized quadratic sum of the individual variations.

### \(b\)-tagging related systematic uncertainties

The in-situ \(b\)-tagging calibration scale factors and corresponding systematic uncertainties derived in 2012 data, in dileptonic \(t\bar{t}\) events [51], for track jets with \(10\leq p_{\mathrm{T}}\leq 250\) GeV are used as preliminary calibrations of the \(b\)-tagging efficiency for early Run 2 simulation. For track jets with \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>250\) GeV, no in-situ calibration is available, and the in-situ calibration and its uncertainty from track jets with \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) in the range between 100 and 250 GeV are used, albeit with additional high-\(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) uncertainties extracted from MC simulation. The uncertainties on the in-situ calibration come from several sources including uncertainties in the detector response and resolution, and the modeling of the heavy quark fragmentation in MC, and range from approximately 3% for track jets with \(20<p_{\mathrm{T}}<100\) GeV to 6-8% at lower and higher \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\). The additional \(b\)-tagging uncertainties for high \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>250\) GeV jets come from uncertainties on track impact parameter and momentum resolutions, and tracking efficiencies and fake rates in high-\(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) jets, and range from \(\sim 9\%\) for track jets with \(250<p_{\mathrm{T}}<400\) GeV to \(\sim 23\%\) for track jets with \(600<p_{\mathrm{T}}<900\) GeV. The high-\(p_{\mathrm{T}}\)\(b\)-tagging uncertainties are treated as independent of the in-situ calibration uncertainties.

The 2012 data based \(b\)-tagging calibrations for charm and light-flavor jets were only available for calorimeter jets [52] and not for track jets. These calorimeter jet calibrations were performed in bins of \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\). Thus, in order to apply the calorimeter jet calibrations for the track jets, one must account for the neutral component of the jet which is missing in track jets but measured in calorimeter jets. As such, a linear \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\)-scaling derived from the average calorimeter jet \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) per track jet \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\), computed from track jets matched to calorimeter jets, was used to determine the appropriate calorimeter calibration \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\)-bin for each track jet. To account for possible differences in \(b\)-tagging calibration between track jets and calorimeter jets, an additional 20% relative uncertainty for charm jets and an additional 50% relative uncertainty for light-flavor jets is used, and treated as independent of the in-situ calibration uncertainties. The calibration uncertainties for the different jet flavors are treated as uncorrelated.

Additional Run 1 to Run 2 extrapolation uncertainties quantify the impact on the \(b\)-tagging efficiency of changes between Run 2 and Run 1 in tracking efficiencies and fake rates, impact parameter resolution smearing due to inner detector misalignment, resolution effects due to dead pixel modules, and temperature variations of the IBL detector. These uncertainties are on the order of 5% for \(b\)-jets, 10% for \(c\)-jets, and 40% for light-flavor jets. These additional extrapolation uncertainties are treated as independent of the 2012 data-based calibration uncertainties, the additional high-\(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) uncertainties, and the uncertainties accounting for possible difference between track jets and calorimeter jets.

Many of the \(b\)-tagging uncertainties, such as the high-\(p_{\mathrm{T}}\), the charm and light calibration, and the Run 1 to Run 2 extrapolation uncertainties, are expected to decrease significantly once Run 2 data based calibrations for track jet \(b\)-tagging have been completed [53].

In the case of the Higgs-jet tagging, two track jets are required to be \(b\)-tagged, and thus each large-\(R\) jet passing the selection is weighted by the corresponding calibration scale factor and corresponding systematic uncertainty from both track jets. Upon varying these weights, and taking into account correlations in the \(b\)-tagging calibration between track jets, the predicted number of large-\(R\) jets passing the selection will vary and thus an estimate of the uncertainty on the Higgs-jet efficiency and background rejection is attained, as shown in Figure 15.

### Higgs-jet taggers performance with systematic uncertainties

The Higgs-jet efficiency, and the multi-jet and hadronic top background rejections, versus \(p_{\rm T}\) can be found in Figure 15. For the Loose selection, the largest uncertainty on the Higgs-jet efficiency and background rejection is the \(b\)-tagging uncertainty, which is not surprising since the requirements on the large-\(R\) jet kinematics are not stringent. However, for the Medium and Tight selections, the \(b\)-tagging, jet scale, and jet resolution uncertainties are all similar in size. The Higgs-jet efficiency and rejections for the multi-jet and hadronic top background, both inclusive and broken down by jet flavor, are listed for the three tagger selections in Table 2. The uncertainties listed in Table 2 are the quadrature sum of the statistical and systematic uncertainties, and are typically systematic uncertainty dominated. The uncertainties on the Higgs-jet efficiency and background rejection tend to be larger for the tighter selections, though the increase is not enormous. Across selections, the relative uncertainty on the Higgs-jet efficiency is \(\sim 20\%\), while the relative uncertainty on the multi-jet rejection is \(\sim 20\%\) and the relative uncertainty on the hadronic top rejection is \(\sim 30\%\). For entries in Table 2 in which the number of jets passing the selection is nearly zero, an order of magnitude estimate of the rejection is computed from the central value of the rejection minus one standard deviation of the statistical uncertainty.

Table 2: Higgs-jet efficiencies, and rejections for the multi-jet and hadronic top backgrounds, are listed for the three tagger selections. The uncertainties listed are the quadrature sum of the statistical and systematic uncertainties, and are typically systematic uncertainty dominated. For cases when the number of jets passing the selection is nearly zero, an order of magnitude estimate of the rejection is computed from the central value of the rejection minus one standard deviation of the statistical uncertainty.

## 8 Conclusions

The identification of boosted Higgs bosons decaying to \(b\bar{b}\) with the ATLAS detector at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV has been presented. The candidate calorimeter jets are reconstructed with the anti-\(k_{t}\), \(R=1.0\) algorithm and trimmed with a subject radius of \(R_{\rm sub}=0.2\) and \(f_{\rm cut}=5\%\). The identification of \(b\)-hadrons is performed with track jets reconstructed with the anti-\(k_{t}\), \(R=0.2\) algorithm, and tagged with the ATLAS \(b\)-tagging algorithms. Several combinations of \(b\)-tagging, jet mass, and jet substructure requirements have been studied for jets in the \(p_{\rm T}\) range \(250-1500\) GeV. Three selections based on \(b\)-tagging at a 70% efficiency working point, mass window criteria, threshold on the energy correlation ratio, \(D_{2}^{(\beta=1)}\), are chosen to identify boosted Higgs-jets in early 2015 data based on their rejection of multi-jet and boosted hadronic top jet backgrounds. For the tight selection with a Higgs-jet efficiency of \(25\%\pm 5\%\), the most stringent selection has a multi-jet rejection of \(800\pm 210\) and a boosted hadronic top jet rejection of \(160\pm 50\). For the loose and medium selection, with inclusive Higgs-jet efficiency of \(41\%\pm 7\%\) and \(32\%\pm 6\%\), respectively, the multi-jet rejection obtained is \(260\pm 50\) and \(460\pm 90\), while the boosted hadronic top jet rejection corresponds to \(67\pm 17\) and \(110\pm 30\).
