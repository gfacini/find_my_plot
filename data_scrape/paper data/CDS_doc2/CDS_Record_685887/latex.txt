**Abstract**

In recent past, many different approaches towards a consistent tracker concept have extensively been discussed, all based on the ATLAS philosophy to track charged particles with a combination of 'continuous' and 'precision' tracking points. In all these evaluations, it was recognised that we should aim at a minimum amount of material between interaction point and cryostat and a constant ratio between precision and continuous track measurements as a function of rapidity, at affordable cost.

A too large amount of material, degrading electron and photon reconstruction, has been of major concern especially close to the interaction region and in the transition region between barrel and forward detectors. The occupancy as a function of radial position has motivated the choice to place the TR-straw-tracker at the largest radius possible.

So far however, discussions mainly concerned the barrel sector. In this paper, we present our strong personal preference for a modified Coseners House solution for the forward sector.

## 1 Introduction

The ATLAS inner tracker has four separate tasks to fulfill for all charged tracks within \(|\eta|<\) 2.5: vertexing, photon conversion identification, tracking and electron identification. Vertexing and photon conversion identification result in challenging requirements on the vertex detector, but do not appear as very different issues for a Panel-like or Coseners-like approach. We shall only discuss tracking and electron identification in this paper. Good tracking means unambiguous pattern recognition, accurate track measurement (precise direction, origin and curvature measurements) and the association of tracks with calorimeter clusters or muon tracks in the outer system.

For measurement of the momentum we need precision layers at different radii along a track, as the track bending in a perfect solenoidal field arises from the radial component of the momentum. The total deflection \(d\) of a high-momentum particle in a homogeneous magnetic field \(B\) after travelling a radial distance \(R\) is proportional to _BR_2[1]. For a precise measurement of track bending, we need the accurate determination of \(d\) and a large _BR_2; these two requirements resulted in the concept of 'hollow' MSGC wheels that measure spacepoints at the sagitta and the outermost point of the track inside the coil, while we assume that the (transverse) vertex position is known. The severe background from low-momentum tracks from minimum bias collisions results in a large collection of 'random' hits in both the precision layers and the straws. The most effective way to suppress this problem is to use tracking detectors with a high resolution and low occupancy (so that the probability that random hits form a good helix is low) and to use many of these detectors in a row so that more than two low-momentum tracks would be needed to fake a high-momentum track. The pattern recognition criterion set by the ATLAS collaboration after early simulations was, that one needs four precise space point measurements along a track to find true tracks. The vertex detector measurements are not included in this count, because of high track density in that region. This pattern recognition criterion has been tested with Monte Carlo simulations to be robust. Implicitly, one requires a good choice of the positions of each of the four space point measurements along the track.

Electrons must be efficiently recognised. The recognition of electrons is usually based on their shower profile in the electromagnetic calorimeter and the match between the measured energy and momentum. The preshower detector and the TRT enhance this identification power significantly for relatively isolated electrons.

## 2 Vector tracking

The Coseners House layout was based on the assumption that vector tracking would be the most efficient way to find tracks in high-luminosity background. In the vector tracking concept, layers of precision detectors are grouped, and local track stub ('vector') finding gives a first suppression of the spurious hits from the low-momentum tracks. The combination of two or more vectors into a track suppresses the remaining background, which comes predominantly from tracks with a momentum of order 1 GeV. The minimum arrangement needed for vector tracking is two sets of two precision detectors, such that two vectors are measured on a track. The 'four precision measurements' requirement originates from here. This pattern recognition algorithm is simple (which makes it useful in the second level trigger) and a tracker based on this concept is very robust against pileup if the precision layers have an adequate position resolution. Unfortunately there was no radial space in the barrel to pursue this concept strictly without a severe loss of TRT functionality. In the forward region, the Coseners House design clearly does follow the vector tracking concept. We think that this concept should be pursued where possible.

## 3 The proposed Annecy layout

At present, a consensus on the barrel ATLAS inner detector seems to be within reach, close to the Panel design. The Panel layout (figure 2) provides a solution to the following disadvantages of the Coseners House layout (figure 1):

* the TRT is interrupted by an SCT plane, which absorbs the generated TR;* a large area of semiconductor detectors is proposed, which is costly;
* the long barrel results in a high occupancy in the TRT straws;
* the Coseners House layout exceeds the material budget.

The forward region however, has not yet been re-evaluated in very great detail, although this sector contributes more to the physics acceptance than the barrel. The Panel proposed to extend the philosophy behind their newly designed barrel to the forward region. Many objections can be formulated against this approach, of which we will name a few. First of all, the forward region does not show the above mentioned problems associated with the barrel, so why come up with a solution to them. (We will return to the issue of material later on.) Secondly, the Panel's confidence in the TRT giving an \(r\phi\) point with an accuracy of 60 \(\mu\)m in the barrel is only justified by the low occupancy of the straws at the outer TRT radius. In the forward region however, the straws are radial. The occupancy is therefore _not_ low where we need the accurate space point to determine the track momentum.

We consider the material problem as the most serious drawback of the Coseners House layout. The excess of material is found between 1.2\(<\eta<\)1.8. In the first ATLAS milestones paper [4], figure 21 shows the contributions from the various subdetectors and passive layers to the total material. Up to 25% X\({}_{\oplus}\) in the problem region comes from the small TRT modules and the inner Semiconductor Tracker. From this we conclude that if we replace the Coseners House barrel with the Panel barrel, the material budget is not exceeded, even when the old forward region is maintained.

In fact, when we match this forward detector to the Panel layout barrel, we can get rid of some material of the forward detector. This match involves the following modifications to the Coseners forward detector:

* the innermost MSGC 'full' wheel is taken out;
* the optimisation of MSGC and TRT positions is redone, with a slightly altered algorithm as compared to the one used for the Coseners House layout [2], which results in less MSGC wheels. The algorithm is explained below.
* On the first two MSGC wheels, the outer rings are not needed because tracks passing through these rings have been adequately tracked by the barrel Semiconductor Tracker. Whether the first two inner MSGC rings are needed depends on the exact design of the inner layers of the SCT. The solution favoured by us is to remove also the first two small rings, such that the TRT has maximum space to solve the barrel/forward transition.

This arrangement is shown in figure 3, with the two small MSGC rings which may not be needed. The number of MSGC channels is slightly reduced as compared to the Coseners House layout, because a full wheel is effectively replaced by two small wheels. The gain in channels is 400,000 coming to a total of 4.2 million channels. (Removing the two small MSGCs will be cheaper on the MSGC side, but the adaptation of the SCT may cost more.)

The MSGC and TRT positions are computed as follows: we want to position MSGC wheels of 2.5 cm thickness (in Z) and TRT modules of 7 and 10.2 cm in Z. The positions of the MSGC wheels are derived from the requirement of 4 space points on each track in the region where only MSGCs do the precise outer tracking. In the Coseners House algorithm, we required two inner points and two outer points for all tracks coming from Z=+11.2 cm. Requiring four points over the full tracker, not restricting their positions, results in less MSGC wheels. The average number of precision layers crossed, averaged over the possible vertex positions, is 4.8 in the rapidity region 1.5\(<\eta<\)2.6. The average and minimum number of MSGC hits on a track are shown in figure 4. We intend to present this layout at the Annecy meeting in June 1994, so we give it the tentative name 'Annecy layout'. Although GaAs detectors are certainly needed in this arrangement, we have not drawn them because their positions will depend on the exact arrangement of the inner part of the barrel. The number of GaAs channels has been more than doubled from the Coseners House to the Panel layout to compensate partly for the loss in pattern recognition ability. With the proposed arrangement, this is not necessary, so that significant savings can be expected from that side.

The Annecy layout enjoys the powerful tracking concept of the Coseners Layout, while it contains less material in the barrel/forward transition region thanks to the adaptation of the Panel barrel, and the removal of the first full MSGC wheel. A comparison between the three layouts is given in table 1. The numbers for the detector thicknesses were kindly provided by C. Daum. Note that the proposed layout has more material than the Panel layout; the extra material (6-7% X\({}_{0}\)) is entirely due to the outermost MSGCs, so this extra material hardly adds to the tracking problems.

The cost aspects are discussed in the next section. The proposed layout has the following advantages over the forward detector presented by the Panel:

* The ATLAS inner detector should provide a stiff-track trigger at the second level. In the proposed layout, both the MSGC tracker and the TRT give information: the TRT will tag an isolated track, and the MSGCs will provide the momentum. In the Panel layout, one relies on the combination of position information in different subdetectors to derive the momentum of this track at the trigger level.
* The stand-alone momentum resolution of the MSGC tracker allows for robust pattern recognition at high luminosity, and an accurate momentum measurement is useful in

the E/p electron identification. It also improves the tracking and identification of non-isolated leptons.
* The better precision in \(\theta\left(\eta\right)\) measurement (following from a lever arm twice as long), and in the \(\eta\) extrapolation towards the calorimeter and the outer muon system, add to the relevance of the inner detector in physics analysis. Moreover the precise extrapolation of tracks in \(\theta\) towards the muon system is highly important for the right association of track segments, because \(\theta\) is the accurate coordinate in the outer system.
* The alignment of the TRT detector on tracks is simpler when radial position information is available on both sides of the TRT. The alignment of the MSGC wheels on tracks is much easier in the hollow wheel arrangement.
* A track with a kink (such as expected for electrons suffering from bremsstrahlung, but also decaying pions and kaons) may deviate predominantly in the radial direction. Such a track can only be identified when radial measurements are spread along the track, as is the case in the Annecy layout.

Figure 4: Average and minimum number of hits in the MSGCs. For the average, the vertex was smeared between \(\pm 2\sigma_{z}\); the number of hits at the least favourable vertex position (which depends on \(\eta\)) is shown in the lower curve.

* In the Panel layout, electron identification relies more than ever on the TRT, because not only the TR detection, but also the momentum measurement needed for an E/p match is performed by the TRT. This is contradictory to the 'robustness' targets.
* For high-luminosity running, it has been found reasonable to assume that the detector will eventually have to operate without the devices within 40 cm in radius. This implies that the tracking in the forward region should not rely on the performance of the GaAs disks, contrary to the statement in the 'criteria' document [5] that the GaAs detectors are foreseen to be rad hard. Clearly in case of GaAs breakdown the performance of the Panel's forward layout is very unsatisfactory.

## 4 Costing

The cost of the proposed detector can be estimated as follows. According to recent estimates the Panel layout and the Coseners House layout are very close in price, the Panel layout being a bit cheaper [6]. As compared to the Panel layout, there are 1.9 million MSGC channels more and very roughly 100,000 straws less. The GaAs detectors can be reduced to the Coseners House number of 700,000 channels. The net effect is approximately 2 million Chf gain with respect to the Panel layout, which makes the Annecy layout the cheapest of the three layouts!

When a further reduction of the cost of the forward detector is found necessary, we propose to evaluate the effect of the following changes:

* All MSGCs outside R = 60 cm have a 300 \(\mu\)m pitch instead of the earlier 200 \(\mu\)m (almost one million channels less, with a worse position and hence momentum resolution);
* The forward TRT does not measure a drift time.

The drift time electronics of the forward TRT could be subject to staging, so that the down-staged forward detector will have the same performance at low luminosity as the complete detector at high \(\mathcal{L}\).

## 5 Conclusions

The pros and cons expressed in this paper reflect the personal view of the authors. Nevertheless, many of the arguments and conclusions brought forward are supported by a large fraction of the MSGC community and others. It reflects the concern this community has to construct a robust forward tracker well capable of performing pattern recognition and track reconstruction under complicated conditions at (very) high luminosity. The Annecy layout presented in this paper combines the pattern recognition power and tracking accuracy of the Coseners House layout with the better material distribution of the Panel layout. We hope that it can serve as a basis for further optimisation.
