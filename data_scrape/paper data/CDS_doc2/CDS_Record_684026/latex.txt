**Abstract**

Tests have been done on the first full-scale BIL MDT chamber prototype "Calypso" to investigate the deformations produced both by loading the chamber and by varying the temperature of one multilayer with respect to the other. The chamber deflections were monitored by the RASNIK systems that served for the in-plane alignment and by dial gauges.

## 1. Introduction

The drift tube prototype chamber "Calypso" has been assembled in the University of Rome in June 1996, with a technique proposed by the Seattle Group, using tubes and end-plugs built by the Pavia Group \({}^{\rm[1]}\).

The chamber has been tested on the H8 test-beam at CERN in July '96 \({}^{\rm[2]}\). Then in September and October, tests on the mechanical behaviour under load and under temperature gradients have been done (Test-1 and test-2 refer to different experimental conditions). The mechanical effects were measured both by the RASNIK systems \({}^{\rm[3]}\) and by a set of dial gauges.

This note presents a short description of the mechanical structure of "Calypso" (a detailed presentation is given in Ref. 1) and the results of the mechanical and thermal tests.

The purpose of the study presented here is to understand any effect on MDT chambers due to both weight and temperature. As an example, we recall that a heat dissipation is expected from RPC chambers that, in the muon detection system, will be located very close to the MDT chambers.

## 2 "Calypso" mechanical structure

For the mechanical and thermal tests, the chamber was set in a horizontal plane, as shown in Fig. 1. Two stainless-steel cylindrical rods of 40 mm diameter were supporting "Calypso" by means of three mounts, two on the "high voltage" side and one on the "signal" side (see Fig. 2). Each rod was set on two concrete blocks, 1.8 m apart, by means of two plates with 3 screws allowing for a planar position of the plate itself. As the support rods were mounted far outboard, they allowed for a rather large deflection. Hence in considering the flexibility of the chamber, the rods' deflection must be taken into account.

We call Calypso-1 (Calypso-2) the first (second) multilayer exposed to the H8 beam. During the mechanical and thermal tests the chamber was upside-down, i.e. Calypso-1 (Calypso-2) was below (above).

### 2.1 Mechanical monitoring of the chamber

A double monitoring system has been used. The main system was based on RASNIK-CCD systems [3]. The RASNIK devices are mounted directly on the mechanical structure of "Calypso" (see Fig. 2). Hence, it is independent of the support rods' deflection mentioned before.

The second system was made of five or three dial gauges which were located under the chamber, first along one long side and then along the opposite long side (see Fig. 1). The dial gauges precision is \(\pm\) 5 \(\upmu\)m. (Only three dial gauges were used during part of the September tests and during the October temperature gradient tests.)

### 2.2 Thermal monitoring of the chamber

The temperature monitoring system was based on 48 thermal probes [4]: 24 for each of the two multilayers. In a multilayer, the probes were located into two horizontal planes 26 mm apart. The probes were inserted between the tubes. The electrical signal was read out and converted to a temperature through a dedicated Macintosh.

As a further control, a mercury thermometer was used, which had a precision of 0.5 \({}^{\circ}\)C.

## 3 Mechanical tests

The tests performed consisted in loading "Calypso" with different weights in its centre and in measuring the deflection both with the RASNIK and with the five or three dial gauges (see Fig. 1, 2 and 3).

However, the RASNIK systems measure the deformation of the chamber itself, while the set of dial gauges measures the deflection of the whole system "chamber + support rods". Therefore the contribution of the rods to the total deflection measured by the dial gauges must be subtracted. This has been done by subtracting the average displacement measured by the two end dial gauges.

Moreover, to investigate for a reduction of the chamber deformation, a test was done by stretching two steel rods across the two cross-plates (see Fig. 3).

### Flexibility test

One (\(5\times 10\times 20\)) cm\({}^{3}\) lead block has been put in the chamber centre interposing a wood plate to distribute the load (ca. 12 kg total weight) along the whole chamber width (1 m). In a further measurement, two blocks were used (ca. 24 kg).

Fig. 4 shows the "absolute" deflection measured by the dial gauges with a 12 kg load (upper part). Subtracting the deviation measured by the two end dial gauges, the "relative" deviation is obtained, which gives the "true" chamber deflection (Fig. 4 lower part).

Fig. 5 shows the deflections for 12 and 24 kg. The results obtained with the RASNIK is in good agreement with the one obtained with the dial gauges (see Table 1). The finite element analysis (FEA) prediction for a 24 kg load is -108 \(\upmu\)m.

When the load is taken away, the deformation disappeared.

### Flexibility test with stretching rods

The 12 kg load test was repeated when a torque was applied to 2 additional rods of 4 mm diameter in such a way as to compensate for the deflection. This operation was done "by hand" and no torque wrench has been used to monitor the torque value.

As shown in Fig. 6, a deflection of the chamber of 80 \(\upmu\)m can be easily recovered by means of steel rods stretched with a convenient torque.

This method could be improved: (i) the torque could be monitored by means of a torque wrench; (ii) the maximum torque could be increased (moreover controlled better) by using rods with a larger diameter. Nevertheless, as the two cross-plates have a thickness of 5 mm that reduces to 1 mm in a special thin zone, a high torque may only deflect the cross-plates without compensating the deflection of the chamber.

## 4 Thermal tests

The main thermal test consisted in heating only one multilayer, to produce a temperature gradient between the two multilayers, and in measuring the deflection both with the RASNIK and with three dial gauges.

The chamber heating was done by covering Calypso-2 with four electric blankets. These are commercial blankets that dissipate a maximum power of 55 W each; a 10 steps' potentiometer allowed for heating regulation. The full coverage area of the blankets (\(1.5\times 3.2\) m\({}^{2}\)) is larger than the Calypso-2 surface (ca. \(1\times 2.6\) m\({}^{2}\)). Calypso-1 was kept at room temperature (i.e. at 20 to 22 \({}^{\circ}\)C).

To diminish the heating time of Calypso-2 and to reach a thermal equilibrium in a reasonable time (typically about 2 hours), the blankets were covered by a black cloth and a layer of thermal insulator (plastic foam ca. 10 cm thick).

To stabilise the Calypso-2 temperature (typically from 29 to 32 \({}^{\circ}\)C), the blanket potentiometers were switched to step 6. In such a condition, the total dissipated power was ca. 130 W for the four blankets.

Under these conditions, the chamber heating resulted in a thermal difference between Calypso-2 and Calypso-1.

### Test-1

In this test, the temperature probes were not operating. Thus the temperature was measured by a mercury thermometer that was placed on the drift tubes in three different positions: above Calypso-2, below Calypso-2 (the thermometer was fixed with scotch) and above Calypso-1.

The test-1 was done with Calypso-1 at 22 \({}^{\circ}\)C and Calypso-2 at 29/27 \({}^{\circ}\)C (above/below Calypso-2 respectively). Hence, the temperature gradient was ranging from 5 to 7 \({}^{\circ}\)C (see Fig. 7 solid lines). The deflection is about 100 \(\upmu\)m with a good agreement between the RASNIK and the dial gauges (see Table 2). In Fig. 7 upper part, the dotted line corresponds to the chamber sag after we have turned the heating off and waited until the temperature gradient was lowered to 1 to 2 \({}^{\circ}\)C.

### Test-2

An eventual thermal effect due to chamber self-heating when all the read-out and HV cards are switched on has been investigated. As shown in Fig. 8, no deformation is found.

Fig. 9 and 10 show the measured temperature for the two planes of probes in Calypso-1 (which is at room temperature) and in Calypso-2 before and after two hours of heating.

The heat transmission from one multilayer to the other was negligible for the purposes of our tests, as can be seen by comparing Calypso-1 temperature map in Fig. 9 and 10. This is due to the low conductivity of heat through the thin layer of glue between tubes and cross-plates.

The upper part of Fig. 11 shows the deflection as a function of 4 gradient values, and the lower part shows the same deformation represented as a function of the temperature of Calypso-2. The line represented on the lower part of Fig. 11 is a fit made on the 5 points. The relation between deformation and temperature is linear and is of 18 \(\upmu\)m per \({}^{\circ}\)C. Note that the deformation is perfectly recovered when Calypso-2 temperature comes back to room temperature.

The test-2 results give us a full confirmation of the conclusions of test-1.

In a further test, the Calypso-2/Calypso-1 gradient was combined with a gradient along Calypso-2 tubes. Namely, the heating of Calypso-2 was done by turning on only the two blankets that were on the signal side of the multilayer. The results shown in Fig. 12 after three different periods of time indicate that a deflection of about 100 \(\upmu\)m is reached once the chamber has stabilised, after ca. 6 hours. Figs 13, 14 and 15 show the temperature maps after 2, 4, and 6 hours of heating.

For all the measurements discussed above, a good agreement between the RASNIK and the dial gauges has been found (see Table 2).

Conclusions

A summary of the results is given in Tables 1 and 2. The agreement between the RASNIK systems and the dial gauges in measuring the chamber deformation is very good. The difference is contained within the dial gauges precision of \(\pm 5\)\(\upmu\)m.

The mechanical tests have shown that the deformation of our BIL MDT chamber prototype, both under loads and temperature gradients, turns out to be always elastic.

The deflection produced by a load of 24 kg in the central area of the chamber is of the order of 150 \(\upmu\)m. A partial compensation of this deflection (ca. 80 \(\upmu\)m) may be achieved by stretching rods.

A temperature difference between the two multilayers of about 10 \({}^{\circ}\)C produces a deflection of the order of 180 \(\upmu\)m. A temperature gradient that combines a difference of temperature between the multilayers and along the tubes produces a deflection similar to the previous one. The chamber heating due to the electronic cards is negligible.
