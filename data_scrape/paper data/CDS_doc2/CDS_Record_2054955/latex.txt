## 1 Introduction

The New Small Wheel (NSW) [1] of the ATLAS detector at CERN will be installed in 2019 during the long-shut-down (LS2) of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). Low voltage power will be provided at 1.5V to all the Front End Boards (FEB) on the NSW detectors by CERN MicroElectronics' DCDC converter - FEAST [2]. The converters will be integrated onto the FEBs themselves and will operate in a harsh environment with high radiation levels and high magnetic fields. Table 1 provides the radiation levels that were used in the design of this study. To provide better voltage regulation after the FEAST circuits, we investigate the possibility of the use of Texas Instrument's (TI) TPS7H1101-SP [3], an ultra low drop-out voltage regulator. This device operates under a wide range of input voltages - 1.5 to 7V - and under a load of at most 3A.

Radiation damage to semiconductor technology is characterized by three broad categories of radiation effects: Total Ionizing Dose (TID), Single Event Effects (SEE) and displacement damage. The exposure to ionizing radiation, known as TID, degrades the performance of the device due to the creation and trapping of electron-hole pairs in the dielectric and silicon interface regions. SEEs are

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{l l l} \hline \hline  & Inner Rim1  & Outer Rim2  \\ \hline TID & 1740 Gy & 84 Gy \\ NIEL & \(2.1\times 10^{14}\,\mathrm{n/cm^{2}}\) & \(7.1\times 10^{12}\,\mathrm{n/cm^{2}}\) \\ SEE & \(4.3\times 10^{13}\,\mathrm{p/cm^{2}}\) & \(1.4\times 10^{12}\,\mathrm{p/cm^{2}}\) \\ \_B_ field & \(\leq\)1 kGauss & 5 kGauss \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}

caused by exposure to single and energetic particles that can cause non-destructive or destructive effects. Some non-destructive effects include transient pulses and bit-flips. Destructive SEEs would include burnout and gate ruptures. Lastly, displacement damage is caused by exposure to heavy, energetic particles like neutrons which can destroy lattice structures by displacing silicon atoms. The TPS7H1101-SP has been radiation qualified for TID and SEE effects by Texas Instruments [4], however displacement damage effects have not been studied yet. For the application of the TPS7H1101-SP on the FEBs of the NSW, we study its susceptibility to displacement damage and present its performance in fast neutrons.

## 2 Fast Neutron Exposure

Even though CMOS technology is more resistant to displacement damage as compared to bipolar technology, operating in the extremely harsh radiation environment of the NSW could be challenging. Since the TPS7H1101-SP regulator has a PMOS pass element, several of them were exposed to neutrons at the Fast Neutron Irradiation (FNI) facility at the University of Massachusetts Lowell [5]. The 1 MeV neutron equivalent (1 MeVNE) fast neutrons at the facility were produced from a 1 MegaWatt research reactor with a flux of \(1\times 10^{11}\,\mathrm{n/cm^{2}}-\sec\).

For the NSW, the maximum expected dose from neutrons is \(2.1\times 10^{14}\,1\mathrm{MeVNE/cm^{2}}\), as given in table 1, therefore to study the effects of displacement damage, a total of eight regulators were exposed to four different doses from \(1.5\times 10^{14}\,1\mathrm{MeVNE/cm^{2}}\) to \(6\times 10^{14}\,1\mathrm{MeVNE/cm^{2}}\). The unobserved regulators were lowered, in a water tight box, into the reactor pool next to the core.

Two regulators were left unexposed to be the control samples. Table 2 summarizes the neutron doses received by the regulators.

## 3 Pre and Post Exposure Testing

A full suite of tests were performed on the two unexposed and eight exposed regulators to study the effects of displacement damage. The tests consisted of measuring the load regulation, line regulation, drop-out voltage and ripple rejection. They were performed on a custom test board designed by Michigan as shown in Figure 1. The test board contains SMA connectors for voltage and noise measurements. Other test points, pin headers, are provided to measure and monitor current, feedback voltage, etc. After the regulator, the board provides an optional output pi filter which can be used to study the effects of heavier filtering on the output.

Unless otherwise noted, all the regulators were supplied with an input voltage of 1.5V from the BK Precision 100W DC power supply and the test boards were configured to produce an output voltage of 1.2V. The load on the output was varied with the use of the BK Precision 150W DC electronic load. Voltage and noise measurements were made using a 1G-samples/second oscilloscope

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{c c} \hline Part Code & Total Dose \(1\,\mathrm{MeVNE/cm^{2}}\) \\ \hline U1, U2 & 0 \\ A1, A2 & 1.5 x \(10^{14}\) \\ B1, B2 & 3.0 x \(10^{14}\) \\ C1, C2 & 4.5 x \(10^{14}\) \\ D1, D2 & 6.0 x \(10^{14}\) \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}

and multimeters via coaxial cables. The regulators were also cooled with a heat sink and an external fan. Figure 2 shows the test setup in the lab.

### Load Regulation

The ability of a circuit to maintain a specified output voltage under varying load condition is known as load regulation. It was measured for the ten regulators by recording the output voltage on varying the output current from 0A to 3A. Figure 3(a) shows the regulation at 1.2V in as a function of neutron dose for three different output currents - 1A, 2A and 3A. Each point on the figure represents a regulator. Since two regulators were exposed to each neutron dose, the solid and dotted lines represent one at each dose, i.e. solid lines represent regulators U1, A1, B1, C1 and D1; dotted lines represent regulators U2, A2, B2, C2 and D2 1.

Interestingly, the ability of the regulator to maintain a constant output voltage, as a function of output current, improves from regulators U1, U2 to D1, D2. This can be seen in figure 3(b) where the drop in the output voltage is shown as a function of output current for the 10 regulators. For an output current of 3A, the un-dosed regulators, U1 and U2, have a voltage drop of 16mV, whereas the highest dosed regulators, D1 and D2, have a 3-4mV drop in voltage.

Figure 4(a) shows the regulation for an input voltage of 5V as a function of neutron dose for three different output currents - 1A, 2A and 3A. For an output current of 1A, the output voltage falls linearly as the dose increases, however for higher currents, the drop in output voltage is no longer linear as a function of the dose. Figure 4(b) shows the drop in the output voltage as a function of output current for the 10 regulators. The regulator-to-regulator differences in the output voltage drop can be seen more explicitly for the higher dosed devices, i.e. differences between (B1, B2), (C1, C2) and (D1, D2). For the large output load of 3A, the higher dosed devices C1 and D1 trigger the over-temperature mode and this can be seen in both figures 4(a) and 4(b) by the lack of data points.

### Line Regulation

The ability of a circuit to maintain a specified output voltage under varying input voltages is known as line regulation. It was measured by recording the output voltage as a function of the input voltage (from 1.5V to 6V) for the exposed and unexposed regulators. Figure 5 shows the line regulation for the ten regulators for three different output/input currents, i.e. 1A, 2A and 3A.

The increase in output voltage as a function of input voltage as the neutron doses increases (from regulators (U1, U2) to (D1, D2))2 is evident from figures 5(a), 5(b) and 5(c). Also evident from the plots is the larger increase in output voltage with larger loads, i.e. 1A vs 3A. With the combination of being exposed to neutron radiation and operating at the largest load of 3A, regulators A1 and A2 trigger the over-temperature mode at V\({}_{in}\) = 5.5V, regulators B1 and B2 at V\({}_{in}\) = 5V, regulators C1 and C2 at V\({}_{in}\) = 4.5V and 5.5V respectively and regulators D1 and D2 at V\({}_{in}\) = 5V and 4.5V respectively.

Footnote 2: U1, U2: un-dosed; A1, A2: \(1.5\times 10^{14}\) 1MeVNE/cm\({}^{2}\); B1, B2: \(3\times 10^{14}\) 1MeVNE/cm\({}^{2}\); C1, C2: \(4.5\times 10^{14}\) 1MeVNE/cm\({}^{2}\); D1, D2: \(6\times 10^{14}\) 1MeVNE/cm\({}^{2}\)

### Drop-out Voltage

The input-to-output differential voltage at which a voltage regulator stops to regulate against further reductions in input voltage is known as the drop-out voltage. It was measured as a function of output current for the ten regulators by opening the regulator's pass element to the fullest by setting the output voltage to be larger than the input voltage. Figure 6(a) shows the drop-out voltage for the regulators as a function of neutron dose for three different output currents - 1A, 2A and 3A. As seen in the figure, the drop-out voltage increases as the dose increases. The increase is larger for the devices drawing more current.

Figure 6(b) shows the drop-out voltage as a function of output current for the ten regulators. The increase in drop-out voltage with the increase in current is also seen here. A point to note: during drop-out testing, regulators D1 and D2 would shut down after tripping the over temperature protection when drawing 3A of current.

### Ripple Rejection

Ripple rejection, also know as power supply ripple rejection (PSRR), is the ability of the circuit to reject the AC component coming from the input power supply at various frequencies. For the regulators, it was obtained by measuring the suppression of an injected signal. A sine-wave with a peak-to-peak amplitude of 1V was injected to the test board along with the input voltage. The ripple rejection was calculated by measuring the amplitude of the signal at the input and output of the test board by performing Fast Fourier Transforms (FFTs). This was done at three different frequencies: 100kHz, 500kHz and 1MHz. Figure 7 shows the ripple rejection for the different frequencies. Figure 8 shows the waveforms for the input and output voltages as well as their FFTs.

## 4 Summary

The tolerance of TI's TPS7H1101-SP to displacement damage by fast neutrons was studied by measuring the load regulation, line regulation, drop-out voltage and ripple rejection before and after exposure to four different neutron doses from \(1.5\times 10^{14}\,1\)MeVNE/cm\({}^{2}\) to \(6\times 10^{14}\,1\)MeVNE/cm\({}^{2}\). The results presented in this document show that TI's TPS7H1101-SP can be used as voltage regulators (taking an input voltage of 1.5V and delivering 1.2V) after the FEAST DCDC converters on the FEBs of the NSW which are expected to receive a maximum neutron dose of \(2.1\times 10^{14}\,1\)MeVNE/cm\({}^{2}\).
