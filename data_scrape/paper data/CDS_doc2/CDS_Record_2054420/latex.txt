**Impact of fragmentation modelling on the jet energy and the top-quark mass measurement using the ATLAS detector**

The ATLAS Collaboration

The effect of the fragmentation modelling on the calibration of jets and the precise measurement of the top quark mass in proton-proton collisions at \(\sqrt{s}=7\) TeV with the ATLAS experiment is investigated. The studies demonstrate that the effects of changing the models for parton shower, hadronisation and underlying event can extend beyond changes that are accounted for in the jet energy calibration.

## 1 Introduction

The mass of the top quark (\(m_{\rm top}\)) is an important free parameter in the Standard Model (SM) that can be measured in proton-anti-proton collisions at the Tevatron or proton-proton collisions at the LHC. The standard technique relies on the direct reconstruction of the top quark decay products to determine the top quark mass. A Monte Carlo (MC) simulation of events where top quarks are produced is used for the calibration of the top quark mass measurement.

Top mass measurements have been carried out by the Tevatron and the LHC experiments over the past two decades. The latest most precise measurements [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] reach a precision of about 0.4% to 0.5%. Also combinations of the individual measurements have been performed [6, 7, 8]. Given the impressive precision which is being reached by the experiments, understanding the differences between analyses, cross-checking the \(m_{\rm top}\) measurement techniques employed and reviewing the MC modelling uncertainties is important.

Typically, the measurements are dominated by systematic uncertainties. The modelling of the final state in events with top quarks by the MC simulations is one of the dominant systematic uncertainty sources. In the present top quark mass measurements different approaches to evaluate the systematic uncertainties are adopted. The systematic uncertainty due to the modelling of the parton shower and the hadronisation is treated differently. A discussion of this point can be found in Ref. [8].

In particular, the systematic uncertainty due to the modelling of parton showering and hadronisation can be large. This uncertainty can be estimated using events generated with one generator for the hard scattering process and two different generators simulating the parton showering and the hadronisation. A comparison of the Pythia[9] and the Herwig[10] Monte Carlo event generators can be used. Since this uncertainty is estimated by comparing only two different MC simulations, a rigorous statistical interpretation is difficult and it should be treated in a conservative way. However, the parton showering and hadronisation modelling also changes the calibration of the jet energies and this difference is also considered when deriving the uncertainties on the jet energy measurements. Hence, there is a potentialdouble counting between the parton shower and hadronisation uncertainty and the jet energy uncertainty which is not desirable for precision measurements.

Using the example of the recent precise measurement of the top quark mass by the ATLAS collaboration performed in proton-proton collisions at \(\sqrt{s}=7\) TeV at LHC in the \(l\)+jets channel [2], this study investigates to what extent the variation of the jet energies in event samples simulated with two different models for the parton shower and the hadronisation process changes the value of the top quark mass measurements. Jets are re-calibrated such that the mean calorimeter response to jets in bins of transverse momenta and pseudo-rapidity is the same for both samples. In this way the effect of parton shower and hadronisation modelling on the overall event final state topology in top quark pair (\(t\bar{t}\)) events can be studied.

To support the conclusion of this study, the influence of the parton shower and hadronisation process on the top quark and \(W\) boson mass reconstructed using a simple kinematic top pair reconstruction method starting from the stable particles is also investigated with the help of various Monte Carlo generators.

The outline of the note is as follows. First, recent top quark mass measurements by ATLAS are reviewed in Section 2. The Monte Carlo simulation models are described in Section 3. A study of the influence of the parton shower and hadronisation modelling on the reconstructed \(W\) boson and top quark mass is presented in Section 4. For this study the physics objects are reconstructed from the stable particles using various recent Monte Carlo generators. Section 5 gives an overview of the jet calibration and the associated jet energy measurement uncertainties in the ATLAS experiment. The derivation of a dedicated jet calibration using Pythia or Herwig is explained. The most precise method to measure the top quark mass used by ATLAS is outlined in Section 6. Finally the dependence of the top quark mass on the parton shower and hadronisation modelling obtained with these two different jet calibrations is discussed in Section 7.

The table shows the relative total (\(\Delta m^{\text{tot}}_{\text{top}}\)) and the statistical (\(\Delta m^{\text{stat}}_{\text{top}}\)) uncertainty as well as the systematic component related to the parton showering and hadronisation modelling (\(\Delta m^{\text{had}}_{\text{top}}\)). The uncertainty on the value of \(\Delta m^{\text{had}}_{\text{top}}\) due to limited MC statistics is at most 0.06% and 0.12% for the two-dimensional and three-dimensional analyses, respectively. The corresponding uncertainty on the expected statistical uncertainty \(\Delta m^{\text{stat}}_{\text{top}}\), in the two-dimensional and three-dimensional analyses is respectively about 0.04% and 0.09%.

## 2 Recent ATLAS top quark mass measurements

Recently, the ATLAS collaboration published a measurement based on \(t\bar{t}\) pair events in the fully hadronic channel produced in proton-proton collisions at \(\sqrt{s}=7\) TeV with a precision of 1.05% [11]. A first preliminary measurement in the \(\sqrt{s}=8\) TeV data-set is available for event topologies where a single top quark is produced via the electro-weak interaction [12]. In March 2015, ATLAS published a new top quark mass measurement based on proton-proton collision data collected at \(\sqrt{s}=7\) TeV [2]. The \(l\)+jets and di-lepton decay modes are first measured separately and then combined. The final result has a precision of 0.53%.

In all measurements the systematic uncertainties due to the modelling of the final state give a relatively large contribution to the total systematic uncertainty. These include uncertainties related to the amount of additional parton radiation (ISR/FSR) and the modelling of the parton shower and hadronisation process. In particular, the parton showering and hadronisation uncertainties estimated from a comparison of the Pythia[9] and Herwig[10] Monte Carlo event generators applied to the same event sample based on Powheg for the hard scattering process \(pp\to t\bar{t}\) can be large.

To reduce the \(t\bar{t}\) pair modelling uncertainties, and the uncertainty related to the measurement of the \(b\)-jet energy, ATLAS developed a new technique to measure the top quark mass (see Section 6). This technique allows the uncertainty on the measured top quark mass to be significantly reduced, but also increases the statistical uncertainty and the sensitivity to some experimental effects. The size of the parton showering and hadronisation uncertainties in recent ATLAS analyses are summarised in Table 1. To illustrate how the top quark mass fit techniques can change the relative size of the systematic uncertainty components, the preliminary results1 of the ATLAS \(l\)+jets measurement technique are included [13]. The numbers shown in Table 1 have significant statistical uncertainties due to the limited size of the Monte Carlo samples used to evaluate them. The typical size of this uncertainty on the evaluation of the expected statistical uncertainty of the measurement \(\Delta m_{\text{top}}^{\text{stat}}\) in the \(l\)+jets two-dimensional and three-dimensional analyses are about 0.04% and 0.09%, respectively. The evaluation of \(\Delta m_{\text{top}}^{\text{had}}\) uses samples with correlated events; upper limits on the statistical uncertainties related to its values are therefore obtained assuming uncorrelated samples, giving respectively about 0.06% and 0.12% for the two-dimensional and three-dimensional analyses.

Footnote 1: The final result based on the three-dimensional analysis of Ref. [13] is superseded by Ref. [2], but the result using the two-dimensional analysis is only quoted in Ref. [13].

## 3 Monte Carlo samples

A Powheg\(t\bar{t}\) sample was generated using the version Powheg-hvq p4 [14], with the CT10NLO PDF [15] and their factorisation and renormalisation scales set to \(Q^{2}=m_{t}^{2}+p_{\text{T}}^{2}\), where \(m_{\text{top}}\) is the top quark mass and \(p_{\text{T}}\) the top quark transverse momentum as evaluated for the underlying Born configuration (i.e. before radiation). The Powheg MC generator is based on a NLO QCD matrix element calculation and was interfaced to Pythia[9], using the "C" variant of the Perugia 2011 tunes [16] and the corresponding CTEQ6L1 PDF [17]. This sample is referred to as Powheg+Pythia. The MC event generator Pythia uses \(p_{\text{T}}\)-ordered parton showers to model additional radiation in the leading-logarithmic approximation [18]. Multiple parton interactions [19] as well as fragmentation and hadronisation based on the Lund string model [20] are included.

An additional Powheg sample was generated to compare the parton shower and hadronisation models. It was interfaced to Herwig[10] together with Jimmy[21] for the multiple-parton interaction model using the AUET2 tune [22] (Powheg\(+\)Herwig). The Herwig Monte Carlo event generator uses angular-ordered parton showers [23]. The cluster model is used for the hadronisation [24].

Both samples use the same hard scattering events as generated with Powheg and only the models for parton showers, hadronisation and the underlying event are different.

In order compare to newer Monte Carlo generators for the parton shower and hadronisation a Powheg Monte Carlo sample is generated using Pythia8[25] (version 8.186) or Herwig++ (version 2.7.1) [26]. For these two samples the same Powheg settings are used, except that the parameter controlling the matching of the matrix element to the parton shower (\(h_{\mathrm{damp}}\)) was set to the top quark mass, as recommended in Ref. [27, 28]. The Pythia8 generator uses the ATLAS A14 tune for the hadronisation and underlying modelling [29]. For Herwig++ the UEEE-5 tune is used that is based on the models discussed in Ref. [30, 31].

All Monte Carlo simulation samples use a top mass of \(m_{\mathrm{top}}=172.5\) GeV.

To properly simulate the LHC environment for all Monte Carlo event samples, additional inelastic \(pp\) interactions were generated with Pythia using the AMBT1 tune [32] and then overlaid on the hard processes. The MC events are weighted such that the distribution of generated mean number of \(pp\) collisions matched that of the data-taking period. The particles from additional interactions are added before the signal digitisation and reconstruction steps of the detector simulation.

## 4 Study of mass distributions at particle level

To study the effect of the parton showering, hadronisation and underlying event on the reconstructed \(W\) boson and top quark mass, the kinematic properties of the top pair events are reconstructed by a simple top pair reconstruction algorithm. This algorithm first combines the stable particles to leptons, jets and missing transverse momentum and in a second step to objects that are closely related to the \(W\) boson and the top quark from the underlying hard scattering. The pseudo-top reconstruction algorithm explained in detail in Ref. [33] is used. Events are selected as detailed in Ref. [33]. The study is based on the Rivet [34] framework.

Fig. 1 shows the distributions of the reconstructed top quark and the \(W\)-boson mass on the level of the stable particles combined with the pseudo-top reconstruction algorithm. The top quark and the W boson mass distribution from the hadronically decaying \(W\) boson are shown.

For the top quark mass distribution the Powheg\(+\)Herwig prediction has fewer events in the peak region than the Powheg\(+\)Pythia prediction. The Powheg\(+\)Pythia distribution has fewer events at lower top quark mass values and has more events at larger values than Powheg\(+\)Herwig. The distributions for Powheg\(+\)Pythia and Powheg\(+\)Pythia8 are similar. However, the distribution for Powheg\(+\)Herwig\(++\) has more events at lower top quark mass values than the other Monte Carlo generators. In particular, the distribution of Powheg\(+\)Herwig\(++\) is significantly different from the Powheg\(+\)Herwig distribution.

For the \(W\) boson mass distribution the distribution based on Powheg\(+\)Pythia has more events at lower \(W\) mass values than Powheg\(+\)Herwig. The Powheg\(+\)Pythia distribution is slightly shifted with respect to Powheg\(+\)Herwig towards lower values. The distributions for Powheg\(+\)Pythia and Powheg\(+\)Pythia8 are similar. Powheg\(+\)Herwig\(++\) has many more events at low values than the other Monte Carlo generators.

In conclusion, significant differences between the different parton shower and hadronisation models on the reconstructed top quark mass and \(W\) boson distribution are already seen at the particle level, i.e. without any detector simulation.

## 5 Jet calibration and uncertainties

The jet calibration and the derivation of the uncertainties in the jet energy measurement is outlined in detail in Refs. [35; 36].

The jet energy as measured in the calorimeter is corrected such that the calibrated jet energy matches, on average, the one from the corresponding jet built from the stable particles (with a lifetime defined by \(c\tau>10\) mm) entering the ATLAS detector. To do this an inclusive jet event sample simulated with Pythia is used. The calibration is derived as a function of the jet energy and pseudo-rapidity. Differences between the calorimeter response to jets in data and MC are evaluated using events where a well measured physics object like a photon or a \(Z\) boson balances a jet in transverse momentum. The uncertainties on the jet energy measurement are thus related to physics effects that can alter the transverse momentum balance or are related to the measurement of the photon or \(Z\) boson used as reference object.

The uncertainty of the energy measurement of \(b\)-jets is difficult to assess to the required precision with standard methods probing the data. By comparing jets formed from the energy depositions in the calor

The figures show the predictions of the Powheg Monte Carlo generator using Pythia, Pythia8, Herwig and Herwig++. The lower part of the figure shows the ratio of the Pythia, Pythia8 or Herwig++ and the Herwig predictions.

imeter with the ones formed from tracks in data and Monte Carlo simulations [37] a precision between about 2% and 4% can be obtained. A better precision can be achieved by comparing the jet response in MC with different fragmentation models for \(b\)-jets in inclusive jet events. Various modelling uncertainties are considered: the \(b\)-hadron fragmentation function, the effect of the Pythia tune and a comparison of Pythia and Herwig. The estimated uncertainty is about 1% for jet transverse momenta (\(p_{\mathrm{T}}\)) above 30 GeV.

The uncertainties on the jet energy measurement cover the response of the detector to particle level jets, but do not contain model uncertainties on the transformation of partons to particle level jets.

In this study, parton showering and hadronisation effects on the calorimeter response to jets built from stable particles (truth level) are evaluated by re-calibrating the jets as explained below. The calorimeter response to stable particle level jets is defined as the ratio of the reconstructed to the generated jet transverse momentum:

\[\mathcal{R}^{\mathrm{particle}} = \frac{p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{reco}}}{p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{ particle}}}.\]

It is derived as a function of the generated jet \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) in the \(t\bar{t}\) Powheg+Pythia and the Powheg+Herwig event samples in bins of jet pseudo-rapidity \(\eta\).

To study the potential effects on the calorimeter response arising between the parton level and the particle level, it is useful to define the parton level response, \(\mathcal{R}^{\mathrm{parton}}\):

\[\mathcal{R}^{\mathrm{parton}} = \frac{p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{reco}}}{p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{ parton}}}.\]

Jets are defined by the anti-k\({}_{t}\) algorithm [38] with a distance parameter \(R=0.4\). Only events with one isolated lepton in the final state are used. These responses are derived inclusively and separately for each flavour of the hard parton initiating the jets. Light-quarks, \(b\)-quarks and \(c\)-quarks, all before radiation, are considered. To determine the jet flavour, the generated jets are matched to the highest energy parton within \(\Delta R=\sqrt{\Delta\eta^{2}+\Delta\phi^{2}}=0.4\) as explained in Ref. [35].

For a jet to be considered in this study, it must have \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\leavevmode\nobreak\ >15\) GeV at particle level and \(|\eta|<2.5\). In addition, at reconstruction level, at least 75% of its summed track \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) must be due to tracks coming from the primary vertex to avoid selecting jets from additional proton-proton interactions (pile-up). Since electron clusters are usually reconstructed as jets, the closest jet lying within \(\Delta R=0.2\) of any selected electron is removed to avoid electrons entering the jet response spectra. The selection of electron candidates follows the criteria detailed in Ref. [2], however using relaxed requirements on the track quality and looser isolation criteria, similar to Ref. [39]. In addition, electron candidates are required to have a transverse energy \(E_{\mathrm{T}}\) larger than 20 GeV.

The jet re-calibration factors, \(\mathcal{C}\), are calculated as the ratio of the calorimeter response in the Powheg+Herwig sample, \(\mathcal{R}^{\mathrm{particle}}_{\mathrm{Herwig}}\), divided by the response in the Powheg+Pythia sample, \(\mathcal{R}^{\mathrm{particle}}_{\mathrm{Pythia}}\):

\[\mathcal{C} = \frac{\mathcal{R}^{\mathrm{particle}}_{\mathrm{Herwig}}}{\mathcal{R }^{\mathrm{particle}}_{\mathrm{Pythia}}}.\]

For the studies presented in the following sections, the jet recalibration factors are applied to jets in the Powheg+Pythia sample as a function of \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) and \(\eta\) to modify the sample such that it has the same per-jet energy response as the Powheg+Herwig MC sample. Comparison between the re-calibrated Powheg+Pythia and Powheg+Herwig MC samples are used to study the impact of changing the parton shower and hadronisation model without including the jet energy response difference that is part of the jet energy uncertainties.

Figure 2 shows the ratio of the jet response, i.e. calorimeter response with respect to partons or with respect to jets built from stable particles obtained in the \(t\bar{t}\) Powheg+Pythia MC sample and in the \(t\bar{t}\) Powheg+Herwig MC sample for inclusive jets. The effect for each flavour separately can be seen in Figure 3.

The response difference of jets in the Powheg+Pythia and Powheg+Herwig MC sample, \(\mathcal{R}^{\text{particle}}_{\text{Pythia}}-\mathcal{R}^{\text{particle}}_{ \text{Herwig}}\) is about 1% for inclusive jets and for light-quark initiated jets and up to 2% at low jet \(p_{\text{T}}\) for \(c\)-jets and \(b\)-jets. When the re-calibration factors are applied, i.e. the jets in the Powheg+Pythia samples are calibrated as the jets in the Powheg+Herwig sample, there is no response difference between the Powheg+Pythia and Powheg+Herwig MC samples within an accuracy of about 0.1%.

The partonic response difference of jets in the Powheg+Pythia and Powheg+Herwig MC sample, \(\mathcal{R}^{\text{parton}}_{\text{Pythia}}-\mathcal{R}^{\text{parton}}_{ \text{Herwig}}\), is varying from \(-2\%\) at low parton \(p_{\text{T}}\) to smaller values with increasing parton \(p_{\text{T}}\) for inclusive jets. It is about \(-1\%\) for light-quark initiated jets, about \(-2\%\) for \(c\)-jets and varies between \(-1\%\) and \(0.1\%\) for \(b\)-jets.

It is essential to notice that the jet response difference with respect to the parton level is of opposite sign to the one with respect to the stable particle level. This observation implies that the effects arising between the parton level and the stable particle level have an opposite impact on the jet \(p_{\text{T}}\) as compared to the effects arising between the stable particle level and the reconstructed level. Since the parton level response difference is not only smaller than the particle level jet response difference, but of opposite sign, the parton to stable particle difference have a higher magnitude than the stable particle to detector differences.

Figures 3 (a), (b) corroborate the observations made in Section 4 as observed in Figure 1 (b). The particle level jet to parton level response (equivalent to the ratio of the parton level response to the particle level response) is higher in the Powheg+Herwig sample than in the Powheg+Pythia sample. As a consequence, it is expected that the \(W\) mass peak reconstructed from stable particles is shifted towards higher values in the Powheg+Herwig sample than in the Powheg+Pythia sample. The changes in the top mass distribution cannot be explained purely by changes in the energies of the jets, which indicates there are other differences between the two samples.

The response ratio is shown separately for each jet flavour. The dashed lines indicate a response ratio of unity, as well as \(\pm 1\%\) deviations from unity.

## 6 Top mass measurement technique in the \(l\)+jets channel

The standard way to measure the top quark mass in ATLAS is to reconstruct the top quark decay products (\(W\) boson and \(b\)-quark) and to form the invariant mass. The measurement is calibrated using MC simulation. The description of the event selection can be found in Ref. [2]. For the studies presented here, only events with two \(b\)-tagged jets are used. In contrast to the recent ATLAS measurement, no simultaneous systematic variation of \(b\)-tagging scale factors is performed together with any other uncertainty variation. This allows the systematic effects investigated in this note to be decoupled from \(b\)-tagging uncertainties.

In the rest of this section, we briefly describe the methodology used in Ref. [2].

A kinematic likelihood fit [40] is used to reconstruct the kinematics of the \(t\bar{t}\) system. The kinematic likelihood fit relates the reconstructed objects as measured in the detector to the partons from the top quark decay products using a simple leading order picture where the \(t\bar{t}\) decays to \(l\nu b_{l}q_{1}q_{2}b_{\rm had}\) with \(l\) and \(\nu\) being the charged lepton and neutrino, \(q_{1}\) and \(q_{2}\) the quarks from the semi-leptonic (hadronic or leptonic) \(W\)-decays, and \(b_{l}\) and \(b_{\rm had}\) the \(b\)-quark from the top quark decay. The combination of reconstructed objects giving the highest probability to stem from a \(t\bar{t}\) decay is retained for the top quark mass measurements. The reconstructed top quark mass observable (\(m_{\rm top}^{\rm reco}\)) is the parameter fitted from this kinematic likelihood maximisation. Using the detector objects classified as stemming from a \(t\bar{t}\) pair decay the the \(W\) boson mass (\(m_{\rm W}^{\rm reco}\)) can be reconstructed, as well as an observable defined below, called \(\mathcal{R}_{\rm bq}\).

The simplest method uses an unbinned likelihood fit of \(m_{\rm top}\) (one-dimensional analysis) to the reconstructed top quark mass distribution. A better precision can be obtained by using \(m_{\rm top}\) and a scale factor (JSF) that rescales the jet 4-momentum as a single fit parameter (two-dimensional analysis). The JSF is obtained by the best fit to the \(m_{\rm W}^{\rm reco}\) distribution observed in data. This factor accounts for actual differences in the jet energy measurement, e.g. due to flavour differences between the \(t\bar{t}\) sample used in the analysis and the sample used in the calibration, or residual data to MC differences after jet calibration, as well as physics effects like parton showers and hadronisation.

The recent ATLAS \(m_{\rm top}\) measurement has introduced a three-dimensional analysis. In addition to \(m_{\rm top}\) and JSF, a scale factor that changes the \(b\)-jets energy (bJSF) is constrained using the ratio of the \(b\)-jet \(p_{\rm T}\) to the \(p_{\rm T}\) of the jets associated to the \(W\) boson. The \(\mathcal{R}_{\rm bq}\) variable is defined as the ratio of the scalar sum of the transverse momenta of the \(b\)-tagged jets assigned to the leptonically and hadronically decaying top quark to the scalar sum of the transverse momenta of the two untagged jets of the hadronic \(W\) boson decay, \(i.e.\)

\[\mathcal{R}_{\rm bq} = \frac{p_{\rm T}^{b_{\rm had}}+p_{\rm T}^{b_{\rm top}}}{p_{\rm T} ^{q_{1}}+p_{\rm T}^{q_{2}}}.\]

The third fit parameter reduces the uncertainty due to the jet energy measurement of \(b\)-jets.

Templates of these three observables are built, varying the physics parameter (\(m_{\rm top}\)) and nuisance parameters (JSF, bJSF) in the simulation. These distributions are then fitted, and the fitting function parameters are linearly interpolated as a function of these physics and nuisance parameters. This procedure results in a probability density function (PDF) for each observable. The product of the PDFs for the three observables is used to define the final likelihood to be maximised in the data. Pseudo-experiments are performed in the simulation at each \(m_{\rm top}\), JSF and bJSF point to verify the closure of the method. A number of signal and background events corresponding to the data luminosity are drawn and the unbinned likelihood fit tothe pseudo-data is done, simultaneously determining a top quark mass, a JSF and a bJSF. The results are stored for each pseudo-experiments and a fit of the pull distribution to a Gaussian function reveals that the method is unbiased and has proper statistical uncertainties. Finally, an unbinned likelihood fit to the data is performed.

## 7 Results

In the standard procedure the systematic uncertainty due to parton showering and hadronisation is estimated from the difference of the top quark mass fit results obtained from the MC sample using and the one using These two fits make use of templates (see section 6) built with the MC sample. The likelihood resulting from these templates is kept fixed and the two MC samples ( and ) are used as pseudo-data.

To separate the contribution of the parton shower and hadronisation modelling from a change in the jet response (that is included in the JES uncertainty) and from other effects, including the evolution from parton to stable particle jets and changes in the ttbar event topology, the dedicated re-calibration factors (as described in Section 5) are applied to jets in the MC event sample to move the jet response to the one in the sample. The studies are performed using flavour inclusive re-calibration factors, and separately using dedicated re-calibration factors for light-quarks, gluons, \(b\)-quarks and \(c\)-quarks.

Figure 4 shows the best fits to the three observables, \(m_{\mathrm{top}}^{\mathrm{reco}}\), \(m_{\mathrm{W}}^{\mathrm{reco}}\) and \(R_{\mathrm{bq}}^{\mathrm{reco}}\) for the samples used to evaluate the top quark mass uncertainties (the and event samples). For the sample the sample the best fit obtained with the standard jet calibration is compared to the best fit obtained with jets re-calibrated to the calorimeter response of jets in the sample. The lower part of the figure shows the ratio of these two best fit curves obtained from the sample with respect to the one obtained from the sample. Differences in the shapes of the distributions in the samples and samples are clearly visible. Even though the jet re-calibration significantly influences the shape of the distributions - for high values of the reconstructed top quark mass the jet calibration induces changes of up to 5% - differences between both samples remain. Effects of parton showering and hadronisation on the measured top quark mass are thus unlikely to exclusively originate from a pure change in the jet response.

Table 2 summarises the difference of the top quark mass fit results in the and samples. The change of the top quark mass when evaluated with the or samples () obtained with re-calibrated jets with respect to the standard jet calibration is displayed as well as the change in the fitted jet (JSF) and \(b\)-jet (bJSF) scale factors differences between and. These uncertainties and scale factor differences are strongly correlated in the standard jet calibration and in the re-calibrated jets case, as the typical overlap between the event sets is about 95%.

The results of the one-dimensional and two-dimensional analyses do not have significant statistical uncertainties [13]. Due to the introduction of an additional parameter, the three-dimensional analysis has a larger statistical uncertainty. For the uncertainty on the top quark mass due to parton shower and hadronisation, the statistical uncertainty is estimated to be about 0.12. This is approximately 70 % of the related systematic uncertainty.

In the fit using only the top quark mass as fit parameter (one-dimensional analysis) the top quark mass hadronisation uncertainty obtained from the \(t\bar{t}\) MC sample based on Powheg+Pythia and Powheg+Herwig comes from different effects. These include not only the hadronisation uncertainty, but also effects from JES re-calibrations. It is observed that the uncertainty changes sign when using a consistent jet calibration, i.e. re-calibrating the jets for each flavor separately. This indicates that the effects related to the jet response act opposite to other effects related to the transition of parton to hadron jets or to the overall event topology. The uncertainty due to the hadronisation modelling is therefore potentially large even once the jet response differences between the samples are removed. Similar results are obtained for the re-calibration of inclusive jets and of individual jet flavours.

When fitting simultaneously the top quark mass and the jet scale factor (two-dimensional analysis) the hadronisation uncertainty remains the same for the inclusive jet re-calibration and slightly decreases for re-calibration of each jet flavour separately, but the JSF difference doubles. This result is not initially expected, as re-calibrating the JES of Powheg+Pythia to Powheg+Herwig is expected to bring the \(W\) mass peaks in both samples closer to each other, and thus to reduce the JSF difference. However, it is observed in Section 4 that the \(W\) mass peak is shifted towards lower values in Powheg+Pythia with respect to Powheg+Herwig at particle level, \(i.e.\) before calibrating the jets. This effect is also discussed in Section 5.

Figure 3 displays a higher response (detector level to particle level jet energy scale) in Powheg+Pythia than in Powheg+Herwig for light-quark jets. Therefore, applying a re-calibration based on this response ratio shifts the \(W\) mass peak in Powheg+Pythia further away from the \(W\) mass peak in Powheg+Herwig2.

Figure 4: Best fits to the three observables, \(m_{\mathrm{top}}^{\mathrm{reco}}\), \(m_{\mathrm{W}}^{\mathrm{reco}}\) and \(R_{\mathrm{bq}}^{\mathrm{reco}}\). These are shown for \(t\bar{t}\) MC samples based on Powheg+Herwig and Powheg+Pythia with the standard jet calibration and with a dedicated jet calibration for each jet flavour that moves the jet response in the Powheg+Pythia sample to the one in the Powheg+Herwig sample. The lower part of the figure shows the ratio of the two Powheg+Pythia samples and the Powheg+Herwig sample.

This explains the increase of the JSF difference after applying the re-calibration to the Powheg+Pythia sample.

The change in jet response is partially absorbed in the JSF fit parameter. In the case of the two-dimensional analysis the hadronisation uncertainty is particularly large (see Table 1). Since the JSFs do not become closer after the jet re-calibration this indicates that the difference of parton shower and hadronisation effects are rather connected to the transition from partons to jets (based on stable particles) than related to a change in the jet response. This can already be concluded from the observations presented in Section 5.

In the standard top quark mass analysis where the top quark mass, the JSF and the bJSF are determined simultaneously, the hadronisation uncertainty increases by about 30% when changing the jet calibration. Also in this case the difference between the fitted JSFs doubles, coming from the same effect as described for the case of the two-dimensional analysis. This is observed in Figure 4, showing that in the standard three-dimensional analysis the fitted JSF is higher in Herwig than in Pythia. This can be seen by observing the relative positions of the best fits to both these samples for the \(m_{\mathrm{W}}^{\mathrm{reco}}\) observable. This difference is already present in the studies at particle level of Section 4. Again, Figure 3 indicates a higher light-quark jet response, explaining a higher difference once the re-calibration is applied to the Pythia sample.

The difference between the fitted bJSFs is constant after re-calibration of the inclusive jets and decreases by about half when calibrating the jets for each flavour separately. The reduction of the hadronisation uncertainty with respect to the two-dimensional analysis indicates that the \(\mathcal{R}_{\mathrm{bq}}\) variable is also sensitive to hadronisation effects.

The double-counting or underestimation of the hadronisation uncertainty does not have the same impact on the total systematic uncertainty in the two-dimensional analysis and in the three-dimensional analysis (see Table 1), since the relative sizes of hadronisation uncertainties are quite different. Only the two-dimensional analysis appears to be significantly affected by the parton shower and hadronisation uncertainty.

In summary, the jet energy response difference present for different parton shower and hadronisation models cause differences in the reconstructed top quark and \(W\) boson mass distributions. However, once the jet response differences are removed significant effects remain on the top mass that are likely due to the transition of the partons from the top decay to the particle level jets or the \(t\bar{t}\) event topology. In the standard ATLAS top quark mass three-dimensional analysis no significant change in final uncertainty due to the parton shower and hadronisation model is observed. From these studies it can be concluded that the effect of double-counting of the parton shower and hadronisation uncertainties on the 7 TeV ATLAS top quark mass result [2] is most likely small.

## 8 Conclusion

Studies to evaluate the double-counting between the jet energy measurement uncertainty and the uncertainty due to parton shower and hadronisation in the ATLAS top quark mass determination have been carried out by re-calibrating jets in the standard ATLAS top quark mass fit. The amount of double-counting is found to be small in the standard method using three fit parameters and also in the previously used method with two fit parameters. The recent introduction of a fit with three parameters reduces the impact of the parton shower and hadronisation model uncertainty.

The studies in this note demonstrate that the effects of changing the parton shower and the hadronisation model can extend beyond changes that are accounted for in the jet energy calibration. This motivates dedicated studies to establish the exact behaviour of these uncertainties in precision measurements of the top quark mass.
