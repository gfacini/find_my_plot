**Abstract**

The first full-scale prototype of a BOS ATLAS MDT chamber was completed in April 1997 at JINR.

The chamber has dimensions of 3.2 m \(\times\) 1.92 m and consists of 382 drift tubes of 3.2 m length and 30 mm diameter. Tubes are glued in two multilayers fabricated from three layers of 64 drift tubes each. Two multilayers are glued to the two sides of an aluminium support structure (spacer) with 300 mm separation between the two multilayers. The spacer carries a 4-ray RASNIK system for in-plane alignment.

In this note the single drift tube production (wiring), test process, design and FEA of the chamber, chamber construction procedure and mechanical property measurements are described.

Introduction

The Monitored Drift Tubes (MDT) concept for the ATLAS muon spectrometer [1] is based on a high precision positioning of tubes with respect to fiducial marks on the chamber and wire positioning inside a tube with high precision. The precision aimed at is a 20\(\mu\)m RMS on the wire position at the end of the tube and a 100\(\mu\)m tolerance of the tube wall-wire relative position in other points. In order to achieve such precision two conditions have to be fulfilled:

* tubes with adequate tolerances are needed;
* the tubes must be precisely positioned and the build up of the errors must be limited with the use of external jigging

Two basic approaches to the assembly procedure and the design of suitable jigging have been studied [2, 3]. This work was done in the assembling scheme in which the position of tubes is controlled by jigging only for the external tubes of multi-layer, while the internal tubes are positioned by the contact with neighbor tubes (multilayer scheme).

The design (including FEA analysis [4]) of this prototype was done in 1996 and was presented at NIKHEF-96 [5] and other ATLAS muon meetings. The main features of the design are:

I. in single tube-detector production:

- wire positioning is done with respect to the OUTER tube circumference by two V-grooves on both ends of the tube; the wire position is fixed in the central pin by soldering.

II. in chamber assembling:

- "stiff" spacer design, i.e. the spacer was designed in such a way that the sag of the chamber matches the wire sag (no additional stretch mechanism is used);

- three point chamber support scheme with an additional crossplate was proposed, calculated and realized;

## 2 Drift tube production

### Drift tube components

The drift tube components are: an aluminium tube, a W-Re wire, two end-plugs.

The tubes are produced at the Moscow plant VILS (General Russian Institute of Light Alloys) by extrusion from aluminium alloy. This type tube production was initiated and supported by JINR and CERN. The specifications (taken as engineering tolerances) are summarised in table 1.

The end-plugs were produced in JINR using plastic molded components provided by Frascati group [6]. The electrical components were placed inside end-plug. The ground contact was made by soldering to the end-plug aluminium ring.

### Wiring facility

The wiring facility has been built on a cast iron table. Two stainless steel plates have been mounted on the table and adjusted to the same plane using a hydro-level system, which guarantees a precision better than 10\(\mu\)m. Two V-grooves for tube support have been fixed on the plates. Adjustment of the V-grooves was checked by an ALMY sensor [7]. For this purpose a laser beam was directed along the V-grooves and the sensor was moved along its surface in the beam direction. Both coordinates of the beam position were measured for several sensor positions on each V-groove. The adjustment procedure is represented in fig.1. An analysis of this data showed that the error on V-groove positioning is less than 4\(\mu\)m.

For precise wire positioning the procedure very close to [8] was used. This scheme employs two V-shape wire holders with the possibility to tune their position with respect to the V-grooves in both directions.

To find the right position of the wire holders the next procedure was implemented. A high precision steel rod with a diameter equal to the mean outer diameter of the tubes is placed into a V-groove. The wire is stretched between the wire holders and fixed in a coaxial hole in the rod by soldering. Then the rod is rotated and the wire trajectory is visualized with a microscope that allows to observe the differences between the real and nominal positions of the wire holder in both vertical and horizontal directions. After that the holder position is corrected. By repeating this procedure several times one can adjust the wiring setup with an accuracy better than 5\(\mu\)m.

### Study of wire shift caused by soldering/gluing

A dedicated experiment was performed in order to check the stability of the wire position after the wire fixation by soldering or gluing. The wire was stretched in the same position and with the same procedure as during the tube wiring. An end-plug pin was fixed at the position where it would be during a tube wiring so that the

wire passes through the pin hole. The wire position near the pin was controlled with a microscope, which allowed to measure the wire shift in vertical plane with a precision of \(\pm\) 3\(\mu\)m.

With this set-up ten wire gluing and ten wire soldering procedures were performed. A statistical analysis of the microscope readings has given the following results. After the gluing, the average shift of the wire in vertical plane was \(-5\pm 3\mu\)m, where the error is the RMS value of different measurements. In the case of soldering the average shift was \(+7\pm 5\mu\)m. Since the wire shift in horizontal direction was not controlled, the obtained results should be multiplied by a factor of square root of two to get the correct estimation of a possible wire shift due to gluing or soldering.

Our conclusion is that the wire shift due to a soldering procedure does not exceed 15\(\mu\)m and even less in case of gluing, i.e. in both cases we are within the specification of \(\pm\) 20\(\mu\)m.

Figure 1: V-grooves adjustment procedure.

### Assembling procedure

For each tube a measurement of the maximum and minimum diameters was performed and the location of the maximal diameter at both tube ends was marked.

The sequence of drift tube assembling operations is the following:

1. The tube inner surface is cleaned with alcohol.
2. The wire is fixed to a slipping "mouse" and fed through the inclined tube. At the same time the wire is cleaned with alcohol.
3. The end-plugs are cleaned with alcohol, the wire is fed through them and the end-plugs are inserted into the tube.
4. Both end-plugs are crimped in the tube. A water crimp machine was used with crimping pressure of about 300 Bars.
5. The tube is placed into the V-grooves and the wire is fixed on the one side of the table and tensioned with weight of 330g on the other side. After a pretension procedure (additional tension weight is 50g, pretension duration - 1min.) the wire is soldered. The wire shift due to soldering is controlled with two microscopes in both directions.
6. After soldering the wire tension and electrical circuit integrity of the end-plugs have been checked.

It is worth to mention that before soldering and chamber gluing all tubes were oriented upward the mark that indicates the location of the maximum diameter position. We hope that this diminishes the final error of wires positioning.

## 3 MDT electrical tests

This section describes how we verified an operative ability of a drift tube as a particle detector. The test consisted of two stages. The goal of the first stage was to check electrical circuit integrity inside the end-plugs. This test was relatively fast: it takes less than 1 minute per tube. Rectangular pulses from generator were fed to the HV socket of the tube and the output signal from the other side was observed with an oscilloscope. If there is circuit damage then the shape and amplitude of the output signal are significantly distorted.

The main test was performed at close to real conditions. Tubes were filled with DACHA gas, 3 gas volumes were changed to reach a reasonable gas mixture purity. An L3 preamplifier was used. We were forced to set the threshold to about 70 electrons because of a pick up problem.

The counting rate was measured for cosmic particles in the voltage range of 2.9-3.6kV. No radioactive sources were used. The counting rate was about 60Hz forgood tubes. For the most of the tubes the signal shape was also observed with an oscilloscope to exclude low amplitude discharges. For some part of the tubes the terminator resistor was not installed. For these tubes the counting rate was almost triple the normal one due to signal reflections. Typical curves of counting rate vs. HV and counting rate distribution for voltage of 3.3 and 3.5kV are shown in fig. 2 and 3.

In total 309 tubes have been tested.

* 20 tubes with broken wire were found with fast test.

Figure 2: Counting rate vs. voltage for tubes with terminator resistor (first plot) and without terminator resistor (second plot).

- the plato is at least up to 3.6kV, without any discharges, good signal shape.
* plato ends at 3.45-3.6kV, or small discharge above the operating point (3.3kV).
* 20 tubes had no terminator resistor, but were good in other aspects. They had been placed in the prototype as a compact group.

Figure 3: Counting rate distribution for 3.3 and 3.5kV voltage. The filled area corresponds to tubes without terminator resistor.

* 19 tubes were found to be noisy, but after some training (0.5-1.5 hour) began to work normally.
* 10 tubes with substantial noise were placed in the prototype as a compact group for two reasons: to study the working ability of noisy tubes and as some of them after training may become usable.
* Other 32 tubes were regarded as unusable due to a strong discharge or because of breaks of electrical circuit inside the end-plug.

At least in 20% of cases a generation began when the preamplifier had been connected to the tube. The most probable cause is a poor ground contact. Tubes were intentionally connected to the preamplifier only via the ground socket of the end-plug in order to test the grounding quality. Often it was enough to re-connect preamplifier with the socket to stop the generation, but it looks like that our grounding scheme (the aluminium ring was soldered to conductor which was connected to the ground socket - all inside end-plug) is not good enough and it is better to make a direct connection between the tubes and the Faraday cage.

## 4 Leak test of drift tubes

The requirement on the leak level of a single drift tube (\(\sim 10^{-5}\)mbar\(\cdot\)l/s) is determined by the leak specification for the whole muon system. To detect such a small leak a very sensitive equipment is required. An equipment has to be sufficiently fast because a large number of drift tubes has to be measured during the mass production.

During the prototype production we have used an industrial device TNS-31 produced in Russia. This differential manometer measures the pressure difference between sensitive and external volumes. It can measure the pressure difference in the range of \(\pm 3.8\)torr with an accuracy of \(4.5\cdot 10^{-3}\) torr. It can operate at absolute pressure up to 10Bars. In our conditions it takes \(\sim 7.5\) minutes per tube to reach the required accuracy on leak level.

The way to use a differential manometer for leak detection is to place it inside a steel hermetic barrel and to connect the sensitive volume of the manometer to the tube tested.

The procedure of our leak test is the following (see fig.4):

* a gas source is connected both to the barrel and to the tube tested and the pressure is set to 5Bars (argon is used)
* the gas source is disconnected and 5 minutes are waited to achieve a thermal equilibrium
* the barrel and the tube tested are disconnected from each other and the pressure decrease is measured during 3-5 minutes.

In this procedure it is important to have a small barrel leak. We have achieved \(<10^{-10}\) mbar\(\cdot\)l/s barrel leak.

To accelerate the test procedure we have used 20 parallel channels. Each tube can be individually connected to the nanometer sensitive volume. In this case the time needed to reach a thermal equilibrium is the same for all channels.

Figure 5: Distribution of DT leak rates.

The distribution of the leak rates for the drift tubes we have used in the prototype is represented fig.5.

## 5 Chamber design

As it was mentioned above we followed a "non-adjustable" scheme and tried to design such spacer structure (SS) where the tube bent in multilayers matches the wire sag with a required accuracy (for a BOS-chamber the wire sag is about 160\(\mu\)m) without any "stretch" mechanism. Two variants of a BOS-chamber with three supporting points were investigated, including FEA method for chamber deflection calculation.

The scheme of the SS for the first variant is shown in fig.17. The distribution of BOS-chamber deformations in the middle section (in Y direction) is shown in the same figure. In our opinion, the bending of the Right Cross Plate (RCP) itself (about 29\(\mu\)m) was unacceptably large and it might cause alignment problems. Besides, this RCP has been bent in the opposite to the Left Cross Plate (LCP) sag direction, that made the situation worse in our opinion.

That is why another scheme of the BOS-chamber SS has been suggested, designed and the necessary calculations have been carried out. This scheme and distribution of chamber deformations in the middle section (in Y direction) are shown in fig.18. The results seem to be acceptable.

More detailed information about the calculations is given below. The design of the prototype is briefly described hereafter and represented in fig.6. There are two multilayers and a spacer structure (SS) of 300 mm height in between. As it was mentioned above, the three point support scheme was realized using "STAR 40" bearings. The BOS chamber has a built-in RASNIK system [10] for in-plane alignment.

Every multilayer consists of three layers with 64 (63 for central layer) aluminium tubes of 30 mm diameter each, glued together.

The SS is shown in fig.7. It comprises:

1. RASNIK in-plane alignment components;
2. two longbeams (LB);
3. three crossplates: 1. middle crossplate (MCP); 2. left crossplate (LCP); 3. right crossplate (RCP);
4. additional plate (AP).

Figure 6: Sketch of BOS-chamber.

Figure 7: Sketch of spacer structure.

The last one (AP) is a very important part of the SS design (see fig.18) because in our opinion an AP allows to solve the problem of RCP deformation minimization (one bearing side).

This additional plate should positively affect the performance of in-plane alignment and should compensate possible support displacements (only a few kg is necessary to bend the AP so that the support has to be moved by 10mm in X direction). The SS has been assembled using a special jig (see below) and bonded by ARALDITE-106 glue.

The MCP consists of (see fig.8):

1. aluminium plate of 12 mm thickness;
2. two aluminium sheets of 3 mm thickness;
3. four aluminium angle brackets of 3 mm thickness.

All these details are bonded in a special device, using ARALDITE-106 glue. A glued MCP looks like I-beam (in cross section) and has special cutouts for lenses.

Figure 8: Cross section of MCP.

The LCP and the RCP are uniform, but they differ from the MCP and each of them consists of (see fig.9):

1. big vertical aluminium plate of 12 mm thickness;
2. two narrow aluminium plates (top and bottom) of 12 mm thickness each;
3. four rectangular tubes;
4. four thin sheets of 0.4 mm thickness or less.

Similar to MCP assembling, both outer crossplates have been assembled and bonded in a special device, using the same glue. To avoid temperature expansion problems, a "flex" principle has been used in the LCP and RCP design: the upper and lower parts of each outer crossplates are not connected rigidly to the middle (vertical) part (on which the RASNIK components are placed). Looking at the fig.9, it is clear how we could achieve such result. One short notice: if minimum thickness sheets (less than 0.1mm) are used it would be very important to avoid any gap between the big vertical aluminium plate and two horizontal small plates. In this case the top multilayer "lays" immediately on the top of vertical part of crossplate, and the bottom (at this moment!) multilayer hangs (touching in the same time the bottom part of vertical crossplate!) on the very thin strips. The advantages of this - maximum height of the crossplate (what means maximum rigidity and therefore minimum bending). A possible deficiency is a relatively big f

have appropriate cutouts for placement of four LED illuminated masks (on LCP) and two CCD (on RCP).

The design of the LB and MCP is similar. The LB's have no cutouts for the RASNIK elements, but have one rectangular hole in the middle for MCP adjustment. Besides, the LB's are longer than the MCP.

It should be noted, that longbeams and crossplates have the same height, which is not usual for the other MDT spacer structures.

### Chamber calculations

For calculation of several variants of the BOS chamber design a finite element analysis (FEA) was used. The variants mentioned differ in methods of supporting the chamber. Besides that, different cross sections of the longitudinal beams and crossplates were studied for each variant of support. They were optimized to minimize the difference of the wire and tube sags. It is obvious, that the variant with four supporting points is better from the multilayer deformation point of view. But in this case an adjustment of fourth point position is required. That is why the solution with three supporting points was selected finally.

Three dimensional FEA models based on the current geometry were proposed for the BOS prototype variants. The symmetry of the models allowed to use for analysis only a half of the chamber. The shell elements were used to model the longitudinal beams and cross plates. Thick shell elements were used for multilayers. FEA model included about 1200 nodes and 1200 elements. The material, which was used for the spacer structure of the BOS design was aluminium alloy. In reality the multilayers are made of aluminium tubes. But in the FEA model multilayers were represented using thick shell ortotropick elements, the pseudo-properties of which were obtained in preliminary estimates. In all variants the BOS chamber was oriented horizontally and a gravity load was applied.

The deformed shape of a half of the BOS chamber FEA model with three supporting points and additional plate (for 3-rd point) is shown in fig.19. The shape and value of multilayer deformations in this variant are shown in fig.18.

In the design variant with the third point of fastening located on the outer cross plate (see fig.17) displacements of the multilayer ends of are different. On the part with two points of fastening the middle of the multilayers is below the ends, and on the part with one point of fastening the ends are below the middle. To eliminate this defect the variant with the third point of fastening located on an additional cross plate was proposed. In this case the shape of multilayer deformations is closer to one of the variant with four support points.

### Jig assembly

As it was mentioned above the multilayers, the spacer structure and the BOS chamber itself were assembled in a special device (jig). So far as we used a "non-gap"multilayer principle, our jig design and assembly procedure were very close to the Seattle ones [2].

More difficult parts of the jig (from production point of view) were precise combs of quite big length (2.4 m). It was impossible (very expensive) to get a precise machining of the whole comb, so each comb was assembled from 3 short (about 0.8 m) precise parts. They have been made with the help of our Protvino colleagues at IHEP workshop with the required accuracy. Then the combs themselves were assembled (bonded and screwed) on a special flat bench (the surface flatness was better than 10\(\mu\)m) in turned over position, using ARALDITE-106 glue.

The jig (see fig.10) was mounted on a special steel frame, hardly adjusted to vibration-isolated foundation. It consists of:

1. 5 precise bottom combs of 2.4 m length;
2. 5 precise top combs of 2.4 m length;
3. 10 precise side blocks;
4. set of precise rods (about 100).

Five bottom combs were distributed uniformly along chamber length. After mounting combs on the frame their positions were adjusted with the aid of special screws. Each comb had three adjustable places (left, middle, right) with six adjustment screws at each place.

Figure 10: Sketch of the jig.

The combs were aligned using a hydro-level and an MPI-ALMY Si-strip detector [7]. A hydro-level is a device, which allows to measure the difference of levels (vertical coordinate, or axis Y) between two points with a precision of about 5\(\mu\)m. An MPI-ALMY sensor can measure a laser beam position with a precision of few micrometers in both coordinates. The jig alignment procedure was iterative. The level (Y coordinate) was measured by the hydro-level. The alignment of the comb shifts in the horizontal plane and rotation angles was made using the ALMY sensor. The procedure of this alignment was the following(see fig.11). On the comb reference surface four rods (30cm length) were placed. Atop of them two short rods were placed. One of them was glued to the ALMY sensor. A laser beam was directed along X axis, which is approximately parallel to the comb cylinder grooves axis. So, we were able to move the sensor exactly along the reference direction (cylinder grooves axis) in the \(\pm\)2cm range. By measuring the laser beam coordinates at several points along the comb reference direction one can find the position and the angle with respect to the laser beam. The angle measurement precision was about 400\(\mu\)rad in our case. In such a way we put all corresponding parts of the combs in a line. Repeating this procedure for left, middle and right parts of the combs we achieved the alignment of the combs' reference surfaces for these parts.

Given the precise pitch of the combs and all 5\(\times\)3 points have the same Y-coordinate, which is measured by the hydro-level, all these points lay on three parallel lines. After all, we set all 5\(\times\)3 adjustable points of the jig, all in one level within 20\(\mu\)m, in line with \(\pm\)10\(\mu\)m Z-coordinate precision, and with 400\(\mu\)rad angle precision.

### Chamber assembly

The chamber has been assembled and bonded in the following sequence:

1. preassembling of the SS on the table;
2. assembling (gluing) of the SS in the jig;
3. removing of the bonded SS from the jig;
4. gluing of the first multilayer in the jig;
5. adjustment (gluing) of the SS to the multilayer in the jig;
6. removing of the bonded unit (SS + multilayer) from the jig;
7. gluing of the second multilayer in the jig;
8. adjustment (gluing) of the bonded unit (SS + multilayer) to the second multilayer in the jig.

### SS assembly

The SS has been assembled and bonded in the jig from preassembled units (crossplates, longbeams, etc.) in two stages:

Stage 1 (preassembling on a flat table without gluing):

1. 2 couples of precise calibers were attached to the ends of the LCP and RCP;
2. 2 longbeams were "hafted" on the ends of the MCP;
3. couple of precise calibers was adjusted to the ends of the MCP;
4. LCP and RCP were "hafted" on the ends of the long beams;
5. AP was adjusted to the RCP using special aluminium plates. Stage 2:

Figure 11: Jig alignment scheme.

This preassembled non rigid structure has been removed from the table and set to the three bottom combs of the jig. In this case special precise rods were used, which have been inserted in between combs and calibers. In the same time the longbeams were rested on the bottom combs and fitted to get gaps in between combs and longbeams as same as possible. After that all required places have been glued by ARALDITE-106 using special angle brackets in the crossplate-longbeam adjust places.

Once the epoxy has cured, the SS has been removed from the jig and set aside (on the previous table).

### Multilayer assembly

As it was mentioned above, for multilayer assembly we followed the "non-gap" scheme, in which the position of the tubes is controlled by jigging only for external layers of a multilayer, while the internal layers (in our case - layer) are positioned by the contact with neighbor tubes [3]. In this case special precise side blocks and rods were used except for the top and bottom combs (see fig.10).

We have used the technology and equipment, described in [9]. The idea is that tubes are placed in the assembly jig layer by layer, forming a multilayer without any glue. Then epoxy is placed into the triangle shaped holes. This is accomplished by a special epoxy dispensing head, which conforms to the shape of the opening at the intersection of three tubes. The glue is pumped (under pressure of 10bar) to the dispensing head through a plastic tube. There are three small holes on the glue dispensing head, which allow the epoxy to enter the three corners of the triangle. It took about 6 hours to distribute the glue for one multilayer.

To avoid a "banana" effect three Al-strips (1mm thick) were bonded to the bottom of each multilayer.

## 6 MDT chamber mechanical properties measurements

### RASNIK system internal precision test

To study the resolution of the RASNIK system [10] we have assembled a model RASNIK system, one part of which is movable.

The RASNIK mask has been mounted on an AEROTECH linear stage, which can be positioned with a precision of about 1\(\mu\)m. The CCD has been fixed. For that system we used lens with a focal length of 4cm. The images were readout by a framegrabber from 768x512 pixel CCIR CCD. Coordinate calculations were performed by means of RASMI program [11], which has been modified to run under OpenVMS and MSDOS operating systems.

In our case, the zero-coordinate or in the other words offset, was not known, so it was found from fit. The mask pitch has been fixed to nominal value of 2\(\times\)120\(\mu\)m. This value is the reference length for the RASMI program. The results of the scan are shown in fig. 12 and 13. Here \(\Delta X/X\) is the deviation of the optimal (found from the fit) from used (240\(\mu\)m) mask pitch. One can see that in the \(\pm\)1 mm range the coordinate precision is better than 1\(\mu\)m RMS (the linear stage positioning error is also contributing here) and maximal deviation doesn't exceed 2.5\(\mu\)m. The pitch deviation, we think, is explained by some inclination of the CCD mask with respect to the stage movement line.

Figure 12: Error on coordinate versus coordinate for the first Mask/CCD.

### Spacer rigidity measurement

The spacer has been designed in such a way, that the sag of the chamber should be approximately equal to the sag of the anode wires. More exactly, the goal was to minimize the average difference between the wire and the chamber gravitational sag. So, the correctness of spacer flexibility calculation is crucial. To verify the calculations we have measured the actual rigidity of the spacer. Here we will use the term "rigidity", which we define as a coefficient of proportionality between the saggitta, caused by the force applied to the center of the element and the force value (see fig.14). The measurement was performed with the aid of mechanical position sensors and the RASNIK in-plane alignment system, mounted on the spacer. The load has been made using lead bricks. The results of the measurement are shown in fig.15. According to calculations these values should be: 1.42\(\mu\)m/kg for longbeam,

Figure 13: Error on coordinate versus coordinate for the second Mask/CCD.

Figure 14: Rigidity measurement.

Figure 15: Longbeam rigidity.

0.27\(\mu\)m/kg for central crossplate and 0.49\(\mu\)m/kg for end crossplate. The numbers are in a good agreement except for the measured rigidity of the central crossplate, which is 20% higher than the calculation. This is apparently explained by a coupling of the crossplate and the longbeams.

### Chamber deformations due to temperature gradient

In this study the deformations of the chamber, such as sagittas of the longbeam and crossplate, induced by the temperature difference between the multilayers, were measured. In the ATLAS working conditions the temperature difference between the multilayers of an MDT chamber could be of 2-3K. Therefore this measurement is necessary to estimate the magnitude of the effect.

The chamber has been mounted horizontally on three supports. The upper multilayer of the chamber was heated by two electrical blankets. The heat power of the blankets can be regulated in 10 steps up to 55 watt. Seven temperature sensors have been inserted inside each multilayer. The location of the sensors is shown in fig.21. The chamber RASNIK system was used for deformation measurements. The "longbeam sagitta" (see fig.22) was assumed to be equal to a half-sum of the lens shifts for ray 1 and ray 4 (see fig.20) and "crossplate sagitta" (actually the central crossplate sagitta) was calculated as a difference between the half-sum of the lens shifts for ray 2 and ray 3 and the "longbeam sagitta". A "spirality" is the angle between the end crossplates. It is calculated as a difference between the mask 2 and mask 3 shifts divided by the distance between the masks. Of course, if the chamber and supports are symmetrical the "spirality" should be zero for uniform heating. Nevertheless, even in our case, the uniformness was not ideal, and we did observe this type of deformation. Therefore, this parameter has an order of magnitude meaning only.

The procedure of the measurement was the following: at each value of the blankets heat power, after some settle time (2-4 hours), the readings of the temperature sensors and RASNIK system were stored down. Some delay after the change of the heat power is necessary to reach stationary heat flows. Actually the readout was made continuously with the period of 800 seconds to ensure that the stabilization is reached. The dependencies of the sample temperature and sagitta on time are shown in fig.23.

The results of the measurements are shown in fig.16. Statistical errors and errors due to precision of the sensors are quite small (\(\approx\) 0.3\(\mu\)m and 0.05K). However the systematic error due to incompleteness of thermal dynamic equilibrium and temperature gradient inside the multilayer is estimated to be approximately 10%. So the final numbers are: "longbeam sagitta" is 6.3\(\pm\)0.7\(\mu\)m/K, "crossplate sagitta" is -0.96\(\pm\)0.4\(\mu\)m/K and "spirality" is 5.9\(\pm\)0.6\(\mu\)rad/K. Finally, we can say, that for our chamber at temperature differences between multilayers in the range of 0-3K, deformations of the sagitta type are not critical because the "longbeam sagitta" (20\(\mu\)m) doesn't affect the anode wire locations and is below the "wall" tolerance of \(100\mu\)m and "crossplate sagitta" (\(3\mu\)m) is smaller than the "wire" tolerance of \(10\mu\)m. But "spirality" deformation noticeably disturb the wire positions in the three point chamber support scheme. Thus, the RASNIK in-plane alignment system has, at least, one thing to monitor.
