**Abstract**

**We study the possibility of measuring, in the ATLAS experiment at the LHC, the CP-violation parameters in the processes \(B_{d}^{0}\to\)J/\(\psi K_{s}^{0}\) and \(B_{d}^{0}\to\pi^{+}\pi^{-}\) by analysing the expected time-dependent asymmetries in these channels with a maximum-likelihood technique.**

## 1Introduction

**One of the main goals of experimental heavy flavour physics is the measurement of CP-violating asymmetries in the \(B_{d}^{0}\bar{B}_{d}^{0}\) system. The Standard Model of electroweak interactions foresees CP violation due to the presence of a complex phase in the CKM matrix** **[**1**]****: this violation implies the appearance of asymmetries in neutral B meson decays to CP eigenstates.**

**The Large Hadron Collider will be a powerful b-hadron factory: the expected cross-section for beauty production is between 100 and 500 \(\mu\)b for \(pp\) collisions at \(\sqrt{s}\,=\,14\) TeV, to be compared with the expected \(pp\) inelastic non-diffractive cross-section of \(\sim 80\) mb. In particular, the ATLAS detector** **[**2**]** **can be used for extensive beauty physics studies, at least during the first years of low luminosity operation (**\({\cal L}\approx 10^{33}\) **cm**\({}^{-2}\) **s**\({}^{-1}\)). The CP-violating phase can be measuredusing the time-dependent asymmetry analysis of the processes \(B_{d}^{0}\rightarrow\mathrm{J}/\psi\,\mathrm{K}_{S}^{0}\), \(B_{d}^{0}\rightarrow\,\pi^{+}\pi^{-}\), which are sensitive to the angles \(\beta\) and \(\alpha\) of the unitarity triangle, respectively.

In this note a method (based on a maximum-likelihood fit) for measuring the CP violation parameters and their related uncertainties via a time-dependent analysis is presented.

## 2 The method

\(B_{d}^{0}\) decays are triggered via muons with \(p_{T}>6\) GeV/c and \(|\eta|<2.2\) (which is the ATLAS L1 trigger requirement for B-physics) produced in semileptonic decays of the B-hadrons associated to the \(B_{d}^{0}\) decaying in the chosen channel; the charge of the trigger muon is used to tag the production of \(B_{d}^{0}-\bar{B}_{d}^{0}\) states: if the trigger is given by a \(\mu^{+}\) (generated in the semileptonic decay \(\bar{b}\rightarrow\bar{c}\mu^{+}\nu_{\mu}\)), the reconstructed \(B\)-meson on the opposite side of the same event must contain a \(b\) quark, so that it is tagged as a \(\bar{B}_{d}^{0}\) meson (\(b\bar{d}\) bound state); analogously, the reconstructed \(B\)-meson associated to a tag \(\mu^{-}\) is classified as a \(B_{d}^{0}\) (\(\bar{b}d\) bound state). This way, the events are classified into two groups (according to the charge sign of the tag lepton). At this point, as far as the CP violation study is concerned, two kinds of analysis are possible:

* a time-integrated analysis, based only on the classification of the events according to the tag;
* a time-dependent analysis, taking into account, beside the tag, the proper time distribution of the reconstructed \(B\) mesons.

The time-integrated analysis of the CP asymmetry in the process \(B_{d}^{0}\rightarrow\mathrm{J}/\psi\mathrm{K}_{S}^{0}\) was described in ref. [3]. Now the time-dependent analysis will be outlined.

The rate of events with positive/negative tag, as a function of the meson proper time \(\tau\), is proportional to the quantity:

\[F_{\pm}(\tau)=\{(1-B)[(1-W)R(\tau,\pm 1)+WR(\tau,\mp 1)]+B\}\exp^{-\Gamma\tau} \tag{1}\]

where \(B\) is the background fraction (the background is assumed to have the same effective lifetime as the signal), \(W\) is the fraction of events with a wrong tag, and \(R(\tau,\pm 1)\) is a function depending on the \(B^{0}\) decay channel. The wrong tags are due to various sources:

* \(\bar{B}^{0}_{d,s}\) oscillations;
* \(b\) quark cascade decays;
* further \(c\bar{z}\), \(b\bar{b}\) pairs generated in the event;
* light meson decays in flight and hadron punchthrough;
* top quark decays.

These wrong tags lead to a dilution of the oscillation of the proper time distributions of both classes of events, due to the confusion between \(B^{0}\) and \(\bar{B^{0}}\) states. The wrong tag fraction was estimated with a Monte Carlo simulation [2]: it is about 24% if we consider all the effects mentioned above (time-integrated analysis). The dilution due to the mixing on the tag side (where we integrate over the proper time of the B hadron that gives the tag) is included in the formulae for \(R(\tau,\pm 1)\), as we shall see later; the estimated value of \(W\) is 0.12.

As far as the background rate is concerned, we assume that it is asymmetry free and that it has the same proper time exponential decay as the signal rate, due to the fact that the background is mainly due to B-hadron decays, in both of the processes under study [2].

We have generated events with a simple Monte Carlo algorithm, based on eq. (1):

* the charge sign of the tag lepton is chosen taking into account the charge asymmetry \(A_{\cal G}=\int_{0}^{\infty}[F_{-}(\tau)-F_{+}(\tau)]d\tau/\int_{0}^{\infty}[F_ {-}(\tau)+F_{+}(\tau)]d\tau\);
* the \(B^{0}_{d}\) proper time is chosen, according to eq. (1) normalized properly.

The total number of events is the one expected in one year at \(10^{33}\) cm\({}^{-2}\)\(s^{-1}\) in ATLAS; for a more realistic simulation, we chose the events with proper time greater than 0.5 ps.

Afterwards, the selected events are used to write the event-by-event likelihood function:

\[L\ =\ \prod_{i=1}^{N_{ave}}f_{\epsilon}(\tau_{i};x_{1},...,x_{k}) \tag{2}\]where \(\mathbf{z}_{1},...,\mathbf{z}_{k}\) are the fit parameters, \(N_{acc}\) is the number of accepted events (\(\tau>\bar{\tau}\), with \(\bar{\tau}=0.5\) ps), \(c\) is the tag muon charge sign and

\[f_{e}\,=\,\lambda(\mathbf{z}_{1},...,\mathbf{z}_{k})\,F_{e}(\tau;\mathbf{z}_{1},...,\mathbf{z}_{ k}) \tag{3}\]

where the \(\lambda\) factor (depending on the fit parameters) is obtained via the normalization constraint

\[\sum_{e=\pm 1}\int_{\tau}^{\infty}f_{e}(\tau;\mathbf{z}_{1},...,\mathbf{z}_{k})\,d \tau\,=\,1\,. \tag{4}\]

The maximum likelihood method consists in the search for the values \((\bar{x_{1}},...,\bar{x_{k}})\) at which the function \(L\) (which can be considered as a probability distribution) resches a maximum, that is where \(-\ln L\) has a minimum.

The calculations described above were made using the MINUIT package [5]. MINUIT also computes the 1 \(\sigma\) uncertainty on each fitting parameter, which is given by the interval of values for which \(-\ln(L/L_{max})\leq 0.5\).

This method is complementary to other kinds of analysis such as the one described in Ref. [3]. In this preliminary study the secondary vertex resolution is neglected; we expect this assumption will not affect the results of the analysis, due to the fact that the \(B_{d}^{0}\) oscillation period (about 12 ps) is long compared to the proper time resolution (expected to be \(\sim 5\%\) of the B meson lifetime for a typical boost, as the secondary vertex resolution is estimated to be \(\sim\)50 \(\mu\)m [2]): this has been checked via a simple \(\chi^{2}\) time-dependent fit [3]. Besides, we assume that the acceptance, as a function of the \(B_{d}^{0}\) proper time, is a constant.

## 3 Time-dependent asymmetry in \(B_{d}^{0}\to J/\psi K_{S}^{0}\)

In this channel we have:

\[R(\tau,\pm 1)=(f_{u}+f_{b})[1\mp\sin 2\beta\sin(\Delta m_{B_{d}^{ 0}}\,\tau)]+\] \[+f_{a}[1\mp\sin 2\beta\sin(\Delta m_{B_{d}^{0}}\,\tau)/(1+\mathbf{z}_{ d}^{2})]+\] \[+f_{s}[1\mp\sin 2\beta\sin(\Delta m_{B_{d}^{0}}\,\tau)/(1+\mathbf{z}_{ s}^{2})]\;. \tag{5}\]

This function depends on the angle \(\beta\) of the unitarity triangle; furthermore, it takes into account the mistag due to the mixing of the associated \(B_{d}^{0}\) and \(B_{s}^{0}\) mesons, and the relative contributions of the several b-hadron species which 

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:5]

resulting statistical uncertainty on \(\sin 2\beta\) is between 0.018 and 0.019, compatible with the one obtained with the time-integrated analysis [3]. In Fig. 1 the time-dependent asymmetry is shown, for \(\sin 2\beta=0.6\) and an integrated luminosity of \(10^{4}\) pb\({}^{-1}\); the result of the event-by-event likelihood fit is superimposed.

We also evaluated the statistical uncertainties reachable via a simultaneous fit of \(\sin 2\beta\) and \(x_{d}\): \(\delta(\sin 2\beta)\) is between 0.018 and 0.020, not degraded significantly with respect to the result of the one parameter fit; the resulting statistical uncertainty on \(x_{d}\) decreases from about 0.060 for an input value \(\sin 2\beta=0.2\) to about 0.015 for an input value \(\sin 2\beta=0.9\).

If we repeat the experiment for a certain number of times, we obtain distributions of the values and uncertainties on the parameters. Besides, for each parameter, the sigma of the distribution has been compared with the uncertainty on the parameter itself provided by MINUIT. In Fig. 2 the distribution of the fitted \(\sin 2\beta\) values for 400 simulated experiments is represented (the events are generated for \(\sin 2\beta=0.6\)); the related distribution of the quantity \([(\sin 2\beta)_{fit}-(\sin 2\beta)_{true}]/\delta(\sin 2\beta)\) is shown in Fig. 3: it is fitted by a gaussian

curve centered at zero with \(\sigma\simeq 1\), and this confirms that the fit algorithm is correct.

## 4 Time-dependent asymmetry in \(B_{d}^{0}\rightarrow\pi^{+}\pi^{-}\)

In this channel we have:

\[R(\tau,\pm 1)=(f_{u}+f_{b})[1\pm g(\tau)]+f_{d}[1\pm g(\tau)/(1+z_{d}^{2})]+f_{s}[ 1\pm g(\tau)/(1+z_{s}^{2})]\, \tag{8}\]

with [8]

\[g(\tau)=(\sin 2\alpha+2\rho\cos\delta\cos 2\alpha\sin\alpha) \sin(z_{d}\Gamma_{B_{d}^{2}\tau})+\] \[+2\rho\sin\delta\sin\alpha\cos(z_{d}\Gamma_{B_{d}^{2}\tau})\ ; \tag{9}\]

\(R\) depends on the angle \(\alpha\) of the unitarity triangle, on a phase \(\delta\) due to final state strong interactions between the two pions, and on the parameter \(\rho=A_{P}/A_{T}\), where \(A_{P}\) and \(A_{T}\) are the penguin and tree diagram amplitude respectively: the penguin diagrams in this channel give rise to theoretical uncertainties, as the value of \(\rho\) is not precisely known (it is estimated to be between 0 and 0.4 [8]) and their contribution, in principle, is not negligible: in this note we put \(\rho=0.2\pm 0.2\). The first-level trigger selection is given again by a muon with \(p_{T}>6\) GeV/c, \(|\eta|<2.2\), coming from the semileptonic decay of the associated B-hadron, which also tags the \(B_{d}^{0}\). The evaluation of the expected number of events in one year of run at the LHC must take into account wrong combinations due to the decays \(B_{s}^{0}\to K^{+}\pi^{-}\), \(B_{d}^{0}\to K^{+}\pi^{-}\), \(B_{s}^{0}\to K^{+}K^{-}\), \(\Lambda_{b}\to p\,\pi^{-}\) with an invariant mass close to the \(B_{d}^{0}\) mass. A detailed simulation [2] for a one-year run with the ATLAS detector at \(10^{33}\) cm\({}^{-2}\) s\({}^{-1}\) gives 14160 events within a 50 MeV interval around the \(B_{d}^{0}\) mass, with a \(\sim 50\%\) background.

We generated a sample of 14160 events, choosing the reference values \(\rho=0.2\), \(\cos\delta=0\). The results for the statistical uncertainty on \(\sin 2\alpha\) are summarized in Table 1.

As there is no theoretical constraint on \(\delta\), we generated events using different values of \(\cos\delta\); the results stay in agreement with the ones shown in Table 1. In Fig. 4 the time-dependent asymmetry for \(\sin 2\alpha=0.6\), \(\rho=0.2\) and \(\cos\delta=0.5\) is shown: the continuous line is the fit to \(\sin 2\alpha\) using the input values for \(\rho\) and \(\delta\).

The systematic contributions, due to the poor theoretical knowledge of \(\rho\) and \(\delta\), to the uncertainty on \(\sin 2\alpha\), were estimated by generating events with \(\rho=0.2\) and \(\cos\delta=0\) fixed; then we made a fit to \(\sin 2\alpha\), with values of \(\rho\) and \(\cos\delta\) (in the likelihood function) varying in their respective ranges of uncertainty: the typical systematic \(\sin 2\alpha\) deviation is between 0.2 and 0.3. A further uncertainty arises from an analytical two- or four-fold ambiguity in the simultaneous fit to \(\sin 2\alpha\) and \(\cos\delta\), as shown in Ref. [9]. This difficulty can be avoided if we put \(-2\rho\sin\delta\sin\alpha\equiv\Lambda_{e}\), \(-(\sin 2\alpha+2\rho\cos\delta\cos 2\alpha\sin\alpha)\equiv\Lambda_{s}\), and fit these two parameters. Eventually, we get \(\delta\Lambda_{e}\simeq 0.067-0.069\) and \(\delta\Lambda_{s}\simeq 0.056-0.059\).

\begin{tabular}{||c|c||} \hline \(\sin 2\alpha\) & \(\delta(\sin 2\alpha)\) \\ \hline \(-0.9\div-0.4\) & \(0.045\div 0.046\) \\ \(-0.4\div+0.8\) & \(0.046\div 0.047\) \\
0.9 & \(0.043\) \\ \hline \end{tabular}

Conclusions

The maximum log-likelihood method is a way to estimate a given parameter from an experimental distribution that avoids losing information by binning. The analysis of time-dependent CP asymmetries in \(B_{4}^{0}\) decays to CP eigenstates with this method permits to estimate the parameters \(\sin 2\beta\) and \(\sin 2\alpha\), which depend on the CP violating phase of the CKM matrix. In particular, the statistics that the ATLAS experiment is expected to collect in \(\sim 10^{7}\) s is sufficient to obtain a statistical uncertainty lower than 0.02 on \(\sin 2\beta\) and lower than 0.05 on \(\sin 2\alpha\); in the latter case, the effect of systematic uncertainties and analytical ambiguities can be overtaken by introducing two auxiliary parameters \(\Lambda_{e}\), \(\Lambda_{s}\): their expected statistical uncertainties are less than 0.07 and less than 0.06, respectively.
