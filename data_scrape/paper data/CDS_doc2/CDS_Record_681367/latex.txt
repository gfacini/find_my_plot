###### Abstract

The resolution and efficiency performance of a monitored drift-tube chamber of type BOS was investigated under different levels of photon irradiation. The chamber was irradiated with a photon count rate up to 183 s\({}^{-1}\)cm\({}^{-2}\). A silicon detector was used as external reference. As a result, the spatial resolution of a drift tube is degraded by 20 \(\mu\)m at the highest background rate. While the tube efficiency is unchanged under irradiation, the probability of a wrong measurement of an impact radius is increased by 11 %.

The consequences of the operation of the chamber at a reduced gas pressure are also discussed in the article.

[FOOTNOIntroduction

The environment in which the precision chambers of the ATLAS muon spectrometer are operated is characterized by high neutron and \(\gamma\) background. Monitored drift-tube chambers will experience background count rates ranging from 8 s\({}^{-1}\)cm\({}^{-2}\) to 100 s\({}^{-1}\)cm\({}^{-2}\)[1]. In order to certify the high-rate capability of detectors used in the LHC experiments, a 740 GBq \({}^{137}\)Cs source is provided at CERN's gamma irradiation facility. Filters in front of the source allow the variation of the irradiation of detectors behind. In addition a highly energetic muon beam is available.

Single drift tubes were certified for their use in the muon spectrometer in 1997 at the gamma irradiation facility [2],[3]. In summer 2002, a BOS monitored drift-tube chamber - one of the largest drift-tube chambers in the muon spectrometer - was operated in the gamma irradiation facility. The chamber was equipped with read-out electronics using a prototype version with close to final TDC chips, but adopting a preamplifier and shaping scheme different from the final one. The measurements focussed on the test of the electronics at a high level of gamma irradiation. For that purpose, the spatial resolution and the efficiency of the drift tubes in the chamber were studied at different working points of the chamber under different irradiation conditions.

## 2 Background-Photon Count-Rate in the ATLAS Muon Spectrometer

During the operation of the ATLAS detector, a large number of photons will be created in interactions of the final-state hadrons with the calorimeters, the shielding around the beam pipe and other machine elements. The expected count rates of the background photons in the monitored drift-tube chambers (including a safety factor of 5) are given in Figure 1 for different parts of the muon spectrometer. The highest count rates are expected in the endcap region of the spectrometer. Rates ranging from 40 to 100 s\({}^{-1}\)cm\({}^{-2}\) with a maximum in the middle station are predicted. The irradiation is less in the barrel spectrometer, 8 to 10 s\({}^{-1}\)cm\({}^{-2}\) in the two outer stations and up to 50 s\({}^{-1}\)cm\({}^{-2}\) in the inner station.

## 3 Experimental Set-up

A monitored drift-tube chamber of type BOS was installed in the gamma irradiation facility at CERN for the investigation of the chamber performance (see Figure 2). The chamber was at 4 m distance from the radioactive source with the drift tube oriented vertically. If not stated otherwise in the article, the chamber was operated with Ar:CO\({}_{2}\)(93:7) gas mixture at 3 bar and a voltage of 3080 V, which corresponds to a gas gain of 2 \(\cdot 10^{4}\).

A telescope consisting of four silicon strip detectors was placed 50 cm in front of the chamber. Each strip detector measured the lateral positions of the incident muons with an accuracy of 12 \(\mu\)m. The two outermost detectors measured the vertical positions of the muon hits with the same accuracy, in addition. The active area of the silicon detector is 5\(\times\)5 cm\({}^{2}\).

The beam telescope was enclosed by two fast scintillation counters of the same active area. A coincidence of these two counters with a 10\(\times\)10 cm\({}^{2}\) scintillation counter protected from the photon source upstream in the beam provided the trigger signal for the data acquisition. Because of the high time resolution of less than 200 ps, the time jitter of the trigger time was negligible with respect

to the time resolution of the drift tubes, which is about 3 ns. The merit of the silicon telescope is that it allows the accurate reconstruction of the muon trajectory independently of the hits registered by the drift-tube chamber.

Since the active area of the silicon telescope is small, only 24 drift tubes on each triple layer of the muon chamber were read out. A preliminary version of the chamber read-out electronics was used. This so-called light version of the electronics uses a prototype version of the final TDC chip, but an amplifier and shaper different from the final version. While the final shaping will be bipolar, the preliminary shaper was unipolar without baseline restoration.

In order to prevent a ground loop which could cause pick-up of electromagnetic signals from the outside, the high-voltage and read-out ground were decoupled using the circuit sketched in Figure 3.

## 4 Chamber Read-out

Before describing the resolution and efficiency measurements, we have to report on problems we encountered with the preliminary read-out system, which had to be used in the 2002 test-beam measurements. Two read-out problems occurred: hang-ups of the chamber service module (CSM), the VME module reading out the drift-tube electronics on the chamber, and a timing problem.

A CSM hang-up is a short term for the event that the CSM stays busy with reading out the on-chamber electronics after it has received a trigger. In this case, the CSM has to be reset and the event is lost. CSM hang-ups were the more frequent the higher the level of irradiation, as can be seen in Table 1. Such CSM hang-ups are unacceptable during the operation of the ATLAS experiment. A hang-up rate of 3\(\cdot 10^{-3}\) per BOS chamber would already lead to a loss of \(1-(1-3\cdot 10^{-3})^{88}=23\%\) of the events, as 88 BOS chambers will be installed in the ATLAS detector.

The present understanding of the hang-up problem is that the clock of the TDC chip gets out of phase with the CSM clock. This problem is not expected to reoccur in the final version of the electronics because of an improved phase-lock loop, the circuit in the TDC chip preventing the TDC clock and CSM clock from getting out of phase [4].

Figure 3: The circuit of the splitter box.

The second problem, the timing problem, which we encountered, seems to be related to the problem of the clock synchronization. If one histograms the drift times of a tube crossed by the muons at fixed impact radius - like in Figure 4 -, one obtains a distribution with two maxima, a large one and a small one, if the hang-up rate is high. The two peaks are separated by 25 ns which corresponds to one clock cycle of the TDC and CSM. Their clocks get sometimes out of phase by one clock cycle.

## 5 Resolution Measurements

In the following, we only analyse events with no CSM hang-ups.

We first use the muon trajectories reconstructed from the hits in the silicon telescope. The knowledge of the muon trajectory allows us to calculate its distances \(r_{STEL}\) from the anode wires of the tubes which are hit by the muon and to associate them with the drift times measured by the tubes. We take the

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{c|c|c} Irradiation & Irradiation & Hang-up probability \\ in rate per cm\({}^{2}\) & in rate per tube & \\ \hline none & none & \(7\cdot 10^{-4}\) \\
63 Hz & 73 kHz & \(3\cdot 10^{-3}\) \\
121 Hz & 138 kHz & \(7\cdot 10^{-3}\) \\
183 Hz & 209 kHz & \(1\cdot 10^{-2}\) \\ \end{tabular}
\end{table}

most frequent drift time of the drift-time distribution at fixed impact radius \(r_{STEL}\) as the time \(t\) corresponding to that radius.

After the determination of the space-to-drift-time relationship, we histogram \(r(t)-r_{STEL}\) for \(r_{STEL}\in[\frac{r}{2}-0.5\) mm, \(\frac{r}{2}+0.5\) mm] (\(r\in\{0.5\) mm, \(1.5\) mm,..., \(14.5\) mm\(\}\)) - \(r(t)\) being the drift radius measured by a drift tube. We fit Gaussian distributions to these histograms and take their standard deviation as the spatial resolution of a single tube.

### Resolution Curves at Low Background Rate

We first study the resolution curves which are obtained at low background rate, i.e. when the chamber is not irradiated. The resolution curves for different thresholds - 47 mV, 60 mV, and 77 mV - are shown in Figure 5. All three curves show the same behaviour: the resolution is worst, about 200 \(\mu\)m, for hits close to the wire and best, less than 60 \(\mu\)m, for hits far from the wire. The resolution improves with decreasing threshold. For the time jitter of the logical signal at the output of the discriminator is reduced if the threshold is lowered. As the drift velocity in the vicinity of the anode wire is approximately 0.046 mm ns\({}^{-1}\), a difference in spatial resolution of 15 \(\mu\)m there corresponds to a difference in time jitter of 0.3 ns. If the difference in time jitter were the same for hits close to the tube wall, a difference in spatial resolution of the order of 5 \(\mu\)m should be observed there, because the drift velocity is only about 0.015 mm ns\({}^{-1}\). The measured resolution difference, however, is much

Figure 5: Spatial resolution of the drift tubes for different discriminator thresholds.

less, roughly 1 \(\mu\)m, which can be explained by the fact that the rise time of the analog signal is smaller for hits far from the anode wire than for hits close to the wire and the smaller rise time translates into a smaller time jitter. For further details on the shape of the resolution curves see references [5] and [6].

We compared the resolution curves with the curve obtained in earlier test beam measurements with the BNL prototype electronics at a threshold corresponding to the 25th primary ionization electron [7]. Our 47 mV resolution curve matches the curve obtained with the BNL electronics. This is surprising on first sight, since the 60 mV threshold was assumed to correspond to the 20th primary ionization electron. Recently, the developers of the electronics have found that the threshold effective at the input of the discriminator is roughly 20 mV higher than the nominal threshold setting which explains our results.

### Resolution Curves at High Background Rate

The spatial resolution for different levels of irradiation was studied with the so far nominal threshold of 60 mV. Our results are summarized in Figure 6. The resolution is degraded, when the drift-tube chamber is irradiated. The degradation increases at great drift radii and with the increasing irradiation. The origin of this behaviour is the space-charge effect. When a photon is converted into an electron causing a hit in a drift tube, positive ions are drifting from the avalanche region around the wire towards the tube wall. These ions

Figure 6: Resolution curves for different levels of irradiation at 60 mV threshold.

change the electric field inside the tube and, hence, the drift velocity. If the irradiation is low, the muon hits in the tubes rarely overlap in time with the positive ions from the photon conversion drifting to the tube walls. For high irradiation levels, however, the probability increases that muons hit the tubes when ions from photon hits are still present. Depending on whether the ions are present or not, different space-to-drift-time relationships hold. Yet, in the off-line analysis, only one space-to-drift-time relationship common to all events can be used so that the fluctuation in the space-to-drift-time relationship leads to a decreased spatial resolution. The degradation will be worse if the impact radius of the hit is large because, there, the fluctuation in drift velocity translates into a larger fluctuation in the signal time.

A similar result is obtained at 47 mV threshold (see Figure 7). Because of the reduced threshold, the spatial resolution for hits close to the wire is improved compared to the case of 60 mV threshold.

To summarize the spatial resolution in a single number, we use the _average single-tube resolution_ defined as

\[\vec{\sigma}:=\sqrt{\frac{1}{14.6\ \mathrm{mm}}\int\limits_{0}^{14.6\ \mathrm{mm}} \sigma^{2}(r)\,dr}\]

where \(\sigma(r)\) denotes the spatial resolution at radius \(r\). The dependence of this quantity on the irradiation level is shown in Figure 8. An average single-tube resolution ranging from 104 \(\mu\)m to 115 \(\mu\)m would be achieved in the muon

Figure 7: Resolution curves for different levels of irradiation at 47 mV threshold.

spectrometer for background rates of up to 100 s\({}^{-1}\) cm\({}^{2}\), if the chamber were read out with 60 mV threshold. If the threshold could be reduced to 47 mV, the single-tube resolutions would be improved by 5 \(\mu\)m.

## 6 Comment on the Operating Point

The spatial resolution can be most effectively improved by increasing the gas gain (which means by raising the operating voltage). The single-tube resolution is indeed 17 \(\mu\)m better at twice the gas gain, if the chamber is not irradiated, as can be seen in Figure 9. It is only 11 \(\mu\)m better, if the chamber is irradiated with rates of 121 s\({}^{-1}\)cm\({}^{-2}\) and 183 s\({}^{-1}\)cm\({}^{-2}\), respectively. For the higher gas gain implies a larger space-charge effect, since more ions are created in the avalanche process at the wire. At large radii, the spatial resolution is worse at 4\(\cdot\)10\({}^{4}\) gas gain than at 2\(\cdot\)10\({}^{4}\) because the space-charge effect is dominating at great radii.

At high irradiation, it may even be advantageous to lower the gas gain below 2\(\cdot\)10\({}^{4}\) in order to reduce the resolution degradation caused by the space-charge effect.

## 7 Efficiency Measurements

### Single-Tube Efficiencies

We distinguish two kinds of efficiencies. The first one, called _single-tube efficiency_\(\epsilon\), tells us how frequently a tube detects a hit when its gas volume is traversed by a muon. The second, called _3\(\sigma\)-single-tube efficiency_\(\epsilon_{3\sigma}\), also takes into account whether the correct drift radius has been measured. In this case, hits are accepted if the drift radius \(r\) measured by the tube does not deviate from the distance \(r_{STEL}\) of the muon trajectory from the anode by more than \(3\cdot\sigma(r_{STEL})\) where \(\sigma(r_{STEL})\) is the spatial resolution of the tube at \(r_{STEL}\). For the measurement of the 3\(\sigma\)-single-tube efficiency, the silicon telescope as external reference is useful. The efficiencies, which will be presented in this note, were determined at nominal operating parameters, i.e. \(2\cdot 10^{4}\) gas gain and 60 mV threshold.

Table 2 contains the single-tube efficiencies obtained at different levels of irradiation. In all cases, the single-tube efficiency is very close to 1 and almost independent of the level of irradiation. The tiny, but statistically significant

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{c|c|c} Irradiation & Irradiation & Efficiency \(\epsilon\) \\ in rate per cm\({}^{2}\) & in rate per tube & \\ \hline none & none & 0.9970\(\pm\)0.0002 \\
63 Hz & 73 kHz & 0.9962\(\pm\)0.0002 \\
121 Hz & 138 kHz & 0.9960\(\pm\)0.0002 \\
183 Hz & 209 kHz & 0.9955\(\pm\)0.0003 \\ \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 2: Single-tube efficiencies \(\epsilon\) as a function of the irradiation rate.

Figure 9: Spatial resolutions for gas gains of \(2\cdot 10^{4}\) (solid line) and \(4\cdot 10^{4}\) (dashed line).

efficiency drop of \((1.5\pm 0.4)\cdot 10^{-3}\), which is observed at the rate 209 k Hz a tube, has the following origin. If converted photons trigger a pulse of high amplitude and great width in a tube, the pulse may be above the discriminator threshold during the entire 1.6 \(\mu\)s in which tube hits are accepted after the main trigger from the data acquisition system. If this is the case, no other tube hit will be detected in this period. Since this is a rare case, the single-tube efficiency is almost independent of the level of irradiation.

Fig. 10. \(3\sigma\)-single-tube efficiency \(\epsilon_{3\sigma}\) as a function of the level of irradiation.

While it does not matter for the single-tube efficiency whether the hit detected by the tube is caused by a background photon or the traversing muon, it matters for the \(3\sigma\)-single-tube efficiency. If the background hit leads to a hit time which is much smaller than the drift time corresponding to the impact radius of the incoming muon, one reconstructs the wrong drift radius. How often this happens depends on the background-photon count-rate and the position of the 1.6 \(\mu\)s time window with respect to the drift time \(t(0)\) for \(r_{STEL}=0\). The latter was adjusted such that it starts 80 ns before \(t(0)\). The result of our efficiency measurement is depicted in Figure 10. The \(3\sigma\)-single-tube efficiency drops from 93% without irradiation and to 82% for 209 kHz irradiation rate a tube. This result can be understood by the following simple argument. A background hit occurs before the muon hit; the size of the time interval, into which it has to fall, is about 80 ns\(+\frac{1}{2}\):(maximum drift time)\(\approx\)430 ns; 430 ns multiplied by 209 kHz background rate gives 9% which is close to the measured efficiency degradation of 11%.

The \(3\sigma\)-single-tube efficiency is only 93%, not 100%, if the chamber is not irradiated, because \(\delta\)-electrons which are created when muons cross the tube walls can traverse the gas volume of a drift tube at a smaller distance from the anode wire than the muon, hence causing an earlier hit with a wrong drift radius.

### Tracking Efficiencies

One can deduce the maximum achievable tracking efficiency from the \(3\sigma\)-single-tube efficiency. If we assume that the track reconstruction algorithm is able to separate all wrong hits from correct hits, the track reconstruction efficiency can be calculated from the \(3\sigma\)-single-tube efficiency by simple combinatorics. If the track has to be reconstructed from at least \(k\) correct hits, the tracking efficiency equals

\[\sum_{l=k}^{6}\left(\begin{array}{c}6\\ l\end{array}\right)\,\epsilon_{3\sigma}^{l}\,\cdot\,(1-\epsilon_{3\sigma})^{6-l}\]

(assuming that the muon crossed six tubes of the chamber). The tracking efficiencies for \(k=3,4,5,6\) are shown as a function of the irradiation in Figure 11. For \(k=4\), almost all the tracks should already be found, even at the highest background rate of \(209\) kHz a tube. For \(k=3\), the tracking efficiency is always close to 1.

We conclude that efficient track reconstruction is possible at the background count rates which will be met in the ATLAS experiment.

Comment on the Operation at Lower Gas Pressure

During the operation of the ATLAS muon spectrometer, the exceptional case may occur that one has to operate the monitored drift-tube chambers at atmospheric pressure. It was realized early that, in this case, the gas mixture has to be changed to Ar:CO\({}_{2}\)(80:20) in order to guarantee for enough quenching [8]. The maximum drift time is about 800 ns, then. It was also discovered that, at 2\(\cdot\)10\({}^{4}\) gas gain, the spatial resolution of the drift tubes will be degraded compared to the operation at 3 bar, as the lower gas density implies a smaller number of primary ionization electrons, hence smaller pulse heights. To compensate for this effect, one can increase the gas gain by a factor 3 without changing the charge accumulated on the wire. Our results shown in the left column of Figure 12 confirm the previous findings.

We went a step further and operated the chamber with Ar:CO\({}_{2}\)(80:20) at 1 bar under irradiation. The right column of Figure 12 contains our measurements. Not only is the resolution obtained at 1 bar pressure worse than at 3 bar at 2\(\cdot\)10\({}^{4}\), but also at 6\(\cdot\)10\({}^{4}\) gas gain due to the enhanced space-charge effect. There seems to be no suitable operating point at 1 bar where the resolution achieved with higher gas density at 3 bar could be recuperated.

Summary

We performed resolution and efficiency measurements with a monitored drift-tube-chamber of type BOS and a silicon telescope as external reference in a 100 GeV muon beam at different levels of photon irradiation in the gamma irradiation facility at CERN. The results are consistent with previous measurements published in [2] and [3]. We showed that the nominal threshold setting of the preliminary drift-tube electronics is too high compared to the design goals and should be lowered by at least 15 mV in order to obtain the design resolution of a drift tube. Our measurements show that the average single-drift resolution will be degraded by 10 \(\mu\)m at most under the photon irradiation rates in the ATLAS experiment. The average single-tube resolutions which will be achieved in different regions of the ATLAS muon spectrometer are summarized in Figure 13. While the tube efficiency will not be altered by the irradiation, the probability of an incorrect measurement of an impact radius will go up by 5% at most. Efficient track reconstruction will still be possible under these circumstances. At atmospheric pressure, no suitable operating points of the drift tube where the position resolution is not significantly diminished under background irradiation was found.
