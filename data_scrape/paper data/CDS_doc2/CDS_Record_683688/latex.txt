_LIP and Univ. Lisbon, Portugal_Introduction

The Barrel Module 0 tested in 1998, was re-equipped in one half with Bicron fibres and in the other half with Pol.Hi.Tech fibres.

The Bicron samples produced in 1997 to test the light output, attenuation length and direct response to particles as a function of UVA concentration were not conclusive, so a choice was made based on the results obtained with older samples.

The amount of UVA of the Y11(200)MS Kuraray fibres used since 1995 in the TILECAL prototypes and Modules 0, was observed to be to high. The response of the 95 prototypes in the crack region to pions was about 5% below the average response along the cells, in this way, it was allowed that the Bicron fibres could have a higher \(electron/scintillator\) ratio than the Y11(200)MS Kuraray fibres with 600 ppm of UVA, with a light output (\(x=170\) cm) about 10% lower than the Y11(200)MS (note to be published [1]).

## 2 Results

The **BCF99-28 K MC**, are double cladding fibres with 60 ppm of UVA, corresponding to the request based on [1]. Due to a production problem, Bicron only produced \(\sim\)600 fibres of this type, in order to not compromise the schedule of the instrumentation of the Module 0, it was chosen to produce _standard_**BCF91A MC** double cladding fibres without UVA. The Pol.Hi.Tech **S250** fibres have double cladding, and a certain amount of UVA not specified.

Kuraray **Y11(200)MS** fibres from the 1995 production were also measured for comparison. All fibres were polished in a cutting machine, and the opposite side was painted black.

Table 1 shows the number and length of each type of fibres, the attenuation length (\(L_{att}\))1, the light output at \(x=180\) cm from the readout PM, and the ratio of the light output at 180 cm between each fibre type and the Y11(200)MS (taken as a reference sample). The values are the average over the number of fibres of each type, and in parenthesis is shown the \(RMS\) for each sample.

Footnote 1: The attenuation length is taken from 1 exponential fit to the light output between 70 cm and 180 cm for the Y11(200)MS, S250 and BCF91A MC fibres, and between 70 cm and 210 cm for the BCF99-28 K MC fibres.

Figure 1 shows the light output as a function of distance to the readout PMT, for each fibre type, and figure 2 shows the ratio of light output between each fibre type and the Y11(200)MS fibres.

It can be seen that the BCF99-28 K MC fibres have an attenuation length about 35 cm lower than the BCF91A MC, this is translated in that the light output at \(x=\)180 cm is about 4% lower for the Bicron fibres with UVA. This can be due to the fact that the BCF99-28 K MC have UVA and/or the double of the percentage of WLS dopant (see [2]).

The BCF91A MC have both attenuation length and light output values close to the Y11(200)MS fibres. It should be stated that the Y11(200)MS fibres from the 1995 production, were the best fibres that where used in the TILECAL prototypes and Modules 0.

The S250 fibres have a light output similar to the Y11(200)MS fibres. The attenuation length is about 30 cm higher for the S250 fibres than for the Y11(200)MS fibres.

## 3 Conclusions

The Bicron and Pol.Hi.Tech fibres from the 1998 production which were used to re-equip the Barrel Module 0 in 1998, have optical properties similar to the best Kuraray Y11(200)MS fibres (95 prototypes). One should notice that:

* Bicron had difficulties in producing fibres with UVA (BCF99-28 K MC).
* The BCF91A MC fibres were not yet tested directly with a radiation source, but are expected to give a high light yield, based on previous results [3]. This can lead to a slightly higher response in the crack region between modules of the calorimeter.

The fluctuations of Bicron fibres are studied in another note [4].
