Measurements of 400 \(\mu\)m Metalba tubes

A dimensional control of 4.0 m long aluminium tubes produced by Metalba (Italy) and delivered to Pavia was performed by the CERN metrology service.

As shown below, the measured tubes are well within specifications:

\begin{tabular}{|c c c|} \hline  & **Specification** & **Measured** \\ \hline Outer tube diameter (mm) & 30.0 +0/-0.030 & 29.988 +/- 0.003 \\ Wall thickness (mm) & 0.400 +/- 0.020 & 0.405 +/- 0.006 \\ \hline \end{tabular}

The measurement procedure follows the one described in Section 2 of the internal ATLAS note MUON-NO-091 from 8 September 1995.

Seven tube pieces of 200 mm length were mounted vertically and measured at eight points around their circumference at 50 and 100 mm distance from one of their ends.The tubes were cut with the help of a bandsaw, without any other precautions not to deform the tubes.

The results of these measurements are shown in Figs. 1 - 3 and Tables 1 a and b. The inner and outer tube diameters given are the values for perfect circles fitted to the eight measurements around the tube circumference. The average values are: 29.178 +/-0.002 mm and 29.988 +/-0.003 mm, respectively. The uncertainties are rms values.

The maximum deviation from roundness is defined as the largest distance of any of the eight measured values from the fitted circle. Its average value is 0.012 mm with a maximum of 0.018 mm. Given the fact that no care has been taken to avoid deformations of the tubes when cutting off the 200 mm pieces, these values could be taken as maximum values for possible ovalities of the tubes.

The wall thickness was determined as the difference between the measured values on the outside and inside of the tube. It has been measured for every tube and distance from the tube end at eight points. The average over all measurements is 0.405 +/- 0.006 mm.
