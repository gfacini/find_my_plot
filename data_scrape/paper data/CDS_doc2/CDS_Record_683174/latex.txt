Here we point on the multiboson physics as the major subject of investigations at future colliders. LEP 2 and Tevatron are investigating three-linear boson interactions now. The direct search of quadri-linear interactions may be done at Next Linear Colliders with laser conversion in \(\gamma\gamma\), and at hadron colliders such as LHC. We propose the parameterization of \(\gamma\gamma\,W^{+}W^{-}\) vertex and point out the most interesting terms.

Introduction

It is a rather trivial statement now that the Standard Model (SM) is in excellent agreement with almost all experimental data [1]. But the SM can't be the final physical picture of the particle World. There are some reasons for the existence of new physics beyond the SM. It does not unite gravity with other interactions. It has 20 arbitrary parameters. It is inconsistent as a quantum field theory (some of its couplings are not asymptotically free). It does not explain CP-violation and distinction of 3 families with light neutrinos or existence only 3 such families. So it is preferable to consider the SM as an effective field theory, which is valid up to some cut-off scale \(\Lambda\).

Moreover, some elements of the SM have not been directly experimentally checked. These are symmetry breaking mechanism and interaction between the gauge bosons. The gauge structure of the SM is completely specified by the \(SU(2)_{L}\times U(1)_{Y}\) gauge group. So the triple and quartic vector boson couplings are the direct consequences of the SM. The detailed experimental study would be an important point in confirmation the local gauge invariance of the SM or in receiving indications on existence of new physics beyond the SM.

What way out of SM framework do we know? Of course, we are interesting only in experimentally tested ones.

* Constructing new theories is the most straightforward way. We have Grand Unifications, which predict at least new leptoquark bosons and corresponding interactions. Supersymmetry gives us a lot of new particles and interactions. Composite models present to us a whole new particle world at new level of reality. All these theories have their own ground and reasons. Existence of new particles is common feature of these theories.
* The modification of known interactions is the other way to go beyond the SM. Historically, introduction the proton formfactors in QED had allowed to explain the electron scattering on nucleon without any new particles, but this lead to discovery of the composite nucleon structure. Later, the underlying theory of quarks had to explain the behavior of such formfactors. But the formfactor itself is independent of underlying theory.
* The another approach to model independent analysis is based on the \(1/\Lambda\) expansion [2]. The SM is treated as effective low energy theory and new interactions (which take place at energy scale \(\Lambda\)) manifest themselves as small additional interactions far below the \(\Lambda\). The single argument against this approach is that new interactions may have no scale parameter \(\Lambda\). But it is another story.

Here we will follow the last two ways. The main subject of this note is electroweak vector boson self-interaction, and its possible role in ATLAS physical program.

The Standard Model gives the precise prediction for the vector boson self-couplings, which dictated by the _nonabelian gauge structure_ of this theory. These self-interactions are trilinear (\(WW\gamma\), \(WWZ\)) and quartic (\(WWWW\), \(WW\gamma\gamma\), \(WWZ\gamma\), \(WWZZ\)).

\[{\cal L}_{\ SM}^{\ (3)} = ig\left\{(W_{\mu\alpha}^{-}W_{\mu}^{+}-W_{\nu}^{-}W_{\nu\alpha}^{+}) W_{\alpha}^{3}+W_{\mu}^{-}W_{\nu}^{+}W_{\mu\nu}^{3}\right\}=\] \[= \sum_{V=\gamma,\,Z}ig_{WW\nu}\Big{\{}(W_{\mu\alpha}^{-}W_{\mu}^{+}-W _{\nu}^{-}W_{\nu\alpha}^{+})V_{\alpha}+W_{\mu}^{-}W_{\nu}^{+}V_{\mu\nu}\Big{\}},\] \[{\cal L}_{\ SM}^{\ (4)} = \frac{g^{2}}{2}\Big{[}W_{\mu}^{-}W_{\nu}^{+}+W_{\nu}^{-}W_{\mu}^{+ }-2(W_{\rho}^{-}W_{\rho}^{+})\delta_{\mu\nu}\Big{]}\times\{W_{\mu}^{-}W_{\nu}^ {+}+W_{\mu}^{3}W_{\nu}^{3}\}=\] \[= \frac{g^{2}}{2}\Big{[}W_{\mu}^{-}W_{\nu}^{+}+W_{\nu}^{-}W_{\mu}^{ +}-2(W_{\rho}^{-}W_{\rho}^{+})\delta_{\mu\nu}\Big{]}\times\] \[\Big{\{}W_{\mu}^{-}W_{\nu}^{+}+s_{W}^{2}A_{\mu}A_{\nu}+2s_{W}c_{W }A_{\mu}Z_{\nu}+c_{W}^{2}Z_{\mu}Z_{\nu}\Big{\}},\]

where \(V_{\mu\nu}=\partial_{\mu}V_{\nu}-\partial_{\nu}V_{\mu}\), \(W_{\mu}^{3}=s_{W}A_{\mu}+c_{W}Z_{\mu}\), \(g_{WW\gamma}=e\), \(g_{WWZ}=e\frac{c_{W}}{s_{W}}\), and \(g=e/s_{W}\).

Direct tests of the triple couplings are provided now by vector boson pair production in \(p\overline{p}\) and \(e^{+}e^{-}\) collisions. The CDF and D0 groups have studied \(W\gamma\), \(WW\), \(WZ\) and \(Z\gamma\) events in \(p\overline{p}\) collisions at \(\sqrt{s}=1.8\) TeV during the Tevatron Run I [3].

What are scales of the total cross-sections for processes with quartic couplings? We compare such cross-sections for \(e^{+}e^{-}\to W^{+}W^{-}\), which is ruled by trilinear interactions, and \(\gamma\gamma\to W^{+}W^{-}\) (see Fig.1.).

The first reaction has a maximal value of order 20 pb at 200 GeV, the second one tends to constant value of order 100 pb. And both reactions have cross-sections larger then \(\sigma(e^{+}e^{-}\rightarrow\mu^{+}\mu^{-})=3pb\). We see that role of pure boson interactions on the future colliders will increase dramatically.

What tools are we need for the investigation of boson interactions? At least we must have parameterization of possible deviations from the SM. In case of trilinear interaction

Figure 1: Comparision of total cross-sections

we have such a parameterization (e.g. see [4]):

\[{\cal L}_{H\,PZH}^{\,(3)}=g_{WWV}\Big{\{}ig_{1}^{V}(W_{\mu\nu}^{-}W_{ \mu}^{+}-W_{\mu}^{-}W_{\mu\nu}^{+})V_{\nu} \tag{3}\] \[+i\,k_{V}W_{\mu}^{-}W_{\nu}^{+}V_{\mu\nu}+\frac{i\,\lambda_{V}}{m_ {W}^{2}}W_{\rho\mu}^{-}W_{\mu\nu}^{+}V_{\nu\rho}\] \[-g_{4}^{V}W_{\mu}^{-}W_{\nu}^{+}(\partial_{\mu}V_{\nu}+\partial_{ \nu}V_{\mu})+g_{5}^{V}\epsilon_{\mu\nu\rho\sigma}(W_{\mu}^{-}\stackrel{{ \leftrightarrow}}{{\partial_{\rho}}}W_{\nu}^{+})V_{\sigma}\] \[+i\widetilde{k}_{V}W_{\mu}^{-}W_{\nu}^{+}\widetilde{V}_{\mu\nu} +\frac{i\widetilde{\lambda}_{V}}{m_{W}^{2}}W_{\rho\mu}^{-}W_{\mu\nu}^{+} \widetilde{V}_{\nu\rho}\Big{\}},\]

\(\widetilde{V}_{\mu\nu}=\frac{1}{2}\epsilon_{\mu\nu\rho\sigma}V_{\rho\sigma}\) and \(g_{1}^{V}=1\) and \(k_{V}=1\) reproduces the SM.

Now running LEP2 will test these vertexes with higher precision then Tevatron has made up to 1996. Now it is evident that only fine tuning gauge cancellation between \(\gamma\), \(Z\), and \(\nu\) exchanges producees the coincidence with the experiment [5].

## 2 Example: Three-linear boson interaction

As an example let's discuss tri-linear weak boson interactions [6].

The differential cross-section for \(e^{+}e^{-}\to W^{+}W^{-}\) is convenient to offer as a sum:

\[\frac{d\sigma}{dt}=\frac{d\sigma_{t}}{dt}+\frac{d\sigma_{st}}{dt}+\frac{d\sigma _{s}}{dt},\]

where \(d\sigma_{t}\) originates from the first diagram with neutrino exchange in \(t\)-channel, \(d\sigma_{s}\) represents two other diagrams with neutral vector boson exchange in \(s\)-channel, and \(d\sigma_{st}\) gives us interference terms. They have the form:

\[\frac{d\sigma_{t}}{dt} = \frac{\pi\,\alpha^{2}}{2s^{2}}\,\frac{g^{4}}{4\,e^{4}}\Bigg{\{}2 \frac{s}{M^{2}}+2\frac{ut-M^{4}}{s^{2}}\Big{[}\frac{s^{2}}{t^{2}}+\frac{s^{2}} {4\,M^{4}}\Big{]}\Bigg{\}}, \tag{4}\] \[\frac{d\sigma_{st}}{dt} = \frac{\pi\,\alpha^{2}}{2s^{2}}\,\frac{g^{2}}{4\,e^{2}}\Big{\{}f_ {1}\frac{ut-M^{4}}{s^{2}}(4\,\frac{s}{t}+2\frac{s}{M^{2}}+\frac{s^{2}}{M^{4}} \,)\] \[+f_{2}[\frac{ut-M^{4}}{s^{2}}-4+2\frac{s}{M^{2}}+4\,\frac{M^{2}}{ t}]\] \[+f_{3}\frac{ut-M^{4}}{s\,{\rm M}^{2}}[-2\frac{s}{t}-\frac{s^{2}}{2 M^{4}}]\] \[+f_{5}[4\frac{ut-M^{4}}{tM^{2}}(1-2\frac{s}{M^{2}})+8\frac{s}{M^{2 }}-2\frac{s^{2}}{M^{4}}]\Bigg{\}},\] \[\frac{d\sigma_{s}}{dt} = \frac{\pi\,\alpha^{2}}{2s^{2}}\,\Big{\{}4\,\frac{ut-M^{4}}{s^{2}} \,\Big{[}F_{1}(3-\frac{s}{M^{2}}+\frac{s^{2}}{4\,M^{4}})+F_{2}\frac{s(s-2M^{2} )}{4\,M^{4}}\] \[+F_{12}\frac{s(s-2M^{2})}{2M^{4}}+F_{3}\frac{s^{4}}{16M^{8}}V^{2}\] \[+F_{13}\frac{s^{2}(s-2M^{2})}{4\,M^{6}}(-V^{2})+F_{23}(-\frac{s^{ 3}}{4\,M^{6}}V^{2})\] \[+F_{6}(-\frac{s}{2M^{2}})+F_{7}2\frac{s^{2}}{M^{4}}V^{2}+F_{67}(-4 \frac{s}{M^{2}})\]\[+F_{4}(-\frac{s^{3}}{2M^{6}})+F_{5}(-\frac{s^{3}V^{2}}{2M^{6}})\Big{]}\] \[+F_{2}\frac{s}{M^{2}}V^{2}+F_{4}\frac{s^{3}}{M^{6}}V^{2}+F_{5}\frac {s^{3}}{M^{6}}V^{4}+F_{6}\frac{s}{M^{2}}+\] \[+4\frac{s^{2}}{M^{4}}\frac{t-M^{2}+s/2}{s}[\tilde{F}_{25}V^{2}+ \tilde{F}_{46}]\Big{\}},\]

where \(V=(1-4\,M^{2}/s)^{1/2}\) is the velocity of the final bosons in the center of mass frame, and the formfactors appear in cross-section as following combinations

\[f_{i} = Q_{e}Q_{w}G_{i}^{\gamma}+(1+\eta_{e})\chi G_{i}^{z};\] \[F_{ij} = Q_{e}^{2}Q_{w}^{2}\,G_{i}^{\gamma}G_{j}^{\gamma}+Q_{e}Q_{w}\eta_ {e}\chi(G_{i}^{\gamma}G_{j}^{z}+G_{i}^{z}G_{j}^{\gamma})+(1+\eta_{e}^{2})\chi ^{2}\,G_{i}^{z}G_{j}^{z};\] \[\tilde{F}_{ij} = Q_{e}Q_{w}\chi(G_{i}^{\gamma}G_{j}^{z}+G_{i}^{z}G_{j}^{\gamma})+ 2\eta_{e}\chi^{2}G_{i}^{z}G_{j}^{z},\quad F_{i}=F_{ii},\]

here \(V=(1-4\,M^{2}/s)^{1/2}\), \(\chi=\omega_{e}\omega_{w}s/(s-M_{z}^{2})\), and \(i=1,...,7\). The formfactors here are redefined:

\[G_{1}=g_{1}+\lambda;\quad G_{2}=g_{1}+k+\lambda;\quad G_{3}=-\lambda;\]

\[G_{4}=ig_{4}s/M^{2};\quad G_{5}=ig_{5}s/M^{2};\quad G_{6}=-i\tilde{k};\quad G _{7}=i\tilde{\lambda}.\]

These formulae can be rewritten for the case of initial quarks. For the reaction \(d+\vec{d}\) we must substitute the lepton constants by the quarks' ones (\(Q_{e}\to Q_{d},\omega_{e}\rightarrow\omega_{d},\eta_{e}\rightarrow\eta_{d}\)). For the reaction \(u+\vec{u}\) we have to change the constants but must use the modification of kinematical variables also in the \(d\sigma_{st}\) and \(d\sigma_{s}\) (\(u\leftrightarrow t\)).

The total cross-section also is written as a sum of three terms:

\[\sigma=\sigma_{t}+\sigma_{st}+\sigma_{s}.\]

Introducing the notations \(L=\frac{1}{V}\ln\frac{1+V}{1-V}\) and \(y=s/4\,M^{2}\) we get:

\[\sigma_{t} = \frac{\pi\,\alpha^{2}V}{2s}\frac{g^{4}}{4e^{4}}\Bigg{\{}-4+\frac {20}{3}y+\frac{4}{3}y^{2}+4\frac{2y-1}{2y}L\Bigg{\}}, \tag{5}\] \[\sigma_{st} = \frac{\pi\,\alpha^{2}V}{2s}\frac{g^{2}}{4e^{2}}\Bigg{\{}f_{1} \big{(}\frac{1}{y}-\frac{10}{3}-\frac{4}{3}y+\frac{8}{3}y^{2}+\frac{1}{2y}2L \big{)}\] \[\qquad+f_{2}(-4+\frac{16}{3}y+\frac{8}{3}y^{2}-\frac{2}{y}L)\] \[\qquad+f_{3}(-2+4y+\frac{16}{3}y^{2}-\frac{16}{3}y^{3}-\frac{1}{y }L)\] \[\qquad+f_{5}(4+8y-2\frac{4y-1}{y}L)\bigg{\}},\] \[\sigma_{s} = \frac{\pi\,\alpha^{2}V}{2s}\bigg{\{}F_{1}\frac{2}{3}V^{2}\,(3-4 \,y+4y^{2})+F_{2}\frac{8}{3}V^{2}y\,(y+1)+F_{12}\frac{8}{3}V^{2}y(2y-1)\] \[\qquad+F_{3}\frac{32}{3}V^{6}y^{4}+F_{13}(-\frac{16}{3}V^{4}y^{2} (2y-1))+F_{23}(-\frac{32}{3}V^{4}y^{3})\] \[\qquad+F_{4}\frac{128}{3}V^{2}y^{3}+F_{5}\frac{128}{3}V^{4}y^{3}\] \[\qquad+F_{6}\frac{4}{3}(2y+1)+F_{7}\frac{64}{3}V^{4}y^{2}+F_{6\,7 }(-\frac{32}{3}V^{2}y)\bigg{\}}.\]From the above formulae it is evident that \(CP\)-noninvariant terms (with formfactors \(G_{4}\), \(G_{6}\) and \(G_{7}\)) do not interfere with other terms and appear only as quadratic combinations. So, it is difficult to think that one can see them in experiment in not far time. Among other terms the term with \(G_{5}\) formfactor is one of interest. We can estimate the sensitivity of differential cross-section to it by setting all others to their SM values and calculating the value of \(G_{5}\) which cause 10% deviation of differential cross-section (Fig.2 ). The lines on this figure demonstrate the value of \(G_{5}\) where it gives exactly 10% deviation, in the outer areas of the curves the deviation larger, and in more close to zero the deviation small.

So one can see that \(G_{5}\) may be constrained to the value \(\sim 0.1-0.2\) by not very difficult experiment.

## 3 Quadrilinear or quartic interaction for \(\gamma\gamma WW\), general parameterization

Let us consider now the production of \(W^{+}\) and \(W^{-}\) with polarization vectors (momentums) \(\xi_{1}(p_{1})\) and \(\xi_{2}(p_{2})\) by two \(\gamma\) with vectors \(e_{1}(k_{1})\) and \(e_{2}(k_{2})\). The corresponding matrix element may be written as

\[{\cal M}(\gamma\gamma\to W^{+}W^{-})=e_{1\mu}e_{2\nu}R_{\mu\nu\rho\sigma}\xi_{1 \rho}\xi_{2\sigma}\,. \tag{6}\]

Our task is to determine the structure of \(R_{\mu\nu\rho\sigma}\). It is convenient to replace the initial set of momentums \((k_{1},\,k_{2},\,p_{1},\,p_{2})\) by another set, taking into account the conservation law \(k_{1}+k_{2}=p_{1}+p_{2}\) and mass-shell equations \(k_{1}^{2}=k_{2}^{2}=0\), \(p_{1}^{2}=p_{2}^{2}=M^{2}\):

\[K=k_{1}+k_{2}=p_{1}+p_{2},\]

Figure 2: Sensitivity of differential cross-section to \(G_{5}\) formfactor

\[Q=k_{1}-k_{2},\] \[P=p_{1}-p_{2},\] \[\Pi{=}\ P-\frac{PQ}{Q^{2}}Q,\] \[N_{\mu}=i\,\epsilon_{\mu\nu\rho\sigma}\,P_{\nu}K_{\rho}Q_{\sigma}.\]

\[\begin{array}{c|cccc}&K&Q&P&\Pi&N\\ \hline K&K^{2}&0&0&0&0\\ Q&0&-K^{2}&QP&0&0\\ P&0&QP&-K^{2}-4\,M^{2}&\Pi^{2}&0\\ \Pi&0&0&\Pi^{2}&\Pi^{2}&0\\ N&0&0&0&0&K^{2}\,\Pi^{2}\end{array}. \tag{7}\]

So, we may choose the orthogonal set of vectors \((K,Q,\Pi,N)=(\eta^{1},\eta^{2},\eta^{3},\eta^{4})\) as a new basis and rewrite (6) :

\[R_{\mu\nu\rho\sigma}=\sum_{i,j,k,l=1}^{4}r_{jkl}\eta^{i}_{\mu}\eta^{j}_{\nu} \eta^{k}_{\rho}\eta^{l}_{\sigma}=\]

\[=(\sum_{i,j=1}^{4}\eta^{i}_{\mu}\eta^{j}_{\nu}C_{ij})(\sum_{k,l=1}^{4}\eta^{k} _{\rho}\eta^{l}_{\sigma}D_{k\,l})=\Phi_{\mu\nu}\Psi_{\rho\sigma},\]

Vertex depends only from two variables \(K^{2}=-s\) and \(QP=t-u\).

The electromagnetic gauge invariance results in the equations: \(k_{1\mu}\,\Phi_{\mu\nu}=0\) and \(k_{2\nu}\Phi_{\mu\nu}=0\). The equation \(k_{1\mu}\,\Phi_{\mu\nu}=(1/2)(\eta^{1}_{\mu}+\eta^{2}_{\mu})\sum_{i,j}\eta^{i} _{\mu}\eta^{j}_{\nu}C_{ij}=0\) gives us \(C_{1j}=C_{2j}\). The other equation \(k_{2\nu}\Phi_{\mu\nu}=(1/2)(\eta^{1}_{\mu}-\eta^{2}_{\mu})\sum_{i,j}\eta^{i} _{\mu}\eta^{j}_{\nu}C_{ij}=0\) gives \(C_{i1}=-C_{i2}\).

\[\Phi_{\mu\nu}=\Phi_{1}\Pi_{\mu}\,\Pi_{\nu}+\Phi_{2}N_{\mu}N_{\nu}+\Phi_{3}(\Pi _{\mu}\,N_{\nu}-N_{\mu}\,\Pi_{\nu})+\Phi_{4}(\Pi_{\mu}N_{\nu}+N_{\mu}\,\Pi_{ \nu}).\]

The Bose-symmetry (i.e. invariance under exchange \((k_{1},e_{1})\leftrightarrow(k_{2},e_{2})\)) leads to \(\Phi_{1}(s,t,u)=\Phi_{1}(s,u,t)\), \(\Phi_{2}(s,t,u)=\Phi_{2}(s,u,t)\), \(\Phi_{3}(s,t,u)=\Phi_{3}(s,u,t)\) and \(\Phi_{4}(s,t,u)=-\Phi_{4}(s,u,t)\). For the case when \(u-\)channel is the same as \(t-\)channel, we have \(\Phi_{4}=0\). This is equivalent to \(C-\) invariance.

\[\Phi_{\mu\nu}=\Phi_{1}\Pi_{\mu}\Pi_{\nu}+\Phi_{2}\,N_{\mu}\,N_{\nu}.+\Phi_{3}( \Pi_{\mu}\,N_{\nu}-N_{\mu}\,\Pi_{\nu}).\]

For massive \(W\) we have Lorentz condition \(p_{\xi}\xi_{i}=0\)\((i=1,2)\)

\[(K+\Pi+\frac{PQ}{Q^{2}}Q)\xi_{1}=0;(K-\Pi-\frac{PQ}{Q^{2}}Q)\xi_{2}=0.\]

That is in \(\Psi_{\mu\nu}=\sum_{k,l=1}^{4}\eta^{k}_{\mu}\eta^{l}_{\nu}D_{k\,l}\), we can express terms with \(D_{1j}\) and \(D_{i1}\) as sum of the others. So, we obtain \(\Psi_{\mu\nu}=\sum_{k,l=2}^{4}\eta^{k}_{\mu}\eta^{l}_{\nu}D_{kl}\), or

\[{\cal M} = \{\Phi_{1}(\Pi e_{1})(\Pi e_{2})+\Phi_{2}(Ne_{1})(Ne_{2})\] \[+\Phi_{3}[(\Pi e_{1})(Ne_{2})-(Ne_{1})(\Pi e_{2})]\] \[+\Phi_{4}[(\Pi e_{1})(Ne_{2})+(Ne_{1})(\Pi e_{2})]\}\times\] \[\times \{\Psi_{1}(Q\xi_{1})(Q\xi_{2})+\Psi_{2}(\Pi\xi_{1})(\Pi\xi_{2})+ \Psi_{3}(N\xi_{1})(N\xi_{2})\] \[+\Psi_{4}[(Q\xi_{1})(\Pi\xi_{2})+(\Pi\xi_{1})(Q\xi_{2})]+\Psi_{7}[ (Q\xi_{1})(\Pi\xi_{2})-(\Pi\xi_{1})(Q\xi_{2})]\] \[+\Psi_{5}[(Q\xi_{1})(N\xi_{2})+(N\xi_{1})(Q\xi_{2})]+\Psi_{8}[(Q \xi_{1})(N\xi_{2})-(N\xi_{1})(Q\xi_{2})]\] \[+\Psi_{6}[(\Pi\xi_{1})(N\xi_{2})+(N\xi_{1})(\Pi\xi_{2})]+\Psi_{9} [(\Pi\xi_{1})(N\xi_{2})-(N\xi_{1})(\Pi\xi_{2})]\}.\]The most general form of matrix element has 36 formfactor structures; this is expected from the consideration on the base of rotation group arguments.

In the case of \(C-\) invariance, we have \(\Phi_{4}=0\), that is 27 structures, and taking into account \(P-\)invariance we obtain only 18 terms.

So we have general parameterization of quadrilinear interaction, but it is difficult to separate from the above formula the SM terms or to divide the rest terms according to their importance.

Therefore, we have to try the other way.

## 4 Multiboson interactions in \(1/\Lambda^{2}\) order

For energies \(E\) (\(\Lambda>E>M_{W}\), where \(\Lambda>>M_{W}\)) we can write down the next expansion for the Lagrangian

\[{\cal L}_{eff}={\cal L}_{0}+\frac{1}{\Lambda}{\cal L}_{1}+\frac{1}{\Lambda^{2} }{\cal L}_{2}+\cdots,\]

where \({\cal L}_{0}={\cal L}_{SM}\) and \({\cal L}_{i}\) are \(G_{SM}=SU(3)\times SU(2)\times U(1)\)-invariant. We consider the part, which includes only electroweak bosons.

**I.**

First class of effective Lagrangians is built from vector boson field strengths \({\cal W}^{i}_{\mu\nu}=W^{i}_{\mu\nu}+g\,\epsilon_{ijk}\,W^{j}_{\mu}W^{k}_{\nu}\) and \(B_{\mu\nu}=\partial_{\mu}B_{\nu}-\partial_{\nu}B_{\mu}\) to ensure \(SU(2)\) and \(U(1)\) invariance:

\[{\cal L}_{\,W} = \frac{\alpha_{W}}{\Lambda^{2}}\varepsilon_{ijk}{\cal W}^{i}_{ \mu\nu}{\cal W}^{j}_{\nu\lambda}{\cal W}^{k}_{\lambda\mu}\,=\,6i\frac{\alpha_{ W}}{\Lambda^{2}}W^{-}_{\mu\sigma}\,W^{+}_{\sigma\nu}W^{3}_{\mu\nu}\,+{\cal L}^{(4)}_{W}+{ \cal L}^{(5)}_{W}+{\cal L}^{(6)}_{W},\] \[{\cal L}_{\,\widetilde{W}} = \frac{\alpha_{W}}{\Lambda^{2}}\varepsilon_{ijk}\widetilde{\cal W }^{i}_{\mu\nu}{\cal W}^{j}_{\nu\lambda}{\cal W}^{k}_{\lambda\mu}\,=-6i\frac{ \alpha_{W}^{\widetilde{W}}}{\Lambda^{2}}W^{-}_{\mu\sigma}W^{+}_{\sigma\nu} \widetilde{W}^{3}_{\mu\nu}\,+{\cal L}^{(4)}_{\,\widetilde{W}}+{\cal L}^{(5)} _{\,\widetilde{W}}+{\cal L}^{(6)}_{\,\widetilde{W}},\] \[{\cal L}_{\,B} = \frac{\alpha_{B}}{\Lambda^{2}}B_{\mu\nu}B_{\nu\lambda}B_{\lambda \mu}\,\equiv\,0,\qquad{\cal L}_{\,\widetilde{B}}=\frac{\alpha_{\widetilde{B}} }{\Lambda^{2}}\widetilde{B}_{\mu\nu}B_{\nu\lambda}\,B_{\lambda\mu}\,\equiv \,0,\] \[{\cal L}_{\,BWW}=\frac{\alpha_{BWW}}{\Lambda^{2}}B_{\mu\nu}{\cal W }^{i}_{\mu\sigma}{\cal W}^{i}_{\nu\sigma}\,\equiv\,0,\]

where \({\cal L}^{(n)}\) denotes \(n-\)boson interaction term. The tri-linear part produces

\[\Delta\lambda_{V}=\alpha_{W}\frac{6m_{W}^{2}}{\Lambda^{2}},\qquad\qquad\Delta \widetilde{\lambda}_{V}=\alpha_{\widetilde{W}}\frac{-6m_{W}^{2}}{\Lambda^{2}}.\]

The 4-boson parts of \({\cal L}_{W}\) and \({\cal L}_{\,\widetilde{W}}\) have the forms

\[{\cal L}^{(4)}_{\,W} = \alpha_{W}\frac{6g}{\Lambda^{2}}\Bigl{\{}W^{-}_{\mu}W^{+}_{\nu}[W^ {-}_{\mu\sigma}W^{+}_{\sigma\nu}-W^{-}_{\sigma\mu}W^{+}_{\sigma\mu}]\,+\] \[+ W^{3}_{\rho}W^{3}_{\mu\nu}[W^{-}_{\nu\rho}W^{+}_{\mu}-W^{-}_{\mu }W^{+}_{\rho\nu}]+W^{3}_{\mu}W^{3}_{\mu\nu}[W^{-}_{\rho}W^{+}_{\rho\sigma}-W^{- }_{\nu\rho}W^{+}_{\rho}]\Bigr{\}},\] \[{\cal L}^{(4)}_{\,\widetilde{W}} = \alpha_{\widetilde{W}}\frac{6g}{\Lambda^{2}}\Bigl{\{}W^{-}_{\mu }W^{+}_{\nu}[\widetilde{W}^{-}_{\mu\sigma}W^{+}_{\sigma\nu}-\widetilde{W}^{-} _{\nu\sigma}W^{+}_{\sigma\mu}]\,+\] \[+ W^{3}_{\rho}W^{3}_{\mu\nu}[\widetilde{W}^{-}_{\rho\mu}W^{+}_{\nu }-W^{-}_{\nu}\widetilde{W}^{+}_{\mu\rho}]+W^{3}_{\mu}W^{3}_{\mu\nu}[W^{-}_{ \rho}\widetilde{W}^{+}_{\rho\nu}-\widetilde{W}^{-}_{\nu\rho}W^{+}_{\rho}] \Bigr{\}}.\]

**II.** The other terms are connected with scalar fields.

We take \(<\phi>^{T}=(0,v)\), where \(v\) is the vacuum expectation value of the SM Higgs' field (\(v^{2}g^{2}=2m_{W}^{2}\)). The remaining lagrangians have overall factor \(m_{W}^{2}/\Lambda^{2}\).

**IIa.**

\[{\cal L}_{\phi W}=\frac{\alpha_{\phi W}}{\Lambda^{2}}(\phi^{+}\phi){ \cal W}^{i}_{\mu\nu}\,{\cal W}^{i}_{\mu\nu} \rightarrow {\cal L}^{(2)}_{\phi W}+{\cal L}^{(3)}_{\phi W}+{\cal L}^{(4)}_{ \phi\,W},\] \[{\cal L}_{\phi\,\widetilde{W}}=\frac{\alpha_{\phi\,\widetilde{W}}} {\Lambda^{2}}(\phi^{+}\phi)\widetilde{\cal W}^{i}_{\mu\nu}\,{\cal W}^{i}_{\mu\nu} \rightarrow {\cal L}^{(2)}_{\phi\,\widetilde{W}},\] \[{\cal L}_{\phi\,BW}=\frac{\alpha_{\phi\,BW}}{\Lambda^{2}}(\phi^{ +}\tau_{i}\phi)B_{\mu\nu}\,{\cal W}^{i}_{\mu\nu} \rightarrow {\cal L}^{(2)}_{\phi\,BW}+{\cal L}^{(3)}_{\phi\,BW},\] \[{\cal L}_{\phi\,B\widetilde{W}}=\frac{\alpha_{\phi\,B\widetilde{W }}}{\Lambda^{2}}(\phi^{+}\tau_{i}\phi)B_{\mu\nu}\widetilde{\cal W}^{i}_{\mu\nu} \rightarrow {\cal L}^{(2)}_{\phi\,B\widetilde{W}}+{\cal L}^{(3)}_{\phi\,B \widetilde{W}},\] \[{\cal L}_{\phi\,B}=\frac{\alpha_{\phi\,B}}{\Lambda^{2}}(\phi^{+ }\phi)B_{\mu\nu}B_{\mu\nu} \rightarrow {\cal L}^{(2)}_{\phi\,B},\] \[{\cal L}_{\phi\,\widetilde{B}}=\frac{\alpha_{\phi\,\widetilde{B }}}{\Lambda^{2}}(\phi^{+}\phi)B_{\mu\nu}\widetilde{B}_{\mu\nu} \equiv 0.\]

These Lagrangians include \({\cal L}^{(2)}\) parts, affecting the gauge boson two-point functions at tree level.

Three boson vertex is modified by first four of these operators:

\[\Delta g_{1}^{\gamma,Z};\qquad\Delta k_{\gamma},\quad\Delta k_{Z};\qquad\Delta \widetilde{k}_{\gamma},\qquad\Delta\widetilde{k}_{Z};\]

We see that only \({\cal L}_{\phi W}\) produces quadri-linear interaction term but this term is equal to the SM one with replacement \(\frac{g^{2}}{2}\rightarrow\frac{g^{2}}{2}-\alpha_{\phi W}4\frac{m_{W}^{2}}{ \Lambda^{2}}\) in the coefficient.

**IIb.** Terms with covariant derivatives:

\[{\cal L}_{\phi\,DW}=i\frac{\alpha_{\phi\,DW}}{\Lambda^{2}}(D_{ \mu}\phi)^{+}\tau_{i}(D_{\nu}\phi){\cal W}^{i}_{\mu\nu} \rightarrow {\cal L}^{(3)}_{\phi\,DW}+{\cal L}^{(4)}_{\phi\,DW},\] \[{\cal L}_{\phi\,D\widetilde{W}}=i\frac{\alpha_{\phi\,D\widetilde{W }}}{\Lambda^{2}}(D_{\mu}\phi)^{+}\tau_{i}(D_{\nu}\phi)\widetilde{\cal W}^{i}_{\mu\nu} \rightarrow {\cal L}^{(3)}_{\phi\,D\widetilde{W}},\] \[{\cal L}_{\phi\,DB}=i\frac{\alpha_{\phi\,DB}}{\Lambda^{2}}(D_{\mu }\phi)^{+}(D_{\nu}\phi)B_{\mu\nu} \rightarrow {\cal L}^{(3)}_{\phi\,DB},\] \[{\cal L}_{\phi\,D\widetilde{B}}=i\frac{\alpha_{\phi\,D\widetilde{ B}}}{\Lambda^{2}}(D_{\mu}\phi)^{+}(D_{\nu}\phi)\widetilde{B}_{\mu\nu} \rightarrow {\cal L}^{(3)}_{\phi\,D\widetilde{B}}.\]

The others, in which both derivatives act on one scalar field, we distinguish by prime \((\alpha^{\prime})\).

This subclass also gives similar changes in \({\cal L}^{(3)}\).

\[{\cal L}^{(4)}_{\phi\,DW} = -g\frac{m_{W}^{2}}{\Lambda^{2}}\Big{\{}-(\alpha_{\phi DW}+\alpha^ {\prime}_{\phi\,DW}){\cal L}^{(4)}_{SM}\frac{2}{g^{2}}+\] \[- \alpha_{\phi\,DW}\frac{s_{W}}{c_{W}}\Big{[}W^{-}_{\mu}W^{+}_{\nu}+ W^{-}_{\nu}W^{+}_{\mu}-2(W^{-}_{\rho}W^{+}_{\rho})\delta_{\mu\nu}\Big{]}W^{3}_{ \mu}B_{\nu}\Big{\}}.\]

So the first part can be adopted by the replacement \(\frac{g^{2}}{2}\rightarrow\frac{g^{2}}{2}-g\frac{m_{W}^{2}}{\Lambda^{2}}( \alpha_{\phi\,DW}+\alpha^{\prime}_{\phi\,DW})\) whereas the second part modifies interaction of charged and neutral vector bosons.

**IIc.**

\[{\cal L}_{\phi\,D}=\frac{\alpha_{\phi\,D}}{\Lambda^{2}}(D_{\mu}D_{\nu}\phi)^{+ }(D_{\mu}D_{\nu}\phi)\rightarrow{\cal L}^{(2)}_{\phi\,D}+{\cal L}^{(3)}_{ \phi\,D}+{\cal L}^{(4)}_{\phi\,D},\]

\[{\cal L}^{\prime}_{\phi\,D}=\frac{\alpha^{\prime}_{\phi\,D}}{\Lambda^{2}}(D_{ \mu}D_{\nu}\phi)^{+}(D_{\nu}D_{\mu}\phi)\rightarrow{\cal L}^{\prime\,(2)}_{ \phi\,D}+{\cal L}^{\prime\,(3)}_{\phi\,D}+{\cal L}^{\prime\,(4)}_{\phi\,D},\]

\[{\cal L}_{\widetilde{\phi\,D}}=\frac{\alpha^{\,-\,\sim}_{\phi\,D}}{\Lambda^{2}} \epsilon_{\mu\nu\,\rho\sigma}\,(D_{\mu}D_{\nu}\phi)^{+}(D_{\rho}D_{\sigma}\phi) \rightarrow{\cal L}^{(2)}_{\widetilde{\phi\,D}}+{\cal L}^{(3)}_{\widetilde{ \phi\,D}},\]The most interesting alterations in the quadri-linear interaction are

\[{\cal L}^{(4)}_{\phi D} = \frac{m_{W}^{2}}{\Lambda^{2}}\frac{g^{2}}{8}\Big{\{}\alpha_{\phi D} 4(W^{-}W^{-})(W^{+}W^{+})+\alpha^{\prime}_{\phi}D^{4}(W^{-}W^{+})(W^{-}W^{+})\] \[+ (\alpha_{\phi D}+\alpha^{\prime}_{\phi D})\Big{[}4(W^{-}W^{3})(W^ {+}W^{3})-4\frac{s_{W}}{c_{W}}(W^{-}B)(W^{+}W^{3})\] \[- 4\frac{s_{W}}{c_{W}}(W^{-}W^{3})(W^{+}B)+8(\frac{s_{W}}{c_{W}})^{ 2}(W^{-}B)(W^{+}B)+4\,(\frac{s_{W}}{c_{W}})^{2}(W^{-}W^{+})(BB)\] \[+ (W^{3}W^{3})^{2}-4\frac{s_{W}}{c_{W}}(W^{3}W^{3})(W^{3}B)+4\,( \frac{s_{W}}{c_{W}})^{2}(W^{3}B)^{2}\] \[+ 2(\frac{s_{W}}{c_{W}})^{2}(W^{3}W^{3})B^{2}-4\,(\frac{s_{W}}{c_{ W}})^{3}(W^{3}B)B^{2}+(\frac{s_{W}}{c_{W}})^{4}B^{4}\Big{]}\Big{\}}.\]

So, in \(1/\Lambda^{2}\) order we have changes in

\[\Delta g_{1}^{\gamma,Z};\qquad\Delta k_{\gamma,Z};\quad\Delta\widetilde{k}_{ \gamma,Z};\qquad\Delta\lambda_{\gamma,Z},\quad\Delta\widetilde{\lambda}_{ \gamma,Z};\]

and have no changes in

\[g_{4}^{\gamma,Z},\qquad g_{5}^{\gamma,Z}.\]

## 5 Quadrilinear interactions

Now we write down the set of interaction Lagrangians in order of their import ance. Mainly they are obtained by pure combinatorial methods.

In \(1/\Lambda^{0}\) order all possible combination of weak vector fields

\[B_{\mu}B_{\mu}B_{\nu}B_{\nu},\quad B_{\mu}\,B_{\mu}W^{i}_{\nu}W^{i}_{\nu;}\quad B _{\mu}B_{\nu}W^{i}_{\mu}W^{i}_{\nu;}\]

\[W^{i}_{\mu}W^{j}_{\mu}W^{j}_{\nu}W^{j}_{\nu},\quad W^{i}_{\mu}W^{i}_{\nu}W^{j} _{\mu}W^{j}_{\nu}\]

give two corresponding terms and may be parameterized only by two constants

\[{\cal L}^{(4)}_{0}=a_{01}(AA)(W^{+}W^{-})+a_{02}(AW^{+})(AW^{-}).\]

This part is most important because it is not have small \(1/\Lambda^{2}\) factor. To reproduce the SM we have to set \(a_{01}=-a_{02}=g^{2}\). Of course, these modifications of interaction will be seen at experiment first of all.

In \(1/\Lambda^{2}\) order terms

\[B_{\mu\nu}B_{\mu\nu}B_{\alpha}B_{\alpha},\quad B_{\mu\alpha}B_{\mu\beta}\,B_{ \alpha}B_{\beta},\quad B_{\mu\nu}\tilde{B}_{\mu\nu}B_{\alpha}B_{\alpha},\quad B _{\mu\alpha}\tilde{B}_{\mu\beta}\,B_{\alpha}B_{\beta}\]

produce only neutral bosons interactions.

For the rest of terms we give a list

\[\Lambda^{2}{\cal L}^{(4)}_{1}=a_{1}W^{+}_{\mu\nu}W^{-}_{\mu\nu}A_{\alpha}A_{ \alpha},\qquad\Lambda^{2}{\cal L}^{(4)}_{2}=a_{2}W^{+}_{\mu\nu}\widetilde{W}^{ -}_{\mu\nu}A_{\alpha}A_{\alpha},\]

\[\Lambda^{2}{\cal L}^{(4)}_{3}=a_{3}W^{+}_{\mu\alpha}W^{-}_{\mu\beta}A_{\alpha}A _{\beta},\qquad\Lambda^{2}{\cal L}^{(4)}_{4}=a_{4}W^{+}_{\mu\alpha}\widetilde{W }^{-}_{\mu\beta}A_{\alpha}A_{\beta},\]

\[\Lambda^{2}{\cal L}^{(4)}_{5}=a_{5}{\cal F}_{\mu\nu}{\cal F}_{\mu\nu}W^{+}_{ \alpha}W^{-}_{\alpha},\qquad\Lambda^{2}{\cal L}^{(4)}_{6}=a_{6}{\cal F}_{\mu\nu} \widetilde{{\cal F}}_{\mu\nu}W^{+}_{\alpha}W^{-}_{\alpha},\]\[\Lambda^{2}{\cal L}_{7}^{(4)}=\,a_{7}{\cal F}_{\mu\alpha}{\cal F}_{\mu\beta}W_{ \alpha}^{+}W_{\beta}^{-},\qquad\Lambda^{2}{\cal L}_{8}^{(4)}=\,a_{8}{\cal F}_{\mu \alpha}\widetilde{{\cal F}}_{\mu\beta}W_{\alpha}^{+}W_{\beta}^{-};\]

\[\Lambda^{2}{\cal L}_{9}^{(4)}=\,a_{9}{\cal F}_{\mu\nu}A_{\alpha}(W_{\mu\nu}^{+} W_{\alpha}^{-}+W_{\mu\nu}^{-}W_{\alpha}^{+}),\qquad\Lambda^{2}{\cal L}_{10}^{(4)}= \,a_{10}\widetilde{{\cal F}}_{\mu\nu}A_{\alpha}(W_{\mu\nu}^{+}W_{\alpha}^{-}+W _{\mu\nu}^{-}W_{\alpha}^{+});\]

\[\Lambda^{2}{\cal L}_{11}^{(4)}=a_{11}{\cal F}_{\mu\beta}A_{\beta}\,(W_{\mu \alpha}^{+}W_{\alpha}^{-}+W_{\mu\alpha}^{-}W_{\alpha}^{+}),\]

\[\Lambda^{2}{\cal L}_{12}^{(4)}=a_{12}\widetilde{{\cal F}}_{\mu\beta}A_{\beta} \,(W_{\mu\alpha}^{+}W_{\alpha}^{-}+W_{\mu\alpha}^{-}W_{\alpha}^{+}),\]

\[\Lambda^{2}{\cal L}_{13}^{(4)}=a_{13}{\cal F}_{\mu\beta}A_{\beta}\,(\widetilde {W}_{\mu\alpha}^{+}W_{\alpha}^{-}+\widetilde{W}_{\mu\alpha}^{-}W_{\alpha}^{+});\]

\[\Lambda^{2}{\cal L}_{14}^{(4)}=a_{14}{\cal F}_{\mu\beta}A_{\alpha}(W_{\mu \alpha}^{+}W_{\beta}^{-}+W_{\mu\alpha}^{-}W_{\beta}^{+}),\]

\[\Lambda^{2}{\cal L}_{15}^{(4)}=a_{15}\widetilde{{\cal F}}_{\mu\beta}A_{\alpha} (W_{\mu\alpha}^{+}W_{\beta}^{-}+W_{\mu\alpha}^{-}W_{\beta}^{+}),\]

\[\Lambda^{2}{\cal L}_{16}^{(4)}=a_{16}{\cal F}_{\mu\beta}A_{\alpha}(\widetilde {W}_{\mu\alpha}^{+}W_{\beta}^{-}+\widetilde{W}_{\mu\alpha}^{-}W_{\beta}^{+}).\]

These 16 terms are the next stage of experimental study. We do not want to reproduce the next order of expansion on \(\Lambda\), because the above terms give a lot of possibilities.

Let us mention in conclusion that additional interaction terms have to produce a larger cross-section at high energies. Without contradiction with unitarity consideration the cross-section for \(\gamma\gamma\to WW\) process will produce two-fold increase in comparison with \(\sim 80pb\) at \(\sqrt{s}=300GeV\).
