Introduction

During Summer 99', May 00' and July 00', test beam measurements have been performed on the Module 0 of the EM barrel calorimeter. Physics and calibration runs have been taken to test the performances and our understanding of the module.

One important feature concerns the crosstalk between the different parts of the calorimeter, namely the signal that flows in the other cells when one cell records a physical signal. A complete study has been made by using the 99' data, which allowed to identify and to quantify the major sources of crosstalk occuring on the electrodes themselves or through the electronic chain [1].

The crosstalk values have been completely correlated with test bench measurements made on the electrodes:

* values of resistors on the electrodes correlated with resistive crosstalk between the middle cells and the strips,
* shorts in HV layers correlated with a high capacitive crosstalk between the strips.

Moreover, the high inductive crosstalk between the middle and the back samplings was one of the main reasons to redesign the summing boards and mother boards.

One of the main conclusions of this study was therefore that test beam measurements of the crosstalk are a very good probe for the components of the module.

The aim of the present note is to study the behaviour of these components (resistors, HV layers, electronic boards,...) and its evolution with time by extracting the crosstalk measured during the 3 test beam campaigns done in 99' and in 00'. This note is intended as an addendum to the previous study [1]. The qualitative and quantitative explanations of the measured crosstalk will therefore not be recalled. Here are only recalled the main definitions. The crosstalk can be defined:

* by the maximum amplitude of the crosstalk signal normalised to the maximum amplitude of the signal V\({}_{\rm max}\) in the pulsed channel. This is referenced as the **peak-peak definition**,
* by the amplitude of the crosstalk signal at the pulsed signal peak normalised to V\({}_{\rm max}\). This is referenced as the **t\({}_{\rm max}\) definition**.

Even if the t\({}_{\rm max}\) definition gives in principle the most relevant quantities (because the signals are sampled at the pulsed signal peak), it is very time sensitive and thus is subject to large fluctuations. The peak-peak definition gives the most pessimistic value but allows a clearer understanding of the crosstalk. It has to be taken as an upper limit of the crosstalk.

In order to deal with relevant physical quantities, the gain factors of each cell (allowing to convert ADC counts to energy measurements) have been applied. They take mainly into account the injection resistances, the resistivity of the transmission cables and the different gains of the pre-amplifiers and of the shapers. The results presented in this note take these factors into account.

Every electronic cell is referenced by its eta coordinate which corresponds to its cell number (denoted \(\eta_{\,\text{layer}}\)) or by its channel number [1]. In May 00', only cells corresponding to \(191<\eta_{\,\text{front}}<384\) were equipped. Concerning the July 00' test, for technical reasons, only cells corresponding to \(\eta_{\,\text{front}}<384\) have been analyzed. During these periods, the calorimeter was equipped with new summing boards and mother boards.

## 2 Resistive crosstalk

The Middle and the Front are physically connected with resistors on the electrodes. This gives rise to a dominant resistive crosstalk between these samplings. The values of this crosstalk have been correlated with the values of the resistors measured in test bench [1]. A test beam measurement of this resistive crosstalk is thus a good tool to study the behaviour of the resistors.

The measurements extracted from 99' and 00' beam tests are presented as a function of \(\eta\) in figure 1.

Figure 1: Resistive crosstalk measurements between the middle and the front samplings, extracted from 99’, May 00’ and July 00’ beam tests. The middle cells belonging to the calibration lines 1 and 3 are pulsed. Peak-peak definition and t\({}_{max}\) definition are equivalent.

They show clearly that, despite the various cryogenics cycles that occured between the 3 tests, the values of the silk screened resistors have not changed. This is also confirmed by the figure 2, which presents the values of the crosstalk extracted from the July 00' beam test versus the ones obtained in 99'. One strip only (number 295) is away of the \(y=x\) line, having in 99 a singular low crosstalk value, which was back in 00' to a normal value.

## 3 Capacitive crosstalk

An important source of crosstalk in highly segmented detectors comes from a capacitive coupling between the different cells. This is the dominant coupling between the fine segmented strips of the EM barrel calorimeter front sampling.

Typical shapes of the crosstalk signals in the first and in the second neighbours of a pulsed strip recorded during the 99', the May 00' and the July 00' beam tests are shown in figure 3. As expected, this type of crosstalk has not changed between 99' and 00', neither in shape nor in amplitude. This is confirmed by figure 4, which shows the crosstalk values measured in the right neighbour of each pulsed strip, as obtained with the peak-peak definition. Results obtained with the t\({}_{\rm max}\) definition are presented in figure 5.

It can be reminded from [1] that:

* The lower (of roughly 2%) values of crosstalk are due to a capacitive coupling in the summing board connectors laying on the front mother boards. This later is not seen by one couple of strips over 16 (resp. 8) in the A electrode i.e. for \(\eta_{\rm strip}\leq 256\) (resp. in the B electrode i.e. for \(\eta_{\rm strip}>256\)), giving rise to a lower crosstalk.

Figure 2: Resistive crosstalk measurements between the middle and the front samplings, extracted from the July 00’ beam tests versus the 99’ ones.

Figure 3: Typical recorded shapes of (1) the pulsed signal in one strip, (2) the crosstalk in its first neighbour and (3) the crosstalk in its second neighbour, extracted from the 99’ (top), the May 00’ (middle) and the July 00’ (bottom) beam tests. The crosstalk signals are magnified by a factor 8.

Figure 4: Capacitive crosstalk measurement between one pulsed strip (of the \(\Phi_{\rm strip}=2\) line) and its right neighbour as a function of \(\eta\), extracted from 99’, May 00’ and July 00’ beam tests. The peak-peak definition has been used.

Figure 5: Capacitive crosstalk measurement between one pulsed strip (of the \(\Phi_{\rm strip}=2\) line) and its right neighbour as a function of \(\eta\), extracted from 99’, May 00’ and July 00’ beam tests. The \(t_{\rm max}\) definition has been used.

* The high crosstalk values (around 15%) are due to shorts in the HV layers. As can be seen in figure 4 and 5:
* There were 4 such values in the 99' data, corresponding to the couples of strips (40;41), (95;96), (157;158) and (226;227). They are also seen in the 00' data. These 4 shorts in the HV layers had also been detected in test bench.
* In May 00', two more high crosstalk values appeared, corresponding to shorts in the HV layers between the strips (199;200) and (355;356).
* In July 00', no more additional short is seen. It can be noticed that the module had been transported back to Annecy 1 between Summer 99' and May 00', which was not the case between May 00' and July 00'. Footnote 1: The module in vertical position underwent a cryogenic cycle in Annecy.
* There is a short in the signal layer between the strips 185 and 186, which had also been detected in 99'.

These results are for the \(\Phi_{\rm strip}=2\,\)line. If we look at the \(\Phi_{\rm strip}=3\,\)line, the following conclusions can be drawn:

* There are 5 shorts in the HV layers, corresponding to the couples of strips (19;20), (30;31), (110;111), (126;127) and (206;207). They are also seen in the 99' data.
* There are 6 shorts in the signal layer, corresponding to the couples of strips (2;3), (173;174), (188;189), (262;263), (274;275) and (435;436). Only the one between the strips 173 and 174 was not present in the 99' data.

As a conclusion, this study shows that the value of the capacitive crosstalk between the strips has not changed. It reveals however the presence of two additional shorts in HV layers (in addition to the 4 already existing) that appeared between Summer 99' and May 00' and which may be due to the transportation of the module.

## 4 Inductive crosstalk

The main source of crosstalk between the middle and the back samplings (middle to middle, middle to back, back to middle and back to back) comes from the mutual inductance between the cells and from the ground return. The quite high values seen in the 99' data motivated a review of the structure of the summing boards and of the mother boards, on which some ground pins were added. New boards were used for the 00' beam tests.

Typical shapes of the crosstalk signals seen in the middle and in the back cells, recorded during the 99', the May 00' and the July 00' beam tests are shown in figure 6 when the Middle is pulsed and in figure 7 when the Back is pulsed. It can be seen that the peak of the crosstalk signals has been lowered in the 00' data due to the redesign of the boards. The crosstalk at the peak of the pulsed signal is also smoother and thus less sensitive to the time determination. It has been copiously lowered in the middle to back and the back to middle cases.

Figure 6: Typical recorded shapes of (1) the pulsed signal in a middle cell (at \(\eta\) middle = 24), (2) the crosstalk in a neighbour middle cell and (3) the crosstalk in a neighbour back cell, extracted from the 99’ (top), the May 00’ (middle) and the July 00’ (bottom) beam tests. The crosstalk signals are magnified by a factor 30.

Figure 7: Typical recorded shapes of (1) the pulsed signal in a back cell (at \(\eta_{\text{ back}}=1\,2\)), (2) the crosstalk in a neighbour middle cell and (3) the crosstalk in a neighbour back cell, extracted from the 99’ (top), the May 00’ (middle) and the July 00’ (bottom) beam tests. The crosstalk signals are magnified by a factor 20.

These results are confirmed by a more quantitative study. The values of the inductive crosstalk are shown as a function of the mother board channel number in figure 8 when the middle cells of calibration line number 1 are pulsed and in figure 9 when the back cells of calibration line number 1 are pulsed. The results obtained with the three other calibration lines are similar. The corresponding distributions of the crosstalk values obtained with the peak-peak definition, including the four calibration lines, are presented in figure 10. The distributions obtained with the t\({}_{\max}\) definition are shown in figure 11.

Figure 8: Inductive crosstalk measurement in the barrel back mother boards, extracted from 99’, May 00’ and July 00’ beam tests. The middle cells of the calibration line number 1 are pulsed. These pulsed cells are marked with a vertical line. The upper (resp. lower) plots show the crosstalk in the middle (resp. back) channel numbers. The peak-peak definition has been used.

Figure 9: Inductive crosstalk measurement in the barrel back mother boards, extracted from 99’, May 00’ and July 00’ beam tests. The back cells of the calibration line number 1 are pulsed. These pulsed cells are marked with a vertical line. The upper (resp. lower) plots show the crosstalk in the middle (resp. back) channel numbers. The peak-peak definition has been used.

Figure 10: Distributions of the crosstalk values middle-middle (upper left), middle-back (upper right), back-middle (lower left) and back-back (lower right), extracted from 99’ (full blue line) and July 00’ (dashed red line) beam tests. The results obtained by pulsing the 4 calibrations lines are included. The peak-peak definition has been used.

Figure 11: Distributions of the crosstalk values middle-middle (upper left), middle-back (upper right), back-middle (lower left) and back-back (lower right), extracted from 99’ (full blue line) and July 00’ (dashed red line) beam tests. The results obtained by pulsing the 4 calibrations lines are included. The t\({}_{\rm max}\) definition has been used.

This allow to quantify the decrease of the inductive crosstalk due to the upgrade of the summing boards and of the mother boards to:

* a factor 1.4 (1.1 with the t\({}_{\text{max}}\) definition) for the middle to middle case,
* a factor 1.6 (1.9 with the t\({}_{\text{max}}\) definition) for the middle to back case,
* a factor 2.1 (1.8 with the t\({}_{\text{max}}\) definition) for the back to middle case,
* a factor 1.2 (1.2 with the t\({}_{\text{max}}\) definition) for the back to back case.

With this redesign, the inductive crosstalk is decreased by a factor 1.5 in average (using the peak-peak or the t\({}_{\text{max}}\) definitions) and the crosstalk signals are more stable at the time of the pulse.

Moreover, test bench measurements have shown that only the nearest neighbours of a pulsed channel do see a crosstalk, which was not the case with the old boards where the crosstalk was propagating further [2]. This result is confirmed by the test beam measurements, as shown in figure 12.

Figure 12: Crosstalk measured in the middle cells when the back cells of the calibration line number 1 are pulsed, extracted from 99’ (top) and July 00’ (bottom) beam tests. In this later case, only the nearest channel numbers of the pulsed ones do see a crosstalk.

Interesting structures appear when looking at the inductive crosstalk as a function of \(\eta_{\text{ cell}}\) (the eta coordinate of the cell) instead of its channel number. They are shown in figure 13 for the middle to middle crosstalk and for the middle to back crosstalk. These structures have the same periodicity as the non-uniformity of the module response (i.e. a 8 middle cells periodicity). Moreover, the crosstalk is relatively constant (the pattern can be easily understood by looking at the structure of the summing board connectors - see [1]) for the cells whose connector has one ground on each side (which appear with red points) and spreads out for those whose connector has only one ground on the left side (which appear with blue triangles). This is one of the main features that led to add an extra ground pin on the right side of the latter connectors.

## 5 Long distance crosstalk

Even if two cells are physically far away from each other, a so called "long distance" crosstalk can occur. For example, as the back and the front samplings are physically separated by the middle one, the crosstalk between them is very small, but does exist. As demonstrated in [1], it occurs through the calibration connectors and the feedthroughs.

The measured crosstalk, extracted from 99', May 00' and July 00' beam tests, is shown as a function of \(\eta\) in figure 14. In the upper (resp. lower) plot, the back cells of the odd (resp. even) calibration lines are pulsed. The peak-peak definition has been used.

Figure 13: Inductive crosstalk measurement (a) in the right neighbour on the electrode of the pulsed middle cells and (b) in the back cells when the Middle is pulsed, extracted from the July 00’ beam test as a function of \(\eta\). The red points correspond to cells whose connector has one ground on each side and the blue triangles to cells whose connector has only one ground on the left side. The results are averaged over \(\phi\) (the pattern is independent of \(\phi\)) and over the calibration lines. The peak-peak definition has been used.

Figure 14: Long distance crosstalk between one pulsed back cell and the strips in front of it, extracted from 99’, May 00’ and July 00’ beam tests. In the upper (resp. lower) plot, the back cells of the odd (resp. even) calibration lines and belonging to the \(\Phi_{\rm back}=8\) and 9 lines are pulsed.

The missing points in 99' are due to a lack of runs. The July 00' data allow thus to better see the 2 regions where the crosstalk is constant and very low (around 0.02%) because it is only due to the feedthroughs (there is no coupling in the calibration board connector for these regions [1]). Moreover, there are few large values (around 0.3%) of crosstalk signals in the May 00' and July 00' data which were not present in 99'. They are seen, for the May 00 data, when all the calibration lines of the fourth board are pulsed. In July 00, a problem appears not on the fourth but on the second calibration board, but only when the calibration line 3 is pulsed. Note also that there are few missing points at the beginning of the July 00' data because the calibration line 3 of the first mother board was dead.

## 6 Conclusions

Test beam measurements of the crosstalk are a very good probe for the components of the module. The analysis of the data recorded during 99', May 00' and July 00' beam tests leads to the following conclusions:

* The values of the silk screened resistors connecting the middle and the front samplings on the electrodes have not changed despite the various cryogenics cycles that occured between the 3 tests.
* The capacitive crosstalk between the strips has not changed, either in shape nor in amplitude. It reveals however the presence of two additional shorts in HV layers (in addition to the 4 already existing and detected in test bench and in test beam) that appeared between Summer 99' and May 00' and which may be due to the transportation of the module.
* The redesign of the summing boards and mother boards led to a decrease of the inductive crosstalk by a factor 1.5 in average.
* The study of the long distance crosstalk shows large values which may be due to some calibration boards.
