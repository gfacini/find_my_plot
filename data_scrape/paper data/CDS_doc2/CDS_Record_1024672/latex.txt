**Abstract**

Time resolution of the ATLAS Tile calorimeter modules has been measured using the test beam data. The resolution depends on the energy deposited in a given cell and is equal to about 1.5 \(ns\) at \(E=1\)\(GeV\), 270 \(ps\) at \(E=25\)\(GeV\) (high gain), 700 \(ps\) at \(E=25\)\(GeV\) (low gain) and 170 \(ps\) at \(E=150\)\(GeV\). These values have to be compared to the time of flight of relativistic particles to reach the first samples of Tile calorimeter (from 8.3 \(ns\) to 20 \(ns\)). Time-Of-Flight measurements using Tile Calorimeter can be used to identify and, combined with momentum measurements by the ATLAS inner detector, measure the mass of exotic heavy stable particles. The results are compared to a previous analysis using the ATLAS muon spectrometer[1].

## 1 ATLAS Tile calorimeter

The ATLAS [1] Tile Calorimeter [3] is a large hadronic sampling calorimeter which makes use of steel as the absorber material and scintillating plates read out by wavelength shifting (WLS) fibers as the active medium. The new feature of its design is the orientation of the scintillating tiles which are placed in plane perpendicular to the colliding beams and are staggered in depth.

The Tile Calorimeter consists of a cylindrical structure with an inner radius of 2280 mm and an outer radius of 4230 mm. It is subdivided into a 5640 mm long central barrel and two 2910 mm extended barrels. The scintillating tiles lie in the \(r-\phi\) (radius-azimuthal angle) plane and span the width of the module in the \(\phi\) direction. WLS fibers running radially collect the light from the tiles along their two open edges. Readout cells are then defined by grouping together a set of fibers into a photomultiplier (PMT), to obtain a three dimensional segmentation. In total there is 4928 readout cells. Radially, the calorimeter is segmented into three layers, approximately 1.4, 3.9 and 1.8 interaction lengths thick at pseudorapidity \(\eta=0\); the \(\Delta\eta\)x \(\Delta\phi\) segmentation is 0.1x0.1.

Each cell of the Tile Calorimeter is read-out by two PMTs in order to provide redundancy in the light read-out and improve spatial uniformity. The conversionof the light signal from the fiber bundles to electrical charge is done by the photomultipliers in the PMT blocks.

The output of the PMT block is a shaped electronic signal which is subsequently digitized by electronics inside the superdrawer (see Fig. 1). Two linear outputs (high and low gain) are used for each channel, differing in gain by a factor of 64.

## 2 Tile calorimetry time measurement

For the purpose of this analysis, test beam data of Tile calorimeter modules taken in 2002 and 2003 have been used. Tile calorimeter production modules have been irradiated by 180 \(GeV\) beam of negative pions at different pseudorapidities. The beam contained also muons, its contamination by electrons was very low. No special requirements have been imposed on the particle trajectory. For each PMT the time and energy are evaluated with the fit method [4], i.e. as the peak position and height of the shaped signal fit to the digitized pulse samples.

For a given cell (readout by two PMTs called \(e\)ven and odd) and a given interval of energies deposited in that cell the distribution of \(\Delta t=(t_{e}-t_{o})/2\) is plotted and its sigma is estimated by a gaussian fit. For relativistic particles the time of flight varies from approximately 8.3 \(ns\) for the cell A-1 to about 20 \(ns\) for the cell D-8 of the extended barrel. A particle that moves slower than relativistic particles and which interacts electromagnetically and/or hadronically will give the response delayed with respect to that of relativistic particles. In case of no correlations between the two time measurements \(t_{e}\) and \(t_{o}\), the value of \(\sigma_{\Delta t}\) is the best estimator of \(\sigma_{t}\) of a variable \(t=(t_{e}+t_{o})/2\). In ATLAS this variable \(t\) could serve as a measurement of the time of flight of particles with electromagnetic and/or hadronic interactions. Examples of \(\Delta t\) distributions are plotted on Fig. 2 and Fig. 3 for high gain and low gain respectively.

On Fig. 4 time resolutions for low gain and high gain of the same cell are compared for two different test beam runs. More distributions [10] showing a comparison of resolution curves for different cells in the same module are in Fig. 5 and Fig. 6. The resolution has been parametrized by a quadratic sum of statistical (proportional to \(1/\sqrt{E}\)) and noise (proportional to \(1/E\)) terms (E is in \(GeV\)):

\[\sigma_{t}\left(E\right)=\frac{p_{0}}{\sqrt{E}}\oplus\frac{p_{1}}{E}=\sqrt{ \left(\frac{p_{0}}{\sqrt{E}}\right)^{2}+\left(\frac{p_{1}}{E}\right)^{2}} \tag{1}\]

As indicated on Fig. 4-6, the resolution curves are quite similar for different cells, moreover in the ATLAS environment these curves could eventually be obtained for each Tile cell. For further analysis we took the parametrization of the time resolution for the cell A-6 (see Fig. 5) with following values of parameters:High Gain \(p_{0}\) = 1.45 ns \(\cdot GeV^{1/2}\), \(p_{1}\) = 0.38 ns \(\cdot GeV\)

Low Gain \(p_{0}\) = 1.7 ns \(\cdot GeV^{1/2}\), \(p_{1}\) = 17.2 ns \(\cdot GeV\).

## 3 Detection of heavy stable particles with Tile calorimeter and Inner detector

There are different theories predicting an existence of heavy particles stable enough to be detected prior to their decay. For recent references see e.g. [5]. A possibility to measure such particles in ATLAS using time of flight measurement performed by the muon system has been thoroughly discussed in [1].

In this paper we discuss a possibility to detect such particles and measure their mass using the time measurement performed by the Tile calorimeter combined with the momentum measurement using ATLAS inner detector (ID).

The velocity of a particle that deposits energy in the Tile calorimeter cell \(i\) located at a distance \(L_{i}\) from the interaction pion could be measured as follows:

\(\beta_{tile}=\frac{L_{i}/c}{t_{tile,i}-t_{rel,i}+L_{i}/c}\)

where for a given cell \(i\) the variable \(t_{tile,i}=\frac{t_{e}+t_{a}}{2}\) is the time measured in a given event, while \(t_{rel,i}=\langle\frac{t_{e}+t_{a}}{2}\rangle\) is the mean value of the time measured over all events in a given cell. The latter is the time of flight of the relativistic particle.

The precision in measurement of \(\beta\) is given by a formula:

\(\sigma_{\beta}=\beta^{2}\frac{\sigma_{t_{tile}\oplus\sigma_{t_{rel}}\oplus \frac{t_{tile}-t_{rel}}{L_{i}/c}\sigma_{L_{i}/c}}}{L_{i}/c}\)

Dominant contribution to the velocity uncertainty is due to the first term. The precision of the mean value over many events \(\sigma_{t_{rel}}\) is certainly much better. Also the third term contributes very little to the overall velocity resolution.

In general the particle deposits the energy in couple of Tile calorimeter cells. The particle's velocity could be evaluated for each cell and the measurements could be combined with weights proportional to \(1/\sigma_{\beta}^{2}\).

When the particle's momentum \(p\) and velocity \(\beta\) are measured, the mass of the particle could be evaluated as follows:

\[M=\frac{p}{\beta\gamma}=p\frac{\sqrt{1-\beta^{2}}}{\beta} \tag{2}\]

The mass resolution is then given:

\[\sigma_{M}=\partial_{p}M\sigma_{p}\oplus\partial_{\beta}M\sigma_{\beta}=\sqrt {\left(\partial_{p}M\sigma_{p}\right)^{2}+\left(\partial_{\beta}M\sigma_{ \beta}\right)^{2}} \tag{3}\]

To estimate the mass resolution, the following assumptions about momentum and velocity resolutions and particles energy losses in the Tile calorimeter have been made:* To get a conservative estimate we assume that particle's velocity is measured by the closest to the ATLAS interaction point Tile calorimeter cell A-1. Then \(\beta_{tile}=\frac{8.3ns}{t_{tile}}\) and consequently \(\sigma_{\beta_{tile}}=\beta^{2}\frac{\sigma_{t}(E_{tile})}{8.3ns}\), where \(\sigma_{t}\left(E_{tile}\right)\) is given by formula (1) with quadratically added constant time resolution term of 70 \(ps\). This term is caused by the time spread of the primary interaction due to finite lengths of the LHC proton bunches. The primary interaction could appear anytime within a time window of \(\frac{L_{bunch}}{30cmns^{-1}}\), i.e. the time of the primary interaction has a dispersion of \(\frac{L_{bunch}}{30cmns^{-1}}\frac{1}{\sqrt{12}}\) which equals to \(70ps\) for \(L_{bunch}=7cm\).
* Purely hadronic losses of heavy stable particles have been parametrized using results of [6]. For 1 \(m\) of iron they are roughly equal to 4% and 1.2% of kinetic energy for the mass M=100 and 600 GeV respectively[6]. Because the thickness of the Tile calorimeter is more than 1.5 \(m\), the values of the slopes have been rescaled accordingly.
* Ionization losses in TileCal have been parametrized as \(\Delta E_{ioniz}=2.2GeV/\beta^{2}\) using a measured value of the most probable muon losses (2.2 \(GeV\)) in the Tile calorimeter at small pseudorapidities. Energy losses up to kinetic energy of the particle have been allowed. The particles with the mass of 200 (1000) \(GeV\) and a momentum smaller than about 80 (260) \(GeV\) are stopped at the Tile calorimeter.
* approximate precision of the momentum measurement with the ATLAS inner detector at the investigated momentum region [8];
* approximate precision of the momentum measurement with the ATLAS muon spectrometer at the region of interest [9];
* anticipated precision of the velocity measurement using the muon system [1];

On Fig. 7,8 and 9 the mass resolution \(\sigma_{M}/M\) for three different masses (200, 500 and 1000 \(GeV\)) of particles are plotted as a function of a momentum at pseudorapidity close to \(\eta=\)0. The resolution of Tile+ID is compared with that of the muon system.

## 4 Discussion of results and conclusions

For particles of low mass the results of Tile+ID are compatible with an anticipated precision of the muon spectrometer, for the case of hadronic losses it is even better. For masses around 500 \(GeV\) Tile+ID precision is worse than that of the muon spectrometer, but it still could improve the muon measurements. For the highest masses the Tile+ID precision is significantly worse than that of the muon spectrometer, however with Tile calorimeter being closer to the interaction point, a possible range of measurements of the muon spectrometer can be extended. This feature is indicated on Fig. 7-9 by limits which correspond to a limit of \(\beta>0.5\) required for a correct reconstruction of the track in muon system [1] and to a limit of \(\beta>8.3ns/(8.3+25)ns=0.25\) ensuring the signal in the first cells of the Tile is seen within a correct bunch crossing.

In overlapping regions, the Tile+ID and muon measurements can be combined in order to improve the resolution. This is true for charged exotic particles measured both by Tile and muon spectrometer.

For the case of hadronically interacting particles, there are following possibilities in addition:

* In case of neutral particles with hadron interactions, the Tile calorimeter time of flight measurement can identify these particles giving, however, only lower limit of their mass.
* In the case of charged particles which are converted to neutral within Tiles, only Tile measurements will be available.
* In the case when particle is neutral, in Tile it interacts hadronically and converts to charged particle, muon measurements of its mass can be improved using the time of flight measurements performed by the Tile calorimeter.

An important question arises what deterioration of the time measurement is expected due to the pile-up effect. On Fig. 10,11 and 12 the contributions to the mass resolution due to momentum and time precisions are plot. For the particles with mass of 200 GeV, the Tile calorimeter time uncertainty dominates the errors, while the dominant contribution to the mass resolution for particles with mass larger than 500 GeV is due to uncertainty in the momentum measurement of the ID.

The results obtained in this analysis are encouraging and indicate a very good potential of ATLAS to measure heavy stable exotic particles with electromagnetic and/or hadronic interactions.
