###### Abstract

A status report on the thermal perfomance of the baseline SCT inner forward modules is presented. In order to understand possible improvements of the thermal behaviour, design changes that have been proposed elsewhere for the outer module [1] and which lead to significant improvements of the thermal characteristics of the module, have been applied to the inner module.

## 1 Introduction

Using the Finite Element Method (FEM) with ANSYS code, thermal simulations related to the runaway problem [2] for the ATLAS SCT forward modules have been carried out. In an earlier note [1] the problem of the cooling of the outer SCT forward modules was investigated.

After introducing step-by-step the same design changes as proposed in [1], ANSYS calculations indicate that significant improvements of the thermal properties of the inner module can be achieved.

## 2 Module components

In this note, the forward modules have been assumed to be constructed using the materials shown in Table 1 (t = thickness, k = the thermal conductivity):

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|c|} \hline  & & & Thermal \\
**Item** & **Material** & **Thichness t** & conductivity k \\  & & (mm) & (W/m/\({}^{\text{0}}\)K) \\ \hline Hybrid & BeO & 0.50 & 260 \\ \hline Silicon wafers & Si & 0.30 & 136 \\ \hline Adhesive & Araldite & 0.05 & 0.42 \\ \hline Spine & TPG & 0.50 & 1700 (in plane) \\  & & & 8 (out of plane) \\ \hline Mechanical bridges & AIN & 0.50 & 180 \\ \hline Thermal separation & Quartz (glass) & 0.30 & 1.50 \\ \hline Positioning elements & PEEK & - & 0.25 \\ \hline Thermal connection & Grease & 0.025 & 0.40 \\ \hline Cooling Block & Aluminium & - & 190 \\ \hline Cooling Pipe & CuNi or & 0.2 wall & 29 \\  & Aluminium & 0.2 wall & 190 \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}

## 3 Method of modelling.

For some parts of the module and the cooling blocks, it is assumed that the temperature is constant through the thickness of the sub-element considered. For these cases, a two dimensional simulation of the elements is made.

On the other hand, the silicon wafers are treated as three dimensional thermal-electric elements. This means that the temperature distribution in the wafers is determined from the flow of direct electric current. Furthermore, the electrical conductivity of the wafers depends on temperature. The ANSYS code, which is based on the finite element method (FEM), allows a coupled-field analysis that uses coupled-field elements.

The thermal resistances of the glue layers at the interfaces of Si-AIN, quartz-AIN and quartz-BeO, have been estimated using separate numerical calculations and have then been introduced to the module model.

The FEM model of the inner forward module for the SCT detector is shown in Figure 1. It represents the baseline design. In the modelling of the cooling blocks it is assumed that an aluminium cooling pipe having an outer diameter of 4 mm and a wall thickness of 0.2 mm at the connection to the cooling block, is used. At the top surface of the cooling block, it is assumed that the module contact is made using a grease contact of thickness 0.025 mm.

Following these changes to the module design, the results of thermal calculations are shown in Figure 9 and Figure 10, and in Table 5.

In this case, the heat transfer through the fan-in again becomes lower (approximately 0.32 W instead of 0.44 W). It is noteworthy that the temperature of the silicon wafers is significantly reduced (from -3.5 \({}^{\mathrm{o}}\)C to -16.1 \({}^{\mathrm{o}}\)C), and significantly more uniform. The maximal temperature difference in the silicon wafers is reduced from 4.5 \({}^{\mathrm{o}}\)C to 1.6 \({}^{\mathrm{o}}\)C.

Moreover, the critical value of the fluid temperature is higher, that is -18.6 \({}^{\mathrm{o}}\)C. Assuming such a value of the fluid temperature and all the changes introduced into the module design, the temperature distribution in the silicon wafer is as shown in Figure 9. The only real difference is that all the temperatures are higher by 5.9 \({}^{\mathrm{o}}\)C because the fluid temperature is now higher by this value. After 10 years of detector operation, the temperature distribution in the silicon wafer is as shown in Figure 11. The operational characteristics at the critical temperature, after 10 years of LHC operation, are listed in Table 5.

The design changes proposed above have been:

a) an increase of the gap between the hybrid and silicon wafers from 2 mm to 5 mm,

b) the use of a split cooling block, and

c) a modification of the fan-in shape.

## 5 Conclusions

The Ansys calculations described in this note indicate that:

a) Using the existing baseline outer module and cooling block arrangement, a coolant temperature of less than -24.5 \({}^{0}\)C is required. The absolute coolant temperature value is sensitive to the detailed cooling block design, and to the heat transfer coefficients that are assumed.

b) The variation of the sensor temperature across the surface of the outer module is not satisfactory for the baseline design.

c) By changes to the module design (an increased separation between the sensors and the hybrid, changing the shape of the fan-in and using a split cooling block), these problems can be

The maximum temperature on the silicon wafers is reduced from -3.5 \({}^{0}\)CC to -16.8 \({}^{0}\)C and the maximum temperature variation across the silicon wafers is reduced from 4.5 \({}^{0}\)C to 1.9 \({}^{0}\)C, after 10 years of LHC operation. In addition, the critical temperature of the fluid is 7.7 \({}^{0}\)C higher (-16.8 \({}^{0}\)C as compared with -24.5 \({}^{0}\)C).
