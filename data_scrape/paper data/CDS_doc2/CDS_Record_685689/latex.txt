###### Abstract

A novel electro-optical alignment system has been developed consisting of infrared laser beams as references and arrays of semi-transparent optical sensors for beam position measurements in several layers. The system provides a conceptually simple and economical solution for the alignment monitoring requirements of the ATLAS muon spectrometer. With a particular choice of sensors, custom designed silicon strip photodiodes, a more than sufficient position resolution has been achieved. Other transparent sensor technologies are also under investigation.

Motivation and Principle

At the Max-Planck-Institut fur Physik (MPI), a novel electro-optical alignment system is under development for the ATLAS muon spectrometer. It is optimized [1] for the projective alignment of large chamber systems. Each individual alignment path consists of a laser beam as reference and an array of semi-transparent optical sensors which measure its position simultaneously at several points along the beam without destroying it.

In the ATLAS application, the optical detectors are attached to the corners of the projective muon chambers and laser rays are pointing throught them to the interaction point. In this way, the muon chambers belonging to a projective tower can be aligned relative to each other using a sufficient number of alignment beams. The overall number of laser beams needed can be reduced by factors \(2-4\) by simultaneously aligning adjacent chamber towers in \(rz\) and/or \(r\phi\) with common laser beams traversing overlapping sensors belonging to the neighbouring This would also open up the possibility to monitor the alignment of the chamber towers relative to each other. In this scheme, \(5-11\) optical sensors are aligned on each laser beam. Details of a possible global layout for the ATLAS muon chamber alignment system are given in [2].

The proposed alignment system provides a conceptually simple and economical solution for the projective muon chamber alignment. The same system can also be used as multi-point monitor of the internal straightness of the chambers in case this would be necessary.

The technical implementation of the alignment system has the following features:

* Chamber alignment over large distances (typically \(4-8\)\(m\) required for the ATLAS muon spectrometer) by using diffraction limited laser beams with diameters limited to less than \(3\)\(mm\) over \(8\)\(m\), for example.
* Non-distructive beam position measurement at many locations along the reference beam by using semi-transparent optical sensors. With suitable choice of readout electronics, up to about \(15\) sensors per beam can be achieved.
* Absolute \(2\)-dimensional position measurement over a large range with active sensor areas of \(2\times 2\)\(cm^{2}\) or larger as required for monitoring the movements of large chamber systems.
* No restrictions in the angle of incidence of the projective laser beams on the sensors located in the chamber planes.
* Continuous monitoring of the chamber alignment.

Alignment systems with laser beams and transparent optical sensors are already used in several commercial applications. For the ATLAS alignment system, we aim at higher precision. The particular sensor technology described below is also under investigation for the alignment of the tracking chambers at fixed target experiments (HERMES) and for accelerator alignment (TESLA).

## 2 The Optical Sensors

Position-sensitive semi-transparent optical sensors can be realized as silicon strip photodiodes. This now standard technology for mini-vertex particle detectors has been adapted for optical measurements. The segmentation of the large area diodes into strips provides accurate and robust position measurement. By using pattern recognition, effects of background light sources and beam reflections (relevant only at short distances) can be eliminated. Possible distortions of the laser beam profile can be taken into account as long as they are stable in time.

At room temperature, the bandgap of pure crystalline silicon is 1.12 \(eV\) corresponding to an upper limit of 1100 \(nm\) to the sensitive wavelength range of silicon photodiodes. The absorption curve of silicon (see Figures 2 and 8) is dropping steeply near the infrared sensitivity limit. At \(\lambda=1064\ nm\), the absorption coefficient of silicon at \(300^{\circ}K\) is \(\alpha=11\ cm^{-1}\) corresponding to a transmission rate of about 70% for a 300 \(\mu m\) thick silicon wafer. This leaves still 3% of the light beam power after traversing 10 detectors.

Diffraction limited Gaussian light beams at a wavelength of 1064 \(nm\) can be produced with Nd:YAG lasers (diode pumped) or, alternatively, by InGaAs laser diodes with the light output coupled into a single-mode optical fiber.

The silicon strip photodiodes tested at MPI were custom designed by CSEM in Neuchatel for the optical alignment purposes. They have the following properties (see also Figure 3):

* active area of \(20\times 20\ mm^{2}\) for large measurement range;
* covered with 67 implanted \(p^{+}\) strips of 300 \(\mu m\) width and pitch optimized for the \(2-3\ mm\) diameter diffraction limited laser beam;
* no metallization on front or back side in the active area to allow for light transmission; the \(n^{+}\) contact is a ring around the active area on the front side;
* thickness of 300 \(\mu m\) (standard silicon wafer) with measured light transmission rate of 71% at 1064 \(nm\) in agreement with expectation [3];
* sufficient sensitivity of 0.1 \(A/W\) at 1064 \(nm\);* manufactured on double-sided polished wafers which let the light go through without significant distortion of the beam profile (standard wafers, unpolished on the back side, destroy the beam by diffuse scattering);
* anti-reflective silicon nitride coating on the front side reducing the reflection rate to 2.6% at 1064 \(nm\);
* electrical properties: high strip resistance of 20.8 \(k\Omega\), junction capacitance of 278 \(pF\) per strip, dark current of \(\leq 100\)\(pA\);
* readout of the strips on both sides without bias voltage, modulated light power and high pass filter for background light suppression;
* price per \(20\times 20\)\(mm^{2}\) sensor on the order of 150.\(-\) SFR for the amounts needed for the whole ATLAS muon spectrometer (\(\approx 2000\) sensors [2]); for a smaller sensor area of \(14\times 14\)\(mm^{2}\), the price could go down to 100.\(-\) SFR per sensor since then twice as many (16) fit on one wafer;

The transmission rate can be increased at the same wavelength and without loss in sensitivity by grinding down the silicon wafers to smaller thicknesses after wafer processing. Another possibility (for special applications, not for the ATLAS muon chambers) is cooling of the sensors to liquid nitrogen or helium temperatures since the bandgap of silicon increases at lower temperatures

## 3 Sensor Performance

The silicon strip sensors provide 2-dimensional position information. The strips give an accurate and robust ("digital") position measurement which will be used in the bending coordinate of the muon spectrometer. The laser beam position is determined as the average of the precisely known strip positions \(x_{i}\) under the beam spot (\(i=1,...,N\), \(N=6-8\)) weighted with the measured photo currents \(I_{i}\) on each strip:

\[\overline{x}=\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{N}x_{i}I_{i}}{\sum_{i=1}^{N}I_{i}}. \tag{1}\]

The resolution depends on the signal-to-noise ratio \(\overline{\Delta I_{i}}/\sum_{i}I_{i}\) and geometrical factors including the strip pitch \(b\) and the number of strips covered by the beam:

\[(\Delta\overline{x})^{2}=\biggl{(}\frac{b\overline{\Delta I_{i}}}{\sum_{i=1}^ {N}I_{i}}\biggr{)}^{2}\sum_{i=1}^{N}[\frac{x_{1}-\overline{x}}{b}+(i-1)]^{2}. \tag{2}\]

With laser power in the range \(10-100\)\(mW\), photo current fluctuations \(\overline{\Delta I_{i}}/I_{i}\) in each channel were dominated by the stability of the electronics calibration (better than 1%). A local position resolution of \(\sigma_{x}\approx 3\)\(\mu m\). Non-uniform strip response leads to an additional non-linearity error in the position measurement of \(\sigma_{x}^{lin}\approx 15\ \mu m\) over the whole sensor surface (see Figure 4). The large scale non-linearity effect is reproducible and can be corrected for. It may also be possible to improve the uniformity of the response by applying a reverse bias voltage. In principle, non-uniform response could be eliminated by completely depleting the detectors. The present sensor were, however, not designed for that purpose.

The requirements for beam position measurement in the coordinate orthogonal to the bending plane are considerably weaker than in the bending direction. The second coordinate (\(y\)) is determined by current division reading out each strip on both sides and measuring the asymmetry in the photo currents:

\[\frac{I_{L}-I_{R}}{I_{L}+I_{R}}=1-\frac{2y}{L} \tag{3}\]

where \(L=20\ \mu m\) is the length of the strips. The intrinsic resolution of the analog current division measurement is only limited by the signal-to-noise ratio of detectors and electronics to a few micron. The actual resolution is dominated by fluctuations in the strip resistivity which lead deviations from linearity in the position measurement. In the central \(10\times 10\ mm^{2}\) area of the sensors, the non-linearity error is only \(\sigma_{y}^{lin}=15\ \mu m\) averaged over 4 strips (see Figure 5). This effect is reproducible and specific for each detector and can therefore be corrected for.

## 4 Optical Aberrations

Optical refraction of the laser beam when traversing the silicon sensors was identified as the most significant systematic effect affecting the sensor array of an alignment path as a whole. The refraction index of silicon for infrared light at 1064 \(nm\) is rather large, \(n=3.58\). Two effects contribute to aberrations of the beam. Unavoidable small wedge angles \(\varepsilon\) between the two surfaces of the sensors lead to beam deflections by angles \(\delta\approx(n-1)\varepsilon\) increases linearly with distance from the sensor. For non-normal incidence even on exactly parallel surfaces, the finite thickness \(d\) of the detectors causes parallel displacement of the beam. The displacement increases with the angle \(\alpha\) relative to normal incidence approaching a value of \(d\) for \(\alpha=90^{\circ}\).

Beam deflections for normal incidence have been measured with 3 \(\mu m\) accuracy in each coordinate using a setup of two strip detectors with orthogonal strip directions at small relative distance such that the beam deflection in between is negligible. The beam refraction for other angles of incidence can then be predicted from geometrical optics.

In spite of the double-sided polishing of the silicon detectors, small surface unregularities, fluctuations in thickness and wedge angle, remain which lead to deflections of the beam depending on the position on the sensor. Maximumdeflections were found on the order of 200 \(\mu m\) over 2 \(m\) corresponding to local wedge angles of \(\varepsilon\approx 40\)\(\mu rad\). Significant variations in the deflection occur on a scale of about 1 \(mm\). Scans of the senor surfaces (see Figure 6) revealed that a 0.5 \(mm\times 0.5\)\(mm\) grid is sufficient to interpolate and correct for the deflections with a remaining uncertainty over 2\(-\)4 \(m\) on the order of the local strip resolution.

For the ATLAS muon chamber tower alignment, one only has to apply deflection corrections in the middle chamber layer. If the overlapping sensors in this layer (see Figure 1) are mounted close enough to each other (relative distance of about \(\leq 1\)\(cm\)), a deflection correction is only required for a single sensor per beam, the last one traversed.

The performance of an array of 3 sensors was tested on a 4 \(m\) long granite table with surface flatness better than 3 \(\mu m\) serving as absolute reference. The 3 sensors were mounted, thermally decoupled via thin ceramic holders, on polished steel frames and placed directly on the table at 1.6 \(m\) relative distance. In this way, the strip positions of each sensor are defined vertically within 1 \(\mu m\) relative to the surface of the table. Applying corrections for beam refraction in the middle sensor using a 0.5 \(mm\times 0.5\)\(mm\) surface scan, the vertical sagitta of an approximately horizontal Nd:YAG laser beam was measured with a mean of \(-\)1.1 \(\mu m\) and 7.5 \(\mu m\) standard deviation (see Figure 7).

## 5 Alternative Sensor Technologies

An alternative semi-transparent optical sensor technology are Schottky photodiodes made of thin films (\(\leq 1\)\(\mu m\) thickness) of amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) in contact with thin light-transparent metallic layers (InSn oxide, ITO). The production process is adapted from the solar cell and thin-film transistor (used for LCD control) technology and is relatively simple (and cheap). The a-Si film is deposited by Chemical Vapor Deposition between two ITO layers on one side of a glas substrate. The two metallic layers can be segmented into orthogonal rows of strips with photolithographic methods in order to form a double-sided strip detector. Very large detector areas of up to \(300\times 300\)\(mm^{2}\) can be produced in a single piece with high linearity and position resolution due to the digital strip readout.

Amorphous silicon has an effective bandgap of 1.51 \(eV\) with light sensitivity ending at about \(\lambda=820\)\(nm\) (see Figure 8). For a 1 \(\mu m\) thin a-Si sensor, transmission rates of 12% and 60%, including reflection, have been measured at wavelengths of 633 \(nm\) and 690 \(nm\), respectively. These wavelengths are conveniently produced by HeNe lasers or relatively cheap laser diodes (which achieve high quality Gaussian beam profile by coupling the light into a single-mode optical fiber). At 690 \(nm\), the light sensitivity of the sensors is still 0.1 \(A/W\) comparable with the crystalline silicon sensors. The transmission can be further increased by making the a-Si film even thinner.

The a-Si sensors can be deposited on glass substrates polished to optical quality. Together with the \(\leq 1\)\(\mu m\) thickness of the amorphous silicon film and the lower refraction index of glass compared to silicon at the respective wavelengths, this could make corrections for beam refraction easier.

The amorphous silicon strip detectors are still under development and have to be optimized. So far, position resolutions of better than 10 \(\mu m\) in each coordinate, including non-linear response, have been reached with this new technology.

## 6 The Optical Fiber Distribution System

For the distribution of the laser light to the individual alignment paths in the ATLAS muon spectrometer, an optical fiber system is foreseen. By using fiber splitters or fiber switches (both commercially available), a few radiation shielded lasers can feed the whole alignment system of several hundred alignment beams [2]. The collimator optics at the fiber outputs can be easily mounted to the chambers. Alternatively, small laser diodes could also be directly attached to the chambers for each alignment beam.

## 7 Conclusions

A novel optical alignment system has been developed for the ATLAS muon spectrometer. It is optimized for the alignment of large chamber systems with its large measurement range (\(\geq 2\)\(cm\)) over large distances (\(>8\)\(m\)). The straightforward concept of laser beams as alignment references traversing arrays of transparent optical position detectors provides an economical solution for the ATLAS alignment requirements. The capability of aligning many sensors belonging to adjacent chamber towers on a common laser beam allows to reduce the number of projective alignment paths by factors \(2-4\). A test program has shown that the silicon strip photodiodes are sufficiently transparent for infrared light at 1064 \(nm\) (Nd:YAG lasers) and that they provide absolute 2-dimensional position information with more than sufficient resolution in the few micron range. Alternative sensor technologies are also being investigated.

The proposed alignment concept is also under investigation for accelerator lattices and tracking detectors at fixed target experiments. It is already in use (with a different sensor technology) in commercial applications. One could also imagine to use the alignment system in the ATLAS central tracker (the silicon detectors could simultaneously serve as transparent optical detectors for infrared laser beams).
