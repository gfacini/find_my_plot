## 1 Introduction

Extensions to the Standard Model (SM) may include heavy gauge bosons, called \(W^{\prime}\) and \(Z^{\prime}\) bosons in the following, which are heavier versions of the SM \(W\) and \(Z\) bosons. New heavy gauge bosons appear if the gauge group of the SM is extended, as in Grand Unified Theories, Little-Higgs models [1; 2], left-right symmetric models [3; 4; 5]. As an example, the Sequential Standard Model (SSM) [6] posits \(W^{\prime}_{\text{SSM}}\) and \(Z^{\prime}_{\text{SSM}}\) bosons with couplings to fermions that are identical to those of the SM \(W\) or \(Z\) boson. This model is often used in analyses as a benchmark and is useful for comparing the sensitivity of different experiments. An example inspired by Grand Unified Theories are the E\({}_{6}\)-motivated [7; 8] theories which predict as a special case \(Z^{\prime}_{\psi}\) bosons, which are considered in this note. In addition, \(W^{\prime}\) and \(Z^{\prime}\) bosons are forecast in theories with universal extra dimension, like Kaluza-Klein excitation of the SM \(W\) and \(Z\) bosons [9; 10; 11], and in theories that with a strongly-coupled sector, such as Topcolour-assisted Technicolar [12] and composite-Higgs [13; 14] theories.

New heavy gauge bosons are searched for in various final states in ATLAS using the \(\sqrt{s}=13\)\(\mathrm{Te\kern-1.0ptV}\) data. In this note, the prospects for \(W^{\prime}\) bosons searches in the \(W^{\prime}\to t\bar{b}\to\ell\nu b\bar{b}\) and \(W^{\prime}\to\ell\nu\) decay channel, where the lepton is an electron or a muon1, are summarised. \(Z^{\prime}\) bosons are searched for in the final states \(Z^{\prime}\to\ell\ell\) and \(Z^{\prime}\to t\bar{t}\). The ATLAS search for \(W^{\prime}\) bosons in the \(W^{\prime}\to t\bar{b}\to\ell\nu b\bar{b}\) final state excluded at the 95% confidence limit (CL) right-handed \(W^{\prime}\) bosons (\(W^{\prime}_{\text{R}}\)), with a coupling to the SM particles equal to the SM weak coupling constant, with masses up to 3.15\(\mathrm{Te\kern-1.0ptV}\) using 36\(\mathrm{fb}^{-1}\) of data [15]. The search for \(W^{\prime}\to e\nu\) and \(W^{\prime}\to\mu\nu\) signals [16] used 79.8\(\mathrm{fb}^{-1}\) of data taken at \(\sqrt{s}=13\)\(\mathrm{Te\kern-1.0ptV}\). This analysis used a SSM \(W^{\prime}\) boson as benchmark and reported a lower exclusion limit at 95% CL on the \(W^{\prime}_{\text{SSM}}\) pole mass of 5.6\(\mathrm{Te\kern-1.0ptV}\). The \(Z^{\prime}\to\ell\ell\) analysis [17] based on 36.1\(\mathrm{fb}^{-1}\) of data 95% CL reports lower mass limits of 4.5\(\mathrm{Te\kern-1.0ptV}\) for \(Z^{\prime}_{\text{SSM}}\) bosons and 3.8\(\mathrm{Te\kern-1.0ptV}\) for \(Z^{\prime}_{\psi}\) bosons. This analysis also provides lower mass limits on several other \(Z^{\prime}\) boson models. The search for \(Z^{\prime}\) bosons in the \(t\bar{t}\) final state [18] using 36.1\(\mathrm{fb}^{-1}\) of data allowed to exclude at 95% CL the \(Z^{\prime}\) bosons as predicted by Topcolour-assisted Technicolour model (\(Z^{\prime}_{\text{TC2}}\)), using a width of 1% for the \(Z^{\prime}_{\text{TC2}}\) boson, upper limits on the production cross-sections vary from 25 pb to 0.02 pb for masses from 0.4\(\mathrm{Te\kern-1.0ptV}\) to 5\(\mathrm{Te\kern-1.0ptV}\).

Footnote 1: In the following, the term lepton (\(\ell\)) is used to refer to an electron or a muon.

Searches for new heavy gauge bosons are an important part of the physics programme at the HL-LHC as they profit significantly from the expected increase in luminosity to 3000 fb\({}^{-1}\) of \(pp\) collisions to be taken at \(\sqrt{s}=14\)\(\mathrm{Te\kern-1.0ptV}\). In case of a discovery, the search for such particles in different decay channels (not only the ones reported here) will help to shed light on the underlying theory. Some of the above mentioned analyses were studied in the past for the HL-LHC running for ATLAS. The \(W^{\prime}\to\mu\nu\) prospect studies shown in Ref. [19] only looked at the improvements of the foreseen muon trigger. A first prospective High Luminosity (HL) LHC ATLAS analysis for \(Z^{\prime}_{\text{SSM}}\) boson decaying leptonically is summarised in Ref. [20]. Compared to the previous analysis, this study uses the latest layout of the upgraded ATLAS detector, and considers a higher value for average pile-up \(\langle\mu\rangle\). In addition, it was found that the signal cross-sections used in the previous analysis were too high. A first update of these results was presented in Ref. [21] while a prospects study for a search for \(Z^{\prime}\) bosons from CMS can be found in Ref. [22].

The results of the analyses reported in this note are based on Monte Carlo (MC) simulations with an upgraded detector [23; 24; 25; 26; 19; 21]. As discussed in more detail in Section 3, parameterised estimates are applied to the final state particles to simulate the response of the upgraded ATLAS detector and pile-up collisions. The prospects for a discovery or exclusion of such new heavy bosons has been studied in severaldecay channels. To allow comparisons with the published results using 36.1 fb\({}^{-1}\) and 79.8 fb\({}^{-1}\) of data, the same benchmark scenarios are used as in the respective results.

Section 4 reports the prospects of a search for \(W^{\prime}\) bosons in final states with a top and a bottom quark. \(W^{\prime}\) bosons are also searched for in final states with an electron or muon and large missing transverse energy (\(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\)) in Section 5. Section 6 reports the results for \(Z^{\prime}\) bosons decaying leptonically into two electrons or muons. The exclusion and discovery mass limits are also computed for a hypothetic running at \(\sqrt{s}=13\) TeV and \(\sqrt{s}=15\) TeV as well as running at the high energy (HE) LHC assuming 15 ab\({}^{-1}\) of \(pp\) collisions taken at \(\sqrt{s}=27\) TeV. The HE-LHC is a possible future accelerator. The detectors are not yet designed but a similar physics performance is envisaged as for the HL-LHC detectors. Therefore, these studies will use the same parameterised estimates for the object performances and assume the same detector coverage as for the HL-LHC case. Finally Section 7 summarises previous results [21; 27] on a search for \(Z^{\prime}\) bosons decaying into a top anti-top quark pair in the \(t\bar{t}\to WbWb\to\ell\nu bqq^{\prime}b\) final state.

## 2 Monte Carlo samples

For each of the analyses presented in this note dedicated MC samples for \(\sqrt{s}=14\) TeV \(pp\) collisions were produced. The samples used for each of the analyses are summarised in Tables 1 - 3.

\begin{tabular}{l c c c c} \hline \hline Process & Generator & PS/Had & MC tune & PDF set \\ \hline \(W^{\prime}\to\ell\nu,\ell=e,\mu\) & Pythia8 & Pythia8 & A14 & NNPDF23LO \\ \(W\to\ell\nu,\ell=e,\mu,\tau\) & Powheg-Box & Pythia8 & AZNLO & CTEQ6L1 \\ \(Z/\gamma\to\ell\ell,\ell=e,\mu,\tau\) & Powheg-Box & Pythia8 & AZNLO & CTEQ6L1 \\ \(t\bar{t}\to\ell\nu\ell\nu\) & Powheg-Box & Pythia6 & A14 & NNPDF30NNLO \\ \(WW\to\ell\nu\ell\nu\) & Sherpa & Sherpa & default Sherpa tune & CT10 \\ \(WZ\to\ell\nu\nu\nu\) & Sherpa & Sherpa & default Sherpa tune & CT10 \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 2: Event generators used for the simulation of the signal and background processes used in the \(W^{\prime}\to\ell\nu\) search. The PS/Had column describes the program used for parton shower and hadronisation.

The \(W^{\prime}_{\rm R}\to t\bar{b}\) search is performed in the channel where the \(\rm W^{\prime}_{\rm R}\) decays into a top quark and a \(\bar{b}\)-quark, the top quark decays into a \(W\) boson and a \(b\)-quark, and the \(W\) boson decays in turn into a lepton and a neutrino, which is undetected and results in large \(E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}\). The productions of \(t\bar{t}\) pairs and \(W\)+jets are the dominant background processes. Single top quarks (\(t\)-channel, \(Wt\) and \(s\)-channel), \(Z\)+jets and dibosons (\(WW\), \(WZ\), and \(ZZ\)) production are also present in the signal regions. The \(W^{\prime}_{\rm R}\) signals were generated at leading order (LO) by MadGraph5_aMC@NLO v2.2.3[36, 37, 38, 39]. Samples of simulated signal events were rescaled to next-to-leading-order (NLO), calculated with ZTOP [40] and generated for signal masses between 1 and 7 TeV in steps of 1 TeV in mass. Simulated top-quark pair and single-top-quark processes were produced using the NLO Powheg-Box[41, 42] programme with the parton distribution function (PDF) set CT10 [43]. The parton shower and the underlying event were added using Pythia6 or Pythia8[44]. The background contributions from \(W\) boson production in association with jets were simulated using the MadGraph generator while the \(Z\) boson process was generated with Powheg. The production of vector-boson pairs (\(WW\), \(WZ\) or \(ZZ\)) with at least one charged lepton in the final state was simulated by the Powheg-Box generator in combination with Pythia8.

The main SM background in the \(W^{\prime}_{\rm SSM}\to\ell\nu\) search arises from processes with at least one prompt final-state lepton. Background MC samples were produced for the charged- and neutral current Drell-Yan (DY) production, as well as top-quark pair (\(t\bar{t}\)) and diboson production. The background samples were simulated for different ranges of the boson transverse mass (\(m_{\rm T}\)) to ensure that a large number of MC events is available across the entire \(m_{\rm T}\) region probed. The SSM signal \(W^{\prime}\to e\nu\) and \(W^{\prime}\to\mu\nu\) samples were generated at LO in QCD using the Pythia 8 event generator and includes off-shell production. Mass-dependent correction factors are applied to normalise the samples to the same mass-dependent NNLO pQCD calculation as used for the \(W\) background. Compared to the LO prediction using NNPDF2.3 LO, the corrections increase the cross-section by about 40% around a boson invariant mass of 1-2 TeV, and by about 10% at 5 TeV. Further EW corrections beyond QED final-state radiation (FSR) are not considered for the signal. The sample was produced providing a flat spectrum in \(W^{\prime}\) masses which is reweighted in the analysis to produce \(W^{\prime}\) signals for given masses. The backgrounds from \(W\to\ell\nu\), \(Z/\gamma^{*}\to\ell\ell\), \(W\to\tau\nu\), and \(Z/\gamma^{*}\to\tau\tau\) were simulated using the Powheg-Box v2 matrix-element calculation up to NLO in perturbative quantum chromodynamics (pQCD). The final-state photon radiation (QED FSR) was modelled by the Photos[45] MC simulation. The samples are normalised using the same prescription as used in the Run 2 \(\sqrt{s}=13\) TeV analysis [16] assuming higher order corrections to the cross-section at \(\sqrt{s}=14\) TeV are the same as at \(\sqrt{s}=13\) TeV. The normalisation is done as a function of the boson invariant mass to a next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) pQCD calculation using the numerical programme VRAP  which is based on Ref. [46] and the CT14NNLO PDF set [47]. In addition to the modelling of QED FSR, a fixed-order electroweak (EW) correction to NLO is calculated as a function of the boson mass with the Mcsanc[48, 49] event generator at LO in pQCD.

In the \(Z^{\prime}\to\ell\ell\) search the signal and background \(Z/\gamma^{*}\to\ell\ell\) event generation and normalisation to higher order cross-section predictions is done using the same methodology and assumptions as the \(W^{\prime}_{\rm SSM}\to\ell\nu\)

\begin{table}

search. The signal events were generated in LO with Pythia 8.186 and also includes off-shell production. \(Z/\gamma^{*}\to\ell\ell\) production is generated with Powheg-Box v2. The only difference with the samples used in the \(W^{\prime}_{\rm SSM}\to\ell\nu\) search is that the samples were produced in bins of \(m_{\ell\ell}\).

For the comparisons with running at \(\sqrt{s}=13\) TeV, the generator-level particles of the Run 2 simulated datasets were used and the parameterisations for the detector response are applied. These datasets use the same MC generator setups as the \(\sqrt{s}=14\) TeV datasets. The \(\sqrt{s}=15\) TeV projections use the \(\sqrt{s}=14\) TeV datasets which are renormalised by the cross-section ratio to the higher centre of mass energy. Signal and background events were also produced at \(\sqrt{s}=27\) TeV for the HE-LHC projections. As higher order corrections are not yet available, the LO predictions are used for the signal and NLO generator cross-sections for the DY background.

## 3 Event reconstruction

The detector response is emulated with a set of functions providing a parameterised response derived from fully-simulated event samples. These fully simulated samples were produced using the detector layout described in the ATLAS Technical Design Reports [19; 21; 23; 24; 25; 26] and assume an instantaneous luminosity of \(7.5\times 10^{34}\)cm\({}^{-2}\)s\({}^{-1}\), which corresponds to a pile-up scenario of 200 overlapping events (<\(\mu\)\(>\) = 200) [50] in each bunch crossing. The results of these studies were used to derive \(\eta\) and \(p_{\rm T}\)-dependent functions which are applied to the generator-level quantities to emulate the transverse energy and momentum resolutions as well as efficiencies and fake rates and also include a dedicated pile-up overlay library to add pile-up jets to a hard-scatter truth event. Functions are available for leptons, jets and \(E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}\). Parameterisations are also derived for the identification and misidentification for \(b\)-jets. Details on the performance are summarised in Ref. [51]. In general, the performance is found to be as good or even better as obtained with the current detector.

Similar to the analyses using 36.1 fb\({}^{-1}\) and 79.8 fb\({}^{-1}\) of data, overlaps between jets and leptons are being taken care of in the following way. If the jet closest to an electron candidate is within a cone of size \(\Delta R=\sqrt{(\Delta\eta)^{2}+(\Delta\phi)^{2}}=0.2\), that jet is removed from the event, as they most probably correspond to the same reconstructed object. If a remaining jet is found close to an electron within a cone of size \(\Delta R\) = 0.4, then the electron candidate is discarded. Selected muon candidates near jets that satisfy \(\Delta R\)(muon, jet) \(<0.04+10\) GeV\(/p_{\rm T}^{\mu}\) are rejected if the jet has at least three tracks originating from the primary vertex. Any jets with less than three tracks that overlap with a muon are rejected.

## 4 Search for \(W^{\prime}\) bosons decaying into a top and a bottom quark

### Analysis strategy

The \(\rm W^{\prime}_{R}\) boson search is performed in the channel where the \(\rm W^{\prime}_{R}\) decays into a top quark and a \(\bar{b}\)-quark, the top quark decays into a \(W\) boson and a \(b\)-quark, and the \(W\) boson decays in turn into a lepton and a neutrino, which is undetected and results in missing transverse momentum, \(\rm E_{T}^{\rm miss}\). The final-state signature consists of two \(b\)-quarks, one charged lepton (electron or muon) and \(\rm E_{T}^{\rm miss}\).

This analysis uses single lepton triggers. Events are selected containing at least one electron with \(p_{\rm T}>22\) GeV in \(|\eta|<2.5\) or at least one muon with \(p_{\rm T}>20\) GeV and \(|\eta|<2.65\). Selected electronscandidates satisfy the \(tight\) working point [52] requirements and are required to have \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>25\) GeV and a pseudorapidity, \(|\eta|\), smaller than 2.47. If the electron candidates fall in the calorimeter barrel-endcap transition region, \(1.37<|\eta_{\mathrm{cluster}}|<1.52\), the event is rejected. Similarly, muon candidates must meet the \(tight\) identification working point [53] requirements and have a transverse momentum \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>25\) GeV, with \(|\eta|<2.65\).

The dominant background processes are the production of \(t\bar{t}\) pairs and \(W\)+jets. Single top quarks (\(t\)-channel, \(Wt\) and \(s\)-channel), \(Z\)+jets and dibosons (\(WW\), \(WZ\), and \(ZZ\)) production also contribute to the background in the signal regions. They all modelled with MC simulated events. Instrumental background coming from misindentified electrons, referred to as the multijet background, is also present but it is very small and further suppressed by applying dedicated selections, and it will be neglected in the following. In the muon channel there is a requirement that \(\mathrm{E_{T}^{miss}}\)\(>\)30 GeV and also on the sum of \(m_{\mathrm{T}}^{W}\) and \(\mathrm{E_{T}^{miss}}\): \(m_{\mathrm{T}}^{W}\) + \(\mathrm{E_{T}^{miss}}>100\) GeV. In the electron channel the same requirement is applied and in addition the \(\mathrm{E_{T}^{miss}}\) threshold is raised to 80 GeV to further suppress the multijet background.

Starting from the baseline objects, \(W\) boson and top-quark candidates are reconstructed, and are used to define signal regions. The reconstruction of the \(\mathrm{W^{\prime}}\) candidate starts with the calculation of the \(z\) component of the neutrino momentum from the invariant mass of the lepton-\(\mathrm{E_{T}^{miss}}\) system with the constraint that the mass of \(W\) boson is 80.4 GeV. The constraint yields a quadratic equation and in the case of two real solutions, the smallest \(|p_{z}|\) solution is chosen. Two imaginary solutions are obtained if the transverse mass, \(m_{\mathrm{T}}^{W}\), of the reconstructed \(\mathrm{W}\) boson is larger than the mass of the \(W\)-boson used in the constraint. This can happen due to the resolution of the \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{miss}\). For these cases, the \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{miss}\) components are adjusted to satisfy \(m_{\mathrm{T}}^{W}=m_{\mathrm{W}}\), yielding a single real solution. The top-quark candidate is reconstructed by first choosing the jet among all selected jets in the event, which yields the invariant mass closest to the top-quark mass (\(m_{\mathrm{top}}=172.5\) GeV), and than adding the four-momenta of that jet and \(W\)-boson candidate. This jet is referred to as "\(b_{\mathrm{top}}\)", and may not be actually \(b\)-tagged. Finally, the four-momentum of the candidate \(\mathrm{W^{\prime}}\) boson is reconstructed by adding the four-momentum of the reconstructed top-quark candidate and the four-momentum of the highest-\(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) remaining jet (referred to as "\(b_{1}\)"). The invariant mass of the reconstructed \(W^{\prime}\to t\bar{b}\) system (\(m_{t\bar{b}}\)) is the discriminating variable of this search. The signal is searched for in the range from 0.5 TeV to 8 TeV. An event selection common to all signal regions is defined as: lepton \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>50\) GeV, \(p_{\mathrm{T}}(b_{1})>200\) GeV, \(p_{\mathrm{T}}(\mathrm{top})>200\) GeV. As the signal events are expected to be boosted, there is a requirement on the angular separation of the lepton and \(b_{\mathrm{top}}\): \(\Delta R(\ell,b_{\mathrm{top}})<1.0\).

The phase space is divided into eight signal regions (SR) defined by the number of jets and \(b\)-tagged jets, and are labelled as "\(X\)-jet \(Y\)-tag" where \(X=2,3\) and \(Y=1,2\), that are further separated into electron and muon channels. Figure 1 shows the signal selection acceptance \(\times\) efficiency (defined as the number of events passing all selection requirements divided by the total number of simulated simulated \(W^{\prime}\to t\bar{b}\to\ell\nu b\bar{b}\) events) as a function of the \(W^{\prime}_{\mathrm{R}}\) mass. The selection acceptance \(\times\) efficiency curves are shown separately for electron and muon channel, and also for their combination. The maximum signal acceptance \(\times\) efficiency is around 2 TeV and it decreases above that mass value due to decrease in the \(b\)-tagging efficiency and as the events become more boosted. The muon channel outperforms the electron channel due to overlap removal requirements, as they are relaxed by using a variable \(\Delta R\) cone size. The variable \(\Delta R\) cone size is not used for electrons because of the possible double counting of the energies of electron and jet.

### Systematic uncertainties

Systematic uncertainties are evaluated following the prescriptions used in the analysis [54] and then scaled according to the recommendations [51]. The uncertainty on the luminosity (1%) and on the theory cross sections (5% for diboson, 10% for \(Z\)+jets, and 3% for single top) are included in all the plots and for the calculations of expected limits and significances. The \(b\)-tagging and the modelling uncertainties (which are the dominant uncertainties on the shape of the discriminating variable from the previous analysis) are also included.

### Results

The presence of a massive resonance is tested by simultaneously fitting the templates of the signal and background simulated event samples using a binned maximum-likelihood approach (ML) based on the RooStats framework [55, 56, 57]. Each signal region is treated as an independent search channel.

The normalisations of the \(t\bar{t}\) and \(W\)+jets backgrounds were found to be different than one in the analysis of 36.1 fb\({}^{-1}\), therefore they are free parameters in the fit. They are constrained by Asimov dataset to one by construction. The other background normalisations are assigned Gaussian priors based on their respective normalisation uncertainties. The systematic uncertainties described in Section 4.1 are incorporated in the fit as nuisance parameters with correlations across regions and processes taken into account. The signal normalisation is a free parameter in the fit.

The expected event yields after the ML fit are shown in Tables 4 to 7 and correspond to an integrated luminosity of 3000 fb\({}^{-1}\).

The \(m_{tb}\) distributions for the SR after the ML fit are shown in Figures 2 and 3. An expected signal contribution corresponding to a \(W^{\prime}_{\rm R}\) boson with a mass of 2.0 TeV is shown as a dashed histogram overlay.

Figure 1: Signal selection acceptance \(\times\) efficiency in the signal regions as a function of the \(W^{\prime}_{\rm R}\) mass. It is defined as the number of events passing all selections divided by the total number of simulated \(W^{\prime}\to t\bar{b}\to\ell\nu b\bar{b}\) events. Acceptances \(\times\) efficiencies are shown for all SRs combined (full circle), electron channel (full square) and muon channel (full triangle).

The binning of the \(m_{tb}\) distribution is chosen to optimise the search sensitivity while minimising statistical fluctuations. Requirements are imposed on the expected number of background events per bin, and the bin width is adapted to a resolution function that represents the width of the reconstructed mass peak for each studied \(W^{\prime}_{\mathrm{R}}\) boson signal sample. This results in different number of bins in each region.

The limits are evaluated assuming a modified frequentist method known as \(\mathrm{CL_{s}}\)[58] with a profile-likelihood-ratio test statistic [59] and using the asymptotic approximation.

The 95% confidence level (CL) upper limits on the production cross section multiplied by the branching fraction for \(W^{\prime}_{\mathrm{R}}\to t\bar{b}\) are shown in Figure 4 as a function of the resonance mass. The expected exclusion limits range between 0.04 pb and \(2.3\times 10^{-3}\) pb for \(W^{\prime}_{\mathrm{R}}\) boson masses from 1 TeV to 5 TeV. The existence of \(W^{\prime}_{\mathrm{R}}\) bosons with masses \(m_{W^{\prime}_{\mathrm{R}}}<4.9\) TeV is expected to be excluded for the benchmark model for \(W^{\prime}_{\mathrm{R}}\), assuming that the \(W^{\prime}_{\mathrm{R}}\) coupling \(g^{\prime}\) is equal to the SM weak coupling constant \(g\). This would increase the current limit reported in Ref. [54] by 1.8 TeV.

The expected discovery significances is calculated using the profile likelihood test statistic for different mass hypotheses of the \(W^{\prime}_{\mathrm{R}}\) benchmark model for luminosity of 3000 fb\({}^{-1}\) in asymptotic approximation.

Based on \(5\sigma\) significance, it is found that \(W^{\prime}_{\rm R}\) with masses up to 4.3 TeV can be discovered.

## 5 Search for \(W^{\prime}\) bosons decaying into a lepton and missing transverse momentum

### Analysis Strategy

HL-LHC projections of a search for a new heavy, charged \(W^{\prime}\) boson decaying into an electron or muon and a neutrino are presented in this section. A high mass \(W^{\prime}\) signal would appear as an excess of events above the SM background at high \(m_{\rm T}\). The SM background mainly arises from processes with at least one prompt final-state lepton, with the largest source being the charged-current DY \(W\) boson production, where the \(W\) boson decays into an electron or muon and a neutrino. Other non-negligible contributions are from top-quark pair (\(t\bar{t}\)) and single-top-quark production, neutral-current DY (\(Z/\gamma^{*}\)) process, diboson production, and from events in which one final-state jet or photon satisfies the lepton selection criteria. This last component of the background, referred to in the following as the multijet background, receives contributions from multijet, heavy-flavour quarks and \(\gamma\) + jet production and is one of the smallest backgrounds in this analysis. It is evaluated in a data-driven way in the Run 2 analysis and cannot be yet reliably estimated from MC samples and is therefore not considered in this analysis. It was found to be negligible in the muon channel at \(m_{\rm T}\)\(>\) 3 TeV in the Run 2 analysis [16] based on 79.8 fb\({}^{-1}\) of \(pp\) collisions. In the electron channel, the contribution constitues around 10% of the overall cross section at \(m_{\rm T}\)\(\approx\) 3 TeV and mainly arises from jets misidentified as electrons.

Events are selected in a very similar way to the data analysis reported in Ref. [16]. Only events passing the single electron or muon triggers are considered. The single electron trigger selects events containing at least one electron with \(p_{\rm T}>22\) GeV in \(|\eta|<2.5\), while the single muon trigger requires a muon with \(p_{\rm T}>20\) GeV in \(|\eta|<2.65\). Events are required to contain exactly one lepton which can be either an

The theory prediction is also shown.

electron or a muon. In the muon channel, muons with \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>55\) GeV within \(|\eta|<2.65\) are selected which fulfil the criteria of the _high-\(p_{\mathrm{T}}\)_ working point [51]. In the electron channel, the electron must satisfy the _tight_ identification criteria, and the electron has \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>65\) GeV and has to lie in the rapidity region for precision measurements \(|\eta|<1.37\) or \(1.52<|\eta|<2.47\). These \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) thresholds are the same as in the Run 2 analysis and are motivated by the triggers which select events containing leptons with loose identification criteria and without isolation requirements. Though not applied in this analysis, such events will be needed for the data-driven background subtraction methods, as employed in Run 2, to work. The \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) thresholds for these "looser" triggers are not yet available and therefore in the following it is assumed the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) thresholds will be similar to those used in Run 2. The magnitude of \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\) must exceed 55 GeV (65 GeV) in the electron (muon) channel. Events in both channels are vetoed if they contain additional leptons satisfying loosened selection criteria, namely electrons with \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>20\) GeV satisfying the _medium_ identification criteria or muons with \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>20\) GeV passing the _loose_ muon selection.

The total acceptance times efficiency as a function of the \(W^{\prime}_{\mathrm{SSM}}\) pole mass is presented in Figure 5 for both the electron and muon channel. A value \(~{}83\%\) (68%) is reached around a pole mass of 2.5 TeV in the electron (muon) channel. For higher pole masses the acceptance times efficiency is falling again due to lower parton luminosities and reaches \(~{}65\%\) (60%) for pole masses between 6 and 10 TeV.

The resulting \(m_{\mathrm{T}}\) distribution is shown in Figure 6 for the expected background as well as for a possible SSM \(W^{\prime}\) boson with a mass of 6.5 TeV. The \(m_{\mathrm{T}}\) bins used in this figure is the binning used to compute the exclusion limits and the discovery reach in the following. The expected number of events in various \(m_{\mathrm{T}}\) bins are shown also in Table 8 for both the overall background and several \(W^{\prime}_{\mathrm{SSM}}\) signals.

### Systematics

The systematic uncertainties arise from both experimental and theoretical sources. The uncertainties found in the Run 2 analysis [16] increase for larger values of \(m_{\mathrm{T}}\). Therefore, in order to describe this increase as a function of \(m_{\mathrm{T}}\), the uncertainties are expressed as a percentage value multiplied by the value of \(m_{\mathrm{T}}\) given in TeV in the following. The values are derived from the uncertainties found in the TeV range in the Run 2 analysis. They are then scaled to more realistic values to be expected by the end of the HL-LHC following the recommendations given in Ref. [51].

Table 8: Expected event yields and their statistical uncertainties in the electron and muon channel in different \(m_{\mathrm{T}}\) intervals. For presentational purposes several of the \(m_{\mathrm{T}}\) bins used to compute the exclusion limits and the discovery reach are merged in larger bins in this table. The yields are given for the SM background (arising from charged and neutral current and top-quark production) and for \(W^{\prime}_{\mathrm{SSM}}\) bosons for three values of the pole mass.

Figure 6: Transverse mass distributions for events satisfying all selection criteria in the (a) electron and (b) muon channels of the \(W^{\prime}_{\mathrm{SSM}}\rightarrow\ell\nu\) search. The distributions in data are compared to the stacked sum of the main expected backgrounds. As an example, the expected signal distributions for a SSM \(W^{\prime}\) boson with a mass of 6.5 TeV is shown. The bin width is constant in \(\log\,m_{\mathrm{T}}\).

The experimental systematic uncertainties due to the reconstruction, identification and isolation of muons result in a value of \(2.5\%\times m_{\mathrm{T}}\) [TeV], while these uncertainties are negligible for electrons. Systematic uncertainties due to the energy resolution and scale are set to \(2.5\%\times m_{\mathrm{T}}\) [TeV]. The main systematic uncertainties in the \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\) calculation and on the jet energy scale are found to be negligible already in Run 2 and are therefore not considered in this analysis.

Theoretical uncertainties are related to the production cross-sections estimated from MC simulation. The effects when propagated to the total background estimate are significant for \(W\) and \(Z/\gamma^{*}\) production, and to some extent for top-quark production, but are negligible for diboson production. No theoretical uncertainties are considered for the \(W^{\prime}\) boson signal in the statistical analysis.

The largest uncertainties arise from the PDF uncertainty for the DY background, which is obtained from the 90% CL CT14NNLO PDF uncertainty set using VRAP to calculate the NNLO cross-section as a function of the boson mass. Rather than using the original 28 CT14 uncertainty eigenvectors, a re-diagonalised set of seven PDF eigenvectors, as provided by the authors of the CT14 PDF using MP4LHC [60, 61], is used. This sum is referred to as "PDF variation" in the following. An additional uncertainty arises from the choice of the nominal PDF set used. In Ref. [16], the central values of the CT14NNLO PDF set were compared to the MMHT2014 [62] and NNPDF3.0 [32] PDF sets. A comparison between these PDF sets showed that the central value for NNPDF3.0 falls outside the "PDF variation" uncertainty at large \(m_{\mathrm{T}}\). Thus, an envelope of the "PDF variation" and the NNPDF3.0 central value was formed, where the former was subtracted in quadrature from this envelope, and the remaining part, which is non-zero only when the NNPDF3.0 central value is outside the "PDF variation" uncertainty, is referred to as "PDF choice". In the electron channel one of the largest sources of uncertainty arises from the multijet background estimation. These uncertainties amount to around \(2.5\%\times m_{\mathrm{T}}\) [TeV] for the PDF choice and \(5\%\times m_{\mathrm{T}}\) [TeV] for the PDF variations. The uncertainties of the multijet background in the electron channel is assumed to be \(2.5\%\times m_{\mathrm{T}}\) [TeV]. Rounding up all of these systematics values gives an estimate of \(7\%\times m_{\mathrm{T}}\) [TeV] for each signal and channel. It should be noted that this search is limited by the statistic uncertainties as this search looks for a signal in the very high \(m_{\mathrm{T}}\) tail.

### Results

A statistical analysis is performed for the search for a \(W^{\prime}_{\mathrm{SSM}}\) boson using the \(m_{T}(\ell\nu)\) distribution in the electron and muon channels as the discriminant. Pole masses are tested in 1 intervals throughout the region of interest ranging from 2.5 to 11.5. The exclusion limits and discovery reach is interpolated between the two nearest mass points where necessary. This interpolation has a negligible effect on the accuracy of the result. For calculating the exclusion limits the same methodology is used as in the Run 2 analysis, where the limits are calculated in a Bayesian analysis [63]. The same statistical model implementation is used in the following for both the calculation of the exclusion limits and the discovery reach, the latter based on a profile likelihood ratio test assuming an asymptotic test statistic distribution [59]. The systematics are taken into account with a Gaussian prior, and the prior of the signal parameter of interest is Log Normal.

Assuming no signal is observed, exclusion upper limits on the cross-section for producing a \(W^{\prime}_{\mathrm{SSM}}\) boson times its branching ratio to only one lepton generation (\(\sigma\times BR\)) are computed at the 95% CL as a function of the \(W^{\prime}_{\mathrm{SSM}}\) boson mass. The exclusion limits use a uniform positive prior probability distribution for \(\sigma\times BR\). The expected upper limits are extracted using \(W^{\prime}_{\mathrm{SSM}}\) templates binned in \(m_{\mathrm{T}}\). The expected limits are derived from pseudo-experiments obtained from the estimated background distributions. The median of the distribution of the limits from the pseudo-experiments is taken as the expected limit, and \(1\sigma\) and \(2\sigma\) bands are defined as the ranges containing respectively 68% and 95% of the limits obtained with the pseudo-experiments.

The 95% CL upper limits on \(\sigma\times BR\) as a function of the \(W^{\prime}_{\rm SSM}\) mass are shown in Figure 7 for an integrated luminosity of 3000 fb\({}^{-1}\). The upper limits on \(\sigma\times BR\) for \(W^{\prime}\) bosons start to weaken above a pole mass of 5 TeV, which is mainly caused the combined effect of a rapidly falling signal cross-section towards the kinematic limit and the increasing proportion of the signal being produced off-shell and falling in the low-\(m_{\rm T}\) tail. It can be seen that \(W^{\prime}_{\rm SSM}\) bosons can be excluded up to masses of 7.6 (7.3) TeV in the electron (muon) channel. The limits in the electron channel are better as the calorimeter resolution is much better than the muon spectrometer one for very high-\(p_{\rm T}\) leptons. The combination of these two channels increases the limits to just over 7.9 TeV. This is an improvement of more than 2 TeV with respect to the current

The \(1\sigma\) (green) and \(2\sigma\) (yellow) expected limit bands are also shown. The predicted \(\sigma\times BR\) for SSM \(W^{\prime}\) production is shown as a black line. These limits are based on the theory NNLO cross-section including off-shell production.

exclusion limits using 79.8 fb\({}^{-1}\) of \(\sqrt{s}=13\) TeV of data. For comparison, assuming the performance of the upgraded ATLAS detector and a luminosity of 300 fb\({}^{-1}\), the combined \(W^{\prime}_{\rm SSM}\) boson masses up to 6.7 TeV can be excluded. Though the detector resolutions for the upgraded detector at the HL-LHC are applied, this is a good approximation of the reach with the current detector at the end of LHC Run 3.

The discovery reach is based on a \(5\sigma\) significance. It is found that SSM \(W^{\prime}\) bosons can be discovered up to masses of 7.7 TeV. The discovery reach is shown in Table 9 together with the exclusion limits discussed above. As can be seen, the discovery reach typically is only few hundred GeV lower than the mass limits obtained with a background-only hypothesis. The similarity of the values for the discovery reach and the exclusion limit is expected, as in the high-\(m_{\rm T}\) tail the background contribution approaches zero, while the number of signal events is around three. The expected reach with 300 fb\({}^{-1}\) of data will be 1.2 TeV lower assuming the same detector performance.

## 6 Search for \(Z^{\prime}\) bosons decaying to dilepton pairs

### Analysis Strategy

This section reports on HL-LHC projections of a search for a \(Z^{\prime}\) boson which would manifest as a narrow resonance through its decay, in the dielectron and/or dimuon mass spectrum. Exclusion mass limits and discovery reach in mass will be presented in the following. Besides looking at the mass limits using \(\sqrt{s}=14\) TeV \(pp\) collisions at the HL-LHC, results will be also given at \(\sqrt{s}=13\) TeV and \(\sqrt{s}=15\) TeV. This will give an idea on the impact of a 1 TeV change in centre of mass energy on the exclusion limits and the discovery reach. Furthermore the mass reach at the HE-LHC running at \(\sqrt{s}=27\) TeV and collecting 15 ab\({}^{-1}\) of data assuming the same physics performance and same detector setup as the upgraded ATLAS detector is presented. This scenario is only considered for the dielectron channel, as the performance in the dimuon channel is not representative with the upgraded ATLAS detector as the inner tracking detector for a \(\sqrt{s}=27\) TeV accelerator would be imbedded in a larger magnetic field to ensure a good momentum resolution for very high-\(p_{\rm T}\) tracks.

A \(Z^{\prime}\) signal would appear as an excess of events above the SM background at high dilepton invariant masses. This analysis considers two \(Z^{\prime}\) benchmark models: \(Z^{\prime}_{\rm SSM}\) bosons predicted by the SSM and \(Z^{\prime}_{\psi}\) bosons motivated by the models based on the E6 gauge group. In comparison to the benchmark \(Z^{\prime}_{\rm SSM}\) boson, which has a width of approximately 3% of its mass, the E6 models predict narrower \(Z^{\prime}\) signals with the \(Z^{\prime}_{\psi}\) boson having the smallest width which is 0.5% of its mass. The dominant source of background arises from DY production. Background from diboson (\(WW\), \(WZ\), \(ZZ\)) and top-quark production is not considered as their contribution to the overall SM background is negligible for dilepton invariant masses

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{c|c c} \hline \hline Decay & Exclusion [TeV] & Discovery [TeV] \\ \hline \(W^{\prime}_{\rm SSM}\to e\nu\) & 7.6 & 7.5 \\ \(W^{\prime}_{\rm SSM}\to\mu\nu\) & 7.3 & 7.1 \\ \hline \(W^{\prime}_{\rm SSM}\to\ell\nu\) & 7.9 & 7.7 \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}

In addition, the discovery reach for finding such new heavy particles is shown.

(\(m_{\ell\ell}\)) exceeding 2 \(\mathrm{TeV}\). This background is more pronounced at lower masses and was found to amount to around 10% (20%) of the total background for an invariant mass of 1 (300 ). In the dielectron channel, additional background arises from \(W\)+jets and multi-jet events in which at most one real electron is produced and one or more jets satisfy the electron selection criteria. While this background is negligible in the muon channel, it amounts to around 15% for \(m_{\ell\ell}>1\) after the event selection criteria in the Run 2 analysis [64] in the electron channel. The omission of this background and the tiny contribution from top-quark and diboson processes for large masses is covered by the systematic uncertainties and does not impact on the exclusion limits and the discovery reach.

Similar event selection criteria are applied as in the Run 2 analysis. Only events accepted by the single electron or muon trigger are considered. The single electron trigger requires at least one electron with transverse momentum \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>22\) in \(|\eta|<2.5\) or one muon with \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>20\) in \(|\eta|<2.65\) to be present in the event. In the offline analysis, exactly two same-flavoured leptons with \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>25\) within \(|\eta|<2.65\) (\(|\eta|<2.47\) excluding \(1.37<|\eta|<1.52\)) for muons (electrons) are required. The electrons and muons have to fulfil the _tight_ and _high-\(p_{T}\)_ identification working points, respectively.

The acceptance times efficiency after these selection cuts as a function of the \(Z^{\prime}_{\mathrm{SSM}}\) pole mass for collisions at the HL-LHC is very similar to the findings from Run 2 [17]. For running at the HE-LHC, the acceptance \(\times\) efficiency curve for the electron channel is displayed in Figure 8. The resulting dilepton invariant mass spectrum (using the binning which is used to compute the exclusion limits and the discovery reach) is shown in Figure 9 for the DY background as well as for an example \(Z^{\prime}_{\mathrm{SSM}}\) boson with a mass of 5 at the HL-LHC. The differences in the shapes of the reconstructed \(Z^{\prime}_{\mathrm{SSM}}\) signals in the electron and muon channels arise from the effects of the momentum resolution. Figure 10 shows the expected dielectron mass spectrum for the HE-LHC scenario. The differences in shape with respect to Figure 9 arise from the kinematics of the leptons from \(Z^{\prime}\) boson decay due to differences in the rapidity distribution. The expected event yields and their statistical uncertainties, in bins of invariant mass, are given in Table 10 for the dielectron and dimuon channel. The yields are shown separately for the SM DY background and three \(Z^{\prime}_{\mathrm{SSM}}\) signals.

### Systematics

The experimental and theoretical uncertainties assumed in this analysis are estimated from the Run 2 results [64]. These uncertainties will be smaller by the end of the HL-LHC running and the Run 2 values are scaled to more realistic values following the recommendations given in Ref. [51]. In the following, only the largest sources of uncertainties are considered. As the uncertainties vary with \(m_{\ell\ell}\), the uncertainties are expressed as a percentage value multiplied by the value of \(m_{\ell\ell}\) given in \(\mathrm{TeV}\), using the uncertainties reported in the \(\mathrm{TeV}\) range in the Run 2 analysis.

The experimental systematic uncertainties due to the reconstruction, identification and isolation of muons sums up to approximately \(2.5\%\times m_{\ell\ell}\) [\(\mathrm{TeV}\)]. Systematic uncertainties due to the energy resolution and scale are set to \(1.5\%\times m_{\ell\ell}\) [\(\mathrm{TeV}\)]. The uncertainties due to the resolution and reconstruction of the leptons will be added in quadrature to the dominant sources of theoretical uncertainties due to the choice of the PDF and the variation on the PDF. The uncertainties due to the choice of the PDF on the signal and the DY background are taken as \(2.5\%\times m_{\ell\ell}\) [\(\mathrm{TeV}\)] and the uncertainties due to any variation in PDF are assumed to be \(5\%\times m_{\ell\ell}\) [\(\mathrm{TeV}\)].

Overall these uncertainties add up to \(6.5\%\times m_{\ell\ell}\) [\(\mathrm{TeV}\)]. This search is looking for an excess in the high \(m_{\ell\ell}\) tail and therefore, as the \(W^{\prime}\) searches, it is limited by the statistic uncertainties.

### Results

The statistical analysis performed for this search uses the same Bayesian analysis is employed as in the \(W^{\prime}\to\ell\nu\) search presented in Section 5.3 and as used in the Run 2. As in the \(W^{\prime}\to\ell\nu\) search, pole masses are tested in 1 \(\mathrm{TeV}\) intervals in the mass region between 2.5 \(\mathrm{TeV}\) and 11.5 \(\mathrm{TeV}\) and the exclusion limits and discovery reach are interpolated between the two nearest mass points where necessary.

In case no signal is observed at the LHC or the HL-LHC, 95% CL exclusion upper limits can be set for producing a \(Z^{\prime}\) boson times its branching ratio to only one lepton generation (\(\sigma\times BR\)). The exclusion is performed for the \(Z^{\prime}\) boson models \(Z^{\prime}_{\mathrm{SSM}}\) and \(Z^{\prime}_{\psi}\). Exclusion limits are shown in Figure 11 assuming a

Table 10: Expected event yields for 3000 fb\({}^{-1}\) of \(\sqrt{s}=14\)\(\mathrm{TeV}\) collisions and their statistical uncertainties in the electron and muon channel in different mass intervals. For presentational purposes several of the mass bins used to compute the exclusion limits and the discovery reach are merged in larger bins in this table. The yields are given for the DY background and for \(Z^{\prime}_{\mathrm{SSM}}\) bosons for three values of the pole mass.

\(Z^{\prime}_{\psi}\) boson as benchmark.

The expected mass limits for the two \(Z^{\prime}\) models are also summarised in Table 11 and visualised in Figure 12. These exclusion limits will extend the current \(Z^{\prime}_{\rm SSM}\) (\(Z^{\prime}_{\psi}\)) mass limit of 4.5 (3.8)  obtained using 36.1 fb\({}^{-1}\) of data taken at \(\sqrt{s}=13\)  to 6.7 (6.1). Table 11 does not only show these expected lower limits on the pole mass for the two \(Z^{\prime}\) scenarios at the HL-LHC with \(\sqrt{s}=14\)  collisions, but also show the impact on these results if the collision energy would vary by \(1\). As can be seen, the lower limits on the pole mass would differ by 200-300. These exclusion limits are driven by the performance of the dielectron channel as the calorimeter resolution is much better than the muon spectrometer one for very high \(p_{\rm T}\) leptons.

In order to compare these findings with the expectations at the end of Run 3, the exclusion limits are also extracted for a luminosity of 300 fb\({}^{-1}\) of \(\sqrt{s}=14\)  collisions. Though the detector resolutions for the upgraded detector at the HL-LHC are applied, this is a reasonable approximation of the expectations with the current detector at the end of the LHC data-taking. At 95% CL \(Z^{\prime}_{\rm SSM}\) (\(Z^{\prime}_{\psi}\)) boson masses up to 5.4 (4.8) can be excluded.

The \(1\sigma\) (green) and \(2\sigma\) (yellow) expected limit bands are also shown. The predicted \(\sigma\times BR\) for \(Z^{\prime}_{\psi}\) production is shown as a black line. These limits are based on the theory NNLO cross-section including off-shell production. The blue marker shows the current limits obtained with the Run 2 analysis which is based on 36 fb\({}^{-1}\) of data.

Table 11 also shows the discovery reach for finding \(Z^{\prime}_{\text{SSM}}\) and \(Z^{\prime}_{\psi}\) bosons. As can be seen the \(Z^{\prime}\) discovery reach and exclusion mass limit differ by at most few hundred \(\GeV\). In some cases the difference is less than 100 \(\GeV\) and the reach given in the Table is the same as the exclusions limits as the numbers are rounded to a precision of 100 \(\GeV\). The similarity of these values is expected, as in the high-mass tail the background contribution approaches zero, while the number of signal events is around three. Compared to the results presented in Ref. [21] the discovery reach reported here is higher due to a change in how the reach is calculated. This is based on the shape of the signal and background \(m_{\ell\ell}\) distribution here while the \(5\sigma\) significance was calculated in a mass range between \(m(Z^{\prime})/2\) to infinity in Ref. [21].

The discovery reach and lower exclusion limits at 95% CL in mass are also calculated for a detector at the HE-LHC in the dielectron channel. This is done assuming the same physics performance as for the ATLAS detector at the HL-LHC. The exclusion limits and the discovery reach are summarised in Table 12. At the HE-LHC \(Z^{\prime}_{\text{SSM}}\) and \(Z^{\prime}_{\psi}\) bosons can be discovered up to 12.8 \(\TeV\) and 11.2 \(\TeV\), respectively, thus increasing their discovery reach by 6.5 \(\TeV\) compared the HL-LHC. In case \(Z^{\prime}\) bosons are not discovered yet, the HE-LHC will be able to further rule out \(Z^{\prime}_{\text{SSM}}\) and \(Z^{\prime}_{\psi}\) bosons up to 12.8 \(\TeV\) and 11.4 \(\TeV\), respectively. This corresponds to an increase of the discovery potential by a factor of two compared to the expectations at the HL-LHC.

## 7 Search for \(Z^{\prime}\) bosons decaying to a \(t\bar{t}\) pair

Besides these studies, the prospects for \(Z^{\prime}\) bosons in the \(t\bar{t}\) final state [27] were studied. Updated results using a more recent parameterisation of the \(b\)-tagging efficiencies and misidentification rates were shown in Ref. [21]. These studies used the event selection criteria and systematic uncertainty based on the Run 1 analysis [65] and a summary of the results of these studies without any further updates are given below.

The analysis looks for a narrow width \(Z^{\prime}\) boson searched for in a final state in which one of the \(W\) bosons from the top quark decays to two jets and the other decays to a lepton (electron or muon) and a neutrino (\(t\bar{t}\to WbWb\to\ell\nu bq\,q^{\prime}b\)). Events are required to contain exactly one lepton, several jets and at least a moderate amount of \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\) must be present. Events are separated into boosted and resolved channels with most of the signal events falling in the former category. In the resolved channel the decay products of the hadronic top-quark decay are reconstructed as three separate jets and in total events must contain at least four jets. In the boosted channel, the hadronic top-quark decay products are highly boosted and end up in one broad so-called large-R jet. Events are selected if at least one large-R jet and one jet (from the other top-quark decay) is present. Subsequently \(m_{t\bar{t}}\) is reconstructed based on the reconstruction of the \(W\) bosons and b-jets in the event. Using \(m_{t\bar{t}}\) as discriminant, upper limits were set on the signal cross-section times branching ratio as a function of the \(Z^{\prime}\) boson mass. Using as benchmark a Topcolour-assisted Technicolour \(Z^{\prime}_{\mathrm{TC2}}\) boson with a narrow width of 1.2%, \(Z^{\prime}_{\mathrm{TC2}}\) bosons can be excluded up to \(\simeq\) 4  with 3000 fb\({}^{-1}\) of pp collisions [21]. This mass limit is pessimistic, which is coming partly from the treatment of the systematic uncertainties which were taken from the Run 1 analysis [65]. These systematics are already smaller in the Run 2 analysis [66] and will be further reduced at the time of the HL-LHC. In particular the systematic uncertainty in the boosted channel are now reduced due to the significant improvements of the performance of boosted jets in Run 2 (in particular using more tracking information to look for sub-jets within the large-R jets). This gain in performance also improves the signal over background ratio. In addition, the usage of the top-tagger algorithm will help to further reject background.

## 8 Conclusion

This note summarises the prospects from four different searches for new heavy \(W^{\prime}\) and \(Z^{\prime}\) bosons at the HL-LHC, which is expected to run at \(\sqrt{s}=14\) and collect 3000 fb\({}^{-1}\)of data. These studies are based on MC simulations. To simulate the response of the upgraded ATLAS detector and pile-up collisions the MC truth information is convoluted with parameterised estimates to emulate the response of the upgraded ATLAS detector and pile-up collisions.

The first search uses as benchmark a right-handed \(W^{\prime}\) boson and looks at the \(W^{\prime}_{\mathrm{R}}\to t\bar{b}\to\ell\nu b\bar{b}\) final state. In case such particles are not discovered, they can be excluded up to masses of 4.9 at the HL-LHC. This increases the current limits based on 36 fb\({}^{-1}\)of LHC data by 2.5. Another search uses theboson as benchmark and studies the \(W^{\prime}\to\ell\nu\) final state. The lower exclusion limit at 95% CL on the \(W^{\prime}_{\rm SSM}\) pole mass is expected to improve from 5.6 \(\mathrm{Te\kern-1.0ptV}\) currently to 7.9 \(\mathrm{Te\kern-1.0ptV}\). If such particles exist they can be discovered up to \(W^{\prime}_{\rm SSM}\) masses of 7.7 \(\mathrm{Te\kern-1.0ptV}\). Though different benchmark models are used in these analyses, in case of a discovery the search for signals in different final states will help to unravel the underlying theory.

\(Z^{\prime}\) bosons are searched for in the dilepton final states as well as their decays into a \(t\bar{t}\) pair. \(Z^{\prime}_{\rm SSM}\) and \(Z^{\prime}_{\phi}\) bosons are expected to be discovered at the HL-LHC up to masses of 6.4 \(\mathrm{Te\kern-1.0ptV}\) and 5.7 \(\mathrm{Te\kern-1.0ptV}\). In case no signs for such particles are found, they can be excluded up to \(Z^{\prime}_{\rm SSM}\) (\(Z^{\prime}_{\phi}\)) masses of 6.5 \(\mathrm{Te\kern-1.0ptV}\) (5.8 \(\mathrm{Te\kern-1.0ptV}\)). In case the HL-LHC would run at \(\sqrt{s}=13\)\(\mathrm{Te\kern-1.0ptV}\) or \(\sqrt{s}=15\)\(\mathrm{Te\kern-1.0ptV}\) these numbers would decrease or increase by few hundred \(\mathrm{Ge\kern-1.0ptV}\). Searches for a \(Z^{\prime}\) predicted by a Topcolour-assisted Technicolour model in the \(t\bar{t}\to WbWb\to\ell\nu bq^{\prime}b\) final state were studied in Ref. [27]. If no \(t\bar{t}\) resonances are found such particles can be excluded up to masses of around 4 \(\mathrm{Te\kern-1.0ptV}\). This study based on the Run 1 results does not include the improvements in boosted jet reconstruction and the top tagger already available in Run 2 and these results therefore represent a very conservative estimate of the expected performance.
