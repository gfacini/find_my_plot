Example ATLAS tunes of Pythia8, Pythia6 and Powheg to an observable sensitive to \(Z\) boson transverse momentum

The ATLAS Collaboration

###### Abstract

New Pythia8, Pythia6, Powheg+Pythia8 and Powheg+Pythia6 tunes to an observable sensitive to \(Z\) boson transverse momentum are presented. They provide improved modelling of the transverse momentum spectrum of the Z boson, particularly at lower \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{Z}}\) values. Good agreement is found for comparisons to both LHC data and Tevatron data. For the first time tunes of the Powheg generator matched to Pythia8 and Pythia6 are presented. The tune of Powheg+Pythia8 is based on a configuration which properly accounts for the interplay between the minimum scale of the first parton radiated by Powheg and the kinematic limit of the initial state radiation shower in Pythia8.

Introduction

At the large center-of-mass energy of the LHC, production of electroweak (EW) scale objects (e.g. \(W\), \(Z\) and Higgs bosons, and top quarks) is often accompanied by QCD radiation. As this radiation can limit the measurement accuracy of the EW particles, a thorough understanding of it is essential for the LHC physics programme. QCD final state radiation (FSR) occurs whenever coloured partons are produced in the final state of the hard scattering. The Monte Carlo generators models for FSR are usually tuned to LEP data. QCD initial state radiation (ISR) however can only be addressed in collisions involving hadrons such as those produced at the Tevatron or at the LHC. The Drell-Yan process \(qq\to Z\to l^{+}l^{-}\), where \(l=e,\;\mu\), does not contain any coloured parton in the final state that can produce QCD final state radiation, and therefore provides a clean environment to study ISR.

In Monte Carlo generators, the \(Z\) boson produced in hadron collisions recoils against the initial state radiation and the proton remnants. The \(Z\) boson transverse momentum (\(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{Z}\)) is therefore an ideal observable for tuning the initial state radiation model parameters and the transverse momentum of the incoming partons, also called intrinsic or "primordial" \(k_{\mathrm{T}}\). The full \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{Z}\) range is sensitive to the shower evolution and can be used to tune the value of \(\alpha_{s}(M_{Z})\) for the initial state radiation, while the region \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{Z}\leq 20\) GeV is sensitive to the initial state radiation cut-off and to the intrinsic \(k_{\mathrm{T}}\).

Good modelling of the transverse momentum distribution of vector bosons produced in hadron collisions is of fundamental importance for the \(W\) and \(Z\) physics program at the LHC, including the measurement of the \(W\) mass, and the measurement of inclusive differential production cross sections of the \(W\) and \(Z\), which will be used to constrain parton distribution functions (PDF). The description of the low vector boson \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) region affects the determination of the acceptance of lepton \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) requirements in the event selection for Drell-Yan processes. One of the dominant uncertainties for the measurement of \(M_{\mathrm{W}}\) comes from such acceptance corrections, which are directly related to the modelling of low \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{W}\). Fine tuning of the ISR and primordial \(k_{\mathrm{T}}\) parameters can improve the modelling of \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{Z}\) and address the related model uncertainties in the \(W\)\(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) distribution. Using the same theoretical model for \(W\) and \(Z\) production, the estimation of the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{Z}\) uncertainty can be used to reduce the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{W}\) uncertainty, assuming the different initial state parton identities do not have a large effect on the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) spectra.

When the first vector boson \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) measurements from the LHC became available, the leading-order Pythia6[1] and Pythia8[2] Monte Carlo generators described the data reasonably well, while the Powheg\(+\)Pythia6 and Powheg\(+\)Pythia8 simulation [3, 4] showed significant disagreement at low \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\)[5]. Several attempts were made in Ref [6] to understand the source of this issue, which was not identified. Measurements of \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{Z}\) have also been performed by CDF [7, 8], DO [9, 10] and CMS [11, 12] at collider energies of 1.8 TeV, 1.96 TeV, 7 TeV and 8 TeV. The tunes presented here are based on the ATLAS \(Z\)\(\phi_{\eta}^{*}\) data at 7 TeV [13] which is of greater precision than the above mentioned measurements. \(Z\)\(\phi_{\eta}^{*}\) is an observable strongly correlated to \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{Z}\) and defined as \(\phi_{\eta}^{*}\equiv\tan(\phi_{\mathrm{acop}}/2)\cdot\sin(\theta_{\eta}^{*})\), where \(\phi_{\mathrm{acop}}\equiv\pi-\Delta\phi\), and \(\Delta\phi\) is the azimuthal opening angle between the two leptons, and the angle \(\theta_{\eta}^{*}\) is a measure of the scattering angle of the leptons with respect to the proton beam direction in the rest frame of the dilepton system 1. Monte Carlo predictions based on the new tunes are compared to vector boson \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) measurements at the Tevatron and the LHC, including previous ATLAS measurements of \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{Z}\)[5] and \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{W}\)[14], to test the compatibility of the measurements, as well as the universality of the model predictions for both \(W\) and \(Z\) production and for different collider energies.

Footnote 1: The angle \(\theta_{\eta}^{*}\) is defined as \(\cos(\theta_{\eta}^{*})\equiv\tanh[(\eta^{-}-\eta^{*})/2]\) where \(\eta^{-}\) and \(\eta^{*}\) are the pseudorapidities of the negatively and positively charged lepton, respectively

This study focuses on the tuning of initial state radiation and intrinsic \(k_{\mathrm{T}}\) parameters in the Pythia and Powheg\(+\)Pythia Monte Carlo generators using the ATLAS \(Z\)\(\phi_{\eta}^{*}\) measurement, in order to improve the description of the vector boson \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) distribution in the low \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) region. Four independent parameter sets are tuned for Pythia and Powheg\(\,\)r2314 interfaced to Pythia generators, using both the newer C++version, Pythia 8.176 and the older fortran version of Pythia 6.427. The new Pythia8 and Pythia6 tunes are named AZPHI, the Powheg\(+\)Pythia8 and Powheg\(+\)Pythia6 tunes are named AZPHINLO.

## 2 Tuning methodology

The tuning employs the Professor package [15] for the fit to the data and Rivet [16] for the implementation of the measurements. The method implemented in Professor permits the simultaneous tuning of several parameters by using an analytic approximation for the dependence of the physical observables on the model parameters. The analytic function for the generator response is implemented including parameter correlations. A polynomial of 4\({}^{\rm th}\) order is used for the Pythia8 and Powheg\(+\)Pythia8 tunes, and of 3\({}^{\rm rd}\) order for the Pythia6 and Powheg\(+\)Pythia6 tunes. The coefficients in the polynomial are obtained by fitting Monte Carlo predictions generated at a set of randomly selected parameter points, called anchor points. The number of anchor points used is 60 for 2-parameter tuning and 100 for 3-parameter tuning, with \(\sim\)10\({}^{7}\) events generated at each point. The optimal values of the model parameters are obtained with a standard \(\chi^{2}\) minimisation of the analytic approximation to the corresponding data using MINUIT [17]. The total experimental uncertainties are treated as uncorrelated and added to the Monte Carlo statistical uncertainties in the definition of the \(\chi^{2}\). After the tuning, Monte Carlo predictions used for the comparison with the measurements are generated using the optimal values of the parameters with \(\sim\)10\({}^{8}\) events.

The data set used to constrain the model parameters is the \(Z\)\(\phi_{\eta}^{*}\) cross section measured with 4.6 fb\({}^{-1}\) of data collected with the ATLAS detector at \(\sqrt{s}=7\) TeV [13]. The \(\phi_{\eta}^{*}\) differential cross section is measured in the kinematic region \(p_{\rm T}^{l}>20\,\mbox{GeV},|\eta^{l}|<2.4,66<M_{ll}<116\,\mbox{GeV},l=e,\ \mu\). The region used for the tuning is \(\phi_{\eta}^{*}\leq 0.29\), which corresponds to \(p_{\rm T}^{Z}\leq 26\) GeV. The tuning uses as input "dressed-level" leptons for the electron channel, and "bare-level" leptons in the muon channel. Dressed-level leptons are defined by recombining all radiated photons within \(\Delta R_{\gamma-l}<0.1\) with the lepton 4-momentum, while in the bare-level definition radiated photons are not recombined. The definition of electron dressing used in the corresponding Rivet analyses does not exactly match that used in the data: Rivet's definition includes all photons regardless of their origin, while the Monte Carlo definition used in the \(Z\)\(\phi_{\eta}^{*}\) data correction only includes photons from final state radiation in the \(Z\) boson decay. The effect of this mismatch was studied and found to be negligibly small for this tuning.

When changing ISR parameters, the overall energy and particle flow excluding the results of the hard scattering process, i.e. the underlying event, is also expected to change. Therefore, it is necessary to retune the generators to accurately describe the underlying event data. In the Pythia8 AZPHI tune and the Powheg\(+\)Pythia8 AZPHINLO tune the agreement, after tuning the ISR parameters, is restored by adjusting the multi-parton-interaction (MPI) cut-off to match the inclusive charged particle production and energy flow in \(Z/\gamma^{*}\) underlying event data measured by CMS at \(\sqrt{s}=7\) TeV [18].

The philosophy of this tune is to derive the optimised parameters from the Z \(\phi_{\eta}^{*}\) data which are currently the most precise published ATLAS data at \(\sqrt{s}=7\) TeVsensitive to modeling the low \(p_{\rm T}^{Z}\) region. To check the possible need for more observables to be included in the tune in order to guarantee universality, the optimised parameters obtained by the Professor tuning step are compared to ATLAS \(p_{\rm T}^{Z}\)[5] and \(p_{\rm T}^{W}\)[14] measurements at \(\sqrt{s}=7\) TeV, and to the D0 \(Z\)\(\phi_{\eta}^{*}\)[19], \(p_{\rm T}^{Z}\)[9, 10] measurements at \(\sqrt{s}=1.96\) TeV. A good description of these data was achieved, so the inclusion of more observables in the Professor tune was not considered to be necessary.

Both Pythia8 and Pythia6 versions provide a multitude of options to change modelling details. The tunes presented here use the following parameter values as a starting point:

* Pythia8 with the default settings, corresponding to Tune 4C [20];* Powheg for the calculation of the NLO matrix element interfaced to Pythia8 for the shower with settings as in Tune AU2-CT10 [21];
* Pythia6 with model settings as in ATLAS Tune AUET2B-CTEQ6L1[22];
* Powheg for the calculation of the NLO matrix element interfaced to Pythia6 with model settings as in the ATLAS Tune AUET2B-CT10;

## 3 Pythia8 and Powheg+Pythia8 results

Three parameters are tuned in Pythia8: primordial \(k_{\mathrm{T}}\), ISR \(\alpha_{s}(M_{\mathrm{Z}})\) and ISR \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) cut-off. The ISR cut-off in Pythia8 is implemented as a smooth turn-off parametrised as \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{2}/(\mathrm{pT}\mathrm{\theta}\mathrm{ref}^{2}+p_{\mathrm{T}}^ {2})\), in which the parameter \(\mathrm{pT}\mathrm{\theta}\mathrm{ref}\) corresponds to the point of steepest slope.

The Powheg samples used for the tuning of Powheg+Pythia8 are generated using the CT10 PDF set [23]. The value of the ISR \(\alpha_{s}(M_{\mathrm{Z}})\) is fixed to the value used in the Powheg matrix element calculation, which is the CT10 value of \(\alpha_{s}(M_{\mathrm{Z}})=0.118\). For the same reason, the running of \(\alpha_{s}\) in the ISR is set to NLO in order to match the behaviour of \(\alpha_{s}\) used in the Powheg matrix element calculation. Powheg events are a mixture of \(Z+0\) and \(Z+1\) jets, indeed below the Powheg hard emission \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) cut-off ptsqmin events are generated with no real radiation. Figure 1 shows the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{Z}\) distribution generated by Powheg with different values of ptsqmin 2, the events below the ptsqmin threshold do not have any radiation and hence all fall into the bin at \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{Z}=0\) GeV. In the default Pythia8 settings, Powheg events with no additional hard radiation are processed such that the parton showering is allowed to generate radiation up to the limit set by kinematic constraints. These kinematic constraints are that \(x_{1}x_{2}S=s\), where \(S\) and \(s\) are the collider and subprocess cms energies-squared respectively and \(x_{1},x_{2}\) are the longitudinal momentum fractions of the incoming partons of the Z production process. As a result the very low \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{Z}\) region between 0 and \(\sim 2\) GeV shows a \(\sim\)10% deficit with respect to the measurements. The choice of the default behaviour is based on the fact that Pythia is not aware of the context in which the Powheg events were generated. Therefore, \(Z+1\) jet events are recognised as already containing a hard QCD emission, whereas for \(Z+0\) jet events, Pythia assumes there is no hard emission associated to these events, and allows the shower to fill the phase space up to the kinematic limit, which clearly double counts the \(Z+1\) jet Powheg emission. The default behaviour of Pythia8 can be modified by setting the ISR generation to use the "wimpy" shower mode, so that the Powheg events with no additional radiation are showered to the limit set by the "SCALUP" value in the Les Houches file, which is set to \(\sqrt{\tt{ptsqmin}}\) for these events. The choice adopted to model the very low \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) region \(0<p_{\mathrm{T}}^{Z}\leq 2\) GeV is to raise the value of \(\tt{ptsqmin}\) in the Powheg generation from the default \(\tt{ptsqmin}=0.8\) GeV2 to \(\tt{ptsqmin}=4.0\) GeV2, which corresponds to \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{Z}=2.0\) GeV, and let the initial state radiation produce soft partons that fill the phase space up to the Powheg cut-off. Two parameters are left free in the tuning of Powheg+Pythia8: primordial \(k_{\mathrm{T}}\) and ISR \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) cut-off.

After the tuning of primordial \(k_{\mathrm{T}}\) and ISR parameters to the \(Z\)\(\phi_{\eta}^{*}\) measurement, the MPI cut-off is adjusted in both Pythia8 AZPHI and Powheg+Pythia8 AZPHINLO tunes to match the inclusive charged particle production and energy flow in \(Z/\gamma^{*}\) underlying event data measured by CMS at \(\sqrt{s}=7\) TeV [18].

Tables 1 and 2 show the tuning range and settings for Pythia8 AZPHI and Powheg+Pythia8 AZPHINLO tunes. In Figures 2 to 5, the Pythia8 and Powheg+Pythia8 predictions with the baseline tunes 4C and AU2-CT10 and the new AZPHI and AZPHINLO tunes are compared to the ATLAS \(Z\)\(\phi_{\eta}^{*}\)[13], \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{Z}\)[5] and \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{W}\)[14] measurements at \(\sqrt{s}=7\) TeV, and to the D0 \(Z\)\(\phi_{\eta}^{*}\)[19], \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{Z}\)[9, 10] measurements at \(\sqrt{s}=1.96\) TeV.

Figure 1: \(p_{\rm T}^{Z}\) spectrum as generated by Powheg before parton shower radiation. Different values of the ptsqmin emission cut-off are shown. For higher values of ptsqmin more events fall into the bin at \(p_{\rm T}^{Z}=0\) GeV. In the default Pythia8 settings, the events at \(p_{\rm T}^{Z}=0\) GeV are showered up to the kinematic limit, see text. In the wimpy shower mode, in events with \(p_{\rm T}^{Z}=0\) the parton showering is only allowed to generate additional radiation up to ptsqmin and to fill the phase space of the very low \(p_{\rm T}\) region \(0<p_{\rm T}^{Z}\leq\sqrt{\tt{ptsqmin}}\).

## 5 Conclusions

The ATLAS \(Z\)\(\phi_{\eta}^{*}\) cross sections measured with 4.6 fb\({}^{-1}\) of data at \(\sqrt{s}=7\)  have been used for the tuning of Pythia and Powheg\(+\)Pythia model parameters to achieve a good description of the \(W\) and \(Z\)\(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) spectra in the low \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) region. The new tunes describe the data both at the Tevatron and at the LHC. In the Pythia8 and Powheg\(+\)Pythia8 generators the multi-parton interaction cut-off have been retuned using the CMS \(Z\) underlying event data.
