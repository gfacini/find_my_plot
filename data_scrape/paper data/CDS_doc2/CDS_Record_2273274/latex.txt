## 1 Introduction

The AFP detector extends the physics reach of ATLAS by enabling the identification of protons that emerge intact and at low angles from LHC proton-proton collisions. Such processes are usually associated with diffractive scattering. The AFP detector consists of a high resolution pixel silicon tracker combined with a Time-Of-Flight system, placed at about 210 m from the ATLAS interaction point and at \(\sim\)3 mm from the LHC beam. The AFP detector has been installed in two steps. In the 2015-2016 shutdown, two Roman Pot stations equipped with 4 tracker planes each were placed on one side of the ATLAS interaction point. The full system containing detectors at both sides from the interaction point, each side consisting of two Roman Pots and timing detectors has been completed during the 2016-2017 shutdown.

In this note we present detector level uncorrected distributions with jets in the final state selected using the AFP detector as a proton tagger. The data sample was collected during a dedicated low pile-up LHC run in October 2016.

## 2 Experimental setup

The ATLAS detector [1] covers almost the whole solid angle1 around the collision point with layers of tracking detectors, calorimeters, and muon chambers. The ATLAS inner detector covers the pseudorapidity range \(|\eta|<2.5\). It consists of a silicon pixel detector, a silicon microstrip detector, and a straw tube tracker that also measures transition radiation for particle identification, all immersed in a 2 T axial magnetic field produced by a solenoid.

Footnote 1: The ATLAS experiment uses a right-handed coordinate system with its origin at the nominal interaction point (IP) in the center of the detector and the \(z\)-axis along the beam pipe. The \(x\)-axis points from the IP to the center of the LHC ring, and the \(y\)-axis points upward. The azimuthal angle \(\phi\) is measured around the beam axis, and the polar angle \(\theta\) is measured with respect to the \(z\)-axis. The transverse energy is defined as \(E_{\rm T}=E\) sin\(\theta\), the transverse momentum as \(p_{\rm T}=p\) sin\(\theta\), and the pseudorapidity as \(\eta=-\)ln[tan(\(\theta/2\))]. The rapidity is defined as \(y=0.5\times\ln[(E+p_{z})/(E-p_{z})]\), where \(E\) denotes the energy and \(p_{z}\) is the component of the momentum along the beam direction.

High-granularity lead/liquid-argon (LAr) electromagnetic sampling calorimeters cover the pseudorapidity range \(|\eta|<3.2\). The hadronic calorimetry in the range \(|\eta|<1.7\) is provided by a steel/scintillator-tile calorimeter, consisting of a large barrel and two smaller extended barrel cylinders, one on either side of the central barrel. In the endcaps (\(|\eta|>1.5\)), copper/LAr and tungsten/LAr hadronic calorimeters match the outer \(|\eta|\) limits of the endcap electromagnetic calorimeters. The LAr forward calorimeters provide both the electromagnetic and hadronic energy measurements, and extend the coverage to \(|\eta|<4.9\).

The ATLAS Forward Proton (AFP) detector [2; 3] is designed to measure protons leaving the interaction point intact and scattered at very small angles. The one arm AFP system consists of silicon tracker detectors [4] installed in two Roman Pot stations located at \(z=-205\) m (Near station) and \(z=-217\) m (Far station) from the center of the ATLAS detector, and it can be moved as close as \(\sim\)3 mm from the proton beam. The silicon tracker package housed on each station consists of 4 silicon 3D pixel detector planes, with 336\(\times\)80 pixels each and a pixel area of 50\(\times\)250 \(\mu\)m\({}^{2}\), compatible with the FEI4 readout chip [5; 6]. The detector planes are tilted by 14\({}^{\circ}\) towards the short pixel direction (\(x\) in LHC coordinate system) to enhance the hit efficiency and to maximize the 2-pixel cluster sharing in order to achieve a \(\sim\)6 \(\mu\)m single plane resolution along that axis. This is possible due to the 4-bit charge collection (Time-Over-Threshold) measurement available in the FEI4 chips. In addition, the sensors are staggered along the long pixel direction (\(y\) in LHC coordinate system) to improve the tracker position resolution along thevertical axis. The acceptance in proton relative energy loss (\(\xi\)) of the AFP detector has not been precisely determined at the time of writing this note, however, recent simulations based on the present knowledge of the optics predict that it is approximately \(0.02<\xi<0.1\).

The data were collected using an online two-level trigger system [7]. The AFP first level (L1) trigger requires events to have at least two hits in each of the AFP stations (i.e. a trigger signal from both Roman Pot stations). For some comparisons, the trigger relies instead on the L1 signals from the minimum-bias trigger scintillators (MBTS). The MBTS are positioned at each end of the detector in front of the liquid-argon end-cap calorimeter cryostats at \(z=\pm 3.56\) m. They are segmented into two rings in pseudorapidity and four (eight) sectors in azimuth in the inner (outer) ring and cover the range \(2.08<|\eta|<3.86\). The MBTS triggers are configured to require at least two sectors with signal above threshold from either side of the detector (i.e. one signal on each side or two signals in one side).

## 3 Object reconstruction

Leading protons in the AFP are identified via the presence of a single cluster of hits, in at least five out of the seven planes 2. The clustering of the hits in the AFP planes is performed by grouping neighbouring pixels and calculating the center-of-gravity weighted by the Time-Over-Threshold information (see Sec. 2) to determine its position. No accurate measure of the proton kinematics is available at this time due to a limited knowledge of the beam-optics and the alignment of the AFP stations. Hence, the fraction of the proton momentum participating in the hard interaction is estimated using calorimeter information in the ATLAS central detector using the expression

Footnote 2: One tracker plane was not operational due to a failure in the high voltage line.

\[\xi_{\rm cal}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{s}}\sum_{i}p_{\rm T}^{i}e^{-\eta_{i}}, \tag{1}\]

where the sum runs over all the calorimeter clusters with \(p_{\rm T}\) above 200 MeV, similar to previous measurements [8]. The minus sign in front of \(\eta\) appears because the tagged proton in the installed AFP arm is on the \(z<0\) side of ATLAS. The \(\xi_{\rm cal}\) variable provides the means to separate diffractive from non-diffractive events.

Jets are reconstructed from energy deposits in the calorimeters using the anti-\(k_{t}\) jet algorithm [9] with the radius parameter set to 0.4. The measured jet transverse momentum is corrected for detector effects, including the non-compensating character of the calorimeter, by weighting energy deposits arising from electromagnetic and hadronic showers differently. In addition, jets are corrected for contributions from pile-up, as described in Ref. [10]. Jets with corrected \(p_{\rm T}>20\) GeV and \(|\eta|<3.0\) are considered in the analysis.

In order to suppress jets originating from pile-up collisions, for central jets (\(|\eta|<2.4\)) with \(p_{\rm T}<60\) GeV a significant fraction of the tracks associated with each jet must have an origin compatible with the primary vertex (see Sec. 4), as defined by the jet-vertex-tagger (JVT) [11]. Similarly, topological correlations in dijet events are employed to extrapolate the JVT information beyond the coverage of the inner detector and suppress jets originating from pile-up in the forward region (\(|\eta|>2.5\)) for jets with \(p_{\rm T}<50\) GeV, as discussed in Ref. [12].

## 4 Event selection

The data sample considered for this note was collected in October 2016 using a special LHC beam configuration such that the average number of interactions per beam crossing was limited to \(\mu\sim 0.3\) with the standard LHC optics (\(\beta^{*}=0.4\) m).

A data sample with tagged protons was selected using a trigger that requires events with at least 4 AFP hits (at least two per station) and at least one jet in the calorimeter with \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>10\) GeV. Events are required to have a single reconstructed primary vertex consistent with the beamspot envelope and to contain at least two associated tracks of \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>0.1\) GeV. Events with multiple reconstructed primary vertices are rejected. Events with at least five AFP tracker planes with one cluster each and at least one jet in the calorimeter with \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>20\) GeV and \(|\eta|<3.0\) are required. Finally, events are rejected if they contain any identified pile-up jet (see Sec. 3), which rejects 10% of the events with at least one jet of \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>20\) GeV and \(|\eta|<3.0\) and one primary vertex. The selected samples consist of 626,103 events.

In addition, a separate sample was collected using a minimum bias (MB) trigger, based on the presence of 2 hits in the MBTS, and a jet of \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>10\) GeV in the final state. This latter sample is dominated by non-diffractive events (see below). The same requirements on the primary vertex and jets in the final state are applied. A total of 242,878 events are selected.

## 5 Results

The position of the particle hit clusters in one AFP tracking plane (see Sec. 3) is shown in Fig. 1. The structure with the highest multiplicity is a consequence of the LHC beam optics. The hit distributions are compatible with previous simulation studies [2].

Figure 1: The (\(x\), \(y\))-distribution of AFP clusters in a plane of the Near station (\(z=-205\) m) for events with a jet satisfying \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>20\) GeV and \(|\eta|<3.0\) in the final state. The positions of the clusters are in pixel units (i.e. 50\(\times\)250 \(\mu\)m\({}^{2}\)).

The measured uncorrected \(\xi_{\rm cal}\) distributions at the detector level in the selected data samples, using either AFP or MBTS triggers, are presented in Fig. 2. The AFP-triggered data sample exhibits a double peak structure dominated by diffractive processes at low \(\xi_{\rm cal}\) and non-diffractive processes at large \(\xi_{\rm cal}\). This is understood in terms of pile-up effects in which a non-diffractive process overlaps with diffractive processes or beam-halo particles giving signal in the AFP. The presence of a low \(\xi_{\rm cal}\) peak indicates that AFP triggers are correlated to diffractive events in the central detector. A very low \(\xi_{\rm cal}\) tail is observed due to the smearing of the variable with respect to the truth \(\xi\) (see [8]).

The MB-triggered distribution is normalized to match the AFP data at the observed peak at large \(\xi_{\rm cal}\), which allows for a shape comparison and an approximate estimation of the size of the background contribution under the diffractive peak at low \(\xi_{\rm cal}\). The normalized MB-triggered distribution provides a good description of the large \(\xi_{\rm cal}\) region.

Figure 3 shows the correlation between the \(x\)-position of the clusters in the first plane of the Near station and the measured \(\xi_{\rm cal}\) of the event from the AFP-triggered data. Two different populations are observed. For low \(\xi_{\rm cal}\) values, a clear \(x-\xi_{\rm cal}\) correlation is observed, indicating the presence of diffractive events. This correlation is a consequence of the effect of the LHC machine dipoles and quadrupoles modifying the position of the leading protons according to their energy (and therefore, as a function of \(\xi_{\rm cal}\)). On the contrary, for the population at larger \(\xi_{\rm cal}\) values, there is no such correlation, confirming that the events in this region are due to pile-up effects.

Another signature of diffractive processes is the presence of large rapidity gaps in the detector. Figure 4 shows the uncorrected normalized forward rapidity gap \(\Delta n_{z<0}^{F}\) distributions at the detector level for the AFP and MB trigger data sets. \(\Delta n_{z<0}^{F}\) is defined as the difference between the pseudorapidity of the most forward calorimeter cluster or track with \(p_{\rm T}>200\) MeV and the edge of the calorimeter acceptance at \(\eta\sim-4.9\) (in the direction of the AFP detector). In this way, an event with no calorimeter activity or track in the region \(-4.9<\eta<-1.9\) would translate into a rapidity gap of \(\Delta n_{z<0}^{F}=3\). The \(\Delta n_{z<0}^{F}\) distribution for the AFP-triggered data shows a more prominent tail towards large values compared to that of the MB data, indicating that the AFP-triggered sample is enriched in diffractive processes compared with the MBTS sample.

Figure 2: Measured \(\xi_{\rm cal}\) distribution in AFP and MB selected data samples on linear (left) and logarithmic (right) scale, for events with at least one jet with \(p_{\rm T}>20\) GeV and \(|\eta|<3.0\). The MB data is normalized to the AFP data in the large \(\xi_{\rm cal}\) region.

## 6 Conclusions

This note presents detector level distributions of events with jets in the final state from a special low pile-up run taken in October of 2016 selected using the AFP detector as a proton tagger.

The proton relative energy loss reconstructed from the ATLAS calorimeter (\(\xi_{\rm cal}\)) exhibits a double peak structure when the AFP detector is used to select events. The low \(\xi_{\rm cal}\) peak is compatible with the expected behaviour of proton-tagged diffractive events. In addition, a clear correlation between \(\xi_{\rm cal}\) and the proton position measured in the AFP detectors is present. Similarly, an excess of the AFP-triggered events with large rapidity gaps over the sample dominated by non-diffractive processes was observed. We conclude that the proton tagging in the AFP detector enriches the data in diffractive processes as expected.

Figure 3: 2D distribution of the \(x\)-position of the pixel in one of the AFP stations (Near station, \(z=-205\) m) as a function of the measured \(\xi_{\rm cal}\) in the ATLAS calorimeter for events with AFP clusters and a jet with \(p_{\rm T}>20\) GeV and \(|\eta|<3.0\) in the final state, from the AFP-triggered data.

In the beginning of 2017 the installation of the full AFP was successful, which not only added two Roman Pot stations on the A-side of ATLAS, but also added a Time-of-Flight (ToF) detector in the Far stations. With the new ToF detector the background is expected to be further reduced e.g. discriminating events where the time of arrival of the proton is not consistent with the position of the primary vertex.
