## 1 Introduction

The vector boson scattering (VBS) process is crucial for probing the mechanism of electroweak symmetry breaking in the Standard Model. At the LHC, the VBS process has been studied through the measurements of EW production of two vector bosons plus two jets (EW-VVjj). Evidence of the production of EW-VVjj processes at the LHC was seen by the ATLAS collaboration with 20.3 fb\({}^{-1}\) integrated luminosity of \(\sqrt{s}=8\) TeV pp collision data [1], where a 3.6 \(\sigma\) excess was observed in the data over the background-only prediction. A 2.0 \(\sigma\) excess was observed by the CMS collaboration with 19.4 fb\({}^{-1}\) integrated luminosity of \(\sqrt{s}=8\) TeV pp collision data [2]. In Run II, observations of the EW-VVjj processes have been reported by both the ATLAS and CMS collaborations in the same-sign \(WW\) channel [3, 4]. In the \(WZ\) channel, results were reported recently by both the ATLAS and CMS collaborations [5, 6]. With more data collected, evidence of the EW-VVjj processes with the \(ZZ\) final states (EW-ZZjj) also becomes possible. A recent publication from the CMS collaboration with 35.9 fb\({}^{-1}\) of data at 13 TeV [7] reported an observed (expected) significance of 2.7 (1.6) \(\sigma\) of the EW-ZZjj process in the \(\ell\ell\ell\ell\) (\(\ell=e,\mu\)) final state. The \(ZZ\) channel will benefit significantly from the increased luminosity at the high-luminosity LHC (HL-HLC).

In this note, a prospect study has been performed for the EW-ZZjj process at the HL-LHC in the \(\ell\ell\ell\ell\) channel with the ATLAS detector. The VBS topology consists of two high-energy jets in the back and forward regions, with two vector bosons. Both the EW and QCD processes give the same final state, and the QCD VVjj process is the dominant background.

This study uses 3000 fb\({}^{-1}\) of simulated pp collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 14 TeV, expected to be recorded by the ATLAS detector. Simulated events were produced at generator level. The detector effects of lepton and jet reconstruction and identification were estimated by corrections, assuming the mean number of interactions per bunch crossing of 200. The expected significance of the electroweak production has been studied, as well as the precision of the expected measurements of differential cross sections as a function of the dijet or \(ZZ\) invariant mass.

## 2 The ATLAS detector at the HL-LHC

The new Inner Tracker (ITk) [8] will extend the ATLAS tracking capabilities to pseudorapidity (\(|\eta|\)) up to 4.0. The upgraded Muon Spectrometer [9] at the HL-LHC, where a forward muon tagger is included, will also provide lepton identification capabilities to \(|\eta|\) up to 4.0. The new high granularity timing detector (HGTD) [10] designed to mitigate the pile-up (PU) effects is also foreseen in the forward region of \(2.4<|\eta|<4.0\). The expected performance of the upgraded ATLAS detector has been studied at the HL-LHC as reported in Ref. [11].

## 3 Simulation

The analysis is performed using particle-level events of the signal and background processes. The samples are generated at 14 and with a fast simulation based on the parametrization of the ATLAS detector at HL-LHC [11].

Both the EW-ZZjj and QCD-ZZjj processes with the \(ZZ\to\ell\ell\ell\ell\) decays are modelled using Sherpa 2.2.2[12] with the NNPDF3.0NNLO [13] PDF set. Those samples are generated inclusively with \(\ell\ell\ell\ell\) plus two jets, where hadronic decay of vector bosons are included. The analysis selections are optimized to enhance the EW-ZZjj processes.

The signal sample is generated with two jets at Matrix Element (ME) level. The background process of \(pp\to\ell\ell\ell\ell\)+ n partons is modelled with next-to-leading order (NLO) QCD accuracy for events with up to one outgoing parton and with leading order (LO) accuracy for the case with two and three partons, in a phase space of \(m_{\ell\ell}>4\) and at least two leptons with \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>5\).

Other backgrounds, such as irreducible ones from triboson and contributions with misidentified or non-prompt leptons, have minor contributions to the \(\ell\ell\ell\ell\) channel and therefore are not included in this analysis.

In addition to hard scattering events, pile-up collisions are included with a mean number of interactions per bunch crossing of 200, and the impact is included in the reconstruction for each physics object used in this analysis: electrons, muons and jets.

Signal and background yields are scaled to an integrated luminosity of 3000 fb\({}^{-1}\) for this study.

## 4 Event selections and phase space definition

The analysis selection is based on the Run-II analysis [14] and has been modified according to the expected changes in the ATLAS detector at the HL-LHC, which includes lepton identification in the forward region up to \(|\eta|\) = 4.0.

Candidate events are selected with exactly four leptons (electrons or muons), consistent with the decays from two on-shell \(Z\) bosons. The VBS topology is enhanced by requiring at least two jets with large invariant mass and \(\eta\) separation. Detailed selection criteria are summarized below:

* Exactly four leptons with \(p_{T}^{\ell}>\) 20, 20, 10 and 7, and \(|\eta|<\) 4.0.
* Two \(Z\) candidates, minimizing \(|m_{Z_{1}}-m_{Z_{PDG}}|+|m_{Z_{2}}-m_{Z_{PDG}}|\), where \(m_{Z_{PDG}}\) refers to the \(Z\) mass value from PDG [15]. The candidate with the dilepton mass closest to \(m_{Z_{PDG}}\) is labelled as \(Z_{1}\), while the other one as \(Z_{2}\).
* \(60<m_{Z_{1}}<120\) and \(60<m_{Z_{2}}<120\).
* \(m_{\ell^{+}\ell^{-}}>10\) for all the same-flavour opposite-sign lepton pairs.

* PU jet suppression is applied for all PU jets in the region of \(|\eta|<3.8\), based on the expected ATLAS detector performance at the HL-LHC.
* At lease two candidate jets satisfying \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>30\) GeV with \(|\eta|<3.8\) or \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>70\) GeV with 3.8 \(<|\eta|<4.5\), and not overlapping with any of the four leptons within a cone in the \(\phi-\eta\) space \(\Delta R(\ell,j)<0.2\).
* Two leading-\(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) jets (denoted as \(j_{1}\) and \(j_{2}\)) satisfying \(\eta^{j_{1}}\times\eta^{j_{2}}<0\).
* \(m_{jj}>600\) GeV and \(|\Delta\eta(jj)|>2\).

In addition, a fiducial phase space is defined at generator level with the same kinematic selections as listed above, and it is used to study the expected precision of the cross-section measurements.

The numbers of selected signal and background events are summarized in Table 1, normalized to 3000 fb\({}^{-1}\) data. In addition to the baseline selection listed above, two alternative selections are also studied to compare different detector scenarios at the HL-LHC. The first one, with the lepton \(|\eta|\) cut being limited to 2.7, is used to understand the improvement due to forward lepton reconstruction and identification with the upgraded ATLAS detector. The second one, with the PU jet suppression being only applicable up to \(|\eta|=2.4\), is deployed to see the benefit from extending the rejection range of PU jets at the HL-LHC. The extended tracking coverage improves the lepton detection efficiency and can increase the number of events with \(\ell\ell\ell\) and two jets in the final state by 15 to 30%, providing larger event yield for differential cross-section measurements. However, the overall significance of observing the EW-ZZjj process does not improve as much, due to larger increase of the QCD-ZZjj background contribution. This is an effect of the \(ZZ\) system from EW processes being more centrally produced than the \(ZZ\) system from QCD processes, as shown in Figure 1, where the distributions of the events as a function of the centrality variable is shown for both EW and QCD processes. The centrality of the \(ZZ\) system is defined as

\[ZZ\ \mathrm{centrality}=\frac{|y_{ZZZ}-(y_{j1}+y_{j2})/2|}{|y_{j1}-y_{j2}|} \tag{1}\]

The distributions of the dijet invariant mass (\(m_{jj}\)), the \(ZZ\) invariant mass (\(m_{ZZZ}\)) and the \(\phi\) separation of two \(Z\) bosons (\(|\Delta\phi(ZZ)|\)), after the event selection and normalized to 3000fb\({}^{-1}\), are also shown in Figure 1.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|} \hline Selection & \(N_{\mathrm{EW-ZZjj}}\) & \(N_{\mathrm{QCD-ZZjj}}\) & \(N_{\mathrm{EW-ZZjj}}\) / \(\sqrt{N_{\mathrm{QCD-ZZjj}}}\) \\ \hline Baseline & 432 \(\pm\) 21 & 1402 \(\pm\) 37 & 11.54 \(\pm\) 0.58 \\ \hline Leptons with \(|\eta|<2.7\) & 373 \(\pm\) 19 & 1058 \(\pm\) 33 & 11.46 \(\pm\) 0.62 \\ \hline PU jet suppression only in \(|\eta|<2.4\) & 536 \(\pm\) 23 & 15470 \(\pm\) 120 & 4.31 \(\pm\) 0.19 \\ \hline \end{tabular}

Uncertainties in the table refer to expected data statistical uncertainty at 14 TeV with 3000 fb\({}^{-1}\).

## 5 Systematics

The dominant systematics for \(\ell\ell\ell\ell\) channel are from theoretical modelling of the QCD-ZZjj background processes.

For theoretical sources, different sizes of systematics have been tested, at 5, 10 and 30% level on the background modelling. The 30% uncertainty is a conservative estimation from direct calculation by comparing different choices of PDF sets and QCD renormalization and factorization scales, following recommendation from PDF4LHC [16]. The uncertainty is driven by the QCD scale choices. The 5% one is an optimistic estimation where enough data events from QCD enriched control region at the HL-LHC could be used to provide constrain on the theoretical modelling of QCD-ZZjj processes.

For the experimental sources, the jet uncertainties have been checked following the studies in Ref. [11] and effect is within fluctuation of the simulated events, which is at 5% level. Thus, 5% uncertainty is used as a conservative estimate of the experimental uncertainties.

The final results largely rely on theoretical modelling of QCD-ZZjj background processes, thus results are presented under different conditions: the case with statistical uncertainty only, the case with statistical and experimental uncertainties, and the cases with additional theoretical uncertainties of 5, 10 and 30%. Statistical, experimental and theoretical uncertainties are treated as uncorrelated and summed up quadratically.

## 6 Results

The expected significance of EW-ZZjj production processes is calculated as

\[\text{Significance}=\frac{S}{\sqrt{\sigma(B)^{2}_{stat.}+\sigma(B)^{2}_{syst.}}}, \tag{2}\]

where \(S\) denotes the number of signal events after selections, and \(\sigma(B)_{stat.}\) and \(\sigma(B)_{syst.}\) refer to the statistical and systematic uncertainties from background processes. Statistical uncertainty is estimated from expected data yield at 14 TeV with 3000 fb\({}^{-1}\).

A scan over different \(m_{jj}\) cuts is performed and the result is shown in Figure 2 for luminosity of 3000 fb\({}^{-1}\). The scan is done from 600 GeV to 1.5 TeV, with a 50 GeV step.

The significance could be further improved with multivariate analysis techniques in the future.

In addition, the expected differential cross-section measurements of the EW-ZZjj processes at 14 TeV have been studied in the defined phase space, as a function of \(m_{jj}\), and \(m_{ZZ}\), as shownin Figure 3. The expected differential cross-section measurements are calculated bin by bin, following the equation

\[\sigma=\frac{N_{pseudo-data}-N_{QCD-ZZjj}}{L*C_{EW-ZZjj}},\ C_{EW-ZZjj}=\frac{N_{ EW-ZZjj}^{det.}}{N_{EW-ZZjj}^{part.}}, \tag{3}\]

where \(N_{pseudo-data}\) is the expected number of data events with 3000 fb\({}^{-1}\) luminosity, and \(N_{QCD-ZZjj}\) and \(N_{EW-ZZjj}\) are the number of predicted events from QCD-ZZjj and EW-ZZjj processes, respectively. The \(C_{EW-ZZjj}\) factor refers to the detector efficiency for EW-ZZjj processes, calculated as number of selected signal events at detector level (\(N_{EW-ZZjj}^{det.}\)), divided by number of selected events at particle level in the fiducial phase space (\(N_{EW-ZZjj}^{part.}\)). The interference between EW-ZZjj and QCD-ZZjj processes is at a few percent level and is ignored.

Both the statistical only case (statistical uncertainty is estimated from expected data yield at 14 TeV with 3000 fb\({}^{-1}\)) and the ones with different sizes of theoretical uncertainties on the background modelling are shown in Figure 3.

Table 2 shows the expected cross-section measurement in the phase space described at Section 4 for 3000 fb\({}^{-1}\), with the statistical only case, and the cases with different sizes of theoretical uncertainties. The statistical uncertainty is at 10% level and the integrated cross-section measurement becomes dominated by experimental and modelling uncertainty on the QCD-ZZjj background. For the possible extension of the HL-LHC run to 4000 fb\({}^{-1}\), the statistical uncertainty will be further reduced to 8% level.

The statistical uncertainty is estimated from expected data yield at 14 TeV with 3000 fb\({}^{-1}\). Different uncertainties are summed up quadratically.

## 7 Conclusion

The prospect study for the VBS \(ZZ\) at the HL-LHC in the four-lepton channel, using 3000 fb\({}^{-1}\) simulated pp collision at a centre-of-mass energy of 14 TeV has been presented. With a simplified cut-based analysis, the expected significance of the electroweak production has been shown, as well as the precision of the expected measurements of the integrated cross section and differential cross sections as a function of dijet or \(ZZ\) invariant mass. Under the assumption of theoretical uncertainty being constraint at 5% level for the QCD-ZZjj processes, the observation of the EW-ZZjj process can be reached with a significance of 7 \(\sigma\). This is expected to be improved with multivariate analysis techniques in the future. For the integrated cross-section measurements of EW-ZZjj processes, the precision could reach at 20% level with the assumption of 5% theoretical uncertainty on the QCD-ZZjj processes. In the case of 30% theoretical uncertainty, the precision would be 100%.
