Introduction

It is well known that the \(H\to\gamma\gamma\) decay mode is the most promising way to detect a Standard Model Higgs boson at the LHC for a Higgs mass \(m_{H}\) in the range \(80<m_{H}<130\) GeV [1].

The observability of this channel is subject, however, to the detector capability of rejecting the large background of \(\gamma\)-jet and jet-jet events, in which one or two jets are misidentified as photons, which is eight orders of magnitude larger than the signal cross-section. To reduce this background to a level of \(\sim\)20% of the irreducible background consisting of genuine \(\gamma\gamma\) pairs, highly segmented electromagnetic (EM) and hadronic calorimetry is needed.

This however is not enough. Figure 1 shows the ratio of the jet background to the irreducible \(\gamma\gamma\) continuum after calorimeter selection cuts. These cuts provide a rejection of about 1000 per jet and reduce the jet background to a sample of predominantly electromagnetic jets [2]. A further rejection of about three per jet is needed to bring this background down to the desired level. Since the events surviving the calorimeter selections consist mainly of isolated \(\pi^{0}\)'s, the only way to reject them is to distinguish single photon showers from showers produced by two nearby photons a few millimeters apart from each other. This requires a finely-segmented position-sensitive detector at the start of the shower.

### Detector models

This note describes the \(\gamma/\pi^{0}\) separation which can be achieved in the ATLAS detector with different layouts of the liquid argon (LAr) electromagnetic calorimeter and preshower device. Two models have been considered: a model with a separate preshower detector in front of the EM calorimeter, as proposed in the Letter of Intent [3], and a model in which the preshower is integrated in the first sampling of the calorimeter, which has been chosen as baseline option for the Technical Proposal ("TP model"). In the latter case, the first compartment of the EM calorimeter is segmented in strips a few mm wide and is preceded by a presampler device devoted to energy and angular measurements. The strips in the first sampling can be sensitive either to the \(\eta\) direction only (\(\eta\)-strips [4]), or to two views (\(UV\)-strips [5, 6]).

Both models, which are described in detail in [7], have have been studied and compared in the optimization of the EM calorimeter. In particular the \(\gamma/\pi^{0}\) separation capability of the two options was one of the main performance issues considered before choosing the baseline layout.

The results presented below concern only the barrel part of the calorimeter coverage (\(|\eta|<\)1.4) and were obtained with a GEANT simulation of the ATLAS detector, which included the detailed geometry of the accordion calorimeter. The performance in the end-cap region, where an integrated preshower has been chosen as in the barrel, will be presented in a forthcoming note.

### Photon conversions and role of the inner detector

Test beam results [8], as well as previous simulation studies of both the separate and the integrated preshower geometry [9, 10], have shown that the calorimeter-preshower system can provide the required rejection of three against \(\pi^{0}\)'s with high efficiency on single photons (90%). These results, however, were obtained only for photons which did not convert in the inner detector.

More recently, the problem of photon conversions in the material of the inner detector (Fig. 2) has been studied in detail and has been recognized as crucial for \(\gamma/\pi^{0}\) separation [11]. The \(e^{+}e^{-}\) pairs from photon conversions open up in the transverse plane owing to the 2 T magnetic field, and therefore tend to produce a two-shower pattern in the preshower even in the case of single photons. This pattern can thus fake a \(\pi^{0}\rightarrow\gamma\gamma\) decay.

The resulting effect on the \(\gamma/\pi^{0}\) identification depends on the preshower geometry. The integrated preshower with \(\eta\)-strips is not segmented in \(\phi\), therefore is only marginally affected by photon conversions. In the separate preshower model, where there are two fine-granularity views (\(\eta\) and \(\phi\)), the rejection provided by the \(\phi\)-coordinate is essentially lost in the case of conversions. The integrated preshower with \(UV\) strips allows for a larger \(\pi^{0}\) rejection than the \(\eta\)-strip geometry in the case of non-converted photons because it measures both views. In the case of converted photons, however, the two-shower patterns described above will affect both views (see Fig. 3), and this will significantly degrade the \(\gamma/\pi^{0}\) separation power.

In the case of converted photons, however, the inner detector can provide useful information. The total momentum of the \(e^{+}\) and \(e^{-}\) tracks can be measured and compared to the shower energy reconstructed in the calorimeter. Whereas in the case of single photons both measurements are expected to agree within the reconstruction accuracies (which depend strongly on the radius of conversion), in the case of \(\pi^{0}\rightarrow\gamma\gamma\) decays the measured calorimeter energy is expected to exceed the total momentum measured in the tracker.

For this reason the \(\gamma/\pi^{0}\) identification can only be thoroughly studied with full simulation and reconstruction in the inner detector and preshower. At this early stage of the software development, and with rapidly evolving detector models, this was not possible for all the analyses presented here, in which case reasonable approximations were used.

All the simulations discussed in this note are based on a complete description of the photon interaction in the material of the inner detector and in the calorimeter-preshower system. Dedicated pattern recognition studies have shown that the efficiency for reconstructing conversion pairs in the inner detector is high, as illustrated in the next table which shows, for \(\gamma\)'s and \(\pi^{0}\)'s of \(E_{T}\)=50 GeV at \(\eta\)= 0.3, the probabilities to reconstruct a given number of charged tracks in the inner detector for a conversion radius smaller than 90 cm (the inner detector active volume extends up to a radius of about 105 cm).

About half of the events with only one reconstructed track result from a conversion in the external layers of the inner detector (conversion radius larger than80 cm). The larger fraction (11%) of \(\pi^{0}\)'s with more than two reconstructed tracks is due to the non-negligible probability of converting both photons (8%).

Therefore in most of the analyses presented in this note, the charged track reconstruction in the inner detector was modelized as a momentum resolution function for early conversions (conversion radius smaller than 80 cm), and as the capability of simply detecting the presence of a conversion for conversion radii between 80 cm and 90 cm.

In addition, for one rapidity value (\(\eta\)=0.3) and for the separate preshower model only, the full reconstruction and combined analysis of the inner detector and calorimeter response was performed. The parameterized model was in reasonable agreement with these results.

## 2 \(\gamma/\pi^{0}\) separation with the separate preshower

This model is described in detail in Ref. [7]. Therefore only the main features will be recalled here.

The preshower detector consists of two LAr active layers interleaved with passive material. The latter is needed for good \(\gamma/\pi^{0}\) separation: the two photons from the \(\pi^{0}\) decay can be efficiently recognized from single photons only if both have converted and if their showers have developed sufficiently in the detector. The optimum amount of passive material results from a compromise between \(\pi^{0}\) rejection and energy resolution. The resolution of the EM calorimeter situated behind the preshower is in fact seriously spoiled when the upstream material exceeds about three radiation lengths. Simulations and test beam results [8] have shown that the best balance in performance is achieved with a total of 2 \(X_{0}\) (3 \(X_{0}\)) in front of the first (second) LAr layer. In the central part of the barrel (\(|\eta|<\)1.2) and in most of the end-cap coverage (\(|\eta|>\)1.8), the total material due to inner tracker, cryostat and coil is less than 2 \(X_{0}\), therefore some lead, tapered with rapidity, is added to reach the desired amount of converter. At the end of the barrel and at the beginning of the end-cap, the amount of material in front of the preshower detector is larger than 2 \(X_{0}\), therefore no extra lead is needed (see Fig. 4).

The first LAr layer of the preshower measures the \(\phi\)-coordinate and is equipped with strips of size \(\Delta\eta\times\Delta\phi\simeq 0.1\times 0.003\). The second layer measures the \(\eta\)-coordinate and has a granularity \(\Delta\eta\times\Delta\phi\simeq 0.003\times 0.1\).

The preshower is located in front of the EM calorimeter, inside the same cryostat. The radial distance in the shower direction between the cryostat warm wall and the first LAr layer of the preshower is about 25 cm at \(\eta\)=0 and about 50 cm at \(\eta\)=1.3.

### Analysis and results

The \(\gamma/\pi^{0}\) identification capability of the separate preshower in ATLAS was determined with single photons and \(\pi^{0}\)'s of \(E_{T}\)=50 GeV (typical transverse energy of photons from \(H\rightarrow\gamma\gamma\) decays) generated at two rapidity values: \(\eta\)= 0.3 and \(\eta\)=1.2. High statistics samples were produced (2300 \(\gamma\) and 2300 \(\pi^{0}\) events per rapidity point) in order to study in detail photon conversions in the inner detector.

Particles were generated with a vertex spread \(\sigma_{v}\)=5.6 cm over the full detector acceptance in \(\phi\) (2\(\pi\)) and over one calorimeter cell in \(\eta\) (\(\Delta\eta\)=0.025) centered on the nominal rapidity value. Electronic and pile-up noise was not included (see Section 2.1.2 for a further discussion of this point).

At \(\eta\)=0.3 the events were analyzed by using the calorimeter, preshower and inner detector information. At \(\eta\)=1.2 the material in the inner detector was precisely simulated, but the tracker information was not used in the analysis.

Events were classified according to whether a photon conversion occurred or not in the inner detector. At \(\eta\)=0.3 these conversions were detected using the tracker and the sample was further divided on the basis of the position of the conversion radius (\(R_{conv}\)). The resulting event fractions in the various classes are given in the table below.

\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|} \hline \(\eta\)= 0.3 \(p_{T}\)=50 GeV & \(\gamma\) & \(\pi^{0}\) \\ \hline Non converted or \(R_{conv}>\) 90 cm & 88\% & 77\% \\ \hline Converted: & & \\ \(R_{conv}<\) 50 cm & 5.9\% & 14\% \\ 50\(<\)\(R_{conv}<\) 80 cm & 4.4\% & 7.0\% \\ 80\(<\)\(R_{conv}<\) 90 cm & 1.4\% & 2.2\% \\ \hline \end{tabular}

It was found that, in the case of conversions with \(R_{conv}<\)90 cm, the pattern recognition of the inner detector always reconstructs at least one track (see Section 1). The fraction of \(\pi^{0}\)'s converting before 50 cm given in the table (14%) includes the contribution of Dalitz decays \(\pi^{0}\rightarrow\gamma e^{+}e^{-}\) (\(\sim\)1.2%).

At \(\eta\)=1.2, the presence of a conversion and the conversion radius were deduced from the particle bank (KINE). The resulting event fractions in the different classes are listed in the next table.

#### 2.1.1 Non-converted photons

In the case of photons not converting in the inner detector or converting with \(R_{conv}>\) 90 cm, i.e. close to the end of the active volume of the tracker, only the preshower and the calorimeter information can be used to recognize single \(\gamma\)'s from \(\pi^{0}\)'s.

The following variables were considered in the analysis:

* the energies in the two preshower layers. The probability that a conversion signal is seen in the two active layers of the preshower is larger for a \(\pi^{0}\) (two photons) than for a single photon. Figures 5a) and 5b) show that there is a non negligible fraction of single photons not converting in the passive material of the preshower. Therefore particles giving less than 1 mip (2 mips) in the most energetic strip of the first (second) layer were classified as photons. One mip corresponds to about 30 MeV in units of calibrated energy. At \(\eta\)=0.3 this selection allows to keep about 25% of the single photons at the price of calling photons about 7% of the \(\pi^{0}\)'s.
* the shower profile. As can be seen in Fig. 6, most of the energy of a single photon shower (\(\sim\)70%) is contained in two strips. Therefore the variable "profile" was defined, in each layer, as the ratio between the energy deposited in the most energetic pair of adjacent strips divided by the energy released in \(\pm\)8 strips (corresponding to two calorimeter cells) centered on the strip with the highest signal. Figs. 7a) and 7b) show that the distribution of this variable peaks at lower values for the broader two-shower patterns from \(\pi^{0}\) decays than for single photons.
* matching between the shower \(\phi\)-positions reconstructed in the calorimeter and in the preshower. This is useful to reject events in which only one of the two photons from the \(\pi^{0}\) decay converted in the preshower. In this case, in fact, the shower position in the preshower, which is that of the converted photon, will not in general match the shower barycentre reconstructed in the calorimeter, which is that of the \(\pi^{0}\). This method can only be used in the \(\phi\) direction, where the position of the interaction vertex is known with a precision of about 15 \(\mu\)m. The distribution of the difference between the \(\phi\)-positions measured in the calorimeter and in the preshower for \(\gamma\)'s and \(\pi^{0}\)'s is shown in Fig. 8 (top).
* isolation. The second most energetic shower 1 is also reconstructed in each layer. Figure 9 (top) shows, for \(\gamma\) and \(\pi^{0}\) events, the distribution of the energy of this second shower. To classify a particle as a single photon, this energy was typically required to be less than 10 mip.

The \(\pi^{0}\) rejection obtained with a suitable combination of cuts on these variables is three at \(\eta\)=0.3, and about 15% lower at the end of the barrel, as shown in Fig. 10. These values correspond to an efficiency of (90\(\pm\)0.4)% for single photons. The degradation observed at larger rapidity can be attributed to the fact that at \(\eta\)=1.2 the \(2\,X_{0}\) of passive material upstream of the first preshower layer come mainly from the cryostat and coil, and are therefore spread over a large distance (about 50 cm) in front of the preshower. Therefore early-starting showers appear broader in the preshower even in the case of single photons, at the expense of the efficiency of the identification cuts.

#### 2.1.2 Converted photons

As mentioned in Section 1, a preshower device sensitive to the \(\phi\) view is penalized by the presence of upstream material inside a solenoidal magnetic field, because the \(e^{+}e^{-}\) pairs from photon conversions open up in \(\phi\) and can therefore give rise to two clusters in the preshower even in the case of single photons. The resulting effect can be observed in Figs. 7 to 9, in which the distributions of the shape variables described in Section 2.1.1 for non-converted photons are compared to the distributions of the same variables for events with one or more converted \(\gamma\)'s. It can be seen that the \(\phi\)-view is essentially useless in the case of conversions. Variables based on the \(\eta\) coordinate, which is not sensitive to the magnetic field, can still be used, but with looser cuts than in the case of non-converted photons (again due to the broadening of early showers).

Therefore, if one uses only the calorimeter and preshower information, i.e. the variables described in Section 2.1.1 and the same cuts for converted and non-converted \(\gamma\)'s, the \(\pi^{0}\) rejection over the total event sample (all photons) would be deteriorated, with respect to the case of non-converted photons only, as shown in Fig. 10.

However, the inner detector can help the calorimeter and the preshower in the presence of converted photons. The detection of the conversion represents already a useful information. In this case, in fact, the preshower and calorimeter selections can be tuned separately for the subsamples of the non-converted and converted photons, and also different variables can be used for the two classes. Figure 9 shows, for instance, that a cut on the second most energetic cluster in the preshower is not helpful for the class of converted \(\gamma\)'s, because in this case two showers are usually reconstructed also in the case of single photons. On the other hand, the distribution of the third most energetic shower (Fig. 11) indicates some differences in the topology of \(\gamma\) and \(\pi^{0}\) events.

Figure 5 (bottom) also shows that, in the case of conversions, the minimum signal detected in the preshower layers tends to be higher for \(\gamma\)'s than for \(\pi^{0}\)'s, because the energy of the \(e^{+}e^{-}\) pairs produced by single photons is on average larger than

in the case of photons from \(\pi^{0}\) decays. The class of non-converted photons shows an opposite behaviour (Fig. 5 top).

Therefore, knowing that a conversion occurred allows to improve the \(\pi^{0}\) rejection for all photons even using only the calorimeter and preshower information. This is shown in the table below (values are given for 90% photon efficiency).

\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|} \hline  & \(\pi^{0}\) rejection \(\eta\)=0.3 & \(\pi^{0}\) rejection \(\eta\)=1.2 \\ \hline Conversion not detected & 2.20\(\pm\) 0.15 & 1.97\(\pm\) 0.15 \\ Conversion detected & 2.70\(\pm\) 0.15 & 2.20\(\pm\) 0.15 \\ Full tracker information & 3.05\(\pm\) 0.15 & \(-\) \\ \hline \end{tabular}

The last line of the table, as well as Fig. 10, indicate that a larger rejection can be obtained by exploiting the complete information of the inner detector, that is by using the reconstructed tracks of the \(e^{+}e^{-}\) pairs produced in the conversions. Both the pattern recognition of the inner detector and the analysis described here are not yet fully optimized. Therefore the results presented in this note have to be considered as preliminary. Furthermore a combined study of the tracker, preshower and calorimeter performance for \(\gamma/\pi^{0}\) separation using a full simulation was only done at \(\eta\)=0.3.

The most powerful combined variable is the ratio between the total \(p_{T}\) of the two tracks reconstructed in the inner detector and the transverse energy of the shower measured in the calorimeter. This ratio should be in general close to unity for single photons, and distributed between 0 and 1 for \(\pi^{0}\)'s. Examples are given in Fig. 12. One can observe the degradation of the tracker momentum resolution as \(R_{conv}\) increases (the momentum measurement in the inner detector being more accurate for longer tracks, i.e. for small values of \(R_{conv}\)), as well as the tails from electron bremsstrahlung in the material at larger radii than \(R_{conv}\). Therefore for \(R_{conv}<\) 50 cm a \(p_{T}/E_{T}\) cut alone was used. For 50 cm \(<\)\(R_{conv}<\) 80 cm this cut was combined with selections on the shower shape in the preshower. Finally for 80 \(<\)\(R_{conv}<\) 90 cm the conversion was detected in the inner detector, but the track segment was too short to be precisely measured. Therefore only the preshower and calorimeter information were used in this case, however with variables and cuts tuned in different ways for the subsamples of converted and non-converted photons, as explained above.

The \(\pi^{0}\) rejection achieved in this way is shown in the next table as a function of the conversion radius. Values are given for 90% photon efficiency.

In conclusion, the \(\pi^{0}\) rejection provided by the standalone preshower-calorimeter system for 90% photon efficiency is about three (Section 1). Inside the ATLAS environment, i.e. in the presence of the detector material and therefore of photon conversions, this rejection is reduced to two, but can be restored to the factor three obtained for unconverted photons with the help of the tracker. The results presented here did not include yet any constraint on the \(e^{+}e^{-}\) pair to be compatible with a photon conversion. More study is needed in order to evaluate whether the tracker performance can be improved further.

As already mentioned at the beginning, the electronic and pile-up noises were not included in these simulations. Both noises are expected to contribute about 0.2 mip/strip (r.m.s.) at the LHC design luminosity of 10\({}^{34}\) cm\({}^{-2}\) s\({}^{-1}\)[9, 10]. The effect on the \(\gamma/\pi^{0}\) identification in the calorimeter and separate preshower had been estimated previously [9]. It was found that the \(\pi^{0}\) rejection decreases by about 10%, for a fixed 90% photon efficiency, with respect to the case with no noise. The influence of the expected pile-up of minimum bias events at the full LHC luminosity on the pattern recognition in the inner detector, and therefore on the performance for converted photons, has still to be evaluated in the full simulation framework, but it is expected to be small [12].

## 3 \(\gamma/\pi^{0}\) separation with the TP model

In this model, the \(\gamma/\pi^{0}\) separation capability is provided by the highly segmented first sampling of the EM calorimeter. Two different ways of drawing strips on the readout kapton electrodes have been considered [7], leading to two different geometries.

In the first solution (\(\eta\)-strips), strips projective in \(\eta\) and of size \(\Delta\eta=\)0.025/8 are etched on each kapton board. Sixteen boards are then grouped together in \(\phi\) in the same readout channel, leading to a readout granularity of \(\Delta\eta\times\Delta\phi\simeq 0.003\times 0.1\).

The second possibility (_UV_-strips [6]) consists in drawing strips at a constant \(U=\eta-\phi\) on the odd kaptons, and at a constant \(V=\eta+\phi\) on the even kaptons. The size of these strips along the \(z\) axis is \(\Delta\eta=0.025/4\). Eight consecutive \(U\) (or \(V\)) kaptons are grouped together in \(\phi\) in the same readout channel. This leads to a granularity of \(\Delta U(\Delta V)\times\Delta\phi\simeq 0.006\times 0.1\), and to the same total number of channels in the first sampling of the barrel calorimeter as for the \(\eta\)-strip solution (\(\sim\)57000).

### Description of the analysis

The \(\gamma/\pi^{0}\) separation using the integrated preshower with \(\eta\)-strips or \(UV\)-strips was studied with photons and neutral pions of \(E_{T}\)=50 GeV generated at four rapidity values in the barrel EM calorimeter (\(\eta\)=0.3,0.8,1.0,1.2).

Both geometries (\(\eta\), \(UV\)) can be obtained in a single event generation by grouping elementary hits in the two appropriate ways. The charge induced by each hit on the neighbouring strips was computed by taking into account the distance of the hit from the strip and its position in the gap.

The particle production vertex was spread along the \(z\)-axis according to the expected vertex smearing at the LHC (\(\sigma_{z}\)=5.6 cm). About 500 photons and 700 \(\pi^{0}\)'s were generated at each rapidity point. They were distributed over the full \(\phi\) angle and over a region of size \(\Delta\eta=\pm 0.05\) around the nominal rapidity value. The typical 90% photon efficiency for which the cuts were set was known with an uncertainty of about 1.5%.

Examples of shower profiles reconstructed in the first sampling of the calorimeter are shown in Fig. 3 for \(\gamma\) and \(\pi^{0}\) events in the \(UV\) strips.

Photons and \(\pi^{0}\) were identified on the basis of the shower shape in the strip compartment. The following variables were used in the analysis (see Fig. 13):

* \(F_{1}\) is the energy of the shower in the first sampling of the calorimeter divided by the energy in the three samplings. This fraction is generally small for photons interacting late in the first sampling, and larger for \(\pi^{0}\)'s which start earlier. Events with \(F_{1}<0.02\) were therefore classified as photons.
* the two adjacent strips with the highest signals are located. \(F_{2}\) is the sum of their energies divided by the energy contained in 31 strips centered on the most energetic one ("profile").
* the width (\(\sigma\)) of the shower is the second order moment of the energy distribution computed on \(\pm 2\) strips around the most energetic one.
* the second local maximum in the strip section was found. \(E_{2}^{T}\) is the transverse energy of this maximum plus \(\pm 1\) strip around it.

In the case of \(UV\)-strips, cuts are applied on \(E_{2U}^{T}+E_{2V}^{T}\), on \(\sigma=\left(\sigma_{U}^{2}+\sigma_{V}^{2}\right)^{1/2}\) and in the \(\left(\sigma_{U},\sigma_{V}\right)\) and \(\left(F_{2U},F_{2V}\right)\) planes.

The width of the shower, as measured in the first sampling of the calorimeter, depends on the conversion point of the photon: photons interacting late deposit a smaller fraction of their energy in the first compartment and are narrower, as shown in Fig. 14. The use of a 2-dimensional cut in the \(\left(\sigma,F_{1}\right)\) plane is one of the improvements of the analysis since the Technical Proposal.

In the case of converted photons, the tracker information was taken into account in a simplified way, as mentioned in Section 1:* conversions occurring at a given radius \(R_{conv}\) were supposed to be detected in the inner tracker if \(R_{conv}<93\) cm.
* \(R_{conv}\) is the length of the track (105 cm is the end of the active tracker).

Four classes of events can therefore be defined:

* events with two conversions seen in the tracker: they are rejected as \(\pi^{0}\)'s.
* events with one conversion below 80 cm: a cut on the ratio between the transverse momenta of the \(e^{+}e^{-}\) pair measured in the tracker and the transverse energy of the shower reconstructed in the calorimeter is used (see Fig. 15). This is combined with a cut on the shower width in the strips. For these events the \(\pi^{0}\) rejection for 90% photon efficiency is typically 3.5 to 4, depending on the conversion radius.
* events with one conversion between 80 and 93 cm: in the case of \(\eta\)-strips these events have been treated as the class of the non converted (see below); in the case of \(UV\)-strips, two clusters are seen in general in the strips, but the relation \(\sigma_{u}\simeq\sigma_{v}\) remains true for two photons separated only in \(\phi\), as can be seen in Fig. 3.
* events with no conversion seen in the tracker: only the shape variables described before have been used.

In the analysis presented in the Technical Proposal, no distinction was made between the last two classes.

### Results

Figure 16 shows the \(\pi^{0}\) rejection obtained with \(\eta\)-strips with the analysis described above. The error bars include only the statistical error on the rejection and not the uncertainty on the photon efficiency. For 90% photon efficiency the rejection is about 2.8 at \(\eta=0.3\) and decreases slowly towards the end of the barrel. This behaviour will be explained in Section 3.2.1. Since the \(e^{+}e^{-}\) pairs from photon conversions in the tracker are opened in \(\phi\), the performance of the \(\eta\)-strip geometry is affected only because the electrons from the conversions start to shower early in the cryostat or in the coil and therefore give rise to a broader shower in the calorimeter. Hence the presence of the inner detector does not significantly affect the rejection, but using

the information of the tracker helps to improve the performance, especially at large rapidity.

Figure 17 shows the \(\pi^{0}\) rejection obtained with \(UV\)-strips. The rejection for particles non converted before the cryostat decreases from 4.4 to 2.2 over the barrel length. When all photons are considered, and if the tracker is not used, the rejection, which is significantly affected by the converted photons faking two distinct showers in the strips, decreases from 2.9 at \(\eta=0.3\) to 1.6 at \(\eta=1.2\) for 90% photon efficiency. If the tracker information is considered, the result improves to 3.4 at \(\eta\)=0.3 and to 2.3 at \(\eta\)=1.2.

The \(\pi^{0}\) rejection obtained with different levels of tracker information is shown in the table below. Results are given for \(UV\) strips and for 90% photon efficiency.

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|} \hline Rapidity & tracker not & conversions & momentum \\  & used & seen & measured \\ \hline
0.3 & 2.92 \(\pm\) 0.14 & 3.04 \(\pm\) 0.15 & 3.42 \(\pm\) 0.18 \\
1.2 & 1.56 \(\pm\) 0.05 & 1.97 \(\pm\) 0.08 & 2.29 \(\pm\) 0.10 \\ \hline \end{tabular}

In particular the performance is improved even if the tracker is only used to decide whether a conversion occured or not, without providing any momentum measurement.

The \(\pi^{0}\) rejections for 90% and 85% photon efficiencies obtained using the calorimeter and tracker information are shown in the table below.

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|} \hline \(\eta\) & \multicolumn{2}{c|}{\(\eta\) strips} & \multicolumn{2}{c|}{\(UV\) strips} \\  & \(\epsilon_{\gamma}=90\%\) & \(\epsilon_{\gamma}=85\%\) & \(\epsilon_{\gamma}=90\%\) & \(\epsilon_{\gamma}=85\%\) \\ \hline
0.3 & 2.95 \(\pm\) 0.14 & 3.53 \(\pm\) 0.19 & 3.42 \(\pm\) 0.18 & 4.00 \(\pm\) 0.24 \\
0.8 & 2.79 \(\pm\) 0.15 & 3.24 \(\pm\) 0.20 & 2.68 \(\pm\) 0.14 & 3.70 \(\pm\) 0.25 \\
1.0 & 2.64 \(\pm\) 0.15 & 3.20 \(\pm\) 0.19 & 2.27 \(\pm\) 0.11 & 2.80 \(\pm\) 0.16 \\
1.2 & 2.81 \(\pm\) 0.14 & 3.44 \(\pm\) 0.20 & 2.29 \(\pm\) 0.10 & 2.95 \(\pm\) 0.16 \\ \hline \end{tabular}

The analysis presented here does not include the pile-up nor the electronic noise contribution. The latter is discussed in Section 3.2.2.

#### 3.2.1 Shower width

Figure 18 shows the average width of photon showers of \(E_{T}\)=50 GeV as a function of rapidity. In order to have cleaner samples, only photons with no energy (less than 20 MeV) in the presampler were considered. The width (in strip units) measured with \(UV\)-strips is smaller than with \(\eta\)-strips because the strips are \(\sqrt{2}\) times larger.

Since the strip width measured along the \(z\)-axis is constant in \(\eta\), the width seen by a photon coming from the interaction centre is also constant in the direction transverse to the shower. Therefore for a given lead thickness and for a constant thickness of the first sampling, the shower width measured in the strips should be constant. Figure 18 shows that the width actually increases by about 10% when going from \(\eta=0.3\) to \(\eta=1.2\).

This may be explained by two effects:

* The dead material between the presampler and the calorimeter increases from 0.7 \(X_{0}\) at \(\eta=0.3\) to 1.2 \(X_{0}\) at \(\eta=1.2\), leading to a deeper part of the shower being seen, on average, in the first sampling.
* The electric field in the argon gaps is perpendicular to the electrode or absorber planes, and not projective towards the interaction point. Thus the physical strips overlap in space, and the overlap increases with \(\eta\).

The small loss in rejection in the case of \(\eta\)-strips can be associated to this increase in the shower width with rapidity, but the larger loss observed with _UV_-strips needs further investigation.

#### 3.2.2 Electronic noise

The effect of the electronic noise on the \(\pi^{0}\) rejection was evaluated by adding a smearing of 20 MeV / sin \(\theta\) to the energy seen in each strip (\(\theta\) is the strip polar angle with respect to the beam axis). Results are given in the table below for a fixed 90% photon efficiency. The tracker information is not used in this case.

\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|c|} \hline \(\eta\) & strips & without noise & with noise \\ \hline
0.3 & \(\eta\) & 2.78 \(\pm\) 0.12 & 2.72 \(\pm\) 0.12 \\  & _UV_ & 2.92 \(\pm\) 0.14 & 2.50 \(\pm\) 0.10 \\ \hline
1.2 & \(\eta\) & 2.36 \(\pm\) 0.09 & 2.19 \(\pm\) 0.09 \\  & _UV_ & 1.56 \(\pm\) 0.05 & 1.56 \(\pm\) 0.05 \\ \hline \end{tabular}

#### 3.2.3 Thickness of the strip section

The \(\pi^{0}\) rejection obtained with a deeper first sampling (\(5.5\,X_{0}\) tapered with rapidity) is compared, in the next table, to the results achieved with the design depth of 4.5 \(X_{0}\). Values are given for 90% photon efficiency and include the use of the tracker information.

With a thicker first sampling the rejection is slightly improved, especially in the case of _UV_-strips. In the case of \(\eta\)-strips, where the \(\phi\) position of the showers is measured in the second sampling of the calorimeter [13], the first sampling must be kept as thin as possible. In the _UV_-strip geometry, on the other hand, where \(\phi\) can be measured also in the strip section, the thickness of the first sampling could be increased to about 5.5 \(X_{0}\). Therefore the optimum depth depends on the strip geometry, and in case of \(\eta\)-strips is a compromise between \(\pi^{0}\) rejection and position resolution in \(\phi\). This aspect is still under study.

## 4 Conclusions

The \(\gamma/\pi^{0}\) separation capability of devices with two views, as the separate preshower or the integrated preshower with \(UV\) strips, is affected by photon conversions in the material of the inner detector. All geometries benefit, however, from the use of the tracker information, which, in combination with the EM calorimeter and preshower, provides \(\pi^{0}\) rejections between 2.5 and 3.5 (depending on the model and on the rapidity) for 90% photon efficiency. This is adequate to achieve the required jet background rejection for the observation of a possible \(H\rightarrow\gamma\gamma\) signal at the LHC.

The complete combined analysis of the inner detector and calorimeter information has now to be performed with the baseline model at all rapidities.

Finally the results presented in this note indicate that the \(\gamma/\pi^{0}\) separation capabilities of the baseline TP layout (integrated preshower) and of the separate preshower model are similar.
