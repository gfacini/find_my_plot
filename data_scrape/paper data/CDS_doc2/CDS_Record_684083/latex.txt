Introduction

The first batch of WLS fibres (25000 fibres from 11 different preforms) was received in Pisa and submitted to the Quality Control procedure (Q.C.) in July 1999.

The measurements of attenuation length and light yield performed on 18 fibre samples per preform [2] showed a poor quality of fibres from preform AP008. A total of five sets of 18 fibres from preform AP008 have been measured. Three of these sets show smaller mean values and longer spread of the optical parameters, (attenuation length \(\lambda\) and light yield \(n\)) than the other preforms in the batch. In Fig. 1 the results of preform AP008 (hatched histogram) are plotted overlayed with the rest of batch 1. In this plot it is clear the poor quality of that preform. According with these results the preform AP008 was rejected.

These results for preform AP008 were in contrast with Kuraray Q.C. results. For this reason a new sample of 40 fibres was selected at CERN and sent back to the firm for new investigation.

The fibre lengths of this new sample are listed in the table below:

Accordingly with the protocol for Q.C. procedure only fibres of at least 200 \(cm\) long should be used for Q.C. scope.

This new sample of fibres was measured by Kuraray and sent to Pisa to allow a cross check and an intercalibration of the two measurement techniques. In order to compare the measurements done by Kuraray and by us in Pisa, we have to keep track of the differences in the two setups. Infact, as we have shown in [1], the measurements of the attenuation length and of the light yield depend also on how the coupling of fibre to photomultiplier is realized. The coupling selects a particular mode of propagation of light into the fibre and therefore, affects both the attenuation length and the light yield.

In Kuraray scheme the fibre is directly coupled to PMT [3], while we collect the light from WLS fibres to the PMT through a clear fibre [2]. Differences between results from the two measurement techniques are expected.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|c||c|c|} \hline N. fibres & Length (cm) & Label \\ \hline
10 & 207 & AP008-207 \\
10 & 193 & AP008-193-2 \\
10 & 193 & AP008-193-5 \\
10 & 182 & AP008-182 \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 1: Composition of the fibre sample.

The measurements of the same fibres by Pis a and Kuraray, provide a quantitative estimate of these differences.

## 2 The Kuraray Measurements

In this section we summarise the measurements performed by Kuraray on the last four samples from preform AP008.

Each individual fibre was labelled by Kuraray to allow comparison of results for the same fibre. Each fibre is prepared in the following way: each end of the WLS fibre is cut and polished using sand paper (satinated way),

Figure 1: _Distribution of attenuation length (upper plot) an d light yield (lower plot) for first batch. In hatched are the data of preform AP008._

one end of the fibre is coupled to PMT (HAMAMATZU R647), and the other end blackened.

The measurement is performed by moving a blue LED along the fibre from 70 cm up to 200 cm in 5 cm steps. The attenuation length and light output at 140 cm is obtained by fitting the attenuation curve by a single exponential.

The results, as obtained by Kuraray are summarised in Tab. 2.

The mean value, RMS and relative spread (\(RMS/mean\)) for each set of data are shown in the last three rows of table 2. The distribution of these data are plotted in figure 2.

We have to stress that for three samples the relative spread of light yield \(n_{k}^{sw}\) is greater than 7% which is the threshold for the Q.C. acceptance. Because of these results this preform has to be rejected.

In this respect also the Kuraray measurements confirm the results of our QC. However, according to Kuraray, Preform AP008 fails because of the spread in light yield, while our results had pointed to a poor attenuation length quality.

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:6]

We can notice that samples AP008-193-5 and AP008-182 shows a relative spread of _L.Y._ much larger than the Q.C. acceptance threshold. This result agrees with the Kuraray one, (Table 2). More significant is the difference between the measurements of the attenuation length and light output as we discuss below.

Figure 3 show the distributions of attenuation length and light yield for the four measured samples.

Figure 3: _Attenuation Length and light yield at 14 0 cm distribution for the four samples as measured with multifibre setup, the fibre ends preparation is made by Kuraray._

Figure 4 show a comparison of the Pisa results versus Kuraray ones. We have assumed that errors in the Kuraray measurements are similar to those in our measurements (\(\sim 3\%\) for attenuation length, \(\sim 2\%\) for light yield).

The scatter plot of the attenuation length measured in the two ways shows a good correlation ( 70% - coefficient of linear regression) between the two measurements and an average deviation \(\mid\lambda_{m}^{sw}-\lambda_{k}^{sw}\mid=37\pm 2\ cm\), smaller than what we would expect because of the different optical light collection 2. In the scatter plot of light yield the correlation is much poorer.

Footnote 2: As we have explained in [1] using a simulation MC, there is a difference of \(\sim 55\ cm\) between the attenuation length obtained in the two different modes of light transmission, and this difference is confirmed from experimental result.

Figure 5 shows the correlation between light yield and attenuation length respectively, in the measurements performed in Pisa (middle plot) and the Kuraray ones (upper plot).

A positive correlation is present in the Pisa measurements, as expected by any light propagation model, while the Kuraray measurements show a

Figure 4: _Comparison between Kuraray measurements and multifibre measurements._

negative or no correlation. The absence of correlation in the Kuraray measurements suggests that those measurements are affected by large uncertainties.

Figure 5: _Comparison between attenuation length and light yield at \(140\ cm\) correlation. The lower plot shows the correlation when the fibres are prepared in our Q.C. procedures._

Pisa Measurements with fibre Q.C. preparation

Each fibre was cut at one end by a diamond cutting machine and blackened at the other end as in the usual Pisa Q.C. procedure and the optical properties of fibres were measured using the Multifibre setup. Table 4 reports the results.

Figure 6 shows the distributions of the new measurements of attenuation length and light yield.

The dispersion of light yield now is smaller than in the previous results, and within the Q.C. requirements. For instance we can notice that the relative spread of light output of the sample AP008-193-5, is 11.5% in Kuraray measurements (_sw_) and 12% in multifibre measurements (_sw_) decreasing to 4.4% in new measurements (_mw_) when we did a standard Pisa Q.C. fibre ends preparation.

This effect is to be attributed to inhomogeneities in Kuraray fibre end preparation.

Figure 7 show a comparison of these measurements (_mw_) with the previous ones (_sw_). The preparation is the only difference between these and the previous measurements. A good correlation can be appreciated in attenuation length scatter plot, whereas in the light yield one the correlation is even poorer than that in Figure 4.

We conclude that the effect due to the polishing techniques is predominant

Figure 6: _Attenuation Length and Light Yield distributions for the four samples, as measured using multifibre apparatus and standards Pisa Q.C. preparation of fibre ends._

and especially for the _sw_ preparation is difficult to keep under control the optical quality of the fibre end.

Also the difference in average attenuation length (about 10 cm.) is likely to be due to the different preparations of the end of the fibres. Infact the Kuraray polishing procedure creates a diffusive surface at the fibre edge and all the emerging light rays (also the more attenuated) have some chance of being collected by the clear fibre to the PMT, whereas with the diamond cutting only rays below the total reflection angle can be transmitted to the clear fibres, and those rays are more straight and less attenuated.

Figure 7: _Comparison between measurements performed with multifibre apparatus and the two different fibre ends preparations._

We expected that the attenuation length or the light yield measured with an experimental technique is a linear function of the same quantity measured with an other experimental technique, i.e. specified by a slope and an offset.

This is confirmed in figure 8 showing for the attenuation length the correlation between results obtained in different experimental conditions. Unfortunately the range of variation of fibre attenuation length and light yield in the measured sample, is not large enough to permit a good estimation of both parameters.

For example by looking at the figure 8(middle) which shows the comparison between two Pisa measurements of attenuation length (_sw_ and _mw_) we

Figure 8: _Comparison between all the measurements of attenuation length. Measurement performed by Kuraray with their (sw) fibre preparation is indicated with \(\lambda_{k}^{sw}\), and those performed in Pisa with \(\lambda_{m}^{sw}\) and \(\lambda_{m}^{mw}\) (satined,mirrored)._

see that the small offset of the fitted straight line is a consequence of the different fibre preparations.

The correlation between light yield (fig. 9) is less clear, and as already said, this is a consequence on inhomogeneities in _sw_ preparation of the fibre.

We consider that the main difference between Kuraray and our measurements of attenuation length is well described by an offset due to the different light collection geometry, whereas for the light yield measurements the effect should be described by a scale factor (this take into account also the different measure unity). With the aim to disentangle the differences between Pis a and Kuraray measurements in terms of effects due separately to fibre end preparation and light collection we consider the following quantities (average

Figure 9: _Comparison between all the different measurements of fibre light yield_.

is made on all measurements):

\[\langle\lambda_{m}^{mw}-\lambda_{m}^{sw}\rangle = 7cm\pm 2cm \tag{1}\] \[\langle\frac{n_{m}^{mw}}{n_{m}^{sw}}\rangle = 0.85\pm 0.01.\]

The quantity above are sensitive to fibre end preparation, while:

\[\langle\lambda_{m}^{sw}-\lambda_{k}^{sw}\rangle = 37\pm 2cm \tag{2}\] \[\langle\frac{n_{m}^{sw}}{n_{k}^{sw}}\rangle = 3.40\pm 0.05\]

are sensitive to the light collection geometry.

The quantities that contain both contributions (geometrical effects and fibre preparation) are of course:

\[\langle\lambda_{m}^{mw}-\lambda_{k}^{sw}\rangle = 45\pm 2 \tag{3}\] \[\langle\frac{n_{m}^{mw}}{n_{k}^{sw}}\rangle = 2.89\pm 0.04\]

As expected the effect in 3 is due to the sum of that in 1 and that in 2, proving that at least for averaged quantities, the whole picture is consistent.

We must notice that the differences between Kuraray and our measurements of attenuation length is smaller that we would expect from our model of light attenuation in the fibre [1].

## 5 Pisa measurement with Kuraray method

We have measured the attenuation length of the AP-008-207 fibres also using our previous method (ref.[4]) for fibres characterisation which is similar to the Kuraray experimental setup. We have performed the measurements using fibres as prepared by Kuraray. In this experimental conditions no significant difference is expected between our measurements and the Kuraray ones.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c c c c c c c c c c|} \hline Fibres N.O. & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 & 7 & 8 & 9 & 10 \\ \hline \(\lambda_{k}^{sw}\) & 263 & 261 & 263 & 257 & 282 & 255 & 264 & 257 & 257 & 254 \\ \hline \(\lambda\) & 239 & 238 & 243 & 237 & 245 & 234 & 234 & 225 & 224 & 244 \\ \hline \(\lambda_{k}^{sw}-\lambda\) & 15 & 16 & 11 & 17 & 9 & 20 & 20 & 29 & 30 & 10 \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 5: Attenuation length (\(\lambda\)) measured using a Kuraray like apparatus and differences with Kuraray measurements.

Table 5 and Fig. 10 show a comparison between the results. As we can see still exists a significant difference between the measurements. Using the result of the MonteCarlo [1], we see that an air gap of 3-4 _mm_ between fibre and PMT would explain the difference. We also remark that if we add the average difference of the attenuation length (\(\Delta\lambda=18\)_cm_) to the average result (Eq. 2), we get \(\Delta\lambda=55\)_cm_ in good agreement with Montecarlo predictions.

Another possible explanation of the larger attenuation length in Kuraray measurement could be an appreciable dark current level.

In Figure 11 is shown the result of a simple analysis: If we sum a constant level on an exponential distribution (attenuation curve of a fibre), and then fit it with a exponential function in the region of \(x\) larger that 70_cm_, is easy to show that the fitted attenuation length increases.

## 6 Conclusions

We have investigated the systematic differences in fibre characterisation between Kuraray measurement procedures and ours both in terms of experimental methods and possible experimental biases.

The comparison of all the measurements described in this report shows that:

* On the attenuation length there is a good correlation among in two measurements. the two measurements cannot be directly compared because of differences in the experimental setup. Once kept into account the differences the results are in good agreement. However there is a significant difference between the two measurements (about \(15\;cm\)) that cannot be attributed to the different setup (This is confirmed by the measurement of fibres with Kuraray-like setup). We attempt two hypothesis: an air gap of \(4\;mm\) between fibre and PMT or a level of dark current of \(\frac{I_{dark}}{I(0)}\sim 3\%\). We lack more information on Kuraray setup to proceed a further analysis;
* The light yield measurements shows little or any correlation between

Figure 11: _Behaviour of the fitted attenuation length with the fraction of dark current._the two measurements, moreover a detailed analysis of internal consistency of Kuraray results seems to shed doubts on the correctness of Kuraray results. We suggest that the poor quality of fibre end polishing could be responsible of the poor reproducibility of Kuraray results.

Coming now to the acceptance of preform AP008 we remark the following points:

* Accordingly to Kuraray results on the 40 fibres remeasured after the rejection of the preform, the preform would be rejected. However we do not quite agree with the conclusion from this analysis;
* The measurements of these 40 fibres done by us, with our own Q.C. procedure shows that preform AP008 would have been accepted, on the basis of these measurements alone;
* These results are not in contradiction with our previous statements than, in average, preform AP008 is of poor quality. Infact the Q.C. is based on a sampling test, not all the fibre can be tested. As can be seen in Figure 1 only 10% of fibre fails the test in our original Quality Control. The number of fibres that we test in each preform is defined by a compromise between the effectiveness of the test and a reasonable time to be dedicated to the Quality Control;
* The kinds of tests on the fibres done by Kuraray is of poorer quality with respect to our. This is particularly true for the light yield measurement. There is enough evidence that also the attenuation length measurement is affected by systematic uncertainties. We do not have enough elements to understand the origin of these problems.
* All this lengthy analysis has confirmed to us that our experimental procedures are solid and well understood. We have to confirm our previous statement that PA 008 is a poor preform and has to be rejected. Given the type of tests that we are doing, it can happens that a set of fibres are, by a random chance, homogeneous and acceptable and this is a kind of failure that we have to accept. However when it happens that a set of fibres are of poor quality, we have proved that we are able to spot it and tag the preform as defective.
