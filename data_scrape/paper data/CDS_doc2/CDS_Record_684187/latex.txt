###### Abstract

Lorentz angle in silicon detectors is computed from drift properties of charge carriers. It is found to be a strongly varying function of electric field. From this model, the Lorentz angle for ATLAS silicon detectors (SCT and Pixel) is computed. It results to be a function of applied bias and sensor thickness. Some considerations are made about the effect of Lorentz angle variation on spatial resolution and alignment.

## 1 Introduction

The presence of a magnetic field influence electrons and holes drift in silicon, making them move at an angle with electric field direction. This angle \(\Theta_{L}\) is called Lorentz angle and influences properties of the detectors such as strip or pixel cluster size and spatial resolution as a function of incident particle angle. It also shifts the cluster coordinate in the direction perpendicular to electric and magnetic field (\(R\phi\) in ATLAS reference frame). The knowledge of this angle is thus needed for a correct simulation of the detector response and for an understanding of alignment systematics at the level of 1 \(\mu\)m, required for a precision measurement of W mass [1].

The operating conditions of the detector will change with time, as a consequence of irradiation. Non-uniformity of wafer-to-wafer sensor properties (such as depletion and breakdown voltages) may make necessary to operate different modules at different operating voltages. As it is shown in this note, these effects make the Lorentz angle to be a function of space and time, and not a constant parameter.

In this note a model of charge drift in silicon, developed to compute the expected Lorentz angle, is presented. The dependence of the mobility of charge carriers on the electric field makes the Lorentz angle to be a function of appliedbias and depletion thickness. The predictions of the model are in agreement with the Lorentz angle measurements done in Pixel and SCT test beams [2], [3].

The model is used to evaluate the Lorentz angle in ATLAS operating conditions. The predicted Lorentz angle as a function of applied bias and silicon layer thickness is given for the Pixel and the SCT detectors. However, as SCT microstrips collect holes while the pixels collect electrons, the Lorentz angle results much greater and more bias-dependent for pixel detectors. Some considerations are made about the effects on alignment, spatial resolution and cluster multiplicity.

## 2 The model

The Lorentz angle \(\Theta_{L}\) is given by [4]

\[\tan\Theta_{L}=\mu_{H}B=r\mu_{d}B \tag{1}\]

where \(\mu_{H}\) is the Hall mobility and \(\mu_{d}\) the drift mobility. Their ratio \(r\) is called Hall factor and depends on the details of the scattering mechanism of charge carriers in silicon. It is a pure number of order unity. The following parameterizations were adopted for drift mobility [5] and Hall scattering factor [6, 7, 8] in silicon:

\[\mu_{d}=\frac{v_{s}/E_{c}}{[1+(E/E_{c})^{\beta}]^{1/\beta}} \tag{2}\]

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|} \hline  & Electrons & Holes \\ \(v_{s}\)(cm s\({}^{-1}\)) & \(1.53\cdot 10^{9}\cdot T^{-0.87}\) & \(1.62\cdot 10^{8}\cdot T^{-0.52}\) \\ \(E_{c}\)(V cm\({}^{-1}\)) & \(1.01\cdot T^{1.55}\) & \(1.24\cdot T^{1.68}\) \\ \(\beta\) & \(2.57\cdot 10^{-2}\cdot T^{0.66}\) & \(0.46\cdot T^{0.17}\) \\ \(r\) & \(1.13+0.0008\cdot(T-273)\) & \(0.72-0.0005\cdot(T-273)\) \\ \hline \end{tabular} where T is the absolute temperature and \(E\) the electric field. The Hall factor \(r\) is nearly constant, but the drift mobility shows some dependence on temperature and a huge dependence on electric field. This because the drift velocity of charge carriers is proportional to electric field if this is low (constant mobility), but it saturates for high electric fields (\(\mu\propto 1/E\)). Fig. 1 shows the drift mobility as a function of electric field for \(T\)=273 \({}^{0}\)K. The electric fields in ATLAS silicon sensors are expected to range from about 100 V/300 \(\mu\)m to about 600 V/200 \(\mu\)m (grey area). It can be seen that the drift mobility (andthus Lorentz angle) will be dependent on electric field (that is, on bias voltage and depletion depth) in this region. The mobility of electrons is much higher and more field-dependent than the one of holes. Consequently, the Pixel sensors which collect the electrons will have an higher and more field-dependent Lorentz angle than the SCT sensors which collect the holes.

There is no dependence of \(r\) or \(\mu_{d}\) on doping level until doping concentrations are greater than \(10^{14}\) cm\({}^{-3}\)[5, 6]. Doping concentrations of ATLAS silicon sensors will be of the order of \(10^{12}\) cm\({}^{-3}\) at the beginning of operation. After type inversion, the effective doping concentration of pixels will increase, but even after a fluence of \(10^{15}\) n\({}_{\rm eq}\)cm\({}^{-2}\)(the maximum fluence foreseen for pixels) it will be about \(5\cdot 10^{13}\) cm\({}^{-3}\)[9].

Equations 1 and 2 allow to compute the Lorentz angle value from the temperature and the mean electric field inside the sensor, which is the ratio of bias voltage and depletion depth. This is how the Lorentz angle values reported in this note have been computed.

A detailed computation of charge drift in silicon that takes in account the variation of the electric field inside the silicon sensors, diffusion and threshold effects has also been developed and it is described in [2]. The Lorentz angle value obtained with this procedure agrees within a fraction of degree with the one obtained inserting the mean electric field in eq. 1 and 2.

**Comparison with test beam data.** In Ref. [2] the measurement of the Lorentz angle performed in the Pixel test beams are described and compared to the predictions of the model. A clear dependence of Lorentz angle on electric

field is found, and there is good agreement between the data and the model.

SCT test beam measurements [3] of the Lorentz angle also agree with model predictions for holes. The Lorentz angle is much smaller than for the Pixels, as expected (Fig. 1). This results in a larger relative error, and though the data favour a decrease of the Lorentz angle with electric field, a constant Lorentz angle cannot be ruled out.

## 3 Lorentz angle in ATLAS

A prediction for the value of Lorentz angle in ATLAS can be derived from eq. 1 and 2. As input parameters, only mean electric field (that is, bias voltage and depletion) and temperature are needed.

In fig. 2 the Lorentz angle as a function of bias voltage is reported for Pixel and SCT sensors.

Bias voltages between 80 V and 600 V have been considered for the Pixels, and between 80 and 350 V for the SCT sensors. The bias will increase with time for both, to achieve full depletion despite radiation damage. The following

depletion values have been used to compute the curves reported in the figure: 200 \(\mu\)m for the Pixel B-Layer, 250 \(\mu\)m for Pixel Layers 1,2, 285 \(\mu\)m for SCT. Due to the different thickness, different Pixel layers have not the same Lorentz angle value for the same bias.

Finally, a temperature of 273 \({}^{0}\)K has been used. An operating temperature of 264 \({}^{0}\)K would result in a slightly higher Lorentz angle, the difference being 0.2 \({}^{\circ}\) at 600 V and 0.6 \({}^{\circ}\) at 100 V for the Pixels, and even lower for the SCT.

It is evident that Lorentz angle dependence on bias voltage and thickness for the Pixel detector is not negligible. As cluster multiplicity (and then spatial resolution, jet occupancy,...) depends on the Lorentz angle value, this effect should be taken in account in the simulation, by introducing a Lorentz angle dependent on module bias.

Pixel test beam data [2] show that using the amount of charge collected on each pixel the best spatial resolution (analog resolution) in absence of magnetic field is obtained for incidence angles between 10\({}^{\circ}\) and 15\({}^{\circ}\). For radial tracks in ATLAS the effective incidence angle is given by the difference between the tilt angle (\(\sim 20^{\circ}\) for the Pixel modules) and the Lorentz angle. The best Pixel analog resolution in the \(R\phi\) direction is expected when this difference is between 10\({}^{\circ}\) and 15\({}^{\circ}\), that is, for Lorentz angles between 5\({}^{\circ}\) and 10\({}^{\circ}\). This would occur for bias greater than 200 V (Fig. 2). For lower bias, the effective incidence angle is small and the presence of single pixel clusters limits the analog spatial resolution (as charge interpolation is not possible for such clusters).

Lorentz angle dependence from electric field has also some consequences for alignment, if the ambitious goal of 1 \(\mu\)m precision on module position [1] will prove feasible.

The Lorentz shift of cluster coordinates is \(d/2\tan\Theta_{L}\) where \(d\) is the depletion depth. This Lorentz shift is absorbed in the alignment procedure. If the voltage of a module is changed, the apparent position of that module will also change due to the variation of Lorentz angle. Changing the voltage of a Pixel Layer 1 module from 100 V to 150 V will change the apparent \(R\phi\) position of that module of 6 \(\mu\)m. If the change is made for the entire layer, this would result in an apparent rotation of the layer. The Lorentz angle effect has to be taken in consideration to decouple these changes from real mechanical movements of the detector.

The dependence of Lorentz shift from temperature and bias voltage is maximum for Pixel Layers 1,2 at 100 V. In this conditions the dependence on temperature is 0.15 \(\mu\)m/\({}^{0}\)K and that on bias voltage is 0.1 \(\mu\)m/V.

Conclusions

Lorentz angle in ATLAS will depend on applied bias and sensor thickness. A small dependence on temperature is also present. For the Pixel detector, the Lorentz angle will be 14 \({}^{\circ}\) at 100 V and 4 \({}^{\circ}\) at 600 V for the B-Layer, and one degree higher for the outer two layers. For the SCT detector it will be 4 \({}^{\circ}\) at 100 V and 3 \({}^{\circ}\) at 350 V. Cluster multiplicity and all quantities related to it, included spatial resolution, depend on Lorentz angle value. Its dependence on applied bias has therefore to be taken in account for a proper simulation of detector response. Hit coordinates will be shifted in \(R\phi\) direction by \(d/2\tan\Theta_{L}\) where \(d\) is the sensor depletion depth. This shift will therefore depend on applied bias and temperature. To reach the goal of 1 \(\mu\)m precision in module position after alignment, this effect has to be taken in consideration.
