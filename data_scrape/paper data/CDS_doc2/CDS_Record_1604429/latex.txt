The potential for future measurements of CP violation using the decay \(B_{s}^{0}\to J/\psi\phi\) at ATLAS is discussed. Simulations of future detector layouts and expected LHC conditions at increasing luminosity are used to derive statistical precisions on the weak phase \(\phi_{s}\) for the three data taking periods 2015-2017, 2019-21 and 2023-30\(+\).

Introduction

New phenomena beyond the predictions of the Standard Model (SM) may alter CP violation in B-decays. A channel that is expected to be sensitive to New Physics contributions is the decay \(B_{s}^{0}\to J/\psi\phi\). CP violation in the \(B_{s}^{0}\to J/\psi\phi\) decay occurs due to interference between direct decays and decays occurring through \(B_{s}^{0}-\bar{B}_{s}^{0}\) mixing. The oscillation frequency of \(B_{s}^{0}\to J/\psi\phi\) meson mixing is characterized by the mass difference \(\Delta M_{s}\) of the heavy (\(B_{H}\)) and light (\(B_{L}\)) mass eigenstates. The CP-violating phase \(\phi_{s}\) is defined as the weak phase difference between the \(B_{s}^{0}-\bar{B}_{s}^{0}\) mixing amplitude and the \(b\to c\bar{c}s\) decay amplitude. In the SM the phase \(\phi_{s}\) is small and can be related to CKM quark mixing matrix elements via the relation \(\phi_{s}\approx-2\beta_{s}\), with \(\beta_{s}=\arg[-(V_{ts}V_{tb}^{*})/(V_{cs}V_{cb}^{*})]\); a value of \(\phi_{s}\approx-2\beta_{s}=-0.0368\pm 0.0018\) rad [1] is extracted in the SM.

Flavour-tagged measurements of \(\phi_{s}\) at LHC have been performed by LHCb [1] and ATLAS [2] using data collected in 2011. The ATLAS measurement, using the \(B_{s}^{0}\to J/\psi\phi\) channel, is \(\phi_{s}=0.12\pm 0.25(\text{stat.})\pm 0.11(\text{syst.})\) rad. The LHCb value, obtained by combining decay channels \(B_{s}^{0}\to J/\psi\phi\), \(B_{s}^{0}\to J/\psi K^{+}K^{-}(f_{0})\) and \(B_{s}^{0}\to J/\psi\pi^{+}\pi^{-}\), is \(\phi_{s}=0.01\pm 0.07(\text{stat.})\pm 0.01(\text{syst.})\) rad.

It is clear that, whilst no significant deviation from the SM prediction is observed, neither measurement is close to the theoretical uncertainties on the SM prediction for \(\phi_{s}\) and so no definitive statement can be made at present. It is important to note that the systematic as well as the statistical uncertainties on these measurement will benefit strongly from additional data, since some of the systematics arise due to the limited number of events available for data-driven techniques (especially flavour tagging). Whilst the 2012 data currently being analysed will improve the situation, it is likely that very much higher luminosities will be needed to settle the issue, and this motivates the continuation of these studies into LHC Run 2 and the High Luminosity LHC run (HL-LHC).

As a general purpose detector with central geometry, ATLAS relies on utilising the full luminosity provided by the LHC to provide as many \(J/\psi\) candidates as possible, leading to similarly large exclusive \(B\to J/\psi\) decay samples. During 2011 ATLAS was able to collect similar numbers of \(B_{s}^{0}\to J/\psi\phi\) signal events to LHCb, despite the latter having a much higher acceptance for B-production. The continuation of this will rely on sufficient bandwidth being made available for \(J/\psi\) triggers.

This document presents a preliminary estimate of the precision that ATLAS could achieve on \(\phi_{s}\) measurements during Run 2 and HL-LHC. In addition to the much higher number of events which will be available, a particularly important consideration is the extensive upgrade programme to the inner tracking detector planned both before Run 2 and HL-LHC, which will be shown to have a very significant impact on these measurements.

The document is laid out as follows: after a brief description in sections 2 and 3 of the simulated events and reconstruction of decay candidates used in this study, the resulting performance (especially in terms of proper decay time resolution) is reported in section 4. An estimate of the reconstruction efficiency and background is presented in section 5. These characteristics are brought together in section 6 to provide an estimate of the precision for \(\phi_{s}\) achievable after Run 2 and with HL-LHC.

## 2 Preparation of simulated data

The Monte Carlo samples used in this analysis have been simulated in two future ATLAS detector layouts. The first one will be operating during Run 2 [3] (in this note referred to as "ATLAS-IBL"). The second layout is the Phase-II Upgrade detector operating at HL-LHC [4] (in the current note referred to as "ATLAS-ITK").

With ATLAS-IBL the inner tracker contains a new Insertable B-Layer (IBL), which is a fourth layer added to the present Pixel Detector between a new beam pipe and the current inner pixel layer (B-layer). In this layout the innermost silicon cylinder will have an inner radius \(\mathcal{O}(35)\) mm from the beam line.

The IBL is being installed during the LS1 shutdown and will be active until the complete replacement of the ATLAS inner tracker, which will happen in the long shutdown LS3 in preparation for the subsequent phase, referred to as the High Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC). The design requirements for the ATLAS IBL have assumed an integrated luminosity of 550 fb\({}^{-1}\) and a peak luminosity of \(3\times 10^{34}\) cm\({}^{2}\)s\({}^{-1}\). The total luminosities integrated before and during collisions at design luminosity are difficult to forecast; however, the prediction is around 340 fb\({}^{-1}\) at the end of the run with Phase-I upgraded detector.

The Phase-II upgrade of the ATLAS detector (ATLAS-ITK) will allow operation at five times the nominal LHC luminosity, \(5\times 10^{34}\) cm\({}^{2}\)s\({}^{-1}\), and the full exploitation of the physics accessible with a total integrated luminosity of up to 3000 fb\({}^{-1}\). The increased instantaneous luminosity at the HL-LHC results in the expected mean number of interactions per bunch crossing (BX) increasing from 55 at \(2\times 10^{34}\) cm\({}^{2}\)s\({}^{-1}\) to 140 at \(5\times 10^{34}\) cm\({}^{2}\)s\({}^{-1}\) (assuming a bunch crossing time of 25 ns). To allow for some safety margin, the design studies for the proposed upgrades assume a maximum instantaneous luminosity of \(7\times 10^{34}\) cm\({}^{2}\)s\({}^{-1}\) with 200 pile-up events. In the ITK inner tracker a pixel granularity of 25 x 150 \(\mu\)m\({}^{2}\) is being targeted for the two innermost layers, that will be at radii of 39 mm and 78 mm in the barrel region of the detector.

The ATLAS trigger menus for future years are being optimised. As a working point for the current study it is assumed that the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) thresholds of each of the muons in the \(J/\psi\) trigger will be 6 GeV (or 11 GeV) during 2015-17 and 11 GeV thresholds for 2019-21 and HL-LHC. Determination of these thresholds is based on studies of trigger rates at the LHC instantaneous luminosity of \(2\cdot 10^{34}\)cm\({}^{-2}\)s\({}^{-1}\) and centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV (thus accounting for the higher production cross sections). It was found that B-physics triggers based on 6 GeV muon \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) thresholds (with additional topological selection) would have a rate at the edge of the acceptable B-physics bandwidth. The rate of the 11 GeV based B-physics triggers would be safely below the expected B-physics bandwidth, providing a conservative trigger scenario. Since the corresponding trigger chains and features are not implemented yet, in this study the trigger was simply emulated by the corresponding offline muon \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) cuts.

A summary of the LHC and detector conditions expected during the future periods that were considered in this study and used in the simulation of events is given in Table 1.

Signal \(B_{s}^{0}\to J/\psi\phi\) events are generated using Pythia8 with a centre-of-mass energy of 14 TeV. Other Pythia8 parameters were CTEQ6L1 - LO with leading order (LO) \(\alpha_{s}\). Reflecting the trigger working points mentioned above, two sets of events are produced: first requesting that the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) of each of the two \(J/\psi\) muons is larger than 6 GeV, and secondly with \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) larger than 11 GeV. The 6 GeV events are then simulated for expected conditions with ATLAS-IBL. The 11 GeV \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) sample is simulated twice: firstly in the same conditions as the 6 GeV set; secondly in HL-LHC conditions using the ATLAS ITK layout.

The simulated signal events are digitized to mimic the raw format which is produced by the triggers

in the case of real data, and mixed with simulated minimum bias events to replicate conditions of pile-up. The IBL samples are digitized with a Poisson average \(<\)\(\mu\)\(>\) of 60 pile-up events, whereas the ITK samples are produced with a pile-up \(<\)\(\mu\)\(>\) of 200, reflecting conditions expected in the HL-LHC era. Table 2 summarises the configuration of the Monte Carlo (MC) samples used in this study.

The digitized events are then reconstructed, with the Inner Detector (ID) track reconstruction settings adjusted to the level of pile-up. The IBL samples are reconstructed with tracking settings identical to those used in 2012, whereas the ITK samples use tighter cuts and a higher minimum \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) threshold on each track. Finally, 8 TeV \(B_{s}^{0}\to J/\psi\phi\) events simulated with the current ATLAS layout, digitized with 2012 pileup conditions and reconstructed with the current settings, are also used. A list of simulated samples is given in Table 2.

## 3 Candidate selection

The selection of candidates follows the same criteria as in Ref. [2], as described below. In order to be included in the analysis, reconstructed \(B_{s}^{0}\) MC events are required to contain at least one pair of oppositely charged muon candidates. The muon candidates may either be _combined_, that is, comprise a single reconstructed track built from hits in both the inner tracker and muon spectrometer, or _segment tagged_, which means an ID track that is tagged as being a muon by associated hits in the muon spectrometer [5]. The former tend to be of higher purity since there are usually more muon spectrometer hits associated with them.

In this analysis the muon parameters and kinematics are taken from the ID measurement alone (even in the case of combined muons). The track pairs are fitted to a common vertex and accepted for further consideration if the vertex fit results in \(\chi^{2}/\mathrm{d.o.f.}<10\). The invariant mass of the muon pair is calculated from the ID track parameters after the vertex fit.

To account for varying mass resolution in different regions of the detector, the \(J/\psi\) candidates are divided into three subsets according to the pseudorapidity \(\eta\) of the muons. A maximum likelihood fit is used to extract the \(J/\psi\) mass and the corresponding resolution for these three subsets. When both muons have \(|\eta|<1.05\), the di-muon invariant mass must fall in the range \((2.959-3.229)\) GeV to be accepted as a \(J/\psi\) candidate. When one muon has \(1.05<|\eta|<2.5\) and the other muon \(|\eta|<1.05\), the corresponding signal region is \((2.913-3.273)\) GeV. For the third subset, where both muons have \(1.05<|\eta|<2.5\), the signal region is \((2.852-3.332)\) GeV. In each case the signal region is defined so as to retain 99.8% of the \(J/\psi\) candidates identified in the fits.

The candidates for \(\phi\to K^{+}K^{-}\) are reconstructed from all pairs of oppositely charged tracks with \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>0.5\) GeV and \(|\eta|<2.5\) that are not identified as muons. Candidates for \(B_{s}^{0}\to J/\psi(\mu^{+}\mu^{-})\phi(K^{+}K^{-})\) are sought by fitting the tracks for each combination of \(J/\psi\rightarrow\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\) and \(\phi\to K^{+}K^{-}\) to a common vertex. All four tracks are required to have at least one hit in the pixel detector and at least two hits in the silicon strip detector. The fit is further constrained by fixing the invariant mass calculated from the two muon tracks to the world average \(J/\psi\) mass [6]. These quadruplets of tracks are accepted for further analysis if the vertex fit has a \(\chi^{2}/\mathrm{d.o.f.}<3\), the fitted \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) of each track from \(\phi\to K^{+}K^{-}\) is greater than

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{l|l|c|c} \hline Process & MC cuts & Geometry & \(<\)\(\mu\)\(>\) & MC events \\ \hline \(B_{s}^{0}\to J/\psi(\mu^{+}\mu^{-})\phi(K^{+}K^{-})\) & \(p_{\mathrm{T}}(\mu^{\pm})>3.5\) GeV & 2012 & 20 & 40 \(\cdot 10^{6}\) \\ \(B_{s}^{0}\to J/\psi(\mu^{+}\mu^{-})\phi(K^{+}K^{-})\) & \(p_{\mathrm{T}}(\mu^{\pm})>6\) GeV & IBL & 60 & 50 \(\cdot 10^{3}\) \\ \(B_{s}^{0}\to J/\psi(\mu^{+}\mu^{-})\phi(K^{+}K^{-})\) & \(p_{\mathrm{T}}(\mu^{\pm})>11\) GeV & IBL & 60 & 50 \(\cdot 10^{3}\) \\ \(B_{s}^{0}\to J/\psi(\mu^{+}\mu^{-})\phi(K^{+}K^{-})\) & \(p_{\mathrm{T}}(\mu^{\pm})>11\) GeV & ITK & 200 & 50 \(\cdot 10^{3}\) \\ \hline \end{tabular}

## 4 \(B_{s}^{0}\) signal performance characteristics

The precision of the CP violation measurement in rapidly oscillating \(B_{s}^{0}\) meson decays depends strongly on the tracking and vertexing precision of ID tracks. Performance parameters relevant for \(B_{s}^{0}\) measurements are extracted from MC for the new layouts and compared to 2012 conditions. They serve as an input to a "toy" MC that is used to estimate the precision of the future measurements with different detector layouts and conditions. In this regard the proper decay time resolution is one of the main performance parameters of interest. In ATLAS the proper decay time \(t\) for \(B_{s}^{0}\) meson candidates is determined from the expression:

\[t=\frac{L_{xy}\ M_{{}_{B}}}{c\ p_{\mathrm{T}_{B}}},\]

where \(p_{\mathrm{T}_{B}}\) is the reconstructed transverse momentum of the \(B_{s}^{0}\) meson candidate and \(M_{{}_{B}}\) denotes the world average mass value [6] of the \(B_{s}^{0}\) meson (5.3663 GeV). The transverse decay length \(L_{xy}\) is the displacement in the transverse plane of the \(B_{s}^{0}\) meson decay vertex with respect to the primary vertex, projected onto the direction of the \(B_{s}^{0}\) transverse momentum. The position of the primary vertex (PV) used to calculate this quantity is refitted following the removal of the tracks used to reconstruct the \(B_{s}^{0}\) meson candidate. In each event several PV are reconstructed and the multiplicity of these vertices depends on pileup conditions, as is shown in Figure 3.

The presence of multiple PV necessitates an estimate of the PV at which the \(B_{s}^{0}\) meson is produced. The variable used is a three-dimensional impact parameter \(a_{0}\), which is calculated as the distance between the line extrapolated from the reconstructed \(B_{s}^{0}\) meson vertex in the direction of the \(B_{s}^{0}\) momentum, and each primary vertex candidate. The primary vertex with the smallest \(a_{0}\) is chosen.

With the upgrades of the ID the vertex reconstruction is expected to improve significantly, as was documented in studies in Refs. [3, 4]. In this document the impact of the upgrades on exclusive B-decays is presented for the first time. The \(B_{s}^{0}\) proper decay time resolution, \(\sigma_{\tau}\), as a function of transverse momentum \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) of the \(B_{s}^{0}\) meson is shown in Fig 1 for the three detector layouts: current ATLAS layout with pileup conditions of 2012; the IBL layout with average number of pileup events \(<\)\(\mu\)\(>\)=60; and the ITK layout with \(<\)\(\mu\)\(>\)=200. The \(\sigma_{\tau}\) in both IBL and ITK is expected to improve by 30% relative to 2012, in corresponding \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) intervals. The improvement is achieved with the installation of the IBL, that will be available for use in 2015. Since \(\sigma_{\tau}\) is approximately a hyperbolically decreasing function of \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\), another apparent improvement in the average proper decay time resolution is simply due to moving to higher \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) values due to increasing muon trigger acceptance thresholds; this is documented in Figure 2. With high pileup conditions there is the possibility that the \(\sigma_{\tau}\) may deteriorate with increasing multiplicity of reconstructed PV. The results shown in Fig 3 demonstrate the stability of \(\sigma_{\tau}\) against the number of reconstructed primary vertices in \(B_{s}^{0}\) events.

## 5 Estimation of signal yield and background level

### Cross section at 14 TeV

To estimate the signal yields, the cross section of the process \(b\bar{b}\to J/\psi X\) at 14 TeV is assumed to be twice as large as at 7 TeV [7]. The same factor is assumed for the direct \(J/\psi\) production cross section in \(pp\to J/\psi X\). It is also supposed that the cross section ratio of the \(J/\psi\) produced from beauty decays and in prompt production varies with \(p_{\rm T}\) in the same way at both 7 TeV and 14 TeV energies. The ATLAS analysis does not apply a decay time cut to the \(B_{s}^{0}\to J/\psi\phi\) candidates, so the \(pp\to J/\psi X\) background is kept and taken into account in the fit.

### Signal yield

Estimation of the signal yield is based on a combination of real data from 2012 and simulated events for future layouts. Firstly, three subsets of 2012 data were created: all recorded \(B_{s}^{0}\) candidates ("all"); candidates with \(p_{\rm T}\) of both muons \(>\) 6 GeV ("6-6"); and finally candidates with \(p_{\rm T}\) of both muons \(>\) 11 GeV ("11-11"). For each subset the number of signal events N\({}_{sig}\) is determined by applying a fit to the \(B_{s}^{0}\) mass distributions. Secondly, each N\({}_{sig}\) is corrected by a factor taking into account signal efficiencies from MC simulated with future layouts, relative to the efficiencies in the 2012 MC simulation. Each N\({}_{sig}\) is then multiplied by a factor 2 to account for the difference in cross sections at centre-of-mass energies of 14 TeV and 7 TeV, as described above. The N\({}_{sig}\) values extracted for each period, expressed as the number of signal events per fb\({}^{-1}\), are shown in Table 3. Finally, N\({}_{sig}\) values are calculated for the integrated luminosities expected in each period, and are given in the same table.

### Background level

Since the background rejection is high, background events were not simulated due to limited computing resources; however the background level is estimated using the combinatorial background in the signal event samples. To validate this method, it was applied to 2012 MC simulated signal events and the estimated background level was found to be consistent with that determined from 2012 data. The combinatorial background in the signal events consists of \(J/\psi\) candidates combined with two charged hadrons not originating from the signal decay \(B_{s}^{0}\to J/\psi(\mu^{+}\mu^{-})\phi(K^{+}K^{-})\). These background candidates were required to pass the same selection criteria as the signal, described in section 3. The fraction of combinatorial background found in the signal samples was then scaled using the cross sections for \(pp\to J/\psi X\)

The vertical axis gives an average value of per-candidate proper decay time errors for \(B_{s}^{0}\) candidates within the \(p_{\rm T}\) bin. Left and right plots are equivalent; the horizontal axis shows \(p_{\rm T}\) in the left plot, and \(1/p_{\rm T}\) in the right plot.

and \(b\bar{b}\to J/\psi X\). The values of the expected background level (given as the overall number of events in the analysis and the number of signal events) are given in Table 3.

## 6 Estimation of the measurement precision

Pseudo-experiments are used to assess the performance of the \(B_{s}^{0}\) measurement using parameters extracted from fully simulated events. A program (a "toy" MC) generates signal and background events that are subsequently fitted with the same parametrization as real data. Events are generated according to models consisting of the following components:

* **Mass** The signal mass is generated from the world average \(B_{s}^{0}\) mass convolved by Gaussian functions, with widths using per-candidate mass errors. The per-candidate errors are taken from data (or from fully simulated events for future layouts). The background mass distribution is generated according to a first order polynomial function, with parameters taken from data. For future layouts 2012 data are used after applying \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) cuts of 6 or 11 GeV on the muon pairs.
* signal** The \(B_{s}^{0}\) and \(\bar{B_{s}^{0}}\) proper decay time and angular amplitudes are generated according to the probability density function described in Ref. [8], Table 1. Physics parameters entering this function are taken from the SM values. Proper time distributions are convolved with Gaussians with widths equal to per-candidate errors from data (or simulation for the future layouts).
* background** Combinatorial background lifetimes are constructed using three exponential functions plus one Gaussian model described in Ref. [8]. The background angular distributions are generated using sidebands from 2012 data. Background shapes for future measurements are derived from the same 2012 data after applying \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) cuts of 6 and 11 GeV to the muons.

Figure 2: Distribution of the \(B_{s}^{0}\) proper decay time resolution for \(B_{s}^{0}\) events simulated for: current ATLAS layout and trigger (typical muon \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) threshold 4 GeV) and pileup conditions of 2012 (red), IBL ATLAS layout with average number of pileup events, \(<\)\(\mu\)\(>\)=60 (6 GeV \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) threshold of the muons - green, 11 GeV \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) threshold of the muons - magenta) and ITK layout with, \(<\)\(\mu\)\(>\)=200 and 11 GeV \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) threshold of the muons (blue).

* **Flavour tagging** Determination of the initial b-flavour charge (referred to as "tag") of the \(B^{0}_{s}\) meson has significant impact on the \(\phi_{s}\) measurement precision. Reconstructing properties of the complementary B-decay in an event, the tag can be only extracted on a statistical basis, represented by a probability of a \(B^{0}_{s}\) candidate having initial \(B^{0}_{s}\) flavour charge (referred to as "tag-decision"). As in the 2011 data analysis [2], two tagging algorithms are used: a muon jet-charge tagger and a b-tagged jet-charge tagger. The weighted charge of these objects determines the tag-decision. The parametrization of the tagging algorithms follows the 2011 data analysis as well. A tag decision for the signal is generated according to tag decision distributions taken from the simulated MC samples for future conditions. For 2011 and 2012 the signal tag decisions are generated according to distributions extracted from fits to real events from a signal region after a sideband subtraction. The tag decision for the background is generated using events in the \(B^{0}_{s}\) mass sidebands from 2012 data. For future periods the 2012 sidebands data are used as well, after applying the relevant cuts on \(p_{\rm T}\) of the muons.

## 7 Results

Table 3 summarises the estimated statistical precision on \(\phi_{s}\) for the LHC periods under consideration. To validate the model, it is also applied to 2011 with parametrizations driven by the 2011 data. In this cross-check the estimated statistical error \(\sigma(\phi_{s})\) is identical with that obtained from the full analysis of 2011 data [2]. The value for 2012 in the table is also derived using the MC model. The full analysis for this period is underway.

From the values obtained for future periods, it is clear that the ATLAS sensitivity on \(\phi_{s}\) will improve as soon as the IBL becomes operational in 2015, due to the better proper decay time resolution for \(B^{0}_{s}\). Two options for the muon trigger thresholds presented in Table 3 for 2015-2017, (6-6 GeV) and (11-11 GeV), represent an optimistic and rather conservative option for the trigger scenarios in this period. Potential gains for 2023-30\(+\) rely on both the improved performance of new ITK detector as well as on high integrated luminosity.

### Systematic uncertainties

The systematic uncertainties will benefit from the larger data samples, since some of them arise due to limited number of events available for data-driven techniques. The systematic error of the 2011 data measurement [2] comprises of: uncertainties in initial \(B^{0}_{s}\) flavour charge tagging, likelihood fit modeling, trigger efficiency determination, contribution of \(B^{0}_{d}\to J/\psi K^{*}\) decays and Inner Detector alignment. The tagging is calibrated using \(B^{+}\) decays from data, thus a larger dataset improves its uncertainty. Also the fit model can incorporate a more detailed description with more input data, namely in the description of combinatorial background angles and \(p_{\rm T}({\rm B})\) dependence. Eventually the contribution of \(B^{0}_{d}\to J/\psi K^{*}\) decays can be extracted from the fit instead of being fixed with large uncertainty on its branching ratio. The trigger efficiency determination and Inner Detector alignment systematics are both data-driven, however their sizes rather depend on the changes in the trigger tracking and alignment algorithms related to the ATLAS Inner Detector upgrades, which cannot be estimated now.

A conservative upper bound on the total systematic uncertainty would arise when assuming that all but the tagging systematics remain unchanged, while the one related to the tagging scales down with the size of the data sample. Such an estimate would set an upper limit on the total \(\phi_{s}\) systematic of 0.04.

## 8 Conclusions

The ATLAS sensitivity for measuring the CP violating phase \(\phi_{s}\) from \(B^{0}_{s}\to J/\psi\phi\) decay is estimated for future LHC periods. This sensitivity is expected to improve from 2015 onwards with the new IBL layout of the ATLAS Inner Detector. Two muon trigger menu options given for 2015-2017 represent optimistic and conservative estimates. Subsequent improvements in sensitivity will depend strongly on the actual trigger menus, that are being still optimised. The estimated gain from the data-taking in the high-luminosity LHC period is an improvement by a factor of nearly 3 in \(\phi_{s}\) precision compared to the measurements in the preceding LHC periods.
