Results are reported on the electron analysis performed with the 1998 Module0 data, using the new DIRAC digitizers.

Introduction

## 2 Experimental Setup

The ATLAS Barrel Tile Calorimeter Module0 was tested in the H8 beam of the CERN SPS accelerator, in the period June-July 1998. The module was the one used in the 1996 test beam, but equipped with a new batch of scintillators and with different types of WLS fibres (Pol.Hi.Tech on the positive \(\eta\) side and Bicron on the negative \(\eta\) side). 5 DIRAC Digitizer boards - each one with six channels - were installed for the first time, resulting in 29 working channel. The boards were located in Drawer A (on the negative \(\eta\) side) and were read by 45 PMTs.

## 3 Data

Several runs were taken with electrons at 90\({}^{\rm deg}\), shooting against a tile center, taking one tile size per sampling (namely, tile #2, #7). After the reparation

In each run between 1 and 1.5 Kevts were collected. The data available are listed in table 1

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|} \hline Energy (GeV) & Ntuple & Evts & Tile \\
**50** & 44373 & & 2 \\  & 44374 & & 2 \\  & 44370 & & 5 \\  & 44371 & & 5 \\  & 44372 & & 5 \\ \hline
**100** & 44321 & & 2 \\  & 44325 & & 2 \\  & 44322 & & 7 \\  & 44323 & & 10 \\  & 44324 & & 10 \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
