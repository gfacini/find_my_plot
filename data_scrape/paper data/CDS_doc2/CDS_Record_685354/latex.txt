###### Abstract

Following major changes in the Muon Spectrometer layout and in the Level-1 trigger scheme, new acceptance curves and trigger windows in the Muon Barrel have been calculated for different thresholds. Efficiency curves have been produced accordingly and event rates have been estimates for some physics channels.

Introduction

In this note new acceptance curves, trigger (or coincidence) windows and efficiencies curves for the Level-1 Muon Trigger System (layout O) in the Barrel are given. Trigger performances for significant physics channels are presented.

This update is mainly due to the relevant changes occurred both in the trigger chambers and in the scheme since the Level-1 Trigger TDR. In fact, the evolution of the Muon Spectrometer layout (from version M to O) affected in a significant way the trigger chambers (RPC): several different sizes are now defined, to better cope with the complex geometry. The appropriate numbers and pitches of readout strips have been determined accordingly. Furthermore, for increasing the geometrical coverage, an overlap in \(\eta\) between the two RPC chambers mapping a MDT chamber has been decided.

The trigger logic has been changed as well: the pivot station, i.e. the station whose fired strips steer the triggering process, has been moved from the inner to the middle one. Fired strips in coincidence are looked for in the inner (for Low-\(p_{T}\) trigger) and outer (for High-\(p_{T}\)) stations.

## 2 The Level-1 Trigger System in the Muon Spectrometer Barrel

The Level-1 Muon Trigger System is based on dedicated processors that analyze signals coming from fast tracking chambers (RPC).

The trigger chambers belonging to each sector are radially organized in three stations: the Low-\(p_{T}\) coincidence station, the pivot station, and the High-\(p_{T}\) coincidence station. A station is made of two detector layers, each one equipped on the two sides with orthogonal readout strips, parallel to the beam (\(\phi\) strips) and parallel to the magnetic field (\(z\) or \(\eta\) strips). Data from \(\eta\) strips allow to reconstruct the curvature of muon tracks in the bending plane (\(r-z\) view), while data from \(\phi\) strips allow to reconstruct the direction of muon tracks in the other projection (\(r-\phi\) view).

Each time a strip on a pivot station is fired, the trigger logic searches the other stations for a suitable number of fired strips that are compatible with the trajectory of a prompt muon, i.e. close enough to the straight line identified by the center of the hit strip on the pivot station and the center of the interaction region (henceforth called "infinite momentum track"). Close enough is defined by determining the ensembles of strips in the inner and outer stations (trigger windows), inside which coincidences have to be looked for. The width of the trigger window in the bending plane sets a \(p_{T}\) threshold on the accepted muons.

The large \(p_{T}\) range of muon signatures that have to be identified, together with the need to maintain the trigger window below a certain size, have lead to implement two logic schemes: one for low \(p_{T}\) muons and one for high \(p_{T}\) muons as shown in figure 1. The Low-\(p_{T}\) trigger requires a coincidence in three out of the four detector layers of the first two trigger stations, while the High-\(p_{T}\) trigger requires a coincidence in one layer of the third station in addition to a Low-\(p_{T}\) coincidence. The requirements on the strip multiplicity, together with the fact that the two projections \(r-\phi\) and \(r-z\) are treated independently and then combined, significantly reduce the fake trigger rate due to cavern background.

### Trigger chambers

Resistive Plate Chambers (RPC) are strip detectors with time resolution \(\sigma_{T}=1.5\) ns that can tolerate particles fluxes up to 1 \(\mathrm{KHz/cm^{2}}\). For a more accurate description, see the Level-1 Technical Design Report [1]. Here only some characteristics relevant for the Level-1 trigger algorithm are presented.

Each trigger chamber consists of two superimposed sensitive volumes (trigger planes) both equipped with \(\eta\) and \(\phi\) read-out strips having a constant pitch in the range of \(2.5\div 3.5\) cm. A suitable number of RPC chambers of proper size exactly map the surface of a MDT chamber and is held in place by an aluminum cage. A trigger station consists in a sequence of such structures along the z direction that covers a MDT sector (see figure 1).

To avoid dead areas between contiguous trigger planes, the RPC chambers in the same cage overlap in the z direction, as shown in figure 2: the size (6. cm) has been chosen such as to be adequate for particles with incident angles up to 40\({}^{\circ}\) (\(|\eta|\simeq 1\)). In the \(r-\phi\) view, no overlapping is foreseen and this leads to a dead region of about 1.4 cm along the axis of MDT chamber.

With respect to the Level-1 trigger system, the most relevant change from layout M to O is the overlap in z of RPC chambers. This introduces a radial shift between the trigger planes up to 6 cm, that is about 10% of the lever arm available for the Low-\(p_{T}\) trigger. As a consequence, the coincidence windows for Low-\(p_{T}\) (and to a smaller extent for High-\(p_{T}\)) trigger depend on \(\eta\) in a complex way, as it will be shown later.

Moreover, for increasing the geometrical acceptance, special units to cover the holes around the ribs in the Small sectors have been introduced. This raises the efficiency plateau of the trigger system and the overall trigger rate as well.

The new layout for a Small sector is shown in figure 3.

Figure 1: Level 1 muon trigger scheme in the barrel region. Muon selection exploits the rough estimation of the muon \(p_{T}\) performed via a fast coincidence between trigger stations. The Low-\(p_{T}\) trigger logic requires a coincidence between the pivot and the Low-\(p_{T}\) stations; the High-\(p_{T}\) trigger logic requires a valid Low-\(p_{T}\) trigger plus the coincidence between the pivot and the High-\(p_{T}\) stations.

### Trigger logic

A new trigger scheme has been adopted with respect to the one used for the Level-1 TDR [1]: the pivot station has been interchanged with the Low-\(p_{T}\) coincidence station and is now the middle one. The Low- and High \(p_{T}\) coincidence stations are presently the innermost and the outermost ones.

The signals from the pivot station steer the trigger logic: they are sent to the Low-\(p_{T}\) coincidence matrices (CM)[2] to be confirmed by signals coming from the Low-\(p_{T}\) coincidence station (see figure 4). The confirmed pivot signals are then sent to the High-\(p_{T}\) CMs to be confirmed by signals coming from the High-\(p_{T}\) station.

The size of the CMs (32 x 64 input channels) is large enough to accommodate in one dimension the maximum number of strips in a pivot chamber and in the other dimension the set of strips (possibly coming from different chambers) that maps all the coincidence windows associated to the strips of the pivot chamber. An example of RPC cabling is shown in figure 5, that gives the connection map for the odd CM boards of a Large sector. A strip on the pivot planes is connected with only one CM. On the contrary, strips on coincidence planes may be connected to several matrices, because trigger windows overlap.

The coincidences between signals are searched in a time gate of \(\sim 20\) ns. To take into account the propagation time of signals coming from different stations, programmable delays are applied.

In a CM, the couples of strips in the two dimensions hit by infinite momentum tracks define a kind of line: a \(p_{T}\) threshold is implemented by defining a coincidence road of suitable width around that line. In other words, the center line identifies prompt muons of infinite momentum, while the road open a trigger window which accepts muons with \(p_{T}\) above a certain threshold.

The number of trigger planes required for a valid coincidence (majority logic) and the roads are programmable. Three thresholds can be programmed in a coincidence matrix; this flexibility allows to optimize the selection of physics channels against the overall trigger rate. As of now, the \(p_{T}\) thresholds

e \(p_{T}\) scheme. In case of large background one threshold of the High-\(p_{T}\) trigger can be used to further confirm the Low-\(p_{T}\) trigger and increase the trigger robustness against background [4].

The read-out segmentation maps the trigger logic on muon chambers and is implemented to be as modular as possible, in order to have the same electronics components repeated in most of the muon detector. This segmentation provides also information for building RoIs associated to a Level-1 trigger.

Figure 6 shows how the coincidence matrix read-out is mapped on RPC and MDT chambers:

* in the \(r-z\) projection the pivot input of a CM consists of the signals coming from all the strips of a RPC chamber: typically four \(r-z\) matrices cover a MDT chamber;
* in the \(r-\phi\) projection the pivot input of a CM consists of the hardwired OR of the signals coming from the two neighbor chambers in the same cage. Typically four \(r-\phi\) matrices cover a MDT chamber. Some optimization studies to solve special cases (RPC around ribs into small sector) are still ongoing [5].

The bunch crossing identification is made interlacing the primary clock at 40 MHz with the matrix output. To synchronize the whole system, the spectrometer is divided in zones such that the clock propagation time inside is less than the bunch crossing time. The matrices are held in phase with a programmable delay added to the output signal.

The overall trigger logic for the barrel is divided into 64 logic sectors which collect data coming from a region \(\Delta\eta\times\Delta\phi=1.0\times 0.2\). Inside a logic sector the CMs are grouped four by four (two \(r-z\) matrices and two \(r-\phi\) matrices) into PADs, onboard circuits that associate the fired matrices in the two projections, solve the overlap ambiguities coming from the \(z\) overlap of RPC chambers and collects data for identifying the RoIs. The smallest Level-1 RoI is defined by the intersection of CMs in both view (see figure 6) and provides a trigger tower with granularity \(\Delta\eta\times\Delta\phi=0.1\times 0.2\). The data processed by the sector logic are then sent to the central muon processor which provides the correct trigger multiplicity for all the thresholds to the Level-1 central trigger processor.

## 3 Simulation of the trigger system

A new simulation of the Level-1 muon trigger system has been developed to take into account the layout changes and the evolution of the trigger logic. Object oriented techniques has been employed, in order to ease future changes in the trigger model.

The tracking of particles in the ATLAS detector has been simulated using DICE [6], where the response of the trigger chambers up to the read-out electronics has been reproduced. The access to the digitized data takes place in ATRIG [7], a package developed for studying the trigger selection criteria that hosts the Level-1 algorithm.

In the following two sections some details concerning the simulation of the trigger chambers and the trigger logic are presented.

### Trigger chambers

The position and the structure of the RPCs are derived from an ASCII database, AMDB [8], which contains all the information needed to simulate a given layout of the muon spectrometer (for this work the version O.08 has been used). Support structures are described as well as inactive volumes. Dead zones in sensitive volumes, i.e. the border surrounding the gas gap and the matrix of spacers used to maintain the gap constant, are reproduced in detail, as they contribute to spoil the geometric acceptance of the chambers.

The formation of signals in the simulated detector, i.e. the conversion from hits to digits, has been modeled according to the behavior of real trigger chambers measured in laboratory tests. Intrinsic hit efficiency of each RPC plane for crossing charged particles, relevant for the acceptance of the trigger system, has been set to \(\sim\) 99%. The size of the clusters of contiguous fired strips produced by charge

Figure 6: Middle station of a standard octant (chambers around ribs are not shown) of the Muon Spectrometer showing the segmentation of the Level-1 trigger logic on the RPC pivot plane. The read-out of the coincidence matrices are mapped on the RPC chambers for both views. The arrangement of coincidence matrices into PADs and into trigger logic sectors are also shown.

spread and cross talk has been modeled to be 1 in \(\sim 80\) of the cases, 2 in \(\sim 20\), again according to experimental results. The impact of the cluster size on the trigger response is twofold: multiple triggers can be produced by one particle and the muon momentum can be incorrectly estimated.

The propagation time of signals on read-out strips is not simulated yet.

### Trigger logic

The simulation of the trigger logic is not intended to exactly reproduce the behavior of the hardware components: for efficiency purposes, only the main system functionalities and the results are correctly simulated.

The digits produced by DICE are decoded (i.e. associated to the space point that corresponds to the center of the fired strip) and grouped according to the trigger plane to which they belong. Each fired strip on the pivot planes activates a search in the coincidence planes for fired strips compatible with a muon track. To identify such strips the algorithm applies the same geometric principle, shown in figure 7, in both view.

The direction of the infinite momentum track crossing the fired strip on the pivot station is evaluated and the corresponding intersection points (extrapolated points) with the coincidence stations are determined. Then, for each fired strip on a coincidence plane the distance \(\Delta z=center\;of\;hit\;strip-extrapolated\;point\) is computed. According to the above definition of \(\Delta z\), in the Low-\(p_{T}\) station negative muons have negative \(\Delta z\), whereas positive muon have positive \(\Delta z\). In the High-\(p_{T}\) station the sign of \(\Delta z\) is inverted.

Fired strips, placed in the two different trigger planes of a station, are associated using the same OR schema that has been implemented in the electronics. No declustering procedure is activated because it is ineffective with the presently modeled cluster size: indeed, the reducing algorithm operates on clusters made of three or more contiguous strips.

The role of the coincidence matrix is simulated by selecting fired strips on the pivot station such that in the coincidence planes fired strips with a \(\Delta z\) less than the window size are found. The majority

Figure 7: Simulation of the trigger logic.

logic is applied taking into account the number of associated strips which contributed to a \(\Delta z\). Such process is performed in both view and then the selected strips are associated to each other for building the complete trigger response.

In order of correctly matching the orthogonal views, the CMs operating on the z signals and the \(\phi\) signals of the same pivot chamber are mapped in a PAD units. This allows to generate the correct trigger multiplicity and to identify the corresponding RoIs.

## 4 Acceptance

The definition of the Level-1 trigger acceptance derives from the adopted schemes: for the Low-\(p_{T}\) trigger it is defined as the fraction of muon tracks which hit strips on at least 3 out of 4 read-out planes (in both \(\eta\) and \(\phi\) projections) in the inner two stations. For High-\(p_{T}\) trigger, it is defined has the fraction of tracks which, besides satisfying the Low-\(p_{T}\) trigger conditions, hit strips on at least 1 out of 2 planes in the outer station.

It must be stressed that the above definition of acceptance, based on hit strips, correctly takes into account only the sensitive areas of the trigger chambers and critically depends on the actual trajectories of the simulated muons. Therefore, in order to evaluate the trigger acceptance in the whole barrel, a huge amount (\(O(10^{8})\)) of single muons over a wide range of \(p_{T}\) has been tracked in the fully simulated detector.

The magnetic field affects the muon paths in a very complex way. In figure 8, the impact points on the pivot station of accepted \(p_{T}\) = 6. GeV \(\mu^{+}\) and \(\mu^{-}\) are plotted: besides the bending in \(\eta\), muons undergo focalizing/defocalizing effects in \(\phi\), which exhibit opposite characteristics at the two ends of the barrel. The behavior is symmetric for the two signs. The holes are due to the feet and the ribs; the increased coverage in \(\eta\) of the Large sectors is due to the "flap" chambers.

The net result of the layout and all the physics effects is illustrated in figure 9, which shows the distributions of the acceptance values as a function of \(\eta\) and \(\phi\) at the vertex for \(p_{T}\) = 6. GeV muons:

Figure 8: Impact points on the pivot station of accepted \(p_{T}\) = 6. GeV \(\mu^{+}\) and \(\mu^{-}\)

Figure 10: Acceptances respectively vs \(\eta\) and \(\phi\) at the vertex for \(p_{T}\) = 20. GeV \(\mu^{+}\) (shaded line) and \(\mu^{-}\) (black line). The differences on the distributions are due respectively to the toroidal and solenoidal components of the magnetic field.

shaded and black lines refer to \(\mu^{+}\) and \(\mu^{-}\). Because of the fall in acceptance near \(\eta=1.\), the \(\phi\) distribution is integrated over \(|\eta|<.9\).

The marked loss around 0 in the \(\eta\) distributions is due to the gap between the two half-barrels; less pronounced decreases correspond to the ribs of the coils. In \(\phi\), the two major losses are caused by the feet sectors, while the smaller ones are due to the ribs in the small sectors.

As expected, differences for opposite sign muons tend to disappear with increasing \(p_{T}\): in figure 10 the acceptance curves as a function of \(\eta\) and \(\phi\) at the vertex for \(p_{T}=20\). GeV muons of opposite signs are displayed. The \(\phi\) distribution is integrated over \(|\eta|<.95\).

The overall acceptance curves as a function of \(p_{T}\) for both Low-\(p_{T}\) and High-\(p_{T}\) trigger schemes are shown in figure 11. The difference at plateau is due to the decreased geometrical coverage of the trigger system when the outer station is added.

## 5 Trigger windows

As already mentioned in par. 2.2, the trigger logic aims at determining if a fired strip on the pivot station is confirmed by a suitable number of fired strips in the Low-\(p_{T}\) (and possibly High-\(p_{T}\)) coincidence planes close enough to the infinite momentum track through the pivot strip. By defining the size of the windows to be searched for confirming strips, it is possible to trigger with a certain

efficiency muons of \(p_{T}\) above a given threshold and, at the same time, to contain the number of fake triggers due to the various sources of background.

Because of the dependence of the muon trajectories on momentum, sign, \(\eta\) and \(\phi\), different window sizes have been evaluated for the different barrel regions and for all the desired \(p_{T}\) thresholds.

### Granularity of trigger windows

A trigger window will eventually be implemented as logical intersection of two orthogonal sets of strips in a coincidence matrix. The \(\eta\) and \(\phi\) ranges are determined separately by analyzing the spread of the distances between the strips hit by finite momentum muons on the coincidence planes and the infinite momentum tracks.

In the \(\phi\) projection the distance is limited to less than two strips on the Low-\(p_{T}\) station and less than three strips on the High-\(p_{T}\) station and the dependence on the muon parameters is very little. Because of that, actually the \(\phi\) coincidence is only used for rejecting background.

In the R-z projection, the distances largely vary with the muon parameters: in figure 12\(\Delta z\) on the Low- and High-\(p_{T}\) stations for respectively \(p_{T}\) = 6. and 20. GeV muons vs \(\eta\) is plotted, for Large, Small and Feet sectors.

Muons of opposite sign are bent in opposite directions with respect to the infinite momentum track: in particular, as already explained in par. 3.2, \(\mu^{-}\) are bent towards high z values and \(\mu^{+}\) towards low z values. Due to the implementation of the trigger logic (the pivot station between the other two) on the outer station positive \(\Delta z\) values mainly refer to \(\mu^{-}\) (apart from tail effects) and negative values to \(\mu^{+}\) figure 7; in the inner station the situation reverses.

The distance strongly depends on \(\eta\) and presents marked dissimilarities for the various sectors. In particular, the higher values of \(\Delta z\) for \(|\eta|>\)1. in the Large sectors are due to the "flap" chambers, which are positioned radially outward \(\sim\) 13. cm with respect to the other chambers.

The visible patterns in the plots derive from the fact that, in order to take into account the granularity of the readout (the pitch of the strips), the distance is computed as difference of two discrete quantities: the center of a strip on a coincidence plane and the impact point of a straight line (the infinite momentum track) that projects on that plane the center of a pivot strip. The modularity of the system tends to produce (here and there, according to the local characteristics of the chambers) cyclic behaviors.

Another characteristic of the plots is the symmetry with respect to the point (\(\Delta z=0.,\ \phi=0.\)), reflecting the symmetric behavior of opposite sign muons in the opposite halves of the barrel.

As a result of the \(\Delta z\) analysis, a granularity of \(\Delta\eta\sim 0.04\) has been found adequate for the trigger windows: the barrel has been accordingly divided in slices and the relative \(\Delta z\) values have been used to determine the respective window sizes.

### Size and asymmetry of the trigger windows

For each \(p_{T}\) threshold, a proper set of trigger windows for the \(\eta\) slices of the different sectors have been evaluated. From the \(\Delta z\) distributions of muons at threshold (figure 13), z intervals across the infinite momentum track (z=0.) large enough to include a given fraction of the entries are calculated. Because of the asymmetry, the positive and negative parts of the histograms (which refer to opposite sign muons) have to be processed separately to get the same fraction of \(\mu^{+}\) and \(\mu^{-}\).

The overall dependence of the trigger window on \(\eta\) in the Large, Small and Feet sectors is illustrated in figure 14: the sizes of the two halves of the windows have been selected requiring an acceptance of 90 % of muons at threshold (\(p_{T}\) = 6. Gev for Low-\(p_{T}\) and 20. GeV for High-\(p_{T}\) trigger).

The symmetry with respect to the point (\(\Delta z=0.,\ \phi=0.\)), that means symmetric values for opposite sign muons in the opposite halves of the barrel, indicates that the changes in size from one window to another are due to different conditions and not to poor statistics. In particular, besides the effects due to the calorimeter and to the magnetic field, the different lever arms for the overlapping chambers, and even more for "flap" chambers,

Trigger windows for Feet sectors have larger fluctuations with respect to the ones for Large and Small sectors because muon tracks crossing the feet supports undergo multiple scattering which spoils their vertex pointing.

The dependence of the window size on the required acceptance for muons at threshold can be seen in figure 15, where values for 90% and 95% are compared. The increase of 5% for the threshold acceptance leads to a constant increase of 10% for the trigger windows.

## 6 Trigger performances

The Level-1 trigger performances have been evaluated both in terms of selection efficiency and rejection power: single muon events over a wide \(p_{T}\) range and some interesting physics events have been tracked in the fully simulated detector and processed with the simulated trigger logic applying the predefined window sizes.

### Efficiency for single muons

Single muons have been used to estimate the sharpness of the threshold effect, i.e. the efficiency of the trigger system in selecting muons with \(p_{T}\) above threshold and rejecting the ones below.

The curves in figure 16 show the overall efficiency values for muons of different \(p_{T}\) in the range \(0.\div 70.\) GeV for 90% efficiency at threshold. All the nominal thresholds defined so far (6., 8. and 10. GeV for Low-\(p_{T}\) trigger, 20. and 40. GeV for High-\(p_{T}\) trigger) are considered.

Figure 16: Trigger efficiency curves for 90% efficiency at threshold. All the Low \(p_{T}\) (solid symbols) and High \(p_{T}\) (open symbols) thresholds are presented. Efficiencies at nominal thresholds for Low-\(p_{T}\) and High-\(p_{T}\) are also shown in logarithmic scale for low \(p_{T}\) values.

For the nominal thresholds (6. and 20. GeV) the efficiencies in the low \(p_{T}\) region are also presented in logarithmic scale.

It must be stressed that, because of the rapidly decreasing acceptance of Low- and High-\(p_{T}\) trigger for respectively \(|\eta|<.9\) and \(|\eta|<.95\), the efficiency values have been obtained integrating over these \(\eta\) ranges (as it was already done for the acceptance curves).

The efficiencies have also been evaluated for 95% efficiency at threshold: the comparison with the 90% efficiency values for 6. GeV threshold is shown in figure 17.

### Trigger rates due to muons from interaction products

The efficiency curves have been used to estimate the rates of events triggered with the different trigger thresholds.

The efficiency distributions as a function of \(p_{T}\) (for 90% efficiency at threshold) have been convolved with the inclusive muon cross-sections at LHC for prompt muons and muons from \(\pi/k\) decay in flight, quoted in [10] and [11] and plotted in figure 18 integrated in the region \(|\eta|<2.7\).

As expected, for the Low-\(p_{T}\) trigger meson decays in flight are the major rate source, with an increasing contribution from semileptonic decays of b and c hadrons: in Table 1 the estimated rates for a luminosity of \(10^{33}cm^{-2}s^{-1}\) are presented. Rates from top quarks and Z decays are negligible. The fraction of events originating from b hadrons grows from \(\sim 17\) to \(\sim 22\%\) as the threshold increases from 6. to 10. GeV. The rate due to the cavern background has been already estimated by the Level-1

For the High-\(p_{T}\) trigger a luminosity of \(10^{34}\,cm^{-2}\,s^{-1}\) is assumed and the rates for 20. GeV threshold are given.
