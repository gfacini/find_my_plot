**Boosted hadronic top identification at ATLAS for early 13 TeV data**

The ATLAS Collaboration

This note presents an algorithm to be used for the identification of boosted hadronically-decaying top quarks by the ATLAS collaboration for early 13  data. The algorithm relies on the jet invariant mass and N-subjettiness and can be used to identify such top quarks with transverse momentum above 200 GeV. The choice of these two variables is justified by a study of the performances of the combination of several substructure variables. The calibration of these variables and their associated uncertainties are presented. The performance of two efficiency working points is evaluated using simulated top-pair and QCD multijet samples. This performance is further tested in the top-pair-associated Higgs boson production environment.

## 1 Introduction

The high energy of proton collisions at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) leads to the production of top quarks with very high tranverse momentum, commonly referred to as _boosted_ top quarks. As the transverse momentum of a hadronically decaying top quark increases it becomes increasingly probable that its decay products will be fully contained within one jet. _Top-tagging_, the identification of such jets from boosted top quarks, has received considerable attention. This technique was used by ATLAS and CMS in LHC Run-1 analyses that searched for heavy particles decaying to top quarks [1; 2; 3; 4; 5; 6; 7; 8; 9]. In Run 2 a larger fraction of top-pair production (\(t\bar{t}\)) events is expected to produce boosted top quarks, thus top-tagging will be even more important. This note presents a simple top-tagging algorithm for use in early Run-2 analyses by the ATLAS collaboration. The presented algorithm is intended to have strong and reliable performance in different event topologies, for top-quark transverse momentum higher than 200 GeV. An algorithm using only two variables that are based on the jet's substructure has been chosen. The behaviour of such a tagger is easier to understand, via the behaviour of the chosen substructure variables, than that of more complex algorithms.

For the purposes of this note signal jets are considered to be jets originating from hadronically decaying top quarks. Simulated Standard Model (SM) \(t\bar{t}\) and \(Z^{\prime}\to t\bar{t}\) events are used as a source of such jets. Simulated QCD multijet production events are used as a source of background jets, which are considered to be any jets not originating from hadronically decaying top quarks.

This document is organized as follows. The ATLAS detector is described in Section 2. Details of the datasets that are used are given in Section 3. The reconstruction and calibration of the jets used for top-tagging, including their associated systematic uncertainties, are described in Section 4. The design and performance of the top-tagging algorithm is described in Section 5. The performance of the algorithm in the busier event topology characteristic of top-pair-associated Higgs boson production is discussed in Section 6.

## 2 ATLAS detector

The ATLAS detector [10] at the LHC covers nearly the entire solid angle around the collision point. It consists of an inner tracking detector surrounded by a thin superconducting solenoid, electromagnetic and hadronic calorimeters, and a muon spectrometer incorporating three large superconducting toroid magnets. The inner-detector system (ID) is immersed in a 2 T axial magnetic field and provides charged particle tracking in the pseudorapidity1 range \(|\eta|<2.5\).

Footnote 1: ATLAS uses a right-handed coordinate system with its origin at the nominal interaction point (IP) in the centre of the detector and the \(z\)-axis along the beam pipe. The \(x\)-axis points from the IP to the centre of the LHC ring, and the \(y\)-axis points upwards. Cylindrical coordinates \((r,\phi)\) are used in the transverse plane, \(\phi\) being the azimuthal angle around the \(z\)-axis. The pseudorapidity is defined in terms of the polar angle \(\theta\) as \(\eta=-\ln\tan(\theta/2)\). Angular distance is measured in units of \(\Delta R\equiv\sqrt{(\Delta\eta)^{2}+(\Delta\phi)^{2}}\).

The high-granularity silicon pixel detector covers the vertex region and typically provides three measurements per track, the first hit being normally in the innermost layer. It is followed by the silicon microstrip tracker which usually provides four measurements from eight strip layers. During the first LHC long shutdown, a new tracking layer, known as the Insertable B-Layer [11], was added close to the beam pipe.

The calorimeter system covers the pseudorapidity range \(|\eta|<4.9\). Within the region \(|\eta|<3.2\), electromagnetic calorimetry is provided by barrel and endcap high-granularity lead/liquid-argon (LAr) electromagnetic calorimeters, with an additional thin LAr presampler covering \(|\eta|<1.8\), to correct for energy loss in material upstream of the calorimeters. Hadronic calorimetry is provided by the steel/scintillating-tile calorimeter, segmented into three barrel structures within \(|\eta|<1.7\), and two copper/LAr hadronic endcap calorimeters. The solid angle coverage is completed with forward copper/LAr and tungsten/LAr calorimeter modules optimised for electromagnetic and hadronic measurements respectively.

A two-level trigger system [12] is used to select interesting events. The Level-1 trigger is implemented in hardware and uses a subset of detector information to reduce the event rate to a design value of at most 100 kHz. This is followed by a software-based trigger level which reduces the event rate to about 100 Hz.

## 3 Simulated data samples

Simulated high-mass \(Z^{\prime}\to t\bar{t}\) events are used as a source of signal jets (with several \(Z^{\prime}\) mass value: 1 \(\,\mathrm{\,Te\kern-1.0ptV}\), 1.75 \(\,\mathrm{\,Te\kern-1.0ptV}\), 2.5 \(\,\mathrm{\,Te\kern-1.0ptV}\) and 2.75 \(\,\mathrm{\,Te\kern-1.0ptV}\)). These \(Z^{\prime}\) events are generated using Pythia v8.168 [13] with the NNPDF2.3 LO PDF [14] set and A14 tune [15]. Decays of bottom and charm hadrons are performed via EvtGen (v1.2.0) [16]. Background jets are taken from SM QCD multijet production generated using Pythia v8.168 in the same configuration as used for the \(Z^{\prime}\to t\bar{t}\) events.

The MC samples are processed through the full ATLAS detector simulation [17] based on Geant 4[18]. Additional simulated proton-proton collisions generated using Pythia v8.160 with the A2M tune [19] and MSTW2008LO PDF set [20] are overlaid to simulate the effects of additional collisions from the same and nearby bunch crossings (pile-up), with a mean number of 22 collisions per bunch crossing [21]. All simulated events are then processed using the same reconstruction algorithms and analysis chain as would be used for real data.

In order to study the effect of uncertainties in the simulation of the ATLAS Run-2 detector configuration, samples with differing Geant parameters and detector conditions are used. The description of those variations and their relevance to reflect the uncertainties induced by the changes between Run 1 and Run 2 are detailed in Ref. [21]. Only a subset of all available variations are tested, the remaining variations were shown to be negligible in Ref. [22]. Those different configurations are:

_Noise Thr. Up/Down:_: While leaving the actual noise levels in the simulation unchanged, the noise thresholds (Thr.) used when finding three-dimensional clusters of energy deposited in the calorimeters (_topoclustering_) are varied. Those thresholds correspond to conditions where total calorimeter noise is increased/reduced by 10%-30%.

_50ns vs 25ns:_: The bunch spacing is changed from 25 ns to 50 ns.

_Run-1 Topo:_: The topoclustering procedure used in Run 1 is adopted in place of the new method2 used for the nominal samples.

Additional variations are considered for the high-\(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) range \(1300\GeV<p_{\mathrm{T}}<2000\GeV\) where uncertainties from Run-1 data suffer from poor statistical precision. These variations alter the simulation of intranuclear and low energy processes within the detector materials.

_QGSP_BIC:_ A quark gluon string model [23] with binary intranuclear cascade is used in this sample. This replaces the nominal choices of FrTof string model [24] and Bertini cascade [25]

_FTFP_BIC:_ The binary intranuclear cascade is used to treat the nuclear capture of negatively-charged particles and neutrons at rest.

_Rescat.:_ Re-scattering of the final state produced by FriTof is simulated with the binary intranuclear cascade.

_CHIPSxs:_ Nuclear capture of negative particles and neutrons at rest is treated using chiral invariant phase space (CHIPS). Different inelastic hadron-nucleus cross sections are used. Pions, protons and neutrons use the CHIPS cross section instead of that provided by Barashenkov-Glauber-Gribov.

_Low-E n:_ Uses a more accurate neutron capture process and inelastic neutron-nucleus cross section below 20 MeV.

_No Diffrac.:_ Projectile and target diffraction are disabled.

_New Elas.:_ Newer elastic cross sections and final-state models are used.

The topology dependence of the top-tagging performance is studied by comparing signal jets that are taken from Standard Model (SM) \(t\bar{t}\) production to top-pair-associated Higgs Boson (\(t\bar{t}H\)) production. The SM \(t\bar{t}\) events are simulated using the Powheg-Box [26, 27, 28, 29] generator, with CT10 NLO [30, 31] PDF set, interfaced to Pythia v6.4 [32] for showering and hadronisation. The Perugia 2012 tune [33] is used. The \(t\bar{t}H\) events are generated using Pythia v8.160 with CTEQ6L1 PDF set [34] and AU2 tune [35].

## 4 Jet reconstruction and calibration

Top-tagging of jets requires suitable inputs to jet reconstruction, choice of jet algorithm and grooming procedure, calibration methodology and choice of the top-tagging variables. These items are described in this section.

### Input to jet reconstruction

In this study, two types of inputs are given to jet reconstruction:

* Three-dimensional topological clusters (topo-clusters), calibrated with the LCW procedure (local cluster weighting) described in Section 4.3, are used to build fully reconstucted _calorimeter jets_. Calorimeter cells are first clustered together using a three-dimensional topological clustering algorithm that includes noise suppression [36]. The resulting topo-clusters are considered as massless four-momenta. They are classified as either electromagnetic or hadronic based on their shape, depth and energy density. In the LCW calibration procedure, corrections are applied to the energy in order to calibrate the clusters to the hadronic scale.

* Stable particles with a lifetime of at least 10 ps (excluding muons and neutrinos) are used in simulated samples to build _generator-level jets_. These particles retain their respective masses when input to the jet reconstruction algorithm.

Inputs associated with a particular jet are referred to as jet _constituents_.

### Jet algorithm and grooming

Jets are built from the inputs according to the anti-\(k_{t}\) algorithm [37] as implemented within FastJet[38]. The radius parameter, \(R\), is set to 1.0, and the four-momentum recombination scheme is used. Jets are further _trimmed_[39], which has been shown to mitigate the effects of pile-up [40]. In trimming the constituents of a jet are reclustered into subjets according to the \(k_{t}\) algorithm [41, 42, 43] with radius parameter \(R_{\rm sub}\). Subjets with a transverse momentum smaller than a fraction \(f_{\rm cut}\) of the parent jet transverse momentum are then discarded. The surviving subjets are recombined to produce the final trimmed jet. Based on pile-up sensitivity study, the trimming parameters used are \(R_{\rm sub}=0.2\) and \(f_{\rm cut}=0.05\).

In order to ensure that the substructure variables are meaningful, only the jets with more than two constituents are considered.

### Calibration methodology

The jet calibration is performed on calorimeter jets following the procedures described in Ref. [44], and adapted to the use case of large radius jets in Ref. [40].

The hadronic calibration scheme starts from the measured calorimeter energy at the electromagnetic (EM) energy scale [45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53], which correctly measures the energy deposited by EM showers. A local cluster weighting (LCW) calibration method classifies topological clusters along a continuous scale as being electromagnetic or hadronic, using shower shapes and energy densities. Energy corrections are applied to hadronic clusters based on this classification scheme, which is derived from single-pion MC simulations and has been tested using test beams. These corrections account for the effects of non-compensation, signal losses due to noise suppression and out-of-cluster effects in building topo-clusters, and energy lost in non-instrumented regions of the calorimeters. The results shown here use LCW clusters as input to the jet algorithm.

The final jet energy scale (JES) calibration is derived as a correction relating the calorimeter's response to the true jet energy. More details regarding the evaluation and validation of this approach can be found in Ref. [44]. The JES correction used here for large-\(R\) jets is derived from a Pythia MC sample including pile-up events. Since the trimming procedure reduces pile-up dependence of relevant kinematic quantities significantly, there is no explicit jet offset correction for pile-up contributions, as in the standard JES procedure [44].

Since one of the primary goals of the use of large-\(R\) and groomed jet algorithms is to reconstruct the masses of jets accurately, a last step is added to the calibration procedure of large-\(R\) jets wherein the mass of the jet (as defined in Section 4.4) is calibrated based on the MC simulation of dijet events. An explicit jet mass calibration is important when using the individual invariant jet mass, since the mass is particularly susceptible to soft, wide-angle contributions that do not otherwise significantly impact the jet energy scale. The procedure measures the jet mass response for jets built from LCW clusters after the standard JES calibration. The mass response is determined from the mean of a Gaussian fit to the core of the distribution of the reconstructed jet mass divided by the corresponding generator-level jet mass. A more complete description of the mass calibration procedure is available in Refs. [21, 22].

### Variables used in top-tagging

Two substructure-related variables are used in the presented simple top-tagging algorithm:

* The **calibrated jet mass \(\boldsymbol{m_{\mathrm{jet}}^{\mathrm{calib}}}\)**. The jet mass corresponds to the invariant mass calculated from the four-momenta of its constituents. The mass, \(m_{\mathrm{jet}}^{\mathrm{uncalib}}\), is defined by: \[(m_{\mathrm{jet}}^{\mathrm{uncalib}})^{2}=\left(\sum_{i}E_{i}\right)^{2}- \left(\sum_{i}\vec{p}_{i}\right)^{2},\] (1) where \(E_{i}\) and \(\vec{p}_{i}\) are the energy and the three-momentum of the \(i^{\mathrm{th}}\) jet constituent. The jet mass is then calibrated as described in Section 4.3.
* The **N-subjettiness ratio \(\boldsymbol{\tau_{32}}\)**. The N-subjettiness variable \(\tau_{N}\)[54, 55] is based on the reconstruction of exactly \(N\) subjets with the \(k_{t}\) jet algorithm from the constituents of the jet. Once those \(N\) subjets are reconstructed, the \(\tau_{N}\) variable is defined by: \[\tau_{N}=\frac{1}{d_{0}}\sum_{k}p_{\mathrm{T}k}\times\min(\delta R_{1k}, \delta R_{2k},\ldots,\delta R_{NK}),\] (2) with \(d_{0}=\sum\limits_{k}p_{\mathrm{T}k}\times R\), where \(R\) is the radius parameter of the jet, \(p_{\mathrm{T}k}\) is the transverse momentum of the constituent \(k\), and \(\delta R_{ik}\) is the distance between the subjets \(i\) and the constituent \(k\). The N-subjettiness ratio \(\tau_{32}\) is then defined as \(\tau_{32}=\tau_{3}/\tau_{2}\). In order to obtain an observable independent of the recoil of soft radiation inside the jet, the subjets are reconstructed with a winner-take-all (WTA) recombination scheme [56]: during the \(k_{t}\) reconstruction algorithm, each subjet formed from two subjets 1 and 2 is defined to be the massless four-vector of energy \(E_{r}=E_{1}+E_{2}\) and of three-momentum \(\vec{p}_{r}=E_{r}\hat{n}_{r}\), where \(\hat{n}_{r}\) is the unit-normalized three-momentum of the highest transverse momentum protojet. The N-subjettiness variable \(\tau_{N}\) expresses how well a jet can be described as containing N or fewer subjets. The ratio \(\tau_{32}\) allows discrimination between jets containing a three-prong structure and jets containing a two-prong structure.

The distributions of \(m_{\mathrm{jet}}^{\mathrm{calib}}\) and of \(\tau_{32}\), in bins of \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\), are shown in Fig. 1. For signal in the transverse momentum range \(200\,\mathrm{GeV}<p_{\mathrm{T}}<500\,\mathrm{GeV}\) a large fraction of top quarks are not fully contained3 and thus a \(W\)-boson mass peak is visible at around \(80\,\mathrm{GeV}\) in addition to a broad top-quark peak at around \(175\,\mathrm{GeV}\) with a large tail to lower masses. As the transverse momentum increases, so does the fraction of jets with fully contained top-quarks, so the top-quark mass peak becomes clearer and narrower, while the \(W\)-boson peak diminishes. For background, the shape is dominated by a Sudakov peak which gradually shifts to higher mass as the jet \(p_{T}\) increases. For the \(1000\,\mathrm{GeV}<p_{\mathrm{T}}<1500\,\mathrm{GeV}\) range this Sudakov peak occurs closer to the \(W\)-boson mass. For \(\tau_{32}\) the background exhibits a broad peak at 0.7 with a large tail extending to lower values. The signal peaks at similar values but has a larger tail to lower values.

## 5 Top-tagging performance

In this section, the top-tagging algorithm is described, including the justification of the choice of the tagging variables. Furthermore, the systematic uncertainties on the tagging variables are studied and the signal efficiency and background rejection, for different working points, are shown with respect to the jet \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\).

### Algorithm design

The top-tagging algorithm uses the two variables \(m_{\mathrm{jet}}^{\mathrm{calib}}\) and \(\tau_{32}\). Requirements are placed on these variables to produce the best background rejection for a given signal efficiency as defined in Section. 5.2. Two working points are provided: 50% signal efficiency, for analyses with very large reducible background (i.e. processes that do not include hadronically decaying top quarks), and 80% signal efficiency, for analyses dominated by signal and/or irreducible background (i.e. processes containing hadronically decaying top quarks). Optimisation was performed by testing all possible upper thresholds on \(\tau_{32}\) and lower thresholds on \(m_{\mathrm{jet}}^{\mathrm{calib}}\) in bins of jet \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\), followed by a regularised interpolation between the points to obtain the requirements at a given \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\). The requirements placed on \(m_{\mathrm{jet}}^{\mathrm{calib}}\) and \(\tau_{32}\) are shown in Fig. 2. For the 50% (80%) working point the upper allowed value of \(\tau_{32}\) varies from 0.75 (0.85) at \(p_{\mathrm{T}}=200\,\mathrm{GeV}\) to 0.57 (0.7) for \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\geq 1600\,\mathrm{GeV}\). The lower threshold on \(m_{\mathrm{jet}}^{\mathrm{calib}}\) varies from 85\(\,\mathrm{GeV}\) (70\(\,\mathrm{GeV}\)) at \(p_{\mathrm{T}}=200\,\mathrm{GeV}\) to 140\(\,\mathrm{GeV}\) (135\(\,\mathrm{GeV}\)) for \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\geq 1600\,\mathrm{GeV}\).

The two variables \(m_{\mathrm{jet}}^{\mathrm{calib}}\) and \(\tau_{32}\) were chosen from a set of substructure variables, including other N-subjettiness ratios (\(\tau_{21}\)), splitting scale variables (\(\sqrt{d_{12}}\), \(\sqrt{d_{23}}\)) and the minimum dijet mass from the three subjets (\(Q_{w}\)) [57]. The two chosen variables show a good background rejection at 50% and 80% signal efficiency (as defined in Section. 5.2), as shown in Fig. 3. Because high \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) jets are more correlated, some substructure variables have differing performances in the low and high \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) regions. The correlation between pairs of variables is given in Fig. 4, it can be seen that the \(\tau_{ij}\) variables are uncorrelated with respect to the mass and energy scale variables. The choice of tagging variables is motivated by their lack of correlated behaviour, the strong performance of this combination and its robustness across the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) range under study.

### Algorithm performance

The performance of the top-tagging algorithm is quantified by studying the efficiency for tagging jets that contain the decay products of top quarks and for rejecting other jets. The signal efficiency is defined as the fraction of reconstructed jets in a mixture of simulated \(Z^{\prime}\to t\bar{t}\) samples, matching a generator-level jet, that pass the top-tagging algorithm. It has been checked that the efficiencies in a SM \(t\bar{t}\) sample are identical within statistical uncertainties. The background rejection is the reciprocal of the fraction of jets from the simulated QCD dijet sample, matching a generator-level jet, that pass the top-tagging algorithm.

Figure 1: The distribution of \(m_{\rm jet}^{\rm calib}\) and \(\tau_{32}\) for signal and QCD dijet events in bins of \(p_{\rm T}\). The mass distribution is shown for (a) 250 GeV\(<p_{\rm T}<\) 500 GeV, (c) 500 GeV\(<p_{\rm T}<\) 1000 GeV, and (e) 1000 GeV\(<p_{\rm T}<\) 1500 GeV. The \(\tau_{32}\) distribution is shown for (b) 250 GeV\(<p_{\rm T}<\) 500 GeV, (d) 500 GeV\(<p_{\rm T}<\) 1000 GeV, and (f) 1000 GeV\(<p_{\rm T}<\) 1500 GeV. The \(m_{\rm jet}^{\rm calib}\) distributions are obtained for jets with \(\tau_{32}<0.7\), and the \(\tau_{32}\) distributions are obtained for jets with \(m_{\rm jet}^{\rm calib}>\) 80 GeV. The signal is obtained from \(Z^{\prime}\to t\bar{t}\) events, for calorimeter jets matched with a generator-level jet (\(\Delta R<0.75\)) itself matched with the generator-level hadronically decaying top-quark (\(\Delta R<0.75\)). The background is obtained from SM QCD multijet calorimeter jets.

Figure 3: Background rejection obtained for two signal efficiency points (50% and 80%), for two \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) regions. The statistical uncertainties are around 1 unit of background rejection.

Figure 2: Values of the selection requirements in the top-tagging algorithm: (a) the lower threshold on \(m_{\mathrm{jet}}^{\mathrm{calib}}\) for the 50% working point; (b) the lower threshold on \(m_{\mathrm{jet}}^{\mathrm{calib}}\) for the 80% working point; (c) the upper threshold on \(\tau_{32}\) for the 50% working point and (d) the upper threshold on \(\tau_{32}\) for the 80% working point. The black points show the explicitly evaluated requirements, the red line shows the regularised interpolation.

The jet matching criterion is that the reconstructed jet lies within \(\Delta R<0.75\) of the generator-level jet. Futhermore, signal generator-level jets must have transverse momentum greater than \(200\,\mathrm{G}\mathrm{e}\mathrm{V}\) and lie within \(\Delta R<0.75\) of a hadronically decaying top quark. The signal efficiency and background rejection are shown in Fig. 5. The uncertainty bands correspond to the propagation of the substructure variables uncertainties that are described in Section. 5.3. The 50% efficiency working point has a flat efficiency for \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) above \(400\,\mathrm{G}\mathrm{e}\mathrm{V}\), where the majority of top-quarks are fully contained within the jet. The efficiency rises in the \(200\,\mathrm{G}\mathrm{e}\mathrm{V}<p_{\mathrm{T}}<400\,\mathrm{G}\mathrm{e} \mathrm{V}\) region as the fraction of fully contained tops increases. The looser 80% working point already achieves a flat efficiency above \(250\,\mathrm{G}\mathrm{e}\mathrm{V}\), making it a suitable choice for searches that wish to avoid shaping the top \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) spectrum. The 50% (80%) working point reduces the background by at least a factor of 6 (2) across the full \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) range. For both working points, rejection deteriorates at high \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) as the background mass peak shifts towards higher values. The non-flat behavior at low \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\), in particular the first bin in Fig. 4(a), is due to the regularised cut values deviating from the explicitly evaluated cut values, as visible in Fig. 2. The \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\), \(m_{\mathrm{jet}}^{\mathrm{calib}}\) and \(\tau_{32}\) uncertainties, as derived in Section. 5.3, are propagated to get the uncertainties on the efficiency. The uncertainties on the three variables are considered 100% correlated. The Run-1 uncertainty is the dominant component for each variable. The efficiency uncertainty is dominated by the effect of the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) and \(m_{\mathrm{jet}}^{\mathrm{calib}}\) uncertainties at low and high \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) (\(p_{\mathrm{T}}<300\mathrm{G}\mathrm{e}\mathrm{V}\mathrm{a}\mathrm{d}\mathrm{e} \mathrm{V}\)), while at moderate \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\), the contributions from the three variables are similar.

### Systematic uncertainties

The systematic uncertainties on the \(m_{\mathrm{jet}}^{\mathrm{calib}}\), \(\tau_{32}\) and \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) variables for trimmed large-\(R\) jets (jets reconstructed as defined in Sec. 4.2) are derived from a baseline Run-1 in-situ uncertainty complemented by additional Run-2 MC uncertainties. The baseline uncertainty is based on the previous knowledge of those variables during the first period of data taking, and uses the track-jet double-ratio method described in Ref. [40].

As studied in Ref. [58], the baseline uncertainties are derived from approximately \(20\,\mathrm{f}\mathrm{b}^{-1}\) of \(\sqrt{s}=8\,\mathrm{T}\mathrm{e}\mathrm{V}\) Run-1 data. The preselection requires \(m>70\,\mathrm{G}\mathrm{e}\mathrm{V}\), in order to select a more signal-like region, except in the case of the mass, where no preselection is applied. The uncertainties are defined in one \(|\eta|\) bin, \(0<|\eta|<2.0\), and up to \(p_{\mathrm{T}}=1000\,\mathrm{G}\mathrm{e}\mathrm{V}\). The uncertainties on \(m_{\mathrm{jet}}^{\mathrm{calib}}\), \(\tau_{32}\) and \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) from this method

Figure 4: Correlation matrices for the different studied variables, for signal (left) and background (right) events.

Figure 5: Efficiency and rejection of the top-tagging algorithm versus jet transverse momentum \(p_{\rm T}\) for simulated \(Z^{\prime}\to t\bar{t}\) events and for simulated QCD dijet production: (a) 50% efficiency working point and (b) 80% efficiency working point. The uncertainties (shaded area) are obtained from the propagation of the \(p_{\rm T}\), \(m_{\rm jet}^{\rm calib}\) and \(\tau_{32}\) uncertainties as derived in Section. 5.3, considered 100% correlated.

with respect to the reconstructed jet \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) are given in Fig. 6. The \(\tau_{32}\) and \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) uncertainties are around 4% independent of jet \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) and \(m/p_{\mathrm{T}}\). The \(m_{\mathrm{jet}}^{\mathrm{calib}}\) uncertainties are approximately 4% at the lowest \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) rising to 4.5% (6%) for high (low) values of \(m/p_{\mathrm{T}}\).

The additional uncertainties are derived from Run-2 MC simulation. For a given variable, the jet response is defined as the ratio between the variables from the calorimeter jets and the geometrically matched generator-level jets (\(\Delta R<0.75\)). Those responses are calculated for different ranges in jet \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\). The mean of the Gaussian fit is extracted, and the ratio between the nominal sample and the variation sample is used as an estimate of the systematic uncertainties for this variation. Due to large statistical uncertainties for high \(m/p_{\mathrm{T}}\), a smoothing procedure is applied: using the two dimensional distributions of the response versus \(m/p_{\mathrm{T}}\), a kernel smoothing algorithm is performed based on \(3\times 3\) cells. Uncertainties from those variations are given in Fig. 7 and Fig. 8, for the mass, the \(\tau_{32}\) and the transverse momentum. For low values of \(m/p_{\mathrm{T}}\), those uncertainties are usually lower than 3%, with larger values for larger \(m/p_{\mathrm{T}}\) up to around 5%. Comparing \(\tau_{32}\) and \(m_{\mathrm{jet}}^{\mathrm{calib}}\), the \(\tau_{32}\) uncertainties tend to be slightly smaller than \(m_{\mathrm{jet}}^{\mathrm{calib}}\) uncertainties.

The final total uncertainties are obtained by the sum in quadrature of the relevant components. For \(p_{\mathrm{T}}<500\mathrm{GeV}\), these components are the Run-1 uncertainties and the _Noise Thr. Up/Down_ and _50ns vs 25ns_ variations. For \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>500\mathrm{GeV}\), these components are the extended Run-1 uncertainties for high \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) and the _QGSP_BIC_, _Noise Thr. Up/Down_, _50ns vs 25ns_, _FTFP_BIC_ and _Rescat._ variations.

## 6 Application in top-pair-associated Higgs boson production

The performance of the proposed top-tagging algorithm has been tested for top-pair-associated Higgs boson production in the boosted-top regime (\(t\bar{t}H\)). With respect to \(Z^{\prime}\to t\bar{t}\) or SM \(t\bar{t}\) processes that are described in the preceding sections of this note, the \(t\bar{t}H\) process leads to a particularly busy final state, the final particles being: one charged lepton, one neutrino, four \(b\) quarks and two additional quarks. The presence of the Higgs boson decay products can affect the reconstruction of the large-\(R\) jet corresponding to the top-quark decay, resulting in a large-\(R\) jet containing a mixture of contributions from the hadronically decaying top and from the Higgs boson. This has an impact on the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) and the substructure variables. This study checks whether this impact reduces the efficiency of the proposed top-tagging algorithm to identify reconstructed large-\(R\) jets induced by hadronically decaying top quarks.

In order to evaluate the consistency in \(t\bar{t}H\) events with the results of the previous sections, the responses for the mass and the \(\tau_{32}\) variables (as defined in Section 5.3) were generated for \(t\bar{t}H\) and \(t\bar{t}\) events, and the ratios of the fitted means of those responses are given in Fig. 9. The mass response is similar in \(t\bar{t}H\) and \(t\bar{t}\). For the \(\tau_{32}\) response, discrepancies are observed for low \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) due to the dependence of the \(\tau_{32}\) response on the jet mass and \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) distributions within the samples.

The top-tagging efficiencies, using a generator-level-matching identical to that used for \(t\bar{t}\), was also produced for \(t\bar{t}H\) events, and the ratio of those efficiencies with respect to the ones from \(t\bar{t}\) events is given in Fig. 10, for the two working points. Both \(t\bar{t}H\) efficiency working points are higher for the low \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) region, and become consistent with the performance in \(t\bar{t}\) events for higher \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\). This increase in efficiency is also present when generator-level jet \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) is used, and is more visible in jets matched with top quark for which the Higgs boson is geometrically close. The large-\(R\) jet selection performed by the top-tagging algorithm favours higher mass and characteristics of a more multi-prong substructure. The contamination from the Higgs boson decay on the large-\(R\) jets in \(t\bar{t}H\) shifts jets in the favoured directions for these variables,and therefore leads to an increase in the tagging efficiency. This shows that the capacity of the proposed top-tagger to identify a large-\(R\) jet induced by hadronically decaying top quark is not diminished when the reconstructed large-\(R\) is contaminated by other decay products in a busy environment.

## 7 Conclusion

A top-tagging algorithm based on the jet substructure variables \(m_{\mathrm{jet}}^{\mathrm{calib}}\) and \(\tau_{32}\) has been presented. The performance has been evaluated using simulated signal and background jets. Working points at 50% and 80% top-tagging efficiency are available for use in analyses by the ATLAS collaboration. The uncertainties on the top tagging efficiency, derived using in situ techniques with Run-1 data at low transverse-momentum and additional simulated data at high transverse momentum, are between 1% and 10% depending on the top-quark transverse-momentum. Furthermore, the efficiency has also been evaluated in the busier \(ttH\) event topology.

Figure 7: The uncertainties for \(m_{\rm jet}^{\rm calib}\) (a,b), \(\tau_{32}\) (c,d) and \(p_{\rm T}\) (e,f), using _Noise Thr. Up/Down_ and _50ns vs 25ns_ variations as defined in Section 3. Those uncertainties are evaluated for \(250\,\mbox{GeV}\!\!<p_{\rm T}<500\,\mbox{GeV}\)(left) and \(p_{\rm T}>500\,\mbox{GeV}\)(right). The uncertainty on \(\tau_{32}\) is obtained for jets with \(m_{\rm jet}^{\rm calib}>70\,\mbox{GeV}\). In order to avoid artificially large values due to low statistics in the two last bins of the _Noise Thr. Up/Down_ variations for the \(\tau_{32}\) variable, those bins have been computed using \(t\bar{t}\) sample.

Figure 8: The uncertainties for \(m_{\rm jet}^{\rm calib}\) (a), \(\tau_{32}\) (b) and \(p_{\rm T}\) (c),using _FTFP_BIC_ and _Rescat._ variations as defined in Section 3. Those uncertainties are evaluated for \(p_{\rm T}>500\) GeV. The uncertainty on \(\tau_{32}\) is obtained for jets with \(m_{\rm jet}^{\rm calib}>70\) GeV.
