Projections for measurements of Higgs boson cross sections, branching ratios, coupling parameters and mass with the ATLAS detector at the HL-LHC

The ATLAS Collaboration

###### Abstract

A study is presented on the ATLAS experimental prospects for measuring Higgs boson cross sections, signal strengths and branching ratios, and determining couplings to individual fermions and bosons, at the High Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC) with 3000 fb\({}^{-1}\)collected at 14 TeV. The results shown here are extrapolated from the Run 2 results using datasets of 36 fb\({}^{-1}\) and 80 fb\({}^{-1}\) collected at 13 TeV. The different analyses are combined to compute the expected precision of the measurement of the cross-sections for the main production processes of the Higgs boson and of the branching ratios into its main decay modes as well as their interpretation in terms of modifiers to Higgs boson couplings. It is assumed that the upgraded detector produces the same physics capabilities at HL-LHC as were achieved for Run 2, despite the increased pileup. The one exception for some of the measurements is muons, where an improved momentum resolution is anticipated. The baseline scenario for the expected systematic uncertainties assumes a reduction of many uncertainties compared to the extrapolated analyses. As a conservative benchmark, the results with Run 2 systematic uncertainty values are given as well. A similar exercise is also done for the Higgs boson mass measurement expected at HL-LHC.

## 1 Introduction

One of the main motivations for the planned high-luminosity upgrade of the LHC (HL-LHC), is to enable precise measurements of Higgs boson properties. In the Standard Model (SM), all properties of the Higgs boson are defined once its mass is known. However, this model leaves many open questions such as the hierarchy problem and the nature of dark matter. Many alternative theories addressing these issues make different predictions for the properties of one or more Higgs bosons. Precise measurements in the Higgs sector are therefore a high priority in the future programme of particle physics.

A comprehensive study of the projected precision of measurements of the Higgs boson production cross section times branching ratios and Higgs boson couplings was presented by the ATLAS Collaboration in 2014 [1]. It was based on the extrapolation of the Run 1 results to the 3000 fb\({}^{-1}\) integrated luminosity expected at HL-LHC.

The aim of this note is to update the expected measurement precision at HL-LHC of the above measurements taking advantage of the analysis improvements developed for Run 2 analyses. An extrapolation from the data samples collected in 2015 and 2016, the two first years of the LHC programme, corresponding to 36 fb\({}^{-1}\), was performed. This was implemented for the \(WW\), \(Z\gamma\), \(t\bar{t}H\) and \(\tau\tau\) final states. The extrapolation for the remaining channels (\(\gamma\gamma\), \(ZZ\), \(VH\) with \(H\to b\bar{b}\) and \(\mu\mu\)) used the latest results based on the data samples collected in 2015, 2016 and 2017 (80 fb\({}^{-1}\)).

In addition to the increase in integrated luminosity, this extrapolation accounts for the increase in total cross sections from 13 to 14 TeV. The signal yields have been scaled by the ratio of Higgs boson production cross sections values at 13 and 14 TeV, reported in Ref. [2]. The background yields have been scaled according to the parton luminosity ratio between 13 and 14 TeV, reported in Ref. [3], taking into account whether the background process is predominantly quark pair or gluon pair initiated.

To simplify the extrapolation, object reconstruction efficiencies, resolutions and fake rates are assumed to be similar in the Run 2 and HL-LHC environments. This is based on the assumption that the improved performance of the ATLAS detector at HL-LHC will compensate for the degradation induced by higher pile up. The extrapolated measurement precision from Run 2 to HL-LHC integrated luminosity has been obtained by means of a likelihood fit to an Asimov data set based on the Run 2 model with the corrections described above applied.

Systematic uncertainties are separated into components for experimental uncertainties and theory uncertainties on signal and background processes. Their values in the baseline scenario considered for the HL-LHC (scenario S2) are reduced compared to those currently used in Run 2, reflecting the situation that is expected to be reached at the end of the HL-LHC programme. The correction factors, discussed with CMS and the theory community, are reported in Ref. [4]. By default, in scenario S2, all theory uncertainties for signal and background are halved. Exceptions are the PDF uncertainties for which reduction factors depend on the quark/gluon initial states and on energy scale values [5], and the uncertainties on the \(t\bar{t}\)+heavy flavour cross section, as explained in Section 2.6.

The uncertainty on the integrated luminosity is set to 1%. The uncertainties due to the limited size of simulation samples are assumed to be negligible. In the relevant analyses, the uncertainty on the modeling of the continuum background using a functional form description is also assumed to become negligible. To demonstrate the importance of the reduction of the systematic uncertainties in the HL-LHC era compared to Run 2, expected measurement uncertainties are provided for a scenario in which systematic uncertainties are kept at their current Run 2 values (called scenario S1). The exceptions are the uncertainties due tothe size of simulation samples and the uncertainty on the modeling of the continuum background using a functional form description, which are assumed to be negligible, not only in the scenario S2, but also in scenario S1.

It should be noted that for this note, the breakdown of systematic uncertainties has been done in a sequential way, first separating the theory background uncertainties first from the total uncertainty, then theory signal uncertainties and finally the experimental uncertainties. In case of correlations between the experimental and theoretical uncertainty components, the quoted experimental and theory uncertainties in scenario S1 might differ significantly from those quoted in the corresponding Run 2 papers and conference notes, if a different procedure has been used there. In these cases, the different procedure will be highlighted in the relevant sections. Expected precision both of the measured signal strength \(\mu\), defined as the ratio of the total Higgs boson signal yield to its SM prediction, and of the measured cross sections is reported for most channels.

All the extrapolated single-channel results are combined to compute the cross sections per production mode and the branching ratios. The measured production modes are gluon-gluon fusion (ggF), vector-boson fusion (VBF), Higgs boson production in association with a vector boson ( \(VH\): sum of \(WH\), \(q\bar{q}\to ZH\), and \(gg\to ZH\) processes), and Higgs boson production in association with a top-antitop quark pair (\(t\bar{t}H\)) or a single top quark (\(tH\)). The measured decays modes are the decays of the Higgs boson to \(\gamma\gamma\), \(ZZ\), \(WW\), \(\tau\tau\), \(bb\), \(\mu\mu\) and \(Z\gamma\). These results are interpreted in a framework of multiplicative modifiers \(\kappa\) applied to the SM values of Higgs boson couplings [3] and as limits on Beyond Standard Model (BSM) effects.

The last section of the note addresses the expected precision of the Higgs boson mass measurement at HL-LHC based on the \(H\to ZZ^{*}\to 4\ell\) channel, which is the least sensitive to systematic uncertainties.

## 2 Single channels

### \(H\to\gamma\gamma\)

The measurement of Higgs boson properties in the diphoton decay channel, using a dataset with an integrated luminosity of 80 fb\({}^{-1}\) from Run 2, has been recently released in Ref. [6]. The cross sections have been measured for several production modes of the Higgs boson: ggF, VBF, \(VH\) and \(t\bar{t}H+tH\) later labelled as 'top'.

Higgs boson production in association with a bottom-antibottom quark pair (\(b\bar{b}H\)) is merged with the ggF production mode. Simplified template cross sections (STXS) in the so-called strong merging scheme of Stage-1 have been measured as well. The analysis uses 29 event categories, that are optimised to be as pure as possible in STXS regions.

The signal in each category is parametrised using a double-sided Crystal Ball [7] function, whose parameters are fixed from a fit to the MC distributions. Its mean and width are allowed to vary within the systematic uncertainties on the photon energy scale (PES) and within the systematic uncertainties on the photon energy resolution (PER), respectively.

The background estimation uses fully data-driven techniques; an analytic function was chosen in each category to provide an accurate descriptions of the \(m_{\gamma\gamma}\) shape in simulated background samples. This is the main source of systematic uncertainty, as described in Ref. [6] and labelled as'spurious signal', and is often dominated by the uncertainty related to the limited size of the simulated samples. Since this latter uncertainty is assumed to be negligible at HL-LHC and moreover an improved modeling strategy of the \(m_{\gamma\gamma}\) shape is expected, the spurious signal uncertainty is neglected in this extrapolation.

The other important systematic uncertainties are QCD scale uncertainties causing event migrations between categories, photon isolation efficiencies and jet energy uncertainties.

The luminosity and the signal cross sections have been scaled as described in Section 1. Due to the data-driven background estimation, no accurate studies have been performed on the exact background composition in each category. The relative fractions of each component are scaled within their uncertainties, but this is shown to have a negligible impact on the fitted event yield.

In the Run 2 analysis, a conservative uncertainty of 100% on the Higgs boson production in association with heavy flavour jets for the resonant background in \(t\bar{t}H\) categories is used. Future measurements of the heavy flavour content of jets produced in association with the Higgs boson are expected to constrain these values. For scenario S2, the above uncertainty related to heavy flavour quark production modeling has been divided by two. In scenario S2, the photon isolation efficiency and the jet flavour composition uncertainties become the biggest source of systematics.

The results for the extrapolation of the production cross-section measurements times \(H\to\gamma\gamma\) branching ratio at HL-LHC for scenario S2 and for Higgs-boson absolute rapidity \(|y_{H}|<2.5\) are :

\[\sigma_{\rm ggF+b\bar{b}H}\times{\rm B}(H\to\gamma\gamma)=114.3^{+4.2 }_{-4.0}\,{\rm fb}=114.3^{+2.0}_{-2.0}\,{\rm(stat)}\,^{+3.6}_{-3.4}\,{\rm(exp)} \,^{+0.7}_{-0.7}\,{\rm(sig)}\,{\rm fb}\] \[\sigma_{\rm VBF}\times{\rm B}(H\to\gamma\gamma)=9.03^{+0.86}_{-0.8 0}\,{\rm fb}=9.03^{+0.40}_{-0.39}\,{\rm(stat)}\,^{+0.57}_{-0.50}\,{\rm(exp)}\,^{ +0.52}_{-0.48}\,{\rm(sig)}\,{\rm fb}\] \[\sigma_{\rm VH}\times{\rm B}(H\to\gamma\gamma)=5.01^{+0.47}_{-0.45 }\,{\rm fb}=5.01^{+0.40}_{-0.40}\,{\rm(stat)}\,^{+0.19}_{-0.17}\,{\rm(exp)}\,^{ +0.15}_{-0.14}\,{\rm(sig)}\,{\rm fb}\] \[\sigma_{\rm top}\times{\rm B}(H\to\gamma\gamma)=1.61^{+0.13}_{-0.12 }\,{\rm fb}=1.61^{+0.08}_{-0.07}\,{\rm(stat)}\,^{+0.08}_{-0.07}\,{\rm(exp)}\,^{ +0.07}_{-0.06}\,{\rm(sig)}\,{\rm fb}\]

These results are compared to the SM prediction in Figure 1; the SM uncertainties on cross sections and branching ratio are divided by two compared to their current values, which approximately corresponds to the scaling expected for scenario S2. Table 1 shows the relative uncertainties on the cross-section measurements with Run 2 data and their expected values at HL-LHC with both systematic uncertainty scenarios. The last column displays the expected impact of signal theory uncertainties on the measured signal strength (\(\Delta\mu_{\rm sig}\)). For the cross-section measurements, only signal theory uncertainties on the fiducial acceptance are considered, while for the signal strength measurements, in addition, also the uncertainty on the predicted SM production-mode cross sections times \(H\to\gamma\gamma\) branching ratio is taken into account.

The expected ranking of the 10 systematic uncertainties for scenario S2 with the largest impact on the measured production-mode cross sections times \(H\to\gamma\gamma\) branching ratio and on the measured production-mode signal strengths can be seen in Figures 2-3, respectively.

Uncertainties are reported relative to the SM cross section at the corresponding center-of-mass energy. Both scenarios S1 and S2 have been considered for the systematic uncertainties in the HL-LHC extrapolation. The spurious signal uncertainty is removed in both cases. The last column shows the signal theory uncertainty component when the measurement parameters are production-mode signal strengths instead of cross sections.

### \(H\to ZZ^{*}\)

Using a dataset with an integrated luminosity of 80 fb\({}^{-1}\) at Run 2, the measurement of the Higgs boson production cross section in the \(H\to ZZ^{*}\to 4\ell\) decay channel [8] has been performed within the framework of the simplified template cross sections [2]. For the results in this note, the Stage 0 - Simplified Template Cross Sections framework (STXS Stage 0) has been used and the four main production modes are considered: ggF, VBF, \(VH\) and \(t\bar{t}H\).

In the Run 2 analysis [8], for the Stage-0 ggF bin, the dominant systematic uncertainties on the cross-section measurements come from electron/muon reconstruction and identification efficiency and pile-up modeling uncertainties. For VBF and \(VH\), jet energy scale/resolution and QCD scale uncertainties related to bin migration are the largest uncertainties. In the \(t\bar{t}H\) production bin, the largest impact comes from the theory uncertainties related to parton shower and to the heavy flavour quark production modeling for the ggF background contribution.

The expected results obtained for HL-LHC projections for scenario S1 (S2) and for Higgs boson absolute rapidity \(|y_{H}|<2.5\) are:

\[\sigma_{\rm ggF}\times{\rm B}(H\to ZZ^{*}) = 1.305^{+0.073}_{-0.072}\left({}^{+0.057}_{-0.056}\right)\,{\rm pb}\] \[= 1.305^{+0.026}_{-0.026}\ ({\rm stat})\ ^{+0.055}_{-0.056}\left({}^{+0.046}_{-0.046}\right)\ ({\rm exp})\ ^{+0.034}_{-0.031}\left({}^{+0.021}_{-0.020}\right)\ ({\rm sig})\ ^{+0.009}_{-0.009}\left({}^{+0.008}_{-0.008}\right)\ ({\rm bkg})\ {\rm pb}\] \[\sigma_{\rm VBF}\times{\rm B}(H\to ZZ^{*}) = 0.104^{+0.015}_{-0.014}\left({}^{+0.013}_{-0.012}\right)\,{\rm pb}\] \[= 0.104^{+0.010}_{-0.010}\ ({}^{+0.006}_{-0.005}\left({}^{+0.006}_{-0.005 }\right)\ ({\rm exp})\ ^{+0.009}_{-0.008}\left({}^{+0.005}_{-0.005}\right)\ ({\rm sig})\ ^{+0.001}_{-0.001}\left({}^{+0.001}_{-0.001}\right)\ ({\rm bkg})\ {\rm pb}\] \[\sigma_{\rm VH}\times{\rm B}(H\to ZZ^{*}) = 0.058^{+0.012}_{-0.011}\left({}^{+0.011}_{-0.010}\right)\,{\rm pb}\] \[= 0.058^{+0.010}_{-0.010}\ ({\rm stat})\ ^{+0.003}_{-0.002}\left({}^{+0.002}_{-0.002}\right)\ ({\rm exp})\ ^{+0.005}_{-0.004}\left({}^{+0.004}_{-0.003}\right)\ ({\rm sig})\ ^{+0.001}_{-0.001}\left({}^{+0.001}_{<0.001}\right)\ ({\rm bkg})\ {\rm pb}\] \[\sigma_{\rm t\bar{t}H}\times{\rm B}(H\to ZZ^{*}) = 0.016^{+0.004}_{-0.003}\left({}^{+0.004}_{-0.003}\right)\,{\rm pb}\] \[= 0.016^{+0.003}_{-0.003}\ ({\rm stat})\ ^{+0.001}_{-0.001}\ ({\rm exp})\ ^{+0.002}_{-0.001}\left({}^{+0.001}_{-0.001}\right)\ ({\rm sig})\ ^{+0.001}_{-0.001}\left({}^{+0.001}_{<0.001}\right)\ ({\rm bkg})\ {\rm pb}\]

These results are compared to the SM prediction in Figure 4; the SM uncertainties are divided by two compared to their current values, which approximately corresponds to the scaling expected from scenario S2.

To better compare the results of the Run 2 analysis and the extrapolated results with scenarios S1 and S2, Table 2 shows the uncertainties on the measured cross-section results divided by the predicted SM values.

Figure 4: For each production mode, expected result for the measurement of the cross section times branching ratio normalised to their SM expectation for the \(ZZ^{*}\) final state in scenario S2 at HL-LHC is shown for Higgs boson absolute rapidity \(|y_{H}|<2.5\). The statistical (yellow) and systematic (blue) uncertainty components are displayed as well as the theory uncertainty on the SM prediction (grey). The blue band of the systematic uncertainty includes both experimental and theory uncertainties.

Table 2: Expected precision of the production-mode cross-section measurements in the \(H\to ZZ^{*}\) channel with 80 fb\({}^{-1}\) of Run 2 data and at HL-LHC. Uncertainties are reported relative to the SM cross section at the corresponding center-of-mass energy. Both scenarios S1 and S2 have been considered for the systematic uncertainties in the HL-LHC extrapolation. The last column shows the theory uncertainty component when the measurement parameters are production mode signal strengths instead of cross sections. The value for the \(t\bar{t}H\) channel with Run 2 data corresponds to the 95% CL limit.

For the ggF production mode, both scenarios S1 and S2 have larger systematic uncertainties than statistical uncertainties. For the other production modes, the statistical uncertainty dominates. For scenario S2, the signal theory (experimental) uncertainty is the largest systematic component for the \(t\bar{t}H\) and \(VH\) production modes (VBF production mode).

For scenario S2, the plots with the largest systematic uncertainties impacting the cross section and the signal strength respectively are shown in Figures 5 and 6 for the four production modes.

For the ggF production mode, the dominant systematic uncertainties for the cross-section measurement are the electron reconstruction and identification efficiencies, and the luminosity uncertainty. For the signal strength measurement the largest uncertainty is related to QCD scale uncertainty. The second largest source of signal theory uncertainty is related to the PDF uncertainties. These two theory uncertainties affect mostly the signal normalisation and therefore have a negligible impact on the ggF cross-section measurement accuracy.

For the VBF mode, the uncertainties related to the jet energy scale, the underlying event tune and parton shower and the QCD scale uncertainty for ggF events with jet bin migration passing the VBF selection, impact significantly both for the cross section and signal strength measurement.

For the \(VH\) mode the QCD scale uncertainty for ggF events with jet bin migration passing the \(VH\) event selection is the largest systematic uncertainty. The QCD scale uncertainty on the predicted \(VH\) cross section has a large impact only on \(\mu_{\rm VH}\).

For the \(t\bar{t}H\) production mode, the uncertainty related to heavy flavour quark production modeling for the ggF background contribution has a large impact on the cross-section measurement. In addition to this last uncertainty, the QCD scale uncertainty on the total cross-section prediction also impacts the \(t\bar{t}H\) signal strength measurement.

### \(H\to WW^{*}\)

Using a dataset corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 36.1 fb\({}^{-1}\) at Run 2, measurements of the cross sections times \(H\to WW^{*}\) branching ratio have been reported in Ref. [9] for Higgs bosons produced via gluon-gluon fusion ggF and vector-boson fusion VBF and decaying via the \(H\to WW^{*}\to e\nu\mu\nu\) channel. Signal regions for the measurement of gluon-gluon-fusion production are selected within events with less than 2 jets. A vector-boson fusion enriched category is defined using events with two or more jets. The normalisation of (non-resonant) \(WW\), top (\(t\bar{t}\) and \(Wt\)), and \(Z\to\tau\tau\) backgrounds are set using dedicated control regions enriched with events from ggF and VBF processes, using similar selections as that used for the corresponding signal regions.

The expected results obtained for HL-LHC projections for scenarios S1(S2) are:

\[\sigma_{\rm ggF}\times\rm{B}(H\to WW^{*}) = 11.7^{+0.75}_{-0.76}\begin{pmatrix}+0.54\\ -0.52\end{pmatrix}\ \rm{pb}\] \[= 11.7^{+0.12}_{-0.12}\ (\rm{stat})\begin{pmatrix}+0.43\\ -0.43\end{pmatrix}\begin{pmatrix}+0.35\\ -0.34\end{pmatrix}\ (\rm{exp})\begin{pmatrix}+0.39\\ -0.42\end{pmatrix}\ (\rm{sig})\begin{pmatrix}+0.47\\ -0.46\end{pmatrix}\begin{pmatrix}+0.23\\ -0.27\end{pmatrix}\ (\rm{bkg})\ \rm{pb}\] \[\sigma_{\rm VBF}\times\rm{B}(H\to WW^{*}) = 0.916^{+0.099}_{-0.100}\begin{pmatrix}+0.061\\ -0.060\end{pmatrix}\ \rm{pb}\] \[= 0.916^{+0.030}_{-0.030}\ (\rm{stat})\begin{pmatrix}+0.050\\ -0.044\end{pmatrix}\begin{pmatrix}+0.027\\ -0.027\end{pmatrix}\ (\rm{exp})\begin{pmatrix}+0.064\\ -0.061\end{pmatrix}\begin{pmatrix}+0.035\\ -0.034\end{pmatrix}\ (\rm{sig})\begin{pmatrix}+0.051\\ -0.059\end{pmatrix}\begin{pmatrix}+0.029\\ -0.030\end{pmatrix}\ (\rm{bkg})\ \rm{pb}\]

These results are compared to the SM prediction in Figure 7; the SM uncertainties are divided by two compared to their current values, which approximately corresponds to the scaling expected from scenario S2. The figure shows that, at HL-LHC, the ggF cross-section measurement will reach a level of precision which is similar to that of the theory predictions.

Table 3 lists the total expected uncertainties on the cross section times branching ratio, as well as the contributions from statistical, experimental, signal and background theory uncertainties.

Figure 7: For each production mode, expected result for the measurement of the cross section times branching ratio normalised to their SM expectation for the \(WW^{*}\) final state in scenario S2 at HL-LHC is shown. The statistical (yellow) and systematic (blue) uncertainty components are displayed as well as the theory uncertainty on the SM prediction (grey). The blue band of the systematic uncertainty includes both experimental and theory uncertainties.

Figures 8 and 9 show the expected ranking of the leading sources of systematic uncertainties for the measured cross section times branching ratio and signal strength respectively, for the gluon-gluon fusion and vector-boson fusion processes.

For the measured ggF cross section, the uncertainty related to the estimation of background contributions due to jets misidentified as muons, so called _fake muons_, and to the efficiency for actual muons are ranked higher in scenario S2, as these particular uncertainties are unchanged with respect to their Run 2 values. While the yield of \(Z/\gamma^{*}\) events in the ggF enriched signal regions is small the corresponding

Table 3: Expected precision of the production-mode cross-section measurements in the \(H\to WW^{*}\) channel with 36 fb\({}^{-1}\) of Run 2 data and at HL-LHC. Uncertainties are reported relative to the SM cross section at the corresponding center-of-mass energy. Both HL-LHC scenarios have been considered for the systematic uncertainties. The last column shows the theory uncertainty component when the measurement parameters are production-mode signal strengths instead of cross sections.

enriched control regions contain a non-negligible number of events with fake leptons. The normalisation of the \(Z/\gamma^{*}\) background can therefore indirectly affect the measured signal via fake lepton related nuisance parameters. Similarly the \(t\bar{t}+Wt\) enriched control region with \(\geq 2\) jets can provide additional constraints to the identification efficiency of jets originating from bottom quarks and thus on the \(t\bar{t}+Wt\) event yield in the signal regions. Theory uncertainties on the parton shower modeling and PDFs also have a similar impact on the ggF cross-section measurement.

The measurement in the vector-boson fusion channel shows similar rankings of systematic uncertainty sources for both the cross-section and signal strength measurements.

Besides the uncertainty due to the dependency of the jet energy scale on the jet flavour composition, the leading sources of uncertainties are mostly related to the acceptance of different signal and background processes in the VBF enriched phase space.

### \(H\to\tau\tau\)

The measurement of the total cross section of the Higgs boson in the \(H\to\tau\tau\) channel has been published in Ref. [10]. The analysis was performed on data collected in 2015 and 2016 corresponding to \(36.1\,\mathrm{fb}^{-1}\) at \(\sqrt{s}=13\,\mathrm{TeV}\).

For the Higgs boson decay products all the leptonic (\(\tau_{\mathrm{lep}}\)) and hadronic (\(\tau_{\mathrm{had}}\)) decays of the \(\tau\)'s are considered. The analysis is done by splitting events into three categories depending on the possible \(\tau\tau\) final states: (\(\tau_{\mathrm{lep}}\), \(\tau_{\mathrm{lep}}\)), (\(\tau_{\mathrm{lep}}\), \(\tau_{\mathrm{had}}\)) and (\(\tau_{\mathrm{had}}\), \(\tau_{\mathrm{had}}\)).

The main backgrounds differ significantly between these three channels, as do the techniques used to determine them. For all final states, two categories targeting the VBF and ggF production modes are used. These two categories are further split in 13 exclusive signal regions, dependent on the decay channel.

The dominant uncertainties in Run 2 for the measured cross-section are theory uncertainties on the signal model, the uncertainty due to jets and \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\) and the uncertainty due to background statistics, which include statistical uncertainties both of the simulated backgrounds and of the misidentified \(\tau\) backgrounds, estimated using data.

The expected results for the cross sections times \(H\to\tau\tau\) branching ratio of the two production modes at HL-LHC for the scenario S1 (S2) are:

\[\sigma_{\mathrm{ggF}}\times\mathrm{B}(H\to\tau\tau) =3.43^{+0.79}_{-0.63}\left({}^{+0.42}_{-0.37}\right)\,\mathrm{pb}\] \[=3.43^{+0.11}_{-0.11}\,\left(\mathrm{stat}\right)\,{}^{+0.21}_{-0. 13}\left({}^{+0.14}_{-0.13}\right)\,\left(\mathrm{exp}\right)\,{}^{+0.70}_{-0. 55}\left({}^{+0.36}_{-0.31}\right)\,\left(\mathrm{sig}\right)\,{}^{+0.27}_{-0. 19}\left({}^{+0.11}_{-0.08}\right)\,\left(\mathrm{bkg}\right)\,\mathrm{pb}\] \[\sigma_{\mathrm{VBF}}\times\mathrm{B}(H\to\tau\tau) =0.268^{+0.025}_{-0.025}\left({}^{+0.021}_{-0.020}\right)\, \mathrm{pb}\] \[=0.268^{+0.009}_{-0.009}\,\left(\mathrm{stat}\right)\,{}^{+0.014} _{-0.015}\left({}^{+0.013}_{-0.012}\right)\,\left(\mathrm{exp}\right)\,{}^{+0. 017}_{-0.014}\left({}^{+0.007}_{-0.009}\right)\,\left(\mathrm{sig}\right)\,{}^{ +0.009}_{-0.009}\left({}^{+0.010}_{-0.010}\right)\,\left(\mathrm{bkg}\right)\, \mathrm{pb}\]

These results are compared to the SM prediction in Figure 10; the SM uncertainties are divided by two compared to their current values, which approximately corresponds to the scaling for the scenario S2.

Table 4 lists the total expected uncertainties on the cross section normalised to their SM values as well as the contributions from each uncertainty component. It's worthwhile to note that for this channel the breakdown of the systematics uncertainties for the scenarios S1 and S2 has been done differently from that used in the Run 2 analysis [10].

In Figure 11 the expected ranking of the systematic uncertainties for the scenario S2 with the largest impact on the measured inclusive ggF and VBF cross sections times \(H\to\tau\tau\) branching ratio and signal strength is shown. Both measurements are largely affected by the QCD uncertainties related to the signal acceptance. The largest contribution to the total uncertainty comes from the theory signal uncertainty.

### \(Vh,h\to b\bar{b}\)

The HL-LHC projections for the \(VH\), \(H\to b\bar{b}\) channel are performed using extrapolations based on the results of the analysis of 79.8 fb\({}^{-1}\) of pp collision data collected at \(\sqrt{s}\) = 13 TeV [11]. The same statistical framework and analysis approach are used. In particular the same selection and event categories, for both signal and control regions are utilised.

The three cross sections for \(WH\), \(q\bar{q}\to ZH\) and \(gg\to ZH\) production times the \(H\to b\bar{b}\) branching ratio are determined from a fit where the three parameters are left free.

The measured product of the cross-section times the \(H\to b\bar{b}\) branching ratio for each signal process, are the following, where the uncertainties outside (inside) the parentheses correspond to scenario S1 (S2):

\[\sigma(WH)\times\text{B}(H\to b\bar{b}) =0.877\,^{+0.131}_{-0.121}(^{+0.091}_{-0.088})\text{ pb}\] \[=0.877\,^{+0.036}_{-0.036}(^{+0.036}_{-0.036})\text{ (stat)}^{+0.042}_{-0.041}(^{+0.039}_{-0.038})\text{ (exp)}\] \[\qquad\qquad\,{}^{+0.070}_{-0.061}(^{+0.040}_{-0.036})\text{ (sig)}^{+0.095}_{-0.088}(^{+0.063}_{-0.061})\text{ (bkg) pb}\]

\[\sigma(q\bar{q}\to ZH)\times\text{B}(H\to b\bar{b}) =0.488\,^{+0.067}_{-0.064}(^{+0.059}_{-0.058})\text{ pb}\] \[=0.488\,^{+0.044}_{-0.043}(^{+0.044}_{-0.043})\text{ (stat)}^{+0.032}_{-0.031}(^{+0.028}_{-0.027})\text{ (exp)}\] \[\qquad\qquad\,{}^{+0.030}_{-0.027}(^{+0.015}_{-0.014})\text{ (sig)}^{+0.026}_{-0.023}(^{+0.023}_{-0.022})\text{ (bkg) pb}\]

\[\sigma(gg\to ZH)\times\text{B}(H\to b\bar{b}) =0.084\,^{+0.042}_{-0.041}(^{+0.036}_{-0.036})\text{ pb}\] \[=0.084\,^{+0.028}_{-0.028}(^{+0.028}_{-0.028})\text{ (stat)}^{+0.021}_{-0.021}(^{+0.017}_{-0.017})\text{ (exp)}\] \[\qquad\qquad\,{}^{+0.015}_{-0.012}(^{+0.008}_{-0.007})\text{ (sig)}^{+0.017}_{-0.018}(^{+0.015}_{-0.015})\text{ (bkg) pb}\]

These numbers are translated in relative precision in Table 5. It's worthwhile to note that for this channel the breakdown of the systematics uncertainties for the scenarios S1 and S2 has been done differently from that used in the Run 2 analysis [11].

modes. Figure 15 shows the expected precision of the measured cross sections when the \(gg\) and \(q\bar{q}\) to \(ZH\) production modes are combined. It's worthwhile to note that in this latter fit, the uncertainty on the inclusive \(ZH\) signal process is much smaller than the uncertainties on the single \(q\bar{q}\to ZH\) and \(gg\to ZH\) processes, due to correlations between their measurements.

The individual cross section values for the three processes are obtained from a simultaneous fit in which the cross section parameters for the \(WH\), \(q\bar{q}\to ZH\) and \(gg\to ZH\) processes are floating independently.

### \(t\bar{t}H\)

The ATLAS Collaboration has searched for the \(t\bar{t}H\) production with LHC Run 2 data collected in 2015, 2016, and 2017, and observed Higgs boson production in association with a top-quark pair [12]. This analysis is sensitive to a large variety of final-state event topologies, \(H\to WW^{*}\), \(H\to ZZ^{*}\), \(H\to\tau^{+}\tau^{-}\), \(H\to b\bar{b}\) and \(H\to\gamma\gamma\). They are all considered in what follows except the \(H\to\gamma\gamma\) and \(H\to ZZ^{*}\) final states which were covered in the Section 2.1 and 2.2, respectively.

The projection studies performed in this section are based on the extrapolation to HL-LHC of the published Run 2 results [13, 14] using the 2015-2016 dataset (36 fb\({}^{-1}\)) for the \(t\bar{t}H,H\to b\bar{b}\) and the \(t\bar{t}H,H\to\) ML (multi-lepton final state) channels. This latter channel includes the \(H\to WW^{*}\), \(H\to ZZ^{*}\), \(H\to\tau^{+}\tau^{-}\) final states, which are categorised according to the number of hadronically decaying \(\tau\) leptons and the number of electrons or muons candidates in the event.

For the \(t\bar{t}H,H\to\)ML channel, the rankings of the top 10 nuisance parameters when fitting the cross section and the signal strength as a parameter of interest are reported in Figures 16 and 17 respectively, separating the selections which include (a) or exclude (b) hadronically decaying \(\tau\) leptons.

In the \(t\bar{t}H,H\to\)ML including \(\tau\) channel the dominant uncertainties are related to the treatment of the reconstruction of the \(\tau\) leptons in the final state. In the \(t\bar{t}H,H\to\)ML excluding \(\tau\) channel the modeling for the \(t\bar{t}Z\) background is the largest systematic uncertainty. Leading uncertainties for both ML channels relate to the treatment of misidentified leptons in the control and signal regions. These uncertainties are not reduced in scenario S2 and some of them are constrained with 3000 fb\({}^{-1}\), as shown in Figures 16 and 17. It's worthwhile to note that those uncertainties are dominated by the statistics from control regions and therefore they are expected to decrease significantly at HL-LHC.

For the extrapolation of the \(t\bar{t}H,H\to b\bar{b}\) channel, the large dataset of 3000 fb\({}^{-1}\) causes significant constraints on the background theoretical uncertainties, mostly those related to the description of the \(t\bar{t}\)+heavy flavour background component, as shown in Figures 16 and 17. This component is estimated in the Run 2 analysis as a large two-point systematics which encompasses the differences between several Monte Carlo simulations with respect to the nominal Powheg Pythia8 simulation and dominates the total uncertainty. The constraints on those uncertainties at 3000 fb\({}^{-1}\) induce a large reduction of the post-fit impact for the background theoretical uncertainties, which lead to a non realistic extrapolation. Therefore, the extrapolation of the \(t\bar{t}H,H\to b\bar{b}\) channel has been performed injecting an additional uncertainty to get a reduction of a factor two (three) on the post-fit impact of the background theoretical uncertainties, respectively for scenario S1(S2). Such factors are consistent with the expected theory improvement on the uncertainty on the \(t\bar{t}\)+heavy flavour channel, as reported in Ref. [15]. The other uncertainties are treated as for the other channels in the note. The next largest experimental uncertainties in scenario S2 are related to flavour tagging and jet reconstruction.

Table 6 reports the value of the uncertainty on the cross section, normalised to the SM value, split in total uncertainty, statistical, experimental, and theory components, for both the \(t\bar{t}H,H\to b\bar{b}\) and the \(t\bar{t}H,H\to\) ML channels. The last column reports the theory signal uncertainty on the signal strength, which includes also the theoretical error on the predicted SM cross-section.

### 2.7 \(H\to\mu\mu\)

ATLAS has presented a search for the decay of the Higgs boson to a pair of muons using 79.8 fb\({}^{-1}\) of data collected at center-of-mass energy of \(\sqrt{s}=13\) TeV [16]. The event selection is loose both at the muon object level and event level in order to retain as much signal as possible and the selected events are categorised to improve sensitivity. VBF-like events are first selected using a multivariate BDT classifier and split into two VBF-like categories of different purity. The remaining events are further split in 6 orthogonal categories based on signal purity and muon momentum resolution. The invariant mass distribution of the \(m_{\mu\mu}\) signal is modelled using a weighted sum of a Gaussian and a Crystal Ball function, with parameter sets for each category based on the dimuon pseudorapidities and determined by a fit to simulated events. Background estimation, dominated by \(Z/\gamma^{*}\to\mu\mu\), is fully data driven and is modelled using a weighted sum of a Breit-Wigner convolved by a Gaussian and an exponential function. The Run 2 analysis is limited by the statistical uncertainty, while the leading systematic uncertainty is the bias introduced by the choice of the function describing the background. This contribution is set to zero for the HL-LHC extrapolation. The other important uncertainties on the signal strength measurement include QCD scale, jet binning and Higgs boson \(p_{\rm T}\) theoretical uncertainties.

This analysis is used as baseline to extrapolate the expected precision of the measurement at HL-LHC. In addition to the standard extrapolation procedure, the widths of the signal dimuon mass peaks are reduced in the Central and VBF categories by 30% and by 15% in the Forward categories to account for expected improvements in the muon \(p_{\rm T}\) resolution in the new tracker system used at HL-LHC [17].

In the scenario S2 case, the most important reductions on systematic uncertainties are related to the signal modeling, namely Higgs boson \(p_{\rm T}\), jet binning, and QCD scale, which are all reduced by 50%.

The results of the Run 2 analysis with 79.8 fb\({}^{-1}\) of data at \(\sqrt{s}=13\) TeV are compared to the results at HL-LHC with 3000 fb\({}^{-1}\) of data at \(\sqrt{s}=14\) TeV in Table 7.

Figure 18 shows the 10 systematic uncertainties with the largest impact on the signal strength measurement for scenario S2.

In both systematic uncertainty scenarios at HL-LHC, the expected precision of the measurement will be limited by the statistical uncertainty.

### \(H\to Z\gamma\)

The search for the \(Z\gamma\) decay of the Higgs boson was performed using 36.1 fb\({}^{-1}\) at \(\sqrt{s}=13\) TeV [18]. The observed (expected assuming SM Higgs hypothesis) upper limit on the production cross section times the branching ratio for \(pp\to H\to Z\gamma\) is 6.6 (5.2) at the 95% confidence level for a Higgs boson mass of 125.09 GeV.

In this analysis, the event categorisation was optimised to improve the search sensitivity. VBF events were selected using a BDT. The analysis is strongly driven by the statistical uncertainty. The main systematic uncertainty comes from the bias induced by the choice of the background function.

The extrapolation to HL-LHC is performed with a simple scaling scenario. The modelings of the signal and background shape are kept as the above analysis. All the experimental and systematic uncertainties are also the same as before except the uncertainty from the background function choice which is taken to be negligible. With this scenario, the expected significance of the SM Higgs boson is 4.9 \(\sigma\) with 3000 fb\({}^{-1}\). As summarised in Table 8 for the cross section times branching ratio for \(pp\to H\to Z\gamma\), the precision for this measurement is expected to be 0.23 times the SM prediction. No number is provided for the current Run 2 integrated luminosity as the significance is too small. The expected measurement precision on the signal strength is evaluated to be 0.24.

Even with the whole HL-LHC dataset, the analysis sensitivity is strongly limited by the statistical component even with the conservative scenario S1. Among those different systematic uncertainty sources, the uncertainty from missing higher order corrections is the dominant one. To simplify the combination with other channels in Section 3, the systematic uncertainties for scenario S2 are assumed to be equal to the scenario S1 values.

\begin{tabular}{l|c|c c} \hline \hline Scenario & \(\Delta_{\text{tot}}/\sigma_{\text{SM}}\) & \(\Delta_{\text{stat}}/\sigma_{\text{SM}}\) & \(\Delta_{\text{syst}}/\sigma_{\text{SM}}\) \\ \hline HL-LHC S1 & 0.23 & 0.20 & 0.11 \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}

## 3 Combination

### Introduction

The results on the combination are obtained from a likelihood function defined as the product of the likelihoods of each input analysis. These are themselves products of likelihoods computed in mutually exclusive regions selected in the analysis, referred to as analysis categories. Since the input analyses are all based on scaling up expected results from the corresponding Run 2 versions, the correlation of nuisance parameters between channels is largely unchanged with respect to Ref. [19]. In particular, the branching ratio uncertainties have been broken down into different sources in order to take their correlations properly into account. The only differences are the following:

1. All the nuisance parameters corresponding to experimental uncertainties in the \(t\bar{t}H\), \(H\to b\bar{b}\) channel are uncorrelated from other channels due to the large constraints introduced at high luminosity in this channel.
2. All the nuisance parameters in the \(H\to Z\gamma\) channel are uncorrelated from other channels. The impact from potential correlations is negligible, as this channel is limited by its statistical uncertainty.

Two sets of combinations, differing in signal theory uncertainty implementation and also in input channels, are performed.

1. **Cross-section combination**: the first combination is for measuring production mode cross sections and decay branching ratios. The exact configuration of theory uncertainties vary according to the assumptions involved in each measurement: * When measuring ratios of production-mode cross sections times decay branching ratios or the production-mode cross section in each decay channel, only theory uncertainties affecting the acceptance are considered. Neither QCD scale and PDF+\(\alpha_{S}\) uncertainties on the cross sections, nor branching ratio uncertainties are included, since they affect only the signal normalisation. * When measuring production mode cross sections, in addition to the uncertainties related to the signal acceptance considered in the first case, the uncertainties on the assumed SM branching ratios are included. * When measuring decay branching ratios, in addition to the uncertainties related to the signal acceptance considered in the first case, uncertainties on the assumed SM cross sections, related to QCD scale and PDF+\(\alpha_{S}\) uncertainties are included. The two rare decay channels, \(H\to\mu\mu\) and \(H\to Z\gamma\), are excluded from the combination of production mode measurements because their sensitivities are negligible. They are not used in the combination for the production mode cross sections per different decay channel measurement due to their negligible correlation with other channels but their results are added to the plots and tables for completeness.
2. **Signal strength combination**: the second combination is used to perform the combined measurement of the Higgs signal strength, as well as the interpretation of the measurements within the \(\kappa\) model. The full theory uncertainties on the predicted cross sections and branching ratios are included. All the input channels, including \(H\to\mu\mu\) and \(H\to Z\gamma\), are included in the combination.

For each combination, the two systematic uncertainty scenarios S1 and S2 are considered. The same statistical methods as those used for the Run 2 combined measurements in Ref. [19] are used. Unless otherwise specified, projections discussed in the following sub-sections are based on an integrated luminosity of 3000 fb\({}^{-1}\).

### Global signal strength

The global signal strength \(\mu\) is defined as the ratio of the observed yields to their SM expectations. It corresponds to a global scaling of the expected Higgs boson yield in all categories by a single value. Its value depends on the SM predictions for each production-mode cross section and decay branching ratio.

The expected precision of the measurement of the global signal strength for the systematic scenario S1 (S2) is:

\[\mu =1.000^{+0.038}_{-0.037}\left({}^{+0.025}_{-0.024}\right)\] \[=1.000\pm 0.006\ (\mathrm{stat})\ \pm 0.016\ (0.013)\ (\mathrm{exp})\ ^{+0.030}_{-0.028}\left({}^{+0.017}_{-0.017}\right)\ (\mathrm{sig})\ ^{+0.016}_{-0.015}\ \left({}^{+0.010}_{-0.010}\right)\ (\mathrm{bkg})\]

### Production cross sections

In this model, the measurement parameters are the cross sections for the five studied Higgs boson production modes: ggF, VBF, \(WH\), \(ZH\) and combination of \(t\bar{t}H\) and \(tH\) (\(t\bar{t}H\)+\(tH\)). The latter assumes their relative fractions to be as in the SM and for simplicity is labelled as \(t\bar{t}H\) in the following for all the models. The small contribution from \(b\bar{b}H\) is grouped with ggF. The \(ZH\) process includes \(ZH\) production with gluon-gluon initial state. The measurement is performed assuming SM values for its decay branching fractions. The expected production cross-section uncertainties obtained with 3000 fb\({}^{-1}\) are shown in Table 9 for scenarios S1 and S2.

The expected precision of the production cross-section measurement with only 300 fb\({}^{-1}\) at \(\sqrt{s}\) = 14 TeV is shown in Table 10. Concerning the systematic uncertainties, the same scenarios S1 and S2 are considered. The expected production cross-section uncertainties obtained with 3000 fb\({}^{-1}\) are summarised in Figure 19. Figure 20 summarises the total uncertainties for both scenarios. Even for scenario S2, all production-mode cross-section measurements are limited by systematic uncertainties. All correlations are 0.08 or less, with the exception of that of \(t\bar{t}H\) and ggF which is 0.16.

### Ratios of cross sections and branching fractions

Ratios of cross sections and of branching fractions are measured using as reference the cross section of the \(gg\to H\to ZZ^{*}\) process, \(\sigma_{gg\,F}^{ZZ}\). The products \((\sigma\times\mathrm{B})_{if}\) of production cross sections in the process \(i\) and branching fraction into the final state \(f\) are expressed as

\[(\sigma\times\mathrm{B})_{\mathrm{if}}=\sigma_{\mathrm{ggF}}^{\mathrm{ZZ}} \cdot\left(\frac{\sigma_{i}}{\sigma_{\mathrm{ggF}}}\right)\cdot\left(\frac{ \mathrm{B}_{f}}{\mathrm{B}_{\mathrm{ZZ}}}\right), \tag{1}\]

The uncertainties on the measurements of these parameters for scenario S1 and S2 are shown in Table 14 and well as in Figure 25. The uncertainties for the two scenarios are summarized in Figure 26.

The values are obtained from a simultaneous fit to all decay channels.

### Measurement of coupling parameters in the \(\kappa\) framework

This section discusses the measurements of coupling parameters in the "\(\kappa\) framework" [3], as already included in the Run 1 combination [1]. In this framework, the (\(\sigma\times\mathrm{B}\)) for the various Higgs boson production and decay modes are expressed in the narrow-width approximation as

\[\sigma_{i}\times\mathrm{B}(H\to f)=\frac{\sigma_{i}\times\Gamma_{f}}{\Gamma_{H} }=\frac{\kappa_{i}^{2}\kappa_{f}^{2}}{\kappa_{H}^{2}}\sigma_{i}^{\mathrm{SM}} \times\mathrm{B}^{\mathrm{SM}}(H\to f) \tag{2}\]

where \(\kappa_{i}\) and \(\kappa_{f}\) are multiplicative factors applied on the SM production and decay amplitudes respectively, and the factor \(\kappa_{H}^{2}\) is applied on the total Higgs boson decay width \(\Gamma_{H}\).

The \(\kappa_{i},\kappa_{f}\) are then expressed in terms of multiplicative factors applied to the Higgs boson couplings to SM particles, using expressions inspired by the leading-order Feynman diagrams for the corresponding processes. Factors related to fundamental couplings in the SM are \(\kappa_{W}\), \(\kappa_{Z}\), \(\kappa_{t}\), \(\kappa_{b}\), \(\kappa_{\tau}\) and \(\kappa_{\mu}\).

Couplings \(\kappa_{g}\) for the ggF vertex, \(\kappa_{\gamma}\) for the \(H\gamma\gamma\) vertex and \(\kappa_{Z\gamma}\) for the \(HZ\gamma\) vertex are expressed either as a function of the more fundamental factors \(\kappa_{W}\), \(\kappa_{Z}\), \(\kappa_{t}\), \(\kappa_{b}\), \(\kappa_{\tau}\) and \(\kappa_{\mu}\) or kept as effective modifiers.

The \(\kappa_{H}^{2}\) parameter can be expressed as

\[\kappa_{H}^{2}=\frac{\sum_{f}\kappa_{f}^{2}\mathrm{B}^{\mathrm{SM}}(H\to f)}{ 1-\mathrm{B}_{\mathrm{BSM}}} \tag{3}\]

where \(\mathrm{B}_{\mathrm{BSM}}\) includes both invisible decays and modifications to visible decays which are not measured in the analyses included in the combination.

The measurement of the \(\kappa_{j}\) requires knowledge of \(\kappa_{H}\): since on-shell Higgs boson \(\sigma\times\mathrm{B}\) measurements only measure \(\kappa_{i}/\kappa_{H}\), the \(\kappa_{i}\) would otherwise be known only up to a common multiplicative factor. Since \(\mathrm{B}_{\mathrm{BSM}}\) cannot be unambiguously measured at LHC, this requires specific assumptions. These assumptions can be any of the following:

* Assume \(\mathrm{B}_{\mathrm{BSM}}=0\), so that \(\kappa_{H}\) can be expressed simply in terms of the measured \(\kappa_{j}\).
* Include BSM contributions to the Higgs boson total width through the parameter \(\mathrm{B}_{\mathrm{BSM}}\), constrained by assuming \(\mathrm{B}_{\mathrm{BSM}}\geq 0\) and \(\kappa_{W,Z}\leq 1\). The latter condition holds true for a broad class of extensions of the SM and disfavors large values of \(\mathrm{B}_{\mathrm{BSM}}\)[3].
* Use off-shell measurements to constrain the Higgs boson total width and therefore \(\kappa_{H}^{2}\), as was done in the ATLAS Run 1 combination [1].
* Probe ratios of coupling modifiers, which can be measured without any assumption on the total width of the Higgs boson

The formulas for each case are listed in Ref. [2].

#### 3.7.1 Couplings to fermions vs. couplings to weak vector bosons

In this model, we assume a single coupling modifier for all fermions (\(\kappa_{F}\)) and for all weak vector bosons (\(\kappa_{V}\)). In addition, we assume only SM particles contribute to the total width of the Higgs boson so that \(\text{B}_{\text{BSM}}=0\). The effective couplings \(\kappa_{g}\) and \(\kappa_{\gamma}\) and the total width modifier \(\kappa_{H}\) are expressed in terms of \(\kappa_{F}\) and \(\kappa_{V}\). The cross sections for the ggF and \(t\bar{t}H\) production processes scale with \(\kappa_{F}^{2}\), while those of VBF and \(VH\) productions are proportional to \(\kappa_{V}^{2}\). The \(H\to ZZ^{*}\) and \(H\to WW^{*}\) partial widths are proportional to \(\kappa_{V}^{2}\), while those of \(H\to b\bar{b}\) and \(H\to\tau\tau\) scale with \(\kappa_{F}^{2}\). The \(H\to\gamma\gamma\) branching fraction depends on a combination of \(\kappa_{V}^{2}\), \(\kappa_{F}^{2}\), and \(\kappa_{V}\cdot\kappa_{F}\) due to contributions from top-quark loops, \(W\)-boson loops and their interference to the decay process. The \(\kappa_{V}\) parameter is assumed to be positive without loss of generality, and \(\kappa_{F}\) is assumed to be positive since its negative range was excluded by previous measurements [20].

The expected contours at 68 and 95% CL in the \(\kappa_{V}\) and \(\kappa_{F}\) plane for scenarios S1 and S2 are shown in Figure 27.

#### 3.7.2 Probe BSM contributions to the production and decay loops

In this model, the coupling modifiers \(\kappa_{g}\) for the ggF vertex and \(\kappa_{\gamma}\) for the \(H\to\gamma\gamma\) vertex are used as effective coupling modifiers.

The two modifiers are assumed to be positive without loss of generality. All other coupling modifiers related to SM particles are fixed to their SM values. No BSM contribution is included in the Higgs boson total width. Contours in the plane of \(\kappa_{\gamma}\) and \(\kappa_{g}\) for scenarios S1 and S2 are shown in Figure 28.

#### 3.7.3 Parametrisation assuming SM structure of the loops and no BSM contributions in decays

In this model, separate modifiers \(\kappa_{W}\) and \(\kappa_{Z}\) are considered for couplings to \(W\) and \(Z\) bosons, respectively. Separate couplings \(\kappa_{t}\), \(\kappa_{b}\), \(\kappa_{\tau}\) and \(\kappa_{\mu}\) are also introduced, respectively, for couplings to top and charm quarks, bottom and strange quarks, \(\tau\) leptons, and muons. SM values are assumed for couplings to first-generation fermions and no BSM contribution to the Higgs boson total width is included. All couplings are assumed to be positive except \(\kappa_{W}\) and \(\kappa_{Z}\). The results are shown in Table 15.

Reduced coupling strength modifiers are defined for fermions (\(F=t,b,\tau,\mu\)) as \(\kappa_{F}\frac{m_{F}}{v}\), and for gauge bosons (\(V=W,Z\)) as \(\sqrt{\kappa_{V}}\frac{m_{V}}{v}\), where \(\kappa_{F}\) (\(\kappa_{V}\)) is the coupling modifier, \(m_{F}\) (\(m_{V}\)) is the mass of the fermion (boson), and \(v=246\,\mathrm{Ge\kern-1.0ptV}\) is the vacuum expectation value of the Higgs field. The SM prediction is given by \(m/v\) for both cases, where \(m\) is the mass of the fermion or boson. Reduced couplings strengths are shown as a function of mass for the scenarios S1 and S2 in Figure 29.

The SM prediction for both cases is also shown (dotted line). The uncertainties in the scenarios S1 and S2 are displayed in (a) and (b). The couplings modifiers \(\kappa_{F}\) and \(\kappa_{V}\) are measured assuming no BSM contribution to the Higgs boson decays, and the SM structure of loop processes such as ggF, \(H\to\gamma\gamma\) and \(H\to gg\).

7.4 Parametrisation including effective photon and gluon couplings with and without BSM contributions in decays

The two models considered in this section are based on the same parametrisation as the one in Section 3.7.3 but the ggF, \(H\to gg\), \(H\to\gamma\gamma\) and \(H\to Z\gamma\) loop processes are parametrised using the \(\kappa_{g}\), \(\kappa_{\gamma}\) and \(\kappa_{Z\gamma}\) modifiers in the same way as for the model of Section 3.7.2.

In the first model, no BSM contribution to the Higgs boson total width are considered (\(\mathrm{B_{BSM}}=0\)). The measured parameters are \(\kappa_{Z}\), \(\kappa_{W}\), \(\kappa_{b}\), \(\kappa_{t}\), \(\kappa_{\tau}\), \(\kappa_{\gamma}\), \(\kappa_{g}\), \(\kappa_{\mu}\) and \(\kappa_{Z\gamma}\). The sign of \(\kappa_{t}\) can be either positive or negative, while \(\kappa_{Z}\) is assumed to be positive without loss of generality. The uncertainties of the first model without BSM contributions in the Higgs boson total width for scenario S1 and S2 are shown in Table 16.

The uncertainties of the second model which considers BSM in the Higgs boson total width are shown for scenarios S1 and S2 in Table 17. The restricted range of the \(W\) and \(Z\) couplings translates into asymmetric errors on parameters such as \(\kappa_{\mathrm{b}}\) which are largely measured in combination with vector bosons.

Figures 32 and 33 summarise the expected uncertainties for both models without and with BSM contributions. The results in the model with the BSM contributions can be translated into an upper limit for \(\text{B}_{\text{BSM}}\): \(\text{B}_{\text{BSM}}<0.064\) (0.093) at 95 % CL for scenario S2 (S1).

The systematic uncertainties related to the Z\(\gamma\) channel for scenario S2 are assumed to be equal to those used for the scenario S1, since the Z\(\gamma\) measurement is dominated by statistical uncertainties.

## 4 Higgs boson mass with \(ZZ^{*}\to 4\) leptons

The Higgs boson invariant mass has been measured with data collected in 2015 and 2016 (36 fb\({}^{-1}\)) and published in Ref. [21]. The result is \(m_{H}^{ZZ^{*}}\)= 124.79 \(\pm\) 0.36 (stat.) \(\pm\) 0.05 (syst.) GeV. The above analysis has been extrapolated to 3000 fb\({}^{-1}\) considering four scenarios. In the first scenario, the current systematic uncertainties and the current detector performance are assumed, as in the S1 scenario considered in this note. For the other scenarios, an improvement of 30 % in the transverse momentum resolution for muons of 45 GeV is considered, as expected thanks to the new tracking detector foreseen to be used at HL-LHC and whose performances are documented in the Technical Design Report for the ATLAS Inner Tracker Pixel Detector [17]. In the last two scenarios, a reduction of 50% and 80% on the muon transverse momentum uncertainty is assumed.

The total, statistical and systematic uncertainties are shown in Table 21.

It should be noted that a detailed study of the calibration of the muons, electrons and photons with the very large HL-LHC sample has not been done. The large dataset available by the end of HL-LHC will give the opportunity to further optimise the analysis and to significantly reduce the systematic uncertainties on the muon transverse momentum scale.

\begin{tabular}{l|c|c c} \hline \hline  & \(\Delta_{\text{tot}}\) (MeV) & \(\Delta_{\text{stat}}\) (MeV) & \(\Delta_{\text{syst}}\) (MeV) \\ \hline Current Detector & 52 & 39 & 35 \\ \(\mu\) momentum resolution improvement by 30\% or similar & 47 & 30 & 37 \\ \(\mu\) momentum resolution/scale improvement of 30\% / 50\% & 38 & 30 & 24 \\ \(\mu\) momentum resolution/scale improvement 30\% / 80\% & 33 & 30 & 14 \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}

## 5 Conclusion

The measurements of several Higgs boson properties have been extrapolated to the 3000 fb\({}^{-1}\) of integrated luminosity expected at HL-LHC. This large dataset will allow both to improve the measurement precision of the Higgs boson production and decay modes already observed, and to observe the currently unobserved decay modes \(H\to\mu\mu\) and \(H\to Z\gamma\).

In this extrapolation the expected improvements on the theory and experimental systematic uncertainties are taken into account. A precision at the level of few percents will be reached on all the production-mode cross sections and on the main decay channels. Only the measurement precision for the \(W(Z)H,H\to\gamma\gamma\), \(VH,H\to ZZ^{*}\) and \(t\bar{t}H,H\to ZZ^{*}\) channels, beside the two aforementioned rare decays, will be limited by statistical uncertainty. These results highlight the importance of reaching, and eventually further improving, the expected theory and experimental systematic uncertainties in the next decade.

The projected measurement precision on the cross section times branching ratio is interpreted in terms of Higgs boson couplings to fermions and bosons in a variety of models. Projections of the measured ratios of couplings, branching ratios and cross sections are also reported. Finally, the Higgs boson mass is expected to be measured with a precision of the order of few tens of MeV.
