## 1 Introduction

### Outline

The ATLAS solenoid is designed to provide an axial magnetic field of 2 Tesla at the center of the tracking volume. Since the location of the solenoid is chosen to be in front of the EM calorimeter, the material must be kept minimal for the best calorimeter performance. The coil is designed to be as thin as possible without sacrificing its operational safety and reliability. The technology of superconducting magnet using indirectly-cooled aluminum-stabilized superconductor is chosen to achieve the highest possible field with minimum thickness. To maximize the effect of the thin solenoid, the vacuum vessels of the solenoid and of the liquid argon calorimeter are combined into one, eliminating two vacuum walls.

The original LoI design [1] revealed that the total material near the solenoid ends (\(\eta\)=1.46-1.68) was too thick. It was decided to retract the solenoid length by 90 cm as the best compromise between the performance of the EM calorimeter and of the inner tracker.

The outline of the design is described in the ATLAS Technical Design Report [2]. The present document provides the technical detail in the conceptual design level. The technical design report will be provided after the serious design work with manufacturing companies in a year or so.

### Basic Requirements

The solenoid must meet with various types of requirements. Followings are the major items to be well considered in the design as key points.

1. Central magnetic filed : The magnetic filed at the center is 2 Tesla. The filed is solenoidal and therefore axial symmetric. Since the iron yokes for magnetic flux return is apart from the coil end, the filed is not uniform along the beam axis. The field is axially symmetric within 1 % at z=0, except at the vicinity of the return power but at the top of solenoid.
2. Polarity of field: In order to check any front-back asymmetries of the ATLAS detector performance of, the polarity of the solenoid field can be switched. The time required for switch is one day.
3. Integration into the ATLAS detector system :The coil is to be installed in the space between the inner vacuum vessel and inner cold vessel of the barrel LAr cryostat.

4. Thinness of material :

In order to avoid appreciable degrad_tion of the energy measurement of electrons and gamma rays, total radiation thickness that particles has to penetrate before they reach the LAr EM calorimeter must be less than 3.5 X0 at any angle, except at several specific spots for coil supports.

5. Quench protection and recovery:

The coil locates in the vacuum vessel of the cryostat deep inside the detector system.

Therefore, any mechanical repair of the coil is almost impossible or may require a major disassembling of the ATLAS detector. Damages during operation mainly be caused by accidental quenches. The solenoid should be designed to minimize the frequency of quenches. But also it requires various safety systems to protect the coil and service line even in case of quench. The required recovery time after quench is 4 hours.

6. Mechanical support :

The supports of the coil carry the coil gravity weight as well as decentering magnetic forces, the latter being expected to be smaller due to relatively long distance to the magnetic return yoke. A safety factor at 3 is taken against G-loads for transportation and installation.

7. Alignment :

Due to non-uniform field, the magnetic center must be known within +-1cm along the beam axis. The position of the coil in the cryostat vacuum vessel moves when it is cooled.

Its length shrinks by 2 cm while its radius changes 0.5 cm. The coil supports are to be adjusted such that the cold coil position aims at the cryostat center.

8. Radiation tolerance :

Although the radiation level is rather low, the total accumulated dose reaches 50 kRad/year at the coil location. The main component of which is neutron of E > 100 keV and its fluence is around 10\({}^{13}\) neutrons/cm\({}^{2}\)/year. Total dose tolerance must be given in materials in use such as glues and sensors.

9. Liquid He supply and control:

The supply of Helium is from the ATLAS cryogenic system. The requirements on helium coolant, pressure, temperature should be fit with the ATLAS cryogenic system.

10.

10. Operation : The ATLAS experiment at LHC is expected to be operated for more than 10 years, possibly beyond 20 years depending on physics discoveries and LHC potentialities. Therefore, the solenoid, which is one of the major components of the apparatus, should be operated without any specific sl:ills or knowledge not only for steady state operation but also at the time of starting, ending and quenching. To accomplish this requirement, the operation should be fully automated by computer control. The cool-down and warm-up time should be long enough not to produce any appreciable strain in any components of the cold part. It is expected to be 5 days for cool-down or warm-up. Time for excitation and de-excitation to/from 8,000 A is less than 1 hour. The solenoid can only be excited when the barrel LAr calorimeter is in cold steady state.
11. Monitoring: Monitoring devices are to be equipped sufficiently enough to monitor the operational status of the solenoid at any time. Items to be monitored are temperature, stress, He flow, current and voltage. However theses devices should not be any cause of unstable operation. Remote monitoring by experts is to be set easily.
12. Safety code : For the possible excitation tests at KEK Japan, it is required to meet with the High-Pressure Gas Safety Regulation. After the coil is transported to CERN, the safety code of CERN will be applied.
13. Completion of construction: The coil must be ready for installation into the barrel LAr cryostat at a CERN surface building in January 2001.

### Magnetic field

Field uniformity and coil forces are strongly influenced by the tile-calorimeter elements. These effects were calculated in a series of axisymmetric finite element analyses using the ANSYS program. The configuration of iron and coil used in these calculations is based on the design as of May 1996 as shown in Fig.1.3.1. In the present calculation the calorimetry segmentation and slot structure were approximated as low density solid iron blocks that covers the same volume of the tile calorimeter. As seen in the figure stack factors are introduced to take non-magnetic components into account. This approximation therefore neglects the'smearing' of the B-H properties to account for the small volume of air in the calorimetry. Since return yokes are relatively far from the coil, this approximation does not introduce any appreciable errors.

Figs. 3.2-5 show the magnetic flux, contour of the total strength of the filed, contour of \(\rm B_{Z}\) and \(\rm B_{T}\), while \(\rm B_{Z}\) and \(\rm B_{T}\) are plotted as a function of z and r in Figs. 3.6 and 3.7. The relevant figure for momentum measurement is the field integrals over the track length inside the tracking volume,

\[I_{\rm t}=\int B\sin\theta_{(d\hat{\theta},\hat{\theta})}d\ell,\]

\[I_{\rm z}=\int\int B\sin\theta_{(d\hat{\theta},\hat{\theta})}d\ell dr.\]

Figs. 3.8 and 3.9 show these integrals as a function of pseudo-rapidity \(\eta\). The tracking volume is assumed to be 105.2 cm in radius and 258 cm in half-length. These integrals are compared with the ideal solenoid. The results are similar to an independent calculation by V. I. Klyukjin and B. I. Klochkov [3]. Fig. 3.10 shows the ratio of double field integral to that of ideal solenoidal field: \(\rm I_{2}\)(actual) / \(\rm I_{2}\)(ideal solenoid). The degradation in the tracking capability due to in-homogeneous solenoid field is 10.5 % only at high rapidity region. In the actual tracking, high precision tracking devices are concentrated in the central part of the volume, and thus the degradation due to field non-uniformity is smaller.

The expected magnetic field distribution is such that if the geometric center of the coil were located at the magnetic center of the hadron calorimeter, the coil would be in unstable equilibrium with no net electromagnetic body forces acting upon it. However, if the coil were displaced from its equilibrium position, forces would act upon the coil in such a way as to increase the displacement. The axial decentering force is calculated by perturbing the axial coil position (axial decentering). The radial decentering force requires a 3D magnetic simulation. For the time being, we deduce it by calculating the difference in radial force on the coil when the coil radius is varied. Fig. 3.11 shows the axial and radial decentering force as a function of coil displacement with respect to the tile calorimeter system. It is apparent that the axial decentering force is quite small for a few cm displacement. On the contrary, though the present estimate is indirectly done, the radial decentering force is appreciable and comparable with the gravity force on the cold mass.

## 2 Solenoid Design

### Design principles

In order to minimize the coil material while keeping the safety and reliability for operation, the following concepts are employed:

1. the stress of the coil materials does not exceed 75 MPa and the strain is kept less than 0.1 %,
2. the maximum temperature does not exceed 120 K in the worst case quench.

The first requirement keeps the materials within the elastic region, thus the mechanical properties will be safely reproduced after many operational cycles as well as number of thermal cycles. It can be realized without introducing additional materials by increasing the mechanical strength of the conductor. Traditionally pure aluminum has been used as a cladding stabilizer to attain the high limit on the disturbance energy, since required RRR (residual resistivity ratio) for stabilizer is over 500. However pure aluminum has a low yield point at the strain even at low temperature. Its contribution is rather small in supporting the electromagnetic forces. Since the aluminum stabilizer occupy relatively large portion of volume in the coil, it is very efficient in supporting the forces if the stabilizer could be strengthened. In the ATLAS solenoid design work, a design goal for the yield strength of the pure aluminum stabilizer has been set as 75 MPa. This is based on recent R&D work done at KEK on the prototype solenoid for the SDC project [8].

The second requirement avoids an excessive thermal stress in case of a quench. According to Fig. 2.1.1, which shows the thermal expansion of aluminum as a function of temperature, the temperature corresponding to the thermal expansion of 0.1 % with respect to the point for 4.5 K is 140 K. It is thus reasonable to set the maximum temperature rise of aluminum at 120 K including some contingency.

A useful parameter to gauge the relative transparency of the superconducting coils is the ratio of the stored magnetic energy E to the cold mass

\[\frac{E}{M}\equiv\frac{\mathit{Stored}\ \ \mathit{Energy}\ \left[\mathit{kJoule} \right]}{\mathit{Cold}\ \ \mathit{Mass}\ \left[\mathit{kg}\right]}\.\]

In the case of a solenoidal coil consisting of mechanically homogenous materials, this E/M ratio is directly related to the stress \(\sigma\) in the material,\[\frac{E}{M}\ =\ \frac{\sigma}{k\cdot\rho}\]

where the factor k is 2 for a coil with return yokes, while 3 for a long air-core solenoid, and p is the average density. Putting k = 3, p = 3.0 g/cm\({}^{2}\) and \(\sigma\) = 75 MPa, one gets

\[\frac{E}{M}\ =\ \frac{75\ [MPa]}{3\times 3.0\cdot 10^{3}\ [kg/m^{3}]}\ =\ 8.4\ kJ/kg\]

The E/M ratio is also directly related to the average coil temperature when the stored energy is dissipated entirely in the cold mass after a quench. The E/M ratio is approximately equal to the coil enthalpy at the coil temperature after the quench:

\[\frac{E}{M}\ =\ \left\{\begin{array}{l}C_{p}\ dt\ =\ H_{At}(T_{2})-H_{At}(T_{1})\ =\ H_{At}(T_{2})\end{array}\right.\]

where \(H_{At}\) is the enthalpy of aluminum, \(T_{1}\) is the initial coil temperature and \(T_{2}\) the average coil temperature after a quench. The equation assumes that all the stored energy is dumped uniformly into the cold mass by an accidental failure of the energy extraction mechanism. This corresponds to the worst case quench. The enthalpy of aluminum is plotted as a function of its temperature in Fig. 2.1.2. From this graph, one gets the relation

\[\frac{E}{M}\ =\ 10\ kJ/kg\ \ \ \ \Leftrightarrow\ \ \ \ T_{2}\ =\ 82\ \ K\]

In superconducting detector solenoids recently in use at various high energy physics laboratories, the E/M ratio is around or less than 5 kJ/kg, as shown in Fig. 2.1.3[14]. This value corresponds to \(\sigma\) = 41 MPa and T\({}_{2}\)= 65 K, which are appreciably less than the limits mentioned above, 75 MPa and 120 K, respectively. There is a room for improvement, namely increasing the E/M ratio, which reduces the thickness of the coil. We like to set our target E/M ratio at \(<\) 9 kJ/kg, taking possible non-homogeneous materials as well as non-uniform energy dump into account. As seen in the plot of the E/M ratio, we have achieved the E/M ration of 9.6 kJ/kg in the SDC prototype solenoid [8].

Above argument is based on the assumption that the quench propagation along the coil is fast enough to result in a homogeneous energy dump in the coil. A quench usually starts at some point and then propagates. If the quench propagates fast, the stored energy may be dumped uniformly. The quench propagation can be speeded up by attaching thin axial strips of pure aluminum (quench propagator) to the inner surface of the winding. The SDC prototype coil have demonstrated that the propagation speed was in fact increased by the pure Al-strip quench propagator [8].

Table 2-1-1 summarizes the parameters of the proposed ATLAS solenoid based on these design principles. Figs. 2.1.4 and 2.1.5 show the cross section views of the solenoid coil installed in the barrel LAr cryostat with relevant dimensions. Fig. 2.1.6 shows the cross section of the coil and associated objects at the center with their basic dimensions and locations. It also illustrates how the objects contract when they a.e cooled.

From 1990 till 1994, a prototype solenoid for the SDC collaboration of the SSC project was designed, constructed and tested at KEK. It was based on the same design principles mentioned above [4,5]. Table 2-1-2 lists up the major parameter of this prototype. In this document, many results from the excitation test of this prototype coil are quoted as verification of the principles.

In summary, we propose to set the E/M ratio as high as 8.4 kJ/kg to achieve the best coil transparency while keeping the long term stability as well as safety against quench. This could be realized

(1) by strengthening the aluminum stabilizer while keeping RRR at around 500,

(2) by introducing an axial pure-aluminum strips attached directly to the conductor.

The former keeps the mechanical strain at less than 0.1% at any spot of the coil, while the latter guarantees the maximum hot spot temperature less than 120K at the worst case quench.

### Coil design

1. Winding density n.:

The central magnetic field B\({}_{0}\) is given

\[B_{0}=2\ Tesla\ =\ \mu_{0}\cdot H=\ \mu_{0}\cdot n\cdot I\cdot\cos\theta\]

where \(\theta\) is the azimuthal angle of the coil end seen from the coil center. Assuming that the technically attainable current is 8 kA, the number of coil turns needed to achieve a central magnetic field of 2 T is 222 per meter, the conductor width being 4.5 mm including insulation.

2. Stored energy E.:

The total stored energy is given as

\[E\ =\ \frac{1}{2}\int\vec{H}\cdot\vec{B}d\nu\ =\ \frac{1}{2\mu_{0}}B_{0}^{2}\ \ V\ =\ 42\ \ MJoule\]

where V is the cylinder volume of the solenoid. This estimate is consistent with 42 MJoule calculated by FEA.

3. Coil thickness t.:

The effective cold mass is 5000 kg based on the proposed E/M ratio of 8.4 kJ/kg. The total thickness t of the cold mass is obtained by

\[\frac{E}{M}\ =\ 8.4\ \ kJ/kg\ =\ \frac{42\ MJoule}{2\pi\cdot r\cdot t\cdot l \cdot\rho}\]

where r = 1240 mm is the effective coil radius, l is the coil length and p = 3 g/cm\({}^{3}\) is the effective density of the coil. Then one obtains

\[t\ =\ \frac{42\cdot 10^{6}}{2\pi\times 1240\times 5300\times 3\times 8.4}\ =\ 41\ \ mm\]

for the coil thickness. The solenoid coil consists of a single layer coil wound with aluminum stabil: \(d\) superconductor and an outer support cylinder. The ratio of conductor to cylinder is chosen to be 28 mm to 12 mm to enable major energy dissipation into the conductor. This is to take into account a longer time constant of heat transfer from the conductor to the cylinder in higher temperature. Even if the whole energy is assumed to be dissipated only in the coil during a transient period of a quench, the E/M ratio will be 11.9 kJ/kg corresponding to \(\leq\) 90 K. Fig. 2.2.1 shows the proposed coil cross-section.

4. Hoop stress:

The radial hoop stress is supported by the combination of the conductor and support cylinder. The hoop stress which is maximum at the coil center is given by

\[\sigma_{hoop}\ =\ \frac{r\cdot P_{r}}{t}\ =\ \frac{1.24m\times 1.6MPa}{0.040m}\ \approx\ 50\ MPa\]

where t = 40 mm is the mechanically effective coil thickness and P\({}_{r}\) is the radial magnetic pressure given by

\[P_{r}\ =\ \frac{B_{z}^{2}}{2\mu_{0}}\ =\ 1.6\ \ MPa\]

with an approximation for a long 2 Tesla solenoid. The corresponding hoop strain is 0.07 %, indicating that the material is within elastic limit. A finite element analysis has been carried out to calculate this stress more precisely. Fig. 2.2.2 shows the hoop stress along z axis obtained by FEA.

5. Axial compressive force:

The axial compressive force F\({}_{Z}\) in a long solenoid is approximately

\[F_{z}\ =\ \frac{dE}{dz}\ =\ \frac{d}{dz}\Bigg{(}\frac{V\cdot B_{z}^{2}}{2\mu_{0 }}\ \approx\ \frac{S\cdot B_{z}^{2}}{2\mu_{0}}\ =\ 7.7\ \ MN\]

where E is the stored energy, z is the effective coil length, and S is the area of the effective magnetic aperture. The axial stress in the coil and support cylinder is approximately:

\[\sigma_{z}\ =\ \frac{F_{z}}{2\pi\cdot r\cdot t}\ =\ -25\ \ MPa\]

where the negative sign indicates a compressive stress, which is just one half of the hoop stress. Fig. 2.2.2 includes the axial stress by FEA.

6. Combined stress:

These two stresses will be combined and accumulated at the coil center. The maximum shear stress 2 \(\tau\) in the coil is given by:

\[2\tau=\big{(}\sigma_{1}-\sigma_{2}\big{)}+\big{(}\sigma_{2}-\sigma_{3}\big{)} +\big{(}\sigma_{3}-\sigma_{4}\big{)}\approx\big{(}\sigma_{hoop}-\sigma_{z} \big{)}\]

where \(\sigma_{1}\,\sigma_{2}\) and \(\sigma_{3}\) are general principal stress which are replaced by \(\sigma_{hoop}\) and \(\sigma_{Z}\) in the present case. The maximum shear stress 2t in the conductor is \[2\tau^{\rm max}=\sigma_{loop}^{\rm max}-\sigma_{t}^{\rm max}\ =\ 50+25\ =\ 75\ MPa\]

The yield limit \(\sigma_{0.2}\) of the conductor is expected to be larger than 2\(\tau\) = 75 MPa in order to keep a mechanically well controlled design.

7. Shear stress:

The shear stress at the epoxy bond between the coil and support cylinder is another important mechanical parameter. We may roughly estimate this shear stress in the most pessimistic case in a simple model. If the magnetic field at the coil end has only a radial component with a field intensity of 2 T, the estimated Lorentz force is

\[f_{t}\ =\ B_{r}\cdot I\ =\ 16,000\ \ N/m\]

We assume that this axial force is supported by the radial outer surface of the coil. Therefore, the approximate shear stress at the outer boundary is calculated by

\[\sigma_{shear}\ =\ \frac{f_{t}}{w_{t}}\ =\ 3.7\ MPa\]

where \(\rm w_{Z}=4.3\ mm\) is the axial width of the conductor. The actual shear stress will be smaller than that calculated with this simple and extreme method. Our FEA result shown in Fig. 2.2.3 in fact indicates the shear stress at the epoxy bond is 1.75 MPa or less. These numbers are at least four times smaller than the bonding shearing strength actually measured in various sample tests. Fig. 2.2.4 shows the sharing strength of the epoxy bonding between the conductor and support cylinder at two temperatures. These sample pieces were taken from the test winding and curing set of the SDC prototype coil [7].

Table 2-2-1 summarizes the yield strengths, analytical estimations, and the results from FEA.

8. Strain curve and coil deformation:

Fig. 2.2.5 shows the stress-strain curve of the superconductor with newly developed reinforced aluminum stabilizer. It shows a large improvement in its yield strength with respect to conventional conductor with pure aluminum even at the temperature of liquid helium. Fig. 2.2.6 shows the stress-strain curve of the coil with contribution by the support cylinder and the Al-stabilized conductor. It indicates that the strain will be near 0.1% at 2 Tesla. Fig. 2.2.7 shows the deformation of the coil by FEA simulation. One sees the strain level of less than 0.1 %. This is actually verified in the excitation test of the SDC prototype solenoid, as shown in Fig. 2.2.8, in which measured stress is plotted as a function of square of current.

In order to satisfy the design guideline of a maximum temperature less than 120 K after a quench, even in case of some failure of a protection circuit, the stored energy must be dumped as uniformly as possible in the coil. This is possible if the quench propagation is much faster than the power decay time during a quench. A technique to increase the quench propagation velocity is to use axial pure-aluminum strips. This idea was given rise to and experimentally verified in the development of a thin superconducting solenoid for a balloon experiment [9], and further demonstrated by the SDC prototype solenoid [8].

If an adiabatic condition is assumed, the longitudinal (along the conductor) quench propagation velocity \(\nu_{\phi}\) is

\[\nu_{\phi}\ =\ \frac{J}{\rho\ C}\ \sqrt{\frac{L_{0}T_{s}}{\left(T_{s}-T_{0} \right)}}\]

where J is the current density, r is the density, C is the volumetric specific heat, L0 is the Lorentz number, T\({}_{s}\) is the wavefront temperature and T0 is the initial operational temperature [10]. Putting numerical numbers, one gets \(\nu_{\phi}\) = 12 m/s. The transverse (axial ) quench velocity \(\nu_{z}\) may be written as

\[\nu_{z}\ =\ \left(\frac{k_{z}}{k_{\phi}}\right)^{\nu_{z}}\cdot\nu_{\phi}\]

where k\({}_{z}\) and k\({}_{\phi}\) are the effective thermal conductances of axial (transverse) and circumferential (longitudinal) directions, respectively. One sees that \(\nu_{z}\) may be enhanced by increasing the axial thermal conductance k\({}_{z}\). Normally, the axial thermal conductance is suppressed by the turn-to-turn electrical insulation made of Kapton or glass tape. A pure aluminum strip of 1 mm in thickness pasted inside the coil surface, as depicted in Fig. 2.2.9, serves to enhance the effective thermal conductance in the axial direction by bypassing the axial electrical insulation. As shown in Fig. 2.2.10, pure aluminum with RRR > 1000 is especially appropriate for this purpose due to its enhanced thermal conductivity around the temperature range in use. At 4.5 K, k\({}_{\phi}\) is about 1500 W/mK. With proposed strips, k\({}_{z}\) is estimated to be about 100 W/mK effectively with pure-aluminum strips, while it is 1 W/mK without. The ratio of quench propagation speeds \(\varepsilon\) = \(\nu_{z}\)/\(\nu_{\phi}\) is an order of 0.2 with pure Al strips, while \(\varepsilon\) = 0.01 without. One can expect the enhancement of transverse (axial) quench propagation by an order of magnitude accordingly.

10. Quench simulation:We have performed a quench simulation using "Quench" code. Fig. 2.2.11 shows the results after a quench for three values of the parameter \(\varepsilon\) at 0.01, 0.05 and 0.1. Quench tests with the SDC prototype had indicated the value of \(\varepsilon\) between 0.05 and 0.1. Thus the maximum temperature is expected to be around 90 K according to our simulation.

Fig. 2.2.12 shows a dependence on the dump resistance, 0.1, 0.05 and 0 \(\Omega\), corresponding to the energy extraction percentage of 95, 80 and 0%, respectively. In this simulation, \(\varepsilon\) is set to 0.05. This calculation tells that extraction of stored energy is quite effective in keeping the coil temperature low.

11. Grand insulation:

The electrical ground insulation between the coil and support cylinder consists of two layers of glass-upilex-glass as shown in Fig. 2.2.13. An electrical breakdown voltage of more than 2 kV is expected with an insulation thickness of < 0.5 mm.
