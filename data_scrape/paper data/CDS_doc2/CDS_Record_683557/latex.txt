**Abstract**

The optical properties of several types of polystyrene WLS fibers are compared. Fibers having different concentrations of UV absorber have been measured. Experimental results on the light yield and light transmission of these fibers are presented. A comparative study of those properties is done for Bicron, Kuraray and Pol.Hi.Tech fibers.

## 1 Introduction

A comparative study of the optical properties of different polystyrene WaveLength Shifter (WLS) fibers produced by Bicron, Kuraray and Pol.Hi.Tech, have been performed in order to optimize the performance of the TILECAL/ATLAS calorimeter. Systematic measurements of the fiber light output and transmission have been done as a function of UV absorber (UVA) concentration 1, see also [1]. The different types of fibers studied, the date of arrival at Lisbon and the UVA concentrations are shown in table 1.

Footnote 1: All measurements reported here were done in the beginning of 1995

The proposed ATLAS hadronic calorimeter for the barrel and extended barrel regions will use scintillating polystyrene tiles and WLS plastic fibers. The WLS fibers collect and transmit the light from the plastic scintillators to the photomultipliers (PMT's), see [2] and [3]. The light must travel down the fibers for more than one meter and fibers with goo d attenuation lengths as well as high light yield are necessary.

Furthermore, it has been shown in prior test beam results with either muons or pions impinging on the crack region between scintillators, that there is an enhancement of the calorimeter response by about a factor of 1.5 in this region [4], for fibers without UVA. This extra enhancement leads to non-uniformities across the calorimeter and should be minimized. It is known that charged particles hitting WLS bars [5] or WLS fibers [6] generate Cerenkov and/or scintillation light. So, to reduce this effect in the crack region of TILECAL, we have investigated the addition of small concentrations of UVA to the mixture used in commercial standard fibers.

In section 2 we give a brief description of the setup used and the measurement procedures. In section 3.1, the results on the integrated current measurements for fibers illuminated with a blue scintillator are presented. In section 3.2, the results of fibers excited directly with a \(\beta\)-source are shown. Finally, in section 4 we give a summary and some conclusions.

Experimental setup

The Bicron, Kuraray and Pol.Hi.Tech fibers tested are 200 cm long, polished at the end close to the PMT and the opposite end was painted black. Five fibers of each type have been measured.

Fibers are excited at different distances (\(x\)) from an EM19813KB bi-alkali photocathode photomultiplier using light from a TILECAL blue scintillator. The scintillator is excited by electrons from a \({}^{90}\)Sr \(\beta\)-source. In some of the measurements only the \(\beta\)-source was used to excite the light directly in the fiber. A light mixer and a black opaque film with a 2 mm slit are air coupled to the PMT, and the distance from the fiber end to the light mixer is 1.0 mm.

The 2 mm slit is used to avoid a cross talk between the light cone from adjacent fibers, this allow to measure more fibers without any need of opening the black-box, resulting in a fast and stable procedure for the comparative study of great number of fibers. The small drawback is that the attenuatiopn lenght for fibers with lenght \(\gtrsim\) 60 cm is overstimated, and if we compare single clad (SC) with double clad (DC) fibers the relative light output, qualitatively is the same, but quantitatively the light output of DC fibers is understimated for regions of the fibers \(\gtrsim\) 70 cm (distance from excitation point to the light mixer).

The PMT signal is read by a digital voltmeter and the data acquisition is made by a Macintosh equipped with a GPIB interface [7]. The position of the excitation source along the fiber is obtained from a stepping motor controller. The system was equipped with LABVIEW software, and is mechanicaly very similar to the system described in [8].

A comment must be made to understand the small discrepancy of values from 1 994 results [1] with the ones presented here. In 1994, the black opaque film in front of the light mixer, had a slit of 1 mm and the distance of the fibers to this film was 2 mm, while this year the slit is 2 mm wide and the distance of the fibers to this film was 1 mm. This makes the numerical aperture higher implying that the light output is higher (\(\sim\) 4.5 times), see table 10 comparing the values of \(I(140)\). Also the attenuation length is globally higher (\(\simeq\) 40 \(cm\)), compared with the 1994 results.

A reference fiber sitting in a fixed position inside the box is used to monitor the stability of these measurements. We estimate systematic errors of \(\lesssim\)2.5% [7] with a 2% (sigma) error on the light yield \(I_{0}\), and about 6% for the attenuation length.

Two BCF91A Bicron fibers are used as reference fibers and for comparison purposes. Tables 2 and 3 show the experimental results and fit parameters for the Bicron fibers. Ten runs were made with fibers illuminated with the TILECAL scintillator, and 6 runs with the fibers excited directly by the \({}^{90}\)Sr \(\beta\)-source. In Fig 1-top it is presented the light output (\(I(x)\)) for the BCF91A-Ref. 1 measured in 10 runs with scintillator, and it shows the stability of the measurements. The average light output of the two reference fibers was computed point by point (10 runs) and it is shown in Fig. 1-bottom. Run to run fluctuations were found to be \(\lesssim\)2% in the light output. Figure 2 shows the fiber to fiber fluctuations for five Kuraray Y11(200)MS fibers without UVA (fiber # 2 was not painted correctly at the end, so it gives a higher light output than th other ones).

## 3 Comparative results

The response of the fibers to the scintillator light (\(I(x)\)) as a function of the distance (\(x\)) from the excitation point to the PMT, can be fitted with the sum of two exponentials as follows:

\[I(x)=I_{01}\exp\left(-\frac{x}{L_{1}}\right)+\,I_{02}\exp\left(-\frac{x}{L_{2}}\right) \tag{1}\]

\(L_{1}\) - Short attenuation length (in cm).

\(L_{2}\) - Long attenuation length (in cm).

\(I_{0T}=\,I_{01}+\,I_{02}\) - Light yield at \(x\) = 0 cm.

All the data were fitted with Eq. 1 and the light yield and attenuation length parameters are used for comparison purposes.

Figs. 3 and 4 show the ratio of the signal for each typical fiber type normalized to the BCF9l A fiber as a function of \(x\), for the scintillator and electron responses, respectively. Figs. 5 and 6 show the signal output at \(x\) = 140 \(cm\) for each typical fiber type normalized to the BCF9l A fiber at the same \(x\), for the scintillator and electron responses, respectively.

### Measurements with TILECAL scintillator.

Kuraray fibers with different concentrations of UV absorber were measured using excitation light from the scintillator to study the effect of this parameter in the light yield and light transmission. The light output \(I(x)\) is shown in Fig. 7.

Experimental and fit results are shown in table 6. The extrapolated light yield at \(x\)=0 cm (\(I_{0T}\)), has a slight increase when UVA is added to the standard fiber and decreases slowly from 10.42 to 9.58 when the concentration of UVA increases from 30 to 1000 ppm. Fiber to fiber fluctuations are of the order of 4% in this parameter. The long attenuation length (\(L_{2}\)) decreases from 310 cm to 280 cm when UVA is added to the standard Y11(200)MS fiber. Fluctuations are of the order of \(\simeq 2.5\)% in the light output, except for the fibers without UVA. The light output increases slightly when UVA is added to the standard fiber. For the fibers with a high concentration of UVA (1 000 ppm), the light output is of the same order as for the ones without UVA.

From Pol.Hi.Tech we have different types of S048-100 fibers, as can be seen in table 8. It should be stressed that fibers N3, N4 and N5 were produced in 1995 and they have higher light output than the fibers produced in 1994. We will take S048-100-Lote 1 as the standard fiber. All the fiber types produced in 1994 have roughly the same \(I_{0T}\), and the addition of UVA does not make a decrease in this parameter, but \(L_{2}\) is about 60 cm smaller for fibers with Stabilizer or UVA compared with S048-Lote 1 fibers (see table 8). Fiber to fiber fluctuations are \(\lesssim 4\%\) for \(I_{0T}\) and \(\lesssim 5\%\) for \(L_{2}\). The new fibers from 1995 production (N3, N4 and N5), show a much higher light yield compared with 1994 fibers. The attenuation lenght is roughly the same, but with higher fiber to fiber fluctuations (10% for N3 and N4 fibers). The light output \(I(x)\) for these fibers is shown in Fig. 9. The light output at \(x=140\)\(cm\), for the S048-100-1 500ppm+Stabilizer fibers, is almost the same of the S048-Lote 1, and slightly higher than for S048-100-1000ppm+Stabilizer and S048-100 with UVA. The 1995 fibers have higher light output than the previous ones. The fiber to fiber fluctuations in the light output is \(\simeq 2\%\) for the 1994 fibers and \(\simeq 3\%\) for the 1995 fibers.

All the BC F99-28 Bicron fibers are from 1994 production except the ones with 60 and 300 ppm of UVA, which were produced in 1995. The addition of UVA to BC F99-28 fibers was studied in ref [1], and one of the conclusions was that a better compromise between high light output for scintillator response and supression for direct particle response could be achieved. For this purpose two new types of fibers have been measured with 60 and 300 ppm of UVA, along with the 1994 fibers. Figure 11 shows the light output for these fibers, and a summary of the results is given in table 11. The attenuation length \(L_{2}\) increases from 261 to 279 cm when 60 ppm of UVA is added to BC F99-28 fibers, but decreases with higher concentrations in agreement with the previous results. The light output \(I(140)\) decreases from 2.86 to 2.62 even for the smallest amount of UVA addition to the standard fiber. Fiber to fiber fluctuations are \(\lesssim 5\%\) for \(L_{2}\) and \(\lesssim 4\%\) for the light output.

### Measurements with electrons.

To study the reduction of light as a function of UVA concentration, the TILECAL scintillator was removed from the setup. In this way, the fibers were excited directly with electrons from the \({}^{90}\)Sr \(\beta\)-source.

Experimental and fit results are summarized in table 7 for Kuraray fibers, see also Fig. 8. When the UVA concentration increases from 0 to 1000 ppm, the extrapolated light yield \(I_{0T}\) decreases from 4.82 to 1.63, and the light output at \(x\)=140 cm decreases from 1.82 to 0.64. The long attenuation length \(L_{2}\) is rather independent of UVA concentration.

When UVA is added to the S048-100 fibers (Lote 1), the extrapolated light yield \(I_{0T}\) decreases from 8.11 to 2.21 and \(I(140)\) decreases from 3.02 to 0.80. \(L_{2}\) is roughly the same as the scintillator response for all fiber types, see table 9 and Fig. 10.

Also, as expected, the Bicron fibers with UVA have a decrease in the light yield \(I_{0T}\) from 8.56 to 0.94, and in the light output from 2.93 to 0.28 when the concentration of UVA increases from 0 to 20000ppm. On the other hand, \(L_{2}\) has roughly the same values and behaviour than the scintillator response up to 600 ppm of UVA. For higher concentrations (\(\geq\) 2500 _ppm_), \(L_{2}\) is roughly constant (\(L_{2}\simeq\) 200 _cm_), see table 12 and Fig. 12.

## 4 Summary

* The addition of a UV absorber to the standard fibers (BC F99-28, Y11(200)MS and S048-100) reduce the direct response to particles, absorbing part of the Cerenkov and/or scintillation light produced inside the fibers.
* Kururay fibers with UVA have roughly the same or higher light output than the corresponding fiber without UVA. A reduction of \(\simeq\) 65% in the light output at \(x=140\)_cm_ is achieved with 1000 ppm of UVA, when the fibers are excited with electrons. In Fig. 13 it is shown the ratio of \(I(140)\) of the fibers with UVA over \(I(140)\) of the fiber without UVA, as function of UVA concentration. The scintillator and electron responses are presented.
* Pol.Hi.Tech fiber with UVA (concentration not specified), has slightly lower light output than the fibers without UVA, when excited with scintillator. A reduction of \(\simeq\) 75% in light output at \(x=140\)_cm_ is obtained if we compare the fiber with UVA with the standard fiber, for excitation with electrons. It should be stressed that the response of S048 fibers without UVA to electrons is very high (as can be seen in fig 4 or 6), compared with the response of the Bicron and Kuraray fibers without UVA.
* The light output for Bicron fibers decreases with increasing UVA concentration for the scintillator response. For 600 ppm of UVA, \(I(140)\) decreases \(\simeq\) 25% with respect to fibers without UVA. A reduction of \(\simeq\) 80% in light output at \(x=140\)_cm_ is achieved with 600 ppm of UVA, when excited with electrons. In Fig. 14 it is shown the ratio of \(I(140)\) of the fibers with UVA over \(I(140)\) of the fiber without UVA, as function of UVA concentration. Scintillator and electron responses are presented.
* UV absorbers from Kuraray and Pol.Hi.Tech. are more effective then that from Bicron, since they managed to decrease the response to particles without a significant or no loss in the response to the scintillator. While the UV absorber from Bicron reduce the scintillator response even for small concentrations.
* Kuraray Y11(200)MS fibers shows the highest light output when excited with light from the scintillator. Pol.Hi.Tech S048-100 fibers from 1994, show the lowest light output, figs. 3 and 5.
* Pol.Hi.Tech. S048-100 fibers from 1995 production have higher light output than the fibers from 1994 production without decrease in attenuation lenght. S048-N4 has a response similar to the BCF91A.
* Fiber to fiber light output fluctuations are less than 2% for Kuraray and Pol.Hi.Tech 1994 fibers, while for Pol.Hi.Tech 1995 fibers it is slightly larger (\(\thicksim\) 3.5% ). For Bicron fibers this fluctuations are less than 4%.
* Fiber to fiber attenuation lenght fluctuations are less than 2.5% for Kuraray fibers, 5% for Pol.Hi.Tech 1994 fibers, and 10% for Pol.Hi.Tech 1995 fibers. For Bicron fibers this fluctuations are less than 5%.
