ABSTRACT

The behaviour of several double sided and one single sided detectors designed for analog readout electronics has been studied in the ATLAS irradiation program. Using both sides of a double sided detector allows for a rather unbiassed comparison of the n- and p-side readout. Very similar charge collection properties after irradiation have been found. Based on these measurements and extensive device simulations of both n\({}^{+}\)n baseline and p\({}^{+}\)n detectors a p\({}^{+}\)n detector concept and design has been optimized for binary readout. Measurement results from the irradiated analog readout detectors and extended device simulations for both the p\({}^{+}\)n and baseline n\({}^{+}\)n binary readout detector options are presented and interpreted to allow a judgement of the relative advantage of the two options. We come to the conclusion that the p\({}^{+}\)n option is expected to be at least equal and in safety aspects superior in its performance compared to the n\({}^{+}\)n option.

## 1 Introduction

The p\({}^{+}\)n detector concept for ATLAS has grown out of the development program of double sided detectors. It is based on the experience of the behaviour of several double sided detectors and one single sided p\({}^{+}\)n detector which were exposed to a fluence of approximately \(2\times 10^{14}\) 24 GeV protons/cm\({}^{2}\).

Emphasis in designing these detectors was put on simple cost effective production and protection of electrical breakdown both before and after irradiation. Punch through biasing was chosen as it leads to simplification in the production method. The use of guard ring structures [1] assures a gentle drop of the bias voltage towards the rim of the detector, thus protecting against electrical breakdown. These detectors were optimised for analog charge division readout and thus enhance charge division between neighbouring strips.

All detectors show stable current voltage behaviour up to high (\(>\)500V) bias voltage. However, after exposure to very high fluences (above \(1\cdot 10^{14}\)cm\({}^{-2}\)) an excess noise is observed which is produced by the punch through biasing circuit.

Based on the experience with present irradiated prototypes and on extended device simulations a new detector design of single sided p\({}^{+}\)n detectors has been developed. It is optimised for binary readout and adheres to the ATLAS barrel geometry. The only known serious problem of the tested detector prototypes, the observed excess noise, will be eliminated by replacing the punch-through biasing mechanism by resistive (polysilicon) biasing.

In the following the measurements on existing prototype detectors will be presented, followed by an explanation of the mechanism which is responsible for the survival of single sided p\({}^{+}\)n detectors after type inversion. The main part of the paper describes design and expected properties of a new \(p^{+}n\) detector prototype optimised for binary readout electronics.

## 2 Results from single sided p\({}^{+}\)n and double sided detector prototypes

The detectors were built on 280 \(\mu\)m thick 2-3 k\(\,\Omega\)cm n-type silicon. The 6\(\times\)6 cm\({}^{2}\) 112.5 \(\mu\)m pitch analog geometry with two intermediate floating (charge division) strips was chosen. They were irradiated at the CERN PS with 24 GeV protons up to a fluence of 2\(\cdot 10^{14}\) cm\({}^{-2}\). All of the detectors had the bias ring separated from the innermost guard ring. It was thus possible to observe separately the leakage current of the active detector region and the leakage current generated in the outside guard and cut region.

One of these detectors was a true single sided p\({}^{+}\)n detector with exactly the same geometry as the p-side of the double sided detectors but with unstructured n\({}^{+}\) backside.

**Current voltage characteristics**

All of the detectors behaved extremely well at all times during and after the irradiation, showing a saturation with bias voltage behaviour of the low leakage current compatible with expectations from radiation damage. The I-V characteristics of the single sided p\({}^{+}\)n detector measured at -10 \({}^{\circ}\)C is shown in figure 1. One notices an onset of the saturation at \(\approx\)100V and an edge leakage current of the order of below 10% of the current generated in the active region. A strong rise in edge leakage current, but no avalanche breakthrough, is observed at 530V. The leakage current voltage characteristics is also seen reproducible in diode test structures having the same guard ring structure and in double sided detectors with guard ring structures on the n-side bridged, so as to resemble the situation of a truly single sided p\({}^{+}\)n detector.

The temperature behaviour of the leakage current is shown in figures 2, 3 and 4. One observes a scaling of the leakage current with temperature which follows rather closely that of the intrinsic carrier density. This is true for both volume and edge generated currents.

**Capacitance measurements**

Capacitance measurements are a standard tool for determining the full depletion voltage of detectors. As for type inverted detectors the conductivity of the bulk material becomes rather low [2], these measurements have to be done at low frequencies. This is even more important when the measurements are performed at low temperatures and the carrier densities are strongly reduced, as was the case in the measurements to be presented below.

The bias voltage dependence at low temperature of the capacitance measurement of the irradiated single sided p\({}^{+}\)n detector is shown for various frequencies in figure 5. Based on this measurement a low frequency of 50 Hz has been chosen for the measurements of irradiated detectors.

The measurement of the unirradiated detector follows the expectation for a homogeneously doped detector (figure 6). This is not the case for the irradiated detectors exposed to a fluence of 2\(\times\)10\({}^{14}\)/cm\({}^{2}\) 24 GeV protons (figures 7 and 8). However this so far unexplained behaviour is well known and it has been experimentally confirmed that the full depletion voltage can be reliably extracted from these C-V measurements. One finds a full depletion voltage around 180 V for the 280 \(\mu\)m thick detectors, a value far above the saturation value of the volume generated current of approximately 100 V (figures 1 and 2). The fact that current saturation and full depletion occur at different voltages is also known since long time [6].

**Signal and noise measurements**

The signal properties before and after irradiation were investigated in a test setup allowing operation at low temperatures. One single readout board based on the FELIX readout chip was used to test all detectors under investigation. The FELIX chip can either be operated in 'peak mode' with peaking time of roughly 75 ns or in 'deconvoluted mode' corresponding to an effective peaking time of 25 ns. A strontium beta source was used to investigate charge collection properties.

In the following the results of signal and noise measurements are presented as function of the bias voltage. They are used to extract the charge collection efficiency for different detector types and operating conditions.

Signal clusters are reconstructed by requiring a'seed' with a pulse 4 times above the noise in the individual channel and including neighbouring strips if their signals are 2 times above their individual noise values. A cluster is accepted if it is larger than 5 times the average sigma. The noise values given are the average over strips.

Measurements are done at a temperature of -17\({}^{\circ}\)C. This low temperature was chosen in order to reduce the excess noise which is due to the chosen strip biassing technique. One double sided detector irradiated to high (2\(\cdot\)10\({}^{14}\)/cm\({}^{2}\)) fluence and one single sided p\({}^{+}\)n detector also irradiated at high fluence were investigated.

Signal and noise measurements in the FELIX peak mode (75 ns peaking time) of detectors irradiated to 2\(\cdot\)10\({}^{14}\)/cm\({}^{2}\) fluence are shown in figure 9. The signal of the single clusters and the average single strip noise is shown as function of the applied voltage. The signal is obtained by a Landau fit to the data. Data are presented for both sides of a double sided detector and for the single sided p\({}^{+}\)n detector. Noise values for all measurements are rather similar. For the double sided detector the signals of the two sides behave comparable after full depletion has

From the 1/C\({}^{2}\) distribution a full depletion voltage of 188V has been foundbeen reached. Well below depletion (below 80V) the signals on the n-side are higher than those on the p-side. The signals on the single sided detectors are overall somewhat higher. A possible explanation could be a difference in the detector thickness. For both detectors and both sides the cluster signal height saturates at approximately 180 V, in agreement with the capacitance measurements. With the 75 ns peaking time only a slight increase in signal height is observed after full depletion.

In figure 10 the same measurements are repeated but with the FELIX chip in deconvoluted mode (effective peaking time 25 ns). Due to the required precision of the timing signals in the deconvoluted mode the obtained Landau distribution is somewhat less clean. The p-side cluster signal height seems to be slightly smaller than the n-side. The single sided detector still gives larger signals than both sides of the double sided detector. Slightly higher saturation values for the cluster signal height (\(\approx\) 200 V) than in the peak mode is seen and the signal continues to grow somewhat steeper above full depletion. The latter is true for both sides of readout. The reason for this difference in behaviour (trapping?, ballistic loss?) will be investigated.

Another analysis using the same data but showing the mean cluster signal instead of the result of a Landau fit is presented in figure 11. Here one finds much smaller point to point scattering and consistent features. Particularly striking is the agreement (again with the exception at very low bias voltage) between n- and p-side readout in the deconvoluted mode.

**Signal cluster**

A argument put forward in favor of the n-side readout is the better behavior when operating in partially depleted mode. There a broader cluster is expected for the p-side than for the n-side. To study this effect the sum signal of the two central strips divided by the total signal in the cluster is plotted as function of the bias voltage (figure 12). One notes a faster drop of this ratio for the p-side than for the n-side both for 75ns (top plot) and 25ns (bottom plot) shaping time. However the effect is small (notice the zero suppressed vertical scale).

Survival after type inversion

The apparent survival of p\({}^{+}\)n detectors after type inversion has been a puzzle for quite some time, causing some uneasiness when considering their use in the LHC environment. Recently a very likely explanation of this effect has been proposed [4]. It is based on the observation that the undepleted region of type inverted silicon has low conductivity [2], while at the same time the space charge density is high, a fact which can be explained by the presence of deep level acceptor type defects [3].

A somewhat simplified explanation of the situation after type inversion is shown in figure 13. The heavily damaged and therefore conducting edge region connects the bottom n\({}^{+}\) layer with the top electron layer, induced by the positive oxide charge. Ignoring for the moment charge generation, the edge region is depleted simultaneously from top and bottom when a depletion voltage is applied to the diode, thus creating a potential valley in the edge region (fig. 13a). This potential valley is filled by holes created in the cut region (fig. 13b). The low density of holes in the neutral region of the valley, respectively the low conductance of the undepleted region, limits the edge generated current.

Figure 13: Hypothetical explanation for the survival of a simple p\({}^{+}\)n silicon diode detector after type inversion due to strong irradiation: a) partially depleted detector after type inversion, neglecting carrier generation in the cut region. b) Fully depleted detector with charge generation in the cut region. The potential valley at the rim is filled up with holes, the undepleted region acts as resistor limiting the edge leakage current.

Design of p\({}^{+}\)n barrel type detector

In contrast to the baseline n\({}^{+}\)n option, which requires a double sided technology (although only one side is used for readout), the p\({}^{+}\)n option is a genuine single sided option.

A detector has been designed which adheres to the official barrel geometry and is optimised for the baseline binary single strip threshold electronics. The design is based on the experience with irradiated prototypes and on extensive simulations.

The main changes from prototypes presented above are the

* topology optimisation for 80 \(\mu\)m pitch single threshold binary readout.
* replacement of punch through biasing by resistive biasing. Two versions of resistive biasing are investigated:
* biasing by polysilicon resistors
* biasing by implanted resistors While the first of these two options is widely used and can therefore be considered save and proven, the second version offers some simplification in technology and cost.

### Topological layout

As far as geometrical features as e.g. readout pitch, strip length and external connections (bond pads) are concerned, the baseline convention is followed. Also the'small strip **-** wide gap' topology is used in order to reduce the capacitance to a minimum.

In contrast to the n-side, p-side readout makes special isolation structures in between strips superfluous. The positive oxide charges in the interstrip region provide the isolation. Operating the detector in overbiassed condition, a significant potential difference develops between strip implant and electron layer. This potential difference is however limited by the flat band voltage of the 'MOS structure' in between strips [5]. This is in contrast to the n-side p-stop design in which the absence of such a limit, leads to higher electric fields and larger full depletion voltage of the detector.

The absence of an implanted isolation structure in between strips leads not only to simplification of technology and reduction of defects, but also to a decrease of strip to strip capacitance.

The principal geometrical parameters of the design are compiled in table 1.

### Expected performance

The performance expectations are extracted from the measurements of irradiated detectors and from extensive device simulations. These simulations were made for both baseline n\({}^{+}\)n detectors and for p\({}^{+}\)n detectors to allow a direct comparison of these options. The simulations take into account the known radiation induced changes in material properties as are

- effective doping changes

- oxide charge buildup

- very strong reduction of electrical conduction in the undepleted detector region

- mobility reduction in the surface region

Not taken into account are charge trapping and the subtle effect of non-inversion in the surface region of the detector.

To investigate the difference in potential and electric field configurations between p\({}^{+}\)n and baseline option the equipotential line plot is shown in figure 14 for strongly inverted detectors of either options. The chosen effective acceptor doping concentration leads to a depletion voltage of 350V (for a planar diode). The same bias voltage of 400 V is taken in both cases. One notices the much stronger potential drop in the interstrip region for the n\({}^{+}\)n option leading to higher electric field near the strip edge (at 11 and 69 \(m\)um on the horizontal scale) and to an increase of the full depletion voltage of roughly 50 V compared to the p\({}^{+}\)n option.

The difference in potential between strip implant and interstrip regions for heavily irradiated p\({}^{+}\)n and baseline detectors is shown in figure 15. Zero potential difference between strip metal and implant has been assumed. One notices again the significantly larger potential drop in the interstrip region for the baseline option resulting in higher electric field and correspondingly

larger probability of micro discharge as well as higher bias voltage needed for full depletion.

The main motivation for choosing n\({}^{+}\)n detectors as baseline is the expectation to be able to operate them partially depleted. Extensive simulations have been performed to investigate the difference in charge collection properties between p\({}^{+}\)n and baseline n\({}^{+}\)n detectors.

As an illustration for the simulation the distribution of holes very short time after the passage of a minimum ionising particle through the p\({}^{+}\)n detector is shown in figure 16. One notices the holes produced along the track and in the four p\({}^{+}\) doped strips in the back of the figure. The time development of the charge carrier distribution is followed so as to find the time dependence of the signals on the strips and on the backside of the device.

Figure 17 shows the time development of the signals on the two readout channels closest to the normal incident particle depositing a total charge of 3.2 fC. This is a track position in which one would expect to see a difference between the two options if it were present. One notices a somewhat faster rise of the signals in the baseline detector, however no significant difference of the signal height.

As the maximum operation voltage for the baseline option is 300 V the same plot is also shown for this under depleted situation in figure 18. Here one notices after the initial fast rise the extremely slow climbing to the full signal which is due to the low conductivity of the undepleted bulk region. The positive charge induced by the holes stopping at the boundary of the space charge region initially partially compensates the negative signal charge collected in the strips. This compensation slowly diminishes while the charge carriers in the undepleted regions readjust, so as to reduce the electric field in this region to zero.

Simulations of this type were made for various track positions, bias voltages and irradiation scenarios in order to be able to extract some global charge collection properties.

The two upper plots are for p-side readout, the lower ones for n-side readout.

as function of the relative track position for both p\({}^{+}\)n and n\({}^{+}\)n option, both operating at same bias of 400 V. One notices no significant difference between the two situations. However certain degradation is observed when using the bias voltage limit of 300 V for the n\({}^{+}\)n option.

In order to estimate the properties with the binary single strip threshold electronics the charge collected within 25 ns has been averaged over track positions. The average of the highest strip signal is shown in figure 20 both for p\({}^{+}\)n and n\({}^{+}\)n detector options. Very similar charge collection properties are seen for operation above full depletion as was the case in the measurements of irradiated detectors. Only below full depletion the (single strip) charge collection for p-side readout is significantly below that for n-side readout. No increase of simulated signal is seen with bias voltage raised significantly above full depletion. However charge trapping is not taken into account in the simulation and ballistic loss may be underestimated by time integration over 25 ns.

Shown is the charge collected within 25 ns in a single strip only for tracks of normal incidence generating 3.2 fC of primary ionization. The value averaged over the relative position within one strip pitch is taken.

Summary and conclusions

Using present knowledge, a comparison between the p\({}^{+}\)n and n\({}^{+}\)n detector options has been made. This knowledge is based on measurements of single and double sided detectors, irradiated in the ATLAS detector irradiation program of 1996 and on extensive device simulations for the detectors of both options planned for the detector development program in 1997.

That detectors can be built to operate reliably at significantly higher voltage than the baseline option (300V) is demonstrated by the irradiated single sided p\({}^{+}\)n and the double sided detectors used in the 1996 irradiation program. In these detectors, optimised for charge division readout, the occurrence of large electric field spikes is avoided.

This is also the case in the presently prototyped p\({}^{+}\)n binary readout detectors which, according to device simulations, show much lower voltage drop in the interstrip region than the n\({}^{+}\)n baseline option. The electric field spikes occuring at the strip edges and the probability of electric breakdown or microdischarges is strongly reduced and safe operation at higher bias voltage is possible. At and above full depletion operation, charge collection of p\({}^{+}\)n and n\({}^{+}\)n detector options is rather similar. Operation below depletion is possible for both detector options, however the signal drop with decreasing bias voltage is stronger for the p\({}^{+}\)n option.

We conclude that p\({}^{+}\)n detectors have similar performance as the baseline, when operated at or above full depletion and that partial depletion operation is possible for both options. With present fluence estimates the p\({}^{+}\)n detectors can be operated safely above full depletion.

The much simpler truly single sided process technology should result in higher yield and lower cost of the p\({}^{+}\)n option.
