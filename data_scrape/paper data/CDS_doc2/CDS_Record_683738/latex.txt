###### Abstract

We present a comparative analysis of heavy quark production mechanisms at high energies. The consideration includes perturbative chromodynamics in \(O(\alpha_{s}^{2})\) and \(O(\alpha_{s}^{3})\) orders, the phenomenological flavor excitation and parton showering mechanisms, and Semihard theory. In each case we compare the theoretical calculations with the Tevatron data, discuss the model uncertainties and judge the validity of the corresponding approach. Finally, we present the predictions on the production cross sections and the momentum distributions of heavy quarks and decay leptons for LHC conditions.

## 1 Introduction

The interest in understanding the heavy flavour production mechanisms comes from both theoretical and experimental sides. On the theoretical side, the production of heavy flavours in high energy hadron interactions is usually considered a powerful test of perturbative chromodynamics (pQCD) and related approaches. In the same time, as the practical applications are concerned, the estimations of \(b\)-quark production rates and kinematic distributions are necessary in providing future experiments aimed at the study of \(CP\)-violation, \(B^{0}\)-\(\kern 1.8pt\overline{\kern-1.8ptB}{}^{0}\) oscillations, rare decays, etc.

The theory of heavy flavour production is still not completed. In the last decade a considerable progress has been achieved in calculating the full next-to-leading order (NLO) matrix elements within perturbative QCD [1],[2],[3]. The contribution to the cross section from \(O(\alpha_{s}^{3})\) terms at collider energies appears to be roughly of the same size as born \(O(\alpha_{s}^{2})\) contribution. The question of the role of higher orders (NNLO) arises, but explicit calculations of these terms are hardly feasible because of great complications. Therefore, one can try to estimate the NNLO effects in an approximate or phenomenological way. A variety of such approaches will be considered in our paper.

The importance and the validity of the proposed models can only be tested via comparison with experimental results. The goal of the present paper is, first, to understand the lessons, which may be deduced from Tevatron data. Then we wish to extrapolate calculations to LHC energies and to make some predictions on the production cross sections and the momentum distributions of heavy hadrons.

The paper is organized as follows. A brief theoretical overview is presented in sect. 2. There, we also describe various production mechanisms, formulate three different models (paying attention to the possible danger of double counting), and discuss the origins and the sizes of theoretical uncertainties. In sect. 3 we perform a detailed comparison with the experimental results obtained by D0 and CDF collaborations at FNAL. Our analysis covers the production cross sections, the momentum distributions of heavy quarks and decay muons, and some kinds of two particle correlations. In sect. 4 we show the predictions made for LHC conditions. The concluding remarks are collected in sect. 5.

## 2 Theoretical overview

### Factorization as an overall principle

The starting point for the theoretical analysis lies in the fact that \(b\)-quark is heavy: \(m_{b}\simeq 5~{}GeV\). In addition, the experimental conditions usually imply kinematic cuts on transverse momentum; these, typically, are again in the vicinity of \(5~{}GeV\). This guarantees that the hadron interaction be harder than the essential parameters of strong forces, i.e. the QCD parameter \(\Lambda\) and the inverse colour confinement radius, and so the application of perturbative QCD methods is justified.

Apparently, it is a well formulated and clear theory, although in practice one would face the necessity to take into account a huge number of diagrams of great complexity, that makes the explicit calculations not possible. Therefore, we have to break the full picture into pieces and analyze them separately.

First, we select the 'hard skeleton' of the process, which is responsible for much of the energy-momentum flow. The rest is called'soft corrections'. The hard subprocess involves only a very limited number of particles (partons) and may be represented by a rather small number of Feynman diagrams. The selection of the hard parton subprocess is done in such a way that it could be calculated precisely, in a fixed order perturbation technique. On the contrary, the soft corrections may be composed of infinitely large numbers of diagrams and, therefore, need special methods of summation. The calculation of soft effects is only feasible within better or poorer approximations.

Here, in dividing the whole process into hard and soft pieces, we rely upon the factorization principle which tells that hard and soft processes do not mix. Thus, the cross section of any physical reaction may be represented as a product of independent factors: the hard parton cross section, the parton distribution functions, and the parton fragmentation functions. In its turn, the factorization principle is also a consequence of perturbative QCD.

In order to discriminate between hard and soft subprocesses, one has to introduce an artificial boundary. The corresponding parameters \(\mu_{R}\) and \(\mu_{F}\) appear in the arguments of the running coupling constant \(\alpha_{s}(\mu_{R}^{2}/\Lambda^{2})\) and the parton distribution functions \(F_{i}(x,\,\mu_{F}^{2})\). Here, the resummation of soft parton effects by means of renormalization Group equations or Parton Evolution equations up to the scales \(\mu_{R}\) and \(\mu_{F}\), respectively, results in the efficient scale dependence of of the quantities \(\alpha_{s}\) and \(F_{i}\). As the parameters \(\mu_{R}\) and \(\mu_{F}\) refer to different subsets of the resummed diagrams they must not be necessarily equal. We take them equal just for simplicity, \(\mu_{R}=\mu_{F}=\mu\), as is often done in the literature.

Both these parameters, \(\mu_{R}\) and \(\mu_{F}\) (or simply \(\mu\)), characterize the 'hardness' of the hard parton subprocess. The definition of the hardness is, however, rather uncertain. The fact that the process may be dominated by many diagrams of different topology causes ambiguities. Among the reasonable choices for \(\mu^{2}\) there are \(\mu^{2}=\hat{s}\), \(\min(-\hat{t},-\hat{u})\), \((\hat{s}\hat{t}\hat{u})^{1/3}\), \(m_{b}^{2}\), \(p_{\perp}^{2}+m_{b}^{2}\), and some other (here \(\hat{s}\), \(\hat{t}\), and \(\hat{u}\) are the usual Mandelstamm variables). Each of these different functional forms may be taken with a prefactor of the order of unity, say, ranging from \(1/4\) to \(4\). The numerical effects of this freedom will be considered in the next sections.

It is important to understand that the quantities \(\mu_{R}\) and \(\mu_{F}\) only represent a technical trick that enables us to go further in calculations. The dependence of the eventual results upon \(\mu\) is simply due to different treatment of hard and soft partons in the theory. As the relative role of hard and soft contributions may be rather different under different kinematic conditions (collision energy, cuts, etc.), a good fit to data obtained with any particular choice of \(\mu\) yet would not authorize us to always rely upon the same choice. The sensitivity of the eventual results to the choice of \(\mu\) reflects the inherent theoretical inaccuracy.

2.2 Phenomenology of lowest order subprocesses

Factorization into hard and soft contributions plays especially important role in phenomenology, being the guide to give the names to physical processes.

In the spirit of parton model a fast hadron may be considered a cloud of quasi-real partons. At each instant an individual parton may radiate another virtual parton, which, in turn, may radiate still another, thus initiating a virtual cascade, or a tree-like structure, composed of many subsequent branchings. This virtual cascade lives only a short time, which is allowed by the quantum mechanics uncertainty principle. A hard interaction with external particle destroys the quantum equilibrium [4] of the whole cascade and prevents its reassembling. The partons, which cannot reassemble back to the initiating parton, realize in the final state of the particle-particle collision.

Depending on the structure of hardest part in the parton cascade, the process may be called 'Flavour Creation' (fig. 1a), or 'Flavour Excitation' (fig. 1b), or 'Parton Showering' (fig. 1c). If to consider only second order hard blocks this exhausts all the possible physical situations, as the hard block may only contain two, or one, or none of the produced heavy quarks.

Flavour creation refers to the situation when the heavy quark pair appears in the hard interaction from the quark-quark annihilation \(q\bar{q}\to Q\bar{Q}\) or gluon-gluon fusion \(gg\to Q\bar{Q}\). The part of the graph shown in fig. 1a above the dash-dotted line corresponds to the \(2\to 2\) hard QCD matrix element, while the lowest part of this graph represents the evolution of gluon density.

Flavour excitation refers to the hard quark-quark \(q\,Q\to q\,Q\) or quark-gluon \(g\,Q\to gQ\) scattering, assuming that the heavy quark Q is virtually present in the sea in the initial particle. The subgraph shown in fig. 1b below the dash-dotted line describes the heavy quark content of the sea.

Finally, in the case of parton showers, the hardest \(2\to 2\) parton interaction involves only light quarks and gluons, while the appearance of heavy quarks is attributed to'soft physics' effects.

The above processes have a considerable overlap with explicit perturbation approach, as is explained in figs. 2 and 3. Concerning the flavor excitation, recall that heavy quarks may only be present in the sea as a result of gluon splitting. If to consider the gluon splitting as a part of perturbative subprocess and to combine the corresponding subgraph with the hard scattering diagrams (fig. 2a), one would obtain just the \(O(\alpha_{s}^{3})\) diagrams, which have been taken into account in the NLO calculations. However, the full \(O(\alpha_{s}^{3})\) set contains some diagrams (fig. 2b), which cannot be interpreted in terms of flavor excitation. It may then seem that the flavor excitation is totally contained in the NLO diagrams, but this is not true. There also exist higher-order diagrams (fig. 2c), which correspond to radiative corrections and which are not included in the \(O(\alpha_{s}^{3})\) matrix elements. Diagrams of this kind are present in the flavor excitation mechanism in the hidden form; they are efficiently taken into account as the QCD evolution of parton densities.

Similarly, the diagram shown in fig. 3a allows rightful interpretations either in terms of parton showering (i.e. gluon-gluon scattering \(gg\to gg\) followed by gluon splitting \(g\to Q\bar{Q}\)) or as an explicit \(O(\alpha_{s}^{3})\) subprocess. In the same time, there exist pure \(O(\alpha_{s}^{3})\) diagrams (fig. 3b), as well as the parton showering diagrams (fig. 3c) with formal perturbation order far beyond the \(O(\alpha_{s}^{3})\).

### Collinear versus noncollinear parton evolution

As it has been stated already, the theory treats hard and soft partons in different ways. the emission of hard partons is described in the fixed order perturbation technique, while the resummation of soft parton emission effects is done by means of parton evolution equations. The method to describe the soft parton emission effects is not unique, and at present, at least two types of parton evolution equations are known.

One of them is presented by the names of DGLAP [5] (Dokshitzer-Gribov-Lipatov-altarelli-Parisi) and corresponds to the so called collinear approximation. The partons are assumed to be massless and to move strictly along the hadron direction, with no transverse momentum. At a given probing scale \(\mu\), the parton distribution functions \(F_{i}(x,\,\mu^{2})\) depend on the longitudinal momentum fraction \(x\) only. The DGLAP resummation efficiently collects the terms of the type \([\alpha_{s}\ln(\mu^{2}/\Lambda^{2})]^{n}\) up to infinitely large \(n\).

Semihard theory [6]-[8] may be considered a generalization of conventional Parton Model which properly takes into account the transverse motion of the colliding partons. The origin of the parton transverse motion is explained in fig. 4, which provides a graphical representation of the evolution equations. In the course of parton splittings the average longitudinal momentum and energy decrease as they divide between daughter partons. At the same time, every splitting adds an arbitrarily oriented vector in the transverse momentum plane. After a sufficiently large number of splittings partons acquire a considerably large transverse momentum.

The ordinary \(x\)-dependent parton densities \(x\,F_{i}(x,\mu^{2})\) have to be replaced by full distributions \(\Phi_{i}(x,k_{\perp}^{2},\mu^{2})\), which determine the probability to find a parton of type \(i\) carrying the longitudinal momentum fraction \(x\) and transverse momentum \(k_{\perp}\) at the probing scale \(\mu^{2}\). The distributions \(\Phi_{i}(x,k_{\perp}^{2},\mu^{2})\) obey the BFKL [9] (Balitzkij-Fadin-Kuraev-Lipatov) equation and reduce to conventional parton model densities once the \(k_{\perp}\) dependence is integrated out: 1

Footnote 1: For this reason, the DGLAP parton functions \(F_{i}(x,\mu^{2})\) are often called ‘integrated’, while the BFKL functions \(\Phi_{i}(x,k_{\perp}^{2},\mu^{2})\) are ‘nonintegrated’.

\[\int_{0}^{\mu^{2}}\,\Phi_{i}(x,k_{\perp}^{2},\mu^{2})\,dk_{\perp}^{2}=x\,F_{i} (x,\mu^{2}). \tag{1}\]

The BFKL resummation efficiently collects the terms of the type \([\alpha_{s}\ln(1/x)]^{n}\) and \([\alpha_{s}\ln(\mu^{2}/\Lambda^{2})\ln(1/x)]^{n}\) up to infinitely large \(n\).

The specific properties of semihard theory may manifest in several ways. First, it is the additional contribution to the cross sections due to the integration over the \(k_{\perp}^{2}\) region above \(\mu^{2}\). Second, is a purely kinematic effect due to extra transverse momentum of the initial partons. Finally, the interacting partons in the semihard theory are not on mass shell, but are characterized by virtual masses proportional to their transverse momenta: \(m^{2}=-k_{\perp}^{2}/(1-x)\). This also implies a modification of the spin density matrices. In particular, the polarization vector of a gluon is no longer purely transversal, but acquires an admixture of longitudinal and time-like components. The latter property may have direct influence on the parton interaction matrix elements.

### Different models and their uncertainties

The necessity to introduce different models comes from the fact that the effects of'soft physics' cannot be described in a unique way and leave a great piece of freedom. In the same time, they may be numerically large and important. The relevant theoretical freedom may be summarized in several models known in the literature. In the present study, we have used three of them taken as representative examples of different theoretical ideas. The conventional names for them are 'Perturbative QCD', 'Semihard Approach', and 'PYTHIA'.

#### 2.4.1 Perturbative QCD

The approach based on purely perturbative treatment of QCD is described in [3]. It includes full born \(O(\alpha_{s}^{2})\) and NLO \(O(\alpha_{s}^{3})\) calculations. The theoretical uncertainties are connected with the numerical values of input parameters. In particular, one can vary the \(b\)-quark mass in the range \(4.5<m_{b}<5.1\ GeV\), and also the QCD parameter \(\Lambda\) in the running coupling constant: \(100<\Lambda<200\ MeV\). As well, one meets a considerable freedom in the definition of the renormalization scale \(\mu_{R}\), which enters the strong coupling constant \(\alpha_{s}(\mu_{R}^{2}/\Lambda^{2})\), and the factorization scale \(\mu_{F}\), which enters the parton distribution functions \(F(x,\mu_{F}^{2})\). Both these parameters characterize the typical interaction hardness. For simplicity, we take them equal, \(\mu_{F}=\mu_{R}=\mu\), as is often done in the literature, although it is not strictly obligatory to do so.

The parton distribution functions were taken from the standard PDF sets. All the parameterizations presented there are obtained from global fits to the experimental data using the collinear (DGLAP) type of the evolution equations.

In order to avoid double counting, the phenomenological mechanisms, such as the flavor excitation and parton showering, have not been included in this model because of their significant overlap with explicit \(O(\alpha_{s}^{3})\) terms.

#### 2.4.2 Semihard approach

The second model is based upon the semihard theory [4]-[8]. Here we only include the leading order matrix elements for the gluon-gluon fusion. However, the structure of these matrix elements is different from the LO matrix elements implemented in the first model (pQCD), because the initial gluons are now off mass shell.

Another essential ingredient is the gluon distribution function. The question of parameterizing the parton distributions \(\Phi_{i}(x,k_{\perp}^{2},\mu^{2})\) remains yet open because an appropriate analysis of the experimental data has never been carried out. For the present purposes, we find it reasonable to follow the prescriptions of paper [11]. The proposed method lies upon a straightforward perturbative solution of the BFKL equation where the collinear gluon density \(x\,G(x,\mu^{2})\) is used as the boundary condition. Technically, the noncollinear gluon density is calculated as a convolution of collinear gluon density with universal weight factors [11]:

\[\Phi_{g}(x,k_{\perp}^{2},\mu^{2})=\int_{x}^{1}{\cal G}(\eta,k_{\perp}^{2},\mu ^{2})\,\frac{x}{\eta}\,G(\frac{x}{\eta},\mu^{2})\;d\eta, \tag{2}\]

\[{\cal G}(\eta,k_{\perp}^{2},\mu^{2})=\frac{\vec{\alpha}_{s}}{xk_{\perp}^{2}} \,J_{0}(2\sqrt{\vec{\alpha}_{s}\ln(1/\eta)\ln(\mu^{2}/k_{\perp}^{2})}),\qquad k _{\perp}^{2}<\mu^{2}, \tag{3}\]

\[{\cal G}(\eta,k_{\perp}^{2},\mu^{2})=\frac{\vec{\alpha}_{s}}{xk_{\perp}^{2}} \,I_{0}(2\sqrt{\vec{\alpha}_{s}\ln(1/\eta)\ln(k_{\perp}^{2}/\mu^{2})}),\qquad k _{\perp}^{2}>\mu^{2}, \tag{4}\]

where \(J_{0}\) and \(I_{0}\) stand for Bessel functions (of real and imaginary arguments, respectively), and \(\vec{\alpha}_{s}=\alpha_{s}/3\pi\). This automatically fulfills the condition (1), guarantees the validity of BFKL evolution, and conveniently provides a common smooth parameterization for the whole range of \(k_{\perp}\) without any extra parameters taken from outside. The described method has been implemented in our simulations with the GRV structure functions set [10] taken for the input collinear densities. Our scheme is more accurate than that used in refs. [12, 13], which are also concerned to the production of heavy flavours at collider energies.

The uncertainties connected to the quark mass value \(m_{b}\) and the choice of the factorization/renormalization scale \(\mu\) are also present in this model.

#### 2.4.3 Pythia

The third approach is represented by PYTHIA [14] and includes the lowest order Flavour Creation, Flavour Excitation, and Parton Showering mechanisms according to the scheme explained in section 2.2. The last two mechanisms give phenomenological access to higher order contributions, beyond the \(O(\alpha_{s}^{3})\) matrix elements.

With respect to parton evolution properties, PYTHIA is organized as a mixture of different theoretical approaches. It uses the collinear parameterization of structure functions but gives intrinsic transverse momentum to the incoming partons. This \(k_{\perp}\) results from soft parton radiation as it is implemented in the PYTHIA's parton showering algorithm. It also uses the on shell matrix elements for the hard parton subprocesses, but, afterwards, it makes the partons off shell just to enable them to initiate showers. The virtuality of every parton is taken a random number ranging from \(Q^{2}_{\rm min}\) to \(Q^{2}_{\rm max}\). Here, \(Q^{2}_{\rm min}\) is an arbitrary small number (of the order of \(1\ GeV\)), and the value of \(Q^{2}_{\rm max}\) is determined by the virtuality of the parent parton. For the partons participating in the hard subprocess this quantity is defined as \(Q^{2}_{\rm max}=4p^{2}_{\perp\mbox{hard}}\).

From the academic point of view, PYTHIA is not a self consistent theoretical model, because one even does not know what the evolution equation exactly is. For example, one cannot say that the terms of the order \([\alpha_{s}\ln(\mu^{2}/\Lambda^{2})]^{n}\) are collected and those of \([\alpha_{s}\ln(1/x)]^{n}\) are neglected (or vice versa), and so one cannot keep the theoretical accuracy under control. However, PYTHIA provides a useful phenomenological framework that can be used to describe the experimental data if to properly adjust the model parameters.

For the case of heavy flavour production, the relevant parameters are the following. First, it is the heavy quark mass \(m_{b}\) and the usual factorization/renormalization scale parameter \(\mu\). These ones affect all PYTHIA's contributions that we have taken into account. The parameter \(Q^{2}_{\rm max}\) is specific for the parton showering. The influence of this parameter on the production rate is straightforward: being the maximal allowed gluon virtuality, it actually determines the available phase space for the gluon splitting \(g\to Q\bar{Q}\). Finally, the bottom quark contents of the sea affects the contribution from flavor excitation subprocess. Unfortunately, the estimations of heavy quark densities in a proton are rather uncertain. Heavy quark distribution functions have never been directly measured in any experiment, 2 but are only deduced from the light quark distributions on the basis of the evolution equations. Different parameterizations of heavy quark structure functions (cf. LO versus NLO GRV [10], CTEQ [19]) vary within a factor of 2 or 3.

Footnote 2: The only known results on this topic come from HERA where the charm contribution to the proton structure function \(F_{2}(cc)\) has recently been measured [H1 notes H1-5/96-480, H1-11/96-502, DESY preprint DESY 97-089]. However, this does not actually mean measuring the charm sea, because the production mechanisms were not separated. It is rather a presentation of the charm production cross section, which is mainly due to the photon gluon fusion, in the form of the proton structure function. By far, there are no data on beauty sea.

## 3 Comparison to Fermilab data

There are two kind of data available [15]-[18]: the single inclusive distributions and two particle correlations. In both cases the shape and the absolute cross section are under the test by the theoretical models. The results of our simulations using the Born+NLO QCD, PYTHIA and semihard approach are presented in figs. 5-8, together with the data obtained by the experimental collaborations CDF and D0.

The integrated \(b\)-quark inclusive production cross section (Fig.5) has been obtained by CDF and D0 collaborations from measured inclusive (mostly muonic) transverse momenta distributions. The necessary kinematic relation between the b-quark and daughter muon momenta has been predicted by ISA JET simulations or estimated from the measured transverse momenta of muons relative to jet axis.

The solid and dashed curves correspond to Born+NLO QCD and PYTHIA predictions, respectively, with CTEQ [19] structure functions, \(\Lambda=140~{}MeV\), \(\mu^{2}=m_{b}^{2}+p_{\perp b}^{2}\), and \(m_{b}=5.0~{}GeV\). The dash-dotted curve corresponds to semihard theory with \(k_{\perp}\)-dependent gluon distribution function generated (evolved) from GRV set [10] by means of method [11]. To calculate muon spectra from \(b\)-quark spectra within perturbative and semihard approaches we first evolve \(b\) quark into a \(B\) hadron using the Peterson's fragmentation function [20] with \(\varepsilon=0.006\) and then simulate its semileptonic decay according to the standard electroweak theory.

With the given choice of model parameters, PYTHIA agrees with the experimental cross section without any normalizing corrections. To provide a cleaner comparison between the theoretical models we have adopted the same parameters for perturbative QCD and semihard theory too, although the chosen \(b\) quark mass value is a bit higher than that quoted in the original paper [3]: \(m_{b}=4.75~{}GeV\). The perturbative QCD predictions appear to lie at approximately a factor of 2.5 below the data. However, this fact does not mean any kind of contradiction. Some reasonable variations in \(\Lambda\) and in \(\mu^{2}\), \(100<\Lambda<200~{}MeV\), \(\mu_{0}^{2}/2<\mu^{2}<2\mu_{0}^{2}\), with \(\mu_{0}^{2}=m_{b}^{2}+p_{\perp b}^{2}\), change the cross section estimations by a factor of 2. A reduction of the quark mass down to \(m_{b}=4.5~{}GeV\), which is a still acceptable value, would further enlarge the cross section by a factor of 1.4, thus completely eliminating the visible discrepancy. On the other hand, the initial underestimation of the production cross section might be interpreted as a room for higher order corrections. The sensitivity of the production cross section to the choice of structure functions is much weaker and only can alter the theoretical estimations within a few percent range. Semihard theory also shows reasonable agreement with the experimental results. It should be noted however that integral characteristics like the total cross sections are insensitive to many essential details of the real physical systems and are in this respect only poorly informative.

A similar agreement is observed in inclusive single particle distributions. Figs. 6a and 6b display the muon transverse momentum spectra in the central and forward rapidity regions, respectively. The muon distributions predicted by PYTHIA, perturbative QCD and semihard theory are similar in shape and only differ in the total normalization. The shapes of all the theoretical curves fit in with the experimental results equally well. The models slightly underestimate the absolute rates, but the size of discrepancy does not exceed theoretical uncertainties.

### 3.2 Two particle correlations

While all the three considered models predict rather similar inclusive single particle spectra, they possess different behavior in two particle correlations. The available experimental data obtained by CDF and D0 collaborations are the azimuthal angle difference distributions, either for two oppositely charged muons (coming from \(B\) and \(\vec{B}\) meson decays), \(d\sigma/d\Delta\phi_{\mu\mu}\) (fig. 7), or for the difference between the directions of a \(b\)-jet and an isolated muon (coming from another \(B\) hadron), \(d\sigma/d\Delta\phi_{\mu b_{jet}}\) (fig. 8).

Both experimental distributions are evidently dominated by the events when b and \(\overline{\rm b}\) quarks are produced back-to back or close to it. The calculations based on PYTHIA lead to an apparently too flat distribution, which does not fit in with sharply peaking experimental spectrum. The behavior of perturbative QCD appears to be even more steep than the data. Semihard theory lies somewhere in between the two above models, but the agreement with experiment can neither be considered very good.

A specific cut on the invariant mass \(M_{\mu\mu}>6~{}GeV\) in two muon correlations suppresses the events in which \(b\) quarks move close to each other. This cut was introduced to reject muons coming from cascade decays \(b\to c\mu\nu\), \(c\rightarrow\mu\nu X\). In the absence of such a restriction, all the models exhibit an increasing cross section at \(\Delta\phi_{\mu\mu}\simeq 0\). The strength of this maximum is different in different models (fig. 7b), but the experimentally observed distribution remains indistinctive with respect to this feature.

The experimental distribution \(d\sigma/d\Delta\phi_{\mu b_{jet}}\) in fig. 8a was obtained by CDF using the necessary isolation cut, requiring \(\sqrt{\Delta\phi^{2}+\Delta\eta^{2}}>1\), where \(\Delta\phi\) and \(\Delta\eta\) are the azimuthal angle and the pseudorapidity differences between the muon and \(b\)-jet, respectively [18]. This cut affected the leftmost three experimental points. A correction for this cut has been done, however it was model dependent. (The model used in [18] was perturbative QCD). The other points remain unaffected and can be used as an independent model test.

To achieve consistency with the published distribution \(d\sigma/d\Delta\phi_{\mu b_{jet}}\) we weighted each simulated event with the probability (taken from [21] ), that b-quark would give a jet with \(E_{\perp}>10~{}GeV\), where \(E_{\perp}\) is the transverse energy released in CDF calorimeter.

Variations in numerical values of \(m_{b}\), \(\mu^{2}\), and \(\Lambda\) may affect the total normalization and, to a less extent, transverse momentum distributions but not the angular correlations. The latter are determined by the properties of the involved parton subprocesses. Therefore, it is meaningful to separately analyze the shapes of individual contributions (fig. 8b). Gluon gluon fusion \(g+g\to b+\overline{b}\) has the most pronounced maximum at \(\Delta\phi_{\mu b}=\pi\) due to its inherent back-to-back kinematics. The contributions from quark gluon scattering (including the Flavour excitation \(g+b\to g+b\)) and gluon gluon scattering (\(g+g\to g+g\) followed by gluon splitting \(g\to b+\overline{b}\)) are rather flat.

The shapes of the latter contributions may be qualitatively understood as follows. In the Flavour excitation, one of the quarks experiences hard scattering, while the other (the spectator) moves along the proton direction and obtains its transverse momentum due to final state radiation. Since these two origins of transverse momentum are independent there should be no correlation between the quarks, and so the distribution over the azimuthal angle difference must be flat.

In the case of gluon splitting, one could apparently expect the both quarks to move together, following the parent gluon. In fact, this primordial topology is somehow distorted by the kinematic tricks made by PYTHIA. At the stage of hard interaction, PYTHIA assumes all the partons massless. Then, to enable gluons to split into heavy quark pairs it gives them arbitrary virtual masses. At every step PYTHIA observes conservation laws. Therefore, if some energy is spent to create a massive gluon from a massless one, the kinetic energy of this gluon has to be reduced, and the event configuration to be rearranged. The correlations between the produced quarks further decrease in the course of final state parton radiation.

The results of the comparison with experimental data give reasons to think that PYTHIA tends to overestimate the production rates in the flavor excitation and parton showering channels. On the other hand, the full neglect of such mechanisms in the approach based on fixed order perturbative QCD calculations does not yield much better results.

In the case of semihard theory, the effects of higher order terms resummation are absorbed into generalized gluon distribution functions. The agreement with the experiment is still not perfect. Probably, it could be improved if to use a more accurate parameterization for gluon densities. The latter issue has certainly acquired insufficient attention, as only a very few publications [12, 13], refer directly to experimentally studied processes.

## 4 Extrapolation to LHC conditions

### Particle distributions in different models

The theoretical results obtained for LHC energies are shown in figs. 9-12. They are presented in terms of the same kinematic variables as those applied to Fermilab case, but with cuts relevant to the conditions of ATLAS experiment. Only simple cuts have been taken: muons coming from B-hadron decays were required to have moment a perpendicular to the beam \(p_{\perp}(\mu)>6\;GeV\) and pseudorapidities \(|\eta(\mu)|<2.5\). A simple transportation of Fermilab cuts to ATLAS conditions would be physically meaningless, because of different experimental performance.

The production rates predicted by PYTHIA are above those of perturbative QCD by a factor of \(\simeq 3.5\), which is to be compared with \(\simeq 2.5\) at FNAL energies. The increase in the PYTHIA to QCD ratio is mainly due to the rapidly growing contributions from the flavour excitation and parton showering subprocesses.

Apart from the difference in the total normalization, the inclusive single particle spectra look rather similar (figs. 9,10). There are also some common features in the azimuthal angle correlations (fig. 11). All the models show a strong peak at \(\Delta\phi_{\mu\mu}=\pi\) and a weaker but clearly pronounced peak at \(\Delta\phi_{\mu\mu}\simeq 0\). The deviations from the ideal back-to-back configurations in the azimuthal angle are due to different mechanisms in different models. In perturbative QCD, it is the emission of hard parton. In PYTHIA, it is an accumulated effect of multiple soft radiation (parton showers). In semihard approach, it is the intrinsic transverse motion of the incoming partons. Roughly speaking, all these mechanisms may be said to more or less imitate each other.

The similarity is, however, only approximate, and is rather qualitative than quantitative. The contributions from flavour excitation and parton showeringmechanisms (fig. 11b) in PYTHIA lead to flattening of the overall angular distribution, and the discrepancy between PYTHIA and perturbative QCD becomes much stronger than at Fermilab energies.

The difference between the different production mechanisms may be most clearly seen in the quark pair rapidity distribution \(y_{b\overline{b}}\) for the events with \(\Delta\phi_{b\overline{b}}\simeq 0\). (We mind the rapidity of the quark pair as a whole). The oppositely caved shapes of the distributions predicted within NLO QCD and semihard approach are well recognizable in fig. 13a. In perturbative QCD, the \(\Delta\phi_{b\overline{b}}\simeq 0\) configurations are dominated by the diagram shown in fig. 4a. The gluon-gluon scattering probability is maximal when the scattered gluon moves forward or backward close to the beam axis. Consequently, the \(b\overline{b}\) pair produced from this gluon also moves predominantly in the forward or backward direction, and its rapidity is either large positive or large negative. On the contrary, in semihard approach, where only leading order matrix elements are included, the quarks are produced back-to-back in the gluon-gluon fusion c.m.s., i.e. with large opening angle. They only seem to be close in the projection onto the azimuthal plane, as a result of significant transverse boost of the gluon-gluon system. The longitudinal momenta of these quarks partly cancel each other, and so the pair rapidity \(Y_{b\overline{b}}\) concentrates in the central region.

### Uncertainties due to structure functions

To estimate the sensitivity of the results to the structure functions, we have compared the muon transverse momentum distributions calculated with EHLQ and CTEQ sets. These sets may be taken as representative examples from the pre-HERA and HERA history. The former and the latter sets are based on the experimental measurements in the region of \(x>10^{-2}\) and \(x>10^{-4}\), respectively. These sets approximately coincide at \(x>10^{-2}\) and deviate sensibly only at \(x<10^{-4}\). Although the beam energy at the LHC collider is large, the kinematical conditions of the ATLAS experiment restrict the \(b\)-quark production to the domain \(x>10^{-4}\) with the most typical \(x\) value of about \(10^{-3}\). There, the behaviour of different structure functions is rather similar. In fact, the difference between the integrated muon spectra does not exceed 20% (see fig. 12a). The largest changes concern the flavour excitation subprocess (see fig. 12b), because the beauty sea is the most poorly known and greatly fluctuates from one structure function set to another. We have intentionally chosen the EHLQ set for comparison, as it previously was the ATLAS 'default'. At the present time, this set is considered obsolete. The use of only modern sets based on HERA measurements leads to rather stable predictions deviating from each other by a few percent only.

## 5 Conclusions

We have compared three models conventionally named 'Perturbative QCD', 'Semihard Approach', and 'PYTHIA'. All of them are built on the grounds of perturbation theory and only differ in the manner they treat soft or higher order effects.

PYTHIA differs from perturbative QCD in the border between 'hard' and'soft'physics. While the hard sector in perturbative model includes \(O(\alpha_{s}^{2})\) and \(O(\alpha_{s}^{3})\) contributions, there are only \(O(\alpha_{s}^{2})\,\)ones in PYTHIA. Instead, PYTHIA has richer soft sector: it allows the production of heavy quarks in the flavour excitation and parton showering processes. Semihard approach differs from the both models by the parton evolution equations (i.e., Noncollinear BFKL scheme versus collinear DGLAP scheme). Also, it uses the off-shell matrix elements for hard parton interactions.

The models have been tested by confronting them with the available Fermilab data. As to the inclusive single particle spectra, all the models succeed in reproducing the experimental data equally well. The observed discrepancies concern mainly the total normalization and may be rather easily figured out, since a considerable freedom is allowed in the choice of model parameters (\(m_{b},\;\;\mu^{2},\;\;\Lambda\)). In the particular simulations we have used the set favorable for PYTHIA, so that it could fit the data without normalizing corrections.

The results on two particle correlations, such as the distributions on the azimuthal angle difference, are much more distinctive. All the models exhibit an increase in the cross section at \(\Delta\phi_{\mu\mu}\simeq 0\), but the strength of this maximum is different in different models (fig. 7). Unfortunately, the specific cut on two muon invariant mass in D0 experiment suppress the events of relevant kinematics. Also, the muon \(b\)-jet data sample obtained by CDF in this kinematic region is influenced by the experimental cut, which has been corrected in a model dependent way.

The difference between the different theoretical approaches is, as well, clearly visible in the domain where the experimental data are reliable with respect to both statistical and systematical errors. In all the cases the agreement may be characterized as qualitative rather than quantitative, and cannot be improved by normalizing rescaling. However, none of the examined theoretical models can be definitively ruled out. The available experimental data do not provide a clear indication to prefer any of the three considered theories.

The question of the way to include higher order perturbative corrections or nonperturbative production mechanisms remains open.

As the energy rises, the role of higher order contributions becomes more important. This may be seen in the \(\sigma_{NLO}(b\overline{b})/\sigma_{LO}(b\overline{b})\) ratio, which approaches \(\simeq 1.2\) at LHC energies (compared to \(\simeq 1.0\) at FNAL). The fact that Next-to-leading order terms dominate over the Leading order ones makes it doubtful to rely upon a purely perturbative scheme which is usually limited by the account of only few (two) lowest orders. An exception may be made for specially selected kinematic domains, such as the ones determined by the high \(p\hskip-5.0pt/\;\) cuts on the both \(b\) quarks.

The flavor excitation and parton showering algorithms incorporated in PYTHIA are (semi)phenomenological substitutes for higher order subprocesses. Their increasing role may again be seen in the ratio \(\sigma_{PYTHIA}(b\overline{b})/\sigma_{LO+NLO}(b\overline{b})\simeq 3.5\) at the LHC energies compared to \(\simeq 2.5\) at FNAL.

The resummation of higher order terms in the semihard scheme involves only light quarks and gluons, and so it does not take into account the production of heavy quarks in parton showers. (This resummation is attributed to gluon distribution functions, but not to the parton matrix element responsible for the creation of heavy quark). For this reason, \(\sigma_{SHA}(b\overline{b})\) is not as quickly rising with energy as \(\sigma_{PYTHIA}(b\overline{b})\).

As in the case of Fermilab energies, the inclusive single particle spectra predicted by the different models look rather similar and only differ in the total normalization (however, this difference fluctuates within one order of magnitude). On the contrary, the disagreement in the shapes of two particle correlations becomes even stronger.

None of the models can be rejected due to comparison with the existing Fermilab data, and each of them may be considered a candidate for the theory at LHC energies. Still large theoretical uncertainties should be taken into account in planning of future experimental performance.
