## 1 Introduction

In test of MDTs that took place both in GIF and in H8 [1], we have collected evidence that during normal operation a non-negligible amount of water vapor was present in the chamber gas. Additional evidence has been collected recently [2]. Several observations have been made on the origin of this contamination:

* It cannot be due to back flow associated to leaks (the chambers were typically tight to, or near, ATLAS specifications, and also because oxygen was not found by gas analysis in the exhaust at a corresponding level);
* For chamber with serial/parallel gas distribution, the contamination grows moving down along tubes in the distribution; within each level of the distribution, the values of the maximum drift time are noticeably consistent, therefore the permeability must be associated to the tubes themselves or to element of the distribution connected to the tubes;
* Since the contamination is present in all-parallel, EC chambers (e.g.: EI), the gas distribution jumpers are not likely to be the cause;
* Permeability via Aluminum should be negligible;
* The best candidate for this is tube end-plug, made of Noryl (with 30% glass fiber), together with the O-rings used in the on-chamber gas distribution (typically in EPDM).

They quote values for several plastics, including Noryl GTX910 resin, for oxygen and for water permeability [4]:

\begin{tabular}{r c} Oxygen: & P\({}_{\rm O}\) & = 70 (cc)(mil) / [ (24h) (100 in2) (bar) ] \\  & = 2.8 E-4 (cm3) (cm) / [(24h) (cm2) (bar)] \\ Water: & P\({}_{\rm W}\) & = 31.5 (g) (mil) / [(24h) (100 in2) ] \(\,\) @ 37.8 C 98% HR \\ \end{tabular}

Since: 37.8 C and 98% HR correspond to 65 mbar = 0.065 bar,

\begin{tabular}{l c c}  & P\({}_{\rm W}\) & = 1.9 mg (cm) / [(24h) (cm2) (bar)] \\ or: & & = 2.4 (cm3)(cm)/[(24h)(cm2)(bar)] \\ \end{tabular}

[the gas densities are at STP]

The permeability is 4000 larger for water than for oxygen. This is typical for these materials. Quoting General Electric:

_"Thermoplastic materials can absorb significant amounts of moisture from the environment whether it be from the atmosphere or from actual immersion in water. The moisture can affect the size of a part as well as mechanical and electrical properties. Absorption of moisture is a reversible process with moisture taken on when the part is dryer than its surrounding environment and losing moisture when the environment is dryer than the part."_ Nylon in water can absorb \(\sim\)10% of its weight (and \(\sim\)1 % in standard atmospheric conditions). Noryl seems on order of magnitude less permeable.

Additional information can be found on a draft of Protvino note (by A. Larionov, translated by A. Kojine, and mentioned in the muon week on April 4, 2000:

_[http://atlas.web.cern.ch/Atlas/project/MDT/www/mirrorprovino/publication/tar.ps_](http://atlas.web.cern.ch/Atlas/project/MDT/www/mirrorprovino/publication/tar.ps_)). They measured the permeability of cylinder made of Noryl, for different gases:

\begin{tabular}{l c} He: & 4.2 E-3 (cm3)(cm)/[(24h)(cm2)(ATM)] \\ Ar: & 6.7 E-3 (cm3)(cm)/[(24h)(cm2)(ATM)] \\ N\({}_{2}\): & 1.5 E-3 (cm3)(cm)/[(24h)(cm2)(ATM)] \\ \end{tabular} These values are significantly larger than the one quoted above for oxygen (but \(\sim\) 400-1600 times smaller that the value quoted above for water). Our colleagues state that the measurement for Ar and N2 suffer from more scaling factor than the one for He.

For comparison, the water permeability of EPDM, used in the O-rings, is normally quoted to be not bigger that 2 perm-mil,5 corresponding to 0.26 mg / [cm (24h) bar], or 14 % of the one for Noryl.

## 3 Rough estimate for water contamination in MDT chambers through the end-plugs

At 20 C, 60 % relative humidity, the partial pressure of water in air is 14 mbar.

The geometry of an end-plug can be roughly approximated by a cylinder, 30 mm diameter, and 25 mm long. Using the formula above, we obtain 0.095 cm3 at STP from each side per day.

For a tube 2 m long (V=1400 cm3), with gas exchange rate of 1 V/day at 3 bar (and full diffusion of the water vapor inside the tube), we estimate the density of water in equilibrium as:0.095 cm3 x 2 [ends] / V / 3 = 45 E-6 to be compared to the observation of \(\sim\)100 ppM for BIS/Rome (BIS/Pavia was \(\sim\)200 ppm, and one EI was 100-200 ppM).

## 4 Estimate for water contamination in MDT chambers through O-rings

Using as an example the Freiburg design, on each side of the tube there are 2 large O-rings on the end-plug, connecting to the gas distribution, plus two additional small ones on the tubelet, going to the gas bar. For the geometry, I shall make the following assumptions:

* the O-ring section is squeezed by 20 % in height, when used;
* assuming conservation of area of the cross section
- has a thickness equal to 35% of the original diameter
* which turns out to be 0.99 of the original diameter, the reduced height, and the original circumference of the O-ring

Then the geometrical parameter needed for the permeability is simply 2.5 x D, where D is the diameter of the O-ring; for D=1.2 cm for the big O-rings, and about 0.3 cm for the small ones, the total effective length is: 2.5 x ( 1.2 cm + 0.3) x 2 = 7.5 cm.

With a permeability of no more than 0.26 mg / [cm (24h) bar], or 0.33 cm3/[cm (24h) bar], we obtain 0.035 cm3 of water vapor from each end of the tube, in the same conditions as above. This is 36% of what estimated above for the end-plug.

The gas out of the chamber vented at 1 vol/day of dry gas should have therefore about 45+15 = 60 ppM of water. Therefore:

* The contribution of water permeability from the O-rings should be smaller than the one from the end-plug, but not negligible.

The water input from the O-rings from the side of the exhaust should not contaminate significantly the chamber; chambers with serial-parallel gas distribution could provide a method to distinguish the effects of leaks from end plugs, and leaks in the distribution (O-rings): the former contribute from each side to the same tube (generating a concentration of water in the three tubes of the serial distribution as: \(\rm p_{1}:p_{2}:p_{3}=p_{1}:2\ p_{1}:3\ p_{1}\), while leaks in the jumper would rather contribute as: \(\rm p_{1}:p_{2}:p_{3}=\ p_{1}:3\ p_{1}:5\ p_{1}\), which leaves equal spacing between the observable effects (e.g.: maximum drift time), but could be distinguished by operating at different gas exchange rate (the first layer is closer to the high ventilation condition).

## 5 Oxygen input via the end-plugs

This is negligible, the fraction in equilibrium with the gas exchange rate would be \(\sim\)0.1 ppM. The observed amount of Oxygen in the exhaust is rather \(\sim\)50--100 ppM, and is presumably dominated by backflow via gas-leaks rather than permeability.

## 6 Time constants

The permeability is proportional to the diffusion constant, and to the solubility of the gas in the given material. Diffusion (D) is in related to delay-time across the barrier. Unfortunately the only information found in the literature is from the tests in Protvino, where values in the range 5--10 x 10\({}^{6}\) cm2/s for He, N2, Ar in Noryl. For L = 2.5 cm effective thickness, the delay-time is L\({}^{2}\)/(6D)= 30--60 h. For water, a faster response is suggested by the much larger value of the permeability, but we cannot distinguish the contribution from the diffusion constant and from the solubility. The permeability across the O-ring is also likely to have a faster response because of the smaller thickness (\(\sim\)0.1 cm). In H8, we observed reduction in the water content of the water content of the chamber-gas over \(\sim\)3 days following the beginning of flushing the Faraday Cages with dry gas.

## 7 Pressure loss - mixture percentage

The variation of gas mixture percentage during long periods of camber storage, without gas circulation, has been suggested as a possible concern for tests of chambers prior to installation.

The Ar loss due to permeability in the Noryl of the end-plugs, according to the measurement in Protvino, would be \(\sim\)0.10 cm3/day, which is \(\sim\)10--100 times smaller than typical leak rates observed in our chambers (few mbar drop per day).

For carbon dioxide, we can roughly estimate the effect by assuming a permeability \(\sim\)3 times larger than for O\({}_{2}\), as seen in many plastic material. Then the effect is \(\sim\)0.001 cm3/day. This is much smaller that the one for Ar, and the origin of this discrepancy is probably in the large permeability measured in Protvino.

If all this would be true, there would be not really visible effects even after 1 year of storage.

A different approach is to consider leaks and observe the difference in rate due to different viscosity of Ar and CO\({}_{2}\) (22.46E-6 and 17.78E-6 Pa s respectively). For a typical pressure loss (e.g.: 3 mbar/day, or 4 cm3/day per tube), we are likely to be in laminar regime both when the loss occurs in a tube or when it takes place (100 times larger) in the gas distribution.6 Then one might argue, but the arguments in favor of this are not uncontroversial, that the leak selects preferably the carbon dioxide. For instance, 10% loss in Ar would correspond to 15 % on CO\({}_{2}\), or 93/7 -> 83.7/5.95 -> 90% remaining pressure-> rescaled to 93.4/6.6. To have a significant impact on the MDT gas-gain stability we would need a larger loss.
