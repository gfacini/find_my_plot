Introduction

During our preparations to build ATLAS muon system, end-cap chambers at the University of Michigan there has been great interest in conforming to the high standards expressed in the baseline specifications. One specific challenge is the requirement that five to six meter wide horizontal and 45 degree oriented chambers be bent such that the tubes' central axes follow the catenary of the anode wires. These wires deviate from straight paths due to their gravitational sag, and for the longest ones the maximum sagitta is \(\sim 450\mu\)m.

The tube bending requirement is rooted perhaps in the idea that long tubes suffer from a number of issues not plaguing short tubes. As noted in a report[1] by the MIT group: For long tubes during fabrication, wire tension and temperature must be assiduously controlled while during operation voltage, temperature and pressure must be highly constrained and vigilantly monitored. However, bending the tubes doesn't remove the wire sag nor obviate the need to accurately record the length, tension and to track environmental parameters in order to recover the \(\hat{x},\hat{y}\) transverse (to the beam axis \(\hat{z}\)) coordinates. If done properly, of course, tube bending would render drift times dependent only on the radial distance to the wire and not on azimuthal or longitudinal positioning.

How best to bend a chamber in order to realize this objective is a non-trivial issue. We anticipate, for example, that it may be necessary to vary wire tensions for nearly every tube in a chamber in order for bending to be effective. Because of the different tube lengths, a chamber bent according to the catenary of a specific wire will not necessarily result in all its wires centered along the entire length of their respective tube axes. This is especially true if equal wire tensions are maintained regardless of length. Beyond this we regard the additional assembly protocols, jogging, record keeping, potential for error and the additional time, effort and expense needed to bend chambers should be justified by a significant improvement in MDT performance.

We accept that, whether or not a chamber is bent, tight fabrication and operating conditions must be maintained to the extent that wire position at any point can be known to within 25 \(\mu\)m and the wire ends to within 10\(\mu\)m. There remains the potentially serious issue that for unbent chambers the large off-center wire displacements would have axially nonsymmetric and longitudinally dependent time-to-space functions which could be difficult to calibrate adequately with the unhappy result of degraded single tube resolution and ultimately poorer momentum resolution.

To evaluate this possibility we have used the _GARFIELD/MAGBOLTZ[5]_ codes to model the drift tubes with off-center anode wires using the baseline gas mixture: Ar 93 %-CO\({}_{2}\) 7% at a pressure of 3 bar and temperature of 297\({}^{\circ}\)K and with operating parameters: gain=\(2\times 10^{4}\), anode voltage=3080 V, wire dimensions 50 \(\mu\)m diameter, gold-plated tungsten tensioned[12] to 375 g, length 500-600 cm, and magnetic field =0.14 Tesla oriented along the wire.[6]

The time-to-space relations obtained from GARFIELD are used to calculate the systematic drift distance measurement errors which depend upon the drift distance (or impact parameter), its angle relative to the plane of the curved wire and the magnitude of the wire displacement, which in turn depends on the track location along the wire. These position dependent errors are then folded into the standard ATLAS stand-alone MDT track digitization and reconstruction algorithm MUONBOX, Version 50004[4] which processes data generated by the detector simulation code LHCTOR, Version 40040.[3] The latter is a GEANT based program which simulates the MDT sensitive detectors and the mass profiles of the internal detectors, magnet and other structural elements. Both codes use the MDT database Version K. The run parameters of LHCTOR included \(\delta\) ray production and all standard physics processes are enabled. Gammas and electrons were tracked to 0.5 Mev, muons to 1 MeV. The analysis parameters of MUONBOX were: intrinsic tube resolution 85\(\mu\)m; random noise hits turned on; \(\delta\) rays, while present in the hit data, were not reconstructed. The actual tube resolution coded in MUONBOX is parameterized to yield an impact parameter dependent value which is then sampled from a normal distribution. The output from the MUONBOX is analyzed to assess the effect on momentum resolution relative to drift tubes in which no systematic drift-time errors are assumed.

## 2 Time-to-space Functions for Off-Axis Wires

We have computed the drift times as a function of track impact parameter in an ATLAS tube (inner radius=1.46 cm) in which the anode wire is displaced from the axis in increments of 100 \(\mu\)m. In general the downward displacement \(y_{sag}\) of a wire of length \(L\) as a function of distance \(X\) from the center is approximated by:

\[y_{sag}=y_{max}(4(X/L)^{2}-1.)\hskip 14.226378pty_{max}=\pi R^{2}\rho L^{2}/8\tau \tag{1}\]where, in CGS units, \(R\) is the wire radius, \(\rho\) the density and \(\tau\) the tension (in grams). For a six meter tungsten wire as specified above, the maximum gravitational sag[13] is 455\(\mu\)m. With a 3kV potential applied an additional \(28\pm 5\mu\)m electrostatic displacement is measured.[7] Therefore the net wire sag in normal operating conditions in a six meter tube is expected to be \(\sim 483\mu\)m.

Before relying too heavily on our time-to-space functions it is desirable to validate these calculations via direct comparison with measured drift velocities. Measurements for a gas mixture of 92%Ar-8%  CO\({}_{2}\) at one atmosphere pressure and no magnetic field have been reported. [8] This composition is reasonably close to our baseline. The calculated drift velocity for this gas as a function of the scaled variable E/P (electric field per unit pressure) is overlayed with laboratory data in Figure 1. This figure also shows the radial distances from the tube center where it can be seen that the operation is for the most part over a region where drift velocity is roughly linearly proportional to the local electric field. Figure 2 shows two essentially indistinguishable curves: the time-to-space functions derived form the measured data and directly from GARFIELD. These plots confirm that GARFIELD adequately reproduces realistic drift times for the MDT gas and that drift time differences for opposing sides of an off-centered wire should be reliable.

When the anode wire is displaced by \(\sim 500\mu\)m the electric field is no longer axially symmetric (Figure 3 ) and for unsaturated gases this implies a drift velocity dependent on the angle \(\psi\) of the track's impact parameter- where \(\psi\) is taken to rotate in the plane around the tube axis ( the \(\hat{y}\hat{z}\) plane for horizontal chambers). In particular, tracks passing directly above and directly below a sagging wire at a fixed distance, such that the drift electrons follow a path along \(\pm\hat{\bf y}\), exhibit the maximum drift velocity variation. This variation and the corresponding maximum variation in the time-to-space function are shown in Figure 4.

By taking the difference of the drift distances for a specific drift time and expressing the latter in terms of drift distance, we can plot the net top-bottom difference in measured impact parameter (\(\delta r\)) as a function of the drift distance. In Figure 5 we show \(\delta r\) for wire displacement ranging from 0 to 500 \(\mu\)m. These drift distance variations represent, in fact, twice the deviation obtained at a point below (or above) a sagging wire and a point at the same distance from a centered wire. That is, \(\delta r\) is twice the maximum systematic error in the measured drift distance. For tracks passing vertically to the left and right of a sagging wire, such that the drift electrons move to the wire along \(\pm\hat{z}\), \(\delta r\) is zero and the measured drift distance is the same as if the wire were centered.

This last result is verified by GARFIELD. We note that our results in Figure 5 are qualitatively consistent with an analytical study for off-centered wires by W. Blum.[2] The systematic shift in the measured **y** coordinate of a track along \(\pm\hat{z}\) for a wire displaced by d in a tube of radius b at a distance r from the wire is derived to first order as:

\[\delta y\equiv\frac{\delta r}{2}\approx\frac{d}{3}\frac{r^{2}}{b^{2}} \tag{2}\]

Here the systematic shift is explicitly related to the the \(\delta r\) in Figure 5. The maximum error is roughly 1/3 the displacement and the fall-off is roughly quadratic.

Figure 1: _Drift velocity as a function of electric field per unit pressure. Also indicated are radial distances from the tube axis._

With this information we can now specify a systematic error for the drift time, or equivalently, measured drift distance for any track passing by a sagging wire, for any angle and at any point along the tube.

The maximum single tube measurement error would occur for tracks passing horizontally above or below the wire, near the tube wall and at the midpoint of the longest tube in a large chamber. For six meter long tubes, the maximum downward wire displacement, as noted earlier is about 483\(\mu\)m. From Figure 5 the magnitude of the top-bottom difference at this point is about 350 \(\mu\)m with a resultant systematic error of half that amount, or 175 \(\mu\)m, about twice the single tube minimum resolution design specification. This worst case, how

ever, has a restricted phase space. Most tracks do not pass at at the point of maximum sag, nor at the tube wall. Moreover, muons, unless they have hard scattered, have an angled trajectory- not horizontal. To anticipate a more realistic systematic error distribution we propagate a hypothetical, uniformly incident flux of tracks over a single plane of a large MDT end-cap chamber similar to EML5[6] (EML3 in ATLAS muon spectrometer TDR naming scheme). The tube lengths in this chamber increment from five to six meters in 64 steps. The result of this exercise is displayed in Figure 6 which shows the relative

Figure 3: _Electric field vectors in a tube at a point where wire sag is 500 \(\mu\) m_

frequency of systematic errors while Figure 7 contains the fraction of tracks for which the error is less than that specified in the abscissa. The two curves in each plot correspond to horizontal tracks and to tracks having an angles of \(34^{\circ}-39^{\circ}\) relative to the beam axis. This is the angular range of stiff muons from an event vertex to an EML5 chamber. For horizontal tracks, errors less than a nominal tube resolution (away from the wire) of \(80\mu\)m occurs more than \(80\%\) of the time while for inclined tracks about \(90\%\) have less than this error. As the plot demonstrates, the effect of the track angle is important: At the top of the EML5 chamber where tubes are longest and the sag is greatest (\(\sim 480\mu\)m) the typical track angle is \(39^{\circ}\), reducing the effective sag to about \(10^{\circ}\).

\(375\mu\)m and the worst case systematic drift distance error to \(\sim 135\mu\)m.

Finally, for consistency we compare the RMS drift distance error (evaluated over the tube radius) to evaluations[9] and [10] for the gas compositions Ar \(90\%\)-\(\rm{CO}_{2}\) 10% and Ar \(93\%\)-\(\rm{CO}_{2}\) 7% respectively. We obtain for the baseline gas \(\approx 1\,8\mu\)m RMS error (evaluated over the tube radius) per 100 \(\mu\)m wire displacement; the results for the referenced gas compositions are \(\approx 17\mu\)m/\(100\mu\)m.

## 3 Momentum Resolution

The integrated distribution in Figure 7 indicates the extent to which a systematic error exceeds the intrinsic tube resolution but reveals little about the net effect on the momentum measurement. A track traversing one long tube also traverses typically six or more such tubes in one chamber. This produces an averaging of the drift distance measurement errors; a path passing near one tube wall with an associated large error could pass near to the wire of the neighboring tube where the error is negligible. This therefore suggests that the degradation of track resolution may be mitigated.

### Results

To evaluate the momentum resolution, data sets of positive and negative muon tracks were generated using LHCTOR GEANT code for fixed \(P_{t}\)s of 20, 100 and 500 GeV. These moment a were selected to span from the Level 2 trigger high \(P_{t}\) threshold, over an interesting region for super-symmetric particles to where a tube's intrinsic resolution dominates the measurement errors.

The azimuthal angle and pseudo-rapidity (\(\eta\)) ranges were set to target the largest, horizontally oriented end-cap chambers that are subject to the bending requirement, these being EML5 (\(1.02<\eta<1.19\)) and EOL3 (\(1.33<\eta<1.49\)). A run covering the extended range \(1.02<\eta<1.49\) was also made to gauge

Figure 7: _Fraction of track hits having less than a systematic error specified in the abscissa._the performance of all the largest end-cap chambers: EML3,4,5 and EOL3. For this analysis the near and intermediate "large" end-cap chambers EIL and EEL were assumed to be bent. That is no systematic errors due to wire sagitta were introduced in these chambers. In the addendum are reported the results when these chambers are also left unbent. Inclusion of vertical and 45\({}^{\circ}\) canted chambers was simulated in the hit digitization and momentum reconstruction code.

Drift distance systematic errors were introduced directly into the digitization code by modifying the impact parameter in a tube before conversion into a corresponding drift time. From knowledge of the distance of the hit from the tube center, the original impact parameter, the tube length and the track angle the wire displacement projected in a plane perpendicular to the track was calculated. An error was then obtained by interpolation of the curves in Figures 5 added to the impact parameter such that it was translated in the same direction as the displacement of tube axis from the wire. Negative impact parameters (e.g., the track crosses under the wire) are thus shortened and positive ones extended.

For all runs, momentum analyses were conducted for three configurations: 1) without the addition of drift time errors (the baseline configuration); 2) with systematic errors and only horizontal chambers considered; 3) with systematic errors averaged over \(\phi\) angle: i.e., with horizontal, 45\({}^{\circ}\) and vertical chambers included. Here the orientation was randomly sampled weighted by the number of each chamber angle and the wire displacement was factored by _cos_(45\({}^{\circ}\)) or zeroed accordingly. It should be noted that the anode wires in the event generator and reconstruction are straight so that the coordinate correction for a gravitationally sagging wire is implicit.

The analysis of the \(P_{t}=500\) Gev muons incident on the EML5 chamber is shown in Figure 8 (A-D). Here are plotted the differences between the reconstructed momenta and the momenta at the exit of the electromagnetic calorimeter. Energy loss fluctuations are therefore included. The baseline resolution in (A) 4.95% \(\pm\).05 % is consistent with the TDR. When the systematic drift time errors are included and only horizontal EML5 chambers are considered (B) the resolution is slightly degraded to 5.44% \(\pm\).05 %. The \(\phi\) angle averaged resolution (C) is 5.28%\(\pm\).06%, marginally poorer than the baseline. (The errors on the resolution in A-C, and subsequent plots are the uncertainties on the gaussian fits.) The number of events occupying the tails, in excess of \(\pm 3\sigma\) of each distribution are statistically equivalent; no significant non-gaussian tails are introduced. Moreover, there is no observed difference in charge sign misidentification: In the all three cases corresponding to plots A, B and C above 1 event in a total of 6698 was misidentified. Plot D shows the \(\eta\) dependence of the resolution- expressed as the RMS variation of each bin. The two curves in D correspond to the baseline and the unbent chamber with _phi_ angle averaging.

Systematic drift error effects on the resolution of \(P_{t}=500\) Gev muons incident on the EOL3 chambers are shown in Figure 9, (A-C). Here the resolution for all three cases discussed above is 5.90%\(\pm\).1% baseline (A), 5.9%\(\pm\) 0.1% (B) and 6.1%\(\pm\)0.1 (C). There is no significant degradation. The relative insensitivity of the momentum reconstruction to the EOL3 tube resolution is probably explained by the very small magnetic field integral from the EML to the EOL stations. As above, there is no increase in the tail occupancy and no change in the number of misidentified charge signs.

Possibly the most relevant analysis includes averaging over all large end cap chambers. The results presented in Figure 10 represent the pseudo-rapidity range from 1.02 to 1.49 extending from bottom of the EOL3 to the top of the EML5 chambers. The baseline resolution is 5.58% \(\pm\).06% (A) while the average over \(\phi\) angle when drift errors are included becomes 5.78% \(\pm\).06%. Here again, there is no significant event increase in the tails beyond \(\pm\)3\(\sigma\) and no change in charge misidentification.

It is also of interest to consider the change in resolution for 100 GeV \(P_{t}\) muons. At this momentum, the resolution is dominated by multiple Coulomb scattering so little influence from systematic time-to-space function errors is expected. The data for the EML5 chambers are presented in Figure 11 (A-D). The baseline resolution is 1.94% \(\pm\).03%. When the drift errors are introduced into horizontal chambers only, the resolution becomes 1.98% \(\pm\).03%, a very minor degradation. The \(\phi\) angle average is 1.97% \(\pm\).03%. There is essentially no significant degradation to the resolution. Furthermore, as observed for the 500 Gev case, the number of outliers does not change. In light of this result it is evident that no resolution degradation is expected for 100 Gev \(P_{t}\) muons incident on the EOL3 chamber.

In a similar vein, (Figure 12 A and B ) there is no observable change to the baseline resolution of about 2% for muons of \(P_{t}\)=20 GeV incident on the EML5 horizontal chambers. Therefore there should be no change in resolution independent of which large end-cap chambers tracks pass.

## 4 Conclusion

We have evaluated the systematic errors in the time-to-space functions for long drift tubes in which the catenary saggitta is \(\leq 500\mu\)m. The associated errors in drift distance measurement for angled tracks, if left uncorrected, can be \(\sim 140\mu\)m. We find, however, that the average degradation to the momentum resolution for events in which the largest, middle section, end-cap chambers (EML5) contribute to the measurement is very small at \(P_{t}\leq 500\) GeV. It becomes unobservable when distant the largest outer section EOL3 chambersare involved. These results likely rests on the fact that the phase space for the biggest drift errors is small; they occur only for tracks passing near the tube wall, far from the tube ends and in horizontal chambers. Furthermore, the contribution of successively offset planes of tubes to the measurement implies that a large error in one tube may be partially mitigated by a small or negligible error in another. The insensitivity of the EOL3 chambers to the resolution is probably due the very weak magnetic field between the middle and outer chambers.

The computations performed here have assumed the current gas mixture

of Ar 93%-CO\({}_{2}\) 7%. The possible use of a more "linear" gas in which the drift velocity has less variation over the tube radius can decrease the assymmetry of the time-to-space function.

Finally it is important to emphasize that these drift errors are systematic and not random. They are calculable and can be parametrized in terms of drift distance, tube longitudinal position and local track angle- as we have indeed demonstrated. Such a parameterization can be incorporated into an anlysis stream to recover resolution for those tracks passing through the horizontal EML5 chambers.

We conclude with the following observations:

1. If large end-cap chambers are constructed with straight multilayers not conforming to wire catenaries, momentum resolution averaged over all such chambers changes from 5.6% to 5.8% (\(\pm\).06%) at \(P_{t}\) = 500 GeV. At \(P_{t}\) = 100 Gev, averaged over the largest, intermediately located chambers (EML5) the resolution changes from 1.94% to 1.97% (\(\pm\).03%). At \(P_{t}\)=20 GeV there is no observable change.
2. While a small resolution change is observable for tracks passing in the

Figure 11: _Momentum resolution \(\Delta P/P\) for \(P_{t}\)=100 Gev muons incident on EML5 chamber. A: no systematic drift errors. B: with errors, horizontal chambers only; C: averaged over \(\phi\) angle._

EML5 chambers there is no significant introduction of non-Gaussian tails.
3. In an offline momentum analyses it is reasonable to expect that a straightforward correction to the time-to-space function can at least partially recover lost resolution. We have demonstrated using GARFIELD/MAGBOLTZ that this systematic error is tractable.

We conclude that no degradation to the Level 2 trigger efficiency at the high \(P_{t}\) threshold and no significant physics performance loss will occur if the large MDT chambers are fabricated without bending.

## 5 Addendum 1

This work initially focused only on the largest endcap chambers where tube lengths extend to about six meters. In recognition of the fact that the intermediate chambers are constructed with long tubes, albeit significantly shorter than those in EML5, we have now included the time-to-space asymmetries in these components as well. The specific run configuration which we have selected consists of \(P_{t}=500\) GeV muons propagating through to the EIL, EEL2 and EML5 chambers, since this case produced the worst case resolution change earlier. In the track reconstruction code the tubes and wires in the EIL are not modified; they are both considered straight and aligned with each other. In reality there is some wire sag in EIL tubes but since the average sagitta is only about 100 \(\mu\)m, these chambers are not likely candidates for bending. In summary: time-to-space asymmetries are included in EEL and EML chambers, in EIL they are not.

The momentum resolution for the baseline (bent tubes), horizontal chambers and averaged over \(\phi\) angle for all large chambers is shown in Figure 13. Within the statisitcal errors of the fits, there is no significant change in the resolution. To appreciate why this can be it is important to realize that the asymterical time-to-space function shift all points of a track in the same direction. When the EML5 chambers were exclusively allowed to have asymmetrical drift times the net result (where one could be seen) was a change in curvature (increase or decrease depending on charge sign). When two stations in a tower (EEL and EML) produce systematic shifts in the drift distances, the net effect is to partially offset the change in curvature that only a single station introduces. While the asymmetries are smaller in the shorter EEL chambers the ambient magnetic field is stronger (0.94 T compared to \(\sim 0.14\) T in the EML region) with a corresponding greater influence on the curvature measurement.

## 6 Addendum 2

This proposal has generated questions regarding the ability of the autocalibration procedure to cope with the asymmetrical drift times. Autocalibration is a procedure that is run periodically to extract and track the time-to-space relations over contiguous sets of drift tubes considered to be operating in a common environment. A common environment is one for a specified chamber in which temperature, magnetic field and pressure gradients are negligible.

The purpose of autocalibration is evidently twofold: Primarily it provides continuous, highly sensitive monitoring of environmental variables affecting the drift velocity. Secondly it can feed into a online database an accurate, continuously updated map of the space-time relations for the entire muon system over the course of a run.

To address these issues we have coded a set of idealized (2 dimensional) routines that reproduce the essential features of the procedure. Our aim is to determine that 1) convergence to an average time-to-space relation occurs even when drift time asymmetries are assumed and 2) that these asymetries can be removed by use of a small look-up table. The routines consist of a track generator and track reconstructor/autocalibrator. The former generates straight tracks through the two multilayers in a single chamber. The drift times are sampled from a standard resolution function shown in Figure 14. The auto-calibrator routine assumes an approximate, initial time-to-space function and that the TDC start times (\(t_{0}\)) and maximum drift times are known. From this starting point the algorithm linearly fits each track and, by using the residuals, iteratively tunes the space-to-time relation until the residuals converge to some minimum width.

We find that even for very crude initial assumption about the space-to-time relation convergence occurs quickly when the track angles are less than 20 degrees relative to the normal of the chamber face. An inital linear relation converges to the correct relation used in the generator (Figure 2) in about

Figure 13: _Momentum resolution \(\Delta P/P\) for \(P_{t}\)=500 Gev muons incident on EIL, \(EEL\) and EML5 chambers, where the latter two have time-to-space asymmetries. A:no systematic drift errors. B:with errors, horizontal chambers only; C: averaged over \(\phi\) angle._

4-6 iterations. For larger angles, in particular in the range of 30-40 degrees the convergence is slow. This may be due to the fact that the drift tubes in a chamber are nearly aligned at these angles. The tubes in a multilayer are exactly aligned at 30 degrees. Tracks at these angles therefore yield similar drift times in all hit tubes.

For the purpose of this study we confine ourselves to the general angular region \((0^{\circ}-20^{\circ})\); this range is approximately the same used in a previous memo[11]. In Figure 16 are shown the residuals over the tube diameter for the starting and final iteration for track sat \(0^{\circ}-20^{\circ}\).

After first using the autocalibrator to converge on a baseline time-to-space relation we introduce systematic shifts to the drift times that would result if the

Figure 14: _Tube resolution function used to generate events for the autocalibration._

wire were displaced off axis. The autocalibrator is then run without iterating to evaluate the degradation of the residuals when these errors are in place. Finally we add a simple routine to the autocalibration that removes the systematic drift time errors. This error correction relies on the GARFIELD predictions (based on the operating voltage, magnetic field, temperature, pressure and gas composition) and assumes that the wire relative to the tube axis is known. In practice it is important to know approximately where along the tube's length a track crosses in order to know the wire's sag locally. (This information must already be provided to the autocalibrator to effect Lorentz angle corrections.)

We find that the baseline width of the residual distribution of 80 \(\mu\)m (Figure 15 A) increases to 95 \(\mu\)m when the systematic error corresponding to 500 \(\mu\)m sag is included (Figure 15 B). However, when corrections are performed, the original width returns. Figure15 C shows the residuals with the corrections assuming a 100 \(\mu\)m random gaussian uncertainty in the location of the tube axes relative to a straight line connecting the tube ends. Figure 15 D shows the residuals with correction, but with a tube axes uncertainty of 300 \(\mu\)m.

An additional gauge of autocalibration is to estimate its sensitivity to variations in the time-to-space function that might result from a change in environmental variables. We can then introduce wire sag and determine if the sensitivity is degraded. To perform this estimate, we need to gauge the baseline variation over the tube radius of the iterated time-to-space function for two data sets covering the same angular range. We do this by fitting a polynomial to the time-to-space functions and calculating the RMS variations of these fits over 75 radial bins between the wire and tube wall. We find that, for 20000 tracks uniformly distributed over a tube diameter and angles \(0^{\circ}-20^{\circ}\), this variation is about 2 \(\mu\)m. With wire sag errors introduced (and the same number of tracks), a new time-to-space function is fit. The RMS variation is now 5 \(\mu\)m, still quite small. We note also that no correction for the asymmetry has been made. To put these variation into some perspective, we now perturb the time-to-space function used to generate events. For this purpose we have, using GARFIELD, calculated a new function assuming a 1% pressure increase. We then allow the autocalibrator to iterate to a new solution. The RMS variation of the difference of the time-to-space functions obtained for this pressure change is 43 \(\mu\)m. Finally we perform a similar test for a temperature fluctuation: the RMS variation in the difference of the functions for a 1\({}^{\circ}\) C temperture change is 16 \(\mu\)m.

## 7 Conclusion

We have performed a preliminary investigation of the autocalibrator technique and have explored its performance when drift time systematic errors from wire sag are included. Although the width of the residual distribution increases when these errors are included, a straightforward correction to the drift distance restore the original width, even after accounting for a significant uncertainty in tube axis location. Furthermore, we have seen that the RMS difference between the baseline (bent tube) time-to-space function and the average time

We conclude that for straight tubes, the autocalibration does not suffer a significant loss in ability to sensitively monitor environmental variables.

* [12] The standard wire tension should be 350g, but as this study was carried out at earlier time an old specification of 375g was used.
* [13] Using the current baseline standard wire tension of 350g, the maximum sag would increase by about 7% from 455 \(\mu\)ms to 487\(\mu\)m.
