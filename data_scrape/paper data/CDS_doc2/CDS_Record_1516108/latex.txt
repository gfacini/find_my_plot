The ATLAS Collaboration

###### Abstract

The Phase 2 upgrade of the LHC and the ATLAS detector will increase the sensitivity to high-mass resonances beyond the Standard Model. The expected gain in sensitivity if the ATLAS dataset of \(pp\) collisions were increased from \(300\,\mathrm{fb}^{-1}\) to \(1000\,\mathrm{fb}^{-1}\) and \(3000\,\mathrm{fb}^{-1}\) at a center-of-mass energy of \(14\,\mathrm{TeV}\) is estimated using parameterizations of detector performance. The increase of a factor of ten in integrated luminosity raises the sensitivity to high-mass resonances by up to 2.4 TeV. With \(3000\,\mathrm{fb}^{-1}\) of data, \(t\bar{t}\) and dilepton resonances with masses up to 6.7 and 7.8 TeV, respectively, can be probed.

Introduction

The Phase 2 upgrade of the ATLAS detector and the LHC will greatly increase their potential for discovery and study of exotic new phenomena. While the range of models and their respective parameters is quite large, their salient features can include the production of high-\(p_{T}\) leptons, photons, jets and missing transverse energy. Our goal is to ensure that the detector design maintains the sensitivity to any signature containing these characteristics. We discuss benchmark models of new high-mass resonances and the expected gain in sensitivity if the ATLAS dataset were increased from 300 fb\({}^{-1}\) to 1000 fb\({}^{-1}\) and 3000 fb\({}^{-1}\) at a center-of-mass energy of 14 TeV.

In order to characterize the high-mass reach we consider resonances with different production and decay mechanisms. As an example of strongly-produced wide resonances we consider the Kaluza-Klein (KK) gluons, \(g_{KK}\), in extra-dimensional models [1]. Many signatures of new physics contain cascade decays. To capture these scenarios we consider the \(g_{KK}\) decay to a pair of top-antitop quarks. Cascade decays can also occur from weakly-produced particles with narrow width. As an example of this scenario we consider \(Z^{\prime}\) bosons decaying to top-antitop pairs in the Topcolor model [1]. Finally, one of the simplest signatures of a new particle, its two-body decay to two prompt leptons, is considered in the \(Z^{\prime}\to ee\) and \(Z^{\prime}\to\mu\mu\) channels [2].

## 2 Monte Carlo Simulation

Standard Model (SM) and beyond-SM (BSM) predictions were generated using Monte Carlo (MC) techniques. Events were simulated and showered using pythia 8.1[3]. Outgoing truth-level electrons, photons, and hadrons were clustered into anti-\(k_{t}\) jets [4] with \(R=0.4\) and \(R=1.0\) using FastJet [5].

The ATLAS sensitivity to new physics depends on jet, lepton, and missing energy reconstruction in the high-pileup regime, with an expected average of 140 interactions per bunch crossing for the 3000 fb\({}^{-1}\) scenario. Fully simulated events under high-pileup conditions have been produced, and efficiencies and resolutions have been estimated for the various objects. These quantities have been used to smear particle-level outputs for various new-physics scenarios.

## 3 Object Selection

Final state particles were taken from the truth-level Monte Carlo output, and their four-momenta were smeared according to pileup-dependent parameterizations. The smeared quantities are used in the event selection. Reconstruction and trigger efficiencies are also parametrized from fully simulated events [6].

Objects are required to pass these selection criteria in all analyses below, unless otherwise noted.1

Footnote 1: ATLAS uses a right-handed coordinate system with its origin at the nominal interaction point (IP) in the centre of the detector and the \(z\)-axis along the beam pipe. The \(x\)-axis points from the IP to the centre of the LHC ring, and the \(y\)-axis points upward. Cylindrical coordinates \((r,\phi)\) are used in the transverse plane, \(\phi\) being the azimuthal angle around the beam pipe. The pseudorapidity is defined in terms of the polar angle \(\theta\) as \(\eta=-\ln\tan(\theta/2)\).

* Electrons: \(E_{T}>25\) GeV, \(|\eta|<2.47\) (excluding \(1.37<|\eta|<1.52\))
* Muons: \(p_{T}>25\) GeV, \(|\eta|<2.4\)
* Anti-\(k_{t}\) jets with \(R=0.4\): \(p_{T}>25\) GeV, \(|\eta|<2.5\)
* Anti-\(k_{t}\) jets with \(R=1.0\): \(p_{T}>250\) GeV, \(|\eta|<2.5\)In order to avoid reconstructing electrons as jets, the nearest jet to a selected electron is removed, provided the separation between them satisfies \(\Delta R=\sqrt{(\Delta\eta)^{2}+(\Delta\phi)^{2}}<0.2\). Any electron within \(\Delta R<0.2\) of a selected jet after this overlap removal is also removed.

The missing transverse energy (\(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\)) of an event is defined as the negative vector sum of the transverse momenta of all selected electrons, muons and anti-\(k_{t}\) jets with \(R=0.4\).

## 4 Search for \(t\bar{t}\) Resonances

### Introduction

Strongly- and weakly-produced \(t\bar{t}\) resonances provide benchmarks not only for cascade decays containing leptons, jets (including \(b\)-quark jets) and \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\), but also the opportunity to study highly boosted topologies. We study the sensitivity to the KK gluon via the process \(pp\to g_{KK}\to t\bar{t}\) in both the dileptonic and the lepton+jets decay modes of the \(t\bar{t}\) pair. These decay modes are complementary in a number of ways.

The lepton+jets mode allows a more complete reconstruction of the final-state invariant mass which increases the sensitivity of the search. This is particularly true for narrow resonances, such as the top-color \(Z^{\prime}\) boson. On the other hand, the lepton+jets channel is more susceptible to \(W\)+jets background and to loss of top quark discrimination when the top decay products merge at high \(p_{T}\). The dominant background in the lepton plus jets channel is \(t\bar{t}\).

The dominant background for the dilepton channel is also \(t\bar{t}\) production. \(b\)-tagging is not essential for suppressing the reducible SM backgrounds (\(b\)-tagging can help suppress diboson and \(Z\)+jets backgrounds but these are already insignificant after the \(Z\)-mass veto). The dilepton channel is also less susceptible to the merging of top decay products because leptons (especially muons) are easier to identify in close proximity to the \(b\)-jet. However the dilepton channel does not allow for reconstruction of the resonance mass.

By studying both channels we can compare the more robust estimate of the sensitivity from the dilepton channel to the more sensitive lepton+jets channel.

### Lepton Plus Jets Event Selection

Events are considered \(t\bar{t}\) candidates in the lepton+jets channel provided they meet the following criteria:

* Exactly one selected lepton which fires the trigger
* At least one selected anti-\(k_{t}\) jet with \(R=0.4\) (leptonic \(b\)-jet)
* At least one selected anti-\(k_{t}\) jet with \(R=1.0\) and mass \(m_{jet}>120\) (hadronic top-jet)
* \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}>50\) (\(\mathrm{GeV}\)

The selected lepton and hadronic top-jet are required to be separated by \(\Delta R>1.0\). If there are multiple hadronic top-jet candidates which fulfill this criterion, the one with the highest \(p_{T}\) is chosen. In order to prevent the double-counting of calorimeter deposits in the selected jets, the leptonic \(b\)-jet and hadronic top-jet are required to be separated by \(\Delta R>1.5\). If there are multiple leptonic \(b\)-jet candidates that pass this requirement, the one with the highest \(p_{T}\) is chosen.

The \(p_{z}\) of the neutrino is determined by imposing the \(W\) boson mass constraint on the lepton-neutrino system [1]. If there are two real-valued \(p_{z}\) solutions, the one with the smallest \(|p_{z}|\) is used. If there are no real-valued \(p_{z}\) solutions, the \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\) vector is varied minimally to obtain one real solution.

The four-momentum of the \(t\bar{t}\) system is defined as the sum of the four-momenta of the selected lepton, neutrino, b-jet, and top-jet. The \(t\bar{t}\) system's invariant mass is denoted by \(m_{t\bar{t}}\).

### Dilepton Event Selection

Events are considered \(t\bar{t}\) candidates in the dilepton channel provided they meet the following criteria:

* Exactly two selected opposite-sign leptons
* At least one lepton must fire the trigger
* At least two selected anti-\(k_{t}\) jets with \(R=0.4\) (\(b\)-jets)
* \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}>60\) GeV

In order to reduce the \(Z\)+jets background, the dilepton system is required to have an invariant mass outside of the \(Z\) mass window (\(81\GeV<m_{\ell\ell}<101\GeV\)) if the leptons are of the same flavor.

### Statistical Analysis

In the lepton+jets (dilepton) channel the statistical analysis is performed by constructing templates of the \(m_{t\bar{t}}\) (\(H_{T}\)) distribution for background plus varying amounts of signal at different resonance masses and cross sections. Here \(H_{T}\) is defined as the scalar sum of the transverse momenta of the two selected leptons, the two leading jets, and the \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\). The likelihood function is defined as the Poisson probability product over all bins for the pseudo-data given the expectation in each bin.

In the lepton+jets channel, the \(W\)+jets background normalization is given by the theory cross section, while the \(t\bar{t}\) background is floated and is effectively constrained by the low-\(m_{t\bar{t}}\) region. Similarly, in the dilepton channel the \(Z\)+jets and diboson background normalizations are given by the theory cross section, while the \(t\bar{t}\) background is constrained by the low-\(H_{T}\) region. The resulting expected limits in the absence of signal, which we quote as a measure of sensitivity using statistical errors only, are shown in Table 1.

The \(m_{t\bar{t}}\) (\(H_{T}\)) distribution and the resulting limits as a function of the \(g_{KK}\) pole mass for the lepton+jets (dilepton) channel is shown in Figure 3 (Figure 2). The increase of a factor of ten in integrated luminosity raises the sensitivity to high-mass \(t\bar{t}\) resonances by up to 2.4 TeV.

### Introduction

In our sensitivity studies of the \(Z^{\prime}\) boson, we have separated the dielectron and dimuon channels since their momentum resolutions scale differently with \(p_{T}\) and the detector acceptances are different. The background is dominated by the SM Drell-Yan production, while \(t\overline{t}\) and diboson backgrounds are substantially smaller. Therefore, only the Drell-Yan background is considered in this study. There is an additional background from non-prompt electrons due to photon conversions which needs to be suppressed in the dielectron channel. We assume that the required rejection of this background will be achieved with the upgraded detector.

### Event Selection

Events are considered \(Z^{\prime}\rightarrow\ell\ell\) candidates provided they meet the following criteria:

* Exactly two selected same-flavor leptons
* At least one selected lepton must fire the trigger
* \(Z^{\prime}\rightarrow\mu\mu\) candidate events must have two opposite-sign muons.

### Statistical Analysis

This study employs the same statistical analysis used for the \(t\bar{t}\) studies above. Templates of the \(m_{\ell\ell}\) spectrum are constructed for the background plus varying amounts of signal at different resonance masses

and cross sections. The Sequential Standard Model (SSM) \(Z^{\prime}_{SSM}\) boson, which has the same fermionic couplings as the Standard Model \(Z\) boson, is used as the signal template. The \(m_{\ell\ell}\) distribution and the resulting limits as a function of \(Z^{\prime}_{SSM}\) pole mass are shown in Figs. 4 and 5 for the \(ee\) and \(\mu\mu\) channels, respectively.

The expected limits in the absence of signal, which we quote as a measure of sensitivity using statistical errors only, are shown in Table 2. The increase of a factor of ten in integrated luminosity raises the sensitivity to high-mass dilepton resonances by up to 1.3 TeV.

## 6 Conclusions

We have shown results of sensitivity studies for several representative exotic resonances, comparing ATLAS datasets of 300 fb\({}^{-1}\), 1000 fb\({}^{-1}\), and 3000 fb\({}^{-1}\) of integrated luminosity delivered by the LHC at a \(pp\) collision energy of \(\sqrt{s}=14\) TeV. Strongly- and weakly-produced \(t\bar{t}\) resonances and narrow dilepton resonances serve as benchmark processes. The increase of a factor of ten in integrated luminosity raises the sensitivity to high-mass resonances by up to 2.4 TeV. With 3000 fb\({}^{-1}\) of data, \(t\bar{t}\) and dilepton resonances with masses up to 6.7 and 7.8 TeV, respectively, can be probed.
