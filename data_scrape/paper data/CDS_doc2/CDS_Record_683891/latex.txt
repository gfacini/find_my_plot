**Abstract**

The BML 98 has been measured on the X-ray Cern facility. The data have been analyzed and compared with the Frascati metrology results on the jig used for the assembly. The results are satisfactory both for global precision (the 20 \(\upmu\)m goal has been achieved ) and for systematics ( the metrology results are well reproduced ).

Introduction

The construction of the BML98 has been performed in Frascati in July-September '98. The jigging used for the construction has been measured using a 3D machine of the metrology facilities of the Frascati Laboratory. A RASNIK based monitoring system has been used during the assembly. The chamber has two multilayers with three tube layers each, 48 tubes per layer; the tube length is 4 meters. The spacer height is 317 mm.

In the following a brief description of the chamber construction procedure is given.

A cartesian coordinate system is adopted with the X axis parallel to the wires, the Y axis running from layer to layer, the Z axis running across the tubes of one layer.

To achieve the high precision required we use a jig in order to position in a precise way the tubes. The components of the jig are the combs and the towers.

A certain number of comb lines fixed on the granite table determine the precise position of the tubes within one layer. The towers determine the precise positioning of one layer with respect to the spacer and the layers previously glued.

The towers structure can be divided in three parts:

1. base;
2. interface;
3. sphere housing.

The interfaces allow us to change the Y and the Z position of the sphere housings correspondingly to different layers in the chamber. The precision of the spacer is not relevant in the assembly procedure and only a moderate precision is required ( a few hundreds microns). For this reason a large gap is foreseen between the tubes of the first layer and the cross-plates.

It is clear that correspondingly to the assembly procedure, the precision in Z within one layer is only determined by the precision of the two external comb lines, while the layer to layer precision is determined by the precision of the displacement provided by the towers.

Possible deformations because of gravity, if the chamber is not correctly supported, influence also the wire position. When the chamber is held horizontally, this will mostly affect the Y coordinate.The final system for the cross plate sagitta correction has been used in the assembly.

## 2 The X-Ray Tomograph: Data, Analysis, Results

### Data

A detailed description of the tomograph is in ref 1.

The tomograph provides two-dimensional scan of a slice of the chamber. Eight scans have been performed in eight different positions along the wires. The chamber has also been rotated along the X axis by 180 degrees and measured again in the up-side down condition. The two conditions will be indicated as position P=0 and P=1.

The Tomograph provides the Z and Y coordinates for the wires seen at a fixed X with a precision of a few microns (see ref 1 )

The Rasnik monitor information during the measurement has not been recorded, then the chamber sag along the wire could be not controlled, for this reason the shorter tubes are not in the correct position in the Y coordinate, and they are taken out in this analysis.

### Analysis

The wire positions are represented by a two-dimension regular grid and a fit procedure is applied to the data using three free parameters:

* the Z Pitch ( that corresponds to the pitch of the combs );
* the Y pitch ( that corresponds to the stepping in the towers );
* the distance between the two inner layers ( that corresponds to the height of the towers with respect to the granite table and the height of the combs ).

Three more parameters are needed in the fit for the grid positioning ( two for the origin and one for a relative angle ) with respect to the data. Of course these last parameters have no physical meaning.

From this fit we obtain the overall precision of the chamber by computing in both coordinates the distribution of the residuals between the measured wire positions and the corresponding grid nodes.

Furthermore the fit provides the values of the grid parameters that allow us to check systematic effects in the chamber construction.

### Results

In the following plots the black dots describe the P=0 case the open dots the P=1 case.

Figure 1 shows the residual distribution for both Z and Y for the scan close to the RO side of the chamber in P=1. The RMS is of the order of 20 microns for both Z and Y.

Figure 2 shows the RMS of the residual distribution versus the scan position. In the HV side of the chamber an asymmetry between P=0 and P=1 is visible for the Y coordinate. One possible explanation is the introduction of some deformation in the chamber due to the supporting system in the tomograph.

Figure 3 shows the value of the two pitches. The Z pitch is X independent (as expected) the value is \(30035.6\pm 0.1\), the Y pitch shows a light dependence with the X position. The average value is \(26028.0\pm 3.0\).

Figure 4 shows the third parameter, the distance between the two multilayers. What is relevant in this result is the large difference on this quantity measured in P=0 and in P=1. This particular effect is still under study and needs more detailed information concerning the possible chamber deformation but also a possible variation of the scale factor of the tomograph when large distances are measured.

## 3 The Jig Metrology

To study possible systematic effects in the chamber construction we need to have the reference quantities from the jig and check how well the jig parameters are reproduced in the assembled chamber.

### The Combs

The combs have been measured positioning on them a series of calibrated Aluminum rods and then measuring the position of the center of the circle in the 2D projection.

The comb precision in Y and Z and the absolute height and pitch of the combs are provided by this measurement. A reference comb has been measured together with each individual one and used to normalize the scale effect due to the temperature.

For the pitch evaluation, a 1D grid fit has been performed on each individual comb data.

The resulting pitch has been corrected according to the results of the measurements of the reference comb and all the values have been averaged.

For the comb height, the value is obtained as the average of all the positions.

The resulting value is 30035.3 \(\mathrm{\SIUnitSymbolMicro m}\) for the pitch and 121687.0 \(\mathrm{\SIUnitSymbolMicro m}\) for the height.

The best seven combs have been selected out of the total sample for the construction of the two external comb lines that are the most important for the precision positioning of the wires. Fig 5 shows, for the best seven combs:

* the residuals with respect to the grid with the common value for the pitch, resulting in a RMS of 1.9 \(\mathrm{\SIUnitSymbolMicro m}\) ;
* the residuals for the height with respect to the common comb height, resulting in a RMS of 2.7 \(\mathrm{\SIUnitSymbolMicro m}\).

### The Towers

Concerning the entire towers, we have measured the center of a sphere in the sphere housings.

There are two kind of towers, in the jig; the first ones in the so called reference side and the other ones in the other side. The towers in the reference side determine two coordinates, the Y and the Z of the sphere housings, while the others determine the Y only.

For each tower we have three different heights because of the three different layer heights; they are provided by the three interfaces interposed between the base of each tower and the sphere housing. In the reference towers the interfaces provide the Z origin of the layer and the half pitch Z displacement for the central one.

In the chamber construction we use six towers, but only the ones in the four corners are relevant for the chamber precision. In fact the precision in the positioning of the central cross plate is relevant for the tube but not for the wire.

We have performed many measurement and also many repetitions of the same measurement. The relevant results are:

* the height of the center of the spheres for the first layer with respect to the granite table is 295197.9 \(\pm\) 7.2 \(\mathrm{\SIUnitSymbolMicro m}\),
* the average value of the eight steps in Y for the four relevant towers is 26022.7\(\pm\) 6.1,
* the Z origin is a relative quantity between different layers. If we assume the first layer as zero, the origin of the other two are, for the central layer, 15015.9 \(\pm\) 6.2 \(\mathrm{\SIUnitSymbolMicro m}\) ( compared with half nominal pitch = 15017.5 ), for the third layer, 9.2 \(\pm\) 7.4 \(\mathrm{\SIUnitSymbolMicro m}\) ( should be zero ).

## 4 Methodology Vs. X-Ray DATA

From the comparison of the x-ray measurements with the metrology results a check of the systematics in the chamber can be done. A summary is presented in table 1 ; in particular, a comparison with the nominal values is also presented there.

For the Z pitch the agreement is very good; the small difference in the absolute value can be easily explained with thermal differences of the order of half degree centigrade.

The agreement is also good for the Y pitch even if the difference is of the order of 5 micron and a light dependence with the X position is not expected.

The expected distance between the two multilayers can be calculated from the metrology results concerning the combs and the towers to be 347021.8 \(\pm\) 15.4. The quoted error is a simple propagation of the statistical error, no systematic error is included at this level of the analysis.

The values of this parameter coming from the tomograph and from the metrology are not in agreement. As already mentioned it is relevant in this result the large difference of this quantity measured in P=0 and in P=1. This particular effect is still under study.

## 5 Conclusions

In the BML built in Frascati in September 1998 the "goal" of the 20 micron precision in the wire positioning has been achieved. Furthermore two of the three relevant parameters coming out from the global fit to the tomograph data are in good agreement with the corresponding values of the jig components measured in a 3D machine. The disagreement seen on the distance between the two multilayers is still under study.

An important issue of this work is to try to define a procedure for the chamber certification using the tomograph.

The analysis performed on the BML98 tomograph data shows that we were able to reproduce the relevant parameters of the jigging on the chamber. This of course needs a confirmation from other chambers built using the same jig.

In this sense the certification of the chamber is divided in two separated steps: a) the determination of the precision of the chamber; b) the reproducibility for each production site of the relevant parameters.

To certify the module-0 a way to proceed is to look at the overall precision and to compare the relevant parameters with the measured values of the jig.
