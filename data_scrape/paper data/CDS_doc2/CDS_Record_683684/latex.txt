## 1 Introduction

It is clear that original Pavia gas jumper/1/ does not permit large difference of lengths of connected tubes. To avoid this we proposed so called "spherical" gas jumper/2/. Immediately question arises about torque induced by this jumper due to tolerances of a distance between the end plug central pins. To answer the question we did some measurements. The most of the measurements concern of the spherical gas jumper and few ones were performed for the original Pavia gas jumper with flat sitting. Below results of measurements are presented.

## 2 Measurements procedure and results

### Mesurements with the spherical jumper

Transverse displacement of the internal part of the end plug central brass pin was measured after connection of pair of the end plugs by the spherical gas jumper. The displacement can reach about 1\(\mu\)m for torque 0.15 N\(\cdot\)m applied to the central brass pin of the standard end plug. The value of the displacement is too small to be measured, therefore two special end plugs with more weak conjunction between the central brass pin and Noryl body of the end plug were constructed for these tests. Diameter of the end plugs was about of 29.8 mm. The end plugs were squeezed between metal plates (Fig.1). Into internal part of the central brass pin of upper end plug a metal rod was inserted and vertical displacement of the rod was measured by gauge.

A calibration of the rod vertical displacement versus torque was performed by squeezing of external parts of the central pins by a spring with known force when the gas jumper was removed. The scale factor is 0.0191\(\pm\)0.0025 N\(\cdot\)m/\(\mu\)m.

We performed several sets of the torque measurements. For each set we measured the vertical displacement of the rod as a function of the thickness of shim (\(\Delta\)) inserted between the end plugs as it is shown in fig.1. With using of our calibration we were able to translate this displacement into torque value. The jumper closing caps were turned on with fixed force (torque) providing 25% squeezing of O-rings. The sets of measurements differ one from another by sequence of the caps turning on:

1. the 1st set of measurements: 1.1 the jumper is placed, caps are not turned on; 1.2 the upper cap is turned on with fixed force; 1.3 the lower cap is turned on with fixed force; 1.4 the lower cap is turned out; 1.5 the upper cap is turned out;
2. the 2nd set of measurements: 2.1 the jumper is placed, caps are not turned on; 2.2 the lower cap is turned on with fixed force; 2.3 the upper cap is turned on with fixed force; 2.4 the upper cap is turned out; 2.5 the lower cap is turned out;
3. the 3d set of measurements: 3.1 the jumper is placed, caps are not turned on; 3.2 caps are slightly tighten by many consequent steps by turns; the lower cap is finally turned on with fixed force; 3.3 the upper cap is finally turned on with fixed force; 3.4 the upper cap is turned out; 3.5 the lower cap is turned out;
4. the 4th set of measurements: 4.1 the jumper is placed, caps are not turned on; 4.2 caps are slightly tighten by many consequent steps by turns; the upper cap is finally turned on with fixed force; 4.3 the lower cap is finally turned on with fixed force; 4.4 the lower cap is turned out; 4.5 the lower cap is turned out;For each thickness of the shim and each item (i.j, where i=1,2,3,4; j=1,2,3,4,5) we performed 10 measurements of the rod displacement. The resulting rod position was calculated as a mean of 10 measurements. In fig.2.7 results of the measurements are presented. Only results for items i.2, i.3 and i.4 (i=1,2,3,4) are shown. Measurements for items i.1 and i.5 give always about 0. for the rod transverse displacement. They were done to confirm a stability of the setup.

Fig.2 shows dependence of vertical displacement of the rod as a function of the shim thickness. Error bars in fig2. are RMS for 10 measurements in each point. Fig.3.6 show the results after translation of the vertical displacement into torque value. Dependences of torque vs. shim thickness were fitted by a linear function. In fig.7 dependences of the torque versus shim thickness are superimposed for all 4 cases of the caps turning on.

For fixed shim thickness 360\(\mu\)m we did measurement of the rod displacement as a function of relative shift of the end plugs in X-direction. The caps were closed in accordance to the 4th procedure. Results are presented in fig.8,9.

### Measurements with Pavia jumper

Using similar setup we measured torque induced by relative displacement in X-direction of pair of the end plugs connected by the original Pavia jumper with flat sitting. For this measurements was used another pair of end plugs with another calibration of torque vs. vertical displacement of the rod with the scale factor equal to 0.075 N\(\cdot\)m/\(\mu\)m. The same force as for the spherical jumper was used for turning on of the caps. Results are shown in fig.10,11,12, where torque versus relative displacement of end plug is plotted for procedures of the caps turning on 1,2,3. Lines are linear fit.

## 3 Conclusions

* Tolerance for eccentricity of the end plug central pin w.r.t. end plug reference surface is 50\(\mu\)m, therefore tolerance of distance between two neighbour central pins of a chamber is \(\pm\)100 \(\mu\)m.
* The spherical jumper gives torque applied to the central brass pin of the end plug.
* The torque linearly dependents of transverse distance between the end plugs: change of torque is about 0.022 N\(\cdot\)m per 100 \(\mu\)m of the distance change.
* The torque depends on the succession of the caps turning on. For different successions the torque changes up to 0.05 N\(\cdot\)m. It is caused by a deformation of rubber of O-rings when the caps are turned on. The optimal succession of turning on the caps is one when the caps are tighten by many sequential steps by turns.
* When the spherical gas jumper is used it is possible to provide the torque which will squeeze tubes to avoid a rapture of glue in a chamber. In fig.3.6 positive torque corresponds to the squeezing of tubes. If we take \(\Delta\) in range from 100 \(\mu\)m to 300 \(\mu\)m then the maximal torque will be from 0 to 0.05 N\(\cdot\)m for optimal closing succession.

* The torque dependence versus X-shift is small, about 0.013 N\(\cdot\)m/mm.
* For Pavia gas jumper with flat sitting the torque also depends on succession of turning in range of 0-0.03 N\(\cdot\)m. The relative shift of end plugs in X-direction leads to the torque about of 0.1 N\(\cdot\)m/mm.
