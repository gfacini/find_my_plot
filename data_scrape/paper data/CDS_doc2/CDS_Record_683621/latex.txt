**Abstract**

The analytical representation of the longitudinal hadronic shower development from the face of a calorimeter is presented and compared with experimental data. The suggested formula is particularly useful at designing, testing and calibration of huge calorimeter complex like in ATLAS at LHC.

where \(\gamma(a,z)\) is the incomplete gamma function [5]. This function can be calculated by using the program library [6]. The confluent hypergeometric function in the second term may be calculated by using the series development:

\[{}_{1}F_{1}(1,a+1,z)=1+\frac{z}{a+1}+\frac{z^{2}}{(a+1)(a+2)}+\ldots. \tag{5}\]

This series has the remarkable property: at \(a=0\) it corresponds to the function \(e^{z}\). For real calorimeters with longitudinal size usually less then 10 \(\lambda_{I}\) the value of \(z=(1-d)\frac{x}{\lambda_{I}}\) does not exceed 0.2. Therefore it is sufficient only 3 terms in order to calculate the function \({}_{1}F_{1}(1,a+1,z)\) with the precision of 0.1%.

The normalisation factor is

\[N=E_{beam}\bigg{/}\int\limits_{0}^{\infty}\frac{dE(x)}{dx}dx. \tag{6}\]

The integral in the denominator can be calculated by using the following relation [7]:

\[\int\limits_{0}^{\infty}e^{-\lambda z}z^{\nu}{}_{1}F_{1}\left(\alpha,\gamma,k \,z\right)\ dz=\Gamma(\nu+1)\lambda^{-\nu-1}{}_{2}F_{1}\left(\alpha,\nu+1, \gamma,\frac{k}{\lambda}\right)\!, \tag{7}\]

where \({}_{2}F_{1}\left(\alpha,\beta,\gamma,z\right)\) is the hypergeometric function [5], which in our case have the very simple form:

\[{}_{2}F_{1}(1,a+1,a+1,\,z)=\frac{1}{1-z}. \tag{8}\]

As a result we obtain

\[N=\frac{a\ E_{beam}}{\lambda_{I}\ \Gamma(a+1)\ (w\ X_{o}\ b^{-a}+(1-w)\ \lambda_{I}\ d^{-a})}. \tag{9}\]

In Fig. 1 the calculations by formula (3) are shown and compared with the experimental data at \(20-140\) GeV obtained by using the conventional iron-scintillator calorimeter [4] and the one with innovative feature -- the longitudinal orientation of the scintillating tiles [8]. The good agreement is observed.

So, now there is useful analytical formula which gives the possibility immediately to obtain the longitudinal shower energy deposition from calorimeter face.
