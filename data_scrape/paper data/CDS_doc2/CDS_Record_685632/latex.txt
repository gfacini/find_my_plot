###### Abstract

In the present note the arguments for having a small independent compartment at the end of the electromagnetic calorimeter are summarized. Such a compartment is useful for improving the energy measurement of high energetic, electromagnetic showers. In addition it can be used to improve the e/\(\pi\) separation, especially at low energies, in the case where small leakage energies cannot be measured reliably in the hadronic calorimeter.

Introduction

The layout of the longitudinal structure of the electromagnetic calorimeter is still under debate. Whereas there is consensus to have a preshower detector and at least an additional two block structure, it is still not well established what the merits of a small compartment at the back of the calorimeter are. The focus of the present study is to investigate the usefulness of such a compartment for an improved energy measurement of high energy electromagnetic showers. Since the answer to the question also depends on the total thickness of the electromagnetic calorimeter, the resolution of 2 TeV electrons will be studied as a function of this thickness with and without energy weighting in the last compartment.

Another, independent argument in favour of a short last segment has already been brought forward in the study of the e/\(\pi\) separation [1]. It has been shown that a last compartment can be used to improve the e/\(\pi\) separation in the case that the hadronic calorimeter cannot be used to measure small leakage energies reliably. The details can be found in Ref.[1] and will not be repeated here.

The present simulation has been performed by assuming a lead liquid argon (LAr) calorimeter with the internal structure as described in Ref. [1]. The layout of the longitudinal structure has however been slightly changed. For the purpose of the present study the calorimeter has been extended by four additional compartments, providing in total a thickness corresponding to 36.6 radiation lengths (\(X_{0}\) ). The details of the layout are shown in Fig.1. Electronic noise and pile-up noise have not been taken into account since they do not have any influence on the answers to the questions mentioned above. Especially at high energies a noise term of the form \(\gamma/E\) is negligible. Some material in front of the calorimeter has however been considered. Assumed is the version B of the ATLAS tracker as described in the ATLAS letter of intent [2] and the coil and cryostat, corresponding in total to a material of \(\sim 1.25\)\(X_{0}\) at central rapidity (\(\eta=0\).). It should be noted that all results quoted in the following have been obtained at this rapidity value. In order to separate the effects of longitudinal leakage from transverse leakage, the electron energies have been reconstructed by summing up \(5\times 5\) cells with a granularity of \(\Delta\eta\times\Delta\varphi=0.02\times 0.02\).

## 2 Energy resolution as a function of the calorimeter thickness

The energy resolution for 2 TeV electrons is shown in Fig.2 as a function of the thickness of the calorimeter. Up to about \(32X_{0}\) the energy resolution improves with increasing calorimeter thickness; beyond this no significant improvement is found anymore. The reconstructed electron energy spectra are shown in Fig.3 for the various calorimeter depths considered. It should be noted that the calibration constants have been fixed for a calorimeter with a thickness corresponding to \(26.8X_{0}\). If the calorimeter thickness is below \(\sim 27X_{0}\) asymmetric energy distributions with tails on the low energy side are found. The individual energy contributions in the various compartments at the end of the electromagnetic stack are shown in Fig.4. As expected from the results obtained for the energy resolutions, there is no significant energy fraction in the compartments beyond 31.7 \(X_{0}\).

Summary

The present study has shown that a calorimeter with a thickness of \(27X_{0}\) is not thick enough to contain electromagnetic showers in the 2 TeV range. The energy resolution for high energies can either be improved by using a deeper calorimeter (\(\sim 32X_{0}\)) or by having an independent compartment at the end of the electromagnetic calorimeter, so that its energy can be weighted. Since in particular in the end-cap regions one needs to measure electromagnetic energies at the scale of 2 TeV or even higher, we consider such a segment as useful, even if a thicker calorimeter is envisaged. By increasing the thickness of the calorimeter, the problem is just shifted to higher energies and therefore an individual last segment is maybe a more elegant and more economical solution.

In addition it may also be useful in energy weighting techniques for correcting jet energies for losses in the material between the electromagnetic and the hadronic calorimeter in a hybrid solution. This point has not yet been studied completely.

As already mentioned, another independent argument in favour of the last segment is coming from improvements in the e/\(\pi\) separation.
