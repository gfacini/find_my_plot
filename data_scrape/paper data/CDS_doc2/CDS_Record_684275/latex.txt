**Abstract**

A study of the measurement of the top quark mass in leptonic final states with \(J/\Psi\) is presented. This indirect method for the determination of the top quark mass relies heavily on the proper Monte Carlo description of top production and decay. This channel, which can be exploited only at high luminosity, would allow a precise measurement of the top mass with both statistical and systematic uncertainties at the level of 1 GeV.

## 1 Introduction

In this channel, one exploits the correlation between the top mass and the invariant mass \(M_{IJ/\Psi}\) of the system made of a \(J/\Psi\) (from the decay of a b hadron) and the isolated lepton coming from the associated W decay (see figure 1). This method was originally described in [1] and developed in more detail in [2].

In the decay of the other top quark, the presence of a non isolated muon inside the b-jet is required in order to uniquely define the top decay topology. The overall branching ratio BR can be splitted into 3 parts: \(BR=BR_{1}\times BR_{2}\times BR_{3}\), where \(BR_{1}\) is the branching ratio of \(pp\longrightarrow\bar{t}t\), with \(\bar{t}\) decaying in anything and \(t\longrightarrow l\nu+b\) (where l stands for e and \(\mu\), and taking into account the charge conjugate reaction), \(BR_{2}\) is the branching ratio of the chain \(b\longrightarrow J/\Psi\longrightarrow\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\), and \(BR_{3}\) is the branching ratio of \(\bar{b}\longrightarrow\mu^{+}\). One has [3]:

- \(BR_{1}\simeq 42\%\)

- \(BR_{2}\simeq 7\times 10^{-4}\)

- \(BR_{3}\simeq 10.8\%\)

Hence, the overall branching ratio is \(BR\simeq 3.2\times 10^{-5}\). Assuming the \(t\bar{t}\) production cross-section of 833 pb and for one year of running at high luminosity, one can expect: \(N=833\times 3.2\times 10^{-5}\times 10^{5}\simeq 2700\) events to be produced (of this final state topology).

## 2 Analysis

Events have been generated with Pythia [4] and passed through the ATLAS fast simulation package ATLFAST [5].

Events are selected by requiring one isolated lepton with \(p_{T}>30~{}GeV\) (corresponding to the lowest \(p_{T}\) threshold for single lepton in the ATLAS trigger menus at high luminosity) and \(|\eta|<2.4\), three non-isolated muons with \(p_{T}>3~{}GeV\) and \(|\eta|<2.4\), with the invariant mass of two of them (having opposite signs) being compatible with the \(J/\Psi\) mass. After selection cuts are applied and for one year of running at high luminosity, 430 events are left, giving a reconstruction efficiency of 16%. On figure 2, the transverse momentum distribution of the top quark, the isolated lepton, the in-bjet muon and the J/\(\Psi\) are shown.

Figure 3 represents the \(IJ/\Psi\) invariant mass distribution, for five years of running at high luminosity. The combinatorial background consists only of a few events. The distribution is fitted by a gaussian. The resulting mean \(IJ/\Psi\) invariant mass is 68.1 GeV with a resolution of 22.4 GeV.

For five years of running at high luminosity, the statistical uncertainty on \(M_{IJ/\Psi}\) would be approximately 0.5 GeV.

## 3 Correlation between \(M_{IJ/\Psi}\) and \(m_{top}\)

The correlation between \(M_{IJ/\Psi}\) and the top mass is shown on figure 4. It has been determined using several samples of top events generated with different masses. The same analysis has been applied on each sample. The sensitivity of the top mass on \(M_{IJ/\Psi}\) is larger than on more classical quantities, as for example the invariant mass of the system made of

Figure 3: _Invariant mass distribution \(M_{IJ/\Psi}\), for five years of running at high luminosity._an isolated lepton and a non-isolated muon inside a b-jet (\(M_{\mu\mu}\)).

From the parameters of the linear fit shown on figure 4, one expects the uncertainties on the top mass to scale as a factor \(1/0.58\simeq 1.7\) compared to the uncertainties on \(M_{lJ/\Psi}\). Therefore, for five years of running at high luminosity, one could expect a statistical uncertainty on the top mass of approximately 0.8-0.9 GeV.

To improve the statistics, different strategies may be considered. For example, one could remove the requirement of a non-isolated muon in the b-jet decay of the other top and determine the top quarks decay topology by jet charge measurements. In this way, the event sample would increase by a factor of ten. Also, preliminary studies have been performed to detect \(b\longrightarrow J/\Psi\longrightarrow e^{+}e^{-}\) decays [6]. Nevertheless, further study is needed to evaluate the effectiveness of these approaches.

## 4 Background processes

The cross section of the signal process \(pp\longrightarrow\bar{t}t\longrightarrow\bar{b}Xl\nu b\) is of the order of 350 pb (\(833\times BR_{1}=833\times 0.42\simeq 350\)). One searches for a final state which includes one isolated lepton and two b-jets.

Possible background processes include W+jets, Z+jets and boson pair production, are discussed briefly below. A deeper study of processes involving \(b\bar{b}\) production has been performed.

**W + jets process:** depending on the decay channel of the W, the final state is characterized by either three jets (\(\sigma\simeq 2.4\times 10^{4}\) pb) or one isolated lepton plus a jet (\(\sigma\simeq 7.8\times 10^{3}\) pb). Taking into account that the cross-sections of these two processes are not huge compared to

Figure 4: _Correlation between \(M_{lJ/\Psi}\) and the top mass._

the signal cross-section, and that all the final states have a different signature with respect to the signal final state, we can safely conclude without a detailed analysis that the W+jets background process can be neglected.

**Z + jets process:** here, the final state is characterized either by 3 jets (\(\sigma\simeq 9.2\times 10^{3}\) pb), or by 2 isolated leptons plus a jet (\(\sigma\simeq 590\) pb), or by one jet. For the same reason given above, the Z+jets background process can also be neglected.

**Boson pair production:**

WW: the total cross-section is of the order of 71 pb. Again the WW decays give a different signature, and this background process can be neglected.

WZ: this process with \(W\longrightarrow l\nu\) and \(Z\longrightarrow b\bar{b}\) gives the same signature as the signal. However the corresponding cross-section is very small: \(\sigma\simeq 1\) pb. Therefore, this process can be neglected as well.

ZZ: the total cross-section is \(\sigma\simeq 9\) pb. The cross-section for Z decays leading to a similar final state as for the signal (ie \(Z_{1}\longrightarrow l^{+}l^{-}\) and \(Z_{2}\longrightarrow b\bar{b}\)) would be negligible compared to the signal cross-section.

**Inclusive \(b\bar{b}\) process:** the total cross-section for inclusive \(b\bar{b}\) production is of the order of 500 \(\mu b\), a factor \(\simeq 10^{6}\) larger than the signal cross-section. The final state, made of 2 b-jets, is simply missing one isolated lepton compared to the signal final state. A priori, in \(b\bar{b}\) production, events with one isolated lepton will occur very rarely. Nevertheless, taking into account the very large cross-section, at which level does it occur compared to the signal events rate? An attempt is made in the following to answer this question.

Taking into account the different branching ratios (\(BR_{2}\) for \(b\longrightarrow J/\Psi\longrightarrow\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\), and \(BR_{3}\) for \(\bar{b}\longrightarrow\mu^{+}\)) one can expect of the order of \(3.5\times 10^{9}\)\(b\bar{b}\) events with three non-isolated muons per year at high luminosity, as compared to \(2.7\times 10^{3}\) signal events.

It is not possible to force all the decay channels in the Monte Carlo. Only the \(J/\Psi\) decay into two muons has been forced. Therefore, \(10^{9}\)\(b\bar{b}\) events have been generated, out of which \(10^{6}\) events contained three non-isolated muons. These \(10^{6}\) events were passed through ATLFAST.

The efficiencies for the various cuts are presented in table 1. For the sake of clarity, the following cuts are defined as:

- cut 1: one isolated lepton with \(p_{T}>3\)\(GeV\) and \(|\eta|<2.4\).

- cut 2: one isolated lepton with \(p_{T}>30\)\(GeV\) and \(|\eta|<2.4\).

- cut 3: three non-isolated muons with \(p_{T}>3\)\(GeV\) and \(|\eta|<2.4\).

- cut 4: cut 2 \(\times\) cut 3. This is the cut applied for event selection.

- cut 5: \(p_{T}^{miss}>20\)\(GeV\).

Of over \(10^{6}\)\(b\bar{b}\) events generated with three non-isolated muons, only 2.9% survive the kinematical cuts (cut 3). In 35.4% of the cases, an isolated lepton is reconstructed (cut 1) and in 0.05% of the cases with a tighter cut (cut 2). Nevertheless, no events survive after the nominal cuts (cut 4). In addition, one could also apply a cut on the missing transverse energy (cut 5) which would reduces the \(b\bar{b}\) rate by a factor of 6 and has practically no impact on the signal rate.

In order to obtain the number of events per year at high luminosity which pass the cuts, one would have to apply a factor of 3500. One event passing the nominal cuts would be the equivalent of 3500 per year, which is approximately a factor of ten higher than the number of signal events (430). No \(b\bar{b}\) events have passed the nominal cuts. In addition, the cut on the transverse missing energy lowers the \(b\bar{b}\) rate by a factor of 6. Moreover, the \(lJ/\Psi\) invariant mass distribution of remaining \(b\bar{b}\) events that would pass the cuts would not be likely shaped as the signal which would further reduce the signal over background ratio in a mass window around \(M_{lJ/\Psi}\).

Although more statistic would be helpful, the \(b\bar{b}\) background process can probably be controlled.

\(Wb\bar{b}\) **process:** this process has exactly the same final state as the signal. The cross-sections, for \(W\longrightarrow l\nu\) (with \(l=e\ or\mu\)) are of the order of 85 pb [7]. Therefore, at production level, the signal over background ratio is of the order of 4 (\(S/B\simeq 4.12\)).

For this study, \(10^{8}\)\(Wb\bar{b}\) events have been generated using the Monte Carlo described in [7]. \(1.64\times 10^{5}\) contained one isolated lepton and three non-isolated muons. Only \(1.9\times 10^{3}\) passed the nominal cuts, leading to a reconstruction efficiency of 1.2% (compared to 16% for the signal).

Therefore, after selection cuts, the signal over background ratio would be: \(S/B\simeq 4.12\times 16/1.2\simeq 55\). This background process can also be neglected.

**Conclusion:** it has been shown that all the background processes are either negligible or can be kept under control.

## 5 Systematic uncertainties

The advantage of this method relies on the fact that the top mass can determined with a smaller systematic uncertainty with respect to the case of using other techniques. For example, here the top mass does not depend on the jet energy scale which is one the main sources of systematics in the lepton plus jets channel [8].

However, the measurement of the top mass will be limited by how well the Monte Carlo describes the top production and decay. For example, the proper parametrization of the b-quark fragmentation is particulary important.

A non-exhaustive study of the systematic uncertainties is presented in the following and is based on the analysis carried out in [2]. Shifts of \(M_{lJ/\Psi}\) are determined as the difference

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{l c c c c c} \hline \hline Cuts & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 \\ \hline Efficiency (\%) & 35.4 & 0.05 & 2.9 & - & 16.7 \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 1: _Efficiencies for \(b\bar{b}\) process as a function of cuts._between the value of \(M_{lJ/\Psi}\) under the nominal conditions and the value of \(M_{lJ/\Psi}\) under the particular conditions of the systematic uncertainty source under study. The errors on the mass shifts are statistical errors and come from the sample of events used to determine the mass shifts.

**Initial State Radiation:**

Switching off initial state radiation leads to a mass shift \(\Delta M_{lJ/\Psi}=0.1\pm 0.3\) GeV.

**Parton Distribution Function:**

The default set of parton distribution function used in this analysis is CTEQ2L. Another sample of events have been generated with CTEQ2M. The resulting mass shift is \(\Delta M_{lJ/\Psi}=0.2\pm 0.3\) GeV.

**b-quark fragmentation parameter \(\epsilon_{b}\):**

The b-quark fragmentation is described by the Peterson fragmentation function [9]. As default value, \(\epsilon_{b}=0.005\) has been used. Two mass shifts have been obtained by varying the default value of \(\epsilon_{b}=0.005\) by \(\pm 10\%\)[10]. The value of both mass shifts is \(\Delta M_{lJ/\Psi}=+0.4/0.0\pm 0.3\) GeV.

In addition, two other samples have been generated, by varying the default value of \(\epsilon_{b}\) by \(\pm 20\%\). The value of both mass shifts is \(\Delta M_{lJ/\Psi}=+0.8/+0.1\pm 0.3\) GeV.

**Top transverse momentum dependence:**

The stability of \(M_{lJ/\Psi}\) as a function of \(p_{T}(top)\) has been checked. As shown on the left plot of figure 5, a strong \(p_{T}(top)\) dependence is observed.

Figure 5: _Left plot: Dependence of the reconstructed \(M_{lJ/\Psi}\) on the top quark transverse momentum. Right plot: Dependence of \(M_{lJ/\Psi}\) on the top quark transverse momentum, at generator level and for various sets of event selection criteria._

To identify the origin of this dependence, the same analysis has been performed at generator level. This study has been repeated using different selection criteria (as shown in the right plot of figure 5):

1- no cut applied.

2- cut on isolated lepton only.

3- cut on non-isolated muons only.

4- all cuts applied.

One can see that no dependence is observed when no cuts are applied. The cut on non-isolated muons introduces a small dependence. The dependence is mainly coming from the cut requiring an isolated lepton.

This effect is a kinematic one, which can be kept under control as long as the Monte Carlo is well tuned to the data.

The mass shifts are summarized in table 2. The statistical uncertainty on all mass shifts is 0.3 GeV.

The \(lJ/\Psi\) invariant mass can be determined with a systematic error of the order of 0.5 GeV which translates to a systematic error on the top mass determination of the order of 1 GeV.

## 6 Conclusion

The top mass quark can be precisely determined in leptonic final states with a \(J/\Psi\). In this analysis, it has been shown that this method relies heavily on the proper Monte Carlo description of top production and decay. A systematic uncertainty on the top quark mass of the order of 1 GeV seems achievable. However, this channel may be statistically limited since the expected statistical uncertainty is of the order of 0.8-0.9 GeV for 5 years of running at high luminosity.
