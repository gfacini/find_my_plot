## Top production at LHC

The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is a proton-proton collider with 14 TeV centre of mass energy and design luminosity of 10\({}^{34}\) cm-2s-1.

fb-1 of integrated luminosity are expected to be collected in one year of data taking at the initial low (10\({}^{33}\)) luminosity and 100 fb-1 for one year of data taking at the nominal one.

### Studies for the low luminosity period of LHC will be presented

The W\(\rightarrow\)jj was reconstructed from the non-b jets. The combination with closest invariant mass to m\({}_{\rm W}\) was selected. Events with \(|\)m\({}_{\rm jj}\)- m\({}_{\rm W}\)\(|\)\(<\) 20 GeV were kept. The W candidate was then combined with the b-jet which gives the highest p\({}_{\rm T}\) for the reconstructed top.

**Top quark decays and couplings**

* **This prediction can be checked by searching for t\(\rightarrow\)WX (t\(\rightarrow\)bX) decays.*
* Measure the ratio of ttbar events with a double b-tag (lepton-tag) to single b-tag (lepton-tag).*
* LHC will provide enough statistics for this measurement, but the systematic errors will be dominated by the uncertainties in the b-tagging (lepton) efficiency and fake rates.**
* Can be checked also by measuring the top quark rare decays, especially the Flavor Changing Neutral Current (FCNC) ones.

# FCNC rare decays

**Provides the only means to directly measure the CKM matrix element \(\rm V_{tb}\) at LHC and thereby explore the properties and nature of the Wtb vertex.**

**Provides an opportunity to study the polarization of top quarks (\(\sim\)100% polarized at LO) as well as of the W bosons produced in top decays (\(\sim\)70% longitudinally polarized).**

**Can provide an independent measurement of the top quark mass and may probe FCNC**Single Top Production (cont.)

In order to reduce the enormous QCD multi-jet backgrounds and to provide a high \(\mathrm{p_{T}}\) lepton for trigger purposes, single top production with t\(\rightarrow\)Wb followed by a leptonic decay W\(\rightarrow\)lv (l=e,\(\mu\)) has been considered. In this decay topology main contributions to the background comes from ttbar and Wjj (specially Wbbbar) events.

Fake lepton rate, b-tag efficiency and purity, reconstruction of low energy jets, identification of forward jets are among the detector performance issues that have to be understood in detail.

## Conclusions

The large production cross-sections at the LHC for ttbar pair production and electroweak single top production imply that over the lifetime of the ATLAS experiment, samples of many millions of top quarks events will be selected. These large data sets will allow very sensitive studies of the properties of the top quark.

The mass of the top quark will be measured with a precision of \(\sim\)1 GeV, dominated entirely by systematic errors.

Rare decays of the top quark can be probed down to branching ratios as low as of order of \(10^{-4}\).

The detailed study of different mechanisms of electroweak single top production will yield a wealth of information including precision measurements of \(\rm V_{tb}\), measurement of the W and t polarizations, and searches for anomalous couplings.

And more \(\ldots\) top quark Yukawa coupling, ttbar spin correlations and CP violation, heavy resonances decaying to ttbar.
