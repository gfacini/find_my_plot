The ATLAS feedthrough assemblies are substantially simplified if the power for the amplifiers could be sent through the signal feedthroughs. That is the present design approach. However, the resistance of the Inconel pin and SAMTEC connection has not been verified as acceptable for this arrangement. We have measured the resistance of a connection through the UW feedthrough. This connection consists of the SAMTEC connector, gold plated Inconel pin and SAMTEC connector. The measurement was made by connecting 18 pins in series so the readings provide an average for the 18 pins and connections. The measurements were made both at room temperature and at liquid nitrogen temperature (in a LN bath to be exact). We also made a measurement for gold plated square brass pins instead of the Inconel pins for comparison. Measurements of the voltage drop across the series of connections were made with 1 A through the connections. The voltage drop and the calculated resistance per connection for each configuration are given in the following table.

\begin{tabular}{c c c}
**Connection** & \(\Delta\)**V (mV/18 pins)** & **R (m\(\Delta\)/pin)** \\ Inconel at Room & & 650 & 36 \\ Temperature & & 560 & 31 \\ Brass at Room & & 377 & 21 \\ Temperature & & 330 & 18 \\ \end{tabular}

Although 1 A was being carried through all 18 pins, no sign of boiling was observed after the initial cool down. Once boiling commences it will continue even at lower heat input but in this case the initial boiling just damped out. More tests should be carried out in LAr and at higher currents to find the limits of stability but this first result is encouraging.
