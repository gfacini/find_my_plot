## Introduction

This report describes the constitution, production process, and thermo-mechanical behaviour modelization of Absorbers designed for Liquid Argon End Cap Calorimeter of ATLAS. These complex corrugated plates have linearly variable amplitude of corrugation (equivalent to linearly variable angle of folding) constituting a kind of" helical corrugated" shape.

We won't describe the perfect shape design of these absorbers, but the way to produce and to modelize them with dimensions and shapes established for the time being. (see Note LARG-004)

A first prototype has been made in 1993, demonstrating the feasability and performances of this kind of calorimeter. The following is based on the experience acquired during production and tests of the elements of this prototype.

In ATLAS calorimeter, there are in fact two different types of absorbers. First is called _"inner wheel absorber"_, as it is designed for the near beam part of the calorimeter. Second is larger and called _"outer wheel absorber"_ for its pilling up as a wheel surrounding the inner wheel.

Absorbers Constitution

Constitution and specifications (except for length and folding angles) of the different kinds of absorbers are absolutly the same. Therefore, we won't distinguish them for constitution description, and will give separate geometrical data afterwards. (see chapter 1.6)

Absorbers are composed of six main elements :

* Lead Plates
* Prepreg
* Stainless Steel Sheets
* Edge Bars
* Structural Bars

### Lead Plates

Lead plates are made of ordinary lead, alloyed or not, providing the fact that alloy ratio is particularly regular, generating less than 1% of absorbtion variations.

Variable thickness specifications are described in Note LARG-004.

### Prepreg

Prepreg is a single layer of glass fibers tissu, impregnated with epoxy. Glass fibers function is to insure a good regularity of glue thickness, with manipulation facilities, but they have no structural functions.

For 1993 prototype, we successfully used Brochier 1454 prepreg (vicotex resin).

### Stainless Steel Sheets

 Stainless Steel Sheets are 0.2 mm thick, and play the role of structural skin for lead plate. Material should be magnetic, so 316L annealed steel is recommended.

### Edge Bars

Edge bars are inserted in place of lead (between the two prepregs) at the edges near longitudinal structural bars. Their thickness follows lead variable thickness. The purpose is to avoid nonen instrumented absorbing matter. In consequence, the material of these bars should have a large radiation radius, such as G10 composite.

### Structural Bars

Structural Bars are stiff elements, rigidly glued to the absorber. We can distinguish two different elements:

* _Longitudinal bars_, parallel to the waves, and assuming a good transfer of strength between calorimeter rings (see Note LARG-006) without strain of laminate, and a precise positioning of absorbers.

* _Transversal bars_, perpendicular to waves, and controlling complex shrinkage behaviour of corrugations.

For one absorber, there are two longitudinal bars (one front, and one back, with respect to the orientation in the calorimeter), and one transversal bar (for acute angles).

Although it is not imperative, with adequate design, longitudinal bars could probably serve for other functions :

* Edge bars (if their shape is adapted to make only one piece)
* High Voltage feeding
* Towers (three electrodes) electrical grouping

### Geometrical data

Hereafter, you will find geometrical data for three different absorbers :

* Prototype Absorbers, made for 1993 prototype calorimeter, serving as reference for process improvement and also for thermo-mechanical modelization adjustments
* Inner wheel Absorbers
* Outer wheel Absorbers

The last two are based on dimensions established for the time being, although small changes could be applied with no strong consequenses for production process, nor for modelization principle.

## 2 Production

As for constitution description, we won't distinguish inner and outer absorbers, and will only describe _general processes and tools_ for their production.

### Lead Plates production

Lead Plates are made with rolled sheets. Post-operations are the following :

* Outline cutting
* Variable thickness machining
* Cleaning
* Thickness control

#### 2.1.1 Outline cutting

Outline of plates can be cut with _"water jet" cutler_. The best way is to stack several roughly cutted lead sheets, and use abrasive water jet led by a two axis robot.

#### 2.1.2 Variable thickness machining

A large scan of possible processes has been performed.

Following technics have been examined (and tested for some of them) :

* Molding
* Rolling
* Hot Stamping
* Plasma Spraying
* Chemical Machining
* Electrolytic Machining
* Electroerosion
* Conventional Machining

Conclusion is that _Conventional Machining_ is probably the most economical and accurate method for this operation. One the main problems with lead sheets machining is to flange them on the supporting table without spoiling. A solution already tested with success at CERN is the use of vacuum fixtures.

Further tests are under process to validate the use of _diamond tools_. In fact, these expensive but unwearable tools could machine lead without any lubricant, so without any problem of cleaning after machining.

#### 2.1.3 Cleaning

In case we could not use diamond tools, for any strong reason, the use of lubricant would induce a cleaning operation. Lead plates cleaning process should remove oxyde layer to insure a good adhesion of epoxy, but should not induce any thickness or shape distortion. Ruggedness is not specified as long as it is regular, for the same reasons as thickness regularity.

For 1993 prototype, brushing with _nylon brushes_ and lubricated pumice stone powder was applied.

Another promissing technique would be _shot-peening_ with soft polymer balls.

#### 2.1.4 Thickness control

Lead thickness control is important to insure a perfect homogeneity of the calorimeter.

More than thickness, particle absorbsion should be homogeneous. For this basic specification, the use of _gamma rays absorbion_ to control thickness (or profil) of lead plates seams to be an adequate process.

_Ultrasonic_ thickness measurement is also possible with lead, and has been successfully tested at LPNHE-Paris 6 for barrel absorbers, even if this material has a quite high coefficient of attenuation of acoustic waves. Transducer should provide at least 20 MHz waves, and counter clock frequency should be at least 250 MHz for precise time of flight measurement. With these cautions, manipulation of the instrument is not very easy, but seams to be repetitive enough.

### Prepreg preparation

Prepreg should be stored at _low temperature_ (-20degC). For this reason, sandwitch preparation should be done just before gluing, and not in advance of more than a few days, otherwise all the mass of lead and steel will have to be cooled down.

### Stainless Steel Sheets preparation

After outline cutting, an operation of _chemical cleaning_ is important for good adhesion to lead with prepreg. Process used at CERN for prototypes gave good results, with perchiorethylene cleaning at 120degC and passivation with "netinox" before rinsing with demineralized water and drying.

### Edge bars

For 1993 prototype, these bars were made of glass epoxy G10 composite. It should be noted that there is no strong specification of stiffness for these bars.

One other possibility would be to merge edge bars with longitudinal structural bars. The feasibility of this hybrid-bar is not yet established, but this method is being further examined as it could reduce the number of gluing operations.

### Structural Bars production

For 1993 prototype, longitudinal structural bars were made of glass epoxy composite, rectified at bevelled faces to ensure a good geometry of the stack. There was no transversal structural bar.

As modelization shown us that absorber weight carrying was not necessary all along the bars, it is better to index positions of the absorbers only at the level of structural rings. In this case, we don't need expensive rectification operation.

Both longitudinal and transversal bars could be made of _Liquid Cristals Polymer_ stiffened with short glass fibers, like B130 VECTRA. This kind of material can be economically injected in metal moulds.

### Sandwich folding

Before folding, steel/prepreg/lead/prepreg/steel sandwich should be stacked on a table, with a master form to ensure a good overlay of successive plates.

Folding press is an ordinary press, equiped with a special folder called "_crocodile folder"_. The principle of this type of "waves folder" has been developped for the first barrel calorimeter prototype. For End Cap prototype, it was modified for the use of special blades with helical shape, fitting continuously varying values of both folding angle and lead thickness.

### Sandwich gluing

Gluing operation is realised in a press with _hot dies_, assuming the right shape to final absorber. These dies are made by juxtaposition of "elementary blades", machined with the same process (four axes numerically controlled milling machine) as "folder blades" (see Figure 5).

Temperature and pressure of press should be adapted to prepreg specifications. In the case of Brochier 1454 prepreg, we experimented good results with a stage of about half an hour at 135\({}^{\circ}\)C and 5 bars.

Figure 5: _Hot press used for prototype absorbers_

### Helix shape control

Cooling phase of gluing process induces shrinkage of corrugations, especially for acute angles. This geometrical deficiency is fortunately repetitive, and there is few argon gap thickness dispersion if it is taken into account for die blades design.

Anyway, it is important to evaluate this kind of sandwich shape defect before next operations, in order to reject those presenting a particularly important divergence.

A method for this control could simply be a scan with _optical proximity sensor_ (triangulation type), for a few specific sections of the absorbers, perpendicularly to corrugation.

### Bars gluing

Structural bars should be glued to absorbers with a lot of care. In fact, the precision of this operation will induce the precision of absorbers piling up.

For this reason, we will use a _master form_ based, once more, on helical blades similar to folder's.

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:14]

Likewise, we have for lead and prepreg:

\[\alpha_{{}_{prepreg}}=10.5\times 10^{-5}mm/mm/^{\circ}K\]

\[\alpha_{{}_{lead}}=2.74\times 10^{-5}mm/mm/^{\circ}K\]

### Accurate models

The absorbers are modeled with the FEA-programme SYSTUS. Elements adopted are 4 nodes _stratifie_ elements. These linear elements have a constant thickness, thus models must be formed with five side by side constant thickness parts.

The model is built with 680, 987 and 819 elements for prototype (8 waves), inner (11 waves) and outer (9 waves) absorbers, and 735, 920 and 760 nodes respectively.

4 & 1.80 & 2.00 & 1.90 & 2.60 \\
5 & 2.00 & 2.20 & 2.10 & 2.80 \\ \hline \end{tabular}

### Rough models

To take into account that both coefficient of thermal expansion and stiffness of the absorbers change along radial axis of the calorimeter, at least two elements are adopted for the rough model. On the other side, absorber bending can be reproduced with one element (along the beam axis), only if it is a _quadratic_ element.

### Mechanical analysis of prototype absorber

Some spare variable height accordions absorbers from 1993 prototype are tested and analysed to give generic data for stiffness of corrugated sandwichs.

#### 3.4.1 Measurement

In order to determine the stiffness in the cross waves direction, traction tests have been done.

\(\bullet\)Traction test along optuse angles Figure 8 shows the Load-Displacement plot. The plastic zone is reached for a 440 N load, the elastic maximum displacement is 1.8 mm.

Figure 7: _Inner absorber rough model_

\(\bullet\)Dead load

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|} \hline \multicolumn{2}{|c|}{Deflection} \\ \hline optuse angles & -4.1 mm \\ acute angles & -4.9 mm \\ \hline \end{tabular}

Edge effect is very important for these elements. Calculated displacements for optuse and acute angles with rough model are similar, because the number of quadratic elements is not enough, and elements are too much lofty in the direction transversal to corrugation.

However, this model is preserved as compromise between accuracy and simplicity (low number of nodes).

### Mechanical analysis of inner absorber

#### 3.5.1 Computation with accurate model

Mechanical properties are the same as prototype absorber accurate model.

\(\bullet\)Traction tests

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|} \hline Displacement & \\ \hline optuse angles & 0.96 mm \\ acute angles & 2.90 mm \\ mean value & 1.93 mm \\ \hline \end{tabular}

\(\bullet\)Dead load

Although the mass is smaller for the small thickness of lead, the deflection is more important for acute angles than for optuse angles. Indeed, bending inertia is proportional to the cube of lead thickness and to the square of distance from sandwitch middle plan to steel sheet.

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|} \hline \multicolumn{2}{|c|}{Deflection} \\ \hline optuse angles & -6.9 mm \\ acute angles & -7.4 mm \\ \hline \end{tabular}

#### 3.5.2 Equivalent Young's modulus and thickness

The Young's modulus and thickness which allow to obtained acceptable results are shown in the table below:

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|} \hline E\({}_{\mathit{Lwav}}\) & 2.6 N/mm\({}^{2}\) \\ E\({}_{\mathit{lwav}}\)(*) & 1,795 N/m\({}^{2}\) \\ G\({}_{\mathit{l1}}\) & 1 N/mm\({}^{2}\) \\ \(\nu\) & 0.3 \\ inner element thickness & 48 mm \\ outer element thickness & 62 mm \\ \hline \end{tabular}

\({}^{(*)}\)E\({}_{\mathit{lwav}}\) is calculated by homogeneous:

\[E_{\mathit{lwav}}=\frac{\sum(thickness\times E)}{totalthickness}\]

\[E_{\mathit{lwav}}=\frac{0.4\times 186,390+0.3\times 19,620+1.33\times 13,734}{ 2.03}\]

\[E_{\mathit{lwav}}=48,624N/m\mathit{m}^{2}\]

\[E_{\mathit{lwav}}=E_{\mathit{lwav}}\frac{2.03}{5.5}=1,795N/m\mathit{m}^{2}\]where \(1.33=\) lead mean thickness in mm,

and \(2.03=\) total mean thickness in mm

\[\{\epsilon\}=\left[\begin{array}{ccccc}557.1\times 10^{-6}&-167.1\times 10^{-6}&-1 67.1\times 10^{-6}&0&0&0\\ &0.385&-0.1154&0&0&0\\ &0.385&0&0&0\\ &&&1&0&0\\ &&&&1&0\\ &&&&1.\end{array}\right]\{\sigma\}\]

#### 3.5.3 Computation with rough model

\(\bullet\)Traction tests

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|} \hline Displacement \\ \hline optuse angles & 3.7 mm \\ acute angles & 3.7 mm \\ \hline \end{tabular} Edge effect is also very important for these elements.

\(\bullet\) Dead load

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|} \hline Deflection \\ \hline optuse angles & -6.7 mm \\ acute angles & -7.2 mm \\ \hline \end{tabular}

#### 3.5.4 Computation with rough model with transversal bar

In order to control shrinkage behaviour of corrugations, transversal bars are fixed along acute angles of absorbers.

Injection process will be studied to allow a moderate orientation of fibers, and an adjustment of longitudinal coefficient of thermal expansion similar to aluminum's one.

Geometrical characteristics of transversal bars are shown in the table below:

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|} \hline \(L\)\(\times\)\(l\) (mm\({}^{2}\) & \(S\)(mm\({}^{2}\) & \(I\)1 (mm\({}^{4}\)) & \(I\)2 (mm\({}^{4}\)) & \(I\)1 (mm\({}^{4}\)) \\ \hline
3 \(\times\) 8 & 24 & 1 28 & 18 & 67 \\ \hline \end{tabular}

\(\bullet\)Traction simulation results become :

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|} \hline Displacement \\ \hline optuse angles & 0.4 mm \\ acute angles & 0.33 mm \\ \hline \end{tabular}

Remarks : Elongation of transversal bar alone is :

\[\sigma=E\epsilon\] \[\frac{F}{S}=E\frac{\Delta L}{L}\] \[\Delta L=\frac{FL}{SE}=\frac{385\times 540}{24\times 71,\,000}\] \[\Delta L=0.12\,m\,m\]

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|} \hline \multicolumn{2}{|c|}{Deflection} \\ \hline opt use angles & -6.9 mm \\ acute angles & -7.4 mm \\ \hline \end{tabular}

#### 3.6.2 Equivalent Young's modulus and thickness

Young's modulus and thickness for acceptable results are shown in the table below:

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|} \hline \multicolumn{2}{|c|}{E\({}_{\lfloor w\,w\,e}\)} & 1.2 N/mm\({}^{2}\) \\ E\({}_{\lfloor w\,w\,e}\)(*) & 1,385 N/mm\({}^{2}\) \\ G\({}_{\downarrow\,\downarrow}\) & 1 N/mm\({}^{2}\) \\ \(\nu\) & 0.3 \\ inner element thickness & 72 mm \\ outer element thickness & 80 mm \\ \hline \end{tabular}

\({}^{(*)}\)E\({}_{\lfloor w\,w\,e}\) is calculated by homogeneousisation:

\[E_{\lfloor w\,w\,e}=\frac{\sum(thickness\times E)}{totalthickness}\]

\[E_{\lfloor w\,w\,e}=\frac{0.4\times 186,390+0.3\times 19,620+1.705\times 13, 734}{2.405}\]

\[E_{\lfloor w\,w\,e}=43,1\,83N/mm^{2}\]

\[E_{\lfloor w\,w\,e}=E_{\lfloor w\,w\,e}=2.405\over 76}=1,385N/m\,m^{2}\]

where 1.705 = lead mean thickness in mm, and 2.405 = total mean thickness in mm

\[\{\epsilon\}=\left[\begin{array}{ccccc}722.0\times 10^{-\,6}&-216.6\times 1 0^{-\,6}&-216.6\times 10^{-\,6}&0&0&0\\ &0.833&-0.25&0&0&0\\ &0.833&0&0&0\\ &&&1&0&0\\ &&&2.1\,67\end{array}\right]\{\sigma\}\]

#### 3.6.4 Computation with rough model with transversal bar

For the same reasons as inner absorber, extra transversal bar is added.

\(\bullet\)Traction results become :

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|} \hline \multicolumn{2}{|c|}{Displacement} \\ \hline optuse angles & 0.71 mm \\ acute angles & 0.35 mm \\ \hline \end{tabular}

Remark :

Edge effect is not perceptible for this outer absorbers geometry.

Elements are loftier than forinner absorber elements. Deflection for optuse and acute angles are different.

\(\bullet\) Dead load

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|} \hline \multicolumn{2}{|c|}{Deflection} \\ \hline optuse angles & -6.8 mm \\ acute angles & -7.3 mm \\ \hline \end{tabular}

### Thermo-mechanical analysis of prototype absorber

#### 3.7.1 Measurement

Cold measurements of prototype absorber have been performed to adjust coefficients of thermal expansion of corrugated sandwitchs.

The absorber is immerged in a tank filled with Liquid Nitrogen. A composite stick with aluminum tip, driven by a 3 D robot, and plunging in Liquid Nitrogen, traces the zig-zag profiles of optuse and acute angles.

#### 3.7.2 Computation with accurate model

An artificial numerical correction is applied to coefficients of thermal expansion to simulate "spring effects" at the level of folding.

Hypothetically, the variation of this coefficient along edges is linear and similar for each material. Thus, we obtain:

\begin{tabular}{|c|c||c|c||c|c|} \hline  & & \(\perp\) wave & \(\perp\) wave & \(\parallel\) wave & \(\parallel\) wave \\ \hline _Part_ & \(initial\) & _corrective_ & _artificial_ & _corrective_ & _artificial_ \\  & _expansion_ & _coefficient_ & _expansion_ & _coefficient_ & _expansion_ \\  & _coefficient_ & & _coefficient_ & & _coefficient_ \\  & _(10\({}^{-5\,6}\) K\({}^{-1}\))_ & & _(10\({}^{-5\,6}\) K\({}^{-1}\))_ & & _(10\({}^{-5\,6}\) K\({}^{-1}\))_ \\ \hline
1 & & & & & \\ steel & 1.37 & 4.00 & 5.48 & 0.292 & 0.40 \\ prepreg & 10.5 & & 42.00 & & 3.07 \\ lead & 2.74 & & 10.96 & & 0.80 \\ \hline
2 & & & & & \\ steel & 1.37 & 3.50 & 4.80 & 0.292 & 0.40 \\ prepreg & 10.5 & & 36.75 & & 3.07 \\ lead & 2.74 & & 9.59 & & 0.80 \\ \hline
3 & & & & & \\ steel & 1.37 & 3.00 & 4.11 & 0.292 & 0.40 \\ prepreg & 10.5 & & 31.50 & & 3.07 \\ lead & 2.74 & & 8.22 & & 0.80 \\ \hline
4 & & & & & \\ steel & 1.37 & 2.50 & 3.42 & 0.292 & 0.40 \\ prepreg & 10.5 & & 26.25 & & 3.07 \\ lead & 2.74 & & 6.85 & & 0.80 \\ \hline
5 & & & & & \\ steel & 1.37 & 2.00 & 2.74 & 0.292 & 0.40 \\ prepreg & 10.5 & & 21.00 & & 3.07 \\ lead & 2.74 & & 5.48 & & 0.80 \\ \hline \end{tabular}

We can see that "spring effect" is much more important for acute angles (first parts) than forpotuse angles (last parts).

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|} \hline  & _hol_ & _cold_ & _contraction_ & _initial_ & _final_ \\  & _measure_ & _measure_ & _observed_ & _contraction_ & _contraction_ \\  & _(mm)_ & _(mm)_ & _(mm)_ & _calculated_ & _calculated_ \\  & & & & _(mm)_ & _(correction)_ \\ \hline _acute angle_ & 4 77.7 & 470.8 & -6.9 & -2.3 & -7.0 \\ _obtuse angle_ & 4 77.7 & 474.8 & -2.9 & -2.2 & -3.0 \\ _waves_ & 5 60.0 & 558.4 & -1.6 & -2.7 & -1.8 \\ \hline \end{tabular}

These corrections of coefficients of thermal expansion will be applied to inner and outer absorbers accurate models.

#### 3.7.3 Computation with rough model

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|} \hline \multicolumn{2}{|c|}{Contraction} \\ \hline optuse angles & 5.0 mm \\ acute angles & 5.0 mm \\ \(\parallel\)\(waves\) & 1.6 mm \\ \hline \end{tabular}

An important edge effect is observed for thermo-mechanical simulations of prototype absorber, artificially eliminating contraction difference between optuse and acute angles. The value 5.0 mm corresponds to the mean value of accurate model (3.0 mm and 7.0 mm).

### Thermo-mechanical analysis of inner absorber

#### 3.8.1 Computation with accurate model

Thermal properties are the same as prototype accurate model.

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|} \hline \multicolumn{2}{|c|}{Contraction} \\ \hline optuse angles & 3.9 mm \\ acute angles & 9.5 mm \\ \(\parallel\)\(waves\) & 1.3 mm \\ \hline \end{tabular}

#### 3.8.2 Computation with rough model

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|} \hline \multicolumn{2}{|c|}{Contraction} \\ \hline optuse angles & 6.0 mm \\ acute angles & 6.0 mm \\ \(\parallel\)\(waves\) & 1.3 mm \\ \hline \end{tabular}

As for rough prototype absorber, an important edge effect is observed for thermo-mechanical simulation of inner absorber elements. The value 6.0 mm corresponds to the mean value of accurate model (3.6 mm and 8.4 mm).

#### 3.8.3 Computation with rough model with transversal bar

Stress induced by transversal bare enhances longitudinal contraction of the artificial absorber by "coefficient of Poisson effect".
