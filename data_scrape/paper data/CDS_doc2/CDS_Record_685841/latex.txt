## 1 Introduction

**This note gives a brief overview of the estimated amount of material we expect in the tracker region of Eagle, as a function of rapidity. All numbers used are based on private communication with members of the involved detector R & D groups and are taken at an intermediate stage of the design. The moderator material is not taken into account. In section 2 we discuss briefly the effect of material on the tracker performance; section 3 describes the detectors as defined for the calculation, and in the last section the results are presented.**

## 2 The effect of material on tracking

**Any material inside (and before) the tracking region distorts the identification and momentum measurement of electrons, through the following processes:**

* **The conversion of** \(\gamma\) **to an** \(e^{+}e^{-}\) **pair, giving rise to an electronlike signal, i.e. an electron track matching an electromagnetic cluster;**
* **catastrophic energy loss (Bremsstrahlung) of an electron. This broadens the cluster in the calorimeter, thus weakening isolation cuts, and degrades the track-cluster match in both position and E/p balance. This may lead to trigger inefficiencies.**
* **showing of a particle can lead to multiple hits around the actual track, giving rise to ambiguities;*** inaddition, multiple scattering limits the precision of other particles for \(p_{t}\leq 50\) GeV, with consequent degradation of the physics for e.g. \(Z^{*}\rightarrow\mu\mu\).

For both conversion backgrounds and catastrophic energy loss, we are most troubled by the _amount_ of material upto (and including) the sagitta measurement. Further out, the _radial distribution_ is of equal importance, as shown in transparency copies DICE-TR-030. More sophisticated studies on the effect of material on electron identification are being pursued by the RD2 collaboration.

## 3 Description of the detectors

In this note, we use geometries that are fully equivalent to those described in Eagle note [INDET-NO-001], apart from details in the design of the TRD. The exact coordinates of all detector elements can be found in that note; figs. 1a, 2a and 3a give an \((r,z)\) view of the layouts. For detectors other than the TRD, we have put all the material in the sensitive region. In reality, these detectors will be enclosed by some box (for cooling in case of the Si and GaAs detectors, for the drift gas in the case of the MSGCs), and all other material like supports will certainly not be located at the positions of the sensitive area of the detectors. For the global plot of material vs. \(\eta\) however, this should not make an essential difference.

Table 1 gives the thicknesses used for each detector, and the number of layers and superlayers. All detector elements were positioned either horizontally or vertically in the \((r,z)\) view, so the effective thickness at a given angle of incidence \(\theta\) is always the given thickness divided by a factor sin\(\theta\) (horizontal planes) or cos\(\theta\) (vertical planes), apart from the TRD electronics where we used different approximations. The following assumptions were input:

* The beampipe The beampipe is taken to be 0.5% X\({}_{0}\) at perpendicular incidence, corresponding to 1.8 mm Be.
* The Silicon Vertex Detector (SITV) The Silicon Vertex detector (Football) consists of three double-layers of Si detectors. For the central and outer shells of the Football we have assumed 0.75% X\({}_{0}\) per monolayer, being 0.32% X\({}_{0}\) for a 300 \(\mu\)_m_thick silicon substrate plus about the same amount for all supports, electronics, cooling etc. For the innermost superlayer, we expect a bit less material so we used a total thickness of 1.0% X\({}_{0}\) for this superlayer. To avoid cracks, the wafers in one superlayer overlap. Therefore the total thickness of the football is more than the numerical sum of the three layers, even at \(\eta\) = 0.
* The GaAs detectors Each GaAs ring consists of three double-layers of GaAs detectors. For each single layer we have assumed about 0.7% X\({}_{0}\). That way we arrive at 4.2% X\({}_{0}\) perring.
* **The Micro Strip Gas Counters All Micro Strip Gas Counters(MSGCs) are regarded as thin vertical monolayers of 0.7% X\({}_{0}\) each. The glass substrates of these devices are 300 \(\mu\)_m_ thick, which corresponds to 0.24% X\({}_{0}\), and we estimate all supports, electronics, cooling etc. to amount to twice this thickness. If the \(r\)-coordinate needs a more accurate measurement and the MSGCs are positioned in small angle stereo (see INDET-NO-006), the amount of material will probably increase, with at most a factor 1.4 (a wheel with 2 MSGCs in small angle stereo is estimated to be 1% X\({}_{0}\) thick, instead of 0.7% X\({}_{0}\)).
* **The Outer Silicon detector The Outer Silicon detectors in the outer barrel region are 2.0 % X\({}_{0}\) each. All three superlayers contain 2 layers of Si wafers.
* **The Transition Radiation Detector The TRD geometry is an attempt to merge the TRD geometry as proposed by P. Nevskiat the 17 February, 1992 Eagle inner tracker meeting, with the old TRD setup (as described in INDET-NO-001). The forward part of the TRD has a varying distance between straw layers. This way the amount of material crossed by a stiff particle is almost independent of the rapidity of the particle. The inner radius of the TRD is 40 cm, the outer radius is 95 cm, its sensitive volume running from \(r=42.5\) cm to \(r=92.5\) cm. Its length in \(z\) is 2\(\times\) 370 cm; the barrel goes out to \(z=60\) cm, with the forward TRD starting at \(z=64\) cm. The barrel consists of 62 layers of radiator + straws, 0.82 cm apart, being 0.115% X\({}_{0}\) each. In the forward TRD, there are 70 layers of radiator + straws 0.8 cm apart, 70 more layers 1.6 cm apart, and the last 58 layers are 2.4 cm apart. The radiation thickness of each forward layer is 0.10% X\({}_{0}\). Support, cooling, etc. are positioned at the end of the straws. Therefore, in addition to the material in the radiators and the straws, we defined two cylinders and one disc of material: one cylinder inside the TRD, at \(r=40\) cm, one cylinder outside the TRD at \(r=95\) cm, and one disc at \(z=62\) cm (the end of the barrel straws). The disc is 2% X\({}_{0}\) thick. The cylinders are taken to be 1% X\({}_{0}\) (inner) and 4% X\({}_{0}\) (outer) in the barrel. it is however not probable that the thickness of these cylinders will be the same everywhere along \(z\) in the forward part, because the disc density decreases with \(z\). We therefore assumed half of the cylinder thickness to scale with 1/sin\(\theta\), and the other half to remain constant.

## 4 Results

Figures 1a, 2a and 3a show (\(r,z\)) views of the three setups. In figs. 1b, 2b and 3b we plotted the amount of material encountered in the setup as a function of \(\eta\). For each setup, the total material thickness and the contribution of each detector are drawn. For all curves, an average has been calculated over all possible vertex positions (in \(z\)).

However, this representation is not complete: in these graphs no attention has been paid to the fact that material close to the beampipe will be a more important cause of problems than material close to the electromagnetic calorimeter. For this reason, in figs. 4, 5 and 6 we plotted the amount of material that a particle has encountered when it has travelled to a radius R, for four benchmark values of \(\eta\). In these plots we can see at which radius the bulk of the material is positioned and this makes comparison of the three trackers designs more fair.

The plots show that there is no significant difference between the Reference setup and the Hollow Tracker whatsoever. We can therefore reduce the discussion to differences between the Reference setup and Eagle-B. From the plots, it is clear that the TRD and the SIT contribute most to the amount of material in the tracker. It should be noted that the 2% X\({}_{\parallel}\) permolayer quoted by the SIT group is very conservative, and secondly, that both these detectors are positioned relatively outward in \(r\).

The Football is obviously too thick at high \(\eta\). This comes partly from the way we defined the Football in the program, putting all material in horizontal planes.
