[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:1]

\(E_{T}^{miss}\) measurement is also needed in physics channels involving an \(E_{T}^{miss}\) signature, as in the Higgs sector (\(H\to ZZ\to\ l^{+}l^{-}\nu\,\overline{\nu}\)), and the SUSY sector, as for example the decay of a gluino pair into n jets and associated \(E_{T}^{miss}\).
* Direct jet measurements (both in energy and direction) are needed in processes involving \(WW\) fusion in which outgoing quarks are producing jets at very small angles. This is the case in the heavy Higgs sector for \(H(1\ TeV)\to\ WW\to\ l\ \nu\ jet\ jet\) or \(H\to\ ZZ\to llll\) where in addition \(tag\) jets are produced in the Forward Calorimeter. It should be stressed that in all the physics processes mentioned, a reliable \(E_{T}^{miss}\) or forward jet measurement is essential to reject the huge QCD backgrounds.
* The FCAL should also be able to provide, in conjunction with the other calorimeters, an input for a first level trigger for SUSY searches, where the first level trigger would require 3 jets and \(E_{T}^{miss}\) above some threshold of \(\sim 100\) GeV.

#### 1.2.2 Forward Calorimeter Parameters

We address the physics requirements with respect to the following parameters. The first is the \(\eta\) coverage, including the critical endcap-forward transition region. The energy resolution for electrons and pions, or directly for jets is an important issue, and is parametrized as \(\sigma/E=a\oplus b/\sqrt{E}\). The segmentation, both lateral and in depth, plays a role in the direction reconstruction. Finally we address the speed of the detector, determining the amount of pile-up that has to be with stood.

#### 1.2.3 Requirements from Various Processes

* \(A^{0},H^{0}\to\ \tau^{+}\tau^{-}\) In this channel where at least one \(\tau\) decays semi-leptonically, the FCAL plays an essential role in the measurement of the transverse momentum carried by neutrinos and thus allows one to measure the \(A^{0}\) mass. As shown in [1], the dominant effect on the mass resolution is the \(\eta\) coverage which should extend to \(\sim 5\). The energy resolution of the FCAL is not critical. Both pile-up and noise have important effects, since one deals here with \(<E_{T}>\simeq 50\) GeV, so this search will be performed at low luminosity. Moreover, the understanding of the achievable \(E_{T}^{miss}\) resolution is still under study using full detector simulation.
* \(H\to\ ZZ\to\ l^{+}l^{-}\nu\,\overline{\nu}\) In this process, the average \(E_{T}^{miss}\) is equal to \(M_{Higgs}/2\), so typically above 200 GeV. Experimental background, i.e. Z+jet processes where jets are mismeasured or escape detection, dominate for \(E_{T}^{miss}\) below 150 GeV, under the condition that the \(\eta\) coverage extends at least down to 4 (see Fig. 7 in [2]). For \(E_{T}^{miss}\) above 150 GeV, the ZZ continuum background dominates. Studies at particle level [3] show that no strong requirements appear on energy resolution and granularity. The pile-up contribution for 60 minimum-bias events superimposed is limited to \(E_{T}^{miss}\) below 100 GeV. However the effect of the barrel-endcap and endcap-forward transitions should be studied realistically.
* SUSY signature : \(E_{T}^{miss}\) + n jets or \(l^{+}l^{+}\) + \(E_{T}^{miss}\) + n jets The selection of the SUSY signals requires a final state with 3 or 4 jets in conjunction with large \(E_{T}^{miss}\). The main background is from the Standard Model, and can be controlled, provided that the calorimeter coverage extends to \(\eta\sim 5\)[4]. Particle level simulations show that fake \(E_{T}^{miss}\) created by the endcap-forward crack should give no problem [5]: even under the pessimistic assumption that a jet entering the crack region is completely lost, the multi-jet contribution stays below that of the Standard Model for \(E_{T}^{miss}\) above 400 GeV, which is a typical cut used even for gluino masses of 300 GeV (Figure 1). Since one deals with large \(E_{T}^{miss}\), pile-up and energy resolution in the forward region are not an issue. Is is important however to understand how low one can cut in \(E_{T}^{miss}\) in a reliable way, i.e. on genuine \(E_{T}^{miss}\) not faked by instrumental effects. One should note that requiring no jet activity in the vicinity of the \(E_{T}^{miss}\) direction is an extra handle against experimental backgrounds. Consequently the granularity should be kept in the range \(\Delta\eta\times\Delta\phi=0.2\times 0.2\), and the constant term in the energy resolution below 10% [6].
* \(H(1~{}TeV)\to~{}WW\to~{}l~{}jet~{}jet\) Tagging jets in the forward region (i.e. for \(|\eta|\geq 2\)) is made difficult by pile-up, which creates real jets similar to the tag ones from WW fusion. Here the pile-up fluctuations completely dominate the energy resolution and one needs to apply \(E_{T}\) thresholds around 3 GeV on each cell of the FCAL (up to 40 minimum-bias events superimposed) [7]. As a consequence, there is no strong constraint on the jet energy resolution, but it is shown that the granularity should be in the region \(\Delta\eta\times\Delta\phi=0.2\times 0.2\), in order not to compromise the reconstruction of \(P_{T}^{Higgs}\). As for the previous channels a coverage down to 4.5-5 in rapidity is essential.

#### 1.2.4 Conclusions

The strongest requirement on the ATLAS Forward Calorimetry is a fiducial rapidity coverage up to \(|\eta|=4.5\). The lateral granularity should be in the range \(\Delta\eta\times\Delta\phi\leq 0.2\times 0.2\), and the energy resolution no worse than 100%/\(\sqrt{E}\oplus 10\%\). The longitudinal segmentation is not critical for the physics, but could help to achieve an improved position (angular) resolution. The integration time should be limited as much as possible, but a sensitivity up to 2 bunch-crossings seems acceptable.

To evaluate these parameters more accurately, more understanding is needed at the full simulation level, especially for the crack region.

### The Boundary Conditions

The calorimeters will have to operate in a high radiation environment. A special meeting was held on 8th September 1993 with representatives from the LHC machine at which it was agreed that, as a working hypothesis at that time, each forward calorimeter should be located around 15 m from the interaction point in order not to interfere with the endcap region and should incorporate the 40 cm diameter copper shield which protects the low-beta quadrupole from scattered particles. A consequence is that the calorimeter has to open in two halves before being lowered out of the beam region. A typical layout is shown in Figure 2. Alternative arrangements were not, however, excluded if a good case could be made.

Early in 1994, a case was made for an "integrated solution" in which the forward calorimeter is included in the endcap. The case is based on improved performance, improved muon coverage and reduced background in the muon chambers.

These two basic alternatives were therefore studied, and will be referred to respectively as the "15m" and "integrated" solutions. A variant of the 15m solution was later introduced with the calorimeter moved 2.5 m nearer to the main detector in order to clear the copper shield.

### The Options

#### 1.4.1 The 15m solution

Five options were considered initially:-

* liquid argon tubes
* liquid scintillator tubes
* high pressure gas with parallel plates
* high pressure gas tubes
* a hybrid of c) and d) with a parallel plate 'electromagnetic' section and a tube 'hadronic' section.

After discussion within the panel, a _combined gas solution_ was proposed incorporating the best features of the earlier options c), d), and e).

#### 1.4.2 The integrated solution

The integrated solution uses liquid argon in the same cryostat as the endcaps but with a different technology for the absorber.

### Method of Working

The study started with the workshop on 6th September 1993 at which the physics requirements, environmental constraints, and safety issues were also presented [8]. As for the central calorimetry, a series of questions and criticisms of each technique were raised by independent and expert members and answered in subsequent meetings. A cost and manpower study was also made, keeping in mind the need to minimize the cost while satisfying the ATLAS physics requirements and technical reliability, including safety. As all the proposals at that stage were from Russian institutions (ITEP Moscow and IHEP Protvino), visits were made to both by two independent members of the panel to carry out a cost and manpower survey as well as to examine the local manufacturing resources.

On 31 January 1994, the panel received a presentation from the Arizona group which initiated the consideration of the integrated solution. Following a further presentation on 30 March, it was decided that this represented a serious alternative, and the group was asked to provide the answers to a range of physics and practical questions including cost.

The 15m Solution

### Liquid Argon Option

#### 2.1.1 Concept

The device, proposed by ITEP, consists of liquid argon tubes embedded into an absorber matrix. This technique provides good energy and direction resolution, positional and angular uniformity of response, and time stability. Liquid argon is manifestly radiation hard. The proposed electrode structure has a fast intrinsic charge transfer time. The absorber consists of a stack of stainless steel or brass plates. Drift tubes are inserted into holes made in the plates. The holes form a hexagonal array. The tubes are arranged parallel to the beam. Inside the tubes there are charge collection rods. The desired gap between the rod and tube is maintained by a spacer. The gap and ratio of tube radius to centre-to-centre distance are provisionally set to 1 mm and 1:2.5. In the final design these parameters would have to be optimized. In particular at highest rapidity the gap might be only a few hundred microns to minimize the ion buildup. The calorimeter is divided longitudinally into electromagnetic and hadronic sections. The overall depth is 10 \(\lambda\). Groups of seven drift tubes are ganged together in the electronic readout. Low impedance transmission lines transfer the collected charge to preamps located in the warm. The signals are summed up into segments of \(\Delta\eta\times\Delta\phi=0.15\times 0.15\). The shaping circuit has a peaking time of 25 ns. The basic design parameters (at 15 m location, per side) are

* Cylinder
	* 2.5 m
	* 4.0 m
	* 0.4 m
* stainless steel/brass
* 5 %
* 10 \(m^{3}\)
* 150 tonnes
* 2 sections

* 25 ns

#### 2.1.2 R \(\&\) D Tests

To evaluate the performance, an EM prototype of the first forward calorimeter section was constructed. It has a radius of 35 mm (1.3 Moliere radii) and is 450 mm (17\(X_{0}\)) deep. A total of 29 drift tubes with 9 mm inner diameter are embedded into a stainless steel absorber matrix with centre-to-centre distance 11 mm. The liquid argon gap is 1.5 mm. The module has a sampling fraction of 8 %. It has been tested with electrons in the energy range 1-5 GeV at the ITEP accelerator. Figure 3 shows the response to 3.3 GeV electrons at different incidence angles. The distributions are almost Gaussian. A small tail towards zero amplitudes is mainly due to fake electrons. As one would expect for this type of geometry the resolution improves when the angle increases, but the deep-endence is weak. In the limited energy range the resolution at 2 degrees can be fitted as \(\frac{\sigma(E)}{E}=\frac{0.25}{VE}\oplus 0.06\oplus\frac{0.33}{E}\) in agreement with results from another LAr tube prototype built by the University of Arizona group [10] having a LAr gap of 250 microns. It was tested with electrons in the energy range 2-200 GeV. The tests demonstrated also a good position resolution ( \(<\) 1 mm for energies above 100 GeV).

### Liquid Scintillator Option

#### 2.2.1 Concept

The device, also proposed by ITEP, is basically a SPACAL-type calorimeter with a liquid scintillator circulating in hollow light guides.

The calorimeter has negligible noise, fast response (\(<\) 25 ns), light yield of about 100 photoelectrons/GeV, and e/h ratio close to unity.

#### 2.2.2 Design

The calorimeter has a modular structure. Modules are aligned parallel to the beam line. Each module consists of an absorber matrix containing eight light guides inserted into holes. For the light guides, quartz and/or high quality glass tubes are used. The whole assembly is mounted into a stainless steel container. The front end of the container has inlet and outlet pipes, the back is sealed by a glass window followed by a light mixer and PM. Signals from several PMs are combined into read-out segments of \(\Delta\eta\times\Delta\phi\) = 0.15 \(\times\) 0.15. Lead, steel or a combination of both are considered as absorber materials. The current design is based on commercially available liquid scintillators.

#### 2.2.3 Basic Design Parameters

	* 2.5 m
* 200 tonnes per side
* 5 \(m^{3}\) per side

* about 1.5 %
* 7\(\times\) 7 \(m^{2}\)
* 3000 per side
- 1000 per side
* 0.60/\(\sqrt{E}\) + 0.04

#### 2.2.4 R \(\&\) D Results

An array of four full-scale 2.5 m long modules (see e.g. [11] was tested in the SPS beam in the energy range 20-120 GeV [12]. To reduce the channeling effect, a 3\(X_{0}\) passive preradiator was placed 2 m upstream. Figure 4 shows the pulse height distribution for 120 GeV electrons at 1 degree incidence angle. The response is almost Gaussian. The resolution determined from the fit is 14.7 %. It improves slightly when the angle increases. The detector was not sufficiently large to contain hadronic showers. Therefore the hadronic resolution could not be studied in detail. The response to 120 GeV pions with the preradiator in place is given in Figure 5. The low energy tail is well understood as due to leakage. Based on the measurements, a hadronic resolution of \((10\pm 2)\)% is expected in the case of full shower containment.

#### 2.2.5 Radiation Hardness Issues

The high radiation doses expected at the LHC are concentrated in a few percent of the total volume of the forward calorimeter. In this region quartz tubes would be used. For the liquid scintillator, calculations show that at a flow speed of 20 cm/hour it would be exposed in a single pass to 0.1 Mrad before being recycled. Another source of concern is PM damage in high neutron fluxes. It is known that PMs survive neutron fluences in excess of \(10^{15}n/cm^{2}\). Some loss of gain and increase in dark current are expected as a consequence of damage. Should it turn out that the performance is inadequate, the PMs could be located at a safe distance from the beam pipe.

#### 2.2.6 Safety Aspects

To avoid risk of a liquid leak it is considered advisable to operate the system at a pressure less than atmospheric.

### Gas Ionization Calorimeter

IHEP propose to use a high pressure gas (HPG) ionization calorimeter. It offers the following advantages:

* good radiation resist ance;
* fast response time;
* rather easy maintainance;
* reasonable energy and space resolution;
* simple (electronic) calibration;
* absence of dead zones;
* design flexibility based on a modular structure;* safety and reliability;
* modest cost.

Three types of HPG FCAL design have been studied, namely: parallel plates, coaxial tubes and a hybrid of the two. All of them satisfy the ATLAS Forward Calorimetry requirements and prototypes show good performance in beam tests.

Consideration of the advantages and disadvantages of the three designs led to a proposal for a combined version following a recommendation of the panel.

The following paragraphs describe the three original options as well as the combined one which became the version proposed for ATLAS.

#### 2.3.1 Parallel Plate Option

The calorimeter consists of 16 semicircular modules ( Figure 6) with 42 cm and 3.9 m inner and outer diameters respectively, and 29 cm thick. Each module has 10 absorbers made of steel. Signal electrodes made of 1 mm thick steel pads are placed between the absorbers forming two equal ionization gaps. The pad size, gap width and absorber thickness depend on the radial position of the pad and are shown in Table 1.

Nine pads with the same values of \(R,\phi\) are connected to eachother forming 500 cells in the module. The module weight is 20 tonnes. The total calorimeter thickness is 10.8\(\lambda\) for R \(<\) 96 cm and 8.2 \(\lambda\) for R \(>\) 96 cm.

The calorimeter is designed to operate at up to 15 atm. It is filled with a 90% \(Ar+10\%CF_{4}\) gas mixture, which is non-flammable, non-explosive, and non-toxic.

The HV applied to the signal pads is equal to 450 V/cm.atm which corresponds to the maximum drift velocity of 0.12 mm/ns.

Signals from each cell are transported to the amplifiers using 4m 50 \(\Omega\) cables. The preamplifier characteristics are as follows:

* noise 0.5 nV/Hz
* rise time 3 n s
* signal width at 10% level 24 n s

Preamplified signals are summed forming the electromagnetic (the first two sections) and hadronic (the last six sections) parts of the calorimeter. Thus, the total number of amplifiers and ADCs is 2,000 per side. The estimated equivalent noise energy (ENE) is about 2 GeV for a tower of 7.5 \(\times\) 7.5 \(cm^{2}\) and 1 GeV for 10.6 \(\times\) 10.6 \(cm^{2}\). The ENE for the whole calorimeter is 46 GeV.

A detailed study of the calorimeter characteristics as a function of hadron and electron energies, absorber material and thickness, gas pressure, HV, ADC gate width and delay has

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|} \hline R, cm & Pad size, cm & Gap width, mm & Absorber thickness, mm \\ \hline
21-96 & 7.5 \(\times\) 7.5 & 2 \(\times\) 3 & 22 \\
96-195 & 10.6 \(\times\) 10.6 & 2 \(\times\) 6 & 16 \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 1: Some Dimensions of the Parallel Plate Optionbeen made in beams of 70 GeV at the IHEP Synchrotron [13]. The results give the following energy resolutions

* \(\frac{\sigma(E)}{E}=\frac{0.75}{\sqrt{E}}\oplus 0.025\) for hadrons
* \(\frac{\sigma(E)}{E}=\frac{0.30}{\sqrt{E}}\) for electrons

The constant term for electrons is less than 1%. The linearity is better than 1% in the energy range up to 60 GeV. The pulse height distributions have no tail (Figure 7).

Simulations have been performed to estimate the jet energy resolution, \(E_{T}\)-resolution and other characteristics important for the forward region. The results show that the proposed option meets all the ATLAS requirements.

#### 2.3.2 Pressurized Gas Coaxial Tube Option

The calorimeter has an outer radius of 184 cm and a length of 230 cm with a 40 cm diameter central hole to allow for the copper shield. The \(\eta\) coverage of the calorimeter is \(|\eta|=3\div 5\). Both sides consist of a central part \(64\times 64\times\) 230 \(cm^{3}\) and basic modules \(8\times 8\times 230\)\(cm^{3}\) totalling 1840 on each side (Figure 8).

A module consists of a uniformly positioned set of \(8\times 8=64\) thin walled stainless steel tubes with their axes parallel to the beam direction. The inner diameter of the tubes is 6.8 mm, and their centres are 9.6 mm apart. The space between tubes is filled with lead or other absorbing material such as iron.

Central electrodes (anodes) are made of stainless steel rods with a diameter of 3.6 mm and are kept in place with spacers. The gap of 1.6 mm gives 26% gas filling to the total module volume. The design permits operation at 30-40 atm. using a \(90\%Ar+10\%\,CF_{4}\) gas mixture.

A module can have an internal longitudinal segmentation into Electromagnetic and Hadronic parts. Choosing 40 cm (EM) and 190 cm (Had) gives at least 30 \(X_{0}\) for the EM part and nearly 10 \(\lambda\) for the whole calorimeter.

Each part (EM and Had) of the module has \(4\times 4=16\) elementary cells with a size near 20 \(\times\) 20 \(mm^{2}\) which are connected to an amplifier via 5 m long cables. The amplifiers as well as summing circuits are situated on both sides of the calorimeter.

The device prototype (Figure 9) was tested in the IHEP U-70 electron beam and showed good performance:-

* equivalent noise energy about 1 GeV for an 8 \(\times\) 8 \(cm^{2}\) cell;
* 25 ns base-to-base signal duration;
* energy resolution for electrons in accordance with expectations;
* a 4-6 \(X_{0}\) converter placed before the calorimeter improves its uniformity of response to electrons.

More detailed test results are described in [14].

An extensive series of simulation studies gave its energy resolutions as follows:

* \(\frac{\sigma(E)}{E}=\frac{0.4}{\sqrt{E}}\oplus 0.1\) for \(e,\gamma\)
* \(\frac{\sigma(E)}{E}=\frac{0.7}{\sqrt{E}}\oplus 0.1\) for single hadron
* \(\frac{\sigma(E)}{E}=\frac{0.8}{\sqrt{E}}\oplus 0.1\) for jets

#### 2.3.3 Hybrid High Pressure Gas Calorimeter

The idea behind the hybrid version of the gas ionization calorimeter is to initiate showers in a first section made of plates perpendicular to the beam direction, thus profiting from their geometrical uniformity of response, and to follow this with a tube section which has better electrical characteristics. It has a modular structure and consists of 912 identical 2 m long modules of hexagonal shape using a gas mixture under a pressure of 25-30 atm. The outer shell of each module is a hexagonal industrial stainless steel tube with an inner circle diameter of 92 mm.

The inner design of each module is shown in Figure 10. In the longitudinal direction the module has two sections. The first one consists of parallel plate ionization chambers with the anode plane between two absorber plates. The absorbers are 20 mm iron plates (20 pieces) covered by copper. The anode plane is made from copper plates 0.4 mm thick. The gas gaps are 2 mm. This section has 2.5 \(\lambda\).

The second section is made using cylindrical ionization chambers. The outer electrode of each chamber is a stainless steel or copper tube with inner diameter 4 mm. The anode is copper-beryllium wire, 0.4 mm in diameter. The layout aims for reasonable uniformity, and is also shown in Figure 10 with relevant dimensions. Each module has 61 ionization tubes, 1.4 m long, running parallel to the module axis. The absorber in this part is a lead.

Ceramic spacers are used throughout for electrical isolation which ensures radiation resistance.

At the ends of the module and between the two sections there are 45-50 mm gaps to locate the printed circuit boards, HV capacitors and resistors, summing circuits and output signal connectors. The end walls of the module are welded to the hexagonal tube.

To obtain a fast response, a gas mixture of \(95\%Ar+5\%CF_{4}\) or \(90\%Ar+10\%CF_{4}\) is used. The charge collection time for the second gas mixture is 17-19 ns.

To sum the signals from the gas gaps in the first section, a waveguide line with an impedance of 20 \(\Omega\) is formed from the capacitances of the parallel plates and inductances placed between the plates. The principle is shown in Figure 11. The signals from the waveguide lines go to a transformer, which sums signals from two parts of the first section and matches the waveguide lines to the output strip line. The time delay of the signal in the waveguide line is 8 ns. The transformer is a ferrite ring with outer diameter of a few mm. The bandwidth of the waveguide line is 180 MHz.

For the second section three schemes have been considered to sum the signals from the tubes.

Scheme 1 - the outputs of the chambers are summed through an impedance matching transformer;

Scheme 2 - an individual tube output connects with a matching preamplifier; the output signals from the preamps are then summed together on the input resistor of the second stage amplifier;

Scheme 3 - the tube outputs come to a common point and a transformer matches the capacitances of the detector and the amplifier;

Using Monte Carlo simulations [15] it has been found that the jet energy resolution for the hybrid version of the FCAL can be expressed as follows: \((\Delta E/E)_{jrt}=(96\pm 15)\%/\sqrt{E}\oplus(3\pm 2)\%\).

Several prototypes of this design were tested in particle beams [16].

### Combined Version of the Gas Calorimeter

All of the options described above have certain disadvantages that are avoided as far as possible in the combined version which profits from the good features of the various techniques.

* the parallel plate option is characterised by a rather high noise level (around 2 GeV) for the central part and a large module size that makes assembly, transportation and maintenance difficult;
* the coaxial tube option suffers from geometrical inhomogeneity in response which degrades the electromagnetic energy resolution;
* the hybrid design, while avoiding the intrinsic non-uniformity of the tube option, nevertheless has a significant geometrical inhomogeneity because of common gaseous vessels, and a similar noise level to the parallel plate one (because of impedance matching resistors).

The new Combined Version is free of most of these disadvantages and consists of an electromagnetic section having a parallel plate modular structure and a hadronic one based on coaxial tubes. A general view of the device is show on Figure 12

All the cabling as well as the gas distribution system go to the front face of the calorimeter for the electromagnetic part and to the back face for the hadronic part. The front-end electronics are situated at the sides of the detector.

Both sections are mounted on a platform that permits the whole device to be split into two halves and moved downward to give access to other detectors.

The main features of the proposed detector are described below.

#### 2.4.1 Electromagnetic Section

The calorimeter consists of 84 modules with transverse dimensions of 32\(\times\)32 \(cm^{2}\) and 2 special modules of 32\(\times\)64 \(cm^{2}\) in the centre with a 40 cm diameter hole (Figure 13). The outer size of the calorimeter is 3.2 m, its total thickness being 50 cm. Each module is divided into 16 cells (Figure 13) and has 13 absorbers made of 30 mm steel plates (Figure 14). The steel plates are welded to each other at the edge with a spacing of 7 mm. A total of 16 signal electrodes made of 1 mm steel pads are placed between the absorbers forming two 3 mm drift gaps (Figure 15). The pads are fixed with radiation hard ceramic spacers. Their size is 76\(\times\)76 \(mm^{2}\). 12 pads along the module are connected to each other forming the 16 cells.

The total number of cells per calorimeter is 1392. The cell thickness is 2.4\(\lambda\) or 23\(X_{0}\). This thickness is enough to absorb the electromagnetic showers and to minimize the dependence of the hadronic response on the incidence angle with respect to the tube axis in the hadronic part of the detector. All the connectors are mounted on the front plate.

The module is designed to operate at up to 15 atm. It is filled with a 90%\(Ar+10\%CF_{4}\) gas mixture. The HV applied to the pads is equal to 135 V/atm, which corresponds to the maximum electron drift velocity. The total drift time is 25 ns.

Signals from each cell are transported to the amplifiers using 50 \(\Omega\) cables. The dynamic range of the amplifier is 10\({}^{4}\). The equivalent noise energy (ENE) per cell is about 0.5 GeV which corresponds to an ENE of 19 GeV for the whole electromagnetic calorimeter.

A study of the calorimeter characteristics has been performed in the electron beam of the 70 GeV IHEP accelerator [13]. For the central part of the module the energy resolution for EMshowers is \(\frac{\sigma(E)}{E}=\frac{0.32}{\sqrt{E}}\) with a constant term of less than 1%. From an EM shower simulation based on GEANT, the constant term averaged over the detector is 6% which is acceptable for ATLAS.

#### 2.4.2 Hadronic Section

The coaxial tube section has many features in common with those described in 2.3.2. These include the following:

* module (or cell) size 8\(\times\) 8 \(cm^{2}\);
* total length 200 cm, active medium length 190 cm;
* stainless steel tubes of 7-10 mm inner diameter combined in a 8\(\times\) 8 = 6t or 6\(\times\) 6 = 36 matrix;
* central electrodes made of stainless steel rods giving a gap of 1.6-1.8 mm;
* lead, iron or some other material as an absorber;
* \(90\%Ar+10\%CF_{4}\) gas mixture under a pressure of 30-40 atm as active medium; the mixture is nonflammable, nonexplosive, nontoxic (\(CF_{4}\) is permitted for use at CERN).

Rods are preferred to wires because of their better ageing performance. As shown in [17] such a construction can operate at LHC luminosity.

Nevertheless, studies are continuing on a tube-wire system such as that described in 2.3.3 because of its better impedance characteristics.

Signals from a few tubes (from 4 to 16 depending on the chosen impedance) are combined at a point and go via a matching transformer to a 50 \(\Omega\) 5 m long cable. A number of cables are combined at the amplifier inputs such that one or two amplifiers serve one module. This gives a noise level (ENC FWHM) of 20,000 electrons at 30 ns signal duration and corresponds to 1 GeV noise at 30 atm for an iron calorimeter.

#### 2.4.3 Prototype designs

Prototypes similar to the proposed design parts have been constructed and tested at IHEP during the last few years and show features that are adequate to meet the ATLAS FCAL demands. Finite element calculations and pressure tests with a model have been used to confirm the mechanical rigidity of the proposed design.

A full scale prototype would be constructed at IHEP should the IHEP administration and the ATLAS collaboration decide to support the project.

#### 2.4.4 Predicted characteristics

A full GEANT simulation [18] has been performed for the design as well as beam tests mentioned above. Based on the latter, the following characteristics are expected at high energy [13]:

* \(\frac{\sigma(E)}{E}=\frac{0.32}{\sqrt{E}}\oplus 0.06\) for \(e,\gamma\)
* \(\frac{\sigma(E)}{E}=\frac{0.70}{\sqrt{E}}\oplus 0.09\) for single hadron* \(\frac{\sigma(E)}{E}=\frac{0.85}{\sqrt{E}}\oplus 0.06\) for jets

The physics performance is discussed further in section 6.3.

#### 2.4.5 Alternative location

Following the introduction of the integrated solution in 1994, the IHEP group studied an alternative position for the gas calorimeter 2.5 m closer to the main detector. This has the advantage of separating the calorimeter from the copper shield protecting the quadrupoles which, apart from the practical advantages, avoids the problem of energy from particles interacting in the copper feeding into the calorimeter. These points make the location preferable to the original baseline choice which had the copper block inside the calorimeter.

## 3 The Integrated Solution

### Motivation

The case for the integrated solution solution is presented in [19], with supporting documentation in [20] and [21]. It has been traditional to locate the forward calorimeter as far as feasible from the interaction point in order to lower the energy density as much as possible. There are, however, several advantages to be obtained from including the FCAL in the endcap region:-

* avoidance of the 'crack' between the endcap and forward calorimeters, in particular the effect of the cryostat walls on jet energy measurements
* reduction of other material, pumps, flanges etc., in front of the FCAL
* containment of energy within the main detector volume, with a consequent reduction of backgrounds in the muon chambers
* increase of the space available for muon chamber coverage as a result of removing the need for a downstream shielding cone around \(|\eta|=3\) (see Figure 2).

The integrated forward calorimeter (IFC) is housed in the same cryostat as the endcap calorimeters. With careful design, the calorimeter coverage is able to extend to \(|\eta|=4.9\) which satisfies the physics requirement.

### Design

The basic design features of the IFC are given in [19]. While liquid argon is radiation hard, its ability to handle the high energy densities experienced in the forward direction can be limited by positive ion buildup [22]. In order to avoid this problem small gaps must be employed so that the positive ions drift out of the gap in an acceptable time. This demands a gap tolerance of unprecedented precision. Since conventional parallel plates are expensive to control to the necessary levels a new electrode structure is employed.

The basic electrode is a rod within a tube. The rod is held in place with a spiralled quartz fibre. For the first EM module the rod is at a high voltage of 250 V and the tube is at ground. The gap between the O D of the rod (4.5 mm) and the ID of the tube (5.0 mm) is filled with liquid argon. The gap is 0.25 mm across, much smaller than the more usual 2 mm of most other liquid argon parallel plate sampling calorimeters. These electrodes are parallel to the beam line so they are at a small angle to incident particles. Hence, channeling is not a problem. The electrodes are embedded in an absorber matrix in an hexagonal array with nearest neighbour spacing of 7.5 mm. The complete EM module, including rods, tubes, and matrix, is made entirely of brass. See references [10] and [21]. This is 45 cm deep or about 2.5 \(\lambda\). Figure 16 shows a section of the front face of this module.

The rods and matrix for the next two modules are made of a Tungsten alloy in order to limit the transverse size of hadronic showers. The nearest neighbour electrode spacing is larger, proportional to the distance from the interaction point so that there is pseudoprojectivity. Also the electrode gaps are larger since the energy density is smaller. The three modules appear in Figure 17 embedded in the endcap calorimeter. Shown is one of a number of concepts for the cryostat and support in which the IFC is contained in a rigid cone structure that allows the cryostat wall nearest the beam pipe to be kept thin. An alternative structure in which the strength is provided by fins or vanes is shown in Figure 18. The total active depth of the forward calorimeter is 10 \(\lambda\). The absorber at the back end is additional shielding for the first forward muon super layer. The polyethylene helps to reduce albedo in the inner detector, due to the forward calorimeter, to a level small compared to other sources. The cables which carry the signals to remote preamps are not shown. Table 2 gives summary information for the integrated forward calorimeter.

### Expected Performance

The energy resolution for electrons and photons, as measured in a test beam is

* \(\frac{\sigma(E)}{E}=\frac{0.35}{\sqrt{E}}\oplus 0.04\)

The position resolution for electrons and photons, as measured in the test beam is

* \(\Delta x=5.0mm/\sqrt{E}\oplus 0.9mm\)
* \(\Delta y=3.5mm/\sqrt{E}\oplus 0.6mm\)

The energy resolution for hadrons is estimated by Monte Carlo to be

* \(\frac{\sigma(E)}{E}=\frac{0.80}{\sqrt{E}}\oplus 0.07\)

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|c|} \hline  & EM & Had-A & Had-B \\ \hline Inner radius (mm) & 72 & 79 & 86 \\ Outer radius (mm) & 444 & 481 & 520 \\ Length (mm) & 450 & 450 & 450 \\ Z-midpoint (mm) & 4970 & 5420 & 5895 \\ Mass (tonne) & 2.4 & 5.1 & 5.9 \\ Tubes & 121 20 & 121 20 & 12120 \\ Channels & 3030 & 2020 & 1515 \\ \hline Total mass (tonne) & 13.4 & & \\ \hline Total channels & 6565 & & \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 2: Some Parameters of the Integrated Forward Calorimeter (one side)The energy resolution for jets is estimated by Monte Carlo to be

* \(\frac{\sigma(E)}{E}=\frac{0.70}{\sqrt{E}}\oplus 0.05\)

The electronics noise in the EM section goes as

* \(\Delta E=0.2GeV/cm\times\sqrt{A}\)

where \(A\) is the the area in \(cm^{2}\) of the front face of the calorimeter involved in the sum. For instance, if one is summing channels to get the optimum electron or photon energy resolution then the sum is over an area of about \(20~{}cm^{2}\). The electronics noise for this area is \(\Delta E=0.9~{}\mathrm{GeV}\).

### R \(\&\) D

A prototype EM module was tested in an electron beam at the Brookhaven AGS in the summer of 1993 and in the H8 beam in the CERN North Area in October of 1993. Energies from \(2~{}\mathrm{GeV}\) to \(200~{}\mathrm{GeV}\) were measured. The results are reported in reference [10]. In addition to measuring the energy and position resolution (reported above) as a function of electron energy and upstream material (to simulate cryostat walls, etc.) the module was also rotated to look for channeling effects. Small channeling effects were seen when the particles impinged at angles smaller than the actual module will see, i.e. below 1 degree.

## 4 Safety Considerations

### General Remarks

Whichever option is selected, part of the FCAL will have to operate in a very high radiation environment [9] p.82. Particular attention must therefore be given at the design stage to reliability, handling, assembly, maintenance and access. Personal exposure is limited to 15 mSv/year and the design limit should be \(5\) mSv/year. This means that the occupancy time per person is limited to \(50\) hours per year at \(0.1\) mSv/h and \(5\) hours per year at \(1.0\) mSv/h (\(100\) mrem/h).

As regards mechanical design, international or national standards such as ISO, DIN, AFNOR should be followed. As a rule, in mechanical design simplicity is synonymous with safety, whereas complexity can be a source of high risk and danger.

In the absence of full engineering designs, the observations given below can only be of a general nature. Safety requirements for LHC experiments have been summarised by H.Schonbacher [23].

### The 15m Liquid Options

#### 4.2.1 Liquid Argon

The quantity of liquid is small (\(10~{}m^{3}\)) compared of what is already in the barrel and endcap region (\(100~{}m^{3}\)). However to combine the infra-structure will be difficult and close contact and collaboration would have to be established with the ATLAS LAr cryogenics group. The presence of the collimator at the centre of the cryostat may considerably complicate the design, handling,access to the collimator, etc. The induced radioactivity of the argon should not be a problem (half life 110 min) unless there is an emergency leak. Safety requirements in the experimental hall (argon and oxygen detectors) could be determined together with the installations for the main detectors.

#### 4.2.2 Liquid scintillator

The liquid presently under consideration (BICRON BC-599-13) is flamm able (flashpoint 149 \({}^{o}C\)). The chemical and toxicological properties would have to be thoroughly investigated as well as its disposal as special chemical waste.

The mechanical design is similar to that of the gas options but the risks are lower as it operates at atmospheric pressure. The large number of modules (3000) with two connections each means that there are 6000 to be tested for leak tightness.

### The Gas Options

All the gas options use very high pressures (15 to 30 atm.). For safety reasons it is always better if high pressures are contained in small volumes. Again a large number of tubes, weldings and feedthroughs need to be designed and tested.

The rules to be used for the design of pressure vessels and pressurized pipelines should follow as far as possible the French construction code for pressure vessels CODAP (Syndicat national de la Chaudronnerie, de la Tolerie et de la Tuyauterie industrielle, F-75382 Paris CEDEX08, available in English), which could when necessary be complemented by the ASME code (American Society of Mechanical Engineers).

In view of the CERN policy to avoid flamm able gas in LHC underground areas it is appreciated that only non-flammable gas mixtures have been proposed (Ar + CF4).

### The Integrated Solution

As the IFC is inside the same cryostat as the endcap calorimeter, there are no extra safety issues provided the cryostat is properly designed. Activation is not a serious problem. This point is discussed further in section 6.

### Conclusions

All the proposed options have their particular safety hazard. These are for the liquid options leakage of cryogenic or flamm able and toxic liquids and for the gas options the risk related to high pressures. From a safety point of view, there is some preference for the gas option, in the case of the 15m solution, for reasons of simplicity.

## 5 Cost and Manpower

The panel reviewed the cost estimates for the mechanics of the 5 original 15m proposals. This has been done in a comparative approach, with the aim of understanding better the relative differences, rather than defining the absolute scale. In this spirit the comparisons have been performed for a notional calorimeter of 8 \(m^{2}\) front face (about 1.6 \(m\) external radius). The costs have then been further divided into pure mechanics costs associated with the construction of the device and infrastructure costs. Because of the differences between the various approaches on the definition and use of the institute manpower, the labour cost is quoted always in CHF, with the arbitrary assumption of 1 man hour = 40 CHF.

Table 3 gives a comparative summary for the 3 main options. The liquid scintillator has a somewhat lower mechanics cost. Further details can be found in Appendix 1.

The panel reviewed the cost estimates of the electronics for the same three options. The price estimates for the individual components are compatible with those of previous estimates for the main Liquid Argon calorimeter and the tile calorimeter. In addition, they are agreed between the groups proposing the various options. The electronics costs quoted in Table 3 do not include manpower. Further details may be found in Appendix 2. The inclusion of the electronics makes the costs of the three 15m options rather similar.

The cost estimate of the Integrated Forward Calorimeter, assuming that the boundary with the endcap calorimeter is at \(|\eta|=3.2\), is given in Table 4. In this case the costs include manpower.

\end{table}
Table 3: Comparative summary of the costs of the three main 15m optionsEvaluation of the various options

All of the proposed designs are capable of achieving the required performance as far as the basic calorimeter is concerned, as indicated by the test beam results and/or simulations mentioned earlier. The distinctions between them therefore depend on other features which include the effects on performance of the cryostat walls and the copper shield, as well as issues of convenience, reliability, access, and backgrounds in other parts of the detector.

### The 15m alternatives

The choice between the initial five options was made around the time that the integrated solution was introduced. As discussed in 2.4, the best features of the three gas proposals have been combined into a single design.

The panel considers the liquid scintillator option to be disfavoured because only one segmentation in depth is possible. The fact that the liquid has to be circulated is a complication avoided in other solutions which do not have moving parts. There is also some concern about the arrangement of the photomultipliers in the high radiation environment and the difficulty of servicing them.

The liquid argon solution has an intrinsically better performance than the other options, but the panel feels that this level of technology is not needed to achieve the required results at this location. The need to build the cryostat in two halves to allow opening (unless the vacuum were to be broken) would also give dead spaces with a consequent degradation of performance.

The panel concludes that the high pressure gas calorimeter (HPG) offers the simplest and most reliable way of achieving the required performance. Its features include uniform response, flexible modular design, and relatively easy access.

The suggested alternative location 2.5m nearer to the main detector, decoupling it from the copper shield, obviously offers both practical and performance advantages. Thus the panel feels able to recommend the HPG option as a viable solution for a calorimeter mounted outside the main detector. The performance in comparison to that of the integrated solution is discussed further below.

### The Integrated Solution

The arguments of possibly superior physics performance, reduced muon chamber backgrounds and improved muon coverage offered by the integrated solution were considered to be strong. The panel therefore requested a number of investigations summarised as follow s:-

* demonstration of superior physics performance for jet reconstruction
* effect on the endcap calorimeter (pileup)
* practical design to ensure \(|\eta|\) fiducial coverage to 4.5
* understanding of the origin of the radiation backgrounds, including albedo, in the inner detector
* access to the inner detector
* activation of materials including \({}^{41}\)Ar production * cost evaluation

All of these points were satisfactorily answered in a document submitted to the panel [24].

* The comparative physics performance is discussed in 6.3.
* There is some feedthrough of energy from the IFC to the endcap calorimeter but, surprisingly, the net effect is barely distinguishable from the case for the HPG calorimeter located downstream. In fact, the IFC also shields some particles that would otherwise have entered the inner walls of the endcap calorimeter.
* The practical design has been discussed in 3.2. The panel is confident that adequate solutions exist for the construction.
* Briefly, the origin of the radiation backgrounds is localised at the inner edge (\(|\eta|=5\)) of the IFC, in contrast to being distributed over a wide region for the HPG case. Obviously, the IFC contains energy that would otherwise appear downstream. Furthermore, after adding 20 cm of moderator in front of the IFC, the radiation in the inner detector (albedo) is no higher than in the HPG case, while it a factor of ten lower in the muon chambers. These results have been obtained in a study by Shupe and Rutherford [20], and independently by Fisyak [25], and have been checked by CERN experts (G. Stevenson and H. Schonbacher) and A. Ferrari. As examples, Figure 19 shows the neutron fluxes in the inner cavity, for radii between 15 and 30 cm, as a function of z for the "baseline" (i.e. HPG) and integrated solutions, and Figure 20 compares the photon fluxes in the first forward muon superlayer as a function of radius.
* Various scenarios for access to the inner detector, which involve moving the endcap along the beam pipe, have been worked out, and are certainly easier than in the HPG case.
* Activation levels have been calculated by L.Waters et al. at Los Alamos [26] and checked by approximate methods [27], [28]. In summary, the dose level due to the IFC, after 30 days of running at full luminosity and one day of cool-down, for access to the calorimeter electronics or the end of the inner detector is less than 1 mrem/hr, significantly less than from other sources, and acceptable (see 4.1). Because of the lower volume of liquid argon in the IFC, the amount of \({}^{41}\)Ar produced is only equal to that produced in the endcap.

### Comparison of Physics Performance

An extensive study of jet reconstruction for the HPG option has been carried out [29] for the case where the calorimeter is moved to be in front of the copper shield, thus avoiding feedthrough of energy from particles interacting in the shield. The most important result of the study is to emphasise the dependence of the measured jet energies and transverse momenta on the material and geometry of the cryostat. Best results are obtained with an Aluminium cryostat having a cone-shaped inner wall. Outwardly increasing and outwardly decreasing (reverse) cones both give better performance than a cylindrical wall, and both are acceptable. Figure 21 shows for example the effect on 1 TeV jet \(E_{T}\) measurement of various cryostat configurations, including the contribution of the endcap calorimeter. The bottom figures are for the cone-shaped inner walls.

Mismeasurement of the jet \(E_{T}\) in the region of the cryostat wall (\(|\eta|=3.2\)) does not increase the level of background for \(E_{T}^{miss}\) physics, nor the level of an inclusive \(E_{T}^{miss}\) trigger. However, it is also shown that, as expected, pile-up from multiple minimum bias events will dominate the jet energy resolution at high luminosities. This is illustrated in Figure 22.

As already discussed in sections 2.2.4 and 3.3, the expected intrinsic resolution of the IFC for jets is slightly better than that of the HPG. However, both satisfy the ATLAS requirement of better than \(100\%/\sqrt{E}\oplus 10\%\) (see 1.2.4).

Possible points of concern for the IFC are the crack between it and the endcap calorimeter, and the need to strengthen the cryostat with some internal structure to allow the wall nearest the beam pipe to be kept as thin as possible. A preliminary Monte Carlo study for the structure shown in Figure 18 has been carried out by the ITEP group [30]. Figure 23 shows the effect of the supporting fins or vanes on the response to jets of 1 TeV. Figure 24 shows the measured jet \(E_{T}\) compared to that generated, as a function of \(|\eta|\) with the crack at \(|\eta|=3.2\). The results show an acceptable performance, even without recalibration, that is at least as good as that of the HPG, and certainly acceptable.

In conclusion, both the HPG and the IFC have an acceptable performance as far as the calorimetry is concerned, while the IFC offers the further advantages of reduced background and improved coverage for the muon chambers.

Conclusions and Recommendations

In summary, the conclusions of the panel are that the combined version of the high pressure gas (HPG) calorimeter would provide an acceptable solution if the forward calorimeter were located outside the main detector ( see 6.1), particularly when separated from the copper shield for the quadrupole. However, the integrated forward calorimeter (IFC) in the same cryostat as the endcap calorimeter is preferred because of the simplification of the forward region that it permits. This allows improved muon coverage as well as reducing the backgrounds in the muon chambers by an order of magnitude, while not increasing the radiation in the inner detector ( see 6.2). Although the intrinsic physics performance is also somewhat better, this is not a strong argument as pile-up will dominate the jet energy resolution at high luminosity (see 6.3).

The panel therefore recommends the integrated forward calorimeter as the choice for the Technical Proposal. Because of its intimate relation to the endcap calorimeter, it is further recommended that the work should be included in the overall liquid argon calorimetry organisation.
