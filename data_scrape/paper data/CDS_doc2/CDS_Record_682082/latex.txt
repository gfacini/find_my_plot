Introduction

The required high momentum resolution of the ATLAS muon system makes the _local alignment_, i. e. the relative alignment of chambers intersected by one muon track (muon chamber towers) a very difficult problem. Requirements for the _global alignment_, i. e. relative alignment of different towers of the muon system and alignment of the whole muon system w.r.t. the interaction point and other ATLAS subdetectors (central tracker, calorimeter), are much less severe. The subject of this note is a new method for the local alignment of the ATLAS muon system. We refer to the alignment concept described in the ATLAS Technical Proposal [1] as the "TP scheme".

### General Approaches to the Local Alignment

There are different ways to achieve high local alignment accuracy.

The first one is very accurate _positioning_ of chambers w.r.t. each other. This approach was used by the \(L_{3}\)-collaboration for their muon system alignment [2]. The systematic sagitta error due to chamber misalignment was unprecedentedly low, 30 \(\mu m\)[3]. However, sizes of future collider detectors are on the order of a magnitude larger so that application of this method for the local alignment of their muon systems is excluded. Moreover, the above small misalignment error could only be reached with the help of additional optical monitoring of the relative chamber positions [3].

This was the reason why the collaborations SDC at SSC [4] and CMS at LHC [5] chose the another approach: very accurate _measurement_ of relative chamber positions.

The third method is based on readings of projectively oriented optical straightness monitors, which are used for correction of the systematic sagitta error caused by deviations of projective tower chambers from their ideal positions. In this case, not the relative displacements and rotations of chambers w.r.t. each other are measured, but directly the magnitude of _the false sagitta_[6]. This approach was chosen by the collaborations GEM at SSC [7] and ATLAS at LHC [1].

### The Pure Projective Scheme

The pure projective realization of the false sagitta method has considerable advantages, as there are simplicity and, hence, reliability, and the capability to control chamber deformations. At the same time it has the following difficulties:

* With projective rays at each chamber corner, the number of projective light paths is large. This can cause unacceptable acceptance losses and/or can make chamber layout and construction more difficult.
* Projectivity of chamber towers leads to a multiplication of chamber sizes.
* Chamber placement tolerances become rather severe.
* The performance of the method deteriorates, if the origin of the high momentum muon track is far from the center of the interaction region. For the LHC nominal bunch length of 5 cm these deterioration appears acceptable, but if the bunch length is considerably larger (e.g. the collider TEVATRON at FNAL has bunch length of 50 cm), it would be a serious problem for the pure projective alignment system.
* Finally, this approach can in general not be realized for the whole muon detector, since room for projective light paths is not everywhere available, as in the case of the ATLAS muon end-cap system.

### Beyond the Pure Projective Scheme

From the above, it is desirable to go beyond the pure projective scheme, preserving as far as possible its advantages. The ATLAS hybrid scheme (TP scheme) [1],[8],[9], which uses projective+axial+proximity monitors for the barrel region and pseudo-projective+radial+proximity monitors for the end-caps, is an important step in this direction.

However, this scheme has certain disadvantages:

* The use of proximity sensors not only increases the total number of monitors, but also leads to possible error accumulation.
* This scheme still requires rather many light paths. This is a particular difficulty for the end-cap sectors with six or even eight light paths per sector, including two paths through the end-cap magnet cryostat.

We propose a new scheme, in which polar monitors (located in planes of constant \(\phi\)) are placed on special "alignment bars", which are oriented axially in the barrel and radially in the end-caps. Alignment plates were first proposed for the GEM muon system [10]. These alignment bars define the local reference frames for the barrel and end-cap sectors. Positions of the chambers with respect to these frames are measured with in-plane optical multi-point monitors, which are oriented along the direction of the B field (i.e. azimuthally in planes of constant z).

_For the barrel region,_ where polar monitors are (pseudo-)projective, this scheme combines the advantages of the second (full reconstruction of relative chamber positions) and the third (measurement of sagita systematic error) approaches to muon system alignment (section 1.2). _For the end-caps_, it minimizes the number of light paths through a difficult region. _For both regions_, the scheme minimizes the number of monitors (less projective paths, no proximity sensors), and provides a reliable alignment procedure.

In this note, the results of the analytical and the Monte-Carlo analysis of the proposed scheme are presented. The requirements for the alignment system parameters which determine the error of the sagita correction are estimated.

## 2 Principles of the Alignment Scheme

The basic elements of the proposed alignment scheme are the following:

* Special bars, made of mechanically and thermally stable material (e.g. carbon fibre composites) form the skeleton of the alignment system on which the optical alignment devices are mounted.

* Multi-point straightness monitors, using collimating laser beams and transparent optical position sensors [11], are oriented in polar and azimuthal directions, i.e. in planes of constant \(\phi\) and z.

The whole alignment system is constructed from two simple subsystems (see Figs. 1 and 2). One system consists of three alignment bars, one for each chamber layer, with polar monitors and measures relative positions of the bars. The second system, using azimuthal monitors, controls the chamber positions w.r.t. the alignment bars.

These constituent parts of the alignment system are discussed in detail in the following.

### System of Alignment Bars and Polar Monitors

In Fig.1 the following principal set-up is shown: three alignment bars, placed along the inner, middle and outer chamber stations, i.e. axially in the barrel and radially in the end-caps, are supplied with two six-point polar monitors with sensors grouped in pairs on the bars.

Precision mounting of pairs of sensors relative to the internal coordinate frame of each bar can proceed by the use of special precisely machined mounting plates with 3 precision pin holes and a special mounting procedure, as, for example, proposed in [12].

The relative position of each bar with respect to one reference bar is characterized by six parameters: three displacements and three rotations; the number of local degrees of freedom of the system is twelve. Two six-point monitors have 12 two-dimensional sensors which provide 24 measurements.

Analytical consideration (see Appendix A) shows, that if the directions of two monitors are not parallel, the given information is sufficient for the full reconstruction of the relative positions of the bars.

It is necessary to note here, that it was the use of multi-point monitors which makes possible this full reconstruction, the measurements with 3-point monitors (e.g. RASNIK) provide only the information about some linear combination of relative position parameters.

The accuracy of the reconstruction depends on

* the polar sensor proper resolutions \(\sigma_{x}^{pol},\sigma_{z}^{pol}\) (rms),
* the accuracy of polar sensor positioning on the bars, given by tolerances \(\Delta_{x}^{pol}\), \(\Delta_{y}^{pol}\), \(\Delta_{z}^{pol}\) (rms),
* the distance \(L_{sen}\) between the sensors on the alignment bars.

### System of Alignment bars and Azimuthal Monitors

Bearing in mind the final goal to reconstruct relative positions of the chambers, the next step is the measurement of chamber positions w.r.t. the alignment bars. For this task we propose to use for each chamber two in-plane monitor arrays, directed azimuthally, i.e. along the direction of the B-field and of the chamber wires (see Fig. 2). Two laser beams connect the chambers to the two alignment bars, one of each end of the chamber tubes, where the laser sources are mounted. Two-dimensional sensors, mounted at chamber fiducial points normally to the collimated laser beams measure the two relevant chamber movements: along the z- and y-axes. There is no need to measure irrelevant chamber displacements along the wire direction.

This point is the main difference of the proposed scheme with the TP hybrid scheme, where in-plane monitors are directed axially and, hence, do not measure the most important z-coordinate. This is the only reason for the appearance of proximity sensors in the hybrid scheme and, as a consequence, of possible error accumulation problem.

Two azimuthal monitors per chamber allow to reconstruct all parameters characterizing the chamber position w.r.t. both bars, except one: an irrelevant chamber shift along wire direction (see Appendix B). It is possible to combine two monitors on two adjacent chambers into one monitor with two laser beams and four sensors, two per chamber (see Fig. 2).

For the implementation of this alignment system, the technologies and procedures elaborated for the axial alignment scheme [12] can be used.

The accuracy of chamber position reconstruction depends on

* the azimuthal sensor proper resolutions \(\sigma_{y}^{az},\sigma_{z}^{az}\) (rms),
* the accuracy of azimuthal sensor positioning on the chambers, given by tolerances \(\Delta_{y}^{az},\Delta_{z}^{az}\),
* the azimuthal beam spread \(\sigma_{y}^{\alpha},\sigma_{z}^{\alpha}\) (rms).

## 3 Layout for the Barrel and the End-caps

In this section, a possible geometrical realization of the alignment scheme is presented for the barrel and the end-caps. It will be shown that the proposed scheme blends with the ATLAS muon system layout rather naturally and, even more, simplifies certain layout problems.

### Barrel Region

The arrangement of alignment bars and monitor arrays in the barrel sectors is illustrated in Figs. 3 and 4 (front view) and in Fig. 5 (side view). Alignment bars are situated on each side of the large muon chamber and oriented axially along the chamber end rails. Each barrel sector has four alignment bars in the outer and the middle layer and two bars in the inner one. Polar multi-point monitors (pseudo-projective for the barrel region), 1B - 4B (Fig. 5), are mounted on the alignment bars (see Sect. 2.1). Only 8 pseudo-projective beams are needed in each sector of a barrel hemisphere.

In the present barrel chamber layout [1], where the outer large chambers are mounted at larger radius than the outer small chambers (Fig. 3), polar monitors require holes in the small middle and small outer chambers. Holes in the small middle chambers can be avoided by using free space between the chambers at the coil stiffening ribs for the light paths.

The small middle chambers have to fit between the stiffening ribs of the coils. Maximizing coverage in this area leads to complications for the construction and installation of T-shaped chambers with insignificant gain in acceptance. Using rectangular chambers fitting between the ribs, instead, avoids these problems and leaves free room for passing light beams at the same time.

It is possible to avoid holes in the small outer chambers as well, by mounting these chambers at larger radius than the large outer chambers (see Fig. 4). In this case, all the chambers, small and large, can be made without any holes for alignment monitors avoiding complications in chamber layout and construction.

For both possible layouts (Figs. 3 and 4) the alignment system doesn't interfere with the large muon sectors, which provide the most accurate measurement of muon momentum for the larger part of the barrel solid angle.

The arrangement of azimuthal straightness monitors on muon chambers and alignment bars has been described in Sect. 2.2.

The proposed scheme does not contain the requirement of chamber projectivity and, hence, does not restrict their sizes.

What is more, this scheme does not have inherently the requirement of polar monitor projectivity. This flexibility in position and orientation of polar monitors allows to put light paths through existing holes and to solve the problem of the alignment of the muon system end-caps.

### End-cap Region

The alignment bars are oriented radially in the end-caps. Front views for the middle and outer end-cap layers are shown in Fig. 6 and 7 (the layout for the inner layers is similar). Same segmentation of end-cap layers as in Technical Proposal can be used.

Possible directions of polar monitors (four per sector) are shown in Fig. 5: monitor arrays 1E and 2E are outside the end-cap cryostat, arrays 3E are directed through the holes in the cryostat and monitors 4E are within the cryostat inner radius. Alignment bars are mounted behind the inner and the middle end-cap chambers and in front of the outer ones. Therefore, it is necessary to have holes for the light beams in the middle end-cap layers only.

The azimuthal monitors, controlling the position of the chambers w.r.t. the bars, have two or four (for radially outer part of outer end-cap layer), transparent sensors each (see Figs. 6,7).

The two azimuthal monitors on adjacent chambers can be combined to one with double the number of sensors.

An important feature of this lay-out in the end-caps is the following. Each alignment bar is common for two adjacent sectors, so that all end-cap sectors are globally aligned w.r.t. each other, forming a solid cylindrically symmetrical belt.

## 4 Results of Monte-Carlo Simulations

A MonteCarlo program, based on the analytical model described in the Appendix, was used for the study of the proposed scheme. This program simulates the geometry of the ATLAS muon system and accounts for the followings factors affecting the performance of the alignment scheme:

* displacements and rotations of chambers w.r.t. their ideal positions, \(D^{ch}_{x,y,z}\), \(R^{ch}_{x,y,z}\);
* displacements and rotations of alignment bars w.r.t. their ideal positions, \(D^{bar,z}_{x,y,z}\), \(R^{bar}_{x,y,z}\);
* chamber measurement precision in the non-bend coordinate, \(\sigma^{ch}_{nb}\);* longitudinal interaction point spread \(\sigma^{IP}_{z}\) which leads to non-projectivity of high-momentum particles;
* polar sensor resolutions, \(\sigma^{pol}_{x,z}\);
* accurateness of polar sensor positioning on the bars, \(\Delta^{pol}_{x,y,z}\);
* distance between sensors on the bar, \(L_{sen}\) (defines size of the bars);
* azimuthal sensor resolutions, \(\sigma^{az}_{y,z}\);
* accurateness of azimuthal sensor positioning on the chamber \(\Delta^{az}_{y,z}\);
* azimuthal spread of laser beam direction, \(\sigma^{\alpha}_{y,z}\).

The resulting performance parameter of the alignment procedure is \(RMS_{cs}\) - the root-mean-square of the corrected sagitta distribution.

The following values were assumed for the parameters characterizing the alignment system implementation in the barrel and end-cap regions:

\[\sigma^{pol}_{x}=\sigma^{pol}_{z}=\sigma^{az}_{y}=\sigma^{az}_{z}=5\ \mu m\,, \tag{1}\]

\[\Delta^{pol}_{x}=\Delta^{pol}_{y}=\Delta^{pol}_{z}=\Delta^{pol}_{z}=\Delta^{az}_ {y}=\Delta^{az}_{z}=\Delta^{az}_{z}=\pm 20\ \mu m\,, \tag{2}\]

\[\sigma^{\alpha}_{y}=\sigma^{\alpha}_{z}=10\ \mu rad, \tag{3}\]

\[L_{sen}=60\ cm, \tag{4}\]

\[\sigma^{ch}_{nb}=1\ cm. \tag{5}\]

The sensitivity of the \(RMS_{cs}\) value to variation of these parameters was also studied.

### MC Simulations of the Barrel Region

As mentioned in Sect. 3.1, the barrel sector pseudorapidity interval \(0\leq\eta\leq 1.1\) is divided into two towers \(0\leq\eta\leq 0.6\) and \(0.6\leq\eta\leq 1.1\), by using two alignment bars of equal lengths in each outer and middle layer (see Fig. 5).

An important feature of the track sagitta error is its greater sensitivity to relative chamber displacements for smaller track incidence angle. Therefore, we can expect larger values of \(RMS_{cs}\) for higher values of \(\eta\) in the barrel and for lower values of \(\eta\) in the end-caps. MC simulations confirm this behavior of \(RMS_{cs}\).

The results of MC calculations for the first barrel tower \(0<\eta<0.6\) are presented in Table 1. The relative position of the alignment bars is controlled by the polar monitors 1B and 2B (Fig. 5). The values of \(RMS_{cs}\) for three subintervals and averaged over the whole tower rapidity interval are shown.

The results for the second barrel tower \(0.6<\eta<1.1\) are shown in Table 2 for two sets of polar monitors: 2B+4B and 2B+3B+4B (see Fig. 5).

We would like to stress here, that these results do not depend on the magnitudes of chamber and alignment bars displacements and rotations over a wide range. In particular, no change occurs in \(RMS_{cs}\) up to as large values of \(D^{ch}_{x,y,z}\), \(R^{ch}_{x,y,z}\), \(D^{bar}_{x,y,z}\), \(R^{bar}_{x,y,z}\) as

\[D^{ch}_{x,y,z},D^{bar}_{x,y,z}\leq\pm 2\ cm\,, \tag{6}\]\[R^{ch}_{x,y,z},R^{bar}_{x,y,z}\leq\pm 3\ mrad. \tag{7}\]

Further increase of these values would exceed the foreseen measurement range of the optical alignment devices.

Similarly, the results are stable w.r.t. change of the interaction point spread \(\sigma^{IP}_{z}\) up to a value of 50 \(cm\).

The results presented in Tables 1 and 2 show that the alignment system with parameter values (1)-(4) and with the set of eight polar monitors 1B+2B+3B+4B for each sector of a barrel hemisphere (four on each side) provides sufficient sagitta correction accuracy for the whole barrel solid angle without the use of the false sagitta measurement method.

Projective orientation of polar monitors in the barrel region provides the unique opportunity to apply both method of sagitta reconstruction and makes the barrel alignment system "double protected".

MC simulations show, that when both methods are applied simultaneously the resulting value of \(RMS_{cs}\), is smaller, than the corresponding values for these two methods, when they are used individually.

Namely, for the same assumptions (1)-(7) and for the displacements of the barrel sector up to 2 cm, the value of \(RMS_{cs}\), averaged over the whole sector is

\[RMS_{cs}=21\ \mu m. \tag{8}\]

### MC Simulations of the End-cap Region

In the end-caps region, the incidence angle range is similar to the one in the lower rapidity barrel tower. Therefore one can expect similar accuracy of the sagitta correction. MC simulation results prove this expectation (see Table 3).

Again, these results are stable w.r.t. variation of the values of \(D^{ch}_{x,y,z}\), \(R^{ch}_{x,y,z}\), \(D^{bar}_{x,y,z}\), \(R^{bar}_{x,y,z}\) and \(\sigma^{IP}_{z}\) in the intervals, given in the previous section.

The main conclusion from the MC study of the end-cap region is that event two polar monitors 1E+3E or 1E+4E per end-cap sector are sufficient to achieve required sagitta correction

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|c|c|c|} \hline Method(s) & Monitors & 0\(<\eta<\)0.2 & 0.2\(<\eta<\)0.4 & 0.4\(<\eta<\)0.6 & 0\(<\eta<\)0.6 \\ \hline full rec. & 1B+2B & 25 \(\mu m\) & 29 \(\mu m\) & 31 \(\mu m\) & 28 \(\mu m\) \\ full rec. + sag. & 1B+2B & 19 \(\mu m\) & 19 \(\mu m\) & 21 \(\mu m\) & 19 \(\mu m\) \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}

\end{table}
Table 2: \(RMS_{cs}\) (see text) for the barrel rapidity interval 0.6 \(<\eta<\) 1.1accuracy of about 30 \(\mu m\)[1].

The dependencies of \(RMS_{cs}^{avr}\) on the values of alignment system parameters related to the bend direction, are shown in Figs. 9-13. \(RMS_{cs}^{avr}\) dependencies on the non-bend parameters are weaker.

As one can see, none of the values (1)-(4) saturates the total error budget of about 30 \(\mu m\), and there is still reserve for each parameter. The same conclusion is valid for the barrel region.

## 5 Alignment Requirements and Tolerances

The MC study of the proposed alignment scheme allows to estimate requirements for the parameters characterizing alignment system performance.

### Resolution of Monitors

The proper resolution of optical monitors (not including the accuracy of monitor placement), \(\sigma^{mon}\) has to satisfy the requirement

\[\sigma^{mon}\leq 10\ \mu m, \tag{9}\]

both for polar and for azimuthal monitors, and both for bend and non-bend coordinate measurements.

This requirement of monitor resolution is quite conservative for multi-point straightness monitors using collimated laser beams and transparent optical position sensors [11].

### Monitor Positioning Accuracy and Beam Direction Spread

Detailed MC simulations show, that the requirements for monitor placement accuracy are different for different monitor orientations in the ATLAS muon system, but it is reasonable to establish uniform conservative requirements for all monitors and for all coordinates.

The uniform requirement for the positioning accuracy of sensors \(\Delta^{sen}\) is the following:

\[\Delta^{sen}\leq\pm 20\ \mu m. \tag{10}\]

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|c|} \hline Monitors & \(RMS_{cs}^{min}\) & \(RMS_{cs}^{max}\) & \(RMS_{cs}^{avr}\) \\ \hline
1E+3E & 20 \(\mu m\) & 31 \(\mu m\) & 27 \(\mu m\) \\
1E+4E & 17 \(\mu m\) & 30 \(\mu m\) & 25 \(\mu m\) \\
1E+2E+3E & 20 \(\mu m\) & 30 \(\mu m\) & 26 \(\mu m\) \\
1E+2E+4E & 17 \(\mu m\) & 30 \(\mu m\) & 24 \(\mu m\) \\
1E+2E+3E+4E & 17 \(\mu m\) & 28 \(\mu m\) & 23 \(\mu m\) \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 3: \(RMS_{cs}\) for the end-capsThe important parameter characterizing azimuthal monitors is the spread of the collimated laser beam direction \(\sigma_{\alpha}\). It has to meet the condition:

\[\sigma^{\alpha}\leq 10\ \mu rad. \tag{11}\]

### Positioning of Chambers and Plates

The proposed scheme does not impose special restrictions on the positioning of muon chambers and alignment plates. The requirements for these parameters are determined by other factors: limited dynamic range of optical monitors, global alignment requirements, magnetic field measurement accuracy and so on.

## 6 Control of Chamber Deformations

Finally, we would like to discuss the ability of the azimuthal alignment monitors to control chamber deformations.

In the TP scheme [1], a special system of four in-plane monitors per chamber, oriented in azimuthal and diagonal directions, is foreseen for this purpose.

Analytical consideration (see Appendix C) shows, that control of chamber torsion deformations (the reason for diagonal in-plane monitors in the TP scheme) and chamber gravitational sag in the xy-plane (which is measured by azimuthal in-plane monitors in the TP scheme) can be achieved in the proposed approach by the same system of azimuthal monitors which also controls the position of chambers w.r.t. the alignment bars.

Namely, if the azimuthal monitors are supplied with three (instead of two) sensors mounted on the chamber spacers (see Fig. 14), it is possible to reconstruct chamber sag and torsions.

This approach to chamber deformation control has the following features:

* The system is easily adaptable to variations in chamber technology. For example, for short chamber with only two spacers, two azimuthal monitors with two sensors each still control chamber torsion deformations. If, on the contrary, long chambers should have more than three spacers, say four, a system of two azimuthal monitors with four sensors each, mounted on the four spacers, is able to control complex chamber torsions and sags;
* The system can also be modified for additional information in the orthogonal direction. If it would be necessary to control gravitational sag of wide chambers in the yz-plane, too, a set of three azimuthal monitors could determine complex chamber profiles w.r.t. the plane defined by the laser beams;
* It allows to avoid a dedicated subsystem for monitoring of chamber deformation, making the overall alignment system more simple (see Tables 4 and 5).

## 7 Remarks on the Technical Implementation

The alignment bars, made of carbon fiber material, for example, provide a thermally stable reference system. It is, however, difficult to make the long bars sufficiently rigid mechanically, as was assumed for the simulations in this note. Mechanical deformations of the alignment bars, depending on their location in the muon spectrometer and on the method for their support (e.g. on the rail system for the chambers of the large towers; see [1]), can either be measured and calibrated or continuously monitored with optical methods. Two straightness monitors along the length of each bar are sufficient to control gravitational sag and torsions of the bars.

Another constraint which is difficult to achieve mechanically, is the required precision of about 10 \(\mu\)rad (rms) in the direction of the azimuthal laser beams w.r.t. the alignment bars. The laser beam direction can be measured with a receiving sensor on the bar opposite to the one carrying the light source (see Fig. 8). In addition, one needs to know the relative position and orientation of the two bar systems on each side of a barrel or endcap sector. This can be achieved with two 4-point monitors connecting the two opposite bars in at least one layer in a way similar to the polar monitors.

In this note, we outlined the principles of a new alignment system for the ATLAS muon spectrometer which uses the same methods for the barrel and endcap regions and offers certain advantages compared to the TP alignment scheme. Details of a straight-forward system upgrade to overcome the mentioned difficulties in the mechanical implementation along the lines explained above will be discussed in a forthcoming note.

Conclusions

The proposed new scheme for the ATLAS muon system alignment has the following advantages.

_In the barrel region_:

* For the correction of the systematic sagitta error due to misalignment, it is possible to use simultaneously two complementary approaches, full reconstruction of relative chamber positions and direct determination of the false sagitta depending on the position of the muon trajectory (in the case of projective polar monitors).
* The required number of (pseudo-) projective monitors is reduced.
* Projectivity of the chamber layout is not required; the chamber dimensions are not constrained by alignment requirements and can be made uniform.
* Holes in the chambers for traversing alignment beams can be avoided completely.
* Chamber positioning tolerances are considerably softened.

_In the end-cap region_:

* The number of required light paths is reduced.
* Holes in the end-cap cryostat can in principle be avoided.
* All end-cap sectors are globally aligned w.r.t. each other.

_In both regions_:

* The potential problem imposed by non-projectivity of particles in the case of \(\sigma_{z}^{IP}\gg 5\) cm is resolved.
* Azimuthal monitors measure directly the two most relevant coordinates of chamber displacements, hence the scheme does not require additional proximity sensors, the number of monitors and monitor technologies is minimized and there is no potential error accumulation problem inherent in the scheme.
* Internal in-plane alignment of individual chambers can be combined with the azimuthal monitoring system.
