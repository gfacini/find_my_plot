### Cross-talk in the 0.5 m Barrel TRT Prototype

Hans Danielsson, Sergei Mouraviev

#### Abstract

Cross-talk measurement on the first ATLAS TRT barrel module is reported. The goal of the study was to estimate the cross-talk over the electrically disconnected anode wire at z\(=\)0 and the cross-talk between neighboring straws. The cross-talk from one side to the other of the anode wire was found to be ~0.5%. Between neighboring straws, the cross-talk was found to be dominated by cross-talk in the tension plate. The 5% with the largest cross-talk, above 5%, were identified by visual inspection of the traces in the tension plate. A typical value for neighboring straws was 1-2%.

## 1 Introduction

The ATLAS barrel TRT consists of three module layers with 32 modules in each layer. Each straw has an anode wire which is electrically disconnected at z = 0 to reduce the occupancy, while the 158 cm long straws (cathode) are continuous [1]. The cross-talk between the two sides should be low in order not to increase the occupancy. In this report, results from cross-talk measurements on a 0.5 m long barrel module prototype are reported. The prototype contains 329 straws from which one HV group (16 straws) is equipped with electrically disconnected wires at z=0. The Tungsten wires have a diameter of 30\({}_{\mathrm{H}}\) and are electrically divided using a 0.8 cm long glass tube with an outer diameter of 240 \(\mathrm{\SIUnitSymbolMicro m}\)[2]. Extensive measurements of the straw properties, including cross-talk, have already been presented in [3].

## 2 Experimental set-up

Three different measurements were performed with two different set-ups:

1. cross-talk on electrically broken wires at z=0 using a Fe\({}^{55}\) source.
2. cross-talk on electrically broken wires using a pulse-generator.
3. cross-talk between straws using a pulse generator.

In the first set-up a gas mixture of 70% Argon and 30 % CO\({}_{2}\) was used and the high voltage was set to 1595 V. This corresponds to a gas gain of \(\sim\) 2.6x10\({}^{4}\). The gas flow through the detector was in this case 15 l/h. A Fe\({}^{55}\) source was placed half way in on one side of the straw to study cross-talk induced on the opposite side (Figure1a). The signal passed a preamplifier and a shaper before arriving to the oscilloscope.

In Figure 1b the connection scheme for the second set-up is shown. A pulse generator was used to produce a square wave with amplitude 1V and a period of T=350 ns. The rise time was measured to be \(\sim\)15 ns. The opposite side of the straw was measured with the oscilloscope.

Figure 2 shows the third experiment. The same square wave as above was used and the rise time of the signal was 15 and 20 ns before and after the straw, respectively, as shown in Figure 3. The signal was sent through different straws with continuous wires marked as R1 to R10 in Figure 4. The cross-talk to neighbouring straws numbered 1.1 to 10.1 was measured with the oscilloscope. As can be seen from

Figure 4, some traces from wire fixation pin to connector are longer. An attempt was made to measure the straws with the longest traces, and therefore the largest possibility of cross-talk.

## Results

### Cross-talk over electrically divided wire.

Figure 5 shows the signal on the source side and this signal was used to trigger the reading of the opposite side of the straw. A threshold of 65 mV was used which corresponds to \(\sim\) 5% of the signal on the opposite side of the straw. No cross-talk could be seen at this threshold. With the pulse generator a few straws, out of the 16 possible, were measured and the cross-talk was found to be less than 0.5% in all cases.

Figure 4: View of the tension plate layout were the signal straws are marked with R1 - R10 and the measured straws with 1.1 - 10.1.

### 2) Cross-talk between different straws

The cross-talk was defined as the ratio between the maximum induced amplitude (E\({}_{c}\)) on a straw, by a pulse with amplitude E\({}_{i}\) on a neighbouring straw, as shown in Figure 6.

The cross-talk between straws was found to be dominated by the cross-talk in the tension plate. Straws far away from each other, were found to have a cross-talk below \(\sim\)1%. If traces in the tension plate were long and close to each other the cross-talk could be as high as ~8%. Neighbouring straws corresponding to well separated traces in the tension plate showed a cross-talk of ~1-2 % i.e., close to that measured for straws far away from each other. Detailed values for different measured straws are given in Table1. Figure 7 shows the correlation between the cross-talk and the dimension less parameter _L/d_ where \(L\) is the length of the traces and \(d\) is the distance between them. The error in the cross-talk measurement is estimated to ~0.5 %.

## Conclusion and Discussion

* The results from the first measurement with the broken wires shows that the cross-talk is below threshold when using the Fe\({}^{55}\) source. The threshold in this case was \(\sim\)5% after the shaper. With the pulse generator the cross-talk was found to be \(<0.5\%\).
* In the second experiment the cross-talk between neighbouring straws was found to be dominated by the cross-talk in the tension plate. A typical value is 1-2% for neighbouring straws, but can be as high as \(\sim\)8% (one straw) if nearby traces in the tension plate are long. It is important to note that channels with very long and close traces were picked out first. By adding measured straws above 5% plus corresponding signal straw in Table 1, it can be estimated that the cross-talk is higher than 5% in \(\sim\)5 % of the channels.
* A typical figure of merit would be to relate the cross-talk to the average _dE/dx_ pulse height of \(\sim\)2 keV expected per straw. If the cross-talk were not to significantly increase the measured noise of \(\sim\)70 eV, then it should not exceed about 2 %. In regions of the tension plate with long traces, as indicated above, a redesign should be considered.
