**Abstract**

This note discusses the possibility to observe a signal from MSSM Higgs boson decays into final states containing four b-jets. Two specific channels are considered: \(b\overline{b}H\) and \(b\overline{b}A\) production with \(H,A\to b\overline{b}\), for large values of \(\rm m_{H}\), \(\rm m_{A}\) and \(\tan\beta\), and \(H\to hh\to b\overline{b}b\overline{b}\) decays for \(150<\rm m_{H}<2\;m_{t}\) and for low values of \(\tan\beta\). Both channels are difficult to extract because of the very large reducible and irreducible QCD backgrounds. Even with an ultimate integrated luminosity of \(3\cdot 10^{5}\) pb\({}^{-1}\), the region of the MSSM parameter space covered by these channels does not extend the reach beyond that accessible to other channels which have been studied in the past. Nevertheless, their observation would help in constraining the couplings and branching ratios of the MSSM Higgs bosons. The difficult issue of triggering efficiently on these channels for low values of \(\rm m_{H}\) is also addressed. This study demonstrates that, although one should not consider the need for a level-2 b-jet trigger as mandatory from the physics point of view, the implementation of such trigger would improve the flexibility and therefore the physics reach of the ATLAS trigger system.

Introduction

One of the most attractive theoretical extensions of the Standard Model (SM) is the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM). Recently, the interest in this model has grown for several reasons. It is the simplest version of low-energy supersymmetry, with the minimal gauge group and particle content compatible with phenomenology. It preserves all SM predictions at low energies, and is therefore not contradicted by any of the precision measurements at LEP. It also has a high level of predictivity in the Higgs sector. At tree level, all Higgs-boson masses and couplings can be expressed in terms of only two parameters, usually chosen to be the ratio of the vacuum expectation values of the two Higgs doublets, \(\tan\beta\), and the mass of the \(A\) boson, \(\mathrm{m}_{\mathrm{A}}\). Radiative corrections introduce a dependence of the masses and couplings on the top-quark mass, the squark masses and the mixing parameters in the stop-sbottom sector. All couplings of the MSSM Higgs bosons to fermions and bosons can be obtained from the SM couplings by multiplying the latter with the appropriate MSSM correction factors, which depend on the parameters listed above.

The MSSM predictions concerning the Higgs-boson masses have important phenomenological consequences. One of the Higgs bosons, the scalar \(h\), is relatively light, with a maximum allowed mass value varying from 105 to 153 GeV, depending on the MSSM parameters and the top-quark mass. The masses of the other Higgs bosons are expected to be larger and nearly degenerate for \(\mathrm{m}_{\mathrm{A}}\ >\ 200\) GeV [1].

There are a variety of production and decay channels through which the MSSM Higgs bosons can be observed. Some of these are similar to the SM, such as the \(H,\ h\ \rightarrow\ \gamma\ \gamma\) or \(H\to 4\ell\) channels. Others are allowed in the SM but have large enough rates only in the MSSM case, i.e. \(H,A\rightarrow\tau\tau,\,\mu\mu,\) and \(t\overline{t}\). There are also channels characteristic of the MSSM, such as \(H^{\pm}\rightarrow\tau\nu,\,A\to Zh,\,H\to hh,\) as well as the production of \(h\) bosons in squark and gluino decays.

The work described in [1] presents an extended and complete study of most of these channels, leading to realistic predictions for the ATLAS discovery potential in the MSSM Higgs sector. Figures 1 and 2 show the final results of [1], namely the \(5\sigma\)-discovery contour curves, for \(\mathrm{m}_{t}\)=175 GeV and for integrated luminosities of \(3\cdot 10^{4}\) pb\({}^{-1}\) and \(3\cdot 10^{5}\) pb\({}^{-1}\), respectively, which represent the integrated luminosities expected for ATLAS after three and ten years of operation. With the initial modest integrated luminosity of \(3\cdot 10^{4}\) pb\({}^{-1}\), a large fraction of the parameter space is already covered. With the ultimate integrated luminosity of \(3\cdot 10^{5}\) pb\({}^{-1}\), the ATLAS discovery potential nearly maps the complete parameter space. For the vast majority of cases, the experiment would be able to distinguish between the SM and MSSM cases.

The MSSM Higgs sector is quite challenging experimentally for the LHC experiments, since, most often, the signal-to-background ratios are much smaller than unity and the detector resolution in several of the accessible channels is far from optimal. This sets stringent requirements on the performance in terms of energy and momentum resolution and of particle identification, but, on the other hand, the variety of channels makes this sector an excellent benchmark to evaluate the discovery potential of the detector. A very good performance of the electromagnetic calorimeter, excellent b-tagging capabilities, good \(E_{T}^{miss}\)-resolution and \(\tau\)-identification are all crucial ingredients to fully explore the MSSM Higgs sector.

Channels with b-jets identified in the final state were considered so far only if associated with hard leptons or photons: \(Wh\) with \(h\to b\overline{b}\), \(H/A\to t\overline{t}\to\ell\nu jjb\overline{b}\), \(A\to Zh\to\ell\ell b\overline{b}\) and \(H\to hh\to b\overline{b}\gamma\gamma\). All of these channels were found to be observable only for low values of \(\tan\beta\). The possibility to improve the sensitivity by using identified b-jet spectators was also recently considered [2] in the case of \(b\overline{b}A,b\overline{b}H\) production with \(H/A\to\tau\tau\) decay. In all these cases however, isolated leptons or photons provide a straightforward experimental trigger and the purely hadronic background from QCD multi-jet production is not a source for concern.

Final states containing more than two b-jets have not been explored so far in these searches. They nevertheless deserve some attention, since they correspond to the dominant production and decay modes of the MSSM Higgs bosons over a large fraction of the parameter space. Also, it has been reported in recent theoretical papers [3] that they should be very promising for discovery in the MSSM Higgs sector.

Two possible channels will be discussed in this paper, both leading to final states containing four b-jets but no lepton nor photon for the experimental trigger:

* the first channel arises from \(b\overline{b}H\) and \(b\overline{b}A\) production, which is strongly enhanced for large values of \(\tan\beta\), since the production rates grow like \(\tan^{2}\beta\). These production processes were studied so far through the \(\tau\tau\) and \(\mu\mu\) decay modes over the mass range from 100 to 500 GeV. The \(\tau\tau\) channel requires excellent \(\tau\)-identification to suppress the huge background of hadronic jets from various sources, but also excellent \(E_{T}^{miss}\)-resolution for the reconstruction of the \(\tau\tau\) invariant mass. The region of parameter space accessible to the \(\tau\tau\) channel, which has a branching ratio of \(\sim 10\%\), is superior to that of the \(\mu\mu\) channel and, for \(\rm m_{A}=300\) GeV, the \(5\sigma\)-discovery contour extends down to \(\tan\beta~{}\sim~{}10\) for an integrated luminosity of \(3\cdot 10^{4}\) pb\({}^{-1}\), and down to \(\tan\beta~{}\sim~{}7\) for an integrated luminosity of \(3\cdot 10^{5}\) pb\({}^{-1}\). For larger masses, the sensitivity degrades rapidly, due to the decreasing production rates and the degradation of the \(\tau\tau\) mass resolution. For \(\rm m_{A}=500\) GeV, the accessible region reaches only down to \(\tan\beta\sim 35\) (resp. \(\sim 25\)) for an integrated luminosity of \(3\cdot 10^{4}\) pb\({}^{-1}\) (resp. \(3\cdot 10^{5}\) pb\({}^{-1}\)). The rates expected for the \(b\overline{b}\) decay mode would be much higher, since the branching ratio is about 90%. However, the observation of final states containing multiple b-jets is very challenging: it requires excellent b-tagging performance and very efficient jet reconstruction;
* the second channel is the \(H\to hh\) decay, which is dominant for low values of \(\tan\beta\) and for \(\rm m_{H}<2m_{t}\). The observation of this channel would be very interesting, since it would correspond to the simultaneous discovery of two MSSM Higgs bosons. The final state\(H\to hh\to bb\gamma\gamma\) has been studied so far.

It provides a straightforward experimental trigger and offers good kinematical constraints and mass resolution for the reconstruction of \(\rm m_{H}\). The expected rates are, however, very low, even when requiring only one identified b-jet in the final state. The sensitivity to this channel decreases as \(\tan\beta\) increases, and the accessible region of parameter space extends up to \(\tan\beta~{}\sim~{}1.5\) for an integrated luminosity of \(3\cdot 10^{4}\) pb\({}^{-1}\) and up to \(\tan\beta~{}\sim~{}3.5\) for an integrated luminosity of \(3\cdot 10^{5}\) pb\({}^{-1}\). The \(H\to hh\to b\overline{b}b\overline{b}\) channel would yield much higher rates, by a factor of almost 1000; however, as already mentioned, the 4-jet final state will be difficult to trigger on and to extract from the huge QCD background.

The main difficulty and uncertainties in the analysis presented here arise from the evaluation of the QCD multi-jet/multi-b-jet backgrounds. There are many sources of uncertainties in the predictions for QCD multi-jet production: the parton density functions, the choice of scale for the strong coupling constant, the calculations of the exact and complete matrix elements, the need for a Monte Carlo algorithm which deals reliably with very rapid variations in some regions of phase space, the hadronisation algorithm, and the higher-order corrections. At tree level, matrix elements for all parton processes with at most five partons in the final state have been calculated and embedded in a Monte Carlo generator called NJETS[4]. However, the parton-flavour information is not accessible in this generator. For the studies presented here, the PYTHIA Monte Carlo generator[5], with its QCD parton-shower modelling and gluon splitting into heavy quarks, has been used, since the flavour content of the jets in the final state is of crucial importance for the evaluation of many of the background processes. Only leading-order terms are controlled in this approach. The uncertainties on the predictions for high-\(\rm p_{T}\) multi-jet final states are therefore estimated to be as high as a factor of 2 to 3.

Two questions are of particular interest in the context of these studies:

\(\bullet\) is it possible, using the \(b\overline{b}H/A\) channel with \(H/A\to b\overline{b}\), to extend the region in parameter space already covered by the \(\tau\tau\) channel, particularly to values of \(\rm m_{A}\) larger than 500 GeV?

\(\bullet\) is it possible, using the \(H\to hh\to b\overline{b}b\overline{b}\) channel, to extend the region in parameter space already covered by the \(H\to hh\to b\overline{b}\gamma\gamma\) channel?

In the process of answering these questions, the trigger rates expected for multi-jet final states are also discussed in this note, with particular emphasis on the case of high-luminosity operation.

Observability of \(H/A\to b\bar{b}\) for large tan \(\beta\)

For large values of m\({}_{\rm H}\) and m\({}_{\rm A}\), the final state in this channel has a very characteristic topology: the two hardest jets in the event come from the \(H/A\to b\bar{b}\) decay, while the softer ones come from the associated \(b\bar{b}\) production and from initial/final-state radiation. These features have been used for the event selection. At least four reconstructed jets are required in the final state, with the three or four jets of highest transverse energy tagged as b-jets. The two jets with the largest transverse energy are used for the reconstruction of the Higgs-boson mass, m\({}_{\rm b\bar{b}}\). The selection criteria have been optimised for each value of m\({}_{\rm A}\) and m\({}_{\rm H}\), chosen from 300 to 900 GeV, as follows:

* at least four reconstructed jets (ordered in decreasing p\({}_{\rm T}\)) with p\({}_{\rm T}\)\({}^{j_{1}}\)\(>\) 50 GeV and p\({}_{\rm T}\)\({}^{j_{2}}\)\(>\) 30 GeV; the thresholds on the two hardest jets are raised to: \(\bullet\) p\({}_{\rm T}\)\({}^{j_{1}}\)\(>\) 100 GeV and p\({}_{\rm T}\)\({}^{j_{2}}\)\(>\) 70 GeV (selection \(S_{300}\)); \(\bullet\) p\({}_{\rm T}\)\({}^{j_{1}}\)\(>\) 200 GeV and p\({}_{\rm T}\)\({}^{j_{2}}\)\(>\) 100 GeV (selection \(S_{500}\)); \(\bullet\) p\({}_{\rm T}\)\({}^{j_{1}}\)\(>\) 250 GeV and p\({}_{\rm T}\)\({}^{j_{2}}\)\(>\) 150 GeV (selection \(S_{700}\)); \(\bullet\) p\({}_{\rm T}\)\({}^{j_{1}}\)\(>\) 300 GeV and p\({}_{\rm T}\)\({}^{j_{2}}\)\(>\) 200 GeV (selection \(S_{900}\));
* the three highest-p\({}_{\rm T}\) jets are required to be tagged as b-jets; an additional tagged b-jet is required in two different approaches: \(\bullet\) in algorithm A, the fourth highest-p\({}_{\rm T}\) jet is chosen; \(\bullet\) in algorithm B, any tagged b-jet among the additional jets is accepted;
* the two highest-p\({}_{\rm T}\) jets are used to reconstruct the m\({}_{\rm b\bar{b}}\) distribution;
* the events are accepted if m\({}_{\rm b\bar{b}}\) falls within \(\pm\) 80 to 100 GeV of the Higgs-boson mass considered; the mass window was chosen to accept approximately 70% of the events.

The detector performance is simulated with the ATLFAST package [6]. For the case of high-luminosity operation, pile-up effects are included (see Section 4), and the reconstructed jet energies are recalibrated as explained in [6]. For the analysis presented here, a rather optimistic b-tagging performance is assumed (see [7] for the most recent results); for the high-luminosity case, an overall b-tagging efficiency of \(\epsilon_{b}\)\(=\) 50% is assumed, with a rejection against c-jets of \(R_{\rm c}\)\(=\) 10 and against light-quark and gluon jets of \(R_{j}\)\(=\) 100. For the low-luminosity case, the b-tagging efficiency is increased to \(\epsilon_{b}\)\(=\) 60% assuming the same rejections against non-b-jets.

### Signal events

The acceptance of the selection \(S_{500}\) increases from 10% to 40% as the Higgs-boson mass increases from 500 to 900 GeV, as shown in Table 1. The three highest-p\({}_{\rm T}\) jets are found to be true b-jets only in 6% to 14% of the events, due to initial/final-state radiation. This proportion decreases to 1.6% to 3.2% of the events if the fourth highest-p\({}_{\rm T}\) jet is also required to be a true b-jet (algorithm A). For algorithm B, the acceptance is improved by about 60%. These rather low acceptances for the signal events are unavoidable to reduce the huge QCD backgrounds to an acceptable level, as discussed in Section 2.2. It was checked for example that, requiring any combination of the reconstructed jets to be identified as b-jets, leads to much worse signal-to-background ratios and significances.

Table 2 shows, for an integrated luminosity of \(3\cdot 10^{5}\) pb\({}^{-1}\), the expected rates of signal events after applying the selection \(S_{500}\) and the b-tagging procedure, for different assumptions on the b-tagging performance in addition to the default one described above. The signal sample is dominated by events containing true b-jets: the contribution from events with at least one mis-identified jet is below 10%, as shown by comparing the results for the default jet rejections with those for an almost infinite rejection, R = 10\({}^{6}\).

### Background events

The background to the \(b\overline{b}H/A\) signal with \(H/A\to b\overline{b}\) decay is completely dominated by QCD multi-jet processes with final states containing a variable number of real b-jets. For the analysis presented here, large samples of background events were generated using PYTHIA, based on the hard-scattering di-jet sub-processes. The hard-scattering process was accompanied by initial-state radiation, which provides one of the sources of additional jets, and gluon splitting and/or final-state radiation also provide a source of additional jets, some of which originate from b-quarks.

The event generation was organised in several \(\rm p_{T}\) bins with different statistics, typically \(5\cdot 10^{4}\) events to \(4\cdot 10^{6}\) events per bin. A sufficiently large number of events were generated in each bin to obtain statistically significant samples after applying the selection criteria for the final states of interest.

As for the signal, the background events were simulated through the ATLFAST package, with pile-up effects included for the high-luminosity case. The b-tagging procedure and the jet energy recalibration were also applied. Table 5 shows the summed production cross-sections and the kinematical acceptances for selection \(S_{500}\) (before applying the b-tagging procedure), for the most prominent background sub-processes: \(b\overline{b}\), \(q\overline{q}\), \(gb\), \(gq\) and \(gg\). The kinematical acceptances are about 0.13% for all the di-jet sub-processes, but the initial cross-sections vary over several orders of magnitude. Fig. 5 shows the contributions from the various \(\rm p_{T}\) bins chosen at generation to the distribution of \(\rm m_{b\overline{b}}\). The relative contributions from the different bins vary rapidly depending on the selection criteria, so the use of this algorithm for the event generation turned out to be rather efficient in this case2. As an example, even though the production cross-sections in the first two bins are different by several orders of magnitude (\(2\,\cdot\,10^{7}\) pb and \(3.5\,\cdot\,10^{4}\) pb respectively),

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:12]

The background estimates presented above explain why the theoretical estimates of [3] are much too optimistic. These estimates were based on an evaluation of the QCD background in final states containing three b-jets using only the contribution from the direct \(gg\to b\overline{b}\) sub-process. As appears clearly in Table 6, this sub-process contributes not more than 10 to 15% of the total background for final states containing at least three identified b-jets. This conclusion was found to be rather independent of the selection cuts applied to the reconstructed jets, as demonstrated by the results of Section 3.1 in Table 12.

Finally, Table 7 shows the total expected background for the different selection cuts, before and after applying the chosen \(\rm m_{b\overline{b}}\) mass window, for an integrated luminosity of \(3\cdot 10^{5}\) pb\({}^{-1}\).

### Expected signal significances

Tables 8 (for an integrated luminosity of \(3\cdot 10^{4}\) pb\({}^{-1}\)) and Tables 9 (for an integrated luminosity of \(3\cdot 10^{5}\) pb\({}^{-1}\)) show the final signal and background rates and expected significances as a function of the selection procedure adopted, for \(\tan\beta~{}=~{}30\) and for four values of the Higgs-boson masses. The selection criteria (\(S_{300}\) to \(S_{900}\)), as well as the mass window for the reconstructed \(\mbox{m}_{\rm b\bar{b}}\); were optimised separately for each mass (a mass window of \(\sim~{}\pm 2\sigma_{m}\) was used).

The overall conclusion is that, even for an integrated luminosity of \(3\cdot 10^{5}\) pb\({}^{-1}\), the extraction of the signal for \(b\bar{b}H/A\) production with \(H/A\to b\bar{b}\) decay will be very difficult. Although the expected rates and significances are higher for a selection requiring only three identified b-jets, it is unlikely that the systematic uncertainties on the background shape can be controlled to the required precision in this case, where the signal-to-background ratio is lowest (S/B \(\sim\) 1%). A selection requiring at least four identified b-jets yields a more favourable signal-to-background ratio of \(\sim\) 3% and also a more favourable ratio (of \(\sim\) 67%) of irreducible-to-total background3. As mentioned previously, this latter ratio can be easily extracted from the numbers given in Table 6 for R = \(10^{6}\) and R = \(10^{2}\).

Footnote 3: The irreducible background consists of the events containing the required number of identified true b-jets

For a selection requiring four identified b-jets and for an integrated luminosity of \(3\cdot 10^{5}\) pb\({}^{-1}\), a nominal significance larger than 5\(\sigma\) could be achieved for \(\tan\beta~{}>\) 29 (\(\mbox{m}_{\rm H}\) = 500 GeV) and for \(\tan\beta~{}>\) 20 (\(\mbox{m}_{\rm H}\) = 300 GeV). This coverage in the parameter space can be compared to that of the \(\tau\tau\) channel, which extends down to \(\tan\beta~{}>~{}25\) (\(\mbox{m}_{\rm H}\) = 500 GeV) and to \(\tan\beta~{}>~{}8\) (\(\mbox{m}_{\rm H}\) = 300 GeV). For an integrated luminosity of \(3\cdot 10^{4}\) pb\({}^{-1}\), the respective lower limits on \(\tan\beta\) are \(\tan\beta~{}>~{}42\) and \(\tan\beta~{}>~{}30\) for the \(b\bar{b}\) channel, and \(\tan\beta~{}>~{}33\) and \(\tan\beta~{}>~{}11\) for the \(\tau\tau\) channel.

It should be stressed again that the sensitivities quoted for the \(b\bar{b}\) channel are rather on the optimistic side, since the estimates of the QCD background are very uncertain (the PYTHIA results could be under-estimated by a factor of 3, as discussed in Section 4) and the assumptions used for the b-tagging performance are more optimistic than the results from recent work for the Inner Detector Performance TDR [7]. In addition, systematic uncertainties due to the lack of knowledge of the background shape have not been taken into account in the significance estimates of Tables 8 and 9.

### Signal events

Two points in the MSSM parameter space were chosen for a detailed study of this channel: \(\rm m_{H}=300\,GeV\) with \(\tan\beta=\)1.5 and \(\tan\beta=3.0\), corresponding respectively to \(\rm m_{h}=77.8\,\,GeV\) and \(\rm m_{h}=98\,\,GeV\) (2-loop calculation). The final state in this channel can be fully reconstructed with good mass resolution through the use of the constraint, \(\rm m_{b\bar{b}}=m_{h}\). Four identified b-jets are required with two \(b\bar{b}\) combinations reconstructed with \(\rm m_{b\bar{b}}\) close to \(\rm m_{h}\). As shown also in [8], with the expected ATLAS calorimeter performance, a signal acceptance of 70% to 80% can be achieved using a mass window, \(\rm m_{b\bar{b}}=m_{h}\pm 25\,\,GeV\), for the h-boson reconstruction and, after applying the constraint on \(\rm m_{h}\), a mass window, \(\rm m_{b\bar{b}b\bar{b}}=m_{H}\pm 20\,\,GeV\).

As described already in Section 2, the detector performance is simulated with the ATLFAST package, pile-up effects are included for the high-luminosity case, which is discussed first below, and a randomised b-tagging procedure is applied to the reconstructed jets after recalibrating their four-momenta.

For the signal events, the jet transverse-energy spectrum is rather hard, with \(\rm<\)\(\rm p_{T}\)\({}^{j_{1}}\)\(>\) = 100 GeV and \(\rm<\)\(\rm p_{T}\)\({}^{j_{4}}\)\(>\) = 36 GeV for jets within the Inner Detector acceptance for b-tagging. For the high-luminosity case, at least four jets reconstructed with \(\rm p_{T}\)\(>\) 40 GeV (before energy recalibration) are required, yielding an acceptance of \(\sim\) 25% for the signal events. Table 10 shows the expected signal rates for two different jet-selection algorithms described below:

* Algorithm A: \(\bullet\) the four most energetic jets are required to be identified as b-jets; \(\bullet\) all possible \(b\bar{b}\) combinations are then reconstructed; \(\bullet\) the best pair of combinations for the reconstruction of \(\rm m_{h}\) is chosen by minimising \(\rm\chi^{2}=(m_{b\bar{b},1}\ -\ m_{h})^{2}+(m_{b\bar{b},2}\ -\ m_{h})^{2}\); \(\bullet\) both pairs are required to satisfy \(\rm m_{b\bar{b}}=m_{h}\pm 25\,\,GeV\); \(\bullet\) the event is accepted if \(\rm m_{b\bar{b}b\bar{b}}=m_{H}\pm 20\,\,GeV\) after applying a constraint on \(\rm m_{h}\).
* Algorithm B: \(\bullet\) all possible \(jj\) combinations inside the Inner Detector acceptance are considered; \(\bullet\) the best pair of combinations for the reconstruction of \(\rm m_{h}\) is chosen by minimising \(\rm\chi^{2}=(m_{ij,1}\ -\ m_{h})^{2}+(m_{ij,2}\ -\ m_{h})^{2}\); \(\bullet\) all four jets chosen in this way are required to be identified as b-jets; \(\bullet\) both pairs are required to satisfy \(\rm m_{b\bar{b}}=m_{h}\pm 25\,\,GeV\);\(\bullet\) the event is accepted if \(\rm m_{b\,5b\overline{b}}=m_{H}\)\(\pm\) 20 GeV after applying a constraint on \(\rm m_{h}\).

A careful comparison of these algorithms with other possible selection methods has shown that Algorithm B is close to optimal.

### Background events

As in Section 2.2, the background events arise dominantly from QCD multi-jet production and were simulated through the ATLFAST package. Table 11 shows the expected rates of reconstructed multi-jet background events for the various QCD sub-processes and for an integrated luminosity of \(3\cdot 10^{5}\) pb\({}^{-1}\). This Table also shows the contributions from events containing one or more true b-jets to each of the sub-processes; for the dominant \(gg\) sub-process, only 0.01% of the events contain four true b-jets in the final state, whereas this factor increases to 0.8 % for the direct \(b\overline{b}\) sub-process. Nevertheless, since the production cross-sections differ by two orders of magnitude, the direct \(b\overline{b}\) production process contributes only \(\sim 10\) % of the total QCD background after having required four tagged b-jets, as shown in Table 12. The dominant background is from the \(gb\) sub-process, and the irreducible background from four true b-jets is shown to amount to \(\sim 70\)% of the total multi-jet background. This can be deduced from a comparison of the expected background rates in Table 12 for \(R\,=\,10^{6}\) (almost infinite rejection of non-b-jets) and for \(R\,=\,10^{2}\) (default b-tagging performance). This is also illustrated in Fig. 7 which displays the mass distributions expected for the candidate \(h\to b\overline{b}\) decays for the three dominant sub-processes and for the events accepted by algorithm \(B\). Finally, Table 13 shows the expected rates of background events at each step of the selection procedures described as Algorithms \(A\) and \(B\).

### Significance

Table 14 shows, for both algorithms \(A\) and \(B\), the expected signal and background rates for \(\mbox{m}_{\rm H}=300\) GeV, for \(\mbox{$\tan\beta$}=\)1.5 and 3.0, and for an integrated luminosity of \(3\cdot 10^{5}\) pb\({}^{-1}\). Algorithm \(B\) yields a significantly better signal-to-background ratio and thereby sensitivity, due to the fact that b-jets from \(H\to hh\to b\overline{b}b\overline{b}\) decays are not very often the hardest jets in the event.

The \(m_{b\overline{b}}\) and \(m_{b\overline{b}b\overline{b}}\) mass distributions for both the signal and background events selected by algorithm \(B\) are shown in Fig. 8 and Fig. 9 before the relevant mass cuts are applied. Fig. 10 shows the distributions of \(p_{T}^{b\overline{b}}\), \(p_{T}^{b\overline{b}b\overline{b}}\), \(p_{T}^{b_{1}}\) and \(p_{T}^{b_{4}}\) before energy recalibration for the accepted signal and background events. After applying the selection cuts of algorithm \(B\), these distributions do not differ sufficiently between signal and the background to justify further optimisation of the selection cuts.

A sensitivity similar to that expected for the \(H\to hh\to b\overline{b}\gamma\gamma\) channel (see Fig. 2) appears to be also achievable in this channel, due to its larger rate, but this would require triggering on four-jet events at high luminosity with \(p_{T}^{jet}>40\) GeV and \(|\eta|\,<2.5\). As shown in Section 4, the expected trigger rates are very uncertain, in the range between 1.6 and 4.5 kHz for PYTHIA and NJETS respectively (before energy recalibration), and also too high to be accepted without further cuts at level-2. The possibility of using b-tagging to reduce the rate should be investigated and compared to other simpler possibilities involving somewhat tighter cuts.

This channel has also been studied in the low-luminosity case to evaluate the possible gain in sensitivity which could be achieved by lowering the jet \(E_{T}\)-threshold. The results of this study are shown, for algorithm \(B\), for \(\mbox{$\tan\beta$}=3.0\) and for an integrated luminosity of \(3\cdot 10^{5}\) pb\({}^{-1}\), in Table 15 as a function of the jet \(E_{T}\)-threshold, which was varied from its minimum realistic value (before recalibration) of 15 GeV to the high-luminosity value of 40 GeV. The background rates decrease much faster than the signal rates and the sensitivity improves as the jet \(E_{T}\)-threshold is raised. For a threshold of 20 GeV, Fig. 11 shows the distributions of \(p_{T}^{b\overline{b}}\), \(p_{T}^{b\overline{b}b\overline{b}}\), \(p_{T}^{b_{1}}\) and \(p_{T}^{b_{4}}\) for the accepted signal and background events: requiring a cut on \(p_{T}^{b\overline{b}}\), typically \(p_{T}^{b\overline{b}}\,>60\) GeV, would obviously improve the signal sensitivity. As an illustration, Table 15 also shows the resulting expected signal and background rates as well as the signal-to-background ratios and signal significances, for events with \(p_{T}^{b\overline{b}}\,>60\) GeV and with \(p_{T}^{b_{1}}\,>80\) GeV, as a function of the jet \(E_{T}\)-threshold.

Even with optimised cuts, the sensitivity at low luminosity is weaker than that for the \(H\to hh\to b\overline{b}\gamma\gamma\) channel, and the trigger requirements become very demanding, since an \(E_{T}\)-threshold of about 20 GeV would be desirable.

structure functions, etc. It is hoped that some indication of their magnitude can be obtained by comparing the results of the two Monte Carlo generators.

These results are shown for the multi-jet trigger rates in Tables 17 and 16 for PYTHIA and NJETS respectively. The rates were calculated for events with at least three jets and four jets for transverse-energy thresholds from 30 to 50 GeV. For completeness, Table 18 shows the trigger rates expected for dijet events as obtained from PYTHIA.

Several conclusions can be drawn from these Tables:

\(\bullet\) there is quite a large discrepancy between the estimates from PYTHIA and NJETS. This discrepancy increases from a factor of \(\sim 2.5\) for \(p_{T}~{}>~{}50\) GeV to a factor of \(\sim 3.2\) for \(p_{T}~{}>~{}30\) GeV. PYTHIA systematically gives lower rates, a well-known feature of the parton-shower approach, which often tends to generate jet spectra which are too soft. As an example, a similar effect was observed [11] when comparing the jet \(p_{T}\)-spectrum for \(W\)+ jet events as obtained from PYTHIA to that obtained from VECBOS [12].

\(\bullet\) the multi-jet trigger rates are therefore uncertain by at least a factor of 3. It should be noted that the rates shown here are for reconstructed jets before energy recalibration, therefore these rates do not correspond to the 90% trigger efficiency at threshold.

\(\bullet\) to maintain the level-2 trigger rate safely below \(\sim 100\) Hz without additional cuts or selection would require thresholds of 50-60 GeV for four-jet events at low luminosity. At high luminosity, these thresholds would have to be raised by about 40 GeV.

This first study of event topologies containing four b-jets in the search for MSSM Higgs-boson decays has shown that it will be very difficult to cleanly extract the signal above the background over a significant region of the MSSM parameter space. The results of this note are much less optimistic than those from [3], because the study reported in [3] did not consider all processes leading to multiple b-jets in the final state, nor did it consider the significant fraction of fake b-jets to be expected in such complex topologies. The study reported here was particularly difficult to bring to a conclusion since more than \(2\times 10^{7}\) background events had to be generated and processed through ATLFAST.

From this note, one can certainly conclude that the physics channels studied here do not suggest that ATLAS needs a b-jet trigger at level-2 although such a trigger, if feasible, could enhance slightly the ATLAS potential in the SUSY Higgs sector, in particular in terms of Higgs branching ratio measurements. It should be stressed that the physics goals could be achieved with a modest performance of b-jet tagging at level-2, but that the main difficulty in designing such a trigger resides in the requirement that its inefficiency for the signal b-jets of interest should overlap as completely as possible with that of the more refined offline analysis.
