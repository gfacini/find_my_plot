**Prospects for Supersymmetry and Univeral Extra Dimensions discovery based on inclusive searches at a 10 TeV centre-of-mass energy with the ATLAS detector**

The ATLAS collaboration

This note presents an evaluation of the discovery potential of Supersymmetry and Universal Extra Dimensions for channels with jets, leptons and missing transverse energy. The LHC running scenario at a centre-of-mass energy of 10 TeV, delivering an integrated luminosity of 200 pb\({}^{-1}\) for the 2009-2010 run is investigated.

Introduction

Supersymmetry (SUSY) 1 and models with a Universal Extra Dimension (UED) [2] are theoretically favoured candidates for physics beyond the Standard Model. Cosmological arguments suggest that the lightest UED or SUSY particle is stable and weakly interacting and so would escape detection in ATLAS.

Footnote 1: An introduction to SUSY can e.g. be found in [1].

This note describes prospects for new phenomena searches in channels with a combination of jets, leptons and missing transverse energy. Signals investigated in this study are from various SUSY scenarios with R-parity conservation and a UED scenario with Kaluza-Klein-parity conservation. Both studies assume an LHC centre-of-mass energy \(\sqrt{s}\) of 10 TeV and an integrated luminosity \(\mathcal{L}=200\) pb\({}^{-1}\).

The searches for generic SUSY signatures with R-parity conservation are performed by searching for an excess of events in various channels. These channels explore a large variety of possible signals, e.g. different jet (\(\geq 2\), \(\geq 3\), \(\geq 4\)) and lepton (0,1,2,3) multiplicities as well as channels with taus and photons [3]. This note extends the ATLAS result for \(\sqrt{s}=14\) TeV and \(\mathcal{L}=~{}1\)fb\({}^{-1}\) presented in [3] for channels with \(\geq 2\), \(\geq 3\) or \(\geq 4\) jets and 0-2 leptons. The goal of this study is also to show that the cuts proposed in [3], with a slight modification of the cuts in transverse momentum and missing transverse energy due to the reduced \(\sqrt{s}\), can lead to an early discovery for a broad range of SUSY models. This article relies on work published in [3], where the background estimation for SUSY searches is discussed.

To increase the range of parameters studied we consider also models in the phenomenological minimal supersymmetric Standard Model (pMSSM) and SUSY look alike scenarios such as Universal Extra Dimensions.

This note is organized as follows: the second section describes briefly the Monte Carlo generation of SUSY and UED models, the third section the generation of background processes, the fourth and fifth section presents the object identification and event selection. Finally we discuss the discovery potential of the various models.

## 2 Monte Carlo simulation of SUSY and UED events

In the following we briefly describe our simulation of event samples in a model, where SUSY breaking is mediated by gravitational interaction (mSUGRA), pMSSM and UED models. All studied scenarios assume that the R-parity quantum number (for SUSY) or the corresponding Kaluza Klein (KK) quantum number (for UED) is conserved. SUSY (UED) particles are thus produced in pairs and each particle then decays into states which include the lightest SUSY or KK particle (LSP or LKP respectively). Since there is no unique model of SUSY-breaking, all these models should be viewed only as possible patterns of LHC signatures, not as complete theories.

Table 1 summarizes the Monte Carlo generators and detector simulation used for all signal samples. The top mass was set to 172.5 GeV for all samples. The PYTHIA (HERWIG) cross sections were used for the pMSSM (mSUGRA) points. The cross sections for the UED model were calculated using PYTHIA.

The signal points are simulated with fast simulations of the ATLAS detector. ATLFAST1 [4] has been developed for physics parameter space scans and studies that do not require the level of detail contained in the full simulation. Truth objects are smeared by detector resolutions to provide physics objects similar to those of the reconstruction.

Footnote 1: An introduction to SUSY can e.g. be found in [1].

A second fast simulation, ATLFAST2 [4], is used to supplement full simulation studies. It includes a GEANT4 simulation of the inner detector and muon system supplemented by a fast calorimeter simulation. ATLFAST2 was used to provide large statistics of background events and to simulate some of the signal samples.

mSUGRA gridsIn the mSUGRA model SUSY breaking is mediated by gravitational interactions. The mSUGRA model is defined by 5 parameters: the common boson mass at the GUT scale \(m_{0}\), the common fermion mass at the GUT scale \(m_{1/2}\), the ratio of the Higgs vacuum expectation values \(\tan\beta\), the common GUT scale trilinear coupling \(A_{0}\) and the sign of the Higgs potential parameter \(\mu\).

In order to cover a large parameter space and to reduce the number of SUSY points mSUGRA grids were made in "radial coordinates", i.e. points on outgoing radial lines in the \((m_{0},m_{1/2})\) plane for \(\tan\beta=10\) and 50. Lines with different slopes in the \((m_{0},m_{1/2})\) plane were produced. The other mSUGRA parameters are set to the same values as in [3], i.e. \(A_{0}=0\), \(\mu>0\).

The SUSY spectra were generated with ISAJET 7.75 [5]. The samples were generated using HERWIG 6.5 [6, 7] and simulated using the ATLFAST2 simulation.

pMSSM points fulfilling constraints from experimentsThese points are generated in the phenomenological MSSM (pMSSM) with 19 free soft SUSY breaking parameters. In Ref. [8] this parameter space was sampled with a flat prior distribution within certain theoretical limits and a scale of all MSSM mass parameters \(<1\) TeV (so called flat prior grid). Only points are chosen which satisfy various experimental bounds such as those from collider experiments at LEP and Tevatron, the WMAP dark matter density upper bound and bounds from direct Dark Matter detection searches [8]. For about 200 randomly selected points events were generated with PYTHIA 6.4 and simulated with the ATLFAST1 detector simulation.

41 points with a mass difference between the \(\chi^{0}\) and \(\chi^{+}\) of 300 MeV or less were removed from the production as they lead to long-lived charginos which cause problems in the PYTHIA fragmentation and are not simulated within ATLFAST1. This part of parameter space may be covered by dedicated analyses for long-lived massive particles. Figure 1 shows various distributions for the 150 produced points.

Universal Extra DimensionsIn the universal extra dimensions (UED) model [2] the Standard Model fields can propagate into 4 + \(\delta\) dimensions, the extra dimensions being compactified at a scale \(1/R>300\) GeV. From a phenomenological point of view there are many parallels between the UED and SUSY models. Similarly to SUSY each SM field has a Kaluza-Klein partner that, in contrast to SUSY, has the same spin. This results in higher quark-type cross sections for the UED model, since the spin 1/2 KK-quarks of the UED have a higher production cross section than the spin 0 squarks of SUSY.

Momentum conservation in the universal dimensions implies the conservation of a KK quantum number - the KK parity, so that KK particles are also always produced in pairs. Heavier KK-particles successively decay into the lightest KK particle (LKP) and SM particles. The LKP escapes the detection leading to missing transverse energy. The masses of all UED particles are of order \(1/R\) and the signature of this model is therefore almost identical to that of MSSM models with a very compressed SUSY particle mass spectrum.

In the framework of this analysis we studied the Minimal UED scenario with one additional extra dimension (\(\delta=1\)) as implemented in the PYTHIA 6.4 Monte Carlo generator [9, 10]. Only points with \(1/R\leq 1000\) GeV were considered as the cross section vanishes for small compactification scales. The

mass splitting in the KK excitation spectrum is determined by the cut-off parameter \(\Lambda\cdot R\) which was set to 20. Points have been produced with \(1/R=300,400,500,600,700,800,900\) and 1000 GeV.

## 3 Monte Carlo simulation of background processes

The Standard Model background processes most relevant to SUSY searches are \(t\bar{t}\), \(W+\mathrm{jets}\), \(Z+\mathrm{jets}\), single top, diboson and QCD jet production. Top pair production, single top and diboson samples are based on a full simulation of the ATLAS detector using the GEANT4 [11] program, the remaining samples were simulated with ATLFAST2. A summary of the Standard Model datasets is given in Table 2.

Single top and top pair productionThe \(t\bar{t}\) process is the dominant background for most of the SUSY channels studied here. The MC@NLO [12, 13] generator, including full NLO QCD corrections has been used to simulate the hard process. Parton showering and fragmentation were simulated by the

Shown are the mass of the gluino versus the mass of the light squarks (top left), the distribution of \(\tan\beta\) (top right), the mass of the \(\chi^{1}_{0}\) (middle left) and the mass of the \(\tilde{t}_{1}\) (middle right). The lowest plot shows the distribution of the various types of nLSP for the same pMSSM models.

HERWIG+JIMMY [6, 14, 15] generator. The \(t\bar{t}\) cross sections were normalized to the NLO+NLL result [16].

In addition to the \(t\bar{t}\) process, single top production was simulated with the ACERMC [17] generator.

W/Z + jets productionThe vector boson production of W and Z plus jets are important backgrounds for Supersymmetric searches both with and without leptons. As the SUSY event selection often requires many jets in the final state, it is particularly important to correctly produce the kinematics of multiparton final states. For this reason, the ALPGEN [18] MC generator including LO electroweak and QCD effects for multiparton hard processes has been chosen. Jet production was generated using up to 5 parton Matrix Elements. The generator is interfaced to HERWIG for showering and fragmentation processes.

QCD jet productionFor reasons similar to those discussed above, for the generation of W/Z +jets events, the use of multiparton generators is desirable for QCD production. A large sample of QCD events has been generated with the ALPGEN MC generator. The generation was split according to the type of quark produced (b-quarks or light quarks) and the \(P_{T}\) of the leading jet. Jet production was generated here using up to 5 parton Matrix Elements for light quarks and up to 4 parton Matrix Elements

The samples \(ZZ\) and \(WZ\) were simulated with the MC@NLO generator, whereas the gg2WW [19] generator was used for \(WW\) production.

## 4 Lepton, jet and missing transverse energy reconstruction

A general search strategy for standard SUSY signatures would be the selection of events with large missing transverse energy and reconstructed particles with large transverse momentum. At the LHC these objects are predominantly jets since the coupling strength of the strong force would cause an abundance of squarks and gluinos if these particles are not prohibitively heavy. Squarks or gluinos will cascade decay to jets, leptons or photons, depending on the SUSY parameters, and missing transverse energy caused by the LSPs and neutrinos. Analogous arguments also hold for the UED model. In order to classify events in different exclusive channels, the same object identification criteria are used for all channels.

### Object selection

The following object selection defines particle candidates used in the event selection. The object selection criteria are similar to the ones used in Ref. [3].

**Jets**: are reconstructed with a narrow cone algorithm (cone size of 0.4) to take into account the typical large multiplicity of supersymmetric events. The jet algorithm is run on calorimeter "towers". Two acceptance cuts are required in addition: \(P_{T}>20\) GeV and \(|\eta|<2.5\) to ensure a good jet calibration.
**Electrons**: are reconstructed and identified with the so-called "medium" purity cuts [3]. In particular, "medium" cuts include isolation criteria which are \(E_{T}\) dependent. In addition to those standard cuts, the \(P_{T}\) of electrons should exceed 10 GeV and \(|\eta|\) should be less than 2.5.
**Muons**: are reconstructed by an algorithm which performs a statistical combination of a track reconstructed in the muon spectrometer with its corresponding track in the inner detector [3]. When combining tracks from the inner detector and the muon spectrometer the one with the best match is taken, if more than one inner detector track is found. In order to select isolated muons, the total calorimeter energy within a cone of \(\Delta R<0.2\) should be less than 10 GeV. Finally the standard acceptance cuts of \(P_{T}>10\) GeV and \(|\eta|<2.5\) are used.
**Missing transverse energy**: is computed from calorimeter cells with calibration weights which are object dependent, and corrected for (well reconstructed) muons [3].

### Overlap removal

When candidates passing the object selection overlap each other, a classification is required to remove all but one of the overlapping objects. All overlapping criteria are based on the simple geometric \(\Delta R=\sqrt{\Delta\phi^{2}+\Delta\eta^{2}}\) variable and applied in the following order [3] :

1. If an electron and a jet are found within \(\Delta R<0.2\), keep the electron and reject the jet.

2. If a muon and a jet are found within \(\Delta R<0.4\), keep the jet and reject the muon
3. If an electron and a jet are found within \(0.2\leq\Delta R<0.4\), keep the jet and reject the electron.

## 5 Event selection

In this note we study different channels where the number of jets ranges from \(\geq 2\) to \(\geq 4\) and the number of leptons can vary from 0 to 2. The word lepton is used to denote isolated electrons and muons. Analysis channels with different lepton multiplicity requirements are mutually exclusive. The selection criteria are looser than in the previous studies [3] since the analysis has a target luminosity of 200 pb\({}^{-1}\) and a lower centre-of-mass energy of 10 TeV.

In all channels, events are vetoed if an electron passes the object selection in the electromagnetic calorimeter transition region \(1.37<|\eta|<1.52\). The cut is applied to exclude electrons reconstructed in the barrel-endcap transition region of the electromagnetic calorimeter that will not be properly calibrated with early data.

The following event variables will be needed in the discussion of the cuts applied in the various search channels, to be discussed below:

**Effective mass**: \((M_{eff})\) is the scalar sum of transverse momenta of all main objects and is defined as:

\[M_{eff}\equiv\sum_{i=1}^{N_{jets}}P_{T}^{\rm jet,\,i}+\sum_{i=1}^{N_{lep}}P_{ T}^{\rm lep,\,i}+E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}\]

where \(N_{jets}\) is the number of jets (2-4) and \(N_{lep}\) is the number of leptons (0-2) defining the analysis. Other high \(P_{T}\) jets or leptons are not included in the sum.
**Transverse mass**: \((M_{T})\) is definded for channels with exactly 1 lepton as:

\[M_{T}=\sqrt{2\cdot P_{T}^{\rm lep}\cdot E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}\cdot(1-\cos\Delta \phi)}\]

where \(\Delta\phi\) is the angle between the lepton and the missing energy in the plane perpendicular to the beam axis.
**Transverse sphericity**: \((S_{T})\) is defined as:

\[S_{T}\equiv\frac{2\lambda_{2}}{(\lambda_{1}+\lambda_{2})}\]

where \(\lambda_{1}\) and \(\lambda_{2}\) are the eigenvalues of the \(2\times 2\) sphericity tensor \(S_{ij}=\sum_{k}p_{ki}p^{kj}\) computed from all selected jets and leptons.

The cuts on the number of jets and on the transverse momentum of jets are common to the channels with different lepton multiplicities. These cuts are summarized in Table 3. The \(P_{T}\) cuts on the jets are chosen in order to be in accordance with the multijet trigger requirements and in order to reject a sufficient amount of QCD jet background.

In the following we describe the event selection criteria for the 0, 1 and 2 lepton channels.

Zero-lepton channelsIn addition to the electron crack veto, the pre-selection cuts are :

1. Reject events with at least one lepton having \(P_{T}>20\) GeV.
2. Cut on the number of jets and jet transverse momemta as defined in Table 3.
3. Missing transverse energy \(E_{T}^{miss}>80\) GeV.
4. Cut on ratio \(f\) between \(E_{T}^{miss}\) and \(M_{eff}\) as defined in Table 3.
5. Cut on \(\Delta\phi\left(jet_{i},E_{T}^{miss}\right)\) as defined in Table 3.
6. Transverse sphericity, \(S_{T}>0.2\).

One-lepton channelsIn addition to the electron crack veto, the pre-selection cuts are :

1. One lepton with \(P_{T}>20\) GeV, no additional lepton with \(P_{T}>10\) GeV.
2. Cut on the number of jets and jet transverse momemta as defined in Table 3.
3. Missing transverse energy \(E_{T}^{miss}>80\) GeV.
4. Cut on ratio \(f\) between \(E_{T}^{miss}\) and \(M_{eff}\) as defined in Table 3.
5. Cut on \(\Delta\phi(jet_{i},E_{T}^{miss})\) as defined in Table 3.
6. Transverse sphericity, \(S_{T}>0.2\).
7. Transverse mass, \(M_{T}>100\) GeV.

Two-leptons channelsThe two-leptons channel is further subdivided in events with two same sign leptons (SS) and two opposite sign leptons (OS). In this note, only channels with two opposite sign leptons are studied. The analysis with same two sign leptons can be found in [20]. In addition to the electron crack veto, the pre-selection cuts are :

1. Two leptons with \(P_{T}>10\) GeV and opposite charge.
2. Cut on the number of jets and jet transverse momemta as defined in Table 3.
3. Missing transverse energy \(E_{T}^{miss}>80\) GeV.
4. Cut on \(\Delta\phi(jet_{i},E_{T}^{miss})\) as defined in Table 3.
5. Cut on ratio \(f\) between \(E_{T}^{miss}\) and \(M_{eff}\) as defined in Table 3.
6. Transverse sphericity, \(S_{T}>0.2\).

The number of background events passing all preselection cuts is shown in figure 2.

Trigger EfficiencyThe trigger efficiency has been studied for the initial LHC running scenario. For all channels the currently implemented 1, 3 and 4-jet triggers alone yield a efficiency of \(>95\%\) for a luminosity of \(1\times 10^{31}\rm cm^{-2}s^{-1}\). Combined jet and missing transverse energy triggers can yield a \(>95\%\) efficiency for luminosities of \(1\times 10^{32}\rm cm^{-2}s^{-1}\). For simplicity we assume in the following study a trigger efficiency of 100%.

## 6 Results

### Distributions

Since it is impossible to scan the high dimensional SUSY or UED parameter space by developing optimal cuts for each parameter point we pursue the signal search by a parameter-independent approach. The \(M_{\rm eff}\) distribution, which yields best performance [3], is used to search for a deviation between SM+SIGNAL and the SM expectation.

Kinematic distributions are shown for illustrative purpose using events from the SU4 mSUGRA point. SU4 is a low mass point close to the Tevatron bound with \(m_{0}=200\) GeV, \(m_{1/2}=160\) GeV, \(A_{0}=-400\) GeV, \(\tan\beta=10\) and \(\mu>0\). The cross section for SU4 is 108 pb.

0-lepton channelsDistributions of the effective mass for the 0-lepton channels are presented in Figure 3. Figure 4 shows the distributions of the missing transverse energy for the SM backgrounds for the 4 jet channel. The Z and W background dominates the 2-jet selection, whereas for events with 3 and 4 selected jets the background is dominated by top pair production.

1-lepton channelsThe effective mass \(M_{eff}\) distributions are shown in Figure 5 for all 1-lepton channels. Figure 6 shows the transverse mass distribution for the 4-jet 1-lepton channel. A cut \(M_{T}>100\) GeV suppresses effectively the background from top and W production.

The dominating background for the 2-jet channels is top pair production with an important contribution from W+jets in the low jet multiplicity channels. The background from single top production is larger than the background from Z. Diboson processes and the background from QCD events are very small for all jet multiplicities.

2-lepton with opposite sign charge channelsThe effective mass distributions for the 2-lepton channels with opposite sign (OS) charge are shown in Figure 7. The background in the opposite sign channels consists mainly of top-pairs and diboson productions. Although no Z mass veto was applied the background from Z production was found to be small.

### Discovery reach

The discovery reach was calculated using the same approach as in [3]. The reach plots in this subsection are all made by finding the optimal \(M_{eff}\) cut (in steps of 400 GeV) to maximize the significance \(Z_{N}\). The significance \(Z_{N}\) was calculated using a convolution of a Poisson and a Gaussian term to account for a systematic error. For a detailed explanation of the statistical procedure see [3] page 1590-1591.

The uncertainty in the determination of the sum of the various backgrounds was estimated in Ref. [3] for \(\mathcal{L}=1\text{fb}^{-1}\) to be \(\pm 20\%\) for W, Z and top production and \(\pm 50\%\) for QCD processes. For an initial sample with smaller integrated luminosity at \(\sqrt{s}=10\) TeV, these uncertainties need to be reevaluated. The uncertainty on the background as determined with data-driven methods has a statistical component, due to the finite size of the control samples, and a systematic component, due to detector performance uncertainties or uncertainties on correction factors. We compensate part of the loss of statistics in the control samples by making looser cuts on transverse momementum and missing transverse energy, as defined in Table 3. The systematic error is re-estimated accounting for the expected detector performance uncertainties in early data. Overall, we calculate an expected uncertainty of 50% (statistical+systematical) on the W, Z and top backgrounds when these are estimated with data-driven methods. The QCD background is not dominant for all channels and the uncertainty was estimated in Ref. [3] to be \(\pm 60\%\) for a PYTHIA sample equivalent to \(23.8\text{pb}^{-1}\). Data-driven background estimation will be a main topic of study in early data; we take an overall uncertainty of 50% in this note.

In the following plots we have only shown the channels with the largest discovery reach for each lepton multiplicity. No attempt was made to combine the significance of the various channels.

mSUGRAFigure 8 and 9 show the \(5\sigma\) discovery reach for the mSUGRA model with \(\tan\beta=10\) and \(\tan\beta=50\) respectively for the 4 jet 0 lepton, the 4 jet 1 lepton and the 2 jet 2 lepton channels. The discovery reach for the 2 lepton channel with same sign charge is taken from Ref. [20].

pMSSM fulfilling constraints from experimentsFigure 10 shows the \(5\sigma\) discovery reach for the pMSSM grid with constraints as a function of the total cross section and the minimal mass of the first, second and third generation squarks and the gluino (upper plot). The lower plot shows the discovery reach as a function of the minimal mass of the first and second generation squarks and the mass of the gluino. Most considered SUSY signals can be discovered with the 4 jet channels if the cross section is larger than 10 pb and for squark and gluino masses up to 600 GeV. A few points are only found with the 2 or 3 jet channels with 0 or 1 lepton.

We observe that in general the 0-lepton selections are more effective than the 1-lepton selections. Many points do not lead to significant high \(p_{T}\) lepton production. Furthermore, some low mass points can not be discovered with any of the signatures under study. This is due to the fact that for these points the effective mass distributions have a similar shape as the SM backgrounds, and with a 50% uncertainty that we assign to the background these points need more than 200pb\({}^{-1}\) for a \(5\sigma\) discovery.

Universal Extra DimensionsFigure 11 shows the discovery reach for the UED model as a function of \(1/R\), for the 3 jet 0-lepton channel, the 2 jet 1 lepton and the 2 jet channel with 2 leptons with opposite sign charge. The largest discovery reach is found in the 3 jet 0 lepton channel. A \(5\sigma\) significance can be achieved up to \(1/R\approx 700\) GeV with this channel.

## 7 Summary and conclusion

The background compositions and the discovery potential for inclusive SUSY search channels with 0, 1 or 2 opposite sign leptons and \(\geq 2\), \(\geq 3\) or \(\geq 4\) jets have been investigated for a scenario assuming an LHC centre-of-mass energy \(\sqrt{s}\) of 10 TeV and an integrated luminosity of \(\mathcal{L}=200\)pb\({}^{-1}\). The results of the scans presented indicate that ATLAS can discover signals of R-parity conserving SUSY with squark and gluino masses less than 600-700 GeV in many scenarios. There are MSSM scenarios where ATLAS does not discover the signal even though the mass scale is as low as 450 GeV. Signals of Universal Extra Dimensions can be discovered if \(1/R<700\) GeV.
