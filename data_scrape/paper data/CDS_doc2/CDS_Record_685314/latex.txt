Introduction

The ATLAS muon alignment system has the purpose to limit the sagitta error due to chamber misalignment to less than 30 \(\mu\)m [1]. In the barrel region this task will be solved by arranging the chambers in projective towers and aligning them inside each tower with projective straightness monitors [2],[3].

The ATLAS forward muon spectrometer has features which prevent the use of the same alignment scheme:

* Each endcap spectrometer consists of a large number of chambers (more than 250) segmented in 16 overlaping sectors. Consequently, the number of projective towers and the number of required projective alignment rays would be very large.
* The end-cap toroid (ECT) cryostats do not allow a large number of projective holes for alignment rays.

This are the reasons why an alternative alignment strategy has been chosen for the forward region. It is based on the use of a system of reference bars to which the chambers are optically connected [2],[4]. The bars are aligned w.r.t. each other by optical multi-point straightness monitors which allow to determine the relative bar positions over the whole end-cap and transition region forming a closed reference grid. The chamber positions are reconstructed with respect to this reference frame.

In this note, the principle constituent parts and the detailed layout of the forward alignment system are described. The results of the Monte-Carlo analysis of the performance, stability, redundancy and calibration of the alignment system are presented. The requirements for the forward alignment system parameters are evaluated.

## 2 Principles of the Alignment Scheme

The basic elements of the forward alignment scheme are the following:

* Reference bars, made of mechanically and thermally stable material (carbon fibres), which form the skeleton of the alignment system.
* Optical straightness monitors which align bars w.r.t. each other and connect each forward MDT chamber with the reference grid. Two main types of optical devices will be used for these purposes: three-point (CCD-RASNIK [?]) and multi-point straightness monitors with transparent 2-dimensional MPA position sensors [5, 6])

Combination of these elements allows to align each projective chamber tower with the accuracy required for high-\(p_{t}\) muon momentum reconstruction, and to measure relative positions of chambers in different polar sectors with the accuracy needed for adequate di-muon mass resolution of the ATLAS muon spectrometer. The reconstructed relative positions of the chambers are strongly correlated due to the use of polar straightness monitors with directions (pseudo-)projective to the interaction point. Thus giving very high sagitta correction accuracy, these monitors measure the geometrical parameters of the forward muon system in the most effective way for the correction of the systematic sagitta error caused by chambers misalignment.

The whole alignment system is constructed from four subsystems:

* One subsystem consists of radial reference bars in each of the endcap chamber layers is connected by polar monitors in (z,\(\theta\)) planes (see Fig. 1), which measure relative positions of the bars.
* The second system, using azimuthal monitors between bars in a given chamber layer, controls the relative positions of bars within the chamber (r,\(\phi\)) planes (see Fig. 1).
* To provide access to the ATLAS inner tracker and calorimeters, the endcap toroid cryostats have to be removable. This makes it unavoidable to split the reference bars in the inner (EI,FI), middle (EM, FM) and outer chamber (EO, FO) layers. The purpose of the third alignment subsystem is to control relative displacements of the two parts of each split bar. This system, together with the previous two, forms a closed reference grid for the whole forward region.
* The fourth subsystem connects chamber to the adjacent alignment bars (see Fig. 1).

In the following the constituent parts of the alignment system are discussed in detail.

### System of Alignment Bars and Polar Monitors

In Fig.2 the following principal set-up of the reference bar system of the forward alignment system is shown: four alignment bars, placed radially along the inner (I), transition (E), middle (M) and outer (O) chamber layers, are connected with three multi-point polar monitors with sensors installed in pairs on the bars. This bar set-up repeats itself eight-fold following the azimuthal symmetry of the EC chamber layout.

The polar monitor (1) (at the highest \(\eta\)-value) connects the inner, middle and outer bars; it therefore has six MPA sensors. This six-point monitor passes through dedicated tubes in the ECT cryostat.

Monitor (2) is an eight-point straightness monitor connecting all 4 bars. It passes just above the outer envelope of the ECT cryostat.

The six-point polar monitor (3) connects the inner, transition and middle bars.

All three polar monitors are (pseudo-)projective. the role of the projectivity of the polar monitors is discussed below.

The whole system of four bars (I, T, M, O) with three polar monitors can be subdivided into two analogous subsystems:

(a) The system of the bars (I, M, O) with the monitors (1) and (2), and

(b) The system of the bars (I, T, M) with the monitors (2) and (3).

The principal subsystem of three reference bars connected by two six-point monitors is shown in Fig. 6.

Analytical analysis shows (see [4]), that if the directions of the two monitors are not parallel, the information provided by them is sufficient for the full reconstruction of the relative positions of the bars.

The accuracy of the reconstruction depends on:

* The MPA sensor proper resolution \(\sigma^{MPA}_{x,y}\).
* The relative positioning accuracy of polar sensors on the bars, \(\sigma^{pol}_{x,y,z}\).
* The dispersion of the laser beam deflection by the sensors, \(\sigma^{MPA}_{\alpha}\) (see [5, 6]).
* The distance \(L_{pol}\) between the polar sensors on the alignment bars.

To understand the role of the projective straightness monitors for the sagitta correction procedure, consider a simplified one-dimensional model of chamber misalignment. It is assumed here that the chambers are coupled to the alignment bars with infinite accuracy. In this model, relative chamber positions are characterized by only one parameter, the relative displacement \(D_{y}\) in the bend-direction, see Fig. 7.

The performance of straightness monitor is limited by the relative positioning accuracy of the alignment devices \(\sigma^{pol}_{y}\) which in practice is worse than the proper resolution of the sensors.

To reconstruct the relative positions of the inner and outer chambers w.r.t. the middle one, it is necessary to know the direction \(\alpha\) of the light beam which is measured by the pair of sensors on the middle bar.

The angular resolution \(\sigma_{\alpha}\) depends on the distance \(L_{pol}\) between the two sensors on the bar and on the value of \(\sigma^{pol}_{y}\):

\[\sigma_{\alpha}\sim\frac{\sigma^{pol}_{y}}{L_{pol}}. \tag{1}\]

The errors on the displacement parameters \(D^{I}_{y},D^{O}_{y}\) are proportional to the distances between the chambers, \(\delta Z_{IM},\delta Z_{MO}\), and to \(\sigma_{\alpha}\):

\[\sigma(D^{I}_{y})\sim\sigma_{\alpha}\cdot\delta Z_{IM}\sim\frac{\delta Z_{IM} }{L_{pol}}\cdot\sigma^{pol}_{y}\gg\sigma^{pol}_{y}, \tag{2}\]\[\sigma(D_{y}^{O})\sim\sigma_{\alpha}\cdot\delta Z_{MO}\sim\frac{\delta Z_{MO}}{L_{ \mathit{pol}}}\cdot\sigma_{y}^{\mathit{pol}}\gg\sigma_{y}^{\mathit{pol}}. \tag{3}\]

The errors on the parameters \(D_{y}^{I}\) and \(D_{y}^{O}\) are strongly correlated because the same light beam is used for both measurements. It can be easily seen from Fig. 7, that if the error on \(D_{y}^{O}\) is positive, the error on \(D_{y}^{I}\) is negative and vice versa. This implies for the false sagitta measurement of a muon due to misalignment,

\[FS=\frac{\delta Z_{MO}}{\delta Z_{IO}}\cdot D_{y}^{I}+\frac{\delta Z_{IM}}{ \delta Z_{IO}}\cdot D_{y}^{O}, \tag{4}\]

that these errors almost cancell each other. Therefore the sagitta is measured with much better accuracy than \(D_{y}^{I}\) and \(D_{y}^{O}\). The accuracy is independent of the distance between sensors and approximately equal to the sensor positioning accuracy:

\[\sigma_{FS}\approx\sigma_{y}^{\mathit{pol}}. \tag{5}\]

Monte-Carlo simulations of the realistic three-dimensional model (see Section 4) confirm these simple estimations.

The use of multi-points (pseudo-)projective monitors therefore allows to solve the two-fold problem of a high precision alignment system for a large detector:

* To measure the false sagitta caused by the chamber misalignment with high accuracy.
* To reconstruct relative chamber positions with sufficient accuracy to make the alignment system stable to bar and chamber displacements over a wide range.

The described bar systems connected by polar monitors repeat themselves in several (z,\(\theta\)) planes following the azimuthal symmetry of the chamber layout. An eight-fold repetition is necessary in order to be able to connect all chambers azimuthally to the nearest bars in the chamber plane with optical multi-point monitors.

### Azimuthal Bar-Bar Monitors

To reconstruct relative positions of bar systems (Fig. 1) in adjacent (z,\(\theta\)) planes, it is sufficient to connect the bars in one chamber layer with two azimuthally oriented 4-point monitors. As for the polar monitors, the sensors of the azimuthal bar-bar monitors are pairs installed in each bar. The directions of the two monitors have to be slightly non-parallel. If the bars in the other chamber layers are connected in the same way, the redundancy and hence the robustness of the alignment system is increased.

With these azimuthal connections of all adjacent \((z,\theta)\) systems, the whole reference grid of each forward region forms a closed system where all elements (individual bars) are aligned w.r.t. each other.

The performance of the azimuthal system of bar-bar monitors is characterized by:

* The sensor proper resolution \(\sigma^{MPA}_{x,y}\).
* The accuracy of relative azimuthal sensor positioning on the bars, \(\sigma^{zz}_{x,y,z}\).
* The laser beam deflection \(\sigma^{MPA}_{\alpha}\).
* The distance \(L_{az}\) between the azimuthal sensors on the alignment bars.
* The angle \(\theta_{az}\) between two azimuthal monitor directions between adjacent bars in one chamber layer.

### Monitors Connecting Split Bars

The optical system which control the relative positions of the two parts of split bars in the inner and middle layers is described in section??. It consists of a four-point straightness monitor along the radial bar axis, and of a proximity monitor (RASNIK system). The first monitor controls the straightness of the split bar, and the second one measures the distance between the the two bar components. The relevant parameters determining the accuracy are:

* The proper resolutions of the MPA sensors, \(\sigma^{MPA}_{x,y}\), and of the proximity monitor \(\sigma^{prox}_{x,y,z}\),
* The dispersion of the laser beam deflection \(\sigma^{MPA}_{\alpha}\).
* The positioning accuracy of radial sensors, \(\sigma^{rad}_{x,y,z}\), and proximity monitor elements \(\sigma^{propos}_{x,y,z}\).

### Azimuthal Bar-Chamber and Chamber-Chamber Planarity Monitors

The role of the previous three alignment subsystems is to form a reference skeleton of the alignment system: the grid of bars. The final goal, of course, is to reconstruct the relative positions of the chambers. The next step therefore is the monitoring of the chamber positions w.r.t. the alignment bars.

The principal chamber-to-bar connection (compare [4]) consists of two pairs of azimuthal, asymmetric RASNIK monitors, oriented parallel to the wires, linking each chamber to the nearest bars in the chamber layer at the two opposite ends of the chamber (see Fig. 8). For each three point RASNIK monitor, one element is mounted on the bar while the other two are installed on the MDT cross-plates on opposite ends of the chamber.

To save space and to decrease the number of monitors, the azimuthal bar-bar monitor could be combined with bar-chamber monitors. In this case, two additional MPA sensors are mounted on the chamber in the laser beam of the azimuthal bar-bar monitor (see Fig. 9), which replace a pair of azimuthal chamber-bar RASNIK monitors.

In the actual Endcap chamber layout there are (in general) two chamber sectors, a large and a small one, between two adjacent alignment bars in the \((\mathrm{r},\phi)\) plane (see Fig. 10). This alignment and bar system layout has been chosen in order to minimize the number of polar monitors and corresponding tubes through the ECT cryostat.

In this case, in deviation from the above, each chamber is connected with two azimuthal asymmetric RASNIK monitors to the nearest alignment bar, oriented parallel to the wires. The RASNIK light sources and lenses are mounted on the chamber cross-plates or near the cross-plates on the tubes (see Fig. 11), and the CCD's are placed on the alignment bars. This system controls all parameters of the chamber position w.r.t. the bar system except for the rotation angle of the chamber around the bar axis. The relative positions of the two bars on the opposite sides of the two chambers are measured with the bar-bar monitors. Therefore, to completely reconstruct the positions of the two chambers w.r.t. the bars, it is sufficient to supplement the system of four azimuthal RASNIK monitors with a monitor controlling the planarity of the two chamber planes (see Fig. 11). Again, the azimuthal bar-bar monitor and the bar-chamber and chamber-chamber planarity monitors can be combined (see Fig. 12).

Top view of an endcap MDT layer illustrating the arrangment of the azimuthal bar-bar, bar-chamber and chamber-chamber monitors is shown in Fig. 3.

The accuracy of the reconstruction of the chamber positions relative to the bar grid depends on:

* The RASNIK monitor proper resolutions \(\sigma^{R}_{x,y},\sigma^{R}_{m\,agn}\) (image magnification).
* The accuracy of the azimuthal sensor positioning on the chambers, \(\sigma^{c\hbar}_{x,y,z}\).

## 3 Results of Monte-Carlo Simulations

A Monte-Carlo program was used for the study of the proposed alignment scheme. This program simulates the geometry of the ATLAS muon system and accounts for the following factors affecting the performance of the alignment scheme:

* Displacements and rotations of chambers w.r.t. their ideal positions: \(D^{c\hbar}_{x,y,z}\), \(R^{c\hbar}_{x,y,z}\).

* Displacements and rotations of alignment bars w.r.t. their ideal positions: \(D^{\mathit{bar}}_{x,y,z}\), \(R^{\mathit{bar}}_{x,y,z}\).
* Chamber position resolution in the non-bend coordinate: \(\sigma^{\mathit{eh}}_{n\bar{0}}\).
* Longitudinal spread \(\sigma^{\mathit{IP}}_{z}\) of the interaction region which leads to non-projectivity of high-momentum particles.
* MPA sensor proper resolutions \(\sigma^{MPA}_{x,y}\).
* Dispersion \(\sigma^{MPA}_{\alpha}\) of the laser beam deflection by MPA sensors.
* RASNIK proper resolutions \(\sigma^{R}_{x,y},\sigma^{R}_{m\,\mathit{ag}}\);
* Accuracy of sensor positioning on the alignment bars for polar sensors, \((\sigma^{\mathit{pol}}_{x,y,z})\), azimuthal sensors, \((\sigma^{\mathit{az}}_{x,y,z})\), radial sensors, \((\sigma^{\mathit{rad}}_{x,y,z})\), and proximity monitors, \((\sigma^{\mathit{prx}}_{x,y,z})\).
* Accuracy of azimuthal sensor positioning on the chambers: \(\sigma^{\mathit{eh}}_{x,y,z}\).
* Distances \(L_{\mathit{pol}}\) and \(L_{\mathit{az}}\) between polar and azimuthal sensors, respectively, on the alignment bars.
* The angle \(\theta_{\mathit{az}}\) between two azimuthal bar-bar monitor directions.

The relevant parameter characterising the performance of the alignment procedure is the root-mean-square \(RMS_{\mathit{cs}}\) of the corrected sagitta distribution.

The following general conclusions can be made from the detailed MC study of the dependence of \(RMS_{\mathit{cs}}\) on the above parameters:

* There is virtually no dependence on the values of the chamber and bar displacements and rotations \(D^{\mathit{eh}}_{x,y,z}\), \(R^{\mathit{eh}}_{x,y,z}\), \(D^{\mathit{bar}}_{x,y,z}\), \(R^{\mathit{bar}}_{x,y,z}\), and on the values of the non-bend coordinate resolution \(\sigma^{\mathit{eh}}_{n\bar{0}}\) and the interaction region spread \(\sigma^{\mathit{IP}}_{z}\). These parameters define the external conditions for the alignment procedure. The MC simulations show that the alignment corrections are stable w.r.t. these effects. The quantitative results on the stability of the alignment system are presented in Section 4.2.
* The remaining factors are intrinsic to the alignment system. The MC simulations show that their contributions to the value of \(RMS_{\mathit{cs}}\) are statistically independent. Therefore, it is possible to parametrize the dependence of \(RMS_{\mathit{cs}}\) on these parameters. The coefficients of this parametrization, and the resulting requirements for the implementation of the alignment system are described in Section 4.1.
* The forward alignment system has a large built-in redundancy. This important feature is the subject of Section 4.3.

### Performance of the Alignment System

For the performance studies the following values were assumed for the range of chamber and bar displacements and rotations, for the chamber non-bend resolution, and for the interaction point spread:

\[D_{x,y,z}^{\mbox{\tiny$\mbox{$\mbox{$\mbox{$\mbox{$\mbox{$\mbox{$ \mbox{$\mbox{$\mbox{$\mbox{$\mbox{$\mbox{$\mbox{$}$}$}$}}}}}}}$}}},\,D_{x,y,z}^{ \mbox{\tiny$\mbox{$\mbox{$\mbox{$\mbox{$\mbox{$\mbox{$\mbox{$\mbox{$ \mbox{$\mbox{$\mbox{$\mbox{$\mbox{$\mbox{$\mbox{$\smallsmall$}$}$}$}}}}}}}$}}} }\leq 2\ cm, \tag{6}\]

\[R_{x,y,z}^{\mbox{\tiny$\mbox{$\mbox{$\mbox{$\mbox{$\mbox{$\mbox{$\mbox{$ \mbox{$\mbox{$\mbox{$\mbox{$\mbox{$\mbox{$\mbox{$\mbox{$}}$}$}}}}}}}}}$}},\,R_{x,y,z}^{ \mbox{\tiny$\mbox{$\mbox{$\mbox{$\mbox{$\mbox{$\mbox{$\mbox{$\mbox{$ \mbox{$\mbox{$\mbox{$\mbox{$\mbox{$\mbox{$\mbox{$\mbox{$\mbox{$\mbox{$}}$}}}}}}}}}}}}}} }\leq 3\ m\,\mbox{$\mbox{$\mbox{$\mbox{$\mbox{$\mbox{$\mbox{$\mbox{$ \mbox{\mbox{$\mbox{$\mbox{$\mbox{$\mbox{$\mbox{${\smallsmall$}}$}$}}}}}}}}}$}} }, \tag{7}\]

\[\sigma_{n\,\mbox{\tiny$\mbox{$\mbox{$\mbox{$\mbox{$\mbox{$\mbox{$ \mbox{$\mbox{$\mbox{$\mbox{$\mbox{$\mbox{$\mbox{$\mbox{$\mbox{$ \mbox{$\mbox{$\mbox{$\mbox{$}}}}}}}}}}}}}}$}}$}}^{\mbox{\mbox{\tiny$ \mbox{$\mbox{$\mbox{$\mbox{$\mbox{$\mbox{$\mbox{$\mbox{$\mbox{$ \mbox{$\mbox{$\mbox{$\mbox{$\mbox{$\mbox{$\mbox{$\mbox{$\mbox{$\mbox{$ \mbox{$}}}}}}}}}}}}}}$}}}$}}}=1\ cm, \tag{8}\]

\[\sigma_{z}^{IP}=5\ cm. \tag{9}\]

The dependence of \(RMS_{\mbox{\tiny$\mbox{$\mbox{$\mbox{$\mbox{$\mbox{$\mbox{$\mbox{$\mbox{$ \mbox{$\mbox{$\mbox{$\mbox{$\mbox{$\mbox{$\mbox{$\mbox{$\mbox{$ \mbox{$\mbox{$\mbox{$}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}$}}$}}\) on these parameters will be discussed in the next section.

The number of intrinsic parameters of the alignment system affecting the performance is rather large. Fortunately their contributions to \(RMS_{\mbox{\tiny$\mbox{$\mbox{$\mbox{$\mbox{$\mbox{$\mbox{$\mbox{$ \mbox{$\mbox{$\mbox{$\mbox{$\mbox{$\mbox{$\mbox{$\mbox{${\mbox{$ \mbox{$\mbox{$}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}$}}$}}\) factorize; the dependence of \(RMS_{\mbox{\tiny$\mbox{$\mbox{$\mbox{$\mbox{$\mbox{$\mbox{$\mbox{$ \mbox{\mbox{$\mbox{$\mbox{$\mbox{$\mbox{${\mbox{$\mbox{${\mbox{$ \mbox{$\mbox{$}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}$}}$}}\) on the intrinsic parameters has a simple parametric form. Analysis of this parametrization allows to identify the most critical parameters and to formulate the requirements for the implementation of the alignment system.

The result of the parametrization based on the MC data has the following form:

\[RMS_{\mbox{\tiny$\mbox{$\mbox{$\mbox{$\mbox{$\mbox{$\mbox{$ \mbox{$\mbox{$\mbox{$The performance of the alignment system is essentially determined by the accuracy of the positioning of the optical devices on bars and chambers, since it is unrealistic to expect that this accuracy can be in the same few microns range as are the monitor proper resolutions.

As can be seen from Table 1, the value of \(RMS_{cs}\) is most sensitive to the placement accuracy of the sensors in the bend direction (y). Therefore the most strict requirements have to be imposed on the mounting accuracy of the monitors in this direction.

On the other hand the performance of the alignment system is almost independent of the positioning accuracy of sensors along the wires (x direction). MDT chambers do not have precise fiducial points for mounting of the alignment devices in this coordinate. The forward alignment system was designed to avoid strict requirements for the monitor positioning along the wire direction. The MC simulations verify this.

The analysis of the MC results summarized in Table 1 allows to define requirements for the implementation of the alignment system.

The specifications, shown in Table 2, appear technically feasible and allow to satisfy the goal of \(RMS_{cs}\leq\) 30 \(\mu m\) for performance of the alignment system.

### Redundancy

The redundancy of the alignment system is defined by the excess of the number of monitor readings over the minimum number required for the reconstruction of the relative chamber positions.

All bars and chambers of the whole forward region are aligned w.r.t. each other. The closed interconnection of the alignment system for the full forward region is an important feature for the redundancy and reliability of the system. As mentioned in Section 2.2, the redundancy of the system can be significantly increased by connecting bars azimuthally in more than one chamber layer.

The values of \(RMS_{cs}\) for the different variants of monitor losses in one sector are shown in Table 3.

The MC study shows that the alignment system is still alive for significant (up to 30%) losses of monitors. Degraded performance can be improved by calibration with tracks of the optical monitor positioning.

## 4 Calibration of the Forward Alignment System

The possibility of improving the performance of the alignment system by calibration with tracking data has been studied.

The details of possible calibration method are discussed in [11]. Here the main features are presented.

A procedure similar to the straight-track calibration method of the barrel alignment system can also be applied in the forward region.

For projective tracks, the systematic deviation of the measured sagitta of atrack ("false sagitta" FS) due to chamber misalignment is a function of the polar (\(\theta\)) and azimuthal (\(\phi\)) angles of the tracks. If the range of chamber misalignment is small in comparison to the distances between chambers, this false sagitta function \(FS(\phi,\theta)\) assumes a simple polynomial form,

\[FS(\phi,\theta)\thickapprox a_{00}+a_{10}\ast tg(\phi)+a_{01}\ast tg(\theta)+a_ {11}\ast tg(\phi)\ast tg(\theta)+a_{0\,2}\ast tg^{2}(\theta), \tag{17}\]

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|c|} \hline  & 0 polar sensor lost & 1 polar sensor lost & 2 polar sensor lost \\ \hline
0 azimuthal sensor lost & 27 & 32 & 68 \\
1 azimuthal sensor lost & 29 & 33 & 69 \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 3: \(RMS_{cs}\) [\(\mu m\)] for losses of polar and/or azimuthal sensorswhere the coefficients \(a_{ij}\) depend on the relative chamber displacement parameters.

The muon detector measures the apparent sagitta of straight tracks due to chamber misalignment and multiple scattering in the middle chambers. The optical alignment system predicts the false sagitta for the tracks as a result, again, of the chambers misalignment and of the monitor mispositioning.

Comparison of these values on a statistical basis for \(N_{st}\) straight tracks allows to extract the correction function \(C\,or\,(\phi,\theta)\) which is determined by the sensor mispositioning only:

\[C\,or\,(\phi,\theta)\approx c_{00}+c_{10}*tg(\phi)+c_{01}*tg(\theta)+c_{11}*tg (\phi)*tg(\theta)+c_{02}*tg^{2}(\theta). \tag{18}\]

This correction function can then be applied for curved tracks to correct for sensor mispositioning.

The MonteCarlo simulations show that the statistics of 2000 particles with transverse momentum \(P_{t}\geq 20\)\(GeV/c\) provide the performance of the alignment system \(RMS_{cs}\leq 30\)\(\mu m\) even if the mounting precisions \(\sigma_{y}^{bar,ch}\) as bad as 100\(\mu m\).

The performance of this calibration method is limited by the second order effects not accounting for by the polinomial (17). It prevents an improvement of the resolution by simple increasing of the amount of statistics.

## 5 Implementation of the Endcap Alignment System

In this section, the detailed geometrical layout of the endcap alignment system is described.

The topology of the alignment grid is determined by the layout of the endcap muon precision chamber system which is segmented into 16 azimuthal sectors, 8 large and 8 small ones.

Proceeding from this layout of the endcap chambers, a reference grid with eight-fold repetition in (r, \(\phi\)) of the polar alignment bar and monitor systems was chosen (see Fig. 13). The alignment bars are located along the sides of the large chambers on the surfaces of the small chambers.

### Layout of the Polar Monitor System

Each system of bars in a (z,\(\theta\)) plane is interconnected by three polar multi-point monitors (see Section??). As baseline, these three polar monitors have a common intersection point in the ATLAS interaction point. Consequently they are projective and characterized by one parameter, the pseudo-rapidity \(\eta\) as given in Table 4.

Further optimisation of the layout and potential conflicts of the polar light paths with the endcap toroid (ECT) cryostat may require to give up exact projectivity of all or part of the polar monitors. The performance of the endcap alignment system is insensitive to to rather large deviations from projectivity.

The polar monitors (1) and (2) transverse the planes of the middle MDT and TGC chambers. The segmentation of these chambers allows to provide the required lines of sight at the edges of the chambers, minimizing cutouts in the chambers (see Figs. 11 and 12). In the inner and outer layers, the bars are mounted on the sides w.r.t. the interaction point which point to the middle layer. In this way no cutouts for polar monitors in the inner and outer chambers are needed. Monitor (3) passes outside the outer chamber radius and therefore does not require any cutouts in the endcap chambers.

Polar monitor (1) passes through a thermally shielded projective tube in the ECT cryostat. Polar monitors (2) and (3) pass outside the ECT cryostat. Therefore eight projective tubes are required through the ECT cryostat (see Fig. 15).

### Layout of the Azimuthal Monitor Systems

The small and large endcap MDT sectors are arranged such that the chambers overlap with both tube multilayers. The azimuthal monitors connecting the chambers to the alignment bars pass in the 30 mm wide gap in z between small and large chambers (see Fig. 3, Fig. 13 and Fig. 16). Lenses and masks of the azimuthal RASNIK monitors are mounted on top of the tube multilayers of small and large chambers while the CCDs are installed on the alignment bars.

The planarity RASNIK monitors between adjacent small and large chambers will also be installed on the tube multilayers and pass in the gap between the connected chambers (see Fig. 3, Fig. 13 and Fig. 16).

The locations of the RASNIK elements on the chambers are determined by requirements of the general layout of the endcap chambers, the feasibility of the installation of sensor mounts during chamber assembly, and by considerations of mechanical and thermal stability of the of the precision mounts of the optical elements on the chambers.

As discussed in Section 2.2, the minimum required azimuthal bar-bar connection is in one out of four layers. Fig. 13 shows the layout of the azimuthal bar-bar monitors in the EM layer which has the highest priority.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|} \hline Monitor & \(\eta\) & MPA sensors & Connected bars & Tube & Azimuth & Polar \\ \hline
1 & 2.07 & 6 & I, M, O & Yes & 17 & 14 \\
2 & 1.39 & 8 & I, T, M, O & No & 17 & 28 \\
3 & 0.98 & 6 & I, T, M & No & 17 & 41 \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 4: Characteristics of polar MPA monitorsFor the sake of robustness and redundancy of the alignment system, it is desirable to connect the bars in more than one layer. For the installation of azimuthal bar-bar monitors in additional layers, a staging scenario is foreseen. Precision sensor mounting plates will be installed on all alignment bars to allow for optional later installation of additional azimuthal bar-bar monitors. The final decision will be made on the basis of a cost vs. performance optimisation and depending on the experience obtained during the initial operation of the forward alignment system. The numbers of components required for the endcap alignment system are summarized in Table 3.

### Protection of the Alignment Rays

Deflections of the polar and azimuthal laser beams by the transparent sensors themselves but also due to density fluctuations in the air between the sensors due to thermal gradients affect the performance of the alignment system. In order to avoid disturbance and deflection of the laser beams by fluctuations in the air, the laser beams will be enclosed in tubes of about 50 mm diameter which are connected via flexible flanges to the sensor housings forming a closed and thermally stable system. At the same time, the sensors are protected against external light sources as well as against dust accumulation and the light rays are secured against blocking. Similar guideing tubes are also desirable for the azimuthal RASNIK monitors.

For the passage of the polar laser rays through the tubes through the ECT cryostat special shielding and temperature control will be used to minimize thermal gradients inside the tubes and near the ECT cryostat.

### Design of the Alignment Bars

The alignment bars carry the following types of optical monitors: MPA-ALMY sensor pairs on a common mounting plate for polar monitors and azimuthal bar-bar monitors, the CCDs of the azimuthal bar-chamber RASNIK straightness monitors, and monitors connecting the components of the split bars. A typical alignment bar (in the EM layer) is shown in Fig. 17 with MPA-ALMY sensors and RASNIK elements installed (Figs. 18 and 3). The bar provides a mechanical connection between the optical elements of the polar and azimuthal monitors which has to be stable over time with high accuracy.

In order to allow for removal of the ECT and access to the calorimeters and inner detector, the alignment bars in the EI and EM layers are split at the outer radius of the ECT castellations (see Figs. 3 and 14). The two components of a split bar are connected by a high-precision optical monitoring system which consists of a six-point straightness monitor along the axis of the bar, with three transparent MPA-ALMY sensors on each bar component, and a RASNIK proximity monitor.

The straightness monitor controls the parallel alignment of the two bar components and at the same time, with the help of the third sensor on each bar segment, measures the sag of the bars. Torsions of the bars turn out to be uncritical for the precision of the endcap alignment system. The proximity monitor mainly measures the distance between the bar components with high precision and rotations around the axis of the straightness monitor.

The separation in z of the alignment bars for the EO and FO layers does not allow to use the same scheme for split-bar connection as for the other layers. In the outer layer, the two bar components therefore are optically connected by a MPA-ALMY 4-point monitor with a sensor pair mounted on the EO and the FO bar (see Figs. 13 and 14) and with an asymmetric RASNIK monitor.

The length of the different bar segments varies between 1900 mm and 6300 mm. The bar segments will be kinematically supported at their ends from the endcap chamber support structures.

### Fabrication of Alignment Bars

The alignment bars are precision elements like the MDT chambers. All optical elements have to be mounted on the bars with an accuracy in their relative position in x, y and z of 20\(\mu\)m rms. This has been assumed for the simulations of the alignemnt system. The bars themselves do not need precision surfaces. Sensor mounting plates will be glued in place with precision on a granite table with precise reference surface.

The mounting plates have reference marks and dowel pins which allow the later installation of the sensors with high accuracy. A mounting plate carrying a pair of MPA-ALMY sensors (see Fig. 7-25) is shown in Fig. 16. For the relative position of the sensors on the common mounting plate, higher accuracy can be achieved than globally specified for the whole bar. This improvement has not been included into the simulations yet.

It is possible and foreseen to improve the knowledge of the relative sensor positions beyond the accuracy of the precision glueing table by measurement of the positions on a coordinate measuring machine. The most critical parameter is the distance between the optical elements along the axis of the bar. Distances along the length of an alignment bars can be measured with a laser interferometer.

It is essential, that the sensor positions on the bars, determined by the precision assembly table and measurements, are stable with high accuracy during the operation of the experiment. Gravitational sag is the only important bar deformation which has to be controlled precisely; it will be measured using the longitudinal six-point straightness monitors on the bars.

Most critical for the performance of the alignment system are variations in the lengths of the bars due to thermal expansion. The a priori best solution is to use a bar material with very small thermal expansion coefficient. With carbon fiber composites, thermal expansion coefficients below \(0.3\cdot 10^{-6}\) K\({}^{-1}\) can be achievedwith proper orientation of the fibers. Carbon fiber (CF) tubes with a profile of 80 mm x 80 mm and 3 mm wall thickness can be used as typical alignment bars. With a stiffness of 90000 N/mm, the gravitational sag of a 4 m long CF tube is only 0.13 mm which will be controlled with the on-bar optical monitoring system. Several 6 m long CF tubes of the above type have been fabricated for tests and will be used in the test setup for the EC alignment system at Saclay DATCHA. If carbon fiber composite material is used for the bars, another concern is the influence of humidity variations in the experimental hall on the dimensional stability, especially the length of the CF tubes. Simulations [7-25] of the effect of humidity variations between 0 and 50 on CF tubes of 4 m length indicate length variations on the order of 100 \(\mu\)m which follow the humidity changes with a time delay. The amount of water absorption and the resulting length variations depend on the material of the epoxy-type matrix of the CF composite, on the orientation of the fibers and on possible protection by painting the bars. The calculations have to be confronted with measurements on the exact CF material to be used for the alignment bars before decisions can be made.

In case that no CF material can be found which is sufficiently stable with respect to humidity variations, an alternative solution would be to use steal tubes as alignment bars and to monitor the bar temperature precisely in order to correct for thermal expansion assuming a rather uniform and stable temperature in the hall.

### Installation of Optical Monitors on the Endcap Chambers

The typical positions of the optical elements of the azimuthal bar-chamber monitors, mask and lens of the RASNIK monitors, for instance, on two adjacent chambers of the EM layer are shown in Fig. 2.

The RASNIK components will be installed on precision mounting plates which are glued on the tube multilayers during chamber assembly. The optical elements can then be put in place during and after chamber installation in the experiment. Several methods can be used for the precise positioning of sensor mounting plates on the tube multilayers. The specification for the positioning accuracy with respect to the wires is 20 \(\mu\)m, as in the barrel. This was the assumption for the simulation of the performance of the EC alignment system. The tube outer diameters near the cross plates provide one precise reference for sensor positioning relative to the wires; such a method has been described in [7].

A second method has already been successfully tested during the construction of the first full-scale BMS MDT prototype chamber [8]. In this case, a large number of sensor mounting plates has been placed on the tube multilayers with high accuracy with respect to an external reference, the precise edge and surface of the granite table used for chamber assembly relative to which the tube multilayers also were aligned. Precise templates were used to define the position of the mounting plates in z and y relative to the granite table references. With this method, sensor mounting plates can be positioned almost anywhere on the chamber surface. It is of course desireable to make the precise extensions from the granite table references as short as possible.

The mounting plates were designed to carry MPA-ALMY sensor modules (see [9], [10]) to be used for measurements of mechanical deformations of the multilayers. At the same time, with the help of MPA-ALMY sensors installed on the multilayer, the accuracy of the relative positioning of the mounting plates was determined to be better than 5 \(\mu\)m rms [8]. This is also the accuracy of the sensor positioning relative to the tube outer diameter near the endplugs.

The thermal stability of the chamber geometry outside the assembly jig and of the sensor positioned on the chambers has yet to be fully studied. This will be an ingredient for the choice of the locations of optical devices on the chambers.
