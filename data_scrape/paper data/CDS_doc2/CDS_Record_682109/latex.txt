The barrel e.m. presampler will be composed of 5l 2 modules arranged in rows or azimuthal sectors. There are 8 different modules in each azimuthal sector.

The modules are built up by alterning multi-layered anode and cathode electrodes defining the electrical field for the charge collection in the liquid argon gap, see figure 1. The module production requires to place and stack the electrodes between accurate shims in a hermetic mould. The edges of the electrodes are glued between FR4 slabs by means of glass cloth pre-impregnated with epoxy. This technique allows to have the electrodes slanted or perpendicular to the FR4 slabs which form the support structure of the module.

In this report, we will analyse the possibility of having the electrodes of some modules not slanted. This will reduce the cost and simplify the module construction.

## 2 Description of the electrodes

The cathodes are double-sided copper clad-glass epoxy circuits. The anodes have 3 copper layers insulated by 2 glass epoxy layers (i.e. pre-impregnated foil). A positive HV of about +2 kV will be applied to the external anode layers, while the shower signal is read out by capacitive coupling to the central anode layer. The overall thicknesses of those electrodes (recently measured) are 240 \(\mu\)m and 335 \(\mu\)m for the cathodes and anodes respectively, (the copper layers are 17 \(\mu\)m thick).

In order to limit the high voltage at 2 kV and to maintain the electric field close to its nominal value (1 kV/mm), the gap between the two kinds of electrodes was chosen to be about 2 mm. Therefore the number of electrodes per detection cell of granularity \(\Delta\eta=0.025\) is not constant.

## 3 Inclination angle of the electrodes

The electrodes can be slanted so that they offer a 100% geometric efficiency to muons (i.e. a muon will pass through at most two cells), see figure 2. In that case, the inclination angle of each electrode depends on its position along the longitudinal axis (i.e. the collider beam axis). A simpler design would be to have all the electrodes perpendicular to the longitudinal axis. But for the very first modules, close to the center of the barrel, the trajectories of the incident particles are practically parallel to the electrodes. The electronic pulse is then strongly dependent on the distance between the particle trajectory and the anode, see section 5. Moreover, for these modules, the current response has not always the expected triangular shape, and the signal duration (corresponding to the drift time of the charges produced in the liquid argon) is not constant.

## 4 Monte-Carlo simulation

In order to estimate the signal distortion when having the electrodes not slanted, a simulation has been done, taking into account secondary particles (\(\delta\)-rays et c..) and using very low cuts (10 KeV) and very short step (\(\sim\)10 \(\mu\)m) in the active part of the presampler. In order to correctly reproduce the early development of showers, the liquid argon clearance, the warm and cold walls of the cryostat and the superconducting coil which are situated upstream of the presampler, have been taken into account1, see table 1.

Footnote 1: This work has been done before the full cold wall choice for the cryostat

In this program, the total thicknesses of the cathodes and anodes were 250 \(\mu\)m and 350 \(\mu\)m respectively, (copper layers were also introduced).

The vertex distribution (collision points where the incident particles are emitted from) was chosen to be a gaussian along the beam axis with a standard deviation of 6 cm. The shape of the signal read out by the anodes was determined with the following relation :

\[pulse(t)=\sum_{i=1}^{hits}\left(q_{e}-\frac{\Delta E_{i}}{W_{0}}\right)\frac{v_ {\varphi:fit}}{gap}\;\theta\left(\frac{d_{i}}{v_{\theta:fit}}-t\right)\]

where : \(\theta(t)\) is the Heaviside's function, \(q_{e}\)- the electron charge, \(\Delta E_{i}\) the energy deposited by the primary or the secondary particles in track step i, \(d_{i}\) the distance of the track position in step i to the anode, \(W_{0}\)=23.1 eV/ion-e- pair in liquid argon.

The calculated pulse can then be compared to the expected triangular shape, thus allowing to define a \(\chi^{2}\) function :

\[\chi^{2}=\sum_{n}\left(pulse(t_{n})-pulse(t=0)\left(1-\frac{t_{n}}{t_{drift}} \right)\right)^{2}\]

where : \(t_{drift}=\frac{g\,ap}{v_{drift}}\)

## 5 Results

Figures 3 and 4 give the energy distribution and the current response for 40 GeV \(\gamma\)'s hitting the middle of the first module (\(\eta\)=0.1). One can already see that for this module, modulations

appear in the response when the electrodes are straight. Then it is necessary to keep the electrodes slanted. Figures 5 and 6 show the \(\chi^{2}\) function defined in the previous section for 20 GeV electrons hitting the middles of the first (\(\eta\)=0.1) and the fourth (\(\eta\)=0.7) modules. Here, one can see that only the very first modules (close to the barrel center) need to have their electrodes slanted. Actually, as the inclination angle for the third module is naturally close to zero (-1.6 degree), only the two first modules really need to have their electrodes slanted.

When the electrodes are perpendicular instead of slanted, the deposited energy sharing between adjacent detection cells increases. To estimate this effect we defined the ratios R\({}_{1}\) and R\({}_{2}\) in the following way : N is the number of events where the incident particle has deposited the maximun energy in the detection cell i. The average energy deposited in this cell will be labelled \(\vec{E}_{i}\). For the adjacent cell (i+1) there will be N' events among the N ones verifying the relation :

\[E_{i+1}>0.1\ \ (or\ \ 0.3)\ \ \vec{E}_{i}\]

and N" events (among the N ones) verifying :

\[E_{i+1}>0.1\ \ (or\ \ 0.3)\ \ E_{i}\]

(In the first case the threshold is fixed, in the latter the energies deposited in cells i and i+1 are compared event by event).

The ratios \(R_{1}=\frac{N^{\prime}}{N}\) and \(R_{2}=\frac{N^{*}}{N}\) measure the deposited energy sharing between the 2 adjacent cells. Table 2 shows that the design with straight electrodes (in modules 3-8) leads to a small effect with a difference of about 2%.

It is also interesting to have a rough idea on the signal/noise ratio when reducing the gap between the electrodes and therefore increasing the number of them. Table 3 gives the average signal response i\({}_{0}\) as a function of the inclination angle and the number of elementary cells per detection cell. For instance, with 20 GeV electrons, module number 7, the average current response increases of 41% when comparing both designs. The noise is then given by the expression [1] :

\[Noise\ _{0T}=\alpha C_{detection\ cell}+\beta\]

where \(C_{detection\ cell}\) represents the detection cell capacitance and the last term \(\beta\) the parallel noise.

In our considered case :

\[C_{detection\ cell}=\frac{15}{8}cos(40^{\circ}).C_{elementary\ cell}\]

This leads to a noise increase of 43%, implying a signal/noise ratio pratically constant.

## 6 conclusion

In order to avoid distorted signal waveforms, the electrodes of the first two modules will be slanted (+18.6 and +8.8 degrees, respectively). The electrodes of the other modules will be

straight. The effect due to the deposited energy sharing between adjacent detection cells is rather small. It is also possible to keep an electric field of 1 kV/mm, and therefore to increase the number of electrodes per detection cell, (this allows to have a gap of 2 mm and therefore a high voltage of 2 kV), without spoiling the ratio signal/noise.
