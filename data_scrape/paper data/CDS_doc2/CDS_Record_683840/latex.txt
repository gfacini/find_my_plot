**Abstract:** The prediction of several MC event generators (Pythia, Phojet, Herwig, and Isajet) for minimum bias events at LHC energies are presented. To test various models the comparison with experimental data has been made (CDF data at \(\surd s=1800\,\mathrm{GeV}\), UA 5 data at \(\surd s=200\,\mathrm{GeV}\) and \(\surd s=900\,\mathrm{GeV}\)). Finally, the models and various parameters settings of MC generators are briefly discussed.

## 1 Introduction

Physics in hadron-hadron interactions can be roughly divided into three categories: elastic, non-diffractive, and diffractive processes (single and double). Elastic events are usually rejected by a trigger and diffractive processes do not much contribute to the overall cross section. Hence, the non-diffractive part is usually identified with _minimum bias_ physics.

Low-\(p_{\perp}\) processes play a dominant role in this non-diffractive part. Perturbative QCD cannot be fully applied to describe them and it is necessary to use some phenomenological models. Various MC event generators contain different minimum bias models. The aim of this work is to compare the models with existing experimental data and to show their predictions for LHC energies.

## 2 MC event generators for minimum bias events

The following four MC event generators have been chosen to study minimum bias events in \(pp\) collisions at LHC energies: Pythia, Phojet, Herwig, and Isajet. This set of generators is wide enough to comprehend various approaches to the problem of description of minimum bias events.

The Pythia model for low-\(p_{\perp}\) non-diffractive physics is described in [1]. It uses the language of perturbative QCD (within the framework of multiple interactions) for both high-\(p_{\perp}\) and low-\(p_{\perp}\) regions. The basic processes are \(2\to 2\) with the usual LO matrix elements. These matrix elements give a divergent total cross section for \(p_{\perp}\to 0\) and two different ways exist how to deal with this problem in Pythia. The first one introduces an abrupt cut \(p_{\perp min}\). The second one smoothly turns off the dangerous terms (like \(1/p_{\perp}^{4}\)) at the limit \(p_{\perp}\to 0\). It multiplies the matrix elements by a factor \(p_{\perp}^{4}/\left(p_{\perp}^{2}+p_{\perp 0}^{2}\right)^{2}\) and it replaces the \(p_{\perp}^{2}\) argument in \(\alpha_{S}\) by \(p_{\perp}^{2}+p_{\perp 0}^{2}\).

There are also two different multiple interaction scenarios in Pythia. The first, more simple, model assumes the same probability in all events. The second one takes into account the distribution of matter in a hadron and the fact that hadrons interact at various impact parameters.

Pythia has been run with several different initial settings. They are listed in Tab. 1. The settings of the subprocesses are not listed there. MSEL=1 has been chosen in the case of LHC energies, and MSEL=2 for TEVATRON and SPS energies. Since the Pythia low-\(p_{\perp}\) models use a perturbative language the model parameters (like \(p_{\perp min}\) or \(p_{\perp 0}\)) are strongly correlated with a chosen parton distribution function. The default values of the parameters correspond to the default distribution function (GRV 94L).

Also two versions of Pythia have been tested: one of the latest versions (Pythia 6.122), and the old version Pythia 5.724 with Jetset 7.410. At least one important change has been made in low-\(p_{\perp}\) physics in Pythia 6.120 and newer versions, see [2]. The regularization parameters \(p_{\perp min}\) and \(p_{\perp 0}\) are now energy dependent.

Contrary to Pythia, Phojet does not attempt to use perturbative QCD for low-\(p_{\perp}\) physics. It is based on the Dual Parton Model (for review see [4]) with a smooth transition between the soft and the hard region at \(p_{\perp}^{cutoff}\). The basic processes for low-\(p_{\perp}\) physics are not perturbative \(2\to 2\) like in Pythia but \(2\to n\). As in the case of Pythia, multiple interactions are also included in Phojet. For further details about Phojet look at [3]. Ralph Engel (the author of Phojet) recommends the newest (preliminary) version Phojet 1.12 for hadron-hadron collisions at TEVATRON and LHC energies [9]. The initial setting of Phojet was similar to Pythia, i.e. only non-diffractive inelastic interactions in the case of LHC energies, and all types of processes (inelastic, diffractive, and elastic) for the TEVATRON and SPS energies.

Pythia and Phojet represent complex models that connect the soft and hard physics. On the other hand, Herwig and Isajet contain more simple minimum bias models that do not have an ambition to give an unified description of soft and hard regions. The Herwig model [5] is based on the UA5 model and the Isajet one [6] on a simplifed version of the Abramovskii-Kanchelli-Gribov model. For the simulations, Herwig 5.9 and Isajet 7.32 have been used with the default setting of their parameters.

From the point of view of extrapolating MC predictions to LHC energies, it is also important whether the latest minimum bias data at \(\surd s=1.8\) TeV have been used to fit the model parameters. Only Phojet has been tuned on that data from the four above-mentioned MC event generators.

## 3 Minimum bias events at SPS, TEVATRON and LHC energies

To test the minimum bias models they were compared with existing experimental data from UA5, see [10], and CDF, see [7, 8]. One-particle inclusive \(p_{\perp}\) spectra are shown in Fig. 1a and

\begin{tabular}{|c|l|l|} \hline
**Label** & **setting** & **comments** \\ \hline
**Mo del1** & MSTP (82)=1 & the simple scenario with an abrupt \(p_{\perp min}\) cut-off \\ \hline
**Mo del4** & MSTP (82)=4 & scenario with varying impact parameter, \\  & & continuous turn-off of cross section at \(p_{\perp 0}\) \\ \hline
**Atlas** & MSTP (82)=4 & \\  & MSTP (2)=2 & NLO formula for \(\alpha_{S}\) in \(2\to 2\) matrix elements \\  & MSTP (33)=3 & inclusion of \(K\) factor in hard \(2\to 2\) cross sections \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}

pseudorapidity distributions of charged particles in Fig. 1b (for CDF data) and in Fig. 2 (for UA5 data).

In these cases the initial settings of Pythia and Phojet were different. All possible processes have been swiched on (MSEL=2 for Pythia) to simulate the real situation at the collider and only the events selected by a minimum bias trigger were accepted.

As have been already discussed in the previous section no unified description of soft and hard regions exists in Herwig and Isajet. One possibility how to merge these two regions, is to mix minimum bias events with high-\(p_{\perp}\) events. The corresponding cut-off parameter \(p_{\perp min}\) of the hard process should be set to the value that gives together with the minimum bias process the right total non-diffractive cross section. This merging was not done in this work, all Herwig and Isajet plots correspond to soft processes only.

Only the MC predictions for basic distributions of charged particles at \(\surd s=14\,\mathrm{TeV}\) are presented in this note: one-particle inclusive \(p_{\perp}\) spectra in the central region (\(y=0\)), pseudorapidity distributions of charged particles \(\mathrm{d}N_{ch}/\mathrm{d}\eta\), and transverse energy flow of charged particles. The corresponding plots for pp collisions at LHC energy are Fig. 3, Fig. 4a, and Fig. 4b.

## 4 Discussion of the results

At SPS energies, almost all MC event generators describe the pseudorapidity distributions of charged particles quite well. Only Pythia 6.122-Model1 and Pythia 6.122-Atlas overestimate the production of charged particles in central rapidity region at \(\sqrt{s}=900\,\mathrm{GeV}\) and the Isajet pseudorapidity distribution is broader than the data at this energy.

Comparison with CDF data [7]. **(b)** Pseudorapidity distributions of charged particles in \(\mathrm{p}\overline{\mathrm{p}}\) collisions at \(\surd s=1.8\,\mathrm{TeV}\).

Pythia 6.122-**Mo dell** and Phojet 1.12p fit the one-particle inclusive \(p_{\perp}\) spectrum from the CDF experiment very well. In the case of the pseudorapidity distribution, Phojet is still fine but Pythia 6.122-**Mo dell** predicts too many charged particles. From this point of view Pythia 6.122-**Mo dell** is better than **Model1**.

The Pythia 6.122-**Atlas** plots are somewhere between **Model1** and **Model4** predictions. Although it uses the same minimum bias scenario (MSTP(82)=4) as **Mo dell**, these two settings of Pythia lead to different results. In the case of **Atlas** setting, \(\alpha_{S}\) is calculated according to the NLO formula and also a \(K\) factor is included in the hard \(2\to 2\) processes. It can play a significant role especially in low-\(p_{\perp}\) region, it changes the hard \(2\to 2\) cross section and consequently the mean number of multiple scatterings per event. I think that this setting of Pythia 6.122 is not an appropriate one. According to the note in [2], the default energy dependence of regularization parameter \(p_{\perp 0}\) is based on MSTP(82)=4, without any change of MSTP(2) or MSTP(33).

In the case of the older version Pythia 5.7, the **Atlas** setting is the appropriate one. Also the Pythia 5.724-**Atlas** plots fit the CDF data much better than Pythia 6.122-**Atlas** ones.

Herwig and Isajet plots fit the \(p_{\perp}\) spectrum from CDF only at very low values of \(p_{\perp}\). This is caused by the lack of hard \(p_{\perp}\) events in the minimum bias models. The pseudorapidity distributions of charged particles agree much better with data.

The differences between the particular MC generators become even more dramatic at LHC energies. The region for expected one-particle inclusive \(p_{\perp}\) spectrum would be probably somewhere between Pythia 6.122-**Model1** and Phojet 1.12p lines. But this two plots differ even by factor \(1.5-2.0\). The same situation holds in the case of pseudorapidity distribution and \(E_{\perp}\) flow: Phojet predicts roughly 5.7 charged particles per unit of pseudorapidity in the central region (\(\eta=0\)), Pythia 6.122-**Model4** 8.5 charged particles, and Pythia 6.122-**Model1** even 11.5 charged particles.

Although Pythia 5.7 fits the CDF data quite well and it is with good agreement with the other Pythia 6.122 plots, a large difference between the two Pythia versions occurs in one-particle \(p_{\perp}\) spectrum at LHC energies. As was discussed earlier, the regularization parameters \(p_{\perp 0}\) and \(p_{\perp min}\) depend on energy in Pythia 6.122 whereas they are energy independent in the older version Pythia 5.7. The next reason, why Pythia 5.7 could not be recommended for studying physics at LHC, is pure technical. The old version is written in single precision (REAL*4) which is not sufficient for LHC energies.

Again, Herwig and Isajet give the smallest values for charged particle pseudorapidity distributions and for \(E_{\perp}\) flow for LHC energies.

## 5 Summary

For further studies of minimum bias events I would recommend the new versions of Pythia (version 6.120 and newer) and the new (preliminary) version 1.12 of Phojet. Default settings of Phojet work (at least at TEVATRON energies) quite well. Concerning Pythia 6.122, the more sophisticated multiple interaction scenario (MSTP(82)=4) is the better choice for an initial setting. This scenario is sensitive to the setting of parameters MSTP(2) and MSTP(33). Current default values of the model MSTP(82)=4 corresponds to the default values of MSTP(2) and MSTP(33) (contrary to Pythia 5.7 where MSTP(2)=2 and MSTP(33)=3 should be used).

Due to the important changes in minimum bias model, Pythia 5.7 could not be recommended for low-\(p_{\perp}\) physics at LHC. Also Herwig 5.9 and Isajet 7.32 are less favourable because of the problems with merging soft and hard processes.

Taking Pythia 6.122-**Mo del4** and Phojet 1.12p as the more reasonable models, the uncertainty at LHC energy \(\surd s=14\,\mathrm{TeV}\) is roughly given by factor 1.5 for of all presented quantities (one-particle inclusive \(p_{\perp}\) spectrum, pseudorapidity distribution, and \(E_{\perp}\) flow).
