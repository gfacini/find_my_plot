To establish the Electroweak Symmetry Breaking mechanism of the Standard Model (SM), not only the Higgs boson has to be discovered, but its potential has to be determined experimentally via the measurement of the Higgs self-couplings.

In this note the accessibility of the SM Higgs self-couplings at the LHC through the measurement of the cross section for Higgs pairs production is studied. The study focus on the mass range \(150~{}GeV\leq m_{H}\leq 200~{}GeV\), where the Higgs decays mainly in WW or ZZ. The most promising channels for the signal observation are identified and the dominant SM backgrounds are evaluated. For standard LHC operation and integrated luminositues, the signal rates expected are too low to reliably extract the Higgs pairs production signal from the dominant backgrounds.

The potential of a superLHC with an upgraded luminosity of the order of \(10^{35}cm^{-2}s^{-1}\) is also evaluated. Assuming optimistically the same detector performances as at design LHC luminosities and a integrated luminosity of \(6000~{}fb^{-1}\) for ATLAS and CMS combined, one may hope to extract a measurement of the signal cross section and therefore the Higgs trilinear self-coupling to an accuracy of about \(20\%\).

Introduction

The discovery of the Higgs boson will give the first striking confirmation on the origin of masses as described in the Standard Model (SM). However, to fully establish the electroweak symmetry breaking mechanism, the Higgs sector has to be tested in greater detail and in particular the Higgs potential has to be measured experimentally.

The Higgs potential \(V_{H}\) can be expressed in terms of the physics Higgs field H as: \(V_{H}=\frac{m_{H}^{2}}{2}H^{2}+\frac{m_{H}^{2}}{2v}H^{3}+\frac{m_{H}^{4}}{8v^{2 }}H^{4}\), where \(m_{H}\) is the Higgs mass and \(v=(\sqrt{2G_{F}})^{-1/2}\simeq 246GeV\) is the Higgs vacuum expectation value. The coefficients of the second and third terms are proportional respectively to the strength of the Higgs trilinear (\(\lambda_{HHH}=3m_{H}^{2}/v\)) and quartic (\(\lambda_{HHHH}=3m_{H}^{2}/v^{2}\)) Higgs self-couplings [1]. As \(\lambda_{HHHH}\) is typically two orders of magnitude lower than \(\lambda_{HHH}\) this work is focused on the accessibility at the LHC of the trilinear self-couplings.

The strength of the trilinear coupling influences the production rate of Higgs pairs in the SM, so that the Higgs potential can be accessed experimentally through the measurement of the cross section for Higgs-pair production.

At the LHC pairs of Higgses could be produced via different mechanisms: gluon fusion (\(gg\to HH\)) shown in fig. 1, WW or ZZ fusion (\(WW,ZZ\to HH\)) shown in fig. 2 and W or Z-strahlung (\(WHH\) and \(ZHH\)) shown in fig. 3. For all channels, the first diagram on the left is sensitive to the Higgs self-coupling strength while those on the right are not.

Fig. 4 shows the cross section behavior as a function of the Higgs mass for the different possible production mechanisms.

This study considers topologies arising from gluon gluon fusion which have the highest cross section, ranging at LO [3] from \(5.35fb\) for \(m_{H}=200GeV\) to about \(20fb\) for \(m_{H}=120GeV\). The complete calculation at NLO [4] proved that the K-factor is of the order of 1.5-2 over all the mass range. LO values were used for the normalisation of the signal cross section, to remain consistent with the current accuracy in the main background calculations.

The Higgs decays mainly into \(b\bar{b}\) if its mass is below \(130~{}GeV\). In this case, \(pp\to HH\) generates four b quarks in the final state which is already known [2] to be a very challenging topology even for processes with higher cross section. Therefore this study is focused at higher masses, namely on \(150~{}GeV\leq m_{H}\leq 200~{}GeV\), where the Higgs-pair production rate is slightly lower but still sizable. In this mass range the Higgs decays mainly into WW and ZZ and therefore can generate central leptons in the final state which could be used to extract the signal from the overwhelming QCD background.

All the processes with highest \(\sigma*BR\) having at least two leptons (muon or electron) in the final state were considered in this work:

1. \(pp\to HH\to WWWW\to lvqqlvqq\) (\(\sigma*BR\simeq 0.24fb^{-1}\) for \(m_{H}=200GeV\))
2. \(pp\to HH\to WWWW\to lvlvqqqq\) (\(\sigma*BR\simeq 0.12fb^{-1}\) for \(m_{H}=200GeV\))
3. \(pp\to HH\to WWWW\to lvlvlvqq\) (\(\sigma*BR\simeq 0.072fb^{-1}\) for \(m_{H}=200GeV\))
4. \(pp\to HH\to WWWW\to lvlvlv\) (\(\sigma*BR\simeq 0.006fb^{-1}\) for \(m_{H}=200GeV\))
5. \(pp\to HH\to WWZZ\to qqqllqq\) (\(\sigma*BR\simeq 0.09fb^{-1}\) for \(m_{H}=200GeV\))
6. \(pp\to HH\to WWZZ\to lvqqlqq\) (\(\sigma*BR\simeq 0.055fb^{-1}\) for \(m_{H}=200GeV\))

In the following this ordering is maintained when referring to the various channels. The first two processes lead to the same topology in the final state. They were studied separately as they have different kinematic and charge properties because the leptons originate from different Higgs bosons in the first case and from the same Higgs boson in the second.

As the production rate of Higgs pairs is very low, luminosity was a crucial issue in the study. Two reference frameworks were considered: a standard LHC scenario, with instantaneous luminosity of \(10^{34}cm^{-2}s^{-1}\), which is expected to produce about \(600fb^{-1}\) shared between ATLAS and CMS; a superLHC scenario, with an instantaneous luminosity of \(10^{35}cm^{-2}s^{-1}\), which would allow perhaps to collect up to \(6000fb^{-1}\).

The rest of the note describes the study performed to evaluate the possibility of measuring the Higgs-pair production cross section and extracting the Higgs trilinear self-couplings at the LHC and superLHC. Section 2 specifies the MonteCarlo samples used for the analysis. The selections developed to extract the signal are described in section 3 for the different topologies considered. Results are summarised in section 4 for the standard LHC and in section 5 for the superLHC scenarios. Conclusions are drawn in section 6.

## 2 MonteCarlo samples

To study the accessibility of Higgs-pair production at the LHC several MonteCarlo samples of signal were produced, with different Higgs masses and final state topologies, as well as the main corresponding SM backgrounds. In the following paragraphs the generators used or modified to produce such processes are detailed.

### Signal

At the time of the analysis, no generator existed for the signal production, but the matrix element for Higgs-pair production in the gluon gluon fusion channel was available from the program HPAIR [5]. The same approach used by the program described in [6] was used: the generation of Supersymmetric Higgs pairs was achieved, adding the corresponding HPAIR matrix element to PYTHIA [7]. The program was adapted to the SM case and it was verified that the cross sections produced by HPAIR stand-alone or in the PYTHIA implementation were consistent in the Higgs mass range considered.

In each of the six topologies, \(100.000\) Higgs events where produced for Higgs masses from \(150GeV\) to \(200GeV\) in steps of \(10GeV\).

A characteristic feature of the signal is the presence of several central high-\(p_{T}\) leptons and/or jets in the final state. The plots in fig. 5 show the generated \(p_{T}\) (left) and \(|\eta|\) (right) distributions of quarks and leptons produced from Higgs-boson decays in Higgs-pair production.

### SM Backgrounds

PYTHIA was used to generate the largest SM backgrounds having final states with at least two leptons (muon or electron): \(t\bar{t},WW,WZ,ZZ,WH,ZH\). All these processes could be accompanied by initial or final state radiation providing additional jets. WH and ZH were generated for Higgs masses ranging from \(150~{}GeV\) to \(200~{}GeV\) in steps of \(10~{}GeV\). In addition \(Zb\bar{b}\), \(Wb\bar{b}\) and \(Wt\bar{t}\) events were also generated with a modified version of PYTHIA as described in [10]. Table 1 summarises the processes simulated, the corresponding cross sections and the numbers of events generated.

For the first signal topology, some additional background sources were estimated [8] through the integration of the exact matrix element in the phase space defined by the selection cuts. Appropriate correction factor were included to account for differences

Figure 5: Generated \(p_{T}\) (left) and \(|\eta|\) (right) distributions of quarks and leptons originated in Higgs decaysbetween parton-level cuts and those applied after the fast simulation of the ATLAS detector (e.g. jet reconstruction efficiency, b-tagging performance, etc...) This approach was used to estimate the \(t\bar{t}t\bar{t}\) and \(WWW\) contamination since no event generator was available. A cross-check was performed on the \(Wt\bar{t}\) sample at the final stage of the selection to evaluate the reliability of the matrix element estimate (which was available for \(Wt\bar{t}\)) comparing its prediction to the number obtained from generating the events and processing them through the whole analysis stream. The two estimates agree at the 5% level.

Existing samples [9] were used to demonstrate that no contamination was expected from QCD and W or Z plus light-jet events.

## 3 Selections

Once the events were generated, they were passed through the standard ATLAS fast simulation chain [11], using for the energy- momentum resolution and for the pile-up the values expected for an instantaneous luminosity of \(10^{34}cm^{-2}s^{-1}\). Standard b-tagging efficiency and jet energy calibration corrections where also applied. In the study for the superLHC scenario it was optimistically assumed that ATLAS would provide similar detector performance to the standard case and no additional pile-up nor energy smearing were added to the simulation.

A preselection was first applied to retain only those events having a sufficient number of high-\(p_{T}\) leptons and/or jets in the central region of the detector (\(|\eta|<2.4\)) to be compatible with the signal considered. Only events satisfying one of these mutually exclusive requirements were accepted:

* TOPOLOGY 1: two -and no more than two- central and isolated leptons (electrons or muons) with \(p_{T}>10\ GeV\), two central jets with \(p_{T}>30\ GeV\) and two additional central jets with \(p_{T}>20\ GeV\)

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|} \hline Process & \(\sigma*BR(fb)\) & Events generated \\ \hline \(HH\), \(m_{H}=150-200\ GeV\) & 10.6-5.3 & \(10^{5}\) for each mass \\ \hline \(t\bar{t}\) & 24400 & \(3.0*10^{8}\) \\ \hline \(WW\) & 7030 & \(1.4*10^{7}\) \\ \hline \(ZZ\) & 1200 & \(1.0*10^{7}\) \\ \hline \(WZ\) & 5878 & \(1.2*10^{7}\) \\ \hline \(WH\), \(m_{H}=150-200\ GeV\) & 615-245 & \(6.0*10^{6}\) for each mass \\ \hline \(ZH\), \(m_{H}=150-200\ GeV\) & 342-138 & \(5.0*10^{6}\) for each mass \\ \hline \(Zbb\) & 16580 & \(1.0*10^{7}\) \\ \hline \(Wbb\) & 21570 & \(1.0*10^{7}\) \\ \hline \(Wt\bar{t}\) & 37.2 & \(8.0*10^{5}\) \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}

* TOPOLOGY 2: three -and no more than three- central and isolated leptons (electrons or muons) with \(p_{T}>\) 10 \(GeV\) and two central jets with \(p_{T}>\) 30 \(GeV\)
* TOPOLOGY 3: at least four central and isolated leptons (electrons or muons) with \(p_{T}>\) 10 \(GeV\)

In addition, to meet the trigger requirements, one of the leptons was required to have \(p_{T}>\) 30 \(GeV\) or two of them were required to have \(p_{T}\geq\) 20 \(GeV\). Each lepton was assumed to be reconstructed with a 90% identification efficiency, independently of the momentum and flavour.

Below are detailed the selections developed in the different channels to extract the signal from the huge SM backgrounds. All the cuts were tuned for a Higgs signal with \(m_{H}=200\)\(GeV\) which corresponds to the lowest cross section. Unless otherwise stated, the normalisation of the histograms refers to an integrated luminosity of 600\(fb^{-1}\).

### \(pp\to HH\to WWWW\to lvqqlvqq\)

This is the best channel for a possible observation so the selections are described in greater detail. Events from TOPOLOGY 1 were selected with a signal efficiency of 38% and a starting S/B of the order of \(2*10^{-4}\). The signal has 4 jets from W decays. The somewhat lower \(p_{T}\) cut applied to two of these jets, defined in TOPOLOGY 1, were motivated by the relatively soft spectrum of the quarks generated from the Higgs decays.

At preselection level the background was completely dominated by \(t\bar{t}jj\to WbWbjj\to l\nu bl\nu bjj\) events which have b-jets and leptons of opposite charge in the final state. In the signal, on the contrary, jets generated from light quarks produced in W decays and the two leptons can have same or opposite charge, depending if they are produced in the decay of W from the same or different Higgses. Fig. 6 (7) shows the b jet content (sum of lepton charges) for signal and \(t\bar{t}\) events. Events with either tagged b-jets or no leptons of same sign were rejected. The previous cuts reduced \(t\bar{t}\) by a factor 100, losing 50% of the

Figure 6: b-jet multiplicity for \(t\bar{t}\) (left) and signal (right)

HH events. In fact in the signal all the events with leptons generated from the same Higgs were lost, which corresponds to half of the sample. Misidentification of lepton charge was assumed to be negligible because the leptons under study are of rather low \(p_{T}\).

After this stage, the dominant background was composed by \(t\bar{t}\to WbWb\to lvbqqb\) with two non identified b jets and one fake isolated lepton from the b decay chain. The lepton's \(p_{T}\) spectrum and isolation were used to reject these events. Leptons from b decays tend to be softer, as can be seen in fig. 8, and less isolated than those produced in W decays. To exploit the isolation properties the tracking information was used. All the reconstructed tracks in the event with \(p_{T}>0.5~{}GeV\) were considered. As a first step a track-lepton match was performed, minimising their distance. The maximum allowed distance

Figure 7: Sum of leptons charge for \(t\bar{t}\) (left) and signal (right)

was \(\Delta R=0.2\) to reject pathological associations. Then, the properties of the tracks contained in a cone of radius \(\Delta R=0.4\) around the direction of the track identified as a lepton were studied: the number of tracks, their total \(p_{T}\), their impact parameters etc... Fig. 9 and 10 show the distributions of the number of tracks and their total \(|p_{T}|\) for the signal (left) and background (right). The study was repeated for a larger cone size of \(\Delta R=0.7\). The best discrimination was achieved with the following set of cuts: both leptons with \(p_{T}\) above \(20~{}GeV\); in a cone of \(\Delta R=0.4\) around each lepton at most one charged track was allowed and its \(p_{T}\) should not exceed \(1~{}GeV\). This improved the rejection against \(t\bar{t}\) by about a factor 30 with an efficiency of 66% on the signal. This efficiency is probably overestimated since pile up effects are not taken into account in the fast simulation used. Further studies with full simulation should be performed to validate this approach.

Since a full simulation study has not been performed to fully validate these results, it was verified that requiring both leptons to have \(p_{T}>30~{}GeV\) would have a similar

Figure 9: Number of charged tracks contained in a cone of \(\Delta R=0.4\) around the softest lepton for \(t\bar{t}\) (left) and signal (right)

rejection power again \(t\bar{t}\) to that obtained with the tracking isolation cuts discussed above and only a relative 5% percent lower efficiency for the signal.

At this stage, the \(t\bar{t}\) contamination was comparable to that from \(t\bar{t}t\bar{t}\) and \(WWW\) events. To suppress \(t\bar{t}t\bar{t}\), which contain 2 high-\(p_{T}\) leptons and 8 high-\(p_{T}\) jets, with a cross section of the order of \(12fb^{-1}\), only events with no more than 6 central jets with \(p_{T}>30~{}GeV\) were accepted. This cut rejects 90% of \(t\bar{t}t\bar{t}\) events and only 2% of the signal as shown in fig. 11.

\(WWW\) events include the resonant production \(WH\to WWW\), which was simulated, and a continuum component. In both cases, the final state \(WWW\to l\nu l\nu qq\) contains only one jet pair with invariant mass equal to the W mass, while two of them are expected in HH events. Therefore, for all possible combinations of 4 jets with \(p_{T}>20~{}GeV\), \(\chi_{ijkl}=\sqrt{(m_{ij}-m_{W})^{2}+(m_{kl}-m_{W})^{2}}\) was computed, where \(m_{ij}\) indicates the invariant mass of the jet pair (i,j) and \(m_{W}\) the W mass. A final selection cut was then

applied, requiring \(\chi_{min}=Min_{ijkl}(\chi_{ijkl})<20\ GeV\). The distribution of \(\chi_{min}\) for WH and HH events is shown in fig. 12.

Table 2 summarises the selection efficiency for the signal and the dominant simulated backgrounds as a function of the cut progression.

The selection efficiency evaluated on the full HH sample (all possible Higgs decay channels) was found to be 0.64%.

The final numbers of events expected for the signal and all the backgrounds, including the estimates for \(t\bar{t}t\bar{t}\) and \(WWW\) from the matrix element calculation, are detailed in the result sections for the two different luminosity options considered.

### \(pp\to HH\to WWWW\to lvlvqqqq\)

Events from TOPOLOGY 1 were selected with a signal efficiency of 40% and a starting S/B of the order of about \(4*10^{-5}\). The main background was from \(t\bar{t}\).

Leptons of opposite charge are expected both from the signal and \(t\bar{t}\) therefore the powerful constraint used in the previous topology could not be used. After the b-tagging

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|} \hline Cuts & Signal & \(t\bar{t}\) & WW & ZZ & WZ & WH & ZH & Wtt \\ \hline topology 1 & 38\% & \(4.8*10^{-2}\) & \(1.2*10^{-5}\) & \(6.7*10^{-3}\) & \(2.1*10^{-5}\) & \(4.8*10^{-3}\) & \(9.8*10^{-3}\) & \(1.8*10^{-1}\) \\ \hline anti b-tag & 32\% & \(9.0*10^{-3}\) & \(7.1*10^{-6}\) & \(5.0*10^{-3}\) & \(1.7*10^{-5}\) & \(3.9*10^{-3}\) & \(7.4*10^{-3}\) & \(3.2*10^{-2}\) \\ \hline same lepton charge & 16\% & \(3.2*10^{-5}\) & \(3.2*10^{-8}\) & \(1.5*10^{-6}\) & \(6.8*10^{-6}\) & \(6.0*10^{-4}\) & \(2.0*10^{-4}\) & \(3.2*10^{-2}\) \\ \hline b-lepton rejection & 10.6\% & \(1.1*10^{-6}\) & 0 & \(1.6*10^{-7}\) & \(4.2*10^{-6}\) & \(3.7*10^{-4}\) & \(1.2*10^{-4}\) & \(2.2*10^{-2}\) \\ \hline jet multiplicity & 10.1\% & \(1.1*10^{-6}\) & 0 & 0 & \(4.2*10^{-5}\) & \(3.7*10^{-4}\) & \(1.2*10^{-4}\) & \(2.2*10^{-2}\) \\ \hline \(\chi_{min}\) & 8.6\% & \(6.3*10^{-7}\) & 0 & 0 & \(1.6*10^{-5}\) & \(2.5*10^{-4}\) & \(7.0*10^{-5}\) & \(1.4*10^{-2}\) \\ \hline \end{tabular}

veto, the \(\chi_{min}\) algorithm was applied, as in 3.1, to identify the best jet pair association and it was requested \(\chi_{min}\)\(<\)\(20GeV\). The signal has the additional feature that the four jets originate from the same Higgs boson. It was therefore requested that the 4 jets, which minimise the \(\chi_{ijkl}\) function, had an invariant mass compatible with the Higgs mass: \(|m_{ijkl}-m_{H}|<50GeV\). Fig 13 shows the distribution of the reconstructed Higgs mass, for the signal and the dominant \(t\bar{t}\) background. The resolution on the reconstructed mass was about 25 GeV for signal events.

At the end of these cuts the selection efficiency was around 20% for the signal and \(2*10^{-3}\)\(t\bar{t}\) were selected, bringing the S/B to about \(10^{-4}\). Due to the smallness of the signal cross section, and the very similar final state, it seems to be difficult to improve significantly the rejection of \(t\bar{t}\) while keeping the signal at an observable level.

The selection efficiency evaluated on all the HH sample was found to be 2%. The final numbers of events expected for the signal and the simulated backgrounds are detailed in the result sections for the two different luminosity options considered.

### \(pp\to HH\to WWWW\to lvlvlvqq\)

Events from TOPOLOGY 2 where preselected with a signal efficiency of 30% and a S/B ratio of about \(5*10^{-4}\). Then, the following set of cuts was applied:

* no b-tagged jets
* all three leptons with \(p_{T}\geq 25\ GeV\).
* rejection of leptons from non-identified b quarks as in section 3.1
* veto of events having a pair of opposite charge leptons with invariant mass satisfying the condition: \(|m_{ll}-m_{Z}|<5\ GeV\)
* at least one pair of jets having an invariant mass compatible with the W mass: \(|m_{jj}-m_{W}|<30\ GeV\)

Figure 14: \(P_{T}\) distribution of the softest lepton for \(t\bar{t}\) (left) and signal (right)

The first three selections aimed to reject \(t\bar{t}\), the highest background in this channel. Fig 14 shows the \(p_{T}\) distribution of the softest lepton for the signal (right) and \(t\bar{t}\) (left). After these cuts \(t\bar{t}\) where rejected down to the level of \(WZ\) events for a global S/B=\(10^{-2}\). The fourth requirement was added to suppress \(WZ\), by requiring two leptons generated in a Z decay. Fig 15 shows the invariant mass distribution of lepton pairs of opposite charge for signal (right) and \(WZ\) events (left). The fifth cut was added to suppress further both dominant backgrounds which, contrary to the signal, do not contain a pair of jets from a W decay. At the end of these cuts the selection efficiency was around 8% for signal, \(6*10^{-6}\) both for \(t\bar{t}\), and \(WZ\), bringing the S/B to \(5*10^{-2}\). A harder cut on the lepton transverse momentum (\(p_{T}\geq 30~{}GeV\)) would kill most of the remaining \(t\bar{t}\). The selection efficiency would go around 5% for signal, \(10^{-7}\) for \(t\bar{t}\), and \(5*10^{-6}\) for \(WZ\), bringing the S/B to \(7*10^{-2}\), with a slight decrease in sensitivity.

Due to the smallness of the signal cross section, it seems to be very difficult to improve significantly the rejection of the backgrounds while keeping the signal at an observable level.

The selection efficiency evaluated on the HH sample was found to be 0.1%. The final numbers of events expected for the signal and the simulated backgrounds are detailed in the result sections for the two different luminosity options considered.

### \(pp\to HH\to WWWW\to lvlvlvlv\)

Events from TOPOLOGY 4 where preselected with a signal efficiency of 36% and a S/B ratio of \(7*10^{-3}\). The dominant backgrounds were found to be \(t\bar{t}\) and \(ZH\). To improve the signal significance it was required:

* all four leptons with \(p_{T}\geq 20~{}GeV\)
* veto of events having a pair of opposite sign leptons with invariant mass \(|m_{ll}-m_{Z}|\)\(<\) 5 \(GeV\)

Figure 15: Invariant mass distribution of opposite charge lepton pairs for \(WZ\) (left) and signal (right)

The first requirement rejects the bulk of \(t\bar{t}\) where two of the leptons are softer as they are produced within jets. Fig. 16 shows the \(p_{T}\) distribution of the softest lepton for \(t\bar{t}\) (left) and for the signal (right). The second request suppresses \(ZH\) events with the Z decaying leptonically. At the end of these cuts the selection efficiency was around 20% for the signal, \(10^{-6}\) for \(t\bar{t}\) and \(10^{-5}\) for \(ZH\), bringing the S/B up to \(5*10^{-2}\).

The selection efficiency evaluated on all the HH sample was found to be \(3*10^{-4}\). Due to the smallness of the signal cross section, it seems to be very difficult to improve significantly the rejection of the backgrounds while keeping the signal at an observable level.

The final numbers of events expected for the signal and the simulated backgrounds are detailed in the result sections for the two different luminosity options considered.

### \(pp\to HH\to WWZZ\to qqqlqqq\)

Events from TOPOLOGY 1 were preselected with a signal efficiency of 36% and a S/B ratio of \(4*10^{-5}\), the simulated background being largely dominated by \(t\bar{t}\). Therefore the following set of cuts was applied:

* two opposite sign leptons with invariant mass satisfying: \(|m_{ll}-m_{Z}|<5~{}GeV\)
* at least 6 central jets with \(p_{T}>\) 20 \(GeV\)
* no b-tagged jets.
* at least three different pairs of jets with invariant mass in the range 50-120 \(GeV\)

The first two requirements specify better the signal topology. In fact, in this channel, HH events are characterised by a Z decaying leptonically plus three other gauge bosons decaying hadronically, that give rise to 6 high-\(p_{T}\) jets. In \(t\bar{t}\), instead, leptons come from different W decays and therefore do not peak at the Z mass. In addition only two high \(p_{T}\) b-jets are expected from top decays. Fig. 17 shows the lepton invariant mass for \(t\bar{t}\) (left)

Figure 16: \(P_{T}\) distribution of the softest lepton for \(t\bar{t}\) (left) and signal (right)

and for the signal (right). The third cut removes 96% of the remaining \(t\bar{t}\), but rejects also some signal events with b quarks generated by the Z decaying hadronically. Finally the last selection imposes a loose compatibility of the jets with W/Z hadronic decays. Fig. 18 shows the number of jet pairs having three invariant masses in the range \(50-120GeV\), for \(t\bar{t}\) (left) and for the signal (right).

At the end of these cuts the selection efficiency was around 15% for the signal, \(4*10^{-5}\) for \(t\bar{t}\) and \(4*10^{-4}\) for \(ZZ\) (that represented the second highest background), while the S/B was of the order of 1%.

The next step was to reconstruct further the Higgs masses in the semileptonic and fully hadronic decays. To choose the jet pairs the function \(\chi_{ijkhst}=\sqrt{(m_{ij}-m_{W})^{2}+(m_{kh}-m_{W})^{2}+(m_{st}-m_{Z})^{2}}\) was minimised, considering all different

jets \(i,j,k,h,s,t\) with \(p_{T}\geq 20\ GeV\). Then the Higgs masses were reconstructed in the hadronic channel as \((m_{H})_{jjjj}=m_{ijkh}\) and the Higgs mass in the semileptonic channel as \((m_{H})_{lljj}=m_{llst}\) where 1 stands for lepton. Figure 19 shows the reconstructed Higgs mass in the leptonic channel for \(t\bar{t}\) and \(ZZ\) (left) and for the signal (right). Requiring the reconstructed Higgs masses to be within 30-40 GeV from the nominal value improved the \(S/B\), but degraded the sensitivity on the signal \(S/\sqrt{B}\). This cut was not applied.

The selection efficiency evaluated on all the HH sample was found to be 0.5%. The final numbers of events expected for the signal and the simulated backgrounds are detailed in the result sections for the two different luminosity options considered.

### \(pp\to HH\to WWZZ\to lvqqllqq\)

Events from TOPOLOGY 2 were preselected with a signal efficiency of 30% and a S/B ratio of \(2*10^{-3}\). The dominant simulated background at this stage was found to come once again from \(t\bar{t}\) events. To extract the signal the additional set of cuts was applied:

* two additional central jets with \(p_{T}>20\ GeV\)
* at least one pair of opposite sign leptons with invariant mass satisfying: \(|m_{ll}-m_{Z}|\)\(<\) 5 \(GeV\)
* all 3 leptons with \(p_{T}\geq 20\ GeV\)
* no b-tagged jets.
* rejection of b leptons from un-identified b-jets as described in 3.1

The first two cuts reject the bulk of \(t\bar{t}\) events, bringing the \(S/B\) to 2% and maintaining the signal selection efficiency above 20 %. In fact, in this channel, HH events have a Z

decaying leptonically and two other gauge bosons decaying hadronically, that give raise to 4 high \(p_{T}\) jets. In \(t\bar{t}\), instead, the leptons do not peak in mass and only two high \(pt\) b-jets are generated in top decays. Fig. 20 shows the invariant mass distribution of all pairs of opposite sign leptons for the \(t\bar{t}\) and the signal. In HH events the peak of the Z is recognisable above the flat distribution from wrong lepton parings.

At that point the dominant background was still \(t\bar{t}\) events, having a fake isolated lepton generated from a b-quark decay. The following three cuts were then added to suppress such fake leptons. First of all, events with tagged b-jets were removed. It should be noted that HH events with a Z decaying in two identified b-jets where rejected by this cut. The final cut was applied because leptons from b-quarks tend to be softer and less isolated than those from a gauge boson decay.

After these selections the \(S/B\) went up to 7% and the main background was composed of \(ZH\) and \(WZ\) events. The selection efficiency was around 8% for the signal, \(10^{-6}\) for \(t\bar{t}\), \(4*10^{-4}\) for \(ZH\) and \(10^{-5}\) for \(WZ\) events.

To suppress \(ZH\) and \(WZ\) the mass peak of the Higgs decaying as \(H\to ZZ\to llqq\) was reconstructed. The combination of opposite sign leptons with invariant mass closer to the mass of the Z was used. For the hadronic Z, all jets with \(p_{T}\geq 20~{}GeV\) were considered and the pair (i,j) minimising the function \(\chi_{ij}=\sqrt{(m_{ij}-m_{Z})^{2}+(m_{kh}-m_{W})^{2}}\) was chosen. Fig. 21 shows the reconstructed Higgs mass in the leptonic channel for \(ZH\) (left) and for the signal (right). Requiring the reconstructed Higgs mass to be within 30-40 GeV from the nominal value improved the \(S/B\) to 10%, but degraded the sensitivity on the signal \(S/\sqrt{B}\). This cut was not applied.

The selection efficiency evaluated on all the HH sample was found to be 0.2%. The final numbers of events expected for the signal and the simulated backgrounds are detailed in the result sections for the two different luminosity options considered.

## 4 Results in the standard LHC scenario

Table 3 summarises, for the various channels considered, the numbers of events expected for the HH signal for \(m_{H}=200~{}GeV\) and the dominant backgrounds for a total integrated luminosity of \(600fb^{-1}\).

The \(Wb\bar{b}\) contamination is negligible in all channels. In none of the channels \(S/\sqrt{B}\) exceeded 1.2 \(\sigma\). The best discrimination was achieved in the first channel for which the magnitude of all major backgrounds, including \(WWW\) and \(t\bar{t}t\bar{t}\), was estimated. For the other topologies the total background, \(S/B\) and \(S/\sqrt{B}\) were computed using only the backgrounds available from simulation since the significance turned out to be already too low for observing the signal. It should be noted that, due to the small cross section, the number of signal events selected is very low in all topologies and it is therefore unlikely that the significance can be improved with further sequential cuts.

The analysis developed for the first channel was extended to the full range of masses of interest. The results are summarised in table 4. The increase in the total backgrounds at lower Higgs masses is due to the increase of the cross section for \(WH\) and \(ZH\) production. For lower Higgs masses, the signal cross section increases, but below \(160~{}GeV\), the Higgs branching ratio in \(WW\) starts to drop. The best significance, computed from the simulated backgrounds, was achieved for \(m_{H}=170~{}GeV\) and corresponds to 2 sigmas. For this mass the contribution of \(t\bar{t}t\bar{t}\) and \(WWW\) was also estimated: the significance, including all backgrounds, was then found to be 1.7.

These studies showed that, in the standard LHC scenario, even considering the whole luminosity potential of ATLAS and CMS combined, it will be very difficult to observe H pair production. A further reduction of at least a factor of ten of the background contamination would be needed. However, it is important to point out that the results presented were obtained with a simple analysis, based on sequential cuts, and the rejection might improve with a likelihood or neural network approach. At the present stage of availability and reliability of the background and detector simulation, and in the absence of a direct cross-check on data control samples, such a sophisticated approach appeared to be premature.

### Comparison to another work in this field.

After a part of this study appeared in [12], an independent evaluation on the accessibility of the Higgs trilinear self-coupling at the LHC appeared in [13] with a different conclusion. It explored the Higgs-mass range 150-200 \(GeV\) through the process \(pp\to HH\to(W^{+}W^{-})(W^{+}W^{-})\to(l^{\pm}\nu qq)(l^{\pm}\nu qq)\). The study was performed at parton level considering HH-signal events and only \(WWW\) and \(Wt\bar{t}\) as dominant backgrounds. No sensitivity on the cross section measurement was reported. The final precision quoted on the self coupling measurement was 60% for an integrated luminosity of 300 \(fb^{-1}\) while a 10-25% improvement on the sensitivity was expected doubling the luminosity.

To understand the differences between the results reported in [13] and those reported here, the analysis described in [13] was repeated using the signal and backgrounds samples already generated with the ATLAS fast simulation for the study that was described in this paper. The comparison was performed for a Higgs mass of 200 \(GeV\).

As a first step, the following set of cuts were applied to \(HH\), \(t\bar{t}\), \(WH\) and \(Wt\bar{t}\) events:

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|} \hline Mass (GeV) & 150 & 160 & 170 & 180 & 190 & 200 \\ \hline HH signal & 17 & 28 & 35 & 28 & 19 & 22 \\ \hline \(t\bar{t}t\bar{t}\) & - & - & 3 & - & - & 3 \\ \hline \(WWW\) & - & - & 240 & - & - & 150 \\ \hline Total simulated bkg & (205) & (215) & 424(225) & (222) & (223) & 333(217) \\ \hline \(S/\sqrt{B}\) & (1.2) & (1.9) & 1.7(2.) & (1.9) & (1.2) & 1.2(1.5) \\ \hline \end{tabular}

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|} \hline  & \(lqqqlvqq\) & \(lvqlvqq\) & \(lvlvlvqq\) & \(lvlvlvlv\) & \(llqqqqqq\) & \(lvqllqq\) \\ \hline HH \(m_{H}=200~{}GeV\) & 22 & 58 & 5.8 & 1. & 16 & 6.0 \\ \hline \(tt\) & 9 & 33678 & 79. & 15. & 665 & 17 \\ \hline \(WW\) & 0 & 122 & 0. & 0. & 0 & 0 \\ \hline \(ZZ\) & 0 & 1240 & 0.3 & 0 & 288 & 1.8 \\ \hline \(WZ\) & 6 & 10 & 16.0 & 0 & 0 & 33.7 \\ \hline \(WWW\) all processes & 150 & - & - & - & - & - \\ \(WH\) only & 37 & 183 & 7.1 & 1.9 & 50 & 12.4 \\ \hline \(ZH\) & 6 & 322 & 14.1 & 11. & 98 & 33.2 \\ \hline \(Wtt\) & 159 & 0 & 0. & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ \hline \(Zbb\) & 0 & 104 & 0. & 0 & 28 & 0 \\ \hline \(tttt\) & 3 & - & - & - & - & - \\ \hline Total B & 333 & 35659 & 117. & 27.9 & 1129 & 98.4 \\ \hline \(S/B\) & 0.07 & \(2*10^{-3}\) & 0.05 & 0.04 & 0.01 & 0.06 \\ \hline \(S/\sqrt{B}\) & 1.2 & 0.3 & 0.53 & 0.19 & 0.5 & 0.61 \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 3: Numbers of HH signal (\(m_{H}=200~{}GeV\)) and background events expected for an integrated luminosity of 600 \(fb^{-1}\). Also shown are the expected numbers for the total background \(B\), the signal-to-background ratio \(S/B\) and the signal statistical significance \(S/\sqrt{B}\).

* two leptons with \(p_{T}\geq 10,15\ GeV\) in the range \(|\eta|\leq 2.5\)
* four jets with \(p_{T}\geq 30,30,20,20\ GeV\) in the range \(|\eta|\leq 3\)
* no tagged b-jets
* same-sign leptons
* two jet pairs with invariant mass compatible with a W: \(50\ GeV\leq m_{jj}\leq 110\) GeV

The first cut is too loose to satisfy the ATLAS trigger requirements, but it was maintained to make the comparison with the results of [13] easier. The following steps were based on kinematic variables involving the 4 jets which come from W decays for the HH signal: the minimum \(\Delta R\) between the jets and the invariant mass of the jets plus the two leptons. In contrast to the parton-level analysis of [13], the HH signal in this study contains extra jets from initial and final-state radiation in addition to those coming from W decays. There is not a strong \(p_{T}\)-hierarchy observed between jets of different origin since the W spectrum is relatively soft. To choose among the different possible pairings, several approaches were tried: using all jets, using the 4 jets with highest \(p_{T}\), using the jet pairings that minimise the \(\chi_{ijkl}\) function as described in section 3.1. In addition, these three approaches were applied to all jets with \(p_{T}\geq 20\ GeV\) and to the subsample satisfying the second and the last cut described above.

The best discrimination was obtained using the jet pairings that minimise \(\chi_{ijkl}\) and requiring \(\Delta R_{min}\geq 0.7\).

The distributions of \(\Delta R_{min}\) and \(m_{vis}\), are shown in fig. 22 for \(HH\), \(WH\), \(Wt\bar{t}\) and \(t\bar{t}\) events. It is clear that even if these variables have some discriminating power, the rejection obtained is lower than what was achieved at parton level due to the presence of additional jets from initial and final-state. In addition this study shows that the \(t\bar{t}\) contamination is not negligible as assumed in [13] and that it is due to events where one of the leptons

Figure 22: Distributions of the minimum \(\Delta R\) between jets (left) and of the invariant mass of the jets-leptons system (right), for the HH signal and the dominant backgrounds.

comes from a b-jet. The rejection achieved on \(t\bar{t}\) events is of the order of \(10^{-7}\) and the results depend critically on the description of the tails of the discriminating variables. Finally the overall efficiency obtained in this study for the HH signal is significantly lower than that obtained in [13][14], an understandable effect often observed in comparaisons between parton-level analysis and full parton shower simulations.

The cut on \(\Delta R_{min}\) is slightly lower than in [13] since this optimises the sensitivity. The final numbers of events expected for an integrated luminosity of 600 \(fb^{-1}\) are reported in table 5 for the HH signal and the \(WH\), \(Wt\bar{t}\) and \(t\bar{t}\) backgrounds. Reported is also the effect of an additional cut on \(m_{vis}\leq 500\ GeV\): even if some background events are rejected by this cut, the signal sensitivity slightly decreases due the small number of HH events available.

It should be noted that the continuum component of \(WWW\) events is not reported. Based on the previous experience one expects it to be, of the order of 2-3 times the \(WH\) component after the first set of cuts. The effect of the last two selections is difficult to estimate without simulation. Only the \(WH\) contribution was then included in the sensitivity quoted, \(S/\sqrt{B}\) =1.1, which is therefore overestimated. Due to the very small number of signal events, a further selection to reject leptons from b-jets in order to kill \(t\bar{t}\) as in section 3.1, does not improve significantly the sensitivity.

It was also checked that no significant improvement on the signal significance was achieved comparing the shapes of the \(m_{vis}\) distributions of signal plus background and background only using a \(\chi^{2}\) as suggested in [13].

From this study it appears that, once detectors effects are taken into account, the results of [13] are not confirmed.

## 5 Results in the superLHC scenario

Given the importance of the Higgs self-coupling, it appears justified to study the potential of the superLHC in this field. This section three summarises the results that could be obtained in the framework of the superLHC with an integrated luminosity of \(6000fb^{-1}\) (ATLAS and CMS combined).

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|} \hline Analysis as in [13] & No \(m_{vis}cut\) & \(m_{vis}\leq 500\ GeV\) \\ \hline HH \(m_{H}=200\ GeV\) & 22 & 17.6 \\ \hline \(t\bar{t}\) & 203 & 155 \\ \hline \(WH\) only & 39 & 25.5 \\ \hline \(Wtt\) & 132 & 86.3 \\ \hline Total B & 374 & 266.8 \\ \hline \(S/B\) & 0.06 & 0.07 \\ \hline \(S/\sqrt{B}\) & 1.14 & 1.08 \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 5: Numbers of HH signal (\(m_{H}=200\ GeV\)) and background events expected for an integrated luminosity of 600 \(fb^{-1}\) using the same approach as in [13] with and without a cut on the visible mass distribution. Also shown are the expected numbers for the total background \(B\), the signal-to-background ratio \(S/B\) and the signal statistical significance \(S/\sqrt{B}\).

### Selected events

Table 6 summarises, the number of events expected for the HH signal and dominant backgrounds together with the corresponding significance.

The \(Wb\bar{b}\) contribution is negligible in all channels. In the first channel alone a significance of almost 4 sigma maybe achieved, assuming very optimistically that the detector performance is unaffected by the additional pile up in the tracking detectors and calorimeters. For this topology, the magnitude of all major backgrounds was estimated, including \(WWW\) and \(t\bar{t}t\bar{t}\), while for the others, the significance reported was computed only with the backgrounds available from simulation.

The results for the first channel are summarised in table 7 for the other Higgs-boson masses considered. Again, the best significance is achieved for \(m_{H}=170~{}GeV\) and corresponds to 5.4 \(\sigma\).

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|} \hline  & \(lvqqlvqq\) & \(lvqqlvqq\) & \(lvlvlvqq\) & \(lvlvlvlv\) & \(llqqqqqq\) & \(lvqqllqq\) \\ \hline HH \(m_{H}=200~{}GeV\) & 220 & 580 & 58 & 11. & 160 & 60 \\ \hline \(t\bar{t}\) & 90 & 336780 & 790. & 150. & 6650 & 170 \\ \hline \(WW\) & 0 & 1225 & 0. & 0. & 0 & 0 \\ \hline \(ZZ\) & 0 & 12404 & 3.5 & 0 & 2883 & 17 \\ \hline \(WZ\) & 60 & 971 & 160 & 0 & 0 & 337 \\ \hline \(WH\) & 374 & 1831 & 71 & 19 & 505 & 124 \\ \hline \(WWW\) & 1500 & - & - & - & - & - \\ \hline \(ZH\) & 59 & 3223 & 141 & 111. & 977 & 332 \\ \hline \(Wtt\) & 1594 & 0 & 3 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ \hline \(Zbb\) & 0 & 1045 & 0. & 0 & 285 & 0 \\ \hline \(tttt\bar{t}\) & 30 & - & - & - & - & - \\ \hline Total B & 3333 & 356595 & 1169 & 279 & 11300 & 984 \\ \hline \(S/B\) & 0.07 & \(2*10^{-3}\) & 0.05 & 0.04 & 0.01 & 0.06 \\ \hline \(S/\sqrt{B}\) & 3.1 & 1. & 1.7 & 0.7 & 1.5 & 1.9 \\ \hline \end{tabular}

### Cross section estimate

With an integrated luminosity of \(6000fb^{-1}\) and the assumptions outlined above, the HH signal would be observable in the \(l\nu qql\nu qq\) topology with a statistical significance of 4-5 \(\sigma\), so the Higgs-pair production cross section could be estimated as a first step towards extracting the Higgs-boson trilinear self-coupling.

The most conservative procedure to estimate the cross section \(\sigma(HH)\) is to use a counting approach: \(\sigma=\frac{N_{data}-\epsilon N_{bkg}>}{\epsilon L}\) where \(N_{data}\) is the number of events observed, \(<N_{bkg}>\) is the number of background events predicted from the simulation, \(\epsilon\) is the signal selection efficiency and L is the total integrated luminosity of the sample. The statistical error on the cross section can then be estimated as \(\frac{d\sigma}{\sigma}\simeq\frac{\sqrt{S+B}}{S}\) (where the (small) error from \(<N_{bkg}>\) was neglected), and it was found to be \(26\%(20\%)\) for \(m_{H}=200~{}GeV\) (\(m_{H}=170~{}GeV\)). Once data will be available, the systematic uncertainties (eg on the background normalisation) will have to be kept under control at level or better than \(2\%\) using independent data samples which are easily available for the major backgrounds.

A better \(\sigma(HH)\) estimate could come from fitting the normalisation of some kinematic distribution. In this case it would be necessary to know and keep under control one or more kinematic variables for all the major backgrounds. When the analysis was performed such distributions were not available for \(t\bar{t}t\bar{t}\) and \(WWW\). However to estimate the potential improvement on the cross section measurement, the \(t\bar{t}t\bar{t}\) contribution, which was very small, was neglected and \(WWW\) distributions were obtained from those for \(WH->WWW\) scaled by the appropriate normalisation factor.

The exercise was performed with a unique variable: the cut on \(\chi_{min}\) was removed and the distribution of the reconstructed W masses for the jet pairs minimising \(\chi_{min}\) was used to fit the signal normalisation. Fig. 23 shows the results of the fit. The statistical error on the cross section using this procedure was found to be \(17\%\) for \(m_{H}=200~{}GeV\).

Figure 23: Reconstructed W boson masses: the dark area corresponds to the signal distribution and the lighter area to the total backgroundOne should be careful in interpreting this last result. In fact the diagrams of the continuum and resonant WWW production are very different and the kinematic variables could have significantly different shapes. Therefore the results above should be considered only as a proof of principle showing that a somewhat better measurement might be performed with a more sophisticated technique than the counting estimate.

### Extraction of the trilinear Higgs-boson self-couplings

The Higgs self-coupling value can be extracted from the Higgs-pair production cross section directly. Fig 24 shows for \(m_{H}=200\ GeV\) on the left and \(m_{H}=170\ GeV\) on the right, the curves relating the two values, as obtained from a version of the HPAIR program modified in order to vary the self-coupling strength. The statistical error on the self-couplings was estimated from the horizontal interval equivalent to the error on \(\sigma(HH)\).

The numbers obtained are summarised in table 8 for the reference Higgs-boson masses of \(200\ GeV\) and \(170\ GeV\) for which a complete background estimate was available. The results achieved for the cross section computed through a counting process are reported and, for illustration purposes, in the case of \(m_{H}=200\ GeV\) also through the fit procedure described above.

These studies indicate that in the framework of a superLHC with an integrated luminosity of \(6000\ fb^{-1}\) the Higgs self-couplings could be measured with a statistical precision of the order of \(15\%\) in the mass range \(150\)-\(200\ GeV\).

Figure 24: Dependence of the cross section for Higgs pair production on the trilinear self-coupling value for different Higgs-boson masses. The cross section and coupling strength are normalised to their nominal SM values.

### Comparison to Linear Collider study

A study of the linear collider potential for the Higgs self-coupling measurement is reported in [15]. The Higgs mass range 120-140 GeV is explored through the process \(e^{+}e^{-}\to HHZ\) with both Higgs-bosons decaying into \(b\bar{b}\). A neural network analysis is applied first and then the cross-section value is extracted from a fit to several kinematic distributions. This study shows that, with \(2000fb^{-1}\), \(\sigma(HH)\) would be measured with a precision of the order of 10-20%, depending on the Higgs mass, and the Higgs self-couplings would be measured with an accuracy of the order of 18-25%. From the study presented in ths note and, in particular, from the numbers shown in table 8, only the superLHC would provide a potential comparable to that of a linear collider for the measurement of the Higgs boson self-coupling.

## 6 Conclusions

In this note the potential for measuring the SM Higgs-boson self-coupling at the LHC was studied through the measurement of the cross section for Higgs-pair production. This is a crucial element in the determination of the Higgs potential in the SM.

This study has shown that in a standard LHC scenario, even considering the full-hedged luminosity potential of ATLAS and CMS combined (\(600fb^{-1}\)) the signal for Higgs-boson pair production is too marginal above the dominant backgrounds \(WWW\) and \(Wt\bar{t}\) to be observed.

In a superLHC scenario, assuming similar detector performance as at lower luminosity and a total integrated luminosity of \(6000fb^{-1}\), Higgs-boson pairs could be observed for Higgs masses between 150 GeV and 200 GeV, with a significance between 4 and 5 \(\sigma\), depending on the Higgs mass. This would lead to a determination of the total production cross section with a statistical uncertainty better than 27% (20%) for \(m_{H}=200\)\(GeV\) (\(m_{H}=170\)\(GeV\)), which corresponds to a determination of the Higgs self-coupling strength with a statistical acuracy of 25% (19%).
