A strategy for tagging muons in the Tile Calorimeter at the second level trigger (LVL2) is presented and its efficiency and contamination are discussed. It is demonstrated that TILECAL can identify muons with good efficiency down to \(p_{T}=2GeV/c\) where the stand-alone muon spectrometer has zero efficiency. A method of exploiting all information available at LVL2 to reduce spurious muon-tag and measure the candidate muon momentum is discussed. The performance of the overal triggering method is tested in particular in the case of \(b\bar{b}\) events at low LHC luminosity (\(10^{33}cm^{-1}s^{-2}\)) with full simulation of experimental conditions.

## 1 Introduction

The main idea for triggering on low \(p_{T}\) muons at the second level trigger is to combine all available information from the whole detector. Low transverse momentum muons in fact can not be safely reconstructed, as we will shortly show below, by the stand-alone muon spectrometer. The identification of muons in the Tile Calorimeter plays an important role in this scheme. The capability of the Tile Calorimeter to identify muons has been previosly assessed by the Tile Collaboration [1], [2],[3],[4]. The aim of this note is to showhow the signature of muons in Tile can be extracted with a fast algorithm [5] and combined with the available information from other sub detectors to construct a trigger.

Here we concentrate on the selection of a di-muon signature, having in mind some interesting B-physics channels whose selection efficiency are strongly enhanced by lowering the \(p_{T}\) threshold of one of the muons. The selection chain starts by requiring, at the first level trigger (LVL1), one low \(p_{T}\) muon in the RPC system (nominally a muon with \(p_{T}\geq 6\) GeV,\(|\eta|\leq 2.4\)). This would give at low luminosity a rate of 23.2 KHz [6]. The largest contribution (about 2/3) comes from muons below the nominal threshold; in fact a LVL-2 confirmation in the muon precision chamber (MDT) would sharpen the threshold and reduce this rate to 9 KHz. The LVL-2 confirmation is performed by a simplified version (\(\mu\)FAST) of the full track reconstruction, fitting the tracks only within a region of interest (RoI) identified by the RPC. The main contributions to the accepted muon rate can be roughly summarized as follows: 5.6 KHz comes from pions and kaons decay 3.4 KHz comes from decay of B-mesons and C-mesons [6].

A further reduction in the rate of muons coming from pions and kaons decay still keeping a good efficiency for prompt muons, is achieved by matching tracks in ID and Muon Spectrometer [7],[8]. We expect a total rate of about 5 KHz after the ID confirmation and matching.

At this point, the Tile Calorimeter starts its search for a second (or more) muon. The algorithm requires that the whole data from the Tile Calorimeter is available at LVL-2 (as allowed in the special case of B-Physics Trigger menu).

This is a very small amount of data when compared to the one of the Inner Detector (such as the TRT, on which is based the B-physics search strategy). We have estimated the total amount of TILECAL data to be transfered and processed, looking at the detector occupancy in \(b\bar{b}\) events+pile-up at low luminosity (all the details are shown in appendix). We estimated that the search of muons in TILECAL at 5 KHz rate require a data transfer bandwidth well within the performance of a commercial PC network card.

Using this algorithm we can open a Secondary Region of interest (SRoI) (one low \(p_{T}\) muon) for other detectors with a good efficiency for muons and a small contamination. As we will see using data from the innermost muon chamber inside this SRoI we can practically reduce all the contamination to zero. Finally in the new SRoI one track search can be performed in the ID, and the muon momentum can be measured with little ambiguity.

## 2 Tile Calorimeter

The Tile calorimeter (TILECAL) [9] is a sampling calorimeter with iron as absorber and scintillating Tiles as active medium. The tiles are placed radially and staggered in depth. The structure is periodic along \(z\). The tiles are 3 mm thick and the total thickness of the iron plates in one period is 14 mm. Two sides of the scintillating tiles are read out by wavelength shifting fibers by two separate photo-multipliers (PMT).

TILECAL is located just outside the Liquid Argon cryostat and inside the muon spectrometer.

It has a cylindrical shape 12.2 m long with outer radius of 4.23 m and inner radius of 2.28 m (Figure 1). It is radially segmented in three layers, approximately 1.4, 4.0 and 1.8 interaction length thick at pseudo rapidity \(\eta\) = 0.

In \(\eta\) the readout cells, built by grouping the readout fibers into PMTs, are pseudo-projective toward the interaction region. Azimuthally TILECAL structure is divided in 64 wedges. All the wedges are alike and their structure is displayed in Figure 1. The resulting granularity is \(\Delta\eta\times\Delta\phi=0.1\times\) 0.1 (\(0.2\times 0.1\) in the last layer). Figure 1 shows that the cylinder is in fact divided in three coaxial cylinders (a Barrel and two Extended Barrels) separated by 68 cm gap needed to accommodate the services of the Liquid Argon Calorimeter and of the Inner Detector. The gap is instrumented, in the space left free, with a intermediat tile calorimeter (ITC) and a simple scintillator-iron slab. In the present study we will consider the full Tile calorimeter geometrical acceptance which is fully simulated in standard ATLAS MonteCarlo packages.

### MonteCarlo and Test beam data Samples

This study is performed using the ATLAS standard simulation package (DICE). In this section, we will briefly discuss the comparison of the muon MC data samples with the real data obtained during the calibration of the calorimeter modules. The agreement between real and simulated data validates our MC data samples and makes us confident on our understanding of the detector response, and on the MC description.

Figure 2 shows the muon energy deposition in the last calorimeter layer (D-cells) as a function of the \(\eta\) coordinate of the generated muon.

Muons are generated with \(p_{T}=8\) GeV/c, uniformly over the \(\eta\) and \(\phi\) range covered by TILECAL. Muon response gives a sort of radiography of the calorimeter's cell structure. If one compares this figure with figure 1, one can identify the D-cells edges at \(\eta=0.1\), \(\eta=0.3\), \(\eta=0.5\) and \(\eta=0.7\), the gap region (instrumented with ITC) which peaks at \(\eta=0.85\) and the cells D-5, D-6 in the extended barrel (these cells are thicker and give a large energy deposit).

For future reference, we stress the large energy spread at \(\eta\leq 0.1\), due to the large sampling ratio variation (iron/scintillator).

Figure 2: _Small points are the MonteCarlo Simulation of the muon energy deposition in the third radial sample of the Tile Calorimeter versus eta. Overlayed (circles) is also shown the average energy deposition in 0.015 eta bin._To make a comparison with the Test Beam data (for which data exist at fixed \(\eta\) value), we have generated samples of muon in a narrow \(\eta\) and \(\phi\) window, taking into account the real dimensions, and geometry of the beam. Figure 3 shows the comparison between the energy deposition in one D-cell computed in the MonteCarlo and the experimental distribution. Data are at \(\eta=0.25\) (left plot) and \(\eta=1.05\) (right plot). To take into account the effect of the electronic noise (see Fig. 4) the MonteCarlo distributions are Gaussian smeared accordingly to the measured electronic noise (r.m.s. of the noise is determined using test beam data).

The agreement between the MC and data distributions is good. This make us confident that the MonteCarlo simulation describes correctly the real performances of TILECAL.

## 3 Description of the algorithm

The muon finding algorithm exploits the full segmentation of the Tile Calorimeter. The energy deposited in each TILECAL depth will be denoted by \(E_{1},\ E_{2}\) and \(E_{3}\). \(E_{1}\) being the energy in the first depth, the nearest to the interaction region, \(E_{3}\) the energy in the outer depth. It is intuitive that, due to the screening effect of the innermost layers, the outer depth contains the clearest muon signature.

Figure 3: _Comparison between Test Beam and MonteCarlo energy deposition distribution, obtained with muons at \(\eta=0.25\) (left plot) and at \(\eta=1.05\) (right plot)._

The algorithm starts with a search for a candidate muon in all the cells of the third layer. A candidate muon is found when the energy deposition in one cell is compatible with that of a muon (i.e. \(thr_{3low}\leq E_{3}\leq thr_{3hi}\)). The thresholds are chosen to cuts the electronic noise on the low side and the tails of hadronic showers on the high side. When a candidate is found the search is continued in the central layer cells following a pattern which point to the interaction region. The pattern search is implemented in the algorithm as a fast look up table which can be easily modified to improve the algorithm efficiency. The search is actually done by looking for cells in the nearby \(\eta\) and in the same \(\phi\) bin. If one of the cells is found with an energy deposition compatible with that of a muon (\(thr_{2low}\leq E_{2}\leq thr_{2hi}\)) the search is then continued also in the first layer cells. If one cell is found with an energy release within the thresholds (\(thr_{1low}\leq E_{1}\leq thr_{1hi}\)) the candidate is confirmed to be a penetrating muon. The (\(\eta,\phi\)) coordinates of the found "track" are calculated as the average coordinates of the cells in the three layers.

The cell structure of the Tile Calorimeter is only approximately projective (see figure1). This is particularly evident, in the extended barrel module. A penetrating muon can cross more than one cell in each layer and its signal is split among two or more nearby eta cells. It is also possible, and MonteCarlo simulation shows it clearly, that muons are split between two nearby \(\phi\) cells, by the bending effect of the magnetic field. Muon splitting in different cells has two main effects: the measured muon energy deposition is lower because it is shared between cells, resulting in a lower efficiency to discriminate it from the electronic noise and it could, eventually, cause some problem of multiple counting. Some studies have been performed with a more complex pattern search [10] to take into account the muon bending, but this and other improvements will be reported in a future note.

The algorithm takes into account the splitting between nearby cells by performing some additional check in the last layer. When two nearby eta candidates are found, a check is performed to determine if the same muon has crossed both cells or there are two different muons. The check is made by summing the energy of the nearby cells and comparing it with the threshold values. In the latter case the energy sum would be too large and incompatible with a single muon. This simple check allows us to avoid almost all the double counting and to obtain a better estimation of the muon energy deposition in the three calorimeter layers.

### The energy thresholds

The electronic noise in the readout chain sets the lower threshold. The good design and compactness of the read-out electronic of the Tile Calorimeter together with its large photo-statistics allows to measure cell energy deposition down to a hundred MeV. Figure 4 shows the contribution of electronic noise to the energy deposition (pedestal) measured during Test Beam calibration of TILECAL. We assume that the experimental conditions will be the same as during the ATLAS data taking. The distribution is described by a Gaussian with an RMS=60 MeV

Note that the probability that uncorrelated electronic noise flags a muon is the product of the probability that noise is above threshold in all the three radial compartments. Setting each threshold to \(+1\sigma\) would give a probability of 0.4% of fake muons due to electronic noise.

However the lower thresholds cuts also the pile-up of minimum bias events. The standard simulation of pile-up in the calorimeter [12] is performed by adding to the calorimeter cell the energy deposited by 2.3, (23.0

Figure 4: _Distribution of electronic noise in one cell of the Tile Calorimeter as measured during August 2001 Test Beam._at high luminosity) average number of minimum bias events for each bunch crossing. The number of events added follows a Poisson distribution, and several bunch crossing are summed up to take into account the possible integration during the time response of the Calorimeter (This is important for the LAr calorimeter, whereas is less important for TILECAL). The events added are then weighted using the typical pulse shape of the calorimeter (for TILECAL, typical pulse extends to 75 ns).

Figure 5(left) shows the distribution of energy deposition due to pure pile-up of minimum bias event at low luminosity (\(10^{33}\,cm^{-1}s^{-2}\)) in the first layer cells of TILECAL. Figure 5(right) shows instead the energy deposit in the cells of last layer. Despite the fact that the two distributions have the same r.m.s. (determined by the content of the first few bins) cells D have very few events with an energy deposit larger than 0.5 GeV due to the screening of the first two layer.

The cell lower threshold in this analysis are fixed to 200 MeV, whereas the variation of this value is analyzed in section 4.2.2.

The higher thresholds cuts to eliminate showers and hadron punch-throughs, must be fixed by considering the maximum muon energy deposition in the cells. We have studied the variation in the energy deposition value due to the different muon path length using single muon event, generated uniformly on the TILECAL range. The cell transverse energy clearly, does not depend too much on eta, and only three thresholds (one for each layer depth) can be used for all cells, neglecting some differences in the cell dimension. A better strategy to reduce the number of fake tags should be based on individual thresholds for each cell. The symmetry reduces the total number

Figure 5: _Energy deposition, in the first (right plot) and in the third (left plot) calorimeter layer due to minimum bias event pile-up at low luminosity._

of thresholds to only 37, 7 in the last layer, and 15 for each of the other. Figure 6 shows the distribution of the muon energy deposition in the cell D6 (the biggest one in the extended barrel module) and in cell D3 of the barrel. The vertical lines shows the threshold interval; the higher value is calculated to accept 99% of the events.

The results described in this note are obtained using this optimal settings for the higher thresholds. It is worth to stress that the efficiency of the algorithm does not depend too strongly on the precise value of the thresholds, whereas the number of fakes (the wrongly tagged muons that we will describe below) can be improved by carefully optimizing the thresholds.

## 4 Algorithm performances

In this section the performances of the algorithm are analyzed by using first single muons and then the fully simulated B-physics events. The main aim is to calculate and study the efficiency to recognize a good muon, and the probability of fake tags due to hadron shower activity and pile-up of minimum bias events.

### Single muon Acceptance

The tagging efficiency (we will refer often to it, as muon acceptance) of the Tile calorimeter is studied using single muon events generated with different \(p_{T}\). The event sample was generated using the DICE package on the range

Figure 6: _Distributions of the simulated energy deposition by muons (generated uniformly) in cell D-6 (left) and in cell D-3 (right). The value of the thresholds are shown as vertical lines. The higher threshold for each cell is calculated to accept \(99\%\) of events._

covered by the calorimeter ( \(0\leq\phi\leq 2\pi\), \(\left|\eta\right|\leq 1.7\)). The geometrical acceptance of the tagging algorithm is limited by the coverage of the third calorimeter layer (i.e. \(\left|\eta\right|\leq 1.4\)). The events are reconstructed using the full detector simulation 1, and then processed with the algorithm. Figure 7 show the average acceptance curve (average on \(p_{T}\) and \(\phi\) coordinate) of the Tile tag algorithm to single muons versus the \(\eta\) coordinate. The acceptance or \(\mu\)-tagging efficiency is defined as the fraction of the muons tagged.

Footnote 1: ATRECON, CVS/SRT version 2.0.2 on CERN Linux machines

We can note the symmetric behavior, with an almost flat region (75% of muons accepted) and some important losses. The losses at small eta are due to the large spread in the muon energy deposition caused by large sampling ratio variation (iron/scintillator). The losses at \(\left|\eta\right|\sim 0.7-1.1\) in the transition region between barrel and extended barrel (see Figure 1) occur where one out of the tree cells is missing, the third layer cells at \(\eta=0.7\) and the first ones at \(\eta=1.1\).

Figure 7: _Acceptance of single muon in the Tile Calorimeter as a function of the \(\eta\) coordinate._

The average acceptance is significantly affected by these losses and a different strategy could be studied to cope with it. Since both the widening of the threshold window or the reduction of the algorithm to the coincidence of only two cells (where one is missing) will lead to an increase in the number of fakes, different approaches should be addressed and studied. Results obtained with a simple modification of our basic algorithm in this regions are described in the section 4.2.2.

Figure 8 shows the muon acceptance versus the \(\phi\) coordinate. As expected the response is flat since in \(\phi\) the calorimeter is very homogeneous and with very small cracks. Figure 9 shows the acceptance as function of the muons \(p_{T}\). The average muon acceptance is about 60%, flat in \(p_{T}\), down to 2 GeV/c. It becomes \(\sim\) 2% at 1 GeV/c where the main contribution comes from muons at large eta (the minimum muon energy to reach the third layer cell from range estimation at \(\eta\) = 0 is 1.8 GeV).

Figure 8: \(\eta\) _averaged acceptance of Tile Calorimeter to single muon versus \(\phi\) coordinate_.

#### 4.1.1 \(\Delta\phi\)\(\Delta\eta\) **Tilecal muon resolution**

The algorithm provides the \(\eta\) and \(\phi\) coordinates of the tagged muon. For later reference we will define these values as \(\eta_{TILE}\) and \(\phi_{TILE}\). These informations are precise enough to define in the detector a secondary region of interest (SRoI) as we will describe below. The values are simply calculated as the average of the \(\eta\) and \(\phi\) coordinates of the crossed cells. An attempt to use averages weighted with the energy deposited, gives no better results.

Figure 10 shows the distribution of residuals between the muon tagged \(\eta_{TILE}\) and the muon generated \(\eta\). The distribution is obtained by considering, as described above, the sample of muons generated in the full range covered by the Tile Calorimeter. The distribution is well described by a Gaussian and the fit gives \(\sigma_{\eta}=0.04\); i.e. 99% of the muons are within a cone of \(\Delta\eta=0.1\) around the \(\eta_{TILE}\).

Figure 9: _Average acceptance of the Tile calorimeter to single muon as a function of the muon \(p_{T}\)._Figure 11: _Distribution of residual between the muon reconstructed \(\phi_{TILE}\) and the muon generated \(\phi\). The bin dimension in figure is 0.1 rad (\(2\pi/64\)) corresponding to the \(\phi\)-granularity of Tile Calorimeter._

Figure 10: _Distribution of residual between the muon reconstructed \(\eta_{TILE}\) and the muon generated \(\eta\)._

Figure 11 shows the distribution of the residuals between the muon tagged \(\phi_{TILE}\) and the muon generated \(\phi\) (the value has been calculated at the entrance radius of the Tile Calorimeter). The RMS of the distribution is \(\sigma_{\phi}=0.06\,\)mrad. Here we can note that the resolution is a bit worst than the previous, because the average on the \(\phi\) coordinates of the cells does not help since the three layers have the same \(\phi\).

### Physics event:\(B^{0}\to J/\psi(\mu,\mu)K^{0}\)

This is one of the physics case that we are considering, for which this algorithm has to be optimized. The complete simulated events 2 are generated using PYTHIA (pp\(\to b\overline{b}\to B_{0}(J\psi)\kern 1.8pt\kern 1.8pt\kern 1.8pt \kern 1.8pt\bar{B}_{0}(\mu)\)), simulated through the detector with GEANT and then reconstructed with ATRECON. The events are reconstructed in the real scenario with the low luminosity detector pile-up added. This sample of data contains muons and jets and it is interesting to check the muon tagging efficiency and the fraction of fake tags induced by the jet activity and pile-up, simulating a realistic data taking in ATLAS. Figure 12 shows the \(p_{T}\) spectrum of the muons in these events.

Footnote 2: tape Y24 574, events generated for the physics TDR studies

The muons spectrum from the decay of \(J/\psi\) is plot in black (the one of the good muonstagged, as we will define below, is plotted with full circles ). Two sharp edges are visible: at 6 GeV/c due to the LVL-1 trigger acceptance request, and at 3 GeV/c due to muon low \(p_{T}\) filtering, both cuts are applied at generation level. The other muons come from the decay of \(\vec{B^{0}}\) and \(K^{0}\) mesons, and few from showering hadron decay.

#### 4.2.1 Efficiency of the algorithm

Figure 13 shows the number of Tile tags as function of the number of muons within the calorimeter acceptance for each event. In this sample we can have as many as 5 muons, in some events. In the case of perfect efficiency (all muon recognized) and no mistag, only the diagonal would be populated. Below the diagonal enter mainly events with some muon lost, whereas above the diagonal enter the events with some fake tags.

To disentangle in a clear way the good tags from the fake tags we can look for a matching between the spatial coordinates \((\eta,\phi)\) of the generated muons and the reconstructed one by the tagging algorithm (\(\eta_{TILE}\),\(\phi_{TILE}\)). Figure 14 shows the distribution of the residuals (\(\eta_{TILE}-\eta\)), whereas figure 15 shows the same distribution for the residuals (\(\phi_{TILE}-\phi\)).

We define the muon tag as good if there is a true muon (in generation) within the cone of acceptance, which we have fixed, as described above, with

Figure 13: _The number of Tile-tags as a function of the number of muon in the event._

single muon events (\(\Delta\eta\,\Delta\phi=0.18\times 0.2\)). Otherwise the tag is considered a fake.

Figure 14: _Distribution of residual between the reconstructed \(\eta_{TILE}\) and the generated \(\eta\) of the muon. Overlayed in black (inset show a magnification) is the same plot for the muons within the defined good acceptance cone \(\Delta\eta\Delta\phi=0.18\times 0.2\) (“good tagged muons ”)._

Figure 15: _Distribution of residual between the reconstructed \(\phi_{TILE}\) and the generated \(\phi\) of the muon. Overlayed in black (inset show a magnification) is the same distribution for the muons within the defined acceptance cone \(\Delta\eta\,\Delta\phi=0.18\times 0.2\) (“good tagged muon”). The x-axis scale is defined as in fig. 11._

We can now separate the different contributions. Figure 16, shows the number of good tags versus the number of generated muons.

Figure 16: _Number of good tagged muons versus number of real muons in events with a \(p_{T}\) greater than 1 GeV/c._

Figure 17: _Number of mistags versus the number of real muons in events with a \(p_{T}\) greater than 1 GeV/c._

Only muons with \(p_{T}\geq 1\) GeV/c are considered. The muon tag efficiency is defined, accordingly with the previous section, as the fraction between the "good tagged muons" and the total number of muons. This is a simple and operative definition, moreover from the figure 16 we can prove that the probability to tag \(n\) muons in the set of \(m\), as expected, is well described by a binomial distribution \(P(n\,|\!\!m\,)={m\choose n}p^{n}\,(1-p)^{m-n}\) with elementary probability (p=0.58) well in agreement with the result we obtain with the simpler definition.

Figure 17 shows the number of fake tags versus the number of generated muons. We count 50 fake tags, on a sample of one thousand \(b\overline{b}\) events plus pileup. The number of fake tags for event is then 5%. The probability to have two fakes scales as the square of the probability of one fake i.e. about \(10^{-3}\), as can be verified directly from the figure 17. Note that this number is not a probability because in principle more than one mistag is possible for one event.

As for single muon events, we calculates the tag efficiency curves. Figure 18 shows the muon tag efficiency as function of the muon \(p_{T}\). The efficiency is about 60% down to 2 GeV/c. This result is in good agreement with what we obtained using the single muon events, demonstrating that our algorithm is robust and not too sensitive to the presence of the underlying particles and jet activity in the event. Figure 19 shows the muon tag efficiency as a function of the muon \(p_{T}\) in events \(b\overline{b}\to J\psi(\mu,\mu)X\,\).

Figure 18: _Muon tagging efficiency as a function of the muon \(p_{T}\) in events \(b\overline{b}\to J\psi(\mu,\mu)X\,\)._

ciency as a function of the pseudo rapidity \(\eta\). Also in this case the agreement with the curve calculated with single muons is good.

The fraction of mistags decreases from 5% to 2% when the events are reconstructed without the pile-up of minimum bias event. We have to note that the fraction of mistags due to the effect of the pileup is in principle overestimated, since the information at particle level is not available in the added minimum bias events, and some of the fakes could in fact be real muons. Such information should be available in the future in the new reconstruction framework Athena.

#### 4.2.2 Possible strategies to increase the Tag Efficiency

In this section we want to show some possibility of tuning of the tagging algorithm efficiency. First of all, we note that the tag efficiency is obviously reduced by the geometrical losses in the gap region. Some of the losses are irrecoverable (around \(\eta=0.7\)), but for the others there are ways to recover. For instance, in the region \(1<\eta<1.1\) we could implement a weaker request; using a path road of two cells instead of three (one is missing). Figure 20 shows a comparison between the tag efficiency calculated using this modified path road and the one calculated as described in the section 3. The Efficiencies are calculated using the same events \(b\overline{b}\) as described before, with

Figure 19: _Muon tagging efficiency as function of pseudo rapidity._

the low luminosity pile-up added. The average efficiency increase from 60% up to 67%.

But, also the fraction of fakes increases with this new strategy. This is illustrated in the figure 21. The total number of fake tags jump from 50 up to 98, resulting in a fraction of fakes for event of about 10%. We could reduce the fraction of fakes since the Barrel Extended-barrel gap is instrumented with scintillators (\(E_{1},E_{2}\), see Figure 1). The gap scintillators could be useful to identify muons even if they are not equivalent to a calorimeter cell. Unfortunately in the present reconstruction code of ATLAS the gap scintillators are not implemented and we cannot establish how much they will reduce the fraction of fakes.

Figure 20: _Muon tag Efficiency versus \(\eta\), are shown for comparison the curves obtained with the two configurations described in the text._

In any case we will show that requiring a coincidence with other detectors (in particular the innermost muon station) the level of fake tags drops to very small values.

The muon tag efficiency can be improved also with a careful choice of the threshold settings. The muon tag efficiency, as well as the fraction of fakes, depends critically on the (lower) threshold settings. An increase of the lower thresholds results in a lower tag efficiency and in a smaller fraction of fake tags, whereas on the other side, by decreasing the thresholds we can have a higher tag efficiency, but also a large fraction of fakes. Figure 22 shows the muon Tag efficiency versus the muon \(p_{T}\) for two different values of the cells lower thresholds.

Figure 21: _Distribution of the \(\eta\) coordinate of fake muons (empty histogram) using the weakly request (see text) in the gap region. Overlayed, for comparison reasons, are also shown the fake obtained in the usual configuration (full histogram)._

The upper curve, (full points) which corresponds to an average efficiency of about 70% and a fraction of fakes of 8%, is obtained with a threshold setting of 155 MeV. The lower curve (empty points) is obtained by fixing the threshold to 235 MeV, which give a fraction of fakes of 4%. In both cases the analysis is performed on \(b\bar{b}\to J/\psi\ K^{0}X\) events with pile-up at low luminosity.

Finally, figure 23 shows, the so called Neyman-Pearson diagram, the muon tag average efficiency versus the fraction of mistags, obtained varying only the lower thresholds, between 65 MeV and 435 MeV. The results have been obtained using the \(b\bar{b}\to J/\psi\ K^{0}X\) data sample with the low luminosity pile-up. As expected the curve is a monotone increasing function of the fraction of mistags. The efficiency can be as high as 85% provided the DAQ can stand the higher rate due to a fraction of 16% of mistags. The curve shows that the algorithm can be easily tuned to accommodate the demands of the experiment.

## 5 Expected rates

### Di-muon production rates

The di-muon expected production rate at LHC is shown in figure 24. The rates are obtained by requiring one muon of at least \(p_{T}(\mu_{1})\geq 6\) GeV/c in the range \(|\eta(\mu_{1})|\leq 2.4\) (i.e. the coverage range of the trigger chamber) as a function of the transverse momentum of the other muon. The contributions due to heavy particle decay, hadron decay, shower muons are shown. The plot is obtained from [6]; we have extrapolated the data down to \(p_{T}=1GeV/c\) and rescaled the rates taking into account the pseudo-rapidity coverage of the TILE calorimeter for the second muon. The Rates of muons from decays of heavy particles b,c are calculated using PYTHIA 5.7; muon rates from hadron decay are calculated using DPMJET II simulation; see [14] for more details.

### Expected muon-tag rates

It is important to compute what will be the total rate of muon tags that TILECAL will produce in the real case of ATLAS-LVL-1 accepted events (at least one \(\mu\) with \(p_{T}\geq 6\) GeV/c). In the calculation we have to consider both the efficiency of our method and its mistag probability. As we described in the previous section, muons accepted by LVL-1 are originated mainly from pion, kaon and B meson decay. We shall verify the performance of our algorithm on this sample of events. We use a sample of QCD events \(b\overline{b}\to\mu\,(6)X\), wich include also the pile-up at low luminosity (this study should be completed

Figure 24: _Expected di-muon production rates at LHC at low luminosity (\(L=10^{33}\) cm\({}^{-1}\) s\({}^{-2}\)). The pseudo-rapidity range of the muons is \(|\eta(\mu_{1})|\leq 2.4\) and \(|\eta(\mu_{2})|\leq 1.4\). Data are obtained from [6]. The individual contributions from the various channels and the total rate curves are shown._

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:26]

the same for the other LVL-1 accepted events (muons from \(\pi/K\,\mathrm{decay}\)). This assumption is reasonable, in fact: we calculated, as a check, the fraction of fake muons starting from fully simulated minimum bias events (one millions produced in the DC1) requiring at least one muon with \(p_{T}\geq 5\) GeV/c (conservativelly) and \(\left|\eta\right|\leq 2.5\). A dedicated note is in preparation on this subject, here we anticipate some results to validate our assumption. The number of events drops to about 180 if we require the presence of a muon as defined above, but these are still sufficient to calculate the fraction of fakes. It is about 1% (with no pileup), we can expect it drops to about \(3-4\%\) with pileup at low luminosity.

The rate of fake tags is calculated as the product of the fraction of fake times the rate of muon trigger. The LVL-1 muon trigger rate is expected to be 23 KHz, reduced to about 5KHz at LVL-2, after the MDT and Inner Detector confirmation and matching.

The rate of good tags is computed by integrating the muon production cross section, folded with the muon efficiency, with respect to the momentum of the second muon.

Figure 26 shows the final results, as a function of the \(\mu\)-tag efficiency. As expected the rate of good tags increases linearly with the tag efficiency while the fake tags has a sharper dependence on tag efficiency larger than 0.7.

The total rates at 60% muon tag efficiency (i.e. with the used default threshold settings) is expected to be 860 Hz, from which about 660 Hz are due to good muons whereas about 200 Hz are fakes. In next sections we will show that a good suppression of fakes is possible by exploiting the information of the Muon Spectrometer.

## 6 Combined performance

So far, we have focused the attention on the performance of the Tile Calorimeter in stand alone mode to tag muons. Of course the Tile Calorimeter, cannot

Figure 26: _The expected muon tag rates as a function of the average muon tag efficiency, contribution due to fakes and good tags are shown. Fake rates are calculated considering a LVL-2 muon trigger rate of 5 KHz (see text)._

be used in a stand alone configuration to built a trigger, simply because it does not provide any information on the muon momentum. Such information can be obtained either by the Inner detector, or by the Muon Spectrometer if the muon crosses at least the second station. In this section we concentrate on the study of the combined performances of TILECAL with these sub detectors. We use the reconstructed information (tracks) as available in the CBNT ntuples. This strategy will work at the Event Filter level or off-line.

With some optimism we will assume that some of the information that each sub detector can provide is in fact available at LV L2. In this case we will exploit them to reduce the number of fakes (Muon Detector) and to have a measurement of the muon transverse momentum (Inner Detector). This should be realistic at least for muons in a ROI where the individual sub detectors have informed to process their data.

It can happen (and this is really the important contribution of TILECAL) that a muon is found which was not detected by the LV L1 trigger. We will assume that a secondary ROI can then be opened and consequently data are processed by other sub-detectors so that we can proceed to exploit the detectors information, as we describe below.

### Muon spectrometer

Even if the Muon reconstruction is fully efficient only for muon with a momentum larger than \(6\;GeV/c\), larger than TILECAL threshold, it is anyway useful to look at the information provided by the innermost chamber stations. The innermost stations, in the barrel region, are built with several layers (4+4) of Monitored Drift Tubes (MDT). They are located just outside the Tile Calorimeter. There are two different layout of muon chambers, the large sector mounted between the innermost side of the coils and the small one mounted in front of the coils, at a smaller radius, with some geometrical overlap between the large and the small chamber. The chambers provide a track segment in a region free of the magnetic field. It should be both easy and fast for the spectrometer reconstruction software to build the track segment [15]. We will prove that the combination of the Tile Calorimeter tagging information with a track segment in the muon station will reduce the rate of fake tags and improve also the resolution \(\Delta\phi\Delta\eta\) of the muon track candidate.

We have studied the muon system acceptance, with particular interest for the innermost station, using single muon and B-physic events.

Figure 27 shows the efficiency to reconstruct a muon as function of the muon \(p_{T}\), using our TileCal tag algorithm and the Muon Spectrometer reconstruction (MUON BOX) both for full track reconstruction and for a track segment from the innermost station. Efficiencies are calculated using the events (as before) with \(J/\psi\) decaying into two muons, in the range \(|\eta|<1.4\). We can see that for muons with \(p_{T}\) smaller than 6 GeV/c the full reconstruction (which includes track fitting) becomes quickly inefficient, whereas down to 3 GeV/c the first Muon Station can still built a track segment with about 60% efficiency. The reconstruction efficiency of track segments in the innermost station depends on some fine settings in the segment builder, and it seems to be possible [15] to increase the efficiency lowering the thresholds for the segment builder at least in a small (seeded) region of interest. This should be studied extensively, in the trigger simulation framework by a joint effort of Muon and Tile experts. In any case from Figure 27, we can see that the information from the Tile Calorimeter can be used to confirm the innermost station (and vice versa), with a combined efficiency curve given

Figure 27: _Comparison between the TILECAL muon tag efficiency, the muon spectrometer track reconstruction efficiency and the segment track reconstruction in the innermost station._

by product of the two curves.

The \(\eta-phi\) matching between the Tile Calorimeter and the first Muon Station has been studied using single muon events, of different \(p_{T}\). Figure 28 shows for 3 GeV/c muons the matching between the coordinates \((\phi_{TILE},\eta_{TILE})\) of the Tile Tags and that of the reconstructed segment in the innermost muon station.

The distribution of residual between the \(\eta\) coordinates is dominated by TILECAL resolution and gives an RMS=0.05. The situation is different for the \(\phi\) resolution because the innermost chambers can provides only the \(\phi\) coordinate of the whole sector, whose bin is 0.2 rad (the maximum deviation we see in the distribution). The \(\phi\) resolution of the innermost station is better if the muon crosses two sectors in the regions of the geometrical overlap. The combined \(\phi\) resolution should be thus improved by the Tile Calorimeter. We define the matching between the TILE-tag and the track segment in the innermost muon station considering a \(3\sigma\) cone i.e. \(\Delta\eta\times\Delta\phi=0.18\times 0.3\).

Now we can study the combined "TILECAL + Innermost Station" tag efficiency and fraction of fakes, using as above, the fully simulated B-physics events. Figure 29 shows the residuals in the matching between the Tile calorimeter coordinates \((\eta_{TILE},\phi_{TILE})\) and the corresponding ones in the innermost Muon Station.

Figure 28: _Residual between the TILE tagged muons and the track segments in the innermost muon station for single muons with \(p_{T}=3GeV/c\)._

We can clearly see, above the combinatorial background, the large peaks due to the correct match and (in the \(\Delta\phi\) distribution) the two small peaks at \(\left|\Delta\phi\right|=\pi,\) due to an approximately back to back emission of the B-meson pairs. The full histograms shows the fraction of the TILE-tags matched.

The fraction of fake tags in the combined analysis is \(R_{fake}=0.3\%.\) The muon efficiency (full TILECAL \(\eta\) range) on this sample results to be \(51\%.\)

In order to improve the \(\mu\)-tag efficiency we try to weaken the TILECAL tag parameters. We have considered the following scenario.

1. lower the threshold from 215 MeV to 155 MeV on all the TILECAL compartments. The probability of fake tag due to fluctuation in the electronic noise can be neglected.
2. use in the gap region (between the barrel and extended barrel) the strategy discussed above to cope with the missing layer 1 or layer 3 of TILECAL.

This would increase the overall rate of TILECAL tags because of the larger efficiency for true muons and mainly because of the larger probability of fake tags. However the overall LVL2 rate will not change, if the match with the first muon station is required. This has been studied with the \(b\overline{b}\) sample and the results shows that the muon efficiency could be increased to \(60\%,\) still keeping the fraction of fake muons to \(0.4\%\) Figure 30 summarizes these

Figure 29: _Residual between the TILE tagged muons and the track segments in the innermost muon station, using the events with \(B_{0}\to J/\psi\,(\mu,\mu)\,K^{0}\) plus pile-up, for the \(\eta\) and \(\phi\) coordinates.

results, it shows the muon tag efficiency versus the muon \(p_{T}\) for the stand alone Tile Calorimeter (stars), for the combined systems Tile and innermost station in the two different configurations: the usual thresholds settings (full circles), the lower thresholds and the modified road path search (full squares). Note that the combined efficiency curve now decreases to zero below 3 GeV/c due to the muon innermost stations contribution. The combined efficiency could be tuned also varying some thresholds in the innermost station segment builder and also this should by studied extensively in the future, in the trigger simulation framework.

It is interesting to study the rates of muon tags after the confirmation in the muon innermost chamber. The rates are calculated as described in section 5.2. Figure 31 shows the final results as a function of the TILECAL+Muon Station combined efficiency. Comparing figure 31 with figure 26 (note that the acceptance \(p_{T}\) threshold is different in the two cases) we can see, that the total rate is strongly reduced due to the higher \(p_{T}\) acceptance,

Figure 30: _Muon tag efficiency, in the stand alone TILECAL, and in the combined configuration (TILECAL+Muon station) with two different tagging strategies._

and that the mistag rate is suppressed still keeping a good efficiency.

### Inner detector

The Tile Calorimeter muon tag can be used to open a new Secondary Region of Interest (SRoI), in addition to the ROI of the LV L-1 muon. This new SRoI can be used to seed the muon track search in the Inner Detector. This search is less time and resources consuming, with respect to a full scan of one of the inner detectors. The efficiency of the whole chain should be implemented and studied in a more appropriate Trigger Simulation Framework, and this should be done in the future as soon as such a Framework is available. In this section we only perform an off-line-like analysis looking at the ID tracks within the TILE SRoIs. We use single muons event to study the matching between the Tile Tag, and the tracks at the exit radius of the Inner Detector

Figure 31: _The expected rates after the Innermost Station confirmation of the TILECAL tags as a function of the combined efficiency; Results are obtained varying the TILECAL low thresholds at a fixed muon chamber efficiency (see text)._

(1.05 m). Low \(p_{T}\) muons are bent in \(\phi\) direction depending on the charge and momentum before they reach the Tile Calorimeter. This increases the angular dimension of the ID region in which the muon is expected to be found and which have to be processed. Figure 32 shows the matching between the \(\phi\) coordinates of the Tile muon-tag and the track at the inner detector exit. The distributions are obtained for negative single muon with \(p_{T}=2,4,6\ GeV/c\). As expected, the distribution of residuals shifts with \(p_{T}\), keeping the same width (which is determined mainly by the Tile Calorimeter granularity ) and the lower \(p_{T}\) muons defines the dimension of the RoI in the ID. Considering a \(3\sigma\) cut in the distribution of 2 GeV/c muon we obtained for the RoI the overall dimension \(\Delta\phi=2\times 0.36\ rad\).

Figure 33 shows the matching between the eta coordinates, the distribution is fitted by a Gaussian. Since there is no bending in eta, the sigma of the distribution is well in agreement with the eta resolution of the TILE calculated in the section 5.1.1. Considering a \(3\sigma\) window we can conclude

Figure 32: _Distributions of residual between \(\phi_{Tile}\) and \(\phi_{I\,D}\) at the exit radius of the inner detector obtained using negative single muon events of different \(p_{T}\)._

that the overall dimension of the S RoI to be searched in the ID for muons of \(p_{T}\) as low as 2 GeV/c is \(\Delta\phi\times\Delta\eta=0.72\times 0.22\). This angular interval is less than 1% of the total ID coverage in the range \(|\eta|\leq 1.4\).

Now we can look at the matching using the \(B^{0}\to J\psi\left(\mu\mu\right)K^{0}\) data sample; with the minimum bias pile-up in the Calorimeter. Figure 34 (Figure 35) shows the distribution of residuals between the \(\phi\) (\(\eta\)) coordinates of all the tracks at the exit radius of the inner detector with \(p_{T}\geq 2GeV/c\), and the \(\phi_{TILE}\) (\(\eta_{TILE}\)) coordinates.

Figure 35: _Residuals between the \(\eta_{Tile}\) coordinate and the \(\eta\) coordinate at the ID exit radius of reconstructed tracks with \(p_{T}\geq\) 2GeV/\(c\)._

We can see the large peak due to the good match of the Tile-tags with tracks in the Inner detector. The inset show the scatter plot between the TILECAL and the ID coordinate, showing that a good correlation exist (i.e. muon is found, and momentum can be measured).

It is interesting to study the number of ID tracks inside the SRoI defined by the Tile Calorimeter. Figure 36 shows the distribution of the number of ID tracks with \(p_{T}\geq 2GeV\) (continuum histogram), and for the tracks with \(p_{T}\geq 0.5GeV\) (hatched histogram).

The distributions have a long tail, but we can note that considering all the tracks (\(p_{T}>0.5\)GeV/c), in about 60% of cases we have only one tracks. This indicate (qualitatively) that the ID data processing in the SRoI, should be fast.

If we apply a cut on the tracks transverse momentum (in fact the muon tagged by TILE should have at least \(p_{T}\geq 2GeV\)) 73% of the muon tags have only one ID tracks in the defined RoI (i.e. no ambiguity in the momentum

Figure 36: _Number of ID tracks inside the SRoI (overall dimension \(\Delta\phi\times\Delta\eta\) = 0.72\(\times\) 0.22) defined by the Tile Calorimeter in events \(B^{0}\to J\psi(\mu\mu)K^{0}\). All tracks is referred to tracks with \(p_{T}\geq\) 0.5\(GeV\)._

measurement) This result on track multiplicity is however underestimated to some extent because in this data sample the pile-up in the inner detector is not simulated, it is available only for stand alone ID study. We checked the results using ID stand alone data (\(b\overline{b}\rightarrow\mu X\) + pile-up). The number of tracks with \(p_{T}\geq 2GeV\) inside an angular region as the TILE SRoI (around a true muon) turn out to be in average 1.20 with an RMS=0.7 This is shown in the figure 37

We can see also in this case that the fraction of events with only one track is large.

To conclude this section, figure 38 shows the invariant mass distribution of all the opposite sign tracks in the defined SRoIs. This has been obtained accepting the events with a TILE double \(\mu\)-tag, (this is not the most efficient way, because we are also confirming with Tile the LV L1 muon). We use the ID tracks parameters as calculated at the exit radius of the ID.

Figure 37: _Number of ID tracks inside the SRoI (overall dimension \(\Delta\phi\times\Delta\eta=0.72\times 0.22\)) defined by the Tile Calorimeter in events \(b\overline{b}\rightarrow\mu X\) +low luminosity pileup. All tracks means tracks with \(p_{T}\geq 0.5\ GeV\)._

We can see very well above the background due to possible combinatorics the \(J/\psi\) mass peak.

The efficiency to select a \(J/\psi\) with the method exploited in this note 1 \(\mu(p_{T}\geq 6\ GeV/c)\) and 1 \(\mu(p\!t\geq 2\ GeV/c))\) using a conservative threshold settings is estimated to be (47%) a factor 2.35 higher than the fraction (20%) of \(J/\psi\to\mu\mu\) with both muons above a sharply threshold of 6 GeV/c in the same range.

## 7 Concluding remarks

We propose an algorithm for soft muons tagging in the Tile Calorimeter. The performance of this methods has been studied using single muon events of different \(p_{T}\) and fully simulated B event samples:

* \(b\overline{b}\to\mu X\,+\) pile-up
* \(b\overline{b}\to J/\psi(\mu,\mu)K^{0}X\,+\) pile-up

Figure 38: _Invariant mass distribution for all the opposite charge tracks in the ID SRoIs determined by the TILE \(\mu\)-tag algorithm_.

All the results obtained are fully consistent.

The TILECAL \(\mu\)-tagging efficiency and the corresponding fraction of fake tags depends on the fine threshold setting. Fixing a conservative threshold setting, the average muon tag efficiency on the whole TILECAL coverage \(|\eta|\leq 1.4\) (this include also gap region) results 60% with 5% fraction of fake tags.

This algorithm can be used to define at LVL-2 (after the Muon spectrometer and ID confirmation of an accepted LVL-1 muon) a new SRoI containing a muon of low \(p_{T}\) (as low as 2 GeV/c). The total rates of muon tags at LVL-2 is expected to be 860 Hz, where 660 Hz are due to true muons and about 200 Hz are fakes.

Always at LVL-2 using data in this SRoI, the Tile Tags can be purified from fakes (from 5% to 0.1% with still 51% efficiency) looking for a coincidence with a track segment (eventually seeding its reconstruction) in the innermost station of the Muon Spectrometer. The combined TILECAL+Muon Spectrometer efficiency should be improved by a careful choice of the thresholds in the Muon Chambers; this should be studied in the future. The expected muon tag rates after the coincidence (that increased the \(p_{T}\) acceptance threshold to about 3 GeV/c) is 280 Hz with a contribution from mistags of the order of 7 Hz.

Then in the defined SRoI a track search in the Inner Detector could be easily performed. The ID track search can be limited to a region \(\Delta\eta\times\Delta\phi=0.22\times 0.72\), (constrained with \(p_{T}\geq 2GeV/c\)). The average track multiplicity in this SRoI calculated using realistic data sample (with minimum bias pile-up) is 1.20. In 73% of the cases the SRoI contain only one track. This indicate (qualitatively) that the track reconstruction should be fast and that the muon momentum can be measured practically without ambiguity.

Although the obvious motivation of this study was to enhance at the trigger level the selection of interesting B-physics samples lowering the muon \(p_{T}\) acceptance (a factor greater than 2.3 for the \(J/\psi\)), the methods studied can be used to enhance the muon identification also in a wider context. In this spirit we test the Tile tag performance also at high luminosity. Some results are reported in appendix 8.1.

## 8 Appendices

### Performance at \(L=10^{34}\)\(cm^{-1}\)\(s^{-2}\)

We use the \(J/\psi\) data sample with the minimum bias pile-up at high luminosity to tests the algorithm. The muon tag efficiency (60% with the settingswe discuss above) is not affected from the presence of the pile-ups even at high luminosity. On the contrary the number of fake tags clearly increases. Figure 39 shows the distribution of the eta coordinate of the fake tags.

The fraction of fakes per event is 28%, to be compared with 5% at low luminosity. We can see that the fake muons occur mainly in the extended barrel region, where we expect more minimum bias events and also the performance of the algorithm are inferior due to the bigger cell dimension and the worse projective structure. Considering only the barrel part of the calorimeter (\(|\eta|\leq 0.7\)) the fraction of fakes reduces to only 5.3% (it was 1.7% at low luminosity) with an average muon tag efficiency that is better than before due to the good coverage of the barrel (see Figure 19).

Taking this number seriously and neglecting for the moment all other issues such as rates, and more unknowns we can conclude that the performance of this muon tagging algorithm at high luminosity are interesting enough to deserve more investigations.

Figure 39: _Distribution of the eta coordinate of fake tags obtained with the \(J/\psi\) data sample reconstructed at high luminosity._

### Data Bandwidth estimation

The required bandwidth for the transfer of Tile Data from the Read Out Buffers to the LV L-2 Processing Units can be estimated by taking into account the detector occupancy, the expected muon search rate and the size of the event fragment at the level of the ROB. Figure 40 (left) shows the average number of Tile cell with an energy deposition above a fixed threshold as a function of this threshold.

Results are obtained using the \(J/\!\psi\) data sample reconstructed with minimum bias pile-up either at low and high luminosity. The electronic noise is not included in this results, but the effect of occupancy due to the noise (as it is measured in the TILECAL test beam) can be estimated with simple considerations. Moreover we will consider that the zero suppression will be applied in ordinary runs. A methodology for zero suppression has been studied at the level of the Read Out Driver [16] in the Tile Test Beam, showing good reduction of pedestal events (98%) while still preserving 99% of real (muon) events. figure 40 (left) also shows for comparison (vertical line) the typical RMS of the electronic noise in one TILECAL cell. Here we concentrated in the occupancy due to physics and pile-up. The number of "interesting" cells, as expected, decreases when the threshold increases. If we fix a threshold for zero suppression twice the RMS value of the electronic noise we should

Figure 40: _(Left plot) Distribution of the average number of Tile cells above a threshold as a function of the threshold value in events \(b\overline{b}\to J/\psi(\mu,\mu)\,K^{0}+X(\mu)\) plus pile-up at low and high luminosity, the vertical line represent the RMS (65 MeV) of the expected electronic noise distribution in one TILECAL cell. (Right plot) shows the distribution of the number of cells above 65 MeV._have about 100 cells (2.2%) above threshold due to noise fluctuation and of order to 30 cells (at low luminosity) with data above threshold for a real energy deposition. Also considering the high luminosity scenario, the average detector occupancy remains below the 6%.

The structure of the TILE event is not fully defined but there are some proposals. Accordingly with these, we will assume that the energy of each cell is defined as one 32 bit word. In the event fragment there are also other words (header/trailer needed for the cell mapping) but we will neglect it. If the search of muons in TILE is performed at 5 KHz rate, with an average occupancy corresponding to 200 cells, we can argue that the data bandwidth needed is of order to 32 Mbit/s. This is a very modest value; for comparison, commercially available PC network card have a data bandwidth of 100 Mbit/s. We can conclude that the data bandwidth required for the identification of muons in TILE is not a big issue also considering \(b\overline{b}\) events at high luminosity.
