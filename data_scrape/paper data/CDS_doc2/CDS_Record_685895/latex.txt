Introduction

In a recent RD-6 Note [1] a 36 KeV narrow monochromatic X-ray beam was proposed for measurements of the positions of wires and walls of straw proportional tubes. The tests have been done with one short straw tube, placed closely to the exit slit of the monochromator. Here we describe results of the tests carried out with the Transition Radiation Tracker cell prototype placed at various distances from the monochromator to imitate geometry in ATLAS TRT.

## 2 Experimental Set-up

### X-ray apparatus

A simple test-bench constructed for measurements is shown schematically in Fig. 1 (side and top views). An X-ray tube with a silicon crystal monochromator (1) was mounted on a steel channel beam (2). Three point adjustable support and a digital indicator (3) allowed to rotate the X-ray beam around the horizontal axis to make it parallel to the straw wires in the cell prototype. The cell (4) has been installed on a carriage of a table (5) moveable across the X-ray beam with a screw under control of the second digital indicator. To avoid a lost motion of the carriage, it was tightened by a hung load of several kilogram weight.

The moveable table with the cell could be mounted on the steel beam at three positions: 0.3 m, 1.3 m, and 2.3 m from the monochromator exit slit. A sodium iodide detector placed behind the cell in the first position could be used to measure the X-ray beam intensity. We have used a low power (up to 5 W) sharp focus X-ray tube REIS, manufactured in St.-Petersburg. The silicon crystal monochromator was made in PNPI. In the Fig. 2 a sketch of the X-ray tube and the monochromator is shown. Electron beam (2) was focused by electrostatic (3) and magnetic lenses (4) onto a spot of about 40-50 \(\mu m\) in diameter. A thin praseodymium (5) layer deposited on the inner surface of the beryllium exit window (6) served as a target. The energy spectrum of uncollimated X-ray radiation is shown in Fig. 3a. The X-ray beam selected by a tungsten slit (7) of 300 \(\mu m\) width was incident on the silicon crystal (8). The X-ray quanta with the wave length meeting the Bragg condition were diffracted on the silicon crystal planes (111 planes) and passed through an exit slit (11) made of tungsten cylinders (see for details Fig. 4 and Fig. 5). The exit slit was adjustable in width and could be turned around the X-ray beam axis. The crystal was clamped in a crystal shaft slot by a spring via a slide block (9) serving as a jaw of the second collimating slit. The second jaw of this collimating slit (10) was placed after the crystal to intercept the direct X-ray beam. The crystal shaft could be rotated by a screw via a lever under a control of a dial indicator to turn crystal into the Bragg position. The exit slit was fastened on a slit lever at a distance 190 mm from the crystal shaft axis. The exit slit by rotating around the crystal shaft axis had to be put in position corresponding to the double Bragg angle. The rotation was monitored by the second dial indicator. The energy spectrum after the monochromator is shown in Fig. 3b.

Parameters of the X-ray beam during the measurements were as follows:

- Energy 36.03 KeV (\(K_{\alpha 1}\)Pr);

- Intensity \(\sim 2000\ 1/sec\);

- width at the exit slit 50 \(\mu m\);

- height at the exit slit 22 \(mm\);

- horizontal divergence \(\pm\) 55 \(\mu\)rad;

- vertical divergence \(\pm\) 42 mrad;

- X-ray tube current 19 \(\mu A\);

- X-ray tube voltage 95 \(kV\);

### One-cell prototype

One cell prototype is a 1/75 part of a full-scale endcap TRT module. It consist of 128 straws. The straws have a length of 500 mm and a diameter of 4 mm. The geometry of the straws position is shown in Fig. 6. The straws were reinforced by carbon-fibers to avoid influence of humidity and temperature on the properties of the detector. The proportional straw tubes are prepared from a kapton film containing a conductive layer (\(1000A^{0}\) - Al + 4 \(\mu\)m carbon-loaded kapton). The straw wall thickness was about 60 \(\mu\)m. The diameter of the wire made of copper-beryllium bronze was 50 \(\mu\)m. The straws were operated with a 80% \(Ar\) + 20% \(CH_{4}\) gas mixture at a gas gain of \(10^{4}\). The electronics used for this test consisted of preamplifiers mounted near the ends of the straws, shaping amplifiers (\(\tau\simeq 100\) ns), and ADCs (Le Croy mod. 2259A). The hight-pulse spectrum from straw for \(Fe^{55}\) source is shown in Fig. 7.

## 3 The adjustment and measurement procedure

In the first run the cell with the moveable table was attached at 0.3 m from the exit slit. Step-by-step movement of the cell was used to irradiate gradually all tubes in the two adjacent rows (see Fig. 8). Before the final measurements, an adjustment around the horizontal axis was done, so that the averaged center-of-gravity positions of the wires measured with the upper half slits opened coincided within 4 \(\mu m\) with those measured with the lower half slits opened (see Table 1). The cell with the moveable table was turned around the vertical axis in the way that the X-ray beam crossed all the wires in the row. Figs. 9 to 16 present the results of the measurements with 20 sec exposition time for all 16 straws. One can see relatively sharp increase of the counting rate when the X-ray beam starts to irradiate the tube wall. The boarder peaks are less prominent compared to the observed ones in [1]. We supposed this is due to additional carbon filament glued to the tubes. The influence of this filament is seen in Fig. 10 as a bump on the curve. Prominent peaks clearly seen on the curves correspond to the wires. Besides the main peaks, week peaks ("ghosts") corresponding in position to the neighboring wirescan be seen. These small peaks can not be produced by photoelectrons, as they have too short range (\(\sim 30\mu m\) in the tube wall material) to penetrate through two tube walls. It was supposed that these peaks were produced by the copper \(K_{a,\beta}\) X-rays. Indeed, in an amplitude spectrum measured when the straw wire was irradiated by the beam one can see a distinct peak corresponding to 8 keV energy (see Fig. 17). A peak of the same energy was measured simultaneously in an adjacent tube (Fig. 18). These peaks vanished, when the wire was shifted from the X-ray beam (Fig. 19, 20). By this way several effects contribute to the measured straw profiles. These contributions are shown schematically in Fig. 21. Relative influence of these effects is dependent strongly on the X-ray beam energy, on wire and tube construction materials, and on a gas mixture chosen. Additional "shadow" effect should be produced by straw wires placed exactly in front of the straw to be investigated. To check the influence of this effect we put the tube row as parallel as possible to the X-ray beam line. The straw profiles in the row with odd numbers were measured simultaneously. The measurement of the row with even numbers were continued 12 hours later. In Figs. 22-37 the profiles are shown in a different scale to see more details. At first sight, there are no visible profile distortions due to absorption of the X-ray beam in the wires. To estimate the absorption in the wires and in the tubes the sodium iodide scintillation spectrometer was put behind the straw cell. The results of these measurements are shown in Figs. 38-41. The deepest point in the absorption curve in Fig. 38 corresponding to the absorption of 31% was produced by three wires, as will be shown later, so one wire produced 12.4% absorption of the beam. Eight straw tubes absorbed 3.2% of the beam.

The wire positions were determined by fitting procedure with a parameterization of a gaussian form with a linear background.

The results are presented in Table 2. The counting rates displayed in the second and in the third columns for the wires and for the tube walls plus gas decrease gradually to the ends of the rows due to the "shadow" effect. One can see as well some random variation caused by different discriminator thresholds set individually to avoid integration pick-up noise from the X-ray HV source. The counting rate have to be corrected by about 10% to take into account the dead time. In the run with the scintillation spectrometer this correction factor was about 1.5. A registration efficiency of the signals from the wire was measured with the single straw number 16. The counting rate at the peak maximum was 30.4 \(1/sec\). The beam intensity was measured to be \(\sim 2000\)\(1/sec\). The registration efficiency corresponding to the interactions with the wire was \(1.5\cdot 10^{-2}\) in agreement with the results of [1]. In the fourth column the wire positions are presented for both straw rows. Standard deviations (in \(\mu m\)) as a result of fitting procedure are shown in the fifth column. These standard deviations include besides statistical errors the nonstability in the X-ray beam intensity and imperfections of the straw performance during the profile measurement, the wire profile distortion due to shadow from the previous wires and the imperfection of the fitting approximation. Being below one micron (mean square standard deviation equals to 0.67 \(\mu m\)) these errors are unessential for wire position determination. In Table 2 the measured FWHM of the wire profiles are presented. Average value of the FWHM (62.3 \(\mu m\)) is close to the slit width meaning that the X-ray beam intensity distribution is close to a rectangular form. Small variations of FWHM for the most down stream wires are supposed to be due to the "shadow" effect from the previous wires. The last part of Table 2 presents the results of the second run. The run was carried out 2 hours later for one straw row. As it was mentioned above 12 hours time difference was between the odd and the even rows measurements. As a result of some temperature difference absolute values of distances between the rows were not reliable. The results of the wire position measurements are shown graphically in Fig. 42. The numbers below show the measurement sequence. The measuremnts 1 and 2 were done with half opened exit slit. Between the first, the second, and the third runs 0.5 hour passed. Comparison of the wire positions measured in 1,2 and 4,5 runs shows reasonably good short-term reproducibility in position. All but one measured wire position differences do not surpass 10 \(\mu m\). Calculated standart deviation \(\sigma_{\it{repr}}\) equals 5.5 \(\mu m\) for all 16 pairs. There is some correlation between measured wire position eccentricity and the SPT (straw proportional tube) energy resolution. One can compare the energy spectrum of SPT # 10 with measured eccentricity of about 400 \(\mu m\), shown in Fig. 43, with one, shown in Fig. 7 for SPT # 2. We had no intention during the first runs to carry out precise measurements of the straw tube and wire position in the cell. Also the room air-conditioning was absent. As a result only measurements of the straws in a row is reliable but not absolute values of the distance between the rows. Nevertheless some conclusions on the cell manufacturing precision can be done. RMS deviation of the wire position averaged over all the 16 straws equals to \(\sigma_{16}=40\mu m\) and \(\sigma_{16-1}=33\mu m\) if to exclude the straw number 12.

A tentative run at the distance 2.3 m has been done as well without any alignment. The measured profile is shown in Fig. 44.

## 4 Discussion

The experimental results described above have demonstrated good perspective to use the existing X-ray tube with the monochromator for one section ("wheel"). test and calibration. The X-ray apparatus has to be installed on a coordinate measuring machine (see Fig. 45). One coordinate -- angle around a wheel axis -- should be measured in 0\({}^{\circ}\) -- 360\({}^{\circ}\) range with precision of 1-2 arcsec to obtain wire position determination with an accuracy of 5-10 \(\mu m\). To measure the angle an incremental angle encoder can be used. The second coordinate to be measured is a radius at which the X-ray beam is placed. The measuring range has to be 0 - 1300 mm. The coordinate difference between several positions of the X-ray beam along a wire has to be measured with a precision of 20 \(\mu m\).

To obtain statistical error below 10 \(\mu m\), the exposure time has to be 0.5-1.0 sec per point. If each wire profile in the wheel contains 15 points and the measurements should be done at three radius positions, it will take 240 hours for all 9600 straws. Under these conditions a long-term stability is important. There are several ways to reduce the calibration time. One way is to optimize the X-ray energy, because the choice of \(K_{\rm{a1}}\)Pr was connected with a cathode strip chamber alignment [2], and this energy might not be optimal. A factor 2 increasing in intensity can be found in optimizing the Pr anticathode thickness (some tubes have intensity of about 4000 per sec.). But the most radical way is to use a higher power X-ray tube with a linear focus, a prototype of which is under tests now at PNPI.

## 5 Conclusions

As it was demonsrated that a high accuracy in measurements of the wire position in space is attainable (down to several microns, if necessary) using the proposed X-ray technics. The wire position relative to the tube wall is also possible to measure. It was shown that the precision measurement is possible even if the wire projections overlap each other. This is important for the mutual alignment of several "wheels" in the end-cap.

To start the first calibration of the wheel prototype, the existing X-ray apparatus seems to be adequate but the precision coordinate measuring machine should be provided with the goal to diminish the calibration time. The optimization of the X-ray energy and continuation of the work with the high power X-ray tube are desirable.
