Report and Recommendation of the ATLAS Muon Review Panel. The Tracking System

The Independent Members of The Muon Review Panel

###### Abstract

A recommendation for the tracking system of the ATLAS muon spectrometer is presented.

## 1 Introduction

Following the general lines of the decision making procedure on sub-detectors, the ATLAS collaboration has set up a Muon Review Panel with the task to formulate recommendations concerning the following questions:

* Which high precision chamber option should become the baseline design of the muon spectrometer
* Which chamber technology should be used for level 1 trigger
* Which technology should be employed at small forward angle

This report deals only with the first question. In section 2 their operating features and potentialities are discussed. In section 3 the performance of the three tracking options are compared. Section 4 deals with mass production aspects and finally, in section 5, the conclusions and the recommendation under the responsibility of the five independent members are presented.

### The Panel

The Panel is composed of the two spokesmen F. Dydak and P. Jenni (ex-officio); W. Blum, C. Fabjan, and H. van der Graaf (experts for tracking chambers); G. Mikenberg and R. Santonico (experts for trigger chambers); B. Aubert (chairman), G. Battistoni, B. Dolgoshein, C. Guyot and W. Witzeling (independent members). The Panel met 11 times between May and December 1993. All information and debates in the Panel have been reported at the Muon working group and at the full collaboration meeting.

### The Schedule for the Recommendation

The request to the Panel was to produce a recommendation by November 1993. However, this date would have prevented the Panel both from considering the results from the latest beam tests and to have a feed back from the collaboration after the presentations in the November ATLAS week. Due to the time needed for the task on the tracking system, recommendations on trigger chambers and on the small angle forward part have been postponed to early 1994.

### The Three Options for Tracking

All the three options are described in detail in recent papers to be quoted in the following. Let us remind here just the crucial characteristics.

* High Pressure Drift Tubes (HPDT). This option is based on the use of cylindrical tubes of extruded Aluminum filled with gas at high pressure to achieve a high resolution. They are fully described in ref. [1]. A sketch of the proposed set-up is given in fig. 1 The HPDT group is proposing for each superlayer a "mattress" structure, where two 3-tube layers are separated by an Aluminum support sandwich, in order to achieve a good angular resolution thus improving pattern recognition. The structure of an individual mattress is considered as stiff and an alignment system is required to measure the position of the layers with respect to each other within a tower thereby obtaining the knowledge on the wire position. The basic scheme of an alignment system using projective laser light rays is shown in fig. 3
* Honeycomb Strip Chambers (HSC). They are described in ref. [2]. They consist (fig. 4) of a stack of hexagonal drift tubes obtained from folded foil (Aluminium or copper cladded mylar). The wire position is defined by an injection molded comb. The structure is not considered as stiff but as "floppy": The chambers are allowed to bend, but the postion of the wires is monitored by means of an alignment system measuring the deformation of the chambers. A solution for second coordinate measurement can be included by using the cathode strip readout.
* Jet Cell Chambers (JCC). This design is the most widely used technology. The proposal for ATLAS is fully described in ref. [3]. A conceptual design is given in fig. 5 Drift cells are built with 6 or 8 sense wires on both sides of a central membrane forming so-called bi-cells which are closed with suitably bent sheets of Aluminium. The bi-cells are mounted, by means of precision pins, on top of a support structure built from a sandwich of Aluminium honey comb plates covered on both sides with layers of carbon fibre. The bi-cells are tilted with respect to the vertical of the support, in such a way to have auto-calibration event by event. The structure is considered to be stiff. The absolute positioning is provided by photogrammetry just after assembly.

The three groups made considerable efforts in order to present to the Panel as much information as possible. But some important points remain to be better understood (temperature effects, alignment corrections, tooling for mass production...).

### Working Procedure

The Panel received continuously documentation from the three groups, but the work of the Panel can be split into three phases:

Phase 1: Presentations on the various aspects including performance, calibration, mass production, alignment, safety, background, cost, etc. The Panel also visited prototype construction workshops at CERN (HPDT and JCC) and NIKHEF (HSC).

Phase 2: All members asked questions to the experts. These questions can be found in the above mentioned reports. During this procedure it became clear that, although the three technologies meet the ATLAS requirements, they are indeed very different in some aspects.

Phase 3: The Panel built up a recommendation process taking into account all relevant aspects (performance, concept and potentiality, reliability of operation, mass production etc). No single parameter as "single wire resolution" or "cost", can be considered as determinant by itself.

### Muon collaboration

Following an enquiry by the spokesmen, a very important information was given to the Panel. At this time, 17 different institutes agree to commit themselves to the muon spectrometer sub detector and this independent of the choice of technology. A preliminary survey of the financial and human resources does not show a major problem. Five institutes (Dubna, Frascati, Nikhef, Pavia, Protvino) are ready for a major construction effort. CERN is ready to commit itself on a task of project management. The muon community also urged the Panel for a recommendation as soon as possible. The need to unify behind one and only one option, the need to finalize the layout and to clarify the interferences with the magnet and calorimeter design require to make a choice as soon as possible. It is clear that neither a single Institute, nor even a small group of Institutes, can take the full responsibility to finance, to provide the required man power and to construct such a sub-detector. The final decision and responsibility lies in the hands of the full

ATLAS collaboration.

## 2 Concept and Potentiality

### The Basic Requirements to the Operating Characteristics of Drift Chambers.

There are several basic requirements to the operating characteristics in order to be suitable for a drift chamber based muon tracking system. These are:

Figure 4: _Cross section of the Honeycomb Strip Chamber_

Figure 3: _Basic scheme of alignment system using light rays_

* Small Lorentz angle (\(\Theta_{L}<10^{\circ}\)). The Lorentz effect, during the electron drift, modifies the space-drift time relation due to the dependence of drift velocity on B-field. Since the B-field for the air-core barrel magnet varies with the azimuthal angles \(\phi\) in the range \(\sim\)0.5-1.0 T, the space-time relation along the same anode wire (\(\Delta\Phi=\pi/4\)) should be stable with an accuracy of about 1%. This leads to the requirement \(\Theta_{L}<10^{\circ}\). Otherwise, a special \(\phi\)-dependent calibration procedure is needed.
* Relatively small total electron collection time (300-500 ns) in order to keep the single wire occupancy at an acceptable level (below 1%).
* The longitudinal diffusion of electrons in gas has to be kept as small as possible, in order to improve the spatial accuracy.
* The dependence of drift velocity on gas temperature and pressure (and composition) should be as weak as possible (\(<10^{-3}/^{\circ}K\) and \(<10^{-3}/1mmHg\)) in order to avoid additional recalibration.
* The adequate gas gain (\(\sim 10^{5}\)) for the improving of drift time accuracy with the desirable minimum high voltage. The limited streamer mode of operation is unacceptable due to possible ageing problems. (See below).
* for operational safety
- with good ageing properties.

The above mentioned operational requirements are controversial, in some cases, and depend on the technology.

The final gas composition has not been chosen for all the three technologies. Nevertheless the most difficult situation is in the case of round (HPDT) or honeycomb (HSC) tubes with diameter

Figure 5: Conceptual design of Jet Cell Chambers

\(\sim\)3 cm, where the electric field E for radius r\(>\)5 mm is very low ( E=0.2-0.6 kV/cm atm for r=15-5 mm), and the drift velocity is very small (\(\sim 10\mu m/ns\)) for gases with small \(\Theta_{L}\) (with the admixture of cooling gases like CO\({}_{2}\)). The large total collection time (\(T_{e\,\rm oil}>1\mu s\)) for such a low E-field can lead to limitations for the single tube (cell) size of HPDT (HSC) at the level of 15-20 mm in diameter.

The admixture of gases like CF\({}_{4}\) gives rise to the reduction of \(T_{e\,\rm oil}\) and the worsening the spatial resolution due to increase of longitudinal diffusion of electrons in gas. Even for diameters of 15-20 mm the sensitivity of the drift velocity to gas temperature (or pressure) variations is still large (\(\sim 3\cdot 10^{-3}/\!\!^{\circ}K\) or \(30\mu m/\!\!^{\circ}K\) for radius 10 mm).

In case of JCC there is the relatively high drift field (\(\sim\)2 kV/cm) and the drift velocity is saturated; therefore we have very weak sensitivity to the gas temperature (pressure), higher drift velocity for small \(\Theta_{L}\) giving a more st able operation. However, due to larger drift distance, the intrinsic spatial resolution is slightly worse (\(\sim 120\mu m/\!\!\)wire). This result is supported by full scale ZEUS Jet Cell chamber data.

### Chamber Gas: Safety, Ageing And Heating During the Operation

Gas systems for three (technologies differ by the number of gas connections (max: 6\(\cdot 10^{5}\) for HPDT). The 3 atmosphere pressure for HPDT gives rise to additional risks. The possibility of local change of gas composition (or pressure) is minimal for JCC because of the bigger gas volume. From the point of view of ageing the HPDT seem more risky; in case of limited streamer mode the total charge per 1 cm of wire for HPDT is estimated as \(\sim\)0.3 C/cm year (assuming a hit rate by neutrons and photons of 100 Hz/cm\({}^{2}\)); such a charge looks unacceptably large and would need additional study. No group is proposing to operate the chamber for the ATLAS muon spectrometer in streamer mode. For the proportional mode the corresponding numbers in the barrel region for a gas gain of \(10^{5}\) are \(\sim 0.1\) C/cm year for HPDT, \(\sim 0.03\) C/cm year for HSC, \(\sim 0.015\) C/cm year for JCC.

The presence of the magnetic field, neglected in these estimates, may lead to significantly lower numbers, due to quick re-absorption of the curling tracks in the tube walls. The value of 0.1 C/cm year would also need further study and special attention concerning the gas composition; if today's knowledge of hit rate evolves into an unfavourable direction (or when considering the end cap region with the present estimates) the ageing problem might become dangerous. The heat deposited per single wire during the operation would not negligible; it can be estimated (for \(\rm Im^{2}\) of muon station, gas gain \(10^{5}\), and hit rate of 100 Hz/cm\({}^{2}\)) as \(\sim 0.6\) W for HPDT, \(\sim 0.2\) W for HSC, \(\sim 0.1\) W for JCC. This heat deposition inside the muon tracker itself has to be taken into account as an additional source of temperature gradients in the gas and in the support structure.

### Support Structure and Alignment: Floppy vs. Stiff approach

The muon tracker is large area high precision detector. The final goal of alignment procedure is to know the exact position of each wire on the basis of the knowledge of the position of large area elements (support). In the case of HPDT there are many different steps between the position of each individual tube (with the precision knowledge of the diameter of the tube and keeping under control the assembly of each tube) through precision rulers on the marble table, and the final assembling into superlayers with the aluminium honeycomb support (which, in addition, is rather temperature sensitive). The continuous monitoring of wire position, as obtainable for instance using the CCD/RASNIK system proposed by the HSC group (see appendix D of ref. [2]), for this system is difficult. Due to the above mentioned reasons, the possibility to exploit the better intrinsic resolution of HPDT is not very convincing.

The JCC system has a fiber support which is much more stable and less temperature sensitive; it is an extreme case of stiff approach. Here the total precision is given more directly by precision wire supports and by the large area carbon fibre support.

HSC gives the example of extreme "floppy" approach, where large area precision is given (and monitored by RASNIK system) by precise "LEGO" blocks and templates. The position of the wires can be monitored continuously during the duration of the experiment. This approach of continuously monitoring the wire position should be proven with a full scale prototype in order to know the final accuracy achievable after correction of floppiness.

In JCC and HSC cases the achievable large area precision depends only on industrial fabrication standards; this makes HPDT inferior in this respect.

## 3 Performance

The performance of the ATLAS muon spectrometer depends in first instance on the spatial resolution per superlayer [i.e. per chamber]. It results from the intrinsic single wire resolution (discussed in subsection 3.1), the number of hit sense wires and the knowledge of their mechanical position with respect to the alignment references (discussed in subsection 3.2). In subsection 3.3, the layout described in the ATLAS milestone document is used as input for the calculation of the momentum resolution of the ATLAS muon spectrometer. With the high rate of background hits caused by a "gas" of low energy neutrons and photons in the cavern, the feasibility of the pattern recognition of muon tracks has become a crucial issue which is addressed in subsection 3.4.

### The single wire resolutions

So far, none of the proponents has finalised the studies concerning the operating conditions (HV, gas gain) and the choice of the (almost non flammable) gas. All the proposed chambers are supposed to operate in the proportional mode (to avoid ageing problems in the high background environment). The Jet Cell chambers and the Honeycomb chambers are operated at atmospheric pressure while the HPDT with their round aluminium tubes operate at higher pressure [nominally 3 bars] in order to increase the primary ionisation statistics leading to a gain in single wire resolution of roughly a factor 2. The results of prototype tests are given in fig. 6 in terms of the resolution as a function of the distance from the sense wire. The JCC which works in the saturated drift velocity regime with an acceptable maximum drift-time (500 ns) has reached an average level of 150-140 \(\mu\)m. Based on measurements done by the ZEUS collaboration on chambers with a similar wire arrangement and by increasing the gas gain, they expect to improve this figure down to about 120 \(\mu\)m. The HSC group has shown average resolutions better than 100 \(\mu\)m (see their latest results with the P3 prototype on the figure), but obtained with a slow gas (\(Ar/CO_{2},50/50\)) with an unacceptable maximum drift-time (more than 1\(\mu\)s with the 2.2 cm cell of the P3 prototype). Operating with a faster gas or a smaller cell size would presumably lead to an average resolution above this level of 100\(\mu\)m. More work is needed on this topic. Most of the tests with the HPDT have been done in the streamer mode leading to average resolutions at the level of 50 \(\mu\)m at 3 bars pressure. On fig. 6 the first results with the proportional mode are shown. With more studies of the operation mode, they hope to reach the same level of resolution as in the streamer mode.

The JCC group has also presented convincing results on the multi-hit capability of the chamber which shows that a two tracks separation of order 2-3 mm can be achieved. Although this capability is not really necessary for the tube arrangement of the HSC and HPDT (see pattern results of section 3.4), the HPDT group has shown preliminary results on two hits separation at the level of 2 mm. More work is needed to make this result more convincing but it is likely than the high pressure helps in this respect as compared to the HSC.

### The error budgets

To achieve or to improve on the design specifications of the Letter Of Intent, (70 \(\mu\)m per measurement station including the alignment contribution) a very good control of the mechanical tolerancesFigure 6: _Single wire resolution as a function of the distance to the sense wire for the 3 technologies. See text for comments._

is required. Table 1 gives the contributions to the final measurement error in the bending plane for the different chamber technologies with the present understanding of these tolerances. For each technology, several scenarii corresponding to different degrees of optimism on the single wire resolution and on the mechanical accuracy are proposed. For the JCC and the HSC, it is also proposed to increase the number of wires in the middle layer to improve the sagitta measurement. For instance the HSC group proposes to implement 2 stacks of 8 mono-layers arranged in a mattress layout similar to the one of the HPDT. As this layout leads to a much better angular resolution, it could also be adopted by the HSC for all the layers.

While the Jet Cells and the Honeycomb Strip chambers are still dominated by the error from the drift_time/distance relation, the High Pressure Drift Tubes are presently limited by the mechanical positioning of the tubes connected with the fluctuations in the tube diameters and possibly with

For each technology the left column gives what is considered as conservative estimates based on available prototype results. The middle column gives estimates of possible improvements. For JCC and HSC, the right column refers to a possible upgrade of the middle superlayer._the existence of spaces between neighbouring tubes. As shown with the data with the 1 m x 1 m prototype, the HPDT group proposes to use the muon tracks themselves to reduce this uncertainty on the knowledge of the wires positions. Actually, with the layout of triple layers organised in staggered rows of tubes, only a reasonable number of tracks (typically of order 200 muons above 1 GeV per tube) would be needed to connect the position of each wire to the ones of the edges. This would lead to the numbers given in the right column. Nevertheless, such a procedure would work only if the global structure of the chamber remains stable over the period used to accumulate the statistics. Also, the relative wire positioning may change along the wire direction so that the procedure would have to be repeated several times per chamber (ideally between each spacer).

An additional error connected to unavoidable bad controls of the chamber deformations has been added which acts as a kind of contingency.

### Momentum resolution

The calculation of the resolutions has been done for the layout shown in the ATLAS milestone document with a 2 dimensional field map of the 8 coil toroid. As the field integral varies from 2.3 Tm to 3.4 Tm when going from the medium plane between 2 coils to the coil plane, the resolutions are azimuth dependent functions. The chambers have been modelled by 2 planes of equal resolution, the combination of which reproduces the error per superlayer given in table 1. The distance between the 2 planes has been adjusted to match the angular resolution. The alignment error has been coherently applied to each double plane system. Fig. 7 shows the resolution as a function of pseudorapidity, at the average azimuth angle of 11.25 degrees with respect to the barrel coil plane, for the different technologies and for the 2 extreme degrees of optimism mentioned in table 1.

In these calculations, the half-lengths of the barrel and the length of the end caps toroids have been set to the nominal 13 m and 5.6 m respectively, while keeping the current in the end caps at 20 kA.

In the region of azimuth between the coil cryostats, the dominant source of multiple scattering comes from the struts joining two neighbouring coils. On the average, they are equivalent to a layer of 0.8 radiation length. With this average approximation and when the thickness of the trigger chambers is added (0.10 \(X_{0}\) for the 4 RPC layers of the present trigger scheme), the contributions from the precision chambers themselves do not lead to a significant dependence of the resolution at low \(p_{T}\) on the chamber technology. Going into more details, the magnet struts cover about 40 % of the barrel pseudorapidity range where a radiator of about 2X\({}_{0}\) is introduced between the inner and middle layers. In the region free of strut material the different contributions to the spectrometer resolution as a function of the muon momentum at zero rapidity are shown in fig. 8. In this region, the resolution below 150 GeV is limited by the matter of the chambers, introducing a relative difference of up to 20% at 50 GeV in favour of the JCC (the thinner case) as compared to the HPDT. In the region of the struts, the 3 point measurement can be helped by an angle-angle measurement between the middle and outer layers as shown in fig. 9. In this region, the best results are achieved by the technology which offers the best angular resolution (HPDT). At such low momenta the best compromise seems to be provided by the HSC with the mattress layout.

At high momenta, the momentum resolutions scale like the superlayer resolutions given in table 1. In this domain, the HPDT offer the best performance followed by the HSC and the JCC.

For about 9% of the acceptance, the calculation of the momentum is based on the measurement of the track angles in the bending plane made with only two chambers. Provided that a good control of the relative angular alignment of these chambers can be achieved, the resolutions that can obtained in such conditions are summarised in table 2. It shows the advantage offered by the mattress layout of the HPDT and possibly of the HSC while the JCC are too limited in angular Figure 7: _Transverse momentum resolution as a function of pseudorapidity for a spectrometer made of Jet Cells chambers (top), HPDT chambers (middle) or Honeycomb chambers (bottom). The upper curves refer to the conservative estimates of the error budget. The lower curves correspond to the possible improvement with an upgraded middle layer. All resolutions refer to an azimuth angle of 11.25 degrees w.r.t. the coil plane._

Figure 8: _Resolution at zero rapidity as a function of the muon momentum. The figure shows the different contributions: The energy loss fluctuations in the calorimeter, the multiple scattering in the precision chambers and the trigger chambers (RPC), and the measurement error including the alignment contribution. These resolutions have been computed for the case of the HSC with an optimistic assumption on the intrinsic resolution. The dashed area refers to the range of total resolution which corresponds to the range in the sagitta measurement error given on the figure. These curves do not include the small improvement which is expected when the angle-angle measurement between the middle and outer layers is taken into account._

resolution to provide a good measurement in this acceptance region.

### Occupancy and Pattern recognition

Simulations of the three different technologies in the presence of the neutron and photon backgrounds expected in the ATLAS cavern yield rates of background hits which are comparable within a factor of three, the JCC being the less sensitive to random hits due to the absence of tube walls while it is more affected by correlated background hits for the same reason. They result in an expected rate of background hits in these chambers of about 50 Hz/cm\({}^{2}\) at \(\eta\) = 0, and 3 times more at \(\eta\) = 1. Assuming detector channels 5 m long and 2 cm wide, with a maximum drift time of 500 ns, this translates into an average occupancy per superlayer of 2% at \(\eta\) = 0 and 6% at \(\eta\) = 1. Given the large uncertainties of these simulations, one must be prepared to cope with occupancies of the order of 10% in the muon chambers at the highest luminosity (i.e 10 2 % per wire).

In order to study the impact of such occupancies on the muon track reconstruction and to compare the various chamber layouts and technologies in terms of reconstruction efficiency and accuracy, a chain of simulation and pattern recognition programs has been developed. This study includes full digitisation of the hits (obtained through GEANT M.C.), pattern recognition and momentum reconstruction. It is restricted for the moment to the barrel air core toroid ans assumes that the bunch crossing time and the second coordinate (\(r-\phi\)) are provided by a system independent from the muon chambers themselves (e.g. RPCs with 3cm wide strips). Preliminary

The resolution values are based on angle-angle and point-angle measurements assuming that the alignment problems can be solved._studies shows that the results would not be strongly affected if the second coordinate was provided by the precision chambers themselves. Only the CPU time would be significantly increased. Fig. 10 illustrates how a single 2 GeV muon is properly reconstructed in this difficult environment.

For the comparative study of pattern recognition and momentum reconstruction efficiency, the assumptions for the different technologies are summarised in table 3. They correspond to background levels which are higher than the calculated ones by roughly a factor 5.

The results given in table 4 are obtained with 3000 simulated muon tracks in the range \(5<~{}P_{\mu}~{}<100~{}GeV\), \(-1.1<~{}\eta~{}<1.1\), \(0<~{}\phi~{}<2\pi\). These tracks are identical for different technologies. Thus the identity of the multiple scattering will lead to similar resolutions in this domain of momenta for the various options.

For the HSC technology, two cases have been considered :

Figure 10: _Example of a single track reconstruction in the Honeycomb strip chambers. The single tube occupancy is 12%, i.e. a factor 30 above the expected rate._

* First, the standard array called HSC12 consisting of 8 stacked layers of wires in each superlayer, i.e. a distance of 12 cm between the central planes of each quadruple layers.
* Second, the array called HSC36 that includes a separation of 24 cm between the 2 quadruple layers that form a super-layer, i.e. a distance of 36 cm between the central planes of each quadruple layers.

For the HPDT technology, the distance between the central planes of each of the two triple layers that form a super-layer is 36 cm.

A first conclusion of this preliminary study is the following:

* As far as muon reconstruction is concerned the JCC seems to be slightly inferior to the two other technologies. However, the figures quoted here correspond to a pattern recognition algorithm which is as much as possible the same for the three technologies. When looking at the detail of the events badly reconstructed with the JCC technology, it appears that at least some of them could be recovered with a more refined dedicated pattern recognition algorithm.... This potential improvement of the JCC performance is difficult to quantify but, in view of the few tenth of events that have been examined in detail, it seems unlikely that pattern recognition could be as performant with the JCC than with the other two technologies. In particular, a larger number of the failures correspond to muons with only hits in the inner and the outer chambers. In such cases, a good angular resolution helps in the long extrapolation between these layers. This influence of the resolution on the pattern recognition efficiency is illustrated by the improved results that would be obtained if the angular resolution of the JCC were at the level of the one of the HSC (see numbers between

* In the case of the HSC, separating super-layers into two distant sub-layers (technology HSC36 as compared to HSC12) significantly improves the reconstruction performance.
* The two technologies HPDT and HSC36 seem to be quite similar in reconstruction performances. At least for this sample of muon tracks that have an energy lower than 100 GeV.
* The potentiality of the reduction of non-stochastic errors, in the case of the HPDT, have not been taken into account in this study.
* the issue of the pattern recognition in the end caps has not yet been addressed. It is likely to be more problematic: more background, no sagitt a measurement thus no intermediate station before the long extrapolation toward the inner layer without having a good estimate of the momentum. Due to the presence of larger lever arms for the extrapolation (7 and 6 m), it is felt than a good angular resolution at the level of the superlayer would be helpful.

## 4 Mass Production

### Production

The three technologies have submitted to the Panel their concepts on the production process for the 5000 m\({}^{2}\) of muon chambers. These are documented in various notes submitted to the Panel, more detailed information can be found there. In the following only the relative merits and drawbacks of the three technologies in this respect will be discussed.

#### 4.1.1 Hpdt

The production process consists essentially of three phases: the assembly of the individual tubes, the gluing of the triple layers and, finally, the assembly into the plane chambers. For the fabrication of the individual tubes automatic production lines have to be set up. They have to execute a mechanically rather complex task (positioning of spacers around a thin sense wire over distances of several meters, sliding the tube over it, inserting and sealing the end plugs, crimping the wire under correct tension etc) with high and reliable output rates (eg. 4 production lines, each producing one tube every two minutes, for the production of about 290000 tubes in two years). Then the tubes have to be glued together to form triple layers with high precision (target 50 \(\mu\)m), an essentially manual operation requiring precise adjustment of rulers on a marble (to adapt to the diameter of the tubes). Then the triple layers are to be glued to the honeycomb support structure (which has industrial tolerances) whilst maintaining the flatness and precision of the triple layer, again an essentially manual operation. In the latter two steps, the knowledge about the stringent requirements, and therefore a detailed understanding of how to maintain the precision, has to be established and maintained throughout the duration of the production in different places. The basic concept of the HPDT to achieve precision of the wire location over large areas during production by gluing together small objects (tubes) seems intrinsically more difficult, as it relies heavily on human pareseverance in maintaining the required level of precision in manual steps throughout the full fabrication period. The Panel has strong reservations in this respect.

#### 4.1.2 Jcc

From the production point of view, the JCC offers a rather simple process involving precision in two steps: Fabrication of the bi-tubes and drilling of reference holes in the support. Despite the provision of a wiring machine the fabrication of the bi-tubes requires a lot of manual work (gluing at various steps) but the precision is provided by the benches and the supports which define the position of the wires. The support structure consists of Aluminium honeycomb panels with carbon fibre on both sides, the panels are cut and glued in a rather straight forward fashion involving no major complication or precision. The large area precision is achieved by drilling with a large machine the reference holes into the support. The final location of the bi-tubes on the support is mapped by means of photogrammetry with each object suspended in a way identical to its ultimate position. However, as the positioning and flatness cannot be checked after installation, this approach relies on the assumption that the ensemble is stable to the required precision over the duration of the experiment.

#### 4.1.3 Hsc

The production consists essentially of two steps. In the first step "monolayers" are produced. Again a lot of manual work is required to assemble the various components (folded foil, gluing of wire supports, stretching and fixing of the wires etc) but the precision for the positioning of the wires there is defined by the templates and the injection molded wire supports, depending on industrial standards only. In the second step again the precision in assembling the monolayers to form a "station" is defined by templates. Therefore, the finally achieved precision in the location of the wires depends to a large extend only on mechanical standards and it seems plausible that they can be maintained over the full period of fabrication in different places. The deformation of chambers (floppiness), and consequently the position of the wires, is lateron monitored with an alignment system for which the HSC group proposes the CCD/RASNIK system described in appendix D of ref. [2].

### Cost

At this stage no final design concepts, nor detailed engineering studies are available, consequently the cost calculations are mostly based on raw material costs for the major parts and sometimes on only coarse estimates for some not yet well defined parts of the systems. It is important to note that in the present costing no contingencies are included, in some cases the material costs contain only the quantity required in the system without counting for losses. All these factors may cause a potentially significant cost increase.

The three groups have handed in cost estimates, the details of which can be found in their summary reports. After readjustment of certain items, the cost of which should be a priori not different for different technologies, and adding items which are not accounted for but needed in all versions, it appears that the cost for HPDT and HSC are rather similar (some 17-18 **MCHF**) whereas the JCC is significantly more expensive (22-26 **MCHF**, depending on the layout). However, the difference is due to the fact that the support is fully fabricated in industry which means that an important sum is included for fabrication facilities and manpower which does not appear in the cost of the other versions. Taking this into account, the Panel concluded that the cost for the different systems is not a factor which can be used as a decisive argument in the choice of the muon system.

## 5 Conclusion and Recommendation

### General discussion

The three technologies proposed all meet the ATLAS requirements and none of them can be a priori excluded. As there are no new prototypes and results to be expected in the near future, the Panel decided that a small delay would not be useful. A longer delay could only be requested to gain a better understanding of the final design and the mass production aspects, but the muon community needs to be unified behind one single project and had requested through the experts and spokesmen to proceed as scheduled.

### The Three Options

Detailed simulation of the performance and studies on background sensitivity revealed no striking differences, however, certain aspects are more favourably dealt with by one or the other technology.

#### 5.2.1 Hpdt

The HPDT, due to the use of gas at high pressure, provide very good single wire resolution, a better superlayer total error (54 microns vs 63 for HSC and 71 for JCC) and a better angular resolution (0.2 mrad vs 1.1 for HSC and 2.0 for JCC). However, we must consider the performances of the full spectrometer and all aspects of the proposal. This implies that the level of performances is to be maintained in the final detector. The three steps of the assembly must maintain precision which does not offset the performances of a single tube. The extrapolation from the prototype to the mass production is not straightforward. Considerable design effort and development has still to go into the mass production and all related aspects.

A special concern exists about the tolerances of basic elements and on the assembly lines (tube dimensions,spacer assembly,glue thickness...). Furthermore, as mentioned above, the concept is not clear in case a Carbon fiber structure becomes mandatory.

It is agreed that the knowledge of the wire position can be significantly improved by using tracks, under the condition that the position is stable in time. Nevertheless, the hardware control of the wire position at time of construction is a valuable asset. If the system, or part of the system, does not hold the pressure, the real resolution will not be better with respect to the other proposed technologies.

#### 5.2.2 Hsc

The HSC present some advantages. The position of the wires can be controlled during the construction and monitored continuously during the the experiment, consequently, movement or deformation of chambers due to temperature changes and structural changes of the toroid can be continuously corrected for. The position of the wires is monitored at the level of their support and therefore is known over their whole length.

The cell size can be adapted in accordance with the improving knowledge of the occupancy. In the forward region the cell size can be chosen to cope with the high rates in specific areas.

With a mattress configuration in all planes and 2 x 8 detection layers in the mid-plane, the HSC can obtain the same angular resolution as the HPDT, and a good track reconstruction efficiency and a robust pattern recognition can be expected also in an environment which could be more difficult than anticipated (see table 4).

If the second coordinate with sufficient precision is difficult to obtain (alignment of the two systems) from the trigger system, the HSC offers the possibility of strip readout.

This proposal still contains several questions which need clarification:

1.The final accuracy which can be achieved after floppiness correction.

2.The deformation of the chambers due to thermal effects or structural changes must not exceed the possibilities of the monitoring system and the wire centering constraint (about 250 \(\mu\)_m_).

3.The best single wire resolution obtained so far(\(<\) 100 microns) has been measured with a slow gas.

4.The maximum sag tolerable in the mattress structure.

#### 5.2.3 Jcc

The JCC is considered as the safest approach if one is aiming at a resolution at the level of the Letter of Intent design specifications, but with little hope to go much further. The R&D program is substantially concluded (it is one of the reasons to be safe). Also the limited angular resolution was considered by some members as a real bad point with all the fears that it could jeopardize the pattern recognition in the end caps (high background rate, no sagitta measurement there). It also leads to a bad resolution in the 10% of acceptance with only 2 chambers. Furthermore they are not very adaptable in the "difficult" regions of the spectrometer.

### Conclusions

The choice of the air core toroid magnet demands an ambitious muon spectrometer.

Today, due to the difficulties to verify the wire position, the feasibility of achieving the highest precision in a large scale fabrication by this gluing technique, the temperature instability, the difficulties which could arise from the use of some 600000 high pressure gas connectors, the possibility to profit from the better single wire resolution is not convincing and the Panel considers the HPDT option as too risky to recommend. This points to the HSC which - with respect to the JCC - has the better performance and a better potential to adapt to the improving knowledge.

The Panel considers that the HSC proposal offers to ATLAS a good resolution combined with a good angular accuracy, an easy adaptability and at low cost. But the floppy approach should be proven. Therefore we propose to include in the panel recommendation some MILESTONES (the date for the milestones should be defined by the muon working group, but in the understanding of the Panel must not exceed one year).

The Panel expects that, as stated by the spokesmen, the muon community will unify and collaborate to meet the milestones.

The JCC proposal, with the quality of the R&D result, can be considered as a spare technology, almost ready.

### Recommendation

The baseline design should be the HSC with the following MILESTONES:

a) The muon community must show by means of a full-scale set-up that the principle of measuring and correcting the "floppiness" gives the desired precision on the knowledge of the wire position.

b) The implementation of an alignment system in a projective tower must be presented and tested on the full-scale set up.

c) The stiffness of the comb has to be demonstrated.

d) The design of the mattress structure (at least for the middle layers) must be studied and presented in detail.
