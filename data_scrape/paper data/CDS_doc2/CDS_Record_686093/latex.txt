**Abstract:**

This note evaluates signal crosstalk with OT and cold preamps, and noise correlation as a function of cable length. The effects on the \(\pi^{0}\) rejection has been studied using a Montecarlo simulation.

Introduction :

The use of warm preamps (OT electronics) in the strip section of the barrel calorimeter has several advantages related to space occupation, ease of design, ease of cooling, etc...Of course, the main price to pay is an increase of the noise in these channels compared to a solution with cold preamplifiers. Besides the first order increase in the noise, some concern was expressed about the crosstalk between strips for signals, and a potentially nasty correlation of the noise between neighbouring strips.

Both these effects could impact on the performance of the strips on \(\pi^{O}\) rejection which is achieved through a rather delicate algorithm [1].

It is well known that the higher input impedance in the case of the OT (50 \(\Omega\)) compared to cold preamps (<15 \(\Omega\)) increases the amplitude of signal crosstalk. We shall give here an analytical expression of the crosstalk signal, evaluate its amplitude and compare with test beam results from the RD3 prototype.

The question of noise correlation due to the coupling of the neighbouring noise sources via the crosstalk capacitance has also been known for some time by groups working on Si strips, and results in an anti-correlated component for the series noise that cancels out when summing adjacent cells (on the other hand the parallel noise is correlated and adds quadratically).

Section 1 and 2 deal with the calculation of these effects from an electronics point of view. In these following sections two methods have been used : calculation and simulation. Mostly the calculations were important to explain and understand the effects, by insisting on the important parameters modifying the behaviour of the system. The simulation is performed on Spice.

In section 3 the consequence of these effects on \(\pi^{O}\) rejection is evaluated by Monte-Carlo simulation in Dice.

### 1-Signal Crosstalk

In this section, we calculate the signal crosstalk due to a coupling capacitance \(C_{X}\) to the neighbouring strip, as shown in figure 1.

\(C_{d}\) is the detector capacitance, \(C_{X}\) is the coupling capacitance, \(I_{O}\) is the triangular signal coming from the detector. \(C_{t}\) is the total capacitance across the detector : \(C_{t}\)=\(C_{d}\)+\(C_{X}\)

The triangular signal \(I_{O}\) first sees an input pole. In the case of the cold preamp, there is no cable, so the pole is \(R_{in}C_{t}\),in which \(R_{in}(\,\approx\,150)\) is the preamp input impedance. In the 0T case, this pole is determined by the somewhat higher cable impedance (50\(\Omega\)). To calculate the crosstalk, we make the approximation \(C_{X}\)<<\(C_{d}\).

The current \(I_{S}\) which flows into the preamp and its neighbour,\(I_{X}\), are thus :

(1) \(I_{s}(s)\)=\(\frac{I_{o}(s)}{1+s\tau_{in}}\) with \(\tau_{in}\)=\(R_{in}C_{t}\) and \(C_{t}\)=\(C_{d}\)+\(C_{X}\)

(2) \(I_{x}(s)\)=\(\frac{sR_{in}C_{x}\cdot I_{o}(s)}{\left(1+s\tau_{in}\right)^{2}}\)

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:4]

We can now quantify the crosstalk as a function of \(\lambda\), to compare the characteristics of the cold preamp and the OT. The ratio Crosstalk/Signal at the time of the maximum of the signal is shown in figure 3.

For the cold preamp, \(\lambda\)\(\approx\) 0.3, which gives 4.7% (normalised with C\({}_{\lambda}\)/C\(\equiv\)1) of crosstalk. For the OT \(\lambda\)\(\approx\) 1 which gives 25% of crosstalk. The crosstalk signal is 5 times larger in the OT than in the cold preamp, due only to the first input pole.

Typical values for ATLAS are C\({}_{\mathrm{d}}\)\(\approx\) 300 pF and C\({}_{\mathrm{X}}\)\(\approx\) 50 pF [3] which would lead to 0.8% with a cold preamp, and 4.2% with the OT.

These curves (signal and crosstalk as functions of \(\lambda\)) can also be used to extract physical parameters of the detector. For instance, figure 4 represents measurements done at CERN on the OT UV region. The peaking time, the maximum of the signal and the crosstalk allow us to obtain the value of C\({}_{\rm t}\) (the total capacitance including eventual parasitic capacitance), the value of \(\lambda\) and C\({}_{\rm X}\) and compare them with the expected values.

In this example, we extract for the OT :

from the signal : tp = 42.5 ns and \(\tau_{\rm CRRC2}\)(measured) \(\approx\) 18 ns

\(\Rightarrow\lambda\)\(\approx\) 0.75

\(\Rightarrow\) C\({}_{\rm t}\)\(\approx\) 275 pF

from the Crosstalk : Xmax/Vmax = 0.03

\(\Rightarrow\) C\({}_{\rm X}\)\(\approx\) 30 pF

OT 4.3F: Xttk when ch4 pulsed alone

: #1 Ch4 tp=42.5ns

: #2 Xttk*10 Ch5

Measurements from the test beam done at CERN.

The crosstalk is close to 2% with C\({}_{\rm X}\) = 30 pF and

C\({}_{\rm t}\)\(\approx\) 275 pF ( see text )The crosstalk capacitance is close to the measured value on the detector with a capacitance [4], but the detector capacitance is more than 3 times larger, which is probably due to a very large parasitic capacitance on the summing and readout motherboard.

### 2-Noise crosstalk

#### 2.A- Setup and generalities

Figure 5 shows the schematic used both for simulations and calculations of the correlation factor for series and parallel noise.

\(\mathrm{e_{n}}\) and \(\mathrm{i_{n}}\) are respectively the series and parallel contributions of the electronic noise referred to the input of the OT preamp.

In the following, we will use a correlation factor,\(\rho\)[1][5],which represents a correlation coefficient of the noise (series or parallel) induced by a strip on its neighbour, defined as :

\[\rho=\frac{\sigma(\mathrm{v}+\mathrm{x})^{2}-\sigma(\mathrm{v}-\mathrm{x})^{2}}{4 \,\sigma(\mathrm{x})\sigma(\mathrm{v})}=\frac{\mathrm{E}\{\mathrm{x}\mathrm{v} \}}{\sigma(\mathrm{x})\sigma(\mathrm{v})}\]

_2.B- calculations for the case of cold preamp._

The goal of this section is to quantify the theoretical ratio (crosstalk noise) / (noise) in a simple case, simple because there is no cable, and give an algebraic expression of the correlation factor. We assume here C\({}_{\mathrm{X}}\)<<C\({}_{\mathrm{T}}\) to simplify the calculations.

Parallel noise.

It can be modelled by a current generator across the preamp input. Thus, the calculation is the same as for the signal, except that the current i\({}_{\mathrm{m}}\) is now an impulse \(\delta\) (t). The noise at the output of the preamp and the noise induced on the neighbour (crosstalk noise) are respectively given by (cf. equations (4) and (5) ):

\[\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{np}}(\mathrm{s})=\mathrm{i}_{\mathrm{n}}\frac{1}{1+\mathrm{ s}\tau_{\mathrm{in}}}\frac{\mathrm{R}_{\mathrm{f}}\tau\mathrm{s}}{(1+\mathrm{s} )^{3}}\]

\[\mathrm{X}_{\mathrm{np}}\left(\mathrm{s}\right)=\mathrm{i}_{\mathrm{n}}\frac{ \mathrm{R}_{\mathrm{in}}\mathrm{C}_{\mathrm{s}}\mathrm{s}}{(1+\mathrm{s}\tau_{ \mathrm{in}})^{2}}\frac{\mathrm{R}_{\mathrm{f}}\tau\mathrm{s}}{(1+\mathrm{s} )^{3}}\]

\(\tau\) is the shaper RC internal time constant, \(\tau_{\mathrm{in}}\)=R\({}_{\mathrm{in}}\)C\({}_{\mathrm{t}}\) and R\({}_{\mathrm{f}}\) is the feedback resistor of the current preamp.

The RMS noise \(\sigma\) is obtained by integrating the noise over the entire frequency spectrum.

\[\sigma^{2}=_{0}\int\infty\left\|\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{n}}\right\|^{2}\mathrm{d}f.\]

So we expect for the output noise and the crosstalk noise respectively :

\[\sigma_{\mathrm{p}}^{2}=\frac{\mathrm{R}_{\mathrm{f}}\mathrm{i}_{\mathrm{n}}^{ 2}}{32}\frac{3\lambda+1}{(\lambda+1)^{3}}\frac{1}{\tau}\]

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:10]

(15) \(\mathrm{V_{m}(s)=C_{x}e_{n}\,\frac{1}{1+s\tau_{in}}\frac{R_{t}\tau^{*}s^{2}}{(1+s \tau)^{3}}}\).

(16) \(\mathrm{X_{m}(s)=-C_{x}e_{n}\,\frac{R_{t}s^{2}}{(1+s\tau_{in})^{2}}\,\frac{\tau} {(1+s\tau)^{3}}}\)

which give similarly :

(17) \(\sigma_{x}^{2}=\)\(\frac{R_{t}^{2}C_{x}^{2}e_{n}^{2}}{32}\frac{\lambda+3}{(\lambda+1)^{3}}\,\frac{1}{ \tau^{3}}\)

(18) \(\sigma_{xx}^{2}=\)\(\frac{3R_{t}^{2}C_{x}^{2}e_{n}^{2}}{32}\frac{1}{(\lambda+1)^{4}}\,\frac{1}{ \tau^{3}}\)

(19) \(\frac{\sigma_{xx}}{\sigma_{s}}=\)\(\sqrt{3}\,\frac{C_{x}}{C_{x}}\,\frac{1}{\sqrt{(\lambda+1)(\lambda+3)}}\) This ratio is also proportional to the ratio of the crosstalk capacitance between strips, \(C_{x}\), and the total capacitance \(C_{t}\).

We have also 3:

Footnote 3: In the series case the relation is :

V(s) = - \(\frac{C_{t}}{C_{x}}\) [ X(s)+X(s)\(\lambda\tau\)s ] and so v(t) = - \(\frac{C_{t}}{C_{x}}\) [ x(t)+\(\frac{dx}{dt}(t)\,\lambda\tau\) ]

 The same calculation as for footnote 2 gives : \(\frac{\sigma(X)=-\rho\,\frac{C_{x}}{C_{t}}}{\sigma(V)}\)

-

(20) \(\rho_{s}=\)\(\frac{-\sqrt{3}}{\sqrt{(\lambda+1)(\lambda+3)}}\) and so \(\frac{\sigma_{xx}}{\sigma_{s}}=-\rho\,\frac{C_{x}}{C_{x}}\)

The **series** noise induces an **anti correlated** noise.

Numerical application

For \(\lambda\)=0.3 which is the case of the cold preamps, we have :

(21) \(\rho_{p}=0.33\) and so \(\frac{\sigma_{px}}{\sigma_{p}}=\)\(0.33\,\frac{C_{x}}{C_{t}}\).

(22) \(\rho_{p}=0.33\) and so \(\frac{\sigma_{px}}{\sigma_{p}}=\)\(0.33\,\frac{C_{x}}{C_{t}}\)(22) \(\rho_{\rm s}\) = -0.84 and so \(\frac{\sigma_{\rm x}}{\sigma_{\rm s}}=-0.84\,\frac{C_{\rm x}}{C_{\rm t}}\).

### 2.C- Noise correlation in the 0T.

a-simulation of the 0T case : determination of \(\rho\) as a function of the cable length.

In this case, we now include a cable, with a 50 \(\Omega\) impedance, and a delay \(t_{\rm d}\) between the detector and the preamps. It is thus more complex as the noise is now generated at the other end of the cable. We have to calculate what current flows into the line and what couples to the neighbour. Because of the transmission and reflection of a signal in a cable, calculation is unreasonably complicated for \(t_{\rm d}\neq 0\) and finite.

We use a simulation (Spice) in the ideal case, that means that the only input pole comes from the detector capacitance and the cable impedance. The preamp is ideal and followed by a CRRC\({}^{2}\) filter. Using the preceding notations, there is \(\lambda=\frac{R_{\rm in}C_{\rm t}}{\tau}\) with now \(R_{\rm in}\) = 50 \(\Omega\) (\(R_{\rm in}\) is 15 \(\Omega\) for the cold preamp).

The goal of this section is to simulate the response of an ideal chain (OT and CRRC\({}^{2}\) shaper) to a noise stimulation referred to the input of the chain (see figure 4) for different values of \(t_{\rm d}\). The results (the various \(\sigma\)s : \(\sigma\)(X), \(\sigma\)(V), \(\sigma\)(V+X)and \(\sigma\)(V-X) ) are combined to calculate the \(\rho\) factor as a function of \(t_{\rm d}\). Then we are able to compare the effect of noise correlation in the case of the 0T with the correlation factors in the cold preamp case.

Two simulations were made : first in the frequency domain, and then in the time domain. The reason for using both methods was to compare the results but also, if the calculation of noise is easier in the frequency domain, its physical understanding is easier in the time domain, because the noise depends on the delay \(t_{\rm d}\).

The Spice schematic used in the simulation is given in **Appendix n\({}^{\circ}\)1**. The typical value of \(C_{\rm X}\) is taken as 50 pF.

The figures 6 & 7 represent the parallel and series noise on an arbitrary scale as a function of \(t_{\rm d}\). The figure 8 represents the \(\rho\) factor for the parallel and series noise which comes from figures 6 & 7.

**b-discussion on the curves \(\rho\) vs. \(t_{d}\).**

\(\bullet\)discussion on the limits.

The appendix n'2 shows the pulse response in the time domain (series and parallel noise generator) for different values of \(t_{d}\). We have two contributions to the response V : first the pulse itself (at time 0) which goes directly into the preamp (1) andthen (2 t\({}_{\text{d}}\) later) the reflected part of the pulse (3). It is the transmitted signal (2) that creates the crosstalk (2) at time t\({}_{\text{d}}\), which is observed after passing the cable (3), arriving at time 2 t\({}_{\text{d}}\).

The following refers to Appendix n\({}^{\circ}\)2. The shape of these responses shows clearly that :

\(\bullet\) The maximum of E(XV) is at t\({}_{\text{d}}\)=0, when the reflected part of the signal is summed with the direct pulse.

\(\bullet\) When t\({}_{\text{d}}\)\(\rightarrow\)\(\infty\), \(\rho\)\(\rightarrow\) constant term. A mathematical demonstration shows that this constant term is 0, due to the shaper (see Appendix 3 for more details).

Intuitively, it is shown in Appendix n\({}^{\circ}\)2 for high values of t\({}_{\text{d}}\) that the reflected signal is very nearly the derivative of the crosstalk, so :

E(XV)=\({}_{\text{o}}\)!? x v dt \(\approx\)? x.x'dt = 0.

This is an approximation, but a more detailed calculation gives the same result algebraically.

\(\bullet\) The simulation has been done for different values of C\({}_{\text{X}}\) (30 pF and 200 pF). The values of \(\rho\) do not change by more than 1%.

3- Monte-Carlo simulation of the \(\pi^{\circ}\) rejection

_3.A- Monte-Carlo implementation._

The effects calculated above have been introduced in the DICE simulation of the barrel calorimeter.

The signal crosstalk is introduced in a straightforward way : the energy E deposited on strip number \(i\) is shared : \(\alpha\)E on strip \(i\)-1 and \(i\)+1, and (1-2\(\alpha\))E on strip \(i\).

The description of the noise crosstalk is a bit more delicate. Let \(\sigma_{\bf S}\) and \(\sigma_{\bf P}\) be the series and parallel noise on a strip, \(\rho_{\bf S}\) and \(\rho_{\bf P}\) the series and parallel correlation coefficient defined above.

The individual noises are first generated for strips \(i\)-1,\(i\) and \(i\)+1 with gaussian laws :

\(\nu_{\bf S}\)(i-1)=N(0,\(\sigma_{\bf S}\)) \(\nu_{\bf S}\)(i) =N(0,\(\sigma_{\bf S}\)) \(\nu_{\bf S}\)(i+1) =N(0,\(\sigma_{\bf S}\)) \(\nu_{\bf P}\)(i+1) =N(0,\(\sigma_{\bf P}\))

Then the noise induced on strip \(i\) by its neighbours is added.

\(\bullet\) Firstly the correlated part, proportional to the voltage induced by the individual noises :

\(\rho_{\bf S}\)\(\sigma_{\bf S}\)[\(\nu_{\bf S}\)(i-1)+\(\nu_{\bf S}\)(i+1)] +\(\rho_{\bf P}\)\(\sigma_{\bf P}\)[\(\nu_{\bf P}\)(i-1)+\(\nu_{\bf P}\)(i+1)]

\(\bullet\) Then the uncorrelated part, which is drawn randomly from a gaussian distribution, whose R.M.S is the quadratic sum of all uncorrelated contributions :

\(\mbox{N}\,(\,0\,,\sqrt{2\alpha^{2}[(1-{\rho_{\bf S}}^{2}){\sigma_{\bf S}}^{2} +(1-{\rho_{\bf P}}^{2}){\sigma_{\bf P}}^{2}]}\,)\)

The numerical values corresponding to the OT in ATLAS are given below :

\(\bullet\) Total capacitance of the strip : 300 pF.

\(\bullet\) Mutual ("crosstalk") capacitance between neighbour strips : 50 pF.

\(\bullet\) Signal crosstalk : 4.2%

\(\bullet\)\(\sigma_{\bf S}\)=13 MeV ; \(\sigma_{\bf P}\)=11.3 MeV

For the studies with noise correlation, the worst case was used : no delay between the induced pulses, leading to correlation coefficients :

\(\bullet\)\(\rho_{\bf S}\)= - 0.62 and \(\rho_{\bf P}\)= 0.62

### Results on \(\pi^{\circ}\) rejection.

The analysis is the standard one, developed for the Technical proposal. The variables used to discriminate between \(\gamma\) and \(\pi^{\circ}\) induced showers are : the width of the main cluster, the transverse energy of the second cluster found near the main one, the fraction of energy in the first sampling.

The rejections are given for all photons (converted or not), without using the tracker information. First the different effects are applied one by one, to study the consequence on the rejection against \(\pi^{\circ}\) at 50 GeV \(\ET\) (for 90% \(\gamma\) efficiency).

Figure 10 shows that the rejection does not change with the amount of signal crosstalk. In fact some sharing is already present before the crosstalk since the Monte-Carlo simulates correctly the induction of current on several strips by a single drifting charge.

Figure 11 shows the rejection as a function of the total random noise per strip, without correlation, showing that the expected value 17 MeV is about the largest tolerable without degrading the performance. On the same figure, the dependence with the coherent noise (all strips affected by the same value in one event) is shown, indicating that no more than 5 MeV is acceptable.

The table below gives the simulated rejection performance for the expected ATLAS situation with OT, applying one effect after the other (on the same event sample).

Table 1: R/\(\pi^{\circ}\) (Et=50 GeV, \(\eta\)=0.3, 90% \(\gamma\) efficiency)

No electronics effects 2.69 \(\pm\)0.09

+ Random noise without correlations 2.64 \(\pm\)0.10

+ Random noise with correlations 2.62 \(\pm\)0.09

+ Signal crosstalk 2.60 \(\pm\)0.10

+ Coherent noise 5 MeV/strip 2.59 \(\pm\)0.10

The computation with correlation coefficients applied is pessimistic, since due to the delay in cables the correlation coefficients would be lower for most of the channels ( as shown in figure 8).

However the fact that the rejection is not much affected even in this case gives confidence that the noise and crosstalk effects are safely under control in the OT case.

**Conclusion**

With respect to the signal crosstalk, it is clearly shown that the cold preamp has better characteristics. The signal crosstalk is 5 times larger in the OT than in the cold preamp case.

In the cold preamp case, the correlation factor is constant and depends only on the input impedance of the preamp. This is not the case for the OT. After a delay of 15 ns (a 3 meter cable), \(\rho\) becomes negligible for both series and parallel noise; that means that the correlated part of the total noise is negligible compared to the total noise. On the other hand, the correlation factor is constant in the case of the cold preamp, and larger than in the case of the OT with a 2 or 3 meter cable (or more), even though the input impedance of the readout chain is lower in the cold case.

A detailed Monte-Carlo simulation of these effects shows that the crosstalk in the signal and the noise does not much affect the \(\pi^{\circ}\) rejection. In particular the OT option does not degrade the \(\pi^{\circ}\) rejection. The main issue is rather that of the increase of the energy resolution due to the larger incoherent noise and the potential problem of the coherent (pick-up) noise.

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:24]

## APPENDIX N'3 : calculation of \({}_{p}\) in the case \(\mathbf{t_{d}}\rightarrow\ \infty\)

This appendix is dedicated to the calculation of the correlation factor for an infinite cable, which proves that the limit is algebraically 0. The results of the equations are not explicitly given, because they are very long. We consider here the method and the approximation used which leads to this conclusion.

The setup is shown here :

To calculate the reflected and transmitted parts of the signal, we have to study the equivalent impedance at the input of the cable (the output in the sense of the noise generator).

I is the noise pulse, Vt is the transmitted signal and Vr=Zqlr is the reflected signal.

(1) \(\tau_{\rm in}=\)Z\({}_{0}\)C\({}_{\rm t}\).

(2) \(\rm{Ir(s)}\)=\(\frac{Zt-Z_{0}}{Zt+Z_{0}}\)\(\frac{1-s\tau_{\rm in}}{1+s\tau_{\rm in}}\) is the reflected part of the signal due to a current impulse.

(3) \(\rm{It(s)}\)=2\(\frac{Zt}{Zt+Z_{0}}\) is the transmitted part of the signal that causes the crosstalk. C\({}_{X}\) is here not negligible, because it is the transmitted signal that causes the crosstalk.

If td is "infinite", then the reflected part of the signal comes "a long time " after the direct pulse. Then we can write E(XV)=E(XVf), and we can calculate this factor.

(4) \(\rm{I_{x}(s)}\)=\(\frac{Vt\cdot sC_{4}}{\left[(1+\frac{C_{4}}{C_{x}})(1+\tau_{\rm in}s)-1\right]}\)\(\approx\)2\(\frac{sC_{x}}{\left(1+\tau_{\rm in}s\right)^{2}}\) after simplifications, especially by considering C\({}_{X}\)<<C\({}_{\rm t}\).

H(s) is the transfer function of the filter and the current preamp. In our case, it is a shaper and an ideal OT, and then H(s)=R\({}_{\rm r}\)\(\frac{\tau s}{\left(1+\tau s\right)^{3}}\) in the CRRC2 case, but it is enough to consider that the filter has a limited bandwidth, that means has an integrator and then

(5) \(\rm{H(s)}\)=\(\frac{G(s)}{\left(1+\tau s\right)}\). That is the case of all physical filter that we use.

At the output, we have :

(6) \(\rm{Vo(s)}\)=\(\rm{H(s)^{*}}\)\(\rm{Ir(s)}\)

(7) \(\rm{Vx(s)}\)=\(\rm{H(s)^{*}}\)\(\rm{lx(s)}\)

We have the explicit expressions thanks to the equations (1) to (5), by taking any G(s). We can then determine :

(8) \(\rm{vo(t)}\)=\(\lambda\)-1(\(\rm{Vo(s)}\))(9) vx(t)=\(\lambda^{-1}\)(Vx(s)), in which \(\lambda^{-1}\) is the inverse Laplace transform.

(10) E{XV}=E{vo(t)vx(t)}=\(\int\ ^{\infty}\)vo(t)vx(t)dt.

Then an explicit calculation gives E{XV}=0, and then \(\rho\)=0.

The limit of the curve \(\rho\) as a function of td is zero whatever the filter. The only condition is to have a limited bandwidth, which is the case for all physical filters.

Note : The calculation is quite the same for td=0. (2) becomes : Ir(s)=\(\frac{Zt-Z_{0}}{Zt+Z_{0}}\pm 1\approx\frac{1-s\tau_{\rm in}}{1+s\tau_{\rm in}} \pm 1\), the term \(\pm 1\) depending of the nature of the pulse noise source, parallel (+1) or series (-1).
