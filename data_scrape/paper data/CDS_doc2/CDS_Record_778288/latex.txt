**Abstract**

This note describes the analysis of the soft electrons and related b-tagging in the Higgs boson associated production \(WH\) events. It details performance obtained with the first implementation in Athena framework (release 7.8.0) of the softeBuilder algorithm (located in Reconstruction/egammaRec), dedicated to the identification of low momentum electrons. It is based on the matching between a track and a cluster from the electromagnetic calorimeter. The cluster is built from a collection of cells around the position of the track extrapolated to the calorimeter. An electron identification estimator is constructed using information from the inner detector and the electromagnetic calorimeter. The performance of this method is detailed on samples \(H\to j\bar{j}\) (where \(j\) stands for \(b,c\) and \(u\) quarks) produced during the ATLAS Data Challenge 1. Comparisons with previous studies, done with the TDR layout, are also presented.

Introduction

The identification of the low transverse momentum (\(p_{T}<20\) GeV/c) electrons in jets with the ATLAS detector will be important in many areas of physics studies such as \(B\)-physics, calibration of the electromagnetic calorimeter for low-energy domain, \(\tau\) identification and lepton \(b\)-tagging.

The standard electron reconstruction and identification procedure (egammaBuilder algorithm in Reconstruction/egammaRec) uses a calorimeter cluster, built by the Sliding Window algorithm, as a seed. While this method is efficient for high energy isolated electrons, it fails for electrons inside hadronic jets, such as those from semileptonic heavy-flavour decays. Indeed hadron and electron showers tend to overlap in collimated jets so that electron cluster characteristics are obscured.

An alternative electron identification procedure takes full advantage of the tracking capabilities of the inner detector. The method is based on the extrapolation of reconstructed charged particle trajectories into the electromagnetic calorimeter. For a given track, only the energy contained in a small window along the track extrapolation is used. The contribution of neighbouring hadronic showers is therefore reduced. The algorithm is geared towards low energy electrons, but it reconstructs also high \(p_{T}\) energy electrons. Nevertheless it should be emphasised that the algorithm was not optimised for energy measurement.

The method was originally developed in the Atrecon framework, and its performance for the tagging of b-jets was reported in [Kaczmarska A., 2000] and references therein.

This note describes results on soft electrons identification and soft electron b-tagging obtained with the first implementation of the same algorithm within the Athena framework. The algorithm is implemented as part of the standard electron/photon reconstruction package Reconstruction/egammaRec. The package reconstructs electron/hadron discriminating variables. The identification procedure of the soft electrons itself has not been implemented in Athena yet. The construction of a discriminating function, from the previously calculated discriminating variables, is done up to now in PAW. A dedicated particle identification procedure within Athena is foreseen in the future.

The note is organised as follows. Data samples used in this analysis are described in section 2. The performance of the electron identification procedure is given in section 3. Finally the soft electron b-tagging procedure and performance are shown in section 4.

## 2 Data samples

For comparison purpose two data sets, with the same processes are used, DC1 and TDR data. In both cases the samples contain events from Higgs-boson associated production, \(WH\) with \(W\to\mu\nu\). The signal sample consists of \(H\to b\bar{b}\) events and background samples of \(H\to c\bar{c},u\bar{u}\) events. We consider two different masses of the Higgs boson: \(m_{H}=120\) GeV/c\({}^{2}\) for DC1 data and \(m_{H}=100\) GeV/c\({}^{2}\) for TDR ones1.

Footnote 1: This change in the Higgs mass was found to have no significant impact on rejection of pion tracks in \(H\to b\bar{b}\) sample [Kaczmarska A., Derue F., 2003]

A sample of \(H\to b\bar{b}\) filtered for electrons on generation level allows to enrich statistics of electrons for performance studies. It is used only to build the probability density functions (PDFs) during the identification procedure. The preselection cuts for that sample are as follows:* both \(b\)-quarks (before final state radiation, FSR) are required to have transverse momentum \(p_{T}^{b}>15\) GeV/c and pseudo-rapidity \(|\eta_{b}|<2.5\);
* at least one electron with \(p_{T}^{e}>1\) GeV/c is required to be found in a cone \(\Delta R=\sqrt{\left[\Delta\eta(e,b)\right]^{2}+\left[\Delta\phi(e,b)\right]^{2 }}<0.4\) around each \(b\)-quark axis (before FSR).

The DC1 data correspond to more realistic simulation than the TDR ones. Several additional effects were taken into account after the Physics TDR. The material budget in front of the electromagnetic calorimeter has considerably increased, by \(\sim 35\%\) in front of barrel and by a factor \(\sim 2\) in front of end-cap modules. The DC1 simulations in contrast to the TDR were done with a non-uniform solenoid field of 2 T, reduced to 1 T at \(z=2\) m. A more detailed presentation of the evolution of these data samples since the TDR as well as on the simulation step can be found in [ATLAS DC1 Task Force, 2003], [Correard S. et al., 2004].

These DC1 data, without pileup, are reconstructed using Athena release 7.8.0. In particular following parameters are used:

* tracks in the inner detector are reconstructed using xKalman. All options are set to the default values, and the internal bremsstrahlung fit is enabled. It is important as the electrons of interest have rather low momenta, so the inclusion of the corrections for bremsstrahlung effects play a significant role in the proper calculation of the track parameters. The study of performance of bremsstrahlung recovery was not intended in this note;
* reconstructed tracks are extrapolated to the electromagnetic calorimeter to seed the cluster and thus the quality of extrapolation is crucial. In order to suppress the contribution from badly reconstructed tracks, the standard track quality cuts are used;
* jets are reconstructed with the cone algorithm with the default options;
* samples are reconstructed with and without electronic noise in the electromagnetic calorimeter. Samples without noise were used only for systematic checks.

### Sources of electrons

Low momentum electrons can originate from the decays of particles from the hadronic cascade or from the interaction of particles with the detector material. The signal electrons come from the following processes :

* direct (\(b\to e\)) and cascade (\(b\to c\to e\)) semileptonic decays of \(b\)-hadrons with an electron in the final state;
* leptonic decays of \(J/\Psi\) coming from \(b\) decays (\(b\to J/\Psi\to ee\));
* decays of \(b\)-hadrons to \(\tau\)-leptons with subsequent decays into electrons (\(b\to\tau\to e\)).

The background electrons arise from the following processes:

* \(\pi^{0}\) Dalitz decays (\(\pi^{0}\to e^{+}e^{-}\gamma\));
* \(\gamma\)-conversions occurring in the inner detector material;
* decays of light hadrons.

The kinematics of the background electrons is different from the one of the signal electrons. In Fig. 1 normalized distributions of \(p_{T}\) and \(|\eta|\) for signal electrons from \(H\to b\bar{b}\) and

Figure 1: _Normalised distributions of transverse momentum \(p_{T}\) and pseudo-rapidity \(|\eta|\) for signal electrons from \(H\to b\bar{b}\) (hatched histograms) and background electrons from background samples (empty histograms)._

background electrons from background samples are presented. In Tab. 2 the mean values of transverse momentum \(p_{T}\) of the signal and background electrons in all data samples used are shown. The background electrons have softer momentum spectrum than the signal ones. They are dominated mainly by electrons from conversions due to the material in front of the electromagnetic calorimeter.

## 3 Electron identification

### Overview of the soft electron identification

A short description of the softeBuilder algorithm procedure is as follows. The following quantities are used to select _good quality_ tracks :

* at least one hit in the pixel detector B-layer;
* at least two hits in the pixel detector;
* at least nine precision hits (pixels + SCT);
* impact parameter of the track in the transverse plane \(|A_{0}|\leq 1\) mm.

Two further selection criteria are applied :

* at least one high energy hit (TR hit) in the TRT detector along the track;
* at least 20 hits in the TRT detector along the track.

Only tracks with transverse momentum of the track \(p_{T}>2\) GeV/c were used in the analysis. These criteria are found to reject \(\sim 15\%\) of electron tracks and \(\sim 24\%\) of pion tracks.

All the tracks that pass the _good quality cuts_ are extrapolated to the particular samplings of the calorimeter. In each one, the cell with the maximum energy is searched within a small \(\eta\) and \(\phi\) window around the extrapolation :

* \(\Delta\eta\times\Delta\phi=3\times 3\) in presampler;
* \(\Delta\eta\times\Delta\phi=3\times 1\) in strip compartment;
* \(\Delta\eta\times\Delta\phi=3\times 3\) in middle sampling;
* \(\Delta\eta\times\Delta\phi=3\times 1\) in back sampling.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|c|c|c|} \hline  & \(b\)-hadrons & \(d\)-hadrons & \(\gamma\)-conversions & other sources & pions \\  & & & + Dalitz & of electrons & \\ \hline \(H\to bb\) & 13.7 & 7.1 & 4.9 & 5.2 & 5.0 \\ \hline \(H\to u\tilde{u}\) & - & - & 6.3 & 6.2 & 6.3 \\ \hline \(H\to c\overline{c}\) & - & 8.5 & 5.0 & 4.9 & 5.4 \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 2: _The mean \(p_{T}\) (in GeV/c) of electrons from various sources in various data samples (with \(p_{T}>2\) GeV/c cut). For comparison purpose \(<p_{T}>\) for pions is also given._Fig. 2 shows the distributions of the difference between the position of the track extrapolation and the hottest cell around it, for electrons from \(H\to b\bar{b}\) sample and pions from \(H\to u\bar{u}\) and \(c\bar{c}\) samples. Electromagnetic showers start earlier than hadronic ones, therefore the energy deposited in the presampler and the first sampling is very small and comparable to the electronic noise for pions, therefore the distribution in \(\eta\) is flatter than for electrons. In the third sampling the deposit of the electron is small and therefore the distribution is flatter than for the deeper penetrating hadronic shower of pions. Due to the low granularity in \(\phi\) of the first and third samplings only one cell is used to search for a hot cell. This reflects in the obtained distributions, were only one cell is indeed used.

Fig. 3 shows the distribution obtained in \(\eta\) for electrons in the barrel and in the endcap. The distribution obtained in the end-cap is broader. This is due to the increase in the material budget in front of the calorimeters which induces more multiple scattering, bremsstrahlung and thus a worse quality of the matching between the track extrapolation and the real position of the shower.

In each sampling of the calorimeter the list of cells around the impact point is established in following windows: \(3\times 5\) in presampler, \(19\times 5\) in strip compartment, \(9\times 13\) in

middle sampling, \(5\times 13\) in back sampling. Then a cluster is created and a set of discriminating variables is defined basing on transverse and longitudinal shapes of electromagnetic showers, combining calorimeter and inner detector information. For example in the third sampling we expect larger energy deposit for pions than for electrons. This sampling is thus crucial for the rejection of pions as it will be shown later. All calculated variables are added to the standard combined ntuple. Further analysis is performed with a set of private kumacs.

### Discriminating variables

The variables used to identify reconstructed tracks as electrons and to reject other tracks can be classified as follows:

- Variables using inner detector information only:

* number of high energy hits in the TRT detector along the track;
* transverse impact parameter.

-Variables using combined information from the inner detector and the electromagnetic calorimeter:

* the ratio of the transverse energy deposited in the electromagnetic calorimeter, to the transverse momentum reconstructed in the Inner Detector; \(E(core)\), the core energy is computed from: \(3\times 3\) in the presampler, \(15\times 3\) in the strips, \(5\times 5\) in the middle, \(3\times 5\) in the back.
* difference between the track and the shower positions measured in units of distance between the strips, where \(i_{m}\) is the impact

Figure 3: _Distributions of the difference between the position of the track extrapolation and the hottest cell around it (in cell units) in the first sampling. Distributions are shown for electrons from \(H\to b\bar{b}\) sample with \(|\eta|<0.8\) (left plot) and \(2.0<|\eta|<2.5\) (right plot)._

cell for the track reconstructed in the inner detector and \(E_{i}\) is the energy deposited in the \(i\)-th cell in the \(\eta\) direction for constant \(\phi\) given by the track parameters.

- Variables using electromagnetic calorimeter information (based on the track impact position):

* fraction of the energy deposited in the first longitudinal compartment of the electromagnetic calorimeter. The \(E_{1}(3\times 1)\) energy is computed using 3 strips in \(\eta\), centred around the maximum energy strip. \(E\), the energy deposited in the electromagnetic calorimeter is computed in the barrel from: \(3\times 1\) in the strips, \(3\times 3\) in the middle, \(3\times 3\) in the back. In the end-caps we use: \(3\times 1\) in the strips, \(5\times 5\) in the middle, \(5\times 5\) in the back.
* fraction of the energy deposited in the third compartment of the electromagnetic calorimeter. The \(E_{3}(3\times 3)\) energy in the back sampling is the sum of the energy contained in a \(3\times 3\) window around the maximum energy cell;
* shower isolation in the electromagnetic calorimeter from the ratio of energy deposited around the extrapolation in a \(3\times 3\) and \(3\times 7\) clusters. More precisely, for the "\(3\times 3\)" cluster, sampling by sampling, the cell energies are summed on the following \(\eta\) by \(\phi\) windows: \(1\times 1\) in the presampler, \(3\times 1\) in the strips, \(3\times 3\) in the middle, \(3\times 3\) in the back. In the case of "\(3\times 7\)" cluster, sampling by sampling, the cell energies are summed on the following \(\eta\) by \(\phi\) windows: \(3\times 3\) in the presampler, \(15\times 3\) in the strips, \(3\times 7\) in the middle, \(3\times 7\) in the back.
* using the highest energetic strip and its neighbour on each side the shower width is calculated.

Tab. 3 reports the quantities stored in the Combined Ntuple via CBNT_egamma_SE.

Distributions of each discriminating variable for signal electrons from \(H\to b\bar{b}\) and pions from background samples are shown in Fig. 4. In Fig. 5 the distributions of some of the discriminating variables for the signal electrons from \(H\to b\bar{b}\) and pions from \(H\to u\bar{u}\) based on TDR and DC1 samples are presented.

The impact of the material in front of the electromagnetic calorimeter can be seen in the \(E_{1}/E\) distribution. As the showers start earlier in DC1 layout

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|} \hline Quantity & CBNT variable & meaning \\ \hline \(E_{1}(3\times 1)/E\) & eg\_F\(\,\)Isoft\_SE & fraction of the energy deposited in the first \\  & & longitudinal compartment of the EM \\ \(E_{1}(3\times 1)/E\) & eg\_F3soft\_SE & fraction of the energy deposited in the third \\  & & compartment of the EM \\ \(ISO\) & eg\_Isol\_SE & shower isolation in the EM \\ \(W\) & eg\_Weta1\_SE & shower width using three strips \\ \(POS\) & eg\_Pos7\_SE & position (in \(\eta\)) from \(\pm\) 7 strips \\  & & around predicted one \\ \(E(core)\) & eg\_Ecore\_SE & the core energy \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 3: _Quantities written in the Combined Ntuple associated to the gammaRec/sofbeBilder algorithm._of energy deposited by electrons and pions in the first sampling of the calorimeter in comparison to the TDR layout can be observed.

The distribution of the difference between the track and the shower position is broader in case of DC1 sample. This is due to the more complicated extrapolation in DC1 reconstruction, using the non constant field map, as well as the increase in the material budget (_e.g_ more bremsstrahlung for electrons) compared to the TDR.

Because of changes in the shapes of discriminating variables we expect slightly different performance for the electron identification in DC1 and TDR samples.

Figure 4: _Distributions of discriminating variables obtained with DC1 data. Hatched histograms - signal electrons from \(H\to b\bar{b}\), empty histograms - pions from background samples._

### Construction of the discriminating function

The distributions of the continuous variables are treated as probability density functions and smoothed using the PAW smoothing procedure. The only exception is \(N_{TR}\) for which a look-up table is prepared.

The probability distributions of the identifying variables show a significant dependence on the pseudorapidity of the track. Therefore, they are calculated in five pseudorapidity bins : (0, 0.8); (0.8, 1.4); (1.4, 1.8); (1.8, 2.0); (2.0, 2.4).

#### 3.3.1 Separation variable

In order to estimate the discriminating power of each discriminating variable, we use an estimator called raw separation, originally defined in the Babar collaboration

Figure 5: _Normalised distributions of \(E_{T}/p_{T}\), of \(POS\) the difference between the track and the shower position in the strip compartment (with a zoom for pions in the range \(0-0.03\)), of \(E_{1}/E\) the fraction of the energy deposited in the first sampling and \(|A_{0}|\) the transverse impact parameter. Distribution are shown for signal electrons from \(H\to b\bar{b}\) (left) and pions from \(H\to u\bar{u}\) (right). Empty histograms - TDR, hatched - DC1._[Versille S., 1999]:

\[<s_{raw}^{2}(x)>=\frac{1}{2}\int\frac{(P_{h}(x)-P_{e}(x))^{2}}{P_{h}(x)+P_{e}(x)}dx, \tag{1}\]

where \(x\) represents the variable for which we calculate the separation. This definition supposes that \(P_{e}(x)\), the probability that the track originates from a signal electron, and \(P_{h}(x)\), the probability that the track originates from non-signal hadron, are normalized to unity. Tab. 4 shows the raw separation values obtained for each discriminating variable in all \(\eta\) bins.

Thus we can rank the variables by decreasing discriminating power. The most discriminating variable is the number of high threshold hits \(N_{TR}\). The variable \(E_{T}/p_{T}\) is more discriminating in DC1 than in TDR sample. This is illustrated in Fig. 5, where the distribution of \(E_{T}/p_{T}\) for pions obtained for DC1 sample is shifted toward low value, and thus more separated to the distribution obtained with electrons, than for TDR sample. For \(E_{1}/E\) the separation is of the same order as in TDR. As already mentionned, both electrons and pions deposit more energy in the first sampling in DC1 than in TDR layout. Thus, despite shifts in distributions, between the two layouts, the separation between electrons and pions remains the same. Still, we can notice that differences in separation values are more important in some \(\eta\) bins. This illustrates the importance of the optimization of the identification procedure in various \(\eta\) bins.

The raw separation is not used afterwards. But it could be a fast and convenient way to test the interest of new variables.

Ideally one would like to combine the most discriminating variable with each of the \(N-1\) remaining variables and restart the computation of raw separation. Finally we should reach a plateau when all possible information is taken into account, showing that no more variable is useful but this process would require to do \(N\) dimensional integrals, leading to empty bins and problems of computation. Such a study can be performed only if very high statistics is available.

#### 3.3.2 Discriminating function

For each track the discriminating function \(D_{track}\) is calculated as:

\[D_{track}=log\frac{\prod_{i}P_{e}(x_{i})}{\prod_{i}P_{h}(x_{i})}, \tag{2}\]

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|} \hline \hline \(\eta\) range & all \(\eta\) & \(0-0.8\) & \(0.8-1.4\) & \(1.4-1.8\) & \(1.8-2.0\) & \(2.0-2.5\) \\ \hline \hline \(N_{TR}\) & 0.70 (0.67) & 0.73 (0.66) & 0.70 (0.66) & 0.80 (0.80) & 0.79 (0.84) & 0.66 (0.75) \\ \hline \(E_{T}/p_{T}\) & 0.50 (0.33) & 0.56 (0.43) & 0.52 (0.33) & 0.30 (0.21) & 0.60 (0.41) & 0.60 (0.44) \\ \hline \(E_{1}/E\) & 0.47 (0.47) & 0.49 (0.53) & 0.49 (0.54) & 0.50 (0.44) & 0.50 (0.44) & 0.48 (0.41) \\ \hline \(E_{3}/E\) & 0.41 (0.46) & 0.41 (0.57) & 0.39 (0.52) & 0.37 (0.30) & 0.52 (0.43) & 0.51 (0.44) \\ \hline \(A_{0}\) & 0.34 (0.44) & 0.37 (0.47) & 0.36 (0.38) & 0.36 (0.42) & 0.32 (0.37) & 0.26 (0.38) \\ \hline \(POS\) & 0.24 (0.32) & 0.27 (0.35) & 0.26 (0.34) & 0.27 (0.25) & 0.27 (0.36) & 0.18 (0.37) \\ \hline \(W\) & 0.17 (0.15) & 0.19 (0.25) & 0.20 (0.14) & 0.20 (0.13) & 0.21 (0.38) & 0.26 (0.46) \\ \hline \(ISO\) & 0.08 (0.12) & 0.11 (0.15) & 0.10 (0.10) & 0.08 (0.11) & 0.13 (0.24) & 0.15 (0.37) \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 4: _The raw separation obtained with the \(H\to b\bar{b}\) sample for DC1 data (TDR data) for each discriminating variable. They are ordered by increasing separation obtained for DC1 sample for all \(\eta\) values. The crack region is taken into account in bin \(1.4-1.8\)._where \(x_{i}\) denotes the value of the \(i\)-th variable for the given track, \(P_{e}(x_{i})\) is the probability, obtained from the single variable \(x_{i}\) that the track originates from a signal electron, \(P_{h}(x_{i})\) is the probability that the track originates from non-signal hadron and \(i\) runs through all the variables used by the algorithm.

To avoid any bias of performance the samples to estimate this discriminating function has to be different than the one which provided the PDFs. For PDFs preparing we used \(H\to b\bar{b}\) filtered for electrons and half of available \(H\to u\bar{u}\) and \(H\to c\bar{c}\) samples.

Distributions of \(D_{track}\) obtained for signal electrons and background pions tracks are shown in Fig.6. The ratio of likelihood \(D_{track}\) does not take into account correlations between the variables. It reflects in the distributions obtained for electrons and pions which overlap and present large tails. Some statistical analysis tools, such as Fisher method or neural network, can take into account these correlations. The use of Fisher method was studied in [Derue F., Kaczmarska A., 2003], [Ali O., 2003]. It shows that the correlation between variables are rather small, not larger than 40%. This study was too preliminary to be included in this note but we do not expect large improvement from such a method.

### Identification efficiency for signal electrons

The identification of a candidate track as originating from a signal electron is based on the value of the discriminating function \(D_{track}\) assigned to the given track. Those tracks for which the value is below a given threshold are rejected. The identification efficiency versus the rejection power of the algorithm is obtained by varying the value of this threshold.

To quantify the performance of the identification procedure, the following efficiency and rejection factors are defined :

* electron identification efficiency: \[\varepsilon_{e}=\frac{N_{e}^{t}}{N_{e}},\] (3)

Figure 6: _Normalized distributions of the discriminating function \(D_{track}\) for signal electron tracks in \(H\to b\bar{b}\) (dashed) and pions in \(H\to u\bar{u}\) (empty)._

where \(N_{e}\) is the number of _good quality_ signal electron tracks in the signal samples and \(N_{e}^{t}\) is the number of _good quality_ signal electron tracks identified as a signal electrons track;
* charged pion rejection: \[R_{\pi}=\frac{N_{\pi}}{N_{\pi}^{t}},\] (4) where \(N_{\pi}\) is the number of _good quality_ pion tracks, and \(N_{\pi}^{t}\) is the number of _good quality_ pion tracks misidentified as a signal electron track.

The rejection factors obtained for pions in various types of samples are presented in Tab. 5 and in Fig. 7. For an efficiency \(\varepsilon_{e}=80\%\) rejection of pions tracks is \(135\pm 5\) for \(H\to b\bar{b}\). It is in good agreement with TDR results. For lower efficiency results are worse for DC1 data as can be partially explained by the differences between the distributions of variables shown in section 3.2 as well as different raw separation values detailed in Tab.4.

These values are lower than in TDR and it is mostly due to the differences in the transverse impact parameter \(A_{0}\) for DC1 and TDR layout as detailed in Appendix A.

Fig. 8 presents pion rejection factors for various samples, for signal electron identification efficiency fixed at \(\varepsilon_{e}=80\%\). The degradation of performance in the endcap region for DC1 data in comparison to TDR data is due to the increase of the material budget in front of the electromagnetic calorimeter.

In samples with no electronics noise included in the electromagnetic calorimeter at reconstruction level \(\sim 10\%\) higher performance is obtained.

### Rejection of electrons from conversions

A significant source of low \(p_{T}\) electron tracks in jets are photon conversions and Dalitz decays. Such tracks might be identified by the algorithm as signal electron tracks. The track _good quality_ cuts help in part to suppress that type of background. In case of \(\gamma\)-conversions and Dalitz decays \(e^{+}e^{-}\) pairs with small invariant mass are observed in the detector. To find them the standard package for the conversion finding implemented in Athena, ConversionAlgs/ConversionFinder can be used. The algorithm searches for pairs of oppositely charged particles and performs a \(\chi^{2}\) fit assuming a common vertex. If, for the electron track candidate, ConversionFinder finds a partner with \(\chi^{2}_{conv}\) below a given threshold, \(\chi^{2}_{conv}<200\), the track is rejected.

Photons and neutral pions in analysed jets have typically low momenta. As shown in Tab. 2 electrons from conversions or Dalitz decays have average momenta around 5 GeV/c

Figure 9: _Conversion rejection factors \(R_{conv}\) for tracks in \(H\to u\bar{u}\) as a function of the efficiency for identifying signal electrons without (open squares) and with (full circles) using the conversion package._

(after _good quality_ cuts and with \(p_{T}>2\) GeV/c). In general, the photon momentum is not equally divided between the electron and the positron and one takes most of the available momentum. Then the lower energetic partner may not be reconstructed by the track reconstruction package. Due to the high track density in the jet also hits wrongly associated to the tracks decrease the efficiency of the conversion finding algorithm. These two effects lead to a lower efficiency for identifying \(\gamma\)-conversions and Dalitz decays by the ConversionFinder package than that can be expected from the sample of photons with high \(p_{T}\).

For the analysed samples the rejection obtained using the \(\chi^{2}_{\it conv}\) variable, provided by the package, is factor \(\sim 2\) for tracks after the _good quality_ cuts.

Based on the soft electron identification procedure, the rejections \(R_{\it conv}\) obtained for electrons from \(\gamma\)-conversions in \(H\to u\bar{u}\) with and without using ConversionFinder are presented in Fig. 9. For an efficiency \(\varepsilon_{e}=80\%\) rejection of electrons from conversions and Dalitz decays is \(3.2\pm 0.2\) with the conversion package and \(1.8\pm 0.1\) without. Thus, the gain from using the conversion package is about factor \(1.8\pm 0.2\), in good agreement with what expected.

## 4 Soft electron b-tagging

The soft electron b-tagging method complements the secondary vertex tagging [Wolter M., Kaczmarska A., 2000] via its sensitivity to the leptonic b-decays. The branching ratio of \(B\)-meson decays to leptons is about 10.5% per lepton family.

### Overview of the soft electron \(b\)-tagging

The soft electron b-jet tagging method is based on the signal electron identification procedure:

* for each track in the jet the value of the discriminating function \(D_{\it track}\) is calculated;
* for each jet the track with the highest value of \(D_{\it track}\) is chosen and its value of the discriminating function is taken as the value of the discriminating function for the jet, \(D_{jet}~{}=~{}max(D_{\it track})\);
* for a given threshold \(D_{jet}^{\it thr}\) a jet with \(D_{jet}\geq D_{jet}^{\it thr}\) is tagged as a \(b\)-jet.

The efficiency of the \(b\)-tagging algorithm is defined as:

\[\varepsilon_{b}^{\it alg}=\frac{N_{b}^{t}}{N_{b}^{e}}, \tag{5}\]

where \(N_{b}^{t}\) is number of the tagged \(b\)-jets and \(N_{b}^{e}\) is the number of labelled \(b\)-jets with at least one electron with \(p_{T}>2\) GeV/c after _good quality_ cuts.

The jet rejection factor is calculated as following:

\[R_{jet}=\frac{N_{j}}{N_{j}^{t}}, \tag{6}\]

where \(j\) is a given jet type (\(u\),\(c\)), \(N_{j}\) is the number of labelled jets of type \(j\) in the \(H\to j\bar{j}\) sample with at least one, _good quality_ track with \(p_{T}>2\) GeV/c inside the jet cone, and \(N_{j}^{t}\) is the number of labelled \(j\)-type jets tagged as \(b\)-jets.

### Results for b-tagging

Jets are reconstructed with the standard cone algorithm and labelled as originating from a \(b\)-quark, if a quark with \(p_{T}^{b}>5\) GeV/c (after FSR) is found in a cone \(\Delta R=\sqrt{\left[\Delta\eta(e,b)\right]^{2}+\left[\Delta\phi(e,b)\right]^{2} }<0.2\) around the jet direction. The labeling for \(c-\) and \(u-\)jets is done in the same way. For more details on jets kinematics see appendix B.

Fig. 10 shows the rejection factors for various types of jets as a function of the \(b\)-tagging algorithm efficiency. The achieved rejection factors for non-\(b\) jets are presented in Tab. 6 and compared with the TDR samples performance.

The fraction of reconstructed \(b\)-jets with an electron track within a cone \(\Delta R\leq 0.4\) around the jet axis is defined as the effective branching ratio \(BR\) and depends on the performance of the detector. This value is normalised to the total number of reconstructed \(b\)-labelled jets, with at least one _good quality_ tracks with \(p_{T}>2\) GeV/c inside the jet cone. For the sample of \(H\to b\overline{b}\), this fraction is \(BR\sim 13\%\). The soft-electron b-tagging efficiency, \(\varepsilon_{b}^{soft}\), can be calculated by multiplying the efficiency of the \(b-\)tagging algorithm, \(\varepsilon_{b}^{alg}\), by the obtained branching ratio \(BR\). Thus, 60% efficiency of the \(b\)-tagging algorithm with \(p_{T}^{track}>2\) GeV/c, corresponds to \(\varepsilon_{b}^{soft}\sim 7.8\%\).

Figure 10: _Jet rejection factors \(R_{jet}\) as a function of the \(b\)-tagging algorithm efficiency, \(\varepsilon_{b}^{alg}\), for various types of jets, for TDR samples (full circles) and DC1 samples (open squares)._Tab. 7 shows the fraction of jets tagged by a given type of track for \(\varepsilon_{b}^{alg}~{}=~{}60\%\). Most of the jets are tagged by true electron tracks, independently of the jet type. It indicates, that the electron identification procedure works with a high efficiency and good purity. Most of the electron tracks which tag jets, except for \(u\)-jets, are signal electron tracks (from \(b\)- or \(d\)-hadron decays). For the \(b\)-jet sample, these tracks tag 87.6% of all tagged jets. The sample of \(u\)-jets almost does not contain electrons from \(b\) and \(d\), but these jets are tagged, in 72.2%, by the electron tracks from \(\gamma\)-conversions and Dalitz decays.

Apart electrons from conversions pions become a major source of background. This is due to the worse pion rejection in DC1 data.

As can be noticed from Tab. 7, 72.2% of \(u\)-jets are tagged by electrons from \(\gamma\) conversions and Dalitz decays. Thus, using the conversion package can improve the jet rejection. In Fig. 11 rejections of \(u\)-jets and \(c\)-jets are presented with and without use of the conversion package. For \(\varepsilon_{b}^{alg}\)=60% the rejection of \(u\)-jets increased from 98 to 128 after use information from conversion finding package. Rejection of \(c\)-jets, as they are tagged mostly by signal electrons, stays almost not changed.

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|} \hline  & DC1 & TDR \\ \hline \(\varepsilon_{b}^{alg}\) [\%] & 60 & 60 \\ \hline \(R_{u}\) & \(98\pm 8\) & \(117\pm 10\) \\ \hline \(R_{c}\) & \(29\pm 2\) & \(25\pm 1\) \\ \hline \end{tabular}

## 5 Conclusion

In this note the soft electron identification and \(b\)-tagging results obtained are presented. A new algorithm dedicated to the reconstruction of soft electrons, softeBuilder, is used. It is implemented in the Athena framework in the Reconstruction/gammaRec package since release 7.8.0.

The performance is detailed on samples \(H\to j\overline{j}\) (where \(j\) stands for \(b\), \(c\) and \(u\) quarks) produced during the ATLAS Data Challenge 1. Due to changes in the geometry layout and running conditions, performance is slightly worse than in previous studies done with TDR data in the Atrecon framework. The origins of differences are explained.

The implemented algorithm was kept as close as possible to the one used in the previous studies. This allows to validate this first implementation in Athena. Further systematic studies are foreseen such as optimisation in \(p_{T}\) bins (high statistics needed), cut on electronic noise, the use of other geometry layouts (initial and final), take into account of pileup, the comparison between DC1 and DC2 results, as well as optimisation of the discriminating variables.

This algorithm will also be used on the combined test beam data, in order to check

Figure 11: _Jet rejection factor \(R_{jet}\) as a function of the \(b\)-tagging algorithm efficiency, \(\varepsilon_{b}^{alg}\), for various types of jets with (open squares) and without (full circles) use of the conversion finding algorithm for DC1 samples._for example the agreement of the shower shapes in Monte Carlo and data.

Identification procedure has to evolve from PAW framework to an Athena based one. Also, a dedicated soft electron \(b\)-tagging algorithm has to be implemented. This will allow easy combination of the different \(b\)-tagging methods.

Impact of the transverse impact parameter

The rejections obtained for pions in various samples without using \(A_{0}\) variable are presented in Tab. 8.

Including \(A_{0}\) is not important for \(H\to b\bar{b}\) sample. For \(\varepsilon_{e}=80\%\) the rejection of pion tracks is \(135\pm 5\) with and \(132\pm 5\) without that variable. On the contrary for lighter jets this variable is crucial. Rejections increase by factor \(\sim 2\), going from \(128\pm 5\) to \(335\pm 23\) for \(H\to u\bar{u}\) and \(143\pm 8\) to \(260\pm 21\) for \(H\to c\bar{c}\).

As can be seen from Fig. 12 the transverse impact parameter is the main source of the differences in the pion rejection between DC1 and TDR data in \(H\to u\bar{u}\) samples. In \(H\to b\bar{b}\) and \(H\to c\bar{c}\) the impact of \(A_{0}\) is obviously not so significant. Then, the differences in other variables between TDR and DC1 are important as is shown in Fig 5.

## Appendix B Jets kinematics

Tab. 9 shows the mean transverse momentum of the labelled jets, \(<p_{T}^{j}>\), with at least one reconstructed track with \(p_{T}>2\) GeV/c inside a cone \(\Delta R<0.4\) around the jet axis and the mean multiplicity of _good quality_ tracks with \(p_{T}>2\) GeV/c inside the jet cone.

Tab. 10 shows the average values of the transverse momenta of electrons (from all mentioned sources) and of hadrons in various jets. A threshold on \(p_{T}^{track}>2\) GeV/c is used and only tracks inside a cone \(\Delta R\leq 0.4\) around a jet axis and after _good quality_ cuts are considered. Particles inside reconstructed jets have rather low transverse momenta, an average between \(7-10\) GeV/c.

The fraction of reconstructed jets containing electron tracks with \(p_{T}>2\) GeV/c and within the cone \(\Delta R<0.4\) from the jet axis is given in Tab. 11 for all types of jets.

The dominant source of electrons in the signal jets (\(b\)-jets) are electrons from semileptonic decays of \(b\)-hadrons (\(b\to e\)) and \(d\)-hadrons (\(b\to c\to e\)). The semileptonic decays of \(d\)-hadrons (\(c\to e\)) occur frequently in \(c\)-jets. The \(u\)-jets are almost free from signal electrons. The contamination of \(u\)-jets with electrons from heavy-flavour quarks from initial-state-radiation gluon splitting is below one per mil.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|} \hline Jet type & \multicolumn{2}{c|}{\(<p_{T}>\)} & [GeV/c] \\ \cline{2-3}  & electrons & hadrons \\ \hline \(b\)-jets & 10.2 & 7.1 \\ \hline \(c\)-jets & 7.9 & 8.3 \\ \hline \(u\)-jets & 7.3 & 9.7 \\ \hline \end{tabular}

Numbers are given for tracks in a cone \(\Delta R<0.4\) around the jet axis and with a transverse momentum \(p_{T}>2\) GeV/c._In \(u\)-jets the main sources of electrons are \(\gamma\)-conversions and Dalitz decays.

The presence of any electron in the background jets makes their rejection difficult (as the method uses electrons as tagging particles). As can be concluded from Tab. 11 the best rejection factor can be achieved for \(u\)-jets and the worst for \(c\)-jets.

The fraction of electrons from conversions becomes substantial at large rapidity and large transverse momenta. Such an enhancement in population of electrons from conversions happens both in the signal and background jets, just making the rejection of background jets more difficult.
