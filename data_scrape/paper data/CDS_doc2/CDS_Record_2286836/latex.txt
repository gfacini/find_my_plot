## 1 Introduction

Previous studies have shown that the Beam Induced Backgrounds (BIB) in the LHC experiments originate from three different beam loss processes [1, 2]:

1. Local inelastic beam-gas scattering in the interaction region (IR). Simulations indicate that events as far as \(\sim\)500 m upstream of the interaction point (IP) contribute to the background in the experiments.
2. Proton halo lost on the tertiary collimators (TCT) \(\sim\)150 m upstream of the IP.
3. Elastic beam-gas scattering around the LHC ring. These protons are mostly intercepted by the primary and secondary collimators located in dedicated beam-cleaning insertions. A small fraction reach the TCTs where they add to the rate from tertiary halo losses.

The analysis of LHC Run-1 BIB data [3, 4] in ATLAS [5] has established that the BIB seen by the ATLAS Beam Conditions Monitor (BCM) [6] has a strong correlation with the residual pressure measured in the beam pipe \(\pm\)22 m from the IP. While this correlation suggested that other contributions should be small, it was not possible to quantify exactly how important the other two background components are, in particular those related to tertiary beam halo.

Beam background data recorded during the special \(\beta^{*}\)=1000 m fills in 2012 revealed that beam losses in the cleaning insertions can be seen as increased backgrounds in ATLAS, provided they temporarily reach levels which dominate over the beam-gas contribution. The magnitude of those halo-related backgrounds was clearly correlated with the bunch intensity loss [4]. Although these observations were for very special settings, the result triggered the idea that similar correlations could be established also in normal optics, provided the beam conditions are very clean and losses large enough. Such conditions can be found in dedicated loss-map measurements at the LHC, when the beam intensity, and thereby the residual pressure in the vacuum pipe, is much lower than in normal physics operation.

During 2015 the possibility of reducing \(\beta^{*}\) was presented [7]. But this requires a reduction of the aperture of the TCTs, which is bound to lead to increased halo losses only 150 m upstream of the experiments. With this prospect of a significant luminosity increase, a quantification of the tertiary halo contributions to the experimental backgrounds gained in importance.

In 2015 ATLAS took data during two loss-map fills, dedicated to studying the beam cleaning with reduced \(\beta^{*}\). Loss-maps are a standard part of the machine protection validation of the LHC, used to ensure that the collimation system properly protects the machine aperture. They consist of exciting controlled beam losses from single bunches, while monitoring the loss distribution around the ring. In this note the results for optics corresponding to normal 2015 operation at \(\beta^{*}\)=80 cm and for a reduced setting of \(\beta^{*}\)=40 cm are presented. In the latter case also the dependence of the background on the aperture of the tertiary collimator was explored. The background seen by the BCM and the rate of fake jets seen in the calorimeters are quantified in terms of measured beam losses at the primary and tertiary collimators, but also in terms of the number of protons lost from the beam.

Since the loss map tests provide essentially pure halo-related BIB, the data yield themselves to a comparison with Monte Carlo (MC) simulations. These were done with the Sixtrack[8] code to determine the loss pattern around the ring and the Fluka[9, 10] code for proton interactions and shower transport. The results are compared with data on an absolute scale, i.e. without any data/MC normalisation.

## 2 BIB monitoring methods in ATLAS

The principal triggers for beam background monitoring in ATLAS are provided by the BCM detector and by a low-\(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) jet trigger based on energy deposition in the calorimeters.

The BCM detector consists of 4 diamond modules of \(8\times 8\,\mathrm{mm}^{2}\) active area on each side of the IP at z=184 cm. They are arranged in a cross, two modules in the vertical and two in the horizontal plane at a mean radius of 5.5 cm from the beam line. The BCM provides one background trigger for each beam, which are labelled L1_BCM_AC and L1_BCM_CA for beam-1 and beam-2, respectively1. The trigger signature is formed by a background-like coincidence of hits in the upstream and downstream BCM modules. With respect to the passage of the bunch centre at the IP, the upstream hit must be observed 6.25 \(\pm\) 2.73 ns earlier and the downstream hit 6.25 \(\pm\) 2.73 ns later in order to fire the trigger.

Footnote 1: In the right-handed ATLAS coordinate system, with its origin at the nominal IP, the azimuthal angle \(\phi\) is measured with respect to the \(x\)-axis, which points towards the centre of the LHC ring. Side A of ATLAS is defined as the side of the incoming clockwise LHC beam-1, while the side of the incoming beam-2 is labelled C. The \(z\)-axis in the ATLAS coordinate system points from C to A, i.e. along the beam-2 direction. The pseudorapidity is defined as \(\eta=-\ln\tan(\theta/2)\), where \(\theta\) is the polar angle with respect to the \(z\)-axis.

The ATLAS barrel calorimeter system consists of a high-granularity liquid-argon (LAr) electromagnetic calorimeter with lead as absorber and a scintillator-tile (TileCal) hadronic calorimeter. These cover pseudorapidities up to \(|\eta|=1.5\) and \(|\eta|=1.7\), respectively. In terms of radius the barrel LAr extends from r=1.5 m to r=2.0 m and the TileCal from r=2.3 m to r=4.3 m. In the endcap region the calorimetry is extended by the hadronic endcaps (HEC), based on LAr technology, to cover a range \(1.5<|\eta|<3.2\). These calorimeters provide the L1_J12 trigger, which is used for BIB monitoring. This trigger fires on a transverse energy deposition above 12 GeV, calibrated at approximately the electromagnetic scale, in an \(\eta-\phi\) region with a width of about \(\Delta\eta\times\Delta\phi=0.8\times 0.8\) anywhere within \(|\eta|<3.0\) and, with reduced efficiency, up to \(|\eta|=3.2\).

While the BCM trigger probes directly showers created by beam losses and developing just outside the beam pipe, the calorimeter trigger, in non-collision events, will almost exclusively pick up fake jets due to radiative energy losses of high energy muons traversing the calorimeter material. Besides cosmic rays, these muons originate from beam losses far upstream. Since the muons emerging from interactions of 6.5 TeV protons with residual gas or aperture restrictions have a strong forward boost they will not reach the radial range of the calorimeters, unless they are produced at a large distance or deflected by the magnets of the LHC lattice. Therefore the BCM and jet triggers are to a large extent complementary. The results of this note will also be used to study the correlations of these two triggers in the case of essentially pure beam halo losses.

## 3 Beam conditions and cleaning

Due to limitations imposed by machine protection requirements the total intensity during the loss-map tests had to be kept below \(3\times 10^{11}\) protons, which allowed for one nominal bunch with an intensity of about 1.3\(\times 10^{11}\) protons and up to 30 pilot bunches with a typical intensity of \(5-10\times 10^{9}\) protons, each. Alternatively two nominal bunches and just a few pilot bunches could be used. The bunches are identified by their Bunch Crossing Identifier (BCID), which is defined as

\[\mathrm{BCID}=\mathrm{Bucket}_{\mathrm{RF}}/10+1,\]where BuckteRf is the number of the LHC radio-frequency bucket.

In low-\(\beta^{*}\) optics the background seen by the experiments originates from beam-gas interactions or from proton halo being lost on the TCT. The residual pressure in the beam pipe during a normal physics fill is mostly due to photon- and particle-induced molecule desorption from the pipe wall. Since the beam intensity was very low in the loss-map fills the beam-related dynamic pressure component was negligible. At the same time the halo losses during the short excitations were orders of magnitude above normal levels, providing conditions where the background was almost exclusively due to halo losses.

The loss maps were created by keeping collimators at stable positions, while exciting individual bunches with the transverse damper system of the LHC. The method is described in Refs. [11; 12].

When a white-noise excitation is applied to the beam with the transverse damper, the betatron amplitudes of the affected particles increase so that losses occur in the betatron cleaning insertion IR7 [13; 14]. Excitations were applied sequentially to one bunch at a time for a typical duration of a few seconds. A pilot bunch with an initial intensity of 5\(\times\)10\({}^{9}\) protons could sustain 2-3 excitations, while a nominal bunch could be excited more often before its intensity was exhausted. The losses at the primary collimators (TCP) are monitored with beam loss monitors (BLM) [15; 16] in the vicinity of the collimators.

The source of the halo-related background reaching ATLAS is the TCT system, located in the incoming-beam line about 150m upstream of the IP. The TCTs intercept some of the proton halo that leaks out from the betatron- and/or momentum-cleaning insertions in IR7 and IR3, respectively. Separate TCTs are installed for the horizontal and the vertical halo. Like the TCPs, the TCTs are outfitted with BLMs, but due to different geometry and shower development the BLM readings from TCP and TCT regions cannot be simply compared in order to determine the ratio of proton losses at these two locations. In general, a given BLM is very suitable for monitoring local losses as a function of time, but the comparison of BLM readings from two different locations would have to rely on detailed shower simulations of the BLMs, which suffer from significant uncertainties [12].

The losses at the TCTs are several orders of magnitude smaller than at the TCPs and, as will be seen, at the largest TCT openings the signal is almost lost in the noise of the BLMs.

Table 1 lists the collimator settings during both loss map tests. It should be noted that the aperture is not the only parameter defining where particles will be intercepted. The phase advance with respect to upstream collimators also plays a role; a particle at its minimum orbit excursion might pass a tight collimator, but be intercepted by a wider aperture where its transverse displacement happens to be larger.

The test at \(\beta^{*}\)=80 cm took place in fill 3957, which had four pilot bunches and two nominal bunches per beam. One pair of nominal bunches was colliding in IR1 and IR5. The TCT was kept at 13.7 \(\sigma\), which corresponds to the standard operational setting in 2015. The test at \(\beta^{*}=40\) cm was performed in LHC fill 4283 with one nominal bunch and 15 pilot bunches per beam and no collisions. During this test the TCT aperture was increased from an initial 7.8 \(\sigma\) to 10.3 \(\sigma\) in steps of 0.5 \(\sigma\). At each setting excitations were applied to one or two of the bunches. All excitations of the nominal bunches were done with a TCT setting of 8.8 \(\sigma\), close to the foreseen operational value2. The intensities of the bunches for which losses were provoked in these two tests are listed in Table 2.

Bunches in BCIDs 2551 and 2498 are pilots with a very small intensity loss but are included here in order to give an indication of the excitation in the other plane. The unit of the \(\sum_{\rm X}\) values is somewhat arbitrary, as will be explained in Section 4.

is passing in inverse alphabetical order, i.e. from 'D' to 'A'. Each location has its own dedicated BLM, but due to shower development there is significant cross-talk so the BLMs are not able to unambiguously distinguish losses on a particular TCP. The second column in Table 3 indicates the orientation of the collimator, i.e. in which plane the beams are scraped. The last four lines of the table list the response of each BLM normalised to the intensity loss. This ratio is about 0.2 for the BLM associated to the collimator in the plane of the excitation. However, for horizontal excitations the signal in the vertical BLM-D is negligible, while for vertical excitations BLM-C and BLM-D see a signal due to cross-talk. In fact, even for vertical excitations, BLM-C sees a larger signal than BLM-D, which implies that the initiated shower is more intense further downstream. BLM-B, associated to a skew collimator, and BLM-A in an empty slot give rather consistent signal/loss ratios irrespective of the initial plane of excitation and are therefore adopted as the best reference to measure the losses. For BLM-B the signal/loss is about 0.5, while for BLM-A it is 0.9. Only bunch 2498 of beam-2 appears to be somewhat an outlier, giving slightly lower ratios. For this study only BLM-A has been used, since it has the largest signal and, therefore, the best statistics.

Another potential source of bias between horizontal and vertical excitations comes from the TCTs: since the vertical TCT is downstream of the horizontal, the BLM associated to it has some sensitivity to losses on the horizontal TCT, but not vice-versa. Therefore two BLMs can get signals from losses on the horizontal TCT, but only one BLM from those on the vertical. It turns out, however, that the original plane of excitation has only minor influence on which TCT the tertiary halo is lost on. Therefore the sum of the BLMs associated to the two TCTs is systematically used as a measure of the losses on the TCTs.

The analysis of 2012 beam backgrounds established that the background trigger rate seen by the BCM detector is strongly correlated with the pressure at \(|z|\approx\)22 m [4]. Unfortunately several of the gauges in that region were found to misbehave throughout 2015 operation. The only pair of gauges giving reasonable values for both beams were the VGBP_222 Penning gauges. During the tests these measured a residual pressure of about \(10^{-10}\) mbar, although the values were suspiciously constant throughout the fill, suggesting that the pressure might have been below the sensitivity of the devices. In a normal physics fill of 2015 the pressure indicated by the VGPB_222 gauges was around 7\(\times 10^{-10}\) mbar and the observed BCM background rate was few Hz per \(10^{11}\) protons.

Although the correlation of BCM background with the pressure at 22 m is less evident in 2015 data than in Run-1, the pressure readings suggest that during the loss map tests the BCM background from beam-gas events was of the order of 0.5 Hz per \(10^{11}\) protons. Another estimate of this rate will later be derived from the data recorded between the excitation peaks.

Fake jets in calorimeters are mostly due to muons from distant beam-gas events. The gauges close to the arc, i.e. at about 250 m from the IP, indicated about 20 times lower pressure during the loss map tests than in a normal physics fill. This suggests that the beam-gas contribution to the fake-jet rate during the loss map tests is at least an order of magnitude lower than in normal physics fills, i.e. at a level of a few mHz per \(10^{11}\) protons.

## 4 Analysis methodology

### Peak finding

The relevant BLM data for the entire fills are extracted from the LHC logging database. The BLMs are ionisation chambers placed on the sides of the LHC beam line elements where they measure the dose due to local beam losses. The basic measurement of a BLM is the maximum value in a 43 \(\mu\)s time slice. From these values running sums over different time spans are constructed [18]. The unit is always Gy/s, i.e. there is no absolute normalisation to the number of protons lost. For this analysis the 1.3 s running sum of the BLM signal is used. It is stored in the database every second, which is sufficient to determine the integrated loss over an excitation lasting a few seconds. The value actually stored is the largest running sum that appeared over the last second, which means that the values in two consecutive bins can contain up to 75% the same readings. Thus a sum over all bins does not give the exact integral loss. Also the unit of such a time integral is somewhat arbitrary, as it is not exactly Gy, but a sum of 1.3 s samples taken at 1 Hz.

As can be seen in Figure 1 the peaks in the BLMs of IR7 are very pronounced and clearly distinguished from the background even for the low-intensity pilot bunches. A simple algorithm is sufficient to find the peaks and identify their rising and falling edges: a suitable threshold is defined by eye and the start of the peak is defined as the bin when the value exceeds this threshold. The end is defined when the value falls below the threshold. The integral under the peak is computed as the sum of the readings between these limits, and the time at the centre of the peak as the average of the limits. The time periods when the excitation was applied to a given bunch is known with one-second accuracy. The average time of the peaks is used to match them to these excitations and to unambiguously assign each peak to a given bunch.

Except for the most intense loss-spikes, the losses in normal \(\beta^{*}\)=80 cm optics at the TCTs are so small that the corresponding BLM signal is barely above noise level. The losses on the TCPs are several orders of magnitude larger and result in much better signal/noise ratio of the BLMs. Thus the peaks in the BLM signal, corresponding to the beam losses, can be reliably determined in the TCPBLM$s, but not directly from the TCTBLM$s. Therefore the TCTBLM signal has been extracted as the integral between the peak limits determined from the TCPBLM$s.

This method is illustrated, for the \(\beta^{*}\)=80 cm fills, in Figures 2 and 3 for the consecutive excitations of the nominal bunches in beam-1 and beam-2, respectively. From the figures it is evident that an accurate determination and subtraction of the pedestal is essential in order to obtain a reliable signal estimate for the TCTBLM$s. For this, the pedestal in the TCTBLM has been fitted over regions where no losses are seen on the TCPs. A natural assumption would be that after the beam-dump, at \(\sim\)10:22:40 UTC, the cleanest - and lowest - pedestal should be obtained. Surprisingly this is not always the case; as shown by the two horizontal lines in the middle plot of Figure 3 the pedestal level for beam-2 in the horizontal TCTHBLM is higher after the beam dump than just before. The difference is significant for the signal estimate and the lower pedestal, fitted over 100 s starting at 10:21 UTC, has been used. For beam-1 a much more consistent pedestal estimate is found for different regions of the fit.

The background events are recorded with time-stamps of nanosecond accuracy, which assign them to a specific bunch crossing. Since, however, the data in the LHC logging database might have small time-shifts due to the 1 Hz recording and 1.3 s integration times, the peaks determined from the TCPBLM-adata are broadened by 2 seconds on both sides before counting the events falling into the extended peak areas.

Another important ingredient in the analysis is the intensity of each individual bunch. These are recorded in the ATLAS database, but only with a time-resolution of one ATLAS luminosity block (LB), with a typical length of 60 seconds. This coarse time resolution is not an issue for the Background/\(\Delta I\) analysis,

Figure 1: Determination of loss peaks for some beam-1 pilot bunches and their assignment to ATLAS luminosity blocks (LB). The limits of the ATLAS LBs are indicated by the dotted lines and their numbers run on top of the figure. The blue (red) arrows at the bottom indicate the time of an excitation of a beam-1 (beam-2) bunch and the numbers below the arrows show the BCID of the excited bunch. The horizontal line at \(10^{-5}\) indicates the threshold set for peak finding and the shaded areas show the width over which the peaks are integrated. The excitations of beam-2 bunch 455 do not give visible signals in the beam-1 TCT\({}_{\rm BLM}\).

since \(\Delta I=I_{\rm before}-I_{\rm after}\) and the intensity does not vary rapidly outside the excitation peaks. It has, however, a minor influence on the intensity-dependent pedestal correction. But, as will be shown, this correction itself is of the order of 10%, and the effect of the coarse resolution is a small fraction of this.

### Uncertainty estimates

The BLM data are available only in terms of instantaneous dose rates, rather than hit counts. Thus there is no obvious way to determine the uncertainty due to counting statistics in the BLMs. However, since

Figure 2: The beam-1 loss peaks measured by BLMs at the primary and tertiary collimators during the \(\beta^{*}\)=80 cm loss map fill. All peaks correspond to consecutive excitations of the nominal bunch in BCID 1786. The shaded areas indicate the time intervals over which the peaks at the TCP\({}_{\rm BLM}\) have been fitted. The same intervals are used to extract the peaks from the TCT\({}_{\rm BLM}\)s. In the two lower plots the dotted horizontal line indicates the fitted background level.

the BLM data are recorded with 1 s binning, whereas an excitation typically lasts 10 s, it is possible to estimate the uncertainty of the \(\mathrm{TCT_{BLM}}/\mathrm{TCP_{BLM}}\) ratio in each peak by calculating that quantity for each time bin separately and determining the average of these per-bin ratios and its error. This method covers the counting statistics and other effects that might alter the ratio during the peak. But it will not take into account possible changes, like orbit drifts, that take place between different peaks.

Unfortunately it turned out that a similar method cannot be applied to the \(\mathrm{Background}/\mathrm{TCP_{BLM}}\) ratio. Close inspection of the sub-structure of the peaks revealed differences that suggested time shifts of the order of 1-2 seconds between the ATLAS background data and the BLM data in the LHC database. As

All peaks correspond to consecutive excitations of the nominal bunch in BCID 892. The shaded areas indicate the time-intervals over which the peaks at the \(\mathrm{TCP_{BLM}}\) have been fitted. The same intervals are used to extract the peaks from the \(\mathrm{TCT_{BLM}}\). In the two lower plots the dotted horizontal lines indicate the background levels from two different fits explained in the text. The large spike at \(\sim\)10:22:40 is caused by a beam dump.

explained before, these shifts arise from the 1.3 s integration time and 1 Hz recording frequency. Since these shifts were not systematically in the same direction for all peaks and in some cases not even within a peak, a corrective shift to properly match the data at the sub-second level was not feasible. The Background\(/\)TCP\({}_{\text{BLM}}\) (and Background\(/\)TCT\({}_{\text{BLM}}\)) ratios have been calculated based on the peak integrals and the uncertainty is estimated from the background counting statistics alone. For the Background\(/\)TCP\({}_{\text{BLM}}\) ratio this should cover the dominant uncertainty. For the Background\(/\)TCT\({}_{\text{BLM}}\) ratio this procedure certainly underestimates the error because the TCT\({}_{\text{BLM}}\) signal is barely above the pedestal and surely dominates the uncertainty.

## 5 Results

Most of the intensity losses following the excitation of a given bunch take place at the IR7 TCPs. The secondary halo is intercepted locally by the TCSs and absorbers, but a small fraction leaks out from IR7 and can end up on the TCTs close to the experiments. It is expected that for a given beam and plane of excitation the ratio between protons lost on the TCT and on the TCP would be the same for all bunches.

Figure 4 summarises the observed signals and the changes of the bunch intensity during the excitations of the nominal beam-1 bunch at \(\beta^{*}\)=40 cm. The TCP\({}_{\text{BLM}}\) signal peaks are very clearly above the noise level for all eight consecutive excitations of the bunch and the time-range of the peaks can be reliably determined by the method described in Section 4.1. All peaks are very prominent, so a background subtraction is not needed.

The signals from the TCT\({}_{\text{BLM}}\)s are much smaller and for the first excitations, around 5:06 UTC, they are not distinguishable from the background. The same is true for the BCM background counts. In both cases a noise subtraction is mandatory, especially for the first excitations which result in very small losses. The low level of the losses is also reflected in the bunch intensity which shows hardly any change over the first four excitations. The three excitations between 5:10 UTC and 5:12 UTC give clear signals both in the TCT\({}_{\text{BLM}}\)s and in the BCM and are associated with an intensity loss totalling about 10\({}^{10}\) protons.

The last excitation, starting at 5:13 UTC, lasts for about 30 s during which 3\(\times\)10\({}^{10}\) protons are lost from the bunch and a prominent background signal, with about 3500 counts in the BCM, is observed.

### Tertiary/primary ratios

The TCT\({}_{\text{BLM}}\)/TCP\({}_{\text{BLM-A}}\) ratios during the loss map test at \(\beta^{*}\)=40 cm are plotted as a function of wall-clock time in Figure 5 where the TCT settings are indicated by the vertical lines. In Figure 5 the peaks shown in Figure 4 are seen as a group of points in the rightmost column. The large uncertainties due to the almost non-existing TCT\({}_{\text{BLM}}\) signals in the first points are reflected as large error bars. Surprisingly the excitations 5-6 of that bunch, despite having clear signals in Figure 4 have substantial error bars and, what is more significant, points 5-8 exhibit an unexpected trend with time. A comparison with the excitations of the pilot bunch (at about 4:17 UTC) with the TCT at 8.8 \(\sigma\) reveals that only the last excitation of the nominal bunch is consistent with them. This excess of the TCT\({}_{\text{BLM}}\)/TCP\({}_{\text{BLM-A}}\) ratio for the excitations 1-7 of the nominal bunch is not understood, but the systematic trend during the last four excitations suggests that the properties of the bunch either change with the successive excitations and halo cleaning or that there is an orbit drift affecting the halo leakage from IR7 to IR1. After careful investigation of these data-points it was found that due to their large uncertainties, compared to the last point, they have a negligible effect on the analysis, but confuse the data-plots. Therefore it was decided to suppress them.

Figure 5(b) shows the corresponding plot for beam-2 excitations and consistent trends can be seen for all excitations. Also the ratios from all three consecutive excitations of the nominal bunch agree mutually as well as with the corresponding pilot bunch excitations.

Figure 4: The uppermost plot shows the signals observed in the BLM (TCP slot A) in IR7 during the eight consecutive excitations of the nominal beam-1 bunch (BCID 1) at \(\beta^{*}\)=40 cm with the TCT at \(8.8\,\sigma\). The second plot from above shows the corresponding signals in the IR1 TCT\({}_{\mathrm{BLM}}\) (sum of TCT\({}_{\mathrm{BLM}}\) and TCT\({}_{\mathrm{BLM}}\)). The third plot shows the observed BCM background and the lowest plot the intensity of the affected bunch. The shaded areas indicate the peak ranges determined from the upper plot which are used to extract the signal in the two middle plots. The dotted vertical lines indicate ATLAS luminosity block boundaries and their numbering is given at the top of the plots. The bunch intensity, shown in the lowest plot, is obtained from the ATLAS database, where it is available only as an average over the duration of an ATLAS luminosity block.

Figure 6 shows the \(\mathrm{TCT_{BLM}}/\mathrm{TCP_{BLM-A}}\) ratio as a function of the opening of the TCT. The results of both the \(\beta^{*}\)=40 cm and \(\beta^{*}\)=80 cm fills are included. Due to the small losses on the TCT the data at \(\beta^{*}\)=80 cm have large statistical uncertainties. This motivated to average all the \(\beta^{*}\)=80 cm data in order to obtain only one point per plane of excitation, but with much smaller uncertainties. However, pilots and nominal bunches are treated separately. The fits correspond to exponentials of the form \(Ae^{bx}\) where \(x\) is the TCT aperture expressed in number of nominal single-beam width (\(\sigma\)). As expected, the \(\mathrm{TCT_{BLM}}/\mathrm{TCP_{BLM-A}}\) ratio decreases with increasing TCT aperture, as the wider open TCT intercepts less of the tertiary halo.

In general the \(\beta^{*}\)=40 cm data are fitted well by an exponential, but the extrapolation to 13.7 sigma does not go through the \(\beta^{*}\)=80 cm data-points. For beam-1 a significant overshoot is observed especially when the excitation is in the vertical plane, while for beam-2 the extrapolations pass slightly below the \(\beta^{*}\)=80 cm data-points. This slight undershoot might be caused by a 0.5 \(\sigma\) tighter TCS setting at \(\beta^{*}\)=40 cm, which should reduce the halo leakage from IR7. But the overshoot in beam-1 goes in the opposite direction, i.e. must have a different origin.

For beam-1 the slopes of the \(\mathrm{TCT_{BLM}}/\mathrm{TCP_{BLM-A}}\) ratio as a function of TCT setting exhibit substantial differences between horizontal and vertical excitations. While the fit to the horizontal excitations has a relatively moderate overshoot with respect to the point at 13.7 \(\sigma\), the fit to the vertical excitations has a much gentler slope and a larger overshoot. The first five vertical excitation data points are obtained using the bunch in BCID 3052. All points are found to have well distinguishable loss-peaks with small uncertainties in the \(\mathrm{TCT_{BLM}}\)s, so there is no objective reason to exclude any of them. The reason for this strange behaviour of bunch 3052 is not known, but it seems to be another indication that the results

Figure 5: Ratio of signals from IR1 \(\mathrm{TCT_{BLM}}\) to IR7 \(\mathrm{TCP_{BLM-A}}\) as a function of wall-clock time during the loss map tests at \(\beta^{*}\)=40 cm. For IR7 the BLM in location A has been used, which has sensitivity to all losses. For IR1 the sum of the BLMs close to the horizontal and vertical TCTs has been used. The vertical columns correspond to a given TCT aperture, indicated at the top of each column in units of the nominal beam width \(\sigma\). For both beams the test starts with a series of excitations of several pilot bunches while opening the TCT in steps. These are followed by repeated excitations of the nominal bunch with the TCT fixed at 8.8 \(\sigma\).

can depend on some properties of an individual bunch: while the first excitation gives a ratio that would be consistent with a steeper slope, as seen for the other cases, the next four excitations indicate a lower tertiary halo intensity (or different distribution on the TCT).

### BCM-background/TCT\({}_{\text{BLM}}\)-loss ratios

In Figure 7 the ratio of the BCM background with respect to the losses on the TCTs is shown as a function of the TCT aperture for the two beams and planes of excitation. If the background rate results exclusively from the loss rate on the TCT, then the ratio between the background trigger rate and the loss rate seen by the TCT\({}_{\text{BLM}}\)s should be constant3. Motivated by this hypothesis, the data at \(\beta^{*}\)=40 cm are fitted with a constant, as indicated on the plots. The \(\chi^{2}/\text{ndf}\) of the fits are in the range 2-3, but, as explained before, the error bars on the points are underestimated since they take into account only the counting statistics in the BCM and not the uncertainty of the TCT\({}_{\text{BLM}}\) signal. This being taken into consideration, the data cannot be claimed to show any clear dependence on the TCT aperture. Three of the four fits indicate a ratio of about 7\(\times\)10\({}^{6}\), while the horizontal excitation of beam-1 gives a slightly lower ratio of about 4\(\times\)10\({}^{6}\). Figure 7 includes also the ratios observed at \(\beta^{*}\)=80 cm. They are less than a factor two above the \(\beta^{*}\)=40 cm fits for beam-2 but more significant deviations are found for beam-1: at \(\beta^{*}\)=80 cm the BCM-background\(/\)TCT\({}_{\text{BLM}}\) ratios are about four times higher than the average at \(\beta^{*}\)=40 cm. A priori there is

Figure 6: Ratio of signals from IR1 TCT\({}_{\text{BLM}}\) to IR7 TCP\({}_{\text{BLM-A}}\) as a function of TCT aperture. For IR7 the BLM in location A has been used, which has sensitivity to all losses. For IR1 the sum of the BLMs close to the horizontal and vertical TCTs has been taken. The points are slightly shifted horizontally with respect to each other to better separate the error bars, but for the fits they are all considered at their proper position as given in Section 3. The \(\beta^{*}\)=80 cm data points are the average of all excitations in the plane indicated. The fits shown do not take into account the \(\beta^{*}\)=80 cm data.

no reason to expect that the two optics settings would give the same ratio. A different impact-distribution on the TCT, both longitudinally and transversely, could very well affect the \(\mathrm{background/TCT_{BLM}}\) ratio because both the showering towards ATLAS and the response of the BLMs have a dependence on the impact distribution. Indeed, it is important to keep in mind that the value referred to as \(\mathrm{TCT_{BLM}}\) is actually the signal from the BLM, so it includes the efficiency of the BLM with respect to the loss. This efficiency is also important to keep in mind that the value referred to as \(\mathrm{TCT_{BLM}}\) is actually the signal from the BLM, so it is not the case for the BLM.

Figure 7: Ratio of BCM background to the signals from the IR1 \(\mathrm{TCT_{BLM}}\)s. Plots (a) and (b) show the results for the horizontal and vertical excitation of beam-1, respectively. The corresponding ratios for beam-2 horizontal and vertical excitations are shown in plots (c) and (d). Since the uncertainties of the BLM measurement could not be reliably estimated, the error bars consider only the counting statistics of the BCM.

has at least some dependence on the impact distribution of protons on the TCT. So a possible explanation for the deviation of the beam-1 \(\beta^{*}\)=80 cm data-points from the \(\beta^{*}\)=40 cm fits in Figures 6(a) and 7 is that at \(\beta^{*}\)=80 cm the efficiency of the BLM is reduced. Since the TCT\({}_{\mathrm{BLM}}\) signal is in the numerator in Figure 6(a) but in the denominator in Figure 7 a reduced response would be consistent with both figures. For beam-2 the deviations are in the same direction, so this explanation does not work. On the other hand, the deviations for beam-2 are much less significant and if the, presumably large, uncertainties of the TCT\({}_{\mathrm{BLM}}\) signal could be quantified and included, the beam-2 deviation might well be within the total uncertainties.

### Background/TCP\({}_{\mathrm{BLM}}\)-loss ratios

Figure 8 shows, as a function of the TCT aperture, the ratio between BCM background and beam loss at the primary collimators. Like in Figure 6 the data are fitted with exponentials of the form \(Ae^{bx}\). Since only the statistical errors of the trigger rates are considered, the uncertainties for the nominal bunches are much smaller than for the pilots. This means that the points for nominal bunches dominate the fit. Other uncertainties, which cannot be reliably estimated from the data, might have less dependence on the bunch intensity. In order to indicate how much the inclusion of the nominal bunch influences the fits, another fit is performed on each set of data, but excluding the nominal bunch: the difference is barely significant.

In most cases the fits to the \(\beta^{*}\)=40 cm data extrapolate rather close to the \(\beta^{*}\)=80 cm points, corresponding to a much wider TCT opening. Only the horizontal excitation of beam-2 shows a very significant offset between the extrapolated fit and the \(\beta^{*}\)=80 cm data-point. In this particular case the slope of the fit to the \(\beta^{*}\)=40 cm data is influenced by two consistent points at the tightest TCT opening of 7.8\(\sigma\). Due to these points, both from excitations of the bunch in BCID 455, the fitted slope is very steep and the extrapolation undershoots the \(\beta^{*}\)=80 cm value. An inspection of those two points, however, reveals no anomalies which would justify to exclude them from the fit. Since these points are the only two excitations of the bunch in BCID 455, it is possible that - again - this individual bunch shows a slightly deviating behaviour 4.

Footnote 4: An excess of these two points is not seen in Figure 9(c), but it is possible that BCM and fake-jet backgrounds also have a different dependence on the impact distribution on the TCT.

Figure 9 shows the corresponding ratios of fake-jet background and losses in IR7. The uncertainties of each point are much larger than for the BCM because the fake-jet rate is about 10% of the BCM background trigger rate. Within uncertainties, the \(\beta^{*}\)=40 cm and \(\beta^{*}\)=80 cm data are consistent with the same slope.

In order to fully benefit from the lever-arm provided by the 13.7 \(\sigma\) points a third fit, including all points, is performed in Figures 8 and 9. It should be noted, however, that this involves data with two different optics and slightly different settings of the TCS collimators.

It is interesting to note that in Figures 8 and 9 the fit on the \(\beta^{*}\)=40 cm data tends to undershoot the \(\beta^{*}\)=80 cm data-points for beam-2, while for beam-1 there is a slight tendency for an overshoot. While this is qualitatively consistent with Figure 6, it seems to contradict what could have been expected from Figure 7, where it is seen that at \(\beta^{*}\)=80 cm much more background is seen by the BCM per unit of TCT\({}_{\mathrm{BLM}}\) signal than at \(\beta^{*}\)=40 cm. As argued earlier, a possible explanation for the high \(\beta^{*}\)=80 cm point in Figure 7 is an underestimation of the number of protons actually lost on the TCT, caused by an impact-distribution dependence of the BLM efficiency.

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:17]

tightening the TCT the halo-related background increases by 65%. Thus, closing the TCT from 13.7\(\sigma\) to 8.8\(\sigma\) leads to an increase of this background component by a factor \(e^{0.5\times 5.1}\approx 13\).

The left and right plots show the ratio for horizontal and vertical excitations, respectively. The dashed red lines show the fits through all data taken at \(\beta^{*}\)=40 cm. The dotted black lines represent the fits to only the data from pilot bunches at \(\beta^{*}\)=40 cm. The solid blue lines show the fits when the data at \(\beta^{*}\)=80 cm are included.

### Background per unit intensity loss

Since losses in IR7 dominate the intensity loss of the excited bunches, a factor relating the observed background to the losses in IR7 can be derived from the drop of bunch intensity. This is illustrated in Figure 10, where the intensity of the nominal beam-1 bunch is shown together with the number of BCM background trigger counts. During the consecutive excitations the intensity of the bunch drops from 1.27\(\times\)10\({}^{11}\) protons to 0.17\(\times\)10\({}^{11}\) protons. The total number of BCM background triggers integrated over all excitations is 643. The average count rate prior to the excitation is 0.43\(\pm\)0.06 Hz, which after intensity normalisation corresponds to 0.34\(\pm\)0.05 Hz per 10\({}^{11}\) protons. Given the uncertainties in the pressure measurement, this value agrees well with the \(\sim 0.5\) Hz per 10\({}^{11}\) protons, that was estimated in Section 3 from the pressure difference with respect to a normal fill. During the excitation the beam intensity drops gradually and using 0.34 Hz per 10\({}^{11}\) protons as a scale, the average intensity corresponds to 78 counts from beam-gas events over the excitation period. If these are subtracted from the total of 643 counts, it is seen that a loss of 1.1\(\times\)10\({}^{11}\) protons results in 565 BCM background triggers. This corresponds to a rate of 5.1\(\times\)10\({}^{-9}\) triggers/proton.

The results for all those bunches where it was possible to unambiguously extract these quantities from the data are shown in Table 5. The values at \(\beta^{*}\)=80 cm are in the range of \((5-10)\times\)10\({}^{-9}\), which has interesting implications for operation at full beam intensity: a typical LHC fill in late 2015 had a beam lifetime of about 70 hours, a starting intensity of 1.1\(\times\)10\({}^{11}\) p/bunch and a fill average of 13.5 interactions per bunch crossing in ATLAS. These 13.5 interactions, taken for two high-luminosity experiments, imply a luminosity related loss of 3\(\times\)10\({}^{5}\) Hz/bunch. The total loss rate to reach 70 hours beam lifetime is 4.4\(\times\)10\({}^{5}\) Hz/bunch which has to include the 3\(\times\)10\({}^{5}\) Hz/bunch of luminosity burn-up, but also losses at the low luminosity experiments and due to beam-gas. Thus the average loss rate on the TCP has to be around or even below 10\({}^{5}\) Hz/bunch. Based on the \(\beta^{*}\)=80 cm values in Table 5 this average loss rate implies a halo-related contribution to the BCM background rate of only 0.5-1 mHz/bunch. The background observed during normal 2015 operation was at the level of 3-5 Hz/bunch which means that

The slopes are given for fits to all \(\beta^{*}\)=40 cm data and for all data, i.e. including the \(\beta^{*}\)=80 cm sample with a much wider TCT setting. The slopes of the fits including only the \(\beta^{*}\)=40 cm pilot bunches are not listed because they are very similar to the fits on all \(\beta^{*}\)=40 cm data.

the contribution of halo losses to the background seen by the ATLAS BCM was at the level of less than a per mil at \(\beta^{*}\)=80 cm.

In a similar manner also the J12 trigger rates per proton lost can be estimated and are listed in Table 6. Only the losses of the nominal bunches (1786 and 892) give enough J12 triggered events for a statistically significant estimate. The result for the beam-1 bunch in BCID 1786 is (\(5.7\pm 0.7\))\(\times 10^{-10}\), which for the normal operational loss of \(10^{5}\) Hz/bunch implies \(\sim\)0.05 mHz/bunch, corresponding to \(\sim 1\) per mil of the fake-jet rate observed during normal operation in 2015.

For both trigger rates, BCM and J12, the rate from beam-2 is higher by a factor of two at \(\beta^{*}\)=80 cm, but still remains a negligible contribution to the total background.

At \(\beta^{*}\)=40 cm the background per intensity loss values are higher by a more than an order of magnitude.

The uncertainties contain only the counting statistics in the BCM. \({}^{\dagger}\)BCID 3052 is excluded from average (see text).

Assuming that beam-gas contributions are independent of the TCT setting and \(\beta^{*}\) value6, the beam halo contributions to the total background would still remain at the percent level.

Footnote 6: Background rates in 2016 are observed to be slightly lower than in 2015, but it is not clear if this is an effect of the optics or a result of vacuum conditioning.

An interesting feature in the \(\beta^{*}\)=40 cm values for beam-1 is that BCID 3052 appears as an outlier with much less background per proton lost than the other bunches in the beam. This is the same bunch that gives suspiciously low \(\mathrm{TCT_{BLM}}/\mathrm{TCP_{BLM-A}}\) ratios in Figure 6(a), while the Background/TCP-loss ratios in Figures 8 and 9 are perfectly in line with the other points. It is difficult to see how these observations could be consistent. Possibly the bunch was giving very unusual impact-parameter distributions at both the TCP and the TCT, which affected the response of the BLMs and the produced background. Since BCID 3052 is a very obvious outlier it would, despite its low count rate, significantly affect the averages in Tables 5 and 6. Therefore it was decided not to include it in the weighted average7.

Footnote 7: In particular inclusion of BCID 3052 would cause the weighted averages of individual bunches to become inconsistent with the ratio of the corresponding sums over these same bunches.

These few bunches showing an inconsistent behaviour, do not challenge the conclusion that when the TCT aperture is decreased, halo-related backgrounds increase by \(\sim\)65% for each unit of \(\sigma\). The most significant observation, however, is that for all normal operational conditions encountered so far at the LHC, the contribution of beam halo to the total BIB in the experiments is at the sub-percent level.

## 6 Correlations between BCM triggers and fake jets

From the recorded event data it is possible to extract the correlation between BCM triggers and fake-jet events. Table 7 lists the number of L1_BCM_AC and L1_BCM_CA triggers and of fake-jet events per BCID during the excitations in the \(\beta^{*}\)=80 cm optics alongside with the number of the cases when a fake-jet event has also fired the BCM background trigger. In order to facilitate a direct comparison with simulations, only fake jets with \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>\)20 GeV and \(|\eta|<1.5\) have been considered. This choice will be explained in Section 7.

Although at \(\beta^{*}\)=80 cm the data are dominated by a single bunch and the count rates are very low, causing the data to have significant statistical uncertainties, some conclusions can be drawn from Table 7:

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{l|c|c|c|c|c|c|c}  & \multicolumn{4}{c|}{Beam-1} & \multicolumn{4}{c}{Beam-2} \\ \hline BCID & 1786 & 2398 & 2551 & Total & 892 & 2498 & 2901 & Total \\ \hline L1\_BCM\_AC & 674 & 38 & 87 & 799 & — & — & — & — \\ L1\_BCM\_CA & — & — & — & — & 929 & 105 & 57 & 1091 \\ Fake jets & 44 & 2 & 3 & 49 & 73 & 12 & 6 & 91 \\ BCM \& Jet & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 3 & 0 & 0 & 3 \\ BCM/Jet & 15.3\(\pm\)2.4 & 19\(\pm\)14 & 29\(\pm\)17 & 15.6\(\pm\)2.4 & 12.7\(\pm\)1.5 & 8.8\(\pm\)2.7 & 9.5\(\pm\)4.1 & 11.6\(\pm\)1.2 \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 7: BCM background trigger counts per BCID and number of fake jets in unpaired bunches at \(\beta^{*}\)=80 cm. The fourth row gives the number of events which have both a BCM trigger and a fake jet. The lowest row gives the ratio between the number of BCM triggers and events with a fake jet. Only fake jets with \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>\)20 GeV and \(|\eta|<1.5\) have been considered.

* There is practically no correlation between the BCM triggers and the fake-jet events. Only three out of a total of 140 fake-jet events also have a BCM trigger, while there are 1890 of the latter, summed over all BCIDs in Table 7.
* There is weak indication that beam-2 halo losses produce relatively more fake-jet events, i.e. a smaller BCM/Jet ratio, than the corresponding losses of beam-1.

The corresponding data for the \(\beta^{*}\)=40 cm are shown in Table 8. At these tighter TCT settings the number of background events is significantly larger. A total of 964 fake-jet events are observed of which 12, i.e. 1.2% have fired also a BCM trigger. While this percentage is perfectly consistent with the \(\beta^{*}\)=80 cm data in Table 7, the indication of smaller BCM/Jet ratio in beam-2 than in beam-1 is not confirmed by the \(\beta^{*}\)=40 cm data. In fact Table 8 indicates the opposite, i.e. a larger BCM/Jet ratio for beam-2 than beam-1. The statistical significance of the \(\beta^{*}\)=80 cm data are not sufficient to determine whether this is just a statistical fluctuation or an indication that the BCM/Jet ratio depends on \(\beta^{*}\).

## 7 Simulations

The background in ATLAS has been estimated by Monte Carlo simulations, for which the input is obtained from beam loss simulations in the LHC [19]. For beam halo losses these simulations proceed in two steps, described in detail in Ref. [2]. In the first step particles scattered on the TCP jaws were transported with the SENTRACK code [8] until they were lost on the TCTs, where their impact points were recorded. The fraction of protons lost on the IR1 TCTs, with respect to the total halo-related loss, is estimated from the SENTRACK simulations and the obtained fractions are given in Table 9 for the two beams and \(\beta^{*}\) settings. These values turn out to be lower, by a factor 3-10, than the data-points in Figure 6(a), which show the ratios of the local loss measurements in IR1 and IR7. Table 9 gives the simulated fraction of losses on the TCTs in IR1 with respect to the total losses on all apertures around the ring. Since, however, about 85%

Table 8: BCM background trigger counts per BCID and number of fake jets in unpaired bunches at \(\beta^{*}\)=40 cm. The third rows give the numbers of events which have both a BCM trigger and a fake jet. The lowest rows give the ratios between the number of BCM triggers and events with a fake jet. Only fake jets with \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>\)20 GeV and \(|\eta|<1.5\) have been considered.

of total halo-related losses take place on the TCPs in IR7, this difference of definitions cannot explain the observed discrepancy. The S3xtrack simulations are done for a perfect machine but it has been shown that including realistic imperfections of the machine elements and their alignment can increase the losses on the TCTs by a factor of 2-3 [12]. Even this, however, falls short of fully explaining the difference between Table 9 and Figure 6(a). The most likely explanation is provided by the response of the BLMs with respect to the number of protons lost on the TCP and TCT, respectively. The possible magnitude of this effect can be understood from Table 3, which illustrates that the response per unit intensity loss can vary by an order of magnitude between different BLMs in IR7.

At the recorded impact points on the TCT, the interactions of the 6.5 TeV protons with the collimator material were simulated with the Fluka code [10]. Subsequently the produced particles were transported with Fluka, using the \(\beta^{*}\)=80 cm optics, to a virtual interface plane 22.6 m upstream of the IP.

For the ATLAS simulations the particles are picked up at the interface plane and transported through the experimental area and the detector using Fluka.

The Fluka framework does not include the detailed hit simulation and digitisation of the Geant4-based ATLAS software [20] and consequently there is no reconstruction of the physics objects in the detectors. Only a simplified BCM trigger emulation and fake-jet reconstruction have been implemented in the Fluka simulation. For the BCM detector each charged particle with energy above 100 keV entering the sensitive detector volume is assumed to give a hit. A sensitivity study with respect to this cutoff was done and showed that the hit rate is reduced by only a few percent even for a 1 MeV cutoff8. The timing information, with respect to the passage of the bunch centre at the IP, is rigorously propagated in the entire simulation chain, so it is possible to reconstruct the BCM trigger signature by requiring a hit in one of the upstream modules within the _early_ window (\(-6.25\pm 2.73\) ns) and a hit in any of the downstream modules in the _in-time_ window (\(6.25\pm 2.73\) ns). For this trigger emulation the time spread due to the LHC bunch length of 7.5 cm and a 600 ps instrumental time resolution of the BCM have been taken into account.

Fake-jet production rates are estimated by recording local energy depositions in the calorimeters on an event-by-event basis. After simulation of each event the energy depositions are analysed to determine whether there was a local cluster of depositions with an energy sum large enough to exceed the 12 GeV transverse energy threshold of the jet trigger. For the jet reconstruction the calorimeter was divided into sub-regions: Barrel Liquid Argon (B-LAr), Barrel Tile (B-Tile) and Downstream Endcap (Down-EC) as described in Table 10 together with the (r, \(\phi\), z)-binning applied to each sub-region. Energy depositions in each event are recorded per bin and the values in 3\(\times\)3\(\times\)3 = 27 bins, centred around the maximum deposition, are used to reconstruct the energy-weighted position of the cluster and its energy9. Each deposition is used only once, starting with the highest deposition in any bin.

Footnote 9: If the highest bin is next to the calorimeter (and binning) boundary in \(r\) or \(z\), the sum is only over the existing neighbouring bins.

The standard ATLAS jet reconstruction includes a jet energy scale calibration, which takes into account the hadronic fraction in jets and the reduced calorimeter response to it. These jet calibrations are tuned for average jets emerging from the IP, while the fake jets from BIB are mostly due to muon bremsstrahlung or \(e^{+}e^{-}\) pair production. This means that instead of pointing to the IP, they are elongated along \(z\) and almost entirely of electromagnetic nature. Therefore the standard jet calibration is not applicable and jet transverse momenta are compared at the electromagnetic scale.

Files of particles reaching the interface plane at z=22.6 m were produced with two different transport cutoffs. A file with a 20 MeV cutoff is presumed to include all particles which are relevant for the BCM trigger rate simulation and for the fake-jet studies. Simulations with such a low cutoff, however, are very time-consuming which limited the number of primary protons to less than five million per beam. Fake jets, especially in the barrel calorimeters, are almost exclusively produced by radiative energy losses of high energy muons traversing the calorimeters. Muons with high enough energy to create fake jets with sizable \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) are relatively rare and the number of them in the 20 MeV file was insufficient to obtain enough fake jets for a detailed study. Therefore files with a 20 GeV cutoff were produced, based on about 287 million protons lost on the TCT per beam.

In the ATLAS simulation, a transport threshold of 100 keV was used for both types of files. Since a sizable amount of material is present between the interface plane and the BCM or calorimeters, it is practically excluded that any particles with energy less than 20 MeV at the interface plane could directly reach the detectors used in this study10.

Footnote 10: In particular, the TAS absorber, a 1.8 m long copper block at z=19 m, surrounded by thick iron shielding, seals the tunnel entry. The only direct passage is in the centre of the TAS where a hole of 34 mm diameter is left for the beam.

While the entire 20 MeV file could easily be treated in the ATLAS simulation, this turned out to be very CPU-intensive for the entire 20 GeV file. Therefore only 25 % (68.1 million events) of the latter were simulated to serve as consistency check and a further selection was made by considering from the 20 GeV file only events which had muons. The obtained file will be referred to as "20 GeV\(\mu\)". For beam-1 it includes 6.9 million events which correspond to the full statistics of 287 million protons lost on the TCT.

The mutual consistency of these files is validated in Table 1111 for the different observables by comparing the rates per proton lost from beam-1. The fifth column shows the ratios of observed triggers per simulated proton lost on the TCT. Within statistics, all three files give the same rate for the fake jets. In order to remove a possible contribution12 from fake jets due to hadronic showers hitting the endcaps, the comparison of fake-jet data with simulations is limited to the range \(|\eta|<1.5\). The BCM trigger rate per proton obtained using the 20 GeV file is found to be about 8% lower than using the 20 MeV file, which is presumed to reproduce the full trigger rate. The 20 GeV\(\mu\) file misses most of the BCM trigger events and is unusable for any BCM-related studies.

Footnote 12: Although the count rates in the last column of Table 11 give no indication of purely hadronic fake jets in the endcaps, this does not exclude their possible presence in data.

The BCM/Jet ratio can be evaluated from the counts given in the fourth column of Table 11. For the 20 MeV file a ratio of 13.5\(\pm\)1.2 is obtained and for the 20 GeV file, after correcting the BCM counts up by 8%, the ratio is 13.9\(\pm\)0.3. Both values are in excellent agreement with Tables 7 and 8.

The values given in the sub-calorimeter columns for the BCM triggers, i.e. in the lower right part of the table, show how often a BCM trigger is accompanied by a fake jet in the given calorimeter region. There are just eight counts for the 20 GeV file which, given the total of 2088 fake-jet events, indicates a correlation of only 0.4%, i.e. even less than seen in Tables 7 and 8 for the data. While this could very well be a fluctuation due to the small count rate, it might also be a real effect: an inspection of the 2088 events reveals that only 11 of them do not have a muon traversing the radial range of the calorimeters. Seven of the eight events with both a BCM trigger and a fake jet are among these 11 non-muonic events, which suggests that \(\sim\)3/4 of events give a BCM trigger if the fake jet is due to hadronic showers but less than a per mil if the fake jet is due to a muon. Since such non-muonic events are likely to be more abundant in close-by beam-gas scattering, even the relatively low level of beam-gas can cause the correlation in the data to be larger than in the halo-only simulations.

Table 12 compares the simulated event rates, per proton lost, with data. The second step of the LHC simulations, i.e. showering on the TCT and transport to the interface plane, has only been performed for the \(\beta^{*}\)=80 cm optics, while the \(\beta^{*}\)=40 cm data has many more events and thus better statistics. The only difference between \(\beta^{*}\)=40 cm and \(\beta^{*}\)=80 cm, affecting the region between the TCT and the IP, is a minor

The counts per sub-calorimeter refer to the leading jet. Sub-leading jets, of which there are very few, are ignored. The sub-calorimeter entries for the BCM indicate the number of events that have a fake jet in that calorimeter region and a BCM trigger. The two endcap cylinders described in Table 10 are treated as one region. In the 20 GeV\(\mu\) file only the 6.9 million events which contained muons where included, but since only muons are relevant for fake jet production, these correspond to the full statistics of 287 million events.

change in the currents of the inner triplet magnets. Since the debris from the proton loss on the TCT has a wide momentum spread, the small change in the quadrupole field strengths should have a negligible impact on the background in ATLAS. This justifies a comparison of the available \(\beta^{*}\)=80 cm simulations with \(\beta^{*}\)=40 cm data, as provided in the lower half of Table 12. It is seen that the data/MC ratios are very similar to those obtained at \(\beta^{*}\)=80 cm, except for the BCM triggers of beam-1, where the simulations give a higher rate than seen in the \(\beta^{*}\)=40 cm data. This one case put aside, BCM and fake-jet rates give consistent data/MC ratios for a given beam. While the simulations agree perfectly with the data for beam-1, a significant difference is seen for beam-2. It should be recalled that from IR7, where 85% of the initial losses take place, beam-1 travels only one quadrant of the ring before reaching ATLAS, while beam-2 has to pass three quadrants with aperture restrictions in IR6, IR5 and IR3. It is therefore not surprising to see a larger deviation in beam-2. Actually the perfect agreement of beam-1 must be largely fortuitous and even the beam-2 results must be considered a rather good agreement. In particular, the loss fractions given in Table 9 are based on the Skitrack simulations assuming an ideal LHC ring and, as explained before, have an uncertainty by a factor of 2-3, most likely in the direction of underestimating the rates on the TCTs. Even the data/MC discrepancy by a factor of \(\sim\)2.5, seen in Table 12 for beam-2, is within this uncertainty.

The \(\beta^{*}\)=80 cm data contain too few fake-jet events to compare any differential distribution with the simulations. But since Table 12 suggests that going from \(\beta^{*}\)=80 cm to \(\beta^{*}\)=40 cm does not introduce major differences into the transport from the TCT to ATLAS, the simulated distributions are compared with the \(\beta^{*}\)=40 cm data. Figure 11(a) shows the transverse momentum distribution of fake jets obtained from the simulation and seen in data for beam-1. Within the statistical uncertainties the agreement is perfect for \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>\)20 GeV. Below 20 GeV the simulated \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) distribution continues on the rising slope, while the data dips down. This is due to the L1_J12 trigger which reaches full efficiency only above 20 GeV. Since this trigger turn-on affects the low-\(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) data, but is not included in the simulations, the comparisons of data with MC are restricted to jets with \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>\)20 GeV. The azimuthal distributions of fake jets obtained in the simulation and seen in beam-1 data are compared in Figure 11(b): the shape is well reproduced.

It is evident from Table 12 that in corresponding plots for beam-2, the data and simulations would differ by a factor of about 2.5. The plots are not presented here, but aside of this difference in absolute scale the shapes agree equally well as for beam-1.

## 8 Background from elastic beam-gas scattering

The results presented in this note show that in normal physics operation tertiary halo losses on the TCT give only a negligible contribution to beam backgrounds in ATLAS. Another process that leads to protons being lost on the TCT is elastic beam-gas scattering all around the LHC ring.

Simulations [1, 2] indicate that most of the protons scattered elastically in the LHC arcs end up on the IR7 collimators. However, if these protons pass other aperture restrictions, like a TCT, before reaching IR7, they might be intercepted already there.

Simulations reported in [2] indicate that most of the elastic protons being lost on IR1 TCTs originate from two LHC octants for beam-1 but from six LHC octants for beam-2, which corresponds to the respective distances from IR7 to IR1 along the beam trajectory. Although the contribution of a given octant depends on the distance and other aperture restrictions on the way, the simulations indicate that the elastic contribution to ATLAS backgrounds should be about two times larger for beam-2 than for beam-1.

During normal physics operation in LHC Run-1 the backgrounds from beam-1 have been systematically higher than those from beam-2, by typically \(\sim\)30% [3, 4]. A similar beam-1 excess has been observed

Figure 11: Comparison of \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) and azimuthal distributions of fake jets from simulations and data for beam-1 losses at \(\beta^{*}\)=40 cm and a TCT aperture of 8.8 \(\sigma\). The TCT loss fraction of 3.6\(\times 10^{-4}\), as given in Table 9, has been used to normalise the simulation results. The azimuthal angle (\(\phi\)) is measured with respect to the x-axis, which in the ATLAS coordinate system points towards the centre of the LHC ring.

also throughout Run-2. Since this is opposite to what is expected from the elastic beam-gas contribution, it is a hint that elastic beam-gas is not a dominant contribution to the background.

Unfortunately this background component is difficult to assess experimentally, since it requires high beam intensity in order to have a representative dynamic pressure in the LHC arcs. In those conditions it is masked by the, presumably dominant, contribution from local inelastic beam-gas scattering. With a full intensity beam in the LHC, machine protection rules are very strict and do not leave much room for any collimation studies. In particular, the hierarchy of primary, secondary and tertiary collimators has to be preserved at all times.

Towards the end of the 2016 proton run, in LHC fill 5423, a preliminary test to evaluate the importance of the elastic beam-gas component was performed [21]. In this fill full intensity beams with 2200 bunches were used. It is shown in Section 5 that in these conditions the tertiary halo losses contribute at most a negligible 1% to the total beam background in ATLAS. At full beam intensity the TCT could be closed only from its nominal setting of \(9.0\,\sigma\) down to the interlock limit of \(8.4\,\sigma\). Furthermore, since such a tight setting was not qualified for unsynchronised beam aborts which deflect protons horizontally, only the aperture of the vertical TCTs was reduced. The dependence of background on TCT aperture, found from the fits in Section 5, suggests that a TCT aperture reduction by \(0.6\,\sigma\) would lead to a halo-related background increase of 30-40 %. But this is for reducing the aperture of both TCTs and obtained for tertiary halo which might have a distribution different from that of elastically scattered protons. Assuming, however, that the elastically scattered protons have the same betatron amplitude distribution as the tertiary halo and that reducing only the vertical TCT gives half the effect, then the test should lead to a \(\sim\)15% (\(\sim\)5%) background increase if 100% (30%) of the total were due to elastic beam-gas13. Since these assumptions are rather vague this test can at best provide support to the assumption (reached from the predicted vs. observed beam-1/beam-2 asymmetry) that the role of elastic beam-gas is negligible. It will not be possible to quantify the elastic component from such a test.

Footnote 13: Since it has been shown that the tertiary halo component contributes less than a percent to the total, it will not play any role in this test.

The observed BCM and fake-jet14 backgrounds are shown in Figure 12(a). The shaded area indicates the period when the vertical TCT was at the reduced aperture setting. No increase can be observed by eye in the BCM background and the fake-jet rates have so much scatter that only a very substantial increase would be visible.

Footnote 14: Jet trigger rate with 12 GeV threshold in unpaired bunches

But since even a 15% excess would be hard to see in Figure 12(a), a more quantitative analysis was done. For this the BCM background data on either side of the aperture-reduction period were fitted with a second order polynomial and the average ratio between the data and this fit was evaluated for the period of reduced aperture. As a consistency check the ratio was also evaluated for control periods just before and just after the test, using time spans of equal length as the period with reduced TCT aperture. The results are listed in Table 13 where it can be seen that, for the control periods, values consistent with unity are obtained. For beam-1 the rate during the reduced aperture is found to be slightly reduced. If this is just a statistical fluctuation or some real effect of the TCT reducing slightly the background, cannot be determined.

In order to verify what amount of increase would be detectable by this method, the rates during the period of reduced aperture were increased by 5% and 15%, by just scaling up the data. The visual effect on the curves can be appreciated from Figure 12(b) and the average ratios with respect to the fit are given in Table. 13. While a 5% increase is barely visible in the plot, it is clearly seen in Table 13. A 15%increase becomes visible also in the plot. From these results and checks a background increase of more than 1-2% due to the closing of the vertical TCT can be excluded. Provided the assumptions made before are justified, this implies that elastic beam-gas contributes less than \(\sim\)10% to the total background. While a more extensive test by reducing also the horizontal aperture has to wait for a full machine protection

qualification of such a setup, the results obtained in this first test already exclude that elastic beam-gas could give a significant contribution to the total beam background in ATLAS.

## 9 Conclusions

In 2015 ATLAS recorded background data during LHC loss-map measurements at two different \(\beta^{*}\) settings. The primary aim was to determine the dependence of the observed backgrounds on the aperture of the tertiary collimators (TCT) at \(\beta^{*}\)=40 cm.

Since the loss map measurements are done with very low beam intensity, the residual pressure in the LHC ring is much lower than in normal conditions. At the same time the excited halo losses temporarily reach very high values. In these conditions the observed backgrounds are almost entirely due to halo losses, providing very clean conditions to study this component.

Backgrounds were monitored with the ATLAS Beam Conditions Monitor (BCM) and through the rate of fake jets in the calorimeters. Both methods gave consistent results and indicate that the background as a function of TCT aperture in nominal \(\sigma\) can be fitted by an exponential with a slope around -0.5.

Since the bunch intensity reduction during the excitations is dominated by the halo losses the data allow determining the dependence of ATLAS backgrounds on the beam losses at the beam-cleaning collimators. At \(\beta^{*}\)=80 cm the BCM background is measured to be \((0.5-1)\times\)10\({}^{-8}\) counts per proton lost. The corresponding background level \(\beta^{*}\)=40 cm and the TCT at 8.8 \(\sigma\) is \((0.6-1)\times\)10\({}^{-7}\) per proton lost. In normal operation the loss rate per bunch is around 10\({}^{5}\) Hz, which implies that the halo-related BCM background is about 0.001 Hz and 0.01 Hz at \(\beta^{*}\)=80 cm and \(\beta^{*}\)=40 cm, respectively. During 2015 and 2016 LHC operation the normal level of BCM background was between 1-3 Hz/bunch, which means that the beam halo losses contribute less than one percent to the total background. The relative halo contribution to the fake-jet background is at a similar level.

The data were also used to study the correlation between halo-related background events seen by the BCM and producing fake jets. It is found that only \(\sim\)1 % of events with a fake jet in \(|\eta|<1.5\) and with \(p_{\rm T}\) >20 GeV have also fired the BCM background trigger.

The data were also compared with Monte Carlo simulations of the halo-related background. The MC is carried out in three steps: the SXTRACK simulation code provides the loss pattern around the ring and Fluka is used for the simulation of proton interactions in the TCT and the transport of secondaries in the LHC geometry and, subsequently, in ATLAS. The absolute scale of the simulation result is obtained through a normalisation by the measured total number of protons lost from the beam. The fraction of protons that are lost on the TCT is obtained from the loss-pattern given by SXTRACK. The Fluka simulations of proton interactions and shower transport have so far been performed only for the \(\beta^{*}\)=80 cm optics, but results seem to agree also with the \(\beta^{*}\)=40 cm data, where better statistics are available. For beam-1 an excellent agreement between the measured and simulated background rates per proton lost is obtained. For beam-2 the simulations fall a factor 2.5 below the data, but this is still within the estimated uncertainty of the SXTRACK simulations, especially since beam-2 corresponds to a longer trajectory from IR7 to IR1, with several aperture restrictions.

The simulated spectrum of energy deposition in calorimeters agrees perfectly with the spectra of apparent transverse energy of the observed fake jets. Also the azimuthal distribution of the fake jets, with the characteristic peaks in the horizontal plane, is well reproduced by the simulations.

The loss-map tests assess only the halo-related backgrounds, but not those from beam-gas. At the end of 2016 LHC operation a first attempt was made to set limits to the contribution from elastic beam-gas around the accelerator ring. For this test the TCT aperture was slightly reduced during a normal physics fill. Since inelastic beam-gas scattering is presumed to be insensitive to the TCT aperture, this test should probe the background rate due to far-away elastic beam-gas events, provided it is above the \(\sim\) 1% contribution from halo-losses. With a TCT aperture reduction of 0.6 \(\sigma\), the maximum allowed with full beam intensity, no background increase was seen in the BCM. Comparison with the loss-map test results allows setting a upper limit of \(\sim\)10 % for the possible contribution from elastic beam-gas scattering to the total BCM background.
