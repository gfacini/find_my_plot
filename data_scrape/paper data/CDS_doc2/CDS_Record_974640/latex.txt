###### Abstract

This note describes a study performed on \(\mathrm{t\overline{t}}\) events decaying in the lepton+jets channel and it is aimed to determine the discovery potential of a narrow \(\mathrm{t\overline{t}}\) resonance with ATLAS detector. The results given here have been obtained with Pythia 5.7 and Atlfast. A comparison with results obtained using the Rome AOD fully reconstructed \(\mathrm{t\overline{t}}\) events is also given.

## 1 Introduction

Since its mass is much larger than the other quarks, the Top quark plays a special role in the electroweak symmetry breaking (EWSB). Any new physics in connection with EWSB would be preferentially coupled to the Top, leading to deviations from the Standard Model (SM) in the \(\mathrm{t\overline{t}}\) production rate and to modified Top quark kinematics distributions. For example, new resonances or gauge bosons strongly coupled to the Top are expected in a large variety of models, in particular in strong EWSB [1],[2],[3]. These new particles could be revealed in the \(\mathrm{t\overline{t}}\) invariant mass distribution. A preliminary evaluation of the sensitivity to a 'generic' narrow resonance decaying into \(\mathrm{t\overline{t}}\) has been reported in [3]. The exercise is repeated here, using as starting point the analysis developed to measure to a high precision the Top mass in the semi-leptonic decay channel [4].

## 2 Event generation

### \(\mathrm{t\overline{t}}\) resonance generation

The goal of this study is to determine the 5 \(\sigma\) discovery potential of narrow \(\mathrm{t\overline{t}}\) resonances with masses between 400 \(\mathrm{GeV/c^{2}}\) (value close to production threshold) and 5000 \(\mathrm{GeV/c^{2}}\) (mass limit for \(\mathrm{t\overline{t}}\) resonances production at LHC). The selection and the reconstruction of \(\mathrm{t\overline{t}}\) resonances will be optimized in order to have a good resonance reconstruction purity without neglecting the reconstruction efficiency. To choose the more relevant selection criteria, 50000 \(\mathrm{t\overline{t}}\) resonances for each mass are generated in order to have enough statistic to determine the reconstruction efficiency after applying the selection criteria.

The choice has been done to generate Technicolor \(\mathrm{t\overline{t}}\) resonances which are spin-0 \(\eta_{techni}\) mesons, electroweak singlet and QCD colour octet [9] :

\[\mathrm{gg}\rightarrow\eta_{techni}\]

Nine batches of 50000 \(\eta_{techni}\) events have been produced with Pythia 5.7, with a mass from 400 \(\mathrm{GeV/c^{2}}\) to 1200 \(\mathrm{GeV/c^{2}}\) by step of 100 \(\mathrm{GeV/c^{2}}\). This step is small enough to cover the whole \(\mathrm{t\overline{t}}\) mass range of the SM \(\mathrm{t\overline{t}}\) production. Eight other batches of 50000 \(\eta_{techni}\) events are produced with mass from 1500 \(\mathrm{GeV/c^{2}}\) to 5000 \(\mathrm{GeV/c^{2}}\) by step of 500 \(\mathrm{GeV/c^{2}}\) to study the effect of the selection criteria at higher masses.

In the model implemented in Pythia 5.7, the Technicolor \(\eta_{techni}\) decays in the following three channels :

* \(\eta_{techni}\to t\overline{t}\)
* \(\eta_{techni}\to b\overline{b}\)
* \(\eta_{techni}\to gg\)

The branching ratio for this three channels changes with the \(\eta_{techni}\) generated mass (Fig. 1). When \(\eta_{techni}\) mass increases from 400 to 5000 \(\mathrm{GeV/c^{2}}\), the \(\eta_{techni}\to t\overline{t}\) branching ratio decreases. It becomes lower than \(\eta_{techni}\to gg\) for a \(\eta_{techni}\) mass above 4000 \(\mathrm{GeV/c^{2}}\). So, the \(\mathrm{t\overline{t}}\) resonance production rate decreases when\(\eta_{techni}\) mass increases. The \(\eta_{techni}\to b\overline{b}\) branching ratio remains small compared to the other ones. The Pythia 5.7 parameters have been chosen as following :

* The W boson mass : 80.25 GeV/c\({}^{2}\)
* The Top quark mass : 175 GeV/c\({}^{2}\)
* Initial and final state radiations and multiple interactions are taken into account
* b quark fragmentation is described by Peterson function [8] with \(\epsilon_{\rm b}=-0.006\)
* The structure function of protons is described by CTEQ2L [9], which is reported in Figure 3 for Q\({}^{2}\) = 1000\({}^{2}\) GeV\({}^{2}\)

Figure 2 gives the total width of the \(\eta_{techni}\) resonance as a function of the \(\eta_{techni}\) mass. This linear behaviour is only due to the model implemented in Pythia 5.7 to produce Technicolor particles.

Figure 4 shows the \(\eta_{techni}\to t\bar{t}\) mass spectrum at generation level for some generated masses. It can be seen that the \(\rm t\bar{t}\) yield decreases when the resonance mass increases. Above 2000 GeV/c\({}^{2}\), a tail in the mass spectra appears, increasing as a function of the \(\eta_{techni}\) mass. As the LHC is an hadron collider, the \(\eta_{techni}\) production cross section is the convolution of the gluon partonic distribution in proton (which has a \(1/x\) behaviour for small \(x\) (see Fig. 3)) with the excitation probability of a resonance (which is a Breit-Wigner). The observed

The given entries number corresponds to resonances decaying into \(t\bar{t}\)._

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:4]

tails are an effect of this convolution. For a lower LHC center of mass energy, the tail would appear at a lower resonance mass as can be seen in Figure 5. On the other hand, the tail would appear at higher resonance mass for LHC operating at \(\sqrt{s}=28~{}TeV\) (Figure 6).

### SM Top quark generation: production and decays

Top quarks are produced through two different mechanisms in the SM. The first one is the electroweak production of single Top quark with an expected total cross section at the LHC of the order of 300 pb. The second mechanism, more interesting for this study, is the production of \(\mathrm{t\overline{t}}\) pairs (Figure 7). At the LHC, the total production cross section of such \(\mathrm{t\overline{t}}\) pairs is estimated at 833 pb at NLO level [3]. 90 % of this production comes from gluon-gluon fusion [5].

The integrated luminosity after one year at low luminosity at the LHC is expected to be 10 fb\({}^{-1}\) : about 8 millions of \(\mathrm{t\overline{t}}\) pairs will be produced in one year with such a luminosity.

In the SM framework, the Top quark decays mainly into \(t\to W+b\). The decay modes of the Top quark are linked to the decay modes of the W boson which decays into two quarks in 68 % of the cases, and into leptonic modes \(\mathrm{e^{-}+\nu_{e}}\), \(\mu^{-}+\nu_{\mu}\) and \(\tau^{-}+\nu_{\tau}\) roughly at 10.7 % [6].

The signature of the Top-pair final states is given by the decay channels of the W boson :

* All hadronic decay mode
* All leptonic decay mode
* Semi-leptonic decay mode

In the all hadronic decay channel, the \(\mathrm{t\overline{t}}\) decay produces two b quarks and two W bosons which decay into light quarks. This decay channel produces six quarks in the final state if initial and final state radiations are not considered. Even if the branching ratio for this channel is high (46 %), it will be very difficult to extract the signal due to a huge QCD background.

In the all leptonic channel, each W boson decays into a lepton and a neutrino :

\[\begin{array}{l}W\to e+\nu_{e}\\ W\to\mu+\nu_{\mu}\\ W\to\tau+\nu_{\tau}\end{array} \tag{1}\]

The total branching ratio for all leptonic channels is roughly 10 %. This channel leads to a final state with two neutrinos which do not allow the complete Top quarks reconstruction.

The semi-leptonic decay mode is the best compromise between the two previous decay modes. One of the W boson decays into two light quarks whereas the other one decays into a lepton and a neutrino. This channel allows to reconstruct more easily the Top quark decaying into hadrons. For the semi-leptonic channel, the branching ratio is roughly 44 %.

The main background to a \(\mathrm{t\overline{t}}\) resonance signal is coming from the non-resonant decays of the SM \(\mathrm{t\overline{t}}\) pairs. The event generation is done with Pythia 5.7 Monte Carlo simulation code [9] which produces

\(pp\to gg\to t\overline{t}\) with \(\sqrt{s}=14\) TeV in the center of mass.

Only the \(\mathrm{t\overline{t}}\) semi-leptonic mode is considered in this study:

\[pp\to X\to t\overline{t}\to WbW\overline{b}\to b\mu_{b}bjj\]

More specifically, the W bosons decaying into \(\tau+\nu_{\tau}\) will not be considered here because too challenging. Only the W decaying into \(\mu+\nu_{\mu}\) and \(e+\nu_{e}\) will be reconstructed. The semi-leptonic \(\mathrm{t\overline{t}}\) branching ratio for each of this two channels is of the order of 14 %.

Because the muons are easier to handle with Atlfast, only \(W\to\mu+\nu_{\mu}\) will be considered in the following. However, the \(W\to\mu+\nu_{\mu}\) and \(W\to e+\nu_{e}\) channels will be used to determine the 5 \(\sigma\) discovery potential of a narrow \(\mathrm{t\overline{t}}\) resonance, assuming that the reconstruction efficiency is the same for both channels.

Figure 7: _Production diagrams of \(\mathrm{t\overline{t}}\) pairs in the SM._

\(4.6fb^{-1}\) SM t\(\overline{\rm t}\) pairs have been generated to evaluate the size of the background. The final state contains at least four jets, two of them being b-jets, and a muon :

\[pp\to X\to t\overline{t}\to WbW\overline{b}\to b\mu\nu_{p}bjj\]

To be complete, events which have the same topology as the t\(\overline{\rm t}\) events have been produced (see Tab 1). Previous analysis [4] showed that the minimal selection criteria applied in this study allow to keep the physical background events out of the selected events.

### Detector simulation

For each generated event, the detector response is simulated by Atlasr[10] which allows to reconstruct the 4-momentum of particles interacting in the detector, with the expected detector resolution. The jet reconstruction is achieved using a fixed cone algorithm (\(\Delta R=0.4\) in this analysis) with a minimal transverse momentum threshold of 15 GeV/c.

To take into account the b and c quarks and \(\tau\) tag efficiency, the Atlasr-b code is used with a b-tag efficiency fixed at 60 %.

In addition, the Atlasr-b code allows to calibrate jets to the parton energies.

## 3 \(\rm t\overline{\rm t}\) invariant mass reconstruction

### Event selection

The initial and final state radiations increase the number of jets in an event. To keep the efficiency high, the number of non-b tagged jets is allowed to be greater than 2 at preselection level. This implies then to make a choice of the two jets belonging to the hadronic Top quark decay. In addition, the final state radiation effect leads to an underestimation of the reconstructed jet energy for jets coming from the W decay.

In order to reduce the physical background discussed previously, the events have to pass the following selection criteria to be selected :

* Missing transverse momentum above 40 GeV/c\({}^{2}\)
* At least an isolated muon with a transverse momentum greater than 20 GeV/c
* At least four jets with transverse momentum above 40 GeV/c, two of them being b-tagged jets
* The muon and jets pseudo-rapidity must satisfy \(|\eta|<2.5\)

The two first cuts allow to reject efficiently the \(b\overline{b}\) background [4]. The W+jets and \(\tau\)+jets background are rejected by requiring four jets with transverse momentum greater than 40 GeV/c. The presence of two b-tagged jets among the four jets reduces the remaining background to a negligible level.

Figure 8 gives the event selection efficiency versus the t\(\overline{\rm t}\) resonance batch mass. The efficiency is maximum for a t\(\overline{\rm t}\) resonance mass around 1500 GeV/c\({}^{2}\). Below 500 GeV/c\({}^{2}\), the efficiency is reduced due to the selection cuts. But relaxing these cuts would increase significantly the background. The loss of efficiency at higher masses is due to an other phenomenon. As can be seen in Figure 9, the higher is the t\(\overline{\rm t}\) resonance mass, the closer are the b and light jets causing the two initial partons to be merged into a single reconstructed jet by the cone reconstruction algorithm. The same behaviour can be observed with the muons and b-jets. For muons, a relaxed isolation criterion has been investigated. It increases the efficiency at high resonance masses

by a factor 2. Nevertheless, the isolation criterion applied on muons is one of the most efficient to reject the background, especially b\(\bar{\rm b}\) events. In addition, when the cut is relaxed, the number of selected muons in the event increases and a choice of the right muon candidate has to be made. For these reasons, the standard isolation criterion for the muon has been kept as the baseline in the following.

To solve the jets overlapping problem, an analysis like the one developed for the Top quark mass measurement where the transverse momentum of the Top is above 250 GeV/c [11][4] could be considered. In [11], the t and \(\bar{\rm t}\) are emitted back-to-back and the invariant mass is determined using large calorimetric clusters rather than reconstructing the individual jets. This method has not been investigated in the following. An other possibility would be to reconstruct jets using a \(\Delta\)R cone lower than 0.4.

### Hadronic Top quark reconstruction

The hadronic Top quark reconstruction is done in two stages. First two light jets are associated to form the W boson. Then, the reconstructed W is associated to a b-jet to reconstruct the hadronic Top quark.

Because of ISR and FSR, more than two light jets are present in an event. If all combinations of two light jets are made, only one among several pairs will correspond to a W boson. The reconstruction purity is increased by keeping only one combination, the one with an invariant mass the closest to the W mass peak. In Figure 10 the invariant mass spectrum of hadronic W boson for \(\rm t\bar{t}\) resonances and SM \(\rm t\bar{t}\) pairs are given. The huge combinatorial background (dark area) obtained for 2000 GeV/c\({}^{2}\)\(\rm t\bar{t}\) resonances is due to the jet overlapping effect.

To improve the signal purity, a new cut is applied. Only events with a light jet combination mass verifying the following are conserved :

\[|\rm m_{jj}-M_{W}^{PDG}|\leq 20~{}GeV/c^{2} \tag{2}\]

To reconstruct the hadronic Top quark, a b-tagged jet is associated to reconstructed W boson. Several choices are possible to select the right jet for the association [7][4]. Here, the retained solution is to associate the reconstructed W with the b-jet giving the greatest Top transverse momentum. Figure 11 shows the Top quark mass peak after selection for some generated \(\eta_{techni}\) masses. To improve the reconstruction purity, only events verifying equation 3 are selected :

\[|\mathrm{m}_{\mathrm{b}li}-\mathrm{M}^{\mathrm{p}eak}_{\mathrm{t}op}|\leq 40 \mathrm{~{}GeV/c^{2}} \tag{3}\]

\(\mathrm{M}^{\mathrm{p}eak}_{\mathrm{t}op}\) is the average value of the hadronic Top quark mass obtained fitting the SM hadronic Top quark spectrum (Figure 11-up ) with a gaussian.

### Leptonic Top quark reconstruction

The same procedure is used : the leptonic W reconstruction first and then the leptonic Top quark reconstruction built from the association of the leptonic W and the remaining b-jet. It is more difficult to reconstruct the leptonic Top quark because the presence of a neutrino does not allow a total reconstruction. However, the neutrino being a W decay product, and because the W mass is well known, it is possible to reconstruct the neutrino +momentum with a quadratic ambiguity.

First of all, if several isolated muons are present, the one which has the highest momentum is selected. For the neutrino, a simple hypothesis is made attributing the whole missing transverse energy to the neutrino transverse momentum :

\[\mathrm{P}^{\nu}_{\mathrm{T}}=\mathrm{E}^{\mathrm{M}ISS}_{\mathrm{T}} \tag{4}\]

However, as other effects contribute also to the missing transverse energy, this hypothesis leads to overestimate the neutrino transverse energy to 2-3 % [7]. To reconstruct the neutrino longitudinal momentum, the mass of the muon+neutrino system has to be exactly equal to the PDG W mass. This leads to solve the equation :

\[\alpha\mathrm{P}^{\nu}_{\mathrm{T}}{}^{2}+\beta\mathrm{P}^{\nu}_{\mathrm{T}}+ \gamma=0\]

with

\[\alpha=(\mathrm{E}^{\mu 2}-\mathrm{P}^{\mu 2}_{\mathrm{T}})\]

\[\beta=\mathrm{P}^{1}_{\mathrm{T}}(\mathrm{M}^{2}_{\mu}-\mathrm{M}^{2}_{W}-2( \mathrm{P}^{\mu}_{\mathrm{T}}\mathrm{P}^{\nu}_{\mathrm{T}}+\mathrm{P}^{\mu}_{ \mathrm{Y}}\mathrm{P}^{\nu}_{\mathrm{Y}}))\]

\[\gamma=\mathrm{E}^{\mu 2}\mathrm{P}^{\nu 2}_{\mathrm{T}}{}^{2}-(\mathrm{M}^{2}_{W}- \mathrm{M}^{2}_{\mu}+\mathrm{P}^{\mu}_{\mathrm{X}}\mathrm{P}^{\nu}_{\mathrm{ X}}+\mathrm{P}^{\mu}_{\mathrm{Y}}\mathrm{P}^{\nu}_{\mathrm{Y}})^{2} \tag{5}\]

In 14 % to 24 % of the cases according to the generated resonance mass, the equation does not have a real solution because the neutrino transverse momentum is overestimated. In these cases, the neutrino transverse energy is decreased by step of 0.1 GeV/c until a real solution is found.

Equation 4 leads to two \(\mathrm{P}^{\nu}_{\mathrm{T}}\) solutions. In the leptonic Top quark reconstruction, the selected \(\mathrm{P}^{\nu}_{\mathrm{T}}\) solution is the one which gives the nearest leptonic Top quark mass to \(\mathrm{M}^{\mathrm{p}eak}_{\mathrm{t}op}\). The combinatorial background is lower than observed in the hadronic Top reconstruction.

As in the hadronic Top case, the tail above the leptonic Top quark mass peak is essentially due to combinatorial background. Therefore to improve the reconstruction purity, events have to satisfy equation 6 to be selected :

\[|\mathrm{m}_{\mathrm{b}\mu\nu}-\mathrm{M}^{\mathrm{p}eak}_{\mathrm{t}op}| \leq 40\mathrm{~{}GeV/c^{2}} \tag{6}\]

### \(\mathrm{t}\overline{\mathrm{t}}\) reconstruction

Only events verifying equations 3 and 6 are retained to reconstruct the \(\mathrm{t}\overline{\mathrm{t}}\) invariant mass. Figure 12 gives the \(\mathrm{t}\overline{\mathrm{t}}\) mass spectrum obtained with resonances and SM \(\mathrm{t}\overline{\mathrm{t}}\) pairs. The 2000 GeV/c\({}^{2}\)\(\eta_{techni}\) mass spectrum is not centered on the generated mass because of the effect discussed previously (see SS2.1). The background contribution (dark area) contains events where at least one assignment in the reconstruction of the hadronic or leptonic Top is wrong. In a fraction of these events, the selected jets and leptons are the ones associated to the resonance decay but not appropriately attributed to the right Top decay. Nevertheless, the reconstructed invariant mass is still the right one for these events. The bin content of SM \(\mathrm{t}\overline{\mathrm{t}}\) invariant mass spectrum is reported in the Table 2. The SM \(\mathrm{t}\overline{\mathrm{t}}\) spectrum has a higher combinatorial background (as define above) than the resonance spectrum (Figure 12), however this is not a problem since this spectrum is studied only to determine the non-resonant \(\mathrm{t}\overline{\mathrm{t}}\) background.

Table 3 shows the reconstruction purity and efficiency obtained for 800 GeV/c\({}^{2}\) and 2000 GeV/c\({}^{2}\) resonance mass : the reconstruction purity is relatively good, of the order of 70 %. Figure 13 presents the \(\eta_{techni}\) resonance

reconstruction purity with respect to the generated mass : tt resonances with mass between 600 and 5000 GeV/c\({}^{2}\) would be reconstructed with a purity above 60 %. The reconstruction efficiency of tt resonances is given in Figure 14. The loss of efficiency above 1000 GeV/c\({}^{2}\) is the consequence of the efficiency loss explained before (see Figure 8). Finally, for tt resonances with mass above 1000 GeV/c\({}^{2}\), the mass spectrum is not peaked any more on generated mass (Fig. 4).

A study of systematics on tt resonance mass due to mis-calibrated jets has been done. It results that a 1% miscalibration on b-jets induces an error on tt resonance mass as given in equation 7 :

\[\Delta M(GeV/c^{2})=0.34\cdot 10^{-2}M_{t\overline{t}}(GeV/c^{2})-0.32\cdot 10^{-1} \tag{7}\]

The effect of 1 % miscalibration on both b-jets and light jets is described by equation 8 :

\[\Delta M(GeV/c^{2})=0.359\cdot 10^{-2}M_{t\overline{t}}(GeV/c^{2})-0.212\cdot 10 ^{-1} \tag{8}\]

This tt reconstruction has been pursued with full simulated tt sample [13]. As shown in Figure 15, the overall shape of the SM tt mass spectrum is identical for both simulations. This demonstrates that the fast simulation reproduces quite well the detector response and could be used to generate large samples of tt events. In addition, it should be noticed that the generators used in both cases were different : Pythia for the fast simulation and MC@NLO for the full simulation.

## 4 Discovery potential

### Modus operandi

The discovery potential is estimated in a simple way by using a sliding window over the invariant mass spectrum. Under the hypothesis that the produced resonances have a gaussian shape with a width \(\Gamma_{ns}\), the average number of events expected in a range mass \(dm\) is :

\[n_{res}(m)dm=\mathcal{L}\varepsilon_{res}\,Br_{td decay}\left(\sigma\cdot Br\right)_{ns}\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}\cdot\Gamma_{res}}e^{- \frac{1}{t}\left(\frac{s-u_{ns}}{\Gamma_{res}}\right)^{2}}dm \tag{9}\]

where

* \(\mathcal{L}\) : integrated luminosity
* \(M_{res}\) : average mass of tt resonance
* \(Br_{tddecay}=0.29\) : branching ratio of decay channels \(t\overline{t}\to bjjb\mu\nu_{\mu}\) and \(t\overline{t}\to bjjbe\nu_{e}\)
* \(\varepsilon_{res}\) : reconstruction efficiency of tt resonances

In order to have a model independent discovery potential, the width of the gaussian shape can not be taken as the width of the spectrum generated by Pythia 5.7 which depends on the implemented Technicolor model. So, the hypothesis is made that the resonance width \(\Gamma_{res}\) is smaller than the ATLAS mass resolution \(\Gamma_{det}\). Such resonances will be reconstructed by the ATLAS detector with a width close to the experimental mass resolution. This is no more true for tt resonances with a width larger than the detector mass resolution. So, the discovery potential is estimated here only for narrow tt resonances.

In a window \(\pm\,\mathcal{D}t_{det}\) around the resonance mass, the number of signal events S could be expressed as :

\[S(M_{res})=\mathcal{L}\varepsilon_{res}\,Br_{td decay}\left(\sigma\cdot Br\right)_{ns}\alpha \tag{10}\]

with

\[\alpha=\int_{M^{-}}^{M^{+}}\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}\cdot\Gamma_{det}}e^{-\frac{1 }{t}\left(\frac{s-u_{res}}{\Gamma_{det}}\right)^{2}}dm\approx 0.9545 \tag{11}\]

In a window \(\pm\,\mathcal{D}t_{det}\) around the resonance mass, the number of SM tt events B could be expressed as :

\[B(M_{res})=n(M_{res})\frac{\mathcal{L}\varepsilon_{t\overline{t}}\sigma_{t \overline{t}}Br_{td decay}}{N} \tag{12}\]

withFigure 12: \(t\overline{t}\) invariant mass spectrum for left) SM \(t\overline{t}\) pairs, center) 800 GeV/c\({}^{2}\)\(t\overline{t}\) resonances, right) 2000 GeV/c\({}^{2}\)\(t\overline{t}\) resonances.

Figure 15: _SM normalized \(t\overline{t}\) mass spectrum for fast and full simulation._

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:12]

* \(n(M_{rts})\) is the number of SM t\(\overline{\rm t}\) events contained in the \(\pm\,\)\(\oplus\,\)\(\ell_{det}\) window
* \(N\) is the total number of SM t\(\overline{\rm t}\) events
* \(\varepsilon_{t\overline{\rm t}}\) is the SM t\(\overline{\rm t}\) pairs reconstruction efficiency
* \(\sigma_{t\overline{\rm t}}=833\) pb is the production cross section of SM t\(\overline{\rm t}\) pairs

To setup the resonance discovery, at least 10 resonant events [3], S=10, are required in a window \(\pm 2\ell_{det}\) around the resonance mass. So, \((\sigma\cdot Br)_{res}\) for a given mass should be larger than :

\[\boxed{\left(\sigma\cdot Br\right)_{res}(M_{res})>\left(\sigma\cdot Br \right)_{res}^{min}(M_{res})=\frac{10}{\frac{E_{res}B_{t_{fitin}}\alpha}{\sqrt{B (M_{res})}}}}. \tag{13}\]

The statistical fluctuation of the SM t\(\overline{\rm t}\) events within a given window has to be computed to deduce the 5 \(\sigma\) significance. It is roughly taken as \(\sqrt{B(M_{res})}\) and the discovery potential is deduced from the significance \(\frac{S(M_{res})}{\sqrt{B(M_{res})}}\) as :

\[\boxed{\left(\sigma\cdot Br\right)_{res}(M_{res})\geq\frac{5}{\varepsilon_{ res}\alpha}\sqrt{\frac{\varepsilon_{t\overline{\rm t}}\sigma\cdot r}{L\,Br_{ tin}}\frac{n}{N}}} \tag{14}\]

The discovery potential plot is obtained using equations 13 and 14.

### Detector resolution (\(\Gamma_{det}\))

To obtain the average resolution of ATLAS detector as a function of the mass, the difference between \(\eta_{\rm techni}\) reconstructed mass and \(\eta_{\rm techni}\) generated mass is computed for every batch of \(\eta_{\rm techni}\). The spectrum is fitted with a gaussian : the standard deviation is taken as the ATLAS resolution. The cuts applied to obtain the resolution are those described before except the constraints on the reconstructed Top quark mass (equations 3 and 6) which are not taken into account. This allows to have a better determination of the resolution. However, to eliminate the tail at small invariant mass produced when the resonances were generated, the \(\eta_{\rm techni}\) generated mass is requested to be in a window centered on the average mass within 8 times the generated width. Results are shown in Figure 16 in addition to the associated fitted function. These results are compatible with the expected performances of the ATLAS detector.

Reconstruction efficiency of non-resonant t\(\overline{\rm t}\) pairs (\(\varepsilon_{t\overline{\rm t}}\))

_A priori_, the reconstruction efficiency of SM t\(\overline{\rm t}\) pairs has no reason to be the same as the one of t\(\overline{\rm t}\) resonances (Figure 14). The determination of the reconstruction efficiency of SM t\(\overline{\rm t}\) pairs has been also computed for the same mass windows. The reconstruction efficiency of SM t\(\overline{\rm t}\) pairs is lower than for the resonance (Figure 17). The applied cuts are optimized for possible t\(\overline{\rm t}\) resonances. The phase space for SM t\(\overline{\rm t}\) pairs don't sprawl to high momenta, this is the reason why the reconstruction efficiency of SM t\(\overline{\rm t}\) pairs is zero above 3000 GeV/c\({}^{2}\). Moreover, the few generated SM t\(\overline{\rm t}\) pairs with a mass higher than 3000 GeV/c\({}^{2}\) are eliminated by the reconstruction method which is not adapted to high mass t\(\overline{\rm t}\) pairs (as outlined previously).

### Discovery potential

Putting all ingredients into equation 14, we deduce the 5 \(\sigma\) discovery potential of t\(\overline{\rm t}\) resonances for an integrated luminosity equal to 30 fb\({}^{-1}\) and 300 fb\({}^{-1}\) (Figure 18). The value of \((\sigma\cdot Br)_{res}^{min}\) (dot line) changes with the resonance mass due to the variation of the reconstruction efficiency for t\(\overline{\rm t}\) resonances. From 2500-3000 GeV/c\({}^{2}\) according to the luminosity, \((\sigma\cdot Br)_{res}\) reaches the lower limit \((\sigma\cdot Br)_{res}^{min}\) because only few SM t\(\overline{\rm t}\) pairs are produced with these invariant masses. These results are compatible with a previous fast study [3]. This method is only adapted for narrow resonances, with a width lower than the detector resolution.

Conclusion and prospects

This study allowed to determine the values of \(\sigma\cdot Br\) for a 5 \(\sigma\) discovery potential of a narrow \(\mathrm{t\overline{t}}\) resonance using Atlas and Fortran framework. For example, with 300 \(fb^{-1}\), a 500 GeV/c\({}^{2}\) resonance could be discovered provided that its \(\sigma\cdot Br\) is at least 1500 \(fb\). This value decreases to 650 and 11 \(fb\) for resonance masses at respectively 1 TeV and 3 TeV.

It has been shown that a special reconstruction method should be applied to increase the efficiency in the search for resonance above 1.5-2 TeV.

This preliminary work must now be pursued using full reconstructed events within the Athena framework. In this context, a kinematical fit [4] can be used to constrain the \(\mathrm{t\overline{t}}\) events and reduce the combinatorial background.
