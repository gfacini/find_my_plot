###### Abstract

Simulations based on DTUJET93 and FLUKA94 have been carried out in order to evaluate the background rates in the detectors and in the experimental hall. The different contributions of neutrons, e\({}^{+}\)e\({}^{-}\), photons, charged hadron and muons are considered separately. Shielding to reduce the large flux of neutrons and photons is proposed, and its effect in a few different configurations is simulated.

## 1 Introduction

The proposed new hadron collider at CERN (LHC) will require very high luminosities to be able to detect the physics signals of interest. These will give rise to an enormous rate of p-p collisions whose effects on the detectors has to be carefully studied.

Problems are connected both with radiation damage and pile-up [1], and with the possibility of significant radiation induced backgrounds in the muon system.

Therefore, an extensive effort to evaluate the background in and around the ATLAS detector and to devise a solution for shielding the experiment has been made.

We present here a selected set of the many simulations that have been performed, in various detector and shielding configurations, from january 1993 up to now. During these months, the detector and machine parameters have undergone many changes, as will be described in more detail in section 3 of this note.

Details of the code used and of the simulation parameters are given in section 2.

Results are provided both in tabular form and in maps with isolevels. In all isolevel maps the plotted quantity are the particle flux and the absorbed dose rate, which are the only quantities that can be correctly defined over whole volumes, since their definitions do not include any dependence on specific surfaces or orientations. Moreover, the flux is the quantity directly connected to most physical values, such as interaction probability and energy deposition, and it is a measure of the length of the particles paths inside a given volume.

The background in the hall is one of the main constraints on the muon chamber layout and operation. For this reason, we present also tables with detailed values of the background at the surfaces of the muon chambers superlayers. These values should be more directly connected to the rate of events induced in the chambers. For neutral particles, with no continuous energy depositions, the hit rate is related to the interaction probability, thus we quote again the flux values. For charged particles, however, which have a continuous energy loss, the track length has no relevance for the detection probability. It can be assumed that each charged particle that enters the chambers is detected, thus for charged particles we quote the particle currents across the chamber surface.

Background levels are also required to estimate the radiation damage hazard for front end electronics (calorimeters and inner tracking) and for inner silicon detectors. To this end, we givealso maps of absorbed doses, neutron and charged hadron fluxes integrated over one year of LHC activity, assuming that one year corresponds to \(1\cdot 10^{41}cm^{-2}\) of yearly integrated luminosity. Note that in these specific maps neutron fluxes are calculated with a lower threshold of 100 keV, since radiation damage studies on silicon devices[13] lead to the conclusion that neutrons below this threshold are almost harmless.

The strategy followed when designing the shielding against the hall background is based on few guidelines: (see also Appendix C)

* High density material ( Stainless Steel, Cast Iron, Copper...) of reasonable cost has been adopted for the bulk of the shield, to dump the high energy component of the background as much as possible in the available space. HeavvyMetal has been sometimes used, despite of its high cost, when no sufficient space was available.
* After that, a layer of hydrogenated material is essential to moderate and possibly capture medium and low energy neutrons which escape in large number from medium and high Z materials ( a typical thickness is 15 cm).
* A third layer, at the top of the shield, made of Lead or other high Z material, is intended to effectively attenuate the capture photons which are an important component of the background, as shown in Appendix C. The thickness of this layer corresponds to a couple of attenuation lengths for photons in the Compton minimum.

## 2 Details of simulations

All the calculations have been performed with the code FLUKA. Details about the code and its physical models, as well as benchmarks for both electromagnetic and hadronic applications can be found in [2, 3, 5, 4, 6, 7, 9, 8, 12, 11].

The minimum bias events to be used as a source in FLUKA have been generated using the code DTUJET93 [10].

A major problem in these calculations is the huge amount of CPU time needed to follow all secondaries of a 14 TeV event down to near-zero energy in a geometry composed by hundreds of different regions. FLUKA, however, allows to use a variety of variance reduction techniques to increase the speed maintaining a good statistics. Different ways of biasing and weighting depending on particle type, position and energy lead to dramatic reduction of CPU time, at the price of losing correlations among different physical quantities, but exactly preserving the average values of any scored quantity. As a result, the CPU time needed for each simulation is of the order of 24 hours on a typical workstation, that is around one order of magnitude less than an unbiased GEANT calculation for the same problem.

For each major setup separate runs have been performed to determine background levels in the inner detector/calorimeters and those in the hall, to optimize the weighting techniques. Moreover, in all the calculations previous to the integration of the Very Forward calorimeter in the End Cap one (configurations. 3-30 of section 3), the background in the hall has been calculated as sum of the separate contributions of the punchthrough from the calorimeters and of the particles interacting in the rest of the hall. This allowed to model the Barrel and End Cap Electromagnetic calorimeters as black holes when simulating the outer environment, which means that any particle entering the EM calorimeters was immediately stopped. This is no longer meaningful in the last geometries, where the Forward calorimeter has been integrated into the End Cap cryostat; as a consequence, because of the tiny aperture left (rs 7 cm ), the distinction between punchthrough particles and particles coming directly from the interaction point is ambiguous.

For old configurations we will omit the results relative to background in the inner detectors/calorimeters and to punchthrough, because they have been computed with obsolete designs of the detectors, and cannot be compared with the present ones.

The geometrical layout used for the inner tracking and calorimeters, up to the first muon chambers, is shown in fig. 1.

The ATLAS detector is supposed to be composed by:

* Inner detector, with Silicon and TRD layers.
* Electromagnetic calorimeter, Lead-liquid argon Barrel and End Cap
* Hadronic calorimeter: Tiles ( iron-scintillator) in Barrel and Extended Barrel and Copper-liquid Argon in the End Cap
* Very Forward calorimeter (see section 3).

Figure 1: ATLAS inner tracking and calorimeters

* muon chamber system : three superlayers of muon chambers both in the barrel and in the forward region.
* magnetic field devices : a solenoid in front of the EM barrel calorimeter for the inner tracking, with a Fe return joke outside the hadronic barrel calorimeter. The muon analysing magnetic field is given by a barrel and a forward air-core toroids.

All the simulated dimensions are as close as possible to reality. Homogenous materials have been used for the calorimeters, keeping the right proportion of constituents.

A schematic magnetic field is included in the calculations, with rough fringe effects for the barrel toroid and no fringe in the forward toroid: we assumed a perfect solenoidal 2 T field in the central cavity; an azimuthally symmetric field with a maximum value of 1 T and a radial shape approximating that described in the Letter of Intent (see fig 4.3 at page 51) for the barrel toroid; and a uniform 1.4 T toroidal field in the forward toroid.

Particle transport thresholds have been kept at low values in the most recent (TP) calculations: 30 keV for photons ( 300 keV in older simulations), 0.5 MeV for electrons (1 MeV in older simulations), 1 MeV for charged hadrons and muons, while neutrons are followed down to thermal energies.

## 3 Simulated Setups for the Hall background

The design of the ATLAS detector has undergone a continuous evolution, partially also because of background reasons. What we present here is an attempt to follow this evolution, that helps in understanding which are the main background sources.

The following general assumptions have been adopted ( the z-axis is parallel to the beam and the origin of the coordinate system is the nominal interaction point):

* The copper quadrupole collimator ( we call "collimator" what is actually the shield of the quadrupole against secondaries from p-p collisions) was assumed to have an inner diameter of 3 cm and an outer radius of 20 cm
* Muon chambers and their supports have been modelled as homogeneous layers
* The peak luminosity was assumed to be 1\(\times\)10\({}^{34}\) cm\({}^{-2}\)\(s^{-1}\), with an inelastic cross section of 80mb (_please note the change in peak luminosity with respect to all meeting presentations_).
* The experimental hall has a cylindrical shape with a 13 m. radius.

A few other parameters underwent a single, sharp, change in correspondence with the integration of the Forward Calorimeter ( TP, see below)

* Muon Chambers composition: Aluminum and plastics before, Aluminum with reduced density (one thirtieth of the normal density) afterwards.
* The hall was formerly assumed to extend from -2200 to +2200 cm around the interaction point, while in the updated geometry it goes from -2400 cm to +2400 cm.
* The collision energy has been lowered to 14 TeV from the original 16 TeV.

The main differences with respect to the original [14] design concern the forward region, where three possible configurations have been proposed (see figs. 2,3,4 ):

**LoI**: _Letter of Intent configuration_

* The End Cap coverage was assumed to go down to \(\eta=3\)
* The Very Forward Calo (VF) was assumed to start at z=1500 cm and to be 200 cm long with an inner radius of 15 cm and an outer one of 200 cm. Lead-Scintillator was assumed for the VF material.
* The collimator was assumed to start at z=1750 cm and to be 150 cm long, with an inner diameter of 3 cm and an outer radius of 20 cm
**Ni**: _Non-integrated_: The Very Forward is mounted "around" the quadrupole collimator: * The collimator is now placed inside the VF calo starting at 1600 cm and ending at 1790 cm
* The VF calo starts at 1540 cm and ends at 1790 cm with an inner radius of 20 cm
* The End Cap coverage was assumed to go down to \(\eta=3\) or \(\eta=3.5\) depending on shield configuration.
**TP**: _Integrated_: * The Forward calorimeter (now called IFC : Integrated Forward Calorimeter) is placed inside the End Cap, closing it up to \(\eta\approx 4.8\) and using the same cryostat. It is supposed to be divided in three longitudinal sectors, the first made of Liquid Argon and Copper, the others made of LAr and Tungsten.
* The quadrupole collimator is 200 cm long.

This configuration is the tentative setup for the Technical Proposal.

The "starting point" with no shielding and configuration LoI for the forward region will be indicated, for historical reasons and for uniformity with results and tables presented at various meetings, as configuration number 3. The results for the background fluxes are reported in the tables 1-15 and 16-30 for this configuration and the other ones described below. The map of fluxes and doses, together with some examples of spectra, are collected in the Appendices.

Some comments on the numbers reported in tables 1-30 and the associated statistical errors is perhaps worthwhile. The reported values and errors represents the average and the standard deviation computed out of the results of typically ten independent runs. Standard deviations are computed in the usual way and their meaning is implicitly dependent on the assumption that the fractional errors are small. As standard practice in any statistical analysis with MonteCarlo events, the following guidelines should be kept in mind when judging values and associated errors:

* errors \(<10\%\): this errors are reliable and give a realistic estimate of the uncertainty associated with the computed values
* \(10\%<\) errors \(<20\%\): the uncertainty associated with the computed values is probably underestimated
* \(20\%<\) errors \(<40\%\): the computed values are accurate within a factor of a few
* \(40\%<\) errors \(<60\%\): the computed values are likely to be in the right order of magnitude

### Configuration 8 : LoI-like, optimized but unrealistic

From a first look at the flux distributions for the unshielded geometry ( 3), it was immediately evident that the main background source is the collimator, followed by the beam pipe. Various shielding schemes have been tested. The main characteristics of the best performing configuration (n.8) were:

* A thick shielding of the collimator/quads region consisting of a layer of iron going from R=20 to R=150 cm, followed by 15 cm of polyethylene and 5 cm of lead.
* A polyethylene/lead lining of the outer faces of the VF calo
* A shielding cone extending from \(\eta=2.7\) to \(\eta=2.9\), made by iron (\(\eta=2.76-2.9\)), polyethylene (\(\eta=2.708-2.76\)), and lead (\(\eta=2.7-2.708\)). The cone is extending from the iron yoke up to the VF.
* A conical beam pipe.

### Configuration 12, new starting point for Ni geometry

Apart from the location of the collimator inside the VF, it is the same as configuration 8.

### Configurations 20-30

These configurations (Ni) share the following common features (VF and collimator positions are the same as for configuration 12 unless differences are explicitly stated).

* The End Cap coverage has been extended down to \(\eta=3.5\). However, most of the simulated shielding setups do actually require coverage down to 3.2 only.
* A corrugated/undulated Stainless steel beam pipe has been assumed with 12 cm diameter and 0.3 mm thickness, according to a real thickness of 0.2 mm and a 50% increase due to undulations. The VF calo radius has been reduced to R=180 cm (\(\eta=2.85\)) due to the previous point
* The muon chamber acceptance was fixed to \(\eta=2.9\)
* The forward toroid coils have been assumed to start around \(\eta=3\) with a copper shielding 15 cm thick centered on the \(\eta=3\) line. No explicit modelling of the coils has been introduced for the moment.
* The same copper thickness and location has been assumed for the shielding cone before and after the toroid (please note that the copper layer never goes beyond \(\eta=2.9\), that is inside the muon chamber acceptance).
* A 7.5 cm thick polyethylene layer has been added on top of the copper shielding everywhere

Out of this general scheme many different configurations (20-30) have been tried:

* A 5 cm thick lead layer has been added on top of the poly layer everywhere in the shielding "cone" (also in the cold). Two 14.5 cm wide vacuum gaps have been left in the shielding at the start and the end of the forward toroid to take into account the vacuum insulation etc.

* 21 It is exactly like configuration 20, but without the vacuum gaps in the shielding.
* 23 It is again like configuration 20, but with the lead layer removed everywhere and substituted by an extra poly layer of the same thickness.
* 24 Like conf. 23, but with an additional vacuum pump, located at 8 metres from the interaction point, that weights approximately 80 kg.
* 25 As 23, but the quadrupole collimator has been substituted by " Black hole" absorbing all particles, to evaluate the contribution of this part to the total background.
* 28 As 23, but without the beam pipe
* 29 As 23, but with Black Hole in place of the very forward calo.
* 30 As 23, but with an Aluminum (instead of Stainless Steel ) beam pipe
* 26 As 21, but the Cu shield has been extended downwards to \(\eta=3.5\), doubling its thickness, to fully exploit the End Cap coverage.
* 27 As 26, but with the Copper shield substituted by Tungsten

### Discussion relative to LoI and Ni configurations

Results are reported in tab. 1-15. _Particles traversing the EM calorimeters are not included in these values_, as already explained.

A careful inspection of the tables shows that:

* The resulting fluxes in configuration 8 were much lower than the unshielded ones (reduction factor larger than 100), however the muon chamber acceptance was cut to 2.7 and there was actually no room left for the forward toroids whose coils and cryostat must extend beyond the nominal chamber acceptance. The results for this configuration are also reported in tables 1-15. Please note that for this particular configuration the real upper boundary for the forward scoring surfaces was 2.7 and not 2.9 as stated in the tables.
* There is no significant difference between configuration 8 and 12. That is the new location of the collimator (inside the VF) does not introduce differences. This is true of course for the given shielding, for the unshielded configuration striking differences are expected in the last (3rd) forward layer (it should be lower because of partial shielding of the coll. by the VF) and in the other forward layers (they should be higher because of increased backsplash from the VF/coll assembly).
* All the "realistic" configurations 20-23 are worse than n. 8 and n. 12 by a factor of the order of two.
* The 15 cm thick copper shielding of conf. 20-23 is clearly insufficient to effectively attenuate the hard component of the neutron background. This is demonstrated by the increased neutron flux presented by all configuration with lead when compared with configuration 23, which can be explained assuming that the hard component is still "buildupping" in the shield at the lead layer depth.
* The effect of the vacuum gaps (compare 20 with 21) is there but it is not dramatic. Within the present statistics we can conclude it is less than a factor two.

* While configuration **23** is the best for neutrons (among 20-23) ones) it is the worst for photons. This is easily explained by the lack of the lead layer which is quite effective in shielding from capture gammas.
* The inclusion of the vacuum pump ( 24 vs.23) raises the levels of neutron and gamma fluxes roughly of 50% everywhere
* Most of the radiation from the machine elements is attenuated and the residual effect is estimated to be about 20-30 % of the background, mainly coming from backsplash from the front face and some leakage at the FC-shield interface (**25** vs. **23**).
* Beam pipe **23,28,30**: a plain cylindrical beam pipe of a few mm thickness would be the largest source of background radiation once the copper collimator were properly shielded. Assuming an undulated/corrugated beam pipe of "effective" thickness of 0.3 mm Al ( **30**), the beam pipe induced background is about 30 % of the total one. A careful design of the beam pipe and related equipment (flanges, valves, pumps) must therefore be recognized as a key point.
* The Forward Calorimeter is a source of background mainly through backsplash from the front face and lateral leakage. The latter is negligible unless the original radial dimensions will be reduced, i.e. because of a larger coverage of the End Cap calorimeters. The effect of the FC is about 20% of the total( **29** vs **23**): however it is difficult to distinguish between its effect and the one induced by the collimator because in the present set-up the Cu collimator is located inside the FC.

### configurations TP1-TP5 : realistic with Integrated VF

Results for these configurations are reported in tables 16-30. _Please remember the lower threshold for photons with respect to older setups (30 keV vs 800 keV), which accounts for a typical 30% difference in fluxes. However the difference in actual hit rates is much smaller because of the small efficiency of chambers for photons in the extra energy range considered._

Different shielding schemes have been tested in the Integrated Forward configuration. They differ among themselves only in the shielding inside and below the Forward Toroid (FT), while they share the other features:

* There are a shielding plate after the End Cap HAD calo made of Copper, in the cold, and a shielding plug still in the cold, after the Integrated Forward Calo (IFC) made of HeavyMetal (W-Cu-Ni). The Iron yoke in the frontal region which was originally foreseen, is now removed. Only a 3 cm thick iron plate has been left.
* The shielding plug just below the 1st Forward SuperLayer (FSL) is made of HeavyMetal.
* The shielding from the Forward Toroid (FT) to the end of the hall is made of Iron plus a 15 cm CH\({}_{2}\) layer plus a 5 cm lead layer going towards larger radii (up to the line \(\eta=3\)).
* All shielding inner boundaries (including the cold and warm HeavyMetal plugs), up to the collimator, are aligned on the \(\eta=4.6\) line. After the collimator the shield inner radius is 40 cm.
* The inner radius of the FT cryostat is assumed to be R=60 cm.

Different shielding designs have been tested:

**TP1**: No shielding inside the Forward toroid, and a multilayer shield below it: Fe (outer radius 47 cm), CH\({}_{2}\), (outer radius 57 cm), Pb (outer radius 60 cm).
**TP2**: No shielding inside the Forward toroid, and a multilayer shield below it: HeavyMetal (outer radius 47 cm), CH\({}_{2}\), (outer radius 57 cm), Pb (outer radius 60 cm).
**TP3**: A 15 cm thick Polyethylene layer in the FT cryostat, HeavyMetal below it from \(\eta=4.6\) to a radius of 60 cm.
**TP4**: As TP3, but with 10 cm of Lead in the FT instead of poly. It is unrealistic, but very useful to understand the role of different shielding materials.
**TP5**: A 30 cm thick Polyethylene layer in the FT cryostat, a Copper shield below it from \(\eta=4.6\) to a radius of 60 cm.

### Discussion on TP configurations

The resulting fluxes deserve a few comments. The thick shielding around collimator and quadrupoles is very effective. Despite the tremendous amount of energy deposited in such components now their influence on the total background rate is small, as can easily recognized looking at the isoflux lines reported in Appendix A. It must be stressed that no significant reduction of this shield is affordable. Indeed a careful inspection of the isoflux lines for TP 5 shows how the present shield is able to reduce the background induced by the Cu collimator and other machine elements, at a level just below of that induced by other components.

The overall background rate is dominated by particles leaking in the region of the Forward Toroid, where the shield outer radius is limited by the FT cryostat, and the inner one is limited by the danger of intercepting particles not shadowed by the calorimeters. Again this can be clearly recognized looking at the isoflux lines for all TP configurations.

For **TP 1**, a global flux of neutrons of 10-20 kHz/cmq is present in most of the hall, with larger rates for the 1st and 2nd FSL. For photons the flux is as usual roughly a factor 2 lower. It is obvious from a first look at the isoflux levels that a proper shielding of the FT area would bring the background levels to a substantially lower level than the present and past ones, fully exploiting the advantages of the IFC solution. Some non negligible contribution is coming from the particles escaping the calorimeters through the Barrel-Extended Barrel crack.

**TP 2** is intended to investigate the effectiveness of using the highest possible densities in the same shielding configuration of TP 1, that is with a shield completely inside the FT inner radius and nothing in the cold. The effect is roughly a factor two reduction on both photon and neutron fluxes. It must be stressed that the use of expensive HeavyMetal assemblies for such a large shield is unrealistic and must be regarded just as an exercise to understand the problem.

**TP 3** fully exploits the available space inside the FT toroid for a bulk shield made again of HeavyMetal A 15 cm thick polyethylene layer is now placed in the cold inside the FT cryostat. No lead layer on top is foreseen to avoid to spoil the muon momentum resolution at the highest rapidities because of multiple scattering. The same considerations of TP 2 about the feasibility of such HeavyMetal shield do apply. The effect on neutron fluxes is very substantial with respect to TP 1 and also TP 2, while the one on photons is smaller because of the lack of a layer effective in shielding capture photons.

**TP 4** is an unrealistic but very useful exercise of a shield which maximizes the amount of material in g/cm\({}^{2}\), but without efficient neutron moderation capabilities. This configuration is indeed the worst for neutron fluxes, despite the thickest shield in term of interaction lengths. The situation for photons is more complex. Indeed photon fluxes are given both by photons escapingfrom regions where showering does occur, and from capture photons generated all around the hall by background neutrons. The thick high-Z shield of this setup is very effective in shielding the first "direct" component, but completely fails with the second one as expected because of the inefficiency in neutron shielding. Indeed the "direct" photon bump in the FT area is strongly suppressed but the overall background due to captures is still there, and in a few barrel and 3rd FSL positions the photon fluxes are slightly worse than those of TP 2.

**TP 5** is a fairly realistic setup. While maintaining the FT cryostat inner radius at 60 cm, it fully exploits the inner space for a Cu (for magnetic reasons) bulk shield and allows for a 30 cm polyethylene shield in the cold, inside the FT cryostat. Such a shield is fully feasible [16] and does not cause serious deterioration of the momentum resolution at the highest rapidities. Inspection of flux maps shows that TP 5 is very effective for both neutrons and photons with results quite comparable to TP 3 (the smaller amount of heavy material being compensated by a larger thickness of polyethylene). Probably a better result for photons could be obtained if the use of a top layer of heavy material were not prevented by muon multiple scattering considerations.

A general conclusions which can be drawn both from tables 16-30 and from the flux maps is that the whole 3rd FSL is located in a region of relatively low and slowly changing background.

A mild gradient is also present along the 2nd FSL, but for muons and charged hadrons which are concentrated at the highest rapidities. However their flux is about a factor ten below the one in the corresponding position of the 1st FSL.

### Punchthrough versus hall induced background

We recall that for punchthrough we mean all background coming from the detector, including real punchthrough, decay in the central cavity and streaming through cracks and other apertures. For punchthrough calculations the geometry was stopped at R=530 cm and Z=740 cm, so TP 1-5 are all equivalent from this point of view.

As already mentioned, the Copper and HeavyMetal cold plugs are present to reduce punchthrough and related background. The cracks between Barrel and Extended Barrel tiles and between Extended Barrel and End Cap are partially (75%) closed by thick iron plugs. The behaviour of the punchthrough as a function of \(\eta\) is shown in figs. 5,6,7,8, while numbers integrated over the same interval as for the full background are reported in tables 16-30 under the name PU 1.

The effect of the cracks is evident, together with the strong increase of charged particle fluxes at the highest rapidities. Among these, muons are very difficult to reduce. Their spectrum, integrated over \(2.3<\eta<3\), is shown in Appendix C. The hardness of such a spectrum renders unaffordable any reduction strategy based on a plain thickening of the calorimeters and/or shielding plates and plugs. A simple simulations carried out using this spectrum as input, showed that the expected reduction is of the order of 1% per extra cm of Copper. A careful comparison of the data reported in tables 16-30, shows indeed that the background in the 1st FSL is punchthrough dominated for the last 0.7 unit of rapidity in all configurations. However it is also clear that quite significant contributions are coming from sources other than punchthrough for all the rest of the 1st FSL and for the whole 1st BSL. In this respect a careful optimization of the shielding in the FT area, which is the main source of background in the hall, will have a strong impact also on the first layer, but possibly the very last rapidity interval.

It is worthwhile to stress that among the contributions to the high rates expected for the highest rapidity region of the 1st FSL, only that related to muon is "irreducible". Photon and neutron fluxes are mainly due to low energy particles streaming in the vacuum gaps of the End Cap cryostats, as shown by the maps reported in Appendix B, and could be effectively attenuated by the (re)introduction of an iron plate of enough thickness after the End Cap. Electrons and charged hadrons would also be significantly affected by such an extra shielding.

## 4 Levels in the inner detector and in the calorimeters

Some shielding has been devised also inside the calorimeters, being careful not to spoil the detector resolution with big amounts of material. In this context, the old (see [14, 1]) polyethylene layer in front of the EM barrel calorimeter has been eliminated. There remain a 5 cm thick poly layer in front of the End Cap calorimeter and a 20 cm thick one in front of the Integrated Forward. No boron-enriched polyethylene is used, _because the effect of Boron in a high energy neutron field worsens the background instead of reducing it_, on the contrary of what is claimed for example in [17]. Maps of isodose and isoflux lines in the inner detectors and calorimeters are presented in Appendix D. The effect of the cracks is evident, together with the fact that the backsplash from the Integrated Forward into the inner cavity is negligible, provided the 20 cm thick polyethylene layer stays in.

No spectrum is presented in this note, however the information is available if there is such a need.

## 5 Conclusions and final comments

About the effectiveness of the IFC solution in reducing the background, we feel useful to clear misunderstandings which went around in the last months. It has been assumed in many circumstances, (see [15]), mainly on the basis of the simulations carried out by the Arizona group, (and similar for set up to those described in [17]), that the IFC solution should give a factor ten reduction in the background. By looking at our results, however, it appears that the "plain" IFC solution (for example TP 1) is similar to, and in some points significantly worse than, the non integrated one setups **8, 12** and **23/30**. The explanation of such an incongruence lies in two assumption, made in [15] and [17], which were not correct:

* What was assumed to be the non integrated baseline setup, was indeed a mix of the DICE geometry available at that time and a tentative shielding description, grossly underestimating our requirements. The actual baseline for the non-integrated geometry (for example setups 12 and 23/30), were much more performing and established since a long time (see for example the milestone document, the meeting with ATLAS referees on may '93, and the ATLAS workshop on background in the muon system at the end of january '94).
* To compute the background for the integrated setup the (very reasonable) assumption was made that the space constraints of the FT were the same as for the non integrated solution. However, in the actual design most of the space made available for shielding was actually taken by the FT team to change from conical to cylindrical the inner cryostat wall and to improve the magnetic coverage.

Whenever consistent assumptions were used in both our and other group calculations (see for example [18]), comparable results were obtained.

The only integrated setup which starts to be comparable or slightly better of the best non integrated ones is TP 5.

However these considerations should not be meant as a criticism to the statement that the integrated solution is very advantageous for background. We are fairly convinced that with this solution there is now quite a lot of room for further optimization and improvements, while no significant further reduction could be expected from the non integrated setups. However this optimization is just at the beginning and most of the space originally available for shielding was indeed used for other purposes (Forward Toroid). Hopefully part of the effect of this missing shield could come back by free, when all the actual FT material will be taken into account in the calculations.

Summarizing, within the present constraints, the best "realistic" configuration considered is TP 5. Therefore it has been adopted as a starting point for the next iterations, looking for further reduction factors which could allow to approach the desired level of background. However it must be taken into account that for the time being the background level in the muon system is not yet significantly lower of what has been discussed and presented many times over the past two years.

A further comment is required about the problem of background in the Forward muon chambers, since this is a very important item in the discussion of different muon chamber technologies. Any strong assessment is premature, but there are a few fixed points, namely:

* The muon flux at the highest rapidities in the 1st FSL is can be hardly reduced, and it is strongly dependent on \(\eta\). An effort will be pursued to effectively reduce the other components, with good probability of success.
* Concerning the 3rd FSL. Detailed informations as a function of \(\eta\) are meaningless for this layer, due to the obvious lack of any strong gradient in the background (see the maps). The computed levels are anyway already low, and also the increase in muon and charged hadron rates integrated over the last interval is such that cannot accomodate any dramatic effect at the largest \(\eta\).
* The situation for the 2nd FSL is somewhat unclear and needs further clarifications: however the presented numbers for TP 5 are not very large and might be furtherly reduced.

No particular comment is required about the computed dose and particle levels in the Inner Cavity and Calorimeters. They do not show any significant change with respect to past calculations. Maybe that some slight modifications could occur once the final ID and beam pipe/pump geometry will be plugged into the calculations.

## Appendix A: background levels in the hall

We collect here flux maps for a few of the discussed configurations. We feel useful to present a short summary of their major characteristics in tab. 31.

The isolevel lines are plotted in a logarithmic scale, full lines corresponding to integer powers of 10, short-dashed lines to one third of decades ( a factor 2.15) and long-dashed lines to two thirds of decade ( a factor 4.64). Units are \(kHz/sec\).

We recall that, apart from geometrical aspects, the TP configurations have been simulated with lower thresholds than in the previous ones; the effect of this is negligible for electrons and causes an increase of the order of 30% for photons. Moreover, TP configurations fully include the punchthrough from the calorimeters, while in older configurations (3-30) all particles impinging on the EM calorimeters were swallowed by the black hole.

## Appendix B: punchthrough-only maps in TP configuration

The contribution of punchthrough from calorimeters can be estimated from these maps. Isolevel curves are plotted as in appendix A.

## Appendix C: background spectra in the hall

Background spectra are interesting because they cast some light on the origin and composition of background. Particularly useful is the comparison between punchthrough and hall spectra. We show here neutron, electron, \(\gamma\), muon and charged hadron spectra in two selected positions: at central rapidity and in the very forward region. For most of them we present spectra obtained both in the complete calculation and in that performed for inner detector/punchthrough. The spectra are plotted in lethary units: \(E\cdot\Phi(E)=dN/d(log(E))\), and are normalized to one minimum bias event.

In all neutron, photon and electron spectra two components can be isolated: a hard one, coming from incomplete containment of the showers produced in the detectors and in the shieldings by minimum bias particles, and a soft one, mainly due do rescattering in the hall. This difference is evident looking at the different shape of spectra with and without inclusion of the hall in the geometry. In the low energy region, all radiation species are linked together: neutrons are scattered around and finally captured, thus causing the emission capture gammas which on turn travel in the hall and produce secondary electrons. Typical energies of capture gammas are from a few MeV down to few tens of keV.

## Appendix D: radiation levels in the detectors

The maps included here correspond to configuration TP, and the graphical presentation is the same as in Appendix A. Units are \(\mbox{$\mathit{particles}$}/\mbox{$\mathit{cm}^{2}$}/\mbox{$\mathit{year}$}\) or \(\mbox{$\mathit{kGy}$}/\mbox{$\mathit{year}$}\). Only neutrons with energy greater than 100 keV have been scored, for the neutron map.
