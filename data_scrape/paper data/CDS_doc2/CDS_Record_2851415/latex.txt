Search for high-mass resonances in photon plus missing transverse momentum signatures in \(pp\) collisions at \(\sqrt{s}=13\) TeV with the ATLAS detector

The ATLAS Collaboration

A search for high-mass resonances from heavy Higgs "H" bosons in photon plus missing transverse momentum signatures produced in proton-proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy of \(\sqrt{s}=13\) TeV at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is presented. Both the gluon-gluon Fusion (\(ggF\)) and the Vector-Boson Fusion (\(VBF\)) production modes of the heavy Higgs bosons are considered using the total LHC Run-2 integrated luminosity of 139 fb\({}^{-1}\) recorded by the ATLAS detector. The RECAST strategy is adopted to reinterpret the previous ATLAS mono-photon \(\gamma+E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}\) result in the context of the search for dark photons from heavy Higgs bosons decay. The results of this reinterpretation are presented in terms of exclusion limits on the cross-section times the branching ratio for heavy Higgs boson masses ranging from 400 GeV to 3 TeV. For a massless dark photon, the exclusion limits at 95% confidence level on the \(\sigma\times BR(H\to\gamma\gamma_{d})\) obtained using the combined \(ggF+VBF\) production of the heavy Higgs boson are found to be in the range from 1.44 (1.68) fb to 24.2 (28.1) fb observed (expected) respectively. The highest limit corresponds to a heavy Higgs boson with a mass of 400 GeV and the lowest limit corresponds to the heaviest considered mass of 3 TeV. Limits for separate \(ggF\) and \(VBF\) production modes as well as intermediate heavy Higgs boson masses are provided.

## 1 Introduction

There is strong astrophysical evidence suggesting the existence of dark matter (DM) with a density about five times higher than ordinary baryonic matter [1]. However, its fundamental nature is unknown and it is plausible that it is a component of a larger "dark sector", which is weakly coupled to the Standard Model (SM) and possesses a rich internal structure and interactions. Existing models propose a dark sector that contains few or many particles, some providing ideal candidates for DM. The interaction of these dark states can be Yukawa-like or mediated by dark gauge bosons or both depending on the model.

The dark sector may communicate weakly with the visible sector through a portal interaction linking gauge invariant SM operators to a mediator offering a potential experimental signature [2; 3; 4]. The search for dark photons can be performed according to two scenarios depending on their theoretical framework: massive or massless dark photons. The former received more attention as it couples directly to SM currents giving rise to accessible final states [5; 6; 7; 8; 9]. The massless case arises from the kinematic mixing of \(U(1)_{D}\) and \(U(1)\) and can be investigated at the LHC in agreement with all existing constraints [10; 11; 12].

Moreover, looking beyond particle physics, dark photons may solve the small-scale structure formation problems [13]. In astroparticle physics, dark photons may induce the Sommerfeld enhancement of the DM annihilation cross-section needed to explain the PAMELA-Fermi-AMS2 positron anomaly [14].

This study reports a potential discovery process for dark photons proceeding via heavy Higgs bosons (\(H\)) decay in the ATLAS detector. Thanks to the non-decoupling properties of the Higgs boson, a branching ratio of \(H\to\gamma\gamma_{d}\) with values up to a few percent are possible for a massless dark photon as well as for heavy dark-sector scenarios [10; 15; 16]. For a heavy Higgs boson with a mass ranging from 400 GeV to 3 TeV, the corresponding signature consists of a photon with an energy \(E_{\gamma}=m_{H}/2\) in the heavy Higgs centre-of-mass frame and a similar amount of missing transverse momentum (\(E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}\)) which originates from the escaping \(\gamma_{d}\)[16].

The photon plus \(E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}\) signature has been extensively studied by the LHC experiments [17; 18; 19]. In the particular case of massless \(\gamma_{d}\), searches in Higgs boson decays were performed at the LHC in \(pp\) collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV. The CMS collaboration has probed this decay channel using Higgs boson events produced in association with a \(Z\) boson \(ZH(Z\to\ell^{+}\ell^{-})\) with an integrated luminosity of 137 fb\({}^{-1}\)[20], or via vector-boson fusion (VBF) production [21] (with 130 fb\({}^{-1}\)) setting an observed (expected) upper limit on the BR(\(H\to\gamma\gamma_{d}\)) at the 95% confidence level (CL) of 4.6% (3.6%) and 3.5% (2.8%) respectively. Using an integrated luminosity of 139 fb\({}^{-1}\), the ATLAS experiment has set an observed (expected) limit on the \(H\to\gamma\gamma_{d}\) branching ratio at the 95% CL, to 1.8% (1.7%) using the VBF production mode [22] and to 2.3% (3.8%) considering the \(ZH(Z\to\ell^{+}\ell^{-})\) production mode [23].

This search is based on the reinterpretation of the ATLAS mono-photon results [17] using the RECAST software framework (Request Efficiency Computation for Alternative Signal Theories) [24], in the context of the search for heavy Higgs bosons decay to a photon and a massless dark photon. This allows to reuse the same background estimates and systematic uncertainties as well as observed data of the original analysis to test alternative hypotheses.

The introduced signal model includes both the gluon-gluon Fusion (\(ggF\)) and the \(VBF\) production modes of the heavy Higgs bosons as presented in the Feynman diagrams shown in Figure 1. Following the strategy of the mono-photon analysis, to improve the sensitivity of this search, different signal regions (SR) are considered based on the missing transverse momentum \(E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}\) selections ranging from 200 GeV to 375 GeV, being the primary observable of this search.

The results of this reinterpretation are presented in terms of 95% CL exclusion limits on the \(\sigma\times BR(H\to\gamma\gamma d)\), considering separate \(ggF\) and \(VBF\) production modes as well as the combined \(ggF+VBF\) production for different heavy Higgs boson masses: 400, 600, 800, 1000, 1500, 2000, 2500 and 3000.

## 2 The \(\gamma+E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\) search

An overview of the \(\gamma+E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\) search [25] based on the full Run-2 dataset collected with the ATLAS experiment is presented in this section. The aim is to look for an excess of events with a \(\gamma+E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\) final state over the SM prediction, which offers a clean signature to search for new physics processes that include extremely weekly- or non-interacting particles, leading to \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\) in the final states.

### Event selection

All the events in the analysis must satisfy beam, detector and data-quality criteria. They are selected by a trigger requiring at least one photon candidate with transverse energy \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\gamma}\) above a threshold of 140  and passing 'loose' identification requirements [26]. Events are required to satisfy the selection reported in Table 1, more details concerning these criteria can be found in [25]. To improve the sensitivity of the analysis, seven SRs are defined corresponding to different \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\) ranges: four inclusive (SRI1-SRI4) and three exclusive (SRE1-SRE3).

### Background estimates and results

The SM background in the various SRs arises from several processes that generate real photons and from events in which one or more energetic jets or electrons are misidentified as photons. The latter are estimated through the use of control samples including jets or electrons, scaled by misidentification rates determined from data. The background with real photons is dominated by the \(Z(\to\nu\nu)\gamma\) process, secondary contributions come from \(W(\to l\nu)\gamma\) and \(Z(\to ll)\gamma\) production with unidentified electrons, muons or with hadronically decaying \(\tau\) leptons and from \(\gamma\)+jets events. These contributions are obtained using Monte Carlo (MC) simulations constrained by observed event counts in dedicated control regions (CRs) through the estimation of normalisation factors. Control regions are built by inverting one or more of the selection criteria used to define the SRs, allowing one of the background processes to become dominant but otherwise kinematically similar to the given SR. The contribution of these backgrounds is determined separately for each SR, as defined in Table 1, with a maximum-likelihood fit, referred to as the 'background-only fit'. This procedure constrains the normalisation of the dominant backgrounds to the

Figure 1: Feynman diagrams for H\(\to\gamma\gamma_{d}\) in \(ggF\) (right) and \(VBF\) (left) production modes.

observed event yields in the associated CRs, assuming that no signal is present in the CRs and including the background contribution from the misidentification of electrons and jets as photons estimated with data-driven techniques. The inputs to the fit for each SR include the number of events observed in its associated CRs and the number of events predicted by simulation in the SR and CRs for each background process. The latter is described by Poisson statistics. The systematic uncertainties are included in the fit as nuisance parameters, modelled by Gaussian distributions with widths corresponding to the sizes of the associated uncertainties. Using a simultaneous fit technique allows a straightforward combination of multiple CRs and permits a coherent treatment of the correlation of the systematic uncertainties across the different regions. The product of the various probability distributions forms the likelihood, which the fit maximises by adjusting the background normalisation and the nuisance parameters.

Since the shape of BSM signal models over multiple \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\) bins is different from the background prediction, a'simplified shape fit' is applied in the CRs associated to the exclusive SRs plus the inclusive SR corresponding to the highest \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\) range (SRI4) shown in Table 1. This allows normalisation factors for the background contributions in each \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\) bin to be extracted by exploiting the \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\) shape information and it is used to set exclusion limits on the considered models when no excess is found in the data.

The background-only simultaneous fit is performed to evaluate the SM background expectations in all regions of the analysis. The event yields in data are consistent with the SM expectations within uncertainties in all signal regions. The observed number of events and the expected SM background contribution resulting after performing the'simplified shape fit' are reported in Table 2[25]. The values of the normalisation factors for \(W/Z+\gamma\) and \(\gamma+\mathrm{jets}\) backgrounds are also shown.

The total uncertainty ranges from 3.5% to 9.5% depending on the SR. The purely statistical uncertainty is dominant, varying from 2.4% to 8.5% and driven by the statistical precision from the CRs adopted to constrain the normalisation of the leading \(Z(\rightarrow\nu\nu)\gamma\) background. The relative impact of each source of systematic uncertainty on the total SM background estimates is summarised in Table 3[25]. A large experimental uncertainty is related to jets misidentified as photons and varies from 1.4% to 4.1%. The impact of the uncertainty in the jet energy scale and resolution varies from 1.6% to 2.7%. The uncertainty related to electrons misidentified as photons varies between about 2% and 2.3%. Other experimental systematic uncertainties related to electrons, photons, muons and the \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\)'soft

## 3 Description of the signal model

In the search for high mass resonances from heavy Higgs bosons in \(\gamma+E_{\text{T}}^{\text{miss}}\) final states carried out in this note, the phase-space defined by the reinterpreted mono-photon analysis leads to dominant contributions from both \(ggF\) and \(VBF\) production processes as shown in Figure 1. For both these processes, dedicated MC generators are used to simulate and model the signal events, at a centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV following the configurations shown in Table 4. The heavy Higgs boson decay to a photon and a massless dark photon \(H\to\gamma\gamma_{d}\) is handled assuming the Hidden-Valley dark photon scenario [27] implemented in Pythia since 8.150 version.

The signal events produced via \(ggF\) are generated using Powheg v2 NNLOPS [28; 29; 30; 31; 32] with the CT10 set of parton distribution functions (PDFs), calculated at NNLO accuracy in \(\alpha_{\text{s}}\). The simulation was interfaced with Pythia 8.306 using the CTEQ6L1 PDF set and the AZNLO underlying-event tune to handle the heavy Higgs boson decay, the parton shower and the non-perturbative hadronization effects. The \(ggF\) prediction from the MC samples is normalised to the next-to-NNLO cross-section in QCD plus electroweak corrections at NLO [33; 34; 35; 36; 37; 38; 39; 40; 41; 42; 43]. In addition, a filter is applied at the generator level requiring events to contain one photon with a \(p_{\text{T}}>120\) GeV and \(|\eta|<2.5\).

The other signal production process is through \(VBF\). Signal events from this production mode were generated with matrix elements calculated using Powheg v2 [44; 45] at NLO accuracy in \(\alpha_{\text{s}}\), using the PDF4LHC15_nlo_30_pdfas set of PDFs [46]. In addition, Pythia 8.306 [47] was used with the dipole recoil shower variable [48] turned on, to perform the heavy Higgs boson decay as well as the parton shower and the non-perturbative hadronization effects with the CTEQ6L1 PDF set and the AZNLO underlying-event tune. Moreover, at the generator level, a filter is applied to require events with \(E_{\text{T}}^{\text{miss}}\) higher than 75 GeV.

The samples of both \(ggF\) and \(VBF\) processes were generated with the total width of the Higgs boson set to the SM value of 4 MeV [49] and the complex pole scheme [50] turned off. A total of eight MC samples per production process were generated with heavy Higgs boson masses equal to 400, 600, 800, 1000, 1500, 2000, 2500 and 3000 GeV.

The generated events were processed through a simulation [51] of the ATLAS detector geometry and response using Geant4 [52], and through the same reconstruction software as the collected \(pp\) collision data. Corrections were applied to the simulated events so that the particle candidates' selection efficiencies, energy scales and energy resolutions match those determined from the data control samples. The simulated samples are normalised to the total integrated luminosity assuming their cross-sections, computed to the highest order available in perturbation theory as given in Table 5[33]. The detector response was simulated using a fast parameterised simulation of the ATLAS calorimeters [53] and the full Geant4 simulation is used for the other sub-detectors.

Theoretical uncertainties:Signals from \(ggF\) and \(VBF\) are considered for the computation of the theoretical uncertainties in each SR bin of the analysis as shown in Table 1. As no dependence on \(E_{\text{T}}^{\text{miss}}\) has been noticed, the estimates in the most inclusive SR11 (\(E_{\text{T}}^{\text{miss}}\) > 200 GeV) have been considered.

Theoretical uncertainties include uncertainties on the NLO cross-section due to the QCD factorisation and renormalisation scales [54] as well as the choice of parton distribution functions. Uncertainties on initial- and final-state radiations due to the choice of parton shower (PS) parameters used with Pythia 8.306 are estimated by generating MC samples with the alternative tunes described in Ref. [55]. The uncertainties for both production processes and for each mass point are summarised in Table 6. Since some information needed to calculate theoretical uncertainties was missing in the samples \(m_{H}\) = 400 GeV, 2500 GeV,

## 4 Reinterpretation results

The reinterpretation of the Run-2 \(\gamma+E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\) search is performed using the RECAST framework, including the heavy Higgs boson signal decaying to a photon and a massless dark photon into the simultaneous likelihood fit described in Section 2. The signal experimental and theoretical uncertainties are considered in the fit as nuisance parameters. The background estimation has been obtained providing to the fit the same inputs of the \(\gamma+E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\) analysis. To illustrate the shape of the different \(H\rightarrow\gamma\gamma_{d}\) signals in the SR, their \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\) distributions have been superimposed to the expected SM background and data after performing the'simplified shape fit' as shown in Figure 2. Signal acceptances for \(ggF\) and \(VBF\) processes in the SRs used in the'simplified shape fit' are shown in Table 7.

Exclusion upper limits at 95% CL on \(\sigma\times BR(H\rightarrow\gamma\gamma_{d})\) are obtained performing the'simplified shape fit' including both the SRs and their associated CRs by means of the HistFitter package [56]. These limits are based on the profile-likelihood-ratio test statistic and CLs prescriptions [57], evaluated using the asymptotic approximation [58]. Results for the heavy Higgs boson signal produced via \(ggF\) and \(VBF\) separately as well as through a combination in which the two processes have been merged proportionally to their relative theoretical cross-sections [49]\(ggF\)+\(VBF\) are shown in Figure 3 for the considered Higgs mass values. The theoretically predicted cross-section of a heavy Higgs boson produced via \(ggF\) or \(VBF\) is superimposed assuming a \(BR(H\rightarrow\gamma\gamma_{d})\) = 0.05. Table 8 summarises the observed and the expected exclusion limits at 95% CL on \(\sigma\times BR(H\rightarrow\gamma\gamma_{d})\) for \(ggF\) and \(VBF\) separately as well as for the combined productions \(ggF\)+\(VBF\). The relative impact of the signal theoretical uncertainties on the exclusion limits is below 11.5% for the \(ggF\) process and below 2.5% for the \(VBF\) process considering all mass samples, while the signal experimental uncertainties have an overall impact below 7% for both processes.

## 5 Conclusion

The reinterpretation of the ATLAS full Run-2 \(\gamma+E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}\) search using the RECAST framework is performed in the context of the production of a heavy Higgs boson decaying to a photon and a massless dark photon. Dominant contributions coming from both gluon-gluon Fusion (\(ggF\)) and Vector-Boson Fusion (\(VBF\)) production modes and different mass hypotheses for the heavy Higgs boson have been considered. The Higgs mass spans from 400 GeV to 3 TeV to probe the sensitivity of the \(\gamma+E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}\) search towards the \(H\to\gamma\gamma_{d}\) signal. Exclusion upper limits on the cross-section times the branching ratio for \(H\to\gamma\gamma_{d}\) are provided for both production modes \(ggF\) and \(VBF\) separately and for the combined \(ggF+VBF\) processes for the considered Higgs masses. The exclusion limits at 95% confidence level for the \(ggF+VBF\)\(H\to\gamma\gamma_{d}\) are found to be in the range from 1.44 (1.68) fb to 24.2 (28.1) fb observed (expected) respectively, with the highest limit corresponding to a heavy Higgs boson with a mass of 400 GeV and the lowest limit corresponds to the heaviest considered mass of 3 TeV.
