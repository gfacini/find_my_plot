**Abstract**

We have studied the fraction of the energy of the QCD jets produced at LHC which is undetected by a calorimeter. The neutrinos are obvious candidates as undetected particles; the muons go through the calorimeter as minimum ionising particles and are a source of unseen energy for this type of detector. The energy taken by the muons is recovered with the help of the tracking system and the muon chambers which surround the detector. We give the fraction of the energy of the QCD jets which is taken by neutrinos, muons and both type of particles.

Introduction

The jet energy defined by the energy flow in a cone around the jet direction is affected by several uncertainties:

1. the fragmentation effects which depend on the nature of the jet: light quark, heavy quark or gluon.
2. the fraction of the total energy carried away by non interacting particles: neutrinos and muons.
3. the magnetic field of the detector which sweeps out of the cone the low \(P_{t}\) particles.
4. the pile-up energy from the underlying minimum bias events at the highest luminosity.

In this note, we present a study on the fraction We have studied the variation of the opening angle of the jet cone at the interaction point which contains the jet energy with the \(P_{t}\) of the initial parton. This angle is defined by the variable \(\Delta R=\sqrt{\Delta\eta^{2}+\Delta\phi^{2}}\) which is half the cone angle. For two values of the angle, \(\Delta R=0.5\) and \(1\), we look for the fraction of the total energy carried by neutrinos and muons in QCD jets. If the muons are undetected particles for the calorimeter, the Atlas detector can measure the muon momentum in a very safe way using the muon chambers after at least 12 interaction lengths and the toroide magnet. The only case where the muon momentum may be difficult to measure is when the muon track is in a jet due to the soft punch through particles in muon chamber.

## 2 Events sample

For the study of the undetected energy in the QCD jets, we generate QCD events using the PYTHIA 5.5 generator with standard option for the QCD jets. We restrict the rapidity of the generated jets to \(\pm\) 1. To produce in an efficient way jets of high \(P_{t}\), we impose different \(P_{t}^{\rm min}\) cuts to the scattered partons. We generate sample of events with the following \(P_{t}\): 50, 150, 500, 1000, 2000 GeV/c of \(P_{t}\).

## 3 QCD process

At the Born term, six process are identified for the production of high \(P_{t}\) jets:

1. \(q_{t}q_{2}\to q_{1}q_{2}\)
2. \(q_{1}\bar{q}_{2}\to q_{2}\bar{q}_{4}\)
3. \(q\bar{q}\to gg\)
4. \(qg\to qg\)
5. \(gg\to q\bar{q}\)
6. \(gg\to gg\)

The figure 1 displays the variation of the cross section of the different process with the \(P_{t}^{\rm min}\) of the scattered parton. The cross section of the production of jets is dominated by the process involving gluons at low \(P_{t}\) (till 500 GeV of \(P_{t}\)) and by the two process involving quarks at high \(P_{t}\)\(qg\to qg\) and \(q_{1}q_{2}\to q_{1}q_{2}\) due to the harder structure function of the quark compare to the gluons.

## 4 Reconstruction and selection of the jets

We use the algorithm of the Lund package LUCELL to reconstruct the jet axis. The energy of the particles of the event is loaded in table according their coordinates \(\eta\) and \(\phi\). We take a binning of 0.06 \(\times\) 0.06 in \(\Delta\eta\times\Delta\phi\). The jet algorithm looks for the highest \(E_{\rm t}\) cell and adds the surrounding cells in a cone of half angle \(\Delta R\); the selected angle is 0.5. The coordinates of the jet axis are the barycenter of the cells associated to the jet. The associated cells are killed and the algoritm is iterated.

For our study, we select isolated jets to avoid the splited jets which are more frequent at high \(P_{t}\). This type of jets needs a more sophisticated algorithm to associated the particles of the events to the jets.

For each \(P_{t}^{\rm min}\) cut, we have selected the jets having a \(P_{t}\) comprise 25 and 75 GeV/c, 75 and 250 GeV/c, 250 and 750 GeV/c, 750 and 1500 GeV/c, and greater than 1500 GeV/c, to avoid the introduction of a weight between the different data samples. The figure 2a,b,c,d,f display the mean value of the fraction of total energy contained in a cone of \(\Delta\)R for QCD jets and the RMS of these distributions (all the QCD process). The normalisation is the energy contained in a cone of \(\Delta\)r=1.

To see the difference between the gluon jets and the quark jets in the Lund generator, we display on figure 3a,b,c,d the preceding distributions for the jets produced by the process 1 and 6 for two \(P_{t}^{\rm min}\) 100 GeV/c and 1 TeV/c. The distributions of the ratio \(P_{\it{particle}}/E_{\it{jet}}\) for the particles of the preceding sets of data are displayed on figure 4a,b,c,d. For the 100 GeV/c there is a quite substancial difference between quark and gluon jets produced by the standard JETSET 7.3 generator.

## 5 Unseen energy in the jets

We add the energy of all the particles in a cone of half angle \(\Delta R\) and the energy taken away by the neutrinos and the muons. The figure 5 (6) displays the fraction of jets having more than 1, 5 or 10 % of their total energy taken away by neutrinos and muons for an angle of the cone \(\Delta R\) = 0.5 (=1). The two figures 7 and 8 give the fraction jets having more than 1, 5 or 10% of the deposited energy in a calorimeter taken away respectively by the neutrinos or by the muons for an angle of the cone \(\Delta R\) = 0.5. The deposited energy is defined as the total energy minus the energy taken away by neutrinos and muons. The origine of the neutrino and muons is the production of heavy flavored particles which decay in the semi-leptonic mode.

## 6 Conclusion

The shape of the three curves can be explained by the fact that at low \(P_{t}\) the gluon process dominates. In the low \(P_{t}\) jets, the fragmentation fonction of the b quark is hard; so the particle which contains the heavy quark takes most of the momentum of the heavy quark. In first approximation, each heavy flavored particle produced in a gluon jet takes approximatively half the momemtum of the initial gluon. At hight Pt, the process involving quarks dominate. The scattered quark must radiated a hard gluon in order that a pair of heavy quarks is produced in the in a high \(P_{t}\) jet. The fragmentation fonction are softer when the \(P_{t}\) of the parton increases. So the momentum of the heavy flavored particle is much lower that the momentum of the initial quark due to the intermediate step.

We must have in mind that the fraction of jets having a heavy flavor quark is much higher for the jets produced by weak process than for the jets produced by strong interaction.
