## 1 Introduction

This document summarizes the Standard Model summary plots with the inputs available at 19/03/2021. The scripts for the creation of these plots are available at [1].

## 2 Updates since Spring 2020

Since the last publication of these summary plots [2], the following results have been updated:

* **EW \(Z(\ell\ell)jj\)** at 13 TeV with full Run 2: The fiducial cross section results are available at 139 fb\({}^{-1}\) (previous measurements were only at 3.2 fb\({}^{-1}\)) [3].
* \(\gamma\gamma\) at 13 TeV: Results are now available with full Run 2, using an integrated luminosity of 139 fb\({}^{-1}\)[4].
* \(W^{+}W^{-}+\geq\)1 jet at 13 TeV: Results are available with full Run 2 [5].
* \(\gamma\gamma\to WW\) at 13 TeV: Results are available with full Run 2 [6].
* **VBF \(H\to WW^{+}\)** at 13 TeV: The cross section measurements are available with full Run 2 dataset (previous results were only at 36.1 fb\({}^{-1}\)). [7].
* \(H\to\gamma\gamma\) at 13 TeV: The fiducial cross section are measured with full Run 2 dataset (previous results were only at 79.8 fb\({}^{-1}\)) [8].
* \(H\to\tau\tau\) at 13 TeV: The total cross section has been measured using an integrated luminosity of 36.1 fb\({}^{-1}\)[9].

Figure 2: Summary of several Standard Model total production cross section measurements, corrected for branching fractions, compared to the corresponding theoretical expectations and ratio with respect to best theory.

Figure 4: Summary of several Standard Model total and fiducial production cross section measurements from Run 1, corrected for branching fractions, compared to the corresponding theoretical expectations. In some cases, the fiducial selection is different between measurements in the same final state for different centre-of-mass energies \(\sqrt{s}\), resulting in lower cross section values at higher \(\sqrt{s}\).
