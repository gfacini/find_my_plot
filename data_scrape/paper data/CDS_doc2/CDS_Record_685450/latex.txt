The ATLAS liquid argon electromagnetic end-cap calorimeter is under construction. During the module production, electrical tests are done to qualify each of them before integration. In the following note, these tests and their goals are described. Results obtained for the first five production modules are presented and discussed.

Introduction

The ATLAS ElectroMagnetic End-cap Calorimeter (EMEC) [1] consists in 16 modules grouped in two coaxial wheels as shown in Figure 1. Each module is made of 96 (32) absorber-spacer-electrode-spacer layers in the outer (inner) wheel. They are stacked and cabled in two institutes, CPPM1 and UAM2, sent to CERN for a cold test at liquid argon temperature and finally assembled in the wheel.

Footnote 2: Universidad Autónoma de Madrid

Several electrical tests are carried out to control and validate each production module:

* high voltage tests (HV), at the stacking site and at CERN, to check the voltage holding of the gap between electrodes and absorbers,
* low frequency tests (TBF), on the electrode during the stacking, to check the correct distribution of the high voltage and the electrical continuity of the signal readout,
* gap capacitance measurements (CAPAGAP), at the end of the stacking, to electrically control the gap thickness uniformity and the mechanical assembly quality,
* cell capacitance and inductance measurements, after stacking, to map the module readout characteristics for future signal reconstruction [2, 3],
* cold electronic resistive network measurements, during cold tests, to check the resistance values and their small dispersion (0.1%),
* cell response measurements with calibration pulses (TPA), during cold tests, to check cable continuity and signal output shape.

This note, after a general description of the hardware given in section 2, presents measurements done on the first five production modules. Section 3 is dedicated to the results obtained on the stacking sites while section 4 presents the results obtained at CERN.

## 2 Test bench descriptions

The tests, labeled HV, TBF, CAPAGAP and TPA, are performed with similar test benches located at each stacking sites and at CERN. These benches result of a collaboration between three French laboratories : CEA DSM/DAPNIA3, CPPM1 and LAMP4. For example, Figure 2 shows the Marseille setup in the stacking room. It is based on:

Footnote 1: Centre de Physique des particules de Marseille

Footnote 2: Universidad Autónoma de Madrid

Footnote 3: Commissariat à l’Energie Atomique

Footnote 4: Laboratoire d’Anney-le-Vieux de Physique des Particules.

* A computer (PC) with a GPIB bus which controls the electronic modules. The software is written in Labview (5.1 at CERN and 4.01 at stacking sites)[4, 5], as well as an important part of the analysis programs. The original software, written for the barrel[6], was modified to fit the EMEC module characteristics.

* A crate with a custom VME-like base plane and controller board (IGPIB)[7], power supplies and several electronic boards:
* a MUXCAPA board[8] used as a low frequency sinusoidal signal generator for the TBF test and as a multiplexer for the CAPAGAP test,
* a TBF board[9] which distributes the low frequency signal,
* MUX boards[10] which multiplex readout signals, with respectively 2(25) boards for the TBF(TPA) test,
* a TPA board[11] which generates input signal for the cell response measurements,
* a CQHT board[12], which is a secure multiplexer for the HV and TBF tests.
* A digital oscilloscope[13] used to readout signals from the TBF or TPA tests.
* A 30MHz bandwidth RLC meter[14] used in the CAPAGAP test.
* A computer controlled power supply[15], with a 10 nA current sensitivity.

At the stacking sites, the connection to the module is made through a patch panel fixed on the module structure as shown on Figure 3, and through a baseplane on the cryostat at CERN (see section 4).

The cell gap capacitance and inductance measurements are performed with a simple setup involving a portable PC, a custom C-software[16], a GPIB bus, a RLC-meter (the same as for CAPAGAP) and an interface socket.

The cold electronic resistive network measurements are done through a baseplane on the cryostat at CERN with a simple setup composed of a portable PC, a custom C-software[16], a GPIB bus, a 64 channels multiplexer board[17] and a digital multimeter[18].

## 3 Results on the stacking site

During the stacking, the following sequence is adopted for the electrical tests5:

Footnote 5: Sagitta measurements on the last mounted absorber are also performed as well as geometrical controls on the structure.

* a HV test after each stacked gap,
* a TBF test at the end of the day,
* a HV test during the night on the last nine mounted electrodes,
* a HV test during the week-end on the last 24 stacked electrodes.

The two last tests were added, after the fourth production module, to avoid problems induced by the absorbers load. At the end of the stacking, a HV test is performed on all the electrodes. For some of the accepted modules, a CAPAGP test is carried out and cell capacitance and inductance measurements are done.

Figure 3: _Module back side with the patch panel fixed on its structure._

### High voltage tests

These tests are usually performed with the test bench described in section 2, which allow the recording of current profiles. But for technical reasons, the first four modules were tested during the stacking with a CAEN power supply[19] (less accurate but faster) while the test bench was only used at the end of the stacking.

Figure 4 shows a schematic view of the HV side of flat electrodes. High voltages are distributed on both electrode sides named HV1 and HV2. The high voltage settings vary, by step, with \(\eta\)[1]. In the outer (inner) wheel, there are seven (two) high voltage sectors. Technically, only six different values of high voltage are available from the Lecroy power supplies, thus the same value of 2500 V is chosen for the sectors 1 and 2 of the outer wheel.

As an example, high voltage sector current measurements are given in Figure 5 for four outer wheel electrodes (F to B6) connected together and for one inner wheel electrode (B7, B8). The electrode and the associated gaps behave like capacitances charged during the HV ramp up (\(\frac{\Delta V}{\Delta t}\)). The ramp up is set between 5 and 11 V/s with respect to the number of tested electrodes. During the voltage increase, the measured current (\(I\)) is almost constant and corresponds to the charged capacitance (\(C\)) which is related to the HV sector surface, the liquid argon gap and the electrode capacitance. When the voltage reaches its nominal value, the current decreases following a \(1/RC\) law.

Figure 4: _Outer and inner wheel flat electrode schematic views. Sampling regions are represented as well as high voltage sectors. High voltage values are indicated for each sector at liquid argon temperature._

### Low frequency test

This test checks whether some electrode connectors and resistors have been damaged during transport and/or handling in the clean room (a similar test is performed after the electrodes bending). In order to increase the signal to noise ratio and therefore to improve the measurement quality, signal cells are grouped. Figure 6 shows an outer and an inner wheel flat electrode schematic view with the defined TBF channels:

* In the outer wheel :
* 37 front channels with a summation by 8, 6 or 4 strips depending on the granularity.
* 14 back channels with a summation by four \(S_{2}\) cells and two \(S_{3}\) cells for \(\eta=[1.5,2.5]\) and to the summation of one \(S_{1}\) cell and one \(S_{2}\) cell for \(\eta=[1.375,1.5]\) (region with only two samplings).
* In the inner wheel :
* 5 back channels: three with a summation by one \(S_{2}\) and one \(S_{3}\) cells (channels: 2, 3 and 5), and two with a summation by two \(S_{2}\) and two \(S_{3}\) cells (channels: 1 and 4).

The principle is to send a low frequency sinusoidal signal on the high voltage lines of an electrode to obtain an output signal on the signal layer by capacitive coupling.

Figure 8: _Mean kapton capacitances, for the 95 outer wheel electrodes and the 31 inner wheel electrodes of the first module stacked in Marseille, versus TBF channel number for the two high voltage sides. The minimal and the maximal values for each TBF channel are also represented. On figures a and b, the solid line represents the capacitance if one strip is missing._

Figure 7 shows typical input and output signals. Using two different frequencies (\(F_{1}\) and \(F_{2}\)), chosen to maximize the phase between the input and output signals, the coupling capacitance (_ie_ kapton capacitance) can be calculated with the following formula[20]:

\[C=\sqrt{\frac{(1/2\pi F_{1})^{2}-(1/2\pi F_{2})^{2}}{\rho^{2}((|E_{1}|/|S_{1}|)^{ 2}-(|E_{2}|/|S_{2}|)^{2})}} \tag{1}\]

where \(E_{1}\), \(S_{1}\), \(E_{2}\) and \(S_{2}\) are respectively the input and output signal amplitudes at frequencies \(F_{1}\) and \(F_{2}\) and \(\rho\) is the oscilloscope input resistance (1 M\(\Omega\)). The input signal amplitude, delivered by the MUXCAPA board, is constant (manually tunable) : \(E_{1}=E_{2}\sim 80\)V. Input and output waveforms are recorded from the oscilloscope and fitted by a sinuside to extract the signal amplitudes. \(F_{1}=0.8(0.53)\) Hz and \(F_{2}=4.0(2.5)\) Hz for the front (back) channels.

To pass successfully the TBF test, each channel must satisfy the following criteria:

* For the back channels, their kapton capacitance has to be within 10% of the mean kapton capacitance (\(C_{mean}\)) of the given channel, computed with all the electrodes of the first production module.
* For the front channels, each kapton capacitance has to be greater than the corre

sponding one with a missing strip: \[C_{mis}=\frac{i-1}{i}\times C_{mean}\] where \(i\) is the number of cells summed to create a channel (4, 6 or 8) In case of problem, the corresponding electrode is unmounted the next day and replaced by a new one. During the construction of the first five production modules, few electrodes have been rejected.

At the end of the stacking, the standard deviation (\(\sigma_{C}\)) and the extrema (\(C_{min}\) and \(C_{max}\)) of each channel are calculated to allow a complete analysis. Figure 8 shows the evolution of \(C_{mean}\), \(C_{min}\) and \(C_{max}\) as a function of the channel number for each high voltage side. Fine geometrical effects can be seen, like the change of granularity in the strips, which enable to detect easily the loss of one strip. Kapton capacitances are bigger for HV2 (right plots) than for HV1 (left plots). This is due to a glue layer that only exist between the HV1 and the signal layer. It was introduced during the making process of the electrodes. The ratio between the two kapton capacitances is stable around 0.9 (Figures 9a-b) and does not vary between modules (Figure 9c).

Similar results have been obtained for the other production modules. As an example, Figure 10a shows, for the first five modules, the mean kapton capacitance as a function of the HV2 front channel. Figure 10b is the distribution of the corresponding relative difference with respect to module ECC0 for the four other module

Figure 10: _a: Mean kapton capacitances, for the five first production modules, as a function of the front TBF channel number (HV2 layer). b: Distribution of the relative difference (in %) between the mean kapton capacitances of the module ECC0 and the other four modules, for the outer wheel front and back TBF channels._

modules \(\times\) 102 channels). It confirms that the mean kapton capacitances have no module dependence. Finally, Figure 11 shows the channel capacitance dispersion (\(\sigma_{C}/<C>\)) distribution for the modules built at Marseille and at Madrid. A similar mean value, around 2%, is obtained for the two stacking sites.

All these results have contributed to validate the stacking of the first five production modules. They have also confirmed the quality and the uniformity of the electrodes used.

### Capacitance and inductance measurements

Two measurements can be performed. The first one, called CAPAGAP, is done at the end of the stacking and only, for technical reason, at the Marseille site. It is a relative gap thickness measurement per electrode. The second one is done on some modules after the plugging of the summing boards. It is an absolute signal cell capacitance and inductance measurement.

#### 3.3.1 Gap capacitance measurements (CAPAGAP)

The goal is to control the gap thickness uniformity and identify possible geometrical problems after the module completion such as over thicknesses. The considered electrode regions are the high voltage sectors (Figure 4) except for the inner wheel where the two sectors are grouped. The capacitance between electrodes and absorbers (also called gap

Figure 11: _Distribution of the kapton capacitance relative dispersion (in %) of each tested TBF channels for the stacked modules at Marseille (on the left) and at Madrid (on the right)._

capacitance) is:

\[C=\frac{\epsilon S}{<d_{gap}>}\]

where \(S\) and \(<d_{gap}>\) are respectively the surface and the mean gap6 of the tested zone.

Footnote 6: As the gap thickness is varying with \(\eta\), the gap capacitance measured is an average over the considered sector surface.

Figure 12a shows the outer wheel gap capacitances as a function of the gap number. These results are obtained with the RLC meter set to a 150 kHz frequency and a 2V input amplitude. The MUXCAPA board is used as a multiplexer between the four RLC measurement points and each of the 8 regions. The gap capacitances are globally constant with the gap number in each sector, apart from a small 5% decrease, visible for the last gaps and explained by a limited load on the last absorbers. Results obtained on a half stacked module show the same behavior. The two sectors (F and B1) are not affected by this effect because of antiflexion pins, inserted on the transversal bars at the outer radius of the absorbers. On the contrary, the effect is maximum for sector B6 and is visible on the last 10 gaps. Similar results have been obtained for the inner wheel and for the other modules. Figure 12b represents the distribution of the relative difference between the measured gap capacitance and its mean value for ECC3 module. The contribution to the energy resolution constant term of the dispersion of gap thickness can be calculated (see Annexe B of [20]). A global dispersion of 2.3% is obtained for ECC3 that converts into a 0.3% contribution to the constant term. If the last gaps are removed, these figures

drop respectively to 1.9% and 0.18%, compatible with the required 0.15%[21]. Similar results are obtained for the other modules, which confirms the progress done in the module stacking since the full-size prototype module (module 0)[22], especially on the absorber sagitta due to a better control of the spacers thickness.

#### 3.3.2 Cell capacitance and inductance measurements

For some of the produced modules, at the end of the stacking and after the summing board plugging, absolute cell inductance and capacitance measurements are performed on the back side of the module (\(\eta=[1.5,3.2]\)). Four point phase measurements are performed by the RLC meter through a socket plugged on the summing boards. The socket contribution, measured to be 30 n H, is subtracted afterwards. A frequency (\(f\)) scan, 100 measures from 1 to 30 MHz, is performed and effective cell inductances (L) and capacitances (C) are extracted from the fit of the phase (\(\varphi\)):

\[\varphi=2\pi fL-\frac{1}{2\pi fC} \tag{2}\]

The precision obtained for the L and C values are typically of the order of a few percent.

Channel numbering in \(\eta\) (\(\eta_{C}\)) and \(\phi\) (\(\phi_{C}\)) is explained in Appendix A. All channels located on the back side of the detector are tested except some at \(\eta=2.4-2.5\) (only the region 7\(<\phi_{C}<\)27 is scanned because of the indexing ring) and in the inner wheel

Figure 13: _Cell inductances versus \(\eta\) in the outer (OW) and inner wheel (IW). In the inner wheel, no measurement exists for \(\eta_{C}=47\) in S2 and \(\eta_{C}=26\) in S3. Vertical dotted lines correspond to summing board separation._

(\(\eta_{C}=47\) in S2 and \(\eta_{C}=26\) in S3). All these values may be used as input for future calibration corrections [3].

Module ECC0 is the only one that has been tested so far. Ten channels7 have high/low values of C and L, compared to neighboring cells in \(\phi\), but without a correlation with the amplitude of the pulse taken in calibration. Therefore it can be either a bad plugging of the socket or a short circuit present on the summing board and corrected afterwards. On the contrary, two S2 channels (\(\eta_{C}\),\(\phi_{C}\))=(36,5) and (43,17) with respectively higher and lower cell capacitance, compared to the expected ones, exhibit lower and higher signal pulse (as expected).

Footnote 7: In S2: for (\(\eta_{C}\),\(\phi_{C}\)) = (20,2), (20,4), (20,10), (28,18), (28,19), C is higher and L lower. In S3: for (\(\eta_{C}\),\(\phi_{C}\)) = (8,2), (8,3), (8,4), C and L are higher, for (8,10) L is lower and for (10,7) C is higher.

Figure 13 shows the inductance as a function of \(\eta_{C}\) in S2 and S3 for four \(\phi_{C}\) values corresponding to the size of a summing board. Inductance vary from 20 to 40 nH in S2 and are below 15 nH is S3. This variation can be explained by the summing board strip length decrease with \(\eta\) (following the gap decrease). However, a clear improvement is observed compared to the preproduction module 0, as expected from the summing boards[22] redesign. Middle sampling regions \(\eta=[1.5,1.6]\) (channels 4 to 7) and \(\eta=[2.3,2.5]\) (channels 36 to 43) still exhibit an excursion up to 20nH, inside the same summing board, which is traced back to a variation of electrode connection strip lines.

Figure 14 shows the cell capacitance as a function of \(\eta_{C}\). A smooth behavior is observed for each sampling and values agree with expectations.

Figure 15: _Cell inductances (L) and capacitances (C) versus \(\phi_{C}\) for two different \(\eta_{C}\) in S2._

It is also interesting to look at the cell inductance and capacitance versus \(\phi\). Measurements are shown in Figure 15 for two different \(\eta_{C}\) values in S2 (channels 21 and 37). Inductance measurements of channel 21 (\(\eta\sim 1.9\)), show the same pattern each four channels (belonging to the same summing board). This is true for all channels in the region \(\eta=[1.8,2.1]\) (channels 16-28) and more study needs to be done to understand this problem. This pattern is not present for the other \(\eta\) regions, see for example the channel 37 (\(\eta\sim 2.3\)). In both case, the cell capacitances are slowly decreasing with \(\phi\) (variation of 8%), because the total load on absorbers decreases with \(\phi\). These results are in agreement with those obtained with the gap capacitance test8 (Figure 12a).

Footnote 8: One cell in \(\phi\) corresponds to three absorbers.

L and C relative dispersions to their mean values in \(\phi\), for a given \(\eta_{C}\), are computed. For this purpose, problematic channels are removed, as well as the two extreme \(\phi_{C}\) since their values are systematically below the mean value of C and L for a given \(\eta_{C}\). Combining all \(\eta_{C}\), the relative difference of cell inductances and capacitances are shown in Figure 16. It is less 2% for C in both samplings (closed to the 1.9 % obtained with the gap capacitance test) and around 5% for L in S2 (mainly because of channels located in the region \(\eta=[1.8,2.1]\)). The very large RMS obtained in S3 is explained by small inductance values.

## 4 Results obtained at CERN

Once the production module is cabled and validated at the production site, it is shipped to the north experimental area at CERN to be tested in liquid argon before its integration in the end-cap wheel. Four tests can be done: high voltage tests, cold electronic (mother boards) resistive network measurements, calibration and beam tests. The calibration test is performed with the TPA test bench in case of a"standard" cold test or with ATLAS-like front-end and calibration boards in case of beam test[23, 24].

After its arrival, the tested module is placed in a cryostat[25] equipped with two ATLAS-like front end crates (standard and special FEC), associated to three feedthroughs (FT0-2)9 which link the cold and warm electronics:

Footnote 9: The standard FEC is associated to FT0 and FT1 and the special FEC to FT2.

* FT0 covers the region \(\eta=[1.6,2.4]\) and \(\phi=[0,0.4]\),
* FT1 covers the region \(\eta=[1.6,2.4]\) and \(\phi=[0.4,0.8]\),
* FT2 covers several regions : \(\eta=[1.375,1.6]\) and \(\eta=[2.4,3.2]\) and \(\phi=[0,0.8]\).

### HV tests

After the arrival of a module at CERN and its installation in a clean room, HV tests are performed. Voltages are delivered by a CAEN high voltage power supply[19], located on the top of the cryostat, monitored by a PC in the control room. Voltage ramp up is done at 11V/s. All the outer wheel (inner wheel) electrodes are tested by group of 24 (16),corresponding to HV board segmentations. The first group of the outer (inner) wheel has only 23 (15) electrodes since its first electrode at \(\phi=1\) is missing.

Before the module insertion in the cryostat, a HV test is performed. Several HV values have been tried and the current situation is: HV values at liquid argon temperature (Figure 4) divided by \(\sqrt{2}\) or 2 depending if the signal is short-circuited to the mass on the baseplane or not. This allows to identify potential problems such as short cuts or disconnected HV channels. As an example, Figure 17 shows the electrode ramp up currents, at room temperature, for the four phi region, the two HV sides and the nine HV sectors in \(\eta\). A missing electrode can clearly be identified in the first \(\phi\) region. The sensitivity of the current measurement is also good enough to see a difference between the two HV sides linked to the extra glue layer on HV1. After filling up the cryostat with liquid argon, a test is carried out at the nominal high voltage values. Corresponding ramp up currents scale by roughly 0.85 on all sectors with respect to those shown on Figure 17 and the HV1/HV2 ratio increase. After module re-heating, possible problems are then cured in a clean room. The faulty electrode is isolated and a spare HV cable is added. After completion of these operations, a last HV test is performed before the storage of the module for future integration. Modules with at least one short at liquid argon temperature but not at room temperature and two other shorts on disconnected HV region at room temperature (and at liquid argon temperature) are tagged for future investigation. Modules not tagged are qualified for the integration.

Figure 17: _Electrode ramp up currents, at room temperature, for the four phi region, the two HV sides and the nine HV sectors in \(\eta\). B7 and B8 are the inner wheel regions. Electrodes are grouped by 24 but for \(\phi=1\) which is the HV board region with one missing electrode._

### Cold electronic resistive network measurements

During tests at CERN, signal output and calibration input resistances are mapped out at room and/or cold (liquid argon) temperature in the front end crate baseplane. A digital multimeter[18] assure this measurement through a 64 channel multiplexing electronic board plugged on the baseplane. Out of these measurements, the precise (10\({}^{-3}\)) mother board resistances can be checked out for possible problems.

Figure 18 is the equivalent diagram of the measurement. The measured resistances are \(R_{sig}\) at the baseplane signal output and \(R_{cal}\) at the baseplane calibration input:

\[R_{sig} = (R_{i\,n\,j}+R_{damp})+R_{term} \tag{3}\] \[R_{cal} = R_{term} \tag{4}\]

\(R_{i\,n\,j}\) is the calibration injection resistance. It is precisely fixed to about 450, 945 and 2940 \(\Omega\) with respect to cell capacitances. \(R_{damp}\) is fixed to 50 \(\Omega\). It adapts the mother board injection strip line to remove long ringing effects. \(R_{term}\) adapts, on the motherboard, the 50 \(\Omega\) calibration input impedance. It is computed, at cold temperature, as:

\[\frac{1}{50} = \frac{1}{R_{term}}+\frac{n}{R_{in\,j}+R_{damp}} \tag{5}\]

where \(n\) is the number of signal cells pulsed by the same calibration line. For the first tested modules, the measurements were performed at room temperature before and after

Figure 18: _Schematic diagram of the resistance network measurements._the module cooling and at cold temperature. Now they may be only performed after the module cooling and warm up once all identified problems have been cured.

As an example, Figure 19a presents the middle sampling resistance distribution at cold and room temperature. Dispersions of 0.04% and 0.05% are small for both temperatures. They are generally always smaller than the required 0.1% dispersion whatever the considered sampling. Figure 19b represents the distribution of the ratio between resistances measured at room and cold temperature and the ratio between resistances measured at room temperature before and after the module cooling. Results show that the cooling at liquid argon temperature implies a 2% shift for all resistances with no major increase in the dispersion. Moreover the cooling cycle does not introduce any degradation.

Tables 1 and 2 give typical \(R_{sig}\) and \(R_{cal}\) measured at cold and room temperatures, for different \(\eta\) regions of the front, middle and back samplings. The two different resistance values in the inner wheel sampling, are due to a different number of cells connected to the network from one calibration line to an other. A 5 \(\Omega\) contribution comes from the cables that link the mother boards to the feedthroughs. The calibration injection resistances can be calculated using Equation (3). The values obtained are in agreement with the expectation, as well as the ratio between samplings. In \(1.5<\eta<3.2\) region, we have for example:

\[\frac{(R_{in\,j}+R_{damp})(S1)}{(R_{in\,j}+R_{damp})(S2)}=6.004\,\sim 6\;\;\mbox{and}\;\; \frac{(R_{in\,j}+R_{damp})(S3)}{(R_{in\,j}+R_{damp})(S2)}=2.002\sim 2\]

Figure 19: _a: middle sampling resistance distribution for the standard feedthroughs at cold and warm temperature. b: distribution of the ratio between resistances measured at warm (before and after module cooling) and at cold._

Measurements have been carried out on several production modules and confirm the quality of the resistance networks used. Damaged networks have been found on some motherboards that have been replaced. Dead channels have been investigated and cured.

### TPA test

This test perform a crude calibration of the production modules. Therefore it checks their electrical continuity and the cabling quality. This test was replaced by the precise calibration done with ATLAS-like electronics for modules ECC0, ECC1 and ECC5 tested with a beam.

The principle is to send a 20V amplitude and 2ns rise time step signal produced by a 64 channels TPA board[11] through the cold electronic (mother boards and summing boards). Detector cells are only viewed as cell capacitance. The TPA boards are connected to the calibration slot of the FEC baseplane by AXON10 cables terminated by ATI connectors and ATI/VME interfaces as shown on Figure 20a-b. Then, cell responses are collected through AXON cables by 64 channels MUX boards as shown on Figures 20b-c.

Table 2: _Typical \(R_{cal}\) (in \(\Omega\)) measured at cold temperature for different \(\eta\) regions for the front, middle and back samplings. Numbers in brackets are measurement at room temperature._A total of respectively, 13 (12) MUX boards, with 50 (25) \(\Omega\) cables, are used to read out the front (back) channels. Appendix B gives for each ATI connector, the corresponding sampling, \(\eta\) region, number of cells and MUX board number. Relationship between TPA, MUX and cell numbers are in the cabling files used for the calibration performed during beam tests.

The output signal is collected by a digital oscilloscope[26] set with a 2ns time base. It averages 50 triggers to minimize the noise. The mean signal shown on Figure 21a is recorded and then analyzed. An analysis software shapes the output signal with a \(CR-RC^{2}filter\)[27, 28] (modeling of what is used in the FEB), and computes the maximal amplitude, \(A_{max}\), and the rise time, \(t_{p}\) as shown in Figure 21b. This test is performed feedthrough by feedthrough and sampling by sampling, at room and cold temperatures. Problematic channels are easily located by non expected \(A_{max}\) or \(t_{p}\) values (see Appendix C and Figure 21).

Figure 22 is \(A_{max}\) (\(a\)) and \(t_{p}\) (\(b\)), for all the samplings, as a function of \(\eta\) (for one \(\phi\) line) at room and cold temperatures. Expected module geometrical effects can be observed for example at \(\eta=1.5\) or \(2.5\). A correlation, linked to cell capacitance variations, is expected between \(A_{max}\) and \(t_{p}\). It can clearly be seen in the middle sampling.

To get a better understanding, TPA test results have been compared to beam test results obtained for the ECC1 module with ATLAS-like electronics with FEB and calibration boards. For example, Figure 23 represents normalized \(A_{max}\) from the TPA test as a function of normalized \(A_{max}\) from the FEBs, in the middle sampling. A good correlation is obtained at room and cold temperatures. The other samplings have a similar behavior.

Figure 24 is the normalized \(A_{max}\) and \(t_{p}\) relative difference distributions defined as:

\[\frac{\Delta A_{max}}{A_{max}}=\frac{A_{max}^{norm}\left(TPA\right)-A_{max}^{norm} \left(FEB\right)}{A_{max}^{norm}\left(TPA\right)}\ \ \mbox{and}\ \ \frac{\Delta t_{p}}{t_{p}}=\frac{t_{p}(TPA)-t_{p}(FEB)}{t_{p}(TPA)}\]

A good agreement is obtained for \(A_{max}\), where measurements differ by less than 2% in average. But these distributions are not absolute by construction therefore such a result is good but not surprising. Concerning \(t_{p}\), systematic differences, depending on the sampling, are observed between the two tests. No real explanation have been found, except that these effects may be linked to excessive sensitivity to reflexion as well as cable adaptation problems. S2 and S3 have the same cable impedance and their \(t_{p}\) distribution are very similar but shifted in an opposite way compared to the S1 distribution. Another possible explanation might be a shaping problem in the TPA analysis. Further investigations are underway to improve our understanding. But the ability of the TPA test to identify and cure problematic channels is not compromised. And more generally, there is a good agreement in the results of the two set-up that justify to use the more simple TPA test to qualify the modules.

## 5 Conclusions

In February 2001 started the production of the ATLAS electromagnetic endcap calorimeter modules. This note described all the electrical tests defined and built to qualify

produced modules before their wheel integration. These tests were tuned on the first modules. Results presented in this note were obtained with the first five produced modules. They show the performances and module to module stability of those tests. These results give us confidence in the quality of the qualified modules before their integration. In the future, during and after integration, some of these tests such as TPA or HV will be done again to confirm the expected performances and fully qualify each wheel before their cryostat insertion. After completion of the first wheel insertion, a global analysis of the module test results will be done and reported in a future note.

Electromagnetic Endcap calorimeter segmentation

The electromagnetic endcap calorimeter is segmented in \(\eta\) and \(\phi\) directions. Each cell is labelled by a couple of numbers \((\eta_{C},\phi_{C})\) that gives its location on the module. Figure 25 shows a schematic view of an outer and an inner wheel flat electrode. The cell number \((\eta_{C})\) is given for the three samplings.

The cells in \(\phi\)\((\phi_{C})\) are obtained by summing adjacent electrodes. The number of electrodes depends on the wheel and the sampling :

* in the outer wheel : S1 cells have a segmentation of \(0.1\) which corresponds to the sum of \(12\) electrodes \((\phi_{C}=0-7)\) whereas in the two other samplings the cells are obtained by summing \(3\) electrodes \((\phi_{C}=0-31)\).
* in the inner wheel, a \(\phi\) cell is the sum of \(4\) electrodes for the two samplings \((\phi_{C}=0-7)\). It corresponds to a segmentation of \(0.1\).
