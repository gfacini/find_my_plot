###### Abstract

In this note the feasibility of extracting a Higgs signal in the \(H^{0}\to Z^{0}Z^{*0}\to b\bar{b}e^{+}e^{-}(\mu^{+}\mu^{-})\) decay channel with the Atlas detector at the LHC is studied in great detail. It is shown that with 30 \(fb^{-1}\) it is possible to observe a 150 \(GeV\) Higgs boson with a significance of 2.7 \(\sigma\) with a total of 17 observed signal events on top of 60 expected background events.

Introduction

Motivated by indirect theoretical and experimental evidences for the existence of a light Higgs boson, with a mass below 160 GeV, it is our intention to extend the sensitivity for Higgs search with a channel not yet fully envisaged. In this mass range the Higgs boson has a probability of a few percents to decay to a pair of a virtual and an on shell Z\({}^{0}\) boson. If both of the Z\({}^{0}\) bosons decay to a pair of muons or electrons one gets a very clear signature which is considered to be the golden signature for the discovery of a light Higgs boson bib-TDR[1]. However, the branching fraction of a Z\({}^{0}\) boson to a pair of electrons or muons is about 3.3% while for a pair of down-type quarks it is about 15%. In order to take advantage of this relatively high decay probability, yet, to avoid saturation by light quarks QCD background (e.g. Z\({}^{0}qq\)) it is required that the on shell Z\({}^{0}\) boson decays to a pair of \(b\) quarks while the off shell Z\({}^{0*}\) decays to a pair of electrons or muons, H\({}^{0}\)\(\rightarrow\)Z\({}^{0}\)Z\({}^{0*}\)\(\rightarrow\)b\(\bar{\rm b}\)e\({}^{+}\)e\({}^{-}(\mu^{+}\mu^{-})\) (Figure 1).

The main background to this process are events that contain a pair of \(b\)-quarks like \(t\bar{t}\), Z\({}^{0}\)b\(\bar{\rm b}\) and \(b\bar{b}\). The \(b\bar{b}\) production cross section is ten orders

of magnitude more than the signal and required a special pre-selection procedure at the generation level. The Monte Carlo simulations of the various background sources and the signal are described in section 2.

Requiring that the most probable pair of \(b\)-tagged jets emerges from an on-shell \(\mathrm{Z^{0}}\) boson allows the improvement of the momentum-mass resolution by a constrained fit as described in section 3.

The Atlas detector equipped with the Si-b-layer and the pixel detectors allows to obtain good b-tag efficiency. A complete understanding of the \(b\) tag performance is possible only via full simulation. This analysis is based on the Atlas fast simulation. A description of the Atlfast \(b\) tag and its implications on this analysis is given in section 4.

The event topology here is clear. An event is flagged as a possible signal candidate if it has at least two b-tagged jets accompanied by two opposite sign isolated muons or electrons originating from the primary vertex with a low di-lepton mass compatible with a virtual \(\mathrm{Z^{0*}}\) boson. In a similar manner to \(b\)-tag, the isolation of leptons in presence of jets is best described by full simulation. The fast simulation isolation criteria is based solely on calorimetry. This criteria were improved by requiring that the candidate electrons be isolated also from the charged tracking point of view and emerge from the interaction point as described in section 5.

Finally, the analysis and the results are described in section 6.

## 2 Monte Carlo Simulations

The cross sections of the signal and background processes are given in Table 1. All signals and backgrounds were generated by Pythia [2] and processed through the Atlas fast simulation bib-atlfastprogram, Atlfast [3]. That includes also the \(\mathrm{Z^{0}b\bar{b}}\) process which was recently incorporated into Pythia3[5]. The Drell-Yan \(\mathrm{Z^{0}}/\gamma\) process has some obvious overlap with the \(\mathrm{Z^{0}b\bar{b}}\) background. In order to avoid it, events that pass the cuts in the \(\mathrm{Z^{0}}/\gamma\) back ground were not taken into account if their primary tree contained a \(\mathrm{b\bar{b}}\) pair. Namely, for \(\mathrm{e^{+}e^{-}b\bar{b}}\) (\(\mu^{+}\mu^{-}b\bar{b}\)) about 66% (50%) of the events surviving the cuts in Table 2 (Table 3) were originated in \(\mathrm{b\bar{b}}\) production and were removed from the sample.

Some Feynman diagrams of the dominant background processes are shown in Figure 2.

In order to reduce the Drell-Yan background (\(\mathrm{Z^{0}}/\gamma{\rightarrow}ll\) where \(l\) could be any lepton) to a manageable data sample, the center of mass energy of the hard process (i.e. the "photon" invariant mass) was required to be above 20 GeV (CKIN(1)=20). This pre-requirement does not affect the analysis because the dilepton mass is required to be above 25 GeV in the analysis stage. Similarly the di-lepton (photon) mass for the \(\mathrm{Z^{0}b\bar{b}}\) process was required to be above 10 GeV.

The \(\mathrm{b\bar{b}}\) background, as generated by Pythia (MSEL=5), is over 10 orders of magnitude bigger than the Higgs signal. A luminosity of \(~{}30~{}fb^{-1}\) yields \(\mathrm{O}(10^{13})\)\(\mathrm{b\bar{b}}\) events. It is of course impossible to generate such a huge number of events, not even with a fast simulation. A study was made in order to find ways to reduce the \(\mathrm{b\bar{b}}\) background, in its generation level, to a manageable background. It was found out that the \(\mathrm{b\bar{b}}\) background can be reduced by two orders of magnitude by limiting the Pythia \(2\to 2~{}p_{T}\) value (CKIN(3)) to be above \(20~{}\mathrm{GeV}\). This value is correlated with the \(p_{T}\) of the b-quarks and is completely satisfied by the analysis requirement that the two tagged \(b\) jets will have a transverse momentum above 30 GeV (see section 6)4. Another

\end{table}

2 orders of magnitude were obtained by noticing that at the end of the day about 95% of the lepton candidates were originating from \(\Lambda_{b}\) and b-mesons, such as \(B^{0},B^{0}_{S}\) and \(B^{+}\). Forcing the semi-leptonic decays of the b-hadrons (and correcting for the 5% loss) gains the additional 2 orders of magnitude. This way, 30 Million events is equivalent in generation to about 1 \(fb^{-1}\) of integrated luminosity. Our \(\rm b\bar{b}\) analysis is based on an equivalence of 10 \(fb^{-1}\) of luminosity for each of the final leptonic states.

## 3 The Constrained Fit

In order to improve the jets energy measurements a fit is done where the two tagged \(b\)-jets are constrained to emerge from an on shell \(\rm Z^{0}\). The secret of any fit is a correct evaluation the measured quantities subject to the fit and their errors. To get the best possible energy measurements the standard ATLFAST [3] energy calibration was applied to the jets before the fitting took place. Figure 3a shows the difference between the \(b\)-parton energy and its associated-jet energy. Note that the RMS of this distribution is 16%. We have tried different parametrizations of the error and found out that by assigning an error of 16% on the jet energy or alternatively using the

Figure 2: Some Feynman diagrams of the dominant background processes.

following parametrization \(\Delta E/E=0.5/\sqrt{E}+0.1\)5 the best \(\chi^{2}\) probability is obtained (flat). The corresponding \(\chi^{2}\) probability is shown in Figure 3b. The probability has an excess near zero due to imperfection in the description of the resolution function. Both plots are shown with a cut of 1% on the \(prob(\chi^{2})\). Figure 4 shows the fitted and non-fitted reconstructed Higgs mass for a \(\chi^{2}\) probabilities below (a) and above (b) 5%. It clearly shows that the fit allows to get a resolution of 3 GeV for a 150 GeV Higgs mass.

Footnote 5: This parametrization was inspired by the TDR jet reconstruction [4]

The low mass events with small \(\chi^{2}\) probability are probably events where the two \(b\)-tagged jets did not emerge from the on-shell Z\({}^{0}\) and one of them emitted an energetic gluon which got lost. Preliminary attempts to recover those lost gluon jets by associated a non \(b\)-tagged jet to the closest tagged \(b\)-jet show that it is possible to increase the signal efficiency by a few percents and improve a bit the signal to background significance [6]. These studies are still non conclusive and the improvement is marginal. They were therefore not implemented in this note.

## 4 Implications of the fast \(b\) tag

The fast simulation is assigning jets6 originating in b-partons, a b-tag efficiency and impurity in a randomised way. The tag is therefore made in two stages. In the first stage one is looking for a \(b\)-parton with \(|\eta|<2.5\) and a transverse momentum exceeding 5 GeV. About 81% of the \(b\)-partons satisfy these conditions but only in about 63% of them one finds a jet with \(E_{th}=10\) GeV in a cone of \(\Delta R=0.2\) around the tree-identified b-parton where \(\Delta R=\sqrt{\Delta\eta^{2}+\Delta\Phi^{2}}\). If such a jet is found it is marked as a b-jet. The probability of a \(b\)-parton to be marked as a \(b\)-jet is therefore around 51%. If on top of this association efficiency one assigns a tag efficiency of 70% (Using ATLFBJE with option 3 [3]), the resulting \(b\)-tag probability of a \(b\)-jet is about 36 %, and that for a double \(b\)-tag around 13% (excluding impurities).

Footnote 6: A jet is defined as a cluster which is not an isolated electron or photon. A close-by non isolated muon is added to the cluster and the minimum energy of the jet is required to be more than \(E_{th}\). The threshold energies used for this study were 10 and 15 GeV. While for the \(b\)-tag studies presented here we used \(E_{th}=10\) GeV, we ended up using \(E_{th}=15\) GeV which turned out to have a better rejection power against Z\({}^{0}/\gamma\) background.

To understand why so many \(b\)-jets are lost already at the association stage a jet quantity \(b-ness\) was defined as the fraction of particles originating in a Figure 3: The jet-energy error as measured with respect to its associated \(b\)-parton (a) and the resulting \(\chi^{2}\) probability of the fit.

\(B\) hadron in the jet. Figure 5a shows the \(b\)-ness of \(b\)-tagged jets. The \(b\)-ness of the other jets is shown in Figure 5b, and the portion of the plot with positive \(b\)-ness is shown in Figure 5c. It is clear that those jets with \(b-ness>0.6\) are bound to be lost. To check this, the pseudo-rapidity distribution (\(\eta\)) of those jets is shown in Figure 6a. Jets with \(|\eta|>2.5\) are naturally lost, however there is still a large fraction of the jets in the central region of the detector that are not marked as \(b\) jets. The distance \(\Delta R\) of these jets from the closest \(b\) parton is shown in Figure 6b where it is clear that those jets are lost due to the association cone chosen at a default of \(\Delta R=0.2\). Jets with \(\Delta R>0.2\) tend to originate from lower transverse momenta partons. This is clearly seen in Figure 7 where a contour plot of the \(b\)-partons \(p_{T}\) vs the distance \(\Delta R\) is shown. While choosing a bigger association cone will increase the association efficiency it will also increase the background level. At this stage it was clear that only a proper full simulation \(b\)-tag study, dedicated to this analysis, can give further answers on how to improve the \(b\)-tag.

One should note that using this randomising procedure to tag b-jets is not taking into account the correlation between the b-lifetime and the event tracking properties, which will allow in real-life a better background rejection power, especially for leptons coming from b-jets. We therefore think that the rejection of the problematic b\(\bar{\rm b}\) background and other related backgrounds

(like \(\rm Z^{0}b\bar{b}\) and \(t\bar{t}\)) will be better. In that sense this analysis turns out to be conservative.

## 5 Removing the \(\rm b\bar{b}\) Background

The Higgs signal is characterised by two high energetic **isolated** leptons (electrons or muons) coming from a \(\rm Z^{0}\) decay and therefore originating in the primary vertex. Leptons originated in the \(\rm b\bar{b}\) background are either not isolated or do not come from the primary vertex and therefore should be rejected by applying isolation and impact parameter requirements on electrons and muons. Figure 8 shows the missing distance in the transverse plane. Not like the impact parameter, the missing distance is hardly sensitive to the location of the beam spot. Motivated by its distribution, the missing distance was required to satisfy \(\Delta d_{0}<200\) (50 )\(\mu\) for electrons (muons). A stringent requirement for electrons would cost a significant loss of signal. The standard Atlfast [3] calorimetry based isolation7 is therefore supplemented by requiring that for electrons, no charged tracks with transverse momentum larger than 1.5 GeV are allowed in a cone of \(\Delta R=0.2\) around the electron candidate.

Footnote 7: It was required that there will be no clusters within a cone of \(\Delta R=0.40\) around the lepton and that the total energy deposited in cells within this cone will not exceed 10 GeV.

The rejection of the huge \(\rm b\bar{b}\) background is shown in Tables 2 and 3. The first column shows the cuts-flow without any vertex and supplementary

isolation requirements while the second (and third for electrons) columns show the effect of vertex (and charged-track isolation) requirements.

It is to be noted that both vertex based b-tag and isolation criteria should be further studies via full simulation to take into account inefficiencies of tracks reconstruction, faked tracks etc.

## 6 Analysis

All signals and generated backgrounds are first subject to fiducial pre-cuts. Events are required to have two b-tagged jets and 2 oppositely signed isolated leptons with a dilepton mass satisfying \(10<m_{ll}<70~{}\mathrm{GeV}\). The constrained fit is required to converge with the fit probability greater than 1%. If there

\begin{tabular}{|c||c|c|} \hline Cut & & + Missing Distance \\ \hline \hline \(Prob(\chi^{2})>0.01\) & 478 & 60 \\ \hline Trigger & 475 & 59 \\ \hline \(m_{ll}>25~{}\mathrm{GeV}\) & 99 & 7 \\ \hline \(p_{T}<25~{}\mathrm{GeV}\) & 96 & 7 \\ \hline \(55<m_{\mathrm{b\bar{b}}}<85~{}\mathrm{GeV}\) & 60 & 3 \\ \hline \(p_{T}^{jet}>30~{}\mathrm{GeV}\) & 24 & 0 \\ \hline \end{tabular}

Figure 8: The missing distance in the transverse plane, \(\Delta d_{0}\)

are more than two b-tagged jets, the pair with the highest fit probability is chosen. As for lepton pairs, the one where both oppositely charged leptons have the highest transverse momentum is chosen.

Events were then required to trigger the detector. This occurs mainly by requiring two low \(p_{T}\) leptons (6 GeV for muons, 15 GeV for electrons) or one high \(p_{T}\) lepton (20 GeV for muons, 25 GeV for electrons). No additional requirements on leptons momenta were imposed.

However, to further improve the rejection of leptons coming from heavy quarks and falsely identified as isolated, it was required that the candidate leptons will originate from the primary vertex. The missing distance was required to satisfy \(\Delta d_{0}<200\) (50 )\(\mu\) for electrons (muons) (see section 5).

The dilepton mass is required to be bigger than 25 GeV. This reduces background sources like \(\rm{Z^{0}b\bar{b}}\) and \(\rm{Z^{0}}/\gamma\) where the dileptons originate mainly from the accompanied photon (Figure 9).

\(\rm{t\bar{t}}\) events contain many neutrinos and therefore their missing transverse momentum is high. To reduce this background the total \(p_{T}\) of the event was required to be below 25 GeV (Figure 10).

The ATLFAST jets calibration is pushing the jets energy higher so that the signal \(\rm{b\bar{b}}\) mass tends to be around the \(\rm{Z^{0}}\) mass. The constrained fit is refitting the energies of the calibrated jets. As a result the fit probability cut is highly correlated with the requirement that the \(\rm{b\bar{b}}\) mass will be around the \(\rm{Z^{0}}\) mass. However, a further rejection of the background is achieved by requiring that the \(\rm{b\bar{b}}\) mass calculated with the _uncalibrated_ momenta satisfies \(55<m_{\rm{b\bar{b}}}<85\) GeV as can be seen in Figure 11.

The \(b\)-jets originating from a genuine on-shell \(\rm{Z^{0}}\) tend to have high trans

verse momenta. This is to a lesser degree the case for the \(\rm Z^{0}b\bar{b}\) and \(\rm t\bar{t}\) backgrounds as can be seen in Figure 12. After optimization we arrive at the requirement that the fitted transverse momentum of the jets be above 30 \(\rm GeV\). It was observed that the _fitted_ transverse momenta are discriminating better the signal from the background.

The cuts flow for signal and background for di-electrons and di-muons final states are shown in tables 4 and 5. Note that the number of events is given within a window of \(\pm 1\sigma\) of the signal expectation.

The resulting significance for various Higgs masses with an integrated luminosity of 30 fb\({}^{-1}\) are given in table 6.

## 7 Conclusion

In this note a simple analysis was developed to prove the feasibility of extracting a Higgs signal in the \(\rm H^{0}\)\(\rightarrow\)\(\rm Z^{0}\)\(\rm Z^{0*}\)\(\rightarrow\)\(\rm b\bar{b}\)\(\rm e^{+}\)\(\rm e^{-}(\mu^{+}\mu^{-})\) decay channel with the Atlas detector at the LHC. With as low as 30 fb\({}^{-1}\) it was shown that it is possible to observe a 150 GeV Higgs boson with a significance of 2.7 \(\sigma\) with a total of 17 observed signal events on top of 60 expected background

One should note that this analysis was optimized for a low luminosity of 30 fb\({}^{-1}\). It was optimized and simplified such that the acceptance will be higher even at the cost of some reduced significance.
