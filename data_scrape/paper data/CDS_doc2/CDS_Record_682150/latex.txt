Several types of \(\;\mbox{\bf\vec{t}}\;\) events have been generated using PYTHIA in order to study the systematics in the top mass measurement using the dilepton mass method.

## I Introduction

It is known that the multilepton channels (two or more leptons) can be used, even at high luminosity, to extract a clean signal for it events, especially in the isolated electron and muon channel.

The dilepton mass (with one isolated lepton from a \(W\) and a muon from a \(b\) decay) will be used in order to determine the top mass m\({}_{\rm top}\)[1, 2].

We worked mainly with the 4 lepton tapes that have been already used in Higgs background study [3]. In some cases additionnal events have been generated.

Using PYTHIA [4] 17 samples of Monte-Carlo \(\rm\overline{t}\) events have been generated varying some parameters related to the top decay and \(b\) fragmentation, and with the following top masses : 120, 140, 160 and 200 GeV. In all the cases, the W and \(b\) leptonic decays have been set on.

The samples are described in Appendix 1.

Several parameters can be varied :

\(\rightarrow\)the value of \(\rm\epsilon_{b}\) of the non perturbative Peterson et al. fragmentation function [5] ; \(\rm\epsilon_{b}\) extracted from LEP is around 0.006 with a typical error of 0.002.

\(\rightarrow\)the amount of gluon radiation ; this can be varied in particular with \(\rm\alpha_{s}\).

\(\rightarrow\)t quark or T hadron : both are produced non polarized in PYTHIA ( the top polarizaton is not yet introduced in PYTHIA ) and decay isotropically in a \(b\) and a \(W\). In the case of a t quark, (in PYTHIA) the \(W\) is non polarized and then decays isotropically. In the case of the T hadron there are two possibilities:

\(\underline{\ }\)the same as for the t quark : the \(W\) is produced non polarized.

\(\underline{\ }\)the \(W\) is produced polarized and then decays non isotropically.

We recall that, for large top masses, the longitudinal polarization of the \(W\) (h\({}_{w}\) = 0) is preferred to the transverse polarization (h\({}_{w}\) = \(\pm\)1) [6].

All kinematical variables depend, more or less, on the top mass and can be used to determine this mass. However, these kinematical variables depend also on the transverse momentum of the top (p\({}_{\rm T}^{\rm top}\)), which has uncertainties (from higher order effects).

Therefore, to measure the top mass, we have to find a kinematical variable which is sensitive to the top mass and not to the transverse top momentum, in order to have the smallest systematic error from the uncertainties on \(\rm p_{T}^{top}\).

The best variables to measure the top mass are Lorentz invariants for which the dependence on \(\rm p_{T}^{top}\) can only arise from an effect of the cuts used to define the sample.

**II. CUTS AND STATISTICAL ERRORS**

_1. Cuts_

The \(l\,l\,\mu\) events which are selected fulfil the following cuts:

\(\rightarrow\)for the leptons \(l\) =e,\(\mu\) coming from the \(W\) we ask for \(\rm p_{T}^{e,\mu}\) > \(\rm p_{T}^{(1)}\)

\(\rightarrow\)for the lepton \(\mu\) coming from the \(b\) we ask for \(\rm p_{T}^{\mu}\) > \(\rm p_{T}^{(2)}\)

We ask also the pseudo-rapidity of the leptons \(|\eta|\) to be smaller than \(\eta^{max}\).

The standard set of cuts will be :

\(\rm p_{T}^{(1)}\)=20 GeV

\(\rm p_{T}^{(2)}\)= 7 GeV

\(\rm\eta^{max}\)=2.5

For a top mass of 140 GeV, ( with a cross section \(\rm\sigma^{\rm\overline{\rm e}\to}3\) nb = 3000 pb ) the number of events generated with 3 leptons is N = 282000, corresponding to a luminosity \(L\) = 0.94 10\({}^{4}\) pb\({}^{-1}\), the branching rate being \(\rm B_{l\,l\,\mu}\) = 10\({}^{-2}\).

So we used the dilepton mass in order to estimate the top mass :We have calculated the invariant mass \(m_{\mu~{}\mu}\) between the lepton \(l\) coming from the \(W\) and the muon \(\mu\) coming from the \(b\).

Fig.1 shows the values, with their error bars, of the average value of this invariant mass versus the top mass, for different sets of cuts and for the standard t production.

Fig.2 gives the \(m_{l~{}\mu}\) distribution for 3 top masses.

In order to see the effect of the transverse momentum of the top on the invariant mass, we have plotted \(m_{l~{}\mu}\) versus \(p_{\rm T}^{\rm top}\) in fig.3, for 2 different sets of cuts.

Fig. 3 shows clearly that the uncertainty on \(p_{\rm T}^{\rm top}\) has a very small influence on \(m_{l~{}\mu}\). In particular a change of \(p_{\rm T}^{\rm top}\) by 10 GeV corresponds to a change of \(m_{\rm top}\) by \(\leq\) 1 GeV. It has to be stressed that the \(l~{}\mu\) mass corresponds to the invariant mass between two leptons coming from the same top ( or anti-top ) quark. _In this note we do not touch the problem of background ( internal or external )_.

Fig.4 shows the distribution of \(p_{\rm T}^{\rm top}\) for different sets of cuts : it is clear that for high \(p_{\rm T}^{\rm(1)}\) and \(p_{\rm T}^{\rm(2)}\) cuts there are almost no events at small \(p_{\rm T}^{\rm top}\).

_2. Statistical errors_

The statistical errors expected for \(m_{\rm top}\)=140 GeV, with a global lepton efficiency \(\varepsilon\)=0.5 and a luminosity \(L\) = 0.94 10\({}^{4}\) pb\({}^{-1}\) are estimated below for different sets of cuts :

\[\begin{array}{ccccc}20&7&2.5&\sigma(\overline{m}_{\mu~{}\mu})\mbox{=0.08 GeV}&\sigma(m_{\rm top})\mbox{=0.24 GeV}\\ \\ 20&7&1.5&\sigma(\overline{m}_{\mu~{}\mu})\mbox{=0.13 GeV}&\sigma(m_{\rm top}) \mbox{=0.37 GeV}\\ \\ 20&12&2.5&\sigma(\overline{m}_{\mu~{}\mu})\mbox{=0.11 GeV}&\sigma(m_{\rm top}) \mbox{=0.28 GeV}\\ \\ 20&15&2.5&\sigma(\overline{m}_{\mu~{}\mu})\mbox{=0.14 GeV}&\sigma(m_{\rm top}) \mbox{=0.34 GeV}\\ \\ 40&20&2.5&\sigma(\overline{m}_{\mu~{}\mu})\mbox{=0.27 GeV}&\sigma(m_{\rm top}) \mbox{=0.54 GeV}\\ \\ 50&25&1.5&\sigma(\overline{m}_{\mu~{}\mu})\mbox{=0.51 GeV}&\sigma(m_{\rm top}) \mbox{=0.89 GeV}\\ \end{array}\]

The last value can be compared to what was found in [2]. A statistical error of about 2.8 GeV was found for \(m_{\rm top}\) = 130 GeV. Neglecting the difference of \(m_{\rm top}\) and taking into account that 4 times more events are used now (in [2] only events,with the two muons coming from the same top, were considered) we would have expected to find an error of : \(\frac{2.8}{\sqrt{0.94*\sqrt{4}}}\) = 1.44 GeV.

The value found now (= 0.89 GeV) is smaller because the value in [2] was, we think,computed using ( incorrectly ) the r.m.s of a distribution ( fig. 18, page 384 in [2] ) which includes the internal background.

(v) Sample 9 gives a mass about 4 GeV larger. But we know that the Lund fragmentation gives a larger z to the \(B\) meson ( \(\Delta\)z = 0.07 ). By the naive formula \(\frac{\Delta\mbox{m}_{\rm top}}{\mbox{m}_{\rm top}}=\frac{1}{2}\frac{\Delta \mbox{z}}{\mbox{z}}\) we would have expected \(\Delta\mbox{m}_{\rm top}\) = 7 GeV.

(vi) In sample 7 gluon radiation has been switched off. The top mass increases by a lot ( = 7 GeV ). As expected the mass is going back to the standard value for \(\varepsilon_{\rm b}\) = 0.055 and no gluon radiation ( Sample 8 ).

(vii) Sample 14 is obtained by decreasing \(\alpha_{\rm s}\) through \(\Lambda_{\rm QCD}\) which is set to 0.1 instead of 0.3. The change of z is \(\Delta\)z = 0.03 and the change in m\({}_{\rm top}\) is about 1.5 to 2 GeV. This difference cannot be taken as an estimate of the systematic error because the change in \(\Delta\)z is about two times larger than the LEP measurement error. If we had had a change of \(\Lambda_{\rm QCD}\) corresponding to \(\Delta\)z = 0.013 we would have obtained a change \(\Delta\mbox{m}_{\rm top}\)\(\leq\) 1 GeV, similar to (iv). The small difference between samples 13 and 5 comes from the fact that in sample 13 ( and 14 ) PARU(112) was (by mistake) not changed [9].

It is difficult to estimate the systematic error. The part due to the experimental uncertainty on \(b\) fragmentation from LEP is small : less than or about 1 GeV ( see (iv) and (vii) ). The other part is the theoretical uncertainty in going from LEP to a hadron collider. We would need more insight from theorists but _maybe we can say that it is less than or about 2 GeV_, because this 2 GeV corresponds ( see (iii) ) to a change between two schemes ( t quark and T hadron ) which are rather different. Also we can notice that 2 GeV is 30% of the effect obtained by switching off completely the gluon radiation ( a dramatic change ). It is clear that at this level of precision t polarization has to be included (presumably with higher order - \(\alpha_{\rm s}^{3}\) - \(\tilde{\rm t}\) production). Under pressure theorists [9] almost guarantee a less than or about 2 GeV systematic uncertainty on m\({}_{\rm top}\) from computations done at the start of LHC.

Appendix 1 Various samples have been generated. The GENZ tapes filtered (at Lyon) are given. The generations use the HMRSB (August '90) structure function set, taken from [8] using MSTP(52)=2, MSTP(51)=36.
