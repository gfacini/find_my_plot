The Higgs sector in the MSSM is expected to be explored with ATLAS at the LHC in various decay channels, if supersymmetry exists. Two parameters of the MSSM sector, \(m_{\rm A}\) and \(\tan\beta\), could then possibly be measured. The masses of the Higgs bosons can be easily extracted from the position of the reconstructed mass peak. The parameter \(\tan\beta\), on the other hand, can be determined in some of these analyses via the measurement of the related production rates. The precision which can be accomplished in these measurements is the objective of this note.

Introduction

One of the main goals of the operation of ATLAS at the LHC is the search for supersymmetric particles and, if found, the determination of their masses, couplings and other properties of the model. The discovery of Higgs bosons and the measurement of their masses, especially, will provide a handle to constrain the parameters of the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) substantially.

The Higgs sector of the MSSM contains two charged and three neutral physical states. Since the MSSM provides a large variety of decay modes for the Higgs bosons --many of them being observable by the LHC--, their mass can be measured through the peak position of the reconstructed effective mass. This holds for the light neutral, \(\mathrm{h}^{0}\), the pseudoscalar, \(\mathrm{A}^{0}\), and the heavy neutral, \(\mathrm{H}^{0}\), Higgs bosons. The mass of the charged Higgs bosons, \(\mathrm{H}^{\pm}\), would be much more difficult to be determined, since in the most promising channel for this particle, \(\mathrm{H}^{\pm}\)\(\rightarrow\)\(\tau\nu_{\tau}\), only an excess of events is expected to be observed [1, 2].

Another issue discussed in this note is the precision measurement of the ratio of the vacuum expectation values of the two Higgs doublets, \(\tan\beta\). Since the production rates of the Higgs bosons decay modes depend mainly on this parameter as well as in the pseudoscalar Higgs mass, by measuring the rate and \(m_{\mathrm{A}}\), it is feasible to determine the parameter \(\tan\beta\). This is attainable by exploiting channels produced in high rates at the LHC, such as \(\mathrm{H}/\mathrm{A}\rightarrow\tau\tau\), \(\mathrm{H}/\mathrm{A}\rightarrow\mu\mu\) and \(\mathrm{H}\rightarrow\mathrm{ZZ}^{(*)}\to 4\ell\).

This note is organized as follows: The decay channels and some aspects of their analyses are reviewed in Section 2. In Section 3 the calculation of the uncertainty in the measurement of the mass is described and the corresponding results are presented. The procedure applied for the \(\tan\beta\)-precision measurement and its results are discussed in Section 4. The results and conclusions are summarized in Section 5.

## 2 Decay channels

In the analyses presented here, two-loop calculations have been used for the masses and couplings, as well as one-loop calculations for some decay branching ratios (\(\mathrm{H}\)\(\rightarrow\)hh). All supersymmetric particles are assumed to be heavy enough so that they do not affect the phenomenology of the MSSM Higgs bosons decays. More details on the assumptions made for the physics processes and the event generation of the signal and background can be found in the related references [1, 3, 4]. The top-quark mass, to which there is a significant sensitivity of the radiative corrections in the MSSM Higgs sector, is set to 175 GeV. The results in most cases correspond to an integrated luminosity of 300 fb\({}^{-1}\). The channels considered for the measurements of masses and \(\tan\beta\) are listed in Table 1. In the channels listed in the last column, H- and A-bosons cannot be distinguished, since they are degenerated in mass.

The discovery of the Higgs bosons in the MSSM has been studied in detail in ATLAS. Most of the analyses used for the precision measurements are documented in Ref. [1]. The lightest Higgs boson, \(\rm h^{0}\), can be discovered over almost the whole (\(m_{\rm A},\,\tan\beta\)) plane considered, via the SM mode \(\rm h\to\gamma\gamma\), where the \(\rm h\)-boson is produced either directly, or in association with a \(\rm W\) or a \(\rm t\bar{t}\) pair, as well as through the \(\rm Wh\) with \(\rm h\to b\overline{b}\). The discovery potential for the latter channel is not considered at the high luminosity, as the tight jet veto necessary to suppress \(\rm t\bar{t}\) background is not that efficient in this case. Therefore, the results used in this analysis are expected to be obtained during the period of the LHC running at low luminosity (\(\int\!L{\rm d}t=30\) fb\({}^{-1}\)).

The H-boson, on the other hand, can be observed in the inclusive \(\rm H\to\gamma\gamma\) channel, in the \(\rm H\to ZZ^{(*)}\to 4\ell\) mode (although this mode is suppressed with respect to the Standard Model) and via its decay to two \(\rm h\)-bosons, \(\rm H\to hh\to b\overline{b}\gamma\gamma\). The channel \(\rm H\to\gamma\gamma\), in particular, is only visible for \(60<m_{\rm A}<80\) GeV corresponding to \(m_{\rm H}\)=110-120 GeV, which is a range already excluded by the recent LEP2 results [5].

The CP-odd boson, \(\rm A^{0}\), finally, is expected to be visible in the inclusive \(\rm A\to\gamma\gamma\) mode and the \(\rm A\to Zh\to\ell\ell b\overline{b}\) channel. It can also be observed in modes where the H- and the A-bosons are degenerated in mass and give the same signature, such as \(\rm H/A\to\mu\mu\) and \(\rm H/A\to t\bar{t}\).

For the SM decay modes the results obtained from the analysis for a SM Higgs have been extrapolated to the (\(m_{\rm A}\), \(\tan\beta\)) plane after being rescaled to the MSSM cross sections and branching ratios. These results have been obtained in most cases with the full simulation of the ATLAS detector.

The \(\rm t\bar{t}h\) with \(\rm h\to b\overline{b}\) decay mode was studied in Ref. [4]. A full coverage

of the \((m_{\rm A},\,\tan\beta)\) plane can be obtained with this channel after requiring four b-tagged jets and a full reconstruction of the final state.

The H/A \(\to\tau\tau\) channel, already studied in Ref. [6], has been revisited recently [3]. Two analyses have been combined, each of them optimised either for the direct H\({}^{0}\)/A\({}^{0}\) production (dominating at low \(\tan\beta\)), or the associated b\(\bar{\rm b}\)H\({}^{0}\)/A\({}^{0}\) one (which dominates at high \(\tan\beta\)). The same strategy has also been applied for the H/A \(\to\mu\mu\) channel [7].

The cross sections and branching ratios, as well as the expected numbers of signal and background events for 30 and 100 fb\({}^{-1}\) became the input to the software package1 used also in the Ref. [1] for extracting the discovery curves in the \((m_{\rm A},\,\tan\beta)\) plane. This information was used to automatically calculate the error \(\Delta m\) over the examined part of the \((m_{\rm A},\,\tan\beta)\) plane.

## 3 Measurement of the Higgs bosons masses

The error for each mass measurement consists of two parts; the statistical and the systematic error. In the statistical error both the uncertainty on the position of the mass peak and the error on the background subtraction are taken into account [8]. The exact formula [9] used is the following2

Footnote 2: \(\Delta m\) and \(\Delta\tan\beta\), denote the \(1\sigma\) errors on the quantities \(m\) and \(\tan\beta\), respectively; that is the \(1\sigma\) limits are, e.g., \(m\pm\Delta m\).

\[\frac{\Delta m}{m}=\frac{1}{m}\sqrt{\left(\frac{\sigma_{m}}{\sqrt{2N_{S}}} \right)^{2}+\left(\frac{\sqrt{N_{B}}n\sigma_{m}}{\sqrt{3}N_{S}}\right)^{2}+( \varepsilon_{\rm sys}m)^{2}}, \tag{1}\]

where

\[\sigma_{m}=\sqrt{\left(\frac{\Gamma}{2.36}\right)^{2}+\sigma_{resol}^{2}}, \tag{2}\]

\(m\) and \(\Delta m\) is the Higgs mass and its error; \(N_{S}\), \(N_{B}\) is the number of signal and background events, respectively; \(n\) defines the mass window \([m-n\sigma_{m},\,m+n\sigma_{m}]\); \(\varepsilon_{\rm sys}\) is the relative systematic error; \(\Gamma\) is the natural width of Higgs for this decay; and \(\sigma_{resol}\) is the mass uncertainty due to detector effects.

The derivation of the first term (error from the signal events) is explained in Appendix A. The quantity \(c(n)\), defined in Appendix A as a correction factor for the finite range of the truncated (in the mass window) Gaussian distribution, is taken to be equal to 0.5. This value corresponds to a mass window with \(n\) between one and two, which is consistent with the values used during the analyses of the various channels.

As far as the systematics is concerned, the relative error on the energy scale is assumed to be equal to 0.1% for decays involving photons and leptons, and 1% for decays to jets and taus [11]. The systematic error related to the \(E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}\) measurement is not taken into account.

Under the previous assumptions, the precision on the measurement of the Higgs mass was calculated over the discovery region for each channel. The corresponding contours in the (\(m_{\rm A}\), \(\tan\beta\)) plane are shown in Fig. 1 for the h-boson, Fig. 2 for the H-boson and Fig. 3 for the A-boson.

Figure 1: Expected fractional errors on the measured \(\rm h^{0}\)-boson mass over the (\(m_{\rm A}\), \(\tan\beta\)) plane for an integrated luminosity of 300 \(\rm fb^{-1}\). The decay modes encountered are: (a) inclusive \(\rm h\to\gamma\gamma\), (b) Wh, \(\rm t\bar{t}h\) with \(\rm h\to\gamma\gamma\), (c) Wh with \(\rm h\to b\bar{b}\) (for 30 \(\rm fb^{-1}\)), and (d) \(\rm t\bar{t}h\) with \(\rm h\to b\bar{b}\). The thick curves define the discovery region of each channel.

If the h-boson is discovered through the Standard Model production processes (direct or associated production), the precision of the mass measurement is similar to that expected for the SM Higgs boson [11]. Over the range of parameter space covered by both the \(\mathrm{h}\to\mathrm{b\overline{b}}\) and \(\mathrm{h}\to\gamma\gamma\) channels, the precision is determined by the \(\mathrm{h}\to\gamma\gamma\) channel and is \(\sim 0.1\%\). Over the region where only \(\mathrm{h}\to\mathrm{b\overline{b}}\) is observable, the expected precision is 1-3%.

Cascade decays of SUSY particles, discussed in Ref. [12], might provide an additional source of copious production of \(\mathrm{h}\to\mathrm{b\overline{b}}\) events. The precision which can be achieved in this channel varies with the rates associated with a given point in the supergravity parameter space. This channel is limited by the systematic error of 1% in the jet energy scale for signal rates above a few hundred events, which would be achieved over a large region of the supergravity parameter space, for an integrated luminosity of 30 \(\mathrm{fb}^{-1}\).

For low values of \(\tan\beta\), the precision of the measurement of the mass of the H-boson will be determined by the \(\mathrm{H}\to\mathrm{ZZ}^{(*)}\to 4\ell\) channel, if observable. It will vary strongly with \(\tan\beta\), from 0.1% to 0.3% following the rapid variation of rate. It will be worse than that expected for the SM Higgs boson of the same mass, since the MSSM rates are strongly suppressed. If only the \(\mathrm{H}\to\mathrm{hh}\to\mathrm{b\overline{b}}\gamma\gamma\) channel were to be accessible, the expected precision would not be better than \(\sim\)1%.

The pseudoscalar \(\mathrm{A}^{0}\) can be discovered for low values of \(\tan\beta\) in the \(\mathrm{A}\to\mathrm{Zh}\to\ell\ell\mathrm{b\overline{b}}\) and \(\mathrm{A}\to\gamma\gamma\) modes with rates varying very rapidly with \(\tan\beta\). The expected precision of the mass measurement is not better than 1-2% for \(\mathrm{A}\to\mathrm{Zh}\to\ell\ell\mathrm{b\overline{b}}\) and 0.1% for the \(\mathrm{A}\to\gamma\gamma\) channel.

In the case of \(\mathrm{H}/\mathrm{A}\to\tau\tau\), \(\mathrm{H}/\mathrm{A}\to\mu\mu\) and \(\mathrm{H}/\mathrm{A}\to\mathrm{t\overline{t}}\) modes, the discovery of both Higgs bosons was studied inclusively, since in the discovery regions:

* for both particles these decay modes are open and provide similar signatures; and
* H- and A-masses are almost equal. The criterion for mass degeneracy, as explained in Appendix B.1, is \[|m_{\mathrm{H}}-m_{\mathrm{A}}|<2\sigma_{m}.\] (3) This condition is met in the whole discovery region, as shown in Figures 4 and 5, thus allowing one to treat both Higgs bosons as one resonant state. Nevertheless, the discrimination may be possible, in principle, even for a mass difference lower than \(2\sigma_{m}\), by fitting the signal with the superposition of two Gaussians and exploiting the fact that the expected resolution is known from Monte Carlo studies. A related study has been performed and is described in Appendix B.2.

For these channels, where H\({}^{0}\) and A\({}^{0}\) cannot be discriminated, a more complicated approach is used for the determination of \(\Delta m\). The observed distribution of the di-particle mass is considered to be a superposition of three other probability density functions: the two Gaussians from H\({}^{0}\) and A\({}^{0}\) decays, plus a uniform distribution for the background. The derivation of the mean and the variance of this distribution is described in Appendix B.3. The difference of the measured mass, estimated by fitting the observed distribution, from the actual Higgs mass, \(m_{\rm H}\) or \(m_{\rm A}\), is also taken into account.

Hence, the error is calculated by adding quadratically three terms: the difference between the mean value of the final distribution and the actual Higgsmass, the statistical error on the determination of the mean value, and the systematic error.

\[\frac{\Delta m}{m}=\frac{1}{m}\sqrt{(\langle m\rangle-m_{\rm Higgs})^{2}+(\delta \langle m\rangle)^{2}+(\varepsilon_{\rm sys}m)^{2}}, \tag{4}\]

where \(m_{\rm Higgs}=m_{\rm H}\) or \(m_{\rm A}\), \(\langle m\rangle\) is the weighted mean value of the mass, and \((\delta\langle m\rangle)^{2}\) is the corresponding variance of the mean value (see Appendix B.3). The systematic error and the mass discrepancy are the dominant terms. In the whole discovery region, the latter proved to be almost the same for the two bosons, therefore the accuracy shown in Fig. 6 corresponds to both of them.

For large values of \(\tan\beta\), the heavy Higgs bosons can be discovered in the \(\tau\tau\) and \(\mu\mu\) decay mode. If both \({\rm H/A}\rightarrow\tau\tau\) and \({\rm H/A}\rightarrow\mu\mu\) decays are observable, the precision is determined by the \(\mu\mu\) decay mode, which has a much better expected resolution and a smaller systematic error. For high values of \(\tan\beta\), where both channels are accessible, the precision is about 0.1%. For moderate values of \(\tan\beta\), where the discovery reach of the \(\tau\tau\) channel extends further than that of the \(\mu\mu\) channel, the precision is degraded to 1-7%. For low values of \(\tan\beta\) (1-2) and for \(m_{\rm A}>350\) GeV, the \({\rm H/A}\rightarrow{\rm t\bar{t}}\) channel can provide a limited accuracy of \(\sim\!2\%\) on the determination of \(m_{\rm H}\) and \(m_{\rm A}\).

The precision obtained when all the discovery channels are combined is shown in Fig. 7. The combined error is given by the formula

\[\frac{1}{\Delta m^{2}_{\rm comb}}=\sum_{i}\frac{1}{\Delta m^{2}_{i}}. \tag{5}\]

The variation of the combined precision with \(m_{\rm A}\) for various discovery channels is indicated in Fig. 8, for \(\tan\beta\)=1.5, 3, 10 and 30.

The results for \({\rm H/A}\rightarrow\tau\tau\), \({\rm H/A}\rightarrow\mu\mu\) and \({\rm H}\rightarrow{\rm ZZ^{(*)}}\rightarrow{4\ell}\) are further used for the determination of the parameter \(\tan\beta\).

The decay modes encountered are: (a) H/A \(\rightarrow\tau\tau\), (b) H/A \(\rightarrow\mu\mu\), and (c) H/A \(\rightarrow\) t\(\bar{\rm t}\).

The thick curves define the discovery region of all channels.

The channels with the best precision are also indicated.

Determination of \(\tan\beta\)

The determination of the parameter \(\tan\beta\) is possible via the measurement of the production rates for some processes. This is feasible for channels such as H/A \(\rightarrow\tau\tau\), H/A \(\rightarrow\mu\mu\), for high \(\tan\beta\), and H \(\rightarrow\) ZZ\({}^{(*)}\)\(\rightarrow\) 4\(\ell\), for low \(\tan\beta\). As proposed in Ref. [9], the rates for these modes are sensitive to the value of \(\tan\beta\).

The error on the rate determination [9] is given by

\[\frac{\Delta\sigma^{\prime}}{\sigma^{\prime}}=\sqrt{\frac{S+B}{S^{2}}+\epsilon _{\rm sys}^{2}}, \tag{6}\]

where \(S\) and \(B\) are the expected numbers of signal and background events, respectively, \(\sigma^{\prime}\equiv\sigma\times BR\), and \(\epsilon_{\rm sys}\) is the systematic uncertainty arising mainly from the limited precision of the luminosity. A conservative value of \(\epsilon_{\rm sys}=10\%\) is assumed, which is consistent with the 5-10% accuracy [11] expected for hadron-collider experiments.

The variation of the production rate, \(\sigma\times BR\), and the corresponding fractional error is shown in Fig. 9 for the aforementioned channels. The rate depends strongly on the value of \(\tan\beta\), allowing thus its direct determination. However, it also depends on the mass of the pseudoscalar Higgs boson, \(m_{\rm A}\). Therefore, both dependencies --on \(\sigma\times BR\) and \(m_{\rm A}\)-- have to be taken into account, in order to estimate \(\tan\beta\). The corresponding error also consists of two contributions; \(\Delta\sigma^{\prime}\) and \(\Delta m_{\rm A}\). Hence, since the function \(\sigma^{\prime}=\sigma^{\prime}(m_{\rm A},\,\tan\beta)\) is known from theoretical calculations and \(m_{\rm A}\) can be determined experimentally (see previous section), \(\tan\beta\) can be unambiguously measured with an error

\[\frac{\Delta\tan\beta}{\tan\beta}=\frac{\sigma^{\prime}}{\tan\beta}\frac{ \partial\tan\beta}{\partial\sigma^{\prime}}\bigg{|}_{m_{\rm A}}\left(\frac{ \Delta\sigma^{\prime}}{\sigma^{\prime}}\right)\oplus\frac{m_{\rm A}}{\tan \beta}\frac{\partial\tan\beta}{\partial m_{\rm A}}\bigg{|}_{\sigma^{\prime}} \left(\frac{\Delta m_{\rm A}}{m_{\rm A}}\right). \tag{7}\]

The partial derivatives have been calculated numerically, after rearranging the available values of \(\sigma^{\prime}=\sigma^{\prime}(m_{\rm A},\,\tan\beta)\) into the form \(\tan\beta=\tan\beta(\sigma^{\prime},\,m_{\rm A})\). The partial derivative for fixed, e.g., \(m_{\rm A}\), is then evaluated as the slope of several adjacent (\(\sigma^{\prime}\), \(\tan\beta\)) points.

The derived fractional error on \(\tan\beta\) in the \((m_{\rm A},\,\tan\beta)\) plane is depicted in Fig. 10 for the H/A \(\rightarrow\tau\tau\), H/A \(\rightarrow\mu\mu\) and H \(\rightarrow\) ZZ\({}^{(*)}\)\(\rightarrow\) 4\(\ell\) channels. The dependence of \(\Delta\tan\beta/\tan\beta\) as a function of \(\tan\beta\) for \(m_{\rm A}=150\) GeV and \(m_{\rm A}=300\) GeV is also shown in Fig. 11.

If the signal were to be observed in the H \(\rightarrow\) ZZ\({}^{(*)}\)\(\rightarrow\) 4\(\ell\) channel, which is visible for low \(\tan\beta\), the measured signal rate would allow a measurement of \(\tan\beta\) with an accuracy of 10% to 30%, for an integrated luminosity of \(\rm H/A\to\gamma\gamma\) and \(\rm H/A\to\gamma\gamma\). This is feasible only in the region where \(m_{\rm A}\) can be measured via the \(\rm A\to\gamma\gamma\) or \(\rm A\to Zh\to\ell\ell b\overline{b}\) channel (see Fig. 3), i.e. for \(m_{\rm A}>200\) GeV. However, the precision is limited to 10% at best, since the signal rate for this channel is low.

If the signal were to be obtained in the \(\rm H/A\to\tau\tau\) channel, the measured signal rate would provide good sensitivity to \(\tan\beta\). For example, for \(m_{\rm A}\) = 150 GeV and an integrated luminosity of 300 \(\rm fb^{-1}\), \(\tan\beta\) can be measured with an accuracy of \(\pm 15\%\) for \(\tan\beta\)=5 and of \(\pm 6\%\) for \(\tan\beta\)=40.

For large values of \(\tan\beta\), better sensitivity can be achieved with the \(\rm H/A\to\mu\mu\) channel, e.g., \(\pm 12\%\) for \(\tan\beta\)=10 and \(\pm 5\%\) for \(\tan\beta\)=40 (for \(m_{\rm A}\) = 150 GeV). Generally, at high \(\tan\beta\) the accuracy can be improved by combining the results from the \(\rm H/A\to\tau\tau\) and \(\rm H/A\to\mu\mu\) channels.

## 5 Conclusions

If supersymmetry is to be observed during the operation of the ATLAS experiment, the measurement of the Higgs-boson masses will be feasible in a variety of decay channels. Thus, the masses of the lighter, \(\rm h^{0}\), and of the two heavy, neutral Higgs bosons, \(\rm H^{0}\) and \(\rm A^{0}\), can be determined with an accuracy ranging from \(\sim\)0.1% to \(\sim\)3% in a large fraction of their discovery regions in the MSSM parameter space. To a large extent, the precision is fixed by the systematic error, being 0.1% for signatures involving leptons and photons and 1% for jets and taus.

The range of the expected precision provided by each channel, for an integrated luminosity of 300 \(\rm fb^{-1}\), is summarized in Table 2.

Another possible measurement is that of the parameter \(\tan\beta\). Since the production rates of some decay channels, such as \(\rm H/A\to\tau\tau\) and \(\rm H/A\to\mu\mu\), are sensitive to it, the measurement of their rates provides a handle to determine this parameter. For large values of \(\tan\beta\), a fractional error of 5-26% can be achieved, if only the \(\rm H/A\to\tau\tau\) channel is visible. The precision, however, is slightly enhanced to 5-13% in larger values of \(\tan\beta\), where the \(\rm H/A\to\mu\mu\) mode is also attainable.

## Appendix A Truncated Gaussian probability density

During the determination of the peak position in an effective mass distribution, only events lying within a mass window are taken into account. Hence, it would be more sensible to employ the truncated rather than the full-range Gaussian distribution in order to estimate the corresponding error. For this purpose, we define the probability distribution function3

Footnote 3: For simplicity, the mean value has been set equal to zero.

\[f(x)=\begin{cases}0&\text{if }|x|>n\sigma,\\ \frac{A}{\sigma\sqrt{2\pi}}\exp\left(-\frac{x^{2}}{2\sigma^{2}}\right)&\text{ if }|x|<n\sigma,\end{cases}\]

where \([-n\sigma,\,+n\sigma]\) is the mass window and \(A\) is a normalization constant,

\[A=\left[\frac{1}{\sigma\sqrt{2\pi}}\int_{-n\sigma}^{n\sigma}\mathrm{d}x\exp \left(-\frac{x^{2}}{2\sigma^{2}}\right)\right]^{-1}.\] (A.1)

\[{\sigma^{\prime}}^{2} = \int_{-n\sigma}^{n\sigma}\mathrm{d}x\,x^{2}f(x)\] \[\Rightarrow{\sigma^{\prime}}^{2} = \frac{A}{\sigma\sqrt{2\pi}}\int_{-n\sigma}^{n\sigma}\mathrm{d}x\, x^{2}\exp\left(-\frac{x^{2}}{2\sigma^{2}}\right)\] \[\Rightarrow{\sigma^{\prime}}^{2} = \sigma^{2}\frac{A}{\sqrt{2\pi}}\int_{-n}^{n}\mathrm{d}y\,y^{2} \exp\left(-\frac{y^{2}}{2}\right),\quad y\equiv\frac{x}{\sigma}.\] (A.2)

If we define the parameter \(c(n)\) as

\[c(n)\equiv\frac{\int_{-n}^{n}\mathrm{d}y\,y^{2}\exp\left(-\frac{y^{2}}{2} \right)}{\int_{-n}^{n}\mathrm{d}y\exp\left(-\frac{y^{2}}{2}\right)},\]

Equations (A) and (A.2) yield

\[{\sigma^{\prime}}^{2}=\sigma^{2}c(n).\]

Therefore, the statistical error on the determination of the mean value, after having observed \(N_{S}\) events in the mass window is

\[\Delta m=\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{N_{S}}}\sqrt{c(n)}.\] (A.3)

## Appendix B Two overlapping Gaussians

### Condition for discrimination of the two peaks

In this appendix, the condition under which two overlapping Gaussian peaks can be distinguished is discussed. More precisely, the problem is the determination of the minimum difference of the mean values in terms of standard deviations, for which only one peak is observed.

Suppose two samples of size \(N_{1}\) and \(N_{2}\) from the Gaussian distributions \(g_{1}\) and \(g_{2}\), respectively, which have the same standard deviation \(\sigma\) and different mean values \(m_{1}\) and \(m_{2}\) (\(m_{2}>m_{1}\)). Thus their superposition will be described by the (normalized to unity) distribution function \(G\),

\[G(x)=\frac{1}{N_{1}+N_{2}}[N_{1}g_{1}(x)+N_{2}g_{2}(x)]\]or, equivalently,

\[G(x)=\frac{c_{1}}{\sigma}\exp\left[-\frac{(x-m_{1})^{2}}{2\sigma^{2}}\right]+ \frac{c_{2}}{\sigma}\exp\left[-\frac{(x-m_{2})^{2}}{2\sigma^{2}}\right],\]

where

\[c_{i}=\frac{N_{i}}{\sqrt{2\pi}(N_{1}+N_{2})},\quad i=1,\,2.\]

If this distribution exhibits only one peak, this means that \(G\) does not have any local minimum, i.e., for all the points \(x_{0}\), such that \(G^{\prime}(x_{0})=0\), it will be \(G^{\prime\prime}(x_{0})<0\).

For the first derivative of \(G\) at \(x=x_{0}\), one gets

\[G^{\prime}(x_{0})=0\Rightarrow\\ -\frac{c_{1}}{\sigma^{3}}(x_{0}-m_{1})\exp\left[-\frac{(x_{0}-m_{1 })^{2}}{2\sigma^{2}}\right]-\frac{c_{2}}{\sigma^{3}}(x_{0}-m_{2})\exp\left[- \frac{(x_{0}-m_{2})^{2}}{2\sigma^{2}}\right]=0\Rightarrow\\ c_{2}\exp\left[-\frac{(x_{0}-m_{2})^{2}}{2\sigma^{2}}\right]=-c_ {1}\frac{x_{0}-m_{1}}{x_{0}-m_{2}}\exp\left[-\frac{(x_{0}-m_{1})^{2}}{2\sigma^ {2}}\right],\]

and \(m_{1}<x_{0}<m_{2}\) for a finite \(x_{0}\).

Thus, the second derivative of \(G\) at the minima and maxima can be expressed in the form

\[G^{\prime\prime}(x_{0})=\\ -\frac{c_{1}}{\sigma^{3}}\left\{\left[1-\frac{(x_{0}-m_{1})^{2}}{ \sigma^{2}}\right]-\frac{x_{0}-m_{1}}{x_{0}-m_{2}}\left[1-\frac{(x_{0}-m_{2})^ {2}}{\sigma^{2}}\right]\right\}\exp\left[-\frac{(x_{0}-m_{1})^{2}}{2\sigma^{2} }\right].\]

The quantity \(G^{\prime\prime}(x_{0})\) is negative, if the expression in the brackets is positive. The latter is simplified by introducing the quantities \(y_{0}\equiv(x_{0}-m_{1})/\sigma\) and \(\alpha\equiv(m_{2}-m_{1})/(2\sigma)\). Hence, the condition for observing only one peak becomes:

\[y_{0}^{2}-2\alpha y_{0}+1>0\]

The last relation holds for every value of \(y_{0}\), if

\[\Delta<0\Rightarrow\alpha(\alpha-1)<0\Rightarrow\alpha<1,\]

or, in general, if

\[|m_{1}-m_{2}|<2\sigma.\]

Therefore, when the last condition is fulfilled, the two Gaussians cannot be discriminated.

### Discrimination of two peaks by fitting with two Gaussians

The discrimination of two Gaussians may be feasible even for mass differences lower than \(2\sigma_{m}\), if one exploits the knowledge of the expected resolution of the peak, which can be estimated from dedicated Monte Carlo studies. The possibility of observing these peaks and measuring the Higgs boson masses is discussed in this appendix.

Two Gaussian peaks and an exponential background were simulated for various values of \(m_{\rm H}-m_{\rm A}\), ranging from 0-2.5\(\sigma_{m}\). The pseudoscalar Higgs boson mass was fixed at \(m_{\rm A}=300\) GeV while \(m_{\rm H}\) was varying. The produced number of events and the resolution (\(\sigma_{m}=10\) GeV) are of the order of the ones expected from other studies [3, 7]. The spectra were fitted using two functions; one exponential plus one Gaussian ('G+B' fit) or one exponential plus two Gaussians ('G+G+B' fit). In both cases the resolution was fixed to the actual value (10 GeV). To eliminate the statistical error of the results, this procedure was repeated 3,000 times.

The produced distributions and the corresponding fit results are shown in Fig. 12 for \(m_{\rm H}-m_{\rm A}=0.6\), 1.2, 1.8 and 2.4\(\sigma_{m}\). The more the mass difference, the more insufficient is the 'G+B' fit for describing

Figure 12: Signal and background distribution fitted either with the ‘G+B’ fit and with the ‘G+G+B’ fit.

the 'G+G+B' fit describes it consistently. This is evident in the evolution of the \(\chi^{2}\)-value, shown in Fig. 13.

In Fig. 13, it becomes clear that the difference in the \(\chi^{2}\)-values of the two fitting procedures is sensitive to the mass difference. More precisely, for \(m_{\rm H}-m_{\rm A}\gtrsim 1.2\sigma_{m}\) a \(5\sigma\)-significant \(\Delta\chi^{2}\)-value can be observed.

The distributions of \(m_{\rm H}\), \(m_{\rm A}\) and \(m_{\rm H}-m_{\rm A}\), as estimated by the 'G+G+B' fit are shown in Figures 14, 15 and 16, respectively, for various values of the mass difference. The values for \(m_{\rm H}\) and \(m_{\rm A}\) exhibit an asymmetric distribution, which tends to be eliminated as \(m_{\rm H}-m_{\rm A}\) increases. Hence, all the histograms were fitted with 'two half Gaussians' with the same mean values and different standard deviations, in order to account for this asymmetry.

The resolution also enhances as the mass difference becomes larger.

In Fig. 17, the estimated values and errors for \(m_{\rm H}\) and \(m_{\rm A}\) (with the 'G+G+B' fit) are shown as a function of the mass difference. The measured values tend to be near to the mean value, but the errors cover the actual values. For \(m_{\rm H}-m_{\rm A}\gtrsim 2\sigma_{m}\), however, the estimation is unbiased and the

errors decrease to \(\sim 0.5\%\). The corresponding values for the estimated peak position, \(<\)\(m\)\(>\), when fitting with 'G+B', diverge from the mean value of the two Higgs boson masses, as this fitting function becomes insufficient to describe the spectrum.

As for the mass difference estimation is concerned, this is not reliable for \(m_{\rm H}-m_{\rm A}\lesssim 2\sigma_{m}\), since the fit gives systematically much higher or much lower values for \(m_{\rm H}-m_{\rm A}\) than the actual ones. Nevertheless, for large mass differences (\(\gtrsim 2\sigma_{m}\)), the mass difference can be estimated with an accuracy of \(\pm 8\%\).

In conclusion, the possible existence of two overlapping peaks can be probed by the comparison of the goodness of fit between 'G+B' and 'G+G+B' for a mass difference as low as \(\sim 1.2\sigma_{m}\). Nevertheless, an unbiased estimation of the Higgs boson masses, \(m_{\rm H}\) and \(m_{\rm A}\), together with their difference is only feasible for \(m_{\rm H}-m_{\rm A}\gtrsim 2\sigma_{m}\).

Since, as shown in Figures 4 and 5, the mass difference in the discovery regions of the discussed channels is \(\lesssim 1\sigma_{m}\), the previous study does not apply to this case. If, however, the discovery region extended and/or the resolution enhanced in the future, the discrimination of the peaks would be relevant.

### Calculation of the mean value and its variance

Suppose three superimposed probability distributions, \(f_{1}\), \(f_{2}\), \(f_{3}\), with sample sizes \(N_{i}\), \(i=1\), 2, 3. The resulting distribution has a probability density

\[f(x)=\sum_{i=1}^{3}c_{i}f_{i}(x),\qquad c_{i}\equiv\frac{N_{i}}{N_{1}+N_{2}+N_{3 }},\ \ i=1,\,2,\,3,\]

with mean value and variance given by the relations

\[\langle x\rangle=\sum_{i=1}^{3}c_{i}m_{i},\] (B.1)

\[\sigma^{2}=\sum_{i=1}^{3}c_{i}\sigma_{i}^{2}+c_{1}c_{2}(m_{1}-m_{2})^{2}+c_{2 }c_{3}(m_{2}-m_{3})^{2}+c_{3}c_{1}(m_{3}-m_{1})^{2},\] (B.2)

where the mean values and variances of the overlapping densities are denoted by \(m_{i}\) and \(\sigma_{i}^{2}\), \(i=1\), 2, 3, respectively.

In our case, we have two overlapping Gaussians --from the decay of A\({}^{0}\) and H\({}^{0}\)-- and a uniform distribution representing the background. The mean values of the normal distributions correspond to the Higgs bosons' masses, \(m_{1}=m_{\rm A}\) and \(m_{2}=m_{\rm H}\) (\(m_{\rm A}<m_{\rm H}\)). Since the mass resolutions \(\sigma_{\rm A}\) and \(\sigma_{\rm H}\) are almost equal, we may assume for simplicity that: \(\sigma_{1}^{2}=\sigma_{2}^{2}=\sigma_{m}^{2}\equiv(\sigma_{\rm A}^{2}+\sigma_ {\rm H}^{2})/2\). The uniform distribution in the interval \([m_{\rm A}-n\sigma_{m},\,m_{\rm H}+n\sigma_{m}]\) has a mean value of \(m_{3}=(m_{\rm A}+m_{\rm H})/2\) and a standard deviation \(\sigma_{3}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{12}}(\delta m+2n\sigma_{m})\), where \(\delta m\equiv m_{\rm H}-m_{\rm A}\). If we denote by \(N_{\rm A}\), \(N_{\rm H}\) and \(N_
