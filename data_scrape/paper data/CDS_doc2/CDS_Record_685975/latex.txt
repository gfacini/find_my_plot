Bulk radiation damage in the pixel and silicon strip sensors in the ATLAS Semi-Conductor Tracker (SCT) will result in substantial increases in the depletion voltages, \(V_{\it dep}\). In this note, depletion voltages are modelled for sensors positioned at four radii (4cm, 11.5cm, 15cm and 25cm), at three possible operating temperatures (\(-\)10\({}^{\circ}\)C, \(-\)5\({}^{\circ}\)C and 0\({}^{\circ}\)C), and for two candidate yearly maintenance scenarios (1 day/year at 20\({}^{\circ}\)C and 7 days/year at 20\({}^{\circ}\)C). The implications of the different cooling and maintenance scenarios are significant only near the end of the 10 year lifetime for the SCT. Sensors at 4 cm radius have a short lifetime at full luminosity and tolerate all scenarios. For the other radii an operating temperature of 0\({}^{\circ}\)C results in increases of \(V_{\it dep}\) that are greater than the differences from the other two temperatures or from the two maintenance scenarios. Thus an operating temperature of 0\({}^{\circ}\)C is probably too warm. The differences between the two maintenance scenarios or between \(-\)5\({}^{\circ}\)C and \(-\)10\({}^{\circ}\)C in operating temperature increase with time and correspond to approximately a one year in variation of the SCT lifetime by the end of the proposed 10 year operation of the SCT.

## 2 Simulation Results and Implications

The simulation results are shown in Figs 1-4 for SCT layers at radii of 4cm, 11.5cm, 15cm and 25cm respectively. Part A) of each figure includes all the depletion voltage predictions for three possible operating temperatures and for two yearly maintenance scenarios. Part B) of the figure shows the depletion voltage predictions for the maintenance scenario of 1 day/year at 20\({}^{\circ}\)C. The predicted depletion voltages have _not_ been corrected for \(\sim\) 10% reductions in \(V_{dep}\) for sensor operating temperatures of \(\leq\) 0\({}^{\circ}\)C [1].

Sensors at 4cm radius have a short lifetime at full luminosity and tolerate all scenarios. For the other radii an operating temperature of 0\({}^{\circ}\)C results in increases of \(V_{dep}\) that are greater than the differences from the other two temperatures or from the two maintenance scenarios. Thus an operating temperature of 0\({}^{\circ}\)C is probably too warm. The differences between the two maintenance scenarios or between \(-\)5\({}^{\circ}\)C and \(-\)10\({}^{\circ}\)C in operating temperature are significant only near the end of the 10 year lifetime for the SCT and correspond to approximately a one year variation in SCT lifetime.
