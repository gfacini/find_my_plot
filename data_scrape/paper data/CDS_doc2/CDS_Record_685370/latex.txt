CERN

We present results from the 1996 test beam activities. Pulse shapes of two MDTs were read out with a FADC. As a reference system we used a silicon telescope to measure the muon track with an accuracy of about \(10\,\mu m\). The analysis of pulse shapes of the inefficient events gave answer to the nature of the inefficiencies. Double track separation was studied by overlaying measured muon signals with signals from a Bi207 \(\gamma\) source in software.

Introduction

Inefficiencies in the MDTs have two main reasons:

* The induced current signal stays below the threshold or the threshold exceeds the first maximum following the leading edge (Fig.1).
* A particle which is either created by the muon along it's track or is coming from some other source deposits charge in the MDT at the same time as the muon such that the leading edge of the corresponding signal precedes the muon leading edge. The signals of the 2 events overlay and the muon track is lost (Fig 2).

The inefficiency due to signals not exceeding the threshold is negligible in our case since the signal to noise ratio is very high for our choice of gas gain and pressure (3 bars, gas gain \(2\times 10^{4}\)).

Shadowing of the muons by signals from other particles is a more serious problem. There is a fundamental efficiency limit from delta electrons created by the muon in the tube wall or the counting gas.

Another source of inefficiency are tracks from uncorrelated background particles like neutrons and photons. This kind of inefficiency clearly is background rate dependent.

Using strong tail cancellation filters or two discriminators with different thresholds one can identify piled up leading edges and increase the efficiency.

Figure 1: _Inefficiency due to signals staying below the threshold and signals where threshold loses the leading edge._

Figure 2: _Inefficiency due to a particle shadowing the muon. A second discriminator or strong tail cancellation together with a higher threshold can help to recuperate some of the shadowed hits._

## 2 Setup

The setup is shown in (Fig. 3). 6 planes of silicon strip detectors were used. 4 'Y' planes and 2 'X' planes. The muon track at the position of the tubes can be predicted with an accuracy of about 10 \(\mu m\). The tubes were built at MPI [2], the silicon telescope was provided by LMU [1].

The FADC has a sampling frequency of 250MHz (4ns time bins) and a dynamic range of 7 bits. (Fig. 4) shows an example of muon signals.

Pulses of a Bi207 source (0.57, 1.1, 1.8 MeV gammas) were recorded as well. To study double track separation they were overlayed to muon signals in software. Of course it would have been better to simulate the photon background by putting the source on the tube while recording the muons. This was not possible due to the fact that in the M2 area we could not use a source that allowed a counting rate comparable to the ATLAS background level.

## 3 Inefficiency due to Signals not exceeding the Threshold

One run with 40000 triggers was used for the following analysis. The gas gain was \(2\times 10^{4}\) which requires a voltage of 3270V.

The discriminator threshold was set to \(5\sigma\) of the noise. To calibrate the threshold an Am source (60 keV photons) together with a Mb foil (17.2 keV fluorescence line) was used. The 17.2 keV photons create clusters of around 662 electrons (the effective ionization potential for Argon is 26eV). Dividing the peak of the photon pulse by 662 yields the pulse height for one ionization electron.

For this setup the \(5\sigma\) noise threshold corresponds to 18 electrons at a gain of \(2\times 10^{4}\).

The pulse shape recorded with the FADC is used to to find the signal maximum and the hit time for different thresholds. This is done the following way: The threshold set at the discriminator as well as a higher threshold are applied to the pulse shape in software. The time difference of the two threshold crossing times is then added to the TDC hit.

(Fig. 5) shows the signal maxima versus the position of the muon track. The average pulse height increases towards the tube wall and then falls off steeply because the track length goes to zero. 99.5 % of the pulse heights are larger than the values indicated by the solid line. The reason for the increase of pulse height towards the wall can be seen from (Fig. 6).

By fitting a straight line to both edges of the curve shown in (Fig. 5) we find the region where the MDT starts to be efficient (Fig. 7).

Figure 5: _Signal maxima versus distance of the track from the wire. The left figure shows all the events. 99.5% of the pulses are larger that the values indicated by the solid line. The right figure shows a magnification of this line._Figure 6: _Charge focusing effect. For tracks close to the wire the electrons come in ’one after the other’, whereas for tracks far from the wire a big amount of charge arrives at the wire at the same time which results in a higher signal._

Figure 7: _This graph indicates the distance from the tube wall where the hit-efficiency is 99.5%._

Up to a threshold of 40 electrons the central region of the tube is very efficient (\(\epsilon>99.5\%\)). However we have to be careful in interpreting this since the signal maximum is not necessarily the maximum following the leading edge, in fact it can be anywhere within the whole signal (Fig. 4). The interesting number is the fraction of hits outside \(3\sigma\) and \(5\sigma\) of the resolution. These values are shown in the next chapter.

## 4 Inefficiencies due to Electromagnetic Secondaries and Charge Fluctuations.

Secondary particles that are created in the tube wall or the gas deposit the charge at the same time as the muon. They can only spoil the muon hit if the corresponding signal precedes the muon leading edge by more than \(2-3\sigma\) of the MDT resolution (Fig. 8). By definition there can't be any inefficiency for tracks through the centre of the tube.

For tracks close to the wire, where the charge arrives at the wire only within a long time, one loses the signal leading edge by using high thresholds.

We define an event as inefficient if the position, predicted by the rt-relation, is outside \(3\sigma\) or \(5\sigma\) of the position predicted by the silicon telescope where \(\sigma\) is the MDT resolution at the given position for the given threshold. The resolution for different thresholds can be seen in (Fig. 9).

(Fig. 10) shows the track positions versus threshold crossing time for different thresholds. The width of the 'V-band' corresponds to the MDT resolution. The two types of inefficiencies are immediately visible from these plots:

* The points 'below' the curve correspond to hits from delta electrons. The number of them is almost independent of the threshold.
* The hits 'above' the curve correspond to events where the threshold exceeds the first leading edge. This kind of inefficiency is of course threshold dependent.

To check whether the inefficiency is due to shower particles coming with the muon in the beam one counts the events that are inefficient in two adjacent tubes for the same event. About \(0.8\%\) of all events were inefficient in both tubes. Whether this is due to shower

Figure 8: _Only if a secondary particle from the tube wall or the counting gas enters the region indicated by the circle it will hide the muon. There can’t be any inefficiency from secondaries for tracks very close to the wire._

Figure 10: _TDC hits versus track position. The hits ’below’ the curve are delta electrons hiding the muon track. The hits ’above’ the curve indicate events where the threshold exceeds the first maximum following the leading edge._

Figure 12: _MDT inefficiency for different thresholds. The inefficiency for a threshold of 18 electrons is only due to delta electrons. By raising the threshold one starts to lose leading edges for tracks close to the wire and one also starts to exceed the pulses close to the wall. The points were evaluated in 1mm bins from 0mm to 14mm, the last point correspond to a bin from 14mm to 14.6mm._

Figure 13: _Total inefficiency for different thresholds. It is defined by the fraction of hits outside 3/5 \(\sigma\) of the position, predicted by the silicon telescope, in the entire region from \(-14.6mm-14.6mm\). The right figure shows the difference of expected hit time (calculated from the silicon telescope track via the rt-relation) and the actual hit. The width of the peak corresponds to the resolution, the tails are the hits from delta electrons shadowing the muon. The small tails to the left are due to the reduced resolution at the wire._

## 5 Inefficiencies due to uncorrelated Background and other correlated Background Sources

### Background Characteristics

All calculations on the characteristics of the uncorrelated background were done by A. Ferrari [4]. The results were already discussed in [5] and are repeated here shortly for completeness. (Fig. 14) shows the expected background photon spectrum for the ATLAS muon spectrometer. This spectrum has to be folded with the sensitivity of the detector gas and the aluminium tubes. The relevant numbers for the dead time spectrum are the outer and inner enveloping radius of the background track together with the energy deposit (Fig 14).

These numbers were calculated the following way:

1. \(6*10^{6}\) photons were randomly picked from the above spectrum.
2. The photons were sent isotropically through 3 layers of 14 Al tubes (400\(\mu m\) wall) filled with 3 bars (absolute) of Ar/N2/Ch4 91/4/5. The magnetic field was assumed to be 0.4T parallel to the wire.
3. The inner and outer enveloping radius of the charged particle track together with the

Figure 14: _Photon spectrum for the barrel region. The high energy photons will mostly create Compton electrons. The numbers that determines the dead time are the outer and the inner enveloping radius of the track created by the electron._energy deposited was calculated for each interacting photon.

(Fig. 16) shows the results of the calculation.

We see that the secondary electrons either come out of the wall or dump in the wall. The energy deposit spectrum of the photon background can be seen from (Fig. 15).

To test double track separation with realistic photon background pulse shapes we recorded pulses from a Bi207 \(\gamma\) source. These photons knock electrons out of the tube wall and the gas and create tracks isotropically. Therefore the average pulse height of these signals is about 1.7 times higher than signals from particles crossing the tube perpendicular to the wire.

Figure 15: _Energy deposited by background photons. The average energy deposit is 32keV which is about twice as much as the energy deposited by high energy muons perpendicular to the wire._

Figure 16: _The first figure shows the number of tubes which are hit by a single background event. For explanation of the other histograms see (Fig. 14). The simulations were done for a magnetic field of 0.4 T._

### Double Track Separation

The use of a strong tail cancellation circuit for double track separation was already discussed in [5]. The frontend electronics circuit for this study is shown in (Fig. 17). Simulations showed that 2 overlayed signals can be separated with an efficiency of ca. 80 % if their leading edges are separated by more that 100ns. 2 separate channels are necessary since for high separation efficiency we must apply a high threshold which degrades the resolution by an unacceptable amount.

This result was derived from simulation and is only true for signals from tracks perpendicular to the wire. Most of the uncorrelated background hits are due to photons creating Compton electrons isotropically, so the average energy deposit of these electrons is about 2 times higher than that one for photons. A study on separation of muons and photons

Figure 17: _’Old’ schematic of the MDT fronted electronics. Channel 1 with the lowest possible threshold (5\(\sigma\) noise) for good resolution and one hit/signal. Channel 2 with a high threshold for high double track separation efficiency. Since 2 separate channel are quite expensive some alternatives have been studied._will follow below. Also high cost of a second TDC channel made studies on alternatives necessary.

Signals from muons and Bi207 photons were recorded with a FADC. Overlaying the signals and tail cancellation were performed in software. This is assumed to be a very realistic simulation of the case where there are really two tracks in the MDT since space charge effects that could influence the different clusters are negligible at the gain of \(2\times 10^{4}\). The experimental setup is the same as described in chapter two. Typical signals from muons and Bi207 photons are shown in (Fig. 18).

The separation efficiency for a muon and a shadowing track perpendicular to the wire is determined the following way (note that in that case the 2 pulses have the same trailing edge):

* The leading edges of 2 muon pulses are determined.
* The two signals are overlayed.
* If the leading edge of the second pulse is within 3 sigma of one of the leading edges of the overlayed signal we call the 2 tracks separated.

The separation efficiency of a muon and an uncorrelated background event were simulated the following way:

* The photon pulse was shifted randomly within a window of \(2\times\) the maximum drift time.
* The leading and trailing edges of a muon signal and a Bi207 signal are determined.
* If the photon leading edge arrives _before_ the muon leading edge and the last trailing edge of the photon signal arrives _after_ the muon leading edge (only in that case we really have a shadowing event) the two signals are overlayed.
* If the leading edge of the muon pulse is within 3 sigma of one of the leading edges of the overlayed signal we call the 2 tracks separated.

The results of the analysis for different front end schematics are discussed in the following sections.

Figure 18: _Typical signals from muons and from electrons created by \(\gamma\)’s from a Bi207 source for a gas gain of \(2\times 10^{4}\). The tail cancellation is done with a double pole/zero circuit. With a hysteresis of half the threshold the average number of hits per signal is very close to 1. Clearly if two of these signals pile up the second leading edge is lost._

### Two Filter Scheme

The first schematic under study is given in (Fig. 19). It consists of two switchable filter chains, a time over threshold output and a leading edge+ADC output. Applying the strong tail cancellation filter and applying a high threshold we can perform double track separation.

(Fig. 20) indicates how this scheme works.

(Fig. 21) shows separation efficiencies for the overlay of 2 muon signals which in real life would correspond to accompanying shower particles or other correlated background signals with tracks perpendicular to the wire. The separation efficiency is about 80% in good agreement with the simulations. The discriminator output is set high when the signal goes above threshold, then the signal charge is integrated for 20ns and encoded into a time. After that time the discriminator output is set low.

(Fig. 24) shows the separation efficiency for muons and photon signals. The efficiency is only about 60% which is due to the fact that the isotropic electron tracks create signals that are about two times higher than the muon signals.

(Fig 27) shows the tendencies of hit numbers and resolution of the second hit versus threshold.

We conclude for this scheme:

* For a threshold of 50 electrons the average number of hits per single signal is around 1.5. In case of a double track there are on average 2.4 hits.
* The separation efficiency is around 80% for a muon and a track perpendicular to the wire and around 60% for a muon track and an isotropic background track if the leading edges are separated by more than 80ns.
* The resolution of the second track is 150 \(\mu m\) and 175\(\mu m\) respectively.

Figure 19: _In this scheme the fronted electronics has 2 filter chains. In normal mode one would use the standard tail cancellation filter and a low threshold and one can optionally read leading and trailing edge or leading edge (1) and ADC (2). In case of troubles with high occupancies one would switch to the strong tail cancellation filter, apply a higher threshold without hysteresis and read out the leading edge and ADC channel (2). One would get quite good double track separation efficiency and still good leading edge resolution by recuperating the loss in resolution due to the high threshold by doing a time slewing correction with the charge measurement [5]._

Figure 20: Using strong tail cancellation there is some probability that the muon leading edge is found even of it is piled up with a photon background hit. The horizontal line indicates a threshold of 50 electrons.

Figure 23: Pulse width and the time between the pulses (gap width) of the discriminator output. The dotted line corresponds to single tracks, the solid line corresponds to double tracks. Note that these histograms show the pulse and gap width for the mode where the charge is encoded in the discriminator output. The gate assumed is 20ns and the charge information is converted into a time proportional to the charge.

Figure 21: _Separation efficiency for tracks perpendicular to the wire for the strong tail cancellation scheme. The efficiency is close to 80% as indicated by the simulation studies. The second histogram shows the additional bias in resolution for the overlayed track. For a gas with a drift velocity of about \(30\mu m/ns\) this would correspond to an additional bias of 90 micron which has to be added in square to the nominal resolution at the given threshold._

Figure 26: Pulse width and the time between the pulses (gap width) of the discriminator output. The dotted line corresponds to single tracks, the solid line corresponds to double tracks.

Figure 24: Separation efficiency for muons and pulses from Bi208 photons for the strong tail cancellation scheme. The separation efficiency is lower due to the fact that the photon pulses are on average twice as high as the muon pulses. One can imagine that a ’small’ muon pulse being hidden by a ’big’ photon pulse is affected more than the muon-muon case in the previous figure. This can also be seen by the bigger bias in resolution.

Figure 25: Average number of hits per single track and per double track.

Figure 27: _Tendencies for hit numbers and resolution of the second hit for different thresholds (strong tail cancellation scheme). A higher threshold helps to reduce the number of hits and also to increase the separation efficiency. The resolution of the second hit is worse for the overlay of a muon and a photon since the photon pulses are higher._

### Two Discriminator Scheme

The second schematic under study is given in (Fig. 28).

(Fig. 29) indicates how this scheme works.

(Fig. 30) and (Fig. 33) shows the separation efficiencies for the overlay of two muon signals.

(Fig. 36) shows tendencies of separation efficiency, hit number and resolution of the second hit for this scheme.

We conclude for the double threshold scheme:

* Using a second discriminator with a threshold of 120 electrons and performing an OR with the ADC channel gives on average 1.7 hits per signal.
* A threshold of 120 electrons for the second discriminator gives a separation efficiency of 95% for tracks perpendicular to the wire and 75% for a muon and a background photon.
* The resolution of the second track is 150 \(\mu m\) and 175\(\mu m\) respectively. Still one has to take care of the systematic shift of the hit time.

Figure 28: _In this scheme the fronted electronics has 2 separate discriminators. In normal mode one would read only output (1) or (2) which gives one hit per signal. In case of trouble with high occupancies one would read out line (4) which is the OR of (2) and (3). The high threshold discriminator would have a fixed output pulse width of 10ns-20ns (\(<\) ADC gate), so the first pulse will always be ’eaten’ by the output pulse of line (2). Since the pulse width of the ADC channel is always \(>\) ADC gate we can identify pulses from the high and the low threshold. The advantage of this scheme is that one gets the good resolution for the first leading edge without the time slewing correction. The only disadvantage of this scheme is the fact that we get a systematic shift of the second hit time because we calculate the rt-relation from the low threshold hits._

Figure 29: A high threshold discriminator can identify the leading edge of the muon signal that is piled up with a photon background hit.

Figure 31: Average number of hits per single track and per double track.

Figure 32: Pulse width and the time between the pulses (gap width) of the discriminator output. The dotted line corresponds to single tracks, the solid line corresponds to double tracks. The pulses with a width of 10ns correspond to the output of the high threshold discriminator.

Figure 30: Separation efficiency for tracks perpendicular to the wire for the double threshold scheme. The efficiency is close to 80% as indicated by the simulation studies. The second histogram shows the additional bias in resolution for the overlayed track. For a gas with a drift velocity of about \(30\mu m/ns\) this would correspond to an additional bias of 105 micron which has to be added in square to the nominal resolution at the given threshold.

Figure 34: Average number of hits per single track and per double track.

Figure 33: Separation efficiency for muons and p_ulses from Bi208 photons for the double threshold scheme. The separation efficiency is lower due to the fact that the photon pulses are on average twice as high as the muon pulses. One can imagine that a ‘small’ muon pulse being hidden by a ‘big’ photon pulse is affected more than the muon-muon case in the previous figure. This can also be seen by the bigger bias in resolution.

Figure 36: _Threshold dependence of various parameters. The number of hits per single signal decreases by raising the threshold, the separation efficiency increases, the resolution of the recuperated hit decreases. One minor problem of the double threshold scheme is a systematic shift of the second track. We establish the rt-relation by using the hit times of the low threshold discriminator. If we use this rt-relation for the high threshold hits times we get a systematic shift of the track position. Since this shift only depends on the threshold we can correct for it._

Figure 39: _MDT inefficiency using the double threshold scheme (Fig. 28). For zero background rate we improve from 6% inefficiency to 4% inefficiency. The poor improvement is due to the fact that delta electrons are very close to the muon track. The efficiency dependence on the uncorrelated background rate can be reduced a lot by the using the double threshold scheme._

Conclusions

* For the nominal threshold of 20 electrons the muon efficiency i.e. the probability that the muon signal exceeds the threshold is very close to 100% if the muon crosses the tube at a distance of \(>150\mu m\) from the wall.
* The inefficiency due to secondaries created by the muon in the tube wall or the counting gas is 5%-6% and independent of the threshold (6% of the hits outside 3\(\sigma\) and 5% of the hits outside 5\(\sigma\) of the position).
* The inefficiency due to the fact that the threshold exceeds the leading edge is negligible for a threshold of 20 electrons but increases strongly by raising the threshold.
* Using strong tail cancellation and a threshold of 40-50 electrons, the probability for identifying a muon signal overlayed to the signal from a track perpendicular to the wire is 80% for a leading edge separation of \(>100ns\). For a muon overlayed to a photon signal the separation efficiency is only 65%. However this scheme is not recommended since we rely on the slewing correction to arrive at our nominal resolution and we also start to have inefficiencies close to the wire.
* Using standard tail cancellation and a second discriminator with a threshold of around 120 electrons, the separation efficiency is around 90% and 75%.
* At a tube counting rate of 300kHz (= occupancy of 10% for Ar/N2/CH4 91/4/5), the total inefficiency can be reduced from 15% to 7% using the double threshold scheme.
* Since the signal chain is AC coupled (decoupling capacitor) both tail cancellation scenarios described in this note require active baseline restoration in order to avoid baseline shift.
