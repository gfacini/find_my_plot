###### Abstract

We have analysed a possibility to determine the top quark charge in the ATLAS experiment at CERN LHC using two different approaches: the top charge reconstruction via its decay products and by determination of photon - top quark coupling in the radiative \(t\bar{t}\) events. Taking into account the realistic resolutions of the ATLAS detectors and the efficiency of signal reconstruction, \(b\)-tagging efficiency and using 10 \(fb^{-1}\) sample (one year at the LHC ) we have found that the ATLAS experiment potential for distinguishing between the standard model top quark and an exotic charge \(-4/3\) quark is very high for the both approaches.

## 1 Introduction

It is generally accepted that the particle discovered at Fermilab in 1995 [1], [2] is the Standard model (SM) top quark. On the other hand, in the analysis carried out by the CDF and D0 collaborations, the correlations of the b-quarks and W bosons in the process \(pp\to t\bar{t}\to W^{+}W^{-}b\bar{b}\) have not been determined (due to insufficient statistics). It means that at the time being the top quark electric charge is not measured and therefore one cannot exclude an alternative interpretation that is based on conception of a new exotic quark with charge \(-4/3\)[3]. It should be stated that this conception is also not excluded by the present precision electroweak data (from decay \(Z\to b\bar{b}\)), which are fully consistent with existence of an "exotic" quark of charge \(-4/3\) and mass \(\simeq 170~{}GeV\). There are several techniques to determine the electric charge of the top quark at present collider experiments (Tevatron and LHC experiments are taken into account). Discussion on this subject can be found in [4] and [5].

One of the technique of measuring the top quark electric charge (\(Q_{top}\)) is based on direct measurement of the top quark electromagnetic coupling through photon radiation in \(t\bar{t}\) events. Top quark can radiate a photon in both the production and decay processes. In the former case (radiative top production: \(pp\to t\bar{t}\gamma\)) the cross section is expected to be \(\sim Q_{top}^{2}\). In the latter case (radiative top decay: \(pp\to t\bar{t}\), \(t\to Wb\gamma\)) the situation is more complicated as photon can be radiated also from the \(b\)-quark and \(W\) boson line and the cross section is not exclusively proportional to \(\sim Q_{top}^{2}\), but nonetheless, depends on \(Q_{top}\). To measure the top charge we need to distinguish between the radiative processes sensitiveto \(Q_{top}\) and other radiative processes with the same experimental signature. The second methods is the top charge measurement based on the reconstruction of the charges of the top decay products. The dominant decay channel of the top quark is that to the \(b\)-quark via the charged current: \(t\to W^{+}b\) (\(\bar{t}\to W^{-}\bar{b}\)). For the top quark charge determination we need to determine the charge of both the \(W\) boson and the \(b\)-quark. While the charge of \(W\) boson can be determined through its leptonic decay, the \(b\) charge is not directly measurable due to quark confinement in hadrons. However there is a possibility to find a correlation between the charge of the \(b\)-quark and the hadrons belonging to the \(b\)-jet, which results from the hadronisation process of the \(b\)-quark. In this approach analysis of di-lepton events (\(t\bar{t}\to l^{+}\nu l^{-}\nu b\bar{b}\)) and single lepton plus jets ones (\(t\bar{t}\to l^{\pm}\nu jjb\bar{b}\)) looks plausible.

In the present work we have analysed both above mentioned approaches. At the analysis we have taken into account the realistic resolutions of the ATLAS detectors and the efficiency of signal reconstruction, the \(b\)-tagging efficiency and the 10 \(fb^{-1}\) sample (one year at the LHC) has been assumed. Recently an analysis of the top charge measurement using the first technique has been carried out for the Tevatron and LHC experiments [4]. The analysis, which was done on the particle level without using a realistic detector and reconstruction efficiencies, showed that the LHC experiments have a very good potential for exploitation of the radiative processes in \(t\bar{t}\) events for the top charge measurement. In our work we make a similar analysis of the radiative processes in \(t\bar{t}\) events for the ATLAS experiment but taking into account the realistic detector resolution and realistic reconstruction efficiencies.

The rest of this paper is organised as follows. In chapter two we discuss the top quark radiative processes as a means of the top quark charge determination. Details of cross section calculations of the processes needed in this approach are reported. It also contains a discussion on the selection criteria and the results for this option are presented. Chapter three is devoted to the determination of the top quark charge through its decay products. A method to determine the jet charge is described, the association of a lepton and a \(b\)-jet coming from the same top quark decay is discussed, and the results obtained in the frame of this approach are presented.

## 2 Calculation of top quark radiative processes

The essence of the top quark charge measurement via the photon radiation in \(t\bar{t}\) events consists in measuring of the cross sections of the processes sensitive to \(Q_{top}\). To cope with the problem we need to find effective selection criteria for detaching the \(Q_{top}\) sensitive processes and, at the same time, to suppress other radiative processes leading to the same event signature (background). Due to big value of the top mass in comparison with that of the \(W\) boson, the narrow width approximation can be utilised for the cross section calculations. This approximation means that the initial and final state particles of a given subprocess are taken as on-mass-shell ones. Keeping this in mind, for the top quark charge determination the following processes have been taken into account:

* Radiation in top production: \(pp\to\bar{t}t\gamma\to\gamma l^{\pm}\nu b\bar{b}jj\)* Radiative top decay: \(pp\to\bar{t}t\to\gamma W^{+}bW^{-}\bar{b}jj\to\gamma l^{\pm}\nu b\bar{b}jj\). Here either the \(t\) or \(\bar{t}\) quark decays radiatively (\(t\to Wb\gamma\)).
* Radiative \(W\) decay: \(pp\to\bar{t}t\to W^{+}bW^{-}\bar{b}jj\to\gamma l^{\pm}\nu b\bar{b}jj\). Here \(t\) or \(\bar{t}\) quark decays in a standard way, but one of the \(W\) bosons decays radiatively (\(W\to l\nu\gamma\) or \(W\to jj\gamma\) ).
* Other \(t\bar{t}\) processes leading to a high \(p_{T}\) photon ( \(\pi^{0}\) and \(\eta\) mesons produced in decays of the \(b\) quark and \(W\) boson, etc.).
* Non-\(t\bar{t}\) radiative background processes (\(W+jets+\gamma\), etc.).

The first two of them are possible signal processes, i.e. are \(Q_{top}\) sensitive, while the other represent the background.

**Radiative top production.** The radiation at \(t\bar{t}\) quark pair production is schematically shown in Fig.1. In the the narrow width approximation we can factorize the full process into the production phase (\(pp\to t\bar{t}\gamma\)) and the decay one(\(t\to Wb\)) and treat them separately.

The full set of the radiative top quark production with two gluons or \(u\bar{u}\) quark pair in initial state is shown in Fig.2. Since the \(t\bar{t}\) production is dominated by gluon fusion at the LHC, one expects that the \(pp\to t\bar{t}\gamma\) cross section should be proportional to \(Q_{top}^{2}\).

**Radiative top quark decay.** In the radiative top decay the photon can be radiated off the \(t\), \(b\) or \(W\) line, but photons from the \(W\) and the \(b\) lines do not "feel" the top charge. On the other hand, due to the interference of the main diagrams (see Fig.3) we cannot distinguish the process with radiating \(t\)-line from the other two cases. In connection with the top charge, as it was shown in [4], the interference contribution is positive in the case of \(Q_{top}=2/3\) and negative (destructive interference) for \(Q_{top}=-4/3\). It means, that the cross section for the radiative top decay for \(Q_{top}=-4/3\) is a factor 3 to 5 times smaller than that for \(Q_{top}=2/3\).

_Remark._ For better understanding of the difference between the radiative top decay and radiative top production it can be said, from theoretical point of view, that in the

Figure 1: Radiative top production (an example) - production (A) and decay(B) diagrams, in the initial state \(q\bar{q}\) and \(gg\) are assumed; \(t,\bar{t}\) and \(\gamma\) are on mass shell.

former case it is the decay vertex which is radiatively corrected while in the latter case it is done for the production vertex.

To distinguish between the \(\gamma l\nu b\bar{b}jj\) events from radiative top production and those from radiative top decays the level of top quark virtuality can be utilised. In the radiative top production the radiating top quark is an off-mass-shell particle (high virtuality) while in radiative top decay it is an on-mass-shell particle. As it will be shown later, the virtuality criterion is an efficient means for separation of both signal processes.

**Radiative \(W\) boson decay.** In this case radiating \(W\) boson is assumed to be an on-mass-shell decay product of \(t\)-quark which decays radiatively (\(W\to l\nu\gamma\) or \(W\to jj\gamma\)). Unlike the radiative top decay case, here the photon comes from \(W\) decay products or from

Figure 2: \(pp\to t\bar{t}\gamma\), 2 gluons or \(u\bar{u}\) quark pair in initial state, for the other flavours(d,c,s,b) the same diagrams as in the case of \(u\) quark can be taken.

on-mass-shell \(W\) boson. This process is not \(Q_{top}\) sensitive, i.e. represents the background, and can be suppressed by requirement that the invariant mass \(m(jj\gamma)\) of the \(jet+jet+\gamma\) system and the transverse mass \(m_{T}(l\nu;\not{p}_{T})\) (see part 3) of the \(l\nu\gamma\) system should exceed the \(W\) boson mass. The process cross section was calculated using the matrix elements approach. In this approach it is convenient to use the approximation of zero mass of W boson decay products, but as an unwanted consequence the collinear divergence arises. To cope with the problem we required the photon to be radiated at the angle greater than a certain threshold value (\(\Delta R>0.05\)).

**Non \(t\bar{t}\) background.** An additional background in single lepton plus jets mode can originate from radiative \(W\) and \(Z\) boson production. Namely, \(W+jets\); \(Z+jets\); \(WW\) ; \(WZ\) and \(ZZ\) production processes can represent the possible sources of the background. To suppress the non-\(t\bar{t}\) background, the selection criteria for the ATLAS detector were proposed and the contribution ratios for different backgrounds were carefully calculated [8]. The analysis showed that among these processes, the main source of background is single \(W\) production, where the \(QCD\) radiation of gluons can increase the number of produced jets. The other backgrounds ( \(Z+jets+\gamma\), etc.) are expected to be suppressed at least by the factor of 10 [5, 10].

To calculate the process, the matrix elements approach based on diagrams shown in Fig.4, has been used and the problem of collinear divergence, as in the case of radiative W boson decay, has been solved by requiring \(\Delta R>0.05\) for radiated photon. Using the technique of initial and final state QCD corrections, in frame of PYTHIA, some additional jets have been added to the implemented \(W+jets+\gamma\) process [6].

The total cross sections for both \(Q_{top}\) sensitive processes and two values of the top quark charge in the region where the thresholds \(p_{T}>10\ GeV\) and \(|\eta|<3.5\) are applied to photon, are summarised in Table 1. We calculated them at the \(QCD\) scale given by the average of the squares of produced top transverse masses (\(Q^{2}=(m_{T}(t_{1})^{2}+m_{T}(t_{2})^{2})/2\)) and the \(QED\) coupling constant was taken at \(M_{Z}\).

#### 2.0.1 Calculation of the \(pp\to tt\gamma\) process

For the simulation of the processes needed for the top charge determination we have used the PYTHIA generator [6] at the particle level and the ATLFAST package [7] at the level of detector responses. A main drawback in calculating the needed processes is set by thefact that mostly they are not directly included in the PYTHIA generator. Therefore the cross sections of the processes in question should be calculated first and then incorporated into the generator. In general, the procedure of simulation of a process not included in PYTHIA will be demonstrated on the signal process for the top charge determination. The procedure consists of:

* Determination of the process cross section using the \(pp\to t\bar{t}\gamma\) amplitude (\(t,\bar{t}\) and \(\gamma\) are on-mass-shell final state particles).
* via _CALL PYUPIN_ (process definition) and _CALL PYUPEV_ (kinematics, phase space).
* Comprehension of realistic detector resolution and reconstruction of the process events by ATLFAST [7] (reconstruction of particles as seen by the ATLAS detectors).

**Cross section of the \(pp\to t\bar{t}\gamma\) process.** The process cross section calculation is carried out using the well known formula for hadron-hadron cross section, where the \(pp\) cross section is expressed through the parton ones:

\[\sigma=\sum_{(\tilde{p}_{1},\tilde{p}_{2})}\int dx_{1}dx_{2}f_{\tilde{p}_{1}}( x_{1},\mu_{F})f_{\tilde{p}_{2}}(x_{2},\mu_{F})\ d\sigma(\tilde{p}_{1}\tilde{p}_{2}\to t \bar{t}\gamma) \tag{1}\]

where \(\tilde{p}_{1}\) and \(\tilde{p}_{2}\) are initial state partons, \(f_{\tilde{p}_{1}}\) and \(f_{\tilde{p}_{2}}\) are proton structure functions taken at a factorisation scale \(\mu_{f}\) characteristic for the treated process, \(\ d\sigma\) is the differential cross section based on the matrix element of the process \(\tilde{p}_{1}\tilde{p}_{2}\to t\bar{t}\gamma\). The sum covers all possible combinations of the initial state partons.

The differential cross section of the process \(\tilde{p}_{1}\tilde{p}_{2}\to t\bar{t}\gamma\) is given by:

\[d\sigma=\frac{1}{2E_{1}2E_{2}|v_{1z}-v_{2z}|}\times|M(\tilde{p}_{1}\tilde{p} _{2}\to t\bar{t}\gamma)|^{2}\times\ dLips_{3} \tag{2}\]

where

\[dLips_{3}(P\to p_{t}+p_{\bar{t}}+p_{\gamma}) \equiv \left(\prod_{f=t,\bar{t},\gamma}\frac{d^{3}p_{f}}{(2\pi)^{3}} \frac{1}{2E_{f}}\right)\times\] \[\times (2\pi)^{4}\delta^{(4)}(p_{1}+p_{2}-p_{t}-p_{\bar{t}}-p_{\gamma})\]

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{||c|c|c||} \hline \hline total & \(pp\to t\bar{t}\gamma\), & \(pp\to t\bar{t}\), \\ cross section & \(t\to Wb\) & \(t\to Wb\gamma\) \\ \hline \(Q=2/3\) & 2.31 \(pb\) & 2.96 \(pb\) \\ \hline \(Q=-4/3\) & 7.34 \(pb\) & 1.16 \(pb\) \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 1: The total cross sections for the radiative top production and radiative top decay in the region with \(p_{T}>10\ GeV\) and \(|\eta|<3.5\). The \(QCD\) scale was set to \(Q=(m_{T}(t_{1})+m_{T}(t_{2})/2\) and the \(QED\) one to \(M_{Z}\)is the three particles phase space and \(M(\tilde{p}_{1}\tilde{p}_{2}\to t\bar{t}\gamma;\alpha_{S}(\mu_{R}))\) is the process matrix element using the strong interaction coupling constant calculated at a characteristic (renormalisation) scale of the parton process.

At the same time, the initial partons (\(\tilde{p}_{1},\ \tilde{p}_{2}\)) four momenta are:

\[p_{1}=\frac{\sqrt{s}}{2}(x_{1},x_{1},0,0)\qquad;\qquad p_{2}=\frac{\sqrt{s}}{2 }(x_{2},-x_{2},0,0) \tag{4}\]

In the final state we have three particles with momenta \(p_{t},p_{\bar{t}},p_{\gamma}\). However, a three particles phase space can be expressed through a two particles one. using the following identity [9]:

\[dLips_{n+1}(P\to q,p_{1}...p_{n}) = dLips_{n}(P-q\to p_{1}...p_{n})\times\] \[\times dM_{1}^{2}\left[\ d\cos\theta\ d\varphi\frac{1}{8(2\pi)^{3}} \frac{\lambda^{1/2}(M^{2},M_{1}^{2},m^{2})}{M^{2}}\right]\]

where \(M\) is the invariant mass of the \(n+1\) particle system (\(M^{2}=P^{2}\)), \(m\), \(\varphi\), \(\theta\), \(q\) are kinematic parameters of individual particles and \(M_{1}\) is the invariant mass of the \(n\)-particle system (\(M_{1}^{2}=(p_{1}...p_{n})^{2}\)).

\(\lambda\) is defined as follows:

\[\lambda(a,b,c)=a^{2}+b^{2}+c^{2}-2ab-2ac-2bc \tag{6}\]

Morover, it is convenient to introduce a new set of process variables:

\[(x_{1},x_{2},M_{t\bar{t}}^{2},\vartheta,\varphi)\rightarrow(p_{t\gamma},M_{t \bar{t}}^{2},\eta_{\gamma},\eta_{t\bar{t}},\varphi) \tag{7}\]

where \(\eta_{\gamma}\) (\(\eta_{t\bar{t}}\)) is the photon (\(t\bar{t}\) pair) pseudo-rapidity, \(p_{t\gamma}\) is the photon transverse mass and \(M_{t\bar{t}}^{2}\) is the invariant mass of the \(t\bar{t}\) system.

With the new variables the full process cross section reads:

\[\sigma=\int\ dp_{t\gamma}^{2}\ d\eta_{\gamma}\ d\eta_{t\bar{t}}\ dM_{t\bar{t}}^{2}\times\ d\sigma(p_{t\gamma},M_{t\bar{t}}^{2},\eta_{ \gamma},\eta_{t\bar{t}}) \tag{8}\]

where:

\[\begin{array}{rcl}d\sigma(p_{t\gamma},M_{t\bar{t}}^{2},\eta_{ \gamma},\eta_{t\bar{t}})&=&\sum_{(\tilde{p}_{1},\tilde{p}_{2})} \frac{1}{4sx_{1}x_{2}(2\pi)^{2}}\ dLips_{2}(P-p_{\gamma}\to p_{t}+p_{ \bar{t}})\\ &\times&\frac{p_{t\gamma}\cosh\eta_{t\bar{t}}}{2\sqrt{M_{t\bar{t}}^{2}+(p_{t \gamma}\cosh\eta_{t\bar{t}})^{2}}}|M(\tilde{p}_{1}\tilde{p}_{2}\to t \bar{t}\gamma)|^{2}\\ &\times&f_{\tilde{p}_{2}}(x_{2},Q^{2})\times f_{\tilde{p}_{1}}(x_{1},Q^{2}) \end{array} \tag{9}\]

and \(x_{1},x_{2}\) can be expressed through the new variables as follows:

\[\begin{array}{rcl}\frac{\sqrt{s}}{2}(x_{1}+x_{2})&=\sqrt{M_{t\bar{t}}^{2}+( p_{t\gamma}\cosh\eta_{t\bar{t}})^{2}}+p_{t\gamma}\cosh\eta_{\gamma}\\ \frac{\sqrt{s}}{2}(x_{1}-x_{2})&=p_{t\gamma}(\sinh\eta_{\gamma}+\sinh\eta_{t \bar{t}})\end{array} \tag{10}\]The main advantage of the new variables is the possibility to directly refer to the photon phase space. In such a way we can avoid the infrared divergence problem in matrix elements. The process phase space boundaries are determined by:

\[\begin{array}{l}M_{t\bar{t}}\in\langle 2m_{t}\;;\;\sqrt{s}\rangle\quad\eta_{ \gamma}\in\langle-\infty\;;\;\infty\rangle\quad p_{t\gamma}\in\langle 0\;;\; \frac{s-M_{t\bar{t}}}{2\cosh\eta_{\gamma}}\rangle\\ \\ \sinh\eta_{t\bar{t}}\in\langle\frac{-\sqrt{s}}{2p_{t\gamma}}(1-\frac{m}{\sqrt{s }})-\sinh\eta_{\gamma}\;;\;\frac{+\sqrt{s}}{2p_{t\gamma}}(1-\frac{m}{\sqrt{s}} )-\sinh\eta_{\gamma}\rangle\end{array} \tag{11}\]

The photon phase space is restricted with regard to the ATLAS detector geometry:

\[\eta_{\gamma}\in\langle-3.5,3.5\rangle\;\;\;;\;\;p_{t\gamma}>10\;GeV \tag{12}\]

#### 2.0.2 Detector response and event reconstruction

A realistic evaluation of the top charge, requires not only the simulation of the signal process and the background ones at particle level, but also taking into account the realistic capabilities of the ATLAS detectors and inefficiencies of the procedure of event reconstruction. To consider a realistic case with the detector resolutions and event reconstruction efficiencies taken into consideration, we employed the ATLFAST code [7].

### Selection criteria

To separate the radiative top production process from the background ones, the following sets of cuts and conditions have been applied to the simulated events.

* General top cuts for selection of \(b\bar{b}l\nu jj\gamma\) events (**C1**): \[\begin{array}{cccc}\mbox{njets}&\geq 4&p_{T}>20\;GeV&|\eta|<2.5\\ \mbox{nbjets}&=2&p_{T}>15\;GeV&|\eta|<2.0\\ \mbox{nlep(isolated)}&=1&p_{T}>20\;GeV&|\eta|<2.5\\ \mbox{nphot(isolated)}&=1&p_{T}>30\;GeV&|\eta|<2.5\\ \mbox{$p_{T\,miss}$}&&\mbox{$p_{T}>20\;GeV$}\end{array}\]
* Conditions for W boson reconstruction via the \(W\to jj(l\nu)\) decays (**C2**): \[|m(jj)-m_{W}|\;\;<20\;GeV\;\;\wedge\;\;m_{T}(l;\mbox{$p_{T}$})<m_{W}+20\;GeV\;,\] (13) \(m(jj)\) is the jet-jet invariant mass with the minimal deviation from the W boson mass.
* Virtuality of the top quark for selection of the radiative top production process (**C3**): \[m(bjj\gamma)>190\qquad;\qquad m_{T}(bl\gamma;\mbox{$p_{T}$})>190\] (14)where

\[m_{T}^{2}(bl\gamma;\not{p}_{T})=\left(\sqrt{p_{T}^{2}(bl\gamma)+m^{2}(bl\gamma)}+ \not{p}_{T}\right)^{2}-\left(\vec{p}_{T}(bl\gamma)+\vec{p}_{T}\right)^{2}. \tag{15}\]

To extract the radiative top decay process instead of radiative top production one, the \(t\bar{t}\gamma\) selection criteria (C3) should be changed into the \(t\to Wb\gamma\) ones which give preference to on-mass-shell radiating top. In this case a candidate event may not satisfy the C3 criterion and at the same time the following conditions should be fulfilled:

* the \((jj\gamma)\) and \((l\gamma;\not{p}_{T})\) systems are not on \(W\) boson mass shell (\(\tilde{C}3\) ) \[m(jj\gamma)>90\ {\rm and}\ m_{T}(l\gamma;\not{p}_{T})>90\]
* radiation in top decay (C4) \[m(b_{1,2}jj\gamma)>190\ {\rm and}\ m_{T}(b_{2,1}l\gamma;\not{p}_{T})<190\qquad\mbox{(C4a)}\] or \[160<m(b_{1,2}jj\gamma)<190\ {\rm and}\ m_{T}(b_{2,1}l\gamma;\not{p}_{T})>190 \qquad\mbox{(C4b)}\]

In all cases photons and leptons are required to be isolated. The standard ATLFAST criteria have been used.

### Results

To determine the cross section of the signal radiative top quark processes 350,000 events of radiative top quark production and 200,000 ones of radiative top decay above the photon threshold \(10\ GeV\) were simulated. Except of those 200,000 events of radiative \(W\) boson decay with the same photon threshold and more than 8 million of \(t\bar{t}\) events were produced for the background studies. For cross check reasons also a sample of 2.2 million radiative non-\(t\bar{t}\) (\(W\gamma\), \(Z\gamma\)) events with \(p_{T}^{\gamma}>10\ GeV\) was simulated.

In all our calculations we have used the following set of SM input parameters: \(m_{top}=174.3\ GeV\), \(m_{b}=4.5\ GeV\), \(M_{W}=80.423\ GeV\), \(sin^{2}\theta_{W}=0.231\) and \(\alpha_{S}(M_{Z})=0.1172\). We have employed the PYTHIA 5.7[6] default parton distribution functions (CTEQ5) with the factorisation scale \(\mu_{F}=\sqrt{(p_{T}(t)^{2}+p_{T}(\bar{t})^{2})/2}\), where \(p_{T}(t)\) (\(p_{T}(\bar{t})\)) is the transverse momentum of the \(t(\bar{t})\)-quark. The renormalisation scale for the \(\alpha_{S}\)\(\alpha_{S}\) evolution is set to be the same as the factorisation scale: \(\mu_{R}=\mu_{F}\).

#### 2.2.1 Radiative top production(\(t\bar{t}\gamma\) cuts)

The statistics of the simulated events and the efficiencies of various selection criteria are summarised in Table 2. Efficiencies of the \(t\bar{t}\gamma\) cuts (criterion C3) for the radiative top production and radiative top decay are shown in Fig.5 and 6. From that it is clear that the \(t\bar{t}\gamma\) cuts are very effective in suppressing the radiative top decay processes.

The cross sections and reconstruction efficiencies for the radiative top quark production and the background processes for a top quark with charge of \(2/3\) and \(-4/3\), respectively, are summarised in Table 3 and 4. The last column of the tables contains the number of reconstructed events, for the individual processes, expected to be seen by the ATLAS experiment in \(10\ fb^{-1}\) taken at the low luminosity LHC run.

The signal process (radiative top production) and the total background are compared for both the cases in Fig.7.

A comparison of the radiative top quark production for the charges \(2/3\) and \(-4/3\) can be seen in Fig.8, where the number of events expected to be seen in the ATLAS experiment for \(10\ fb^{-1}\) is shown as a function of the photon energy. From the results we can extract the cross section ratio, \(R\), for the two top charges. The value is \(R\equiv\sigma(Q_{top}=-4/3)/\sigma(Q_{top}=2/3)=3.18\). One can expect that this value is free from many uncertainties which are believed to be cancelled in the ratio.

As can be seen from Table 7 and Table 8 the effect of the top charge in the case of the radiative top decay is just opposite to that in the radiative top production. Due to the

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{||c|c|c|c|c|c||} \hline \hline process & \(pp\to t\bar{t}\gamma\) & \(t\to Wb\gamma\) & \(W\to l\nu\gamma(jj\gamma)\) & \(t\bar{t}\) & \(W\gamma\,jets\) \\ \hline sample & \(3.5\cdot 10^{5}\) & \(2\cdot 10^{5}\) & \(2\cdot 10^{5}\) & \(6.9\cdot 10^{6}\) & \(2.1\cdot 10^{6}\) \\ \hline \hline no cut (\%) & 100 & 100 & 100 & 100 & 100 \\ \hline C1 (\%) & 0.723 & 0.423 & 0.148 & \(1.5\cdot 10^{-3}\) & \(1.2\cdot 10^{-3}\) \\ \hline C2 (\%) & 0.423 & 0.292 & 0.079 & \(0.76\cdot 10^{-3}\) & \(6.2\cdot 10^{-4}\) \\ \hline C3 (\%) & 0.338 & 0.021 & 0.013 & \(0.38\cdot 10^{-3}\) & \(4.3\cdot 10^{-4}\) \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}

destructive interference the cross section is lower in the case of the charge \(-4/3\). The value of the cross section ratio, \(R\), is in the case of radiative decay \(R=2.55\), but now in favour of the charge \(Q_{top}=2/3\).

#### 2.2.2 Radiative top decay

To select a sample of radiative top decay we have taken the events which are not satisfying the criterion \(C3\) (\(t\bar{t}\gamma\) criteria) and at the same time passing the \(C4\) criterion. The candidate events can be divided into two samples - the first one giving preference to the events with the emitted photon coming from the branch with the leptonically decaying \(W\) boson, while the second one favours the branch with the hadronic decay of the \(W\) boson. The efficiencies for the different criteria in the selection of the radiative top decay are shown for both samples in Table 5, 6. Applications of the \(Wb\gamma\) criteria for both top charge alternatives are shown in Table 7 (\(Q_{top}=2/3\)) and in Table 8 (\(Q_{top}=-4/3\)). From the tables one can see that the \(Wb\gamma\) criteria give preference to the radiative top decay events but the background from

competitive processes is high.

A summary comparison of the signal process and the backgrounds is done in Table 9 for both \(t\)-quark charges. In Table 9 the integrated cross sections seen by the ATLAS detector are shown and compared with those of Baur et al.[4]. From where it can be seen that our results are systematically lower by the factor 3-8. From our point of view the differences are caused by the fact that in the present work the realistic detector responses (ATLFAST) and reconstruction algorithms (jet cone algorithm, b-tagging) are included, while in [4] the analysis has been carried out only at the parton level.

In this analysis, in the case of \(t\bar{t}\gamma\) cuts, the cross section of the \(t\bar{t}\gamma\) process is approximately 4.2 times smaller than that in [4]. On the other hand the cross section ratios \(\sigma_{total}(Q=-4/3)/\sigma_{total}(Q=2/3)\approx 3\) are in both this and previous analysis approximately the same. A more essential difference occurs in the case of the \(Wb\gamma\) cuts, where practically

no differences are predicted in the total signal for the two considered charge alternatives. In work [4] the cross section ratio is given instead equal to 2.

This difference suggests, that taking into account physical effects (ISR, FSR, hadronisation),the detector resolution and reconstruction algorithms are critical for any realistic cross section calculation.

Top quark charge from its decay products

In the second approach, the top quark charge has been determined through the charges of its decay products: \(W\) boson and \(b\)-quark. The charge of the \(W\) boson has been found through its leptonic decays and a special technique has been applied for determination of the \(b\)-quark (see below). For the analysis we have used two samples of \(t\bar{t}\) events:

* Di-lepton sample ( \(t\bar{t}\to WWb\bar{b}\rightarrow(l\nu)(l\nu)b\bar{b}\)), 4.9% of all \(t\bar{t}\) events
* Single lepton plus jets sample ( \(t\bar{t}\to WWb\bar{b}\rightarrow(l\nu)(jj)b\bar{b}\)), 29.6% of all \(t\bar{t}\) events

The decay of the top quark in the frame of the SM (\(t\to W^{+}b\to l^{+}\nu b\)) and in the exotic case (\(t\to W^{-}\bar{b}\to l^{-}\bar{\nu}b\)), leads to an opposite association of the lepton and \(b\)-jet coming from the same top decay ( \(l^{+}\) is associated with \(b\)-quark (\(\bar{b}\)-quark) in the SM (exotic case)). To distinguish between the two top quark charge alternatives (\(Q_{top}=2/3\) and \(Q_{top}=-4/3\) ), we should be able to distinguish between the charge of the \(b\)-jet associated with \(l^{+}\) and that associated with \(l^{-}\) on experimental level. The \(b\)-jets associated with \(l^{+}\) will be denoted as \(b\)-jets and those associated with \(l^{-}\) as \(\bar{b}\)-jets, in agreement with the SM predictions.

### Determination of the \(b\)-jet charge

There is the possibility to find a correlation between the charge of the \(b\)-quark and the hadrons coming from the \(b\)-quark hadronisation. Some experiments used this idea to measure the forward-backward asymmetry [11], [12], the \(B\)-mixing parameters [13]-[15], the electroweak mixing angle [16] or the \(CP\)-violation [17]. To this purpose, a parameter dubbed the \(b\)-jet charge can be introduced [11]:

\[Q_{bjet}=\frac{\sum_{i}^{N}q_{i}|\vec{j}\cdot\vec{p_{i}}|^{\kappa}}{\sum_{i}^{ N}|\vec{j}\cdot\vec{p_{i}}|^{\kappa}}, \tag{16}\]

where \(N\) is the number of charged particles inside the \(b\)-jet, \(q_{i}\left(\vec{p_{i}}\right)\) is the charge (momentum) of the \(i^{th}\) particle in the \(b\)-jet, \(\vec{j}\) is the \(b\)-jet direction, and \(\kappa\) is an exponent.

### Analysis at parton level

First we tried to determine the \(b\)-jet charge at parton level, i.e. the events produced by PYTHIA generator have been used without taking into account detector resolution and reconstruction efficiency. Using the PYTHIA code [6] we have generated \(t\bar{t}\) events and made particle evolution, including fragmentation of initial partons and decay of unstable particles into particles seen by detectors. We have taken the kinematic parameters of the \(b\)-quark originating in the top decay and have formed a "\(b\)-jet" from its decay products which have been in a certain cone around the \(b\)-quark direction (\(\Delta R\leq 0.2\)) and have calculated the \(b\)-charge using Eq.16.

For study of the systematics we have generated two samples of events differing by the fragmentation scheme; \(t\bar{t}\) events with the string and independent fragmentation have been produced and all \(b\)-jets from the \(top\) decay have been used in the analysis.

The results are summarised in Table 10. As shown in Fig. 9, the distributions for \(b\)-jets and \(\bar{b}\)-jets are clearly distinguishable at the parton level.

### Reconstruction of the \(b\)-charge in a realistic case

To consider a more realistic case with the detector resolutions and event reconstruction efficiencies taken into account, we have employed the ATLFAST code [7]. We used a cone algorithm for the jet reconstruction (cone size: \(\Delta R=0.4\)).

To determine the top charge we need to associate the lepton and the \(b\)-jet coming from the same top quark. In both sample of events (di-lepton and single lepton plus jets) we choose certain invariant mass criteria. We have used the fact that if the lepton and b quark originate from the same top quark, their invariant mass must be less than the mass of the

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|} \hline fragmentation scheme & type of jet & \(<Q>\) & \(<\sigma>\) \\ \hline \hline string & \(b_{jet}\) & \(-0.125\) & \(0.48\) \\  & \(\bar{b}_{jet}\) & \(0.123\) & \(0.48\) \\ \hline \hline independent & \(\dfrac{b_{jet}}{\bar{b}_{jet}}\) & \(-0.131\) & \(0.48\) \\  & \(\dfrac{b}{\bar{b}_{jet}}\) & \(0.120\) & \(0.48\) \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}

top quark (see Eq.18).

\[m^{2}_{t\to Wb} = m^{2}_{Wb}=[(E_{l}+E_{b})+E_{\nu}]^{2}-[(\vec{p}_{l}+\vec{p}_{b})+ \vec{p}_{\nu}]^{2}\] \[= [(E_{l}+E_{b})^{2}-(\vec{p}_{l}+\vec{p}_{b})^{2}]+2[(E_{l}+E_{b}) \cdot E_{\nu}-(\vec{p}_{l}+\vec{p}_{b})\cdot\vec{p}_{\nu}]\] \[\geq m^{2}_{lb}\]

If the decay products are from different top quarks, their invariant mass can exceed that of the top quark (see Fig. 10). These facts have been utilised for associating the lepton and \(b\)-jet from the same top decay in both the single lepton plus jets sample and the dilepton one.

#### 3.3.1 Single lepton plus jets sample

**Kinematic cuts.** In order to reduce the \(t\bar{t}\) background for the single lepton plus jets sample (the considered background processes: \(W\)+jets; \(Z\)+jets; \(WW\); \(WZ\); \(ZZ\)), the "standard" ATLAS kinematic selection criteria have been applied [8]:

* 1 isolated high \(p_{T}\) lepton (\(e\), \(\mu\)): \(p_{T}^{(1)}>20\;GeV\) and \(|\eta|<2.5\)
* Missing transverse energy \(E_{T}^{miss}>20\;GeV\)
* Two \(b\)-jets with \(p_{T}>40\;GeV\) and \(|\eta|<2.5\)

Figure 10: The reconstructed lepton-\(b\)-jet invariant mass spectrum for the \(t\bar{t}\) sample (ATLFAST). The solid line represents the case when lepton and \(b\)-jet are from the same top decay, the dashed one - the case when they are from different top quarks.

* In total 4 jets with \(p_{T}>40\ GeV\) and \(|\eta|<2.5\)

With these cuts a signal-to-background ratio of 65 is expected [8].

**Association of \(b\)-jet and lepton.** As can be seen from Fig. 10, if both the lepton (\(l\)) and \(b\)-quark (\(b_{i}\)) originate from the same top quark then the invariant mass \(m_{i}\equiv m(l,b_{i})\) practically always falls below a certain value that can be taken as \(m_{cr}=160\ GeV\). In accordance with this, the proposed criteria for association of lepton with \(b\)-jet require the invariant mass of a given lepton and \(b\)-jet pair, \(m(l,b_{i})\), to be less than \(m_{cr}\) and at the same time all other combinations of the treated lepton with \(b\)-jets (\(b_{j},\ j\neq i\)) should meet just opposite condition: \(m(l,b_{j})>m_{cr}\). Only in this case a lepton \(b\)-jet pair is considered to originate in the same \(top\) quark decay. Events are excluded if no clean association can be made, i.e. if the above mentioned conditions are not fulfilled.

#### 3.3.2 Di-lepton sample

**Kinematic cuts.** A similar set of selection criteria as those applied for the single lepton plus jets case can be used for the di-lepton sample [5].

* Two isolated high \(p_{T}\) leptons (\(e\), \(\mu\)): \(p_{T}^{(1)}>35\ GeV\), \(p_{T}^{(2)}>25\ GeV\) and \(|\eta|<2.5\)
* Missing transverse energy \(E_{T}^{miss}>40\ GeV\)
* At least two jets with \(p_{T}>25\ GeV\) ( 1 or 2 \(b\)-tagged) and \(|\eta|<2.5\)
* Z-boson cut \(|M^{ll}-M^{Z}|>10\ GeV\) (for \(ee\) and \(\mu\mu\) events)

These cuts are applied to suppress the background arising from Drell-Yan processes, \(Z\rightarrow\tau\tau\) decays associated with jets, \(WW\)+jets and \(b\bar{b}\) production. With these cuts a signal-to-background ratio of 10 is obtained.

**Association of \(b\)-jet and lepton.** In the case of di-lepton sample we can have events with one or two \(b\)-jets. For the one \(b\)-jet event sample the same strategy as in the single lepton plus jets case is used. It means that as associated is taken only the lepton \(b\)-jet pair with the invariant mass below \(m_{cr}\) and at the same time the invariant masses of all other lepton \(b\)-jet combinations in the treated event exceed the value of \(m_{cr}\).

In the case of two \(b\)-jets events one or two lepton \(b\)-jet pairs can be associated. Two lepton \(b\)-jet pairs are associated if for each of the event leptons there is a \(b\)-jet with which it creates the correct invariant mass (\(<m_{cr}\)) and at the same time different \(b\)-jets are associated to different leptons and as a maximum only one of the leptons can create invariant mass below \(m_{cr}\) with both event \(b\)-jets. As an example we present a case where the invariant mass of (\(l_{1}\),\(b\)-\(jet_{1}\))-pair and that of (\(l_{2}\),\(b\)-\(jet_{2}\))-pair is below \(m_{cr}\) and at the same time the invariant mass of (\(l_{1}\),\(b\)-\(jet_{2}\))-pair exceeds \(m_{cr}\):

\[(m_{11}<m_{cr})\ and\ (m_{12}>m_{cr})\ and\ (m_{22}<m_{cr})\]All other proper combinations we can get by simple permutation of lepton and \(b\)-jet indices.

One lepton \(b\)-jet pair is assumed to be associated if there is only one lepton creating the correct invariant mass with only one of \(b\)-jets and the combinations of the second lepton with \(b\)-jets give the invariant masses exceeding \(m_{cr}\). In all other cases no association is made. As an example we bring the case of (\(l_{1}\),\(b\)-\(jet_{1}\))-pair association:

\[(m_{11}<m_{cr})\ and\ (m_{12}>m_{cr})\ and\ (m_{21}>m_{cr})\ and\ (m_{22}>m_{cr})\]

As before, other correct combinations we get by appropriate permutation of lepton and \(b\)-jet indices.

### Results

In Table 11 we present the summary output statistics obtained. The analysed sample (\(480,000\) inclusive \(t\bar{t}\) events) corresponds to \(0.87\ fb^{-1}\) of integrated luminosity. The appropriate kinematic and association cuts have been applied to the sample of \(160,000\) single lepton plus jets events and \(22,200\) dilepton ones, respectively. Approximately \(2,400\) events in both samples have passed the applied cuts.

The reconstructed \(b\)-jet (\(\bar{b}\)-jet) charge distributions are shown in Fig. 11 and the final \(b\)-jet charge statistics from our \(t\bar{t}\) sample is shown in Table 12. In the third column of this table there is the mean value of the jet charge \(\langle Q\rangle\) with its statistical uncertainty \(\sigma_{\langle Q\rangle}=\sigma/\sqrt{N}\), where \(N\) is the number of \(b\)-jets in the sample charge distribution. In the fourth column there is a standard deviation \(\langle\sigma\rangle\) of the jet charge distribution and in the last one we can find the recalculated statistical uncertainty of mean charge in \(10\ fb^{-1}\) sample.

As can be seen from Table 12 the results are practically not influenced by the type of fragmentation scheme. In Fig. 12 the number of reconstructed tracks belonging to the \(b\)-jet cone (\(\Delta R<0.4\)) is shown for both the fragmentation options.

To evaluate the level of separation between mean \(b\)-jet and \(\bar{b}\)-jet charges a separation factor \(\alpha\) has been introduced:

\[\alpha\equiv\frac{|Q_{b-jet}-Q_{\bar{b}-jet}|}{\sigma_{\langle Q\rangle}}= \frac{|Q_{b-jet}-Q_{\bar{b}-jet}|\sqrt{N}}{\sigma}. \tag{18}\]

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|} \hline Total number & \multicolumn{2}{c|}{48000} \\ \cline{2-3} of inclusive \(t\bar{t}\) events & 1 lepton + jets & di-lepton \\ \hline \hline decay mode & 161 200 & 22 240 \\ \hline after kinematic cuts & 7 360 & 15 500 \\ \hline after association & 2 375 & 1 700 \\ \hline \(N_{track}\geq 1\) & & \\ \(b_{jet}\) & 1 200 & 1 210 \\ \(\bar{b}_{jet}\) & 1 190 & 1 210 \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 11: Statistics for the single lepton plus jets events and dilepton ones.

To get a \(5\sigma\) separation of \(b\)-jet from \(\bar{b}\)-jet we need to have \(\approx 63\) events from both charge distributions, which corresponds to \(12,800\) inclusive \(t\bar{t}\) events or \(24\)\(pb^{-1}\) of integrated luminosity at LHC.

## 4 Conclusions

We have studied the prospects of the top charge determination in the ATLAS experiment using two different methods. The first method is based on the measurement of the cross section of radiative \(top\) production (\(t\bar{t}\gamma\) process), in the second method the top charge is determined by the charge of its decay product using the charge conservation law.

**The top quark charge from radiative processes.** Analysing this option we have assumed that both \(b-\)quarks are tagged. The study is carried out at the tree level and makes

use of both \(t\bar{t}\gamma\) production and radiative. Top quark decays and top quark and \(W\) boson decays are treated in the narrow width approximation. The event samples corresponding to both signal processes are retrieved by simple phase space cuts.

Since gluon fusion dominates \(t\bar{t}\gamma\) production at the LHC, the process cross section is roughly proportional to \(Q_{top}^{2}\). The cross section seen by the ATLAS experiment in one LHC year (\(10fb^{-1}\)) is more than 3-times higher for the exotic charge (\(Q_{top}=-4/3\)) than for the SM one (\(Q_{top}=2/3\)). In one LHC year we expect to see in the SM case approximately 80 events with the background of 73 events while in the case quark it should be 250 signal events at the background of 70 events.

In the phase space region dominated by radiative top decays, due to interference between diagrams with a photon being radiated from the top quark, the \(W\) boson and the \(b\)-quark, the cross section for \(Q_{top}=2/3\) (positive sign of interference) is expected to be higher than that for \(Q_{top}=-2/3\) (negative sign of interference). But in this case the situation is less favourable than in the previous one concerning the background. Here we expect to see in one year 70 events of signal and 86 background events for \(Q_{top}=2/3\) and

27 signal events against 140 background ones for \(Q_{top}=-4/3\).

Therefore, we are justified to state that using radiative \(t\bar{t}\) events in the ATLAS experiment we will be able to distinguish between the top charge \(2/3\) and \(-4/3\) by direct measuring the photon coupling to the top quark in 10 \(fb^{-1}\) sample of events (one LHC low luminosity year).

It should be stressed that the main source of systematics in our calculations comes from the uncertainty on the QCD scale. Varying this scale from \(Q^{2}=(m_{top}/2)^{2}\) to \(Q^{2}=(2m_{top})^{2}\) the cross sections for \(t\bar{t}\) production can change by \(\sim 30\%\)[5], but it is believed that this uncertainty is absent in the cross section ratios.

**The top quark charge from its decay products.** In this approach we explored the possibility to determine the top charge using the information of the lepton and \(b\)-jet charge from \(t\bar{t}\) events. The events were simulated using the PYTHIA generator (version 5.7) and the ATLAS detector response was obtained using ATLFAST package.

The analysis carried out on the sample equivalent to a fraction of 7% of the one year production of \(t\bar{t}\) events at LHC leads to the following conclusions:

* The ATLAS experiment will be able to associate lepton and \(b\)-jet from the same top decay
* \(24\;pb^{-1}\) of integrated luminosity will be sufficient for the \(b\)-jet charge determination (at \(5\sigma\) separation level ).
* From the previous items follow that if lepton and \(b\)-jet have opposite signs, this will constrain the \(SM\) top charge of \(Q=-2/3\), while the same one will allow non \(SM\) interpretation of observed top quark.

It should be noted that in this case (top quark charge from its decay products), a more careful analysis of background and systematics is needed. For the background study it would be desirable to investigate the events with more than two partons involved in the hard \(pp\) collision (underlying events) and for the purposes of systematics an analysis with a sample of fully simulated events should be carried out.
