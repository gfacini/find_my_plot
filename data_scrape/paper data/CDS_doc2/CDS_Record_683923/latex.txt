###### Abstract

Multiscale technicolor models predict the existence of high mass resonances at hadron colliders. Although the quark fusion process of production dominates, vector boson fusion offers the advantage of allowing forward jet tagging for background suppression. We calculate here the cross section and differential distributions for \(\rho_{T}\) production, in the vector boson fusion channel and evaluate the possibility of observation.

November 5, 1999Introduction

In the search for the origin of electroweak symmetry breaking, strong coupling models are an alternative to the Standard Model Higgs mechanism, or for weakly coupled theories based on supersymmetry. Although classical technicolor[1] suffers from major shortcomings, viable multiscale models have been developed [2] which allow for fermion mass generation and for the absence of weak neutral currents. These models, which are not necessarily excluded by precision measurements of electroweak parameters at LEP and SLC [3], not only provide the technipions which serve as the longitudinal components of the gauge bosons, but also predict the existence of technipions \((\pi_{T})\) as mass eigenstates, as well as technirhos \((\rho_{T})\), and other techniparticles.

A separate note [4] has evaluated the feasibility of observing such resonances in ATLAS. The analysis was based on a PYTHIA implementation of the multiscale model of Eichten Lane and Womersley [2], and took into account detector effects by using a fast simulation of the ATLAS detector [5]. In particular, one of the channels analyzed was \(\rho_{T}^{\pm}\) production with subsequent decay into \(\pi_{T}^{0}W_{L}^{\pm}\to b\overline{b}\ell^{\pm}\nu\). Assuming a quark fusion process, the authors [2] of the model have calculated the relevant matrix elements. It has then been shown in [4] that, given some reasonable values for the parameters of the model, the observation of such a process should be feasible with ATLAS, but is limited by background for possible large masses of \(\rho_{T}\) and \(\pi_{T}\).

The technique of forward jet tagging has been shown [6] to be very powerful in eliminating backgrounds from such processes as \(W\) + jets production. For that reason, it is important to estimate if \(\rho_{T}\) production via a vector boson fusion process can be a useful complementary channel for discovery of such a resonance. We evaluate here the cross section for this process and show, for the typical case mentioned above, how the signal can be extracted from the backgrounds.

The article is organized as follows. First, the model for the form factor and decay width of \(\rho_{T}\) are presented in section 2. Results on the cross section calculation are given in section 3. The analysis of a simulated sample of signal and background events is then performed in section 4. The main results are summarized in the conclusion.

Model

In this section we describe in detail the essential features of the model used in our calculations.

The lighter isotriplet \(\rho_{T}\) is assumed to decay dominantly into pairs of the mixed state of isotriplet \(\left|\Pi_{T}\right\rangle=\sin\chi\left|W_{L}\right\rangle+\cos\chi\left|\pi_{ T}\right\rangle\), where the value of the mixing angle \(\chi\) is assumed [2] to be: \(\sin\chi=1/3\). The vertex \(\rho_{T}\rightarrow\pi_{A}\pi_{B}\), where \(\pi_{A,B}\) may be longitudinal \(W_{L}^{\pm},Z_{L}\) bosons or technipion \(\pi_{T}\), has the following form [2]:

\[g_{\rho}\,F_{\rho\pi\pi}(p,q_{A},q_{B})C_{AB}\,\varepsilon^{\nu}(q_{A}-q_{B})_ {\nu} \tag{1}\]

where \(p\), \(q_{A}\) and \(q_{B}\) are the momenta of \(\rho_{T}\), \(\pi_{A}\) and \(\pi_{B}\); \(\varepsilon^{\nu}\) is the polarization vector of \(\rho_{T}\); the parameters \(C_{AB}\) are equal to

\[C_{AB}\,=\,\left\{\begin{array}{ll}\sin^{2}\chi&\mbox{for}\quad W_{L}^{\pm }\ Z_{L},\\ \sin\chi\,\cos\chi&\mbox{for}\quad W_{L}^{\pm}\ \pi_{T},\\ \cos^{2}\chi&\mbox{for}\quad\pi_{T}\ \pi_{T}\end{array}\right. \tag{2}\]

and \(g_{\rho}\) is a coupling constant, normalized as follows [2]:

\[\frac{g_{\rho}^{2}}{4\pi}\,=\,2.91\left(\frac{3}{N_{T\,C}}\right),\]

where \(N_{T\,C}=4\) (see [2]).

Being a compound object, consisting of two heavy techniquarks, the technirho couples to two technipions (or longitudinal \(W,Z\) bosons) by means of the diagram in Fig.1. In the loop the techniquarks 1 and 2 are on-shell (it is a typical approximation for a such consideration), while quark 3 is virtual. The latter has a momentum \(p_{3}\) given by:

\[p_{3}\,=\,p_{1}-q_{A}\,=\,\frac{1}{2}p_{\rho}-q_{A}\,=\,\frac{1}{2}(q_{B}-q_{ A}).\]

The production vertex, is naturally suppressed by large virtualities of the \(W_{L}\) and \(Z_{L}\), but is enhanced, in that case, by large values of \(p_{3}\) in the numerator. To be consistent with the Effective W Approximation (EWA), the additional form factor \(F_{\rho\pi\pi}(p,q_{A},q_{B})\) in (1) is introduced.

\[F_{\rho\pi\pi}(p,q_{A},q_{B})\,=\,\frac{M_{\rho}^{2}-M_{\pi_{A}}^{2}-M_{\pi_{ B}}^{2}}{2(q_{A}q_{B})}, \tag{3}\]where \(M_{\rho},M_{\pi_{A,B}}\) are the masses of \(\rho_{T},\pi_{A,B}\). In analogy with the case of a heavy \((Q_{1}\bar{Q}_{2})\)-meson, this form-factor takes into account the possible off-shellness of technipions \(\pi_{A}\) and \(\pi_{B}\). The denominator in the effective \(\rho_{T}\pi_{A}\pi_{B}\) vertex (3) results from the propagator of this virtual quark in the loop:

\[m_{3}^{2}-p_{3}^{2}=\frac{M_{\rho}^{2}}{4}-\frac{(q_{B}-q_{A})^{2}}{4}=(q_{A}q _{B}), \tag{4}\]

where \(M_{\rho}^{2}=q_{A}^{2}+q_{B}^{2}+2(q_{A}q_{B})\).

In the decay vertex of \(\rho_{T}\), for on-shell technipions \(\pi_{A}\) and \(\pi_{B}\), we have \(F_{\rho\pi\pi}|_{\rm on-shell}=1\).

Using the vertex (1) we get the well-known equation for the \(\rho_{T}\to\pi_{A}\pi_{B}\) decay width [2]:

\[\Gamma(\rho_{T}\to\pi_{A}\pi_{B})=\frac{2\alpha_{\rho_{T}}C_{AB}^{2}}{3}\frac {p_{AB}^{3}}{M_{\rho}^{2}} \tag{5}\]

We investigate the case of \(\rho_{T}^{\pm}\) production with its subsequent decay into \(\pi_{T}^{0}W_{L}^{\pm}\) pair. The corresponding branching ratio has a non-trivial behavior, as can be seen in Fig. 2 for three decay channels of the charged technirho: \(\rho_{T}^{\pm}\to\pi_{T}^{0}\pi_{T}^{\pm}\), \(\rho_{T}^{\pm}\to\pi_{T}^{0}W_{L}+\pi_{T}^{\pm}Z_{L}\) or \(\rho_{T}^{\pm}\to Z_{L}W_{L}^{\pm}\).

We can distinguish two regions in thetechnipion to technirho mass ratio. In the first region, namely \(M_{\pi_{T}}/M_{\rho_{T}}\leq 1/2\), the \(\rho_{T}^{\pm}\rightarrow\pi_{T}\pi_{T}\) decay is kinematically allowed. As \(M_{\pi_{T}}\) increases (keeping \(M_{\rho_{T}}\) fixed) the relative momentum \(p_{AB}\) in equation (5) decreases. As a result we have a decreasing branching fraction for the \(\pi_{T}\pi_{T}\) channel, while the other two channels increase in their relative value (see Fig. 2). Just above the value \(M_{\pi_{T}}/M_{\rho_{T}}=1/2\) the branching ratio for the \(\pi_{T}W_{L}\) channel reaches its maximum value. As the mass of \(\pi_{T}\) rises further, in the second region up to the kinematic bound \(M_{\pi_{T}}/M_{\rho_{T}}=1\), the relative boson momentum \(p_{W\pi_{T}}\) decreases, yielding a decreasing branching ratio for technipion + longitudinal \(W\) boson.

Calculation of the cross section

We examine the reaction of technirho production at \(\sqrt{s}=14\) TeV (LHC collider) with subsequent decay of the technirho into a neutral technipion \(\pi^{0}_{T}\) and a longitudinal \(W^{\pm}_{L}\)-boson

\[pp\to q_{f}q_{f}\rho_{T}\,(\to\pi^{0}_{T}W_{L})\,X \tag{6}\]

Since each of the final particles from the \(\rho_{T}\) decay has a very narrow width in comparison with its mass, we take both the final \(W_{L}\)-boson and technipion to be on-shell.

One of the diagrams describing the subprocess

\[qq^{\prime}\to q_{f}q^{\prime}_{f}\rho_{T}\to q_{f}q^{\prime}_{f}\pi^{0}_{T}W_ {L} \tag{7}\]

is shown in Fig. 3. Only fusion of longitudinal \(W_{L}\) and \(Z_{L}\) bosons, radiated from the initial quarks \(q\) and \(q^{\prime}\), needs to be taken into account.

The polarization vector of a longitudinal boson with mass \(M\) and 4-momentum \(q\) is equal to [7];

\[e^{\nu}=\frac{q^{\nu}}{M}+\frac{(q_{0}-|\vec{q}|)}{M}(-1,\vec{q}/|\vec{q}|). \tag{8}\]In our calculations we set that

\[{\rm BR}(\pi_{T}^{0}\to b\bar{b})=1,\] \[{\rm and}\qquad{\rm BR}(W_{L}^{\pm}\to l^{\pm}\nu)=1/9.\]

We use the CTEQ2L parameterization of the proton structure functions [8]. For evolution scale we set \(\sqrt{Q^{2}}=M_{W}\).

The resulting cross sections for different values of the masses of \(\rho_{T}^{\pm}\) and \(\pi_{T}^{0}\) are presented in the Table 1. Note, that the cross section of the reaction (6) may be presented in the factorized form as follows:

\[\sigma(pp\to q_{f}q_{f}\rho_{T}(\to\pi_{T}^{0}W_{L})X)=\sigma(pp\to q_{f}q_{f} \rho_{T}X)\times{\rm BR}(\rho_{T}\to\pi_{T}^{0}W_{L}). \tag{9}\]

Therefore, the \(M_{\pi_{T}}\)-dependence of the cross section for reaction (6) with a given value of \(M_{\rho_{T}}\) is completely determined by the branching ratio of techniho decay into \(\pi_{T}W_{L}\) (see Fig. 2). In particular, we expect that the cross section of reaction (6) should reach a maximum for \(M_{\pi_{T}}/M_{\rho_{T}}\approx 1/2\).

A brief remark about the role of the form-factor \(F_{\rho\pi\pi}\) in the \(\rho_{T}\pi_{A}\pi_{B}\) vertex \((1)\) is in order. In Fig. 4 comparison is made of the pseudorapidity distribution of the final primary light quarks \(q_{f},q_{f}^{{}^{\prime}}\) (not from \(\pi_{T}^{0}\) decay). The dashed histogram corresponds to the \(q_{W}\) and \(q_{Z}\) dependent form-factor \(F_{\rho\pi\pi}\) using expression (3), while the solid histogram is produced with \(F_{\rho\pi\pi}=1\). From this figure one clearly sees that the latter choice \((F=1)\) disagrees with expectations from the effective \(W\)-approximation, since the pseudorapidity distribution of the final \(q_{f}\) do not peak in the forward and backward direction).

Other differential distributions are shown in the Figs. 5-7 (solid histograms).

We also compare our exact results with the calculations within effective \(W\)-approximation approach [7]. In this case the matrix element for the process

\[W_{L}\ Z_{L}\ \to\rho_{T}\ \to\pi_{T}\,W_{L}\]

looks very simple. The exact form of the \(|M|^{2}\) is presented below

\[|M|^{2} \propto C_{WZ}^{\ 2}C_{\pi W}^{\ 2}\left(\frac{(p_{w}^{2}-p_{z}^{2})(p_{a} ^{2}-p_{a}^{2})}{M_{\rho_{T}}^{2}}-(p_{w}-p_{z})(p_{a}-p_{b})\right)^{2}\] \[\times\frac{1}{(P_{\rho_{T}}^{\ 2}-M_{\rho_{T}}^{\ 2})^{2}+(\Gamma_{\rho_{T}}M_{\rho_{T}})^{2}},\]where \(p_{w}\) and \(p_{z}\) are the momenta of the initial \(W_{L}\) and \(Z_{L}\), while \(p_{a}\) and \(p_{b}\) are the momenta of the final longitudinal \(W_{L}\) boson and techipion \(\pi_{T}\), respectively (see [9], for detail). The parameters \(C_{WZ}\) and \(C_{\pi W}\) are given by the equation (2).

The corresponding differential distributions are shown in the Figs. 5-6 (dashed histograms). One can see from these figures that the shapes from the exact and EWA calculations are in good agreement.

## 4 Observability of \(qq\to qq\rho_{T}^{\pm}\to qqW^{\pm}\pi_{T}^{0}\)

As an example for the above calculation, the same case as in [4] is considered here: \(\rho_{T}^{\pm}\to qqW^{\pm}\pi_{T}^{0}\to l\nu b\bar{b}\) (where \(l\) to be electron or muon), with \(m_{\rho_{T}}\) = 800 GeV and \(m_{\pi_{T}}\) = 500 GeV. For this process, \(\sigma\times BR\) is about 2.2 fb, as can be seen from table 1 (accounting for both \(\mu\nu\) and \(e\nu\) decays of the charged \(W\). This cross section depends sensitively on the assumed value of the mixing \(\sin\chi\) between the longitudinal gauge bosons and the technipions since it involves the \(WZ\rho_{T}\) vertex as well as the \(\rho_{T}W\pi_{T}\) vertex.

The process was implemented in PYTHIA in order to generate sample Monte Carlo events, with ATLFAST simulation of the detector. The same background samples as in [4] are used: \(W\) + jets, \(Wb\bar{b}\), according to a code obtained from [10] and implemented in HERWIG [11], \(t\bar{t}\), Z+jets, and \(WZ\) continuum. Table 2 shows the samples used in this analysis.

The following cuts were applied on signal and backgrounds:

* The presence of at least one lepton of \(p_{T}>20\) GeV and of two reconstructed b-jets of \(p_{T}>50\) GeV is required in the central region \(|\eta|<2\). The missing transverse energy must be greater than 20 GeV.
* Since the \(\rho_{T}\) is colour neutral, a central jet veto (\(|\eta|<2\) and threshold = 30 GeV) helps reject the \(t\bar{t}\) background.
* A forward and a backward jet are required, with \(p_{T}>80\) GeV in the region \(1.5<|\eta|<3.5\) for the first jet, and \(p_{T}>50\) GeV in the region \(1<|\eta|<4\) for the second jet.

The effects of the cuts on the signal and backgrounds are shown in table 3. As in the case of \(qq\) fusion, the \(t\bar{t}\) background dominates. The W+jets and Z+jets (as well as \(Wb\bar{b}\)) backgrounds are negligible. Because of forward jet tagging, a simpler set of cuts was sufficient. Given a \(\sigma\times BR\) of only 2.2 fb, the resulting signal would leave about 2.6 events on a background of about 5.6 for an integrated luminosity of 30 fb\({}^{-1}\), or a value of \(\sigma/\sqrt{B}=1.1\). This is to be compared with a significance of 2.1 obtained in ref [4]. This process of vector boson fusion with forward tagging of jets could therefore complement the \(q\bar{q}\) fusion process, but would not be a discovery channel unless the \(\sigma\times BR\) is at least 12 fb.

## 5 Conclusion

We have calculated the cross section and differential distributions for \(\rho_{T}\) production, in the vector boson fusion channel. We have compared our exact calculations with those within the effective W-boson approximation. The shapes of the differential distributions for the final particles (charged leptons and \(b\)-quarks) obtained by the two methods (the exact and EWA) are in reasonable agreement.

We have implemented our process in PYTHIA with ATLFAST simulation of the detector.

For a particular choice for the masses of thechnirho and technipion (\(M_{\rho_{T}}=800\) GeV and \(M_{\pi_{T}}=500\) Gev) we have examined the possibility of extracting the signal from the background. After applications of the corresponding kinematical cuts for the low luminosity option we would expect about 2.6 events from the signal and about 5.6 ones from the background. Therefore, the process of vector boson fusion with forward tagging of jets could complement the \(q\bar{q}\) fusion process.
