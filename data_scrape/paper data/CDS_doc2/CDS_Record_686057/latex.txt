Abstract

A numerical prediction of the operation of the ATLAS barrel silicon microstrip detector is done with three scenarios of applied voltage on the detector. These scenarios approximately correspond to the operation of p-on-n and n-on-n detectors. Various operational parameters are examined to see the effective operation period of the system.

## 1 Input parameters.

### Fluence

The neutron equivalent fluence listed in ATLAS ID-TDR p.394 is used [1]. Low luminosity operation at \(10^{33}\)cm\({}^{-2}\)s-1 is assumed for the first three years, then operation at L=\(10^{34}\) cm\({}^{-2}\)s-1 follows in subsequent years. Total fluxes for initial ten years are listed in Table 1.

Fig.1 shows the integrated fluence as a function of operating year.

Figure 1: Integrated neutron equivalent fluence [1]. 50% more case (\(\times\)1.5 fluence) is shown for r=300 mm. Shade indicates operation periods.

### Access scenario

The temperature of the detector plays an important role. It is assumed to approximately follows the standard access scenario (SAP) proposed in the TDR [1]:

\begin{tabular}{l c c c c c c} \hline \hline Number of days & 100 & 100 & 2 & 14 & 149 & days \\ Detector status & operation & off & access & maintenance & off & \\ Temperature of detector & \(\sim\) -7 & - 7 & + 20 & + 17 & - 7 & 'C \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}

### Detector annealing parameters

Parameters for the long term behavior of the silicon detector are taken from the TDR Table 11-5 (p 402) [1, 2]. Although the short term beneficial annealing is neglected in TDR, it is maintained in the present calculation since its effect on the depletion voltage is not negligible during the period of detector operation [3]. The formula used for the change of depletion voltage are

\[V(dep)=\frac{e\cdot d^{2}\cdot\left|N_{eff}\right|}{2\pi e_{0}}\,,\]

\[N_{eff}=N_{eff}\,^{-}N_{C0}(1-e^{-\Phi})-g_{S}e^{-t/\tau(T)}-g_{C}\Phi-g_{Y} \Phi\Big{(}1-\frac{1}{1+k_{0}\texttt{exp}(-E_{a}/k_{B}T)\cdot g_{Y}\Phi\cdot t }\Big{)}\,,\]

\[\tau(T)=\tau_{0}\texttt{exp}(-0.175T[^{\circ}C])\,,\]

where \(N_{eff0}=5\times 10^{11}/cm^{3}\,,\) \(\texttt{e}^{-}=11\), \(\texttt{t}\)

\[N_{C0}=1.96\times 10^{11}/cm^{3}\,,\] \[g_{S}=0.019\texttt{cm}\,,\] \[\tau_{0}=70\texttt{~{}day},\] \[k_{0}=52\texttt{~{}cm}^{3}s^{-1}\,,\]

\[E_{a}=1.3\texttt{keV},\]

T is the detector temperature, d is the detector thickness, t is the elapsed time, and \(\Phi\) is the integrated neutron-equivalent fluence.

### Bulk leak current

C. Buttar and J. Carter [4] recently measured the bulk leakage current of both p-in-n and n-in-n detectors irradiated to 3 x10\({}^{14}\) protons/ cm\({}^{2}\), which approximately corresponds to 2 x10\({}^{14}\) n\({}_{\text{eq}}\)/cm\({}^{2}\) ;

V(apply) & 300 & 400 & 500 & V \\ I(leak) at 0\({}^{\circ}\)C & 1346 & 1507 & 1777 & \(\mu\)A \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular} Figure 2 show the data and its polynomial fit which is used in the calculation. The current is assumed to be proportional to the integrated fluence \(\Phi\). The actual leakage current depends on the detector temperature;

\[i\propto T^{2}\exp(-E_{g}/2k_{B}T)\,,\]

where E\({}_{g}\) is set to 1.23 eV.

## 2 Scenarios of the applied voltage

In order to calculate the yearly performance of the detector, one has to determine the strategy of the applied voltage on silicon detectors. Three cases are assumed;

case-A: V(apply) \(\geq\) V(dep), case-B (p-on-n): V(apply) = V(dep) + 100 V, case-C (n-on-n): V(apply) \(\geq\) V(dep) but V(apply) \(\leq\) 300 V,

where V(dep) is the predicted depletion voltage at the end of each yearly operation period. The applied voltage V(apply) is kept constant throughout each operation. When V(dep) is less than 100V, the minimum applied voltage is set to 100 V for all scenarios. The

Case-B approximately corresponds to the voltage scenario for the p-on-n detectors, while case-C may be close to that for n-on-n detectors. Additional 100 V in the case-B includes possible spread of depletion voltage prediction of irradiated detectors. The limit 300 V is chosen for case-C conservatively for safe operation [5].

## 3 Calculation

The present numerical calculation is done in following way;

1. Calculate the integrated fluence \(\Phi\) as a function of operating year.
2. Calculate the depletion voltage V(dep) by taking the time dependence of the detector temperature into account.
3. Set the applied voltage V(apply) according to the rules for each scenario. The predicted V(dep) at the end of the coming run is used in determining the applied voltage.
4. Estimate the bulk leak current at 0\({}^{\circ}\)C using the polynomial fit to the measured voltage dependence of the leak current (see Section 1.4). Then the bulk heat generation q(Si)\({}_{0}\) at 0\({}^{\circ}\)C is calculated by multiplying the applied voltage and the leak current.
5. The various operational parameters, temperature T, total bulk heat, total bulk current and maximum strip current, are calculated from the value of q(Si)\({}_{0}\) using the polynomial fits to the thermal simulation results (see Section 1.6).

## 4 Yearly profiles and detector life

### Depletion voltage

shows the summary of predicted depletion voltage for the cases of nominal and 1.5 X fluence and also for both -10\({}^{\circ}\)C and -15\({}^{\circ}\)C. One sees there is little dependence on cooling contact temperature T(cool), while both fluence and radius dependences are quite large.

The reason of small T(cool) dependence can be understood that T-dependent anti-annealing effect are small during detector operation as shown in Figure 7. One can clearly see that most of the anti-annealing effects comes from the access period (2 days at 20\({}^{\circ}\)C and 14 days at

Figure 7: Depletion voltage due to the anti-annealing term for-10\({}^{\circ}\)C and -15\({}^{\circ}\)C at 1.5 X flux and r=300 mm. Shaded area corresponds to detector operation.

In the calculation of the depletion voltage, the second-order effect of operating detector temperature, namely non-uniform temperature distribution over silicon detector may create non-uniform depletion voltage. But it turned out small (less than 10 V) as long as detector temperature are near or below -5\({}^{\circ}\)C. This is consistent with the observation shown in Figure 7.

### Life of the detector unit

Now we are going to apply two operation limits to these yearly profile to get operation periods. The criteria used to determine the operation life are

V-limit : \[\text{V(apply)}\leq 500\ \text{V}\ \text{for Cases A and B, V(apply)/V(dep)}\geq 0.70\ \text{for Case C,}\] T-limit : \[\text{Temperature of the left-top corner}\leq 0^{\circ}\text{C}.\]

These two limits are regarded as "critical" limits on detector operation, while other operational parameters such as total heat generation (Qsi), total leak current (Isi) and strip current (Istrip) are considered to be not fatal in the detector operation in this study.

The maximum applied voltage is set at 500 V since there are little experience of operation above this value. In addition, the bulk leakage current seems to rise rapidly at around 500 V as indicated in Figure 2. For Case-C (n-on-n), the ratio V(apply)/V(dep) is required to be above 0.70 for decent charge collection. It is set to 0.70 instead of 0.5 to absorb the uncertainty in the V(dep) prediction (just like Case-B in which V(apply) is set to 100 V above V(dep) to accommodate the possible V(dep) uncertainty).

The T-limit (temperature limit) is set to 0\({}^{\circ}\)C because all the temperature profiles as a function of year show fairly rapid increases to thermal runaway points once it reaches at 0\({}^{\circ}\)C.

Table 3 is the summary of the operational years (=life) of the detector unit obtained by applying the above operational criteria. In the table, for example, life "12 E" means the corresponding criterion is violated in between 12-th and 13-th operational year. life "11.5" indicates the criterion is violated during the 11-th year operation. Two lives (V-limit life and T-limit life) are shown in each case.

There remain some warnings about the detector operation as high as 500 V. To evaluate the dependence on V-limit, it is changed from 300 to 500 V for the case-B (p-on-n) as shown in Table 4. Roughly speaking, each 100 V increase in V-limit extends the detector life by one or two years. It is also noted that there is very little dependence on the cooling temperature 110\({}^{\circ}\)C or -15\({}^{\circ}\).

## 5 Points of observation

1. The depletion voltage increases non-linearly due to the increasing contribution by the anti-annealing term in later years [Figures 7 and 8].
2. The evolution of depletion voltage shows little difference for two cooling (actually contact) temperatures T(cool) of -10\({}^{\circ}\)C and -15\({}^{\circ}\)C [Figure 8]. This is because almost all the anti-annealing part is increased by the warm-up during the access periods [Figure 7].
3. Two fluence scenarios (nominal and 1.5 X nominal) generate a large difference in deple

tion voltage prediction [Figure 8]. For example, at r=300mm and after 10-th year operation, the predicted depletion voltage is ~200 V for nominal fluence as opposed to ~400 V for 1.5 X nominal one.
4. The yearly profile of detector temperature shows rather flat and stable behavior except last one or two years before its catastrophic end of thermal runaway [Figures 10 and 11]. This somewhat unexpected profile can be qualitatively explained by the multiplicative combination of three evolutions: (1) non-linear growth of depletion voltage (and applied voltage), (2) increase of leakage current as applied voltage [Figure 2], and (3) non-linear response of detector temperature [Figure 5].
5. The operation life of the detector unit is in general determined by the voltage limit (V-limit) rather than the thermal limit (T-limit) [Table 3]. Especially in Case-C (n-on-n like), the voltage limit R\({}_{\rm V}\geq 0.70\) is violated many years before the year of thermal limit. This is a natural consequence of its restriction of V(apply) \(\leq 300\) V. In Case-A and -B (p-on-n like), however, the thermal and voltage limits occur in the similar year range. Thus one can empirically say "500V limit \(\sim\) thermal limit" for the module type nose.
6. Thermally stronger module type "coverall" extends the thermal-limit life by one year [Table 3]. One can also extend the thermal life one more year by lowering the cooling temperature from -10\({}^{\circ}\)C to -15\({}^{\circ}\)C [Table 3].
7. The life strongly depends on the detector radius. There are generally two-year differences between the lives of ring-1 (r=300 mm) and ring-2 (373 mm), and one year step each beyond [Table 3 & Figure 12]. So the ring-1 dominates the life of the detector system.
8. The value of V-limit strongly affects the overall life of the detector unit. The limit change from 500 V to 300 V will shorten the life by about 3 years in Case-B (p-on-n like) [Table 4 & Figure 12]. Therefore the capability of HV operation up to 500 V is important for long life.

## 9 Optimization

Based on the several points listed above, it becomes clear that the voltage to be applied on detectors is the main and key limiting factor for the life of detector operation. In the case of p-on-n detectors, the strong dependence of the life on the maximum applied voltage indicates a need of stable operation in the range of 300 to 500 V.

If the stable operation of such a HV range is not guaranteed, it is recommended to use n-on-n type detectors for long life of operation. The strong dependence of life on the detector radius suggests that a optimum solution for longest possible life of the system operation is

* to use n-on-n type for inner one or two rings, and
* to employ p-on-n detectors in outer regions of radius.

This combination avoids the detector operation at higher voltage range near 500 V, while it extends the operation life at smaller radii.

For example, if 400 V operation is reachable as a reasonable guess, the operational life of the combination of n-on-n for ring-1 and p-on-n for rings 2-4 will be 10, 10,11 and 12 years for rings 1,2,3 and 4, respectively, even for the case of 1.5 X nominal fluence case (see Figure 12).

Operation at lower temperature or use of thermally stronger module type will extend the life by another one or two (but not more) years. Application of these improvements on inner rings is also recommended.

## 10 Summary

The operation of the ATLAS barrel silicon microstrip detector is predicted under the various external conditions;

* nominal fluence and1.5 X minimal fluence,
* detector locations at r = 300, 373, 447 and 520 mm,
* cooling contact temperature at -10\({}^{\circ}\)C ans -15\({}^{\circ}\)C,
* two barrel module types "nose" and "coverall",
* standard access scenario of 2 days at 20\({}^{\circ}\)C and 14 days at 17\({}^{\circ}\)C,
* three scenarios of the applied voltage V(apply); case-A: V(apply) \(\geq\) V(dep), case-B (p-on-n): V(apply) \(=\) V(dep) + 100 V, case-C (n-on-n): V(apply) \(\geq\) V(dep) but V(apply) \(\leq\) 300 V,

Identical set of the evolution parameters as described in TDR is used except an additional term for short-time annealing. To evaluate the power generation in the bulk, the voltage dependence of the leak current recently measured is used. Results from thermal model simulation are also used to predict the thermal behavior of the module.

The study has revealed number of interesting observation such as

* non-linear increase of depletion voltage in later years,
* little difference in depletion voltage at -10\({}^{\circ}\)C and -15\({}^{\circ}\)C operation,
* stable thermal behavior up to the last 1\(\sim\)2 years of operation,
* the voltage limit as a main reason for life,
* one year extension of life by coverall type and/or -15\({}^{\circ}\)C operation,
* strong dependence of life on detector radius,
* strong dependence of life on maximum attainable volatge in case of p-on-n type.

Based on these observations, the author recommends a combined configuration of detector types as an optimum solution including a safety margin for detector operation.
