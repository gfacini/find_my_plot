###### Abstract

Previous detectors at \(p\)-\(\vec{p}\) machines have experienced problems with high muon trigger rates in the forward region due to muons produced in interactions between the beam and the machine. These 'beam halo' muons typically have a very small angle to the beam direction, and are dominated by muons of several GeV energy and at low radius relative to the beam line. The response of the ATLAS end-cap muon trigger to them has been investigated using a complete simulation of both the LHC machine components and the ATLAS detector and trigger. It is seen that the total flux of such muons in the end-cap trigger counters is \(\sim\) 60 kHz, in high luminosity LHC running, and the acceptance of the Level-1 end-cap muon trigger to these particles is \(\sim\)1%. The overall Level-1 trigger rate from such muons will be small compared to rates from the products of the \(p\)-\(p\) collision. The total rates from low- and high-\(p_{T}\) triggers at 6 and 20 GeV/c are 250 and 16 Hz respectively. Whilst these rates are negligible in comparison with the total rate from the Level-1 muon system, they are sufficient to enable such triggers to be used for calibration and alignment purposes.

**Draft 1.1, August 10, 1998**Introduction

It is known that accelerator related backgrounds at the LHC will contribute significantly to the overall particle flux seen in the experiments. Indeed recent studies have shown that rather significant shielding is required in order to limit this flux [1]. Without such protection the number of detector hits from halo particles at hadron colliders can equal or exceed that seen from particles originating from interaction products [2].

With the convergence on a final design for the LHC beam cleaning system and stable estimates of the vacuum conditions in the machine it has been possible for the first time to make reliable estimates of the muon flux arising from accelerator related backgrounds. This flux is of particular interest for studies of the muon trigger because of the potential of a significant muon flux to induce an intolerable rate in the muon trigger in forward regions where the flux is greatest. Historically some detectors at hadron-hadron machines have been forced to compromise the forward \(\eta\)-coverage of the muon trigger in order to maintain a tolerable trigger rate. This study is intended to examine whether the rate from such backgrounds can compromise the performance of the ATLAS end-cap muon trigger. The Level-1 trigger, has a strict ceiling on the rate that it is permitted to pass on to higher level triggers (75 KHz for initial running). Beam halo muons are a potentially substantial contribution to that rate.

The approach taken here in estimating the rate from beam halo muons is to use a dedicated Monte Carlo simulation of the processes that produce such muons and pass these through the fullest possible simulation of the ATLAS detector and trigger. Using the full machinery of the DICE [3] detector simulation and the Atrig [4] trigger simulation an estimate is extracted of the expected Level-1 trigger rate in the end-cap given current knowledge of the configuration of the ATLAS detector and trigger.

## 2 The simulation of beam halo muons

Accelerator related background in ATLAS is induced by beam losses at limiting apertures of the lattice (primarily the collimators) and by interactions of the beam with residual gas nuclei inside the beam pipe. Experience at the Tevatron [2] has shown that dedicated beam loss reduction collimators and significant concrete shielding at the hall-tunnel meeting point can significantly mitigate the background problem. At the Tevatron the total flux from electrons, muons and charged hadrons has been reduced to 0.2 Hz/cm\({}^{2}\) thanks to such collimators and a 1.5 m thick concrete wall at the cavern entrance. Similar systems are being designed for the LHC. Clearly the exact nature of such shielding in ATLAS will be a factor in the muon flux seen in the detector.

The simulation used here [5], for input to the ATLAS detector simulation, models the beam loss in the proton beam, assuming an inelastic \(pp\) cross-section of 80 mb and 3 \(\times 10^{14}\) particles per beam (corresponding to a beam current of 6 mA) accelerated to 7 TeV. This corresponds to typical 'high luminosty' (\(1\times 10^{34}cm^{-2}s^{-1}\)) LHC running. Interactions of these protons with residual nuclei are modelled using the MARS program [6, 7]. Interactions of the beam with the primary collimators (situated 6\(\sigma\) from the beam axis) and at all other limiting apertures are performed using the STRUCT code [8]. Showers in the high luminosty interaction regions (i.e. in the part of the ring between two arcs) are simulated using the MARS code. All detailed design considerations of the machine in these regions are taken into account. High energy muons are produced mainly in \(\pi\), K or heavy flavour decays following the interaction of beam particles with machine elements or residual gas.

The MARS code upon which these calculations depend has a long history of use in the calculation of accelerator backgrounds. The code allows the fast simulation of three dimensional hadronic and electromagnetic cascades across an extremely wide range of particle energies. The version of the code utilised here has been updated in response to the demands of recent accelerator developments [7]. (Notably the Tevatron upgrade and the convergence to a final design of the LHC). The MARS code calls other packages where necessary including MNCP for low energy neutron transport [9], and the STRUCT code for multi-turn particle tracking in collider rings. Recent comparisons of MARS predictions with data from high energy proton collisions with nuclei from E-802 at BNL demonstrate that MARS models such processes rather well [7].

The output of the simulation of beam-machine interactions at LHC is a file of muons and other particles described by their \(x\)-\(y\) position at the entrance to the experimental cavern, at a distance 26.5 m in z from the ATLAS interaction point, and the muon energy and direction. Such files have been used to make detailed studies of the flux arising from accelerator-related backgrounds in the CMS detector by Drozhdin et al. [5]. Here only the contribution of the muons has been studied, since they are expected to be the dominant accelerator related background. The contribution to the end-cap muon Level-1 trigger rate from hadrons and other particle types will be considered in a forthcoming study.

This file of muons describes the total flux seen in half a second from a single proton beam in the plane z=26.5 m (where the nominal ATLAS interaction point is at 0,0,0), this normalisation being performed by assigning each simulated muon a weight (typically far from unity). This weight must be considered in all calculations using these data, and here all fluxes, rates and histograms are calculated using these weights. (It should be noted that this results in even high statistics distributions appearing 'bumpy'.) This prescription makes it straightforward to calculate a flux per second and/or per unit area from such muons. Here all calculations are presented after multiplying by a factor two, to yield a true flux per second, and by a further factor two, to account for the two beams in the machine.

Figure 1 shows the muon energy and angle to the beamline in the simulated beam halo muon sample. It can be seen that the beam halo muons are dominated by low energy and low radius (the distance from the z axis) particles that are almost parallel to the beamline. However there are significant fluxes of particles at much higher energies - extending to the proton beam energy, in addition to high radius muons. The correlation between muon energy and angle, and energy and radius are also shown in Figure 1. Generally only the softest muons have a significant angle to the z axis, whilst there is little correlation between energy and radius. It should be recalled that the constraint within the end-cap muon trigger that muons point towards the interaction point should make the trigger rather insensitive to particles at small angles to the beamline, regardless of their radius in the chambers.

The flux per unit area at both the cavern entrance and the TGC pivot plane, as a function of radius, is shown in Figure 3, at two different z-planes:

* z=26.5 m, the cavern entrance
* z=14m, the approximate position of the pivot plane of the end-cap muon trigger chambers. (This is a linear extrapolation making the approximation of no magnetic field or material between the cavern entrance and the TGC pivot plane.)

The flux per unit area, projected into the \(xy\)-plane, is shown in Figure 3, at the same planes in z. It can be seen that the areas of maximum flux are beyond the inner acceptance of the TGCs in very forward regions (radius \(<250\) cm, \(\left|\eta\right|>2.5\)). The typical muon flux within the fiducial acceptance of the TGC counters is \(\sim 10^{-2}cm^{-2}s^{-1}\). Very high energy muons emitted tangentially in the plane of the machine can be seen at y=0, extending to positive x.

The total flux expected in the end-cap trigger counters has been calculated by integrating the flux as a function of radius between the inner and outer acceptance limits of the TGC counters. This yields a total flux, summing both proton beams, of \(\sim\) 60 kHz in _each_ end-cap.

The effect of shielding

The simulated muons used in this study are produced with no assumptions regarding the significant shielding that is likely to exist in the ATLAS cavern. Studies in [5] demonstrate the very substantial reductions in muon fluxes achieved with various shielding scenarios, particularly regarding a concrete plug around the beampipe at the entrance to the cavern, and a steel 'collar' around the beam-pipe over a region several hundred metres from the interaction point.

The optimization of the ATLAS shielding layout is continuing, but few elements of this design work have yet been incorporated into the ATLAS simulation software. An explicit radiation shield exists in the forward regions, which is not yet included in the DICE simulation. This shielding sits around the beam pipe in the region 8m \(<\) z \(<\)20 m, with a thickness ranging from less than 50 cm in the vicinity of the end-cap toroids to more than 2m at z\(\sim\) 20 m below the far plane of the MDT chambers. Whilst the typical halo muon is likely to be able to traverse rather significant material volumes, the flux of hadrons from which many muons arise can be reduced by such shielding. However the vast majority of the material that is likely to be placed in forward regions to shield the detector from accelerator related background is absent from present versions of the detector simulation. The modelled flux passed through the detector simulation in this study is thus likely to be an overestimate.

## 4 The TGC counters and the end-cap trigger logic

The Level-1 muon trigger in the end-cap is based on the measurement of muon trajectories in two or three different planes of Thin Gap Chambers (TGCs). The TGC counters have been described in detail elsewhere [10]. Muon momentum discrimination is provided by measurement of the difference in hit position from that expected from the infinite momentum path.

The trigger logic enables two different sets of single muon trigger thresholds ('low' and 'high') to be set, using different sets of trigger planes. A total of six thresholds can be set, three from each of the low and high-\(p_{T}\) configurations. The threshold values for which the trigger has been optimized are 6 GeV for the low-\(p_{T}\) trigger (to be used when the LHC machine is running at low luminosty, 1 \(\times 10^{33}cm^{-2}s^{-1}\)) and 20 GeV for the high-\(p_{T}\) trigger (at high luminosty, 1 \(\times 10^{34}cm^{-2}s^{-1}\)). The detail of the design of the trigger logic and a discussion of the simulation of both the end-cap muon trigger counters and trigger logic can be found in [12].

## 5 The ATLAS simulation

The data from the simulation of Drozhdin et al. is input to the ATLAS software chain using an interface routine that converts the muons in the flat file into a form that can be read by SLUG. The input muons are then treated identically to any other particle input via SLUG.

The simulation of the ATLAS detector is that of DICE 3.15. All significant material of ATLAS sub-detectors is included together with significant support structures. For the analysis of beam halo muons originating far from the interaction point there is little material in the simulation between the cavern entrance and the near side TGC pivot plane. For any muon to produce a trigger in far end-cap of the TGCs relative to the incoming proton beam, it must traverse all the substantial material of the end-cap toroids and the hadron calorimetry (both the hadronic end-cap and the extended barrel tile) on both sides of the interaction point. This corresponds to \(\sim\)20-30 absorption lengths.

The TGCs are fully modelled using Version M of the geometry. The trigger simulation used here is that of Atrig401, containing the muon end-cap trigger simulation code [11]. This is the code that has been used for all studies for the Level-1 Trigger TDR [12]. It contains a complete simulation of the logic of the trigger, including full simulation of all the hardware components of the electronics chain, from the output of the front-end readout chips to the final Level-1 end-cap muon trigger decision.

No simulation of the trigger timing is simulated. In principle the addition of a time window, as exists in the trigger electronics, can reduce the trigger rate relative to the estimate made here. However the geometry of the end-cap trigger counters is such the time-of-flight from the interaction point to the plane of the counters is rather close to the 25ns beam crossing time. Thus beam halo muons from following and preceding proton bunches will contribute to the rate seen in any one beam crossing. We thus neglect any dilution of the trigger rate that may occur due to the time coincidence requirements of the trigger.

## 6 Results of the acceptance study

100K simulated muons have been passed through the ATLAS simulation chain. The rate of triggers seen in the sample is shown in Figure 4 for both high- and low-\(p_{T}\) triggers, where these are at the nominal thresholds of 6 and 20 GeV \(p_{T}\) respectively. This implies total rates of 1560 Hz and 16 Hz for low- and high-\(p_{T}\) triggers respectively at _high_ luminosity. Since the beam halo flux scales according to beam _intensity_, to extract an accurate estimate of the low-\(p_{T}\) trigger rate in low luminosity running some conjecture must be made about likely beam currents in this mode. It has been estimated [5] that 10% of nominal ('high') luminosity can be achieved with 16% of the nominal beam current. Thus it can be assumed that the trigger rate from the 6 GeV, low-\(p_{T}\) trigger due to beam halo muons will be 16% of that seen here, i.e. \(\sim\) 250 Hz, at low luminosity running.

The initial energy and radius (i.e. the energy and radius at the entrance to the ATLAS cavern) of the muons that produce end-cap muon triggers are shown in Figure 6. The energy distribution is soft, as in the sample as a whole but the muons giving triggers are more isotropic in radius than the sample as a whole. Triggers in the near end-cap are dominated by soft muons, whilst those in the far end-cap are necessarily stiffer since they must traverse significant material in the detector before impinging on the far end-cap. In fact beam halo muons are produced at an angle to the beamline which logically cannot give a trigger. Only those halo muons that are soft enough when they traverse the trigger planes that multiple scattering and magnetic bending can 'fake' a track pointing to the interaction point will give a trigger. It is unsurprising that exposure to greater material and more field results in a greater fraction of triggers in the far than the near end-cap. The distribution of triggers in \(\phi\) is isotropic, as might be expected. The overall trigger probability for the sample of simulated halo muons is 1.15%.

## 7 Checks and uncertainties

A check has been made of the interface between SLUG and the simulated beam halo muons using stiff muon tracks. This has been done by creating files of 200 GeV muons in the same format as the beam halo data with an origin in the plane z=26.5m, a direction that passes through the interaction point and a radius at the TGCs within the TGC acceptance. When

passed through the detector simulation these muons are seen to give triggers with an efficiency \(\sim\)98%. This is considered an adequate test of the machinery of the interface to the data.

The overall performance of the simulation of the end-cap trigger counters and trigger logic is well known from the extensive studies done to determine efficiency for single muons generated at the interaction point [12].

Uncertainties on the total expected trigger rate from beam halo muons can be divided into several sources:

* **Uncertainties in the modelled beam halo flux** The muon flux seen in the simulation is subject to uncertainties from design changes in the LHC lattice (or a simple lack of knowledge at this time of the final design) as well as uncertainties in the modelling of the physics processes that produce the muons. The files used here were generated using version 4.2 of the LHC lattice, dating from 1996. The data generation has been repeated using a more recent version (5.0) of the lattice and only minor differences to the previous iteration seen. It is thus assumed that the main uncertainties arise from other sources. These include uncertainties in the beam loss source term (beam gas pressure and tails from the beam cleaning system and other IPs) and calculation model (physics processes, geometry and magnetic field uncertainties and simplifications, and statistics). The authors of the simulation estimate [13] these to be factors of 2-3 on the background flux in the first instance and a factor 2 in the second.
* **Uncertainties in the modelling of passive material** As has been discussed previously there are many deficiencies in the simulation with regard to planned shielding structures which have not been included in the DICE simulation used here. These will serve to reduce the total flux of muons, although in the

absence of Monte Carlo studies this effect is impossible to quantify. It can be stated with some confidence that the effects of such additional shielding will be to reduce the total rate observed due to beam halo muons, and so this builds some conservatism into the rates quoted here.
* **Uncertainties in modelling of active volumes, digitisation and trigger logic** The geometry and readout segmentation of the TGC counters used for these studies is considered rather final, and the use of a declustering algorithm makes trigger rates rather insensitive to the fine details of the digitisation. Similarly the trigger logic, in particular the size of the trigger windows in the simulation are likely to be very close to those of the built detector. It is thus likely that such uncertainties are rather small compared with others to which these results are subject.
* **LHC performance** The claim that the first few years of LHC running (at low luminosity) can be accom

plished with a beam current \(\sim\)16% that of nominal is subject to several assumptions. It assumes that the optimal tuning of the LHC machines is achievable at the start of such running, and that beam losses due to machine imperfections (not modelled by the simulation used here) are negligible. Neither of these scenarios is likely to be the case in the initial period of low luminosity running, resulting in potentially higher muon fluxes from beam loss background, and thus higher trigger rates.

## 8 Conclusions

A full simulation of beam loss processes in the LHC has been performed, and the muon flux arising from such accelerator related background has been calculated. The total flux of such halo muons expected in both end-caps of the muon end-cap trigger counters is \(\sim\) 60 KHz. These muons typically have energies of a few GeV and are produced at a small angle to the beamline. These simulated halo muons have been input to the ATLAS detector and trigger simulation. This simulation contains a detailed model of the ATLAS detector - but little of the potential shielding material designed to reduce machine backgrounds - and similarly detailed simulation of the logic of the end-cap muon trigger.

The acceptance of the Level-1 muon end-cap trigger to these beam halo muons is \(\sim\)1.2%, resulting in Level-1 trigger rates of 250 and 16 Hz respectively for the 6 GeV low-\(p_{T}\) and the 20 GeV high-\(p_{T}\) triggers. These rates are negligible in comparison with rates expected from \(p\)-\(p\) interaction products. The rates are high enough however to make beam halo muons a potentially useful source of calibration and alignment triggers.

These rates are based on a well understood and detailed simulation of beam-machine interactions, a tested and accurate simulation of the ATLAS detector and trigger and reasonable assumptions about the performance of the LHC machine. Uncertainties arise at all stages of the calculation, and where an estimate can be made these do not exceed factors of 2-3. In the event that the rate from beam halo is significantly higher than the estimates made here, even a factor of 10 increase in the rate would not pose significant problems to the Level-1 trigger.

Additional rate arising from accelerator related background from other particle types will be considered in a future study. The flux of charged hadrons is comparable to that seen from muons, but these hadrons are expected to have a lower acceptance in the trigger and thus to make a negligible contribution to the total rate.
