# Irradiation of an IBL stave in a 10Mev beta beam

###### Abstract

The new IBL detector (Insertable B-Layer), due to be integrated into the ATLAS detector as the closest Pixel layer to the beam pipe during the first LHC long-shutdown (2013), is composed of fourteen stave sub-assemblies. These staves have a triangular cross section carbon foam core, sandwiched between a triangular carbon fibre plate (omega) and a flat top plate (faceplate) onto which the silicon detector modules and services are glued. The assembly is strongly dependant on glue and thermal grease interfaces; high density amorphous materials prone to degradation under high radiation doses. In order to evaluate the mechanical stability and integrity of one of these staves it was decided to impose a very high radiation dose upon it, representative of the full dose IBL will receive in its life-cycle. Because of the lack of availability of proton beams - the closest approximation to the radiation received in operation - with a large enough sweep area and dose it was decided to undertake the experiment using an industrial electron beam. The ionization itself was performed at Ionisos in France, while the pre and post-irradiation tests were shared between CERN and the University of Geneva. After having been exposed to a beta dose equivalent to twice that expected in the IBL lifetime, a series of metrology surveys and thermal cycles were performed. It appears from metrology comparisons between the various steps in the experiment that the stave's stability was only minimally affected, with a maximum faceplate movement of 60 \(\mu\)m between the pre and post-irradiation metrologies. However it appears that the heating effects were of importance considering the grease pads had ran slightly when inspected after the irradiation. The temperature monitoring confirms that the stave experienced excessive temperatures, about 20\({}^{\circ}\)C higher than the maximum temperature experienced in operation, during the experiment. It is therefore complicated to separate the consequences of thermal and ionization effects on the stave. A series of peel samples irradiated with the stave in a beta beam as well as in a proton beam were used to compare the effect of these two types of irradiation on the glue interfaces.

## Introduction

The irradiation under 10Mev electrons of a single IBL (Insertable B-Layer) state was undertaken in order to obtain information on the assembly's radiation hardness at very high doses. Thus it was chosen to impose a dose close to IBL's full life-cycle (2.55 MGy in carbon equivalent) on a stave loaded with a single dummy silicon detector and assembled with a real electrical service bus. This irradiation was prepared at University of Geneva and CERN and ultimately performed at Ionisos1 (Chaumesnil, France) using an industrial electron beam. Following the ionisation the stave was returned to Geneva where a number of tests were led in order to observe and measure the effect of such a high dose on its mechanical stability and on the glue and thermal grease interfaces. The various stages in this project are presented in this report, starting with a description of the materials used and the experimental set-up as well as the preparation stages prior to the irradiation. The next section will give a step by step account of the proceedings on the day of the ionisation, followed by sections covering the post-irradiation tests and observations as well as the dosimetry calculations and temperature monitoring results. Small peel samples of Kapton/Carbon were also irradiated and subsequently tested to evaluate the glue strength. The results of these tests are presented and compared with results after proton irradiation. Finally a conclusion will offer a review of the success of this experiment and suggest future experimentations.

## 1 Aims and test justification

The ATLAS Insertable B-Layer is set to be installed in the ATLAS cavern in 2014 between a new, reduced diameter beam pipe and the current b-layer; it is therefore the closest part of the ATLAS detector to the proton collisions and consequently the most affected by radiation from the interaction point. Various critical materials and parts of the detector have independently been irradiated to ensure their mechanical and thermal integrity at large doses. However this test has never been performed on a full length stave of 75 cm. The integrity and stability of the stave under high doses is critical for the sub-detector assembly, therefore it was essential to evaluate its behaviour.

Here it is important to state that electrons were used for the experiment at Ionisos (leading to Ionizing energy losses - IEL - in the materials), although the radiation received by the IBL in its life time would have been closer approximated by a proton beam (Non ionizing energy losses: NIEL). This is due to the fact that a proton beam's irradiation area is limited, and the dose rate being low exposition times would have to be important, making the use of such beam incompatible with CERN schedules. Furthermore, it was of interest to observe the effect of these IEL effects on amorphous materials2 and to be able to compare them to NIEL effects. Finally the use of electron beams allows for post-treatment of the ionised parts with no radionucleide activation and risk for the operator.

Footnote 2: IEL effects are known to be the largest contribution to the modification of the mechanical properties of amorphous materials

## 2 Experimental preparation and set-up

### Irradiation dose

The dose and dose rate imposed on the stave during irradiation must be measured in order to link them with later observations. The idea being to qualify the stave assembly and various mechanical interfaces for a dose representative of what the IBL will receive in operation.

#### 2.1.1 Total IBL dose

The expected integrated dose received by IBL throughout its 8 years of planned operation as the closest layer to the beam in the ATLAS experiment is 5*1015 1MeV neutron equivalent per cm\({}^{2}\) or 8*1015 24 Gev/cm\({}^{2}\) protons per cm\({}^{2}\). Thus it is estimated that for carbon equivalent materials the total dose would be 2.55 MGy.

#### 2.1.2 Pre-Irradiation dosimetry

In order to obtain a dose within 10% of the value above on the day of the experiment, a set of dosimeters was sent to Ionisos in order to obtain information on the dose delivered by its beta beam. Four types of dosimeters were sent:

* **FWT-60 film** (read-out by colorimetry): Maximum dose of 200 kGy
* **PAD Alanine** (read out using EPR3 spectrometer): Maximum dose of 100 kGy
* **RPL**: Maximum dose of 2.5 MGy
* **TLD Thermo-Luminescent**: Maximum dose of 1 MGy

Footnote 3: Electron Paramagnetic Resonance

The aim was to obtain a dose rate for the Ionisos electron beam in order to determine the irradiation times needed to impose the total IBL lifetime expected dose. However due to various issues with over-exposition and over-heating of dosimeters only two types of dosimeters (FWT60 and RPL) yielded exploitable data when read at CERN upon their return. The dosimetry results for the default beam parameters are presented graphically below. It must be noted that the electron beam at Ionisos has a ramp-up time of 40s before attaining its steady-state dose rate, therefore making the linear extrapolation valid only after 40s.

From these results it was decided to irradiate the stave in 60 second runs, between which enough time would be given for the stave to cool down to its lowest temperature. This consideration arises from the realisation that the ionizing beam has a high enough dose rate and power to heat the stave up dramatically, as will be discussed in Section 2.4.

#### 2.1.3 Irradiation dosimetry

In order to cross-check the dosimetry calculations, verify the dose per run and the spatial dose homogeneity, 9 dosimeters were used during the experiment. The dosimeters were placed at both extremities and in the centre of the stave for the first three runs. The results are presented in Section 4.

Figure 1: Dosimetry results measured prior to the stave irradiation

### The stave

The stave to be irradiated (ST-4-1-05-12) was selected from the available bare production staves and was loaded with a silicon wafer acting as a dummy IBL module in addition to six thermal grease pads and thermal glue to hold it in place. Figures 2, 3, 4 present a model view of the stave set-up for irradiation as well as views of the stave as it was prior to the experiment. Figure 2 shows the zone to be irradiated between brackets.

### Stave support

A support structure was built to hold the stave during transport and irradiation. A carbon fibre tube of thickness 300 \(\mu\)m surrounded the stave which was held inside using ABS support parts as shown in Figure 5. This carbon fibre tube is supported by a structure made out of PVC and aluminium profiles that are not exposed to the beam.

### Thermal Finite Element Analysis modelling

It was anticipated that the high dose rate (250 kGy/min equivalent to a power of 4.2 W/g) delivered by the electron beam at Ionisos would lead to rapid and important heating of the irradiated assembly. Therefore in order to avoid modifying the glue and thermal-grease interfaces by thermal effects, a maximum temperature of 40 \({}^{\circ}\)C was decided upon. The problem was that if any thermal effects affected the stave structure they would be difficult to distinguish from the consequences of the radiation, which would render the post-irradiation analysis complicated.

So as to evaluate the heating of the stave a thermal Finite Element Analysis (FEA) was led on the stave, the support structure and the temperature sensors. This helped in the selection of the cooling systems as well as in the monitoring of the temperature on the day of irradiation.

#### 2.4.1 Stave heating

A simplified 3D model of the stave was developed using the Abaqus software and a heating power equivalent to the 250 kGy/min dose rate was applied. The simplifications included squaring of

Figure 4: Dummy silicon wafer glued onto grease pads

Figure 3: Six thermal grease pads on stave

Figure 2: Model view of irradiated staveround corners, simplification of complex and small geometries in the aim of reducing computing time. Furthermore no convective heat-transfer between the stave and ambient air was taken into account; the only cooling condition is a temperature and heat-transfer coefficient applied inside the titanium cooling tube. This could be considered as a worst-case-scenario analysis. A view of the model is presented in Figure 6. From the graphical results presented in Figure 6 it appears that the maximum temperature observed on the stave assembly occurs on the flex wing. The reason for this is the high density and low thermal conductivity of the polyimide material as well as the distance from the cooling tube. This part is not the most critical and can therefore cope with the temperatures observed in these calculations.

The results from various runs at different conditions are tabulated below and indicate that in order to avoid any temperature above 40\({}^{\circ}\)C the performance of the cooling must be as least as good as h=4000 W/m\({}^{2}\)K at 5\({}^{\circ}\)C.

Results for a heat transfer coefficient of 2000 W/m\({}^{2}\)K are included as this was the cooling capacity evaluated using a numerical method (Leveque's method with a chilled water flow rate of 0.1 L/min at 5\({}^{\circ}\)C). This was not a problem on the day of the experiment as the temperature of the water could be lowered to 2\({}^{\circ}\)C and would therefore account for the lower heat-transfer coefficient.

#### 2.4.2 Support-tube heating

In this case the tube is a non-crucial part of the assembly and its only limit in terms of heating is to avoid loosing its mechanical properties during the course of the irradiation. This suggests that a

maximum temperature of 100\({}^{\circ}\)C is allowable, and considered to be safe with respect to FEA results under normal experimental conditions.

#### 2.4.3 Temperature sensor heating

The issue that was faced in the case of the temperature sensors is that due to their exposure to the beam they would heat-up by ionization, as all solids do under such conditions, as well as through their contact with the object of which they are monitoring the temperature. This would lead to an offset between the read-out temperature and the actual temperature of the stave (Delta T in Table 2). The values for this offset were explored in Abaqus and are tabulated below.

Thus the offset will vary between 8 and 20\({}^{\circ}\)C approximately, depending on the cooling conditions.

#### 2.4.4 Remarks concerning FEA

It must be noted that these FEA calculations are based upon the theory of ionisation and are steady-state results. Therefore they are only approximations that may serve as guidance in the preparation of the experiment and on the day. The results are in no way exact and cannot be used as references. This is caused by a number of aspects of ionizing power dissipation and finite-element analysis such as the instant deposition of power, the simplification of model geometry or the approximations linked to heat-transfer coefficients.

### Services

All services were tested during a dry-run at SR1 a week prior to the experiment to evaluate the functionality of the overall equipment.

#### 2.5.1 Cooling

The various methods for cooling were adopted after having performed FEA calculations on the assembly (see Section 2.4). Three different methods were used simultaneously:

* Chiller: circulating demineralised water at approximately 5\({}^{\circ}\)C through the stave's titanium cooling tube
* Dry-Air: blown into the support tube by four 8 mm diameter tubes
* Ambient air: blown over the support tube by a fan connected to two 150 mm diameter tubes.

These three cooling systems and their associated services are shown in the following figures.

#### 2.5.2 Temperature monitoring

The use of a temperature monitoring system was crucial to the success of the experiment, therefore 8 temperature sensors (NTC Semitec 103JT-025) were installed on various parts of the stave (see Figure 9 for temperature sensor mapping). The data from these sensors was read using a dedicated application written in LabView.

## 3 Step-by-step experimental report

### Beam calibration

The beam produced by the electron accelerator at Ionisos can be tuned in its length (x) but not in its width (y) (see Figure 12). To be able to irradiate the stave fully over the area wanted it is therefore necessary to first align the structure with the centreline of the beam and calibrate the beam length. This is done using a PMMA (Plexiglas(r)) plate covered with a PVC film screwed to the support structure as shown in Figure 10. The heating caused by the beam then marks out a zone on the film which corresponds to the area scanned by the beam.

Several iterations of this procedure were performed in order to obtain a satisfying configuration. A number of issues were noted: the lack of precision of this technique due to the fact that the heat affects more than only the area hit by the beam, the heating of the plastics used which led to the near destruction of the PMMA plate. Figure 10 below illustrates these difficulties.

In Figure 12 the main variables (stave height and window width) used to tune the scan length in 'x' are shown. In order to obtain the desired irradiation length of 650 mm, we had to set the scan parameter (window aperture) to the minimum allowed value. Nevertheless this was not enough and the stave was raised by 5 cm. The comparison between the default values (reference dosimetry) and the irradiation are listed in the following table.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|} \cline{2-3} \multicolumn{1}{c|}{} & Window & Height \\ \hline Default parameters & 650 & 40 \\ \hline Irradiation parameters & 350 & 35 \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}

\end{table}
Table 3: Temperatures at sensor positions evaluated using FEA modeling It must also be noted that the beam length - its sweep area - was reduced from its nominal value (used in pre-irradiation dosimetry study) whilst keeping the same beam intensity, therefore increasing the dose rate. This increase, suggests that the heating effect and dose rate may be higher than anticipated (see more details in Sections 3.3 and 5) as highlighted by the state of the PMMA and PVC after 2 min of irradiation (see Figure 10).

### Experiment installation

The stave irradiation is supported logistically by an important amount of apparatus and services, the installation of which is an important and time consuming step in the experimental process. The entirety of services, apparatus and tooling was transported from CERN and University of Geneva to the Ionisos location. On site it had to be set-up correctly, and all electrical components (chiller, fan, dryer) had to be protected to avoid any interaction of the residual Compton effect4. Thus it was necessary to protect these machines with thick lead sheets or to position them as far away as possible from the beam.

Footnote 4: The Compton effect is a result of the scattering of the electrons while traversing matter, producing photon radiation. Compton scattering can be damageable to electronics.

The steps in the installation can be summed up as follows:

1. Careful positioning of electronic apparatus. Includes setting up power supplies.
2. Preparation of services. Cables and cooling tubes positioned, ready to be connected to stave.
3. Stave support tube positioning (after beam calibration).
4. Service connection and functionality tests.

It was realised that the pressure of the compressed air supply at Ionisos was lower than the pressure in the supply used at CERN for the mock-up. Therefore the cooling capacity of the dry-air blown inside the support tube was lower than anticipated.

### Irradiation

The state of the PMMA plate and PVC film after 2 minutes of irradiation, as well as the possibility of a higher beam intensity due to the new beam settings, suggest that the heating of the stave would be a very important factor in the actual irradiation process. During the very first run, planned to last 60 seconds, it was decided to shut down the beam after 50 seconds due to the high temperatures reached (see temperature monitoring in Section 4.1). Furthermore it was finally decided to make 50 seconds the nominal irradiation time.

Figure 11: Cooling services set-up

Another decision was taken during the irradiation process. Due to the shortening of the beam window the dose rate per unit area was higher (see Figure 12 for a schematic of the situation), a basic calculation of dose was made and it was decided to stop the irradiation after 9*50 sec runs. To estimate the new dose per run two variables were taken into account, the 'window' parameter and the stave position (height). The window parameter value was 650 for the calibration and 350 for the stave irradiation (these parameters are considered without units as they are nominal values from the Ionisos machine). Also the height of the irradiated object varied from pre-irradiation dosimetry to the actual stave irradiation, going from 35 cm to 40 cm. The relationship between dose rates was then evaluated to follow a factor:

\[\frac{StaveDose}{DesimeterDose}=\frac{650}{350}\times\frac{40}{35}=2.12 \tag{1}\]

Unfortunately this calculation is just an estimation of the rate between both settings. After irradiation the exact values of the beam size for different heights were extrapolated from the table in Appendix A assuming a linear behaviour for data points out of the range. Then the dose ratio (old/new beam configuration) given that the beam intensity is fixed derives directly from the ratio between the two sweep lengths in mm:

\[\frac{986.5}{526}=1.9 \tag{2}\]

The precise total dose received by the stave during the irradiation was evaluated using the 9 dosimeters placed on the support tube during the first three runs, the analysis of these results is described in Section 5.

The following table gives the irradiation times for the 9 runs:

### Post-Irradiation

The irradiation process over, the stave and apparatus were returned to CERN and Geneva University. A series of tests were planned to take place in Geneva in order to fully inspect the stave's reaction to such a high dose. The next steps were as follows:

Post irradiation results are presented in Section 6.

## 4 Temperature data analysis

### Temperature monitoring

8-temperature sensors located on the stave as shown in Figure 13, monitored the temperature as mentioned in Section 2.5. Thanks to a LabView readout the temperature evolution during the irradiation was recorded. This made it possible to refer to temperature data when observing whether or not the thermal action had an impact on the mechanical structure. Furthermore, due to the tight relation between the irradiation and the temperature increase, it also allowed for a cross-check between the runs evolution and the uniformity run to run.

For the first run, the data from all sensors is shown in Figure 9. A large temperature spread is observed between them, as expected from simulations (cf. Section 2.4). In Table 6 temperature values for all sensors after 50 s of irradiation are reported. The temperature spread is mainly due to the different material densities, varying from copper to carbon foam. The highest temperatures - excluding sensor 8 placed on the carbon fibre support tube - are observed at sensors 3 and 5, positioned on the flex. This is due to the high density of the flex and its poor thermal conductivity. Also the drop in temperature along the A-C direction - sensors 1, 2, 6 and 7 - can be explained by the fact that the cooling fluid travelled in the opposite direction, from C to A.

To illustrate the stability run to run using 'calorimetry', the temperature measurements from sensor 7 for each of the runs are overlaid in Figure 9, showing a great reproducibility. This is of major importance if we need to trust our final dose calculation on the three first run dose measurements alone (Section 5).

### Post-irradiation FEA data (new-dose)

The finite element calculations performed prior to the irradiation process were updated to take into account the new dose imposed on the stave. These new results helped when trying to evaluate temperatures at locations far away from the sensors.

#### 4.2.1 Stave

The results for updated FEA calculations on the stave are presented below. They take into account the fact that the dose rate imposed was approximately 500 kGy/min instead of the 250 kGy/min previously expected.

In these FEA results the temperature does not vary along the tube length as it does in the data obtained during the experiment, this is due to the fact that the cooling in the model is uniform along the titanium cooling tube. The imposed cooling condition uses a heat transfer coefficient and a fixed temperature, corresponding to the first two columns of Table 8.

#### 4.2.2 Temperature sensors

Using the same dose rate value as above, a new result was found for the temperature observed on the sensor's active area. From this value the approximate temperature offset caused by the material's own heating was evaluated. A 63\({}^{o}\)C boundary condition was imposed on the glue under the sensor, corresponding to the carbon support tube's temperature calculated using an FEA model with the new dose rate value. The resulting graphical representation of the temperature distribution on the sensor is shown in Figure 15.

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|} \hline Sensor 1 & Sensor 2 & Sensor 3 & Sensor 4 \\ \hline

Table 8: Temperatures at sensor positions evaluated using FE analysis with a dose rate of 500 kGy/minFrom the results above one can evaluate the sensor's active zone temperature at approximately 80\({}^{\circ}\)C. This suggests that the temperature offset caused by the sensor's own heating is about 17\({}^{\circ}\)C.

### Temperature data analysis conclusion

No issue was noted in temperature monitoring during the irradiation. It was anticipated that any disconnection of the temperature sensors would cause the read-out to jump to -50\({}^{\circ}\)C for that sensor. On the other hand any ungluing from the stave or support tube would lead to important heating due to the lack of thermal contact leading to temperatures of around 500\({}^{\circ}\)C (from FEA calculations). None of this was observed which suggests that the temperatures measured are coherent and representative of the situation. Thermal contact was confirmed after irradiation during the visual inspection (Section 6.2).

Nevertheless as mentioned an issue arises from the fact that two heat processes were imposed on the sensors: the temperature of the object to which they were glued and their own body heating caused by the ionizing beam. It is not possible to evaluate the convection and ambient temperature conditions imposed on the sensor, therefore the only values on which to base an offset temperature are the results of FEA calculations.

## 5 Dosimeter analysis

The total dose received during the 9*50 sec runs was extrapolated using the dosimetry measurements of the first three runs. The analysis of the data from the dosimeters was performed at CERN.

### First three runs

Dosimetry results for the first three runs are summarized in Table 8 and Figure 16. A relative error of 6% has been estimated to take into account the uncertainties on the dosimeter calibration curve and the variation of their response in function of the temperature.

The average dose for the first three runs had been calculated using the data from the 3 dosimeters. The error was estimated taking into account the uncertainties for each of the doses, as well as the standard deviation from the spatial un-homogeneity.

### Total dose estimation

In order to calculate the total dose received by the stave it is necessary to process the data in Section 5.1. Firstly the first run must be considered separately as it was shorter and therefore imposed a lower dose on the stave. Secondly, by merging the values for runs 2 and 3 it is possible to obtain a dose per run. The merging of the two values is necessary to take into account the various unknowns and errors in the run parameters (beam intensity and stability, run time). Thus the total dose can be evaluated as:

\[D_{Total}=(346\pm 52)+8\times(442\pm 57)=3.8\pm 0.5MGy \tag{3}\]

If one considers that runs 2 & 3 are more mutually homogeneous than the average, it is possible that the error is under-estimated. In order to avoid this and thanks to the precision of the temperature readout it is possible to affirm that runs have the same exposure time within an error of 1 sec,

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|} \cline{2-4} \multicolumn{1}{c|}{} & Run \#1 & Run \#2 & Run \#3 \\ \hline Position 0 & 305 \(\pm\) 18 kGy & 480 \(\pm\) 28 kGy & 474 \(\pm\) 28 kGy \\ \hline Position C & 350 \(\pm\) 21 kGy & 463 \(\pm\) 27 kGy & 417 \(\pm\) 25 kGy \\ \hline Position A & 385 \(\pm\) 23 kGy & 415 \(\pm\) 24 kGy & 406 \(\pm\) 24 kGy \\ \hline Average & 346 \(\pm\) 52 kGy & 453 \(\pm\) 54 kGy & 432 \(\pm\) 56 kGy \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 9: Dosimetry results from the first three runsequivalent to 1.6%. If one assumes constant dose rate with respect to time, then this error evaluation can be propagated to the total dose value. It is calculated that the total dose is 3.8\(\pm\)0.56 MGy.

This leads to an average dose rate of:

\[DoseRate=\frac{3.8\times 10^{6}}{(50\times 8)+46}=8.5kGy/sec\approx 508kGy/min \tag{4}\]

## 6 Visual inspections and metrology surveys

### Irradiated stave's life cycle

The graph in Figure 17 below shows the temperature conditions imposed on the stave when it undergoes thermal cycling. It must be noted that all thermal cycles were done between -40\({}^{o}\)C and 40\({}^{o}\)C, this will be assumed throughout the rest of the report, while the humidity was kept as low as possible (1-35 %)

### Visual observation

The first task following the irradiation and removal of the stave from its support tube was to inspect it. The first observation was that no visible movement or loss of glue contact had occurred throughout the experiment. Secondly it appeared that the grease pad under the dummy silicon detector had ran slightly and accumulated around the sides of the silicon as can be seen in Figure 18. This hinted at a phase change (solid to liquid and possibly vapor) of the grease during the irradiation process.

Figure 18: View, after irradiation, of the dummy Si module glued on the faceplate. Thermal grease is clearly visible along the edge of the module.

An inspection of the four thermal grease pads not covered by the dummy silicon module revealed no detectable difference. The colour and viscosity of the grease as it was removed for the metrology were deemed not to have changed. The only point to note is that the surface was slightly dry, however this can be explained by the lack of isolation from ambient air and the heating caused by the irradiation which certainly led to a slight drying of the grease's surface.

Before running a metrology on the stave it was also necessary to remove all temperature sensors. This was done after having checked the integrity of the glue joining the sensors to the stave or stave flex. The table below summarizes the observations made.

### Metrology survey

The aim of the experiment being to observe the effect of high irradiation doses on the stave's integrity and stability, it was necessary to undertake a number of metrology inspections throughout the various stages. First a metrology was conducted before the irradiation, then after the irradiation. Next an inspection was led after the first thermal cycling and finally after the second set of thermal cycles. The results from these metrologies will be compared here. All graphical representations of these comparisons are reproduced in Appendix C.

#### 6.3.1 Metrology method

To perform a metrology on a stave it is placed on its carbon fibre handling frame and positioned in the dedicated CMM (coordinate measuring machine). This measures the vertical position of various points on the stave with respect to the origin, alignment holes and reference surface near the end blocks. Three zones are differentiated in the machine's measurements (see Figure 19) Phi0, Phi+ and Phi-.

#### 6.3.2 Comparison between metrologies before and after irradiation

The comparison of metrology results from pre and post-irradiation inspections shows that the maximum variation in vertical coordinates is 60 \(\mu\)m. This is the measurement of a change in the height of a point in Phi+ around 500 mm along the stave. Also the average difference between pre and post-irradiated measurements is 22 \(\mu\)m. This shows that even punctually in the vertical direction the face-plate has not moved out of the IBL specifications.

Table 11: Summary of observations made during temperature sensor ungluing

Figure 19: Sketch of the stave layout during metrology (r-direction out of plane)

However a number of remarks must be made. Firstly the maximum and average values given above are based upon a set of results excluding the values obtained from measurements on the dummy silicon wafer. This exclusion is due to the fact that the measurements on the silicon do not have their counterparts in the pre-irradiation metrology - at this point the silicon had not been placed on the stave. Secondly looking at punctual differences does not yield all possible movements of the stave.

In Figure 20 the coordinates of the points measured across the face-plate are plotted. It clearly appears that the two curves - pre and post irradiation measurements - are out of phase by nearly 100 mm, meaning that the highest point on the stave has shifted along its length. This could suggest that the stave has endured a certain amount of torsion in the course of the experiment. It is possible to visualise this torsion by plotting these points in the CATIA5 environment and creating a corresponding surface. However it is not possible to determine whether this torsion is due to transport, thermal effects, ionisation of the materials or simply stresses from the handling frame during the metrology. Another possibility is that the presence of the flex on one side of the stave and not the other may have led to asymetric stress conditions in the part. This is amplified by the fact that the flex has a higher coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) than the carbon based materials to which it is glued and would thus tend to impose a certain amount of stress on the side to which it is attached.

Footnote 5: CATIA is a 3D modelling environment part of Dassault System’s suite of CAD and FEA softwares.

From this comparison between pre and post-irradiation metrologies it is possible to conclude that the irradiation, even at high doses and dose rates, has not affected the stave's shape and dimensions to a large extent. Thus no significant effects were observed in terms of stability of the mechanical envelope.

## 7 After further thermo-mechanical stress

After all observations had been made on the irradiated stave, it was thermally stressed further. Firstly 10 cycles were imposed on it, after which a new metrology analysis was performed. The next step was to inflict another 100 thermal cycles on the stave before undertaking a final metrology. The results from these tests help to understand the effect of important thermo-mechanical stresses on the stave after irradiation.

### Metrology results

#### 7.1.1 Comparison between metrologies before and after 10 thermal cycles

Comparing the metrologies performed just after the irradiation process and after a first set of thermal cycles (as described in Section 6.1) shows that the maximum difference in the r-direction between

Figure 20: Metrology results comparison - pre & post irradiation - for Phi

two points is around 60 \(\mu\)m and the average difference is 15 \(\mu\)m. It is again possible that the stave underwent a certain amount of torsion as the values in r for constant z vary along the phi direction, meaning that the height of Phi- and Phi+ is different at certain points.

The movement observed is within the IBL specification limits. Thus, after irradiation and 10 thermal cycles, the stave remains relatively stable. This suggests that the stave's materials are stable in themselves, but more importantly that the glue can take high levels of thermal stress and remain strong.

#### 7.1.2 Comparison between metrologies before and after 100 thermal cycles

After having imposed 100 thermal cycles on the stave, a final metrology was undertaken. Comparing these results to those obtained after the first set of thermal cycles shows little movement of the faceplate. The maximum difference between the two metrologies is 59 \(\mu\)m and the average difference is 21 \(\mu\)m. The maximum movement occurs in Phi-, with certain areas of Phi+ having moved by nearly 40 \(\mu\)m. On the other hand the Phi0 zone exhibits very little difference between the two metrologies. This can be explained by the fact that the central part of Phi0 is fixed to the handling frame thus giving the zone a tighter position stability from test to test. Furthermore the larger differences in the two side zones (Phi- and Phi+) can also be explained by an increase in the torsion observed after the irradiation and the first set of thermal cycles. Figure 21 below shows the graphical representation of the comparison between metrologies performed on Phi- before and after 100 thermal cycles.

### Visual observations

After having performed these metrology tests a final inspection of the stave was led. Visually, no difference could be noted with respect to the observations made immediately after the irradiation. However an attempt at removing the dummy silicon module from the faceplate brought forward two important points. Firstly, as can be seen in Figure 22, the glue under the module was still strong enough to cause the silicon to break before it could be unglued. This means that the glue's mechanical properties were not (or only slightly) affected by the treatment imposed on the stave.

Secondly in Figure 22 it is also clear that the grease under the Si module has modified its layout during the experimental process, thus loosing its spread homogeneity. This is probably caused by gas losses formed due to phase change gases escaping along certain routes of minimum resistance. Nevertheless the grease still covers the entirety of the zone under the silicon in a relatively homogeneous pattern. This is a good sign considering the presence of this grease is extremely important in the cooling of the detector.

## 8 Kapton/carbon fibre samples

24 GeV proton beams are closer to what the detector and structure will see in the LHC, however electron beams are easier to generate. Thus one of the aims of the experiment undertaken at Ionisos was to compare the impact of ionization (Beta beams) with respect to proton beams. In parallel to the stave ionisation, 8 samples made of Kapton and carbon fibre were ionised. Because the cross-sectional area of the proton beam was limited to a 10 mm diameter disc, miniature peel specimens were used. These were fixed to the outer surface of the carbon support tube (see Figure 17) using Kapton tape. The geometry and composition of such samples is as follows:

* **Carbon fibre** parts made out of 3 layers [0\({}^{o}\) 90\({}^{o}\) 0\({}^{o}\)] of T300 fibre type.
* **Kapton** parts prepared as follows: _A first layer made of 25 \(\mu m\) of epoxy acrylic glue + 25 \(\mu m\) kapton+25\(\mu m\) of epoxy acrylic glue is glued on a 100 \(\mu m\) kapton sheet +25 \(\mu m\) of epoxy acrylic glue._

The total kapton part thickness is measured to be 200 \(\mu\)m This sandwich structure was cured at 180\({}^{o}\)C in a pressed oven (with Tedlarde-moulding foil) and wet etching was performed on both sides (slurry pumice).

The sample geometry is as follows:

To break the sample, each kapton extremity is fixed in pull test machine jaws in order to peel off the glue. During the traction, there is a 90\({}^{o}\) angle between the kapton part and the glue + carbon fibre part:

The glue used is a bi-component epoxy based resin called _Araldite 2011_. The Araldite hardening took place at room temperature and was followed by a post curing at 40\({}^{o}\)C for 2 hours. 50 samples were manufactured. Some samples were kept as references and others were irradiated in a proton beam at CERN6. 8 were irradiated at Ionisos. Finally, 5 other samples were cured in an oven at 75\({}^{o}\)C. This post-curing was done in nine 50 second runs in order to re-create the thermal ageing

Figure 23: Kapton / carbon fibre sample geometry

Figure 22: Detailed views of parts after irradiationsuffered by ionised samples in the electron beam. The following table summarises the life of these various samples:

The peel test results are shown in the following graph, where blue dots represent non irradiated samples, green triangles ionised samples and red squares irradiated samples in a proton beam. Post-cured samples are represented by crosses. No difference was noticed for reference samples between the 19\({}^{th}\) of October and the 19\({}^{th}\) of December.

Reference samples (labelled as _Not irradiated_ in the graph) present an average maximum force at fracture equal to 22.6N and a standard deviation of 6.2N. Failure of the adhesive dominates in this mode: the glue is removed from the carbon fibre, in other words, for most samples the glue stays on the kapton side.

It clearly appears that all samples irradiated in the proton beam7 present a lower force at fracture (average= 4.6N) and the deviation between samples is very low (0.75N). In this case most of the samples present an adhesive failure (the glue is peeled off the kapton or the carbon fibre, depending on the sample). This strength drop is not well explained8 as the failure mode is quite similar between irradiated and non-irradiated samples. In addition, no strong temperature effect occurred during

Table 12: Kapton / carbon fibre life-cyclethis irradiation, as temperature was monitored all along the test and it never went over 26\({}^{\circ}\)C. It is important to notice that no differences were noticed between irradiated and non-irradiated samples before breaking them9.

Footnote 9: The sample surface state after failure has been checked with a simple microscope. No scanning electron microscopy control neither infrared spectrometry were performed as most of the information on the failure is commonly got from a macroscopic observation.

Ionised samples present an average force at break (20.2N) which is close to the non-irradiated batch. Here the deviation is higher and it could be explained by the beam density inaccuracy (as such samples were fixed all along the carbon fibre pipe, on top of the flex). The sample inspection after failure reveals that the glue has spread on the kapton part which was not the case before (it clearly appears on 7 ionised samples out of 8 that glue went out of the bonded area). It points out another aspect of the ionisation: the heat generated during each run. A maximum temperature of 93\({}^{\circ}\)C was measured on the carbon fibre pipe at the end of every 50s run. Taking into account a heating of the sensor itself due to its density (about 20\({}^{\circ}\)C delta T with respect to the temperature of the support tube according to the calculation in Section 4.2), it would mean that samples were cureinine times at about 78\({}^{\circ}\)C. Knowing that the glue Tg is 45\({}^{\circ}\)C we are certain that the glue became softer and it can explain the glue spreading observed on samples and some characteristics improvement due to the post-curing.

Post cured samples (cured nine times at 73\({}^{\circ}\)C) were finally realised to try to decouple the thermal and irradiation effect of the ionisation. Most of these samples present an adhesive failure (as reference samples). If we consider that the thermal aging suffered by ionised samples and cured samples is

Figure 27: Detail view of an irradiated (proton beam) sample after failure

Figure 25: Pull forces (N) from peel test samples

similar in terms of impact on mechanical properties, we clearly see that the electron beam has lowered ionised samples forces at failure. As expected10, cured samples present an average force at failure (27.8N) higher than reference samples which only have room temperature curing.

Footnote 10: The anadlite 2011 data sheet reveals that an aluminium lap shear sample cured at 70\({}^{\circ}\)C during one hour is 22% stronger in terms of shear stress than a sample cured at 25\({}^{\circ}\)C during 5 days.

It is clear that the electron beam did not cause the same damage as the proton beam on such samples and this peel tests results confirm it. The thermal action is stronger with the ionising process than with the proton beam. It is important to point out that ionized samples do not really well describe what happen on the ionised stave mainly due to the high dose rate and as both parts were fixed in two different places during the test with different cooling systems. It means that the mechanical capacities of the glue present on the ionised stave are not well represented by ionised samples results. The main difference between such samples and the ionised stave is the temperature they encountered during each run which is higher (about 17\({}^{\circ}\)C) for all samples.

## Conclusions

The IBL stave irradiated in this experiment underwent a series of extreme tests in order to evaluate its stability and mechanical integrity. At least two distinct phenomena affected the materials involved: heating (due to the high dose rate) and ionization. These are clearly different and yet extremely hard to isolate in this case, due to their common occurrence. This came to be a difficulty in the analysis of the results and the forming of solid conclusions.

Although the initial justification for the test was to qualify the stave in terms of its resistance to high radiation doses, it appears that extreme temperature conditions were also imposed upon it. During the ionization process the temperature varied very rapidly between 20\({}^{\circ}\)C and about 70\({}^{\circ}\)C, nine times in a row. To this one must add the two sets of thermal cycles, in total 110 times -40\({}^{\circ}\)C to 40\({}^{\circ}\)C. These imposed conditions and the very positive metrology results - no more than 60 \(\mu\)m movement between two stages of the test - suggest that the stave assembly is extremely stable under high thermo-mechanical stresses.

Complications arise when one tries to factor out these thermal effects in order to observe the influence of the high dose of electrons imposed on the stave. This dose is the electron equivalent of approximately twice the dose received by the IBL assembly during its functional life-time at the centre of the ATLAS detector. However from the peel-test results in Section 8 it seems that the glue used in the assembly is affected to a very little extent by the ionization process. This can be compared to the important loss of mechanical strength caused by proton irradiation. Nevertheless the electron beam's effect may be observed in the fact that samples post-cured in thermal conditions similar to that of the ionization are stronger than those having been ionized. This does not allow for a complete isolation of the ionizing effects, however it seems to indicate that some mechanical properties were affected by the beam.

Thus it appears that the test is not suitable for a full validation of the stave's integrity under the radiation conditions existent close to the LHC beam. What can be said with certainty is that ionizing beams - electrons - have a minor effect on the stave's shape and therefore seem to affect the glue interfaces very little. Secondly, the stability of the stave is also guaranteed under extreme thermal conditions. These conclusions are positive in terms of design, validation and preparation for integration, however the experiment cannot be said to be fully conclusive. This is due to the nature of the beam (IEL and not NIEL) used, the elevated dose rate, and the lack of precision in some measurements: stave positioning and beam calibration, dose, temperature measurements and

Figure 28: Detail view of an ionised sample after failure

heating of temperature sensors, etc. If one was to undertake such a test in the future a non-ionizing energy loss beam would have to be selected and more precision demanded in all measurements and set-ups.

The irradiation of an IBL stave in a high dose rate beta beam was an important step in the validation of the structure's mechanical interfaces. Clearly after having undergone the irradiation and the thermal effects linked to and 110 thermal cycles as well as transport, manipulation and inspections during which it was inevitably stressed, the stave remains stable and mechanically sound. Thus the experiment has helped to prove that the stave's design and the materials used are appropriate and are robust at important levels of stress, be it ionization, thermal or mechanical.
