**Abstract**

Results on the single electron reconstruction efficiency as well as the rejection capability of QCD-jets with the Atlas detector are presented. The simulation, reconstruction and analysis are done in the framework of the Data Challenge 1. This study includes the Level 1 Trigger, the Event Filter and the offline selection. It is based on fully simulated events at the initial low (\(2\times 10^{33}\,\mathrm{cm}^{-2}\ \mathrm{s}^{-1}\)) and the design high (\(10^{34}\,\mathrm{cm}^{-2}\ \mathrm{s}^{-1}\)) luminosity, on which pile-up is superimposed. For both scenarios, a jet rejection factor of \(\sim 10^{5}\) can be obtained for an electron identification efficiency \(\sim 73\%\).

Introduction

The identification of isolated high transverse momentum electrons (\(p_{T}\geq 25\) GeV/c) is essential for physics studies at the LHC. Typical examples are the searches for decays of the Higgs boson into four electrons \(H\to ZZ^{(*)}\to 4e\), with a cross section \(\sim 0.2\) fb for a Higgs mass of 130 GeV/\(c^{2}\), the production of \(Z\) with decays \(Z\to e^{+}e^{-}\) (\(\sigma\,=\,1.5\times\,10^{-6}\) mb), or the production of \(W\) with decays \(W\to e\nu\) (\(\sigma=1.5\times 10^{-5}\) mb). The QCD di-jet cross section being of the order of 1 mb, to obtain an inclusive electron signal, a rejection factor \(\sim 10^{5}\) is required on QCD jets.

Since publication of the Physics TDR analyses [1][2], the Inner Detector (ID) geometry has been significantly modified with the introduction of a realistic material description, leading to important changes in performance. At the same time, the reconstruction software has moved to the object oriented framework Athena[3]. This note describes the inclusive electron selection and the rejection capability of QCD-jets using information from the electromagnetic and hadronic calorimeters as well as the ID, with data produced for the Data Challenge 1 (DC1) [4]. For the separation of electrons from jets, discriminating variables are defined, based on both the calorimeters and the inner tracking system. Cuts on these variables are developed to maintain high electron efficiency even in the presence of pile-up. The electron identification efficiency is studied for single isolated electromagnetic clusters of \(E_{T}=25\) (30) GeV for low (high) luminosity, close to the nominal single object trigger thresholds. The jet rejection is normalised to the total number of QCD jets with \(p_{T}>17\) (25) GeV/c at low (high) luminosity, smeared and reconstructed at the particle level using Atlfast[5].

The note is organised as follows. A description of the data samples and the simulation geometry layout used is done in section 2. The trigger selection applied at the Level 1 and at the Event Filter is presented in section 3.1. The offline selection procedure is presented in 3.2. Results are presented and discussed in section 4.

## 2 Detector layout and data samples

In this note the DC1 layout is used. Details of the changes since TDR are summarised in [4]. The material budget of the ID is higher in the DC1 layout than in the TDR. Especially in the end-cap, bremsstrahlung is more pronounced, because electrons have to pass more material before reaching the calorimeters. The material increase near the beampipe is potentially more harmful because hard bremsstrahlung occuring in this region is hard to recover. In the past, the magnetic field in the ID volume has been simulated to be 2 T. In DC1, the correct field map is used. This mainly affects the shower shape variables which tend to be slightly broader than in the past. The end-caps of the calorimeter have been shifted by 4 cm to leave more space to bring out cables in the crack between barrel and end-cap cryostat. A summary of some design parameters of the electromagnetic calorimeter, that will be used later in the note, is given in Tab. 9 in annexe A.

The Monte Carlo events were generated for DC1 with Pythia 6.203 [6] under the Athena framework and stored in Root format [7]. Monte Carlo events were simulated in the ATLAS detector with GEANT 3 [8], based ATLASIM/DICE program [9], version 3.2.1. The inputs were the event kinematics from Root-format files and the output was the detector hits and digits in ZEBRA-format files. These DC1 data were reconstructed using Athena release 6.0.4. The electronic noise in the electromagnetic calorimeter is included. Pile-up is added to study these events for the low luminosity \((2\times 10^{33}\) cm\({}^{-2}\) s\({}^{-1}\)) and high luminosity (\(10^{34}\) cm\({}^{-2}\) s\({}^{-1}\)) scenarios. The number of pile-up events per bunch crossing follows a Poisson distribution with an average of 4.6 (23) at low (high) luminosity.

To evaluate the performance of the electron identification algorithm, single electrons with pseudorapidity \(|\eta|<2.5\) and \(E_{T}=25\) (30) GeV at low (high) luminosity are used. To evaluate the rejection factors QCD dijet events, including initial and final state radiation, are used. On parton level each jet is required to have a transverse momentum \(p_{T}\ \geq\ 17\) (25) GeV/c and a rapidity within \(\pm 2.7\). Detailed information about samples are given in Table 1.

In addition to QCD di-jet events, other physics processes such as prompt photon events or intermediate \(W/Z\) bosons production were added (cf. Tab. 2). Events which would not pass the LVL1 are immediatly rejected: at least one region of size \(\Delta\eta\times\Delta\phi=0.12\times 0.12\) must be found, in which the summed transverse energy of all stable particles except muons and neutrinos is at least 17 GeV. Only 8.33% (10.20%) of all generated events at low (high) luminosity are accepted and then fully simulated.

## 3 Selection criteria

### Trigger selection

The Level 1 (LVL1) electron/photon trigger includes two menu items [10]: the single object menu _em25i_ (_em30i_) and the double object menu _2em15i_ (_2em20i_). The first

* the transverse energy reconstructed in the electromagnetic calorimeter in \(1\times 2\) trigger tower (\(\Delta\ \eta\ \times\ \Delta\ \phi\ =\ 0.1\ \times\ 0.1\)) is greater than 19 (20) GeV for the single object trigger. The \(E_{T}\) thresholds for the double object trigger are 9 (16) GeV.
* the electromagnetic isolation, summed over 12 towers around the \(2\times 2\) trigger tower cluster core is less or equal than 3 (5 GeV). The thresholds for the double object trigger are 8 (4) GeV.
* the hadronic isolation, summed over 12 towers around the \(2\times 2\) trigger tower cluster core is less or equal than 2 (3 GeV). The thresholds for the double object trigger are 4 (2) GeV.
* the core of the hadronic leakage into \(2\times 2\) trigger towers behind the electromagnetic cluster is less or equal than 2 (2) GeV. The thresholds for the double object trigger are 4 (2) GeV.

In Athena release 6.0.4, the LVL2 tracking code had a problem, leading to a loss of \(\sim 4\%\) of the tracks (see [10] for more details), and therefore cannot be used. At the Event Filter (EF) level electrons are selected based on the cluster transverse energy \(E_{T}\) and shower shape quantities that distinguish isolated electromagnetic objects from jets. Selection criteria are very similar to the ones used in the offline analysis, but the thresholds are looser than in the offline analysis. The \(E_{T}\) threshold is 22 (27) GeV for the single object trigger menu and 12.5 (17) GeV for the double object trigger menu.

The performance for the single isolated electron HLT algorithms are summarised in Tab. 3 for the low and high luminosity scenarios. The trigger steps are factorised by detector in order to show the rejection that each stage contributes to the trigger. The identification efficiency for single electrons is \(\sim 78\%\). This corresponds to an efficiency of \(\sim 81\%\) with respect to the LVL1. These results are compatible with the ones reported in reference [11], taking into account the difference due to the LVL2 tracking code problem and differences in the normalisation (see section 4 for more details).

### Offline analysis

For the separation of electrons from jets, discriminating variables are defined, based on both the calorimeters and the inner tracking system. Cuts on these variables are developed to maintain high electron efficiency even in the presence of pile-up. The discriminating variables used in this study are the same as in previous studies [1][2][12]. The offline electron/jet separation procedure consists in using the calorimeter information to select events containing a high-\(E_{T}\) electromagnetic shower. Then, a good quality track is selected and required to match the electromagnetic calorimeter shower in \((\eta,\phi)\) as well as in the energy-momentum reconstruction. Finally the TRT information is used to improve the identification of electrons.

As detailed in section 2, the inclusive dijet sample includes prompt photon events, quark bremsstrahlung, \(W\), \(Z\) and top production. These events are vetoed in this analysis. A part of the dijet sample contains electrons originating from heavy flavour decays. They are also vetoed for this particular study on the determination on the rejection capability on QCD-jets of the electron identification algorithm. To reject them the following procedure is used. Events coming directly from a quark might have a small vertex radius. Thus an electron which has a radius, based on Monte Carlo truth information, smaller than 10 mm is considered as a signal one and is thus not considered in the analysis1. Results of the conversion identification package is not present in the DC1 production used in this analysis, so it is not possible to tag them correctly.

Footnote 1: An alternative method is to cut on the transverse momentum \(p_{T}\geq 16\) GeV/c and to check that this particle is not originating from a conversion. Both methods give the same results.

#### 3.2.1 Use of calorimeter information

EgammaRec is an algorithm designed to calculate quantities used to separate electrons and photons from jets. In the electromagnetic calorimeter electrons are narrow objects,

while jets tend to have a broader profile. Hence, shower shapes can be used to reject jets.

Figure 1: \(E_{T}\) _distribution of all clusters in each event after_ LVL1 _simulation in the electromagnetic calorimeter. Left figure shows events with \(E_{T}=25\) GeV electrons at low luminosity (full line) and events with \(E_{T}=30\) GeV electrons at high luminosity (dotted line). Right figure shows jets at both low and high luminosity._This is handled by the EMSShowerBuilder tool which calls a number of algorithms that calculate diverse quantities using information from the first and second samplings of the electromagnetic calorimeter, as well as the first sampling of the hadronic calorimeter.

Only electromagnetic clusters with \(E_{T}>17\) (25) GeV at low (high) at luminosity are considered in this study. Fig. 1 shows the \(E_{T}\) distributions after the LVL1 for all clusters found in the electromagnetic calorimeter. The electron sample consisting of single particles only the single object trigger is efficient. The low \(E_{T}\) clusters which are low energy particles from the pile-up events are rejected. For the jet samples, the first peak arises from the threshold of 5 GeV on the reconstruction of clusters and the second one after the application of the LVL1 which enriches the sample with events having at least one cluster above a high \(E_{T}\) threshold.

**Hadronic leakage:**

Electromagnetic showers deposit a small amount of energy in the hadronic calorimeter, typically less than 2% for electrons, either due to their low energy, as in this study, or because of the presence of the cryostat wall for more energetic electrons. The hadronic leakage is defined as the ratio of the transverse energy reconstructed in the first compartment of the hadronic calorimeter in a window \(\Delta\eta\times\Delta\phi=0.2\times 0.2\) to the transverse energy reconstructed in the electromagnetic calorimeter. This ratio is shown in Fig. 2 for electrons and jets at low luminosity.

**Use of the second compartment of the ECAL:**

Electromagnetic showers deposit most of their energy in the second sampling of the electromagnetic calorimeter. Following variables are used in the second sampling of the electromagnetic calorimeter:

* Electrons deposit most of their energy in a \(\Delta\eta\times\Delta\phi=3\times 7\) window (in units of cells). The lateral shower shape, \(R_{\eta}(37)\), is given by the ratio of the energy reconstructed in a \(3\times 7\) cluster by the energy in a \(7\times 7\) cluster. This variable

(cf. Fig. 3 on left) shows a peak near one for electrons because of the very small lateral leakage; large tails at lower values of \(R_{\eta}(37)\) for the jets are expected.
* The lateral width (cf. Fig. 3) is calculated with a window of \(3\times 5\) cells using the energy weighted sum over all cells, which depends on the particle impact point inside the cell: \(\omega_{\eta 2}=\sqrt{\frac{\sum E_{\rm e}\times\eta^{2}}{\sum E_{\rm e}}-\left( \frac{\sum E_{\rm e}\times\eta}{\sum E_{\rm e}}\right)^{2}}\).

**Use of the first compartment of the ECAL:**

Cuts applied on the variables used in the hadronic calorimeter and the second sampling of the electromagnetic calorimeters reject jets with high energetic pions and wide shower; jets with single or multiple \(\eta\), \(\pi^{0}\) etc., are now the main contribution which can fake the electrons. The first compartment with its very fine granularity in rapidity can be used to detect substructures within a shower and thus isolated \(\pi^{0}\)'s and \(\gamma\)'s can be discriminated against efficiently. The lateral shower shape in the strips is exploited when a minimal amount of energy (0.5%) is reconstructed in the strips and for \(|\eta|<2.35\) where the strips granularity is fine enough. For all first compartment criteria, two cells in \(\phi\) are summed.

* Jets with \(\pi^{0}\) decays are found to have often two maxima. The shower is studied in a window \(\Delta\eta\times\Delta\phi=0.125\times 0.2\) (cf. Fig. 4) around the hottest cell to look for a second maximum. If more than two maxima are found the second highest maximum is chosen. Two variables are used:
* the difference \(\Delta E=E_{\rm max2}-E_{\rm min}\) of the energy associated with the second maximum \(E_{\rm max2}\) and the energy reconstructed in the strip with the minimal value between the first and second maximum \(E_{\rm min}\) (see Fig. 4 on the left).
* \(\Delta E_{\rm max2}=E_{\rm max2}/(1+9(5)\times 10^{-3}E_{T})\), with \(E_{T}\) the transverse energy of the cluster in the electromagnetic calorimeter and the constant value 9 (5) refers to low (high) luminosity. To ensure not to be sensitive to fluctuations, the value

The distributions are shown for jets (empty histogram) and electrons (full histogram) at low luminosity. Only the LVL1 trigger is applied beforehand. The distributions are normalised to unit area._

of the second maximal energy deposit has to be greater than a threshold2 which depends linearly on the transverse energy (see Fig. 4 on the right). Footnote 2: In the reference [2] the dependency with \(E_{T}\) was \(1+9(5)\times 10^{-4}E_{T}\). This analysis uses the value defined in Atrecon and Athena codes as well as at the Event Filter level.
* The total shower width is determined in a window \(\Delta\eta\times\Delta\phi=0.0625\times\ 0.2\), corresponding typically to 40 strips in \(\eta\) (see granularity in Tab. 9). It is calculated from: \(\omega_{tot1}\ =\ \sqrt{\sum E_{i}\times\left(i-i_{max}\right)^{2}/\sum E_{i}}\), where \(i\) is the strip number and \(i_{max}\) the strip number of the first local maximum. This width is shown for electrons and jets in Fig. 5. After these cuts only very narrow showers with one reconstructed maximum remain. The two following variables are used for a fine study of the shower shape:
* \(F_{\text{side}}\) giving the shower shape in the shower core is shown in Fig. 6 on the left. It is calculated with the following formula: \(F_{\text{side}}=\left[E(\pm 3)-E(\pm 1)\right]/E(\pm 1)\), where \(E(\pm n)\) is the energy in \(\pm\ n\) strips around the strip with highest energy.
* The shower width using three strips around the one with the maximal energy deposit is shown in Fig. 6 on the right. It is given by the following formula: \(\omega_{3\text{stfips}}=\sqrt{\sum E_{i}\times\left(i-i_{max}\right)^{2}/\sum E _{i}}\), where \(i\) is the number of the strip and \(i_{max}\) the strip number of the most energetic one. This variable can help for some particular \(\eta\) bins.

Fig. 7 shows the average values of the calorimeter-based discriminating variables used for electron/jet separation as a function of the pseudo-rapidity. Since these variables are pseudorapidity dependent, the threshold values are tuned in several intervals. These subdivision is motivated by the varying granularities, lead thickness and material in front of the electromagnetic calorimeter. The first two bins, (0;0.8) and (0.8;1.37),

Figure 4: _Left: Difference \(\Delta E\) of the energy of the second maximum \(E_{\text{max}2}\) and the energy reconstructed in the strip with the minimal value between the first and second maximum (\(E_{\text{min}}\)). Right: \(\Delta E_{\text{max}2}\). The distributions are shown for jets (empty histogram) and electrons (full histogram) at low luminosity. Only the LV L1 trigger is applied beforehand. The distributions are normalised to unit area._

cover the barrel of the electromagnetic calorimeter. The crack in the calorimeters between \(1.37~{}<~{}|\eta|<1.52\) is excluded from the analysis. In the end-caps, the intervals are (1.52;1.8), (1.8;2.0), (2.0;2.35) and (2.35;2.47), essentially determined by the varying granularity in the first sampling (cf. Tab. 9). The quantities calculated using the first compartment can be used only in the regions \(|\eta|<1.37\) and \(1.52<|\eta|<2.35\) since outside these regions the granularity in the first compartment is (too) coarse.

The cuts on the variables are tuned to obtain an efficiency of about 95%, independent of the pseudorapidity \(\eta\), with respect to the LV L1. Thresholds are defined to be as

The double peak structure for electrons reflects the varying granularity in the end-caps of the electromagnetic calorimeter. The distributions are shown for jets (empty histogram) and electrons (full histogram) at low luminosity. Only the LV L1 trigger is applied beforehand. The distributions are normalised to unit area._

close as possible to the edge of the electron distributions. Thus there is not a big loss of efficiency compared to the EF level, but the gain in rejection of jets will be important (about a factor 10). In some cases, like for \(\omega_{\rm 3strips}\), the EF cuts are kept. Variables being highly correlated other tunings would be possible. At high luminosity, electromagnetic showers are broader and cuts thresholds are slightly looser in that case. The samples at high luminosity correspond also to higher energies. For the interval \(2.35<|\eta|\leq 2.47\), as strip variables are not used, tighter cuts are defined to the other variables to maintain a constant efficiency as a function of \(\eta\). Table 4 shows the thresholds of the cuts applied at calorimeters level at low and high luminosity.

#### 3.2.2 Use of Inner Detector information

After the calorimeter cuts, the contamination of the inclusive signal from charged hadrons is greatly reduced. The remaining background is dominated by photon conversion and low multiplicity jets containing high-\(p_{T}\)\(\pi^{0}\) mesons. It can be reduced further by requiring

Figure 7: _Distributions of the mean of each calorimetric discriminating variable as a function of the pseudo-rapidity \(|\eta|\) for single electrons at \(E_{T}=25\) GeV._

the presence of a good quality track pointing to an electromagnetic cluster with a good energy-momentum match.

Cluster and track information are combined in the EMTrackMatchBuilder of the geammaRec algorithm. Tracks are reconstructed with xKalman++. Only tracks with \(p_{T}>5\) GeV/c are kept. An angular matching is done in a window \(\Delta\eta=\pm 0.05\), \(\Delta\phi=\pm 0.1\) between the selected electromagnetic clusters and the position of the track extrapolated to the calorimeter. In case more than one track is found, the one with the highest \(p_{T}\) is retained. If the \(E/p\) ratio is less than 4, the track matching is successful. In the subsequent particle identification step the information provided by geammaRec can be used. A set of track quality cuts are at first applied, referred as ID-cuts:

* at least nine precision hits (Pixel+SCT);
* at least two hits in the pixels, one of which being in the b-layer;
* a transverse impact parameter \(|A_{0}|<0.1\) cm.

#### 3.2.3 Use of the Inner Detector/calorimeter matching information

The jet rejection can be significantly improved by ensuring consistency between the electromagnetic calorimeter and the Inner Detector information. First, the angular matching between the track and the electromagnetic cluster is checked (cf. Fig. 8):

* \(|\Delta\eta|=|\eta_{\rm cluster}^{\rm strips}-\eta_{\rm ID}|\), where \(\eta_{\rm cluster}^{\rm strips}\) is computed in the first sampling of the electromagnetic calorimeter, where the granularity is very fine, and \(\eta_{\rm ID}\) is the pseudorapidity of the track extrapolated to the calorimeter;
* \(|\Delta\phi|=|\phi_{\rm cluster}^{\rm middle}-\phi_{\rm ID}|\), where \(\phi_{\rm cluster}^{\rm middle}\) is computed in the second compartment of the electromagnetic calorimeter and \(\phi_{\rm ID}\) is the azimuth of the track extrapolated to the calorimeter;

Subsequently, the energy \(E\) measured in the electromagnetic calorimeter is compared to the momentum \(p\) measured in the Inner Detector (cf. Fig. 9 on the left). In the case

Still, large tails at low and high values of the ratio can be seen. These are due to conversion electrons as well as soft bremsstrahlung.

Table 5 details the thresholds applied for each \(\eta\) bin. Typically at low energy, it is required that \(0.9<E/p<2.5\) in the barrel and \(0.9<E/p<3.5\) in the end-cap.

#### 3.2.4 Use of transition radiation in the TRT information

A further reduction of the charged hadron contamination is obtained by rejecting tracks having a low fraction of high-threshold TR hits. Fig. 9 (right) shows the ratio \(N_{\rm TR}/N_{\rm straw}\) between the number of high threshold hits \(N_{\rm TR}\) and the total number of TRT hits \(N_{\rm straw}\). Thresholds applied at the TRT level for TDR analysis were defined in \(p_{T}\) and \(\eta\) bins [2] but are not tuned for DC1 analysis. Thus, the thresholds applied at the TRT level are the ones defined at the EF level and shown in Tab. 5. They are tuned to obtain \(\sim 90\%\) electron efficiency at low and high luminosity on tracks which pass the LVL1 and track quality cuts.

## 4 Performance of the algorithm

### Electron identification

The identification of a candidate cluster/track as originating from a signal electron is based on the sequence of criteria described above. The total identification efficiency \(\varepsilon_{e}\) is defined as:

\[\varepsilon_{e}=\frac{N_{e}^{t}}{N_{e}}, \tag{1}\]

where \(N_{e}\) is the number of electron particles, from the Monte Carlo truth block of the combined ntuple, with \(p_{T}>5\) GeV/c and a angular matching in a window \(\Delta\eta=\pm 0.05\)

The distributions are shown for jets (empty histogram) and electrons (full histogram) at low luminosity. Only the LVL1 trigger is applied beforehand. The distributions are normalised to unit area._

electrons at low luminosity and \(\sim 71\%\) for 30 GeV electrons at high luminosity.

### Jet rejection

The normalisation of the rejection is done with respect to the number of jets above 17 (25) GeV at low (high) luminosity. The jets are reconstructed with the fast simulation program ATLFAST. The files used in this analysis are not complete as they passed the particle filter described in section 2. A total of \(N_{i}=1120360\) (\(441615\)) events at low (high) luminosity are present after particle filter, corresponding to a fraction of \(\varepsilon_{f}=8.33\%\) (\(10.20\%\)) of all generated events. The true number of initial events is then \(N_{i}/\varepsilon_{f}\). The number of initial jets \(N_{i\text{ets}}\) is determined on a subset of events and are summarised in Tab. 7. These numbers are based on the study of \(N_{tot}=2\times 10^{6}\) (\(6\times 10^{5}\)) dijet events at low (high) luminosity, before particle level filtering [13]. The normalisation factor is then \(N_{\text{jets}}/N_{\text{tot}}\). The total number of initial jets used in this study is thus given by : \(N_{jet}^{\text{i}}=\frac{N_{i}\times N_{\text{jets}}}{\varepsilon_{f}\times N_{ \text{tot}}}\). The rejection factor \(R\)(jet) of QCD-jets is defined by the ratio of initial jets \(N_{jet}^{\text{\it{jet}}}\) over the number of mis-identified jets \(N_{jet}^{\text{\it{res}}}\) :

\[R\text{(jet)}=\frac{N_{jet}^{\text{i}}}{N_{jet}^{\text{\it{res}}}}. \tag{2}\]

Tab. 8 shows the rejection factors of QCD jets obtained after each step of the analysis at low and high luminosity. The offline steps are factorised by detector in order to show the rejection that each stage contributes to the analysis. The marginal effect of all cuts has been also checked.

The rejection after the Calo level is \(\sim 3000\pm 60\) at low luminosity. After all cuts, the rejection is \(222\times 10^{3}\), with only 33 clusters remaining. It is higher in the barrel, where only 7 clusters remain, which is reflected in the high uncertainty, than in the end-caps, where 26 clusters remain. This difference can be understood by looking at the distribution of

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|} \hline \(\varepsilon_{e}\) (in \%) & low luminosity & high luminosity \\ \hline LVL1 & \(95.8\pm 0.3\) & \(95.9\pm 0.2\) \\ \hline Calo & \(91.2\pm 0.4\) & \(90.0\pm 0.3\) \\ \hline ID & \(81.3\pm 0.5\) & \(78.7\pm 0.4\) \\ \hline ID-Calo & \(76.4\pm 0.6\) & \(73.0\pm 0.4\) \\ \hline TRT & \(73.5\pm 0.6\) & \(71.3\pm 0.4\) \\ \hline \end{tabular}

This variable shows very large tails for electrons due to conversion electrons and soft bremsstrahlung. 7 of the remaining candidates have a transverse energy lower than 22 GeV, _i.e_ are selected only by the double trigger menu. Among the remaining candidates 23 are electrons originating from photon conversion. Half of these conversions are highly asymmetric, _i.e_ the member of the \(e^{+}e^{-}\) pair which is selected by the algorithm carries the largest part of the transverse momentum. The other member is an electron track with a small (few GeV/c) transverse momentum. These conversions will be hard to reconstruct. 5 events are hadrons (2 \(\pi^{+}\), 1 \(\pi^{-}\) and 2 \(K^{+}\)) which carry more than 33% of the cluster energy. The remaining event is due to a collection of hadronic tracks, none of them being the leading one.

Rejection at high luminosity is \((71\pm 12)\times 10^{3}\), corresponding to 35 events. Among them 13 are originating from conversions (half of them being highly asymmetric), the rest being charged hadrons.

The crack in the electromagnetic calorimeter, between \(1.37<|\eta|<1.52\), is not taken into account._In reference [2] a rejection factor \(>150\times 10^{3}\) at 90% confidence level was obtained for a 20 GeV electron identification efficiency of 68.5% and a 30 GeV electron identification efficiency of 72.7%. It was estimated based on the study of \(10^{6}\) dijets, among which only one survived. In reference [2] the low luminosity was \(10^{33}\) cm\({}^{-2}\) s\({}^{-1}\), that is half of the one considered now and there was no pile-up, so less noise in the ID and the calorimeters. One of the main difference with the presented analysis is the \(E_{T}\) thresholds used at the EF for single object trigger menus. It increases from 17 GeV to 22 GeV at low luminosity, and from 25 GeV to 27 GeV at high luminosity. In this analysis looser cuts are also used, often the same thresholds as in the Event Filter. The electron identification efficiency is \(\sim 79\%\). In reference [2] a better quality of TRT track (number of TRT hits \(\geq 20\)) was introduced. This cut is found not to be useful. It does not reject further clusters at low luminosity and only 3 at high luminosity. On the other hand it lowers electron identification efficiencies by \(\sim 5\%\). The rejection of QCD jets remains of the order of \(10^{5}\) in agreement with what is required.

### Cross-check of performance

The electron identification efficiency is cross-checked with the signal electrons in the inclusive jet sample. Since the fraction of events with electrons in the sample is very small, the statistical errors are large. For electrons coming from \(W/Z\) decays, the efficiency is \(69\pm 5\%\) (\(68\pm 6\%\)). It corresponds to 43 \(W\)'s decaying semileptonically at low luminosity. The QCD background to this signal is initially \(\sim 10^{5}\) higher. As described in previous section, after the application of the electron identification algorithm, only 33 clusters are mis-identified as electrons. The purity, defined as the number of signal events divided by the total numer of selected events, of the electron sample from \(W\)'s is thus after the analysis \(\sim\) 0.6.

The application of the selection criteria to electrons coming from \(b\) and \(c\) semi-leptonic decays consists of 46 (25) events at low (high) luminosity. It corresponds to an efficiency of \(4.4\pm 0.6\%\) (\(3.8\pm 0.7\%\)) at low (high) luminosity. The efficiency is much lower than the nominal 80% as these electrons are in general not isolated and possibly soft, and so they do not pass the LVL1. The efficiencies, normalised to the number of events passing the LVL1, is \(54\pm 7\%\).

## 5 Conclusion

In this note the electron/jet separation power of the Atlas detector is determined on fully simulated data with DC1 layout.

As far as possible the same thresholds as at the Event Filter are applied. In particular no tuning on \(E/p\) or TRT cuts are performed. This study shows that even with such loose cuts it is possible to achieve a rejection on QCD jets of the order of \(10^{5}\) while maintaining an overall efficiency of about 73%, close to the target of the Event Filter itself. At low luminosity, the remaining background from the QCD di-jet sample is essentially irreducible, formed of electrons from photon conversions. A large part of these conversions, being highly asymmetric, are found to be hard to identify. At high luminosity, the reducible background, formed of charged hadronic tracks, is dominating.

Identification efficiency and rejection factors

Table 10 details results on the electron identification efficiency for various \(\eta\) bins. Cuts are tuned at the Calo level to obtain an efficiency \(\sim 95\%\) with respect to the LVL1. At high luminosity, the efficiency is only \(88.7\%\) for events with \(0.80~{}<~{}|\eta|\leq 1.37\) when applying the Calo level. It is thus lower than \(\sim 91\%\) which would correspond to \(\sim 95\%\) with respect to the LVL1. The drop of efficiency is due to the cut \(E_{T}>27\) GeV.

At high luminosity, the efficiency is only \(60.5\%\) for events with \(2.35<|\eta|\leq 2.47\) when applying the ID-Calo matching cuts. The thresholds are the ones defined at the EF level.

Finally it should be noted that \(\sim 2\%\) of the electron sample pass the offline selection criteria but not the LVL1. For these events, the vast majority has no Region of Interest associated.
