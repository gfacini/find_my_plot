**1) Forming the MODULE Design and Engineering Team**

It is time to make a close collaboration between the engineers (and related physicists) in the institutes to unify SCT engineering for the module development. Ideally, we should achieve very good communications, and work within a single SCT project. Below is the list of engineers so far identified. Please contact the convenors if you or your institute have engineers who are able to contribute in this field.

We would propose that Geoff Tappern leads the engineering team. To aid smooth communications within project clusters we identify the contacts in each. The most reliable method of the communication is via FAX (for the moment). However, we also request to produce electrical form as much as possible so that the information can be posted on the WWW (Y. Unno is maintaining the SCT module page in the atlasinfo.cern.ch machine.)2) Module work programme 96 (BARREL)

**2.1) The modules**

The module concepts, "end-tap" and "centre-tap", have variants of cooling schemes (2 pipes or 1 pipes) and heat conductors (Beryllia or PG(Pyrolytic Graphite)). In the case of 2 cooling pipes, Beryllia would suffice the cooling job, while PG would be required to cool with sigle cooling pipe. In order to reduce the number of combinations, the following modules will be engineered:

**(a) End-tap module**

**(a.1) Beryllia and 2 cooling pipes**

**(a.2) PG and 1 cooling pipe**

**(b) Centre-tap module**

**(b.1) Beryllia and 2 cooling pipes**

**(b.2) PG and 1 cooling pipe**

The support scheme would be conceptually the same for both end-tap and centre-tap modules, but would be expected to be (slightly) different in details when fully engineered.

**2.2) Milestones**

The primary goal of the programme is to reach the decision on the final SCT barrel module at the December 96 review meeting. In order to come to this decision, we require design, prototyping, FEA analysis, and measurement. The following list gives the general milestones:

**Noise measurement (end-tap, centre-tap, Z)**

**Understanding of the noise with simulation**

**Design & Engineering of module**

**Thermal FEA (static and runaway)**

**Construction of thermal module**

**Measurement of the thermal modules**

**Thermo-mechanical distortion FEA**

**Measurement of Distortion**

**Dec. 96**Construction of electrically working module

**Design & Engineering of the supports**

Prototyping the supports

Evaluation of assembly procedure, rad length

**Note:**

(1) Thermal static FEA: cross-check by T.Kondo(KEK) and W.Miller (Hytech/UCSC)

(2) "Simple module" is just a mechanical module to learn feasibility. "Bonded module" is the module with wire bonding to learn construction technique in which the wire-bonding is the critical one. "Thermal module" is the module which has heaters inbeded and to measure (static) thermal properties.

(3) The proposed "job sharing" is to encourage interchange of module items, and ultimately modules, between groups who share in the fabrication of components. One such example is the proposal that RAL fabricates BeO components, while KEK fabricates Al-metalized dummy detectors for thermal modules (numbers are all subject to the cost).

(4) All hybrids are for the current chip set: LBIC bipolar + CDP CMOS-buffer + HAC communication chips. BeO hybrid is with thin (3 micron) Gold on BeO substrate. LBL has AlN hybrid for the current chip set for evaluation of the irradiated detectors and modules for this Summer, and wishes to fabricate a double-sided AlN hybrid for the next chip set of CAFE + ABC's next year.

### 3.1) The modules

There are currently three possibilities for the forward module. The first two modules are of the end-tap variety. One design using single sided detectors is being developed in the UK while a second design using double sided silicon detectors has been proposed by Munich. Finally the centre-tap R-phi module as developed for the barrel remains a possibility if this concept becomes the adopted solution in the barrel.

**a) Module using single sided detectors**

* The module will use Hamamatsu fan geometry detectors to make a stereo module.
* The module uses a BeO hybrid with thin gold tracks. The cooling spine will initially be BeO but may be upgraded to PG when the viability of the material has been demonstrated. The module is designed for binary readout. The aim is to use one connection to the cooling pipe.

**b) Module using double sided detectors**

* This module relies on a PG frame for support and cooling.
* The hybrid proposed uses aluminium on AlN.
* The module is designed for analogue readout.
* The aim is to connect the module to the cooling pipe at a single point.

**c) R-phi centre-tap module**

* This module will use Hamamatsu fan geometry detectors with the appropriate barrel binary hybrids.

### 3.2) Milestones

The primary goal of the programme is to reach the decision on the final SCT barrel module at the December 96 review meeting. In order to come to this decision, we require design, prototyping, FEA analysis, and measurement. For the forward region the added problem of non-uniform irradiation needs to be considered when studying thermal runaway. The following list gives the general milestones:

**Delivery of first full scale wedge detectors**

**Evaluation of Hamamatsu detectors in H8**

**Noise measurement**

**Design & Engineering of module**

**3.3) Work sharing**

The following is a suggestion from the convenors for the work sharing, amongst the institutes and individuals who are personally known to us. Please let us know if others are wishing to contribute, and if the suggested people are willing and able to take on the proposed commitments.

The forward module programme has many items in common with the barrel programme such as the centre-tap R-phi module and the noise simulation. Accordingly some of the relevant studies will not be repeated but results will be taken from the work in the barrel.
