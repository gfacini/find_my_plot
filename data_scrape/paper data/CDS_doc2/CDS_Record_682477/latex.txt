###### Abstract

Previous results for the prospects of \(\rm B^{0}_{s}\) mixing measurement in the ATLAS experiment at LHC are updated. The improved analysis method of the studied decay channels \(\rm B^{0}_{s}\to D^{-}_{s}\pi^{+}\) and \(\rm B^{0}_{s}\to D^{-}_{s}a^{+}_{1}\), combined with most recent values for the branching ratios and the \(\rm B^{0}_{s}\) lifetime, leads to the new ATLAS sensitivity range for the \(x_{s}\) measurement: \(x_{s}^{max}=42\). An extensive study is done in order to estimate how \(x_{s}^{max}\) is influenced by the B-decay proper-time resolution of the vertex detector, as well as by the number of events and by the signal-to-background ratio.

## 1 Measurement of \(x_{s}\)

CP-violation in B-meson decays can be characterized by the unitarity triangle, composed of Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa matrix elements by requiring that the matrix is unitary. In addition to the angles of the unitarity triangle, measurements of the lengths of the sides provide us with complementary information about the triangle. The length of the side \(|V_{td}|\) is least well-known of the sides. The mixing parameter \(x_{\rm d}\) is proportional to \(|V_{td}|^{2}\), but inferring the value of \(|V_{td}|^{2}\) from \(x_{\rm d}\) is hampered by hadronic uncertainties. To large extent, these uncertainties cancel, when considering the ratio of the mixing parameters, \(x_{\rm s}/x_{\rm d}\propto|V_{ts}/V_{td}|^{2}\).

The mixing parameter \(x_{\rm s}\) has not been measured yet. The Standard Model predicts it to be in the range 10-30, and the present lower limit from LEP is \(x_{\rm s}>11.1\)[1].

Principles of the \(x_{s}\) measurement are described in previous notes [2, 3]. A time-dependent asymmetry \(A(t)\), observed in the experiment, is defined as:

\[A(t)=\frac{dn(++)/dt-dn(+-)/dt}{dn(++)/dt+dn(+-)/dt}=D\cos(x_{s}t/\tau_{B_{s}}) \tag{1}\]where \((++)\) refers to B-decays in which the flavour of the B appears to be the same in the production and decay, \((+-)\) refers to cases where an oscillation of the B into its anti-particle is observed, and \(t\) is the proper time. \(D\) is a product of all the dilution factors:

\[D = D_{tag}D_{back}D_{time} \tag{2}\]

\[D_{tag} = 1-2W \tag{3}\] \[D_{back} = \frac{N_{S}}{N_{S}+N_{B}}\] (4) \[D_{time} = \exp{(-\frac{1}{2}(\frac{\sigma_{t}x_{s}}{\tau})^{2})} \tag{5}\]

where \(W\) is the wrong tag fraction, \(N_{S}\) is the number of signal events, \(N_{B}\) is the number of background events1, \(\sigma_{t}\) is the proper time resolution and \(\tau\) is the B\({}_{\rm s}^{0}\) lifetime. Formula 5 can be obtained using Fourier transforms [4].

Footnote 1: It is assumed for the formula 1 that background \(dN_{B}/dt\sim exp(-t/\tau)\), with no asymmetry.

In case of ATLAS \(W=0.22\)[5] and \(N_{B}=N_{S}\) is assumed (section 2.1). The lifetime of the B\({}_{\rm s}^{0}\) is assumed to be \(\tau=1.61\) ps after [6]. Figure 1 shows the total dilution factor \(D\) estimated with the above assumptions for different values of the proper-time resolution (\(\sigma_{t}=0.05\), 0.07, 0.09 and 0.11 ps), as a function of \(x_{s}\). The amplitude of the cosine wave which can be observed by the experiment is reduced

results, which were produced later, and which are in a good agreement with the latter value.

Replacing the strip 'B-physics' layer at \(R=6\) cm with a third pixel layer at \(R=4\) cm gives slightly worse performance, \(\sigma_{t}=0.068\) to 0.094 ps, depending on the resolution assumed for pixels [7]. Removal of the 'B-physics' layer, with the first tracking layer made of pixels at \(R=11\) cm, results in \(\sigma_{t}=0.146\) to 0.154 ps.

A value of \(\sigma_{t}=0.07\) ps, well justified by the result from [2], which is the only one so far using full simulation, is assumed in this section. In section 3 the work is repeated for values of \(\sigma_{t}\) ranging from 0.05 to 0.011 ps.

A parameter of importance which was also updated for this work is the \(\rm B^{0}_{s}\) lifetime. An up to date value \(\tau=1.61\) ps used here is higher than in case of previous presentations (\(\tau=1.54\) ps, [8]), adding to an increase of the predictions for \(x_{s}^{max}\).

### Procedure of defining the range

The number of signal events \(N_{S}\), the number of background events \(N_{B}\) and the proper-time resolution \(\sigma_{t}\) are used as parameters in a Monte-Carlo program, which generates "experimental" distribution of the "measured" asymmetry \(A(t)\). The distribution then has \(D_{back}\), \(D_{time}\) and Poisson fluctuations introduced with Monte-Carlo methods. Dilution from wrong tags \(D_{tag}\) is also introduced, with the wrong tag fraction \(W=0.22\)[5]. Finally, the program generates \(A(t)\) distributions for \(t>0.4\) ps because of the analysis cut listed in tables 1 and 2.

Resulting 'experimental' \(A(t)\) distribution is analyzed with a method called the amplitude fit, recommended in [4]. \(A(t)\) distribution is fitted with the function

\(A_{fit}\cos(x_{s}t/\tau)\), where \(x_{s}\) is a constant value and \(A_{fit}\) is the only free parameter. The fit is repeated for different values of \(x_{s}\), giving an \(A_{fit}(x_{s})\) distribution.

The amplitude fit method can be described as a variant of the Fourier transformation, a 'cosine transformation'. It has the power of Fourier analysis for the periodical signals, but one introduces known information about the phase in addition - we are looking explicitly for a cosine wave in the \(A(t)\) distribution.

Figure 2 shows the properties of the transformation. An average fitted amplitude is shown as a function of \(x_{s}\) after 1000 experiments which had the true \(x_{s}=42\). An average \(\chi^{2}\) value of the fit is also shown as a function of \(x_{s}\) and the error bars show the RMS calculated from 1000 'experiments'. It can be observed, that \(A_{fit}(x_{s})\) is more useful to find the true value of the oscillation frequency.

The value of \(x_{s}\) giving the highest \(A_{fit}\) is the \(x_{s}\) measurement of the experiment. The peak in the fitted amplitude has its natural width, which can be seen in Fig. 2 (more explanation can be found in [4]). An experiment is called'successful' here when the measured \(x_{s}\) value is within that width from the 'true' value defined in the Monte-Carlo.

Figure 2: An average fitted amplitude \(A(x_{s})\) (left) and an average \(\chi^{2}\) of the fit (right), both as a function of \(x_{s}\), from 1000 experiments. The error bars show the RMS.

With increasing 'true \(x_{s}\)' the amplitude of the oscillation seen in the \(A(t)\) distribution decreases, as shown in figure 1. When a limit is passed the amplitude fit no longer enables to distinguish the right oscillation frequency form the noise generated by the statistical fluctuations in bins.

The probability of the experiment success calculated from 1000 simulated 'experiments' is shown in figure 3 as a function of \(x_{s}\). The limit \(x_{s}^{max}\) is defined as the highest value of \(x_{s}\) for which such probability of an experimental success is above 95%.

For ATLAS, with the parameters listed in section 2.1 the limit turns out to be \(x_{s}^{max}=42\). A time-dependent asymmetry distribution, its transformation with the amplitude fit procedure and the results of 1000 simulated experiments are shown in Fig.4.

For the correct frequency an average amplitude should be equal to the product of all dilution factors \(D\) (see formula 1). Figure 5 shows the distribution of the fitted amplitudes. An average value \((53.15\pm 0.49)\cdot 10^{-3}\) is in agreement with the prediction from formulas 2 to 5 equal \(D=52.85\cdot 10^{-3}\).

## 4 Dependence on signal-to-background ratio

The scan of parameters \(\sigma_{t}\) and \(\int Ldt\) described in the previous section was done for the background-to-signal ratio of 1. By increasing the number of background events such that \(N_{S}/(N_{B}+N_{S})\) becomes equal 0.1 we reduce \(x_{s}^{max}\) to 31 for the 'nominal' parameters \(\sigma_{t}=0.07\) ps and \(\int Ldt=10^{4}\) pb\({}^{-1}\) (see figure 11).

A summary plot showing the dependence of \(x_{s}^{max}\) on background is shown in figure 12. \(N_{S}\) was kept constant at its predicted value for \(\int Ldt=10^{4}\) pb\({}^{-1}\) (\(N_{S}=4480\), see section 2.1), while the number of background event was varied between \(N_{B}=0\) and \(N_{B}=9\times N_{S}\). It can be observed, that the dependence of \(x_{s}^{max}\) on background

is not strong. It should be noted however, that background had no asymmetry in the simulation and a simple exponential dependence \(dN_{B}/dt\sim\exp(-t/\tau)\) was assumed.

The points come from Monte-Carlo calculations, the solid lines show the \(x_{s}^{max}\simeq(2.90/\sigma_{t})\cdot(1+0.15\ln(\int Ldt))\) parametrisation, where \(\sigma_{t}\) is in ps and \(\int Ldt\) is in units of \(10^{4}\) pb\({}^{-1}\).

Conclusions

It is justified theoretically, after [4], that the sensitivity range \(x_{s}^{max}\) is proportional to \(1/\sigma_{t}\) (where \(\sigma_{t}\) is the resolution in the B-decay proper time), for any given integrated luminosity and signal-to-background ratio, independently of the method of defining the sensitivity range.

With the methods described in section 2 it is found that \(x_{s}^{max}=42\) for nominal ATLAS parameters. The Monte-Carlo study done for various integrated luminosities and for different \(\sigma_{t}\) values shows, that ATLAS sensitivity range can be parameterized as \(x_{s}^{max}\simeq(2.90/\sigma_{t})\cdot(1+0.15\ln(\int Ldt))\), where \(\sigma_{t}\) is in ps and \(\int Ldt\) is in units of \(10^{4}\) pb\({}^{-1}\). It is also found, that the dependence of \(x_{s}^{max}\) on background is relatively weak.
