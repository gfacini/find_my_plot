## Introduction

In view of the new LHC schedule, delays in civil engineering, and the fact that not all parts of ATLAS can be ready for the first beam various modifications to the installation schedule have been implemented [1]. In this connection with it the following questions are raised [2]:

\(\bullet\)  "Would it be possible to do the field tests with just one calorimeter in position?

\(\bullet\)   Are the shield disks really necessary for the field test of the solenoid?

### Problem formulation

Considering what was said above, there are several questions to answer:

\(\bullet\)   What would be distortion in the field seen on the left side of the inner detector cavity if the extended barrel on the other side is not there?

\(\bullet\)   In that case do we have a problem of forces for the tile when the magnets are turned on?

\(\bullet\)   What would be distortion in the field in the inner detector cavity if one or both of the shielding disks are not there when we start?

We need to understand all these differences at the scale of the precision of the field knowledge in the inner detector. All these calculations should be done for the toroidal coils (BT and ECTs) on or off.

Concerning the required precision of the field knowledge in the InDet one can quote [3]: "In order to do high precision physics with the inner tracking detector we will need to know the magnetic field of the solenoid to 0.05%. There is no point in knowing the magnetic field much better than 1 part in 1000. In order to give ourselves a little headroom, we choose the requirement that the final magnetic field map should be accurate to 1 part in 2000".

In [4] it was assumed that "a reliable knowledge of the ID magnetic field in three dimensions with overall scale correct to 0.1% and local errors less than 0.3% must be available before ATLAS starts taking data".

Geometrical boundaries of the region under consideration are as follows: "the ATLAS inner detector (ID) volume instrumented with tracking detectors has a radius of 1.05 m and half length of 3.4 m" [4].

### Computer model

3D magnetic field simulation by the Opera3D code for symmetrical (standard Atlas model) and asymmetrical (simplified TileCal iron) system structures is used. The computer model to get the field in the InDet volume is complicated by a lack of symmetry along Z-axis (beam line, Figure 1). But still some assumptions in the description of the magnetic system of the detector are probably tolerable, since it is only the InDet field that is under question.

Since all the coils are on, a \(\Delta\varphi\)=45\({}^{\circ}\) angular region around the Z-axis has to be considered as a problem volume. The planes \(\varphi\)=45\({}^{\circ}\) and \(\varphi\)=90\({}^{\circ}\) are connected by a periodicity conditionwith the scalar potential being equal at the corresponding points of the planes. The justification for this type of boundary condition is the relation \(\int\left(\vec{H}\cdot d\vec{l}\ \right)=0\), which is valid for every pair of the above corresponding points in the planes. In this relation "H" is the field strength vector and "dl" is differential length vector along an arbitrary path between the corresponding points.

The basic idea is to produce a dedicated TOSCA model and then to insert a series of structure asymmetries to monitor the perturbation effect on the basic field map.

The basic (i.e. symmetrical) model of the field in the InDet is obtained with the influence of the field contribution from some of the TileCal structure details (front and end plates, girder fine structure, plugs, active zone fine structure etc) being neglected. For example, the TileCal active zone is presented by a laminated material with the plane of lamination normal to the Z-axis and a packing factor = 0.76. These assumptions are checked in the following section. The application of the model saves considerable computer time compared to the standard ATLAS model [5]. It takes just half an hour to get meaningful results compared to several hours for the standard model.

### Basic field map

**Case-1** : This is the baseline setup with all calorimeters, shielding disks and all coils on. This calculation serves as a reference for all other cases.

The basic model structure is presented in Figure 1 + Figure 3 and Figure 7. For clarity, other TileCal iron period is removed in Figure 2. The BT coils are not shown in these figures (except Figure 1). The corresponding InDet field maps are given in Figure 2, Figure 4, Figure 6 and Figure 8.

To check the validity of the model developed for the field map calculations inside the inner detector, the present results are compared with the existing standard ATLAS magnet computer model (Figure 5 and Figure 6, upper part). One can see that the results of the calculations are close to each other. The maximum relative difference between two models is of the order of 12\(\times\)10\({}^{-4}\) and is rapidly decreasing with increasing number of nodes in the computer model. This difference is lager than the desirable accuracy of the field knowledge in the InDet (5\(\times\)10\({}^{-4}\)). But we are mainly interested in small differences between simulations under different conditions. We would not be worried about a systematic bias, which affects all simulations in the same way. Besides, there is still the possibility with 400,000 FE nodes by OPERA3D to represent additional TileCal iron geometry details into the given model, increasing further the obtained similarity between the given and the standard magnet model maps. So far, a rather small number of nodes was used (\(<\)25,000) for the model construction.

Another check of the model was performed by comparing the left-half InDet map with the right-half part of it (Figure 6, lower part). Here "left-side" denotation implies all observation points with the Z \(<\) 0 and the "right-side" stands for Z \(>\) 0 volume in the given system of co-ordinates. This comparison could be done for some arbitrary \(\varphi\) = constant plane, since in the near solenoid region up to TileCal iron the field pattern is mostly determined by the solenoid contribution (Figure 7). Calculations show that the InDet magnetic field in the ideal symmetrical system is independent of azimuth \(\varphi\) to the level below the tolerance for the field knowledge (Figure 8). The finite element (FE) structure is clearly visible in this figure. Certainly, the \(\varphi\)-symmetry breaking factors, listed in [3], are not included into the given computer model.

Summarising the above said one can conclude that the model developed describes accurately enough the InDet field with a minimum computer time spent for calculations.

### Field distortion due to the structure symmetry breaking

We have considered 4 possible scenarios:

**Case-2** : Calorimeter endcap, Tile, LAr and shielding disk are missing on side C.

To answer the questions posed in "Problem formulation" the asymmetrical ATLAS computer model was constructed with all coils on and a missing right-side TileCal Extended Barrel (EB) and shielding disk (Figure 9). The corresponding field deviation from the symmetrical map is shown in Figure 10. As iron is removed from the right side of the structure, the flux line density decreases there. This effect induces a negative field gradient along the Z-axis from left to right with the maximum impact at the end of the right side (\(\sim\) 80mT) and the minimum effect at the end of the left side (Figure 10, upper part). The maximal effect is at the level of 10\(\times\)10\({}^{-4}\), which might be marginal for our purposes.

**Case-3**: No Calorimeter on side C, shielding disk C is in optimal position.

The previous [4] requirements for the field knowledge accuracy in the ID was 10\(\times\)10\({}^{-4}\). The left-side ID field with the missing EB and disk would satisfy this requirement. But presently [3], the accuracy of the field knowledge became 5\(\times\)10\({}^{-4}\). To compensate the induced field gradient along the Z-axis the shielding disk in the right side of the system could be moved in to the appropriate Z-position. This will pull the flux lines out of the solenoid region from the right side. Obviously, there could be some optimal Z-position of the disk, since it should not be inserted too close to the InDet right side as not to disturb too much the field distribution in the left side region. The results of retaining the right-side shielding disk at its optimal position (470cm \(\,<\) Z\({}_{\rm disk}\)\(>\) 483cm) to keep the field quality in the ID left side within the required tolerance are shown in Figure 11 and Figure 12.

**Case-4** : No calorimeters on side C, both shielding disks are not present.

To answer the question, concerning the possibility of doing without both shielding disks when right-side EB is missing the corresponding calculation of InDet field distortion was performed (Figure 13 and Figure 14). The analysis of the result shows that the field distortion is close to the variant of the missing right-side EB and shield disk with some additional rather small (within the tolerance) field decreasing at the edge of the left side region due to removal of the left side disk. The desired field tolerance could be also provided by installation of the right-side disk in its optimal Z-position.

The situation is very similar to Case 2, which mean that the shielding disk is not necessary for the measurement of the quality of the ID field with a precision level 5\(\times\)10\({}^{-4}\).

**Case-5** : No calorimeters on side C, no shielding disks, Toroid off.

Results of calculations for case 4 but with the toroidal coils (BT and ECTs) off and only the solenoid on are given in Figure 15 and Figure 16. As can be seen from the figures there is practically no effect of the toroidal coils on the field within the InDet volume for the given model. This conclusion is close to one drawn in [3], where it was stated, that the toroids could somewhat change the magnetisation of the TileCal iron, which leads to a rather small (compared with the tolerance) shift of the InDet field level (but not the gradient).

Because of the simplification in the geometrical model of the Tile Calorimeter, such an effect might not be visible in this calculation. Experimentally the effect could be monitored by a limited number of the NMR probes, installed within the InDet volume [4].

## Magnetic forces in asymmetrical structure

Besides the field distortion the asymmetry structure could also induce additional magnetic forces in the system. The force estimation for the symmetrical situation was done in [6], [7] and [8]. For the asymmetrical ATLAS structure a review of the previous results on magnetic forces should be performed.

Figure 17 and Figure 18 summarize the calculation results on the Z-axial forces applied to various TileCal surfaces both in symmetrical and various asymmetrical cases. The axial force values in the figures were obtained by integration of the force density distribution along the radius for the selected surface multiplied by \(2\pi\). The arrows show the direction of the the force applied to the surface.

**Case-1.** Figure 19 shows the agreement between the force calculation within the given model and the previous result [6] for the ECT side of the shielding disk in the symmetrical structure. Here and further on the force density distribution is averaged over the athimuthal span of \(45^{\circ}\) (angular period of the magnetic field). The integrated force value along the Z-axis in the radial range \(50\div 380\) cm is 5kN in the previous calculation and 6kN for the given model (\(1^{\rm st}\) frame of Figure 17), which demonstrates sufficiently accurate estimation of forces in this radial region within the given model. Still, the calculation results were obtained for the simplified TileCal geometry with a rather low number of nodes. This certainly affects the force density estimation along the radial range \(380\div 423\)cm near the TileCal girder with its oversimplified structure introduced into the given computer model. So, the simulation results should be confirmed in the future by constructing a more realistic calorimeter model with a larger number of nodes. Obviously, the total force along the Z-axis is equal to zero in the case considered due to the system symmetry.

**Case-2.** In the structure without the left-side EB and disk the axial force of the order of 97kN will try to shift the TileCal iron to the right to get the system more symmetrical in relation to the solenoid field (\(2^{\rm nd}\) frame of Figure 17 and Figure 20). A comparable force (\(-148\)kN) will push the solenoid in the opposite direction. In this connection one might need to check whether the solenoid support is sufficiently strong to withstand this additional decentring force.

**Case-3.** An installation of the right-side shield disk in its optimal position in the case 2 structure will make the system more symmetrical. The force on the TileCal will decrease down to 87kN in this case (\(3^{\rm rd}\) frame of Figure 17 and Figure 21). Figure 22 presents the force calculation for the right-side disk. The total Z-axis force of (\(-65\)kN) will push the disk in the direction of the solenoid. Accordingly, the restoring symmetry force at the solenoid will decrease down to (\(-32\)kN).

**Case-4.** Removing from the case 2 structure the left-side shielding disk (no both disks) will make the TileCal iron more symmetrical compared to case 2. This will reduce the total force on the TileCal down to 56kN (\(4^{\rm th}\) frame of Figure 17 and Figure 23). But for the solenoid this system looks similar to case 2. So, the total force on the solenoid will be as in case 2. The same method to get more symmetrical structure with the help of the right-side disk in its optimal position is also applicable here.

**Case-5.** Results of calculations for case 4 but with the toroidal coils (BT and ECTs) are off and only the solenoid on are given in the \(1^{\rm st}\) frame of Figure 18 and Figure 24. As can be seen in Figure 24 the toroidal part of the force (larger radii) disappears. But since these forces practically do not contribute to the total asymmetry force, this force is close to force in case 4.

The data on the total axial forces, acting on various system elements under a variety of conditions is summarized in Table 1.

The radial forces acting on the TileCal iron will undergo less modification in the asymmetrical case as compared with the standard symmetrical structure of the magnet [6]. This can be explained by the prevailing effect of the BT field on the TileCal radial force density distribution. Nevertheless, in the selected models, where the BT part of the radial force tends to zero and the total radial forces are defined only by the solenoidal part of the field, the structure asymmetry may contribute somewhat. Obviously, the same applies to the situation when all the toroids are off (2\({}^{\text{nd}}\) frame of Figure 18). Comparison of the radial forces in the symmetrical structure (standard model) and in case 5 (present model) is given in Table 2. Since the differences are relatively small, these calculations would serve as an additional proof of the validity of the present model results.

The modification of the magnetic forces, acting on the BT and the ECT because symmetry is broken in the system are rather small since all the asymmetry effects are mostly confined in the near solenoid region and basically defined by the solenoidal part of the field.

## Conclusions

1. The distortion in the field seen on the left side of the inner detector cavity will be within the previous tolerance on the field knowledge in the InDet (0.1%) if the extended barrel and the shielding disk on the other side are not there.
2. In this case the symmetry restoring magnetic forces will appear in the TileCal and on the solenoid when the coils are turned on. In this connection one might need to check whether the solenoid support is sufficiently strong to withstand this additional decentring force.
3. Removing both shielding disks from the system will not noticeably impact the Indet field map and will somewhat reduce the total asymmetry force on the TileCal iron.

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|l|} \hline Case & Description & Left-side EB & Left-half & Right half Barrel \\ \cline{2-5}  & & & Barrel & \\ \hline
1 & Symmetrical structure & \(-17\) & \(-51\) & \(-51\) \\ \hline
5 & No BT and ECTs. Missing EB and & \(-14\) & \(-54\) & \(-64\) \\  & both disks & & & \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 2: Radial (Fr) force (kN/radian)Putting the right-side shielding disk in the structure in some optimal position will keep the left side field distortion within the new required tolerance (0.05%). This will also make the structure more symmetrical compared with the previous case, which eases the problem of the restoring symmetry magnetic forces.
5. Calculations for the selected structure when the toroidal coils (BT and ECTs) are off show that there is practically no effect of the toroidal coils on the field within the InDet volume for the given computer model. The toroids could somewhat change the magnetisation of the TileCal iron, which leads to a rather small (compared with the tolerance) shift of the InDet field level. The effect could be monitored by a limited number of the NMR probes installed within the InDet volume.
6. The given calculation results were obtained for the simplified TileCal geometry with a rather low number of nodes. It especially concerns the force density estimation near the TileCal girder with its oversimplified structure, introduced into the given computer model. More realistic computer model of the calorimeter with a larger number of nodes should be constructed to confirm the results.
