###### Abstract

In this note the noise in the Tile calorimeter is investigated with special attention to the pile-up effect. A full survey of the TileCal cells is performed, based both on pseudorapidity, bunch position in a train and number of interactions per bunch crossing. Several periods of 2011 data collected by the ATLAS experiment at \(\sqrt{s}=7\,\mathrm{TeV}\) were used in the analysis. Just one run from each data-taking period corresponding to different pile-up conditions was examined. The data were recorded by zero bias trigger. The Monte Carlo simulation was reweighted to the pile-up conditions of the data. This study contributes to a better knowledge of the Tile Calorimeter response and performance under increasing pile-up conditions.

## 1 Introduction

The ATLAS detector [1] is a general purpose detector, designed to analyse the myriad of particles produced by the collisions in the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and to investigate the widest range of physics possible. In the LHC, beams of protons are accelerated to a nominal energy of \(7\,\mathrm{TeV}\) along the beam pipe, hence the energy of the proton-proton collision in the \(pp\) rest frame will be \(\sqrt{s}=$14\,\mathrm{TeV}$\). In its final configuration, a design luminosity of \(10^{34}\,\mathrm{cm}^{-2}\mathrm{s}^{-1}\) and proton bunch crossings every \(25\,\mathrm{ns}\) are expected, leading to approximately 23 extra interactions per beam crossing. Under these heavy pile-up conditions, it is of extreme importance to comprehend the ATLAS detector response. The ATLAS experiment is arranged in several concentric cylindrical layers of subdetectors, each with a specific purpose for the reconstruction of particles produced in the collisions. The main components are the inner detector, the electromagnetic and hadronic calorimeters, the muon spectrometer and the magnetic systems. The calorimeters are a fundamental part of any hadron collider detector, such as ATLAS, since they must provide accurate energy and position measurements of electrons, photons, isolated hadrons, jets and transverse missing energy.

The Tile Calorimeter (TileCal) [2] is the ATLAS hadronic sampling calorimeter using steel as absorber and scintillating plastic plates (designated as _tiles_) as active material. It comprises alternating layers, perpendicular to the beam direction, radially staggered in depth, and has a cylindrical structure divided into four cylindrical sections or partitions: two long barrels (LB) and two extended barrels (EB). Each of these partitions is segmented into 64 azimuthal wedges, referred as modules, with \(\Delta\phi=2\pi/64\sim 0.1\). When particles cross the scintillators, the produced light is read out from two sides by wavelength shifting (WLS) fibres, which are bundled together to form readout _cells_ with three different sampling depths. Each cell is defined with an \(\eta^{1}\) coverage of 0.1. The bundles of fibres in each side of the scintillating tiles are then read out by two separate channels to provide redundancy. In other words, each tile cell is read out by two photomultipliers (PMT). With a total of 4672 readout cells, the TileCal comprises approximately 10000 PMTs in the entire calorimeter. The TileCal was designed to have good time resolution (\(\sim 1\,\mathrm{ns}\)) and a typical granularity of \(\Delta\eta\times\Delta\phi=0.1\times 0.1\) ( \(0.1\times 0.2\) for the last layer) in order to achieve good resolutions both in jet energy and missing transverse energy.

The different partitions of the TileCal are arranged along the beam axis, covering different pseudorapidity angles: the long barrels (LBA and LBC) cover the \(|\eta|<1.0\) region and the extended barrels (EBA and EBC) cover \(0.8<|\eta|<1.7\) region. The partitions are named according to the pseudorapidity angle sign, and by convention, \(A\) is positive \(\eta\) and \(C\) negative \(\eta\). As mentioned above, the calorimeter is also divided along the radial direction in 3 sampling layers (A, BC and D), leading to three main type of cells. The TileCal cell structure can be seen on Figure 1. Since the modules of every partition are segmented in cells and each cell is connected to two PMTs, every single module contains 45 (32) channels LB (EB) partition stored in metallic cases called drawers. The yellow cells in Figure 1 are single scintillators located in the plug extension and in the inter-cryostat regions.These cells have a specialised use, for example in Cesium calibrations, and are labelled gap-crack or special cells, constituting the E layer.

The TileCal PMT signal is processed by fast and low noise read-out front-end electronics near the detector. The size of these signals range from a single MIP traversing the detector (e.g. a muon \(\sim 350\,\mathrm{MeV}\) in a single cell) up to a 2 TeV shower. In extended barrel, the cell resolution for muons is around \(0.5\,\mathrm{GeV}\), \(1\,\mathrm{GeV}\) and \(0.7\,\mathrm{GeV}\) for the A, BC and D cells respectively. This response depends on \(\eta\) and on the path length of the muon in the cell. The signals from the PMT are shaped using a passive shaping circuit and these shaped pulses are then amplified in separate high (HG) and low (LG) gain branches (with a nominal gain ratio 64:1) [3]. In the Tile Data Management Unit chip, a 10-bit ADC samples the HG and LG signals with the LHC bunch-crossing frequency of \(40\,\mathrm{MHz}\) (i.e. with timingsteps of 25 ns). The digitisation timing of the ADCs is adjusted in multiples of \(\sim 0.1\) ns guaranteeing that the full extension of the pulse is sampled and that the central sample is as close to the PMT pulse peak as possible. To determine which of the gains is read out from the front-end electronics, a gain switch is used. The digitised signals are then transmitted via optical links to off-detector back-end electronics where the time and energy of the channel signal are reconstructed with the Optimal Filtering method [3; 4].

During this process undesirable effects, like cross talk [5] etc, may happen between different channel signals, perturbing a transition or recording of an input signal. Such an unwanted signal is usually defined as _noise_. Consequently, the energy distribution in zero-signal events (pedestal) will have a zero mean value, but a finite width, both for individual channels and the sum of channels. Usually the standard deviation of the energy distribution in pedestal runs is used as a noise estimate. The properties of the read-out chain directly influence the precision of the measurement, contributing to its related noise. Ultimately, the presence of noise in the TileCal energy measurements may deteriorate the jet energy resolution and the missing transverse energy reconstruction.

Notice however, that for physics signals arising from shower fluctuations, the standard deviation of the energy measurements is much larger than the noise from any source.

In the following, the noise in the TileCal is studied using data, recorded by zero bias trigger, with special attention to the pile-up effects. The zero bias trigger fires on the fifth bunch crossing after a bunch crossing with a significant energy deposition in calorimeter, i.e. a bunch crossing passing the threshold of any of calorimeter triggers. This triggering provides a data sample, which is unbiased by a significant energy deposition in calorimeter cells. Several runs recorded by the zero-bias stream over the course of 2011 data-taking were analysed. This ensures a good description of the varying detector performance, since both beam and detector conditions were changing with time.

Even though the zero-bias sample will contain a small fraction of the hard scattering events with quite large energy depositions, the contribution of these events is small on average, such that cells will be mostly exposed to low energy particles produced from soft pile-up collisions. Therefore, the noise can still be estimated as the standard deviation of the energy deposition. Here, particles from pile-up events will produce additional energy depositions in the tile cells widening the energy distribution and, possibly, pulling the mean energy from zero. The noise estimated from this sample is a combination of electronic noise and pile-up effects.

In order to reduce the dependence of the results on high energy outliers the 0.1% fraction of the

events were excluded from both the positive and negative tails of the energy distribution for each cell.

A dedicated set of Monte Carlo samples was generated with a single neutrino or a muon as a hard-scattering particle overlayed with a number of soft pile-up events generated by Pythia 6 [6]. In the case of MC sample with a single muon, only the cells with \(\Delta R(cell,muon)>0.2\)2 are considered.

Footnote 2: \(\Delta R^{2}=\Delta\phi^{2}+\Delta\eta^{2}\)

The Monte Carlo events are not simulated with exactly the same pile-up conditions as data, in particular the distribution of the number of pile-up collisions per bunch crossing might be different. Therefore, a special reweighting technique has to be applied to the simulated events to accurately describe this effect [7].

In this note, a short description of the TileCal noise is given in section 2, in particular, the pile-up noise and the Monte Carlo pile-up simulation is described in section 2.1. In section 3 the method used to study the noise of the Tile cells is described. The Noise dependence on the pseudorapidity is tested in section 3.1 and in section 3.2 its dependence with the bunch position in a train. In section 3.3 the noise dependence with the average number of interactions per bunch crossing is shown. The conclusions are discussed at the end, in section 4.

## 2 TileCal Noise and Pile-up

In the ATLAS detector, the output of each TileCal channel is the sum of pedestal, signal and random noise. The electronic noise associated to the energy measurement is the disturbance of the signal on its passage from the wavelength shifting fibers up-to (and including) the front-end ADCs [8, 9]. The noise of a cell includes contributions from the digitisation (digital noise), the intrinsic electronic noise of each single photomultiplier (raw channel noise) and from the cell architecture in the calorimeter (where a single PMT is shared by a group of tiles). Correlations among the different channels were studied in detail in [10, 11, 12]. The noise associated to an energy measurement is assumed to be the pedestal from the PMT.

The electronic noise is measured in special standalone bi-gain runs with no physics signal, i.e. in calibration runs taken without colliding beams. These are so called pedestal runs with two different electronic configurations - the low gain and the high gain. The energy distribution of the electronic noise can be described to a good precision by a double Gaussian function for each cell. The double Gaussian function is defined by three independent parameters - widths of the first and second Gaussian and the relative normalisation of two Gaussians 3. The electronic noise in the Monte Carlo simulations is added to the individual digitised samples. The noise shape at the sample level is assumed to follow the double Gaussian distribution as well. The parameters used in the simulations are based on the cell noise coefficients measured in data. More details about the electronic noise description in both data and MC simulations in TileCal can be found in [8, 9].

Footnote 3: The electronic noise depends strongly on the Low Voltage Power Supplies (LVPS). The new generation of LVPS (V 7.5) being currently installed leads to a large reduction of the non-Gaussian tails of the electronic noise [9].

### Pile-up Noise

At the LHC, the mean number of inelastic \(pp\) interactions per bunch crossing, \(<\mu>\), is related to the instantaneous luminosity, \(\mathcal{L}\):

\[<\mu>=\frac{\mathcal{L}\sigma_{inel}}{N_{bunch}\,f_{LHC}} \tag{1}\]

where \(\sigma_{inel}=71.5\,\mathrm{mb}\) is the total inelastic \(pp\) cross section 4 at \(\sqrt{s}=7\,\mathrm{TeV}\) and \(N_{bunch}\,f_{LHC}\) is the average frequency of bunch crossings in the LHC [13]. The _Luminosity Block_ (lumiblock) is the basic time unit to store luminosity information 5, therefore all possible measures of number of \(pp\) collisions will also be an average over a given luminblock. The instantaneous luminosity in 2011 reached values of \(3.65\times 10^{33}\,\mathrm{cm}^{-2}\mathrm{s}^{-1}\). The increasing luminosity per bunch crossing - and hence increasing \(\mu\) - leads to higher probability of multiple proton-proton interactions in the same bunch crossing. Consequently, in-time energy deposits originated from multiple collisions of the same bunch crossing (but different \(pp\) pair) can occur in the same TileCal cell. This _in-time pile-up_ can be studied by determining its average effect on the measured calorimeter energies.

Footnote 5: One luminblock contains roughly 2 minutes of data taking, but this can vary due to run conditions and other operational issues.

Pile-up also arises when the time interval between consecutive bunches crossing is lower than the detector integration time and therefore \(pp\) collisions from different bunch crossing may be integrated in the same event. During the 2011 data-taking, the accelerator produces collisions every \(50\,\mathrm{ns}\). Because calorimeter pulses are longer than the 50 ns bunch spacing a significant fraction of calorimeter cells will receive energy from more than one bunch crossing within the same read out window and within the same physical calorimeter cell [14]. This is called the _out-of-time pile-up_ and can considerably degrade the measurement of the energy deposited in a cell. Both in-time and out-of-time pile-up depend on the luminosity.

During the 2011 data taking period, the LHC was colliding bunches of up to \(10^{11}\) protons 40 million times per second, at a centre-of-mass energy of 7 TeV. At its designed operating conditions, LHC will run with proton bunches crossing every 25 ns with approximately 23 extra interactions per beam crossing. In this study the LHC was operating with 50 ns bunch spacing and had an average number of proton-proton collisions around 8 per bunch crossing [14]. The presence of these events, and its ever growing number, has a significant impact on the detector performance. For instance, the standard deviation of the mean energy deposition on a cell will fluctuate considerably, limiting the energy resolution of the calorimeter [15]. The understanding of the behaviour of the detector with increasing contributions from pile-up effects is of major importance.

Figure 2: Energy distribution in a cell (cell A9) for 7 TeV data with 50 ns bunch spacing collected in 2011. Two different pile-up conditions are depicted: in blue \(\mu=6\) and in red \(\mu=12\). The markers represent data and the histograms the MC sample. The data/MC ratio is represented in the lower plot, each colour representing the different pile-up conditions of the collected data.

The effect of increasing pile-up conditions on the energy reconstruction can be seen in Figure 2 for a specific cell of the TileCal. In this figure, two data samples with different pile-up conditions are represented, in blue for \(\mu=6\) and in red for \(\mu=12\). Both energy distributions have Gaussian shape in the core of the distribution and are centered at \(\sim 0\) MeV. They have quite a long non-Gaussian tails. Comparing the different pile-up conditions, it is clear that the the higher the pile-up, the wider the energy distribution gets on both negative and positive tails. Therefore, it is expected that data with increasing pile-up conditions will have higher values of total noise. The data/MC ratio is represented in the lower plot, each colour representing the different pile-up conditions of the collected data. It shows a very good data to MC agreement in the core of the distribution and in the positive tail. However, in the negative tail the discrepancy between data and MC could be as large as 100%. This is due to the fact that the out-of-time energy deposits are not well modelled in simulations.

A good description of both the electronic noise and the pile-up noise contribution as well as the combination of both is crucial for the creation of topological clusters [16] of calorimeter cells which are used in the jet and missing transverse energy reconstructions. The topological clustering algorithm searches for cells with energy deposits above the noise fluctuation level. The cell energy is compared to a 4 \(\sigma\) and to a 2 \(\sigma\) threshold in the first and second step of the clustering algorithm, respectively. The 1\(\sigma\) threshold in the environment with non-negligible pile-up contribution is defined in TileCal as

\[\sigma_{el\_noise+pile-up}=\sqrt{\sigma_{el\_noise}^{2}+\sigma_{pile-up}^{2}} \tag{2}\]

where \(\sigma_{el\_noise}\) denotes a 1 \(\sigma\) width equivalent for the double Gaussian distribution of the electronic noise. The \(\sigma_{pile\_up}\) are determined using a special MC sample generated without the electronic noise for several values of \(<\mu>\). Such an approach assumes pile-up and electronic noise to be uncorrelated. It was demonstrated [17] that \(\sigma_{pile\_up}\) increases as a function of \(\sqrt{<\mu>}\). This dependence was propagated to the Conditions DB and was used to evaluated the topocluster thresholds in both data and MC simulations.

The goal of this note is to study the dependence of the total noise on the detector geometry and pile-up conditions.

## 3 Noise Description in TileCal

Several runs at 7 TeV with 50 ns bunch spacing were analysed, each corresponding to different periods of data collected throughout the year with different beam conditions. The samples used are summarised in Table 1. The Monte Carlo sample used in this study does not account for the full pile-up conditions in data and it was reweighted to the pile-up conditions of each run to allow a data/MC comparison on run-by-run basis.

Usually two observables are used to estimate the pile-up level in ATLAS: the average number of interactions per crossing and the actual number of interactions per crossing. The first one consists in calculating the number of interactions per crossing averaged across all bunch crossing identifiers (BCID's) in the luminblock, \(<\mu>_{LB,BCID}\). Since each bunch could have a different emittances and a different number of protons, \(\mu\) values could vary for different BCID's. The second estimate of the pile-up level, is the number of interactions in a given BCID, averaged over the luminblock, \(<\mu>_{LB}(BCID)\). The Monte Carlo simulation does not include the bunch structure, so both quantities are the same in simulated events.

In order to calculate the pile-up reweighting of the MC to data, the average number of interactions per crossing ( \(<\mu>_{LB,BCID}\)) was used as an estimator of the reweight in the official ATLAS tool, PileUpReweightTool [7]. It calculates the event weight for Monte Carlo events, which scales the Monte Carlo distribution of the average number of interactions per crossing to the one in the data sample.

The average pile-up estimate, or average \(\mu\) (\(<\mu>_{LB,BCID}\)), is represented in Figure 3(a). These are data distributions, whose integral is normalised to unity, for several runs of different periods. The luminosity is increasing from run to run, that is from F2 which has the lower luminosity conditions, up to M5 with the higher luminosity conditions. As can be seen, the pile up level increases with the analysed period, which is expected since the luminosity is increasing.

In Figure 3(b) we see the distribution of the number of primary vertices in each period. The mean value of vertices in each period increases, as is expected for a higher luminosity, and is consistent with a crescent number of pile up interactions. Runs from periods F2, G4 and I2 show similar behaviours in the distributions of the average number of pile up interactions and number of primary vertices. By comparison with the other four runs (from periods L2, L4, M2, M5) one can say F2, G4 and I2 are the low pile up samples in this study. The four runs with higher pile up have an average number of primary vertices of the order of 10, which is consistent with the extra 8 collisions expected from pile-up for these luminosity conditions.

### Energy and Noise Pseudorapidity Dependence

TileCal cells located in different radial layers and at different pseudorapidities have diverse geometry. Due to the read-out system architecture, the electronic noise component will vary with the pseudorapidity of the cell. Moreover, the cells which are closer to the beam pipe are exposed to a larger amount of low-energy particles. This results in differences in both electronic and pile-up noise components for various cells.

The TileCal is symmetric in \(\eta\), having two long barrels within the \(|\eta|<1.0\) region and two extended barrels covering \(0.8<|\eta|<1.7\) region. In order to study the calorimeter dependence on the pseudorapidity, the symmetry on \(\eta\) was verified both in energy and noise distributions. Moreover, due to the calorimeter cylindrical shape, the \(\phi\) modules are homogeneous. This was tested and the energy and noise dependence on \(\phi\) was proved to be approximately constant for the same \(\eta\) tower.

In Figure 4 the mean energy deposited in a specific layer \(l\) as a function of pseudorapidity \(\eta\) is represented. It is averaged over all modules in both negative and positive \(\eta\) values. Several data-taking periods, corresponding to different pile-up conditions, are depicted in different colours and can be compared with the lowest luminosity sample from period F2, in yellow. The different markers represent the TileCal cell layers in both barrels of the calorimeter. From these plots one can see that the mean energies of both data and MC simulation are of the order of a few MeV. In the central region of the calorimeter (LB) the mean energy depositions are always less than 1 MeV for all the samplings. In the extended barrel partitions, depositions are always more energetic and the different layers of cells show different behaviours. The cells in the gap-crack region exhibit higher levels of energy deposits which is expected due to their special nature. Moreover, when comparing different periods, one sees that the higher the luminosity, the higher the average energy depositions in the calorimeter.

The Monte Carlo to data agreement was studied in Figure 5. The differences range from \(-2\,\mathrm{MeV}\) to \(2\,\mathrm{MeV}\) with a discrepancy of the order of \(1\,\mathrm{MeV}\) for the long barrel region. For the gap-crack cells, the differences between simulation and data are still consistent with \(2\,\mathrm{MeV}\) in the low pile-up runs, but vary up to \(5\,\mathrm{MeV}\) in the high pile-up samples. Differences of this magnitude between data and MC are much smaller than the precision of the measurement.

The smallness of the mean energy deposited in Tile cells could be attributed to the Optimal Filtering method [3, 4] used in the reconstruction, which subtracts the pedestal on an event-by-event basis.

In this study the noise of a cell (due to both the electronics and the pile-up conditions) was estimated as the standard deviation of the energy deposited within that cell. Taking advantage of the TileCal structure, i.e. \(\phi\) homogeneity and \(\eta\) symmetry, the mean noise was obtained inclusively over all modules and \(|\eta|\). In Figure 6 the total noise of TileCal cells is represented as a function of the cell pseudorapidity \(|\eta|\) for several periods of data-taking. Data periods are shown in different colours and are compared to the lowest luminosity sample, period F2, in yellow. From these plots one can see that noise ranges between \(20\) to \(50\,\mathrm{MeV}\) for the low pile up periods (F2, G4 and I2) in the long barrel partitions and the calorimeter response is constant within the same type of cell layer. The noise value increases with proximity to the

The markers represent the data sample, one run from each period F2, G4, I2, L2, L4, M2 and M5 according to the colours in the legend, and the histograms the MC sample.

beam pipe, thus A-cells have higher noise than D-cells. In the extended barrel partitions, noise values are higher (up to 180 MeV) and the different layers of cells show different behaviours. When looking into the higher luminosity periods (L2, L4, M2, M5) one sees that the noise tends to increase with increasing pile-up in the whole calorimeter: now going up to 60 MeV in the LB regions and up to 50 MeV in the EB.

Figure 7 shows the difference between the mean value of noise as a function of \(|\eta|\) measured in MC and in Data. Differences up to 10 MeV in the long barrel partitions and up to 40 MeV in the extended barrel are observed.

For more detailed information, the noise in different layers is represented in Figures 8 and 9 respectively for a low pile-up run (from period F2 with \(<\mu>=4.8\)) and a high pile-up run (from period M2 with \(<\mu>=11.3\)). The top left (right) plots show the results obtained for the cells of Layer A (Layer BC). The bottom left (right) plots show the results obtained for the cells of Layer D (Special Cells). In the case of the reference sample F2, in Figure 8, noise values range from 20 MeV to up to 45 MeV for A, BC and D layers. Here, the extended-barrel is slightly noisier than the long-barrel, but clearly the noisier cells are the gap-crack ones, where noise values range from \(\sim 40\) MeV to 150 MeV. The MC describes data up to a 2 MeV (5 MeV) difference for the A, BC and D layers of the LB (EB). The special cells show differences between the mean value of noise measured in MC and in Data up to 20 MeV. For high pile-up conditions, the noise values for A-cells range from 40 MeV to up to 70 MeV, as can be seen in Figure 9. Noise values are around 20 MeV for D cells and goes from 30 MeV up to 40 MeV for BC cells. This is consistent with the TileCal cell structure, since cell layers closer to beam pipe exhibit higher levels of pile-up noise than the ones in the outer layers of the calorimeter. Again, the extended-barrel is slightly

noisier than the long-barrel. The special cells show a much noisier behaviour, with noise values ranging from \(\sim 70\,\mathrm{MeV}\) to \(200\,\mathrm{MeV}\). The data to MC agreement shows differences of the order of \(3\,\mathrm{MeV}\) for the A layer in the LB and goes up to \(8\,\mathrm{MeV}\) in the EB. For the BC and D layers the data to MC differences throughout the whole calorimeter are of the order of \(2\,\mathrm{MeV}\) and \(3\,\mathrm{MeV}\) respectively. The differences between simulation and data in the gap-crack cells vary up to \(30\,\mathrm{MeV}\).

The differences observed between data and MC simulations are due to imperfect modelling of the out-of-time energy depositions.

Notice that in the \(1.0\leq|\eta|\leq 1.2\) region there is a change in the noise behaviour, which is simply a reflection of the TileCal geometry: this is where the gap with inactive materials (such as cables) between the Tilecal Long-Barrel and Extended-Barrel partitions is (c.f. Figure 1). In these pseudorapidity towers, the cells have to be smaller, with less scintillating material, and moreover only the EB cells cover the \(|\eta|\geq 1.1\) region. This, together with the fact that some of the energy deposition in the inactive materials is lost, explains the slight reduction of the noise value for \(1.1\leq|\eta|\leq 1.2\).

### Energy and Noise Dependence on the Bunch Position

During 2011 data-taking, the LHC was running with bunch trains, with \(\sim 60\) filled bunches spaced by \(50\) ns intervals, which was followed by a large time interval with empty bunches. Since the length of the calorimeter pulse is larger than the time interval between consequent bunch crossing, the energy reconstruction in a given event could be biased by the energy deposited in the same cell during the previous (or following) event. This effect could result in a dependence of shape of energy distribution on

Figure 9: The noise distribution in different TileCal cells is represented as a function of \(|\eta|\) of the cells for zero bias run 190617 of period M2 of 2011 data with an average number of interactions \(<\mu>=11.3\) per bunch crossing.

the position of the bunch crossing in the train.

In Figure 10 the distributions of the number of events as a function of the bunch crossing position in a train for the studied periods is shown. Events throughout the year show a similar distribution, the majority of them having train lengths of up to 60 bunches and a small fraction of events having trains up to 70 bunches.

The cell response is similar for cells in different towers, as long as they belong to the same layer and partition. Thus, in order to simplify this study and increase statistics, the BCID dependence of both the energy depositions and noise of a tile cell was done cumulating over modules and pseudorapidity towers, within the same layer and partition.

In Figure 11 the mean energy deposition as function of the BCID, for cell layer A of the long barrel is represented. A full survey of the TileCal cells can be seen in appendix A.1, for both barrels and all layers of the calorimeter. The mean energy deposition fluctuates with the BCID having a slight tendency to be higher for the first and last bunches in the train in all layers of the TileCal. The data events in the D layer, however, show slightly lower mean energy values for the last bunches in the train. As seen in the pseudorapidity distributions, the energy value increases with proximity to the beam pipe, thus for the A-cells the distribution floats around higher levels of energy than in the D-cells. The extended barrels show slight higher values of energy depositions than the long barrel ones.

A similar study was done for the noise, estimated as the standard deviation of the energy distribution of a cell. The total noise in A-cells of the long barrel as function of the BCID is shown in Figure 12. For further details see in appendix A.2 the full survey of the TileCal layers. The noise shows the same dependence on the BCID as the energy depositions. In the special cells, for instance, the mean noise fluctuates around 150 MeV for the low pile-up periods and around 220 MeV for the higher pile-up runs. As we go away from the beam pipe in the radial direction (from A cells to D cells), the noise tends to decrease from layer to layer, as seen in the \(\eta\) studies.

### Noise Dependence on the Number of Interactions per bunch crossing

The increasing number of pile-up collisions results in widening of energy distributions, cf Section 2.1. Hence, the total noise should grow with average number of interactions per bunch crossing. In order to quantify this affect, the whole sample was binned in \(<\mu>\) and the total noise per cell was measured as a function of pile-up.

Total noise of TileCal cells for different layers (A, BC, D and E) as a function of \(<\mu>\) in long barrel at \(\eta=0.45\) and in the extended barrel at \(\eta=1.15\) is shown in Figure 13.

The noise smoothly grows with the increase of the number of interactions per bunch crossing in all four layers. However its dependence is more steep for the A cells than for the BC cells, and for these ones than for the D cells. This reflects the calorimeter layer structure, where the layers closer to the beam pipe are more noisier and more susceptible to pile-up. As already seen in previous sections, the cells in the gap-crack region show higher values of noise. These special cells are also more sensible to changes in pile-up conditions, showing a more prominent rate in the noise as function of the actual number of interactions per bunch crossing. The dashed lines are representing a linear fit to the data in each cell. When propagated to \(\mu=0\) one obtains noise values consistent with the electronic noise as expected.

Figure 13: Noise distribution as a function of the average number of interactions per crossing for all samplings of the LBA and EBA TileCal partition. The colours represent the different layers: cells A in blue, BC in red, D in green and E in orange. The dashed lines represent a linear fit.

Here, the noise dependence on the square root of number of interactions per bunch crossing was tested by performing a linear fit in all four samplings of the Tile calorimeter. In the outer layers of Tile calorimeter (BC and D) the noise increases linearly with the level of pileup, while in the layer A and layer E the noise demonstrates a square root growth with increasing number of simultaneous \(pp\) collisions.

## 4 Conclusion

A new study of the pile up dependency of the energy depositions and noise in the Tile Calorimeter was performed. The study started with the simple assumption that the noise can still be characterised by the standard deviation of the energy cell deposition in zero bias data. All partitions and layers were studied and the dependencies with \(\eta\), \(BCID\) and number of interactions per bunch crossing were checked.

The pile up increases with the luminosity of the run, so the 2011 periods of data showed an increasing average number of interactions through out the year. Consequently, the mean energy depositions also increase in the calorimeter cells, from period to period, according to the increasing pile up level. The behaviour of the cells within the calorimeter is still constant from run to run: long barrel cells show a decrease of the energy deposition, the further they are from the beam pipe; the extended barrel cells show higher values of energy. The noise follows the same pattern as the mean energy, being more significant in the forward region of the detector. Again the higher the number of pile up interactions, the higher the noise in the cell. However, the values do not tend to be significant to the measure, since they go only up to 250 MeV. Given the special structure of the gap-crack cells, these tend to be more susceptible to the pile-up noise than the normal cells of the calorimeter.

The noise tends to increase with the number of interactions per bunch crossing. The rate to which the noise depends on the actual number of interactions per bunch crossing is slightly faster for A cells (which are closer to the beam pipe) than for BC cells or D cells. Again the special cells show a higher dependence on the pile-up level. Since the pile-up conditions are proportional to the luminosity of the data, a correct model of the noise dependence with pile-up will contribute to a better description of noise in simulation, allowing to better and more precise results of the ATLAS experiment.

The Monte Carlo simulation describes the 2011 data quite reasonably and can be used to remove the noise from our measurements. Modules in the extended regions of the calorimeter are under more radiation and hence show more noisy distributions.

These studies are continued with 2012 data, at different centre-of-mass energies, luminosities and bunch spacings in order to better describe the noise structure in the Tile Calorimeter.
