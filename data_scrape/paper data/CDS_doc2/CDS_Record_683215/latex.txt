3. Costing1. MAGNETETIC DESIGN This section contains magnetic design data for both Eagle A (small solenoid) and Eagle B (large solenoid) options. A number of iron yoke return options are presented with data on field integrals in the central tracking region, central fields and stray fields outside the yoke structures. Field integrals were taken as a function of rapidity over tracks within the boundaries r = 1.05m, z = 4m covering the central tracking region. Design parameters are given in Table 1 with field integral and stray field data in Table 2. The following plots show flux distributions.

2. MECHANICAL DESIGN

This section contains outline data on mechanical designs for both small and large coil options. For the small solenoid solutions, Eagle A, both integrated and non integrated design options are presented with tabulated data on materials. This analysis suggests a saving of ~0.2RL by integration and a saving of 50 - 100mm on radial space required.

Data for the design of the liquid argon inner vessel is presented. Alternative modes of fabrication, based on a thin 2mm stainless steel shell with various internal support structures are tabulated to show effective radiation length. This analysis suggests that a design based on aluminium box section or honeybee type support offers the best solution.

3. COSTING

Initial cost estimates for both Eagle A and Eagle B are given. The costs were developed by scaling from DELPHI Soienoid fabrication costs.
