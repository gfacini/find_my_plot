[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:1]

Introduction

Many analyses at the LHC will rely on the presence of \(b\)-quarks. Top production, Standard Model Higgs boson searches, and searches for physics beyond the Standard Model, for example, all have final states involving \(b\)-quarks. To estimate the backgrounds from well known Standard Model processes after applying \(b\)-tagging algorithms it is necessary to know the tagging efficiency for \(b\)-jets, for light-jets (fake rate or mistagging rate), and for \(c\)-jets (charm-tagging efficiency). All three efficiencies should be measured as accurately as possible: systematic errors in the \(b\)-tagging calibration can translate to large errors in an analysis. Although the fake rate and \(c\)-tagging rate are important, only the \(b\)-tagging efficiency is considered in this note.

In order to measure the \(b\)-tagging efficiency we must know the bottom quark content ('\(b\)-content') of a calibration sample well. Unfortunately, it is difficult to select a pure \(b\)-jet sample in the data. Two independent methods to calibrate the \(b\)-tagging algorithms are currently under study in ATLAS. The first method uses a high purity sample of top quark events. Full kinematic reconstruction enables the proper identification of the jet resulting from the fragmentation of the \(b\)-quark from the top quark decay. A tagging algorithm can be run on that sample of jets and the efficiency measured [1]. Similarly, one can count tags in a high purity sample of top events and estimate both the tag rate and the cross section [1].

This note describes the determination of the \(b\)-tagging efficiency in QCD jet data. Unfiltered QCD jet data have a very small fraction of \(b\)-jets at small jet energy and small effective \(\sqrt{s}\), however. In order to increase the fraction of \(b\)-jets we require that jets in the sample contain a muon. Though muons come from other sources, a major source is the semi-leptonic decay of \(b\)-quarks or \(c\)-quarks resulting from the \(b\)-quark decays. A consequence is that only the lifetime tagging efficiency in semi-leptonic decays of \(b\)-jets is measured by the techniques described here. The semi-leptonic efficiency must be corrected to obtain an inclusive \(b\)-tagging efficiency. The scaling is determined from Monte Carlo; this note only briefly touches on the determination of this scale factor.

Two standard lifetime-based \(b\)-tagging algorithms, IP2D and IP3D+SV1 [2], are used to demonstrate the calibration methods and estimate systematic errors. Briefly, IP2D uses reconstructed tracks and their transverse impact parameters to look for jets with displaced tracks inconsistent with light-jets. IP3D+SV1 is a combined tagger: IP3D is similar to IP2D, but also takes the longitudinal impact parameter into account; SV1 reconstructs a secondary vertex from tracks near a jet. SV1 uses a likelihood made up of the invariant mass of the tracks associated with the secondary vertex, the ratio of the energy of tracks in the secondary vertex to the energy of tracks associated to the jet, and the total number of two-track vertices reconstructed in a jet. Methods that measure the \(b\)-tagging efficiency that work for these particular taggers are expected to work for other lifetime taggers as well.

Two separate calibration techniques are described in this note:

* The \(p_{T,rel}\) method, described in Section 3, uses Monte Carlo-derived templates, for \(b\)-, \(c\)-, and light-jets, of the relative \(p_{T}\) of a muon with respect to the jet+muon axis. The \(b\)-content of a jet data sample can then be determined by fitting the \(p_{T,rel}\) distribution of the data with these templates before and after the lifetime tagging algorithms are applied. The \(b\)-tagging efficiency is derived from the changing \(b\)-fraction.
* The System 8 method, described in Section 4, employs two samples with different \(b\)-content and two uncorrelated tagging algorithms to construct a system of 8 nonlinear equations and 8 unknowns. One of the unknowns is the \(b\)-lifetime tagging efficiency.

Both of these techniques require a large sample of jets with muons. Section 2 describes a dedicated trigger that will be used to collect this sample along with the Monte Carlo samples and selection cuts used in this study.

The performance of the tagging algorithms varies with both jet \(p_{T}\) and \(\eta\)[2]. This is caused by both geometrical acceptance effects and variations in the track reconstruction efficiency. Both methods described in this note measure the efficiency as a function of \(p_{T}\) and \(\eta\). The dependence on other variables could also be measured if required.

The efficiency measured from jet data is largely uncorrelated with that measured from the \(t\bar{t}\) data, since the data sets and the techniques are uncorrelated. Thus the results obtained with the two methods can be combined to further improve the understanding of \(b\)-tagging and reduce associated systematic errors. At low jet energies the \(t\bar{t}\) method is rather sensitive to background contamination, a region where the jet method will perform best. At higher jet energies the \(t\bar{t}\) method will have a better accuracy.

## 2 Samples and selection

Several sets of Monte Carlo QCD jet events were generated specially for this study. The jet samples were generated with the standard dijet process using the PYTHIA Monte Carlo generator and full ATLAS detector simulation and detector reconstruction software. ATLAS splits generation of its QCD samples by requiring the hard scatter parton \(p_{T}\) to be within a certain range: between 17 and 35 GeV, between 35 and 70 GeV, between 70 and 140 GeV, and between 140 and 280 GeV. Approximately 100,000 events were generated in each range. After generation the samples are combined for the analysis.

The \(b\)-jet statistics in the QCD sample are not sufficient to test the methods discussed here. To increase statistics we also generated _muon+jet samples_, which further required in each event a muon from any source with a true \(p_{T}>3\) GeV and \(|\eta|<2\). The \(p_{T}\) cut was chosen as a representative lower limit for muons that can accurately be reconstructed and identified (we make a reconstructed muon \(p_{T}>4\) GeV cut). The requirement of a muon has a dramatic effect on the flavor composition of the sample, increasing the \(b\)-jet content by about a factor of 10, and increasing the \(c\)-jet content by about a factor of 5.

Identification of electrons in jets is more challenging than that of muons, and so in the studies reported here we restrict ourselves to the muon channel.

### Selection cuts

This analysis depends, primarily, on two reconstructed objects: jets and muons. Jets are found as \(\Delta R<0.4\) cone jets with a \(p_{T}>15\) GeV [3]. Jets are calibrated with a standard jet energy scale calibration (and the jet \(p_{T}\) includes the muon \(p_{T}\)) [4]. Muons are reconstructed from tracks in the outer muon detectors and must match an inner detector track with a fit \(\chi^{2}<10\). The muons must have a reconstructed \(p_{T}>4\) GeV [5]. A _muon-tagged jet_ is a jet with a muon contained within a cone of \(\Delta R<0.4\) of the jet axis.

The _flavor_ of each jet must be determined (\(b\)-, \(c\)-, or light-jet) in Monte Carlo. The ATLAS flavor labeling algorithm [2] is used. A jet is labeled as a \(b\)-jet if a \(b\)-quark with \(p_{T}>5\) GeV is found in a cone of size \(\Delta R=0.3\) around the jet direction. If no \(b\)-quark is present, but instead a \(c\)-quark is found then the jet is labeled as a charm jet. Remaining jets are labeled as light-jets. Light-jets include jets that originate from a gluon as well as a \(u\)-, \(d\)-, or \(s\)-quark. A \(b\)- or \(c\)-quark that originates from gluon splitting will be classified as a \(b\)- or \(c\)-jet as long as the \(b\)- or \(c\)-quark is within \(\Delta R<0.3\) of the jet axis.

### Monte Carlo biases

Requiring that a true muon from \(b\) or \(c\) decay is present as imposed on the muon+jet Monte Carlo sample means that almost all muons from decays of \(\pi\)/K, or from material interactions, are missing. These latter sources are here denoted _secondary muons_. They are present in the inclusive jet sample, of course.

The QCD jet sample predicts the secondary muon rate shown by the filled circles in Fig. 1 (left). The muon+jet samples have a very different secondary muon average fraction, especially at low muon \(p_{T}\), as seen by the open circles in Fig. 1 (left). Fig. 1 (right) shows the fraction of jets with selected muons which are \(b\)-jets in the two samples.

The adequacy of the modeling of the secondary muons was checked, firstly by checking that the secondary muon rates were consistent separately for \(b\)-jets, \(c\)-jets, and light-jets between the inclusive jet and muon+jet samples. Secondly, we compared the lifetime tagging rates of \(b\)-jets and light-jets in the two samples as a function of \(p_{T}\) after requiring a reconstructed muon. The results are shown in Fig. 2. The \(b\)-jet tag rates (a tag is defined as a jet having an IP3D+SV1 weight greater than 4) in the QCD jet and muon+jet samples are consistent within statistics. The light-jet lifetime-tag rate is a factor of about three higher in the muon+jet sample than in the muon-tagged inclusive jet sample. This arises from semi-leptonic heavy flavor decays in nearby jets which contaminate the light-jets with a muon and a displaced vertex. Muon-tagged jets in the QCD jet sample are less likely to suffer from this contamination because the muon is more likely to be a secondary, and thus not be associated with an event containing a \(b\)-quark. Real data is expected to look more like the QCD jet sample with the lower lifetime-tagger tag rate. We have checked that neither tagging calibration technique is affected by changes in the relative mix of light-jet muon sources as far as current Monte Carlo statistics allow.

### Trigger

Dedicated trigger signatures are necessary to obtain the required number of muon+jet events. We consider the statistics obtainable as a function of jet \(p_{T}\). We also discuss a more sophisticated trigger to increase statistics at high jet \(p_{T}\) compared to a single jet trigger. A full discussion of the operation of the ATLAS jet and muon trigger systems can be found elsewhere [6, 7].

The most obvious choice for a muon+jet trigger is a simple coincidence of lepton and jet triggers requiring no geometrical correlation. The rate for such a trigger is high, so that it must be prescaled,

Figure 1: The left plot shows the fraction of all muons with reconstructed \(p_{T}>4\) GeV that are secondary muons vs muon \(p_{T}\) in the QCD samples (filled circles) and in the muon+jet samples (open circles). The difference is caused by the generator-level filtering of the \(\mu\) samples before ATLAS simulation has a chance to create the secondary muons. The right plot shows the fraction of muon-tagged jets that are due to a \(b\)-quark as identified by the default Monte Carlo labeling algorithm. In both plots, the black open circles represent muon-tagged jets found in the muon+jet sample and the red filled circles represent muon-tagged jets found in the QCD jet sample.

especially at low \(p_{T}\). The flexible multi-level trigger system of ATLAS allows geometrical correlations to be used, explicitly requiring that the muon is close to the triggering jet direction.

In the current trigger menu foreseen for running at luminosities around \(10^{31}\,\mathrm{cm}^{-2}\mathrm{s}^{-1}\)[8], various muon and jet trigger thresholds are available at Level-1 (L1). Example combinations of these thresholds which are promising for the studies reported here are the two triggers L1_MU4_J10 and L1_MU6_J10, which are L1 signatures with a muon with \(p_{T}>4\) or 6 GeV and a jet with \(p_{T}>10\) GeV.

At Level-2 (L2) the muon selection is refined [7]: the selection sequence is started by the _muFast_ algorithm which confirms L1 muon candidates and makes a more precise muon momentum measurement using muon spectrometer hit information. A fast track combination algorithm, _muComb_, matches tracks found by muFast with tracks found in the inner detector. For the studies reported here, no further selection is made at the third trigger level, the event filter (EF).

Since the trigger rate is likely to be limited by bandwidth considerations at low \(p_{T}\) rather than the physics rate, the key parameter in considering the trigger performance is the purity of the sample in terms of the final selected events which are desired: the offline muon-tagged jets. We define the purity of the triggered sample as the fraction of events passing the trigger that contain such an offline muon-tagged jet. For the purpose of this study, the offline muon-tagged jet candidate is as defined in Section 2 (\(p_{T}>4\) GeV matching a reconstructed jet with \(p_{T}>15\) GeV). The purities of jet samples selected by the different trigger requirements discussed above are shown in Table 1.

The second and subsequent rows of Table 1 show that a further refinement is possible by asking for angular matching between the trigger muon and jet directions (taken here to be within \(\Delta R=\sqrt{\Delta\phi^{2}+\Delta\eta^{2}}<0.4\)). The choice between L1_MU4_J10 and L1_MU6_J10 will be driven essentially by the required muon \(p_{T}\) acceptance. Overall, purities relative to the offline selected sample of around 80% are attainable. This refined algorithm will be implemented for data-taking.

A further concern is to provide a good coverage in jet \(p_{T}\) extending from low \(p_{T}\) as discussed above to much higher jet \(p_{T}\), where the highest jet threshold will run unprescaled. The strategy adopted, similar to the one used for the inclusive jet trigger, consists of building up a set of muon-jet triggers with different jet trigger thresholds with prescale factors that diminish as \(p_{T}\) rises. Figure 3 (left) shows the \(p_{T}\) distribution of the jet belonging to the muon-jet candidate selected using the signature L2_mu4_J10. Using the set of signatures L2_mu4_J10, L2_mu4_J18, L2_mu4_J23, L2_mu4_J35, L2_mu4_J42 with prescale factors

Figure 2: Tag rates (IP3D+SV1 weight \(>4\)) for jets containing a reconstructed muon. The left plot are jets labeled as \(b\)-jets and the right plot are jets labeled as light-jets. In both plots, the open circles represent muon-tagged jets found in the muon+jet sample and the filled circles represent muon-tagged jets found in the QCD jet sample.

Under the assumption that the rate budget for the muon+jet trigger is 1 Hz, 100 000 muon+jet events are expected for around 30 hours of running time, corresponding to 1 pb\({}^{-1}\) of data at a luminosity of \(10^{31}\,\mathrm{cm}^{-2}\mathrm{s}^{-1}\). The combined muon-jet sample used in this study is therefore equivalent to roughly 5 pb\({}^{-1}\) of data, assuming that the \(p_{T}\) acceptance of the trigger is comparable to that generated in the Monte Carlo samples.

## 3 The \(p_{T,rel}\) method

The \(p_{T,rel}\) method is based on the different relative transverse momentum distributions of muons in \(b\)-jets, \(c\)-jets, and light-jets. This arises because the muon typically originates from the semi-leptonic decay of a heavy hadron in heavy-flavor jets. The variable \(p_{T,rel}\) is defined as the \(p_{T}\) of the muon with respect to the jet+muon axis. As can be seen Fig. 4, \(p_{T,rel}\) has good discrimination between \(b\)-jets and \(c\)-jets and light-jets.

The fraction of \(b\)-jets in the muon-tagged jet sample is estimated by performing a fit to the \(p_{T,rel}\) distribution of muons using templates describing the \(p_{T,rel}\) shape from \(b\)-jets, \(c\)-jets and light-jets. The first two templates are determined from Monte Carlo using muons originating either from \(b\)- or \(c\)-hadron decays. The template for light-jets is obtained by picking random tracks from

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{||l||c|c||} \hline \multicolumn{1}{||c||}{Signature} & \(X=4\) GeV & \(X=6\) GeV \\ \hline L1\_MUX\_J10 & \(20\pm 1\)\% & \(40\pm 3\)\% \\ \hline L1\_MUX\_J10 (\(\mu\)-jet matching) & \(51\pm 3\)\% & \(79\pm 7\)\% \\ \hline L2\_muX(muFast\_)J10 (\(\mu\)-jet matching) & \(70\pm 5\)\% & \(82\pm 8\)\% \\ \hline L2\_muX(muComb: \(\mu\)+ID)\_J10 (\(\mu\)-jet matching) & \(78\pm 6\)\% & \(84\pm 8\)\% \\ \hline \end{tabular}

In the case of the sum of triggers, the triggers were relatively prescaled by factors 50/15/12/12/1. In both plots the muon is confirmed at L2 by the muComb algorithm.

in close proximity, assuming a uniform probability that such tracks fake a muon. We plan on using the same procedure to determine the light-jet templates from data once data is available, although we will still use Monte Carlo for the \(b\)- and \(c\)-templates. A systematic uncertainty will arise from the presence of non \(b\)- and \(c\)-jets in the real data sample, as discussed in Section 3.3.

The \(p_{T,rel}\) templates are determined in bins of jet \(p_{T}\) and \(\eta\) to allow the \(b\)-tagging efficiency to be measured as a function of these variables. The \(p_{T,rel}\) distribution is fitted by allowing the normalization of the three templates to vary and minimizing a likelihood that also accounts for the template statistics [9]. The fit results are expressed in terms of fit fractions of the \(b\)-, \(c\)-, and light-jet \(p_{T,rel}\) templates, \(F_{b}\), \(F_{c}\) and \(F_{\rm light}\). The \(b\)-tagging efficiency is obtained from the fit results by:

\[\epsilon_{b}^{data,i}=\frac{N_{\mu-jet}^{tag,i}F_{b}^{tag,i}}{N_{\mu-jet}^{i} F_{b}^{i}} \tag{1}\]

where \(N_{\mu-jet}^{i}\) and \(N_{\mu-jet}^{tag,i}\) are, respectively, the number of \(\mu\)-jets in the \(i\)'th jet \(p_{T}\) and \(\eta\) bin before and after tagging.

As described in Section 5, a Monte Carlo-based correction is needed to correct the efficiency for \(b\)-jets with a muon to inclusive \(b\)-jets. In this section we discuss only the lifetime-tagging efficiency measurement for \(b\)-jets with muons.

### Measuring the \(b\)-tagging efficiency using \(p_{T,rel}\)

The full muon+jet sample was split into two equal parts. The first half was used to obtain the \(p_{T,rel}\) templates for light-, \(c\)- and \(b\)-jets, while the second half was used to measure the tagging performance.

As mentioned above, the light-jet \(p_{T,rel}\) templates were built from the \(p_{T,rel}\) of all tracks within a cone of \(\Delta R<0.4\) and \(p_{T}>4\) GeV of any reconstructed jet labeled as 'light'. The candidate jet was further required to be at least \(\Delta R\) away from any other non-light-labeled jet.

Representative templates are shown in Fig. 4. The \(p_{T,rel}\) distributions depend on jet \(p_{T}\), especially for \(b\)-jets, and the templates are therefore derived in several bins of jet \(p_{T}\). For high-\(p_{T}\) jets, the separation power of the \(p_{T,rel}\) variable significantly decreases: both the shape and peak value of the \(p_{T,rel}\) distribution for \(b\)-jets approaches that of \(c\)- and light-jets. This can be seen in the right plot of Fig. 4.

The ROOT TFractionFitter [9] algorithm is used to fit the templates to the data (the second half of the Monte Carlo sample for this study). TFractionFitter uses a standard likelihood fit that takes into account both the template and data statistics. It includes the constraint that the templates must sum to the data distribution. The histograms in Fig. 5 show the results of the fit applied to muon-tagged jet samples before applying the IP3D+SV1agger (left) and after (right). Since the shape of the templates for \(c\)- and light-jets do not differ greatly, the relative rate of \(c\)- and light-jets is not so well determined. The shape of the template for \(b\)-jets does differ significantly, and so the fraction of \(b\)-jets can be reliably determined. The \(b\)-tagging efficiency is then determined directly using Equation (1).

As a first step, an inclusive \(b\)-tagging efficiency was measured, averaged over the \(p_{T}\) and \(\eta\) spectra of the jets. The results for the inclusive \(b\)-tagging efficiency, for various cuts on the tagger weight \(w\), are presented in Table 2. Good agreement is observed between the true Monte Carlo \(b\)-tagging efficiency and that measured with the \(p_{T,rel}\) method, within 1-2% statistical precision.

The stability and sensitivity of the algorithm was tested by varying the fraction of \(b\)-jets in the Monte Carlo data-like test sample. This can be done in two ways: by decreasing the number of \(b\)-jets or by adding more light-jets to the initial sample. We have chosen the second approach.

We varied the input fraction of light-jets in the Monte Carlo test sample (and thus the fraction of \(b\)-jets) and re-measured the efficiency. The true input fractions and those obtained from fits to templates are shown in Table 3. We find agreement within statistical errors.

### \(b\)-tagging efficiency as a function of jet \(p_{T}\) and \(\eta\)

The \(b\)-tagging efficiency is strongly dependent on jet \(p_{T}\) and \(\eta\)[2]. The above Monte Carlo test is an average and is only applicable for physics analysis that have the same kinematic properties as the muon+jet sample. In order to properly account for such effects the \(b\)-tagging efficiency should be parameterized and measured as a function of at least these two variables. Since the Monte Carlo statistics are limited, the method is tested by binning separately in \(p_{T}\) and \(\eta\). With more statistics a two-dimensional \((p_{T},\eta)\)-binning will be used. For the first case, the \(p_{T,rel}\) templates are derived in several jet \(p_{T}\) bins. Event samples in each \(p_{T}\) bin are split in half as before: the first half was used to determine the \(b\), \(c\), and light jet \(p_{T,rel}\) templates, while the second half was used as a data-like test sample to measure the \(b\)-tagging efficiency. The efficiency obtained in this way is integrated over the whole jet \(\eta\) spectrum. The procedure was repeated to measure the efficiency dependence on jet \(|\eta|\). In this case, the efficiency was integrated over the \(p_{T}\) spectrum of jets.

The measured \(p_{T}\) dependence of the \(b\)-tagging efficiency is shown in Fig. 6 (left) for the tagger IP3D+SV1. We observe a good agreement between measured and true efficiencies in this low jet \(p_{T}\) region. For jets with \(p_{T}>80\) GeV, not shown, the statistical error from the fit becomes large and the results become unreliable. At present, therefore, we conclude that the efficiency can be reliably determined only in the low jet \(p_{T}\) region (\(p_{T}<80\) GeV). This is related to the poor separation of \(b\)-jet templates from \(c\)- and light-jet templates in the high jet \(p_{T}\) region (compare the plots in Fig. 4 for an example). In view of this, the \(|\eta|\)-dependence of the \(b\)-tagging efficiency was studied only for jets with

\begin{table}

\(p_{T}<80\) GeV (Fig. 6 right). Good agreement over the whole \(|\eta|\) range is observed.

### Expected Errors

The high yield of muon-tagged jets from the muon-jet trigger means that the statistical error for determining efficiencies with the \(p_{T,rel}\) method should rapidly become small: for 100 pb\({}^{-1}\) of data, for example, the overall statistical error would already be well below 1%.

The study of the systematic errors in the \(p_{T,rel}\) method is in progress, and will require real data for detailed evaluation. Sources of systematic error being considered include:

* The major uncertainty of this method is the use of Monte Carlo to model the \(p_{T,rel}\) templates for \(b\)- and \(c\)-jets. A change in the fragmentation function, for example, will likely change the muon \(p_{T,rel}\) spectrum. We estimated the contribution of these effects by scaling the \(p_{T,rel}\) shape of the \(b\) and \(c\) templates, resulting in an change in \(\varepsilon_{\rm meas}\) of 5%.
* The light-jet templates will be drawn from data and thus will have some heavy flavor contamination. QCD Monte Carlo predicts a jet sample will contain 2.5% \(b\)-jets and 5% \(c\)-jets. We expect

The test sample (black error bars) was fit with the \(p_{T,rel}\) templates obtained from QCD jet Monte Carlo samples (green triangle: light-jet, blue square: \(c\)-jet, and red dot: \(b\)-jet). The red histogram is the result of the fit. The left plot shows the fit results for all muon-tagged jets, and the right shows that obtained after tagging.

Table 3: The stability of the \(p_{T,rel}\) method as a function of changing \(b\)-, \(c\)-, and light-jet fractions. The fraction of \(b\)-jets was varied by altering the number of light-jets as described in the text. The first two columns show the true and fitted fractions of \(b\)-jets in the muon-tagged jet sample (\(f_{B}\) - true and \(f_{B}\) - result of fit). The remaining columns show the efficiency for two taggers (IP3D+SV1 with \(w>7\) and IP2D with \(w>3\)) as measured directly in Monte Carlo (\(\varepsilon_{true}\), and as determined by the \(p_{t,rel}\) method (\(\varepsilon_{meas}\)).

little error to be introduced by \(c\)-jets as their \(p_{T,rel}\) distribution is so similar to light-jets. We tested the effect of 2.8% \(b\)-jets in the pool of jets that was used to determine the light-jet template and re-ran the \(p_{T,rel}\) fit. We observed a systematic shift to smaller \(b\)-jet efficiencies by 3%. We add \(\pm\)3% as a systematic error due to heavy flavor contamination of the light jet templates. There is evidence we can mitigate the size of this error by rejecting jets from the light-jet template that satisfy a loose lifetime tagging requirement.
* Detector modeling has also been examined as a source of further systematic error. Jet \(p_{T}\) resolution, the muon \(p_{T}\) resolution, and the jet and muon direction resolution are all potential contributors. Studies indicate the error due to this are of order a few percent. Detector modeling of muon systematics have not been studied as it is assumed that the Monte Carlo modeling errors will be larger.
* We have an implicit assumption that all tracks in jets correctly model the \(p_{T,rel}\) distribution for light jets. A further systematic will exist because \(p_{T,rel}\) distribution for fake muons in light jets is not the same as the tracks associated with light jets.

These preliminary studies to date indicate that the systematic error sources should be controllable at the level of 6% or better on the lifetime tagging efficiency.

## 4 The System 8 method

The System 8 technique is designed to measure the \(b\)-tagging efficiency with reduced dependence on Monte Carlo [10], [11]. This method uses two data samples with different \(b\)-fractions and two uncorrelated tagging algorithms. A system of 8 nonlinear equations involving known quantities - like the total number of jets tagged in each sample - and 8 unknown quantities - like the \(b\)-tagging efficiency - can be written down and solved.

Before writing down the system of 8 equations we define the taggers and two samples more fully. The two taggers used must be as uncorrelated as possible. For this study we use the muon-in-jet tagger algorithm (SMT) [5] as one tagger. The SMT algorithm forms a 1-dimensional likelihood using the \(p_{T,rel}\) of the muon. In the present analysis an event is said to be tagged by the SMT tagger if the likelihood

Figure 6: Efficiency as a function of jet \(p_{T}\) (left) and jet \(|\eta|\) (right) for the tagger IP3D+SV1 as measured using the \(p_{T,rel}\) method. The dots are the true value as measured in the Monte Carlo, and the squares (with error bars) are determined from the \(p_{T,rel}\) method. The lines are parameterizations to the measured \(p_{T,rel}\) points. At high jet \(p_{T}\) the \(p_{T,rel}\) measurement technique fails and so we do not attempt to measure \(b\)-tagging performance above 80 GeV. The \(|\eta|\) plot (right) includes only jets with \(p_{T}<80\) GeV.

value is greater than 1.4. The second tagger, the one whose efficiency we want to measure is either the IP3D+SV1 or the IP2D algorithm. We abbreviate this second algorithm as "LT", short for "lifetime tagger".

The two samples are denoted the "n-sample" and the "p-sample." The n-sample is the full sample of jets containing a muon described in Section 2. The p-sample is a subset of the n-sample selected to have an enhanced \(b\)-content. A muon-tagged jet in the p-sample is required to have at least one back-to-back (\(\Delta\phi>2.5\)) lifetime-tagged (IP3D+SV1 weight \(>3\)) jet. This selection criterion increases the \(b\)-fraction of the p-sample relative to the n-sample by about a factor of two. The cuts for the p-sample were chosen to keep the statistics of the p-sample as large as possible and also to ensure the stability of the method.

### The 8 equations

Four numbers are measured in each sample: the number of jets before tagging (\(n\) in the n-sample, \(p\) in the p-sample), the number of jets tagged by the LT algorithm (\(n^{LT}\), \(p^{LT}\)), the number of jets tagged by the SMT algorithm (\(n^{SMT}\), \(p^{SMT}\)), and the number of jets tagged by both algorithms (\(n^{both}\), \(p^{both}\)).

While the total number of muon-tagged jets in each sample is an experimental observable, their flavor composition is not. We denote the number of \(b\)-jets in each sample as (\(n_{b}\), \(p_{b}\)) and \(c\)- and light-jets as (\(n_{cl}\), \(p_{cl}\)). The tagging efficiencies of the algorithms on the selected \(b\)-jets are (\(\epsilon_{b}^{LT}\), \(\epsilon_{b}^{SMT}\)) and non-\(b\)-jets tagging efficiencies are (\(\epsilon_{cl}^{LT}\), \(\epsilon_{cl}^{SMT}\)) -- which are also unknown. Unless otherwise stated, each efficiency is that which would apply to tagging of the n-sample.

These 8 quantities can be related by 8 equations. These equations also contain parameters encoding the extent to which the following assumptions are valid: that the efficiency of each tagger is the same on the n- and p-sample, and that the two tagging algorithms are uncorrelated. The parameters introduced are \(\alpha_{i}\) as follows:

\[\epsilon_{b}^{both} = \alpha_{1}\,\epsilon_{b}^{LT}\,\epsilon_{b}^{SMT} \tag{2}\] \[\epsilon_{cl}^{both} = \alpha_{2}\,\epsilon_{cl}^{LT}\,\epsilon_{cl}^{SMT}\] (3) \[\epsilon_{cl}^{SMT}\ (\mbox{on p-sample}) = \alpha_{3}\,\epsilon_{cl}^{SMT}\ (\mbox{on n-sample})\] (4) \[\epsilon_{cl}^{LT}\ (\mbox{on p-sample}) = \alpha_{4}\,\epsilon_{cl}^{LT}\ (\mbox{on n-sample})\] (5) \[\epsilon_{b}^{SMT}\ (\mbox{on p-sample}) = \alpha_{5}\,\epsilon_{b}^{SMT}\ (\mbox{on n-sample})\] (6) \[\epsilon_{b}^{LT}\ (\mbox{on p-sample}) = \alpha_{6}\,\epsilon_{b}^{LT}\ (\mbox{on n-sample}) \tag{7}\]

The \(\alpha_{1}\) and \(\alpha_{2}\) coefficients measure how correlated the two taggers are on \(b\)-jets and non-\(b\)-jets. The \(\alpha_{3}\), \(\alpha_{4}\), \(\alpha_{5}\), and \(\alpha_{6}\) are sensitive to any tag rate differences caused by the selection of the p-sample. The method is constructed in such a way that the \(\alpha_{i}\) should each be approximately unity. The values of the \(\alpha_{i}\) must be determined from Monte Carlo and possible differences of each \(\alpha_{i}\) from that in data must be included in the systematic error. The current method used to evaluate this systematic is described in Section 4.3.

The eight jet counts enumerated above can be related by the following eight equations, including the \(\alpha_{i}\):

\[n = n_{b}+n_{cl} \tag{8}\] \[p = p_{b}+p_{cl}\] (9) \[n^{LT} = \epsilon_{b}^{LT}\,n_{b}+\epsilon_{cl}^{LT}\,n_{cl}\] (10) \[p^{LT} = \alpha_{6}\,\epsilon_{b}^{LT}\,p_{b}+\alpha_{4}\,\epsilon_{cl}^{LT }\,p_{cl}\] (11) \[n^{SMT} = \epsilon_{b}^{SMT}\,n_{b}+\epsilon_{cl}^{SMT}\,n_{cl}\] (12) \[p^{SMT} = \alpha_{5}\,\epsilon_{b}^{SMT}\,p_{b}+\alpha_{3}\,\epsilon_{cl}^{ SMT}\,p_{cl} \tag{13}\]\[n^{both} = \alpha_{1}\,\varepsilon_{b}^{LT}\,\varepsilon_{b}^{SMT}\,n_{b}+ \alpha_{2}\,\varepsilon_{c}^{LT}\,\varepsilon_{cl}^{SMT}\,n_{cl} \tag{14}\] \[p^{both} = \alpha_{1}\,\alpha_{5}\,\alpha_{6}\,\varepsilon_{b}^{LT}\, \varepsilon_{b}^{SMT}\,p_{b}+\alpha_{2}\,\alpha_{3}\,\alpha_{4}\,\varepsilon_{ cl}^{LT}\,\varepsilon_{cl}^{SMT}\,p_{cl} \tag{15}\]

This system of eight equations (giving the method its name) is well specified if the value of each \(\alpha_{i}\) is known. The \(\varepsilon_{b}^{LT}\) is the unknown that is of most interest -- most of the others are not directly usable for other analysis. The System 8 method is based on a technique used by the D0 experiment at the Tevatron [10]. The CDF experiment has also used jet events to calibrate their lifetime \(b\)-tagging efficiency [12] using a different technique.

### Solving System 8, statistical error, and stability

Solving the system of 8 equations is in general straightforward with tools like Mathematica (analytical solution) or MINUIT (numerical solution). However, the nonlinearity of the 8 equations makes evaluating the statistical errors nontrivial. As a result Monte Carlo methods are employed. The System 8 observables, the jet counts \(\{n,p,n^{LT},p^{LT},n^{SMT},p^{SMT},n^{both},p^{both}\}\) are correlated; from them 8 uncorrelated jet counts \(\{x_{1},..,x_{8}\}\) are defined by dividing the n-sample into non-overlapping subsets. These parameters are varied according to Gaussian distributions with standard deviation \(\sqrt{x_{i}}\). The variation of all \(x_{i}\) was performed simultaneously assuming no correlations between them. The counts were varied in this way 100,000 times and the 8 equations were solved each time. The resulting distribution of \(\varepsilon_{b}^{LT}\) was used to determine the one-sigma statistical error. Statistical errors are shown for current Monte Carlo statistics in Table 5.

The System 8 solution is not well constrained when the equations are close to being linearly-dependent. As the equations near linear dependence, the System 8 solution becomes increasingly sensitive to statistical fluctuations, resulting in unreliable values of \(\varepsilon_{b}^{LT}\). The term'stability' will be used to describe the sensitivity of System 8 to statistical variations in the data.

The 8 equations are linearly independent as long as the \(b\)-content of the n- and p-samples differ, and as long as \(\varepsilon_{b}\neq\varepsilon_{cl}\) for both the SMT and LT tagging algorithms. In practice the first condition is easily met by construction of the p-sample (which requires a back-to-back \(b\)-tagged jet), but in the case of the SMT the second stability requirement (\(\varepsilon_{b}^{SMT}\neq\varepsilon_{cl}^{SMT}\)) becomes increasingly difficult to satisfy at high jet \(p_{T}\).

The SMT algorithm is highly correlated with the \(p_{T,rel}\) distribution of muons to distinguish between \(b\)-, \(c\)- and light-jets. These distributions become very similar at high jet \(p_{T}\) (see Fig. 4), leading to the poor ability of the SMT to separate \(b\) and non-\(b\)-jets at high momentum. It is for this reason we restrict the analysis to \(p_{T}<80\) GeV.

### Correlation systematic error

It is important to determine how well the Monte Carlo describes the \(\alpha_{i}\) in the data. Possible deviations should be reflected in the systematic error. We evaluate this contribution as the change in \(\varepsilon_{b}^{LT}\) obtained by shifting each \(\alpha_{i}\) from its value in Monte Carlo to unity. The total contribution to the systematic error, formed by adding the individual shifts in quadrature, is abbreviated as the correlation error.

Each \(\alpha_{i}\) is measured from Monte Carlo and the results are shown for the IP3D+SV1 tagger (\(w>4\)) in Table 4. The errors on each \(\alpha_{i}\) come only from Monte Carlo statistics. We have checked other tagging algorithms and weight cuts and the results are similar. It can be seen that only \(\alpha_{3}\) differs by much more than one sigma from unity, and the others lie within 3% of unity.

We vary each \(\alpha_{i}\) by \(\pm 0.01\) to give an idea of how each \(\alpha_{i}\) contributes to the error in \(\varepsilon_{b}^{LT}\). Table 4 shows that variations in \(\alpha_{2}\), \(\alpha_{4}\) and \(\alpha_{5}\) should have rather less impact on the \(b\)-tagging efficiency measurement than \(\alpha_{1}\), \(\alpha_{3}\) and \(\alpha_{6}\). The measured values of the coefficients \(\alpha_{1}\) and \(\alpha_{6}\) are statistically consistent with unity and show little statistically-significant dependence on jet \(p_{T}\) or SMT cut. The coefficient \(\alpha_{3}\), on the other hand, is not consistent with unity and shows a \(p_{T}\) dependence, and has a pronounced effect on the measured efficiency at high jet \(p_{T}\). The non-unity \(\alpha_{3}\) is understood to be primarily due to the different relative fractions of charm and light in the n- and p-samples.

In order to work out the correlation error we evaluate the shift in \(\Delta_{\varepsilon_{b}^{LT}}\) for a variation in \(\alpha_{i}\) of \(\pm(\alpha_{i}-1)\), as shown in Table 4. Adding the errors in quadrature gives an estimate of the correlation error of 6%. Larger Monte Carlo samples will help improve our understanding of this error and help better understand which \(\alpha_{i}\) really aren't unity.

### Tests on Monte Carlo

We evaluated the System 8 method on the muon+jet Monte Carlo sample, for the following standard ATLAS taggers: IP2D, and the default combination of IP3D+SV1 for jets with \(p_{T}<80\) GeV.

To derive \(p_{T}\) and \(\eta\) dependent efficiency curves, the System 8 method was applied in bins of \(p_{T}\) and \(\eta\). Due to lack of Monte Carlo statistics it is not currently possible to bin in both \(p_{T}\) and \(\eta\) simultaneously; instead, System 8 was tested in \(p_{T}\) bins for \(|\eta|<2.5\), and separately in \(\eta\) bins for \(15<p_{T}<80\) GeV. With larger Monte Carlo statistics and much larger data statistics (such as with 50 pb\({}^{-1}\)) we should have enough for four bins in \(p_{T}\) and four in \(|\eta|\) simultaneously for jet \(p_{T}<80\) GeV. The exact binning configuration will be optimized to give the best possible resolution at low jet \(p_{T}\) where the \(b\)-tagging efficiency is changing most rapidly. For this study, three bins in \(p_{T}\) (15-30 GeV, 30-50 GeV, 50-80 GeV), and four bins in \(|\eta|\) (0.0-0.5, 0.5-1.0, 1.0-1.5, 1.5-2.5) were considered.

Table 5 shows the results of calibrating the IP3D+SV1 tagger (\(w>\)4) and IP2D tagger (\(w>\)3) in bins of \(p_{T}\) and \(\eta\). The statistical error is shown. Recall the correlation error is an additional 6% which should be added in quadrature.

To conclude, System 8 works well for different types of lifetime tagging algorithms for jet \(p_{T}<80\) GeV. It demonstrates stable results for different cuts on \(b\)-tagging weights.

## 5 The inclusive \(b\)-tagging efficiency

This note describes two methods which measure the lifetime-tagging efficiency for \(b\)-jets containing muons. In this section we briefly discuss how to convert from the measured tag efficiency to a lifetime tagging efficiency relevant to inclusive jet samples.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|c||c|c|c|} \hline Assumption & Value (\(\alpha_{i}^{meas}\)) & \(\Delta_{\varepsilon_{b}}\) for \(\alpha_{i}=1\pm 0.01\) & \(\Delta_{\varepsilon_{b}}\) for \(\alpha_{i}=1\pm(\alpha_{i}^{meas}-1)\) \\ \hline \hline \(\alpha_{1}\) & \(1.016\pm 0.012\) & 0.027 & 0.043 \\ \(\alpha_{2}\) & \(1.018\pm 0.024\) & 0.002 & 0.004 \\ \(\alpha_{3}\) & \(1.052\pm 0.019\) & 0.006 & 0.031 \\ \(\alpha_{4}\) & \(1.028\pm 0.020\) & \(<0.001\) & \(<0.001\) \\ \(\alpha_{5}\) & \(1.011\pm 0.011\) & \(<0.001\) & \(<0.001\) \\ \(\alpha_{6}\) & \(1.005\pm 0.010\) & 0.016 & 0.008 \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 4: The \(\alpha\) coefficients measured on Monte Carlo for jet \(15<p_{T}<80\) GeV, for the IP3D+SV1 tagger weight \(w>4\) and SMT cut of 1.4 (\(\alpha_{i}^{meas}\)). The last two columns show how the \(b\)-tagging efficiency (\(\varepsilon_{b}\)) is affected by different variations in \(\alpha_{i}\): a 1% variation (\(\alpha_{i}=1\pm 0.01\)) and the measured offset of each \(\alpha_{i}\) from unity (\(\alpha_{i}=1\pm(\alpha_{i}^{meas}-1)\)). The change in \(\varepsilon_{b}\) is labeled \(\Delta_{\varepsilon_{b}}\). The latter column is added in quadrature to determine the total systematic error for the correlation error (see text).

Fig. 7 shows the ratio of the muon-jet lifetime tag rate to the inclusive-jet tag rate for the default IP3D+SV1 tagger (\(w>4\)) as a function of \(p_{T}\). The difference between the tag rates in the two samples is primarily due to about a 50% difference in the \(p_{T}\) of the highest \(p_{T}\) track and in the average number of tracks per jet.

We define a scale factor, \(S_{b}\), to describe the difference in tag rates. The scale factor is defined in Monte Carlo:

\[\epsilon_{b\to\mathrm{had}}^{MC}(p_{T},\eta)=S_{b}(p_{T},\eta) \epsilon_{b\to\ell\nu X}^{MC}(p_{T},\eta) \tag{16}\]

and thus, given a hadronic Monte Carlo \(b\)-jet, one calculates its calibrated lifetime tagging efficiency as follows:

\[\epsilon_{b\to\mathrm{had}}(p_{T},\eta)=\epsilon_{b}(p_{T},\eta) S_{b\to\mathrm{had}}(p_{T},\eta) \tag{17}\]

where \(\epsilon_{b}\) is the tagging efficiency measured with System 8 or \(p_{T,rel}\) in muon-tagged jets.

To understand the systematic error on the scale factor we need a better understanding of the causes of the differences in tag rate. This work is in progress.

## 6 Conclusions

We have presented two methods to calibrate lifetime \(b\)-tagging algorithms using dijet data. Trigger studies were performed in order to assure that there will be enough data for the \(b\)-tagging calibration. Detailed \(b\)-tagging performance can be obtained with data corresponding to 50 pb\({}^{-1}\) of integrated luminosity.

The suggested methods, \(p_{T,rel}\) and System 8, were studied using Monte Carlo jet events, at least one of which has an associated muon. Good agreement is observed between true semi-leptonic \(b\)-tagging efficiency and that measured by \(p_{T,rel}\) and System 8. Both methods were verified in different jet \(\eta\) and \(p_{T}\) regions. We found that the current version of the \(p_{T,rel}\) method can be used for jets below 80 GeV in entire \(\eta\) region. System 8 was also proved to work well up to 80 GeV in the entire \(\eta\) region.

\end{table}
Table 5: Measured efficiencies, the statistical error, and their deviation from the true efficiencies in bins of \(p_{T}\) and \(\eta\), as described in the text. The statistical error is for the muon+jet Monte Carlo statistics. The correlation error, estimated to be \(\pm\)0.06, must be added as well.

The total error of both methods is expected to be rapidly dominated by systematic uncertainties. The systematic errors studied so far indicate that both methods should be able to control the absolute error on \(\varepsilon_{b}\) to 6%. The additional systematic uncertainties associated with converting the semi-leptonic efficiency to the inclusive efficiency have not yet been determined The two methods are complementary to those discussed in [1], in that they are most useful in measuring the turn-on of the \(b\)-tagging efficiency at low jet \(p_{T}\).
