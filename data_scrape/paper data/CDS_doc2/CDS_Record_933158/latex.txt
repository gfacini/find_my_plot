**Abstract**

A study of sensitivity of the \(e/h\) ratio of the ATLAS Hadronic Tile Calorimeter to the proton contamination in the positive pion beams has been performed. It turned out that the joint application of the proton contamination correction and the correction on the event selection criteria to the \(e/\pi\) ratios leads to unchanged value of the e/h ratio: \(e/h=1.36\pm 0.01\).

Introduction

The value of \(e/h\) ratio for the ATLAS Hadronic Tile Calorimeter was determined on basis of the July 1999 test beam data. The analysis carried out in the work [1] led to the value \(e/h=1.36\pm 0.01\). In the mentioned test beam the setup (Fig. 1) was exposed to the electrons and pion beams with energies 10, 20, 50, 80, 100, 150, 180, 300 GeV at different pseudo-rapidities: \(\eta\) = -0.15, -0.25, -0.35, -0.45, -0.55.

A drawback of that setup was that its structure did not guarantee full containment of hadronic shower, what was critical especially for high energies. Therefore, we were forced to reject the events with a longitudinal energy leakage by applying some selection criteria: the relative energy deposition in the first depth sampling was required to be \(S_{1}>15\%\) of the total and the relative energy deposition in the first two depth samplings needed to be: \(S_{2}>50\%\) of the total [1].

Fig. 2 shows the experimental \(e/h\) ratio corrected for the longitudinal energy leakage (black boxes) and the uncorrected one (open boxes) as a function of \(\eta\)[1]. It can be seen that the corrections lead to the smaller values of the \(e/h\) ratio that does not exhibit any \(\eta\) - dependence.

It should be noted that at energies 50 - 180 GeV the beam of positive pions was used. Later the works of S.Dita et al. [2, 3] appeared in which an impact of the proton contamination to the positive pion beams on the \(e/h\) ratio has been estimated. We have exploited some results of these works to obtain the corresponding corrections.

## 2 Proton contamination correction

Using the results of the analysis carried out by S.Dita et al. [2, 3] we have obtained the following corrections for the proton contamination of the pion beams used in the \(e/h\) analysis:

\[\left(\frac{e}{\pi}\right)_{exp}=\frac{R_{e}}{f_{\pi}\cdot R_{\pi}+f_{p}\cdot R _{p}}=\left(\frac{R_{e}}{R_{\pi}}\right)\cdot\frac{1}{f_{\pi}+f_{p}\cdot\left( \frac{R_{p}}{R_{\pi}}\right)}\, \tag{1}\]

\[\left(\frac{e}{\pi}\right)_{cor}=\left(\frac{e}{\pi}\right)_{exp}\cdot K_{p}\, \tag{2}\]Figure 1: Sketch of the test beam setup.

\[K_{p}=f_{\pi}+f_{p}\cdot\left(\frac{R_{p}}{R_{\pi}}\right)\,, \tag{3}\]

where \(R_{e}\) is the electron response, \(f_{\pi}\) (\(f_{p}\)) is the pion (proton) fraction in the beam and \(R_{p}/R_{\pi}\) is the proton/pion response ratio.

A dependence of the pion and proton fraction as a function of energy is shown in Fig. 3 and the same dependence for the proton/pion response ratio is depicted in Fig. 4. From that we see that the mean pion response is greater than the proton one. This fact can be attributed to the greater electromagnetic fraction (\(\pi^{0}\)'s) in pion showers than in the proton ones -- that is connected with the requirement of baryon number conservation in the shower development [5, 6].

The obtained corrections factors are given in Fig. 5 (black boxes).

## 3 Corrections for the selection criteria

Another type of corrections we need to cope with are those connected with the selection criteria applied at the level of the signal reconstruction.

## 5 Conclusions

A study of the impact of the proton contamination in the positive pion beams and the event selection criteria on determination of the \(e/h\) ratio from the test beam experimental data, has been performed. It turned out that the joint application of the corrections to the \(e/\pi\) ratio taking into account two effects leads to unchanged value of the e/h ratio: \(e/h=1.36\pm 0.01\).
