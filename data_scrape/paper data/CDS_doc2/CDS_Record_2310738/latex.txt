## 1 Introduction

The ATLAS collaboration has recently published very precise measurements of various observables related to Drell-Yan production of the weak vector bosons at centre-of-mass energies of 7 TeV and 8 TeV. These comprise in particular:

* fiducial differential measurements of the \(W^{+}\)-, \(W^{-}\)-, and \(Z\)-boson cross sections [1];
* measurements of the angular coefficients \(A_{0}\) to \(A_{7}\) describing the angular distributions of the decay leptons in the \(Z\)-boson centre of mass [2]; these coefficients are defined in the full phase space of Born-level leptons in the centre-of-mass of the \(Z\)-boson decay, and the measurements are performed differentially as a function of the \(Z\)-boson transverse momentum and in several dilepton rapidity (\(y^{Z}\)) bins for dilepton masses \(m^{Z}\) between 80 and 100 GeV;
* measurements of the forward-backward asymmetry in \(Z\)-boson decays at 8 TeV [3]; these measurements are derived from fiducial cross-section measurements performed triple differentially and over a wide range in dilepton mass, dilepton rapidity and lepton polar angle in the centre of mass of the \(Z\) boson decay.

Given the accuracy (in many cases sub-percent) of the above measurements, very precise theoretical calculations are of paramount importance for the extraction of fundamental parameters of the Standard Model such as the \(W\)-boson mass, \(m_{W}\), and the weak mixing angle, \(\sin^{2}\theta_{W}\), from the experimental data. One frequently discussed aspect within the community is the imperfect knowledge of the parton distribution functions (PDFs) of the proton and of their impact on recent and future measurements of these parameters. This note presents studies based on ATLAS simulations to foster discussion on some of the issues related to the theory used in various PDF fits and on the impact of the PDFs and of their uncertainties on some of the most precise measurements published by ATLAS to-date.

This note consists of two independent studies. The first section discusses in some detail the behaviour of different PDF sets when studying angular coefficients in \(Z\)-boson decay angular distributions, which can be interpreted in terms of the weak mixing angle, while the second section presents the impact of resummation on the predictions for fiducial differential \(W\)-and \(Z\)-boson cross sections.

Impact of PDFs and their uncertainties on the measurement of \(\sin^{2}\theta_{W}\) using the angular coefficient \(A_{4}\) in \(Z\)-boson decays

In order to achieve a high precision on the measurement of the weak mixing angle, \(\sin^{2}\theta_{W}\), at the LHC, it is very important to minimise the impact of the uncertainties arising from the imperfect knowledge of the PDFs. The experimental observables used for this measurement are the forward-backward asymmetry \(A_{FB}\)[3] and the related angular coefficient \(A_{4}\), as defined in Eq. 1 of Ref. [2]. The distribution of \(A_{FB}\) is usually measured in the fiducial volume defined by experimental lepton selection requirements. In contrast, the angular coefficient \(A_{4}\) is defined in the full phase space of Born-level leptons in the centre-of-mass of the \(Z\)-boson decay, and is probed experimentally in the accessible range of the \(Z\)-boson rapidity \(y^{Z}\), which extends in ATLAS over \(|y^{Z}|<2.5\) for events containing two electrons or muons in the central region of the detector and over \(1.6<|y^{Z}|<3.6\) for events with one electron in the forward region of the detector. In this phase space, \(A_{FB}=3/8\cdot A_{4}\) and both quantities are directly related to the vector couplings of the \(Z\)-boson to fermions and therefore sensitive to the value of \(\sin^{2}\theta_{W}\). Thesensitivity of these two observables to \(\sin^{2}\theta_{W}\) is very strongly reduced at the LHC compared to the Tevatron by the lack of knowledge of the parent quark direction in the centre-of-mass system of the \(Z\)-boson decay (this direction has to be inferred from the sign of \(y^{Z}\)). This reduction of sensitivity is strongest at low values of \(|y^{Z}|\), leading to enhanced sensitivity of this measurement for events produced at high \(|y^{Z}|\) and also to large sensitivity to the PDFs over the full accessible \(y^{Z}\) range, as shown below.

The simulations described in this section are based on the Dres program [4], which provides one of the most advanced resummed calculations of \(W/Z\)-boson production. An optimised version of this program has been developed by ATLAS and is used in the following to predict the variation of \(A_{4}\) as a function of \(\sin^{2}\theta_{W}\) at leading order electroweak and at next-to-leading order (NLO) in QCD. The variations considered in \(\sin^{2}\theta_{W}\) are around the world-average value of Ref. [5]. The PDF sets considered here are those labelled as CT10 [6], CT14 [7], MMHT14 [8], NNPDF31 [9], and ATLAS-epWZ16 [1]. Figure 1 shows the predicted distributions, at next-to-leading order (NLO) accuracy in QCD, for the angular coefficient \(A_{4}\) as a function of \(m^{Z}\) and of \(y^{Z}\) for five sets of PDFs, among which the CT10 set was chosen as a reference against which to compare the predictions from the other PDF sets. Also shown in Fig. 1 are the uncertainties in each prediction. Based on these comparisons and those illustrated in Figs. 2 and 3, which show for each of the PDF sets the valence and sea quark contributions versus \(x\) at the \(Z\)-boson scale, \(Q^{2}=m_{Z}^{2}\), the following observations can be made:

* The ATLAS-epWZ2016 PDF set departs significantly in its predictions from the other PDF sets for large values of \(m^{Z}\) and high values of \(y^{Z}\), including NNPDF31, which is the only other PDF set having already included the most precise measurements of the Drell-Yan differential inclusive cross-sections from Ref. [1].
* This difference is significant when comparing only to the uncertainty bands from the other PDF sets, as can be seen by comparing the middle and bottom parts of Fig. 1.
* As shown in Figs. 2 and 3, this difference most likely arises from the large difference in the down quark valence contributions in the relevant range of \(x\) between the ATLAS epWZ16 PDF set and those of the other PDF sets. The latter are likely constrained more strongly in this region by lower-energy data, in particular by the \(W\)-boson asymmetry measurements at the Tevatron [10].

Figure 4 shows for various PDF sets the expected correlations due to the PDF uncertainties between the predicted values of \(A_{4}\) as a function of \(y^{Z}\). These correlations are clearly strong and positive between neighbouring \(y^{Z}\) bins but some negative correlations can be seen between distant \(y^{Z}\) bins. The relative importance of the positive and negative correlations is not the same for the different PDF sets: the CT14 set displays the strongest contributions from negative correlations while the NNPDF31 and ATLAS-epWZ16 sets display the weakest ones, with the MMHT14 set situated in between. Since the experimental measurements are performed in \(m^{Z}\) and \(y^{Z}\) bins, the pattern of these correlations will play an important role in the final impact of the PDF uncertainties on the extraction of the weak mixing angle. The corresponding figures as a function of \(m^{Z}\) display a strong anti-correlation structure between values of \(m^{Z}\) above and below the point where the predicted value of \(A_{4}\) changes sign. This feature has already been exploited in recent CMS results on the weak mixing angle [11].

Figures 5 to 8 summarise the impact of the differences between PDF sets and of their uncertainties, before and after performing the fits, on the interpretation of the measurement of the angular coefficient, \(A_{4}\), as a measurement of the weak mixing angle. This is performed by using a given PDF set to predict \(A_{4}\) as a function of \(\sin^{2}\theta_{W}\), while fitting pseudodata generated with a different PDF set.

Figure 1: For different PDF sets, distributions of the predicted angular coefficient \(A_{4}\) (top), of the difference between the various predictions and a reference one chosen as the CT10 PDF set (middle), and uncertainties in \(A_{4}\) obtained from the different PDF sets (bottom). The distributions are shown as a function of the dilepton mass \(m^{Z}\) (left) and of the dilepton rapidity \(y^{Z}\) (right).

Figure 3: For the PDF sets considered in this note, ratios with respect to the corresponding reference distributions of Ref. [6] for the sea quarks: up (left), down (middle), and strange (right).

Figure 2: For the PDF sets considered in this note, distributions of the expected contributions from the up (top) and down (bottom) valence quarks of the proton as a function of \(x\) at the scale of the \(Z\)-boson, \(Q^{2}=m_{Z}^{2}\) (left). Also shown are the ratios of these distributions to the corresponding reference one of Ref. [6] (right).

The fit itself is performed always to pseudodata in the analysis bins and not in the binning of the distributions in the figures. The analysis considers three bins in \(m^{Z}\) between 70, 80, 100, and 125 GeV, along with four bins in \(|y^{Z}|\) between 0, 0.8, 1.6, 2.5, and 3.6. The events with both leptons in the central region of the detector (labelled as \(ee_{CC}\) and \(\mu\mu_{CC}\)) cover the \(Z\)-boson rapidity region between 0 and 2.5, while the events containing one electron in the forward region (labelled as \(ee_{CF}\)) cover the \(Z\)-boson rapidity region between 1.6 and 3.6. The pseudodata are generated only with the statistical uncertainties expected for the ATLAS 8 TeV dataset to maximise the sensitivity of the study to differences between PDF sets and to their respective uncertainties.

The results of the fits can be expressed as a non-closure in the parameter of interest, namely the weak mixing angle, since the angular coefficient \(A_{4}\) is predicted as a function of \(\sin^{2}\theta_{W}\). Over a range of \(\pm\) 100 \(\times\) 10\({}^{-5}\) around the world average value of the weak mixing angle, a linear function, \(A4=a\times sin^{2}\theta_{W}+b\), describes the predictions for each PDF set to an accuracy of better than 10\({}^{-5}\), and the values of the coefficients, \(a\) and \(b\), used are shown in Table 1 as an example for the case of \(A_{4}\) integrated over all the measurement bins defined above. The results of the fits (best fit values of the weak mixing angle and of the PDF uncertainties) can thus be extrapolated back to predict the value of \(A_{4}\) in any region of the \(Z\)-boson phase space and in particular to produce the curves in the kinematic binning chosen for Figs. 5 to 8.

As an example, Fig. 5 shows the differences before (pre-fit) and after (post-fit) performing the fits between the values of \(A_{4}\) as a function of \(m^{Z}\) and of \(y^{Z}\). The pre-fit differences are represented as the set of blue

Figure 4: Correlations between the predicted angular coefficient \(A_{4}\) as a function of \(y^{Z}\), shown for the CT14 (top left), MMHT14 (top right), NNPDF31 (bottom left), and ATLAS epWZ16 (bottom right) PDF sets. The colour scale runs over the whole range from \(+1\) (yellow) to \(-1\) (blue).

The differences between the pre-fit and post-fit values of \(A_{4}\) as shown in Figs. 5 to 8 can be summarised numerically for all possible pairs of PDF sets, as shown in Table 2, for the most interesting case where all events are considered, including those with one electron in the forward region of the detector. The summary is obtained by integrating \(A_{4}\) over all the measurement bins defined above. For such an integrated measurement, the expected statistical precision of the 8 TeV dataset is approximately \(10^{-3}\) so the predictions and differences between pseudodata and fit results shown in Table 2 are expressed in units of \(10^{-3}\). These differences in \(A_{4}\) can then be interpreted, as shown in Tables 3 and 4, as a non-closure in the weak mixing angle. A significant fraction of these values could a priori be compared for the case of events with both leptons in the central region of the detector to the post-fit uncertainties of approximately \(30\times 10^{-5}\) from PDFs reported recently by CMS [11], but these numbers should not be directly compared since the simulations described here include on purpose only statistical uncertainties to maximise the impact of the PDF predictions and their uncertainties on the fit results.

Figure 5: Differences between the fitted angular coefficient \(A_{4}\) and the predicted value as a function of \(m^{Z}\) (top) and of \(y^{Z}\) (bottom), using only leptons in the central region (left) and including also electrons in the forward region (right). The reference prediction used for the fit is that of the CT14 PDF set (black points with shaded PDF uncertainty band) centred at zero) and the pseudodata (blue points with shaded PDF uncertainty band) are obtained using MMHT14. Three fit results are shown: the first one (red points labelled as “s2w fit”), where only the parameter of interest, \(\sin^{2}\theta_{W}\), is allowed to vary, the second one (brown points labelled as “NPs fit”), where only the PDF parameters are allowed to vary, and finally the complete fit (green points labelled as “s2w+NPs fit”) where all parameters are allowed to vary together. As explained in the text, only statistical uncertainties, as expected from the ATLAS 8 TeV dataset, are included in the fits (systematic experimental and theoretical uncertainties from the actual expected measurement of \(A_{4}\) are not included here to maximise the sensitivity to the choice of PDFs and their related uncertainties).

Resummation effects in QCD predictions of fiducial differential \(W\)- and \(Z\)-boson cross sections

As discussed in the introduction, the results from ATLAS at 7 TeV [1] include the most precise measurements of inclusive \(W\)- and \(Z\)-boson production at the LHC, through differential cross sections defined within the fiducial volume:

* \(p_{\rm T}^{\ell}>25\) GeV, \(|\eta_{\ell}|<2.5\), \(p_{\rm T}^{\nu}>25\) GeV and \(m_{\rm T}>40\) GeV for \(W\) production, and
* \(p_{\rm T}^{\ell}>20\) GeV, \(|\eta_{\ell}|<2.5\) and \(66<m_{\ell\ell}<116\) GeV for \(Z\) production.

The shapes and ratios of these cross sections are measured with a precision of approximately 0.5% as a function of lepton pseudorapidity for \(W\to\ell\nu\) decays and lepton-pair rapidity for \(Z\to\ell\ell\) decays.

One of the main purposes of these measurements is to provide constraints on the proton PDFs, through QCD fits to the measured cross sections. In the fit procedure, hadron-level fiducial cross sections are calculated by convoluting partonic cross sections with the proton PDFs, where the latter are adjusted to optimise the agreement between the calculated and measured cross sections. For recent fits [7, 8, 9, 12, 13], the partonic cross sections were calculated at next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) accuracy in QCD.

While fixed-order calculations are well adapted to predict precisely cross sections in the full phase space of the decay products of the vector bosons, they display an unphysical behaviour of the \(p_{\rm T}^{W/Z}\) distribution, characterised by an infrared divergence when \(p_{\rm T}^{W/Z}\) approaches the cutoff of the calculation. This leads to a negative cross section for values of \(p_{\rm T}^{W/Z}\) below the cutoff, while the \(p_{\rm T}^{W/Z}\)-integrated cross section does not depend on the value of the cut-off. When selection requirements are applied to the leptons from the vector boson decay, this unphysical behaviour potentially biases the calculation of fiducial cross sections.

Predictions with a realistic \(p_{\rm T}^{W/Z}\) distribution can be obtained using parton-shower Monte Carlo programs [14, 15, 16], or combining fixed-order predictions with analytical resummation [17]. Among the programs implementing the latter approach, Dyres[4] provides one of the most advanced resummed calculations with NNLO+NNLL accuracy in QCD. The description of the \(p_{\rm T}^{W/Z}\) distribution is thereby improved at low values of \(p_{\rm T}^{W/Z}\), and the normalisation of the cross section calculated at NNLO in the full phase space is preserved. An optimised version of this program has been developed by ATLAS and is used in the following to evaluate the impact of the improved behaviour of the \(p_{\rm T}^{W/Z}\) distribution on the predicted fiducial cross sections. The CT10 PDF set from [6] has been used here: it should be noted that this choice is largely irrelevant for the ratios reported below since the impact of different choices of PDFs largely cancels.

Figure 9 compares predictions for the \(W^{+}\)-, \(W^{-}\)- and \(Z\)-boson fiducial differential cross sections calculated with and without including resummation corrections, at NLO and NNLO perturbative accuracy. Comparing NLO+NLL to pure NLO predictions, differences of up to 1.5% are observed when including resummation corrections: the NLO \(W^{+}\)-boson cross section is overestimated by 1% on average, increasing from 0.5% to 1.5% over the measured lepton \(|\eta|\) range; for \(W^{-}\), the NLO calculation overestimates the fiducial cross section by 0.5%, uniformly over the lepton \(|\eta|\) range. The \(Z\)-boson NLO+NLL to NLO cross-section ratio has a non-uniform behaviour, with an amplitude of about 1%. These features are qualitatively preserved when comparing NNLO+NNLL to NNLO predictions, but the amplitude of the effects is reduced by typically a factor of two.

The size of the remaining effects is commensurate with the precision of the experimental results, which implies that the accuracy of the fixed-order partonic cross sections becomes a limiting factor in the interpretation of the measurements. This difficulty may be overcome in the future by including resummation corrections in the calculations used to perform PDF fits on this type of data or by further improvements in the calculations providing the fixed-order predictions.

Figure 9: Ratio between resummed and fixed-order fiducial cross sections, for \(W^{+}\) (top), \(W^{-}\) (middle) and \(Z\) (bottom) boson production. These cross sections are shown differentially as a function of lepton pseudorapidity \(|\eta|\) for \(W\)-boson decays and of dilepton rapidity \(y\) for \(Z\)-boson decays. The full (black) and open (red) circles show the NLO+NLL to NLO and NNLO+NNLL to NNLO ratios from theoretical calculations, respectively, as explained in the text. These fiducial cross sections are defined by \(p_{\rm T}^{\ell}>25\) GeV, \(|\eta_{\ell}|<2.5\), \(p_{\rm T}^{\nu}>25\) GeV and \(m_{\rm T}>40\) GeV for \(W\to\ell\nu\) decays, and by \(p_{\rm T}^{\ell}>20\) GeV, \(|\eta_{\ell}|<2.5\) and \(66<m_{\ell\ell}<116\) GeV for \(Z\to\ell\ell\) decays.
