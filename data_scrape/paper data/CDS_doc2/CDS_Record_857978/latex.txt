**Outer Wheel Uniformity of the ElectroMagnetic Endcap Calorimeter**

C. Oliver, J. del Peso

Universidad Autonoma de Madrid (UAM)

An analysis of the test beam data for the uniformity of three ECC modules is presented. A non-uniformity of less than 0.6% is obtained for the outer wheel of the three modules. The results are found to be independent of the signal reconstruction method used as long as the residuals are kept below 4%.

Introduction

The Electromagnetic Endcap Calorimeter (EMEC) is a general purpose sampling calorimeter with stringent performance requirements demanded by the detection of the Higgs through the decay channels \(H\to\gamma\gamma\,\ \ H\to 4e\). The global constant term of the energy resolution must be \(\leq 0.7\%\) over the pseudorapidity (\(\eta\)) region 1.5 - 2.5 [1]. To achieve this resolution a cell-to-cell non-uniformity cannot exceed 0.6%.

In summer 1999 the Module 0 prototype was tested at CERN using electron beams. Unfortunately, only a small region of the module could be equiped with electrodes hence the study of the uniformity could not be performed for this prototype. The test was then devoted to energy and position resolutions and uniformities restricted to very small regions only [2].

In summer 2001 two (ECC0, ECC1) and in spring 2002 one (ECC5) production final modules were tested using electron beams at CERN. For the three modules the cell-to-cell non-uniformities were measured over the full coverage. After a first preliminary analysis at UAM [3], two analysis of these data have run in paralell and independently, one of the CPPM group and another of the UAM group. The former has already been published as an ATLAS note [4].

The present note summarizes the results obtained by the UAM group concerning the uniformity of the three modules tested (ECC0,ECC1,ECC5). Only the region devoted to precision physics (\(\eta<2.5\)) is studied in this note.

## 2 Geometry of modules

Only the information of the EMEC geometry that is of interest for the present analysis is presented in this section. For more details on the geometry see [5].

The EMEC is a sampling calorimeter with lead as absorber or passive material and Liquid ARgon (LAR) as an active material. An accordion shape is given to all plates in order to avoid crack regions due to cables and boards of the readout. There are two EMEC cylinders in ATLAS located inside the Endcap Cryostat at \(z\sim\pm 350\) cm of the nominal interaction point. Since the EMEC is a cylindrical wheel, the amplitude of the accordion waves decreases when \(\eta\) increases (when the radius decreases). Due to mechanical constraints demanded by this accordion shape, a second independent wheel is needed to extend the coverage to \(\eta=3.2\). Hence, there are two wheels, the outer wheel from \(\eta=1.375\) to \(\eta=2.5\) and the inner wheel from \(\eta=2.5\) to \(\eta=3.2\). The lead is cladded by 0.2 mm thick steel to give it enough rigidity. The LAR ionization is collected by electrodes situated in between two absorbers. For the outer wheel, the thickness of the lead plates is 1.7 mm while the LAR gap thickness between the absorber and the electrode decreases continously from 2.8 mm (at \(\eta=1.375\)) to 0.9 mm (at \(\eta=2.5\)) when \(\eta\) increases 1. To keep the electrode in the right place, honeycomb spacers are located in between the absorber and the electrode.

Footnote 1: For the inner wheel, the thickness of the lead plates is 2.2 mm while the LAR gap thickness between the absorber and the electrode decreases continously from 3.1 mm (at \(\eta=2.5\)) to 1.8 mm (at \(\eta=3.2\)) when \(\eta\) increases.

To facilitate handling and logistics the EMEC cylinder is divided into 8 octants or modules. The 16 modules have been stacked in the CPPM 2 and UAM 3 clean rooms.

Footnote 2: Centre de Physique des Particules de Marseille

Footnote 3: Universidad Autónoma de Madrid

One module consists of 96 (32) layers for the outer (inner) wheel stacked one on top of each other. Each layer is a sandwich of absorber, spacer (gap), electrode, spacer (gap). The design is symmetrical in \(\phi\) and projective to the interaction point in \(\eta\). In particular the cells drawn in the electrodes point to the nominal ATLAS interaction point.

One module has 3888 readout channels or cells divided in 3 samplings, Front (S1), Middle (S2) and Back (S3), with the segmentation on the \((\eta,\phi)\) plane shown in table 1. The \(\eta\)-granularity is defined in the electrodes as copper strips using kapton as electrical isolator between two strips and between signal and high voltage copper strips. The \(\phi\)-segmentation is defined by connecting the signal paths of \(n\) electrodes corresponding to \(n\) layers, using Summing Boards. For the outer wheel 3 layers (\(2\pi/256\)) form a \(\phi\) cell for the middle and back samplings and 12 layers (\(2\pi/64\)) build a cell for the front sampling.

A schematic view of the module segmentation is plotted in figure 1. The three samplings Front, Middle and Back are denoted by s1, s2, s3 respectively. Cell numbers for the three samplings are indicated along \(\eta\) (abscissas) and along \(\phi\) (ordinates). The correspondance between \(\eta\) (\(\phi\)) cell number and \(\eta\)-units (\(\phi\)-radians) can be obtained easily for the 3 samplings.

## 3 Beam Test Setup

Modules ECC0 and ECC1 were tested in summer 2001 and module ECC5 in May-June 2002 in the H6 beam line of the North Experimental Area at CERN. A description of the experimental beam test setup can be found in reference [2]. The system was equipped with motors to move the module along the two orthogonal directions \(\eta\) and \(\phi\) independently, keeping the projectivity of the cells to the nominal ATLAS interaction point. A 119.1 GeV electron beam was used to study the calorimeter response as a function of the point of incidence. Runs of 10000 events were taken with the beam incident at the center of every middle cell. The beam spot size of about \(\pm 2\) cm in both x,y directions was sufficient to completely cover the size of one middle cell in the outer wheel. The beam momentum spread was \(\sim\) 0.07%.

The beam line was instrumented with 2 scintillator counters behind the calorimeter, which were used to identify and eventualy reject residual pions and muons within the beam. There were also scintillator counters in front of the calorimeter that were used for the trigger and to obtain the arrival time of the incident particle (thereafter called TDC time).

## 4 Calorimeter response

A simplified schematic view of the calorimeter readout is shown in figure 2. The detector cell is represented by a capacitance \(C\) where a triangular ionization signal (\(I_{p}(t)\)) is generated by the detected particle. Also linked to a cell there appears an inductance \(L\) due to the electrode, the Summing-Board and a small portion of the Mother-Board. The signal travels through a \(25\Omega\) cable in case of a middle or a back cell and a \(50\Omega\) cable in case of a front cell. Immediately after the feedthrough of the cryostat the signal enters a Front-End-Board (FEB) and pass through a three gain shaper with division factors 1, 9.3 and 93 corresponding to high, medium and low gain respectively. The measured shaped signal \(D(t)\) is sampled by a Switch Capacitor Array (SCA) located in the FEB at a frequency of 40 MHz (equivalent to a period of 25 ns), that is the nominal bunch crossing frequency of LHC beams. The

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|} \hline Wheel & \(\eta\) range & Front & Middle & Back \\ \hline  & 1.375 - 1.425 & (0.050,2\(\pi/64\)) & (0.050,2\(\pi/256\)) & \\  & 1.425 - 1.5 & (0.025,2\(\pi/64\)) & (0.025,2\(\pi/256\)) & \\ Outer & 1.5 - 1.8 & (0.003,2\(\pi/64\)) & (0.025,2\(\pi/256\)) & (0.050,2\(\pi/256\)) \\  & 1.8 - 2.0 & (0.004,2\(\pi/64\)) & (0.025,2\(\pi/256\)) & (0.050,0.2\(\pi/256\)) \\  & 2.0 - 2.4 & (0.006,2\(\pi/64\)) & (0.025,2\(\pi/256\)) & (0.050,2\(\pi/256\)) \\  & 2.4 - 2.5 & (0.025,2\(\pi/64\)) & (0.025,2\(\pi/256\)) & (0.050,2\(\pi/256\)) \\ Inner & 2.5 - 3.2 & & (0.1,2\(\pi/64\)) & (0.1,2\(\pi/64\)) \\ \hline \end{tabular}

samples are digitized by ADCs located in the FEB and the numbers are transmitted to the miniROD and the DAQ computing system in the control room.

Out of the seven samples stored per cell, only five of them are used in the reconstruction of the maximum of the signal (or signal amplitude) as will be explained in the next section 4. Since the beam energy is below 300 GeV, only the samples from both high and medium gain signals are recorded. A gain selection is applied by software, namely for those cells with signal amplitude below (above) saturation the high (medium) gain response is chosen 5.

Footnote 4: The signal amplitude is proportional to the energy deposited by the particle in the cell.

Footnote 5: The saturation of the high gain response occurs at about 20 GeV

The time (\(t_{TDC}\)) between the trigger and the next leading edge of the 40 MHz clock is used as a time reference for the digitized samples. Since the test beam is asynchronous, this reference time \(t_{TDC}\) differs from event to event which allows to determine the data pulse shape \(D(t)\) of a cell by representing the sample heights as a function of \(t_{TDC}\)6. This permits to perform studies on signal reconstruction methods (see next section). To guarantee the electron purity on the signal, standard selection cuts are applied to veto the small contamination from muons and pions in the beam line, cosmics and random triggers [2]. In addition, for signal reconstruction studies, the reconstructed barycenter position is demanded to be at the center of the cell with a 30% tolerance. This assures that the physics pulse \(D(t)\) corresponds to only one calorimeter cell. For the uniformity study this cut is not applied.

Footnote 6: In the LHC the beams will be synchronous

A diagram of one calibration line is also shown in figure 2. An exponential signal (\(I_{c}(t)\)) is generated in the Calibration Board playing the role of the triangular ionization signal (\(I_{p}\)) of physics events. The signal \(I_{c}\) pass the feedthrough to get into the cryostat and travels through a long cable up to the Mother-Board. The calibration signal sees the detector cell as a capacitance and an inductance as

Figure 2: _Schematic view of the calorimeter readout electronics (taken from [7])._

indicated in figure 2. The response to this injection signal continues through the same readout line as the ionization signal to reach the SCA. The output is again seven samples of the shaped signal \(P_{c}(t)\) after being digitized by the ADC.

The calibration boards allow to set the amplitude of injected current \(I_{c}\) numerically. A DAC unit, included in the calibration board, transforms this number into an analog amplitude. We will refer to this number as DAC value. The calibration board is equipped with a delay unit, which allows to delay the injection from 0 to 24 ns in steps of 1 ns with respect to the leading edge of the 40 MHz clock (\(t_{delay}\)). The calibration pulse \(P_{c}(t)\) is obtained by representing the sample heights as a function of \(t_{delay}\). 7. These delay runs were taken during periods when the beam was off. Delay runs in medium (high) gain with a DAC value of 10000 (1000) units are considered for the signal reconstruction studies. Since the response to DAC=0 is not zero [6], the calibration signal pulses for DAC=10000 (DAC=1000) and DAC=0 are substracted. This should cancel spurious effects on the shape of \(P_{c}(t)\) introduced by the calibration board electronics.

Footnote 7: Every sample height is an average over 100 events taken for a given delay

## 5 Signal reconstruction

The maximum of the signal pulse is obtained from the recorded samplings applying the Optimal Filtering (OF) procedure. This procedure needs the knowledge of the exact shape of the signal for each calorimeter cell. However, this shape (\(D(t)\)) is known only for the cells of the 3 modules tested with beams. Therefore a procedure to reconstruct \(D(t)\) from a calibration pulse shape \(P_{c}(t)\) is forseen for the cells of all modules installed in ATLAS. The first signal reconstruction method was developed by the LAPP group for EMBarrel beam test studies [7]. In this section we describe briefly the numerical approach used in the LAPP method that is relevant for the last section of this note. For further details see [7]. We also define the maximum of the signal as a function of the samples.

In the frequency domain of the Laplace transform, the physics pulse (\(\hat{P_{p}}\)) is related to the ionization current (\(\hat{I_{p}}\)) by:

\[\hat{P_{p}}(s)=\hat{K_{p}}(s)\hat{I_{p}}(s) \tag{1}\]

where \(\hat{I_{p}}\) is the Laplace transform of the ionization current \(I_{p}(t)\) at the input of the cell capacitor (cell gap) and \(\hat{K_{p}}\) contains the information of the readout circuitry. The expression for \(\hat{I_{p}}\) corresponds to the Laplace transform of a triangular function, namely:

\[\hat{I_{p}}(s)=I_{p}^{0}(\frac{e^{-\tau_{p}s}-1}{\tau_{p}^{2}s^{2}}+\frac{1}{ \tau_{p}s})\]

where \(\tau_{p}\) is the drift time and \(I_{p}^{0}\) the amplitude of the ionization current.

A similar expression holds for the calibration pulse \(P_{c}\) response to an injected calibration current \(I_{c}\). In the frequency domain of the Laplace transform this relation can be written as:

\[\hat{P_{c}}(s)=\hat{K_{c}}(s)\hat{I_{c}}(s) \tag{2}\]

where \(\hat{I_{c}}\) is the Laplace transform of \(I_{c}\) and \(\hat{K_{c}}\) contains the information of the readout circuitry. In the most simple model of the Calibration Board, the expression for \(I_{c}(t)\) is:

\[I_{c}(t)=I_{c}^{0}Y(t)(f+(1-f)e^{-t/\tau_{c}})\]

where \(I_{c}^{0}\) the amplitude of the injected current, \(Y\) is the Heaviside step function, \(\tau_{c}\) is the decay time and the fraction \(f\) can be determined as \(f=2r_{0}/(R_{0}+2r_{0})\) (see reference [7]). The resistances \(r_{0}\) and \(R_{0}\) of the Calibration Board are shown in figure 2.

The Laplace transform of the previous function is:

\[\hat{I_{c}}(s)=I_{c}^{0}(\frac{\tau_{c}(1-f)}{1+\tau_{c}s}+\frac{f}{s})\]

Although the readout circuit is the same for the calibration and physics signals, the functions \(\hat{K}_{c}\) and \(\hat{K}_{p}\) differ. This difference is due to the fact that the injection of the calibration current occurs outside the detector and sees a slightly different \(LC\)-circuit for the detector cell than the ionization current which occurs inside the detector gaps. Let us factorize \(\hat{K}_{c}\) and \(\hat{K}_{p}\) as a term corresponding to the cell \(LC\)-circuit (\(\hat{H}_{c}\) for calibration and \(\hat{H}_{p}\) for physics) and a common part associated to the readout circuit (\(\hat{A}\)). Then:

\[\hat{K}_{p}(s) =\hat{H}_{p}(s)\hat{A}(s)\] \[\hat{K}_{c}(s) =\hat{H}_{c}(s)\hat{A}(s)\]

It can be shown that:

\[\frac{\hat{H}_{p}(s)}{\hat{H}_{c}(s)}=\frac{\omega^{2}}{s^{2}+\omega^{2}}\]

where \(\omega^{2}=1/LC\), \(L\) being the inductance and \(C\) the capacitance of the calorimeter cell.

Dividing (1) and (2) the common part \(\hat{A}(s)\) cancels out obtaining the following relation between the physics and the calibration pulses:

\[\hat{P}_{p}(s)=\hat{B}(s)\hat{P}_{c}(s) \tag{3}\]

where:

\[\hat{B}(s)=\frac{\omega^{2}}{s^{2}+\omega^{2}}\frac{\hat{I}_{p}(s)}{\hat{I}_ {c}(s)}\]

In the LAPP method, the function \(\hat{B}(s)\) is discretized in the frequency domain of the Fourier transform and afterwards the physics pulse \(P_{p}(t)\) in the time domain is obtained by applying the inverse Fourier transform using a Fast Fourier Transform numerical algorithm.

The predicted physics pulse \(P_{p}(t)\) by this method is compared with the measured physics pulse \(D(t)\) at the beam test. The fit of \(P_{p}(t)\) to \(D(t)\) allows to determine the free parameter \(\omega^{2}=1/LC\) for the particular cell. Existing \(LC\) measurements should avoid this fit to \(D(t)\) as will be discussed in last section "Dependence on the quality of signal reconstruction", hence the method becomes applicable to no beam tested modules. This procedure is repeated for every cell of the calorimeter to obtain one predicted physics pulse \(P_{p}(t)\) per cell (and the corresponding \(\omega^{2}=1/LC\) in case of a fit). An idea of the quality of the prediction for \(P_{p}(t)\) can be seen in figure 3 for the response of a particular middle cell. We define the residual as (prediction - data)/prediction for each 1 ns bin of the previous histogram. The maximum of this residual (\(r_{max}\)) in absolute value is below 1% for all middle cells 8

Footnote 8: Some “sparks” are observed every 25 ns due to an imperfection in the delay clock, that can be corrected [8]

From the predicted \(P_{p}\) and its derivative, optimal filtering coefficients (\(a_{i}\)) are obtained [4] for each calorimeter cell following the procedure described in reference [9]. For any event, the maximum of the Physics Pluse (\(Q\)) is reconstructed by:

\[Q=\sum_{i=1}^{5}a_{i}S_{i}\]

where \(Q_{i}\) are the 5 samples measured.

Optimal Filtering coefficients for ECC0, ECC1 and ECC5 has been obtained, and recorded for general use, applying this method [4]. These coefficients are used for the present analysis.

## 6 Calibration of electronics

The maximum of the signal \(Q\) for each cell is converted from ADC to DAC units by applying the ramp procedure. Ramp runs were taken every day during the test beam period. The response of a cell (\(Q_{c}\)) to an injected current genereated in the calibration board is obtained for several DAC values. A second order polynomial is used to fit \(Q_{c}\) versus DAC value, which gives the relation between ADC and DAC units for the response of the particular cell. The cell response amplitude \(Q_{c}\) is reconstructed using the pulse shape extracted from delay runs [10]. During the test of ECC5 there was a resistive crosstalk introduced by parts of the Front End Crates, which spoiled the calorimeter response in some regions. This has been cured by applying special ramps that takes into account this crosstalk [11].

The following formula gives the conversion from DAC units to Amperes [7]:

\[\frac{V_{0}}{(2^{17}-1)R_{inj}}\]

where \(V_{0}=5V\) and \(R_{inj}\) is the injection resistance (see figure 2).

The conversion factor from Amperes to GeV is computed using a combination of Monte Carlo simulation and test beam data of Module 0.

## 7 Cluster Energy

In order to reconstruct the beam energy, a cluster of cells is defined around the cell with maximum energy deposit. The size of this cluster in \(\eta,\phi\) cell units is 5 x 5 for the middle and 3 x 5 for the back sampling layers. Since the segmentation of the front sampling layer depends on \(\eta\), the size of the cluster for this layer depends on \(\eta\) as well (see table 2). For the Front sampling, 1 or 2 cells in \(\phi\) are considered in the cluster depending on the beam point of incidence: if the beam is incident at the cell center \(\pm 1/4\) times the cell size, only 1 cell is considered, otherwise a neighbour cell is added to the cluster. This cluster size guarantees a negligible lateral energy leakage of the electromagnetic cascade when the electron is incident on the center of the cluster.

Figure 3: _Comparison between predicted and measured physics pulses for 120 GeV electrons at the ECC1 beam test._The electron energy is reconstructed from this cluster by adding the energies deposited in the three calorimeter sections, Front, Middle and Back, weighted with their electronic gain multiplicative factors, \(1/2,1,1\) respectively, corresponding to the channel impedance. No extra factors are introduce to reduce the effects of longitudinal leakage (negligible at 120 GeV) and dead material in front (mainly from the cryostat wall).

From a gaussian fit to the energy distribution (with typically 3000 events after cuts out of 10000) the mean energy and the energy resolution is obtained. Figure 4 shows an example for the beam incident at \(\eta=20,\phi=11\). The fit starts at -1.5 \(\sigma\) off the mean value, to reduce the effect of the dead material and residual pion contamination on the mean energy.

## 8 Analysis region

To avoid border effects, cells in the regions \(\phi=0\) and \(\phi=31\) in middle cell units are excluded for the cluster. The first of the three electrodes components of \(\phi=0\) is not present because is the junction electrode between two modules. In addition, the LAR thickness corresponding to \(\phi=31\) is far from the nominal value due to the lack of weight from the neighboring module. This effect can be seen in the capacitance measurements (see figure 7, lower curve) where the value for \(\phi=31\) suffers a large decrease that implies a big increase in the LAR gap thickness.

In addition the following regions have not been considered to build the cluster: \(\eta=0,1,2\) and

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|} \hline \(\eta\) region & \(1.4<\eta<1.8\) & \(1.8<\eta<2.0\) & \(2.0<\eta<2.4\) & \(2.4<\eta<2.5\) \\ \hline Front & 23 x (1 or 2) & 15 x (1 or 2) & 11 x (1 or 2) & 3 x (1 or 2) \\ \hline Middle & 5 x 5 & 5 x 5 & 5 x 5 & 5 x 5 \\ \hline Back & 3 x 5 & 3 x 5 & 3 x 5 & 3 x 5 \\ \hline \end{tabular}

Figure 4: _Distribution of the signal after all corrections and cuts have been applied. The gaussian fit is also shown._

\(\eta=42,43\) in middle cell units. Also dead or very noisy cells are excluded for the analysis. Table 3 shows the final number of central cells of the cluster considered. These cells are also marked in figure 1.

## 9 HV correction

The relation between the signal (\(E\)) and the High Voltage (\(U\)) applied on the gaps is [12]:

\[E\sim\frac{f_{s}}{g^{1+b}}U^{b} \tag{4}\]

where \(g\) is the liquid argon gap thickness and \(f_{s}\) the sampling fraction (which is a function of the gap thickness). The value for the exponent \(b\) was measured at Module 0 beam test to be close to 0.4 [2, 3].

The argon gap of the EMEC decreases almost linearly when the pseudorapidity (\(\eta\)) increases. This makes the cluster signal to grow along the pseudorapidity direction due to the explicit gap variation and the implicit change in the samplig fraction according to equation 4. This growth may be compensated by decreasing \(U\) continously when \(\eta\) increases. For practical reasons a decreasing stepwise function for \(U\) is chosen defining seven HV sectors for the outer wheel 9. Inside one sector the HV is constant and therefore the cluster signal increases with \(\eta\) (see left side plot of Figure 5). The first HV region (region F from \(\eta=1.375\) to \(\eta=1.5\)) is not plotted since it is not considered in this analysis.

Footnote 9: Two sectors for the inner wheel

To correct for the increase of the cluster signal inside HV sectors, \(\eta\)-dependent weights (\(w^{(s)}\)) are applied on each cell:

\[w^{(s)}(\eta_{j})=\beta^{(s)}/(1+\alpha^{(s)}(\eta_{j}-\eta^{(s)}))\]

where for a given sampling layer (front, middle or back) \(\eta_{j}\) is the cell pseudorapidity and \(\eta^{(s)}\) the pseudorapidity at the centre of the HV sector \(s\). The parameter \(\alpha^{(s)}\) is the slope of the energy dependence and the parameter \(\beta^{(s)}\) accounts for inaccurate high voltage settings, which can also be observed in the left side plot of figure 5. Both parameters are obtained from a fit to the test beam data. In principle a linear fit in each region (\(s\)) independently may be used to obtain the slope \(\alpha^{(s)}\). However two difficulties arises using that procedure: 1) the cluster near the boundary of a region contains cells of two regions and therefore the energy of such cluster is biased by the different HV settings; 2) some regions contain too few points making it difficult to obtain the slope \(\alpha^{(s)}\) with accuracy.

To overcome these difficulties a global fit to all regions is performed using a power low function as predicted by equation 4 (see right side plot of Figure 5). The response in each region is displaced by an amount obtained from the fit. This procedure smoothes the dependence of the energy versus \(\eta\). The fit curve is made linear in each region to obtain the slope \(\alpha^{(s)}\). The procedure can be iterated to obtain a more accurate result, however only two iterations are enough to reach convergence.

The resulting \(\alpha^{(s)}\) parameter is close to 0.5 for all regions, that results from the quadratic sum of two contributions, the power \(b\) and the dependence of the sampling fraction \(f_{s}\) with the gap size [4].

To give an idea of the variation of these parameters when \(\phi\) changes, figure 6 shows \(\alpha^{(s)}\) and \(\beta\) as a function of \(\phi\) and the module for the HV region B3 (\(\eta=16-23\) in middle cell units). Both parameters

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|r|r|r|r|} \hline Module & ECC0 & ECC1 & ECC5 \\ \hline Scanned & 874 & 910 & 844 \\ \hline Kept & 763 & 820 & 761 \\  & (87\%) & (90\%) & (90\%) \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 3: _Number of cluster central cells kept for the uniformity analysis_are rather independent of \(\phi\) as expected. The three modules show a similar behaviour. For other HV regions the same conclusion is extracted. These facts lead to apply a "universal" HV correction independent of \(\phi\) and of the module. The average value in \(\phi\) and module of these parameters \(\alpha^{(s)}\) and \(\beta^{(s)}\) for each HV region (\(s\)) has been used finally to correct the data presented in this note.

## 10 Capacitance correction

A non-uniformity along the \(\phi\) direction is observed in the 3 modules tested (see figure 7, upper points), specially in ECC0 and ECC1. The same kind of non-uniformity is also observed in the capacitance (\(C\)) of the middle cells, measured in the stacking frame (see figure 7, lower points).

Two effects are seen in the capacitance measurements: a global decrease (global slope) and cell-to-cell fluctuations. The global slope is not present when the modules are integrated in the wheel in vertical position (see figure 8). This slope is understood as produced by the stacking frame keeping the module under some mechanical constraints which are not present in the final wheel [13, 14]. Therefore the effect is of no concern for ATLAS. In contrast, the cell-to-cell fluctuation are also observed when the modules are integrated in the wheel. The right side plot of figure 8 shows that the fluctuations remain at the same positions irrespective of whether the module is at the stacking frame or in the ECC wheel. The plot refers to module ECC0.

The good correlation of the waving (fluctuating) behaviour between the measured signal and the capacitance (see figure 7) leads to interpret this asymmetry in the calorimeter response as a consequence of fluctuations of the gap thickness around the nominal value. The fluctuations in the capacitance are of the order 1%, which means for a 1 mm (3 mm) gap thickness 10 microns (30 microns). Such fluctuations in the gap thickness can be generated during the module stacking.

On the other hand, it has been shown for the ECA wheel that the fluctuations of the capacitance measured at the stacking frame are in good agreement with the ones measured on the integrated wheel [14]. Therefore it is possible to use the measurements in the stacking frame to correct the data for these gap-to-gap fluctuations. Unfortunately there is lack of such measurements for some of the ECC modules, in particular for module ECC1.

There exist however capacitance measurements performed at the ECC wheel, but they correspond

Figure 5: _Cluster energy versus \(\eta\). A correction is needed inside each high voltage sector_.

Figure 7: _Upper points: Cluster signal versus \(\phi\) for a fixed value of \(\eta=1.8875\) in module ECC0. Lower graph: Capacitance versus \(\phi\) measured in the stacking frame for each middle cell of ECC0 at \(\eta=1.8875\). The units of the capacitance are arbitrary. A good correlation between the non-uniformities seen in the signal and the capacitance is observed._

to only one \(\eta\) value (\(\eta=39\)). Unfortunately these measurements were done during fixes of bad behaved channels simultaneously, that is people touching, plug-in and unplug-in MB and SB, soldering, etc. These operations affected the ground of the capacitance used for the measurements, hence its reference line. For instance, the step seen in the left side plot of figure 8 at \(\phi=24\) is interpreted as a change of the ground during the measurements of ECC1. In addition, a low quality probe was used, which made the measurements to experience larger fluctuations, as can been seen comparing the measurements for ECC0 on the wheel and in the stacking frame (right side plot of figure 8).

A summary of the kind of C-measurements performed for the three beam-tested modules, ECC0, ECC1 and ECC5, is given in table 4.

The corrected cluster energy is obtained from the raw energy according to the following relation:

\[E^{cell}_{cor}=E^{cell}/(\frac{C^{cell}}{<C^{cell}>})^{\alpha^{(s)}} \tag{5}\]

where \(<C^{cell}>\) is the cell capacitance averaged over all \(\phi\). This correction is only applied to the signal of middle cells, since there are C-measurements for this sampling only. On the other hand, there is evidence that the front cells keep the nominal gap thickness in the stacking frame ([15]). Moreover, the

middle sampling contributes with about 79% of the cluster energy, hence fluctuations in the middle cell energies dominates. The power \(\alpha^{\langle s\rangle}\) corresponds to the slope of the HV correction, since the dependence of the energy with the gap thickness must be similar in the \(\eta\) and \(\phi\) directions ([4]).

Relation 5 corrects both the waving behaviour and the slope.

## 11 Lateral leakage correction

The cluster size is large enough to contain the shower energy when the beam is incident right on the center of the cluster. However, for each run, the beam was tuned in such a way the point of incidence is uniformly distributed along a size larger than one middle cell in both directions \(\eta\) and \(\phi\). Figure 9 shows the reconstructed cluster energy as a function of the point of incidence of the beam along the \(\eta\) direction. The cluster central cell is \(\eta_{c}=1.7625\) (cell 14 of the middle sampling). The point of incidence of the beam is obtained using the Front sampling as the following linear barycenter:

\[\eta_{bar}=\frac{\sum_{i}E_{i}\eta_{i}}{\sum_{i}E_{i}}\]

where \(\eta_{i}\) is the position of cell \(i\) and \(E_{i}\) the energy deposited in cell \(i\). The index \(i\) runs on all cluster cells of the Front sampling.

For events of the run where the electron is incident far from the the center of the cluster, an observable lateral leakage is produced (see figure 9). A parabolic fit \(1+K(\eta-\eta_{c})^{2}\), \(\eta_{c}\) being the centre of the cluster, describes well this \(\eta\) dependence of the cluster energy. Hence, the correction for this lateral leakage is obtained as follows:

\[E_{cor}=E/(1+K(\eta-\eta_{c})^{2})\]

The parameter \(K\) in absolute value increases with \(\eta_{c}\), which indicates a decrease of the shower containment for larger \(\eta_{c}\) values. This dependence has been parametrised by a straight line \(K=p_{0}+p_{1}\eta\), being \(p_{0}=81.5\) and \(p_{1}=-60.7\) as obtained in reference [4].

The cluster chosen, 5 by 5 middle cells, is larger along the \(\phi\) direction than along the \(\eta\) direction. This fact makes the leakage along \(\phi\) be negligible and therefore no correction is needed in this case.

Figure 9: _Cluster energy versus \(\eta\) incident position of the beam on cell 14 (middle cell units)._

## 12 \(\phi\)-modulation correction

The accordeon shape introduces non-uniformities of the electric field along \(\phi\) inside every gap between 2 consecutive absorbers. This translates to periodic non-uniformities on the cluster energy along the \(\phi\) direction ("\(\phi\)-modulation"), where the period is the distance between two consecutive absorbers. Figure 10 shows the cluster energy as a function of the barycentre in \(\phi\) for two \(\eta\) positions. The barycentre in \(\phi\) is obtained using the middle cells of the cluster in units of the thickness between 2 consecutive absorbers. The amplitude of the modulation decreases with the amplitude of the waves of the accordion geometry, that is when \(\eta\) increases (see figure 10).

The \(\phi\)-modulation is corrected using a Fourier polynomial in the following manner [16]:

\[E_{cor}=E/[a_{0}(1+\sum_{k=1}^{3}a_{k}cos(2\pi k(\phi-\phi_{0}))+b_{1}sin(2\pi (\phi-\phi_{0})))]\]

where \(a_{1},a_{2},a_{3},b_{1}\) are \(\eta\) dependent.

The \(\eta\) dependence of the first two parameters \(a_{1}\) and \(a_{2}\) is represented in figure 11 for the three modules. A good agreement between modules is observed that leads to obtain a universal correction. A similar conclusion is extracted for the rest of parameters. Hence, the \(\eta\) dependences of the parameters \(a_{1},a_{2},a_{3},b_{1},\phi_{0}\) are parametrised by 5 polinomials obtained from the best fit to the data of the three modules ECC0, ECC1 and ECC5.

## 13 Uniformity

The distribution of the mean cluster energy reconstructed at every scan point is represented as a histogram for each module in figure 12. There is an entry per cell of the region of analysis. The \(\phi\)-asymmetry has been corrected using the capacitance measured at the stacking frame for ECC0 and the test beam data itself (average response) for ECC1. For ECC5 only the global slope is corrected using the Test Beam data since the gap to gap fluctuations are found to be small. We observe a gaussian distribution with (\(\sigma\)/mean) less than 0.6 % for each of the modules.

Figure 10: \(\phi\)_-modulation. Cluster energy versus \(\phi\) for \(\eta=1.56\,25\) (left) and \(\eta=2.2125\) (right). The quantity \(\phi\) is in units of the thickness between 2 consecutive absorbers._Figure 11: _Coefficients \(a_{1}\) and \(a_{2}\) of the \(\phi\)-modulation versus \(\eta\) for the three modules. Good agreement is observed between modules._

Figure 12: _Distribution of the mean cluster energy for ECC0, ECC1 and ECC5._

Table 5 summarizes the results for the non-uniformity (\(\sigma/<E>\)). The numbers are in good agreement with an independent analysis done at CPPM [4] except for module ECC 5 (\(\sigma/<E>=0.57\%\) for the CPPM analysis). We understand that the reason for this discrepancy comes from the procedure to correct the gap to gap fluctuations: CPPM uses the capagap measurements and we use the test beam data (average response) for this module.

The non-uniformities along the \(\eta\) and \(\phi\) directions are given as well. These are obtained as follows. For a given \(\eta\) scan (\(\phi\) is kept constant at \(\phi_{k}\)) the quantity

\[\Delta E_{i}^{(\phi_{k})}=(E_{i}^{(\phi_{k})}-E^{(\phi_{k})})/E^{(\phi_{k})} \quad i=1,\ldots,n_{\phi}\]

is determined, where \(n_{\phi}\) is the number of points of the scan and \(E^{(\phi_{k})}=\frac{1}{n_{\phi}}\sum_{i=1}^{n_{\phi}}E_{i}^{(\phi_{k})}\). This process is repeated for all \(\eta\) scans (for all \(\phi\) values) and the quantities \(\Delta E_{i}^{(\phi_{k})}\) are histogramed. If \(n_{\eta}\) is the number of \(\eta\) scans, the number of entries on this histogram is \(n_{\eta}\times n_{\phi}\). From a gaussian fit to this distribution the non-uniformity along the \(\eta\) direction, \(\sigma_{\eta}/<E>\), is obtained. A similar procedure is followed to obtain \(\sigma_{\phi}/<E>\) from the \(\phi\) scans. We observe small differences in the non-uniformity along these orthogonal directions \(\eta\) and \(\phi\) (see table 5), which indicates a slight anisotropic performance of the module. We consider the following two sources of anisotropy:

1. Along the \(\eta\)-direction we know that the regions near the cracks, at low and high \(\eta\) values, have a worse non-uniformity, which spoils the value of \(\sigma_{\eta}\).
2. Along the \(\phi\)-direction the gap to gap fluctuations, smaller for ECC5, and the procedure to correct them influences the final result on \(\sigma_{\phi}\)

We study then by obtaining the non-uniformity in the \(\eta\)-region from 8 to 35 (middle cell units), far away from the cracks, and by correcting the gap to gap fluctuations using the average response of the test beam data, module by module for the three modules. The results are shown in table 6. A very good agreement between \(\sigma_{\eta}\) and \(\sigma_{\phi}\) is observed for the three modules. On the other hand, there remains a residual effect as indicated by the fact that \(\sigma\) is larger than \(\sigma_{\eta}\) (or \(\sigma_{\phi}\)). The value is however very small and does not disturb the performance goal.

Finally, we show in table 7 the non-uniformity obtained when the capacitance correction is performed by using the C-measurements on the ECC wheel at \(\eta=39\) (middle cell units). The result is similar as the nominal for ECC0, obtained when the capacitance correction is done by using the C-measurements at the stacking frame. For a module like ECC1, where no C-measurements at stacking frame are available, the result is still at the limit of tolerance (0.6%).

## 14 Dependence on the quality of signal reconstruction

In the previous analysis the lapp method for the signal reconstruction has been used. It provides a description of the pulse shape at a level of better than 1%. Is this level of description enough for the uniformity studies? What level can we tollerate in order to leave the uniformity unaffected? To answer these questions we have developed three methods to reconstruct the signal of ECC1 cells with different levels of description. In what follows we will refer to these methods as M, Mref and Mref2w. The residuals for these methods will be at the level of \(\pm 4\%\), \(\pm 1.3\%\) and \(\pm 0.8\%\) respectively. The procedure to cancel out the common part of the readout circuit in the Laplace frequency space is the same for these methods as for LAPP, already described in section 5 (see equation 3). The difference however concerns the way to pass from the frequency space to the time domain.

For these three methods (M, Mref and Mref2w), the numerical approach to obtain the predicted physics pulse \(P_{p}(t)\) from the calibration pulse \(P_{c}(t)\) is different from the approach used in the LAPP algorithm Basically the numerical integration is done in the time domain of the the exact inverse Laplace transform, in contrast to the LAPP method that discretizes in the frequency domain and makes a numerical inverse Fourier transform 10

Footnote 10: The fact that methods M, Mref and Mref2w discretize in the time domain means that no regularization of divergences needs to be applied in contrast to the LAPP method that discretizes in the frequency domain.

Method M is the simplest version. The first one who used this idea was L. Kurchaninov to analyse the test beam data of the HEC calorimeter modules [17]. An analytic inversion of the Laplace transform is applied to \(\hat{B}(s)\) in order to obtain \(B(t)\) in the time domain. Afterwards, the function \(P_{p}(t)\) is predicted by solving numerically the following integral:

\[P_{p}(t)=\int_{0}^{t}B(t-t^{\prime})P_{c}(t^{\prime})dt^{\prime}\]

where \(P_{c}(t^{\prime})\) is the measured calibration pulse obtained from delay runs.

The predicted physics pulse \(P_{p}(t)\) is compared with the measured physics pulse, \(D(t)\), corresponding to 120 GeV electrons of the ECC1 beam test. The fit of \(P_{p}\) to \(D\) allows to determine \(\omega^{2}=1/LC\) for the particular calorimeter cell. This procedure is repeated for every cell of the calorimeter. The values of \(LC\) obtained from the fit of \(P_{p}\) to \(D(t)\) are close to measurements performed using a network analyser (see figure 15).

The parameters \(\tau_{c}\), \(f\) and \(\tau_{p}\), that appear in the function \(B(t)\) (see section 5), were considered fixed for the fit. The values for \(\tau_{c}\) and \(f\) are the same used for the EMBarrel modules which were obtained from the 32 samples data in the H8 test beam period [18]. One should not expect great differences since the calibration board was the same for EMBarrel and EMEC tests. The value of the drift time \(\tau_{p}\) was obtained from measurements on the calorimeter prototype Module 0. The values of \(\tau_{p}\) depend on \(\eta\) because of the cell size and gap variation with \(\eta\) of the EMEC modules. Typical values range from 600 ns at low \(\eta\) to 300 ns at high \(\eta\) for middle cells.

The quality of the prediction for \(P_{p}(t)\) can be seen on the left side plot of figure 13. We define the residual \(r\) as the relative difference between the prediction and the data histograms, namely:

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|r|c|c|} \hline Module & ECC0 & ECC1 \\ \hline \(\sigma/<E>\) & (0.57\(\pm\) 0.02\%) & (0.51\(\pm\) 0.02\%) \\ \hline \(\sigma/<E>\) (C-wheel) & (0.58\(\pm\) 0.02\%) & (0.62\(\pm\) 0.02\%) \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 7: _Deviation from uniformity for ECC0 and ECC1. The \(\phi\)-asymmetry is corrected using C-stack for ECC0 and TB-data for ECC1 in the first raw and using C-wheel in the second raw._\[r^{(i)}=\frac{P_{p}^{(i)}-D^{(i)}}{P_{p}^{(i)}}\quad i=1,\ldots,nbins\]

To avoid the lack of statistics of one run, several runs of a \(\phi\)-scan are combined to obtain an average residual. This residual is shown in figure 14, where the full line corresponds to method M. The maximum value for the residual (\(r_{max}\)) is about 4.2%, which unfortunately is reached at the signal peak.

Method Mref is like method M but including reflexions in the calibration and signal lines. The predicted physics pulse shape is obtained from the following integral:

\[P_{p}(t)=\int_{0}^{t}(B(t-t^{\prime})+K_{r}B(t-t^{\prime}-t_{r}))P_{c}(t^{ \prime})dt^{\prime}\]

Two additional parameters are introduced, the amplitude of the reflexion \(K_{r}\) and its delay \(t_{r}\). Notice that method Mref become method M if \(K_{r}=0\). The three parameters \(\omega,\ K_{r}\) and \(t_{r}\) are obtained from a fit to the measured pulse \(D(t)\). Values of \(K_{r}\) and \(t_{r}\) obtained from this fit for a typical middle cell are 0.09 and 20 ns respectively. These reasonable values lead to think there can be reflexions on the readout line for the data.

Right side plot of figure 15 shows a comparison between the \(\omega\) obtained from this fit and measurements performed on the ECC wheel using a network analyser device. The values of \(\omega\) correspond to middle cells of a \(\eta\)-scan. There is a good agreement for all cells what confirms the modelling of the circuit in the Mref method. Therefore we can use the values of the \(LC\) measurements in the method instead of fitting the test beam data. This is important to predict the physics shape \(P_{p}\) for modules that did not pass through a beam test. We also notice that the agreement is worse using method M without reflexions (see left side plot of figure 15).

The quality of the prediction for \(P_{p}(t)\) can be seen on the middle plot of figure 13 and the residual (dashed line of figure 14). The maximum residual (\(r_{max}\)) is 1.3% for middle cells of the ECC1 module.

Method Mref2w is like method Mref but adding a parasitic \(LC\) in the readout circuit. This is considered by adding a second frequency to the function \(\hat{B}(s)\), that is adding the following function:

Figure 14: _Residuals \(r^{(i)}\) of middle cells for the three signal reconstruction methods \(M\) (full line), Mref (dashed line) and Mref2w (dotted line)._

\[\hat{B}^{\prime}(s)=K^{\prime}\frac{\omega^{{}^{\prime}2}}{s^{2}+\omega^{{}^{ \prime}2}}\frac{I_{p}(s)}{I_{c}(s)}\]

The predicted physics pulse includes the reflexion as well:

\[P_{p}(t)=\int_{0}^{t}(B(t-t^{\prime})+K_{r}B(t-t^{\prime}-t_{r})+\hat{B}^{ \prime}(t-t^{\prime}))P_{e}(t^{\prime})dt^{\prime}\]

Notice that method Mref2w become method Mref if \(K^{\prime}=0\). The parameters \(\omega,\ w^{\prime},\ K^{\prime},\ K_{r}\) and \(t_{r}\) are obtained from a fit to the measured pulse \(D(t)\). Typical values for \(K^{\prime}\) and \(w^{\prime}\) are 0.08 and 0.6 \(\times\)\(\omega\) respectively for middle cells, while \(\omega\), \(K_{r}\) and \(t_{r}\) keep similar values as method method Mref, namely 0.2, 0.05, 30 ns respectively. The quality of the prediction for \(P_{p}(t)\) can be seen on the right side plot of figure 13 and the dotted line of figure 14 for the residuals. The maximum residual (\(r_{max}\)) is at the level of 0.8%.

Related to the description of the pulse shape is the dependence of the cluster energy on the arrival of the beam particle or TDC trigger time. We will refer to it as TDC dependence of the cluster energy. In Figure 16 the cluster energy is represented as a function of this TDC time for one middle cell and the two signal reconstruction methods M (left side plot) and Mref2w (right side plot). The cluster energy has an observable time dependence for method M, while this dependence is negligible for method Mref2w. Therefore, the TDC dependence of the cluster energy decreases with the residual \(r_{max}\).

The TDC dependence can be parametrized by a second degree polinomial. The curvature \(C_{t}\) of this polinomial is given as a function of the signal reconstruction method in table 8. The curvature \(C_{t}\) decreases with the residual \(r_{max}\). For the sake of comparison, the curvature for the parabola method is also shown in table 8. In contrast to the OF-based methods, the residual \(r_{max}\) for the parabola method cannot be obtained in the whole range of 125 ns, but only in 75 ns around the maximum of the signal, since it uses the 3 samples of highest amplitude to fit a parabola. We observed that \(C_{t}\) is slightly smaller for LAPP than for Mref2w. This may be explained by the fact that the \(r^{(i)}\) around the peak of the pulse is smaller for LAPP than for Mref2w. The residual around the peak contributes more to \(C_{t}\).

Figure 16: Cluster energy as a function of the TDC time using signal reconstruction method M (left) and method Mref2w (right).

Table 9 shows the ECC1 non-uniformity for the different signal reconstruction methods. It is observed that the four methods give similar results irrespective of the residual, keeping \(r_{max}\leq 4.2\%\). This means that we could even use method M to obtain the non-uniformity of the modules. Similar conclusion is infered for the non-uniformities \(\sigma_{\eta}\) and \(\sigma_{\phi}\).

## 15 Conclusions

An analysis of the test beam data on the uniformity of three ECC modules is presented. The modules are denoted as ECC0, ECC1 and ECC5. Results for outer wheel only are quoted.

A cell to cell non-uniformity below 0.6% is found for the three modules, which is in accordance with the goal stated in the Technical Design Report.

The results are in good agreement with an independent analysis done at CPPM [4].

A slight anisotropy on the non-uniformity along the two orthogonal directions \(\eta\) and \(\phi\) is observed, that is due to the crack regions a low and high \(\eta\) and the quality of the capacitance correction.

The results are found to be independent of the signal reconstruction method used as long as the residuals are kept below 4%.
