**Abstract**

In the summer 1998 we have exposed to the Cern H8 test beam the BIL prototype _Calypso_ filled with an Ar (93%) CO\({}_{2}\) (7%) gas mixture, which is the current baseline for the Atlas MDT chambers. A possible problem of this gas mixture is the important variation of the drift velocity along the drift path. The aim of the test was to assess the possibility of operating the chamber and measuring the r-t relation in such conditions. Moreover we checked the performance of the chamber with a large-area (\(50\times 50\) cm\({}^{2}\)) beam using a hodoscope trigger and two precision trackers.

Introduction

After several studies concerning the aging behaviour of different gas mixtures, the ATLAS Collaboration decided to use as baseline Ar-CO\({}_{2}\) based gas mixtures. Even though those mixtures seem to be less prone to aging effects, they have some disadvantages, as for example the non-linearity of the r-t relation and the large maximum drift time, compared with the mixtures containing hydrocarbons. Moreover the lack of a quencher makes those mixtures less stable and more subject to streamers and noise. The main aim of this test was to study the possibility of operating safely the chambers at the nominal gain of 2\(\times 10^{4}\), to check the autocalibration procedure previously developed ([1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6]) with a non-linear gas and to measure the resolution for this mixture.

In addition we studied for the first time the Calypso chamber over a large area, using two external precision trackers and a large area hodoscope as the trigger. Using these data we checked both the mechanical quality of the chamber and the uniformity of the r-t relation.

In section 2 we review the experimental setup and the other detectors which are necessary to analyse the data. We also describe the data samples. In section 3 we discuss the operating conditions of Calypso. Section 4 is devoted to the calibration of the Ar-CO\({}_{2}\) mixture with the small area trigger sample. In section 5 we show the single tube resolution and in section 6 the efficiency. Section 7 is dedicated to the results from the large area trigger sample, especially the calibration and the comparison with the tracks measured in the tracker detectors. Finally, in section 8 we draw some conclusions.

## 2 Experimental setup

The test was performed in the H8 beam test area at the CERN SPS, using 180 GeV/c muons1. The beam r.m.s. dimensions at the Calypso position were about 6 cm and the beam angular spread was \(\sim 1\) mrad.

Footnote 1: We have also data, not discussed in this note, with lower energy muons.

Two MDT prototypes were present : the BIL chamber Calypso, which is discussed in the following, and a BOS prototype, described in ref. [7].

We used alternatively two trigger hodoscopes. The small-area one is given by the coincidence of the signals of two scintillators (10\(\times\)10 cm\({}^{2}\) and 10\(\times\)15 cm\({}^{2}\)) centered on the beam line. The large-area one (60\(\times\)100 cm\({}^{2}\)) consists in the coincidence of the signals coming from two planes of six scintillating slabs (10\(\times\)100 cm\({}^{2}\) each).

In fig.1 we schematically show the experimental setup and define the reference system. The x-axis is taken as the direction of the muon beam. The y-axis, which is also measured by the MDT chambers, is horizontal. The z-axis is vertical, along the direction of the wires of the MDT prototypes. All the detectors based on drift tubes can be rotated in the xy plane, in such a way that the angle between the beam direction and the line normal to the chamber (called \(\phi\) in the following) varies up to \(\sim 20^{\circ}\).

In the beam line there were two precision trackers, described in ref. [8], at a distance from the Calypso chamber of \(\sim 2\) m and \(\sim 7\) m respectively. Each of them is made by two three-layers of drift tubes. The tubes are identical to those used for Calypso, with a length of about 80 cm. The two three-layers are placed at 90\({}^{\circ}\) each other, on an aluminum precision frame. In such a way one three-layer measures the y-coordinate, as the Calypso chamber, while the other measures the z-coordinate, along the Calypso wires. The tubes were operated in streamer 

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:4]

mode with a Ar (40%) Isobutane (60%) gas mixture at 1 bar absolute pressure and at an operating voltage of \(\sim 5200\) V. With these detectors we were able to track the beam particles at the position of the MDT prototypes with an accuracy of 50 \(\mu\)m, including both the tracker resolution and the contribution of the multiple scattering.

The data discussed in this note, shown in table 1, are divided in two main groups : (a) small-area triggers (two angular scans, at 10 days distance), which allow an easier calibration, plus studies of resolution and efficiency, and (b) large-area triggers (an angular scan and some large statistics at fixed value of \(\phi\)), for studies of the systematics of the chamber construction and drift properties.

We have also some data with the same gas mixture used in the previous years, i.e. the so-called _Datcha gas_ : Ar (91%) N\({}_{2}\) (4%) CH\({}_{4}\) (5%). These data are used as a reference, for a better understanding of the chamber performances as a function of the gas mixture. We have analyzed them following the method discussed in ref. [4].

In addition, we have some other angular scans at a different high voltage setting and at different thresholds, to check the dependence of the r-t relation from those parameters. These data will be discussed in a forthcoming note.

## 3 Operating conditions

The Calypso chamber has been already described in detail in [2], [4], [6]. It is a BIL chamber with 192 tubes, organized in two multilayers of three staggered layers of 32 tubes each. The tubes are filled with a Ar (93%) CO\({}_{2}\) (7%) gas mixture, at 3 bar absolute pressure. The gas flow is about 70 Nl/h, equivalent to about 2 volume changes per day. The chamber is operated in avalanche mode at a fixed gain of \(2\times 10^{4}\), corresponding to set the HV to \(\sim 3080\) V.

Each tube is read by an electronic chain composed by a charge preamplifier, a shaper with a 12 ns peaking time and a discriminator. The discriminator threshold was set to 1.41 V, which, at the gas gain of \(2\times 10^{4}\), corresponds in our electronics to the charge produced by the primary ionization of 25 electrons.

The discriminated signals were fed in a KLOE TDC [9] with a \(\sim 1\) ns LSB. The TDCs were operated in common stop mode. The stop signal was given by the trigger signal delayed by about 3 \(\mu\)s and then reshaped by a discriminator.

In fig. 2 we show a typical time spectrum for a single tube filled with the two gas mixtures. The time window, which corresponds to the passage of a particle in the tube, is well identified in both cases. The non-linearity of the r-t relation for the Ar-CO\({}_{2}\) mixture and the smaller drift velocity with respect to the Datcha gas are also evident from the distributions. From the number of hits outside the time window of the signal, we interpolate the noise in the signal region, and find a rate of strobed noise of 0.2% for Ar-CO\({}_{2}\).

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|} \hline angle \(\phi\) & step in \(\phi\) & trigger & gas & events \\ \hline \hline \(0^{\circ}-11^{\circ}\) & \(1^{\circ}\) & small area & Ar-CO\({}_{2}\) & 320,000 \\ \(1^{\circ}-11^{\circ}\) & \(1^{\circ}\) & small area & Ar-CO\({}_{2}\) & 120,000 \\ \(1^{\circ}-11^{\circ}\) & \(1^{\circ}\) & large area & Ar-CO\({}_{2}\) & 1,500,000 \\ \(5^{\circ},7^{\circ}\) & - & large area & Ar-CO\({}_{2}\) & 1,260,000 \\ \(0^{\circ}-20^{\circ}\) & \(2^{\circ}\) & small area & _Datcha_ & 200,000 \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 1: Data used in this note.

Figure 2: Time distribution of the hits for a typical tube filled with Ar-CO\({}_{2}\) (upper figure) and Datcha gas (lower figure).

The distributions shown in fig. 2 are then fitted with an appropriate function, following the method of ref. [4], in order to compute the time parameters for each tube. The offset \(t_{o}\) and the maximum time \(t_{max}\) are defined as the parameters of the Fermi-Dirac functions, which measure the lower and upper boundaries of the signal distribution. Therefore their difference \(t_{tot}~{}=~{}t_{max}~{}-~{}t_{o}\) is related to the maximum drift time, and, in presence of identical drift properties, should be the same for all the tubes. Fig. 3 shows the distribution of \(t_{tot}\) for all the tubes of Calypso filled with Ar-CO\({}_{2}\). We have only excluded few tubes with a number of signal hits too small to compute the time parameters. The average of \(t_{tot}\) is found to be 683 ns, to be compared with \(\sim 520\) ns of the Datcha gas mixture. The r.m.s. width of the distribution of fig. 3 of \(\leq 2\) ns is compatible with the error in the determination of \(t_{max}\), which is dominated by the small statistics in the tail of the distribution of fig. 2 in the Ar-CO\({}_{2}\) case.

The drift properties of the Ar-CO\({}_{2}\) mixture at constant pressure are expected to depend on the temperature. As an example, from ref. [10], we compute a variation of \(t_{tot}\) of about -2.4 ns/K for this gas mixture. We can compare this prediction with the measured values, by choosing individual runs, when the temperature in the Cern SPS North Hall is at extreme values. This measurement is affected by large errors, both statistical, due to the uncertainty in the measurement of \(t_{tot}\) with a small sample, and systematical, because we do not take into account the temperature variations due to the front-end electronics. However, the data show a qualitative agreement with the calculation (increase of the average \(t_{max}\) of \(3\div 4\) ns when the temperature decreases by \(\sim 2\) K).

The data studied in this note have been taken at an external average value of 299 K, with a r.m.s. variation of 1.3 K over more than 10 days. Smaller samples like individual runs or groups of runs show a r.m.s. fluctuation below 1 K. Using the values of the difference between the

original and the distorted drift paths, shown in ref. [10], the r.m.s. of the systematic variation \(\delta r^{r.m.s.}\) for a single tube is computed to be \(\sim 14\)\(\mu\)m/K. Therefore, we do not expect to see any measurable deviation, neither in the systematics of the calibration, nor in the chamber resolution, because the effect is either automatically included in the autocalibration, or too small to be detected.

## 4 Calibration of the small area sample

The two Calypso multilayers have been autocalibrated with the same algorithm as in the 1997 data (see [4], [6]), using the first angular scan with the small area trigger shown in table 1.

Shortly, the method consists in minimizing for each multilayer the residuals to the straight-line fits by modifying iteratively the time-to-space dependence. In this way, we obtain a final function (in the following called _r-t relation_), which is both independent from the initial approximation and valid for all the tubes. Fig. 4 shows the scatter plot of the residuals to the line fit, as a function of the drift path, for both the first and last iteration of the autocalibration algorithm. The strong systematics at the 1 mm level, which affect the starting value of the r-t relation, disappear, leaving only the spread due to the single tube resolution.

Fig. 5 shows the final r-t relation, compared with the same function for the Datcha gas. Fig. 6 shows the drift velocity, computed numerically from the distribution of fig. 5, as a function of the distance from the wire. The non-linearity of the r-t relation is quite remarkable. The measurements are compared with the results of the independent calculation [11] and found in good agreement.

Another interesting test is the speed and the reliability of the mathematical convergence of the numerical fit of the autocalibration procedure, in presence of a non-linear r-t relation (see e.g. [8]). Fig. 7 shows the r.m.s. difference between the value of the r-t relation at the i-th iteration and the final value in the interval \(4\div 12\) mm, as a function of the iteration number. Our conclusion, also derived from the overall experience with the data discussed in this note, is that, in presence of adequate statistical samples like those shown in table 1, no real problem arises in the fit. The results is also insensitive to the starting value of the r-t relation, derived from the calculation [11], or from the quick method discussed in ref. [5], or with a constant drift velocity.

The autocalibration has been checked with the measurements of the tracker detectors [8]. Using the intercept of the straight-line fits to the measurement of the trackers, it is possible to estimate the r-t relation in Calypso in an independent way. Even if the computed error of a single event is quite large (\(45\ \div\ 55\ \mu\)m), a sample of moderate statistics allows to reach an accuracy well below the goal of \(\leq 10\ \mu\)m on each space interval. Fig. 8 shows the difference between the two r-t relations, as a function of the drift path. For paths above 2 mm the r.m.s. value of the difference is 16 \(\mu\)m. Again, the agreement of the results within the tolerable systematics shows the feasibility of such operating conditions and the adequacy of the autocalibration method.

Instead, for drift paths below 2 mm the simple approach described here produces important systematic errors, up to 100 \(\mu\)m. This effect is not restricted to the Ar-CO\({}_{2}\) case, but appears also with the Datcha mixture [4]. This error is probably due to the discreteness of the ionization mechanism and to the large value of the drift velocity near the wire, which result in drift paths not orthogonal to the track and produce an apparent increase of the distance track-wire, with large fluctuations. However, while the average systematic error can be corrected by using the values of fig. 8 or an equivalent calculation, the event-by-event fluctuations generate an increase Figure 4: Signed residual as a function of the drift path, after the first iteration of the autocalibration (upper plot) and the final result (lower plot).

in the resolution, which is inherent to the drift tube method and cannot be compensated.

## 5 Resolution

The single tube resolution has been measured from the straight-line fits, using the same method described in [4]. One measurement is excluded from the line fit, then the signed distance between this measurement and the computed line is evaluated. The resolution is computed by disentangling from the r.m.s. of this distribution the error due to the fit. This value, shown in fig. 9 as a function of the drift path, is well reproduced by the independent calculation of the Garfield programme [11], which takes into account the drift properties of the mixture, the characteristics of our electronics and the operating conditions of the chamber.

As an exercise, the resolution of the single tube, shown in fig. 9, has been propagated to the case of a straight line, obtained from a fit to the three measurements of a multilayer. The space error at the center of the multilayer is plotted in fig. 10, as a function of the drift space in the central tube, for various values of the angle between the track and the normal to the chamber. Because of the dependence of the single tube resolution, as a function of the drift path, and the correlation between the three drift paths in a multilayer, also the line resolution is not a constant. Its minimum value is obtained for tracks orthogonal to the chamber, when the points on the first and third layer correspond to the best resolution. On the contrary, the worst resolution corresponds to a track angle and position such that all the three layers are encountered near the wire, where the resolution is worse.

An independent evaluation of the resolution can be derived from the distribution of \(\Delta\), defined as the signed distance between the line measured with the trackers and the position

reconstructed in Calypso after the autocalibration. Since the average of this distribution is compatible with zero, as implied by fig. 8, its width has to be the combined effect of the accuracy of the interpolation and the resolution of the MDT tubes. In ref. [8] we evaluate the former, which amounts to \(\sim 50\)\(\mu\)m, and shows no correlation with the drift path in Calypso. Fig. 11 shows the pull (i.e. the distribution of \(\Delta/\sigma[\Delta]\)), for all the drift paths and the layers of Calypso. The error \(\sigma[\Delta]\) is evaluated for each event by summing in quadrature the interpolation error and the resolution computed from ref. [11] and shown in fig. 9. The quality of the result (mean and sigma well compatible with a normal Gaussian) gives confidence in the method.

Fig. 12 shows the single tube resolution, as a function of the drift path. The data points are the widths of the gaussian fits to the distribution of \(\Delta\) for different intervals of the drift path, with the interpolation error subtracted in quadrature. The function is the result of ref. [11], and is identical to the function of fig. 9. The resolution measured in this way is clearly well compatible with the independent calculation [11] and with the result of the autocalibration method.

## 6 Efficiency

The single tube efficiency has been derived from tracks measured in the external tracker system. These tracks have been interpolated at the position of Calypso, and the expected hit has been compared with the observed signals. In almost all the cases the concerned tube exhibits at least one hit. However, the presence of \(\delta-\mathrm{rays}\) and the electronic noise in few cases inhibit the detection of the relevant signal. Therefore the efficiency is defined here as the probability to detect a hit within 5 standard deviation (\(\sigma\)) from the expected one. Both the tube resolution

and the extrapolation error contribute to the definition of \(\sigma\). Fig. 13 shows the efficiency of a typical tube. Although the sample is quite limited, we observe that the shape exhibits the expected drop at high values of the drift path, due to the presence of \(\delta-\mathrm{rays}\). The overall efficiency is comparable to the one obtained with a similar algorithm for the Datcha gas [4].

## 7 Large area results

The data taken with the small-area trigger are intrinsically simpler and cleaner than those collected with the large-area trigger. In fact, they are not affected by the (potentially important) systematic effects due to the differences in the mechanics and drifting properties between different tubes or different zones of the same tube. However, to study the MDT prototypes in realistic conditions, it is also necessary to study large-area data and compare large- and small-area performances. Therefore, in this section we discuss the data collected with the large-area trigger.

Fig. 14 shows the scatter plot of the time measured in the tubes of the first layer of multilayer 1, as a function of the y-coordinate interpolated from the line computed from the trackers. As clearly evident from the plot, many nearby tubes have been used. The figure shows in a qualitative way the correct expected behaviour. The lack of data for some interval in the chamber is due to inefficiencies in some tracker tubes, and not to Calypso.

Because of the different trigger, the large- and small-area data differ by an overall time offset, which has to be determined from the data themselves. Moreover the large area data have to be corrected [4] for the time of the signal propagation along the wire. This correction is derived with the help of the detectors which measure the z-coordinate. However, once these differences have been properly accounted for, the r-t relations computed from small- and large-area data should be equal within the statistic and systematic errors.

The first check of the large-area data is the study of the similarity of the drift properties of all the tubes. We notice that, as discussed in section 3, the width of the distribution of the maximum drift time for all the tubes (\(\leq 2\) ns, see fig. 3) is compatible with the statistical accuracy of the determination of \(t_{tot}\). It therefore shows the similarity of the drift properties of the tubes at the ns level, which is a basic property for the autocalibration method.

Figure 14: Scatter plot of the the time, measured from the Calypso TDC versus the space position, measured from the trackers.

After these checks and corrections have been computed, the autocalibration technique discussed above has been applied to the large-area data separately. Fig. 15 shows the differences of the r-t relations of the small- and large-area samples, as a function of the drift path. In this case, the r.m.s. difference between the two r-t relation for paths between 1 mm and 14 mm is 13 \(\mu\)m. Again, the systematics is within the tolerable level, as a further check of the compatibility both in the mechanics of the tubes and in the drift properties of the gas.

## 8 Conclusions

In summer 1998 the BIL prototype Calypso has been filled with a Ar-CO\({}_{2}\) gas mixture and exposed to a muon beam of 180 GeV/c. Both small- and large-area triggers have been collected.

The former data sample shows that the autocalibration technique works well, even with a highly non-linear gas mixture. The single tube resolution varies between 50 and 175 \(\mu\)m in the range \(2\div 14\) mm. The drift properties of the mixture are well reproduced by the Garfield calculation [11] and by another independent measurement based on precise external detectors. The single tube efficiency is similar for Ar-CO\({}_{2}\) and Datcha gas mixtures.

The latter data sample allows a study of the systematics of the chamber mechanics and gas properties over a large area. The total drift time does not show variations for all the tubes of the chamber. No evidence of systematics effects at a level which exceeds 10 \(\mu\)m has been detected. Therefore, the autocalibration technique works well with the large-area data and converges to a compatible r-t relation.
