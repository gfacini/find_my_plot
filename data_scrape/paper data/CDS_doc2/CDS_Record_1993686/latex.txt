###### Abstract

The feasibility of measuring central exclusive jet production at ATLAS using the AFP detectors is presented. Two data-taking scenarios are considered; an average number of interactions per bunch crossing of \(\mu=23\) with integrated luminosity of 40 fb\({}^{-1}\) and \(\mu=46\) with integrated luminosity of 300 fb\({}^{-1}\). After the event selection, a signal-to-background ratio of 0.57 (0.16) for \(\mu=23\) (46) was achieved. The expected precision of the central exclusive dijet cross section measurement is shown with an estimation of the dominant systematic uncertainties.

Introduction

Central exclusive production (CEP) is a special class among diffractive processes. In these events, both protons remain intact and all of the energy lost by the interacting protons is used to produce the central system. The processes can be identified by tagging both of the outgoing protons in dedicated forward detectors and matching the kinematic properties of the central system to the kinematic properties of the tagged protons. As will be shown, this introduces very powerful experimental constraints to reduce the background.

By studying CEP of jets one can shed a light on topics connected to gluon distributions in proton, as such events are expected to be purely of gluonic nature. The measurement of exclusive jets will also set constraints on the exclusive Higgs production [1, 2].

The central exclusive jet production process is shown in Figure 1. In the KMR model [3] a perturbative approach is taken - the colourless exchange is represented by an exchange of two gluons; a hard and a soft one. The role of the soft gluon is to provide the colour screening that ensures no net colour is exchanged between the two protons. The exclusivity of the event is assured via a Sudakov form factor [4], which suppress the radiation of additional gluons. The two-gluon exchange and lack of additional radiation means that the central exclusive dijet production is extremely rare in comparison to standard dijet production at the LHC. In addition, the dijet system is produced in a \(J^{PC}=0^{++}\) state.

The KMR model is chosen because it best describes the Tevatron data [5] an is implemented in Monte Carlo event generators allowing a full detector simulation of the exclusive final state. However this model is not the only one available. For example, the Bialas-Landsoff exclusive model [6] is based on an exchange of two non-perturbative gluons exchanged between a pair of colliding hadrons which connect to the hard subprocess. The jet transverse momentum spectrum predicted by this model is in disagreement with the Tevatron data.

The KMR model has been embedded in the FPMC generator [7]. The cross section predicted at a centre-of-mass energy of \(\sqrt{s}=14\) TeV is about 0.5 pb for events in which the leading jet has a transverse momentum greater than 150 GeV. A precision measurement will only be possible with a few tens of inverse femtobarns, meaning that the analysis will have to be performed in a high pile-up environment. In the following analysis, two scenarios were considered: average number of interactions of \(\mu=23\) and \(\mu=46\). The integrated luminosity that is assumed to be collected during these runs is about 40 fb\({}^{-1}\) and 300 fb\({}^{-1}\) for \(\mu=23\) and \(\mu=46\), respectively.

## 2 ATLAS Detector

The ATLAS experiment [8] at the LHC is a multi-purpose particle detector with a forward-backward symmetric cylindrical geometry and a near \(4\pi\) coverage in solid angle1. It consists of an inner tracking detector surrounded by a thin superconducting solenoid that provides a 2 T axial magnetic field, electromagnetic and hadron calorimeters, and a muon spectrometer.

Footnote 1: ATLAS uses a right-handed coordinate system with its origin at the nominal interaction point (IP) in the centre of the detector and the \(z\)-axis along the beam pipe. The \(x\)-axis points from the IP to the centre of the LHC ring, and the \(y\)-axis points upwards. Cylindrical coordinates \((r,\phi)\) are used in the transverse plane, \(\phi\) being the azimuthal angle around the \(z\)-axis. The pseudorapidity is defined in terms of the polar angle \(\theta\) as \(\eta=-\ln\tan(\theta/2)\). Angular distance is measured in units of \(\Delta R\equiv\sqrt{\Delta\eta^{2}+\Delta\phi^{2}}\).

The inner tracking detector covers the pseudorapidity range \(|\eta|<2.5\). It consists of silicon pixel, silicon micro-strip, and transition radiation tracking detectors. Lead/liquid-argon (LAr) sampling calorimeters provide electromagnetic (EM) energy measurements with high granularity (\(|\eta|<3.2\)). A hadronic (iron/scintillator-tile) calorimeter covers the central pseudorapidity range (\(|\eta|<1.7\)). The hadronic end-cap and forward regions are instrumented with LAr calorimeters for both EM and hadronic energy measurements up to \(|\eta|=4.9\). The muon spectrometer surrounds the calorimeters and is based on three large air-core toroid superconducting magnets with eight coils each, providing a bending power in the range from 2 to 7.5 T\(\cdot\)m. The spectrometer includes a system of precision tracking chambers and detectors for triggering.

ATLAS is also equipped with several forward detectors that monitor collision conditions, provide instantaneous luminosity estimates and measure particles scattered at small angles. There are three existing forward detectors: LUminosity measurement using Cerenkov Integrating Detector (LUCID), the Zero Degree Calorimeter (ZDC) and Absolute Luminosity For ATLAS (ALFA).

A three-level trigger system is used to retain events for future offline analysis. The first-level trigger (L1) is implemented in hardware and uses a subset of the detector information to reduce the accepted rate to at most 100 kHz. This is followed by two software-based trigger levels (L2 and EF) that together reduce the accepted event rate to \(\leq 1\) kHz. Starting from the LHC Run II the L2 and EF triggers will be merged into one called High Level Trigger (HLT).

Dijet events are selected using single-jet triggers. Each such trigger selects events that contain a jet with transverse momentum above a certain threshold in the region of \(|\eta|<3.2\). Depending on the output rate, a single-jet trigger may be suppressed by recording only a predefined fraction of events. This suppression factor is referred to as a _prescale_. The exact values of prescales are set during each data-taking period, as they depend on the experimental conditions.

In Run-II, the LHC will operate with beam bunch separations of 25 ns and 50 ns. An amount of 40 fb\({}^{-1}\) of collected data with \(\mu=23\) would mean operating at instantaneous luminosity of \(L=5\cdot 10^{33}\) and \(L=10^{34}\) cm\({}^{-2}\)s\({}^{-1}\), respectively.

## 3 AFP Detector

An additional set of forward detectors have recently been proposed, known as the ATLAS Forward Proton detectors [9], which contains stations located at 204 m and 212 m either side of the ATLAS interaction point (IP). The stations located closer to the interaction point will contain tracking detectors, whereas the ones at 212 m will be equipped with tracking and timing devices. The AFP detectors are designed to collect data during various LHC conditions. The LHC collision optics are used in this feasibility study, with low values of the betatron function, \(\beta^{*}=0.55\) m, high beam intensity and highmultiplicity of colliding bunches. The extended discussion about the properties of the LHC optics on the protons visible in AFP can be found in Ref. [10].

The purpose of the AFP tracking system is to measure points along the trajectory of protons that were deflected during a proton-proton interaction. The active area covered by the tracking detector is approximately \(20\times 20\) mm\({}^{2}\) with a pixel size of \(50\times 250\)\(\mu\)m\({}^{2}\). At present, the design is not finalised and options of 4 or 5 staggered layers are considered. The spatial detector resolution is foreseen to be \(10\)\(\mu\)m in \(x\) and \(30\)\(\mu\)m in \(y\). The readout chip was chosen to be FE-I4, which was originally designed for the IBL project [11]. By having two detectors on each side of the IP one can measure not only the position of the proton with respect to the beam, but also its elevation angle.

The proton position from the beam and its elevation angle at the AFP detectors location is connected to the kinematics at the interaction point. In other words, by measuring the proton properties in the AFP one can unfold its initial four-momentum. This procedure is described in details in Ref. [12].

The range of energy and transverse momentum of the protons that can be registered by the AFP detectors are central to physics analysis. The geometric acceptance is defined as the ratio of the number of protons of a given relative energy loss (\(\xi=1-\text{E}_{\text{proton}}/\text{E}_{\text{beam}}\)) and transverse momentum (\(p_{T}\)) that reached the detector station to the total number of the scattered protons produced with that \(\xi\) and \(p_{T}\). The geometric acceptance for detectors located at 3.15 mm from the beam is shown in Figure 2 and approximately corresponds to \(0.02<\xi<0.12\). The position of the beam will be monitored by Beam Position Monitors, which are assumed to deliver precision better than \(100\)\(\mu\)m.

The timing detectors measure the time of arrival of each proton, providing a trigger signal to the ATLAS Central Trigger Processor (CTP) and allowing background reduction through the difference in proton time-of-flight measured on each side of the interaction point. In particular, the interaction vertex, is given by \(z_{ttx}=c\cdot(t_{A}-t_{C})\), where \(t_{A}\) and \(t_{C}\) are the time of arrival of each proton. This vertex can be compared to the primary interaction vertex to ensure that jets originate from the same interaction as the protons (see Section 6.2 for more details).

Figure 2: Geometric acceptance of the AFP detector as a function of the proton relative energy loss (\(\xi\)) and its transverse momentum (\(p_{T}\)) for the LHC collision optics. The factors taken into account are: the beam properties at the IP, the beam chamber and the detector geometries, the distance between the detector edge and the beam centre.

A timing resolution of 10 ps is assumed, which translates to vertex reconstruction resolution of about 2 mm. During the 2014 testbeam a resolution of \(\sim\)20 ps was obtained. Further improvements to the timing resolution are expected on the timescale of building the full AFP detector system.

## 4 Signal and Background Simulations

The central exclusive dijet events were generated using FPMC [7], with the KMR model. Following Ref. [13] a rapidity gap survival factor was set to 0.03. FPMC is a modification of Herwig 6.5 [14] and uses the standard final state parton shower and hadronisation algorithms in that generator. Initial state parton showers are forbidden and accounted for as a part of the exclusive calculation. Due to the exclusivity requirements all energy lost by interacting protons is in the produced jet system. Due to the distance from the beam assumed in this analysis, the minimal energy loss visible in the AFP detectors is \(\xi_{min}\approx 0.02\), which translates to the jet momentum of about 140-150 GeV. Therefore, the low-\(p_{T}\) jets must be produced in very forward direction, which significantly reduce the cross section. In consequence, considering jets with \(p_{T}>150\) GeV will not only enable an unprescaled trigger, but also specifies the phase-space region in which most of the signal is expected.

The exclusive jets can be also produced as a results of photon-photon interaction. However, as this process is of electromagnetic nature, the expected cross section is much smaller than the considered KMR approach, thus it was not considered.

The signal, two central jets and two intact protons, can be produced by Non-Diffractive (ND) or Single Diffractive (SD) dijet system from one interaction overlaid with intact protons coming from the other pp interactions in the same beam bunch crossing. An additional background comes from Double Pomeron Exchange (DPE) jet production.

A DPE process is very similar to the exclusive one: two central jets and two intact protons are produced. However, in this process hard gluons are taken from the emitted Pomerons, thus there are Pomeron remnants present in the event. Therefore, the kinematics of the jet system are not strongly correlated to the ones of the proton system. Moreover, contrary to the exclusive production, in DPE processes the spin-selection rules and Sudakov suppression are not applicable. However, the cases in which the amount of energy carried by the remnants is small, the DPE process resembles the exclusive one (see Ref. [5]).

Non-diffractive dijet events were produced using the Pythia8 generator [15] with MSTW2008LO PDF and A2MSTW2008LO tune [16] for underlying event activity. The initial cross section for jets with \(p_{T}>150\) GeV of \(6.45\cdot 10^{10}\) fb was taken directly from the generator. Single and double Pomeron exchange events were produced using Herwig++ 2.5 [17], with a soft-survival factor of 0.1 and 0.03 respectively. The events were produced using the resolved Pomeron model with the Ingelman-Schellin model [18] using H1 2007 Fit B [19] and EE-3-CTEQ6L1 [20] tune. The multiparton interactions (MPI) were turned off due to the fact that Herwig cannot handle MPI in diffractive events.

The additional proton-proton interactions in each bunch crossing were generated by Pythia8 with A2MSTW2008LO tune and single dif Diffraction, double diffraction and low \(p_{T}\) scattering processes switched on.

In order to simulate the detector response, all events were reconstructed using the ATLAS full simulation chain [21]. The chain consists of four main steps. The first one is the Monte Carlo (MC) generation, where for each event a set of particles with their momenta is produced. The second step is the detector simulation, where interactions between the produced particles and the material of the ATLAS detector is simulated. This results in energy deposits in the detector. In the third step, called digitisation, the response of the detector electronics is simulated. As the result, one obtains data similar to the those from a real measurement. The last step is processing the event through the reconstruction software in order to extract information on reconstructed particles.

At the time of the analysis the full Geant 4 simulation of the AFP detector was not available. Instead, a fast simulation was performed. First, a vertex position was smeared accordingly to the size of the beam (16 \(\mu\)m in \(x\) and \(y\), 55 mm in \(z\)). Then a proton transport trough the LHC structures between the ATLAS IP and the AFP detectors was calculated using the FPTrack[22] program. Next, the position reconstructed in the AFP was smeared accordingly to the foreseen detector resolution. Finally, the timing detector resolution was considered.

Later studies based on full Geant 4 simulation shown that the position and timing reconstruction efficiency is \(\gtrsim 60\%\) for the double tagged events. Considering this, the final event yield is scaled accordingly.

## 5 Trigger Strategy

To maximise the sensitivity of the measurement, it is necessary to have a fully efficient, unprescaled trigger for jets with \(p_{T}>150\) GeV with a rate of about 10 Hz. Unfortunately, such a jet trigger in the standard ATLAS trigger menu would be heavily prescaled during data taking. Indeed, the Run-I jet trigger with an EF threshold of 145 GeV was prescaled by a factor of 1000 in runs with \(\sqrt{s}=8\) TeV and instantaneous luminosity of \(L\sim 6\cdot 10^{33}\) cm\({}^{-2}\)s\({}^{-1}\). A dedicated trigger chain is therefore needed to select the exclusive dijet events.

At Level 1, the jet information can be supplemented with information from the AFP detector, to select events with a proton reconstructed on each side of the interaction point. This would reduce the rate by a factor of 10, resulting in an overall L1 rate of few hundreds Hz (approximately 1% of the total L1 budget).

Additional rate reductions are possible using HLT triggers. The constraints could come from cuts on variables that relate the kinematics measured in the forward detectors to that measured from the jet four vectors (see Section 6.2 for details of variables and associated distributions). In particular, a relaxed cut on the dijet rapidity difference of \(|y_{jj}-y_{x}|>0.3\) will remove 80% of background. A requirement on the dijet mass fraction of \(0.8<m_{jj}/m_{x}<1.3\) will reduce it further by a factor of 5. To sum up, the overall rate could be reduced by the factor of 10 on L1 and by further factor of 25 on the HLT. The approximate rates given an instantaneous luminosity of \(5\cdot 10^{33}\) cm\({}^{-2}\)s\({}^{-1}\) or \(10^{34}\) cm\({}^{-2}\)s\({}^{-1}\) are listed in Table 1.

Taking into account the uncertainties due to jet calibration, the mass fraction requirement could

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{c|c|c|c} \hline \hline \multirow{2}{*}{**Requirement**} & **Trigger** & \multicolumn{2}{c}{**Rate [Hz]**} \\  & **Level** & **10\({}^{34}\) cm\({}^{-2}\)s\({}^{-1}\)** & **5 \(\cdot\) 10\({}^{33}\) cm\({}^{-2}\)s\({}^{-1}\)** \\ \hline non-diffractive jets with \(p_{T}>150\) GeV & L1 & 8000 & 4000 \\ AFP double tag & L1 & 800 & 400 \\ non-diffractive jets with \(p_{T}>150\) GeV & HLT & 600 & 300 \\ rapidity ratio & HLT & 120 & 60 \\ mass fraction & HLT & 24 & 12 \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}

be further loosened. If needed, more constraints could come from new ATLAS topological trigger (as discussed in Ref. [23]) or a very loose cut on the track multiplicity at primary vertex.

## 6 Event Selection

### Object and Event Preselection

Jets were reconstructed at the electromagnetic (EM) scale using the anti-\(k_{t}\) algorithm [24] with distance parameter \(R=0.6\) and full four-momentum recombination. The input objects to the jet algorithm were three-dimensional topological clusters (so-called _topoclusters_[25]) built from calorimeter cells. The ATLAS jets are initially reconstructed with respect to the nominal ATLAS geometric center (\(0,0,0\)). To avoid a possible bias in \(p_{T}\) and rapidity, the jet kinematics are subsequently corrected using MC-based and data-driven correction factors [26]. The procedure described above is standard ATLAS jet reconstruction.

The directions of the two leading jets were required to satisfy \(|\eta|<2.8\) and each jet was matched to the interaction vertex with the highest sum of track transverse momenta (the primary vertex) by requiring the jet vertex action [27] was greater than 0.85.

Tracks used in the analysis were required to originate from the the primary vertex. Each track was checked to pass quality requirements as defined in Ref. [28].

In order to reconstruct the proton energy and momentum from its trajectory position measurements in the AFP stations, the parametrisation and unfolding procedure [12] encoded in standalone tools, was employed. In order to study given effect, the protons were Gaussian smeared. The average of difference between between the true and unfolded variable was taken as the reconstruction resolution.

The reconstruction precision of the proton energy for the LHC collision optics and the AFP detector case is presented in Figure 3 (left). The main uncertainty comes from the detector resolution of 10 \(\mu\)m in \(x\) and 30 \(\mu\)m in \(y\). The lack of knowledge about the vertex and the multiple scattering effect are much smaller, except for the low values of \(\xi\) where the lack of knowledge about the vertex is a dominant factor. In the presented plots the effect of the proton beam spread is not shown. However, its impact is known (see Ref. [29]) to be at a level of multiple scattering, thus it would not contribute significantly to the final reconstruction resolution. The reconstruction resolution changes from 5 GeV for \(\xi=0.04\) to 10 GeV for \(\xi=0.14\). The reconstruction precision of proton momentum is presented in Figure 3 (right). Here all uncertainties contribute equally. The reconstruction resolution is about 0.1 GeV for \(p_{T}<1\). It is worth stressing that uncertainty caused by the AFP reconstruction resolution is much smaller than other effects (like the jet energy scale).

### Signal Selection

One proton is required in each AFP station, which reduces the ND background by an order of magnitude. The difference between the primary vertex \(z\) position reconstructed by the ATLAS main detector and the one reconstructed from the AFP time measurement, \(\Delta z\), is required to be less than 3.5 mm.

The \(\Delta z\) distribution for signal and background events is shown in Figure 4. The broad \(\Delta z\) distribution in case of the ND and SD jet production are due to the size of the beamspot, since in these cases proton(s) are coming from pile-up interactions. The tails in case of DPE jet production are due to the events in which one 'hard' proton was lost before the AFP, but there was an additional pile-up proton. For DPE jets with \(p_{T}>150\) GeV such situation is quite probable as protons are expected to lose a lot of their initial energy (see later discussion on the mass ratio). The exclusive signal was generated with both protons in the AFP acceptance. In such a case the width is only due to the AFP timing resolution. When more than one proton was observed in a given station, all combinatoric possibilities were considered and the one with the smallest \(\Delta z\) was taken.

For signal events, the kinematics of the central dijet system can be estimated from forward proton measurements, with the dijet invariant mass being given by \(m_{X}=\sqrt{s\cdot\xi_{1}\cdot\xi_{2}}\) and the rapidity given by \(y_{X}=0.5\cdot\ln\left(\frac{\xi_{1}}{\xi_{2}}\right)\), where \(\xi_{1,2}\) is proton relative energy loss. This can be correlated to the mass (\(m_{jj}\)) and rapidity (\(y_{jj}\)) of the dijet system reconstructed from the jet four-momenta. The left panel of Figure 5 shows the ratio of the dijet mass reconstructed from the jet four-vectors to that obtained from the proton kinematics. The exclusive signal can be enhanced with respect to the background by the following cuts: \(-0.075<y_{jj}-y_{X}<0.075\) and \(0.9<\frac{m_{jj}}{m_{X}}<1.15\). These requirements provides further background reduction by about three orders of magnitude.

The lack of underlying event activity and proton/Pomeron remnants provides another handle to improve the signal purity. The distributions of number of tracks outside the jet system in \(\eta\) and the number of tracks perpendicular to the leading jet in \(\phi\) are shown in Fig. 6 (left) and (right), correspondingly. A track is considered to be outside the jet system if both following criteria are fulfilled: \(\eta_{trk}>\eta_{jet}+0.7\) and \(\eta_{trk}>\eta_{jet}+w_{jet}+0.2\), where \(w_{jet}\) is the reconstructed jet width [24]. These equations are valid only for tracks with \(\eta>0\), but the requirement for the other cases is trivial. The track was considered as perpendicular in \(\phi\) to the leading jet if \(\frac{\pi}{3}<\Delta\phi<\frac{2\pi}{3}\) or \(\frac{4\pi}{3}<\Delta\phi<\frac{5\pi}{3}\), where \(\Delta\phi\) is the difference between azimuthal angle of track and the leading jet. The dashed lines represent cut values. These requirements reduce the background by almost two orders of magnitude. This is similar to the rejection factor obtained in Ref. [2], which examined Pythia 6[30] and Herwig 6.5 event generators. The long tail of the track multiplicity for signal events is due to final state parton showering, hadronisation, an pile-up events overlapping with the primary vertex.

Three additional selection criteria were applied:

* azimuthal angle between two leading jets \(2.9<\Delta\phi<3.3\); exclusive jets are expected to be produced back-to-back,

Figure 3: Proton energy (**left**) and transverse momentum (**right**) reconstruction resolution. The experimental effects taken into account are: the AFP detector spatial resolution, the lack of information about the vertex coordinates and the multiple scattering effect.

The integral of the distribution is normalised to 1. The AFP time resolution of 10 ps has been assumed for background rejection. The exclusive signal is plotted as a solid black line, whereas the backgrounds are a dotted green (non-diffractive jet production), dashed-dotted blue (single diffractive jet production) and dashed red (double Pomeron exchange jet production) lines. The black dashed line represents the value of the applied cut.

The \(\xi_{1}\) and \(\xi_{2}\) are relative energy losses of protons tagged in the AFP stations. The integral of the distribution is normalised to 1. The black dashed line represents the value of the applied cut.

* missing mass \(m_{X}<550\) GeV/c\({}^{2}\); the \(\xi\) distributions falls much quicker for the exclusive jets production,
* the mass fraction is required to be \(0.9<R_{j}<1.3\); this variable was proposed in Ref. [31] to reduce the effects of hard state radiation and is strongly correlated with mass ratio and rapidity difference requirements.

The applied requirements together with their values are summarised in Table 2.

The change in fiducial cross section for signal and background processes after each selection requirement for an integrated luminosity of 40 fb\({}^{-1}\) and average number of interactions of \(\mu=23\) is

visualised in Figure 7 and listed in Table 3. The dominant background is from the non-diffractive jet production overlaid with protons from pile-up interactions. After all selection requirements the signal to background ratio increased from \(10^{-6}\) to \(\sim 0.57\).

The analysis was repeated for the average number of interactions of 46 and an integrated luminosity of 300 fb\({}^{-1}\). The selection criteria for these conditions are similar to the ones used in the \(\mu=23\) analysis. The dominant background from ND dijet events overlaid with protons from minimum bias events increases with respect to the signal. This is because the probability of producing this combinatorial background increases quadratically with the number of interactions per beam bunch crossing.

## 7 Systematic Effects

The uncertainty in the jet energy scale (JES) and jet energy resolution (JER) is assumed to be 3% and 4% respectively, _i.e._ similar to that obtained during the LHC Run I [26, 32].

The non-diffractive background shape and normalisation will be estimated using data-driven methods, with dedicated control regions defined by reversing the timing cut. The uncertainty on this procedure will then be associated with extrapolating the results into the signal region. If the uncertainty on the signal cross section is required to be below 10% an overall modelling uncertainty on the non-diffractive background of at most 6% at \(\mu=23\) is required. This value is likely to be conservative because the non-diffractive background is estimated in control regions for which the statistical precision will be much better than 6%. In the remainder of this analysis an uncertainty of 6% on the ND background is assumed.

The uncertainty on the DPE and SD backgrounds is estimated to be approximately 20-30% based on the Pomeron structure function measurements at HERA [19]. This has only a 3% effect at \(\mu=23\). Moreover, dedicated measurements of SD and DPE jets in low pile-up, low luminosity conditions with AFP would help in further constrains of these backgrounds. In the remainder of this analysis an uncertainty of 20% on the SD and DPE backgrounds is assumed.

Figure 7: The number of events accepted after a particular cut for signal (exclusive jet production) and background (double Pomeron exchange (DPE), single diffractive (SD) and non-diffractive (ND) jet production) processes for the integrated luminosity of 40 fb\({}^{-1}\) and average number of interactions of \(\mu=23\) as a function of the applied consecutive cuts. The AFP time resolution of 10 ps has been assumed for background rejection.

For the case of \(\mu=46\) these modelling uncertainties are set at the same values in order to be consistent with \(\mu=23\) analysis. The final result has large error, mainly due to the fact that the final sample is dominated by ND background. However, if by using a data driven methods the modelling uncertainty could be reduced to 1.5%, this contribution to the error on cross section will decreased to about 10%. This will make such measurement significant even in \(\mu=46\) environment. Alternatively, an improvement in the timing detector resolution would also result in a reduction in the overall uncertainty, by reducing the size of the ND background.

The other important issue is the systematic effects coming from the beam conditions which may vary from fill to fill. In Ref. [33] it was shown that in order too keep the error on \(\xi\) reconstruction resolution below few percent one needs to align the detectors with the precision of at least 100 \(\mu\)m. In addition, the error on the position of the beam centre at the location of the AFP station should be smaller than 100 \(\mu\)m.

## 8 Results

The leading jet transverse momentum above a given threshold for the integrated luminosity \(L=40\) fb\({}^{-1}\) and average number of interactions of \(\mu=23\) is presented in Fig. 8 (left). In this plot the exclusive signal is represented by a yellow area. The background consists of double Pomeron exchange (red), single diffractive (blue) and non-diffractive (green) jet production processes. The total number of events is marked as black line.

the same as in the previous case, the impact of statistical and background uncertainties is very large. Improvements in the AFP timing detector resolution or the analysis method are needed to control the background modelling uncertainties. For example, if the background measured in control regions to an accuracy of \(\sim 1\%\) then the accuracy of the cross section measurement would be similar to that shown in Fig. 8 (right) for \(\mu=23\).

## 9 Summary

The cross section for the central exclusive jet production is about 0.5 pb for \(\sqrt{s}=14\) TeV and a transverse momentum of the leading jet \(p_{T}>150\) GeV. Therefore, in order to have a precise measurement, the data will have to be collected during the nominal LHC operation, with a large pile-up environment. This condition introduces combinatorial backgrounds as the exclusive signal will be mimicked by non-diffractive and single diffractive jets with forward protons coming from additional proton-proton interactions. The analysis presented above was performed for two different experimental conditions:

* integrated luminosity \(L=40\) fb\({}^{-1}\) and \(\mu=23\),
* integrated luminosity \(L=300\) fb\({}^{-1}\) and \(\mu=46\).

The initial signal to background ratio is about \(10^{-6}\). After dedicated signal selection cuts have been applied, the signal-to-background ratio was about 0.57 (0.16) for \(\mu=23\) (46). In both cases the statistical errors are considerably small. The biggest uncertainty is associated with the modelling of the combinatorial background from ND dijet events overlapping with two protons from pile-up events. The impact of the ND background on the measurement ultimately depends on the success of

data-driven methods using dedicated using control regions. In case of \(L=40\) fb\({}^{-1}\) and \(\mu=23\), the measurement seems to be challenging, but feasible. In order to make such measurement in higher pile-up environment, much better knowledge about the systematic effects is needed.
