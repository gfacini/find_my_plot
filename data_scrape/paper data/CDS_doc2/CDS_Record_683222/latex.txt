This report describes the conceptual design and the cost estimate of conventional iron end-cap toroidal magnets to be placed in the superconducting barrel toroid of the ATLAS LHC-detector. Part of this design is a rail system which is used to support the end-cap toroids and allows for their displacement in axial direction. The same rail system serves also to support and displace the calorimeter barrel.

January 9, 19931) INTRODUCTION

One of the proposed magnet configurations for the LHC-detector of the ATLAS Collaboration is a large volume-field produced by a superconducting air-core barrel toroid. It is composed of 12 race-track shaped coils giving an open structure with easy access for the installation of the muon detection system. The barrel magnet covering the central section of the detector is described in (1).

The possibility to complement the barrel magnet at large rapidity by conventional iron end-cap toroidal magnets has been investigated. The prefered solution is an arrangement of twin end-caps which makes it possible to place a tracking chamber in between the inner and outer modules (Fig. 1 and 3). The modules are installed on rollers on a rail system and can be retracted in the beam direction. The same rail system is used for the displacement of the calorimeter barrel and end-caps (Fig. 2). The left side of Fig. 2 shows an axial view upon the end-caps, the right side shows a cut through the calorimeter barrel (here for the case of a full LAr calorimeter) and the iron for the flux return of the inner solenoid.

This report presents the conceptual engineering design of the conventional forward toroidal magnets. Furthermore it describes the rail system to be used for the displacement of these magnets. At the end it gives cost estimates for the different items.

2) CONVENTIONAL IRON END-CAPS

2.1) Mechanical arrangement of the forward magnet system

Each end-cap module has a length of 2 m in axial direction. The inner module has an outer radius of 4 600 mm and weighs 920 t, the outer module with a radius of 4 930 mm weighs 1040 t. Each module consists of 12 azimuthal sectors, every one equipped with a conventional Al-coil of about 200 cm\({}^{2}\) cross-section (Fig. 3 and 4). The maximum weight of one azimuthal sector is = 87 t. In axial direction, it is made of 9 iron plates of 20 cm thickness, interleaved along the radial faces with 2.5 cm thick spacers. The free space between the iron plates allows for the installation of e.g. plastic streamer tubes to detect energy loss from electromagnetic radiation and to help in pattern recognition. The iron plates of one sector are welded together along the spacers. Only the radial faces of each sector are machined to provide a maximum magnetic contact between neighbouring sectors when being screwed together. The relative position of neighbouring sectors will be fixed by dowels. Two sectors of each module are equipped with rollers to allow for their axial displacement.

Each module will be pre-assembled on the surface either in two halves and then lowered into the underground area using the 2 x 250 t cranes, or lowered as a single unit by the heavy-load crane.

### Magnetic field values and coils

If rolled low-carbon steel is used, a current of 182 kA-turns is required to reach a magnetic field of 1.8 T at a median radius R\({}_{\text{m}}\) = 2.9 m. For the layout of the coils and the power supplies a contingency of the current of 50 % is considered to take into account a possible degrading of the magnetic qualities of the iron due to weldings, different production charges, and possible air gaps.

This field can be obtained using conventional Al-coils of 24 turns each with a water-cooled conductor of 24 x 24 mm\({}^{2}\) cross-section and a hole of 11 mm diameter. Every magnet sector is equipped with one coil. All 12 coils of one end-cap module are connected in series to a standard power supply of 1000A/200V. The dissipated power is about 200 kW per module. The small cross-section of the conductor and the approximate size of 4 x 2 m\({}^{2}\) of the coils allow a conventional production without technological risk.

The main parameters of the iron toroid end-caps are summarized in the following table:

\begin{tabular}{l c}  & values per end-cap \\  & (two modules) \\ median field & 1.8 T \\ Ampereturns (nominal) & 2 x 182 kA \\ dissipated power & 2 x 200 kW \\ stored energy & 2 x 2 MJ \\ iron weight & 920 t + 1040 t = 1960 t \\ conductor weight & 131 \\ \end{tabular}

### Magnetic forces acting on the barrel coil

The magnetic forces acting on the barrel coils were calculated with the computer program TOSCA. The calculations are based on a current of 2 MA per coil, uniformly distributed over the area of the two pancakes of the coil; the dimensions of the coils and pancakes are taken from (1).

Figure 5 gives the forces in t/m at the barrel coils without the presence of the iron end-caps; it results in a net radial inward force at each coil. The presence of the magnetized iron end-caps creates additional forces at the parts of the barrel coils which are close to the end-caps. These additional magnetic forces are shown in Fig. 6, also in t/m. The additional forces depend on the distance of the iron of the end-cap modules from the barrel coils. They are considerably smaller for the smaller radius of the inner end-cap modules.

For the outer end-cap modules, which are closest to the barrel coils, an out-of-centre force was calculated in order to study the influence of misalignments. If the out-of-centre displacement (measured in cm) is in the direction of an end-cap coil, an unbalanced force of 19.6 t/cm acts on the end-cap in this direction. In the case of a displacement in the direction of a barrel coil this force is 18.9 t/cm.

Due to edge effects of the barrel toroidal field the outer end-cap modules are pulled axially towards the detector centre with a force of 42.2 t; the force on the inner modules is negligible. This axial force is taken up by mechanical stoppers between the different detector modules.

### Magnetic field characteristics

The field shape in the end-caps has been calculated using the computer programs POISSON and TOSCA. If the barrel toroidal field is not switched on the field in the end-caps varies radially in a sector from 1.97 T at an inner radius of 1 m to 1.73 T at the outer part; Fig. 7 shows the flux contour lines and the field values. If the toroidal field is switched on it influences the magnetization of the iron in different ways, depending on the relative orientation of the barrel and end-cap fields. Figure 8 shows this effect for the case where barrel and end-cap fields have the same orientation.

In Fig. 9 the field integral is given as a function of pseudorapidity for azimuthal angles phi = 0\({}^{\mathrm{o}}\), 7.5\({}^{\mathrm{o}}\) and 15\({}^{\mathrm{o}}\), this is without any radial cut. The angle 0\({}^{\mathrm{o}}\) corresponds to the vertical axis containing the plane between two end-cap sectors, 15\({}^{\mathrm{o}}\) corresponds to an axis containing the plane of a sc-barrel coil.

The magnetic field at the position of the inner barrel conductors caused by the end-cap coils and their magnetization of the iron was calculated to be between 10 and 15 Gauss and seems not to be able to cause a quench due to an end-cap current interruption.

### RAIL SYSTEM AND SUPPORT STRUCTURE

The calorimeter modules and the end-cap toroids are not tied to the air-core toroid structure. The first ones are supported by two rails, running parallel to the beam line through the air-core barrel over the full length of the cavern, whereas the aire-core toroid is supported by two pairs of feet at the axial ends, as shown in Fig. 1 and 2. This separation of the support structures allows easy installation and facilitates the access to all detector systems, once the barrel toroid is in place; e.g. retracting the end-cap toroids and the calorimeter end-caps by a few meters provides access to the electronics of the calorimeter and the inner tracking detectors.

The rail support structure consists of 6.40 m height feet, each one weighing = 20 t, which are fixed to the floor. The bottom part of the feet is extended laterally in order not to exceed a specific floor load of 100 - 130 t/m\({}^{2}\). Consecutive feet are separated by 1.20 m for the passage of the cold tie bars between adjacent coils of the barrel toroid (Fig. 10 and 11). Opposite feet will be cross-tied through holes in the web plate of the sc-barrel coils. The strength of the structure has been calculated with the FE-program CASTEM 2000.

The rail system of the ATLAS detector has to allow the displacement of individual detector elements of up to = 2 300 t in a height of = 7 m above floor level. For this purpose roller systems similar to the ones used in the ALEPH and DELPHI detectors will be used (Fig. 12). The maximum linear charge transmitted by the roller system to the rails is \(\simeq\) 275 t/m.

Due to the presence of the rail support feet the muon chambers in these areas have to be of special size. In order to have muon chambers of equal width there, the distances between the stabilization ribs of one foot and of neighbouring feet are equal (Fig. 11).

The arrangement of discrete rail support feet allows the lowering and installation of the pre-assembled air-core toroid section in between the support feet already fixed to the floor. The air-core toroid is then tied to its own support feet. After installation of the lower toroid section the rails will be fixed on top of the support feet to allow the rolling in of the inner detector elements. The LHC beam will have a small slope of about 1 mrad with respect to the foreseen experimental hall. For ease of physics analysis the rails will be mounted parallel to the LHC beam.

From experience with tunnels and other underground buildings e.g. LEP caverns it is known that small movements of the whole underground structure in respect to a fixed system can occur. To cope with such possible changes of the floor level of the experimental hall in respect to the LHC particle beam the height of the rails can be re-adjusted up to about \(\pm\)2.5 cm. This can be done with the help of hydraulic jacks which are placed between rail and lateral extentions at the top of each support feet (Fig. 12). The new position will then be fixed by adjusting screws.

In the barrel section the rail support feet have to traverse the magnetic field of two of the 12 coil sections. These feet will therefore be of stainless steel or other magnetic steel; all others outside the magnetic field inclusive the rails can be of ordinary construction steel. Outside the detector the rail support feet could be of shorter length depending on the decision on the height of the floor level of the cavern. The support feet will either be cast or solidly welded from laminated plates subject to the production possibilities of the industry and cost.

4) DISPLACEMENT SYSTEM

To move the end-cap toroids or calorimeter modules along the rails a system with hydraulic jacks similar to the one of the ALEPH and DELPHI detectors is foreseen. It will be constructed such that in the stand-by position it is fixed to each of the two outer end-cap modules. In case of need for access to an inner detector part the corresponding outer end-cap will be displaced far enough outwards. Afterwards the hydraulic jacks of the moved end-cap will be mounted at the next inner detector element to be moved and so on.

5) COST ESTIMATES

Laminated low carbon iron plates of 20 cm thickness are the basic elements for the end-cap modules. The flame cutted plates will be welded
