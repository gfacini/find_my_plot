## 1 Introduction

After the discovery of the Higgs boson by the ATLAS [1] and CMS [2] experiments, the properties of this new particle have been probed by the two experiments, testing their compatibility with the prediction of the Standard Model (SM). During the two runs of data-taking of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN, the Higgs production cross-sections and decay branching ratios in various channels have been measured with an increasing precision, as well as the Higgs boson couplings with the SM particles [3, 4, 5]. Nevertheless the properties of the Higgs scalar potential, and in particular the Higgs boson self-coupling, are still largely unconstrained. The most recent constraints on the Higgs boson trilinear self-coupling, \(\lambda_{HHH}\), have been set in the context of a direct search of double Higgs boson production. Results are reported in terms of \(\kappa_{\lambda}=\lambda_{HHH}/\lambda_{HHH}^{SM}\), which is the ratio of the Higgs boson self-coupling to its SM expectation. It is constrained to at 95% confidence level (C.L.) to \(-5.0<\kappa_{\lambda}<12.1\)[6] and \(-11.8<\kappa_{\lambda}<18.8\)[7] by ATLAS and CMS, respectively, using up to 36 fb\({}^{-1}\)of Run-2 data.

An alternative and complementary approach to study the Higgs boson self-coupling has been proposed in the Refs. [8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13]. Single Higgs processes do not depend on \(\lambda_{HHH}\) at leading order (LO), but the Higgs trilinear self-coupling contributions need to be taken into account for the calculation of the complete next-to-leading (NLO) electro-weak (EW) corrections. In particular, \(\lambda_{HHH}\) contributes at NLO EW via Higgs self energy loop corrections and additional diagrams, as shown by the examples in Figure 1. Therefore, an indirect constraint on \(\lambda_{HHH}\) can be extracted by comparing precise measurements of single Higgs production yields and the SM predictions corrected for the \(\lambda_{HHH}\)-dependent NLO EW effects. Refs. [8, 9] propose a framework for a global fit to constrain the Higgs trilinear coupling, where all the Higgs boson production and decay channels are modified by parameters:

\[\mu_{if}(\kappa_{\lambda})=\mu_{i}(\kappa_{\lambda})\times\mu_{f}(\kappa_{ \lambda})\equiv\frac{\sigma_{i}(\kappa_{\lambda})}{\sigma_{\text{SM},i}} \times\frac{\text{BR}_{f}(\kappa_{\lambda})}{\text{BR}_{\text{SM},f}}\,, \tag{1}\]

Figure 1: Examples of one loop \(\lambda_{HHH}\)-dependent diagrams for the Higgs boson self energy (a) and the single Higgs boson production in the VBF (b), \(VH\) (c), and \(t\overline{t}H\) (d) modes. The self-coupling vertex is indicated by the filled circle.

where \(\mu_{i}\) and \(\mu_{f}\) describe respectively the multiplicative corrections of the expected SM Higgs production cross-sections (\(\sigma_{\text{SM},i}\)) and each decay channel branching fraction (\(\text{BR}_{\text{SM},f}\)) as a function of the anomalous values of the trilinear Higgs self-coupling \(\kappa_{\lambda}\). The functional dependence of \(\mu_{i}(\kappa_{\lambda})\) and \(\mu_{f}(\kappa_{\lambda})\) on \(\kappa_{\lambda}\) varies according to the production mode and the decay channel. Moreover, these functions depend on the kinematic region considered within each process, especially for the \(VH\) and \(t\bar{t}H\) production modes. In this work, the differential distributions of the \(V\)BF, \(WH\)  and \(ZH\) production modes are exploited to constrain \(\kappa_{\lambda}\) by using the cross-section measurements in regions defined within the simplified template cross-section (STXS) framework [14; 15].

The note describes a global fit of \(\kappa_{\lambda}\) based on the combined measurements of single Higgs production and decay rates [4]. They include analyses targeting the \(H\to\gamma\gamma\)[16; 17; 18], \(H\to ZZ^{*}\)[19; 20], \(VH\), \(H\to b\bar{b}\)[21; 22], \(H\to WW^{*}\)[23], and \(H\to\tau\tau\)[24] decay channels, as well as two analyses targeting Higgs boson associated production with a top-antitop pair, in \(b\bar{b}\) and multileptons final states [25; 26]. The results presented are obtained using data collected at \(\sqrt{s}=13\) TeV with an integrated luminosity ranging from 36.1 fb\({}^{-1}\)to 79.1 fb\({}^{-1}\).

The note is organized as follows: Section 2 reviews the dataset and input measurements, Section 3 summarises briefly the theoretical framework, Section 4 discusses the statistical model, Section 5 presents the results of the fit, and Section 6 provides a summary.

## 2 Data and input measurement

The results shown in this note are based on data collected by the ATLAS experiment [27; 28] in 2015, 2016 and 2017. The integrated luminosities for the analysed Higgs boson decay channels are summarised in Table 1.

Details about the individual analyses can be found in the references reported in the same table. Each analysis separates the selected events into orthogonal kinematic and topological regions, called categories, that are summarized in Table 2.

The categories, defined according to the reconstructed final state, are designed to maximize the sensitivity to each truth-level region defined within the simplified template cross-section framework [14; 15]. In particular, they are based on the stage-1 of the STXS framework within which, depending on Higgs boson production mode, the phase space is subdivided as follows:

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{l c c} \hline \hline Analysis & Integrated luminosity (fb\({}^{-1}\)) & Ref. \\ \hline \(H\to\gamma\gamma\) (including \(t\bar{t}H\), \(H\to\gamma\gamma\)) & 79.8 & [16; 17; 18] \\ \(H\to ZZ^{*}\to 4\ell\) (including \(t\bar{t}H\), \(H\to ZZ^{*}\to 4\ell\)) & 79.8 & [19; 20] \\ \(H\to WW^{*}\to e\nu\mu\nu\) & 36.1 & [23] \\ \(H\to\tau\tau\) & 36.1 & [24] \\ \(VH\), \(H\to b\bar{b}\) & 79.8 & [21; 22] \\ \(t\bar{t}H\), \(H\to b\bar{b}\) and \(t\bar{t}H\) multilepton & 36.1 & [25; 26] \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}

* the gluon-fusion production mode is subdivided in regions of jet multiplicity and transverse momentum of the Higgs boson, \(p_{\rm T}^{H}\). Additionally, two regions with \(V\)BF-like kinematics, defined by the presence of two jets with large dijet mass, are also considered. The \(b\bar{b}H\) and \(gg\to Z(had)H\) production modes are considered as small additional contributions to the expected yield in these regions;
* quark-initiated production processes \(qq\to Hqq\) are split into a region with a high-\(\rm p_{T}\) jet, two VBF-like regions, a region with two jets consistent with \(V(\to qq)H\) production, and a region for the remaining events;
* leptonic decays of the vector boson in \(VH\) and \(gg\to ZH\) production modes are split into \(qq\to H\ell\nu\), \(qq\to H\ell\ell\) and \(qq\to H\nu\nu\) final states, and further split as a function of the vector-boson transverse momentum \(\rm p_{T}^{V}\);
* the \(t\bar{t}H\) and \(tH\) production modes are considered inclusively in one single region.

## 3 Theoretical model

Following Refs. [8; 9], in the present work the trilinear Higgs boson self coupling scales with \(\kappa_{\lambda}\) and the dependence of the Higgs boson production cross-sections on \(\kappa_{\lambda}\) is described by the relation:

\[\mu_{i}(\kappa_{\lambda},\kappa_{i})=\frac{\sigma^{\rm BSM}}{\sigma^{\rm SM}}=Z _{H}^{\rm BSM}\left(\kappa_{\lambda}\right)\left[\kappa_{i}^{2}+\frac{(\kappa_ {\lambda}-1)C_{1}^{i}}{K_{\rm EW}^{i}}\right]\,, \tag{2}\]

where \(Z_{H}^{\rm BSM}\left(\kappa_{\lambda}\right)\) is defined as:

\[Z_{H}^{\rm BSM}\left(\kappa_{\lambda}\right)=\frac{1}{1-(\kappa_{\lambda}^{2} -1)\delta Z_{H}}\quad\mbox{with}\quad\delta Z_{H}=-1.536\times 10^{-3}\,, \tag{3}\]

\(K_{\rm EW}^{i}=\frac{\sigma_{\rm NLO}^{\rm SM}}{\sigma_{\rm LO}^{\rm SM}}\) accounts for the complete NLO EW correction of the production cross section for the process \(i\) in the SM hypothesis (_i.e._\(\kappa_{\lambda}=1\)), \(C_{1}^{i}\) is a process and kinematics-dependent linear coefficient that provides the sensitivity of the measurement to \(\kappa_{\lambda}\), and \(\kappa_{i}^{2}=\frac{\sigma_{\rm LO}^{\rm BSM}}{\sigma_{\rm LO}^{\rm SM}}( \kappa_{\lambda}=1)\) represents multiplicative modifiers to other Higgs boson couplings, parametrised as in the LO \(\kappa\)-framework [29]. In this work, only two coupling modifiers \(\kappa_{F}\) and \(\kappa_{V}\) are considered. They describe the modifications of the SM Higgs boson coupling to fermions and to massive vector bosons, respectively. As discussed in Ref. [9], for small deviations of \(\kappa_{F}\) and \(\kappa_{V}\) from 1, the dependence of NLO EW corrections on these coupling modifiers can be neglected. The values of these quantities for ggF, \(V\)BF, \(ZH\), \(WH\) and \(t\bar{t}H\) production modes are shown in Table 3, where the values of \(C_{1}^{i}\) and \(K_{\rm EW}^{i}\) are averaged over the full phase space of these processes.

The variation of the trilinear coupling \(\lambda_{HHH}\) affects also the Higgs boson decay rates. Indicating with \(f\) a Higgs boson decay final state, the SM branching fraction is modified by the coefficient [9]:

\[\mu_{f}(\kappa_{\lambda},\kappa_{f})=\frac{{\rm BR}_{f}^{\rm BSM}}{{\rm BR}_{ f}^{SM}}=\frac{\kappa_{f}^{2}+(\kappa_{\lambda}-1)C_{1}^{f}}{\sum_{j}{\rm BR }_{j}^{\rm SM}\left[\kappa_{j}^{2}+(\kappa_{\lambda}-1)C_{1}^{j}\right]}\,. \tag{4}\]

where \(\sum_{j}\) runs over all the Higgs boson decay channels, \({\rm BR}_{j}^{\rm SM}\) is the Higgs boson SM decay rate to the \(j\) final state, \(\kappa_{j}\) is the branching fraction modifier for the \(j\) final state \(\left(\kappa_{j}^{2}={\rm BR}_{{\rm LO};j}^{\rm BSM}/{\rm BR}_{{\rm LO};j}^{ \rm SM}\right)\) that, as for the cross-section modifiers, is parametrised as function of \(\kappa_{F}\) and \(\kappa_{V}\), and \(C_{1}^{f}\) is the coefficient that provides the NLO EW dependence on \(\kappa_{\lambda}\). The values of \(C_{1}^{f}\) and the expressions of \(\kappa_{f}^{2}\) are reported in Table 4 for all theanalysed decay modes. For Higgs bosons decaying into two fermions, the \(C_{1}^{f}\) coefficient is zero. The model under discussion, as shown in Eq. 2 and Eq. 4, does not include any additional contributions from new physics to the total width of the Higgs boson, or in the \(gg\to H\) and \(H\to\gamma\gamma\) loop mediated processes.

The dependence on \(\kappa_{\lambda}\) of the Higgs boson production cross sections and the decay branching fractions are shown in Figure 2.

### Inclusion of event kinematic information

In the presence of a varied Higgs trilinear coupling, changes in \(\kappa_{\lambda}\) affect not only the inclusive rates of Higgs boson production and decay processes, but also their kinematics. In particular the largest deviations in kinematic distributions with respect to the to the SM are expected in the \(ZH\), \(WH\), and \(\bar{t}H\) production modes. On the contrary, in Higgs boson decay kinematics no significant modification are expected. Since the Higgs boson decays to two bodies in all decay channels, and it has a null spin, the angular distribution of the decay particles cannot be affected by BSM effects, being fully determined by the energy-momentum conservation and by the rotational symmetry of the decay. One exception is the decay to four fermions, that

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{c|c c c c c} \hline \hline decay mode & \(H\to\gamma\gamma\) & \(H\to WW^{*}\) & \(H\to ZZ^{*}\) & \(H\to b\bar{b}\) & \(H\to\tau\tau\) \\ \hline \(C_{1}^{f}\times 100\) & 0.49 & 0.73 & 0.82 & 0 & 0 \\ \hline \(\kappa_{f}^{2}\) & \(1.59\kappa_{V}^{2}+0.07\kappa_{F}^{2}-0.67\kappa_{V}\kappa_{F}\) & \(\kappa_{V}^{2}\) & \(\kappa_{V}^{2}\) & \(\kappa_{F}^{2}\) & \(\kappa_{F}^{2}\) \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}

is typically mediated by the \(WW^{*}\) and \(ZZ^{*}\) vector boson state. Also in this case, due to the extremely small coupling of the Higgs boson to electrons and muons, differential contributions from \(\kappa_{\lambda}\) are negligible [9].

The dependence of the \(\kappa_{\lambda}\) corrections on kinematics can be partially taken into account by exploiting cross-section measurements in regions defined by the STXS stage-1 framework. In this work, this has been done for the \(V\)BF, \(ZH\) and \(WH\) production modes, for which the STXS phase space region definitions are shown in Figure 3. The STXS region choice is not a priori optimized to constrain \(\kappa_{\lambda}\), but the granularity of the stage-1 configuration allows to apply the \(\kappa_{\lambda}\) model in smaller kinematic regions, with respect to the inclusive phase space. The advantage of a more differential description of the dependence on \(\kappa_{\lambda}\) is, on one hand, to reduce the potential bias on the determination of \(\kappa_{\lambda}\) introduced by the analysis efficiency and sensitivity being dependent on kinematics, and on the other hand, to exploit such kinematic dependence to further increase the sensitivity to \(\kappa_{\lambda}\).

For ggF production, differential \(\kappa_{\lambda}\) corrections are not yet available, because these involve higher order calculations including two loop corrections. Therefore STXS regions related to ggF share the same parametrization as for the inclusive ggF production. Since no differential measurement in terms of STXS regions is available in the input channels for the \(t\bar{t}H\) production mode, only the inclusive cross-section dependence on \(\kappa_{\lambda}\) has been considered in this case. The \(gg\to ZH\) cross-section is not parametrised as a function of \(\kappa_{\lambda}\), because the theoretical computation is still missing. Present data are not sensitive to this production mode; moreover, it should contribute mostly in high \(p_{\rm T}^{H}\) regions where the sensitivity to \(\kappa_{\lambda}\) is expected to be small. Finally, the \(b\bar{b}H\) and single top associated Higgs boson production modes are not parametrised as a function of \(\kappa_{\lambda}\). However, they contribute, together with the \(gg\to ZH\) production mode, to constrain \(\kappa_{F}\) and \(\kappa_{V}\), when these modifiers are fitted simultaneously with \(\kappa_{\lambda}\). On the contrary, their cross-sections are fixed to the SM value, when fitting \(\kappa_{\lambda}\) only.

The parametrization of the variation of the production cross-section as a function of \(\kappa_{\lambda}\) contained in Eq. 2, can be adapted to describe the cross-section in each single STXS region. This requires re-deriving the value of the kinematic dependent coefficients \(C_{1}^{i}\) in each region defined in the measurement. For each \(V\)BF, \(ZH\)

In the \(VH\), \(H\to b\bar{b}\) analysis, the separation in jet number of the \(p_{\rm T}^{V}\)[150, 250] region in the \(VH\) production mode has been ignored, merging the 0 and the \(\geq 1\) jet regions. The diagrams are obtained from Ref. [14].

\(WH\) region of the STXS stage-1 framework, the \(C_{1}^{i}\) coefficient has been computed using samples of events generated at LO EW using MadGraph5_aMC@NLO 2.5.5 [30], and reweighted on an event-by-event basis with the tool provided in Ref. [31]. This tool evaluates the self coupling dependent contribution of the NLO EW correction, selecting only the relevant one-loop diagrams that include trilinear Higgs boson vertices, but not self energy insertions. For each region \(i\) of the STXS framework, \(C_{1}^{i}\) is defined as the relative difference between the number of reweighted NLO events and LO events [9]. The \(C_{1}^{i}\) values are reported in Table 5. The total electroweak corrections represented by the coefficients \(K_{EW}^{i}\) and entering in Eq. 2 also depend on the event kinematics. However, in the regions of phase space where these corrections are most significant (typically for high Higgs boson transverse momentum), the sensitivity to the Higgs boson trilinear coupling is minimal [9]. For example for the \(WH\) and \(ZH\) production modes, \(K_{EW}^{i}\) variations of approximately 15% with respect to the inclusive value are expected only in high \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{H}\) regions, where the \(\kappa_{\lambda}\) sensitivity is suppressed (\(C_{1}^{i}\simeq 0\) in high \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{H}\) regions). For this reason, the coefficients \(K_{EW}^{i}\) can be assumed to be constant to a good approximation and set to their inclusive values that were already reported in Table 3.

Due to the variations of the kinematic distributions, the selection efficiency of the input analyses can also depend on \(\kappa_{\lambda}\). This effect has been tested using Monte Carlo samples, generated at LO with MadGraph5_aMC@NLO 2.5.5 and reweighted with a \(\lambda_{HHH}\)-dependent NLO EW correction for different values of \(\kappa_{\lambda}\). In general, a negligible dependence is found, except for the \(t\bar{t}H\) production, which is characterized by a stronger \(\kappa_{\lambda}\) kinematic dependence: the selection efficiency in the \(H\to\gamma\gamma\) analysis increases by 10% for \(\kappa_{\lambda}<-10\), but in this interval the reduction of the cross-section due to the \(\kappa_{\lambda}\)

\end{table}
Table 5: \(C_{1}^{i}\) coefficients for each region of the STXS scheme for the VBF, \(WH\) and \(ZH\) production modes. The same definition for STXS regions and production modes as in Table 2 is used. In the \(V\)BF categories, “VBF-cuts” [14] indicates selections applied to target the \(V\)BF di-jet topology, with requirements on the di-jet invariant mass (\(m_{jj}\)) and the difference in pseudorapidity between the two jets; the additional \(\leq 2j\) and \(\geq 3j\) region separation is performed indirectly by requesting \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{Hjj}\lesssim 25\) GeV. “\(VH\)-cuts” select the \(W,Z\to jj\) decays, requiring an \(m_{jj}\) value close to the vector boson mass [14]. The \(C_{1}^{i}\) coefficients of the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{V}>250\) GeV regions are negligible, O(\(10^{-6}\)), and are set to 0.

dependence is about 80% with respect to the nominal, therefore largely dominating over the efficiency variation. For this reason, the selection efficiencies can be reasonably assumed to be constant as a function of \(\kappa_{\lambda}\), and this assumption is made in the analysis presented here. However, this assumption will need to be re-evaluated also in the ggF production mode once a complete computation of the differential NLO EW corrections become available.

## 4 Statistical model

The statistical treatment used in this note follows the procedures described in Refs. [3; 4]. The result of the combination is obtained from a likelihood function \(L(\mathbf{\alpha},\mathbf{\theta})\), where \(\mathbf{\alpha}\) represents the vector of the parameters of interest (POI) of the model and \(\mathbf{\theta}\) is the set of nuisance parameters, which includes the systematic uncertainty contributions and background parameters that are constrained by side bands or control regions in data. The global likelihood function \(L(\mathbf{\alpha},\mathbf{\theta})\) is obtained as the product of the likelihoods of the input analyses. These are themselves products of likelihoods computed in the mutually orthogonal categories optimised in each analysis.

The number of signal events in each analysis category \(j\) is defined as:

\[n_{j}^{\rm signal}(\kappa_{\lambda},\kappa_{F},\kappa_{V},\mathbf{\theta})= \mathcal{L}_{j}(\mathbf{\theta})\sum_{i}\sum_{f}\mu_{if}(\kappa_{\lambda},\kappa_{ F},\kappa_{V})(\sigma_{\rm SM,\it i}(\mathbf{\theta})\times{\rm BR}_{\rm SM,\it f}( \mathbf{\theta}))(\epsilon\times A)_{if,j}(\mathbf{\theta})\,, \tag{5}\]

where the index \(i\) runs over all the production regions defined by the STXS stage-1 framework and the index \(f\) includes all the considered decay channels, _i.e._\(f=\gamma\gamma\), \(ZZ^{*}\), \(WW^{*}\), \(\tau\tau\), \(b\bar{b}\). \(\mathcal{L}_{j}\), is the integrated luminosity of the dataset used in the \(j\) category, and \((\epsilon\times A)_{if,j}\) represents the acceptance and efficiency estimation for the category \(j\), production process \(i\) and decay channel \(f\). All these terms depend also on a set of nuisance parameters \(\mathbf{\theta}\), that account for the theoretical and systematic uncertainties that can affect the luminosity, the cross-section and branching fraction prediction, the efficiency estimation, and the background estimation. For a complete discussion of these and other sources of systematic uncertainty please refer to the individual analysis papers referenced in Table 1. Finally, \(\mu_{if}(\kappa_{\lambda},\kappa_{F},\kappa_{V})=\mu_{i}(\kappa_{\lambda}, \kappa_{F},\kappa_{V})\times\mu_{f}(\kappa_{\lambda},\kappa_{F},\kappa_{V})\), where \(\mu_{i}\) is defined in Eq. 2 and \(\mu_{f}\) in Eq. 4, describes the yield dependence on the Higgs boson self-coupling modifier \(\kappa_{\lambda}\), and on the single Higgs boson coupling modifiers \(\kappa_{V}\) and \(\kappa_{F}\), representing potential deviations from the SM expectation.

Confidence intervals for the POIs are determined using the profile likelihood ratio [32] as test statistics:

\[\Lambda(\mathbf{\alpha})=\frac{L(\mathbf{\alpha},\hat{\mathbf{\theta}}(\mathbf{\alpha}))}{L( \hat{\mathbf{\alpha}},\hat{\mathbf{\theta}})}. \tag{6}\]

In the numerator the nuisance parameters are set to their _profiled_ values \(\hat{\mathbf{\theta}}(\mathbf{\alpha})\), that maximise the likelihood for a given set of values of \(\mathbf{\alpha}\). In the denominator both the parameters of interest and the nuisance parameters are respectively set to the values \(\hat{\mathbf{\alpha}}\) and \(\hat{\mathbf{\theta}}\), that simultaneously maximise the likelihood \(L(\mathbf{\alpha},\mathbf{\theta})\). In the asymptotic regime, \(-2\log\Lambda(\mathbf{\alpha},\mathbf{\theta})\) is approximately distributed as a \(\chi^{2}\) statistic with \(n\) degrees of freedom, where \(n\) equals the number of parameters of interests in the model. The results presented in this note are based on the profile-likelihood evaluation, and 68% as well as 95% C.L. intervals are given in the asymptotic approximation [32].

In some case the results in the note are presented with the uncertainty decomposed in separate contributions: theoretical uncertainties affecting the background processes, theoretical uncertainties affecting the Higgs boson signal, experimental uncertainties and statistical uncertainties. The values of the uncertainty components are derived by fixing the related nuisance parameters to their best value \(\hat{\theta}\) in the numerator and the denominator of \(\Lambda\). This procedure is repeated sequentially for each source of uncertainty following the same order in which they are listed above. The value of each component is then evaluated as the quadratic difference between the resulting uncertainty at each step and the uncertainty obtained in the previous one, where for the initial step the total uncertainty is considered. The statistical uncertainty is then evaluated at the last step, fixing all the nuisance parameters except to the ones that are only constrained by data, such as the data-driven background normalization.

## 5 Results

### Result of fits to \(\kappa_{\lambda}\)

In this section, the main result of this analysis is presented, where a likelihood fit is performed to constrain the value of the Higgs boson self-coupling \(\kappa_{\lambda}\), while leaving untouched all other Higgs boson couplings (\(\kappa_{V}=\kappa_{F}=1\)). A large variety of models beyond the SM exists where new physics is expected to only appear in a modification of the Higgs boson self-coupling, as for example the Higgs-boson portal models in the alignment limit [33]. In these BSM scenarios, the constraints on \(\kappa_{\lambda}\), derived through the combination of single-Higgs measurements, can be directly compared to the constraints set by double Higgs production measurements.

The \(\kappa_{\lambda}\) self-coupling modifier is probed in the range \(-20<\kappa_{\lambda}<20\), because outside this range the calculation in Ref. [8] loses its validity.

The value of \(-2\ln\Lambda(\kappa_{\lambda})\) as a function of \(\kappa_{\lambda}\) is shown in Figure 4 for the data and the Asimov dataset [32], generated from the likelihood distribution \(\Lambda\) with nuisance parameters fixed at the best fit value obtained on data and the parameter of interest fixed to SM hypothesis (_i.e._\(\kappa_{\lambda}=1\)). The central value and uncertainty of the \(\kappa_{\lambda}\) modifier of the trilinear Higgs boson self-coupling is determined to be:

\[\kappa_{\lambda}=4.0^{+4.3}_{-4.1}=4.0^{+3.7}_{-3.6}\,(\text{stat.})^{+1.6}_{- 1.5}\,(\text{exp.})^{+1.3}_{-0.9}\,(\text{sig.~{}th.})^{+0.8}_{-0.9}\,(\text{ bkg.~{}th.})\,,\]

where the total uncertainty is decomposed into components for statistical uncertainties, experimental systematic uncertainties, and theory uncertainties on signal and background modelling, following the procedure described in Section 4. The 95% C.L. interval of \(\kappa_{\lambda}\) is \(-3.2<\kappa_{\lambda}<11.9\) (observed) and \(-6.2<\kappa_{\lambda}<14.4\) (expected). This interval is comparable to the one obtained from the direct \(HH\) searches using an integrated luminosity of \(36.1\) fb\({}^{-1}\)[6], which is \(-5.0<\kappa_{\lambda}<12.1\) (observed) and \(-5.8<\kappa_{\lambda}<12.0\) (expected).

The difference in the shape of the likelihood curves in Figure 4 between the Asimov sample and the data is due to the non-linearity of the cross-section dependence from \(\kappa_{\lambda}\) and the difference of the best-fit values of \(\kappa_{\lambda}\) in the two cases. As shown by Figure 2, the sensitivity to \(\kappa_{\lambda}\) is not constant. The likelihood shape is affected by the different behaviour of the quadratic and linear \(\kappa_{\lambda}\) dependent terms: for example, if \(\kappa_{\lambda}\) is \(<1\) both terms induce a reduction of the Higgs boson production cross-sections, while for \(\kappa_{\lambda}>1\) there are larger cancellations that weaken the cross-section dependence on \(\kappa_{\lambda}\)[9]. Moreover, the global likelihood shape depends on combining the contributions from the different production and decay modes, which all have different sensitivities and in most cases also significantly different likelihood shapes, as shown in Figure 5. The dominant contributions to the \(\kappa_{\lambda}\) sensitivity derive from the di-boson decay channels \(\gamma\gamma\), \(ZZ^{*}\), \(WW^{*}\) and from the ggF and \(t\bar{t}H\) production modes.

The production mode that is most sensitive to the Higgs boson self-coupling is gluon fusion. In order to cross-check the effect on the results from assuming a kinematic independent parametrization of the gluon fusion production cross-section as a function of \(\kappa_{\lambda}\), an additional fit has been performed by excluding the STXS bins with Higgs boson transverse momentum above 120 GeV. This has been technically realized by introducing signal strength parameters for these STXS bins and profiling them independently in the fit. The result is a minimal change of the central value (\(\sim 5\%\)) and uncertainty on \(\kappa_{\lambda}\).

In addition, the impact on the \(\kappa_{\lambda}\) determination of using an inclusive cross-section measurement, rather than the differential cross-section information contained in the STXS bins, has been studied. An alternative fit has been performed where the \(V\)BF, \(VH\) and \(ZH\) production modes are considered as single inclusive bins. Compared to the use of differential information, the inclusive fit does not currently lead to a significant loss in sensitivity to \(\kappa_{\lambda}\). However, differential information should help most in the \(t\bar{t}H\) production mode, where it is currently not considered. All results are summarised in Table 6.

### Results of fits to \(\kappa_{\lambda}\) and either \(\kappa_{V}\) or \(\kappa_{F}\)

Two additional fit configurations are considered in this note, in which a simultaneous fit is performed to \(\kappa_{\lambda}\) and \(\kappa_{F}\), or to \(\kappa_{\lambda}\) and \(\kappa_{V}\). The remaining coupling modifier that is not included in the fit, \(\kappa_{V}\) in the first case and \(\kappa_{F}\) in the second case, is kept fixed to the SM prediction. These fits target BSM scenarios where new

The solid black line shows the profile likelihood distributions obtained including all systematic uncertainties (“Total”). Results from a statistic only fit “Stat. only” (black dashed line), including the experimental systematics “Stat. + Exp. Sys.” (blue solid line), adding theory systematics related to the signal “Stat.+ Exp. Sys.+ Sig. Th. Sys.” (red solid line) are also shown. The dotted horizontal lines show the \(-2\ln\Lambda(\kappa_{\lambda})=1\) and \(-2\ln\Lambda(\kappa_{\lambda})=4\) levels that are used to define the \(\pm 1\sigma\) and \(\pm 2\sigma\) uncertainties on \(\kappa_{\lambda}\).

physics could affect only the Yukawa type terms (\(\kappa_{V}\) = 1) of the SM or only the couplings to vector bosons (\(\kappa_{F}\) = 1), in addition to the Higgs boson self-coupling (\(\kappa_{\lambda}\) ) [34].

The theory parametrization used in this study in terms of cross section dependence on \(\kappa_{\lambda}\) and \(\kappa_{V}\) or \(\kappa_{F}\) assumes partial factorization of the changes to the cross section induced by the single-Higgs coupling modifiers \(\kappa_{V}\), \(\kappa_{F}\), and those induced by the self-coupling modifier \(\kappa_{\lambda}\). While this assumption is not justified in the presence of large deviations from the SM expectations, it also reflects the fact that NLO EW correction are not theoretically well defined after introducing LO-motivated single-Higgs coupling modifiers. While a more complete theoretical framework (such as an Effective Field Theory approach) is needed to overcome these difficulties, the results presented in this section give a rough indication of the simultaneous sensitivity to both Higgs boson self-coupling and single Higgs boson couplings with the data statistics currently available for the input analyses. The results are summarised in Table 6.

Figure 6 shows negative log-likelihood contours on the \((\kappa_{\lambda},\kappa_{F})\) and \((\kappa_{\lambda},\kappa_{V})\) grids obtained from fits performed in the \(\kappa_{V}\ =1\) or \(\kappa_{F}=1\) hypothesis, respectively. As expected, including additional degrees of freedom to the fit reduces the constraining power of the measurement. In particular, the sensitivity to \(\kappa_{\lambda}\) is not much degraded when determining \(\kappa_{F}\) at the same time, while it is degraded by 50% (on the expected lower 95% C.L. exclusion limit) when determining simultaneously \(\kappa_{V}\) and \(\kappa_{\lambda}\). An even less constrained fit, performed by either fitting simultaneously \(\kappa_{\lambda}\), \(\kappa_{V}\) and \(\kappa_{F}\), or fitting simultaneously \(\kappa_{\lambda}\) and a common single Higgs boson coupling modifier (\(\kappa=\kappa_{V}=\kappa_{F}\)), results in nearly no sensitivity to \(\kappa_{\lambda}\) within the theoretically allowed range of \(|\kappa_{\lambda}|<20\).

Figure 5: Profile likelihood scan, in terms of \(-2\ln\Lambda(\kappa_{\lambda})\), performed as a function of \(\kappa_{\lambda}\) on Asimov datasets [32] generated under the SM hypothesis for each Higgs boson production mode (a) and each decay channel (b). In (a) the scan is performed parametrising all branching fractions and the selected production mode cross-section as a function of \(\kappa_{\lambda}\), while fixing the cross-section of the other production modes at the SM value, in (b) all production mode cross-sections and decay branching fractions are expressed as a function of \(\kappa_{\lambda}\), but only the categories of the selected channel are included in the fit. The \(t\bar{t}H\) multi-lepton categories are excluded from the \(H\to ZZ^{*}\), \(H\to WW^{*}\), and \(H\to\tau\tau\) fits.

## 6 Conclusion

The Higgs boson self-coupling modifier \(\kappa_{\lambda}=\lambda_{HHH}/\lambda_{HHH}^{SM}\) has been extracted with a global fit procedure [8; 9] applied to the combination of analyses targeting the single Higgs production modes on data collected at \(\sqrt{s}=13\) TeV up to an integrated luminosity of up to 80 fb\({}^{-1}\)[4]. In the simplified assumption that all deviations from the SM expectation have to be interpreted as a modification of the trilinear coupling of the Higgs boson, the best fit value of \(\kappa_{\lambda}\) is \(\kappa_{\lambda}=4.0^{+4.3}_{-4.1}\), excluding at the 95% C.L. values outside the interval \(-3.2<\kappa_{\lambda}<11.9\). Additional results, including the simultaneous determination of the Higgs boson self-coupling and single Higgs boson couplings to either fermions or bosons, have also been derived.

This analysis shows that an alternative and complementary approach to constrain the Higgs boson self-coupling through direct double Higgs production searches is feasible. This approach can provide sensitivity that is not far from to the more direct determination of the Higgs boson self-coupling through double Higgs production. However, the constraints become significantly weaker in new physics scenarios where simultaneous modifications to the single Higgs boson couplings are allowed, to the point of almost vanishing when a single overall Higgs coupling rescaling modifier is considered. The differential information currently provided by the STXS regions in the \(V\)BF, \(WH\) and \(ZH\) production modes does not help to remove such degeneracies nor to improve the sensitivity to \(\kappa_{\lambda}\) significantly. Nevertheless, a dedicated optimization of the kinematic binning, including the most sensitive ggF and \(t\bar{t}H\) production modes, still needs to be fully theoretically and experimentally explored and might improve the sensitivity in the future.

The best fit value is indicated by a cross while the SM hypothesis is indicated by a star. The plot assumes that the approximations in Refs. [8; 9] are valid inside the shown contours.

Table 6: Best fit values for \(\kappa\) modifiers with \(\pm 1\sigma\) uncertainties. The first column shows the parameter(s) of interest in each fit configuration, where the other coupling modifiers are kept fixed to the SM prediction. The fit to determine \(\kappa_{\lambda}\) has been performed in two configurations, one using the full STXS granularity for \(V\)BF, \(ZH\) and \(WH\) (STXS), and the other only considering the inclusive parametrization for all the production modes (inclusive). The 95% C.L. interval for \(\kappa_{\lambda}\) is also reported. For each fit result the upper row corresponds to the observed results, and the lower row to the expected results obtained using Asimov datasets generated under the SM hypothesis [32]. The \(\kappa_{\lambda}\), \(\kappa_{V}\) and \(\kappa_{\lambda}\), \(\kappa_{F}\) fit results are obtained under the assumption that the approximations in Refs. [8, 9] are valid in 95% C.L. regions.
