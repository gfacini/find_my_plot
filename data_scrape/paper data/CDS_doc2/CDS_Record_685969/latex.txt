Experimental set-up

A detailed description of the ASDBLR design is given in [1]. Here only the results of the studies of the basic ASDBLR operational properties are described.

Two specially designed printed circuit boards containing 2 ASDBLR chips each have been prepared at Penn. The discriminator outputs for all 32 channels were available through standard dual row output connectors and total of four channels of analog monitor information was provided for to examine the signal before and after the baseline restorer (BLR). A proper ground connection of these boards with input devices (current injector or straws) where completely enough to suppress practically any oscillations and pick-up noise.

**NO special shielding for the chips or the boards was necessary**. This shows that ASDBLR chip and the board design technique is quite suitable. The parasitic capacity of the inputs of the mounted ASDBLR chip is about 7.5 pF per channel. The connection of the ASDBLR inputs to external devices was made using standard cable of 5 cm length with LEMO connector.

The signal injector translates the standard shape signal from a pulser into the current signal similar to that from the straw (for \({}^{55}\)Fe-source). All studies with the straws have been done with the 30 \(\mu\)m wire and a gas mixture of 70%Xe+20%CF+10%CO2. The gas gain is nominal for most of the measurements - 2.5-10\({}^{4}\). To get signals from the straw with smaller amplitudes the gas gain was proportionally reduced.

## 2 Analog signals after shaper and base line restorer

### Signal shape after shaper

A signal after shaper for 3.5 keV input signal is shown in Fig. 1. One can see that it is quite slow and has a peaking time of about 15 ns and a rear edge of 60 ns. It is specially done to get the best signal shape after the base line restorer. Ion tail residual after pole/zero cancellation network is shown in Fig. 2. The long term part of the signal has the amplitude which is only 0.5% of the fast signal amplitude.

### Signal shape after the base line restorer

The base line restorer practically eliminates the residual ion tail, Fig. 3.

A comparison of the fast component of the signals before and after base line restorer is shown in Fig. 4 (the signal after the base line restorer has a lobe of opposite polarity). In Fig. 5 few samples of the output signals after BLR are shown (0.5 keV, 1 keV end 4 keV). As it is expected the overshoot value strongly depends on signal amplitude. Fig. 6 shows the overshoot area as a part of the signal area as a function of the signal amplitude.

Fig.4 Fast component of the signal before and after base line restoration Fig.5 Samples of the signals after base line restorer for point ionisation

Top - 0.5 keV; Middle - 1.0 keV; Bottom - 4 keVOne can see that for the signal amplitude, which corresponds to 2 keV energy deposition, the overshoot area is about 30% of the signal area. It becomes even 51% and more if the signal amplitude less than 1 keV. Fig. 7 shows peaking time and full width on the base as a function of the signal amplitude. The effects of this overshoot are discussed in section concerning to ASDBLR performance at high counting rate. The peaking time is very close to the specified value (8-10 ns). The same is related to the signal width at the base (specified value is 20 ns)

A comparison of the signal shape and amplitudes for 4 available channels did not show any difference for the same input current.

### ASDBLR performance with 80 cm straw

ASDBLR analog output signals for different source positions for the 80 cm straw are shown in Fig. 8,9,10 (for 6 keV, 2 keV and 1 keV corespondly). For the signals with large amplitudes (such as 6 keV) the amplitude uniformity along the straw is about 9%. For 2 keV signals it is 13%. The signal width at the base is 28-30 ns for 6 keV and 23-25 ns for 2 keV.

These photos give important information about ASDBLR matching to the straw. The ASDBLR chip has a frequency dependent input impedance, Fig 11. If the termination is not perfect some reflections should be observed.

They are clearly seen at the source position of 75 cm, but they are not large and do not course any oscillation problem.

Top - 5 cm; Middle - 45 cm; Bottom - 75 cmFig.11 ASDBLR measured input impedance as a function of frequency In order to examine ASDBLR response for minimum ionising particles, the 80 cm straw was irradiated by \(\beta\)-source at the middle and the averaged pictures were taken for two cases: trigger from the straw signal (Fig. 12) and trigger from the scintillation counter placed behind of the straw (Fig. 13). The accumulated charge as a function of time also shown in these figures. One can see that for the scintillator trigger the overshoot area is about 27% of the signal area what is practically the same as for 2 keV signal from X-ray source.

### Response for the streamer

Fig. 14 shows the signal on the BLR and the discriminator outputs for the self limited streamer discharge. It takes of about 600 ns to return to base line. This time the chip is practically dead for drift time measurements (see discriminator signal).

### Recovery time

In case of the signals coming close to each other it takes a time to return to base line. This time (recovery time) is different for different types of the electronics. Fig. 15 shows the recovery time for ASDBLR chip. One can see that it takes of 100 ns to return to the base line after some number of pulses going together.

### High rate operation

High rate tests have been carried out with the same straw matrix which was used for high rate RUN in 1995. This matrix was specially made to represent 80 cm straw with the capacity close to that for this straw. Fig. 16 shows the signal from the matrix for \({}^{55}Fe\) with a reduced gas gain by factor 3 (this means for 2 keV energy deposition). The overshoot area is about of 28% of the signal area (as for 80 cm straw irradiated by minimum ionising particles). The integral of the. signal is also shown in this photo.

Photos in Fig. 17 (shaper output) and 18 (BLR output) show high rate operation of the ASDBLR chip at 25 MHz counting rate. One can clearly see an overlapping of the signals after shaper, but BLR keeps the base line quite solid. Fig. 19 gives more details about operation of the BLR network at high counting rate. There are 30 pulses in 1 \(\mu\)s in this photo. Due to the overshoots and recovery phenomena the effective threshold level is shifted quite large (up to bf 400 eV and more, depends on the number of pulses which appeared before and the distance between them) what will lead to the deterioration of the drift time accuracy and the hit registration efficiency (see next section).

**No unexpected chip behavior has been found at the moment of the start and the end of the pulse bunch.**

### Discriminator response

Two samples of the discriminator output signals for 1 keV (top) and 6 keV (bottom) input signals are shown in Fig. 20 (High Level Threshold is above 6 keV). The discriminator signal has a proper shape and its width follows to the input signal width (20 ns for 1 keV and 28 ns for 6 keV at the threshold of 200 eV). The rise time is about 1.5 ns. The same is for back edge of the pulse.**NO unstable behavior of the discriminators has been observed.** Fig. 21 demonstrates the start of the high level threshold operation at 4 keV input signal. Normally it appears at the end of the low level threshold signal and goes forward when the high level threshold is lowered down, Fig.22. In this picture the high level threshold is close to the low level. In that case the total width of the signal from the discriminator is increased.

### Calibration and dynamic range

All 32 channels of 4 ASDBLR chips were calibrated using current injector, which has the current shape close to that from the straw. At the given amplitude of the injected signal the threshold on the chip is set such a way to get 50% registration efficiency of the pulser signal. In the experimental setups the threshold is measured as a voltage on the current setting resistor (3.92 kOhm). The input signal is measured in an energy scale for the gas gain of \(2.5\cdot 10^{4}\). Fig. 23 shows the signal-threshold (low level) relation (or threshold calibration curve) for one ASDBLR channel. This dependance is linear up to the input amplitude values of about 200 eV. At amplitudes less than 200 eV it becomes slightly nonlinear, but that is already quite close to the noise level. Calibration curves of 16 channels of one board are shown in Fig. 24.

In Fig. 25 the regions of the threshold calibration curves for all channels and all chips are shown. Calibration curves are very close to each other not only for one chip, but for all of the chips as well. If the threshold level is set at **200 eV** for all the channels the total threshold spread will be of \(\pm\)**20 eV**, what is very positive and encouraging result.

Calibration curves for High Level Threshold for 16 channels are shown in Fig.26. The threshold - amplitude relation is linear up to 24 keV of the input signal and the limit of the dinamic range is close to 30 keV. This is very close to that what was designed.

### Noise level

The noise level of the ASDBLR chip has been studied using only discriminator output information. It was done because the ASDBLR response is non linear near the expected operational threshold. The most important characteristics of the chip for us is the noise counting rate at the definite threshold. At the threshold of about 240 eV the counting rate for one of the channel

Fig.27: ASDBLR noise counting rate as a function of threshold. Tested channel connected to the straw

is **1 Hz**, if nothing connected to the testing board (intrinsic noise of the chip + noise from a 7.5 pF parasitic capacitance). 5 cm cable with LEMO connector increase the counting rate up to **28 Hz**. Connection with the short straw which was placed into a metallic box gives the noise counting rate of **500 Hz**. All pick-up and oscillations were practically eliminated for the noisemeasurements. Fig. 27 shows the noise counting rate as a function of threshold for one channel connected to the straw (short straw in metallic box). All channels have the same behavior if the absolute threshold (in eV) is set accurately. Noise counting rate for this electronics at the threshold of **200 eV is about 12 kHz**. It becomes more than \(10^{5}\) at the threshold of **150 eV**. These results are in a good agreement with the predicted ones, Fig. 28, where the comparison of the noise level for TRDA and ASDBLR is done [2].

### High counting rate properties.

Comparison with St.Petersburg electronics

In order to understand behavior of the ASDBLR chip at high counting rate the comparison of its performance with the that of the St.Petersburg electronics, which has a peaking time of 8 ns and full width at the base of 20 ns, has been done.

#### 3.4.1 ASDBLR and St.Pet. electronics response for minimum ionising particles

Averaged discriminator signals from \(\beta\)-particles (trigger from the straw) for both types of the electronics are shown in Fig. 29. The same signals but for the trigger from scintillator placed behind of the straw are shown in Fig. 30. Thesedistributions are very close to each other (full width on the base and FWHM). This means that operational properties of two types of the electronics should be the same if there is no problem related to the pulse tails. The overshoot added by the BLR can lead to deterioration of the drift time measurement at high rate as new signals become more likely to pile up in the tails of signals from prteceding ionizations. In order to check it the same test as for TRDA-chip has been done [3].

#### 3.4.2 Leading edge measurements with ASDBLR and St.Pet. electronics

On the amplifier input connected to the straw matrix the test pulse from pulser through capacity of 1 pF was sent. The digital scope was externally synchronized with this pulse and averaged test pulse signal (from discriminator output) has been recorded. Normally, each start of the scope contains the signal from the pulser and averaged signal looks like it is shown in Fig. 31 (the input pulse signal amplitude is equal to 350 eV point ionization). If the same picture is accumulated at the presence of the background, the background signals from time to time will overlap the signals from the pulse and then these signals will be lost from the leading edge measurements or their position will be changed. So from this test we can extract information about hit efficiency registration. The leading edge of the averaged discriminator signal will indicate of the possible deterioration of the drift time measurement accuracy. Fig. 32 shows the same picture as in Fig. 31, but at the presence of the background (counting rate of 20 MHz). The ratio of the signal amplitudes in two pictures gives leading edge efficiency registration which is about 28%. The deterioration of the timing also clearly seen from these pictures. The front of the averaged signal which shows the total spread of the measured time is changed from 2.8 ns to 7.2 ns. It is hard to translate this data to the straw drift time measurement accuracy, but what we can do that is compare them with the same measurements for St.Pet. electronics, performance of which we know very well. Figs. 33 and 34 show the same data as Figs. 31 and 32, but for St.Petersbug electronics. One can see that in this case the hit registration efficiency is about 50% and leading edge width is changed from about 2 ns to 4.6 ns. These numbers depend on the test pulse amplitude.

Figs. 35 and 36 show the hit registration efficiency and leading edge spread as a function of counting rate for test pulse amplitudes of 350 eV for the both types of the electronics. The same data but for 1.1 keV input signals are shown in Figs. 37 and 38. From last figures one can conclude that the hit registration efficiency for 1.1 keV is very close for both types of the electronics, but leading edge spread is still quite different.

The difference in the electronics performances is explained by the different overshoot behavior. Larger overshoot for the ASDBLR-chip makes it less effective to the low level signals in comparison with St.Petersburg electronics.

**To reach the aimed performance of the ASDBLR chip two modifications can be done:**

* The gain of the shaping stage can be increased by factor of 2. In that case the relative overshoot area for 2 keV signals will be close to that of the St.Petersburg electronics.
* At the same time decay time constant for shaping should be a little bit decreased to provide the same signal width at a new gain (output signal shape of the ASDBLR depends on signal amplitude, Sec. 2.3)

With these two modifications the ASDBLR performance will be the close to the St.Petersburg electronics performance, taken as a base line. For full happiness, if it is nothing cost, one more not principal improvement would be useful to do for ASDBLR - to make a shaping a little bit faster: signal peaking time of 8 ns and width on the base of 20 ns for 2 keV signal amplitude. At present time we have this parameters by 2 ns more.

## 4 Conclusions

A summary of the ASDBLR - chip properties is given in Table 1. This chip exibits stable, low noise performance and is presently close to meeting the specifications anticipated for the TRT. Minor revisions of the present design, recomended above, are expected to result in improved peformance, suitable for a final design.
