###### Abstract

Double Higgs production is currently not fully implemented in PYTHIA, as only the resonant \(H\to hh\) MSSM processes and \(f_{i}\bar{f}_{i}\) production modes can be generated. Using matrix elements from the HPAIR program we have added in PYTHIA the gluon fusion production modes in SM and MSSM. These matrix elements include resonant processes as well as continuum production, which is relevant for SM and MSSM high \(\tan\beta\) scenarios. Comparison between PYTHIA Monte Carlo results and VEGAS integrated cross sections is shown.

Introduction

Scalar Higgs boson pair production at LHC allows to study the trilinear Higgs self couplings in the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) scheme. In \(pp\) collisions the dominating process is the gluon fusion \(gg\to HH\), where \(H\) can be any of the MSSM neutral Higgs particles. In PYTHIA neutral Higgs pairs can be generated through the resonance channel \(H\to hh\) or via \(f_{i}\bar{f}_{i}\to AH,Ah\). For Standard Model (SM) and MSSM scenarios with high values of \(\tan\beta\) the contribution of \(s\)-channel processes becomes negligible, thus PYTHIA alone can not be used to explore this region of the parameter space where the cross section can rise above 1 pb for values of \(m_{A}\) up to 150 GeV.

At LHC the measurement of the trilinear self couplings in the production modes dominated by the gluon fusion would require a huge amount of data. Nonetheless the MSSM high \(\tan\beta\) value cases are interesting as a discovery channel, since their cross section is large enough.

This note presents the complete implementation of leading order (LO) matrix elements, calculated with HPAIR1[5], into PYTHIA 6.203[1]. This implementation allows a more complete simulation of \(hh\) production in the resonance region and of all neutral Higgs pairs in continuum.

Footnote 1: HPAIR is a program written by M. Spira from Paul Scherrer Institute, Villigen Switzerland

After a brief description of the implementation procedure, we will present a comparison between cross section values obtained with the PYTHIA Monte Carlo generated for different MSSM scenarios, and those computed with the VEGAS program [2]. For the SM case, specific implementations as well as a complete study using this PYTHIA modified version, have been done by F. Mazzucato et al.[3].

## 2 Neutral Higgs pair production implementation in PYTHIA

### Neutral Higgs pair production processes

The following table shows the processes which are already implemented into PYTHIA 6.2.

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|} \hline In & No. & Subprocess \\ \hline + & 299 & \(f_{i}\bar{f}_{i}\to Ah^{0}\) \\ + & 300 & \(f_{i}\bar{f}_{i}\to AH^{0}\) \\ \hline \end{tabular}

Although these processes are dominant in most of the MSSM scenarios, they contribute for only 10% of the total cross section when \(\tan\beta\) is above 30. For \(\tan\beta=30\) the dominant process is \(gg\to AA\) and all other processes contribute for 50% of the total cross section, as can be seen on figure 1.

Thus for a more complete study of the possible MSSM scenarios we have added into PYTHIA, the processes listed in the following table.

### Implementation overview

All subprocesses (303 to 308) listed above were implemented in a private version of PYTHIA, as standard \(2\to 2\) PYTHIA processes. We choose not to use the PYUPEV scheme, but we tried to keep the modifications into PYTHIA to the minimum. The following routines have been modified or included to take into account the new processes:

* **PYDATA** to setup processes data.
* **PYSIGH** to compute differential cross sections.

Figure 1: _Neutral Higgs pair LO cross sections as a function of \(m_{A}\) in maximal mixing, using HPAIR. For \(\tan\beta=30\) (left plot) and for \(\tan\beta=10\) (right plot). Below the transition limit, the cross section is dominated by \(AA\), \(Ah\) and \(hh\) production, while above \(AA\), \(AH\) and \(HH\) dominate. At the transition region \(A\), \(H\) and \(h\) have all very similar masses and all possible Higgs pairs can be produced. For this particular case, different Higgs can not be disentangled since they have similar masses and branching ratios._

integrated values of each term in the allowed range. The \(c_{i}\) factors are weights for each term normalized for every distribution and are optimized during PYTHIA initialization.

The implemented processes for which a resonance production is possible are the following:

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|} \hline No. & Subprocess & Possible resonance \\ \hline
303 & \(gg\to h^{0}h^{0}\) & \(H^{0}\) \\
306 & \(gg\to Ah^{0}\) & \(Z^{0}\) \\
307 & \(gg\to AH^{0}\) & \(Z^{0}\) \\
308 & \(gg\to AA\) & \(H^{0}\) \\ \hline \end{tabular}

Note that, the reactions \(Z\to AH\), \(Z\to Ah\) and \(H\to AA\) are not CP allowed. So in these cases, the resonance production is very unlikely to appear.

### Differential cross section computation

The HPAIR routines provide the differential cross section as function of the Mandelstam variables \(\hat{s}\), \(\hat{t}\) and \(\hat{u}\) which are derived from the generated \(\tau\), \(y\) and \(z\) values. These routines use the formula[5]:

\[\frac{\mathrm{d}\hat{\sigma}}{\mathrm{d}t}=[\frac{1}{2}]\frac{2\alpha_{S}^{2} }{(4\pi)^{2}}\frac{1}{256\cdot 16\pi\hat{s}^{2}}\mathcal{M}^{2}\]

where \(\mathcal{M}\) is the matrix element, and the \(1/2\) factor is only present if we have two identical particles in the final state, that is \(AA\), \(HH\) or \(hh\).

### Treatment of the off-shell bosons

In SM and MSSM large \(\tan\beta\) scenarios, the Higgs width might be non negligible and Higgs particles might be produced off-shell. This case must be taken into account in order to reproduce correctly the kinematics of the events,

When the Higgs width is not negligible (\(\geq 0.020\) GeV), like for the other kinematical variables, PYTHIA can generate the Higgs mass along a \(f(m^{2})\) distribution taking account the resonance. This generation is controlled by \(MSTP(42)=1\). The \(f(m^{2})\) distribution is made of 3 terms, with the first one being a Breit-Wigner. Each term is weighted with a fixed coefficient. This coefficient is 80% for the first term. The Breit-Wigner does well reproduce the shape of the resonance when substituting the width \(\Gamma\) with \(m^{*}\Gamma^{*}/m_{R}\) in its formula. \(\Gamma^{*}\) being the Higgs width at the generated mass \(m^{*}\) scale. For each event, the cross section is then weighted with a factor \(B_{H}^{*}/B_{H}\) defined as follow:

\[B_{H}^{*}=\frac{m_{H}\Gamma_{H}^{*}}{(m_{H}^{*2}-m_{H}^{2})^{2}+m_{H}^{*2} \Gamma_{H}^{*2}}\]

and

\[B_{H}=\frac{m_{H}\Gamma_{H}}{(m_{H}^{*2}-m_{H}^{2})^{2}+m_{H}^{2}\Gamma_{H}^{ 2}}\]where \(H\) can be any of \(A\), \(H\) and \(h\), and '\(*\)' denotes the off-shell bosons. The total cross section weight factor is then:

\[B_{H_{1}}^{*}/B_{H_{1}}\cdot B_{H_{2}}^{*}/B_{H_{1}}\cdot\frac{m_{H_{1}^{*}}m_{H_ {2}^{*}}}{m_{H}^{2}}\]

where \(i=1,2\) denotes the two final states Higgs bosons.

In this case, the generation of events is much slower and can lead to very high and unphysical differential cross sections. Thus, except for the study of the event kinematics, one should rely on on-shell bosons production.

### Event generation and total cross section

Each Monte Carlo event is weighted using the differential cross section and kinematical variables. In this way, the total cross section is obtained from all the generated events, with (see PYTHIA manual [1], page 92):

\[\sigma=\left\langle\frac{\pi}{s}\frac{\beta_{34}}{\tau^{2}h_{\tau}(\tau)h_{y }(y)2h_{z}(z)}x_{1}f_{1}(x_{1},Q^{2})x_{2}f_{2}(x_{2},Q^{2})\frac{\hat{\sigma} ^{2}}{\pi}\frac{\mathrm{d}\hat{\sigma}}{\mathrm{d}t}\right\rangle\]

where the \(f_{i}\) are the structure functions and the \(x_{i}\) denote the fraction of energy carried by the incoming partons.

### User instructions

The new processes were implemented in PYTHIA 6.2. Since they include also the resonance production, process 152 should be turned off to avoid double counting.

The PYTHIA MSSM parameters \(\tan\beta\) and \(m_{A}\) can be set respectively with RMSS(5) and RMSS(19). Another useful PYTHIA parameter is MSTP(42), which allows to turn on or off the off-shell boson generation.

## 3 Cross section results

### Cross sections for different MSSM scenarios

Studies were made using three different scenarios, maximal, typical and minimal mixing. They were defined as:

* Maximal mixing: \(A_{U}=A_{D}=2450\) TeV and \(\mu=200\) TeV
* Typical mixing: \(A_{U}=A_{D}=1000\) TeV and \(\mu=-1000\) TeV
* Minimal mixing: \(A_{U}=A_{D}=\mu=0\)

All cross sections were computed using the CTEQ5L structure functions, otherwise specified.

As can be seen on figure 2, the main difference between maximal and typical mixing comes from the fact that the transition region is much narrower for typical mixing. Below the transition region \(A\) and \(h\) are degenerated, while above that region, \(A\) and \(H\) are degenerated. At large \(\tan\beta\) Higgs masses can get very close, making it almost impossible to differentiate between \(A\) and \(H\) or \(h\). In the transition region, \(A\), \(H\) and \(h\) all have almost the same mass and would be seen as the same object in accelerators such as the LHC.

Note that, while all different processes may behave very differently when changing MSSM parameters, the overall total cross section shape is more predictable, as shown on figure 3.

### Comparison between Monte Carlo and integrated results

The standalone HPAIR program uses VEGAS to integrate the total cross section of Higgs pair production processes. The program allows also to compute the NLO contribution with QCD corrections, which are valid for \(m_{A}\) up to 200 GeV. Figure 4 shows respectively LO and NLO cross sections obtained with HPAIR and VEGAS as a function of \(m_{A}\) for different values of \(\tan\beta\) in the typical mixing. One can see that the NLO cross sections are a factor 1.5 above LO cross sections.

As a check, one can compare cross section obtained using PYTHIA and VEGAS with the same matrix elements. Figures 5 and 6 show some results obtained with 1000 VEGAS iterations and 100 PYTHIA events per bin. Unfortunately, the stand alone HPAIR code and PYTHIA have some small differences in the algorithms which implement the running of \(\alpha_{S}\) and the Higgs mass spectrum. For this reason, the cross cross section using the two codes might be slightly different. This is especially true when the cross section is very sensitive on the \(H\) and \(h\) mass difference like for the resonance \(gg\to H\to hh\) process at low \(\tan\beta\). However for the SM case, where the Higgs mass is fixed, using the same algorithm for the running of \(\alpha_{S}\) gives a good agreement between PYTHIA and HPAIR. This is also the case for MSSM scenarios when we use the same algorithms for the running of \(\alpha_{S}\) and the Higgs mass spectrum.

### Monte Carlo efficiency

To ensure that the kinematic variable distributions used in the Monte-Carlo do well reproduce the real ones, we compared the number of generated events with the number of tried events. With PYTHIA using the existing process ISUB=152 to generate \(gg\to H\to hh\) we obtain, for maximal mixing scenario, the following numbers:

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|} \hline \(\tan\beta\) & \(m_{A}\) & \(m_{h}\) & \(\Gamma_{h}\) & \(\sigma\) & Number of & Number of \\  & (GeV) & (GeV) & & (pb) & generated events & tried events \\ \hline
3 & 300 & 110.8 & 4.5 MeV & 0.57 & 10000 & 26027 \\ \hline
5 & 300 & 118.4 & 5.2 MeV & 0.17 & 10000 & 25451 \\ \hline
10 & 300 & 122.3 & 5.5 MeV & 0.019 & 10000 & 27346 \\ \hline
20 & 300 & 123.3 & 5.6 MeV & 0.0031 & 10000 & 35363 \\ \hline \end{tabular}

Figure 2: _Neutral Higgs pair LO cross sections as a function of \(m_{A}\) for \(\tan\beta=50\), obtained using HPAIR. For maximal mixing (left plot) and typical mixing (right plot). For the typical mixing scenario, the transition region is much narrower than in maximal or minimal mixing cases._

Using the process ISUB=152, only the resonance production is simulated and thus, the cross section is lower than the total cross section obtained with HPAIR matrix elements. With our implementation of HPAIR matrix elements in PYTHIA we obtain, for MSSM maximal mixing scenario and SM, the following total \(gg\to hh\) cross sections:

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|} \hline \(\tan\beta\) & \(m_{A}\) & \(m_{h}\) & \(\Gamma_{h}\) & \(\sigma\) & Number of & Number of \\  & (GeV) & (GeV) & & (pb) & generated events & tried events \\ \hline
3 & 300 & 110.8 & 4.5 MeV & 0.60 & 10000 & 53567 \\ \hline
5 & 300 & 118.4 & 5.2 MeV & 0.19 & 10000 & 53531 \\ \hline
10 & 300 & 122.3 & 5.5 MeV & 0.048 & 10000 & 62464 \\ \hline
20 & 300 & 123.3 & 5.6 MeV & 0.022 & 10000 & 101631 \\ \hline \hline
30 & 110 & 109.1 & 2.4 GeV & 0.32 & 10000 & 47454 \\ \hline
40 & 110 & 109.1 & 4.4 GeV & 1.05 & 10000 & 46833 \\ \hline
50 & 110 & 108.9 & 6.9 GeV & 2.62 & 10000 & 47394 \\ \hline \hline SM & - & 115.0 & 3.3 MeV & 0.021 & 10000 & 97743 \\ \hline SM & - & 300.0 & 8.4 GeV & 0.0013 & 10000 & 50972 \\ \hline \end{tabular}

Our implementation is about twice less efficient, but, as we are comparing a \(2\to 2\) with a \(2\to 1\) process, this is still acceptable. However, when the light Higgs width increases, the corresponding Higgs mass should be generated with a Breit-Wigner shape to correctly reproduce the kinematics of the events.

In this case, where the final state Higgs bosons are generated off-shell, the Monte-Carlo efficiency is greatly reduced:

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|} \hline \(\tan\beta\) & \(m_{A}\) & \(m_{h}\) & \(\Gamma_{h}\) & \(\sigma\) & Number of & Number of & Warnings \\  & & (GeV) & & (pb) & generated events & tried events & \\ \hline
30 & 110 & 109.1 & 2.4 GeV & 0.31 & 10000 & 151129 & 0 \\ \hline
40 & 110 & 109.1 & 4.4 GeV & 1.00 & 10000 & 150090 & 2 \\ \hline
50 & 110 & 108.9 & 6.9 GeV & 2.50 & 10000 & 148759 & 3 \\ \hline \hline SM & - & 300.0 & 8.4 GeV & 0.0014 & 10000 & 155741 & 8 \\ \hline \end{tabular}

The last row of the table gives the number of advisory warning due to a maximum violation in the computed differential cross section. This number gets higher when the Higgs width increases. Maximum violation should only occurs when off-shell bosons production is selected, as PYTHIA always search for the maximum of the differential cross section using on-shell particles. One should then, take care that the maximum increases only by a

small amount. Otherwise, one should set the PYTHIA parameter MSTP(123)=1, so that the maximum will not be increased.

Although, the HPAIR matrix elements can be used to compute off-shell bosons differential cross sections, one should rather trust cross sections obtained with on-shell bosons for Higgs pair production. But off-shell bosons events are still very interesting for kinematics studies.

### Kinematic distributions

Kinematic distributions have been studied for the 4 \(b\) final state, that is when both Higgs disintegrate to \(b\bar{b}\). The most important one for this final state is the \(p_{T}\) distribution of the \(b\), as current selection algorithms ask for \(b\) with a \(p_{T}\) above 40 GeV. In addition, as there is no \(b\)-trigger in ATLAS, higher \(p_{T}\) jets will be more likely to pass the jet trigger thresholds.

First of all the distributions in \(\eta\) and \(p_{T}\) of the \(b\) for the existing \(gg\to H\to hh\) PYTHIA process 152 and our implemented process \(gg\to hh\) process in the resonance region (\(\tan\beta=3\) and \(m_{A}=300\) GeV) are very similar.

For the \(p_{T}\) distribution of the \(b\) and the mass resolution of the \(b\) pairs we have used \(\tan\beta=50\) and \(m_{H}=150\) GeV in the maximal mixing scenario. All Higgs pair production processes were turned on, including the already existing \(f\bar{f}\to AH\) and \(f\bar{f}\to Ah\). For

For \(gg\to Hh\) process at \(\tan\beta=50\) (left plot) and \(gg\to hh\) at \(\tan\beta=3\) for maximal mixing (right plot). The histograms are the VEGAS results and the black dots were obtained with PYTHIA. The main differences between PYTHIA and HPAIR come from the running of \(\alpha_{S}\) and, especially for resonant processes, from the Higgs mass spectrum._

this set of MSSM parameters, Higgs pair production are largely dominated by \(A\) and \(H\) pairs. The following table summarizes the MSSM parameters and cross sections obtained for these processes:

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|} \hline \(\tan\beta\) & \(m_{A}\) & \(m_{H}\) & \(\Gamma_{H}\) & \(\sigma\) & Number of & Number of & Warnings \\  & & (GeV) & & (pb) & generated events & tried events & \\ \hline
50 & 148.9 & 150.0 & 9.1 GeV & 1.46 & 20000 & 113186 & 1 \\ \hline
50 & 148.9 & 150.0 & 9.1 GeV & 1.45 & 20000 & 334236 & 5 \\ \hline \end{tabular}

Where the first line of the table stands for on-shell (\(MSTP(42)=0\)) and the last line for off-shell bosons (\(MSTP(42)=1\)). Events were then analyzed with the ATLAS fast simulation, ATLFAST, to take into account the detector acceptance and resolution. As can be seen on figure 7 the \(b\) pair invariant mass resolution is convoluted with the Higgs width, when bosons are produced off-shell, as expected. The distribution of the jet \(p_{T}\) is very similar and makes very little difference.

The histograms are the VEGAS results and the black dots were obtained with PYTHIA. In this case we used the same routine for the running of \(\alpha_{S}\), thus obtaining a better agreement and leaving only the Higgs mass spectrum difference for the MSSM case._

## 4 Conclusion and prospects

Higgs pair production processes have been successfully implemented in PYTHIA 6.203. Nevertheless in some rare points of the parameters space when using off-shell bosons the behaviour of the matrix elements has still to be investigated.

The analysis of the MSSM neutral Higgs boson production has two main reasons of interests[7, 8, 9, 10]. The first is Higgs discovery which could be achieved either through the study of the resonance production (in this case the cross section according to NLO predictions is of the order of 2 pb) or for high values of \(\tan\beta\) where the cross section for \(\tan\beta=50\) can reach 30 pb. The first case as already been studied in [11] while the second is under analysis.

A second reason of interest is the reconstruction of the Higgs potential which implies the measurement of the Higgs self couplings like \(\lambda_{Hhh}\). Whether this coupling can be measured for double Higgs resonance production with sufficient integrated luminosity at the LHC is under investigation.
