**The ATLAS Inner Detector**

The ATLAS Collaboration

Status Report

## 1 Introduction

Since its Letter of Intent (LoI), the ATLAS Collaboration has chosen a unique baseline concept for the Inner Detector. Based on the physics requirements at both high and lower initial luminosities the functionality of the Inner Detector has been critically reviewed.

The baseline concept presented in this status report combines in its tracking functions robust pattern recognition, precise momentum measurement and impact parameter measurement. Further crucial functions of the Inner Detector are its electron identification capability and its level-2 trigger performance.

Three technologies are used to meet efficiently the physics requirements: semiconductor trackers (SCT) and microstrip gas counters (MSGC) for discrete tracking, and straw tubes for continuous tracking, with the additional capability of detecting transition radiation that provides an independent identification of electrons (TRT).

The cost of the proposed layout is substantially less than that in the LoI, at the expense of less redundancy in the tracking system.

## 2 Physics requirements and functionality

The ATLAS experiment is intended to be of general purpose and capable of wide-ranging exploration and discovery. This implies that the principal aims of the central tracking system must be to contribute to the detection and identification of leptons, photons and hadrons over a large rapidity range, to measure high-\(p_{T}\) charged tracks, and to provide information for the level-2 trigger. We have examined (within the limits of currently available studies) the major 'predicted' physics channels and have classified their detection requirements for the tracker. We have also addressed areas where the central tracking devices complement the essential information from calorimetry and muon detection by improving the robustness of the performance or increasing the acceptance using better trigger or detection thresholds.

### Physics at high luminosity

We believe the following processes to be the major issues at the LHC, and in consequence they impose basic requirements on the tracker. They have therefore been used to optimise its layout:

* the search for the SM Higgs in the full mass range between \(\thicksim 80\) GeV and \(1\) TeV;
* the search for Supersymmetry;
* the search for extensions of the SM (heavy gauge bosons, strong symmetry breaking).

Current ATLAS Monte Carlo studies then indicate the following design parameters for the central tracker at high luminosity:

* the efficient reconstruction of high-\(p_{T}\) leptons in the rapidity interval \(\mid\!\!\mid\eta\mid\!\!\mid<2.5\), and with transverse momenta \(p_{T}>\)7 GeV;
* the measurement of the electron charge sign up to about 500 GeV, which can be expressed as a transverse momentum resolution of 30 % at 500 GeV;
* the reconstruction of low-\(p_{T}\) tracks (\(p_{T}>2\) GeV) near a high-\(p_{T}\) lepton candidate (track isolation and rejection of Dalitz/conversion pairs).

The rapidity coverage should be at least \(\pm\) 2.5 to ensure good acceptance for the intermediate mass Higgs decaying to four leptons and for the H \(\to\gamma\gamma\) decay mode. The acceptance for the former channel also benefits from the possibility of reconstructing leptons with transverse momenta as low as 7 GeV.

The search for the process H \(\to\gamma\gamma\), for a Higgs mass in the region \(m_{H}=m_{Z}\), creates specific additional requirements, increasing the complexity of the design of the Inner Detector. In order to reduce the background from Z \(\to\)\((e\epsilon)\gamma\gamma\) to the level of 10 % of the H \(\to\gamma\gamma\) signal, a veto efficiency of 99.8 % against electrons is needed. In order to achieve such a high veto efficiency it is necessary to identify and reconstruct low \(p_{T}\) electrons (\(p_{T}>2\) GeV) in the event. One should note that, for veto efficiencies larger than 99 %, the residual electron pair background is dominated by hard internal bremsstrahlung processes, leading to final states with two hard photons and two soft electrons, which cannot be searched for using predefined roads from the calorimeter.

The requested momentum resolution arises from the measurement of the charge asymmetry for possible new heavy vector bosons and from searches for strong symmetry breaking, where like-sign W-bosons need to be identified against the large potential background from \(t\overline{t}\) pairs. SDC studies [1] show that an adequate suppression of the background from opposite-sign lepton pairs from \(t\overline{t}\) decays is obtained for a charge misassignment probability of less than \(10^{-5}\) at \(p_{T}=100\) GeV and \(10^{-3}\) at \(p_{T}=500\) GeV. Similar studies are currently under way in ATLAS.

### Physics at low luminosity

Physics processes of particular interest at lower initial luminosities are:* Top quark physics;
* the supersymmetric Higgs sector requiring \(\tau\)-reconstruction;
* CP-violating B-decays.

These processes impose additional requirements on the Inner Detector:

* good impact parameter measurement for b- and \(\tau\)-identification;
* reconstruction of \(J/\psi\) and \(K^{0}_{S}\) decays.

For top quark physics, b-tagging has been shown to be extremely useful in reducing the large combinatorial background from jets produced in the \(t\overline{t}\) events themselves and from non-\(t\overline{t}\) backgrounds. This is particularly relevant for direct measurements of the top quark mass through the reconstruction of three-jet final states, and for the search for a charged Higgs boson produced in top decay.

In addition recent studies have shown that an impact parameter cut combined with lepton isolation rejects the reducible backgrounds (from \(t\overline{t}\) and \(Zb\overline{b}\) to 4-lepton final states) to a level well below the irreducible continuum background from ZZ\({}^{*}\) to four leptons. This would allow the detection of a signal from Higgs decays to 4 leptons over the full intermediate mass range, \(130<m_{H}<180\) GeV, for an integrated luminosity of \(2\times 10^{4}pb^{-1}\).

Another process posing severe requirements on the central tracking system is the reconstruction of CP-violating B-decays in the decay mode \(B^{0}_{d}\to J/\psi K^{0}_{S}\) with the subsequent decays \(J/\psi\to e^{+}e^{-}\), \(J/\psi\to\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\) and \(K^{0}_{S}\to\pi^{+}\pi^{-}\) for \(\mid\eta\mid<1.5\). In this case the inner tracking detector should be able to identify and reconstruct leptonic \(J/\psi\) decays for as low as possible lepton transverse momenta (\(p_{T}\sim 2\) GeV). Studies are in progress to assess the importance of lepton identification to obtain a clean sample of \(J/\psi\) decays. Efficient reconstruction of the \(K^{0}_{S}\) will require a combination of discrete and continuous tracking. It must be stressed that more detailed studies are needed in this field in order to quantify the expected performance.

### Electron identification

Detailed studies have shown that the basic requirements listed above are also adequate for good electron identification, for most of the physics processes considered.

In the most difficult case, the measurement of the inclusive isolated electron spectrum, our simulations have shown that the combined information from calorimetry, preshower and tracking (E/p matching) can reduce the background from jets to the level of the single isolated electron rate, achieving a rejection of \(\sim 10^{5}\), for transverse momenta around 20 to 40 GeV.

The remaining background is dominated by isolated charged pions, which fake the electron signature in the calorimeter. This background can only be further reduced if additional electron identification in the inner tracker is available.

The electron-pair background from \(\pi^{0}/\eta\)-decays is found to be well below the single isolated electron rate, provided that conversions occurring beyond the first sensitive tracking layers can be efficiently rejected. A very efficient first sensitive layer with good spatial granularity, as close as possible to the beam-pipe, would be an important asset to achieve this goal. Furthermore the reconstruction of the low-energy partner electron has been shown to provide another important tool for rejecting residual asymmetric Dalitz-decays or photon conversions if needed.

### Level-2 trigger

The Inner Detector will play a crucial role in providing information to the level-2 trigger over the full rapidity range of the inclusive \(e/\gamma\) trigger, and also for the level-2 muon trigger.

For the most difficult case of the electron triggers, it has been shown that, in addition to the rejection provided by the calorimeter, a rejection factor of about 100 against electromagnetic jets (mainly \(\pi^{0}\)'s) must be achieved, in order to bring the rate to an acceptable level. The Inner Detector should provide this rejection through the reconstruction of stiff track segments in front of the candidate calorimeter clusters.

### Summary

To summarise, we believe that robust pattern recognition and level-2 triggering capabilities are essential for electron physics at LHC, in addition to the quoted momentum measurement accuracy.

We also believe that additional electron identification, on top of that provided by calorimetry, preshower and E/p matching, will be needed for the following physics channels:

* rejection of \(Z\rightarrow(ee)\gamma\gamma\) decays in the search for a \(H\rightarrow\gamma\gamma\) signal, if \(m_{H}\) is close to \(m_{Z}\);
* identification and reconstruction of \(J/\psi\to ee\) decays in the measurement of CP-violating B-decays.

The extra rejection factor against fake electrons would also be useful for:

* a clean measurement of the inclusive electron spectrum, which increases the discovery potential for unexpected new physics;
* additional rejection for the level-2 electron trigger;
* last but not least, it would strengthen the overall electron identification, given the large uncertainties in the cross-sections of the dominant QCD backgrounds and in the prediction of the rejection factors.

In addition it has been shown by CDF that a clean inclusive electron sample provides a very powerful tool for detector calibration, using E/p matching.

## 3 The design of the Inner Detector

### Discrete and continuous tracking

The requirements listed in the previous Section are most efficiently met with the combination of precision discrete tracking and continuous tracking which will result in robust pattern recognition also at the highest luminosity. Precision discrete tracking is needed to reach the goal of a momentum resolution of 30 % at \(p_{T}\) = 500 GeV. Continuous tracking is essential for the reconstruction of low-\(p_{T}\) tracks (\(p_{T}>\) 2 GeV) near a high-\(p_{T}\) lepton candidate, the reconstruction of hadronic \(\tau\)-decays, \(J/\psi\to l^{+}l^{-}\)-decays and \(K^{0}_{S}\rightarrow\pi^{+}\pi^{-}\)-decays.

The Inner Detector is divided naturally into a barrel part between polar angles of 45\({}^{\circ}\) and 135\({}^{\circ}\), and forward parts beyond. In the barrel part, detectors are concentric cylinders, parallel to the beam axis; in the forward part they consist of 'wheels' transverse to the beam axis. This is the natural compromise for reducing the path length of particles through material.

In the barrel region semiconductor technology is used for discrete tracking, and straw tubes for continuous tracking. In the forward region radial microstrip gas counters (MSGC) provide discrete tracking and radial straw tubes continuous tracking. The large-\(\eta\) range is covered by wheels with radiation-hard semiconductor detectors with u- and v-readout (small angle stereo with respect to the radial direction). For the measurement and identification of primary and secondary vertices a semiconductor vertex detector is added close to the interaction point.

Radiator material is introduced before and around the straw tubes for the additional benefit of detection of transition radiation. This strengthens the electron identification capability of the Inner Detector in addition to that provided by the electromagnetic calorimeter, the preshower detector and the E/p matching between electromagnetic calorimeter and the inner tracker.

### The layout

Figure 1 shows the new layout of the Inner Detector. It is located in a cavity of 1.15 m radius and 6.8 m length inside the cryostat of the electromagnetic calorimeter. A superconducting solenoid at a radius of 1.23 m and with a length of 6.3 m, integrated into the cryostat of the electromagnetic calorimeter, produces a magnetic field of 2 T along the beam axis.

The forward part has essentially the same layout as in the LoI, except that an optimization of positions and dimensions has been made for the Transition Radiation Tracker (TRT) which consists of radial straw tubes embedded in radiator material between 50 and 100 cm radius providing \(\phi\)-readout (\(\phi\) is the azimuthal angle). The thickness of the wheels are either 7 or 10.2 cm, and two densities are used, a 'high' density followed by a 'low' density region further away from the interaction point.

The forward detector spans from z = 105 cm to z = 330 cm (z is the coordinate along the beam axis). A 'full' MSGC wheel has been added for improved coverage of the transition from the barrel to the forward region. The MSGC wheels have radial \(\phi\)-, and u-,v-strips with a small stereo angle of about +15 and -15 mrad with respect to the \(\phi\)-strips, respectively, providing with high efficiency a space point on a track passing each wheel. A 'full' wheel has radial coverage between 40 and 100 cm, a 'hollow' wheel between 40 and 50 cm and between 84 and 100 cm.

For the coverage above \(\eta\) = 2.5, wheels of radiation-hard semiconductor detectors are put at z = 58.5, 70, 96 and 109 cm. They are equipped with u-, v- readout with a stereo offset of \(\pm 1^{\circ}\) with respect to the radial direction. The wheels at 58.5 and 70 cm extend radially from 15 to 22.5 cm, those at 96 and 109 cm from 15 to 25 cm.

The barrel region has precision discrete tracking layers between 11.5 cm and 105 cm in radius. The inner layers (at 11.5, 14.5, 20 cm) contribute mainly to the vertex detection, the outer layers (52, 53, 79, 81 and 105 cm) to the momentum resolution. The layer at 30 cm is required for both functions. The layers at 11.5 and 14.5 cm have pixel detectors for providing point information close to the vertex. This technology, if matured in time, is preferable for any inner detector. The layers at 20 and 30 cm consist of double-sided semiconductor detectors with \(\phi\)- and z-readout providing good independent reconstruction of the impact parameter of charged particle tracks in both views for minimal material. The inner layers up to 30 cm require a common support structure for excellent relative alignment.

The precision layers at large radius with large area are equipped with single-sided semiconductor detectors. The precision tracking has four \(\phi\)-measurements at radii of 30, 52, 79 and 105 cm for good momentum determination even at high luminosity and \(\phi\)-matching with the impact point of an electron in the electromagnetic calorimeter. It has z-measurements at 30, 53 and 81 cm for good z-matching with the electromagnetic calorimeter and for reconstruction of \(\tau\), \(J/\psi\) and \(K^{0}_{S}\) decays.

The TRT units have \(2\times 95\) cm long straws parallel to the beam line. The first unit is located between radii of 55.5 and 76.5 cm, the second between 82.5 and 103.5 cm. Two short units with 45 cm long straws parallel to the beam direction are put between 33 and 49.5 cm for good coverage of the transition between barrel and forward region.

The optimization of the layout aims at achieving four points in the discrete precision trackers, without relying on those inside r = 20 cm at highest luminosity, and \(\sim 40\) hits in the continuous trackers on each track over the entire \(|\)\(\eta\)\(|\)-range. We consider this to be a minimum for robust pattern recognition and level-2 triggering.

The choice of semiconductor detectors in the barrel region and of MSGC in the forward parts has been guided by the following considerations. Semiconductor detectors permit optimal use of the very restricted radial space in the barrel part. A superlayer with a \(\phi\)- and z-readout needs about 5 cm radial space. For comparison a similar superlayer of MSGC would require a double \(\phi\)-z layer to account for the intrinsically lower efficiency of a gas layer due to the primary ionisation statistics and would take 10-12 cm radial space. The difference is also due to the thickness of each coordinate layer, about 300 \(\mu\)m for semiconductor detectors and about 3 mm for each MSGC cell. Furthermore, the MSGC also would have to be tilted over the Lorentz angle which is 15\({}^{0}\) with respect to the tangential direction. In the barrel this angle is maximal due to the orthogonality of drift and magnetic fields. For the thin semiconductor detectors this angle can be neglected.

For discrete tracking in the forward part, the MSGC are the most economical solution. Long radial strips can be achieved without daisy-chaining as is necessary for semiconductor detectors. Radial strips of up to 16 cm length are foreseen. Here, the Lorentz angle is zero, or small, as the drift and magnetic fields are parallel except for a small deviation at large z.

A summary of the detectors in this layout is given in Table 1.

### Semiconductor trackers, SCT

The choice of semiconductor technology in the various regions of the barrel part of the inner tracker is based on their function and radial position.

The outer detector layers at radii larger than 50 cm have a large area and are made out of single-sided Si microstrip detectors. This is the most economical solution per unit area. In the \(\phi\)-layers the strips in pairs of adjacent detectors are bonded to reduce the number of electronic channels. Strips in the \(\phi\)-direction have then a total length of \(2\times 60\) mm and a pitch of 195 \(\mu\)m. A potential improvement in resolution is studied using charge division readout which may not necessarily increase the cost. The z-layers have pads of \(\sim~{}20~{}mm^{2}\) giving a z-precision of 300 \(\mu\)m.

The layers at 20 and 30 cm radius are close to the vertex and should have a minimal amount of material to reduce bremsstrahlung effects and photon conversion probability. Double-sided Si microstrip detectors provide the optimal solution, albeit at a higher cost per unit area. Due to the relatively small area this is an affordable solution. Charge division readout is used in order to achieve the required resolution with a readout pitch of 100 \(\mu\)m in r\(\phi\).

The innermost layers at 11.5 and 14.5 cm radius are equipped with Si pixel detectors which provide point information close to the vertex. The pixels themselves are intrinsically more radiation resistant than Si microstrip detectors due to the small pixel size. The limitation is given by the radiation-hardness of the electronics on the detector.

The forward wheels between z = 58.5 and 109 cm at small radius need radiation-hard detectors. For example, MSGC would not be suitable here. Good candidates are gallium arsenide (GaAs) detectors which are currently under development.

A new semiconductor group will coordinate the design of the SCT components.

### Microstrip gas counters, MSGC

Since the presentation of the LoI considerable progress has been made in the understanding of ageing and radiation-hardness of MSGC within the framework of RD28. Further studies are continuing.

The substrate cost of MSGC is estimated to be smaller than that of semiconductor detectors, whereas the cost per electronic channel is the same.

### Straw tubes with detection of transition radiation, TRT

The continuous tracking in the Inner Detector is performed with straw tubes of 4 mm diameter with drift-time measurement capability. The transition radiation function of the continuous tracking requires radial and longitudinal space. This has been accommodated in the layout of the Inner Detector. Therefore, the TR function is a unique additional feature of the ATLAS detector providing independent electron identification.

### The material distribution

Figure 2 shows the material distribution of the layout as a function of radius at various values of \(\eta\). This distribution is composed of contributions of the detectors, their support structures and the services, i.e. power distribution, cooling, signal and monitoring lines, for each detector element. As described above the thicknesses of detectors were carefully chosen according to position for minimal radiation length near the vertex. In a second stage

support structures are designed to guarantee the required position stability of the detector components. Finally, the choice of electronics determines the requirements for the services.

The distributions at \(\eta=0.0\) and 0.5 have less material than those in the LoI due to the decrease of the number of detector layers at small radius. Also those at \(\eta=1.0\), 2.0 and 2.5 remain low up to a radius of 40 cm for the same reason, but they are larger at 50 cm and above due to new estimates of the support structures and the services since the LoI. The material thickness around \(\eta=1.0\) increases at a radius above 80 cm due to the support structure and services in the gap at z = 1.0 m between the barrel and forward regions. The present estimate is that a total of up to about 0.1 radiation lengths of material, measured along the z-direction, might be present in this gap. The distribution around \(\eta=1.5\) suffers most from the support structures provisionally taken for the vertex detector elements and the material in the gap at z = 1.0 m. It is worth noting that this \(\eta\)-region overlaps with the boundary (1.4 \(<\)\(\mid\eta\mid\)\(<\)1.6) between the barrel and end-cap electromagnetic calorimeters for which reduced performance is expected, and which is excluded in physics studies requiring high resolution like \(H\rightarrow\gamma\gamma\).

Engineering studies of the support structures are in progress taking into account compatibility of adjacent detector structures, assembly, alignment and maintenance procedures. Information has been collected on materials used for the detectors, the on-detector electronics, the support structures and the services. Of the last, the low-voltage power distribution and the cooling of the electronics may give the largest contribution.

Optimization of the thickness of supports and services and the routing of the services require an intense engineering effort. The amount of material in the transition region is still unsatisfactory and is the subject of ongoing studies.

## 4 Performance of the Inner Detector

The study of the performance of the new layout follows similar lines to those of the LoI. Detailed simulations are in progress.

### Momentum resolution

Figure 3 shows the momentum resolution of the new layout as a function of \(\mid\eta\mid\). At this stage, the resolution shown is that due to the discrete precision tracking elements only. Up to \(\mid\eta\mid\)= 2, it is better than the resolution goal of 30 % at \(p_{T}=500\) GeV. The deterioration at the start of the transition region is reduced if the contribution of the continuous tracking is taken into account. A detailed description of the material distribution has not yet been included for this new layout, and energy losses from bremsstrahlung will affect the electron resolution. The 'electron' fit described in Section 3.5.2.1 of the LoI will at least partially correct for these losses. Calculations of the momentum resolution including the continuous tracker and the details of the material distribution are in progress.

The momentum resolution also depends strongly on the intrinsic resolution and the alignment precision of the various detectors. The resolution goal is reached for about 30 \(\mu\)m precision in a detector at a radius of 30 to 50 cm. In the barrel region this is obtained from the Si-layer at 30 cm, in the forward part this is achieved with the space points from the u-, v-, \(\phi\)-triplet in the inner ring of MSGCs between 40 and 50 cm of each wheel. The outer layer at 105 cm radius improves the resolution significantly. Table 1 lists the resolution of each detector component. The quoted numbers are an estimate of the intrinsic resolution and the alignment precision.

### Pattern recognition, occupancy

Simulations of the many physics channels of interest are being pursued for this layout. The pattern recognition capabilities are reviewed to demonstrate that high-\(p_{T}\) leptons in the rapidity interval \(|\)\(\eta\)\(|\)\(<\) 2.5 and with transverse momenta \(p_{T}\)\(>\)7 GeV, and low-\(p_{T}\) tracks (\(p_{T}\)\(>\)2 GeV) near a high-\(p_{T}\) lepton candidate can be reconstructed efficiently. We expect results similar to those quoted in the LoI.

Occupancies for the discrete detectors are the same as those shown in the LoI. The occupancy of the straw tracker is large compared to that of the discrete trackers. New careful estimates of the mean barrel straw occupancies at a luminosity of 1.7 \(\times\) 10\({}^{34}\) yield nominal values of 0.45 at the inner radius and of 0.14 at the outer radius, and with pessimistic assumptions corresponding values of 0.62 and 0.24. However, the number of hits is large, typically 33 low threshold hits per track and 12 TR hits per electron over the full \(\eta\) range. The fake track rate in a level-2 trigger road defined by the electromagnetic trigger is below 0.2 % before including drift-time and TR-information, for a 99 % track trigger efficiency (not including bremsstrahlung effects), even for the pessimistic values of the occupancies. In addition, the discrete trackers provide four or more points per track, which can disentangle difficult cases. This results in a very robust pattern recognition capability at high luminosity. Drift time measurement in the straws reduces the occupancy by an additional factor of three and the fake track rate by a factor of 50-100. Finally, the occupancy at a high threshold for TR hits is very low. This information can be used for the identification of electrons, and also for muons with energy above 100 GeV.

Beam tests of the straw tracker using a target to increase the occupancy have been used as input to Monte Carlo simulations showing that for up to 80 minimum bias events the number of fake tracks (with \(p_{T}\)\(>\) 2 GeV) is small and less than the number of real tracks.

Good efficiency for electrons requires crossing of \(\sim\) 40 straws. This corresponds to a depth of about 40 cm. In the proposed layout the TRT has been split in two \(\sim\) 20 cm deep parts in the barrel region. We expect then that about 36 straws are hit per track. This reduces the \(e/\pi\)-rejection of the TRT by about a factor of 2, but it gives flexibility in the optimization and integration of discrete and continuous layers. In the forward region, the number of crossed straws is larger, rising from 40 to 80 as \(\eta\) increases, and the nominal occupancy is \(\sim\) 20%.

The continuous tracking with the TRT is an essential component for the reconstruction of \(K^{0}_{S}\)\(\rightarrow\)\(\pi^{+}\pi^{-}\) decays from B decay for the study of CP- violation. The TRT also has an important function for identifying the electrons with \(p_{T}\)\(\sim\) 2 GeV from \(J/\psi\) decay from the \(B\to J/\psi K^{0}_{S}\) decays, for which precision tracking layers close to the vertex region provide good momentum measurements.

### The vertex detection and impact parameter resolution

The vertex detector covers the range \(|\)\(\eta\)\(|\)\(<\) 1.5, taking into account the length of the interaction region. Recent studies show that impact parameter resolutions of 25 to 30 \(\mu\)m can be obtained for efficient b- and \(\tau\)-tagging. This is essential for top quark physics, \(H\to ZZ^{*}\) searches, reconstruction of hadronic \(\tau\)-decays from the decay of supersymmetric Higgs, and for CP-violating B-decays.

### Electron identification

The performance of the Inner Detector in terms of electron identification is a complex subject, which has been studied extensively [2]. As mentioned in Section 2, most of the ATLAS physics goals, requiring the identification of multi-lepton final states or of electrons with \(p_{T}>50\) GeV, can be achieved using the electromagnetic calorimeter and both spatial and E/p matching for the electron identification. We concentrate here on the more difficult task of inclusive electron identification at lower \(p_{T}\) (\(p_{T}>20\) GeV).

The selection of electron candidates is first performed using calorimeter information, which is expected to reduce the hadronic jet background by a factor of about 1000 for \(p_{T}\)\(\sim\) 20 GeV. After this selection, most of the electron candidates consist of electromagnetic jets containing dominantly \(\pi^{0}\)'s. The main contribution of the Inner Detector to further reduce the jet background consists of the requirement of a stiff charged track matching the calorimeter cluster, both in energy (E/p matching) and space (track/cluster matching).

With such an additional requirement, the jet background is further reduced by a factor of about 100 at \(p_{T}\)\(\sim\) 20 GeV. The remaining background consists of two very distinct sources:

* asymmetric electron pairs from photon conversions or \(\pi^{0}/\eta\)- Dalitz decays where most of the parent energy is carried by the candidate electron;
* high-\(p_{T}\) isolated charged pions which have generated an electromagnetic shower in the calorimeter.

For the rejection of late photon conversions, a large load is carried by the first semiconductor layer. Such conversions can be rejected if a potential electron track candidate has no associated hit in this layer, which has, therefore, to be very efficient.

This leaves the problem of early asymmetric photon conversions and asymmetric Dalitz decays to be dealt with. These give rise to stiff genuine electron tracks with a nearby low-momentum partner. It is in this area where the pattern recognition ability of the continuous straw tracking in conjunction with the transition radiation function is extremely useful. Simulations indicate that if partners can be reconstructed with \(p_{T}>2\) GeV within a limited solid angle around the electron candidate, the rejections obtained against conversions and Dalitz decays are sufficient to bring the background to well below the level of 10% of the genuine isolated electron signal.

In the difficult tracking environment of the LHC the low-momentum partner search is expected to be a formidable task. A cautious approach seems the correct choice in this area, supporting the request for a certain degree of safety and redundancy. The collaboration's choice is to upgrade the continuous straw tracker to a device with transition radiation detection. This permits at the same time a low-momentum electron search with much reducedoccupancy as well as an independent tag of such electrons which is critically needed as the electromagnetic calorimeter will lose its identification power at low electron momenta.

Apart from its help in the recognition of these low-momentum electrons, the TRT provides independent and significant help in further rejecting the other remaining background source consisting of charged pions. With the calorimeter level-1 and -2 trigger algorithms discussed in the LoI, charged pion rejections of a factor 160 at 20 GeV and 500 at 60 GeV have been measured, and a factor 1000 above 100 GeV can be reached. In order to allow for a clean measurement of the inclusive electron spectrum the additional rejection factor of 10 from the transition radiation function is therefore desirable.

### Level-2 trigger

The Inner Detector provides a level-2 electron trigger which plays a crucial role for LHC physics. Actual trigger studies are concentrated on a combined trigger based on both discrete and continuous trackers.

In the barrel region, within the roads defined by the electromagnetic calorimeter, hits in the precision layers at 30 cm and larger and in the TRT can be used for forming a stiff track trigger. In the forward region the trigger can be formed with hits from the MSGC and the TRT within these roads. In the transition region hits from the SCT, MSGC and TRT in both barrel and forward regions are used.

In the LoI, it was shown that the continuous and discrete trackers can provide powerful level-2 triggers. The large number of hits in the TRT provides a robust and conceptually simple electron track trigger which can be obtained by straightforward histogramming along azimuth. The low occupancy in the discrete tracking layers even at the highest luminosity allows for a fast and efficient track trigger. Both systems can provide rejection factors of about 100 against level-1 triggers not containing prompt electrons.

Although the power of the individual systems will be less in the new layout, it is expected that the performance of the combined system will increase the robustness of the trigger at the highest LHC luminosity.

An additional rejection against charged hadrons faking electrons by a factor of \(\sim 10\) is obtained, if transition radiation (TR) hits in the TRT are used (12 TR hits for a high-\(p_{T}\) electron). In this case, looser requirements on the calorimeter trigger may be applied.

A trigger group will study the layout of an integrated level-2 trigger derived from the components of the Inner Detector.

## 5 Radiation-hardness

The radiation-hardness of the components of the Inner Detector is a constant concern of the various R&D groups. For a yearly integrated luminosity of \(10^{5}\)\(pb^{-1}\) the charged particle dose at 10 cm radius from the beam is 32 \(kGy\)\(yr^{-1}\), the albedo neutron (mean kinetic energy \(\sim 1\)\(MeV\)) fluence is \(4\times 10^{12}\) cm\({}^{-2}\)\(yr^{-1}\) with moderator and the direct neutron (\(<\)p\(>=850\) MeV) fluence is \(9\times 10^{12}cm^{-2}\)\(yr^{-1}\). Values of radiation doses for other parts of the Inner Detector have already been quoted in the LoI; for example the neutron fluences at larger radii are significantly lower.

Si detectors have been shown to operate up to radiation doses of 100 kGy and neutron fluences up to 10\({}^{14}\) n cm\({}^{-2}\), GaAs detectors up to 200 kGy and 1-7\(\times\)10\({}^{14}\) n cm\({}^{-2}\). Direct measurements in a nuclear reactor have shown that straws and radiator components of the TRT will operate stably for more than 20 LHC years. Radiation-hardness studies of MSGC show promising progress. Radiation-hard electronics are under development in several places.

## 6 Electronics

An ATLAS electronics group is studying the front end electronics up to the data acquisition system for all detector components. Radiation hard analogue and digital readout, pipeline systems, multiplexing levels and optical fibre drivers are considered depending on type and function of the components. Electronics experts advise us that the now commonly used Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs) allow the design of dedicated front end chips. Dedicated ASICs are to be preferred over multi-purpose ASICs. These would be difficult to design when constrained to satisfy the specifications needed for all detectors, and too costly. However, the subsequent systems can consist of ASIC building blocks which can be used for any of the components, and the final optical fibre readout should be standardized.

## 7 Cost estimate

The cost of the Inner Detector is shown in Table 1. The costs of individual items differ slightly from those given in the Cost Review Group (CORE) due to continuous updating of the costing procedure. The total cost of the layout shown in Figure 1 is 64 MCHF. This amounts to substantial savings of 10 MCHF compared with the estimate shown in the LoI.

## 8 Concluding remarks

In this Memorandum, the ATLAS Collaboration presents its new design of the Inner Detector, in response to the concerns and guidelines put forward by the LHC Committee.

In contrast to the situation at the time of the Letter of Intent, the ATLAS Collaboration now presents a unique baseline design of the Inner Detector, with a significantly reduced cost.

The new design of the Inner Detector has some similarities with the design presented in the Letter of Intent, but is at the same time quite different. The main difference is that the new design has less redundancy, thus making each component vitally important for the overall success of the inner tracking. The main similarities come from the unchanged physics requirements and environmental constraints. They ask for the co-existence of robust pattern recognition, vertexing, precise momentum measurement, and electron identification capability, together with large rapidity coverage, radiation resistance, and affordable cost. The collaboration concluded again that the best compromise between these conflicting requirements consists in the simultaneous use of three technologies: semiconductors, microstrip gas counters, and a straw tracker with transition radiation enhancement.

A Technical Panel coordinates the many activities around the Inner Detector, with a view to their compatibility and with proper attention to technical matters such as support, services, cabling, etc. The groups working on the Inner Detector have been re-organized so as to reflect the new emphasis on the technologies:

* the Semiconductor Group is responsible for all semiconductor components (vertexing, barrel tracker, forward wheels);
* the Trigger Group is responsible for the design of the second level trigger;
* the Electronics Group is responsible for co-ordinating the design of consistent front-end electronics of all subsystems.

Most of the design work for the Inner Detector, and of its associated electronics, depends on the insight and experience gained within a number of dedicated R&D groups. There is an obvious need and also a clear interest in continuing these efforts, although with the focus shifting towards ATLAS subdetector R&D.

Whilst the ATLAS Collaboration believes that a significant step forward has been achieved in the design of the Inner Detector, it is clearly recognized that it is by no means finished, and a lot of work still lies ahead. Particular areas of concern are the minimization of material, assembly, alignment and maintenance procedures.
