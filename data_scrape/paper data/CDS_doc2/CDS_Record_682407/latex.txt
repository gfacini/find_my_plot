## 1 Introduction

In this note we summarize the work recently done in Milano in order to study an alternative procedure to the method described in our previous notes on Susy Higgs [1, 2] for the hadronic \(\tau\) decay identification in ATLAS.

Artificial Neural Networks (RNA) have already been used in many different high energy physics analysis, also in the ATLAS (RD3 and RD33) framework [3, 4], so the present work was mainly devoted to understanding the intrinsic potential of this computation philosophy in separating two classes of rather similar hadronic clusters (\(\tau\)'s and 'normal' jets) using a large number of 'elementary' variables.

Although this study cannot be considered exaustive or complete, the preliminary result here obtained looks very promising and it is possible to think that RNA could play an interesting and relevant role in the future \(\tau\) works.

## 2 The Neural Network and the Standard Identification

The network used is JETNET 2.0 [6], installed on the Milano HP720 by A. Cravero. It is a feed-forward network with a back propagation updatingalgorithm organized on 3 layers according to the architecture \(n_{1}-n_{2}-1\) (\(n_{1}=19\) nodes in the input layer, \(n_{2}=10\) nodes in the single hidden layer and 1 output node). The number of weight parameters to be determined during the training phase is \(n_{u}=(n_{1}+1)n_{2}+n_{2}+1=211\) and the number of independent patterns (i.e. the training events) would be roughly ten times higher. This is the main limitation for the present work (giving a bit pessimistic result) because the training sample, as described below, was slightly under this 'optimal' threshold: \(n_{tr}^{\mathit{used}}\sim 1500\).

The initialization parameters for the network (such as the number of internal nodes, the learning rate (\(\eta\)), the momentum parameter (\(\alpha\)), the decay parameter (\(\epsilon\)) and so on) were taken as the best combination among different attempted sets. We have assumed \(\eta=0.5\)\(\alpha=0.01\)\(\epsilon=5\cdot 10^{-5}\). It is possible to optimize the choice with a more refined tuning but it would require a lot of time without giving, at this level, a significant contribution to the point in discussion.

The variables/criteria used for the \(\tau\) identification in [1]. very similar to those ones used in the other notes and referred as standard from now on. are:

\[\Delta E_{T}^{12}<3\;\mbox{\it GeV}\]

\[R^{cl}(\mbox{\it em})=\Sigma_{i}^{\mathit{Vcells}}\sqrt{\Delta\phi_{i}^{2}+ \Delta\eta_{i}^{2}}E_{Ti}^{\mathit{em}}/\Sigma_{i}^{\mathit{Vcells}}E_{Ti}^{ \mathit{em}}<0.07\]

\[\mathit{NTRAS2}=1\]

where \(\Delta E_{T}^{12}\) is the difference between the transverse energy contained in a cone of \(\Delta R=0.2\) and that one contained in a cone of \(\Delta R=0.1\). \(R^{cl}(\mbox{\it em})\) is the electromagnetic radius of the calorimetric cluster and NTRAS2 is the number of tracks associated to the cluster with \(p_{T}>2\) GeV. (the association radius is \(\Delta R=0.3\)). Distributions of these variables for different classes of clusters can be found in [1]. In addition to these three quantities the RNA was built with 16 more input elements: the transverse energies, normalized to the total transverse energy of the cluster, contained in increasing square windows in the calorimeter, starting from a 3x3 up to a 12x12 configuration were put in the following 9 nodes. Three other nodes contained the \(p_{T}\) of the track of maximum \(p_{T}\) associated to the calorimetric cluster and normalized to total jet \(p_{T}\), the electromagnetic and the hadronic (calorimetric) energies. normalized to the total energy, of the candidate. The last 4 input nodes contained 3 variables similar to NTRAS2 but with different tracks thresholds (0.5, 1.. 1.5 GeV) and finally the impact parameter divided by its uncertainty calculated with the parametrisation of [5]The sample used to train the network was given by: 754 hadronic decaying \(\tau\)'s from both the processes \(A^{0}\rightarrow\tau^{+}\tau^{-}\) and \(W^{\pm}\rightarrow\tau^{\pm}\nu_{\tau}\), fully simulated within the DICE/SLUG/GEANT system as described in [1] and 754 non-\(\tau\) jets, excluding the b-jets, simulated in the same way.

The b-jets are at the moment excluded just to ease the comparison with the results of the standard analysis reported in Table 6 of note [1]; the RNA method is expected to work in a similar way also for b-jets and this will be checked in the near future.

The use of \(\tau\)'s coming not only from \(A^{0}\) decays is due to statistics needs and should deteriorate the identification power of the network compared with the standard analysis because the cuts applied in that case are optimized for \(\tau\)'s energies from the \(A^{0}\) decay and rejects an higher number of \(\tau\) jets from W's (see Table 6 in [1]).

The total number of training cycles (epochs) was set to 1000 (more epochs don't improve significantly the rejection power while the CPU time becomes the dominant constraint). At the end of training, the network was applied to the test sample in order to get the output distribution for \(\tau\)'s and jets as shown in figure 1.

Figure 1: _RNA output distribution for \(\tau\)’s and jets_

The sample used for the test consists of 403 hadronic \(\tau\)'s and 701 jets (classes composed as the training ones but statistically independent).

In fig. 2 the distribution of mean values of the output node for the two classes of clusters as a function of the training epochs is presented. This is useful to monitor the correct behaviour of the network. As expected, the relative distance between \(\tau\)'s and jets increases with the number of epochs indicating that the network follows the correct identification pattern.

## 3 Results

Before giving the RNA results in the form of rejection power against non \(\tau\) jets, it is interesting to look at the distributions of RNA output vs the variables used in the standard identification method. In figure 3 and 4 the comparison between RNA and \(\Delta E_{\gamma}^{1,2}\) or \(R^{el}(\mbox{\it em})\) respectively for the two classes is shown.

\(\tau\)'s are generally well separated from jets and the correlation between

Figure 2: Mean value of output node for \(\tau\)’s and jets vs epoch number.

RNA output distribution and the cut applied on the current variable in the standard analysis is clearly strong.

Figure 5 shows the RNA output vs XTRAS2. For \(\tau\)'s, events contained in the columns NTRAS2=2.4.6 are due to the mis-assignment of a track to a \(\tau\) candidate as an effect of the magnetic field or the association algorithm. Much more interesting is the presence of two well separated sub-classes centered at

RNA output values around 1. and 0.86 in correspondence of the one or three prong decay modes of the \(\tau\).

In figure 6 the ratio \(eff(S)/\sqrt{eff(B)}\) (where \(eff(S)\) and \(eff(B)\) are the efficiencies on real \(\tau\)'s and jets respectively) as a function of the RNA output for \(\tau\)'s is presented. It must be noted that for Susy Higgs studies we need the highest value for \(eff(S)/\sqrt{eff(B)}\), that is contained in the final significance value

Comparing the RNA results - obtained cutting at 0.96 on the output node wich gives \(eff(S)=61.5\%\) and \(eff(B)=2.5\%\) - with the ones coming from the standard analysis (with only statistical errors quoted) we have:

\[eff(S)/\sqrt{eff(B)}^{R,N,4}=38.8\pm 9.1\]

\[eff(S)/\sqrt{eff(B)}^{standard}=27.6\pm 6.9\]

The conclusion is positive and:

\[(eff(S)/\sqrt{eff(B)})^{I\!N,4}\sim 1.4(eff(S)/\sqrt{eff(B)})^{standard}\]

It must be noted at this point that in [1] the rejection power given was about 60 where now is 28. This effect is due to the different and not compatible composition for the various samples in the two cases and doesn't affect at all the conclusion of the present analysis that is based only on the relative

gain between different methods (a check done taking into account the relative statistical weight of \(\tau\)'s from \(A^{0}\) or from \(W\), and the corresponding rejection factors as computed in [1], gives results in agreement with the present one). From this work one can conclude that the network method is a very powerful tool (without the fine tuning - done in the standard analysis - of the cuts in order to obtain the best rejection acheavable on the one prong sample chosen 'a priori' as the cleanest one) that could be used to perform efficiently the analysis also using more track variables and in the case of more complicated situations such as the inclusion of b-jets in the 'background' sample or the separation of different \(\tau\) decay modes.
