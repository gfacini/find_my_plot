**Abstract**

This note aims at presenting some characteristic parameters of the end-cap electromagnetic calorimeter for ATLAS, such as the high-voltage distribution scheme, detector cell capacitances, and electronic noise, in the perspective of a geometry with constant lead thickness, and modified granularity.

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:2]

Introduction

The general geometry of the electromagnetic end-cap calorimeter with absorbers of constant thickness has already been described in [1]. However, some dimensions have evolved, and the granularity and number of absorbers have been modified in order to implement the Descoping Task Force recommendations. In this note we briefly present the new values of geometrical parameters and granularity of the calorimeter. In a second part we discuss the detector behaviour, by computing the detector capacitances and the high voltage distribution required to obtain a constant response over the whole rapidity range. Finally, we estimate the electronic noise and compare it to the pileup noise to derive the optimum shaping time.

## 2 Presentation of the Electromagnetic End-Cap Calorimeter

In the end-cap region, the electromagnetic calorimeter has a fan-like a cordion geometry. Each end-cap covers the rapidity range \(1.375\leq\eta\leq 3.2\) in two concentric wheels, with a separation set at \(\eta\)=2.5. A wheel is composed of eight sectors, or "modules". General parameters of the calorimeter are described in table 1; table 2 lists the materials used; finally tables 4 and 3 give the granularities, multiplicities and numbers of read-out cells in the inner and outer wheels.

Table 1: General parameters of the end-cap calorimeter.

The fundamental parameters of the accordion absorber are the opening angle \(\alpha\), the length of a semi-wave \(\mid_{zig}\). They are linked by the following expression:

\[l_{zig}\,=\,\frac{L/2M}{\sin\frac{\alpha}{2}}\,-\,\frac{2\rho}{\tan\frac{\alpha} {2}}\,+\,(\pi\,-\,\alpha)\rho \tag{1}\]

where \(\rho\) is the radius of the fold (3 and 3.25 mm respectively in the outer and inner wheels). Figure 1 illustrates the shape of the accordion waves (drawn with the interactive atlas simulation software, ATLASIM, and the latest version of DICE).

The shape of a plate before bending is that of a circular sector with an angle \(Q_{0}\) and an inner radius \(r_{0}\); for the accordion plate the length of a semi-wave \(\mid_{zig}\) as a function of the radius \(r\) is then

determined by the parameters \(Q_{0}\) and \(r_{0}\):

\[2M\,l_{{}_{ig}}\,=\,Q_{0}(r\,+\,r_{0})\qquad(2).\]

For any radius \(\alpha\) is obtained by combining (1) and (2) and solving numerically the resulting non-linear equation.

The liquid argon gap is then given by:

\[g\,ap\,=\,\frac{2\pi\,r}{N_{abs}}\sin\frac{\alpha}{2}\,-\,e_{pass}\qquad(3)\]

where \(e_{pass}\) is the thickness of the passive material. Figure 2 shows the variation of the gap computed at the middle of each sampling, for both wheels.

## 3 Behaviour of the detector

### Detector capacitances

This is an update of what had been done with the former geometry [2]. Capacitances are computed for each sampling, the planar approximation is used:

\[C_{d}\,=\,\,\epsilon\,\times\,\frac{Surface}{Gap}\qquad(4),\]

where the surface of a pad is approximated by a trapezium, whose bases are respectively the \(\Delta r\) at the beginning and the end of the sampling, and whose height is the proper number of half-waves multiplied by \(l_{{}_{ig}}\). Samplings are untapered in our geometry and are 1.5, 4.5 and 3 waves long in the outer wheel, and both samplings are 3 waves long in the inner wheel. Gap and \(l_{{}_{ig}}\) are taken at the middle of a given sampling. The capacitances due to the kapton and copper pads become negligible when added in series with the liquid argon gap capacitances.

Figure 2: Liquid Argon gap variation in the Electromagnetic End-Cap

The results of the computations are shown in figure 3. It can be seen that capacitances may be considered constant in the precision region (first sampling of the outer wheel), at \(\approx\) 150pF, and fitted elsewhere as:

\[C_{4}\ =\ \alpha\ +\ \beta\tan^{2}\theta\ \ \ \ (5)\]

### High voltage distribution and conversion factor

The conversion factor \(I_{0}/E\), ratio between the induced current and the energy deposited in a cell, is computed by using the relation:

\[I_{0}\ =\ \frac{Q}{t_{drift}}\ \ \ \ (6)\]

with

\[t_{drift}\ =\ \frac{gap}{v_{drift}}\ =\ \frac{gap^{1.3}}{2.34\cdot 10^{5}U^{0.3}} \ \ \ \ (7)\]

(U is the High Voltage in kV, gap is in cm, and the coefficient for \(v_{drift}=k\times(U/gap)^{0.3}\) comes from values for the RD3 Barrel where U was 2kV, gap was 0.19 cm and t\({}_{drift}\) was 400 ns. This expression of \(t_{drift}\) and the one adopted in Ref [3] give very similar results.)

The expression for the deposited charge \(Q\) for a given energy deposit \(E\) is:

\[Q\ =\ \frac{E}{W_{i}}\ \times\ \eta_{s}\ \ \ \ \ (8)\]

Figure 3: _Detector cell capacitance in the Electromagnetic End-Cap. Capacitances in the outer wheel have higher values outside the precision region 1.5\(\leq\eta\leq\)2.4: \(\eta\) granularity is coarser in Sampling 1, and there is no third sampling for \(\eta\leq\)1.5._

with the ionization energy for liquid argon \(W_{i}\) = 23.6 eV, and the sampling fraction \(\eta_{s}\) has been calculated for electron showers, taking into account the modulations induced by the accordion round-folds. It has been shown in [1] that this analytic calculation is in good agreement with the behaviour obtained with the detailed Monte Carlo simulation.

Figure 4 shows the sampling fractions and the high voltage distribution required if one wants to obtain a uniform response of the calorimeter over the rapidity range. Calculations of the H.V. were made at the center of the detector in depth, where a H.V. varying between 0.9 and 2.6 kV (1.5 and 2.5 kV) leads to a conversion factor of \(\approx\) 2.35 nA/MeV (\(\approx\)1.9 nA/MeV) in the outer (inner) wheel. The corresponding electric field and drift times, calculated at the center of each sampling, are given by Fig. 5. The electric field is kept below 10 kV/cm, and drift times vary between 200 and 600 ns in the outer wheel, between 350 and 600 ns in the inner wheel.

Figure 4: Left: sampling fractions \(\eta_{s}\); Right: high voltage distribution in the Electromagnetic End-Cap to achieve constant response at the center of the calorimeter.

Figure 5: Left: electric field; Right: drift times obtained with the above HV distribution

In the real configuration, it will not be possible to achieve a "continuous" variation of the high voltage. The number of voltage steps will be limited by the number of mother boards, with at most one value at either end of a given board. An example of such a distribution is shown in figure 6, with six steps in the outer wheel and two in the inner wheel. The calorimeter response will thus vary slightly along the rapidity range of each mother board, as can be seen in Fig 7. Some correction (i.e. calibration constants) will have to be added at the reconstruction level. The electric field will also be affected, though it remains within the 8-11 kV/cm range with the H.V. values given here.

### Electronic noise

Our calculations are based on new measurements [3], which give the noise of the complete electronic chain (0T preamps with 6 meter long 50 or 25 \(\Omega\) cables) as a function of the response time \(t_{p}(\Delta)\) of the chain to a triangular pulse, for fixed values of the detector capacitance \(C_{4}\). As can be seen in figure 8, it appears that noise is lower with 25 \(\Omega\) cables, when the shaping time is short, as soon as \(C_{4}\) is larger than 400 pF. As in the barrel, 50 \(\Omega\) cables could be used for the first sampling and 25 \(\Omega\) cables for the middle and back samplings.

With this configuration, the Equivalent Noise Current for individual cells in the End-Cap at \(t_{p}(\Delta)\)=30 and 40 ns is presented in figure 9.

Figure 8: (from C. de La Taille) Comparison of the measured noise with 25\(\Omega\) or 50\(\Omega\) cables, as a function of the shaping time, for two typical values of capacitances in the endcap.

Figure 9: Equivalent Noise Current (ENI). Left: for shaping time \(t_{p}(\Delta)\)=30ns; Right: \(t_{p}(\Delta)\)=40nsWith the conversion factors given in the previous section (the ideal ones, obtained with a continuous variation of the H.V.) we find (Fig. 10) that for a global shaping time of 30 ns the equivalent noise varies between 80 and 150 MeV in the inner wheel, is constant at 25 MeV for strips and varies roughly between 40 and 100 MeV in the second and third compartments of the outer wheel. Wether inside the inner or outer wheel, noise decreases for larger rapidities.

It should be noted that these figures have large error bars (\(\pm\)20%), coming from the geometrical approximations for the capacitances and from uncertainties on ENI.

### Pileup noise and optimal shaping time

A parametrization have been given in [4] for the pile-up noise in the end-cap electromagnetic calorimeter: \(\sigma_{pu}\ =\ 290\) MeV / \(\sin\theta\) at the highest LHC luminosity, \(10^{34}\)cm\({}^{-2}\)s\({}^{-1}\). The summation was performed at \(t_{p}(\Delta)\)=40ns, considering 18 minimum bias events per bunch crossing and \(\Delta\eta\times\Delta\phi=0.075\times 0.17\) (\(\eta\times\phi=3\times 7\) cells) clusters. If we apply the factor \(\sqrt{4/3}\) to take into account the empty bunch out of four, and we introduce the \(\sqrt{t_{p}(\Delta)}\) dependence, we see (Fig 11) that \(\sigma_{pu}\) increases dramatically with the rapidity. Figure 12 illustrates the difference of behaviour between the electronic and pileup noises, at \(t_{p}(\Delta)=30\)ns (where \(\sigma_{pu}-\sigma_{el}\) is minimal).

The electronic noise in the outer wheel is the contribution of 2 (\(\phi\)) \(\times\) 3\(\times\)(8 or 6) strips (sampling 1), plus 3 \(\times\) 7 (\(\eta\times\phi\)) cells (sampling 2), plus 2 \(\times\) 7 (\(\eta\times\phi\)) cells (sampling 3). The cluster in the inner wheel is made of 2 cells in S1 and 2 cells in S2.

Finally, figure 13 shows the sum \(\sigma_{tot}=\sigma_{pu}\oplus\sigma_{el}\) as a function of \(t_{p}(\Delta)\), for two values of \(\eta\). In any case the pileup noise dominates, which leads us to choose as optimum the fastest peaking time achievable, \(t_{p}(\Delta)\)=30 ns.

### H.V. current and power dissipation due to the pileup

As described in [2], the current induced by the pileup events in a high voltage cell can be estimated by:

\[I_{cell}\ =\ \frac{2Q\,q_{e^{-}}<E_{cell pileup}(MeV)>}{R_{HV}C_{HV}}\ \times\ (n_{ bunch}=R_{HV}C_{HV}/25\cdot 10^{-0}) \tag{9}\]

where 2Q is the deposited charge (both electrons and ions are collected), \(R_{HV}C_{HV}\) is the time constant of the HV cell, and \(n_{ bunch}\) is the number of bunch crossings that occur during this time.

With Q\(\approx\)6000 (\(e^{-}\)/MeV deposited), this gives \(I_{cell}=(80nA)<E_{cell pileup}(MeV)>\).

Considering that the pileup energy is mainly deposited in the first sampling, one can infer from values shown in fig 12 the power dissipation in the 1M\(\Omega\) HV pad resistors.

It is at the level of the \(\mu W\)/resistor in the outer wheel, at the level of the \(mW\)/resistor in the inner wheel, and thus less than \(1W\) for the entire end-cap.

## 4 Dynamic range

In order to update the estimations done in ref. [2] about the maximum signal to be expected in the endcap, such as with the decay of a 5 TeV \(Z\)', we generated 5 TeV electromagnetic showers with _DICE_.

The simulation was performed in the framework of the _96_1 release, including the full set of detector geometries.

Runs of 50 events each were obtained at four rapidity locations, between \(\eta\)= 1.6 and \(\eta\)= 2.3. Calibration was achieved with high statistics 100 GeV \(e^{-}\) runs, all material in front of the endcap removed.

As a first step, and in order to save computing time, the _CUTS_ on secondary particles in the _GEANT datacard_ were set at 10 MeV. This probably resulted in tighter showers and somewhat pessimistic estimates about the highest energy expected in a given cell.

Figure 13: Total noise for different shaping times. Left: \(\eta\)=1.8; Right: \(\eta\)=2.2Another potential problem with the _GEANT_ code has to be kept in mind, namely an ill management of the multivolumes, that was cured in the _96\(5\) and later versions of the routine _GMEDIA_.

This resulted in a loss of energy as particles disappeared unexpectedly from the tracking.

Despite these restrictions the results of this study are, by and large, in agreement with the figures quoted in ref. [2]. Figure 14 shows the reconstructed signal of such a 5 TeV shower in a 5 by 5 window, at \(\eta\)=1.9. The corresponding energy distributions in the cell of maximum signal, for each sampling, are presented in Fig. 15. Table 5 gives the maximum expected signals for each sampling, at the four rapidities considered here.

[2], by assuming 60% of the energy to be deposited in the central cell, gave respectively 200 GeV, 2500 GeV and 500 GeV for samplings 1, 2 and 3.
