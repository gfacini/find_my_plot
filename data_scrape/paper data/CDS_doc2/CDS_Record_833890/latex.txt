**Abstract**

The reconstruction of J/\(\psi\) decays to \(e^{+}e^{-}\) pairs is investigated with DC1 data. The low energy electrons produced are reconstructed by a dedicated algorithm. A rejection of pion tracks of \(\sim 450\) is obtained for an electron identification efficiency of 90%. The background to the J/\(\psi\) events is estimated from \(b\bar{b}\to\mu X\) events. The J/\(\psi\) reconstruction efficiency is found to be \(\sim 20\%\), and the signal to background ratio around 2. The quality of the J/\(\psi\) mass reconstruction using the Inner Detector only is compared with previous studies. The emphasis of this analysis is on the use of J/\(\psi\to e^{+}e^{-}\) decays to calibrate the electromagnetic calorimeter. For this purpose, the mass reconstruction uses the energy taken from the electromagnetic calorimeter. Results obtained show that the intercalibration of the 448 motherboard regions (\(\Delta\eta\times\Delta\phi=0.2\times 0.4\)) can be obtained with a statistical precision of \(\sim 0.4\%\) after a year of data taking at low luminosity.

Introduction

The determination of a common energy scale of the Inner Detector (ID) and the Liquid Argon Electromagnetic Calorimeter (LArEM) is of crucial importance for all analyses that will use information coming from both detectors. This will be the case when making use of electrons for invariant mass or transverse momentum measurement, which are both quite general tools. A possibility to establish this common energy scale is to use the decay of resonances into electron pairs. Such electrons are produced by the decay of \(Z^{0}\), and can be used to calibrate the electromagnetic calorimeter within this energy range [1]. To cross-check the calibration obtained from the \(Z^{0}\) decays and also to check the linearity of the calorimeter, it is important to have calibration coefficients for a lower electron energy range. This can be done using the \(\mathrm{J}/\psi\to e^{+}e^{-}\) decays.

The constraints of the \(\mathrm{J}/\psi\) mass can be used also to study the overall constant term. Test beam experience has demonstrated that a constant term better then 0.5% can be achieved in \(\Delta\eta\times\Delta\phi=0.2\times 0.4\) regions of the electromagnetic calorimeter [2]. Within the calorimeter acceptance used for precision measurements (\(|\eta|<2.5\)) there are 448 such regions 1. Even if inside each region a local constant term of 0.45% will be achieved by construction, possible non-uniformities from region to region cannot be excluded. Non-uniformities related to the detector mechanics can be measured and corrected for. However, the final calibration will only be done _in situ_, since for instance the amount of material in front of the electromagnetic calorimeter in the real experiment will be different from the test beam. The required region-to-region intercalibration accuracy is \(\sim 0.5\%\), if a global constant term of 0.7% over the full LArEM coverage is aimed at.

Footnote 1: The standard region dimension corresponds to two motherboards in azimuth, equivalent to two HV sectors in the barrel. In each end-cap, there are four mother boards and seven HV sectors, along pseudorapidity, for the considered acceptance. We follow prescription of [3] and choose the HV sector definition, which leads to higher number of regions. There are two regions in \(\eta\) which have \(\Delta\eta=0.1\).

This note is organised as follows. A description of the data used is presented in section 2. Section 3 details the electron identification procedure. Section 4 explains the reconstruction of the \(\mathrm{J}/\psi\) candidates and details the expected resolution in the invariant mass. Finally, in section 5 the results obtained on the intercalibration of the AtlasLArEM are presented.

## 2 Data samples

Due to a large beauty production cross-section and a selective trigger, Atlas can reconstruct large samples of exclusive \(B\)-hadron decays. Since \(B\) particles are produced in pairs, it is possible to use the muon coming from the semileptonic decay of one of the \(B\)'s, and to look for a \(\mathrm{J}/\psi\to e^{+}e^{-}\) decay in this event. The cross section for \(pp\to b\bar{b}\) with one of the \(b\) giving a muon of \(p_{T}>6\) GeV/c for the level 1 trigger 2 and a meson decay \(B\to J/\psi\) with \(\mathrm{J}/\psi\to e^{+}e^{-}\) is estimated to be \(2\times 10^{-4}\)\(\mu\)b. About \(4\times 10^{6}\) events are expected in one year of low luminosity running at \(2\times 10^{33}\) cm\({}^{-2}\) s\({}^{-1}\). With a typical reconstruction efficiency of \(\sim 20\%\), \(\sim 8\times 10^{5}\) fully reconstructed events can be expected.

Footnote 2: Since the start of this analysis, and the production of data under DCI, a new muon trigger menu is foreseen. The \(p_{T}\) threshold could be higher: for a threshold of \(p_{T}>14\) (20) GeV/c the cross section will be about 5 (15) times smaller. Another solution foreseen will be to use a di-muon menu. As the level one uses only muon, no bias on the selection of \(\mathrm{J}/\psi\to e^{+}e^{-}\) is expected. The numbers used in this analysis will have simply to be rescaled to the new expected trigger rate.

A total of \(250\times 10^{3}\)\(bB_{d}\to\mu(6)J/\psi(e^{+}e^{-})K_{S}(\pi^{+}\pi^{-})\) events has been generated(cf. Tab. 1). A minimum \(p_{T}\) threshold of 2 GeV/c is applied to the generated electrons. It is assumed that the analysis, in terms of \(J/\psi\) mass reconstruction and intercalibration of the LArEM, is not sensitive to the final state as in principle an inclusive (\(b\bar{b}\to J/\psi X\)) analysis should be performed. The direct production of \(J/\psi\) mesons is not investigated in this analysis.

The background is studied using a sample of \(90\times 10^{3}\)\(b\bar{b}\rightarrow\mu 6X\) events. It contains muons from semileptonic \(B\)-hadron decays with a minimum muon transverse momentum of 6 GeV/c. It is used to estimate the background from fake J/\(\psi\) arising from lepton-lepton, lepton-hadron and hadron-hadron pairs.

The Monte Carlo events were generated for the Data Challenge 1 (DC1) [4] with Pythia 6.203 [5] under the Athena framework (release 5.0.0) and stored in Root format [6]. The generated events were simulated in the detector with the GEANT 3 [7] based ATLASIM/DICE program version 3.2.1 [8] under Athena release 6.0.1. The inputs were the event kinematics from Root-format files and the output was the detector hits and digits in ZEBRA-format files. No pile-up was added. They were reconstructed using Athena release 7.8.0. Tracks in the ID are reconstructed using xKalman. All options are set to the default values, and the internal bremsstrahlung fit is enabled. The electronic noise in the calorimeters is included by default. The same data have been also reconstructed without the electronic noise.

Kinematics of signal electrons from J/\(\psi\) decays and of pions from background is presented in Fig. 1, both for generated and reconstructed \(\eta\) and \(p_{T}\). Signal electrons are produced mainly in the central region of pseudorapidity and have harder transverse momentum spectrum than background pions.

## 3 Electron reconstruction

The first step in the analysis is the identification of the low transverse momentum electrons. Given the \(B\) and J/\(\psi\) masses, the \(p_{T}\) of the electrons coming from the J/\(\psi\) cannot be very high with respect to the axis corresponding to the initial \(b\) quark. The electron clusters are in general not isolated. The ID is used to provide a starting point, indicating precisely where to look in the calorimeter, and also giving powerful estimators to tag electrons. A soft electron reconstruction and identification package has been developed in the context of b-tagging in the Athena framework. Its performance can be found in [9]. A short description is given hereafter.

### Overview of the soft electron identification

Only tracks with \(p_{T}>2\) GeV/c are used. The _good quality_ cuts are imposed on tracks: at least two hits in the pixel detector (one of them in the B-layer), at least nine precision hits (pixels + SCT) and the transverse impact parameter of the track \(|A_{0}|\leq 1\) mm. Apart

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|} \hline Process & dataset & Nb of events \\ \hline \(bB_{d}\rightarrow\mu(6)J/\psi(e^{+}e^{-})K_{S}(\pi^{+}\pi^{-})\) & 013901 & 250 \(\times\) 10\({}^{3}\) \\ \(b\bar{b}\rightarrow\mu(6)X\) & 012500 & 90 \(\times\) 10\({}^{3}\) \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 1: _Process, dataset number for DC1 production as well as the number of events used in this analysis._from above cuts two further selection criteria are applied: at least 20 hits and at least one high threshold hit in the TRT detector on the track.

All the tracks that pass the _good quality cuts_ are extrapolated to each sampling of the calorimeter. For each one, the cell with the maximum energy is searched within a small \(\eta\) and \(\phi\) window around the extrapolation point: \(3\times 3\) in the presampler, \(3\times 1\) in the strip compartment, \(3\times 3\) in the middle and \(3\times 1\) in the back sampling. In each sampling the list of cells around the one with the maximum energy is established. A cluster is created and a set of discriminating variables is defined basing on transverse and longitudinal shapes of electromagnetic showers, combining calorimeter and the ID information. All calculated variables are added to the standard combined ntuple. Further analysis is performed with a set of private kumacs and fortran code.

### Discriminating variables

The variables used to identify reconstructed tracks as electrons and to reject other tracks can be classified as follows:

- Variables using the ID information only:

* number of high threshold hits in the TRT detector on the track;
* transverse impact parameter.

-Variables using combined information from the ID and the LArEM:

Figure 1: _Transverse momentum \(p_{T}\) and pseudorapidity \(|\eta|\) of signal electrons (hatched histograms) and pions from background (plain histograms)._

- ratio of the reconstructed transverse energy in the LArEM, to the transverse momentum in the ID;
* difference between the track and the shower positions measured in units of distance between the strips, where \(i_{m}\) is the impact cell for the track reconstructed in the ID and \(E_{i}\) is the energy reconstructed in the \(i\)-th cell in the \(\eta\) direction for constant \(\phi\) given by the track parameters.

- Variables using LArEM information only:

* fraction of the energy reconstructed in the first compartment of the LArEM;
* fraction of the energy reconstructed in the third compartment of the LArEM;
* shower isolation in the LArEM from the ratio of energy reconstructed around the extrapolation in \(3\times 3\) and \(3\times 7\) clusters;
* is calculated using the highest energetic strip and its neighbour on each side.

More details on the presented variables can be found in [9]. Distributions of each discriminating variable for signal electrons from \(J/\psi\) decays and pions from background samples are shown in Fig. 2.

Figure 2: _Distributions of the discriminating variables. Hatched histograms - signal electrons from \(J/\psi\), empty histograms - pions from background samples._

### Construction of the discriminating function

The distributions of the discriminating variables are treated as probability density functions (PDFs) and smoothed using the PAW smoothing procedure.

Since they are \(\eta\) dependent (see Fig. 3), the threshold values are tuned in several intervals: (0-0.8), (0.8-1.4), (1.4-1.8), (1.8-2.0) and (2.0-2.4). The crack in the calorimeter between \(1.37\leq|\eta|\leq 1.52\) is excluded from the analysis. The first two bins cover the barrel electromagnetic calorimeter. The subdivision is motivated by the varying granularities, lead thickness and material in front of the electromagnetic calorimeter. The dependence with the transverse momentum is less important, but still significant for some variables. Fig. 4 shows the mean values of each discriminating variables as a function of the transverse momentum \(p_{T}\). Two bins in \(p_{T}\) are considered to optimise the PDFs: \(2\leq p_{T}<10\) GeV/c and \(p_{T}\geq 10\) GeV/c. The intermediate value of 10 GeV/c corresponds to the approximate limit of the transverse momentum of pion tracks (see Fig. 1).

For each track the discriminating function \(D_{track}\) is calculated as:

\[D_{track}=log\frac{\prod_{i}P_{e}(x_{i})}{\prod_{i}P_{h}(x_{i})}, \tag{1}\]

where \(x_{i}\) denotes the value of the \(i\)-th variable for the given track, \(P_{e}(x_{i})\) is the probability, obtained from the single variable \(x_{i}\) that the track originates from a signal electron, \(P_{h}(x_{i})\) is the probability that the track originates from a hadron and \(i\) runs through all the variables used by the algorithm. To avoid any bias of performance the samples to estimate the discriminating function have to be different than the one which provides the

Figure 3: _Mean values of the discriminating variables for the signal electrons (circles) and pions (triangles) in function of \(|\eta|\)._PDFs. For that purpose, 10% of the signal statistics (\(\sim 25\times\) 10\({}^{3}\) events) and half of the background one (\(\sim 45\times\) 10\({}^{3}\) events) was used for PDFs preparation. The rest is used for the performance estimation.

Distributions of \(D_{track}\) obtained for signal electrons and background pions tracks are shown in Fig. 5. The ratio of likelihood \(D_{track}\) does not take into account correlations between the variables. It reflects in distributions obtained for electrons and pions which overlap and present large tails.

### Electron identification efficiency

The identification of a candidate track as originating from a signal electron is based on the value of the discriminating function \(D_{track}\) assigned to the given track. Those tracks for which the value is below a given threshold are rejected. The identification efficiency versus the rejection power of the algorithm is obtained by varying the value of this threshold.

The electron identification efficiency is defined as \(\varepsilon_{e}=N_{e}^{t}/N_{e}\), where \(N_{e}\) is the number of _good quality_ signal electron tracks in the signal samples and \(N_{e}^{t}\) is the number of _good quality_ signal electron tracks identified as a signal electrons track. The charged pion rejection is defined as \(R_{\pi}=N_{\pi}/N_{\pi}^{t}\), where \(N_{\pi}\) is the number of _good quality_ pion tracks, and \(N_{\pi}^{t}\) is the number of _good quality_ pion tracks misidentified as a signal electron track.

For an electron identification efficiency \(\varepsilon_{e}\) = 90%, the rejection of pions tracks is 450 \(\pm\) 13. Optimising the PDFs in \(p_{T}\) bins improves performance by \(\sim\) 20%. A larger improvement is obtained when optimising also in 5 \(\eta\) bins, with performance increased

Figure 4: _Mean values of the discriminating variables, for signal electrons (circles) and pions (triangles) in function of \(p_{T}\)._

by \(\sim 50\%\). Tab. 2 and Fig. 6 detail performance obtained for various electron identification values. Results on samples reconstructed without the electronic noise are \(\sim 30\%\) higher.

### Cross-check of performance

Performance can be cross-checked with the inclusive \(b\overline{b}\) sample. For a given event, the method outlined above is applied to each reconstructed good track and its discriminating variable is formed. For this, new PDFs are obtained from \(b\overline{b}\) events.

Fig. 7 shows the rejection against individual pions as a function of the electron identification efficiency. The electrons mostly originate from heavy flavour, however some may come from conversions or Dalitz decays. Results are detailed for signal electrons only (dots) and for all electrons (squares). For a signal electron identification efficiency \(\sim 90\%\), the pion rejection is \(\sim 480\) in good agreement with results obtained in Tab. 2. The rejection is \(\sim 40\%\) lower when PDFs are built with all electrons.

Fig. 8 shows the rejection of background events compared to the efficiency for identifying signal events (with \(b\to e\)). The performance is worse than for individual particles since in the background events, there will be several tracks, any of which may be mis-identified as an electron.

### Energy reconstruction

The soft electron reconstruction is geared towards the best electron/hadron separation and has not been optimised for the energy measurement. For that reason the standard clusters corrections were not applied on the soft electron clusters. The soft electron energy is computed from: \(3\times 3\) in the presampler, \(15\times 3\) in the strips, \(5\times 5\) in the middle, \(3\times 7\) in the back what creates cluster different than \("\,5\times 5"\) used by the standard electron reconstruction algorithm. As for the J/\(\psi\) mass reconstruction a precise measurement of an electron energy is crucial, following corrections had to be applied on the analysis level:

* Out-of-cone correction from Athena: since part of the total shower energy leaks out of the cluster, the correction for the finite containment for a given cluster size is applied. In presented studies coefficients for \(5\times 5\) cluster size are used. It should be stressed that the lateral leakage corrections have been calculated using \(E_{T}=50\) GeV photons.
* The longitudinal weights from electron based calibration [10]: this calibration strategy follows a modified parametrisation for the energy reconstruction: \[E_{\rm rec}=\lambda(b+w_{\rm ps}E_{\rm ps}+E_{\rm str}+E_{\rm mid}+w_{\rm back }E_{\rm back}),\] (2) where \(\lambda\) is a global scale factor, \(b\) is an offset with the units of energy, \(w_{\rm ps}\) is the presampler weight, \(w_{\rm back}\) is the weight for the third sampling supposed to correct for longitudinal leakage. \(E_{\rm ps},E_{\rm str},E_{\rm mid}\) and \(E_{\rm back}\) are the energies measured in the particular layers of the electromagnetic calorimeter. The calibration approach consists in removing, on cluster level, existing DC1 cell-level weights and applying the new calibration parameters obtained on \(Z\to e^{+}e^{-}\) events for \(3\times 7\) clusters. This calibration can be used only for \(|\eta|\;<\;1.37\). For endcaps, an overall factor (typically \(\sim 1.01-1.02\)) is applied.

No other cluster corrections as \(\eta\), \(\phi\) modulations and barrel/endcap crack are used but they have smaller impact on energy reconstruction than the corrections described above. Also no cluster positions corrections for S-shape and \(\phi\)-offset are applied on soft electron clusters. This will have the drawback that the (\(\eta\), \(\phi\)) measurement from the LArEM is not reliable in this study.

In Fig. 9 the ratio between reconstructed and true energy for signal electrons as a function of \(|\eta|\) is presented. The same plots with and without corrections described above are shown. Without corrections energy reconstructed is lower than generated on average by 5% and can reach 10% for the low energy (\(E_{\rm gen}<8\) GeV) particles. As it could be expected better reconstruction of electron energy is obtained with corrections applied. Nevertheless it can be noticed that the corrections do not work in sufficient way for lower energy electrons as they were tuned for higher energy particles and different cluster sizes. It is foreseen in the future to apply all cluster corrections in Athena, to test them with test beam data and possibily tune these corrections to the low energy electrons.

## 4 Reconstruction of J/\(\psi\)

The identification of electrons is performed using the soft electron identification algorithm described above. In the following, the electron identification efficiency is tuned to 90%.

Pairs of electron candidate tracks are obtained. These pairs define the acceptance \(a_{J/\psi}\sim 32\%\) of J/\(\psi\) events. This acceptance is the product of the losses due the removal of the crack in the electromagnetic calorimeter, the track quality cuts, as well as the electron identification efficiency...

Pairs of reconstructed opposite-charge tracks are fitted to a common vertex using the CDF fitter CTVMFT package (\(B\) physics working group [11]). Successful fits (\(\chi^{2}\)/d.o.f \(<6\)) are retained. The fitted transverse decay length \(L_{xy}\) of the reconstructed J/\(\psi\) is required to be greater than 250 \(\mu\)m. The \(L_{xy}\) is defined as:

\[L_{xy}=\frac{\vec{D}\cdot\vec{p}_{T}(J/\psi)}{\|\vec{p}_{T}(J/\psi)\|}, \tag{3}\]

where \(D\) is the distance between the primary and secondary vertices and \(p_{T}(J/\psi)\) is the J/\(\psi\) reconstructed transverse momentum.

Fig. 10 shows the invariant mass distribution after different level of cuts in signal events. At first, when selecting only pairs of good tracks with opposite charged, a huge combinatorial background can be seen (dashed histogram). This background is largely reduced by applying the electron identification criteria. Finally, the hatched histogram shows the invariant mass obtained after the application of all analysis cuts. The J/\(\psi\) reconstruction efficiency \(\varepsilon_{J/\psi}\) is then defined as the ratio of the number of candidates passing all the analysis cuts and being in the mass window \(2.1-4.1\) GeV/\(c^{2}\), above the number of candidates that satisfy the acceptance cuts. It is typically around 60%, corresponding to a total reconstruction efficiency \(a_{J/\psi}\times\varepsilon_{J/\psi}\sim 20\) %. The background sample consists of \(b\bar{b}\) events where one \(B\)-hadron is forced to decay into a muon and the other decay freely. In Fig. 11 distributions of distances between two tracks, \(\Delta R=\sqrt{\Delta\eta^{2}+\Delta\,\phi^{2}}\), are shown for all combinations. For signal events, almost no combination has large value of \(\Delta R\). On the contrary there remains a large part of the background

Figure 9: _The ratio between reconstructed and true energy, without (triangles) and with (circles) mentioned corrections, as a function of \(|\eta|\) for all signal electrons (left panel) and for signal electrons with \(E_{gen}<8\) GeV (right panel)._events. A further cut is applied asking for \(\Delta R<1.5\). This cut has almost no influence on the number of signal events, and moreover, it does not bias the shape of the invariant mass distribution of background events.

When estimating the signal to background ratio the following weight factor is taken into account:

\[R_{BR}=\frac{Br(B\to X)}{Br(B\to J/\psi X)\times Br(J/\psi\to e^{+}e^{-})}= \frac{1}{0.011\times 0.0.6}=1500. \tag{4}\]

For the number of signal events \(\sim 250\times 10^{3}\), the necessary amount of background events cannot be fully simulated. Thus we have to rely on a toy Monte Carlo. To do this, at first the analysis is run on the \(90\times 10^{3}\) fully simulated background events. Inside the mass window \(2.1-4.1\) GeV/\(c^{2}\), after all analysis steps, there remain only a few background events from the full simulation, typically \(\sim 3\). It corresponds to an efficiency \(\varepsilon_{b\overline{b}}\sim 3.3\times 10^{-5}\). The "effective" branching ratio which has to be taken into account is:

\[R_{BR}^{eff}=R_{BR}\times\varepsilon_{b\overline{b}}\times\varepsilon_{J/ \psi}\times a_{J/\psi}. \tag{5}\]

The shape of the distribution to be generated is obtained with pions only, assuming they can represent the spectrum. The invariant mass distribution of the candidate pairs is shown in Fig. 12 and fitted, in the mass window, by a function which in this case is a

Figure 10: _Invariant mass distribution for all track combinations in events containing \(J/\psi\to e^{+}e^{-}\). Distributions are shown for all pairs of opposite charges after track quality cuts (dashed histogram), after electron identification (solid histogram), and after applying all analysis cuts (hatched histogram)._

Figure 11: \(\Delta R\) distributions for signal (left panel) and background events (right panel). Distributions are shown for all combinations (open histograms) and after all analysis cuts (dashed histograms), except the \(\Delta R\) cut. For background events, the electron identification is not applied.

sum of two exponentials. Once the shape is known, as well as the number of events to simulate, the events are generated by the Monte Carlo technique of acceptance-rejection method.

The number of fully simulated background events passing the analysis cuts is quite small. Thus, there is an important statistical uncertainty on the number of events to generate. To estimate the sensitivity of the performance to this poor knowledge, some extreme scenarios have been tested. Lower and upper limits on the number of background events are simulated according a Poisson statistic, for a confidence level of 95%.

The J/\(\psi\) mass can be determined from the electron energies and directions. For calibration purpose, the energy is taken from the electromagnetic calorimeter. One may want to determine the mass purely from the LArEM to control systematic uncertainties, but the \(\eta\) and \(\phi\) measurements based on the soft electron algorithm are not reliable as the size of the cluster used was too big and cluster position corrections were not applied. The directions are thus taken from the more accurate measurements provided by the Inner Detector, albeit with a potential problem of biasing the track direction by bremsstrahlung.

Fig. 13 shows the electron candidates pair invariant mass distribution obtained from the signal sample only. The J/\(\psi\) efficiency \(\varepsilon_{J/\psi}\), as defined above, is estimated to be around 64%. It can be noted that the distribution is slightly asymmetric. Thus, an asymmetric gaussian function is fitted, with different width, \(\sigma_{\rm left}\) and \(\sigma_{\rm right}\), either side of the fitted peak mass \(m_{0}\). It is performed in a narrow mass interval, between 2.7 and 3.5 GeV/\(c^{2}\). The parameter \(\sigma_{\rm right}\) characterises the effective resolution in the invariant mass, while \(\sigma_{\rm left}\) is a measure of the deterioration of this resolution due to bremsstrahlung. The fitted values of the parameters \(\Delta m_{0}=m_{0}-M_{J/\psi}\), where \(M_{J/\Psi}=3096\) MeV/\(c^{2}\) is the nominal J/\(\psi\) mass, \(\sigma_{\rm left}\) and \(\sigma_{\rm right}\) are shown in Tab. 3. Results obtained with a symmetric gaussian function are given in annexe B. Performance are assessed separately

Figure 13: _The electron pair invariant mass for signal events (left panel) and with background events included (right panel). The direction information is taken from the ID, the energy reconstruction from the LArEM. For signal events only, an asymmetric gaussian fit is done in the mass interval \(2.7-3.5\) GeV/\(c^{2}\). When taking into account background events, the sum of two decreasing exponentials is added to the fitted function._

for the barrel region of the LArEM, when both electrons have their pseudorapidity \(|\eta|\) within \(\pm 1.4\), for the end-cap region, when at least one electron has \(|\eta|>1.4\), and for the full \(\eta\) range. The reconstructed \(J/\psi\) mass is shifted by \(\sim 37\) MeV/\(c^{2}\). The shift is particularly important in the endcaps were it reaches \(\sim 80\) MeV/\(c^{2}\). It is an artefact of the energy corrections which are applied as described in section 3.6 and are not optimised in the low energy range of electrons used in this study. The resolution obtained from the width of the gaussian is \(\sim~{}250\) MeV/\(c^{2}\), but highly asymmetric.

Right panel of Fig. 13 shows the invariant mass distribution obtained when background events are taken into account. In this case, two decreasing exponentials are added to the function to be fitted. Tab. 3 shows the gaussian parameters of these fits. They remain similar to the case of no background, with a resolution of \(\sim~{}240\) MeV/\(c^{2}\). The sensitivity of the gaussian parameters is studied by maximising or minimising the amount of background which is simulated in the toy Monte Carlo. Tab. 4 shows the results of the fits. Parameters of the gaussian part of the fit are not too senstive to the level of background which is used.

It is possible to obtain two histograms from these fits: one for candidates tagged as signal events and one for background. From the signal candidates the J/\(\psi\) efficiency, can be estimated to be 54%. About 10% of J/\(\psi\) candidates are mistagged as background ones, mostly on the edge of the mass interval \(2.1-4.1\) GeV/\(c^{2}\). The signal to background ratio is estimated also from these two histograms. The statistical uncertainty is derived from the toy samples, simulated with a lower and an upper limit on the level of background to simulate. The signal to background ratio is then estimated to be \(S/B=2.2\pm 1.2\).

## 5 LArEM intercalibration

About \(4\times 10^{6}\)\(J/\psi\to e^{+}e^{-}\) events are expected in one year of data taking at low luminosity. It corresponds to \(\sim 8\times 10^{5}\) fully reconstructed events, using a \(\sim 20\)% reconstruction

To determine the intercalibration coefficients this section follows prescription used for \(Z\to e^{+}e^{-}\) events, as described in [3].

### The method

For each region \(i\) a bias \(\alpha_{i}\) is generated according to a gaussian distribution centered at 0, with a variance \(\sigma^{2}_{\textit{bias}}\). All the electron candidates falling in region \(i\) have their energy \(E_{i}\) biased following:

\[E_{i}^{bias}=E_{i}\times(1+\alpha_{i}). \tag{6}\]

The invariant mass \(M_{ij}\) of two electrons from regions \(i\) and \(j\) is given by:

\[M_{ij}=\sqrt{2E_{i}E_{j}(1-\cos\theta)}, \tag{7}\]

where \(\theta\) is the angle between them. The biased invariant mass is related to the original one by:

\[M_{ij}^{bias}=M_{ij}\times(1+\frac{\alpha_{i}+\alpha_{j}}{2})=M_{ij}\times(1+ \frac{\beta_{ij}}{2}), \tag{8}\]

where \(\beta_{ij}=\alpha_{i}+\alpha_{j}\) if the second order terms are neglected.

The biased invariant mass for a couple of regions (\(i\),\(j\)) depends linearly on a single parameter \(\beta_{ij}\). It can be fitted to a reference invariant mass distribution before bias, and \(\beta_{ij}\) and its error \(\sigma^{\beta}_{ij}\) can be determined. By scanning the \(\beta_{ij}\) domain, a \(\chi^{2}\) minimisation between the reference and the biased distributions is done and \(\beta_{ij}\), \(\sigma^{\beta}_{ij}\) are extracted.

To recover the \(\alpha_{i}\)'s biases a least square method is applied:

\[A=U^{-1}\times B, \tag{9}\]

where \(A(i)=\alpha_{i}\), \(B(i)=\sum_{|j|\text{if}(|i|)\,|\,3}\beta_{ij}/\sigma^{\beta\ 2}_{ij}\) and:

\[U(i,j) = 0\text{ if }(i,j)\text{ is empty} \tag{10}\] \[= \frac{1}{\sigma^{\beta\ 2}_{ij}}\text{ if }i\neq j,\] \[= \sum_{|\text{if}(|i|)\,|\,3}\frac{1}{\sigma^{\beta\ 2}_{ik}}\text{ if }i=j\]

The errors on \(\alpha_{i}\)'s are computed as \(\sigma^{\alpha}_{i}=\sqrt{U^{-1}(i,j)}\). The precision of the intercalibration is given by a width of a gaussian function fitted to the recovered bias \(\alpha^{rec}_{i}\) pull distribution \((\alpha_{i}-\alpha^{rec}_{i})/\sigma^{\alpha}_{i}\).

### Application to J/\(\psi\) events

A complication compared to the \(Z\to e^{+}e^{-}\) case is that, as shown in previous section, the invariant mass of electron pair candidates shows a large contribution from background events. To obtain reference invariant mass distribution, these background events should be removed. The fit of the sum of the gaussian and two exponentials, as mentioned in section 4, is performed on the reference distribution. Using fit parameters the background is removed and put in separate reference histograms. As a result two separate reference mass histograms are kept, one for signal and the other for background events. For each couple of regions (\(i\),\(j\)), a similar procedure is undertaken. The background is subtracted from the biased mass distribution using the reference background histogram. The invariant mass distribution left after background removal is fitted to the reference signal distribution. Only couples of regions with more than 15 events left are used. The values of \(\beta_{ij}\) and their errors \(\sigma_{ij}^{\beta}\) are extracted from the minimisation of the \(\chi^{2}\) as described above. This minimisation is done in a narrow mass interval, typically between 2.1 and 4.1 GeV/\(c^{2}\). The \(\beta_{ij}\) are then easily found. The method is thus a priori sensitive to the shape of background which is simulated via the toy Monte Carlo. Moreover, due to the lack of statistic used for fully simulated background events, there is also an a priori sensitivity to the signal to background ratio. On the other hand, the minimisation of the \(\chi^{2}\) is done in a narrow mass interval, where parameters of the gaussian fit to the mass distribution was found not to be sensitive to the level of background simulated. Thus, the background shape, as well as its level, is expected not to be a crucial issue.

Due to the low statistic available, differences in number of events in each bin can be observed while scanning the \(\beta\) domain which reflect in large fluctuations in the \(\chi^{2}\) distribution. This has the drawback to render difficult the associated error estimation. Enlarging bin size solves the problem only partially. Besides to this, the solution adopted is to extract values of \(\beta_{ij}\) and their errors \(\sigma_{ij}^{\beta}\) from parabola fitted to \(\chi^{2}\) distribution.

Another complication is that low energy electrons are highly sensitive to the material distribution in the front of the calorimeter. To check the sensitivity to this effect, a total of 50 regions is defined for \(|\eta|<2.5\). Each region \(i\) corresponds to an azimuthal ring of \(\Delta\eta=0.1\). The method is applied without injecting biases, \(\alpha_{i}=0\) on the signal events only. In Fig. 14 differences between injected \(\alpha_{i}\) and recovered \(\alpha_{i}^{rec}\) biases are presented. Similar features due to the lack of energy cluster corrections can be seen in Fig. 9. As the effects of the material in front of the LArEM should not be mixed with the intercalibration, the method is run only on events with both electrons inside \(|\eta|<0.8\).

Moreover, as shown in Fig. 11, the shape of the distributi

Figure 14: _Differences between injected \(\alpha_{i}\) and recovered \(\alpha_{i}^{rec}\) biases in \(\Delta\eta=0.1\) azimuthal rings for signal events only._

between pairs of tracks is different for signal and background events. This results in different population of signal and background, thus different S/B ratio, in different pairs of regions (\(i\),\(j\)). In Fig. 15 the S/B ratio is presented as a function of a difference in pseudorapidity \(\Delta\eta(i,j)\) between a couple of regions (\(i\),\(j\)). For \(\Delta\eta(i,j)>1\), the S/B ratio is too small (S/B \(<1\)) to be used for the intercalibration purpose. Thus such couples are not taken into account. Presented S/B ratios are calculated for the reference, not biased invariant mass distributions.

Because of varing S/B values, different reference mass histograms are prepared for 8 regions in \(\eta\). In Fig. 16 some examples of the reference distributions are presented for different \(\Delta\eta(i,j)\) values, for signal and background events and signal only. The fits to the invariant mass distributions are shown.

### Results for intercalibration

Due to the low statistics available only 32 regions are defined, 8 in \(\eta\) and 4 in \(\phi\) which correspond to \(\Delta\eta\times\Delta\phi=0.2\times 1.57\). In \(|\eta|<0.8\) range, \(22\times 10^{3}\) signal events survived the cuts. To all 32 regions a bias with \(\sigma_{bias}=2.5\%\) is injected. The number of non-empty couples of regions (\(i\),\(j\)) is 143.

Fig. 17 shows distributions of pulls for \(\beta_{ij}^{rec}\) and \(\alpha_{i}^{rec}\) recovered. The width of a gaussian fitted to the distributions is close to 1. The \(\alpha\) residuals distribution is presented in Fig. 18. The bias can be recovered with a precision given by the width of a gaussian fitted on this distribution, which is \(0.6\%\pm 0.3\%\). The statistics used, \(22\times 10^{3}\) events inside \(|\eta|<0.8\), is equivalent to \(308\times 10^{3}\) events with 448 regions. It can be extrapolated to 0.4 % with \(800\times 10^{3}\) events. This results is better than the one reported in TDR [1] which was 0.6%, but is due, essentially, to the increase of the integrated luminosity and thus the expected number of events after a year of data taking. Doing such an extrapolation, one may not forget that events with \(|\eta|<0.8\) are better reconstructed than in all the other regions and the above result for the precision of the intercalibration is slightly overestimated.

Crosscheck is done using only 16 regions, thus with higher statistic inside regions. A precision of the \(\alpha\) recovery \(\sigma=0.3\%\) is found, in agreement with results for 32 regions. If

using signal events only, the value of \(\sigma\) found is \(\sim 0.3\%\). Finally, different values of \(\sigma_{bias}\) were checked, \(1.5\%\) and \(5.0\%\), giving similar results as for \(\sigma_{bias}=2.5\%\).

## 6 Conclusion

This note presents the reconstruction of J/\(\psi\) decays into \(e^{+}e^{-}\) using DC1 data. The emphasis of this note is on the use of the electron from the Liquid Argon Electromagnetic Calorimeter. The identification of electrons uses an algorithm dedicated to electrons of low transverse momentum. For an electron identification efficiency of 90% a high rejection (\(R_{\pi}\sim 450\)) of pion tracks originating from background events is found. The algorithm implemented in Athena does not yet incorporate all the necessary corrections to have a reliable energy measurement. The main corrections are applied during the final stage of the analysis, but are derived from isolated electrons and photons of much higher energies. The J/\(\psi\) events are reconstructed by selecting the pair of electron candidates and fitting them to a common vertex. Using the ID information only, performance obtained are in good agreement with previous studies. Moreover, the electron identification is now based on reconstructed quantities and not on the Monte Carlo truth. Background events are also included comparing with those studies. The J/\(\psi\) mass is also reconstructed with energy measurement from the electromagnetic calorimeter. The resolution on the invariant mass is around 240 MeV/\(c^{2}\). The signal over background ratio is found to be \(S/B=2.2\pm 1.2\).

The J/\(\psi\) events are used for the intercalibration of the electromagnetic calorimeter. An

analysis, similar to one developed for \(Z\to e^{+}e^{-}\) events is performed. The reconstructed invariant mass is very sensitive to the amount of material in front of the electromagnetic calorimeter and to S/B ratio. The intercalibration method is adapted to this fact and several reference distributions are used. The results obtained for the barrel part of the LArEM and extrapolated to the endcap region show that the intercalibration of the 448

motherboard regions (\(\Delta\eta\times\Delta\phi=0.2\times 0.4\)) can be obtained with a statistical precision of \(\sim 0.4\%\) after a year of data taking at low luminosity. Still, the method is found to be sensitive to the energy reconstruction, and a good energy reconstruction of low energy electrons still has to be proved to be feasible. Moreover the method is found to be sensitive to the _a priori_ unknown shape of the background. Finally results could have to be rescaled if other trigger strategies are applied. Results have to be obtained taking into account pile up events.

Reconstruction of J/\(\psi\) using the ID only

The emphasis of this note is the use of the LArEM to identify low \(p_{T}\) electrons, and reconstruct the invariant mass of \(J/\psi\) events. Previous studies [12] used the ID only to reconstruct the invariant mass. This section is devoted to a comparison to these studies.

Fig. 19 shows the electron pair invariant mass distribution from the ID information only for signal events (left panel) and once background events are included (right panel). The electron identification is tuned to an efficiency of 90%. The fitted function is an asymmetric gaussian with different values \(\sigma\), \(\sigma_{\rm left}\) and \(\sigma_{\rm right}\), either side of the fitted peak mass \(m_{0}\). The parameter \(\sigma_{\rm right}\) characterises the effective resolution in the invariant mass of the pair, while \(\sigma_{\rm left}\) is a measure of the deterioration of this resolution due to bremsstrahlung. The fits are performed in a narrow mass interval, between 2.85 and 3.15 \({\rm GeV}/c^{2}\) when no background is included.

The fit quality is good except to reproduce the peak of the distribution. The fitted values of the parameters \(\Delta m_{0}=m_{0}-M_{J/\psi}\), where \(M_{J/\psi}=3096\)\({\rm MeV}/c^{2}\) is the nominal J/\(\psi\) mass, \(\sigma_{\rm left}\) and \(\sigma_{\rm right}\) are shown in Tab. 5. The J/\(\psi\) reconstruction performance are

Electron identification efficiency is tuned to 90%. An asymmetric gaussian fit is performed in the mass window \(2.85-3.15\)\({\rm GeV}/c^{2}\). When taking into account background events, the sum of two decreasing exponentials is added to the fitted function. The fit is restricted to the range between \(2.65-4.1\)\({\rm GeV}/c^{2}\)._

Results obtained in this analysis are similar to the ones obtained in [12] despite many changes in the analysis itself. In [12], the electrons coming from the \(J/\psi\) decays have a generated \(p_{T}\) threshold of 4 GeV/c (instead of 2 in this analysis) and are reconstructed with Atrecon 4.4.0. The electron identification was based on the Monte Carlo truth and no background events were included. The shift and broadening of the J/\(\psi\) peak, already seen in [12] and in TDR [13], is still present, especially at high pseudorapidity values.

When taking into account the background events, a sum of two decreasing exponential is added to the function to be fitted. It is not possible to fit the distribution over the all mass range as the gaussian cannot represent the left side of the distribution. The mass interval used to fit is between \(2.65-4.1\) GeV/\(c^{2}\), so slightly enlarged compared to the case with no background, as a too small part of the left side of the peak would be taken into account. The asymmetric gaussian function is thus found not to be good one when studied sample contains background events.

Another solution is to fit these distributions using an asymmetric function, which behaves as a Breit-Wigner distribution \(\sim\Gamma/(\Delta m_{0}^{2}+(\Gamma/2)^{2})\) to the left of the peak \(m_{0}\), and as a gaussian of width \(\sigma_{\rm right}\) to the right of the peak, in the whole interval \(2.1-4.1\) GeV/\(c^{2}\), as shown in Fig. 20.

The parameter \(\sigma_{\rm right}\) characterises the effective resolution in the invariant mass distribution of the pair, while \(\Gamma\) is a measure of the intensity of energy loss by the electrons due to the bremsstrahlung. In the presence of background events, the sum of two decreasing exponential is added to the function to be fitted. The fitted values of the parameters \(\Delta m_{0}\), \(\Gamma\) and \(\sigma_{\rm right}\) are shown in Tab. 6. The peak is not well reproduced, as for the fit with a gaussian. Still, compared to the gaussian fit, it is possible to reproduce the tails of the distribution in presence or absence of background

events. Moreover, the parameters of the Breit-Wigner function are not too affected by the presence of background events. The shift in mass is around 42 MeV/\(c^{2}\), larger in the endcap than in the barrel. The parameter \(\Gamma\) is around 300 MeV/\(c^{2}\). The gaussian width, estimated from the right part of the distribution is around 54 MeV/\(c^{2}\). This asymmetric function allows then a better description of the invariant mass distribution obtained in the ID.

Results are presented without (top panels) and with background included (bottom panels)._Reconstruction of J/\(\psi\) using the LArEM

The "natural" function to be fitted on the invariant mass distribution using the LArEM is a gaussian. In this section, results obtained with a standard symmetric gaussian are given. Fig. 21 shows the invariant mass distribution for signal events. The electron identification efficiency is tuned to 90%. A gaussian fit is done between 2.7 and 3.5 GeV/\(c^{2}\) and the fitted values are shown in Tab. 7. The J/\(\psi\) reconstruction performance are assessed separately for the barrel, when both electrons have \(|\eta|\leq 1.4\), for the endcap, when at least one electron has \(|\eta|>1.4\), and for the full \(\eta\) range. The fit quality is rather good, even if the peak is not perfectly reproduced. The \(J/\psi\) mass is slightly shifted for the endcap case, around 25 MeV/\(c^{2}\).

Right panel of Fig. 21 shows the invariant mass distributions obtained with background events. The fitted function is the sum of a gaussian and two decreasing exponentials. Tab. 7 details the gaussian parameters. They remain similar to the case where no background events were taken into account, with a resolution of \(\sim~{}240\) MeV/\(c^{2}\).
