###### Abstract

The temperature coefficient (TC) of the gas gain of straw tubes to be used in the TRT detector have been experimentally determined using three different methods. The values obtained are close to each other. The average value of TC obtained by three methods is 2.575 %/\({}^{\circ}\)C.

## 1 Introduction

The mechanical complexity of TRT detector results in temperature differences between different parts of the detector in spite of build-in efficient cooling system. The temperature variation of the gas mixture affects the density of the working gas, thus changing the growth of the electron avalanche, i.e. the gas gain \(A\).

This undesirable effect has to be compensated by varying the HV in such a way as to keep the \(A\) constant (for \(A\) = const, HV=HV(T)).

The influence of the temperature on the gas gain was studied in straws over the temperature range from 18\({}^{\circ}\)C to 35\({}^{\circ}\)C for the standard TRT mixture of Xe/CO\({}_{2}\)/CF\({}_{4}\) - 70/10/20.

The measurements of the pulse height were normalised to the peak position at the temperature T=20\({}^{\circ}\) C for which the gas gain was set to \(A\)=2*10\({}^{4}\) under atmospheric pressure.

## 2 Direct measurements of temperature coefficient of gas gain

These measurements were made using two different spectrometric chains:

- Current preamplifier based on chip 6800... (LABEN) + multichannel analyser
- model 3001 LeCroy, set in \(q\) sensing mode,

- Charge sensitive preamplifier model 142 PC EG ORTEC + multichannel analyser model

OMEGA 1, CANBERRA, peak sensing mode with internal amplifier.

The temperature effect was measured in parallel for two straws connected in parallel to the supply of the working gas. The straws were flushed inside and outside by the same mixture. This system of the straws and stainless steel gas heat exchanger were kept in the thermostat (insulated thermal envelope). The readout electronics was outside thermal envelope. The temperature in this thermostat was stabilised with accuracy better than 0.1 degree C.

The change in gas gain was determined from the measured peak position in pulse height distribution of \({}^{55}\)Fe line.

The measurements were made at constant pressure p=1010 hPa for HV=1520V and HV=1560V. The results are shown in Fig. No 1, 2, 3 and 4.

It is seen clearly that peak position (thus gas gain) linearly depends on temperature. It was found that the temperature shift of the gas gain/pulse height is equal 2,74 %/\({}^{\circ}\)C and 2,54 %/\({}^{\circ}\)C for HV=1520 V and HV=1560 V, respectively.

## 3. Diethorn expression for gas gain

The measurements of the gas gain factor, \(A\), as a function of the operating voltage have been performed using the _current method_. The gas gain factor is defined as a ratio of the total number of electrons reaching the anode to that of the primary ionisation. The graph on Figure 5 shows gas gain in the so-called Diethorn parameterisation.

Diethorn expression for gas gain is defined as follows:

\[\frac{\ln A}{pr_{a}S_{a}}=B\ln S_{a}+C\;\;\mbox{where}\;\;S_{a}=\frac{E}{p}= \frac{U}{pr_{a}\ln\frac{r_{k}}{r_{a}}},\]

\(S_{a}-\) reduced electric field strength on the surface of anode wire,

\(p-\) working gas pressure at 20 \({}^{\circ}\)C,

\(r_{a}-\) radius of the anode,

\(r_{k}-\) radius of the cathode,

\(B\), \(C-\) constants, characteristic for the given gas mixture which have to be determined experimentally.

By simple transformation one can get:

\[\ln A=\frac{UB}{\ln\frac{r_{k}}{r_{a}}}\ln S_{a}+C_{1}\]

where: \(C_{1}-\) another new constant.

Assuming that

\(U\), \(r_{a}\), \(r_{b}\), \(p-\) are kept constant

one gets ; \(A\)=\(A(\rho)\), \(\rho\)=\(\rho\)(T) \(\Rightarrow\)\(A\)=\(A\)(T)

where: \(\rho\) - gas density.

This yields to

\[\ln\frac{A}{A_{0}}=\frac{UB}{\ln\frac{r_{k}}{r_{a}}}\ln\frac{T}{T_{0}}\]

where:

\(A_{0}=2*10^{4}\) (working point of straw tubes)

\(T_{0}=293\) K (20 \({}^{\circ}\)C).

From Diethorn plot, Fig. No 5, constant B was determined and equals B=0.023 [1/V]. Thus the temperature coefficient calculated from the Diethorn's expression is \(\frac{\Delta A}{A_{20}\Delta T}=2.65\%/\,^{\circ}C\).

## 4 Pressure dependence of the gas gain

The change of the working gas density (which directly manifests in gas gain variation) can be caused by both the temperature and pressure.

From the equation for perfect gas one calculates that change in temperature \(\Delta T=1^{\circ}C\) gives the same change in gas density as the change in pressure by \(\Delta p=3.4hPa\). Assuming that variation in the temperature leads only to the change in gas density, TC can be calculated from pressure dependence of gas gain. The measurements of the peak position/gas gain for the \({}^{55}\)Fe were carried out at the different pressures (at fixed operating voltage) in the straws.

These results are presented on Fig. No 6 and 7.

The peak position linearly decreases with increase of the pressure. The pressure coefficient \(\frac{\Delta A}{A_{1000}\Delta p}\) were found to be -0.68 % / hPa, and -0.71 % / hPa (using two described set-ups) what is equivalent to temperature coefficients \(\frac{\Delta A}{A_{20}\Delta T}=2.32\%/\,^{\circ}C\) and 2.44 %/\({}^{\circ}\)C, respectively.

## 5 Conclusion

Three different methods of temperature coefficient measurements gave the TC value in the range from 2.32 %/\({}^{\circ}\)C to 2.83 %/\({}^{\circ}\)C with the average value of 2.575 %/\({}^{\circ}\)C. The temperature coefficients were measured at very small changes in absolute gas gains. The influence of gas gain value on the temperature coefficient is under study.
