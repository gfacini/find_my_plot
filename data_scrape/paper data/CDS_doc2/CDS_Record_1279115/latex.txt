###### Abstract

This note describes a study of the discovery potential for the supersymmetric Higgs bosons \(H/A\) in proton-proton collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 14 \(\,\mathrm{TeV}\) in final states with \(\tau\)-lepton pairs with the ATLAS detector at the LHC. The Higgs bosons are produced in association with \(b\)-quarks or from gluon-fusion processes and decay into a di-\(\tau\) final state. The final state where one \(\tau\) lepton decays leptonically and the other hadronically is studied. Higgs boson masses between 150 and 800 \(\,\mathrm{GeV}\) are analysed. All results are obtained using the ATLFAST-II simulation of the ATLAS detector except for the determination of the trigger efficiencies. For the latter, selected signal samples are processed with full simulation. Procedures to estimate the contribution of all relevant backgrounds from control regions in data have been developed.

The discovery potential in the \(m_{A}\) vs. \(\tan\beta\) plane is assessed for the \(m_{h}^{\mathrm{max}}\) MSSM benchmark scenario and compared to that obtained previously in the fully-leptonic analysis. No pile-up or cavern background has been considered in this analysis. The analysis is based on an integrated luminosity of \(30\,\mathrm{fb}^{-1}\).

Introduction

In the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM), two Higgs doublets are required, resulting in five observable Higgs bosons, three of which are electrically neutral (\(h\), \(H\), and \(A\)) while two of them are charged (\(H^{\pm}\)). At tree level their properties such as masses, widths and branching fractions can be predicted in terms of only two parameters, typically chosen to be the mass of the CP-odd Higgs boson, \(m_{A}\), and the ratio of the vacuum expectation values of the two Higgs doublets, \(\tan\beta\).

In the MSSM the couplings of the Higgs bosons to fermions and bosons are different from those in the Standard Model resulting in different production cross sections and decay rates. While decays into \(ZZ\) or \(WW\) are dominant in the Standard Model for Higgs boson masses above \(m_{H}\sim 160\) GeV, in the MSSM these decay modes are either suppressed by \(\cos(\beta-\alpha)\) for the \(H\) boson (where \(\alpha\) is the mixing angle of the two CP-even Higgs bosons) or even absent for the \(A\) boson. However, the coupling of the Higgs boson to third-generation fermions is a function of \(\tan\beta\) and is therefore strongly enhanced for large regions of the MSSM parameter space. The decay of the neutral Higgs bosons into a pair of \(\tau\) leptons therefore constitutes an important discovery channel at the LHC. The production of the Higgs bosons can proceed via two different processes: gluon-fusion or production in association with \(b\) quarks.

This note discusses the discovery potential for neutral MSSM Higgs bosons produced in either mode at a center-of-mass energy of \(\sqrt{s}=14\) TeV in ATLAS at the LHC. In this analysis, the Higgs boson decays into a pair of \(\tau\) leptons. The final state where one \(\tau\) lepton decays leptonically and the other hadronically is studied. Higgs bosons in the mass range between 150 and 800 GeV are analysed and therefore only the contributions from \(H\) and \(A\) are relevant. Events are classified in the analysis depending on whether a \(b\) jets was found in the event. This maximises the discovery potential since the composition of the background is different for these two classes of events. Methods to estimate the contributions of all relevant background processes from control regions in data have been developed. The discovery potential is assessed in the \(m_{h}^{\rm max}\) scenario [1] as a function of the two parameters of the model, \(m_{A}\) and \(\tan\beta\). No pile-up or cavern background has been considered in this analysis. The analysis is based on an integrated luminosity of 30 fb\({}^{-1}\). The results are compared to that from the analysis of the fully leptonic channel published in [2].

The ATLAS detector is described in detail elsewhere [3]. The identification of the decay mode \(H/A\to\tau^{+}\tau^{-}\to\ell h^{1})\) requires excellent performance of every detector subsystem and therefore constitutes a benchmark channel to assess the overall detector performance. The full reconstruction of the \(\tau\tau\to\ell h\) final state involves \(\tau\)-lepton reconstruction and identification, and the determination of missing transverse energy, \(E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}\), in the event. In the part of the analysis where a \(b\) jet is required in the final state, a good understanding of the \(b\)-tagging efficiency and the rejection rate for light-quark jets is required. In addition, important Standard Model background processes originating from \(Z\)+jets, \(W\)+jets, \(t\bar{t}\) and QCD di-jets processes need to be well understood in order to exploit the full discovery potential of this channel.

This note is organized as follows: The production processes for the Higgs boson signal and the relevant background processes are discussed in Section 2. The preselection of the physics objects are discussed in Section 3 and the event selection is detailed in Section 4. Sources of systematic uncertainties are described in Section 5. Data-driven background estimation for all relevant background contributions are discussed in Section 6. The results and the estimated discovery potential are presented and discussed in Section 7.

Signal and background processes

### Higgs boson production

In the MSSM, Higgs bosons are produced via gluon-fusion processes, which are dominant for low Higgs boson masses and small values of \(\tan\beta\), or via production in association with \(b\) quarks. The cross sections for Higgs boson production have been calculated using HIGLU [4] for gluon-fusion processes and bbh@nnlo[5] for \(b\)-associated production. The systematic uncertainties on the cross sections include a variation of the factorisation and renormalisation scale and the uncertainty on the parton density functions used. The values used in this analysis are summarized in Table 1. Since the \(H\) and the \(A\) bosons are mass degenerate in the region of phase space considered in this analysis, their respective cross sections are added. The mass of the \(h\) boson, with a maximum of \(m_{h}\sim 130\) GeV, lies well outside the mass windows for most of the parameter space considered in this analysis and its contribution is therefore neglected. For the lowest mass point, \(m_{A}=150\) GeV, its estimated contribution is \(\sim 10\,\%\), yielding a conservative estimate of the discovery potential when neglecting it.2

Footnote 2: The selection efficiency of the \(h\) due to the lepton \(p_{\rm T}\) threshold is also expected to be reduced with respect to the heavier \(A/H\) due to softer decay products.

### Background processes

The following background processes are relevant and have been considered in this analysis:

* \(Z\)+jets: The production of \(Z\) bosons and their subsequent decay into a pair of leptons constitutes an important source of background in particular at low Higgs boson masses. The production cross section has been calculated to NNLO accuracy [6, 7] and is found to be \(\sigma_{Z+\rm jets}=(2015\pm 60)\)pb3. Footnote 3: The cross section is given for a restriction on the invariant mass of the lepton pair of more than 60 GeV.
* \(t\bar{t}\) production: This background is dominant in the \(b\)-tagged analysis for Higgs boson masses above \(m_{A}=200\) GeV. The cross section for this process has been calculated at NLO+NLL accuracy and is found to be \(\sigma_{t\bar{t}}=(833\pm 100)\) pb.
* \(W\)+jets production: The production cross section for this process has been calculated at NNLO accuracy and is found to be \(\sigma_{W+\rm jets}=20\,510\) pb[6]. A 3% uncertainty is assumed on this cross section.
* QCD di-jet processes: In addition to generic QCD di-jet samples, samples filtered for events containing light leptons (\(e\) or \(\mu\)), and samples with enriched \(b\)-quark content have been generated. All

QCD samples are generated in bins of the momentum transfer in the hard process, \(Q^{2}\). The total cross section assumed is \(\sigma_{\rm QCD}=102\,\mu\)b for processes with \(Q^{2}>35\,\GeV\).
* Single-top processes: Samples containing the \(Wt\) and the \(t\)-channel production of single top quarks are used. The \(s\) channel production is found to be negligible in this analysis. In the \(Wt\) sample, one \(W\) always decays leptonically and the other hadronically. The cross section times branching fraction is \(\sigma_{Wt}\times\mathcal{B}=(25.5\pm 0.8)\) pb [8]. The cross section times branching fraction for the \(t\)-channel process is \(\sigma_{t-\rm channel}\times\mathcal{B}=(81.3\pm 4.0)\) pb [9].

### Event generation

The Monte Carlo samples were generated using Sherpa[10] for the signal samples involving \(b\)-associated Higgs boson production and for the \(W\)+jets and \(Z\)+jets backgrounds. The Monte Carlo generator Pythia[11] was used for gluon-fusion processes and for all QCD di-jet samples. For the production of the single-top samples AcerMC[12] was used, while the \(t\bar{t}\) samples were generated using MC@NLO[13]. Except for the samples generated with Sherpa, all external matrix-element generators are interfaced to Herwig to produce the parton shower. The \(\tau\) leptons are decayed using either Sherpa or Tauola[14]. In all samples except the ones generated with Sherpa, initial- and final-state radiation of photons is simulated using Photos[15].

Where appropriate, a light lepton (\(e\) or \(\mu\)) with \(p_{\rm T}>15\) and \(|\eta|<2.7\) was required at generator level in order to increase the effective size of the samples. For a reliable estimation of the \(Z(\to\tau\tau)\)+jets background, dedicated samples with a generator-level cut on the di-\(\tau\) invariant mass of \(150<m_{\tau\tau}<250\) and \(m_{\tau\tau}>250\) were generated.

All samples have been processed using the fast simulation of the ATLAS detector, ATLFAST-II. The trigger menu used in this analysis corresponds to an instantaneous luminosity of \(10^{33}\) cm\({}^{-2}\) s\({}^{-1}\).

## 3 Object reconstruction, identification and trigger

This section describes the triggers and the preselection of reconstructed physics objects used in this analysis.

Single light-lepton (\(e\) or \(\mu\)) triggers are used with an \(E_{\rm T}\) threshold of \(20\). This is the lowest possible energy threshold available for a single light-lepton trigger at an instantaneous luminosity of \(10^{33}\) cm\({}^{-2}\)s\({}^{-1}\) without pre-scaling. The electron trigger has an additional isolation requirement to cope with the rate at high instantaneous luminosities.

The turn-on curves both for the electron trigger and the muon trigger as a function of \(p_{\rm T}\) are displayed in Fig. 1. They show the expected threshold behavior with a plateau of the trigger efficiency at \(\sim 98\%\) and \(\sim 81\%\) for electrons and muons, respectively.

The preselection of the physics objects proceeds as follows:

* Muon preselection: Muons are selected that are reconstructed by the STACO algorithm [2] which combines reconstructed tracks in the inner detector and in the muon spectrometer. It is required that such a track match has been found with \(\chi^{2}/{\rm NDF}<8\). Furthermore, the muon is required to have \(p_{\rm T}>24\) and be within the pseudorapidity range of \(|\eta|<2.5\). Calorimeter-based and track-based isolation criteria are applied: The energy deposited in a cone of \(\Delta R<0.2\) around the muon track divided by its \(p_{\rm T}\) has to be less than 0.1, and muon candidates with more than one additional track with \(p_{\rm T}>1\) within a cone of \(\Delta R=0.3\) around the muon track are rejected.

* Electron preselection: Electron candidates are reconstructed by matching a track of \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>0.5\) GeV with a calorimeter cluster obtained using a sliding-window technique. In order to suppress electrons from conversions and from QCD jets, each electron candidate is subjected to a medium-level identification procedure [2]. The electron candidate has to satisfy \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>24\) GeV and be within \(|\eta|<2.5\). The same calorimeter-based and track-based isolation criteria are required as for muons.
* Tau-lepton preselection: The preselection of \(\tau\) candidates proceeds in two steps. A 'loose' preselection is defined which requires that the \(\tau\) candidate be reconstructed with both the track-seeded and the calorimeter-seeded algorithms [16], and satisfies \(E_{\mathrm{T}}>24\) GeV and \(|\eta|<2.5\). It is further required that the net charge of the candidate be \(\pm 1\) and that it passes dedicated veto-algorithms against electrons and muons [2]. In addition, a 'tight' preselection is defined which requires that the \(\tau\) candidate has exactly one or three tracks. Furthermore, in order to discriminate against QCD jets, a likelihood discriminator built from calorimetric and tracking variables is used. These two levels of preselection are the basis for the event-weighting procedure necessary to cope with the limited size of the available Monte Carlo samples. The event-weighting procedure is described in Section 4.
* Jet preselection: Jets are reconstructed with a cone-based algorithm operating on electromagnetic clusters with an opening angle of \(\Delta R=0.4\). They are required to have \(E_{\mathrm{T}}>20\) GeV and be within \(|\eta|<5.0\). Jets originating from \(b\) quarks are identified by requiring a discriminating variable computed from track impact-parameter significances and information from inclusively reconstructed secondary

Figure 1: Trigger efficiency as a function of \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) for electrons (left) and muons (right). For the extraction of the trigger efficiency, a Gaussian error function is fit to the data. In the plateau region, a trigger efficiency of \(\sim 98\%\) (\(\sim 81\%\)) for electrons (muons) is obtained.

vertices to exceed a certain value [2]. The value chosen in this analysis depends on the Higgs boson mass hypothesis and corresponds to an average \(b\)-tagging efficiency of \(\sim 60\%\) and a misidentification probability of \(\sim 1\%\).

The fact that the same object can be successfully reconstructed by more than one of the above mentioned algorithms leads to an ambiguity. This ambiguity is resolved by removing candidates that overlap with each other within \(\Delta R=0.2\) in the following order: muons, electrons, \(\tau\) leptons, and finally jets.

The missing transverse energy in the event is calculated from energy deposits in all calorimeter cells associated with reconstructed clusters and from the momenta of reconstructed muons [2]. A correction is applied for the energy loss in the cryostat. To improve both the energy scale and resolution, a calibration is applied to calorimeter cells which depends on the kind of reconstructed object (electron, \(\tau\), jet, or muon) it belongs to.

## 4 Event selection

The main backgrounds in this analysis are due to QCD di-jet, \(t\bar{t}\), \(W+\)jets and \(Z+\)jets processes, where for the latter two the \(W/Z\) bosons decay leptonically. The event selection aims at an effective suppression of these backgrounds. For the signal, in addition to \(b\)-associated production also gluon-fusion processes contribute at low Higgs boson masses (\(\sim 150-300\) GeV). Since no \(b\) quarks are expected in gluon-fusion processes the event selection is split into events with and without tagged \(b\) jets. This leads to a clear separation of the dominant background processes, which is exploited to increase the sensitivity of the analysis. To cover a large range in \(m_{A}\), the analysis is performed for six Higgs boson mass hypotheses: \(m_{A}=150\), \(200\), \(300\), \(450\), \(600\), \(800\) GeV.

The event selection proceeds in two steps. First a common baseline selection is applied. In a second step backgrounds are further suppressed based on selection criteria on kinematic variables, which are optimized separately for the \(b\)-tagged and non-\(b\)-tagged analyses and for the various Higgs boson mass hypotheses.

### Baseline selection

The following criteria are used in the baseline selection:

* Lepton preselection: The trigger selection based on an electron or muon trigger, as described in Section 3, is applied. Events must fulfill the following requirements for charged lepton candidates:
* A veto against events with two charged leptons with an invariant di-lepton mass consistent with the \(Z\) mass is applied to reject \(Z\to\ell^{+}\ell^{-}\) events. For this veto all combinations of \(e^{+}e^{-}\) and \(\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\) pairs are considered with electrons or muons passing loose identification criteria. The event is discarded if a such a pair is found with an invariant mass in the range \((91\pm 10)\) GeV.
* At least one isolated lepton candidate is required in the event that passes the tight electron or muon identification criteria. The lepton with the highest transverse momentum is chosen as the one from the Higgs boson. Due to the potential presence of semileptonic \(b\) decays in signal events, this charged-lepton selection has a higher signal efficiency (by about \(6/11/17\%\) for Higgs boson masses of \(150/300/800\) GeV) than a selection requiring exactly one charged lepton.
* Missing transverse energy: A missing transverse energy of \(E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}>20\) GeV is required in order to suppress background from QCD processes where missing transverse energy is due to mismeasurement of the energy of jets in the detector and fake or missing muons. In addition, the \(E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}\) requirement suppresses backgrounds from \(Z\to ee\) and \(Z\to\mu\mu\) processes and reduces \(Z(\to\tau\tau)\)+jets background for which less missing transverse energy is expected than for signal events.
* Transverse mass: The transverse mass of the system consisting of the highest-\(p_{\rm T}\) isolated light lepton and the missing transverse energy, \(m_{\rm T}(\ell,E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss})\), is required to be less than 25 GeV. This criterion reduces backgrounds containing \(W\) bosons such as \(t\bar{t}\) and \(W\)+jets backgrounds.
* Tau-lepton candidate: Exactly one \(\tau\) candidate which decays hadronically and passes the tight identification criteria is required in the event (\(n_{\tau}=1\)). This requirement significantly reduces all backgrounds without real \(\tau\) leptons.
* Invariant mass: The invariant mass of the Higgs boson candidate is reconstructed in the collinear approximation [17]. In this approximation the masses of the particles involved in the decay of the \(\tau\) lepton are small compared to their momenta, so that the direction of the \(\tau\) lepton can be approximated by the direction of its visible decay products. It is also assumed that the missing energy observed in the event is entirely due to neutrinos from the \(\tau\)-lepton decay. In addition, the Higgs boson is required to have some amount of transverse momentum. If that is not the case, the two \(\tau\) leptons from the Higgs-boson decay are back-to-back in the transverse plane. An accurate reconstruction of the transverse momenta of the \(\tau\) leptons is not possible in that case and the resolution of the invariant mass of the \(\tau\) pair will be poor. Neglecting the masses of all leptons, the invariant mass of the Higgs-boson candidate can be reconstructed via \[m_{\tau^{+}\tau^{-}}=\frac{m_{\ell h}}{\sqrt{x_{1}x_{2}}},\] (1) where \(m_{\ell h}\) is the invariant mass of the charged light lepton \(\ell\) from the leptonic \(\tau\) decay and the hadrons \(h\) from the hadronic \(\tau\) decay, and \(x_{i}=p_{{\rm T},\,\ell_{i}}/p_{{\rm T},\,\tau_{i}}\) is the fraction of the momentum of the \(i^{\rm th}\)\(\tau\) candidate carried by its visible decay products. The quantities \(x_{1}\) and \(x_{2}\) are calculated from the \(E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}\) in the event and the transverse momenta of the visible \(\tau\) decay products. For this calculation, \(E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}\) is decomposed into two components, each of them pointing along the direction of the visible decay products of the \(\tau\) lepton. The fractions \(x_{1}\) and \(x_{2}\) are required to be within physical bounds (\(0<x_{1},x_{2}<1\)). For the solution to be numerically stable, a restriction on the angle between the visible decay products of the \(\tau\) lepton is imposed (see Section 4.2). This also improves the invariant \(m_{\tau\tau}\) resolution. If a semileptonic \(b\) decay is present in the event, the \(m_{\tau\tau}\) mass resolution is degraded since \(E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}\) no longer exclusively comes from the invisible decay products of the \(\tau\) leptons, which is one of the basic assumptions of the collinear approximation.
* Opposite charges: The reconstructed \(\tau\) candidate and the electron or muon are required to have opposite charges to reduce backgrounds where the lepton charges are uncorrelated such as background from QCD processes.

### Analysis-dependent selection

After the baseline selection, the event sample is split into a non-\(b\)-tagged (\(n_{b-{\rm tags}}=0\)) and a \(b\)-tagged (\(n_{b-{\rm tags}}>0\)) sample, which are analyzed separately. For the non-\(b\)-tagged analysis, the \(\tau\) candidate is required to have exactly one track (1-prong) for all Higgs boson mass hypotheses with \(m_{A}\geq 300\) GeV, since for high masses the \(\tau\) jets are narrow and the number of fake multi-prong \(\tau\) candidates from QCDprocesses is increased. In the \(b\)-tagged analysis this requirement is not enforced since the dominant background originates from \(Z(\to\tau\tau)+\)jets and \(t\bar{t}\) processes which contain real \(\tau\) leptons. To reduce the large \(t\bar{t}\) background in the \(b\)-tagged analysis, all events with more than three jets, excluding the \(\tau\) jet, are rejected.

For further background suppression, an additional kinematic selection based on the three variables \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\), \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\tau}\) and \(\Delta\Phi_{\ell,\,\tau}\) is performed. Here \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\tau}\) is the transverse energy of the \(\tau\) candidate and \(\Delta\Phi_{\ell,\,\tau}\) denotes the angle between the charged lepton and the \(\tau\) candidate in the transverse plane. The latter cut is necessary in order to ensure numerically stable results when calculating the invariant \(m_{\tau\tau}\) mass using the collinear approximation. This selection is optimized separately for the various mass hypotheses and for the \(b\)-tagged and non-\(b\)-tagged analyses in an iterative procedure. The best selection criterion for each of the three variables is found by maximising the statistical significance \(S=N_{S}/\sqrt{N_{B}}\), where \(N_{S}\) and \(N_{B}\) are the numbers of selected signal and background events, respectively, after the selection criteria on all other variables have been applied. 4) The optimization results in harsher \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\) and \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\tau}\) criteria for increasing Higgs boson masses, as expected. For \(\Delta\Phi_{\ell,\,\tau}\) both an upper and a lower selection cut have been considered for the \(b\)-tagged analysis. The results of the optimization are shown in Fig. 2 for \(m_{A}=300\,\) GeV. The chosen selection criteria are indicated as solid lines.

Footnote 4: For the two mass hypotheses \(m_{A}=600\,\) GeV and \(m_{A}=800\,\) GeV the number of expected events for an integrated luminosity of \(30\,\mathrm{fb}^{-1}\) is very low. This has been taken into account by either assuming Poisson statistics in the significance calculation, \(S^{2}=2\cdot\left(\left(N_{\mathrm{S}}+N_{\mathrm{B}}\right)\cdot\log\left(1+ \frac{N_{\mathrm{S}}}{N_{\mathrm{B}}}\right)-N_{\mathrm{S}}\right)\), or by loosening the selection criteria.

As a final selection step, mass windows are chosen for each mass point. They are obtained by fitting the \(m_{\tau^{+}\tau^{-}}\) distribution for simulated signal events with a Gaussian function. The window size is defined as \(\left(\mu-1.5\sigma,\,\mu+1.5\sigma\right)\), where \(\mu\) is the mean and \(\sigma\) is the standard deviation of the fitted Gaussian function. Tables 7 through 12 in the appendix give an overview of the event selection for all mass points.

The evaluation of the backgrounds in the \(H/A\to\tau\tau\to\ell h\) channel is limited by the size of the simulated Monte Carlo samples. To increase the statistical precision of the selected event samples, an 'object-weighting' technique is used in this analysis. Instead of applying the full (tight) identification

The chosen selection cuts are shown as horizontal black lines.

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:9]

* The uncertainties on the energy scale and resolution of the reconstructed \(\tau\) leptons are expected to be of the same order as those for jets, i.e. \(\pm\)3% and 45%, respectively.
* The variations applied to the individual objects were propagated to the \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\) vector. Since the energy scale of jets and \(\tau\) leptons is highly correlated and such a scale is not used in the \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\) calculation, only 5% of that variation was propagated to the uncertainty on \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\).

Given the limited size of the available Monte Carlo samples, dedicated procedures have been developed to deal with the systematic uncertainties on the efficiency, the energy scale and resolution, and on \(b\) tagging. The general procedure adopted is to evaluate the impact of a given systematic variation at various stages during the cut flow, in order to determine which selection criteria cause statistically significant systematic effects. In addition, as a cross-check, the order of the cuts are changed with respect to the default analysis and the procedure is repeated.

* Systematic uncertainty on efficiency: Little correlation was observed when randomly removing particles at any point of the event selection. For QCD di-jet events the requirement of lepton isolation is observed to have the largest impact. For all other samples the requirement of lepton isolation is found to be almost independent of where in the selection procedure the selection criterion is applied. A similar behavior is observed in the \(\tau\) efficiency systematic variation after the \(\tau\)-identification criteria have been applied.
* Systematic uncertainty of \(b\) tagging efficiency: In order to estimate the systematic uncertainty on \(b\) tagging on the analysis, its impact has been evaluated at several stages of the analysis. These are denoted'start' before the event selection is applied, '\(\tau\)-ID' after the \(\tau\) identification is applied, and'split' after the analysis is split up into the \(b\)-tagged and non-\(b\)-tagged parts. Good agreement is found for the two stages where the \(\tau\) identification is applied and where the analysis is split. Since the same correlation is observed in all samples the systematic variations are evaluated at the stage where the \(\tau\) identification is applied.
* Systematic uncertainties on energy scale and resolution: The impact of the systematic uncertainties on the energy scale and resolution for limited Monte Carlo statistics is studied with the following techniques: trends in samples with higher statistics are studied and used as guidance for evaluating samples with lower statistics. Selection criteria are loosened in very low-statistics samples to identify the main sources of variation. The order

* Systematic uncertainty on integrated luminosity: A systematic uncertainty of 3% on the integrated luminosity is assumed and propagated to the final result.

## 6 Background estimation

A reliable estimation of backgrounds, both their normalisations and shapes, is an important part of this analysis. Methods to estimate the \(W\)+jets, \(Z\)+jets, \(t\bar{t}\) and QCD backgrounds from data have been developed and are presented in this section. Before the discussion of data-driven methods, this section starts with a brief description of the treatment of single-top background, for which only insufficient Monte Carlo simulated samples were available.

### Estimation of single-top background from simulation

Although the cross-section for single-top-quark processes is small, it might still constitute a non-negligible background in the \(b\)-tagged analysis. As described in Section 2, only the \(Wt\) and the \(t\)-channel contribute in this analysis. Since only very small simulated samples for single-top production were available, in particular for the \(Wt\) channel, this background is estimated by factorising the \(b\)-tagging and tight \(\tau\)-identification efficiencies and the efficiency of the \(m_{\mathrm{T}}\) requirement. They are applied as weights.

With this procedure, the single-top contribution in the \(b\)-tagged analysis is estimated to be \(10/7/3\%\) of the \(t\bar{t}\) background for Higgs boson masses of \(m_{A}=150/200/300\)  and is found to be negligible for \(m_{A}>450\). It is incorporated in the analysis by scaling up the \(t\bar{t}\) accepted cross section accordingly. In order to take into account uncertainties due to factorisation of selection criteria, the single-top contribution is increased by an additional 50% to be conservative.

### Estimation of \(W\)+jets background

In the non-\(b\)-tagged analysis, \(W\)+jets processes constitute a significant background contribution. They can be estimated from data by selecting a 'control region' that contains a large and very pure sample of events with a \(W\) boson. The number of \(W\)+jets events in the'signal region', defined by the selection criteria used in the analysis, can then be estimated from the number of events in the control region as

\[N_{W}^{\mathrm{signal}}=R\cdot N_{W}^{\mathrm{control}}, \tag{2}\]

if the ratio \(R\) of \(W\)+jets events in the signal and control regions is known. In this analysis, the value of \(R\) is estimated from Monte Carlo simulation as no method for its determination from data has been developed so far. It varies from 0 to 2% depending on the Higgs boson mass, with a relative uncertainty of \((3-7)\%\).

The selection of the control sample uses the baseline selection described in Section 4 to obtain similar regions of phase space for control and signal regions. However, two of the baseline selection criteria are modified:* Instead of suppressing \(W\)+jets events with the \(m_{\mathrm{T}}<25\)\(\mathrm{\,Ge\kern-1.0ptV}\) requirement, the transverse mass is required to be in the range \(60<m_{\mathrm{T}}<90\)\(\mathrm{\,Ge\kern-1.0ptV}\) to actively select events with \(W\) bosons.
* The \(m_{\tau\tau}>0\) requirement is removed. There is a large correlation between \(m_{\tau\tau}\) and \(m_{\mathrm{T}}\) for \(W\)+jets events. The collinear approximation used in the mass reconstruction assumes that the neutrinos are in the same direction as the visible \(\tau\) decay products. To obtain a physical solution, the missing energy vector must lie in between the visible \(\tau\) and lepton vectors in the transverse plane. In \(W\)+jets events the neutrino and lepton tend to be in the same hemisphere with a recoiling jet misidentified as a \(\tau\) candidate. For signal, the \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\) vector and the \(\tau\) decay products share the same hemisphere in roughly half of the events, whereas for \(W\)+jets they occupy opposite hemispheres in almost all the events. This means that in most of the \(W\)+jets events a physical \(m_{\tau\tau}\) cannot be reconstructed.

The further analysis-dependent selection from Section 4 is not applied since especially the \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\) and \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\tau}\) criteria remove a large fraction of \(W\)+jets events.

Figure 3 shows the transverse-mass distribution in the control region (left) and the \(m_{\tau\tau}\) distributions for the signal and control regions (right), which show a reasonable agreement.

The control sample contains 336 100 events and the \(W\)+jets purity is 93%. The background contamination is mostly due to \(t\bar{t}\) events (\(\sim 4\%\) of the control sample) and needs to be subtracted. Therefore, a second control region is defined with an enhanced fraction of \(t\bar{t}\) events to estimate this background contribution. The enhancement of the \(t\bar{t}\) contribution is achieved by requiring two \(b\) jets in the event instead of none. The \(b\)-tagging efficiency will be measured very accurately in analyses of top-quark samples and the ratio of \(t\bar{t}\) events with \(n_{b-\mathrm{jet}}=0\) and \(n_{b-\mathrm{jet}}=2\) is expected to be known with high precision. The resulting \(t\bar{t}\) control sample has a high purity of 99%. The effect of single-top background on the

\(W\)+jets estimation is found to be negligible. The remaining contamination of the \(W\)+jets control sample is due to \(Z\to\ell\ell\) events where one lepton escapes detection. This contamination leads to a 4% bias on the estimated number of \(W\)+jets events in the signal region.

The systematic uncertainties from the sources described in Section 5 have been studied and added in quadrature. Table 4 shows the resulting total systematic uncertainty for each Higgs boson mass hypothesis, including an uncertainty corresponding to the 4% bias. The dominant contributions to the systematic uncertainty are due to the uncertainties on the jet and \(\tau\) energy scales and resolutions. The statistical uncertainty is negligible. The \(W\)+jets background can be estimated from data with a precision of \((5-9)\)% over the whole Higgs boson mass range under study.

### Estimation of QCD background

The QCD background can be estimated from data by counting the number of events passing the event selection where the \(\tau\) candidate and the light lepton have the same charge. The ratio of opposite-sign (OS) to same-sign (SS) events is expected to be close to unity for QCD processes, while for signal processes only opposite-sign events are expected.

A sample of same-sign events with a negligible signal contribution is selected. The contribution from other backgrounds can be estimated from Monte Carlo simulation or from data-driven methods and is subtracted from the total number of same-sign events in data, \(n_{\rm DATA}^{\rm SS}\). The number of same-sign events from QCD processes, \(n_{\rm QCD}^{\rm SS}\), is then calculated via:

\[n_{\rm QCD}^{\rm SS}=n_{\rm DATA}^{\rm SS}-\sum_{i}n_{i}^{\rm SS}\,, \tag{3}\]

where the index \(i\) runs over all backgrounds except for QCD background. The number of (opposite-sign) QCD background events in the main analysis is estimated using the ratio of opposite-sign to same-sign events for QCD processes, \(R^{\rm OS/SS}\):

\[n_{\rm QCD}^{\rm OS}=R^{\rm OS/SS}\cdot n_{\rm QCD}^{\rm SS}. \tag{4}\]

The value of \(R^{\rm OS/SS}\) is determined from Monte Carlo simulation and amounts to \(1.2\pm 0.1\). This value will need to be verified with data. Due to the very small amount of QCD background in the analysis this background estimate has a quite large fractional uncertainty. However, its impact on the measured signal is small compared to the dominant backgrounds.

### Estimation of \(Z\to\tau\tau\)+jets background

The \(Z(\to\tau\tau)\)+jets background is particularly important in the analysis of low Higgs boson masses. A data-driven method to estimate that background has been studied. This method is based on the selection of high-purity and high-statistics \(Z\to\ell\ell\) control samples and a rescaling of the kinematics of the light leptons.

Control samples of \(Z\to ee\) and \(Z\to\mu\mu\) decays satisfying the same identification and \(p_{\rm T}\) requirements as in the main analysis are selected. A very clean sample with a purity of 99.8% is obtained by requiring an invariant di-lepton mass in the range \(75<m_{\ell\ell}<100\) GeV. In addition, events with more than three jets are rejected.

The shape of the \(Z\to\tau\tau\) background distribution is estimated by rescaling the four-vectors of the light leptons in the \(Z\to\ell\ell\) control samples to match the kinematics of \(\tau\) leptons from \(Z\to\tau\tau\) decays. As input to the rescaling method, reference histograms from a loose selection of \(Z\to\tau\tau\) events are used in which a light lepton and a hadronically decaying \(\tau\) lepton with opposite charges are reconstructed and truth-matched. These histograms show the visible energy of the hadronically decaying \(\tau\) candidate versus that of the light lepton, measured in the \(Z\)-boson rest frame, and encode both the \(\tau\) decay kinematics and the energy resolution of the final-state particles. The reference histograms are produced separately for electrons and muons and, in order to account for varying decay kinematics, they are divided into five equally spaced bins of \(|\cos\theta_{\rm GJ}|\), where the Gottfried-Jackson angle \(\theta_{\rm GJ}\)[18] is the angle between the negatively charged \(\tau\) lepton in the \(Z\) boson rest-frame and the direction of flight of the \(Z\) boson in the lab-frame. An example reference histogram for one of the \(\theta_{\rm GJ}\) bins is shown in Fig. 4 (left).

After rescaling of the light-lepton four-vectors, the missing transverse energy in the event is recalculated and the full event selection of the main analysis is applied, except for \(\tau\) reconstruction and identification.

Most of the rescaled \(Z\to\ell\ell\) distributions show a reasonable agreement with those for the \(Z\to\tau\tau\) sample within statistical uncertainties. Figure 4 (right) shows the \(m_{\tau\tau}\) distribution for the electron channel illustrating the results of the rescaling method.

The normalisation of the \(Z\to\tau\tau\) background is estimated from a double ratio of event numbers in the control and signal regions. Since the final-state topology is different before and after rescaling, the normalisation procedure must account for differences in efficiency between a light lepton in the control sample and a hadronic \(\tau\) decay in the signal region. A first-order correction is applied to the background normalization of the form \(\varepsilon_{\tau}/\varepsilon_{\ell}\) with efficiencies \(\varepsilon_{\tau}\) and \(\varepsilon_{\ell}\) computed in \(Z\to\tau\tau\) events.

The systematic uncertainties from detector effects described in Section 5 have been evaluated. The total uncertainty is found to be significantly larger than 20% for most of the Higgs boson mass hypotheses and is dominated by the uncertainty on the \(\tau\) energy scale. The large systematic uncertainty is mostly due to the effect of the limited number of events in the simulated reference and control samples on the systematic error estimation. For this reason the results of the \(Z\to\tau\tau\) estimation method are not used in the determination of the discovery potential for this analysis. Instead, the uncertainty on the \(Z\to\tau\tau\) background is taken from Monte Carlo simulation. Nevertheless, with larger event samples the proposed data-driven method is expected to significantly reduce systematic uncertainties related to \(Z\) production and the underlying event composition.

### Estimation of \(t\bar{t}\) background

Events from \(t\bar{t}\) processes constitute a major background in the \(b\)-tagged analysis in particular for Higgs boson mass hypotheses \(m_{A}>200\)\(\mathrm{GeV}\). Therefore, a procedure to estimate this background directly from data has been developed based on the observed jet multiplicity in the event. Signal events from \(b\)-associated processes have equal proportions of one-jet and two-jet events while in general higher jet

Figure 4: Left: \(Z\to\tau\tau\) reference histogram showing the visible energy of the hadronically decaying \(\tau\) lepton versus that of the light lepton in the \(Z\)-boson rest frame, for \(0.2<|\cos\theta_{\rm GJ}|<0.4\). Right: Invariant \(m_{\tau\tau}\) distribution for \(Z\to\tau\tau\) events (shaded rectangles) compared with \(Z\to ee\) events after rescaling (points with error bars).

multiplicities are observed in \(t\bar{t}\) events.

The control region in jet multiplicity is selected such that it contains little contamination from other background processes and from Higgs boson signal events and that the jet-multiplicity distribution resembles the one in the signal region as closely as possible. The selection of the control region proceeds as follows:

* The missing energy in the event is required to be above \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}>100\,\GeV\).
* The selection criterion on the transverse mass, as calculated from \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\) and the momentum of the light lepton, the visible mass, and the selection criterion on the \(E_{\mathrm{T}}\) of the \(b\) jet are optimized separately for each Higgs boson mass hypothesis.
* The requirement on lepton isolation is dropped which reduces the relative contribution from \(W\to\ell\nu\) in the control region.
* The requirements imposed by the collinear approximation are dropped as is the \(m_{\tau\tau}\) mass-window requirement.

After this selection the purity of \(t\bar{t}\) events in the control region is between 94% for \(m_{A}=150\,\GeV\) and 98% for \(m_{A}=450\,\GeV\). For Higgs boson mass hypotheses \(m_{A}>450\,\GeV\) the available statistics expected in 30 fb\({}^{-1}\) is too low for this procedure to be applied. The distribution of the jet multiplicity in the control region is displayed in Fig. 5 (left) for the analysis with a Higgs boson mass hypothesis of \(m_{A}=300\,\GeV\).

Figure 5: Jet multiplicity distribution in the control region (left) and in the signal region (right). In the control region a high purity of \(t\bar{t}\) events is observed. Good agreement between the predicted and the observed number of \(t\bar{t}\) events is achieved in the signal region, in particular for the one-jet and the two-jet bins relevant to this analysis.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{l c c c c} \hline \hline \(m_{A}\) [GeV] & 150 & 200 & 300 & 450 \\ \hline Systematic uncertainty [\% ] & 11.6 & 12.8 & 12.6 & 12 \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}

The contribution from \(t\bar{t}\) events in the signal region is now estimated by calculating the double ratio

\[N_{t\bar{t},\,\text{signal region}}^{\text{njets}=1||2}=N_{t\bar{t},\,\text{ control region}}^{\text{njets}=1||2}\cdot\frac{N_{t\bar{t},\,\text{signal region}}^{\text{njets}>3}}{N_{t\bar{t},\,\text{control region}}^{\text{njets}>3}}, \tag{5}\]

where the normalisation is obtained from jet-multiplicity bins of four and higher.

The distribution of the jet multiplicity in the signal region is displayed in Fig. 5 (right) for a Higgs boson mass hypothesis of \(m_{A}=300\)\(\text{GeV}\). Good agreement is achieved between the predicted and the observed numbers of events in the one-jet and two-jet bin relevant for this analysis.

The systematic uncertainties from the sources described in Section 5 are studied. The contributions from the individual sources have been added in quadrature and are displayed in Table 5. The dominant contributions to the systematic uncertainty are due to the uncertainties on the \(\tau\) energy scale, resolution and efficiency, the jet energy scale and the light-jet rejection.

## 7 Results

The distributions of the invariant \(m_{\tau\tau}\) mass are displayed in Figs. 7 through 12 for the \(b\)-tagged and the non-\(b\)-tagged analyses. A detailed overview of the selection ('cut-flow') for both analyses is given in Tables 7 through 12. For the non-\(b\)-tagged analysis the background is dominated by \(W\)+jets and \(Z\)+jets processes. The contribution from \(t\bar{t}\) becomes more important with increasing Higgs boson mass. The background in the \(b\)-tagged analysis is dominated by \(t\bar{t}\) processes over the full \(m_{A}\) range.

In order to assess the discovery potential for MSSM Higgs bosons the \(b\)-tagged and the non-\(b\)-tagged analyses are combined by using a profile likelihood method [19]. Systematic uncertainties have been included using two approaches. In the first approach all contributions to the systematic uncertainties are assumed to be fully correlated, therefore leading to a conservative estimate of the discovery potential. In the second approach all systematic uncertainties are assumed to be uncorrelated. The discovery potential

in the \(m_{h}^{\rm max}\) scenario as a function of \(m_{A}\) and \(\tan\beta\) is displayed in Fig. 6 and summarised in Table 6 for the \(b\)-tagged (upper part) and the non-\(b\)-tagged (lower part) analyses, respectively. The two approaches for the treatment of systematic uncertainties are displayed as solid line and dash-dotted line, respectively. Only little variation in the discovery potential is observed for the two approaches. In addition, the results of the analysis of the fully-leptonic channel described in detail in [2] are overlaid.

For low Higgs boson masses up to \(m_{A}=150\)  GeV the discovery potential is dominated by the results from the fully-leptonic channel and a five-\(\sigma\) discovery can be achieved for values of \(\tan\beta\) as low as \(\sim 10\). For higher Higgs boson masses, the result is dominated by the lepton-hadron channel. For the highest Higgs boson mass a five-\(\sigma\) discovery is only possible for values of \(\tan\beta\) as high as \(\sim 40\).

This study has been carried out without including effects from pile-up and cavern background. Previous studies suggest that the influence of low-luminosity pile-up up to instantaneous luminosities of \(10^{33}\,{\rm cm}^{-2}\,{\rm s}^{-1}\) does not lead to a significant degradation of the discovery potential for this analysis. Their effect on the purity of the selected samples can be reduced by tightening the cut on the likelihood selector. In addition, the expected degradation in the \(m_{\tau\tau}\) mass resolution due to the \(E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}\) resolution is small.

Figure 6: The five-\(\sigma\) discovery potential as a function of \(\tan\beta\) and \(m_{A}\). The solid green line is the result of the lepton-hadron analysis. The dashed green lines indicates the effect of the theoretical uncertainty on the signal cross section. The red line gives the results for the fully correlated treatment of systematic uncertainties. The dash-dotted black line shows the discovery potential without inclusion of systematic uncertainties for comparison with previous results. The results from the lepton-lepton analysis are superimposed as blue lines. The solid line indicates the result including only experimental systematic uncertainties and the dashed line indicates the result including a 10% theoretical uncertainty on the \(t\bar{t}\) cross-section.
