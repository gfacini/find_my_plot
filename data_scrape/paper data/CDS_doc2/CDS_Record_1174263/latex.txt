Introduction

A variety of interesting physics processes at LHC, such as the \(H\to b\bar{b}\) decay for an intermediate Higgs boson mass range, top physics or searches for new physics require efficient identification of \(b\)-quarks. The performance of \(b\)-tagging algorithms in ATLAS are studied in Ref. [1]. The semi-leptonic decays of heavy quarks provide a clean signature used to identify the flavour composition of jets. The semi-leptonic decay modes are \(b\to\ell\), \(c\to\ell\) and the cascade decay \(b\to c\to\ell\). Electrons produced in \(b\) decays (through direct and cascade decays) can be detected using the electromagnetic calorimeter and the inner detector. Since these electrons are non-isolated and with low transverse momentum, excellent electron/hadron separation capability is required. As a \(b\)-flavour tag, the lepton tag is not competitive with the lifetime tag because the branching ratio is low for such decays (about 20% for \(B\)-meson decays to leptons, including cascade decays, per lepton family) and is limited by the efficiency to reconstruct and identify electrons within jets. Still this method can be used with the vertex algorithms to provide a complement to the overall \(b\)-tagging performance and for cross-checks and calibration.

The note is organised as follows. Monte Carlo data samples used in this analysis are described in Section 2. The jet and track selections are described in Section 3. The electron identification algorithm is described in Section 4. The \(b\)-tagging algorithm and its performance are described in Section 5.

## 2 Monte Carlo samples

The samples used in this study contain events with electrons in jets from Higgs boson associated production \(WH\), with \(W\to\mu\nu\). We take the mass of the Higgs boson to be \(m_{H}=120\) GeV. The signal sample consists of \(H\to b\bar{b}\) events and the background sample of \(H\to u\bar{u}\) events. Another sample of \(H\to b\bar{b}\) events is enriched in true electrons with a filter at the generation level. This filter is defined as follows: both \(b\) quarks (before final state radiation, FSR) are required to have a transverse momentum \(p_{T}^{b}>15\) GeV and a pseudorapidity \(|\eta_{b}|<2.5\); at least one true electron with \(p_{T}^{e}>1\) GeV is required to be found in a cone \(\Delta R<0.4\) around each \(b\)-quark direction (before FSR). This sample will be used only in Section 4 to model signal electrons with enough statistics.

All samples have been generated using the PYTHIA 6.403 [2] Monte Carlo event generator. More details on the Monte Carlo generators used can be found in [3]. Data have been passed through a full detector simulation based on GEANT4. No pile-up has been included but its effect on performance, based on previous studies, is mentioned below where relevant.

The signal electrons come from direct (\(b\to e\)) and cascade (\(b\to c\to e\)) semi-leptonic decays of \(B\)-hadrons. Apart from the previous sources, there are also some other sources2, mainly \(b\to\tau\to e\) and \(b\to(J/\psi,\psi^{\prime})\to e^{+}e^{-}\). The background electrons arise from \(\pi^{0}\) Dalitz decays, \(\gamma\)-conversions occurring in the inner detector and decays of light hadrons. The fraction of electrons from photon conversions becomes substantial at large pseudo-rapidities and large transverse momenta.

Footnote 2: The corresponding branching ratios [4] are \(Br(b\to\ell^{-})=(10.71\pm 0.22)\%\), \(Br(b\to c\to\ell^{+})=(8.01\pm 0.18)\%\), \(Br(b\to\bar{c}\to\ell^{-})=(1.62^{+0.44}_{-0.36})\%\), \(Br(b\to\tau\to e)=(0.419\pm 0.055)\%\) and \(Br(b\to(J/\psi,\psi^{\prime})\to e^{+}e^{-})=(0.072\pm 0.006)\%\).

Distributions of true transverse momentum, \(p_{T}\), and pseudo-rapidity, \(\eta\), for electrons and pions are shown in Fig. 1 for the samples considered. Table 1 shows the mean values of the true transverse momentum distributions for signal and background electrons and pions in the two samples.

## 3 Jet and track selection

The reconstruction of the various objects needed for \(b\)-tagging and the estimation of its performance are summarized in this section. The reconstruction of soft electrons will be detailed in the next section.

We follow the default jet reconstruction and labelling procedure described in Ref. [1]. Jets are reconstructed in the calorimeters using a standard cone algorithm with a size of \(\Delta R=0.4\). Jets with \(p_{T}>15\) GeV and \(|\eta|<2.5\) are considered for \(b\)-tagging. To assess quantitatively the \(b\)-tagging performance, Monte-Carlo information is used to determine the type of parton (a quark-based labelling) from which a jet originates. Jets are labelled as \(b\)-jets if a \(b\) quark with \(p_{T}>5\) GeV (after FSR) is found in a cone \(\Delta R=0.3\) around the jet direction. The labelling for \(c\)-jets (and \(\tau\)-jets) is done in the same way. By light jets we denote all other reconstructed jets.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|c|c|c|} \hline sample & \multicolumn{5}{c|}{electrons} & pions \\ \cline{2-6}  & \(B\) hadrons & \(D\) hadrons & \(\gamma\)-conversions and \(\pi^{0}\) Dalitz & other sources & \\ \hline \(H\to b\bar{b}\) & 10.8 & 11.9 & 4.9 & 7.3 & 5.9 \\ \hline \(H\to\mu\bar{u}\) & - & - & 5.2 & 4.2 & 7.1 \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}

Figure 2: Track multiplicity in jets (left) and jet transverse momentum (right) for \(b\) jets (hatched histograms) and light jets (solid line). Only jets having at least one _good quality track_ with \(p_{T}>2\) GeV are considered.

For the soft electron \(b\)-tagging algorithm, a track-based electron reconstruction algorithm is used and will be described in the next section. In order to be able to identify track candidates as electrons, strict track selection criteria are applied and called hereafter _good track quality cuts_. To reduce the number of fake candidates in jets, only tracks with \(p_{T}>2\) GeV are considered. The inner detector coverage extends to pseudo-rapidity values of \(\pm 2.5\), except for the transition radiation tracker (TRT) which extends up to \(\pm 2\). This sub-detector is crucial in the identification procedure, so the track selection requires \(|\eta|<2\). Tracks are required to have at least nine precision hits (pixels and SCT), at least two hits in the pixel detector, at least one hit in the vertexing layer (the so-called \(b\)-layer) and an unsigned transverse impact parameter at the perigee smaller than 1 mm. The TRT may record either of two types of hits, 'low-energy' hits which are used for track reconstruction and 'high-energy' hits which are used for electron identification. Selection criteria thus require at least 20 low-energy hits and at least one high-energy hit in the TRT detector along the track. After this selection, only about 50% of initial tracks remain. About 50% of actual \(b\)-jets and 60% of light jets, in the WH sample, have no _good quality track_ associated. Figure 2 shows the multiplicity of _good quality track_ inside jets and the jet transverse momenta. For jets having at least one _good quality track_ the mean multiplicity is 3.8 (3.3) for \(b\)-jets (light jets). Light jets, which include ISR, FSR and underlying events, have a softer transverse momentum than \(b\) jets, which are originated from the \(H\) decay, with a mean \(p_{T}\) of 51 GeV against 57 GeV, but with a large spread, an RMS of \(\sim\)35 GeV.

The fraction of jets containing electrons with a _good quality track_ is given in Table 2 for signal and background samples.

## 4 Electron reconstruction and identification

The standard electron reconstruction procedure [5] is based on calorimeter clusters, with a subsequent association to tracks. While this method is efficient for high-energy isolated electrons, such as those arising from \(W\) or \(Z\) decays, it is not effective for electrons inside hadronic jets, such as those from semi-leptonic decays. Indeed hadron and electron showers tend to overlap in collimated jets so that electron cluster characteristics are obscured. An alternative procedure takes full advantage of the tracking capabilities of the inner detector as well as the granularity of the electromagnetic calorimeter. The method relies on the extrapolation of reconstructed charged particle trajectories into the electromagnetic calorimeter. The most common background processes for producing electron-like showers in the calorimeters were described in Section 2. Because the development of showers is different for electrons and hadrons, the electron identification algorithm incorporates variables that describe the shower shapes, quality of the match between the track and its corresponding cluster, and the fraction of high-energy hits in the transition radiation tracker. This algorithm is used also for the reconstruction of low \(p_{T}\) electrons in J/\(\psi\) events [6].

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|c|c|} \hline Sample & \(\gamma\)-conversions and \(\pi^{0}\) Dalitz & \(B\) hadrons & \(D\) hadrons & Other sources \\ \hline \(H\to b\bar{b}\) & 1.6 & 3.4 & 2.2 & 0.3 \\ \(H\to u\bar{u}\) & 1.3 & \(<10^{-4}\) & \(<10^{-4}\) & 0.1 \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 2: Fraction of jets (in %) with an electron at the generator level that also have a _good quality track_, for the signal and background samples.

### Electron reconstruction

All the tracks that pass the _good track quality cuts_, described in the previous section, are extrapolated to the second (also known as middle) sampling layer of the electromagnetic calorimeter. Around this position a cluster of size \(\Delta\eta\times\Delta\phi=0.125\times 0.125\) (\(5\times 5\) cells in this sampling layer) is built. The cell with the maximum energy is sought within a small \(\eta\) and \(\phi\) window (\(0.075\times 0.075\)) around the extrapolation point. Shower shapes are estimated with respect to this cell. The contribution of neighbouring hadronic showers is therefore reduced.

A set of _preselection_ criteria are applied to decrease the number of fake candidates per jet:

* The ratio of energy reconstructed in the core of the shower in the first sampling layer to the total shower energy reconstructed in the core of the cluster, must fulfil \(E_{1}({\rm core})/E({\rm core})>\)0.03. \(E_{1}({\rm core})\) is the energy reconstructed in a window of size \(\Delta\eta\times\Delta\phi=0.009375\times 0.1\) in the first sampling layer (\(3\times 1\) cells). \(E({\rm core})\), the core energy in the cluster, is computed in the following windows: \(0.075\times 0.3\) (\(3\times 3\) cells) in the presampler, \(0.046875\times 0.2\) (\(15\times 2\) cells) in the strips, \(0.125\times 0.125\) (\(5\times 5\) cells) in the middle, \(0.15\times 0.125\) (\(3\times 5\) cells) in the back. This ratio tends to be larger for electrons than for hadrons due to the different development of hadronic and electromagnetic showers. This quantity is discussed in detail in the following section.
* Similarly, the fraction of energy reconstructed in the core of the shower in the third sampling layer to the energy reconstructed in the core of the cluster, \(E_{3}({\rm core})/E({\rm core})\), must be smaller than 0.5. \(E_{3}({\rm core})\) is the energy reconstructed in a window of size \(\Delta\eta\times\Delta\phi=0.15\times 0.075\) in the third sampling layer (\(3\times 3\) cells). This ratio is larger for hadrons than it is for low-energy electrons which almost never reach this layer and is discussed in the following section.
* The ratio of the energy \(E\) reconstructed in the electromagnetic calorimeter over the momentum \(p\) of the track reconstructed in the inner detector is required to fulfil \(E/p>\)0.7.

These _preselection_ criteria cut out less than 5% of signal electrons. Finally, candidates which are also reconstructed as originating from a conversion are vetoed, corresponding to a loss of 9% of all signal and background tracks.

Position and energy corrections are applied in the precise reconstruction of the electromagnetic cluster and are described in [7]. These corrections have been tuned for high-energy clusters and are not optimal for low-energy electrons. In Fig. 3 the ratio between the reconstructed and the true electron energies is shown as a function of \(|\eta|\) for signal electrons from the \(H\to b\bar{b}\) sample. It can be seen that the corrections over-estimate the electron energy. Moreover, as electrons are embedded in jets, there is

Figure 3: Ratio between reconstructed and true energy as a function of the electron pseudo-rapidity \(|\eta|\) (left) and ratio of the reconstructed to true momentum for electrons (right).

a contamination from other hadrons in the energy determination which is not visible with the isolated electrons from a J/\(\psi\) sample [6]. Work is on going to improve the energy reconstruction at low energy.

By default the four-momentum of an electron is defined as the energy reconstructed in the calorimeter, whereas the direction is taken from the associated track. Since in this note the main physics processes lead to electron transverse momenta of less than 15 GeV, the momentum measured in the tracker is used instead of the energy unless stated otherwise. The reconstructed momentum of the electron is shown in Fig. 3. The track reconstructs the momentum of the electron close to its true value for most candidates. The small downward shift of the peak from unity and the tail towards lower values are due to photon bremsstrahlung. Future developments in ATLAS will ensure an optimal combination of calorimeter and tracker measurements in the energy definition.

### Electron identification variables

The hadronic calorimeter has a granularity of \(\Delta\eta\times\Delta\phi=0.1\times 0.1\) which is too large to disentangle the energy deposit of an electron inside a jet. In the electromagnetic calorimeter, electrons are narrow objects while jets tend to have a broader profile, allowing a discrimination. For this purpose, we use the finer granularity (\(\Delta\eta\times\Delta\phi=0.05\times 0.025\)) of the third sampling layer of the electromagnetic calorimeter. The ratio \(E_{3}(\mathrm{core})/E(\mathrm{core})\), defined above, is larger for pions than for electrons and is clearly discriminating as can be seen in Fig. 4.

Electromagnetic showers deposit most of their energy in the second sampling layer of the electromagnetic calorimeter. The following variables are used:

* The lateral shower shape \(R_{\eta}\) (cf. Fig. 5 on left) is given by the ratio of the energy reconstructed in a window of size \(0.075\times 0.175\) (\(3\times 7\) cells of the middle sampling layer) to the energy reconstructed in \(0.175\times 0.175\) (\(7\times 7\) cells).
* The lateral width \(\omega_{\eta 2}=\sqrt{\frac{\sum E_{e}\times\eta^{2}}{\sum E_{e}}-\left(\frac{ \sum E_{e}\times\eta}{\sum E_{e}}\right)^{2}}\) (cf. Fig. 5 on right) is calculated in a window of size \(0.075\times 0.125\) (\(3\times 5\) cells of the middle sampling layer) using the energy weighted sum over all cells, which depends on the particle impact point inside the cell.

The first layer, with its very fine granularity in pseudo-rapidity, can be used to detect sub-structures within a shower and thus isolated \(\pi^{0}\)'s and \(\gamma\)'s can be discriminated against efficiently. For all variables computed in the first sampling layer, two cells in \(\phi\) are summed.

Figure 4: Ratio \(E_{3}(\mathrm{core})/E(\mathrm{core})\) (see text) for electrons in the \(H\to b\bar{b}\) sample (hatched histogram) and for charged pions in the \(H\to u\bar{u}\) sample (solid line). The distributions are normalized to unit area.

The ratio \(E_{1}({\rm core})/E({\rm core})\), defined above, is larger for electrons than for hadrons as can be seen in Fig 6.

The lateral shower shape in the strips is now exploited.

* The total shower width in strips \(\omega_{stot}\) is determined in a window \(\Delta\eta=0.0625\) (corresponding to 20 strips in the barrel for instance). It is calculated from: \(\omega_{stot}\ =\ \sqrt{\sum E_{i}\times\left(i-i_{max}\right)^{2}/\sum E_{i}}\), where \(i\) is the strip number and \(i_{max}\) the strip number of the first local maximum. This width is shown for electrons and pions in Fig. 7.
* The shower width using three strips around the one with the maximal energy deposit is shown in Fig. 7 on the right. It is given by the following formula: \(\omega_{i3}=\sqrt{\sum E_{i}\times\left(i-i_{max}\right)^{2}/\sum E_{i}}\), where \(i\) is the number of the strip and \(i_{max}\) the strip number of the most energetic one.

The pion and jet rejection can be significantly improved by ensuring consistency between the electromagnetic calorimeter and the inner detector information.

The distributions are shown for electrons in the \(H\to b\bar{b}\) sample (hatched histograms) and for charged pions in the \(H\to u\bar{u}\) sample (solid lines). The distributions are normalized to unit area.

### Rejection of electrons from \(\gamma\)-conversions and Dalitz decays

A significant source of low-\(p_{T}\) electron tracks in jets are photon conversions and Dalitz decays. Such tracks might be identified by the algorithm as signal electron tracks. The _good quality track_ cuts help in part to suppress that type of background. In case of \(\gamma\)-conversions and Dalitz decays, \(e^{+}e^{-}\) pairs with small invariant mass are observed in the detector. To find them the conversion finding algorithms can be used. Ref. [8] details the last developments on the reconstruction of such electrons. Unfortunately, these were not available for the electron reconstruction algorithms at the time of this study. As detailed in Section 4.1, about 9% of signal electrons are mis-identified as conversions. Based on previous studies [9], for an electron efficiency \(\epsilon_{e}=80\%\), the rejection factor of electrons from conversions and Dalitz decays is \(\sim 3\) with the conversion package and \(\sim 2\) without.

## 5 \(b\)-tagging algorithm

The variables described in the previous section have been shown to be efficient in distinguishing electron tracks from non-electron tracks or electron tracks from \(\gamma\)-conversions and Dalitz decays.

In order to construct a \(b\)-tagging algorithm we combine these variables with additional variables to exploit the specific features of \(b\)-jets. First we take advantage of the fact that the electron is coming from a \(b\) quark and thus can have a significant transverse impact parameter \(d_{0}\). Figure 10 shows the corresponding distributions. In addition, because of the \(B\) hadron's high mass, electrons from direct bottom decays tend to be more boosted in a plane transverse to the jet axis, _i.e._ have a larger \(p_{T}^{rel}\) than the backgrounds, as shown in Fig. 11. \(p_{T}^{rel}\) is defined as the electron momentum in the plane orthogonal to the jet axis.

The combination of all variables is performed in two steps; first for variables independent of the jet and second including a jet dependent variable as explained in Section 5.1. Finally the performance of the algorithm will be detailed in Section 5.2.

### b-tagging procedure

A likelihood-ratio method is used to combine the variables described in the previous section along with the electron track impact parameter \(d_{0}\). This likelihood ratio uses information only on the characteristics

Figure 9: Ratio \(E/p\) between the energy of the electromagnetic clusters and the momentum of reconstructed charged tracks (left) and fraction \(N_{\rm HTR}/N_{\rm straw}\) of high-energy hits in the TRT (right). The distributions are shown for electrons in the \(H\to b\bar{b}\) sample (hatched histograms) and for pions in the \(H\to u\bar{u}\) sample (solid lines). The distributions are normalized to unit area.

of the electron and is independent of the parameters of the jet. The discriminating variables are compared to pre-defined normalized distributions (probability density functions) for both the electron and the pion hypotheses. We use the signal sample of \(H\to b\bar{b}\) filtered for electrons and part of the \(H\to u\bar{u}\) background samples. The variables show a significant dependence on pseudo-rapidity and a less pronounced one on transverse momentum. In \(\eta\) the changes correspond to varying granularities, lead thickness and material in front of the electromagnetic calorimeter. The separation between the distributions obtained for electrons and pions can vary also with \(\eta\). Therefore probability density functions are defined in five \(|\eta|\) bins: (0-0.8), (0.8-1.37), (1.37-1.52), (1.52-1.8), (1.8-2).

For each _good quality_ track the discriminating function \(D_{\rm track}\) is calculated as:

\[D_{\rm track}=\frac{\prod_{i}P_{e}(x_{i})}{\prod_{i}P_{e}(x_{i})+\prod_{i}P_{h}( x_{i})}, \tag{1}\]

where \(x_{i}\) denotes the value of the \(i\)-th variable for a given track, \(P_{e}(x_{i})\) is the probability obtained from the single variable \(x_{i}\) that the track originates from a signal electron, \(P_{h}(x_{i})\) is the probability that the track originates from a hadron, and \(i\) runs through all the variables used by the algorithm. Distributions of \(D_{\rm track}\) obtained for signal electrons and background pions are shown in Fig. 12. \(D_{\rm track}\) tends to 1 for electrons and tends to 0 for pions. The identification of a candidate track as originating from a signal electron track is based on the value of \(D_{\rm track}\). Those tracks for which \(D_{\rm track}\) is below a given threshold are

rejected. Typically, for an electron identification efficiency of 80%, a pion rejection factor of about 200 can be achieved in \(H\to u\bar{u}\) events.

For each _good quality_ track in the jet the value of the discriminating function for electron identification, \(D_{\rm track}\), defined previously in Eq. 1, has been calculated. For each jet, the track with the highest value \(\max(D_{\rm track})\) is chosen and this single track will now be used to estimate the discriminating function \(D_{\rm jet}\) for the jet. In addition to the variables used for electron identification based on the inner detector and electromagnetic calorimeter information, the track transverse momentum \(p_{T}^{rel}\) relative to the jet axis, shown in Fig. 11 is included. For each jet the discriminating function \(D_{\rm jet}\) is calculated using the selected track as:

\[D_{\rm jet}=\max(D_{\rm track})\times\frac{P_{e}(p_{T}^{rel})}{P_{e}(p_{T}^{rel })+P_{h}(p_{T}^{rel})}, \tag{2}\]

where \(P_{e}(p_{T}^{rel})\) is the probability obtained from the single variable \(p_{T}^{rel}\) that the track originates from a \(b\)-jet and \(P_{h}(p_{T}^{rel})\) is the probability that the track originates from a light jet. Distributions of \(D_{\rm jet}\) obtained for \(b-\) and light jets are shown in Fig. 13. For a given threshold \(D_{\rm jet}^{\rm thr}\), a jet with \(D_{\rm jet}>D_{\rm jet}^{\rm thr}\) is tagged as a \(b\)-jet.

Figure 12: Discriminating function \(D_{\rm track}\) for electrons in the \(H\to b\bar{b}\) sample (hatched histogram) and for pions in the \(H\to u\bar{u}\) sample (solid line). The distributions are normalized to unit area.

### Performance of the \(b\)-tagging algorithm

The \(b\)-tagging efficiency is defined as \(\varepsilon_{b}=N_{b}^{t}/N_{b}\) where \(N_{b}^{t}\) is number of the tagged \(b\)-labelled jets and \(N_{b}\) is the total number of jets labelled as \(b\)-jets. The definition includes the semi-leptonic branching ratios as well as the detector acceptance and the electron reconstruction and identification efficiencies. The jet rejection factor is calculated as \(R_{\rm lightjet}=N_{j}/N_{j}^{t}\), where \(N_{j}\) is the number of light jets and \(N_{j}^{t}\) is the number of light jets tagged by mistake as \(b\)-jets.

Figure 14 shows the rejection of light jets as a function of the \(b\)-tagging efficiency \(\varepsilon_{b}\). The rejection factors achieved against light jets are presented in Table 3.

For a \(b\)-tagging efficiency \(\varepsilon_{b}=7\%\) on inclusive \(b\)-jets, the light jet rejection factor is about 110. This operating point corresponds to a 61% \(b\)-tagging efficiency on semi-electronic \(b\)-jets.

This study has been performed on Monte Carlo simulated data which do not include pile-up effects. Based on previous study [10], a further degradation of the light jets rejection factor by 10% (30%) is expected when on average 4.6 (23) minimum-bias events per beam-crossing are added.

Figure 15 shows the light jet rejection as a function of the jet \(p_{T}\) and \(|\eta|\) for a total \(b\)-tagging efficiency \(\varepsilon_{b}=7\%\). Performance are estimated in five bins in \(|\eta|\) and in seven bins in \(p_{T}\). The rejection of light jets does not depend significantly on jet \(p_{T}\) over the range 30-80 GeV. For lower \(p_{T}\), jets are wider and an electron can escape outside the cone of \(\Delta R=0.4\) and this leads to lower rejections for the same \(b\)-tagging efficiency. For higher jet energies, the jet is narrower and showers coming from the particles in the jet overlap more and thus it is more difficult to separate the electrons, leading to a drop in rejection. A loss in the jet rejection factor can also be observed in the region \(1.37<|\eta|<1.52\) corresponding to the crack between the barrel and the end-caps of the electromagnetic calorimeter. Even though soft electrons are reconstructed only within \(|\eta|<2\), some sensitivity is retained for jet axes just beyond the cut-off as shown in Fig.15.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|} \hline \(\varepsilon_{b}\) (\%) & \(R_{\rm lightjet}\) \\ \hline
8 & \(80\pm 1\) \\
7 & \(110\pm 2\) \\
6 & \(160\pm 3\) \\ \hline \end{tabular}

Figure 14: Rejection factor of light jets \(R_{\rm light\,jet}\) versus \(b\)-tagging efficiency \(\varepsilon_{b}\).

Table 4 shows the fraction of jets tagged of a given type of track for \(\epsilon_{b}=7\%\). Most \(b\)-jets are tagged by true electron tracks; in particular by signal electrons in \(\sim\)65% of cases. Light jets are tagged in \(\sim\)25% of cases by electrons from \(\gamma\)-conversions and Dalitz decays. Light jets are also tagged in \(\sim\)60% of cases by pions.

## 6 Conclusion

Soft electron tagging relies on the semi-leptonic decays of bottom and charm hadrons. It is therefore intrinsically limited by the branching ratios to electrons: about 20% of \(b\)-jets will contain a soft electron, including cascade decays of bottom to charm hadrons. However, when a signal electron is present the algorithm is quite efficient. In addition, tagging algorithms based on soft leptons have low correlations with the track-based \(b\)-tagging algorithms, which is very important for checking and cross-calibrating performance with data.

The study presented here was based on a sample of _WH_ events which have two high \(p_{T}\) and well separated jets. A \(b\)-jet tagging efficiency of about 7% (including the inclusive \(b\to e\nu X\) branching ratio of \(\sim\) 20%) is achieved for a light jet rejection better than 100. The efficiency of the soft electron identification is high, since two-thirds of the \(b\)-jets are tagged by the true electron. Work is ongoing to prepare similar analyses with other Monte Carlo simulated samples with different topologies as well as
