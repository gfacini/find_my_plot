\({}^{\cdot}\)Abstract

The influence of \(\delta\) -electron production on the measurement of muon track in High Pressure Drift Tubes (HPDT) was studied using a GEANT simulation. The probability to spoil the measurement of a muon track by \(\delta\)-electron production is found to be at the level of 3-4 % for the considered configuration of HPDT and single-hit electronics.

Introduction

When detecting muons in LHC detectors there is the well known problem of electromagnetic showers accompanaining of muons passing through the material of the apparatus. One part of this problem is connected with the electromagnetic showers from the material of the detector (for instance the calorimeters) and the other is that of delta-electron production in the actual material of muon system, namely tube's walls and gas itself.

In the first case it is possible to reduce the influence of electromagnetic shower particles by increasing the gap between the calorimeter and the first superlayer of muon system bigger ( calculations show that a distance of 20 cm will reduce the probability of having another charged particles in the same tube as the muon by about an order of magnitude). The magnetic field leakage from the toroid will also reduce the low energy component of electromagnetic showers and prevent them from hit the muon system (or at least the first superlayer).

When dealing with \(\delta\)-electrons produced by a muon in the same tube, it is difficult to avoid spoiling the muon hit in the case when using simple single hit electronics. The other question is that if the gas presssure is increased as in the case of the High Pressure Drift Tubes (HPDT) (with few extra atmospheres) to improve the spatial resolution how does the \(\delta\) -electron production affect the accuracy of the muon measurement.

## 2 \(\delta\) -electron production

The cross-section for a production of a \(\delta\) -electron with an energy T by a muon is \([\![1]\!]:\)

\[d\sigma/dT=2\pi\cdot Z\cdot r_{0}^{2}\cdot m\cdot 1/\beta^{2}\cdot 1/T^{2}[1- \beta^{2}\frac{T}{T_{max}}+\frac{T^{2}}{2E^{2}}]\]

where \(r_{0}\) is the electron radius,

Z is the atomic number of the medium,

m is the electron mass,

\(\beta\) is the incident particle velocity,

\(\gamma=(1-\beta^{2})^{-\nu\nu}\)

E is the energy of the incident particle,

M is its rest mass,

\(T_{max}\) is the kinematic limit for electron energy

\[T_{max}=\frac{2m(\gamma^{2}-1)}{1+2\cdot\gamma(m/M)+(m/M)^{2}}\]

The probability of delta-electron production is a function only of the amount of material the muon is passes through and the threshold on low energy delta -electrons.

The number of \(\delta\)-electrons produced by 1 cm of material can be estimated by:

\[\frac{dN}{dx}\simeq D\cdot\frac{\rho Z}{A}\frac{1}{T_{min}}.\]where \(D=0.307\frac{MeV\,cm^{2}}{2}\)

\(\rho\) - density, \(T_{min}\) - low-energy threshold for \(\delta\) -electrons. The muon momentum only affects the upper limit of the \(\delta\)-electron spectrum. These relatively energetic electrons are a very small part of total amount (Fig.1).

In gases even the relatively low energy electrons have a noticable range and can spoil the measurement of a muon hit if the accuracy of muon measurements is only tens of microns. The practical electron range (i.e. a real distance of electrons from the point of production taking into account multiple scattering etc.) can be approximated by [2] :

\[R_{p}=0.71E^{1.72},\]

where \(R_{p}\) is in \(g\cdot cm^{-2}\) and E is in MeV. The practical range of a \(\delta\) -electron in gas under pressure becomes less than it is at normal conditions (Fig.2). The magnetic field in the tubes can also reduce the 'practical' deviation of a \(\delta\)-electron from the muon track (mostly those with the lowest energy). For example, the initial radius of a 10 keV \(\delta\)-electron in a field of 0.6 T is about 50 \(\mu\)m. Moreover as the trajectory is really a spiral it is clear that the deviation of such \(\delta\)-electron is below the level of diffusion that is the main source of inaccuracy. On the other hand in the magnetic field presence \(\delta\)-electrons of a higher energy, originally directed away from the anode, can be turned back to the anode and hence become closer to the anode than other clusters of ionization on the muon track. Thus the effect of the magnetic field is rather ambiguous for the case of \(\delta\)-electrons.

## 3 Simulation

The detection of high energy muons in one high pressure drift tube taking into account the \(\delta\) -electron production was studied by a GEANT simulation.

The following option was considered:

* One tube of 3 cm diameter with 0.5 mm wall thickness with a gas mixture Ar/ethane 70/30. (The diameter and wall thickness were taken to be equal to those which were used for prototype design). Iron and aluminium tubes were considered.
* The gas pressure varied between 1 and 9 atm.
* Muons of momenta of 100 GeV/c entered the tube in the Y direction with a uniform distribution in Z coordinates. (The direction of tube coincides with the X direction).
* The low energy electrons threshold was taken to be 10 keV
* In the volume of the tube all tracks were traced step by step to get the point on each electron track which is closest to the anode wire. In the case of muon the distance between its track and anode wire was calculated as the shortest distance between these two lines in space.

It was assumed that in the case of simple single-hit electronics, if there are other tracks in the volume of a.tube, only that one which is closest to the anode will be registered. So the probability of a \(\delta\)-electron registration instead of the muon was studied. Below only the \(\delta\) -electrons which were found to be closer to the anode than the muon are considered.

The kinematic parameters of \(\delta\)-electrons were in accordance with the corresponding kinematic laws of two particles scattering. The distributions of momentum and angles of simulated \(\delta\)-electrons are presented Fig.3.

The coordinates of the origin of those \(\delta\) -electrons which were found to be closer to anode than the muon track are presented in Fig.4. One can see the origin points for electrons which have been produced in tube's wall and also in the gas itself. Most of the \(\delta\) -electrons are produced when the muon is going through the tube's volume at large distances from the anode. This is quite natural as most \(\delta\)-electrons have an angle close to 90\({}^{0}\) with the muon track. The distribution of the original coordinate of the \(\delta\) - electrons produced in tube's wall (R coordinate) is presented in Fig.5. The internal diameter of the tube is 1.5 cm and an external one is 0.5 mm bigger. So one can see that most \(\delta\)-electrons which spoil the muon measurement are produced close to the inner surface of the tube but there is a tail which corresponds to electrons with a higher energy in this distribution. It means that on one hand the effect is not directly proportional to the thickness of the tube's wall, but on the other hand there is some probability that \(\delta\)-electron productions in neighbour tubes can affect each other.

The probability of a spoiled measurement in a tube depends on gas pressure (Fig.6) as the amount of material passed by muons is growing up. ('Spoiled' measurement means that the closest distance from a \(\delta\) -electron track to the anode is less by 4\(\sigma\) than the same value for a muon track, where \(\sigma\) is the expected measurement resolution).

There is some saturation in the dependence on gas pressure which appears to be caused by the decrease in the electron range at higher pressure. \(\delta\)-electrons produced in the tube's wall increase the total probability of spoiled measurement by almost constant value which is 3.0 % for iron and 2.2 % for the aluminium tubes ( a wall thickness of 0.5 mm).

The last figure presents the integral probability to a have spoiled muon track measurement. In Fig.7 we show the differential distribution of this probability over the difference between the real distance from a muon track to anode and the distance from \(\delta\)-electron (which was really detected in this case) to the anode. So this value can be considered like 'inaccuracy' in muon measurement caused by \(\delta\) -electrons. One can see that this value may be almost as large as the radius of the tube.

The effect of \(\delta\)-electron production can be considered in terms of the efficiency of precise muon detection as in the case when due to \(\delta\)-electron production the measured drift time is much different from what is for the muon (assuming high resolution). Such tubes will be rejected from the fit. The simulated efficiency over the distance from muon track to the anode for tubes made of aluminium is presented in Fig.8. The same distribution but for the iron tube used in the HPDT beam-test in a comparison with the experimental efficiency of tube [3] is shown in Fig.9. The experimental points were obtained under the condition that the measured coordinate in a tube must be within the limit of \(4\sigma\) with the predicted from other tubes value. (Also the simulated efficiency is multiplied by factor 0.985 which corresponds to general efficiency of tubes)(Later in the fast ATLAS muon system simulation it may be useful to use this differential efficiency of precise muon hit measurement in HPDT).

As mentioned above, the influence of the magnetic field is complex. It is found that the total probability of the spoiled muon tracks for both case without magnetic field and in presence of it (0.6 T) is almost the same. (The difference is within statistical error). However the different parts of \(\delta\) -electron spectrum contribute to the considered effect in both cases. In Fig.10 the difference in spectra of \(\delta\) -electrons which spoil muon measurement in both cases (with and without magnetic field 0.6 T) is shown. One can see that, in the case of presence of magnetic field the contribution of low energy part of total spectrum (up to 1.5 MeV) is less important but the probability of considered effect for \(\delta\) - electrons of higher energy is growing up (in the range 1.5- 5 MeV). At the largest momentum the relevant probabilities becomes almost the same.

## 4 Conclusions

\(\delta\)-electron production can spoil muon measurements in the muon system. The probability of the effect depends on the material crossed by the muon. This probability does not depend noticably on the momentum of the muon, because increasing the muon momenta influences this only the high energy limit of \(\delta\)-electrons which is a very small part of the total number of \(\delta\)-electrons. The magnetic field does not reduce this effect much. The probability that the \(\delta\)-electron track will spoil the muon measurement is about 3-4 % for gas pressures of 2-4 atm. More than half of this is due to \(\delta\)-electron production in tube's wall. So it is desirable to use tubes with smaller wall thickness and less density. The obtained probability that the muon track will be not measured with the proper HPDT resolution in its dependence on the distance from anode could be used in ATLAS muon system responce simulation.
