Abstract

This note comments and illustrates the choice of the material to be used for the construction of the signal electrodes of the Liquid Argon

Electromagnetic Calorimeter, as presented in the technical Design Report (1). A very large number of tests have been carried out on test pieces delivered by

suppliers and on preprototypes.

The RD3 accordion calorimeter uses as signal electrodes a three layer flexible polyimide printed circuit board. The raw material (laminated polyimide copper) come from several supplier : APICAL and FORTIN in 1992, ROGERS (UPILEX, phenolic adhesive) for UV-GEM electrodes in 1994, all suppliers were limited to a standard size roll of 610 mm width.

The analysis of the data collected with the RD3 prototype calorimeter and the observation of the components after several thermal cycle drove the ATLAS collaboration to revisit the RD3 choice. On top of that, the FORTIN firm got out of the market.

**I- Size of the electrodes**

The response to a given shower drop by more than 5% at the border between two signal electrodes ( 2) this behavior could be explained by a wider nominal insulation area at the edge of a given board and by shrinking due to the cold.

We need to reduce this edge effect and to define the size of the board taking account of the availability of the raw material and of the tooling to be handled in the fabrication process.

Polyimide film is available in 1100 mm width, it is possible to find laminate in 1000 mm width. But while Cu could be obtained in laminated sheet ( RA ) or electrodeposit ( ED ) in 610 mm, only ED is available with realistic mechanical tolerances at large dimension. But standard ED appears to be to brittle. At the difference, no special problem has been identified with treated ED-HD copper ( especially no cracks appears while bending with the expected accordion angle).

Three independent firms have produced during 1996, some preprototypes of two square meter area, with available material at this time: KREMPEL large size polyimide laminate with Apical polymer and epoxy adhesive, or large size test pieces under development by BNL and J.Fraivillig (3) based on polyimide glue. All three firms succeeded to produce prototypes, despite some difficulties in curing the laminate. The pattern shape (4) show distortion in the small dimension ( radius in the barrel and \(\varphi\) in the end cap) below 2 tenths of a millimeter and in the large dimension ( \(\eta\) in the barrel and radius in the end cap) of the order of 4 tenths of a millimeter for the two firms etching the full pattern in one single pass. The third firm etching the full area in several passes endure variations above one millimeter. This clearly indicates that the requested precision is available but excludes the mosaic scheme process.

The final accepted solutions are: for the barrel two pieces of maximum area 1850x800 mm\({}^{2}\) and for the end cap, two pieces of maximum area 1500x1000 mm\({}^{2}\).

Consequence: ATLAS accepts to work with treated ED copper ( High Ductility), but the number of laminator firms worldwide is limited. In fact only one has been able to supply in 1996 a roll of large width laminate. As the fabrication process is difficult, it is wise to share the order between two suppliers and to have ATLAS personnel accompanying the production.

**II- Adhesive**

The RD3 material was made of epoxy adhesive for the 1992 prototype and phenol adhesive for the RD3 UV-GEM. Both glues are supposed to hold \(10^{8}\) Gy. But due to water absorption the process in the UV-GEM electrodes appears to be more delicate. The standard adhesive generally used by a laminator is acrylic, but acrylic components tolerate only \(10^{4}\) Gy.

Actually DuPont de Nemours propose all polyimide products (KCL and ECL) (5), but the cost is very expensive and the process for bonding layers must be at a very high temperature (\(400^{\circ}\)C) well above the working range of the industrial autoclave. R&D's, as well as in DuPont and J.Fraivillig companies, are developing a polyimide adhesive which work at a low temperature, but the industrial production process is not yet under control.

Consequence: ATLAS requests the use of epoxy adhesive.

**III- Polyimide**

Dismounting the RD3 calorimeter showed the effect of mechanical stress at the border between bare polyimide and coppered polyimide. Special care must be considered for the mechanical properties of the polyimide. For standard polyimide the properties are very similar at each of the suppliers DuPont, Upilex, Apical. But Dupont commercialize a new polymer with attractive mechanical properties( Kapton E). While the standard polymer is a two component product ( PMDA Pyromellitic Dianhydride + ODA Oxydianiline) the E polymer is a tetra polymer( PMDA+ODA+PPD Paraphenylene Diamine+BPDA Biphenyl Dianaline).

The interest of the E polymer can be seen in the following table (5)

\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|} \hline
**PROPERTY** & **standard polyimide H/V** & **polyimide E** \\ \hline Modulus (Mpa) & 2750 & 5500 \\ \hline Elongation \% & 80 & 40 \\ \hline \end{tabular}

Several studies have been conducted to check the Kapton E properties, especially the Coefficient of Thermal Expansion at cold temperatures, to be compared to stainless steel CTE (6). Remember that the high precision G10 bars used to provide the full precision of the calorimeter are tuned to the CTE of the stainless steel.

The choice of Du Pont KAPTON E reduces the risk connected to thermal shock in the process of fabrication, during the bending phase in accordion shape, and during the lifetime of the liquid Argon calorimeter.

Consequence: The cost of the polyimide which counts for some 10% of the electrode project is increased (cost 96 E/Standard=1.12, and cost 1997, guaranty for two years, E/Standard=1.55). The availability of this special product is reduced, the fabrication of it by DuPont follows a discontinuous schedule and is not directly available " off the shelf ".

**IV- Ink**

The resistive ink must be a polymer resistive product with a curing temperature not exceeding 175\({}^{\circ}\)C. Experience has shown that the final R vary a lot with the shape of the support and with the application process.

Measurements made on the preprototypes show a large variation (factor 5) of the measured value (7).We, also, show that the ratio between R at room temperature and R at liquid argon temperature could be different by a large factor, of the order of 3. RD3 had used a two components ink, which was very difficult to process and very expensive. As the requirement for physics is not too much of a constraint (7b) we choose to use as in the 96 large prototype the ESL D-RS 12116 ink with a range of R ( real in cold) from a few hundred kilo-ohms to a few ten mega-ohms. Other suppliers are available, but their products have not been fully tested.

The difficulties here lies more in the application on a large area and in the handling ( flexibility).

**V-Connector**

The RD3 connector make use of an extra G10 bar glued at the edge of the flexible printed board. This bar induce an extra thickness. Some problems of continuity have been identified in the large prototype.

A mock up assembly has shown the difficulties to keep the RD3 read out board with a scheme where 16 planes with increasing \(\varphi\) angle goes on a single summing board.

The choice for the final design is to use crimp type connector pins reinforced by a solder point and protected with a ryton body. Ryton is a product able to hold radiation ( 10\({}^{8}\) Gy). The connector pin, CRIMPLEX 10025-32, the ryton body and the tool for insertion, produced by NICOMATIC, are recommended for cost efficient arguments.

**VI- Final sandwich thickness**

We need for the final assembly three copper layers, two external for high voltages and one internal for collecting the signal by induction. Basically, we need to assemble a double face coppered Kapton with a single face coppered Kapton. In RD3 and in the large size 96 preprototypes, we use a third component (prepreg) to assemble the whole sandwich. To simplify the fabrication, it appears that it could be possible to request to the laminator a special product where an adhesive layer is deposited on the other face of the single coppered. Hence the number of components to be handled is reduced. This would simplify a lot of the assembly process. The laminator (8) was able to supply large size coppered Kapton E with epoxy-adhesive to produce some test pieces in A4 format. The assembly done at CERN with these has shown a very attractive solution. Peel-off test (9) show a very good adhesion (8 N/mm\({}^{2}\)) (9). The firm KREMPEL have proposed to do it industrially. The adhesive thickness was advertised to be controlled to plus-minus two microns.

In order to be as close as possible to a symmetrical configuration and taking account of other factors like:

a) the fact that the bonding must reduce the adhesive layer by a few microns,

b) the fact that the signal layer (copper etched) has some variations in

depth due to the copper thickness,

we define the final sandwich to be a two component assembly :

\(35\mu\) Cu / \(15\mu\) Ad / \(50\mu\) Kapt / \(15\mu\) Ad /\(35\mu\) Cu

and \(35\mu\) Cu / \(15\mu\) Ad / \(50\mu\) Kapt / \(25\mu\) Ad

Consequence: The basic thickness of the read out electrodes is 275 microns, but the resistive ink dot has introduced locally extra thickness, all together the space needed for the electrodes is around 300 microns.

**VII-Conclusions**The design of the pattern for HV and signal layer, the ground contact, the references for the calorimeter assembly,...will be describe elsewhere (10)

The option of large multi-layer copper polyimide electrodes are largely driven by physics requirements. To fulfill such requirements, the industrial production must imply a lot of R&D, new tooling and new processes. Only after delivery of a sizable number of electrodes, the options presented here could be fully validated.
