###### Abstract

Many physics channels of interest at the LHC involve the measurement of jets and missing transverse momentum. The various physics and detector effects playing a role in the chain that goes from an initial parton produced in the hard scattering process to a reconstructed and calibrated jet in the calorimeters are reviewed. The most relevant issues for a good performance in missing transverse momentum measurement are described. The expected performances of the ATLAS and CMS detectors are presented for some of the characteristics physics channels at the LHC. Jet and triggers are discussed.

## 1 Introduction

Various roles will be played by jets in the LHC Physics. The measurement of jet multiplicity and distribution will be done in the context of QCD, SUSY or other models. Resonances will be identified by their decay to jets like,,,. Central low jet yeto will be applied to eliminate multi-jet background like. Forward jets will be tagged to select boson fusion mechanisms. Large will be an important signature for new physics. The vector will be used in invariant mass reconstruction of decays involving neutrinos like decays.

## 2 ATLAS and CMS calorimetry

The requirements set on the calorimetry to achieve the physics goals at the LHC are listed hereafter. The pseudorapidity coverage should extend to for good resolution and forward jet tagging capability. Thedetector should be hermetic: the necessary gaps for services should not form uninstrumented "cracks" pointing to the interaction region in order to avoid tails from badly reconstructed jets. The calorimeter thickness should reach at least \(\sim 9\) interaction lengths (\(\lambda\)) to avoid longitudinal leakage of high energy pions and reduce punch-through in the muon detector. The granularity is adapted to the lateral hadronic shower size: \(d\eta\times d\phi=0.087\times 0.087\) in the case of CMS and \(d\eta\times d\phi=0.1\times 0.1\) for ATLAS. The calorimeters are composed of the electromagnetic (EM) calorimeter followed by an hadronic (HAD) compartment with optimized longitudinal segmentation (see fig.1).

In case of ATLAS[1], the EM calorimeter consists of 24 radiation lengths (\(X_{0}\)) or 1.2 \(\lambda\) of Pb/LAr calorimeter with three longitudinal sections for (\(\gamma,jet\)) separation. The EM calorimeter is preceded by a preshower to correct for the energy loss in the solenoid coil and cryostat wall situated just in front of the calorimeter. The outer cryostat wall (\(0.4\lambda\)) separates the EM from the Fe/Scintillating Tile hadron calorimeter. In the end-cap region (\(\sim 1.7<\mid\eta\mid<\sim 3\)) Cu/LAr technology is used. While the forward region, covering \(\sim 3<\mid\eta\mid<\sim 5\), consists of a Cu/LAr EM section followed by a W/LAr section. In CMS[2], the PbW04 crystal EM calorimeter (\(\sim 1.1\lambda\)) is combined with a Cu/Scintillating Tile calorimeter, both in the barrel and end-cap region. The latter is segmented in a thin section (\(0.3\lambda\)) followed by the bulk of the calorimeter (\(5.6\ \lambda\)). It is surrounded by the solenoid coil (\(1.4\lambda\)). Two instrumented layers in the muon system provide an additional \(2.5\lambda\) of active calorimeter. The forward region is equipped with a Fe calorimeter instrumented with quartz fibers.

Both CMS and ATLAS calorimeters are non-compensated. The degree of non-compensation of the CMS hadronic section is \(e/h\simeq 1.4\) while for ATLAS

Figure 1: _Schematic representation of the longitudinal segmentation of the ATLAS and CMS barrel sections of the calorimeter._

the degree is \(e/h\simeq 1.35\). The degree of non-compensation of the EM section is substantially higher in both cases. This results in a non-linearity of the pion response of about 15% between 20 and 300 GeV for CMS and about 12% for ATLAS. The resolution and linearity depend on the algorithm used for energy reconstruction. CMS used a simple sum \(E_{tot}=E_{EM}+(\alpha\times H_{1}+H_{2}+H_{3})\). A large signal in \(H_{1}\) indicates that a significant amount of hadronic energy was deposited in the EM, the coefficient \(\alpha\) corrects for the fact that this energy is underestimated because of non-compensation. The resolution is \(\sigma_{E}/E=122\%/\sqrt{(}E)\oplus 5\%\). ATLAS used in the test beam an algorithm that includes a first order correction for non-compensation (quadratic term in \(E_{EM}\)) and an interpolation term between the last EM section (\(E_{EM3}\)) and the first hadronic section (\(E_{H\,AD\,1}\)) to estimate the energy loss in the cryostat: \(E_{tot}=\alpha\times E_{EM}+\beta\times E_{EM}^{2}+\gamma\times E_{HAD}+\delta \times\sqrt{E_{EM3}\times E_{HAD\,1}}\). The resolution is \(\sigma_{E}/E=50\%/\sqrt{E}\oplus 3.4\%\oplus 1.0/E\) applying a \(2\sigma\) noise cut and reconstructing the pion energy in a cone of \(dR=0.3\).

## 3 Jet Reconstruction

There are various factors that play a role in the chain between the initial parton and the reconstructed jet. Among the experimental factors are the different response to neutral and charged component (non-linearity), the lateral shower size, dead material and cracks, longitudinal leakage, and magnetic field. The factors related to physics are fragmentation, initial state radiation, final state radiation, underlying event and minimum bias events.

Figure 2: _Left: jet energy measured with the calorimeters calibrated at the EM scale in cone sizes of dR=1.5 (black circles), dR=0.7 (open triangles), dR=0.4 (black triangles); Right: jet energy resolution at \(\eta=0.3\) for various cone sizes after applying a jet energy calibration algorithm (ATLAS)._

The ratio of reconstructed jet energy to the particle level energy inside the cone, when the calorimeters are calibrated at the EM scale, is typically of the order of 0.8 (see fig.2 left). It increases with jet energy, as the pions from the fragmentation get more energetic, and decreases for smaller cone size due to lateral shower containment effects. The jet energy reconstruction algorithm has to correct for these effects. The calorimeter contribution to the jet energy resolution, measured in ATLAS using the particle level energy as a reference, is shown in fig.2 at \(\eta=0.3\). The jet calibration algorithm included energy dependent weights for the different calorimeter compartments and correction terms for energy loss in dead materials. The resolution is \(\sigma_{E}/E=48\%/\sqrt{E}\oplus 1.7\%\) for a very large cone (dR=1.5). The sampling term increases to \(52\%\,(62\%)\) for a cone size of dR=0.7 (dR=0.4) due to the fluctuations of out of cone losses for low energy jets. For high energy jets the particles are very collimated and do not suffer from these losses. But for larger \(\eta\), the pseudorapidity lines become progressively denser, hence out-of-cone losses start to affect also high energy jets, resulting in an increase of the constant term for small cone sizes.

The electronic noise is another detector related effect that influences the resolution. In ATLAS, the level of noise is 200 MeV in a tower \(d\eta\times d\phi=0.1\times 0.1\) and 0.7 GeV (1.4 GeV) in a cone of dR=0.4 (0.7). In CMS, the level is 150 MeV in a tower of \(d\eta\times d\phi=0.087\times 0.087\). Once the jet energy calibration is applied,

Figure 3: _Left: jet energy resolution (calorimeter contribution) without pile-up (open squares) and with high-uminosity pile-up events (stars) for a cone size of dR=0.4. Right: the intrinsic physics contribution to the resolution (open circles) and the calorimeter related resolution (open crosses); combined in quadrature (black dots) they represent the resolution with which the parton energy is measured._

the electronic noise contributes a \(1.7\,GeV/E\) term to the jet energy resolution for a dR=0.4 cone. At high luminosity, minimum bias events generate 0.5 GeV of transverse energy in a tower \(d\eta\times d\phi=0.1\times 0.1\) and 3.5 GeV (14 GeV) in a cone of radial aperture dR=0.4 (0.7) (el. noise included). Minimum bias deteriorates notably the resolution of low \(E_{T}\) jets (see fig 3 left). The resolution becomes \(\sigma_{E}\,/E\,=\,6\,2\%/\sqrt{E}\oplus 1.5\%\oplus 4.7/E\). Large cones like dR=0.7 cannot be used at high luminosity.

In the chain that goes from the parton to a reconstructed jet in a "cone", physics related effects also contribute to the resolution: fluctuation in the fragmentations, FSR, underlying events, magnetic field sweeping particles out of the cone (\(p_{T}\) cutoff of 0.5 GeV ATLAS and 0.9 GeV in CMS). This "intrinsic" contribution is shown in fig.3 together with the calorimeter contribution for a fixed cone algorithm (dR=0.4) applied to \(Z^{0}+jet\) events.

## 4 Jet Algorithms

There are two basic approaches but many possible variations. In "cone-like" algorithms a cone is drawn around a seed. There are variant on how the cone direction is iterated, how jet overlap is handled, etc. "Clustering" algorithms (QCD inspired) pair "particles" (approximated by calorimeter towers) starting from the "closest" particles. They stop at a fixed jet multiplicity or a maximum "size", etc. The various algorithms suffer from different energy bias as a function of \(E_{T}\) originating from physics effect like pile-up (luminosity dependent) or experimental effects like detector non-linearity and shower size effects. These effects depend on jet particle composition and reconstructed size. The choice of jet algorithm will depend on the physics channel and luminosity conditions. For example, different algorithms will be used for QCD jet multiplicity study at low luminosity or for high \(p_{T}\)\(W\to jj\) reconstruction at high luminosity. The jet energy calibration will be a complex issue because of the combination of physics and detector effects that depend on the jet algorithm and the luminosity. In-situ physics processes like \(Z^{0}+jet\) and \(W\to jj\) will be used, combined with test beam information.

## 5 Reconstruction of resonances

Reconstruction of resonances decaying to jets will be used in many physics analysis. \(W\to jj\) decays are of interest in a wide range of \(p_{T}\) of the \(W\). An example of \(jj\) invariant mass reconstructed with ATLAS at low luminosity is given in the fig.4 (left) for \(W\) with \(p_{T}\) in the range 120-150 GeV. The resolution is \(\thicksim 8~{}GeV\); it increases to \(\thicksim 13~{}GeV\) at high luminosity. The tail at low mass is due to a bias in the jet direction when the jets overlap, a feature that gets more pronounced with the boost due of a high \(p_{T}\) decaying object. An example of a \(110~{}\,\mathrm{GeV}\) Higgs decaying to \(b\overline{b}\) as reconstructed at high luminosity with the CMS detector is shown in fig.4 (right). The resolution is \(\thicksim 14~{}GeV\) at high luminosity.

## 6 Jet trigger

The jet cross-section is very steeply falling with \(p_{T}\): \(d\sigma/dp_{T}\thicksim 1/p_{T}^{3}\). The sharpness of the efficiency curve is important to avoid that the trigger rate is dominated by lower \(p_{T}\) jets. At the Level-1 trigger, both ATLAS and CMS use a sliding window algorithm searching for a local maximum in the (\(d\eta\times d\phi\)) projected transverse energy map. The optimum window size depends on the jet \(E_{T}\) threshold and the luminosity conditions (programmable in the case of ATLAS). CMS applies a two-parameter \(\eta\) dependent energy correction algorithm that improves the resolution and consequently the sharpness of the efficiency curve as shown in fig.5 (left). At Level-2 or Level-3, standard offline jet algorithms can be applied with a better jet energy calibration. A reduction of rate of about a factor two is seen in ATLAS with respect to the Level-1 rate. If the allocated bandwidth for jet triggers is set for example to \(25~{}\mathrm{Hz}\), then the corresponding \(E_{T}\) thresholds to be applied are \(360~{}\mathrm{GeV}\), \(150~{}\mathrm{GeV}\), \(100~{}\mathrm{GeV}\) for single-, three-, four-jet triggers respectively at low luminosity.

## 8 \(E_{T}^{miss}\) reconstruction

The \(p_{T}^{miss}\) vector is used for invariant mass reconstruction like the \(A/H\to\tau\tau\) decay, henceforth a good resolution is important. Large \(E_{T}^{miss}\) will be an important signature for new physics like for example in SUSY models. Tails from fake \(E_{T}^{miss}\) due to instrumental effects like "cracks", generating tails in the reconstructed jet energy, have to be minimized. The \(p_{T}^{miss}\) vector is reconstructed from cell (or tower) energies. The important factors for the resolution as studied by ATLAS with \(A/H\to\tau\tau\) decays are the following. A calorimeter coverage up to \(\mid\eta\mid\sim 5\) is needed. The resolution \(\sigma(p_{X,Y}^{miss})\), measured at particle level, increases from 2.3 GeV to 8.3 GeV if the coverage decreases from \(\mid\eta\mid\sim 5\) to \(\mid\eta\mid\sim 3\). The particle level resolution \(\sigma(p_{X,Y}^{miss})\) increases to 7 GeV when the detector response is fully simulated. The contribution to the calorimeter resolution depends on \(\mid\eta\mid\). The contribution from the different regions are: barrel (5 GeV), end cap (4 GeV), forward (3 GeV) decreasing because the average transverse energy in the various regions decreases. The electronic noise (a 1.5 \(\sigma\) cut is applied) increases the resolution from 8.3 GeV to 9 GeV. The \(p_{X,Y}^{miss}\) resolution can be parameterized as \(\sigma(p_{X,Y}^{miss})=0.46\times\sqrt{\Sigma E_{T}}\) (see fig.7). At high luminosity, the pile-up events contribute an additional 15 GeV to the resolution. At the Level-1 trigger the \(E_{T}^{miss}\) is calculated from tower \(E_{T}\) with a granularity of \(d\eta\times d\phi=0.348\times 0.348\) in CMS and \(0.2\times 0.2\) in ATLAS. In both cases the least significant bit is 1 GeV. At Level-3, \(E_{T}^{miss}\) can be recalculated with finer granularity and better calibration constants. The Level-1 rate is dominated by QCD Dijet events and pile-up. An ATLAS estimate of the trigger rate at low luminosity is shown in fig.7. Below 60 GeV, minimum bias events increase the

Right: inclusive \(E_{T}^{miss}\) trigger rates from QCD jet events as a function of the \(E_{T}^{miss}\) threshold applied at Level-1._rate by a factor \(\sim 5\); above 100 GeV the pile-up has no effect anymore. At high luminosity, the rates increase by a factor \(\sim 10^{3}\) for a 100 GeV threshold and \(\sim\!10\) for a 200 GeV threshold.

## 9 Forward jet tagging and low \(p_{T}\) jet veto

Forward jet tagging will be used to select boson fusion processes (see fig.8 left). A tagging efficiency of \(\sim 90\%\) can be achieved starting to decrease at \(\mid\!\!\mid\!\eta\mid\!\!\geq 4\) because of the decreasing average \(p_{T}\) of the quark. At high luminosity, an efficiency of \(\sim 80\,\%\) can be achieved for a fake tag rate of \(\sim 10\%\). Central jet veto is used to reject high jet multiplicity background, usually \(t\overline{t}\). Fig.8 shows that in ATLAS an efficiency of \(\sim 60\%\) is achieved for a heavy \(H\to WW\to l\nu jj\) signal and \(\sim 10\,\%\) for the \(t\overline{t}\) background.

## 10 Conclusion

There is a lot of interesting physics involving jets and \(E_{T}^{miss}\) at the LHC. The ATLAS and CMS detectors have shown that their calorimeters are prepared to trigger and reconstruct these quantities in the challenging environment of a high luminosity hadron collider.
