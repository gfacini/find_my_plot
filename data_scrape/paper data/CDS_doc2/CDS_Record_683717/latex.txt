Introduction

The full-scale prototype of a BOS MDT chamber has been constructed at MPI Munich in a common effort of several ATLAS muon institutes following the specifications in the ATLAS Muon Technical Design Report (TDR) [1]. The goal was to demonstrate that with the barrel chamber assembly method for series production as described in the TDR, the specified accuracy of 20 \(\mu\)m rms in the relative wire positions at the tube ends can be achieved as well as the required tolerance of 100 \(\mu\)m on the centering of the wires within the tubes over their whole length. For the 2160 mm wide BOS chambers, this requires the use of a force compensation system to eliminate gravitational sag of the cross plates. This system, as described in the TDR [1], was first used and demonstrated during the construction of the BOS prototype chamber.

The BOS chambers are among the largest in the barrel with a tube length of 3800 mm and a width of 2160 mm containing 72 tubes per layer and 432 in total in 2\(\times\) 3 tube layers. The layout of the prototype chamber is shown in Fig. 1. At the end for the high-voltage connection to the tubes (HV side), the long beams are connected by a plate to which one of the three bearings for the 3-point support of the chamber is connected. The other two supports are connected to the two long beams at the opposite ends.

All tubes have been produced at MPI Munich with manpower support from JINR Dubna and NIKHEF. They were fully tested at LMU Munich according to the quality control specifications described in the TDR [1]. The spacer frame including the RASNIK in-plane alignment system, as described in the TDR [1], was designed and constructed by NIKHEF. The gas distribution system and the Faraday cages were designed by the University of Freiburg. The HV boards were designed and fabricated by Boston University, the readout boards at BNL.

The assembly jigging for the BOS chamber, as described in detail in the TDR [1], was set up on a granite table in a temperature-controlled clean room at MPI where the glueing of the tube layers took place between 26 January and 16 February 1998 including extensive measurements and verification of the mechanical accuracy. The completed chamber has been measured with the X-ray tomograph at CERN and has been tested in the H8 muon beam at CERN.

## 2 Tube Production and Test

The 3800 mm long tubes were produced by ALU-MENZIKEN and cleaned in a facility at CERN according to the TDR specifications [1]. In a sample of 100 tubes, the outer diameter at the ends was measured to be \((29.975\pm 0.005)\) mm with a cutoff of the gaussian distribution at 29.970 mm [2].

The tubes have been wired with the MPI glueing method which locates the wires in the tubes in always the same position with respect to the combs holding the tubes which are identical for tube wiring and chamber assembly. Each tube is placed in the combs for wiring and chamber assembly in the same azimuthal orientation around the tube axis in order to minimize sensitivity to tube non-roundness. The wire was positioned relative to the combs holding the tubes simultaneously at both tube ends and fixed in the position with glue curing fast under the illumination with UV-light. The wiring method and setup are described in detail in [3], [4].

The endplug compatible with the wiring method and used for the BOS chamber prototype is shown in Figs. 2 and 3 and described in the TDR[1] and in detail in [3]. The total tube length, including endplug, was adjusted to \(\pm 0.5\) mm during the insertion of the endplug into the tubes. Uniformity of the tube length is not critical for the parallel gas connection used for the BOS prototype.

The tubes were wired at MPI in a dust-free, temperature-controlled room. The results of the quality control tests at LMU Munich are described in [3]. The wire tension and sag was measured to be equal for all tubes within \(1\%\) rms. The wire position at the tube ends was measured for each individual tube with the X-ray method [1]. Results for the wire coordinates \(y\) and \(z\) are shown in Figs. 4 and 5 separately for the tubes in each of the two multilayers of the BOS chamber and for the two tube ends (sides A and B). Side A corresponds to the HV side of the chamber for multilayer 1 (glued first) and to the readout (RO) side for multilayer 2. The tubes for the first multilayer were produced first.

The standard deviations of gaussian fits to the wire coordinate distributions from the X-ray measurements of individual tubes are \(8-12\:\mu\)m. The tubes were held in the V-blocks for X-ray measurement in the same way as they are placed in the combs used for chamber assembly. Since at the begining of the measurements the absolute calibration of the X-ray device was still uncertain, in Figs. 4 and 5 the wire positions with respect to the tube centers were determined as the average of the wire positions measured in two orientations of the tube around the tube axis relative to the jig, in the same orientation as during tube wiring and after rotation by \(180^{\circ}\) (see [3]). Therefore in the wire position distributions in Figs. 4 and 5, variations in the tube outer diameter are still folded in.

For the tubes used for the second multilayer, the short-distance straightness near the ends was significantly worse and outside the specifications (see [1]) compared to the tubes for the first multilayer. This affects the reproducibility of the placement of the tubes in the jigs and therefore the wire position for the X-ray measurements and chamber assembly.

In the second multilayer, the average wire position in the \(y\)-coordinate on side A of the tubes is shifted by \(37.5\:\mu\)m outwards from the middle plane of the chamber with respect to the nominal position. With respect to the tubes of the d first multilayer, the shift in the average wire position is \(25.5\:\mu\)m. This shift became apparent from the evaluation of the X-ray measurements of the tubes when a major fraction had already been fabricated. It was not corrected for the wiring of the remaining tubes, so it would be common for all tubes in the second multilayer. This was later reproduced in the X-ray tomograph measurements at CERN (see below).

The shift was caused by a vertical tilt of the wiring jigs on side A relative to the jigs on side B which could be traced back to contruction work in the building going on at the time when the displacement occurred. In the provisional wiring setup for the tubes of the prototype chamber, the jigs for both tube ends were installed on separate tables; a movement of the floor under one table could cause a tilt as it was observed. In the final wiring setup, the jigs for both tube ends will be mounted on a common table and their relative orientation as well as the wire position with respect to the tube jigs will be continuously monitored, so that such displacements will be prevented.

Assembly Setup

The chamber assembly jig used for the construction of the BOS prototype has been described in detail in the TDR [1]. The setup installed on a granite table of size \(4200\,\mathrm{mm}\times\,2500\,\mathrm{mm}\) is shown in Fig. 6. The assembly table is set up in a temperature-controlled clean room of class \(100000\). The working temperature of \(20^{\circ}\) was stabilized to \(\pm 0.5^{\circ}\) within the volume of \(2\,\mathrm{m}\) height above the surface of the table. A temperature difference of \(0.1^{\circ}\) has been measured between the top and the bottom of the chamber on the assembly table. Humidity was controlled to be \((45\pm 5)\) %. Clean room clothes and gloves were used during the installation of the jigging and the whole assembly procedure.

The tube jig is assembled out of comb modules with \(20\,\mathrm{tube}\) positions each. \(9\,\mathrm{comb}\) lines are installed on the granite table at a distance of \(500\,\mathrm{mm}\) (\(300\,\mathrm{mm}\) for the two comb lines at the tube ends). Each comb line consists of \(4\,\mathrm{comb}\) modules. The layout is shown in Fig. 7. Each tube layer of the BOS chamber consists of \(72\,\mathrm{tubes}\). The comb lines were aligned in the \(z\) coordinate with respect to the precise edge of the granite table (the reference side; see below) and in \(x\) with a \(2\,\mathrm{m}\) long granite ruler. The comb lines can expand or shrink with temperature variations along the \(z\) direction from their fixation point at the reference edge of the granite table.

The precision comb modules (see Fig. 8) were produced completely industrially. They are cut out of hardened FORTAL \(7075\) aluminum plates using electric spark erosion. The comb modules were produced in triplets in the wire erosion process. The V-groove design of the comb modules is shown in Fig. 9. It minimizes sensitivity of the tube vertical (\(y\)) positions to tube outer diameter variations. Fig. 8 illustrates the installation of the comb modules on the granite table. More details are given in the Appendix.

All comb modules have been measured on a \(3\mathrm{D}\) measuring machine by placing precise steal cylinders of \(30.000\,\mathrm{mm}\) diameter in the V-grooves. Results for the \(z\)-pitch and the vertical (\(y\)) position of the cylinders are shown in the TDR [1]. The average horizontal (\(z\)) pitch of the \(36\,\mathrm{comb}\) modules was measured to be \((30.0366\pm 0.0008)\,\mathrm{mm}\). The measured horizontal (\(z\)) spacing and the height (\(y\)) of the V-grooves of individual comb modules showed rms errors of \(1-9\,\mathrm{\mu m}\) (majority \(2-5\,\mathrm{\mu m}\)) and \(1-8\,\mathrm{\mu m}\) (majority \(2-5\,\mathrm{\mu m}\)), respectively.

The \(8\,\mathrm{best}\) comb modules with respect to uniform height (\(y\) coordinate) were selected for the comb lines at the tube ends. Distributions of the \(z\)-distances and of the residuals from the nominal value of the \(y\)-position of test cylinders inserted in the V-grooves are shown in Figs. 10-13 for the tube positions \(1\)-\(72\) of the two end comb lines. The rms values of the height distributions are \(3-4\,\mathrm{\mu m}\). The \(z\)-pitch of the end comb lines is \(30.0368\,\mathrm{mm}\) with a dispersion of the \(z\)-distances of the V-grooves of \(5\,\mathrm{\mu m}\). Some of the end comb modules show significantly larger scattering of the \(z\)-distances than the others (see Figs. 10 and 11). Here is room for improvement by better selection of end comb modules which was not done for the prototype chamber because of lack of time.

## 4 BOS Chamber Assembly

### Insertion of Tubes

During the assembly, the tubes are held down in the V-grooves using vacuum suction pads with \(15\,\mathrm{mm}\) diameter in the end combs (suction force of about \(400\,\mathrm{g}\)) and with \(8\,\mathrm{mm}\) diameter in the intermediate combs. The tubes are held in the end combs \(25\,\mathrm{mm}\) from the tube ends. Measurements of the relative \(y\)-position of wired tubes (height of the top of the tube above the granite table measured with a feeler gauge) in the end combs on the HV and the readout side (tube sides A and B, respectively, during glueing of the first multilayer) are shown in Fig. 14. The widths of the residual distributions are \(7-8\)\(\mu\)m which include the effect of tube outer diameter variations and uncertainties in the correct placement of the tubes in the V-grooves.

The horizontal glue gap between the tubes inserted in the combs was verified by visual inspection along the whole tube length with illumination of the tube layer from below. This method was found to be the most efficient one for the detection of touching tubes due to tube non-straightness or problems with the suction of the tubes into the combs. Situations where several adjacent tube get displaced are critical with respect to the wire concentricity requirement. They could all be detected and resolved in this way by relocating tubes; no tubes had to be rejected because of non-straightness in between the combs.

### Vertical Stacking of Tube Layers

For the vertical stacking of the tube layers, the spheres mounted at both sides of the cross plates are supported on 6 sphere blocks (towers; see [1]) which are increased in height for successive tube layers within a multilayer using precisely machined distance plates. Compressibility in the tower height of approximately \(10\)\(\mu\)m under the load of the chamber was found during the first tests of the assembly setup and confirmed by dedicated measurements. The origin was identified to be the ball bearings on which the spheres are supported moveable in the \(x-z\)-plane and which make imprints in the base plates. The compressibility may be reduced to a certain degree by more thorough hardening of the base plates.

Exceptions with respect to the degrees-of-freedom of the sphere supports are two towers at the chamber ends on one side of the assembly table (defined therefore as the reference side): one is fixed in both coordinates and the second one constrained to movements in \(x\)-direction to ensure relative alignment of the tube layers with respect to rotations around the \(y\) axis. The middle tower on the reference side must allow for free movements of the sphere in \(x\) and \(z\). Otherwise the support of the chamber on the spheres is over-constrained, especially after stiffening by one or more tube layers glued, which leads to incorrect and irreproducible \(y\) positions of the spheres on the towers.

Because of concerns about the height stability of the sphere blocks under load after initial

The measurement accuracy in all cases is \(5-10\)\(\mu\)m.

tests, the uncertainties in the cross plates sag compensation and the associated cross plate movements in \(y\) and because of observed enlarged tube outer diameters near the tube crimp location, it was decided to increase the vertical wire spacing by 30 \(\mu\)m from the nominal value of \(\Delta y_{\mathrm{nominal}}=26.011\) mm (corresponding to a layer-to-layer wire pitch of 30.035 mm) in order to avoid touching of tube layers at any instance during assembly. The extra vertical spacing was created by adding steal foils to the tower height and verified by measuring with gauge blocks the distance from the combs to the outer walls of the tube layer(s) already glued to the spacer (see Table 1). The resulting increased vertical wire pitch of on average 26.054 mm from increased tower heights was reproduced in the X-ray tomograph measurements with an average \(y\)-pitch of 26.059 mm (see Table 1).

### Force Compensation for the Cross Plates

The sag of the cross plates under the weight of the spacer and of the glued tubes layers was eliminated by a force compensation system with 4 removable bars inserted through the long beams at the inside of the two outer cross plates and on both sides of the middle cross plate (see the TDR [1] and Fig. 6). The force compensation bars are supported at both ends on the granite table with with screws to adjust the height and therefore the force. For series production, automatic pneumatic adjustment and measurement of the forces applied to the force compensation bars is desireable. For the prototype construction, independent manual adjustment of all force compensation bars was useful to study the principle and its limitations (see Table 2).

The sag of the cross plates was measured with RASNIK systems installed on the side of each cross plate over its full length. The RASNIK in-plane alignment system and the RASNIK systems on the cross plates were calibrated by placing the spacer on the jigging (sphere towers) and reading the RASNIK measurements in an initial (INI) position and in the inverted (INV) position after rotation around the \(x\) axis by 180\({}^{\circ}\) (see Figs. 15 and 16). The cross plate sag is the average of the on-cross-plate RASNIK readings in initial and inverted position if the forces of the long beams on the cross plates are symmetric for both orientations, i.e. if there are no stresses built into the chamber. The calibration measurements were repeated after glueing of each tube layer and monitored carefully. The zero-positions of the in-plane RASNIK lenses were stable within \(\pm 5\)\(\mu\)m in \(z\) and \(\pm 10\)\(\mu\)m in \(y\) over the whole assembly procedure. The \(y\) calibration readings are affected by incomplete compensation of the middle cross plate sag (see below). The optical monitoring systems were read out and watched continuously during the whole assembly operation.

The gravitational sag of the middle cross plate could be measured with the on-cross-plate RASNIK system only during glueing of the first multilayer. For the assembly of the second multilayer the on-cross-plate RASNIK monitor on the middle cross plate had to be removed for space reasons since the design of the BOS chamber spacer had not forseen the installation of on-cross-plate sag monitors. However, from the combined data of the in-plane alignment system and the RASNIK systems on the outer cross plates, the sag of the middle cross plate can be reconstructed with high accuracy. This was verified during all operations of the assembly of the first multilayer by comparing the direct and the indirect measurements of the middle cross plate sag (see Fig. 17). In the future, an on-cross-plate RASNIK system on the middle cross plate can therefore be avoided.

The long beams were adjusted to the center of the middle cross plate with an accuracy of \(\pm 50\)\(\mu\)m by comparing the spacer sag measurements of the longitudinal RASNIK in-planealignment systems on both sides of the chamber while the spacer was held in vertical position on the crane at the support points on the plates connecting the long beam ends. After this adjustment, the readings of the on-cross-plate RASNIK systems in the two vertical positions of the spacer on the crane (V1, V2) are in the middle between the readings in the initial and inverted position of the spacer on the table as expected for vanishing cross plate sag (see Figs. 15 and 16). The cross plates sags in the initial (IN) and inverted (INV) position are now symmetric (same absolute values with opposite signs) with respect to the vertical calibration measurements and can now be used as references for the force compensation adjustment.

In the two horizontal (H1, H2) positions of the spacer on the crane, the cross plates are slightly curved upwards (see Figs. 15 and 16) due to the additional weight of the spheres which holds them on the sphere support towers even with full force compensation.

After the long beam adjustment and the RASNIK calibration, the RASNIK measurements on the cross plates can be used to adjust the force compensation: The screws of the force compensation bars were turned sequentially in steps until the measured curvature of all three cross plates was minimized. The RASNIK sag measurements before and after force compensation with increasing number of tube layers glued are given in Table 2 and Fig. 18. The rather large cross plate sag of the 2160 mm wide BOS chamber makes force

Table 2: Sag of the high-voltage (HV), readout (RO) and middle (MI) cross plates supported on the sphere towers before and after force compensation with increasing number of tube layers glued (with \(y\)-axis pointing upwards). The number of turns of the force adjustment screws needed to reach compensation are given in the last column. (Note that after glueing of layer 4 a readjustment of the fixations of the force compensation bars to the long beams was done and that therefore the number of turns needed cannot be compared with previous ones.)compensation necessary to achieve the required precision in the wire positions and to avoid touching of tube layers during the stacking process. For the latter, the force compensation must act instantaneously when the spacer frame is lowered on the sphere blocks. Therefore the force compensation was adjusted in advance as described above before the next layer of tubes was inserted in the combs and the spacer frame was lowered again. The heavy bearings for holding the chamber on the crane caused additional cross plate sag of 5 \(\mu\)m and were removed during force compensation and glueing and for the measurements in Table 2 and Fig. 18.

After force compensation, the residual sag of the outer cross plates was below 5 \(\mu\)m for the first multilayer glued (the goal) and at most 10 \(\mu\)m for the second multilayer which is sufficient for the required chamber accuracy. For the middle cross plate which carries a larger load than the outer cross plates, the remaining sag was \(\leq\) 7 \(\mu\)m for the first multilayer and \(\leq\) 17 \(\mu\)m for the second multilayer. Between the tube ends the tube positioning requirements can be relaxed; the wire position is not affected by the tube position and the tolerance on the concentricity of wire and tube is only 100 \(\mu\)m. No additional weights were used to hold the spheres in position in their supports during force compensation. Additional weights will help to achieve complete compensation up to the maximum number of layers before the spheres are lifted from their supports.

Stacking of the tube layers and the lifting of the spacer during force compensation was monitored with two lasers passing through transparent MPA-ALMY position sensors mounted on the spacers at the sphere holders between spheres and cross plate and on both chamber ends on the granite table as reference (see [1], [5] and Fig. 6). A lifting of the cross plates at the location of the mounted sensors by \(20-30\,\mu\)m was measured with this system (see Fig. 19). It is consistent with the straightening of the cross plates, including the sphere holders mounted on them, between the sphere supports during the force compensation.

The gravitational sag of the chamber along the \(x\)-direction with increasing number of glued tube layers was measured with the in-plane alignment system while the chamber was supported almost kinematically on the crane in the two horizontal positions (see Table 3

The sags measured with the longitudinal RASNIK monitors along the two sides of the chamber as well as the average sag are shown. The last row corresponds to the completed chamber without the weight of the spheres attached to the cross plates during assembly.

and Fig. 20). The sag values correspond to the weight of the chamber including the spheres mounted on the cross plate and the steal plates connecting the long beams. For the last row in Table 3, the spheres were removed after completion of the chamber. The sag values were measured with the two RASNK monitors oriented parallel to the two long beams.

The sag values measured in the initial and the inverted horizontal position agree quite well. The sag values on both sides are different due to internal stresses in the spacer left over after the long beam adjustment on the middle cross plate with an accuracy of \(\pm 50\)\(\mu\)m sufficient to make the cross plate sag symmetric in the initial and inversed horizontal position (see above). The difference becomes smaller with increasing number of tube layers adding stiffness to the chamber. The chamber sag adjustment needed in order to match the wire sag is therefore different on the two long beams The measured sags to be compensated deviate from the calculated average sag of a chamber without internal stresses.

### Glueing of the Tube Layers

The tube layers were glued sequentially first for one multilayer and then after turning of the spacer for the second multilayer. The tube layers are numbered in the sequence of glueing. The location of each drift tube in the chamber was recorded. The tubes are identified by numbers engraved before the wiring procedure.

A semi-automatic glue dispenser with two glueing heads moving parallel to the tubes (see Figs. 21, 22 and 28) was used to deposit well defined glue ropes in between and on the tubes inserted in the combs. Araldite 2011 (two-component epoxy) from Ciba-Geigy was used for glueing the tubes to each other. The glue deposition can be shut off automatically and instantaneously at any position along the tubes. 45 minutes were needed for a full layer of 72 tubes of 3.8 m length which is just enough for a setting time of the glue of about one hour. The glue distribution time can be shortened by using premixed glue and/or an additional glue dispenser head.

The diameters of the three glue outlets of each dispenser and the distribution speed were optimised such that the diameter of the glue ropes is not larger than 0.5 mm. The amount of glue on the tubes was minimised to reduce out-of-plane deflections of the tubes between the cross plates when two tube layers are glued together (see the illustration in Fig. 23). The tube deflections have to be controlled in order to keep the 100 \(\mu\)m tolerance on the centering of the wires in the tubes. The effect is expected to be most pronounced for the glueing of the second to the first tube layer in each multilayer since the force of the first-layer to compress the glue is only \(1-2\) g/cm per tube.

Out-of-plane deflections of the tubes have been measured in a glueing test where a second tube layer was put on the first one in the combs with a 50 \(\mu\)m spacer foil in between and with weights on top of the tubes layers at the \(x\)-positions of the cross plates. Fig. 24 shows the deviations in the tube height from the nominal value for the first layer in the combs and for the second layer glued on top. The measurements were done with a feeler gauge on top of several tubes at the ends of the comb lines where they are accessible. A maximum deviation of 130 \(\mu\)m was observed at the position of the third comb, 80 cm from the tube ends. During chamber assembly, the top tube layer will apply more force on the glue than in this test because these tubes are glued with fixed angle to the cross plates.

To eliminate possible out-of-plane deflections during the assembly of the chamber, weights were put on top of the tube layers already glued to the spacer above the positions of the third and seventh comb, 80 cm from the tube ends, while a 50 \(\mu\)m thick and 1 cm wide

Table 1).

The measured average \(y\)-distance between the two wire planes closest to the spacer in both multilayers (layers 1 and 4) from all X-ray scans is \(\Delta y_{\rm meas}^{\rm spacer}=347.040\) mm on the HV side and 347.078 mm on the RO side with an uncertainty of about \(\pm 10\)\(\mu\)m. The measured values agree exactly with the expectations from the chamber assembly tooling. The measured sphere block height of 276.550 mm and the height of 118.030 mm of a 30.000 mm diameter cylinder on the combs above the surface of the granite table (see Fig. A2) determine the nominal spacer height to be 317.040 mm. The tube wiring method [3], [4] placed the wires with respect to the combs in a position corresponding to the center of a 30.000 mm diameter cylinder inserted in the combs. The expected distance between wire planes of layer 1 and 4 is therefore \(\Delta y_{\rm expect}^{\rm spacer}=347.040\) mm. On the RO side, the relative shift in the average \(y\) positions of the wires in the tubes for the first multilayer (side B) and for the second multilayer (side A) increases the expected multilayer distance to 347.072 mm (see Figs. 4 and 5) which is quantitatively reproduced in the

The residuals of the X-ray tomograph measurements of the \(z\) and \(y\) positions of the wires in both multilayers with respect to the ideal wire grid for the whole chamber (with the expectations for \(z\)- and \(y\)-pitch and the multilayer distances on HV and RO side) are shown in Figs. 31-33 for scans along the three cross plates. No parameters have been left free to adjust. The data were corrected for the sag of the outer cross plates as measured with the on-cross plate RASNIK systems during the X-ray scans and also seen in the X-ray scan data. The standard deviations of the residual distributions are below the required 20 \(\mu\)m in \(y\) and \(z\) at both chamber ends (HV and RO side): \(\sigma_{y}(HV)=17.4\)\(\mu\)m, \(\sigma_{z}(HV)=17.7\)\(\mu\)m and \(\sigma_{y}(RO)=16.3\)\(\mu\)m, \(\sigma_{z}(RO)=14.6\)\(\mu\)m. In the middle of the chamber, the wire positions scatter even less, by about a factor of \(1/\sqrt{2}\), as expected from the average of the wire positions at the chamber ends: \(\sigma_{y}(MI)=12.5\)\(\mu\)m and \(\sigma_{z}(MI)=13.9\)\(\mu\)m.

## 6 Conclusions

With the construction of the BOS prototype chamber it has been demonstrated that with the assembly method described in the Technical Design Report for the barrel chambers the required wire positioning accuracy can safely be achieved. It has been shown that the cross plate sag compensation scheme works and that out-of-plane deflections of the tubes between the cross plates can be controlled in a straight-forward way.
