###### Abstract

In this document we present the data obtained in the irradiation in a \({}^{60}Co\) source of WLS fibres for the Tilecal calorimeter. The optical, mechanical and radiation hardness properties of these fibres were developed in close contact with three producers: Bicron, Kuraray and Pol.Hi.Tech. The results on the degradation of the light output and attenuation length from five irradiations are presented. The fibres were irradiated with a total dose at least 3 times higher than the dose predicted for 10 years of operation of LHC at nominal luminosity.

## 1 Introduction

Tilecal is the sampling hadronic calorimeter for the barrel and extended barrel region of the ATLAS detector [1]. It uses iron as passive material, and plastic scintillating tiles as active material. The tiles are read out by **W**ave-**L**ength-**S**hifter fibres (**WLS**), which lead the signal to photomultiplier tubes (PMT's) [2].

The nominal luminosity (\({\cal L}=10^{34}cm^{-2}s^{-1}\)) at which the detectors must operate at LHC, imposes stringent requirements in the detector components concerning radiation damage. High dose levels of ionizing radiation are expected, especially in the inner detectors and calorimeters.

From Monte-Carlo simulation using the FLUKA package in combination with DTUJET code, it was estimated that, in 10 years of LHC at nominal luminosity, the maximum total dose in Tilecal is in the extended barrel and is of the order of 36 krad, (26 krad due to charged particles and 10 kraddue to the neutron flux that was considered as an average over the calorimeter) [3][4]. A new simulation was performed in 2005 [5] showing a slightly smaller total ionization dose (20 krad), but the maximum dose coming from the neutron flux is about three times higher, resulting in a maximum total dose of the order of 50 krad in the same 10 years of operation of LHC at nominal luminosity.

In the case of the scenarios proposed for the LHC upgrade, the Super LHC, the expected doses further increase by a factor up to 10 times the yearly dose expected in LHC at nominal luminosity. Current scenarios to estimate the radiation dose expected at the detectors include 3 years of LHC operation at low luminosity, followed by 5 years at nominal luminosity and 5 years at Super LHC luminosity. The maximum total dose expected in Tilecal in these operating conditions is of the order of 290 krad for the 13 years of operation taken into account.

These high dose levels impose the use of detector components which are radiation hard, to guarantee the survival of the calorimeter during at least 10 years of LHC operation (scenario used at the time of the selection of components to equip Tilecal) or the 13 years of LHC and Super LHC operation that are taken into account in the current scenarios. One important task was the study and selection of radiation hard components for the detectors. In the Tilecal calorimeter, the sensitive parts are the optical components, essentially the scintillator tiles and WLS fibres.

It is well known that plastic scintillators and WLS fibres are degraded by the passage of ionizing radiation, decreasing their light yield and attenuation length and therefore decreasing their overall light output. As a consequence, detectors made of plastic scintillators that are designed to operate in high dose radiation environments of present and future colliders, will lose performance along the time.

In the framework of the Tilecal/ATLAS collaboration, a R&D has been carried out to test the radiation hardness of scintillating tiles and WLS fibres envisaged to be used in the hadronic calorimeter.

In this paper, it is reviewed the radiation damage tests on WLS fibres which were carried out between 1997 and 1999. Five irradiations were performed during that period, to fibres from three producers: Bicron, Kuraray and Pol.Hi.Tech. The evolution of the optical properties and radiation hardness of the fibres between different productions is followed. This work was developed in close collaboration with Bicron, Kuraray and Pol.Hi.Tech, the 3 companies candidates to supply the WLS fibres to Tilecal. The fibres chosen to equip the calorimeter are the Kuraray Y11(200)MSJ.

The fibres used in these experiments have a polystyrene core doped with proprietary wave-length shifter and single or double cladding of PMMA (inner cladding) and fluorinated-PMMA (outer cladding). The fibres diameter is 1 mm.

## 2 Strategy for the analysis

The degradation of the optical properties of fibres is usually quantified by the ratio between the light output after and before the irradiation. In the past, a parametrization of this ratio which deconvolutes the emission and transmission losses has also been used [6, 7].

The fibres used in the tests are generally 200 cm long, but in some cases the sizes were smaller, in the range 175-190 cm. Since the fibres which are equipping Tilecal range from 73 to 235 cm [2], the evaluation of the radiation damage was performed at an excitation point in the fibres 140 cm far from the PMT readout.

The degradation in emission after irradiation with a dose \(D(x)\) can be parameterized in the following way [8]:

\[I_{0}[D(x)]=I_{0}(D=0)\exp\left(-\frac{D(x)}{\delta}\right) \tag{1}\]

where \(D(x)\) is the dose at distance \(x\), \(I_{0}(D=0)\) is the light yield before irradiation (zero dose) and \(\delta\) is a parameter which characterizes the loss in emission. The loss in transmission can be parameterized by:

\[k[D(x)]=k_{0}+\alpha\times D(x) \tag{2}\]

where \(k_{0}=1/L_{att}\) is the optical absorption coefficient before irradiation and \(\alpha\) characterizes the transmission loss. \(\alpha\times D\) is the additional absorption when the fibre is submitted to a total dose \(D\).

The light output after irradiation is given by the combination of the previous effects:

\[I(x,D)=I_{0}\exp\left(-x\times k_{0}-\frac{D(x)}{\delta}-\alpha\times\int_{0} ^{x}D(s)ds\right) \tag{3}\]

Radiation hard WLS fibres are characterized by high values of \(\delta\) and low values of \(\alpha\).

Choosing a step function as shown in figure 1 for the dose profile, allows the separation of light emission loss and light transmission loss in the irradiated fibres. At the point where the step occurs, the dose rises from zero to a constant value, and the light loss is due only to the emission loss. Whilealong the plateau of constant dose, the light loss is due to the transmission loss with the emission loss remaining a constant along this region.

The fibres were analysed as follows. We measure the light output before and after the irradiation, taking in both cases the light output at a distance \(x=140\) cm (\(I(140)\)) and the effective attenuation length for distances \(x~{}>~{}70\) cm from a single exponential fit. We extract the following two parameters:

\[R(x=140)=\frac{\frac{I_{irr}(x=140)}{\frac{I_{irr}(x=140)}{I_{irr}(30)}}}{\frac {I_{irr}(30)}{I_{irr}(30)}} \tag{4}\]

The subscripts (\(irr\), \(nirr\)) stand for irradiated and non-irradiated, the point at 30 cm is used for normalization purposes, since it is in the region with negligible dose.

The transmission loss, parametrized by \(\alpha\), is evaluated through equation 2:

\[\alpha=\frac{\Delta k}{D}=\frac{1}{D}\left(\frac{1}{L_{att}^{irr}}-\frac{1}{L_ {att}^{nirr}}\right) \tag{5}\]

We do not evaluate the emission loss parameter (\(\gamma\)) because, as it will be seen and discussed below, its contribution to the total light loss is very small and the respective values present large relative uncertainties.

The ratio \(R(140)\) evaluates the combined light output loss in transmission and in emission. In order to evaluate the light output degradation due to transmission loss, \(R_{pred}(x=140)\) is calculated:

Figure 1: Envisaged dose profile, including an unirradiated part with zero dose in the first 50 cm of fibre, followed by a step to a plateau of constant dose.

\[R_{pred}(x=140)=\exp\left(-\alpha\times\int_{50}^{x=140}D(s)ds\right) \tag{6}\]

where the limits of the integral are based on the dose profile shown in figure 1. The contribution of the transmission loss to the total light output degradation is obtained comparing \(R(140)\) and \(R_{pred}(140)\).

## 3 Irradiation setup and dosimetry

### Irradiation setup

The irradiation setup is shown in fig. 2, consisting of a \({}^{60}Co\) source from a radiosterilisation facility, located at _"Unidade de Tecnologias de Radiacao"_ (UTR) in the _"Instituto Tecnologico e Nuclear"_ (ITN), Lisbon.

Several cylinders containing chips of \({}^{60}Co\) constitute the source. The intensity is very high (\(>\)25 krad/h at \(\sim 10\) cm from the source), and several shielding of lead and cooper were built in order to uniformise the dose rate in an area of about 20x150 cm\({}^{2}\) and obtain the profiles shown in figure 1.

The first shielding is the steel support of the source, followed by a 9 mm lead plate. Irradiation position \(A\) has a shield made of a variable thickness lead plate with thickness decreasing from bottom to top (as shown in fig. 3

Figure 2: Irradiation facility setup. Schematic view of the \({}^{60}Co\) source, shieldings and support structures for the fibres in the 3 irradiation positions.

left), followed by a 3 mm cooper plate. The fibres are inserted in 1 cm diameter aluminium tubes, whose ends are buried in 3 mm thick lead tubes and in a 5 cm thick lead casing (see fig. 3-right).

Irradiation positions \(B\) and \(C\) have similar shield structures as position \(A\), but the thickness of the lead plates is constant, 1.5 cm for position \(B\) and 2 cm for position \(C\).

### Dosimetry of the irradiation setup

The dosimetry of the irradiation setup was performed with Elcugray alanine cables (4.8 mm diameter), in June 1995. Three 2 m long alanine cables were inserted in the aluminium tubes, in the same positions of the fibres under test, and irradiated during 73 hours. The alanine cables were then cut in 3 cm long pieces, and the total dose deposited in each piece was measured by electron spin resonance (ESR) [9], obtaining the dose profile for each position.

The dose profiles obtained are the following:

* Position A: a negligible dose rate (\(<\)200 rad/h) between 0 and 50 cm and a mean dose rate of 3.92 krad/h in the plateau from 50 to 200 cm, with a \(RMS\) of 0.54 krad/h (13.8%).
* Position B: a negligible dose rate (\(<\)30 rad/h) between 0 and 50 cm and a mean dose rate of 1.14 krad/h in the plateau from 50 to 200 cm, with a \(RMS\) of 0.12 krad/h (10.5%).
* Position C: a negligible dose rate (\(<\)30 rad/h) between 0 and 50 cm and a mean dose rate of 0.52 krad/h in the plateau from 50 to 200 cm, with a \(RMS\) of 0.05 krad/h (8.6%).

Figure 4 shows the dose rate measured with the alanine cables as a function of the height in the irradiation facility, for positions \(A\), \(B\) and \(C\).

## 4 Measurement setup - _The Fibrometer_

The test bench consists of a X-Y MicroControl optical table, provided with two independent movements driven by two stepping motors along orthogonal directions (**X** and **Y**). It is complemented by a light readout system. A 3 meter long table supports a removable holder that contains the fibres to be tested. Each fibre is positioned in front of the light readout, and one of the motors moves the radiation source along the fibre length. At each position the light output from that fibre is recorded. The test bench is automatically Figure 4: Dose profiles for positions \(A\) (top), \(B\) (center) and \(C\) (bottom).

controlled by a Personal Computer through a GPIB interface. A dedicated software was developed for this purpose using the LabView1 package.

## 5 Experimental conditions and fibres for the several irradiations

### Experimental conditions

The list of the fibres which were irradiated in each irradiation is shown in table 1. All fibres were polished one by one in a cutting machine. The opposite side of the readout PMT was painted black.

The first irradiation of this series was done in July 1997 [10]. Five fibres of each type were measured and irradiated. The irradiation was performed in the middle position of the setup, position \(B\) in figure 2. The irradiation lasted for 223 hours, and the average dose in the plateau, after correction for the source decay was 171 Krad.

The second irradiation was done in November 1998. Five fibres of each type were measured and irradiated. The irradiation was performed in the front position of the setup, position \(A\) in figure 2. The average dose in the plateau, after correction for the source decay, was 150 Krad corresponding to 73 hours of irradiation time.

The third irradiation was done in January 1999 [11]. The Bicron and Pol.Hi.Tech fibres used in this irradiation were produced in two preforms and were part of the tendering process to choose the fibre type which would be used to equip the Tilecal. The Kuraray fibres sent for the Tilecal tendering test did not arrive in time for this irradiation, so fibres from the previous production (September 98) were used. Ten fibres of each type were measured and irradiated. Bicron and Pol.Hi.Tech fibres were divided in two sets of 5 fibres for each preform. The irradiation was performed in the front position of the setup, position \(A\) in figure 2. The average dose in the plateau, after correction for the source decay, was 153 Krad corresponding to 77 hours of irradiation time.

The fourth irradiation was a high dose irradiation and was done in April 1999 [11, 12]. All fibres used in this irradiation correspond to the tendering phase. Eight fibres of each type were measured and irradiated. This high dose irradiation was performed in the front position of the setup, position \(A\) in figure 2. The average dose in the plateau, after correction for the source decay, was 875 Krad corresponding to 462 hours of irradiation time. The total dose delivered to the fibres in this irradiation was 5 times higher than the one of the previous irradiations.

The last irradiation was done in May 1999. Kuraray Y11(200)MSJ fibres have been choosen to equip the Tilecal calorimeter. At production time, we picked up eight 207 cm long fibres and performed an irradiation in the front position (\(A\)). A total average dose of about 203 Krad was delivered to the fibres during a 107 hours irradiation period.

### Fibres

The optical characterization of the WLS fibres is shown in table 1. For each fibre type, it is presented the production date, the length, the average light output at \(x=140\) cm and the effective attenuation length for \(x\geq 70\) cm. The light output \(I(140)\) of the Y11(200)MS fibres from the 1997 production will be used as reference for all the irradiations since these fibres were always measured in the periods in which the other tests were performed. These fibres will be referred as Y11(200)MS(97).

Figure 5 shows the light output as a function of the excitation distance to the PMT for each of the fibre types used in the 1997 irradiation. The Y11(200)MS and BCF91A MC fibres have identical light output and attenuation length, although the fibre to fibre fluctuations are higher for the BCF91A MC fibres. These fibres are the ones with the highest light output. Comparing the double and single cladding fibres of Bicron (BCF99-28 MC and BCF99-28) and Pol.Hi.Tech (S248-100 and S048-100), we observe a higher light output for double cladding fibres and a slightly higher attenuation length.

For the fibres used in the 1998 irradiation, all the Bicron (BCF) and Kuraray (Y11) have identical attenuation length and light output, except the light output of the BCF99-28 MC which is 8% lower than in the case of the Y11(200)MSJ fibres. On the other hand, the RMS fluctuations are smaller for the Kuraray fibres than for the Bicron and Pol.Hi.Tech types. The light output of the S250-100 fibres is about 30% lower than the Y11(200)MSJ and BCF99-28K MC fibres, due mainly to an attenuation length which is about 70 cm lower for the S250-100 fibres.

For the fibres used in the January 1999 irradiation, the average light output and attenuation length of the Y11 and BCF are identical, but the RMS fluctuations are much higher for the BCF fibres. This large RMS is due to a difference of 50 cm in the attenuation length between the two performs (lt12070 and lt12071) of the Bicron fibres. The S250-100 fibres present an attenuation length which is 50 cm lower than the Y11 and BCF fibres, leading to a light output 16-18% lower than those fibres.

For the fibres used in the April 1999 irradiation, the results on the optical properties are essentially the same as the ones found in the fibres used in the January 1999 irradiation since the fibres are of the same type. The only difference are the Y11 fibres which were from a newer production (January 99), and present a slightly higher attenuation length (301 cm) with respect to the former production (September 98) with \(L_{att}=\)276 cm. We make notice that the BCF91A MC fibres tested were from the lt12070 preform, which presents an attenuation length of 251 cm.

For the fibres used in the May 1999 irradiation, the optical properties of the Y11(200)MSJ fibres equipping the Tilecal are slightly better than the tendering fibres. The attenuation length is similar, \(L_{att}=\)305 cm, and the light output \(I(140)\)=1.19 is about 10% higher.

## 6 Results after irradiation - irradiation performed in 1997

\(R(140)\) (eq. 4), is shown in figure 7\(-\)\(a\). To track recovery, the fibres were measured several times after the end of the irradiation (0, 1 and 6 days). Figure 6 shows the ratio \(R(x)\) as defined in eq. 4 as a function of distance to the readout PMT.

All Bicron BCF and Kuraray Y11 fibres present similar light output losses with a ratio \(R(140)\) in the range 86-89%. No significant recovery was observed in those fibres up to 6 days after the end of the irradiation. The Sx48 Pol.Hi.Tech fibres present a higher light output degradation with respect to the Bicron and Kuraray fibres, the ratio \(R(140)\) has a value of 60% after 6 days of recovery. This value was around 52% just after the end of the irradiation.

The transmission loss parameter \(\alpha\) is presented in figure 7\(-\)\(b\). It should be noted that lower values of \(\alpha\) correspond to lower transmission degradation. Bicron BCF and Kuraray Y11 fibres present values for \(\alpha\) in the range 7-8\(\times 10^{-3}\) (Mrad cm)\({}^{-1}\), while for the Sx48 Pol.Hi.Tech fibres the \(\alpha\) value is higher: \(\sim\)28\(\times 10^{-3}\) (Mrad cm)\({}^{-1}\). The recovery behaviour of the transmission loss is similar to that of the total light output loss (\(R(140)\)) previously analysed.

The transmission loss parameter \(\alpha\) was used to calculate the ratio \(R_{pred}(140)\) (c.f. eq. 6) giving the light output degradation due to the transmission loss, see table 2. Table 3 presents a comparison between \(R(140)\) and \(R_{pred}(140)\) through their ratio. The values given by \(R(140)/R_{pred}(140)\) characterize the contribution of the transmission loss to the total light output degradation.

For BCF and Y11 fibres the ratio \(R(140)/R_{pred}(140)\) ranges between 96% and 98%, while for the Sx48 fibres is in the range 88-90%. This means that the transmission loss accounts for most of the total light output degradation and the emission loss contributes only a small part. Moreover, the fibres which present a higher degradation, the Sx48, have a lower contribution due to transmission loss than the fibres which present a lower degradation.

## 7 Irradiation performed in 1998

The average total dose in the plateau region in this irradiation was 150 krad.

The light output degradation of the WLS fibres characterized by the ratio \(R(140)\) (eq. 4), is shown in figure 10. To track recovery, the fibres were measured 4 times after the end of irradiation (after 0, 3, 7 and 10 days). Figure 9 shows the ratio \(R(x)\) as defined in eq. 4 as a function of distance to the readout PMT.

all others. The Kuraray Y11(200)MSJ fibres are the ones in which a lower degradation is observed (\(R(140)=94\%\)). All other fibre types present similar light output degradation. Bicron BCF and Kuraray Y11 fibres do not present any significant recovery up to 10 days after the end of the irradiation. The Pol.Hi.Tech S250 have a higher degradation just after the end of irradiation (\(R(140)\simeq 80\%\)) recovering to \(R(140)=90\%\). Figure 10\(-a\) shows \(R(140)\) for all fibre types as a function of measurement time after irradiation.

The transmission loss parameter \(\alpha\) is presented in figure 10\(-b\). The values for \(\alpha\) range between 4\(\times 10^{-3}\) (Mrad cm)\({}^{-1}\) for the Y11(200)MSJ fibres and 8.6\(\times 10^{-3}\) (Mrad cm)\({}^{-1}\) for the BCF99-28 MC fibres. This interval corresponds to a total light output degradation \(R(140)\) which ranges between 86.4% and 94.4% for the same fibres, indicating that \(\alpha\) is very sensitive to small variations of \(R(140)\). Furthermore, it is observed that the fluctuations in the parameter \(\alpha\) are in general higher than 10%.

The recovery behaviour of the transmission loss is similar but enhanced to what was observed for the total light output loss \(R(140)\).

The transmission loss parameter \(\alpha\) was used to calculate the ratio \(R_{pred}(140)\) (c.f. eq. 6) giving the light output degradation due to the transmission loss, see table 2. Table 3 presents a comparison between \(R(140)\) and \(R_{pred}(140)\)

through their ratio. The values given by \(R(140)/R_{pred}(140)\) characterize the contribution of the transmission loss to the total light output degradation.

The ratio \(R(140)/R_{pred}(140)\) ranges between 97.4% and 99.2% for all the fibres. As observed in the previous irradiation, the transmission loss accounts for most of the total light output degradation.

## 8 Irradiation performed in January 1999

The average total dose in the plateau region in this irradiation was 153 krad.

The light output degradation of the WLS fibres characterized by the ratio \(R(140)\) (eq. 4), is shown in figure 13. To track recovery, the fibres were measured 3 times after the end of irradiation (after 0, 1 and 6 days). Figure 12 shows the ratio \(R(x)\) as defined in eq. 4 as a function of distance to the readout PMT.

The Kuraray Y11(200)MSJ fibres are the ones in which a lower degradation is observed (\(R(140)=92\%\)) 6 days after the end of the irradiation. The Bicron BCF91A MC fibres present a higher light output loss (\(R(140)=86\%\)) and the Pol.Hi.Tech S250 are the fibres in which a higher degradation was observed (\(R(140)=81\%\)). Bicron BCF and Kuraray Y11 fibres do not present any significant recovery up to 6 days after the end of the irradiation. The Pol.Hi.Tech S250 have a higher degradation just after the end of irradiation (\(R(140)\simeq 62\%\)) recovering to \(R(140)=81\%\) after 6 days. Figure 13\(-a\) shows \(R(140)\) for all fibre types as a function of measurement time after irradiation.

The transmission loss parameter \(\alpha\) is presented in figure 13\(-b\). The values for \(\alpha\) closely follow the behaviour of \(R(140)\) for the three types of fibres, as well as their recovery behaviour.

The transmission loss parameter \(\alpha\) was used to calculate the ratio \(R_{pred}(140)\) (c.f. eq. 6) giving the light output degradation due to the transmission loss, see table 2. Table 3 presents a comparison between \(R(140)\) and \(R_{pred}(140)\) through their ratio. The values given by \(R(140)/R_{pred}(140)\) characterize the contribution of the transmission loss to the total light output degradation.

The ratio \(R(140)/R_{pred}(140)\) ranges between 95.7% and 97.8% for all the fibres. As observed in the previous irradiations, the transmission loss accounts for most of the total light output degradation, and higher light output losses correspond to smaller contributions of the transmission loss.

## 9 High dose irradiation performed in 1999

The average total dose in the plateau region in this irradiation was 875 krad.

The light output degradation of the WLS fibres characterized by the ratio \(R(140)\) (eq. 4), is shown in figure 16. To track recovery, the fibres were measured 3 times after the end of irradiation (after 0, 1 and 10 days). Figure 15 shows the ratio \(R(x)\) as defined in eq. 4 as a function of distance to the readout PMT.

As expected, due to the much higher dose in this irradiation, the light output degradation of all fibres is higher than in the previous irradiations. The Kuraray Y11(200)MSJ fibres are the ones in which the lowest degradation is observed (\(R(140)\sim 77\%\)) 10 days after the end of the irradiation. The Pol.Hi.Tech S250 fibres present a higher light output loss (\(R(140)=65\%\)) and the Bicron BCF91A MC are the fibres in which the highest degradation was observed (\(R(140)=57\%\)). No recovery was observed for the Bicron BCF91A MC fibres up to 10 days after the end of the irradiation, while the Y11(200)MSJ and S250 fibres recovered some of the light output. Figure 13\(-a\) shows \(R(140)\) for all the fibre types as a function of the measurement time after the end of the irradiation.

The transmission loss parameter \(\alpha\) is presented in figure 16\(-b\). The values

for \(\alpha\) closely follow the behaviour of \(R(140)\) for the three types of fibres, as well as their recovery behaviour. Furthermore, the values obtained for \(\alpha\) in this high dose irradiation are similar to the ones obtained in the previous (lower dose) irradiations, after about one week of recovery. This indicates that \(\alpha\) is a good parameter to evaluate the transmission loss of the fibres since at first approximation it does not dependent on the total dose.

The transmission loss parameter \(\alpha\) was used to calculate the ratio \(R_{pred}(140)\) (c.f. eq. 6) giving the light output degradation due to the transmission loss, see table 2. Table 3 presents a comparison between \(R(140)\) and \(R_{pred}(140)\) through their ratio. The values given by \(R(140)/R_{pred}(140)\) characterize the contribution of the transmission loss to the total light output degradation.

The ratio \(R(140)/R_{pred}(140)\) ranges between 92% and 95% for all the fibres. These lower values with respect to the previous irradiations confirm that higher light output losses correspond to smaller contributions of the transmission loss.

plots (\(b\)) show the corresponding parameter \(\alpha\), for all irradiations. On the top of each plot it is shown the irradiation period, and on the bottom the type of fibre and production/arrival date of the fibres to our laboratory. Figure 17 corresponds to the Kuraray fibres, figure 18 corresponds to the Bicron fibres and figure 19 corresponds to the Pol.Hi.Tech fibres that were tested.

Starting with the Kuraray fibres (figure 17), it was observed that the Y11(200)MSJ fibres present slightly lower degradation than the Y11(200)MS UVA fibres, which is translated not only in slightly higher values of \(R(140)\) but also lower values of \(\alpha\) in the case of MSJ fibres. Moreover, the radiation resistance properties of the Y11(200)MSJ practically did not change since their first production for Tilecal (September 1998). The value of \(\alpha\) obtained in the high dose irradiation (April 99, figure 17-\(b\)) is compatible with the ones obtained with lower doses, providing a good confidence in the model described by eq. 2.

Bicron fibres (figure 18) present in general slightly higher degradation than the Kuraray fibres. Along several productions and types of fibres, the fibres radiation hardness was maintained at the same level, the values of \(R(140)\) and \(\alpha\) are of the same order for all the types of fibres produced by Bicron. The only exception was the BCF99-28KMC fibres from the March 1998 production which presented a lower degradation with respect to the other types.

Pol.Hi.Tech with the S250 fibres (figure 19) reached a level of radiation hardness at the level of the Kuraray and Bicron types.

With a total dose about 3-4 times higher than the expected in 10 years of LHC operation at nominal luminosity, the measured fibres light loss is of the order of 10%, and even when the total dose is 20 times the expected in 10 LHC years the light loss increases only to the level of 25%. With these numbers we conclude that the fibres chosen to equip Tilecal, the Kuraray Y11(200)MSJ are able to survive to the radiation dose expected in LHC operation during 10 years at nominal luminosity.
