## 1 Introduction

The first-level ATLAS muon trigger is based on fast, finely segmented, detectors to identify penetrating charged particles pointing to the interaction region [1]. The intrinsic time resolution of the detectors should be much smaller than the bunch crossing period. Given the configuration of the experiment, the trigger is divided in three different regions:

1. the barrel detectors in the central toroid, \(\mid\eta\mid<1.05\);
2. the end-cap detectors behind the central toroid, \(1.05<\mid\eta\mid<1.55\) (transition region);
3. the detectors behind the end-cap toroids, \(1.55<\mid\eta\mid<2.2\).

To cope with the different levels of particle flux and the requirements on space resolution, we propose to use Resistive Plate Chambers [2] (RPC) in the barrel and Thin-Gap wire Chambers [3] (TGC) in the end-cap. In both detectors the signal is read out on electrodes segmented in logical strips with an intrinsic time resolution of \(<2\,ns\) (RPC) and \(<5\,ns\) (TGC).

The transverse momentum selection is done with a fast coincidence between strips on different planes. The number of trigger planes is defined by the need to minimize the rate of accidental coincidences and to optimize the efficiency. Accidental coincidences are due to the high level of random hits in the detector produced by low energy photons and neutrons. To reduce the accidental rate to a level lower than the prompt muon rate, it is proposed to implement the trigger in two projections, \(r-z\) and \(r-\phi\). Thus the trigger detectors will also be used to provide the coordinate in the non-bending plane ( \(r-\phi\) ) to the muon tracking system.

In the barrel each RPC plane is equipped with read-out strips on either side of the gas volume: z-strips parallel to the magnetic field of the central toroid and \(\phi\)-strips parallel to the beam. In the endcap the TGC planes have wires parallel to the main component of the magnetic field and radial strips. The trigger concept is outlined in Fig.1 and 2.

## 2 Trigger algorithm implementation

In the barrel (\(|\eta\ |<1.05\)) we propose to use three trigger stations, two located close to the middle muon chambers and one located close to the external muon chambers. The middle stations (BM) are each made of two RPC planes and the external station (BO) is made of three RPC planes. The low-\(p_{T}\) trigger requires a threefold majority coincidence of the four middle planes, while the high-\(p_{T}\) trigger requires a twofold majority coincidence of the three external planes and the low-\(p_{T}\) trigger.

A similar scheme is implemented in the end-cap regions (\(1.05<\mid\eta\ |<2.2\ ). Here the trigger chambers are located outside the toroids with a distance between the trigger planes smaller than in the barrel, due to the limited available space. This, and the higher level of background, leads to a change in technology for the trigger detectors which is achieved by the use of Thin-Gap wire Chambers. TGCs offer fine granularity and flexible segmentation as well as fast response and two coordinate readout. Wires parallel to the magnetic field measure the polar angle after the toroids and radial strips measure the azimuthal angle. The higher momenta and the smaller lever arm require a finer segmentation than in the barrel. The use of narrow coincidence roads also reduces the background to the trigger due to random hits in the chambers. As in the barrel, we propose to use three trigger stations: two stations, each made of two TGC planes, are spaced by about 0.3 m and select muons with low \(p_{T}\) threshold; a third station made of three TGC planes located at about 1.5 m distance selects muons with a higher \(p_{T}\) threshold.

A description of the strip signal amplifier and of the discriminator is presented in Sect.12. In the following we assume that the discriminated signals of the individual strips have 20 ns width.

The trigger logic is done with a dedicated coincidence matrix circuit based on an ASIC whose prototype is under development within the RD27 collaboration [4]. The \(X-Y\) inputs to the coincidence matrix are given by the discriminated and shaped signals from the RPC/TGC strips of different planes. The transverse momentum threshold is defined by a road in the matrix and a trigger signal is generated when there is a valid coincidence within the road (Fig. 3). The combination of trigger planes and the size of the road are fully programmable. Three threshold settings can be used simultaneously in one coincidence matrix. The low- and high-\(p_{T}\) triggers are done by two identical matrices programmed in different ways to perform the required majority logic of trigger planes.

## 3 Coincidence matrix ASIC

A coincidence matrix demonstrator ASIC is being developed by the RD27 collaboration [5]. The size of the matrix is \(8\times 24\) and the circuit can operate with two different thresholds. To implement the low- and high-\(p_{T}\) triggers we use two ASICs. Fig.4 shows the basic cell of the matrix circuit and the programming scheme of the logic (\(T_{j,k}\) are the trigger planes) is outlined in Table 1.

\end{table}

Fig.5 shows the connections of the RPC/TGC strips to the front-end electronics, the coincidence matrix and the read-out. Fig.6 shows how the coincidence matrices are connected to generate the trigger.

For the low-\(p_{T}\) trigger the inputs are the four middle RPC/TGC planes (\(T_{1}\) and \(T_{2}\)) and the logic is a 3/4 majority coincidence. For the high-\(p_{T}\) trigger the inputs are the three external RPC/TGC planes (\(T_{3}\)) and the confirmed output of the first matrix, the logic is a (2/3 majority coincidence) \(\times\) (low-\(p_{T}\)). To compensate for different propagation times of the signals from different detector planes, the delays of each group of \(X\) and \(Y\) inputs to the coincidence matrix can be adjusted inside the circuit with programmable micropipeline delays. The clock to the micropipelines, derived from the main 40 MHz clock, will run at 160 or 320 MHz.

The demonstrator prototype of the coincidence matrix ASIC has been developed using a gate-array from Fujitsu in \(0.5\mu m\) CMOS technology. The use of this technology allows an internal jitter of the circuit smaller than 2-3 ns and low power consumption. The first prototypes of the ASIC will be avalaible early in 1995.

The final design of the ASIC for the ATLAS first-level muon trigger will be most probably developed in the same technology. The size of the matrix will probably be \(32\times 48\) and the circuit will operate with three different thresholds simultaneously.

## 4 Bunch-crossing identification and system synchronization

The time resolution of the first-level trigger system should be much smaller than the bunch crossing period of 25 ns. Thus it is mandatory to use fast detectors and precise timing circuits. A preliminary test has been done with the RD5 experimental set-up. In the test, the outputs of two RPC planes were sent to a coincidence matrix built with very fast GaAs commercial components [6]. The system used a clock of 133 MHz frequency and the measured time resolution of the coincidence was well below 25 ns [7].

Figure 5: Connection of the RPC/TGC strips to the front-end and trigger electronics.

A smearing of the time resolution is introduced by the propagation time of the signal along the strips (\(5\ ns/m\)). In the largest chambers of the barrel we plan to use \(\phi\) strips of length \(\Delta z\simeq\ 1m\), \(\Delta t<3\ ns\), and z-strips of length \(\Delta r\phi=2-3\ m\), \(\Delta t<7\ ns\) (see Appendix). Projectivity in this plane insures a strong correlation of the signal propagation times on different trigger stations (see Fig.1). The absolute trigger timing will be defined by the shorter strips.

The identification of the bunch crossing is done by latching the main clock with the coincidence matrix output. For the synchronization of the system, we plan to make a logical subdivision of the muon trigger detectors in timing zones (Fig.7) such that the propagation time of the clock signal within each zone is equal to or smaller than one bunch crossing period. To compensate for the different times of flight of particles, additional programmable delays will be added to the clock signal to keep all coincidence matrices in phase.

## 5 Trigger segmentation and Regions of Interest

Due to the configuration of the magnetic field in the central and forward toroids, the trigger segmentation will be different in the barrel and in the end-cap regions. In the barrel there are 24 \(\phi\) sectors and each sector is segmented in about 20 coincidence matrices. Thus each coincidence matrix defines a RoI of \(\Delta\phi\times\Delta\eta=0.25\times 0.10\). A possible scheme of the trigger segmentation and connections of the coincidence matrices in the barrel region is presented in the Appendix. In the end-cap there are 32 \(\phi\) sectors with a similar segmentation in \(\eta\). The whole trigger system will be divided into four regions, two half-barrel and two end-caps, and in \(2\times 24+2\times 32=112\) sectors. The output of the trigger will contain the information of the bunch-crossing number, the \(p_{T}\) threshold and the RoI location.

Figure 6: Scheme of implementation of the low- and high-\(p_{T}\) trigger.

## 6 Lay out of the trigger electronics

In order to minimize the cable length and the trigger latency, the coincidence matrices will be distributed along the apparatus on printed circuit boards attached to the external trigger detectors. The signals from the internal detector planes will be sent to the coincidence matrices via cables that introduce a delay slightly larger than the time of flight of particles. Differences of the delays of the signals will be compensated in the coincidence matrix. The information from the coincidence matrices of each sector will be collected by a local Sector Muon Trigger located at the centre of the detector as shown in Fig.8. The outputs of the sector triggers will be sent via optical links to the Central Muon Trigger that generates the global muon trigger information that is passed to the Level-1 Central Trigger Processor. To minimize cable length, the two processors will be located in the same place.

## 7 Data format

For each bunch crossing, the 112 local sector triggers generate a 32-bit word with the following information:

* number of trigger tracks in the sector (2-bit, max = 2);
* RoI for each track (2 \(\times\) 4-bit);
* \(p_{T}\) threshold for each track (2 \(\times\) 2-bit for either low- and high-\(p_{T}\) matrix)
* T0 counter (8-bit)

The other 6 bits can be used to transfer additional information.

Figure 7: Timing zones of the distribution of the main clock (average time of flight is indicated in bunch crossing periods)

## 8 Optical link

Optical links will connect the Sector Muon Trigger to the Central Muon Trigger. We are investigating the use of a 32-bit, 1 GHz optical link based on a GaAs transceiver chip whose prototype has been already developed and tested in Rome. The chip will be commercially available in few months. Two links per trigger sector, for a total of 224 links, working at an effective bandwidth of 800 Mbit/s can be used to transfer the complete trigger information.

We are also evaluating the possibility to transfer in asynchronous mode only the bunch crossings containing a valid trigger. In this way the number of links will be reduced but at expense of an increase in complexity of the system.

## 9 The Central Muon Trigger Logic

This logic will concentrate all the informations transferred by the 112 sectors and will produce the muon multiplicity of the muon trigger. The logic will be located close to the Calorimeter Trigger Logic to allow the generation of the global first level trigger without additional delay.

The hardware will be implemented using five 9U VME boards, each containing 48 optical receivers. The outputs of the receivers are combined to generate the global multiplicity and its associated information.

## 10 Trigger latency

We have evaluated the latency of the trigger system in the following way:

Figure 8: Cabling scheme of the coincidence matrices.

\begin{tabular}{|l|r|r|} \hline  & n s & b.c. \\ \hline particle time of flight & 50 & 2 \\ \hline local logic (shaping time, signal propagation, coincidence matrix) & 100 & 4 \\ \hline sector logic processing time & 175 & 7 \\ \hline central logic processing time & 175 & 7 \\ \hline cable delay (\(2\times 75\ m\)) & 750 & 30 \\ \hline total & 1250 & 50 \\ \hline \end{tabular}

For the Sector Muon Trigger and the Central Muon Trigger we don't have yet a well defined design: the evaluation of the delays derives from our previous experience. The \(2\times 75\ m\) of cable are used to connect the outermost part of the detector to the Central Muon Trigger and to send back the trigger signal to the muon chambers. The total delay is well below the goal of \(2\ \mu s\) foreseen for the ATLAS first level trigger latency.

## 11 Timing

Timing is a critical issue in the muon trigger since the detectors extend over a very large area and the propagation time between different regions can be several bunch-crossing periods. Also the time of flight of particles in different regions can be of the same order of the bunch-crossing period.

The trigger system needs the distribution of the main clock over about 4000 points. We will make use of the Timing Control and Distribution system [8] developed in the framework of the RD-12 and RD-27 experiments. We have also considered the need for a timing calibration system to determine the correct settings for the programmable delays used in our bunch-crossing identification and synchronisation system and the possibility to generate artificial triggers for calibrating the electronics. In addition, we will include time interpolators, synchronous with the main clock and running at four or eight times its frequency. The value of the time interpolator will provide a more precise timing of the trigger signal within the bunch-crossing period. It will be possible to correct the timing of the trigger system by analysing the time interpolator data and by adjusting the programmable delays.

## 12 Front-end electronics

Progress has been made during the last years to improve the performance of RPCs at large particle flux. Good efficiency and time resolution, up to about \(1\ kHz/cm^{2}\), have been obtained with RPCs operated at a gas amplification of \(10^{6}-10^{7}\) with particle beams [9] and under continuous and uniform irradiation of photons and neutrons [10]. The time response shows a very small increase with the rate (\(\sim 1\ ns/kHz\ cm^{-2}\) ) and is characterized by the absence of non gaussian tails. The signal collected on the pick-up strips has the following properties:charge \(\simeq\ 1\ pC\) duration \(\simeq 10\ ns\) time resolution \(\simeq 1\ ns\) These performance has been obtained with a large gain \(\times\) bandwidth amplifier. Improved timing performance has also been obtained with TGCs using the same amplifier.

We propose to develop a front-end electronics based on a GaAs ASIC that could be used with both type of detectors employed in the muon trigger. The choice of the GaAs technology is based on its superior time characteristics. The ASIC will contain 8 or 16 fast amplifiers with adjustable gain, followed by a low hysteresis Schmitt trigger and a shaper with programmable width and dead time. The output of each channel will be connected to a shift register for serial or parallel read out. The characteristics of the present design are: technology GaAs number of channels 8 or 16 amplification adjustable up to 40 db threshold adjustable in 0.5 - 50 mV Prototypes of the amplifier have been tested with RPCs and TGCs. The design of a monolythic circuit is in progress and the first prototype of the ASIC should be available at the end of 1995.

## 13 Read-out of the trigger detectors

The RPCs will be segmented in about 360 000 strips (see Appendix). With a typical area of 800 \(cm^{2}\) and an average rate of 30 \(Hz\ cm^{-2}\) (Sec.18), there will be on average \(6\cdot 10^{-4}\) hits per strip in one bunch crossing period, i.e. less than 1000 strips hit per event. The TGCs will be segmented in about 480 000 strips with a typical area of 100 \(cm^{-2}\): the number of strips hit per event is similar. Thus the amount of data to read out is modest.

At the present stage the read-out system of the trigger detectors is not yet defined in detail. We know, however, that it should provide the information of the strip clusters both in the z and \(\phi\) projections and should contain all the facilities for testing, calibrating and on-line monitoring of the trigger system.

## 14 Interface to Level-2

This interface must send to the second level trigger the information concerning every track triggered by the first level. This information concerns the RoI identifier, the \(p_{T}\) threshold and the bunch-crossing number. A detailed study of this interface is in progress and we will produce a complete design rather soon.

Cosmic ray trigger

A completely standalone and asynchronous system can trigger on penetrating cosmic ray muons pointing to the interaction region. Operation with this trigger during off-beam time can be very useful for tests of the central tracker, the calorimeters and the muon detectors. The lower sectors will have the correct timing. To allow the upper sectors to participate in the trigger there is need to adjust the coincidence matrices input delays by twice the time interval between the trigger stations (25 ns maximum, at the end of the barrel).

## 16 Segmentation of the trigger planes

Referring to Fig.1 and 2, the size of the trigger window to select muons with transverse momentum larger than \(p_{T}\) is a function of the field integral, the distance of the trigger planes and the polar angle:

\[w_{barrel}\simeq\frac{a}{\rho p_{T}\,\sin\,^{2}\Theta}\]

\[w_{endcap}\simeq\frac{b}{\rho p_{T}\,\cos\,^{2}\Theta}\]

where \(\rho p_{T}\) is the value of the transverse momentum after traversing the calorimeter (\(\rho\simeq\) independent of \(\Theta\)). Smearing effects are due to:

* fluctuations of the energy loss in the calorimeter;
* length of the p-p interaction region;
* multiple scattering in the calorimeter;
* \(\phi\) non uniformity of the magnetic field.

The first effect is important at low values of \(p_{T}\), the second at large values of \(p_{T}\), while the other two are independent of \(p_{T}\) and of comparable size. In the following we will indicate 6 and 20 GeV/c as the nominal threshold values for the low- and high-\(p_{T}\) trigger respectively. These values match well the physics requirements for detecting semileptonic decays of charm and beauty quarks (low-\(p_{T}\)) and decays of W and Z bosons (high-\(p_{T}\)). The first level muon trigger can however select muons with large flexibility. For muons of \(p_{T}=6\) (20) GeV/c, the effects listed above contribute a smearing in the displacement on the low-\(p_{T}\) (high-\(p_{T}\)) trigger planes between 3 and 7 \(cm\) when moving from the centre to the end of the barrel and between 0.5 and 1.5 \(cm\) in the end-cap. Thus a segmentation of the trigger planes in strips of 3 - 4 \(cm\) width in the barrel and 1 \(cm\) width in the end-cap is a balanced choice between good selectivity and number of channels.

The size of the trigger windows and the acceptance of the trigger have been computed [11] with the proposed segmentation of the detectors and a 3-D map of the magnetic field in the toroids. Fig.9 shows, as a function of \(\eta\), the size of the trigger window of the low-\(p_{T}\) (high-\(p_{T}\)) trigger that selects with 90% efficiency muons with transverse momentum larger than 6 GeV/c (20 GeV/c). Fig.10 shows the trigger acceptance as a function of \(p_{T}\) for the above trigger thresholds.

In the transverse plane muons are deflected in the field of the central solenoid and of the return yoke. Even if the flux in the return yoke is not uniform, the effect of multiple scattering in the calorimeter is larger than the displacement due to the bending. At the nominal trigger thresholds, two points measured on the trigger stations along the muon trajectory are aligned with the interaction region within \(2-3\)_cm_ in the barrel and within 1_cm_ in the end-cap. In this projection, the width of the strips is determined by the precision required for the alignement of the drift chambers and for correcting for the \(\phi\) non uniformity of the field in the toroid. Again segmentation in strips of \(3-4\)_cm_ width in the barrel and 1_cm_ in the end-cap is adequate.

## 17 Efficiency of the trigger coincidence

The low-\(p_{T}\) trigger is done with a 3/4 majority coincidence and the high-\(p_{T}\) trigger with a \(3/4\times 2/3\) majority coincidence. Assuming a typical size of the trigger chambers of 2_m\({}^{2}\)_, the fraction of insensitive area due to the frames and the spacers is about \(3\cdot 10^{-2}\). Allowing for dead areas due to the support structure, we assume a fraction of sensitive area \(f=0.96\). In the sensitive area, the trigger detectors have efficiency very close to 1. The trigger coincidence efficiency is given in Table 2

Figure 9: Size of the trigger window as a function of \(\eta\).

as a function of the average working efficiency, \(<\varepsilon>\), assuming full correlation of the response of the \(z-\) and \(\phi\)-strips. The two values correspond to the case of full correlation of the insensitive areas along the particle trajectory and to the case of no correlation.

## 18 Trigger rates

The integral cross section for inclusive muon production [12] is shown in Fig.11 as a function of the \(p_{T}\) threshold. Taking into account the detectors coverage and the effect of the trigger threshold, the inclusive muon rate for a 6 GeV/c \(p_{T}\) threshold at a luminosity of \(10^{33}\ cm^{-2}\ s^{-1}\) is about 4 \(kHz\) from charm and beauty semileptonic decays and about 4 \(kHz\) from in-flight \(\pi\) and \(K\) decays and punchthrough muons. For a 20 GeV/c \(p_{T}\) threshold at a luminosity of \(10^{34}\ cm^{-2}\ s^{-1}\), the trigger rate due to heavy quarks, W and Z decays is about 4 \(kHz\).

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|} \hline \(f\) & \(<\varepsilon>\) & low-\(p_{T}\) trigger & high-\(p_{T}\) trigger \\ \hline
0.96 & 1.0 & 0.960 - 0.991 & 0.960 - 0.986 \\ \hline
0.96 & 0.96 & 0.951 - 0.967 & 0.947 - 0.950 \\ \hline
0.96 & 0.92 & 0.927 - 0.930 & 0.910 - 0.895 \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 2: Efficiency of the trigger coin ciden ce

Figure 10: Trigger acceptance as a function of \(p_{T}\).

A large contribution to the trigger rate can be due to accidental coincidences produced by low energy photons and neutrons. The flux and the energy spectrum has been studied in detail in various shielding configurations [13]. The detector rate per unit area is derived convoluting the energy spectrum with the detector sensitivity. The latter has been measured with photons and neutrons of energies around 1 MeV [10] and found in good agreement with the simulation result [13].

We divide the background induced rates in two classes:

* uncorrelated background, due to accidental coincidences of hits on different trigger planes;
* correlated background, due to charged particles (mostly electrons) that traverse two or more trigger planes.

The rate per unit area, averaged over the trigger coverage, is presented in the following table for a luminosity of \(10^{34}\)\(cm^{-2}\)\(s^{-1}\).

Rate per unit area of the trigger planes \((Hz/cm^{2})\)

Figure 11: Inclusive muon cross section as a function of the transverse momentum threshold in \(|\eta\)\(|<1\)

To evaluate the trigger rate, we assume an average window size of 40 (15) \(cm\) in the \(r-z\) projection and 10 (5) \(cm\) in the \(r-\phi\) projection in the barrel (end-cap) and a coincidence time of 20 \(ns\). The trigger rate in the barrel is shown in Fig.12 and 13 as a function of the luminosity for the low-\(p_{T}\) and high-\(p_{T}\) trigger configurations together with the rate of muons from light mesons, heavy quarks, W and Z decays.

A dangerous background is due to energetic electrons compton-scattered close to the low-\(p_{T}\) trigger stations that are able to produce a threefold coincidence. At present, this effect is not reliably simulated. For this reason, we also show in Fig.12 and 13 the trigger rate obtained increasing the background level by a factor of 5 (10) for the low-\(p_{T}\) (high-\(p_{T}\)) trigger. The high level of coincidence and the intrinsic good time resolution of the detectors insure that the accidental coincidence rate is well below the prompt muon signal rate.

## 19 Appendix

In this appendix we present a scheme of segmentation of the trigger detectors in the barrel. The work for the end-cap is in progress. The presence of a large radial component of the magnetic field in the transition region and close to the coils in the forward toroids makes the study of the chamber segmentation more difficult than in the barrel.

The trigger detectors in the barrel are segmented in 24 \(\phi\) sectors: \(2\times 8\) between the coils (large sectors) and 8 close to the coils (small sectors). The detector planes

Figure 12: Low-\(p_{T}\) trigger rate in \(|\,\eta\)\(|<1.05\) as a function of the luminosity

are located at radii \(r_{2}\simeq 7\)\(m\) and \(r_{3}\simeq 10\)\(m\) and are segmented in a projective way along the \(z\) axis. No matter what is the actual segmentation of the detectors, the \(z\)-strips are connected to the coincidence matrices in a way that depends on the width of the trigger window for the minimum \(p_{T}\) threshold, the width of the strips and the size of the coincidence matrix. Since in the \(r-\phi\) projection muon tracks are roughly colinear with the origin, the division in trigger matrices follows the geometry of the \(\phi\)-sectors.

The segmentation scheme presented in the following is consistent, but for small differences, with the conventions adopted for the 2nd level trigger [14].

Tables 4 and 5 gives the size of the RPCs, the width of the strips in both projections for the BM and BO trigger stations. The chosen segmentation follows the general criteria outlined in Sect.16:

* projective geometry and good modularity;
* efficient reduction of accidental coincidences;
* strip width \(\ll\) trigger window size in \(\eta\);
* good resolution in the \(r-\phi\) projection.
