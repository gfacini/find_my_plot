**Abstract**

In order to fulfil to technical and physical requirements, the photomultiplier blocks of the tile hadron calorimeter of ATLAS have to be classified in sets corresponding to different types of cells. This note presents the constraints that should be taken into account. On the basis of the characterisation of 500 tubes, it appears that the main parameter is the nominal high voltage of photomultipliers. Three sets have been defined: one for barrel like drawers and two for extended barrel ones. At the end, the filling of each drawer with photomultiplier blocks belonging to the different sets is discussed.

## 1. Tile hadron calorimeter set up

### 1.1 General set up

The ATLAS hadron tile calorimeter of ATLAS is made of 64 similar parts surrounding the beam axis (\(\Delta\phi=2\pi/64\) ) and of 2 equivalent sides along the beam axis (positive and negative values of \(\eta\) ). Taking these symmetries into account, the study can be restricted to \(1/128^{th}\) of the calorimeter. In this way, it remains only 4 different types of drawers: 2 for central barrel (long barrel: LB), and 2 for extended barrels (EB). Figure 1 shows the different types of cells [1]. Cells D4 and C10 are calorimeter plugs. Cells E1 to E4 are scintillators: E1 and E2 for the gap area, E3 and E4 for the crack one. In table 1, the number of necessary photomultipliers for each type of drawer is reported. A total of 9856 photomultipliers will be needed to fill the whole calorimeter. Spare modules will be also equipped requiring 154 additional photomultipliers.

### 1.2 Special modules

Because of interference with various services, there are some special modules [2]. Out of them, 16 have an impact on this study: modules #39, #40, #41, #42, #55, #56, #57, and #58 of extended barrels (sides A and C). For each of them, cell C10 is made of a 20mm thickness scintillator instead of the usual plug.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|} \hline Drawer & Number of PMTs & Number of PMTs \\ \hline LB internal & 24 & 45 \\ \hline LB external & 21 & 32 \\ \hline EB external & 10 & \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}

### 1.3 Nominal gains

The nominal gain of the photomultipliers has been fixed to \(10^{5}\) for the all calorimeter cells [3]. In this study, it was assumed to be \(\,2\!\times\!10^{5}\) for gap scintillators cells (E1 and E2) and for special cells C10 of previous chapter (16/128 ), and \(\,3\!\times\!10^{5}\,\) for crack scintillators cells (E3 and E4). The corresponding numbers of photomultipliers are reported in table 2.

## 2 High voltage constraints

### 2.1 High voltage source

The high voltage source (\(HV_{in}\)) is the same for all a super-drawer. The two different possible values are shown in table 3[4].

### 2.2 High voltage regulation

Because of the photomultiplier intrinsic characteristics and of the optical fluctuations from cell to cell, each photomultiplier is supplied by a different high voltage. The appropriate high voltage (\(HV_{ces}\)) is provided by a front-end high voltage regulation system using opto-couplers [4]. This system is linear over its full range: from \(HV_{in}-(360\!\pm\!24)\,\)Volts up to \(HV_{in}-1\,\)Volt. The \(\,\pm\,24\,\)Volts corresponds to a min to max value due to the tolerance on Zener diodes used in the regulation, so the range is at least: \(HV_{in}-336\,\)Volts to \(HV_{in}-1\,\)Volt. However, from regulation point of view, it is convenient to remove \(\,5\,\)Volts at both sides. Taking into account the appropriate safety factors, the radiation hardness of the regulation system is sufficient for the expected radiation rate [4, 5]. Nevertheless, the high voltage output is decreasing when the radiation dose increases. This leads to remove \(\,4\,\)Volts at the upper limit of the range that becomes: \(HV_{in}-331\,\)Volts to \(HV_{in}-10\,\)Volts. The ranges of possible \(HV_{ces}\) values are shown in table 4.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|} \hline \(HV_{in}\) & \(HV_{1}\) & \(HV_{2}\) \\ \hline \(HV_{ces}\) (Volt) & [499,820] & [619,940] \\ \hline \end{tabular}

\end{table}
Table 3: values of high voltage source.

### Optical fluctuations

Cell to cell optical fluctuations due to tiles, fibres and couplings are corrected using a _Cesium_ source and equalising the response of each photomultiplier [3]. This is done tuning their gains by changing the corresponding high voltages. The nominal high voltage (\(HV_{nom}\)) measured in test benches and corresponding to a gain of \(10^{5}\) is so smeared. Previous test beams show that \(|HV_{ces}-HV_{nom}|\) < 50 Volts at 99% confidence level. The range of allowed \(HV_{nom}\) is so reduced of 50Volts at both sides with respect to the \(HV_{ces}\) one (see table 5).

### Optics ageing

During LHC operating, the optics used in the calorimeter, tiles and fibres, will loose part of their efficiencies because of natural ageing and of radiation. The induced lost of light, for example around 15% for tiles of first sampling after 10 years [3], will be corrected by increasing the gain of the photomultipliers. For this reason, it should be possible to increase the gain by a factor 2 in the high radiation region: cells of first sampling or adjoining the gap. A factor of only 1.5 would be sufficient for the cells in the low radiation region. Of course, gap and crack scintillators will be exposed to higher radiation levels but they are foreseen to be changed before having lost half of their efficiencies. Table 6 gives the number of photomultipliers for each range of amplification and for each type of super-drawers.

This leads to reduce the ranges of allowed nominal high voltage. The new ranges are defined here using the measurements of 500 photomultipliers performed in test bench where the amplification curves are fitted by \(G=\alpha\cdot V^{\beta}\). Knowing \(HV_{nom}\) and \(\beta\) for a photomultiplier, it is so possible to get the high voltage corresponding to a desired gain. Figure 2 shows the high voltage corresponding to an amplification of 1.5\(\times 10^{5}\) as a function of \(HV_{nom}\), each point corresponding to a photomultiplier. Figures 3, 4, 5 and 6 are the same but for amplifications of 2\(\times 10^{5}\), 3\(\times 10^{5}\), 4\(\times 10^{5}\) and 6\(\times 10^{5}\) respectively. Measurements are fitted with linear functions as shown on figures. Measured 99% confidence level intervals between fits and measurement values are also reported. In table 7, the allowed ranges of \(HV_{nom}\) are calculated for each amplification and for the two different \(HV_{in}\). To do this, the \(HV\) ranges are first reduced with respect to the 99% confidence level intervals defined above. The linear fits are then used. It should be noted that there is no _Cesium_ inter-calibration for crack scintillators and so no induced smearing. For gap scintillators, the high voltage smearing due to the _Cesium_ inter-calibration is assumed to be the same as in the rest of the calorimeter. Table 8 shows the ranges of \(HV_{nom}\) obtained from table 7 for the different ranges of amplification.

## 3 Others constraints

### Photomultiplier blocks

It is assumed here that, except the photomultiplier itself, all the other components of the blocks are equivalents. For this reason, the definition of sets of fully assembled photomultiplier blocks is equivalent to the one of photomultipliers.

### Other photomultiplier characteristics

All the others characteristics of the photomultipliers such as quantum efficiency, dark current, drift or linearity do not play a crucial role on the definition of sets of photomultipliers. If a photomultiplier is not good enough with respect to quantum efficiency, dark current, or drift, it is rejected during the quality control procedure. The mean dark current at 800V has to be lower than 250pA, which is completely negligible comparing with the noise of the downstream electronic. Each photomultiplier must have quantum efficiency greater than 14%, which is sufficient for muon identification [3]. The maximum allowed drift is 2%. In addition, the linearity of the photomultipliers are very good due to the optimisation work that have been done on the number of stages of amplification and on the repartition of tensions between dynodes: non-linearity smaller than 2% up to 50mA. For all these reasons, the study was limited to the photomultiplier high voltage.

### Drawer assembly

In order to do not complicate too much the drawer assembly, it is foreseen here to have only one type of feeling for each drawer type. Due to that, the same \(HV_{in}\) value should be taken for all super-drawers of the long barrel, and for all super-drawers of the extended barrels. As there is no special filling for special modules of section 1.2, the photomultipliers corresponding to cell C10 should be convenient for plugs and for scintillators: the range of amplification needed is so \(10^{5}\) to \(4\times 10^{5}\).

## 4 Definition of sets of photomultipliers

### Nominal high voltage distribution

As already seen, the definition of sets of photomultipliers will be only based on their nominal high voltages \(HV_{nom}\) measured in dedicated test benches and corresponding to a gain of \(10^{5}\). The quality control rejects photomultipliers with \(HV_{nom}\) lower than \(600\,\mathrm{Volts}\) or greater than \(800\,\mathrm{Volts}\). The distribution of \(HV_{nom}\) obtained for the first 500 photomultipliers is shown in figure 7. It will be the basis of all the following analysis.

### Choice of the high voltage source

With respect to section 3.3, there are two different possibilities: a) \(HV_{in}\)=\(HV_{I}\) for the long barrel super-drawers and \(HV_{in}\)=\(HV_{2}\) for the extended barrel super-drawers or b) \(HV_{in}\)=\(HV_{2}\) for the long barrel super-drawers and \(HV_{in}\)=\(HV_{I}\) for the extended barrel super-drawers. Looking at the constraints defined previously, two different types of cells appear for the long barrel super-drawers corresponding to low and high radiation regions. For the extended barrel superdrawers, three different types have to be considered: low and high radiation regions, and one for cells C10, E1, E2, E3, and E4. It is not foreseen here to have more than one special set for these cells. The proportions of photomultipliers needed for the different types of cells are reported in table 9. Table 10 shows the corresponding ranges of allowed \(HV_{nom}\) for the two different \(HV_{in}\). The proportions of photomultipliers observed in these ranges are shown in table 11. It appears that solution a) fulfils all the requirements of table 9. For solution b), the proportion of photomultipliers in the range corresponding to cells C10 and E1 to E4 is only (5.8\(\pm\)1.0)%, smaller than the 7.8% needed. The proportion of photomultipliers in the range corresponding to long barrel cells is (58.4\(\pm\)2.2)%, equal to the necessary value. This is not safe because it could be smaller on the total amount of photomultipliers. For these reasons, the solution a) is chosen.

Figure 7: distribution of \(HV_{nom}\) for the first 500 photomultipliers.

### Sets definition

The tables of previous section show that it is possible to merge low radiation cell type and high radiation one in only one set of photomultipliers. For long barrel, the proportion of photomultipliers observed in the range of \(HV_{nom}\) corresponding to high radiation cells is (65.1\(\pm\) 2.1)%, bigger than the 58.4% of the all long barrel. For extended barrels, the upper limit of the range of \(HV_{nom}\) corresponding to high radiation cells is 800Volts. The same limit in used in the quality control process. This leads to define only three sets of photomultipliers: one for long barrel super-drawers, and two for extended barrel super-drawers from which one is for photomultipliers associated to cells C10 and E1 to E4. By the way, it should be noted that, as the sets definition does not depend on the level of radiation in the corresponding cell, and with respect to optics ageing, it will be possible to increase the gain of all the photomultipliers by a factor 2. Table 12 shows the summary of the sets definition that leads to use two cuts on \(HV_{nom}\): \(X_{cut}\) and \(Y_{cut}\). They are calculated as the values for which 58.4% of photomultipliers \(HV_{nom}\) are lower than \(X_{cut}\) and 7.8% of photomultipliers \(HV_{nom}\) are between \(X_{cut}\) and \(Y_{cut}\). The only constraints that have to be taken into account are: 669 \(\leq\) \(X_{cut}\) (Volt) \(\leq\) 693 and 669 \(\leq\) \(Y_{cut}\) (Volt) \(\leq\) 716. From the measurements done on the first 500 photomultipliers, the following values have been obtained: \(X_{cut}\) = (685 \(\pm\) 2) Volts and \(Y_{cut}\) = (696 \(\pm\) \({}^{2}_{4}\))Volts. The constraints are so very safely fulfilled. Of course, the values of \(X_{cut}\) and \(Y_{cut}\) will have to be calculated for each batch of photomultipliers before drawer assembly in order to divide the batch in sets. They will also have to be compared with the previous constraints to check if the analysis reported here is still convenient. Nevertheless, if the Hamamatsu production is stable in time, as it should be, this will not be a problem as \(X_{cut}\) and \(Y_{cut}\) values should not change a lot.

## 5 Conclusion and outlook

The sets of photomultiplier blocks have been defined using only the nominal high voltages of the photomultipliers measured in dedicated test benches. Using \(HV_{in}\)=\(HV_{I}\)(=-830Volts) for the long barrel super-drawers and \(HV_{in}\)=\(HV_{2}\)(=-950Volts) for the extended barrel super-drawers, three sets have been defined: one for long barrel, and two for extended barrels. In such a way, it will be possible to correct optics ageing (natural and radiation induced) increasing the amplification up to a factor 2 for all the photomultipliers. In addition, the convenience of this analysis could be easily checked for each batch of photomultipliers calculating the two used cuts on \(HV_{nom}\), \(X_{cut}\) and \(Y_{cut}\), and verifying the relations: \(669\!\leq\!X_{cut}\,(\mbox{Volt})\!\leq\!693\) and \(669\!\leq\!Y_{cut}\,(\mbox{Volt})\!\leq\!716\). Done on the first 500 photomultipliers (batches 1 and 2), this little exercise has been redone on the 750 photomultipliers of the third batch. The results are: \(X_{cut}\!=\!\left(682\!\pm_{2}^{3}\right)\)Volts and \(Y_{cut}\!=\!\left(689\!\pm\!1\right)\)Volts. For the all three batches, the cut values are: \(X_{cut}\!=\!\left(684\!\pm_{2}^{1}\right)\)Volts and \(Y_{cut}\!=\!\left(690\!\pm_{1}^{2}\right)\)Volts. The filling of the four different types of drawers with the three sets of photomultiplier blocks is given in table 13.
