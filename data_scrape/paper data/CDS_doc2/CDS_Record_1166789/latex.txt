###### Abstract

We present new methods for measuring the \(W\) mass at ATLAS, and show their performance on simulated data. The experimental systematic uncertainties and their impact on the \(m_{W}\) measurement are evaluated, with samples downscaled to 15 pb\({}^{-1}\). The electron transverse momentum analysis yields a precision of \(\delta m_{W}=120\,(stat)\oplus 117\,(syst)\,\) MeV. The systematic uncertainty is dominated by the energy scale. In the muon channel, the transverse mass analysis gives \(\delta m_{W}=57\,(stat)\oplus 231\,(syst)\,\) MeV, where the dominant contribution comes from the recoil calibration. PDF uncertainties contributes \(\delta m_{W}=25\) MeV. Other theoretical uncertainties were not explicitely considered, but expected to be small in comparison to experimental uncertainties in early \(m_{W}\) measurements.

Introduction to the \(W\) mass measurement at the LHC

The mass of the \(W\) boson is currently measured to be \(m_{W}=80.399\pm 0.025\) GeV [1]. Since the \(W\) boson mass and the top quark mass are the largest sources of uncertainty in the indirect determination of the Higgs boson mass, improved precision is desirable. The expected total inclusive \(W\) cross section at the LHC is about 20.5 nb for each lepton channel [2]. In 10 fb\({}^{-1}\) of data, around \(30\times 10^{6}\)\(W\) events will be selected in each leptonic decay channel (\(W\to e\nu,\mu\nu\)), providing a combined statistical sensitivity of about 2 MeV. Systematic errors will need to be controlled to comparable precision.

The present note is however concerned with the early ATLAS data (\(\mathcal{L}\sim 10-20\) pb\({}^{-1}\)), with an expected statistical precision of about 100 MeV. In this context, the main sources of systematic uncertainty are of experimental origin (energy and momentum scales, resolution, efficiency). Other sources, related to the theoretical description of \(W\) production, play a less significant role.

The aim of the following is to establish an unbiased \(W\) mass fit with templates, demonstrate that using \(Z\) events for calibration is valid, and show that the experimental sources of systematic uncertainties can be controlled to the level of the statistical sensitivity. In doing so, we test the readiness for the \(W\) mass measurement in the first years of data taking.

This note is structured as follows. First a general discussion in Section 2 gives the outline of the analysis, the ingredients involved in a \(W\) mass measurement, and the challenges in controlling them. Template based \(W\) mass fits are presented in Sections 3 to 5, exploiting the electron and muon channels. In a first step, all ingredients entering the templates are supposed perfectly known. We then evaluate the dependence of the fit results on each of them. Section 6 describes the calibration of the absolute lepton energy scale and resolution using \(Z\) decays. This section also discusses the effect of the lepton reconstruction efficiencies. Background uncertainties are treated in Section 7. Section 8 quantifies residual systematic uncertainties after _in situ_ calibration. Finally, Section 9 summarizes the analysis and concludes.

## 2 Outline and strategy of the analysis

### Simulation and data sets

The simulated \(W\) and \(Z\) samples on which this note is based are generated using the pythia event generator [3]. Photon radiation is carried out by photos[4], and \(\tau\) decays are handled by tauola[5]. Detector simulation is done using geant4 version 4.0[6], and reconstruction with Athena version 12.0.6. These fully simulated events are reconstructed using the ATLAS software, and used as real data ("pseudo-data"). For the production of templates, we use the generator-level information only, together with estimated detector smearing corrections. Simulated statistics of our main signal samples are shown in Table 1. Our \(W\) signal samples correspond to roughly 15 pb\({}^{-1}\). In the following, all results will be normalized to this luminosity, i.e. downscaling results from the larger \(Z\) samples.

### Event selection

Since the dijet cross section at hadron colliders is several orders of magnitude larger than the \(W\) boson cross section, the hadronic decay modes of \(W\) and \(Z\) bosons are not usable. Therefore, only the leptonic decay modes \(W\to\ell\nu\) and \(Z\to\ell\ell\) (\(\ell=e,\mu\)) are considered. While the \(W\) and \(Z\) bosons are produced with a small transverse momentum on average (see Figure 2(a)), their longitudinal boost can be large. However, this boost leaves the lepton transverse momenta unchanged, which subsequently is a good distribution to study \(W\) boson decays.

\(W\) events are required to have one isolated lepton with \(p_{T}\) above 20 GeV and missing transverse energy (\(\not{E}_{T}\)) in excess of 20 GeV. \(Z\) events are required to have two isolated leptons with \(p_{T}\) above 20 GeV of opposite charge (see Figure 1). The triggers providing these events are an isolated 15 GeV electron trigger and a 20 GeV muon trigger. The electrons are required to pass tight identification criterion [7], and only combined muons (with reconstructed tracks in both the inner detector and the muon spectrometer [8]) are used. Both electrons and muons are required to lie within the tracking range \(|\eta|<2.5\) (see Figure 2(b)). In addition, the calorimeter barrel-endcap transition range \(1.3<|\eta|<1.6\) is excluded for electrons.

In addition to this basic selection, some other requirements apply. To reject backgrounds from jet and \(t\bar{t}\) events, the signal events are required not to have large hadronic transverse activity. A summary of the requirements can be found in Table 2.

The expected numbers of events in 15 pb\({}^{-1}\) from the above mentioned event selection are summarized in Table 3. Though the expected number of reconstructed \(Z\) events is an order of magnitude smaller than that of \(W\) events, the fact that \(Z\) events are fully reconstructed and thus have much better mass resolution compensates for this deficit.

The combined transverse momentum of the recoil \(u\), which should match that of the boson, is used to estimate the momentum of the undetected neutrino in the \(W\to\ell\nu\) decay. The dotted ellipses represent the uncertainties.

(b) Distribution in \(\eta\) of reconstructed muons from \(W\) and \(Z\) events.

### Input to \(W\) mass fit

While the \(Z\) decay can be fully reconstructed, and its mass calculated from the invariant mass of the decay leptons, this is not the case for \(W\) decays, where the neutrino goes undetected. From the momentum imbalance one can infer the missing energy, but with limited precision and only in the transverse direction. This means that the invariant mass can not be determined, and one is forced to consider other variables sensitive to the \(W\) mass. In principle there are three sensitive variables:

\(\bullet\) The lepton transverse momentum, \(p_{T}^{\ell}\).

\(\bullet\) The missing transverse momentum, \(p_{T}^{\nu}\equiv\not{E}_{T}\).

\(\bullet\) The \(W\) transverse mass, defined as: \(m_{T}^{W}\equiv\sqrt{2p_{T}^{\ell}p_{T}^{\nu}(1-\cos(\phi^{\ell}-\phi^{\nu}))}\).

The lepton transverse momentum is measured with an accuracy of about 2% for electrons and muons [7, 8] in the momentum range of interest (see Section 6.2). This is an order of magnitude better compared to the accuracy of the missing transverse energy determination, which has a resolution of about 20-30% [9]. Finally, the \(W\) transverse mass combines the two momenta along with the azimuthal angle between them.

All of the above distributions have a Jacobian peak either at \(m_{W}/2\) (\(p_{T}^{\ell}\) and \(p_{T}^{\nu}\)) or \(m_{W}\) (\(m_{T}^{W}\)), which is sensitive to the \(W\) mass. The sharpness of the peak is affected both by the resolution and the boson \(p_{T}\). While the lepton \(p_{T}\) has a very good resolution, the \(p_{T}\) of the boson smears this Jacobian edge. On the contrary, \(m_{T}^{W}\) is to first order insensitive to the \(p_{T}\) of the boson, but here the edge is smeared by the poor resolution of the missing transverse energy (see Figure 3). Finally, \(p_{T}^{\nu}\) suffers from both effects, and is therefore the poorest candidate for a fitting variable. Since \(m_{T}^{W}\) is formed from \(p_{T}^{\ell}\) and \(p_{T}^{\nu}\), it is of course statistically correlated with \(p_{T}^{\ell}\). However, the statistical correlation between \(m_{T}^{W}\) and \(p_{T}^{\ell}\) is only about 30%, and since they have different systematic errors, combining the measurements based on these observables could improve the sensitivity.

### Fitting the \(W\) mass with templates

The lepton transverse momentum and \(W\) transverse mass distributions, \(p_{T}^{\ell}\) and \(m_{T}^{W}\), shown in Figure 3, are the result of several non trivial effects. For this reason no analytical expression describes the distributions in detail, and one is forced to use numerical methods. One method for fitting these distributions is template fitting [10, 11]. Templates of the \(p_{T}^{\ell}\) and \(m_{T}^{W}\) distributions are produced with

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{l r r r r} \hline \hline Channel & \(W\to e\nu\) & \(W\rightarrow\mu\nu\) & \(Z\to ee\) & \(Z\rightarrow\mu\mu\) \\ \hline Detector acceptance [\%] & 44.3 & 45.4 & 42.4 & 39.9 \\ Reconstruction efficiency [\%] & 21.7 & 39.1 & 10.4 & 33.4 \\ Nb. of events for 15 \(\,\mathrm{pb}^{-1}\) [\(10^{3}\) events] & 66.7 & 120.2 & 3.2 & 10.1 \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 3: Acceptances, total reconstruction efficiencies, and resulting statistics for 15 \(\,\mathrm{pb}^{-1}\) of data. The \(W\) cross sections are inclusive, while the \(Z\) cross sections are for invariant masses above 60 \(\,\mathrm{GeV}\). Both are at NNLO and contain the relevant branching fractions. The acceptance is the fraction of events which lies within the detector acceptance, while the total reconstruction efficiency is the overall efficiency for an event to pass all selection criteria including the acceptance.

varying \(m_{W}\) values, and compared to the corresponding distribution observed in data (see Figure 6). The comparison is based on a binned \(\chi^{2}\) method.

To estimate the impact of a given effect on the \(W\) mass determination, templates unaware of the effect under consideration are produced and subsequently fitted to data, which includes this effect. Assuming an unbiased fit, when the effect is not included in the data (see Sections 3 and 4), the resulting shift in fit value measures the systematic error on the \(W\) mass from not including the effect. By gradually changing the size of an effect, the systematic error on the \(W\) mass as a function of this effect can be determined. As most effects are small, the dependencies are approximately linear. They are in general different for the \(p_{T}^{\ell}\) and \(m_{T}^{W}\) fits. If an effect can be characterized by one parameter \(a\), the systematic errors (\(\delta m_{W}\)) can be calculated from the derivative \(\partial m_{W}/\partial a\) times the size of the uncertainty \(\delta a\). If more parameters are required, the systematic uncertainty is calculated from all parameters \(a_{i}\) and their covariances \(\text{Cov}_{i,j}\).

\[\delta m_{W}\ =\ \frac{\partial m_{W}}{\partial a}\delta a\quad(\text{ Single parameter})\qquad\qquad\delta m_{W}^{2}\ =\ \sum_{i,j}\frac{\partial m_{W}}{\partial a_{i}}\frac{\partial m_{W}}{ \partial a_{j}}\text{Cov}_{i,j}\quad(\text{Multi parameter})\]

In the following, the \(\delta a\) are to be understood as relative uncertainties, and the derivatives are with respect to these relative uncertainties. Our results for \(\partial m_{W}/\partial a\) are normalized in MeV/%.

### Calibration procedure

The calibration of the absolute energy/momentum2 lepton scale plays a central role, as it is the largest systematic uncertainty and the starting point of all other calibrations.

Figure 3: Fitted distributions of \(p_{T}^{\ell}\) (a) and \(m_{T}^{W}\) (b), showing the Jacobian peak, and the effects of finite detector resolution (i.e. smearing) and recoil (i.e. \(p_{T}\) of the \(W\)). While \(p_{T}^{\ell}\) is more sensitive to the recoil than to the resolution, the converse is true for the \(m_{T}^{W}\) distribution.

#### 2.5.1 Average calibration

To first order, a single average lepton scale factor, defined as \(\alpha_{E}=E_{\rm rec}/E_{\rm true}\), independently of \(\eta\) and \(p_{T}\), can be obtained by demanding that the reconstructed \(Z\) peak matches its known mass. While this assures the correct lepton scale and resolution for \(Z\) events, the energy scale obtained in this way might not apply to \(W\) events. Because of non linearities and non uniformities, the different \(p_{T}\) and \(\eta\) distributions in \(W\) and \(Z\) events can possibly introduce significant bias.

#### 2.5.2 Differential calibration

If needed, an upgrade to a differential calibration can be performed, which contrary to the average calibration includes variations of scale and resolution with energy/momentum, \(\eta\), and/or \(\phi\). The three key ingredients to such a calibration are the precise knowledge of the \(Z\) mass, width, and decay kinematics, the non zero transverse momentum of the \(Z\) bosons, and the very large sample of \(Z\) bosons produced at the LHC.

The calibration uses a large sample of reconstructed \(Z\to\ell\ell\) events along with corresponding templates, representing our knowledge of the \(Z\) lineshape, which we assume known. Through a comparison of the two in bins of the variables of interest (lepton \(p_{T}\), \(\eta\), and \(\phi\)) one can extract the scale and resolution in each of these bins [12].

Once the absolute scale is set for the leptons, the hadronic recoil scale can be determined by comparing it to the transverse momentum of the leptons from the \(Z\). Again, this calibration can be done differentially, measuring the missing momentum response as a function of \(p_{T}(Z)\), the recoil size, and the hadronic transverse activity (\(\sum E_{T}^{\rm hadrons}\)). While this calibration is naturally not as accurate as that of the lepton scale, due to the poorer resolution of the hadronic recoil, it fortunately turns out that the mass fit is less sensitive to the recoil scale (see Section 4.3).

#### 2.5.3 Efficiency determination

The efficiency is determined using the "tag and probe" methods [13], again applied to \(Z\to\ell\ell\) events. The different spectra in \(W\) and \(Z\) events is accounted for by determining the efficiency as a function of \(p_{T}\) and \(\eta\), which has been found to yield efficiencies compatible between \(W\) and \(Z\)[7, 8].

The following sections attempts to quantify the above outline.

## 3 Fitting the \(W\) mass with templates - electron channel

### Modelling templates for \(W\) mass fit

As no analytical expression matches the lepton transverse momentum and \(W\) transverse mass distributions \(p_{T}^{\ell}\) and \(m_{T}^{W}\), we fit the \(W\) mass using the template method (see Section 2.4). For the templates of varying \(W\) mass to match the measured distribution well, all effects influencing these distributions must be included when producing the templates. The principle influences are scale, resolution, non gaussian tails, efficiency and background effects, which are (with the exception of background) primarily obtained from the similar but more constrained \(Z\to\ell\ell\) events, as discussed in Section 6.

Two assumptions have to be validated first, namely the lack of bias of the fit in itself, and the portability of the calibration from the \(Z\) to the \(W\). The lack of bias is tested by assuming perfectly known physics and detector response. In practice, the detector response is determined at this stage from direct comparisons of the lepton reconstruction to the generator level kinematics, using the \(W\) sample that is used in the mass fits. Then the fit is repeated using templates with the detector response estimated from the \(Z\) sample, still comparing reconstructed to simulated kinematics. An unbiased result validates the portability, i.e. that detector parameters can indeed be ported from \(Z\) to \(W\) events, justifying an _in situ_ determination of these parameters using \(Z\) events.

In addition it has to be tested that the template components can be included without biasing the fit, and thus that a subsequent calibration, which matches the truth, will yield unbiased templates. This is tested in the following. The statistical sensitivity of our \(W\to e\nu\) sample, corresponding to 15 pb\({}^{-1}\) of data, is about 120 MeV, and we provide an estimate of the required precision on the detector response parameters to keep the systematic uncertainty within this limit.

### Fits to \(m_{W}\) using templates: Validation of the method

In this section, the detector parameters are determined from fits to \(E_{\rm rec}/E_{\rm true}\), the ratio of reconstructed to true energy of the decay electrons. The fits are done using the so-called "Crystal Ball" PDF [14], which aims at describing the result of calorimetric resolution together with upstream energy loss in a single function. It has four parameters and displays a gaussian core, and a power-law tail at low energy. Its expression is, up to normalization factors:

\[CB(x) = \left\{\begin{array}{ll}e^{-(\frac{x-\alpha_{E}}{\alpha_{E}}) ^{2}},&x>\alpha_{E}-n\sigma_{E}\\ (\beta/n-|n|-x)^{-\beta},&x<\alpha_{E}-n\sigma_{E}\end{array}\right. \tag{1}\]

where \(x=E_{\rm rec}/E_{\rm true}\), \(\alpha_{E}\) is the position of the peak, \(\sigma_{E}\) the gaussian width; \(n\) gives, in units of \(\sigma_{E}\), the point of transition between the gaussian and power-law descriptions, and \(\beta\) is the exponent controlling the tails. The relative normalization of the two components preserves continuity at \(\alpha_{E}-n\sigma_{E}\), up to the first derivative. While not fully satisfactory from a theoretical point of view (the combination of resolution effects and radiation should in principle be given by a proper convolution), it is very effective in describing the observed response.

The fits are performed vs. \(\eta\) and \(p_{T}\). The angular range \(0<|\eta|<2.5\) is divided in intervals of size \(\Delta\eta=0.1\). In each interval, fits are done for \(10<p_{T}<70\) GeV, in intervals \(\Delta p_{T}=10\) GeV. Figure 4 shows a number of examples, at different values of \(\eta\) and \(p_{T}\). The \(\eta\) dependence of the parameters, for \(30<p_{T}<40\) GeV, are displayed in Figure 5, where the shaded regions correspond to the excluded \(|\eta|\) region described in Section 2.2.

In our fits the \(\beta\) parameter was constrained to the range \(0<\beta<5\). As the examples in Figure 4 illustrate, the \(\beta\) parameter appears to systematically choose values close to its upper bound, while satisfactory fits are still obtained. Therefore, we fix \(\beta=5\) in the remaining of the analysis, and treat the response functions in terms of \(\alpha_{E}\), \(\sigma_{E}\) and \(n\) only. The \(p_{T}\) spectrum templates are produced from generator level \(W\to e\nu\) events, where the electrons are smeared using the above function and parameters according to their kinematic variables. Three example template distributions are shown in Figure 6(a), corresponding to three values of \(m_{W}\). The number of events used to produce the templates is increased by repeatedly smearing generator level particles. Although this limits the impact of statistical fluctuations in the templates on the result, template fluctuations are still visible.

are plotted on a wide range to assure that the entire \(p_{T}\) spectrum is under control. The fitting range is chosen to be between 30 and 60 GeV to avoid edge effects and to reject backgrounds (see Section 7).

The mass fit is performed using binned \(\chi^{2}\) comparisons between the pseudo-data and the template histograms. Given that all \(p_{T}\) bins contain at least several hundred events, the \(\chi^{2}\) of a given comparison can be defined as:

\[\chi^{2}=\sum_{i=1}^{N}\frac{(n_{i,data}-n_{i,template})^{2}}{\sigma_{i,data}^{ 2}+\sigma_{i,template}^{2}}, \tag{2}\]

where the sum is over the histogram bins, and \(n\) and \(\sigma\) are the bin contents and their errors, respectively. Computed as a function of \(\alpha_{m}=m_{W}/m_{W}^{true}\), the \(\chi^{2}\) follows the parabola illustrated in Figure 7, which can be used to determine the \(m_{W}^{fit}\) and its error. The obtained parabola is satisfactory despite the fluctuations of the \(\chi^{2}\) points with respect to the fitted curve, which are due to the finite statistics of the templates. We obtain \(m_{W}^{fit}=80.468\pm 0.117\) GeV, to be compared to the input value \(m_{W}^{true}=80.405\) GeV. The best fit template is shown in Figure 6(b). The stability of this result is verified by repeating this exercise a number of times, with the detector smearing applied independently in each exercise (i.e, producing independent sets of templates). The distribution of \(m_{W}^{fit}\) has a spread well compatible with the estimated fit uncertainty.

We thus conclude that within the statistical sensitivity of the \(W\to e\nu\) sample, the current procedure provides an unbiased estimate of \(m_{W}\). We now proceed to relax our main assumptions and quantify the dependence of the fit on the detector response parameters.

### Sensitivity of \(m_{W}^{fit}\) to the template components

This section quantifies the stability of \(m_{W}^{fit}\) under variations of the assumptions used to produce the templates. As stated earlier, we leave phenomenological considerations aside and concentrate on experimental effects. We study explicitly the effect of non gaussian tails in the detector response function, reconstruction and identification efficiency, and backgrounds. The dependence of \(m_{W}^{fit}\) on the detector scale and resolution was studied in [15], and reviewed here. The bias

Figure 6: (a) Templates obtained at three example mass points, namely \(\alpha_{m}=m_{W}/m_{W}^{true}=0.98,1,1.02\). (b) Best fit template (histogram), compared to the pseudo-data (points).

as a function of the fractional error on the lepton scale (\(\alpha_{E}\)) and resolution (\(\sigma_{E}\)) is found to be:

\[\partial m_{W}/\partial\alpha_{E}=800\ \mathrm{MeV}/\%\,,\ \ \ \partial m_{W}/\partial\sigma_{E}=0.8\ \mathrm{MeV}/\%\,. \tag{3}\]

The impact of non gaussian tails is studied as follows. Starting from the detector response parametrization described in Section 3.2, we suppress the tails of the distribution and assume a pure gaussian response. The parameters describing scale and resolution are kept to their previous value. We then produce templates and perform the fit as above. The procedure is illustrated in Figure 8. The response distribution can be compared to Figure 4 to assess the impact of neglecting the non gaussian part of the distribution. As can be seen, the corresponding templates are biased towards higher \(p_{T}\); we thus anticipate, as otherwise expected, that an underestimation of the tails should imply a negative \(\delta m_{W}\).

We obtain a bias \(\delta m_{W}=-555\) MeV, corresponding to an underestimation of the non gaussian tails by 100%. Denoting \(\tau\) the non gaussian fraction of the response function, we thus estimate the bias as

Figure 8: (a) Response function at \(0.2<\eta<0.3\), \(20<p_{T}<30\) GeV, removing the non gaussian part of the distribution. (b) Pseudo-data (points), compared to templates produced assuming \(m_{W}=m_{W}^{true}\), with non gaussian tails included (full line) or not (dashed line).

a function of the relative error on the tails as:

\[\partial m_{W}/\partial\tau=-5.5\ \mathrm{MeV}/\%\,. \tag{4}\]

Distortions in the \(p_{T}\) distribution can also be caused by the lepton reconstruction efficiency, as soon at it has a non trivial \(p_{T}\) dependence, i.e. \(\varepsilon_{\ell}=\varepsilon_{\ell}(p_{T})\). This is the case in the electron channel, as illustrated in Figure 9.

As above, we quantify the impact of this \(p_{T}\) dependence by taking the pseudo-data as they are, but assuming a flat efficiency in the templates. Since \(\varepsilon_{\ell}(p_{T})\) is an increasing function of \(p_{T}\), we expect that the templates will be biased towards lower \(p_{T}\) values, inducing a positive shift in \(m_{W}^{fit}\). Performing the mass fit indeed yields \(\delta m_{W}=360\) MeV (this bias corresponds to a perfectly flat efficiency assumption). We estimate the bias per percent relative error on the \(p_{T}\) dependence of \(\varepsilon_{\ell}\) to be:

\[\partial m_{W}/\partial\varepsilon_{\ell}=3.6\ \mathrm{MeV}/\%\,. \tag{5}\]

Note that the present analysis only relies on the \(p_{T}\) dependence of \(\varepsilon_{\ell}\) and not on its absolute value.

### Comparison of \(W\) and \(Z\) events

Before explicitly calibrating detector parameters from \(Z\) events and applying them in the \(m_{W}\) fit, we verify that this procedure is indeed justified. To this end, we perform the detector response fits as described in Section 3.2 on our \(Z\to ee\) sample, obtaining a map of the response parameters \(\alpha_{E}\), \(\sigma_{E}\) and \(n\) as a function of \(\eta\) and \(p_{T}\) of the electrons.

A first check is to compare the obtained values to those extracted from the \(W\) sample. This is illustrated in Figure 10. For all parameters, agreement is found within the statistical sensitivity throughout the analysed electron phase space, except for the resolution parameter in the shaded \(\eta\) region, excluded in the study as explained in Section 2.2. We thus expect that templates produced using detector response to \(Z\) events will provide an adequate description of \(W\) events.

A \(m_{W}\) fit is performed next. Templates are produced from generator level \(W\to e\nu\) events, smeared according to detector performance found on \(Z\) events. The resulting distributions are shown in Figure 11(a) together with their ratio in Figure 11(b); good agreement is observed. Fitted with a straight

line, Figure 11(b) shows a slope of \((3\pm 2)\)\(10^{-4}\), compatible with 0, but which yields a small bias towards higher masses. Accordingly, the result of the fit is \(m_{W}^{fit}=80.567\pm 0.118\) GeV, to be compared to \(m_{W}^{fit}=80.468\pm 0.117\) GeV obtained with detector performance found on \(W\) events. The result is compatible with the input value \(m_{W}^{true}=80.405\) GeV.

## 4 Fitting the \(W\) mass with templates - muon channel

This section repeats the discussion of Section 3 for the muons channel. In addition, a template fit of the \(m_{T}^{W}\) distribution is described.

Figure 11: (a) Templates obtained for \(\alpha_{m}=m_{W}/m_{W}^{true}=1\), with detector performance obtained from \(W\) events (full line) and from \(Z\) events (dashes). (b) Ratio of the previous histograms, fitted with a straight line.

### Template fits to the muon transverse momentum

Repeating the analysis from Section 3 for the muon channel yields \(m_{W}^{fit}=80.538\pm 0.106\) GeV, obtained with detector performance found on \(W\) events, and \(m_{W}^{fit}=80.508\pm 0.106\) GeV, with detector performance found on \(Z\) events. The differences with the electron channel are described in the following.

The dependence of the template fit on the scale and resolution is the same in the muon channel as in the electron channel. The muon momentum resolution is generally slightly worse, and whereas the electron resolution improves with \(p_{T}\), the converse is true for the muon resolution. Figure 12 shows four examples of the momentum ratio distributions \(p_{T}^{\rm rec}/p_{T}^{\rm true}\) for muons - two from \(W\) events and two from \(Z\) events. As can be seen, the shapes can be modeled well with a core gaussian distribution describing the general muon bias and resolution complemented by an outlier gaussian distribution accounting for the muons, which are encountering parts of the detector with poor muon spectrometer coverage and increased material, resulting in a slightly degraded resolution.

To check the portability, the fitted constants are again compared between the \(W\) and the \(Z\) events, as can be seen in Figure 13. The correspondance between the fitted parameters is satisfactory. According to Figures 13(b) and 13(d), the resolution parameters are systematically smaller in \(W\) events. The difference between the resolutions in \(W\) and \(Z\) events averaged over \(\eta\) is 3.6%, which combined to Eq. 3

Figure 12: Distributions of transverse momentum ratios \(p_{T}^{\rm rec}/p_{T}^{\rm true}\) for muons from \(W\) ((a) and (c)) and \(Z\) ((b) and (d)) decays at \(|\eta|<0.36\) ((a) and (b)) and \(1.79<|\eta|<2.14\) ((c) and (d)) in the momentum range 35-40 GeV.

leads to a bias of 3 MeV. As will be seen in Section 6, this bias can be neglected given the precision of the _in situ_ scale and resolution determination.

Unlike the electron case, the muon reconstruction efficiency does not vary significanly over the momentum range of interest. As can be seen from Figure 14, the efficiency is quite constant above 10 GeV, varying only slightly between barrel (\(\epsilon=95.8\%\)) and endcap (\(\epsilon=94.3\%\)) region, due to increase in material. As the reconstructed muons are required to have a momentum above 20 GeV, the efficiency is essentially constant.

The flatness of the efficiency is not expected to change until at several hundred GeV, where radiative losses grow larger than those due to ionization [1]. Using the "tag-and-probe" method, the hypothesis of a flat muon efficiency will be tested. The uncertainty in the linear fit translates for 15 \(\,\mathrm{pb}^{-1}\) into a systematic error of 16 MeV, which is much less than in the electron channel, as expected.

### Fitting the transverse \(W\) mass

Having tested the template fitting of the \(p_{T}^{\ell}\) distribution, we now move to the \(m_{T}^{W}\) distribution. In addition to the lepton residuals, this fit requires residuals for the missing momentum. Since the missing momentum is a transverse quantity, it does not depend on the \(\eta\) of the lepton(s) in the event. However,

Figure 13: Comparison of fitted mean (a), core resolution (b), outlier resolution (c), and outlier fraction (d) between \(W\) (circles) and \(Z\) (squares) events for muons in the momentum range \(30<p_{T}<35\) GeV in seven bins of \(|\eta|\). The markers have been artificially shifted, left (\(W\)) and right (\(Z\)), in \(|\eta|\) to increase readability.

the detector response depends on the total transverse hadronic activity \(\Sigma E_{T}\) and the recoil momentum perpendicular to the direction of the leptons (cf. Figure 1).

To describe the response, \(\Sigma E_{T}\) is divided in 10 bins in the range [0,200] \(\mathrm{GeV}\) and recoil momentum into 10 bins in the range [0,40] \(\mathrm{GeV}\), each with an additional overflow bin. In each bin, the distributions are well described by two gaussian distributions with a common mean, as the missing momentum residuals are not expected to have any asymmetric tails.

To study the response, it is useful to project the \(\not{E}_{T}\) momentum components onto two axes, defined event by event in the transverse plane. The parallel axis is defined such that the azimuthal angles between the leptons (\(\ell\) and \(\nu\)) and this axis are minimized and equal, and the perpendicular axis is defined as perpendicular to the parallel axis. This reference system adapts better to the individual event topology than fixed axes. Examples of the residual distributions projected on these axes are shown in Figure 15.

Using the above modelling of the missing momentum response, we produce \(m_{T}^{W}\) templates and test if the fit is unbiased or not. Unlike the lepton case, no additional efficiency curve has to be included, as the missing momentum is calculated for every event. As can be seen from Figure 16, the \(m_{T}^{W}\) templates match the reconstructed distribution, and the fit is unbiased, giving a fitted value of \(80.421\pm 0.059\)\(\mathrm{GeV}\) compared to an input value of \(80.405\)\(\mathrm{GeV}\).

### Fitting the transverse \(W\) mass using the \(Z\) events for calibration

The dependence of the \(m_{W}^{fit}\) on the relative recoil scale and resolution uncertainty was determined to be [15]:

\[\partial m_{W}/\partial\alpha_{recoil}=-200\ \mathrm{MeV}/\%\,,\ \ \partial m_{W}/\partial\sigma_{recoil}=-25\ \mathrm{MeV}/\%\,. \tag{6}\]

Insert shows a zoomed view on the range of interest along with a constant fit to each of the graphs. The hypothesis of a flat probability in the range 10-70 \(\mathrm{GeV}\) has been tested to be valid. (b) Muon efficiency ratio between \(W\) and \(Z\) events. No \(p_{T}\) dependence is seen, and a linear fit yields a slope of \((6.3\pm 6.5)\times 10^{-5}\), consistent with zero.

(b) \(\chi^{2}\) value of fitting templates to the reconstructed distribution as a function of the template’s (fraction of) \(W\) mass hypothesis (compared to the nominal mass). The fit yields \(80.421\pm 0.059\) GeV in agreement with the input value of 80.405 GeV.

Figure 15: Distribution of \(\not{E}_{T}\) residuals \(\not{E}_{T}^{\rm rec}-\not{E}_{T}^{\rm true}\) for \(W\) decays. The \(\not{E}_{T}\) momentum components along the parallel (a) and perpendicular (b) axes are shown, for a recoil momentum in the range [8,12] GeV, and \(\Sigma E_{T}\) in the range [20,30] GeV. The fitting function describes the distributions well.

These parameters can again be measured on \(Z\) events. To test the portability from the \(W\) to the \(Z\) of the \(m_{T}^{W}\) fit, we model the missing momentum using the \(Z\) events and compare this to the one obtained from the \(W\) events. However, unlike the lepton case, the detector response is not exactly the same for \(W\) and \(Z\) events. The difference is caused by the \(\not{E}_{T}\) reconstruction algorithm, which in its current state does not correctly subtract lepton calorimetric signals from the hadronic recoil. This results in a difference between \(W\) events where only one lepton is present, and \(Z\) events containing two leptons.

To illustrate this point, consider again the parallel and perpendicular axes defined in the previous section. The residuals of the recoil momentum components are projected on both axes, and the response in \(W\) and \(Z\) events is compared, cf. Figure 17. Along the parallel axis, the average difference between the residuals is \(\Delta_{W-Z}=17\pm 35\) MeV. Along the perpendicular axis, the difference is larger, \(\Delta_{W-Z}=1964\pm 35\) MeV. Using a Z-based calibration in the W mass fit is thus expected to be biased; performing this exercise indeed yields \(m_{W}^{fit}=79.752\pm 0.062\) GeV compared to the input value of 80.405 GeV. The Z based recoil calibration is thus not exploitable at present.

Instead, we assume that the needed improvements to the \(\not{E}_{T}\) reconstruction algorithm will be done in time for the measurement, providing equal response between \(W\) and \(Z\) events. The statistical sensitivity based on the Z-based calibration is about 50 MeV for 15 pb\({}^{-1}\), serving as a lower bound. Given the present uncertainties and the performance of similar analysis [16], we assume that the _in situ_ calibration can be performed with a precision of 1 % with an associated uncertainty \(\delta m_{W}=200\) MeV, according to Equation 6. The effect of pile-up on the missing momentum has not been studied.

## 5 Statistical uncertainty as a function of fitting range

As previously stated, the sensitivity to the \(W\) mass comes from the Jacobian edge in the fitting distribution. Generally the Jacobian edge is slightly sharper for the \(m_{T}^{W}\) distribution (see Figure 3), yielding a smaller statistical uncertainty. To test the influence of the fitting range, three different fitting ranges has been tested for the \(p_{T}^{\ell}\) and \(m_{T}^{W}\) distributions for the \(W\rightarrow\mu\nu\) sample. Since the typical \(m_{T}^{W}\) values are twice as large as the \(p_{T}^{\ell}\) values, the range size has been chosen accordingly. The result can be seen in Table 4.

As can be seen from Table 4, the \(p_{T}^{\ell}\) statistical uncertainty changes of about 30% with fitting range, while the \(m_{T}^{W}\) statistical uncertainty is essentially insensitive to the range, and generally somewhat lower as expected. Considering that most systematic effects (such as backgrounds, electron calibration and efficiency, etc.) are largest at low momenta, a loss in \(p_{T}^{\ell}\) statistical uncertainty will be countered by a gain in systematic uncertainty. For the \(m_{T}^{W}\) fit a narrow range is surely preferable. However, it is not possible to quantify this gain until all systematic uncertainties have been calculated.

## 6 Lepton performance determination _in situ_

In this section we review algorithms to calibrate the lepton response using \(Z\) events, and feed back the results to the \(m_{W}\) fit.

### Average scale and resolution

We first perform a global scale analysis, to verify whether neglecting possible non linearities in the response can be expected to induce a significant bias. We restrain ourselves to the electron channel. Fixing the non gaussian tail parameters to \(n=0.8\) and \(\beta=5\), as expected from the studies performed in Section 3.3, we produce templates of the \(Z\) resonance by varying the electron scale and resolution. These response parameters are applied to generator level electrons as before.

The templates are then fitted to the fully simulated \(Z\) peak. A very good fit is obtained, as shown in Figure 18. An average scaling factor of \(\alpha_{E}=0.9958\pm 0.0003\), and an average relative resolution of \(\sigma_{E}=0.0207\pm 0.0003\) provide a satisfactory description of the resonance. The precision of the fit corresponds to the complete \(Z\) event sample, i.e. \(\mathcal{L}=200\) pb\({}^{-1}\). Scaling to our default luminosity \(\mathcal{L}=15\) pb\({}^{-1}\), the precision becomes \(\delta\alpha_{E}=0.0013\) and \(\delta\sigma_{E}=0.0013\).

### Differential scale and resolution

The calibration uses a (large) sample of reconstructed \(Z\to\ell\ell\) events and a corresponding simulated sample (representing our knowledge of the \(Z\) lineshape). For each event the two leptons are assigned to bins \(i\) and \(j\) (choosing \(i\geq j\)) according to energy/momentum, \(\eta\), and/or \(\phi\). Based on the lepton bins, events are divided into categories \((i,j)\), as shown in Figure 19.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{c c c c} \hline \hline Transverse lepton momentum, \(p_{T}^{\ell}\) & \multicolumn{2}{c}{Transverse \(W\) mass, \(m_{T}^{W}\)} \\ Fitting range [GeV] & \(\sigma_{\text{stat.}}\) [MeV] & Fitting range [GeV] & \(\sigma_{\text{stat.}}\) [MeV] \\ \hline
10-80 & 87 & 20-160 & 54 \\
20-70 & 93 & 40-140 & 55 \\
30-60 & 106 & 60-120 & 57 \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 4: Statistical uncertainty as a function of fitting range for \(p_{T}^{\ell}\) and \(m_{T}^{W}\) fits. The uncertainties in the \(p_{T}^{\ell}\) fit are larger, because the Jacobian edge is less sharp than in the \(m_{T}^{W}\) fit (see Figure 3).

Figure 19: Illustration of scheme to categorize \(Z\to\ell\ell\) events. Each lepton is assigned a bin according to its \(p_{T}\) and \(|\eta|\), here eight \(p_{T}\) bins and two \(|\eta|\) bins (barrel (**B**) and endcap (**E**)) thus \(8\times 2=16\) bins total, as demonstrated (left). \(Z\to\ell\ell\) events from data/simulation (middle box) are then divided into categories (squares right) according to the reconstructed/truth \(p_{T}\) and \(|\eta|\) bin of both leptons.

Figure 18: Fully simulated \(Z\) pseudo-data (dots with error bars), compared to an example \(Z\) resonance template with \(\alpha_{E}=1\), \(\sigma_{E}=0.02\), and to the best fit.

For each category \((i,j)\), the reconstructed sample is compared to the known \(Z\) lineshape (obtained from the corresponding simulated sample), and a \(Z\) mass resolution function \(R_{ij}\) is obtained from requiring that its convolution with the theoretical lineshape matches the reconstructed distribution (see Equation 7). Each of these \(Z\) mass resolutions \(R_{ij}\) is the direct result of combining two lepton momentum resolutions \(R_{i}\) and \(R_{j}\):

\[f(m_{Z})^{\rm Reco}_{ij}\ \ =\ \ f(m_{Z})^{\rm Truth}_{ij}\,\otimes\,R_{ij},\ \ \ \ \ R_{ij}\ \ =\ \ R_{i}\otimes R_{j} \tag{7}\]

The complicated lepton scale and resolution calibration can thus be split into two parts, which both saves computing time and allows for intermediate checks and changes.

Given \(N\) lepton bins and thus lepton resolution functions to determine, there are \(N\times(N+1)/2\)\(Z\) mass resolution functions, and thus the overconstrained system can be solved by a global \(\chi^{2}\) fit. This calibration procedure is illustrated in Figure 20, and allows for a determination of the detector response for all combinations of \(p_{T}\) and \(\eta\).

A simplified version of the above analysis has been performed, with the aim of obtaining only the scales. In this simplified procedure, the resolution functions \(R\) in Equation 7 reduces to calibration constants. The result of the calibration using the full \(Z\) samples (see Table 1) is shown for both electrons and muons in Figure 21, along with the scales obtained from the truth information.

As can be seen from the figure, the simplified calibration yields the correct behaviour of the scales in general. Some fluctuations around the expected values are observed induced by the above simplifications. Scaled to \(15\,\,\mathrm{pb}^{-1}\), the uncertainties are to be increased by a factor 3.8 and 2.4 for electrons and muons, respectively.

Figure 20: For each category a \(Z\) mass resolution function (middle) is determined from folding it with the simulated distribution to match the reconstructed one (left). The lepton bias and resolution parameters are determined for each of the 16 lepton bins, by globally fitting the \(16\times 17/2=136\)\(Z\) mass resolutions, which each is a result of two individual lepton resolutions (right).

### Lepton reconstruction efficiency

The \(p_{T}^{\ell}\) and \(m_{T}^{W}\) distributions of \(W\) events are also influenced by any \(p_{T}\) and \(\eta\) dependence of the lepton reconstruction efficiency. Any difference between the data and the simulation used to produce the templates will induce a difference in the distribution and cause a bias in the \(W\) mass fit.

Though the method to obtain the (differential) efficiency is conceptually the same for electrons and muons, the two cases are different in that electron reconstruction is generally more dependent on \(p_{T}\) and \(\eta\) than the muon reconstruction. For this reason, we have chosen to consider the electron reconstruction efficiency in the following. The electron reconstruction efficiency can be determined from the data with \(Z\) events, using the so-called "tag and probe" method [10], which we briefly summarize here. Events are selected with one well-identified electron, and an additional high \(p_{T}\) object. The invariant mass of these two objects is required to be within 10 \(\mathrm{\,Ge\kern-1.0ptV}\) of the nominal \(Z\) boson mass. Assuming that this selects \(Z\) events with enough purity, the identification efficiency is then simply obtained by computing the fraction of events where the second object is indeed identified as an electron. The efficiency of the isolation criterion is obtained in a similar way.

The studies reported in [17] indicate that for an integrated luminosity of 100 \(\mathrm{pb}^{-1}\), the electron efficiency can be reconstructed with a precision of 1.5% in the range \(20<p_{T}^{e}<70\)\(\mathrm{\,Ge\kern-1.0ptV}\). The uncertainty is statistically dominated. Scaling this number down to \(\mathcal{L}=15\)\(\mathrm{pb}^{-1}\), we anticipate a precision of 3.9%.

## 7 Background uncertainties

The leptonic \(W\) channel does not suffer from large backgrounds, due to the high cross section and the cleanness of the signal. The backgrounds are mostly from similar vector boson decays, such as \(W\to\tau(\to\ell\nu\nu)\nu\), \(Z\to\ell\ell\) (missing one lepton), and \(Z\to\tau(\to\ell\nu\nu)\tau\). With the good particle identification capabilities of the ATLAS detector [13], jet events will despite their large cross section

Figure 21: Lepton scale constants for electrons (a) and muons (b) as obtained from simplified calibration to the \(Z\) peak (squares) and from truth (circles) using full \(Z\) samples (see Table 1). The first eight bins are scale constants for leptons of increasing \(p_{T}\) reconstructed in the barrel, while the last eight are for those in the endcap (see text). The result is in good agreement with average scale of \(0.9958\pm 0.0003\) (indicated by the line in plot (a)) found in Section 6.1.

not be dominant. The backgrounds from \(t\bar{t}\) and \(W^{+}W^{-}\) events are negligible. The backgrounds and the uncertainties in their sizes are estimated below.

\(W\to\tau(\to\ell\nu\nu)\nu\) events:A large background (largest in the electron channel) is from \(W\to\tau\nu\) events, where the \(\tau\) decays into a lepton. This background is irreducible, as the final state is identical to the signal; however, its \(p_{T}^{\ell}\) and \(m_{T}^{W}\) distributions are generally below the fitting range, as both the lepton and missing momentum are much reduced, leaving only a tail into the fitting range. Though a quite significant background, its uncertainty is small, as only the \(\tau\to\ell X\) branching ratio (1.0%) and the acceptance relative to the signal (2.5%) enter.

\(Z\to\ell\ell\) events:Another large background (largest in the muon channel) comes from \(Z\to ll\) events, where one lepton is either undetected or not identified. A loose lepton identification for the second lepton can reduce this background, and possibly further reduction can be obtained with a \(Z\) veto, should the associated uncertainty still be significant. We do not apply this veto in the present analysis. The \(Z\to\ell\ell\) background extends significantly into the \(p_{T}^{\ell}\) and \(m_{T}^{W}\) distributions, except in the \(m_{T}^{W}\) electron channel, where the missed electron cluster still reduces the missing momentum, effectively lowering the apparent \(m_{T}^{W}\). The size of this background has uncertainties from the \(W\) to \(Z\) cross section ratio \(R_{WZ}\) (1.8%), \(Z\) veto efficiency (2.0%), and the acceptance (2.5%).

\(Z\to\tau(\to\ell\nu\nu)\tau\) events:A small background origins from \(Z\to\tau\tau\) events, where one \(\tau\) decays leptonically, while the other is not identified. While the cross section for such a process is small, it can fake missing momentum. The largest uncertainty in the size of this background comes from the \(\tau\) detector response (5.0%), along with cross section ratio \(R_{WZ}\) (1.8%), and acceptance (2.5%).

Jet events:This background is not studied here, because it can not be evaluated reliably using simulation only. Relying on Tevatron experience [16], we will assume it is small and it will not be discussed in this note.

Impact of backgrounds:If the size and shape of the backgrounds were perfectly known, then they would not affect the \(W\) mass measurement, as they could be included in the templates. It is thus the uncertainty on the size and shape of the backgrounds, in the fitting range of the \(p_{T}^{\ell}\) and \(m_{T}^{W}\) spectra, which gives rise to systematic errors. The uncertainties on the size of backgrounds arise from uncertainties relative to those of the signal events in cross sections, branching ratios and acceptances. These

are obtained from PDG [1] and efficiency studies (see Section 6.3).

The background shapes are determined from simulation. They are essentially unaffected by variations in the production, decay and resolution model. For jet events background, which was ignored in the present study, both normalisation and shape will have to be measured directly from the data.

We first assess the overall impact of the backgrounds. The backgrounds remaining after the selection described in Section 2.2 are given in Table 5, and the \(p_{T}\) spectrum of each process is shown in Figure 22.

Ignoring the background altogether in the templates leads to a bias \(\delta m_{W}=-10\) MeV. This is however the result of a conspiracy : the \(W\rightarrow\tau\nu\) background alone gives a bias of \(-80\) MeV, while the \(Z\rightarrow\ell\ell\) background gives a bias of \(+70\) MeV; both sources of background can vary independently within the uncertainties given above. The other backgrounds have negligible impact. We thus estimate the bias per percent relative error on the background normalization (checked to scale linearly with the size of the background) to be:

\[\partial m_{W}/\partial N_{\tau\nu-\mathrm{hkg}} = -0.8\ \mathrm{MeV}/\mathrm{\%}, \tag{8}\] \[\partial m_{W}/\partial N_{\ell\ell-\mathrm{hkg}} = \phantom{-}0.7\ \mathrm{MeV}/\mathrm{\%}. \tag{9}\]

We remind that the above does not include the jet events study.

## 8 Summary of uncertainties for \(\mathcal{L}=15\) pb\({}^{-1}\)

The response parameters determined _in situ_ using \(Z\) events (cf. Section 6.1) are used to produce templates of the \(p_{T}^{\ell}\) spectrum in \(W\) events, as shown in Figure 23, for the electron channel. The resulting fit yields \(m_{W}=80.466\pm 0.110\) GeV, with no bias with respect to the true value. This results shows that for \(\mathcal{L}=15\) pb\({}^{-1}\), propagating a global scale determined on \(Z\) events does not induce a significant bias in the analysis. Given that the global scale calibration had a precision of 0.13% and Equation 3,

Figure 22: \(p_{T}\) distribution for signal and backgrounds for electrons (a) and muons (b) after the selections described in Section 2.2. The \(p_{T}\) range used in the mass fit is \(30<p_{T}<60\) GeV.

the scale-induced systematic uncertainty is \(\delta m_{W}(\alpha_{E})=110\) MeV. Likewise, the resolution uncertainty contributes \(\delta m_{W}(\sigma_{E})=5\) MeV.

We did not attempt to control the non gaussian tails _in situ_. We assume that this contribution can be determined to 5% with 15 pb\({}^{-1}\), yielding a contribution of 28 MeV to the systematic uncertainty. As can be seen by comparing Figure 4 and Figure 12, the effect is smaller in the muon channel.

The expected precision of the _in situ_ efficiency measurement (Section 6.3) and Equation 5 imply a systematic uncertainty on the fit result of about \(\delta m_{W}=14\) MeV. This result holds for the electron channel. Given the flatness of the muon reconstruction efficiency, the systematic uncertainty in the muon channel is expected to be much smaller.

It was not attempted to determine the recoil calibration _in situ_. We assume that this calibration can be performed to 1%, yielding a systematic contribution of 200 MeV from Equation 6. This contribution affects the transverse mass analysis only.

The background uncertainty is discussed in the electron channel, and assumed identical in the muon channel. The \(Z\to\tau\tau\) background is negligible. Given the current knowledge of the \(W\) and \(\tau\) branching ratios [1], a realistic estimate of the \(\tau\) background uncertainty is 2.5%. Injecting the nominal background in the templates, then varying them within this range, we find a systematic uncertainty \(\delta m_{W}(\mathrm{u_{sg}})=2\) MeV. Similarly, the contribution from the \(Z\to ee\) background is found to be 2 MeV. The total background contribution to the systematic uncertainty is thus expected to be 3 MeV.

A detailed discussion of theoretical uncertainties is provided in [15]. At the start-up of LHC, the dominant theoretical contribution comes from the proton parton density functions, which contribute 25 MeV.

In summary, for an integrated luminosity of 15 pb\({}^{-1}\), we found that the analysis of the \(p_{T}^{\ell}\) spectrum gives a statistical sensitivity of about \(\delta m_{W}=110\) MeV per channel, while the transverse mass provides \(\delta m_{W}=60\) MeV. These numbers have experimental systematic uncertainties of 114 MeV in the \(p_{T}^{\ell}\) analysis, and 230 MeV in the transverse mass analysis. The uncertainty on the lepton and recoil

scales dominate these numbers. Finally, the uncertainty from PDFs is about 25 MeV and comparatively small. Our numbers are summarized in Table 6.

## 9 Conclusions

This note presents a first attempt towards \(m_{W}\) fits, confronting distributions obtained from fully simulated \(W\to e\nu,\mu\nu\) events to templates produced using a simplified detector model.

The simplified detector model used here relies on empirical functions to describe the energy and momentum scale, resolution, and non-gaussian tails, as well as the lepton selection efficiency. These functions are first determined, as a function of \(p_{T}\) and \(\eta\), using simulated \(W\) events, i.e. the signal itself; the resulting fit, unbiased, provides a technical validation of the method.

In a second step, the model parameters are used as extracted _in situ_, from the analysis of \(Z\) events. The \(Z\) peak provides the detector scale and resolution; the tag-and-probe method [10], applied to its decay leptons, is used to estimate the efficiency. A fit of the \(Z\)-based templates to the \(W\) data again shows no significant bias.

Our current approach can thus be considered valid, within a statistical sensitivity of about 60 MeV, for the transverse mass-based fit in the muon channel, and of 120 MeV for the transverse momentum-based fit in the electron channel.

This note has focused on experimental issues. Phenomenological uncertainties, related to QED, QCD and parton density functions are discussed in detail in [15].
