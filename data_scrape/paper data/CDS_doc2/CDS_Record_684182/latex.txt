Introduction

Jets with large transverse energy (\(E_{T}\)) are abundantly produced in hadron collisions. Cross sections for these QCD-induced processes are large and precise measurements have been obtained at the \(p\overline{p}\) colliders \(\mathrm{S}p\overline{p}\mathrm{S}\) and TEVATRON up to 500 GeV in \(E_{T}\). On the theoretical side, calculations of cross section predictions are available at NLO. These depend upon the parton density distributions (PDF's), which have to be convoluted with the partonic cross sections. Large-\(E_{T}\) jet production data have in turn been used to constrain PDF parameterizations. Detailed comparisons of theoretical predictions and experimental data have been carried out, which depend on the precision of the PDF's and the knowledge of the strong coupling constant.

Measurements of \(\alpha_{s}\) at hadron colliders are cumbersome by the structure of the proton, in particular the gluon PDF and \(\alpha_{s}\) are strongly correlated. An extraction of \(\alpha_{s}\) using a given PDF set can therefore at best return the input value, which was injected in the PDF fits, serving as consistency check. A method has been pioneered in Ref. [1], which uses PDF's with variable values of \(\alpha_{s}\). This method allows for a measurement of \(\alpha_{s}\) which is independent of the input \(\alpha_{s}\) of the PDF's.

In this paper a similar method is proposed and applied to single inclusive jet production. The cross section predictions obtained with different PDF families and for variable \(\alpha_{s}\) values are parameterized. The result of the parameterization are simple analytical functions \(f(E_{T},\alpha_{s}(E_{T}))\) which return the cross section for a given range of jet transverse energy and \(\alpha_{s}\). The inverse of these functions can be used to obtain from a cross section measurement the coupling constant as function of the jet \(E_{T}\).

This paper is organized as follows: In Section 2 the cross section measurements are outlined, both for existing data at the TEVATRON and for expectations at the LHC. In Section 3 the theoretical predictions are parameterized. The method for a measurement of \(\alpha_{s}\) is presented in Section 4 and systematic uncertainties are given in Section 5. Finally, the results are discussed in Section 6.

## 2 Single Inclusive Jet Cross Section

Single inclusive jet production serves in this paper as an example observable for cross section parameterizations. Dijet production, multi-jet rates and event shapes deserve separate studies. As a guideline, the cross section measurements provided by CDF [2] and D0 [3] are used for \(p\overline{p}\) at \(\sqrt{s}=1.8\) TeV, and the expectations evaluated by ATLAS[5] for \(pp\) at \(\sqrt{s}=14\) TeV 1.

Footnote 1: In the following 1.8 TeV refers to \(p\overline{p}\) scattering and 14 TeV to \(pp\) scattering

In these analyses, jets were reconstructed using a cone algorithm with \(R=\sqrt{\Delta\eta^{2}+\Delta\Phi^{2}}\)=0.7, where the pseudo-rapidity is defined as \(\eta=-\ln(\tan\frac{\theta}{2})\) with the polar angle \(\theta\) with respect to the beam axis and the azimuthal angle \(\Phi\) around the beam. The single inclusive cross section \(\frac{d^{2}\sigma}{dE_{T}d\eta}\) is in general calculated as \(NC/(\Delta E_{T}\Delta\eta\epsilon{\cal L})\), where \(N\) is the total number of jets in a given range of \(E_{T}\) and \(\eta\) of respective widths \(\Delta E_{T}\) and \(\Delta\eta\), \(C\) is a correction for the energy resolution, \(\epsilon\) the selection efficiency and \({\cal L}\) the integrated luminosity. Note that a single event can contribute several times to the cross section, for each jet above threshold. The cross section measurement of CDF [2] (based on 19.5 pb\({}^{-1}\)) is shown in Fig. 1 as well as the one of D0 [3] (based on 92 pb\({}^{-1}\)). CDF has recently updated their measurement [4].

An estimation of the expected cross section at the LHC is given in Ref. [5]. This cross section has been simulated with PYTHIA [6] and corrected by K-factors for higher order processes. The expectation for a total integrated luminosity of 300 fb\({}^{-1}\) is shown in Fig. 2.

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:3]

### Theoretical predictions

For the remainder of this article, the inclusive cross section will be considered in two pseudorapidity ranges, \(|\eta|\leq 0.5\) and \(0.1\leq|\eta|\leq 0.7\) (TEVATRON case), \(|\eta|\leq 1.5\) and \(1.5<|\eta|\leq 3.2\) (LHC case). The binning in \(E_{T}\) of the differential cross section follows the one used by D0 at 1.8 TeV and an appropriate choice at 14 TeV. NLO cross section calculations are obtained using JETRAD [7] with the following PDF sets: CTEQ4A [8], GRV94A [9] and MRSAP [10]. Different values of \(\alpha_{s}\) have been used in the A-series of these PDF's, as summarized in Table 1. The initial non-perturbative PDF's are parameterized at some small reference scale \(Q_{0}\), the evolution is done within the \(\overline{MS}\) scheme at NLO. The value of the strong coupling constant is usually set in the PDF's through the scale \(\Lambda_{\overline{MS}}^{(4)}\), for four active flavours 2. The running of the coupling to a given scale \(Q\) (with \(n_{f}\) active flavours) is done at two-loop accuracy with matching \(\alpha_{s}\) at the quark thresholds (\(m_{c}\)=1.5 GeV, \(m_{b}\)=4.5 GeV and \(m_{t}\)=175 GeV).

Footnote 2: For the remainder of this paper \(\Lambda\) always refers to \(\Lambda_{\overline{MS}}^{(4)}\)

The renormalization scale \(\mu_{R}\) and the factorization scale \(\mu_{F}\) were set to the maximum transverse energy in the event. A variation of these scales is part of the systematic studies discussed later. In order to mimic the experimental jet finding procedure, partons were merged in a single jet if their separation is less than \(R_{\,sep}=1.3R\), and if they are within \(R=0.7\) of their \(E_{T}\)-weighted \(\eta-\phi\) centroid. The cross section predictions for TEVATRON and LHC are shown in Fig. 3. These are obtained with CTEQ4M and \(\Lambda\) = 300 MeV.

### \(\alpha_{s}\) dependence of the total cross section

The total cross section exhibits an almost linear dependence on \(\alpha_{s}\). This dependence is shown in Fig. 4, where the total cross section has been computed in a central range of \(\eta\) and for the range of \(E_{T}\) used for differential cross sections. Calculations with different PDF's are given as function of \(\alpha_{s}(M_{Z})\) rather than as function of \(\Lambda\). This choice is certainly not unique, since the relevant scale of jet production is not constant, but depends on \(E_{T}\). The mean \(E_{T}\) at TEVATRON is 92 GeV and is 500 GeV at LHC. These values are subject to small changes with respect to \(\alpha_{s}\) or the PDF. At LHC, \(\alpha_{s}(500\) GeV) might be a more appropriate choice, though the difference between \(\alpha_{s}(M_{Z})\) and \(\alpha_{s}(500\) GeV) is below 20 % for a given value of \(\Lambda\).

Over the range of \(\alpha_{s}\) considered, i.e. from 0.11 to 0.13, the change of the total cross section is about 25 % at TEVATRON and 20 % at LHC. CTEQ4M tends to predict lower cross sections in both cases, GRV94A predicts larger values and MRSAP is in between. The spread between the predictions increases with \(\alpha_{s}\). Statistical uncertainties of the cross section calculations are about 0.3 %. The spread due to the PDF's e.g. at \(\alpha_{s}=0.112\) corresponds to 10 times the statistical uncertainty. For the sake of simplicity, the difference between the prediction calculated with different PDF's is taken as measure of the systematic uncertainty. Note that this approach does not include the full PDF-related uncertainty, a more profound discussion can be found e.g. in [11].

\end{table}

A linear fit including all points calculated has been performed. The corresponding parameters are given in Table 2. Results obtained with MRSAP points alone are statistically consistent with the full result. This can be explained by the fact that the range in \(\alpha_{s}\) used by MRSAP is large and extends in particular to higher values of \(\alpha_{s}\), dominating the full fit result with this large lever arm. Systematic errors given in Table 2 are obtained with fits to CTEQ4M and GRV94A predictions respectively.

Quadratic functions have also been tried, but did not improve significantly the quality of the

fit. At NLO, the partonic cross section is of the form

\[\sigma=A\,\alpha_{s}^{2}(\mu)+B\,\alpha_{s}^{3}(\mu)\,,\]

but the quadratic dominance is apparently washed out in the hadronic cross section by the convolution with the PDF's.

### \(\alpha_{s}\) dependence of the differential cross section

More information on \(\alpha_{s}\) will be gained from the differential jet cross section. Its dependence on \(\alpha_{s}\) is shown in Fig. 5. As an illustrative example, the predictions calculated with MRSAP have been normalized to the nominal set with \(\Lambda\) = 366 MeV. The dependence of the total cross section can be traced back to a change in the shape of the differential cross section with \(\alpha_{s}\). Larger values of \(\Lambda\) lead to larger cross sections at small \(E_{T}\) and to smaller cross sections at large \(E_{T}\). The total cross section is dominated by jet production at small \(E_{T}\), and its change of 20 % is accompanied by a change of 20 % of the differential cross section at small \(E_{T}\).

Figure 4: The total cross section for central jet production at large \(E_{T}\) calculated with different PDFâ€™s as function of \(\alpha_{s}(M_{Z})\). The upper plot shows the TEVATRON case, the lower one the LHC case. A linear dependence has been fitted to the calculated cross sections, including either all PDF sets or individual subsets (CTEQ4M, MRSAP, GRV94).

At large \(E_{T}\), in contrast, the change is opposite. In between, at about 150-300 GeV at \(\sqrt{s}\)=1.8 TeV and at about 700-1 500 GeV at \(\sqrt{s}\)=14 TeV, the cross section is basically insensitive to variations of \(\Lambda\). This region will not be useful for determinations of \(\alpha_{s}\), but might be interesting for normalization purposes when comparing with measurements, as advised in [1].

Another normalization procedure is applied here by dividing the differential cross section by the total cross section, calculated in the relevant kinematic range :

\[\frac{d^{2}\sigma^{norm}}{dE_{T}d\eta}=\frac{1}{\sigma_{tot}}\frac{d^{2} \sigma}{dE_{T}d\eta}\;,\;\;\sigma_{tot}=\int_{E_{T}^{min}}^{E_{T}^{max}}\int_{ \eta^{min}}^{\eta^{max}}\frac{d^{2}\sigma}{dE_{T}^{t}d\eta^{\prime}}dE_{T}^{t }d\eta^{\prime}\;.\]

The integral over the normalized differential cross section \(\frac{d^{2}\sigma^{norm}}{dE_{T}d\eta}\) equals to one. This unfolds the dependence of the total cross section on \(\alpha_{s}\) and concentrates on the shape dependence. The slope variation of the distribution is shown in Fig. 6. The region of insensitivity is then moved towards the lower \(E_{T}\) edge of the distribution, which corresponds to the total cross section. Note that the slope is unchanged by the normalization procedure, but range of interest for \(\alpha_{s}\) measurements might be more appropriate.

Figure 5: Ratio of cross sections to a reference cross section obtained with MRSAP (\(\Lambda\) = 366 MeV).

The predictions for normalized differential cross sections will be parameterized in the following section.

## 3 Jet Cross Section Parameterization

The normalized differential cross sections at TEVATRON and LHC energies are parameterized in 24 respectively 19 bins of \(E_{T}\) and for two regions of pseudorapity (central and forward). In each bin of \(E_{T}\), the cross section dependence on \(\alpha_{s}(E_{T})\), as calculated at NLO with JETRAD for various sets of PDF's, is fitted with linear and quadratic functions. The linear fit results are shown in Fig. 7 for a few representative bins (at TEVATRON).

The sensitivity to \(\alpha_{s}\) increases with increasing \(E_{T}\). Between 70 and 80 GeV the dependence of the cross section on \(\alpha_{s}\) is almost flat. From 80 GeV on, in each bin of \(E_{T}\), the cross section falls with increasing \(\alpha_{s}\), approximately linearly. In that region, CTEQ4M predicts the largest cross sections and GRV94a the smallest ones, while MRSAP is in between both. At very high \(E_{T}\), above 350 GeV, GRV94a and MRSAP are close while CTEQ4M still yields higher cross sections. The spread

between different predictions also increases with \(E_{T}\). All PDF predictions are included in the global linear fit, in which case an average prediction is obtained. Quadratic fits yield a little better description in the central region of \(\alpha_{s}\), but diverge faster at large and small values of \(\alpha_{s}\). These 3-parameter fits tend to be dominated by single points at extreme \(\alpha_{s}\), which are provided by MRSAP. In orderer to qualitatively demonstrate the spread between different PDF's, fits are applied to the predictions of individual PDF groups.

The same type of parameterization is performed at LHC, the results are shown in Fig. 8.

The features at LHC are similar to TEVATRON. Good sensitivity to \(\alpha_{s}\) is obtained above 300 GeV in \(E_{T}\). A strong dependence of the cross section on \(\alpha_{s}\) is observed at very large \(E_{T}\), on a relatively small range of \(\alpha_{S}(E_{T})\).

The quality of the parameterization depends on \(E_{T}\) and is given by the spread between different PDF's. To quantify this effect, the mean relative residual \(\overline{r}\) of the NLO calculation with respect to the result of the parameterization is introduced:

\[\overline{r}=\frac{1}{N_{P\,DF}}\sum_{i=1}^{N_{PDF}}\frac{\left[\frac{d^{2} \sigma}{dE_{T}d\eta}(NLO)-\frac{d^{2}\sigma}{dE_{T}d\eta}(param)\right]}{ \frac{d^{2}\sigma}{dE_{T}d\eta}(NLO)}\;\;.\]

All 15 different PDF's given in Table 1 are included in \(\overline{r}\). This quantity is shown in Fig. 9 as function of \(E_{T}\), the corresponding RMS is shown as error. The residuals are below 1 % at small \(E_{T}\) and increase up to 5 % at large \(E_{T}\). At large \(E_{T}\) the residuals are dominated by the difference between CTEQ4M on one side and GRV94a and MRSAP on the other side. At LHC the overall parameterization quality is slightly worse than at TEVATRON. Also shown in Fig. 9 are the residuals for a quadratic functional form. Theses are found to be slightly better in terms of mean residual, but worse in terms of the RMS. It can be expected that parameterization quality will improve in future with an increased knowledge of the PDF's.

The linear parameterization of the cross section dependence, \(\sigma^{norm}(E_{T})=a(E_{T})+b(E_{T})\). \(\alpha_{s}(E_{T})\) gives a simple and stable description. Offsets and slopes of these functions depend on \(E_{T}\) in a way similar to the cross sections themselves. The offset \(a\) and the slope term \(b\cdot\alpha_{s}\) are of the order of magnitude of the normalized cross section, the slope \(b\) expresses the cross section dependence on \(\alpha_{s}(E_{T})\) in that bin. The slope is negative except at small \(E_{T}\). The parameters of the linear fit result are shown in Fig. 10

Measurement of \(\alpha_{s}\)

Having parameterized the normalized differential cross section in each bin of \(E_{T}\), the inversion of parameterization can be used to determine \(\alpha_{s}(E_{T})\) from a given cross section measurement. In the case of the linear parameterization the inversion is trivial:

\[\sigma^{\mbox{\tiny\it nor}}(E_{T}) = a(E_{T})+b(E_{T})\cdot\alpha_{s}(E_{T})\;,\] \[\alpha_{s}(E_{T}) = \frac{\sigma^{\mbox{\tiny\it norm}}(E_{T})-a(E_{T})}{b(E_{T})}\;,\]

and for the quadratic Ansatz an equivalent inversion is applied. However, in the latter case no unique real solution is guaranteed, and a choice has to be made to exclude unphysical solutions.

To test the method of extracting \(\alpha_{s}\), the same data sets of generated cross section, which have already been used for the parameterizations, are now considered as 'data'. The aim of this exercise is to study biases, which are introduced by imperfections of the parameterization. An illustrative example using a linear parameterization of the central pseudorapidity cross section is shown in Fig. 11.

In the first bins of \(E_{T}\) the extraction of \(\alpha_{s}\) is problematic because of limited sensitivity. At larger values of \(E_{T}\) the method works well, the residual bias in terms of \(\alpha_{s}(M_{Z})\) is in average of the order of a few %. Another example is shown in Fig. 12, where the quadratic parameterization is applied to GRV94A calculation of the forward cross section. Here, the deviations from the expectations are larger, and in the case of LHC the region of insensitivity to \(\alpha_{s}\) is found in between 350 and 700 GeV. These bins are not taken into account to reconstruct \(\Lambda\frac{(4)}{MS}\).

A fit of the 2-loop evolution of the running coupling has been applied above 90 GeV at TEVATRON (both central and forward) and above 300 GeV at LHC in the central region of jet production to the extracted values of \(\alpha_{s}(E_{T})\). The forward jet cross section at LHC \(1.5\leq|\eta|\leq 3.2\) is fitted from 200 to 350 GeV and from 0.7 to 3.0 TeV, with the range between 350 and 700 GeV being excluded due to the lack of sensitivity. A comparison of the reconstructed \(\alpha_{s}(M_{Z})\) and the one used in the generator for the cross section calculation reflects directly the bias of the method. This comparison is given in Table 3.

The evolution used in the generation of the cross section is shown as full line. Errors bars shown correspond to the RMS of iterations of the phase space integration. The lower graphs show the ratio of extracted values of \(\alpha_{s}\) to the expected ones obtained with the value of \(\Lambda\) used in the Monte Carlo cross section calculation. A deviation from the expected evolution can be seen at low \(E_{T}\), where the normalized cross section is insensitive to \(\alpha_{s}\). These points are excluded from the evolution fit.

The extracted values are fitted with the evolution function to determine \(\Lambda_{\overline{MS}}^{\{4\}}\) (dashed line). At LHC, the values between 350 and 700 GeV are not included in the fit. In the region of insensitivity small fluctuations of the cross section calculation lead to large deviations of \(\alpha_{s}\) from the expected evolution. The evolution used in the generation of the cross section is shown as a full line. The lower graphs show the ratio of extracted values of \(\alpha_{s}\) to the expected ones obtained with the value of \(\Lambda\) used in the Monte Carlo cross section calculation.

Statistical uncertainties of the cross section generation lead to typical uncertainties of \(\alpha_{s}(M_{Z})\) of 0.1%. The deviations of the reconstructed \(\alpha_{s}\) from the generated ones have to be seen as systematic uncertainties stemming from the choice of PDF's used for the cross section parameterization.

## 5 Systematic uncertainties

In order to assess systematic uncertainties of the method presented, the following studies are performed. The dependence on the PDF set, on the functional form of the parameterization, the dependence on renormalization and factorization scale. In addition the difference between central and forward region is studied, as a stability check rather than as source of systematic error. These tests are operated on both the fitted value of \(\alpha_{s}(M_{Z})\) and the measurement of \(\alpha_{s}(E_{T})\) as function of \(E_{T}\).

The differences between the nominal \(\alpha_{s}\) and the reconstructed ones are averaged within the groups of PDF's. In principal the error depend on \(\alpha_{s}\) and could be parameterized. Here, for simplicity, the mean error is quoted. Resulting errors in terms of \(\alpha_{s}(M_{Z})\) are listed in Table 4 for 1.8 TeV and in Table 5 for 14 TeV.

At TEVATRON the largest bias effect is obtained with CTEQ4M, small differences are found between the linear and the quadratic forms. Small differences are also observed between the two sets at different pseudorapidity; not surprising since the overlap is large. The errors at LHC are slightly larger, CTEQ4M and GRV94A related errors are of similar size. The forward region seems preferable, but the range in \(E_{T}\) is limited to 3 TeV and experimental systematic uncertainties are likely to be less understood. Furthermore, perturbative uncertainties are much larger in forward direction (see below).

\end{table}
Table 5: Systematic uncertainties of \(\alpha_{s}(M_{Z})\) related to the choice of the PDF set at LHC. Shown are the results in two different ranges of pseudorapidity and for two types of cross section parameterizations.

The uncertainty related to the choice of the parametric function form is summarized in Table 6. Here, the maximum deviation from the nominal result has been taken as error. In general and in particular in the central region the errors at LHC are somewhat smaller than at TEVATRON.

No difference is observed between the two \(\eta\) ranges at TEVATRON within the statistical error, since the two bins are almost identical. The choice of these two ranges is motivated by the availability of real data provided by the D0 collaboration. At LHC the ranges are chosen without overlap and the corresponding error is about 1.2-2 %. Further studies should address the \(\eta\)-dependence by analyzing data in smaller \(\eta\) bins. As indicated by the ATLAS collaboration [5], a binning of \(|\eta|\leq 1.0,\ 1.0\leq|\eta|\leq 2.0\) and \(2.0\leq|\eta|\leq 3.0\) appears to be reasonable, but could be chosen finer as well.

Most prominent perturbative uncertainties arise from the choice of the renormalization scale \(\mu_{R}\) and the factorization scale \(\mu_{F}\). The renormalization scale sets the scale at which the coupling constant is to be evaluated, e.g. in the partonic cross section formulae. The factorization scale separates bound state effects embodied in the PDF's from perturbative processes described by the partonic cross sections. Physical cross sections do indeed not depend upon any of these scales, but truncating a perturbative series at finite order introduces a residual \(\mu_{R}(\mu_{F})\)-dependence. It is believed that this dependence actually indicates the size of yet uncalculated higher order terms.

The natural choice \(\mu_{R}=\mu_{F}=E_{T}\) is adopted here, but there are no compelling arguments for this particular choice, except that the scales should be of the order of the natural scale, \(Q=E_{T}\). The TEVATRON experiments use a value of \(0.5\cdot E_{T}\) for both scales [2, 3]. Neither the range in which \(\mu_{R}\) and \(\mu_{F}\) should be varied is well defined. There seems to be a common understanding, however, that \(0.5Q\leq\mu\leq 2Q\) is a reasonable range, which is also applied in \(e^{+}e^{-}\) annihilations and deep inelastic \(ep\) scattering.

In the present case, the scale uncertainties are estimated by recalculating the cross sections with different settings of the scales for one particular PDF set, MRSAP with \(\Lambda_{\overline{MS}}^{(4)}=366\) MeV. Then the usual parameterization is applied to these new sets and \(\alpha_{s}\) is extracted. In principal all PDF sets would have to be re-generated and the parameterization repeated for all considered choices of \(\mu_{R}\) and \(\mu_{F}\). For the purpose of methodology, scale variations for a single PDF may serve to set the size of uncertainties. The \(\mu_{R}-\mu_{F}\) scale uncertainties for \(\alpha_{s}(M_{Z})\) are given in

In the forward region the perturbative uncertainties are very large, the method to extract \(\alpha_{s}\) from the jet cross section becomes unreliable.

### Summary of systematic uncertainties

Three different sources of systematic uncertainty are investigated. 15 sets of cross section calculations, subdivided into three families of PDF's, are used to extract \(\alpha_{s}(M_{Z})\). These same sets have already been used to parameterize the cross section. Re-using the same sets reveals the spread between PDF families, thus giving a measure of the PDF uncertainty. The errors are averaged within PDF families and the largest up- and downward deviations are taken as PDF error. A further uncertainty is related to the functional form of the parameterization. The difference between a linear and a quadratic form is calculated for all PDF sets. The maximum difference is assigned as systematic error. Finally, the dominant systematic uncertainty is of perturbative origin. It is estimated by varying independently the scales \(\mu_{R}\) and \(\mu_{F}\) in between \(0.5E_{T}\leq\mu\leq 2E_{T}\). Cross sections are recalculated with these scale setting using MRSAP with \(\Lambda_{\overline{MS}}^{(4)}=366\) MeV, and \(\alpha_{s}(M_{Z})\) is extracted using the nominal parameterization. The largest deviation in either direction from the expected result was taken as systematic error for missing higher orders. The summary of all systematic errors is given in Table 10 for TEVATRON and in Table 11 for LHC.

### A test with MRST

A more recent global analysis of parton distributions is provided by the MRST [12] group. Three PDF's with different \(\alpha_{s}\) are available. Unfortunately, in this version, a small bug in the evolution code was discovered by the authors [13] which affected the NLO\(P_{gg}\) splitting functions. A corrected version is available, but not yet interfaced to JETRAD. Cross section calculations obtained with these PDF's should therefore serve as stability check of the method, without being used for systematic error evaluation. The difference between the value of \(\alpha_{s}(M_{Z})\) used in MRST and the extracted one is given in Table 12 for TEVATRON and in Table 13 for LHC.

The bias encountered for MRST at TEVATRON are of the same size than for other PDF's. The situation is more complicated at LHC, where the effect is twice as large. It is in addition of opposite sign in the forward and in the central part of the cross section. In general the total cross section prediction is about 5-10 % lower with MRST compared to MRSAP, CTEQ4M and GRV94A. It would be desirable to repeat the present study with the newer PDF's MRST99, CTEQ5M and GRV99.

### A test with D0 data

Measurements of the single inclusive cross section are performed by the D0 and CDF collaborations. The ranges of pseudorapidity and the binning in \(E_{T}\) of the cross section calculations have been chosen to match the experimental data of D0. The result of the test on D0 data is shown in Fig. 15. Using the central cross section measurement \(|\eta|<0.5\) and applying a fit range from 90 to 560 GeV on \(\alpha_{s}(E_{T})\), a value of \(\alpha_{s}(M_{Z})=0.1176\pm 0.0003\) is determined with a \(\chi^{2}/N_{dof}\) of 2.8. The measurement in the forward region \(0.1\leq|\eta|\leq 0.7\) gives \(\alpha_{s}(M_{Z})=0.1227\pm 0.0003\) with a \(\chi^{2}/N_{dof}\) of 3.0. The results depend weakly on the parameterization function. Experimental uncertainties are not included, theoretical uncertainties are of the order of \(\pm 0.01\).

values of \(\alpha_{s}(M_{Z})\) lie within the expectation, though the \(\chi^{2}/N_{d\,b\,f}\) of the evolution fits indicates systematic deviations from the expected evolution. At low \(E_{T}\) the parameterization method is expected to be insensitive to \(\alpha_{s}\); this explains the observed large scatter of the measurements. Also at large \(E_{T}\) the slope of the measurement differs from the expectation. This discrepancy might be related to experimental distortions of the cross section shape, since the method is very shape sensitive. Higher order effects do also influence the shape. The difference between the measurement in the central and in the forward region (5%) reflects systematic uncertainties. Nevertheless, the capability of the parameterization method to determine the strong coupling constant within 10 % systematic error is demonstrated using data from D0.

## 6 Conclusions

The single inclusive jet cross section at TEVATRON and LHC has been analyzed for its sensitivity to the strong coupling constant. Various sets of parton distribution functions with variable \(\alpha_{s}(M_{Z})\) have been used for this purpose to calculate jet cross sections at next-to-leading order. The cross section spectra were normalized to a total jet cross section and their dependence on \(\alpha_{s}(E_{T})\) was parameterized with simple analytical functions. This parameterization can be used to extract \(\alpha_{s}(E_{T})\) from a given cross section measurement.

Intrinsic biases of this method were investigated. Systematic uncertainties stemming from the choice of a particular PDF set or parameterization form are estimated to be of the order of \(\pm 3\%\). The dominant uncertainty has perturbative origin, coming from yet uncalculated higher orders. These were estimated by varying renormalization and factorization scales. The resulting uncertainties are found to be of \(\pm 10\%\) at TEVATRON and of \(\pm 7\%\) at LHC.

In addition, stability checks of this method were performed with independent PDF sets and with a real measurement provided by the D0 collaboration. The result of these tests have consolidated the confidence in this method. A measurement of \(\alpha_{s}(M_{Z})\) up to scales of order TeV from jet production at hadron colliders with a 10 % accuracy seems achievable.

Further investigations are necessary to understand the dependence of the performance on the selected pseudorapidity range. An optimization of the cross section normalization procedure should be carried out to minimize the impact of experimental luminosity uncertainties. Since the parameterization method heavily relies on PDF sets with different values of \(\alpha_{s}(M_{Z})\), it would be highly desirable to have modern PDF's series in a reasonable range of \(\alpha_{s}\) values.

First \(\alpha_{s}(E_{T})\) is extracted from the cross section measurement, then these data are fitted by the two-loop evolution to determine \(\alpha_{s}(M_{Z})\). Only statistical uncertainties are taken into account. This analysis is done for two parameterization functions and in two ranges of pseudorapidity. At low \(E_{T}\) the normalized cross section is essentially insensitive to \(\alpha_{s}\), this region is excluded from the evolution fit. It is expected that small fluctuations of the cross section generate large deviation of \(\alpha_{s}\). This behaviour has is also observed using NLO calculations for normalized cross section (see figs. 11 12).
