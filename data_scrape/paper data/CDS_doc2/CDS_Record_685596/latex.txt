## 1 Introduction

In preparation for Run II at Fermilab, when the luminosity is expected to be \(7\times 10^{31}\) or higher, the CDF and D0 experiments have done studies of the beam-associated backgrounds expected, and have compared their simulations to measurements taken during Run I, when the luminosity was \(2\times 10^{30}\).

## 2 D0

The D0 geometry has been simulated by Sirotenko using the D0 GEANT code. The events were generated using DTUJET and low-energy particles were traced using GEANT 3.21 interfaced to CALOR (known as GCALOR). His results are reported in D0 Note 2512, dated March 12, 1995. He finds that the expected rates in the B and C layer scintillation counters are the highest, and that the counting rate is expected to be dominated by electrons. The comparison of the calculated and measured rates for Run I is as follows, assuming that the total rate is indeed from electrons:

\begin{tabular}{c c c} Counters & Calculated & Measured Rates per \(\mathit{cm}^{2}\) per second \\
2(B) & 40 & 47 \\
5(B) & 6 & 9 \\
3(C) & 50 & 28 \\ \end{tabular} Considering the complexity of the geometry and the fact that the simulation was done after the fact (so that the composition of the materials may not be well known), the assumption that all the rate is due to electrons, and the magnitude of the rates, this agreement is rather good.

In addition, D0 did another study using the MARS code, and found that the results from the two codes agreed well. These results are reported in D0 Note 2601, by Mokhov and Sirotenko, dated July 21, 1995. They also report in this note on the results of the installation of shielding in the Tevatron tunnel, to reduce backgrounds from the quadrupoles. Once again, the results are consistent with the calculations, and the primary background is from electrons.

In the D0 upgrade, there will be scintillation counters installed inside the calorimeter; backscatter of particles from the calorimeters will cause large rates in these counters. Simulations using MARS showed that polyethylene would be a more effective shield than iron; an experimental study confirmed this and gave a reduction in rates of a factor of 5, where the predicted reduction was a factor of 5.7. These results are reported in D0 Note 2685 by Diehl et al., August 3, 1995.

Another D0 study, by Striganov, which is reported in D0 Note 2711 (August 31, 1995), uses only standard GEANT simulations to track particles (although he does use the DTU JET93 event generator). He finds adequate agreement with observed rates in the D0 small-angle muon system (SAMUS) using a 1 MeV for hadrons, 10 keV for charged particles inside a drift tube sensitive volume, and no simulation of thermal neutron interactions. This is consistent with the above studies, which, although they did include the neutron transport code, found that the rates were dominated by charged particles.

## 3 Cdf

There is only one study done by CDF, reported in an unpublished note by Krivosheev and Mokhov, which is dated July 2, 1997. They used MARS to simulate the detector and the low-energy backgrounds. They also find that their rates in Run I are dominated by charged particles. Figure 7 of this note summarizes their results; at the inner radius, where rates are highest, the measurements are lower than the prediction by about a factor of 2. At the outer radius, where the rates are lowest, the measurements agree somewhat better with the prediction, but are higher in places by up to a factor of 4.

## 4 Conclusion

Measurements have been done of beam-associated backgrounds both at CDF and at D0 during Run I of the Tevatron at Fermilab. The results are consistent within the errors that ATLAS has forecast for its own calculations. However, it should be noted that the rates are almost entirely due to charged particles, and therefore that the predictions for neutron and gamma fluences are not addressed by these experiments yet. Both experiments have designed and are installing shielding for Run II, where the effects of neutrons and gammas are expected to be much more significant. This run is currently scheduled to begin in 2000, and so results should be available before the start of ATLAS, but perhaps not before the ATLAS shielding design will need to be finalized.
