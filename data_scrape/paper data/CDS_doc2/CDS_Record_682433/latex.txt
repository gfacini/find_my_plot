A study of the capability of the ATLAS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider

to measure the CP-violation parameter \(\alpha\) by using the decay channel \({\rm B^{0}_{d}\to\pi^{+}\pi^{-}}\) is described.

## 1. Introduction

The Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) triangle, formed by the matrix elements \(V_{\rm ub}\), \(V_{\rm td}\) and \(V_{\rm ed}\,V_{\rm eb}\) in the complex space, is expected to be sensitive to the complex phase of the CKM matrix, since the sides are of the same order of magnitude. The angle \(\alpha\), which is the angle opposite to the side \(V_{\rm ed}V_{\rm eb}\), can be measured from the asymmetry of the rates of the neutral \({\rm B}\) decays \({\rm B^{0}_{d}\to\pi^{+}\pi^{-}}\) and \({\rm\bar{B}^{0}_{d}\to\pi^{+}\pi^{-}}\).

Taking into account both the tree- and the penguin decay graphs, the time-dependent asymmetry can be written in the form [1]

\[A^{\rm CP}(t) = -2A_{\rm P}/A_{\rm T}\sin\,\delta\sin\,\alpha\cos\Delta mt \tag{1}\] \[- (\sin\,2\alpha+\,2A_{\rm P}/A_{\rm T}\cos\delta\,\cos 2\alpha \sin\,\alpha)\sin\,\Delta mt\] \[= \Lambda_{\rm e}\,\cos\Delta mt+\,\Lambda_{\rm s}\,\sin\,\Delta mt,\]

where \(A_{\rm P}/A_{\rm T}=\rho\) is the ratio of penguin to tree level amplitudes, estimated to be \(0.2\pm 0.2\). The angle \(\delta\) is related to final state interaction phase differences, and cannot be reliably calculated.

Assuming that the penguin amplitude is zero the asymmetry simplifies to

\[A^{\rm CP}(t)=-\sin\,2\alpha\sin\,\Delta mt, \tag{2}\]corresponding to \(\Lambda_{e}=0\), \(\Lambda_{e}=-\sin 2\alpha\). The observed asymmetry is

\[A^{\rm obs}(t) = \frac{N_{\rm total}(\pi^{+}\pi^{-}\ell^{+})(t)-N_{\rm total}(\pi^{+} \pi^{-}\ell^{-})(t)}{N_{\rm total}(\pi^{+}\pi^{-}\ell^{+})(t)+N_{\rm total}(\pi^ {+}\pi^{-}\ell^{-})(t)} \tag{3}\] \[\simeq D(A^{\rm CP}(t)+A^{\rm p}).\]

\(D\) is the product of all dilution factors, and \(A^{\rm p}\) is the production asymmetry of \(B^{0}_{\rm d}\) and \(B^{0}_{\rm d}\), estimated to be at the per-cent level [2].

One needs independent tagging to define whether the decaying B-meson was a \(B^{0}_{\rm d}\) or a \(B^{0}_{\rm d}\) at the time of its production. The statistical significance of the signal is reduced by wrong-sign tags as \(D_{\rm tag}=1-2\times W\), where \(W\) is the fraction of wrong-sign tags over the total number of tags. The signal is also diluted by background (\(D_{\rm back}=N_{\rm S}/N_{\rm total}\), where \(N_{\rm S}\) is the number of signal events and \(N_{\rm total}\) is the sum of the numbers of signal and background events), and \(D_{\rm acc}\) which accounts for fit acceptance and time resolution. In a time-integrated measurement \(D_{\rm acc}\) is replaced by \(D_{\rm int}\) which is the dilution factor coming from the time-integration of the time-dependent asymmetry. Here, the background is assumed to be asymmetry-free.

## 2. The Decay \(B^{0}_{\rm d}\rightarrow\pi^{+}\pi^{-}\)

Experimentally the decay mode \(B^{0}_{\rm d}\rightarrow\pi^{+}\pi^{-}\) is difficult due to the large background from other B decays. The branching fraction of this decay has not been measured yet; here, the branching fraction was assumed to be \(2\times 10^{-5}\). Large theoretical uncertainties concerning the relative fractions of the different decay mechanisms contribute to the systematic error, unless these fractions can be measured independently.

### Trigger requirements and rates

The level-1 trigger will be, as for any other B-decay channel, a single muon trigger with \(p_{\rm T}>6\) GeV/\(c\) and \(|\eta|<2.2\). This will give a total rate of about 8 kHz. To reduce the rate at level-2, the muon trigger threshold will be sharpened, bringing a reduction factor of two to the trigger rate. The inner tracker will be used to search for a pair of opposite-charge particles, each with \(p_{\rm T}>6\) GeV/\(c\), and the \(p_{\rm T}\) sum of the two particles greater than 15 GeV/\(c\). This gives a reduction factor of 20 in the trigger rate. Without the cut on the \(p_{\rm T}\) sum the reduction factor would be 10.

### Study of the vertex resolution

For the ATLAS Inner Detector equipped with the Si-strip layer at the radius of 6 cm, the following impact parameter resolutions have been calculated [3]:

\[\sigma_{\rm IP} = 14\,\oplus 72/(p_{\rm T}\sqrt{|\sin\theta|}) \tag{4}\] \[\sigma_{\rm Z} = 20\,\oplus 83/(p_{\rm T}\sqrt{|\sin\theta|}^{3}) \tag{5}\]

where \(\theta\) is the angle with respect to the beam line. The parametrization of \(\theta\) dependence assumes cylindrical detector layers. Half length of a layer at 6 cm should be around 20 cm. The parametrization is therefore valid for \(|\eta|<2\). This parametrization is referred to as the 'Panel' layout. The parametrized resolutions were found to agree quite well with results obtained by using a full GEANT simulation, charged particle reconstruction and vertex fitting.

In the absence of the first layer, for higher luminosity operation, the resolution is

\[\sigma_{\rm IP} = 30\oplus 220/(p_{\rm T}\sqrt{|\sin\theta|}) \tag{6}\] \[\sigma_{\rm z} = 39\oplus 240/(p_{\rm T}\sqrt{|\sin\theta|}^{3}) \tag{7}\]

assuming that the layer closest to the beam pipe is a Si pixel layer at \(R=11.5\) cm ('Panel' high luminosity layout).

The resolution on the radial position of the secondary vertex in \({\rm B}_{\rm d}^{0}\rightarrow\pi^{+}\pi^{-}\) decays has been studied using a detailed simulation of events in the high-precision semiconductor detectors. The resolution was studied for different vertex detector layouts by varying the impact parameter resolutions accordingly. The following resolutions were assumed:

* The 'Annecy' layout and a silicon strip layer at \(R=6\) cm ('Annecy + strip') \(\sigma_{\rm IP}=13\oplus 62/(p_{\rm T}\sqrt{|\sin\theta|})\), \(\sigma_{\rm z}=39\oplus 90/(p_{\rm T}\sqrt{|\sin\theta|}^{3})\)
* The 'Annecy' layout and a silicon strip layer at \(R=6\) cm, plus the second pixel layer at \(16.5\) cm is rotated by 90 degrees ('Annecy + strip + rotated pixels') \(\sigma_{\rm IP}=13\oplus 62/(p_{\rm T}\sqrt{|\sin\theta|})\), \(\sigma_{\rm z}=26\oplus 90/(p_{\rm T}\sqrt{|\sin\theta|}^{3})\)
* The 'Annecy' layout and a silicon pixel layer at \(R=4\) cm ('Annecy + pixels') \(\sigma_{\rm IP}=18\oplus 61/(p_{\rm T}\sqrt{|\sin\theta|})\), \(\sigma_{\rm z}=84\oplus 130/(p_{\rm T}\sqrt{|\sin\theta|}^{3})\)

The resolutions are shown in Fig. 1 as a function of the pion transverse momentum cut. At pion transverse moment a of \(\geq 3\) GeV/\(c\), the dominant term in the resolution is the multiple scattering term (the second term) in all the other cases except for the \(z\)-resolution of the pixel layer. The resolutions are thus quite similar for all the strip variants of the vertex detector. Going up to transverse momenta of \(\geq 6\) GeV/\(c\), the asymptotic terms of the impact parameter resolution (the first terms) start dominating. The difference between the two 'Annecy' layout variants becomes more pronounced. The source of the difference is the asymptotic term of the \(z\)-resolution due to the rotation of the second pixel tracking layer. The difference between the strip and pixel layer resolutions increases due to the worse point resolution assumed for the pixel layer.

The analyses of the \({\rm B}_{\rm d}^{0}\rightarrow\pi^{+}\pi^{-}\) signal and backgrounds were performed by applying an impact parameter smearing according to the 'Panel' layout. For the transverse momentum cut of \(\geq 6\) GeV/\(c\) used in the analysis, the resolution was about 57 \(\mu\)m for the 'Panel' layout. The applied momentum smearing was \(\sigma(p_{\rm T})/p_{\rm T}=5\cdot 10^{-4}\oplus 1.2\%\). The mass resolution for \({\rm B}_{\rm d}^{0}\rightarrow\pi^{+}\pi^{-}\) was 50 MeV/\(c^{2}\) when requiring \(p_{\rm T}>6\) GeV/\(c\) for both the pions.

### Signal and background

Background to the signal \(\mathrm{B}^{0}_{\mathrm{d}}\rightarrow\pi^{+}\pi^{-}\) can be produced by:

* B-meson decays \(\mathrm{B}^{0}_{\mathrm{d}}\rightarrow\mathrm{K}^{+}\pi^{-}\), \(\mathrm{B}^{0}_{\mathrm{s}}\rightarrow\mathrm{K}^{-}\pi^{+}\), \(\mathrm{B}^{0}_{\mathrm{s}}\rightarrow\mathrm{K}^{-}\mathrm{K}^{+}\) (hadrons are not identified). Since the branching fractions of these channels have not been measured, it was assumed that the fractions were \(2\cdot 10^{-5}\) for the Cabibbo-allowed decay \(\mathrm{B}^{0}_{\mathrm{s}}\rightarrow\mathrm{K}^{-}\pi^{+}\), and \(1\cdot 10^{-5}\) for the Cabibbo-suppressed decays \(\mathrm{B}^{0}_{\mathrm{d}}\rightarrow\mathrm{K}^{+}\pi^{-}\) and \(\mathrm{B}^{0}_{\mathrm{s}}\rightarrow\mathrm{K}^{-}\mathrm{K}^{+}\). The mass difference between \(\mathrm{B}^{0}_{\mathrm{d}}\) and \(\mathrm{B}^{0}_{\mathrm{s}}\) was set to 100 MeV/c\({}^{2}\)[4]. B-meson production fractions were assumed to be 0.38 and 0.14 for \(\mathrm{B}^{0}_{\mathrm{d}}\) and \(\mathrm{B}^{0}_{\mathrm{s}}\), respectively.
* B-baryon decay \(\Lambda_{\mathrm{b}}\rightarrow\mathrm{p}\pi^{-}\). The branching fraction for this decay was assumed to be \(1\cdot 10^{-4}\)[5]. The \(\Lambda_{\mathrm{b}}\) production fraction was taken to be 0.10 and the mass was assumed to be 5.62 GeV/c\({}^{2}\).
* Three-body B- decays: \(\mathrm{B}^{0}_{\mathrm{d}}\rightarrow\rho^{\pm}\pi^{\mp}\rightarrow\pi^{\pm} \pi^{0}\pi^{\mp}\) and \(\mathrm{B}^{0}_{\mathrm{d}}\rightarrow\pi^{+}\pi^{-}\pi^{0}\). These branching fractions were each assumed to be \(5\cdot 10^{-5}\).
* Combinatorial background with both particles from the primary vertex (class 'primary +primary').
* Combinatorial background with one particle from a B-hadron decay and the other from the primary vertex (class 'B+primary').
* Combinatorial background with the two particles from two different B-hadron decays, or one from a B-hadron decay and the other from the decay of a long-lived particle \((\mathrm{K}^{0}_{\mathrm{S}},\Lambda)\) (class 'B+secondary').

The combinatorial background was studied by using a sample of 161,212 events generated with the PYTHIA Monte Carlo program [6]1. The event generation included all event classes (parameter MSEL=1), but only those events containing a b-quark with \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) at least above the trigger threshold were retained for hadronization. One of the b-quarks was forced to decay into a muon, and the event was finally accepted if the muon passed the trigger cuts \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>6\) GeV/c, \(|\eta|>1.6\). The corresponding cross-section was taken as 1.7 \(\mu\)b. Due to the limited statistics some factorization of cuts was needed in order to evaluate the background rejection factors. The background channels from exclusive B-decays listed above were simulated separately to study the rejection factor from the B-mass cut, but the efficiencies of the other cuts were taken to be the same as for the signal.

Footnote 1: Tape numbers LH1212-LH1216, LH1239-LH1243, LH1404-LH1413, LH0958-LH0961, LH0964-LH0965, LH0979-LH0982.

The signal was studied with a sample of generated events in which the other b-quark had been forced to decay semileptonically into a muon, and if the other b-quark in the event had formed a \(\mathrm{B}^{0}_{\mathrm{d}}\) meson, the meson had been forced to decay into a \(\pi^{+}\pi^{-}\) pair. Requiring that the muon fulfilled the trigger conditions \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>6\) GeV/c, \(|\eta|>1.6\), and both pions from the \(\mathrm{B}^{0}_{\mathrm{d}}\) decay had a \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) greater than 3 GeV/c and pseudorapidity between -2.5 and 2.5, 759 events were accepted2. The corresponding cross-section was 5.7 pb.

### Selection cuts and results of the time-independent analysis

To summarize the first and second level trigger requirements, events were accepted if the trigger muon had \(p_{\rm T}\) larger than 6 GeV/\(c\), and pseudorapidity in the range \(\pm 2.2^{3}\). Events were required to contain two oppositely-charged particles, with \(p_{\rm T}>6\) GeV/\(c\) and \(p_{\rm T}(B_{\rm d}^{0})>15\) GeV/\(c\). The overall lepton and charged-particle efficiencies (including trigger, reconstruction and identification efficiencies) were assumed to be 0.8 and 0.95, respectively. A mass pre-selection was made by requiring that the invariant mass of the pair was between 4 and 7 GeV/\(c^{2}\), in order to reduce the amount of background to be processed. The signal efficiency of the \(p_{\rm T}\) and mass cuts was \(0.32\pm 0.02\). The efficiency for the class 'B+primary' was \((121\pm 9)\cdot 10^{-5}\) and the efficiency for the class 'B+secondary' was \((50\pm 6)\cdot 10^{-5}\). Note that the signal and background efficiencies cannot be compared to each other due to the different requirements on the final state when writing events on tape. The efficiencies for the background do not correspond to the trigger efficiencies due to the mass cut, which is responsible for most of the rejection power.

The final event-selection criteria were based on the decay characteristics of a B-hadron. They were mainly aimed at reducing the combinatorial background, since the background from genuine B-decays behaves like the signal and the only effective cut to reduce the B-background is a mass cut.

The scaled impact parameters of the two particles \(f=|d|/\sigma_{d}\) were required to be greater than three. The impact parameter cut rejects the combinatorial background where at least one particle comes from the primary vertex. The acceptance for signal events was \(0.68\pm 0.05\), and the efficiency for the class 'B+secondary' was \(0.53\pm 0.08\). The efficiency for the class 'B+primary' was \(0.010\pm 0.007\). The large uncertainty comes from the poor simulation statistics (two events left). The distributions of the scaled impact parameters for these three classes are shown in Fig. 2. In principle, for a primary particle with \(d=0\), the probability to observe a fluctuation of more than three standard deviations is 0.0027. Using a value of 0.82 for the probability that a B-track has \(f=|d|/\sigma_{\rm d}\) greater than three, derived from the signal efficiency, the efficiency for the class 'B+primary' should be 0.0027 \(\times\) 0.82 = 0.0022. Loosening the \(p_{\rm T}\) cut for the pions to 3 GeV/\(c\) and removing the \(p_{\rm T}\) cut of the B, the efficiency of the impact parameter cut was \(0.0012\pm 0.0003\). Conservatively, the largest value of 0.01 was used when estimating the background. The background in which both particles come from the primary vertex should be negligible after the impact parameter cut, since the background efficiency should be \(0.0027^{2}=7\cdot 10^{-6}\).

The impact parameter is correlated with the decay time of the B, and therefore the impact parameter cut is effectively a life-time cut, thus improving the dilution factor \(D_{\rm int}\).

The angle between the reconstructed B-meson transverse momentum vector and the line joining the primary and the secondary vertices in the transverse plane was required to be less than \(6^{o}\). This cut kept all the signal events, while the efficiency for the class 'B+secondary' was \(0.14\pm 0.06\) (six events left). The efficiency for the class 'B+primary' was \(0.07\pm 0.02\), derived from a sample after the \(p_{\rm T}\) cuts but without the impact parameter cuts.

The decay length of the reconstructed B-meson in the transverse plane was required to be larger that 300 \(\mu\)m, and the distance of closest approach of the two tracks in space was required to be less than 55 \(\mu\)m. While the impact parameter cut was relatively inefficient for fake secondary vertices from the class 'B+secondary', these cuts efficiently reject the fake secondary vertices. The acceptance for signal events was \(0.86\pm 0.07\). The efficiency for the class 'B+secondary' was \(0.03\pm 0.02\) (two events left out of a sample with the impact parameter and angular cuts, but with looser cuts: 3 \(\mathrm{GeV}/c\) for the pions and no \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) cut for the B). The efficiency for the class 'B+primary' was estimated to be less than 0.07, since no events were left from the sample of 14 events with a loose \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) cut of 3 \(\mathrm{GeV}/c\) for the pions, no \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) cut of the B, and \(|d|/\sigma_{d}>3\). The distributions of the decay lengths are shown in Fig. 3, and the distribution of the distances of closest approach are shown in Fig. 4.

Finally, the reconstructed \(\pi^{+}\pi^{-}\) mass was required to be within one standard deviation of the nominal value (\(\pm 50\) MeV/\(c^{2}\)). This cut reduces the background coming from reflections from B-hadron two- or three-body decays, giving an acceptance for signal events of 0.68. Assuming a flat combinatorial background between 4 and 7 \(\mathrm{GeV}/c^{2}\) the efficiency for the background classes 'B+primary', 'B+secondary' was 0.03. The mass distributions for the signal and the different backgrounds are shown in Figs. 5 and 6 after all the cuts except for the final mass cut. The mass distributions for the combinatorial backgrounds have been smoothed by assuming a flat mass distribution, and then imposing appropriate Poisson fluctuations per mass bin.

The results for the time-integrated measurement of \(\sin 2\alpha\) are summarized in Table 1. Two-body B-meson decays form a major part of the background. Since these decays all peak within \(\pm 50\) MeV/\(c^{2}\) of the nominal \(\mathrm{B}^{0}_{\mathrm{d}}\) mass, when the kaons are misidentified as pions, they cannot be separated from the signal.

Charge-conjugated decays are included.

### Fit of the time-dependent asymmetry

Improved sensitivity can be obtained by making a time-dependent measurement of the asymmetry. The result, using a 1 ps cut on the proper time of the B decay and assuming a resolution of 57 \(\mu\)m on the radial position of the secondary vertex, is \(\delta(\sin 2\alpha)=0.043\).

Taking into account the penguin contribution in the time-dependent fit, the statistical error of \(\sin 2\alpha\) was 0.048 using fixed values \(A_{\rm P}/A_{\rm S}=0.2\) and \(\cos\delta=0\). The fitted asymmetry curve is shown in Fig. 7 with \(\sin 2\alpha=0.6\) as the generation parameter.

It is possible to fit the coefficients \(\Lambda_{\rm e}\) and \(\Lambda_{\rm s}\) of the \(\cos\Delta mt\) and \(\sin\Delta mt\) terms of the asymmetry, respectively, to eliminate the dependence on \(\delta\). The value of \(\alpha\) can then beobtained from the measured \(\Lambda_{\rm e}\) and \(\Lambda_{\rm s}=\Lambda_{\rm s}(A_{\rm P}/A_{\rm S},\alpha)\), given by

\[\Lambda_{\rm s} = -(\sin 2\alpha\pm\sqrt{(2\frac{A_{\rm P}}{A_{\rm S}}\sin\,\alpha)^{2}- (\Lambda_{\rm e})^{2}\cos 2\alpha}) \tag{8}\] \[\Lambda_{\rm e} = -2\frac{A_{\rm P}}{A_{\rm S}}\sin\,\delta\sin\,\alpha. \tag{9}\]

The statistical errors obtained from a two-parameter fit were \(\delta(\Lambda_{\rm s})(\mbox{stat.})=0.06\), \(\delta(\Lambda_{\rm e})(\mbox{stat.})=0.07\). The corresponding event sample was generated with \(A_{\rm P}/A_{\rm S}=0.2\). The result was insensitive to the variation of the values of \(\alpha\) and \(\delta\).

## 3. Systematic uncertainties

Theoretical uncertainties in the measurement of \(\sin 2\alpha\) using the \(\pi^{+}\pi^{-}\) decay mode are large due to the unknown contribution from penguin decay diagrams.

The value of \(\alpha\) can be obtained from the measured \(\Lambda_{\rm s}=\Lambda_{\rm s}(A_{\rm P}/A_{\rm S},\alpha)\). Even if one would assume that \(A_{\rm P}/A_{\rm S}\) were known without errors, there would be a two or four-fold ambiguity in the measurement of \(\alpha\) taking \(A_{\rm P}/A_{\rm S}=0.2\). This is shown in Fig. 8.

Additional systematic error comes from the uncertainty in \(A_{\rm P}/A_{\rm S}\). If \(A_{\rm P}/A_{\rm S}=0.2\pm 0.2\), the typical systematic uncertainty in \(\alpha\) is from \(\Delta\alpha\simeq 3^{\circ}\) to \(\Delta\alpha\simeq 8^{\circ}\), depending on the numerical values of \(\Lambda_{\rm e}\) and \(\Lambda_{\rm s}\). Extreme cases occur when \(\Lambda_{\rm s}\) is around \(\pm 1\), leading to uncertainties up to \(\Delta\alpha\simeq 35^{\circ}\). Figure 9 shows the relation between \(\Lambda_{\rm s}\) and \(\alpha\) when \(A_{\rm P}/A_{\rm S}=\rho=0.2\pm 0.1\), and Fig. 10 shows the same when \(A_{\rm P}/A_{\rm S}=\rho=0.2\pm 0.2\).

Systematic uncertainties from production asymmetry, tagging and mixing have been shown to be at the level of 1% in [7]. In the decay mode \(\pi^{+}\pi^{-}\), the background is dominated by other B decays. Systematic errors may arise from uncertainties in the branching fractions and background shapes of the mass distributions of these B decays, since it may be possible that not all these decays will have been observed by the start-up of LHC. Using the numbers of events from Table 1 and assuming a 20 % systematic uncertainty in the background estimate, one obtains \(\Delta D_{\rm back}/D_{\rm back}=0.10\). Here it is assumed that the CP asymmetry in the background is negligible.

Figure 8: \(\Lambda_{\rm s}\) as a function of the angle \(\alpha\). The figure in the right bottom corner shows the relation when \(A_{\rm P}/A_{\rm S}=\rho=0\) (no penguin contributions), whereas the other figures show the relation when \(A_{\rm P}/A_{\rm S}=\rho=0.2\), with varying \(\Lambda_{\rm e}\). \(\Lambda_{\rm s}\) and \(\Lambda_{\rm e}\) can be measured from the observed asymmetry.

Figure 10: \(\Lambda_{\rm s}\) as a function of the angle \(\alpha\), when \(A_{\rm P}/A_{\rm S}=\rho=0.2\pm 0.2\), with varying \(\Lambda_{\rm c}\).

## 4 Conclusions

The statistical precision of the measurement of \(\sin 2\alpha\) has been estimated to be about \(0.04-0.05\) using the decays \(\mathrm{B}_{\mathrm{d}}^{0}\to\pi^{+}\pi^{-}\) collected in ATLAS during one year of running LHC at the start-up luminosity. This result assumes that the decay \(\mathrm{B}_{\mathrm{d}}^{0}\to\pi^{+}\pi^{-}\) occurs exclusively according to the tree-level graph (i.e. no 'penguin' contribution). A signal-to-background ratio of about 1:1 is expected under the signal mass peak.

There are, however, large systematic uncertainties due to the unknown fraction of penguin decays. If the fraction of penguin-to-tree-level decays were 0.2, the statistical errors on the coefficients of the \(\sin\Delta mt\) and \(\cos\Delta mt\) terms of the time-dependent asymmetry would be \(\delta(\Lambda_{\mathrm{s}})(\mathrm{stat.})=0.06\), \(\delta(\Lambda_{\mathrm{e}})(\mathrm{stat.})=0.07\), respectively. The value of \(\alpha\) can be obtained from the measured \(\Lambda_{\mathrm{s}}\) and \(\Lambda_{\mathrm{e}}\), but there is a two or four-fold ambiguity. The uncertainty in the fraction of penguin decays increases the systematic error on \(\alpha\). Using an estimate of \(0.2\pm 0.2\) on the fraction of penguin-to-tree-level decays, the typical systematic uncertainty in \(\alpha\) would be from \(3^{\circ}\) to \(8^{\circ}\), in addition to the inherent ambiguities. In worst cases the systematic uncertainty in \(\alpha\) could be up to \(35^{\circ}\).

The experimental systematic uncertainty is dominated by the uncertainty of the branching fractions of the two-body \(\mathrm{B}\)-decays constituting the main part of the background. The systematic uncertainty on \(\sin 2\alpha\) from the background would be 0.1, assuming a 20% uncertainty in the overall level of the background. The systematic uncertainty quoted above would reduce to 0.06 assuming a systematic uncertainty of 10% for the background.

In spite of the large systematic uncertainties associated with the measurement of \(\sin 2\alpha\), it will be interesting to establish CP violation in the \(\mathrm{B}_{\mathrm{d}}^{0}\to\pi^{+}\pi^{-}\) channel, and a measurement of the asymmetry will constrain the CP violation parameters.
