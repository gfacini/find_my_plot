###### Abstract

The baseline design of the ATLAS Inner Tracking detector uses MSGC detectors for precision tracking in the forward direction. In a previous note, we made a direct cost comparison between the silicon and MSGC substrate options, using the post-Annecy baseline.

At the request of the Inner Detector Review Panel, we discuss in this note a first optimised silicon-based backup layout for the barrel and forward regions.

## 1 Introduction

This note results from a request from the Inner Detector Review Panel to present an optimised precision tracking layout for the forward tracking detector of Atlas, as a backup to the existing MSGC baseline design.

In meeting this request we first made a cost and performance comparison of the post-Annecy MSGC layout [1], using a direct replacement of the MSGC detectors with silicon detectors covering the same area. The results of that study are described elsewhere [2]. We then concentrated on the development of an optimised silicon-based layout for both the barrel and forward tracking regions. A first attempt is described in this note. After a discussion of the layout and its motivation, we compare the performance with that of the post-Annecy baseline design. We make a preliminary costing of this layout on the same basis as in Ref. [2], and we point out the effect on cost of performance changes, technology changes, and uncertainties such as the silicon substrate cost.

The proposed design has evolved slightly in reaction to comments and suggestions following the distribution of a draft version of this document, and we welcome technical criticisms of the layout.

## 2 The optimized barrel and forward tracking layout.

Figure 1 shows the proposed design of a silicon-based Inner Detector layout based on silicon detectors (pixel and stereo strips) for the precision tracking. The disposition of the forward wheels is shown in Table 1.

We note key elements of the basic layout below:

* The inner pixel barrel and wheel layers are unchanged, and from existing studies we believe that for a given radial location, these layers are well optimised.
* The radial extent of the barrel silicon is changed from \(30<R<60\) cm to \(30<R<54\) cm. This is motivated by the benefit of reducing the radial range of forward wheels to approximately 24 cm (four 6-cm silicon strip detectors). Its effect on momentum resolution and pattern recognition is small.

* The barrel length is reduced by one module of 12 cm to \(-76<z<+76\) cm, consistent with the radial reduction. A further length reduction is undesirable because of trigger and pattern recognition considerations in the barrel-forward overlap region. The resulting silicon coverage of the barrel detector is reduced from 38 m\({}^{2}\) to 32 m\({}^{2}\) (assuming single-sided silicon detectors arranged back-to-back in each module).
* Nominal full coverage is obtained in the forward direction using 8 wheels of silicon strip detectors in the radial range \(30<R<54\) cm. The associated silicon coverage is 20.2 m\({}^{2}\), compared with 25.2 m\({}^{2}\) for the post-Annecy MSGC layout (small wheels). The z-disposition of these wheels in Figure 1 is optimized to minimize the probability of \(<\)4 hit silicon strip layers. The price paid for this reduction of area is to reduce the minimal silicon radius from R=40 cm to R=30 cm. On the basis of results described in Section 4, the operating conditions are not significantly different from that of the barrel region. It is therefore logical that the barrel and forward regions should start at the same radius.
* In order to minimise the deterioration of pattern recognition in the barrel-forward overlap region, an 'ear' has been added to the first wheel in the radial range \(54<60\)cm [3].
* In an early version of this layout, adequate momentum resolution was maintained in the vicinity of \(|\eta|=2.5\) by the addition of a second "ear" directly preceding the calorimeter. Following suggestions from the Inner Detector Review Panel, we have replaced this ear by a 9th. wheel covering the radial range \(42<60\)cm, at z = 275cm. This gives significant advantages; in a region of limited continuous tracking, an extra pattern-recognition redundancy is maintained, and the specified momentum resolution requirements can be strictly maintained [4]. Further, this scheme allows the mechanical assembly of the forward precision units in a more modular way.
* To ensure pattern recognition capability in the region \(|\eta|>2.2\), three \(7.5\) cm-length GaAs wheels are foreseen in the radial range \(22.5<R<30\) cm. This covers \(1.49\)m\({}^{2}\), compared with \(2.26\)m\({}^{2}\) for the post-Annecy layout, and can use the same mechanical supports as for the silicon wheels.

Table 2 summarizes the number of modules and wafers for each type of wheel. As before, we assume single-sided silicon wafers, glued back-to-back with a single readout hybrid. Overlap and wastage due to the silicon substrate wafer size have again been taken into account. Table 3 summarizes the number of electronic channels per module and the number of ceramic hybrids expected to be used. In this note, we specify three possible readout pitches, and consequently two channel counts and subsequent performances. The choice of 384 channels per wafer (three 128-channel readout chips) provides a performance slightly superior to that expected from the post-Annecy layout. The choice of 512 channels per wafer (four 128-channel readout chips) approaches the performance of the barrel region, with only a reasonable cost increase. The choice of 640 channels per wafer exceeds the existing barrel performance. The quoted pitches assume variable-pitch detectors. Fixed-pitch detectors can also be produced, at pitches in the quoted range and with no dead regions, with an electronics overhead of a few % (depending on the chosen pitch). Costs will be quoted below, assuming 384, 512 and 640 readout channels per single side of each module (respectively 132-185, 99-138 and 80-110 \(\mu\)m pitch for a key-stone geometry).

## 3 Required R and D for a silicon-based precision forward detector.

Several features distinguish silicon detectors in a 'wheel' or 'disk' configuration from a 'barrel' configuration.

* Detectors used in a wheel configuration may have a variable readout pitch along any given strip of a detector. If so, the operation of these detectors needs to be checked. In practice, fixed-pitch detectors of the type planned for D0 [5] may be preferred. Detailed studies are required to choose the optimal pitch and stereo angle, and the relative advantages (pattern recognition) of key-stone and fixed-pitch solutions.
* The cutting to the required specifications of the silicon detectors in a non-rectangular configuration must be demonstrated.
* Since any given silicon strip readout covers a significant radial range, the depletion voltage will vary across the detector, and more particularly along the strip. Provided the full detector remains fully depleted, this should not be a problem, but it needs to be checked.

We expect that the detector requirements will be virtually identical to those of the barrel detector, and similarly for the electronics chain. We suggest that

* the ATLAS SCT detector subgroup is requested to design and demonstrate the operation of a detector satisfying ATLAS specifications, and to recommend an optimal detector design,
* the ATLAS radiation subgroup is requested to demonstrate the operation of a detector subject to radial variations of radiation damage,
* the existing ATLAS mechanics subgroup is requested to provide an initial engineering study of a possible support structure, as well as cooling services, and cable routings compatible with that already considered for ATLAS.

## 4 Radiation damage projections and ageing.

Extensive measurements with neutrons and charged particles have enabled a quantitative assessment of the expected radiation damage and the consequent operating conditions for silicon detectors. It is not a friendly operational environment; however, we do not expect operational conditions to be significantly worse in the region of the forward silicon detectors, than in the barrel region.

Figures 2 and 3 show the charged and neutral radiation damage, as evaluated by Gorfine [6] and normalized to the equivalent damage of 1 MeV neutrons. This evaluation is for no barrel moderator and a 10 cm end moderator, but it does not yet account for the latest forward calorimeter design [8]. Figure 4 shows the total damage and Figure 5 shows the associated depletion voltage of 300\(\mu\)m thick silicon detectors, after 10 years according to the'standard' LHC operational scenario [9]. It is evident from Figure 5 that the silicon operating conditions are a sensitive function of radius, but not of z at a fixed radius.

Performance of the Optimised Tracker Layout.

We compare the expected layout performance with that of the post-Annecy MSGC layout, and with the existing designed performance for the barrel silicon detector.

### Measured precision points, and momentum resolution.

The performance of this tracker layout is shown in Figure 6, where it is compared with that of the post-Annecy layout. If TRT points are not included, the performance deteriorates as shown in Figure 7.

* At least 6 precision hits are maintained throughout virtually the full \(|\eta|\) range, and the lack of precision points in the forward-barrel overlap region is virtually eliminated.
* The quoted momentum resolution assumes 4 'effective' TRT points of resolution \(\sigma=60~{}\mu m\). These TRT points dominate the momentum resolution and results of Figure 6 are insensitive to both the precision strip pitch and precision radial position.
* The stand-alone momentum resolution of the silicon tracker in the barrel region is slightly deteriorated because of the reduced outer radius of the detector. In both cases a point position resolution of \(\sigma=22~{}\mu\)m is assumed. This corresponds for analog readout to a strip pitch of approximately 110 \(\mu\)m, or in the case of binary readout to a strip pitch (pessimistically) of 75 \(\mu\)m.
* The identical position resolution is chosen in the above distributions for the forward direction. As in the post-Annecy layout the GaAs resolution was assumed to be \(\sigma=29~{}\mu\)m; in that layout a 35 \(\mu\)m resolution was assumed for the MSGC planes. As already noted, the TRT hits are expected to dominate the momentum resolution. The 512-channel option described here matches the barrel resolution well.
* With and without the inclusion of TRT points, the momentum resolution capabilities of this layout are almost identical to those of the post-Annecy layout.

### Detector occupancy.

Assuming 6.5 charged particles per unit of rapidity for minimum bias events, an operating luminosity of \(10^{34}cm^{-2}s^{-1}\), and a factor 2.5 in the number recorded hits [7] because of material and magnetic field effects, we estimate an average occupancy for minimum bias events as shown in Table 4. This estimate assumes 1 hit per traversed track in a given detector, and signal integration over 1 time bin. Existing electronics specifications require that the signal is collected in a single time bin; however, the above occupancies should be multiplied in general by a factor 3 (for the adjacent readout strips). Furthermore, to provide robust pattern recognition and momentum measurement, adjacent strips should not be occupied. Assuming an additional 1% noise contribution, this gives an effective 2.5% occupancy on inner layers, for minimum bias events.

There is a clear performance advantage in maintaining low detector occupancy; however a study of the realistic pattern recognition capabilities of this layout (or any other forward precision layout) is lacking.

Figure 6: Performance of the Optimised Layout (including TRT) and comparison with post-Annecy layout.

Figure 7: Performance of the Optimised Layout (excluding TRT) and comparison with post-Annecy layout.

### Robustness of the layout.

The performance of the tracker should not be catastrophically degraded by the loss of a layer. To examine the robustness of the layout each layer was turned off individually and the momentum resolutions examined. In Figure 8 the resolution with and without the TRT is shown for the most sensitive layer (the 3rd forward layer). Without the TRT there is only a narrow angular range in which the tracker performance is significantly degraded.

### Design changes to the barrel SCT and GaAs subsystems.

As already noted, this layout has a reduced precision-tracking radius and length in the barrel region. Further optimisation is likely. The motivation for this change was to maintain compatibility between the forward and barrel regions. The effect on performance is minimal. However, we note that radiation issues are a major concern. This results in a reduction of the substrate area from 38m\({}^{2}\) to 32m\({}^{2}\) (15%), and a reduction in the number of modules by 10%. This will realistically result in a cost reduction of approximately 10%.

The GaAs wheels of the post-Annecy layout have been replaced by three 7.5 cm-long wheels acting as extensions to the silicon wheels. This results in a substrate coverage of 1.49m\({}^{2}\), as compared with 2.26m\({}^{2}\) for the post-Annecy layout. Further, all GaAs detector modules are identical and the mechanics is a simple extension of the silicon wheels. In future layouts, the electronics and the detector pitch should be foreseen as identical to the silicon detectors. The reliable operation of these detectors is essential; however, given the small area involved, periodic replacement is forseeable.

## 6 Cost estimate of layout.

Table 5 summarizes our electronics cost estimate made on the same basis as above, using the case of on-chip digitisation. Cost variations about this price for binary or full analogue readout are discussed in Refs. [1] and [2].. Given the reduced radius, and the optimal configuration of silicon crystals, we assume that the barrel and forward granularity will be strictly matched. We have therefore costed the electronics seperately for 384, 512 and 640 readout channels per wafer

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|c||c||c|} \hline \multicolumn{3}{|c|}{**Detector occupancy**} \\ \multicolumn{3}{|c|}{**optimised layout, Version 1.**} \\ \hline Silicon & Radius (mm) & Occupancy assuming \\  & & 512 channels per wafer (\%) \\ \hline _Wheels 1–8_ & 300-420 & 0.47–0.50 \\  & 420-540 & 0.28–0.31 \\ \hline _Wheel 9_ & 420-540 & 0.31 \\  & 540-600 & 0.11 \\ \hline _Ear_ & 540-600 & 0.10 \\ \hline \end{tabular}

(double that per module). This includes a channel-independent electronics cost of approximately 1560 KCHF. The 384-channel case approximates most closely the post-Annecy layout. The full electronics cost varies between 3.0 MCHF and 4.1 MCHF, depending on the chosen granularity.

Table 6 summarizes the total cost of this detector layout, again on the same basis as that used in the comparison of MSGC and silicon options for the post-Annecy layout, and excluding the electronics. Since the barrel and forward silicon is now matched in pitch and detector technology, we have chosen a cost target of 600 SF per wafer for silicon detectors (single sided). This is not in contradiction with the number of 450 SF/wafer used in Ref.[2], which we in fact consider to be more appropriate for the 384-channel option of this layout.

The total cost, including an infrastructure of 1 MCHF that in practice may be shared with the barrel region, is shown for the various options in Table 7.

In addition to cost savings in the forward direction, cost savings can be expected in the barrel silicon sub-detectors, and the GaAs sub-detector. In the barrel region we would expect a cost saving approximately 10 % (3.6 MCHF) on the basis of the reduced number of modules to construct. The GaAs coverage is reduced by 40 %, implying a commensurate cost reduction (a reduction of >1.5 MCHF). Since at small radius, layer replacement is financially envisageable, we suggest that this is taken into account in future design optimizations.

## 7 Summary.

We have presented for discussion a first optimization of the barrel and forward regions using silicon substrates. We note that this design does not preclude the use of MSGC substrates of similar pitch and geometrical layout in the forward direction. This new layout offers substantial cost savings for the forward-backward precision tracking. It also offers cost savings for the barrel and GaAs subdetectors of the Inner Detector. The price paid for this is a reduction of the inner radius for the forward precision tracking detectors to R=30 cm.
