**LAr DETECTOR : QUALITY CONTROL**

**INTRODUCTION :**

_The old concept of quality control, with a hierarchical structure, with all drawings streaming up and controlled at higher and higher levels, is obsolete. In a complex project as ATLAS it is impossible to centralize and control all projects, drawings and informations without duplicating the work used to develop them._

_The responsabilities should be kept at the level of people who operate, still making sure that all aspects are covered._

_Internal drawings should be controlled internally, within the sub-unit. The number of generally diffused drawings should be kept at the reasonable level, including only drawing interfacing with other sub-units._

_Participation of everyone and "auto-control"._

_Work in the institutes should be transparent, if we have a document from each institute explaining their "modus vivendi", for example :_

traceability of data : history, validity status, where...

 numbering scheme of drawings

 disponibility of data : person responsible

 interfaces and binds clear

_The responsability should be clear, which institute, does what, who is responsible and so on. Although the rest of this document adresses more specifically the question of drawings, the present philosophy should not be limited to drawings but also applied to different items : cables and patch panels, kaptons, schedules,...._1.- QUESTION OF THE APPROVAL (mechanism).

Consider 4 loops :

a)Internal approval inside a LARG sub-unit.

_Is the drawing purely internal or not?_

_The circulation of the drawing should be either :_

_- decided by the sub-u convener along with the TC or better_

_- defined in a quality assurance document specifying the action to take for each class of documents_

_For internal drawings (no interface with any other activity, such as some tooling ), the approval inside the sub-unit is final and the drawing is ok for execution._

_Only the drawings interfacing with other pieces, detectors, cryostats, should go to loop b),to minimize the circulation of them._

b)Approval of the drawing inside other LARG sub-units.

_Each sub-unit convener receiving a drawing checks the compatibility with its own project, following in that the list of the necessary approvals described in the quality assurance document (Q-doc) and make sure that all people required to see the drawing have checked it._

_Decision, ok or not, is given to the convener of the sub-unit emitting the drawing, or to the person in charge as defined by the Q-doc attached to the drawing._

_If everything is ok, the drawing passes to loop c), if required by the Q-doc._

c)Approval of the drawing, technical and "physics".

_Sub-unit convener, TC, Cryo Project leader, LARG Project Leader give final approval as far as LARG is concerned., for drawings concerning more than a single LARG unit._

_If the drawing connects to the LARG exterior world (such as ATLAS dimensions, tiles connection or general services), it should be seen by the ATLAS Tech. Coord., after that proper consultations have been conducted with the other concerned projects. Otherwise the drawing is ok for execution._

d)Approval by the ATLAS Tech.Coord.

_Decision back to the LARG TC._2.- Question of the Approval (responsabilities)

Each drawing should be finally approved by a single person.

The responsability for a drawing should remain in the institute who created it. This institute should provide the start-up of the Q-doc attached to the drawing.

### LARG sub-unit convener :

_Responsible for the monitoring of the approval and the quality assurance of all drawings emitted in his sub-unit and of the internal compatibility of such drawings. Define the list of people inside the sub-unit who should check the drawing (Q-doc), in collaboration with the concerned institutes working on it. This list should be attached to the drawing as part of the Q-doc providing history, validity status, numbering, from which institute, as well all data judged necessary by him._

_Define (along with the TC) the interfaces to other sub-units and forward them the drawings. This list should be part of the Q-doc._

_Receive (or delegate this step to a person mentioned in the Q-doc) the approval or modifications from these other sub-units along with the list of people who checked the drawing, attached to the Q-doc._

_Monitors who should be contacted for any modification._

### TC, Cryo PL, LARG PL :

_TC, CRYO PL are responsibles for the final technical approval of drawings involving more than one LARG sub-unit. Help to resolve any conflict. LARG PL responsible for the "physics" approval._

_TC decides to contact for consultations other ATLAS detectors which are concerned by such a drawing to get their approval and afterwards forward it to ATLAS Tech.Coord._

_TC receives approval from ATLAS Tech.Coord._

## 3.- Question of the Classification (mechanism).

The numbering of drawings should be kept by Institute. The drawings will have a single numbering decided inside the Institute who emitted it.

However the drawings passed to the ATLAS Tech. Coord. will have a double numbering. The second number is decided by and is purely internal to the ATLAS Tech. Coord. and used for installation purposes.

_Each Institute writes a document explaining its numbering system, accesses, list of drawings in hands, person in charge of the gestion of the drawings at home, systems used to generate drawings, and so on._

_The proposed date for such documents is March 96._

_As this information is evolutive, an update is sent each time something relevant to this point is changed in the Institute._

_This information is sent to the sub-unit convener and to the TC who both keep a record of it._

_All drawings should be kept available._

_The class of the drawing (preliminary, final) should be indicated._

_Two drawings cannot have the same numbering._

_As much as possible drawing conventions should follow ATLAS directives._

## 4 Question of the Classification (responsability).

The responsability for a drawing remains in the institute who created it.

The overall coordination of the information concerning drawings inside a sub-unit is assured by the sub-unit convener.

One person in charge of drawing communications should be identified per each institute. He/her should follow general ATLAS and LARG directives. At each time he/her should know the status of all drawings in the institute.

Any drawing accepted at some level cannot be changed without further approval of the same level (internal, other sub-units, ATLAS).

SUMMARY OF RESPONSABILITY FOR SUB-UNIT CONVENERS AND TC, CRYO PL IN TERMS OF CLASSIFICATION AND INFORMATION : SUB-UNIT CONVENER :

get from each institute his "modus vivendi"

write for his sub-unit the Q-doc specifying the responsabilities, interfaces, responsabilities of the interfaces and organisation

make sure that drawings emitted by his sub-unit are available and can be traced back.

the minutes of the LARG meetings provide naturally a report on the activities of the sub-units

TC, PL's :

get from each sub-unit the documents specified above and check their unitarity

has the necessary information to direct calls from in/out LARG

make sure that all interfaces are covered

liaison with ATLAS Tech. Coord.

harmonisation and follow-up of the schedules
