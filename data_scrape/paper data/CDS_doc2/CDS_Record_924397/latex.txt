## 1. Introduction

Hadron collider experiments offer one of the best opportunities to test the gauge sector of the Standard Model (SM) of electroweak interactions by exploring the self interactions of vector gauge bosons. These interactions manifest themselves as a coupling of three or four gauge bosons, such as \(WWZ\), \(WW\gamma\) or \(WWZ\gamma\), \(WW\gamma\gamma\), referred to as triple or quartic gauge-boson couplings (TGC or QGC). Within the framework of the SM, the structure of the TGC and QGC is completely determined by the \(SU(2)_{L}\times U(1)_{Y}\) symmetry. A precise and direct measurement of TGC and QGC of the electroweak vector bosons can either additionally confirm the Standard Model or may indicate a new physics beyond the SM. In the latter case, the SM can be considered as the low energy limit of a more fundamental theory. Since the gauge boson self couplings have not yet been measured with good precision it is possible that signals for physics beyond the SM would appear in this sector through discovery of anomalous TGC or QGC.

Triple \(WWZ\) and \(WW\gamma\) couplings have already been measured at LEP2 and at the Tevatron. At LEP2 energies above the \(W\)-pair threshold, the TGC were analyzed using direct \(W\) pair production (\(e^{+}e^{-}\to W^{+}W^{-}\)) [1], and single \(W\) production (\(e^{+}e^{-}\to We\nu\)) [2]. However the single \(W\) production cross section is much smaller, so that at LEP the dominant information comes from \(W\) pair production. In \(p\overline{p}\) collisions at the Tevatron [3], the TGC were analyzed in \(W\gamma\), \(WZ\) and \(WW\) production. The most sensitive process was the \(W\gamma\). In general, all existing direct measurements agree with the SM predictions with a precision of \({\cal O}(10^{-1}-10^{-2})\) [4]. In the near future the LHC will be the primary source of vector-boson pairs with large invariant mass and high statistics. The LHC will have a large potential fortesting TGC because the sensitivity to the anomalous contributions are enhanced at high center-of-mass energies, particularly for \(\lambda\)-type TGC [5, 6].

This paper focuses on the prospects of measuring anomalous contributions to the \(WWZ\) and \(WW\gamma\) couplings through \(pp\to W^{+}W^{-}\to l^{+}\nu l^{-}\overline{\nu}\) production (where \(l\) denotes an electron or muon), at the LHC with the ATLAS detector. The analysis is optimized for low luminosity, \(10^{33}\) cm\({}^{-2}\)s\({}^{-1}\), of the LHC. Although the WW channel is less promising, since it has a large \(t\overline{t}\) background, it provides a complementary information to the study of the \(WZ\) and \(W\gamma\) channels [7] at the LHC. Ref. [8] addresses the prospects for measuring the neutral \(ZZZ\) and \(ZZ\gamma\) couplings in the \(ZZ\) channel, and neutral \(Z\gamma\gamma\) and \(Z\gamma Z\) couplings in \(Z\gamma\) channel, at the LHC with ATLAS.

## 2 \(Wwz\) and \(Ww\gamma\) Couplings

The leading order production mechanism of gauge boson pairs is \(q\bar{q}\) annihilation, \(q\bar{q}\to W^{+}W^{-}\). Gluon-gluon fusion process also contributes at \({\cal O}(\alpha_{s}^{2})\). However, even at LHC energies, the latter process contributes less than 15 %.

The set of Feynman diagrams which describe tree level hadronic production of \(W\) pairs in the SM is shown in Fig.1. The first two diagrams, \(t\)- and \(u\)-channel, describe the \(WW\) production via quark exchange, while the third, \(s\)-channel, diagram describes WW production via either a \(Z\) boson or a photon as the mediating particle. There are substantial cancellations between the \(t\)- or \(u\)- diagrams, which involve only couplings of bosons to fermions and the \(s\)- channel diagram which contains TGC. These cancellations are essential to make the SM diboson production processes unitary and renormalizable. In the SM, the strength of TGC couplings is obtained by applying the \(SU(2)_{L}\times U(1)_{Y}\) gauge symmetry. A small deviation of these couplings from their SM values violates the subtle cancellation among the tree contributions shown in Fig.1 and leads

to observable effects.

To test the agreement with the SM, one approach is to define "generic" parameters that describe \(WWZ\) and \(WW\gamma\) vertices for the most general gauge boson self-interactions. Effectively, this procedure replaces the \(s\)-channel diagram shown in Fig.1 with the diagram containing generalized coupling between the \(Z\) or \(\gamma\) and the \(W\)'s, as shown in Fig.2.

The Lorentz invariant effective Lagrangian for the gauge boson self-interactions contains fourteen dimensionless coupling parameters, seven of each for \(WWZ\) and \(WW\gamma\)[9]:

\[L_{WWV}/g_{WWV}=i\ g_{1}^{V}\ (W_{\mu\nu}^{\mu}W^{\mu}V^{\nu}-W_{\mu}^{ \dagger}V_{\nu}W^{\mu\nu})\] \[+\ i\ \kappa_{V}\ W_{\mu}^{\dagger}W_{\nu}V^{\mu\nu}+\ {i\ \lambda_{V}\over M_{W}^{ \dagger}}\ W_{\mu}^{\dagger}W_{\nu}^{\nu\lambda}\] \[-\ g_{4}^{V}\ W_{\mu}^{\dagger}W_{\nu}(\partial^{\mu}V^{\nu}\ +\ \partial^{\nu}V^{\mu})\] \[+\ g_{5}^{V}\ e^{\mu\nu\rho\sigma}(W_{\mu}^{\ \leftrightarrow}\ \partial_{\rho}\ W_{\nu})V_{\sigma}\] \[+\ i\ \tilde{\kappa}_{V}\ W_{\mu}^{\dagger}W_{\nu}\tilde{V}^{\mu \nu}+\ {i\ \lambda_{V}\over M_{W}^{\dagger}}\ W_{\lambda\mu}^{\dagger}W_{\nu}^{\mu} \tilde{V}^{\nu\lambda}.\]

Here \(V^{\mu}\) denotes either the photon or the Z field, \(W^{\mu}\) is the \(W^{-}\) field and the field tensors are given as \(W_{\mu\nu}\equiv\partial_{\mu}W_{\nu}-\partial_{\nu}W_{\mu}\), \(V_{\mu\nu}\equiv\partial_{\mu}V_{\nu}-\partial_{\nu}V_{\mu}\). (\(A\ \stackrel{{\leftrightarrow}}{{\partial_{\mu}}}B)=A(\partial_{\mu} B)-(\partial_{\mu}A)B\) and \(\tilde{V}^{\mu\nu}\equiv{1\over 2}\epsilon_{\mu\nu\rho\sigma}V^{\rho\sigma}\). The overall coupling constants \(g_{WWV}\) are defined to be \(g_{WW\gamma}\equiv-e\) and \(g_{WWZ}\equiv-e\cot\theta_{W}\), where \(\theta_{W}\) is the weak mixing angle and \(e\) is the positron charge. Fourteen independent coupling parameters are grouped according to their symmetries as C and P conserving couplings (\(g^{V},\kappa_{V},\lambda_{V}\)), C, P violating but CP conserving coupling (\(g^{V}_{5}\)), and C, P violating couplings(\(g^{V}_{4},\ \tilde{\kappa}_{V},\ \lambda_{V}\)). The assumption of C, P conservation and electromagnetic gauge invariance, for on shell photons, reduces the independent \(WWV\) couplings to five: \(g^{Z}_{1},\kappa_{Z},\lambda_{Z},\kappa_{\gamma},\lambda_{\gamma}\). In the SM at tree level one has \(g^{Z}_{1}=\kappa_{V}=1\) and \(\lambda_{V}=0\). The \(W\) magnetic dipole moment, \(\mu_{W}\), and the \(W\) electric quadrupole moment, \(q_{W}\), are expressed as \(\mu_{W}=e(1+\kappa_{\gamma}+\lambda_{\gamma})/2M_{W}\) and \(q_{W}=-e(\kappa_{\gamma}-\lambda_{\gamma})/M_{W}^{2}\). Following common convention in defining \(g^{Z}_{1}\) and \(\kappa_{V}\), the deviations from the Standard Model predictions are given by the anomalous couplings: \(\Delta g^{Z}_{1}\equiv g^{Z}_{1}-1\), \(\Delta\kappa_{Z}\equiv\kappa_{Z}-1\), \(\Delta\kappa_{\gamma}\equiv\kappa_{\gamma}-1\), \(\lambda_{Z}\) and \(\lambda_{\gamma}\). By introducing deviations of coupling parameters ("anomalous couplings') from those given by the SM, the previous Lagrangian in general describes the non-renormalizable and unitary violating interactions. In order to avoid unitarity violation, the anomalous couplings are

modified as form factors with a scale \(\Lambda\):

\[\lambda_{V}(\hat{s})=\tfrac{\lambda_{V}}{(1+8/\Lambda^{2})^{2}},\,\Delta\kappa_{V} (\hat{s})=\tfrac{\Delta\kappa_{V}}{(1+\delta/\Lambda^{2})^{2}},\,\text{and}\,\, \Delta g_{1}^{Z}(\hat{s})=\tfrac{\Delta g_{1}^{Z}}{(1+8/\Lambda^{2})^{2}}\]

Whereas \(W^{+}W^{-}\) production is sensitive to both \(WWZ\) and \(WW\gamma\) couplings, only the \(WWZ\) (\(WW\gamma\)) coupling can be tested in \(W^{\pm}Z\) (\(W^{\pm}\gamma\)) production. The studies which are sensitive to both the \(WWZ\) and \(WW\gamma\) couplings have customarily made assumptions about the relations between the \(WWZ\) and \(WW\gamma\) coupling parameters. This is accomplished by using two different schemes. In the "equal" couplings scheme (used at Tevatron), where \(Z\) and photon couple identically to the \(W\), \(g_{1}^{Z}\) is fixed at 1 (because \(g_{1}^{\gamma}=\)1 by electromagnetic invariance), leaving two free parameters: \(\Delta\kappa=\Delta\kappa_{\gamma}=\Delta\kappa_{Z}\) and \(\lambda=\lambda_{\gamma}=\lambda_{Z}\). In HISZ scheme [10], the couplings are formulated in a framework which explicitly respects \(SU(2)\times U(1)\) gauge invariance. This also reduces the number of independent parameters to only two, commonly taken to be \(\kappa_{\gamma}\) and \(\lambda_{\gamma}\). In this scheme the following relations hold:

\[\Delta g_{1}^{Z}=\tfrac{1}{2\,\cos^{2}\theta_{W}}\Delta\kappa_{\gamma},\,\,\, \Delta\kappa_{Z}=\tfrac{1}{2}(1-\tan^{2}\theta_{W})\Delta\kappa_{\gamma}\,\, \,\,\lambda_{Z}=\lambda_{\gamma}.\]

Anomalous couplings can be detected by their influence on the observables. In general, the inclusion of anomalous couplings at the \(WWZ\) and \(WW\gamma\) vertices yields enhancements in the \(W^{+}W^{-}\) cross-section, especially at the large values of the \(W\) boson transverse momentum. \(p_{T}(W)\), and at large values of the \(WW\) bosons invariant mass, \(M_{WW}\). Next-to-leading-order (NLO) calculations of hadronic \(W^{+}W^{-}\) production have shown that the \(\mathcal{O}(\alpha_{s})\) corrections are large in these same regions and thus it is important to include the \(\mathcal{O}(\alpha_{s})\) corrections when using hadronic production to probe the \(WWZ\) and \(WW\gamma\) vertices. Compared to other processes which are sensitive to the structure of the \(WWV\) vertices, \(W^{+}W^{-}\) production has an important advantage. The terms proportional to the anomalous coupling \(\Delta\kappa_{V}\) in the amplitude grow like \(\hat{s}/M_{W}^{2}\)[11] (where \(\hat{s}\) is the parton center-of-mass energy squared), whereas these terms increase only like \(\sqrt{\hat{s}}/M_{W}\) in \(WZ\) and \(W\gamma\) production. One therefore expects that \(WW\) production exhibits a stringent sensitivity to the coupling \(\Delta\kappa_{V}\) compared with \(WZ\) and \(W\gamma\) production.

The most stringent direct limits on the anomalous TGC parameters have been achieved by the LEP experiments. The 95% C.L. intervals [4] obtained by combining the results from the four LEP experiments (until the end of 1999, at center-of-mass energies up to 202 GeV) are:

\[-0.074<\Delta g_{1}^{Z}<+0.028\]

\[-0.13<\Delta\kappa_{\gamma}<+0.13\]

\[-0.089<\lambda_{\gamma}<+0.020.\]

The TGC parameters are related by \(\lambda_{\gamma}=\lambda_{Z}\) and \(\Delta\kappa_{Z}=\Delta g_{1}^{Z}-\Delta\kappa_{\gamma}\tan^{2}\theta_{W}\). In each case, the parameter listed was varied while the remaining are fixed to their SM value. Both statistical and systematic uncertainties are included.

## 3. Calculational Tools: WW Event Generators

The W boson is a massive particle and decays quickly into a pair of leptons (\(W\to e\nu_{e},\mu\nu_{\mu},\tau\nu_{\tau}\)) or into hadrons (\(W^{+}\to u\bar{d},c\bar{d},u\bar{s},c\bar{s}\)). Hence, WW production can manifest itself in three main topologies: first in which both \(W^{\prime}s\) decay hadronically, \(BR(W^{+}W^{-}\to jjj)=46.19\%\), second in which one \(W\) decays hadronically and the other leptonically, \(BR(W^{+}W^{-}\to jj\nu)=43.53\%\), and third in which both decay leptonically \(BR(W^{+}W^{-}\to l^{+}\nu l^{-}\overline{\nu})=10.26\%\)[12]. The decay modes in which one or both of the \(W\) bosons decay into hadrons are difficult to separate from the QCD background from both multijet and W+ jet production. The purely leptonic modes have quite low branching ratio and poorly known kinematics due to the presence of two neutrinos in the final state. The advantages of this modes come from the unique diboson signature (two high \(p_{T}\) leptons with opposite charge, and large missing transverse energy, \(E_{T}^{miss}\) arising from the neutrinos), and from relatively low background. One of the leptonic decay modes \(W\to\tau\nu_{\tau}\), is experimentally very challenging, and thus only the electron and muon channels are usually considered. The branching ratios for these two decay modes are: \(BR(W\to e\nu)=0.1072\) and \(BR(W\to\mu\nu)=0.1057\), while the branching ratio for \((W^{+}W^{-}\to l^{+}l^{-}\nu\overline{\nu},\ l=e,\mu)\) is 0.0453 [12]. The study presented here covers the purely leptonic channel: \(W^{+}W^{-}\to l^{+}l^{-}\nu\overline{\nu}\).

For simulation of \(W^{+}W^{-}\) production with subsequent decay into lepton pairs, several Monte Carlo programs are in common use. General purpose programs, such as PYTHIA [13], evaluate the matrix element at the leading order (LO) and use the parton shower approach to include higher order corrections. The numerical parton-level Monte Carlo programs, MCFM [14], DKS [15] and BHO [11] calculate diboson production with leptonic decays to next-to-leading order (NLO) in QCD. MC@NLO, [16] works like any other parton shower MC generator, but incorporates NLO QCD matrix elements into parton shower based on HERWIG. However, only DKS and BHO include anomalous triple gauge boson couplings. Consistency between DKS and BHO generators is at the \(3-4\) % level for \(WW\) production. Qualitative agreement is observed in the distribution shapes [17].

In this paper, the NLO diboson BHO generator (by Baur, Han and Ohnemus) [11] is used. Some important results are compared with MC@NLO 3.1 predictions. In the NLO diboson BHO generator the diagrams contributing to \({\cal O}(\alpha_{s})\) are the squared Born (LO) graphs, the interference of the Born with the virtual one-loop graphs, and the squared real emission graphs. The BHO generator employs the phase space slicing method and the calculation is performed in the narrow width approximation for the leptonically decaying gauge bosons. The Monte Carlo program generates the n-body final state events, for the Born and virtual contributions, and the n+1-body final state events for the real emission contributions. Non standard TGC are included. The spin correlations in the leptonic decays are included everywhere except in the virtual contributions.

We interfaced the BHO generator to PYTHIA 6.203, for the fragmentation of partons and hadronization, and ATLfast [18] for the fast detector simulation of the ATLAS experiment. The events produced by the BHO generator contain the leptonic decay products of \(WW\) bosons (the n-body final state), and at most one colored parton in the final state (the n+1body final state). For the events with a colored parton in the final state, the method of independent fragmentation [19] is used to produce the color-singlet particles which form the input for detector simulation. The standard parton shower approach cannot be applied to the events produced by the BHO generator, since this would double count regions of phase space. The structure functions and SM input parameters used in this numerical simulations are: CTEQ4M (NLO) for the factor scale \(Q^{2}=M_{W}\) and \(M_{W}\)=80.396, \(\alpha_{QED}(M_{Z})\)=1/128, \(\alpha_{s}(M_{W})\)=0.116, and \(\sin^{2}\theta_{W}\)=0.23.

The predictions of the BHO generator for the Born-level (or leading order) cross sections and NLO cross sections are given in Table 1. The results are presented for the inclusive cross section, \(\sigma^{inel}\), leptonic cross-section, \(\sigma^{l+l^{-}}\), the cross section for \(e^{+}e^{-}\) channel, \(\sigma^{e^{+}e^{-}}\), as well as for \(\sigma^{e^{+}e^{-}}\) with the kinematic cuts imposed by ATLAS trigger ( \(p_{T}^{l}>25\) GeV, \(|\,\eta^{l}\,|<2.5\) and \(p_{T}^{miss}>50\) GeV). For comparison the MC@NLO 3.1 cross-sections, obtained with the same p.d.f.s', are included. At the LHC energies, for WW production, the NLO corrections increase the SM inclusive cross-section by approximately factor of 1.3, and \(\sigma_{cuts}^{e^{+}e^{-}}\) by factor \(\approx 1.6\).

The effect of NLO QCD corrections on kinematic distributions is shown in Fig.3, comparing Born and NLO differential cross-sections as a function of transverse momentum of electrons, pseudorapidity of electrons, transverse momentum of \(e^{+}e^{-}\) pairs and azimuthal angle between leptons. The NLO QCD corrections, affect particularly the shape of the \(p_{T}(e)\) and \(p_{T}(e^{+}e^{-})\) distributions. For example, at \(p_{T}(e)\) = 500 GeV, the NLO QCD corrections increase the cross-section by a factor \(\approx 4\), whereas enhancement is only by a factor \(\approx 1.5\) at \(p_{T}(e)=100\) GeV. For the same values of \(p_{T}(e^{+}e^{-})\) these enhancement factors are 50 and 3 respectively. The large QCD corrections at high values of \(p_{T}(e)\) are caused by a collinear enhancement factor \(log^{2}[p_{T}^{W}/M_{W}]\), in the \(qg\to W^{+}W^{-}q\) partonic cross section (for the \(W\) transverse momenta much higher than \(M_{W}\)), and by the large \(qg\) luminosity at LHC energies [11, 20].

An important characteristic of the NLO QCD calculations is the radiation of additional hard partons. One of the observables sensitive to this effect is the total transverse momentum of the \(W\) pair, \(p_{T}(WW)\). At the Born level, the two W's balance each other in \(p_{T}\) while, at NLO this is no longer true, since parton recoils against the W pair and \(p_{T}(WW)\neq 0\). Figure 4 shows \(p_{T}(WW)\) distribution as obtained by BHO NLO code, MC@NLO and HER

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{l c c c c} \hline \hline Cross section (pb) & \(\sigma^{inel}\) & \(\sigma^{l+l^{-}}\) & \(\sigma^{e^{+}e^{-}}\) & \(\sigma^{e^{+}e^{-}}_{cuts}\) \\ \hline Born (BHO) & 90.5 & 4.1 & 1.02 & 0.12 \\ NLO (BHO) & 119.2 & 5.4 & 1.35 & 0.19 \\ MC@NLO & 116.3 & 5.3 & 1.32 & 0.20 \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}

WIG. The HERWIG distribution is normalized to MC@NLO cross-section. The MC@NLO interpolates MC and NLO results smoothly [16],and the shape of the MC@NLO curve is identical to that of the HERWIG in the low \(p_{T}(WW)\) region. At large \(p_{T}\) the MC@NLO prediction is harder with respect to LO calculations. The \(p_{T}(WW)\) distribution predicted by the BHO NLO code is softer with respect to MC@NLO.

The high \(p_{T}\) region, where NLO corrections are important, is the same region where the inclusion of anomalous couplings at the \(WWZ\) and \(WW\gamma\) vertices yields enhancements in the \(W^{+}W^{-}\) production cross-section. Therefore, in this region, the sensitivity to the anomalous TGC is decreased. When NLO corrections are included, a large fraction of the

(The following kinematic cuts, imposed by ATLAS trigger, are used: \(p_{T}^{e}>25\) GeV, \(|\,\eta^{e}\,|<2.5\) and \(p_{T}^{miss}>50\) GeV).

\(WW\) events will contain high \(p_{T}\) jets. The effects of the QCD corrections can be reduced by vetoing events with hard jets in the central rapidity region, i.e. by imposing a jet veto requirement and considering \(WW+0\,jet\) production only. Comparison of the NLO alone, the NLO with jet veto requirement, and the LO transverse momentum distributions of electrons is shown in Fig. 4. It is found that the jet veto requirement is effective in recovering the qualitative shape of the LO distributions.

## 4. Results

### Background Processes

The final state of the process \(W^{+}W^{-}\to l^{+}l^{-}\nu\overline{\nu}\), with \(l=e\) or \(\mu\), is characterized by two leptons with opposite charges and high transverse momenta, and by large missing transverse momenta, \(p_{T}^{miss}\), arising from the neutrinos. The jets from the hadronization of additional partons in the event, due to initial-state radiation, may be present. A number of processes lead to the same final state.

The principal background originates from the top quark pair production, \(t\overline{t}\), with \(t\to Wb\) and leptonic decay of both \(W\) bosons (\(t\overline{t}\to W^{+}W^{-}b\overline{b}\to l^{+}l^{-}p_{T}^{miss}b\overline{b}\)). This channel has basically the same kinematical characteristics as the WW channel. However, in addition to the WW signature, the energetic \(b\) jets are present.

Heavy diboson production, such as \(W^{\pm}Z\) (where both \(W\) and \(Z\) bosons decay leptonically), may also contribute to the background if one of the two like sign charged leptons is produced with rapidity outside the range covered by the detector. The \(t\overline{t}\) and \(W^{\pm}Z\) backgrounds contribute to \(l^{+}l^{-}p_{T}^{miss}\) production for all lepton flavor combinations \(l_{1,2}=e,\mu\). Background processes such as \(ZZ\), contribute only if one of the \(Z\) bosons decays into charged leptons, \(Z\to l^{+}l^{-}\), and the other into neutrinos \(Z\to\nu\bar{\nu}\).

Single vector boson production with \(p_{T}^{miss}\) erroneously measured, may also contribute to the background in the case \(Z\to e^{+}e^{-}\) or \(\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\). There is no direct source of missing transverse energy for this background (the contribution to \(p_{T}^{miss}\) typically comes from jets escaping detection), so that a cut at \(p_{T}^{miss}\) is effective in reducing contribution of single vector boson production.

Numerous other processes, such as: \(W+jets\) (with jets misidentified as electrons), \(Wt\), \(\overline{b}b\), \(\overline{c}c\), \(Wg\to t\overline{b}\), \(q\overline{q}\to t\overline{b}\), \(Wc\) or \(W\overline{b}b\), \(W\overline{c}c\), contribute to the background in the \(l^{+}l^{-}p_{T}^{miss}+X\) channel. Although the cross-section for \(W+jets\) process is very large, the rejection factor for jets misidentified as electrons is also large (\(10^{5}\)). The other quoted processes are negligible, or they can be significantly suppressed by imposing lepton isolation cuts.

Table 2 summarizes the main background processes and their LO and NLO cross sections. The inclusive cross sections and cross sections for leptonic \(l^{+}l^{-}(l=e\) or \(\mu\)) and \(e^{+}e^{-}\) channel are presented. The LO cross-sections for the background processes are obtained by using PYTHIA 6.203 MC with CTEQ5L structure functions. The NLO cross-section for \(t\overline{t}\) process is taken from [21], while NLO cross-sections for other background processes are calculated by using MC@NLO 3.1 generator with CTEQ4M structure functions. In the following, all kinematical distributions for the background processes obtained with PYTHIA MC are normalized to NLO cross-sections.

### Event Selection and Efficiency

In order to study \(W^{+}W^{-}\to l^{+}l^{-}\nu\bar{\nu}\) channel, certain basic cuts are imposed. This cuts reject the events with topology clearly distinct from the signal topology and ensure that only the

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{c c c c c c c c c c c} \hline \hline  & \multicolumn{2}{c}{\(W^{+}W^{-}\)} & \multicolumn{2}{c}{\(t\overline{t}\)} & \multicolumn{2}{c}{\(W^{\pm}Z\)} & \multicolumn{2}{c}{\(ZZ\)} & \multicolumn{2}{c}{\(Z\)} \\  & LO & NLO & LO & NLO & LO & NLO & LO & NLO & LO & NLO & NLO \\ \hline \(\sigma^{incl}\)(pb) & 84 & 110 & 614 & 833 & 26.1 & 49.4 & 11.1 & 15.5 & \(4.8\cdot 10^{4}\) & \(6.0\cdot 10^{4}\) \\ \(\sigma^{l^{+}l^{-}}\)(pb) & 4.1 & 5.4 & 30.3 & 41.1 & 0.39 & 0.70 & 0.32 & 0.42 & \(3.2\cdot 10^{3}\) & \(4.0\cdot 10^{3}\) \\ \(\sigma^{e^{+}e^{-}}\)(pb) & 1.02 & 1.35 & 7.57 & 10.28 & 0.097 & 0.18 & 0.16 & 0.21 & \(1.6\cdot 10^{3}\) & \(2.0\cdot 10^{3}\) \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 2: Summary of the LO and NLO cross sections for signal and main background processesmain background processes, discussed in previous section, are analyzed further. The basic cuts for WW analysis are:

\(\bullet\) exactly two isolated leptons, \(l=e\) or \(\mu\) with opposite charges, transverse momentum \(p_{T}^{l}>25\) GeV, and pseudorapidity \(|\,\eta\ |<2.5\).

\(\bullet\)\(p_{T}^{miss}>50\) GeV.

The cuts applied to the \(p_{T}^{l}\) and \(\eta\) of the isolated leptons are consistent with the ATLAS trigger system. The large cut on \(p_{T}^{miss}\) is chosen to reduce potential background arising from event pileup and processes in which particles outside the rapidity range covered by the detector, contribute to \(p_{T}^{miss}\).

The next cut is applied on the dilepton mass,

\(\bullet\)\(|\)\(M_{Z}-m(l^{+}l^{-})\)\(|\)\(>15\) GeV,

and is intended to reject events in which \(l^{+}l^{-}\) pair originates from a \(Z\) boson decay. This cut significantly decreases the contribution of \(ZZ\) and \(Z\) to background processes.

The effect of these three cuts in suppressing the main background processes is shown in Table 3, where efficiencies after each cut are summarized. The expected rates, for signal and main backgrounds, for the integrated luminosity of 30 fb\({}^{-1}\) are shown in Table 4. After these three cuts, the \(t\overline{t}\) background still dominates over the \(WW\) pair signal. However, the \(b\) quarks produced in the top quark decay lead to one or two energetic jets, and the jet veto can be used to suppress further the \(t\overline{t}\) events. (As an alternative to a jet veto, a cut on the

\end{table}
Table 3: Efficiencies for signal and main background processes after imposed cutsmagnitude of the vector sum of the \(p_{T}\) of hadrons, \({\bf p}_{T}(h)=-[{\bf p}_{T}(l_{1})+{\bf p}_{T}(l_{2})+{\bf p}_{T}^{miss}]\) which is independent of the jet definition, can be imposed). The jet veto, with jets defined via \(p_{T}^{jets}>10\) GeV and \(|\,\eta\;|<3\), leads to tolerable background.

Assuming that the same kinematical cuts lead to the same efficiencies for the \(\mu\mu\), \(\mu e\) and \(ee\) channels, approximately 7800 signal events are expected for an integrated luminosity of 30 fb\({}^{-1}\), with 11% background, thus giving \(S/B\approx 11\). Using a higher cut on jet's transverse momenta, \(p_{T}^{jets}>20\) GeV, that is more realistic in context of ATLAS trigger, deteriorates \(S/B\) ratio to \(\approx 2\). The latter \(S/B\) ratio can be further improved by using additional cuts on \(\cos\theta({\bf p}^{e^{+}},{\bf p}^{e^{-}})\) and \(\phi({\bf p}_{T}^{e^{+}},{\bf p}^{e^{-}})\), or cut on \(\Phi\) angle between transverse momentum of lepton pair and missing transverse momentum, \(\Phi({\bf p}_{T}^{e^{+},e^{-}},{\bf p}_{T}^{miss})\). Figure 6 shows differential cross section as a function of the angles \(\cos\theta({\bf p}^{e^{+}},{\bf p}^{e^{-}})\), \(\phi({\bf p}_{T}^{e^{+}},{\bf p}^{e^{-}})\) and \(\Phi({\bf p}_{T}^{e^{+},e^{-}},{\bf p}_{T}^{miss})\), for \(WW\) and \(t\bar{t}\) processes. The MC@NLO results are shown in the same figure for comparison. The cut on the \(\Phi\) angle is the strongest. According to BHO, at the Born level the angle \(\Phi\), between \(p_{T}^{e^{+}e^{-}}\) and \(p_{T}^{miss}\), is 180\({}^{0}\). At NLO this is not true any more, and this angle becomes very sensitive to the number of radiated jets. By imposing the jet veto, the \(\Phi\) angular distribution at the Born level is recovered. The MC@NLO generator produces more jets than BHO and predicts more realistic angular distribution. The cut,

\(\bullet\) Jet veto: \(p_{T}^{jet}>20\) GeV, \(|\,\eta\;|<3\) and \(\Phi({\bf p}_{T}^{e^{+}e^{-}},{\bf p}_{T}^{miss})>175^{0}\)

improves \(S/B\) ratio to 9, so that \(\approx 8600\) signal events are expected for an integrated luminosity of 30 fb\({}^{-1}\), with 11% background (Table 4, third row). MC@NLO predicts \(S/B\approx 5\) and 5069 signal events. This number of signal events is more realistic and will be used for further analysis. The transverse momentum distribution of electrons and transverse momentum distribution of \(e^{+}e^{-}\) pairs, after all imposed kinematical cuts, are shown in Fig.7, for \(WW\) and \(t\bar{t}\) production. For comparison, the MC@NLO results normalized to BHO cross-section, are also presented. Distribution shapes show a qualitative agreement.

### Experimental Signatures of Anomalous Couplings

The presence of anomalous couplings has several experimental signatures. The first is an increase in the total cross section which is illustrated in Fig. 8. In addition to the total cross section, the differential kinematical distributions are also sensitive to the presence of non SM couplings. Since the anomalous couplings contribute only in the \(s-\) channel, their effects are concentrated particularly in small rapidity regions and large transverse momenta of \(W\) bosons. Since the W and \(W^{+}W^{-}\) transverse momenta cannot be unambiguously reconstructed in the dilepton channels, alternatively the transverse momentum distributions of leptons or lepton pairs can be studied. Figure 7. shows the \(p_{T}\) distribution of electrons and \(p_{T}\) distribution of \(e^{+}e^{-}\) pairs, for SM and non SM TGC couplings.

In this note, the limits of the anomalous TGC couplings are evaluated by using a binned maximum likelihood method to compare the "experimental" distribu

\(p_{T}^{(e^{+}e^{-})}\)), to the Monte Carlo reference distributions which are a function of the TGC parameters. The "experimental" distribution, which corresponds to an ATLAS experiment, is constructed in the following way. A sample of 30 million SM events is generated with SM values of the TGC parameters using BHO generator interfaced with PYTHIA 6.203. The events are passed through the fast simulation of ATLAS detector. The number of events, which are generated with the same generator, is generated with the same generator and the same generator. The "experimental" distribution, which corresponds to an ATLAS experiment, is constructed in the following way.

Figure 8: Total Cross section as a function of anomalous couplings, \(\kappa\) and \(\lambda\), for the ”equal” couplings scheme (\(\Delta\kappa_{Z}=\Delta\kappa_{\gamma}\) and \(\lambda_{Z}=\lambda_{\gamma}\)) and \(\Lambda\)= 2 TeV.

Figure 7: Transverse momentum distributions (BHO and MC@NLO) of electrons and transverse momentum distributions of \(e^{+}e^{-}\) pairs (after imposed kinematical cuts) for: \(t\overline{t}\) production, SM \(WW\) (BHO and MC@NLO, normalized at BHO cross section), \(WW\) with TGC \(\Delta\kappa_{Z}=0.2\) and \(WW\) with TGC \(\lambda_{Z}=0.05\).

obtained after detector simulation and after all cuts applied, is normalized to the MC@NLO signal rate (5069 events), and afterwards to the number of events that corresponds to electron and muon final sate and the integrated luminosity of 30 fb\({}^{-1}\). The "experimental" distribution is obtained by sampling each bin according to a Poisson distribution with the mean given by the relevant bin content of the SM reference histogram. Afterwards, contributions of background processes, are added. Since most background processes can be removed by cuts imposed on the WW selection we considered only the \(t\overline{t}\) background. For \(t\overline{t}\) background Poisson fluctuations were not included.

The MC reference distributions, \(f(p_{T}|\Delta\kappa,\lambda)\equiv d\sigma(\Delta\kappa,\lambda)/dp_{T}+d \sigma_{bckg}/dp_{T}\), as a function of TGC couplings, are obtained by using the following parametrization of the differential cross-section as a function of two coupling parameters:

\[\frac{d\sigma(\Delta\kappa,\lambda)}{dp_{T}}=\frac{d\sigma_{SM}}{dp_{T}}+ \alpha_{0}\Delta\kappa+\alpha_{1}\lambda+\beta_{0}\Delta\kappa^{2}+\beta_{1} \lambda^{2}+\beta_{2}\Delta\kappa\lambda. \tag{1}\]

The coefficients \(\alpha_{i}\) and \(\beta_{i}\) are determined for each \(p_{T}\) bin by fitting this function to nine BHO Monte Carlo samples for the following combinations of two TGC parameter values: \((-\Delta\kappa,\lambda),\ (0,\lambda),\ (\Delta\kappa,\lambda),\ (-\Delta\kappa,0),\ (0,0),\ (\Delta\kappa,0),\ (-\Delta\kappa,-\lambda),\ (0,-\lambda),\ (\Delta\kappa,-\lambda)\). These values form \(3\times 3\) grid centered on the SM values of \((\Delta\kappa,\lambda)\)=(0,0). The size of the grid is chosen to be slightly larger than the expected 95% CL on the corresponding pair of couplings. With extracted coefficients \(\alpha_{i}\) and \(\beta_{i}\), we are able to predict the cross section in a given \(p_{T}\) bin for any pair \((\Delta\kappa,\lambda)\). The error of such a parametrization is evaluated by calculating the cross sections with the BHO generator at random points inside the grid and then comparing them with the the approximation, Eq.(1). The largest error of the approximation is found to be less than 2%. MC reference distributions are also multiplied by the factor corresponding to ratio of BHO and MC@NLO signal rates.

The observed number of events \((n_{i})\) in a particular \(p_{T}\) bin can be described in terms of the numbers of expected signal, \(L\cdot\epsilon\cdot\sigma_{i}\) and background \(b_{i}\) events using a Poisson distribution function:

\[P_{i}(n_{i})=\frac{e^{(-b_{i}+L\cdot\epsilon\cdot\sigma_{i})}(b_{i}+L\cdot \epsilon\cdot\sigma_{i})^{n_{i}}}{n_{i}!}. \tag{2}\]

where: \(L\) is the total integrated luminosity, \(\epsilon\) is the signal efficiency and \(\sigma_{i}\) is the signal cross section. The joint probability of all \(p_{T}\) bins, assuming that they are uncorrelated, is then:

\[P=\prod_{i=1}^{N_{max}}P_{i}, \tag{3}\]

where \(N_{max}\) is the number of \(p_{T}\) bins. The log likelihood function of this joint probability is defined as:

\[{\cal L}=-lnP=-\sum_{i=1}^{N_{i}}\left[n_{i}ln(b_{i}+L\cdot\epsilon\cdot \sigma_{i})-(b_{i}+L\cdot\epsilon\cdot\sigma_{i})\right] \tag{4}\]

where the constant term, \(-\sum ln((n_{i})!\) is omitted. The best set of parameters \(\Delta\kappa,\lambda,\) and their C.L. limits can be obtained by maximizing the likelihood function.

The limits for TGC parameters are derived for the cases where only one parameter of the \(WWZ\) or the \(WW\gamma\) couplings is varied from their SM values. By varying the parameters of \(WWZ\) or \(WW\gamma\) couplings separately it is possible to compare sensitivity limits for TGC parameters in \(WW\), \(WZ\) and \(W\gamma\) production.

Figs. 9-11 display sensitivity limits in the case when only parameters of \(WWZ\) couplings deviate from their SM values. The one parameter negative log likelihood curves are shown as a function of the \(\Delta\kappa_{Z}\), \(\lambda_{Z}\) (Fig. 9) and \(g_{1}^{Z}\) (Fig. 11 _left_). Contour curves in the \(\Delta\kappa_{Z}\), \(\lambda_{Z}\) and \(\Delta g_{Z}^{1}\), \(\Delta\kappa_{Z}\) plane that correspond to 68% and 95% C.L. are shown in Figs. 10 and 11(_right_) respectively. All sensitivity limits are obtained for the integrated luminosity of 30 fb \({}^{-1}\) and form factor scale, \(\Lambda\) =2 TeV. The numerical values of limits corresponding to 95% C.L. are summarized in Table 5. These limits are derived from the transverse momentum distribution of the electrons.

The systematic uncertainties associated with the sensitivity limits of the TGC parameters are also presented in Table 5. The following systematic effects are estimated: (1) background rate systematics is evaluated by varying the \(t\bar{t}\) background process in the 'experimental' data histograms for \(\pm\)50%; (2) parton density function systematics is evaluated by replacing the CTEQ4 p.d.f.'s, which have been used for all previous simulations, with the CTEQ3 series p.d.f.'s in the 'experimental' data histograms; (3) systematics arising from neglected higher orders is evaluated by varying the renormalization and factorization scales by a factor of 2 for the \(WW\) signal simulation; (4) detector related systematics is evaluated by simply turning off the detector smearing in the event generation software chain; (5) systematics arising from size of the grid and p.d.f.'s used for the MC reference distributions; (6) systematics related to the accuracy of the NLO code is estimated using MC@NLO \(p_{T}(e)\) distribution as 'experimental' data histogram. The dominant systematic effects are theoretical, with the parton density functions providing the largest contribution.

Fig. 12: The negative log likelihood curves (statistical contribution only) as a function of \(WW\gamma\) couplings \(\Delta\,\kappa_{\gamma}\) and \(\lambda_{\gamma}\), for the integrated luminosity of 30 fb \({}^{-1}\) and \(\Lambda\) =2 TeV.

The limits, in the case when only parameters of the \(WW\gamma\) couplings deviate from SM values, are shown in Figs. 12 and 13, and summarized in Table 5. Because of the smaller overall and photon fermion couplings, the limits for \(\Delta\kappa_{\gamma}\) and \(\lambda_{\gamma}\) are \(\approx 2\) times larger compared to the limits of \(WWZ\) couplings. In the "equal" couplings scheme the limits, presented in Table 5, are \(\approx 10\)-\(40\%\) smaller than those obtained in the case where only \(\Delta\kappa_{Z}\) and \(\lambda_{Z}\) deviate from the SM values. These results can be compared with the sensitivities expected in \(WZ\) and \(W\gamma\) channels at LHC. The higher (comparable) sensitivity of \(WW\) pair production to \(\Delta\kappa_{Z}\) (\(\Delta\kappa_{\gamma}\)) coupling compared to \(WZ\) (\(W\gamma\)) production can be traced to the high energy behavior of the terms proportional to \(\Delta\kappa_{V}\) in the helicity amplitudes [11]. As mentioned in the introduction these terms are proportional to \(\hat{s}/M_{W}^{2}\) in \(WW\) production whereas they grow only like \(\sqrt{\hat{s}}/M_{W}\) in \(WZ\), \(W\gamma\) production.

The limits that can be achieved for values of different integrated luminosity are presented in Table 6. These results should be taken with caution, because they have been derived simply by scaling the histograms obtained for low luminosity, and effects such as the pile-up have not been accounted for. Nevertheless, the results provide information of how an increase in luminosity will improve the sensitivity limits of TGC parameters. By increasing the integrated luminosity to 100 fb \({}^{-1}\), it is estimated that the sensitivity limits improve by \(\approx 40-60\%\) for the form factor scale chosen. The sensitivity limits for the \(\Delta\kappa_{Z}\) and \(\lambda_{Z}\) parameters are dominated by statistics for integrated luminosity up to at least 100 fb\({}^{-1}\), implying that C.L. will always be statistically limited at the LHC experiments. Sensitivity limits depend on the value chosen for the \(\Lambda\). In Table 6 the limits which can be achieved at the LHC with \(L=30\) fb\({}^{-1}\) and for the form factor scale \(\Lambda\) between 1 and 5 TeV are summarized. By increasing \(\Lambda\), one improves the sensitivity limits up to the value \(\Lambda=4\) TeV. For higher values of \(\Lambda\), the sensitivity limits depend only marginally on the form factor scale due to rapidly decreasing cross section at the LHC for parton center-of-mass energies in the multi-TeV region [22]. The improvement in the sensitivity with increasing \(\Lambda\) is a consequence of the additional events at large \(p_{T}(e)\) which are suppressed by the form factor if the scale \(\Lambda\) has smaller values.

## 5 Conclusions

Based on the BHO NLO generator interfaced with PYTHIA and fast simulation of ATLAS detector it is found that \(W^{+}W^{-}\) production at LHC provides an opportunity to probe the structure of the \(WWZ\) and \(WW\gamma\) vertices. For integrated luminosity of 30 fb\({}^{-1}\) and form factor scale \(\Lambda=\)2 TeV, \(WWZ\) couplings \(\Delta\kappa_{Z}\) and \(\lambda_{Z}\) can be measured with an accuracy of 0.03 to 0.07 with 95% C.L. Increase of integrated luminosity from 30 to 300 fb\({}^{-1}\), and form factor scale from 2 to 5 TeV, improves sensitivity limits by \(\approx 40-60\%\). Because of the larger coupling of the Z boson to quarks and to the W bosons, the \(W^{+}W^{-}\) production is more sensitive to \(WWZ\) couplings than to \(WW\gamma\) couplings. Consequently, the limits for \(\Delta\kappa_{\gamma}\) and \(\lambda_{\gamma}\) are \(\approx 2\) times larger compared to the limits of \(WWZ\) couplings. Comparison with limits obtained from \(WZ\) and \(W\gamma\) production shows that in spite of large \(t\overline{t}\) background and limited information available for the final state, the WW production can provide stringent
