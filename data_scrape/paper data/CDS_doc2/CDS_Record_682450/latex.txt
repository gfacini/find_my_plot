**Abstract**

The electron veto performance potential of the inner tracker is studied for the panel layout. It is shown that an electron identification performance of 99.8% is achievable. This background study is important for a Higgs search in the \(\gamma\gamma\)-channel in order to suppress background from Z \(\rightarrow\) ee decay to an acceptable level. The study is conducted with full simulation for single electrons and photons at high luminosity.

Higgs search in the \(\mathbf{H\to\gamma\gamma}\) channel

The decay \(\mathrm{H\to\gamma\gamma}\) is a rare decay mode with a branching ratio of \(\sim 1.5\times 10^{-3}\) and is considered the most promising channel for a Higgs search in the mass range of \(80\lesssim m_{H}\lesssim 130\) GeV [1].

However, the \(\gamma\gamma\) signature suffers from very large backgrounds coming from different processes where photons are radiated during the particle production and/or decay. In addition, events with photons faked by jets, \(\pi^{0}\)'s or electrons contribute to these backgrounds.

### The background from \(\mathbf{Z\to ee}\).

For Higgs boson masses close to \(\mathrm{m}_{Z}\), the background from \(\mathrm{Z\to ee}\) is very dangerous. This background is resonant and produced with a cross-section roughly 25 000 times larger than the \(\mathrm{H\to\gamma\gamma}\) signal.

If one wants to reduce this background to a level below 10% of the expected \(\mathrm{H\to\gamma\gamma}\) signal, a rejection factor of about 500 against each electron is needed. Expressed in other terms, this requires the inner detector to veto electron tracks facing an electromagnetic calorimeter shower with an efficiency of 99.8%.

Two classes of \(\mathrm{Z}\) leptonic decays have to be taken into account for the evaluation of the expected electron veto efficiency.

The first class consists of \(\mathrm{Z}\) radiative production and decays with one or two photons in the final state. A careful study of these decays, which included initial- and final-state photon radiation[2], has shown that these events produce final states for which the invariant mass distribution of the \(\gamma\gamma\) or \(\gamma e\) pairs, which satisfy the kinematic cuts for potential Higgs candidates in the \(\gamma\gamma\)-channel1, is no longer dangerous.

Footnote 1: For details on the signal reconstruction and the kinematic cuts involved, see [3].

If an electron veto efficiency of 99.8% is assumed, approximately equal contributions from \(\gamma\gamma\) (double radiative production/decay) and \(\gamma e\) pairs (single radiative production/decay and single external bremsstrahlung) are found and these non-resonant backgrounds are well below 5% of the irreducible \(\gamma\gamma\) continuum.

The contribution from \(\mathrm{Z\to ee}\) radiative decays corresponds to about five times the contribution from \(\mathrm{Z\to\mu\mu\gamma(\gamma)}\) decays.

The background from pure \(\mathrm{Z\to ee}\) decays consists of events where both electrons are misidentified as photons after undergoing a bremsstrahlung in the material of the inner detector. Since this background is resonant it is potentially more dangerous. The rejection procedure for this background source is the specific topic of this study.

Assuming an electron veto efficiency of 99.8%, the background from pure Z \(\rightarrow\) ee decay is reduced to the level of 10% of the H \(\rightarrow\)\(\gamma\gamma\) signal, as shown in figure 1. The figure illustrates the reconstructed Higgs mass at the Z mass peak, showing the two different kinds of background from radiative and pure Z \(\rightarrow\) ee decays after application of the electron veto procedure in the inner detector. Since the Z radiative decay background is smooth above 80 GeV, and much lower than the irreducible \(\gamma\gamma\) background, it can be neglected[2].

## 2 Study of e/\(\gamma\) separation with the panel layout of the inner tracker

Within the framework of this study the feasibility of a 99.8% electron veto efficiency with the inner tracker 'panel layout' (details on the layout are given below) is evaluated. The desired electron veto efficiency has to be achieved while maintaining the photon efficiency as high as possible. It is aimed to keep the photon efficiency loss due to the application of the electron veto algorithm below 10%.

### Detector simulation and event reconstruction

The standard ATLAS software (ATRECON [4], DICE [5], SLUG [6]) has been used to simulate the response of the detector and to reconstruct single particles and physics events. Relevant modifications of the standard routines are pointed out in the text where applicable.

#### 2.1.1 The input data

The study uses a data sample of 22486 electrons and 1000 photons generated at \(\mathrm{p_{t}}\)=40 GeV and \(\eta\)=0.3, which is in the barrel region of the inner detector. Only events for which a calorimeter shower above 25 GeV could be reconstructed, are used for the analysis.

The single particles were generated using GEANT, version 3.21 [7]. In the data production the Silicon detection efficiency per layer is included with 100%, the TRT is simulated with an average detection efficiency of \(\sim\) 92% per straw.

Since pile-up effects give additional hits over the whole detector, it enhances the probability to identify the electron, whereas identification of a photon is more difficult. Therefore, the study is done with single electrons, while the photon efficiency is evaluated at design luminosity in order to estimate it realistically.

It is assumed that at design luminosity 18 minimum bias events (mib) are produced per bunch crossing (every 25 ns). The occupancy levels of different detector subsystems are simulated by adding on average 36 mib events to the calorimeter reconstruction, 24 to the TRT and 18 to the precision layer (SITV) reconstruction. Minimum bias events produced by the event generator PYTHIA 5.7 have been used.

All data samples have been produced with the 'panel layout' for the inner tracker and a separate preshower detector for the liquid argon electromagnetic calorimeter2. The data tapes used for the analysis are listed in table 1.

Footnote 2: This layout combination is referred to as ‘stl_TP0’ in the tape production database [8].

#### 2.1.2 The 'panel layout' of the inner detector

The panel layout of the inner detector is very close to the inner tracker layout of the Technical Proposal, described in detail in [9]. A sketch of the panel layout is given in figure 2.

There is a total of six high-precision, high-granularity tracking layers in the inner part of the tracker of which the first is a pixel detector whereas the other five layers are built of strip detectors. In the outer part straw tubes supply a large number of continuous measurements with coarser granularity on the particle trajectories.

The characteristics of the precision layers in the barrel part of the panel layout can be found in table 2.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{l l l l l} \hline \hline Event type & tape & selected events & \(\eta\) & comment \\ \hline \hline single electrons & LH1696 & 2498 & 0.3 & E\({}_{kin}\geq\)100 MeV \\  & LH1697 & 2498 & 0.3 & ” \\  & LH1698 & 2500 & 0.3 & ” \\  & LH1733 & 4995 & 0.3 & ” \\  & LH1734 & 4999 & 0.3 & ” \\  & LH1735 & 4996 & 0.3 & ” \\ \hline single photons & LH1695 & 1000 & 0.3 & ” \\ \hline minimum bias & I06319 & 500 & -3. - 3. & produced with PYTHIA \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 1: List of data tapes from the ATLAS production database [8] used for the electron/photon separation study. The single particle tapes are produced with a KINE threshold of 100 MeV for all particles as compared to the standard threshold of 1 GeV for daughter particles and 10 GeV for mother particles. The KINE bank for a data tape holds the kinematic information of all produced particles, if they do exceed a user defined energy threshold at a given interaction vertex.

#### 2.1.3 Event topology

Our simulation has shown that on average, 14.7% of the photons convert while traversing the inner detector, and 81% of the electrons emit at least one bremsstrahlung photon above an energy threshold of 100 MeV on their way through the inner tracker. Figures 3 and 4 show the radial distribution of conversion and bremsstrahlung processes as extracted from the GEANT KINE bank. The material distribution of the discrete and continuous tracking devices as well as the beam pipe is clearly visible.

Electrons with an early energetic bremsstrahlung emission are the most difficult to identify. Figure 5 shows the probability for an electron with p\({}_{t}\)=40 GeV at \(\eta\)=0.3 to lose a certain fraction of its original energy into one or more bremsstrahlung photons before a certain radius. The open circles take into account all bremsstrahlung photons emitted up to the pixel layer (inclusive), whereas the full circles show the same up to the second Silicon strip layer (also inclusive).

The probability for the electron to lose more than 95% of its original \(p_{t}\) (\(\geq\) 38 GeV) before the third Silicon strip layer at 40 cm is 0.2-0.4%. About 0.15% of the electrons lose more than 95% of their energy already before the first Silicon strip layer (at r=20 cm). This indicates that the best achievable electron veto performance will saturate around 99.85%.

### The principle of the electron veto algorithm

For an energy deposition in the electromagnetic calorimeter which exceeds 25 GeV the algorithm has to decide if the electromagnetic energy deposition originated from an electron or from a photon. As a global principle, the algorithm assumes the original particle to be an electron and tries to prove this assumption. As soon as an event satisfies one electron criterion it is identified as electron. If an event does not satisfy at least one of the electron criteria it will be identified as photon.

In order to prove the electron assumption, information from the inner detector is used. First a search for one high-p\({}_{t}\) TRT electron track in a cone around the calorimeter \(\phi\) position is performed. If one, and only one such track is found, it is assumed that the energy deposition originated from an electron.

If the event topology inside this cone is too complicated to identify just one such track or if no such track is found, then a helix road starting from the calorimeter position point is extrapolated back to the vertex3. This road is searched for a crude track segment in the innermost precision layers, which matches the calorimeter point.

If such a track segment is found, the cluster is also labelled as an electron.

### The calorimeter pointer

The electromagnetic calorimeter description is implemented in DICE with three longitudinal compartments having equal segmentation of \(\Delta\eta\times\Delta\phi\simeq 0.025\times 0.025\). The design includes a separate preshower with a finer segmentation in \(\eta\) and a coarser one in \(\phi\), \(\Delta\eta\times\Delta\phi\simeq 0.003\times 0.1\). More details on the layout of the electromagnetic

The information is extracted from the production kinematics bank.

calorimeter can be found in [9].

#### 2.3.1 Extrapolation back to the vertex

The road pointing back to the vertex is obtained from calorimeter information. Standard routines from ATRECON are used for the extrapolation. These routines require a \(\phi\) and z starting position, the curvature of the track and the track direction in the rz-plane (polar angle).

The calorimeter \(\phi\)-position and the transverse calorimeter energy deposition E\({}_{t}\) together with the vertex at r = 0 constrain the road in the r\(\phi\)-plane. This vertex constraint is justifiable since the vertex spread in r is only a few microns.

The situation is more difficult in the rz-plane due to the vertex spread along the z axis with \(\sigma\) = \(\pm\)5.6 cm. Therefore, the calorimeter z-position is needed together with its shower direction measurement to define the search road in the rz-plane.

#### 2.3.2 Calorimeter reconstruction parameter choices

For the H \(\rightarrow\gamma\gamma\) search only electromagnetic calorimeter clusters with an energy exceeding a threshold of 25 GeV are accepted. Figure 6 illustrates the different event topologies which are relevant for the e/\(\gamma\) separation study.

A cluster size of 3 \(\times\) 7 (\(\eta\times\phi\)) around the cell with maximal energy deposition is chosen for the calorimeter signal reconstruction. This is in contrast to the cluster size of 3 \(\times\) 5 which is found optimal for reconstruction of unconverted photons[12]. However, due to the large amount of tracker material in front of the calorimeter, only 64% of all H \(\rightarrow\gamma\gamma\) events will have two unconverted photons.

For converted photons and electrons which emitted energetic bremsstrahlung at some small radius it is very important to sum the energies over a rather large \(\phi\)-range. In this way, the energy of both conversion partners (e\({}^{+}\), e\({}^{-}\)) as well as the soft electron with its bremsstrahlung photon(s) are collected in the same cluster. Due to the barycenter method used for shower impact point reconstruction, its position is almost independent of whether the electron emitted a hard bremsstrahlung in the tracker material or not, provided that the total (soft electron + photon) energy is used to measure the shower position. Therefore a wide \(\phi\) acceptance improves the energy and position resolution as well as the overall detection efficiency for these electrons and photons [10].

However, one pays for the wide \(\phi\) area with increased electronics noise and slightly worse resolution in the presence of pile-up. In addition, this cluster size choice makes the Z \(\rightarrow\) ee peak width narrower, since the overall probability to detect the full energy of both decay particles in their larger \(\phi\)-cluster becomes higher.

#### 2.3.3 The calorimeter accuracies

Since the calorimeter point is used as starting point for the track search road back to the vertex, it is important that the spatial position and the particle's energy are known as precisely as possible. In order to achieve resolutions which are very close to the best achievable values, several corrections have to be applied to the reconstructed quantities. The starting point is the output data of the standard ATRECON electromagnetic calorimeter reconstruction code which provides \(\phi\), \(\eta\), E and E\({}_{t}\) information.

#### 2.3.4 The calorimeter \(\eta\) measurement

The z-position and the corresponding \(\eta\) measurement are related through the following relations

\[z(R)=\frac{R}{tan\theta},\ \theta=2\cdot\tan^{-1}(e^{-\eta}). \tag{1}\]

At this stage the calorimeter position measurements were derived solely from the barycenter of an energy cluster containing 3 \(\times\) 7 cells. Therefore, the limited granularity of the calorimeter cells in \(\eta\) is still visible in the wide position resolution, shown in figure 7.a. The widening of the resolution due to limited cell granularity can be understood from figure 7.b which shows the z-position measured by the calorimeter versus the true z-position. The visible's-shape' response is a common

Figure 6: Illustration of different event topologies, relevant for the calorimeter cluster choice.

calorimeter granularity effect resulting in a systematic shift of the reconstructed position.

This systematic effect is corrected with the parametrization given in eq. 2[13], which depends on the particle impact position within a cell as well as on the overall \(\eta\)-position at which the correction has to be applied.

\[\eta_{corr}=p_{2}\cdot\tan^{-1}\left(\frac{\eta-[\eta]-p_{3}}{p_{1}}\right)+[ \eta]+0.5\]

\[\left.\begin{array}{rll}p_{1}&=&0.1296\\ p_{2}&=&0.3836\\ p_{3}&=&0.4979\end{array}\right\}\quad for\ \eta\ =\ 0.3 \tag{2}\]

Figure 8 illustrates the achievable correction level.

The granularity corrected calorimeter response shows an inclination of the correspondence between the calorimeter z-position and the true z-position. This rotation around z \(\simeq\) 42 cm originates from the fact, that the calorimeter measurement was assumed to be taken at a radius of 140 cm. In fact, the calorimeter position is effectively measured at a larger radius, already inside the calorimeter, since the shower position is obtained from the center of gravity of the electromagnetic shower4.

Figure 7: a) The calorimeter z-position resolution after center-of-gravity signal reconstruction in a 3 \(\times\) 7 (\(\eta\times\phi\)) energy summing window. b) The z-position measured with the calorimeter versus the true z-position.

The radial position of the center of gravity, \(R_{eff}\), is extracted from the simulated data using following equations (fig. 9):

\[\frac{R_{eff}-R}{z_{corr}-z_{calc}}=\frac{R_{eff}}{z_{vertex}}, \tag{3}\] \[z_{corr}\ =\ z_{calc}\ +\ (z_{calc}-\mu)\cdot\alpha,\] (4) \[R_{eff}\ =\ R\cdot\frac{z_{vertex}}{z_{vertex}-z_{corr}+\frac{z_{ corr}}{1+\alpha}+\frac{\mu\alpha}{1+\alpha}}, \tag{5}\]

where the parameters \(\mu\) and \(\alpha\) for eq. 4 are chosen such that the reconstructed z-position matches the true z-position from the production (figure 8). The effective calorimeter radius depends on the particle energy and on the \(\eta\) where the particle entered the calorimeter.

With this procedure, the effective radius of the calorimeter measurement is found to be at 163.7 cm. The z-position resolution after corrections is \(\simeq\) 1.6 mm. A comparison of the electromagnetic calorimeter resolutions for single electrons to the ones for photons with pile-up is given further below.

#### 2.3.5 The particle direction measurement

The calorimeter can provide a measurement of the particle direction \(\theta\) (polar angle) by combining the reconstructed \(\eta\) positions from various longitudinal compartments at different radii.

As discussed above, the large spread (\(\sigma\sim 5.6\) cm) of primary vertices along the z-axis results in a large uncertainty of the z-position where hits corresponding to a certain calorimeter energy deposition may be expected in the tracker layers. The use of the calorimeter direction measurement in z allows to reduce this uncertainty to a few centimeters as shown below.

Detailed simulation studies of the calorimeter direction measurement have shown that the polar angle can be reconstructed with an accuracy of \(30\) mrad\(/\sqrt{E}\), for showers of energy E [11]. In the absence of specific reconstruction code for this quantity, the true vertex position as known from simulation kinematic banks combined with the measured z-position provides an estimate of the polar angle \(\theta\). Realistic reconstruction also for this parameter is attempted by convoluting the estimated angle with the nominal \(\theta\)-resolution of \(30\) mrad\(/\sqrt{E}\).

In each tracking layer, a road of \(\pm 3\sigma\) around the expected z-position is used in order to minimize the sensitivity to possible systematic measurement effects not taken into account by this simple Gaussian smearing.

#### 2.3.6 The calorimeter \(\phi\) measurement

In most calorimeters, one has to apply a granularity correction also to the calorimeter \(\phi\)-information. However, the accordion geometry which the LAr calorimeter has implemented in its \(\phi\)-segmentation results in approximately equal signal sharing between cells, independently of the cell impact position. The remaining weak granularity effect in the \(\phi\)-information has not been corrected for.

For high-\(p_{t}\) particles the calorimeter \(\phi\)-measurement is not radius dependent. Therefore, no extrapolation of the \(\phi\)-measurement to the effective calorimeter radius is performed.

#### 2.3.7 The calorimeter energy measurement

As the detector simulation is done with a separate preshower design for the calorimeter, a good energy resolution can only be achieved if the energy which is deposited in the preshower detector is added to the energy found in the main compartments. This has the effect of influencing the position resolutions due to different segmentations of the preshower detector and the main calorimeter.

Table 3 shows the impact of the preshower information on all calorimeter resolutions. Clearly, the preshower energy has to be added to obtain the best energy resolution. Since the preshower segmentation in \(\phi\) is significantly coarser than for themain calorimeter, the position resolution is worse by roughly a factor of 2. Therefore, the preshower information is not used for the shower position reconstruction. This procedure only slightly worsens the \(\eta\) resolution.

In addition, an energy correction of \(\sim\) 5% is applied, accounting for the energy deposited outside the 3 \(\times\) 7 cluster.

#### 2.3.8 Final calorimeter parameters

The road used to extrapolate back to the vertex starts from the effective calorimeter radius of 163.7 cm as discussed above. Figure 10 shows the calorimeter resolutions for single electrons and for photons at design luminosity (on average 36 minimum bias events added per event). The energy resolution is slightly worse in the presence of pile-up. The particle deflection in the r\(\phi\)-plane due to the magnetic field is taken into account up to the end of the cryostat at r = 140 cm.

### The precision layer electron veto procedure

#### 2.4.1 Corridor widths around the calorimeter pointer

Within a corridor around the two helix curves pointing from the calorimeter to the interaction vertex, all six precision layers are searched for hits.5

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{l c c} \hline \hline resolution & without preshower & with preshower \\ \hline \(\sigma_{E}/E\) & 3.4\% & 1.8\% \\ \(\sigma_{\phi}/\sqrt{E}\) & 0.75 mrad & 1.6 mrad \\ \(\sigma_{z}/\sqrt{E}\) & 1.64 mm & 1.6 mm \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 3: Impact of the preshower energy deposition on the energy and on the position resolutions. The resolutions are given for particles with an energy of \(\sim\) 42 GeV (\(p_{\mathrm{r}}\) = 40 GeV at \(\eta\) = 0.3). The underlined resolutions correspond to the resolutions used for the analysis (see text).

The search for hits is performed separately in the r\(\phi\) and in the rz plane, with road widths defined separately for each layer and in r\(\phi\) and rz, offering the possibility to account for different pointer accuracies in r\(\phi\) and rz.

Figure 11 shows the distance of the Silicon hit nearest to the calorimeter pointer for the three first precision layers. The tails from electron events with bremsstrahlung are visible on one side of the r\(\phi\) distributions, with its importance increasing with r, as expected. The width of the distributions is defined by the calorimeter pointer accuracy.

The corridor width in z depends on the distance of the extrapolation to the calorimeter pointer, \(r_{calo}-r\). The precision layer z-measurements have to be within 3\(\sigma_{z}\) around the back-extrapolated calorimeter pointer, with \(\sigma_{z}\) given by

\[\sigma_{z}(r)=\sqrt{\sigma_{\eta}^{2}+(rcalo-r)^{2}\cdot\sigma_{\theta}^{2}}. \tag{6}\]

Here \(\sigma_{\eta}\) and \(\sigma_{\theta}\) denote the calorimeter resolutions discussed above. In this parametrization \(\sigma_{z}\) increases with decreasing r (the further away from the calorimeter \(\eta\)-measurement, the more important the direction uncertainty becomes). The

Figure 10: The left column shows the calorimeter position (\(\phi\) and \(\eta\)) and energy resolutions for single electrons. The right column shows the same for photons at design luminosity, overlaying the single photon events with an average of 36 minimum bias events.

choice of a \(\pm 3\sigma_{z}\) road width corresponds to \(\sim\pm 2\) cm. Figure 11 shows that this cut is not very tight. The z road width is not used to fine-tune the analysis, because the particle direction measurement is not obtained from full simulation6.

Footnote 6: The algorithm sensitivity to systematic measurement effects like non-Gaussian tails in the resolutions is thereby minimized.

Figure 11: Distance of the Silicon hit nearest to the calorimeter pointer. The left column shows the distributions in the r\(\phi\)-plane, whereas the right column presents the same for the rz-plane. The two top histograms show the situation for the pixel layer, the middle ones for the first Silicon strip layer and the lower two for the second Silicon strip layer.

The road width in \(\phi\) can be made much smaller than the one in z, since the pointer is more accurately known due to the justified use of the vertex constraint in r\(\phi\). The r\(\phi\) road width is therefore used as a tuning parameter for the electron veto procedure, being varied between 0.15 cm and 1 cm. Since electron events most difficult to reject with this algorithm are those which undergo a hard bremsstrahlung in the innermost tracker material, the possibility of increasing the r\(\phi\)-road with \(r\) is also studied and the dependence will be shown below.

#### 2.4.2 Sign of the charged particle

Of the two opposite curvature roads used to extrapolate from the calorimeter back to the vertexing layers, the one with the largest number of Silicon hits found within the corridor for all six layers is chosen.

#### 2.4.3 Finding a track segment

Electrons which emitted a hard bremsstrahlung photon early in their path through the tracker material, do have a sizeable deflection from their original r\(\phi\)-path already in the precision layers. Therefore, a wide corridor in r\(\phi\) is necessary to collect all hits also from those electrons which are already bent far away from their original path. However, this increases the number of photons which are misidentified as electrons, since the probability to collect random pile-up hits increases with the corridor width.

To avoid opening the r\(\phi\) road too much, in the study presented here, only the first three precision layers are used to find a track segment.

Even in the absence of pile-up, there can be more than one hit found per precision layer in a small corridor. This is due to \(\delta\)-electrons, charge sharing between adjacent strips and multiple scattering while the particle crosses the \(\sim 300~{}\mu m\) thick layers. To decide which hits belong to the track, the following facts are exploited:

* the track projection in the rz-plane is well approximated with a straight line, deviating slightly only at larger radii. This statement is also valid for electrons which emit one or more bremsstrahlung photons.
* in a first order approximation (for \(p_{t}\gtrsim 1\) GeV), tracks originating from the vertex form a straight line also in r\(\phi\).

For each projection, a straight track segment is therefore fitted to all possible combinations of hits. The calorimeter point is used in the fit with its Gaussian error, thus guiding the search for the real hit in a multiply hit layer. At least two precision layers must have a hit within the corridor, for the fit to be performed.

A standard least square fit is used. The resulting \(\chi^{2}\) of the fit is normalized to the number of input points (three or four). The hit combination with the best \(\chi^{2}\) is considered as the real track segment.

Figure 12 shows the normalized \(\chi^{2}\) distributions for the fits in the r\(\phi\)- and rz-plane. The \(\chi^{2}_{r\phi}\) distribution shows a long tail due to bremsstrahlung which softens the electron and results in hits which are further away from the calorimeter pointer position than expected. Therefore, the r\(\phi\)-fit information cannot be used as a track quality criterion.

The \(\chi^{2}_{z}\) distribution is wider than the one for r\(\phi\)-hits, due to the fact that the pixel elements are smaller in r\(\phi\) which enhances the probability that two adjacent pixels are hit.7

Footnote 7: Clustering of adjacent hits is done in r\(\phi\) which yields a more accurate r\(\phi\)-measurement than any of the single adjacent hits can provide. However, the error of these new measurements is not properly evaluated, since it is conservatively overestimated by assigning a new error \((\mathrm{width}_{1}\mathrm{+width}_{2})/\sqrt{12}\), which makes the \(\chi^{2}_{r\phi}\) artificially narrower for these points.

Since the pixel elements are four times as large in rz than in r\(\phi\), the probability to have an rz-hit in two adjacent pixels is smaller. Therefore, no clustering is done for the pixel rz-hits, leaving the \(\chi^{2}_{z}\) unmodified.

Figure 12: The \(\chi^{2}\) distributions for the straight line fit of two or three found Silicon hits in the rz- and r\(\phi\)-projection together with the corresponding calorimeter point for single electrons. There are long tails in the r\(\phi\)-plane, due to bremsstrahlung (see text).

However, the \(\chi_{z}^{2}\) is certainly usable as track quality estimator since the rz track segment is not sensitive to the occurance of bremsstrahlung. From the \(\chi_{z}^{2}\) distribution it was decided to accept fitted points with \(\chi_{z}^{2}<40\) as an rz track segment.

When used with realistic Silicon layer efficiencies (\(<100\%\)), this method gives a few events (34 out of 22486 events for \(\epsilon_{Si}=95\%\)) with unusually large \(\chi^{2}\), although an rz-hit was found in all three layers. In these events, in fact, a hit missing due to Silicon layer inefficiency is replaced by the nearest spurious hit in the same layer.

In order to recover most of these events, the following algorithm is used: if an event has a \(\chi_{z}^{2}>40\) and all three layers have one hit in z, the least square fit is repeated three times, leaving out one layer at a time. If one of the resulting \(\chi_{z}^{2}\) values is significantly smaller than the two others, it is assumed that the hit which was left out of the fit is an outlier and does not belong to the rz track segment. The \(\chi_{z}^{2}\) without the outlier hit is then considered as the final one for the event. With this method 29 of the 34 events which would otherwise be lost due to the track quality cut in z, are recovered.

#### 2.4.4 Electron identification criterion

The choice of the electron criterion is a compromise between the desired electron veto efficiency and an acceptable loss in the \(\gamma\)-efficiency.

An overall criterion to define an electron with the vertexing layers alone has been found from the study of the first three precision layers with single electrons and photons at design luminosity.

This criterion requires an electron event to have at least 2 out of 3 r\(\phi\)-hits and at least 2 out of 3 rz-hits and to have an rz track segment with a \(\chi^{2}\) better than 40,

\[\geq 2\cdot hits(r\phi)\oplus\geq 2\cdot hits(rz)\oplus\chi_{z}^{2}<40. \tag{7}\]

It is important to keep in mind, that a pixel hit is counted as both, an r\(\phi\)- and as an rz-hit, whereas the Silicon strip hits are either r\(\phi\)-hits or rz-hits. In particular, when considering realistic Silicon layer efficiencies, as discussed below, the loss of a pixel hit results in the loss of two precision measurements at the same time.

#### 2.4.5 Results based solely on Silicon tracker information

The efficiency of the Silicon electron veto criterion is studied for several Silicon layer efficiencies, \(\epsilon_{Si}=100\%\), 98% and 95%, and as a function of the r\(\phi\) road widths. A summary plot of the resulting efficiencies \(\epsilon_{e}\) and \(\epsilon_{\gamma}\) is shown in figure 13. More detailed results are given in table 4.

The results show that it is possible to achieve the desired electron veto performance even with a Silicon layer efficiency of 98% at the expense of \(\sim\) 10% photon loss. Yet, for a Silicon layer efficiency of 95% the required electron rejection cannot be provided with a rejection algorithm using only three out of the six available Silicon layers.

Figure 14 analyzes the relative contributions to the achieved electron veto efficiency. Starting from 100% electron veto efficiency, less than 0.1% of the electrons are lost for a 1 cm road in r\(\phi\) due to very hard bremsstrahlung in the beampipe and pixel layer. Even in the wide road of 1 cm, these few electrons cannot have the required minimal two hits in r\(\phi\). This number corresponds within the errors to the points shown earlier in figure 5. Decreasing the r\(\phi\)-corridor width increases the loss of detection efficiency for hits from electrons which emit an early energetic bremsstrahlung. This loss of \(\sim\)0.4% of the electron events corresponds also to the number expected from figure 5.

Simple probability calculations show that the achievable limit for the proposed

Figure 13: Electron veto efficiency \(\epsilon_{e}\) versus photon efficiency \(\epsilon_{\gamma}\) at design luminosity as a function of different r\(\phi\) road widths and Silicon layer efficiencies \(\epsilon_{Si}\). The lines indicate the performance targets of 99.8% electron veto efficiency and \(\sim\) 90% photon efficiency.

veto criterion lies at 99.88% for \(\epsilon_{Si}=98\%\) and at 99.28% for \(\epsilon_{Si}=95\%\).

Going from a Silicon layer efficiency of \(\epsilon_{Si}=100\%\) to a more realistic value of 98% for a wide r\(\phi\)-corridor, one would expect a decrease from 99.97% to 99.85% (and to 99.27% for \(\epsilon_{Si}=95\%\)). However, the achieved values lie slightly below the expected ones. This is due to the combined effect of bremsstrahlung and Silicon layer inefficiency.

This analysis makes it clear that the Silicon stand-alone electron veto algorithm is limited by its sensitivity to Silicon layer inefficiencies. In addition, electronics noise

The first column gives the corresponding r\(\phi\) road width for the first three precision layers (pixel, first strip layer, second strip layer). The results are presented for Silicon layer efficiencies \(\epsilon_{Si}=100\%,98\%\) and 95%. The numbers in brackets denote the number of misidentified events.

may in fact limit the photon efficiency more severely than pile-up if the noise occupancy is as high as \(\sim 1\%\). Therefore, a more robust approach has to be evaluated.

The photon efficiency \(\epsilon_{\gamma}\) does not critically depend on the road width in r\(\phi\), since most of the events do not satisfy the rigid quality cut for the rz track segment. For a medium sized r\(\phi\) road and \(\epsilon_{Si}=98\%\), 19% of the misidentified photon events in pile-up are photons which converted before or in the first Silicon strip layer (r = 20 cm).

Taking medium-sized road widths in r\(\phi\) (i.e. 0.2, 0.35, 0.5 cm) the achieved electron efficiency for \(\epsilon_{Si}=95\%\) is 98.98%, which is a factor 5 lower than the rejection goal. Therefore a complementary electron identification method would be useful.

This method has to provide only a moderate electron rejection power of about 80% which can be achieved by detecting all electrons with only minor bremsstrahlung losses. The remaining 20% which are presumably more delicate cases with early large bremsstrahlung losses, are left to be rejected by the powerful Silicon rejection procedure. Such a combination would allow to achieve the required electron rejection, even for Silicon layer efficiencies in the 90-95% range. However, this separate 80% electron veto efficiency has to be reached without sacrificing too many photons, since the photon efficiency is already at its limit of \(\sim\)90%.

### The TRT information

The TRT track information can be used to identify electron tracks within a restricted \(\phi\)-cone around the calorimeter pointer. Events with one and only one electron track candidate are identified as electrons. The Silicon veto procedure is applied to the remaining, more complicated events only.

#### 2.5.1 The TRT track finding

For track reconstruction in the TRT, the ATLAS standard routine XRECON is used. This routine searches for tracks with \(p_{t}>0.5\) GeV over the full TRT volume.

Since the pattern recognition program is quite CPU time consuming, the standard routine has been modified so that the track search is only conducted in a \(\phi\)-cone of \(\pm\) 0.9 rad around the calorimeter \(\phi\)-position. At least 50% of the hits on each track are required to belong to one track only.

#### 2.5.2 Track quality

The track quality is defined by the ratio of \(N_{hit}/N_{crossed}\), where \(N_{hit}\) is the number of fired straws on the track, while \(N_{crossed}\) denotes the number of straws crossed by the fitted track. The average hit detection efficiency lies around 92% for piontracks and is higher for electron tracks (\(\sim\) 96%) due to their higher probability for \(\delta\)-electron and transition radiation photon production.

Figure 15 compares the track quality of electrons and of tracks from photon conversions and pile-up tracks. The difference in the track quality of the found tracks is due to the effect that the algorithm finds many more short track segments for pile-up events than it does for single electrons. In addition, the hit detection efficiencies for electrons is higher than the one for pions.

Requiring a minimal track quality of \(>\) 0.9 is 99.3% efficient for electron tracks and 61.3% efficient for tracks from photon associated events in pile-up.

#### 2.5.3 Track \(p_{t}\)-distribution

Figure 16 shows the \(p_{t}\)-distribution of all tracks found inside a cone of \(\pm\) 0.9 rad around the calorimeter \(\phi\)-pointer. As expected, there are only a few high-\(p_{t}\) tracks found for the photon associated events in pile-up, originating mostly from photon conversions. The \(p_{t}\)-spectrum of pile-up tracks concentrates around low- \(p_{t}\) while the tracks from single electron events have significantly higher \(p_{t}\). A \(p_{t}\)-cut, requiring \(|p_{t}|\ >\) 9 GeV, yields a \(\gamma\)-efficiency of 1.7% and an electron efficiency of 90.3%.

Figure 15: The distribution of the ratio \(N_{hit}/N_{crossed}\) for TRT tracks is shown for a) single electrons which did not emit a bremsstrahlung (19%) and b) photon conversions and pile-up tracks at design luminosity. All tracks with \(p_{t}>\) 0.5 GeV found within a cone of \(\pm\) 0.9 rad around the calorimeter \(\phi\)-position contribute.

#### 2.5.4 Track distribution around the calorimeter \(\phi\)

Figure 17 compares the track distance \((\phi_{track}-\phi_{calo})\)-sign\({}_{track}\) from the calorimeter impact point in \(\phi\) as a function of the measured track momentum for single electrons and for photon associated tracks in pile-up. In order to identify pile-up tracks, one exploits the fact that the deflection of an electron softened by a bremsstrahlung emission has a distinct sign.

It is possible to distinguish electron tracks from pile-up tracks by constraining the maximal \(\phi\)-distance of a track from the calorimeter-\(\phi\) under track charge consideration, depending on the momentum of the found track. A step function 'wrapping' tightly the tracks from single electrons is used8. This cut is quite efficient, it keeps

Figure 16: The full line shows the momentum distribution for tracks found in the TRT when the vertex constraint is used, the dashed line shows the same without usage of the vertex constraint in the track fit. Plot a) shows single electron events. The average track momentum is less than 40 GeV, due to bremsstrahlung emitted by about 80% of all electrons traversing the inner detector. All found tracks with \(p_{t}\) exceeding 0.5 GeV are included. The small peak at low momentum originates from secondary tracks from bremsstrahlung and subsequent conversions. b) The momentum distribution for photon associated tracks in pile-up at design luminosity.

97.3% of the electrons whereas the efficiency for photon associated events in pile-up is only 8%.

The widening of the distance spectrum at lower \(p_{t}\) originates from different radii at which the bremsstrahlung occurred.

#### 2.5.5 Electron identification

The intrinsic transition radiation capability of the TRT can be used to separate electrons from pions which are a large fraction of the pile-up events. For electrons, the probability to produce a transition radiation hit (exceeding an energy deposition threshold of 5 keV per straw) along its track is significantly higher than for pions. Figure 18 shows this difference for single electrons and for photon conversions and pile-up tracks at design luminosity9.

Footnote 9: A bug in the present official simulation software gives a transition radiation yield which is a factor 2 too large. For this analysis this has been corrected for the single particle tapes. However, the minimum bias tape was not reproduced, resulting in an overestimation of the number of electrons which are present in the pile-up. This effect makes identification of a photon in pile-up more difficult (decreasing slightly the photon efficiency), but does not affect the electron veto efficiency.

The ratio \(N_{high}/N_{total}\), with \(N_{high}\) denoting the number of high threshold hits on

Figure 17: The distance between the track and the calorimeter pointer in \(\phi\) multiplied with the found track sign versus \(p_{t}\) is shown for single electrons in a) and for photon conversions with pile-up tracks at design luminosity in b). The line in figure a) illustrates the \(\phi\)-cut(\(p_{t}\)) around the electron tracks.

the track and \(N_{total}\) being the sum of high and low threshold hits on the track, is required such that the electron efficiency is kept at the standard 90%. 15.4% of the tracks from photon associated events in pile-up fulfill this criteria.

#### 2.5.6 Definition of an electron track

Table 5 summarizes the impact of the cuts using the TRT information as discussed above on single electrons and on photon events in pile-up.

An electron track is defined as a track which

* has a track quality \(N_{hit}/N_{crossed}\ >0.9\);
* has its first hit straw at the beginning of the TRT at r \(<\) 65 cm;
* stays within a narrow \(p_{t}\)-dependent cone at that side of the calorimeter \(\phi\) impact point which is allowed from a bremsstrahlung assumption, taking the charge of the found track into account;
* has a \(p_{t}\ >\) 5 GeV;
* has a transition radiation cluster probability of \(\frac{N_{high}}{N_{(high+low)}}>0.185\);
* lies in that half of the barrel where the calorimeter \(\eta\)-measurement is taken.

Figure 18: The fraction of transition radiation hits of the total number of fired straws along the particle trajectory is shown for single electrons (a) and for tracks from photon conversion and pile-up tracks at design luminosity (b).

Only one of the above cut parameters, the \(p_{t}\) threshold, is used as tuning parameter to keep the additional photon inefficiency as low as possible. Figure 19 shows the fraction of photons lost due to the TRT electron cut as a function of the minimal \(p_{t}\) required for an electron track. The optimal \(p_{t}\)-cut lies around 5 GeV. Above this threshold one of the two electron tracks from \(\gamma\)-conversion starts to be rejected, thus making the event look like a single high-\(p_{t}\) electron. Below \(\sim\)2 GeV the photon inefficiency is dominated by tracks originating from pile-up.

#### 2.5.7 The effect of the TRT algorithm

As outlined in section 2.2, the strategy is to count the number of electron tracks found in the TRT per event. If one and only one track fulfills the TRT electron requirements, the event is identified as an electron. Events with more than one track fulfilling the TRT electron requirements will in future be treated as potential conversion candidates. In the absence of a more sophisticated treatment of multi-electron tracks, events with zero or more than one TRT electron track are passed on to the Silicon algorithm for a closer examination.

Since the electron identification efficiency stays above 85% over the varied \(p_{t}\)-range, the aim to reject \(\gtrsim\) 80% of the electrons with the TRT-cut can be met. A \(p_{t}\)-cut at 5 GeV keeps the additional photon inefficiency at a reasonable level.

In conclusion, 87.5% of the electrons show exactly one TRT electron track and are thus rejected as electrons. This is achieved at the expense of an additional 4.2% of photons misidentified as electrons.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{l c c c} \hline \hline TRT track information & requirement & \(\epsilon_{e}\) & \(\epsilon_{\gamma}\) \\ \hline \hline track quality & \(>0.9\) & 99.3\% & 61.3\% \\ track start at begin of TRT & r \(<65\) cm & 98.2\% & 71.6\% \\ \((\phi_{track}-\phi_{calo})\cdot sign_{track}\) & \(<f_{step}(p_{t})\) & 97.3\% & 8\% \\ \(p_{t}\) & \(|p_{t}|\ >5\) GeV & 93.0\% & 3.2\% \\ TR electron identification & \(N_{high}/N_{total}>0.185\) & 90.2\% & 15.4\% \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 5: This table summarizes the relevance of each TRT information for single electrons and photon associated tracks in pile-up separately. The efficiencies are evaluated for each track information criterion alone, without taking any of the other criteria into account.

### The combined TRT and Silicon algorithm

From the comments made about the Silicon stand-alone algorithm, an overall improvement of the performance is expected when information from both subdetectors is combined.

A comparison of the performance of the Silicon stand-alone algorithm and the combined approach for a few different \(\tau\phi\)-road widths and several Silicon layer efficiencies is given in table 6 and in figure 20.

The results show that the goal of 99.8% electron veto efficiency can be reached for all three studied Silicon layer efficiencies at the expense of an additional photon inefficiency of \(\sim\)14% by applying the combined electron veto procedure. For example, for a Silicon layer efficiency of 95% the electron veto efficiency performance improves from 99.11% to 99.78% for a fixed photon efficiency of 86%. For the latter electron veto efficiency of 99.78%, the dangerous resonant background from Z \(\rightarrow\) ee will be reduced to about 10% of the H \(\rightarrow\)\(\gamma\gamma\) signal. For an electron veto efficiency of 99.11%, the background from Z \(\rightarrow\) ee decay would be almost twice as large as the Higgs photon decay signal itself.

For Silicon layer efficiencies exceeding 98%, the electron veto efficiency is reached using the Silicon stand-alone electron veto algorithm.

Table 7 compares the photon efficiencies for the best achievable electron veto efficiency for the two veto approaches and for three different Silicon layer efficiencies.

Please note the different scales for the two plots.

#### 2.6.1 Energy resolution of misidentified electrons

Due to the nature of misidentified electrons10 it is expected that the energy resolution of misidentified electrons is smeared out in comparison to the one of vetoed electrons. Depending on the size of this effect, fewer misidentified electrons will be accepted in the Higgs mass bin which consequently decreases the number of background events from \(\mathrm{Z}\rightarrow\mathrm{ee}\). The percentage of background events from \(\mathrm{Z}\rightarrow\mathrm{ee}\) relative to the photons accepted in the Higgs mass bin is estimated by using the photon efficiency after applying the electron veto procedure. In general, this photon efficiency differs from the 90% assumed in the original background calculations.

Footnote 10: As discussed above, most of the misidentified electrons for a Silicon layer efficiency of 100% are events with early hard bremsstrahlung.

Therefore, if the physics requirements demand that the background from \(\mathrm{Z}\rightarrow\mathrm{ee}\) shall be suppressed to about 10% of the \(\mathrm{H}\rightarrow\gamma\gamma\) signal, the electron veto requirement can be loosened to an extent defined by the effect of the energy resolution smearing for misidentified electrons together with the photon efficiency after application of the electron veto procedure.

Figure 21 shows the enlargement of the energy resolution for misidentified electrons for a Silicon layer efficiency of 100% and for different electron veto efficiencies. The electron veto efficiency is lowered by narrowing the r\(\phi\)-road. When the r\(\phi\)-road gets smaller, Silicon hits which have been inside the road before, cannot anymore be used to define a track segment. Therefore, electrons which are identified correctly using a wider road, are then missing hits in one or more layers. These newly misidentified electrons have been part of the energy resolution of the reference peak when they were still correctly vetoed. Therefore, the additionally misidentified events narrow the energy resolution of the misidentified electrons. The energy resolution

enlargement decreases with the electron veto efficiency, as illustrated in figure 21.

The enlargement varies from about 1.8 at higher electron veto efficiencies11 to a factor: of about 1.5 at very low electron efficiencies.

Footnote 11: Due to lack of statistics, the estimated point for 99.8% electron veto efficiency has a large error - only \(\sim\)50 events can be used to determine the width of the energy resolution there.

Looking at the energy resolution enlargement for 99.8% electron veto efficiency at a Silicon layer efficiency of 100%, recalculation of the electron events found in the accepted Higgs mass bin shows a background percentage of 6.8%, which is less than the 10% which have been aimed for.

However, the energy resolution enlargement and, as a consequence, the background percentage in the Higgs mass bin, is expected to depend on the Silicon layer efficiency and on the r\(\phi\)-road width.

A first qualitative look into these dependencies is given in table 8.

Horizontally, the Silicon layer efficiency is varied while vertically, the electron veto efficiency is varied by narrowing the width of the r\(\phi\)-road. The table illustrates to what extent the enlarged energy resolution modifies the percentage of background from Z \(\rightarrow\) ee which would be accepted in the Higgs mass bin, taking into account the modified electron and photon efficiencies.

Figure 21: The enlargement of the energy resolution for misidentified electrons relative to the width of the correctly vetoed electrons versus the electron veto efficiency is plotted. All values are given for 100% Silicon layer efficiency.

For an electron veto efficiency of \(\sim\)99.8% the energy resolution smearing becomes less important with decreasing Silicon layer efficiency. This is due to hits missing in one or more Silicon layers as a consequence of the detection inefficiency. Therefore, the decrease in the energy resolution smearing can be explained with the same arguments as given above for the narrowing of the r\(\phi\)-road.

For smaller electron veto efficiencies, the r\(\phi\)-road width seems to dominate the Silicon layer inefficiency which results in a constant enlargement factor for veto efficiencies much smaller than 99.8%.

From this preliminary study it is seen that the effect of the energy resolution enlargement is not negligible and that its size depends on the Silicon layer efficiency and on the r\(\phi\)-road width. However, a more complete study containing more statistics and fully simulated Z events is necessary to understand all contributions and consequences of this energy enlargement effect.

Summary and conclusions

The detection of a Standard Model Higgs boson with a mass near the Z mass demands an electron veto efficiency of 99.8%, while keeping the photon efficiency as high as possible at high luminosities.

The study in this note shows that the desired goal can be achieved in the barrel part of the panel layout of the ATLAS inner tracker using a rather simple algorithm. In particular,

* for a Silicon layer efficiency of 98%, the desired electron veto efficiency can be obtained with the information from the first three Silicon precision layers alone.
* for a Silicon layer efficiency of 95%, this goal cannot be reached with the stand-alone Silicon electron veto algorithm. The loss of rejection power can be compensated by using additional information from the TRT.

Several points are left to be investigated in order to complete the study of background from Z decays for the Higgs search in the H \(\rightarrow\gamma\gamma\) channel. In particular, it would be interesting to

* run the analysis on electrons with pileup, verifying that this does not influence the electron veto-efficiency;
* account for electronic noise in the precision detectors and study its influence on the e/\(\gamma\)-separation performance;
* use the current layout of the inner tracker and check the impact of the presence of two pixel layers and stereo strips on the electron veto efficiency;
* extend the analysis to the inner detector endcaps where the material is up to three times as large as in the barrel.

Further improvements of the e/\(\gamma\)-separation performance may be achieved with the Silicon stand-alone algorithm by using the information of all six layers at least in z, as combinatorial hit correlations between six layers are less sensitive to single Silicon layer inefficiencies. More sophisticated studies can also envisage to use the pattern recognition capability of the TRT to resolve more complex event topologies, in particular photon conversions. Track matching between subdetectors will certainly strengthen the algorithm.

These possible improvements may provide a safety margin for the real experimental situation which might be considerably more complicated than anticipated in the simulation environment.
