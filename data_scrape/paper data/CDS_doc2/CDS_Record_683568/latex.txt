In this note it is described essentially the procedure used to insert the fibers in the Tilecal barrel module zero.

## 2 Fiber insertion procedure

The procedure of insertion of the fibers in the calorimeter consists of several steps:

* preparation of the module (paint cell boundaries, label cells, labell PMT holes, in stall (aspirin) bundle tubes, install fiber separator, install rulers, install rail)
* cut the fibers and organize fiber stock
* prepare additional pieces small profiles to protect fibers, aluminium and paper clips
* insert fibers, keeping them vertical
* check correction of fiber position, cell by cell, using lamp
* make the bundles of fibers
* adjust fiber ends inside the bundle tubes, use dummy fibers to finish bundles, and hold fibers tight
* glue the fibers

### Preparation of the module

The module is installed in the vertical position, with the girder in the bottom. The supports for the module are iron blocks, with a total height of about 80 cm. The boundaries of each cell are painted in the module, and the cells are labelled. The PMT holes are also labelled. Unused holes should be closed to avoid that dust generated during fibers bundle polishing spreads on the fibers surface. The bundle tubes and bundle rings are inserted in the girder rings. Small diameter (8 mm) bundle tubes and rings are used for B9and A cells, and 11.5 mm diameter tubes and rings are used for BC and D cells. The plastic combs (rulers, see description below) are carefully aligned in such a way that each hole of the ruler is aligned with the respective inter-master groove, and glued to the girder using contact glue (neopren). The fiber separator (see description bellow) is installed in the side of the module to be filled with fibers.

### Preparation of the fibers

From the table of number of fibers and respective lengths per cell, the fibers are cut with the correct length using a paper cutter, and stored in plates grouped in bundles. Each bundle is labelled with the respective length, number of fibers and cell.

### Tiles, fibers and module

The tiles are wrapped in Tyvek, and the fibers read the tiles at both sides under an aluminized mylar cover. The mylar covers are glued to the Tyvek with double side scotch tape, and during the procedure of glueing the aluminized mylar to the Tyvek, a metalic 1 mm diameter fake fiber is used to shape the mylar. The aluminized mylar is very thin and has some elasticity, resulting in different tile-fiber coupling from tile to tile: in some of them the fiber will be very tight and in other ones the fiber will be loose.

The fibers are aluminized in one of the extremities. The other end was just cut by a paper cutter. The aluminium is protected by a polymer, resulting in a diameter larger than 1 mm in the last centimeter of the fiber.

The module is in vertical position, the girder in the bottom, so the fibers are inserted in the vertical, going downwards, to avoid damage of the aluminized end, and because in some of the tiles with tight aluminized mylar covers, the fiber with the polymer that protects the aluminium would not go through if inserted upwards.

### Insertion sequence

The insertion sequence is from bottom to top, because top fibers run above bottom fibers. The order of insertion is sampling D first, then C and B, and A is the last sampling to be inserted.

### Fiber protection: the small profiles

For each half-period, during the insertion of the C fibers, 1.5cm long profiles are inserted on top of the D fibers, at the bottom end of the iron grooves in between adjacent masters, to avoid fiber damage in contact with the sharp edges of the masters. The D fibers run under the profile, the C fibers in the central hole, the A fibers in the hole that is in the direction of the center of the module, and the B fibers in the other hole. The position of the small profiles has to be carefully adjusted when inserting the fibers, because those profiles can slide up or down, moving away from the position in which they are intended to protect the fibers.

### Comb

A comb is intended to be used to separate the fibers in a well defined sequence where they get out to the girder region. Due to lack of time, in the module zero the comb was replaced by a ruler with 4 holes per half period. The ruler is glued to the sub-modules (one ruler per sub-module), in the bottom, at a few milimiters of distance of the girder. The order of the fibers in the ruler, in the direction from center of the module to the outside is.

### Fiber separator

The fiber separator is a structure to keep the fibers of each sampling in a separated position, allowing an easy detection of insertion errors and a fast bundle making procedure. It consists of 2 supporting bars placed in the extremities of the region to instrument (one in the end of the module and the other near the center when inserting fibers in half module), located only a few centimeters higher than the bottom of the girder. The bars hold to the girder using clamps, and are perpendicular to the module. A set of wires run from one bar to the other, spaced by about 2 cm. The wires should be soft and free of grease because the fibers will be in contact with them. The nearest to the girder avoids the contact of the fibers with the girder.

The fibers are kept in the vertical, and after the insertion of each fiber, the free bottom end of the fiber is positioned in the corresponding place in the fiber separator, in a sequence defined by the sampling to which the fiber belongs. The sequence, from the girder to the outside, is, in such away that, in general, the fibers with shorter free lengths (length measured from the end of the masters to the PMT) are more inside and the fibers with larger free lengths are outside.

### Keeping the fibers in place

After insertion of each fiber of sampling A, the path of the fibers in between adjacent master plates is adjusted as well as possible, and the fibers are kept in place using thick paper clips. The paper clips can be inserted only in the positions where there are tiles, surrounding the fibers and entering at both sides of the tile in the narrow space in between tile and masters.

It was found that the paper clips and the small profiles were not enough to keep the fibers in place, so extra pieces of thicker paper were cut larger than the distance inter masters, and inserted with pressure in between masters, forcing the fibers to be in place.

This last solution has some drawbacks. First of all, if the papers are pressed very strongly against the iron/tile, the fibers that are in between paper and iron/tile will be damaged. In some cases, due to roughness of the surface of the iron spacers, the fibers will be damaged even with a small pressure. If the papers are pressed against tiles, the tiles move a little to the opposite side, according to the tolerance of the tile holes, and there will be no room to insert such papers in the opposite side, or when inserting them the first inserted papers may get out or fall.

In the end many of the paper strips were removed, only a few were kept in critical fibers.

## 3 The bundle making procedure

To make bundles, the 3 fibers of the most far end of some BC and D cells, are taken separately, and follow inner paths near the girder. For the remaining fibers, the fiber bundles are made in the sequence given by the fiber separator, starting from the nearest to the girder (A), and finishing in the outside (D). The fibers of each cell are grouped, and a lamp is used to check if all them are in the correct position, illuminating the free end of the bundle and checking the light getting out near the aluminized ends of the fibers. If it is found that there is no error, the bundle is adjusted in such a way that all the fibers have the ends together, and are inserted in the bundle tube, with the clear fibers (two per PMT). Small dummy fibers are used to complete the bundle rings, and the fibers of the bundle are hold together with a cable tie protected with soft plastic material. This process is repeated for all the cells.

The bundles are arranged in sub-bundles. For each bundle, typically two sub-bundles are made, one grouping the fibers located at left of the PMT, and the other with the fibers located at the right. The BC and D cells may have extra small bundles with 3 fibers only.

At this stage, the bundles of fibers are ready to be glued. After the glueing operation, the cable ties around the bundles are removed.

## 4 Region equipped with profiles

A small region of the module 0 is equipped with profiles. That region correspond to the 16 last half periods of the module, located in cells A10, B9, C8 and D4. The last 5 mm of the fibers near the aluminized end were glued to the profiles using a fast polimerization glue. Due to the very different values of the widths found in the iron gaps between masters, many of the profiles do not hold in place by themselves, requiring aluminium clips to keep them in position, with the fibers pressed against the tiles.

The fibers follow the usual sequences in the region equipped with the profiles, except in side 1 because at the moment the profiles of side 1 are exactly equal to the profiles of side 2, and they should be symetric in the position of A and B fibers. So, in side 1 the sequence for the fibers inside the profile is D under the profile, C inside the profile in the center, A at the left and B at the right. The sequence of the fibers in the ruler, in the direction from center of the module to the outside, is B DCA. This is valid only in the region equipped with profiles in the side 1.

## 5 Holding the bundles to the rail

The fibers are glued in the same sequence as the bundles are made, starting with cells of sampling A and finishing with cells of sampling D. This sequence allows all the movements of the fibers that are being glued while keeping the already glued fibers in place.

After the fibers have been glued, the bundles are forced to remain in a fixed position, tied to the rail using cables, occupying only the room foreseen for them. Special care is taken to ensure that the fiber curvature radius do not go below 5 cm. In between the end of the masters and the girder PMT line, a wide band is used to keep the fibers in place. The positions where the cables are fixed to the rail are free to have short horizontal movement during the iterative process of bundle holding. Only in the end, when all the bundles are tied to the rail, the fixation points are glued to the rail.
