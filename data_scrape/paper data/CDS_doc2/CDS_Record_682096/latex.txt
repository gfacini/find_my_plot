## 1 Introduction

**Precise measurements with the calorimeter in ATLAS stops at \(\eta=2.5\) and above this value the main use of the calorimeter is to detect the missing energy in the collision. Therefore in this region only two samplings are foreseen in the electromagnetic endcap calorimeter (EMEC) in contrast with the 3 compartments used elsewhere. The lengths of these two samplings can be chosen on the basis of the following requirements:**

_i_**) To minimize dynamic range of the signal amplification in each of the samplings;**

_ii_**) To be able to estimate the leakage of the electromagnetic showers to have a higher precision in the determination of its energy. This requirement is not crucial in the \(\eta>2.5\) region where as told, no high precision measurement of the electromagnetic shower is carried out;**

_iii_**) To increase the identification capability of the hadronic and electromagnetic component of a shower.**

Requirement _i_**) would suggest a division of equal length of the two samplings. On the other hand requirement _ii_**) would prefer a separation close to the end of the EMEC. The consequence of requirement _iii_**) on the sampling depths has not been studied until now.**The Method

We simulate energy deposits in the LAr in the two samplings of the EMEC for incident photons: \(E_{1}^{0}\), \(E_{2}^{0}\) and charged pions: \(E_{1}^{e}\), \(E_{2}^{e}\), respectively. In _fixed_ 'window' of total energy deposit: \(E^{t}\simeq E_{1}^{0}+E_{2}^{0}\simeq E_{1}^{e}+E_{2}^{e}\) we determine for each event an asymmetry factor:

\[A=\frac{E_{1}-E_{2}}{E_{1}+E_{2}}. \tag{1}\]

For example, if the length of the first sampling is equal to the half of the total depth of the EMEC, \(A\) for photons is usually positive and near \(+1\) while for charged pions \(A\approx 0\) except in the case when the charged pion produces energetic neutral pions either at the beginning (\(A\approx 1\)), or at the end (\(A\approx-1\)) of the EMEC e.g. via diffraction dissociation. Requesting therefore \(A>A_{\rm{evt}}>0\) one can reject more charged pions than photons. Denoting by \(N_{t}\) the number of events rejected by this cut out of a total number of events \(N_{t}\), we define a photon efficiency:

\[\epsilon_{\gamma}=\frac{N_{t}^{\gamma}-N_{\gamma}^{\gamma}}{N_{t}^{\gamma}} \tag{2}\]

and a charged pion rejection factor:

\[R=\frac{N_{t}^{e}}{N_{t}^{e}-N_{\gamma}^{e}}. \tag{3}\]

The optimization of the detector consists of finding a division of the EMEC with the highest possible rejection factor at a given photon efficiency \(\epsilon_{\gamma}\) (e.g. \(\epsilon_{\gamma}=0.9\)).

Was carried out a detailed simulation at \(\eta=2.8\) for energy deposit and energy leakage of photons of various energies between 0.5 and 100 GeV (called photon set, P.S.) and that of charged pions of 50 GeV and 100 GeV energy (called hadronic master set, M.S.) in the EMEC using the standard DICE simulation package [1]. To calculate the energy profile (i.e. the deposited energy distribution w.r.t. the calorimeter depth) in \(\approx 1\) cm steps, the program has been slightly modified [2]. The energy profile of the simulated photons has been stored in a shower library. In order to increase the statistics significantly we have also generated another hadronic set (called basic set, B.S.) where only the hadronic interactions were simulated and only the charged hadrons have been tracked. The energy profile of the incident charged pions have been reconstructed from the B.S. assuming that the deposited energy in the EMEC is due to neutral pions and these latters have been replaced by a photon of similar energy from the shower library. The average energy profile obtained by the B.S. has been compared to that of the M.S. Small differences between the two profiles (e.g. due to soft photons) have been corrected by weighting the B.S. profile with a linear function in 9 different depths. Figs.1 (2) show examples of the corrected energy profiles, for 50 (100) GeV incident charged pions. In these plots events were selected if the pions deposited less than 12 (15) GeV in the hadronic calorimeter and therefore the majority of these events deposited energy between 2.5 and 7.8 GeV (5 and 14 GeV) in LAr of EMEC.

Results

Fig. 3 shows asymmetry distributions for selected photons (a) and charged pions of 100 GeV (b) which deposited an energy between 5 and 14 GeV in the liquid argon of the EMEC. The length of the first sampling was chosen approximately 24 \(X_{0}\) (\(\approx L_{tot}*\) (40/50), where \(L_{tot}\) is the total depth of the EMEC). Fig. 3-c) corresponds to \(\pi^{\pm}\) where an energetic \(\pi^{0}\) above 20 GeV has been produced. No leakeage cut in the hadron calorimeter was applied. The "V" mark corresponds to \(\epsilon_{\gamma}=0.9\). Fig. 3 d-f are the same as Fig. 3 a-c except that now the length of the first sampling was chosen \(0.5*L_{tot}\).

**Comparing these figures one can see that:**

i) - if all \(\pi^{\pm}\) events are considered, the best rejection can be achieved choosing a longer first sampling ;**

ii) - however, this choice is no longer justified if a cut in leakeage is applied in the hadronic calorimeter, which is always the case;**

iii) - moreover, if one is aimed at rejecting those charged pions which produced an energetic

Conclusions

As we can see from Fig. 5, the highest pion rejection for _typical_ pion showers (no cut for secondary neutral pions) can be obtained with a first sampling close to the end of the EMEC. However, most of these typical showers will be rejected by the hadron calorimeter itself since they leak considerable energy into it.

If a leakeage cut in the hadronic calorimeter is applied (Fig. 7 and Fig. 8) a better rejection can be obtained when the first sampling is smaller than the half of the total depth.

In the cases where an energetic neutral pion is produced early in the hadronic shower the best rejection is obtained near the front face of the EMEC (Fig. 6). We have verified that the conclusions remain valid for the two chosen energies (50 and 100 GeV).

In conclusion, an optimum separation between charged pions and photons would favour a first sampling to be smaller in length than the second one.

However the gain in separation is not as high that could justify the change in the sampling lengths in the inner wheel compared with the outer one (where the last sampling starts at 24 \(X_{0}\)).
