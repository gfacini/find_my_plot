Abstract

The TDAQ Architecture has been defined and is described in the freshly submitted TDAQ TDR [1]. The architecture described there is based on two possible deployment schemes for the Readout system and leaves a small number of fine-tuning parameters inherent to the architecture open for settlement in the post TDR phase of the project. This note tries to summarize these (few) open issues and shows how these could allow for an _almost bottleneck-free architecture_ for Atlas TDAQ.

## Disclaimer and Acknowledgment

The ideas presented in this note are based upon ideas and work being done in the past years by the many people involved in the ATLAS TDAQ project, which culminated in the recently written Technical Design Report. Most of what is presented in the following is therefore not new but it is an extension of the now established ideas written in the TDR, and a compilation of ideas, thoughts and coffee table discussions on how to achieve an utmost flexible TDAQ system. The ATLAS TDAQ community is therefore acknowledged as a whole. As an active member of this community, I can confirm that the TDAQ environment is not always an easy place to work, but it has been proven to be always a stimulating place for developing ideas in order to face the many challenges of such a big system as ATLAS TDAQ has to cope with.
