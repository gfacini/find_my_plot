###### Abstract

This note presents a study of the \(\gamma\) identification capability of the ATLAS detector over the full rapidity coverage used for precision physics (\(\left|\eta\right|<2.5\)). The photon identification efficiency was evaluated with single photons and \(H\rightarrow\gamma\gamma\) events. Large statistics samples of fully simulated two-jet events were used to determine the rejection of the jet background. For a photon efficiency of \(\sim\)80%, an overall jet rejection of \(\sim\) 3600 (\(\sim\) 7500) was obtained for \(p_{T}\simeq 20\) (\(p_{T}\simeq 40\)) GeV.

Introduction

The main physics motivation for requiring excellent photon identification capability of the LHC detectors is the observation of a possible \(H\rightarrow\gamma\gamma\) signal in the range 80\(<m_{H}<\)130 GeV. This is the most difficult mass region for Higgs discovery at the LHC, due to the small signal cross-section (\(\sim 50\) fb) and to the large backgrounds.

The two main backgrounds are: the irreducible QCD \(\gamma\gamma\) continuum (\(\sigma\sim 1\) pb/GeV over the mass range 80-130 GeV), and the reducible \(\gamma\)-jet and jet-jet production when one or both jets fake a photon. The rate of the jet background is many orders of magnitude larger than the \(\gamma\gamma\) background: for pairs of calorimeter clusters which pass the kinematic cuts and have an invariant mass in the range 70-170 GeV, the ratios of the jet-jet and the \(\gamma\)-jet cross-sections to the irreducible \(\gamma\gamma\) cross-section are \(2\times 10^{6}\) and \(8\times 10^{2}\) respectively. Furthermore, there are large theoretical and experimental uncertainties on the jet production rate and on the fraction of jets which survive the photon identification criteria. These uncertainties are estimated to be:

* A factor \(\sim 2\) on the production cross-section, due to higher order corrections, structure function parametrisations, choice of the \(Q^{2}\) scale, etc.
* A factor \(\sim 1.5\) per jet (determined with LEP data [1]), arising from limited knowledge of the hard tails of the fragmentation function, i.e. the probability that the produced partons fragment into isolated \(\pi^{0}\)'s (\(\pi^{0}\ \rightarrow\ \gamma\gamma\) decays are the largest source of fake photons in the calorimeter).
* A factor of \(\sim 2\) per jet, coming from various uncertainties related to the detector response: knowledge of the detector geometry and of the amount of inactive material, physics processes in GEANT describing the interactions of hadrons in the calorimeters, etc.

These contributions add (quadratically) up to a total uncertainty of more than 5 on the jet-jet rate and of \(\sim 3\) on the \(\gamma\)-jet rate. Therefore, a rejection of about 5000 against jets is needed with high photon efficiency over the \(p_{T}\) range relevant to \(H\rightarrow\gamma\gamma\) searches (\(p_{T}=25\)-75 GeV), in order to reduce the jet background safely below (\(\leq 20\%\) of) the irreducible \(\gamma\gamma\) continuum.

In ATLAS, most of the rejection is achieved by using the fine transverse and longitudinal segmentation of the electromagnetic calorimeter, as it will be shown in the following sections.

After all cuts using the calorimeter information, the residual jet background consists mainly of events in which the original partons fragmented into high-\(p_{T}\) isolated \(\pi^{0}\)'s. It has already been demonstrated [2, 3], that a rejection of three against \(\pi^{0}\)'s is needed in order to achieve the required suppression of the jet background. This requires a "preshower-like" device and is the main motivation for a strip section in the first compartment of the ATLAS electromagnetic calorimeter [4].

In order to realistically evaluate the \(\gamma\)/jet separation power of the ATLAS detector, two high-statistics samples of high-\(p_{T}\) di-jet events have been generated, fully simulated in the calorimeters and inner detector, and analysed. Single photons and \(H\to\gamma\gamma\) events have been used to determine the photon efficiency. The contributions of the noise of the calorimeter electronics and of the pile-up expected at high luminosity have been taken into account.

The results of this work are summarised in this note, which is organised as follows. Section 2 describes the data samples and the detector layout. Section 3 discusses the \(\gamma\)/jet separation criteria used in the analysis. The resulting rejections and efficiencies are given in Section 4. Finally Section 5 is devoted to the conclusions.

## 2 Data samples and detector layout

Two streams of high-\(p_{T}\) di-jet events, allowing to cover the full \(p_{T}\) range interesting for the \(H\to\gamma\gamma\) channel, were generated with PYTHIA 5.7 [5] over the rapidity region \(|\eta|<3\):

* A sample [A] of \(10^{6}\) jets, generated with a cut \(p_{T}>17\) GeV on the parton transverse momentum (at the level of the hard scattering process).
* A sample [B] of \(2\times 10^{5}\) jets, generated with a cut \(p_{T}>35\) GeV on the parton transverse momentum (at the level of the hard scattering process).

Initial and final state radiation was included. The total cross-section (\(\sim 0.3\) mb) is dominated by the \(qg\to qg\) and \(gg\to gg\) processes. "Signal" processes, such as prompt photon, \(t\overline{t}\), W and Z production, were also switched on in the generation. More details about this jet production can be found in Refs. [5, 6].

The above samples were then reduced by a further particle-level filter, aiming at eliminating events which would surely fail the LVL1 trigger selection. This filter accepted only events with at least one cone of size \(\Delta\eta\times\Delta\phi=0.12\times 0.12\) (resp. \(0.2\times 0.2\)) containing a total transverse energy, summed over all stable particles in the cone others than muons and neutrinos, larger than 15 GeV (resp. 35 GeV) for sample [A] (resp. [B]).

The surviving jets, about 14% of the initial statistics for sample [A] and 25% for sample [B], were then processed through a full simulation of the inner detector, electromagnetic (EM) and hadronic (HAD) calorimeters.

The detector layout used for this jet production was an old and simplified layout. The main differences with the more recent design proposed in the Technical Proposal (TP) are [4]:

1. Inner Detector: the so called "Cosener's House" layout, which is now obsolete, has been used [6]. The main difference relevant to this note with respect to the present layout is that the "Cosener's House" had a larger amount of material, reaching a maximum of \(\sim 1\)\(X_{0}\) at \(\eta\sim 1.7\), as compared to a maximum of \(\sim 0.7\)\(X_{0}\) in the present layout. Therefore the number of photons converting in the inner detector was larger for the "Cosener's House" layout than for the present layout. Since converted photons are identified with lower efficiency than non-converted photons (see Section 4.4), the results presented here are to be considered somewhat conservative.
2. Electromagnetic calorimeter: a simplified parallel plate detector was simulated, both in the barrel and in the end-cap regions. The lead thickness in the absorber plates was 1.8 mm for \(|\eta|<0.8\) and \(|\eta|>1.4\), and 1.2 mm for \(0.8<|\eta|<1.4\). The parallel geometry and the larger calorimeter density (as compared to the present layout, which has thinner absorber plates) are not expected to have a significant impact on the overall rejection.
3. Preshower: a separate preshower detector in front of the EM calorimeter, as originally proposed in the ATLAS LoI [7], was simulated instead of the integrated \(\eta\)-strips of the present layout. The preshower [8] consisted of a 2 \(X_{0}\) (tapered with rapidity) absorber layer, followed by 1 cm of active LAr, by a second absorber layer (1 \(X_{0}\), tapered) and by another 1 cm of active LAr. The two active layers were equipped with 3 mm wide strips, sensitive to the \(\phi\) view in the first layer and to the \(\eta\) view in the second layer. Detailed full simulation studies [9] with samples of single photons and \(\pi^{0}\)'s of \(p_{T}=50\) GeV have shown that for photons non-converted in the inner detector the \(\pi^{0}\) rejections obtained with the separate preshower and with the integrated \(\eta\)-strips are similar (\(\sim 3\)). When also converted photons are considered, the performance of the separate preshower is deteriorated (rejection \(\sim 2\)), due to its sensitivity to the \(\phi\) view, which is affected by the magnetic field. However, if the information of the inner detector is used to recognise converted photons from converted \(\pi^{0}\)'s, a rejection close to 3 is recovered. Therefore the separate preshower and the integrated strip geometry are expected to have similar performance.

In conclusion, the results presented in this note are not expected to be significantly affected because of the evolution of the detector design since the time of the jet production. They were obtained from the first full simulation study of the \(\gamma\)/jet separation in ATLAS, and they give a first-order answer to the problem of photon identification in the difficult LHC environment. They need to be checked in the future with new jet samples produced with the most up-to-date detector layout and larger statistics.

The simulated events were further reduced by running a LV L1 trigger algorithm, similar to the standard LV L1 algorithm of ATLAS. The cluster threshold requirement accepted only events with a minimum transverse energy deposition of 15 GeV in the EM calorimeter in a window of \(2\times 1\) or \(1\times 2\) trigger towers 1 in \(\eta\times\phi\). The isolation requirement selected events with transverse energy less that 5 GeV in a region of 12 (resp. 16) trigger towers in the electromagnetic (resp. hadronic) calorimeter around (resp. behind) the cluster core of \(2\times 2\) trigger towers. These selections rejected about 85% of the low-\(p_{T}\) sample and 97% of the high-\(p_{T}\) sample, thus leading to manageable data sets: about 10000 events for sample [A] and about 1500 events for sample [B]. The total rejection up to this level was therefore \(\sim 50\) for sample [A] and \(\sim 120\) for sample [B].

Footnote 1: A trigger tower covers four calorimeter cells in both directions, i.e. a region \(\Delta\eta\times\Delta\phi\simeq 0.1\times 0.1\).

The event samples used for the analysis described in this note were obtained after applying a further restriction: only jets within rapidity \(|\eta|<2.5\) were considered, since this is the range covered by the preshower detector, both in the old and in the present layout.

Several "signal" samples were used in parallel to optimise the \(\gamma\)/jet separation criteria and to determine the photon identification efficiency:

* \(\sim 1500\) fully simulated single photons with \(p_{T}=20\) GeV, uniformly distributed over the rapidity range \(|\eta|<2.5\).
* \(\sim 3000\) fully simulated single photons with \(p_{T}=40\) GeV, uniformly distributed over the rapidity range \(|\eta|<2.5\).
* \(\sim 2000\) fully simulated \(H\to\gamma\gamma\) events with \(m_{H}=100\) GeV.

The efficiency of the selections described above on these samples was found to be close to 100%.

The analysis and results presented in Sections 3 and 4.1-4.4 have been obtained without including the contribution of the electronic noise and pileup. Their effect will be discussed in Section 4.6.

## 3 \(\gamma\)/jet separation criteria

The photon/jet identification procedure consisted of two steps: in a first step, the information of the hadronic and electromagnetic calorimeters was used to reject the jet background to the level of (mainly) isolated \(\pi^{0}\)'s. In a second step, the signal shape in the preshower detector was analysed in order to recognise single showers produced by isolated photons from overlapping showers produced in the two-photon decay of \(\pi^{0}\)'s.

### Calorimeter cuts

The following variables, based on the different lateral and longitudinal shapes of showers produced by photons and jets, were used to reject the jet background while maintaining a high efficiency for the photon signal:* EM transverse energy (\(E_{T}^{em}\)). Only a fraction of the energy of a jet is deposited in the electromagnetic calorimeter, and this energy is usually spread over many cells. For a jet to simulate a photon, a significant amount of energy has to be deposited in the small region of the EM calorimeter (\(3\times 5\) cells in \(\eta\times\phi\)) in which a photon shower is fully contained. The LVL1 trigger cuts described in Section 2 allowed to select jets with a large electromagnetic component. However, neither the full calorimeter granularity nor the best refined set of calibration constants can be used at LVL1. At LVL2, LVL3 and off-line, where full granularity and calibration are available, stronger cuts on the energy deposited in a small region of the EM calorimeter can be applied. It was therefore required that the transverse energy deposited in a cluster of \(3\times 5\) cells be above 17 GeV (resp. 35 GeV) for sample [A] (resp. [B]). The choice of an asymmetric cluster, larger in \(\phi\) than in \(\eta\), was motivated by photon conversion in the inner tracker and by the subsequent opening of the electron-positron pair in \(\phi\) due to the 2 T field [8].
* Hadronic leakage (\(E_{T}^{had}\)). The energy deposited in the hadronic calorimeter, in a region of size \(\Delta\eta\times\Delta\phi=0.2\times 0.2\) (\(2\times 2\) towers) behind the electromagnetic cluster, was required to be small (less than 500 MeV).
* EM isolation (\(R^{isol}\)). The shower in the EM calorimeter was asked to be isolated, that is the energy leaking outside the \(3\times 5\) cell cluster into a region of \(7\times 7\) cells was required to be less than \(\sim 10\%\) of the shower energy contained in the \(3\times 5\) cell cluster.
* Shower width (\(\sigma_{w}\)). A single photon shower is expected to be narrower than the shower produced by a jet of particles. The shower width, defined as the second order moment of the energy distribution in \(\eta\) and \(\phi\) (\(\sigma_{w}=\sqrt{(\sigma_{9}{}^{2}+\sigma_{\phi}{}^{2})/2}\)), was required to be compatible with the size of a single shower 2. A typical cut was \(\sigma_{w}<10\) mrad. Footnote 2: Since the shower width depends on the particle impact point inside a cell, the shower appearing narrower at the cell centre and broader at the cell edges, suitable corrections to \(\sigma_{\eta}\) and \(\sigma_{\phi}\) as a function of position were applied.
* Shower lateral profile (\(R^{core}\)). For single electrons or photons most of the shower energy is concentrated in a "core" of three-four cells. The ratio between the energy deposited in the four most energetic cells of the cluster and the energy deposited in the cluster was therefore required to be large (typically \(>\) 65%).

The distributions of some of these variables for photons and jets are shown in Figs. 1 (sample [A]) and 2 (sample [B]).

Cuts on these variables were optimised separately in three different rapidity regions

\[\begin{array}{l}|\eta|<0.8\\ 0.8<|\eta|<1.5\\ 1.5<|\eta|<2.5\end{array}\]Figure 1: Distributions of the calorimeter variables used to recognise photon showers from jet showers for photons of \(p_{T}\) = 20 GeV (full line) and jets from sample \([A]\) (dashed line).

Figure 2: Distributions of the calorimeter variables used to recognise photon showers from jet showers for photons of \(p_{T}\) = 40 GeV (full line) and jets from sample [B] (dashed line).

so as to keep an approximately constant photon efficiency of \(\sim 90\%\) with rapidity. At \(\eta\)=0.8 the lead thickness in the absorber plates changes, thus the calorimeter density and the shower size change. Rapidity \(\eta=1.5\) sets the transition between the barrel and the end-cap calorimeter. The amount of material in front of the calorimeter, which affects the shower shape, is also different in the three regions. It is the largest at the end of the barrel and at the transition between the barrel and the end-cap calorimeter, i.e. in the range \(0.8<|\eta|<1.8\). As an example, Table 1 shows the optimised values of the cuts, for the high-\(p_{T}\) sample, as a function of rapidity.

As it will be discussed more extensively in Section 4.1, after the selections described in Section 2 and in this section, jet rejections (\(R_{jet}\)) of

\[R_{jet}\simeq\,1200\quad\mbox{for sample [A]}\] \[R_{jet}\simeq\,2500\quad\mbox{for sample [B]}\]

were obtained. In both cases the efficiency on single photons was \(\sim 90\%\).

As anticipated in Section 1, a further rejection of \(\sim 3\) is needed in order to achieve a total suppression factor of \(\sim 5000\), averaged over the range \(p_{T}=25-75\) GeV. This is the subject of Section 3.3.

### The surviving sample

The calorimeter cuts described in the previous section selected events containing at least one shower in the EM calorimeter with lateral and longitudinal shape compatible with an electromagnetic shower. The surviving showers of sample [A] are classified in Table 2 according to their origin.

It can be seen that about 80% of the surviving showers are due to jets containing high-\(p_{T}\) scalar mesons (\(\pi^{0},\eta,\omega,\eta\)) decaying into a pair of photons. Most of these are single isolated \(\pi^{0}\)'s.

Also single photons are produced, mainly from quark bremsstrahlung, but also from radiative decays of heavy mesons (\(B^{*}\)).

A few percent of the events contain isolated charged (\(\pi^{\pm},K^{\pm},p\)) or neutral (\(n,\overline{n},K^{0}\)) hadrons depositing a large fraction of their energy in the electromagnetic calorimeter.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|c|} \hline variable & \multicolumn{3}{c|}{cut value} \\  & \(|\eta|<0.8\) & \(0.8\leq|\eta|<1.5\) & \(1.5\leq|\eta|<2.5\) \\ \hline \(E_{T}^{em}\) ( GeV) & 35 & 35 & 35 \\ \(E_{T}^{had}\) ( GeV) & 0.5 & 0.5 & 0.5 \\ \(R^{isol}\) & 0.08 & 0.13 & 0.12 \\ \(\sigma_{w}\) ( rad) & 0.009 & 0.011 & 0.012 \\ \(R^{core}\) & 0.7 & 0.65 & 0.68 \\ \hline Photon efficiency & (92\(\pm\)3)\% & (88\(\pm\)4)\% & (93\(\pm\)3)\% \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 1: Optimal cuts for \(\gamma\)/jet separation in three rapidity regions of the calorimeter. Jets are from sample [B] and photons are from the \(p_{T}=40\) GeV sample. The total photon efficiency after all these cuts is also given.

Finally, the sample includes events due to other processes than QCD jet production (direct photons, \(W\to e\nu\) and \(Z\to ee\) decays, etc.), as mentioned in Section 2. These will be used to monitor the selection efficiency (see Section 4.5) and removed at the end of the analysis.

### Preshower cuts

Table 2 shows that the events surviving the calorimeter cuts consist mainly of isolated energetic \(\pi^{0}\)'s. The two photons produced in the decay of these \(\pi^{0}\)'s are only a few millimeters apart from each other. For instance, for \(\pi^{0}\)'s of \(p_{T}\simeq 50\) GeV the average two-photon separation at the calorimeter front face is \(\sim 7.5\) mm in the barrel, going down to \(\sim 5\) mm in the end-cap at \(\eta=2\). Therefore, the identification of these overlapping photons from single \(\gamma\)'s requires a much finer detector granularity than the EM calorimeter towers. Several "preshower" options have been extensively studied in ATLAS, the \(\gamma/\pi^{0}\) separation capability being the key performance issue for the choice of the best layout [9]. Although the integrated \(\eta\)-strip solution has been chosen, the results presented here were obtained with a separate preshower, because the jet samples were generated with this geometry, as already discussed in Section 2.

The energy pattern in the preshower region in front of a photon candidate in the calorimeter was analysed. As in the calorimeter, the photon identification was based on the shower shape, since showers produced by single photons are usually narrower than showers produced by overlapping photons from \(\pi^{0}\) decays. The following variables were used:

* Energy in the two preshower layers. A non negligible fraction of single photons (\(\sim 10\%\) at \(\eta=0\)) traverse the preshower detector without converting. This fraction is smaller for \(\pi^{0}\) events (a few percent at \(\eta=0\)) because they contain two photons. Therefore, photon candidates releasing less than 1 mip in the most energetic strip of the first or second preshower layer were retained as photons 3. The rest of the events were subject to further investigation.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|} \hline Showers from: & Fraction in the sample \\ \hline isolated \(\pi^{0}\rightarrow\gamma\gamma\) & 59\% \\ multiple \(\pi^{0}\rightarrow\gamma\gamma\) & 14\% \\ \(\eta,\eta\rightarrow\gamma\gamma,\omega\to 2\gamma,3\gamma\) & 6\% \\ quark bremsstrahlung & 12\% \\ direct \(\gamma\)’s & 4\% \\ electrons (from b, W, Z decays) & 4\% \\ others (\(B^{*}\), single hadrons, etc.) & 1\% \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}

Dashed line: photons of \(p_{T}=20\) GeV. Full line: jets from sample [A].

Figure 4: Distributions of variables used to recognise photon showers from residual jets (mainly \(\pi^{0}\)’s) in the preshower after calorimeter cuts. Dashed line: photons of \(p_{T}=40\) GeV. Full line: jets from sample [B].

* Profile. Since most of the energy of a single photon shower (\(\sim 75\%\)) is contained in a cluster of three strips (see Figs. 3 and 4 middle), the shower profile was defined, in each layer, as the ratio between the energy deposited in the most energetic triplet of adjacent strips and the energy deposited in 20 strips centered on the strip with the highest signal.
* Isolation. The energy of the second most energetic cluster in the second preshower layer was required to be small (typically less than 15 mip).

Distributions of these variables for photons and for residual jets surviving the calorimeter cuts are shown in Figs. 3 and 4. The optimised set of preshower cuts for the high-\(p_{T}\) sample is listed in Table 3. These cuts were tuned with rapidity to get a constant photon efficiency of \(\sim 80\%\) after the calorimeter and preshower selections.

The rejection obtained with the preshower is \(\sim 2\) (averaged over rapidity) for a photon efficiency of \(\sim 90\%\). This result is in agreement with studies [9] of \(\gamma/\pi^{0}\) identification performed with the separate preshower layout but using only preshower cuts, thus indicating that the calorimeter cuts described in Section 3.1 do not select a special sub-sample of "narrow" \(\pi^{0}\)'s.

Furthermore, despite the fact that converted photons were present in the samples, no use of the tracker information has been made in this study. These results are therefore to be considered conservative.

## 4 Results

This section is devoted to a more detailed discussion of the results presented in the previous sections.

### Jet rejection

Tables 4 and 5 show the jet rejection achieved at the various steps of the analysis for the two samples. These numbers were obtained after removing events not due to QCD jet production, like \(W\) and \(Z\) decays to electrons and prompt photons (see Section 4.5), and after suitably renormalising the samples.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|c|} \hline variable & \multicolumn{3}{c|}{cut value} \\  & \(|\eta|<0.8\) & \(0.8\leq|\eta|<1.5\) & \(1.5\leq|\eta|<2.5\) \\ \hline E of most energetic strips (mip) & 1 & 1 & 1 \\ profile in \(\eta\) & 0.6 & 0.55 & 0.65 \\ profile in \(\phi\) & 0.6 & 0.45 & 0.45 \\ E of second shower (mip) & 15 & 15 & 15 \\ \hline Photon efficiency & (78\(\pm\)5)\% & (79\(\pm\)6)\% & (82\(\pm\)5)\% \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 3: Optimal cuts for \(\gamma/\pi^{0}\) separation in three rapidity regions of the preshower. Jets are from sample [B] and photons are from the \(p_{T}=40\) GeV sample. The total photon efficiency after all (calorimeter and preshower) cuts is also given.

The overall rejection is

\[\begin{array}{l}R_{jet}=2600\pm 130\quad\mbox{sample [A]}\\ R_{jet}=5200\pm 320\quad\mbox{sample [B]},\end{array}\]

corresponding to a photon efficiency \(\varepsilon_{\gamma}=(82\pm 1)\%\) (photons of \(p_{T}=20\) GeV) and \(\varepsilon_{\gamma}=80\pm 3\%\) (photons of \(p_{T}=40\) GeV) respectively. As already mentioned, these results were obtained without including the electronic noise and the pile-up.

The uncertainty on these numbers, taking into account the fact that an old detector layout has been simulated, is expected to be of the order of \(\pm\) 40%. This uncertainty was estimated by looking at how the rejection changes with rapidity (Table 4). Since the material in front of the calorimeter, the calorimeter density and the preshower granularity change with \(\eta\), the rapidity dependence of the rejection gives the sensitivity of the \(\gamma\)/jet separation capability to the exact parameters of the detector layout.

Both Tables show that, after the LV L1 trigger selection, the calorimeter provides a further rejection of 20-25, and the preshower another factor of \(\sim\) 2. It has been demonstrated [9] that a rejection of \(\sim\) 3 can be achieved in the preshower when also the tracker information is used to treat the conversions, which has not been done in this analysis. The effect of this improvement on the overall jet rejection is visible in the last line of each Table.

It can also be seen (Table 4) that, for a fixed photon efficiency, the rejection is smaller at the end of the barrel than in the rest of the acceptance. This is

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|c|c|} \hline Selection level & \(|\eta|<0.8\) & \(0.8<|\eta|<1.5\) & \(1.5<|\eta|<2.5\) & \(|\eta|<2.5\) \\ \hline After particle level filter & & & & 7 \\ \hline After “LV L1” & & & & 50 \\ \hline After calorimeter & 14 00 & 1000 & 1200 & 1200 \\ \hline After preshower & 2900\(\pm\)300 & 2360\(\pm\)180 & 2700\(\pm\)170 & 2600 \(\pm\)130 \\ \hline After preshower (R\({}_{*0}\!=\!3\)) & 4 200 & 3000 & 3600 & 3600 \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|} \hline Selection level & \(|\eta|<2.5\) \\ \hline After particle level filter & 4 \\ \hline After “LV L1” & 125 \\ \hline After calorimeter & 2500\(\pm\)180 \\ \hline After preshower & 5200\(\pm\)320 \\ \hline After preshower (R\({}_{*}\!=\!3\)) & 7500 \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}

due to the larger amount of material in front of the EM calorimeter, which broadens the shower shape and therefore reduces the single photon efficiency.

### The surviving events

About 350 photon candidates survive all cuts in the low-\(p_{T}\) sample. More than 80% of these candidates are photon pairs produced in \(\pi^{0}\) or \(\eta\) decays and surviving the preshower cuts, about 10% are photons radiated by quarks, and about 8% are electrons produced in the semileptonic decays of heavy quarks (\(c\), and mainly \(b\)). Finally, eight events contain single charged hadrons (\(\pi^{\pm}\), \(K^{\pm}\)) depositing most of their energy in the electromagnetic calorimeter.

### Use of the tracker

It has also been investigated whether a track veto in the inner detector can improve the rejection after all the identification cuts described in the previous sections. This has been studied in a simplified way in the present analysis, i.e. by using the generation bank (KINE) to find charged particles pointing to the calorimeter cluster.

By requiring that no tracks with \(p_{T}>5\) GeV are inside a cone of size \(\Delta R=0.5\) around the direction of the photon candidate, the rejection was further improved by 30% after all calorimeter and preshower cuts. In the low-\(p_{T}\) sample this requirement rejects the following classes of events (see Section 4.2):

* events containing charged hadrons which are completely absorbed in the electromagnetic calorimeter.
* events containing genuine electrons produced in the semileptonic decays of heavy mesons (\(D,D^{*},B\)).
* events containing photons from quark bremsstrahlung or pair of photons from \(\pi^{0}\) decays overlapped to soft charged hadrons.

Converted photons, which are not present in the KINE bank because they are produced in the subsequent interaction with the detector, were not rejected.

The efficiency of this track veto was found to be about 97% on a sample of \(H\rightarrow\gamma\gamma\) events. Pile-up was not included for this estimate, however the 5 GeV cut on the track minimum \(p_{T}\) can be considered large enough to expect a signal efficiency close to 100% also in the presence of pile-up at high luminosity [10].

The effect of the track veto on converted photons was not evaluated. However, converted photons should be recognised with high efficiency by requiring two tracks in the inner detector pointing to the calorimeter shower, with a total momentum matching the shower energy. Full reconstruction of the conversion point in the tracker should also be possible in most cases. Assuming a track reconstruction efficiency of \(\sim 95\%\) for electrons, the probability that one of the two tracks from a photon conversion is not detected is about 10%. Since the fraction of converted photons is \(\sim 20\%\), this track veto is not expected to significantly deteriorate the overall signal efficiency.

However, due to these uncertainties, and following a conservative approach, the 30% further rejection provided by the track veto was not included in the final results of this study, nor in the numbers presented in the TP. It can be considered as a safety margin compensating other effects which decrease the rejection, such as electronic noise and pile-up (see Section 4.6).

In conclusion, the role of the inner detector for the \(\gamma\)/jet separation is twofold: it contributes significantly to the \(\gamma\)/\(\pi^{0}\) identification in the presence of converted photons, and allows for some extra-rejection after the calorimeter and preshower selections through track-veto requirements.

### Photon efficiency

The photon efficiency of the cuts described in Sections 3.1 and 3.3 was also evaluated with complete physics events, by analysing a sample of \(\sim 2000\) fully simulated \(H\to\gamma\gamma\) events with \(m_{H}=100\) GeV. The result was

\[\varepsilon_{\gamma}=(81.7\pm 2.5)\%\]

in agreement with the efficiency obtained with the samples of single photons.

Figure 5 shows the total photon efficiency after all cuts, obtained with the \(H\to\gamma\gamma\) sample, as a function of rapidity. It can be seen that the efficiency

drops by about a factor of 1.5 in the region around \(\eta\sim 1.5\), which corresponds to the transition between the barrel and the end-cap calorimeters. In this region the upstream material (inner detector, cryostat walls, cables, services, etc.) reaches its maximum (\(\sim 4\ X_{0}\)). As a consequence, the shower shape is significantly broadened, and a large fraction of single photons fail the identification criteria. It was found that the main loss is due to the preshower cuts.

The efficiency of the calorimeter cuts for photons converted and non-converted in the inner detector is shown in Fig. 6. The overall efficiency is 91%, the efficiency for unconverted photons being 92% and the one for converted photons 87%. The latter are reconstructed with smaller efficiency because they usually give rise to broader showers in the calorimeter and preshower.

The efficiency for unconverted photons is constant with rapidity. This is because, as already mentioned, cuts have been tuned to get a constant efficiency with \(\eta\) for the full photon sample, which is dominated by unconverted photons (\(\sim 80\%\) of the total). The efficiency for converted photons, on the other hand, has a stronger \(\eta\) dependence. It is smaller (about 75%) in the range \(0.8<|\eta|<1.6\), where the upstream material reaches its maximum. It becomes similar to the efficiency for non-converted photons in the end-cap region, where the distance (in the transverse plane) between the tracker layers

and the particle impact point on the calorimeter is smaller, so that the \(e^{+}e^{-}\) pairs produced in the conversions are less opened by the magnetic field.

No effort was done for the analysis presented here to optimise the cuts for events with conversions.

This study has also shown that the total acceptance for the \(H\to\gamma\gamma\) signal, which includes the acceptance of the kinematic cuts and the acceptance in the mass bin, increases by \(\sim 15\%\) when the two photons from the Higgs decay are required to satisfy the identification criteria. This is because the photon efficiency is smaller for converted photons and for photons crossing the transition region between the barrel and the end-cap calorimeter. But these photons have the largest probability of failing the kinematic cuts or of being in the tails of the invariant mass distribution outside the mass bin. Therefore, applying the full identification procedure, rather than simply scaling the signal cross-section by \(\epsilon_{\gamma}^{2}\), removes events which in any case would not be accepted. The corresponding effect on the signal significance is a gain of \(\sim 10\%\).

### Signal processes

Besides QCD di-jet production, several signal processes were included in the generated samples, as already mentioned. As a consistency check, the efficiency of the photon identification criteria described in the previous sections was evaluated for the electrons and photons produced in these signal events. The results are shown in Table 6.

The efficiency for events containing prompt photons or isolated electrons, such as those produced in the decays of \(W\)'s and \(Z\)'s, is compatible with the efficiency found for \(H\to\gamma\gamma\) events, as expected. On the other hand, the efficiency for electrons produced in the semileptonic decays of b-quarks is significantly smaller, because these electrons are in general non-isolated. It is even smaller for electrons from c-quarks, since they are usually softer.

The large errors on the numbers in Table 6 are due to the low statistics of these signal events in the jet samples.

### Electronic noise and pile-up

The results discussed in the previous sections were obtained without taking into account the electronic noise in the calorimeter and preshower channels, nor the pile-up at high luminosity. Their effect is expected to deteriorate the

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|} \hline Process & Electron/photon efficiency (\%) \\ \hline \(W\to e\nu,Z\to ee\) & 83 \(\pm\) 10 \\ Prompt \(\gamma\)’s & 77 \(\pm\) 3 \\ \(b\to e\) & 27 \(\pm\) 8 \\ \(c\to e\) & 12 \(\pm\) 6 \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 6: Efficiency of the photon identification criteria for various classes of signal events from sample [A].

photon efficiency, and therefore the jet rejection, if a given photon efficiency of \(\sim 80\%\) is desired.

The analysis described in Section 3 was repeated after including the electronic and pile-up noise. The electronic noise was simulated as a gaussian smearing of the energy deposited in each cell. The r.m.s. values given in Ref. [4] were used 4. For a cluster of \(3\times 5\) cells in the EM calorimeter at \(\eta\)=0 the noise is about 200 MeV.

Footnote 4: The electronic noise was assumed to be zero in the Tile calorimeter.

In the signal samples (single photons and \(H\rightarrow\gamma\gamma\) events) the pile-up was fully simulated by overlapping to a given event the expected 36 minimum-bias events in the LAr calorimeters and 18 minimum-bias events in the Tile calorimeter. The signal shaping was not implemented. For a cluster of \(3\times 5\) cells in the EM calorimeter at \(\eta\)=0 the gaussian part of the pile-up noise has an r.m.s. of about 300 MeV. Since this procedure is extremely CPU-time consuming for the jet samples, the pile-up was included as a gaussian smearing of the energy deposited in each cell in this case.

As expected, it was found that, in order to keep the same photon efficiency, most of the cuts had to be relaxed (compare Table 7 to Table 1). However, the effect of the noise and pile-up could be minimised by considering, in the reconstruction, only cells with an energy deposition larger than two times the r.m.s. of the total noise (electronic plus pile-up).

With this threshold cut, the loss in rejection was found to be \(\sim 10\%\) for both samples. As already mentioned in Section 4.3, the expected gain of \(\sim 30\%\) in the rejection from a track veto in the inner detector could compensate for the performance deterioration due to the noise.

Figure 7 shows the jet rejection as a function of the photon efficiency obtained for the high-\(p_{T}\) sample with and without adding the electronic and pile-up noise.

## 5 Conclusions

A complete study of the \(\gamma\)/jet separation capability of the ATLAS detector, performed with full simulation, has been presented.

\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|c|} \hline variable & \multicolumn{3}{c|}{cut value} \\  & \(|\eta|<0.8\) & \(0.8\leq|\eta|<1.5\) & \(1.5\leq|\eta|<2.5\) \\ \hline \(E_{T}^{em}\) ( GeV) & 35 & 35 & 35 \\ \(E_{T}^{had}\) ( GeV) & 2 & 2 & 2 \\ \(R^{isol}\) & 0.19 & 0.2 & 0.18 \\ \(\sigma_{w}\) ( rad) & 0.01 & 0.012 & 0.013 \\ \(R^{core}\) & 0.75 & 0.7 & 0.7 \\ \hline \end{tabular}

The photon identification efficiencies are 90% (dashed curve) and 80% (full curve)._

Jet rejections of about 2600 for \(p_{T}\simeq\)20 GeV and 5200 for \(p_{T}\simeq\)40 GeV were achieved with the calorimeter and preshower detector for high photon efficiency (\(\sim\) 80%). If a \(\pi^{0}\) rejection factor of \(\sim\) 3 is assumed, as demonstrated by other studies using the information of the inner detector in the presence of converted photons, these rejections increase to \(\sim\) 3600 and \(\sim\) 7500 respectively.

Although the simulated detector layout was different from the present design, these results are considered to be reliable within \(\pm\) 40%. They are most likely on the conservative side, since the calorimeter design has evolved toward a better layout in terms of material, energy and position resolution and particle identification capability.

The impact on the total background to the \(H\rightarrow\gamma\gamma\) channel is presented in Fig. 8, which shows the expected rate of the jet background, compared to the \(\gamma\gamma\) irreducible background, over the mass region relevant to \(H\rightarrow\gamma\gamma\) searches. These curves have been obtained with a particle level analysis [11]: the \(\gamma\gamma\), \(\gamma\)/jet and jet-jet processes were generated with PYTHIA, the kinematic cuts of the standard \(H\rightarrow\gamma\gamma\) analysis were applied to the photons and jets in the final state, and the rates were suitably scaled assuming a jet rejection factor of 3600 for \(p_{T}=25\) GeV, increasing linearly with \(p_{T}\) to a value of 7200 for \(p_{T}=40\) GeV, and saturating at a value of 1000. An efficiency of 80% per photon was included. It can be seen that, after \(\pi^{0}\) rejection, the total jet background (\(\gamma\)-jet plus jet-jet) amounts to less than 20% of the \(\gamma\gamma\) continuum.

This demonstrates that the full use of the ATLAS detector potential should achieve the goal of bringing the reducible background from jet-jet and \(\gamma\)-jet processes safely below the irreducible \(\gamma\gamma\) background, even in the difficult conditions of high-luminosity LHC operation.
