May 19943. Billets preparation for contour machining After cutting and grinding allbilets had up to 5mm of nonplanarity. To obtain the satisfactory planarity allbilets passed necessary corrections by rolling.

 4. Billets final machining ( on contour ) and holes drilling.  4.1. Master plates production.  4.1.1. Preparatory works; rigging.  For master plate contour machining we prepared 2 auxiliary elements ( rigging ): template and support plate with the base pins - s onamed drill jig. ( See Fig.4 ) Machining was done on 2 shop-machines. On each one was put 4 plates stack. For machining was used end milling cutters.  To assemble billets in auxiliary fixing element ( rigging ) each billeth had 3 "basic holes". They were done on high precision coordinate - boring shop machine.( See Fig.5 ).  4.1.2.  To drill holes we prepared high precision "conductor", i.e.drill jig, with 3 different renewable jig bushings:  - : 7.6mm for thedrill  - : 7.85mm for the coredrill  - : 8.0mm for thereamer  Drilling of holes was done through the drill jig using simultaneously 2-3 plates stack. Relative orientation plates/drill jig was done through the same 3 basic holes, which were also using when edge machining.  The holes diameters were controlled by 2 plugs (corks) - insertable and not insertable ones ( first can move "in", last one - not ).  Interaxis distances were controlled on high precision coordinate - boring machine ( periodically during the whole production cycle ).

 4.2. Outside plate contour control  After master plates passed contour machining we took top and bottom plates from each stack for control measurements:(See Fig.6)  Anticorrosion 'cleaning and protection was reached by ortophosphorous acid ( 50% concentration in water ).

5. Spacers fabrication - base holes drilling : 8 + 0.01 mm: - machining of A-surface - machining of C-surface - machining of D- and E-surfaces - h1 and h2 dimensions control ( See Fig.7 )
6. Edge plates ( S = 20mm ) produ@tion - These plates surface machining was done on jig boring mill alternately from both sides in order to obtain satisfactory nonplanarity with consequent polishing. - All : 6.5mm holes final mashing was done on coordinate - boring mill. - Anticorrosion protection: by ortop phosphorous acid.
