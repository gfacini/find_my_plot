Introduction

The measurement of the mass of the \(W\) boson, \(m_{W}\), is of primary importance for the physics programme at the LHC. In the standard model (SM), radiative corrections to the \(W\)-boson propagator are dominated by loops containing top and bottom quarks, but also depend logarithmically on the mass of the Higgs boson \(m_{H}\). Therefore, precise measurements of the mass of the Higgs boson, of the \(W\) boson, and of the top quark, provide a stringent test of the SM. Moreover, the measurement of \(m_{W}\) provides indirect constraints on \(m_{H}\) through a global fit of the SM parameters [1], and a comparison of the indirect determination of \(m_{H}\) with the direct measurement is a sensitive probe of physics beyond the standard model, and possibly of the nature of the Higgs boson itself.

The mass of the \(W\) boson has been measured in proton-antiproton collisions at the Tevatron by the CDF and D0 collaborations with uncertainties of 19 MeV and 23 MeV respectively [2, 3, 4]. The extraction of \(m_{W}\) at the Tevatron experiments exploited the transverse momentum of the charged lepton, \(p_{\rm T}^{\ell}\), the tranverse momentum of the neutrino \(p_{\rm T}^{\nu}\), reconstructed from the combination of the charged lepton and the hadronic recoil, and the transverse mass \(m_{T}\) of the \(W\) boson, defined as \(m_{T}^{2}=2\cdot p_{\rm T}^{\nu}\cdot p_{T}^{\ell}\cdot[1-\cos\Delta\phi(\ell, \nu)]\), where \(\Delta\phi(\ell,\nu)\) is the angle between the lepton and the neutrino in the transverse plane.

The measurement of \(p_{\rm T}^{\nu}\) and \(m_{T}\) at the LHC is likely to be affected by larger experimental systematic uncertainties, due to the high pile-up of proton-proton interactions, which degrades the resolution of the measurement of the hadronic recoil. The best experimental precision on the mass of the \(W\) boson might therefore be achieved at the LHC by extracting \(m_{W}\) from the \(p_{\rm T}^{\ell}\) distribution of the charged electron or muon produced in the leptonic decay of the \(W\) boson. However, the \(p_{\rm T}^{\ell}\) distribution is affected by larger theoretical uncertainties than \(m_{T}\), including the uncertainty due to missing higher orders in the perturbative expansion of the strong-coupling constant, \(\alpha_{s}\), uncertainties on the modelling of non-perturbative quantum chromodynamics (QCD) effects, and the uncertainties on parton distribution functions (PDF).

The PDF uncertainties for the extraction of \(m_{W}\) from the \(p_{\rm T}^{\ell}\) distribution in the CDF and D0 measurements are estimated as 9 MeV and 11 MeV respectively, the uncertainties due to the boson \(p_{\rm T}\) modelling are estimated as 9 MeV by CDF and 5 MeV by D0. Such theoretical uncertainties are expected to be larger at a proton-proton collider, like the LHC, than at a proton-antiproton collider [5, 6, 7]. This note focuses on the estimation of the PDF uncertainties and of the uncertainties on the modelling of the low-\(p_{\rm T}\) region of the \(W\)-boson \(p_{\rm T}\) distribution, and how they affect the extraction of \(m_{W}\) from \(p_{\rm T}^{\ell}\) at the LHC. The impact of PDF uncertainties on the \(m_{W}\) extraction from \(m_{T}\) has been studied elsewhere [8, 9].

Other theoretical uncertainties are expected to have a significant contribution for the measurement of the mass of the \(W\) boson at the LHC, but they are not addressed in this study. They include uncertainties related to the quantum electrodynamic radiation of photons from the final-state electrons and muons, parametric uncertainties in the choice of the strong-coupling constant at the mass of the \(Z\) boson, \(\alpha_{s}(m_{Z})\), and of the width of the \(W\) boson, \(\Gamma_{W}\), and uncertainties due to missing higher orders in the perturbative expansion of \(\alpha_{s}\).

## 2 Theoretical predictions and PDF uncertainties

The estimation of PDF uncertainties on the extraction of \(m_{W}\) from \(p_{\rm T}^{\ell}\) is based on a QCD prediction obtained by combining calculations performed with MCFM [10] version 6.8, and CuTe [11] version 1.1.0. This combined prediction is interfaced to APPLGRID [12] version 1.4.69, and the various PDF sets are accessed by mean of LHAPDF [13] version 6.1.3. The CuTe package allows the evaluation of the resummed prediction of the \(W\)-boson \(p_{\rm T}\) spectrum at next-to-next-to-leading logarithmic (NNLL) order in the expansion of the strong-coupling constant, including NLO matching corrections. However the calculation is performed by CuTe in the zero-width approximation, and without including the decay of the \(W\) boson. MCFM is a fixed order prediction, which includes the \(W\)-boson decay with all spin correlations, but is divergent in the low-\(p_{\rm T}\) limit of the \(W\) boson. The two predictions are combined by applying an event-by-event weight to the MCFM prediction as a function of the \(W\)-boson \(p_{\rm T}\), with the weight defined as the ratio of the resummed prediction over the fixed order prediction, both calculated with CuTe. In both MCFM and CuTe calculations, the electroweak parameters are set according to the \(G_{\mu}\)-scheme: the mass of the \(W\) boson, the mass of the \(Z\) boson, \(m_{Z}\), and the Fermi constant, \(G_{F}\), are used as input parameters, the fine-structure constant at the scale of the \(Z\) boson mass, \(\alpha(m_{Z})\), and the weak mixing angle, \(\theta_{W}\), are calculated from their tree-level relations. The input parameters \(m_{Z}\) and \(G_{F}\) are set to the values \(m_{Z}=91.1876\) GeV and \(G_{F}=1.1663787\times 10^{-5}\) GeV\({}^{-2}\)[14], \(m_{W}\) is fixed to the world average \(m_{W}=80385\) MeV, or varied to simulate the extraction of the \(W\)-boson mass. The values of the Cabibbo Kobayashi Maskawa (CKM) matrix are set to \(V_{ud}=0.97427\), \(V_{us}=0.22534\), \(V_{ub}=0.00351\), \(V_{cd}=0.22520\), \(V_{cs}=0.97344\), and \(V_{cb}=0.0412\)[14], whereas \(V_{td}\), \(V_{ts}\) and \(V_{tb}\) are set to 0 to exclude the associated production of a \(W\) boson and top quark, which would be evaluated in the top quark massless approximation by the MCFM and CuTe predictions.

Fixed order predictions are evaluated at NLO, which corresponds to order O(\(\alpha_{s}\)) in the expansion of the strong-coupling constant, with the factorisation and renormalisation scales set to \(\mu=80\) GeV. Figure 1 shows the comparison between the CuTe and MCFM predictions at NLO (fixed order) for the transverse momentum spectrum of the \(W\) boson, \(p_{\rm T}^{W}\), for \(W^{+}\) and \(W^{-}\) production, in the zero-width approximation for the \(W\)-boson propagator. The two calculations are in perfect agreement, as expected, for the central prediction and for the PDF uncertainties. The resummed prediction of the \(W\)-boson \(p_{\rm T}\) spectrum at NNLL, including next-to-leading order (NLO) matching corrections, and henceforth referred to as NLO+NNLL, is calculated with CuTe. An improved resummation scheme is used, in which the factorisation scale \(\mu\) is set to \(\mu=q^{*}+q_{T}\), where the non-perturbative scale \(q^{*}\) protects the processes from receiving large long-distance hadronic contributions, thus it allows the perturbative prediction of the \(p_{\rm T}^{W}\) spectrum to be valid also in the limit of vanishing transverse momentum of the vector boson. The non-perturbative scale \(q^{*}\) is generated dynamically, and set to \(q^{*}\sim m_{V}e^{-C/\alpha_{s}(m_{V})}\), where \(m_{V}\) is the

mass of the vector boson \(W\) or \(Z\), and \(C\) is a constant which includes the colour factor of the boson [11]. In the case of \(W\)-boson production, and for \(\alpha_{s}(m_{Z})=0.118\), \(q^{*}\) is approximately 1.82. Long-distance corrections are modelled in CuTe using a gaussian form factor, the scale of which is set by a non-perturbative parameter \(\Lambda_{\rm NP}\). The value of \(\Lambda_{\rm NP}=0.6\) is used in the calculation, which was found to provide a good description of the Tevatron measurements of the \(Z\)-boson \(p_{\rm T}\)[15, 16, 17, 18], to which \(\Lambda_{\rm NP}\) was tuned [11], and a reasonable description of the more recent LHC measurements [19].

The MCFM predictions are reweighted to reproduce the transverse momentum distribution of the \(W\) boson as predicted by CuTe at NLO+NNLL. Reweighting functions, differential in \(p_{\rm T}^{W}\), are defined as the ratio of the NLO+NNLL resummed predictions to the NLO fixed order predictions. Figure 2 shows the comparison of the NLO predictions, with renormalisation and factorisation scales set to \(m_{W}\), and the NLO+NNLL predictions, with factorisation scale set to \(\mu=q^{*}+q_{T}\), both evaluated with CuTe, and the reweighting functions for \(W^{+}\) and \(W^{-}\), using the CT10nlo PDF set [20]. The ratio between resummed and fixed order predictions has a significant dependence on the flavour of the quarks initiating the \(W\)-boson production process: heavy quarks result in a harder \(p_{\rm T}^{W}\) spectrum and a harder ratio between resummed and fixed order predictions. In order to account for such an effect in the estimation of the PDF uncertainties, the reweighting function is decomposed in terms of the CKM matrix. Six times two reweighting functions \(r_{xy}^{\pm}(p_{\rm T}^{W^{*}})\), with \(xy=ud,us,ub,cd,cs,cb\), corresponding to the various elements of the CKM matrix, are evaluated for \(W^{+}\) and \(W^{-}\) production by setting to zero all the other elements. These reweighting functions are shown in Fig. 3. The MCFM prediction is decomposed into subprocesses, and each subprocess reweighted with the corresponding CKM weight, according to Tabs. 1 and 2. As shown in the tables, all the NLO subprocesses are accounted in the prediction, including the gluon-initiated production, which is treated consistently at NLO both in the partonic cross sections and in the PDF evolution.

The CuTe NLO+NNLL predictions and the MCFM reweighted predictions for \(W^{+}\) and \(W^{-}\) production are compared in Fig. 4. The reweighted MCFM prediction reproduce the CuTe calculation within 0.2%. The PDF uncertainties are very well reproduced at high \(p_{\rm T}\) above approximately 10, whereas in the low-\(p_{\rm T}\) region the CuTe prediction has larger PDF uncertainties. In CuTe the factorisation scale is set to \(\mu=q^{*}+q_{T}\), with \(q^{*}\sim 1.82\), as a consequence the CuTe prediction is sensitive to the larger PDF uncertainties associated with the low Bjorken-x region. In contrast, in the MCFM prediction, the factorisation scale is set to 80, and the reweighted MCFM prediction cannot fully reproduce the PDF uncertainties of the resummed prediction.

## 3 Event selection and methodology for the extraction of the \(W\)-boson mass

Events are selected with a central lepton \(|\eta^{\ell}|<2.4\), transverse mass \(m_{T}>60\) GeV, and \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\nu}>30\) GeV, the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\ell}\) distribution is considered in the range \(30<p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\ell}<50\) GeV, and binned in 40 equally spaced bins of 0.5 GeV. The range of \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\ell}\) used for extraction of \(m_{W}\) is not optimised, and the estimation of theoretical uncertainties may vary depending on the choice of such range. The optimal range of \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\ell}\) for the \(m_{W}\) measurement should take into account the various experimental uncertainties, namely background, lepton reconstruction, identification, and trigger efficiencies, and energy scale and resolution. It should also take into account all the relevant theoretical uncertainties.

The impact of PDF uncertainties on the measurement of the \(W\)-boson mass can be significantly reduced by considering normalised differential distributions, so as to cancel the PDF uncertainties on the \(W\)-boson inclusive cross section. In order to reduce the impact of PDF uncertainties the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\ell}\) distributions are normalised to unitary integral. The expected statistical uncertainty corresponding to 5 fb\({}^{-1}\) of integrated luminosity, and assuming no efficiency loss, is assigned to each bin of the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\ell}\) spectrum. Such an uncertainty is approximately 0.16%(0.19%) near the Jacobian peak, and approximately 0.5%(0.6%) at 50 GeV for \(W^{+}(W^{-})\) production. Systematic experimental uncertainties are not considered in this study, but they are expected to have a small impact on the estimation of the PDF uncertainties. To determine the value of the \(W\)-boson mass, a \(\chi^{2}\) profile as a function of \(m_{W}\) is evaluated by comparing a reference \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\ell}\) distribution with fixed \(m_{W}\) to a set of test \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\ell}\) distributions calculated with various \(m_{W}\). The reference \(W\)-boson mass \(m_{W}^{\mathrm{ref}}\) is fixed to the world average \(m_{W}=80385\) MeV [14], the test samples are calculated in a range of \(\pm 100\) MeV in steps of 2 MeV. In \(pp\) collisions, the \(W^{+}\) and \(W^{-}\) production are in general affected by different PDF uncertainties. In view of such a difference, a charge dependent analysis is expected to reduce the PDF uncertainties on the extraction of \(m_{W}\) from \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\ell}\)[7]. For this reason the \(\chi^{2}\) profiles used to estimate the PDF uncertainties are evaluated separately for the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\ell}\) spectrum from \(W^{+}\) decay and from \(W^{-}\) decay, and using both \(W^{+}\) and \(W^{-}\) and \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\ell}\) spectra. Figure 7 shows an example of \(\chi^{2}\) profiles for \(W^{+}\), \(W^{-}\) and \(W^{+}\) and \(W^{-}\) together. The \(\chi^{2}\) profile is fitted with a parabolic function, the value of \(m_{W}\) which minimise the \(\chi^{2}\) function corresponds to the result of the \(m_{W}\) extraction. The total expected statistical uncertainty on \(m_{W}\), for the 2011 dataset, is below 5 MeV, as shown Fig. 7, and is

close to 2 MeV for the 2012 dataset.

## 4 Polarisation of the \(W\) boson and PDF uncertainties

An important source of uncertainty for the extraction of \(m_{W}\) from the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\ell}\) spectrum is related to the uncertainty on the average polarisation of the \(W\) boson. In this study, the polarisation of the \(W\) boson is simulated at NLO. For the sake of simplicity, the production of \(W\) bosons by \(u\) and \(d\) quarks at leading order (LO) in the strong-coupling expansion, at a given rapidity \(y\), can be decomposed into two terms corresponding to opposite helicity states \(\lambda=\pm 1\):

\[\sigma_{W^{*}}(y) \propto u(x_{1})\cdot\bar{d}(x_{2})+\bar{d}(x_{1})\cdot u(x_{2}) \tag{1}\] \[\sigma_{W^{-}}(y) \propto d(x_{1})\cdot\bar{u}(x_{2})+\bar{u}(x_{1})\cdot d(x_{2}) \tag{2}\]

where \(x_{1,2}=\frac{m_{W}}{\sqrt{s}}\cdot e^{\pm y}\). At central rapidity \(y=0\), \(x_{1}\) is equal to \(x_{2}\), and the two terms contribute equally, leading on average to the same amount of positive and negative helicity states and to unpolarised \(W\)-boson production, whereas for \(y\neq 0\), the two terms give different contributions, and the \(W\) bosons are polarised on average. At NLO, in addition to the \(\lambda=\pm 1\) states, the \(W\) boson can be also in the \(\lambda=0\) helicity state. The three helicity states are shown schematically in Fig. 8 (a). The \(\lambda=+1,-1\), and 0 helicity states correspond to different distribution of the polar angle \(\theta^{*}\) between the direction of the momentum of the incoming quark in the laboratory frame, assumed to be parallel to the beam axis, and the direction of the leptons momenta in the \(W\)-boson rest frame, as shown in Fig. 8 (b).

As shown in Eqs. 1 and 2, the amount of positive and negative helicity states depends on the \(u\) and \(d\) PDF. As a consequence, the uncertainty in the \(u\) and \(d\) valence and sea PDF determines an uncertainty

Figure 8: (a) Schematic representation of the \(W\)-boson helicity states, with the leptons depicted in the \(W\)-boson rest frame, and (b) corresponding \(\cos\theta^{*}\) spectra, shown for the individual helicity states and combinations thereof.

in the average \(W\)-boson polarisation, which in turns propagates into an uncertainty on the \(p_{\rm T}^{\ell}\) spectrum. In order to isolate the effect of the incomplete knowledge of the \(W\)-boson average polarisation on the measurement of \(m_{W}\), the \(W\)-boson production is restricted to only vertices involving \(u\) and \(d\) quark, by setting all the terms of the CKM matrix to zero except for \(V_{ud}\). Three different samples are produced, the first sample has the usual amount of +1, -1, and 0 helicity states as evaluated by the MCFM+CuTe prediction, a second sample with equal amount of +1 and -1 helicity states is obtained by applying a random sign flip to the lepton momenta in the \(W\)-boson rest frame, and a third sample, in which the spin correlations in the \(W\)-boson decay are turned off, is obtained by picking a random axis for the lepton directions in the \(W\)-boson rest frame. Figure 9 shows the \(\cos\theta^{*}\) distribution in the \(W\)-boson rest frame, for the three samples, where the angle \(\theta^{*}\) is defined by choosing the positive direction of the \(z\) axis according to the \(W\)-boson rapidity: \(\cos\theta^{*}=\cos(\vec{\ell},\vec{z}\cdot{\rm sgn}\,y_{W})\).

Figure 10 shows the comparison of the PDF uncertainties of the samples with usual spin correlations and without spin correlations on the \(p_{\rm T}^{\ell}\) spectrum for \(W^{+}\) and \(W^{-}\). In the sample without spin correlations, PDF variations do not change the average polarisation of the \(W\) boson, and therefore the \(p_{\rm T}^{\ell}\) spectrum shows much smaller PDF uncertainties. Fig. 11 shows the corresponding PDF uncertainties for the extraction of \(m_{W}\) from \(p_{\rm T}^{\ell}\) for \(W^{+}\), \(W^{-}\), and \(W^{+}\) and \(W^{-}\) together. Each bin corresponds to the value of \(m_{W}\), extracted from a parabolic fit of the \(\chi^{2}\) profile as a function of \(m_{W}\), using one of the 30 variations of the dedicated PDF set, MW-NLO, with the set of test \(p_{\rm T}^{\ell}\) distributions calculated with different \(m_{W}\), and with the central PDF in the reference \(p_{\rm T}^{\ell}\) distribution with fixed \(m_{W}\). For each of the three samples, the value of \(m_{W}\), and the PDF uncertainties evaluated with the hessian method, are shown. The PDF uncertainties for \(W^{+}\) (\(W^{-}\)) production are a the level of 3 (6) MeV for the unpolarised sample, and

Figure 9: Differential cross sections as a function of \(\cos\theta^{*}\) for (a) \(W^{+}\), and (b) \(W^{-}\) production. Predictions from the three samples without spin correlations, equal amount of positive and negative helicity states, and usual spin correlations, are compared. The dashed bands show the PDF uncertainties of the CT10nlo PDF set.

they grow up to approximately 20 (30) \(\mathrm{Me\kern-1.0ptV}\) in the sample with usual spin correlations. The combined minimisation of \(W^{+}\) and \(W^{-}\)\(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\ell}\) spectra helps to reduce the PDF uncertainties for the sample with usual spin correlations at the level of approximately 15 \(\mathrm{Me\kern-1.0ptV}\). For the \(W^{+}\) production, a quite large increase of the uncertainty when going from the unpolarised sample to the sample with usual spin correlations, at the level of 15 \(\mathrm{Me\kern-1.0ptV}\), is observed for the PDF members 29 and 30. These two sets correspond to opposite variations of the strange-quark PDF to the \(\bar{d}\) PDF ratio. This effect is due to the specific choice of PDF parametrisation, where, the strange-quark PDF is parametrised as a fraction of the \(\bar{d}\) PDF, and variations of the relative amount of sea and valence \(d\) PDF change the average polarisation of the \(W\)-boson. For the \(W^{-}\) production, the uncertainty on the valence \(d\) PDF has a larger impact on the uncertainty on the average polarisation, and this results in an increase of the uncertainty related to several eigenvector variations. Figure 12 shows the relative PDF uncertainty for the ratio of the valence \(d_{V}\) PDF at the mass of the \(W\) boson. The experimental PDF uncertainty dominates the PDF uncertainty corresponding to model variations in the region below approximately \(x=0.01\). In the medium and high \(x\) region, model variations give a significant contribution to the total PDF uncertainty, and a large amount is due to the variations of the ratio of the strange-quark PDF over the \(\bar{d}\) PDF, corresponding to \(r_{s}=0.72\) and \(r_{s}=1.25\).

## 5 Charm-initiated \(W\)-boson production and PDF uncertainties

An additional source of uncertainty for the measurement of the \(W\)-boson mass from \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\ell}\) is related to the presence of a charm quark in the initial state of the \(W\)-boson production. When the \(W\) boson is produced via vertices involving a charm quark in the initial state, the mass of the charm, which is of the order of 1 \(\mathrm{Ge\kern-1.0ptV}\), modifies the kinematic of the \(W\)-boson production, and originates a harder \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{W}\) spectrum. The effect is shown in Fig. 13, where the \(W\)-boson \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) spectra of three different setup are compared. In the first setup, labeled \(V_{ud}\), all the values of the CKM matrix are set to zero except for \(V_{ud}\), in the second

setup, labeled \(V_{ud}\) and \(V_{cs}\), all the entries of the CKM matrix are set to zero except for \(V_{ud}\) and \(V_{cs}\), and in the third setup, labeled \(V_{cs}\), only \(V_{cs}\) is kept as non-zero. In the \(V_{ud}\) setup the \(W\) boson is produced only via vertices involving \(u\) and \(d\) quarks, in the \(V_{cs}\) setup the \(W\) boson is produced only via vertices involving charm and strange quarks, in the \(V_{ud}\) and \(V_{cs}\) setup both production modes are included. The incomplete knowledge of the PDF, in particular of the strange-quark PDF, determines an uncertainty on the relative fraction of charm-initiated \(W\)-boson production, and, as a consequence, an uncertainty on the \(p_{\rm T}^{W}\) spectrum. Moreover, the amount of charm-initiated \(W\)-boson production will alter the balance between valence quark initiated and sea quark initiated production, which in turns affect the \(W\)-boson average polarisation and the \(p_{\rm T}^{\ell}\) spectrum. In order to isolate the effect of the charm-initiated production on the \(m_{W}\) measurement, a sample in which the spin correlations in the \(W\)-boson decay are turned off by picking a random axis for the lepton directions in the \(W\)-boson rest frame, is used. The comparison of the PDF uncertainties between the the \(V_{ud}\) setup and the \(V_{ud}\) and \(V_{cs}\) setup, gives an estimate of the effect of the charm-initiated \(W\)-boson production. Figure 14 shows the comparison of the PDF uncertainties for the \(V_{ud}\) setup and the \(V_{ud}\) and \(V_{cs}\) setup on the \(p_{\rm T}^{\ell}\) spectrum for \(W^{+}\) and \(W^{-}\), the \(V_{ud}\) setup has a significantly smaller PDF uncertainties. Figure 15 shows the PDF uncertainties for the extraction of \(m_{W}\) from \(p_{\rm T}^{\ell}\) for \(W^{+}\), \(W^{-}\), and \(W^{+}\) and \(W^{-}\) together, for the \(V_{ud}\) setup and for the \(V_{ud}\) and \(V_{cs}\) setup. The PDF members 29 and 30 correspond to opposite variations of the strange-quark PDF to the \(\bar{d}\) PDF ratio. As expected, there is a significant increase of the impact of the strange-quark PDF uncertainty on the \(m_{W}\) extraction once the charm-initiated processes are included. The PDF uncertainties for \(W^{+}\) (\(W^{-}\)) production are a the level of 3 (6) for the \(V_{ud}\) setup, and they grow up to approximately 8 (10) for the \(V_{ud}\) and \(V_{cs}\) setup. However, the increase in \(m_{W}\) uncertainty is opposite in sign with respect to the uncertainty induced by strange-quark PDF variations in a sample with spin correlations, as shown in Fig. 11. Hence there is a partial cancellation between the effect of the \(W\)-boson polarisation and of the charm-initiated production on the impact of the strange-quark PDF uncertainty, but such a cancellation

## 6 Detector effects and summary of PDF uncertainties

The theoretical uncertainties for the extraction of the \(W\)-boson mass from the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\ell}\) spectrum are affected by detector effects, notably resolution and reconstruction efficiency. In order to account for such effects, the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\ell}\) spectrum is smeared, according to the results published in Ref. [28], so as to simulate the experimental resolution on the transverse momentum of muons, \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mu}\), of the ATLAS detector. It is assumed that the measurement of the transverse momentum of the muons is based only on the information from the Inner Detector (ID). The resolution terms describe the multiple scattering contribution, and the intrinsic resolution caused by the imperfect knowledge of the magnetic field in the ID, by the spatial resolution of the detector components, and by any residual misalignment of the detector components. The measured muon momentum resolution in the considered \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) range depends largely on the residual internal misalignments of the ID. Additional constraints were introduced into the alignment procedure for the 2011 data, leading to a significant improvement in the observed resolution [28]. Hence, the result presented in this note should be considered as conservative. The electron energy resolution is comparable to the muon momentum resolution, and the detector effects on the theoretical uncertainties for the measurement of \(m_{W}\) from the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\ell}\) spectrum in the electron channel are expected to be similar than in the muon channel.

The reconstruction efficiency as a function of lepton \(\eta\) is rather uniform, and is not expected to affect the theoretical uncertainties for the extraction of \(m_{W}\). The resolution of the hadronic recoil affects the measurement of the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\ell}\) spectrum only through the event selection requirements on the missing transverse

The shifts account for all the effects of \(W\)-boson polarisation and charm-initiated processes considered in this study. The uncertainties for \(W^{+}\), \(W^{-}\), and \(W^{+}\) and \(W^{-}\) production are compared. The total PDF uncertainties, evaluated as the sum in quadrature of positive and negative shifts, are shown in.

momentum and on the transverse mass, such effects are expected to be small.

Figure 17 shows the effect of the smearing on the statistical uncertainty and on the PDF uncertainties. The statistical uncertainty increases of approximately 10%, and a similar increase is observed in the PDF uncertainties. The fitted value is changing only marginally.

Using the same framework, the PDF uncertainties for the CT10nlo, MSTW2008CPdeutnlo, and NNPDF30_nlo_as_118 PDF sets are estimated and compared to the uncertainties of the MW-NLO PDF set used in this study. The PDF uncertainties for the extraction of \(m_{W}\) from \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\ell}\) are evaluated using the sample with usual spin correlations, with all the relevant terms of the CKM matrix, and after applying the muon \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) smearing. The CT10nlo PDF uncertainties are scaled to 68% confidence level, results are shown in Tab. 3.

The \(u\) valence and \(d\) valence PDF uncertainties at the scale of \(W\)-boson mass of the considered PDF sets are shown in Fig. 18. The MW-NLO PDF set has smaller uncertainties than the other PDF sets for the \(u\) valence PDF, which is due to the limited number of free parameters in the choice of the PDF parametrisation.

The uncertainties evaluated with the CT10nlo PDF set, and rescaled to 68% confidence level, are at the level of 15 MeV, slightly larger than those of the MW-NLO PDF set. The uncertainties of the MSTW2008CPdeutnlo and NNPDF30_nlo_as_118 set are smaller, at the level of 7 MeV and 6 MeV respectively. In order to test the compatibility between different PDF sets for the extraction of \(m_{W}\) from \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\ell}\), the CT10nlo PDF set is used for the reference \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\ell}\) spectrum with fixed value of \(m_{W}=80385\) MeV, and a different PDF set is used for the test \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\ell}\) distributions calculated with various \(m_{W}\). Table 4 shows the difference between the input value of \(m_{W}=80385\) MeV and the extracted \(m_{W}\), for the various PDF sets.

The MW-NLO PDF set shows a larger difference with respect to the other PDF sets in \(W^{-}\) production, at the level of 50 MeV. Larger uncertainties for \(W^{-}\) production are expected, and observed in Tab. 3, from such a PDF set, since only HERA I data are used to extract it, which has better constrain on the \(u\) valence PDF rather than on the \(d\) valence PDF. This large shift should not be considered as a realistic estimate of PDF uncertainties, since additional measurements from the Tevatron and the LHC, which provide further

constraints on the \(d\) valence PDF, are already considered in the other PDF sets. As shown in the last row of Tab. 4, the combined analysis of \(W^{+}\) and \(W^{-}\)\(p_{\rm T}^{\ell}\) distributions helps to reduce the differences in the extracted value of \(m_{W}\) between the various PDF set.

Parton shower uncertainties

Within the parton shower model, the transverse momentum distribution of vector bosons is induced by the emission of multiple gluons in the initial state, when the incoming partons evolve up to a scale typical of \(W\) or \(Z\) production. The resulting distributions are affected by uncertainties in the perturbative and non-perturbative mechanisms describing the shower evolution. The estimation of these uncertainties is complementary and related to the study of PDF uncertainties described above.

In Ref. [29], the precisely measured \(Z\)-boson transverse momentum distribution is used to determine the parton shower parameters of two Monte Carlo predictions, based respectively on the Pythia8 generator [30] used standalone, and on a setup combining the Powheg NLO matrix element generator [31] with Pythia8 for the parton shower. Assuming universality of the QCD radiation effects involved in \(Z\)- and \(W\)-boson production, the parton shower parameters estimated from the measurement of the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{Z}\) distribution can be used to predict the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{W}\) distribution. The aim of this section to quantify the uncertainty in the determination of \(m_{W}\) arising from the residual uncertainty in the parton shower parameters, under these assumptions.

An accurate modelling of \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{Z}\) was obtained by tuning three parton shower parameters in the Pythia8 setup, and two in the Powheg\(+\)Pythia8 setup. The tuned parameters include \(p_{\mathrm{T0}}\), \(k_{\mathrm{T}}\) and \(\alpha_{\mathrm{s}}^{\mathrm{ISR}}(m_{Z})\), which represent the parton shower lower cut-off in the non-perturbative regime, the primordial transverse momentum of the partons initiating the hard scattering process, and the strong-coupling constant value assumed for the initial-state radiation (ISR). This last parameter is left free only in the Pythia8 setup, while it is constrained to the value assumed for the NLO cross section calculation in Powheg\(+\)Pythia8. The resulting tuned parameter sets are referred to as AZ for Pythia8 and AZNLO for Powheg\(+\)Pythia8. Table 5 shows the tuned parameters values compared to the default tune used in Pythia8, 4C. The AZ tune has been compared to the data for different \(Z\)-boson rapidity regions, and the good agreement observed between predicted and measured \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{Z}\) distributions supports the validity of a single tune in a wide Bjorken \(x\)-range.

The AZ tune is used to propagate the uncertainties on the parton shower parameters computed from \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{Z}\) to the measurement of \(m_{W}\). Three tuning eigenvectors and a pair of sets of parton shower parameters associated with each eigenvector are extracted from the correlation between the tuned variables. Each pair corresponds to positive and negative 68% CL exclusion along the eigenvector. The different sets are referred to as \(1+\), \(1-\), \(2+\), \(2-\), \(3+\) and \(3-\). Figure 19 shows the distortion of the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mu}\) distribution due to the tune variations. These distributions are computed at the detector level, and reweighted with respect to the parton shower parameter variations at the particle level. The muon channel was used in this study; the electron channel is expected to behave similarly.

These variations were used to generate samples of \(W\) events, which are treated as data in the mass fits. An event selection identical to the one shown in section 3 was applied, and the same fitting procedure is used. The fits are performed comparing the distributions obtained above to a set of templates built by varying the mass in steps of 0.02% within 0.5% of the reference mass value and assuming the central AZ

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{l c c c} \hline Tune & AZ & AZNLO & 4C \\ \hline \hline Primordial \(k_{\mathrm{T}}\) [GeV] & \(1.71\pm 0.03\) & \(1.75\pm 0.03\) & 2.0 \\ \(\alpha_{\mathrm{s}}^{\mathrm{ISR}}(m_{Z})\) & \(0.1237\pm 0.0002\) & \(0.118\) (fixed) & 0.137 \\ ISR cut-off [GeV] & \(0.59\pm 0.08\) & \(1.92\pm 0.12\) & 2.0 \\ \hline \(\chi^{2}_{\mathrm{min}}\)/dof & 45.4/32 & 46.0/33 & - \\ \hline \end{tabular}

tune. The obtained differences with respect to the reference mass define the parton shower uncertainty. The uncertainties are evaluated with the hessian method, such that the positive (negative) uncertainty is the quadratic sum of positive (negative) biased with respect to the reference value of \(m_{W}\)[27]. The total uncertainties amount to \(+5\) and \(-7\) MeV, and are reported in Table 6.

One should stress that this uncertainty only covers the contribution of the parton shower parameters, while the \(p_{T}^{W}\) distribution is affected by additional uncertainties coming from the different quark flavour contributions to \(Z\)- and \(W\)-boson production. Figure 20 shows the expected \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{Z}\) and \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{W}\) distributions for different initial parton flavours. To illustrate the potential impact of PDF uncertainties, consider the example of the b quarks: any mis-modeling of the b-quark fraction in \(Z\) production generates a distortion in the predicted \(p_{T}^{Z}\) distribution; this distortion is absorbed in the fitted parton shower parameters, and hence propagated to the \(p_{T}^{W}\) prediction, although the b-quark contribution to \(W\) production is negligible. PDF uncertainties on the parton shower fit are not considered in the current estimation; only the experimental uncertainty of the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{Z}\) measurement is propagated, _via_ the fitted parton shower parameters, to the \(W\)-boson mass measurement. A more consistent procedure would involve a simultaneous fit of the PDF and parton shower parameters, which has not been attempted yet. The present estimate should thus be considered a first step in the derivation of a consistent set of PDF and parton shower parameters to describe \(W\)- and \(Z\)-boson production at the LHC.

Conclusions

A quantitative study of the theoretical uncertainties for the extraction of \(m_{W}\) from the \(p_{\rm T}^{\ell}\) spectrum due to the incomplete knowledge of the quark PDF, and to the uncertainties on the modelling of the low-\(p_{\rm T}\) region of \(W\!/Z\) bosons, has been performed. The uncertainties on the \(W\)-boson polarisation are confirmed as potentially important source of uncertainties on the mass measurement. The charm-initiated processes also constitute a significant source of uncertainties, related to the incomplete knowledge of the strange-quark PDF. However, in the considered model, the impact of the strange-quark PDF uncertainty on the \(W\)-boson mass due to the charm-initiated processes partially cancel the effect of the strange-quark PDF on the \(W\) polarisation. For a complete assessment of theoretical uncertainties for the measurement of the \(W\)-boson mass, it is important to include NNLO order QCD and NLO electroweak corrections, to include other sources of theoretical uncertainties not considered in this study, and to address the interplay between the various sources of theoretical uncertainties.
