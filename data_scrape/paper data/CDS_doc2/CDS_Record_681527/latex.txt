## Chapter 1 Introduction

Particle physicists have found that they can describe the fundamental structure and behavior of matter within a theoretical framework called the Standard Model (SM). This model incorporates all the known particles and the forces through which they interact, with the exception of gravity. However there are still many questions, which are not answered in the framework of the SM. And even inside the SM, there are two major points which have not been clarified yet: the origin of the spontaneous symmetry breaking in the electroweak sector of the SM, which implies the existence of the not yet discovered Higgs boson, and the origin of the violation of CP symmetry[1],[2].

The LEP (Large Electron Positron collider) experimental program has confirmed the validity of the Standard Model up to energies of about 200 GeV. However, LEP experiments could not answer the question which is fundamental for the Standard Model to be self-consistent, the existence of the Higgs boson. Besides that, possible super-symmetry extensions of the SM, which predict a spectrum of new particles with masses higher than 200 GeV, or theories that go beyond the Standard Model which predict the discovery of new physics at the TeV energy scale, as the existence of new neutral, Z', or changed W' vector gauge boson with a mass about few TeV, require new experiments to be investigated [3].

The LHC (Large Hadron Collider) is designed to reach this high energy region and it will be built at CERN using the past LEP tunnel (27 \(Km\) circumference). It will be a proton-proton collider, hence the synchrotron radiation that limits the energy in an electron-positron circular collider such as LEP, will not be a significant problem. The collision energy will be about 14 TeV using magnetic fields of about 9 Tesla generated

the absolute energy calibration of the Tile Calorimeter. The main goal of this work is to quantitatively compare test beam and source data taken on TileCal production modules, in order to understand better the calorimeter calibration procedure.

This work is organized as follow: in Chapter 2 the ATLAS detector is described. The hadronic calorimeter, TileCal, is covered in Chapter 3. In Chapter 4 the calibration of the Tile Calorimeter detector, with emphasis on the Testbeam set-up, is reviewed. In the Chapter 5, the module responses to the radioactive source and beam particles are shown and latter compared to each other in Chapter 6. A study of the propagation of the calibration constants using cesium constants is carried out. Summary and conclusions are given in Chapter 7.

## Chapter 2 ATLAS detector for the LHC.

ATLAS is a general-purpose experiment for studing proton-proton collisions at LHC [5]. The detector design has been optimized to cover the largest possible range of LHC physics: search for Higgs bosons and alternative schemes for the spontaneous symmetry-breaking mechanism; searches for supersymmetry particles, new gauge boson, leptoquarks, and quarks and leptons compositeness indicating extensions to the Standard Model and new physics beyond it[6]; studies of the origin of CP violation via high-precision measurements of CP-violating B-decays; high-precision measurements of the third quark family such as the top-quark mass and decay properties, rare decay of B-hadrons, spectroscopy of the rare B-hadrons, and B\({}^{0}_{s}\)-mixing [7].

### 2.1 ATLAS: The overall detector concept

The design of ATLAS and the other LHC detectors is driven by the need to select the "interesting" events from the \(\sim 10^{9}\) interactions/second that will take place at the design luminosity. Besides being able to trigger on such events, the detector must measure the relevant kinematic quantities with sufficient precision to achieve the required rejection power against the expected backgrounds. A special case is "pile-up", which are soft collision that will produce non-negligible occupancies in all detectors: for each bunch crossing, on average 23 such interactions will take place, which imposes strong requirements to the design and performance of the LHC detectors. They must be rather fast (response \(<50\ ns\)) and highly granular to minimize the contribution of pile-up in a given detector cell. Also, the detectors have to be resistant enough to work in a high-radiation environment, due to high fluxes of particles resulting from the \(pp\) interactions at givenenergy and luminosity.

The ATLAS detector has been designed to have very good electromagnetic calorimetry for \(e\),\(\gamma\) identification and measurement, close to hermetic jet and \(E_{T}^{miss}\) calorimetry, efficient tracking at high luminosity for lepton measurements, \(b\) quark tagging and enhanced \(e\),\(\gamma\) identification, \(\tau\) and heavy flavor vertexing and reconstruction capability of some \(B\) decays and a low \(p_{T}\) thresholds for the trigger.

The main design features of ATLAS are a large air-core toroid system used as a muon spectrometer, the liquid-argon technique for the electromagnetic and end-cap hadronic calorimeters, iron-scintillator hadronic calorimetry in the barrel, a superconducting solenoid as the tracker magnet, semiconductor detectors in the inner-tracking system and straw-tubes in the outer tracker part.

The overall layout of ATLAS detector is shown in the figure 2.1. The whole detector consists of four systems: the Magnet system, the Inner detector, the Calorimetry and the Muon spectrometer.

The magnet configuration is based on an inner superconducting solenoid around the inner detector cavity, and large superconducting air-core toroids consisting of independent coils arranged with an eight-fold symmetry outside the calorimetry. This configuration offers a high-resolution, large-acceptance and robust performance of the muon spectrometer.

The inner detector is contained within a cylinder of 6.80 \(m\) length and 1.15 \(m\) radius (acceptance in the pseudorapidity1 range \(|\eta|<2.5\)), in a magnetic field of 2 \(T\). Thanks to a combination of discrete high resolution pixel and strip detectors in the inner part and continuous straw-tube tracking detectors with Transition Radiation Tracker (TRT) capability in the outer part of the detector volume, pattern recognition, momentum and vertex measurements with high efficiency, and electron identification are achieved.

Footnote 1: The variable \(\eta\) is called pseudo-rapidity and is related with the angle \(\theta\) between the particle and the \(z\) axis, which coincides with the direction of one of the beams, by the following expression: \(\eta\equiv-\ln\tan(\frac{\theta}{2})\)

The electromagnetic calorimeter is a highly granular lead liquid-Argon (LAr) detector with accordion geometry. The electromagnetic sampling calorimetry has a good performance in terms of energy and position resolutions, covering the pseudo-rapidity range \(|\eta|<3.2\). In the end-caps, the LAr technology is also used for the hadronic calorimeter, sharing the cryostats with the electromagnetic end-caps. The same cryostats also house the LAr forward calorimeters which extend the coverage to \(3.2<|\eta|<4.9\). The bulk of the hadronic calorimetry is provided by a scintillator Tile Calorimeter, TileCal, which is separated into one large barrel and two extended barrel cylinders on each side. The whole calorimeter system contributes to the very good jet and performance of the detector. The LAr calorimetry is contained in a cylinder with an outer radius of 2.25 m and extends to \(\pm 6.65\) m along the beam axis. The outer radius of the tile calorimeter is 4.25 m and its length is \(2\times 6.10\) m. The total weight of the calorimeter system, including the solenoid flux return iron yoke, which is integrated into the tile calorimeter support structure, is about 4000 tons.

The calorimetry system is surrounded by the muon spectrometer. Three stations of high precision tracking chambers with \(\sim 60\)\(\mu m\) intrinsic resolution measure the coordinates of muons bending in the magnetic field. The muon instrumentation is complemented with fast trigger chambers.

Figure 2.1: General and schematic view of the ATLAS detector and its systems.

The combination of all these sub-detectors defines the overall dimensions of the ATLAS detector. The outer chambers of the barrel are at a radius of about 11 \(m\). The length of the barrel toroid coils is \(\pm 13\)\(m\), and the third layer of the forward muon chambers are mounted on separate "wheels" located at \(\pm 21\)\(m\) from the interaction point. The overall weight of the ATLAS detector is of about 7000 tons.

### 2.2 ATLAS calorimetry: description and requirements

The tasks of the calorimeters at hadron colliders consist of an accurate measurement of the energy and detection of electrons and photons, the measurement of the energy and direction of jets and of the missing transverse momentum of the event, and particle identification, for instance, separation of electrons and photons from hadrons and jets, and of \(\tau\) hadronic decays from jets, and event selection at the trigger level.

The ATLAS calorimeter has been designed to meet the diverse demands of the LHC physics program while operating in its very high luminosity environment. Figure 2.2 shows the calorimeter layout. A barrel cryostat around the inner detector cavity contains the barrel electromagnetic calorimeter and the solenoidal coil, which supplies a uniform magnetic field to the inner tracking volume. This coil is placed in front of the electro

magnetic calorimeter. Two end-cap cryostats enclose the electromagnetic and hadronic end-cap calorimeters and the integrated forward calorimeter. The barrel and the extended barrel hadronic calorimeters constitute in an outer support cylinder. Together they form a structure that also acts as the main solenoid flux return, and consists of scintillating tiles and iron absorber plates.

#### The Electromagnetic Calorimeter.

Many important physics processes at the LHC, such as the decay of Higgs bosons into photons or electrons, or the detection of new gauge bosons (Z' or W') decaying to electrons, place stringent requirements on the electromagnetic calorimetry in terms of acceptance, dynamic range, particle identification, energy resolution, and direction measurements.

The electromagnetic calorimeter [8] (figure 2.3) must be able to identify and accurately reconstruct electrons and photons over a wide energy range. The calorimeter uses lead absorbers in a liquid Argon ionization calorimeter and is divided into a barrel part (\(|\eta|<1.475\)) and two end caps (\(1.375<|\eta|<3.2\)), both implemented in an "accordion" geometry.

The longitudinal and transverse segmentation of the electromagnetic calorimeter allows to reconstruct the shower shape and will be an essential tool in rejecting jet back

Figure 2.3: Accordion structure of the electromagnetic calorimeter.

grounds. The segmentation of the electromagnetic calorimeter has been chosen to be \(\Delta\eta\times\Delta\phi\simeq 0.025\times 0.025\) over most of the rapidity coverage. The first sampling has a much finer segmentation and therefore plays the role of a pre-shower device. The barrel part of the electromagnetic calorimeter is preceded by a pre-sampler layer located immediately behind the cryostat inner wall. Measurement from the pre-sampler are used to correct for the energy lost in the material in front of the calorimeter (inner detector, coil, and cryostat) and to assist in measuring \(\eta\) for showers.

#### The Hadronic Calorimeters.

The major goals of the hadronic calorimetry at the LHC are to identify jets and measure their energy and direction, to measure the total missing energy transverse energy \(E_{T}^{miss}\), and to enhance the particle identification.

The requirements on coverage, geometry and performance are the following:

* **Rapidity coverage:** extended to \(|\eta|=5\), for efficient tagging of forward jets and good missing \(p_{T}\) resolution
* **Granularity:**\(\Delta\eta\times\Delta\phi=0.1\times 0.1\) for \(|\eta|<3\) and \(\Delta\eta\times\Delta\phi=0.2\times 0.2\) for larger \(|\eta|\). The longitudinal segmentation is driven by particle identification and 3 samplings are adequate to achieve better energy resolution, via weighting in a non-compensating calorimeter.
* **Energy resolution:** jet energy resolution at different levels in different \(|\eta|\) regions: \(\frac{\Delta E}{E}=\frac{50\%}{\sqrt{E}}\oplus 3\%\) for \(|\eta|<3\) \(\frac{\Delta E}{E}=\frac{100\%}{\sqrt{E}}\oplus 10\%\) for \(3<|\eta|<5\)
* **Energy linearity:** from the study of quark compositeness, the jet energy scale has to be linear within 2% up to a transverse energy of 4 TeV.
* **Total thickness:** for shower containment, both for energy resolution and for reducing the background in the muon chambers, the thickness is of 10 interaction lengths.

The hadronic calorimeter consists of a barrel hadronic calorimeter covering the rapidity region \(|\eta|<1.7\), the hadronic end-cap calorimeter, covering \(1.5<|\eta|<3.2\), and forward calorimeters covering \(3.1<|\eta|<4.9\)

##### The Tile Calorimeter.

TileCal [9] is the central part of the hadronic calorimeter of the ATLAS detector, which covers the range \(|\eta|<1.7\). Its detection principle is based on the sampling technique using iron as absorber material and scintillating plates (tiles) read out by wavelength shifting (WLS) fibers. The tiles are placed in planes perpendicular to the beam axis and staggered in depth, simplifying the mechanical construction and the fiber routing, while providing a rather uniform sampling fraction. The TileCal calorimeter is divided into a barrel and two extended barrel cylinders. An Extended Barrel module is shown in figure 2.4.

From the test beam runs with the electromagnetic and hadronic prototype modules, the obtained pion energy resolution was:

\[\frac{\Delta E}{E}=\frac{(38.3\pm 4.6)\%}{\sqrt{E}}\oplus(1.62\pm 0.29)\% \oplus\frac{(3.06\pm 0.18)\%}{E}\]

Figure 2.4: TileCal extended barrel module constructed at ANL in 2000.

well within the ATLAS specifications for the \(\eta\) region covered by TileCal.

##### The LAr Hadronic Calorimeter system

In the range \(1.5<|\eta|<4.9\) the Liquid Argon Hadronic Calorimeter [8] gradually takes over from TileCal: the end-cap hadronic calorimeter extends to \(|\eta|=3.2\) while the range \(3.1<|\eta|<4.9\) is covered by the high-density forward calorimeter. Both the hadronic end-cap and the forward calorimeters are integrated in the same cryostat housing also the electromagnetic end-caps.

Each hadronic end-cap calorimeter consists of two independent wheels of equal diameter. The first wheel is built out of 25 \(mm\) copper plates, while the second one uses 50 \(mm\) plates; in both wheels the gap between consecutive copper plates is 8.5 \(mm\), and is equipped with 3 electrodes that split it in 4 drift spaces of \(\sim\) 1.8 \(mm\) each. The wheels are divided in two longitudinal read-out segments. The read-out cells are fully pointing in \(\phi\) but only "pseudo-pointing" in \(\eta\). The thickness of the active part of the end-cap calorimeter is \(\sim\) 12 \(\lambda_{abs}\).

In ATLAS the Forward Calorimeter [8] is integrated in the end-cap cryostat (see figure 2.5), with the front face at about 5 \(m\) from the interaction point. The forward calorimeter is a particularly challenging detector due to the high level of radiation to which it has to be exposed. However, it benefits from continuity of coverage, reducing to the minimum the effects of the crack in the transition region around \(\eta=3.1\), with advantages for the efficiency of forward jet tagging and the reduction of the tails in the \(E_{T}^{miss}\) distribution. The forward calorimeter has to accommodate at least 9 \(\lambda_{abs}\) of active

detector in a rather short longitudinal space. Thus it is a high density detector, consisting of three longitudinal sections, the first one made of copper, and the other two of tungsten. Each of them consists of a metal matrix with regularly spaced longitudinal channels filled with detecting rods. The sensitive medium is Liquid Argon that fills the gap between the rod and matrix. The gaps are 250 microns wide in the first section and 375 (500) microns in the second (last) one. In the forward calorimeter the electronic noise in a jet cone of \(\Delta R=0.5\) is \(\sim 1\) GeV \(E_{T}\) at \(\eta=3.2\) and drops quickly to 0.1 GeV in \(E_{T}\) at \(\eta=4.6\).

## Chapter 3 The ATLAS Tile Calorimeter.

As already said, the Tile Calorimeter is a sampling device made out of steel and scintillator tiles. The innovative feature of this design is the orientation of the tiles scintillating which are placed in planes perpendicular to the colliding beams.

The essential design features: the geometry, the optics and the electronics, will be summarized in this chapter.

### 3.1 The geometry of the Tile Calorimeter

The Tile Calorimeter consists of a cylindrical structure with inner and outer radius of 2280 and 4230 \(mm\) respectively. It is designed as one Barrel, which is 5640 \(mm\) in length along the beam axis, and two Extended Barrel hadron parts, which are 2910 \(mm\) long. Each of them is further subdivided into 64 independent azimuthal modules (see figure 3.1). Between the barrel and the extended barrels there is a gap of about 600 \(mm\), which is needed for the Inner Detector and the LAr cabling, electronics and services. The loss of hermeticity implied by this gap is partially recovered for by using an Intermediate Tile Calorimeter (ITC), with the same structure as the rest of the calorimeter, but with special geometry. The barrel covers the region \(|\eta|<1.0\), and the extended barrels cover the region \(0.8<|\eta|<1.7\).

The iron structure of each module consists of a stack of repeating elements called periods, which are the basic geometrical elements of the calorimeter. Two iron end plates, 20 \(mm\) thick, close the module at each end. Each period consists of 4 layers: the first and third layer are formed by large trapezoidal iron plates (masters) of 5 \(mm\) thickness,spanning the full radial dimension of the module (\(\sim\) 1.6 m); the second and fourth layers consist of a set of small trapezoidal iron plates (spacers) 4 \(mm\) thick. They are placed between the master plates leaving gaps along the radial direction, where the 3 \(mm\) thick scintillator tiles are introduced (in black in figure 3.2). The relative position of the spacers in two consecutive layers is staggered in the radial direction. Each central (extended) barrel module is stacked with 311 (145) periods arranged along the barrel axis.

The thickness of the calorimeter ( \(\sim\) 8\(\lambda\)) is chosen such that the hadronic showers are well contained, and that there is enough material to suffi

flux reaching the muon system. The ability of the calorimeter to identify muons helps to recover the momentum resolution for low energy muons, where energy losses before the muon chambers must be evaluated accurately.

### 3.2 The optics of the Tile Calorimeter

Eleven sets of tiles of 4 different radial sizes, pointing radially to the beam line, form the longitudinal segmentation of the detector and are used as the active material. A pair of wavelength shifting (WLS) fibers collects light from the tiles at both of the \(\phi\) edges of the tiles. Readout cells are defined by grouping together a set of fibers onto a photomultiplier (PMT), obtaining three-dimensional segmentation. The segmentation formed by the module geometry and scintillator cell structure is \(\Delta\eta\times\Delta\phi\)=\(0.1\times 0.1\). In the last radial layer, where the broad tails of hadronic showers will be measured, the segmentation is \(0.2\times 0.1\).

Ionizing particles crossing the tiles induce the production of light in the base material of the tiles, with wavelengths in the UV range, which subsequently is converted to visible light by scintillator dyes. This scintillation light propagates through the tile to its edges, where it is absorbed by the WLS fibers and shifted to a longer wavelength (chosen to match the sensitive region of the PMT photocathode). A light mixer is placed between the fibers and the photocathode to optimize detection uniformity.

The driving philosophy behind the optics design is to achieve and maintain a uniform, minimum light yield that achieves the required resolution. The photoelectron yield is a complex factor depending not only on the light output of the tiles, but also on the light collection efficiency, the PMT choice and the fiber choice. A photoelectron yield of 20 phe/GeV (corresponds to 0.5 photoelectrons (phe) per minimum ionizing particle (\(mip\)) per tile at normal incidence) is enough for the photoelectron statistics not to limit the calorimeter energy resolution. The measured photo-electron yield of the TileCal in much greater, 63 to 70 phe/GeV, depending on the base material of the tiles, with nominal photo-tube gain a response of 1.2 pC/GeV of EM energy at 90\({}^{\circ}\) (normal incidence) was measured in 2001. This corresponds to a dynamic range of 1.5 TeV/cell, with a non-linearity of PMTs at the high end of about 2%. Online laser calibrations are foreseen to monitor non-linearities of photo-tubes. The dynamic range may be extended above 1.5 TeV/cell using non-saturated energy samples. The technique is under study.

Furthermore, the detector is expected to operate a minimum of 10 \(years\). Typical aging rates for a scintillator-WLS system is 1-3% loss of light per year. An observed 200% safety margin is considered to be enough to absorb aging and other possible effects.

Non-uniformity throughout the detector should also be kept small so as not to impact the constant term of the energy resolution. The baseline goal is an \(rms\) non-uniformity within a cell up to 10%. The radial fluctuations inside a cell due to the fact that two tiles can be read by the same fiber are typically 5% to 10% and cannot be improved without substantially increasing the number of fibers.

#### The scintillators.

The scintillating tiles are the active medium of the TileCal calorimeter. Light yield, uniformity of response within a tile and tile-to-tile uniformity are key performance issues.

TileCal contains 11 different sizes of trapezoidal shaped tiles, ranging from 220 to 360 \(mm\) in the azimuthal direction and from 97 to 187 \(mm\) in radial width. The tile thickness is 3 \(mm\). Each tile has two holes, 9 \(mm\) in diameter, through the surface for the passage of the calibration source tubes and of mechanical fasteners.

Two different commercially available optically transparent granulated polystyrene are used as the scintillation matrix base, PSM or BASF polystyrene. The polystyrene is dried and then mixed with finely dispersed wavelength shifting dyes. The mixture is molten and injection-molded to produce each tile. The wavelength shifting process consists of a sequence of light absorptions and emissions in the chosen dye system. The chosen dopants are paraterphenyl (PTP) -1.5%- and POPOP -0.04%-. In a binary scintillator such as used in TileCal, the initial radiation at the wavelengths 240-300 \(nm\) induced by the ionizing particles is transmitted through the polystyrene lattice until it is absorbed by a primary PTP molecule. PTP emits light in the range 320-400 \(nm\), which is absorbed by POPOP and converted to a longer blue wavelength (around 420 \(nm\) and higher).

The uniformity of the light output of a tile depends on the local light yield uniformity and on the tile transparency. Fluctuations in tile properties depend on both the raw material properties and the stability of the molding machine operation. Internal stresses, flow lines and other plastic deformations in the tiles may affect their optical quality.

A study of the optical properties of tiles with PSM or BASF polystyrene was done [10]. The results show that the output light for BASF tiles is about 25% higher than for tileswith PSM polystyrene. This does not represent a problem for the uniformity response of the calorimeter unless both kind of tiles are mixed in a same cell of calorimeter read by the same PMT. In this case, the tiles of BASF polystyrene are painted with strips at the two edges of tile. This masking reduces the amount of the light leaving the tiles to the desired level.

Before the scintillating tiles are inserted into TileCal, they are wrapped with a covering material. The wrapper protects the optically reflective surface of the tile from contact with other materials. It also provides protection from mechanical damage and enhances the light yield by redirecting some of the light which is not captured by internal reflections back into the tile. To achieve a non-uniformity across the tiles below 5%, a non-reflective mask is printed on the wrapper. \(Tyvek^{TM}\), a material made of high density polyethylene fibers, has been chosen because of its high reflectance and mechanical toughness. The gain in light output is between 5% and 10%, compared to ordinary paper wrapping, and about 20% compared with unwrapped tiles.

#### The WLS fibers.

The WLS fibers are placed in contact with the non-parallel edges of the tiles. Each fiber collects scintillation light from of one to two tiles and transmits it to a PMT. The fluor in the fiber absorbs the blue light from the scintillator and re-emits it at a longer wavelength. The light subsequently propagates along the fiber, of 1 \(mm\) diameter, by total internal reflection. Light collection is required to be efficient, fast, with low attenuation along the fiber and the fibers must be radiation hard, up to a total dose of 400 \(Gy\). Natural aging over ten years should be negligible.

Four fibers for the barrels and three for the extended barrels are required to read out one side of each half-period. In the barrel the fiber length ranges from between 85 \(cm\) and 210 \(cm\), depending on which cell is to be read and the location of the half-period. In the extended barrel the fiber length ranges from 90 \(cm\) to 230 \(cm\). Extruded profiles, each of which carries four (or three) WLS fibers, are used to keep the fibers in contact with scintillator edges (see figure 3.3).

The WLS fibers have been selected to have the following requirements:

* The absorption spectrum of the fiber matches the emission spectrum of the scintillator and the emission spectrum of the fiber matches the quantum efficiency of the PMT.
* The fibers have high light yield and attenuation length.
* The fibers are flexible enough, suffering minimum damage by stress due to curved paths.
* The direct fiber response (Cherenkov and scintillation light) to ionizing particles is small in order to avoid large signals from particles passing between modules.

#### Fiber routing.

The Tilecal module cells are pseudo-projective in \(\eta\). The cell geometry for half of a barrel module is shown in figure 3.4 and for a full extended barrel in figure 3.5.

One of the most important parameters for the cell response is the "light budget", which is defined as the product of the tile response and the fiber response. The cells within TileCal group several tile sizes and several fiber lengths, in general leading to non-uniformities of light output within a cell and amongst cells themselves. It is the purpose of the fiber routing design to minimize these non-uniformities. The conditions to be satisfied by the fiber routing design are:

Figure 3.3: Profiles driving the WLS fibers to contact the tiles edges.

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:31]

* Minimized non-uniformity within cells.
* Maximal light output in order to keep a high photostatistics level.
* Minimal fiber length for optimum light output, to minimize the volume of the fiber in the girder region and also to minimize the cost.
* Small non-uniformity amongst cells to allow PMTs to have similar gains.
* Small number of different fiber lengths for efficient fiber insertion into profiles.

The fibers reach the PMTs in a bundle, i.e., all the fibers reading one side of a cell are routed in a group. These bundles are glued into containers, called "aspirin tubes", that have been previously introduced in the bundle rings in the drawer. Later they are cut with a precision of better than 0.1 \(mm\), such that the air gap between the end of the bundle and the PMT is \(\sim 1\)\(mm\); at the same time, they are polished to a flatness of few \(\mu m\). Each of the bundles arriving to a PMT is made up of different sub-bundles grouping a smaller number of fibers.

##### Depth segmentation

The Tile Calorimeter modules have tree radial samplings labelled A,BC and D(A,B and D for Extended Barrel modules). The samplings may be seen in figures 3.4 and 3.5, where the cell division into three samplings is shown. The cells are made by grouping fibres coming from different scintillators and at the same radial depth into the bundle of fibers. Each bundle is connected to a dedicated PMT. The cell granularity, as it was already mentioned, is \(\Delta\eta\)=0.1 for the two inner samples, i.e. A and BC (B or C for the Extended Barrel),and \(\Delta\eta\)=0.2 for the outer one (D).

Sample A groups the scintillating tiles 1,2 and 3 which are the three smaller ones. The sample B groups tiles 4,5 and 6 (and 7 for the Extended Barrel). The sample C groups 7,8 and 9 and finally, the sample D groups tiles 10 and 11 (also 8 and 9 for Extended Barrel).

Information on the cell response for each tile size may be obtained from the source calibration scan or from beam particles passing through the cell in a chosen direction. A sub-sample which combines tiles of the same size within a given cell is called TileRow segment (_TR-segment_) (see figure 3.6), and is the finest detection element of the TileCal.

### 3.3 The electronics of the Tile Calorimeter.

All front-end and digitizing electronics is located in a cavity inside the girder, on a system of removable drawers also containing the PMTs. Phototube HVs are locally regulated and derived from a voltage source common to the drawer. Digitizers and digital pipelines are also local, and the digital information is transferred to the Readout Drivers (RODs) in the counting room via optical fibers.

The only electronics outside the drawers is located in the electronics room, and consist of the HV source power supply, the Level-1 trigger (LVL1), the Tile Calorimeter Readout Drivers, and the control electronics for the three calibration systems. The general scheme of the calorimeter readout is given in figure 3.7.

The calorimeter must be able to measure energy depositions up to 1.5 TeV in a single cell. This determines, at the high end, the dynamic range of the electronics. At the low end, it should be able to measure the signal from muons, which deposit about 0.5 GeV in the thinnest cell. The resolution of the readout system must be small compared to the intrinsic energy resolution of the calorimeter.

Figure 3.6: Example in an Extender Barrel module of one of the subsample called _TR-segment_

#### PMT Blocks.

The PMT block contains a light mixer, a phototube, a divider, and a so-called 3-in-1 base (see figure 3.8). The PMT block is contained within a cylindrical shell which acts as magnetic shielding and reads out one fiber bundle of TileCal.

**- The PMTs.**

The main requirements of the PMTs are a nominal gain of \(10^{5}\) with a high voltage of less than 1 \(kV\); a quantum efficiency of more than 18% at 480 \(nm\); a dark current at nominal gain smaller than 1 \(nA\); and a maximum non-linearity of 2% for pulses of 15 \(ns\) and 50 \(mA\) currents. Measures of properties of the chosen PMTs are done in different institutes, the average values are the nominal gain of \(10^{5}\) with a high voltage of 0.7 \(kV\); a quantum efficiency of 18.6% at 480 \(nm\); a dark current at nominal gain of 0.4 \(nA\), so

Figure 3.7: General scheme of the Tile Calorimeter readout.

the requirement are satisfied [11].

To allow individual adjustment of the PMT gains while keeping a reasonable cost for power supplies, the high-voltage power is organized into two stages. First, a general HV power supply provides a single voltage to each drawer. Then, within the drawers, controllers using optocouplers distribute individual voltages to the PMTs. The external HV power supplies provide 10 \(mA\) at 1 \(kV\) to each drawer. The individual HVs are stabilized to better than 0.1%.

The PMT is directly connected to the 3-in-1 board via the divider. The primary purpose of the divider is to partition the high voltage between the dynodes of the PMT. The divider also serves as a socket allowing connection of the PMT to the front-end electronics without any interconnecting wires. This design is important to reduce noise.

**- Light mixers.**

Most PMTs exhibit large variations in response over their photocathode surfaces, but the photoelectrons generated by light coming from the various fibers inside a given bundle must be independent of the fiber location at the photocathode. The role of the light mixer is to spread the light coming from the fibers so that there is no correlation between the position of a fiber and the area of the photocathode which receives its light.

Figure 3.8: PMT block scheme.

The light mixers must have the following characteristics: uniform light output at a level of at least 90%; high light acceptance; light attenuation of a few percent; short length to provide space for the 3-in-1 base and to provide an air gap of less than 1 \(mm\) between the PMT block and the fiber bundle; and no Cherenkov light from incoming particles.

A square light guide with a length of 1.9 times its side and with a face that is fully contained by the photocathode exhibits the required performance. This corresponds to a length of 35 \(mm\) and a face of \(18\times 18\)\(mm^{2}\) for the chosen PMTs. The maximum variations in uniformity using the light mixer are about 10%.

From the optical point of view, air gaps introduce a sizeable loss of light. However, this loss is stable and independent of the size of the gap, as long as it is within a range of \(\sim\)1 mm. This distance is enough to allow mechanical movement of the drawers.

**- 3-in-1 boards.**

The 3-in-1 boards in the PMT block form the front-end of the electronics readout chain. The 3-in-1 base contains: a fast shaper electronics interface between the PMT and the pipeline dedicated to the pulse analysis, a slow integrator circuit for measuring the current from cesium calibration system and minimum bias events, and the dual calibration circuity. They are located inside the steel shield of the PMT. This location of the front-end electronics provides an operating environment shielded from electrical noise and magnetic fields. The ambient radiation levels are low and the thermal stability inside the steel girder is excellent.

#### Fast pulse electronics.

The fast readout electronics must process signals from \(10,110\) PMTs every \(25\)\(ns\). A design based on using a linear dual-gain pulse shaper and two commercial 12-bit ADC chips per channel (the bi-gain design) has been chosen. For Tilecal, with its relatively modest number of channels and low channel density, digital pipeline storage has been developed instead of analogue pipeline storage.

Signals corresponding to the energy in the 2000 calorimeter trigger towers must be formed and sent to the LVL1 trigger electronics on every beam crossing. During the \(2.5\mu s\) latency of the LVL1 trigger, the individual calorimeter signals are stored in the pipeline. Following the latency period, data from events accepted by the LVL1 trigger are passedto RODs for further processing. Signals from beam crossings failing the LVL1 trigger are discarded.

### 3.4 Calibration, monitoring and testing

To achieve a good energy resolution in a system with about 10,000 channels, a carefully established calibration of each cell is required. A combined system of radioactive source calibration (that "sees" the optics and the PMTs, and has its own electronics), pulsed laser calibration (that "sees" the PMTs and the standard readout electronics), and electronic charge injection (for the readout electronics) is planned. Together, they monitor the scintillators, fibres, PMTs and readout chain and should help to identify the source of any variation and to ensure cell-to-cell uniformity.

PMT gain drifts will be monitored using a YLF solid state laser. This generates light pulses with a width of about 15 ns and a wavelength of 523 nm, which are similar to the signals from the WLS fibres. The intensity of each light pulse is measured by a set of photodiodes and the photodiodes and the associated electronics are in turn monitored by an \({}^{241}\)Am source. It is foreseen to pulse the laser during the bunch-free periods. Trains of light pulses of increasing intensity will span the entire calorimeter dynamic range.

The detector will be calibrated periodically with a radioactive source and continuously with the current induced by minimum-bias events from the pp collider. In the source-monitoring mode, the readout speed is limited by the source advancement speed (about 30 cm/s). Under these conditions, and with the anticipated number of sources, the whole calorimeter can be calibrated in about 8 hours. In contrast, to read out the calorimeter minimum-bias current only seconds may be needed to reach 1% accuracy level.

The readout system must undergo electronic testing and calibration. This applies to both the fast readout and that of the slow integrators. The tests are to ensure the proper functioning of all elements of the system and also to determine the calibration constants and non-linearities of the individual channels. For this testing a variable charge will be injected into the input of each analysis channel.

## Chapter 4 Calibration of the Tile Calorimeter.

The goal of the Tile Calorimeter, together with other calorimeters of ATLAS, is to determine particle and jet energies which have to be extracted from the signals measured in the calorimeters. The main point is to get the overall energy calibration scale, i.e. the factor that relates the energy released in the calorimeter to the digitized signal produced at the end of the readout chain. This is not quite enough in such a large experiment, which will last several years, and will have different calibration constants for each readout channel that will change during its lifetime. For this reason one needs to measure this calibration factor for each readout channel, and/or to minimize its channel-to-channel variation, and to monitor this set of calibration factors over the lifetime of the detector in order to correct their variation in time. To fulfill these objectives, calibration and inter-calibration techniques as well as numerous monitoring tools have been developed within all the calorimeters of ATLAS.

A quantity which characterizes the quality of the energy measurement by the calorimeter is known as energy resolution. It is used to quantify the uncertainty in a calorimeter measurement. The energy resolution can be parameterized by the following quadratic sum:

\[\frac{\sigma}{E}=\frac{a}{\sqrt{E}}\oplus\frac{b}{E}\oplus c \tag{4.1}\]

where \(a\) is the so-called stochastic term, \(b\) is the noise term and \(c\) is the constantterm (\(E\) is usually expressed in GeV). Depending on the energy range involved in an experiment, the optimization of these three parameters can be very different.

The stochastic term is given by the statistical fluctuation of the number of detected primary processes. The threshold of detection is usually small enough that the number of processes, which give a useful signal is large, improves the resolution and makes for a smaller value of a. In general, these fluctuations have to be convoluted with instrumental effects which dominate the resolution: uncertainty in the calibration, stability of the electronics or fluctuations in shower leakages, which contribute to the constant term and the noise term.

The \(b\) term of the energy resolution describes the noise and may be dominant at low energy. Besides the electronics noise, a second contribution is important in LHC calorimeters: the pile-up noise. At the LHC design luminosity, about twenty soft collisions will be produced, on average, for every bunch crossing, giving rise to so-called pile-up both in space and time. This reflects the high multiplicity of charged and neutral particles with a low average momentum (\(\leq\)500 MeV/c) which impact in the calorimeter during each bunch crossing. The fluctuations in the mean value of this pile-up contribute as a noise term to the energy resolution.

The constant term \(c\), which becomes dominant at the higher LHC energies, includes many contributions:

* Non-compensation (e/h\(\neq\)1)
* Non-uniformity of the calorimeter from both electronic and mechanical design.
* Mis-calibration of different parts of the calorimeter.
* Signal variation with temperature or pollution of the active medium which may vary across the calorimeter or as a function of time.
* Lateral and longitudinal leakages.
* Degradation of the energy resolution due to the material in front of the calorimeter.

### The overall calibration factor and inter-calibration in the Tile Calorimeter

Calibration is a major concern in large systems like the ATLAS calorimetry, consisting of several different sub-detectors with a large number of channels. In particular, a precise determination of the absolute energy scale, both in the e.m. and hadronic calorimeter, will be needed to exploit the physics potential at the LHC. The reference scale for individual cell energy calibration will be the EM scale. The jet energy scale will be obtained by applying correction factors. The calibration of the calorimeters will involve several techniques, which will eventually cross-check and reinforce each other:

* Several calorimeter modules, both for the e.m. and hadronic parts, will be studied with test beams during the construction phase. This allows spotting problems in the construction, to check the uniformity of response, the reproducibility from module to module, to tune Monte Carlo simulations, etc.
* Residual non-uniformities inside the whole detector when mounted cannot be excluded. These can be attributed, for instance, to the non-uniformity in the material distribution in front of the e.m. calorimeter, temperature gradients, mechanical deformations, etc. Furthermore, it will be necessary to transfer the single-pion calibration to the calorimeter response to particle jets produced in the pp collisions. Therefore, _in situ_ calibration with physics events will be needed, and may eventually be the most powerful calibration tool, as has been demonstrated by the Tevatron experiments [12][13].

In both the e.m. and hadronic calorimeters, the relation between the jet energy scale and the mass scale may depend on the algorithms used and on instrumental effects.

The calibration of the hadronic calorimeter is not straightforward. The difficulty comes from the already mentioned transfer of the single-pion response to the jet response, and from the different types of jets (gluon, light-quark, b-quark), which require separate calibration given their different particle multiplicities, lepton content, etc. Conceptually there are two aspects of the jet energy calibration that are clearly distinguished in the calibration procedure. The first step consists in calibrating the experimentally measured jet energy in the calorimeter such as to reproduce the energy of the cluster of particles that forms it. The second step consists in inferring the energy of the parton whose fragmentation resulted in the measured jet.

### The overall calibration factor and inter-calibration in the Tile Calorimeter

* Tau lepton decays are a potential source of isolated hadrons, whose momentum vector p can be accurately measured in the tracking detectors. Since their energy E will be measured in the calorimeter, the relation E/p\(\approx\)1 can be used to adjust the absolute energy scale for pions. Requiring a signal compatible with a mip, in the EM compartment, allows a clean selection of single pions in the hadronic compartment, that can be directly correlated with test beam data. Also for the hadronic calorimeters, the E/p measurement with single pions is potentially a useful tool for cell-to-cell inter-calibration.
* Information from \(\gamma\)+jet and Z\({}^{o}\)+jet events can be used to transfer the energy scale from the e.m. calorimeter and inner detector to the hadronic calorimeters through p\({}_{T}\)-balance. In these samples, selection of events where the jet is a b-quark would provide the b-jet scale as well. One of the limitations due to systematic effects is that the \(\gamma\)+jet sample contains a significant amount of background (especially for low p\({}_{T}\)). Also both contain a mixture of quark and gluon jets and an accurate calibration will require the disentangling of systematic differences between the quark and gluon jet energy scales, which are expected to be different since gluon fragmentation is broader (with higher particle multiplicities) than the light quark fragmentation. Also, the jet veto1 together with the effect of final state radiation may produce some bias in the p\({}_{T}\) balance. Footnote 1: The jet veto is a technique to reject backgrounds. It consists in vetoing events with a specific characteristics of final state jets.
* The use of W \(\rightarrow\) jet-jet decays, given the precise knowledge of the W mass, is most probably the best calibration method to be applied in top-mass measurements, and more generally for dijet and multijet mass spectroscopy. At a luminosity of 10\({}^{33}\) cm\({}^{-2}\)s\({}^{-1}\), hundreds of thousands of W bosons from top quark decays will be reconstructed each year. This sample will provide a great opportunity to calibrate the absolute jet energy scale of the ATLAS calorimeters, but the overlap of the two jets for energetic Ws will need thorough studies to choose the best algorithm and control systematic effects. However, given the large number of events in these "control samples" at the LHC, the ultimate precision on the energy scale will most likely be dominated by systematic effects, related more to the knowledge of the physics (background, presence of additional jets in the event, underlying event) than to the comprehension of detector effects. Thanks to the availability of high statistics data samples a detailed study of the detector effwill give the possibility of correcting them to a certain extent.
* A muon signal in the calorimeter cells provides information about the absolute EM energy scale and is a useful independent source of information both for low energy calibration and inter-calibration of various cells in various calorimeters.

While for LAr calorimeters the EM scale may be known on day-1 to a precision of about 1% from _in situ_ calibrations, it will take substantial time in the case of the Tile calorimeter to accumulate enough statistics (and evaluate associated systematics) for the processes considered above. The initial EM scale for individual cell of Tile calorimeter will be obtained from the energy deposited in the cells by electrons during the Test Beam runs. A dedicated system based on movable Cs radioactive source will transport this scale to the cells/modules which will not be exposed to the electrons during the Test Beams. Corrections extracted from the Cs to muon correlations will be applied on top of this calibration. This work will demonstrate that such with a precision of about 3% and approach will result in an initial cell calibration of the Tile calorimeter.

### 4.2 Monitoring

The signal path, from particle interaction in the Tile Calorimeter to the digitized output of the physic signal readout chain, can be separated in three stages (figure 4.1). The first one is the light response, which is the combination of the energy deposition and the optical response (scintillator and WLS fibres). Next comes the charge response. In this step the light pulse is converted into a charge at the PMT anode, which depends on the gain and quantum efficiency of the PMT. Finally the physical signal, contained in the charge coming from the PMT anode, is read out and digitized.

In principle, these responses will change in time. The light may change due to ageing processes of the scintillators and fibres, or to radiation damage. These changes are typically slow, with time constants of hours to months. Other possible changes of the light yield, such as deterioration of optical contact, may be more abrupt. The photomultiplier response may change due to gain drifts, which typically occurring over hours to days; deterioration of gain or quantum efficiency, which is much slower except for excessive signal loads; etc. It is also useful to test the behavior of each read-out channel.

The inter-calibration and monitoring strategy for the Tilecal is based on several tools:* During data taking at the LHC, continuous monitoring of the signal produced in the calorimeter by inelastic proton-proton collisions at small momentum transfers, the so-called minimum bias (MB) interactions.
* Movable radioactive sources which excite light in all scintillators of each module.
* A laser which produces on each PMT a light pulse which closely mimics calorimeter pulses.
* A charge injection system (CIS), which generates a charge signal like the one that would come from the PMT on each read-out channel.

The requirements on the precision of the monitoring and of the inter-calibration of the calorimeter readout cells is about 1%, because this would allow early detection of degradation phenomena. The requirements on the inter-calibration of the readout cells must be set in terms of the overall resolution of the calorimeter, and they turn to be much less stringent than 1%.

#### Monitoring using the minimum bias event

The so-called Minimum Bias (MB) events, which manifest themselves as noise in the calorimeters and limit their performance, can also be used to continuously monitor the response of Tilecal.

Figure 4.1: Conceptual diagram of signal path for the Tile Calorimeter and calibration entry points

The rate of energy deposition by MB processes is proportional to the LHC luminosity and is uniform in azimuthal angle, but is moderately dependent on \(\eta\) over the range spanned by Tilecal. It produces a signal in the PMTs that is usually large enough to be recorded with inexpensive electronics by measuring the anode current averaged over a time scale of milliseconds.

The proportionality to the LHC luminosity depends on clean running conditions, i.e. on the absence of appreciable contributions from beam losses due to beam-gas or beam-wall scattering. Under these conditions the average current in each readout cell divided by the instantaneous luminosity gives a number proportional to the overall response of the calorimeter, that should be constant in time. Any variation of the MB current to luminosity ratio can be compared to information from the laser and movable source systems to understand the behavior of the calorimeter in time and correct for it.

The MB signal provides a manner to continuously monitor the response of the calorimeter because it can be read out during physics runs without interfering with normal data acquisition.

#### Source inter-calibration and monitoring system

The Tile Calorimeter is designed to allow a movable source to pass through every scintillator tile. Each scintillator tile has two holes along the symmetry axis; the source guide tube is usually inserted through one of them (see figure 4.2). The radioactive source emits radiation that excites the scintillators. Afterward that signal is read using the read-out path up to the PMT and a dedicated electronics. Therefore the current induced in a PMT reading one cell, as well as if it was from an actual event, is proportional to the amount of energy deposited in the calorimeter, the light yield for that particular cell and the quantum efficiency of the PMT. The use of a movable \(\gamma\) source allows to check the quality of the optical response and its uniformity, to equalize the response of all readout cells by adjusting the gain of the corresponding PMT, and to monitor in time the average current of each cell.

The actual signal produced by the source passage through 5 readout cells of the calorimeter is shown in figure 4.3. The multiple peak structure in the response of each PMT is due to the passage of an 8 mCi \({}^{137}\)Cs source through individual tiles. The source-induced current is measured about every 3 mm, giving 6 points per period (the tile-to-tile spacing is 18 mm); a case of faulty light collection from one tile is clearly seen. The capability to see individual tiles is due to the mean free path of the Cs gammas, which is of the order of the 18 mm separation between tiles.

The movable source system is the main tool to equalize the response of the calorimeter readout cells within a module, and between different modules. This is done by adjusting the high voltage of each PMT to obtain the same average signal from each cell. The

Figure 4.3: Current measured in the PMTs as a function of the source position along the rod(z axis)

Figure 4.2: Mechanical concept of the source calibration system

average response values are measured again at later times, providing information about the stability of the overall calorimeter response and also the cross-calibration information for the analysis of data.

A movable source system allows using just a few sources to calibrate the whole TileCal. For long-term monitoring of the calorimeter response, the precisely known decay rate of the activity of sources must of course be taken into account.

The cell inter-calibration errors in calorimeters contribute to the constant term in the energy resolution. Hence, some requirements of system precision have to be achieved. The effect of miss-calibration errors for the Tile calorimeter has been investigated and the conclusion of theses studies is that a calibration \(\sigma_{mis}\) produce a contribution to the constant term of the resolution of 0.3\(\sigma_{mis}\) to the energy measured in the TileCal. This is in turn roughly 1/2 of the energy of a jet. In summary, for the cell inter-calibration a 1% precision is sufficient. This value is determined by the fact that a 5% random cell miss-calibration would add 1.5% quadratically to the constant term of the energy resolution for pions and less than 1% for jets. This 1% would be also useful for the response monitoring for reasons of early detection of any degradation.

##### The radioactive sources

General requirements on the sources are:

* \(\gamma\) energy must be high enough to allow attenuation through the 1 mm thick steel tubes lower than 10%, in such a way that the variation of the useful flux due to tolerances on the tube thickness is less than 1%.
* The activity in a volume not exceeding 5 mm\({}^{3}\) should be sufficient to produce average currents of more than 10 nA at the photomultiplier anodes.
* The contamination by short-lived isotopes must not introduce an uncertainty of more than 1% in the gamma flux relative to the initial value.
* It is desirable that the lifetime of the source be sufficiently long to permit at most one replacement over the lifetime of ATLAS, including the construction phase.

The \({}^{137}\)Cs (E\({}_{\gamma}\)=0.662 MeV, t\({}_{1/2}\)=30.2y) satisfies all these requirements. The activity density requirements arises because it is desirable for the source to extend less than 3 mm - the thickness of scintillating tiles - as illustrated in figure 4.4. Finally, commercially available \({}^{137}\)Cs from nuclear fuel reprocessing contains a small enough contamination of the short-lived \({}^{134}\)Cs isotope (with t\({}_{1/2}\)=2.9y) to meet the last requirement.

##### The source system

A hydraulic system is used to drive the \(Cs^{137}\) source trough the calorimeter modules in which calibration tubes are installed. The source calibration tubes are filled with distilled water which is set in motion with a pump. A capsule containing an 8 \(mCi\)\(Cs^{137}\) source is placed in the water. The capsule has a diameter slightly smaller than the tube aperture. The flow passing through the capsule is negligible and its velocity is practically the same as that of the liquid, about 30cm/sec.

Eleven tubes (one per TileRow) are connected together, with bent tube sections, to form a single circuit which traverses all of the calorimeter tiles (see figure 4.5). The two ends of the circuit are connected to the liquid drive unit by flexible tubes. The drive unit is located in the control room and consists of a gear pump, pressure and temperature sensors, electromechanical valves and a reservoir. The system is remotely controlled. The source capsule is kept in a \(Pb\) garage outside the test room. A remotely controlled mechanism inserts the source into the moving liquid column. At the end of its path through the calorimeter, the source comes to rest against a mechanical stop. The direction of the liquid flow is then inverted, and the source returns to its starting place. As is showed in figure 4.5 the tubes passed trough the outer radius hole of each tile giving as a result a set of measurements, approximately 6\(\times\)number of tiles, for each tile row in each cell (_TR-segment_).

#### 4.2.2.3 The Current Integrator

The charge integrator is located on the 3-in-1 card, and is designed to measure the average current of each calorimeter cell due to the energy deposits from the radioactive source, or from MB interactions. The currents from the PMTs must be averaged over a time scale which is long enough to suppress the ripple from individual pulses, as well as fluctuations in the amplitude and rate of energy deposits in each cell.

The PMT current induced by an 8 mCi source corresponds mostly to single photoelectrons at a rate of about 4 MHz giving an average current of about 50 nA at the nominal PMT gain of \(10^{5}\). In order to observe the signal variations as the source moves across the tiles at the design velocity of 300 mm/s, the integrator requires a defined bandwidth. The tile period is 18 mm, and then the maximum signal variation frequency is:

\[\text{f}= (300\text{mm/s})/(18\text{mm})=16.7\text{ Hz}.\]

Because the cell inter-calibration procedure is based on an integral process, the amplitude of these variations is not critical, however it is important to see properly these oscillations in order to detect optic defects such as broken fibres or bad couplings. A time constant of 10 ms corresponds to a bandwidth of 17 Hz and is sufficient for this qualitative

check.

The dynamic range requirements are set by the range of MB currents anticipated as the LHC luminosity increases from an initial value of about \(10^{33}\) cm\({}^{-2}\)s\({}^{-1}\) to a maximum of \(10^{34}\) cm\({}^{-2}\)s\({}^{-1}\). The minimum-bias current also varies with radial distance from the interaction point, and with \(\eta\). Taking into account all the dependencies, MB currents are expected to span the range between 5 nA and 500 nA.

The slow current integrator output is digitized by a 12 bit ADC that has an input dynamic range of 5 V. For the Cs source calibration, a resolution better than 1% is achieved but the overall range expected for MB currents does not allow to cover the whole currents range with a resolution of about 1%. Therefore a programmable transimpedance is required to maintain an adequate resolution and its values are chosen according to the calorimeter depth and LHC luminosity (the required resolution is fixed such that the smallest expected minimum bias current will be converted into 40 counts).

An integrator time constant of 10 ms is adequate for the source calibration system to limit far below 1% the fluctuations due to the stochastic nature of the source emission. The MB current fluctuations are larger because of the tail of the energy spectra. For this, averages over several measurements will be used to reproduced MB current in the least populated Tilecal cells.

The circuit is built around a low cost LF411CD JFET input stage operational amplifier (see figure 4.6). Bandwidth and noise are not limiting factors because of the low frequency response of the circuit. The circuit is DC coupled to the PMT anode through a net that is compatible with the shaper specifications. The programmable high gain is achieved with a switched T feedback network, however the high impedances used make the circuit sensitive to electromagnetic interferences that have to be handled carefully. The multiplexing facility is achieved by a local output switch. The device is controlled by the 3-in-1 controller that sends the appropriate commands through the 3-in-1 bus. The commands are decoded and processed by the local logic of the 3-in-1 cards.

#### The laser system

The main purpose of the laser system is to monitor the response of the PMTs on any desired time scale, from the very shortest (minutes) to the duration of the ATLAS experiment. It allows to monitor the conversion from light to charge, and its changes in time, due to gain drift. The laser pulse are read out through the same electronics used for physics events, therefore PMT response can be measured during data-taking with minimal interference. It is planned to obtain the PMT gain to a relative precision of 0.5% by measuring the laser light intensity pulse by pulse. This system will also be useful to check the pulse electronics following the PMTs.

The core of this system is a computer-controlled frequency-doubled YLF2 solid-state laser in which the light pulses are externally triggered and intensity-modulated. The laser pulses closely mimic the scintillating light produced by particles in the calorimeter, having a wavelength of 480 nm and a pulse width of about 15 ns.

Footnote 2: The frequency of the infra-red light emitted by the laser head has to be doubled to a green light to match the quantum efficiency of the PMTs. YLF stands for Yttrium Lithium Fluoride

The laser pulse intensity is precisely measured on a pulse-by-pulse basis by photodiodes. The linearity of the photodiode readout electronics is checked with a charge injection system; the response of the photodiodes is monitored with an \({}^{241}\)Am alpha source, which provides a reference that is stable in time and insensitive to environmental changes.

Laser calibrations are performed generating a train of pulses of increasing amplitude, reaching the upper end of the PMT dynamic range. The light is transmitted to the PMTs through clear fibres, which are bundled together with the WLS fibres reading the scintillator tiles in the modules (each fibre bundle will contain two clear fibres). The effective dynamic range of the laser in this mode is only about 30, whereas the calorimeter dynamic

Figure 4.6: Slow current integrator schematic.

range in ATLAS is about 60000. To obtain this range a set of remotely controlled filters will be installed on the laser light path. Amplitude monitoring and timing measurements are made upstream of these filters.

#### Charge injection system (CIS)

Build in the 3-in-1 cards housed at each PMT block, there is a CIS system which is able to inject a predefined charge pulse into the input. The pulse is generated by the discharge of precisely know capacitors (one for low gain and the other for high gain), which is loaded using a DAC and a regulated reference voltage.

It is important to test the behavior of each read-out channel over its full dynamic range. This permits a prompt diagnosis of read-out faults and test with realistic pattern of energy deposition over the full calorimeter.

This is used for the internal calibration of the complete electronic chain.

### 4.3 Test Beam

Using a secondary SPS (Super Proton Synchrotron) beam (see figure 4.7), the Tile Calorimeter community has planned an exhaustive program of calibration and test of the production and the pre-series calorimeter modules. The program is driven mainly by the need to ascertain the response of the modules over a variety tests such as (a) the exposure to the largest available energy beams,(b) the realization of combined runs with e.m. calorimeter in front etc., such that useful knowledge can be transported in the actual detector environment. Because technology choices in front-end electronics, read-out and triggering will have a deep impact on the performance of ATLAS, all these devices need to be fully understood. Test of possible upgrades in the electronics are also useful. The objectives of the test beam program are:

* Calibration of a fraction of the production modules
* Monitoring the stability of the optics and electronics
* Understanding linearity and low energy response of the combined calorimeter system

Based on the experience of other collaboration such CDF and ZEUS, the intercalibration of the calorimeter modules will be done using the \(Cs^{137}\) source. In order to check the 

#### 4.3.1 Experimental set-up

Measurements are performed in the H8 beam line in the North Area of the SPS at CERN. This is a high-energy general purpose beam, suitable for tests. In this area the maximum momentum of the proton beam is 450 GeV/c and an electron beam of 200 GeV/c. The beam size is a spot of about 2 cm of diameter.

The calorimeter modules are installed on a table that moves horizontally, perpendicular to the beam line. They can also be rotated on the vertical axis, allowing to change the angle \(\theta\), accessing the towers at different \(\eta\) values. The table can also be rotated around

Figure 4.7: CERN acceleratorsa horizontal axis, allowing to scan in the azimuthal incident angle (\(\phi\)). The set up used since 2000 Testbeam is shown in fig 4.8, where the Barrel module 0 is the bottom module mounted on the table, a production Barrel module is in the middle layer and finally, in the top layer are two Extended Barrels. Two possible beam incidence angle can also be seen.

Upstream of the calorimeter, scintillator are placed making a trigger counter telescope, defining a beam spot about 2 cm diameter. Two delay line wire chambers, each with x,y readout, allow to reconstruct the impact point of the beam particles on the calorimeter face. Cerenkov detectors in the beam line assist in the identification of the particles. Two layers of 2 cm thick scintillator, muon walls, installed in the table, one behind the modules and another laterally, allow the possibility to tag events as "longitudinal and/or lateral leakage" or "no leakage" and assist in the identification of muons.

#### Measurements in H8 beam

The basic program during test beam run is to measure the response of calorimeters to hadrons, electrons and muons in the energy range from 10 GeV to 180 GeV. A typical run plan for a given test beam period includes the following items:

Figure 4.8: Set up in the test beam.

* To set the EM scale in the Tile Calorimeter every accessible cell is exposed to the electron beams. Hence, all accessible cells with electron beam impact at 90 (-90) or 20 undergo the procedure to set/check EM scale. Usually 100 GeV electrons are used to measure the EM factor, also called pC/GeV ratio. Electrons at 20 GeV allow to use the High Gain circuitry and for higher energies the Low Gain circuitry is used.
* Muons have uniform energy deposition across the module, making them an unique tool to verify data obtained from the Cs\({}^{137}\) source measurements. Muons of 180 GeV energy entering Tile Cal modules at 90 degrees (-90 degrees) allow to cross-check radioactivity source calibration constants. Furthermore, muons in projective geometry are taken to _in situ_ experience in ATLAS.
* From the pion and electron signals as a function of beam energy, the e/h parameter, which is the ratio of the observed signal for the electromagnetic and non-electromagnetic components of a hadronic shower, is extracted. This parameter characterize the calorimeter and may be useful latter in calibrating jet response.
* Measures connected to calibration Triggers (CIS, Laser, and Minimum Bias)Chapter 5 Response of the production modules to radioactive source and muons during the 2000 and 2001 test beam periods.

For a reliable inter-calibration of the TileCal modules it is crucial to insure a tight correlation between the Cs response and the calibration constants measured with test beam particles. Since muons deposit energy rather uniformly along their path in matter, they are close to being a perfect tool for such verification. Responses of several TileCal modules against the muon beam are used in this chapter for comparison to the Cs calibration results. Both the Cs and the muon data used in this chapter were collected during the test beams of 2000 and 2001.

### 5.1 Characteristics of 2000 and 2001 Test Beams

The first stand-alone test of the production TileCal module, i.e modules which be installed in ATLAS detector, was performed in 2000 and the calibration program started in 2001. These date may be seen as the end of the TileCal R&D program and the beginning of it's commissioning.

#### 5.1.1 Modules characteristics.

Characteristics of the TileCal module components have changed somewhat through three year duration of the production process. The instrumentation technique has also undergo some changes. As a result the optical properties of the TileCal modules vary. Different modules, 7 in total, were chosen for the 2000 and 2001 test beams as representatives of several production sets of modules for which the materials properties and the instrumentation techniques are believed to have remained stable.

* EBC15: This module is assembled completely with PSM polystyrene at IFAE (ES). In order to study the aging effects and mechanical effects of moving the module between storage area and the TB area, this module underwent test beam calibrations both in the year 2000 and 2001.
* EBA06 (USA) and LB12 (RU/CH): Modules instrumented completely with PSM polystyrene.
* EBA15 (USA): Module assembled mostly with PSM polystyrene except for the cell D6 which is equipped with tiles made of BASF polystyrene.
* EBC38 (ES): Module done mostly with BASF polystyrene except for the sampling A, which is instrumented with the PSM one.
* EBC24 (ES): Module with samples A and B but tile row 7 equipped with PSM tiles and the rest with BASF tiles. The tiles of size 7 were painted with (2x22.5) mm strips at the edges of the tile. This was done to equalize light output for tiles made of two different types of polystyrene and mixed in the same cells. As planned the masking of the TR7 resulted in about (21-22)% drop in the light collected.
* LB18 (RU/CH): Module with samples A and B instrumented with PSM tiles and sample C and D equipped with BASF tiles. Tiles in sample C were masked.

#### 5.1.2 Testbeam characteristics.

As already mentioned, in the Testbeam set-up the modules to be tested were installed on a table which could move horizontally and vertically in the plane perpendicular to the beam line. The general positions of the modules on the table are shown on figures 5.1, 5.2 and 5.3, for different Testbeam periods.

The modules could also be rotated around the vertical axis, allowing to change the angle \(\theta\), acceding the different \(\eta\) values to be probed by the beam.

Figure 5.1: Set-up in August 2000

Figure 5.2: Set-up in August 2001

### 5.2 Measurement of cell responses from radioactive source data

All modules used in the test beam were equipped with the Cs calibration system. During the Cs scan modules response to the radioactive source is integrated with a RC constant of 2.7 msec and digitized every 10.0 msec.

The radioactive Cs\({}^{137}\) source emits 0.662 MeV photons. The photons emitted by the Cs source produce electrons by Compton scattering or photoelectric absorption. The electrons in turn ionize the medium through which they pass (source capsule, water and tube wall and the iron absorber of the calorimeter) until they are finally absorbed in the iron. Soft electrons created along the path of the photons are rapidly absorbed in the iron except those produced near the scintillators. The latter penetrate into tiles and excites light through a 3-steps process that involves the molecules of the scintillator dopant. The distance in iron penetrated by photons from the Cs source has been first estimated from Geant Monte-Carlo simulations. It was found to be about 15 mm for pure iron. Recently the direct measurement of the photon penetration distance was done for the realistic calorimeter medium, which is a mix of iron and plastic. It was found that about the 90% of the energy of the Cs photons is deposited in a circle of a diameter of 50 mm around the source tube[15]. Because of this range, the source excites several neighboring tiles as it passes through them.

Figure 5.3: Set-up in September 2001

#### Evaluation of the single tile response

As said, data from Cs\({}^{137}\) scans of a given Tilerow is usually a complex mix of responses from a group of several tiles in the Tilerow being transversal and the adjacent ones. The actual geometry of the modules and the Cs calibration system allows to estimate the fraction of signal that is deposited into each of the Tilerows[16]. It was calculated and later experimentally confirmed that when the source goes through the outer hole of the tiles, 78% of the radiation is deposited in that row of tiles. Approximately 21% of the radiation is collected from the row of tiles located radially outwards from the row being tested and 1% of the source energy is deposited in the row inward. The repeatability of these measurements was better than 0.5% and the systematic error estimated to be about 0.3%

In order to extract the individual tile response from the Cs data, a fitting procedure has been developed by Protvino group (E. Startchenko and A. Karioukhine)[17]. The sum of a Gaussian and a symmetric exponential contribution is used to fit the individual tile response of each peak in a Tilerow within a cell:

\[F_{i}\left(x\right)=A_{i}\cdot\left(G\cdot e^{-0.5\left(\frac{x-x_{i}}{\sigma }\right)^{2}}+\left(1-G\right)\cdot e^{\frac{-\left|x-x_{i}\right|}{\lambda}}\right)\]

where G (\(G<1\)) represents the fraction of the Gaussian part of the signal and (1-G) stands for the fraction of the exponential contribution.

In order to reduce the number of free parameters in the fit, about tree hundred dedicated measurements with only a single tile optically connected to the cell read-out were done. The data was used to evaluate \(G_{78}\),\(\sigma_{78}\),\(\lambda_{78}\) and \(G_{21}\),\(\sigma_{21}\),\(\lambda_{21}\) fit parameters in the independent way. Here, the 78 subscript stands for the case when the signal was taken from the same Tilerow through which the source was moved. The 21 subscript corresponds to the case when the signal was measured from the neighboring Tilerow. The obtained values of the parameters are listed in table 5.1, and were fixed when fitting the cell response.

To fit the Cs data for a given cell the so-called multi-tile fitting procedure is performed. It starts from the outer tube data, which corresponds to a pure 78% case, since no neighboring tiles contribute to the measured signal. The parameters \(G_{78}\),\(\sigma_{78}\) and \(\lambda_{78}\) are fixed to the values given in the table 5.1. The only free parameters in the above fit are the peak positions and amplitudes for all the tiles (x\({}_{i}^{Outer\ tube}\), A\({}_{i}^{Outer\ tube}\)). The error on theamplitudes is estimated to be approximately 1% in this case. The obtained response from the outer tube is used to estimate the "radiation leak" from the next Tilerow. In other words, 0.21/0.78 part of the signal seen in the outer Tilerow is expected to contaminate the signal of the neighboring Tilerow at the next inner radius. Thus the signal from the outer Tilerow is re-calculated using peak amplitudes and positions (A\({}_{i}^{Outertube}\), x\({}_{i}^{Outertube}\)) and the set of parameters associated with the leakage structures \(G_{21}\),\(\sigma_{21}\) and \(\lambda_{21}\). Then it is scaled down by the factor 0.21/0.78 and subtracted from the signal measured in the next Tilerow to purify it before the fit. After subtracting the estimated leakage contribution, the next (neighboring) Tilerow source data is ready to be fitted as a pure case, using \(G_{78}\),\(\sigma_{78}\) and \(\lambda_{78}\). The fitting errors on the amplitudes are therefore accumulated and are estimated to be approximately 2% for the second fit. The fitting procedure repeats itself until the fit is done for the data from the innermost Tilerow in the cell.

An example of the measured signal when the source passes Tilerow 1 is shown in figure 5.4. Three different distributions are shown. The highest one corresponds to the raw signal measured when the source goes through tile row one. Note that this distribution includes the leakage into the tiles of row two. The smallest distribution corresponds to the estimated leakage signal, which will be subtracted from the first one. The result of the subtraction is the pure 78% case, which on the plot corresponds to the distribution in the middle. The black dots are the fitted peak amplitudes.

As a next step, the mean value for each _TR-segment_ is calculated, using the peak amplitudes. In order to calculate the mean response for each cell, mean values of each _TR-segment_ are taken and weighted in accordance to the number of tiles in that tile row. For example, in the cell A1, which has 14 tiles in the tile row 1, 13 tiles in the tile row 2 and 14 tiles in the tile row 3, the mean response will be:

\[I_{A1}=\frac{(14\cdot I_{1}+13\cdot I_{2}+14\cdot I_{3})}{(14+13+14)}\]

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|} \hline \multicolumn{1}{|c|}{78\% case} & \multicolumn{1}{|c|}{21\% case} \\ \hline \hline \(G_{78}\)= 0.52\(\pm\)0.02 & \(G_{21}\)=0.14\(\pm\) 0.10 \\ \hline \(\sigma_{78}\)= 4.82\(\pm\) 0.14 mm & \(\sigma_{21}\)= 3.43 \(\pm\)1.39 mm \\ \hline \(\lambda_{78}\)=21.60\(\pm\) 0.46 mm & \(\lambda_{21}\) =24.81\(\pm\) 1.42 mm \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 5.1: Fit parameters used to perform the multi-tile fits of raw Cesium data where \(I_{1}\),\(I_{2}\) and \(I_{3}\) are the mean values from tile row 1, 2 and 3 (_TR-segment_ response) respectively. Finally the overall mean response (of which \(I_{A1}\) is an exemple) is used to set the high voltage for each PMT.

A new, more detailed study of the single tile response to the Cs source was done in May of 2001. The measurement was performed on the Barrel module only. The result was a new set of parameters for each tile size: \(G_{78}\),\(\sigma_{78}\), \(\lambda_{78}\), \(G_{21}\),\(\sigma_{21}\) and \(\lambda_{21}\)[18]. It will be shown in this work that using tile dependent set of the Cs fitting parameters one obtains better agreement between Cs data and the TB results for muons. Therefore the new Cs method gives a more precise picture of Cs source data and improves the accuracy of the Cs calibration procedure. It will also be shown that using the new set of the Cs parameters one eliminates a systematic shift between Cs and muon data for the outermost Tilerow in every cell.

#### Repeatability of the _TR-segment_ response in the Cesium data

The repeatability of the measurement of the _TR-segment_ response was calculated from three different source runs. Runs 21220, 21221 and 21238 for the Extended Barrels were

Figure 5.4: The pure Cesium signal is obtained after the imitated leakage signal has been subtracted from the raw data. The fitted peak amplitudes (the dots) are also plotted.

used. They all were taken during the 2000 Testbeam. To estimate the variance in the _TR-segment_ response, the average and the rms of each _TR-segment_ response from three runs were calculated. Normalizing the rms values to the average responses, an average rms of 0.3 % was obtained as it is shown in figure 5.5.

#### HV setting procedure

The goal of the High Voltage setting procedure is to adjust the gains of all photo-tubes so that the responses of different parts of the calorimeter are equalized to a precision of \(<2\%\). The precision of the High Voltage setting will have a direct impact on the TileCal energy resolution. Continuous studies and checks are done to improve the accuracy of this procedure.

The first step of the High Voltage setting procedure is to set all PMTs at the nominal gain of \(10^{5}\) within a precision of \(\pm\) 5% using the high voltage values that were determined in the laboratory bench tests. Then a source run is taken, and the response of each cell as it is seen by each PMT is calculated. In the next steps the HV are varied until the PMT response seen in the Cs scans reaches the target value within the precision of 0.3%[19]. The details of the procedure have changed from Testbeam 2000 to Testbeam 2001.

Figure 5.5: Distribution of the normalized variation in the _TR-segment_ responses taken from three cesium runs in the Extended Barrel modules.

* _TB00_: In the year 2000 the response of each cell was represented by the mean of the single tile responses in a single Tilerow. Responses of Tilerows 2,5 and 10 were used to adjust PMT gains in samples A, B and D respectively. Since only a single tile row from each cell was used the effect of other tile rows within a cell was not taken into account.
* _TB01_: In the year 2001 the response of each cell was calculated as the mean of the single tile responses within the whole cell. Though more CPU time is needed in such approach, the cell response is represented in more uniform way. The latter statement will be directly proved by the analysis done in this work.

#### Study of the _TR-segment_ response from the Cesium source data

All the results presented in this chapter were obtained with the data taken after the gain setting procedure was finished. A list of the Cs runs, used in the analysis, is given in table 5.2.

The tile size dependence of the _TR-segment_ response in the Cs\({}^{137}\) scans of different modules is shown in figures 5.6, 5.7 and 5.8. Signals from the two PMTs connected to a given cell are averaged to represent the _TR-segment_ responses. In general the order of the error in the Cs\({}^{137}\) data is only of 0.3%.

\begin{table}

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:65]

Let us make a few observations on these data:

* There is a difference in the value of ADC counts between data taken during 2000 and 2001. In the year 2001 the signal is about 4/5 smaller than in the year 2000. The decrease originates from the new scaling factor -in practise different resistors-introduced in the read-out chain to match output dynamic range of the integrators, 5V, to the input dynamic range of the ADC, 4.095 V[20].
* The dispersion in the Cs signal for a given tile size depends on the procedure used for the HV setting. For modules tested during the Testbeam of 2000 (figure 5.6), tile rows 2, 5 and 10, which were used to set HV, are normally characterized by smaller RMS dispersions. Typically the RMS in these tile rows is about 1%. In contrast, RMSs for other, not used in HV setting, Tilerows are about 3%. On the other hand, for modules tested during 2001 (figures 5.7 and 5.8), where the means

of cell responses were used for HV equalization, all the tile rows inside a sample have similar values of RMS, which in average is 1.8%.
* The average tile row response as a function of Tilerow has an intrinsic structure for all the modules tested in the year 2000. This structure is due to the different light budget for different Tilerows[21]. The light budget for a given Tilerow is a function of the tile size and the fiber length which belong to the Tilerow. Another source which contributes to this structure is the HV equalization procedure. An example is the module EBC15, which was tested both years.

To characterize the overall quality of the HV equalization procedure, the dispersion among responses _from all the TR-segments_ can be calculated. This quantity will also be affected by the instrumentation effects. The resulting RMSs calculated on Cs data for each module tested are given in table 5.3.

The dispersion of the TR-segment responses within each module is about 40 % smaller in 2001 that in 2000 due to improvements in the HV setting procedure.

## 5 Measurements of the cell responses from muon beam data

Muon data provide complementary information to the radioactive source calibration data. High energy muons deposit their energy rather uniformly along their trajectory in iron. Thus the Cs\({}^{137}\) source data can be verified by the so-called 90 degree muon data. In such a mode muons impinge at 90 degrees to the tile plane in the center of tile, producing an uniform signal along the whole path through the given Tilerow. This allows to measure the response to muons for each TR-segment of a TileCal module.

Description of the muon signal extraction is given below.

#### Data overview

The signal from each PMT passes through a shaper circuit before been fed to the ADC where the signal is sampled every 25 nsec. Nine samples per event per channel are stored in the raw data. To calculate the energy deposited, the sum of the five highest samples (from (sample-2) to (sample+2) around the highest sample0) is calculated. The result is corrected by a set of coefficients to transform the signal measured by the ADC to the energy deposited in the calorimeter in GeV. These coefficients are obtained from charge calibration runs, which convert ADC counts to pC the charge integral of the PMT signal; Cesium runs, which normally give correction factor close to one; and the electron data, which converts pC to GeV. The latest factor is obtained from the module response to electrons, whose original energy is known to great precision.

The online Testbeam data is analyzed with a software known as Tilemon [22]. After appropriate corrections are applied the data are stored into ntuples, where all the information related to the run is kept on an event by event basis.

Results presented in this chapter were obtained using muon data from several runs taken during the 2000-2001 Testbeam periods. A list of these runs and their characteristics is given in table 5.4.

The two first columns of this table contain modules identity and the date when the module was exposed to the beam. The third one has the range of used runs. There are eleven runs per module, one for each tile row (except for the barrel module tested in August 2001 when only ten runs were taken). Normally the runs were taken consecutively with rare exceptions. For example, in September 2001, the runs are from 12370 to 12372(for tile rows from 1 to 3) and from 120378 to 120385 (for tile rows from 4 to 11). Finally the last three columns contain information about the type of particles, at which angle theta the beam was inserted and which was the energy of the particles.

**Event selection**

It is common practice in high energy physics analysis to select events of interest from the pool of originally stored events. In our case the events of interest are well collimated muons. Applying certain selection criteria, also known as cuts, we intend to suppress events which might otherwise bias the Calorimeter response.

Although the beam is fairly focused, there are always off-angle particles due to the particle interactions to collimators and other beam optic elements. These events should not be considered in the analysis. For this reason a set of general cuts, based on position information from the beam chambers, is applied.

Before reaching the calorimeter muons have to pass two beam chambers, BC1 and BC2 (figure 5.9), that give information about X and Y coordinates of the beam. Using the x and y coordinates of a particle from each chamber (x1, y1 and x2, y2), the X and Y impact coordinate (Ximp and Yimp) at the face of calorimeter is calculated [22]. These two variables are used to keep only the collimated part of the beam for latter analysis. Example of the X and Y impact coordinate distribution is shown in figure 5.10, where every point corresponds to a single event (particle).

Since the off-angle muons have a longer path in the modules they deposit more energy, because the deposited energy is proportional to the length of the muon trajectory. Hence they have to be rejected from the analysis. The rejected events are those for which X and

**Modules** & Period & Runs & Beam & Theta & Energy \\  & of TB & range & particle & angle & beam \\ \hline \hline EBC15,EBA06 & Aug00 & 52024-52041 & muon & +90 & 150GeV \\ \hline LB12A & Aug00 & 52016-52026 & muon & +90 & 150GeV \\ \hline EBC38,EBA15 & Aug01 & 110468-110472 & muon & +90 & 180GeV \\  & & 110480-110485 & electron & & \\ \hline LB18C,LB18A & Aug01 & 110437-40—110443-48 & electron & -90 & 180GeV \\ \hline EBC15,EBC24 & Sep01 & 120370-72—120378-85 & muon & +90 & 180GeV \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 5.4: Runs used in the analysis Y impact coordinates deviate from the their mean value by more than 1.5 times the rms of the distribution. In general this cut removes about 25% of the original events.

Other selection criteria to obtain well collimated event sample were investigated. The results were unsensitive (less than 1% difference) to a particular choice of the cuts.

Figure 5.9: Drawing of the Testbeam setup. Two beam chambers are shown in front of the calorimeter.

**Selection of muon events**

Muons, entering the module front plane at 90 degrees allows us to obtain the muon response for each tile size with the same granularity as with the cesium source. Although the beam under consideration is called a muon beam, it may be heavily contaminated by other particles, mainly electrons and pions. Since the profiles of the energy distribution deposited by muons, electrons and pions are different, one has to select only muon events in order not to bias the muon energy distribution.

For the 2000 Testbeam, muon runs were used for the analysis. It was not possible to take a set of muon runs in the August 2001 Testbeam period. The muon contamination within the electron beam was used in this case.

The way in which electrons, pions and muons deposit their energy in the calorimeter is very different. Unlike electrons or pions, muons propagate along both modules depositing about 1.5 GeV per meter. Therefore, after the two Extended or the Barrel module, the energy deposited is less than 6% of their typical original energy. For a beam energy of 180 GeV, the most likely energy deposited by muons is less than 10 GeV. On the other hand, electrons deposit all its energy in the first module they hit, and pions deposit most of their energy un that module.

A soft cut rejects events in which the energy deposited in the first module is larger than 50 GeV.

**Rejection of the pile-up events**

In the usual data acquisition mode at the test beam, the voltage output of the amplifier is sampled and digitized 9 times, where the higher sample is the forth or fifth one (see figure 5.11). As already mentioned, the energy deposited is calculated adding the five samples with the highest signal.

Figure 5.11: example of the signal of a PMT.

**Response of the production modules to radioactive source and muons during the 2000 and 2001 test beam periods.**

In 2001 data, the beam intensity had reached a point when first pile-up events were detected. These are the events distant by less than 200 nsec in time. The energy deposition of one of them is effected by another. An example of an event with a pile-up contribution is shown in figure 5.12, where the highest sample is the first one, normally used for a pedestal calculation. Events effected by pile-up must be rejected.

Information from the nine samples is used to to reject events contaminated by the pile-up. The cut rejects events with the first or the ninth sample differing from the average value of the pedestal distribution (see figure 5.13) by more than 15 times the rms of the distribution. Typically, about 4-8% of the events were removed by this cut.

Typical efficiency of 65% (5%) were found after applying all the selection cuts to muon (electron) runs.

#### Fit to the distribution of the energy deposited by muons

Let us consider a minimum ionizing particle (mip) passing through a thin block of matter; its energy loss distribution obeys the Landau probability density function. Muon of 150 or

Figure 5.12: example of the signal of a PMT with a pile-up contamination.

Figure 5.13: example of signal of a PMT with no event.

180 GeV, such as in our test beam, are above the mip regime, and also deposit in the iron of Tilecal appreciable energies by radioactive process. However the distribution of energy deposited in the scintillator can still usefully be represented by a Landau distribution.

The light originated in the scintillator is absorbed in the wavelength shifting fiber, re-emitted at a large wavelength and conducted to the photomultiplier. Finally, the photons reaching the photocathode interact with its material and liberate the electrons. Moreover, the final signal is influenced by the pedestal spread. All these effects are of a statistical nature; therefore the original energy loss distribution will be smeared by a Gaussian due to the above fluctuations. Taking all that into account, muon energy deposited in a cell distribution has been fitted by the convolution of a Landau and a Gaussian distribution:

\[S_{i}\left(x|p_{1},p_{2},p_{3},p_{4}\right)=p_{1}\times\int\limits_{-\infty}^{ \infty}L\left(\frac{y-p_{2}}{0.5860\times p_{3}}\right)\exp\left(-\frac{\left( x-y\right)^{2}}{2p_{4}^{2}}\right)dy\]

where the first parameter is a normalization factor and the second and third parameters correspond to the Landau distribution and the last one describes the Gaussian smearing. This integral has no analytic solution and therefore has to be calculated numerically. After the fit procedure, the peak position of the distribution, also known as most probable (MOP) value, and its error are calculated. The peak position is found analytically as the maximum of the fitted function. In order to calculate the error, not only the parameter errors have been taken, but also the correlation between them. In general, for all fits done, the error in the peak position was only of 0.5%. More detailed information about the fit function can be found in [23]. An example of the fit, with the computed peak and width values and their errors, is given in figure 5.14.

The quality of the fit is characterized by the \(\chi^{2}\) value. In general the \(\chi^{2}\) per degree of freedom for all the fits is close to one, indicating the right choice of the fit function.

#### Repeatability of the measurement of the _TR-segment_ response for muons

Like for the Cesium data, the repeatability of the measurement of the _TR-segment_ response can be measured by calculating the variation between the _TR-segment_ responsesfrom three different muon runs in the Extended Barrel modules. The list of the muon runs used can be found in table 5.5. The resulting distribution is shown in figure 5.15. The repeatability of the measurement of the _TR-segment_ response for muons is found to be 0.8%.

#### Check on the Left and Right signal symmetry

One of the features of the Tilecal Calorimeter is that a pair of wavelengths shifting fibers runs radially collecting light from tiles at both sides of their \(\phi\) edges. An illustrative

The asymmetry between two PMT readouts can be parameterized in the following way:

\[A=\frac{S_{Left}-S_{Right}}{S_{Left}+S_{Right}}\]

where S\({}_{Left}\) and S\({}_{Right}\) are two signals read out from the two sides of the cell.

The _TR-segment_ in a module is a function of the tile size, and the _TR-segment_ in a module. The results, as a function of the tile size, are shown in figures 5.17, 5.18, 5.19, and 5.20 for the modules tested in 2000, the Extended Barrel modules tested in August 2001, the Extended Barrel modules tested in September 2001 and the Barrel modules tested in August 2001, respectively. The asymmetry is plotted vs tile number, and the average asymmetry per tile size and the corresponding dispersion are calculated. In general, the error in the asymmetry value is less than 0.02.

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:78]

To summarize:

* In the year 2000 data, there was a significant asymmetry in the modules response to muons of \(\sim\)5%. At the same time no significant asymmetry was found in the Cs data (see figure 5.21).

Hance, the PMT gains were well equalized between two sides of the module. The asymmetry in the muon data was attributed to the fact that the beam was displaced by about 3 cm from the center of the tile. In the year 2001 dedicated beam position sensors[24] were introduced into the TB set-up to correct for possible beam displacement.
* In the year 2001 data, a smaller asymmetry was detected. It was only about 2.3% in EB modules, in +90 degrees muon data. For the Barrel module, in \(\pm\)90 degrees muon runs, the asymmetry was between 1.5% and 0.4%. A possible table mis

alignment with respect to the beam line could be blamed for this effect. Still it is not yet confirmed by an independent analysis. The difference in asymmetries between +90 and -90 degrees data appears due to the fact that the table is tilted \(\sim\)1 mrad along the beam axis[25].

To cancel the an effect of these asymmetries from our analysis we consider an average from signals obtained by two PMTs connected to the cell as a signal from given _TR-segment_. In this framework any asymmetry is eliminated independently of its origin, because the summed _TR-segment_ response is uniform within few percent[26] across the whole tile surface.

#### Truncated mean instead of the peak value

As already said, all distributions of the energy deposited in the cells by muons have been fitted by the convolution of Landau and Gaussian distributions. The peak value, also known as MOP parameter, has been extracted from the fit. The size of the cell (number of periods or tiles) varies along the tile row inside the module. The smallest cell (D4) in the Extended Barrel modules has five periods while the largest one (D6) has 75 periods. To compare responses from the cells of different sizes the peak value is divided by the number of tiles within the _TR-segment_. For the Cs data, the response of all tiles in a _TR-segment_ is averaged too.

The Landau distribution, as any asymmetric distribution with the tail in the high

values, has the property that the sum of peak values of Landau distributions is smaller than the peak value obtained of the sum of Landau distributions:

\[\sum_{i}peak\left(L_{i}\right)\quad<\quad peak\left(\sum_{i}L_{i}\right)\]

In other words the peak value of the Landau distribution is not an additive statistical variable. Hence normalizing it to the cell size, when the size varies significantly, will introduce a systematic size dependence.

In order to obtain from the muon data sample a variable suitable for comparison with the Cs signals, which are additive by definition, an alternative estimator was looked for.

It is known that the Mean of any distribution is an additive statistical variable, independently of the distribution shape. However, for a distribution like Landau, which has a long tail, the Mean is not a robust estimator because is unstable against fluctuations in the tail. In these cases, it is better to "ignore" a certain fraction of the measurements in the tails. So the alternative method to define the _TR-segment_ response to muons, which was finally used in our analysis, is the so-called _truncated mean_.

The truncated mean may be more stable than finding peak by fitting but unfortunately is not normalized to the cell size like MOP parameter.

We decided to use the truncated mean because as will be shown in chapter 6, the truncated mean seems to provide a more precise correlation of the muon signal with the Cs response.

The precise definition of the truncated mean used in our analysis follows. The high energy tail of the muon deposited energy distribution was cut off at the 5.5 times the peak position to reduce statistical fluctuations in the mean value of remaining energy distribution. The choice of the cut will be discussed in the next chapter. The mean value of the energy distribution remaining after the cut is defined as _TR-segment_ response to muons. We will use the above definition from here on. An illustrative drawing of the truncated mean calculation is given in figure 5.22.

#### Study of the _TR-segment_ response to muons

Several cells were discarded from the analysis because of problems in one of the PMTs readouts. The list of the discarded cells is given in table 5.6.

All the C10 and D4 cells of the Extended Barrel modules were excluded from the analysis since Cs data extraction is not yet tuned for these cells. All the D0 cell of the Barrel modules were also excluded since they are read out by a single PMT/drawer and the data might be strongly distorted by the beam been displaced from the center of the tile.

For every _TR-segment_ in a module, the _TR-segment_ response to muons was calculated

\end{table}
Table 5.6: Cells not used in the analysis using the truncated mean method. The results are shown in figures 5.23, 5.24 and 5.25. The _TR-segment_ responses are plotted vs tile number. The average response within tile row and the corresponding RMS dispersion are calculated. In general, the error in the _TR-segment_ response values is less than 0.7% except for the data extracted from electron runs, where there is not much statistic. In these last cases the error is \(\geq 1\%\).

The information from these three figures can be summarized as follows:

* Unlike to the cesium results, there is no clear improvement seen in the HV setting procedure from the year 2000 to 2001. According to the muon results in the year 2000 data the tile rows with the smallest RMS are not always those used for the HV equalization (2, 5 and 10)(figure 5.23). This is a first indication that the correlation between Cs and muon data is not perfect. For modules tested during 2001 (figures 5.24 and 5.25), where the mean of cells were used to HV equalization instead of a specific tile row, generally all the tile rows have similar values of RMS.
* Similarly to what is observed in cesium data, structure representing the _TR-segment_ light budget and imperfections of the HV setting procedure is seen in the muon results for the Extended Barrel modules tested in the year 2000.
* In general, the dispersion within the corresponding tile row using muon data is roughly 10% bigger than using cesium data. This is another hint of the imperfection of Cs-muon correlation. Such observations emphasize the importance of cross-checking any modification in the Cs data extraction procedure versus the real (muon) data.

To characterize the overall uniformity of the TileCal module response to muons, the dispersion between all _TR-segments_ within given module has been calculated. The results are presented in table 5.7 for every module tested.

It can be seen that in the year 2001, when the new HV setting procedure was used, the uniformity of the TR-segment response to muons became about 34% better than in the year 2000.

### 5.4 Conclusions

The results presented in this chapter have shown correlation between module responses to the cesium source and to muons. A variation between different averaged tile row response (the both Cs and muon) is observed. This is expected because of light budget variations between tile rows. Also, a difference between cells, probably due to erroneous HV setting, is found.

Two different methods to equalize the response of the modules were used during Testbeam 2000 and Testbeam 2001. Source and muon results have shown that the method used in 2001 improves the equalization response. With the method of 2001 the dispersion of the Cs source signal between _TR-segments_ is within 3%. This is turn assures that the contribution to the constant term of the energy resolution will be small.

From the muon signal the module response uniformity is about 30% worse than with Cs signal. Is important to note that the module response equalization is done using Cs signal and the energy deposition mechanism and the area size of the tile, where the energy is deposited, differ for the Cs source and muons. It is therefore not surprising that with the radioactive source a better uniformity is observed.

## Chapter 6 Comparison of the modules response to the \({}^{137}\)Cs source and to muons.

All modules will be calibrated using the cesium source. Only one in eight of them will undergo calibration at the Testbeams. For those modules that will not be calibrated with particles, a method to set the absolute energy scale has to be found. The proposed technique is to use the data from the \({}^{137}\)Cs source scans, available for all the modules, to transfer the absolute energy scale from the modules exposed to the Testbeams to the rest of the modules.

In the previous chapter the procedure to extract the modules response to the radioactive source and to muons was given. In this section, a comparison of the two responses will be presented for the TileCal modules tested in the years 2000 and 2001. At the end of the chapter, the conclusion on the accuracy of the propagation of the calibration constants using cesium constants will be given.

### 6.1 Comparison of the responses to muons and to cesium source

For Tile Calorimeter, the inter calibration of the calorimeter modules is performed using the Cs\({}^{137}\) source. Since the energy deposition mechanism differs for the Cs\({}^{137}\) source and the realistic particles the calibration done with the Cs\({}^{137}\) source has to be checked. Thecheck is performed within the geometrical volume of each _TR-segment_ using the modules response to the muons impinging at \(\theta=\)90 degrees. To compare _TR-segment_ responses to muons and to the source we introduce two variables, called hereinafter as Single Ratio and Double Ratio.

#### The Single Ratio

We define the Single Ratio (S) as the ratio of the muon response to the Cs\({}^{137}\) response for a given _TR-segment_ of the module. In such definition some systematic effects, like differences in the tile sizes and fiber lengths belonging to different Tilerows or their dispersion within the corresponding Tilerow because of the HV setting, are cancelled out. For each _TR-segment_ in a module, the Single Ratio is studied as a function of the Tilerow (tile size). The results are shown in figures 6.1, 6.2 and 6.3, where the units of the Single Ratio are 10 eV/ADC counts. In general, the error in the Single Ratio values is less than 0.8% except for the data extracted from electron runs, where there is not much statistic. In these last cases the error is \(\geq 1\%\).

The information from these figures can be summarized as follows:

* In general, the dispersion within the corresponding Tilerow is smaller for the Single Ratio than for the muon data alone. Hence, there is a positive correlation between muon and radioactive source data.
* There are some cells, for example cell B11 in EBC24 or A12 in EBC38, which have lower or higher Single Ratio value than the other cells for all respective Tilerows. This effect was traced down to the CIS corrections been badly applied to the raw muon data.
* A peculiar structure in the average Tilerow response is observed in the Extended Barrel modules, specially in sample D. This effect was traced down to the procedure of extracting responses from the cesium raw data and will be discussed later in more details.

## Chapter 6 Comparison of the responses to muons and to cesium source

Figure 6.2: Single Ratio of _TR-segment_ vs Tilerow, for the EB modules tested in the 2001 Testbeam. Different colors represent different samples (A, B and D for Extended Barrel and A, B, C and D for Barrel). Within each Tilerow the mean and the rms for all _TR-segments_ have been calculated.

#### The Double Ratio

In order to eliminate from consideration any additional systematics effects, like differences due to the electronics responsible for the readout of muon and Cs\({}^{137}\) signals, the _TR-segment_ responses to muons and Cs\({}^{137}\) are normalized to the average response of the cell before calculating the ratio. This new variable is called Double Ratio (R). An example of calculating the Double Ratio for the _TR-segment_ in Tilerow 2 within cell A15 is given,

\[R(A15,tr2)=\frac{muon(A15,tr2)/muon(A15)}{Cs(A15,tr2)/Cs(A15)}\]

Like the Single ratio before, the Double Ratio is used to study the agreement between muon and Cs\({}^{137}\) responses. The results for the 2000 Testbeam data are shown in figure 6.4 where Double Ratio for each _TR-segment_ is plotted vs Tilerow. The average and the dispersion within the corresponding Tilerow are also calculated.

Figure 6.3: Single Ratio of _TR-segment_ vs Tilerow, for the Barrel modules tested in the 2001 Testbeam. Different colors represent different samples (A, B and D for Extended Barrel and A, B, C and D for Barrel). Within each Tilerow the mean and the rms for all _TR-segments_ have been calculated.

If can be seen from the plots that in general the Double Ratio value is close to one, as would be expected muon and cesium data were perfectly corrected. A noticeable exception can be found in every last Tilerow of each sample. The Tilerows 3,7 and 11 for the Extended Barrel and the Tilerows 3,9 and 11 for the Barrel modules are characterized by a Double Ratio average value of about 4% (or more) smaller than in other Tilerows. These results were presented to the collaboration. The procedure to extract Cs signal

from the raw data was re-considered. A new, more accurate, set of parameters (already presented in the Chapter 5) to describe cesium data for the Barrel modules was introduced. After applying the new procedure to the cesium data the agreement between muon and radioactive source results was improved, as is shown in figure 6.5.

Figure 6.5: Double Ratio (calculated using the new set of parameters to describe the radioactive source data) for _TR-segment_ vs Tilerow, for modules tested in the 2000 Test-beam. Different colors represent different samples (A, B and D for Extended Barrel and A, B, C and D for Barrel). Within each Tilerow the mean and the rms for all _TR-segments_ have been calculated.

The new set of parameters to describe the radioactive source data was worked out on the data collected with the barrel module. As a result, the systematic steps in the last Tilerow inside of each sample have disappeared for the Barrel modules. For the Extended Barrel modules, the systematic steps became smaller but were not eliminated completely. As seen from figure 6.5, there is a difference of about 6% between signal value in Tilerow 8 and Tilerow 11.

The new method to evaluate the single tile response to a radioactive source includes the dependence in the tile size. This new set of parameters take into account the step in the tile size between tiles of different samples. The radial dimension of tiles changes from 97mm to 187mm in this way:

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|} \hline Tiles size & Sample & Radial dimension (mm) \\ \hline \hline
1,2,3 & A & 97 \\ \hline
4,5,6 & B & 127 \\ \hline
7,8,9 & C & 147 \\ \hline
10,11 & D & 187 \\ \hline \end{tabular}

These differences in size affect the estimated leakage signal, which should be subtracted of the signal measured when the source goes through tile row. The studies did by E.Startchenko [18] shown that the old procedure to evaluate the signal underestimated the tile response in the last tile row of each sample, for these reasons the new method improve the results.

Similar results were obtained with the modules tested during the 2001 Testbeam (see figure 6.6 for Extended Barrel and figure 6.7 for Barrel modules). The new set of parameters to describe the radioactive source data was applied to the Cs data for both types of modules.

The systematic structure seen for all the Extended Barrel modules tested suggests that a new study of the parameter set needs to be done for the Extended Barrel modules alone because the endplates and ITC effect on the response evaluation might be much stronger than in the Barrel modules.

Different colors represent different samples (A, B and D for Extended Barrel and A, B, C and D for Barrel). Within each Tilerow the mean and the rms for all _TR-segments_ have been calculated.

### 6.2 Study of the module to module variations of the muon and Cs signals

It is expected that the module response to a radioactive source or particle beam are sensitive to any difference in the optics properties of the given module. For example, two modules instrumented by using different polystyrene base material would have different light yields. It is important to insure that such a difference will effect both Cs response and the muon response of the module in the same way. As a result, the Single Ratio value should stay unchanged from module to module independently from the instrumentation differences between these modules. The average of the Single Ratio per module was calculated. For modules exposed to test beams in the year 2000, the value of the Single Ratio was corrected by the factor 5000/4095 (as explained in Chapter 5). The results are given in table 6.1.

Figure 6.7: Double Ratio for _TR-segment_ vs Tilerow, for the Barrel modules tested in the 2001 Testbeam. Different colors represent different samples (A, B and D for Extended Barrel and A, B, C and D for Barrel). Within each Tilerow the mean and the rms for all _TR-segments_ have been calculated.

In general, for modules tested in 2001, the Single Ratio is \(1.82\pm 1\) except for module EBC38, where an unexpected high value is found. Also for modules tested in 2000 the Single Ratio values are smaller than for modules tested in 2001. On the other hand, as catalogued in table 6.1, the RMS dispersion between all _TR-segment_ is bigger for Barrel modules than Extended Barrel modules.

Several dedicated studies in search for an explanation of the variations in the Single ratio value were carried out. The studies included not only variations in the tile material but also the differences in the Testbeam setup.

#### Difference in tile materials

As already said in the previous chapters, there are differences between modules as a consequence of the change in materials during the production of tiles. The tile production was done in 4 periods or batch. In the first batch 10.080 tiles of each size were produced (25%). In the second batch the tiles production of sizes 1, 2 and 3 was finished. In this moment, in the production had a change in the tile base material (from PSM to BASF polystyrene). Finally, the batch 3 and 4 were made, which correspond to tile sizes from 4 to 11. The tiles made of BASF polystyrene give us about 20% more light comparing to those made from PSM base material. In the modules in which the BASF material was used for the Tilerows 4 to 11, tiles of sizes 1 to 3 were made of PSM polystyrene, as always. Though it was general instrumentation strategy not to mix tiles made of different base materials in the same cell, there are several modules in which it was not possible to

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|} \hline Module & Year & Single Ratio & RMS\% \\ \hline \hline EBC15 & 2000 & 1.78\(\pm\)0.01 & 2.7\(\pm\)0.3 \\ \hline EBA06 & 2000 & 1.76\(\pm\)0.01 & 2.5\(\pm\)0.4 \\ \hline LB12A & 2001 & 1.71\(\pm\)0.01 & 3.4\(\pm\)0.3 \\ \hline EBC38 & 2001 & 1.91\(\pm\)0.01 & 2.5\(\pm\)0.3 \\ \hline EBA15 & 2001 & 1.82\(\pm\)0.01 & 2.4\(\pm\)0.3 \\ \hline EBC15 & 2001 & 1.82\(\pm\)0.01 & 2.3\(\pm\)0.3 \\ \hline EBC24 & 2001 & 1.83\(\pm\)0.01 & 2.3\(\pm\)0.2 \\ \hline LB18A & 2001 & 1.83\(\pm\)0.01 & 2.9\(\pm\)0.2 \\ \hline LB18C & 2001 & 1.80\(\pm\)0.01 & 3.0\(\pm\)0.2 \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 6.1: Single Ratio average for each module follow this rule. Tiles of different materials were mixed in the same cells of the second sample in several modules. In such cases the BASF tiles were painted over about 20% of the edge along which the fibers are laid, in order to bring the light output down to the level of the PSM tiles. The technique is known as masking.

A list of the material composition for all studied modules is given in table 6.2.

If the module response to the radioactive source and particles beam depend in the same way to the modules composition, the Single Ratio value should be independent of the tile material. A study was done to check this hypothesis.

For all the modules the average of the Single Ratio for all _TR-segment_ within a Tilerow is plotted vs tile number in figure 6.8 (Extended Barrel modules) and figure 6.9 (Barrel modules).

The following observations can be made on the plots presented above:

* The Single Ratio for the two Extended Barrel modules tested in the beam in 2000 is about 2% smaller than for the modules exposed to particles in 2001. Module EBC38 has about 4% higher value of the Single Ratio than other modules tested in the 2001 Testbeam for all the Tilerows. This difference is independent of the type of polystyrene used for the instrumentation. The fact that this high signal is seen in all Tilerows rules out the difference in the tile materials as a possible source of explanation.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|} \hline Module & PSM Tilerows & BASF Tilerows & BASF Tilerows \\  & & (without masking) & (with masking) \\ \hline \hline EBC15 & from 1 to 11 & - & - \\ \hline EBA06 & from 1 to 11 & - & - \\ \hline EBA15 & from 1 to 11 & from 8 to 11 & - \\  & (except D-6) & (cell D-6) & \\ \hline EBC24 & from 1 to 6 & from 7 to 11 & 7 \\ \hline EBC38 & from 1 to 3 & from 4 to 11 & - \\ \hline LB12A & from 1 to 11 & - & - \\ \hline LB18A & from 1 to 6 & from 7 to 11 & from 7 to 9 \\ \hline LB18C & from 1 to 6 & from 7 to 11 & from 7 to 9 \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 6.2: Material composition for each module * For the Extended Barrel module EBC24, in which Tilerow 7 was masked, no significant difference in the value of the Single Ratio was found with respect to the Single Ratio of this Tilerow in other modules.
* Like the Extended Barrel modules, the Barrel module tested in 2000 has an average Single Ratio smaller than the ones tested in 2001. This difference for Barrels is about 5% (and even higher for Tilerows 10 and 11). Furthermore, the value of the average Single Ratio for all the Tilerows for half of the Barrel module, LB18A, is higher than for the second half, LB18C.

Figure 6.8: Average Single Ratio per Tilerow for the Extended Barrel modules vs Tilerow. Each symbol represents a module. The black symbol corresponds to the Tilerows instrumented with BASF polystyrene base material.

In search of an explanation for differences in the value of the Single Ratio, the responses of some modules (three Extended Barrel modules and three half parts of the Barrel modules) were compared separately for Cs\({}^{137}\) and muon data. The results are shown in figure 6.10 and 6.11, where the average values for all _TR-segments_ within a TileRow (normalized to one using the average of all modules plotted) are plotted vs the Tilerow.

The information from these two figures can be summarized as following:

* For the Extended Barrel modules, as illustrated by figure 6.10, a significant difference between module responses is only seen in the muon signal. A difference smaller than 1% is seen in the Cs\({}^{137}\) results, except for the module EBC15 (tested in 2000) in Tilerows from 8 to 11. This is un expected results because Cs\({}^{137}\) data is the used to equalize the module response. From the comparison of the modules responses done with muon data and using module EBC24 as a reference, differences of about 4% and 2% for EBC38 and EBC15 are found respectively. Again as before, these differences are independent of the tile material used in the modules instrumentation.
* Similar to the results for the Extended Barrel modules, the difference in Barrel modules responses appears only in muon data. In this case, using module LB18C as a reference, the difference in response for LB18A is about 1% while for the modules tested in 2000 the differences are about 5%.

The black color is used for the Tilerows made of the BASF polystyrene tiles.

Each symbol represents a module. The black color is used for the Tilerows made of the BASF polystyrene tiles.

#### Differences in the Testbeam set-up

Muon data used for the analysis corresponds to runs in which the beam was incident at an angle \(\theta\) equal \(+90\) or \(-90\) degrees. In figure 6.12 the Testbeam set-up for the August 2001 is shown. The direction of the beam and the definition of the \(\theta\) angle are also given.

As mentioned earlier, the values of the muon responses are higher for the Extended Barrel module EBC38 and the Barrel half-module LB18A than the responses for the module (or half-module for the Barrel case) that had been placed next to them on the table. Both modules with the abnormally high muon response were tested in August 2001 Testbeam and were on the side of the beam entrance. Possible misalignment of the modules on the table could be the source of this effect. This hypothesis remains unchecked because no runs at 180 GeV with opposite beam incidence angle were taken during this Testbeam period.

There is no clear understanding why the Single Ratio value is not the same for all modules. The differences in the tile material used to instrument the modules is definitely ruled out as a possible source of the effect. The fact that the difference in the modules responses is only seen in the muon signal raises concern that the origin of this difference might be due to some uncontrolled parameters either in the Testbeam set-up or the electronics read-out. The differences in the module to module value of the single ratio has

Figure 6.12: August 2001 set-up.

a direct negative impact on the calibration quality and as a consequence on the future energy resolution of the calorimeter. More work needs to be done in this area using data from the 2002 Testbeams.

#### The truncated mean instead of the peak value as an estimator of the modules response to muons

An essential part of our study was to compare the modules response to Cesium source and to the muon beam. In order to make this comparison, the response to muons for each _TR-segment_ was characterized by the truncated mean value instead of the peak position of the energy distribution obtained from the fit procedure.

Several checks were done to see how good is the truncated mean value to describe the muon data when it is compared to the Cs\({}^{137}\) data. In the next table 6.3 the dispersion between the Single Ratio values for the _TR-segments_ is given, first, when the module response is characterized by the peak value, and second, when the truncated mean is used to describe the muon signal. An example of histograms of the two sets of RMS values, with the mean and the RMS of the RMS, is shown in figure 6.13

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|} \hline Module & RMS\% with peak & RMS\% with TM \\ \hline \hline EBC15(2000) & 2.8\(\pm\)0.3 & 2.7\(\pm\)0.3 \\ \hline EBA06 & 3.4\(\pm\)0.5 & 2.5\(\pm\)0.4 \\ \hline LB12A & 4.1\(\pm\)0.3 & 3.4\(\pm\)0.3 \\ \hline EBC38 & 2.2\(\pm\)0.2 & 2.5\(\pm\)0.3 \\ \hline EBA15 & 2.5\(\pm\)0.3 & 2.4\(\pm\)0.3 \\ \hline EBC15(2001) & 2.4\(\pm\)0.3 & 2.3\(\pm\)0.2 \\ \hline EBC24 & 2.8\(\pm\)0.3 & 2.3\(\pm\)0.2 \\ \hline LB18A & 3.8\(\pm\)0.3 & 2.9\(\pm\)0.2 \\ \hline LB18C & 3.4\(\pm\)0.3 & 3.0\(\pm\)0.2 \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 6.3: Single Ratio average for each module using peak or truncated mean value to characterize muon data.

The Single Ratio calculated using truncated mean has in general smaller dispersion between _TR-segments_. When the peak value is used the Single Ratio dispersion is about 11% higher. This proves that the truncated mean is a more accurate parameter to characterize the muon signal when it is compared to the Cs\({}^{137}\) response.

On the other hand, a study of the stability of the truncated mean value was done for some of the modules. As already said, the definition of the truncated mean is the mean of the distribution excluding the high energy tail. The minimum of the single ratio dispersion was used to optimize the cut. The study consists of calculating the value of the single ratio dispersion for different values of the cut parameter, i.e from zero to the 10 times the peak position. The dispersion of the Single Ratio values between _TR-segments_ in a module vs the position of the cut is shown in figure 6.14.

As illustrated by the figure, for the cut values higher than 3 times the peak value, the dispersion between _TR-segments_ becomes independent from the position of the cut.

Figure 6.13: Example of Single Ratio dispersion between _TR-segments_ in half barrel module. The plot on the left corresponds to muon data characterized by the peak value and the one characterized by truncated mean value on the right.

### 6.3 Propagation of the absolute energy scale

As already said, not all the modules will be exposed to the beam particles. For these modules a method to transfer the absolute energy scale (pC/GeV) using the Cs\({}^{137}\) source data has been used.

To study the accuracy of the absolute energy propagation procedure, an exercise using muon and Cs\({}^{137}\) data can be done. The procedure is to use the radioactive source data from two different modules (for instance A and B) and the muon response of one of these modules (for example B) to predict the expected muon signal for the second module (which would be A in our case), as the next expression shows:

\[modA^{muon}_{predicted}=\frac{modA^{Cs}}{modB^{Cs}}*modB^{muon}_{measured}\]

Now the expected muon signal for the module A can be compared to the muon signal of the same module measured at the Testbeam. In fact, the method can be applied to the sections of the modules, such as _TR-segments_. For each _TR-segment_, the ratio between the measured signal and the predicted one is calculated in order to compare them.

Figure 6.14: Single Ratio dispersion between _TR-segments_ for different values of the cut position. Data for the Extended Barrel module tested in the 2000 Testbeam is shown on the left. The plot on the right corresponds to the data from the half Barrel module tested in 2001.

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:107]

Alternatively if one selects module EBC24 as the reference one, not only the propagation of the calibration constants becomes unbiased, but also the accuracy of the propagation can be estimated to be as good as (1.4-2.2)%.

#### The Truncated mean

The results in the previous section indicate that using the truncated mean to estimate the muon response leads to a more stable Single Ratio. Therefore we proceed to study the dispersion of the ratio

\[Ratio=\frac{\mathrm{mod}A_{measured}^{muon}}{\mathrm{mod}A_{predicted}^{muon}}\]

using the truncated mean as our estimator. As before, we calculate the dispersion as a function of the different values of the cut and show the results in figure 6.15.

As before, for the cuts above 4 times the peak value, the definition of the truncated mean becomes extremely stable against statistical fluctuations in the distribution of the energy deposited by muons.

Figure 6.15: Dispersion between _TR-segment_ responses in ratio between the signal measured and the propagated one for different values of the cut position.

### 6.4 Conclusions

This chapter is devoted to investigating the discrepancies we observe in the correlation of Cs and muon signals.

When studying Double Ratio values within a module, it appears that the variation of the Double Ratio is greater for Extended Barrel modules than for Barrel modules. We think that for Extended Barrel cells a more accurate procedure to evaluate the Cs single tile response should be developed. This is because sharping up the procedure for the Barrel, which was triggered by our Double Ratio studies, did reduce the variation of the Barrel Double Ratio.

On the other hand, we have observed an unexpected difference in the Single Ratio of certain modules. We have ruled out that the tile base material is at the origin of this difference. However, we have not pinned down the reason for this differences that could negatively affect the resolution of the calorimeter.

A separate issue is that for certain cells all tile rows Single Ratio are systematically high or low. This systematic shift suggests an origin in the muon signal readout electronics, however cannot further substantiate this hypothesis. Also, it could be the explanation of the dispersion found between _TR-segments_ in the Single Ration variable, which is from 2.3 to 3.4%, in within a given module.

Finally, the study of the method to transfer the absolute scale using the Cs source data shows that the procedure might predict the muon response of another module with (1.4-2.2) % accuracy. However the unsolved problem presented before could add an error on the energy scale of 2-4 %.

## Chapter 7 Summary and Conclusions.

The ATLAS hadronic calorimeter calibration is based on a Cs source system and on Test Beam results. They are used not only to do the first inter-calibration of the different components of the calorimeter but also to obtain the initial EM scale for individual cells of TileCal.

The main goal of this work was to study and quantitatively compare Test Beam and source data taken on TileCal production modules in order to understand better the calorimeter calibration procedure.

All the studies were done with data taken during the 2000 and 2001 Test Beams, years in which the first production modules were exposed to the beam and the calibration program stated.

The uniformity of the module response was studied analyzing Cs and muon data. Here are the main conclusions from the Cs data:

1. The Cs source system, which is used to inter-calibrate the cell responses, provided module non-uniformity within _TR-segment_ sub-samples of 3%.
2. The analysis of the data taken during the two different Test Beams show that the procedure chosen to set the HV of the PMTs is crucial for the module uniformity because it can minimize the difference between the light budget for a given Tilerow, which is function of tiles size and the fibers length.

Muon impinging perpendicular to tile provided a check with real particles of the cell responses equalization. The conclusions are:1. A tight correlation between Cs and muon response is clearly observed.
2. The uniformity of muon response is worse than that of Cs response, because of the different energy deposition mechanism and uncontrollable parameters connected with the Testbeam set-up and the electronic read-out.

Altogether the dispersion between _TR-segments_ for a module using muon data is less than 4.5%, which is smaller than the rms non-uniformity required.

The truncated mean estimator was chosen to characterize the muon signal instead of the MOP parameter because it looked like more accurate for the comparison with Cs data. However, this estimator does not solve the problem related to the cell size dependence found in the muon signal, which is not in the Cs data by definition. An interesting continuation of this work would be to find another estimator to evaluate the muon data or a way to correct the signal, in order to eliminate it.

The last chapter is based in the direct comparison of the source and muon results and in the study of difference between modules. Some systematic shifts found for all modules in the last Tile Row of each sample should motivate a review of the procedure to evaluate the single tile response to Cs. Also, more studies should be done to extract the single tile response of the Extended Barrel.

The method to transfer the EM energy scale calibration of a module to other modules has been checked, and was shown to have an error of only about 2.2%. However we also observed differences in the response of modules to muons, that could add an error of 2-4% in this energy scale calibration. Currently we cannot ascribe these differences to a specific cause, however this line of work should be continued.
