**Abstract**

**We report on the measurements done in the Pisa INFN laboratory of scintillating tiles of the ATLAS hadronic Tile calorimeter. The attenuation length, the study of tile-to-tile differences, as well as the study of an assembled partial tower are discussed.**Introduction

The results of several measurements performed in Pisa of the ATLAS Tile calorimeter scintillating tiles are here described. The measured tiles are of the new type (flat lateral edge) and of the old one (having grooves at the edges).

The measurements include:

* the tile attenuation length;
* the light enhancement using two fibres coupled to the same tile side;
* the study of the tile-to-tile differences;
* the study of an assembled partial tower.

## 2 Tile attenuation length

The setup used for the attenuation length measurement is sketched in figure 1. A 76 cm long Bicron BCF91A WLS fibre is coupled to one side of the tile. The tile is excited using a Sr\({}^{90}\) source whose activity is 37 MBq and the fibre is readout at one end by a Hamamatsu R1635-02 photomultiplier. The source scan the tile along the central axis starting at \(-2\) cm from the tile edge up to 32 cm by 1 cm steps. At each step the photocurrent is measured using a digital multimeter read out through a GPIB-CAMAC interface by a OS-9 computer.

Only one side of the tile is read out and the other one is wrapped by a black tape to avoid light reflections. A typical attenuation curve is showed in figure 2. The curve shows the usual exponential attenuation:

\[f(x)=Ae^{x/\lambda_{att}}\]

The fit yields a \(l_{att}=42\pm 1\) cm. The result showed in figure 2 is for a tile number 9 wrapped with simple tyvek. The bump at the center of the tile is due to the production procedures and to the presence of the two holes in the tile: a higher amount of material is accumulated between the two holes.

In order to estimate the reflection due to the absence of any black tape or to the presence of a fibre coupled to the other tile side, measurements of the attenuation curve have been made in several conditions. It may be important to know what is the reflectivity in the case that a fibre is coupled to the other end of the tile but it cannot be read out (for example the fibre is broken).

The measurement follow the same procedure as above, but in this case the other side has not a black tape cover but is closed with an aluminized mylar strip with or without one of the three types of fibres that we have used (Bicron BCF91A, Kuraray Y11, Pol.Hi.Tech. S048). The resulting attenuation curves are fitted by the function:

\[f_{refl}(x)=\ Ae^{x/\int dt}\left(1+\ R\cdot\exp\ \frac{-2(L-x)}{l_{att}}\right)\]

where \(A\) and \(R\) are free parameters and \(l_{att}\) is the attenuation length measured above; \(L\) is the mean width of the tile. Figure 3 shows the resulting attenuation curves. The numerical values are reported in table 1. It has to be noted the higher reflectivity of the Pol.Hi.Tech. fibre. We are investigating the reasons of such a behaviour apparently not connected with the trapping efficiency of this fibre, being its light yield higher than the Bicron fibre [1].

## 3 Light enhancement using more than one readout fibre

The setup is the same as described above, but now we use more than one fibre at the tile edge. Pol.Hi.Tech. S048 fibres have been used. We can use up to three fibres since the tile thickness is 3 mm. Figure 4 shows the results of the scan with 1,2 or 3 fibres. The enhancement using two readout fibres is of 68 %, while using three fibres is of 168 %. The increase from two to three fibres is of 59 %.

Another interesting test is to use fibres of larger diameter. A tile with single side (0.835 mm Kuraray Y11 fibre was used), has been measured and a comparison made with the results obtained using a 1 mm Kuraray Y11 fibre.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|} \hline \multicolumn{2}{|c|}{**Reflection factor comparison**} \\ \hline \hline Configuration & \(R\) \\ \hline Air & 0.14 \(\pm\) 0.03 \\ \hline Aluminized mylar & 0.73 \(\pm\) 0.06 \\ \hline BCF91A (not read out) & 0.38 \(\pm\) 0.04 \\ \hline S048 (not read out) & 0.60 \(\pm\) 0.05 \\ \hline Y11 (not read out) & 0.38 \(\pm\) 0.04 \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 1: Reflection factor in the different experimental situations.

In this case the increase in fibre diameter is 20 % and the enhancement in light output is 29.3 % (fig. 5).

These data seems to indicate that is more effective for light collection to increase the diameter of a single fibre rather than to use a multi-fibre readout, i.e. a fibre with a diameter \(2D\) has a more efficient light collection than two fibres of diameter \(D\).

## 4 Effect of the Tedlar strips

During the past years a lot of improvement in the quality of the tiles has been made [2]. One of the problem remaining is the transverse nonuniformity of the tile light output (40 % of variation center-edge) due essentially to the production procedures. In order to have a better uniformity the original grooves have been removed and black Tedlar strips have been adopted to mask the region near the readout fibres. This technique has been used with success by CDF and ZEUS [3]. The same tile has been measured being wrapped using only Tyvek and then using two black Tedlar strips at the edges. The results are shown in figure 6. We can remark that the response is quite flat, even if at the expense of a reduction of 12 % of light yield.

## 5 Time of response of the system tile-fibre

The system tile-fibre should have a sufficient speed of response to minimize pile-up signals. The decay time of the system has been measured, as well as the time needed to collect the 90 % of the signal, using three different fibre types coupled to one of the new tiles, wrapped with Tyvek and masked with Tedlar strips.

Figure 7 shows the setup used. The discriminated signal of the photomultiplier 1 (Hamamatsu R1635-02) has been used to start a TDC (LeCroy 3001 qVt multichannel analyzer). This signal gives a quite precise time reference, because it is not associated to the light produced by the scintillator (accurately wrapped), but to the Cerenkov light produced by the \(\beta^{-}\) in the photomultiplier window glass (1 mm thick). The stop of the TDC is triggered by the discriminated signal of the photomultiplier 2. A filter having a transmission of 2 % assure the single photon condition. The time resolution of these measurements has been measured to be equal to 700 ps. The results obtained are summarized in table 2. The Y11 fibre is slower than the others but all are adequate for TILECAL.

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:5]

aim is the study of the light spread for each group. Since only 10 cm wide tiles were available it is impossible to reproduce exactly the real configuration. However the fibre length is the same as in the real configuration (fig. 12).

The fibre used are the Bicron BCF91A readout by a Hamamatsu R1635-02 photomultiplier. Each tower has been scanned using the Sr\({}^{90}\) source in different positions: on the axis of the tower and \(\pm 3\) cm from the axis. The results are presented in figures 13, 14, 15, and summarized in table 4.

The entry Fluctuation is defined as:

\[\text{Fluctuation }(\%)=\frac{\text{standard deviation}}{\text{Mean number of photoel}}\cdot 100\]

The same measurements have been done using Kuraray Y11 fibre with aluminized ends to evaluate if the spread is reduced. The results are reported in figures 16, 17, 18 and summarized in table 5.

The largest fluctuation at \(y=0\) for each group is clearly an artefact due to the presence of the holes on the scanning line.

A fluctuation of \(\sim 5\) % has been found for groups 1 and 2 and \(\sim 10\) % for group 3. These fluctuations are larger than the one due to tile-to-tile fluctuation (2 %) and the larger effect for group 3 is probably due to the short fibre length used.
