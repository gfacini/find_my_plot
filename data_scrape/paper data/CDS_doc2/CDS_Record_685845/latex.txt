## 1 Introduction

**At the luminosities foreseen for LHC (\(L\geq 2\cdot 10^{34}\)\(cm^{2}s^{-1}\)) the particle density due to multiple interactions makes tracking a very difficult task. In order to cope with the LHC conditions, tracking systems with a number of channels of the order of \(10^{6}\) - \(10^{7}\) are proposed. In order to keep the cost at an affordable level and to get the required performances in terms of pattern recognition and trigger capability an accurate optimization of the inner detector is needed,with the aim of reducing the number of channels while preserving the overall performances. The optimal subdivision of the tracking detector in cells in the \((\eta,\varphi)\) space, in order to achieve, with a given number of channels, the best rejection against random hit combination from low \(P_{T}\) tracks faking high \(P_{T}\) tracks, has been discussed in [1]. It has been argued there that in a solenoidal magnetic field it is best to have a fine subdivision in \(\varphi\) and a limited subdivision in \(\eta\), and that a multilayer approximately equispaced structure is more effective than superlayer structures made of closely spaced layers. Those design considerations apply to any detector, independently of the technique used. The Scintillating Fiber technique is considered here, since it can provide naturally the required geometry, i.e. fine \(\phi\) granularity and coarse \(\eta\) granularity, it is fast, it is simple, it is cheap. A Scintillating Fiber Hodoscope (SFH) is suggested to be used in the inner region to complement a precision tracker for an optimized design in terms of performances, complexity and costs. The detector is proposed for a threefold purpose:* to provide a level 1 tracking trigger,
* to increase the track pattern recognition capability with a limited number of channels,
* to provide the bunch crossing identification.

The inclusion of such a subdetector in the inner detector design improves the performances and at the same time reduces the costs, since it makes possible to release the requests on the other subdetectors of the tracking system in terms of number of layers, standalone performances and trigger performances.

The SFH can be realized with the present technology and does not require major technical developments.

The right framework to discuss the SFH performances would be within a design optimization process. This process has not yet started.

A number of aspects have been discussed in various presentations [1]. Here we summarize the results relative to the key issues. The purpose is that of providing information concerning this detector, that is useful to consider in the discussion of possible schemes of integration of different techniques in the design of the inner detector. The study of the combined performances of the integrated schemes of the detector remains to be done.

## 2 General Layout

The SFH consists of 8 cylinders positioned at approximatly equally spaced radii from \(R_{1}=60cm\) to \(R_{8}=112cm\) (fig.1).

This radial region is not totally filled up by the SFH, therefore it can be interleaved with other detectors.

The angular coverage is down to 45 degrees from a vertex displaced \(+20cm\) with respect to the beam interaction center and up to 135 degrees from a vertex displaced \(-20cm\) with respect to the same point (fig.2). The correspondent \(\eta\) coverage is about \(-1\leq\eta\leq 1\).

Each one of the 8 cylinders is made of a few layers of scintillating fibers (SciFi), of rectangular cross section, grouped in bundles so that they are subdivided in a fixed number of cells in \(\varphi\), the same for every cylinder. The number of cells considered is 3000. Therefore the total number of channels is \(8\cdot 3000=24000\).

## 3 Read Out Scheme

The read out is based on multianode PMTs. The light is collected at the scintillating fiber end by clear fibers, connected with a quick disconnect connector, and brought out to the PMTs placed outside of the central inner region.

## 4 Mechanical Design and Support Structure

The detector is shown inside the general layout in fig.3,where the path of the clear fibers taking out the light to the PMTs is indicated.

The cell structure of the detector is shown in fig.4.

Each cylinder is made of an internal carbon fiber cylinder, a few layers of Rohacell foam in which the SciFi are placed, and an external carbon fiber cylinder.

The layers of Rohacell are glued to the carbon fiber cylinders and between them. The SciFi are not glued. This avoids the contact of the glue on the fibers and the problems due to the different thermal dilatation coefficients of the carbon fiber and the SciFi.

The SciFi are not contiguous and can be displaced as it is needed in order to realize a variable size cell at different radii keeping fixed the width in \(\varphi\).

With such an arrangement the fiber cladding does not create any dead area. This allows the use of a thicker cladding.

The thickness of the carbon fiber cylinders is about \(0.25mm\). The active scintillating fiber thickness is about \(3mm\) for the first and the last cylinder, and about \(2mm\) for the internal ones.

The cylinders are hold by a carbon fiber support structure shown in fig.2.

## 5 Material Intercepted by the Particles

The thickness at 90 degrees is given by

* carbon fiber cylinders (\(4mm\)) = 1.6% r.l.
* SciFi (\(18mm\)) = 4.2% r.l.
* Rohacell (\(62mm\)) = 0.7% r.l.
* Total is 6.5% r.l.

The first layer thickness is

* carbon fiber cylinder (\(0.25mm\)) = 0.1% r.l.
* SciFi (\(3mm\)) = 0.7% r.l.
* Rohacell (\(8mm\)) = 0.09% r.l.

Total is 0.9% r.l.

The material thickness traversed by the particles grows with \(\eta\) as \(1/sin\theta\). There is a boundary region between \(\eta=1\) and \(\eta=1.1\). After that regionthe material is only given by clear fibers and the radial thickness is on the average at the level of 4-5% r.l. Notice however that this material will be very close to the external radius of the inner tracking region.

## 6 Services Needed

**No power or cooling are needed on the detector. The PMTs are located outside the inner region. Space for the clear fibers, which go onto the PMTs, is needed. The total cross section of the clear fibers is about \(1000cm^{2}\).**

## 7 Performances

**In this section the performances of the detector are discussed first in terms of the expected efficiency for minimum ionizing particles, then in terms of the response to various kind of pp events, i.e. pileup events, high-\(P_{T}\) jets, QCD jets passing the calorimeter selection without and with the addition of pileup events. The pattern recognition method is also discussed. The performances in terms of the impact of this detector on physics are not discussed here. The implications however are clear from a qualitative point of view and are potentially very interesting. At LHC leptons are the signature of the most interesting processes. This makes relevant for the event selection the tracking information, needed for lepton identification. The availability of the track determination at the first level trigger reduces the level 1 trigger rate and allows a lower calorimeter threshold for the electron trigger, increasing the efficiency for physics processes detected in the single electron channel. Also the muon trigger could benefit from the match with the tracking trigger in the inner region. A very interesting possibility opened up by the availability at level 1 of a tracking trigger is that of a \(\tau\) trigger.**

### Efficiency for Minimum Ionizing Particles

**Based on the assumption that the light yield extrapolated at zero distance is 7 photoelectrons/\(mm\), that the attenuation lenght in the SciFi is \(3m\) and in the clear fibers is \(9m\), and that the coefficient of transmission of the light at the SciFi-clear fiber connection is 0.90, the total number of photoelectrons for each one of the 8 detector layers is evaluated as a function of the angle \(\theta\) of the track and it is plotted in fig.5 for layer 1, 2, 7 and 8.**The track efficiency for a track identification based on the coincidence of all 8 layers, or on the coincidence of the first, the last, and 5 out of the 6 intermediate layers is plotted in fig.6.

### Pattern Recognition Algorithm

The pattern recognition is based on two dimensional roads in the \((R,\varphi)\) plane as it is sketched in fig.7.

A road is defined by the coincidence of

* a cell hit in the first layer
* a cell hit in the last layer
* the presence of a hit at each intermediate layer in at least one of the two adjacent cells crossed by the straight lines connecting the end points of the cell in the last layer to the end points of the cell in the first layer.

The results shown in the following are based on this algorithm.

### Single Track Efficiency

The curve of the efficiency vs \(P_{T}\) for various \(P_{T}\) thresholds is plotted in fig.8.

The threshold is set by accepting only the roads with the innermost layer cell displaced in \(\varphi\) with respect to the outer layer cell within a given limit. In fig.8 the curves are shown indicating the number of accepted roads for \(\delta I_{road}\leq 0,\pm 1,\pm 2,\pm 3,\pm 4\) where \(\delta I_{road}=\delta\varphi/(\text{cell width})\).

This efficiency represents the single track efficiency and indicates the resolution of the system.

The track finding efficiency with a pileup of 20 interactions, on average, superimposed to a single electron, has been obtained from the analysis of 500 events made of an electron with \(P_{T}=30GeV/c\) plus the described pileup.

The results obtained are the following:

for \(\delta I_{road}\leq 3\)(i.e. \(P_{T}\geq 25Gev/c\)) the efficiency is 97.6%

for \(\delta I_{road}\leq 4\)(i.e. \(P_{T}\geq 20Gev/c\)) the efficiency is 98.2%

### Performances on pp Events

A series of simulation studies have been done with the detector configuration discussed above.

The \(\eta\) coverage is about \(-1\leq\eta\leq 1\). The number of cells per layer is \(N_{cell}=3000\).

In fig.9, the cell occupancy is shown as a function of the radius of the layer,for a LHC luminosity L=2\(\cdot 10^{34}cm^{2}s^{-1}\), that was assumed to correspond to 20 average pp inelastic interactions per bunch crossing. The unbiased inelastic interactions are simulated by mixing ISAJET min.bias events and two-jet events with \(P_{T}\geq 6\)GeV/c at a probability ratio 2:1. The events are simulated through the detector with GEANT. The occupancy is defined as the probability that a cell is hit in a given bunch crossing. This corresponds to assuming a "sensitive" time equal to the interbunch separation. Improvements can be obtained if the "sensitive" time can be divided in subintervals of the interbunch separation. No energy threshold has been required for the particles to give a hit in the detector,therefore the results obtained from the simulation are a conservative approximation. The rate at which the random occupancy can give fake tracks depend upon the level of the coincidence required. This method is effective in presence of a magnetic field, when high \(P_{T}\) tracks have to be identified on a background due to low \(P_{T}\) tracks. For pileup events with on average 20 interactions per bunch crossing the probability of a fake track everywhere in the detector belonging to roads corresponding to a \(P_{T}\) value above 20 GeV/c is found to be about 1.6% per event. The background rejection has been studied analysing a sample of 500 QCD jet events passing the calorimeter electron selection [2], with a superimposed pileup of 20 interactions per event on average. The events are selected by requiring:

\begin{tabular}{l l l}
**Eem\(\geq\) 20GeV/c** & in & \(\delta\eta\cdot\delta\varphi=0.06\cdot 0.06\) \\
**Eleak\(\leq\) 5GeV/c** & in & \(\delta\eta\cdot\delta\varphi=0.06\cdot 0.06\) \\
**Eisol\(\leq\) 10GeV/c** & in & \(\delta\eta\cdot\delta\varphi=0.1\cdot 0.1\) \\ \end{tabular}

**From the simulation through the detector of those 500 events, we get, before any \(\varphi\) correlation with the clusters in the calorimeter is required,**

* 27 events with a real track with \(P_{T}\geq\) 20 GeV/c (25 electrons and 2 muons)
* 10 events (i.e. 2%) with fake tracks with \(P_{T}\geq\) 20 GeV/c**

**After the \(\varphi\) correlation with the clusters in the calorimeter has been required the number of events with a fake trigger _goes to 0_.**

## 8 Radiation Tolerance

**The detector must withstand the radiation level in the inner region without suffering a significant degradation for many years. At the LHC luminosity L=2 \(\cdot 10^{34}cm^{2}s^{-1}\), the dose rate per year due to the charged particle flux from pp interactions ranges from 40 Krad to 160 Krad at radii from \(1m\) to \(0.5m\). The detector must therefore tolerate up to a few Mrad dose. Recent work [3] seems to indicate that SciFi can indeed achieve such performances, especially for wavelenght in the green region, for which also green-extended photocathodes have been developed. However the process of radiation damage and recovery is a complex one and it depends on the conditions of radiation exposure and recovery. Therefore the radiation tolerance of the system has to be studied under realistic conditions with a prototype. In addition to the charged particle flux, there is also a neutron flux in the inner cavity enclosed by the calorimeter that is estimated to be of the order of \(2\cdot 10^{13}cm^{2}y^{-1}\)[4]. This has to be compared whith the flux of the charged particles, ranging from \(1.2\cdot 10^{12}cm^{2}y^{-1}\) to \(4.8\cdot 10^{12}cm^{2}y^{-1}\) at radii between \(0.5m\) and \(1m\). The contribution of the interacting neutrons to the dose and the number of hits in the scintillating fibers should be carefully studied. However there is an indication that the damage produced by neutrons in fibers is not larger than the damage due to photons at the same dose [3].

## 9 R&D Milestones

**The project described above can be realized with the existing technology and does not rely on major developments to be achieved. The feasibility of the system and the level of the performances achievable has, however, to be proven with dedicated tests of single components as well as with the construction and test of a prototype. The major issues are :**

* **light yield and attenuation lenght of the SciFi**
* **effect of the radiation on the SciFi**
* **light transmission at the SciFi-clear fiber connection**
* **mulianode PMT performances.**

**The first milestones of the R&D work consist in the experimental study devoted to collect accurate and systematic informations on each of the topics, in realistic conditions. The results of the study can have a major impact on the detector design. Another important milestone is the realization and test of a suitable trigger processor. Tests of the mechanical structure and the construction procedure must also be performed. Finally the construction and test of a prototype will conclude the R&D work.**This R&D activity has already started in the Frascati laboratory, in collaboration or in close contact with the relevant industries in the field.

## 10 Cost

The major component of the cost is represented by the PMTs.

We can estimate the cost of a system based on the use of the 256 channels PMT Hamamatsu H4140. The pixel size is \(2.34\cdot 2.34\ mm^{2}\) with a \(2.54mm\) pitch.

At the moment we evaluate that a number of PMTs of about 120 is required in order to read out one side of the detector. For such a quantity the price of the Hamamatsu H4140 is about 12KSFr (that is half the current price for the purchase of one PMT). Therefore the total cost of the PMTs is about 1.5 MSFr.

The cost of the mechanics is estimated to be about 300 KSFr (rough indication by ITALCOMPOSITI).

The scintillating fiber lenght needed is about 200 Km, which correspond to about 100 KSFr (0.5 KSFr/_Km_).

The clear fiber lenght needed is about 800 Km, which correspond to about 400 KSFr (0.5 KSFr/_Km_).

The electronics cost is expected to be about 500 KSFr (20 SFr x 24 Kchannels).

The trigger processor cost is estimated to be about 400 KSFr (rough indication by CAEN ).

In conclusion a first estimate of the cost of the Scintillating Fiber Hodoscope described above is 3.2 MSFr.
