**Abstract**

We report on further studies of normal WLS fibres and WLS fibres spliced with a clear fibre. An evaluation of the light enhancement due to the aluminization or to a real mirror positioned at one end of the fibre is done.

Introduction

In our previous notes [1, 2] we reported on the WLS fibre measurement methods and on the results achieved. Good quality Pol.Hi.Tech. fibres have been produced in terms of light yield, attenuation length and reproducibility of these characteristics. After this basic study our aim has been to go more deeply in the investigation of the other aspects of the use of WLS fibres in TILECAL.

To complete the study and the results obtained in the previous note, we evaluated the reflectivity of the aluminization at one end of the fibres.

A small R&D program was also carried out to test the use of WLS fibres spliced to clear fibres as proposed by the Michigan State University (MSU) group. Several fibres have been tested, with different length of clear fibres. The attenuation curve showed an unwanted component at small distance between the photodetector and the light production point. In order to have a correct estimation of all the effects and problems of this technique, we measured with two different methods the attenuation length of the clear fibres. A tentative model for the light propagation in this type of fibres is reported. We also estimated the effects of the spread of the length of WLS fibres on the TILECAL resolution to understand the advantages and disadvantages of the standard fibres in comparison with the spliced ones.

## 2 Reflectivity of fibre aluminized ends

The WLS fibres in TILECAL will be aluminized at one end to enhance the light collection. In [1] it is reported the effect of the aluminization and of the use of a "real" mirror at one end of a fibre. The plots showed that the aluminization reflectivity was roughly double than in the case of the "real" mirror.

A correct evaluation of the reflectivity may help us to estimate the maximum light yield of a fibre. The light attenuation of an aluminized fibre was measured, as well as that once removed the last aluminized tip and replaced with a real mirror. Finally we measured the light attenuation of the fibre with the far end blackened (figure 1). The effect of the reflection at the far end is then evaluated with a simple model in which the reflectivity \(R\) is a free parameter in the function:

\[f_{AL}(x)=f(x)+Rf(2L-x)\]

where \(L\) is the fibre length and \(f(x)\) the light attenuation curve when the aluminized end of the fibre is removed:\[f(\textbf{{x}})=N_{1}\exp-\frac{\textbf{{x}}}{\lambda_{1}}+N_{2}\exp-\frac{\textbf{{ x}}}{\lambda_{2}}\]

We found for the aluminized fibres Kuraray Y11 and Bicron BCF91A (taken at CERN) a reflectivity \(R\) equal to 60 %. Instead using a real mirror we obtained \(R=30\) %. For the Y11 fibres spliced with a clear fibre and aluminized at Fermilab we have \(R=65\) %. The aluminization technique used at Fermilab is sligthly different [3]. In figure 1 we report an example of our evaluation.

## 3 The spliced fibres

In order to reduce the fibre to fibre response disuniformity due to different fibre length in TILECAL the MSU group proposed to use short WLS fibre

connected with long clear fibres to transport the signal to the photomultipliers. This technique has already been adopted for the hadronic calorimeter of the CDF experiment at Fermilab [3].

Our colleagues working in the CDF Pisa group and the MSU people provided us with some samples of such fibres for testing.

The stress resistance at the junction of these fibres is very good. The measurement of these fibres was done with the same methods used for the normal fibres. A scintillator is coupled with WLS section and excited by a Sr\({}^{90}\) source. A scanning of the fibre provide the attenuation curve as described in [1].

The attenuation curves (fig. 2) show the presence of two components of light, having \(\sim 20\) cm and \(\sim 300\) cm of attenuation length respectively. This strange behaviour suggests that there is still the presence of a cladding light, while we could have expected that the cladding light would have been completely removed by the long clear fibre. The explanation of our collaborators of MSU is that there is a cladding type of component to the light with a

short attenuation length in the green fibre but a longer one in the clear fibre.

This light component introduces a disuniformity of the same type of the WLS fibre itself. We attempted a model of the light propagation in the spliced fibres to estimate the light components. In figure 3 we sketch the section of a fibre around the junction, the critical region. When a particle crosses a normal WLS fibre, at a distance less than 50 cm from the photodetector, two components contribute to the light, one arising from the normal trapping of the light in the core, the second one arising from light not trapped in the core, but with an appropriate angle to be trapped at the interface cladding-air. The cladding light tipically has a short attenuation length and for distance less than 50 cm introduces an enhancement in the light output, yielding a disuniformity. In the case of the spliced fibres, such a component, following our model, is focussed by a sort of lensing effect at the junction and trapped as core light in the clear fibre. In this way one of the advantages expected for the spliced fibres, i.e. the light yield independent of the clear fibre length, is partially lost.

An important quantity to be measured is also the clear fibre attenuation length. To measure this quantity we used one of WLS fibres spliced to a clear fibre in a destructive way. Fixed the source position exciting the scintillator coupled to a fixed position of the WLS fibre, we measure the photocurrent at the end of the clear fibre, shortening it in steps of 1 cm up to the junction. In such a way we have a photocurrent attenuation curve fitted by single exponential from which we extract the clear fibre attenuation length. An attenuation length \(l_{att}=15\) m has been measured (see fig. 5).

At this point, taken in account also the high cost of the splicing technique, an evaluation of the spread for the light function \(L(x)\), introduced by the different length in WLS fibres has been tried.

### Evaluation of the spread

Figure 4 shows the attenuation curves for the same fibre first spliced with a clear fibre (28 cm long) and then after having cut the clear fibre. It is clear the higher light yield of the spliced fibres for the first points. Unfortunately we had not the possibility to test and compare longer fibres. However one can compute what would have been the results of a 1 m long WLS fibre and a 28 cm WLS spliced with 1 m clear fibre. The 1 m long WLS fibre light would have been attenuated according to the known exponential low (\(\lambda_{att}\simeq 300\) cm) while the effect of the long clear fibre is negligible (\(\lambda_{att}\simeq 15\) m). The net result is that the light yield of a spliced fibre is \(\sim 15\) % higher than the attenuated WLS light. An important quantity that enters in the resolution of the calorimeter (costant term) is the variance of the distribution of the light function \(\mathcal{L}(x)\) due to the spread of real WLS fibre length in TILECAL.

Let us assume that the maximum difference in fibre-to-fibre length is \(\Delta x=x_{2}-x_{1}=1\) m and that the attenuation length of the fibre is \(l_{att}=3\) m. The light function expression is:

\[\mathcal{L}(x)=\,\mathcal{L}_{0}\,\mathrm{exp}(-x/l_{att})\]

and the variance of \(\mathcal{L}(x)\) is:

\[\sigma^{2}=\,E[(\mathcal{L}-\bar{\mathcal{L}})^{2}]=\bar{\mathcal{L}}^{2}- \bar{\mathcal{L}}^{2}\]

After some algebra it is easy to find a simple approximate expression for \(\sigma\) (for small \(\Delta x/l_{att}\)):

\[\sigma\simeq\frac{{\cal L}_{0}}{\sqrt{12}}e^{-x_{1}/l_{att}}\Big{(}\frac{\Delta x }{l_{att}}\Big{)}\]

using \(\Delta x=1\) m, \(x_{1}=1\) m and \(l_{att}=3\) m:

\[\frac{\sigma}{{\cal L}_{0}}\simeq 6\ \%\]

The effective spread relative to the light reaching the photomultiplier is obtained by dividing the previous expression by the attenuation factor, then:

\[\frac{\sigma}{{\cal L}_{0}\exp(-x_{1}/l_{att})}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{12}}\Big{(}\frac {\Delta x}{l_{att}}\Big{)}\simeq 10\ \%\]

To compute the effect of this disuniformity on the calorimeter resolution, we have to weight the fibre length spread by the longitudinal fluctuations of the hadronic shower. Preliminary MonteCarlo calculations indicate that this spread does not to affect the calorimeter resolution in an important way. It is worth to have a more complete study with a careful MonteCarlo simulation.
