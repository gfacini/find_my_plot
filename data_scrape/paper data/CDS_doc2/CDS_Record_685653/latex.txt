**Study of neutron and \(\gamma\) backgrounds in ATLAS**

**Abstract**

The radiation environment in the ATLAS detector has been evaluated using DTUJET for the primary pp-collision at 7\(\times\)7 TeV, GEANT for the geometry and material descriptions (SLUG) as well as simulation of hadronic and electromagnetic cascades, and GCALOR for low energy neutron transport. An attempt has been made to present a coherent approach to identification and quantification all of the relevant sources of uncorrelated background for detector elements and potential radiation damage.

A preliminary estimate of neutron and \(\gamma\) fluxes is presented. It has been compared with calculations based on the FLUKA code. In general, results obtained with GCALOR are a factor of 2 higher than the FLUKA estimates, but for the very forward endcap chambers the \(\gamma\) flux is a factor of 10 higher than those using FLUKA.

Several different shielding concepts have been considered. The best results have been obtained with the GEM neutron elimination concept, which includes the forward calorimeter placed just behind the endcap calorimeter and isolating the collimators, low beta quadrupoles, and forward calorimeters with heavy concrete shielding. In this concept it is possible to reduce the neutron and \(\gamma\) backgrounds for the barrel chambers (neutron flux \(\sim\) 5 kHz cm\({}^{-2}\)) and the external muon endcap chambers (\(\sim\) 10 kHz cm\({}^{-2}\)) to an acceptable level. In the inner muon endcap chambers the neutron flux is 100 kHz cm\({}^{-2}\). Further reduction of this flux requires increasing the thickness of the endcap calorimeter.
