Introduction

The application of silicon strip detectors in the environment of LHC conditions poses extreme demands with respect to radiation hardness and reliability. Simultaneously - due to the large areas to be covered - an economic solution for producing the detectors has to be found.

Although considerable knowledge has been obtained on the effects of the LHC radiation environment on detectors - especially by the systematic basic studies on radiation damage in silicon within the RD2 collaboration - no completely developed and tested strip detector design exists so far. Furthermore there remain open basic questions on radiation damage mechanisms which's study and eventual understanding could later on be used for improving the radiation hardness of our devices.

We are of the opinion that the challenge of developing detectors satisfying the LHC demands requires a thorough understanding of all aspects involved in detector design and operation. This includes knowledge of the starting material properties, device processing technology, detailed layout and functioning of detector and protection structures. This is especially important as the properties of silicon and insulating material (\(SiO_{2}\)) will change with irradiation and function tests before installation do not guarantee satisfactory performance over the lifetime of the experiment.

Information on all details of technology will only be freely available in the environment of an institute, not however from industry. The Max-Planck-Institute in Munich has set up a semiconductor laboratory which is equipped with state of the art silicon detector processing technology as well as design, simulation and test facilities. These facilities are used for the development of sophisticated detectors for X-ray astronomy, spectroscopy and high energy physics. Experties on all aspects of silicon detectors exists within the staff of the laboratory.

Considering this situation it seems natural that the main effort of strip detector development for ATLAS should be done using the capabilities of this laboratory, such assuring that a coherent and optimized design develops which then can be transferred to industry.

In the following we present our opinion on an optimal detector concept based on the present knowledge, describe the work done up to now and propose further steps towards optimization of detector design and technology development.

## 2 Requirements for ATLAS strip detectors

### Radiation hardness

The outstanding challenge for LHC inner tracker detectors is the required hardness with respect to neutron and charged particle damage. Extensive studies on the expected radiation environment in the ATLAS experiment and on the effect of irradiation on silicon properties have been made.

We will not attempt to present the results but will only make a few rough remarks:

The total neutron flux expected for 10 years LHC operation is roughly \(10^{14}\)_m/cm\({}^{2}\)_indepen- dent of position. The charged hadron flux is proportional \(1/r^{2}\) (r being the distance from the beam) independent of z. At \(r\approx 30cm\) the charged hadron flux is equal to the neutron flux. The damage to the silicon bulk of neutrons and charged hadrons is roughly equal. Charged particles do much larger damage to \(SiO_{2}\) than neutrons.

Neutrons and charged hadrons generate crystal defects which may act as recombination/generation centers, as trapping centers or as effective dopants.

Their effect on silicon properties which are relevant for detector applications are the following:

1. Decrease of the generation lifetime which results in an increase of the reverse bias current of the detector.
2. Change in the effective doping concentration (for n-type material exponential decrease with dose of doping concentration followed by type inversion and subsequent linear increase of p-doping) due to: 1. effective removal of n-doping due to the generation of phosphor-vacancy or other complexes as e.g. Carbon-Phosphot 2. generation of effective p-doping centers. The creation of at least part of these centers occurs with very long time delay (months or years). This effect which's exact mechanism is not yet explained is known as reverse annealing. It can be slowed down by cooling 1.

Footnote 1: An alternative method for suppressing reverse annealing based on a yet experimentally unconfirmed model has been proposed in reference[3]

Superimposed on these effects is annealing, respectively the transformation of instable defects into stable defects, such changing the electrical properties of the material. Annealing, respectively the transformation of defects occurs already at room temperature. Time constants are strongly dependant on the temperature.

The dominating effect on \(SiO_{2}\) which is used as insulation, respectively passivation material is an increase of the positive oxide charge. It is mainly due to the generation of electron-hole pairs by ionizing radiation, part of the holes being permanently trapped in deep lying trapping centers in the oxide and the oxide - silicon interface. The size of the effect is dependent on oxide quality and operation condition during irradiation.

### Stability and reliability

Stable operation has to be guarantied also after changing of material properties due to irradiation. This may be accomplished by proper design including guard structures which avoid high electric field brakdown due to radiation induced doping changes and oxide charge buildup. In addition the radiation effects should be minimized by choosing optimum silicon material and technology.

An additional requirement is fault tolerance. Local faults in detectors occuring either in production or during operation should disable only proper working of at most one or few strips but otherwise keep the system fully operational.

### Coupling to readout electronics

The burden of absorbing the high reverse bias currents can be shifted either to the detector or to the electronics. The complication and noise degradation of electronics able to absorb the large radiation induced currents compared to a simple charge sensitive amplifier still has to be determined. It is believed however that the noise performance of a charge sensitive amplifier capacitively coupled to the detector could be superior. On the other hand integration of capacitive coupling into the detector is believed to be expensive. This is however true to a much smaller extent for the detector concept presently developed in Munich.

### One and / or double sided readout

The choice one or both solution is still open. Therefore both options should still be pursued and a choice should be made when enough information including the question on price is available on both options.

## 3 Detector concepts

The presently preferred detector concepts are one and/or double sided capacitively coupled strip detectors using capacitive charge division so as to minimize the burden on electronics and to reach maximum resolution when using analog readout. The concept is based on punch through biasing which allows production of detectors with only slight complications compared to directly coupled detectors. In addition protection structures are implemented which should prevent electrical breakdown by enforcing a controlled drop of the detector bias voltage from the active region towards the edges of the wafer. Protection structures are extremely important, especially in view of the not completely understood changes of material bulk and surface properties under extreme radiation exposure. In the following the concept will be described in detail and compared to standard directly coupled detectors.

### Standard single sided directly coupled strip detectors

These most simple strip detectors are usually produced on \(<1,1,1>\) high ohmic n-type silicon. A cross section through such a detector is shown in Fig.1. Implanted p-strips are directly coupled to the strip like aluminum electrodes. The backside is heavily n-doped and covered with aluminum. Production of such a detector requires

* 2 photolithographic steps: oxide opening and aluminum patterning
* 2 implantations: \(p^{+}\) strip and \(n^{+}\) backside

Figure 1: Standard strip detector (a) before and (b) after type inversion

The expected operation conditions of such a detector before and after type inversion are as follows:

* operation before type inversion (Fig. 1a). On application of detector bias the space charge region grows from the p-strip side into the bulk. Potential high-field respectively breakdown regions are at the edges of the strip region where the bias voltage may drop over a very short distance to bulk potential. The breakdown condition depends very strongly on the oxide charge and the surface properties of the silicon oxide.
* operation after type inversion (Fig. 1b). The space charge region grows from the large area diode on the backside. As long as it does not reach the strip side the device does not work as a position sensitive detector. A potentially large danger lies in the fact that the space charge region extends all the way towards the cutting edge of the detector where large damage of silicon is present, so that one would expect large currents or complete breakdown of the device. There exists however experimental evidence that type inversion may be suppressed near the surface [1, 2]. This effect may be responsible for the observed survival of detectors after type inversion by the the RD20 and RD2 collaborations. Another effect to be considered in this context is the growth of a thin native oxide layer on the cutting edge and the possible presence of an electron accumulation layer underneath.

### Double sided directly coupled strip detectors

A cross section through a double sided directly coupled strip detector is shown in Fig.2. Making n-strips on n-type or also p-type material leads to an insulation problem. An electron accumulation or inversion layer caused by the oxide charge shorts the strips with each other.

Insulation of strips can be obtained by p- implantation in between n-strips. Production of such a detector requires

* 5 photolithographic steps: oxide opening for p-strips on p-side, oxide opening for n-strips on n-side, p- insulation structures on n-side, aluminum patterning on n- and at p-side
* 3 implantations: \(p^{+}\) strip on p-side, \(n^{+}\) strips on n-side and p-insulation on n-side.

Figure 2: Cross section of a double sided strip detector with p-strip insulation at n-side. The cut direction is assumed to be inclined with respect to both strip directions.

### Capacitively coupled strip detectors

Capacitively coupled strip detectors have the advantage with respect to directly coupled detectors of protecting the electronics from the reverse bias current, thus providing an automatic correction for pedestal variation and simplifying the requirements on the electronics. A capacitor and a resistor have to be integrated with each strip. The use of polysilicon resistors for biasing [5] has lead to a rather complicated device structure which roughly doubled the amount of technology steps compared to direct coupling.

Considerable simplification could again be reached with the introduction of a new biasing principle [6] which is now commonly referred as punch through, reach through or forxfet biasing. Technology remains almost as simple as directly coupled detectors and breakdown protection structures [7] can easily be added.

In view of the complicated technology with polisilicon resistor biasing which leads to high production cost with no apparent advantage in performance a description of this technology will be omitted. In the following single and double sided detectors with the simplified biasing scheme will be described.

The single sided detector in Fig.3 uses p-strips on n-type material. A bias ring surrounds the active detector region. The protection structures provide controlled drop of potential before type inversion [7]. After type inversion the problematic edge behavior remains as with simple single sided detectors described above.

Production of such a detector requires

* 3 photolithographic steps: oxide opening for contact holes on p-side, photoresist patterning for strip implantation, aluminum patterning on p-side
* 2 implantations: \(p^{+}\) strip on p-side and \(n^{+}\) large area on n-side.

Compared to directly coupled detectors only one simple structure photolithographic step has to be added.

A double sided detector on n-material is shown in Fig.4. Here the electron accumulation layer is (over)compensated at the n-side by a large area p-implantation. Protection structures on p- and n-side provide a controlled drop of the bias voltage at the rim of the detector both before and after type inversion.

Production of such a detector requires

Figure 3: Single sided p-strip detector with punch through biasing and p-side breakdown protection structures. A cut perpendicular to the wafer along the strip direction is shown.

* 6 photolithographic steps: oxide opening for contact holes on p- and n-side, photoresist patterning for strip implantation on p- and n-side, aluminum patterning on p- and n-side
* 3 implantations: large area p-compensation implantation on n-side, p+ strip on p-side and \(n^{+}\) strip on n-side.

Compared to standard double sided directly coupled strip detectors we have only added one simple structure photolithographic step.

### Preferred detector concept

Considering the modest complication in detector production of capacitively coupled detectors compared to directly coupled ones and the decreased demands on electronics we advocate capacitive coupling for single and double sided detectors.

Production on p-type wafers allows simplification of the detector concept as protection against type inversion is superfluous.

The mechanism of type inversion still requires investigations, especially the suspicion that type inversion does not occur as easily near the surface as inside the bulk [1, 4]. Such an effect must be responsible for the survival of standard detectors after type inversion 2.

Footnote 2: A natural explanation for non-inversion of the surface is provided by the model in reference [3]

In the following out presently prefered single and double sided strip detector concepts are presented. They are built on p-type silicon wafers such as to avoid complications with inversion. The p-side bias can be applied through a forward biased diode on the n-side. Protection structures on the n-side ensure a gradual drop of the bias voltage from the detector region towards the rim of the detector. Oxide charge at the n-side is (over)compensated by a large area p-implant. Strips are implanted through the oxide. Compared to field induced strips [8] the technology is slightly more complicated. It has been chosen because of its superiority in fault tolerance and because of the possibility of using capacitive charge division readout.

Production of the single sided detector shown in Fig.5 requires

* 3 photolithographic steps: oxide opening for contact holes on n-side, photoresist patterning for strip implantation on n-side, aluminum patterning on n-side

Figure 4: Double sided capacitively coupled strip detector with large area compensation implantation at n-side. Here the cut is along the strip direction on both sides of the wafer for reasons of simpler presentation of the working principle.

* 3 implantations: large area p-compensation implantation on n-side, \(p^{+}\) on p-side and \(n^{+}\) strip on n-side.

Compared to standard single sided directly coupled strip detectors we have only added one simple structure photolithographic step and one large area implantation.

Production of the double sided detector shown in Fig.6 requires

* 5 photolithographic steps: oxide opening for contact holes on n-side, photoresist patterning for strip implantation on n- and p-side, aluminum patterning on n- and p-side
* 3 implantations: large area p-compensation implantation on n-side, large area \(p^{+}\) on p-side and n+ strip on n-side.

Compared to standard double sided directly coupled strip detectors we have added no processing step.

Improvement of detector technology

Although the proposal is based on largely proven concepts and technology there is still room for improvement which may lead to lower production cost and/or better performance respectively radiation hardness. In the following some of these points are discussed.

### Choice of crystal orientation

The standard material is high ohmic n-type \(<1,1,1>\) silicon. It historically was chosen for reasons of availability due to its use in thyristor production. It has the advantage over \(<1,0,0>\) orientation of suppressing the growth of aluminum spikes into silicon during the sintering process. Its disadvantage is the much higher oxide charge density. An open question is the comparison of oxide charge buildup of the two orientations by irradiation. If it turns out that \(<1,0,0>\) is also significantly better in this respect one should change to this type of material.

### p-type material

As pointed out in chapter 3 our presently preferred options for single and double sided detectors are built on p-type material in order to avoid complications with type inversion. We want to point out that use of n-type material is not expected to compensate part of the buildup of effective p-doping due to irradiation as the processes of n-doping compensation and p-doping buildup are believed to occur independently. The final doping concentration is therefore expected to depend on the original p-doping only. (n-type silicon contains always p-doping which is overcompensated by n-doping).

### Alternative methods for the production of contact holes

An in principle simple but delicate photolithographic step is the opening of contact holes. Here almost the full wafer is covered with photoresist and only a few holes have to be etched through the oxide. Small defects in the resist may lead to unwanted holes in the oxide thus shortening a few strip capacitors.

A method for selective oxide opening by e.g. a focussed ion beam, laser cutting of holes or photochemical etching would avoid this problem and in addition reduce the number of photolithographic steps by one. At present photochemical etching seem the most promising approach.

## 5 Radiation hardening of silicon and SiO2

Systematic radiation damage studies especially by the Hamburg University group within the RD2 collaboration have lead to a fairly good description of the silicon bulk damage and annealing effects including their temperature behavior. Thus a recommandation for operation conditions (cooling to somewhat above \(0^{\circ}C\) during operation and a large fraction of the off-time) has been given. Cooling during operation reduces the dark current, cooling in the off-time slows down reverse annealing.

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:11]

Measurements of these detectors are presently under way. These measurements involve the properties of bias mechanisms and breakdown protection structures, leakage currents and capacitances on p- and n-sides. Measurements are compared with results of device modelling and excellent agreement between measurement and prediction has been observed.
2. Design and production of p-type single sided capacitively coupled strip detectors. Detector design and simulations are finished. Preparation of processing equipment and optimization of some technological steps are required. Production will start in June 1994.
3. Design and production of p-type double sided capacitively coupled strip detectors. Detector design and simulations are done. Production will start in summer 1994. The estimated production time is two months.

### Technology development

Besides the normal optimization of process parameters (which will be done in parallel with prototype production) there remains the systematic studies of the dependence of material properties of silicon and \(SiO_{2}\) and the \(Si-SiO_{2}\) interface on processing parameters as e.g. oxidation temperature, defect gettering and other conditions. Studies of this kind are underway at present, but manpower somewhat short to expect very rapid progress.

An additional aim of technology development is simplification and defect minimization of processing. The main candidate for this simplification is oxide etching by alternative methods. Process development has started already. First results are expected by summer 1994.

### Radiation hardening

Radiation damage tests will be done in parallel with detector prototype fabrication. Their results will have strong impact on the layout of detectors and on the detector technology development programme. The following activities are forseen:

1. Test of detector prototypes. Pion damage studies of test structures and small size n-type double sided detectors will be done at the PSI in summer 1994. Neutron damage tests of n-type double and single sided capacitively coupled detectors as well as of single sided p-type detectors are foreseen in Braunschweig in the fall of 1994.
2. Radiation bulk damage studies. These studies will be performed on small area test structures, mainly diodes or diodes with protection structures in order to understand the basic mechanisms of radiation damage and in order to find the dependence on the starting material properties as well as the processing technology. Cooperation with the supplier of silicon as well as with institutes specialized in analysing crystal defects is necessary.
3. Oxide radiation damage studies These studies will be performed on small area test structures, mainly capacitors with protection structures in order to understand the basic mechanisms of oxide radiation damage and in order to find the dependence on the processing parameters and the starting material as e.g. crystal orientation, oxidation temperature, biasing during exposure etc.

## 7 Manpower and time table

As seen from the author list there are 13 people involved in the project at present, the majority not full time. Nevetheless this number is a good basis, considering the expectation that a few more physicists and students will join the project. It also has to be seen that many more persons are working in the semiconductor laboratory. Although these people work on different projects, problems and projects to a large extent overlap. We therefore do not see a severe shortage of manpower in design and processing but more in activities connected with testing and analyzing the test data. Semiconductor design and simulation capabilities are at present set up in addition to the semiconductor laboratory also at Dortmund and further testing equipment is being installed at several places.

It is expected that the emphasis of activities will be distributed as follows:

1. Munich:

- detector design

- detector production

- technology development

- testing

- Dortmund:

- detector simulation

- detector testing

- radiation damage tests

- Hamburg:

- radiation damage tests

- radiation defect analysis

The initial development period in which we expect to develop detectors sufficiently mature to be tranferred to industry will last for three years. At present we do not consider it reasonable to make longer range plans.

## 8 Cost estimate

The preliminary cost estimate for the development program given below is restricted to the silicon detectors only and excludes costs connected with the development of complete detector modules. Thus only costs for the production and tests of functional behaviour and radiation sensitivity of detectors are included, not however the tests of wafers together with readout electronics.

Production costs of detector prototypes in the Munich semiconductor laboratory is somewhat difficult to estimate. A large fraction of the cost is in keeping the laboratory in operation. This cost is nearly independent of the number of projects being worked at. In addition investments for the extension of the capabilities of the laboratory are being made. Some of these additional investments are of general nature as e.g. for the improvement of the metallization process or the photolithography. Others are peculiar to a specific experiment as e.g. the development of p-type detectors, radiation hard oxide or low cost structuring methods for strip detectors.

The general running and investment cost of the laboratory after the now finished initial setup period is expected to be roughly 2 MDM/year. Roughly 20% of the activities corresponding to 400kDM equipment and consumables will be connected with the ATLAS strip detector development. The following list contains only yearly additional expenditures which are specific to this proposal.
