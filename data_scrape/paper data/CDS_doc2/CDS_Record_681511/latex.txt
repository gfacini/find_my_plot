###### Abstract

This document presents the first comparison of experimental data taken during the Summer 2002 at H8 with a Geant4 simulation. The current work investigates the secondary particles production by muons and their possible impact on track segment reconstruction in comparison with Geant4 predictions. The basic elements of the analysis are the reconstructed track segments on each of the three MDT stations of the testbeam set-up.

The H8 geometry and the muon beam characteristics are simulated in detail as well as the MDT chamber response and inefficiencies (dead or noisy drift tubes) in order to achieve a complete description of secondary particle production in dense material targets. The analysis is performed using reconstructed track segments as basic elements.

The purpose of the work described in this note is twofold: to provide simulation of the data collected by the three barrel MDT stations for track reconstruction and alignment studies and to perform validation studies of the Geant4 physics content. Comparisons (simulation/data) of secondary particles produced by muon electromagnetic interactions with materials, in an experimental environment similar to the ALTAS one, constitute an important validation step for the Geant4 simulation. Here the reliability of the developed Geant4 code is validated through the comparison with experimental data. The agreement found can be estimated at the level of 1% absolute.

## Introduction

A large scale system test is being performed in H8 experimental area at CERN. As described in [1] and in [2] the set-up includes twelve Monitored Drift Tube (MDT) chambers arranged to emulate one barrel tower (six barrel MDTs) and a wedge of one endcap octant (six endcap MDTs).

On the grounds of similar studies already performed for the H8 and X5 testbeam [3], in the present work particular attention is put in reproducing an experimental environment similar to the ATLAS one and to test the capability of Geant4 of correctly reproducing the physics of energetic \(\delta\)-rays leaving signals through many MDTs layers.

In Section I the H8 experimental set-up and beam features are briefly summarised. Section II is dedicated to the description of the geometry implemented for the H8 testbeam simulation and to the simulated muon beam. The analysis strategy of the testbeam data and some basic element definitions are described in Sections III A and III B. The reliability of the simulation tuning on experimental data is dealt with in Section III C. The study of secondary particles and their possible impact on muon track reconstruction are described in Section III D where simulation/data comparison and results are presented. A brief outlook on what is expected for the test beam runs foreseen for the spring-summer 2003 is given in Section IV. Finally, in Section V, the main topics are summarised and some conclusions are drawn.

## I The H8 muon experimental set-up

Since the year 2000 a real size system test of the ATLAS Muon Spectrometer is being performed in the H8 experimental area. The test has evolved achieving in 2002 a set-up which includes twelve MDTs equipped with close-to-final electronics and complete alignment system. More details on experimental set-up and on the general scientific program of the test can be found in [1] and [2].

A schematic view of the H8 barrel experimental set-up is shown in FIG.1. The six chambers are positioned on the beam at an angle of approximatively 15 degrees to reproduce the projective geometry of an ALTAS barrel sector. The MDT chambers are organized in three stations: Inner, Medium and Outer placed at about 5 m, 7 m, and 10 m respectively from the interaction point. The naming scheme adopted is the standard ATLAS: BIL (Barrel Inner Large chambers), BML (Barrel Medium Large chambers) and BOL (Barrel Outer Large chambers). Each station consists of a pair of large MDT chambers. The MDT dimensions are increasing (projective coverage) going from the Inner chambers to the Outer ones. The chambers have been numbered from one to six following the scheme shown in FIG.1 (from to interaction point outwards).

The H8 beam contains muons with an energy that can be set in the range between 20 GeV up to 180 GeV. The typical beam size is of 3 cm RMS and increases up to 30 cm RMS when the beam is defocused. Typical muon rates are of the order 100 Hz/cm\({}^{2}\) with the high-energy focused beam. A beam magnet has been placed in front of the muon stand in order to steer the beam and to reproduce muons at different angles coming from the ATLAS interaction point. When the magnetic field is off, the core of the beam passes very close tothe transition region between chambers owing to the same station and the odd chambers (BIL1, BML3 and BOL5) are the ones with the largest beam illumination.

Two blocks of dense material (Iron and Aluminum) can be either placed upstream the chamber triplets or in between the BIL and BML stations as targets to study the particle production by muons in terms of shower composition and energy loss.

The trigger system consists of alternatively an hodoscope, about 1 m\({}^{2}\) surface covered by two layers of (10 cm\(\times\)1 m) scintillator strips, or a (10\(\times\)10) cm\({}^{2}\) trigger composed by two scintillator planes placed 20 cm apart, along the beam line and upstream the magnet. The MDTs are equipped with shaping, amplification and discriminator electronics very similar to the one chosen for ALTAS. More details on the chamber readout and DAQ system can be found in [1] and [2].

## II The Testbeam Simulation

### Simulation Topics and Data Samples

The simulation of highly energetic muons interacting with the H8 chambers and materials is performed with Geant4 (version 4.4.0) in the FADS (Framework for ATLAS Detector Simulation) framework [4] developed for the ATLAS experiment. After an extensive program of Geant4-physics validations, H8 samples of experimental data give the opportunity to validate the Geant4 electromagnetic physics content at the muon energies delivered in the 2002 testbeam (20 GeV and 180 GeV).

The geometry of the H8 set-up is described by an external ASCII database (amdb_simrec.H8.2002) following the AMDB SIMREC format [5] used for the ATLAS-wide simulation and reconstruction of the entire Muon System. FIG.2 shows a three-dimensional view of the simulated H8 testbeam chambers with the muon beam crossing the three MDT stations (using VRMLVIEW, the Geant4 vizualization tool). The chamber positions in the global system, the mutual positions of the components and the internal chamber structures are considered and described in full detail. In the present simulation, a set of classes redirects information about chamber positions, sizes, chamber materials and internal structures in the same way as implemented in the simulation of the whole Muon Spectrometer.

All the physics processes for muons interacting with the MTD chambers, such as \(\delta\)-ray production, multiple scattering and specific energy loss (\(dE/dx\)), are considered and could be put on/off depending on the different analysis purposes, using the physics list in the standard version for ATLAS ("AtlasPhysicsList", see [6]).

Simulated muons interact with materials along their path causing ionization of the tube gas (the sensitive volume) in the drift tubes of the MDT chambers. In particular when a tracked particle exits a drift tube wall, a straight line in the direction of the particle three-momentum is created. The distance \(r\) of this line from the wire, the _impact parameter_, is transformed into a drift time according to a realistic \(r-t\) relation (i.e., determined from the testbeam data) read from an external file. FIG.3 shows a schematic view of a muon track crossing the MDT drift tubes. Circles inside drift tubes represent the impact parameters converted by the simulation into drift times according to the \(r-t\) relation. The digitization takes into account a gaussian smearing of the drift radius according to the proper tube resolution function. For the present studies the signal propagation along the wire is not considered. The contribution of this effect to the drift radius resolution is estimated to be negligible (less then 10 \(\mu\)m) with the trigger set-up ((10\(\times\)10) cm\({}^{2}\) scintillator) used in this work.

In order to emulate the behaviour of the MDT front end electronics (700ns imposed dead time after each valid hit) when more than one particle hits a tube within the same 700 ns time buffer, only the first signal is recorded, corresponding to the hit associated to the lower drift time. The additional hits in the tube are then discarded.

During the tracking, hits are recorded together with the corresponding impact parameter, drift time and position in the global coordinate reference system. The detector element in which the hit occurs is labelled by chamber and volume types, according to the identifier scheme adopted in the Muon System description [7]. At the end of each event a muon hit collection and a digit collection are built according to the digitization algorithm adopted. On demand the program dumps the full list of hits and digits information. The output format is ASCII, readable by the standard reconstruction programs used in the Muon System (Muonbox and Calib). Event and hit information is also stored in a column-wise ntuple and in a set of predefined histograms.

Several set-up constraints at H8 are included in the simulation. In particular, only those tubes equipped with the frontend electronics (twelve for each layer of the two BIL and twenty-four for each layer of the BML and BOL chambers) can collect hits. The presence of low-efficiency tubes (two in the BIL and two in the BML station) is taken into account in the simulation in agreement with a dedicated study on dead channels in data samples. The electronic noise is simulated according to an external mapping quoting the noise probability per tube per event, as evaluated run by run by the data analysis program Calib.

Different samples of events are generated (for a total amount of more than 100k events) at different energies in different experimental conditions, adding and removing blocks of material in the geometry set-up at the same mutual distances from the muon chambers as in the H8 experimental set-up. The complete sample list appears in TABLE 1. The Iron block, \((27\times 10\times 10)\) cm\({}^{3}\) (where the longer edge is along the beam line and corresponds to \(15.3X_{0}\)), is placed 32 cm upstream the BIL station or 84 cm from the BML station, according to the two possible set-ups. The Aluminum \((40\times 10\times 10)\) cm\({}^{3}\) block, corresponding to \(4.5X_{0}\), has been placed 37 cm upstream the BIL station or 84 cm from the BML station.

The correspondent list of selected data runs, available at the H8 testbeam web page [8], can be found in TABLE 2. The experimental data samples analysed in this work refer to the August-September 2002 data taking period. The muon beam momentum was set to 20 GeV and beam and detector set-up and running conditions remained unchanged across the different samples. The magnet current was set to zero and the transversal dimensions of the beam spot were fixed by the (10\(\times\)10) cm\({}^{2}\) trigger used. A "reference" run, without Iron or Aluminum absorbers, has been choosen for the simulation tuning, as described in the next paragraph.

### The H8 \(\mu\) Beam Simulation

The detailed simulation of the H8 muon beam is crucial to achieve a good description of the experimental data. The geometrical profile of the beam has been reproduced after an accurate comparison between Geant4 and data (run 10917) hit distributions at each layer of each station. Several event samples without material in front of the three stations have been simulated for different values of the beam parameters. In FIG.5 the beam profiles on a single layer of the first multilayer of BIL, BML and BOL stations are shown as a function of the tube number. All the distributions are normalized to unit area. The tuning of Geant4 to the experimental beam profiles lead to the final parameter choice listed in TABLE 3.

The simulated beam origin with a suitable spread is placed at the exit face of the magnet in the set-up. The beam vertex positions in the global reference system are distributed according to a convolution between a gaussian and a uniform shape. The final tune for the simulated beam lead to a pseudorapidity gaussian distribution of about 0.27 rad and a 0.0041 rad spread.

The real muon beam momentum profile (according to [9]) has been taken into account for reproducing the H8 muon momentum. FIG.4 shows the simulated momentum distribution, peaked at the nominal 20 GeV value. For the simulated samples at higher beam energy of Section IV a similar \(dp/p\) profile is assumed, normalized to the correct maximum peak momentum.

Parameters resulting in TABLE 3 have been adopted for the final event production listed in TABLE 1.

## III The analysis of testbeam data

### The Analysis Strategy

In order to study the Geant4 capability to simulate the production of energetic \(\delta\)-rays by muons interacting with the H8 chambers, the following strategy has been adopted:

* data collected with and without the presence of dense material blocks (Iron and Aluminium, placed in front of the BIL station or in between the BIL and the BML stations) have been selected;
* energetic secondaries from simulation or real data, with or without the additional material, have been compared;
* the basic element used to analyze the secondary production is the _track segment._

This strategy allows a cleaning-up of the uncertainty related to the presence of material upstream of the muon experimental area (iron dump for hadron absorbing, magnet material, etc.), not included yet in the simulation. Moreover, as will be extensively discussed in Section III.4, a track segment analysis is less sensitive to chamber noise with respect, for instance, to an extra hit-based study. This analysis requires a high tuning of the reconstruction efficiency.

### Basic Element Definitions

Track segments have been reconstructed using Calib reconstruction program [10] (version v4r3). This reconstruction code is able to read both the output ASCII file from the simulation and the testbeam data in binary format and to reconstruct one track segment for each MDT station. Calib code has also been used to calculate the \(t_{0}\) (determined for each block of consecutive runs) and the \(r-t\) relation (determined with CALIB for each chamber type -BIL, BML, BOL- and assumed to be the same for all the runs) needed to the simulation to convert the drift distance of the track from the wire into a drift time in TDC counts.

Different requirements on the reconstructed track segment have influence on the energy spectra of the reconstructed secondaries. For this reason comparisons between data and simulation have been performed for _several track segment definitions_ depending on two parameters: the minimum number of hits per chamber (\(minHits\)) and the maximum number of missing hits (\(missHits\)). The first quantity refers to the definition of different event categories as a function of the recorded number of hits per chamber, the second one is referring to the need of defining the measurement quality. Three categories of reconstructed track segments have been evaluated:

* \(minHits=4\) and \(missHits=2\): this configuration requires at least one hit on the second multilayer for the track segment to be accepted;
* \(minHits=3\) and \(missHits=4\): at least three hits on one of the two multilayers (of each chamber) to reconstruct the track segment;
* \(minHits=3\) and \(missHits=3\): three hits on one of the two multilayers for BML and BOL chambers and at least on hit on both multilayers for BIL.

These minimum track reconstruction requirements can be passed to Calib code via run datacards. For each configuration, two different \(\chi^{2}\) thresholds have been adopted for reconstructing track segments.

### Check of Simulation Tuning

After tuning the beam parameters to obtain the best agreement simulation/data at the level of hit distributions, the reconstruction level has been checked through a comparison of reconstruction efficiency, \(\chi^{2}\) and residual distributions.

The _reconstruction efficiency_ is defined as the number of events with at least one reconstructed track segment out of the total number of generated events. The reconstruction efficiency for the three testbeam stations is shown in FIG.6 (a) when the track segment reconstruction requirements are \(minHits=3\), \(missHits=3\) and \(\chi^{2}=10\). The agreement data/simulation is well within 2% overall. For the BOL station the efficiency is close to one. For the BML chambers the efficiency decreases due to the reconstruction inefficiency in the transition region between two adjacent chambers since each chamber is independently treated at reconstruction level in Calib. This inefficiency is well reproduced by the simulation. The reconstruction efficiency further decreases for the BIL station due to the demanding request of at least one additional hit on the second multilayer of each chamber to reconstruct the track segment on these chambers.

FIG.6 (b) shows the reconstruction efficiency for the configuration \(minHits=3\), \(missHits\) = 4 when \(\chi^{2}=10\). For the BIL station efficiency increases with respect to FIG.6 (a) since three hits per multilayer are enough, in this case, to reconstruct segments for any chamber type. The strictest configuration (\(minHits=4\) and \(missHits=2\)) represented in FIG.6 (c) shows how the aforementioned reconstruction inefficiency for segments on adjacent chambers is much more evident in the BML than in the other two stations, due to the geometry of the beam impact point.

In FIG.7 the normalized \(\chi^{2}\)_distributions_ for the reconstruction on simulated muons and on real data are shown when \(minHits=4\) and \(missHits=2\). Simulated and experimental distributions match better for \(\chi^{2}<10\) with respect to higher \(\chi^{2}\) values. Nevertheless, even for \(\chi^{2}>10\) the agreement is reasonable taking into account that the distribution tail has a low population.

In FIG.8, the normalized _residual distributions_ are plotted for the \(minHits=4\), \(missHits=2\) and \(\chi^{2}=10\) configuration for the first (left) and second (right) multilayer of the odd chambers of each station (BIL1, BML3 and BOL5). A quantitative comparison od the normalized curves shows an agreement simulation/data within few percent. When \(\chi^{2}=100\) differences in the tails appear, but the core of the distributions remains well reproduced by the simulation.

The _multilayer resolution_, defined as the variance of the residual distribution, is represented in FIG.9 for the BIL1, BML3 and BOL5 multilayers and for two different segment track definitions: \(minHits=4\) and \(missHits=2\) and \(\chi^{2}=10\) (left)and \(minHits=3\) and \(missHits=3\) and \(\chi^{2}=10\) (right).

### Study of energetic secondary particles

The core of the analysis focuses on energetic secondary particles produced by muon interactions and their possible impact on track segment reconstruction.

In Geant4 and in testbeam data, events with more than one reconstructed track segment (i.e. with at least one secondary track) have been selected. The amount of energetic secondaries and their effect on the track reconstruction efficiency has been evaluated. A track segment analysis is motivated by the observation that track segments are less sensitive to chamber noise with respect to an extra hits analysis as in [3]. This study requires an optimal reconstruction efficiency for single particle events (i.e., events without energetic secondaries).

To avoid the effects of not simulated dead material present in the experimental set-up, the obervables which describe the secondary particles have been defined in terms of difference between the "material block in" and the "no-material" configurations. For each station, \(R_{21}\) is defined as the fraction of events with two or more reconstructed track segments with respect to the number of events with at least one reconstructed segment. The difference between \(R_{12}\) evaluated in the material configuration and in absence of the absorber block defines the quantity \(\delta_{ratio}\)

\[\delta_{ratio}=R_{12}(\text{absorber})-R_{12}(\text{no absorber}). \tag{1}\]

The reliability of the simulation is evaluated trough the difference between \(\delta_{ratio}\) calculated separately for the testbeam and for the Geant4 data

\[\delta(\text{data}-\text{Geant}4)=\delta_{ratio}(\text{data})-\delta_{ratio }(\text{Geant}4). \tag{2}\]In FIG.10\(\delta(\mbox{data}-\mbox{Geant4})\) is shown when \(minHits=3\), \(missHits=4\) and \(\chi^{2}=10\). In this configuration three hits per multilayer are the minimal requirement for segment reconstruction in each station. Data are well reproduced by the simulation, the number of extra track segments per event is of the order of 2%. When the Iron block is in between the BIL and BML stations, the simulation seems to underestimate the number of track segments. When the block material is Aluminum, the Geant4/data agreement is always below the 1% absolute in any of the analyzed configurations.

In TABLE IV the reconstruction efficiencies for different materials, set-up choices and segment definitions are summarised. The material presence has a small impact on the efficiency (\(<2\%\)). The systematic error due to change in beam condition is estimated to be of the order of 2% while the statistical error is of about 0.2%.

## IV Outlook

For the 2003 testbeam at H8 several runs with high momentum muons are foreseen. Data for primaries with momentum up to 200 GeV will allow to broaden the investigation of secondary particle and their effect on the muon reconstruction.

A sample of 10k events from 200 GeV primary muons has been simulated and distributions of secondary particles compared to the 20 GeV ones. In FIG.11 (left) the secondary particle energy spectrum with the Iron block placed in front of the BIL chamber is shown. Secondaries from 200 GeV muon interactions have a wider distribution and their multiplicity overwhelms the 20 GeV one by almost one order of magnitude in the range between 200 and 1200 MeV. Similar results appear with the Aluminum block.

FIG.11 (right) shows the \(\delta_{ratio}\) for the two beam energies when the absorber is Iron, for a given track segment definition. The extra track fraction is of the order of 5% (4% in case of Aluminum) in the BIL station or in the BML station according to the block position. Comparisons in the extra track content of muon beams as a function of the incident beam energy should be investigated in the next 2003 data taking period.

## V Conclusions

In the present work secondary particles produced by 20 GeV muon beam and their impact on track segment reconstruction by MDT chambers have been studied by comparing real data and Geant4 simulation. The simulation code adopted has been refined and tuned in order to include a realistic \(r-t\) relation and hit digitization, a geometry description very close to the H8 one, a detailed muon beam description, a dump of hit information in an ASCII file readable by the reconstruction program. A good agreement between simulated and experimental testbeam data has been reached at the reconstruction level in terms of residuals and single-muon reconstruction efficiency.

The analysis of secondary particle production in dense material targets has been performed comparing Geant4 and testbeam data. For the 20 GeV muon beam the fraction of events with more than one track segment is at the level of 3-5%, depending on the different track segment definition considered. Agreement between Geant4 simulation and experimental data is at the level of, or better than, the 1% absolute.

The impact of extra-material on the track segment reconstruction efficiency is found to be below 2% for both testbeam data and Geant4 simulation.
