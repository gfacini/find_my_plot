We show that an MSGC of 200\(\mu\)m pitch, 3.2 mm drift gap, operating with \(\Lambda\)r(50)/ DME(50) at a gas gain approximately equal to the readout electronics noise measured in electrons, has an efficiency of \(>\) 98% and spatial resolution of 40\(\mu\)m with analogue readout or 50\(\mu\)m with binary readout. This performance is not affected when the chamber is bombarded with particles at a rate of 5 \(\times\) 10\({}^{4}\) m.i.p.s mm\({}^{-2}\) s\({}^{-1}\).

**1. Construction of Chambers**

All chambers were built from 0.5 micron thick aluminium on a substrate of S-8900 glass. Deposition of the aluminium and lithography was done by VTT (Finland). All had 10 micron wide anodes and the cathode width was 62 microns with 200 micron pitch or 86 microns with 250 micron pitch. The anode and cathode strips were about 70 mm long and all of the data was taken with the beam spot near the middle of the strips. The drift space was defined by a drift cathode made from either a strectched sheet of aluminised mylar or an aluminised sheet of glass. The drift gap was 3.2 mm in the Manchester chambers and 3.0 mm in the RAL chambers.

**2. Positions of Chambers**

The position of the test track was measured with three standard RAL chambers which have a pitch of 300 microns and a position resolution of about 80 microns. These chambers were placed at positions along the beam (z direction) of 0, 375 and 2325 mm. The first and last chambers had vertical strips so they measured in the horizontal (x) direction. The chamber at 375 mm had horizontal strips and was used to check that the vertical strips of the other RAL and Manchester chambers were really parallel to each other to better than 20 microns in 5 mm. Having done this check, no further use was made of this RAL chamber.

The Manchester chambers were divided into four areas with 150, 200, 250 and 300 micron pitch. We concentrated on measuring the 200 and 250 micron pitch areas because this is the range of pitches most likely to be used in Atlas. The chambers were placed with strips vertical and at z positions of 175 and 575 mm. Thus they were interleaved with the first two RAL chambers and the last RAL chamber was a long way downstream, giving it a long lever arm for accurate measurement of the track angle.

**3. Event selection using the RAL chambers**

Hits were formed in the RAL chambers by requiring samples in two successive time bins to be above 8 counts. Clusters were made from groups of adjacent hit strips. The position of the cluster was taken to be the centre of gravity of its hits and the cluster time was the time of the earliest hit. Cuts were made which required just one cluster in each of the RAL chambers and this cluster had to be at the expected time within 75 ns and to have a width of less than 4 strips. Drawing a straight line between the cluster positions in the vertical RAL chambers allowed us to measure the angle of the track in the horizontaldirection with an accuracy of 49 microradians. The track impact point in the Manchester chambers was predicted with an accuracy of 75 microns. We also required that the angle between the track and the average beam direction be less than 1 milliradian in order to remove events with badly measured tracks or large multiple scattering angles. Finally, the predicted track impact point in both Manchester chambers must be inside the sensitive area of these chambers by more than two pitches.

**4. Signal Definition in the Manchester Chambers**

Ideally we would like to process the signal as will be done in ATLAS, for example with double correlated sampling, but in fact we used preamps which have a rise time of 20 ns and a fall time of 30 ns followed by sampling with the DL300 flash \(\Lambda\)DC at 25 ns intervals. The drift field was 5 KV/cm which has a predicted drift velocity in Ar(50)/DME(50) of 50 microns/ns, giving a maximum drift time of 64 ns. We do not (yet?) know the time of the beam particle relative to the phase of the FADC clock. These limitations mean that the signal is typically spread over three or four time bins. For the sake of simplicity we have formed a strip signal by summing the FADC values over three time bins (numbers 13,14 and 15) which typically include the great majority of the signal. This is approximately equivalent to integrating the whole signal and should give the same result as double correlated sampling with an integration time of 75 ns.

Calibration was done with a test pulse injecting known charge into each preamplifier, giving a result of 1 FADC count = 1770 elections. The pedestal and its r.m.s. was measured in each channel by using seven time bins which precede the arrival of the track. Pedestals were always close to 5 counts, where they had been set by the online program, and the mean r.m.s. was 1.8 counts, corresponding to a noise of 3200 electrons. There is some noise correlation between bins so the noise of the three bin sum is not \(\sqrt{3}\times 1.8\) but 2.7 counts or 4780 electrons. This noise is more than twice what we expect to have with ATLAS front end electronics so we had to run the chambers at twice the gain in order to achieve a similar performance.

**5. Efficiency Measurement**

The chamber efficiency and background was measured as a function of threshold by selecting the three strips closest to the extrapolated track point. The maximum of the three strip signals is plotted as the dashed line in Figure 1. Also in Figure 1, the solid line is the maximum of three noise signals taken from the same three strips 175 ns before the arrival of the track. It can be seen that a cut at around 10 FADC counts gives good discrimination between signal and noise. The inset of Figure 1 shows how the fraction of events with a signal above threshold (ie. Efficiency) and the fraction of events with noise above threshold (ie. Background) varies as the threshold is changed. For comparison between different runs we choose to mesure the efficiency with the threshold at 10 counts.

**6. Cluster Definition**

A threshold of 10 counts was used to define a hit strip. A group of hit strips is formed into a cluster, where gaps of just one missing strip are allowed to be skipped. The charge is defined as the sum of the charges in all strips in the cluster. The cluster width is the number of strips in the cluster, including any which were skipped. Three methods have been tried for measuring the cluster position. The binary position is just the half-way point along the cluster. The analogue position is the centre of gravity of the charge in each hit of the cluster. The neighbour position is the same as analogue except that the neighbour hits on each side of the cluster are included in the calculation because they may contain some charge even though they were below threshold.

Events were selected which had just one such cluster in each Manchester chamber. Since we have already selected good tracks with the RAL chambers and we know from the previous section that the threshold is well placed at 10 counts it is not surprising that the probability of events passing this last cut is very high, typically 94%.

After this cut the cluster width and charge was histogrammed (Figure 2). The cluster charge was converted to a mesurement of gain assuming that the track produces an average of 14.4 ion pairs mm\({}^{-1}\) (4.56 clusters mm\({}^{-1}\)\(\times\) 2.1 ions per cluster \(\times\) 1.5 for the relativistic rise because we used 120 GeV/c pions ).

**7. Spatial Resolution**

A scatter plot of the positions of the two analogue clusters (Figure 3) shows a lot of structure. This is due to the 50% of clusters which are just one hit strip.

If the beam had been truly parallel it would have been very difficult to extract the position resolution of the chambers from Figure 3, but we are saved by the divergence of the beam which is adding significantly to the width of the diagonal band.

When we take the difference between the cluster positions in the two chambers and correct for the track angle which was measured by the RAL chambers we get the results in Figure 4. The structure has been smeared out sufficiently to have little effect on the r.m.s.'s of these plots. The track angle correction itself is often quantised in steps of 51.6\(\mu\)m ( = 300\(\mu\)m \(\times\)400/2325) because the RAL chambers often have just one hit strip each. We get the position resolution from the r.m.s.'s of Figure 4 by first subtracting in quadrature 20 microns which is the error due to the track angle uncertainty and then dividing by \(\sqrt{2}\). The third histogram in Figure 4 is sufficiently smooth that we can measure its width by fitting a Gaussian plus a flat background to it. The sigma of the Gaussian is significantly narrower than the r.m.s. of the histogram and flat background contains 2.8% of the events. A better estimate of the true position resolution of the chamber is derived from this fit and is given in brackets in the summary table.

**8. Results**

Three runs in which the 200 micron pitch area of the Manchester chambers were in the beam have been analysed. First run 1175 in which the cathode voltage was 605V, this gave the plots featured in Figures 1 to 4. The cathodes were then increased to 625 V in run 1176 and the results were very similar, as shown in the summary table below. The increased gain led to a very slight increase in efficiency and a better analogue position resolution but a worsening of the digital position resolution. In run 1178, with the cathodes still at 625V the beam intensity was increased to aproximately \(5\times 10^{4}\) particles mm\({}^{-2}\) s\({}^{-1}\) over an area of \(3\times 6\) mm\({}^{2}\) in the centre of the sensitive part of the chambers (maximum rate expected in ATLAS is \(2\times 10^{4}\) mm\({}^{-2}\) s\({}^{-1}\)). This led to a slight drop in gain and the changes in the other parameters are no more that would be expected from the reduced gain.

The 250 micron pitch region was operated with the cathodes at 615V in run 1193 and 635V in run 1194. The 250 micron structure had approximately the same gain at a given voltage as the 200 micron pitch structure, as is needed for a keystone chamber. Since the pitch is now larger but the diffusion has not changed, each cluster is now more likely to be just one strip, which causes the analogue resolution to suffer more from the increase of pitch than does the digital resolution.
