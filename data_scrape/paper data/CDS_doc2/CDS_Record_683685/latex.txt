Several approaches for the longitudinal and transversal segmentation of the Extended Barrel Modules 0 and the methodology for the routing of the fibers have been proposed. The aim of this document is the comparative study of several options in order to select the geometry of the cells and the routing of the fibers to be implemented in the modules.

The guidelines to help us in the choices are the following:

* non-uniformity of light yield inside the cells should be small (\(\leq\) 5%),
* fiber length should be minimum, for maximum photo-statistics (\(>\) 20 p.e./GeV at least), minimum cost and minimum fiber direct response to ionizing particles,
* cells should be projective as much as possible,
* granularity should be \(\Delta\eta\)=0.1 in the first and second samplings and 0.2 in the third sampling,
* each sample should be thick enough to be able to detect muon signals,
* since the calorimeter has a thickness of about 9 to 18 \(\lambda\), the hadronic showers are not completely contained and the last sampling of the calorimeter should be a useful 'tail catcher' to help on the reconstruction of late showers,
* the number of holes in the profiles which support the fibers should be as small as possible and the different types of profiles should be minimum to allow the most effective operation of the fiber insertion machine,
* the number of PMTs and fibers should be as small as possible to minimize the cost,
* the number of different fiber lengths should be small to optimize the automation of the fiber insertion, and to decrease the spread of light from cell to cell in each sample.

One of the geometries, presented in the November 1996 Atlas week, follows essentially the strategy adopted for the routing of the Barrel Module 0. It will be called the geometry "a la barrel" or "3-6-2" [1], and it is shown in the left side of Fig. 1. This proposal suffered some developments and the last configuration is shown in the left side of Fig. 2. For this type of geometry ("3-6-2"), the main development was not in the extended barrel but in the barrel module, and it was the introduction of symmetry around \(\eta\)=0 for the cells of sampling D, allowing to save 2 PMTs in each barrel module (128 PMTs in total) while keeping the granularity \(\Delta\eta\)=0.2 in the last sampling of the calorimeter.

The other geometry is the MSU proposal [2], called "3-4-4" (with D8, D9) and the essential of the geometry is the enlargement of sampling D at expenses of shortening sampling BC. The original version had 5 cells in sampling D (D5 to D9), see right side of Fig. 1. Although this geometry was presented with the aim of saving fibers, some other features show advantages when compared with the "3-6-2" geometry. With the aim of saving cost we have proposed a small modification in this geometry ("3-4-4" without D8, D9), reducing to 3 the number of cells in sample D, as can be seen in the right side of Fig. 2. To allow that, the number of fibers in cells D6 and D7 is adjusted in order to have a maximum of 150 fibers in D7, the maximum imposed by the light mixer and the PMT photo-cathode area.

The combination of cells A16 and B15 to form cell AB16 and save 2 PMTs per extended barrel module is possible in both geometries. To keep the number of fibers in cell AB16 below 150, cells A15 and B14 need to be enlarged by 12 half-periods.

In summary, two proposals were under discussion ("3-6-2" and "3-4-4") and in the next section we present a comparative study with advantages and disadvantages for each one. The small modifications (with or without D8 and D9 cells, with or without combining cells A16 and B15) are also discussed.

## 2 Comparison of the geometries

The most important parameters that can help in the choice of the geometry are summarized in a quantitative way in Table 1. The cells A16, B15 and the ITC

Figure 1: Proposed cell geometries for the Extended Barrel Modules 0 in an early version. At left it is shown the so called “3-6-2” and at right the so called “3-4-4”. The versions shown have separate cells A16 and B15, and the version of the “3-4-4” geometry shown includes D8 and D9 cells.

(Intermediate TileCal) are discussed separately in section 3. The parameters are described below.

The uniformity value is the maximum non-uniformity calculated using tile and fiber parametrizations as described in Tilecal Note 107 [3]. The fiber lengths used for the "3-4-4" configurations are approximate values for each sampling, assuming that the fiber path to the PMTs are the shortest possible1: 205 and 195 cm for 'long' and'short' fibers of sampling A, 176 and 163 cm for sampling B and 152 and 137 cm for sampling D.

Footnote 1: The typical values of the ’long’ fibers implemented in the US module with MSU routing were 253 cm for sampling A, 224 cm for sampling B and 170 cm for sampling D

The variable used for the projectivity is the ratio of areas (area of cell contained within boundary \(\eta\) lines)/(area of cell), with the boundary \(\eta\) lines starting at 0.9 and separated by 0.1, and was estimated for all the cells. The values presented in table 1 for each sampling are the averages for the cells of the sampling.

The S/N for muons is the approximate signal/noise ratio for muons, considering only electronic noise. Values were estimated using the data from Fig. 6-40 of the Tilecal TDR (Module 0 results) [4], for an \(\eta\) value near 1.1 and muons crossing the cells far from their edges. The ratio decreases when the muons cross the calorimeter near the cell edges.

The thickness of sampling D is expressed in cm and also as the fraction of the Tilecal thickness. It is related with the sensitivity to identify late showers.

The number and total length of fibers were calculated without taking into account the ITC. The number of PMTs does not include the ones of the ITC scintillators, and assumes that C9 is an independent cell. It is also assumed that B15 and A16 are two independent cells.

### Summary of the geometries

In terms of uniformity inside the cells, the 2 geometries are similar, except in the D sampling where the "3-6-2" is more uniform than the "3-4-4". In the BC sampling the "3-6-2" geometry is slightly less uniform, due to the larger depth of the BC cells in this geometry.

Using the ratio of areas defined in the previous section to measure the projectivity, in the "3-6-2" geometry it is about 15% better than in geometry "3-4-4" (without D8, D9) for samplings BC and D. The two "3-4-4" versions only differ in cells of sampling D, having practically the same projectivity.

The muon signal is visible in both geometries for muons that completely traverse the cells at an \(\eta\) value near 1.1, as it is shown by the S/N values presented in table 1. In the worst case of the muon path being equally divided by 2 cells of the same sampling, the S/N values are reduced to half of the values presented in the table. The situation is different for the low p\({}_{T}\) muons that may be fully absorbed in the calorimeter, as it was pointed out in [6], having then a smaller signal in the last sampling. In that case, the "3-4-4" geometry is better because the respective last sampling (D cells) starts at a lower radius, allowing a more balanced distribution in the muon signal between cells BC and D.

Sampling D, the 'tail catcher' is intended to have an average energy deposited small, but non-negligible. In the barrel modules, at small \(\eta\) values, the ATLAS thickness in material, from the beam pipe to the Tilec

about 9 \(\lambda_{l}\)[4]. Sampling D contributes with 1.9 \(\lambda_{l}\) in the "3-6-2" geometry and with 3.4 \(\lambda_{l}\) in the "3-4-4" geometry, at \(\eta\)=0. Taking as an example the shower of 210 GeV pions [5], the average energy deposited beyond 9 \(\lambda_{l}\) is of the order of 1%.The average energy deposited beyond 7.1 \(\lambda_{l}\) is of the order of 4%, so about 3% of the energy is deposited in the sampling D of the "3-6-2" geometry. If the "3-4-4" geometry is applied to the barrel, the average energy deposited in sampling D grows to about 8%, which is an appreciable fraction of the energy deposited in the Tilecal. It should be noted that the fraction of the energy of 210 GeV pions deposited in Tilecal is only about 45% of the total energy.

In the extended barrel region, the amount of material in the \(\eta\) range from 0.9 to 1.2 varies from 9 to 18 \(\lambda_{l}\), with about 13\(\lambda_{l}\) near \(\eta\)=1.1. In the geometry "3-6-2", the amount of material in front of sampling D is then about 10\(\lambda_{l}\), so the energy deposited in sampling D by the 210 GeV pions is negligible, making the sampling D almost useless. In the case of the "3-4-4" geometry, the amount of material in front of sampling D reduces to about 7 \(\lambda_{l}\), so the average energy deposited in sampling D is about 3%, making it a 'tail catcher'.

The idea about the "3-4-4" was to simplify the construction and to save in the cost, essentially reducing the number of fibers and channels. In fact it does not reduce the number of PMTs (except in the version without D8, D9 cells) but it reduces the number of holes in the profiles, so it reduces the cost in manpower to drill the holes. Additionally it fastens the fiber insertion. The time for the fiber insertion procedure is minimized if the "3-4-4" geometry is also applied to the barrel. In the case of different geometries in the barrel and in the extended barrels, the number of types of profiles increases to 4, complicating the fiber insertion machine and the respective operation. The consequences of this last point in the cost of the machine and insertion operation are being evaluated.

As a general conclusion about the geometries, we point out the following:

* the "3-4-4" saves in cost and is better from the implementation point of view since there are less fibers.
* from the performance point of view that has been considered here, the "3-4-4" geometry seems to be better in the extended barrel while the "3-6-2" remains better for the barrel. Simulation could help to clarify better this point.
* in case of doubt it was considered the instrumentation of one configuration in the Argonne module and the other one in the Barcelona module. The final decision was to use only the "3-4-4" geometry in both extended barrel modules due to the advantages pointed out in the two previous conclusions.

The AB16 and the Intermediate TileCal cells

The ITC (Intermediate TileCal) consists of a calorimeter plug instrumented with iron an tiles, plus 4 large scintillator tiles in the 60 cm gap between the barrel and the extended barrel modules. The ITC is intended to recover information lost in the crack, so the respective cells should be relatively small and be contained within the crack to be very sensitive to what happens in front of them. If they become large with the addition of some neighbour tiles of the extended barrel, sensitivity in the crack is lost. But in order to save cost, some cells in the region of the ITC could be merged. In principle, cell C9 could merge with cell D5 in the "3-4-4" geometry, and cell C9 could merge with C10 in the "3-6-2" geometry, resulting in a reduction of 2 PMTs per module. Simulation results can help to know if the performance is good enough with the cells merged, or if the separation of cells is necessary.

About the AB16 cell, it was done to save 2 PMTs per extended barrel module. As pointed out in [6], there are not so many \(\lambda_{I}\) in the hadronic end-cap at \(\eta\) values around 1.6, so it may be a good idea to keep it divided in 2 cells, A16 and B15. The 2 PMTs may be saved with the merging of cells in the ITC referred above, or adopting the "3-4-4" geometry without D8 and D9 cells, at expenses of having larger D6 and D7 cells.

## 4 Comparison of routings

Two routing schemes have been proposed. The first one was developed by the Lisbon group and implemented in the Barrel Module 0 [7, 3], and the second one was developed by the MSU group [2]. The main parameters of the 2 methods are summarized in table 2.

In order to minimize the non-uniformity inside the cells, both methods assume that there are only 2 fiber lengths inside each cell, one for the fiber that reads

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|} \hline  & Lisbon & MSU \\ \hline algorithm & bundle divides “naturally” in sub-bundles & pre-defined sub-bundles \\ \# of curvatures & 2 & \(\geq\) 2, defined by algebra \\ curvature radii & \(\geq\)4.5 cm & 4.5 or 6 cm \\ fiber lengths & minimum & min. to min. + 23 cm \\ reproducibility & approximate & guaranteed by method \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 2: Routing parameters of the methods proposed by the Lisbon and the MSU groups.

the innermost tile of the cell ('long' fiber) and another for the fiber that reads the second tile and is shorter by the width of a tile ('short' fiber).

### The Lisbon proposal

In the Lisbon proposal the fiber lengths are the minimum compatible with cell to PMT path, keeping the curvature radius along the fibers above 4.5 cm. Fiber lengths may be increased by a few centimeters (\(<\)5) to reduce the number of different fiber lengths, and up to 10 cm to improve uniformity within some BC cells.

The number of curvatures is difficult to compute, because the fibers suffer a continuous curvature from the exit of the profiles to the bundle ring. That continuous curve may be decomposed in one curvature at the exit of the profiles plus another at the entrance of the bundle ring, so 2 curvatures are assigned to this method in table 2, even if the decomposition is quite forced. The curvature radius differ for the different fibers along the cell, but each fiber finishes with a curvature with radius in the range of 4.5 cm. Using this approach the fiber stress is the minimum possible compatible with the room available to rout the fiber within the girder. The fibers were bundled in one step in the barrel module, and by sub-bundles in the larger cells of extended barrel (mock-up studies). After the bundle is done, groups of fibers divide in sub-bundles "naturally", i.e., in the way in which the fibers tend to group with minimum stress and torsion. This allows the stress in the fibers to be the minimum compatible with the available room within the girder.

In principle, the reproducibility of the method is only approximate. The experience with the mock-up and Barrel Module 0 has shown that good reproducibility is well achieved with this method. If 'exact' reproducibility is required, a mapping of the sub-bundles can be prepared and used in the bundle making phase.

### The MSU proposal

In the MSU proposal the fibers of each cell are grouped in pre-defined sub-bundles and each sub-bundle is routed following a path with well defined curvatures. The path and curvatures are defined by an algebraic algorithm that combines 3 different kinds of pre-defined steps, resulting in a table with the steps to be followed by each sub-bundle.

The length of the fibers is computed by adding to the lengths of the straight paths the lengths of the pre-defined steps used. Compared with the minimal lengths required, it results in extra length per fiber up to 23 cm, increasing the total length of fibers required to the Tilecal by about 10% (100 Km). The extra length per fiber of 23 cm corresponds to a light loss of the order of 10%.

The number of curvatures is defined by the type and sequence of steps used, and is \(\geq\)2. The curvature radii are approximately constant with values of 4.5 and 6 cm. Each curvature in excess of the minimal value of 2 (as defined in the Lisbon method) results in extra stress to the fiber increasing the light loss with time that happens in fibers under stress.

The reproducibility of the routing is guaranteed by the method.

### Routing summary

The MSU scheme proposed by D. Shooltz _et al._[2] is very elegant. It is regular and easy to repeat, but it has 2 drawbacks. The first drawback is the excess length of 23 cm used in the fibers of many cells, resulting in a light loss of the order of 10% for those cells. The second one is the multiple bending of the fibers that results in extra stress and light loss, that may be negligible at short time, but can be an extra source of aging for the fibers. Preliminary results from the Barrel Module 0 show that our present light budget is not very generous, so our preference goes to the Lisbon method.

## 5 Final remarks

This comparative study was done in the beginning of 1997 in order to decide on the geometry and routing to be used in the Extended Barrel Module 0. This note summarizes the main topics involved and its draft version was part of the WWW based discussion on the optics of the 1997 modules ([http://atlasinfo.cern.ch/Atlas/SUB_DETECTORS/TILE/module0/extbm0/maio14-2-97.ps](http://atlasinfo.cern.ch/Atlas/SUB_DETECTORS/TILE/module0/extbm0/maio14-2-97.ps)).

The decision on the geometry was in favour of the "3-4-4" geometry for the extended barrel, and to keep the "3-6-2" in the barrel modules, based in the reasons presented above. For the Extended Barrel Modules 0, it was also decided to keep independent cells A16 and B15, as well as C9 and D5. The cells D8 and D9 were not used. The geometry of the Extended Barrel Modules 0 is shown in the right side of Fig. 2.

About the routing, it was decided to instrument the Argonne module using the MSU routing method, and the Barcelona module using the Lisbon method. The practical implementation of the MSU method was not so easy as foreseen. When compared with the Lisbon method, it was more difficult to make the alignment of the end of the fibers in the bundle tubes, and there was less freedom of the bundles during the gluing operations.

Preliminary results of light output showed that the light output of the Barcelona module is about 15 to 30% (depending on the cell) higher than the light output of the Argonne module. The origin of this difference is still being studied and cannot be justified only by the length of the fibers.
