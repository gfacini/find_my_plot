###### Abstract

We present the results of measurements of light output for several scintillator tiles produced by injection molding technique in Protvino in 1993 and 1994. In 1994 a polystyrene with better transparency has been used. The light output and uniformity response for several samples of each size were measured. Tiles produced in 1994 with new polystyrene show a small improvement in the attenuation length, but it is still below the attenuation length of Kuraray SCSN81 tiles machined in Bucharest. For a fixed tile size, tile to tile fluctuations in light output are of the order of about 3%. Masking was tried and it results in improvement of the uniformity but the light output decreases. When the tile grooves are cut, there is a big improvement in uniformity and the light output increases.

## 1 Introduction

The signal uniformity of the optical components (scintillating tiles) of the TILECAL calorimeter to be used in ATLAS, is being studied. The tile configuration for one calorimeter module is shown in fig. 1. There are several ways in which this optimization can be reached:

* Type of polystyrene and concentration of dopants.
* The tile geometrical shape.
* Injection and polishing conditions.
* Masking.

Several tiles were measured to reach an optimization in their light output and attenuation length. A new type of polystyrene with better transparency started to be used in the middle of the production for prototype module number 5, so several tiles of different productions were measured to check if there was an improvement in attenuation length and light output. Two geometries and two types of masking were studied: the standard geometry with grooves and a new one where the grooves were removed 1, masking with black painted scotch tape and masking with tedlar.

In section 2, the setup used is described, in section 3 it is described the measurement procedure. Section 4 describes the method of analysis used on the tiles measurement. In section 5 the results are shown and the response of the different types of tiles are compared: with standard configuration (Protvino 93 and 94 injection molding tiles, Kuraray tiles machined in Bucharest), the tiles without grooves and masking.

## 2 Setup

The scheme of the setup is in fig. 2. A collimated \({}^{90}\)Sr \(\beta\)-source moving in a X-Y table scans the tile along the central line in the X direction, with steps of 2 mm. The collimator diameter is 1 mm, and its distance to the tile is less than 2 mm, giving a spot diameter on the tile of approximately 2 mm. The tile is wrapped with white paper in the standard way used for the prototype modules, the fibers inside the grooves are covered with aluminized mylar. Later, in some of the tiles the grooves were cutted and the tiles were also measured in the same conditions, see fig. 3. For the masking studies, two tiles with standard configuration were wrapped with black strips, see fig. 4. The light output of each fiber is read by one PMT. The two independent signals are read by two voltmeters connected to a computer for data aquisition. The fibers are 1 m long BCF91A, aluminized at the side opposite to the PMT and polished in the other side. The optical contact tile-fiber is the fiber region between 88 and 98 cm far from the PMT.

## 3 Measurement procedure

Good stability and an acceptable signal to noise ratio is obtained, using XP2081B PMTs with a set of selected UA2 bases. The high voltage of the PMTs was adjusted to equalize the signals read at both sides of the reference tile. The signals of the PMTs are read by digital voltmeters. Each value read from the voltmeter is the average taken during 400 miliseconds. Noise is measured in the beginning of the scan, during the scan after every 4 cm scanned, and in the end of the scan. For each section of 4 cm, the subtracted noise point by point is the result of the linear interpolation of the noise measured at the beginning and at the end of the section. For all the scans of the \(\beta\)-source along the tile, the light output is measured 3 times. The final result is the average, point by point, of the 3 measurements. In this note are presented only scans along the central region of the tile. A transverse scan on a single fiber (without tile) was made, and the result can be seen in fig. 5. A gaussian fit gives \(\sigma=1.05mm\), i.e., \(FWHM=2.47mm\).

## 4 Analysis

Several regions can be identified in light output signal as function of the position of the \(\beta\)-source, \(I_{E}(\mathbf{x})\), see fig. 6: the fast slope region (A) going from 0 to 2 cm, region B from 2 cm to the start of the central bump, the central bump region and the region near the opposite fiber. The particular geometry of the tile, with the 2 central holes and the 2 injection points located near the center, contributes to the central bump. To characterize the tiles by the attenuation length the 2 regions A (\(L_{A}\)) and B (\(L_{B}\)) were used. In region B the contribution of the light reflected in the opposite side is very small and can be taken as a constant. So it is possible to fit the region dominatedby the longer attenuation with one exponential (see fig 7):

\[I_{B}(z)=I_{0B}\exp\left(-\frac{x}{L_{B}}\right) \tag{1}\]

This exponential is then subtracted to the data, and the fast slope region fitted also with a single exponential (see fig 8).

\[I_{A}(z)=I_{0A}\exp\left(-\frac{x}{L_{A}}\right) \tag{2}\]

In this note are also used the following parameters:

* Attenuation length of side one of the tile.
* Attenuation length of side two of the tile.
* \(I_{B1}(2cm)\) and \(I_{B2}(2cm)\)- Constant coefficient of the fit that gives the longer attenuation length at 2 cm from the fibers for side one and two, respectively.
* Light output at the center of the tile for fiber of side 1.
* Light output at the center of the tile for fiber of side 2.
* Total light output at the center of the tile.
* \(I_{E1}(2cm)\) and \(I_{B2}(2cm)\)- Light output at 2 cm from the fibers, for each side (experimental results, tables 1, 2, 3 and 7), to be compared with fit results \(I_{B1}(2cm)\) and \(I_{B2}(2cm)\) from tables 4, 5,6 and 8.
* Average value of total light output of both sides of the tile at 2 cm from the fibers, see fig 9.

To measure the non-uniformity (U shape) of the light output along the tile, the parameter \(R\) is used:

\[R=\left(1-\frac{I_{CT}}{<I_{TE}(2cm)>}\right)\times 100\% \tag{3}\]

In this way it is possible to quantify the increase in light output from the center of the tile to near the end, supressing the fast slope.

Results

Tiles with different sizes have been measured: new 1994 Protvino production (5 tiles of each size), old Protvino 93 production (2 or 3 tiles per size) and Bucharest (Kuraray SCSN81 machined scintillator - only 3 tiles, 2 with size #6 and 1 with size #10). In order to search for the optimization of the uniformity, in some of the tiles the grooves were removed, see fig. 3. The tiles were measured before and after the cut. Masking was used and compared with standard configuration. A tile size #10 was masked with 5 mm black painted scotch tape, see fig. 4 A and a tile size #6 was masked with 1 cm tedlar, see fig. 4 B.

The results were compiled in tables 1 to 6 for the tiles with grooves, in tables 7 and 8 for the tiles without grooves and in tables 9 to 12 for the masking.

* From tables 4, 5 and 6, we see that to an increase of the tile size corresponds a decrease in the longer attenuation length \(L_{B}\), except for the Bucharest/Kuraray tile size #10 and the two tiles size #18 from Protvino 93, which show an exceptionally large attenuation length, (tables 4 and 5), as well as light output (tables 1 and 2).
* Comparing the response of the tiles produced in Protvino in 93 (Pr93) in 94 (Pr94), and in Bucharest (Bu93), the attenuation length improved around 3 cm for tile sizes #10 and #14 from Pr93 to Pr94, neverthless it is well bellow the attenuation value for tile size #10 of Bu93, (\(L_{B}\)=45 cm).
* For tile size #6 there was an increase in attenuation length of about 5 cm between Protvino productions but is also bellow the value of the corresponding tile of Bu93 (\(L_{B}\)=30 cm).
* The shorter attenuation length \(L_{A}\) is independent of the tile size, because it is taken near the fibers. It varies a little with the quality of the polystyrene, aproximately 0.4 cm for Pr93, 0.6 cm for Pr94 and 0.8 cm for Bu93, showing that the slope near the fibers is slower for Bu93 tiles than for Pr93 and Pr94.
* From tables 1, 2 and 3, taking the total light output at the center of the-tile (\(I_{CT}\)), we see that, as expected, \(I_{CT}\) decreases with increase of tile size, except tile size #10 from Bucharest and tiles size #18 from Protvino 93, as was refered earlier.
* The non-uniformity \(R\) defined in eq. 3, increases with the tile size as expected. Comparing the two Protvino productions, we see an improvement of the uniformity of about 5% in tile size #14 and 2-3% in tile sizes #10 and #6.
* There is an increase in global light output of about 16% for tile size #14 and about 19% for tile sizes #10 and #6, between the two productions of Protvino, (figs. 6 and 9).

* Comparing the tiles (Pr94) with the standard configuration and the same tiles with grooves removed (tables 7 and 8), we see an increase of around 12 cm in attenuation length in region B, fig.-11. We also observe an increase in light output of about 20% along the tile except near the fibers, see fig. 12. This increase can be explained by a better optical quality of the surface in contact with the fiber.
* When the grooves are removed, the fast slope almost vanishes when compared with the standard configuration, fig. 12. The short attenuation length \(L_{A}\) increases (table 8). The shape with grooves enhances the light produced near the fibers. A very good improvement in the uniformity is achieved: the parameter \(R\) decreases from 14.7% to 6.5% for tile size #10 and from 8.5% to 0.9% for tile size #6, and the response of the tiles is almost flat as can be seen in figs. 12 and 13.
* The negative value of \(R\) in one (#2) of the tiles of size #6 is explained by the central bump which makes the light output in the center of the tile bigger than at a distance of 2 cm from the fibers.
* The masking with black painted scotch tape increased the attenuation length \(L_{B}\) by 5-6 cm, but there was a loss of about 27% in light output at the center of the tile. The non-uniformity R goes down from 15.7% to 6.5% (results from only one tile), see tables 9 and 10 and fig. 14.
* The masking with tedlar increased the attenuation length \(L_{B}\) by 1-4 cm, but there was a loss of about 6% in light output at the center of the tile. The non-uniformity R goes down from 7.4% to 5% (results from only one tile), see tables 11 and 12 and fig. 15.

## 6 Conclusions

The tiles of 1994 Protvino production show an improvement of 16-19% in light output compared with the 93 production, but the attenuation length improvement is very small. The tile to tile fluctuations are of the order of 3% for the measured samples. The short attenuation length near the ends of the tile is very much dependent on the geometry of the tile-fiber coupling. Masking gives better uniformity but at the expense of light output loss. The tiles without grooves show a much better uniformity, and higher light output. This new configuration of the tiles will improve the uniformity of TILECAL calorimeter. The production of the scintillating tiles can be still optimized, namely in what concerns the quality of the polystyrene used, and the quality of the tile surfaces.
