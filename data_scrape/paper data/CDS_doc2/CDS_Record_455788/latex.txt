**1-INTRODUCTION**

**Particle physics studies the fundamental constituents of matter and the interactions between them. This research requires high energies and large machines and has resulted in international collaboration. At the European Laboratory for Particle Physics, CERN, situated in Geneve, a network of accelerators has been developed. The largest accelerator is the electron-positron collider, LEP, which is 27 kilomet long.**

**The beams are smashed together in four large detectors, spaced round the ring (fig 1).**

LEP was ready for operations in 1989. Until then CERN only had the smaller rings, e.g. the Proton Synchrotron, PS and later the Super Proton Synchrotron, SPS. Both of them are now used to prepare beams for LEP.

**In addition to LEP's electron-positron collisions, CERN also supplies researches with proton and nuclear beams of both high and low energy and low antiproton beams. When LEP is operating, the PS and SPS can continue handling proton beams, interleaved with electrons and positrons destined for LEP. There is also a small ring for ions and low energy protons called PS booster, PSB and a low energy antiproton ring, LEAR. The whole hierarcy is schematically described in fig 2.**

**Figure 1: The particle beam network showing LEP and its detectors (dashed), the SPS ring and their injectors.**

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:4]

LEP work at the energy of 90 GeV and will be upgraded to about 200 GeV to be able to pair-produce W-bosons. It is believed that if the energy in center of mass = 1 TeV at parton level could be reached, this would imply a break through in particle physics. To reach that requires either a 1 TeV electron linear collider, or a proton collider at ~10 TeV center of mass energy. The major project of CERN in the coming decade is to build such a proton collider. This collider is called The Large Hadron Collider, LHC. It will be installed in the LEP tunnel on top of the existing magnet ring. The proton beams will each have an energy of 7 TeV. Also electron-proton and Pb-Pb collisions will be possible in this collider.

Figure 1.2: The CERN accelerators and, in the boxes, their detectors.

Cross sections for pointlike processes decrease like 1/E\({}^{2}\). However, the total pp cross section is slowly increasing with energy. At LHC the total cross section, \(\sigma\), will be \(\sim\) 10-25cm\({}^{2}\). Therefore a large number of pp collisions have to occur to have a small production of hard processes, i.e. the _luminosity_ needs to be very high (\(\sim\)10\({}^{34}\)cm-2\({}^{3}\)s-1). This is very demanding for detectors.

There are several groups at CERN, developing and constructing detectors for LHC. Two general purpose detectors are proposed to be installed at LHC so far, CMS and ATLAS. Tilecal, the instrument which I am going to present, is a part of ATLAS.

The conceptual layout of ATLAS is shown in fig 1.3 and 1.4. ATLAS consists, from inside and out, of the _inner tracking detector_, a superconducting solenoid, the _calorimeters_ - electromagnetic calorimeter and hadron calorimeter - and the _muon spectrometer_, which consists of air core toroids with muon chambers.

The detector gives us a reconstruction of a typical event like the simulated ones in fig 1.5 and fig 1.6.

The basic functions of the inner detector are precision momentum measurements of leptons, electron and photon identification at high luminosity and \(\tau\) and b tagging at lower luminosities.

The _em_ barrel calorimeter measures the energy of the electrons and photons. The technique is based on spaced thin lead absorbers with liquid argon as read out media.

The barrel sampling hadron calorimeter is made of iron and _scintillator tiles_, with "longitudinal" tile configuration. This is the tile calorimeter,_Tilecal_.

For the developement of the calorimeter a small prototype was constructed and put in a _testbeam_ created in the proton synchroton, SPS. When the primary protons collide with a target they create many various particles. Momentum slices of these are selected to secondary beams which are guided to the test set-up. The particles are identified as pions, electrons or muons. This makes it possible to study the performance of the calorimeter. For the understanding the results are then compared with _Monte Carlo simulations_.

The first chapter of this paper is a presentation of the physics motivation for LHC and the role of the calorimeter. Then I describe the mechanics of Tilecal and the physics required for testbeam setup and analyses.

The main part is concern the calibration of a prototype of the scintillator tile hadron calorimeter, in which I was taking part during my 20 week stay at CERN.

**2-FUTURE PHYSICS AT LHC**

**2.1 Introduction**

The _Standard Model_ explains the fundamental physics with _fermions_ ("matter particles") and _bosons_ (force mediators). The fermions are the _quarks_ and _leptons_ from which all matter is composed. They are grouped in three families as shown in table 2.1

All the fermions, except the top quark and the \(\tau\)-neutrino, are discovered.

The interactions among the fermions, the strong, the electromagnetic and the weak forces, are described by the Gauge theories. There is also a fourth force, the gravitation, but it is too weak to be of concern at energies available in laboratory experiments.

The electromagnetic and weak forces are described together as the electroweak force.

The mediators of the strong and electroweak forces are the spin-1 vector _gauge bosons_. They are quantizations of the force _fields_. The bosons of the electro-weak field are the massive W+, W- and Z and the massless photon, \(\gamma\). The mediators of the strong force is the massless _coloured_ gluons. Colour is the "charge" of a strongly interacting particle. There are three colours and eight gluons. The strong interaction is described by the QCD (Quantum Chromo Dynamics)

The Gauge theories of the forces are based on gauge _symmetries_, SU(2) x U(1) for electroweak interactions and SU(3) for strong interactions. The symmetry principle predicts a field with spin-1 and zero mass, but the bosons W+, Z are very heavy because the symmetry is _broken_ by a vacuum field with the _Higgs boson_ as field particle. This description is called the Standard Model, SM.

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|} \hline  & & & \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 2.1: Periodic table of the fermions. The particles within the dashed box interact with the electromagnetic force. The quarks (in the black box) interact also with the strong force.

Table 2.2 contains the masses of all the fermions and bosons. The masses of the neutrinos are not determined but are very small. From LEP we know that the mass of the top-quark is above 113 GeV. The masses of W and Z and the top constrain the mass of the Higgs to lie within the range 7GeV - 1TeV. Experiments at LEP have put a lower limit of \(\sim\)60 GeV.

The LHC will explore a mass region up to 1 TeV. A major goal is to find evidences for

* the Higgs boson
* the top quark

There could also be other discoveries like

* additional vector bosons, Z', W'
* supersymmetry (SUSY) particles (e g gluinos, squarks, charged Higgs)
* quark compositness
* hybrid forms of matter (lepton-quarks, excited leptons)

\begin{table} \end{table}
Table 2.2: The fermions and bosons in the SM, their charge, spin and masses.

**2.2 Search for the Higgs Boson**

Experimental searches for the Higgs in the Minimal SM must take into account:

* production mechanism
* decay pattern, that give a signal to detect.

**2.2.1 Production**

The Higgs production at LHC are of two kinds:

* Gluon fusion (see fig 2.1)

This amplitude is large if the mass of the top is large.
* The amplitude of the W/Z fusion in fig 2.2 is larger than of the gluon fusion if m\({}_{\rm H}\) > 600 GeV

**Fig 2.2** W/Z fusion

#### 2.2.2 Detection

The possible searches for the Higgs boson depends on the mass.

- 80 < \(m_{H}\)< 130 GeV

The best channel to observe a possible signal from the Higgs boson production at LHC in this mass range is the decay

\[H\mbox{--}\ \gamma\gamma \tag{1}\]

The feasability to detect a signal depends on the _branching ratio_ and the _background_.

This signal has a small branching ratio but it does not suffer from the big Z background that will be produced at LHC.

The observation of the signal requires good electromagnetic calorimeter resolution and very efficient rejection of jet backgrounds, in particular of isolated \(\pi^{0}\)s, which may simulate isolated photon signatures. In addition an accurate measurement of the photon directions with the calorimeter is needed in order to achieve the desired mass resolution, i.e. to be able to see a signal superimposed on a large background.

- 120 < \(m_{H}\)< 180

In this mass range, the most promising mode is

\[H\mbox{--}\ \mbox{$ZZ^{*}$--}\ \mbox{$llll$}\ \ \ \ \ \mbox{(four leptons)} \tag{2}\]

- 180 < \(m_{H}\)< 800

In this mass range, the Higgs is expected to decay to

\[H\mbox{--}\ \mbox{$W^{+}W^{-}$} \tag{3}\]

and

\[H\mbox{--}\ \mbox{$ZZ$} \tag{4}\]

The most promising one is \(H\mbox{--}\ \mbox{$ZZ\mbox{--}\ \mbox{$llll$}}\).

The observation of a possible Higgs signal in this channel depends mostly on the luminosity, because the background (from tt events) can be considerably reduced after kinematic cuts.

With jets in the final state, the modes 2.3. and 2.4 give a limited detection of the Higgs due to the enormous QCD background levels.

For Higgs masses larger than the reach accessible by the 4 lepton channel, the channel \(H\)--\(>ZZ\)--\(>llv\),\(v\) may be considered. The rate is 6 times larger but the decay cannot be fully reconstructed due to the noninteracting neutrinos. The detectors must be good enough to reduce the \(Z^{+}\) jets background to a negligible level.
* \(m_{H}\) = 1 TeV In the TeV region the usually exploited decays are \(H\)--\(>\)\(WW\)--\(>\)\(l\)\(v\)\(jj\) (2.5) (lepton, neutrino and two high energy quark jets). And \(H\)--\(>ZZ\)--\(>\)\(lljj\) (2.6) The branching ratios is larger than for the leptonic modes but also the background rates. Detection of the scattered quarks, marked q in fig 2.2 is expected to considerably improve the significance of a possible Higgs mass signal.

**2.3 Top Quark Physics**

The most probable value of \(m_{t}\) ranges from 132-150 GeV, depending on \(m_{H}\) and it is observed from radiative effects on the \(Z^{0}\) line shape that it cannot be much larger than 200 GeV. Some important goals of LHC are precise measurements of \(m_{t}\) and studies of top-quark decays.

There will be copius production of \(\rm{t\overline{t}}\) events at LHC. Purely hadronic final states from \(\rm{t\overline{t}}\) production are swamped by QCD multijet backgrounds. for the measurement of \(m_{t}\), the interesting final states are those containing at least one high-\(\rm{p_{T}}\) isolated charged lepton, which will allow a rather clean tagging of \(\rm{t\overline{t}}\) events.

The standard top-quark decay is

\[\rm{t\ \mbox{--}\ >\ }bW \tag{2.7}\]

In extension of the Standard Model with charged Higgs bosons, \(\rm{H^{+}}\), as for example in the MSSM (Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model), the decay could, if kinematically allowed, be completed with

\[\rm{t\mbox{--}\ >\ }bH^{+} \tag{2.8}\]

The \(\rm{H^{+}}\) then decays to \(\rm{\tau\nu_{t}}\) or \(\rm{cs}\).

**2.4 Search for New Vector Bosons**

A heavy \(Z\)' is searched for in two channels. One is a decay in two leptons (e\({}^{+}\)e\({}^{-}\) or \(\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\)). The other channel is a decay in two jets. This requires good resolution of the calorimeters.

**2.5 Search for Quark Substructure**

QCD 2-jets events with very large transverse momentum (\(\rm p_{T}\)) will be a dominant feature of hard collisions at the LHC. The hypothesis of a parton substructure can be tested by measuring the cross section of _inclusive jets_. A composite nature of the quarks would show up as deviations from the standard QCD expectations at high \(\rm p_{T}\), where valence quark scattering dominates. Fig 2.3 shows the deviations of the cross section from QCD for different values of the compositeness scale, \(\Lambda_{C}\)[8].

**Fig 2.3 Deviation from QCD for different \(\Lambda_{C}\) values. The dashed lines show the effect of possible systematics error.**

When measuring the cross section at high \(\rm p_{T}\) it is important to minimize the uncertainties in the knowledge of the calorimeter linearity and in the resolution behaviour (non-Gaussian tales).

### Summary

The QCD 2-jet events with very large \(\rm{PT}\) will constitute one of the major sources of background to new signatures, so it is crucial to understand them well.

The hadron calorimeter will be an essential part for the detection of jets at the high energies of LHC.

The study of the physics accessible at LHC has led to the following criteria for the ATLAS calorimetry:

* good electromagnetic calorimetry for the identification measurement of photons and electrons in the energy range from 7-10 GeV up to a few TeV;
* hermetic jet and missing transverse energy measurements;
* ability to operate and trigger at luminosities in excess of \(10^{34}\) cm-\({}^{2}\)s-1;
* ability to tolerate the radiation level accumulated during at least 10 years of operation.

The requirements of the energy resolution are

\[\begin{array}{l}\sigma=\frac{50\%}{\rm{E}}+3\%\\ \end{array} \tag{9}\]

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:18]

For approximately total absorption (95% at 100 GeV), a detector length L of - 21 X0 is required for an electromagnetic calorimeter and L \(\sim\) 6 \(\lambda_{0}\) for a hadron calorimeter.

The nuclear absorption length is always much larger than the radiation length, which means that hadron calorimeters have to be much longer than electromagnetic calorimeters. A _sampling calorimeter_ measures only a fraction of the deposited energy. It consists of passive absorber plates of iron, which are interleaved with active detectors (fig 3.2).

Most of the secondary shower will get out of the absorber plates and may thus be detected. But an additional error \(\Delta\)E will result from sampling fluctuations.

The uncertainty in the energy measurement, \(\Delta\)E, is proportional to the statistical fluctuations, \(\Delta\)N, and since \(\Delta\)N/N \(\sim\) 1/\(\sqrt{\rm N}\), the energy resolution improves with energy as:

Figure 3.2: The hadronic shower

Figure 3.3: The Sampling technique

The fragmentations of nuclei means binding energy losses and production of heavy fragments with short range. In addition, muons and neutrinos may escape without detection. Thus, a substantial fraction (20-40%) of the absorbed energy will remain invisible. This will cause a further degradation of the energy resolution in hadron calorimeters.

The large and strongly variable fraction of invisible energy loss results in a response _electron/hadron_\(\neq\)1 (called e/h ratio), i.e. the calorimeter produces different signals for em and hadronic particles with the same incident energy. In a nuclear reaction equal quantities of \(\pi^{+},\pi^{-}\) and \(\pi^{0}\) are created. The \(\pi^{0}\) particles decay in two \(\gamma\) and do not contribute further to shower developments. Therefore, the response is very sensitive to the fluctuations in the primary shower, that increases very slowly with the energy. The consequenses of this is a non-linear energy response, because the em fraction, \(f_{em}\), increases very slowly with energy, and a deterioration of the energy resolution by a constant term. Also, the distribution of the monoenergetic hadrons will not be a Gaussian. There will be a _high energy tail_, descending from the em (\(\pi^{0}\)) part.

The ratio e/\(\pi\) is the electromagnetic part of the total energy. If the ratio e/\(\pi\) is measured in a testbeam, the e/h ratio can be calculated through the relation

\[\mbox{e/$\pi$(E)}=\frac{\mbox{e}}{\mbox{$<f_{em}>$}+(1-\mbox{$<f_{em}>$})h}= \frac{\mbox{e/h}}{\mbox{1 - (e/h - 1)0.11lnE}} \tag{3.4}\]

Other fluctuations like the length the hadron travels before it starts the shower also contribute to the energy independent term of the resolution.

The dark current adds with a term proportional to 1/E.

At high energies the energy dependent terms will be very small and the constant term will be a dominant feature. Thus, good longitudinal containment is much more important for energy resolution than transverse containment.

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:21]

The scintillator tiles traverse the width of the sector modules, and all WLSfibers are accessible from the side faces of each module. Fibers from different tiles are then grouped together to form effective read-out cells.

The calorimeter will have a threefold longitudinal segmentation (pseudo-towers). Together with the three segments of the em calorimeter there are a sixfold segmentation to detect the hadrons. The two first longitudinal compartments will have the granularity 0.1 in \(\eta\) but the last one, which will act mostly as a tail catcher will have the double granularity and also be much longer. The first segment will be the smallest, to be able to detect em particles not contained in the em calorimeter. Both \(\omega\)-edges of a given cell are read out independently. The total number of channels is \(\sim\) 10000.

The active depth of the modules in radial direction is \(\sim\)153 cm. This corresponds to 7.5 interaction lengths at \(\eta\) = 0, since \(\lambda_{0}\) = 20.5 cm in the tiles/iron. The em compartment in front will contribute with 2 additional interaction lengths.

Figure 4.3: Staggering of tiles in a module (shematic, not to scale).

Figure 4.1: 3-D view of the hadron calorimeter in ATLAS at LHC.

### Prototype Modules

Three testmodules, weighing 3.5 tons and with the length reduced from 5.8m to 1m have been constructed and exposed to the SPS beam. Modules in test beam give, in addition to the possibility of measuring their performance, experience in the construction and the assembly of the iron and the scintillator tiles. One of the particle types electrons, negative pions or muons with a certain energy are selected in the secondary beam.

Since the modules are put in test beam without any em calorimeter in front, these modules are a bit deeper than those planned for ATLAS to be able to contain the whole shower of the hadrons. Instead of three longitudinal segments they contain four and all with the same width. The segments are named depth 1, 2, 3 and 4. Depth 1, which is the one closest to the beam, contains three tiles in the longitudinal direction. The others contain respectively four, five and six tiles. Each tile have the hight of 10 cm and the total depth is 180 cm, to be compared with 153 cm as planned for ATLAS.

In the z-direction, the modules are divided in five 'rows'. The two outer rows contain 12 tiles in the z-direction and the others 11 tiles. In total there are 4*5=20 read-out _cells_ per module. All the tiles in one cell are read out by the same PM's.

Every cell is read out by two PM's, one for the 'left' side of the tiles and the other for the 'right' side. The PM' s are named like in the schematic figure 4.4.

Figure 4.4: A schematic picture of a testmodule, with the identification of the PM’s as numbers written in the center of the cells.

The 3 mm thick tiles are seperated by 6 mm of iron.

In direction of the depths the tiles are staggered alternately as shown in fig 4.5.

The tiles are made of polystyrene based plastic marerial. WLS-fibers of type Bicron BCF91A and 10 stage Photomultipliers (Philips) are used for the readout.

### The Test Beam Set-up

The muons, electrons and negative pions used in test beam are selected from a jet, produced by protons hitting a target of beryllium (or, as in our case, the cheaper material polyethen). The target must have a long X\({}_{0}\), to not stop too many \(\pi^{0}\) (with electromagnetic behaviour). The selected beam then passes through _bending magnets_, _quadropoles_, _collimators_, _scintillation counters_ and _beam chambers_ before it enters to the calorimeter modules. Fig 4.6 is a schematic picture of the beamline setup. When the muon beam is selected, a big absorber wall of iron is placed in the beam to absorb all other particles.

Figure 4.6: The beamline setup in the Tilecal experiment (beam direction from right to left).

Figure 4.5: A closer look at the tile/iron configuration.

The magnets are used to define the momentum. The quadropoles focus the beam and the collimators define the size of the beam.

The electronic system in a test beam set-up is divided in three blocks as in fig 4.7. The blocks are the detector, the read-out and the computer.

The PM's in the detector converts the light from the fibres to current. The energy is proportional to

\[Q=\int_{gate}i\ dt \tag{4.1}\]

The gate is a time interval of 350ns on which data is taken. The trigger opens the gate, so in each gate there is a particle (of about 40ns). The ADC digitizes the analog signal.

Figure 4.7: The electronic system in the Tilecal experiment.

The trigger signal comes from the scintillation counters S1, S2, S3. The coincidence S1 * S2 ensures a true beam particle. The coincidence S1 * S2 * S3 selects a specific region in space.

The counters also identify eventual _double hits_, i.e. two particles entering the calorimeter at the same time.

With the _beam chambers_ it is possible to determine the position in space with higher precision. They are also useful to reject double hits and, since there are two chambers, to check the direction of the beam.

The beam chambers detect the position of the particle by measurments of time delays. It consists of a network of wires in a gas like in fig 4.8. Four signals come from the chamber, two of them with the information of the position in x and the other two of the position in y.

When a charged particle passes the chamber it ionize the gas and activates the nearest wire in x and y directions.

The clock that measures the time starts when the trigger comes and stops when the signal reaches the end of the wire. The TDC digitizes the time.

The wire is read out in both ends as in fig 4.8. The delay time difference between the left and right end holds information about which wire was hit. Double hits are removed by asking the sum \(X_{\mbox{left}}+X_{\mbox{right}}\) to be equal to a constant.

### 4.4 Tilecal Performance

Data from the modules in test beam has been analyzed.

A look at the energy deposited as a function of z reveals a period of 18 mm or half a period of 9 mm with higher signal in positrons right under a tile and a smaller maximum for every second tile (fig 4.9).

Figure 4.8: The basics of a delay time chamber. The wires that are activated by the particle are dark in the picture.

The energy resolution of the tile calorimeter has been measured with negative pions ranging from 20 GeV to 300 GeV. The observed resolution is parametrized by (fig 4.10):

\[\frac{\mbox{s}}{\mbox{E}}=\frac{47\%}{\mbox{\ae}}+2.3\% \tag{4.2}\]

Figure 4.10: Tile calorimeter energy resolution for hadrons at different incident angels without the em section in front.

Figure 4.9: z-scan with 20 GeV electrons at \(0^{0}\), revealing the configuration of the tiles.

This result satisfies well the ATLAS requirement.

Tilecal performs well also in other aspects:

-The intrinsic \(e/\pi\) response ratio of this iron based calorimeter is 1.2 at 20 GeV.

-The calorimeter also responds well to muons. A negligible angular dependence has been measured.

-The signal-to-noice ratio at LHC is expected to be 6.5. The signal to noice ratio is determined with muons that are considered as minimum ionizing particles.

-In 10 years of running at peak luminosity the innermost calorimeter layer will be exposed to an integrated dose of \(\sim\)350 Gy. During these years, the light output reduction will be less than 5%. The reduction decreases exponentially towards the outside.

## 5 Calibration of the Testmodules

### 5.1 Introduction.

There are two issues of the calibration, the cell to cell intercalibration, which I will present here, and the overall energy scale, the absolute calibration.

Absolute energy calibration will be done in the testbeam with the tile calorimeter positioned behind electromagnetic modules.

The calorimeter system consists of the hadron calorimeter, the light readout and the electronics (fig 5.1).

The gains of the electronics can be seperatly monitored and calibrated with a pulser.

The light mixer and the PM's are monitored by a laser-driven light pulse system, described in the next chapter.

Figure 5.1: A schematic picture of the calorimeter systemThe tiles and fibres are controlled and precalibrated with a \({}^{137}\)Cs moveable source. The final software calibration will be produced by the source. The calibration is crosschecked with the three types of particles (\(\mu\), \(\pi^{-}\), e-) from the testbeam. Calibration constants are obtained for them all. The methods and results for each of them as well as the correlation with cesium will be presented. In ATLAS the calibration will only be crosschecked with one kind of particle. This comparision of the particles could tell us which one to use. Muons are preferable since their calorimeter response is simpler to interpret.

Many of the results in this chapter are presented as a value on \(\sigma\), which refer to the RMS of a gaussian distribution.

### Laser monitoring

The goal of the laser is to have a fast system to control and monitor the gain and the linearity of the light readout from the PM's and the light mixer in the short term.

The light pulses from the laser illuminates every cell through an optical fibre (fig 5.2). A train of four electronic pulses is sent to the laser that thus sends four flashes. Fibres lead also to two reference diods.
