# Constraining the dark sector with the monojet signature in the ATLAS experiment

The ATLAS Collaboration

This note presents the reinterpretation of the search for final states with at least one energetic jet and missing transverse momentum in the context of dark sector models with long-lived non-charged particles. Results are based on 139 fb\({}^{-1}\)of data collected in \(pp\) collisions at \(\sqrt{s}=13\,\)TeV by the ATLAS experiment during Run-2 at LHC. The RECAST software framework is used in this context to probe two different new physics scenarios. Decays of the Standard Model Higgs boson and of a new neutral heavy scalar mediator into long-lived particles are investigated in different channels. The resulting constraints generally extend those from dedicated searches at large proper lifetimes.

## 1 Introduction

Final states with large missing transverse momentum, \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\), recoiling against at least one high energetic jet are a striking signature, which offers a unique probe to search for beyond the Standard Model processes that include extremely feebly- or non-interacting particles, leading to \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\) in the final states.

In this note the monojet search based on the entire dataset collected by the ATLAS experiment during Run-2 at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) [1] is considered. The high precision estimation of the background processes, dominated by V+jets production, is achieved through a simultaneous likelihood fit exploiting the shape of the distributions of the total transverse momentum of the particles recoiling against hadrons. A set of orthogonal control regions allow to reduce the total backgrounds uncertainty to the percent level, thus enhancing the sensitivity to new physics signals.

Several extensions of the Standard Model (SM) predict a complex spectrum of new particles [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], which can constitute a new dark sector. Such theories predict the Higgs boson as a possible portal to new physics. Indeed, undiscovered decay modes of the Higgs boson into non-SM particles are allowed, being the current limits on its invisible branching fraction still sizeable (\(\mathcal{B}(H\to\mathrm{inv})<11\%\) @95% CL [8]). In this work, the models which introduce a long-lived dark photon or a neutral scalar as a mediator interacting with the Higgs and dark sector particles are considered. The mediator of these interactions might be identified by looking for the production of SM fermions in displaced vertices, originating signatures which are probed by dedicated ATLAS searches [9, 10, 11, 12].

The monojet search is here reinterpreted in terms of simplified benchmark signatures to infer constraints on a wider spectrum of dark sector scenarios. When considering LLPs, if their lifetime is long enough, they might escape the ATLAS detector before decaying, yielding \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\). If those particles are produced in association with initial-state-radiation (ISR), a monojet final state is obtained. This event topology might be produced also if LLPs decay products are either reconstructed as jets, or are soft leptons which, being produced in displaced decay vertices, are not properly identified and reconstructed in the final state.

Hence, the monojet search is expected to be sensitive mainly to long-lived particles with very long lifetimes, with reduced exclusion power for almost prompt decays.

The results shown in this note have been obtained using the RECAST (Request Efficiency Computation for Alternative Signal Theories) framework [13]. This allows to use the background predictions of the original analysis [1] to test new physics models, and to include systematic detector-related uncertainties for the signal samples.

The note is organised as follows. Section 2 describes the theory models investigated and includes a summary of the parameters chosen for the simulation of the signal Monte Carlo (MC) samples. In Section 3 the main aspects of the monojet analysis of Ref. [1], as well as the fit strategy, are described. Finally, the results of the reinterpretation are shown in Section 4, along with a comparison to the results of previous ATLAS searches.

## 2 Description of the signal models

The theoretical scenarios probed in the note are described in this Section. The Falkowski Ruderman Volansky Zupan model [14; 15], predicting the production of dark photons from the Higgs boson, is addressed in Section 2.1. Section 2.2 describes the phenomenology foreseen from a minimal extension of the SM where a single additional scalar field is included. A summary of the set of free parameters of the model chosen for the signal simulation is also provided.

The generated events are processed through a full simulation of the ATLAS detector geometry and response [16] using the Geant4 [17] toolkit. The effect of additional nearby proton-proton collisions within the same proton bunches (pile-up) is taken into account by overlaying events simulated using Pythia8.186 [18] with the A3 tune [19] and the NNPDF2.3lo set of parton distribution functions (PDF) [20].

Simulated events are processed through the same reconstruction software as the data recorded by the ATLAS experiment. Moreover, corrections are applied to the simulated events so that the particle candidates' selection efficiencies, energy scales and energy resolutions match those determined from data control samples.

### Falkowski Ruderman Volansky Zupan model

The existence of a dark sector of particles coupled to SM via the addition of kinetic mixing terms to the Lagrangian is addressed in several works [21; 22; 23; 24]. This note focuses on a process predicted in the FRVZ model [14; 15], which is schematically represented in Figure 1. It foresees that the Higgs boson, or a heavier scalar particle, can decay into a pair of dark fermions. These particles in turn produce cascade decays to lighter hidden states, which go undetected and produce \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\) in the final states, and light long-lived dark photons (\(\gamma_{d}\)). The dark photons, assumed to be massive, kinetically mix with the SM photon via an interaction governed by the coupling parameter \(\varepsilon\). The off-shell photons then decay to pairs of fermions or light hadrons, producing displaced vertices. The smaller the \(\varepsilon\) value, the more displaced the vertex of the photon decay from the interaction point: if the proper lifetime of the \(\gamma_{d}\) (\(c\tau_{d}\)) is long enough, or the system is boosted by initial-state-radiation (ISR), the \(\gamma_{d}\) decay products may not be reconstructed within the ATLAS detector, leading to a monojet signature. In this process, emission of additional dark sector radiation [25], determined by the dark gauge coupling, can in principle lead to a multiple \(\gamma_{d}\) production in the final state. In the FRVZ model this parameter is assumed to be negligible, thus such contributions are neglected and only final states with two dark photons are considered.

ATLAS dark photon searches are typically divided into two categories, optimised for different ranges of the kinetic mixing parameter \(\varepsilon\), thus of the lifetime of the \(\gamma_{d}\)[26; 27]. Scenarios with \(\varepsilon>10^{-5}\) are probed by prompt searches [28], while dedicated displaced dark-photon-jet searches, like the one in Ref. [9], target the phase space with \(\varepsilon<10^{-5}\), i.e., with large \(\gamma_{d}\) proper lifetimes. The latter range is also targeted by the monojet analysis, though sensitivity at lower lifetimes is also expected if the decay products of the \(\gamma_{d}\) are not properly identified.

The \(\gamma_{d}\) mass is assumed to be within the range of [0.2, 2] GeV, in order to explore a mass interval comparable with the one probed by dedicated searches; therefore the resulting off-mass-shell SM photon will decay either into electron or muon pairs, or into light hadrons for \(m_{\gamma_{d}}>2m_{\pi}\). A detailed description of the branching fraction as a function of the \(\gamma_{d}\) mass can be found in Ref. [14]. The impact of the different decay modes on the sensitivity of the search is discussed in Section 4.

Alternative scenarios foresee an heavier neutral scalar particle, referred to as \(H^{\prime}\) in the following, initiating the decay chain of the FRVZ model. In this note, the case where \(m_{H^{\prime}}=800\) GeV and the mass of the \(\gamma_{d}\) is set to \(400\) MeV is considered. Results on this model are also derived and compared to the one reported in Ref. [9].

Table 1 summarises the parameter values of the FRVZ benchmark model with the SM Higgs (Model 1), or a heavier scalar particle (Model 2), which are generated and simulated, as described later in this section. As already mentioned, different values of the mass of the \(\gamma_{d}\) are considered in Model 1 by rescaling the events by the ratio of the branching fractions to different final states. These are set assuming to have the same signal acceptance varying the \(\gamma_{d}\) mass hypothesis in the range probed. The benchmark values of \(c\tau_{d}\) of the simulated events for both models are chosen in order to maximise the acceptance of the dedicated ATLAS analyses. In the model including

a heavier scalar particle, a lower value of proper lifetime is needed to get similar decay vertex displacements, as the boost of the dark photons is kinematically enhanced being \(m_{H^{\prime}}>m_{H}\). However, it is possible to combine the available samples to obtain a new one corresponding to a chosen lifetime via a re-weighting technique already adopted by the dedicated search [9]. This allows to derive alternative signals with different lifetimes, which are used in the fit procedure.

Events for both Model 1 and Model 2 are generated at leading-order (LO) in QCD using the MadGraph5_aMC@NLO v2.6.2 generator [29], using Pythia8.212 [18] for parton showering. Only the gluon-gluon fusion production of the SM Higgs boson is considered, and the assumed cross-section, \(\sigma=48.61\,\mathrm{pb}^{+2.08\,\mathrm{pb}}_{-3.15\,\mathrm{pb}}\) (theory) \(\pm\) 0.89 pb (PDF) \({}^{+1.24\,\mathrm{pb}}_{-1.26\,\mathrm{pb}}\) (\(\alpha_{s}\)), is calculated at next-to-next-to-leading order (N\({}^{3}\)LO) in QCD and next-to-leading order (NLO) in EW accuracy, as reported in Ref. [30].

### Higgs decays into long-lived scalar particles

Decays of the Higgs boson to particles with macroscopic mean proper lifetimes can be described by simplified models involving a single additional BSM scalar particle (\(s\)) [25; 31; 32]. The latter can produce displaced vertices decays in the ATLAS detector, decaying in a pair of SM fermions as represented in Figure 2. A Yukawa-like interaction between the Higgs boson, the \(s\) particles and their decay products is assumed. As in the case of the FRVZ model, if the Higgs boson is produced in association with an ISR jet and the lifetime of its decay products, the scalar particles \(s\), is sufficiently long, the final state results in a monojet topology.

Masses of the \(s\) scalar boson of 5 GeV, 35 GeV and 55 GeV are considered, with lifetimes \(c\tau_{s}\) ranging between a few cm and 5.5 m. As for the FRVZ model, only the gluon-gluon fusion production mode of the Higgs boson is considered, and the events are normalised to the cross-section at the same level of accuracy of N\({}^{3}\)LO in QCD and NLO in EW.

MC samples are generated with MadGraph5_aMC@NLO v2.6.2 [29] at LO, interfaced with Pythia8.230 [33] using the A14 tune of parameters [34], with the NNPDF2.3lo PDF set [35]. Details on the parameters used in the event generation are shown in Table 2. Also in this case, the \(c\tau_{s}\) values of the simulated samples are tuned to maximise the acceptance of the ATLAS dedicated

searches. A lifetime re-weighting of the events is performed therefore to produce signals in order to scan different lifetime regimes of the BSM scalar particles.

### Higher order re-weighting of signal samples

A key element of the monojet search is the usage of a fit exploiting the shape of the \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\) distribution for the background estimation and for the signal interpretation. In the boosted regimes explored in the analysis the predictions based on the LO and NLO QCD calculations of the gluon-gluon fusion production process lead to differences greater than 50% in the jet \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) distributions. For this reason, signals which foresee the production of LLPs in the decay of the SM Higgs boson are corrected in order to match the NLO QCD accuracy available for the \(gg\to H\to\mathrm{inv}\) process investigated in the dedicated monojet search [1]. An event re-weighting based on the truth \(p_{T}(\mathrm{H})\) is applied, such that the particle level distribution obtained in the LO QCD samples matches the distribution predicted at NLO. After such correction, for large enough lifetimes, the \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\) distributions of the FRVZ and \(H\to ss\) models are found to be consistent with the one of the \(gg\to H\to\mathrm{inv}\) process, as expected.

## 3 Mono-jet search

In this section the main aspects of the monojet search based on the full Run-2 dataset collected with the ATLAS experiment are addressed. The simulation of the background processes, the object reconstruction and event selection adopted here are the same as in Ref. [1]. An overview of the event selection is summarised below, although further details on the analysis strategy are provided in the reference.

As already mentioned above, the analysis adopts precise V+jets predictions to constrain the irreducible \(Z(\to\nu\nu)\) + jets background normalisation by introducing high-statistics CR including leptons, enriched in \(W\) and \(Z\)+jets processes. The definition of the CR used in the fit and a summary of the description of the likelihood model adopted are included in this section. The impact of the systematic uncertainties on the signal models considered are discussed below. The full details of the systematic uncertainties affecting the background predictions are discussed in Ref. [1].

\begin{tabular}{c c c} \hline \(m_{\mathrm{H}}\) GeV & \(m_{s}\) [GeV] & \(c\tau_{s}\) [mm] \\ \hline

125 & 55 & 1050, 5320 \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}

### Event selection and analysis region definition

Events in data are selected using calorimeter based \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\) triggers, which are measured to be fully efficient above 200. Additional single electron triggers are used to select events which populate the CR defined below.

Both data and MC simulated events are required to have a primary vertex with at least two tracks. Events are selected with \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}>200\). Up to four jets with \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) > 30 and \(|\eta|\)< 2.8 are allowed in the final state. An additional cut to suppress pile-up contributions is applied on the Jet Vertex Tagger score [36], and quality requirements on the jet energy deposits in the calorimeters are requested to suppress non-collision backgrounds. The selection criteria of \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) > 150 and \(|\eta|\)< 2.4 are applied on the leading jet. To ensure a genuine \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\), events are requested to have the angular separation between the missing transverse momentum direction and any jet in the event of \(\mathrm{min}|\Delta\phi(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\), jet\()|\) > 0.4; this requirement is tightened at 0.6 when \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\) < 250 to further suppress the contribution of the QCD multi-jet background.

The signal region (SR) is then defined by vetoing events with reconstructed leptons or photons. The residual background is dominated by the \(Z(\rightarrow\nu\nu)\) + jets process, followed by \(W\)+jets, where \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\) originates from the missing reconstruction of final state leptons (electrons, muons and taus), while smaller contributions come from top quark related processes and dibosons production. At low \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\) values, the multi-jet and non-collision backgrounds sharply increase, though the latter has a negligible contribution overall; both these components are estimated via pure data-driven techniques, as described in the dedicated paper. The SM backgrounds are normalised to data in orthogonal regions via a simultaneous shape fit which exploits the distribution of the total transverse momentum recoiling against hadronic activity in the events, \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{recoil}}\), as described in Section 3.2.

Two orthogonal CR enriched in \(W\)+jets events are defined by requiring exactly one reconstructed electron or muon. An additional requirement on the transverse mass of the lepton-\(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\) system is applied and events with \(b\)-tagged jets are rejected. As mentioned, top-quark related processes are a sub-leading component in the total background in the signal region (\(\sim\)4%), however an additional CR enriched in these events is defined by inverting the \(b\)-jet veto. This is done in order to constrain the large theoretical uncertainties affecting the MC predictions and, at the same time, to have a data-driven estimate of the normalisation of such contributions. To maximise the statistical power of this CR, the two lepton flavours are merged. Two additional two-leptons CR are defined by requiring exactly two electrons or muons with an invariant mass within a window of \(\pm\)25 around the \(Z\) pole. In order to emulate the kinematic distribution of the \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\) in the SR, all the selected leptons in the CR are considered as being invisible particles. Hence, their transverse momentum is summed to the \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\) measured in the event to build the total \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{recoil}}\) of the event against hadronic jets. Finally, the same requirement applied in the SR on the angular distance between \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\) and any jet in the event is applied in each CR by considering the vector components of \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{recoil}}\) in the transverse plane. The contribution of the signal models considered to the CR is checked to be negligible.

In Figure 3 the total SM background distribution is shown, and it is compared to three benchmark scenarios predicted by the models introduced in Section 2.

### Fit model and strategy

To assess the presence of any excess over the SM predictions in the signal region, and to set limits on the new physics models considered, a binned likelihood fit is performed exploiting the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{recoil}}\) distributions of the several regions. In the fit model three free floating normalisation factors are used to correct respectively the V+jets processes, the single-top background and the \(t\bar{t}\) MC predictions; the signal simulation is scaled inclusively in \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{recoil}}\) by a parameter which is freely floating in the fit. Gaussian constrained nuisance parameters are used to model the yields variations taking into account the several systematic uncertainties. These parameters are fully correlated among all the different background processes, bins and regions.

The fit strategy consists of two different steps: at first a CR only fit is performed, and the agreement between SM predictions and data in the SR is assessed. In the second step the simultaneous fit of all the CR and the SR is performed by including a free floating parameter which scales inclusively the predictions of the signal model considered. Then, the upper limit on the signal strength is extracted using the CLs approach [37].

As shown in Figure 3, no excesses of data over the SM predictions is observed after a fit to the CR only. The result of a simultaneous fit to the CR and the SR under the background only hypothesis is presented in the same Figure: this shows how the nominal SM predictions are only slightly affected when including the SR in the fit. The results of the upper limit calculation on the signal models considered in this note are shown and discussed in Section 4.

### Effect of systematic uncertainties on signal models

The reconstruction and calibration of standard physics objects is assumed to be valid also for this kind of unconventional signatures. Prefit signal yields of the FRVZ model can vary within the estimated systematic uncertainties related to the jet energy scale and jet energy resolution. These translate into variations between 3.5% at low \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{recoil}}\) and 3% at high \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{recoil}}\) for the benchmark model including the Higgs boson, while variations between 1.2% and 6.3% are obtained when considering a heavier scalar mediator. Uncertainties on the \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\) reconstruction, including the resolution on its measurement and its scale, translate into variations between 2.5% and 1.4% with increasing \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{recoil}}\) in the model with the Higgs boson, while the expected yield can vary between 0.5% and 0.3% as a function of the missing transverse momentum when considering a heavier scalar particle.

Uncertainties on jet energy scale and resolution have an impact ranging between 3% and 7% increasing with \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{recoil}}\) for the signal model with Higgs decaying into scalar particles, with similar variations obtained for the several benchmark mass points investigated. Expected prefit signal yields for this model can vary between 3.5% and 0.2% due to systematic uncertainties related to the missing transverse momentum measurement.

A more detailed view of the impact of most relevant systematic uncertainties on the expected profit signal yields for one benchmark point of each model is reported in Table 3.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{l c} \hline \hline Source of uncertainty and impact on the prefit signal yields (\%) \\ \hline \hline FRVZ model, m\({}_{H}\) = 125 GeV, m\({}_{\gamma d}\) = 400 MeV, c\(\tau_{d}\) = 500 mm \\ \hline Jet energy scale & 1.8 \(-\) 2.4 \\ Jet energy resolution & 1.0 \(-\) 2.1 \\ Jet quark/gluon composition and response & 0.9 \(-\) 2.8 \\ \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\) scale and resolution & 1.2 \(-\) 2.6 \\ \hline \multicolumn{2}{c}{Hss model, m\({}_{H}\) = 125 GeV, m\({}_{s}\) = 5 GeV, c\(\tau_{s}\) = 411 mm} \\ \hline Jet energy scale & 1.7 \(-\) 2.3 \\ Jet energy resolution & 1.0 \(-\) 3.3 \\ Jet quark/gluon composition and response & 0.7 \(-\) 3.1 \\ \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\) scale and resolution & 0.1 \(-\) 2.9 \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}

The bottom pad shows the level of agreement between the data and the SM prediction, with black points indicating the result after a fit to the CR only, and red points after a fit to control plus signal regions in the background only hypothesis. The last bin of the distribution includes all the events with \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{recoil}}>1.2\,\mathrm{TeV}\).

Uncertainties related to both electron (muon) identification efficiency and energy (momentum) scale are found to be negligible. No additional uncertainties are considered on the reconstruction of displaced objects.

An additional 1.7% uncertainty is assigned on the expected yields of each signal model to take into account the uncertainty on the measurement of the ATLAS integrated luminosity during Run-2 operations.

Modelling uncertainties related to scale and PDF variations on the signal samples are neglected.

## 4 Reinterpretation results

In this section, the results obtained with the RECAST framework on the considered signal models are reported and compared to dedicated ATLAS analyses.

### Constraints on FRVZ model

Upper limits at 95% of CL on the branching fraction of the Higgs boson into a pair of \(\gamma_{d}\) are reported in Figure 4 as a function of the dark photon mean proper lifetime. The analysis efficiency varies for the different dark photon decay modes: a \(\gamma_{d}\) decaying into two muons may go completely undetected in the final state if the muon reconstruction requirements, as defined in Ref. [1], are not satisfied. Analogously, a \(\gamma_{d}\) decaying into electrons or light hadrons in the outer layer of the calorimeter can deposit only a portion of its energy in the detector, originating low-\(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) jets which do not pass the identification criteria. For these reasons three separate channels are considered, based on the truth decay products of the dark photon in the events:

* **Muonic channel:** both \(\gamma_{d}\) in the event decay into a pair of muons;
* **Hadronic channel:** both \(\gamma_{d}\) decay into a pair of electrons or light hadrons;
* **Mixed channel:** a \(\gamma_{d}\) decays into a pair of muons and the other decays into either a pair of electrons or into light hadrons.

These definitions are closely related to the ones adopted in Ref. [9], which are instead based on reconstructed objects in the final states, and are useful to show how the analysis sensitivity varies in the several \(\gamma_{d}\) decay modes. While a large hierarchy in the sensitivity is observed in the dedicated analysis, the sensitivity of the monojet reinterpretation is similar in all the channels for large dark photon lifetimes, where it is expected to set competitive constraints.

Existing bounds at low lifetimes can be extended by this work for \(c\tau_{d}<0.9\,\mathrm{mm}\) since the decay products of the \(\gamma_{d}\) can be not properly identified in the final states. In particular, the sensitivity achieved in the Muonic channel derives from the lower efficiency of the lepton veto since muons may not be identified by the standard reconstruction algorithm targeting prompt muons. Indeed, baseline muons, as defined as in Ref. [1], are required to have an inner detector track matched to muon spectrometer hits, and to be associated to the primary vertex satisfying a requirement on the longitudinal impact parameter (\(|z_{0}\sin\theta|<0.5\,\mathrm{mm}\)). Thus, even for small proper lifetimes, the boost of these particles in the final states is such that their decay products may not satisfy the aforementioned criteria, escaping from the interaction point not-identified. However, the sensitivity decreases rapidly in more prompt-like regimes, being the decay products of the \(\gamma_{d}\) better identified by the standard reconstruction algorithms.

The sensitivity loss observed in the hadronic channel below \(10^{2}\) mm is mainly due to the additional photon veto which can be effective in events with displaced electrons, hence not fulfilling the track requirements.

At large lifetimes, \(c\tau_{d}\gtrsim 10^{2}\) mm, observed limits tend to be flat, as expected, since most of the LLPs decay outside the fiducial volume of the ATLAS experiment. For this reason, the upper limits are extrapolated to very large lifetimes from the value of \(c\tau_{d}\) for which the \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\) distribution matches the one expected from the \(gg\to H\to\mathrm{inv}\) process. The observed upper limit on the \(\mathcal{B}(H\to\mathrm{inv})\) obtained is checked to be consistent with the ones obtained with the FRVZ benchmark signal samples with very long lifetimes, and corresponds to \(\mathcal{B}(H\to 2\gamma_{d}+X)<50\%\) @95% CL. This value is higher than the observed upper limit on the invisible branching fraction obtained by the monojet analysis [1], \(\mathcal{B}(H\to\mathrm{inv})<34\%\) @95% CL. This is due to the fact that in this reinterpretation only the \(gg\to H\) production mechanism is considered, which accounts only for

Figure 4: Exclusion contours obtained for a \(\gamma_{d}\) with \(m_{\gamma_{d}}=400\,\mathrm{MeV}\) in the Muonic (green), Hadronic (orange) and Mixed (blue) channels, produced in the decay of SM Higgs boson. The red line shows the exclusion limit obtained in this reinterpretation when combining the three aforementioned channels. The results are compared to the exclusion limits of the dedicated ATLAS search (dashed lines with same colour scheme) [9]. The \(\mathcal{B}(H\to\mathrm{inv})\) limit from the monojet [1] analysis and the combination of ATLAS Run-1 and Run-2 results [8] are also shown in the asymptotic regime of infinite lifetime.

about 73% of the total cross-section.

Current bounds on the production of a pair of \(\gamma_{d}\) from the Higgs boson decay are extended by this monojet reinterpretation at larger mean lifetimes, while more stringent results for values of \(\mathrm{c}\tau_{d}\) between [0.9, 800] mm are still set by the result obtained in the muonic channel by the dedicated search [9]. This is indeed the mean proper lifetimes range for which the LLP search has been optimised, with expected decays of the dark photons in the outer part of the ATLAS experiment.

In the case in which the dark sector particles are produced by the decay of the heavy scalar \(H^{\prime}\), complementary results to the one reported in Ref. [9], are obtained. Figure 5 shows the bounds obtained in the Muonic, Hadronic and Mixed decay channels when an heavier neutral scalar particle is considered. As already mentioned, in this case the boost of the final state dark photons is expected to be higher than the case of the SM Higgs boson. Also in this scenario a similar sensitivity is achieved for the three different decay modes at large proper lifetime as expected. The combined upper limit on the cross-section times branching fraction of the heavy scalar particle reaches asymptotically \(\sigma\times\mathcal{B}(H\to 2\gamma_{d}+X)=1.5\,\mathrm{pb}\), extending existing limits. At large lifetimes, the upper limit is less stringent with respect to the values obtained in the [5, 100] mm range due to the increasing MC statistical uncertainty for the signal samples, which is caused by the lifetime re-weighting procedure. As in the case of the SM Higgs boson, for lower

The red line shows the exclusion limit obtained in this reinterpretation when combining the three aforementioned channels. The results are compared to the exclusion limits of the dedicated ATLAS search (dashed lines with same colour scheme) [9].

lifetimes the lepton veto selection cut is more efficient and reduces the sensitivity of the monojet analysis. However, constraints competitive with the dedicated search can be set at \(c\tau_{d}\lesssim 10\,\text{mm}\), being the latter only sensitive to a limited lifetime range.

The results of both this work and the dedicated ATLAS search in the Higgs sector are also shown in Figure 6 as a function of \(\gamma_{d}\) kinetic mixing parameter \(\varepsilon\) and the \(\gamma_{d}\) mass. In this case, the limits are shown at 90% of CL to be compared with the results of other non-ATLAS searches [38]. The exclusion contour corresponding to \(\mathcal{B}(H\to 2\gamma_{d}+X)=50\%\) is used as a benchmark for this work. In the range of \(\gamma_{d}\) mass [0.2, 2]\(\,\text{GeV}\), the monojet reinterpretation can exclude values of the kinetic mixing parameters below \(10^{-6}\) for very light dark photons, and \(\varepsilon\leq 2\cdot 10^{-6}\) for \(\gamma_{d}\) with \(m_{\gamma_{d}}=2\,\text{GeV}\). The shape of the contour is directly related to the branching fractions of the \(\gamma_{d}\) decays: for masses of the \(\gamma_{d}\) below \(0.5\,\text{GeV}\) the sensitivity slightly increases because the BR of the \(\gamma_{d}\)in pair of muons increases. As can be seen from Figure 4, in fact the most sensitive channels are the Muonic and the Mixed ones. Moreover, Figure 6 highlights the complementarity of the searches carried out by the ATLAS experiment. The dedicated prompt search [28] excludes values of \(\varepsilon\geq 10^{-5}\sim 2\cdot 10^{-6}\) with \(\mathcal{B}(H\to 2\gamma_{d}+X)>10\%\). The dedicated displaced dark photon jet search fills the gap between the prompt and the monojet contours with a \(\mathcal{B}(H\to 2\gamma_{d}+X)\) down to the order of \(1\%\).

### Constraints on exotic Higgs decays into scalar particles

Figure 7 shows the limits on the branching fraction of the SM Higgs boson decaying to a pair of scalar particles as a function of their mean proper lifetime. The results obtained in this work are compared to the constraints coming from dedicated searches [10, 11, 12]. The complementarity among the several analyses can be observed for all the mass values of the scalar particles \(s\) for which different lifetimes regimes are probed by different detection techniques. In this context, the monojet reinterpretation is able to extend the current upper limits to higher \(s\) particle lifetimes.

Differences on the exclusion contours of the several scalar mass hypotheses are expected because of the different boost of their decay products. In the asymptotic regime of stable particles (i.e. for infinite lifetimes) the monojet result approaches the value of \(\mathcal{B}(H\to ss)=50\%\) @95% CL, which is the value obtained by probing the \(H\to\mathrm{inv}\) signature produced in the gluon-gluon fusion process. Hence, such a process is used to extrapolate the contours at proper lifetimes higher than the one corresponding to the re-weighted sample having a compatible \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{recoil}}\) distribution. For comparison purposes, the constraints on the invisible branching fraction of the Higgs boson set by the combination of the ATLAS Run-1 and Run-2 results [8], \(\mathcal{B}(H\to\mathrm{inv})<0.11\), and the monojet analysis [1], \(\mathcal{B}(H\to\mathrm{inv})<0.34\), are also shown. The difference between the latter and the limit result of this work is entirely due to additional production mechanism considered in the original analysis.

## 5 Conclusions

The reinterpretation of the ATLAS full Run-2 monojet search using the RECAST framework was presented.

Limits on long-lived dark photons predicted by the FRVZ models extends the existing constraints on \(\mathcal{B}(H\to 2\gamma_{d}+X)\) for dark photon proper lifetimes larger than 1 m. Additional sensitivity is achieved for \(c\tau_{d}<0.9\) mm. Constraints are also set as a function of the dark photon mass in the range between 0.2 and \(2\,\mathrm{GeV}\). The results exclude values of the kinetic mixing parameters lower than about \(2\cdot 10^{-6}\) at 90% CL, when assuming a branching fraction of the Higgs boson into pair of dark photons equal to 50%.

In the case of the of dark photons produced by the decay of a heavy scalar with \(m_{H^{\prime}}=800\,\mathrm{GeV}\), the monojet analysis is able to extend the current limits at \(c\tau<15\,\mathrm{mm}\) and about \(c\tau>500\,\mathrm{mm}\) in the hypothesis of a dark photon mass of \(400\,\mathrm{MeV}\).

Figure 7: Exclusion contours on \(\mathcal{B}(H\to ss)\) at 95% CL obtained in the monojet analysis reinterpretation shown as a function of the \(s\) particle proper decay length, compared to dedicated searches [10, 11, 12]. The \(s\) bosons are allowed to decay inclusively to all kinematically-allowed final states, with mass-dependent \(s\) boson branching ratios. For \(m_{s}>25\,\mathrm{GeV}\), the branching ratios to \(b\bar{b}\), \(c\bar{c}\), and \(\tau^{+}\tau^{-}\) are approximately constant and given by 85%, 5%, and 8%, respectively. The prompt [10] and inner detector DV-based results [12] assume negligible signal efficiency for decays other than \(s\to b\bar{b}\). The \(\mathcal{B}(H\to\mathrm{inv})\) limit from the monojet [1] analysis and the combination of ATLAS Run-1 and Run-2 results [8] are also shown in the asymptotic regime of infinite lifetime. The dashed area indicates the region with \(\mathcal{B}(H\to ss)>1\).

Limits on the production of a pair of scalar particles from exotic decays of the SM Higgs boson, complementary to the ones from dedicated searches, are also provided. Mean proper lifetimes greater than 0.5 (10) m for scalar particles with \(m_{s}=5\) (55) GeV can be excluded at 95% CL with branching fraction values larger than 50%, which is compatible with the Higgs to invisible results produced in gluon-gluon fusion mode, complementing the current bounds set by the dedicated searches.
