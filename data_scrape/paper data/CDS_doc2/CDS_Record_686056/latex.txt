###### Abstract

A finite element thermal analysis is performed for the ATLAS barrel SCT module. The design of the module are based on the TDR model. Its several variations are also evaluated. The goal of the present calculation is to estimate the safety margin for the thermal runaway and its dependence on various design parameters.

## 1 Module design

As a follow-up of the previous thermal simulation study on various module designs [1], two module geometries and their variations are evaluated as listed in Table 1. Model TDR-1 is the geometry proposed in the ATLAS ID TDR [2]. Model TDR-2 is a model with no BeO stiffeners (see pictures). Figure 1 shows the models TDR-1 and TDR-2. The 40 mrad tilting of stereo angle is neglected for simplicity.

## 2 Module design

As a follow-up of the previous thermal simulation study on various module designs [1], two module geometries and their variations are evaluated as listed in Table 1. Model TDR-1 is the geometry proposed in the ATLAS ID TDR [2]. Model TDR-2 is a model with no BeO stiffeners (see pictures). Figure 1 shows the models TDR-1 and TDR-2. The 40 mrad tilting of stereo angle is neglected for simplicity.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{c c c} \hline model & variation & description \\ TDR-1 & 1 & TDR model \\  & 1a & right PG replaced by BeO \\  & 1b & all BeO baseboard \\  & 1c & BeO attachment at the cooling side \\  & 1d & shorter PG nose by 1cm \\  & 1e & longer PG nose by 1cm \\  & 1f & all PG baseboard \\  & 1g & all PG baseboard, no stiffener at cooling side \\  & 1h & all PG baseboard, CFRP inserts \\  & 1i & model-1h but insulator on the non-cooling side \\ TDR-2 & 2 & No stiffeners, BeO frame \\  & 2a & no BeO bypass in the middle \\  & 2b & inclined PG nose \\ \hline \end{tabular}

the BeO and PG baseboards since its effect in non-negligible. In addition air is introduced between the BeO bridge and silicon detector surface. Bonding wires between the pitch adapter and silicon detector, though their effects turned out to be thermally negligible,

### Constraints and environments:

For simplicity, the effects of surface convection and radiation emission are not included.

The cooling pipe is not included in the simulation. Instead, the temperature constraint is imposed at the contact of the cooling channel. The open triangle marks in the design figures show the location of this external constraint.

### Heat generation in electronics:

Heat generation in the electronics is simulated by usual bulk heat generation provided in ANSYS. The total heat generation in electronics is assumed to be 4.5 Watts, corresponding to 2.25 W per side. 87% of the heat is assumed to be generated in the 1st chips (I x w x h = 7.2 x 4.0 x 0.35 mm\({}^{3}\)) and the rest is generated in the 2nd chip (I x w x h = 7.2 x 5.5 x 0.35 mm\({}^{3}\)).

### Heat generation in the silicon bulk:

The heat generation in the bulk of the radiation-damaged silicon detector is due to the bulk leakage current. The leakage current is known to have a strong temperature dependence:

\[\mathbb{I}_{\text{leak}}\propto\mathbb{T}^{2}\cdot\mathrm{e}^{\frac{\mathbb{E }_{g}}{2\mathrm{k_{B}}\mathbb{T}}}\]

where \(\mathrm{E}_{g}\) is the effective gap energy of about 1.23 eV and \(\mathrm{k_{B}}\) is the Boltzmann constant. In ANSYS program, the electrical resistance of material can be made temperature dependent. An electro-thermal element (SOLID67) is assigned for the bulk part of the silicon detector and it is assumed to carry an electrical conductance with the same temperature dependence as that of the leakage current [3].

Since the heat generation strongly depends on temperature, it must be standerized at specific temperature. It is proposed to use the heat generation per mm\({}^{2}\) of 300 \(\mathrm{\SIUnitSymbolMicro m}\) thick silicon detector at 0\({}^{\circ}\)C as a standard parameter. Actual heat generation is calculated using the T-dependence give above.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{c c|c c} \hline
**material** & **conductivity (W/m-K)** & **material** & **conductivity (W/m-K)** \\ \hline silicon & 130 & BeO & 280 \\ PG700 & 700 (tangential) & PG1300 & 1300 (tangential) \\  & 3.5 (normal) & & 3.5 (normal) \\ PG1700 & 1700 (tangential) & CFRP & 25 (tangential) \\  & 3.5 (normal) & & 1 (normal) \\ thermal glue & 0.5 & Kapton hybrid & 0.25 \\ air & 0.0245 & BeO hybrid & 280 \\ quartz (fan-in) & 0.15 & bonding wire & 150 \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}

### Comparison with experiments:

The thermal simulation were compared with various laboratory tests and agreement with test results are excellent, though convection as well as radiation from the surface of the test pieces had to be introduced with some adjustable parameters [3].

Thermal runaway was experimentally observed at KEK in a radiation damaged CDF-SVX microstrip detector [4]. A thermal simulation reproduced the observed runaway fairly well as shown in Figure 3.

## 3 Results of thermal simulation

### Typical thermal profiles

Figures 4 and 5 show typical thermal profiles of various views for the case of model TDR-1 with PG700, 4.5W in electronics power consumption, -10\({}^{\circ}\)C for the cooling temperature constraint, and 160 \(\upmu\)W/mm\({}^{2}\) in bulk heat generation (at 0\({}^{\circ}\)C).

Figure 4: Top view of the thermal profile.

Figure 3: Thermal runaway observed in radiation damaged detector and thermal simulation[4]. T\({}_{\rm cool}\) and T\({}_{\rm env}\) are the temperatures of the cooling water and the vacuum vessel in which the runaway test is performed.

One sees that the case shown is close to the thermal runaway point, and therefore the maximum temperature in the silicon detector is seen at the top left corner as expected. In the profile of the baseboard, the apparent discontinuity in temperature is seen at the boundaries between PG and BeO plates where the gluing gaps exist.

## 4 Conclusions

The present thermal simulation based on the TDR model is summerized in the following:

1. The PG baseboard is needed. Replacing it by BeO degrades the thermal performance.
2. The PG part near the cooling channel plays the most essential role.
3. Power consumption of the electronics must be minimized to lower the average detector temperature, though the thermal runaway point is not so much affected.
4. PG1300 is much better than PG700 and the difference between PG1700 and 1300 is small.
5. All-PG baseboard shows superior thermal behavior.
6. The insuration on the farther side (from cooling) gives little difference.
7. No BeO stiffener models give less performance.
8. There are little dependence on the shape of the PG nose,
9. Lower cooling temperature is essential to get safety margin from thermal runaway.
