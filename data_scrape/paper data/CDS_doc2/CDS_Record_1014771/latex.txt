###### Abstract

Extensive calculations were performed with the general activation formula using the fluxes of high-energy hadrons and low-energy neutrons previously obtained from simulations with the GCALOR code of the ATLAS detector. Three sets of proton cross-sections were used for hadrons energy above 20 MeV: (a) one set calculated with the YIELDX code (i.e., the Silberberg-Tsao formula of partial proton spallation cross-sections), (b) one set calculated with the Rudstam formula, and (c) the 'best-estimate' dataset which was a compilation of the available experimental and calculated data. In the energy region below 20 MeV, neutron activation cross-sections were taken from evaluated nuclear data files. The activity of each nuclide for a predefined operation scenario (i.e., number and duration of irradiation and shutdown cycles) was normalized to reference values taken from the European or Swiss legislations, to obtain an aggregate estimate of the radiological hazard comparable with a nuclear waste zoning definition criteria that has been adopted by the LHC experiments. The impact of changing the operation scenario and hadrons spallation cross-sections datasets on the zoning was investigated for the 21 most common materials.

## 1 Introduction

The installation of the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is under completion in a circular tunnel 27 km in circumference, previously housing the Large Electron Positron (LEP) collider. The tunnel, placed at a depth varying between 50 and 175 m, straddles the Swiss/French border on the outskirts of Geneva. LHC is designed to collide two counter rotating beams of protons or heavy ions. Proton-proton collisions are foreseen at an energy of 7 TeV per beam with a planned start-up in 2007. Each proton beam consists of 2808 bunches at full intensity, each bunch containing 1.15\(\times\)10\({}^{11}\) protons at the start of a nominal fill. The total energy stored in the nominal beam at top energy is 334 MJ. This enormous amount of energy will partly be deposited at the beam dumps at the end of each physics period, partly be dissipated in collimators and a certain fraction will convert into secondary particles following collisions at the centre of the experimental apparatus. Interaction of the primary and secondary particles with any material will generate induced radioactivity.

ATLAS (A Toroidal LHC ApparatuS), the biggest of the LHC experiments, is installed in an underground cavern. ATLAS is 42 m long, 11 m in radius and weighs approximately 7000 tons. It is one of the two high-luminosity, general-purpose LHC detectors (together with CMS). Beams of protons will collide at its centre with a centre of mass energy of 14 TeV and a design luminosity of 10\({}^{34}\) cm\({}^{\text{-2}}\) s\({}^{\text{-1}}\). The collisions will create a harsh radiation environment that will cause activation of material, some (and eventually all) of which will become radioactive waste.

The LHC machine and the experiments are classified as Nuclear Basic Installation (_Installation Nucleaire de Base_, INB) in France. The French legislation requires that INB installations provide - among other things - a radioactive waste study before starting operation. A compulsory part of the study is the identification of areas where radioactive waste may be produced from areas where only the production of conventional waste is expected. In case of the LHC experiments this translates into the identification of a boundary dividing the experimental cavern into two zones - a radioactive waste zone and a conventional waste zone.

The French legislation does not provide unconditional clearance levels, e.g., threshold values in terms of specific activity, below which a material can be released from the regulatory control into the public domain (after a proper radiation survey). A material can only be exempted from the regulatory control through a detailed theoretical study supported by experimental measurements. The aim of such a study is to establish a "zoning" (_zonage_) of the facility (accelerator tunnel, experimental areas, etc), i.e., a classification of areas where material may or may not have been activated to a level of concern. To demonstrate that a given component or material is "non-radioactive", i.e., "conventional", one has to prove that beam losses around the ring, or any other activation mechanism, can only produce "insignificant" amounts of radioactivity.

The present report describes methods, input data (including associated assumptions and potential sources of uncertainty), and results of the study performed in order to provide the basis for the choice of the nuclear waste zoning boundary in the ATLAS experiment.

The report is structured as follows. Section 2 describes the methodology generally applicable for an activation study and the basic criteria used for the classification of activated materials. Section 3 presents the compiled input data used for the study and is followed by Section 4, which describes specific techniques and adjustments necessary to implement the general methodology with respect to the format and deficiencies of available input data. Finally, Section 5 outlines the basic results obtained in the course of the study and the major findings are formulated in Section 6.

### Materials

Knowledge of geometry (design) and materials of an installation under study is crucial. First it is necessary for the fluxes/spectra calculations and then for the activity calculation based on the fluxes and concentrations of target materials. This last task usually requires a better quality of the knowledge of the materials. For example, in order to have a correct prediction of particle fluxes/spectra one usually needs only to account for the main components and structural materials (iron, copper, aluminum, carbon, lead, etc.), and this info can be extracted from engineering drawings and specifications. While for correct prediction of the induced activity, specifically in the low energy region (i.e., neutron capture reactions) one should pay special attention to important impurities like cobalt, silver, europium, cesium etc. with typical concentrations of only a few dozen ppm. As a rule, the impurities are not readily available for most materials.

For the purpose of the study, one can identify a representative set of individual materials that are the most common constituents of the ATLAS components and structures: Be, C, Al, Si, Ti, Cr, Mn, Fe, Ni, Co, Cu, Zn, Nb, Sn, Sb, Ag, W, Re, Au, Pb. The list includes:

* base structural materials such as Be, C, Al, Fe, Ni, Cu, W, Pb;
* minor materials which are either alloying constituents or encountered as small components: Si, Ti, Cr, Mn, Zn, Nb, Sn, Ag, Sb, Re, Au;
* impurities in various materials at trace level: Co, Ag.

The only composite material considered in this study is stainless steel (69% Fe, 18% Cr, 11% Ni, 1.8% Mn, and 0.2% Co).

Despite the fact that the ATLAS detector is approaching its commissioning phase, there were not sufficiently complete and structured information on the material composition available that would meet requirements for a comprehensive activation study. In order to remain on the conservative side, a "dual" approach was followed. So in the first phase the best available description of the experiment and its materials was used to simulate the particle fluxes. In the second phase it was assumed that the experiment was made of all the pure materials listed above to calculate specific activity. Practically, one has to assume that the entire experimental volume is filled with the particular target material in question (e.g., beryllium, carbon, aluminum, etc.) and to provide separate considerations for each of the materials to define the largest zone.

### Operating scenarios

In order to estimate induced activity, one needs to know at the minimum the period of operation, the average power (or luminosity in our case) during the operation period, and the cooling time. For a more correct modeling of the operational history one should account for all operational periods, variation of power, and shutdowns. For practical reasons, it is convenient to present the dependence of relative power (the ratio of real power \(W\) to nominal power \(W_{nom}\)) during the whole operation history as a step-wise function of time, i.e., as a sequence of \(m\) time intervals \(\Delta T_{j}\) when the power is constant.

The real operation history is uncertain until the start of operation or until the final shutdown (decommissioning). Therefore, any study of activation prior to the final shutdown is dependent on possible scenarios of the future operation. Up to now there is no definitive knowledge of the lifecycle of the LHC and the experiments. As a result, one may consider several scenarios.

For the purpose of this study, the following two scenarios - baseline and alternative - were defined on the basis of recommendations provided in [4]:

* "the ATLAS operating scenario": an ATLAS year consists of 120 days of continuous running and 245 days of shutdown;
* "the CMS operating scenario": a CMS year is 60 days ON, 10 days OFF, 60 days ON, 10 days OFF, 60 days ON, 165 days OFF.

Also, based on the two baseline scenarios a number of modified scenarios were defined by changing the number of operating cycles, luminosity, and cooling time.

The ATLAS operating scenarios:

(A1) 10 years of operation at a luminosity of \(10^{34}\) followed by 100 days of cooling

(A2) 2 years of operation at a luminosity of \(10^{34}\) followed by 100 days of cooling

(A3) 2 years of operation at a luminosity of \(2\cdot 10^{33}\) followed by 100 days of cooling

(A4) 10 years of operation at a luminosity of \(10^{34}\) followed by 2 years of cooling

(A5) 2 years of operation at a luminosity of \(2\cdot 10^{33}\) followed by 10 days of cooling

The CMS operating scenarios:

(C1) 13 years(i of operation at a luminosity of \(5\cdot 10^{33}\) followed by 100 days of cooling

(C2) 13 years of operation at a luminosity of \(5\cdot 10^{33}\) followed by 2 years of cooling

(C3) 13 years of operation at a luminosity of \(5\cdot 10^{33}\) followed by 10 days of cooling

### Fluxes

The fluxes of high-energy hadrons and low-energy neutrons in a fine spatial mesh were obtained from simulations carried out by Mike Shupe with the GCALOR code in a realistic 3D GEANT geometry implementation of the ATLAS detector [5]. The calculated fluxes in plain ASCII format together with a read-back procedure are available on the Activation Web Page [6]. The following information about the energy spectra and spatial distribution was available for the activation calculations:

* For each fine spatial bin (as defined below), the following flux information is available (see fig. 1-8):
* Thermal neutron flux (10\({}^{-5}\) eV to 0.414 eV)
* Moderated neutron flux (0.414 eV to 3.78 keV)
* Intermediate neutron flux (3.78 keV to 2.19 MeV)
* Fast neutron flux (2.19 MeV to 20 MeV)
* High energy neutron flux (above 20 MeV)
* Proton flux (above 20 MeV)
* \(\pi^{+}\) flux (above 20 MeV)
* \(\pi^{+}\) flux (above 20 MeV)
* The fine spatial binning of the GCALOR calculation of particle fluxes \(\Delta\)Z = 10 cm (0\(<\)Z\(<\)2400 cm) \(\Delta\)R = 1 cm (4\(<\)R\(<\)120 cm) \(\Delta\)R = 10 cm (120\(<\)R\(<\)1200 cm)
* The following flux information was in addition available for two sets of spatial binning:
* neutron flux spectra \(\Delta\)Z = 10 cm (0\(<\)Z\(<\)2400 cm) \(\Delta\)R = 10 cm (0\(<\)R\(<\)50 cm) \(\Delta\)Z = 100 cm (0\(<\)Z\(<\)2400 cm) \(\Delta\)R = 100 cm (0\(<\)R\(<\)1200 cm)
* proton flux spectra
* \(\pi^{+}\) flux spectra
* \(\pi^{+}\) flux spectra \(\Delta\)Z = 10 cm (0\(<\)Z\(<\)2400 cm) \(\Delta\)R = 10 cm (0\(<\)R\(<\)50 cm) \(\Delta\)Z = 50 cm (0\(<\)Z\(<\)2400 cm) \(\Delta\)R = 50 cm (0\(<\)R\(<\)1200 cm)

Neutron energy spectra were calculated in 60 log-uniform bins within an energy range from 0.414 eV to 139 GeV. Charged particle spectra were calculated in 20 log-uniform bins within an energy range from 12.9 MeV to 89.3 GeV.

The available flux information in the fine and coarse spatial binning was interpolated in order to obtain the spatial and spectral flux information used in the activation calculations. A few examples of typical flux spectra are provided in figures 9-10.

### Radionuclide decay data

Knowledge of basic nuclide characteristics, i.e., natural abundance of stable nuclides and half-lives and decay branching ratios of radionuclides, is necessary for the simulation of radionuclide build-up/decay processes. These characteristics have been evaluated for virtually all the known radionuclides and are distributed as evaluated nuclear structure data files ENSDF [7], with new evaluations published in the Nuclear Data Sheets monthly journal.

The basic decay characteristics of radionuclides are also available as specialized data-sets processed from the ENSDF files. These data-sets are easily available as web-based or downloadable databases and more user-friendly than sophisticatedly formatted evaluated files and thus more preferable for routine applications. For the purpose of this study, NuDat 2.1 [8] - a widely known database of this kind - was used as the single source of radionuclide decay data.

### Activation cross-sections

When studying radionuclide production in high-energy hadron accelerator experiments, one may limit the consideration to the activation of stable target nuclei with hadrons only. Provided the accelerator energy is sufficiently high, most of the induced radioactivity is usually due to inelastic interactions of secondary particles - neutrons, protons and positive and negative pions [9]. Other particles rarely play any significant role. This is particularly true close to the beam-pipe where most of the induced activation is taking place. Energy spectra of secondary hadrons depend on the beam energy and, primarily, on the shielding and other surrounding material. The energy of hadrons extends from thermal energies (for neutrons) to hundreds of GeV. Up to now, the activation (i.e., radionuclide production) cross-sections are not readily available for all the particles and materials of interest within the entire energy range.

#### 3.5.1 The energy region below 20 MeV

For most of the important materials, neutron activation cross-sections are well studied from thermal energies to 20 MeV since these data are widely used for nuclear reactor calculations and other important applications. The tabulated data are available from a number of evaluated nuclear data files (ENDF/B, JENDL, JEFF, etc.).

One should note that in the energy region below 20 MeV only neutrons make a significant contribution to activation. This is evident from the analysis of hadron spectra and inelastic cross-sections. First, the fraction of neutrons in hadron spectra below 20 MeV exceeds the fraction of charged particles (protons and pions) at least by an order of magnitude (see, fig. 9-10). Second, in the energy region above a few MeV, the activation is dominated by inelastic interactions of hadrons with nuclei. Inelastic cross-sections are smooth functions of energy and may vary for different hadrons within one order of magnitude (see, fig. 11 [10]) with neutrons dominating below 30 MeV. As a result, contribution of charged particles to the activation below 20 MeV is negligible. Accordingly, the need for nuclide production cross-sections below 20 MeV are fully satisfied with the already existing neutron nuclear data.

For the purpose of this study, neutron activation cross-sections were taken from both ENDFB-6.8 [11] and JEFF-3.0A [12] (in the order of preference). All the nuclear reactions that produce radioactive nuclides with half-life longer than 1 hour and shorter than \(10^{6}\) years are listed in Table 2.

#### 3.5.2 The energy region above 20 MeV

For the second energy region - above 20 MeV - all the particles are important (neutrons, pions, protons - in the order of importance). There are almost no evaluated (or recommended) tabulated activation cross-sections up to the GeV region for neutrons or protons while tabulated data for pions are completely missing.

As a result, for the activation study one has first to compile and analyze the available activation cross-section data. A number of tabulated data libraries calculated with various nuclear model codes, semi-empirical formulas of spallation yields, and experimental data can be used as a source of activation cross-section data. A brief review of the data sources used is given below.

#### The tabulated data

The nuclide production processes are being actively studied for protons and neutrons from 20 MeV to 100-200 MeV. These data are used in the conceptual design of sub-critical nuclear energy installations with an external neutron source (Accelerator Driven Systems) and in the design of accelerators for long-lived nuclear waste transmutation. There are available several data libraries based on nuclear model code calculations, for example:

* New versions of ENDF/B files (since version 6.8) contain neutron and proton data for some materials up to 150 MeV. Unfortunately, the list of materials (stable target nuclides) is rather short. The data were calculated with a version of the ALICE code (i.e., the cross-section data may not be referred to as "evaluated").
* Another widely used neutron and proton activation data library, the MENDL library, was calculated with the ALICE-IPPE code up to 100 MeV for neutrons [13] and up to 200 MeV for protons [14]. The main advantage of the library is an exhaustive list of target materials, including long-lived radionuclides.
* Recently, JAERI provided JENDL High Energy files for protons and neutrons up to 3 GeV for 40 materials [15]. However, both quality and applicability of the data for the purpose of this study are questionable.

The Medical isotope production library [16] is probably the only charged particle activation cross-section library, which is based on rigorous evaluation of experimental data. However, neither the energy range nor the list of evaluated reactions satisfy the needs for this study.

The compilation by Sobolevsky et al. [17], is an example of a good set of tabulated proton activation cross-sections up to 10 GeV based on experimental data. This compilation may be used in practical applications. However, the list of compiled cross-sections is limited to the most common materials for which sufficient amount of measured data were published (e.g., Al - 7 functions, Fe - 16, Ni - 15, Cu - 17). Other important target materials such as lead and tungsten are not compiled (Pb - 3 functions, W - 0). This compilation is based on experimental data included into the NUCLEX [18] database and, consequently, does not consider a large volume of experimental data published after 1998.

#### Cross section formulas

Historically, activation of accelerator components was studied with the use of semi-empirical formulas for proton cross-sections developed for astrophysics research. First of all, there is the Rudstam formula [19], which was developed in the middle of sixties, and then the Silberberg-Tsao formula [20-24] that was last updated in the late nineties. Rudstam is a simple and not veryaccurate formula, especially for deep spallation processes (i.e., when the atomic weight difference between the target and the product exceeds \(\sim\)30 mass units) and for targets within 3-4 mass units of the product. The Silberberg-Tsao formula is rather complex and provides better results. It is implemented in FORTRAN and is available from the GSI site as the YIELDX code [25]. Both formulas have limitations:

* They work well for high energies (from about 50 MeV) and do not work near the reaction threshold;
* They are designed for protons only;
* One cannot calculate tritium production with them.

The last of the above limitations is not a significant deficiency since the contribution of tritium to the total LE equivalent is negligible. Production of tritium may furthermore be estimated using the semi-empirical formula by Konobeev and Korovin [26], which provides a relatively good prediction of the tritium production cross-section in interactions of protons, neutrons, and light nuclei (He-3, He-4) with materials ranging from carbon to bismuth.

Experimental data

There are a lot of experimental data published for radionuclide production cross-sections. A thorough analysis of thousands of individual publications would be impossible. In this study, we consider only two major compilations of experimental data - EXFOR and NUCLEX. EXFOR is readily available from IAEA [27] and NEA [28] web-sites. NUCLEX [18] is available both in printed form and as an ACCESS data-base. Most experimental data above 20 MeV are for protons while data for neutrons and pions are very sparse. The compilations are not yet exhaustive and are partially overlapping. However, in aggregate, these two sources seem to provide a rather thorough selection of published experimental results.

Analysis of the sources of cross-section data mentioned above has shown that:

* the available tabulated data from nuclear model code calculations for protons (up to 200 MeV) and neutrons (up to 100-150 MeV) do not cover the entire energy region of interest; the quality and applicability range of the data are also questionable;
* there is a number of semi-empirical formulas for protons which are usable for nearly all materials, but the applicability range in terms of atomic weight of produced nuclei and energies is also questionable;
* neither nuclear model codes nor formulas allow to separate yields for ground and isomeric states of the radionuclides produced;
* there is a vast collection of experimental data for proton cross-sections, however, the data cannot be directly used in simulations since it is necessary to evaluate the data and make interpolations in the energy regions not covered well by the experiments; the data are in any case useful for a qualitative assessment of the calculated data;
* there are no tabulated data for pions;
* experimental data for neutrons and pions is insufficient.

Taking into account the aforementioned deficiencies in the cross-section data, one has to use the following approach in the compilation and assessment of the **proton** cross-sections:

* The Silberberg-Tsao formula is used as a primary source of input data for protons;
* The Rudstam formula is used only to cross-check the Silberberg-Tsao formula;
* A "best estimate" dataset of proton cross-sections was compiled using all available information. This made it possible to benchmark the Silberberg-Tsao and Rudstam formulas, the MENDL-2p library, and other data (if necessary) against a representative pool of experimental data.

For **neutrons and pions**, the proton cross sections will have to be used within the energy region above 20 MeV. One can provide a reasonable motivation for such a substitution. Analysis of inelastic cross-sections (fig. 11) shows that the pion cross sections are several times higher than those for protons in the energy region 40-400 MeV. On the other hand, the fraction of pions in the aggregate hadron spectra in this energy region is usually much lower than that of protons (see fig. 9-10) and, consequently, the effect of the substitution will not be very high. For energy above 400 MeV, the behavior of inelastic cross-section for protons and pions is rather similar and the difference never exceeds 30%. In the case of the neutrons, the similarity of inelastic cross-section is even more evident - the difference does not exceed 10% in the entire energy region above 20 MeV. As a result, one may expect that the use of proton cross-sections for all hadrons, including neutrons and pions, may produce an 'additional' uncertainty of some 30-50%, which is acceptable when we take into consideration that the proton cross-sections themselves are not usually known with better accuracy.

A somewhat similar approach underlies the concept of \(\omega\)-factors, which has been used for decades in evaluation of activation in accelerator materials [29]. The core of the concept is that hadron flux spectra above a certain energy limit (usually 20 or 50 MeV) are folded with corresponding inelastic cross-sections to obtain total number of inelastic interactions (so-called'stars') per unit of volume; then the'stars' are multiplied by \(\omega\)(_T,t_) - a function of irradiation time \(T\) and cooling time \(t\) - to calculate dose rate on the surface of semi-infinite uniformly irradiated material. An implicit assumption behind the concept is that \(\omega\)(_T,t_) does not strongly depend on the type of hadrons and their spectra above the specified energy limit. A more recent study of \(\omega\)(_T,t_) for various spectra using FLUKA has shown that disregarding the real hadron spectra may lead to an uncertainty within a factor of 3-5 [9].

However, the issue of applicability of the proton cross-sections as a substitute to other hadrons is still open but some results recently provided with FLUKA simulations support the correctness of this approach. The resulting effect of merging all hadrons into the proton category on the predictions accuracy of P-32 and P-33 activity in liquid argon in the ATLAS electromagnetic calorimeters has been studied [30]. The outcome of the study is that in this particular case, the substitution incurs an additional inaccuracy of about 20%.

There were three sets of cross-sections prepared for the purpose of the present study. Each of the following sets includes cross-sections for all produced radionuclides with half-life longer than 1 hour and shorter than 10\({}^{6}\) years. If the product nuclei can be found in both ground and metastable states, then the m/(g+m) ratio was assumed to be equal 1/2. When necessary, the production of short-lived precursors was accounted for by increasing the respective cross-sections of 'long-lived' radionuclides (i.e., use was made of cumulative cross-sections).

1. A cross-section dataset for all the 20 individual target materials based on the Silberberg-Tsao formula was calculated.
2. A cross-section dataset for all the 20 individual target materials based on the Rudstam formula was calculated;
3. A "best estimate" cross-section dataset for Be, C, Al, Si, Ar, Cr, Mn, Fe, Ni, Cu (see attachments to this report) based on the available data, including EXFOR, NUCLEX, MENDL-2p, the Medical library, the compilation of Sobolevsky et al., and finally the energy threshold data [31]. A simple 'by-hand' interpolation technique was used as proposed in [32].

A side effect of the "best estimate" cross-section dataset compilation is an additional confidence in the applicability of Silberberg-Tsao formula for all the studied radionuclides (within a factor 2-3 for energy above 50 MeV). A limited analysis of the results using the Rudstam formula has confirmed that it is a priori less accurate formula than the Silberberg-Tsao formula. It does, however, provide relatively good results for spallation products above 100 MeV where the difference between the target and product nuclide is between 3 and 30 atomic mass units. For most radionuclides, both the Silberberg-Tsao and the Rudstam formulas provide conservative results below 100 MeV. An extensive comparison has shown that the MENDL-2p library provides an acceptable accuracy (within a factor of 2-3) in the energy region from the reaction threshold up to 100 MeV.

## 4 The specific approach with respect to the available input data

While taking into consideration the actual volume, format and quality of the input data that have been compiled, one should identify the specific approach/techniques necessary to implement the general methodology formulated in Section 2.

The specific activity of individual radionuclides was calculated based on the flux spectra calculated in discrete spatial (in R and Z) and energy intervals (bins) using the realistic ATLAS geometry model (see Section 3.3). Section 4.1 below defines more exactly the activation formula (Equation 1) in order to account for the discrete format of the fluxes.

Specific activity of individual radionuclides produced in particular target material by low energy neutrons (E\(<\) 20 MeV) and high energy hadrons (i.e., neutrons, protons, positive and negative pions above 20 MeV) are calculated separately and then summed up. This is done because of the different formats of the available cross-section data in the two energy regions (see Section 3.5).

Another step required for the implementation of the activation formula (Equation 1) is the definition of a concrete technique to calculate the radionuclide build-up function. Section 4.2 below describes the simple analytical technique developed for the calculation of the build-up function with respect to the typical duration of the irradiation and cooling periods for the identified operating scenarios (see Section 3.2).

Since the precise distribution of target materials is not known within the entire ATLAS experiment area (i.e., it is impossible to exclude the possibility that a small item with high content of a target material may be situated at any location), the most general conservative assumption has to be used and that is that such a material can be located anywhere within the studied area. Practically, this was implemented by taking concentration of target nuclei \(n\) in equation (1) independent of location \(\,\vec{r}\,\) and repeating calculations for each material (Be, C, Al, etc.) to define the material giving the largest zone.

Finally, the calculated specific activities of individual radionuclides are weighed by the LE values (Equation 2) and are plotted as 2D isoline graphs in R-Z coordinates for each target material. Within the \(\Sigma_{k}\)(A\({}_{k}\)/LE\({}_{k}\))=0.1 isoline curve, the target material is considered as "nuclear waste" and beyond the isoline the material is considered as "conventional waste." The 0.1-isoline that is the most distant from the beam-line, i.e., the one enveloping all the other target materials, will be the "zoning boundary", beyond which no "radioactive" material is expected to be produced under the specific operation scenario.

Then the build-up of radionuclides after exposure at a constant luminosity during time \(T\) and cooling time \(t\) are calculated using the following equations:

\[\text{BuildUp}^{1}\left(T,t\right)=\lambda_{1}\ N_{1}\big{(}T\big{)} \text{exp}\big{(}-\lambda_{1}\,t\big{)} \tag{7}\] \[\text{BuildUp}^{2}\left(T,t\right)=\lambda_{2}P_{1}\lambda_{1}N_{ 1}\big{(}T\big{)}\Bigg{[}\frac{\text{exp}\big{(}-\lambda_{1}\,t\big{)}}{ \lambda_{2}-\lambda_{1}}+\frac{\text{exp}\big{(}-\lambda_{2}\,t\big{)}}{ \lambda_{1}-\lambda_{2}}\Bigg{]}+\lambda_{2}\ N_{2}\big{(}T\big{)}\text{exp} \big{(}-\lambda_{2}\,t\big{)}\] (8) \[\text{BuildUp}^{3}\left(T,t\right)=\lambda_{3}P_{3}P_{1}\lambda_ {2}\lambda_{1}N_{1}\big{(}T\big{)}\Bigg{[}\frac{\text{exp}\big{(}-\lambda_{1} \,t\big{)}}{\big{(}\lambda_{3}-\lambda_{1}\big{)}\big{(}\lambda_{2}-\lambda_{ 1}\big{)}}+\frac{\text{exp}\big{(}-\lambda_{2}\,t\big{)}}{\big{(}\lambda_{1}- \lambda_{2}\big{)}\big{(}\lambda_{3}-\lambda_{2}\big{)}}+\] \[+\frac{\text{exp}\big{(}-\lambda_{3}\,t\big{)}}{\big{(}\lambda_ {1}-\lambda_{3}\big{)}\big{(}\lambda_{2}-\lambda_{3}\big{)}}\Bigg{]}+\lambda_{ 3}P_{3}\lambda_{2}N_{2}\big{(}T\big{)}\Bigg{[}\frac{\text{exp}\big{(}-\lambda_ {2}\,t\big{)}}{\lambda_{3}-\lambda_{2}}+\frac{\text{exp}\big{(}-\lambda_{3}\,t \big{)}}{\lambda_{2}-\lambda_{3}}\Bigg{]}+\] (9) \[+\lambda_{3}P_{2}\lambda_{1}N_{1}\big{(}T\big{)}\Bigg{[}\frac{ \text{exp}\big{(}-\lambda_{1}\,t\big{)}}{\lambda_{3}-\lambda_{1}}+\frac{\text {exp}\big{(}-\lambda_{3}\,t\big{)}}{\lambda_{1}-\lambda_{3}}\Bigg{]}+\lambda_{ 3}\ N_{3}\big{(}T\big{)}\text{exp}\big{(}-\lambda_{3}\,t\big{)}\] \[N_{1}\big{(}T\big{)}\!=\frac{1-\text{exp}\big{(}-\lambda_{1}\,T \big{)}}{\lambda_{1}}\] (10) \[N_{2}\big{(}T\big{)}\!=\!P_{1}\Bigg{[}\frac{1-\text{exp}\big{(}- \lambda_{2}\,T\big{)}}{\lambda_{2}}+\frac{\text{exp}\big{(}-\lambda_{1}\,T \big{)}\!-\!\text{exp}\big{(}-\lambda_{2}\,T\big{)}}{\lambda_{1}-\lambda_{2}} \Bigg{]}\] (11) \[N_{3}\big{(}T\big{)}\!=\ P_{1}P_{3}\Bigg{[}\frac{1\!-\!\text{exp} \big{(}-\lambda_{3}\,T\big{)}}{\lambda_{3}}+\frac{\lambda_{2}}{\lambda_{2}- \lambda_{1}}\frac{\text{exp}\big{(}-\lambda_{1}\,T\big{)}\!-\!\text{exp}\big{(} -\lambda_{3}\,T\big{)}}{\lambda_{1}-\lambda_{3}}+\] (12) \[+\frac{\lambda_{1}}{\lambda_{1}-\lambda_{2}}\frac{\text{exp}\big{(} -\lambda_{2}\,T\big{)}\!-\!\text{exp}\big{(}-\lambda_{3}\,T\big{)}}{\lambda_{3} -\lambda_{2}}\Bigg{]}+P_{2}\left[\frac{1\!-\!\text{exp}\big{(}-\lambda_{3}\,T \big{)}}{\lambda_{3}}+\frac{\text{exp}\big{(}-\lambda_{1}\,T\big{)}\!-\!\text{ exp}\big{(}-\lambda_{3}\,T\big{)}}{\lambda_{1}-\lambda_{3}}\right] \tag{13}\]

In the case, when the operation history is modeled by a stepwise function of time (see section 3.2), i.e., as a sequence of \(m\) time intervals \(\Delta T_{\text{j}}\) with constant luminosity \(W_{\text{j}}\), then the build-up is calculated using the following equation:

\[\text{BuildUp}\,\text{p}\,\text{n}=\sum_{j=1}^{m}\frac{W_{j}}{W_{nom}}\text{ BuildUp}\,\text{n}\Bigg{(}\Delta T_{j},\sum_{i=j+1}^{m}\Delta T_{i}\Bigg{)} \tag{14}\]

where \(W_{nom}\) is nominal luminosity, i.e., luminosity at which the particle flux was calculated, and \(\text{BuildUp}\,\text{n}\big{(}T,t\big{)}\) is defined by equations (7-13) respectively for the activation product (n=1), its daughter (n=2), and grand-daughter (n=3) nuclide.

In addition, cumulative cross-section of \({}^{77}_{36}\)Kr  is the sum of independent production cross-sections for \({}^{77}_{36}\)Kr, \({}^{77}_{37}\)Rb, \({}^{77}_{38}\)Sr, and \({}^{77}_{39}\)Y ; cumulative cross-section of \({}^{77}_{35}\)Br  is the sum of independent production cross-sections for \({}^{77}_{35}\)Br, \({}^{77}_{35}\)Br, \({}^{77}_{36}\)Kr, \({}^{77}_{37}\)Rb, \({}^{77}_{38}\)Sr, and \({}^{77}_{39}\)Y.

In this exceptional case, the division of the chains does not produce any significant error to the \({}^{77}_{35}\)Br  build-up (within a given range of typical exposure and cooling times) because its half-life is two orders of magnitude higher than half-lives of \({}^{77}_{36}\)Kr  and \({}^{77}_{35}\)Br.

## 5 Results

The activation was calculated for an extensive list of materials, assuming each time a single material for all detector components. For each of the 20 chemical elements and 1 composite material studied, the high-energy hadron and low-energy neutron activation were calculated and the sum of the two was plotted over the detector volume in form of 2D maps showing the \(\Sigma_{k}(\Delta_{k}/\mathrm{LE}_{k})\) isolines. Taking into account the location and material composition of a detector component and the maps for each of the materials, it is possible to understand whether the component will be activated to more than 1/10 of the exemption limit.

Extensive calculations were repeated for several different assumptions on irradiation and cooling times, and using different cross section sets:

* a complete list of materials using Silberberg-Tsao cross-sections for all the operation scenarios identified in section 3.2;
* a complete list of materials using the Rudstam formula for operation scenario (A1);
* a limited list of materials (Be, C, Al, Si, Cr, Mn, Fe, Ni, Cu) using the "best-estimate" compilation of cross-sections for scenarios (A1), (A2), (C1), (C2);
* for operating scenario (A1) only.

All the maps are now available from the "ATLAS Activation Web-page" [6]. Basic results for scenario (A1) are provided on figures 12-32 to show the difference of using Silberberg-Tsao, Rudstam, and the "best-estimate" sets of proton cross-sections.

Most ATLAS detector components will only become waste at the time of decommissioning of the LHC. Basic results are provided for 10 years of homogeneous irradiation, which corresponds to 10 years of LHC operation at a luminosity of \(10^{34}\) cm\({}^{\text{-2}}\) s\({}^{\text{-1}}\) for 120 days per year. Other operation scenarios were explored but it was found that the duration of the irradiation did not exert a strong influence on the zoning. The length of the cooling time, however, makes a large difference on the zoning.

Analysis of results for the baseline scenario (A1) shows that if only aluminum components would be of concern, the \(10^{\text{-1}}\) isoline of \(\Sigma_{k}(\Delta_{k}/\mathrm{LE}_{k})\), marking the radioactive waste zone, would reach a maximum radius of less than 3 meters at a distance of 3-4 m from the interaction point (and about 1 m beyond 3-4 m in Z). In the case of components made of nickel, the zone is larger, extending 4 meters at the location of this peak and including another broad peak, almost 5 meters in radius stretching between 6 and 13 meters from the interaction point. The second peak cuts through the End Cap Toroid. If one assumes that some components could have been made of pure cobalt, practically the whole cavern would fall within the radioactive waste zone. This is due to the low-energy neutron activation, particularly the reaction \({}^{59}\)Co(n, \(\gamma\))\({}^{60}\)Co. For most of the other materials (Fe, Cu, Pb, Au, Re, W, Sn, Nb, Mn, Cr, Ti, Si, C and Be) the zoning boundary lies below that of nickel. Only alloys with more than 0.1% (wt.) cobalt, 1% antimony, 10% zinc and 1% silver have zoning boundaries larger than nickel.

The basic sources of uncertainty that affect results of this study originate from the uncertainty of calculated fluxes and the activation cross-sections for high-energy hadrons. A parallel zoning study using full-scale FLUKA simulations was conducted to provide more assurance in definition of ATLAS zoning [33]. FLUKA results are in good agreement with comparable results of the present report.

## 6 Conclusions

The results of the present calculations served as a source material for the decision on the zoning of the ATLAS experiment. Other aspects influencing the decision were the expected irradiation conditions and cooling times that the detector will experience, the likelihood and time horizon in which a component might become waste, the physical boundaries of the components, and the need to prevent a large overestimation of the radioactive waste zone while ensuring that to the current best knowledge it includes all areas where radioactive waste may be produced.
