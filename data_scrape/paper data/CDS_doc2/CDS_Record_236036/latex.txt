## 1 Introduction

The primary task of the LHC is the Higgs boson search. If Higgs mass \(M_{H}>2M_{Z}\), than the main signature for its registration is \(H\to ZZ\to 4l^{\pm}\). This decay mode can give us the sufficient statistics at \(M_{H}<800~{}GeV\). For example, if \(M_{H}=800~{}GeV\) and we can identify electrons and muons, one can expect the 39 events of \(H\to ZZ\to 4l^{\pm}\) at the integral luminosity \(L_{int}=10^{5}~{}pb^{-1}\). The decay mode \(H\to ZZ\to l^{+}l^{-}\nu\bar{\nu}\) has branching ratio six times larger than the decay to charge leptons. This mode allows us to go to the mass of Higgs up to 900 GeV [1]. We can identify Z-boson, which decays into \(\nu\bar{\nu}\), using Jacobian peak in the \(p_{T}^{miss}\) distribution. The precision of the \(p_{T}^{miss}\) determination is quite enough in this case, using the central and end cup calorimeters only, that will cover the range of pseudorapidity \(-3<\eta<3\)[1]. But the production of single Z-boson accompanying with the jets can imitate large \(p_{T}^{miss}\), if one of the jets has \(|\eta|>3\). To suppress the background from Z+jets events one needs to increase \(|\eta|\) at least up to 4 [1].

The Higgs width increases with his mass: \(\Gamma_{H}\simeq 0.5~{}TeV(M_{H}/1~{}TeV)^{3}\) and, for example, \(\Gamma_{H}=0.5~{}TeV\) for \(M_{H}=1~{}TeV\). At such large width it is hard to find Higgs signal under the background caused the nonresonance ZZ-pairs. One can rise the signal/background ratio, if separate the process

\[qq\to qqB, \tag{1}\]that gives approximately the same contribution to the Higgs production as the process

\[gg\to H \tag{2}\]

at large \(M_{H}\). Tagging of one or two jets with \(p_{T}>50\ GeV/c\) and \(2.5<|\eta|<4.5\) from the process (1) leads to the suppression of the background [2].

The same problems arise in a search for the signal from t-quark and the supersymmetry particles. If the t-quark mass \(m_{t}>200\ GeV\), the noticeable contribution to its production is made by subprocess [3]

\[W^{+}g\to t\bar{b}, \tag{3}\]

where W-boson is radiated by the quark. It gives special kinematics with a spectator quark at large rapidity and \(p_{T}\sim M_{W}\)[3, 4]. The top mass can be reconstructed using its decay products: leptons (e or \(\mu\)), jet from b-quark and neutrino. The neutrino momentum comes from the kinematic equation, that connects \(p_{T}^{miss}\), lepton momentum and the known W-boson mass. If t-quark is produced by the process

\[pp\to t\bar{t}X, \tag{4}\]

its mass can also be reconstructed from lepton, b-jet and neutrino, when one t-quark decays semileptonically and another one decays hadronically [3, 5]. In the accuracy the top mass determination the \(p_{T}^{miss}\) resolution dominates and therefore it is very sensitive to the calorimetric coverage.

One of the supersymmetry signatures is the high \(p_{T}^{miss}\) and jets, because the lightest stable SUSY particle can not be detected. The QCD-jets events with one jet escapes calorimeters are the background for SUSY. To suppress the QCD background, one needs to enlarge the \(\eta\) coverage to \(|\eta|<4.5\)[6].

From all of that it follows, to determine \(p_{T}^{miss}\) the calorimeter has to cover the range of \(|\eta|\) up to 4.5 at least, and up to 5 for forward jets registration, if we take into account the finite size of jets. The central and end cup calorimeters of planed detector cover the \(\eta\) range from -3 to 3. Thus, the forward and backward calorimeters have to cover the range of \(|\eta|\) from 3 to 5. Below we consider requirements on the granularity \(\Delta_{\eta}\times\Delta_{\phi}\), the energy range of detected particles and the energy resolution \((\Delta E/E)=R/\sqrt{E}\) for the forward and backward calorimeters on the basis of the \(p_{T}^{miss}\) measurements and the jet reconstruction. For simplicity both forward and backward calorimeters will be referred to as forward one.

For calorimeter simulation we are not take into account the hadronic shower size. The influence of it on the results of a simulation is estimated in the appendix.

## 2 Missing Transverse Momentum Measurements

Let us consider the influence of forward calorimeter parameters on the precision of the \(p_{T}^{miss}\) reconstruction. As mentioned above the high precision measurement \(p_{T}^{miss}\) is needed for the t-quark mass determination in the decay mode \(t\) - \(\mu(e)\nu b\). For our analysis we use 5000 ISAJET events of single t-quark production with \(m_{t}=200~{}GeV\) in the decay mode \(t\to e\nu b\). The single t-quark production process is absent in the original version of ISAJET program. The relevant amendments have been introduced in that program. To follow the paper [3] subprocess (3) is replaced by the subprocess

\[bq\to tq^{\prime}, \tag{5}\]

where the W-boson radiation from a quark is taken into account in matrix element \(2\to 2\). b-quark is taken from the quark distribution function. \(b\)-pairs appear from gluons in the parton cascade, which is simulated in ISAJET program. This calculations approximate the calculations with full matrix element \(2\to 3\)[3, 4].

The events have the cut \(p_{T}^{e}>40~{}GeV/c\), that replace the respective condition on \(p_{T}^{miss}\). The central and end cup calorimeters parameters have been fixed and have the following values: granularity \(\Delta_{q}\times\Delta_{\phi}=0.05\times 0.05\); \(R_{m}=10\%\); \(R_{h}=50\%\); the minimal transverse energy of cell is \((E_{T}^{e})_{min}=0.1~{}GeV\). For quantitative estimation of the precision the particles total transverse momentum measurement using the calorimeters the variable:

\[\Delta p_{T}=<|\sum_{i}E_{T}^{i}-\sum_{cell}E_{T}^{e}\pi_{T}^{e}|>, \tag{6}\]

has been introduced, where the first sum runs over all particles passed through the calorimeter.

If one considers the central and end cup calorimeters only, then \(<p_{T}^{miss}>=67.1~{}GeV/c\) and the error in the definition of \(p_{T}^{e}\) is \(\Delta p_{T}^{e}=<|p_{T}^{e}-p_{T}^{miss}|>=30.8~{}GeV/c\). The main part of this error comes from the particles with \(|\eta|>3\). They have the average total transverse momentum equal to \(28.3~{}GeV/c\). The calorimeter's error part is equal to \(\Delta p_{T}=9.12~{}GeV/c\). It can be reduced to 4.93 GeV/c, if one does not include the neutrino from c- and b-decays into the sum. The particles with \(|\eta|>5\) have the average total transverse momentum equal to 9.0 Gev/c. Therefore the error in determination of the neutrino transverse momentum may be reduced, if the forward calorimeters with \(\Delta p_{T}\sim\) a few GeV/c will be added.

Fig. 2.1\(+\)2.3 show the dependences \(\Delta p_{T}\) versus granularity, hadron energy resolution, \((E_{T}^{e})_{min}\), respectively, for forward calorimeter. The neutrino from c- and b-quark decays is not included. Their contribution to \(\Delta p_{T}\) is about \(0.1+0.2~{}GeV/c\). Since the precision of the energy measurements in the e.m.

calorimeter has a small influence on \(\Delta p_{T}\), \(R_{em}\) was everywhere fixed 20%. To study the contribution of error in determination \(p_{T}^{\rm c}\) on the width of t-quark signal, the \(M_{\rm e\star}\) distribution was obtained. For this calculation we used the precise values for the e and b momentum, because the \(\Delta p_{T}^{\rm c}\) contribution dominates in the width [3]. The distributions were fitted by a Breit-Wigner function with a background. The background resulting from a false choice of the sign in the equation, which defines \(p_{L}^{\rm c}\) and has two solutions. We used both of them, as ref. [5]. The solution having lower value \(|p_{L}^{\rm c}|\) was used in ref. [3, 4]. The calculations have shown that the widths coincide with the precision of the fitting errors in both cases. The values of \(\Delta p_{T}^{\rm c}\) and \(\Gamma\) are shown in Table 2.1 for some parameter sets. As follows from the figures and the table if we take the parameters values: \(\Delta_{\eta}\times\Delta_{\phi}=0.2\times 0.2\), \(R_{\rm h}=100\%\), \((E_{T}^{\rm c})_{min}=0.1\ GeV/c\), then the \(\Delta p_{T}\) is equal about 1 GeV/c and has no the noticable influence on \(\Delta p_{T}^{\rm c}\) and \(\Gamma\). If the calorimeters with very rough granularity as \(0.5\times 0.5\) will be used, then the value of \(\Delta p_{T}^{\rm c}\) and \(\Gamma\), respectively, increases on about \(1+2\ GeV\) only. Even in this case \(m_{t}\) resolution will be much better then without the forward calorimeters.

At pair t-quark production, when one t-quark decays in the semileptonic mode, as other one - in the hadronic mode, the relevant values change about \(10+20\%\). For example, at \(t\)-pair production with \(m_{t}=150\ GeV<p_{T}^{miss}>=80.0\ GeV/c\) and the average total hadron transverse momentum with \(|\eta|>3\) is equal to \(24.8\ GeV/c\). The event became in this case more central and the contribution of forward calorimeters into the error of the \(p_{T}^{\rm c}\) has to be less.

## 3 Jet Analysis

As mentioned above, we have interested of jets with \(p_{T}>50\ GeV/c\) and \(2.5<|\eta|<4.5\). To study this jets we used 1000 TWOJET events from ISAJET with \(p_{T}^{\rm c}=100\ GeV/c\). The precision of jet reconstruction depends from the jet vector position relatively to the cell centre. To average this dependence, \(\eta\) of jets has been simulated from 3.5 to 4.5. For every event the ratio of the measured transverse momentum of jet to its exact value - \(\xi(p_{T})\) and the ratio of the measured energy of jet to its exact value - \(\xi(E)\) have been calculated.

We considered two type of calorimeters: one with the granularity - \(0.2\times 0.2\) and another one with the rough granularity - \(0.5\times 0.5\). The energy resolution in both cases was determined by parameters: \(R_{em}=20\%\) and \(R_{\rm h}=100\%\). For calorimeter with the granularity \(0.2\times 0.2\) the jets were reconstructed with the help of the CDF jet finding algorithm [7]. For calorimeter with the rough granularity the cell size is about the cone radius of jets therefore other algorithm for jet reconstruction is needed. We used the cluster algorithm. The cell with maximum \(E_{T}\) was chosen, then the connected set of the cells including chosen one with \(E_{T}^{\rm c}>E_{T}^{\rm cut}\) forms the cluster.

For the search of the Higgs boson with high mass the luminosity up to 2 \(10^{24}\ cm^{-2}s^{-1}\) is needed. At this luminosity there are about 20 inelastic ppinteractions in each bunch crossing. We mixed the considered event with \(n_{MB}\) MINIBIAS-events and \(n_{T}\), TWOJET events with \(p_{T}^{est}>3\ GeV/c\) in order to simulate the pile-up. The quantities \(n_{MB}\) and \(n_{TJ}\) were Poisson simulated with the average value of 10.

The average values of \(\xi\) with the r.m.s. errors are shown in Tables 3.1+3.4 for the events without pile-up and for the events with pile-up. One can see that the precision of \(p_{T}\) and E determination is equal to \(10+20\%\) and sufficient for our aims. For the calorimeter with cell size of \(0.2\times 0.2\), when CDF-algorithm was used, the optimal value of \(R_{j}=1.0\) for the events without pile-up and \(R_{j}=0.5\) for the events with pile-up and the parameter \((E_{T}^{est})_{min}=0.1+0.3\ GeV/c\). In the cluster algorithm the value \(E_{T}^{est}\) is chosen from the condition \(E_{T}^{est}>C_{T}^{est}>\). For the calorimeter with the cell size of \(0.5\times 0.5\) for TWOJET events without pile-up \(<E_{T}^{est}>=3.69\) and with pile-up \(<E_{T}^{est}>=5.63\). The increasing of the \(E_{T}^{est}\) makes worse the \(p_{T}\) and E jet resolution, but the algorithm reliability makes higher and the probability to find the fake jet from background particles is coming less. For example, the particles from the soft pile-up events make the clusters with \(p_{T}<40\ GeV/c\) and \(E<700\ GeV\) at \(E_{T}^{est}=10.0\ Gev/c\) in 100%.

## 4 Conditions for Calorimeter Events

Let's consider the calorimeter having \(0.2\times 0.2\) granularity which is placed on 14 m distance from the intersection point. Figs. 4.1 + 4.3 show the average numbers of particles per cell, average particle energy and average transverse energy, respectively, vs. distance from calorimeter center. It's done for Higgs production and \(\bar{H}\to Z\bar{Z}\to l^{+}l^{-}\nu\bar{\nu}\) decay. Figs. 4.4 + 4.6 show the similar dependence for MINIBIAS-events and TWOJET-events having \(p_{T}^{est}>3\ GeV/c\).

For events with jets having \(p_{T}=100\ GeV/c\) and \(\eta=4\) we show the distributions as follow: Fig.4.7 - the number of particle per cell; Fig.4.8 - the minimal energy per cell if the transverse energy threshold is equal to \(0.1\ GeV/c\); Fig.4.9 - the distribution for maximum number of particle per cell; Fig.4.10 - the maximum energy per cell; Fig.4.11 - the maximum transverse energy per cell.

## 5 Conclusion

We considered here the influence the forward calorimeter parameters on the missing transverse momentum measurements and to the jet reconstruction. We show that working at highest luminosity \(L=2\ 10^{34}\ cm^{-2}s^{-1}\) the calorimeter having a granularity up to \(\Delta_{\eta}\times\Delta_{\phi}=0.5\times 0.5\), the energy resolution \((\Delta E/E)_{em}=20\%/\sqrt{\bar{E}}\), \((\Delta E/E)_{h}=100\%/\sqrt{E}\) let us to measure the \(p_{T}^{miss}\) with good precision and to determine the transverse momentum and the energy of jets with the accuracy \(10+20\%\).

## 6 Appendix: Estimation of the influence of the hadronic shower size on the calorimeter simulation

Usually for the simple calorimeter simulation the size of the hadronic showers is not taken into account, i.e. the cell is assigned the all energy of the hadron which hits it. For the forward calorimeter the cell size will be compatible with the hadronic shower size or smaller than it. For example, the calorimeter with granularity \(0.2\times 0.2\) and standing at 16 m from the interaction point has the cells with size from 4.8 cm to 29.1 cm in radial direction, as the hadron shower size is equal about 20 cm. To estimate the influence of the hadronic shower size on the calorimeter simulation we spreaded the hadronic energy over the cells according to the transverse distribution of the energy in the shower. The transverse distribution of the energy in the shower was taken from paper [8], where the showers from the 150 GeV pions in the lead/scintillator fiber calorimeter is studied. It has the form

\[rf(r)=B_{1}e^{-r/\lambda_{1}}+B_{2}e^{-r^{2}/\lambda_{1}^{2}}, \tag{7}\]

where \(\lambda_{1}=14.5\ cm\), \(B_{1}=2.82\), \(\lambda_{2}=3.88\ cm\), \(B_{2}=15.0\). The calorimeter axes ds standing from the shower centre on distance r is assigned the energy \(f(r)\)ds. The distribution (7) was used for all the hadron type. The energy dependence of the parameters \(\lambda_{1}\) and \(\lambda_{2}\) is small and it was neglected. The constants \(B_{1}\) and \(B_{2}\) was renormalised in dependence of the hadron energy. The cell energy is equal to the integral of the distribution over the cell area. We integrated over the cell \(c_{0}\), which is hit by the hadron and over the neighbour cells \(c_{1},...,c_{8}\) (see Fig. 1). The rest of the energy was shared among the cells \(c_{0},...,c_{20}\), the each cell got the energy proportionally the energy of the respectively adjacent to it cell \(c_{1},...,c_{8}\). Apparently, this approximation works well when the main part of the hadron energy is got by the cells \(c_{0},...,c_{8}\).

Fig. 2 shows the precision the particles total transverse momentum measurement using the forward calorimeter \(\Delta p_{T}\) (see section 2) calculated with account of the shower size and without it in dependence from the calorimeter granularity \(\Delta\). For interested us value \(\Delta>0.2\) the influence of the shower size on \(\Delta p_{T}\) is small. At \(\Delta=0.5\ \Delta p_{T}\) decreases about 5%. The improvement of the precision the particles total transverse momentum measurement is explained by that the determination \(\tau\) and \(\phi\) of a particle as the average over several cells is better than as the centre of one cell. For \(\Delta=0.5\) our approximation works very well, because the part of the hadron energy fall in the cells \(c_{0},...,c_{8}\) is equal in the average to 97%, for \(\Delta=0.2\) it equal to 0.89%.

The precision of the jet transverse momentum determination is not practically changes, if one take into account the shower size. For example, for thecalorimeter with granularity \(0.2\times 0.2\) and with parameters of CDF algorithm \(R_{j}=1.0\) and \((E_{T}^{\pm})_{min}=0.1\ GeV\ \xi(p_{T})=0.979\pm 0.090\) (for comparison see Table 3.1) and for the calorimeter with granularity \(0.5\times 0.5\) and the transverse energy threshold per cell \(E_{T}^{est}=5.0\ GeV\ \xi(p_{T})=0.887\pm 0.127\) (for comparison see Table 3.3). The precision of the jet energy determination is some worse: \(\xi(E)\) is equal to \(0.949\pm 0.102\) and \(0.838\pm 0.116\), respectively.

Thus, taking into account the hadronic shower size for the calorimeter granularity \(\Delta>0.2\) has small influence on the determination of the missing transverse momentum and on the reconstruction of the jets for the forward calorimeter.
