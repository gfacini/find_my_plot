**Abstract**

\(b\)-jets can be identified by taking advantage of the presence of a muon coming from the semi-leptonic decay of the \(b\) hadrons. This note describes a soft muon tagging algorithm and its performance when applied to different Monte Carlo physics samples in ATLAS. A \(b\)-jet tagging efficiency of about 10% (including the inclusive \(b\rightarrow\mu\nu X\) branching ratio of \(\approx 20\%\)) is achieved for a light jet rejection of better than 300. The effect of pile-up events and cavern background on the performance is also considered and is found to be significant but manageable.

Introduction

Soft-lepton tagging relies on the semi-leptonic decays of \(b\) and \(c\) hadrons. Indeed the presence of a muon is enhanced in \(b\)-jets thanks to the significant semi-leptonic decay branching ratio of \(b\) hadrons (\(BR(b\to\mu\nu X)\approx 11\%\)), and of \(c\) hadrons produced by the \(b\) hadron decay (sequential semi-leptonic decay, \(BR(b\to c\to\mu\nu X)\approx 10\%\)). A soft muon tagger, while intrinsically limited by the small semi-leptonic branching ratio, offers a good alternative or complement to the more performant lifetime taggers. Thanks to its good purity and low correlation with lifetime taggers, it can be used to do cross-calibrations of the two types of tagger [1], or to enhance the lifetime tagger performance by combining the two. Finally, it permits derivation of specific jet energy corrections [2].

The properties of the soft muons and of the various backgrounds are shown in Section 2. The algorithm is then described in detail in Section 3 while its performance applied to different Monte Carlo samples is discussed in Section 4.

## 2 Properties of muons from semi-leptonic decays and their backgrounds

There are three sources of background from particles within light jets: muons coming from the decay of light hadrons (mostly pions), hadrons managing to go through the calorimeter and reaching the muon spectrometer ("punch-through"), and hits caused by the neutron gas that will be surrounding the detector during data taking, producing fake tracks in the muon spectrometer ("cavern background"). \(c\)-jets are also a source of background as far as \(b\)-tagging is concerned. Figures 1, 2, 3, and 4 show, respectively, the distance to the closest jet \(\Delta R=\sqrt{\eta^{2}+\phi^{2}}\), the muon transverse momentum, the impact parameter, and the transverse momentum relative to the closest jet axis \(p_{T}^{rel}\), for muons from (direct) \(b\) decays, sequential \(b\to c\to\mu\nu X\) decays, \(c\) decay, light hadron decays, and fake muons, in jets of \(E_{T}>15\)GeV and \(|\eta|<2.5\) in \(t\bar{t}\) events. \(p_{T}^{rel}\) is defined as the muon momentum in the plane orthogonal to the jet axis, where the jet axis is corrected for the presence of a muon by adding the muon momentum to the jet momentum. Contributions from true muons are estimated at the generator level while fake muons are estimated with the full simulation and defined as a reconstructed muon associated with a jet while no muon of momentum larger than 2 GeV was found at the generator level within \(\Delta R=0.6\) of that same jet. Note that the distinction between fake muons and muons from light hadron decays is somewhat arbitrary since the latter can also be produced in the calorimeter as part of the hadronic shower; such muons are present in the full simulation but are not distinguished from fake muons because long-lived particles and showers are taken care of by GEANT and the full GEANT information was not available in the present study. Muons produced by direct \(b\) hadron decays have a significantly larger transverse momentum than the various backgrounds, especially muons from light hadron decays; additionally, since light hadrons such as charged pions and charged kaons have a long lifetime, those muons tend to have a large impact parameter. Those two properties will be used to reject this important background efficiently. Thanks to the \(b\) hadrons high mass, muons from direct \(b\) decays tend to be more boosted in a plane transverse to the jet axis, _i.e._ have a larger \(p_{T}^{rel}\) than the backgrounds. This property is used in the tagger to further separate \(b\)-jets from light jets through a likelihood technique. It is important to note that muons from sequential \(b\) decay are much more difficult to separate from background since they have a much softer spectrum both in \(p_{T}\) and \(p_{T}^{rel}\) than those from direct \(b\) decay. Finally, Fig. 5 shows that the \(p_{T}^{rel}\) distribution in \(t\bar{t}\) and \(WH\) events is very similar. Indeed the \(p_{T}^{rel}\) variable is not very correlated with the jet \(E_{T}\) or pseudo-rapidity. Thus it is not very dependent on the process producing the \(b\)-jets.

* Finally, a 1-dimensional likelihood ratio using the \(p_{T}^{rel}\) variable discriminates further signal from background.

### Muon reconstruction

Two complementary muon reconstruction algorithms are used by the soft-muon tagger: so-called "combined" muons, which correspond to a track fully reconstructed in the muon spectrometer and matched with a track in the inner detector; and "tagged" muons, which cannot reach the muon middle and outer stations and are identified by matching an inner detector track with a segment in the muon inner stations only. The ATLAS muon spectrometer is able to fully reconstruct muons of momentum larger than about 5 GeV, providing a precise measurement of its momentum, allowing - in combination with the inner detector track - a very good rejection of the combinatoric background in the dense environment of jets. Muon spectrometer tracks that fail to be combined with an inner detector track are not used by the soft-muon tagger because of the contamination from fakes and muons from light hadron decays. Tagged muons are less pure than combined muons but allow one to recover some efficiency in the crucial low momentum range. Thus both combined muons and tagged muons are used by the soft-muon tagger. For more details of muon reconstruction and identification, see Ref. [3].

### Jet-muon association and basic selection

Muons are associated with the closest jet (in \(\eta\times\phi\)) in the event (only jets with \(E_{T}>15\) GeV and \(|\eta|<2.5\) are considered) and the jet-muon pair is required to satisfy \(\Delta R(\text{jet-muon})<0.5\). Additionally, muons are required to satisfy the following requirements:

* \(p_{T}>4\) GeV

### Likelihood ratio

Muons from semi-leptonic \(b\)-decays are further separable because of their particular kinematics. As shown in Section 1, the muon transverse momentum relative to the jet (\(p_{T}^{rel}\)) is a good discriminant variable, and it is used in a likelihood ratio to discriminate between the \(b\) and light jet hypotheses. No attempt was made to specifically discriminate between \(b\)- and \(c\)-jets. The \(p_{T}^{rel}\) probability density functions were estimated on fully simulated \(t\bar{t}\) and \(WH\rightarrow\mu\nu b\bar{b}/WH\rightarrow\mu\nu u\bar{u}\) samples of several hundred thousand events and are shown in Fig. 6 and 7 for tagged and for combined muons separately. Here pile-up and cavern background are omitted. The normalized variable \(p_{T}^{rel}/(p_{T}^{rel}+0.5\,GeV)\) is used instead of \(p_{T}^{rel}\) in order to facilitate the smoothing of the probability density functions. The likelihood is found to be less discriminating for tagged muons than for combined muons because muons at low momentum tend to be produced by \(b\to c\rightarrow\mu X\) sequential decays, which also tend to yield a smaller \(p_{T}^{rel}\) as shown in the previous section. This is visible in the probability density function as a second peak at a value of \(\approx 0.5\) (compared to \(\approx 0.7\) for direct \(b\rightarrow\mu X\) decays).

Each likelihood is normalized with the probability (estimated on the same fully simulated samples) that a reconstructed muon be associated with a jet of a given flavor. For each type of reconstructed muon (tagged or combined), the likelihood ratio \(Q\) can be written as follows:

\[Q=\frac{\epsilon_{b}^{0}\times L(p_{T}^{rel}|b)}{\epsilon_{l}^{0}\times L(p_{T }^{rel}|l)}\]

where \(\epsilon_{b}^{0}\) (\(\epsilon_{l}^{0}\)) is the fraction of \(b\)-jets (light jets) that contain a muon satisfying the basic selection and \(L(p_{T}^{rel}|b)\) (\(L(p_{T}^{rel}|l)\)) is the probability density function for a \(b\)-jet (light jet). It was found that \(\epsilon_{b}^{0}/\epsilon_{l}^{0}\approx 6.6\)

Figure 6: Probability density function used in the algorithm likelihood for the \(p_{T}^{rel}\) variable, for the tagged muons.

for tagged muons and \(\epsilon_{b}^{0}/\epsilon_{l}^{0}\approx 44.4\) for combined muons, reflecting the fact that combined muons are purer and contribute to a large fraction of the efficiency.

Several muons can be associated with a jet. In such a case, the muon with highest transverse momentum is considered. At this point, no attempt has been made to use the information given by the presence of an additional muon in the jet.

## 4 Performance

The algorithm performance was estimated on \(t\bar{t}\) and \(WH\to\mu\nu b\bar{b}/WH\to\mu\nu u\bar{u}\) Monte Carlo samples of several hundred thousand events. The jet flavor is determined at the generator level by matching reconstructed jets with quarks considered after final state radiation (for details, see Ref. [4]). Figures 8 and 9 show the \(b\)-tagging efficiency and the light jet tagging rate, respectively, with and without a cut on the likelihood ratio, as a function of jet \(E_{T}\) and pseudorapidity in \(t\bar{t}\) events. An average \(b\)-tagging efficiency of 10% is reached for a cut on the likelihood ratio of \(lnQ>3.05\), which corresponds to rejecting all tagged muons and selecting combined muons with \(p_{T}^{rel}>360\) MeV. No requirement on the \(b\) decay is made, so that the \(b\)-tagging efficiency includes the semi-leptonic branching ratios as well as the jet-muon association efficiency, the detector acceptance, and the muon reconstruction efficiency and selection. Likewise, the light jet tagging rate includes both light hadron decay muons and fake muons. The \(b\)-tagging efficiency tends to decrease as the jet \(E_{T}\) increases, mostly because of a drop in the tracking efficiency of the inner detector in highly collimated jets. Not surprisingly, the light jet tagging rate increases significantly with the jet \(E_{T}\). After the basic selection stage, light hadron decays account for 8% (1.6%) of combined muons (tagged muons) present in tagged light jets in \(t\bar{t}\) events.

Figures 10 and 11 show the \(b\)-tagging efficiency vs light jet rejection (the inverse of the light jet tagging rate) for different cuts on the likelihood ratio. Figure 10 compares the performance in \(t\bar{t}\) and \(WH\) events. The rejection for a given efficiency is slightly better in \(t\bar{t}\) events than in \(WH\) events, due to the fact that jets in \(t\bar{t}\) events are more central, while the tagger performance is degraded in the forward region of the detector. The soft-muon tagger reaches a rejection of about 300 in \(WH\) events and 380 in \(t\bar{t}\) events

for an efficiency of 10%.

Figure 11 shows the effect of pile-up (the superposition of several events occuring within the same bunch crossing) and cavern background on the tagger performance. Here, only jets matched to the hard-scatter process quarks are considered in order to make a fair comparison of the algorithm performance with and without cavern background and pile-up. Indeed, soft jets from pile-up events tend to have a lower light jet tagging rate and would bias the comparison. For a luminosity of \(2\times 10^{33}\)cm\({}^{-2}\cdot\)s\({}^{-1}\), pile-up and cavern background decrease the rejection by about 15% (for a given efficiency of 10%), which is significant but not dramatic.

Performance will have to be evaluated in data, using techniques similar to those developed at the Tevatron [5]. The muon reconstruction efficiency can be measured using a tag-and-probe method applied to \(J/\psi\) and \(Z\) samples. The light jet tagging rate may be measured using jet events, although disentangling background from heavy-flavor muons is a complex issue. Jet samples may also be used to test the likelihood probability distribution functions against data. Those issues have not been studied in the context of soft muon tagging in ATLAS yet.

## 5 Conclusion

The soft-muon tagger developped for the ATLAS detector shows excellent performance across a large jet \(E_{T}\) spectrum, with a light jet rejection of more than 300 for a \(b\)-tagging efficiency of 10%. The event pile-up and the cavern background appear to have a significant but not dramatic effect on the performance, with a decrease of about 15% on the light jet rejection at a luminosity of \(2\times 10^{33}\)cm\({}^{-2}\cdot\)s\({}^{-1}\).
