###### Abstract

The work presents the technology of thin carbon-carbon composite shells. Composites produced using Thornel P-100 high- modulus fibers were irradiated with gamma rays and neutrons. The influence of irradiation on flexural modulus was studied. The results indicate that the doses \(10Mrad\) and \(6.1\cdot 10^{16}n/cm^{2}\) of gamma rays and neutrons, respectively, cause a slight increase in elastic properties of the material studied.

Composites produced from carbon matrix and reinforced by carbon fibers form a class of materials which, on the one hand, have good properties typical of carbon and graphite and, on the other hand, show enhanced mechanical properties due to the synergy between the fibers and the matrix [1, 2, 3]. The superiority of these materials in comparison with the traditional ones results from the possibility of shaping their structure in a controlled way - from an amorphous one to a highly crystalline structure characteristic of graphite. It is possible to shape their chemical and physical properties by choosing various carbon matrix precursors (phenol resins, pitches, pyrolitic carbon obtained by Chemical Vapour Deposition method), various reinforcing carbon fibers (high-strength, high-modulus), various geometries of reinforcement and thermal treatment conditions [4, 5]. Common features distinguishing carbon materials are the following [6, 7, 8]:

* high resistance to thermal shock resulting from low values of thermal expansion coefficient and high heat conduction,
* invariability of mechanical properties at high temperatures,
* chemical resistance in non-oxidizing environment,
* low density.

The presence of fibers in a composite material enhances its strength and the values of respective moduli, increases its crack resistance and fatigue strength which is very important in structural applications [9, 10]. Another important property of carbon materials is their good resistance to radiation and bombardment by high-energy particles which makes it possible to use them in building nuclear reactors [11, 12]. However, the interaction mechanism is well known only for solid, polycrystalline graphite and pyrographite [13, 14]. In this case the bombardment causes a change of linear dimensions, a decrease in heat conduction and an increase in strength and modulus of elasticity. Electrical and optical properties can be also changed as a result of irradiation [15]. In the case of carbon-carbon composites the presence of several carbon phases with different microstructure, interfacial boundaries and the anisotropy of material properties can result in different behavior than for solid graphite. The investigations reported by Bullock et al [16] showed that after irradiation with fast neutrons carbon-carbon composite changed its value of the interlaminar shear strength (ILSS). As a result, the mechanism of cracking as well as the stress-strain curve were changed. Other studies [17, 18, 19] showed that irradiation with neutrons increased the Young's modulus of both high strength and high modulus carbon fibers. The improvement of elasticity was about 10%. This was attributed to an increase in shear modulus of the graphite parallel to the basal planes. According to Wick et al [18], as a consequence of fast neutron irradiation the Young's modulus increased initially, but a prolonged exposure resulted in degradation of fibers, causing a lowering of the Young's modulus. The dose at which the maximum value of modulus was obtained increased if the temperature of earlier heat treatment was higher. The increase in modulus at low doses of irradiation has been attributed to a decrease in mobility of basal dislocations. At higher doses the Young's modulus decreases due to the increase in dislocation density and misalignment of graphite layers.

The increasing array of applications of c/c composites includes new fields where light, stable and stiff materials are required. Among possible applications are supporting structures for particle detectors in the latest accelerators [20, 21]. An acceptable material for a detector must combine several properties which no single material can provide. The most important of the required properties are as follows:

* very high specific Young's modulus,
* long radiation length,
* radiation resistant,
* low coefficient of thermal expansion,
* low coefficient of moisture expansion and moisture absorption,
* high coefficient of thermal conductivity.

The best supporting structure of a detector, especially close to a collision point, is a thin shell made of a light and very stiff material. One of the few materials which can meet the above requirements to a significant degree is carbon-carbon composite based on high-modulus fibers. This paper presents the results of the research on the feasibility of manufacturing thin shell structural elements made of c/c composites. Technology of stiff c/c composite elements is discussed. The influence of gamma-ray and neutron irradiation on mechanical properties of a composite is also presented.

## 2 Materials and methods

Carbon-carbon composites were made of medium- and high-modulus carbon fibers and phenol-formaldehyde resin as carbon matrix precursor. The first step in the production of carbon-carbon composite was to form a single layer prepreg with unidirectional arrangement of fibers infiltrated with the solution of phenol-formaldehyde resin and ethyl alcohol. At the second stage the appropriately cut layers of prepreg were put into forms and pressed at about \(170^{o}C\). The properties of carbon fibers used in manufacturing c/c composites are given in Table 1.

The flexural strength and flexural modulus of composite samples were measured using a three-point bending test at the condition that \(l/d>16\), where "\(|\)" is a distance between the supports and "d" is a thickness of a sample. The loads used in the measurements of flexural modulus were \(0.5N\), \(1N\) or \(3N\). Because the samples had various lengths and also because of the observed dependence of Young's modulus value on the support span, the measurements were carried out at several spans, i.e. at \(40mm\), \(60mm\), \(80mm\) and \(100mm\). In addition, the velocities of ultrasonic wave propagation parallel and perpendicular to the sample long axis were measured using a materials tester MT-541 (head frequency \(0.5\)MHz) [22]. For anisotropic and non-homogeneous materials a correct determination of the values of elasticity constants from such measurements is not possible. We use here the values of ultrasonic wave propagation velocity qualitatively, to detect any changes in elastic properties of a composite studied. In order to determine the changes in open porosity resulting from the impregnation process porosity measurements were performed using Carlo Erba apparatus.

## 3 Discussion of the results

The preliminary studies [23] of fibers volume fraction, Young's modulus and the velocity of ultrasonic wave propagation performed for thin shells made of carbon-carbon and carbon fiber (AGH-IWCE)-phenolic resin composites have shown that the best structural properties could be obtained for the so-called three-layer laminate 0/90/0 (cross-ply laminate) (see Table 2). Such arrangement of the fibers ensures good cohesiveness of a composite. According to beam theory for a multilayer composite the values of the flexural modulus for such a material are only slightly lower ( by about 4% ) than those for a 1D composite, i.e. such composite where the fibers are arranged along the same direction in all three layers. In other words, the value of the flexural modulus for a three layer laminate 0/90/0 is slightly lower than for a single layer in the direction of fibers. Using carbon tissue instead of roving results in significant lowering of mechanical properties ( Table 2 ). The obtained results encouraged further studies on 2D composites reinforced with various types of fibers. As is known from the theory of composites, the ultimate high value of Young's modulus of a composite depends mainly on the value of Young's modulus of the fibers and their orientation with respect to the direction of acting stresses [24, 25]. Therefore for further studies high-modulus P-100 fibers obtained from mesophase pitches were used. Composites with these fibers display favorable mechanical properties which results not only from the fibers' properties alone but also from their adhesion at the fiber-carbon matrix precursor phase boundary.

As is seen from Table 1, composite P-100 fiber - phenolic resin has the lowest value of interlaminar shear strength. Due to that, during carbonization there appear mechanisms which are able to absorb additional elastic energy produced as a result of precursor shrinkage. In the case of composites with the T-300 fibers the situation is different. Due to a high concentration of surface functional groups (see Table 1) those fibers form a strong bonding with phenolic resin which is demonstrated by significant lowering of composite flexural strength after carbonization (see Table 2) in comparison with the appropriate value for c-c composite with P-100 fibers (see Table 3).

Other important factors influencing the ultimate properties of carbon-carbon composite are the method and conditions of impregnation process. The commonest methods of c/c composite densification are liquid impregnation with resins or pitches and the method of chemical vapour deposition [26, 27] however, a liquid impregnation method requires mechanical treatment each time after the densification process. This is very difficult for thin, very stiff and brittle elements. Therefore CVD process was used which, among others, ensures good reproducibility of the results and a short time of densification. As a result of densification with pyrocarbon the composite flexural strength increases. This is caused mainly by a decrease in open porosity (Table 3) and an increase in adhesion between the fiber and matrix. Pore-size distributions determined by mercury porosimetry method indicate a partial elimination of open pores with bigger sizes (Fig.1, Fig.2). As a consequence, mean pore-size decreases from \(1700\,nm\) to \(900\,nm\). The increase in adhesion at the phase boundary is confirmed by the change of the cracking mechanism. The observation of fractures indicates a brittle failure of a composite impregnated with pyrocarbon.

## 4 The results of the studies performed before and after irradiation.

In order to investigate a three-layer composite \(0/90/0\) reinforced with P-100 fibers 27 samples having the dimensions \(160\,mm\,x\,14\,mm\,x\,0.44\,mm\) were produced. The aim of the studies was to investigate the stability of mechanical properties and to determine the influence of irradiation by gamma rays and neutrons. The samples were manufactured according to the technology described above. Nine samples were additionally subjected to graphitization process at the temperature of \(2150^{o}C\). In the beginning the flexural modulus was measured at the span equal to \(100\,mm\). However, for the experiments with the irradiation of the samples their length had to be reduced to \(50\,mm\). For those samples the flexural modulus was measured again, this time with the distance between the supports equal to \(40\,mm\).

All the samples were also studied by ultrasonic method. Mean values of moduli and mean velocities of ultrasonic wave propagation together with the respective confidence intervals determined for confidence level of 0.95 are gathered in Table 4. Mean value of flexural modulus obtained from the three-point bending test at span equal to \(100\,mm\) is higher by about \(12\%\) than the mean value obtained at \(40\,mm\). Those results together with the results of additional series performed at \(60\,mm\) and \(80\,mm\) indicate that there is a relation between flexural modulus value and the distance between the supports (Fig.4). In all measurements the condition \(l/d>16\) is always fulfilled. Similar dependence of flexural modulus on the sample size for a three-layered laminate with different fiber arrangement, namely \((0,\pm 45)\), was presented in [28].

### Gamma rays irradiation.

Nine graphitized and nine non-graphitized samples having the dimensions \(50\,mm\,x\,14\,mm\,x\,0.44\,mm\) were irradiated by gamma rays at the Center of Oncology in Krakow. Gammatron-S Siemens apparatus with cobalt Co60 as a source of gamma radiation was used. The samples were irradiated gradually, in 6 irradiations lasting about 4 hours each, during 2 months. Dose rate was \(7130\,rad/min\). The total dose was 10 Mrad which corresponds to the estimated dose which will be absorbed by structural elements of inner detector in ATLAS project during 10 years of the experiment. The dose absorbed by the samples was measured using IONEX DOSEMASTER dosimeter and parallel plate ionization chamber 639. The dose was determined with the accuracy of \(\pm 10\%\). After the fourth, fifth and sixth irradiation the measurements of flexural modulus and of the velocity of longitudinal wave propagation were performed. The results of the measurements are presented in Figure 5.

On the basis of these results one can conclude that in the studied range of radiation doses, slight changes of elastic properties of composites were detected. An increase (about 7%) in flexural modulus could be observed for graphitized c/c composites. The results indicate that both high-modulus P-100 fibers and carbon matrix are resistant to gamma radiation if a total dose does not exceed \(10\,Mrad\).

### Irradiation with neutrons.

Similarly to the experiments with gamma rays, nine graphitized and nine non-graphitized samples were irradiated by neutrons. The experiments were carried out in the Institute of Atomic Energy at Otwock-Swierk, Poland. The samples were placed in tight aluminum container together with Au, Co, Ni activation foils which were used for the measurement of neutrons fluence. The samples were irradiated twice at two weeks interval and the doses of fast neutrons were equal to \(1.1\cdot 10^{14}\,n/cm^{2}\) and \(6.1\cdot 10^{14}\,n/cm^{2}\) respectively. Table 5 gives the neutrons fluence measured during the first irradiation.

After each irradiation the measurements of flexural modulus by \(\iota\) three-point bending test and of the velocity of longitudinal wave propagation were performed. Like in the case of gamma ray irradiation neither Young's modulus nor ultrasonic wave velocity were changed significantly after the irradiation with the doses used in the present study (see Figure 6).

## 5 Conclusions

The paper describes the technology of producing thin-shell elements from carbon-carbon composites. It presents also the results of the studies of their mechanical properties. The results are gathered in Table 6. On the basis of the results obtained for graphitized and non-graphitized samples it seems that keeping a sample at the temperature of \(2150^{\circ}C\) does not cause any significant change of the value of a flexural modulus. Earlier observations for medium-modulus carbon fibers reported in [29] might indicate that such heat treatment results in a certain increase of its value. Irradiation with gamma rays or neutrons where the doses were equal to \(10\,Mrad\) and \(6.1\cdot 10^{16}\,n/cm^{2}\) respectively, caused slight changes of the elastic properties of composite samples. The enhancement does not exceed several percent of the respective values before irradiation. So, one can state that c/c composites made of ultra-high modulus fibers behave similarly to those made of medium-modulus fibers [16].

It is worthwhile to stress that composite materials are very useful in high energy physics applications because they meet many demanding requirements. They can withstand the radiation doses which are expected in detectors [30]. They can be produced in the form of thin elements. The values of two parameters, i.e. EX (Young's modulus and radiation length product) and \(E/\rho\) (specific Young's modulus) are high enough :

\[EX=91\,GPa\cdot m E/\rho=211\,GPa\cdot cm^{3}/g\]

For comparison the values of those parameters for beryllium which is one of the best materials for similar applications are as follows:

\[EX=109\,GPa\cdot m E/\rho=168\,GPa\cdot cm^{3}/g\]Beryllium is a very expensive material because it requires special precautions to tackle the safety problems. Its processing is very harmful to people and environment.

To be acceptable as a material for purposes mentioned above this composite should also have good heat conductivity and a very small thermal expansion coefficient. Systematic studies of those properties as well as of electrical conductivity and humidity absorption are under way and their results will be presented soon.
