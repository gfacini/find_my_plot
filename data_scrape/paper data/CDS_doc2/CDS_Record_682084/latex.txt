# Energy Sharing in the Atlas EM Calorimeter

## 1 Introduction

The energy lost in the liquid Argon by charged particles is measured _via_ the characteristic signal induced by ionization electrons drifting between two electrodes. In the case of Atlas, the information comes rather from the _current_ measured by the electrodes, not from the deposited electric charge.

The issue discussed in this note is relevant for the strip compartment of the EM calorimeter, where a point charge (ionization electron) would in principle induce a signal on more than one electrode. This energy sharing becomes more important as the strip pitch decreases with respect to the gap.

The complete electrostatic problem, taking into account the actual accordion geometry, is a very complicated one and will not be addressed here. However, the _total_ induced current (_i.e._ the sum on all the electrodes ) can be expressed by

\[i=e\vec{v}\cdot\frac{\vec{E}}{V} \tag{1}\]

where \(\vec{v}\) is the electron velocity and \(\vec{E}\) is the electric field due to voltage \(V\) being applied between the electrodes. Of course one still has to compute \(\vec{E}(\vec{r})\) for the given geometry. This is not the purpose of this note.

## 2 The electrostatic problem

We calculate the charge and current induced on every strip in the parallel-plate region of the gap, _i.e._ far from the accordion bends. To further simplify the calulation, the following assumptions are made:* strips are infinite in one direction; strip boundaries are straight lines;
* the space between two strips is infinitely narrow;
* infinite current may flow on the electrode surface (perhaps also through front-end circuits, which therefore are assumed to have zero impedance) in order to maintain all the strips at the same potential.

It is therefore sufficient to solve the problem of a point charge placed inside an infinite parallel-plate capacitor, as shown in Fig. 1.

The charge density induced on the lower plate is [1]

\[\sigma(\rho)=-\frac{q}{L^{2}}\sum_{n\geq 1}{(-1)^{n}\sin(\frac{n\pi z}{L})K_{0}( \frac{n\pi\rho}{L})} \tag{2}\]

where \(\rho\) is the distance to the symmetry axis and \(K_{0}(x)\) is the modified Bessel function of the second kind, zeroth order.

Although (2) is a complicated formula, one may (after tedious calculus) derive the following simple expression for the charge induced on a semi-infinite plane, bounded by a straight line at distance \(b\) from the axis:

\[Q=\frac{q}{\pi}\left(\frac{A}{2}-\arctan\left(\tan\frac{A}{2}\tanh\frac{B}{2} \right)\right) \tag{3}\]

where \(A=\pi z/L,B=\pi b/L\). Because the charge \(q\) drifts towards the electrodes, the corresponding induced current is \(J=\dot{Q}=\partial Q/\partial A\)\(\dot{A}\) which again has the following simple expression:

\[J=\frac{q}{2t_{d}}\left(1-\frac{\sinh B}{\cosh B+\cos A}\right). \tag{4}\]

Figure 1:

The total induced charge is \(Q_{tot}=-qz/L\) and the total current \(J_{tot}=-q/t_{d}\). The latter does not depend on \(z\), in agreement with (1) applied to this particular configuration. The influence of the point charge \(q\) decreases as \(\exp(-\pi|b|/L)\) away from the axis, that is, by a factor \(\sim 1/23\) every gap length.

## 3 Practical Examples

### Initial current / Short integration time

When a high-energy muon traverses the liquid-argon gap, ionization electrons are produced, uniformly distributed along the trajectory (hit). The resulting induced current is obtained by integrating (4) along the hit, and depends on the incidence angle of the ionizing particle. Figure 2 shows both the initial current induced on a strip, and the current at \(t=0.2t_{d}\), as functions of the hit distance to the strip border, for hits perpendicular to the gap.

A hit perpendicular to the gap induces all its initial current on one strip only, _i.e._ no sharing is present in this case.

This can be easily understood. At \(t=0\), the hit consists of a linear, uniform charge distribution, perpendicular to the electrodes, extending from one electrode to the opposite one.1 Shortly after, all the charges have drifted by a small distance, so globally the charge distribution remains unchanged, with the exception of a small amount of charge missing at \(d=0\) from one electrode, and a small amount of charge which has reached the opposite electrode.

Footnote 1: Physically, there is also a positive ion column, but on these time scales, the ions remain motionless, hence induce no current.

There is no current sharing because the ends of the charged string (the only ones to contribute) are at \(d=0\) from each electrode. This argument is no longer valid if the charge distribution does not extend throughout the gap length, for instance some time after the drift has started. Neither is it true for hits which are not perpendicular to the gap, in which case the whole electron column moves with respect to its initial position (Figure 3).

### Pulse shapes over total drift time

For hits perpendicular to the gap, we have seen that there is no sharing at \(t=0\), but sharing does develop later on. Hence, the pulses cannot have triangular shapes. Pulse shapes for two adjacent strips are shown in Figure 4 for perpendicular hits, and in Figure 5 for hits with an incidence angle of \(35^{\circ}\). Charges flow from one strip to the other via the amplifiers, which have been assumed ideal (\(Z=0\)).

Consider now the case of the ATLAS EM Calorimeter. The gap is \(2.09\) mm wide; the measured energy is proportional to the current integrated during the first \(\sim 40\) ns, or \(1/10\) of the total drift time. Figure 6 shows the characteristic shape due to the energy sharing, as currently implemented in the ATLAS simulation program. The plot was obtained using 1300 single muon events with no vertex spread. Only the EM Calorimeter was simulated; in addition, multiple scattering, bremsstrahlung and \(\delta\)-ray emission were turned off by GEANT switches.

## 4 Conclusion

The amount of current sharing is present but limited compared to the "single-electrode" arctan-approximation, previously used in DICE. The result presented here has been implemented in DICE as of 96_9 version, thanks to G. Parrour and P. Petroff.

## 5 Appendix

The charge density (2) is integrated on a semi-infinite plane beginning at distance \(b\) from the symmetry axis. Let us denote by \({\cal I}\) the radial integral

\[{\cal I}=\int K_{0}(\frac{n\pi\rho}{L}){\rm d}a\]

which can be written in polar coordinates

\[{\cal I} = 2\int_{0}^{\pi}/2\,{\rm d}\phi\int_{b/\sin\phi}^{\infty}\rho\;{ \rm d}\rho\;K_{0}(\frac{n\pi\rho}{L})\] \[= 2\int_{0}^{\pi}/2\,{\rm d}\phi\;\frac{bL}{n\pi\sin\phi}K_{1}( \frac{n\pi b}{L\sin\phi}).\]

By performing the substitution \(\sin\phi^{2}\equiv 1/t\), the integral can be rewritten in the following form [2]\[{\cal I} = \frac{bL}{n\pi}\int_{1}^{\infty}\frac{{\rm d}t}{\sqrt{t(t-1)}}K_{1} \left(\frac{n\pi b}{L}\sqrt{t}\right)\] \[= \frac{bL}{n\pi}\left[K_{1/2}(\frac{n\pi b}{2L})\right]^{2}\] \[= \frac{L^{2}}{\pi n^{2}}\exp{(-\frac{n\pi b}{L})}.\]

The following series remains to be computed:

\[Q = \frac{q}{\pi}\sum_{n\geq 1}\frac{(-1)^{n}}{n}\sin{(\frac{n\pi z}{L} )}\exp{(-\frac{n\pi b}{L})}\] \[= \frac{q}{\pi}\sum_{n\geq 1}\frac{(-1)^{n}}{n}\sin{(nA)}\exp{(-nB)}\] \[= \frac{q}{\pi}\,\Im\left[\sum_{n\geq 1}\frac{(-1)^{n}}{n}\exp{ \left(n(iA-B)\right)}\right]\] \[= \frac{q}{\pi}\,\Im\left[\sum_{n\geq 1}\frac{(-1)^{n}}{n}\Big{(} \cos{(nZ)}+i\sin{(nZ)}\Big{)}\right]\]

where \(A=\pi z/L\), \(B=\pi b/L\) and \(Z=A+iB\). By using [3] we find

\[Q = \frac{q}{\pi}\,\Im\left[\log{\left(2\cos\,\frac{Z}{2}\right)}+i \frac{Z}{2}\right]\] \[= \frac{q}{\pi}\,\,\left[\frac{A}{2}-\arctan{\left(\tan\,\frac{A}{ 2}\tanh\frac{B}{2}\right)}\right]\]
