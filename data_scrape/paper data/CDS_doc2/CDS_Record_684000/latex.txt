Introduction

The performances of the Calypso MDT prototype BIL chamber [1] have been extensively investigated at the CERN H8 test beam area over the last three years. In this note we will report on the response of the chamber to a high voltage and a threshold scan. The data which we refer to were taken during the spring 1997 and summer 1998 when the Calypso MDT chamber was operated with different gas mixtures and in different conditions. In particular in 1997 the gas under study was the Ar/N\({}_{2}\)/CH\({}_{4}\) (91/4/5) mixture, (also referred as "Datcha" gas ), while in 1998 the chamber was operated with an Ar/CO\({}_{2}\) (93/7) gas mixture.

This note is organised as follows: the experimental setup is presented in the next section together with the Calypso settings of operation for the two different periods of data taking, while general aspects of the analysis, applicable to both gas operating conditions, will be reviewed in sections 3 and 4. In particular, the raw time spectra and the high voltage dependence of the individual tube time offset \(t_{o}\), as well as the maximum drift time are reported in section 3. Section 4 shortly describes two analysis techniques (see also [2] for details) used to extract the r-t relation and the space resolution of the chamber. These two methods will be referred to as a "quick" method (only applicable in particular beam conditions ) and as the "autocalibration" technique, respectively. Finally, the high voltage and threshold scan results are reported in section 5 together with a GARFIELD [3] Monte Carlo simulation.

## 2 Experimental setup

### 1997 data: Calypso operated with the "Datcha" gas

The Calypso chamber has been tested in May 1997 with a 180 GeV/c muon beam. A coincidence between a \(10\times 10\) cm\({}^{2}\) and a \(10\times 15\) cm\({}^{2}\) scintillators, has been used to select a central portion of the chamber: therefore only a few tubes were accessed by the trigger. A scheme of the experimental setup is shown in Fig. 1. The angle of the chamber with respect to the muon beam could be varied, however the data analysed here have been taken with the chamber almost perpendicular to the beam, the angle between the normal to the chamber and the beam direction being as small as 10 mrad. The "mechanics" of the Calypso chamber and the read-out adopted during these tests are described in details in [1, 2].

The chamber was operated in proportional mode with a 3 bar absolute pressure Ar/N\({}_{2}\)/CH\({}_{4}\) (91/4/5) gas mixture, also referred to as "Datcha" gas. The nominal high voltage value was chosen to be HV = 3270 V, corresponding to a gas gain of \(2\times 10^{4}\) and the external discriminator threshold was set at a low voltage (LV) \(V_{0}=1.48\) V, corresponding to a discriminator threshold of 56 \(mV\). The number of primary electron at that threshold was determined to be \(ne_{thres}=28\). The HV (i.e. the gas gain ) was varied while keeping the low voltage reference threshold constant,and then the LV threshold was varied while keeping the reference HV constant.

It is important to notice however that both scans result in a change of the threshold in terms of primary electron number, as can be seen in tables 1 and 2.

During the HV scan data taking the applied low voltage reference threshold was kept constant at \(V_{0}=1.48\) V. In table 1 the values of the applied HV's are reported together with the gain (as extracted from [4]) and the \(ne_{thres}\) hence obtained.

Further threshold scan measurements have been carried out at fixed gain (HV = 3.27 KV, gain = \(2\times 10^{4}\)) by varying the low voltage reference values \(V_{0}\). The measurement settings are reported in table 2.

### 1998 data: Calypso operated with the Ar/CO\({}_{2}\) gas mixture

During July 1998, data have been taken in the same experimental area with the same mechanical setup, front-end electronics and trigger conditions (see [7] for details). The gas mixture used this time was Ar/CO\({}_{2}\) (93/7) at 3 bar absolute pressure. The nominal high voltage, gain and discriminator threshold settings were: HV = 3080 V, Gain = \(2\times 10^{4}\) and equivalent primary electron threshold \(ne_{thres}=25\)

with a low voltage value \(V_{0}=1.40\) V. Also in this case the high voltage value was varied, resulting in an effective primary electron number threshold change, as reported in table 3. At each HV setting the angle of the incoming muon beam with respect to the perpendicular to the chamber was varied between \(0^{\circ}\) and \(11^{\circ}\) allowing convergence of the autocalibration results to the "true" space-time relation (see section 4). Moreover, the momentum of the beam was 180 GeV/c in the case of the nominal operating conditions, while it was 20 GeV/c when running with higher gains.

## 3 Time spectra analysis

The (individual) time offset \(t_{o}\) and the total drift time \(t_{width}\), entering the computation of the space position from the time information (the r-t relation), are directly extracted from the raw time spectra of each tube: they can be deduced by fitting

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{c c c} \hline HV (KV) & Gain & Threshold (\(n\,e_{thres}\pm 1.5\)) \\ \hline

the TDC spectrum of each individual tube with the following analytical function [5]:

\[N(t)=P_{1}+\frac{P_{2}\times\left[1+P_{3}\times\mathit{ex}\mathit{p}(\frac{P_{5} -t}{P_{4}})\right]}{\left[1+\mathit{ex}\mathit{p}(\frac{P_{5}-t}{A})\right] \times\left[1+\mathit{ex}\mathit{p}(\frac{t-P_{5}}{B})\right]} \tag{1}\]

The time spectra of a "Datcha" gas operated tube at 3.6 and 3.2 KV are shown in Fig. 2**a** and **b** respectively. Function (1) is superimposed to the data. Figs. 2**c** and **d** display the leading and trailing edge parts of the two previous spectra: a shift in the position of the two edges at different voltages can be clearly seen.

During our analysis we found that while eq. (1) represents a good parametrization of the data in case of the "Datcha" gas (and more generally when dealing with gases with a linear space-time relation), it has to be slightly modified when dealing with non-linear gases such as Ar/CO\({}_{2}\).

Figure 2: Time spectra of a “Datcha” gas operated tube at 3.6 (a) and 3.2 KV (b). Leading edge (c) and trailing edge (d) parts of the spectra are superimposed and zoomed to show the shift in the position of the two edges at different voltages.

In the above equation, the parameter \(P_{5}\) defines the time offset \(t_{o}\) as the time at half of the maximum of the leading edge (minimum drift time). The maximum time window, \(t_{width}\), can be derived as \(t_{width}=(P_{6}-P_{5})\), where \(P_{6}\) is the time at half the maximum of the trailing edge (maximum drift time) [5]. We should notice that \(t_{o}\) depends on the delay of the TDC with respect to the trigger and contains therefore an irrelevant constant. However the difference between the \(t_{o}\) values in different conditions depends on the gas properties and is therefore relevant. Moreover, in spite of the fact that the \(t_{o}\) calculated so far does not represent the very beginning of the time spectrum, only the relative \(t_{o}\)'s of the involved tubes are important in the determination of the r-t relation, since a small offset common to all the tubes is reabsorbed in the r-t extraction procedure. Details on the fitting function parameters and their error propagation into the r-t relation can be found in [5].

The time spectra of the Ar/CO\({}_{2}\) gas operated tube at 3080 and 3185 V are shown in Fig. 3 with the appropriate fitting function superimposed to the data. From the

Figure 5: Dependence of the parameters t\({}_{0}\) and t\({}_{width}\) on High Voltage for a Ar/CO\({}_{2}\) operated MDT chamber

exploded views of the leading and trailing edges shown in the lowest panels it is clear how the total drift time changes with the high voltage as expected when dealing with non linear gases.

The dependence of the two previously defined parameters \(t_{o}\) and \(t_{width}\) on high voltage are shown in Figs. 4 and 5 for three correlated tubes belonging to the three planes of the first multilayer. In the case of the "Datcha" gas, as the high voltage increases, the \(t_{o}\) values decrease as it is expected by an effective decrease in the number of electron thresholds. However the maximum drift time \(t_{width}\) remains constant: this is expected since the drift velocity is in a saturation regime with respect to the applied electric field.

The experimental behaviour discussed above is reproduced using the Garfield simulation program both for the "Datcha" and the Ar/CO\({}_{2}\) gas mixture. The results for "Datcha" gas in a chamber operated at HV = 3200 Volt and HV = 3600 Volt are presented in Fig. 6 a) where the difference between the time values obtained using these two extreme HV values are plotted as a function of the tube radius. The observed difference shows an almost flat behaviour: this indicates that the two spectra are shifted in time one with respect to the other but the maximum drift time \(t_{width}\) stays constant in agreement with the experimental data. The same plot, presented in Fig. 6 b) in case of the Ar/CO\({}_{2}\) mixture at HV = 3080 Volt and HV = 3185 Volt, shows that the time difference is small in a region near the sense wire and increases up to 35-40 ns at the maximum distance. In this case, as

expected, the maximum drift time \(t_{w\,idh}\) is not constant as a function of the HV value.

## 4 Analysis techniques

A very accurate knowledge of the relation between space and drift+time (r-t relation in the following) is necessary to operate the \(MDT\) chambers in an optimal way. This relation is known to depend critically on the gas composition but also on pressure, temperature and magnetic field. However it is expected to be the same for different \(MDT\) tubes provided they operate in the same conditions.

The present section will briefly describe the procedures followed to obtain the results described in this note (r-t relations and space resolutions).

### A quick method.

A quick and simple method can be used, under appropriate conditions, to measure the drift velocity, the r-t relation and the individual tube space resolution.

A single tube time distribution \(dn/dt\), reported in Fig. 2, can be approximatively related to the drift velocity \(v_{d}(t)\) through the equation [6]:

\[v_{d}(t)=\frac{dr}{dt}=\frac{dr}{dn}\frac{dn}{dt}=\frac{R_{tube}}{N_{tot}} \frac{dn}{dt} \tag{2}\]

In this formula a uniform distribution of tracks having a constant efficiency, with respect to the distance \(r\) from the wire has been assumed, so that \(dn/dr=const=N_{tot}/R_{tube}\). Hence we find that the time spectrum of a tube, when illuminated by a uniform distribution of tracks along its diameter, has the same time dependence of the drift velocity.

The r-t relation can be obtained by integrating the drift velocity :

\[r(t)=\int_{0}^{t}v_{d}(t^{\prime})dt^{\prime}=\frac{R_{tube}}{N_{tot}}\int_{ 0}^{t}\frac{dn}{dt^{\prime}}dt^{\prime} \tag{3}\]

It has to be pointed out that the \(v_{d}(t)\), and consequently the \(r\)-\(t\) relation calculated in this way, are approximate, several effects contributing to spoil this simple relationship. For instance a well known problem is due to tracks passing near the wall of the drift tubes: sometimes they do not produce a number of electrons above the threshold and moreover the behaviour of the drift tubes is not well known in that region. This translates into an uncertainty in the normalization costant \(N_{tot}\). The way these effects can be taken into account can be found in refs. [2, 8].

The drift velocity and the \(r\)-\(t\) relation computed using this method are presented in Fig. 7 when Calypso, filled with the "Datcha" gas, was operated at 3.3 KV. Further studies have shown that the \(r\)-\(t\) relation obtained in this way can provide differences up to few hundreds \(\mu\)m if compared with the one obtained with more accuracy through the autocorrelation procedure.

Figure 7: Times spectrum, drift velocity, and space-time relations as obtained by eqs 2 and 3.

When all the tracks are parallel and almost perpendicular to the chamber a quick evaluation of the space resolution can be obtained correlating the drift times measured in two corresponding tubes: one in the first and the other in the third layer of a multilayer (\(t_{1}\) and \(t_{3}\)). In this case the spread in the distribution of the time difference between \(t_{1}\) and \(t_{3}\) (\(t_{1}-t_{3}\)) is mainly due to the intrinsic tube resolution. The time resolution as a function of the drift time \(\sigma(t)\) can hence be obtained by measuring \(\sigma(t_{1}-t_{3})\) as a function of \(t_{1}\) and dividing it by \(\sqrt{2}\) (see also [2]). Once \(\sigma(t)\) and the local drift velocity are known (e.g. through eq. 2), we can derive the space resolution as a function of the drift space:

\[\sigma(r)=v_{d}(t)\times\sigma(t)\]

In Fig. 8 the results of this method are shown. The obtained space resolution differs only by few percent from the one obtained through the autocalibration technique (see below).

Although the autocalibration technique is a more general and accurate method to obtain space-time relation and space resolution, sometimes it is necessary to switch to the "quick method" to get more reliable results. This is the case when data are taken at a single beam angle. This condition, in fact, makes the convergence of the autocalibration method less reliable and brings uncertainties which are larger then those affecting the "quick method".

### The autocalibration technique.

The autocalibration[2] is an iterative procedure allowing the determination of the space-time relation. At each step of the procedure a starting space-time relation is used to convert time measurements into drift radii for use in a track fit. If the space-time relation were known the average residual difference \(R_{raw}-R_{extr}\), where \(R_{raw}\) is the radius obtained using the r-t relation and \(R_{extr}\) is the distance of the tube center from the fitted track, would be zero at all radii. Deviations from zero indicate distortions in the space-time relation and the average deviation itself, at a given radius, can be directly used to correct the space-time relation being used. Few iterations are needed to obtain an r-t relation which coincides within errors with the input one.

#### 4.2.1 Pattern recognition and track selection

The first pass of the track reconstruction consists in the identification of tubes hit by a charged track (pattern recognition) and does not make use of the time information of each individual tube. The pattern recognition used in the present analysis is based on the use of a table of reference patterns. All possible tubes topologies, induced by a straight track \(y=a_{0}x+b_{0}\), were computed by tracing a line at different angles and different intercepts, in accordance with the beam emittance as defined by the trigger. The intercept of the track (\(b_{0}\)) was asked to span over several radii of one tube put in the first layer and then several slopes (\(a_{0}\)) were used for each used radius. The pattern of tubes hit for each pair of \(a_{0}\), \(b_{0}\) was recorded. The grid in the starting parameters was chosen such as not to miss any possible topology. Repeated configurations were rejected.

All physical hits of one event were compared with the reference patterns and required to exactly match one, at least partly. Only the matching hits were used in the track reconstruction.

#### 4.2.2 Track reconstruction and the r-t relation.

The time information of each associated tube was then used to reconstruct the track direction, i.e. the straight line of equation \(y=a_{0}x+b_{0}\).

Charged tracks were reconstructed by searching the best tangent to all drift circles of radius \(R_{raw}=r(TDC-t_{0})\), where \(r(TDC-t_{0})\) is the r-t relation and \(t_{0}\) indicates the minimum drift time introduced earlier. The minimization package Minuit was used to find the pair of parameters \(a_{0}\), \(b_{0}\) (and their errors \(\Delta a_{0}\), \(\Delta b_{0}\)) which minimize the quantity

Figure 9: Iterations in the autocalibration technique to determine the space-time relation in Datcha gas.

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:14]

from the linear relation used as input at iteration \(0-th\). The additional corrections computed at next passes are less and less important. At the 4th pass all residuals are contained within \(\pm 10\mu m\) and the "optimal" r-t relation is found. In the case of the Ar/CO\({}_{2}\) gas mixture the r-t relation obtained from the "quick" method was used as input at iteration 0-th (see Fig. 10).

Fig. 11 gives an example of track reconstruction when the final r-t relation is used.

#### 4.2.3 Tube resolution.

Once the r-t relation has been established, the individual tube resolution can be measured. The minimization of eq.(4) is now carried out summing over all layers but one and the residuals of the missing layer are plotted as a function of the radius as can be seen in Fig. 12(a)

The distribution of the residuals in each radius slice (Fig. 12(b)) is now affected not only by the tube drift resolution but also by the extrapolation error \(\Delta R_{extr}\), depending on \(\Delta a_{0}\), \(\Delta b_{0}\), which can be either computed through a Monte Carlo simulation or on an event by event basis from the data, provided they are collected

Figure 11: Four events overlayed in one event display.

at the same incident beam angle (fig. 12(c)). At the end of the processing the resolution was computed to be

\[\sigma(R_{raw})=\sqrt{\Delta R_{raw}^{2}-\Delta R_{extr}^{2}}\]

where \(\Delta R_{raw}\) is the measured spread in slice \(R_{raw}\) as determined by a gaussian fit to the data (fig. 12(d) show such fit) and \(\Delta R_{extr}\) is the value the extrapolation error assumes at a distance \(R_{raw}\) (fig. 12(c)).

The dependence of the resolution on the radius was studied, and the new derived functional dependence was then used in the following iteration. The procedure stops when input and output functional dependencies agree within errors, typically after four iterations. In practice either a polynomial expression or a decreasing exponential added to a constant value were used.

Results

### Noise and tube efficiency

A study of the noise level induced by changing the low voltage of the discriminator threshold was performed only using the "Datcha" gas. Different sources of background contribute to this level, and some of them are related to specific working conditions such as hits produced by beam-induced knock-on delta rays. For this reason, rather than giving the noise absolute value, all results are quoted with respect to a low voltage working point taken as a default.

The noise contribution was computed for each tube extrapolating inside the real events time window the random hits found outside. The results at different thresholds were normalized to those obtained at the reference value of 1.48 Volt (corresponding to 28 electrons) and the distribution of this ratio was taken to be representative of the mean variation of the response for all the tubes of the Calypso chamber. The dependence of this ratio as a function of the threshold value is presented in Fig. 13.

As expected a flattening of the distribution is observed as the threshold increases.

The efficiency as a function of the tube radius was also studied both for "Datcha" and Ar/CO\({}_{2}\) gas mixtures when varying the HV values as shown in Fig. 14.

For every event each of the six layers was neglected in turn and a straight line

Figure 13: Calypso operated with the “Datcha” gas mixture: relative noise ratio as a function of the discriminator LV threshold values. Values are normalized to LV = 1.48 Volt (28 primary electrons).

passing for the other five layers was fitted. The efficiency was then defined to be the fraction of times one hit was found in the tube not included in the fit at a distance of less than three sigmas from the extrapolated track. As seen in the figure, the efficiency is gently decreasing from 99% to 96% when going from 0.5 mm to 1.35 cm and has a value of the order of 97% at a radius of 0.5 cm, independently of the HV and of the gas mixture. After 1.35 cm the efficiency decreases as already seen in [5].

### Resolution

Results of the HV scan analysis of "Datcha" gas data are given in fig. 15 for the three layers of the first multilayer. The variation as a function of the radius of the fitted value of space resolution is shown for \(HV=3.2\), 3.3, 3.4, 3.6 KV respectively. The same data are also displayed in Fig. 16 where the three layers are averaged and compared with the GARFIELD predicted behaviour at the corresponding working conditions.

From the data reported in Fig. 16 and averaging in the region between 5 to 10 mm from the wire, where the space resolution tends to be flat, a "central" resolution \(\sigma_{cent}\) can be defined at a given high voltage setting. The result is shown in Fig. 17.

Figure 14: Tube efficiency as a function of radius for different HV working conditions both for “Datcha” and Ar/CO\({}_{2}\) gas mixtures.

The threshold scan data (see tab. 2) have been collected with only one operational multi-layer, at a fixed angle, with the chamber almost perpendicular to the beam and only using the "Datcha" gas. In these conditions the "quick" method has been used to investigate the response of the chamber (see Section 4.1). A comparison of the measured resolutions as obtained at the highest and at the lowest threshold settings is reported in Fig. 18. As already done in the case of the "HV scan" we have evaluated the resolution in the central region.

On the basis of tables 1 and 2 when Calypso operated with the "Datcha" mixture, these results can be combined and studied as a function of \(ne_{thres}\) only. In Fig. 19 the central resolutions resulting from the HV scan analysis and from the threshold scan analysis, are reported.

Finally, in Fig 20 the resolutions obtained for the three layers of the first multi-layer of Calypso operated with Ar/CO\({}_{2}\) are shown. Individually, each plot shows a rather good agreement between the data and the GARFIELD simulation. More in detail, it can be noted that, both GARFIELD and the data do not display a strong dependence on the high voltage in the explored range, indicating that the resolution

as a very small sensitivity to variations in gains between \(2\times 10^{4}\) and \(4\times 10^{4}\) when Calypso is operated with the Ar/CO\({}_{2}\) (93/7) gas mixture. A feature should anyhow be discussed: the experimental resolution at large distances from the sense wire is different for layer n. 2 with respect to the other layers. This behaviour is common to all the HV values considered. The explanation comes from the analysis procedure used to compute the resolution. In fact, taking into account that the tracks are almost perpendicular to the chamber, the algorithm to compute the resolution on each of the two "central" layers performs a track fitting using four out of five tubes at small radius, in a region where the resolution is rather poor and steep (see figure). This means that even a small uncertainty in the time measurement (of the order of 1 ns) or in the time dependence of the resolution can introduce large systematic effects. A check of this explanation was performed varying both the \(t_{0}\) values and the resolution function and observing the corresponding variation in the resolution values. Systematics in the second layer were reduced but not completely eliminated, while the obtained resolution in the first and third layers were rather stable.

Figure 16: Data are the same as previous figure averaging over the three layers contributions. The calculations by GARFIELD are also reported for comparision.

Conclusions

The characteristics of the MDT Calypso chamber filled with two different gas mixtures have been investigated in response to high voltage and discriminator threshold scans. The results show that, as expected, the resolution improves when lowering the threshold in the number of primary electrons necessary to define a real event independently on which method is chosen. While an increase of the high voltage at a gain exceeding \(2\times 10^{4}\) is not recommended (especially for chamber aging problems), the lowering of the discriminator threshold can be further investigated.

The best compromise between a good resolution and a low noise level (the latter increasing at low thresholds) is planned to be studied in more details during test beam measurements and/or during the QA/QC tests which will be performed in the next future at the test site of Roma Tre.
