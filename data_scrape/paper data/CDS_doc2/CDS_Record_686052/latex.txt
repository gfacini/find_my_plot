###### Abstract

ATLAS prototype n-in-n and p-in-n detectors from a number of manufacturers were irradiated with 24GeV/c protons to \(3\times 10^{14}pcm^{-2}\) at the CERN PS. To study the long term effects of radiation damage the detectors underwent controlled thermal annealing over a period equivalent to 21 days at 25\({}^{\circ}\)C to simulate 10 years of LHC operation. Current-voltage and capacitance-voltage measurements at various frequencies were used to monitor the warm-up. In this paper we observe the changes of depletion voltage and detector current as a function of time.

## Introduction

The ATLAS detector at the LHC will include a 63\(m^{2}\) silicon tracker, consisting of silicon microstrip and pixel detectors [1]. These detectors will be exposed to very large fluences of charged and uncharged hadrons and gammas during the proposed 10 year operation. Damage of the detectors due to the harsh radiation environment will be principally due to charged hadrons. The maximum fluence expected in the ATLAS semiconductor tracker is \(1.4\times 10^{14}\) 1MeV equivalent \(ncm^{-2}\) over ten years. The uncertainties in the fluence calculation lead to a contingency factor of 1.5. As the damage factor for 24GeV protons is now believed to be lower than that for 1MeV neutrons [2], this requires that detectors be irradiated to \(3\times 10^{14}pcm^{-2}\) to simulate 10 years of LHC operation.

Detectors were irradiated to this level with 24 GeV/c protons at the PS at CERN. During the irradiation detectors were kept in a sealed box, where the temperature remained at -8\({}^{\circ}\)C \(\pm\) 1\({}^{\circ}\)C. Detectors were irradiated for a total of 300 hours, and during this time had a 150V bias applied.

## Motivation

Highly energetic hadrons cause bulk damage in silicon by displacing atoms from the lattice. One effect of this is a change in the dopant concentration of the silicon material. It is thought that additional acceptor levels are introduced close to the mid-bandgap, which lead to compensation of donors. Type inversion is observed at hadron fluences of 3-5 x \(10^{13}pcm^{-2}\)[2].

Macroscopically a change of the full depletion voltage and the leakage current is observed. The leakage current increases with the received fluence and, since leakage current is temperature dependent, cooling the detector reduces these effects.

Both the leakage current and full depletion voltage show an annealing behaviour after irradiation. The temperature and time dependence of these parameters have been described in several publications. Descriptions and models of the annealing behaviour of the leakage current and the depletion voltage have been given by [2, 3, 4].

A final model describing the effects of radiation in silicon has not yet been established. There are still disagreements as to whether donors are in fact removed and the exact nature of the mid gap levels introduced. For the results discussed here the Ziock parameterisation [3] has been used. Before the annealing programme began the detectors were stored in a freezer at -10\({}^{\circ}\)C for around two weeks.

### Full Depletion Voltage

The dependence of the full depletion voltage \(V_{de\,p}\) on the effective doping concentration \(N_{eff}\) is given by:

\[N_{eff}=\frac{(V_{dep}+V_{bi})\cdot 2\epsilon\epsilon_{0}}{ed_{0}^{2}} \tag{1}\]

where \(V_{bi}\) is the built in voltage of the material, \(\epsilon\) and \(\epsilon_{0}\) are the permittivities, \(d\) is the thickness and \(e\) the electron charge.

The damage due to high radiation can be explained by donor removal and acceptor creation and is expressed as [3]:

\[N_{eff}=N_{0}\exp{(-c\phi)}+\beta\phi \tag{2}\]

where \(N_{0}\) represents the initial number of donors, \(\phi\) is the fluence and \(c\) and \(\beta\) are constants.

The annealing of the full depletion voltage can be separated into short and long term effects, with time constants of \(\tau_{S}\) and \(\tau_{L}\) respectively. These are strongly temperature dependent and decrease with falling temperature. The short term annealing can be seen as a beneficial annealing where the active acceptor sites decay exponentially back to the neutral inactive sites. Thus the depletion voltage decreases exponentially. For longer time scales the reverse annealing dominates and leads to increasing full depletion voltage.

The time evolution of the full depletion voltage can be expressed as:

\[V_{de\,p}(t)=V_{Z}+V_{S}\exp(-t/\tau_{S})+V_{A}(1-\exp(-t/\tau_{L})). \tag{3}\]

\(V_{Z}\) represents the fraction of the stable radiation-induced acceptor concentration. This neglects annealing effects during irradiation [3].

The short term annealing part of the depletion voltage in equation 3 is described by the term:

\[V_{S}\exp{(-t/\tau_{S})}. \tag{4}\]

\(V_{S}\) is related to the metastable acceptor concentration produced during irradiation.

The long term annealing contribution in equation 3 is described by the term:

\[V_{A}[1-\exp(-t/\tau_{L})]. \tag{5}\]

\(V_{A}\) represents the concentration of damage sites that can become activated acceptor sites.

The short and the long term time constants are temperature dependent and have been expressed as [3]:

\[\tau_{L}=9140\exp{(-0.152T)} \tag{6}\]

\[\tau_{S}=70\exp{(-0.175T)} \tag{7}\][3]

where T is the temperature in \({}^{\circ}\)C.

The values of \(\tau_{L}\) and \(\tau_{S}\) for temperatures in the annealing study can be seen in Table 1.

\(V_{Z}\), \(V_{A}\) and \(V_{S}\) are directly proportional to the fluence and can be written as [3]\(\nu_{Z}\), \(\nu_{A}\) and \(\nu_{S}\), respectively, where the following applies for 300\(\mu\)m thick detectors [3]:

\[V_{Z}=\phi\nu_{Z} \tag{8}\]

\[V_{A}=\phi\nu_{A} \tag{9}\]

\[V_{S}=\phi\nu_{S} \tag{10}\]

\[V_{U}=\phi\nu_{U} \tag{11}\]

The constants \(\nu_{Z}\), \(\nu_{A}\), \(\nu_{S}\) and \(\nu_{U}\) have been determined by [3] with measurements carried out on silicon PIN diodes irradiated to different fluences. For 300\(\mu\)m thick detectors, and irradiation with protons, these give:

\[\nu_{Z}=1.06\times 10^{-12}Vcm^{2} \tag{12}\]

\[\nu_{A}=3.8\times 10^{-12}Vcm^{2} \tag{13}\]

\[\nu_{S}=1.34\times 10^{-12}Vcm^{2} \tag{14}\]

\[\nu_{U}=4.78\times 10^{-12}Vcm^{2} \tag{15}\]

During the 10 year operation of LHC the ATLAS detector will be operated at a temperature of around \(-7^{\circ}C\)[5]. The zieck parameterisation [3] for warm-up during detector maintenance assumes 2 days at \(20^{\circ}C\) and 2 weeks at \(17^{\circ}C\) per annum [6]. To complete the study within a short timescale, warm-up temperatures at which the detectors will reach the same reverse annealing as during ten years of LHC have been calculated as shown in Table 2[6].

Using equation 3, figure 1 shows the change in apparent full depletion voltage as a function of time at \(25^{\circ}\)C. Note that the parameterisation was based on C-V measurements taken at a frequency of 10kHz. The short and the long term contributions are indicated by broken lines.

### Leakage Current Annealing

During irradiation the detector current increases significantly and is proportional to the received fluence. The dependency of the volume leakage current on the fluence can be described as follows:

\[\Delta I_{V}=\alpha\phi \tag{16}\]

The damage constant \(\alpha\) has a value of \(5-10\times 10^{-17}Acm^{-1}\) immediately after irradiation, and anneals exponentially with a series

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|} \hline Temperature (\({}^{\circ}C\)) & \(\tau_{L}(days)\) & \(\tau_{S}(days)\) \\ \hline \hline -1 5 & 89 358.9 & 96 6.3 \\ \hline -10 & 41 790 & 40 2.8 \\ \hline -8 & 3083 5 & 28 3.9 \\ \hline + 22 & 322.6 & 1.49 \\ \hline + 23 & 277 & 1.25 \\ \hline + 25 & 204.4 & 0.88 \\ \hline \end{tabular}

## Experimental Procedure

A total of nine microstrip detectors, as detailed in Table 3, were chosen to take part in the warm-up study. These consisted of a selection of p-in-n and n-in-n detectors produced by various manufacturers.

All detectors were approximately 64mm \(\times\) 63.6mm with 768+2 readout strips. All detectors were mounted on ceramics or pcb's for the irradiation and except for the Sintef detectors all were glued at their corners. Sintef detectors were mechanically mounted in order that they could be reused after the irradiation. With the exception of the Hamamatsu Specials, pitch-adapters were used to bond the strips to ground during irradiation. Details of detector thickness, passivation, biasing and p-stops are given in the appendix, Table 4.

During the irradiation the detectors were kept at -8 \({}^{\circ}C\), and after irradiation with 24 GeV protons to a fluence of \(3\times 10^{14}pcm^{-2}\) the detectors were stored together in a freezer at -10\({}^{\circ}C\). In order to decrease moisture on the detectors bags of silica gel were placed directly next to each detector. These were then sealed in bags and nitrogen blown through. Initial measurements of leakage current and capacitance were taken at this point, at -8\({}^{\circ}\)C. Then the subset of detectors for the testbeam underwent annealing with careful temperature monitoring.

### Experimental Setup

A Keithley source/measurement unit and electrometer, and an HP LCRmeter were used for the measurements. All devices had previously been tested and used. Labview programs were developed to carry out the measurements. Figure 2 shows a schematic sketch of the setup.

### Annealing Programme

A climate cabinet was used to store the detectors at 25\({}^{\circ}\)C and incorporated a humidity controller set to 16 % relative humidity. All measurements were performed within the cabinet, which was then cooled to -10\({}^{\circ}\)C to measure the leakage current and the detector capacitance. Additional measurements were taken at lower

and higher temperatures to investigate the stability of the detector temperatures.

The detectors were warmed for a total equivalent to 21 days at 25\({}^{\circ}\)C. During the warm-up cycle, leakage current and capacitance measurements were taken intermittently at -10\({}^{\circ}\)C or -8\({}^{\circ}\)C for comparison with the results from other annealing studies [2, 3, 4]. However, during this period the detectors were also being prepared for beam test measurements, and hence part of their warm-up took place at laboratory temperatures of 22 \({}^{\circ}\)C or 23 \({}^{\circ}\)C. An exact temperature history of each detector was recorded in order to normalise to equivalent warm-up time.

### Normalisation

From equation 6 the conversion factors of annealing times for different temperatures can be easily derived: A

\[\frac{1}{\tau_{L}(T_{1}\,)}=\frac{x(day\,s)}{\tau_{L}(T_{2}\,)} \tag{17}\]

All warm-up times were therefore normalised to days at 25\({}^{\circ}\)C.

## Results

### Before Warm-up Cycle

Immediately after irradiation the detectors were stored at -10\({}^{\circ}\)C. Leakage current measurements were taken on all detectors as shown in figure 3. Initially detectors were received in a variety of boxes, plastic and aluminium. Thus sufficient heat dissipation was not guaranteed for all detectors and some showed much higher leakage currents, characteristic of their higher temperatures.

The detectors initially stored in aluminium frames showed a lower and more stable leakage current at high bias voltage than the detectors stored in plastic boxes. Figure 4 clearly shows that for a detector stored in a plastic box the I-V measurement taken after the irradiation shows higher leakage current than that taken whilst the detector was in the irradiation area T7.

Similarly, figure 5 is a comparison of I-V measurements for a detector stored in an aluminium frame. The frame acted as a heat sink for the detectors and allowed heat produced at high bias to be dissipated effectively. Both I-V measurements show similar leakage currents.

Figure 3: Leakage currents before warm-up cycle.

Figure 2: Measurement setup for leakage current and capacitance measurements

Therefore, from this point in time detectors were all placed in aluminium frames to avoid self-heating. Note that the applied bias was limited by the biasbox and the current compliance set for the measurement.

The generation leakage current, \(I_{g}\), depends directly on the temperature of the detector as can be seen from the following equation:

\[I_{g}\,\propto T^{3/2}\exp(-E_{g}/2\,kT) \tag{18}\]

where \(E_{g}\) is the silicon bandgap and k is the Boltzmann constant [8].

A series of I-V measurements were taken on the Hamamatsu wedge detector at temperatures ranging from -8.7\({}^{\circ}\)C to -23.4\({}^{\circ}\)C, as shown in figure 6.

During all measurements a Pt100 temperature sensor was placed close to the detector in order to monitor the temperature. The reliability of the temperature monitoring could then be investigated using equation 18, where the log of the leakage current versus 1/T is an approximately linear relation, as shown in figure 7.

Self heating would be indicated if the data deviated from the Arrhenius plot, particularly at higher temperatures. The data show no evidence for self-heating effects. The current shown is the total leakage current of the detector.

A fit to the data points results in a bandgap energy of 1.15eV.

### During Warm-up Cycle

During the warm-up cycle the leakage current and the full depletion voltage for each detector

were monitored at regular intervals.

The full depletion voltage was estimated from C-V measurements, by plotting \(1/C^{2}\) versus the bias voltage. The full depletion voltage was then taken as the intersection of a line of constant capacitance with the increasing slope at lower bias voltage. Errors due to uncertainties in the fit are estimated to be \(\pm\) 10V. It was found that C-V measurements of irradiated detectors were strongly dependent on the frequency used, as was observed in [9]. Measurements were carried out at 100Hz, 120Hz, 1kHz, 10kHz, 10kHz. As may be seen from figure 8, measurements taken at high frequencies, i.e 100kHz, do not give a good indication of the depletion voltage. Using 100Hz or 120Hz as a measurement frequency allowed a better determination of the full depletion voltage. It was also observed that the full depletion voltage determined at different frequencies did not coincide, and differences of tens of volts were observed between 100Hz and 10kHz measurements. Due to the limited range of frequencies available (five) it was not possible to investigate the frequency dependency of the depletion voltage any further. Hence, measurements of depletion voltage were taken using the lowest available frequency of 100Hz.

In order to investigate the annealing of the leakage current, measurements were taken over the entire warm-up period. The current values at 400V were then plotted as a function of warm-up time at 25\({}^{\circ}\)C. The values at 400V were chosen to ensure that the detectors were fully depleted. One can clearly observe the annealing of the different detectors during the entire warm-up, as shown in figure 9.

Similarly the estimated depletion voltage as a function of warm-up time is shown in figure 10. Since some detector thicknesses differed, all data have been normalised to 300\(\mu\)m thickness.

## Discussion

As can be seen in figure 9 all detectors showed a similar current behaviour. No systematic difference was observed in the leakage current behaviour of p-in-n and n-in-n detectors. During the warm-up cycle current annealing could be observed for all detectors. Over the 21 day period the leakage current decreased by a factor of around 1.5 to 2. This behaviour could not

be observed for the MPI 7 detector. Unfortunately it was only possible to measure the leakage current of this detector three times over the period of the warm-up. This was due to the detectors being subsequently bonded to readout electronics where further measurements were no longer possible. The spread of the measurement points can be partially accounted for by constraints in the time in which measurements were taken; measurements with longer settling time where detectors were kept cold and at a certain bias showed a much more linear behaviour over the annealing time. The data will be analysed in more detail at a future date, where they can be compared to the annealing parameterisation as done in [7].

Although the full depletion voltage determined by C-V measurements cannot be considered to be a true value, due to the frequency dependence, all measurements were taken at the same frequency and conditions. The full depletion voltage measured for each detector can thus be compared.

In figure 10 the depletion voltage has been plotted over the warm-up period. Note that missing data points are due to the detectors being bonded up to readout electronics, which prevented further C-V measurements from being carried out. However, the general trend of the depletion voltage over the warm-up period does show an indication of anti-annealing after around ten days. Initially there is a drop in depletion voltage expected within the first three to four days, reaching a shallow minimum before anti-annealing dominates [3]. From the results of this study a decrease is indicated in all detectors, reaching a minimum at around day eight to ten. This is particularly pronounced for those detectors which were annealed to 21 days (Hamamatsu Wedge 12-1 and Hamamatsu Special 10). After this point a shallow increase can be observed. For the detectors measured over 21 days, the depletion voltage at the end of the annealing was a factor of around 1.2 higher than the value measured at the minimum. The general trend of all detectors that could be measured is in agreement with results from Ziock et al [3]. A detailed analysis of the behaviour of each detector has still to be done, and accurate comparisons with previous results to be carried out. However, the trend of full depletion voltage is similar to earlier observations.
