###### Abstract

With the aim of establishing of an electromagnetic energy scale of the ATLAS Tile calorimeter and understanding of performance of the calorimeter to electrons 12 % of modules have been exposed in electron beams with various energies by three possible ways: cell-scan at \(\theta=20^{o}\) at the centers of the front face cells, \(\eta\)-scan and tilerow scan at \(\theta=90^{o}\) for the module side cells.

We have extracted the electron calibration constants and electron energy resolutions some of these barrel and extended barrel modules at energies E = 10, 20, 50, 100 and 180 GeV for the cell-scan at \(\theta=20^{o}\), the \(\eta\) scan and the tile scan at \(90^{o}\). The average values of these constants are equal to \(\langle R_{e}\rangle=1.157\pm 0.002\) pC/GeV for the cell-scan at \(\theta=20^{o}\), \(\langle R_{e}\rangle=1.143\pm 0.005\) pC/GeV for the \(\eta\)-scan and \(\langle R_{e}\rangle=1.196\pm 0.005\) pC/GeV for the tile-scan at \(\theta=90^{o}\). The RMS values are the following: for the cell-scan is \(RMS=2.6\pm 0.1\) %, for the \(\eta\)-scan is \(RMS=4.2\pm 0.3\) % and for the tile-scan is \(RMS=5.7\pm 0.3\) %. The energy linearities of modules are within RMS = 1 % at \(\theta=20^{o}\) and 2.5 % at \(\theta=90^{o}\). Uniformities for the electron response are in the range of 1 - 2 % for cells and about 4 % for tilerows.

The calibration constants for the tile-scan at \(\theta=90^{o}\) are of 4 % larger the ones for the cell-scan at \(\theta=20^{o}\). This is the manifestation of the transition effect. This difference in the calibration constants should be taken into account at creating of the transfer function from the Cs calibration data at \(90^{o}\) to the cell-scan at \(20^{o}\) electron calibration constants for modules unexposed in test beam runs.

We have studied the electromagnetic energy resolution. We have determined the statistical and constant terms for the electron energy resolution by fitting of the expressions \(\sigma/E=a/\sqrt{E}\oplus b\) and \(\sigma/E=a/\sqrt{E}+b\) to the obtained data. The parameters for the quadratic fit are equal to \(a=29\pm 1.6\) % \(GeV^{1/2}\), \(b=3\pm 0.4\) at \(\theta=20^{o}\) and \(a=22\pm 1\) % \(GeV^{1/2}\), \(b=2.3\pm 0.3\) at \(\theta=90^{o}\). We have compared our results on energy resolution with the Monte Carlo based parametrization. Good agreement is observed for the linear fit.

Non-compensation of the Tile calorimeter has been studied. We have determined the \(e/h\) ratios of the TILECAL for five values of pseudorapidity \(\eta\) in the range of \(-0.55\leq\eta\leq-0.15\) for the beam energy range from 10 GeV to 300 GeV. The obtained \(e/h\) ratios are compared with the experimental data of TILECAL 1 mprototype modules and agree with them. The mean value is \(e/h=1.36\pm 0.01\), which agrees with the Monte Carlo calculations, \(e/h_{MC}=1.40\pm 0.013\), within the errors.

The method of the pion calibration of a single module, which uses the electron calibration constants and the known \(e/h\) ratio, has been suggested and applied. The mean pion energy, deposited in a single module, amounts to 0.89\(\pm\)0.01 % for \(\eta\) scan. The lateral energy leakage for one module amounts to about 10 %. The good (\(\pm\)1 %) energy uniformity is observed.

The pion energy resolution for one module has been studied. The mean one is equal to \((6.0\pm 0.3)\) % \(GeV^{1/2}\) for 180 GeV and comparable with the value (4.8 % \(GeV^{1/2}\)) expected from the required overall physics performance \(\sigma/E=50\)\(\%GeV^{1/2}/\sqrt{E}\oplus 3\) %.

The fit filter method of the PMT signal reconstruction demonstrates 30 % improvement of energy resolution for electron events than the flat filter method and no improvement for pion events. We have compared the pion reconstruction at 180 GeV for \(\theta=90^{o}\) at different tilteows for the flat filter and fit filter methods. The values of the reconstructed energies obtained for these two methods coincide within the errors. So, for the pion reconstruction the fit filter method does not have appreciable advantages.

Introduction

The constructed ATLAS detector at the LHC will have the great physics discovery potential, in particular in the detection of a heavy Higgs boson [1, 2]. Calorimeters will play a crucial role in it.

The key question of calorimetry is the absolute energy calibration. The physics goals have led to the following requirement for the knowledge of the absolute scale of energy: in the case of hadronic jets, the scale should be known to an accuracy of 1 % [3].

The other important issue is the energy linearity. The most stringent linearity requirements for the hadronic calorimeter come from the study of quark compositeness where the jet energy scale has to be linear within 2 % up to the transverse energy of 4 TeV [4].

There are different ways of calibrating of a hadronic calorimeter by muons, electrons, hadrons and hadronic jets [5]. Among ones the important place have the electron calibration as a general energy basis for all detectors of the ATLAS setup.

For the ATLAS hadronic TILECAL calorimeter it is necessary to calibrate 5120 cells which read-out by 10240 PMT's for energies up to 1.5 TeV [6]. For each cell the calibration constants, which define the relationship between the calorimeter signals, expressed in picoCoulombs, and the energy of the absorbed particles, which produced the signals, must be determined.

With the aim of establishing of an electromagnetic energy scale of the ATLAS Tile Calorimeter the collaboration has decided to perform the calibration of 12 % of all produced modules in electron beams with various energies at SPS CERN. This calibration has been performed by three possible ways: cell-scan at \(\theta=20^{o}\) at the centers of front face cells, \(\eta\)-scan (where \(\eta=-\ln\tan\theta/2\) is one the axis of the ATLAS coordinate system), and tile-scan at \(\theta=90^{o}\) for module side cells. In all cases we should calibrate high and low gains of each ADC channel.

The intercalibration (the minimization of the channel-to-channel variation of calibration constants) and monitoring strategy for the Tile Calorimeter is based on several tools [6]:

* The Cesium Monitoring System [7] in which a capsule containing \(Cs^{137}\)\(\gamma\)-source [8] are carried along by a liquid flow inside calibration tubes penetrating through all 440,000 scintillating tiles of the calorimeter.
* The laser system which produces on each PMT a light pulse which closely mimics calorimeter pulses.

* During data-taking at the LHC, continuous monitoring of the signal produced in the calorimeter by minimum bias interactions.

For the relative calibration of electronics channels there is the charge injection system which injects a calibrated charge into each channel.

The talks presented on the Tilecal analysis meetings and Atlas notes devoted to the analysis of the electron testbeam data of 1999 - 2003 years are listed in chapter 13, Appendix.

## 2 The test beam setups

The setup for electron performance study and calibration of production Tile calorimeter modules [6] are the following (Fig. 1).

The setup for electron performance study is shown in Fig. 1 (left). This is the Module-0 surrounded by five 1 m prototype modules which are placed on a scanning table on top and at the bottom of the Module-0 with a 10 cm gap between them. For the measurements of the hadronic shower longitudinal and lateral leakages back (\(80\times 80\)\(cm^{2}\)) and side (\(40\times 115\)\(cm^{2}\)) "muon walls" were placed behind and on the side of the calorimeter.

The setup for electron calibration study is shown in Fig. 1 (right). The Barrel Module 0 is the bottom module mounted on the table. The middle layer is the production barrel module BM. The top layer is the two extended barrel modules: EBM\(+\) for \(\eta>0\) (beam left) and EBM\(-\) for \(\eta<0\) (beam right).

The layout of the readout cell geometry for modules is shown in Fig. 2.

Each cell is a set of scintillating tiles connected by fibers to 2 PMTs. Each module is read out in three longitudinal layers. The first layer consists of A-cells, the second one -- of B- and C-cells, and the third one -- of D-cells. In \(\eta\), the readout cells, built by grouping fibres into PMTs, are "pseudo-projective" towards the interaction region. There are 11 transverse rows of tiles (tilerows)

in a module. For a barrel module A-cells have tilerows 1 - 3, B- and C-cells -- 4 - 7, D-cells -- 8 - 11. For a extended barrel module A-cells have tilerows 1 - 3, B- and C-cells -- 4 - 6, D-cells -- 7 - 11.

## 3 Events Selection

The electron beams at the SPS CERN are the mixture of electrons, muons and hadrons. For our studies is important to have the pure electrons beam. We have estimated that in order to have the systematic error in the electron calibration constant due to the pion contamination smaller than 0.3 % this contamination must be smaller than 1.5 % in the energy range of 10 - 300 GeV. Therefore, the identification of these (\(e\), \(\mu\), \(\pi\)) particles on the basis of the calorimetric information is necessary.

For the muon rejection we have used the cut in the total deposited energy: \(E_{tot}>E_{min}\) with \(E_{min}=5\) GeV. This cut effectively selects muons as muons loose a small fraction of their energy in the calorimeter [9].

Figure 2: The layout of the cell geometry.

### Electron selection using the longitudinal shower profiles

For the electron and pion selection we have used the \(C_{i}\), \(E_{cut}\) and \(\rm\check{C}_{1}\) distributions [10].

The \(C_{i}\) distribution

\[C_{i}=\sum_{selected\ i}\ \sum_{k=1}^{2}\sum_{l=1}^{2}E_{ikl}/E_{beam}, \tag{1}\]

is the relative shower energy deposition in the first two calorimeter depths, where \(E_{ikl}\) is the energy deposition in \(ikl\) cell, \(i\) is the raw number, \(k\) is the depth number, \(l=1,\ 2\) is the PMT number.

The basis for this electron-hadron separation is the different longitudinal energy depositions for electrons and hadrons showers. For example, if a 100 GeV particle crosses 45 cm of the Tile calorimeter from the front face it corresponds to 18 radiation lengths or 2.2 nuclear interaction lengths. The amount of the deposited energy is equal to 95 % for the electromagnetic shower and 50 % for the hadronic shower [11].

Fig. 3 shows some typical \(C_{i}\) (left) distributions. The left peak corresponds to the pion events, the right peak -- the electron events.

Figure 3: The \(C_{i}\) and \(E_{cut}\) distributions for E = 180 GeV [12].

### Electron selection using the lateral shower profiles

The \(E_{cut}\) distribution

\[E_{cut}=\frac{\sqrt{(\sum_{c}(E_{c}^{\alpha}-\sum_{c}E_{c}^{\alpha}/N_{cell})^{2} )/N_{cell}}}{\sum_{c}E_{c}^{\alpha}}\, \tag{2}\]

is related with the lateral shower spread, where \(1\leq c\leq N_{cell}\), \(N_{cell}\) is the used cells number. This spread is connected with the containment radius of shower which considerably differs for the electromagnetic and hadronic showers. For example, for the 100 GeV hadronic shower the 99 % containment radius is equal to 430 mm, but for the electromagnetic shower the one is equal to 70 mm [11]. The power parameter \(\alpha=0.6\) has been tuned to achieve maximum separation efficiency.

Fig. 3 shows some typical \(E_{cut}\) (right) distributions. The left peak corresponds to the pion events, the right peak -- the electron events.

We have estimated by extrapolation of the fitted pion peak curve to the region of the electron peak (Figs. 3) that the contamination of the pion events in the electron events does not exceed the 0.2 % level.

### Electron selection using the Cherenkov counter

At energies \(\leq\) 20 GeV there is a bad separation with the \(C_{i}\) and \(E_{cut}\) (contaminations about 10 % ). This situation is greatly improved by using the Cherenkov (\(\tilde{\rm C}_{1}\)) counter signal cut. Fig. 4 shows the typical scatter plots of \(E_{cut}\) versus \(\tilde{\rm C}_{1}\) (left) and \(C_{i}\) versus \(\tilde{\rm C}_{1}\) (right). The top right regions are the electron events, the bottom left regions are the pion events.

The developed method has allowed to decide the task of obtaining of the clean samples of the electron events for the calibration of modules of the tile calorimeter.

## 4 Calorimeter response to electrons

As to electron response the Tile calorimeter is complicated object. It may be imagined as a continuous set of calorimeters with the variable iron and scintillator thicknesses (from 81 to 28 mm for iron and from 17 to 6 mm for scintillator for \(10^{o}\geq\theta\leq 30^{o}\)) [13]. Therefore the electron response is afunction of an impact point, an incidence angle, a beam energy. The electron energy response spectrum for given run (beam has the transversal spread \(\pm 15\) mm) as a rule is non-Gaussian and in some cases is far from Gaussian as can be seen in these examples (Fig. 5, left).

The mean normalized electron responses as a function of an impact point \(Z\) coordinate (Fig. 5, right) are well described by the sine function:

\[f(Z)=P_{2}+P_{1}\sin\left(2\pi Z/P_{3}+P_{4}\right)\,. \tag{3}\]

The electron response have been extracted from such distributions for cell-scan and \(\eta\)-scan. For tile-scan we extracted electron signal from energy distribution because at \(90^{o}\) our calorimeter have conventional sandwich structure.

Figure 4: The scatter plots of \(E_{cut}\) versus \(\check{\rm C}_{1}\) (left) and \(C_{i}\) versus \(\check{\rm C}_{1}\) (right) for \(E=20~{}GeV\).

PMT signal reconstruction methods

For obtaining of the channel response the registered PMT signals are treated by two methods: the flat filter and fit filter ones [14, 15]. The response of the flat filter method, \(R_{flat}\), is an integral, a maximum of all possible sums of 5 subsequent samples of the pulse shape of a PMT signal which is sampled 9 times with the 25 ns interval

\[R_{flat}=C_{cis}\cdot\max\left(\sum_{i=j}^{j+4}(s_{i}-s_{1})\right). \tag{4}\]

The first sample (\(s_{1}\)) is considered as a pedestal and its value is subtracted from all other samples (\(s_{i}\)). Here \(C_{cis}\) is the constant transforming the ADC values into pC derived from CIS (Charge Injection System) events, \(j=1,\ \dots,\ 5\). As a consequence of finding the maximum, the flat filter method exhibits positive offset for the pedestal-like events. For majority of PMTs this offset, \(<R_{noise}>\), and \(RMS_{noise}\) do not exceed 0.016 pC and 0.06 pC, correspondingly, amounts to 0.01 pC and 0.05 pC, in average, as can be seen in Fig. 6. But there are tails, 10 % PMTs are with larger noise. Because of this, at using the method of cutting noise (in which the PMT channel signal is set equal to 0 if the value of signal less than \(Cut_{noise}\) value, with a typical value of 0.1 pC) the calibration constants at low energies (10-20 GeV) become dependent from a value of \(Cut_{noise}\) as shown in Fig. 6 (bottom). The data at high energy (180 GeV) are unsensitive to the value of \(Cut_{noise}\), as expected.

We have devised the following algorithm correcting this defect. If the value of signal less than \(3\cdot RMS_{noise,i}\) then the one is decreased on the value of \(<R_{noise,i}>\). So, we obtain unshifted values of \(<R_{noise,i}>\).

The fit method is based on fitting the pulse shape function, f(t), to samples (\(s_{i}\)) of event

\[f(t)=R_{fit}\cdot g(t-\tau)+ped, \tag{5}\]

where \(g(t-\tau)\) is the known normalized pulse shape function, \(t\) is time, \(\tau\) is the phase (peak position in time), "\(ped\)" is a pedestal. So, the reconstructed response, \(R_{fit}\), is the amplitude of the PMT signal. The fit method results only in a very small offset (typical values are 0.0002 pC per PMT) and smaller spread, \(<RMS_{noise,i}>\) is 0.02 pC.

## 6 Electron energy linearity

One of the important characteristics of the calorimeter is the energy linearity. Fig. 7 shows the typical dependencies of the electron response from the beam energy. The linearities are sufficiently good, the RMS values are about 1 %.

## 7 Energy calibration in electromagnetic scale

Since the electron calibration constants will be used for the hadron energy reconstruction we have summed the energy depositions in the cells inside of the cone with the radius \(\Delta R=\sqrt{\Delta\phi^{2}+\Delta\eta^{2}}=0.4\) for single hadrons and

\(\Delta R=0.7\) for jets [3, 16]. For a tile calorimeter module \(\Delta\phi\) is 0.1 and for \(\Delta R=0.4\) we take \(\Delta\eta=0.4\).

The calorimeter has been exposed in electron beams in the framework of the following scans: cell-scan at \(\theta=20^{o}\), \(\eta\)-scan, and tilerow scan at \(\theta=90^{o}\). We give below some typical examples of the obtained electromagnetic energy calibration constants as a function of cell number, \(\eta\) and tilerow number.

We put together the calibration constants obtained by us for the July 2002 and July 2003 testbeam runs for the ANL-30, ANL-44, IFA-27, IFA-42, JINR-27 and JINR-55 Modules for \(\theta=20^{o}\) (Fig. 12, right bottom). The average value is equal to \(\langle R_{e}\rangle=1.155\pm 0.002\) pC/GeV and \(RMS=2.4\pm 0.1\) %. The mean and RMS values are given in Table 1.

### Transition effect

The transition effect [17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22] contains in the following. The electrons inside the electromagnetic shower produce many low energy photons (with typical energies in the MeV region) when traversing the absorber. These low energy photons lead to low energy electrons by Compone, photoelectric or pair pro

duction effects. Low energy electrons have a short range (about mm in iron)and stay mostly in the absorber. If the sampling frequency (the number of active layers per radiation length of material) increases the boundary surface between the active and passive layers increases too, and a correspondingly larger fraction of these soft electrons will contribute to the response.

This effect has been studied with EGS4 Monte Carlo simulations. Some results as the e/mip ratio, the ratio of the response of a calorimeter to electromagnetic showers to that of minimum ionizing particles depositing the same energy, as a function of the absorber thickness for Fe and Cu calorimeters with scintillator readout are shown in Fig 13. As can be seen, when the thickness decreases the e/mip ratio increases.

The observed 4 % difference in our data between the \(90^{o}\) (\(t_{abs}=0.8~{}X_{0}\)) and \(20^{o}\) (\(t_{abs}=2.3~{}X_{0}\)) data agrees with the one (4.4 %) for the two right points

### Calibration of high and low gain channels

The Tile Calorimeter digitizer system uses the bi-linear approach with two separate high and low gain channels [23]. The PMT signal after the shaper is split in two ways: the first one (for energies more than 20 GeV) is feed directly to the input of the ADC (low gain), while the second (for energies less or equal 20 GeV) is first amplified and then feed to the same type of ADC (high gain). The amplification factor between the low and high gains is set about 64. Therefore, it is necessary to determine the separate calibration constants for these two channels.

Fig. 14 shows the distributions of the calibration constants for the high gain (left) and low gain (right) channels. The mean value for the high gain channel calibration constants is (1.6\(\pm\)0.4) % less than for the low gain one.

### Uniformity of the calibration constants

We have studied the uniformities of the response to electrons for cells (at \(\theta=20^{o}\)) and tilerows (at \(\theta=90^{o}\)) and compared with the data for Cs-calibration and muon response [24]. The results for EBM\(-\) (IFA-015) and EBM\(+\) (IFA-024) Modules are given in Table 2 and Table 3.

As can be seen, the Cs intercalibration of cells due to adjusting the HV of the corresponding PMTs is very good (smaller than 0.5 %).

### Comparison of the calibration constants for two methods

We have made the comparison of the calibration constants obtained by two reconstruction methods. Below some examples of this comparison are given.

Fig. 15 shows the shifted (normalized to 1) calibration constants for two methods for Barrel Module (JINR-27) at 180 GeV for \(\theta=20^{o}\) as a function of a front face cell (A-cell) number. As can be seen, the corresponding shifted calibration constants coincide for these methods within the errors.

Fig. 16 shows the ratios of the calibration constants, \(E_{FFM}/E_{LSFT}\), for \(EBM\pm\) (ANL-03, ANL-23) at 180 GeV at \(\theta=90^{o}\) for two methods as a function of a Tile number.

As can be seen, the \(RMS/R_{e}\) values of the calibration constant distributions for these two methods are about the same amount, correspondingly, and the RMS values of ratios of calibration constants are in the range 1 - 2 %. So, it is possible to determine electron calibration constants by any of these methods and if it is necessary only to renormalize the obtained constants.

### Comparison of the Cs and muon calibrations

We have compared the electron calibration data with the muon and Cs data [24]. The results of this comparison as a function of a tilerow number are shown in Fig. 17.

Fig. 18 demonstrates the electron - muon and electron - Cs correlations.

The correlation coefficients calculated as

\[q=\frac{\frac{1}{n-1}\sum\limits_{i=1}^{n}(R_{i}^{e}-\overline{R^{e}})(R_{i}^{ b}-\overline{R^{b}})}{s_{e}\cdot s_{b}}, \tag{6}\]

where \(e\) - electron, \(b=\mu,\ Cs\); \(R^{e}\) (\(R^{b}\)) is the normalized response, \(s_{e}\) (\(s_{b}\)

is the corresponding RMS, are given in Table 5. As can be seen, the strong correlations are observed.

The straight line in Fig. 18 (right) obtained by fitting to the data represents the transfer function from the Cs calibration to the electron one. Thus, the possibility to determine the electron calibration constants from the Cs calibration data has been demonstrated.

Electron energy resolution

The important characteristic of the calorimeter is the electromagnetic energy resolution. We have studied this question in detail. The usual practice of the determination of the resolution is to fit an energy distribution by Gaussian. But this is not our case at angles are distinguished from \(90^{o}\) because of the longitudinal displacement of tiles which leads to the sine response. Therefore, we have extracted the mean relative electron energy resolutions, \(\sigma/E\), from the distributions of \(RMS/E\) as a function of the impact point \(Z\) coordinate for each A-cell at various energies. It turned out that such relative \(RMS/E\) values almost independent from the impact point \(Z\) coordinate

The typical distributions characterizing the electron energy resolution are shown in the next Figures. Fig. 19(all up, left and middle bottom) demonstrates the electron energy resolutions of BM\(-\) (JINR-55) at \(\theta=20^{o}\) as a function of A-cells. Fig. 20 shows the \(\sigma/E\) values for BM module (JINR-01) for \(\theta=90^{o}\) as a function of a tilrow number. As can be seen, the fit method provides 30 % better energy resolution than the flat filter one.

Figure 19: The electron energy resolutions for the A-cells of BM\(-\) (JINR-55) at \(\theta=20^{o}\).

We have fitted the electron energy resolution data by the quadratic fit expression:

\[\sigma/E=a/\sqrt{E}\oplus b \tag{7}\]

and the linear fit expression:

\[\sigma/E=a/\sqrt{E}+b. \tag{8}\]

Fig. 21 shows the electron energy resolution as a function of energy for barrel module at \(\theta=20^{o}\) and the results of these fits. As can be seen, both fits satisfactorily describe the data. The values of parameters \(a\) and \(b\) are bigger for the quadratic fit than the linear one.

Fig. 22 shows the obtained parameters of the quadratic fit for all scans data, the prototype data [13] and the \(90^{o}\) data from [3, 26] as a function of \(\theta\) angle. As can be seen, the parameters \(a_{s}\) and \(b_{s}\) decrease as \(\theta\) increase. The parameter \(a_{s}\) for the prototype [13] is greater than for production modules. The parameter \(b_{s}\) is of about 5 % at small angles and decreases to 1 - 2 % at \(90^{o}\). It may be connected with the unconventional orientation of the scintillating tiles which are along incident particles. The curve in the Fig. 22 (left) is the modified parameterization (9) from [27] described below, Fig. 22 (right) is given only to guide the eye. Fig. 23 shows the same for the linear fit.

We have compared our results on energy resolution with the parametrization suggested in [27]:

\[\frac{\sigma}{E}=\frac{a_{calc}}{\sqrt{E}}=\frac{\sigma_{0}}{\sqrt{E}}\left( \frac{t}{X_{Fe}}\right)^{\gamma}\left(\frac{s}{X_{S}}\right)^{-\delta}, \tag{9}\]

where in our case \(\sigma_{0}=6.33\)\(\%GeV^{1/2}\), \(\gamma=0.62\), \(\delta=0.21\) are the parameters, \(X_{Fe}\), and \(X_{S}\) are the radiation lengths of iron and scintillator, \(t\) and \(s\) are the thicknesses of iron and scintillator. In our case \(t=14\)\(mm/\sin\theta\) and \(s=3\)\(mm/\sin\theta\). This formula is purely empirical and the parameters have been determined by fitting the Monte Carlo EGS4 data. The accuracy of this formula is 10 %.

Figure 22: The dependencies of the parameters \(a_{s}\) and \(b_{s}\) for the quadratic fit as a function of \(\theta\) angle. The symbols denote the following: open circles are the \(\eta\) – scan data, a solid circle is \(20^{o}\) data, a solid square is \(90^{o}\) data, triangles are the prototype data [13], the star is the \(90^{o}\) data from [3, 26]. Left: The solid curve is the parameterization (9) with the parameter \(\sigma_{0}\) increased on 25 %. The dotted curves denote the \(\pm 10\) % error corridor. Right: The curve is similar (10) and given only to guide the eye.

According to (9), the electron energy resolution is directly proportional to the iron thickness and inversely proportional to the scintillator thickness. Because of the triple difference in the values of power the absorber thickness plays a dominant role in the quantity of the electron energy resolution.

In our case this formula can be represented as a function of \(\theta\) angle:

\[\frac{\sigma}{E}=\frac{15.6\ [\%GeV^{1/2}]}{\sqrt{E}\cdot(\sin\theta)^{0.41}}. \tag{10}\]

This function is shown in Fig. 22 - 23. As the angle decreases, the resolution increases.

As can be seen in Fig. 23, for the linear fit the agreement is observed within the errors between the experimental and Monte Carlo results, except the prototypes points. It is necessary to note that the Monte Carlo calculations in [27] have been performed for the iron - scintillator thicknesses of \(t\leq\) 35 mm and \(s\leq\) 10 mm. It means in our case \(\theta<25^{o}\). So, this parameterization is more extended than expected. As for the quadratic fit (Fig. 22) we have been forced to increase the parameter \(\sigma_{0}\) in (9) on 25 % in order to achieve the agreement with the real data.

## 9 Calorimeter non-compensation

An important characteristics of a calorimeter is the \(e/h\) ratio, an intrinsic non-compensation of one. The \(e/h\) value is the ratio of the calorimeter responses to the electromagnetic (\(e\)) and non-electromagnetic (purely hadronic) components (h) of hadron showers. The value \(e/h\neq 1\) causes deviation from

Figure 23: The dependencies of the parameters \(a\) and \(b\) for the linear fit as a function of \(\theta\) angle. The symbols are the same as in Fig. 22. Left: The solid curve is the parameterization (10) and the dotted curves denote the \(\pm 10\) % error corridor. Right: The curve is similar (10) and given only to guide the eye.

linearity in the hadronic response versus energy, besides broadening the energy resolution [18]. The value of the \(e/h\) ratio depends on a big number of factors, among them, the thickness of the passive layers, the thickness of the active layers, the sampling fraction [28].

We have determined the \(e/h\) ratios of the Module-0 of the ATLAS Tile iron-scintillator barrel hadron calorimeter for five values of pseudorapidity \(\eta\) in the range of \(-0.55\leq\eta\leq-0.15\) for the beam energy range from 10 GeV to 300 GeV on the basis of the July 1999 test beam data [29].

Special attention has been devoted to rejecting of the pion events with the energy leakage. For this we have used three cuts. The first cut rejected the events in which \(N_{BMW}\) is greater than 3, where \(N_{BMW}\) is the number of counters inside the Back Muon Wall (BMW) hodoscope with signal greater than 0.7 mip. The second cut rejected the events in which the relative energy deposition in the first depth sampling is less than 0.15. The third cut rejected the events in which the total relative energy deposition in the first and second samplings and in 1m prototype modules is smaller than 50 %.

The responses obtained for \(e\) and \(\pi\) give the possibility to determine the \(e/h\) ratio, an intrinsic non-compensation of a calorimeter. In our case the \(e/\pi\) ratios reveal complicated structures \(e/\pi=f(E,\Theta,Z)\).

Fig. 24 (left) shows the typical \(e/\pi\) ratio as a function of \(Z\) coordinate. Such dependencies have been fitted by the sine function.

The extracted mean \(e/\pi\) ratios are shown in Fig. 24 (middle) as an example for \(\eta=-0.45\) as a function of the beam energy. The errors include statistical errors and a systematic error of 1 %, added in quadrature.

Figure 24: The \(e/\pi\) ratio as a function of \(Z\) coordinate for 100 \(GeV\) at \(\eta=-0.45\) (left). The \(e/\pi\) ratio as a function of the beam energy for \(\eta=-0.45\) where the solid (dashed) lines are the fits with the Wigmans (Groom) parameterization of \(f_{\pi^{o}}(E)\) (right).

For extracting the \(e/h\) ratio we have used the relation between the \(e/h\) ratio and the \(e/\pi\) ratio is:

\[e/\pi=\frac{\langle E_{e}\rangle}{\langle E_{\pi}\rangle}=\frac{e/h}{1+(e/h-1) \cdot f_{\pi^{o}}}\, \tag{11}\]

where \(f_{\pi^{0}}\) is the average fraction of the energy of the incident hadron going into \(\pi^{o}\) production [28]. There are two analytic forms for the intrinsic \(\pi^{o}\) fraction suggested by Groom [30]

\[f_{\pi^{o}}=1-\left(\frac{E}{E^{\prime}_{o}}\right)^{m-1} \tag{12}\]

and Wigmans [28]

\[f_{\pi^{o}}=k\cdot\ln\left(\frac{E}{E^{\prime}_{o}}\right)\,, \tag{13}\]

where \(E^{\prime}_{o}=1\) GeV, \(m=0.85\), \(k=0.11\).

The \(e/\pi\) ratio and the pion response and its fitting of the expressions (11) with the Wigmans (solid line) and Groom (dashed line) parameterizations of \(f_{\pi^{o}}(E)\) are shown in Fig. 24 (right) as a function of the beam energy.

The obtained values of the \(e/h\) ratios are shown in Fig. 25. These \(e/h\) ratios demonstrate independence from \(\eta\) value. The mean value is \(e/h=1.362\pm 0.006\), which agrees with the Monte Carlo calculations, \(e/h_{MC}=1.40\pm 0.013\), within the errors [31]. The results are compared with the experimental data

of TILECAL 1 m prototype modules [13], and with the 1996 test beam data of the Module-0 [32] and agree with them. The values of the \(e/h\) obtained for production modules [33] are in agreement with our previous results.

## 10 Pion performance for calorimeter modules

Since the Tilecal is a hadronic calorimeter, an important question is its hadronic calibration. Unfortunately, in the given setup the significant (about 10 %) part of hadronic energy leaks out. We have tried to solve this problem by the following way.

For the pion energy reconstruction the expression [34] has been used:

\[E_{\pi}=\frac{1}{R_{e}}\cdot\frac{e}{\pi}\cdot R_{\pi}, \tag{14}\]

where \(R_{e}\) is an electron calibration constant, \(R_{\pi}\) is the pion response, \(e/\pi\) ratio is given by (11).

Fig. 26 shows the normalized reconstructed pion energy (\(E/E_{beam}\)) as a function of \(\eta\). The mean one amounts to \(0.89\pm 0.01\) for \(1.05\leqslant|\eta|\leqslant 1.35\) at 180 GeV. The ones for 20 and 50 GeV agree with this value within the errors. So, the lateral energy leakage for one module equals to about 10 %.

Fig. 27 shows the normalized reconstructed pion energy as a function of a tilerow number. The energy in the boundary tilteows (1 and 11) are smaller then in the rest ones because of the additional lateral leakage. The mean normalized reconstructed pion energies for \(2\leqslant tile\leqslant 10\) amount to \(0.91\pm 0.01\) at 20 GeV and \(0.93\pm 0.01\) at 180 GeV.

Figure 26: The normalized pion energy as a function of \(\eta\) for 180 GeV (black circles), 50 GeV (open circles) and 20 GeV (squares).

We have compared the pion reconstruction for Barrel Module (JINR-01) at 180 GeV for \(\theta=90^{o}\) at different tilerows for the flat filter and fit filter methods. Fig. 28 shows this comparison. As can be seen, the values of the reconstructed energies for these two methods coincide within the errors.

We have studied the pion energy resolution for one module.

Fig. 29 shows the pion energy resolution as a function of \(\eta\). The mean one for 180 GeV for EBM\(-\) and EBM\(+\) is equal to \((6.0\pm 0.3)\%GeV^{1/2}\) and comparable with the value \((4.8\%GeV^{1/2})\) expected from the required overall physics performance \(\sigma/E=50\%GeV^{1/2}/\sqrt{E}\oplus 3\%\)[4].

Fig. 30 shows the pion energy resolution for EBM\(-\) (IFA-024) and EBM\(+\) (IFA-015) at 20 and 180 GeV for \(\theta=90^{o}\) as a function of a tilerow number. The mean ones are equal to \((12.4\pm 0.4)\) % for 20 GeV and \((6.56\pm 0.02)\) % for 180 GeV. The data for \(\eta=-1.35\) (\(\theta=61^{o}\)) are also shown at tilerow number

equals to 0, which coincide with the ones for \(\theta=90^{o}\).

## 11 Conclusions

With the aim of establishing of an electromagnetic energy scale of the ATLAS Tile calorimeter and understanding of performance of the calorimeter to electrons 12 % of modules have been exposed in electron beams with various energies by three possible ways: cell-scan at \(\theta=20^{o}\) at the centers of the front face cells, \(\eta\)-scan and tilerow scan at \(\theta=90^{o}\) for the module side cells.

We have extracted the electron calibration constants and the electron energy resolutions of the EBM\(-\), EBM+ and BM Modules of the ATLAS Tile Calorimeter at energies E = 10, 20, 50, 100 and 180 GeV and \(\theta=20^{o}\) and \(90^{o}\) and \(\eta\) scan from the testbeam run data. The average electron calibration

constants equal to \(\langle R_{e}\rangle=1.157\pm 0.002\) pC/GeV, \(RMS=2.6\pm 0.2\) % for \(\theta=20^{o}\) and \(\langle R_{e}\rangle=1.196\pm 0.005\) pC/GeV, \(RMS=5.7\pm 0.3\) % for \(\theta=90^{o}\). The calibration constants for \(\theta=90^{o}\) are of 4 % larger the ones for \(\theta=20^{o}\). This fact should be taken into account at creating of the transfer function from the \(90^{o}\) Cs calibration data to the \(20^{o}\) electron calibration constants for Modules unexposed in test beam runs. The energy linearities of modules are within RMS = 1 % for \(\theta=20^{o}\) and 2.5 % for \(\theta=90^{o}\). Uniformities for the electron response are in the range of 1 - 2 % for cells and about 4 % for tilerows and coincide with the corresponding muon data. The correlation between the electron constants and the Cs and muon constants has been observed for the tile scan. The correlation coefficients are about of 0.7.

The electromagnetic energy resolution has been studied. We have determined the statistical and constant terms for the electron energy resolution by fitting of the expressions \(\sigma/E=a/\sqrt{E}\oplus b\) and \(\sigma/E=a/\sqrt{E}+b\) to the obtained data. The parameters for the quadratic fit are equal to \(a=29\pm 1.6\) % \(GeV^{1/2}\), \(b=3\pm 0.4\) at \(\theta=20^{o}\) and \(a=22\pm 1\) % \(GeV^{1/2}\), \(b=2.3\pm 0.3\) at \(\theta=90^{o}\). We have compared our results on energy resolution with the Monte Carlo based parametrization. Good agreement is observed for the linear fit.

Non-compensation of the Tile calorimeter has been studied. We have determined the \(e/h\) ratios of the Module-0 for five values of pseudorapidity \(\eta\) in the range of \(-0.55\leq\eta\leq-0.15\) for the beam energy range from 10 \(GeV\) to 300 \(GeV\) on the basis of the July 1999 test beam data. The obtained \(e/h\) ratios are compared with the experimental data of TILECAL 1m prototype modules [13] and agree with them. The mean value is \(e/h=1.362\pm 0.006\), which agrees with the Monte Carlo calculations, \(e/h_{MC}=1.40\pm 0.013\), within the errors [31].

The method of the pion calibration of a single module, which uses the electron calibration constants and the known \(e/h\) ratio, has been suggested and applied.

The mean pion energy, deposited in a single module, amounts to 0.89\(\pm\)0.01 % for \(\eta\) scan. The lateral energy leakage for one module amounts to about 10 %. The good (\(\pm 1\) %) energy linearity is observed.

The pion energy resolution for one module has been studied. The mean one is equal to \((6.0\pm 0.3)\) % \(GeV^{1/2}\) for 180 GeV and comparable with the value (4.8 % \(GeV^{1/2}\)) expected from the required overall physics performance \(\sigma/E=50\) %\(GeV^{1/2}/\sqrt{E}\oplus 3\) %.

The fit filter method of the PMT signal reconstruction demonstrates 30 % improvement of energy resolution for electron events than the flat filter method and no improvement for pion events. We have compared the pion reconstruction at 180 GeV for \(\theta=90^{o}\) at different tilerows for the flat filter and fit filter methods. The values of the reconstructed energies obtained for these two methods coincide within the errors. So, for the pion reconstruction the fit filter method does not demonstrate appreciable advantages.
