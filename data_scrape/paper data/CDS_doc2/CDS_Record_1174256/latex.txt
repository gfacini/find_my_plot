The Standard Model Higgs boson discovery potential through its observation in the 4-lepton (electron and muon) final state using the ATLAS detector is investigated. Fully simulated signal and background samples were produced with the latest simulation of the ATLAS detector. The samples were subsequently digitized and reconstructed using the ATLAS offline software. The analysis performance dependence on kinematic, lepton reconstruction and isolation cuts is studied for Higgs boson masses ranging from 120 to 600 GeV.

Introduction

The search for the Standard Model Higgs boson is a major goal of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). The first proton-proton LHC data at 14 TeV center of mass energy are expected in 2009. The Higgs boson mass is a free parameter in the Standard Model, however there is strong expectation motivated by precision electroweak data [1] and direct searches [2] that a low mass Higgs boson (\(114.4-199\) GeV, 95% confidence level) should be discovered at the LHC. The experimentally cleanest signature for the discovery of the Higgs boson is its "golden" decay to four leptons (electrons and muons): \(H\to ZZ\to 4\ell\). The excellent energy resolution and linearity of the reconstructed electrons and muons leads to a narrow 4-lepton invariant mass peak on top of a smooth background. The expected signal to background ratio after all experimental cuts depends on the Higgs boson mass itself. The major component of the background consists of irreducible \(ZZ\to 4\ell\) decays. The most challenging mass region is between 120-150 GeV where one of the \(Z\) bosons is off-shell giving low transverse momentum leptons. In this region backgrounds from \(Zb\bar{b}\to 4\ell\) and \(t\bar{t}\to 4\ell\) are important and require tight lepton isolation cuts to keep their contribution well below the \(ZZ\) continuum.

## 2 Detector simulation, Monte-Carlo samples, trigger and event reconstruction

In this section a brief summary of the detector simulation is presented and the Monte-Carlo (MC) samples used in the analysis are described. This includes an outline of the various cross-sections and the corresponding theoretical uncertainties. Finally a brief description of the electron and muon trigger and offline reconstruction is presented.

### Detector simulation and Monte-Carlo samples

The ATLAS detector is simulated by the Geant4 [3] software. Simulation, digitization and reconstruction are all performed within the ATLAS software framework Athena. The set of H\(\rightarrow\) 4\(\ell\) samples used in this analysis covers the mass range from 120 to 600 GeV. Simulation of pileup, cavern background and minimum bias events is performed by mixing them with the Higgs boson signal at digitization level [4], [5]. An instantaneous constant luminosity of \(10^{33}\) cm\({}^{-2}\) s\({}^{-1}\) is assumed. The cavern background consists of thermalized slow neutrons and low energy photons escaping the calorimeters [6]. The expected level of cavern background is increased by an overall "safety factor": in this analysis a safety factor of 5 is used.

The H\(\rightarrow\) 4\(\ell\) analysis is sensitive to uncertainties in the knowledge of the material distribution in ATLAS, to distortions of the magnetic fields, and to the accuracy of the Inner Detector (ID) and of the Muon Spectrometer (MS) alignment. Some of these uncertainties have been taken into account by using geometrical layouts including extra material. The layout used in this analysis includes additional material in the ID, and between the barrel presampler and strips and barrel cryostat upstream and downstream the calorimeter. The calibration of the LAr Electromagnetic Calorimeter (LAr EMC) is based on the nominal geometry without this extra material and its inclusion in our study provides a realistic systematic effect in the analysis. A detailed description of the layout used in simulation and reconstruction can be found in [7]. In the analysis presented in this note, uncertainties due to misalignment corrections are not included: the same misaligned layout is used both in simulation and reconstruction.

The Higgs boson signal samples were generated exclusively by PYTHIA [8] (version 6.3 for \(m_{H}=130\) GeV and version 6.4 for the rest of the masses), while for the background samples various event generators were used. For the signal, PYTHIA calculates the cross-sections in leading order (LO) taking into account both gluon and vector boson fusion (VBF) diagrams. Next-to-leading order (NLO) effects are considered by scaling the total PYTHIA cross-sections [9]. During generation, a 4-lepton filter was applied to the samples, requiring 4 true leptons with \(p_{T}>5\) GeV/c within \(|\eta|<2.7\). The filter acceptance and the cross-section as a function of the Higgs boson mass is given in Table 1. The number of available MC events are shown in the last column.

#### 2.1.1 Corrections to leading order cross-sections for background processes

The backgrounds considered in this analysis, together with their cross-sections and K-factors, defined as the ratio between the NLO and the LO cross-sections, are listed in Table 2. For the generation of these samples several MC generators are employed. The \(t\bar{t}\) background was generated using MC@NLO [10]. The QCD \(ZZ\) was generated with PYTHIA6.3, the \(Zb\bar{b}\) background with AcerMC3.1 [11], and the \(WZ\) background with HERWIG 6.5 [12] interfaced to Jimmy [13] for simulation of the underlying event. The cross-sections listed in Table 2 are all at LO (except for the \(t\bar{t}\) which is at NLO), and they do not include the lepton filter efficiency. The following corrections are applied to the cross-section of each process to correct for effects of subprocesses not originally included in the generators:

* an additional 30% is applied to the QCD \(ZZ\) background cross-section to account for the missing quark box diagram in PYTHIA;
* 8.5 pb are added to the \(Zb\bar{b}\) cross-section to account for the \(qq\to\)\(Zb\bar{b}\) diagrams that are not included in the generation.

The last column in Table 2 shows the events available for each sample. Each \(Z\) boson in the QCD \(qq\to ZZ\) irreducible background is forced to decay into lepton pairs (including all three flavours).

The \(Zb\bar{b}\) reducible background was generated using AcerMC3.1 [11] with Parton Density Function (PDF) set CTEQ6L, QCD scales \(\mu_{R}=\mu_{F}=m_{Z}\), massive \(b\)-quark, interfaced to PYTHIA 6.3 for showering and hadronization. The \(Z\to ll\) (\(l=e,\mu\)) decay is forced at generator level. The full \(Z/\gamma^{e}\) interference is taken into account, with a cut on the resonance mass at 30 GeV. The AcerMC dataset includes only the \(gg\to Zb\bar{b}\) process. The \(q\bar{q}\to(Z/\gamma^{*})b\bar{b}\) contribution, where \(q\) is a light quark, is not

included; its contribution to the total LO \(Zb\bar{b}\) cross-section is less than 15%. The AcerMC LO cross-section, including the \(Z\to ll\) branching ratio (BR), evaluated with the above parameter choice, amounts to 52.03 \(\pm\) 0.03 pb for the \(gg\to(Z/\gamma^{*})b\bar{b}\) and 8.64 \(\pm\) 0.01 pb for the \(q\bar{q}\to(Z/\gamma^{*})b\bar{b}\).

#### 2.1.2 Next-to-Leading-Order cross-sections for the background

The \(t\bar{t}\) sample, generated by MC@NLO, is the only sample in Table 2 that already includes NLO processes. To evaluate the NLO cross-sections for the other background processes, the program MCFM [14] is used. The overall conditions for all MCFM NLO calculations are the following: CTEQ6M, \(\mu_{R}=\mu_{F}=m_{Z}\), \(m_{b}=0\) full \((Z/\gamma^{*})\) interference. Any two final state partons are merged in a single jet if their separation \(\Delta R(jj)\) is smaller than 0.7.

In the case of the \(Zb\bar{b}\) sample, the following additional selections are applied: \(m_{Z}>30\) GeV; \(p_{T}(b)>10\ GeV\), \(|\eta(b)|<2.5\). The NLO cross-section obtained from MCFM is:

\[270.4^{+40.6}_{-35.7}(\mu_{R})^{+5.4}_{-8.0}(\mu_{F})\pm 12.5(\mbox{PDF})\pm 1.0(\mbox{stat})\ \mbox{pb}\]

where the first two uncertainties come from the QCD renormalization and factorization scales, varying independently the energy scale of the process from \(0.5m_{Z}\) to \(2m_{Z}\), while the last one quotes the PDF uncertainty, calculated by making use of 40 sets of PDFs for CTEQ6M (20 plus and 20 minus). This result has proved to be quite stable with respect to the variation of the cuts both on the minimum jet \(p_{T}\) and the minimum jet separation \(\Delta R(jj)\). The LO cross-section evaluated with MCFM on the same phase space is \(189.9\pm 0.2\) pb, resulting in a K-factor of 1.42. The effective cross-section can be evaluated as follows

\[\sigma_{eff}=\sigma_{LO}\cdot BR(Z\to ee,\mu\mu)\cdot FA\cdot K=812.1\ \mbox{fb},\]

where \(\sigma\cdot BR(Z\to ee,\mu\mu)\) is the AcerMC cross-section listed in Table 2 rescaled to include the \(q\bar{q}\) contribution, and FA is the acceptance of the generator filter, as reported in Table 2. The statistical error on the filter efficiency is 0.2% for this dataset.

The NLO cross-section for the \(q\bar{q}\to ZZ^{*}\) process is calculated with MCFM, applying the same kinematic selection on the \(Z\) boson masses as in PYTHIA (\(m_{Z^{(*)}}>12\) GeV):

\[\sigma_{NLO}=22.1^{+0.1}_{-0.2}(\mu_{R}=\mu_{F})\pm 0.7(PDF)\ \mbox{pb}\]

where the statistical error is much smaller than the systematic ones. The effective cross-section used in the analysis can be evaluated according to

\[\sigma_{eff}=\sigma_{LO}\cdot[BR(Z\to ll)]^{2}\cdot FA\cdot(K+0.3)=34.82\cdot(K (m_{ZZ})+0.3)\ \mbox{fb},\]

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|l c c c c c|} \hline Process & Generator & \(\sigma\cdot\) BR [fb] & Corrections & FA & Evts [k] \\ \hline \(q\bar{q}\to ZZ\to 4\ell\) & PYTHIA6.3 & 158.8 & +47.64 & [4\(\ell\)]0.219 & 100 \\ \(gg\to Zb\bar{b}\to 2\ell b\bar{b}\) & AcerMC/PYTHIA6.3 & 52030 & +8640 (\(q\bar{q}\to Zb\bar{b}\)) & [4\(\ell\)] 0.00942 & 430 \\ \(gg\to Zb\bar{b}\to 2\ell b\bar{b}\) & AcerMC/PYTHIA6.3 & 52030 & +8640 (\(q\bar{q}\to Zb\bar{b}\)) & [3\(\ell\)] 0.147 & 200 \\ \(gg,q\bar{q}\to t\bar{t}\) & MC@NLO/Jimmy & 833000 & & [4\(\ell\)] 0.00728 & 400 \\ \(q\bar{q}\to WZ\) & Jimmy & 26500 & & [3\(\ell\)] 0.0143 & 70 \\ \(q\bar{q}\to Z\) inclusive & PYTHIA6.3 & 1.5\(\cdot 10^{6}\) & & [1\(\ell\)]0.89 & 500 \\ \hline \end{tabular}

The number of events is given in the last column. For \(ZZ\), \(l=e,\mu,\tau\) while for the rest \(l=e,\mu\). The relative errors on the filter acceptances (FA) are smaller than 0.4%.

where \(\sigma_{LO}\cdot[BR(Z\to ll)]^{2}\) is the LO cross-section, that includes the \(Z\) branching ratio to leptons from PYTHIA and amounts to 159\(\pm\)0.05 (stat) fb. The additional 30% accounts for the correction coming from the \(gg\to ZZ^{*}\) due to the quark box, as listed in Table 2. The relative statistical error on the filter acceptance FA is 0.3% for this process. The mass-dependent \(K\)-factors used in this analysis are shown in table 3.

The NLO cross-section for the \(WZ\) background is evaluated by applying the same cut on the boson masses (\(m_{Z^{*}/W^{*}}>20\) GeV) as in the HERWIG-Jimmy generator used for the LO process:

\[W^{-}:\sigma_{NLO}=21.7^{+0.5}_{-0.9}(\mu_{R}=\mu_{F})\pm 0.9(\mbox{PDF})\ \mbox{pb}\]

\[W^{+}:\sigma_{NLO}=34.8^{+1.2}_{-0.9}(\mu_{R}=\mu_{F})\pm 1.0(\mbox{PDF})\ \mbox{pb}\]

where the QCD scale uncertainties are included. The statistical error is negligible. The effective cross-section can then be evaluated as follows:

\[\sigma_{eff}=\sigma_{NLO}(W^{+}Z+W^{-}Z)\cdot FA=807\ \mbox{fb}\]

where \(\sigma_{NLO}(W^{+}Z+W^{-}Z)\) refers to the sum of the two contributions. The relative statistical error on the filter efficiency for this process is 0.4%.

### Trigger

The simulation of the full ATLAS trigger chain allows to evaluate the impact of the on-line selection on the Higgs boson search. Level-one (LVL1) trigger objects (Region-of-interest, ROI), available in the simulation, correspond to small \(\Delta\eta\times\Delta\phi\) regions where a lepton that satisfies the online selection criteria is found. LVL1 muon thresholds are programmable in the \(p_{T}\) range from 4 GeV/c to about 40 GeV/c. Similarly to the LVL1 muon Trigger, electron/photon ROIs can be of eight types, depending on the highest \(E_{T}\) threshold satisfied. The settings in this case are also programmable. In this analysis, two types of electron/photon \(E_{T}\) thresholds are considered, \(E_{T}{}^{thres}\)=15 and 22 GeV. For both thresholds, cuts on isolation and on leakage in the hadronic calorimeter are also applied at LVL1. The LVL1 electrons/photons and muons are subsequently confirmed by the High Level Trigger (HLT). The first step is the Level-2

trigger (LVL2) where fast algorithms are used to validate the selected lepton. Events with leptons of a given quality and with energy above certain fixed thresholds are retained for a more accurate reconstruction and selection by the Event Filter (EF), where algorithms based on the offline reconstruction software are used for the final selection. The choice of HLT selection thresholds is optimized for physics performance, assuring that trigger rates satisfy the system latency. The main aspects of the electron and muon trigger systems are described in [15] and [16].

The acceptance of the muon trigger as a function of the generated \(p_{T}\) for the threshold \(p_{T}\)\({}^{thres}\)=20 GeV/c, is shown in Fig. 2. The efficiency above threshold is explained by the geometrical coverage of the muon LVL1 trigger detectors; in the barrel, the space occupied by detector feet, supports, services, etc., limits the geometrical acceptance to about 80%, while the efficiency of the trigger algorithm itself is very close to 100%. The trigger efficiencies of electrons for a selection threshold of \(E_{T}\)\({}^{thres}\)=22 GeV, including electron identification and isolation cuts, is shown in Fig. 2.

In this paper, several trigger menus foreseen for the LHC running at luminosity L=10\({}^{33}\) cm\({}^{-2}\)s\({}^{-1}\), are considered. The trigger efficiency for single and double lepton triggers, for a signal sample with a Higgs boson mass of 130 GeV, is shown in Table 4. The results are shown for two classes of events: those filtered at generator level, requiring 4 leptons within \(p_{T}\)\(>\) 5 GeV and \(|\eta|<\)2.7 (unbiased sample), and those passing the signal selection of reconstructed events, described later in this note. A double-lepton trigger with 10 GeV threshold for the muons and 15 GeV threshold for the electrons (isolation required), selects Higgs boson to four lepton decays with an efficiency higher than 97 %. In the following, the single-lepton menu requiring 1\(\mu\)20 or 1\(e\)22i will be applied as trigger selection.

### Electron and muon reconstruction

The leptons used for the efficiency studies are required to satisfy the generator level kinematic cuts \(|\eta|<\) 2.5,and \(p_{T}\)\(>\) 5 GeV. The lepton efficiency is defined as the ratio of reconstructed to generated leptons originating from \(Z\) decays. The reconstructed leptons include leptons not originating from Z decays (non-prompt leptons) and fakes, so it is important to study these candidates and to estimate the fraction of leptons coming from non-Z decays and fakes. The non-Z lepton fraction is defined as the number of reconstructed leptons matched to true leptons not originating from \(Z\) decays, divided by the total number of reconstructed leptons. The fraction of fakes is defined as the number of reconstructed leptons not matched to a true lepton, divided by the total number of reconstructed leptons.

#### 2.3.1 Electron reconstruction

The details of electron reconstruction are described in [17] and [18]. Here the electron definitions used in this analysis are briefly summarized. An electron is selected using the offline algorithm requiring:

1. a cluster in the barrel and endcap LAr EMC, reconstructed by the ATLAS offline software;
2. an inner detector track associated with the cluster;
3. cluster containment in the LAr EMC;
4. consistency of the lateral shower shape of the cluster with an electron isolated from hadronic activity;
5. the lateral shower shape to be inconsistent with a \(\pi^{0}\rightarrow\gamma\gamma\) decay, using the strip section of the LAr EMC;
6. track quality requirements: a certain number of hits on the Pixel and SCT detector is required, and a transverse impact parameter smaller than 0.1 cm.

The containment and isolation requirements (2,3,4) are satisfied using the so-called _LooseElectron_ definition. This definition uses shower shape variables calculated with the middle sampling of the LAr EMC. The addition of requirements 5 and 6 corresponds to the _MediumElectron_ definition. In this analysis the _MediumElectron_ definition with the addition of calorimetric isolation using all cells (EM and hadronic) inside a \(\Delta R=\sqrt{\Delta\eta^{2}+\Delta\phi^{2}}=0.2\) cone (_MediumElectron+CaloIso_) has been used. The isolation cuts are \(\eta\)-dependent, as described in detail in [17].

True electrons not originating from a \(Z\) boson decay represent a background to the \(H\to ZZ^{*}\to 4l\) search. Typically they are not isolated and in most cases these electrons originate from heavy quark decays. It should be stressed that leptons from B-mesons are more isolated than those coming from \(D\)-meson decays, and therefore are more difficult to reject. The isolation also depends on the event topology. The non-Z electrons are a small fraction (less than 1%) of the total number of electrons in the \(H\to ZZ^{*}\to 4l\) events. The electron efficiency as a function of the pseudorapidity \(\eta\) and the transverse momentum \(p_{T}\) for the _Loose_, _MediumElectron_ and _MediumElectron_+_CaloIso_ definitions is shown in Fig. 4. A significant drop in efficiency is observed at low \(p_{T}\). This is due to the loss of discrimination power of the shower shape cuts. A summary of electron efficiencies and fraction of fakes and non-Z electrons is presented in [17]. The total fraction of fakes depends on the isolation cut and is particularly high for

lower \(p_{T}\). For low momenta, \(p_{T}<15\)GeV, the fraction of these electrons is about 8% of the total reconstructed electrons in this \(p_{T}\) range. The contribution from electrons which do not come from \(Z\) decays is a fraction of the fake electrons dominated by heavy flavour (c,b) decays. The b-originated electrons are a factor of 1.5-2 more than the c-originated electrons.

#### 2.3.2 Muon reconstruction

The muon identification in ATLAS relies on the Muon Spectrometer (MS) for standalone reconstruction as well as on the ID and Calorimeters for combined muon reconstruction. In order to combine the muon tracks reconstructed in the ID and the MS, the ATLAS offline muon identification packages have been developed. The purpose of these packages is to associate segments and tracks found in the MS with the corresponding ID track in order to identify muons at their production vertex with optimum parameter resolution. Details on the muon system design and performance can be found in [19]. Details on the algorithms of the muon identification described here can be found in [20].

The standalone muon reconstruction algorithm measures the five parameters of the reconstructed tracks with their associated 5x5 covariance matrix at the entrance of the Muon Spectrometer. The muon momentum is corrected using an energy loss parameterization. Overall, the reconstructed track parameters with their full covariance matrices are provided at three locations: 1) at the entrance to the muon spectrometer, 2) at the entrance to the calorimeters, 3) at the perigee of the track. Standalone tracks reconstructed in the MS are combined with tracks reconstructed in the ID in the region of \(\eta\)\(<\)2.5. This combination improves the momentum resolution for tracks with momenta up to 100 GeV and suppresses the rate of fake muons. A statistical combination of the two sets of track parameters is made, weighted by their corresponding covariance matrices. Given a certain \(\Delta R=\sqrt{\Delta\eta^{2}+\Delta\phi^{2}}\) cone, all tracks from the ID are combined with the ones from the MS and the pair giving the best \(\chi^{2}\) is kept. The same procedure is repeated until no more combinations are possible.

An algorithm has been developed in order to recover muons which fail to be reconstructed in the MS (either because they are low \(p_{T}\) muons or because the number of stations is insufficient). The principle of the algorithm is based on the extrapolation of ID tracks to the inner stations of the MS and their matching to a segment reconstructed in these stations that was not yet associated to a combined track. The extrapolation is also performed to medium stations, in the regions of \(\eta\) between \(1<\eta<1.4\), where there is a type of inner stations missing, resulting in a drop of the reconstruction efficiency.

The reconstruction efficiency of muons from a 130 GeV Higgs boson sample as a function of their transverse momentum and \(\eta\), is shown in Figs. 5 and 6 respectively.

## 3 Background Rejection

The large \(Zb\bar{b}\) and \(t\bar{t}\) background cross-sections compared to the Standard Model Higgs boson cross-section, require further reduction of these processes by applying additional lepton identification criteria. A reduction well below the irreducible \(ZZ^{*}\) background yield is a safeguard against large uncertainties on the production cross-sections of these final states. One can exploit the fact that leptons originating from the \(Z\) boson decays are expected to be significantly more isolated than the ones originating from heavy quark leptonic decays. These leptons are also expected to originate from the main interaction point, while \(b,c\)-originating leptons should come from secondary displaced vertices.

In this section, a set of isolation and impact parameter cuts for background rejection is described. In this analysis the cuts have been chosen so that the expected rate for \(Zb\bar{b}\) to 4-leptons (\(4e\), \(4\mu\) and \(2e2\mu\)) is no more than one third of the \(ZZ\) rate. For Higgs boson masses above 160GeV, the reducible background contribution is expected to be less than 10% of the irreducible \(ZZ\).

### Muon Isolation

For the muon final state both calorimetric and track isolation criteria have been considered.

* The calorimetric isolation discriminant is defined as the sum of the transverse energy deposited in the calorimeter inside a cone of a given radius \(\Delta R=\sqrt{\Delta\eta^{2}+\Delta\phi^{2}}\), around the muon. The energy deposition of the muon itself is subtracted from the isolation energy. The cone energy of the least isolated muon is used as a discriminant.
* The track isolation discriminant is defined as the sum of the transverse momenta of the inner detector tracks in a cone of radius \(\Delta R\) around the muon. The inner detector muon track is excluded from the sum. The least isolated track of all muons in the event, is used as discriminant.

In Figs. 8 and 8 the rejection of the \(Zb\bar{b}\) background as a function of the \(4\mu\) signal efficiency (\(m_{H}\)=130 GeV) is presented, for different calorimetric and track isolation cones, respectively. A cone size of 0.2 is adopted for both calorimetric and track isolation as a conservative choice. Moreover, as shown in Figs. 8 and 8, the background rejection improves when the isolation quantities are normalized to the transverse momentum of the muon, thus the normalized isolation discriminants are used in the analysis.

The distributions of the normalized calorimetric and track isolation variables calculated using the cones chosen in this analysis for the signal and the main backgrounds are presented in Figs. 11 and 12, respectively. The cuts on the calorimetric and tracker isolation are chosen so that the efficiency for the signal, after application of the two cuts, is close to 90%. The selection cuts are placed at 0.23 and 0.15 for the calorimetric and the tracker isolation, respectively.

### Electron Isolation

For the electron final state both calorimetric and track isolation in the inner detector are considered. Although partial calorimetric isolation along the \(\eta\) direction is already part of the electron-id requirements, an extra calorimetric isolation in a cone of \(\Delta R=0.2\) is applied. The definition of the electron track isolation is the same as for the muons: it is the sum of the transverse momenta of inner detector tracks in a cone with radius \(\Delta R\) around the direction of the electron track. The \(p_{T}\) of the electron track is excluded from the sum. In an attempt to remove from the sum tracks originating from conversions of bremsstrahlung photons, only tracks which have at least one hit in the B-layer (the innermost layer of the Pixel detector) are considered in the sum. The track isolation is normalized to the electron \(p_{T}\). The distribution of the electron track isolation is shown in Fig. 13, for a cone size \(\Delta R\)=0.2. For the analysis all leptons must satisfy a \(\Sigma_{P\!T}/p_{T}<0.15\) tracking isolation cut.

### Impact parameter analysis

Leptons from \(t\bar{t}\) and \(Zb\bar{b}\) backgrounds are most likely to originate from displaced vertices. Further rejection of these backgrounds can be achieved by placing a cut on the transverse impact parameter significance (defined as \(d0/\sigma_{d0}\), where \(d0\) is the distance of closest approach in the transverse plane) of the tracks associated to the leptons. For electrons, bremsstrahlung smears the impact parameter distribution, hence reducing the discriminating power of this cut with respect to muons. The impact parameter is calculated with respect to the event vertex fitted using a set of tracks reconstructed in the ID. This allows to remove the effect of the spread of the vertex position, which at LHC is 15 \(\mu\)m along each of the transverse \(x\) and \(y\) axes. In Figs. 15 and 15, the transverse impact parameter significance for muons and electrons is shown. Tracks with \(d0\) significance greater than 3 are not included in the primary vertex fit, and this causes the shoulder visible in the distributions. The discriminating variable used in the event selection for \(Zb\bar{b}\) and \(t\bar{t}\) background rejection, is the maximum lepton impact parameter in the event. This is shown in Figs. 15 and 15 for \(4\mu\) and \(4e\) events, respectively. For electron tracks, the maximum impact parameter normalized to its error is required to be less than 6, while for muons less than 3.5.

## 4 Event selection

In this section the full set of cuts performed in this analysis are summarized and the event kinematic reconstruction is described. These cuts including the isolation and vertexing cuts covered in the previous section are summarized in Table 5.

### Event preselection

Events that pass the trigger selection are required to further satisfy certain lepton preselection criteria. An electron must satisfy the _LooseElectron_ requirement described in Section 2.3.1, and have an \(E_{T}\)\(>\)5 GeV and \(|\eta|<2.5\). Muons are selected by requiring \(p_{T}\)\(>\)5 GeV and \(|\eta|<2.5\) (see section 2.3.2). The final stage of event preselection requires at least four leptons with \(p_{T}\)\(>\)7 GeVand \(|\eta|<2.5\), with at least of two these leptons having \(p_{T}\)\(>\)20 GeV.

### Event selection and kinematic reconstruction

Following Table 5, in this section we review the kinematic cut part of the event selection. These cuts have been optimized separately for each Higgs boson mass considered in this note.

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:13]

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:14]

The number of expected events shown for the three decay channels combined is computed using NLO cross-sections (Section 2.1), for a luminosity of 30 fb\({}^{-1}\). The NLO cross-sections after the full event selection, are shown in Table 10 for the three decay channels separately and combined. In this table, signal events are selected within a \(m_{H}\pm 2\sigma_{m_{H}}\) mass window, and systematic errors are not yet taken into account in the significance calculation. Here \(\sigma_{m_{H}}\) is the experimental 4-lepton mass resolution, shown in Table 6. The significances for the each of the three channels, and their combination, are summarized in Fig. 32.

### Estimates of WZ and Z+Jets backgrounds

The contribution of other potentially dangerous backgrounds have also been estimated. Examples are the WZ\(\to 3\ell\) and the inclusive \(Z+X\) where the \(Z\) decays leptonically. In the WZ\(\to 3\ell\) background pileup and cavern background are included. WZ is found to give a negligible contribution to the total background: the upper limit on the expected number of events is lower than the limit on \(t\bar{t}\) events. The \(Z\)+jets process provides one of the most serious backgrounds to the 4e-channel at low masses. With the available MCstatistics (500K events, see Table 2), no event survives the lepton quality and \(p_{T}\) selection cuts. An estimate based on cut factorization leads to an evaluation of the expected number of events after the full event selection, that would correspond to one event after the initial lepton quality and \(p_{T}\) cuts. This is at the level of about twice the Zbb background, i.e. below the \(ZZ^{*}\)continuum. The available MC statistics is therefore not sufficient to set stringent limits on the \(Z\)+jets background. However, the rejection based on the lepton quality and \(p_{T}\) cuts should guarantee the complete removal of this background.

### Effects of pile-up and cavern background

The effects of pile-up and cavern background in the analysis are studied for the analysis for the Higgs boson mass of 130 GeV. The signal selection efficiencies are shown in Fig. 33, for the \(4\mu\) and \(4e\) channel, as a function of the selection cuts listed in Table 7. Table 12 summarizes the results for the three decay channels. The effect of pileup is to decrease the signal selection efficiency by about 10%, for all three decay channels. This decrease is due to a slight decrease in the trigger efficiency, and of the calorimetric and tracker isolation cut efficiencies. Part of the loss can be recovered by reoptimizing these cuts.

## 5 Systematic uncertainties

Central to the H\(\to 4\ell\) analysis is the estimate of the background in a candidate signal region. In this section the systematic uncertainties on quantities associated with the background estimation and the signal efficiency are discussed. First the theoretical uncertainties are presented. Subsequently, the impact of experimental systematic uncertainties on the event selection is discussed. Some of the systematics, like the theoretical uncertainties and systematics on the signal efficiency, affect the estimate of the expected sensitivity. Signal significance extraction from real data is affected by systematics on the knowledge of lepton energy scale and resolution, as determined for example from inclusive \(Z\) studies, lepton reconstruction efficiency, and reducible background knowledge from control samples.

### Theoretical uncertainties

The major theoretical uncertainties in the prediction of the inclusive background cross-sections are the PDF uncertainties and uncertainties related to the QCD renormalization and factorization scales. Scale

uncertainties reflect theoretical uncertainties due to the omission of higher order diagrams. PDF and scale uncertainties have already been discussed and evaluated for the main backgrounds and are only recalled here (see Section 2.1). In summary, for the calculation of the NLO inclusive cross-sections, the QCD scales have been independently varied in the range (0.5-2)\(\times\) the energy scale of the process. The PDF uncertainty has been evaluated by making use of 40 sets of PDF's for CTEQ6M (20 plus and 20 minus).

### Experimental uncertainties

Systematic effects on the H\(\to 4\ell\) analysis arise from experimental uncertainties related to the lepton reconstruction. The major contributions in the total systematic uncertainty in the H\(\to 4\ell\) yield come from uncertainties in lepton energy scale, reconstruction and identification efficiency. The impact of these uncertainties on the analysis is studied by applying variations to offline reconstructed variables. The level of these variations has been provided by the performance groups.

**Uncertainties in lepton energy scale**

Uncertainties on the energy scale of electrons arise from the EM calibration. These are considered by varying by \(\pm 0.5\%\) the \(E_{T}\) of the reconstructed electrons. Energy scale uncertainties for muons arise due to the imperfect knowledge of the magnetic field. Here the reconstructed muon \(p_{T}\) is varied by \(\pm 1\%\)These values are assumed on the basis of the foreseen in-situ determination of the detector performance.

#### Uncertainties in lepton energy resolution

The level of knowledge of the material distributions in ATLAS affects the lepton energy reconstruction. To properly evaluate the impact of this contribution on the analysis, the reconstructed electron energies are smeared with a Gauss function using a \(\sigma_{E_{T}}=0.0073\cdot E_{T}\). This extra smearing deteriorates the transverse energy resolution of 50 GeV electrons by a relative 10%. In the muon system, an additional term can be added to this smearing, to take into account misalignment uncertainties. The total muon smearing is \(\sigma_{1/p_{T}}=0.011/p_{T}\oplus 0.00017\) (with \(p_{T}\) in GeV). In the \(p_{T}\) range of interest for Higgs boson searches, the second term is negligible. The values of the corrections described above have been chosen so that the nominal resolution on muon \(p_{T}\) of 3% is increased to 3.3% after applying the extra smearing.

#### Uncertainties in lepton reconstruction efficiency

The impact of uncertainties in the lepton reconstruction efficiency can be estimated by discarding a fixed fraction of leptons before the analysis. The level of uncertainties considered here is 0.2% for electrons and 1% for muons, motivated by performance group studies.

#### 5.2.2 Material effects in electron efficiency

Uncertainties in electron efficiency receive a large contribution from uncertainties in the knowledge of material upstream the LAr EMC. Systematic effects influence shower shape discriminants included in the electron identification criteria. Examples of such discriminants are the mean energy fraction in a core of 3\(\times\)7 middle sampling cells normalized to a window of 7\(\times\)7 cells, and the mean energy fraction outside a 3-strip core and inside a 7-strip window. As discussed in [17], the presence of extra material shifts and changes the shapes of these distributions, hence reducing the discrimination power of these cuts. The integrated effect in electron efficiency is rather small (less than 2%). However the true systematic uncertainty in the efficiency due to the knowledge of the material depends on how well the material and the shower shapes can be measured using data.

### Summary of the systematic uncertainties

The impact of the various lepton systematic uncertainties on the Higgs boson signal yield and background rejection is summarized in Table 13 for the various 4\(\ell\) final states. Variations have been applied to both signal and background samples, and the analysis algorithm ran with the hypothesis of \(m_{H}=130\) GeV. A 3% uncertainty on the luminosity has been taken into account in the total systematic error calculation.

The \(t\bar{t}\)background is assumed not to contribute to the significance,The total systematic error on the signal efficiency has been included in the calculation of the exclusion limits described in the following.

## 6 Background extraction from data and significance estimation

In Section 4 the significance has been obtained assuming that the background is known with a negligible uncertainty. In this section various methods to extract the background from data, evaluate the background uncertainties, and include them in the significance calculation, are presented.

The main challenge in measuring the background for the \(4\ell\) channel over a very wide mass range (from \(m_{4\ell}\) 120 GeVto \(m_{4\ell}\) 600 GeV), comes from the fact that signal and background shapes and cross-sections vary considerably. The dominant background comes from the \(ZZ^{(*)}\) continuum. While we expect to measure the \(ZZ\) in the high mass region (\(M_{4\ell}>180\) GeV) where the reducible backgrounds become negligible, in the low mass region the significant presence of \(Zb\bar{b}\) and \(t\bar{t}\) requires their knowledge. Measurements of these backgrounds with early data will provide upper bounds in their expectation after all Higgs boson analysis cuts.

### Significance determination

Most of the systematic uncertainties discussed in the previous section do not contribute to the significance determination if the data distributions are fitted, and signal and background are extracted from the fit. The resulting uncertainty in the knowledge of the background reduces the confidence level for claiming a discovery. In this section a fit-based approach for background and significance extraction is presented. A fit of the selected 4-lepton invariant mass, using the signal hypothesis at a fixed mass and applying the profile likelihood ratio method to extract the significance is considered. The fit method, and the results obtained after varying the background shape, the fit range and even including background-only fits without the signal hypothesis, are the main subject of this section. An alternative approach with a global two-dimensional (2D) fit on the \((m_{\mathrm{Z^{*}}},m_{4\ell})\) plane is also briefly discussed.

The baseline method used as input to the combination of all ATLAS Standard Model Higgs boson searches, is based on a fit of the 4-lepton invariant mass distribution over the full range from 110 to 700 GeV. The method, whose details are described in [21], is summarized below.

The 4-lepton reconstructed invariant mass after the full event selection (except the final cut on the 4-lepton reconstructed mass) is used as a discriminating variable to construct a likelihood function. The likelihood is calculated on the basis of parametric forms of signal and background probability density functions (pdf) determined from the MC. For a given set of data, the likelihood is a function of thepdf parameters \(\vec{p}\) and of an additional parameter \(\mu\) defined as the ratio of the signal cross-section to the Standard Model expectation (i.e. \(\mu=0\) means no signal, and \(\mu=1\) corresponds to the signal rate expected for the Standard Model). To test a hypothesized value of \(\mu\) the following likelihood ratio is constructed:

\[\lambda(\mu)=\frac{L(\mu,\hat{\vec{p}})}{L(\hat{\mu},\hat{\vec{p}})} \tag{1}\]

where \(\hat{\vec{p}}\) is the set of pdf parameters that maximize the likelihood L for the analysed dataset and for a fixed value of \(\mu\) (conditional Maximum Likelihood Estimators), and \((\hat{\mu},\hat{\vec{p}})\) are the values of \(\mu\) and \(\vec{p}\) that maximise the likelihood function for the same dataset (Maximum Likelihood Estimators). The profile likelihood ratio is used to reject the background only hypothesis (\(\mu=0\)) in the case of discovery, and the signal+background hypothesis in the case of exclusion. The test statistic used is \(q_{\mu}=-2\text{ln}\lambda(\mu)\), and the median discovery significance and limits are approximated using expected signal and background distributions, for different \(m_{H}\), luminosities and signal strength \(\mu\). The MC distributions, with the content and error of each bin reweighted to a given luminosity (in the following referred to as "Asimov data", see [21]), are fitted to derive the pdf parameters: in the fit, \(m_{H}\) is fixed to its true value, while \(\sigma_{H}\) is allowed to float in a \(\pm 20\%\) range around the value obtained from the signal MC distributions. All parameters describing the background shape are floating within sensible ranges. The irreducible background has been modelled using a combination of Fermi functions which are suitable to describe both the plateau in the low mass region and the broad peak corresponding to the second \(Z\) coming _on shell_. The chosen model is described by the following function:

\[f(m_{ZZ})=\frac{p0}{(1+e^{\frac{p0-m_{ZZ}}{p^{2}}})(1+e^{\frac{m_{ZZ}-p8}{p^{ 2}}})}+\frac{p1}{(1+e^{\frac{p2-m_{ZZ}}{p^{3}}})(1+e^{\frac{p4-m_{ZZ}}{p^{3}} })} \tag{2}\]

The first plateau, in the region where only one of the two \(Z\) bosons is _on shell_, is modelled by the first term, and its suppression, needed for a correct description at higher masses, is controlled by the \(p8\) and \(p9\) parameters. The second term in the above formula accounts for the shape of the broad peak and the tail at high masses. This function can describe with a negligible bias the \(ZZ\) background shape with good accuracy over the full mass range. The \(Zb\bar{b}\) contribution is relevant to the background shape only when searching for very light Higgs boson (in this study, only at \(m_{H}=120\) GeV). In this case, an additional term is added to the \(ZZ\) continuum, with a functional form similar to the second part of equation 2. For the signal modelling a simple gaussian shape has been used for \(m_{H}\leq 300\) GeV, while a relativistic Breit-Wigner formula is needed at higher values of the Higgs boson mass. In Figs. 34 and 35 two examples of pseudo-experiments with the resulting fit functions for signal and background are shown.

The results presented in the following approximate the significance from the test statistics as \(\sqrt{-2\text{ln}\lambda(\mu)}\). In order for the results of the method to be valid, the test statistic \(q_{\mu}=-2ln\lambda(\mu)\) should be distributed as a \(\chi^{2}\) with one degree of freedom. The results obtained with the strategy described above must thus be validated using toy MC. Such validation tests show a good agreement of the test statistic with the expected \(\chi^{2}\) distribution, as discussed in detail in [21]. This allows to approximate the significance from the test statistic as \(\sqrt{-2\text{ln}\lambda(\mu)}\). The significances obtained as the square root of the median profile likelihood ratios for discovery, \(-2\text{ln}\lambda(\mu=0)\) are shown in Table 14 for all \(m_{H}\) values considered in this paper, and for various luminosities. In Fig. 36, the significance obtained from the profile likelihood ratio, after the fit of signal+background is shown. The significance is compared to the Poisson significance shown in Section 4. The slightly reduced discovery potential is due to the fact that several background shape and normalization parameters are derived from the data-like sample.

Concerning exclusion, the median profile likelihood ratios are calculated under the background only hypothesis, and the integrated luminosity needed to exclude the signal at 95% C.L. is the one corresponding to \(\sqrt{-2ln}\lambda\)=1.64. The integrated luminosity needed for exclusion is shown in Fig. 37.

The median significance estimation with Asimov data can be validated using toy MC pseudo-experiments. For each mass point, 3000 background-only pseudo-experiments are generated. For each experiment, the profile likelihood ratio method is used to find which \(\mu\) value can be excluded at 95% CL. The resulting distributions are then analysed to find the median and \(\pm 1\sigma\) and \(\pm 2\sigma\) intervals. The outcome of this test is summarized in Fig. 38, where the 95% CL exclusion \(\mu\) obtained from single fits on the full MC datasets is plotted as well. As shown, the agreement is good over the full mass range. Fitting the 4-lepton mass distribution with all parameters left free in function 2 allows the fit to absorb possible systematics. Inclusion of systematic effects on mass scale and resolution (see Section 5), and on the knowledge of the reducible background, have a total effect smaller than 4% on the significance from the fit.

In addition to the baseline method described above, different fit assumptions have been studied and are discussed below for completeness.

A background-only fit can be performed using pseudo-experiments corresponding to 30 fb\({}^{-1}\) of data, including both signal and backgrounds; the function described in formula 2 is used to describe the background, and the fit is performed over the full range 110-700 GeV, but in this case all the parameters apart from the overall normalization are fixed to the values obtained from a fit of the full MC statistics available. The signal mass window, defined for each value of the Higgs boson mass as described in Section 4, is excluded from the fit (sideband-fit), and the expected background in the signal region is obtained as the integral of the background function in the signal window. The pseudo-experiments fits provide an estimate of background statistical fluctuations and of possible biases introduced by the fit, that must be taken into account in the significance determination. The statistical uncertainty on the background resulting from the fit is no more than 6% over the full mass range.

Another method based on the sidebands consists of calculating, using the full MC statistics, the ratio \(\tau=\frac{B_{MW}}{B_{S\bar{B}}}\) between the background events in the signal mass window (\(B_{MW}\)) and those in the sidebands (\(B_{SB}\)). In the pseudo-experiments, the background level in the signal mass window is estimated as: \(B_{MW}(i)=\tau\times N_{SB}^{obs}(i)\) and the signal as: \(S_{MW}(i)=N_{MW}^{obs}(i)-B_{MW}(i)\). The resulting uncertainty on the background is no more than 5% over the full mass range. The significance is then obtained, in both cases, using the profile likelihood ratio method applied to the case of a counting experiment, assuming the background mean, and statistical error on the background as from the fit. The results for 130, 150 and 180 GeV Higgs boson mass are summarized in Table 15.

The sideband fit and the \(\tau\)-ratio method can be used to test the impact of some systematic effects, like the mass scale and resolution in the \(ZZ\) threshold region at 180 GeV, and the uncertainties on the reducible \(Zb\bar{b}\) background. The impact of a \(\pm 1\%\) variation of the energy scale on the significance from the fit with all parameters fixed apart from the normalization is of 21% for a Higgs boson mass of 180 GeV, the most critical region. A \(\pm 20\%\) variation of the mass resolution has a 7% effect on the significance. Systematics connected to the knowledge of the reducible \(Zb\bar{b}\) background have been tested removing this background from the samples used to calculate the fit parameters or the \(\tau\)-ratio, and have been found to be at the level of 8%.

The presence of uncertainties in the shape of the \(m_{4\ell}\) distribution at low masses (\(m_{4\ell}<180\) GeV) and the potential difficulty of predicting the shape in this region using the distribution at higher masses \(m_{4\ell}>180\) GeV, motivate studies where shape information is extracted from restricted fits in this low mass region. Examples are fits in the region from 110 to 170 GeV, where the background is expected to have a simple shape. In this range we perform both background-only fits excluding the signal region, and fits including the signal hypothesis, using the profile likelihood method but a simpler background parametrization (1st order polynomial). For the background-only fits we extract the significance calculating the p-value as defined in [21], using the method described in [22]. The extracted significance has also been calculated throwing large numbers of toy-MC experiments that were used to calculate the p-value, in order to validate the method of [22]. The background-only fits in the 110 to 170 GeV region give a significance of 5.6\(\sigma\) for a 130 GeV Higgs boson. When the signal hypothesis is included using the profile likelihood method, a significance of 5.8\(\sigma\) is found. The small increase in the significance is due to the inclusion of the signal hypothesis which renders the statistical test more powerful. These results for the 130 GeV Higgs boson are close to those obtained from the full mass range fit baseline method (Table 14). Independent measurements (e.g. \(Zb\bar{b}\) background) are expected to provide constraints in the knowledge of the background thus improving the discovery potential.

The fitting approach discussed so far involves one-dimensional fits of the \(m_{4\ell}\) distribution. This approach can be generalized to a global 2D fit on the \((m_{Z^{*}},m_{4\ell})\) plane. Such 2D fits, in contrast to the baseline approach, exploit correlations between \(m_{Z^{*}}\) and \(m_{4\ell}\), after a single set of cuts independent of the Higgs boson mass. Having a single set of cuts allows the extraction of the signal through both fixed and floating Higgs boson mass fits. The 2D models on the \((m_{Z^{*}},m_{4\ell})\) plane, have been obtained for the \(ZZ\) and \(Zb\bar{b}\) backgrounds. All available signal samples (for masses from 120 to 600 GeV) have been used to develop a one-parameter family of surfaces (the parameter being \(m_{H}\)) that adequately models the signal for any intermediate value of the true Higgs boson mass. Table 16 summarizes the expected significance as a function of \(m_{H}\), for both fixed and floating Higgs boson mass window fits, and an integrated luminosity of 30 fb\({}^{-1}\). These results are obtained using toy MC pseudo-experiments using a median likelihood ratio for the fixed mass case, and a p-value for the floating mass case, as described in [21]. The significances shown in the first row of Table 16 are consistent with the corresponding results of the baseline analysis shown in Table 14.

## 7 Summary and conclusion

The potential of ATLAS in observing the Higgs boson in its \(H\to ZZ^{*}\to 4\ell\) decay mode was presented. For an integrated luminosity of 30 fb\({}^{-1}\), ATLAS will discover the Higgs boson in the \(4\ell\) channel-alone

in the mass range from \(130-500\) GeV, with the exception of the region around \(160\) GeV of the WW turn on, where significances of about \(4\sigma\) were found. In the very low mass region of \(120\) GeV, just above the LEP limit, a significance close to \(3\sigma\) is expected: this is a strong contribution to the combined significance of the various Standard Model decay modes [21]. The \(H\to ZZ\to 4\ell\) channel is highly sensitive in the high mass region (\(400\) GeV \(>m_{4\ell}>200\) GeV), and in the \(150\) GeV region, where the Higgs boson should be discovered with \(5\) fb\({}^{-1}\).

The results obtained in this work include studies of the effect of systematic uncertainties on the signal extraction. In parallel to these studies, several attempts to improve the sensitivity of the channel by increasing the signal yield and keeping the same level of background were performed. Examples are the relaxing of the lepton-id criteria for one of the four leptons, the use of calorimeter for muon tagging, and application of multivariate techniques. Although the first results are encouraging, these studies are beyond the scope of this note since they are still in their very early stages.
