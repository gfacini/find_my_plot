ABSTRACT

The angular resolution of hadronic showers has been studied with the combined electromagnetic LAr and the hadronic Tile calorimeter prototypes using test beam data. The energy dependence of this angular resolution at energies of 20, 50, 100, 150, 200 and 300 GeV at an incident polar angle of \(\theta=11.3^{\circ}\) has been determined with pions at an event-to-event basis. As a preliminary result, a resolution of the polar angle for hadron showers of \(\sigma_{\theta}=((243.1\pm 8.9)/\sqrt{E}+12.1\pm 0.7)\) mrad has been obtained, which corresponds to an angular resolution of \(1.5^{\circ}\) at 300 GeV incident beam energy. The average polar beam angle has been reconstructed to \((11.23\pm 0.01)^{\circ}\), which agrees nicely with the incident pion polar beam angle.

**1. Motivation**

To improve the energy measurement of jets, in particular to improve the reconstruction of masses of particles decaying into a pair of jets such as in e.g. the reconstruction of the top-quark mass or the heavy Higgs mass, the precise knowledge of the direction of the decay-jet could be of interest [1]. In general, the direction of a jet is more or less fixed by the centre of the cell of the jet-initiator which is usually taken as the cell having the highest transverse energy. The standard jet algorithms form a cluster around such a jet-initiator cell by adding all cells above a threshold value in a given cone around this initiator-cell. This procedure favours the angular position of the jet-initiator cell as the direction of the jet. But, the original direction of the jet needs not necessarily to coincide with the direction given by the jet-initiator cell. Therefore both, the jet energy itself as well as its direction may not be correctly reconstructed by the standard algorithms. A more precise direction measurement would help to suppress contributions from the underlying event as well as from multiple interactions at high luminosities.

Also the missing transverse momentum could profit from a more precise angular determination of a jet or hadronic shower. The missing transverse energy,

imuthal and polar angle. Each module is radially divided into four depth segments corresponding to 1.5, 2, 2.5 and 3 \(\lambda\) at \(\eta=0\). The calorimeter, having an inner radius of 200 cm, has been constructed in full projective geometry in azimuth and is non-projective in polar angle. A more detailed decription on the construction and the results on the performance of this scintillator Tile hadron calorimeter using an innovative geometry can be found in Ref.[3].

For the combined test beam setup the LAr electromagnetic calorimeter has been located close to the back of its cryostat to reduce the distance between the two active devices. The effective distance between the two devices is of the order of 50 cm, instead of 25 cm as foreseen in the ATLAS setup. The amount of dead material between the two calorimeters has been quantified to be about 2 \(x_{0}\). The total depth of the two calorimeters corresponds to about 10.1 \(\lambda\). For this combined test setup both, the cryostat at with the LAr and the Tile calorimeter, have been tilted with respect to the beam axis by \(\theta=11.3^{o}\), resulting in an effectitive calorimeter depth of 10.3 \(\lambda\).

Pions of incident beam energies of 20, 50, 100, 150, 200 and 300 GeV have been used to test various aspects of the combined calorimeter prototypes. Beam elements and beam chambers in front of the cryostat are used to define the beam position and its quality. These ingredients have been used to clean the incident pion beams (f.ex. separate muons from the pion beam) but have not been used as a tool for the reconstruction of angles in the presented analysis. Also no corrections to take into account the incident beam divergence have been applied yet.

is decribed in the next Section.

## 3 Description of the Method

To determine the angular resolution, the mean position of the hadron shower has been evaluated indepedently for each layer in depth at an event-to-event basis. The mean position, \(\overline{\pi}_{kj}\), has been determined for each module k and each layer j in depth from the energy sharing between the different calorimeters cells. The center of gravity, \(\overline{\pi}_{kj}\), in the horizontal plane (polar angle \(\theta\)) of the energy \(E_{i}\) deposited in the different calorimeter cells located at positions \(x_{i}\) with respect to the calorimeter centre was calculated as

\[\overline{x}_{kj}=\frac{\sum_{i}x_{i}E_{i}}{\sum_{i}E_{i}}. \tag{1}\]

Similarly, the center of gravity, \(\overline{y}_{k}\), in the vertical plane (azimuthal angle \(\phi\)) could be determined, but has not been done yet.

Because for the electromagnetic LAr calorimeter all cells have equal size in \(\eta\) (full projectivity in polar angle), the center of gravity, \(\overline{\eta}_{kj}\), has first been determined for each layer j in the \(\eta\)-coordinate. Only then the \(\eta\)-coordinate has been converted to \(\overline{x}_{kj}\) values.

To account cells for a signal, a threshold cut has been applied to eliminate noise contributions. To clean the incident pion beam impinging on the calorimeter's similar cut s as descibed in Ref.[4] have been applied.

Once \(\overline{z}_{kj}\) has been evaluated for each module of a layer in depth the mean position in a given layer j, \(\overline{x}_{j}\), has been calculated as the weighted average from the contributing modules

\[\overline{x}_{j}=\sum_{k}\overline{x}_{kj}\cdot w_{kj}, \tag{2}\]

with

\[w_{kj}=\frac{1}{\sigma_{kj}^{2}},\]

where \(\sigma_{kj}^{2}\) is the variance of the each centre of gravity, \(\overline{x}_{kj}\). From these weighted means per layer and from the known radial \(z_{j}\) positions of a layer in depth, where \(z_{j}\) has been taken as the centre of each layer, the polar angle \(\theta_{n}\) has been determined by a linear fit to the equation below at an event-to-event basis

\[\overline{x}_{j}=tan(\theta_{n})\cdot z_{j}+b_{n}, \tag{3}\]

where \(\theta_{n}\) is the desired beam angle determined at an event-to-event basis and \(b_{n}\) is an arbitrary intercept.

The preliminary results obtained with the method described above are discussed in the next Section.

## 4 Results

As an example, the mean positions, \(\pi_{j}\), for the three LAr calorimeter layers and the first three layers of the hadron Tile calorimeter are shown in Fig. 2a to Fig. 2f, respectively, for an incident pion beam energy of 300 GeV. The last compartment of the hadron Tile calorimeter usually contains very little energy and is therefore not used in the determination of the polar angle \(\theta_{n}\).

The polar angle \(\theta_{n}\) of the incident beam reconstructed at the event-to-event basis with the method described above is shown in Fig. 3 for 300 GeV pions. The average value coresponds to \((11.47\pm 0.02)^{\circ}\), which agrees well with the nominal polar beam angle.

The width of the distributions in Fig. 3 gives an idea on the accuracy of the reconstruction of the polar beam angle at an event-to-event basis. At 300 GeV incident beam energy a value of \(\sigma_{\theta}=(1.51\pm 0.02)^{\circ}\) has been obtained which is more than a factor of 4 smaller than the cell granularity of the hadron Tile calorimeter.

Please note that at this stage of the analysis no corrections have been taken into account. Systematic shifts of the angular reconstruction can occur f.ex. from divergence of the incident pion beam, from misalignments of the two calorimeters with respect to each other and with respect to the beam line itself, from different positions of the shower maximum as a function of the beam energy and, in particular, from systematic shifts to the centre cells due to the reconstuction algorithms. It is well known f.ex. that the impact point is systematically shifted towards the centre of the module hit by the particle when calculated with the centre of gravity method.

The method decribed in the previous Section has been applied to pion beams at various incident energies. Fig. 4 shows the reconstructed polar beam angle as a function of the beam energy for pions at 20, 50, 100, 200 and 300 GeV incident beam energy. The weighted average of the reconstructed polar angle for those five incident beam energies gives a value of \(\theta=(11.23\pm 0.01)^{\circ}\), which is very close to the nominal beam angle. The tendency of reconstructing the polar angle to smaller values with decreasing energy can be explained by the fact that the shower maximum is displaced to lower z values at lower energies. This effect has not been corrected for yet.

The overall angular resolution, \(\sigma_{\theta}\), has been obtained from the width of the reconstructed beam angle per incident beam energy. The distribution of the angular resolution as a function of the beam energy is shown in Fig. 5. The angular resolution follows a rather linear behaviour as a function of \(1/\sqrt{E}\), E in GeV. As a preliminary result, a resolution of the polar angle of \(\sigma_{\theta}=((24\,3.1\pm 8.9)/\sqrt{E}+12.1\pm 0.7)\) mrad has been obtained, which corresponds to an angular resolution for an hadron shower of \(\theta=1.5^{\circ}\) at 300 GeV incident beam energy.

Also detailed studies hae been performed on the stand-alone test beam data. As an example to demonstrate that the the angular reconstruction is not an artefact,Figure 2: Distribution of the mean beam position for 300 GeV pions in the first (a), in the second (b) and in the third (c) LAr layer in radial depth; distribution of the mean beam position in the first (d), in the second (e) and in the third TILECAL layer (f) in radial depth, determined at an event-to-event basis.

and can also be reconstructed well using the Tile calorimeter in its stand-alone mode, the reconstructed polar angle for 180 GeV pions impinging at an polar angle of \(\theta\) = \(+10.0^{\circ}\), 200 GeV pions impinging at an polar angle of \(\theta=-10.0^{\circ}\) and 300 GeV pions impinging at an polar angle of \(\theta=-10.0^{\circ}\) are shown in Fig. 6a to Fig. 6c, respectively.

As can be seen from that Figure, the nominal polar angle is reconstructed again with good precision. Nevertheless, because of the large cell granularity of the Tile calorimeter in its stand-alone mode which is not helped by the small cell granularity of the LAr calorimeter the angular resolution is slightly worse, by about 30% compared to the combined mode, but still quite acceptable.

## 5 Conclusions and future work

The angular resolution of hadronic showers has been studied with the combined electromagnetic LAr and the hadronic Tile calorimeter prototypes using test beam data. The energy dependence of this angular resolution at energies of 20, 50, 100, 150, 200 and 300 GeV at an incident polar angle of \(\theta=11.3^{\circ}\) has been determined with pions at an event-to-event basis. As a preliminary result, a resolution of the polar angle for hadron showers of \(\sigma_{\theta}=((24.3\pm 8.9)/\sqrt{E}+12.1\pm 0.7)\) mrad has been obtained, which corresponds to an angular resolution of \(1.5^{\circ}\) at 300 GeV incident beam energy. The average polar beam angle has been reconstructed to \((11.23\pm 0.01)^{\circ}\), which agrees nicely with the incident pion polar beam angle.

More work is needed to estimate systematic effects, determine correction sets and to apply those corrections to the analysis. Systematic shifts of the angular

reconstruction can occur f.ex. from divergence of the incident pion beam, from misalignments of the two calorimeters with respect to each other and with respect to the beam line itself, from different positions of the shower maximum as a function of the beam energy and, in particular, from systematic shifts to the centre cells due to the reconstuction algorithms. It is well known f.ex. that the impact point is systematically shifted towards the centre of the module hit by the particle when calculated with the centre of gravity method. Once these corrections are applied improvements of the angular resolution are possible.

The angular resolution, obtainable for physics process which involves jets and masses of particles decaying into a pair of jets, is expected to have an improved resolution compared to the results obtained from test beams due to the fact that many more cells are involved in the reconstruction.

**Acknowledgement**

Many people have been working on the combined test beam data in the past which cannot be acknowleged individually. Therefore we would like to thank the ATLAS LAr, the TILECAL and the DAQ subsystems as a whole for their effort, they have been providing during the data taking period, as well as for all their support and help at later stages.
