###### Abstract

An investigation has been made of the potential of the ATLAS detector at the LHC to study the "all hadronic" decay of \(t\overline{t}\) pairs in which both \(W\) bosons decay to jets, leading to a multi-jet final state. Various kinematic variables for signal and background events have been analyzed. It is demonstrated that performing a kinematic fit of the selected events to the \(t\overline{t}\) hypothesis allows extraction of the signal above background, and subsequent study of the kinematic properties of the individual top quarks and of the \(t\overline{t}\) pairs. It is also shown that an effective way to further suppress the large QCD multijet background in this decay mode is to select a subsample of high \(p_{T}\) top events after the kinematic fit.

processes (\(q_{i}q_{j}\to q_{i}q_{j}\), \(q_{i}g\to q_{i}g\), \(gg\to gg\), \(q\bar{q}\to gg\), \(q_{i}\bar{q_{i}}\to q_{j}\bar{q_{j}}\), \(gg\to q\bar{q}\)) convoluted with parton showers. The heavy-flavour (\(c\overline{c}\), \(b\overline{b}\), \(t\overline{t}\)) content in a QCD multijet sample stems from direct production (e.g. \(q_{i}\bar{q_{i}}\to q_{j}\bar{q_{j}}\), \(gg\to q\bar{q}\)), gluon-splitting (where a final state gluon branches into a heavy quark pair), and flavour excitation (initial state gluon splitting). In the analysis that follows, \(t\overline{t}\) production was excluded from the QCD background processes. The QCD background was generated with a \(p_{T}\) cut on the hard scattering process above 100 GeV, resulting in a PYTHIA 6.115 production cross-section of 1.73 \(\mu\)b. Processes involving the production of \(W\) and \(Z\) bosons (with their subsequent decay into jets) were not included since their contributions are small compared to the QCD multijet background.

As the first step in the selection of the all hadronic \(t\overline{t}\) topology, events were required to have six or more reconstructed jets, of which at least two must be tagged as \(b\)-jets. Jets were reconstructed using a fixed cone algorithm with \(\Delta R\)=0.4. Jets were required to have \(p_{T}\) greater than certain thresholds (we present results for cuts of \(p_{T}^{jet}>15\) GeV, 20 GeV, 25 GeV and 40 GeV), and to satisfy \(|\eta|<3\) (\(|\eta|<2.5\) for \(b\)-jet candidates). A \(b\)-jet tagging efficiency of 60% was assumed, with mistagging probabilities for \(c\)-jets and light quark jets of 10% and 1%, respectively, for the \(p_{T}\) range of interest.

The efficiency for these selection criteria is presented in Table 1 (first column) for both \(t\overline{t}\) signal and QCD multijet background. Additionally, the resulting ratio of \(t\overline{t}\) signal to QCD background (\(S/B\)) (calculated with \(\sigma\)=370 pb for signal and \(\sigma=1.73\)\(\mu\)b for QCD multijet background) is 1/56 (1/19) for \(p_{T}^{jet}>15\) (40) GeV, indicating that these simple selection cuts can already reduce the multijet background to manageable levels.

## III Signal and background kinematic properties

Further progress in enhancing the \(S/B\) ratio could be sought using variables that provide discrimination between the signal and the QCD background. Therefore, we examined some kinematic variables sensitive to the energy flow in the event, additional radiation and event shape, including several variables used in the neural network analysis of the DO collaboration [2]. Examples include:

\(H_{T}\): The sum of the transverse energies of the jets in the event.

\(H_{T}^{tj}\): \(H_{T}\) without the transverse energy of the two leading jets.

\(E_{T}^{b~{}jets~{}1,2}\): The transverse energy of the two leading \(b\)-jets.

\(\sqrt{s}\): The invariant mass of the jets in the final state.

\(A\): The aplanarity, \(\frac{3}{2}Q_{1}\), calculated from the normalized momentum tensor.

\(S\): The sphericity, \(\frac{3}{2}(Q_{1}+Q_{2})\), calculated from the normalized momentum tensor.

\(C\): The centrality, \(H_{T}/H_{E}\), where \(H_{E}\) is the sum of all the jet total energies. The centrality characterizes the transverse energy flow.

\(\Delta R_{jj}^{min}\): The minimal separation between two jets in \(\eta\)-\(\phi\) space.

The first four of these variables are related to the energy deposition in the event, while the second four are related more to the event shape or topology. The normalized distributions for these variables, for \(p_{T}^{jet}>40\) GeV, are plotted for \(t\overline{t}\) signal and QCD background in Figure 1 (left for the first four variables, and right for the second four). It can be seen that the variables sensitive to the event shape provide a somewhat better discrimination between the signal and background (Figure 1 right). However, it is clear that none of these variablesprovides at the LHC the clear discrimination which was observed at the Tevatron energy [2]. Therefore, it would appear difficult to select a relatively clean signal based on cuts on these variables, or even the use of a more sensitive cut based on a multivariate discriminant, where the variables are treated collectively [2, 8].

## IV Kinematic fit

The key feature distinguishing top quark events from QCD multijet background is the fitted mass obtained from the least-squares kinematic fit of the events to the \(t\overline{t}\) decay hypothesis [9]. In this procedure we try to match, with specified accuracy, the observed jets with decay products at the parton level. In order to simplify the analysis we assume massless jets and neglect the error on the measured jet direction with respect to the error on the measured jet energy.

The reconstruction algorithm and fit procedure proceed in two steps. First, we seek to reconstruct the two \(W\to jj\) decays by selecting, from among the jets not tagged as \(b\)-jets, di-jet combinations. This is done by minimizing the \(\chi^{2}_{W}\) function

\[\chi^{2}_{W}=\left(\frac{E_{u}^{m}-E_{u}}{\sigma_{E_{u}}}\right)^{2}\,+\left( \frac{E_{d}^{m}-E_{d}}{\sigma_{E_{d}}}\right)^{2}, \tag{1}\]

using the constraint that

\[K_{W}\equiv\frac{M_{W}^{2}}{2(1-\cos\,\theta_{ud})}=E_{u}\,E_{d} \tag{2}\]where \(E_{u}^{m}\) and \(E_{d}^{m}\) are the measured jet energies, \(\sigma_{E_{u}}\) and \(\sigma_{E_{d}}\) are their respective errors. \(\theta_{ud}\) is the measured angle between the two jets, and \(M_{W}\) is the known \(W\) boson mass. For the errors on the measured jet energies the following form is used: \(\sigma_{E}/E=0.5/\sqrt{E}\oplus 0.03\). The condition

\[\partial\chi_{W}^{2}/\partial E_{u}=0 \tag{3}\]

leads to a quartic equation in \(E_{u}\)

\[\sigma_{E_{d}}^{2}E_{u}^{4}-\sigma_{E_{d}}^{2}E_{u}^{m}E_{u}^{3}+K_{W}\sigma_{ E_{u}}^{2}E_{d}^{m}E_{u}-\sigma_{E_{u}}^{2}K_{W}^{2}=0. \tag{4}\]

In general, this equation has four roots. We choose the real and positive solution which has the minimum value of \(\chi_{W}^{2}\).

Having determined the minimum value of \(\chi_{W}^{2}\) for each possible di-jet combination, we next choose the pair of di-jet combinations for which the resultant sum of the two \(\chi_{W}^{2}\)'s is a minimum. With this procedure we select the most likely assignment of the \(W\) boson decay jets, and use those to reconstruct the two \(W\) boson four-momenta.

Next, the two \(W\to jj\) candidates are combined with the \(b\)-tagged jets to form the top and antitop quark candidates (\(jjb\) combination). The energies of the \(b\)- and \(\bar{b}\)-jets are constrained by minimizing the \(\chi_{t}^{2}\) function

\[\chi_{t}^{2}=\left(\frac{E_{b}^{m}-E_{b}}{\sigma_{E_{b}}}\right)^{2}+\left( \frac{E_{\bar{b}}^{m}-E_{\bar{b}}}{\sigma_{E_{\bar{b}}}}\right)^{2}, \tag{5}\]

and by the condition that the top- and antitop-quark masses are equal

\[E_{W_{+}}E_{b}-\sqrt{E_{W_{+}}^{2}-M_{W}^{2}}\sqrt{E_{b}^{2}-M_{ b}^{2}}\cos\theta_{W_{+}b}\] \[=E_{W_{-}}E_{\bar{b}}-\sqrt{E_{W_{-}}^{2}-M_{W}^{2}}\sqrt{E_{\bar {b}}^{2}-M_{b}^{2}}\cos\theta_{W_{-}\bar{b}}. \tag{6}\]

Here, \(E_{W_{+}}\) and \(E_{W_{-}}\) are the \(W\) boson energies, and \(\theta_{W_{+}b}\) and \(\theta_{W_{-}\bar{b}}\) are the angles between the \(W\) bosons and their associated \(b\)-jets. Since we do not know which \(b\)-tagged jet is from the \(b\) and which from the \(\bar{b}\) in the event, we have two ways to pair \(b\)-tagged jets with each \(W\) candidate. We select the pairing which gives the smallest value of \(\chi_{t}^{2}\).

After this event reconstruction and fit procedure, additional cuts are applied to the quality of the fit to the \(t\bar{t}\) hypothesis, by requiring that the sum of the \(\chi_{W}^{2}\) of the two \(W\) candidates be less than 3.5, and that \(\chi_{t}^{2}\) be less than 7. The reconstructed \(m_{jj}\) and \(m_{jjb}\) distributions for signal events, for \(p_{T}^{jet}>20\) GeV and \(p_{T}^{jet}>40\) GeV are shown in Figure 2. The shaded histograms show the same distributions at the parton level. With an increase in the \(p_{T}^{jet}\) threshold, the reconstructed \(m_{jjb}\) distribution narrows around the true top mass and becomes similar to that at the parton level, confirming the expectation that effects of gluon radiation become less important with increasing \(p_{T}^{jet}\).

Table 1 presents the efficiency and \(S/B\) ratio for \(t\bar{t}\) signal and QCD multijet background after the selection cuts, after kinematic fit procedure, and after additional the requirement that the reconstructed top and antitop quarks masses lie within the window 130-200 GeV. The kinematic fit and limits on the top (antitop) mass significantly improve the value of \(S/B\) ratio so that, for top masses within the 130-200 GeV window, the \(S/B\) ratio is 1/9 for

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:6]

excluded from the generation of the QCD multijet background.

## V High transverse momentum \(t\overline{t}\) events

The isolation of a top signal can be further improved by restricting the analysis to a sample of high \(p_{T}\)\(t\overline{t}\) events where both reconstructed top and anti-top quarks have \(p_{T}>200\) GeV. To study this subsample, \(t\overline{t}\) signal and QCD background events were generated using PYTHIA 6.115 with a \(p_{T}\) cut on the hard scattering processes above 200 GeV. The corresponding cross-sections in this case are 47.5 pb for signal (or 14.4% of the total \(t\overline{t}\to all\ jets\) cross-section) and 86.1 nb for the QCD multijet background. In the further analysis we used for signal the expected NLO cross-section of 53.3 pb instead of 47.5 pb. For the high \(p_{T}\) sample, the same selection cuts were applied as for the inclusive sample of events, but the analysis was performed only for \(p_{T}^{jet}>40\) GeV. After the kinematic fit and the requirement that both reconstructed top and anti-top quarks have \(p_{T}>200\) GeV, the efficiency, cross-section and \(S/B\) ratio are given in Table 2.

The invariant mass distribution of the accepted \(jjb\) combinations for the high \(p_{T}\)\(t\overline{t}\) events and QCD background (the shaded histogram) is shown in Figure 3. This figure and the \(S/B\) ratio from Table 2 clearly indicate that the signal from the fully reconstructed top and antitop quarks with \(p_{T}>200\) GeV, can be isolated from the QCD background. Within the window 130-200 GeV the signal to background ratio is \(\approx 18\). By fitting the bins around the peak of the mass distribution with a Gaussian, we find a top mass consistent with the generated value of 175 GeV. Furthermore, a width of \(m_{jjb}\) mass peak of 10.1 GeV is obtained. For an integrated luminosity of 10 fb \({}^{-1}\), a sample of 3300 events would be collected with fully reconstructed top and antitop quarks with \(p_{T}>200\) GeV. This number of events would lead to a statistical error of \(\delta m_{t}\)(stat)=\(\pm 0.18\) GeV and provide a clean sample for the study of differential distributions for both top (antitop) quarks, and also for \(t\overline{t}\) pairs. As examples, the distributions of \(p_{T}\)(top), the invariant mass distribution of \(t\overline{t}\), and the pseudorapidity difference between \(t\) and \(\overline{t}\) are plotted in Figure 4. A kinematic property of \(t\overline{t}\) pairs is that,

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{l c c c} \hline  & kinematic fit & \(m_{top}<250\) GeV & mass window \\  & and \(\chi^{2}\) cuts & & 130-200 GeV \\ \hline \(t\overline{t}\) (\%) & 0.68 & 0.64 & 0.63 \\ \(QCD\) (\%) & 0.00041 & 0.00005 & 0.000021 \\ \(\sigma_{t\overline{t}}\) (pb) & 0.36 & 0.34 & 0.33 \\ \(\sigma_{QCD}\) (pb) & 0.36 & 0.043 & 0.018 \\ \(S/B\) & 1/1 & \(\approx 8/1\) & \(\approx 18/1\) \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 2: Efficiency for high \(p_{T}\)\(t\overline{t}\) signal and QCD multijet background where reconstructed top and antitop quark both have \(p_{T}>200\) GeV, for different cuts applied and for \(p_{T}^{jet}\) threshold \(>40\) GeV. The last row shows the resulting signal-to-background ratio.

at lowest order, they are produced with \(p_{T}^{t\overline{t}}\approx 0\) and \(\Delta\Phi^{t\overline{t}}\approx 180\,\)deg.

The difference in azimuthal angle between the \(t\) and \(\overline{t}\) as a function of the transverse momentum of the \(t\overline{t}\) pairs is also plotted in Figure 4. As can be seen, most of the pairs are indeed produced nearly back-to-back, with low \(p_{T}^{t\overline{t}}\). Incidentally, we note that cuts on these two variables could be used as an additional criterion indicating whether the \(t\overline{t}\) pairs are correctly identified.

## VI Conclusions

In this note we explored, using the PYTHIA 6.115 Monte Carlo generator and the ATLFAST simulation package, possibilities for study of the all hadronic decay mode of \(t\overline{t}\) pairs with the ATLAS detector at the LHC. Various kinematic variables were analyzed for both signal and QCD multijet background, and a kinematic fit of selected events was performed to the \(t\overline{t}\) decay hypothesis. After this fit, isolation of a top (antitop) signal was possible with a signal to background ratio \(\approx 5\) within the mass window 130-200 GeV.

Restricting the analysis to a subsample of events in which both the reconstructed top and antitop quarks have \(p_{T}>200\) GeV, the signal-to-background ratio was improved to \(\approx 18\), with a signal of \(3300\,t\overline{t}\) events for an integrated luminosity of 10 fb\({}^{-1}\). We demonstratedthat this clean sample could be used to measure differential spectra of the top (antitop) quarks, and also of the \(t\overline{t}\) pairs [11, 12].

This analysis is limited by the PYTHIA modeling of the QCD multijet background production of which involves higher-order processes that may not be well modeled in this Monte Carlo simulation. The multijet rates and topologies as generated by PYTHIA suffer from very large uncertainties [10]. Consequently, reliable extraction of the signal from the background in the all hadronic decay mode could be more difficult. As an additional check, it is planned to repeat this analysis with the HERWIG Monte Carlo generator.

An additional concern is that the all hadronic final state poses difficulties for triggering at the LHC. For example, the trigger menus examined thus far by ATLAS [5] consider multi-jet trigger thresholds only up to four jets, for which a jet \(p_{T}\) threshold of 55 GeV is applied at low luminosity. Further study is required to determine appropriate thresholds for a six-jet topology.
