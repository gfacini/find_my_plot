**A Study of U238 in ATLAS Muon Shielding**

**Introduction and motivation**

This note reports the results of the NIU ATLAS group on the fluxes of low energy gammas and neutrons, when parts of the shielding near the end cap calorimeters are replaced by depleted uranium (\({}^{238}U\)). The possibility of using depleted uranium as part or all of the shielding for the ATLAS muon system was motivated by its availability in the former Soviet Union at attractive prices, and also by its relatively high density compared to steel or copper. However, due to induced fission of the \({}^{238}U\), it is a priori not obvious whether the depleted uranium would in fact result in lower fluxes of low energy neutrons and gammas or not. We have therefore simulated the ATLAS shielding with increasing amounts of \({}^{238}U\) replacing the steel and copper used in the baseline design.

**Codes used, generation of events**

We used events generated by the DTUJET code of Johannes Ranft1, with proton - proton collisions at 14 TeV. DTUJET is optimized to reproduce observed \(p_{t}\) distributions at very large \(|\eta|\); this is crucial for these types of studies, as these are the particles which are the parents of the low energy gammas and neutrons. The secondary particles produced by these events are then propagated through the ATLAS detector using DICE/GEANT2, and then cascaded to energies of 0.001 eV (neutrons) and 10 keV (gammas, electrons) using GCALOR3. Each data set consists of 20 events.

Footnote 1: The \(\pi^{+}\pi^{-}\) cross section is \(\sigma_{\pi^{+}\pi^{-}}=1.0\) mb, which is the same as the \(\pi^{+}\pi^{-}\) cross section.

**Baseline Geometry, and variations**

The baseline geometry we used was the Technical Proposal geometry, modified as follows: there is a 10 cm thick iron shield plate in back of the end cap calorimeter, with 5 cm of clearance on each side. The resulting space deficit in \(Z\) is accounted for by making the mattress section of the inner endcap station unrealistically thin; this should not have a significant effect on the background fluxes. This geometry is referred to as TP5. The variations we considered are as follows: TP55, with the shielding plate inside the end cap calorimeter cryostat (copper in TP5) made of depleted uranium; TP56, as TP55, and alsowith the plug in back of the forward calorimeter (which is heavimet in TP5) of depleted uranium; and TP57, as TP56, and also with the shielding under the inner endcap station (heavimet in TP5) of depleted uranium. The same original 20 events were simulated for each of the shielding configurations; this should minimize differences due to fluctuations in the initial fragmentation.

**Results and discussion**

In general, it is clear from examining the figures that the more depleted uranium in the shielding, the higher the backgrounds are. The progression in rates from the baseline, TP5, through TP55, TP56, and TP57 can be seen in both neutron and gamma fluxes, and at all values of \(R\) and \(Z\), although the large flux at the smallest values of \(R\) makes the differences difficult to see in the plots versus \(R\) at a fixed \(Z\).

The differences are most difficult to see where the change in shielding is least, TP55; it can be seen most clearly in the small-\(Z\) region at \(R=475\) (Figure 2a) for the neutrons. The increase in the gamma flux is more marked. In TP56, the difference is clear over the whole \(Z\) range for neutrons, and is about 50%; the increase in gamma flux is a little larger, about a factor of 2. Finally, in TP57, the increase in the neutron flux is between a factor of 2 and 3, and the gamma flux is also increased by about a factor of 3. The small number of events in these samples means that the absolute fluxes are only approximately useful; however, the general trend as changes are made in the shielding can clearly be seen.

These results indicate that the use of \({}^{238}U\) as a substitute for either copper or heavimet results in an increase of both neutron and gamma backgrounds, presumably due to the occurrence of fissions and subsequent neutron capture. It remains to be seen whether the replacement of some of the \({}^{238}U\) by layered polyethylene and lead can attenuate the neutrons and gammas sufficiently that the baseline fluxes are not exceeded; this would be desirable if possible due to the low cost of \({}^{238}U\) compared (especially) to heavimet. These studies will be done.
