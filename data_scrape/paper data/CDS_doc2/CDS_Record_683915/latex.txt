Abstract

The data from the MPI 4x4x100 prototype, installed in the M-2 testbeam area were analyzed.The best resolution of the chamber after autocalibration was established for two different gas gain.

Introduction

The prototype that was studied in this work is an MDT chamber with four layers of aluminum tubes, four tubes in each layer, built in MPI Munich (it will be refered to as 4x4x100). Each aluminum tube has a length of one meter with 30 mm outer diameter and a wall thickness of 400 \(\upmu\)m. The gold-plated tungsten (W/Re) wires had a diameter of 50 \(\upmu\)m.

The main purpose was to test the track resolution of the chamber under different operating conditions and the autocalibration technique. Particularly, data have been taken with two different values of gas gain and therefore two discriminator thresholds. The gas gain depends on the anode high voltage and the gas pressure. In the testbeam area change of the gas pressure was not used. Indeed, the change in gas gain was accomplished through a change in the anode voltage.

A similar study for the 4x4x30 MDT chamber is performed in [3]. A comparison of the results for the two prototypes is given and the end of this report.

## 2 Testbeam Setup - Data Sample

This 4x4x100 MDT prototype had been installed in the M2 testbeam area, about three meters downstream the magnet (figure 1), during summer 1995. The readout electronics of the MDT prototype consisted of the L3 chain. The discriminated signals were digitized by a LeCroy 2277 TDC, which has multihit capability. The trigger was given by the coincidence of the large hodoscope planes at the up- and down-stream ends of the testbeam area together with a small scintillator infront of the magnet, the SL

The used gas mixture was Ar/CO\({}_{2}\)/CH\({}_{4}\) 92/5/3 at 3 bar pressure. There are two sets of runs [1] with two different gas gains and discriminator thresholds. In the first set the high voltage was about 3.368kV and the gas gain approximate 4x10\({}^{4}\). The discriminator threshold was adjusted such that the effective threshold was at the 25th primary electron (Tab. 1). In the second set, the high voltage was

(a), (b) leading and falling edge rawdata from a tube with low noise. (c), (d) leading and falling edge rawdata from a noisy tube. One can see that the noise level for the low gain is higher than in the higher gain, as expected.

Figure 4: Typical time difference between leading and falling edge of the first hit for the two data sets (same runs and tubes were used as in figure 2 and 3).

Several cuts were applied on the events sample. Only events with one or two overlapping scintillator hits per hodoscope plane, in both front and back hodoscope, were accepted. This cut removed about 40% of the initial data sample. The event rejection was about the same for the small 4x4x30 MPI chamber [3].

In the MDT prototype hits with incorrect drift time pattern were rejected. Three or four hits per track were required. Events with less than three or more than four hits in the MDT chamber were rejected. In the remaining events a track was fitted from the circular isochronus (Fig. 5). Events were rejected if the fit did not terminate properly as well as if the \(\chi^{2}\) of the fit was bigger than 20. Tracks with a bad orientation were also rejected. Finally, events were accepted only if the distance of the hits from the fitted track was within three \(\sigma\) of the residual distribution obtained in the previous iteration (see below).

### Autocalibration

The autocalibration procedure was applied separately for each run. Four patterns were optimazed for the testbeam analysis with MUBTAN:

* r-t relation
* t\({}_{0}\)'s
* wire displacement
* chamber orientation in y-z plane.

Figure 5: Side view of the 4x4 chamber with a typical event. The circular isochronous are given from the drift times and the best track is drawn (chamber’s orientation is less than one degree).

The procedure was to do a number of loops (iterations) for each run until best residual was achieved. MUBTAN performs improvement in one pattern at a time, from the above four autocalibration patterns. In each subsequent iteration it uses the improved values for this pattern. Also, in each iteration the above cuts were applied.

After a number of iterations best \(\sigma\) of the residual distribution for each orientation of the 4x4x100 chamber is given in figure 6 (the starting r-t values came from the corresponding values of the small MPI 4x4x30 chamber). For high gas gain and low effective threshold the \(\sigma\) of the residual stays below 50\(\upmu\)m.

As we see the event reconstruction effenciency and the cut effenciency in 4x4x100 MDT are bigger for the set of runs with low gas gain than the set with high gas gain. But as we expected residuals are better in the set with the high gas gain.

The distribution of the residual for the first data set with gas gain 4x10\({}^{4}\) and effective threshold at the 25th electron is shown in figure 8. The \(\chi^{2}\) probability distribution is shown in figure 9. Residual's r.m.s. and the \(\sigma\) from the Guassian fit are smaller than 50 \(\upmu\)m. Figure 10 shows the residuals of all the tubes in the 4x4x100 chamber versus the drift distance and figure 11 the residuals versus the drift distance of one only tube from the chamber. As you are seeing, the residuals are not left - right symmetric, it seems that the wires are off-center approximately 100 \(\upmu\)m. Also there is no dependence on the distance from the wire except the low efficiency near the wire.

Figures 12, 13 and 14 show the residual distribution, the \(\chi^{2}\) probability and the residual versus drift distance respectively, for the second data set, with gas gain 2x10\({}^{4}\) and effective threshold at the 50th electron. As above, residual does not depend on the drift distance and there is the same asymmetric picture. Also, residual's r.m.s and Gaussian \(\sigma\) are bigger than the high gas gain by about 20\(\upmu\)m.

## 4 Comments on the MUBTAN _r-t_ autocalibration procedure

Autocalibration is perhaps the most significant capability of MUBTAN and in particular the r-t autocalibration. The MUBTAN procedure for the r-t autocalibration is the following : from the drift time for each hit and the initial r-t relation the hit coordinate r\({}_{0}\) is found. These hits in the MDT multilayers are fitted to straight lines. The new fitted hit coordinates (r\({}_{1}\)'s) from the straight line are now calculated and were binned into bins of minimum 150 \(\upmu\)m each. For each bin in r the average \(\upmu\) is calculated and a new r-t relation is obtained. This new r-t relation is used as input for the next iteration (we refer to this procedure as "t-average" r-t autocalibration). The above process is repeated until the r-t relation becomes stable. The number of iterations needed to converge to the final r-t relation and the

Figure 14: Residual versus drift distance for the second data set with gas gain 2x10\({}^{4}\) and threshold at the 50th electron. The distribution is more spreaded than the corresponding in figure 6, because in this case the distribution of residuals is bigger.

## 5 Conclusions

Figure 16: (a) Residual after fifteen iterations with the “+-to average” procedure. (b) Residual after five iterations with the “-r- average” procedure (run 1249).

Figure 15: (a), (b) r-t relation with the “-r- average” procedure. (c) in the last three iterations the r-t relations are stable (run 1249).

From all the above it follows that there is no significant problem in the operation of the 4x4x100 MDT prototype. Data analysis shows, as it was expected, that using a high gas gain and a low threshold we achieve a better resolution. The average resolution in the first data set with the low effective threshold is better than in the second data set with the higher threshold, by about 33%. These results compare well with the resolution obtained with the 4x4x30 MDT prototype [3].

More attention should be paid to the autocalibration procedure. As we saw, a proper autocalibration procedure is crucial not only in order to obtain the best resolution, but also to converge with the smallest possible number of iterations.

Finally, no study was made of the systematics in the resolution introduced by the autocalibration procedure, because MUBTAN could not define a global track by other tracking detector (like the CSC detector).
