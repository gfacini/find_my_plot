the systematic error as well: \(174.3\pm 3.2(stat)\pm 4.0(syst)\)[4]. In [5] it was stated that this situation will be quite common for the LHC where - due to the big amount of data the statistical error and systematic ones, which scale as \(\frac{1}{\sqrt{N}}\), will be negligible. Therefore, the total error will be dominated by those components of the systematic error which arise from both physics and detector limited knowledge and weakly depend on number of events.

An attempt has been made here, to develop a modified approach for the t-quark mass measurement in this channel which allows to reduce significantly the systematic error. This approach is based on two main points:

* MC-based corrections and calibrations should be avoided in the t-quark mass estimation procedure. All corrections should be data-based.
* Special algorithms with improved stability (with respect to nongaussian errors, the presence of the mismeasurements, biases etc.) should be used for the data reconstruction procedure.

The results presented in this note have been obtained using the PYTHIA 5.7 [6] event generator and ATLFAST 2.53, the ATLAS fast detector simulation program [7].

## 2 Event selection

Signal events have at least one high \(P_{T}\) lepton (electron or muon), large transverse missing energy \(E_{T}^{miss}\) and several jets with at least two of them being b-quark jets.

According to these features, signal events were selected with the following requirements:

* missing energy \(E_{T}^{miss}>20\)\(GeV/c^{2}\);
* isolated lepton with \(P_{T}>20\)\(GeV/c\) and pseudorapidity \(|\eta|<2.5\);
* at least 4 jets with \(P_{T}>40\)\(GeV/c\) and pseudorapidity \(|\eta|<2.5\);
* at least one jet with \(P_{T}>40\)\(GeV/c\) and pseudorapidity \(|\eta|<2.5\) tagged as a b-jet.

For the event selection jets were reconstructed using a fixed cone algorithm with a cone size \(\Delta R=0.4\). Isolated leptons had to pass isolation criteria, namely that they be at a distance of \(\Delta R>0.4\) from any energy clusters and the energy deposition in a cone \(\Delta R<0.2\) around the leptons should have \(E_{T}<10\)\(GeV/c^{2}\). The b-tagging algorithm used was the one in the ATLFAST 2.53[7] package. The package labels a jet as a b-jet if a b-quark with \(P_{T}>5\)\(GeV/c\) is found in a cone \(\Delta R=0.4\) around the reconstructed jet with \(|\eta|<2.5\).

The t-quark mass has been measured using the fully hadronic t-quark decay chain \(t\to bW\to bq\bar{q}\). The decay of the other t-quark in the event with the subsequent semileptonic decay of the W was used only as a source of high \(P_{T}\) lepton and jet for the event selection.

The signal selection efficiency of this procedure for the \(t\bar{t}\) events in "lepton+jets" channel is 16.8%. The branching ratio of this decay channel is \(Br=28.9\%\) which leads to a total \(efficiency\times Br\) of 4.9% for \(t\bar{t}\) events. The high \(P_{T}\) lepton may also be produced by other sources in the t-quark decay chain (not only semileptonic W decay). This increase the detection efficiency and doesn't influence the t-quark mass measurement. Events of such type will be considered as signal events as well throughout the note.

The dependence of the signal reconstruction efficiency on the generated t-quark mass is shown in fig.1 for events generated with PYTHIA 5.7 and PYTHIA 6.1 using different structure function sets.

The main results of this note have been obtained with the PYTHIA 5.7

## 3 Mass measurement method

The main purpose of this work is to construct a t-quark mass estimator which should be insensitive to the different sources of systematic uncertainties due to the physical effects or effects of reconstruction algorithms. As a t-quark mass estimator the 3-jet system invariant mass was used. One of the jets must be tagged as _b-jet_ and the invariant mass of the other two jets must be close to the W mass. The proposed method consists of three steps:

* a "continuous" jet definition and mass estimation;
* a constraint fit on the W mass;
* a jet energy calibration based on the W mass measurement.

### "Continuous" jet definition

The idea is based on Tkachev's papers [9]. He noticed that the "discrete" nature of the standard jet definition may causes problems in the measurement of physics parameters. Some of these problems are:

* Discretisation itself gives increased statistical errors from the mathematical point of view, due to the rupture of continuous distributions. This rupture causes an instability (large statistical fluctuations) of measurement result in the presence of measurement errors.
* The transition from a continuous energy deposition in the calorimeter to a fixed jet structure causes the loss of some important information.

Consider as an example the problem of final state radiation(FSR). During the hadronisation process the quark emits \(\gamma\) quanta and gluons. The exact cone shape and size of the emitted energy for a given quark is not known. So the fraction of the total energy contained in the cone in any standard jet finding algorithms is subject to big fluctuations. In addition this energy cannot be precisely determined by theoretical calculations. This causes a large systematic error in the mass measurement of any jet system.

To overcome these problems, a method is proposed to calculate a _mass distribution_ - not just one mass value - for a jet system of _one given event_. This can be done by repeating the analysis of _one given event_ by varying the value of the jet cone sizes in a certain reasonable range. By summing up the distributions for all events an accumulations of points at a fixed position ( peak ) is obtained and such a position may be considered as an estimator of the mass of the jet system. For different events the mass values at the peak position are obtained with different cone sizes. The basic feature is that a position of accumulation should be a more robust estimator of the jet system invariant mass with respect to the single value which is obtained by calculation of only one mass for each event.

An example of such an approach is shown in fig.2 where the reconstructed jet-jet ( from W decay ) masses are shown as a function of the cone size (\(\Delta R\)) used in the jet finding algorithm. In fig.3 the 3-jet system invariant masses ( the t-quark mass estimator ) are shown as a function of the cone size \(\Delta R\) as well. The summed distribution for all \(\Delta R\) is shown in the bottom of fig.2,3 for jet-jet and 3-jet masses correspondingly.

For the case of the 3-jets invariant mass without any MC based correction ( the t-quark mass estimator ) such a procedure decreases the mass shift due to switching off of the final state radiation ( from 9.5 \(GeV/c^{2}\) for cone size \(\Delta R=0.4\) to 5.5 \(GeV/c^{2}\) ).

### Constraint fit

In the 3-jet system from a t-quark decay two jets come from the hadronic W decay. The W mass is known with great accuracy so one may try to use this additional information in order to correct the jet energies. This can be accomplished by a constraint fit procedure where the energies of the two jets are tuned so that the 2-jets invariant mass match exactly the W mass.

Usually, the measured jet energy turns out to be lower than the energy of the quark which initiates it. This means that the mean value of the unfitted 2-jet mass estimation is lower than the W-mass (the shift is clearly seen in fig.2). From statistics it is known that for a shifted distribution the \(\chi^{2}\) fitting method is not optimal. Of course one may cope easily with such a shift by applying a jet energy correction. But in order to use the constraint fit procedure with the continuous jet definition method one must have the energy correction as a function of the jet cone size in the jet definition algorithm. This is not an easy task from the practical point of view (although such correction may be obtained if needed). Moreover such correction can be an another source of systematic error.

Figure 3: 3-Jet invariant masses for the different \(\Delta R\)-cone sizes used in the jet finding algorithm. The full vertical line indicates the mass value of the generated t-quarks.

In the method proposed here, a different approach has been exploited. The robust modifications [10, 11] of the fitting functional have been used instead of the usual \(\chi^{2}\) one. Such robust functionals are less sensitive to shifts of the primary distributions.

Two robust functionals may be used for the constraint fit procedure:

1. \[\Psi(x)=|x|\] (1)
2. \[\Psi(x)=\begin{cases}x^{2}&\text{if }|x|<a\;,\\ a\cdot|x|&\text{if }|x|>a\;.\end{cases}\] (2) Here \(a=|x_{i-1}|\), being all \(x^{\prime}s\) ordered \(|x_{1}|<|x_{2}|<...<|x_{i-1}|<|x_{i}|\)

These two definitions have been selected from many possibilities not only because of their robustness but also since they are scale independent. A lot of the robust functionals proposed for the parameter estimation are based on the following idea. An influence of the measurement on the estimate decreases if the deviation of this measurement from the mean (fitted) value is above a certain limit. Such limit (_scale_) is selected on the base of the measurement errors. These errors are usually not precisely known and very often are different for the MC and real data. Therefore in order to simplify the procedure, the two robust functionals have been selected which don't require a precise knowledge of errors. The first proposed functional doesn't have a scale at all, while the second one selects the scale automatically. The results presented in this paper have been obtained with method (2) because it has slightly better accuracy.

The MINUIT[12] package has been used for the constraint minimum search. The fitting function for MINUIT is:

\[F=\Psi(E_{10}-E_{1})+\Psi(E_{20}-E_{2})+Constraint\;term \tag{3}\]

where \(E_{1,2}\) are the fitting parameters ( jet energies ) and \(E_{10,20}\) are their initial values.

The changes in the t-quark mass estimates due to using the robust fitting functional instead of a \(\chi^{2}\) for the W mass constraint fit are demonstrated in fig.4. Fig.4a shows the results of the t-quark mass estimation when the \(\chi^{2}\) method is used. Fig.4b shows the results of the t-quark mass estimation with the application of fitting functional (2). In both cases the same MC event sample has been used. For case (b) the reconstructed points are much closer to the generated \(M_{t}\) value of 175 \(GeV/c^{2}\).

### b-quark jet energy calibration

In a given event the energy of each jet depends on the chosen jet definition algorithm. The wider the cone used, the higher the energy collected from the original parton and the higher the energy from other sources (i.e. other jets) added to the jet. Therefore the invariant mass of a jet subsystem usually depends on the cone size used in the jet finding algorithm - the higher the cone size, the higher the mass of the jet subsystem. This mass depends on the detector response function as well.

The results of the t-quark mass estimation obtained by applying a constraint W mass fit to the light quark jets and a "continuous" jet definition algorithm, are shown in fig.5. Here, the differences between the generated and reconstructed t-quark masses are presented for five different t-quark masses. A clear shift of \(\approx 2.8\;GeV/c^{2}\) downward of the reconstructed mass with respect to the generated one is seen due to the absence of any kind of energy correction for the b-quark jet energies.

To correct for this shift, a jet energy rescaling procedure is needed. For the light quark jets from W decays such a correction is done automatically and in a MC independent way by the constraint fitting procedure. A similar procedure for the b-quark jets should be based only on real data itself in order not to increase the systematic uncertainty due to the use of simulated events.

The proposed strategy is based on the following observation. In the center

of mass (CM) system the t-quark decay gives b-jet and light quark jets with mean energies close to each other:

\[<E_{b-jet}>\approx 69\ GeV/c^{2}\,\ \ <E_{light\ quark\ jet}>\approx 53\ GeV/c^{2} \tag{4}\]

After the Lorentz boost to the laboratory system this feature leads to similar energy distributions for all jets coming from the t-quark decay, as shown in fig.6.

For this reason, the mean correction factor should be the same for b-quark and light quark jet energies even in the case of an energy dependent detector response function, although shifts due to physics effects, such as \(b\) and _c_-mesons decays with neutrinos and the resultant energy loss, may be different.

Figure 6: Reconstructed b-quark and light quark jet energies in the laboratory system.

In this paper, the b-quark jet energies have been rescaled by a constant factor. This factor is common for all events and is a linear function of the cone size used in the jet finding algorithm. The parameters of the correction factor dependence have been estimated during the primary run of the procedure of t-quark mass estimation on data by W mass shift for each value of jet cone size:

\[C_{corr}=\frac{M_{W}+\Delta M_{W}}{M_{W}}(\Delta R)=A+B\cdot\Delta R \tag{5}\]

Thus the correction factor has been determined for light quark jets and used for b-quark jets. This correction factor has been applied directly to the jet energies since \(M_{W}\approx\sqrt{E_{1}\cdot E_{2}}\). A shift of the t-quark mass estimate and systematic error of the estimate due to use of the proposed jet energy correction procedure will be discussed later in the results and systematic error sections of the paper.

### Practical details of the method

For each event generated with PYTHIA+ATLFAST that passed the selection criteria, the t-quark mass measurement procedure starts by applying a "fixed cone" jet finding algorithm with a definite cone size. In the current analysis the cone sizes range from 0.3 up to 1.0, with step of 0.1.

In a preliminary stage of the analysis for each cone size a jet energy correction factor has been defined by calculating the two-jet invariant mass distribution for non b-tagged jets with \(P_{T}>40\)\(GeV\). The W-peak position has been fitted. The sum of Gaussian and Tchebyshev polynomials up to the fourth order has been used as fitting function. The dependence of the correction on the cone size has been parametrised by (5). An example of the parametrisation is shown in fig.7.

Next a t-quark mass estimation procedure was run a second time on the same events. Two jets with \(P_{T}>40\)\(GeV\) have been selected for which the combined invariant mass was close to the mass of the W. The requirement \(|M-M_{W_{true}}|<25\)\(GeV\) has been applied. The constraint fit procedure was applied to these jets. The energies of the two jets have been changed according to their errors so that the invariant mass of the 2 corrected jets equals exactly the W mass. A difference in the results due to the various jet energy error definition will be discussed later in the systematic error section of the paper. The corrected di-jet system was then combined with the b-tagged jet with \(P_{T}>40\)\(GeV\). A b-quark jet energy rescaling has been applied to this b-tagged jet according to the correction factor for the given cone size. The invariant mass of this 3-jet system has then been considered as the t-quark mass estimate for the current event and jet cone size. In case of more than one b-tagged jet, the combination with the highest \(P_{T}\) has been selected.

After having a t-quark mass estimate for a given jet cone size, the cone size was changed and the whole procedure was repeated for a given event, starting from scratch with the jet finding. When the jet finding procedure was unable to find the required minimum number of jets with \(P_{T}>40\)_GeV_ the algorithm proceeded to the next event. All t-quark mass estimates calculated for all the events and all the jet cone sizes were summed up in one histogram. The corresponding 3-jet invariant mass distributions are shown in fig.8 ( see fig.3 for the same distributions without application of the W-mass constraint fit and the b-tagged jet energy correction ).

Finally the obtained distribution with t-quark decay peak was fitted with a Breit-Wigner function including a 3rd order Tchebyshev polynomial to describe the background. The position of the peak was considered as the final estimate of the t-quark mass. The Breit-Wigner shape has been selected because it gives a much better description of the signal compared with a Gaussian shape. However, an equally good \(\chi^{2}\) may be obtained by using a sum of two Gaussian with the same mean for the signal description. The difference between the results with the two methods has been treated as a systematic error.

## 4 Results

The result obtained by applying the t-quark mass estimate procedure described above is shown in fig.9 for 100000 \(t\overline{t}\) generated events.

In order to evaluate the statistical properties of the t-quark mass estimate procedure, some additional steps are needed. Due to the "continuous" jet definition method and to the data based b-jet corrections, the statistical error given

by the fit of the distribution is not the correct one. The invariant mass distributions obtained on the same event sample with different jet cone sizes \(\Delta R\) used by jet algorithm are strongly correlated and cannot be treated as independent. The b-quark jet energy correction factor is being determined on the data event sample and thus also has a statistical error which must be taken into account. Both effects lead to an underestimate of the statistical error as obtained from the invariant mass distribution fitting procedure. For the correction one should rescale statistical errors from fitting procedure. The determination of such a rescaling factor is not an easy task to be performed analytically. However one can easily determine the corresponding correction factor in Monte Carlo experiment, with the aid of the pull distribution. This was done as follows. For the each of the t-quark masses ( \(M_{t}^{MC}\)=165,170,175,180,185 \(GeV/c^{2}\) ) 100000 \(t\bar{t}\) pair production events have been generated and reconstructed. This procedure has been repeated 6 times. The results from these 6 MC experiments are shown in fig.10a) where the difference between generated and reconstructed t-quark masses is plotted as a function of \(M_{t}^{MC}\). The corresponding pull distribution for all points after the linear function fit is presented in fig.10b). The dispersion of the pull distribution is \(\approx 2\) instead of 1.0 as it should be for the precisely known errors of the \(M_{t}\) estimates. This means that all the statistical errors should be multiplied by a factor of 2. The analogous method is widely used by Particle Data Group (PDG) in determination of the error of the average of the different experiments results [13]. PDG uses the so called _"S-factor"_ for the

error rescaling

\[S=\sqrt{\frac{\chi^{2}}{N-1}} \tag{6}\]

In our case \(S\approx 2\) as can also be seen from fig.9.

In each MC experiment for the t-quark mass estimation with 100000 generated events, the typical statistical error on the t-quark mass estimate was \(\approx 230~{}MeV/c^{2}\), which leads to a statistical accuracy

\[\delta M_{t}\approx 50~{}MeV/c^{2} \tag{7}\]

after multiplying by 2 and rescaling to 10 \(fb^{-1}\)

The mean value of the systematic shift for the proposed t-quark mass estimate procedure is

\[<\Delta M_{t}>=0.18\pm 0.1~{}GeV/c^{2}~{}~{}at~{}~{}M_{t}=175~{}GeV/C^{2} \tag{8}\]

The final t-quark mass estimate should be corrected by this value.

### Systematic errors

Due to the use of a constraint fit procedure, there is no systematic shift caused by mismeasurements of the light quark jets. The situation is different for the

The points in the picture for the MC experiments at one mass \(M_{t}^{MC}\) are shifted with respect to each other by 0.2 \(GeV/c^{2}\) in the horizontal direction for better visibility.

case of b-quark jets. Applying the correction calculated on light quark jets data to b-quark jets produces not only an increase of the statistical error due to the data-based calibration ( absolutely precise only for infinite statistics ), but also a systematic shift of the final estimates due to the difference between energy scales for the light and b-quark jets[8].

The accuracy of the proposed t-quark mass estimation procedure depends on the accuracy of the Monte Carlo description of the jets. There are two main sources of the discrepancies between MC and real data jets. One of them is a non-perfect description of the detector in the Monte Carlo. Another one is the uncertainties in physics effects ( the errors in the quark fragmentation functions parameters, the errors in the decay parameters of B and D mesons, etc...). Both effects lead to errors in the jet energy scales. Assuming that all physics effects are known precisely (calibrated on the high statistics LHC W and Z production data), the only source of the systematic error in the t-quark mass estimate due to jet energy scale arises from detector effects. An upper limit on the value of such an error may be obtained as follow. The jet energy scale depends on the jet parameters (energy, direction, width) only and should not depend on the jet origin (b-quark or light quark). Thus, taking in mind the similarity of the b-quark and light quark jets energy spectra (see fig.6), a change in the MC detector description produces equal shifts for the b-quark and light quark jet energy scales. The absolute jet energy scale will be known at LHC at the 1% level[3, 8]. Thus the b-jet and light quark jets energies are shifted by 1% simultaneously and whole estimation procedure is repeated. A systematic error due to such shift is 20 \(MeV/c^{2}\).

In order to calculate systematic errors due to FSR and ISR the strategy from [2] has been adopted. First one should calculate a total shift of the t-quark mass estimate when ISR and FSR are switched ON and OFF. Assuming that \(\alpha_{s}\) is known with a 10% accuracy, a 20% percent of the total shift can be taken as an estimate of the systematic error (\(\sim\alpha_{s}^{2}\)). In the analysis developed in this note, the shift due to the initial state radiation (ISR) is negligible. On the other hand, the total shift due to FSR is \(\approx 1\)\(GeV/c^{2}\), which leads to a systematic error of 200 \(MeV/c^{2}\).

Another source of systematic error is the description of the background and signal shapes in the fitted invariant mass distribution. Changing the background description, the degree of polynomials and the limits lead a to systematic error of \(\approx 100\)\(MeV/c^{2}\). Changing the signal shape from a Breit-Wigner to the sum of two Gaussians with common mean leads to a systematic error of 50 \(MeV/c^{2}\).

The shape of the W signal used to rescale the b-jet energy is another source of systematic error. This shape is asymmetric ( because of tail in the lower mass region) even at Monte Carlo level; a better situation should not be expected for real data. The asymmetry causes an ambiguity in the evaluation of the mean W mass, which leads to different corrections. Changes in the background shape under the W peak also lead to the different corrections and then to systematic error. All these sources account for a systematic error of \(\approx 260\ MeV/c^{2}\).

One may also exploit a different parametrisation of the jet energy errors

( \(\delta E\sim const,\ \ \sim\sqrt{E},\ \sim E\) ), used in the constraint fit procedure. Assuming that this parametrisation is the same for all the light quark jets, the exact scale of the errors is not important. Such a parametrisation change leads to a systematic shift of \(\approx 90\ MeV/c^{2}\).

## 5 Conclusions

A new way to estimate the t-quark mass in the "lepton+jets" channel at the LHC has been presented. This algorithm has been specially designed in order to diminish the systematic errors of the mass measurement. It has been shown that a systematic error of the order

\[\Delta M^{t}_{syst}\approx 360\ MeV/c^{2} \tag{9}\]

can be obtained, with a corresponding statistical accuracy of \(\approx 50\ MeV/c^{2}\) for a luminosity of \(10\ fb^{-1}\).

All the results in this paper have been obtained with the fast simulation of the ATLAS detector. These results have to be verified with a full simulation of the detector. The corresponding work is in progress.
