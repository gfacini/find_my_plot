###### Abstract

This note summarizes the studies made at particle level on the search for heavy Higgs production in the \(H\to WW\to l\nu jj\) and \(H\to ZZ\to lljj\) decay modes with the ATLAS detector. It describes in some detail the central cuts applied to reconstruct the signal, as well as those used in the central region (jet veto) and the forward/backward regions (jet tagging) to maximize the sensitivity to the signal above the large QCD backgrounds from \(t\overline{t}\)+jet and W/Z+jet processes. Particular attention is paid to the evaluation of the detector performance at low and high luminosity. Recent work is also included, extending the original studies performed for \(m_{H}=1\) TeV down to \(m_{H}=600\) GeV, and demonstrating that the broad signal mass peak can be reliably observed above the background even after a few years of running at low luminosity.

Introduction

To be able to extend the search for a Standard Model Higgs boson up to masses of \(\sim 1\) TeV, one has to look for its hadronic decays to increase the signal yield, since the gold-plated mode \(H\to ZZ\to llll\) becomes rate limited for \(m_{\,H}\geq 600\) GeV. The decay mode \(H\to WW\to l\nu jj\) (resp. \(H\to ZZ\to ljj\)) is produced with a rate 150 (resp. 20) times higher than the 4-lepton mode. These modes are quite challenging due to the extremely large QCD backgrounds.

Section 2 presents the expected signal and background rates. Section 3 describes in detail the cuts used in the central region to reconstruct the signal S and to enhance the ratio S/B, while Section 4 discusses the forward jet tagging issues. The final event yields and significances are presented in Section 5 for both low and high luminosity operation.

The last Sections bring additional information with respect to existing ATLAS documents [1, 2] : Section 6 demonstrates how the signal can be seen as a mass peak above the residual background, and Section 7 extends this study to lower Higgs masses. Finally, Section 8 shows the impact of the optimization of the reconstruction algorithm and selection cuts for \(m_{\,H}=600\) GeV.

## 2 Signal and Backgrounds

Unless explicitly mentioned (as in Sections 7 and 8), a Higgs boson mass of 1000 GeV is considered in the following.

### Signal

Signal and background events were mostly studied using PYTHIA 5.7 [3]. As advocated a long time ago [4] and justified again in Section 4, forward jet tagging is needed to extract the signal from the background. Therefore, one considers Higgs production only through the process \(qq\to qq\,H\), i.e. Higgs bosons produced via WW or ZZ fusion 1.

The total cross section, obtained from PYTHIA 5.7, is 0.09 pb, yielding 1550 \(H\to WW\to l\nu jj\) events and 210 \(H\to ZZ\to ljj\) events for an integrated luminosity of 10 \({}^{5}\) pb\({}^{-1}\) and a lepton reconstruction efficiency of 90% (see Table 1).

Footnote 1: This corresponds to subprocesses 5 and 8 in PYTHIA.

The main features of the signal events are :

* A high-\(p_{T}\) lepton and neutrino, used to trigger the experiment;
* A high-\(p_{T}\) pair of nearby jets (\(\Delta R=\sqrt{\Delta\eta^{2}+\Delta\phi^{2}}\simeq 0.3\) on average due to the large W/Z boost), with an invariant mass peaking at the W/Z mass;
* Two forward/backward jets, corresponding to the outgoing quarks in the \(qq\to qq\,H\) process;
* No additional jet activity beyond the effects of initial and final state QCD radiation.

The transition between the central and forward/backward regions is more or less optimally defined around \(\eta=2\), and the forward/backward regions provide adequate coverage for the tag jets if they extend up to \(|\eta|\sim 5\), as shown in Figure 1.

### Backgrounds

The irreducible electroweak background from VV (V = W or Z) continuum production is much smaller than the reducible backgrounds, as described in detail in [1].

The reducible QCD background consists of W/Z + multijet production and, in the \(H\to WW\to l\nu jj\) case, also of \(t\overline{t}\to l\nu jjb\overline{b}\) production. The \(t\overline{t}\) background is potentially the most dangerous, since it contains two real W's. The additional b-jets which are present in the final state can be used to separate it from the signal.

This QCD background is dangerous due to its large cross-section. Two final-state jets can fake a W/Z decay if the invariant mass of the jet pair is close to \(m_{\,W/Z}\). Forward/backward jets are produced with, on average, a lower rate and \(p_{T}\) than for the signal. The Born-level W/Z cross sections have been conservatively increased by a K-factor of 1.5 to account for higher-order corrections to high-\(p_{T}\) W/Z+jets production [5]. This factor is close to the one derived from a recent study [6], yielding a factor 1.3 between the VECBOS prediction and the CDF data, plus an extra factor 1.3 (depending on \(p_{T}^{W}\)) between the PYTHIA and VECBOS predictions.

The W/Z+jet samples have been generated with \(p_{T}^{W/Z}\ >\ p_{T}^{u\bar{t}}\) where \(p_{T}^{u\bar{t}}\) was chosen such as not to bias the final sample after cuts (typically \(p_{T}^{cut}\ \sim\ 250\) GeV for \(m_{\,H}\ =\ 1000\) GeV). For the \(t\overline{t}\) background, there is no possibility to apply a direct threshold on \(p_{T}^{W/Z}\) at the generation level. Therefore, events were generated with \(p_{T}^{top}\ >\ p_{T}^{cut}\), where \(p_{T}^{cut}\) was chosen such as not to bias the final \(t\overline{t}\) sample (typically \(p_{T}^{cut}\ \sim\ 300\) GeV for \(m_{\,H}\ =\ 1000\) GeV).

Figure 1: _For \(qq\to qqH\) production with \(m_{\,H}=1000\) GeV, \(\eta\)-distribution of the outgoing quarks and reconstructed tag jets._Table 1 summarizes the rates for the signal and backgrounds before any cuts.

The three main issues studied in order to reconstruct the signal and reduce the backgrounds are :

1. Reconstruction with good efficiency and mass resolution of high-\(p_{T}\) W/Z bosons decaying to two nearby jets in the central region (\(|\eta_{jet}|<2\));
2. Reduction of reducible backgrounds using a jet veto cut in the central region (\(|\eta_{jet}|<2\)) with good efficiency for the signal, even in the presence of pile-up;
3. Efficient forward/backward jet tagging (\(2<|\eta_{jet}|<5\)).

## 3 Reconstruction in the central region

### Reconstruction of \(W/z\to jj\) decays

The ATLAS calorimeters were modelled by a grid in \(\eta\) and \(\phi\), with a granularity \(\Delta\eta\times\Delta\phi=0.1\times 0.1\). A particle entering a given cell deposits all its energy in this cell, and its energy is smeared according to \(50\%/\sqrt{E}+2\%\) for hadronic showers and \(10\%/\sqrt{E}+1\%\) for electromagnetic showers in the central region (\(|\eta|<3\)), while the energy is smeared according to \(100\%/\sqrt{E}+7\%\) in the forward calorimeters (\(3<|\eta|<5\)). To maintain high efficiency for the reconstruction of high-\(p_{T}\) W/Z bosons, the following reconstruction criteria have been used:

* First, at least one jet must be reconstructed by collecting all the cell energies with \(E_{T}^{cell}>E_{T}^{the\,hold}\) in a large cone \(\Delta R=\sqrt{\Delta\eta^{2}+\Delta\phi^{2}}=0.5\). This jet must satisfy \(p_{T}>p_{T}^{threshold}\) (chosen here as 350 GeV for \(W\to jj\) and 200 GeV for \(Z\to jj\)). The threshold of 350 GeV was optimized for the \(H\to WW\to l\nu jj\) channel, and was lowered for the \(H\to ZZ\to lljj\) channel in view of further studies, as discussed in particular Section 6;
* The mass of this jet, obtained by calculating the invariant mass of all the final particles in the jet, must be compatible with the W/Z mass;

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|} \hline  & \(\sigma.B\) & Events before & Events after & \(S/\sqrt{B}\) \\  & (pb) & cuts & cuts & \\ \hline \hline \(H\to WW\to l\nu jj\) & 0.017 & 1546 & \(364.5\pm 10.6\) & \\ \hline \(t\bar{t}\) & & & & \\ \(p_{T}\) (top) \(>\) 300 GeV & 21 & 561,481 & \(6517\pm 78\) & \\ \hline W + jet & & & & \\ \(p_{T}\) (W) \(>\) 250 GeV & 102.8 & 1,998,000 & \(9548\pm 126\) & \(2.9\pm 0.8\) \\ \hline \hline \(H\to ZZ\to lljj\) & 0.0027 & 210 & \(57.7\pm 1.6\) & \\ \hline Z + jet & & & & \\ \(p_{T}\) (Z) \(>\) 150 GeV & 250 & 1,205,396 & \(1575\pm 58.5\) & \(1.5\pm 0.07\) \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 1: \(H\to WW\to l\nu jj\) and \(H\to ZZ\to lljj\) signal and background rates, before and after cuts, in the central region (see text). The rates are computed for an integrated luminosity of 10\({}^{5}\) pb\({}^{-1}\) and a lepton reconstruction efficiency of 90%.

* Then two separate jets must be reconstructed in smaller cones of \(\Delta R=0.2\), within the big cone containing the first jet. The transverse energy of each of these jets must be larger than 50 GeV.
* Since the average separation between the jets from W/Z decay is rather small (\(\Delta R~{}\sim~{}0.3\)). a special feature is added to account for energy possibly shared between the two jets: if two jet candidates overlap, they are merged if one cluster shares more than a fraction \(f\) of its cells with the other. If not, they remain distinct and the cells common to both jets are assigned to the nearest jet.

Figure 2 shows the reconstructed \(p_{T}^{W}\), or \(p_{T}\) of the jet reconstructed in the big cone, for the \(W\to jj\) decays from the \(H\to WW\to l\nu jj\) signal (top) and the W+jet background (bottom), and for three values of \(f\).

The bottom plot shows that for \(f\) close to zero, a much larger number of W+jet events are accepted (potentially at low \(p_{T}^{W}\)) than for \(f\) close to unity. The best choice of \(f\) is the result of a compromise between the need to obtain a signal distribution for \(p_{T}^{W}\) with as small a bias as possible near the peak, and the desire to reduce as much as possible the W+jet background.

For this study, a value \(f~{}=~{}0.5\) was chosen, but it is clear that work with full simulation is needed to obtain a more realistic evaluation of the best method to treat overlapping jets.

### Central cuts

Table 2 lists the central cuts used for the selection of the \(H\to WW\to l\nu jj\) and \(H\to ZZ\to lljj\) signal events. These cuts are identical to the ones used in [1].

Table 3 (resp. 4) lists the efficiencies of the various central cuts, for the selection of the \(H\to WW\to l\nu jj\) (resp. \(H\to ZZ\to lljj\)) decays in the presence of pile-up, i.e. 40 minimum-bias events superimposed, whereas Table 5 shows the results at low luminosity for the case of \(H\to WW\to l\nu jj\) decays. The efficiencies for the backgrounds are also shown.

For the low-luminosity case, no \(E_{T}\)-threshold has been applied on the calorimeter cells, whereas a threshold of 3 GeV has been used for the high-luminosity case. The efficiency for reconstructing the \(W\to jj\) decays is 67% at high luminosity (see Table 3), resulting in an overall efficiency of 23.6%. The efficiency is slightly lower, 59.8%, for \(Z\to jj\) decays from \(H\to ZZ\to ljj\) (see Table 4), mostly due to the fact that \(p_{T}^{Z}\) is somewhat lower than \(p_{T}^{W}\). The overall efficiency is 27.5%, quite similar to the \(H\to WW\to l\nu jj\) case (the efficiency of the lepton cuts is higher in the \(H\to ZZ\to ljj\) case).

It should be noted that the efficiency for \(H\to WW\to l\nu jj\) without pile-up (see Table 5) is slightly lower than with pile-up, because a narrower window around the W mass (\(\pm 10\) GeV ) has been used.

Figure 2: _Reconstructed \(p_{T}(W)\) for \(W\to jj\) decays from the \(H\to WW\to l\nu jj\) signal (top) and from the W+jet background (bottom), for three values of the parameterf (see text)._

Table 1 summarizes the event yields for the signal and the backgrounds after the central cuts, for one year of operation at high luminosity, and for both the \(H\to WW\to l\nu jj\) and the \(H\to ZZ\to lljj\) channels. It can be seen that:

* The background to the \(H\to WW\to l\nu jj\) channel is dominated already by the W+jet background;
* The signal-to-noise ratios are still quite small, i.e. \(\sim 2\%\) for \(H\to WW\to l\nu jj\) and \(\sim 4\%\) for \(H\to ZZ\to lljj\);
* There is thus a clear need to improve both the signal-to-noise ratios and the significances.

### Jet Veto

It is clear that the central cuts alone are not enough to achieve an adequate sensitivity. To improve this situation, a jet veto in the central region can be applied, mainly to reject

\begin{tabular}{|l|r|r|r|} \hline Cuts & \(H\to WW\) & \(t\bar{t}\) & W+jets \\  & & (\(p_{T}^{top}\ >\ 300\) GeV ) & (\(p_{T}^{W}\ >\ 250\) GeV) \\ \hline \hline  & 5000 & 600,000 & 1,200,000 \\ \(W\to l\nu\) cuts & 2123 (42.5\%) & 41,566 (6.90\%) & 125,537 (10.5\%) \\ \hline \(p_{T}^{W\to jet}>\) 350 GeV & 1745 (82.2\%) & 25,338 (61.0\%) & 82,440 (65.7\%) \\ \hline \(m_{\,jet}\ =\ m_{\,W}\pm 15\) GeV & 1443 (82.7\%) & 8700 (34.3\%) & 9518 (11.5\%) \\ \hline \(W\to jj\) cuts & 1179 (81.7\%) & 6964 (80.1\%) & 5735 (60.3\%) \\ \hline \hline Overall efficiency & 1179 (23.6\%) & 6964 (1.20\%) & 5735 (0.48\%) \\ for central cuts & & & \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 3: _Numbers of generated events for the \(H\to WW\to l\nu jj\) signal and the dominant backgrounds before and after cuts in the central region in the presence of pile-up. The numbers in brackets represent the fraction of events surviving the cut under consideration._the \(t\overline{t}\) background in the case of \(H\to WW\to l\nu jj\) decays. Table 6 (resp. Table 7) shows the efficiency obtained for the signal and backgrounds without (resp. with) pile-up, as a function of the jet \(p_{T}\)-threshold.

These tables show, as expected, that the jet veto cut is much more efficient to reject \(t\overline{t}\) events than W+jet events. At low luminosity, \(p_{T}\)-thresholds as low as 15 GeV can be used, yielding a good efficiency for the signal (70%) and a rejection of about 30 against the \(t\overline{t}\) background. At high luminosity, this threshold has to be raised to \(\sim 40\) GeV to reach the same efficiency, yielding a reduced rejection against \(t\overline{t}\) of about 12. It should be stressed that the absolute value of the jet \(p_{T}\)-threshold is not very meaningful here, since a proper treatment of the pile-up, using in particular the bipolar shaping in the liquid argon electromagnetic calorimeter, has not been used [7].

Table 8 summarizes the improvements on the significances using a jet veto cut of 40 GeV. From this Table, it appears clearly that:

* There is a significant improvement for the \(H\to WW\to l\nu jj\) channel, both in signal-to-noise ratio and significance;
* The improvement is marginal for the \(H\to ZZ\to lljj\) channel, as expected;

\begin{table}

Table 5: _Numbers of generated events for the \(H\to WW\to l\nu jj\) signal and the dominant backgrounds before and after cuts in the central region without pile-up. The numbers in brackets represent the fraction of events surviving the cut under consideration._As discussed in Section 4, forward jet tagging is needed to improve further the visibility of the signal over the background. The jet veto and the forward jet tag are however correlated: for the signal, the overall jet veto efficiency on all signal events is around 70% with pile-up (see Table 7) for a \(p_{T}\)-threshold of 40 GeV. This efficiency increases to 90% for the tagged events, which is understandable when looking at the \(\eta\)-distribution of the tag jets shown in Figure 1. In the following:

* Both for the Higgs boson signal and the W+jet background, no factorization between the jet veto and the forward jet tagging has been assumed, i.e. the correlations have been taken into account.
* The factorization has been used only for the \(t\overline{t}\) background, owing to a lack of statistics. It appears that the factorization assumption on the \(t\overline{t}\) background yields slightly optimistic results, i.e. decreases too much the \(t\overline{t}\) background contribution. This effect is however not important, since the \(t\overline{t}\) background is not the dominant one after the central cuts.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|} \hline Jet veto efficiency (\%) & \(H\) & \(t\overline{t}\) & W+jets & Pile-up \\ \hline \hline Jet \(p_{T}\)-threshold (GeV) & & & & \\ \hline

\end{table}
Table 7: _Efficiency of the central jet veto on \(H\to WW\to l\nu jj\) signals and backgrounds in the presence of pile-up, as a function of the threshold on the jet \(p_{T}\)._Forward-jet tagging

To improve the signal significance, the only remaining feature of the signal events which could be used consists of the extra jets emitted in the forward region, i.e. \(2<|\eta|<5\), usually called tag jets.

### Definitions

Jets in the forward region are reconstructed using a standard cluster algorithm, where all cells above a given \(p_{T}\)-threshold are summed up in a cone \(\Delta R=0.5\), and only jets with \(p_{T}>15\) GeV are retained. For the signal process, one usually expects two tag jets, one in each of the forward and backward regions (see previous Section). One can require one or both of these jets to be reconstructed: candidate signal events can thus be single-tagged or double-tagged.

As discussed above, since the statistics available was not large enough at the time of the Technical Proposal, factorization was assumed between the central jet veto and the forward jet tagging, but only for the \(t\overline{t}\) background, for which the rejection coming from the jet veto is maximum.

### Efficiency

Table 9 shows the efficiency of requiring a double tag for the \(H\to WW\to l\nu jj\) signal and the backgrounds in the absence of pile-up, as a function of the tag jet energy cut. The double-tag probability is higher for \(t\overline{t}\) than for W+jet, since \(gg\) fusion can more easily produce extra jets which are labelled as tag jets. For a signal efficiency of \(\sim~{}20\%\) at low luminosity, rejections of \(\sim~{}100\) (resp. 250) can be achieved against the \(t\overline{t}\) (resp. W+jet) background.

The high-luminosity case was studied with care because of the risk of large jet-tag probabilities due to pile-up. Table 10 shows the probabilities of single or double jet tags from pile-up, as a function of the \(E_{T}\)-threshold on the forward calorimeter cells, \(E_{T}^{cut}\). It can be seen that the tag probability is very sensitive to the value of \(E_{T}^{cut}\): it decreases by a factor 10 per tag when increasing this threshold from 0.1 GeV to 3 GeV. This effect is partly due to the change in jet energy scale caused by the application of the cell threshold, but more

Table 11 (resp. 12) shows the single and double tag probabilities for \(E_{T}^{cut}=1\) GeV (resp. \(E_{T}^{cut}=3\) GeV) for the \(H\to WW\to l\nu jj\) signal and background events in the presence of pile-up.

At high luminosity, the double tag probability is \(\simeq 17\) % for the signal and \(\simeq 0.6\) % for the dominant W+jet background, for an \(E_{T}\)-threshold of 3 GeV per cell.

## 5 Signal and background yield for \(m_{H}=1\) TeV

This Section summarizes the expected signal and background rates and significances for the \(H\to WW\to l\nu jj\) and \(H\to ZZ\to ljj\) channels, for both low and high-luminosity operation.

### Low luminosity

The final \(H\to WW\to l\nu jj\) signal and background rates for the low-luminosity case are presented in Table 13 as a function of the threshold on the tag jet energy for events with double jet tags. Figure 3 shows the expected distributions for the reconstructed Higgs mass. These masses have been calculated for \(m_{H}=1000\) GeV and 800 GeV, assuming

The numbers in brackets represent the efficiencies of the jet tag cuts._that the neutrino momentum is known exactly (see Section 7.2). This assumption has a small effect on the overall mass resolution, since it is completely dominated by the natural width of the Higgs for \(m_{H}\geq\) 800 GeV.

After applying the central jet veto (with a threshold of 15 GeV) and requiring a double jet tag (\(E_{jet}>\) 600 GeV), one expects 19 signal events above a small background of 0.5 \(t\bar{t}\) and 1.9 W+jet, for an integrated luminosity of 3 \(\times\) 10 \({}^{4}\) pb\({}^{-1}\).

It should be emphasized that the apparently large statistical significances obtained even at low luminosity have to be taken with some caution. In addition to the low statistics expected, both the signal and the backgrounds mass distributions have the same shape, i.e. are very broad and peak at the same value because of the kinematical cuts (see Figure 3).

### High luminosity

The above conclusion holds also for the high luminosity case. Table 14 (resp. Table 15) shows the final signal and background rates, after applying the central jet veto, and requiring a single or double jet tag, for a cell \(E_{T}\)-threshold of 1 GeV (resp. 3 GeV).

Table 15, for the case \(E_{j}>\) 600 GeV, corresponds to the results presented in the Technical Proposal. This is also the case for the \(H\to ZZ\to ljjj\) channel (see Table 16). The final mass distributions both for \(H\to WW\to l\nu jj\) and \(H\to ZZ\to ljjj\) are shown in

Observation of signal mass peak

### Determination of background shape

The possibility to clearly observe a Higgs signal with \(m_{H}=1\) TeV above the background depends on two issues: the first one is the reconstruction of the Higgs mass peak itself (see Section 7.2), the second one is whether this broad mass peak can be observed above a not very well known background. To study this last issue, the cuts on the background were lowered at the generation level to: \(p_{T}^{top}>120\) GeV for \(t\bar{t}\) and \(p_{T}^{W}>100\) GeV for W+jet. The selection cuts on the signal and the backgrounds were then lowered, as shown in Table 17.

Table 18 (resp. 19) shows the signal and background rates and significances after applying the central jet veto and requiring a double tag, for the low (resp. high) luminosity case.

These Tables, if compared to Tables 13 and 15, display smaller statistical significances, due mostly to a substantial increase of the W+jet rate, but the increased background is not expected anymore to populate the same mass region as in Figures 3 and 4.

### Mass distributions

The final mass distributions, both for the \(H\to WW\to l\nu jj\) signal and the backgrounds, are displayed in Figure 5 (resp. Figure 6) for low (resp. high) luminosity, as a function of the energy threshold on the tag jets.

The situation is now radically different compared to Figures 3 and 4, for which the backgrounds were generated and analyzed with much higher \(p_{T}\)-thresholds. The signal and the background have a different shape and do not peak at the same mass. By varying the energy threshold on the tag jets, one can follow the evolution of the background, and a clear observation of the Higgs signal should be possible even at low luminosity.

In addition, a study of the side-bands around the \(W\to jj\) mass peak would certainly provide increased confidence in the understanding of the background shape since the dominant background arises from \(\mathrm{W}+\mathrm{jet}\) production, i.e. from events with a dijet mass distribution expected to be fairly flat over the mass region around \(m_{W}\) and \(m_{Z}\).

One can conclude that, even though the mass peak is very broad, the signal can be observed reliably above the background after a few years of operation at LHC for the following reasons:

* after all cuts, there is one dominant background, namely W+jet;
* the \(W\to jj\) side-bands can be used to control the background shape;
* varying \(E_{tag}^{threshold}\) provides a powerful tool to vary the signal-to-background ratio.

Search for Higgs bosons with lower masses

A search for Higgs bosons with lower mass in the \(H\to WW\to l\nu jj\) and \(H\to ZZ\to lljj\) channels is quite important, since it could provide an overlap with the \(H\to ZZ\to llll\) mode, which becomes rate-limited for \(m_{\,H}\geq 600\) GeV, and also with the \(H\to ZZ\to ll\nu\nu\) mode.

### Processes

For lower values of \(m_{\,H}\), the gluon-fusion process becomes much larger in cross-section than the vector boson fusion process \((qqH)\). The latter is better approximated by using the PYTHIA subprocesses 123 and 124 rather than 5 and 8 [8].

The cuts used in the central region are the same as the ones presented in the previous Sections.

Figures 7 and 8 represent, for three values of \(m_{\,H}\), the various kinematical quantities used for the selection. Figure 7 clearly shows that the lepton cuts and the \(p_{T}^{W}\) cuts have to be lowered when searching for Higgs bosons with lower masses. It also shows that the \(W\to jet\) reconstruction has to be re-optimized in this case, since the two jets from the W-decay are further apart, in particular by enlarging the jet cone \(\Delta R\). The default value \(\Delta R=0.4\) is clearly too small for \(m_{\,H}=600\) GeV, and therefore creates an artificial mass peak below \(m_{W}\) in the \(m_{\,jet}\) distribution.

Figure 8 shows that the tag jet properties are rather independent of the Higgs mass (\(\eta\), \(p_{T}\), minimum energy), allowing in particular to maintain a clean separation between the central and forward regions at \(|\eta|=2\).

### Higgs mass reconstruction

For \(m_{\,H}\geq 800\) GeV, the Higgs resonance is very broad and the method used to reconstruct \(m_{\,H}\) is therefore not very critical. For \(m_{\,H}=600\) GeV, \(\Gamma_{H}=113\) GeV [8], and one must take more care in the reconstruction of \(m_{\,H}\). The only difficult issue is to assess as well as possible the momentum of the escaping neutrino (this issue is of course only relevant for the \(H\to WW\to l\nu jj\) channel). Figure 9 shows the reconstructed \(m_{\,W\,jj}\) mass for various assumptions used in the reconstruction of the neutrino momentum. In all cases described below, one of the W-bosons is reconstructed using the information from the two jets in the final state.

**a)** assumes a perfect reconstruction of the \(W\to l\nu\). This estimate of \(m_{\,H}\) is kept as a reference for the other methods. The width of the mass peak therefore only reflects the accuracy of the \(W\to jj\) reconstruction;

**b)** shows the effect of estimating \(p_{T}^{\nu}\) from the overall \(E_{T}^{miss}\) obtained from the complete calorimeter (\(|\eta|<5\)), but still assumes that \(p_{L}^{\nu}\) is exactly known. In this case, the forward calorimeter is simulated with the same granularity and energy resolution as the rest of the calorimeter;

**c)** assumes that \(p_{T}^{\nu}\) is exactly known, in contrast to b). The only remaining unknown quantity, \(p_{L}^{\nu}\), is extracted by constraining the W mass, taken here on an event-by-event basis as given by PYTHIA. The two resulting solutions are both taken into account with a weight of 0.5. The large tails observed in the Figure correspond to the contribution of the wrong solution;

**d)** is as c) but uses a fixed value of \(m_{\,W}\) for the W mass constraint;

**e)** represents finally what it is possible to do experimentally, i.e. combines the effects of b) and d).

Figure 10 shows the additional contributions to the mass resolution from the forward calorimeter itself:

**a)** is equivalent to Fig. 9.e), i.e. it assumes that the forward calorimeter has the same performance as the central region;

**b)** assumes a realistic forward calorimeter, i.e. a granularity of \(0.2\times 0.2\) and a jet energy resolution of \(100\%/\sqrt{E}+7\%\);

**c)** uses the same assumptions as b), but shows in addition the contribution of the reconstructed \(W\to jj\) mass (the exact value of \(m_{H}\) Higgs is subtracted event by event);

**d)** shows finally the reconstructed Higgs-boson mass, including all experimental effects, as in c), and the Higgs-boson width (dashed line), whereas the solid line shows the distribution obtained by using the exact neutrino momentum and direction.

### Significances

#### 7.3.1 High luminosity

Table 21 summarizes for the three Higgs-boson masses before and after the central cuts, the expected signal rates and significances for the \(H\to WW\to l\nu jj\) channel and an integrated luminosity of 10 \({}^{5}\) pb\({}^{-1}\), and separately for the two Higgs-boson production processes, namely \(qq\,H\) and \(gg\) fusion. The efficiency of the cuts for the signal is \(\simeq 60\%\) for \(qq\,H\), whereas it is only \(\simeq 27\%\) for \(gg\). This large difference arises mostly from the lower efficiency of the central jet veto cut for the \(gg\) fusion process. Moreover the signal efficiency to the central cuts is higher for the \(qq\,H\) process, owing to the higher average transverse momentum of the Higgs boson (hence of its decay products) in this process.

The expected statistical significances are quite high for \(m_{\,H}=600\) GeV and \(m_{\,H}=800\) GeV, but the reconstructed mass distributions (see Figure 11) again demonstrate that, without careful optimization, it will be very difficult to observe the signal reliably above the background. This is mainly due to the fact that the signal-to-background ratio is very small (around 4%), and that the background shape itself cannot easily be evaluated to a comparable accuracy. For \(m_{\,H}=800\) GeV, the signal lies above a background which is not biased at low mass by the generation cut requiring \(p_{T}^{W}>150\) GeV. For \(m_{\,H}=600\) GeV, the generation cuts for the background clearly have to be lowered, in order to obtain an unbiased mass distribution in the region of the expected signal.

Because of the very low expected signal-to-background ratios for lower Higgs-boson masses, it appears necessary, as in the case of \(m_{\,H}=1000\) GeV, to require a double tag in the forward region: the corresponding signal rates and significances are shown in Table 22 as a function of the energy threshold on the tag jets. The improvement in the significances

On the other hand, as shown in Figure 13, the \(p_{T}\) thresholds applied to the reconstructed \(W\to l\nu\) and \(W\to jj\) decays are still too high to establish reliably the presence of a signal for \(m_{\,H}\) = 600 GeV.

Table 23 shows the same results as Table 22 for the \(H\to ZZ\to lljj\) channel and an integrated luminosity of 10 \({}^{5}\) pb\({}^{-1}\), showing that again after requiring a double tag, the signal can be observed in this channel for Higgs-boson masses as low as 800 GeV.

## 8 Optimized cuts for \(m_{H}=600\) GeV

As discussed above, for \(m_{H}=600\) GeV, special care is needed to demonstrate that the signal can be clearly observed above the background. One has to:

* lower the \(p_{T}^{W}\) threshold to 100 GeV to obtain an unbiased background shape;
* increase the cone size (\(\Delta R\)) used to reconstruct the \(W\to jj\) decay, since the W-boson is produced at significantly lower \(p_{T}\) than for \(m_{H}=1000\) GeV, which means that the decaying jets from the W-decay will be emitted further apart. Figure 15 shows the fraction of reconstructed events for the signal and the W+jet background, as a function of \(\Delta R\). A value of \(\Delta R=0.8\) was chosen for further study (such a large jet cone can only be used at low luminosity);

Figure 15: _For the \(H\to WW\to l\nu jj\) signal with \(m_{H}=600\) GeV, and for the W+jet background, fraction of events with \(m_{jet}=m_{W}\pm\) 15 GeV as a function of the cone size \(\Delta R\) used to collect the energy of the jets from the W-decay._* adjust the parameter \(f\) used in the jet-merging procedure (see Section 3.1). Figure 16 (resp. 17) shows the reconstructed \(p_{T}^{W}\) (resp. \(l\nu jj\) mass) for the Higgs signal and the W+jet background for different values of \(f\). The signal distributions clearly show that a choice of \(f\leq~{}0.5\) does not bias in any way the reconstruction (this is in fact the case even for \(f=0.1\)), whereas the background distributions show that for \(f=0.5\), the amount of background in the region of the signal peak does not increase beyond control as \(f\) increases.

Table 25 summarizes the efficiencies of the central cuts for the signal and the backgrounds (for this Higgs mass, the \(W\to jj\) cut has not been used). One can see that, owing to the optimized choice of cuts and reconstruction parameters, the efficiency for the signal has improved with respect to Section 7. Table 26 shows the dependence of the signal significance, after requiring a double tag, as a function of the energy threshold on the tag jets, for an integrated luminosity of 3 \(\times\) 10\({}^{4}\) pb\({}^{-1}\). Both the signal and the background

rates have increased considerably with respect to those shown in Table 24, to the extent that the significances have somewhat degraded. However, as shown in Figure 18, the signal shape (evaluated by using the complete reconstruction of \(m_{\nu jj}\), as in Figure 10), should now be clearly observable above the background, even after a few years of running at low luminosity.

Conclusions

The possibility to observe with ATLAS the production of a Higgs boson with \(m_{\,H}\sim 1\) TeV in the two decay modes \(H\to WW\to l\nu jj\) and \(H\to ZZ\to ljj\) has been investigated in detail at particle level. These modes are the only accessible ones for such a large value of \(m_{\,H}\). Using a dedicated \(W/Z\to jj\) reconstruction algorithm, central jet veto cuts and forward jet tagging, this note demonstrates that the Higgs-boson signal should be observed, after three years of operation at low luminosity, provided that the cuts are loose enough to clearly establish the presence of the signal above the background as a broad peak in the reconstructed mass \(m_{\,l\nu jj}\).

This conclusion holds also for lower Higgs masses (down to \(m_{\,H}\sim 600\) GeV), provided the cuts and the \(W\to jj\) reconstruction procedure are optimized even further. These channels will therefore provide a good overlap with the two competing purely leptonic decay modes, \(H\to ZZ\to llll\) and \(H\to ZZ\to ll\nu\nu\). For \(m_{\,H}\ \leq\ 600\) GeV, the gold-plated 4-lepton mode is clean and not rate-limited even at low luminosity.

The next steps in these encouraging studies are in progress [9] and are intended to evaluate with full simulation of the ATLAS detector:

* the quality of the \(W\to jj\) reconstruction, through a refinement of the jet algorithm used, a better optimization of the kinematical cuts, and a more realistic assessment of the \(W/Z\to jj\) and \(l\nu jj\) mass resolutions;
* the efficiency of the jet veto cuts as a function of luminosity;
* the reconstruction of the forward tag jets (both in the ATLAS end-caps and forward calorimeters), in term of its efficiency as a function of luminosity, as well as the impact of the calorimeter parameters on the Higgs mass reconstruction.
