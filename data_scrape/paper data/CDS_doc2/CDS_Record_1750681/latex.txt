###### Abstract

The ability to resolve and \(b\)-tag heavy flavor jets produced from the decay of boosted heavy particles, such as top quarks or Higgs bosons, is vital for the identification of new physics signatures as the LHC moves to higher energies and luminosities in 2015. Within these complex environments, resolving the different decay products can be achieved by using jets with a smaller distance parameter \(R\). We propose the use of small-\(R\) track jets for this purpose. Track jets allow for a flexible way to identify and tag \(b\)-hadron decays independently of calorimeter jet algorithms, thus providing a robust way to integrate \(b\)-tagging with non-regular jet algorithms (i.e. large-\(R\) groomed jets) optimized for boosted topologies.

Introduction

Many new physics models predict a resonance at the \(\mathrm{\TeV}\) scale that decays into highly boosted objects which may then further decay into hadronic final states. At very high boost, the hadronic showers can become close to a point where, using standard jet reconstruction algorithms, they begin to merge into a single jet, thus making it essential to resolve small distance scales. Over the last few years, ATLAS [1] has tested new techniques to search for these final states and to understand the underlying structure of jets. The focus has been on reconstructing the substructure of large-\(R\) jets (jet algorithm distance parameter \(R\geq 0.8\)), using calorimeter information, with various "jet grooming" algorithms employed to reduce the contamination from initial state radiation, the underlying event, and additional proton-proton interactions per bunch crossing or "pileup" [2, 3]. However, these new techniques have not yet been integrated with the track-based secondary vertexing and impact parameter tagging of heavy flavor quarks when \(b\)-quarks are present in the final state. Since many of these boosted processes contain \(b\)-quarks which subsequently form jets containing \(b\)-hadrons, or \(b\)-jets, it is vital to the success of these searches to integrate \(b\)-tagging with the new substructure techniques and be able to accurately reconstruct and identify the \(b\)-hadrons in these environments.

Track jets present an approach to integrate \(b\)-tagging methods with large-\(R\) groomed jet algorithms common to jet substructure techniques, where the calorimeter information may still be used to fully interpret the hadronic final state. They are formed by applying jet clustering on the tracks, in the inner detector, from charged particles originating from the hard scatter vertex.

There are several benefits of using track jets for finding \(b\)-hadrons. As \(b\)-tagging pattern recognition algorithms only use information from the inner detector, they can be decoupled from calorimeter jet finding in order to identify \(b\)-hadrons. The track jet algorithm can be optimized and calibrated specifically for \(b\)-tagging, independent of the calorimeter jet algorithm, which can be optimized separately to interpret the hadronic final state. Using the ghost-association technique [3, 4, 5], the \(b\)-tagging information provided by the track jets can be integrated with the calorimeter jet algorithm whilst taking full advantage of the calorimeter jet (and subjet) structure and shape.

Additionally, track jets are explicitly chosen to originate from the primary vertex, significantly reducing the performance dependence on pileup. This is especially important when reconstructing low \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\)\(b\)-hadrons that can be present in highly boosted states if the \(b\)-hadron is produced in the opposite direction to the boost of the decaying particle. These relatively low-\(p_{\mathrm{T}}\)\(b\)-hadrons might otherwise have been lost due to a higher \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\)-threshold imposed on calorimeter jets in order to reduce pileup.

Finally, the current ATLAS standard \(b\)-tagging algorithms look for \(b\)-hadrons locally around a seed direction defined by the jet axis. Track jets have good angular resolution with respect to the \(b\)-hadron, even in environments with dense hadronic activity where it is known that the \(b\)-tagging efficiency is reduced as the angular distance between the \(b\)-hadron and the axis of the jet increases [6]. This allows for the accurate determination of the seed direction for \(b\)-hadron identification within boosted topologies. Furthermore, track jets can easily take advantage of small \(R\) parameters, which ultimately lead to the best resolution and efficiency at the highest boost values.

Section 2 of this note describes the simulated samples used and the selection of physics objects for analysis, and provides descriptions of matching procedures and \(b\)-tagging algorithms. Section 3, describes the event selection and present the studies of the \(b\)-tagging performance in boosted di-Higgs topologies. Finally, a brief conclusion can be found in Section 4.

Simulation and Object Selection

### Simulation Samples

To motivate the use of track jets for \(b\)-tagging in boosted analyses, a benchmark model is considered consisting of a Randall-Sundrum graviton (\(RSG\)) decaying to a pair of Higgs bosons, where the boosted Higgs bosons further decay into collimated pairs of \(b\)-jets: \(RSG\to hh\to bb\ bb\ bb\)[7]. This process is modeled using the Randall-Sundrum framework with a warped extra dimension [8], which contains spin-2 Kaluza-Klein gravitons that decay to Higgs pairs with coupling \(c\equiv k/\bar{M}_{P}\). Here, \(k\) is the curvature parameter and \(\bar{M}_{P}\) is the Planck mass scale.

The \(RSG\) samples have been generated for 11 mass points from 1000 to 2400 \(\mathrm{Ge\kern-1.0ptV}^{1}\) with \(c=1\) using the implementation in References [9, 10]. The samples are produced using MadGraph 5[11] interfaced with Pythia8[12] with the AU2 tune [13], and CTEQ6 leading order (LO) [14] parton distribution functions (PDFs). To reproduce the pileup conditions in the data, extra minimum bias interactions generated with Pythia8[12] are superimposed on the simulated events. To simulate the detector response, the generated events are processed through a GEANT4 [15] simulation of the ATLAS detector, and then reconstructed and analyzed [16] in the same way as the data are.

Unless explicitly mentioned, the samples with masses between 1000 and 2400 \(\mathrm{Ge\kern-1.0ptV}\) have been combined to produce the distributions and efficiency curves in order to increase statistics. This set of samples produces a relatively uniform distribution of Higgs \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) in the range \(\sim 450-1200\) \(\mathrm{Ge\kern-1.0ptV}\).

### Object Selection, Association, and Flavor Labeling

**Calorimeter Jets:** The standard inputs to calorimeter jet reconstruction in ATLAS are topological clusters of calorimeter cell energy depositions [17], where only clusters with positive energy after noise correction are considered. The clusters are calibrated using the local cluster weight (LCW) method [18]. In this analysis, calorimeter jets reconstructed using FastJet[19, 20] with the anti-\(k_{t}\) algorithm [21] with distance parameter \(R\)=1.0 ("large-\(R\)" jets) are used, and their \(\eta\), energy, and mass are calibrated using a simulation-based calibration scheme, with in-situ corrections based on data [3]. The trimming algorithm [2], adopted by ATLAS as the standard grooming procedure for anti-\(k_{t}\) jets with \(R=1.0\) in Run 1, discards the softer components of the jet, including contributions from pile-up, and preferentially removes the underlying event. For trimming, \(k_{t}\) subjets with \(R=0.3\) and \(f_{\mathrm{cut}}=0.05\) are used.

**Track Jets:** Track jets are reconstructed from inner detector tracks2 using the anti-\(k_{t}\) algorithm with distance parameters of \(R\in\{0.4,0.3,0.2\}\). The tracks are required to have \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>0.5\)\(\mathrm{Ge\kern-1.0ptV}\), to have at least 1 hit in the pixel detector and 6 hits in the silicon strip detector, and to be tightly matched to the hard scatter vertex using impact parameter thresholds3 on the tracks. Such thresholds greatly reduce the number of tracks from pileup vertices whilst being highly efficient for tracks from the hard scatter vertex. Once the track jet axis is determined, a second step of track association is performed to select tracks with looser impact parameter requirements in order to collect the tracks needed for effectively running the \(b\)-tagging algorithms. Only track jets with at least two tracks, \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>7\)\(\mathrm{Ge\kern-1.0ptV}\) and \(|\eta|<2.5\) are used for the analysis.

Track jets with \(p_{\mathrm{T}}<7\) GeV are not used as this sample is dominated by light jets and the rejection of these jets by the \(b\)-tagging algorithms is low.

**Ghost-Association:** In events with a dense hadronic environment, there can often be an ambiguity when trying to match track jets to the calorimeter objects. The track jet association to large-\(R\) jets is performed using ghost-association [3, 4, 5], which provides a robust matching procedure that makes use of the catchment area of the jet [4]. As a result, matching to jets with irregular boundaries can be achieved in a less ambiguous way than a simple geometric (i.e. \(\Delta R\)) matching. In this procedure, the "ghosts" are the track jet 4-vectors in the event, with the track jet \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) set to an infinitesimal amount, essentially only retaining the direction of the track jets. This ensures that jet reconstruction is not altered by the ghosts when the calorimeter clusters plus ghosts are reclustered. The reclustering is then performed using the anti-\(k_{t}\) algorithm with \(R=1.0\). The calorimeter jets after reclustering are identical to the ungroomed parents of the trimmed jets used in this analysis, with the addition of the associated track jets retained as constituents. In the following text, track jets ghost-associated to the ungroomed jet refers to track jets found this way within the catchment area of the ungroomed parent jet, but the kinematics of the large-\(R\) jet are still measured using the trimmed jet. In addition, if trimming is subsequently performed on this reclustered jet, the track jets corresponding to the ghosts that survive the trimming procedure (and thus are clustered into one of the surviving subjets) are the track jets ghost-associated to the trimmed jet.

**Jet Flavor Labeling:** The labeling of the flavor of a jet in simulation is done by spatially matching the jet with generator level hadrons4: if a weakly decaying \(b\)-hadron (just before the decay in the simulation truth event record) is found within \(\Delta R<\min\{0.3,R\}\) of the jet direction, where \(R\) is the jet distance parameter, the closest jet (in the case of more than one match) is labeled as a \(b\) jet. If no \(b\) hadron is found, the procedure is repeated for weakly decaying \(c\)-hadrons. If no \(c\) hadron is found, the procedure is repeated for \(\tau\)-leptons. A jet for which no such association can be made is labeled as a light-flavor jet.

Footnote 4: This scheme is based on the ATLAS standard flavor labeling scheme which can be found in the \(b\)-tagging section of Reference [22].

### \(b\)-Tagging Algorithms and Working Points

Several algorithms to identify \(b\)-jets have been developed. They range from relatively simple algorithms based on impact parameter (IP3D) and secondary vertex (SV1) information to the more refined JetFitter algorithm, which exploits the topology of weak \(b\)- and \(c\)-hadron decays using a Kalman filter to search for a common line connecting the primary vertex to beauty and charm decay vertices. These algorithms have been documented in Reference [23].

The most discriminating variables resulting from these algorithms are combined in artificial neural networks, and output weight probability densities are evaluated separately for \(b\), \(c\), and light-flavor jets. The MV1 algorithm employs an artificial neural network based on IP3D, SV1 and JetFitter [24, 25]. It is trained with \(b\) jets as signal, and light-flavor jets as background. It should be noted that the multivariate \(b\)-tagging algorithms have been trained using calorimeter jets, but used for \(b\)-tagging for both calorimeter and track jets. This does not give the optimal performance for the track jets. Thus a dedicated re-training of the multivariate algorithms using track jets is expected to improve the track jet \(b\)-tagging performance.

The calibrations of the \(b\)-tagging algorithm are typically performed in the case when fixed thresholds are applied to the tag weights computed by the \(b\)-tagging algorithms. These fixed thresholds or _working points_ are generally tuned to obtain specified \(b\)-jet efficiencies in \(t\bar{t}\) samples. However, in this note the working point has been tuned to give a fixed \(b\)-jet efficiency in a sum of \(RSG\) samples with masses \(\in\{1000,2400\}\) GeV.

Performance of \(b\)-tagging in \(Rsg\to hh\to 4b\) Events

### Event Selection

To ensure that events contained a hard collision, at least one primary vertex with at least three tracks is required. In addition, events are required to pass one of several multi-jet triggers, as described in Reference [26], determined to be \(>99.5\%\) efficient for these samples.

In order to study the boosted di-Higgs final state, events are required to have two trimmed large-\(R\) calorimeter jets with \(|\eta|<2.0\) and \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>250\). Unless otherwise stated, when track jets are discussed in the following text, they are required to be ghost-associated to the ungroomed parent of a trimmed large-\(R\) jet, although the large-\(R\) jet properties will always refer to the trimmed large-\(R\) jet. Track jets are essentially pileup insensitive as they are selected to originate from the hard scatter vertex, and thus can find \(b\)-hadrons even in areas within the jet that have been trimmed away. When subjets are discussed in the following text, they are the subjets reconstructed using the \(k_{t}\) algorithm with distance parameter \(R=0.3\) retained from the trimming procedure.

### Boosted Kinematics

In general, the minimum angular separation of the 2-body decay products of a boosted heavy particle is approximately

\[\Delta R\approx\frac{2m}{p_{\mathrm{T}}}, \tag{1}\]

where \(\Delta R=\sqrt{(\Delta\eta)^{2}+(\Delta\phi)^{2}}\) between the two decay products, and \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) and \(m\) are the transverse momentum and the mass, respectively, of the boosted decaying particle. For a Higgs with \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\gtrsim 300\), the \(\Delta R\) between the decay products would be less than 0.8 (twice the standard ATLAS calorimeter jet distance parameter), suggesting that this is the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) threshold where the two \(R=0.4\)\(b\)-jets would begin to merge in the detector. Figure 1 shows the truth-level \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) spectrum of the leading and subleading Higgs bosons for two \(RSG\) masses, as well as the truth-level separation between the two \(b\)-quarks coming from the leading and subleading Higgs decay. At \(M_{RSG}\sim 1\), the leading \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) Higgs boson is almost always boosted above \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\gtrsim 300\) and the daughters of the Higgs boson are very often in the regime where the \(R=0.4\) jets resulting from the two \(b\)-hadrons would be merged. This ultimately suggests that the use of standard \(R=0.4\)\(b\)-tagged jets would result in a large loss of signal efficiency in an interesting \(RSG\) mass regime. ATLAS has searched for an RS graviton in the di-Higgs to \(4b\) final state [26] with \(R=0.4\) calorimeter \(b\)-tagged jets, where the sensitivity to new physics was reduced above \(M_{RSG}=1\) due to this merging effect.

One way to reduce this merging is to use small \(R\) subjets of large-\(R\) trimmed calorimeter jets for identifying \(b\)-hadrons. For instance, the ATLAS jet trimming procedure uses small \(R=0.3\)\(k_{t}\) subjets, but removes the subjets with \(p_{\mathrm{T}}<5\%\) of the original large-\(R\) jet \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) to mitigate the effects of pileup5. However, relatively low \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\)\(b\)-hadrons may still occur in highly boosted states if the \(b\)-hadron is produced in the opposite direction to the boost of the decaying particle. In a \(RSG\)\(M=1\) sample, roughly 8% of the Higgs bosons at the generator level have a \(b\)-quark with less than 5% of the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) of the Higgs. As will be shown later in this note, track jets can be used in harmony with the calorimeter jet to enhance the identification efficiency of low-\(p_{\mathrm{T}}\)\(b\)-hadrons while still using trimmed jets to identify boosted Higgs bosons.

Footnote 5: These trimming parameters have been optimized to minimize the large-\(R\) jet mass dependence on pileup [3]. Lowering the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) threshold on the subjets was found to dramatically increase the pileup dependence.

### Performance Studies

Distributions, normalized to unit integral, of the number of track jets of various distance parameters ghost-associated to the large-\(R\) jets, as well as the number of calorimeter subjets of the trimmed large-\(R\) jets, can be seen on the left plot of Figure 2. As the track jet radius decreases and finer features of the jet can be resolved, the number of track jets associated to the large-\(R\) jet increases.

As the \(b\)-tagging algorithms use tracks around the jet axis as inputs, the \(b\)-tagging performance

Figure 1: Truth level \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) spectrum (left) and truth level separation between \(b\)-quark decay products (right) for leading (solid line) and subleading (dashed line) Higgs in two \(RSG\) samples.

Figure 2: Distributions of the number of track jets ghost-associated to the large-\(R\) jets as well as the number of calorimeter subjets of the trimmed large-\(R\) jets (left). Distributions of the angular distance, \(\Delta R\), between track jets ghost-associated to the large-\(R\) jets / subjets of the trimmed large-\(R\) jets and the closest \(b\)-hadron (right). Track jets of various \(R\) parameters are shown. A sum of \(RSG\) samples with masses \(\in\{1000,2400\}\) GeV is used, with an equal contribution from each mass.

improves as the jet axis better estimates the \(b\)-hadron direction. The right plot of Figure 2 shows the \(\Delta R\) between various jet collections and the closest \(b\)-hadron. The smallest radius track jets have the largest peak at very small \(\Delta R\), and thus give the best estimate of the \(b\)-hadron direction.

Figure 3 shows the number of truth \(b\)-flavor labeled jets that are associated to the leading large-\(R\) calorimeter jet for various \(RSG\) masses, with no detector-level \(b\)-tagging applied. In the \(M_{RSG}=1.5\) TeV samples, only about 40% of the events have two \(b\)-labeled \(R=0.4\) track jets associated to the leading large-\(R\) jet, indicating that both \(b\)-hadrons are contained inside one \(R=0.4\) jet for a majority of the events. Decreasing the track jet distance parameter from \(R=0.4\) to \(R=0.3\) drastically increases the number of resolvable truth \(b\)-labeled jets to around 80%. Similarly, in the \(M_{RSG}=2.0\) TeV sample the effects of merging can be seen in both the \(R=0.4\) and \(R=0.3\) jets, while the \(R=0.2\) track jets are still able to resolve two truth \(b\)-labeled jets for around 80% of events.

The light-flavor jet rejection as a function of \(b\)-jet tagging efficiency for track jets ghost-associated to large-\(R\) jets and for calorimeter subjets is shown in Figure 4. The \(R=0.4\) track jets tend to have worse rejection at a given \(b\)-tagging efficiency as the radius is too large to resolve both close-by \(b\)-jets. Those merged jets tend to have a poor estimation of the \(b\)-hadron direction which leads to a degraded \(b\)-tagging performance relative to single \(b\)-jets [6]. The full \(b\)-hadron identification efficiency is shown in Figure 5. Here, it is defined as the fraction of \(b\)-hadrons that are matched both to the large-\(R\) jet and to a \(b\)-tagged calorimeter subjet or \(b\)-tagged ghost-associated track jet. The \(b\)-tagging is defined using the MV1 algorithm at a 70% \(b\)-tagging efficiency working point (derived separately for each set of jets, as described in Section 2.3). If two \(b\)-hadrons are matched to the same track jet or subjet, only the closest \(b\)-hadron is considered matched while the other is considered unmatched. The \(b\)-hadron identification efficiency essentially gives the overall acceptance times tagging efficiency for a given \(b\)-hadron. When the track jets are ghost-associated to a trimmed large-\(R\) jet (i.e. ghost-associated to the subjets of the trimmed jet), the performance is very similar for \(R=0.3\) track jets and the \(k_{t}\) subjets. However, because trimming effectively removes lower \(p_{\rm T}\) subjets, more \(R=0.3\)\(b\)-jets with \(b\)-hadron \(p_{T}<50\) GeV can be found when associating the track jets to the full ungroomed parent large-\(R\) jet.

Finally, putting together the ability to resolve close-by \(b\)-jets with smaller \(R\) parameters and the associated \(b\)-tagging performance, the gain in efficiency to find two \(b\)-tagged track jets / subjets in both large-\(R\) jets as a function of \(RSG\) mass points is shown in Figure 6. Here, the efficiency of \(b\)-tagging four jets is computed relative to events that have two large-\(R\) trimmed jets each with \(p_{\rm T}>200\) GeV. For the fixed 70% working point mentioned earlier, it can be seen that the 4-\(b\)-tag efficiency is much higher for smaller radius track jets. Additionally, the \(R=0.3\) track jets outperform the \(R=0.3\) calorimeter trimmed subjets because they are able to find lower \(p_{\rm T}\)\(b\)-hadrons coming from the Higgs boson decays.

Figure 3: Number of truth \(b\)-flavor labeled jets associated to the leading large-\(R\) calorimeter jets in an \(RSG\) sample with \(M_{RSG}=1\) TeV (left), \(M_{RSG}=1.5\) TeV (middle), and \(M_{RSG}=2.0\) TeV (right).

Figure 4: Light-flavor jet rejection versus \(b\)-jet tagging efficiency when using track jets with various \(R\) parameters ghost-associated to large-\(R\) jets, as well as when using the subjets of the large-\(R\) jet. These curves are computed per track jet / subjet. A sum of \(RSG\) samples with masses \(\in\{1000,2400\}\) GeV is used, with an equal contribution from each mass.

Figure 5: \(b\)-identification efficiency when using track jets with various \(R\) parameters ghost-associated to trimmed large-\(R\) jets (left) and their ungroomed parents (right), as well as when using the trimmed subjets of the large-\(R\) jet. The calorimeter subjets are the same in both figures. A sum of \(RSG\) samples with masses \(\in\{1000,2400\}\) GeV is used, with an equal contribution from each mass. Statistical uncertainties are included on the efficiencies but are negligible.

It can also be seen that the smaller \(R=0.2\) track jets are observed to perform better than the \(R=0.3\) jets in these environments.

## 4 Conclusions

The ability to resolve and tag heavy flavor jets produced in the decay of boosted heavy particles, such as top quarks or Higgs bosons, is vital for the identification of new physics signatures as the LHC moves to higher energies and luminosities in 2015. Within these complex environments, resolving \(b\)-hadrons can be achieved by using jets with a smaller distance parameter \(R\), where the decay products would have otherwise been merged. As track jets are independent of the calorimeter but can be matched to a variety of calorimeter jets with the use of ghost-association, they can provide flexible and robust \(b\)-tagging that can easily be integrated with calorimeter jet substructure techniques used to interpret the hadronic final state. In addition, track jets are sensitive to the low \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\)\(b\)-hadron phase space that is often lost by large-\(R\) calorimeter jet when grooming is applied. Finally, the smaller \(R\) parameter jets, such as \(R=0.2\) track jets, are observed to better resolve and \(b\)-tag the \(b\)-hadrons in boosted environments. Ultimately combining the track jet, subjet, and large-\(R\) jet information for boosted object identification will likely result in the best \(b\)-tagging performance in these topologies.
