The most probable value of a distribution represents the peak position of the respective probability density function.

## 1 Landau Distribution

Let us consider a minimum ionizing particle (mip) passing through a thin block of matter. Its energy loss distribution obeys the Landau probability density function (see [1])

\[{\cal L}(x)=\frac{1}{2\pi i}\int_{c-i\,\infty}^{c+i\,\infty}exp(\,s\ln s+xs)\, \mathrm{d}s,\qquad c>0 \tag{1}\]

The integral (1) is c-independent and describes the special Landau distribution with the maximum at \(x_{0}=-0.22278\) and a certain width [1]. Therefore, a general Landau distribution \(L\) depends on 3 parameters

\[L(x|p_{\,1},p_{\,2},p_{\,3})=p_{\,1}\times{\cal L}\Big{(}\frac{x-p_{\,2}}{0.58 60\times p_{\,3}}\Big{)} \tag{2}\]

where \(p_{\,1}\) is a normalization factor. The parameters \(p_{\,2}\) and \(p_{\,3}\) are connected with the most probable value1 (MOP) and the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the distribution by the relations

Footnote 1: The most probable value of a distribution represents the peak position of the respective probability density function.

\[\mathrm{MOP}(L) = p_{\,2}-0.13054\times p_{\,3} \tag{3a}\] \[\mathrm{FWHM}(L) = 2\sqrt{2\ln 2}\times p_{\,3}=2.355\times p_{\,3} \tag{3b}\]The multiplication factor \(0.5860\) has been chosen in the formula (2) in order to the Landau FWHM dependence (3b) fulfil the same relation as a Gaussian.

The formula (1) cannot be rewritten into an analytic form, but it can be piecewise approximated by exponential and rational functions. The comparison of the probability density function (1) and the analytic approximation is shown in Fig. 1.

## 2 Moyal Function

The Moyal function represents a simple analytic approximation of the detector response to a mip passage. The respective probability density function reads (see [3])

\[{\cal M}(\lambda) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}}\,exp\Big{(}-\,\frac{\lambda+\,exp(-\lambda )}{2}\Big{)} \tag{4a}\] \[\lambda = R\left(x-x_{p}\right) \tag{4b}\]

where \(x_{p}\) means the most probable value and \(R\) is a constant depending on the absorber [4]. We used this distribution in the general 3-parametric form

\[M(\,\lambda) = p_{1}\times exp\Big{(}-\,\frac{\lambda+\,exp(-\lambda)}{2}\Big{)} \tag{5a}\] \[\lambda = 2.22\times\frac{x-p_{2}}{p_{3}} \tag{5b}\]

Figure 1: The Landau distribution generated according to the function (1) using the standard CERNLIB subroutines [2]. The analytic approximation of the general Landau distribution (2) xandis.for fits the distribution.

The last parameter \(p_{3}\) is connected with the respective FWHM by the relation

\[\text{FWHM}(M\,)=1.6175\times p_{3} \tag{6}\]

## 3 The Detector Response

In the scintillator (the Tile calorimeter active medium ), the deposited energy is converted to the light signal. The light originated in the scintillator is absorbed in the wavelength shifting fibre, re-emitted at a larger wavelength and conducted to the photomultiplier. Finally, the photons reaching the photocathode interact with its material and liberate the electrons. Moreover, the final signal is influenced by the pedestal spread. All these effects are of statistical nature, therefore the original energy loss distribution will be smeared by a Gaussian due to the above fluctuations. These considerations result in the convolution formula

\[S_{i}=L_{i}\,\otimes\,G_{i} \tag{7}\]

where \(S_{i}\) represents the signal measured by the \(i\)-th scintillator after a mip passage and \(G_{i}\) stands for a Gaussian. The resulting function (7) depends on four parameters :

\[S_{i}(x|p_{1},p_{2},p_{3},p_{4}\,)=p_{1}\times\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\mathcal{ L}\Big{(}\frac{y-p_{2}}{0.5\,860\,\times p_{3}}\Big{)}\,\,exp\Big{(}-\,\frac{(x-y )^{2}}{2p_{4}^{2}}\Big{)}\text{d}y \tag{8}\]

The first three parameters correspond to the Landau distribution and the last one describes the Gaussian smearing.

For the muons passing through a material, the ionization losses dominate over a large range of incident energies. Therefore, a high energy muon deposits the main part of its energy in the detector as it were a mip.

The total Tile calorimeter response to a muon is given by the sum of signals coming from the scintillators along the particle's track and is proportional to the total track length in the active medium. Therefore, the total signal will be also smeared due to the sampling fraction fluctuations, which are caused by the particle entrance angle and impact point fluctuations. Taking into account the formula (7) for each scintillator, the total response \(S\) obeys the formula (8) as well, but with different parameter values. A more detailed description of the function properties is given in Appendix A.

### Comparison of the Moyal and Convolution Fits

The comparison of the Moyal (5a) and convolution (8) fits is shown in the Fig. 2. While the Moyal function fails to determine the correct MOP, the convolution function results in a good MOP prediction. The respective \(\chi^{2}/ndf\) improves as well. The results of the mentioned fits applied on the experimental data for several pseudorapidities are listed in Tab. 1.

If one applies the same procedure to the signal distribution of separate module 0 depths, the mentioned behaviour of both functions is still the same.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|c||c|c|c||c|c|c|} \hline \multirow{2}{*}{\(-\eta\)} & \multicolumn{3}{c||}{Moya1} & \multicolumn{3}{c|}{Convolution} \\ \cline{2-7}  & MOP & FWHM & \(\chi_{n}^{2}\) & MOP & FWHM & \(\chi_{n}^{2}\) \\ \hline
0.15 & 2.13 \(\pm\) 0.02 & 1.43 \(\pm\) 0.05 & 1.1 & 2.29 \(\pm\) 0.04 & 1.32 \(\pm\) 0.05 & 0.8 \\
0.25 & 2.40 \(\pm\) 0.02 & 1.42 \(\pm\) 0.05 & 1.1 & 2.57 \(\pm\) 0.05 & 1.33 \(\pm\) 0.06 & 1.1 \\
0.35 & 2.35 \(\pm\) 0.02 & 1.35 \(\pm\) 0.05 & 1.0 & 2.49 \(\pm\) 0.04 & 1.23 \(\pm\) 0.06 & 0.6 \\

0.65 & 2.66 \(\pm\) 0.03 & 1.73 \(\pm\) 0.06 & 1.4 & 2.88 \(\pm\) 0.04 & 1.64 \(\pm\) 0.06 & 0.8 \\

The muons escape the barrel calorimeter module on its side after passing the first two longitudinal samples.

\end{table}
Table 1: The results of the Moyal and convolution fits applied on the total TILECAL module 0 response to 100 GeV muons entering the calorimeter at different pseudorapidities \(\eta\). Both the MOP and FWHM are given in GeV, the listed errors are those obtained from the fit (Moya1), resp. calculated according to the formula (12). The columns \(\chi_{n}^{2}\) denote the respective \(\chi^{2}/ndf\).

### The Fit Parameters Properties

For the total TILECAL response, the Landau width parameter \(p_{3}\) is approximately constant over all pseudorapidities. This is illustrated on Fig. 3 - when keeping the \(p_{3}\) constant, the fit gives the same results as in the case of freely varying \(p_{3}\).

The parameter \(p_{4}\) (Gaussian sigma) slightly decreases with the increasing muon track length in the calorimeter.2 This feature reflects the fact that for larger muon track lengths the signal fluctuations become smaller.

Footnote 2: Sigma decreases with increasing value \(|\eta|\) in the range \(|\eta|\leq 0.7\). For higher values \(|\eta|\), the muon track length in the TILECAL barrel part decreases (geometry effect).

Figure 3: The convolution function fits with the fixed parameter \(p_{3}=0.29\) GeV (left column) and with \(p_{3}\) freely varying. The mentioned parameter is approximately constant over the whole pseudorapidity range for the TILECAL module 0 total response to muons.

Conclusion

The muon signal in TILECAL is rather poorly approximated with the Moyal function. It predicts the MOP value to be systematically lower than the convolution fit does.

The convolution function fits the experimental muon data better than the Moyal function over the whole range of studied pseudorapidities \(\eta\)\((-0.15,-0.25,\)\(-0.35,-0.45,-0.55,-0.65,-0.75)\).

A short description on how to fit a histogram with the convolution function is given in Appendix B.
