**A method for the construction of strongly reduced representations of ATLAS experimental uncertainties and the application thereof to the jet energy scale**

The ATLAS Collaboration

**Abstract**

A method is presented for the reduction of large sets of related uncertainty sources into strongly reduced representations which retain a suitable level of correlation information for use in many cases. So long as the search or measurement is not sensitive to the details of the correlations associated with the uncertainty source, this procedure can be used to reduce the complexity of the analysis. The method provides a self-consistent means of determining whether a given analysis is sensitive to the loss of correlation information arising from the reduction procedure. The method is applied to the ATLAS Jet Energy Scale (JES) uncertainty, demonstrating that the set of 67 independent sources can be strongly reduced to form a representation constructed of 3 nuisance parameters. By forming a set of four such representations, it is shown that JES correlation information is retained or probed over the full parameter space to within an average of 1%. This procedure is expected to significantly reduce the computational requirements placed upon early ATLAS searches in the upcoming 2015 dataset while still providing sufficient performance and correlation structure to avoid changing the analysis results.

_Update on September 28, 2016:_ _Figure 1 has been changed to show the uncertainties for anti-\(k_{t}\) jets built with a distance parameter R of 0.4 rather than 0.6, and using inputs of electromagnetic (EM) scale topoclusters rather than locally calibrated (LC) scale topoclusters. This change has been made to be consistent with the other figures in the document._

## 1 Introduction

Precision measurements of Standard Model (SM) observables require an extensive understanding of detector features and performance, particularly as they relate to the behaviour of physics objects. The ATLAS experiment has fulfilled this requirement through detailed studies into the performance of all relevant physics objects, including but not limited to electrons, jets, muons, and photons. As the understanding of a given object is improved, the associated level of uncertainty is reduced, and previously negligible systematic effects become relevant. This leads to an increase in the number of uncertainties associated to any given object, such as the Jet Energy Scale (JES), which comprises 67 independent sources in the 2012 dataset [1].

This increasingly detailed understanding of physics objects results in smaller uncertainties and an improved understanding of the correlations between different phase space regions, both of which are beneficial for precision measurements. However, not all analyses within ATLAS require this level of precision. In particular, searches for Beyond the Standard Model (BSM) physics are frequently insensitive to the fine details of correlations associated with experimental uncertainties. For such searches, the propagation of the full set of experimental uncertainties is thus a significant amount of effort for no discernible gain.

In order to reduce the burden for studies which are less sensitive to such effects, reduced experimental uncertainty scenarios have been derived through techniques such as eigenvector decompositions, as demonstrated in Ref. [2]. This procedure exchanges knowledge about the original source leading to each uncertainty component for a reduced set of uncertainty Nuisance Parameters (NPs), where these NPs are typically used by analyses in profile likelihood fits [3]. As an example, the JES is formed from a large number of independent measurements of detector, modelling, and other systematic uncertainties. With the original set, all features of the uncertainty can be attributed to a given measurement. After the eigenvector decomposition, the NPs are linear combinations of the set of sources, and thus observed features no longer correspond to a single given measurement. This procedure is able to reduce the 64 independent uncertainty sources related to the JES down to 17 NPs in the 2012 dataset with only percent-level changes in the correlations between jets [1].

The reduction of the number of parameters required to adequately represent experimental uncertainties has helped, but remains one of the factors limiting the amount of time required to conduct a search for BSM physics. With the upgrade of the LHC to a new energy frontier, it is critical to reduce the amount of computational time associated to both searches and measurements such that ATLAS can quickly investigate the existence of new phenomena across a wide selection of final states.

A common situation to consider is when analyses define kinematic regions of interest, typically called Signal Regions (SRs). It is common to then define additional mutually exclusive Control Regions (CRs), where the dominant SR backgrounds can be estimated using a data-driven normalization from comparisons to the observed data in the CRs. Once the dominant background processes have been normalized in CRs, an extrapolation over the kinematic variables which separate the SR(s) from CR(s) is performed, such as:

\[N_{\text{estimate}}^{\text{SR}}=N_{\text{data}}^{\text{CR}}\times\frac{N_{ \text{MC}}^{\text{SR}}}{N_{\text{MC}}^{\text{CR}}} \tag{1}\]

An important feature of this data-driven background estimation is that systematic uncertainties on the predicted background processes can be cancelled through the ratio of MC expectations. However, thiscancellation relies on the degree of similarity between the CR and the SR, which is quantified as the correlation strength. For example, if a given experimental systematic is taken as a single component, a 100% correlation is enforced. However, if this is split into multiple sub-components, different parameter space regions are decorrelated, possibly leading to different data-driven normalizations.

Experimental systematics within ATLAS are typically comprised of \(\mathcal{O}(10)\) NPs each, which can lead to a total of \(\mathcal{O}(100)\) NPs for moderately complicated analyses and much more for the most rigorous measurements. In order to study the impact of these many different systematic uncertainties, the entire analysis must be re-run with both upward and downward shifts of each variation, and the results must be stored for further use. This is a CPU-intensive process which requires substantial storage space, thus increasing the computational complexity of the analysis.

Statistical and theoretical limitations are often dominant for early analyses, and even moderately complex measurements typically depend on only a subset of the types of ATLAS experimental sytematics. In such cases, the dependence of the analysis on experimental uncertainty correlations is typically negligible. As such, the desire exists to reduce the number of NPs for each experimental uncertainty down to the minimum possible threshold. This threshold must be as low as possible, but still high enough that the change in the correlation structure does not introduce large artificial correlations such as in the above data-driven normalizations. The resulting sets of NPs which satisfy this criterion for a given experimental uncertainty are referred to as _strongly reduced representations_, also denoted \(\text{Rep}_{\text{str.red}}\).

It will be demonstrated that the JES in the 2012 dataset can be sufficiently represented with 3 NPs, thus significantly reducing the computational overhead associated with conducting searches for BSM physics, albeit at the cost of significant correlation losses. A method for determining whether a given analysis is sensitive to these correlation losses is also presented, which provides a robust means of determining when analyses can safely benefit from the use of strongly reduced representations.

## 2 Creating strongly reduced representations

The creation of a strongly reduced representation for a given experimental uncertainty consists of multiple steps. This procedure can be applied to various sources of experimental uncertainties, and will be explained generically in Section 2.1. An example of the application to the ATLAS JES uncertainties, described in Ref. [1], is provided in Section 2.2.

### Generic strongly reduced representations

There are two primary considerations when creating a strongly reduced representation. First off, the number of NPs used must ultimately be enough such that some representation of the underlying correlations can be constructed. For an observable with multiple bins, a single NP cannot do this, as by construction a single parameter is fully correlated with itself. The minimum possible number of NPs is thus strongly constrained by the number of kinematic regimes of interest. Experimental systematics typically depend on multiple variables, and thus it is difficult to determine the smallest possible number of parameters without running the procedure and observing the results as a function of each variable of interest. Only once this is done can the final number of NPs be decided upon, keeping in mind the balance of the need for a small number of parameters with the requirement of providing a suitable picture of the full set.

#### 2.1.1 Definitions and notation

Assume that the full representation \(\text{Rep}_{\text{full}}\) of a systematic uncertainty associated with the object \(\xi\) is comprised of \(N_{\text{full}}\) independent uncertainty sources. These uncertainty sources are then parametrized in terms of a collection of variables \(\{\chi\}\), which can depend on a combination of kinematics of the object such as \(p_{\text{T}}^{\xi}\) and other properties independent of the object such as the level of pileup activity1 present in the event. The corresponding correlation matrix \(\text{Corr}_{\text{full}}\) for two distinct objects \(\xi_{1}\) and \(\xi_{2}\) with the sets of variables \(\{\chi\}_{1}\) and \(\{\chi\}_{2}\) can then be constructed in the basis of these variables:

Footnote 1: Pileup activity in ATLAS refers to visible deposits throughout the detector which do not come from the hard scatter collision of interest. This may be from additional collisions within a given bunch crossing (in-time pileup) or from previous/subsequent collisions which occured within the read-out time of the relevant part of the ALTAS detector (out-of-time pileup).

\[\text{Corr }\left(\{\chi\}_{1},\{\chi\}_{2}\right) =\frac{\text{Cov }\left(\{\chi\}_{1},\{\chi\}_{2}\right)}{\sqrt{\text{Cov }\left(\{\chi\}_{1},\{\chi\}_{1}\right)\times\text{Cov }\left(\{\chi\}_{2},\{\chi\}_{2}\right)}} \tag{2}\] \[\text{Cov }\left(\{\chi\}_{1},\{\chi\}_{2}\right) =\sum_{i=0}^{N_{\text{full}}}\Gamma_{i}\left(\{\chi\}_{1}\right) \times\Gamma_{i}\left(\{\chi\}_{2}\right) \tag{3}\]

The systematic shift \(\Gamma\) associated with the source \(i\) and evaluated at the point \(\{\chi\}\) is denoted above as \(\Gamma_{i}\left(\{\chi\}\right)\). This same notation with different sub-scripts will be used for intermediary stages of the procedure and for the final result. For example, the strongly reduced representation \(\text{Rep}_{\text{str.red}}\) of the same systematic uncertainty associated with the object \(\xi\) is comprised of \(N_{\text{str.red}}\) NPs which in turn depends on the same set of variables \(\{\chi\}\). The same equation can then be used to construct the correlation matrix \(\text{Corr}_{\text{str.red}}\) for the objects \(\xi_{1}\) and \(\xi_{2}\) for any given representation.

By constructing the correlation matrices of the two representations and subtracting the reduced representation from the original set, \(\text{Corr}_{\text{full}}\,-\text{Corr}_{\text{str.red}}\), it is possible to quantify the level of agreement between a given simplified representation and the collection of NPs from which it was derived. Representing a set of functions with a subset thereof will almost always increase the level of correlations between NPs, with the exception of special cases discussed later. As such, this difference will typically be negative, signifying that correlation information is lost.

#### 2.1.2 Eigenvector decompositions and merging

Often a large number of the uncertainty sources depend on the same parameter(s). If \(N_{\text{full}}^{\chi}\) components depend solely on a subset of \(\{\chi\}\), referred to as \(\chi\), and if \(N_{\text{full}}^{\chi}\) is a substantial fraction of \(N_{\text{full}}\), then this provides a means of simplifying the set of uncertainty components. Constructing the covariance matrix of the subset \(N_{\text{full}}^{\chi}\) in the basis \(\chi\) following Equation 3 and then diagonalizing the matrix provides direct access to the eigenvectors. These eigenvectors are now linear combinations of the underlying independent uncertainty sources, referred to as NPs, and each eigenvector no longer has a direct physical meaning.

In order to reduce the number of parameters, the dominant eigenvectors can be retained as independent NPs while the sub-dominant terms are merged. The simplest and often sufficient scheme for merging the sub-dominant parameters is to combine them in quadrature to form a _residual term_, as done in Ref. [2]. In this scheme, by retaining only the dominant \(N-1\) eigenvectors, the set of \(N_{\text{full}}^{\chi}\) uncertainty sourcesis reduced to \(N\) independent NPs. In some cases, this specific merging procedure is sub-optimal, and different methods are preferred. One case where such a simple merging is not sufficient will be discussed later.

In the scenario where the experimental systematic has sources which depend on variables other than \(\chi\), it is generally still a good idea to retain the dominant \(N_{\text{str.red}}^{\chi}-1\) eigenvectors and combine the rest into a residual term. A larger number of parameters typically makes the following quadrature combination step more difficult for little gain, while a smaller number of NPs usually makes the correlation representation significantly worse. Under this decomposition and merging scheme, the total set of \(N_{\text{full}}\) parameters is reduced to \(N_{\text{evdm}}=N_{\text{full}}-N_{\text{full}}^{\chi}+N_{\text{str.red}}^{\chi}\) NPs, forming the \(\text{Rep}_{\text{evdm}}\) representation.

#### 2.1.3 Quadrature combinations

Once the eigenvector decomposition and the subsequent merging of sub-dominant eigenvectors has been performed, there remains \(N_{\text{evdm}}\) parameters. For some systematics where the sources all depend on the same variables, this may be sufficient, and the decomposition procedure has already determined the most relevant terms. However, in most cases, \(N_{\text{evdm}}\) will still be a number which is reasonably large compared to the desired final set of \(N_{\text{str.red}}\) parameters, and thus some additional combinations must be performed. If the experimental systematic contains NPs which depend on differing parameters, then a pre-determined ranking of the NPs by relevance is non-trivial to construct, and the simple merging performed after the eigenvector decomposition procedure is not useful.

In order to obtain a strongly reduced representation in such scenarios, there remains \(\binom{N_{\text{evdm}}}{N_{\text{str.red}}}\) possible combinations to investigate. This is usually a large number, and thus it is desirable to reduce the representation as much as possible through the eigenvector decomposition procedure, so long as the option exists. Knowledge of the underlying uncertainty distributions must be applied in order to derive a reasonable strongly reduced representation. Even when using such knowledge, it is difficult to adequately represent the entire parameter space defined by \(\{\chi\}\). Significant correlation losses in some regions are still expected and observed, as shown in Section 2.2.

One useful strategy for the quadrature combination step is to start by allocating one NP to represent each regime of interest. For example, if the uncertainties depend primarily on variables \(\chi_{1}\) and \(\chi_{2}\), and if both variables have a _small_ and _large_ value regime, then this would support the use of four NPs. Components which are dominant for small \(\chi_{1}\) and large \(\chi_{2}\) would all be summed in quadrature, and a similar reduction would be performed for the other regime combinations, thus grouping similar parameter space dependencies. This reduces the magnitude of the correlation losses and minimizes (but does not forbid) the creation of new artificial correlation structures between vastly different regions of the parameter space. Note that similar to forming the residual term, combining components in quadrature discards correlation information within a given NP, thus any component which represents an anti-correlation between different regions of parameter space must be treated with care.

While this is one strategy, it will not necessarily be the optimum arrangement for every experimental systematic. For example, some of the parameters may be interdependent, and thus forming a region for each possible combination of \(\chi_{1}\) and \(\chi_{2}\) may be more than is needed. In such situations, additional knowledge of the structure of the uncertainty dependencies can be used to further reduce the number of NPs. This will be demonstrated in Section 2.2.

Regardless of which exact quadrature combination was performed, there are now only \(N_{\text{str.red}}\) remaining NPs, and thus the experimental systematic in question has been reformed into a strongly reduced representation. It remains to confirm that \(\text{Corr}_{\text{str.red}}\) provides a suitable representation of \(\text{Corr}_{\text{full}}\).

### Strongly reduced representations of the ATLAS JES uncertainties

This document focuses on the use of jets reconstructed by ATLAS using the anti-\(\text{k}_{t}\) algorithm [4] with a distance parameter of \(R=0.4\) and calibrated using the EM+JES prescription as described in Ref. [1]. The associated JES uncertainties are constructed from \(N_{\text{full}}^{\text{JES}}=67\) independent sources [1]:

* 56 components come from _in situ_ balance techniques covering low, medium, and high-\(p_{\text{T}}^{\text{jet}}\) regimes and depend solely on \(p_{\text{T}}^{\text{jet}}\)
* 2 components come from _in situ_ dijet \(\eta\)-intercalibration methods and depend on both \(p_{\text{T}}^{\text{jet}}\) and \(\eta^{\text{jet}}\)
* 1 component comes from single-hadron response measurements in the very high \(p_{\text{T}}^{\text{jet}}\) regime and depends solely on \(p_{\text{T}}^{\text{jet}}\)
* 4 components come from pileup sensitivity and depend on a combination of \(p_{\text{T}}^{\text{jet}}\), \(\eta^{\text{jet}}\), \(N_{\text{PV}}\), and \(\langle\mu\rangle\)
* 3 components cover flavour uncertainties and depend on \(p_{\text{T}}^{\text{jet}}\), \(\eta^{\text{jet}}\), and the flavour composition being investigated
* 1 component applies to jets which are not fully contained in the calorimeters (punch-through), and depends on \(p_{\text{T}}^{\text{jet}}\), \(\eta^{\text{jet}}\), and the number of segments in the muon detectors aligned with the jet

Summary plots of the JES constructed from the full set of uncertainty sources evaluated for variable \(p_{\text{T}}^{\text{jet}}\) with \(\eta^{\text{jet}}=0\) or variable \(\eta^{\text{jet}}\) with \(p_{\text{T}}^{\text{jet}}=60\text{\leavevmode\nobreak\ GeV}\) are provided in Figure 1, demonstrating the shapes of each group of components. The correlation matrix \(\text{Corr}_{\text{full}}^{\text{JES}}\) is shown for the same fixed values in Figure 2, depicting the nominal correlation structure of the JES.

#### 2.2.1 Eigenvector decompositions and merging

The ATLAS Collaboration has a history of applying the eigenvector decomposition procedure, where the dominant eigenvectors are retained and the sub-dominant eigenvectors are merged, to the JES _in situ_ balance components. In this scenario, the set of \(N_{\text{full}}^{p_{\text{T}}^{\text{jet}},\text{JES}}=56\) can be reduced to 6 NPs with only percent-level losses of correlation information, resulting in a representation with 17 NPs [2]. However, this is still too many parameters, and thus the JES strongly reduced representation \(\text{Rep}_{\text{str.red}}^{\text{JES}}\) with only \(N_{\text{str.red}}^{\text{JES}}=3\) was constructed. The eigenvector decomposition and merging procedure was tightened to retain only the dominant two eigenvectors, while the remaining eigenvectors were summed in quadrature to form a residual term, thus producing an intermediate representation of \(N_{\text{evdm}}^{\text{JES}}=14\) NPs.

This stronger merging of the sub-dominant eigenvectors results in larger correlation losses, as seen in Figure 3. Correlation losses between \(\text{Rep}_{\text{full}}^{p_{\text{T}}^{\text{jet}},\text{JES}}\) and \(\text{Rep}_{\text{evdm}}^{p_{\text{T}}^{\text{jet}},\text{JES}}\) are seen to have a maximum (mean) of 28% (8.7%), while losses between the \(\text{Rep}_{\text{full}}^{\text{JES}}\) and \(\text{Rep}_{\text{evdm}}^{\text{JES}}\) representations are 18% (3.9%). The correlation losses between \(\text{Rep}_{\text{full}}^{\text{JES}}\) and \(\text{Rep}_{\text{evdm}}^{\text{JES}}\) are smaller than the difference between \(\text{Rep}_{\text{full}}^{p_{\text{T}}^{\text{jet}},\text{JES}}\) and Figure 1: The full set of 67 JES uncertainty sources, grouped by the general type of the component, as a function of \(p_{\rm T}^{\rm jet}\) for \(\eta^{\rm jet}=0\) (left) and as a function of \(\eta^{\rm jet}\) for \(p_{\rm T}^{\rm jet}=60\) GeV (right). The 56 _in situ_ balance uncertainties and the single-hadron response uncertainty all fix the absolute scale of jets in the central region, and thus are grouped into the _Absolute in situ JES_. The two _in situ_\(\eta\)-intercalibration uncertainties which fix the scale of forward jets with respect to central jets are referred to as the _Relative in situ JES_. The flavour composition and response uncertainties are shown as separate components, while the \(b\)-jet scale uncertainty is excluded (as the total uncertainty is either the two general flavour terms or the single \(b\)-jet term, depending on the jet type). The four pileup uncertainties are grouped together, while the punch-through uncertainty is shown separately.

Figure 2: The JES correlation matrix built from the full set of 67 uncertainty sources, \(\rm{Corr}_{full}^{\rm{IES}}\), as a function of \(p_{\rm T}^{\rm jet1}\) and \(p_{\rm T}^{\rm jet2}\) for \(\eta^{\rm jet1}=\eta^{\rm jet2}=0\) (left) and as a function of \(|\eta^{\rm jet1}|\) and \(|\eta^{\rm jet2}|\) for \(p_{\rm T}^{\rm jet1}=p_{\rm T}^{\rm jet2}=60\) GeV (right). The correlation regimes of low, medium, and high \(p_{\rm T}^{\rm jet}\) for the different _in situ_ balance techniques and the very high \(p_{\rm T}^{\rm jet}\) regime from the single-hadron response are visible, as is the visible correlation regimes of central and forward jets in \(|\eta^{\rm jet1}|\) from the _in situ_\(\eta\)-intercalibration technique.

\(\mathrm{Rep}_{\mathrm{e}\mathrm{v}\mathrm{d}m}^{\mathrm{jet}\mathrm{JES}}\) because several of the NPs which were not included in the reduction are large, thus smearing out the correlation losses occuring from the reduction of the _in situ_ balance NPs.

In Figure 3, the observed structure is due to the presence of three \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{jet}}\) regimes. The _in situ_ balance consists of a \(Z+\)jet balance, \(\gamma+\)jet balance, and multi-jet balance which correspond to low, medium, and high \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{jet}}\) regimes. The three largest eigenvectors arising from the eigenvector decomposition procedure represent these three regimes, but the choice of \(N_{\mathrm{str.red}}^{\mathrm{JES}}\) of 3 with the simple merging scheme means that only the dominant two eigenvectors are retained while the remaining terms are combined in quadrature to form the third NP. Given that the JES uncertainty typically reduces with \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{jet}}\), this means that the low and medium \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{jet}}\) regimes have the largest eigenvalues, and thus are retained, leaving the largest high \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{jet}}\) eigenvector to be combined with all of the sub-dominant eigenvectors. This combination adds correlations between the high and low/medium \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{jet}}\) regimes, causing the observed correlation losses. So long as this specific value of \(N_{\mathrm{str.red}}^{\mathrm{JES}}\) is required when performing the eigenvector decomposition and subsequent sub-dominant merging to a residual term, this presents a lower bound on the amount of lost correlation information, as further combinations of components will only exacerbate the loss. A means of evading this boundary will be discussed in Section 3.1.

#### 2.2.2 Quadrature combinations

For the JES, there are still 14 NPs, thus there are \(\binom{14}{3}=364\) combinations to consider. Knowledge of the underlying correlation structure must be exploited in order to determine suitable combinations for use as strongly reduced representations. Even after using this knowledge and grouping the components into 3 final NPs based roughly on the kinematic regime in which they are the most relevant (low, medium, or high \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{jet}}\)), considerable correlation losses are observed, as shown in Figure 4. For two jets at \(|\eta^{\mathrm{jet}}|=0\), the maximum (mean) \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{jet}}\) correlation loss between \(\mathrm{Rep}_{\mathrm{full}}^{\mathrm{JES}}\) and \(\mathrm{Rep}_{\mathrm{str.red}}^{\mathrm{JES}}\) is 33% (10%), while for two jets at \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{jet}}=60\) GeV, the maximum (mean) \(|\eta^{\mathrm{jet}}|\) correlation loss is 8% (3%).

In practice, the full correlation structure is much more complicated than those shown in Figure 4. Instead, the correlations depend on all variables of interest which enter into the uncertainty parametrization. For the JES, the primary dependencies are with respect to the transverse momentum and pseudorapidity of the jet. However, there are also dependencies on the amount of in-time and out-of-time pileup, the flavour composition of the sample (how many jets are initiated by light quarks, gluons, or other partons), and whether or not the jet is fully contained in the calorimeter. Many analyses choose to conservatively assume their flavour structure is 50% gluons with a 50% uncertainty, and thus this assumption was retained, rendering the flavour composition dependency negligible. Jets which escape the calorimeters remain rare at the energy scale considered, and thus also provide sub-dominant effects. The dependencies on pileup are not so simple, and are discussed in more detail in Section 3.3, but will be ignored for now as they are less relevant.

While studying the correlation loss as a function of a given variable with other dependencies held at a fixed value is one possible approach, the largest losses of correlation information are expected in regions where multiple dependencies are varied simultaneously. For the JES, the four primary dependencies are \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{jet1}}\), \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{jet2}}\), \(|\eta^{\mathrm{jet1}}|\), and \(|\eta^{\mathrm{jet2}}|\), thus the largest expected correlation losses should occur when comparing low \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{jet}}\) central jets to high \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{jet}}\) forward jets or high \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{jet}}\) central jets to low \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{jet}}\) forward jets. Figure 5 demonstrates that this expectation matches what is observed, with correlation losses of up to 83%.

## 3 Multiple representations

The large observed differences in correlations between \(\mathrm{Rep_{full}}\) and \(\mathrm{Rep_{str.red}}\), if left unchecked, render such a simplified representation unusable. If an analysis was to use such a strongly reduced representation, any estimate which depends on correlations would be significantly affected. In order to further progress, it is necessary to probe the correlation sensitivity of each analysis. This can be done by repeating the full procedure defined in Section 2.1 with different assumptions, thus combining components in a way such that different kinematic regions become better or worse representations of the full matrix. In the ideal case, it is then possible to bracket the correlation matrix \(\mathrm{Corr_{full}}\) with multiple strongly reduced Figure 5: The three parameters which form the first JES strongly reduced representation \(\text{Rep}^{\text{JES,1}}_{\text{str.red}}\) as a function of \(p_{\text{T}}^{\text{jet}}\) (top left) and \(\eta^{\text{jet}}\) (top right), and the correlation loss observed after applying the full reduction procedure to the JES uncertainties with \(N_{\text{full}}^{\text{JES}}=67\) and \(N_{\text{str.red}}^{\text{JES}}=3\) (bottom). The difference \(\text{Corr}^{\text{JES}}_{\text{full}}-\text{Corr}^{\text{JES}}_{\text{str.red}}\) is shown for variable \(p_{\text{T}}^{\text{jet}}\) within each sub-plot, where each sub-plot corresponds to evaluating the correlation function for a given value of \(|\eta^{\text{jet}}|\) and \(|\eta^{\text{jet}}|^{2}\) denoted on the axes. White regions represent parameter space beyond the kinematic limit for \(\sqrt{s}=8\text{\ Te\kern-1.0ptV}\). Each sub-plot is evaluated at 100 logarithmically distributed \(p_{\text{T}}^{\text{jet}}\) values per axis, ranging from 15 to 2.5\(\text{\ Te\kern-1.0ptV}\). The top (bottom) number in each sub-plot is the maximum (mean) observed correlation difference, where the mean excludes the kinematically forbidden region.

representations of \(N_{\text{str.red}}\) parameters each. In such a scenario, a set of strongly reduced representations \(\{\text{Rep}_{\text{str.red}}\}\) is formed.

If the full correlation matrix can be bracketed, then an analysis can test all of the strongly reduced representations once, and propagate the NPs of each \(\text{Rep}_{\text{str.red}}\) through the analysis until the final observable is determined. If the different representations all provide equivalent results, then the analysis is not sensitive to correlation changes arising from the reduction procedure when applied to the experimental uncertainty in question. In such a case, the analysis can use any of the strongly reduced representations for all further studies and be certain that their ignorance of the true correlation structure is not changing the results. Alternatively, if the analysis does observe differences in the final observable when using different strongly reduced representations, then they are sensitive to the correlations arising from that experimental uncertainty, and cannot safely use this approach.

In reality, it is often not possible to bracket the full correlation matrix. By combining components, the level of correlations is only ever increased. Alternative methods can sometimes be exploited to avoid this boundary, such as those described in Section 3.1, but these other methods are also limited in scope. Ultimately, there will be parameter space regions where the full correlation matrix is not bracketed by the set of strongly reduced representations \(\{\text{Rep}_{\text{str.red}}\}\). Instead, a means of determining the performance of a given set of strongly reduced representations must be defined as in Section 3.2 such that the amount of the parameter space where correlations are not properly accounted for can be quantified.

### Useful techniques for developing a set of strongly reduced representations

When working with a single strongly reduced representation, generally the best approach is to simply proceed as described in Section 2 and to loosen the restriction on \(N_{\text{str.red}}\) if problems are encountered. However, when working with multiple strongly reduced representations, it is often useful to slightly change the rules associated with the procedure. These modifications typically result in reduced correlation losses in some regions of the parameter space, but at the cost of significantly increased correlation losses in other areas, thus they are only useful when working with a set rather than a single representation. The first method described below can even be used to occasionally weaken the correlations in the \(N_{\text{str.red}}\) representation with respect to the full \(N_{\text{full}}\) picture, which can be a very useful feature. All three of these techniques were used in forming the \(\{\text{Rep}_{\text{str.red}}^{\text{JES}}\}\) shown in Section 3.3.

#### 3.1.1 Two-point systematics

While most of the systematic sources in a given experimental uncertainty relate to direct observables with a well understood correlation structure, there are exceptions. Sometimes, due to lack of other suitable options, the difference between two different simulated samples is taken as an uncertainty. This is known as a two-point systematic, and in such cases it is assumed that the true value of the observable lies within the range. If another pair (or more) of simulated samples was used, a different uncertainty would be obtained, and thus the assumption that the nominal value lies within the range is crucial. For two-point systematics, the correlation structure is ill defined, and treating it as a single component is only one possible alternative. One method to roughly address this is to split the systematic into two identical components convoluted with complementary weights, thus adding up to be equivalent to the original uncertainty. The first component is an arbitrary function \(f_{1}\) with a weight between 0 and 1, such as a linear increase from 0 to 1 across \(|\eta|\) or \(\log p_{\text{T}}\) ranges, while the second component is the quadratic complement \(f_{2}=\sqrt{1-f_{1}^{2}}\). Figure 6 provides an example of the application of such weights to split a single two-point systematic derived from the difference between two simulated samples used for the JES \(\eta\)-intercalibration procedure. This split weakens the magnitude of correlation (adds correlation information), thus if the two sub-components are retained in separate component groups, then \(\mathrm{Rep}_{\mathrm{str.red}}\) can have more correlation information than \(\mathrm{Rep}_{\mathrm{full}}\) in certain regions.

#### 3.1.2 NP with large anti-correlations

A different technique can be applied to NPs which carry an anti-correlation across some kinematic range. For example, a single NP from the eigenvector decomposition procedure may have a positive uncertainty at low \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) and a negative uncertainty at high \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\), as was observed in the construction of the JES uncertainties in Ref. [1]. The actual global sign of the uncertainty in this case is arbitrary, as it is demonstrating the anti-correlation of the low and high \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) regimes. In such a case, combining this component in quadrature with any other uncertainty will discard this information, as a quadrature sum takes the absolute value of the uncertainty. This means that if the component has a non-negligible uncertainty magnitude, it is worth having one strongly reduced representation where the NP is not combined with any others, thus preserving the kinematic anti-correlation information.

#### 3.1.3 Splitting the residual term

One other option for changing the correlation structure of \(\mathrm{Rep}_{\mathrm{str.red}}\) is to slightly weaken the eigenvector decomposition. In some cases, the \(N^{\mathrm{th}}\) eigenvector may be larger than the \((N+1)^{\mathrm{th}}\), but the \((N+1)^{\mathrm{th}}\) may be more important in a given kinematic region. To avoid combining this important \((N+1)^{\mathrm{th}}\) eigenvector

Figure 6: A demonstration of the two-point systematic splitting procedure, where the functional part \(f_{1}\) is performed across \(\log p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{jet}}\) as a function of \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{jet}}\) at \(|\eta^{\mathrm{jet}}|=4\) (left) or across \(|\eta^{\mathrm{jet}}|\) as a function of \(\eta^{\mathrm{jet}}\) at \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{jet}}=60\) GeV (right). The value of \(|\eta^{\mathrm{jet}}|=4\) in the left plot is chosen for demonstrative simplicity, not because this point is particularly important. The functional part \(f_{1}\) applies a linear weight starting at 0 and ending at 1, as can be seen in the left plot. The complementary part \(f_{2}\) is then \(\sqrt{1-f_{1}^{2}}\) in order to preserve the total uncertainty, as is also clearly visible on the left plot. The filled region is the uncertainty obtained if the two-point systematic is left as a single NP, while the solid red line is the quadratic sum of the two split components, providing a sanity check that the total uncertainty is always left constant. The right plot demonstrates the same effects as a function of \(|\eta^{\mathrm{jet}}|\), but in a more typical example where the original uncertainty component is not approximately flat.

with larger NPs, the reduction can be slightly loosened and the larger eigenvectors can be combined while leaving the slightly smaller eigenvectors separate. While this does not provide a good global correlation structure, it can be useful to target specific regions which are otherwise inaccessible.

### Creating and quantifying the performance of a set of representations

#### 3.2.1 Absolute comparisons and the average regime

Three "metrics" have been defined in order to quantify the performance of a given set of strongly reduced representations. These metrics are intended to be used during the construction of a set of representations in order to determine whether the resulting set is suitable or not. If the set does not perform to the desired level, then one must either further modify the set or construct a new set in order to further progress.

The first metric builds a new matrix by comparing each representation within the set at each point where the function is evaluated to determine the minimum difference between any of the representations and the full correlation matrix for the given point. If \(\{\text{Rep}_{\text{str.red}}\}\) is the set of strongly reduced representations, \(\text{Rep}^{i}_{\text{str.red}}\) is a given representation within that set, and \(\text{Corr}^{i}_{\text{str.red}}\) is the corresponding correlation matrix, then the first metric is:

\[\texttt{Metric1}=\text{sign}\left[\text{Corr}_{\text{full}}\,-\text{Corr}^{i }_{\text{str.red}}\right]\times\min_{\text{Rep}^{i}_{\text{str.red}}\in\{ \text{Rep}_{\text{str.red}}\}}\left|\text{Corr}_{\text{full}}\,-\text{Corr}^{i }_{\text{str.red}}\right| \tag{4}\]

The sign of the difference is also important to retain, as the typical case will always have a negative difference in correlations (loss of correlation information). In the rare cases where splitting two-point systematics has managed to increase the amount of available correlation information, this is important to know, as it means that the nominal correlation structure has been directly bracketed.

Another possible way to probe the sensitivity of an analysis to correlations is to consider the difference between different strongly reduced representations with \(\{\text{Rep}_{\text{str.red}}\}\). If the maximal change in correlations between \(\text{Rep}^{i}_{\text{str.red}}\) and \(\text{Rep}^{j}_{\text{str.red}}\) in \(\{\text{Rep}_{\text{str.red}}\}\) is larger than the smallest difference between the full representation and the strongly reduced representation, as evaluated at each relevant point in parameter space, then tests of the different strongly reduced representations is a suitable alternative to a direct bracketing of the nominal correlations. In other words, the difference between the representations is larger than the difference between \(\text{Rep}_{\text{full}}\) and the closest \(\text{Rep}_{\text{str.red}}\) for each point in parameter space. In this case, the metric becomes:

\[\texttt{Metric2}=\max\left(\left|\texttt{Metric1}\right|-\begin{bmatrix} \text{Rep}^{i}_{\text{str.red}}+\text{Rep}^{j}_{\text{str.red}}\\ \text{max}\\ \text{Rep}^{i}_{\text{str.red}},\text{Rep}^{j}_{\text{str.red}}\,\text{e}\{ \text{Rep}_{\text{str.red}}\}\end{bmatrix}\left|\text{Corr}^{i}_{\text{str. red}}-\text{Corr}^{j}_{\text{str.red}}\right|\right),0\right) \tag{5}\]

When working with some experimental systematics, there are multiple full representations. One is typically considered to be the nominal scenario, while the others vary the assumptions which went into the construction of \(\text{Rep}_{\text{full}}\). These alternative full representations can then be considered as providing an estimate of the uncertainty on the correlations themselves. So far this is primarily the case for the ATLAS JES [1], although the same principle would apply to other experimental uncertainties if such alternative full representations were to be derived. While these alternative scenarios are available for the JES, they typically add significant complications yet have a minimal impact, and thus the procedure is simplified for the average analysis.

For analyses interested in the strongly reduced representations, the simplified approach to alternative correlation scenarios is followed. As such, it was decided that \(\{\text{Rep}_{\text{str.red}}\}\) and \(\text{Rep}_{\text{full}}\) are equally justifiable representations so long as any differences lie within the correlation uncertainties. For this reason, the correlation uncertainties on \(\text{Rep}_{\text{full}}\) can be taken into account when evaluating the performance of a given set of strongly reduced representations. The metric accounting for this is:

\[\texttt{Metric3}=\max\left(\texttt{Metric2}-\begin{bmatrix}\text{Rep}_{ \text{full}}^{\text{unc.}i}\neq\text{Rep}_{\text{full}}^{\text{unc.}j}\\ \text{max}\\ \text{Rep}_{\text{full}}^{\text{unc.}i},\text{Rep}_{\text{full}}^{\text{unc.}i }\in\{\text{Rep}_{\text{full}}^{\text{unc.}i}\}\end{bmatrix}\left|\text{Corr}_{ \text{full}}^{\text{unc.}i}-\text{Corr}_{\text{full}}^{\text{unc.}j}\right| \right|,0\right) \tag{6}\]

In the above, \(\{\text{Rep}_{\text{full}}^{\text{unc}}\}\) is the set of alternative uncertainty scenarios, \(\text{Rep}_{\text{full}}^{\text{unc.}i}\) is a particular alternative scenario, and \(\text{Corr}_{\text{full}}^{\text{unc.}i}\) is the associated correlation matrix.

The ideal situation would be to include the different assumptions leading to the derivation of the set of uncertainties directly within the different strongly reduced representations and to use Metric2. However, this would require the set of strongly reduced representations to grow in size. Given that the analyses of interest already ignore this possible dependence, it was decided that Metric3 provides a suitable means of quantifying the performance of a given set of strongly reduced representations. The developer can use Metric3 to determine whether or not their set of strongly reduced representations provides adequate coverage of the correlation structure, where the definition of adequate coverage may vary by developer.

#### 3.2.2 Relative comparisons and the strongly correlated regime

While the difference between correlation matrices provides one means of quantifying the level of lost correlation information, it is not always the most relevant quantity. In the regime of very strong correlations, small absolute changes can have a very large impact. If the simple example of a data-driven normalization as per Equation 1 is considered, and if the simplifying assumption of \(\delta N_{\text{MC}}^{\text{SR}}=\delta N_{\text{MC}}^{\text{CR}}\) is made, the following relative uncertainty on the estimate is derived:

\[\delta N_{\text{estimate}}^{\text{SR}} =\sqrt{\left(\delta N_{\text{MC}}^{\text{SR}}\right)^{2}+\left( \delta N_{\text{MC}}^{\text{CR}}\right)^{2}+2\,\text{Cov}\left(N_{\text{MC}}^ {\text{SR}},\,N_{\text{MC}}^{\text{CR}}\right)}\] \[\delta N_{\text{estimate}}^{\text{SR}} =\sqrt{2}\delta N_{\text{MC}}^{\text{SR}}\sqrt{1-\text{Corr} \left(N_{\text{MC}}^{\text{SR}},\,N_{\text{MC}}^{\text{CR}}\right)} \tag{7}\]

Large correlation values then become very important, as the uncertainty is significantly reduced as \(\text{Corr}\left(N_{\text{MC}}^{\text{SR}},\,N_{\text{MC}}^{\text{CR}}\right)\) approaches 1 (fully correlated). Taking the ratio of the \(\text{Rep}_{\text{full}}\) to \(\text{Rep}_{\text{str.red}}\) then gives:

\[\delta N_{\text{estimate}}^{\text{SR}}\Big{|}_{\text{str.red}}^{\text{full}}= \frac{\delta N_{\text{estimate}}^{\text{SR}}\Big{|}_{\text{full}}}{\delta N_{ \text{estimate}}^{\text{SR}}\Big{|}_{\text{str.red}}}=\frac{\sqrt{1-\text{ Corr}\left(N_{\text{MC}}^{\text{SR}},\,N_{\text{MC}}^{\text{CR}}\right)_{\text{ full}}}}{\sqrt{1-\text{Corr}\left(N_{\text{MC}}^{\text{SR}},\,N_{\text{MC}}^{\text{CR}} \right)_{\text{str.red}}}} \tag{8}\]

If the full representation is 98% correlated and the strongly reduced representation is 99% correlated, this corresponds to an uncertainty on the data-driven normalization which is underestimated by a factor of \(\sqrt{2}\). This demonstrates how a small change in the absolute correlation structure can cause significant differences in the strongly correlated regime.

In order to account for this particularly sensitive region of interest, three relative metrics were considered parallel to those defined in the previous section, hereafter referred to as Metric1\({}^{\prime}\), Metric2\({}^{\prime}\), and Metric3\({}^{\prime}\). These metrics are defined to bracket 1 rather than 0, where 1 corresponds to a perfect representation of the full set, below 1 corresponds to an over-estimation of the uncertainty, and above 1 corresponds to an under-estimation of the uncertainty. Note that in reality the correlations can only be measured to a few significant digits, and thus 99.9% is considered to be the last value distinguishable from the fully correlated scenario. Also note that Equation 8 can result in a division by zero when Corr \(\left(N_{\text{MC}}^{\text{SR}},N_{\text{MC}}^{\text{CR}}\right)_{\text{str.red}}=1\). In this case, the following value is taken:

\[\delta N_{\text{estimate}}^{\text{SR}}_{\text{str.red}}^{\text{full}}=\begin{cases} 1&\text{Corr}\left(N_{\text{MC}}^{\text{SR}}\;N_{\text{MC}}^{\text{CR}}\right) _{\text{full}}=1\\ \infty&\text{Corr}\left(N_{\text{MC}}^{\text{SR}}\;N_{\text{MC}}^{\text{CR}} \right)_{\text{full}}\neq 1\end{cases} \tag{9}\]

As with the absolute comparisons, Metric3\({}^{\prime}\) was used to determine the final susceptibility of the set of strongly reduced representations to mis-estimations in the strong correlation regime.

### Performance of the JES strongly reduced representations

The set of JES strongly reduced representations \(\{\text{Rep}_{\text{str.red}}^{\text{IES}}\}\) consists of four scenarios with 3 NPs each. With only 3 NPs per scenario, it was found that each scenario required 2 NPs to be dedicated to providing a changing rudimentary representation of the full correlation structure, while the third parameter could be used to improve the correlation representation within a specific region of the parameter space. Following this approach, the four strongly reduced representations were constructed to cover the following types of correlations between jets:

1. General representation of the full parameter space, with low, medium, and high \(p_{\text{T}}^{\text{jet}}\) regimes (one NP each)
2. Preserve the low vs medium \(p_{\text{T}}^{\text{jet}}\) correlation structure and \(|\eta^{\text{jet}}|\) dependencies
3. Preserve the medium vs high \(p_{\text{T}}^{\text{jet}}\) correlation structure
4. Preserve the very high \(p_{\text{T}}^{\text{jet}}\) correlation structure

These same four classifications of jet correlations can also be covered by having three scenarios of 4 NPs each by combining multiple points from the above list into each strongly reduced representation. This was also investigated, and results were found to be consistent between four scenarios of 3 NPs each and three scenarios of 4 NPs each. In the end, it was decided to use four scenarios of 3 NPs each such that the final number of JES NPs after probing the sensitivity to correlations is 3 rather than 4.

The first of the four strongly reduced representations \(\text{Rep}_{\text{str.red}}^{\text{JES,1}}\) was already shown in Figure 5, while \(\text{Rep}_{\text{str.red}}^{\text{JES,2}}\), \(\text{Rep}_{\text{str.red}}^{\text{JES,3}}\), and \(\text{Rep}_{\text{str.red}}^{\text{JES,4}}\) are shown in Figure 7, Figure 8, and Figure 9 respectively. From these distributions, it is clear that the correlation structure of the different strongly reduced representations cover complementary regions. The exact details of how different components are combined to obtain each strongly reduced representation are provided in Table 1.

The difference \(\text{Corr}_{\text{full}}^{\text{JES}}-\text{Corr}_{\text{str.red}}^{\text{JES}}\) is shown for variable \(p_{\text{T}}^{\text{jet}}\) within each sub-plot, where each sub-plot corresponds to evaluating the correlation function for a given value of \(\eta|\eta^{\text{jet}}|\) and \(|\eta^{\text{jet}}|^{2}|\) denoted on the axes. White regions represent parameter space beyond the kinematic limit for \(\sqrt{s}=8\text{\,Te\kern-1.0ptV}\). Each sub-plot is evaluated at 100 logarithmically distributed \(p_{\text{T}}^{\text{jet}}\) values per axis, ranging from \(15\text{\,Ge\kern-1.0ptV}\) to \(2.5\text{\,Te\kern-1.0ptV}\). The top (bottom) number in each sub-plot is the maximum (mean) observed correlation difference, where the mean excludes the kinematically forbidden region.

The difference \(\text{Corr}_{\text{full}}^{\text{JES}}-\text{Corr}_{\text{str.red}}^{\text{JES}}\) is shown for variable \(p_{\text{T}}^{\text{jet}}\) within each sub-plot, where each sub-plot corresponds to evaluating the correlation function for a given value of \(\eta|\eta^{\text{jet}}|\) and \(|\eta^{\text{jet}}|^{2}|\) denoted on the axes. White regions represent parameter space beyond the kinematic limit for \(\sqrt{s}=8\text{\,Te\kern-1.0ptV}\).

The top (bottom) number in each sub-plot is the maximum (mean) observed correlation difference, where the mean excludes the kinematically forbidden region.

The difference \(\text{Corr}_{\text{full}}^{\text{JES}}-\text{Corr}_{\text{str.red}}^{\text{JES}}\) is shown for variable \(p_{\text{T}}^{\text{jet}}\) within each sub-plot, where each sub-plot corresponds to evaluating the correlation function for a given value of \(\eta|\eta^{\text{jet}}|\) and \(|\eta^{\text{jet}}|^{2}|\) denoted on the axes. White regions represent parameter space beyond the kinematic limit for \(\sqrt{s}=8\text{\,Te\kern-1.0ptV}\). Each sub-plot is evaluated at 100 logarithmically distributed \(p_{\text{T}}^{\text{jet}}\) values per axis, ranging from \(15\text{\,Ge\kern-1.0ptV}\) to \(2.5\text{\,Te\kern-1.0ptV}\). The top (bottom) number in each sub-plot is the maximum (mean) observed correlation difference, where the mean excludes the kinematically forbidden region.

The performance of the JES strongly reduced representations is shown in Figure 10, Figure 11, and Figure 12 for Metric1, Metric2, and Metric3 respectively. The correlation losses between \(\text{Rep}^{\text{JES}}_{\text{full}}\) and \(\{\text{Rep}^{\text{JES}}_{\text{str.red}}\}\) are seen to be below the level of 41%, while the amount of residual correlation losses not covered by the differences between strongly reduced representations or the correlation uncertainties is seen to be at most 19% with a mean of approximately 1%. This demonstrates how the strongly reduced representation procedure probes the vast majority of the JES correlation structure over the full parameter space.

The performance of the JES strongly reduced representations within the strongly correlated regime is shown in Figure 13, Figure 14, and Figure 15 for Metric1\({}^{\prime}\), Metric2\({}^{\prime}\), and Metric3\({}^{\prime}\) respectively. In most of the parameter space, the uncertainty on the data-driven normalization is accurately covered by \(\{\text{Rep}_{\text{str.red}}\}\). The amount of parameter space where the reductions significantly mis-represent the matrix as 100% correlated is very small, and is confined almost exclusively to narrow off-diagonal bands. In a typical analysis where coarse \(p^{\text{jet}}_{\text{T}}\) bins are used, this effect would be further reduced, as the regions in question would be averaged out and the resulting correlation of the reduced set between the CR and SR in analysis bins would no longer be 100%.

While the amount of significantly mis-represented points in the correlation matrix is minimal, there are still regions of significant deviations which are not fully covered by the set of strongly reduced representations. In particular, Figure 15 demonstrates that the use of the set of strongly reduced representations can result

in an under-estimation of the systematic uncertainty by a factor of up to 2.5. These regions remain small, but are potentially large enough to be seen in an analysis, depending on the binning being used.

In general, this demonstrates how analyses which use strongly correlated signal and control regions for data-driven normalizations may not be able to use sets of strongly reduced representations produced by this procedure. Any group which is in such a scenario must either construct the correlation matrix between the signal and control region to demonstrate that they are in a well-represented regime, or must otherwise avoid using the strongly reduced representations entirely. However, this only applies if the signal and control region differences are dominated by jet-related selections and the JES is relevant compared to other uncertainties. If the signal and control region both use jets of similar kinematics, but selection orthogonality is dominated by other means such as lepton multiplicity requirements, then it remains safe to use the strongly reduced representations.

These plots and numbers are all under the assumption of a given set of pileup conditions. Pileup in ATLAS is typically parametrized in terms of the number of reconstructed primary vertices \(N_{\mathrm{PV}}\) and the average number of collisions per bunch crossing \(\langle\mu\rangle\). The former provides a means of quantifying the amount of in-time pileup from multiple hard-scatter processes occurring in a given bunch crossing, while the latter varies with the amount of out-of-time pileup energy present from previous or subsequent bunch crossings. All results presented so far assume that a typical level of pileup is observed, where \(N_{\mathrm{PV}}\) is \(+1\sigma\) above the average observed \(N_{\mathrm{PV}}\) value for the 2012 dataset, and similarly \(\langle\mu\rangle\) is also \(+1\sigma\) above average. This represents a small deviation from the average pileup conditions, where both pileup levels are fluctuating coherently, which is the common scenario. The values of \(+1\sigma_{N_{\mathrm{PV}}}=3.7\) and \(+1\sigma_{\langle\mu\rangle}=6.2\) come from the widths of the observed \(N_{\mathrm{PV}}\) and \(\langle\mu\rangle\) distributions in the 2012 dataset as used for the derivation of the _in situ_ JES calibration and uncertainties.

While this is a reasonable assumption to use as a baseline, it is important to understand how the correlation coverage provided by the set of strongly reduced representations changes under varying pileup conditions. A grid of different pileup scenarios is considered, with the results summarized in Table 2. A clear dependence is observed, where the magnitude of the loss of correlations depends primarily on whether \(N_{\mathrm{PV}}\) and \(\langle\mu\rangle\) are varied coherently or not. If the two fluctuations are within \(1\sigma\) of being varied coherently, then pileup effects are typically sub-dominant with respect to the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{jet}}\) and \(|\eta^{\mathrm{jet}}|\) dependence.

White regions on the edge of each sub-plot represent parameter space beyond the kinematic limit for \(\sqrt{s}=8\,\text{Te\kern-1.0ptV}\), while white regions within the core of each sub-plot represent points where the strongly reduced representations are all 100% correlated while the full representation is not. Each sub-plot is evaluated at 100 logarithmically distributed \(p_{\text{T}}^{\text{jet}}\) values per axis, ranging from \(15\,\text{Ge\kern-1.0ptV}\) to \(2.5\,\text{Te\kern-1.0ptV}\). The top (bottom) number in each sub-plot is the maximum (mean) observed value of Metric3\({}^{\prime}\), where the mean excludes the kinematically forbidden and 100% correlated regions.

If the two differ by \(2\sigma\) or more, then significant losses in correlations are observed. These large losses primarily occur when comparing either low \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) to medium \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) jets or when comparing central jets to forward jets, and become maximal when comparing low \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) forward jets to medium \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) central jets. This demonstrates how the full JES uncertainty correlation matrix depends on all six variables (\(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{jet1}}\),\(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{jet2}}\),\(\eta^{\mathrm{jet1}}\),\(\eta^{\mathrm{jet2}}\),\(N_{\mathrm{PV}}\),\(\langle\mu\rangle\)), although the transverse momentum and pseudorapidity dependencies are the primary driving factors.

Studies into breaking this limitation by adding a fifth strongly reduced representation designed to retain pileup correlations were performed, but the maximum values listed in Table 2 only varied at the level of a few percent, and thus adding another strongly reduced representation is not sufficient to address the full JES pileup dependence. To properly account for significant disparities between the \(N_{\mathrm{PV}}\) and \(\langle\mu\rangle\) conditions, the core requirement of \(N_{\mathrm{str,red}}^{\mathrm{JES}}=3\) must be relaxed and a larger number of NPs must be considered. Given that \(N_{\mathrm{PV}}\) and \(\langle\mu\rangle\) conditions vary coherently for the large majority of collisions, it was decided that the susceptibility of \(\{\mathrm{Rep}_{\mathrm{str,red}}^{\mathrm{JES}}\}\) to extreme pileup variations was not a major limitation.

## 4 Conclusion

A procedure for the reduction of a large number of independent uncertainty sources relating to a single experimental systematic has been presented. This procedure includes a general prescription for deriving a single strongly reduced representation, as well as a means of deriving multiple complementary strongly reduced representations. Each strongly reduced representation typically consists of significantly fewer independent nuisance parameters than the original representation, although the final number of parameters depends on the structure of the experimental uncertainty in question. The set of strongly reduced representations can then be used to determine whether a topology is sensitive to the resulting correlation information losses which occur when reducing the number of nuisance parameters. This provides a self-consistent means of determining whether or not any given analysis can safely use the resulting strongly reduced representation.

A case study is performed on the use of this procedure on the Jet Energy Scale. It is demonstrated that the original set of 67 independent uncertainty sources can be successfully represented by a set of four strongly reduced representations, where each strongly reduced representation consists of three nuisance parameters. As such, after a particular measurement confirms that they are insensitive to the lost correlation information, only three parameters are required to describe this experimental systematic uncertainty.

This approach will undoubtedly prove useful to searches for new physics, which are typically limited by statistical or theoretical uncertainties rather than experimental systematics, or measurements where certain experimental uncertainties are sub-dominant. As the LHC resumes collisions at a new energy frontier, this new approach will significantly reduce the time required for ATLAS analyses to understand whether or not new physics has been observed.
