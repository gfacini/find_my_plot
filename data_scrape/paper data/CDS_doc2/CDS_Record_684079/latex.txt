Due to the high neutron and charge particle fluxes at the ATLAS-Inner Detector, it is very probable to have many radioactive isotopes produced from the materials used in the detector construction. Depending on the amount of material used and the lifetime of the isotope produced, the resulting activity may be quite high and it should be taken into account particularly during the detector maintenance when the beam is off. It is also very important to evaluate the TRT active gas activity during the run period, because part of the gas is supposed to be always in accessible areas.

### 1.1. Calculation of Activity

There are several processes to produce radioactive isotopes like (n,\(\gamma\)), (n,2n), (\(\pi\),p) etc. Among those, neutron capture process has the highest significance for TRT activation because of its large cross section at low neutron energies. Other reactions are very important at high energies but cross section in this region is rather low. For instance, for activation of the TRT active gas \({}^{11}\)C isotope can be produced in reaction like (n,2n) or (\(\pi\),n) at particle energies above 20 MeV. At these energies cross section is about 20 mb and calculated maximum activity of 1 kg of Carbon (or Fluorine) is about 10\({}^{-4}\) mCi, whereas for 1 kg of Xe activated by slow neutron, the maximum activity is 0.4 mCi. The dominating low energy neutron flux in the TRT region, as well as the high neutron capture cross-sections of the nuclides at low energies, motivate the study of (n,\(\gamma\)) reactions.

Activity is defined as the number of decays per second, but a specific activity, which takes into account the number of particles emitted per decay, is considered here. The specific activity A can be calculated as:

\[A=\Phi\cdot\sigma\cdot N\cdot M\cdot X\cdot(build\ up)\cdot(decay) \tag{1.1}\]

where: \(\Phi\) is the neutron flux (kHz/cm\({}^{2}\) ), \(\sigma\) is the neutron capture cross-section (10barn), N is the number of parent atoms per unit mass (atoms/g), M is the mass of element considered (g), and X is the number of particles emitted per decay. The effect of build-up and decay are calculated as:

\[(build\;up)=1\;-\;e^{\;-(\;\lambda\;\cdot\;T\;)}\;\;,\;\;\;\;\;(decay)=e^{\;-( \;\lambda\;\cdot\;t\;)} \tag{1.2}\]

where \(\lambda=(ln2)/T_{1/2}\), \(T_{1/2}\) is the half life, \(T\) is the irradiation time (a maximum running time of 100 days per year is assumed at the LHC), and \(t\) is the decay time (the rest of the year \(\approx 250\) days). The build up factor determines how many isotopes of our interest are produced during the irradiation time which is the run period taken as 100 days for a year. When the beam is off, the decay factor calculates the number of decays for the rest of the year. The neutron flux values for different energy ranges are considered as described in Section 1.3 The cross sections for each nuclide are read from data files [1] which contain about \(10^{3}\)-\(10^{4}\) points and then their average is calculated for each energy range considered in the neutron flux mapping.

### 1.2. Radiation Dose and CERN Safety Limits

The standard unit of activity is Becquerel (Bq) which is number of particles per second. Relation between often used Curie (Ci), and Becquerel is 1 Ci = 3.7\(\times 10^{10}\) Bq (or 3.7 \(\times 10^{10}\) sec\({}^{-1}\)). The product of the absorbed dose in tissue due to radiation, so called the dose equivalent, is expressed in units of Sievert (Sv: 1 Sv = 1 J/kg).

There are two types of decays which should be considered separately, gamma and bet a decays. For the gamma decays, so called 'gamma exposure factor' (also known as the specific gamma constant) should be taken into account. It relates the activity of a point source with a certain energy to the dose equivalent at a distance. This specific gamma constant \(\Gamma\) is given in Figure 1.1 (right vertical axis) where, the relation between a point like activity of 1 Ci with the given photon energy in MeV and the equivalent dose at a distance of 1 meter in units of R/h, is presented (R:rad, 100R=1Sv) [2].

One should note that \(\Gamma\) behaves almost linearly after its minimum. Hence, after converting to convenient units, the function in Figure 1.2 can be used to calculate the radiation dose. The specific gamma constant for a 1 mCi point source at a distance of 1 meter is [3]:

\[\Gamma=\Sigma_{i}(5.6\times f_{i}\times E_{i}) \tag{1.3}\]

The inverse square law is used to calculate the dose at different distances. The equivalent dose from a 1 mCi point source at a distance of \(D\) meters is \(\frac{\Gamma}{D^{2}}\ \mu Sv/h\).

Figure 1.1: Specific Gamma Constant.

The CERN safety limits for gamma radiation [4] are summarised in Table 1.1. For radiation workers, the maximum allowed dose over a year is 15 mSv (15 mSv/y: 7.5 \(\mu\)Sv/h, considering 2000 working hours per year), however 4 mSv per month should not be exceeded (4 mSv/month: 25 \(\mu\)Sv/h, considering 180 working hours per month). Although the CERN limit is 15 mSv/year, the design limit is 5 mSv/year (e.g. maximum 50 hours in region with 100 \(\mu\)Sv/h, or 5 hours in region with 1 mSv/h), where a maximum limit of 1 mSv/month should be considered [4].

For beta particles, the effective dose from a point like source with 1 mCi activity at a distance of 1 meter is \(\approx\)280 \(\mu\)Sv/h, regardless of the \(\beta\) energy [3]. This calculation neglects any air shielding which can be significant, since the range of a \(\beta\) particle in air is 3.7 meters per MeV (this corresponds to \(\approx\)1mm/MeV in lead, \(\approx\)1.5mm/MeV in stainless steel, \(\approx\)4mm/MeV in aluminium). Safety limits concerning \(\beta\) radiation are presented in Table 1.2 [4] for different parts of the body (1 year = 2000 working hours).

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|} \hline _Area_ & _MAX DOSE RATE_ \\ \hline \hline \({}^{1}\)Non designated & \(<\) 0.5 \(\mu\)Sv/h \\ \hline \({}^{2}\)supervised & \(<\) 7.5 \(\mu\)Sv/h \\ \hline \({}^{3}\)Simple controlled & \(<\) 100 \(\mu\)Sv/h \\ \hline \hline

### 1.3 Neutron Flux

The neutron flux values used throughout this study are taken from [5], where several different distributions are given for the TRT region as a matter of the geometry. We use just one distribution everywhere which is like an overestimated average of all distributions, Figure 1.3. Note that the units of dF/dE in Figure 1.3 is number of interactions per \(cm^{2}\times GeV\times LHC\,inter\,action\), hence to get dF/dE in \(Hz/(cm^{2}\times GeV)\) one should scale by 23x40MHz.

Figure 1.3: Neutron flux values as a function of energyTRT Components

The TRT, as a system, consists of variety of materials containing different chemical elements. Some of them have long living isotopes produced in (n,\(\gamma\)) reaction. Since the main issue of this analysis is safety aspect of the detector maintenance, such kind of isotopes should be considered particularly. The breakdown of the material composition for different TRT parts is presented in the next subsection and summary is given in Table 2.1. Table 3.1 gives information about radioactive isotopes produced after irradiation and the result of preliminary selection for further analysis.

### Detector components

#### 2.1.1 Straw

The straws contain mainly C, O, N and H elements. These elements have very low neutron capture cross section and do not produce long living isotopes. They may be ignored in further analysis, Table 3.1.

#### 2.1.2 Wire

The TRT base line wire is gold plated (0.5 \(\mu\)m) pure tungsten wire of 30 \(\mu\)m diameter. The total amount of tungsten and gold in the TRT is 2.9 kg and 0.2 kg respectively. The distribution of these materials is considered uniform across the TRT.

#### 2.1.3 End plugs and C-fibre structure

The composition of the end plugs and the C-fibre structure elements is close to that for the straws and all conclusions made in Subsection 2.1.1 are valid here.

#### 2.1.4 WEBs for the End-Cap TRT

WEB in the end-cap TRT consists of G10 (FR4) and printed circuit elements. G10 contains SiO and epoxy resin which is mainly combination of O,C,N,H. Si has only one long living isotope \({}^{30}\)Si, but its neutron cross-section is rather low and it can be ignored in further analysis, Table 3.1. WEB elements contain some amount of solder which consists of lead (Pb) and tin (Sn). Sn has a dangerous isotope and its amount in one end-cap part is about 0.78 kg. There is quite large amount of Cu ( 10 kg per EC side) which has short-living isotope and should be considered for short term access (a few days after irradiation).

### Active gas and cooling

The TRT has quite large amount of gas which is continuously irradiated.

#### 2.2.1 Active gas

Active detector volume is about 2.4 m\({}^{3}\). The TRT active gas composition is 70% Xe + 20% CF\({}_{4}\) + 10% CO\({}_{2}\). From these gases, only Xe has large neutron capture cross-section and should be considered as potentially dangerous element. One has to note that active gas circulates with a speed corresponding to one TRT gas volume exchange in an hour and part of it is situated in the zone accessible for personal. 15 kg of xenon gas was taken for the radioactivity estimate.

#### 2.2.2 Cooling gas

TRT cooling gas is CO\({}_{2}\) and it is not supposed to cause any activation problem.

#### 2.2.3 Cooling liquid

Although the amount of cooling liquid (C\({}_{4}\)F\({}_{10}\)) is rather large, its activation is negligible.

### Pipes

Active gas and cooling fluid are supplied to the TRT parts through stainless steel pipes. In the end-cap, each 16-plane wheel is connected to 4 active gas pipes, to 4 electronics cooling pipes and to 2 pipes connected to heat exchanger. There are few more pipes positioned circumferentially in each 16 plane wheel: four for electronics cooling and one for heat-exchanger. As a result, total amount of material in stainless steel pipes is 35 kg distributed uniformly over outer End-cap TRT surface and 14 kg distributed gradually (number of supply lines is increased towards the end of TRT End-Cap). Each barrel side is connected to outside world through 176 pipes, which adds 67.5 kg of stainless steel distributed uniformly over the barrel cryostat wall. Composition of the material is taken from real specification.

### Squirrel cage

The end-cap part of the TRT is situated in the squirrel cage, which is taken as Al cylinder with 6 mm wall thickness (this consideration also includes the cable trays). Composition of the material is taken from real specification.

### ASDBLR and DTMROC boards

#### 2.5.1 Printed circuits

There are two front-end boards positioned on top of the end-cap wheels. One can consider them as 1 layer of Cu (35 \(\mu\)m thickness) and solder pads which occupy 33% of surface (ASDBLR + DTMROC). Amount of the copper in the boards is 10 kg (TRT end-cap) and 4.5 kg for the barrel (including tension plane).

#### 2.5.2 Solder

As it was stated above, in the end-cap, total solder area is 33% of single board area. Solder thickness was taken as 135 \(\mu\)m. The total amount of solder in the end-cap was found to be 12.6 kg. For the barrel, solder is presented on the front-end boards and tension plane as well. Total amount of solder in the barrel is considered to be 5 kg.

#### 2.5.3 Capacitors

Capacitors are not very radioactive elements if they do not contain tantalum.

#### 2.5.4 Resistors

Resistors, normally, do not contain dangerous elements in amount which should be considered, but exact composition is not known.

#### 2.5.5 Electronic chips

Electronics chips have plastic package and quite little amount of Si. The only components which might be considered are pins. The exact composition of pins is not known, but their amount is not very large in comparison with other TRT components.

#### 2.5.6 Connectors

The same statement as for chip pins is valid for the connectors.

### 2.6 Cables

In the end-cap part of the TRT, cables contain 65 kg of Cu. Each individual signal Cu wire is covered by thin layer of silver. Total amount of Ag in the endcap TRT cables is 3.1 kg. For the barrel total amount of Cu is 40.6 kg and silver is 1.9 kg.

### 2.7 Conductive plating

For the proper grounding contact, the pipe supports in the end-cap wheels are supposed to be plated with optalloy which contains Zn, Sn and Cu. Total amount of optalloy material is about 0.4 kg and its distribution is uniform over outer end-cap surface.

### 2.8 Element distribution

The same chemical elements are used in several different components of the TRT system. The summary of chemical element distributions in different TRT parts is given in Table 2.1.

## 3 Properties of Elements and Activity Calculations

28 chemical elements were identified in TRT to be investigated, out of which 14 seem to be important for our consideration. That means they have rather long half-lives and/or have very high neutron-capture cross-sections. A summary of the natural abundance, possible radioactive products, their half-lives and maximum cross-section for (n,\(\gamma\)) reaction are given in Table 3.1[6].

Isotopes with half-lifes much less than a day or more than 10 years, or with parent nuclides neutron capture cross-section below 10\({}^{2}\) barn are ignored. Xenon is a special case; since the gas will be circulated in the detector and 25% of it will always be outside the detector where people will have to have access, half-lifes of hours and even minutes have to be considered. Assuming that it takes the gas 3 minutes to travel from detector to container, half-lifes below minutes are neglected.

The neutron capture cross-sections [1] of the dangerous isotopes are presented in Appendix A, (Figure A.1 to Figure A.27) and the necessary parameters for the calculation of gamma activities are tabulated in Table 3.2[7]. K is the factor (branching ratio) which allows one to obtain the cross-section for the particular state of isotope from the total neutron capture cross-section of the parent nuclide [8]. Hence, the cross-sections presented in Appendix A must be multiplied by the K value of the isotope, before being used in activity calculation. Number of photons per decay (X) is shown in this table as well. Radioisotopes that emit \(\beta\) particles are listed in Table 3.3, of course, in this case the number of particles emitted per decay (X) is 1 by definition.

The gamma activity of each isotope is calculated for 1 kg of the bulk material ( Appendix B, Figure B.1 to Figure B.29), so that it is easy to estimate the total activity by scaling to the amount of the material to be used.

*In the case of \({}^{122}\)Sn, the cross-section for meta-state is much higher than the normal isotope.
*Since no ratio between the cross-sections for \({}^{198}\)Au and \({}^{198m}\)Au was available, \({}^{198}\)Au has been considered to be dominant since \({}^{198m}\)Au decays to \({}^{198}\)Au anyway.

Table 3.2: Parameters for calculating activityA summary of the gamma activity of 1 kg of each element is presented in Table 3.4 for different time periods after LHC shutdown. Elements like W and Au have large activities, but are short-lived, hence have decreasing contribution to the overall activity. In contrast to that, relatively long-lived elements like Cr, Zn, Ag and Sn would have an almost constant level of contribution to the total activity. The beta activities for different elements are presented in Table 3.5.

The total activity of each material for different distributions is presented in Table 4.1 (for gamma activity) and Table 4.2 (for beta activity).

In order to calculate the equivalent dose from each material, we need to know the distribution. Since each element has a different gamma exposure factor, effective dose from each must be calculated separately. Note that if the element has a single radioisotope, the gamma exposure factor for that element doesn't change in time, but if it has multi radioisotopes the gamma exposure factor changes in time because contribution from each isotope changes since they have different lifetimes (Table 4.3, Table 4.4).

There are 3 cases (Figure 4.1) to consider for maintenance after LHC shutdown: CASE 1; access to the detector from the sides without dismounting anything and without emptying the straw gas, CASE 2; emptying the straw gas, dismounting the end cap, working near the barrel side, CASE 3; working by the removed end cap.

Resulting equivalent dose rates from maximum possible induced \(\gamma\) activities are presented and described in Appendix C, Figure C.1 to Figure C.7 for different time periods after LHC shutdown. In Table 4.5, the maximum gamma radiation dose rates are summarized for the three different cases after different periods. Table 4.6 gives the maximum dose rates for beta radiation where no shielding effect has been considered. It should be noted that, the values given for case 1 and case 2 in Tables 4.5 & 4.6 are maximum rates as one moves radially outwards from the center. These maximum rates are 2(3) times the rate at the center for case 1(2).

One can see that gamma radiation dose rate exceeds the level of 100 \(\mu\)Sv/h, hence time of access has to be restricted. For beta-radiation, the dose-rate is much higher than the limit given in Section 1.2. In the calculation of the dose rates for beta activity no attenuation factor was taken into account, although this radiation will be strongly attenuated by upper layers of the material. Beta radiation dose rate drops substantially down after 10 days, and this time, probably should be considered as a time for the real access. Largest activity after 10 days is from W, Sn, Ag, and Fe.

TRT gas system contains \(\sim\)20 kg of xenon with a total maximum activity of \(\sim\)8 mCi. In that case, special study is necessary for various gas system components like buffers, filters, storage, circulation pipes etc. which can be accessible during LHC operation. The detailed analysis can be found in [9]. Special attention for shielding of the gas system elements containing large amount of xenon has to be considered [9].

Table 4.5: Maximum gamma radiation dose ratesConclusions

In this work, we have tried to estimate radiation dose rate levels for the different TRT components during LHC operation at maximum luminosity. Accurate TRT material composition known up to date was taken into account but, definitely, there are uncertainities coming from some missing parts (like for example, patch pannels) or neutron energy spectrum. The calculations can be easily corrected for a new data scaling. This procedure is explained in Appendix D, where the case of replacing silver in the cables with tin is presented as an example. It turns out that, avoiding silver in the cables will decrease the maximum dose rate of 105 \(\mu\)Sv/h for CASE 1 just after LHC shutdown by \(\sim\)38 \(\mu\)Sv/h, whereas the introduced tin will only add \(\sim\)0.2 \(\mu\)Sv/h to the overall dose. This shows that the choice of cable material is very critical in terms of radiation safety issues.

At this point, one should study possible options in the material breakdown. The first option is the replacement of the silver in the cables by tin, as mentioned above. The second option is to have 10mg of silver (instead of 19mg) in the epoxy at the ends of the barrel straws, which will half the amount of silver at the barrel sides. A revised version of Table 4.5 in the framework of these two options is given in Table 5.1 below.

Table 5.1. Maximum gamma radiation dose rates - with new options

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|} \cline{2-4} \multicolumn{1}{c|}{} & \multicolumn{2}{|c|}{Maximum dose rate at surface after:} \\ \cline{2-4} \multicolumn{1}{c|}{} & 0 days & 2 days & 10 days \\ \hline Access to the TRT system (CASE 1) & 69 \(\mu Sv/h\) & 33 \(\mu Sv/h\) & 17 \(\mu Sv/h\) \\ \hline Access to barrel detector(CASE 2) & - & 97 \(\mu Sv/h\) & 77 \(\mu Sv/h\) \\ \hline Access to the dismounted end-cap (CASE 3) & - & 15 \(\mu Sv/h\) & 5 \(\mu Sv/h\) \\ \hline \end{tabular}

The calculations were carried out for different TRT access and maintainance scenarios. They show that dose rates are quite high but still within safety requirements. Some special safety measures have to be considered during maintenance operations.

One has to stress that only TRT material (and partly, LAr cryostat wall) have been taken into account. In order to have realistic dose rate estimate during ATLAS Inner Detector access, all ATLAS parts which are close to Inner Detector volume must be considered. Such a study has been done in [10], but the TRT material breakdown and the neutron flux considered in [10] is different than ours (see Appendix E Table E.1 for a rough material composition comparison).

## Appendix C Resulting Radiation Dose Rates

In this section, radiation dose rates as a function of position for different periods of time and different access scenarios are presented. As defined in Section 4, there are 3 scenarios considered in terms of access to the detector for maintenance. In Figure C.1 to Figure C.3, access to the fully operational TRT system (CASE 1: nothing has been dismounted, straw gas is not emptied, etc.) is studied for 0, 2 and 10 days after LHC shutdown. Figure C.4 and Figure C.5 describe the access into the TRT system after removing one of the end-caps in order to reach the barrel TRT (CASE 2: straw gas emptied, end-cap removed, etc.), for 2 and 10 days after LHC shutdown. Access to the removed end-cap from the cylindrical surface is shown in Figure C.6 and Figure C.7 (for 2 and 10 days after LHC shutdown), where every level on the graphs represents a distance of 20 cm from the detector (maximum level is the surface, every decrease corresponds to 20 cm of distance from surface). For CASE 1 and CASE 2, all the dose rates are calculated assuming that the approach is from the center as drawn in Figure 4.1, however the dose rates increase as one moves radially out-wards, and the maximum level is larger by a factor of 2 than in the central position for case 1 and factor of 3 for case 2. The numbers given in Table 4.5 already include this factor.

## Appendix D Tool for Dose Rate Calculation

For practical purposes, some normalization factors and guidance is presented here for the user to estimate the equivalent dose rate of any material introduced in any distribution. As already defined in Section 4, 3 different cases are considered:

**CASE 1:** access to the detector from the sides without dismounting anything and without emptying the straw gas.

**CASE 2:** emptying the straw gas, dismounting the end cap, accessing the barrel side.

**CASE 3:** working near the removed end cap.

There are several different distributions in each case:

**Volume:** this mainly considers the straw material and gas inside.

**EC-surface:** distribution of electronics boards, webs, plate cooling supports, squirrel cage and pipes on the outer end-cap surface

**EC-nonuniform:** distribution of cables and pipes coming out from each end-cap wheel, on the outer end-cap surface.

**BR-side:** solder and grounding material on the sides of the barrel.

**BR-service:** Barrel service elements like pipes and cables which are attached to the cryostat walls.

**Cryostat:** cryostat wall material

Of course for CASE 3, only Volume, EC-surface and EC-nonuniform are relevant. It is important to know the amount, activity per kg (Table 3.4 for gamma activity, Table 3.5 for beta activity), gamma exposure constant (Table 4.3 or Table 4.4) and the distribution region in order to estimate the equivalent dose rate on the surface of the detector. As it was stated in Section 1.2, for beta-particles, the relation between the activity and the dose rate at distance of 1 meter is A(mCi)x280 in \(\mu\)Sv/h. Then, using Table D.1, which gives the maximum radiation dose rate on surface for A(mCi)\(\times\Gamma\)=1, one can scale to the desired A(mCi)\(\times\Gamma\) and calculate the dose rate.

**EXAMPLE :**

Calculation of the contribution of the silver in TRT to the overall radiation dose for CASE 1 just after LHC shutdown. Silver is distributed in 3 different regions, hence each should be considered separately:

\(E\) C-nonuniform: There are \(\sim\)3 kg of silver in this region.

**step1:** From Table 3.4, activity/kg of silver 0 days after LHC shutdown is 3.05 mCi/kg. Hence total activity of 3 kg is 3x3.05=9.15 mCi.

**step 2:** From Table 4.3, gamma exposure factor for silver is 4.8

**step 3:** Product of total activity and gamma exposure factor is A (mCi)x\(\Gamma\)=9.15x4.8=43.9

**step 4:** Dose rate from Table D.1 for A\(\times\Gamma\)=1 is 0.53. Then scaling this number to the value found in step 3 one can obtain 0.53x43.9=23.3

Hence the maximum gamma radiation dose rate from 3 kg silver on the non-uniform end-cap surface 0 days after LHC run is \(\sim\) 23 \(\mu\)Sv/h.

\(B\) R-side: There are \(\sim\)2 kg of silver in this region.

**step1:** From Table 3.4, activity/kg of silver 0 days after LHC shutdown is 3.05 mCi/kg. Hence total activity of 2 kg is 2x3.05=6.1 mCi.

**step 2:** From Table 4.3, gamma exposure factor for silver is 4.8

**step 3:** Product of total activity and gamma exposure factor is A (mCi)x\(\Gamma\)=6.1x4.8=29.3

**step 4:** Dose rate from Table D.1 for A\(\times\Gamma\)=1 is 0.14. Then scaling this number to the value found in step 3 one can obtain 0.14x29.3=4.1

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|} \hline  & \multicolumn{1}{|l|}{Maximum radiation dose rate (\(\mu\)Sv/h) on surface for A(mCi)\(\times\Gamma\)=1} \\  & \multicolumn{1}{|l|}{distributed over the region indicated on left column for:} \\  & \multicolumn{1}{|l|}{CASE 1} & \multicolumn{1}{|l|}{CASE 2} & \multicolumn{1}{|l|}{CASE 3} \\ \hline Volume & 0.49 & 0.82 & 0.9 \\ \hline EC-surface & 0.37 & 0.22 & 1.4 \\ \hline EC-nonuniform & 0.53 & 0.17 & 1.9 \\ \hline BR-side & 0.14 & 2.01 & - \\ \hline BR-service & 0.37 & 0.68 & - \\ \hline Cryostat & 0.36 & 0.65 & - \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table D.1: Scale factors for different distributions in different casesHence the maximum gamma radiation dose rate from 2 kg silver on the barrel side surface 0 days after LHC run is \(\sim\) 4 \(\mu\)Sv/h.

_B_R-_service:_ There are \(\sim\)2 kg of silver in this region.

**step1:**: From Table 3.4, activity/kg of silver 0 days after LHC shutdown is 3.05 mCi/kg. Hence total activity of 2 kg is 2x3.05=6.1 mCi.

**step 2:**: From Table 4.3, gamma exposure factor for silver is 4.8

**step 3:**: Product of total activity and gamma exposure factor is A(mCi)x\(\Gamma\)=6.1x4.8=29.3

**step 4:**: Dose rate from Table D.1 for A\(\times\Gamma\)=1 is 0.37. Then scaling this number to the value found in step 3 one can obtain 0.37x29.3=10.8

Hence the maximum gamma radiation dose rate from 2 kg silver on barrel services 0 days after LHC run is \(\sim\) 11 \(\mu\)Sv/h.

As a result, the total dose rate coming from silver for CASE 1 after 0 days is \(\sim\)38\(\mu\)Sv/h.

If silver is replaced by tin, only the activity per kg, \(\Gamma\) and mass would change:

Total mass will be 0.7 that of silver because of the density difference. Since the distribution and the relative amounts in different distributions will be exactly as silver, the result found for silver can simply be normalized to find the dose rate:

\[38\mu\)Sv/h \(\times\frac{\left|A\left[mCi\right]\times\Gamma\right|_{S_{n}}}{\left|A \left[mCi\right]\times\Gamma\right|_{Ag}}\times\frac{\rho_{S_{n}}}{\rho_{Ag}} =38\times\frac{0.304\times 0.3}{3.05\times 4.8}\times\frac{0.7}{7}=0.17\mu\)Sv/h

Hence if the silver in the cables is replaced with tin, \(\sim\)38\(\mu\)Sv/h of radiation will be avoided and only \(\sim\)0.2\(\mu\)Sv/h of radiation will be introduced.

## Appendix E : TRT Material Breakdown considered in [10]

In [10], the amounts of materials are presented for half of the detector. In order to compare with our material distribution, the values in [10]-Table 14 are doubled. Note that the TRT services have not been taken into account in Table E.1 and in our analysis. Table E.1 does not contain cryostat wall materials either.

Table E.1. Total amount of TRT material considered in our analysis and in [10]

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|} \hline  & V.A. Klimanov et al. [10] & Our consideration \\ \hline Cu & 246kg & 141kg \\ \hline Al & 568kg & 536kg \\ \hline Fe & 56kg & 86kg \\ \hline Cr & 15kg & 23kg \\ \hline Zn & 3.2kg & 1.4kg \\ \hline Sn & 4.4kg & 14kg \\ \hline Au & 0.24kg & 0.22kg \\ \hline Ag & 0.52kg & 7kg \\ \hline W & 3kg & 2.9kg \\ \hline \end{tabular}

The major difference between the two analysis is that [10] doesn't include the cables. It should be noted that if tin replaces silver in the cables, the amount of silver will decrease by 5 kg and tin will increase by 3.5 kg.
