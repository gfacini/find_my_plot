1. Introduction

Even at luminosities as high as those foreseen at the LHC machine, electrons will be relatively easy to measure with electromagnetic calorimetry. The electron energy measurements will be carried out over small areas, typically of the order of 0.1 x 0.1 in \(\Delta\eta\) x \(\Delta\phi\), where \(\eta\) is the pseudorapidity and \(\phi\) the azimuth, and therefore distorsions to these energy measurements due to pile-up are expected to be small.

Electrons will however be extremely difficult to identify, and electron identification studies for LHC have to concentrate mainly on background studies and detector capabilities to reject these backgrounds. As we shall see below, calorimetry is one of the key elements in electron identification at these machines, but is not sufficiently powerful in itself to achieve unambiguous electron identification.

In the following, after a reminder of the basic electron identification requirements at LHC, we shall concentrate mainly on a comparative study of the electron identification abilities of detectors with or without central magnetic field.

2. Basic electron identification requirements

2.1 Acceptance

As has been shown in previous studies [1], electron identification is required over a large solid angle, i.e. down to small angles with respect to the proton beams (\(\eta\)) \(\leq\) 3), and over a large range of transverse momenta, \(\rm p_{T}^{\rm d}\), typically 10 \(\leq\rm p_{T}^{\rm k}\leq\) 2000 GeV. This is illustrated below with three examples:

a) Let us consider the case of a Higgs boson, H, of mass \(\rm m_{H}\) = 120 GeV, decaying into four leptons (electrons or muons). The acceptance of a detector with lepton coverage over \(|\eta|\leq\) 3, is \(-\) 4% for \(\rm p_{T}^{\rm k}>\) 20 GeV and increases to \(-\) 32% for \(\rm p_{T}^{\rm k}>\) 10 GeV [2]. Since the expected event rates are very low, this particular channel will benefit greatly from lepton detection down to \(\rm p_{T}\) = 10 GeV or even lower. Similar conclusions were reached in studies of gluino cascade decays, producing Z bosons in the final state with very low event rates [3].

b) In the case of top quark physics, which can be studied at luminosities as low as \(10^{32}\) to \(10^{33}\) cm\({}^{-2}\)s\({}^{-1}\), one needs to identify if possible single electrons of \(\rm p_{T}\geq\) 40 GeV at central rapidities [4].

c) For the search for additional vector bosons, Z', decaying into electron pairs, one should achieve electron identification and measurements for \(\rm p_{T}^{\rm k}\) as large as = 2000 GeV [5].

2.2 Rejection against QCD jets

Here we take two examples from previous studies to illustrate the rejections needed against QCD jets in order to bring fake electron backgrounds safely below the signals expected at LHC.

- 4-jet events with a cross-section of \(-1\mb=10^{12}\) fb, within the same cuts and including pile-up at a luminosity of \(10^{34}\) cm\({}^{-2}\)s\({}^{-1}\).
- \(\Z\to\e^{*}\e^{-}\) events accompanied by jets, with a cross-section of the order of 500 pb. To reject such events well below the expected level of signal events, a rejection of 3000 per jet is sufficient, but is needed even for events containing two real electrons.
* Single electrons from top decay or Higgs decay (\(\PH\to\WW\to\e\e\e\)) are expected at levels much below that of electrons from b-quark and W decays. One can therefore raise the question of jet rejection in the case of a search for inclusive electrons, as illustrated in Fig. 1[6], which shows the expected event rates per unit rapidity at L = \(10^{34}\) cm\({}^{-2}\)s\({}^{-1}\) at LHC as a function of \(\PT\), for jets, \(\pi^{0}\), \(\gamma\) and electrons from b-quark and W decays. We first note that \(\pi^{0}\)/jet \(\geq 10^{-3}\) for \(\PT=40\) GeV, which shows that one cannot expect rejections better than \(10^{3}\) from calorimetry alone. We also note that e/jet = \(10^{-3}\) at \(\PT=40\) GeV, a ratio much less favourable than that found at the CERN \(\Pp\Pp\) collider, where e/jet = \(10^{-3}\) at \(\PT=40\) GeV.

We conclude from Fig. 1 that, in order to bring jet backgrounds safely below the level of single electrons, one needs rejections at LHC of:

* \(-10^{6}\) against QCD jets
* \(\geq 10^{3}\) against \(\pi^{0}\)/\(\eta\) mesons
* \(\geq 10\) against \(\pi^{0}\)/\(\eta\) Dalitz decays.

### Trigger rates

The expected trigger rates are reasonable for electron pairs, assuming that the level 1 trigger is provided by the calorimeter alone. As an example, for \(\PT>20\) GeV and \(|\eta|<2\), at L = \(10^{34}\) cm\({}^{-2}\)s\({}^{-1}\), we expect a level 1 trigger rate of \(-1000\) Hz for a calorimeter rejection of 100 per jet, which drops to \(-10\) Hz for the maximum attainable calorimeter rejection of 1000[7]. This latter rate, if at all achievable, is only a factor 2 to 3 larger than the expected trigger rate from \(\Z\to\e^{*}\e^{-}\) in the same geometrical acceptance.

On the other hand, a single electron trigger will be difficult at LHC, since the level 1 trigger rate expected would be \(-5000\) Hz for a calorimeter rejection of 1000 and for \(\PT>40\) GeV and \(|\eta|<2\). Additional rejection from tracking detectors will be certainly needed at higher trigger levels.

## 3 Backgrounds from fake electrons

Such backgrounds in hadron colliders arise from two sources:

- single charged hadrons (e.g. through charge exchange);

- charged hadron overlap with one or several photons from \(\pi^{0}\)/\(\eta\) decay.

### Detector with central magnetic field

In this case, as demonstrated by UA1 and CDF at lower energies, hadronic backgrounds are expected to be small, i.e. at a level of \(\sim 10^{-6}\) of the jet cross-section, well below the expected level for electrons from b-quark and W decay. Although this can be estimated from the ratio \(\pi^{\pm}\)/jet =\(10^{-3}\) and the probability that a charged pion produces an electromagnetic shower in the calorimeter, some redundancy in electron identification may be needed at LHC in order to control these backgrounds at high luminosity.

### Detector without central magnetic field

Past experience in UA2 has shown that hadronic backgrounds are very dangerous in this case and have to be dealt with by the inner tracking system. As an example, a combination of preshower technique [6] and transition radiation [8], which could provide independent rejections of \(\sim 100\) each against these backgrounds, would bring them down to a level well below that of prompt electrons.

## 4 Backgrounds from electron pairs

We shall now concentrate on the potentially most dangerous background to a prompt electron signal, namely electron pairs from conversions of photons from \(\pi^{0}\)/\(\eta\) decay or from \(\pi^{0}\)/\(\eta\) Dalitz decays. In this context, we have performed a simple comparative study of 'generic' detectors with and without central magnetic field, in order to evaluate their respective expected performances against these electron pair backgrounds. In particular, we have assumed that the parent \(\pi^{0}\)/\(\eta\) spectrum is the expected single \(\pi^{0}\)/\(\eta\) spectrum, and have ignored more complicated topologies containing multi-\(\pi^{0}\) final states [7].

### Electron pair production

We first generated a parent (\(\pi^{0}\) or \(\eta\)) with a \(\eta\)-spectrum \(\mathrm{d}\mathrm{e}\mathrm{/}\mathrm{d}\mathrm{p}\mathrm{T}=\mathrm{p}_{\mathrm{ T}}^{-5.5}\), as suggested by Fig. 1, for \(\mathrm{p}\mathrm{T}>\mathrm{p}_{\mathrm{T}}^{0}\) and \(|\eta|<2\). The parent \(\mathrm{p}\mathrm{T}\) threshold, \(\mathrm{p}_{\mathrm{T}}^{0}\) was usually chosen to be 10 GeV (the most difficult case). This parent was then allowed to decay following the recipe of Table 1. The ratio \(\eta\)/\(\pi^{0}\) was chosen to be 0.55, and external conversion production was normalized to the average number of photons per produced \(\pi^{0}\), including \(\eta\rightarrow\gamma\gamma\). \(\eta\to 3\pi^{0}\to 6\gamma\) and a 6% contribution from direct photons.

The branching fraction for external conversions is computed assuming 1% \(X_{0}\) at \(|\eta|=0\), a minimum corresponding to the vacuum pipe, some air and the support of the first tracking layer.

From Table 1, it appears clearly that external conversions will be the dominant source of production of electron pairs, even for as little as 1% \(X_{0}\) of material in the detector.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|} \hline Channel & Parent & Branching & Total weight & Fraction of all \\  & production rate & fraction & & e\({}^{+}\)e\({}^{-}\) pairs \\ \hline External & 3.49 & & & \\ conversions & (average & 1.56 10\({}^{-2}\) & 5.43 10\({}^{-2}\) & 72.0\% \\ for 1\% \(X_{0}\) & number of & & & \\ over \(|\eta|<2\) & photons per & & & \\  & produced \(\pi^{0}\)) & & & \\ \hline \(\pi^{0}\rightarrow\gamma\mathrm{e}+\mathrm{e}-\) & 1 & 1.20 10\({}^{-2}\) & 1.20 10\({}^{-2}\) & 15.9\% \\ \hline \(\eta\to 3\pi^{0}\rightarrow\mathrm{e}+\mathrm{e}^{-}\) & 0.55 & 1.15 10\({}^{-2}\) & 0.63 10\({}^{-2}\) & 8.4\% \\ \hline \(\eta\rightarrow\mathrm{e}^{+}\mathrm{e}^{-}\) & 0.55 & 0.50 10\({}^{-2}\) & 0.28 10\({}^{-2}\) & 3.7\% \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}

### Detector simulation

After generating e+e- pairs with the above procedure, we performed a simple detector simulation, based on two detector models corresponding to possible configurations at LHC, as described below:

a) An electromagnetic calorimeter with inner radius, R = 130 cm, and a granularity \(\Delta\eta\times\Delta\phi\) = 0.02 x 0.02, selected candidate electron clusters, under the conditions that the generated electron or positron, properly tracked through the inner detector (see below), pointed to the cluster and that the transverse energy \(\mathrm{E_{T}}\), collected over \(\Delta\eta\) x \(\Delta\phi\) = 0.06 x 0.06, was greater than \(\mathrm{p_{T}^{0}}\), the \(\mathrm{p_{T}^{-}}\)threshold for the parent particle generation. This first selection was performed for both detector models used, and is labelled TRK-CAL in the plots described below.

b) In the case of a solenoidal central magnetic field, a momentum measurement was simulated in the inner tracking region, using two measurements of 100 \(\mu\) accuracy at radii of 30 cm and 100 cm. With the knowledge of the transverse vertex position, the resulting transverse momentum measurement accuracy was \(\mathrm{\sigma_{p_{T}^{0}}/p_{T}}\) = 0.003 \(\cdot\) p_T/B, where \(\mathrm{p_{T}^{0}}\) is in GeV and B in Tesla. As shown below, the results do not depend significantly on the value assumed for the momentum measurement accuracy. A second selection, labelled E/p below, was then performed requiring the measured cluster energy E to match the measured electron or positron momentum p within E/p < 1.2.

c) In this step a charged particle isolation cut was applied at R = 100 cm, labelled Outer Isolation below, requiring only one charged particle to be present in a cone of area \(\Delta\eta\) x \(\Delta\phi\) = 0.05 x 0.05, which matches the area over which the energy is collected in the electromagnetic calorimeter and corresponds to roughly 10% occupancy at a luminosity of 2 10\({}^{34}\) cm\({}^{-2}\)s\({}^{-1}\). This cut will reject close by electron pairs and is therefore most efficient for B = 0 as will be shown below. Some care was taken to include multiple scattering, since it turns out to be the limiting factor in the efficiency of this cut for rejecting conversions at B = 0.

d) In a final step, for completeness, an additional charged particle isolation cut was applied at R = 30 cm for B = 0 over a somewhat smaller solid angle, \(\Delta\eta\) x \(\Delta\phi\) = 0.024 x 0.024, to account for the higher expected occupancy in a central magnetic field. This cut was labelled Inner Isolation in the figures presented below.

### Rejection of conversions

Figure 2 shows the expected rejection of electron pairs from photon conversions, for a parent \(\mathrm{p_{T}^{0}}\) threshold of 10 GeV, as a function of the strength of the central magnetic field. The rejection of 40 needed to bring such a background down to the desired level is also indicated, assuming 1% X\({}_{0}\) of material in front of the first sensitive tracking layer.

The rejection obtained from the TRK-CAL cut rises rapidly from 2 at B = 0 (the total parent energy is often collected in \(\Delta\eta\) x \(\Delta\phi\) = 0.06 x 0.06) to 15 at B = 4T, where the calorimeter basically selects mainly isolated electrons which therefore very often do not pass the threshold. This is confirmed by the curve which includes in addition the E/p cut for B = 0. This cut essentially results in an overall rejection independent of B, basically due to the fact that, after this cut, most of the remaining events correspond to isolated high-p_T electrons (asymmetric conversions) which are either selected by the E/p cut (low field) or the calorimeter (high field). Fig. 3 shows the E/p distribution expected for B = 0.5 T, 1.0 T and 2.0 T. A stricter cut than the one used (E/p < 1.2) is seen to be rather ineffective, the more so the higher the field, where one expects better momentum accuracy. In addition, bremsstrahlung effects which were not explicitly included in this study, are expected to result in significant losses of real electron signals for E/p cuts stricter than the one applied.

Figure 2 shows that the Outer Isolation cut provides a powerful rejection against versions at B = 0, but very little for B = 0. The Inner Isolation cut applied for B = 0 is to some extent conversions produced in the support of the inner tracking layer.

Figure 4 shows, for B = 2T, how these rejection factors vary as a function of the choice of the parent pT-threshold. As expected from kinematics, the calorimeter rejection is much worse at higher pT, but E/p recovers most of this loss, and the charged particle isolation also becomes more efficient at rejecting asymmetric conversions at high pT.

### Rejection against Dalitz decays

Fig. 5 shows the expected rejection against Dalitz decays, for a parent pT larger than 10 GeV, as a function of B. Also shown is the rejection of 20 needed against this background to bring it down to the desired level. The features of the various curves are much the same as for the case of external conversions (Fig. 2), except for the charged particle isolation cuts, which are much less powerful because of Dalitz kinematics.

### Additional rejection

The results shown in Figs. 2 and 5 for conversions and Dalitz decays show that the desired rejection can be achieved, but they are based on many optimistic assumptions:

- The electron efficiency has not been thoroughly investigated (bremsstrahlung, tracking detectors...);

- the chosen isolation cones are quite large;

- a minimum amount of material (1% X\({}_{0}\)) was assumed in front of the first tracking layer.

For these reasons, we have investigated whether the quoted rejections can be improved upon by searching for the second electron and/or nearby photon(s).

Figure 6 shows the energy spectrum of the second electron after the first three selection cuts described in Section 4.2 have been applied, for B = 0 and B = 2T and for a parent pT threshold of 10 GeV. For B = 0, the average energy of this second electron is expected to be 0.5 GeV, precluding any hope to identify it in the LHC environment. For B = 2T, the higher expected average energy of 4.0 GeV is probably sufficient to allow some additional rejection to be achieved, but any quantitative estimate implies detector specific simulations beyond the scope of this contribution.

Figure 7 shows the angular distance at the vertex between the electron candidate chosen and the largest energy photon in the event for B = 0 and B = 2T. As expected, the presence of the field forces this photon away from the electron because of the E/p cut, but also forces it to much lower energies as shown in Fig. 8.

In summary, additional rejections can be obtained by searching for a second electron of 4 GeV average energy for B = 2 T, and by searching for a photon of average energy 20 GeV at an average distance of 5 cm from the electron for B = 0.

## 5 Conclusions

The most dangerous backgrounds to electron signals at LHC arise from electron pairs produced by external conversions and Dalitz decays. An adequate rejection against the latter can be achieved in a straightforward way by 'generic' detectors independently of the presence and strength of a central magnetic field. In the case of external photon conversions, we can conclude that:

a) such backgrounds are much easier to reject in the absence of a central magnetic field, particularly at low pT (10 to 20 GeV);

b) if the detector material is \(\leq\) 1% X\({}_{0}\) in front of the first sensitive tracking layer, an adequate rejection can also be achieved in the presence of a central magnetic field, independently of its value;c) as a corollary, any tracking detector with more than 1% X\({}_{0}\) of material should provide a rejection against conversions inside its own material, given the difficult experimental environment at LHC/SSC.

The choice of a central magnetic field can certainly be justified on the basis of broader arguments, such as an obviously richer physics potential, at least at moderate luminosities. The practicality of such a choice hinges however on the crucial point of the feasability of inner tracking in the very difficult environment of these hadronic machines, a topic which is beyond the scope of a calorimeter conference.
