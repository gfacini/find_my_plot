**Abstract**

Results are reported on an analysis on simulated data samples for production of heavy quarkonium states \(J/\psi\to\mu\mu\) and \(\Upsilon\to\mu\mu\), corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 10 pb\({}^{-1}\). It is shown that the \(p_{T}\) dependence of the cross-section for both \(J/\psi\) and \(\Upsilon\) should be measured reasonably well in a wide range of transverse momenta, \(p_{T}\simeq 10-50\) GeV. The precision of \(J/\psi\) polarisation measurement is expected to reach \(0.02-0.06\), while the projected error on \(\Upsilon\) polarisation is around 0.2. Observation of radiative decays of \(\chi_{c}\) states, and the feasibility of observing \(\chi_{b}\to J/\psi J/\psi\) decays are also discussed.

Introduction and theoretical motivation

The number of \(J/\psi\,\rightarrow\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\) and \(\Upsilon\,\rightarrow\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\) decays produced at the LHC is expected to be quite large. Their importance for ATLAS is threefold: first, being narrow resonances, they can be used as tools for alignment and calibration of the trigger, tracking and muon systems. Secondly, understanding the details of the prompt onia production is a challenging task and a good testbed for various QCD calculations, spanning both perturbative and non-perturbative regimes. Last, but not the least, heavy quarkonium states are among the decay products of heavier states, serving as good signatures for many processes of interest, some of which are quite rare. These processes have prompt quarkonia as a background and, as such, a good description of the underlying quarkonium production process is crucial to the success of these studies.

This note mainly concentrates on the capabilities of the ATLAS detector to study various aspects of prompt quarkonium production at the LHC. The methods of separating promptly produced \(J/\psi\,\) and \(\Upsilon\) mesons from various backgrounds are discussed, and strategies for various measurements are outlined.

### Theory overview

Quarkonium production was originally described in a model where the quark pair was assumed to be produced endowed with the quantum numbers of the quarkonium state that it eventually evolved into [1]. This approach, subsequently labelled as the Colour Singlet Model (CSM), enjoyed some success before CDF measured an excess of direct \(J/\psi\,\) production [2], more than an order of magnitude greater than predicted (see Figure 1(a)).

The Colour Octet Model (COM) [5] was proposed as a solution to this quarkonium deficit. COM suggests that the heavy quark pairs produced in the hard process do not necessarily need to be produced with the quantum numbers of physical quarkonium, but could evolve into a particular quarkonium state through radiation of soft gluons later on, during hadronisation. This approach isolates the perturbative

(b) \(\Upsilon\) polarisation measured as a function of \(p_{T}\) at DO (black dots) and CDF (green triangles), compared to the limits of the \(k_{T}\) factorisation model (dashed and dotted curves [6]) and COM predictions [5], depicted by a shadowed band (from [4]).

hard process from the non-perturbative long-distance matrix elements, which are considered as free parameters of the theory. However, their universality means that their values can be extracted independently from a number of different processes, such as deep inelastic scattering, hadro- and photoproduction.

Hence the good description of the Tevatron data by the Colour Octet Model shown in Figure 1(a) is, at least in part, due to the fact that the values of some parameters were determined from the same data. Tests of other COM predictions have not been so successful: Figure 1(b) shows the polarisation coefficient in \(\Upsilon\,\rightarrow\mu\mu\) decay as a function of its transverse momentum, where the COM prediction disagrees with the data.

A model based on \(k_{T}\) factorisation in QCD showers [6] claims to be able to describe both the lack of transverse polarisation in \(J/\psi\,\) decays [4, 7] and the high cross-section of \(J/\psi\,\) production. Another model [8] argues that the deficit in the cross-section as predicted by CSM can be largely explained by the production of a quarkonium state in association with an additional heavy quark, and also predicts lower levels of polarisation.

In the following, we show that ATLAS is capable of detailed checks of the predictions of various models by measuring not only \(p_{T}\) and \(\eta\) distributions of onium states in a wide range of these variables, but also the degree of polarisation and the production of \(C\)-even states. In the absence of a comprehensive Monte Carlo generator capable of simulating all aspects of all theoretical models, we used the Pythia 6.403 generator [9] incorporating the Colour Octet Mechanism, with model parameters fixed through a combination of theoretical and experimental constraints [10]. Inevitably, this simulation is unable to reproduce adequately some features of the data, notably the polarisation angle distributions and hadronic accompaniment of the quarkonium states. However, the simulated samples allowed us to study the acceptance and efficiency of ATLAS to detect all required particles and measure their parameters, across the whole range of the accessible phase space.

### Classification of production mechanisms in the simulation

In the following, we will use a simple classification of the quarkonium production mechanisms based on the model implemented in the Pythia generator.

A sample diagram describing the leading colour-singlet subprocess \(g+g\to J/\psi+g\) is shown in Figure 2(a). In the accessible range of transverse momenta of \(J/\psi\,\) its contribution is expected to be small. The dominant contribution at the lower \(p_{T}\) comes from the subprocess shown in Figure 2(b), where both singlet and octet \(c\bar{c}\) states with various quantum numbers contribute to \(J/\psi\,\) production, through \(\chi_{cJ}\to J/\psi+\gamma\,\)decays and/or soft gluon emission.

At high \(p_{T}\), the gluon fragmentation subprocess shown in Figure 2(c) becomes increasingly dominant. According to COM, this is unlikely to produce anything other than \({}^{3}S_{1}\) quarkonium states. Hence,

Figure 2: Some example diagrams for the singlet and octet \(J/\psi\,\) production mechanisms implemented in Pythia.

the fraction of \(J/\psi\) mesons produced from \(\chi_{cJ}\) decays should decrease with increasing \(p_{T}\). The production mechanisms for the radially excited \(\psi^{\prime}(3686)\) meson follows the same pattern, except for the absence of respective \(\chi^{\prime}_{cJ}\) contributions, thus one should expect different \(p_{T}\) distributions for \(J/\psi\) and \(\psi^{\prime}\).

The overall picture is expected to be similar for bottomonium production, except the number of radial excitations below the open beauty threshold is now three, and many more radiative transitions are possible between the various \(n^{3}P_{J}\) and \(n^{3}S_{1}\) state. However, compared to \(J/\psi\), the accessible range of \(p_{T}\) for \(\Upsilon\) is significantly extended towards smaller transverse momenta. This opens up the range of \(p_{T}\) dominated by the colour singlet contribution, which may make it directly observable for \(\Upsilon\).

### \(\chi_{b}\to J/\psi J/\psi\) decay

Despite much higher production cross-sections, \(C\)-even states of quarkonia are far more difficult to observe than their vector counterparts. The usual way of studying \(\chi_{c,b}\) (and \(\eta_{c,b}\)) states has been so far through radiative decays of or into respective vector states. However, in the high energy hadronic collision environment, observation of the photon in \(\chi_{b}\to\Upsilon+\gamma\) may be problematic (see Section 5.1).

We have performed a feasibility study to assess the capability of ATLAS to observe \(\chi_{b}\to J/\psi d/\psi\to\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\) decay with the standard di-muon trigger. The results are presented in Section 5.2. The observation and measurement of these final states will give a valuable insight into the heavy quark bound state dynamics from several separate viewpoints.

## 2 Trigger considerations

Details of the triggers to be used in ATLAS \(B\) physics programme can be found in [11]. This section discusses the trigger signatures relevant for quarkonium production at ATLAS, the implications they have on the measured cross-section, and the expected effects they have on our ability to make various physics measurements.

Two specific types of di-muon triggers dedicated to quarkonium are: the topological di-muon triggers, which require two level-1 regions of interest (RoIs) corresponding to two muon candidates with \(p_{T}\) thresholds of 6 and 4 GeV, and di-muon triggers that only require a single level-1 RoI above a threshold of 4 GeV and searches for the second muon of opposite charge in a wide RoI at level-2. They are discussed in Section 2.1. An additional trigger scenario is based on a single muon trigger with a higher \(p_{T}\) threshold of 10 GeV, discussed in Section 2.2.

### Di-muon triggers

Being able to determine the trigger efficiency of measured \(J/\psi\) and \(\Upsilon\) is crucial to correctly infer the production cross-section of quarkonium at the LHC. Indeed, using \(J/\psi\) and \(\Upsilon\) (as well as the \(Z\) boson) to construct a trigger efficiency map is a necessary step in order to perform cross-section measurements in ATLAS.

Studies are being conducted in ATLAS into developing a calibration method to obtain the low-\(p_{T}\) single muon trigger efficiency, and henceforth the di-muon trigger efficiency of events using real data by virtue of the so-called tag-and-probe method (see Ref. [11] for details). In the absence of data, we have performed our own studies of trigger efficiencies, based on Monte Carlo simulation.

If not stated otherwise, the quoted trigger efficiencies have been calculated with respect to the Monte Carlo samples, generated with the cuts \(p_{T}(\mu_{1})>6\) GeV, \(p_{T}(\mu_{2})>4\) GeV, where \(\mu_{1}\) (\(\mu_{2}\)) is the muon with the largest (second largest) transverse momentum in the event.

The level-1 trigger is a hardware trigger that uses coarse calorimeter and muon spectrometer information to identify interesting signatures to pass to the level-2 and Event Filter stage. Figure 3 shows the various individual level-1 trigger efficiencies as a function of the \(p_{T}\) of the di-muon system. The total trigger efficiency at level-1, running over direct \(J/\psi\) events, is 87%.

The level-2 trigger is software-based and is designed to reduce the output rate of the data, passed to it from level-1, by two orders of magnitude. Within regions of interest defined by the level-1 trigger, full granularity of the detector is accessible. The efficiency of the level-2 triggers for prompt \(J/\psi\) events is plotted in Figure 4 as a function of di-muon \(p_{T}\). The total level-2 trigger efficiency in the reconstructed prompt \(J/\psi\) events (relative to level-1) is 97%. The di-muon trigger scenario \(\mu 6\mu 4\), considered in the majority of this note, uses all the above trigger signatures.

#### 2.1.1 Effect of di-muon trigger cuts on quarkonium rates

Figures 5(a) and 5(b) illustrate the distribution of cross-sections across the values of the \(p_{T}\) of the harder and softer muon from the quarkonium decay without any muon cuts applied at generator level. The lines overlaid on the plots represent various nominal muon \(p_{T}\) thresholds: (6 GeV, 4 GeV) and (4 GeV, 4 GeV), as well as the nominal thresholds (10 GeV, 0.5 GeV) corresponding to the single muon trigger \(\mu 10\) (see below).

For \(J/\psi\) the bulk of the cross-section lies near the (4 GeV, 1 GeV) region, far from the low-\(p_{T}\) muon trigger thresholds proposed for ATLAS, and we see only a small increase in accessible cross-section by lowering the cut on the harder muon from 6 GeV to 4 GeV (although this reduction in the effective \(J/\psi\)\(p_{T}\) threshold is useful from a physics standpoint). The situation for \(\Upsilon\) is significantly different

Figure 3: Efficiency of various level-1 triggers for prompt \(J/\psi\) events versus \(p_{T}\) of the di-muon system. Only the triggers with efficiencies greater than 2% in some region of \(p_{T}\) are displayed. The relevant triggers are the single muon \(p_{T}\) threshold triggers labelled L1_MUXX (where XX indicates the \(p_{T}\) threshold in GeV) and the di-muon trigger L1_2MU06. Each \(p_{T}\) range of these triggers is exclusive. The efficiency curve labelled LVL1_Muon is the sum of all level-1 single muon efficiencies (excluding the di-muon trigger L1_2MU06).

however, as the relatively large mass of the \(\Upsilon\) shifts the bulk of the production to the region near muon \(p_{T}\) thresholds of (5 GeV, 4 GeV). This means that by lowering the di-muon trigger cuts from (6 GeV, 4 GeV), which sits just above the highest density area of \(\Upsilon\) production, to (4 GeV, 4 GeV), a much higher fraction of the produced \(\Upsilon\) can be recorded, leading to a predicted order-of-magnitude increase in the accessible cross-section. The predicted cross-sections for the processes \(pp\to J/\psi(\mu^{+}\mu^{-})X\) and \(pp\to\Upsilon(\mu^{+}\mu^{-})X\) (before incorporating trigger and reconstruction efficiencies) for a number of trigger scenarios are presented in Table 1. Although no higher \(\psi\) and \(\Upsilon\) states have been simulated for this analysis, their expected cross-sections are also shown in Table 1, as estimated using Tevatron results on their relative yields [12]. Numbers include feed-down from \(\chi\) states and higher radial excitations to lower ones. Due to the expected ATLAS mass resolution for the \(\Upsilon\) states, however, it is unlikely that the higher state resonances will be separable. These predictions have been obtained by extrapolating the Colour Octet Model, tuned to describe the Tevatron results, to the LHC energy. Although every care have been taken to ensure stability of this extrapolation, inevitably there is an uncertainty in the overall scale of the predicted cross-sections (linked to the uncertainties in the parton distribution functions at small \(x\)), which we estimate at the level of \(\pm 50\%\).

It is likely that the cross-section accessible by ATLAS will be higher than the values quoted in Table 1, as during early running the low \(p_{T}\) muon trigger will run with an open coincidence window in \(\eta\) at level-1 and no requirement of an additional level-2 di-muon trigger. This trigger item has a turn-on threshold at around 4 GeV, giving the (4 GeV, 4 GeV) trigger scenario described above, but in practice there is a non-zero trigger efficiency below 4 GeV, which, combined with the large rate of low \(p_{T}\) onia, may add a significant extra contribution to the overall observed cross-section. Even including this contribution, the overall rate of signal events from all quarkonium states is likely to remain below the

Only the triggers with efficiencies greater than 2% in some region of \(p_{T}\) are displayed. The level-2 trigger signatures of interest include single muon \(p_{T}\) threshold triggers L2_MUX and ‘TrigDiMuon’ triggers L2_BJpsimuXmuY which are specialised for searching for \(J/\psi\)[11]. The efficiency curve labelled LVL2_Pass in (b) is the sum of all level-2 efficiencies.

rate of 1 Hz at a luminosity of \(10^{31}\) cm\({}^{-2}\)s\({}^{-1}\), which is a small fraction of the available trigger bandwidth.

#### 2.1.2 Effect of trigger cuts on analysis of octet states

As discussed above, the quarkonium cross-section is composed of three main classes of processes: direct colour singlet production, colour octet production and singlet/octet production of \(\chi\) states. Figure 6 illustrates the contributions of these three classes to the overall production rate for \(\Upsilon\), once the \(p_{T}\) trigger cuts of 6 and 4 are applied to the muons. Lower \(p_{T}\) trigger cuts will strongly enhance the \(\Upsilon\) rate and allow for analysis of colour singlet production, which is expected to dominate for \(\Upsilon\) with \(p_{T}<10\) GeV.

The last column shows the overlap between the di-muon and single muon samples.

No cut was placed on the generated sample. The overlaid lines represent the nominal thresholds of observed events with various trigger cuts applied: \(\mu 6\mu 4\) (solid line), \(\mu 4\mu 4\) (dashed line) and \(\mu 10+\)track (dash-dotted line).

Lower trigger cuts available during early running, such as the \(\mu 4\mu 4\) trigger described above, will allow the opportunity to extend the low-\(p_{T}\) region down to \(p_{T}\simeq 0\) in the case of \(\Upsilon\) and help separate octet and singlet contributions.

#### 2.1.3 Acceptance of \(\cos\theta^{*}\) with di-muon triggers

An important consideration for calculating the di-muon trigger efficiencies of \(J/\psi\) and \(\Upsilon\) is the angular distribution of the decay angle \(\theta^{*}\), the angle between the direction of the positive muon (by convention) from quarkonium decay in the quarkonium rest frame and the flight direction of the quarkonium itself in the laboratory frame (Figure 7).

The distribution in \(\cos\theta^{*}\) may depend on the relative contributions of the various production mechanisms, and is as of yet not fully understood. Crucially, Monte Carlo studies have shown that different production mechanisms (and thus different angular distributions) can have significantly different trigger acceptances, and without the measurement of the spin-alignment of quarkonium it will be difficult to be sure that the full trigger efficiency has been calculated correctly.

It is clear that \(\cos\theta^{*}\simeq 0\) corresponds to events with both muons having roughly equal transverse momenta, while in order to have \(\cos\theta^{*}\) close to \(\pm 1\) one muon's \(p_{T}\) needs to be very high while the other's \(p_{T}\) is very low. In the case of a di-muon trigger, both muons from the \(J/\psi\) and \(\Upsilon\) decays must have relatively large transverse momenta. Whilst this condition allows both muons to be identified, it also severely restricts acceptance in the polarisation angle \(\cos\theta^{*}\), meaning that for a given \(p_{T}\) of \(J/\psi\) or \(\Upsilon\) a significant fraction of the total cross-section is lost.

Figure 6: Expected \(p_{T}\)-distribution for \(\Upsilon\) production, with contributions from direct colour singlet, singlet \(\chi\) production and octet production overlaid.

Figure 7: Graphical representation of the \(\theta^{*}\) angle used in the spin alignment analysis. The angle is defined by the direction of the positive muon in the quarkonium decay frame and the quarkonium momentum direction in the laboratory frame.

Examples of the polarisation angle distributions for the \(\mu 6\mu 4\) trigger are shown by solid lines in Figure 8. Here, the samples for both \(J/\psi\) and \(\Upsilon\) were generated with zero polarisation, so with full acceptance the corresponding distribution in \(\cos\theta^{*}\) should be flat, spanning from \(-1\) to \(+1\).

Clearly, narrow acceptance in \(|\cos\theta^{*}|\) would make polarisation measurements difficult.

### Single muon trigger

Another possibility for quarkonium reconstruction is to trigger on a single identified muon. The non-prescaled level-1 single muon trigger L1_MU10 with a 10 GeV\(p_{T}\) threshold is expected to produce manageable event rates at low luminosities [11]. Once this muon triggers the event, offline analysis can reconstruct the quarkonium by combining the identified muon with an oppositely-charged track in the event. In Figure 5 this trigger corresponds to the dash-dotted lines, with the predicted cross-sections also shown in Table 1. With this trigger (referred to as \(\mu 10\) in the following) one removes the need for the other muon to have a large \(p_{T}\), i.e. one has a fast muon, which triggered the event, and one track, whose transverse momentum is only limited by the track reconstruction capabilities of ATLAS, with the threshold around 0.5 GeV.

Thus, the onium events with a single muon trigger typically have much higher values of \(|\cos\theta^{*}|\), as illustrated by the dotted lines in Figure 8, complementing the di-muon trigger sample. So, the single- and di-muon samples may be used together to provide excellent coverage across almost the entire range of \(\cos\theta^{*}\) in the same \(p_{T}\) range of onia.

It's worth noting that the di-muon and single muon samples have comparable cross-sections and similar \(p_{T}\) dependence. They are not entirely independent: at high transverse momenta the two samples have significant event overlap (see Table 1 for more details), which could be useful for independent calibration of muon trigger and reconstruction efficiencies.

The distributions are normalised to unit area. The generated angular distribution is flat in both cases.

Reconstruction and background suppression

### Quarkonium reconstruction with two muon candidates

In each event which passes the di-muon trigger, all reconstructed muon candidates are combined into oppositely charged pairs, and each of these pairs is analysed in turn. The invariant mass is calculated and, if the mass is above 1 GeV, the two tracks are refitted to a common vertex. If a good vertex fit is achieved, the pair is accepted for further analysis. If the invariant mass of the refitted tracks is within 300 MeV of the nominal mass in the case of \(J/\psi\), or 1 GeV in the case of \(\Upsilon\), the pair is considered as a quarkonium candidate. The values quoted by the Particle Data Group [13], 3097 MeV and 9460 MeV for \(J/\psi\) and \(\Upsilon\) respectively, are used throughout this paper, and the widths of the mass windows are chosen to be about six times the expected average mass resolution (see Table 2).

For those pairs for which the vertex fit is successful (more than 99% for both \(J/\psi\)  and \(\Upsilon\) ), the invariant mass is recalculated. The invariant mass resolution depends on the pseudorapidities of the two muon tracks. To illustrate this effect, all accepted onia candidates are divided into three classes depending on \(\eta\) of the muons, and Gaussian fits are performed to determine the resolutions and mass shifts. The results are presented in Table 2.

It is found that the mass resolution is the highest when both tracks are reconstructed in the barrel area, \(|\eta|<1.05\), degrades somewhat if both tracks are reconstructed in the endcap regions, \(|\eta|>1.05\), and is close to its average value for the mixed \(\eta\) events, with one muon in the barrel and the other in the endcap. It should be noted that no significant non-gaussian tails are observed in either of these mass distributions, and the fit quality is good. Also shown in the table are the shifts of the mean reconstructed invariant mass from the respective nominal values. The observed mass shifts are due to a problem with simulation of material effects in the endcap, which has since been understood and corrected.

The reconstructed muon pairs that remain after vertexing cuts are considered to be good quarkonium candidates, and further analysis is done using these pairs only. The transverse momentum distributions of these candidates are shown in Figure 9.

As can be seen from the Figure 9(a), prompt \(J/\psi\)  are mainly selected with \(p_{T}\) above around 10 GeV, due to the di-muon trigger cuts applied to the events. The decay kinematics of \(\Upsilon\)  is somewhat different due to its larger mass, thus allowing \(\Upsilon\)  to be selected with \(p_{T}\) as low as 4 GeV. Even at these, relatively low, statistics one expects to see significant numbers of both types of quarkonia at large \(p_{T}\), which will allow statistically significant high-\(p_{T}\)  analyses beyond the reach of the Tevatron.

Figure 10(a) presents the \(J/\psi\)  acceptance as a function of the \(J/\psi\)  transverse momentum, relative to the Monte Carlo generated dataset, which requires the two muons to be within \(|\eta|<2.5\) and have transverse momenta greater than 6 and 4 GeV, respectively. Geometric acceptance of the detector and reconstruction efficiency losses due to vertexing, as well as trigger efficiencies have been taken into account. When \(J/\psi\)  are produced with a transverse momentum above 10 GeV, we see a sharp rise in the acceptance as \(J/\psi\)  above this threshold are able to satisfy the muon trigger requirements within a certain kinematic configuration.

\end{table}

The structure in the plot of the \(\eta\)-dependence of \(J/\psi\) reconstruction efficiency, shown in Figure 10(b), highlights the configuration necessary in order for muons from the \(J/\psi\) to be able to pass the di-muon trigger, described below. The distribution of reconstructed quarkonium candidates with the angular separation of the two muons, described by the variable \(\Delta R=\sqrt{\Delta\phi^{2}+\Delta\eta^{2}}\), is shown in Figure 11. On average, muons from reconstructed \(J/\psi\) (\(\mu 6\mu 4\)) candidates are separated by \(\Delta R\simeq 0.47\), and are restricted from being detected with separations larger than around 0.7.

In comparison, the higher mass of \(\Upsilon\) requires the muons in the \(\mu 6\mu 4\) case to have a much larger opening angle, with a broad distribution in \(\Delta R\) peaking at around 1.8 and spanning up to 2.6. One can see that for the single \(\mu 10\) case in Figure 11(b) the distributions are much broader, and generally with smaller separation in \(\Delta R\), reflecting the lower \(p_{T}\) constraint on the second muon.

The small separation of muons in \(\Delta R\) for the \(J/\psi\) (\(\mu 6\mu 4\)) case has consequences for the \(J/\psi\) reconstruction efficiency as a function of pseudorapidity, shown in Figure 10(b). Significant dips in efficiency are seen near \(\eta\pm 1.2\) and \(\eta=0\), due to the muon spectrometer layout [14]. As the muons from \(J/\psi\) are on average separated by only \(\Delta R=0.47\), they are subject to similar material and detector effects, and so these effects are carried over into the \(J/\psi\) reconstruction with very little smearing. Hence, this distribution has a similar shape to the individual muon reconstruction efficiency distribution in ATLAS.

This contrasts with the \(\Upsilon\) reconstruction efficiency dependence on pseudorapidity, shown in Figure 12(b), which is much smoother than in \(J/\psi\) case: the two muons have large angular separation and the detector layout effects are smeared over a broader range of \(\eta\) values. Figure 12(a) shows the variation of acceptance with the \(\Upsilon\) transverse momentum, and reflects the fact that with the \(\mu 6\mu 4\) trigger \(\Upsilon\) can be reconstructed with a lower \(p_{T}\) threshold. In the absence of a dedicated topological trigger for \(\Upsilon\), trigger efficiency at low \(p_{T}\) suffers due to the differing decay kinematics between \(J/\psi\) and \(\Upsilon\) as only specialised \(J/\psi\) triggers exist in reconstruction software used in this analysis. At larger \(p_{T}\) both acceptances reach a plateau at around 80-85%.

Statistics shown in the figures correspond to integrated luminosities of about 6 pb\({}^{-1}\) and 10 pb\({}^{-1}\) for \(J/\psi\) and \(\Upsilon\), respectively.

### Offline monitoring using quarkonium

The di-muon decays of \(J/\psi\) and \(\Upsilon\) will be used in both online and offline monitoring at ATLAS. Mass shifts for the reconstructed quarkonium states, plotted versus a number of different variables, have been proposed to monitor detector alignment, material effects, magnetic field scale and its stability, as well as to provide checks of muon reconstruction algorithm performance. The CDF collaboration extensively and successfully used this method, although it took many years at the Tevatron to collect sufficient statistics to allow for the disentanglement of various detector effects [15].

The expected rate of quarkonium production at ATLAS is such that we can expect to be able to perform meaningful monitoring and corrections online. There are many examples of where monitoring of quarkonium mass shifts can be useful in data-taking. Mass shifts in quarkonia as a function of transverse momentum can reveal problems with energy loss corrections and the muon momentum scale. As a function of pseudorapidity this can be a good probe of over- or under-correction of material effects in the simulated detector geometry and of magnetic field uniformity. \(J/\psi\) mass shifts in Monte Carlo simulations have already helped to improve muon reconstruction algorithms in ATLAS.

An example of a reconstructed \(J/\psi\) mass shift measurement at ATLAS with the statistics corresponding to 6 pb\({}^{-1}\) is presented in Figure 13. This is the dependence of \(\Delta M\) on the difference in curvatures of positive and negative muons, which allows for checks of a potentially important effect seen at CDF: horizontal misalignments in some detector elements may result in a constant curvature offset that can lead to significant charge-dependent tracking effects. A misalignment may be such that a negative track has a higher assigned curvature (and hence lower momentum) than is truly the case, whilst a positive track would be affected in the opposite way. The sample shown in the figure is simulated with ideal geometry and does not show any significant effects of this kind.

For detector alignment and data monitoring purposes, quarkonium provides a low \(p_{T}\) point for calibration, complementary to the \(Z\) boson sample, and allows for the possibility to identify any systematic variations that may develop at higher \(p_{T}\).

In order to be able to analyse mass shifts due to two-variable correlations and disentangle various detector effects, significant statistics of \(J/\psi\) and \(\Upsilon\) di-muon decays have to be accumulated. A dedicated study is being performed in ATLAS to optimise the strategy of real time and offline monitoring using

Figure 10: Acceptance of reconstructed prompt \(J/\psi\) as a function of \(J/\psi\) transverse momentum and pseudorapidity (relative to the MC generated dataset with \(\mu 6\mu 4\) cuts).

### Background suppression in di-muon case

The expected sources of background for prompt quarkonium with a di-muon \(\mu 6\mu 4\) trigger are:

* indirect \(J/\psi\) production from \(b\bar{b}\) events;
* continuum of muon pairs from \(b\bar{b}\) events;
* continuum of muon pairs from charm decays;
* di-muon production via the Drell-Yan process;
* decays in flight of \(\pi^{\pm}\) and \(K^{\pm}\) mesons.

The most important background contributions are expected to come from the decays \(b\to J/\psi+X\), and the continuum of di-muons from \(b\bar{b}\) events. Both of these have been simulated and analysed. The estimated total contribution from charm decays is higher than that from \(b\bar{b}\) events. However, this background has not been simulated, as it is not expected to cause problems for prompt quarkonium reconstruction because the transverse momentum spectrum of the muons falls very steeply and the probability of producing a di-muon with an invariant mass within the range of interest is well below the level expected from \(b\bar{b}\) events. Only a small fraction of the Drell-Yan pairs survive the di-muon trigger cuts of \(\mu 6\mu 4\) in the \(J/\psi-\Upsilon\) mass range, which makes this background essentially negligible, as estimated from generator-level simulation. Muons from decays in flight also have a steeply falling muon momentum spectrum, and in addition require random coincidences with muons from other sources in the quarkonium invariant mass range. This is estimated to be at the level of a few percent of the signal rate, spread over a continuum of invariant masses.

All background di-muon sources mentioned above, apart from Drell-Yan pairs, contain muons which originate from secondary vertices, which makes it possible to suppress these backgrounds by removing such di-muons whenever a secondary vertex has been resolved, based on the pseudo-proper time

Figure 11: Distribution of \(\Delta R\) separation of the two muons from \(J/\psi\) and \(\Upsilon\) candidates with di-muon \(\mu 6\mu 4\) generator-level cuts (left) and single muon \(\mu 10\) cuts (right) applied.

measurement. The pseudo-proper time is defined as

\[\text{Pseudo-proper time}=\frac{L_{xy}\cdot M_{J/\psi}}{p_{T}(J/\psi)\cdot c}, \tag{1}\]

where \(M_{J/\psi}\) and \(p_{T}(J/\psi)\) represent the mass and the transverse momentum of the \(J/\psi\) candidate, \(c\) is the speed of light in vacuum, and \(L_{xy}\) is the measured radial displacement of the two-track vertex from the beamline. Once the two muons forming a \(J/\psi\) candidate are reconstructed, the pseudo-proper time is used to distinguish between the prompt \(J/\psi\), which have a pseudo-proper time of zero, and \(J/\psi\) coming from \(B\)-hadron decays and hence having an exponentially decaying pseudo-proper time distribution, due to the non-zero lifetime of the parent B-hadrons.

The dependence of the resolution in radial decay length \(L_{xy}\) on di-muon pseudorapidity \(\eta\) is shown in Figure 14, while the variation of the expected resolution in the pseudo-proper time with di-muon \(p_{T}\) is shown in Table 3.

An improvement in the resolution is seen with increasing \(p_{T}\) of the \(J/\psi\) and decreasing \(|\eta|\). Here a perfect detector alignment is assumed, with the resulting average resolution estimated at around 0.1 ps.

Figure 15(a) illustrates the pseudo-proper time distribution for both the prompt and indirect \(J/\psi\) samples. By making a cut on the pseudo-proper time, one can efficiently separate most of the indirect \(J/\psi\) from a prompt \(J/\psi\) sample (or vice-versa). The efficiency and purity of the pseudo-proper time cuts for prompt \(J/\psi\) are presented in Figure 15(b). A pseudo-proper time cut of less than 0.2 ps allows to

retain prompt \(J/\psi\) with the efficiency of 93% and the purity of 92%. Note that the distribution shown in Figure 15(a) is, in a sense, self-calibrating: the part to the left of the maximum can be used to determine the resolution \(\sigma\), and an appropriate cut of \(2\sigma\) can be applied to remove the 'tail' of secondary \(J/\psi\) candidates on the right hand side.

The background levels of beauty and Drell-Yan production under the \(\Upsilon\) peak are similar to those for the \(J/\psi\), except that here one does not have to contend with sources of non-prompt quarkonia from \(B\)-decays. However, the \(bb\to\mu 6\mu 4\) background continuum under the \(\Upsilon\) is more problematic: higher invariant masses around the \(\Upsilon\) mean that the two triggered muons will necessarily come from two separate decays, meaning that the pseudo-proper time cut is far less effective.

Fortunately, flags associated to individual reconstructed muon tracks provide further vertexing information, which could be used for suppressing of the \(bb\to\mu 6\mu 4\) continuum background. Reconstructed tracks are assigned to either come from the primary vertex, a secondary vertex, or are left undetermined. By requiring that both of the muons combined to make a \(J/\psi\) or a \(\Upsilon\) candidate are determined to have come from the primary vertex, background from the \(bb\to\mu 6\mu 4\) continuum can be reduced by a factor of three or more, whilst reducing the number of signal events by around 5% in both cases.

Figure 16 illustrates the quarkonium signal and main background invariant mass distributions in the mass range \(2-12\) GeV, for those events which satisfy the \(\mu 6\mu 4\) trigger requirements, with reconstruction

efficiencies and background suppression cuts taken into account. Peaks from the \(J/\psi\) and \(\Upsilon(1\mathrm{S})\) clearly dominate the background. As no higher \(\psi\) and \(\Upsilon\) states were simulated for this analysis, their peaks are not shown. The dotted line indicates the level of the background continuum before the vertexing cuts.

In conclusion, we find that the level of the backgrounds considered for both \(J/\psi\) and \(\Upsilon\) do not represent any serious problem for reconstruction and analysis of direct quarkonia with the di-muon \(\mu 6\mu 4\) trigger.

### Reconstruction and background suppression with a single muon candidate

By using the \(\mu 10\) trigger, one selects events with at least one identified muon candidate with \(p_{T}\) above 10 GeV. In this part of the analysis, each reconstructed single muon candidate is combined with oppositely-charged tracks reconstructed in the same event. For both \(J/\psi\) and \(\Upsilon\) reconstruction, we insist that any other reconstructed track to be combined with the identified trigger muon has an opposite electric charge and is within a cone of \(\Delta R=3.0\) around the muon direction, so as to retain over 99% (91%) of the signal events in the \(J/\psi\) (\(\Upsilon\)) case. As in the di-muon analysis, we require that both the identified muon and the track are flagged as having come from the primary vertex. In addition, we impose a cut on the transverse impact parameter \(d_{0}\), \(|d_{0}|<0.04\) mm on the muon and \(|d_{0}|<0.10\) mm on the track, in order to further suppress the number of background pairs from \(B\)-decays.

The invariant mass distribution for the remaining pairings of a muon and a track is shown in Figure 17(a) for \(J/\psi\) with \(p_{T}\) larger than 9 GeV and in Figure 17(b) for \(J/\psi\) with \(p_{T}\) larger than 17 GeV. The distributions are fitted using a single gaussian for the signal and a straight line for the background. Clear \(J/\psi\) peaks can be seen, with statistically insignificant mass shifts and the resolution close to that in the di-muon sample. It's worth noting that the signal-to-background ratio around the \(J/\psi\) peak improves slightly with increasing transverse momentum of \(J/\psi\). At higher \(p_{T}\) the \(\cos\theta^{*}\) acceptance also becomes broader, which should help independent polarisation measurements.

For \(\Upsilon\) the situation is less favourable, due to the combination of a lower signal cross-section and

Figure 15: (a) Pseudo-proper time distribution for reconstructed prompt \(J/\psi\) (dark shading) and the sum of prompt and indirect \(J/\psi\) candidates (lighter shading). (b) Efficiency (solid line) and purity (dotted line) for prompt \(J/\psi\) candidates as a function of the pseudo-proper time cut. Statistics correspond to the integrated luminosity of 6 pb\({}^{-1}\).

a higher background. Although the \(\Upsilon\) peak can be seen above the smooth background, its statistical significance is rather low. Hence, with this statistics, the use of the single muon sample for \(\Upsilon\) cannot be justified, and in the following we will only rely on the di-muon sample.

In conclusion, we expect that the single muon trigger with a 10 GeV threshold can be successfully used to select prompt \(J/\psi\) events. The expected background here, although much larger than in di-muon case, is well under control. For \(\Upsilon\) however, the single muon sample is only likely to be useful at significantly higher statistics and higher transverse momenta.

### Summary of cuts and efficiencies

Table 4 summarises the efficiencies of all the selection and background suppression cuts described above, for both the di-muon and single muon trigger samples. Not all cuts are applicable to all samples; those which are not are labelled accordingly. Numbers in italics are estimates in cases where no adequate fully simulated sample was available. The efficiencies for \(\mu 6\mu 4\) samples are calculated relative to the Monte Carlo sample with generator-level cuts on the two highest muon transverse momenta of 6 and 4 GeV. For the \(\mu 10\) samples, the generator-level cut of 10 GeV was applied to the \(p_{T}\) of the highest-\(p_{T}\) muon. Expected yields \(N_{S}\) of quarkonia for 10 pb\({}^{-1}\) are given at the bottom of the table, along with background yields \(N_{B}\) within the invariant mass window of \(\pm 300\) MeV for \(J/\psi\) and \(\pm 1\) GeV for \(\Upsilon\), and the signal-to-background ratios at respective \(J/\psi\) and \(\Upsilon\) peaks for each sample.

For higher, excited quarkonium states with vector quantum numbers the efficiencies are expected to be similar, but not necessarily identical. The biggest differences are expected for \(\psi^{\prime}\), where the production mechanisms as well as decay kinematics are significantly different.

## 4 Polarisation and cross-section measurement

The Colour Octet Model predicts that prompt quarkonia produced in \(pp\) collisions are transversely polarised, with the degree of polarisation increasing as a function of the transverse momentum. Other

Figure 16: The cumulative plot of the invariant mass of di-muons from various sources, reconstructed with a \(\mu 6\mu 4\) trigger, with the requirement that both muons are identified as coming from the primary vertex and with a pseudo-proper time cut of 0.2 ps. The dotted line shows the cumulative distribution without vertex and pseudo-proper time cuts.

production models predict different \(p_{T}\) dependencies of the polarisation and so this quantity serves as an important measurement for discrimination of these models (see Figure 1(b)).

Quarkonium polarisation can be assessed by measuring the angular distribution of the muons produced in the decay. The relevant decay angle \(\theta^{*}\) is defined in Figure 7. The spin alignment of the parent vector quarkonium state can be determined by measuring the polarisation parameter \(\alpha\) in the distribution

\[\frac{dN}{d\cos\theta^{*}}=C\,\frac{3}{2\alpha+6}\left(1+\alpha\cos^{2}\theta ^{*}\right). \tag{2}\]

The choice of parameters in Equation 2 is such that the distribution is normalised to \(C\). The parameter \(\alpha\), defined as \(\alpha=(\sigma_{T}-2\sigma_{L})/(\sigma_{T}+2\sigma_{L})\), is equal to \(+1\) for transversely polarised production (helicity \(=\pm 1\)). For a longitudinal polarisation (helicity \(=0\)), \(\alpha\) is equal to \(-1\). Unpolarised production consists of equal fractions of helicity states \(+1\), \(0\) and \(-1\), and corresponds to \(\alpha=0\).

The difficulty of quarkonium polarisation measurements is evidenced by the discrepancies between \(\mathrm{D}\mathcal{O}\)  and CDF results shown in Figure 1(b). The problem can be traced to the limited acceptance at high \(|\cos\theta^{*}|\), and hence difficulties in separating acceptance corrections from spin alignment effects (see, e.g., [7]).

Note that the feed-down from \(\chi\) state and \(b\)-hadron decays may lead to a different spin alignment and hence to a possible effective depolarisation which is hard to estimate. In addition, due to the limited statistics, the polarisation measurements at the Tevatron cannot reach the region of high \(p_{T}\), where theoretical uncertainties are expected to be smaller.

At ATLAS we aim to measure the polarisation of prompt vector quarkonium states, in the transverse momentum range up to \(\sim 50\) GeV and beyond, with extended coverage in \(\cos\theta^{*}\) which will allow for

Figure 17: Prompt quarkonium signal and \(bb\to\mu X\) background events selected with the \(\mu 10\) trigger, in the mass range around \(J/\psi\)  with (a) \(p_{T}\) above 9 GeV, and (b) \(p_{T}\) above 17 GeV, corresponding to 10 pb\({}^{-1}\) of data. The background from \(B\) decays is shown in light grey. Cuts described in the text have been applied. The distributions were fitted using the sum of a linear background and a gaussian peak centered at \(M=3097\) MeV \(+\Delta M\) with resolution \(\sigma\).

improved understanding of efficiency measurements and thus reduced systematics. The promptly produced \(J/\psi\) mesons and those that originated from \(B\)-hadron decays can be separated using the displaced decay vertices, as explained above. With a high production rate of quarkonia at LHC, it will be possible to achieve a higher degree of purity of prompt \(J/\psi\) in the analysed sample and reduce the depolarising effect from \(B\)-decays, whilst retaining high statistics.

As explained in Section 2.1.3, with the di-muon trigger signature such as \(\mu 6\mu 4\), the acceptance at large values of \(|\cos\theta^{*}|\) (where the difference between various polarisation states is the biggest) is strongly reduced, especially at low transverse momenta of quarkonium. The kinematic acceptance \({\cal A}(p_{T},\cos\theta^{*})\) of the \(\mu 6\mu 4\) cuts applied at generator level, with respect to the full generator-level sample with no cuts on muon transverse momenta, is shown by the solid lines in Figure 18 for various \(p_{T}\) slices of \(J/\psi\). The acceptance is seen to be quite low at \(J/\psi\)\(p_{T}\) below 12 GeV, but in higher \(p_{T}\) slices there is an area in the middle of \(\cos\theta^{*}\) range with essentially 100% acceptance, which becomes broader with increasing \(p_{T}\) of the \(J/\psi\), but does not go beyond \(|\cos\theta^{*}|\simeq 0.5\).

The acceptance for the single muon trigger sample, shown with the dashed lines in Figure 18, is different: here the areas of 100% acceptance are at high \(|\cos\theta^{*}|\), and the dip in the middle gradually fills up with increasing \(p_{T}\). This sample essentially has a full acceptance at \(p_{T}>20\) GeV, apart from the drop at \(|\cos\theta^{*}|>0.95\) due to the cut of 0.5 GeV on the \(p_{T}\) of the track of the second muon.

The plots in Figure 18 were obtained using a dedicated generator-level Monte Carlo sample. The error bars shown in the figure reflect both statistical errors and the uncertainties due to possible dependence on \(\eta\) coverage.

The simulated 'raw' measured distributions \(dN^{\rm raw}/d\cos\theta^{*}\), for the same slices of \(J/\psi\) transverse momenta, are shown in Figure 19. Again, solid and dashed lines represent the events selected by the di-muon \(\mu 6\mu 4\) and the single muon \(\mu 10\) triggers, respectively. The sample was generated with zero polarisation. The raw numbers of measured events in the \(\mu 10\) sample were obtained by fitting the invari

ant mass distributions with a gaussian peak and a linear background, for each bin of \(\cos\theta^{*}\) in each \(p_{T}\) slice. With the estimated signal-to-background ratios shown in Figure 17(a), this causes an increase in the statistical errors, typically by a factor of 2.

The corrected distributions \(dN^{\rm cor}/d\cos\theta^{*}\) are calculated according to the following formula:

\[\frac{dN^{\rm cor}}{d\cos\theta^{*}}=\frac{1}{\mathcal{A}(p_{T},\cos\theta^{*} )\cdot\varepsilon_{1}\cdot\varepsilon_{2}}\cdot\,\frac{dN^{\rm raw}}{d\cos \theta^{*}} \tag{3}\]

Here \(\varepsilon_{1}\) stands for the trigger and reconstruction efficiency, while \(\varepsilon_{2}\) denotes the efficiency of background suppression cuts for each sample, as defined in Table 4. Their values have been averaged over the accessible phase space within the relevant \(p_{T}\) slice. Studies have shown that while \(\varepsilon_{1}\) depend on \(p_{T}\) (cf. Figure 10(a)), \(\varepsilon_{2}\) remain essentially constant over the phase space of interest. The efficiencies \(\varepsilon_{1}\) and \(\varepsilon_{2}\) for both samples are listed in Table 5, while the acceptances \(\mathcal{A}(p_{T},\cos\theta^{*})\) are shown in Figure 18.

Table 5: Efficiencies for the \(\mu 6\mu 4\) and \(\mu 10\) samples, averaged over each of the six \(p_{T}\) slices.

At high \(p_{T}\) the two samples increasingly overlap, thus allowing for a cross-check of acceptance and efficiency corrections. However, for measurement purposes the \(\mu 6\mu 4\) samples are used whenever possible, complemented by \(\mu 10\) samples at high \(\cos\theta^{*}\). In order to achieve this, the distributions shown in Figure 19 were appropriately masked and combined. The combined distributions \(dN^{\rm cor}/d\cos\theta^{*}\), corrected according to Equation 3, are shown in Figure 20. The errors shown in the plots include the statistical errors on the raw data, as well as the uncertainties on the acceptance and efficiencies. These \(\cos\theta^{*}\) distributions are fitted using the Equation 2, with \(\alpha\) and \(C\) as free parameters for each \(p_{T}\) slice. The fit results are presented in Table 6, with constant \(C\) rescaled to the measured cross-section \(\sigma\), corresponding to the integrated luminosity of 10 pb\({}^{-1}\).

To further check our ability to measure the spin alignment of \(J/\psi\), the raw distributions shown in Figure 19 were reweighted to emulate transversely polarised (\(\alpha_{\rm gen}=+1\)) and longitudinally polarised (\(\alpha_{\rm gen}=-1\)) \(J/\psi\) samples, and the analysis described above was repeated. The results are shown in Figure 21 and in the middle two sections of Table 6.

A similar analysis can be done for measuring the polarisation and cross-section of \(\Upsilon\), but at the integrated luminosity of 10 pb\({}^{-1}\) these measurements are expected to be far less precise than in \(J/\psi\) case. The main reasons are lower \(\Upsilon\) cross-sections at high transverse momenta, and higher backgrounds for the \(\mu 10\) sample. The latter reason, as explained in Section 3.4, means that with these statistics the \(\mu 10\) sample is essentially unusable, and the limited acceptance of the \(\mu 6\mu 4\) sample at high \(|\cos\theta^{*}|\) makes a precise measurement difficult.

The corrected \(|\cos\theta^{*}|\) distributions for unpolarised \(\Upsilon\)  from the \(\mu 6\mu 4\) sample are shown in Figure 22. The results of the fit using Equation 2, with normalisation matched to the integrated luminosity of 10 pb\({}^{-1}\), are shown in the last section of Table 6. With the integrated luminosity increased by an order of magnitude, the \(\mu 10\) sample should become useful and the estimated errors on \(\Upsilon\) polarisation

measurement could be reduced by a factor of 5.

The errors shown in Figures 20 -- 22 and Table 6 include the statistical uncertainties on the measured numbers of events as well as various systematic errors stemming from the uncertainties on acceptances and efficiencies described above.

The overall uncertainty on the integrated luminosity needs to be added to all measured cross-sections, and is expected to be rather large during the initial LHC runs. This uncertainty will not, however, affect the relative magnitudes of the cross-sections measured in separate \(p_{T}\) slices, or the measured values of the polarisation coefficient \(\alpha\). Additional systematic effects have also been studied, such as the influence of finite resolution in \(p_{T}\) and \(\cos\theta^{*}\), changes in binning, details of the functions used for fitting the invariant mass distributions, and variations of cuts used for background suppression. Their respective uncertainties on the measured values of \(\alpha\) and \(\sigma\) have been found not to exceed a small fraction of the quoted errors, and have thus been deemed negligible.

In conclusion, with the integrated luminosity of 10 pb\({}^{-1}\) it should be possible to measure the polarisation of \(J/\psi\)  with the precision of order \(0.02-0.06\), depending on the level of polarisation itself, in a wide range of transverse momenta, \(p_{T}\simeq 10-20\) GeV and beyond. In case of \(\Upsilon\), the expected precision is somewhat lower, of order 0.20. In both cases, however, the \(p_{T}\) dependence of the cross-section should be measured reasonably well.

## 5 Analysis of \(\chi\) production

Quarkonium states with even C parity, such as \(\eta_{c,b}\) and \(\chi_{c,b}\), have a strong coupling to the colour-singlet two-gluon state, and hence a significantly higher production cross-section than vector quarkonia. Their

The lines show the results of the fit using Equation 2, where the fitted values of \(\alpha\) are given in Table 6. Statistics correspond to 10 pb\({}^{-1}\).

dominant production mechanism for the phase space area accessible in ATLAS is via the subprocess shown in Figure 2(b) in Section 1. Their detection, however, is rather more difficult due to the absence of purely leptonic decays.

About 30 to 40% of \(J/\psi\) and \(\Upsilon\) are expected to come from decays \(\chi_{c}\to J/\psi\gamma\) and \(\chi_{b}\to\Upsilon\gamma\). Unfortunately, the energies of the radiated photons tend to be quite small. The ability of ATLAS to detect these photons and resolve various \(\chi\) states is analysed in Section 5.1. Another possibility of observing \(\chi_{b}\) and possibly \(\eta_{b}\) states is considered in Section 5.2, where the reconstruction of these states is attempted through their decay into a pair of \(J/\psi\), both of which subsequently decay into \(\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\).

### Radiative decays of \(\chi_{c},\chi_{b}\) states

Reconstructing \(\chi_{c}\) candidates requires associating a reconstructed \(J/\psi\) with the photon emitted from the \(\chi_{c}\) decay. The transverse momentum distribution for all identified photon candidates in events with a prompt \(J/\psi\), as measured by the ATLAS electromagnetic calorimeter, is shown in Figure 23(a) (light grey histogram).

For \(\chi_{c}\) reconstruction, each selected quarkonium candidate is combined with every reconstructed and identified photon candidate in the event, and the invariant mass of the \(\mu\mu\gamma\) system is calculated. No explicit cut is applied to the \(p_{T}\) of the photon. The \(\mu\mu\gamma\) system is considered to be a \(\chi\) candidate, if the difference \(\Delta M\) between the invariant masses of the \(\mu\mu\gamma\) and \(\mu\mu\) systems lies between 200 and 700 MeV, and the cosine of the opening angle \(\alpha\) between the \(J/\psi\) and \(\gamma\) momenta is larger than 0.97. The last requirement comes from the observation that for the correct \(\mu\mu\gamma\) combinations, the angle \(\alpha\) is usually very small (see reconstructed distribution in Figure 23(b)). By analysing Monte Carlo information, it was found that all photons from generated \(\chi\) decays were found in the peak near \(\cos\alpha=+1\), with the long

tail in the reconstructed distribution representing the combinatorial background. The transverse energy distribution for those photon candidates which satisfy the above requirements is presented in Figure 23(a) by the dark histogram. With these cuts, the combinatorial background is strongly reduced.

Figure 24 shows the distribution in \(\Delta M\) for the selected \(\chi_{c}\) decay candidates. The expected mean positions of the peaks corresponding to \(\chi_{0}\), \(\chi_{1}\) and \(\chi_{2}\) signals (318, 412 and 460 MeV, respectively) are indicated by arrows. The grey histogram shows the contribution from the background process of \(J/\psi\) production from \(B\)-hadron decays, some of which survive the pseudo-proper time cut.

The solid line in Figure 24 is the result of a simultaneous fit to the measured distribution, with the three peak positions fixed at their expected values, and the common resolution function \(\sigma(\Delta M)\). The resolution in \(\sigma(\Delta M)\) is expected to increase with increasing \(\Delta M\), and was empirically parameterised as \(\sigma(\Delta M)=a\cdot\Delta M+b\). The dashed lines show the shapes of individual peaks and of the background continuum. The fit parameters are the heights of the three gaussian peaks \(h_{0},h_{1},h_{2}\), the constants \(a\) and \(b\), and the three parameters describing the smooth polynomial background. The systematic studies include the variation of the background parameterisation and the introduction of a mass shift common for the three resonances. The true amplitudes of the peaks (15, 123 and 87, respectively) are reproduced reasonably well:

\[h_{0} = 15\pm 3(\mathrm{stat.})\pm 10(\mathrm{syst.}),\] \[h_{1} = 101\pm 4(\mathrm{stat.})\pm 12(\mathrm{syst.}), \tag{4}\] \[h_{2} = 103\pm 4(\mathrm{stat.})\pm 9(\mathrm{syst.}),\]

with a strong negative correlation between the last two. The resolution is found to increase from about 35 MeV at \(\chi_{0}\) to about 48 MeV at \(\chi_{2}\), while the overall reconstruction efficiency of \(\chi_{c}\) states is estimated to be about 4%. It may be possible to significantly improve the resolution by using photon conversions, but this is unlikely to yield a big increase in efficiency.

Figure 23: (a) Transverse momentum distribution of photons reconstructed in prompt \(J/\psi\) events. (b) Distribution of \(\cos\alpha\) for each reconstructed \(\gamma\) in an event. On both plots, the light grey (dark grey) histograms show the distributions before (after) the cut on the opening angle \(\alpha\) between the photon and the \(J/\psi\) momentum direction. All photons from \(\chi\to J/\psi\gamma\) decays have \(\cos\alpha>0.97\), while the vast majority of background combinations fall outside the range shown in plot (b). The sample corresponds to the integrated luminosity of 6 pb\({}^{-1}\).

The procedure of reconstructing \(\chi_{b}\) decays into \(\Upsilon+\gamma\) is the same as in the charmonium case, except the di-muon pair is required to be an \(\Upsilon\) candidate. However, the higher di-muon mass and hence smaller expected boost makes the photon much softer and hence more difficult to detect. With the available simulated statistics (50 000 events corresponding to 10 pb\({}^{-1}\)), only 20 \(\chi_{b}\) candidates have been found in the appropriate mass window, which gives an efficiency estimate of 0.03%. In order to reliably observe \(\chi_{b}\rightarrow\Upsilon+\gamma\) decays, an integrated luminosity of at least 1 fb\({}^{-1}\) will be needed.

### Analysis of \(\chi_{b}\to J/\psi d/\psi\)

Another possibility for measuring \(\chi_{b}\) production is through the decay \(\chi_{b}\to J/\psi d/\psi\rightarrow\mu\mu\mu\). The use of this decay for \(\chi_{b}\) detection was proposed in [16], while in [17] the corresponding branching fraction was calculated to be \(Br(\chi_{b0}\to J/\psi\ J/\psi)=2\times 10^{-4}\).

The predicted total inclusive cross-section of \(\chi_{b0}\) production at LHC is estimated at around 1.5 \(\mu\)b [17], yielding the following theoretical estimate (without any momentum cuts on muons):

\[\sigma(pp\rightarrow\chi_{b0}+X)Br(\chi_{b0}\to J/\psi\ J/\psi)=330\,\mbox{pb} \tag{5}\]

We use this cross-section in our study. It should, however, be considered as a lower bound, with higher order QCD corrections expected to increase it significantly, especially within the COM approach. This cross-section also does not include other \(C\)-even states (\(\eta_{b},\chi_{b2}\) and radial excitations), meaning that the overall combined cross-section of resonant \(J/\psi\ J/\psi\) production in the \(\Upsilon\) mass region can be at least an order of magnitude higher.

The Pythia Monte Carlo generator, used to simulate this process, was modified to include this particular decay. Events for this study are triggered with a di-muon trigger \(\mu 6\mu 4\), as for the \(J/\psi\) and \(\Upsilon\) di-muon analysis. Out of 50 000 generated \(\chi_{b}\to J/\psi(\mu\mu)J/\psi(\mu\mu)\) events 815, or 1.6%, passed the \(\mu 6\mu 4\) trigger cuts. Taking into account di-muon branching fractions of the two \(J/\psi\) mesons, this corresponds to the cross-section \(\sigma=20\) fb after trigger.

Figure 24: Difference in invariant masses of \(\mu\mu\gamma\) and \(\mu\mu\) systems in prompt \(J/\psi\) events (light grey) with \(bb\rightarrow\mu 6\mu 4X\) background surviving cuts (dark grey). The arrows represent the true signal peak positions, and the lines show the results of the fit described in the text. Event yields correspond to an integrated luminosity of 10 pb\({}^{-1}\).

The two triggered muons have the highest \(p_{T}\) of the four. The two remaining muons, in many cases, have transverse momenta too low to be identified as muons (i.e. below 2.5 GeV), and sometimes too low to be even reconstructed (below 0.5 GeV).

Two classes of events, remaining after the trigger cuts, have been considered to be useful:

* events where the two trigger muons came from the same \(J/\psi\). Then, the third muon has to be identified by the muon system, while the fourth must at least be reconstructed as a track (124 events);
* events where each trigger muon came from a different \(J/\psi\). The remaining two muons may or may not be identified, but their tracks still need to be reconstructed (330 events).

Thus, taking the trigger, muon identification and track reconstruction efficiencies into account, one expects about 50% of triggered \(\chi_{b}\to J/\psi(\mu\mu)J/\psi(\mu\mu)\) decays to be observed, which amounts to 0.8% of the generated sample, corresponding to the cross-section of 10 fb. Hence, the observed statistics is expected to be around 100 events for the integrated luminosity 10 fb\({}^{-1}\).

Once the two \(J/\psi\) candidates in the event have been reconstructed, a simultaneous fit of the four muon tracks to the common vertex is performed, with \(J/\psi\) mass constraints applied to the respective di-muon invariant masses.

The resulting distribution is presented in Figure 25(a). The resolution on the \(\chi_{b}\) mass is estimated to be as good as 40 MeV. Similar resolution should be expected for the reconstructed invariant mass in the decays of other \(\chi_{bJ}\) states, while the resolution for \(\eta_{b}\to J/\psi(\mu\mu)J/\psi(\mu\mu)\) should be slightly better.

With two pairs of muons in each signal event, there are two possible pairings of oppositely charged muons. The plot of the invariant mass of one di-muon pair versus the invariant mass of the other is shown in Figure 25(b), using generator-level information. All correct pairings, and none of the incorrect pairings of di-muons fall within the circle of radius 200 MeV (about 3-4 \(\sigma\)) from the point with coordinates \(M_{J/\psi},M_{J/\psi}\). The incorrect pairings are scattered over the whole area, so by selecting the pairings from the circle defined above, the combinatorial background can be strongly reduced.

The main expected sources of background to \(\chi_{b}\to J/\psi(\mu\mu)J/\psi(\mu\mu)\) decays are the processes of bottom quark production, \(pp\to b\overline{b}X\), with each \(b\) either decaying into \(J/\psi+X\), or into a muon with

Figure 25: (a) Reconstructed \(\chi_{b}\) invariant mass, with \(J/\psi\) mass constraints applied on the respective di-muon pair masses. (b) Higher di-muon invariant mass plotted versus the lower di-muon invariant mass in \(\chi_{b}\to J/\psi(\mu\mu)J/\psi(\mu\mu)\) events.

additional charged tracks. These backgrounds have been analysed with the same Monte Carlo samples used in our study of backgrounds for single \(J/\psi\)  and \(\Upsilon\)  production. Within the available statistics, very few background events have survived the signal selection cuts described above, and the background suppression cuts on pseudo-proper time on secondary vertices. Extrapolating these results to the integrated luminosity of 10 fb\({}^{-1}\) shows that the statistically significant \(\chi_{b}\to J/\psi(\mu\mu)J/\psi(\mu\mu)\)  signal peak (or peaks) should be visible on top of the combinatorial continuum, with the expected signal-to-background ratio of 10-20% or above.

In short, so far we have seen no major obstacles in an attempt to search for narrow resonances in the \(J/\psi(\mu\mu)J/\psi(\mu\mu)\) invariant mass distributions. However, dedicated high statistics Monte Carlo samples are needed to draw more reliable conclusions.

## 6 Physics reach with early data

During the initial run of the LHC, the integrated luminosity of 1 pb\({}^{-1}\) with the \(\mu 6\mu 4\) trigger would mean about \(15\,000\)\(J/\psi\to\mu\mu\) and \(2\,500\)\(\Upsilon\to\mu\mu\) recorded events. If the \(\mu 4\mu 4\) trigger is used, these numbers would increase up to \(17\,000\) and \(20\,000\) respectively, with these additional events mainly concentrated at the lower end of the quarkonium transverse momenta.

Additional, largely independent statistics will be provided by the \(\mu 10\) trigger: \(16\,000\)\(J/\psi\)  and \(2\,000\)\(\Upsilon\)  with transverse momenta above about 10 GeV, with distributions similar to those from the \(\mu 6\mu 4\) samples. Quite separate from these, another \(7\,000\) of \(J/\psi\)  \(\to\mu\mu\) events are expected from \(b\)-decay events. All these events should be perfectly usable for detector alignment, acceptance and trigger efficiency studies, as well as for understanding tracking and muon system performances.

At the integrated luminosity of about 10 pb\({}^{-1}\) recorded numbers of \(J/\psi\to\mu\mu\) and \(\Upsilon\to\mu\mu\) will be roughly equal to the statistics used in this note. With these statistics, the \(p_{T}\) dependence of the cross-section for both \(J/\psi\)  and \(\Upsilon\)  should be measured reasonably well, in a wide range of transverse momenta, \(p_{T}\simeq 10-50\) GeV. The precision of \(J/\psi\)  polarisation measurement can reach \(0.02-0.06\) (depending on the level of polarisation itself), while the expected error on \(\Upsilon\) polarisation is unlikely to be better than about 0.2. At this stage, first attempts may be made to understand the performance of the electromagnetic calorimetry at low photon energies, and to try and reconstruct \(\chi_{c}\) states from their radiative decays.

With an integrated luminosity of 100 pb\({}^{-1}\), the transverse momentum spectra are expected to reach about 100 GeV and possibly beyond, for both \(J/\psi\)  and \(\Upsilon\). With several million \(J/\psi\to\mu\mu\) and more than 500 000 of \(\Upsilon\to\mu\mu\) decays, and a good understanding of the detector, high precision polarisation measurements, at the level of few percent, should become possible for both \(J/\psi\)  and \(\Upsilon\). \(\chi_{b}\to\Upsilon\gamma\) decays could become observable, while other measurements mentioned above will become increasingly precise.

Further increase of the integrated luminosity should make it possible to observe the resonant production of \(J/\psi\)  meson pairs in the mass range of the \(\Upsilon\)  system. During the future high luminosity running, the need to keep event rates manageable will mean an increase of thresholds of relevant single- and dimuon triggers, and the prescaling of lower threshold triggers. The higher luminosity will further expand the range of reachable transverse momenta and allow further tests of the production mechanisms, as well as make \(\chi_{b}\) reconstruction easier.
