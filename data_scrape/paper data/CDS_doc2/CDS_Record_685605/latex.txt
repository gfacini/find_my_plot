Summary

A discussion is given of the parameter specifications needed to achieve the ATLAS MDT baseline design and a review of the advantages of a central wire support are given. A design for a central wire support system is proposed.

## Introduction

The ATLAS MDT baseline design has no central wire support and requires the longest tubes to be bent in order to roughly follow the wire sagitta. While possessing simplicity in wire support, this design is both complicated and relatively difficult to construct and may be subject to unknown misalignments. An alternative design is to support the wire in the center of long tubes with no wire span longer than 3 meters and to make all the tubes straight. The advantage of this construction is that chambers will operate in any position and are not as sensitive to small misalignments and wire oscillations. In order to realize a central wire support, a viable and economic scheme is needed which both meets the exacting alignment specifications and is practicable to construct.

The merit of the ATLAS MDT baseline design is simplicity of alignment in that only the ends of the tubes have to be located precisely in order to realize a chamber of high precision. By carefully controlling the wire tension, the wires are located correctly, and thus the overall MDT precision is insured. However, a number of practical questions concerning the overall precision and stability of this design arise:

* How large is the wire sagitta?
* How sensitive is the sagitta to wire tension?
* How to stack tubes in order to follow the wire sagitta?
* How sensitive is the design to small misalignments?
* How to build and how to test an MDT?
* Would a central wire support lead to a more robust design?

The intent of this memo is to discuss the pros and cons of the baseline design and to describe some of the merits of using a central wire locator.

Wire Sagitta

Assuming a 50um wire of length L, stretched to a tension of 360 kg with gravity perpendicular to the wire the sagitta is given by:

\[y(x)=\frac{g\rho\sigma}{2T}\left(xL\cdot x^{2}\right) \tag{1a}\] \[y(L/2)=\frac{g\rho\sigma}{8T}L^{2}, \tag{1b}\]

where \(\sigma=\pi\) a\({}^{2}\) is the wire cross section, \(\rho\) is the density and T is the wire tension. Figure 1 shows the catenaries for different scaled wire length. Under these conditions the sagitta for a 6 m wire is about 480 um, but a 3 meter span sags only 120 um.

The sagitta vs. wire length from the equation above scales as the span length L\({}^{2}\) and as 1/T, the wire tension.

The general catenary, where the ends of the wire are at different heights as shown in Fig. 2, is described by the equations below.

Figure 1: Typical wire catenaries are plotted as a function of scaled wire length for horizontal wires. The catenaries (\(y\)-axis) are in microns.

In order to describe the general case we make the following definitions and approximations:

- line geometry spannings ends: \(x\)l = L cos \(\Phi\), yl = L sin \(\Phi\)

- sagitta small: \(\phi\) = \(\Phi\)

- horizontal force: c = T cos \(\phi\) = constant

- weight / length: w = p \(\sigma\) g.

Then the general catenary is given by:

\[y(x)=\tfrac{c}{W}\left(cosh\tfrac{(Wx}{c}+\alpha)\cdot cosh(\alpha)\right)\] (2a) with \[\alpha\] = constant being a solution of: \[yL=\tfrac{c}{W}\left(cosh\tfrac{(WxL}{c}+\alpha)\cdot cosh(\alpha)\right) \tag{2b}\]

Properties of Catenary

Referring to Fig. 2, for \(\Phi=0\) two solutions agree to \(10^{-6}\)\(\mu\)m (as evaluated by Mathematica) and when \(\Phi\neq 0\) the sagitta has the properties:

\[\begin{array}{l}dy(x)=y(x)\,|\,\Phi=0\\ s(x)=dy(x)\,\cos\,\Phi\\ \end{array}\]

asymmetry of catenary quite small

Figure 2: Definition of the wire geometry for a general chamber location. The wire sagitta is denoted by ”s” with the tube located at an angle \(\Phi\) w.r.t. horizontal.

A concomitant property of the wire is its vibrating frequency

\[f_{0} =\frac{1}{2L}\left(\frac{T}{W}\right)^{1/2} \tag{3}\] \[=\ 25\;Hz\;forL=6m.\]

Having such a low fundamental frequency in long tubes could make them sensitive to small vibrations of the support structure - especially so close to a harmonic of 50 Hz. The sagitta (s) and frequency (f\({}_{0}\)) are related by the following:

\[s=\frac{1}{32}\left(\frac{g}{t^{2}}\right) \tag{4}\]

## Wire Tension Sensitivity

An important parameter of the present baseline design is the controlling of the wire position. This becomes especially critical in the case of long tubes where the sagitta is intrinsically large. For this discussion assume a fixed error \(\Delta s\leq\pm 5\;\mu m\) => \(\Delta T/T\) = \(\Delta s\) / s. As a few examples we note the following limits are needed for various wire lengths: for L = 6 m => \(\Delta T\) / T \(\leq\) 1%, for L = 3 m => \(\Delta T\) / T \(\leq\) 4% and for L = 1 m => \(\Delta T\) / T \(\leq\) 36%

Observing the obvious, the sensitivity to wire tension becomes much less critical for the shorter wire spans where, for example, we only need to control wire tension to \(\pm\) 4% for L = 3 m for the wire sagitta to be within \(\pm\) 5 \(\mu\)m. Relaxing the wire sagitta error to \(\Delta s\) = \(\pm\) 10 \(\mu\)m would probably still be acceptable so the wire tension need only be controlled to \(\pm\) 2% for the longest tubes. Maintaining the wire tension to \(\pm\)1% may be difficult.

## Temperature Dependence

The coefficient of thermal expansion of aluminum and tungsten differ by a sufficient amount such that operating a chamber in variance with the 'birth' temperature will result in a significant change in the wire sagitta. Taking the coefficient of expansion of AI, CTE = 24 x 10\({}^{\text{-}6}\) [\(\Delta x/x\) per degree K] and tungsten, W, CTE = 4.5 x 10\({}^{\text{-}6}\) [K-1] we calculate a differential length change, \(\Delta x\), per degree K. For a 6 meter tube: Al: 6x = 144 \(\mu\)m, W: 6x = 27 \(\mu\)m, \(\Delta x\)(total) = 117 \(\mu\)m. Using Hooke's Law with Young's modulus for W as, Ym(W) = 35.5 x 10\({}^{\text{6}}\) nt / cm\({}^{2}\),

\[\frac{\Delta L}{L}=\frac{T}{\sigma\,Y_{m}}=\,5.1\times 10^{\text{-}3} \tag{5}\]we note that the change in wire tension for a 3\({}^{\circ}\) K variance for a tube length L = 6 m that \(\Delta\)T/T = 0.351 mm/30 mm = 1.2 %. This changes the wire sagitta by 5.6 \(\mu\)m. Since \(\Delta\)T/T is independent of L by this effect, the sensitivity to temperature simply follows the sensitivity to wire tension. Perhaps more critical, but harder to calculate, is the effect of thermal gradients across the chambers.

### Electrostatic Instability

By electrostatic force, the wire in the exact tube center is in an unstable equilibrium and any small displacements of its position will result in the wire being pulled towards the tube wall. The amount of movement is a strong function of the off-center position of the wire in the tube. As a result the wire position is sensitive not only to its initial off-center misalignment but also is sensitive to the operating HV. Figure 3 below describes the situation.

The electrostatic force acting on the wire depends on the change of the wire-tube capacitance with wire displacement away from the tube center. Denoting C(x) the wire-wall capacitance per unit length, the force acting on the wire per unit length is:

\[F=\frac{V^{2}}{2}\ \frac{dC(x)}{dx} \tag{6}\]

Following Smythe [Static and Dynamic Electricity, McGraw-Hill Book Company, 3rd Edition, \(\geq\) 1963] or Blum and Rolandi [Particle Detection with Drift Chambers, Springer-Verlag, 1994] the capacitance per length is given by :

Figure 3: Geometry parameters relevant to wire offset instability. The offset of the wire from the tube center is denoted by x.

In Figure 4 we plot the capacitance as a function of displacement which drives the electrostatic instability.

The force is therefore controlled by:

\[\frac{\mathrm{d}\mathrm{C}(\mathrm{x})}{\mathrm{d}\mathrm{x}}=\frac{4\pi\,\epsilon _{0}\,\mathrm{x}}{\left[\mathrm{b}\,\mathrm{ln}(\mathrm{b})\right]^{2}} \tag{7b}\]

and is plotted in Figure 5, where we note the dependence is roughly linear with wire displacement, \(\mathrm{x}\).

Figure 4: The capacitance per unit length (in pF/m) is plotted with respect to the wire offset, \(\mathrm{x}\), defined in Fig. 3.

We illustrate the electrostatic instability by a few examples. In Figure 6a we show the movement of the wire with a 1 meter span over the HV range from 100 V to 10 kV (larger than would be required for operation) when the misalignment of the wire from the tube center is driven by the gravity sagitta. Additional misalignments would, of course, result in additional sensitivity to the HV but the wire moves a very small amount for small initial displacements.

In contrast, we show in Figure 6b the distortion of the wire position for a 6 meter wire span - again initiated by the gravity sagitta and driven by the

Figure 5: Electrostatic force per unit length acting on the wire as a function of wire offset, x.

electrostatic force. We note that the wire can move by almost a millimeter which is clearly unacceptable.

In Figure 7 we plot the fractional change of the maximum gravity sagitta under the influence of the electrostatic forces.

In Figure 7 we plot the fractional change of the maximum gravity sagitta under the influence of the electrostatic forces.

Figure 6b: The corresponding sagitta for a 6 meter wire vs. HV are plotted as a function of HV. Note that the sagittae change by large amounts.

Figure 7: Comparison of fractional changes in sagittae, \(\Delta\)s/s, (vertical axis) for 3 meter vs. 6 meter wires as a function of HV.

Here we note the obvious that the shorter the wire span, the smaller the distortion of the wire position from the electrostatic force. The sagitta of a 3 meter wire span changes by only 10% (\(\sim\) 12 \(\upmu\)m), up to 8 kV, whereas for a 6 meter span the sagitta changes by 70% (\(\sim\)330 \(\upmu\)m). Further, we note that the wire becomes unstable for L=6 m at V \(\approx\) 12.5 kV. For an operating HV = 4 kV the 6 m wire moves by roughly 12% of its starting sagitta, or about 60\(\upmu\)m, which is still unacceptable.

The proposed baseline solution to this problem is to make the tubes conform to the wire sagitta so as to minimize the electrostatic deflection. As a figure-of-merit for the concentricity of the tube-wire, we impose the condition that the wire moves by no more than 10 \(\upmu\)m over the HV range. Equivalently, assuming perfect endplug initial alignment, we find the maximum sagitta for which \(\Delta\)s \(\leq\) 10 \(\upmu\)m up to the maximum HV. Thus, the maximum sagitta defines the concentricity of tube vs. wire. By this criterion we determine that for a span of 3 meters the wire moves by only 12 \(\upmu\)m for s \(\approx\) 120 \(\upmu\)m in the HV range V\(\leq\) 8 kV. Hence, a 3 m span can be constructed with straight tubes, whereas tubes longer than 3 m must be bent so as to be 'no worse' than the missalignment for a 3 meter span, or the wire-tube misalignment should be no larger than 120 \(\upmu\)m. That is taken as the wire-tube alignment criterion.

### Pressure Sensitivity

One consideration with this design is that bent tubes tend to straighten under pressure. The force tending to straighten a tube is:

\[\Delta\mathrm{F}\approx\frac{32\,\mathrm{a}^{2}\,\mathrm{s}}{\mathrm{L}}\, \mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{gauge}} \tag{8}\]

For Pgauge = 2 ATM the integrated force along the length of a 6 meter tube is \(\Delta\mathrm{F}\) = 1.2 x 10-2 kg. We develop the associated deflection by scaling to tube bending under its own weight/unit length by gravity. Taking the wall thickness to be 400 \(\upmu\)m the weight per unit length is \(\omega\) = 0. 1 kg / m. For L = 6 m the deflection of a simply supported tube under gravity is

\[\Delta\mathrm{y}_{\mathrm{max}}\approx\frac{5}{384}\frac{\omega\,\mathrm{L}^{4 }}{\mathrm{E}\,\mathrm{I}}\approx 5.7\;\mathrm{cm} \tag{9}\]

Hence the straightening under pressure of a single tube is given by:

\[\Delta\mathrm{y}_{\mathrm{pressure}}\approx\frac{1.2\,\mathrm{x}\,10^{-2}}{0.6 }\;\mathrm{x}\;5.\;7\;\mathrm{cm}\approx 1.1\;\mathrm{mm} \tag{10}\]

This bending is large compared to the 120 \(\upmu\)m concentricity needed for the electrostatic stability. However, there are several mitigating factors making the effect smaller. The endcap chambers have a high bending moment and will be "stiff" in the bending direction. This is not true for the barrel chamberswhere the bending under gravity will be a lot more. If the chamber is "loaded" to bend according to the wire sagitta the loading probably must also include the pressure straightening effect. If the chambers are made "stiff" then in order to meet the stability criterion the effective moment of a chamber must satisfy \(I_{ch}>10\)\(I_{tube}\) making the straightening under pressure \(\leq 100\)\(\mu\)m. We note, however, that most tubes are shorter than \(L=6\) m where the pressure straightening is smaller, scaling as the length [\(\Delta y\sim L\)].

### Stacking Tubes / Baseline

In the baseline scheme of bending tubes we want each tube to follow its unique wire sagitta. We assume that all wires are strung at same tension (nominal 360 g). Therefore the tube stacking requires the tubes to follow the same catenary. Figure 8 illustrates the situation.

The sagittae s1 and s2 are given by the orientation of the tubes, the wire tension and the wire length. Horizontal tubes, for illustration, have

\[s_{1}=\frac{g\rho\sigma}{8T}\,L_{1}^{2},\,\,\,\,s_{2}=\frac{g\rho\sigma}{8T}\,L_ {2}^{2}.\] (11a) For tubes to be parallel we want s2 to be on the y1(x) curve. Writing this condition: \[\begin{split}& s_{2}=y_{1}(L_{1}/2)-y_{1}(\Delta L)\\ &=\frac{g\rho\sigma}{2T}\,(\Delta L^{2}\cdot\Delta L_{1}+L_{1}^{2 }/4)\\ &=\frac{g\rho\sigma}{8T}\,L_{2}^{2}\end{split} \tag{11b}\]

Figure 8: Definition of geometry appropriate for stacking bent tubes. Ideally, we require that s1 and s2 are sagittae on the same catenary. Practical considerations in chamber construction would impose the constraint s1 = s2.

with \(\Delta\)L = (L\({}_{1}\) - L\({}_{2}\)) / 2.

The obvious conclusion is that sagittae "stack", but the problem at hand is "to stack the tubes", while maintaining the overall tube-wire concentric tolerance. For this we require that bend tubes conform closely to the wire catenary. There are a number of bending possibilities [we follow the conventions of Formulas for Stress and Strain, by R. J. Roark, McGraw-Hill, 1954 ] list below.

\(\bullet\) Uniform load, supported ends [x \(\leq\) L]

\[\text{y(x)}=\text{-}\frac{\text{W}\text{x}}{24\text{ E }\text{ I }\text{L}}\text{ (L}^{3}\text{ -}2\text{L}x^{2}+x^{3}) \tag{12a}\]

\(\bullet\) Center load, supported ends [x \(\leq\) L / 2]

\[\text{y(x)}=\text{-}\frac{\text{W}\text{x}}{48\text{ E }\text{ I }}\text{ (3L}^{2}\text{ -}4\text{x}^{2}) \tag{12b}\]

\(\bullet\) Center load, fixed ends [x \(\leq\) L / 2]

\[\text{y(x)}=\text{-}\frac{\text{W}}{48\text{ E }\text{ I }}\text{ (3L}x^{2}\text{ -}4\text{x}^{3}) \tag{12c}\]

where E = Young's modulus \(\approx\) 7 x 10\({}^{6}\) nt/cm\({}^{2}\) (Al) and the moment of inertia of a tube is given by

\[\text{I}=\frac{\text{I}}{4}\,\pi\,\left(\text{b}^{4}\text{ -}\left(\text{b}\text{-}\delta\right)^{4}\right)\approx\text{rb}^{3}\delta \tag{13}\]

with \(\delta\) = wall thickness, b = tube radius and W = tube weight (or external load on tube).

The natural question is which tube bending scheme conforms best to a wire catenary? In Figure 9 we show the "normalized bend" (tube sagitta normalized to equal the wire sagitta at the wire midpoint) for the possibilities listed above.

resulting in the following normalized (scaled to the maximum sagitta) differences:

* Uniform load + supported ends: L= 6 m => x \(\leq\) 24 \(\mu\)m

Figure 10a: The difference between the wire and MDT wall, measured as a fraction of the sagitta, for a tube bent by a uniform load with supported ends to match the sagitta in middle of tube.

Figure 9: Normalized bend for a 6 meter tube for various bending possibilities.

Note that the normalized differences are independent of L. From Figs. 9 and 10 we conclude:

* _Uniform load + supported ends_ best fit to catenary. This option would be difficult to implement since it would require many jigs along the tube length.
* _Central load + supported ends_ is almost as good and is easier to realize in chamber production by requiring only a central jig.
* _Central load + fixed ends_ will not work. Take this as a warning that the tube fixturing must not constrain the slope of the tubes. The ends must be "simply" supported so that the tube angle can conform to the required tube curve.

Given the best practical choice of bending (central load + supported ends) we investigate how well the bent tubes of a chamber actually stack. As a condition we set y_bend(L/2) = y_sagitta(L/2) for each tube of a typical trapezoidal

Figure 10: The difference between the wire and MDT wall, measured as a fraction of the sagitta, for a tube bent by a curtral load with supported ends to match the sagitta in middle of tube.

chamber in the endcap. Figure 11 shows the difference between the two bending curves for tubes at the extremes taken to be L = 4 and L = 6 m in their overlap region. The actual largest endcap chamber has a smaller span between the long and short sides of the trapezoid.

Under this stacking plan the difference between the bending curves is only = 25 \(\upmu\)m between L = 4 m and L= 6 m. We conclude that tubes don't exactly "stack", but the differences of the stacking to the ideal are small if tube bend normalized to wire sagitta. This stacking scheme requires individual tubes to be bent by their own unique wire sagittae and will involve a plethora of shims.

A more practical approach would be to stack of tubes with a common middle displacement which would need only one shim size for a given chamber. How well does this work? The condition for this scheme is to take s1 = s2 defined in Fig. 8 above. In this case the following relations apply:

\[y_{\text{b}}(x)=N_{\text{b}}\ x\ (3\text{L}^{2}\ \text{- 4 x}^{2}) \tag{14}\] \[N_{\text{b}}=\frac{S_{\text{wire}}(L)}{L^{3}}\ \text{- }\frac{1}{L}\]

Figure 11: Difference of bending curves for 4 vs. 6 m, where each has been normalized to its own sagitta. The horizontal axis measures the distance along the wire where 3 meters is the midpoint of both tubes.

To see how well this stacking scheme works we take as an example the dimensions of the EOL3 chamber [L1 = 5.406 m, L2 = 6.245 m]. In Figure 12 we show the tube - wall aconcentricity versus distance along the wire.

In this case, the aconcentricity is within the acceptance criterion and is about 1/2 the maximum allowed. This is acceptable, but will have to be carefully controlled since it leaves only a 60 m margin.

### Prototype Central Wire Locator

Needed is a simple and economic method of locating the wire in the center of a tube. The basic concept proposed here is to use external jigging to precisely position the wire in the central wire locator, then slide the wire-locator assembly into the tube. The locator is made slightly oversize and is contracted by cooling for insertion into the tube. The wire is then tensioned simultaneously from each end in such a way as to leave the wire locator as a neutral point. All the needed precision of this concept is in the external jigging used to glue the wire at the center of the external wire locator and tube wall tolerance.

Figure 13 shows a prototype design for a central wire support. The wire is located by means of external jigging which places the 50 m wire in the center of the central wire locator, shown in Figure 14. Once positioned in the precision jigging, the wire is "fastened" in the center of the oversize hole in the central wire locator by means of UV cured epoxy. The main source of error is in the wall thickness (400 \(\pm\) 20 m) and eccentricity (<20m). More

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:16]

- fabrication and operation temperature must be within tight tolerance
- wire vibration frequency is low (\(\sim\)25 Hz for 6 meter span)
- wire position is sensitive to tube pressure
- wire position sensitive to HV
- chambers operate only in final position
- complicated design (each chamber unique) However, there are a number of advantages to the bent tube construction method:
- no central wire support to design
- only endplugs have to interface the tube
- wire location
- full efficiency vs. wire length An attractive alternative to the baseline design is to make all tubes straight with a central wire support for large wire spans. The performance of this design depends on longest permitted span which controls the sensitivity to wire tension and electrostatic forces. It makes sense to have at most one central wire support. The longest tube is about 6 meters so in this design no wire span is longer than 3 m (tubes have at most 1 support). The parameters of such a design are as follows:
- maximum sagitta = 118 \(\mu\)m
- maximum deflection by HV (8 kV) = 12 \(\mu\)m
- allow dT/T = 4% for \(\delta\)s \(\leq\) 5 \(\mu\)m error The advantages of using a central wire support are:
- less sensitive to wire tension
- insensitive to pressure
- less sensitive to HV
- simple geometry (all tubes straight)
- chambers operate at any \(\theta\) or \(\phi\) The disadvantages of a central wire support system are:
- small dead region in middle of tube
- another location for possible HV breakdown The challenge is to design a precise and practical central wire support. _While most of the discussion here can be found in the ATLAS Muon TDR, this work was conducted entirely independently during July, 1997._ Corresponding author: FET@mit lhs.mit.edu Web: http://mit lhs.mit.edu/~fet/atlas_mit.html
