For the ATLAS Collaboration

This paper presents an example of the utilisation of ATLAS calorimeters for B-physics analysis. We show that, using ATLAS electromagnetic calorimeter and the appropriate cuts, a 2.3% \(\eta\) reconstruction efficiency could be reached in the \(\eta\rightarrow\gamma\gamma\) channel with a background fraction of 24%. This makes possible the extension of ATLAS B-physics programme to interesting channels such as \(B_{s}^{0}\ \rightarrow\ J/\psi\ \eta\), and demonstrates that ATLAS calorimeters are performant for soft-particles measurement.

Introduction

The B-Physics programme in ATLAS is mainly based on Inner Detector measurements. The role of calorimetry is not so evident a priori, but is also quite important. Calorimeters provide electron identification, which is used in the trigger for some channels, and also contribute to muon identification. Recent studies (see for example Ref. [1]) have also shown that triggers using calorimeters to identify regions of interest (ROI) could be interesting for the ATLAS B-programme.

B-decay products are most often relatively soft particles, and ATLAS calorimeters, which have been designed primarily for Higgs and SUSY hunting, are not optimized for such particles. The following work shows that, using refined cuts, interesting results could be obtained. After a short description of the ATLAS calorimeters in Section 2, an example of a B-physics analysis using the Electromagnetic Calorimeter at the Event Filter level is presented in Section 3. Conclusions are given in Section 4.

## 2 ATLAS calorimetry overview

### Tile Calorimeter

The ATLAS Tile Calorimeter (Tilecal) is the assembly of one barrel and two "extended barrels" (see Fig. 1), covering the pseudorapidity range \(\left|\eta\right|<1.7\). Radiation-hardness, relatively smaller than in other calorimeter parts (Tilecal is the outermost detector of ATLAS calorimeter), have enabled the utilisation of more economic and less complicated techniques. Iron plates have been chosen as absorbers, and scintillating tiles as the active medium. The readout is assured by optic fibres directly connected to the tiles.

Each of the three parts of the Tilecal is divided in azimuth into 64 modules. The production of those modules began about 2 years ago, and is going on without significant difficulties.

The main purpose of this hadronic calorimeter is the energy reconstruction for hadrons and jets, but soft-muon identification (muons with \(p_{T}\) between 3 and 5 GeV), is also important.

### Liquid Argon calorimeter

The ATLAS Liquid Argon Calorimeter (Larg) is rather more complex than the Tilecal (see Fig. 1). The common point between all its subdetectors is the utilisation of Liquid Argon (at a temperature of 89 K) as the active material. Using Liquid Argon gives a detector with great resistance to radiation, good hermeticity and good energy resolution.

The Larg is divided into one electromagnetic barrel calorimeter (\(\left|\eta\right|<1.4\)), four end-cap calorimeters (the electromagnetic wheels covering the two ends with \(1.375<\left|\eta\right|<3.2\)), and two hadronic wheels covering \(1.5<\left|\eta\right|<3.2\)), and six forward modules (two electromagnetic modules covering the two ends with \(3.0<\left|\eta\right|<4.9\), and four hadronic modules covering \(3.1<\left|\eta\right|<4.9\) with two depth sampling per end).

As for the Tilecal, the Large subdetectors, except the forward detectors, are azimuthally divided into a number of modules which are now produced extensively.

As it will be used in the following section, we will give special attention to the Electromagnetic Calorimeter (Ecal). Other Large parts (hadronic endcaps and forward calorimeters) are described in detail in Ref.[2].

The Ecal uses an accordion-shaped structure (see Fig. 2). This geometry combines fast access to readout electronics with a complete symmetry in \(\phi\) direction. Showering is assured by lead plates. Shower particles ionize liquid argon and the created charges are collected on high-voltage (2000 V) electrodes; the signal is transmitted by capacitive couplings to the signal electrode. The structure of this electrode has been optimized according to the Ecal physics requirements [3]. In the barrel for example (the endcap case is nearly the same), the read-out electrode is divided into three sections in depth (see Fig. 3):

* **First Sampling** (_Strips_): This part has a very high granularity in the \(\eta\) direction, but a rather coarse one in \(\phi\) (\(\Delta\eta\times\Delta\phi=0.0031\times 0.1\)). The fine \(\eta\) granularity allows one to analyze the electromagnetic-cluster substructure (\(\gamma/\pi^{0}\) separation,...).
* **Second Sampling** (_Middle_): Most of the shower energy is deposited in this region. A square cell granularity (\(\Delta\eta\times\Delta\phi=0.025\times 0.0245\)) provides a good energy resolution to the Ecal (recent test-beam results [4] have given \(\frac{\sigma_{E}}{E}=\frac{9.5\%}{\sqrt{E}}\oplus 0.3\%\), which is in agreement with the requirements). This part is optimized for showers from high-\(p_{T}\) particles (\(\gamma\) from \(H\rightarrow\gamma\gamma\) for example).
* **Third Sampling** (_Back_): This compartment, which sees comparatively little energy for EM showers, has a coarser granularity in \(\eta\) direction (\(\Delta\eta\times\Delta\phi=0.05\times 0.0245\)).

The Ecal description is not complete without mentioning the presampler. Positionned in front of the calorimeter, this detector allows one to correct the measurement for the energy lost upstream by the particle.

## 3 ATLAS Ecal performance for B-Physics studies: the \(B_{s}^{0}\rightarrow\ J/\psi\ \eta\) example

### Physics interest

The decay \(B_{s}^{0}\to J/\psi\eta\) is phenomenologically similar to "gold-plated" mode \(B_{s}^{0}\to J/\psi\phi\). However in contrast to \(J/\psi\phi\), \(J/\psi\eta\) is a \({\cal CP}\) eigenstate. A complex angular-distributions analysis is thus not necessary for asymmetry measurement.

The branching fraction of this channel, which is theoretically estimated to be about \((8.3-9.5)\cdot 10^{-4}\)[5] (the uncertainty is mainly coming from the \(\eta-\eta^{\prime}\) mixing angle), is still not measured experimentally and will not be accessible to B-factories operating at the \(\Upsilon(4S)\) resonance. In addition, the \(B_{s}^{0}\to J/\psi\eta\ {\cal CP}\) asymmetry is expected to be relatively small within the Standard Model (\(\propto 5\%\)), and thus could provide sensitivity to new physics processes.

The reasons to include \(B_{s}^{0}\to J/\psi\eta\) in ATLAS B-physics programme are numerous. We have therefore studied the technical feasibility of such an observation.

### Event reconstruction

#### 3.2.1 Event generation

Signal events were generated using the Monte Carlo program PYTHIA 5.7[6]. \(B_{s}^{0}\) mesons were forced to decay into \(J/\psi\eta\), and \(J/\psi\) was forced to decay into two muons, one with \(p_{T}>6\) GeV and \(|\eta|<2.5\), and the other with \(p_{T}>3\) GeV and \(|\eta|<2.5\), in order to fulfill ATLAS dimuon-trigger requirements [3].

As the fake \(J/\psi\to\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\) rate in ATLAS has been shown to be very small [3], and as the \(J/\psi\) decay vertex is displaced, the physical background is dominated by \(B_{s}^{0}\to J/\psi X\) events. A sample of such events has been generated and selected in the same way as the signal events.

The signal and background events have been simulated in ATLAS detector, using a full GEANT 3-based simulation. The way those events were analyzed is described below.

#### 3.2.2 First step: \(J/\psi\) reconstruction

\(J/\psi\to\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\) reconstruction is performed using the Inner Detector. A dimuon displaced vertex is searched and the invariant mass of selected candidates is reconstructed.

Taking into account the trigger and reconstruction efficiencies in the muon spectrometer (\(85\%\) for \(p_{T}>6\) GeV muon giving first-level trigger, \(78\%\) for \(p_{T}>3\) GeV muon identified at the second level), a \(J/\psi\) reconstruction efficiency of \(52\%\) was obtained in a \(3\sigma\) mass window (\(\sigma=39\) MeV) [7].

#### 3.2.3 \(\eta\) reconstruction in the Ecal

The decay \(\eta\to\gamma\gamma\) (BR = \(39.43\%\)) was used. To reconstruct an \(\eta\) particle, two well-separated photon clusters were required (a cluster is the shower sampling based on a cell window of the Ecal \(2^{nd}\) layer). About \(85\%\) of \(\eta\to\gamma\gamma\) decays were lost due to the following effects:

* **Clusterization level**: As the \(\eta\) decay products are relatively soft, about \(80\%\) of the decays were lost due to a 1 GeV cut at clusterization in the Ecal.
* **Angular resolution**: Because of the \(\eta\) boost, the angle between the two photons is very small. As the Ecal angular resolution is limited to \(0.5^{\circ}\), there is a non-negligible proportion of superimposed clusters.
* **Electronic noise & Pile-Up**: Minimum-bias events at low luminosity (\({\cal L}\)= \(10^{33}cm^{-2}s^{-1}\)) and the electronic noise, were added at the reconstruction level to get as realistic a situation as possible. A part of the \(\eta\) signal is lost when cuts to suppress those noise are applied.

An algorithm selecting the two highest-transverse-energy clusters was developped. The \(\gamma\)/hadron rejection was based on the following rule: "_Hadron showers are wider and deeper than photon showers_". Consequently, the following selection cuts were chosen [8]:

* **Shower width 1**: In 1\({}^{st}\) layer of Ecal (Strips) there is very precise information on shower width in the \(\eta\) direction. Clusters were rejected if their total width was greater than **8 strips**.
* **Shower width 2**: The clusterization window is a \(3\times 3\) cell-window in the middle sampling, but cluster energy is also calculated in \(3\times 7\) and \(7\times 7\) cell-windows, so that there is information on cluster borders. The proportion of energy deposited outside the \(3\times 3\) window in both \(\eta\) and \(\phi\) directions could thus be calculated. This leakage proportion had to be less than **20%** in both directions.
* **Shower depth**: Clusters were rejected if more than **4%** of the total transverse energy was deposited in the Ecal back sampling or if more than **10%** of the total transverse energy was deposited in hadronic calorimeter first sampling.

After the above cuts, a 2.3% \(\eta\)-reconstruction efficiency was obtained in a 2\(\sigma\) mass (\(\sigma~{}=~{}35\) MeV), with a fake fraction of 24% (see Fig. 4). For comparison, before applying the cuts, there was a 2.9% reconstruction efficiency, but a fake fraction of 45%.

Other ideas were considered (single cluster selection, \(\gamma\) conversion). These are discussed in Ref.[8] but are not used in the present study.

### Results and comments

The \(J/\psi\) and \(\eta\) candidates were finally combined to form a \(B_{s}^{0}\) candidate. An overall 1.1% signal efficiency was obtained within three standard deviations (\(\pm 201\) MeV) of the nominal mass. The background efficiency was found to be \(\leq 0.009\%\).

Using theoretical predictions [5] for \(B_{s}^{0}\to J/\psi\eta\) branching ratio, the number of expected signal events after three years of running at low luminosity (30 fb\({}^{-1}\)) was calculated. Depending on the \(\eta-\eta^{\prime}\) mixing angle, between 8500 and 9700 signal events are expected, for about 10800 background events (see Fig. 5). A signal-to-noise ratio of about 1:1 can thus be achieved for the \(B_{s}^{0}\) signal in ATLAS.

## 4 Conclusions

This work shows that a clear \(B_{s}^{0}\to J/\psi\eta\) signal, nearly 10000 events with a signal-to-noise ratio of about 1:1, could be expected after three years of running at low luminosity in ATLAS. This result is possible because \(\eta\) particles can be reconstructed with good purity and sufficient efficiency in the Ecal. It demonstrates that, even if most of the loss of efficiency comes from the clusterization level, the ATLAS Ecal is also performant for soft particles. More generally, it confirms the fact that ATLAS calorimeter will be useful for B-physics prospects at LHC.
