###### Abstract

An estimate of the activity levels of the TRT gas system activated during LHC operation are presented. The radiation dose maps of different parts of the TRT gas system and their significance in comparison with CERN safety limits are discussed.

## 1 - Introduction

Due to the high neutron and charge particle fluxes at the ATLAS-Inner Detector, it is very probable to have radioactive isotopes produced from the circulating gas used in the detector. Depending on the lifetime of the isotope produced, the resulting activity may be quite high, and should be taken into account particularly during the run period, because part of the gas is supposed to be always in accessible areas.

## 2 - Calculation of Activity

There are several processes to produce radioactive isotopes like (n,\(\gamma\)), (n,2n), (\(\pi\), p) etc. Among those, neutron capture process has the highest significance for the TRT gas activation because of its large cross section at low neutron energies. Other reactions are very important at high energies but cross section in this region is rather low. For instance, for activation of the TRT active gas \({}^{11}\)C isotope can be produced in reaction like (n,2n) or (\(\pi\),p) at the particle energies above 20 MeV. At these energies cross section is about 20 mb and calculated maximum activity of 1 kg of Carbon (or Fluorine) is about 10\({}^{-4}\) mCi, whereas for 1 kg of Xe activated by slow neutron the maximum activity is ~0.4 mCi.

The dominating low energy neutron flux in the TRT region, as well as the high neutron capture cross-sections of the nuclides at low energies, motivate the study of (n,\(\gamma\)) reactions.

Activity is defined as the number of decays per second, but a specific activity, which takes into account the number of particles emitted per decay, is considered here. The specific activity A can be calculated as:

\[\mbox{A}=\Phi\.\ \sigma\.\ \mbox{N}\.\ \mbox{M}\.\ \mbox{X}\.\ \mbox{( build up )}\.\ \mbox{( decay )}\]

where: \(\Phi\) is the neutron flux (kHz/cm\({}^{2}\)), \(\sigma\) is the neutron capture cross-section (10\({}^{24}\) barn), N is the number of parent atoms per unit mass (atoms/g), M is the mass of element considered (g), and X is the number of particles emitted per decay. The effect of build-up and decay are calculated as:

\[\mbox{( build up )}=1-\mbox{e}^{-(\lambda\.\ \mbox{T})}\]

\[\mbox{( decay )}=\mbox{e}^{-(\lambda\.\ 1)}\]

where \(\lambda\)=(ln2)/T\({}_{1/2}\), T\({}_{1/2}\) is the half-life, T is the irradiation time (a maximum running time of 100 days per year is assumed at the LHC), and t is the decay time (the rest of the year ~ 250 days). The build-up factor determines how many isotopes of our interest are produced during the irradiation time which is the run period taken as 100 days for a year. When the beam is off, the decay factor calculates the number of decays for the rest of the year. The neutron flux values for different energy ranges are considered as described in Section 4. The cross-sections for each nuclide are read from data files [7, 8, 9, 1] which contain about 10\({}^{3}\)- 10\({}^{4}\) points and then their average is calculated for each energy range considered in the neutron flux mapping.

## 3 - Radiation Dose and CERN Safety Limits

The standard unit of activity is Becquerel (Bq) which is number of particles per second. Relation between often used Curie (Ci), and Becquerel is 1 Ci = 3.7 x 10\({}^{10}\) Bq (or 3.7 x 10\({}^{10}\) sec-1). The product of the absorbed dose in tissue due to radiation, so called the dose equivalent, is expressed in units of Sievert (Sv: 1 Sv = 1 J/kg).

There are two types of decays which should be considered separately, gamma and beta decays. For the gamma decays, so called "gamma exposure factor" (also known as the specific gamma constant) should be taken into account. It relates the activity of a point source with a certain energy to the dose equivalent at a distance. This specific gamma constant "T" is given in Figure 3-1 (right vertical axis) where, the relation between a point-like activity of 1 Ci with the given photon energy in MeV and the equivalent dose at a distance of 1 meter in units of R/h, is presented (100R=Sv)[7-2].

## 5 Active Gas

Active detector volume is about 2.4 m\({}^{3}\). The TRT active gas composition is 70%Xe + 20%CF\({}_{4}\)+10%CO\({}_{2}\). In Table 5-1, a summary of natural abundance, possible radioactive products, their half-lives and maximum cross-section for (n,\(\gamma\)) reaction are given [7, 8, 9]. Only Xe has large neutron capture cross-section and should be considered as potentially dangerous element. In calculations, isotopes with cross-sections less than 10\({}^{2}\) barn, or with lifetimes less than a few minutes are ignored (assuming ~10 minutes minimum for gas to travel from detector to accesible areas).

The neutron capture cross-sections [7, 8, 9] of the gray-shaded isotopes are presented in Appendix I, (Figure 8-1 to Figure 8-6) and the necessary parameters for the calculation of gamma activities are tabulated in Table 5-2 [7, 8, 9]. K is the factor (branching ratio) which allows one to obtain the cross-section for the particular state of isotope from the total neutron capture cross-section of the parent nuclide [7, 8, 9]. Hence, the cross-sections presented in Appendix I must be multiplied by the K value of the isotope, before being used in activity calculation. Number of photons per decay (X) is shown in this table as well. Radioisotopes that emit \(\beta\) particles are only 133Xe and 135Xe with 0.427 MeV and 1.151 MeV maximum energies respectively, of course, in this case the number of particles emitted per decay (X) is 1 by definition.

\end{table}
Table 5-1 Activation properties of C, F, O and XeThe gamma activity of each isotope is calculated for 1 kg of the bulk material ( Appendix II, Figure 9-1 to Figure 9-8), so that it is easy to estimate the total activity by scaling to the amount of the material to be used. Beta activity of Xenon is not taken into account because the minimum thickness of any gas system wall is 0.5 mm of stainless steel which will completely attenuate the radiation.

Figure 5-2 shows that the activity of \({}^{125}\)I dominates after 20 days. The soft gamma irradiation (35 keV) produced by \({}^{125}\)I is easily attenuated, for instance, by a steel wall of 2 mm thickness, but there are other isotopes which have longer lifetimes and large activity which produce photons with energies of - 200 keV and 500 keV, see Figure 5-3 for relative activities and Table 5-3 for photon energy spectrum.

The basic considerations described above are sufficient to estimate the radioactivity of different parts of the TRT active gas system and make recommendations for a safe gas-system design. For certain parts of the TRT gas system, the dose rate would exceed highest safety level, and special shielding would have to be produced to attenuate the photon flux. The thickness of this shielding and the choice of material are determined by the photon energy spectrum (Table 5-3) since the specific gamma constant which is used in the radiation dose calculations is energy dependent. The overall \(\Gamma\) of xenon is 0.9 at maximum activity and 0.3 after10 days of cooling.

The attenuation length of different materials as a function of photon energy is shown in Figure 5-4. The percentages of the total photon flux and the equivalent dose rate after various shieldings are given in Table 5-5. A steel wall of 2 mm thickness is sufficient to stop 35 keV photons, but not very effective for larger photon energies. The photon energy spectrum changes substantially after the end of the LHC run. Table 5-5 also shows the shielding efficiency 10 days after the end of the LHC run. The impact of these numbers on the design of the active gas system is described in the following subsections.

Figure 5 - 4 Photon attenuation length as a function of photon energy

## 5-1 Gas Racks

The TRT gas racks are situated in three areas: UX15, USA15 and the surface building. They are quite densely packed and contain some volumes with a large amount of gas (purification modules, buffers and other elements). These volumes may have a large activity and should therefore certainly be shielded. This issue is discussed in one of the next sub-sections. Only the radiation dose rates for racks without large concentrations of the active gas are presented here.

It is assumed that one rack contains 50 m of pipes (100 pipes of 50 cm length) with a diameter of 6 mm, uniformly distributed in the rack volume and filled with Xenon at 2 atm. This amounts to ~1.4 l of Xenon. Assuming that there will be valves and other elements in the rack, the total volume is presumably closer to 3 l of Xenon at 2 atm. The maximum activity for this amount of gas is 0.012 mCi (at 1 atm, 1m\({}^{3}\) corresponds to ~2 mCi). This activity will be uniformly distributed across the volume of the rack, with the corresponding dimensions shown in Figure 5-1. The resulting radiation dose rate as a function of distance from the rack is shown in Figure 5-1.

2. It is calculated at the middle of the rack, where the maximum accumulated radiation will be found. At the surface of the rack, the radiation dose is < 0.06 \(\mu\)Sv/h, below the 0.5 \(\mu\)Sv/h limit for public area, Table 3-1. Even inside the rack volume (at the centre), the dose rate does not exceed ~0.09 \(\mu\)Sv/h.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{l l l l l} \hline \hline
**Materials and** & **Percentage of** & **Equivalent dose** & **Percentage of total** & **Equivalent dose** \\
**their thickness** & **photon flux after** & **rate variation after** & **photon flux after** & **rate variation in 10** \\
**shield at** & **shield** & **shield in 10 days** & **days after the end** \\  & **maximum activity** & & **after runs finished** & **of the run** \\ \hline
2mm Steel & 62\% & 80\% & 26\% & 43\% \\
2mm Lead & 26\% & 40\% & 10\% & 18\% \\
5 mm Lead & 7\% & 15\% & 2\% & 4\% \\
10mm Lead & 2\% & 6\% & 0.5\% & 0.4\% \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 5-5 Photon flux and equivalent dose attenuation

## 5-2 Piping

There are a few large-diameter pipes running through different areas to the surface building. Since access to these pipes is not restricted a priory, one has to check that the dose rate on their surface does not exceed appropriate safety limit. As an example, one can consider two pipes going down to USA-15 from the surface building with a diameter of about 28 mm or 42mm.

An estimate of the dose rate has been carried out assuming an infinite length for these pipes. In general, the radiation dose rate at a distance 'X' from a pipe with diameter d would be (0.12 d / X) uSv/h where both d and X are in metres. Hence, for two pipes the total dose rate will be about (0.24 d / X) uSv/h. That gives ~0.5 uSv/h on the pipe surface for pipes with 28 mm diameter and ~0.7 uSv/h for pipes with 42 mm diameter, which is at the level of public area limit (0.5 uSv/h).

## 5-3 Compact Volumes

A few gas containers are used in the TRT active gas system. The largest one (the so-called buffer) contains 200 litres of active gas. The others, such as the purification modules, the small buffers, the pump will contain at most a few litres of the gas. Since the real design of these elements does not exist yet, it is not possible to make accurate evaluations, but it is nevertheless useful to obtain estimates for a gas volume of few litres which can then be easily scaled to the real element sizes.

As an example, one can consider container of 5 litres filled with xenon at 2 atm in a geometry shown in Figure 5-3-1. The total activity which will be distributed over the volume is 0.02 mCi. The maximum radiation dose rate as a function of distance to the cylinder (middle point) is mapped in Figure 5-3-1.

One can see that dose rate is about 2.3 \(\mu\)Sv/h on surface. Since this value is already below the supervised area limit of 7.5 \(\mu\)Sv/h, no special shield is required.

Another example is a volume of 60 liters at 2 atm with the geometry as in Figure 5-3-1. Such a container will have a total activity of 0.24 mCi distributed over the volume. As seen from Figure 5-3-2, the maximum radiation dose on the surface is 5.2 \(\mu\)Sv/h which is below 7.5 \(\mu\)Sv/h, hence no special shielding is necessary concerning the supervised area limits.

The large buffer of 200 I can be represented as a cylinder with a length equal to its diameter. This would contain ~ 1kg of Xe (at 1 atm). The maximum activity of this amount of gas will be ~0.4 mCi. The radiation dose rate as a function of the distance from the buffer surface is mapped in Figure 5-3-3. One can see that on the cylinder surface the dose rate reaches a value of ~10 \(\mu\)Sv/h. In order to reduce this radiation to an acceptable level, buffer should be surrounded with a lead wall of 2 mm thickness. This would reduce the maximum dose rate to the level of 4 \(\mu\)Sv/h (Table 5-5 ), which is below supervised area limit (7.5 \(\mu\)Sv/h).

## 5-4 Gas Recuperation System

The recuperation system is supposed to recover the expensive xenon gas when the total gas volume has to be exchanged or when the detector volume has to be emptied at the end of a run. The full amount of xenon gas would then be accumulated to this system, i.e. -20 kg of Xe gas. The total activity of this gas at maximum LHC activity will be -8 mCi, which results in 230 eV/h on the volume surface. Two scenarios can be considered. The first one corresponds to the case when this amount of gas is extracted during LHC operation. If all the gas is accumulated in one bottle (standard one of 40 l), the dose rate on the bottle surface will be very large, as shown in Figure 5-4-1.

Nevertheless, at a distance of 20 cm from the bottle surface, the dose rate is about 55 eV/ h and a lead wall of 10 mm thickness will attenuate this dose rate down to the level of 3.3 eV/h. If the same recovery operation is performed 10 days after the end of the run the requirement for shielding becomes less stringent, because the total activity of 20 kg of Xe will be reduced to 2.7 mCi which corresponds to a radiation dose of 6.2 eV/h 20cm away from the bottle. Since the shield efficiency will be larger (see Table 5-5 ), the maximum radiation dose rate behind a 10 mm thick lead wall would be 0.02 eV/h. The design of the gas recuperation system will obviously have to include the requirement that it operates in a completely automatic mode.

Figure 5-4-1 Gamma radiation dose as a function of distance from a container of 40 litres containing 20 kg Xe with dimensions length=4xdiameterThere is another option which might be considered: release the xenon to the atmosphere for the high-luminosity operation of the LHC. In that case, the requirements for xenon recuperation system would be much less stringent for the first three years of LHC operation. The only precaution needed in that case will be to dilute the Xenon gas in the ambient air to the level required by the safety rules.

## 5-5 TRT Gas Losses to the ATLAS Cavern

The TRT detector is not completely gas-tight. The expected Xe gas loss to the ATLAS cavern is about 2.4 m\({}^{3}\)/month. The ATLAS cavern has a volume of 55,000 m\({}^{3}\) and the ventilation is designed for 60,000 m\({}^{3}\)/h with a 5% gas exchange (3,000 m\({}^{3}\)/h of new gas). If all the Xe gas were lost to the cavern then the Xe concentration inside of the cavern would be ~1 ppm. This means that 55 I of Xe or 0.1 mCi would be distributed over the cavern resulting in a dose rate of ~8\(\cdot\)10\({}^{-4}\) uSv/h inside of the cavern, which can safely be neglected.

## 6-Conclusions

The expected xenon activity is not negligible, hence it should be taken into account during the design phase of the whole TRT gas system.

Most parts of the TRT gas system have rates below supervised limit. Yet these levels can be lowered down to public area requirements if special shielding is used.

The most active part of the gas system is the recuperation system. 10 mm lead shield reduces the radiation dose to the level of supervised area limits

The possible leakage of xenon into the ATLAS cavern does not lead to any safety problems.
