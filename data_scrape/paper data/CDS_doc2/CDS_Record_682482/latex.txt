**Abstract**

**We present hereafter complements on the search for chargino-neutralino pairs in the trilepton mode that we first described in the ATLAS Internal Note PHYS-No-61. The reach of this channel in the (\(m_{\hat{g}}\), \(\mu\)) plane is estimated and the high luminosity analysis based on an improved ATLAS parametrization is presented.**

## I. Introduction.

Here's a reminder of the note PHYS-No-61 conclusions:

\(\bullet\)\(\tilde{\chi}_{1}^{\pm}\tilde{\chi}_{2}^{0}\longrightarrow 3\ell+\)\(p_{T}^{miss}\) is the most suited process to detect chargino-neutralino pairs in hadronic collisions,

\(\bullet\) but this signal suffers both from SM (\(t\overline{t},WZ,ZZ,\)...) and MSSM background (\(\tilde{g}\tilde{g},\)...,\(\tilde{\ell}\tilde{\ell}\), other \(\tilde{\chi}_{i}^{\pm}\tilde{\chi}_{j}^{0}\) processes). Hence the search for this signal is a counting experiment which statistical significance is dominated by the systematics on the background evaluation,

\(\bullet\) one can detect an excess (due to the MSSM) in the trilepton rates with respect to SM predictions after one year of run at low luminosity for \(200<m_{\tilde{g}}<500\) GeV and in these conditions one can extract the particular \(\tilde{\chi}_{1}^{\pm}\tilde{\chi}_{2}^{0}\longrightarrow 3\ell+\)\(p_{T}^{miss}\) process.

We present hereafter the reach of the trilepton signal in the parameter space after one year of run at low luminosity (\(\int{\cal L}dt=10^{4}\) pb\({}^{-1}\)). We remind that in the note 61 we had generated the signal and the SUSY background for:

\(\bullet\)\(m_{\tilde{g}}\) = 200, 300, 400, 500 and 600 GeV,

\(\bullet\)\(\mu\) = \(-m_{\tilde{g}}\),

\(\bullet\)\(m_{\tilde{q}}\) = \(2\times m_{\tilde{g}}\) and \(m_{\tilde{q}}\) = \(m_{\tilde{g}}\) + 20 GeV,

\(\bullet\)\(tan\beta\) = 2.

Two conditions can enhance significantly the \(\tilde{\chi}_{2}^{0}\) (and/or the \(\tilde{\chi}_{1}^{\pm}\)) leptonic branching ratios (BR). One is: \(m_{\tilde{q}}\approx m_{\tilde{g}}\) and the other: \(|\mu|\approx m_{\tilde{g}}\). The first condition was taken into account in our event generation and a check was made with the less favorable condition \(m_{\tilde{q}}=2\times m_{\tilde{g}}\). The second condition was always fulfilled for we generated events with \(|\mu|=-m_{\tilde{g}}\) in order to reduce the actual number of parameters. But what would happen if \(\mu\neq-m_{\tilde{g}}\)? To answer this question we'll use a heuristic method which isn't rigorous but can give a good idea of the extrapolation of our results to the rest of the gaugino parameter space.

**II. The trilepton reach in the gaugino parameter space.**

**II.1. Description of an extrapolation method.**

We'll use an approximate method to extrapolate our results to the rest of the gaugino parameter space because redoing the events generation and analysis with a scan of \(\mu\) would be a prohibitive task due to the CPU time it would require. On the other hand it is easy to get the variations of the signal inclusive trilepton cross-section \(\sigma(pp\rightarrow\tilde{\chi}_{1}^{\pm}\tilde{\chi}_{2}^{0})\times BR( \tilde{\chi}_{1}^{\pm}\tilde{\chi}_{2}^{0}\to 3\ell+\mbox{X})\) as a function of \(\mu\). So we'll base the method on this significant information.

The method can be summarized by two formulae. For a given gluino mass we've got:

\(\bullet\) for the number of signal events S: \(S(\mu\neq-m_{\tilde{g}})=S(\mu=-m_{\tilde{g}})\times\frac{\sigma_{3\ell}(\mu \neq-m_{\tilde{g}})}{\sigma_{3\ell}(\mu=-m_{\tilde{g}})}\),\(\bullet\) for the number of background events B: \(B(\mu\neq-m_{\hat{g}})\approx B(\mu=-m_{\hat{g}})\).

The hypothesis implicitely adopted above demand some justifications. Why are they taken for fixed gluino masses? Why can we neglect the background variations as a function of \(\mu\) in this case? Why should the ratio \(\frac{S}{\sigma_{3\ell}}\) be independant of \(\mu\)?

First, we notice an hierarchy between the three significant parameters of the MSSM gaugino sector: \(m_{\hat{g}}\), \(\mu\) and \(tan\beta\). \(m_{\hat{g}}\) is the most influent one. Then there's the \(\mu\) parameter which can give dramatic variations to the gaugino masses and couplings when it has a small absolute value (typically of 200 GeV or less) but it has a moderate influence on them for larger absolute values. And finally all these quantities vary quite smoothly with \(tan\beta\). Therefore, we consider \(m_{\hat{g}}\) as the main parameter for the signal efficiency and the SUSY background rejection.

The number of background events is due to two contributions: \(B=B_{{}_{SM}}+B_{{}_{MSSM}}\). It is obvious that \(B_{{}_{SM}}\) is independant of \(\mu\). The main contributions to \(B_{{}_{MSSM}}\) come from the strong and associated production of trileptons: \(\tilde{g}\tilde{g}+\tilde{q}\tilde{g}+\tilde{q}\tilde{q}+\tilde{G}\tilde{g} +\tilde{G}\tilde{q}\longrightarrow 3\ell+{\rm X}\). Looking at the global rejection factors3 obtained with the TP cuts and the jet veto [1] on each of these processes, one finds values ranging from O(10\({}^{4}\)) up to O(10\({}^{6}\)). The actual rejection factors are even larger for they can be written as: \(R=\frac{R_{global}}{BR(\to 3\ell+{\rm X})}\), so that \(R>R_{global}\). Given these levels of rejection, one can ensure that, for the background events passing the cuts, \(B_{{}_{MSSM}}<<S\) and \(\Delta B_{{}_{MSSM}}<<\Delta S\). Hence the background variation as a function of \(\mu\) shouldn't affect much the signal statistical significance.

Footnote 3: These high factors result essentially from the rejection of the hadronic activity in the trilepton events (they are partly due to the lepton isolation and mainly to the jet veto). It’s clear that the hadronic activity depends less on \(\mu\) but would be very sensitive to \(m_{\hat{g}}\) and \(\frac{m_{\hat{g}}}{m_{\hat{g}}}\).

The number of signal events can be written as \(S=\int{\cal L}\,dt\times\sigma(pp\to\tilde{\chi}^{\pm}_{1}\tilde{\chi}^{0}_{2 })\times BR(\tilde{\chi}^{\pm}_{1}\tilde{\chi}^{0}_{2}\to 3\ell+X)\times \epsilon_{cut}\times\epsilon_{3\ell}\), where \(\epsilon_{cut}\) and \(\epsilon_{3\ell}\) are respectively the efficiencies of the cuts and of the trileptons identification. As \(\mu\) doesn't change much the features of the signal events, this parameter will only induce variations in the signal trilepton inclusive cross-section \(\sigma_{3\ell}\). Therefore the ratio \(\frac{S}{\sigma_{3\ell}}\) should merely vary with \(\mu\).

**II.2. Applying the method.**

For a given gluino mass, we compared the trilepton inclusive cross-sections of the signal for different values of \(\mu\): \(\mu=-m_{\hat{g}}\) like in our events generation to \(|\mu|<750\) GeV but \(\mu\neq-m_{\hat{g}}\). For instance, for

\[\cases{m_{\hat{g}}=-\mu=400\ GeV\cr m_{\hat{q}}=420\ GeV\cr tan\beta=2},\]

we had in our analysis \(\sigma(pp\to\tilde{\chi}^{\pm}_{1}\tilde{\chi}^{0}_{2})\times BR(\tilde{\chi }^{\pm}_{1}\tilde{\chi}^{0}_{2}\to 3\ell+X)=0.38\) pb which represented 269.34 remaining events for \(\int{\cal L}\,dt=10^{4}\) pb\({}^{-1}\) after the TP cuts and the jet veto [1]. Among all the background processes, only WZ, ZZ, \(\tilde{\chi}^{\pm}_{2}\tilde{\chi}^{0}_{3}\), \(\tilde{\chi}^{0}_{3}\tilde{\chi}^{0}_{4}\), \(\tilde{\ell}\tilde{\ell}\) events passed the cuts representing 78.74 events; this gave a statistical significance of \(S/\sqrt{S+B}=14.44\).

We used the curve displayed on figure 1 to get the signal inclusive trilepton cross-section for \(\mu\neq\) -400 GeV.

For example, for \(\mu\) = -200 GeV, \(\sigma(3\ell)\approx\)0.085 pb. This was about 22.5 % of the \(\sigma(3\ell)\) at \(\mu\) = -400 GeV and, to keep the same efficiency for the signal, we kept the same proportion of accepted events: 60.451 events. The gluino mass being the same, we assumed a constant level of background, the corresponding significance was then \(S/\sqrt{S+B}=5.12\), hence this point was considered accessible with the trilepton signal (with the usual 5\(\sigma\) criterion). Then we iterated this procedure for the different values of \(m_{\tilde{g}}\) and for the two relations between \(m_{\tilde{g}}\) and \(m_{\tilde{q}}\): \(m_{\tilde{q}}=2\times m_{\tilde{g}}\) and \(m_{\tilde{q}}=m_{\tilde{g}}\) + 20 GeV.

**II.3. Results of the extrapolation.**

The results are summarized on figures 2 and 3 displaying on the \((m_{\tilde{g}},\mu)\) plane, on top of the LEP and TEVATRON exclusion regions, the domain to be probed with the trilepton channel at LHC. We notice that the region accessible at LHC beyond the reach of LEP II corresponds to high gluino masses (\(m_{\tilde{g}}\geq 400\) GeV for \(\mu<\)0 and \(m_{\tilde{g}}\geq 450\) GeV for \(\mu>\)0). Besides, comparing the cases where one has \(m_{\tilde{q}}=2\times m_{\tilde{g}}\) or \(m_{\tilde{q}}=m_{\tilde{g}}\) + 20 GeV, one can say that the enhancement in the signal production cross-section observed in the first case is approximately compensated by the correlative reduction of the leptonic branching fractions (see for example the figures 6, 7 and 10 in reference [1]). That's why the domains probed in the two cases aren't so different. For \(tan\beta=20\), there's a reduction of 25 to 35 % of the signal \(\sigma(3\ell)\) so there should be a smaller accessible domain on the \((m_{\tilde{g}},\mu)\) plane.

Fig. 1: \(\sigma(pp\rightarrow\tilde{\chi}_{1}^{\pm}\tilde{\chi}_{2}^{0})\times BR( \tilde{\chi}_{1}^{\pm}\tilde{\chi}_{2}^{0}\to 3\ell+X)\) in pb as a function of \(\mu\) in GeV.

Fig. 2: Reach of the trilepton signal at LHC, \(tan\beta=2\) and \(m_{\tilde{q}}=m_{\tilde{g}}+\) 20 GeV. The black circles correspond to a 5\(\sigma\) reach, the open triangles a 3\(\sigma\) whilst the black squares correspond to significances less than 3. On backdrop one has the excluded regions of LEP I (solid), LEP II (dash-dot) and TEVATRON (dash) for different values of \(tan\beta\).

**III. High luminosity analysis.**

**III.1. The changes with respect to the low lumon\[\left\{\begin{array}{l}A=10\%:\mbox{as sampling term},\\ B=1\%:\mbox{as constant term},\\ C=0.4\ GeV:\mbox{as elctronic noise term},\\ \left\{\begin{array}{l}\alpha=4:\mbox{for }1.3<\eta|<1.6,\mbox{ to account for the cracks}\\ \alpha=1:\forall|\eta|<1.3\mbox{ or }|\eta|>1.6.\end{array}\right.\end{array}\right.\]

What's more, we required that 0.5\(<\frac{E}{p}<\)1.5 for the triggered electrons, with E being smeared by the ECAL resolution and p by the INDET one. This cut was applied with the efficiency of the bremsstrahlung correction procedure given in table 3.13 in [8] that depends on the electron transverse momemtum and pseudo-rapidity.

\(\bullet\) the TICAL resolution for the hadrons within \(|\eta|<3\):

\[\frac{\sigma_{E}}{E}=\beta\left(\frac{A}{\sqrt{E}}\oplus B\right)\,with\]

\[\left\{\begin{array}{l}A=50\%:\mbox{as sampling term},\\ B=3\%:\mbox{as constant term},\\ \left\{\begin{array}{l}\beta=4:\mbox{for }1.1<|\eta|<1.3,\mbox{ to account for the cracks and}\\ \beta=1:\forall|\eta|<1.1\mbox{ or }|\eta|>1.3],\end{array}\right.\end{array}\right.\]

\(\bullet\) the muon spectrometer resolution [8]:

\[\left\{\begin{array}{l}\frac{\Delta p}{p}=2.5\%\mbox{ for }p<20\mbox{ GeV},\\ \frac{\Delta p}{p}=2\%\mbox{ for }20\leq p<200\mbox{ GeV},\\ \frac{\Delta p}{p}=3\%\mbox{ for }200\leq p<500\mbox{ GeV and}\\ \frac{\Delta p}{p}=5\%\mbox{ for p}\geq 500\mbox{ GeV},\end{array}\right.\]

\(\bullet\) the forward calorimeter resolution:

\[\left\{\begin{array}{l}\frac{\sigma_{E}}{E}=\frac{60\%}{\sqrt{E}}\oplus 30 \%\oplus\frac{10\ GeV}{E}\mbox{ for the electrons and photons, and}\\ \frac{\sigma_{E}}{E}=\frac{150\%}{\sqrt{E}}\oplus 7\%\oplus\frac{10\ GeV}{E} \mbox{ for the hadrons, all within }3<|\eta|<5,\end{array}\right.\]

\(\bullet\) we used the same jet reconstruction algorithm as in the low luminosity analysis but with different thresholds:

\[\left\{\begin{array}{l}.\mbox{ the jet cone size was decreased to }\Delta\mbox{R}=0.5\mbox{ to take in account the pile }-\mbox{up},\\.\mbox{ a threshold of E}_{{}_{T}}=\)0.5 GeV was applied on all the cells,\\.\mbox{ a threshold of E}_{{}_{T}}=\)1.5 GeV was applied on all jet initiator cells and\\.\mbox{ the hadronic clusters with E}_{{}_{T}}>\)25 GeV were considered as jets.

\(\bullet\) The missing transverse momentum was calculated as the vector sum of all stable particles transverse momenta (smeared by the sub-detectors resolutions) within \(|\eta|<\)5, except for the neutrinos and LSPs (\(\tilde{\chi}^{0}_{1}\)).

We neglected all \(\phi\)-dependance of the detector response.

**III.2. The cuts.**

To separate the signal from the background at high luminosity, we've adopted the following set of cuts that will be referred to as TP' cuts. We required:

(1) \(3\ell\) (e\({}^{\pm}\)_or_\(\mu^{\pm}\)) within \(|\eta|<\)2.5,

(1') \(\forall e^{\pm},\ 0.5<\frac{E}{p}<1.5\),

(2) \(p_{{}_{T}}\,(l_{1},\,l_{2})>\) 20 GeV and \(p_{{}_{T}}(l_{3})>10\) GeV,

(3) one OS-SF lepton pair per event,

(4) \(|m_{l^{+}l--}-m_{Z}|>\)7.5 GeV,

(5) lepton isolation: \(E_{{}_{T}}^{HAD}<10\) GeV in a cone of \(\Delta R=\sqrt{\Delta\eta^{2}+\Delta\phi^{2}}=\)0.2 around each triggered lepton,

(6) central jet veto: \(p_{{}_{T}}(jet)<\)50 GeV, \(\forall\)\(|\eta_{jet}|<\)3.

We kept the overall 90% lepton identification efficiency as well as the 1% charge misassignment.

**III.3. The analysis results.**

After applying the TP' cuts we got the results summarized in tables 1 to 11.

From these numbers one can derive the signal statistical significance:

It is obvious from this plot that the statistics is sufficient to cover the whole range: 200\(\leq m_{\tilde{g}}\leq\)600 GeV. So it appears clearly that the gain of an order of magnitude in the integrated luminosity washes completely the pile-up effects.

## IV. Conclusions.

With an integrated luminosity of \(\int{\cal L}dt=10^{4}\)pb\({}^{-1}\) the trilepton signal should allow to cover the plane \((m_{\hat{g}},\mu)\) for low \(tan\beta\), the reach should be slightly reduced for higher values of \(tan\beta\). In particular, parts of the latter plane, out of the reach of LEP II, should be accessible at the LHC for \(m_{\hat{g}}>\)400 GeV.

One year of LHC run at high luminosity (\(\int{\cal L}dt=10^{5}\)pb\({}^{-1}\)) allows to cover the whole gluino mass range of interest for the trilepton search: 200\(\leq m_{\hat{g}}\leq\)600 GeV with statistical significances well in excess of the 5\(\sigma\) discovery criterion, despite the pile-up.

One should also note that in the present and in the preceeding analysis we used only one year of integrated luminosity and we didn't optimize the cuts for the masses of the searched \(\tilde{\chi}_{1}^{\pm}\) and \(\tilde{\chi}_{2}^{0}\). This should give a confortable margin to ensure the results of our analysis in both cases and probably allow for abundant statistics for precision measurements in the MSSM gaugino sector.

We'd like to thank G. Polesello, D. Froidevaux and H. Haber for the useful discussions we had. Thanks to H. Baer and X. Tata for their careful reading of the note 61.

## Erratum.

Here we'd like to rectify a few mistakes or imprecisions of the note PHYS-No-61:

\(\bullet\) in figure 6 the \(\tilde{\chi}_{1}^{\pm}\tilde{\chi}_{2}^{0}\) cross-section as a function of \(\mu\) should be multiplied by two,

\(\bullet\) the statistical significances given for the trilepton search at 9 TeV were fortunately wrong: there was a error in the integration bounds for the 9 TeV cross-sections evaluation; the corrected significances at \(\sqrt{s}=9.3\) TeV are displayed in Fig. 4 which should replace Fig. 21.b.

\(\bullet\) in the appendix, we made a distinction between the MSSM and the minimal SUGRA model stating abusively that the first is a global SUSY model whilst the other is local. In fact, both are low energy approximations of a SUGRA or a superstring theory: both have decoupled from gravity and verify global SUSY at low energy,

\(\bullet\) still in the appendix, we told that the trilinear and bilinear couplings A and B were set null at the EW scale, it is generally wrong to do so but it doesn't affect our study because it essentially influences the phenomenology of the third generation of squarks.
