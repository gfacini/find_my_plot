**Fluid services for the ATLAS TRT detector**

**Abstract**

This note explains the rational for the selected "fan-out" of the fluid services in the ATLAS TRT detector. The present design has evolved through a number of discussions involving Claude Menot, Hans Danielsson, Claude Hauviller, Torsten Akesson and Rikard Gebart. Most of the information is collected in a compact form (Excel table) by Claude Menot but the purpose of this note is to make sure that the motivation for these choices are remembered.

## Background

The fluid services for both the barrel and the wheels can be divided in 4 groups:

1. Active gas

2. Vertilation/cooling gas

3. Straw water

4. Electronics water

The active gas is the gas that circulates inside the straws, the ventilation/cooling gas is the CO2 that ventilates the radiator volume. Straw water is water that cools the detector volume and electronics water is the cooling water for the electronic circuits.

The discussion below is mostly done for one side of the detector but the design is of course the same on the other side except for the barrel where the difference is explicitly stated.

One of the possible problems in the operation of the detector is that ageing of the straws can lead to a large rupture in the straw. This would lead to a major leak of active gas that would disturb the detector function severely and lead to high costs for Xenon loss. The guiding principle in the design of the active gas services has therefore been to provide a way of shutting off a small section of the detector including the leaking straw. This possibility of "sectioning" the detector is not crucial for the other fluid services and hence a less fine grained fan-out is selected for them.

## Patch panels

The present plan for the operation of the detector is to have a "complete" opening of the detector every year during periodic service in the winter. During the operational period (summer half of the year) two "partial" openings (every two months) when the end cap calorimeters are rolled away has been requested. A natural choice is therefore to have a patch panel for each of the TRT barrel and the TRTforward wheels in the gap between the end cap toroid calorimeter and the barrel toroid calorimeter that can be accessed during these "partial" openings.

In addition to the patch panels in the gap between the end cap and the barrel it is necessary to have a patch panel closer to the TRT subdetectors to facilitate the assembly and installation of the whole TRT detector. The patch panel for the barrel TRT will be located between the barrel and the first wheel in the forward region and that for the forward region will be located at the beginning of the gap close to the last of wheel type C.

A sketch of the patch panels is shown in Figure 1 to make it easier to follow the discussion below. The patch panels are named PPB1 and PPB2 for the barrel and PPF1 and PPF2 for the forward wheels, starting from the centre of the detector (see fig.1).

### Barrel

All the information about the fluid services for the Barrel TRT are collected in Appendix 1. The description in the following should be seen as a complement.

Figure 1: Simplified sketch of the TRT region showing the approximate location of the patch panels. PPB indicates patch panels for the barrel and PPF indicates patch panels for the TRT forward.

The barrel is divided in azimuthal sectors, each sector contains 3 modules (see Figure 2). The active gas is fed in two separate lines to each module individually (192 lines on each side of the barrel) and the tubes for this go to PPB1. The full number of tubes are drawn from PPB1 to PPB2 to make it possible to shut off the pipes at PPB2 during short stops (if necessary). The return flow is taken out on the opposite side of the barrel where the connection to the patch panels is the same as on the inlet side. The tubes for the active gas are shown schematically in Figure 2. The detailed positioning of tubes will of course be adapted to the available space between the barrel and the first forward wheel.

Figure 2: Schematic of the tubes for the active gas in the barrel.

The ventilation gas (CO2) is fed in one separate line to each module from PPB1 (96 tubes from PPB1 to the barrel TRT). The same number of tubes goes from PPB1 to PPB2. The return flow of ventilation gas is taken out on the opposite side of the barrel with the same fan-out strategy. A schematic of the piping is shown in Figure 3.The detailed distribution principle may be reconsidered later but the total number of tubes will probably not change.

Figure 3: Schematic drawing of the ventilation of the radiator volume in the barrel.

For the straw water the three modules of a sector are connected in series (see Figure 4). The water first goes in through the tube at the corner of the first of the modules. On the opposite side (axially) of the module this tube is connected with the tube in the opposite corner (radially) of the same module. The flow then returns to the initial entry side where the tube is connected with the first tube in the next module. The same connection scheme is repeated module after module. At the innermost barrel module the return flow pipe comes out on the same side as the inflow pipe at the outer radius. To get a better balanced mass distribution and a better temperature uniformity the next azimuthal sector is fed from the opposite side of the barrel (see Figure 4) This means that there will be 32 tubes per side for the whole barrel (16 with inflow and 16 with outflow). Between PPB1 and PPB2 various fan-out options exist but the working hypothesis is to have the same number of tubes all the way.

Figure 4: Schematic of the cooling of the interior of the modules in the barrel.

or the electronics cooling two azimuthal sectors are serviced by one circuit. One tube comes in at the outer radius and continues to the inner radius where it returns through the same azimuthal sector. At the outer radius again the tube goes into the next azimuthal sector which is serviced in the same way as the first (see Figure 5). Finally the return flow goes from the outer radius of the barrel towards PPB1. In total there will be 32 tubes from the barrel to PPB1 (on each side, see Figure 5).

All piping for the barrel is summarised in table 1. A more detailed table for the barrel is shown in Appendix 1.

### Wheels

The wheels are also separated into 32 sectors for the active gas. At present these sectors are azimuthal but this may change later since an alternative proposal exists. However, it is not likely that the

The straw ventilation gas is fed in with one tube per group of wheel (2 tubes per group of wheel including the return flow conduit) from PPF1 (see Figure 8). From PPF1 to PPF2 the same number of

tubes are drawn. The flow conduits internally in the group of wheels is not described here. It is not yet possible to define exactly how the wheels are going to be grouped since it to a large extent is governed by the supports for the SCT. One possible grouping is to group the ventilation according to wheel type (A, B and C). A complementary, more schematic illustration, of the straw ventilation services is shown in Figure 9.

The electronics water for the forward wheels is also fed with one tube per wheel (see Figure 12). There will be a further distribution of water locally at the wheel level but this will not be treated here. An additional complementary description of the electronics services is shown in Figure 13.

An additional table with more information about the services for the TRT forward wheels is included at the end of this report in Appendix 2.

### Radiation length and weight of services

The radiation length for all fluid services is estimated and collected in Appendix 3. The maximum estimated value is 2.7 % at the end of the forward region. At the end of the barrel the value for the fluid services is 0.6 %. These values are about the same as for the cables (see Appendix 3) resulting in an overall radiation length for the TRT services (cables and fluids) of 5.5 % at the end of the forward region.

The total weight of the fluid services is 3 kg in the gap between barrel and forward, 35 kg on the wall of the cryostat and finally 50 kg on the squirrel cage surrounding the forward wheels. In combination with the weight of the cables this results in a weight of 10 kg in the gap between barrel and forward, 70 kg on the wall of the cryostat and 122 kg on the squirrel cage surrounding the forward wheels
