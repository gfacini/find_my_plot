###### Abstract

This note discusses the reconstruction of \(J/\psi\) and \(\Upsilon\) decays to electron pairs based on ATLAS Monte Carlo simulated signal and background samples. The possible trigger strategies are described, one geared to select two low-energy electromagnetic objects in direct production, the second one taking advantage of the possible presence of a muon in the final state in \(b\bar{b}\) production followed by the decay of one \(b\)-quark to \(J/\psi+X\). The low-energy electrons are reconstructed using a dedicated algorithm seeded by a track reconstructed in the inner detector and identified combining information from the inner detector and the electromagnetic calorimeter. The performance of this algorithm is presented and the potential of using such events for early LHC data studies is investigated.

Introduction

When switched on, the LHC will produce charm and beauty quarks in abundance which will be collected by the ATLAS experiment [1], even during the low luminosity periods. The number of produced quarkonium states such as J/\(\psi\) and \(\Upsilon\), important for many physics studies, will be equally numerous. On average, one in every hundred collisions will contain a \(b\bar{b}\) pair. The large \(b\bar{b}\) cross-section and the high luminosity of the machine give therefore a high rate for \(B\)-hadrons, making \(B\)-physics an interesting and competitive subject at the LHC. Low energy resonances, such as J/\(\psi\) and \(\Upsilon\) will be one of the main sources of isolated electrons in the early data. Both the J/\(\psi\) and \(\Upsilon\) signal samples are important for understanding the production of prompt quarkonia. But there is another aspect which is the main focus of this note: these samples are ideal to study the performances of trigger and offline reconstruction at low energies as well as being potentially useful for the in-situ calibration of the electromagnetic calorimeter.

This note is organised as follows: Section 2 gives a description of the data-samples used in this note, Section 3 details the trigger selections, and Section 4 describes the offline electron reconstruction and identification procedure. Finally, in Section 5, the physics potential of these channels is explored with initial data, assuming an instantaneous luminosity of \(10^{31}\) cm\({}^{-2}\) s\({}^{-1}\) and an integrated luminosity of 100 pb\({}^{-1}\).

## 2 Data samples

The different data samples used in this study are summarised in Table 1. The total cross-sections for charm production at LHC is 7.8 mb and the one for bottom production is 0.5 mb. Quarkonium production was originally described by the colour singlet model which failed to reproduce the direct J/\(\psi\) production cross section measured by the CDF experiment [2]. The colour octet model [3] was proposed as a solution to this quarkonium deficit. Direct quarkonia Monte Carlo samples comprise of directly produced J/\(\psi\) or \(\Upsilon\) in colour singlet and octet states, along with promptly-produced \(\chi\)'s, which decay into J/\(\psi\)'s or \(\Upsilon\)'s [4][5]. The inclusive production cross sections of J/\(\psi\) and \(\Upsilon\) are respectively \(\sim 90\mu\)b and \(\sim 0.7\mu\)b. A minimum transverse momentum of 3 GeV and a pseudo-rapidity \(\eta<\)2.7 are required for the two electrons. The resulting cross sections for the used data samples are respectively \(\sim 117\)nb and \(\sim 47\)nb. Another sample used in this study is originated from Drell-Yan production. In addition to the electron filter also applied to the J/\(\psi\) and \(\Upsilon\) samples, the generated di-electron invariant mass \(m_{ee}(DY)\) has to be \(1<m_{ee}(DY)<60\) GeV. Studies also include non-diffractive minimum-bias events with a total assumed cross section of 70 mb.

For the production via the decay of \(b\bar{b}\), only J/\(\psi\) events are considered. The signal sample is made of \(bB_{d}\rightarrow\mu(6)J/\psi(ee)+X\) events, where the \(\mu(6)\) refers to a muon coming from the \(b\) quark with a transverse momentum above 6 GeV. A minimum transverse momentum threshold of 2 GeV is applied to the generated electrons.

The simulated data have been produced for the ATLAS Computing System Commissioning [6]. All samples have been generated using the Pythia 6.403 [7] Monte Carlo event generator. More details on the Monte Carlo generators used can be found in [8]. Data have been simulated using GEANT4 [9], with the ATLAS software ATHENA [10], with a realistic geometry including material distortions in front of the electromagnetic calorimeter. Studies presented here correspond to very early data taking, with an initial luminosity of \(10^{31}\) cm\({}^{-2}\) s\({}^{-1}\). No pile-up has been included. Detailed information about these samples is given in Table 1.

Signal electrons come from \(J/\psi\) and \(\Upsilon\) decays2. The background electrons arise from other direct (\(b\to e\), \(c\to e\)) and cascade (\(b\to c\to e\)) semileptonic decays of meson with an electron in the final state and \(b\to\tau\to e^{-}\) decays3). Other background electrons arise from \(\pi^{0}\) Dalitz decays, \(\gamma\)-conversions occurring in the inner detector and decays of light hadrons. Distributions of generator level transverse momentum \(p_{T}\) and pseudorapidity \(\eta\) for electrons and pions are shown for the \(pp\to J/\psi\ (ee)+X\) sample on Fig. 1. The \(\eta\) distribution of electrons from conversion reflects the amount of material in front of the electromagnetic calorimeter. Ref. [13] details the reconstruction of such electrons. Table 2 gives the mean \(p_{T}\) for each population in the different samples.

Footnote 3): The corresponding branching ratios [12] are \(Br(b\to l^{-})=(10.71\pm 0.22)\%\), \(Br(b\to c\to l^{+})=(8.01\pm 0.18)\%\), \(Br(b\to\tilde{c}\to l^{-})=(1.62^{+0.44}_{-0.36})\%\), \(Br(b\to\tau\to e^{-})=(0.419\pm 0.055)\%\) and \(Br(b\to(J/\psi,\Upsilon)\to ee)=(0.072\pm 0.006)\%\).

Figure 2 shows the distance \(\Delta R\), at generator-level, between the two signal electrons from \(J/\psi\). On average, electrons from direct reconstructed J/\(\psi\)(c3e3) are separated by \(\Delta R=0.7\), and are restricted from being produced at separations larger than 1.1. Electrons from J/\(\psi\) originated from \(B\) hadrons on the contrary are on average more collimated, with a mean \(\Delta R=0.6\) and with a larger spread. In comparison, the higher mass of of \(\Upsilon\) requires the electrons to have a much larger opening angle, with a broad distribution in \(\Delta R\), the two electrons being almost back-to-back.

## 3 Trigger selection

### General requirements

ATLAS has a three level trigger system which reduces the 40 MHz bunch crossing rate to about 200 Hz to be recorded. The first level (L1) is a hardware-based trigger which makes a fast decision (in 2.5 \(\mu\)s)

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|} \hline Process & Cross section & Number of events (\(\times 10^{3}\)) \\ \hline \multicolumn{3}{|c|}{Direct production} \\ \hline \(pp\to J/\psi(e3e3)X\) & 116.3 nb & 160 \\ \(pp\to\Upsilon(e3e3)X\) & 47.6 nb & 150 \\ \(pp\to\) Drell-Yan(\(e3e3)\) & 2.9 nb & 250 \\ minimum-bias & 70 mb & 1,000 \\ \hline \multicolumn{3}{|c|}{\(b\bar{b}\) production} \\ \hline \(bB_{d}\to\mu(6)J/\psi(e2e2)X\) & 0.2 nb & 50 \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}

about which events are of interest for further processing, with a rate reduced down to below 40 kHz in its initial implementation. Coarse granularity information from the calorimeter and muon trigger systems are used at this stage of the trigger to identify regions of the detector which contain interesting signals corresponding to, for instance, electrons, muons, taus, and jets. These are called "Regions of Interest" (RoIs) and are used to guide the later stages of the trigger reconstruction. The high level trigger (HLT) is software-based and is split into two levels. At level 2 (L2) the full granularity of the detector is used to confirm the L1 signals and then to combine information from different sub-detectors within the RoIs identified at L1. Fast algorithms are used for the reconstruction at this stage and the rate is reduced to \(1-2\) kHz with an average execution time of about 40 ms. Lastly, at the event filter (EF), the whole event is available and "offline-like" algorithms are used along with better alignment and calibration information to form a final decision whether or not an event is accepted. With an execution time of about 4 s, the rate is reduced to 200 Hz.

The expected ATLAS trigger performance at an initial luminosity of \(10^{31}\) cm\({}^{-2}\) s\({}^{-1}\) is studied using the samples described in the previous section. Two trigger menus are considered here: the first is a purely electromagnetic menu which could be used only for early data taking; the second menu relies on the \(B\)-trigger and could be extended for data taking at low luminosity \(10^{33}\) cm\({}^{-2}\) s\({}^{-1}\). More details about the overall trigger strategy, in particular for these channels, can be obtained in [14] and [15].

### Electron selection

J/\(\psi\to ee\) and \(\Upsilon\to ee\) events are very demanding for the trigger system. Due to their relatively low masses, the electrons produced in the J/\(\psi\) and \(\Upsilon\) decays are very soft. Figure 3 shows the distribution of the transverse momentum of the less energetic electron versus the transverse momentum of the most energetic electron in J/\(\psi\) (left) and \(\Upsilon\) (right) decays [5]. This poses a huge challenge for the L1 calorimeter trigger. Its performance at the low-energy end is limited by the noise of typically 0.5 GeV per RoI and a

\end{table}

Figure 2: Distance \(\Delta R\) at generator-level between the two signal electrons for direct \(J/\psi\) events (top left), direct \(\Upsilon\) (top right) and \(J/\psi\) from b decays (bottom).

3 GeV threshold is the limit of what is feasible for the L1 trigger. The 6.5 kHz L1 output rate for 2EM3 (corresponding to two L1 electromagnetic clusters greater than 3 GeV ) makes it one of the biggest consumers of the total bandwidth [14]. The strategy to trigger on J/\(\psi\) and \(\Upsilon\to ee\) events is based on low \(E_{T}\) L1 electromagnetic RoIs and further electron identification using calorimeter and inner detector information at the HLT. The inner detector tracks are reconstructed in regions of half-size \(\Delta\eta\times\Delta\varphi\ =\ 0.1\ \times\ 0.1\) around these electromagnetic RoIs.

Figure 4 shows the distribution of the invariant mass of the pairs of electrons for signal and background events after the L1 selection. The J/\(\psi\) and \(\Upsilon\) samples can be easily recognised by the resonance peaks. Table 3 gives the number of events which are expected to pass the L1 selection. The L1 trigger efficiency is calculated with respect to the number of generated events, which in particular include a requirement on the minimum transverse momentum of 3 GeV on each electron as detailed in Section2. The selected events are in the tail of the J/\(\psi\) distribution (see Figure 3). Additionally the requirement of \(E_{T}>3\) GeV at L1 implies \(E_{T}>=4\) GeV thus starting to cut into the peak of the \(\Upsilon\) distribution. The efficiency of this level is measured to be 27% for J/\(\psi\) and \(\Upsilon\) events. About 43% of Drell-Yan events pass the L1 in the generated mass range. A total of \(4.2\times 10^{6}\) J/\(\psi\)\(\rightarrow\)ee, \(1.2\times 10^{6}\)\(\Upsilon\rightarrow\)ee and \(0.12\times 10^{6}\) Drell-Yan events are expected after this level.

For the minimum bias sample, the enhancement above 6 GeV arises from the requirement of the presence of two L1 clusters with energy greater than 3 GeV. Studies and implementation of an efficient

For signal events the efficiency \(\varepsilon\) is given as well as the number of expected events. For background the rate is provided. Quoted errors are statistical only.

HLT selection, based on the selection of two electrons with \(E_{T}>\) 5 GeV (2e5 menu) is ongoing. Typical rates are expected to be \(\sim\) 40 Hz at L2 and 6 Hz at EF.

### \(B\)-physics

The \(B\)-trigger is expected to account for 5-10% of the total ATLAS trigger resources. The trigger for \(B\)-physics is initiated by a single- or a di-muon selection at L1. At 10\({}^{31}\) cm\({}^{-2}\) s\({}^{-1}\), a threshold \(p_{T}>\) 4 GeV will be used, rising to about 6 GeV at 10\({}^{33}\) cm\({}^{-2}\) s\({}^{-1}\) to match the rate capabilities of the HLT. For final states such as the \(bB_{d}\rightarrow\mu(6)J/\psi X\) events, inner detector tracks are combined to reconstruct the J/\(\psi\) particles. Two different strategies are used for finding the tracks, depending on luminosity [16]. At 10\({}^{31}\) cm\({}^{-2}\) s\({}^{-1}\) full reconstruction over the whole inner detector can be performed, since the L1 muon rate is comparatively modest, while at higher luminosities reconstruction will be limited to L1 electromagnetic RoIs with \(E_{T}>\) 3 GeV. For the \(bB_{d}\rightarrow\mu(6)J/\psi X\) events the L1 trigger efficiency is \(\sim\) 88%. This latter approach has lower efficiency for selecting the signal but requires fewer HLT resources for a fixed L1 rate. If one combines triggers for electromagnetic final states and pre-scaled single muon-triggers needed for trigger efficiency measurements, the overall rate for \(B\)-physics triggers is approximately 20 Hz at 10\({}^{31}\) cm\({}^{-2}\) s\({}^{-1}\).

## 4 Electron reconstruction and identification

The standard electron reconstruction procedure [17], optimised for high energetic electrons, is based on calorimeter clusters to which tracks are associated in a second step. An alternative procedure will be used for the reconstruction of electrons originated from J/\(\Psi\) and \(\Upsilon\) decays. It takes full advantage of the tracking capabilities of the inner detector as well as the granularity of the electromagnetic calorimeter. The method is seeded by a track which is extrapolated into the electromagnetic calorimeter and allows for efficient reconstruction of electrons in jets for \(b\)-tagging purpose (cf. [18]) and very low \(p_{T}\) electrons.

### Electron reconstruction

The track-based algorithm could handle any charged track particles with a transverse momentum greater than 0.5 GeV. Still, as it will be detailed further, in order to reduce the amount of fake candidates, in

Figure 4: Expected differential cross section for low-mass electron pairs using the 2EM3 trigger menu item after L1 selection for J/\(\psi\) decays (dotted histogram), \(\Upsilon\) decays (dashed histogram), Drell-Yan production (solid histogram) and expected background (full circles). The invariant mass is reconstructed with calorimeter only information available at L1.

particular in jets, only particles with \(p_{T}>2\) GeV are considered. The inner detector coverage goes to pseudorapidity values up to 2.5, except for the transition radiation tracker (TRT) which extends up to 2. This subdetector being crucial nonetheless in the identification procedure but also to preselect tracks, the electron reconstruction is limited to \(|\eta|<2\). Strict selection criteria, similar to the \(b\)-tagging ones, are required to have at least nine precision hits (pixel and silicon detectors); at least two hits in the pixel detector and at least one hit in the vertexing layer. The TRT plays a central role in electron identification. Selection criteria are thus required to have at least 20 hits in the TRT and at least one high energy hit (HTR hit) in the TRT detector along the track. After these criteria, only 50% of initial tracks remain. All the tracks that pass these criteria are extrapolated [19] to the second sampling of the electromagnetic calorimeter. Around this position a cluster of size \(\Delta\eta\times\Delta\phi=0.075\times 0.125\) (\(3\times 5\) in units of cells in the middle sampling) in the barrel and \(\Delta\eta\times\Delta\phi=0.125\times 0.125\) (\(5\times 5\)) in the end-caps is built. The cell with the maximum energy is searched within a small \(\eta\) and \(\phi\) window, \(0.075\times 0.075\) in the middle layer, around the extrapolation point. Shower shapes are estimated with respect to this position.

Since the algorithm is the same as for the reconstruction of electrons in jets [18], a set of _preselection_ criteria are applied to decrease the number of fake candidates:

* the fraction of energy reconstructed in the core of the shower in the first sampling \(E_{1}({\rm core})/E>\)0.03;
* the fraction of energy reconstructed in the core of the shower in the third sampling \(E_{3}({\rm core})/E<\)0.5;
* the ratio of the energy \(E\) reconstructed in the electromagnetic calorimeter over the momentum \(p\) reconstructed in the inner detector \(E/p>\)0.7.

The above selection rejects about 5% of signal electrons but also ensures that the shower shapes in the first sampling are correctly defined. Finally, candidates which are also reconstructed as originating from a conversion [13] are vetoed, corresponding to a loss of 1-3% of signal electrons and pions.

By fitting electron tracks in such a way as to allow for bremsstrahlung, it is possible to improve the reconstructed track parameters, as shown in Fig. 5 on the ratio between the reconstructed and the true momentum for electrons. These algorithms rely exclusively on the inner detector information. The method of dynamic-noise-adjustment extrapolates track segments to the next silicon layer. If it finds a significant \(\chi^{2}\) contribution, compatible with an energy loss by the track due to bremsstrahlung, the fraction of radiated energy is estimated and a corresponding additional noise term is included in the Kalman filter [1][20].

Position and energy corrections are applied in the precise reconstruction of the electromagnetic cluster and are described in [21]. These corrections have been tuned for high energy clusters and are not optimal for low energy electrons. Moreover, they have been determined with electron samples simulated with a detector taken to be perfectly aligned. In Fig. 5 the ratio between the reconstructed and the true energy is shown as a function of \(|\eta|\) for signal electrons from \(J/\psi\) samples. It can be seen that these corrections over-estimate the electron energy except in the crack region where the effect of extra-material in front of the calorimeter is important. Work is on going to improve the energy reconstruction at low energy.

By default the four-momentum of an electron is defined as the energy reconstructed in the calorimeter, whereas direction is taken from the associated track. As in this note the main physics processes result in electron transverse momenta of less than 15 GeV, the tracker momentum is used instead of the energy unless stated otherwise. Future developments in ATLAS will ensure an optimal combination of calorimeter and tracker measurements in the energy definition.

### Electron identification

The most common background processes for producing electron-like showers in the calorimeters were described in section 2. Because the development of showers is different for electrons and hadrons, the electron identification algorithm incorporates variables that describe the shower shapes, quality of the match between the track and its corresponding cluster and the fraction of high threshold hits in the transition radiation tracker.

#### 4.2.1 Identification of isolated electrons

The identification for isolated electrons is based on cuts on the shower shapes, on information from the reconstructed tracks and on the combined reconstruction [17]. To be consistent with the trigger selection, only particles having a transverse energy \(E_{T}>5\) GeV are considered in the following. Three levels of selection are available:

* "loose", consisting of simple shower-shape cuts (longitudinal leakage, shower shape in the middle layer of the electromagnetic calorimeter) and very loose matching cuts between reconstructed tracks and calorimeter clusters;
* "medium", which adds shower shape cuts making use of the important information contained in the first layer of the electromagnetic calorimeter and track-quality cuts; and
* "tight", with tighter track matching criteria and the cut on the energy-to-momentum ratio. This selection also explicitly requires the presence of a vertexing-layer hit on the track (to further reject photon conversions) and a large ratio of high-threshold to low-threshold hits in the TRT detector (to further reject the background from charged hadrons). Additionally, further isolation of the electron may be required by using calorimeter energy isolation beyond the cluster itself. Two sets of tight selection cuts are used to estimate the overall performance of the electron identification. They are labeled as "tight(TRT)", in the case where a TRT cut with approximately 90% efficiency for electrons is applied, and as "tight(isol)", in the case where a TRT cut with approximately 95% efficiency is applied in combination with a calorimeter isolation cut.

The discriminating variables show a significant dependence on the pseudorapidity and a less pronounced one on the transverse momentum. In \(\eta\) the dependence corresponds to varying granularities, lead thickness and material in front of the electromagnetic calorimeter. The separation between the distributions obtained for electrons and pions can vary also with \(\eta\). The thresholds applied for cuts have been optimised in five \(\eta\) bins, (0,0.8), (0.8,1.37), (1.37,1.52), (1.52,1.8), (1.8,2.0), and for transverse energies below 7.5 GeV, between 7.5 and 15 GeV and above 15 GeV.

Figure 5: Left : ratio of the reconstructed to true momentum for electrons, for the default Kalman filter (hatched histogram) and for bremsstrahlung recovery algorithm (plain histogram) in the J/\(\psi\) samples. Right : ratio of the reconstructed to true energy versus \(\eta\) for electrons.

The electron identification efficiency is defined as \(\varepsilon_{e}=N_{e}^{t}/N_{e}\), where \(N_{e}\) is the number of signal electron tracks, which pass the track cuts and \(N_{e}^{t}\) is the number of signal electrons which pass identification cuts. The charged pion rejection is defined as \(R_{\pi}~{}=~{}N_{\pi}/N_{\pi}^{t}\), where \(N_{\pi}\) is the number of _good quality_ pion tracks and \(N_{\pi}^{t}\) is the number of _good quality_ pion tracks misidentified as signal electrons. Table 4 shows the electron identification efficiency and pion rejection factor after loose, medium, tight with no isolation requirement and tight selections for the different data samples. For tight selection the efficiency is \(\varepsilon_{e}\sim 65\%\) for direct J/\(\psi\) production. Performance is similar for the \(\Upsilon\) sample, despite the higher average momentum of the signal electrons, due to the cut on \(E_{T}>5\) GeV.

Figure 6 shows in more detail the overall reconstruction and identification performance: the \(p_{T}\) and \(\eta\) dependences of the efficiencies for electrons. There is still an important \(\eta\) dependence due to a few discriminating variables and work is ongoing to improve it.

#### 4.2.2 Identification of electrons from \(b\) quark

Another identification procedure is optimised for non-isolated electrons and is thus particularly useful for \(b\bar{b}\) events. The trigger anticipated for these events is based on a muonic decay mode of either the \(b\) or the \(\bar{b}\) quark. All good quality tracks are considered above a transverse momentum \(p_{T}>\)2 GeV. When possible we use the same variables as for the isolated electron identification but some variables - like the hadronic leakage by the fraction of energy reconstructed in the third sampling - are replaced or only the core of the electromagnetic shower is used. In addition to the traditional cut-based analysis, multivariate techniques have been developed, based on the similar variables, and in particular a likelihood

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|} \hline Selection & \multicolumn{2}{|c|}{\(pp\to J/\psi X\)} & \multicolumn{2}{|c|}{\(pp\to\Upsilon X\)} \\ \hline  & \(\varepsilon_{e}\) (\%) & \(R_{\pi}\) & \(\varepsilon_{e}\) (\%) & \(R_{\pi}\) \\ \hline Loose & 84.3 \(\pm\) 0.1 & 36 \(\pm\) 3 & 83.7 \(\pm\) 0.4 & 32 \(\pm\) 7 \\ \hline Medium & 78.4 \(\pm\) 0.1 & 72 \(\pm\) 9 & 78.4 \(\pm\) 0.4 & 49 \(\pm\) 13 \\ \hline Tight(TRT) & 71.4 \(\pm\) 0.1 & 109 \(\pm\) 17 & 71.3 \(\pm\) 0.4 & 57 \(\pm\) 16 \\ \hline Tight (isol) & 65.5 \(\pm\) 0.1 & 900 \(\pm\) 400 & 66.1 \(\pm\) 0.5 & 740 \(\pm\) 300 \\ \hline \end{tabular}

technique can also be used. Figure 7 shows the obtained pion rejection curve as a function of the electron identification efficiency.

In the following the working point is an electron identification efficiency of 80%, corresponding to a pion rejection factor of \(\sim 1300\). Figure 8 shows the overall reconstruction and identification performance in more details: the \(p_{T}\) and \(\eta\) dependencies of the efficiencies are shown for electrons.

## 5 Expected physics studies for early data

### Number of expected events

As described in section 3, for an initial luminosity of \(10^{31}\) cm\({}^{-2}\) s\({}^{-1}\), the trigger seelction of two low energy electrons (2EM3 menu at level 1) should provide good statistics for J/\(\psi\to ee\) and \(\Upsilon\to ee\) decays. Fig. 9 shows the expected differential cross-section for low-mass electron pairs using the 2EM3 trigger menu item and the offline selection in linear (left) and log (right) scale. The invariant mass is reconstructed with direction taken from the inner detector and energy from the electromagnetic calorimeter

which allows a better reconstruction of the invariant mass than using calorimeter only information as done at level 1.

The signal-to-background ratio obtained is greater than one at the J/\(\psi\) and \(\Upsilon\) peaks. With an integrated luminosity of 100 pb\({}^{-1}\) and an efficient identification and reconstruction of these low-mass pairs, approximately two hundred thousand J/\(\psi\) decays could be extracted (see table 5).

Moreover, the standard \(B\)-physics trigger, using a single muon above a threshold of \(p_{T}>4\) GeV, can give access to a sample of \(J/\psi\) events originating from the \(b\bar{b}\) production, without possible bias on the selection of electromagnetic objects. Due to its lower cross-section, the expected number of events is much less, around \(2.3\times 10^{3}\) after offline selection and \(\sim 1.9\times 10^{3}\) after trigger and offline selection, but without any selection on the electrons themselves. A better estimation of this number requires combining a single muon trigger with a trigger for electromagnetic final states as described in section 3.3.

### Quality of the mass reconstruction with initial data

In this section, we study the offline reconstruction of the J/\(\psi\) and \(\Upsilon\) particles from their decay products. After a short description of the algorithm, we study the performance of the reconstruction for \(J/\psi\)s originating from the \(b\bar{b}\) decays. The invariant mass has been reconstructed with the inner detector only, combining information from the inner detector and the electromagnetic calorimeter, and using only the

latter information. For the reconstruction with inner detector information we present results with and without the bremsstrahlung recovery procedure included. For direct production of J/\(\psi\) and \(\Upsilon\), we only show results using mass reconstruction with the inner detector.

#### 5.2.1 Reconstruction of \(J/\psi\) and \(\Upsilon\) events

The identification of electrons is performed using the electron reconstruction algorithm described above. Electrons are identified with either the "tight" cuts for isolated electrons, or based on the likelihood method tuned to an electron identification efficiency of 80%. Pairs of electrons are thus selected. These pairs define the overall detection efficiency of J/\(\psi\) (or \(\Upsilon\)) events which is the product of the losses due to the removal of clusters located in the crack in the electromagnetic calorimeter, the track quality cuts, and the electron identification efficiency.

Pairs of reconstructed opposite-charge tracks are fitted to a common vertex. Only events with a quality of the fit with \(\chi^{2}\) per degree of freedom \(<6\) are retained. Figure 10 shows the distribution of the reconstructed transverse decay length \(L_{xy}\) for direct J/\(\psi\) events and events originated from \(B\) hadrons decay. It is defined as: \(L_{xy}=\frac{\bar{D}\cdot\bar{p}_{T}(J/\psi)}{||\bar{p}_{T}(J/\psi)||}\), where \(D\) is the distance between the primary and secondary vertices and \(p_{T}(J/\psi)\) is the J/\(\psi\) reconstructed transverse momentum. It is used to distinguish between the prompt J/\(\psi\), which have a pseudo-proper time of zero (\(L_{xy}<0.4\) mm), and \(B\)-hadron decays into J/\(\psi\)+X having an exponentially decaying pseudo-proper time distribution due to the non-zero lifetime of the parent \(B\)-hadrons (\(L_{xy}>0.25\) mm).

#### 5.2.2 Reconstruction of \(J/\psi\) from \(b\bar{b}\) decays

After selection, only \(\sim\)2000 events are reconstructed. This statistics is scaled to \(1.9\times 10^{3}\) events, corresponding to the expected statistics for an integrated luminosity of 100 \(pb^{-1}\).

**Reconstruction in the inner detector:**

Fig. 11 shows the electron pair invariant mass distribution using only the inner detector information for signal events. The fitted function behaves as a Breit-Wigner distribution \(\sim\Gamma/(\Delta m_{0}^{2}+(\Gamma/2)^{2})\) to the left of the peak \(m_{0}\), and as a Gaussian of width \(\sigma_{\rm right}\) to the right, as shown in Fig. 11.

The parameter \(\sigma_{\rm right}\) characterises the effective resolution in the invariant mass distribution of the pair, while \(\Gamma\) is a measure of the intensity of energy loss by the electrons due to the bremsstrahlung. \(\Delta m_{0}=m_{0}-M_{J/\psi}\), where \(M_{J/\psi}=3096\) MeV is the nominal J/\(\psi\) mass. The fitted values of the parameters are shown in Table 6. The J/\(\psi\) reconstruction performance is assessed separately for the three cases: TRT

barrel, when both electrons have their track pseudorapidity \(|\eta|<0.7\), the TRT end-caps, when at least one electron has \(|\eta|>0.7\), and the full \(\eta\) range.

In general the quality of the fit is not very high, in particular we see difficulties with correctly reproducing the peak. Table 6 shows the results of the fit of the invariant mass. A shift in the reconstructed mass is measured around 77 MeV, larger in the end-caps than in the barrel. As mentioned in [5], such mass shifts may be due to detector alignment, material effects, magnetic field scale and its stability. The CDF collaboration extensively and successfully used this method but it took many years at the Tevatron to collect sufficient statistics to allow for the disentanglement of various detector effects [22]. The parameter \(\Gamma\) is around 550 MeV. The Gaussian width, estimated from the right part of the distribution is around 67 MeV. One can also notice the improvement in the mass reconstruction from bremsstrahlung recovery. Without any bremsstrahlung recovery, only 47% of events are reconstructed within \(\pm\) 200 MeV of the nominal \(J/\psi\) mass, whereas with the use of the bremsstrahlung recovery, this fraction increases to approximately 55% for the dynamic-noise-adjustment algorithm.

Results are shown without (crosses) and with (bullets) bremsstrahlung recovery included. Selection of events includes L1 trigger and offline and number of events is scaled to 100 \(pb^{-1}\).

**Combined reconstruction:**

The J/\(\psi\) mass can be also determined combining information from the inner detector and the electromagnetic calorimeter. The energy is taken from the electromagnetic calorimeter and the direction from the more accurate measurements provided by the inner detector, taking into account the bremsstrahlung recovery procedure.

Figure 12 shows the di-electron invariant mass distribution obtained from the signal sample only. An asymmetric gaussian function is fitted, with different width, \(\sigma_{\rm left}\) and \(\sigma_{\rm right}\), either side of the fitted peak mass \(m_{0}\). It is performed in a narrow mass interval, between 2.5 and 3.6 GeV. The parameter \(\sigma_{\rm right}\) characterises the effective resolution in the invariant mass, while \(\sigma_{\rm left}\) is a measure of the deterioration of this resolution due to bremsstrahlung. The fitted values of the parameters are shown in Table 7. Performance is assessed separately for the three cases: TRT barrel, when both electrons have their track pseudorapidity \(|\eta|<0.7\), the TRT end-caps, when at least one electron has \(|\eta|>0.7\), and the full \(\eta\) range. The resolution obtained is highly asymmetric, \(\sim~{}387\) MeV on the left and \(\sim~{}189\) MeV on the right. It can be also noticed that the quality of the fit is rather poor.

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|} \hline \(\eta\) & \(\Delta m_{0}\) (MeV) & \(\sigma_{\rm left}\) (MeV) & \(\sigma_{\rm right}\) (MeV) \\ \hline All & \(101\pm 14\) & \(327\pm 12\) & \(189\pm 11\) \\ Barrel & \(94\pm 16\) & \(285\pm 12\) & \(183\pm 12\) \\ End-caps & \(113\pm 28\) & \(385\pm 27\) & \(191\pm 21\) \\ \hline \end{tabular}

**Reconstruction in the electromagnetic calorimeter:**

Finally it is interesting to investigate the performance if we rely only on the information from the electromagnetic calorimeter. Fig. 13 shows the electron candidates invariant mass distribution obtained from the signal sample only. The same function defined for the combined reconstruction is used to fit the distributions.

The fitted values of the parameters are shown in Table 8. Performance is assessed separately in three cases: the barrel region of the electromagnetic calorimeter, when both electrons have their pseudorapidity \(|\eta|<1.4\); the end-cap region, when at least one electron has \(|\eta|>1.4\); and for the full \(\eta\) range. The resolution obtained from the width of the Gaussian is \(\sim 550\) MeV.

#### 5.2.3 Reconstruction of direct \(\mathbf{J/\psi}\) and \(\Upsilon\) events

After selection, only \(\sim\)4000 events are reconstructed. This statistics is scaled to \(2.3\times 10^{5}\) events, corresponding to the expected statistics for an integrated luminosity of 100 \(pb^{-1}\). Figure 14 shows the electron pair invariant mass distribution using only the inner detector information. The same function as defined previously is fitted.

The fitted values of the parameters \(\Delta m_{0}\), \(\Gamma\) and \(\sigma_{\rm right}\) are shown in Table 9. The fitted mass value is shifted by about 100 MeV, the \(\Gamma\) factor is \(\sim 300\) MeV and the resolution term is \(\sim 70\) MeV.

#### 5.2.4 \(\Upsilon\) reconstruction

After selection, only \(\sim\)1000 events are reconstructed. This statistics is scaled to \(4.3\times 10^{4}\) events, corresponding to the expected statistics for an integrated luminosity of 100 pb\({}^{-1}\). Fig. 15 shows the electron pair invariant mass distribution from the inner detector information.

The fitted values of the parameters are shown in Table 10. The fitted mass value is shifted by about 180 MeV, the \(\Gamma\) factor is \(\sim\) 1 GeV and the resolution term is \(\sim\) 140 MeV.

### Assessment of performance in situ with initial data

Initial studies have been performed for the J/\(\psi\to ee\) tag-and-probe method briefly outlined below, using events satisfying a single electron trigger with \(E_{T}>5\) GeV. Due to too high rate at L1 (40 kHz) it has to be pre-scaled by a factor of 60, which reduces the final statistics. Those events are used to look for an opposite-charge electron pair identified by the offline electron reconstruction with an invariant mass near the \(J/\psi\) peak. Using the second electron as the probe which was not required to pass any trigger

An asymmetric fit is performed with a function which behaves as a Breit-Wigner distribution to the left of the peak and as a Gaussian to the right of the peak. Selection of events includes L1 trigger, offline and a cut on \(E_{T}>5\) GeV for each electron to mimic the HLT. The number of events is scaled to 100 pb\({}^{-1}\).

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|} \hline \(\eta\) & \(\Delta m_{0}\) (MeV) & \(\Gamma\) (MeV) & \(\sigma_{\rm right}\) (MeV) \\ \hline All & -98 \(\pm\) 1 & 298 \(\pm\) 2 & 71 \(\pm\) 1 \\ Barrel & -77 \(\pm\) 1 & 255 \(\pm\) 2 & 62 \(\pm\) 1 \\ End-caps & -142 \(\pm\) 2 & 354 \(\pm\) 3 & 87 \(\pm\) 2 \\ \hline \end{tabular}

selection, the efficiency (relative to the offline selection) of a given trigger signature can be measured. We expect to collect of the order of \(\approx 20\times 10^{3}\)\(J/\psi\) signal events after the pre-scale with an integrated luminosity of 100 \(pb^{-1}\). Similar studies could be performed to study the offline electron selection.

One important ingredient in the calibration strategy for the electromagnetic calorimeter is the use of large statistics samples of \(Z\to ee\) decays to perform an accurate inter-calibration of regions with a fixed size of \(\Delta\eta\times\Delta\varphi=0.2\times 0.4\). To cross-check the calibration obtained from the \(Z^{0}\) decays and also to check the linearity of the calorimeter, it is important to have calibration coefficients for a lower electron energy range, which can be obtained using the J/\(\psi\to ee\) and \(\Upsilon\to ee\) decays as shown in [23]. With the expected statistics, a statistical precision of \(\sim 0.6\%\) can be expected on the inter-calibration of the electromagnetic calorimeter based on 100 \(pb^{-1}\). Still, more studies are needed in particular to improve the energy reconstruction and to disentangle effects of inter-calibration with the distribution of material in front of the electromagnetic calorimeter.

More generally, these electron samples will allow us to study the performance of both the reconstruction of tracks in the inner detector and clusters in the electromagnetic calorimeter, as well as the

alignment between these two detectors. All these studies are crucial for the very first measurements (such as, for example cross-section measurements) to be performed by the ATLAS experiment on the early data.

## 6 Conclusion

In this note, the strategy to reconstruct J/\(\psi\) and \(\Upsilon\) particles, decaying into electron-positron pairs, has been investigated. The possible trigger strategies have also been described. For initial luminosities of \(10^{31}\) cm\({}^{-2}\) s\({}^{-1}\), a trigger on low-energy di-electron pairs (2EM3 at L1) should provide good statistics for the direct production of these particles. Moreover the standard \(B\)-physics trigger, using a single muon above a certain \(p_{T}\) threshold can give access to these events through the \(b\bar{b}\) production, without biasing the selection of electromagnetic objects. For these studies, the electron reconstruction seeded by a track in the inner detector has been used. Compared to previous studies, the main improvement comes from the identification procedure, which can either use the standard cut-based analysis, with thresholds tuned at low energy, or a dedicated identification developed for non-isolated electrons. The signal-to-background ratio obtained is larger than one at the J/\(\psi\) and \(\Upsilon\) peaks, but the extraction of the Drell-Yan signal requires further studies. With an integrated luminosity of 100 \(pb^{-1}\) and an efficient identification and reconstruction of these low-mass pairs, approximately two hundred thousand J/\(\psi\) decays could be isolated for detailed studies of the electron identification and reconstruction performance, in particular in terms of matching energy and momentum measurements at a scale quite different from that of the more commonly used \(Z\to ee\) decays.
