The Forward SCT layout was recently subject to discussion in the SCT community, and a new Forward Layout [1] was approved by the ATLAS SCT Institute Board on November 8, 1998. Several layouts are proposed which save one inner ring of silicon detectors, without significant degradation of the detector performance.

Following an initial presentation of the contents of this note, we were requested by the SCT community to provide a final detector design for all rings of the Forward detector. This has been done, and is shown to give a (marginally) improved performance.

## 1 Introduction and Summary.

The TDR Forward SCT layout [2] was recently replaced as the baseline by a new layout [1], approved by the SCT Institute Board on November 8, 1998. This new baseline layout (NB), which was optimized by requirements of track hermeticity and recommended by the SCT Steering Group, was motivated by

* a slightly increased inner active radius for the forward disks, required by the pixel forward disk locations,
* a total (outer module to outer module) disk thickness of 34mm, stated to be the minimum guaranteed for engineering reasons (cooling pipe and block routing),
* forward interface, and tiling effects.

A consequence of the new layout was a re-design of the inner and middle detector dimensions (the W11, W21 and W22 detectors), and the addition of one complete inner module ring on wheel #2. For a marginal deterioration of detector hermeticity, which is small compared with the effect of bonding gaps, the additional inner module ring can be avoided, with consequent cost and material advantages. The pattern recognition properties of a new suggested layout are also slightly improved, because of a more regular wheel spacing.

In Section 2, we describe the new base-line (NB) layout, and we show the location of both gaps and overlaps within individual wheels of the layout. We show that the overlapping space-points created by tracks traversing modules of an individual wheel are significant, suggesting that a more optimised wheel and wafer design may be desirable. Because bonding gaps were not considered during optimization (which was on the basis of hermeticity) the NB layout introduced an additional inner ring.

In Section 3 we compare the NB layout with an alternative layout that uses the same detector, module and wheel geometry as for the NB layout, but does not include the additional inner ring. We conclude that, although there is a slight deterioration of performance, the benefit of an additional inner ring cannot be justified.

In Section 4, we return to the TDR layout. Assuming a disk thickness of 31 mm, we have retained the TDR detector designs, and have slightly shifted the module positions on each disk to maintain a radial overlap. We show the space point distribution of hits on the wheels, and we present a layout (called NEW-B) using the original detectors that fulfils the SCT tracker specifications.

The detector design of Section 4 is viable, and could be justified for slightly larger disk thicknesses. The layout was presented to the SCT IB in March 1999. It was noted that none of the above designs were optimal, and in particular that module overlaps significantly exceeded the design specifications of 1%. The SCT IB instructed the authors to return with revised active detector dimensions for _all_ forward modules. Two new wheel designs - designated NEW-C and NEW-D - are described in Section 5. In the NEW-C design, all detectors are re-optimised, and in the design NEW-D, detectors of the inner and middle rings are re-optimised. The difference in performance is marginal. Each of the layouts NEW-B, NEW-C or NEW-D are feasible, and the SCT SG has been presented with the results in order to make an informed decision based on a performance - schedule - financial trade-off.

## 2 New Baseline (NB)Layout and Wheel Geometry.

Figure 0-1 shows the New Baseline (NB) layout, as approved by the SCT Institute Board. Table 1 shows the z-positions of each wheel, and compares the wheel positions to those of the TDR layout.

Table 2 shows the radial position of each detector type on the wheel in the NB layout, and the active detector dimensions.

The layout differs from that of the TDR in the following respects:

* the addition of an inner module ring on disk #2, 'to improve the detector hermeticity',
* a disk thickness of 34 mm (outer module to outer module) which necessitates new detector designs for the inner and middle module rings (the TDR layout assumed a 26 mm gap)

Table 2: Active detector radial positions and dimensions for the NB layout, and in brackets for the TDR layout. The bond gap is assumed to be 2.1 mm for the NB layout. An active angular strip coverage of 0.209 mrad has been assumed for the inner and middle rings, and 0.1615 mrad for the outer rings.

* a bonding gap of 2.1mm, compared with the TDR design of 2.2 mm,
* a very short separation between the disks #1 and #2, which is undesirable,
* a reduced \(\,|\eta\,|\,\) coverage, partly resulting from the constraints of a revised TRT envelope (including the disk #9 position)

In order to assess the hermeticity of individual full disks in the NB layout, a total of \(10^{7}\) straight tracks were generated uniformly in the range \(1.0<\,|\eta\,|\,<2.5\). A Gaussian vertex spread with \(\,\sigma\) = 5.6 cm was assumed. The exact (active) detector geometry and position was described by the program. The barrel radius was assumed to that of the most outer silicon modules (the most pessimistic case). Hits were generated in detector elements traversed by each track, and space points were formed using the radial and stereo layers if

* back-to-back stereo detectors recorded hits enabling a space point evaluation with- in a given module,
* an R-\(\Phi\) hit of one module, and a stereo hit of an adjacent module on the same side of the disk, allowed the creation of a space point (these are called '\(\Phi\)-overlap space points').

Figure 2 shows the distribution of space points reconstructed in a quadrant of wheel 6. The distribution of space points is uniform. Radial lines indicate some evidence for module overlaps, and a heavy band at R \(\sim\) 45 cm corresponds to the overlap of the central and outer modules. This band is artificially accentuated by the z-offset for which each space point is evaluated. A depletion of space points at R-40 cm and R \(\sim\) 51 cm correspond to _bond gaps_ in the middle and outer modules respectively. The depletion of space points at R \(\sim\) 35 cm will be shown to be artificial, because of the z-offsets of the inner and middle modules. It is finally possible to evidence the trapezoid shape of the detectors, and the effect of the stereo detectors.

Figures 2-2 a) and 2-2 b) show the impact point of tracks for which no space point is reconstructed, in respectively wheels #1 and #6. While the dense inner and external bands are artificial from the known limits of wheel acceptance, band gaps for the middle and outer modules are pronounced. As in the case of barrel modules, Table 3 shows that typically 1.7% of all tracks within the wheel acceptance have no space point. Of this number only 0.05% (0.01%) of all space points lost are due to module gaps within respectively wheels #1 and #6. In pr evious optimization of the overlap on the basis of hermeticity, no account was taken of the bond gap, which is the _dominant_ reason for the loss of space points within a wheel.

Figures 2-2 c) and 2-2 d), and Table 3 show the reconstructed space-point _overlaps_ within a quadrant of the wheel, again for the extreme cases of Wheels #1 and #6 in the NB layout.

The specification which we assume is an overlap of 1% for alignment purposes, and hermeticity for prompt tracks of \(\rm p_{T}\) > 1 GeV/c. In the least favourable case (wheel #1), the overlap required to maintain hermeticity at the outer radius of the outer (middle) rings is respectively 560 \(\rm\upmu m\) (374 \(\rm\upmu m\)). This corresponds to 6.2 (3.9) strips. The required overlap for hermeticity is reduced by a factor \(\sim\) 3 for wheel #9.

Figures c) and d) show, for the same wheels, events for which there are overlaps between modules [3].This plot includes the event category for which there are \(\dagger\)- overlap space points’.

The alignment requirement implies an overlap on each side of the detector of 1.24 mrad (0.62 mrad) for the outer ring and 1.605 mrad (0.805 mrad) for the middle ring, depending on whether the total overlap, or the overlap on each side, is assumed to be 1%. The actual overlap on each side for the NB layout is 1.601 mrad (outer ring) and 1.716 mrad (middle ring). A 0.5% overlap on each edge of the module is over-kill on the basis of rate.

In Figures 2-3 a) through 2-3 d), and again in Table 3, the _same_ plots are shown in the \(|\eta|\) range 1.0 < \(|\eta|\) < 2.47, when '\(\Phi\)-overlap space points' are not permitted. As can be seen some azimuthal gaps do result, at the level of \(\sim\) 10% of that due to bond gaps. For completeness, Table 4 shows, with the NB disk layout, the probability per track of gaps and overlaps if the bond gap is excluded.

In conclusion, the \(\Phi\)-overlap of the NB detector designs has been overestimated, and should be reduced in any future detector design optimization. Gaps in \(\Phi\) or radius are negligible compared with bond gaps. Further disk optimization is possible.

## 3 Optimization of the Layout using the NB Disk and Detector Geometry.

In this section we retain the disk and detector geometry of the NB layout, and we find a longitudinal geometry for individual wheels, that:

* provides good pattern recognition capability without the requirement of an inner module ring at disk #2,
* deteriorates minimally the detector hermeticity (in any case to a level that is much less than the loss due to bond gaps), and
* improves, with respect to the NB layout, the minimal radial separation between space points.

The layout has been constrained as follows:

* the z-positions of disks 1 and 9 are constrained to the NB positions, respectively because of the minimal barrel-forward separation (taking into account the increased disk thickness), and the revised TRT envelope,
* the inner ring of modules on wheel #2, introduced for the NB layout, has been removed,
* a constrained coverage of \(|\eta|<2.47\) (with respect to the unfavourable 2-\(\sigma\) vertex limit) is required,
* a disk thickness of 34 mm, and detector designs as in the NB layout are assumed, and
* a loss of hermeticity is attempted, which is reasonable distributed in \(|\eta|\), and which does not exceed 10% for 4-point SCT tracks except at the barrel-forward interface (the 10% figure is qualitative, and chosen to correspond to the barrel hermeticity).

The geometry has been modelled including the exact trapezoid detector and stereo module designs and locations, including bond gaps. Straight tracks are generated randomly in azimuth and \(|\eta|\), with a gaussian vertex spread of \(\sigma=56\) mm. Typically \(10^{7}\) tracks are generated in each configuration.

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:10]

Figure 3-1 Layout NEW-A with qualitatively optimised wheel positions, and removal of the inner ring of modules in wheel #2.

The loss of hermeticity near the barrel-forward interface is in each case un-avoidable. As shown in Section 2, the NB layout has a large fractional overlap rate (with consequent material effects) in radius as well at azimuth. However, an adequate overlap is required for alignment purposes in the limiting cases at the outer radius of wheel #1 and the inner radius of wheel #6.

Figure 3-2 b) shows the minimum radial separation for 4-point tracks in each layout. Because of the decreased wheel #1 - wheel #2 separation, the radial separation between space points is small in the intermediate \(\mid\eta\mid\) region for the NB layout. Although not ideal for either layout, the distribution of the NEW-A layout is more uniform.

Figure 3-2: Fraction of tracks (a) as a function of \(\mid\eta\mid\), for which respectively < 4 or <3 space points are reconstructed by the SCT. Both the NEW-A and NB layouts are shown. The figure (b) compares the minimum radial separation between reconstructed space points, for each layout.

## 4 A Realistic Layout (NEW-B) based on the TDR Detector Design.

Three implicit constraints of the NB and NEW-A layouts can now be revisited.

* The wheel thickness (outer module to outer module) was assumed for the purposes of detector optimization to be 34 mm, and with rather different optimization criteria. This can now, in the most pessimistic circumstances, be assumed to be 31 mm [3] (the result will be little changed for 32 mm).
* A requirement of the pixel envelope resulted in an increase of the minimum active radius for the forward SCT detectors. With the decision to relocate the pixel detectors, this is no longer a constraint [4], for the radial changes described in this Section.
* The azimuthal overlap of the NB layout was clearly over-estimated, at least for the middle and inner rings.

As a result, we have radially relocated (see below) detectors of the TDR design on the forward wheels, with the aim of providing a wheel design that meets the existing ID specifications of hermeticity. Then, using (largely) an optimization of the wheel positions that reduces the level of \(<\)3 point tracks to \(\sim\) 1 per mil, and geometrical constraints, we demonstrate a satisfactory forward wheel geometry (called the NEW-B geometry).

### Wheel Design

The active radial dimensions of detectors fabricated according to the TDR design are shown in Table 7. In keeping with the program construction, and a decision of the SCT Steering Group related to the detector design, we assume a fixed angular strip pitch of respectively 0.2081 mrad for the inner/middle rings. We keep 0.1615 mrad for the outer rings as for the TDR, NB and NEW-A layouts. This means that detectors of the TDR design can be used and for the middle and inner rings are a conservative choice).

The radial position of each detector has been adjusted using

* an outer active radius of 56.0 cm radius (along the detector median plane),
* a bonding gap of 2.1 mm (c.f. 2.2 mm for the TDR)
* a radial relocation to prevent gaps between modules based on a 31 mm wheel thickness (as compared with 26 mm for the TDR).

The radial detector positions on each wheel are shown in Table 7, for each of the TDR and NEW-B designs. Also shown are the active detector pitches assumed. The radial positions of the inner and middle detectors have been motivated by the requirement of limited acceptance loss. The overlaps for each side of the outer (middle) wheels are 1.601 mrad (1.37 mrad), as compared with a requirement of 0.6198 mrad (0.806 mrad) for a 0.5% overlap on each detector side. Figures 4-1 a) and b) shows the distribution of the overlapping space points in wheels # 1 and #6, at z-positions of respectively 0.8385 m and 1.695 m. Table 8 shows the probability per track of that no space point is reconstructed in the wheel (gap), and the probability of an overlap in each of \(\Phi\) and radius. Using the current design, \(\Phi\) overlaps remain comfortable for both hermeticity and alignment, and the performance could profit from a longer middle and inner detectors at the expense of overlap. In both the NB and NEW-B wheel geometries, the R\({}_{\text{out}}\) overlap (wheel

#1) and R\({}_{\rm in}\) overlap (wheel #6) are marginal but still acceptable (see the previous comment in this context).

We conclude that a wheel geometry using the existing TDR detector design is satisfactory, and as good as that of the NB layout.

## 5 The NEW-C and NEW-D Wheel Designs.

Following a presentation of the NEW-B layout, it was requested that a new disk optimization be performed for a disk thickness of 32 mm, and with an optimization of all detector shapes. Because of the marginal differences with respect to the NEW-B layout, we present 2 possible disk layouts:

1. Design NEW-C assumes an optimised detector disk for the outer, middle and inner modules of the disk.
2. Design NEW-D assumes the TDR detector shape for outer modules, and optimised detector shapes for the middle and inner rings.

## 6 Conclusions

We make the following conclusions.

1. Detector bond gaps result in a loss of hermeticity which is significant, and a forward layout optimization based only on hermeticity arguments (ignoring the bond gaps) is inappropriate.

Figure 5-2: Fraction of tracks (a) as a function of \(|\mathrm{n}|\), for which respectively < 4 or <3 space points are reconstructed by the SCT. Both the NEW-C and NB layouts are shown. The figure (b) compares the minimum radial separation between reconstructed space points, for each layout.

2. A minimal change to the New Baseline layout (the NEW-A layout) retains reasonable hermeticity, improves the pattern recognition capability and avoids an inner module ring on wheel #2 (with consequent cost and material benefits).
3. Using the original TDR detector designs, with a slightly modified wheel layout, the performance specifications of the SCT Forward Tracker can be maintained using the NEW-B layout described in the text
4. The performance of the NEW-B layout could be further improved by a new optimization of the middle and inner detector dimensions. This has been done in the NEW-C and NEW-D layouts, with small improvements.
