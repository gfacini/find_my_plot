The possibility for ATLAS to use the barrel LAr EM accordion calorimeter with an integrated preshower but without a presampler is revisited in this note. This re-evaluation is based on the significant reduction of the cryostat thickness which is now considered feasible in the Technical Proposal TP[1] and in an ATLAS Internal Note[2]. In comparison with the amount of passive material in front of the active calorimeter used in previous calculations [3], the total reduction of material is 0.5 X\({}_{0}\) at \(\eta\)=0 and 1.0 X\({}_{0}\) at \(\eta\) =1.3 (see Fig. 1) including the decrease in material of the tracker and a better description of the mixture of electronics and cable in front of the calorimeter. The potential advantage of the TP model with a presampler[2] depends critically upon the amount of passive material. With the assumptions as in the TP one could start the calorimeter after approximately 1.5 X\({}_{0}\) of passive material at \(\eta\)=0 which we will show then reduces the need for a presampler.

The availability of new experimental data on the performance of an accordion calorimeter with a massless gap used to correct for the energy loss in the passive material[4] was another encouragement to perform this study. The experimental data from the 1994 beam test of a LKr accordion calorimeter show, in agreement with previous GEANT Monte Carlo MC simulations [5], that at least in the measured energy range 20-200 GeV, there is no dependence of the massless gap correction on the energy of the incident particle. With the depth of the massless gap properly optimized, all three longitudinal sections have the same "weight" equal to one for the best linearity and energy resolution. Fig. 2 shows the energy resolution as obtained in the test, using unity weights for each longitudinal section and correcting for the back leakage by the energy measured in the hadronic module.

Another result of this test shows (see Fig. 5) that the energy resolution (5.7 %/\(\sqrt{E}\)) is only very slightly compromised when an additional 1 X\({}_{0}\) of passive material is added to the 1.2 X\({}_{0}\) in front of the calorimeter for which massless gap has been optimized. The optimization of the massless gap is clearly a function of both the amount of dead material in front of the calorimeter and the intrinsic resolution of the device.

This note aims to compare the performance of an optimized model without a presampler to the TP base line model with a presampler through the answers to the following questions :

* What energy resolution resolution can be obtained for photons and electrons?
* What is the sensitivity of the performance to the amount of passive material?
* What is the optimal position and angular resolution?
* What level of \(\pi^{0}\) rejection can be achieved by \(\eta\) and UV-strips?The geometry, material distribution and accordion structure

Table 1. lists the radial dimensions of the segments of the cryostat and the EM calorimeter as well as the dimensions and angular range of the accordion structure.

Up to and including the 1 cm liquid gap left for clearance after the cold honeycomb cryostat wall, the same dimensions and material as in TP base line model are used. Then, instead of a 1 cm "air" gap, 1 cm of G10 is used as an excluder in this model. After that, the space occupied in the TP model by the presampler and the accordion calorimeter, is here all used by the accordion calorimeter. However, an additional 1 cm of radial space has been made available for the electronics and cables in front of the calorimeter.

The extra radial space once occupied by the presampler now is used to reduce the thickness of the lead absorber to 1.7 mm. As shown in Fig. 4, there is 26.2 X\({}_{0}\) of total material up to the end of the active accordion (198 cm) at \(\eta\)=0. At \(\eta\)=0 the depth of the strip sampling is \(\sim\) 4.5 X\({}_{0}\) and it contains a 4.1 cm deep massless gap where the lead is replaced by G10 in the absorber plates. The second sampling is 11.25 X\({}_{0}\) deep. Both samplings are tapered with \(\eta\), keeping the depth (in cm) along the shower direction constant. After \(\eta\)=0.8 the density of the calorimeter is decreased using 1.2 mm lead absorber. Here the depth of the strip sampling along the shower direction is \(\sim\) 4.3 X\({}_{0}\) but now it contains a 4.5 cm radially deep massless gap. Similarly the depth of the second sampling is changed to 8.8 X\({}_{0}\) and both samplings are tapered as previously. At \(\eta\)=1.3 the depth of the strip sampling along the shower direction is \(\sim\) 3.8 X\({}_{0}\) since the material in front of the calorimeter is \(\sim\) 3.1 X\({}_{0}\). The optimal depth of the massless gap was found by requiring that there be no correlation between the total energy deposited in the calorimeter and the energy deposited in the strip sampling for photons, excluding those which converted in the tracker at radii smaller than 80 cm.

For comparison, the amount of material in front of the presampler for the TP model and in front of the active accordion for the model without a presampler is shown in Fig. 1. Fig. 3 shows the distribution of the material in the tracker model used in this simulation. It is in the agreement with the distributions presented in [6].

Throughout this note, the same lateral dimensions of the strips and cells as in the TP model are used, as well as is the absorber composition except for the thickness of the lead as noted above.

Energy resolution of Photons and Electrons

A cluster size of 3\(\times\)7 cells (\(\eta\times\phi\)) has been used in this study for compatibility with the previous [2].

To recover the energy, no weights have been applied to the longitudinal divisions of the calorimeter, that is the "measured" energies were obtained from the sum of the energies deposited in the active medium, multiplied by the effective sampling factor: es(\(\eta\)):

\[\mbox{E}=\mbox{es}(\eta)\mbox{ * }(\mbox{E}(\mbox{strips})+\mbox{E}(\mbox{2nd sampling})+\mbox{ E}(\mbox{3rd sampling}).\]

For converted photons, slightly different values of effective sampling have been used (see Fig. 6)

Fig. 7 shows the sampling term of the energy resolution for 40 GeV E\({}_{T}\) photons in comparison with the TP model. Slightly better resolution is visible at small rapidities. In the model without a presampler, the effective sampling ratio of the massless gap behind the passive material in front of the calorimeter is the same as that of the active calorimeter.

Fig. 8 (9) shows the sampling term for 40(10) GeV E\({}_{T}\) electrons as a function of \(\eta\). For a cross-check, a model with a presampler with a geometry the same as the TP base line model has also been simulated and the values of the sampling term for this model are shown by the stars in the last plots. The results are in the agreement with those in the TP [2] within the errors.

Fig. 10 shows a comparison of the number of events in the tails for electrons of 10 GeV E\({}_{T}\). Both models when simulated with an identical tracker model show a similar increase in the tails. The large difference between the results obtained in the TP model and this simulation can be due a different radial distribution of material in the tracker.

## 4 Influence of additional passive material

To understand the response of the calorimeter to local modulations of the amount of material in front the calorimeter or in the case that the current average amount of the material would increase, several calculations were done adding material in front of the calorimeter. First at \(\eta\)=0, 0.1 X\({}_{0}\) was added at the outer radius of the tracker. Next, in addition to that, 0.1 X\({}_{0}\) was added to the skin of the honeycomb cold cryostat wall. Finally, 0.1 X\({}_{0}\) was distributed over the radial space of the tracker from 63 to 107 cm. While the previous two additions were assumed to increase in thickness like \(sin\theta\), the addition to the tracker material was assumed to be independent of \(\theta\). At \(\eta\)=1.1 the resulting excess is \(\sim\) 0.4 X\({}_{0}\) and at \(\eta\)=1.3 it is 0.5 X\({}_{0}\).

For unconverted photons (excluding those which convert at radii smaller than 80 cm) the "measured" energy spectrum up to \(\eta\)=1.1 is not influenced by this additional material, while at \(\eta\)=1.3 by the addition of the last 0.1 X\({}_{0}\) in the tracker, the low energy tail is becoming quite large (Fig. 11).

According to the distributions for all photons (Figs. 12, 13, 14), the effects are quite small at \(\eta\)=0.3, and additional material over the 0.3 X\({}_{0}\) may be tolerable at \(\eta\)=1.1. However, at \(\eta\)=1.3, an excess of 0.4 X\({}_{0}\) would double the number of events in the tail (to \(\sim\) 14%).

## 5 Position and angular resolutions

The "s-shape" corrections, typical for pad detectors, have been applied to obtain the position measurement by cells and strips for 40 GeV E\({}_{T}\) photons. Three strips (\(\pm\) 1 around most energetic) have been used in the first sampling. The cells of the second and third samplings (3\(\times\)3 - around most energetic) have been used together. The following noise levels for the electronics have been assumed:

* first sampling
* second sampling
* third sampling

The position resolution is shown in Fig. 15 as a function of \(\eta\). The \(\eta\) dependence seen here can be understood as the result of two effects. The energy increase with \(\eta\) for constant E\({}_{T}\) tends to improve the position resolution, while the increase in the passive material in front of the calorimeter with \(\eta\) acts just oppositely resulting in a small overall \(\eta\) dependence.

Fig. 15 shows also the dependence of the lever arm (distance between the shower barycentre in the strips and that in the second and third sampling) as obtained from GEANT. As expected, within the same density calorimeter, the lever arm increases slightly with \(\eta\)(energy). Since the density changes at \(\eta\)=0.8, the lever arm changes corespondingly. The numbers shown in this plot have been used for the calculation of the pointing (angular) resolution (Fig. 16) and for the resolution of z-coordinate of the "vertex". Fig. 17 shows the pointing and \(z\) vertex resolution as a function of the deviation in the lever arm from that predicted by GEANT. As seen, there can be a small improvement in the \(z\) vertex resolution at large \(\eta\).

Note that inspite of the better pointing resolution at larger \(\eta\) (\(\sim\) 45 mrad/\(\sqrt{E}\) - reflection of a longer lever arm), the resolution of the \(z\) of the vertex is significantly worse compared to low \(\eta\) because of the distance of the shower barycentre from the vertex (\(>\) 310 cm at \(\eta\)=1.3).

As mentioned above, the second and third samplings have been used together in this analysis. While the position measurement is slightly worse compared to use of the second sampling only, the increase in the lever arm results in a better angular resolution. The impact on the angular resolution from the higher levels of the electronics noise in the third sampling has also been evaluated. For noise levelsup to 200 MeV/cell, the resolution will detoriate a little (to \(\sim\) 49\(\pm\)2 mrad\(/\sqrt{E}\)). At 300 MeV/cell it was found to be \(\sim\) 62\(\pm\)2 mrad\(/\sqrt{E}\).

The exact division between the second and third layers is not critical for this analysis.

## 6 \(\pi^{0}\) rejection

Fig. 18 shows the distribution of variables used for \(\gamma/\pi^{0}\) separation. The variable "W" is the ratio of the energy deposited in the four strips (two on either side of the central three strips) to that deposited in the three central strips. The variable "V" is used in the case that there are two or more peaks detected within the shower. It is defined in a histogram of the energy in the strip versus strip number as the area of the valley between the largest and the next largest of other peaks formed by drawing a line parallel to the histogram axis at the height of the second largest peak. Only one dimensional cuts are used on these variables.

Figs. 19(20) shows the \(\pi^{0}\) rejection factor by the \(\eta\)-strips for E\({}_{T}\) = 50 GeV and 90% (85%) acceptance of photons without and with the use of the tracker information. The tracker information has been used with the same conditions as described in Ref. [7], that is, if a conversion was observed at radii smaller than 80 cm, then a cut on the p\({}_{T}\)/E\({}_{T}\) ratio has been applied to distinguish photons from \(\pi^{0}\)'s (Fig. 21). The same accuracy of p\({}_{T}\) measurement by the tracker has been assumed as in [7]. Within the errors, the same rejection factors for the model without a presampler have been obtained as for the TP base line model with presampler.

In Fig. 22 the performance of the \(\eta\) and UV strips is compared for 90% photon acceptance without the use of the tracker information. Except for the point at \(\eta\)=0.3, the \(\eta\) strips perform better than the UV strips and there is little difference with or without the presampler. Similarly for 85% photon acceptance, the \(\pi^{0}\) rejection is better for the \(\eta\) strips compared to UV strips without a presampler(Fig. 23; for the TP base line model the results are not available).

In Fig. 24 the same comparison is done for 85% acceptance of photons but now using the tracker information. In this simulation, the UV strips without a presampler seem to perform worse than with a presampler - perhaps due to the use of a less sophisticated approach than used in Ref. [7]). However, the \(\eta\) strips with or without a presampler perform at least as well as the UV strips.

The results shown above do not include electronic noise. When electronic noise is included (30 MeV per \(\eta\)-strip) the rejection is degraded by \(<\)10%. This rejection is at the same level as in the TP model.

## 7 Summary (The Model without Presampler)

Based on the results presented in the previous sections the following summary can be made :

* **Photons:** The energy resolution in this model is slightly better than that of the TP(see for example Fig. 7).
* **Electrons:** The energy resolution is the same as that of the TP model(see for example Figs. 8-9).
* **Sensitivity to extra passive material:** At least 0.3 X\({}_{0}\) of additional material in front of the active calorimeter can be tolerated for \(\eta<1.1\)(see Fig. 12, 13). At \(\eta=1.3\) an additional 0.2 X\({}_{0}\) can be tolerated(see Fig. 14). Tolerated implies a small impact on the energy resolution.
* **Angular Resolution:** For the \(\eta\) range 0-1.3, an angular resolution of 63-45 mrad/\(\sqrt{E}\) and a \(z\)(vertex) resolution of 11-28 cm/\(\sqrt{E}\) have been obtained(see Fig. 16).
* \(\pi^{0}\)**Rejection:** Using \(\eta\) strips, the same \(\pi^{0}\) rejection was obtained by both models(see Fig. 19). \(\eta\) strips do have a similar performance to UV-strips if the tracker information is used, but clearly outperform UV-strips without the use of the tracker information in both models(see Fig. 22, 24). The rejection is at the same level as the TP model.
