## 1 Mechanical properties of the straw tubes

Several results on this topic have already been published in [1]. In the following, a short summary of those results and some new ones are presented.

The straw proportional tubes for the TRT detector in ATLAS are prepared from a Kapton film, which contains a conductive layer on one side (1000 to 3000 Angs. Al + 4 \(\mu\)m Carbon-loaded Kapton), and a thermoplastic polyurethane layer of \(\sim~{}3~{}\mu\)m on the other one. The manufacturing process is performed on a precisely tooled mandrel, on which two Kapton-film tapes (4-8 mm wide) are wound in spirals at a temperature of \(\sim 200^{\circ}\)C, as shown in Fig. 1. This process ma provide straws of up to 5 m length. A cut through the straw wall is shown in Fig. 2. The total resulting straw wall thickness is about 60 \(\mu\)m. The straw wall thus has conductive layers on both sides. The properties of such straws have been investigated and some basic characteristics are given in Table 1.

Studies have shown that to keep the straw straight, it has to be stretched by a force not less than 200 g [1]. The problem which may then arise is that the straw material may flow with time; this would reduce the original straw tension and could be a major source of concern for the long term stability of a large system.

Figure 3 shows the elongation of straws of 50 cm length versus time under a load of 200 g. A continuous but erratic elongation of the straws is observed versus time, but the comparison of these data with the measurements of humidity during the same period (Fig. 4) shows a strong correlation between elongation and humidity. This measurement shows strikingly the sensitivity of the straw mechanical properties to humidity.

At constant humidity no changes in the straw length within an accuracy of 10 \(\mu\)m have been found, over a period of more than three months [1]. In Fig. 5 is shown the uniformity of the gas gain along the straw, which contains information about the straw straightness, for two different straws versus humidity. The straws had been pre-stretched by a 200 g load and their ends had then been fixed. It follows from these measurements that a humidity of more than 70% is damaging for the mechanical stability of such Kapton straws.

The gas gain uniformity along the straw as a function of temperature is shown in Fig. 6 for three different straws. There is no essential deterioration of the uniformity up to 65\({}^{\circ}\)C. To check the operational stability of straws with fixed ends, a special prototype was made, containing 30 straws of 33 cm length. No changes in the gas gain uniformity of any of the straws were observed over more than one year.

A more direct way of solving the problem of long term straw instability (due to humidity, temperature, load etc.) has been developed at CERN for the full-scale TRT wheel engineering prototype. A first approach attempted to use spring-like compensators attached to the straw endplugs. A more radical solution was finally chosen: it consists in reinforcing the straw walls with carbon fibres, which are glued along the straw. Each fibre contains about 500 to 1000 filaments of 7 \(\mu\)m diameter, which does not result in a too large increase of the straw wall mass, 10 to 30% depending on the number of filaments per fibre and on the number of fibres (3 or 4) glued to the straw. Some of the mechanical properties of such reinforced straws are given in Table 2. At the cost of a modest increase of the straw weight (and therefore radiation length), their mechanical rigidity and stability can be improved at least by one order of magnitude. An automatic machine for mass production of reinforced straws is under construction now at CERN.

The gas gain uniformity along the straw which is desired by construction is around 5%. Figure 7 shows what this means from the point of view of straw straightness or wire eccentricity (the data are shown for a gas mixture of 70% Xe + 20% CF\({}_{4}\) + 10% CO\({}_{2}\)). A 250 \(\mu\)m offset of the wire inside the straw results in a gas gain change of 4%. In practice the wire inside the straw is quite straight and the observed gas gain non-uniformities usually correspond to some curvature of the straw.

Possible deflections of the wire due to electrostatic forces (F) can be estimated from the following equation [2]:

\[F=\frac{2\pi\varepsilon_{0}V^{2}\delta}{b^{2}(ln(\frac{1}{a}))^{2}}, \tag{1}\]

where V is the anode wire potential, a is the anode wire radius, b is the cathode radius, and \(\delta\) is the wire offset.

The deflection d due to electrostatic forces is:

\[d=\frac{L^{2}F}{8T}, \tag{2}\]

where L is the straw length and T is the tension of the wire.

\[d=\frac{2\pi\varepsilon_{0}V^{2}L^{2}(\frac{1+d}{2})}{8Tb^{2}(ln\frac{1}{a})^ {2}}. \tag{3}\]

For L = 1 m, T = 50 g and V = 1800 V we obtain d = 0.4\(\delta\). Such deflections could be large for 1 m long wires with large offsets, typically 100 \(\mu\)m for an offset of 250 \(\mu\)m. The maximal deflection of the wire due to gravitation is about 45 \(\mu\)m for a 50 \(\mu\)m diameter and 1 m long Cu-Be wire.

## 2 Electrical properties of the straw tubes

The most important electrical characteristics of the straws are given in Table 3. More detailed information about the straw electrical properties may be found in [3, 4, 5]; a summary of present knowledge is presented here.

As already mentioned, there are two conductive layers in the straw, placed on the inside and outside surface of the straw wall. Such a design does not result in any significant increase of the straw material thickness, but gives additional robustness in case of cathode conductive layer damage (for example due to accidental breakdowns). It has been shown experimentally that after several breakdowns at one point in the straw, the resistance of the inner cathode layer sharply increases (up to 30 k\(\Omega\)), which is fatal for a straw with one single conductive layer. On the other hand, the fast signal propagation characteristics of a straw with a double conductive layer remain unchanged in the same situation.

The fast signal propagation properties depend on the cathode and anode resistance. The anode wire resistance is about 60 \(\Omega\) per metre for a DC current. For a real signal with a shaping time of 10 ns (25 ns at the base for a

\end{table}
Table 2: **Mechanical properties of reinforced straw tubes**central frequency of about 25 MHz), the anode resistance remains the same due to the quite large skin depth of the Cu-be wire (about 25 \(\mu\)m at 25 MHz).

The cathode resistance of the Kapton straw is about 400-800 \(\Omega\) per metre long straw, and depends on the width of the tape from which the straws are produced. In the case of straws reinforced by carbon fibres, the propagation properties are improved due to the low resistance of the carbon fibres. The attenuation properties of these different types of straws were measured directly. It was found that, for a signal with a shaping time of 10 ns, the attenuation length is 2-3 m (depending on the width of the tape) for straws without C-fibres, and 4 m for straws with C-fibres.

For coaxial structures such as these straw tubes, the characteristic impedance may be calculated using:

\[Z_{0}\ =\ 60\ ln(b/a), \tag{4}\]

for an ideal loss-free line. If the anode and cathode have significant series resistance, the characteristic impedance will be frequency dependent:

\[Z_{0}\ =\ \sqrt{(R+j\omega L)/(G+j\omega C)}, \tag{5}\]

where R is the resistance, L the inductance, G the conductance and C the capacitance, all per unit length. G is usually negligible and therefore:

\[Z_{0}\ =\ \sqrt{(R+j\omega L)/j\omega C)}. \tag{6}\]

If R is small, the impedance will be 260 \(\Omega\). It was shown experimentally, that for the straw tube parameters given in Table 3, the optimal termination resistance is about 300 \(\Omega\). As can be seen from Fig. 8, for a well-shaped signal, there are no traces of reflections for a 1 m long non-terminated straw.

It is important to emphasise that for such a shaping the non-uniformity of the signal amplitude along a 1 m long straw is not more than 5% r.m.s., and that the pulse-height from \({}^{55}\)Fe photons is only 10% less than for shorter straws (50 cm or less). The signal width for a source positioned at the far end of the straw is 26 ns at the base, and 28 ns for a source positioned at the near end.

We intend to use unterminated straw tubes. Their electrical connection to the front-end electronics is shown schematically in Fig. 9 The coupling capacitor (C\({}_{e}\)) is shared between several (typically 4 to 16) straws, which are connected to the HV through a HV resistor-fuse (R\({}_{HV}\)), with a nominal value of 100 k\(\Omega\). This electrical chain is characterised by only one time constant, \(\tau\) = R\({}_{HV}\)\(\cdot\) C\({}_{e}\) = 200 \(\mu\)s. The discharge current of this chain goes through the input resistor of the preamplifier and has the same polarity as the fast signal from the straw.

For the barrel part of the TRT in ATLAS, straws of 2 metre length are considered. To reduce the straw occupancy, the anode wire will be divided

\end{table}
Table 3: **Electrical properties of the straw tubes**into two separate parts at the middle of the straw. Several 2 metre long straws were fabricated and were tested for cross-talk and amplitude uniformity along the straw. The experimental layout and results are shown in Fig. 10. It was found that in the case of a common cathode for both wires the cross-talk is about 10%. For cathodes disconnected at the midpoint of the straw, the cross-talk was reduced to less than 2%. For such an arrangement, the uniformity of the signal amplitude along the straw is the same as for a 1 m long straw, i.e. at the level of 5%.

In large systems containing thousands of elements, some protection against catastrophic breakdowns (for example in case of broken wires) has to be foreseen. On the other hand, it should preserve the electrical contact through the high-voltage chain in case of accidental breakdowns, which means that disconnection should occur only in case of a large continuous current through the straw. We have therefore designed special fuses, switched on as shown in Fig. 9. The basic idea is to use the heating-up of a resistor (for example of 100 k\(\Omega\)) in case of a short-circuit inside a straw. A special spring was connected to the resistor by a solder with a well-defined melting point (190degC for the prototypes which were tested).

The time needed to disconnect the HV chain for different currents is shown in Fig. 11 (for resistor values of 0.9 to 2.9 M\(\Omega\)). As can be seen, for R = 940 k\(\Omega\), the faulty channel may be disconnected in one minute for a current of 1 mA. Of course this is just an example of the principle of operation of the fuse. It is clear that it's final parameters (size, current, solder melting point) have to be optimised further for operation in LHC conditions. We also note that, in case of disconnection of a faulty channel, all straws connected to the same coupling capacitor will also be disconnected.

## 3 Operating properties of the straw tubes at LHC

### Total signal collection time in a 2 Tesla magnetic field

At the LHC the ATLAS TRT will be placed in a magnetic field. It is well known that the electron drift velocity in gases depends on the value of the magnetic field, which generally leads to an increase in the total signal collection time.

Dedicated measurements of the drift velocity and Lorentz angles in a magnetic field of 2 Tesla were performed for the reference gas mixture of 70% Xe + 20% CF\({}_{4}\) + 10% CO\({}_{2}\). Preliminary experimental results [6] are shown in Figs. 12, 13 and 14. The experimental data are compared with the results of simulations using the MAGBOLTZ program [7] for H = 0 and H = 2 T.

The comparison of Fig. 12 (H = 2 T) and Fig. 14 (H = 0) shows that the peak drift velocity is slightly higher in the magnetic field. There is only a 7% difference between the calculations and the experimental results at this peak value for H = 2 T. Figure 13 shows the variation of the Lorentz angle for electrons as a function of the electric field. Finally the predicted drift velocity component, parallel to the electric field, which defines the total signal collection time, is shown in Fig. 15 for H = 0 and 2 T. This parallel component of the drift velocity is smaller in the magnetic field than that without magnetic field in the 1 mm region near the cathode (electric field less than 4 kV/cm). On the other hand, this component does not depend on the value of the magnetic field over the 1 mm region near the anode wire.

The MAGBOLTZ program has been checked experimentally through these measurements and thus gives us a flexible tool for optimisation of the straw parameters in terms of the total signal collection time. In particular, to make the gas mixture faster, the CF\({}_{4}\) content should be increased as much as possible. However, for gas gain stabilisation the CO\({}_{2}\) content should be at least 6%. A decrease in the Xe concentration leads to a deterioration of the electron-pion separation abilities of the TRT.

Several calculations of the total signal collection time are shown in Table 4. For the reference gas mixture mentioned above and a cathode diameter of 4 mm, the total signal collection time is 38 ns, which can be reduced to less than 30 ns for a Xe concentration as low as 50%. For a smaller cathode diameter of 3.5 mm, a total signal collection time of 25 ns (one bunch crossing) can be achieved. In this case, the gas pressure may be increased up to 1.4 atm. to preserve the Xe content in the straws.

### Straw counting rate due to charged particles and neutrons

Under LHC operating conditions, i.e. at the revised nominal design luminosity of 10\({}^{34}\) cm\({}^{-2}\)s\({}^{-1}\), the ATLAS straw tubes will be continuously irradiated by charged particles and neutrons. The charged particles are mostly minimum ionising particles. The straw occupancy, defined as the probability that the straw is hit in a given bunch crossing, depends on the radial position and length of the straw. For the barrel part of the TRT the occupancy of the 1 m long straws is maximal for the innermost layer (R = 56 cm) and has been estimated to be 34%, assuming that one bunch crossing corresponds to an average of 18 minimum bias events [8]. The corresponding occupancy at the old design luminosity of 1.7 \(\cdot\) 10\({}^{34}\) cm\({}^{-2}\)s\({}^{-1}\) was about 45%. For the endcap TRT, the occupancy is essentially independent of straw position, since the straws are radial, and is about 15%.

This means that the maximum counting rate of the straws would be 

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|} \hline Gas mixture & Straw diameter (mm) & Gas pressure (mm.) & Xe content (mm.) & Total collection (mm.) & Total collection (mm.) \\ \hline
70\% Xe + 20\% CF\({}_{4}\) + 10\%CO\({}_{2}\) & 4.0 & 1.0 & 1.0 & 38 \\  & 3.5 & 1.0 & 0.85 & 32 \\ \hline

55\% Xe + 39\% CF\({}_{4}\) + 6\% CO\({}_{2}\) & 4.0 & 1.0 & 0.78 & 32 \\  & 3.5 & 1.2 & 0.81 & 26 \\  & 3.5 & 1.4 & 0.95 & 26 \\ \hline
50\% Xe + 44\% CF\({}_{4}\) + 6\% CO\({}_{2}\) & 4.0 & 1.2 & 0.84 & 30 \\  & 3.5 & 1.4 & 0.88 & 25 \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 4: **Total signal collection time in the straw tubes in a 2 T magnetic field**14 MHz in the barrel part and 6 MHz in the endcap part. The occupancy of the 40 cm long straws in the barrel part, which are placed at smaller radii (30 to 50 cm) to cover the barrel/endcap crack, is similar to that of the first layers of 1 m long straws, but the density of charged particles per unit straw length is about 2.5 times larger.

The distribution of the neutron flux is quite uniform in the inner volume of the ATLAS detector, as described in the LoI. The total fluence of neutrons of all energies (including the thermal region) is around \(10^{14}\) cm\({}^{-2}\) per year. This gives a flux through the straw surface (50 \(\cdot\) 0.4 cm\({}^{2}\)) of 2 \(\cdot\) 10\({}^{8}\) neutrons per second. Obviously this flux will produce a certain rate of background signals in the straw tubes. The energy spectrum of the neutrons depends upon the detailed configuration of the detector system, in particular on the presence or absence of a moderator. The primary flux consists of fast neutrons produced in the calorimeter, however the presence of the moderator shifts this neutron energy spectrum towards the thermal region. To evaluate the neutron induced contribution ot the straw counting rate, a dedicated measurement was performed, in operating conditions as close as possible to those expected in ATLAS.

The experimental setup is shown in Fig. 16. The neutron source used was a \({}^{239}\)Pu-Be source of fast neutrons but also of gamma radiation. The neutron and gamma energy spectra are shown in Figs. 17a and 17b respectively. The activity of the source was about 1.6 \(\cdot\) 10\({}^{5}\) s\({}^{-1}\) for neutrons and about 6 \(\cdot\) 10\({}^{5}\) s\({}^{-1}\) for gammas. According to these figures the source emits approximately 3.5 photons of MeV energy per neutron. Several straw tubes of 4 mm diameter and 12 cm length were inserted into a polyethylene foam radiator of 16 cm thickness. A lead shielding was inserted between the straws and the source to suppress the gamma radiation. It was found that 200 mm of lead was enough to absorb more than 95% of the direct gammas from the Pu-Be source, so we consider that the measured straw counting rates for such a thickness of lead shielding lead to an upper limit on the background rate induced by neutrons. When a 70 mm thick polystyrene moderator was inserted between the lead shielding and the straws, the straw counting rate increased significantly. This is due to the fact that the straws and the radiator are then irradiated by slow neutrons and the various (n, \(\gamma\)) reactions in the materials of the experimental set-up increase the straw counting rate. After a careful evaluation of the neutron flux, the probability for a neutron to induce a hit in a straw was estimated to be (0.9 \(\pm\) 0.2) \(\cdot\) 10\({}^{-3}\) for energy depositions less than 5 keV (corresponding to the expected energy loss of relativistic particles in the straws), and (0.4 \(\pm\) 0.1) \(\cdot\) 10\({}^{-3}\) for energy depositions of more than 5 keV (corresponding to the signals expected from transition radiation). These data are in good agreement with the data from [9] and have been used to estimate an upper limit on the neutron induced counting rate at LHC.

For a normalised neutron fluence of 10\({}^{14}\) cm\({}^{-2}\) per year of operation at LHC (pessimistic case), and a 50 cm straw length, Fig. 18 shows the estimatedhit rates and occupancies from charged particles (a) and neutrons (b), for both of the above-mentioned energy deposition ranges. We conclude that the occupancy induced by the neutron background is an order of magnitude less than that due to charged particles.

### Ageing properties of the straw tubes

The radiation hardness of the Kapton straw tubes and possible ageing effects have been widely investigated over the past few years [1, 10, 11, 12]. We limit ourselves here to the following remarks:

1.) The radiation resistance of the Kapton straws is very high. No changes in the straws (gas gain, mechanical properties etc.) were observed for fluences of \(4\cdot 10^{14}\)cm\({}^{-2}\) from fast neutrons and of \(1.7\cdot 10^{15}\) cm\({}^{-2}\) from slow neutrons, and also for ionising particle doses of 80 Mrad. This is equivalent to more than 20 years of operation at the highest LHC luminosities.

2.) No ageing in the straw tubes for a total integrated charge of up to 5 C/cm was observed, which corresponds to over 8 years of operation at design luminosity.

3.) No etching effects on the straw cathode were observed for a similar integrated charge. This was not the case for a thin unprotected Al-layer.

Recently new tests were carried out in collaboration with RD10 at CERN to pursue these studies under optimally controlled conditions [12]. A special monitoring chamber with a large drift space (2 cm), a Gas Chromatograph and a Mass Selective Device were installed downstream from the straw tube under investigation. Again no traces of straw ageing were observed (Fig. 19). However some additional information was obtained: a large deterioration of the spectrum measured in the monitoring chamber placed after the straw tube was observed, as shown in Figs. 20 (before irradiation) and 21 (after irradiation). This means that the gas composition is somehow modified in the avalanche plasma of the irradiated region in the straw, presumably producing some neutral but electronegative radicals. These radicals flow into the monitoring chamber where they capture electrons drifting across the relatively long chamber gap, which leads to the spectrum deformation observed in Fig. 21. In Fig. 22, many products from CF\({}_{4}\) dissociation, identified in the Mass Selectove Device, can be observed.

From these results we conclude that a detailed study is needed to evaluate the possible consequences of this CF\({}_{4}\) dissociation on the design of the straw gas purification and circulation system, and hence on the long term stability of straw operation at LHC.

### Space charge effects and straw performance at high fluxes of ionising particles

Due to the long drift time of positive ions in the straw tubes, some space charge is accumulated in the gas volume. In the worst case (first straw layers in the barrel TRT), the intensity of charged particles per unit length is 14 MHz/40 cm = 3.5 \(\cdot\) 10\({}^{5}\) particles per cm per second. The ion space charge arising from such fluxes can change the electric field inside the straw. Dedicated measurements were performed to check the influence of this space charge on the gas gain and the drift time accuracy. The experimental set-up was the same as for the straw drift time accuracy tests (Fig. 23). Two straw tube arrays were placed one behind another in a beam of 2 GeV pions with a width of 15 mm. The straws were irradiated by an \({}^{55}\)Fe source (5.9 keV) up to intensities of 2.5 \(\cdot\) 10\({}^{5}\) photons per cm per second, over a length of 22 mm, which covered the beam particle spread across the straws. The total deposited charge is equivalent to a minimum ionising particle intensity of 7.5 \(\cdot\) 10\({}^{5}\) particles per cm per second (assuming that the average energy deposition of charged particles in the straws is \(\sim\) 2 keV).

The time difference between signals from two consecutive straws was measured and used to extract the individual straw drift time measurement accuracy (\(\sim\) 150 \(\mu\)m). Figure 24 shows the evolution of this accuracy and of the straw signal amplitude as a function of the intensity of straw irradiation. No deterioration of these fundamental straw properties was observed up to intensities of 6 \(\cdot\) 10\({}^{5}\) particles per cm per second.

### Ion tail cancellation at high counting rate

One of the most serious problems for the design of the front-end electronics of straw tubes operating at high counting rate is the cancellation of the long ion tails which contribute to the signal. Possible overlapping of ion tails from successive hits in the same straw may lead to a continuous but fluctuating current through the straw. This in turn may result in base-line shifts in the electronic circuits and a resulting effective spread of discriminator thresholds. Techniques for eliminating such base-line shifts have been developed [13]. But the inherent fluctuations may spoil the position accuracy of the straws, as obtained from drift-time measurements, but also give rise to fake hits and loss of efficiency. This means that as precise as possible a cancellation of these ion tails has to be built into the front-end electronics.

For cylindrical proportional chambers the signal current is usually expressed as [14, 15]:

\[I(t)=\frac{I_{0}}{1+t/t_{0}}, \tag{7}\]with

\[t_{0}=\frac{a^{2}ln(b/a)}{2\mu_{p}V}, \tag{8}\]

where \(\mu_{p}\) = 0.6 cm\({}^{2}\)s\({}^{-1}\)V\({}^{-1}\) is the Xenon ion mobility. One then obtains \(t_{0}\) = 11.4 ns [5], but this simple evaluation doesn't take into account all physical processes which occur near the anode wire.

Detailed measurements of the current and charge in the Kapton straws were performed for the reference gas mixture (70% Xe + 20% CF\({}_{4}\) + 10% CO\({}_{2}\)) by irradiating the straw with an \({}^{55}\)Fe source. The current amplifier used had a rise-time of 3.5 ns and did not display any drop in response to a rectangular input pulse for at least 300 ns. The charge-sensitive preamplifier had a rise-time of 20 ns and a feed-back time constant of 18 ms. To minimise any influence from additional circuits on the signal shape, the anode wire was directly connected to these amplifiers. The high voltage was applied to the straw cathode, and the HV power supply was disconnected at the exact time of the measurements, to minimise the impact of any external noise. The measurements were carried out with a 350 MHz digital scope. Typical photographs of the observed current and charge pulses are shown in Figs. 25 (top) and 26 respectively. For comparison a photograph of the current pulse in a 80% Ar + 20% CH\({}_{4}\) mixture is shown in Fig. 25 (bottom). Figure 26 demonstrates that the total charge is collected over more than 50 \(\mu\)s. One can note the large difference in the current pulse shapes between the Xe and Ar mixtures. In the Xe mixture the electron component of the signal is quite apparent, whereas only the ion current can be distinguished in the Ar mixture. The total collection time in the Xe mixture is 60 \(\mu\)s (28 \(\mu\)s for the Ar mixture). The contribution of the electron current to the total collected charge was found to be 3%.

The data obtained using the current amplifier are shown in Fig. 27 as 1/I(t), the inverse of the current, versus the time t. This figure indicates that the effective ion mobility changes at a time around 120 to 140 ns. The data obtained using the charge preamplifier are shown in Fig. 28. An additional change in the effective ion mobility is observed at a time around 350 ns. These experimental data for different time intervals are well described by:

\[I(t)=\frac{Q_{0}-Q_{el}}{2t_{0i}ln(b/a)(\frac{r_{i}^{2}}{a^{2}}+\frac{t-t_{i}} {t_{0i}})} \tag{9}\]

for the current pulses and:

\[Q(t)=\frac{(Q_{0}-Q_{el})}{2ln(b/a)}ln(\frac{r_{i}}{a}+\frac{(t-t_{i})}{t_{0i }})+Q_{el} \tag{10}\]

for the charge pulses, where \(Q_{0}\) is the total charge, \(Q_{el}\) is the electron contribution to the total charge, \(t_{i}\) is the time of effective ion mobility change, \(t_{0i}\) is the time constant for the appropriate time interval and \(r_{i}\) is the radius which corresponds to \(t_{i}\).

The following values were chosen for \(t_{i}\): \(t_{1}=0\), \(t_{2}=120\) ns and \(t_{3}=350\) ns. The corresponding values for \(r_{i}\) were then obtained from the Q(t) dependence (Fig. 28): \(r_{1}=\) a = 25 \(\mu\)m, \(r_{2}=100\)\(\mu\)m and \(r_{3}=240\)\(\mu\)m. Finally the time constants were extracted: \(t_{01}=55\) ns, \(t_{02}=5\) ns and \(t_{03}=9.5\) ns.

From the point of view of the front-end electronics design we have to find the best possible parameterisation of the experimental current using exponentials:

\[F(t)=A_{1}e^{-t/r_{1}}+A_{2}e^{-t/r_{3}}+A_{3}e^{-t/r_{3}}, \tag{11}\]

where \(A_{i}\) and \(r_{i}\) are the constants for the pole/zero cancellation circuits in the preamplifier/shaper. From a practical point of view it would be preferable to have just a double exponential fit. The difference between the real current shape and this parameterisation results in a residual ion tail. To estimate the impact of such tails, an ad hoc fit (artificial fit) was performed to the experimantal data. This fit is shown as a dashed line in Figs. 28 and 29.

The results of a fit to the data by a function F(t) with two and three exponent parameterisations are shown in Fig. 30 for the current amplifier and in Fig. 31 for the charge preamplifier. The best fit was obtained for:

\[A_{1}\ =\ 0.925;A_{2}\ =\ 0.075;\tau_{1}=110ns;\tau_{2}=1000ns \tag{12}\]

in the case of a double exponential parameterisation, and

\[A_{1}\ =\ 0.899\ ;\ A_{2}\ =\ 0.092\ ;\ A_{3}\ =\ 0.009\ ; \tag{13}\] \[\tau_{1}\ =\ 105\ ns\ ;\ \tau_{2}\ =\ 628\ ns\ ;\ \tau_{3}\ =\ 10000\ ns \tag{14}\]

in the case of a triple exponential parameterisation.

Fig. 32 shows the difference between the artificial function and the exponential parameterisations. The plots are presented with a scale normalised to \(I_{max}\), the peak ion current (at t = 4.5 ns), obtained by extrapolation. These results are now under evaluation by the electronics experts to understand their implications for the front-end electronics.

### Temperature distribution in the straws at high counting rate

At design luminosity the maximum current through a straw is \(7~{}\mu\)A, for a 14 MHz rate, an average number of 100 ion pairs per charged particle and a gas gain of \(2.5\cdot 10^{4}\). This leads to a power dissipation of 13 mW in the straw. Since the temperature within a straw has to remain constant to within a few degrees, in order to preserve the uniformity of the gas gain, some method of cooling the straws has to be devised. Two possible approaches for this temperature stabilisation in the straw gas volume may be considered: the first is to cool using the gas flow inside the straws and the second to cool using a gas flow outside and around the straws. The relationship between the gas flow and the temperature gradient between the two ends of a straw is:

\[W=C_{p}\cdot\Delta T\cdot M_{gas}, \tag{15}\]

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|} \hline Maximum current pulse for & 10 \(\mu\)A for a shaping \\
6 keV at a gas gain of \(2.5\cdot 10^{4}\) & time of 20 ns at the base \\ \hline Maximum continuous ion current & 7 \(\mu\)A \\ at highest LHC luminosities & \\ \hline Max. power dissipation in gas & 13 mW \\ \hline Ageing & more than 5 C/cm (8 years at LHC) \\ Etching & more than 2.5 C/cm (no traces of etching seen) \\ \hline Straw radiation resistance & Fast neutrons: up to \(4\cdot 10^{14}\) \\  & Slow neutrons: up to \(1.7\cdot 10^{15}\) \\  & Dose from charged particles: 80 Mrad \\ \hline Minimum gas flow needed & 0.05 cm\({}^{3}\)/min per straw \\   through the straw &. \\ \hline Minimum gas flow needed for cooling & 260 cm\({}^{3}\)/min per straw \\ at maximum occupancy ( \(\Delta\)T=3\({}^{\circ}\) K) & \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 6: **Operating properties of the straw tubes (continued)**where W is the power dissipation in the straw, \(C_{p}\) = 21 J/mol/\({}^{\circ}\)K is the gas specific heat at constant pressure, \(\Delta\)T is the temperature gradient and M is the gas flow in mass per second. For a straw volume of 13 cm\({}^{3}\) (1 m long straws), the Xe mass inside the straw is 7.3 \(\cdot\) 10\({}^{-2}\) g. For a maximum temperature gradient of 3\({}^{\circ}\)K, corresponding to a gas gain non-uniformity between the two ends of the straw of about 10%, we need a gas flow M = 2.2 \(\cdot\) 10\({}^{-2}\) g/s. This corresponds to a gas flow in volume of 4.4 cm\({}^{3}\)/s, i.e. a complete change of gas in the straw every three seconds. For the barrel straws at larger radius and the endcap straws, the corresponding necessary gas flow would be 1.8 cm\({}^{3}\)/s. Such a high gas flow is not only impractical but would also result in an abnormal expenditure of the expensive Xe gas, even using a closed-circuit gas system. The straw cooling will therefore have to be achieved through a controlled gas flow outside and around the straw walls. The same neutral gas (CO\({}_{2}\) or He) could be used as that foreseen for an efficient ventilation of the radiator, which is meant to make sure that any Xe leaking outside the straws is continuously swept away.

There may even be a problem with the temperature gradient inside the straw gas volume itself. The heat flow through a surface A is:

\[W=-\lambda A\frac{dT}{dx}, \tag{16}\]

where \(\lambda\) = 5.5 \(\cdot\) 10\({}^{-5}\) W/cm/\({}^{\circ}\)K. The heat dissipation in an element of radius r in the straw volume is:

\[W(r)=I\ k\ ln(r/r_{a}) \tag{17}\]

per unit length, where I is the current per unit length and \(k\ ln(r/r_{a})\) is the difference in potential between the two points at radii r and \(r_{a}\) (anode wire radius). From the above we can derive the approximate relations:

\[I\ k\ ln(r/r_{a})\ =\ -\ \lambda\ 2\pi r\ \frac{dT}{dr}, \tag{18}\]

\[\Delta T\ =\ -\ \frac{Ik}{2\pi\lambda}\int_{r_{a}}^{r_{a}}\frac{ln(r/r_{a})}{ r}dx=\frac{Ik}{4\pi\lambda}ln^{2}(r_{c}/r_{a}). \tag{19}\]

For the 1 m long barrel straws, the maximum power dissipation is:

W = I k \(\ln(r_{c}/r_{a})\) = 130 \(\mu\)W/cm,

and the maximum temperature gradient is therefore \(\Delta\)T = 0.8\({}^{\circ}\)K. For the 40 cm long straws placed at the smallest radius (30 cm), the maximum power dissipation is 320 \(\mu\)W/cm and therefore \(\Delta\)T = 2\({}^{\circ}\)K. Since the distribution of temperature along the straw is uniform in this case, we conclude that the main effect of such local temperature gradients will be to increase slightly (by less than 10%) the gas gain of the straws drawing the most current.

To conclude this Section, Tables 5 and 6 summarise the main operating properties of the Kapton straw tubes at LHC.

## 4 Monte-Carlo (MC) simulation of the straw response

### MC-model of the straw response and comparison with data

A dedicated simulation program was developed in order to test in as flexible a way as possible the performance of the straws as tracker elements in a magnetic field and at high counting rate. The description of the physical processes occurring in the straws was made as realistic as possible. The straw simulation model includes:

* The straw attenuation length of \(\sim\) 2 m,
* The signal propagation time of \(\sim\) 4 ns/m,
* The signal reflection from the far end of the straw,
* The signal shaping A(t) (20 ns width at the base), using a real signal shape from an \({}^{55}\)Fe source,
* Ionisation in the straws, computed as a number of clusters on the particle track. The probability for a given distance x between collisions in the gas is \[W(x)=exp(-x/x_{0}),\] where \(x_{0}=L/N_{el}\) (L is the length of the track in the straw and \(N_{el}\) is the average number of clusters per unit length. The energy of these clusters, \(E_{el}\), is calculated on the basis of an approach [16], which we used in the program of TRT simulation,
* Gas gain fluctuations are also taken into account \[\sigma_{E_{el}}\sim 0.25\cdot\sqrt{E_{el}},\] with \(E_{el}\) in keV (the energy resolution was measured to be \(\sim\) 25% at FWHM for cluster energies of 6 keV from an \({}^{55}\)Fe source),
* Electronics noise, simulated as \[E_{n}sin(2\pi\omega t+2\pi P),\] where \(E_{n}\) is distributed following a Gaussian of \(\sim\) 70 \(\mu\)m resolution and P is a random number between 0 and 1,
* The dependence of the drift velocity on the electric field, taken from the MAGBOLTZ program (see section 3.1),The output amplitude is then defined as:

\[A_{out}(t)=\sum_{i}E_{el}^{i}A(t-t_{i}),\]

where \(t_{i}\) is the drift time measured for a given cluster. The contribution of diffusion to the drift time accuracy is at most 30 \(\mu\)m and has therefore been neglected. The range of delta electrons was not included in the simulations.

Fig. 33 shows the simulated straw signal shapes from an \({}^{55}\)Fe source (a) and 2 GeV pions crossing the straw at radii of 0 and 1 mm. The straw model was compared to the data from the experimental setup described in Section 3.4 (see also fig. 23). For 2 GeV pions crossing two consecutive straws on a given side of their anode wires, fig. 34 shows the measured distribution for the difference in signal arrival times between the two straws, for signals exceeding the discriminator threshold of 0.2 keV. The fit to the measured distribution yields an r.m.s. value of \(\sim\) 200 \(\mu\)m, in good agreement with the individual straw drift time accuracy of 150 \(\mu\)m.

Fig. 35 shows in more detail the expected drift time accuracy per straw as a function of the discriminator threshold. Line 1 corresponds to a straw response simulation without the expected gas gain fluctuations and without electronic noise. Line 2 includes the effect of gas gain fluctuations. Finally line 3 also includes the contribution from electronic noise, and is found to be in excellent agreement with the experimental data. Fig. 36 shows that the straw model also accurately reproduces the measured time-distance relationship for a discriminator threshold of 0.2 keV, for tracks crossing the straw on both sides of the anode wire (+R,-R).

### Spatial resolution of the straw tubes at high counting rate

As discussed in Section 3.5, residual ion tails, not properly cancelled by the shaping front-end electronics, may significantly deteriorate the straw performance, particularly in terms of drift-time accuracy, and may also increase substantially the straw occupancy at high counting rate. The magnitude of this problem was investigated, using the straw response model described above and introducing into the simulation the expected residual ion tails shwon in fig. 32 for double and triple pole/zero cancellation.

These expected residual ion tails were normalised to the energy deposited in the straw for each particle hit and integrated over 60 \(\mu\)s. The probability that a given straw be hit by several particles in the same bunch crossing was also taken into account. Fig. 37 shows the resulting expected energy spectrum in a straw with low occupancy (top) and a straw with 50% occupancy (bottom). The average energy seen increases from 1.9 keV to 2.5 keV as the occupancy increases from a few % to 50%.

One can then evaluate the base-line level and it's fluctuations as a function of the shaping electronics. The results of this simulation are shown in figs. 38 to 42. For a straw occupancy of 50%, figs. 38a and 39a show the expected base-line levels in keV versus time for double and triple pole-zero cancellation respectively. The full (respectively dashed) lines correspond to front-end electronics without (respectively with) base-line restoration. Clearly a base-line restoration circuit will be needed in the front-end electronics in order to operate the straw at high counting rate and discriminator thresholds as low as 0.2 keV. Figs 38b and 39b show the expected distributions of the high-frequency component of the base-line levels in the various cases.

The dependence of the r.m.s. values of the above distributions on the straw occupancy and the various front-end electronic configurations is shown in fig. 40. Even for occupancies as high as 50%, the expected r.m.s. value of the base-line level is below 0.1 keV after base-line restoration. The additional occupancy induced by these base-line level fluctuations has also been evaluated and is shown in fig. 41, for a discriminator threshold of 0.2 keV, as a function of the straw occupancy and for the various front-end electronic configurations. This figure shows again that base-line restoration is necessary at high counting rate: for a straw occupancy of 50% the induced additional occupancy would only be \(\sim 3\%\) for a double pole-zero cancellation.

Finally fig. 42 shows the impact of the residual base-line fluctuations on the accuracy of the drift-time measurement, for discriminator thresholds of 0.2 keV and 0.3 keV. The residual base-line fluctuations estimated above will degrade the individual straw measurement accuracy from 150 \(\mu\)m to 180 \(\mu\)m. We note in addition that the overall straw detector performance will also be degraded at high luminosity because many drift time measurements will be lost: typically 15% of the drift time hits would be lost for a straw occupancy of 30%.

### Minimisation of the straw occupancy in the ATLAS barrel TRT

Although extensive simulation work, based on the measured straw tube performance in test beam, has shown that the TRT provides efficient and robust second-level triggering and pattern recognition [17, 18], it is clear that every effort should be made to reduce the straw tube occupancies, especially in the barrel region at the innermost radius, where the maximum predicted occupancy is \(\sim 34\%\) at the design luminosity of \(10^{34}\) cm\({}^{-2}\)s\({}^{-1}\) (see Section 3.2).

The straw occupancy must in fact be divided into two components:

1) The dominant component, which we call the bunch occupancy, is induced by hits from particles from a single bunch crossing (at design luminosity there are on average 18 minimum bias events produced per bunch crossing).

This occupancy has to be computed using a detector simulation, which takes into account the significant contributions from loopers and photon conversions (see [8] for a detailed study of such effects using GEANT). This bunch occupancy may be reduced in several ways, listed below (and summarised in Table 7) in decreasing order of effectiveness:

a) Positioning of straws at larger radii. This is the most effective way of reducing both the barrel and the endcap straw occupancies. Not only does the straw hit probability decrease fast with radius as the radius increases in the barrel, but also the large contribution from loopers dies out at a radius of \(\sim\) 80 cm. If the innermost straw radius were increased by 10 cm, from 56 to 66 cm, the corresponding bunch occupancy would decrease from 28% to 22% (line a in Table 7). In the endcaps some reduction could also be obtained but at the expense of rapidity coverage of the straw detector.

b) Shorter straws. This is the second most effective way of reducing the barrel straw occupancy (in the endcaps this approach is identical to the one above since the straws are radial and the dimensions of the inner cavity are fixed). If the straw length would be reduced from 95 cm to 80 cm, the bunch occupancy of the innermost layer would decrease from 28% to 25% for R = 56 cm (line b :n Table 7), and from 22% to 20% for R = 66 cm (line a+b in Table 7).

c) Smaller straw diameter. This may be feasible at least down to a diameter of 3.5 mm, although it is technically a more risky solution. The number

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|c|c|c|c|} \hline \multicolumn{8}{|c|}{Occupancies in \%} \\ \cline{2-7} \multicolumn{1}{|c|}{} & \multicolumn{2}{|c|}{Inermost layer} & \multicolumn{2}{|c|}{Outermost layer} & \multicolumn{2}{|c|}{Average} \\ \hline Option & Bunch & Overall & Bunch & Overall & Bunch & Overall \\ \hline Standard & 28 & 34 & 9 & 11 & 17 & 20 \\ \hline a & 22 & 26 & 9 & 11 & 15 & 18 \\ b & 25 & 30 & 8 & 10 & 15 & 18 \\ c & 25 & 30 & 8 & 10 & 15 & 18 \\ a+b & 20 & 24 & 8 & 10 & 13 & 16 \\ a+c & 20 & 24 & 8 & 10 & 13 & 16 \\ a+b+c & 18 & 22 & 7 & 9 & 12 & 14 \\ a+b+c+d & 18 & \(\sim\) 20 & 7 & \(\sim\) 8 & 12 & \(\sim\) 13 \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 7: **Straw occupancies in the barrel TRT**of channels would increase by \(\sim 15\%\) in the barrel, but by less than 5% for the total, so the cost increase should be modest. The bunch occupancy of the nominal innermost layer would decrease from 28% to 25% (line c in Table 7).

2) Since the time needed to collect the straw signals is longer than the 25 ns between two successive bunch crossings, the bunch occupancies discussed above must be increased by a factor which depends on the probability of hits from the previous or next bunch crossings to be registered as hits in the trigger bunch crossing. This probability depends on many factors such as the total drift time in the straw gas (see Table 4), the signal propagation time along the wire, the pulse width from the shaping amplifier and the logic used to define a hit in a given bunch crossing (discriminator operation and strobe). The largest contribution to this probability arises from the total drift time of 38 ns for the chosen reference gas mixture containing 70% Xe. One could reduce the overall straw occupancy by:

d) The use of a faster gas (see Table 4). For example with a mixture of 50% Xe + 44% CF\({}_{4}\) + 6% CO\({}_{2}\), the total signal collection time is expected to be 30 ns for a straw diameter of 4 mm. The price to pay in this case would be a reduction in the TR-capability of the straw detector. The reduction in occupancy expected from such a faster gas is not uniquely determined, since it will depend on the other factors mentioned above, which also contribute to the overall straw occupancy.

In the following, we therefore describe as an example a possible scheme which minimises the contribution from adjacent bunches to the overall occupancy. This scheme is based on the fact that any particle crossing a straw will produce some dE/dx near the cathode, which means that it will always produce some signal at the largest drift-time values. The presently foreseen front-end discriminator remains activated as long as the shaper output is above threshold. For a discriminator strobe of 10 ns width, fig. 43 shows the probability that the discriminator will fire as a function of the time at which the strobe is sent (the trigger bunch crossing X occurs at time 0), for two different gas mixtures corresponding to total signal collection times of 38 ns and 30 ns. This probability is maximum (\(\sim 95\%\)) for a strobe sent about 35 ns after the bunch crossing time. Fig. 44 shows the expected probability distributions for the two adjacent bunch crossings (X-1 and X+1), which will contribute only moderately during the time where the strobe is open. Figs. 45a (bunch occupancy of 20%) and 45b (bunch occupancy of 40%) show the probabilities of observing a signal above threshold from bunches X, X-1 and X+1 separately and from either X-1 or X+1 as a function of the strobe width. This figure shows clearly that the increase in occupancy expected from adjacent bunches depends on the bunch occupancy itself; this is due to the non-negligible probability of several particles crossing a given straw.

From fig. 45 we can derive the overall occupancy \(\alpha_{tot}\) as a function of the bunch occupancy \(o_{b}\) and the probability \(\epsilon_{adj}\) that the adjacent bunch crossings produce a signal:

\[o_{tot}=o_{b}\cdot[1.+\epsilon_{adj}\cdot(1.-o_{b})] \tag{20}\]

For bunch occupancies of 20% to 40%, \(\epsilon_{adj}\) is 25% to 30% and \(o_{tot}\sim 1.2\cdot o_{b}\). For example, at design luminosity, the overall occupancy of the innermost barrel straw layer is expected to be 34%, for a bunch occupancy of 28%. Table 7 shows the expected bunch occupancies and overall occupancies for the innermost and outermost straw radii in the barrel, as well as the average barrel straw occupancy, for different possible combinations between the options discussed above to minimise these occupancies.

Finally we recall that the occupancies listed in Table 7 are the raw hit occupancies for the straws. The effective occupancy for drift-time hits has been shown to be a factor 2 to 3 lower at the price of a loss of efficiency approximately equal to 0.5 \(o_{tot}\). The occupancy expected for TR-hits is about an order of magnitude less than the raw hit occupancies.

## 5 Conclusions

After several years of intensive research and development efforts, RD6 has reached the following conclusions on straw tube operation at LHC:

1) Kapton straw tubes of 4 mm diameter, reinforced with C-fibres, will operate reliably even at the highest LHC luminosities over a period of more than 10 years. The mechanical and electrical properties of these straws are now well understood and the specifications for the operation of a large straw tube system such as that proposed for ATLAS are now complete.

2) The straw tubes will operate reliably in the ATLAS solenoidal field of 2 T, and their drift-time accuracy has been measured in test beam to be \(\sim\) 150 \(\mu\)m to 200 \(\mu\)m, depending on the exact operating point and on the choice of front-end electronics. This performance has been shown to remain unaffected by the high local particle fluxes expected at LHC.

3) Fully assembled straw tubes have been thoroughly tested for resistance to radiation, both from ionising particles and neutrons, and also for possible loss of performance due to etching or ageing. With the chosen gas mixture and gas gain, no problem is expected for more than 10 years of operation at LHC design luminosity. The occupancy induced by the high neutron f ence expected in the central cavity has been measured and is expected to i: ease only by 10% or less the straw occupancy from ionising particles.

4) Two items of concern remain:

a) The impact of the large ion tails in the straw signals and of possible base-line fluctuations on the straw occupancy and drift-time accuracy at high luminosity;

b) The evacuation of the heat dissipated in the straw gas volume by ionising particles.

5) The occupancy of the straws can be significantly reduced by moving them where possible to larger radius and possibly by shortening the length of the barrel. Smaller reductions in occupancy are expected from reducing the straw diameter and/or using a faster gas. An optimal use of the front-end discriminator output minimises the contribution from adjacent bunches to the straw occupancy.
