1. Introduction

Precision monitoring of the position of all ATLAS detectors is of crucial importance for track reconstruction. Both angular and linear detector position displacement are necessary to record [1]. Here we propose to use for precision measurement (\(\pm\)10 \(\mu\)m) of the detector element linear displacement resistive wire sensing probes. These probes seem to have the following advantages: quite small amount material, tiny volume, possibility to vary easy the length. They can be fixed to detector supports to add practically no material. However, some difficulty might be met due to low signal, which might be spoiled by noise, and temperature dependence of the wire resistance and of a parasitic thermocouple voltage. To investigate above mentioned difficulty a simple test set-up has been constructed and two wire sensing probes have been checked.
2. General

A schematic view of the test device is shown in Fig.1. The wire sensing element (1) is fastened between two levels (2,3) fixed to a rod (4) made of invar alloy. The level (2) can be turned around horizontal axis via string by a load (5) tighteningthe wire under control of a clock indicator (6) with an accuracy better than 2 \(\mu\)m. The second level can be shifted along the rod to adjust a distance between levels to the probe length. The probes have been made of manganin wire 50 \(\mu\)m in diameter. To avoid the pick-up noise and to diminish temperature gradient influence the wires have been folded in two to make loop with minimal area and to have all connections close to each other, and have been put inside of straw tubes made of Kapton film loaded with carbon, 4 mm in diameter [2]. Two types of probes have been checked: in the first one the wire loop ends have been glued to brass cylinders inserted in the tube ends; in the second one the wire loop has been glued to fishing-line 0.35 mm in diameter to increase force that can brake the wire. The additional difference between the probes consist of the following: all bridge circuits elements used for resistance measurements in first case have been put together in one tube, in the second case every bridge element have been put in the individual tubes. The wire loop length has been about 0.52 m. The bridge output voltage has been measured with a digital voltmeter which has sensitivity 0.1 \(\mu\)V. The output voltage as function of wire elongation is shown in Fig. 2 for the first type of probe. In spite of relatively low sensitivity, 2.4 \(\mu\)V/\(\mu\)m, when 5 V voltage was applied to the bridge, the m.s.r. deviation from linearity equals 3.6 \(\mu\)m in elongation range about 0.8 mm, marked in Fig. 2 by crosses. The corresponding maximal load equals 0.1 KG. Approximately the same elongation has been received with the probe of the second type but with load about 1 KG (Fig. 3). The current was registered in this case. The voltage applied to the bridge was decreased to 1 V. The r.m.s. deviation from linearity has been calculated to be 7.3 \(\mu\)m, only two times bigger than in the first case. The influence of temperature instability for the first type probe is illustrated in Fig. 4. The room was cooled artificially down to 12\({}^{\circ}\) C. Quick temperature increase was registered during the first hour (3\({}^{\circ}\)/min see Fig. 5). At 16\({}^{\circ}\) temperature increase became slower resulting to stabilization of the signal within 1 \(\mu\)V.The whole signal change corresponds to 3 \(\mu\)m.
3. **Conclusion** The test results of the wire probes look promising enough to continue further investigation, especially long-term stability. A special bridge circuit made of commercial chips is worth doing.
