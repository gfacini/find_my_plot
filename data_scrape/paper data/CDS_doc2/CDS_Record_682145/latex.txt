Implication of top decay models and \(b\) quark fragmentation on estimate of the \(t\overline{t}\) and \(Zb\overline{b}\) background to \(H\to 4\)_leptons_

L. Fayard, L. Serin

**Introduction**

In the search of an intermediate mass Higgs decaying into four leptons, a preliminary study [1] had showed that the two different schemes used for the top decay and the fragmentation parameters have some implication on the four leptons acceptance and on the inefficiency of isolation cuts against electrons inside a \(b\) jet. In the first part of this note, we compare the different models which can be used for simulation of \(t\overline{t}\) production at LHC with the PYTHIA generator [2], especially the two already used until now. In the second part systematic errors on background estimate are studied by varying some parameters such as the top quark mass, the \(\varepsilon_{b}\) value used in the Peterson function or \(\Lambda_{QCD}\).

## 1 Comparison between models with top meson production and direct top decay

### A brief history

At the time of the Aachen meetings and for the Atlas Letter of Intent, the description of the top decay was not well taken into account, especially gluon bremsstrahlung of the \(b\) quark in the top decay and direct decay of top quark (what was done was the decay of a T hadron) were not included.

On the other hand LEP data had provided some information about \(b\) fragmentation [3]. First the LUND symmetric fragmentation distribution does not reproduce the LEP data, giving a too hard distribution peaking at high \(z\). \(z\) is defined as the fraction of \(E+p_{z}\) taken by a hadron out of the available \(E+p_{z}\).

Secondly the distribution of the beam energy fraction taken by the B meson has been adjusted in two different ways using as fragmentation function the distribution proposed by Peterson et al [4] :

\[F_{q}(z)\propto\frac{1}{z\left(1-\frac{1}{z}-\frac{\varepsilon_{q}}{1-z}\right)}\]In the first way, the perturbative part of the fragmentation (gluons radiation) has been assumed to be correctly given by Monte Carlo simulation so that the \(\varepsilon_{b}\) parameter can be extracted : \(\varepsilon_{b}\) = 0.006. The typical error is about 0.002.(corresponding to an uncertainty of 0.013 on \(z\)[6])

In the second way, gluon bremsstrahlung has not been included in the simulation. The LEP data, although it was not a priori justified, were again adjusted by a Peterson function providing a value about 0.055 for \(\varepsilon_{b}\)[3]. Consequently for the LoI, the simulation was done with a T hadron decay without gluon radiation and a Peterson parameter \(\varepsilon_{b}\) = 0.055. As the fragmentation of the \(b\) quark was not correct, T. Sjostrand has implemented some new top decay posiblities that we have studied.

### 2 Description of the Monte Carlo simulation

#### 2.1 Top meson production

If the top quark mass is lower than 120 \(GeV\), the lifetime is such that hadronization of top quark occurs before it can decay. So a top hadron T is produced which decays into \(Wb\overline{u}\). All the \(t\overline{t}\) generated have the \(b\) and \(W\) decaying into electrons. From this scheme two samples have been produced with the following characteristics :

* As for the LoI, \(b\) quarks do not radiate gluons, and the \(\varepsilon_{b}\) parameter is taken to be 0.055 for the hadronization of the \(b\). (Sample 1). The top quark mass used was 140 \(GeV\). This sample should be in principle the same as the one used for the LoI. Meanwhile the fragmentation was a little bit harder than before because of PYTHIA modifications which were not well identified.
* The bremsstrahlung of \(b\) quarks is included and the \(\varepsilon_{b}\) value is 0.006 (Sample 2). Typically the gluons take around 15% of the transverse momentum of the \(b\) quark. It should be pointed out that in fact the top rarely radiates gluons because of a smaller phase space compared to the \(b\) quark and at a same \(pt\) the top quark has a smaller acceleration than the \(b\) quark.

In these two schemes, the top quark is connected by a string to the remaining beam but not the T hadron so that the \(b\) quark is not connected by a string to the beam. In sample 1, the \(b\) quark is connected to a \(\overline{u}\) quark by a string and the invariant mass of the \(\overline{u}b\) system to be considered for the hadronization is around 8 GeV. In sample 2, gluons have to be added and the invariant mass of the system which fragments is around 10 GeV. The number of particles produced with the \(B\) meson in the hadronization processus depends strongly on this invariant mass. The fact that this invariant mass is limited has two major effects. First it decreases the number of particles produced with the \(B\) meson. Secondly it biases the Peterson \(b\) fragmentation function towards high values as will be shown.

#### 2.2.1 \(b\) Direct top decay

If we assume that the top quark is heavier than 120 \(GeV\), the top decays first in \(W\) and \(b\) quark so that, as the top was connected to the remaining beam by a string, the \(b\) quark retains this string connection to the residual beam. The invariant mass of the system which fragments is then very large, around a few TeV with or without gluon emission. With this hypothesis about top decay, two samples (3 and 4) have been studied with parameters equal, respectively, to those of sample 1 and 2.

In figure 1 we have tried to summarize the properties of the four samples by some diagrams. It has to be reminded that PYTHIA does not include in \(t\overline{t}\) production the topspin correlations.

### Comparison of different samples

For each sample we have checked the fragmentation distribution of the \(b\) quark, the acceptance to four leptons and the inefficiency of isolation cuts against electrons inside \(b\) jets. The corresponding numbers are summarized in table 1.

### Fragmentation of \(b\) quark

To test if the simulation takes well into account the parameter \(\varepsilon_{b}\) of the Perterson function, we can look at the distribution of the ratio of the energy of the \(B\) meson and \(b\) quark presented in figure 2 for sample 1 and 4. Clearly sample 1 is different from the other samples and gives harder fragmentation than expected so that the tranverse momentum of the \(B\) meson and accordingly that of the electron, is greater in the first sample. The reason for this effect is that the invariant mass of the system which fragments is too small and the iterative fragmentation process stops too early. Sometimes only one other particle is produced with the \(B\) meson. The use of Perterson fragmentation distribution in these conditions is not justified and is incorrect. The same effect appears also in sample 2 but with a smaller bias because the invariant mass is a little larger. For the LEP data, the invariant mass to take into account is almost \(m_{2^{0}}\) that is to say clearly greater than the \(B\) meson mass and the Perterson fragmentation is well suited. For the two other samples, we do not find exactly the expected mean value from LEP, but this probably comes from the fact that a cut on the transverse momentum of the electron coming from the \(B\) meson has been applied at 5 \(GeV/c\).

### Acceptance

In order to have enough statistical precision, the definition of acceptance is the percentage of events with 4 leptons (2 electrons and 2 positrons) which fullfills the following requirements:

* \(pt\) > 5 \(GeV/c\)* \(|\eta|<2.5\)

It is not surprising to see the same effect as before because the acceptance is correlated with the fragmentation process. Meanwhile it is interesting to point out that the acceptance is the same for sample 2 and 4 which means that the top decay model gives small uncertainty when gluon bremstallhung is included. Moreover the fact that sample 3 and 4 have also the same acceptance shows that the two different ways from LEP to parametrize the \(b\) fragmentation give indeed similar results, about the \(pt\) spectrum, if the invariant mass of the system which fragments is large enough.

### Inefficiency of isolation cuts

Another important parameter is the inefficiency of cuts used to reject electrons inside a jet. Indeed even if the distributions of the \(pt\) of the lepton are the same, the environment of the electron could be different for each sample. As this study is done at the particle level, we will look only at a rather crude charged isolation. The selected events have one pair of electron-positron coming from \(W^{+}W^{-}\) and another pair coming from \(b\overline{b}\). A event is kept if none of the four leptons has a charged particle of \(pt>2\)_GeV/c_ inside a cone of \(\Delta r=\sqrt{\Delta\eta^{2}+\Delta\phi^{2}}=0.15\) around the electron track. Results show that the inefficiency of isolation depends strongly of the presence or not of gluon bremstallhung. Another way to look at this is to identify the origin of the charged particle which is near the electron. Figure 3 shows the cumulative inefficiency of isolation cuts per electron from \(B\) meson (the inefficiency per event quoted in table 1 is almost the square of the isolation per electron from \(B\)) as a function of the requirement of the nearest charged particles :

* The charged particle comes directly from a \(B\) meson decay.
* The charged particle comes from the decay of a charm meson which was produced with the electron in the decay of the \(B\) meson.
* The charged particle has been produced in association with the \(B\) meson during the process of hadronization of quark \(b\).
* The origin of the particle has not been identified.

Clearly the number of events rejected by a particle produced along with the \(B\) meson during the fragmentation of the system \(b\) quark/beam remnant system is more important in sample 3. In sample 4, about 15% of the \(pt\) of the system to fragment is removed by gluon emission and 70% is taken by the \(B\) meson so that only 15% remains to create particles in the \(B\) direction. For sample 3, the equivalent number is 30%

### Conclusion

The first point is that sample 1 is not realistic and should not be used. As we know that gluon radiation exists, it is also clear that sample 3 can not be fully correct. Neverthless it would be interesting to check with LEP data whether the multiplicity around a lepton in a \(b\) jet is compatible with what is expected from PYTHIA. Relative

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:5]

From this table some conclusions can be drawn :

* The number of expected events does not vary much except for a variation of the top mass where a 20% effect can be observed between \(m_{top}=120~{}GeV/c^{2}\) and \(m_{top}=160~{}GeV/c^{2}\). With increasing top mass, an improved four leptons acceptance, due to high pt leptons. is not completely compensated by the decreasing \(t\overline{t}\) cross section. Although the number of events in each sample has an important statistical error, the four lepton mass spectrum tends towards higher mass with the top mass (figure 5). For example for a Higgs mass of \(125~{}GeV\) the background expected (before isolation) in a interval of \(\pm 5~{}GeV\) will be about \(63\pm 20\) events for \(m_{top}=120~{}GeV/c^{2}\) and \(23\pm 7\) for \(m_{top}=160~{}GeV/c^{2}\).
* As the \(pt\) leptons increase a lot with the mass and as the inefficiency decreases with the \(pt\), the results for different top mass are not surprising (Factor 2 between \(120~{}GeV/c^{2}\) and \(160~{}GeV/c^{2}\)). A modification of the \(\varepsilon_{b}\) or \(\Lambda_{QCD}\) has a relative effect about 10% on rejection power.

### \(Zb\overline{b}\) background

For the LoI, this background was generated using standard Lund fragmentation and gluon bremstallhung for the \(b\) quark. A new simulation was performed with Peterson fragmentation and \(\varepsilon_{b}=0.004,0.006,0.008\). The acceptance with the cuts defined in the LoI and the inefficiency of isolation cuts as already defined previously are quoted in the table 3.

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|} \hline  & Lund & \(\varepsilon_{b}=0.004\) & \(\varepsilon_{b}=0.006\) & \(\varepsilon_{b}=0.008\) \\ \hline Acceptance in \% & \(1.25\pm 0.08\) & \(0.96\pm 0.07\) & \(1.05\pm 0.08\) & \(0.95\pm 0.07\) \\ \hline Inefficiency in \% & \(20.6\pm 1.6\) & \(16.1\pm 1.6\) & \(19.2\pm 1.7\) & \(16.3\pm 1.6\) \\ \hline \end{tabular}

Table 3

As expected the Lund fragmentation gives greater acceptance and inefficiency than the Peterson fragmentation with \(\varepsilon_{b}=0.006\) so that after acceptance cuts and isolation the estimate of background has been overestimated by almost \(30\pm 15\%\). Meanwhile from the three values of \(\varepsilon_{b}\) used, one can estimate a systematic on the background about \(20\%\).

## Conclusion

The difference between the two simulations of \(t\overline{t}\) used in ATLAS are now understood. We suggest to use the scheme of sample 4 ie a direct top decay with gluon bremsstrahlung and \(\varepsilon_{b}=0.006\). The effects of limited accuracy on \(\varepsilon_{b}\) or on gluons emission are negligible for the acceptance and the \(10\%-20\%\) level for the inefficiency of isolation cuts. More important is the effect of the top quark mass on the four lepton spectrum and on rejection. For the Higgs of about \(120~{}GeV/c^{2}\) the number of expected events after acceptance cuts and isolation could be modified by a factor 5. The cut on impact parameter has not been used here but it should probably also be more powerful at \(160~{}GeV/c^{2}\) than at \(120~{}GeV/c^{2}\) and thus it will not improve this ratio.
