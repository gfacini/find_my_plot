M., Sivokolkov S., Sutton M., Tripiana M., Wang M., Watson A., Wileers M., Woehring E.-E., Wu X., Oacan E.,The high number of detector channels, leads to a mean event size of \(\sim\) 1.5 MB. The trigger and data acquisition system (TDAQ) will reduce the incoming rate to \(\sim\)200Hz which is the rate allocated for offline processing.

## 2 The ATLAS High Level Trigger

In the ATLAS experiment, the reduction of the 40MHz incoming rate down to the 200 Hz maximum event data storage rate will be provided through three different trigger levels.

The hardware based first level trigger (LVL1) performs a preliminary rejection using only reduced granularity data coming from the calorimeters and the muon detector. It operates within a latency \(\sim\) 2.5\(\mu\)s, producing an average output rate of 75kHz upper limited to 100kHz. Further event selection is done by the software based second level trigger (LVL2) and event filter (EF), collectively referenced as the HLT. The reconstruction at LVL2 is seeded by the LVL1 result using full granularity of the ATLAS subdetectors, processing data contained in the regions of the detector identified by the LVL1 as regions of interest (RoIs), each correspond to \(\sim\)2% of the detector. The LVL2 is designed to have an output rate less than 2kHz, with a mean processing time of 40ms. The EF, seeded by the LVL2 results, uses more complex reconstruction.

The main two concepts characterizing the event selection at the HLT in ATLAS are the RoI guided and step wise reconstruction. This event selection mechanism reduces the amount of data to be processed at each trigger stage. Another feature of the ATLAS HLT event selection strategy is the early rejection achieved by alternating reconstruction algorithms and the so-called hypothesis algorithms which decide if the candidate fulfills certain identification criteria. The event can be rejected after any hypothesis step.

## 3 Electron and photon selection

Electron and photon reconstruction mainly exploits data coming from the electromagnetic calorimeter and the Inner Detector (ID) tracking systems. The starting point for the electron and photon chains are the triggered LVL1 electromagnetic cluster candidate. The first step in the \(e/\gamma\) chain is a fast clustering algorithm which is seeded by the LVL1 RoIs.In the next step a hypothesis algorithm uses this information to perform preliminary particle identification. In case the event is accepted, the \(e/\gamma\) chain then continues with the EF processing. For electrons track reconstruction is performed in the ID. There are two main tracking algorithms being studied: IDScan and SiTrack[4] which have very similar performances. In the next step, cluster to track association is done using the matching between the cluster positions with the corresponding \(\eta\) and \(\phi\) values of the tracks extrapolated to the calorimeter surface. In the subsequent step a particle identification is done based on the \(p_{T}\) of the track, the \(E_{T}/p_{T}\) ratio and the position match between the calorimeter cluster and the extrapolated track. The EF re-uses the available offline algorithms with more precise calibrations and alignment constants than at LVL2. Electron and photon trigger menus have been set to be fully efficient in all the pseudorapidity region \(0<|\eta|<2.5\).

## 4 Performance of electron and photon trigger

Electron and photon trigger menus have been extensively studied for luminosity L\(\approx 10^{33}cm^{-2}s^{-1}\). It was demonstrated they are well set-up to trigger on events produced at HLT. Table 1 shows the trigger efficiency w.r.t. to the offline selection for a low mass Higgs decaying into two photons selected by either the trigger which efficiently selects photons above a transverse energy of ET=60GeV (g60) or by the trigger which requests two isolated photons selected efficiently with ET\(>\)20GeV (2g20i). In the same table the respective expected background rate is also shown. Table 2 shows the expected electron trigger efficiencies for Z\(\to e^{+}e^{-}\)and for Exotic Gravitons G\(\to ee\) of 500GeV invariant mass.

In March and May 2007 the timing of the LVL2 and EF algorithms were measured in a so-called technical run. During this period the trigger software was run in playback mode on simulated events using a subset of the final HLT farm. Figure 2 show the LVL2 and EF total time measured for accepted events. The LVL2 timing obtained in the technical run in May 2007 was around 100ms with a large RMS. The EF mean processing time was 1.57s. Work is ongoing to improve further the timing performance of the HLT algorithms.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|c||c|c||c|c|} \hline Trigger & \multicolumn{2}{c||}{2g20i} & \multicolumn{2}{c|}{g60} \\ Level & Eff & Rate & Eff & Rate \\ \hline \hline L1 & 96.4\(\pm\)0.5\% & 150 \(\pm\)10 Hz & 92.9\(\pm\)0.4\% & 1200 \(\pm\)80 Hz \\ \hline L2 & 94.6\(\pm\)0.7\% & 5 \(\pm\)1.7 Hz & 86.8\(\pm\)0.6\% & 35 \(\pm\)14 Hz \\ \hline EF & 93.8\(\pm\)0.8\% & 2 \(\pm\)1 Hz & 84.7\(\pm\)0.6\% & 16 \(\pm\)9 Hz \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}

## 5 Strategy at start up

At start-up an initial luminosity of L\(\approx 10^{31}cm^{-2}s^{-1}\) is expected. The start-up trigger menu for electrons and photons has to provide the data samples needed to commission the trigger and detectors and provide useful data to be used for physics analysis. Therefore, a good selection of the physics

Figure 2: Total time for accepted events measured for (a) LVL2 and (b) EFchannels \(J/\Psi\to ee,Y\to ee\), Drell-Yan, \(Z\to ee,W\to e\nu\), and direct photon production will be crucial. The aim is to select events with at least one electron above \(\approx 10\) GeV or one photon above \(\approx 20\) GeV in addition to the relevant double-object triggers, e.g. for selecting \(J/\Psi,Y\), and Z events. As the data as well as the trigger and detector performance need to be understood the trigger selections use loose selection criteria. The photon triggers will use the same loose cuts for the calorimeter based selections. A range of signatures are foreseen in the trigger menu to adapt to running conditions. If the rate is too high triggers with higher thresholds are defined and/or pre-scales can be adjusted. To ensure the selection of important physics channels, redundant triggers are present, for example, a dedicated \(J/\Psi\) trigger. For \(W\to e\nu\), triggers which combine electrons and missing transverse energy are available. With time the trigger and detector performance will be understood and gradually the trigger selections can be tightened and some redundancy triggers can be dropped.

## 6 Conclusions

The ATLAS trigger performance of electrons and photons at low luminosity (L=\(10^{33}cm^{-2}s^{-1}\)) has been discussed. It has been shown the triggers are well set-up for the various physics processes with electrons and photons in the final state. The HLT algorithms have been tested using simulated events in a subset of the final HLT farm. This has been an important test for the timing performance and a final test to ensure the algorithms are set-up for being run in the real HLT online environment.
