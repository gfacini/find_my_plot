###### Abstract

Results of a first assessment on the impact of an upgrade for the LHC machine on the physics potential are reported, considering both the effects on an upgrade in luminosity and of a hypothetical upgrade in center-of-mass energy. These studies are based on the expected performance of the ATLAS and the CMS experiments for LHC. Where the changes in the conditions lead to a significant degradation of the detector performance, ideas for possible upgrades of the detectors are discussed as well.

Introduction

The LHC [1] will define the energy frontier in accelerator based particle physics in a few years from now. After the shutdown of LEP, the emphasis at CERN has moved mostly towards the construction of the machine and of the four experiments. In the context of a study [2, 3] looking at the future of CERN beyond the LHC, the gain in the physics potential to be obtained from an upgrade of the LHC machine (and possibly of the two general purpose detectors) has been investigated in a preliminary way. Other projects under consideration at CERN are a high energy linear electron collider with \(\sqrt{s}\leq 5\) TeV (CLIC [4]) and a neutrino factory complex [5], possibly containing also a muon collider.

This contribution describes the results of a first assessment of such an upgrade of the LHC, concentrating on the gain in the high \(p_{T}\) physics programme to be conducted by the two general purpose detectors, ATLAS and CMS. In the next section, the LHC parameters are summarized and the scenario for a upgrade of the machine luminosity is presented, together with a discussion of the limitations on a larger center-of-mass energy in the LHC tunnel. Then, a brief overview of the LHC physics programme is given, including a short description of the two general purpose detectors. The next section contains the results of the study on the impact of such upgrades on the physics potential. This is followed by a discussion of the implications on the detector performance and first ideas of ways to upgrade the detector to recover the original performance, in areas where a degradation will take place due to the change in conditions.

## 2 Scenarios for upgrading LHC

After reviewing the basic parameters of the LHC machine, two options for upgrades are discussed: increasing the machine luminosity or increasing the center-of-mass energy. The section ends by definining the two scenarios considered for studying the impact on the physics potential.

### Parameters of the machine

The LHC will provide proton-proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy of \(\sqrt{s}=14\) TeV. At the design luminosity (\(L=10^{34}\) cm\({}^{-2}\)s\({}^{-1}\)), the machine will contain 2835 bunches (separated by 25 ns), where each bunch will contain \(10^{11}\) protons. The value of the \(\beta\) function at the interaction point (IP) is \(\beta^{*}=0.5\) m and the normalized transverse emittance at the IP is \(\epsilon=3\)\(\mu\)m.

The protons are bend by superconducting dipoles made of NbTi (operated at 1.9K) with a nominal field of 8.3 T. The total current in the machine amounts to about 0.5 A, the power dissipation due to synchrotron radiation is about 3.7 kW. Despite having a smaller value than at LEP, the synchrotron energy has nonetheless to be removed effectively, in order not to be absorbed in the superconducting elements. This is done by an elaborate beam screen and beam dump system.

### Luminosity upgrade

The luminosity \({\cal L}\) of the machine depends, among others, on the number of protons within a bunch (\(N_{p}\)) and on the value of the \(\beta\) function at the interaction point (\(\beta^{*}\)) according to

\[L\propto\frac{N_{p}^{2}}{\beta^{*}} \tag{1}\]

An increase in the number of protons per bunch beyond the design value of \(N_{p}=10^{11}\) up to a value of \(N_{p}=1.7\cdot 10^{11}\) (which represents the limit due to beam-beam interactions) could provide an increase in \({\cal L}\) of about 2.6. Reducing \(\beta^{*}\) by a factor of 2 would allow to reach luminosities of \(5\cdot 10^{34}-10^{35}\) cm\({}^{-2}\)s\({}^{-1}\). A smaller value of \(\beta^{*}\) would require the installation of new focussing quadrupoles with a larger aperture. In order to reduce the number of inelastic interactions per bunch crossing, the bunch spacing would be reduced at the same time by a factor of 2 to a value of 12.5 ns.

It should be noted that part of such an increase in luminosity should be already attainable after a careful understanding of the machine. Thus one can hope that during the running of LHC, its design luminosity will be exceeded.

### Center-of-mass energy upgrade

An increase in the center-of-mass energy, with the constraint of using the existing tunnel, depends crucially on the availibility of high field dipoles. The LHC dipole design allows for a maximum field of 9 T, this corresponds to \(\sqrt{s}\approx 15\) TeV. Present technology can provide dipoles with fields as large as 10.5 T, which in turn implies a maximum value of \(\sqrt{s}=18\) TeV.

It is important to note however, that the value of the achievable dipole magnetic field might possibly not be the limiting factor. Although the amount of synchrotron radiation at LHC is much smaller than for LEP, it is not negligible and the energy dissipated has to be prevented from hitting the cold parts. The present design of the beam screening system should only allow maximum energies corresponding to a magnetic field of about 10.5 T, i.e. \(\sqrt{s}\leq 18\) TeV.

### Scenarios studied

In order to assess the impact on the physics potential, the following two upgrade scenarios have been considered as input for the physics studies:

* an upgrade in the luminosity by a factor of 10, i.e. \(L=10^{35}\) cm\({}^{-2}\)s\({}^{-1}\). An integrated luminosity of 1000 fb\({}^{-1}\) has been assumed. This scenario will be called SLHC in the following.
* an upgrade in the center-of-mass energy by a factor of 2, i.e. \(\sqrt{s}=28\) TeV, for an integrated luminosity of 100 fb\({}^{-1}\). Although at present it is doubtful whether such a significant increase in the center-of-mass energy can be achieved in the LHC tunnel, this scenario has been chosen as a benchmark for the SLHC case.

In addition, for some aspects also the combination of both upgrades was considered, i.e. \(\sqrt{s}=28\) TeV for an integrated luminosity of 1000 fb\({}^{-1}\).

## 3 LHC physics programme

After a brief description of the two general purpose detectors (ATLAS and CMS) at LHC, some of the precision measurements to be made at LHC are discussed. This is followed by a survey of the discovery potential for new physics at LHC.

### The ATLAS and CMS detectors

The ATLAS [6] and CMS [7] detectors are general purpose detectors with an acceptance close to \(4\pi\). The central part (\(|\eta|<2.5\)) of both detectors has tracking detectors (mostly silicon pixel and silicon strip sensors), fine grained calorimetry and muon detectors. The combination of these detector elements provides an excellent identification and precise measurements of leptons, photons, jets and \(b\)-tagged jets. The calorimetric coverage extends up to \(|\eta|<5\) for measurements of jets and of missing transverse energy. The momentum measurement of charged particles is done using a solenoidal field. In the case of ATLAS, a standalone muon system using air-core toroid magnets is used for muon detection and measurement.

The transverse momentum resolution for 1 TeV muons is \(\sigma(p_{T})/p_{T}=5\) % for CMS (including the tracking detectors), and \(\sigma(p_{T})/p_{T}=7\) % for ATLAS (usingonly the stand-alone muon system). The measurement of jets will be done with an energy resolution of \(\sigma(E)/E=50\)\(\%/\sqrt{E/{\rm GeV}\oplus 3}\)\(\%\) for ATLAS (longitudinal depth of \(\geq 10\lambda_{int}\)) and of \(\sigma(E)/E=95\)\(\%/\sqrt{E/{\rm GeV}\oplus 5}\)\(\%\) for CMS (\(\geq 6\lambda_{int}\) plus a separate tail catcher). The electro-magnetic energy resolution is \(\sigma(E)/E=2-5\)\(\%/\sqrt{E/{\rm GeV}\oplus 0.5}\)\(\%\) for the \(PbWO_{4}\) crystal calorimeter of CMS and \(\sigma(E)/E=10\)\(\%/\sqrt{E/{\rm GeV}\oplus 0.7}\)\(\%\) for the fine-grained LAr calorimeter of ATLAS (which has longitudinal segmentation). The transverse momentum of charged particles will be measured with a resolution of \(\sigma(p_{T})/p_{T}=5\cdot 10^{-4}\cdot(p_{T}/{\rm GeV})\oplus 1\)\(\%\) for ATLAS (2 T solenoidal field) and of \(\sigma(p_{T})/p_{T}=1.5\cdot 10^{-4}\cdot(p_{T}/{\rm GeV})\oplus 0.5\)\(\%\) for CMS (4 T solenoid), where ATLAS has additional electron identification capabilities from a transition radiation straw tube tracker. More details on the detectors and the expected performance can be found in [7, 8]. The production of the various detector components has started and several parts have already been built. As an example, the ATLAS solenoidal magnet has been finished and reached the nominal current. Four rings of the CMS barrel return yoke have been assembled and the mechanical assembly of one half of the hadronic calorimeter is already finished.

### Precision measurements at LHC

The results obtained in run I at the Tevatron have indicated the potential of hadron colliders to perform precision measurements. The LHC physics programme contains (besides searches for new physics) several precision measurements of basic parameters of the Standard Model. Three examples of such measurements are

* required to be known to 0.02 \(\%\) for this measurement).
* The measurement of the \(top\) quark mass to about 1.5 GeV (where the statistical uncertainty contributes only 0.07 GeV and the dominant systematic uncertainty of 1.2 GeV is associated with effects of final state radiation).
* The measurement of the effective lepton mixing angle \(\sin^{2}\theta_{lep}\) to an (statistical) accuracy of \(10^{-4}\)

A more complete overview can be found in [9] with a detailed discussion of the expected statistical and systematical uncertainties. In addition, the experiments are also expected to measure properties of new physics signatures, if they are to be found.

### Discovery potential for new physics

One of the important motivations for LHC is to contribute to the understanding of origin of the electroweak symmetry breaking. A Standard Model Higgs boson will be discovered at LHC with high statistical significance over the entire expected mass range, mostly having several accessible decay modes with large individual significance. Combining the ATLAS and CMS capabilities, with an integrated luminosity of 10 fb\({}^{-1}\) per experiment, a 5\(\sigma\) discovery potential is obtained for Higgs masses above the LEP2 limit up to 1 TeV. In the case of super-symmetric extensions of the SM (such as the Minimal SuperSymmetric Model (MSSM)), the whole parameter space (as a function of \(\tan\beta\) and \(m_{A}\)) will be explored, with at least one of the five supersymmetric Higgs bosons being observable. In most cases, properties of the Higgs boson(s), such as its mass and some decay branching ratios, can be measured accurately. The determination of the SM Higgs width can be made for Higgs masses below 200 GeV, for the case of the MSSM Higgs boson the measurement is much more difficult.

The large center-of-mass energy of LHC (in comparison with Tevatron) will extend the reach in searching for physics beyond the Standard Model significantly. Supersymmetric particles such as squarks and gluinos will be found if they have masses of less than about 2.5 TeV. New heavy gauge bosons such as a \(W^{\prime}\) (\(Z^{\prime}\)) will be found if their mass is below \(\approx 4.5\) (6) TeV, where the exact limit depends on the specific model. Compositeness can be seen directly up to scales of about 40 TeV. Furthermore, signals of large extra dimensions can be observed in a number of scenarios, as well as signals for strong scattering between longitudinally polarized vector bosons (as expected in case of the absence of a Higgs boson), especially in case of a resonant behaviour.

## 4 Impact on physics potential of upgrade scenarios

Based on the two scenarios defined above, the impact of a LHC upgrade is discussed first for Standard Model Physics, followed by issues related to Higgs searches and measurements. Next, the implications for discovery and studies of supersymmetry are presented and finally, an overview of the extended coverage for other physics beyond the Standard Model is given.

As discussed in more detail later, the two scenarios under consideration would have different implications on the detector performance. For an energy upgrade from \(\sqrt{s}=14\) TeV to 28 TeV, the detectors should essentially retain their foreseen capabilites, as the inelastic cross-section will increase only slightly. Thus,the number of inelastic interactions occuring in the same bunch crossing would remain essentially unchanged.

Much more demanding on detectors is an upgrade in luminosity, which would lead to many more inelastic ("minimum bias") events per bunch crossing. The radiation levels and the detector occupancies would increase significantly and would lead to a degradation of the detector performance, mostly for the tracking components. One could envisage two upgrade scenarios for the detectors: first only minor upgrades, which would lead to the loss of good tracking capability and second, a major upgrade mostly of the tracking detectors.

### Standard Model Physics

In general, an upgrade of the luminosity is not expected to bring major benefits to precision measurements of Standard Model observables. These measurements are expected already at LHC to be mostly dominated by systematic uncertainties. In addition, in the SLHC scenario without major detector upgrades, a loss in detector performance is expected. This would lead to significantly worse lepton identification and \(b\)-jet tagging capabilities, which are needed for such precision measurements. As discussed above, the statistical accuracy for many precision measurements is negligible in comparison with the systematic uncertainties (e.g. for the measurement of \(m_{W}\) or of \(m_{top}\)). Most measurement of \(B\)-hadron physics (e.g. to study \(CP\) violation in the \(B\) system) cannot be done when there are more than a few interactions in the same bunch crossing.

For the measurements of jets, an increase in the extreme kinematic reach (about \(3-4\) TeV in \(E_{T}\)) for QCD measurements is expected, which might be useful for constraints of the parton distributions in the proton at very large \(Q^{2}\). In Table 1 the reach in the jet transverse energy for inclusive jet production is shown for the various scenarios.

Obviously, the largest increase would be due to an increase in the center-of-mass energy, however the SLHC would nonetheless provide an increase in reach by about 20 %. For these large \(E_{T}\) values, the increase in the event pile-up noise by a factor of 3 is not going to affect the measurement much.

The reach in jet transverse energy is also of interest in the search for new physics, manifesting e.g.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|} \hline  & LHC & SLHC & \(\sqrt{s}=28\) TeV (100 fb\({}^{-1}\)) & \(\sqrt{s}=28\) TeV (1000 fb\({}^{-1}\)) \\ \hline \hline \(E_{T}(jet)\) & 3.6 TeV & 4.2 TeV & 6.2 TeV & 7.4 TeV \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 1: _Reach in jet transverse energy from inclusive jet production._in terms of compositeness signatures, as discussed below. Having good tracking and thus good particle identification capabilities available for SLHC, measurements of the proton structure using other probes such as \(W/Z\) bosons (with leptonic decays) or photons might be extended to higher \(Q^{2}\) values as well.

### Higgs search and measurements of Higgs properties

As already mentioned, the LHC guarantees discovering the SM Higgs boson over the full relevant mass range. For a \(5\sigma\) discovery, an integrated luminosity of 10 fb\({}^{-1}\) is sufficient, where in the low mass region the ATLAS and CMS results have to be combined. For the case of MSSM Higgs bosons,

Figure 1: _Coverage in the \((m_{A},\tan\beta)\) plane for MSSM Higgs bosons for various decay modes, assuming an integrated luminosity of 300 fb\({}^{-1}\) and the maximal mixing scenario._

\((\tan\beta,m_{A})\) is covered with the observation of at least one of the five MSSM Higgs bosons. In many cases, more than one Higgs will be observed (assuming decays only to Standard Model particles), as can be seen in Fig. 1. The following decays are the most important ones to achieve this coverage: \(h\to\gamma\gamma\), \(h\to b\bar{b}\), \(A/H\to\mu\mu\), \(A/H\to\tau\tau\) and \(H^{\pm}\to\tau\nu\). The region of moderate \(\tan\beta\) and large \(m_{A}\), where only the \(h\) can be observed, will not gain significantly from an increase in statistics, as provided by the SLHC scenario.

Fig. 2 shows two examples of the determination of SM Higgs boson properties, the measurement of its mass and its width. For a not too heavy Higgs boson, its mass should be determined to better than 0.1 %. The width of the Higgs is expected to be measured directly to better than 10 % for \(m_{H}>300\) GeV (and to similar accuracy by an indirect method for some range of smaller Higgs masses). The measurement of production rates (\(\sigma\cdot BR\)) should give an accuracy of \(\approx 10\) % as well, and can be used to deduce branching ratios. Ratios of coupling constants can be derived by studying various production and decay processes to an accuracy of \(10-20\) %. The latter accuracy should be improved in the SLHC scenario to about \(5-10\) % due to the increase in statistics. However a fully functional detector will be needed to achieve this, as accurate lepton identification and \(b\)-tagging are necessary.

The dominant systematic uncertainty for the measurement of the Higgs

Figure 2: _Accuracy on SM Higgs boson parameters (left: mass \(m_{H}\) of the Higgs; right: width \(\Gamma_{H}\))._

mass is the knowledge of the photon or lepton energy scale, for the width determination it is the energy resolution in the lepton measurement. The uncertainties on rate measurements are expected to be dominated by statistics and by the knowledge of the luminosity, whereas, as already indicated, the determination of coupling ratios is going to be mostly statistically limited at LHC.

### Supersymmetry: search and measurements

Fig. 3 shows for a mSUGRA model with \(R_{P}\) conservation, \(\tan\beta=10\) and \(\mu>0\) the discovery reach for squarks and gluinos. The LHC reach of about 2.5 TeV in \(m_{\tilde{q},\tilde{g}}\) is extended by 20 % to about 3 TeV for SLHC. The discovery can be done using only inclusive measurements with signatures of high \(p_{T}\ jets\) and large missing transverse energy (\(E_{T}^{miss}\)), which are at high \(p_{T}\) only little affected by pile-up. In order to be able to reconstruct decay cascades and thus to find other sparticles and to perform precision measurements, however, a fully functional detector is needed. An increase in statistics due to the higher luminosity would be obviously most beneficial for the study of objects with very large masses, leading to signatures with very large \(p_{T}\)\(jets\) and large \(E_{T}^{miss}\) (being less influenced by event pile-up).

Increasing the center-of-mass energy by a factor of 2 would extend the mass reach even further (by 60 %) to about 4 TeV in squark and gluino masses. Here similar capabilities for the reconstruction of decay cascades (and thus the discovery and measurement of other sparticles) can be expected as for LHC, and would thus be more appealing than the previous one.

### Other signatures of physics beyond the Standard Model

#### 4.4.1 Triple-gauge boson couplings

In Fig. 4 the expected sensitivity to anomalous triple-gauge boson couplings is shown for the final states \(W\gamma\) or \(WZ\), where \(W\to l\nu\) and \(Z\to ll\). For the case of \(L=10^{34}\) cm\({}^{-2}\)s\({}^{-1}\), both electron and muon final states are considered (\(l=e,\mu\)). For the luminosity upgrade scenario (SLHC, \(L=10^{35}\) cm\({}^{-2}\)s\({}^{-1}\)), only muon final states have been considered (\(l=\mu\)). This reflects the expected loss of detector performance and thus the significant reduction in the electron identification capabilities, without considering a major upgrade of the tracking detectors. However, still a clear increase in the sensitivity is observed due to the luminosity upgrade, which for most couplings is better than an increase of a factor of 2 in \(\sqrt{s}\). In Tab. 2, the expected reach is summarized for the various couplings.

Figure 3: _Reach for supersymmetry in the \((m_{0},m_{1/2})\) plane (for the CMS experiment) for signatures with \(E_{T}^{miss}\) and \(jets\), in a mSUGRA scenario with \(R_{P}\) conservation._

Figure 4: _Expected limits (for the ATLAS experiment) on anomalous triple-gauge boson couplings for the \(WW\gamma\) vertex (\(\lambda_{\gamma}\) and \(\Delta\kappa_{\gamma}\)) and the \(WWZ\) vertex (\(\lambda_{Z}\), \(\Delta\kappa_{Z}\) and \(\Delta g_{Z}\)). The solid lines correspond to the LHC limits, the dashed lines are for the SLHC scenario. An increase in \(\sqrt{s}\) to 28 TeV is shown using the dot-dashed lines and the combination of \(\sqrt{s}=28\) TeV and 1000 fb\({}^{-1}\) using dotted lines._

It should be noted that these estimates are conservative, as only information on the cross-section and on the \(p_{T}\) distribution of the photon resp. the \(Z\) boson has been taken into account. No usage has yet been made of angular distributions, which are especially important in constraining the \(\kappa\)-type couplings. More details on this study can be found in [10].

#### 4.4.2 Compositeness

Searches for signatures of compositeness can be done using an inclusive jet cross-section measurement as a function of \(E_{T}\). However the jet \(E_{T}\) spectrum is sensitive to the precise knowledge of the energy scale in the TeV region, the size of higher order corrections and to the knowledge of the parton distributions of the proton. The study of angular distributions of di-jet events is less sensitive to these effects. Usually, the variable \(\chi\) is used, which is defined as

\[\chi=\frac{1+\cos|\theta^{*}|}{1-\cos|\theta^{*}|}, \tag{2}\]

where \(\theta^{*}\) is the scattering angle in the di-jet center-of-mass system.

In Tab. 3 the reach in the compositeness scale \(\Lambda_{compositeness}\) is summarized, indicating a significant increase of about 50 % in reach due to a luminosity upgrade. Again, an increase in center-of-mass energy would lead to even larger reach in \(\Lambda_{compositeness}\), increasing the limit by a factor of 2.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|c|c|} \hline  & LHC & SLHC & \(\sqrt{s}=28\) TeV (100 fb\({}^{-1}\)) & \(\sqrt{s}=28\) TeV (1000 fb\({}^{-1}\)) \\ \hline \hline \(\lambda_{\gamma}[10^{-3}]\) & 1.4 & 0.6 & 0.8 & 0.2 \\ \(\lambda_{Z}[10^{-3}]\) & 2.8 & 1.8 & 2.3 & 0.9 \\ \(\Delta\kappa_{\gamma}[10^{-2}]\) & 3.4 & 2.0 & 2.7 & 1.3 \\ \(\Delta\kappa_{Z}[10^{-2}]\) & 4.0 & 3.4 & 3.6 & 1.3 \\ \(g_{Z}^{1}[10^{-3}]\) & 3.8 & 2.4 & 2.3 & 0.7 \\ \hline \end{tabular}

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|c|} \hline  & LHC & SLHC & \(\sqrt{s}=28\) TeV \\ \hline \hline \(\Lambda_{compositeness}\) & 40 TeV & 60 TeV & 85 TeV \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 3: _Reach in the 95 % CL limit on the compositeness scale \(\Lambda_{compositeness}\) from di-jet angular distributions (for the ATLAS experiment)._

#### 4.4.3 Large extra dimensions

The reach for extra dimensions using final states with high \(p_{T}\) jets and large missing transverse energy has been studied using the direct production of gravitons \(G\) via the process \(qg\to qG\).

The limits on the gravity scale \(M_{D}\) given in Tab. 4 represent the values for a \(5\sigma\) discovery. The increase in luminosity for SLHC would lead to a larger reach, typically by \(15-30\) %. Increasing the c.m.s. energy to \(\sqrt{s}=28\) TeV however would lead to an increase by more than 50 %. In addition, the availability of two different values for the center-of-mass energy would allow to disentangle the number \(\delta\) of extra dimensions and the value of \(M_{D}\), as the cross-section depends on these two parameters via:

\[\sigma\propto\frac{1}{M_{D}^{\delta+2}}. \tag{3}\]

#### 4.4.4 New heavy gauge bosons

In Fig. 5 the reach in the mass of a new heavy gauge boson \(Z^{\prime}\) is shown (detection via a di-muon final state) for various values of the branching ratio for \(Z^{\prime}\rightarrow\mu\mu\) relative to the one for the \(Z\) boson (\(Z\rightarrow\mu\mu\)). In the SLHC scenario (assuming the same branching ratio as for the \(Z\)), the reach in the mass of a \(Z^{\prime}\) is extended by about 25 % from 4.6 TeV to 5.8 TeV for a \(5\sigma\) discovery. For the case of \(\sqrt{s}=28\) TeV, the reach is extended significantly further, to about 8 TeV.

#### 4.4.5 Strong \(V_{l}v_{l}\) scattering

In the absence of a Higgs boson, strong scattering of longitudinally polarized vector bosons should occur at TeV scales. The selection of these events requires two forward jet tags and a central jet veto (besides a selection on the decay products of the vector bosons). These tagging cuts are essential in reducing the background from \(W_{T}W_{T}\), \(WZ\) and \(Wt\bar{t}\) production.

In the SLHC scenario, the significant increase in pile-up and in the number of inelastic interactions per bunch crossing significantly deteriorates the jet tagging

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|} \hline  & LHC & SLHC & \(\sqrt{s}=28\) TeV (100 fb\({}^{-1}\)) & \(\sqrt{s}=28\) TeV (1000 fb\({}^{-1}\)) \\ \hline \hline \(\delta=2\) & 9 TeV & 12 TeV & 15 TeV & 19 TeV \\ \(\delta=3\) & 7 TeV & 8 TeV & 12 TeV & 14 TeV \\ \(\delta=4\) & 6 TeV & 7 TeV & 10 TeV & 12 TeV \\ \hline \end{tabular}

efficiency. Work is presently ongoing to optimize this tagging performance in the presence of event pile-up.

## 5 Detector implications

The impact on the detector performance of an upgrade in luminosity is described in this section, starting with a discussion of the changes in the radiation background. Then, the various detector components are examined for their performance under the SLHC conditions and first ideas for detector upgrades, capable of coping with changes in environment, are presented. As mentioned earlier, an increase in the center-of-mass energy would not require significant upgrades of the detectors.

### Radiation background

In Tab. 5, the expected fluxes of charged and neutral particles, as well as the integrated dose (for 2500 fb\({}^{-1}\)) are given for various radial positions in the CMS detector. In comparison with the LHC, the radiation background in the SLHC scenario is increased by at least a factor of 10 and will have to be taken into account, especially in the design of the tracking detectors (see below) or in issues related to the detection of muons.

### Tracking

Relevant figures-of-merit for tracking are the pattern recognition capabilities, the momentum resolution and the secondary vertexing. For LHC, the expected occupancies are about \(10^{-4}\) for the silicon pixel detectors close to the beam pipe (\(r=5-15\) cm), about 1 % for silicon strip detector in the region \(r=15-60\) cm and also about 1 % for the region \(r=70-130\) cm, taking the CMS experiment as an example. These numbers would increase by at least a factor of 5 for the SLHC

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|c|c|c|} \hline  & \(r=7\) cm & \(r=20\) cm & \(r=50\) cm & \(r=100\) cm & FCAL (\(|\eta|=5\)) \\ \hline \hline \(N_{ch}\) [cm\({}^{-2}\)s\({}^{-1}\)] & \(2\cdot 10^{8}\) & \(3\cdot 10^{7}\) & \(10^{7}\) & \(2\cdot 10^{6}\) & \(-\) \\ \(N_{n}\) [cm\({}^{-2}\)] & \(5\cdot 10^{15}\) & \(10^{15}\) & \(2\cdot 10^{14}\) & \(10^{14}\) & \(10^{17}\) \\ \(D\) [Gy] & \(2\cdot 10^{6}\) & \(4\cdot 10^{5}\) & \(10^{5}\) & \(3\cdot 10^{4}\) & \(5\cdot 10^{6}\) \\ \hline \end{tabular}

Due to the increase in occupancies in the SLHC scenario (the average number of inelastic events per bunch crossing is expected to be about 115), one has to go to smaller cell sizes in order to be able to retain the performance. Close to the beam, one could envisage to use silicon sensors with pixel sizes of \(50\times 50\)\(\mu\)m\({}^{2}\) (the present pixel sensor design uses size of \(150\times 150\)\(\mu\)m\({}^{2}\) for CMS and \(50\times 300\)\(\mu\)m\({}^{2}\) for ATLAS), which would be followed at medium radii with \(\mu\)pads or macro-pixels, using possibly the same readout as for the pixel sensors. At large radii, short \(\mu\)strip sensors would be placed.

The increased flux will lead to larger radiation damage. One possibility would be to operate the silicon sensors at 130 \({}^{\circ}\)K, to profit from the Lazarus effect as shown by the RD39 collaboration [11]. Sensors based on diamond could provide an alternative solution. Finally, a frequent and regular replacement of detector elements might be considered as well.

Furthermore, due to the increase in the number of channels to be read out, the cost for the readout electronics per channel will have to be reduced, and at the same time, these electronic components have to be made radiation hard as well.

### Calorimetry

The calorimeter performance depends, among other things, on effects of radiation damage, on the pile-up noise and the capability to use isolation for identification of physics signatures. For the SLHC scenario, the pile-up noise will be increased by a factor of only 3 wrt. the LHC case.

The electro-magnetic calorimeters of ATLAS are based on liquid Argon and should be able to cope with the changed conditions without major problems. For the crystal based e.m. calorimeter of CMS, saturation might become an issue, as well as larger leakage currents in the photodetectors.

For the hadronic calorimetry, the main worry is related to the radiation damage of plastic scintillators (where at \(|\eta|=3\) a dose of 10 Mrad is expected). CMS could foresee regular replacements for the endcap calorimeter. For the forward calorimeter the use of quartz-quartz fibers (instead of quartz-plastic fibers) or a periodic replacement could be envisaged. ATLAS uses scintillator based calorimetry only in the barrel region (liquid Argon based in the endcap and forward parts) and should be able to continue operating these components, apart from space charge effects, which might become relevant for the forward calorimeter.

### Muon detection

The expected rate of hits produced due to the flux of neutrons and photons at a value of \(|\eta|=2.4\) is \(10^{4}\) cm\({}^{-2}\) s\({}^{-1}\) at LHC and would increase by a factor of 10 in the SLHC scenario. Such additional hits in the muon detectors can compromise the pattern recognition and thus the muon identification and measurement capabilities, in addition the trigger efficiency might be influenced as well.

The ATLAS muon system (with an open geometry) is designed to operate under \(n/\gamma\) fluxes due to luminosities of up to \(2\cdot 10^{34}\) cm\({}^{-2}\) s\({}^{-1}\) (in addition, a safety factor of 5 is added). If this were not sufficient to cope with the conditions of the SLHC scenario, the shielding around the beam pipe could have to be increased, at the price of having a reduced acceptance (in the forward region).

For CMS, the muon system is based on a closed geometry, where a safety factor of 3 has been used for the design. Photon irradiation studies indicate that for a rate 10 times larger than the design values, the efficiency would drop only by a few %. A possible further measure would be to restrict the acceptance to e.g. \(|\eta|<2\).

Restrictions of the acceptance for muon detection in the forward region would not degrade the increase in physics potential very much, as the emphasis would in any case be on high \(p_{T}\) central objects, with typical \(p_{T}\) values larger than the ones for LHC.

### Summary

Based on the above discussion of the detector implications and of the physics reach to be achieved in the SLHC scenario, an increase in the luminosity of up to a factor of 10 could first be exploited without having good tracking capabilities, thus relying mostly on calorimetric and muon measurements. This would only require modest upgrades of the trigger and data acquisition systems, as well as of the readout electronics.

To fully benefit from such a machine upgrade, one would however have to restore a detector performance similar to the one for the LHC baseline design by performing a major upgrade in the tracking detectors. It should be noted, that for such an upgrade, an extensive R&D program would have to be initiated rather soon. Further advances in technology might lead to a revised approach to the triggering in hadron collisions.

Conclusions

The SLHC scenario of a luminosity upgrade by a factor of up to 10 would increase the reach in mass and scale of physics beyond the Standard Model by typically \(20-30\) %, while not bringing major benefits to precision measurement within the Standard Model (unless major detector upgrades would be made). Such an increase in the physics reach could be obtained in a first stage without major detector upgrades. However, in order to fully profit from such a machine upgrade, fully functional detectors with the capabilities of ATLAS and CMS (as designed and being build for LHC) would be needed. This would allow to perform precision measurements for various aspects of new physics. In order to be able to perform such upgrades, a research and development program would have to be launched (soon), primarily in order to be able to provide adequate tracking capabilities.

Obviously, a significant increase in center-of-mass energy (at least by a factor of 2) would be the preferred option, if new physics was only to show up at large scales or masses. Such a machine upgrade would put much less demands on detector upgrades, since the available ATLAS and CMS experiments should be able to operate with similar performance as for the LHC design luminosity case. The most uncertain question in this context is whether a significant upgrade in the center-of-mass energy could be obtained in the LHC tunnel. The major constraint, besides the availibility of high field dipoles, is likely going to be the size of the synchrotron radiation power.
