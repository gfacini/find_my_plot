**Abstract: This note summarizes the technical specifications of the prototype of the photomultipliers dedicated test-bench which had been mounted in Clermont. In the introduction, we reminds briefly what are the main constraints on the design of the PMT test-bench. Then we give a general description of the set-up. Third part describe the PMT box. Fourth section concerns the light sources. Then the special Voltage dividers used in the measurements are presented. Section 6 reviews all the electronics components of the test-bench. Section 7 explains the intercalibration of the light channels. Section 8 give some examples of automatic measurements and show their results. After conclusions, the main technical informations are given in section 10. Finally test bench photographs and detailed diagrams are given in section 11 and 12Introduction.

As in the final configuration, the TILECAL will use about 10000 photomultipliers, it is clear that each of these phototubes has to be tested first to know its own characteristics, and eventually to eliminate those that do not fulfill the required specifications. It is foreseen that this task will be done by 5-7 dedicated test benches in different institutes. This document describes a first prototype of such a dedicated test bench. Following experience we get from previous laboratory tests of the R5900 phototubes, especially for Module 0, it appears clearly that the design of the PMT test bench should fulfill some constraints:

* The different test benches should be completely identical. This imply that each of this component should be also identical. This is obvious for commercial products (filter, LED, optics). For home made components (mechanics, electronic circuits), they should be done only in one place, and multiply by the correct number to equip all the test benches (including spares). The same argument is also valid for the measurement method and procedures
* The whole test procedure should be automatic.The interest of the automation of the procedure is that it makes possible to check about 20 photomultipliers per week and per test bench, and to achieve the photomultipliers characterizations in a rather limited schedule.
* The test bench should be as cheaper as possible. This imply to use standard and robust components

The tests are classified into DC light tests and pulsed light tests with an addition or not of DC light (to reproduce the effect of pile up). With the DC light source, we simply study the photomultiplier in measuring its dark current, its gain, etc. This first step doesn't correspond to the real conditions in the ATLAS calorimeter, but must help to rapidly classify the photomultipliers when considering their intrinsic characteristics. The worst will be eliminated or they will be placed in some not crucial places in the calorimeter. In the second step, we test pairs formed by a photomultiplier and its divider, as they will be assembled in the final experiment in the LHC. With the pulsed light, we also test the photomultiplier operating in conditions close to the real conditions of the experiment.

At this moment, we have verified that the different steps work correctly and are automatically executable. We describe the measurements than we plan to perform, the used configuration and methods.

## 2 General Description

### 2-a Planned Measurements

We define two kinds of measurements and we refer to them by **STEP1** and **STEP2**. In **STEP1**, the phototubes will be operated with **DC light** and we do the following measurements :

* **collection efficiency**; i.e. measuring the photocathode current for a given light and varying the voltage between the photocathode and the first dynode.The corresponding curve allows to detect abnormal behavior in the first stage of the photomultiplier.

## 2-b A WEEK OF WORK

All these measurements can last a week of work.In this case and with six test benches, we are able to test ten thousands PMTs in about **two years**. We give below an example of what could be the schedule for a week

## 3 The PMT Box

### 3-a PRINCIPLE

The PMT box is a light-tight and thermo-regulated box that could contain up to 24 phototubes to test. These PMTs are placed on a 5x5 matrix in front of corresponding light-mixers.On each light-mixer we bring pulsed light and DC light with two 1mm diameter plastic fibers.All these fibers are grouped in two bundles leading to optical connectors.The light comes from the two light generators via liquid fibers.

Furthermore, with a system of stepper motors we can move a photodiode placed in the center of the matrix above each light mixer.In this way we are able to intercalibrate the channels and to apply corrective coefficients to compensate the discrepancies coming from the curvature,length and polishing of the plastic fibers.

As we have two kinds of measurements - STEP1 and STEP2 - it is convenient to have also two corresponding dedicated grids to prepare quietly the positioning and connecting of the photomultipliers outside of the PMT BOX before each of the both steps

## 3-b Grid for Step1

As explained before,in STEP1 we use special dividers to work in photocathode mode and in anode mode.These dividers will be described further in details (section 5).The switching between the two modes is made with the use of relays. We need to supply the dividers with a voltage varying from 0 Volt to +100 Volt and +5 Volts to control the relays.And for each photomultiplier we have to measure DC currents. A twisted flat cable with a 50 pins connector is used to extract the phototubes currents. A flat cable with 20 pins connector is used for the special dividers command. We also put a dummy connector to maintain in proper place the unused connections.

### 3-c Grid for Step2

As mentioned before,the grid #2 is intended mainly for pulse measurements and using standard dividers.We have only to provide the HV.

The 24 signals go out of the PMT BOX via coaxial cables (RX 21 A) using a transformed 50 pins connector for flat cable. In this way we have only one manipulation to install this grid #2 at the expense of small reflections.

The cables are then connected on Lemo connectors outside of the PMT BOX.

As for grid #1, we put a dummy connector to maintain in proper place the unused connections.

## 3-d Photodiodes inside the PMT box

Beside the photodiode in the center of the matrix, two photodiodes are monitoring the light coming from the light generators.For this purpose we have set apart a few fibers from each bundle.

For each bundle, the square shape is the most adapted to the light-mixer in order to receive as much light as possible.We adopt a bundle of 6x6 fibers. Hence, 12 fibers are left for the photodiodes

\(\bullet\) 2 for the central photodiode,

\(\bullet\) 10 for the monitoring photodiode to increase the sensitivity in particular for the pulsed light

The dimensions of the corresponding light-mixer are 6.5x6.5x30 (in millimeters).

## 3-e Temperature Regulation

We use four Peltier elements to lower the temperature of the box around 20 degrees Celsius.A thermistor in a Wheatstone bridge provides the temperature information to regulate the box.Furthermore a few temperature sensors will be placed at different places at the level of the PMTs to verify its homogeneity.Two fans can improve this homogeneity particularly after the opening of the box.

### 3-f XY TABLE

The movements of the XY table are controlled by two stepper motors.One is bound to the table and therefore is located inside the box.It is powered only when we use it (e.g. for intercalibrating the channels).

Two switches can provide status bits for reference points X0 and Y0.

## 4 Light Sources

Two blue LED from Ledtronics are used for the generation of the pulsed light and the DC light.As we can see on the luminous spectrum, it yields a **mean value** near 480 nanometers.

### 4-a Pulsed Light

To mimic the pulses in the calorimeter we want to obtain pulses of 15 to 20 ns with a number of photoelectrons up to more than 50000.The LED is driven by a pulse,the amplitude of which is programmable up to 60 Volts.

The beam coming from the LED passes through a first lens and is shared in two parts by a beam splitter. A small amount of the light is monitored by a photodiode. The main part is focused on a liquid fiber by another lens. The liquid fiber has a few advantages :

* the LED is not a point-like source,hence the image on the fiber has an extension and it is easier to focus on its 5 mm diameter.
* the numerical aperture is bigger than for a classical fiber :it corresponds to an angle of nearly 60 \({}^{\circ}\) instead of 35 \({}^{\circ}\).
* the transmittance for visible light is around 98 %10 neutral filters mounted on a motorized wheel yield given different attenuations. As the light does not strike the filters perpendicularly, each attenuation factor must be calibrated. For this purpose we can switch from the pulse mode to a DC mode on the LED and make a precise calibration with the DC photodiode in the center of the matrix inside the PMT box. In the same way we are able to intercalibrate the 24 pulsed light channels.

When speaking of 10 filters we include the position without filter and the one with a * black filter * that we use to measure pedestals. In this way we can suppress the light without turning off the LED to avoid problems of warming up.

An optointerrupter can detect an hole on wheel diameter, giving so a reference point for the stepper motor.

## 4-b DC LIGHT

The DC light system exhibits almost the same configuration. There are two differences :

* we interpose an interferential filter to select very precisely the wavelength.
* the number of filters is only five the five filters are:

* no filter,
* * black filter *,
* three filters to superimpose DC light in STEP2,

one filter has an attenuation of about 1000 for the gain measurement in STEP1

In STEP1 we want to be able to switch between two configurations :

* photocathode mode
* anode mode

This can be done using relays. Using semi-conductors component would be not satisfactory, since we need a very high electrical insulation and we have to manage with potentials up to 1000 Volts. Nevertheless the lifetime of this kind of relay is around \(10^{6}\) actions and any problem arise from this point.

Usually in the photocathode mode, the dynodes are tied together.Too many relays would be necessary to realize the switching. We have measured that we obtain the same behavior keeping them at the same potential through the resistors of the divider as long as we let open the connection between the last dynode and the ground.

In this case we need now only three relays

Relay #1 allows to remove the HV and to isolate the dividers from each other. Relay #2 switches the +100 Volts on the dynode #1 and in the same time the current measurement in the photocathode.

When Relay #3 is open, all the dynodes rise at the same potential for the photocathode mode.

It is important to take notice that we cannot switch off all the relays simultaneously.It is mandatory to introduce a delay between each action.

**To set the anode mode :**

1) close the contact of Relay #3,else you will apply HV between dynode #10 and anode.

2) switch Relay #2 to disconnect the +100V and to put the current measurement on the anode.

3) close the contact of Relay #1 to apply the HV

**To set the photocathode mode :**

1) open the contact of Relay #1.

2) switch Relay #2

3) open contact of Relay #3

6-a-2 THE SLOW ADC

This module can perform 12-bit resolution A/D conversions on up to 64 channels in different modes :

* single channel conversion,
* repeated conversions on one channel,
* conversions on sequential channels,

The voltage input ranges are jumper selectable and its gain (1,2,4 or 8) is adjusted by the program during STEP1.This figure shows how we can use it.

**6-a-3 THE CHARGE ADCs**

We use LeCroy 1182 charge ADC. It offers 12-bit resolution with a sensitivity of 50fC per count on 8 channels.Hence we need three of them for the 24 PMTs and one for the two pulsed photodiodes (the photodiode near the pulsed LED and the one inside the PMT box monitoring the light coming out of the liquid fiber).

As the signal of the photodiodes may be longer than for the photomultipliers,we have to provide two different gatesThe following figure gives the general principle of the electronics in STEP2. DC light source shown in this figure, is needed to simulate effect of the pile-up.

To simplify the cabling at the level of the DIO and the ADC,we have introduced a patch panel.

## 6-b Nim Electronics

We use the following circuits for

* HV
* programmable voltages
* securities on the voltages
* I / V conversion (2 circuits )
* pulse/DC/attenuation switchings
* logic of acquisition in pulse mode
* supplies for the photodiodes

### 6-b-1 Hv

Depending of the high voltage,each divider can sink up to 300 microamperes, hence we need to supply a total current of at least 7 mA at 900 Volts.Furthermore this High Voltage supply must be remotely controlled.

This is the case of the module CAEN model N 472 which is a double width NIM unit.It provides four channels of 3 mA and the settings of the high voltages are remotely controlled by analog levels.

An other solution is to develop his own unit around a commercial module operating from a low voltage.A few companies develop such products (for example the 2478 serie from Brandenburg,designed to operate from a 24 dc supply and yielding 10W 1KV and programmable by voltage ).It is even not necessary to foreseen a display, since we use LabView.

An other solution for people already in possession of a LeCroy HV4032 system is to use the remote mode.In our case we use a current loop in one NIM unit connected to the RS232 of the PC.

### 6-b-2 Programmable voltages

The three others voltages to program are:

* +100V,voltage to apply between the photocathode and the first dynode in STEP1
* +60V,voltage for the pulsed LED
* +15V,voltage for the DC LED

The first two voltages are made from a +120V supply and the +15V is made from the +24V of the NIM crate. The circuit takes up one NIM unit.

6-b-3 SCURITIES

All the voltages must have the possibility to be turn ON or OFF by program. Under no circumstances, the HV and +100V cannot not be present simultaneously on the special dividers in STEP1.

## 6-b-4 1/ V Conversion

As explained before, we need to measure the DC current of the 24 photomultipliers and three photodiodes ( the photodiode in the center of the matrix, the monitoring photodiode near the DC LED and the photodiode monitoring the DC light at the output of the corresponding liquid fiber).

This current measurement is done by first converting the current to a voltage by a I / V conversion circuit according to a classical scheme with an operational amplifier. Since in our measurements, we have only to manage with DC levels,we have chosen JFET operational amplifiers (TL083).The eventual drift of the offset will be eliminated by the acquisition of a pedestal.

Furthermore,to measure these DC levels,we can filter the noise by taking the average of a lot of events in a few seconds.

Since the currents to measure can be very different, we can change the conversion gain of the I / V conversion (expressed in ohms) by switching between two values of resistors.

The conversion circuits are grouped by 24 channels in one NIM unit.

The currents go from the PMT box to the I / V conversion circuit via a 50 wires,4 meters long,flat cable (25 twisted pairs).Then the corresponding voltages are sent to the ADC via a similar, (25 twisted pairs) 50 centimeters long,flat cable.

The three channels for the photodiodes are similar but inside the PMT box.

In STEP2,we measure again the dark current and for this purpose we use an other unit of this I / V conversion circuit.

### 6-b-5 Pulse/dc/attenuation switching for step 2

In STEP2, we perform mainly pulse measurements. Nevertheless,since we have to measure the dark current, it is necessary to switch between a pulse mode and a DC mode.Furthermore,in pulse mode, it is useful to be able to change the attenuation before the charge ADC in order to increase the range of the measurements.

We have tried to use analog switches but we have found that they had a few drawbacks :

* they introduce more noise than the relays
* they have a leakage current making difficult the measurement of less than 1 nA (for dark current )
* they have non linearities when using them as a
* short circuit
* for the pulse measurements,for pulses of a few volts
* they presents a dispersion of a few ohms on the ON impedance.

Hence we use relays.The switching is under the control of two bits of the DIO.

### LOGIC of Acquisition for Pulse Mode

To be comparable, the measurements in pulse mode must be done always at the same frequency. Hence we use a quartz oscillator to generate the pulses and obtain a frequency of 1000 Hz. We have also to generate a pulse for the Light Diode Driver part, and two gates, one for the photomultipliers and the other for the photodiodes. See diagram of section 6-a-3

It seems also possible to reconstruct roughly the shapes of the PMT signal by displacing the gate against the signals with a step of 1 ns. The figure below gives an example for one PMT where we have acquired a few thousands of events for each nanosecond and taken the average for each point. The derivative gives then the original shape

The real pulse The same as reconstructed with LabView

## 6-b-7 Supplies for Photodiodes and Others

The 3 photodiodes inside the PMT box need to be supplied with + and -

12V.Furthermore the special dividers need a buffer between them and the outputs of the DIO controlling the relays. These buffers should also be supplied. A NIM unit is dedicated to this purpose.

Finally the NIM crate could look like below :

## 6-b-8 Supplies for the PMT Box and Filter Wheel

In a special crate are put together the supplies for the XY stepper motors and the Peltier elements ( 30V), and the supplies for the filter wheels (+12V).Except for the Peltier elements, these supplies can be turned ON or OFF under the control of the DIO.This is made necessary because the stepper motors spent a lot of power when they are not turning.

In the same crate is located the +120V supply ( generating +100 and +60V)

## 7 Calibrations

### 7-a Inter-Calibration of the Channels

As explained before,the light intensity is not equally distributed between each channel, because of the differences of length, curvature, and polishing of the fibers inside the box. So, it is very important to inter-calibrate the different channels in the test bench. We must be able to compare the results obtained with a photomultiplier to the other ones. This is done by a large area (18x18 mm) photodiode which scans all the light mixers. It gives a vector of corrective factors to apply to the different measures on each channel, to have comparable results between channels. All the programs which achieve such an automatic inter-calibration had been tested, and we have a first estimation of the light intensity on each channel.

## 7-b Calibration of the FILTER WHEELS

The attenuation factors of the filters must be precisely calibrated. For this purpose we measure them with a DC light in each case. This gives more precise values,since in pulse mode we are limited by the signal on noise ratio.Hence we have added on the pulse LED a possibility to switch it in DC mode by program (the corresponding DC voltage has no need to be programmable).

To improve the precision,the calibration of the filters is made several times. Below, we show the result of six successive measurements for the ten position filters wheel (pulsed light),which is used to perform the tests of linearity in STEP2.

\begin{tabular}{c c c c c c c c}  & & & & & & & mean & relative error(\%) \\
84,68 & 84,68 & 84,67 & 84,65 & 84,51 & 84,51 & 84,62 & 0,1 \\
30,98 & 31,03 & 31,01 & 30,88 & 31 & 30,93 & 30,97 & 0,2 \\
10,03 & 10,06 & 10,05 & 10,06 & 10,07 & 9,99 & 10,04 & 0,3 \\
4,88 & 4,86 & 4,88 & 4,88 & 4,86 & 4,86 & 4,87 & 0,2 \\
4,14 & 4,13 & 4,14 & 4,14 & 4,14 & 4,14 & 4,14 & 0,1 \\

1,22 & 1,22 & 1,22 & 1,22 & 1,22 & 1,22 & 1,22 & 0 \\ \end{tabular}

The two others locations are :

\(\bullet\) no filter (no attenuation)

\(\bullet\) black filter (infinite attenuation for the pedestals)

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:27]

Below is an example of what can be done automatically.

## 8-b STEP2

In STEP2 we pair a standard divider and a PMT and we measure in pulse mode

* the gain
* the linearity
* the dark current
* the linearity with superimposed DC light

To determine the gain,we measure the mean <M> and the standard deviation \(\sigma\). The gain is estimated by the usual method :G = Q / (Npe \({}^{*}\) e\({}^{*}\)), where Npe is the number of photoelectrons estimated by :Npe = ((<M> - ped) / \(\sigma^{2}\)), where ped is the pedestal. The following figure gives an example of an automatic measurement.

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:29]

The corrected estimation of the number of photoelectrons is then :

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|} \hline H/ & Acs.revol.be & OracleID & risefactor & G & IInA \\ \hline
40 & 1609 & 2802 & 04637 & 1849836 & 0010839 \\ \hline
40 & 1866 & 2397 & 0707 & 339969 & 0010375 \\ \hline
50 & 1830 & 2812 & 0738 & 783465 & 0010842 \\ \hline
50 & 1830 & 2405 & 07618 & 1767,1371 & 00104987 \\ \hline
60 & 19146 & 2408 & 07812 & 3643,888 & 00104531 \\ \hline

70 & 2043 & 2821 & 08224 & 2337684 & 00104689 \\ \hline \end{tabular}

One can see clearly the amelioration.

To look at the linearity, we compare in bottom-left figure the amplitudes of the signals coming from the photomultipliers as a function of the nominal attenuation of the filters obtained with the photodiode (black symbols) with what could be expected assuming that the four first points correspond to a full linear behaviour of the photomultiplier and extrapolating this approximation (open symbols). Relative difference, i.e., the non linearity is shown as a function of 1/att in top-right figure

## 9 Conclusion

* The planned measurements can be done automatically.
* The duration of each measurement is compatible with a week of work.
* The repeatability of the measurements is good.
* LabView seems adequate for this kind of work except to manipulate large arrays such as we need with the charge ADC, where it is rather slow.This problem must be solved by developing special modules in C.
