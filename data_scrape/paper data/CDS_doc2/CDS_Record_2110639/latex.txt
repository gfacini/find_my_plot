The ATLAS IBL Collaboration

###### Abstract

During the long shutdown between Run 1 and Run 2 of the LHC, a fourth, innermost, Pixel Detector layer has been installed in the ATLAS experiment: the Insertable B-Layer (IBL). The purpose of the new layer is to add redundancy despite possible failures of the innermost layer, the B-layer, caused by radiation effects, to ensure high quality tracking and improve the flavor tagging performance at higher luminosities. New pixel silicon detector modules have been produced and loaded onto support structures known as staves. A total of 20 staves have been assembled. Procedures and results of the stave loading process are presented in this note.

## 1 Introduction

After two years of successful operation, the peak luminosity of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC [1]), will be gradually increased to \(2\cdot 10^{34}\) cm\({}^{-2}\)s\({}^{-1}\). To cope with the new peak luminosity and detector aging while maintaining the physics performance, an upgrade of the ATLAS [2] Pixel Detector [3] has been performed during 2013 and 2014, in the first long shutdown (LS1) scheduled for the LHC machine.

Taking advantage of the shutdown, the Pixel Detector was extracted from the experiment and brought to surface to equip it with new Service Quarter Panels (nSQP), to repair, when possible, modules and to ease the installation of a new innermost layer, the Insertable B-Layer (IBL) [4, 5]. The IBL is a crucial component to guarantee an excellent track and vertex reconstruction performance and to provide redundancy in case of failures or radiation damage in the other three layers of the Pixel Detector. The IBLis composed of 14 carbon fibre and carbon foam supports, the _staves_, with an embedded titanium cooling pipe. The staves are instrumented with 20 pixel silicon sensor modules each and are symmetrically arranged around the beam pipe. Twenty staves have been assembled in the production phase, between March 2013 and February 2014.

In this document the stave assembly procedure is presented. An overview of the stave is given in Sec. 2, the description and the results of the reception tests on the stave components follow in Sec. 3 and Sec. 4, the stave loading procedure is presented in Sec. 5 while Sec. 6 illustrates the outcome of the stave quality check.

## 2 Stave description

An IBL stave is composed of a support structure (i.e. the bare stave), the instrumentation which is loaded onto it (i.e. the silicon sensors and the readout electronics) and the stave flex (i.e. a flexible Kapton circuit board that hosts the electrical connections between the silicon sensor modules and the services). The constituents of a fully loaded IBL stave and its layout are presented below.

### Bare stave

A bare stave, see Fig. 1, consists of two carbon fibre laminates, carbon foam and a titanium cooling pipe. The carbon fibre laminates are the external parts of the bare stave and provide stiffness and mechanical support. The top laminate is devoted to the gluing of the stave flex (see Sec. 2.3), while the bottom one, simply referred to as _face-plate_ in the following, is devoted to host the modules (see Sec. 2.2).

Since carbon fibre is electrically conducting, a 5 \(\upmu\)m thick layer of Parylene1 is deposited on the face-plate in order to provide electrical insulation between the sensors. The top laminate hosts the carbon foam which acts as a heat exchanger between the cooling pipe and the carbon laminates itself while keeping low the material budget. The titanium cooling pipe is hard bonded to the carbon foam by using epoxy resins, so that an optimal thermal exchange between the two is possible. All the support system, including the cooling line, corresponds to less than 0.6% X/X\({}_{0}\).

Footnote 1: Parylene, Comelec SA.

### Modules

An IBL module is the ensemble of a pixel silicon sensor, one or two (depending on the sensor type) custom front-end read-out chips and a double-sided, flexible Kapton printed circuit board (PCB). Two different technologies of pixel silicon sensors have been chosen for the IBL: planar n\({}^{+}\)-in-n manufactured by CiS2[6] and 3D n\({}^{+}\)-in-p manufactured by FBK3[7] and by CNM4[8]. Given the hard radiation environment and the occupancy constraints that IBL will face, a new read-out front-end, chip has been developed: the FE-I4[9]. The sensors and the read-out electronics are assembled via bump-bonds[10]. Planar sensors have 160 columns \(\times\) 336 rows pixels arranged in 250 \(\times\) 50 \(\upmu\)m and are bump-bonded to two FE-I4 chips, while 3D sensors have 80 columns \(\times\) 336 rows pixels arranged in \(250\times 50\) um and thus necessitate of only one FE-I4 chip to be operated.

Sensor sizes are reported in Tab. 1. Note that planar modules have two different types of pixels: normal and long ones. Long pixels are located in the edge areas (overlapping with the guard rings) and in the central region, in correspondence of the gap between the two FEs, in order to minimize dead areas. The Kapton PCB, also known as _module flex_, hosts lines devoted to the powering, communication, monitoring and timing of the FE-I4 chips. The module flex is glued on the back of the sensor and is connected to the sensor and to the readout electronics by wire bonds and hosts surface mounted devices (SMDs) that allow operations such as high pass filtering for the high voltage lines.

### Stave flex

Two symmetric multilayer flexible circuits, so-called _stave flexes_, are glued on the stave top laminate, each one covering a half of the stave. The stave flexes ensure the connection between the stave modules

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{l c|r|r|r} \hline \hline  & & planar & FBK & CNM \\ \hline thickness & [μm] & 200 & 230 & 230 \\ \hline width & [mm] & 41.315 & 20.450 & 20.440 \\ \hline length & [mm] & 18.584 & 18.745 & 18.740 \\ \hline gap & [μm] & \multicolumn{2}{c|}{205} \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}

and the so-called the type 1 cables. Each stave flex has 4 Low Voltage supply lines (each serving 4 FEs in parallel), 4 NTCs lines, 32 LVDS pair lines (16 for data, 8 for clock and 8 for TTC i.e. Timing Trigger Control) and 4 High Voltage supply lines (each serving 2 DC or 4 SC modules and qualified for up to 1.5 kV). The stave flex is formed by a longitudinal section with 16 wings originating on one side, it has a length of 528.44 mm and the section where wings are located is about 350 mm long and 11.5 mm wide. The inter distance between the wings is 20.75 mm, each wing is 17.5 mm long and 12.0 mm wide. The stave flex supports a bandwidth of 160 Mb/s. The round trip voltage drop across the dedicated Low Voltage lines does not exceed 400 mV and the material budget is lower than 0.2% X/X\({}_{0}\). As the wings need to be bent at 180\({}^{\circ}\) to be glued on the modules, a row of small holes is pierced between the metallic lines to make the Kapton layer more suitable for bending. Eight Panasonic AXT540124 connectors allow the link of the stave flex to the other part of the IBL services. For the stave loading tests and for the stave quality assurance a dedicated PCB was installed at the end of the stave flex.

### Stave layout

The different layers of the stave assembly are shown in Fig. 2.

Fig. 2a shows one extremity of a stave. Beyond the titanium cooling pipe, the stave flex and the face-plate, it is also shown one of the two stave end-blocks, which are located on the two sides of a stave and act as a central fixations for the stave once this is loaded on the IBL support structure. Fig. 2b shows the thermal grease and the glue dots that are deposited on the bare stave face-plate. The thermal grease ensures a good thermal contact between the bare stave and the modules, so that the heat generated can be dissipated. The glue dots, on the other hand, keep the modules in place while keeping low the material budget. The read-out FE chips (see Fig. 2c) lie on top of the thermal grease layer. The sensors are located on top of the FE chips and are connected to the FEs via bump-bonds (see Fig. 2d). Fig. 2e illustrates the module flex glued on the back side of the sensors; SMD components are visible. The stave flex is visible in Fig. 2a and the stave flex wings are visible in Fig. 2b to Fig. 2e.

Fig. 3 shows the layout of half a stave: six double-chip planar sensors cover the inner region of the stave, since they have shown excellent response for tracks orthogonal to the sensors surface, while four single-chip 3D modules populate each forward region, where they can ensure a better z-resolution for track reconstruction thanks to the orientation of their electrodes [11]. Consecu

The stack of the components between the bare stave and the module flex is shown: (a) stave end-block, cooling lines and stave flex, (b) thermal grease and glue dots, (c) FE-I4 front-end chips, (d) double-chip pixel silicon sensor, (e) module flex and SMDs. The stave flex wings are visible in Fig. (b-e).

by a 205 \(\upmu\)m gap. In order to minimize the services, groups of four FEs (i. e. groups of two double-chip modules or four single-chip modules) share the same high and low voltage powering lines, so that the stave is divided in eight powering groups: six double-chip powering groups and two single-chip powering groups. The voltage needed to deplete the sensors increases with radiation damage: for long term operation planar sensors will need up to 1000 V, while 3D sensors will not require more than 500 V. In order to avoid electric short between different powering groups, thin Kapton layers have been placed transversally as HV insulators in between each one.

## 3 Bare stave and stave flex quality check

The bare stave and stave flex quality check verifies the mechanical and electrical integrity of the stave once the flex is glued on the stave top laminate.

### Optical inspection

The IBL bare staves with the stave flexes glued on the stave top laminate are optically inspected upon reception at the loading site. The optical inspection verifies that no damage occurred during the transportation from CERN, where the stave top laminate and stave flexes are glued and qualified. To guarantee the integrity of the staves over the loading process, an optical inspection is repeated after any intervention.

The bare stave is inspected for cracks and scratches that could lead to failures in the mechanical integrity or in the electrical insulation. Since the stave end-blocks are the references taken in the metrology measurements, they need to be free of any mechanical defect. The face-plate sealing is checked for openings, that may affect the electrical integrity, and glue excesses, which may affect the planarity.

### Metrology survey

The metrology survey is performed to check that the maximum excursion between any two points on the face-plate surface is less than 350 \(\upmu\)m; this value is set by the mechanical envelope of the IBL structure. A Mitutoyo EURO C 9106 metrology machine has been employed for this tests, using a 0.997 mm wide probe. In the metrology survey, the head of the probe approached the face-plate with an angle of 75\({}^{\circ}\) in order to have a probing force of 2.5 \(g_{F}\)5 (compared to the 8 \(g_{F}\) applied at 0\({}^{\circ}\)). In each test, 99 points

Figure 3: Stave sensors layout (only half of a stave is shown). Six planar double-chip sensors are located in the inner part of the half-stave, while four 3D sensors cover the outermost region.

have been probed to sample the face-plate surface, being the planarity the minimum distance between two parallel planes containing the stave surface. The coordinate system origin was set on the stave end-blocks fixation in the handling frame. The arrangement of the 99 points and the orientation of the axes are shown in Fig. 4.

The metrology survey is performed twice for each bare stave: before and after the thermal cycling procedure (see Sec. 3.3).

### Thermal cycling

In order to reproduce the mechanical stress that the staves will face inside ATLAS and to identify stave infant mortality, the bare staves and stave flexes have been thermally cycled. At the beginning of this process, the staves are introduced in a climate chamber and the temperature is set to 35\({}^{\circ}\)C for one hour. Then the temperature is cycled from +40\({}^{\circ}\)C to -40\({}^{\circ}\)C for ten times with a ramp speed of 0.04 \({}^{\circ}\)C/s and it is kept stable for thirty minutes at each step. At the end of the procedure the chamber temperature is set at 20\({}^{\circ}\)C for three hours (Fig. 5). The humidity is constantly kept under control. Whenever possible, i. e. for temperatures between 5\({}^{\circ}\)C and 90\({}^{\circ}\)C, the humidity is set to 1%. Dry air with a dew point of -70\({}^{\circ}\)C is continuously flushed during operation from an upstream unit into the climate chamber.

After the thermal cycles, the face-plate metrology and a visual inspection are repeated. Measurements of the staves planarity before and after the thermal cycles are summarised in Tab. 2. Despite the larger values of the planarity after the thermal cycles, due to the different mechanical properties of the stave flexes and the bare staves, all the staves were fulfilling the planarity specifications (planarity \(<\) 350 \(\upmu\)m) before module loading.

## 4 Module reception tests

The module reception tests are devoted to ensure the functionality of the IBL modules after the shipment from the modules production sites to the loading site. The procedure consists of two steps: the optical inspection and the electrical qualification. Details of these two steps are given in Sec. 4.1 and Sec. 4.2 respectively.

Figure 4: Schematic view of the stave showing the metrology points location and reference axes. 99 probing points are organized in 3 lines spaced by 8.5 mm. The step size (or pitch) of the points in the same line is 20.75 mm.

### Optical inspection

The optical inspection is a thorough visual examination in which the modules are inspected by means of an optical microscope with a total magnification of up to 500\(\times\) and a Sony CCD/RGB DXC-151P camera. The purpose is to check the modules integrity after the transportation to the loading site. Particular attention is payed to damaged or disconnected wire-bonds. The visible part of the sensors is also inspected for cracks and any other damage that may affect the operation of the module. Systematical pictures have been taken during the optical inspection (see Fig. 6), with a particular care for:

* the fiducial marks, one on each corner of the sensor, since these are the references used during the metrology survey to know the position of a module with respect to the stave fixation reference;
* the HV pads, to make sure the pads are well glued and bondings are good, as a failure at this level could prevent the module to be operated.

### Electrical qualification

The electrical qualification of the IBL modules has been performed at the stave loading site by means of the USBpix setup [12], a modular system developed by the ATLAS Pixel Collaboration to test hybrid pixel detectors. An identical setup has been used at the module production sites for the module qualification tests. Pictures of the overall system are shown in Fig. 6(b).

Figure 6: Example of pictures taken during module optical inspection. These pictures show a FBK 3D module (namely F12-15-05).

#### 4.2.1 USBpix setup

A schematic view of the setup is given in Fig. 8. At hardware level it is composed of a Multi Input Output (Multi-IO) board which provides an USB interface driven by a micro-controller, an FPGA, a 2 MB onboard memory and a connector for the external trigger. A burn-in adapter card is is used to connect up to four modules. The full setup is also composed of: a PC, a TTi CPX200 DUAL 35 V 10 A PSU Low Voltage power supply operating at 2.5 V and a Keithley 2410 1100 V SourceMeter High Voltage power supply (see Fig. 6(a)). The FE LV powering is controlled via LV regulators in the burn-in adapter card and then sent to the FE-I4s via the module adapter cards (see Fig. 6(b)). LEMO cables have been used to connect the HV power supply to the module adapter cards. The electrical communication between the FE-I4s and the USBpix setup happens through an LVDS connection over an Ethernet cable. A climate chamber has been used in order to keep the temperature and the humidity at constant values during the tests.

Figure 8: Schematic representation of the USBpix setup.

Figure 7: The USBpix setup used for the electrical qualification of the modules. Fig. 6(a) shows the USBpix setup for single (left) and double (right) chip modules. Fig. 6(b) shows the USBpix adapter cards used for the electrical qualification of the modules.

The USBpix software is composed of two layers: STcontrol, the high level GUI layer, which controls the data analysis and the scans, and the USBpixdll library, which manages the communication with the hardware. The STcontrol software allows to set the parameters for the scans and it provides the possibility to define lists of tests to be run in sequence. All digital functionalities are implemented directly on the FPGA in order to reduce communications with the PC and, therefore, the processing time. Parallel testing of multiple modules is not implemented, therefore the modules are tested sequentially. A double USBpix setup is used to test double-chip modules since a single setup can handle one FE-I4 at a time due to limitations of the FPGA. At software level, this duality is hidden and tests can be run in parallel for two FEs.

#### 4.2.2 Electrical and functional tests

The electrical and functional tests performed during the module reception tests are described below.

I-V scanThe measurement of the leakage current as a function of the reverse bias voltage of a sensor allows the detection of possible mechanical damages and micro-cracks or sensor mis-behaving. Measurements have been performed with voltage values ranging from to 0 V to -350 V at steps of 5 V for planar sensors and from 0 V to -100 V at steps of 2 V for 3D sensors. A compliance value on the current at -20 A has been set for safety.

Digital testThe digital test consists in injecting pulses at the output of the discriminator of the FE [9]. In this way the digital part of the electronics is tested without being affected by the analog part.

Analog testThe analogue test is similar to the digital test, with the difference that the injections happen at the preamplifier input level. A voltage pulse, \(\mathrm{V_{cal}}\), is injected in the calibration capacitance, \(\mathrm{C_{inj}}\), of each pixel, generating a signal at the input of the preamplifier equivalent to the one generated by a charge \(\mathrm{V_{cal}}\)\(\mathrm{\cdot}\)\(\mathrm{C_{inj}}\). The combined information from the analog and the digital tests indicate if failures are present in the analog part of the circuitry.

Threshold scanThe main goal of the threshold scan is to measure the threshold and the Equivalent Noise Charge (ENC or noise) for each pixel. A certain number of pulses is generated for each different value of the injected charge, spanning over a range going from no hits detected to full efficiency. The number of collected hits versus the injected charge is then fitted with an S-curve function. The threshold is defined as the 50% detection probability while the noise is inversely proportional to the steepness of the curve in the transition region.

One important feature of the threshold scan is the possibility to identify the presence of disconnected bumps. This can be achieved by comparing, for each individual pixel, the noise measured in the scans with and without HV applied to the sensor. In case of no difference between the two noise measurements, there is a high chance for the pixel to be disconnected since the fact that the sensor is not fully depleted will not affect a pixel that is no lo longer connected to the sensor. Due to their higher capacitance the effects of disconnected bumps are much more visible in the case of planar sensor rather than for the 3D ones.

Crosstalk scanIn the crosstalk scan, the charge is injected in two neighbor pixels of the pixel under test, while the readout is enabled only for the last one. Measurable crosstalk indicates excessive coupling, which can be caused e.g. by shorted bumps.

### Reception tests results

A total of 455 modules was received and tested for stave production. The number of the modules loaded on the staves, the ones used for reworking and the ones that were not chosen for the loading is shown in Fig. 9.

Fig. 10b shows the distribution of the measured breakdown voltage values, V\({}_{\text{bd}}\), for the complete IBL module population received at the loading site. The minimum V\({}_{\text{bd}}\) observed for the planar sensors is 130 V and 95% of them have values greater than 200 V. For what concerns the 3D sensors, the sensors from the two producers present different performances: the breakdown distribution of the FBK production has a mean value of 42.5 V and a root mean square value of 7 V, while the CNM sensors present a flat distribution between 20 V and 105 V. The measurement of the I-V curve using the guard ring as ground contact adopted by CNM at wafer level did not allow to properly extrapolate the breakdown voltage value at the tile level as was done in the FBK case, where the measurement was performed on the full device. 14 CNM sensors presented a linear (ohmic) increase of current as a function of the increasing bias voltage in the explored range: in these cases the breakdown is most probably larger than the maximum voltage (100 V). No significant discrepancies have been found with respect to the production sites in terms of operational currents and breakdown voltages. In the very few cases where a lower V\({}_{\text{bd}}\) value was observed, the modules have been rejected. Less then 10 modules have been rejected due to communication issues with the front-end electronics. Whenever a problem in communication between the USBPix read-out system and the module occurred, a further check with the Reconfigurable Cluster Element (RCE) read-out system was performed. If the communication problem was confirmed, the module was disqualified.

Figure 9: Total number of modules tested (planar, 3D CNM and 3D FBK) organized in categories.

The modules loaded on the staves have been chosen after a careful selection that took into account, first of all, the ranking of the modules (assigned at the production site) and secondarily the V\({}_{\text{bd}}\), in order to group sensors with similar breakdown voltages in the same stave HV powering group (Sec. 5).

## 5 Module loading onto stave

The stave module loading procedure is described in this section, including the standard loading procedure (Sec. 5.1), module replacement (Sec. 5.3) as well as module replacement (Sec. 5.2).

### Module loading procedure

The first step in the loading procedure is the selection of the 12 planar and the 8 3D sensor modules to be loaded on one stave out of the ones available in stock at that moment. Due to the HV modularity, modules with similar breakdown performance were chosen for the same HV powering group. Moreover FBK and CNM 3D modules have not been mixed in the same HV group. The strategy adopted has been to choose the best modules available for the more central positions, both for planar and 3D modules.

At first the stave was positioned and aligned on the loading tool (Fig. 11), which provides support and the reference points for the loading procedure, protecting the stave top laminate as well as the stave flex. The stave handling frame provides the reference alignment of the stave with respect to the loading tools. A fine adjustment in the positioning of the stave handling frame with respect to the loading tool was performed by precisely aligning the stave face-plate edge to the loading tool reference points.

Once the stave alignment is performed, a 70 \(\upmu\)m thick stainless steel mask is positioned on the stave face

the \(x\)-axis and on the \(y\)-axis for the central module, as shown in Fig. 12d. Two Araldite 20118 glue drops per front-end chip are then applied with a needle on the thermal grease template openings to later fix the modules on their position. The first module is then loaded and pushed against the stoppers while a 205 um thick spacer is placed as shown in Fig. 12e with a holder block. This spacer sets the module-to-module distance, allowing a later insertion of an electric insulator, but also prevents any tilt angle of the module. The same procedure is then repeated for all the modules in the same half of the stave. Thanks to an extra positioning tool, equipped with plastic stoppers, a precise alignment is ensured as shown in Fig. 12f.

Footnote 8: Due to the tool design, the loading is done one side at a time, without any preference between A or C side. This side-to-side sequential loading is mainly due to the needed alignment tools in the central region that will overlap in the case of a parallel loading (see Fig. 12d for an example).

Weights of 20 g are positioned on top of the modules, one for each front-end readout chip9, during the glue curing process (24 hours at room temperature), helping the module to properly settle on the grease layer and the glue dots contacts (Fig. 12g). The weight and positioning tools are then removed (Fig. 12h) and an optical inspection is performed for each front-end electronic chip thanks to a built-in sliding camera (Fig. 12i).

Footnote 9: In order to prevent any damage to the module the weight is equipped with three Teflon feets in order to leave space for the wire-bonds and the loaded SMDs

The full process is then repeated on the other side of the stave.

Figure 11: 3D model of a stave and its handling frame positioned on the loading tool.

### Stave flex wing gluing and wire-bonding

Once all the modules are glued on the stave, the electrical connection between the stave flex services and the modules can start. This consists of several steps which are listed below. A layer of Araldite 2011 is deposited in correspondence of the stave flex wings (Fig. 12(b) and Fig. 12(c)) through a mask (Fig. 12(a)). This mask guarantees to spray the glue on the module flex only in desired area. The wings are then released and positioned on their approximate location (Fig. 12(d)) before installing the wing positioning tool (Fig. 12(e)). This tool locks the stave in its position by means of a wedge which pushes against the stave top laminate, allowing the wings to stay in their nominal position by using two clamps (Fig. 12(f)). All the wings are retracted and bent away to leave access to spray the glue. A weight of 16 g is then positioned on top of the wing during the glue curing process (Fig. 12(g)). In order to avoid any gluing or damage to the module nor to the wing pads, the weight contact surface is covered with Teflon.

Once the stave is fully loaded and cured, a Kapton insulator of \(\sim\)100 \(\upmu\)m is inserted in between each powering group for HV electrical insulation purposes (Fig. 12(h)). In order to avoid any glue between the modules, a holder (represented in white in Fig. 12(h)) is glued to two consecutive module flexes which holds the insulator. As a last step, the stave envelope is checked to fulfil the mechanical constrains of the IBL, as shown on Fig. 12(i)

Modules HV, clock, command, data output lines and powering pads are wire-bonded to the respective

wing pads with 25 \(\upmu\)m AlSi (1%) wires. For redundancy, four wire-bonds are performed per Low Voltage Differential Signaling (LVDS) and HV pad. Ten wire-bonds are dedicated to the LV and the ground to cope with the expected 0.5 A current per FE. For the wire-bonding operation, the stave and its handling frame are installed into the wire-bonding cradle. To ensure a good support and stiffness of the wire-bonded region, a shim block is positioned underneath the stave top laminate (Fig. 14). The bond-loop height was limited to a maximum value of 250 \(\upmu\)m. Wire-bonds quality was tested by pull tests, performed every 2 FE on empty pads. The results of the pull tests are reported in Tab. 3.

Half-way through the stave production, degradation of the wire-bond quality was observed due to corrosion phenomena. The activation of this corrosion was identified to be correlated to the humidity level during the thermal cycle procedure. Stave temperature and humidity were monitored during a thermal cycle (Fig. 15) showing that the dew point was reached during the fast temperature ramp-up due to the large volume of the climate chamber (1.6 m\({}^{3}\)). Thermal cycle on loaded staves was thus given up starting from stave 13. For the first twelve staves assembled, a dedicate re-bonding procedure was performed at the CERN Detector Silicon Facility (DSF) laboratory to recover all affected modules. All module flex to stave flex wire-bonds have been systematically redone after a proper pad cleaning. Front-end to module flex wire-bonds were redone case by case after a careful evaluation, due to the mechanical fragility of the front-end pads leaning out of the stave. The integrity (mechanical structure and electrical integrity) of thermal cycled staves was confirmed by metrology measurements and electrical characterisations.

### Module replacement procedure

A module replacement procedure has been developed, during the stave production period, in order to replace any failing module that was already loaded on a stave. In total, fifteen reworks have been performed due to modules being accidentally damaged during the module loading procedure, thus compromising the integrity of the sensor, the front-end or the module flex; five modules have been replaced due to failures of

the FE-I4 chip and two more modules have been replaced because they have failed the Quality Assurance tests performed in the CERN ATLAS clean rooms before final integration. In addition, due to the cleaning and re-bonding intervention performed at DSF, six more module were replaced on the twelve re-bonded staves. The statistics of the module replacements are shown in Fig. 16.

The module replacement procedure10 starts with the installation of two 100 \(\upmu\)m thick Kapton spacers between the module that needs to be removed and its neighbors (Fig. 17a). Spacers of only 100 \(\upmu\)m are placed during the module rework instead of 205 \(\upmu\)m in order to add some margin to the module placement. The spacers maintain the distances between the modules and protect the neighboring modules. The failing module is then removed by inserting a plastic spatula in between the module and the face-plate, breaking

the glue drop bonds (Fig. 16(b)). The face-plate is then cleaned to remove any thermal grease and glue. A new thermal grease layer is then applied by using an individual mask (Fig. 16(c)). Once the mask is removed, glue drops are applied (Fig. 16(d)) and the new module can be placed thanks to a dedicate individual positioning tool (Fig. 16(e)). A weight of 20 g for the 3D modules or 40 g for the planar modules is then put on top (Fig. 16(f)) during the glue curing process.

After the module placement, the wing gluing, the optical inspection, the envelope check and the HV insulator insertion are performed following the same procedure as for the standard loading.

## 6 Stave quality check

### Metrology survey

After a stave has been fully dressed, the position of the modules is checked by means of a metrology machine. The stave handling frame is positioned on the granite table of the machine and the stave cover is removed. A pattern recognition of the sensors fiducial marks (see Fig. 6) is performed and the \(x\), \(y\) and \(z\) coordinates are obtained using a probe, as shown in Fig. 18. The results on the staves \(z\)-axis profiles are shown in Fig. 19, divided between \(\phi^{+}\), the side where the modules stick out with respect to the stave profile, and \(\phi^{-}\), the side where the wings are.

Fig. 20 shows the distributions of the modules residuals with respect to the nominal \((x,y)\) positions. Results indicate a positioning precision of \(\sim\)50 \(\upmu\)m for planar modules in both axes and \(\sim\)34 \(\upmu\)m in \(x\) and \(\sim\)57 \(\upmu\)m in \(y\) for 3D modules.

### Electrical and functionality quality check

The purpose of these quality check is to verify the electrical and functional integrity of the stave components after having been loaded, in particular to check any possible damage that may have occurred during one of the assembly, wire-bonding or metrology survey steps. For the reworked staves, additional tests have been performed in order to monitor the staves behavior after each intervention.

The electrical quality check procedure consists in the same kind of tests carried out during the module reception-tests (see Subsec. 4.2.2) with the addition of noise and ToT scans and a dedicated tuning procedure. The description of the setup and of the scans follows.

#### 6.2.1 Setup

A scheme of the stave testing setup is given in Fig. 21.

For the stave cooling, a system using CO\({}_{2}\) similar to the one that will be used for IBL in ATLAS is adopted: the TRACI (Transportable Refrigeration Apparatus for CO2 Investigation), a multipurpose cooling system for R&D. TRACI is able to cool the staves between -35\({}^{\circ}\)C and 20\({}^{\circ}\)C, providing a maximum cooling power of about 250 W.

A custom Detector Control System (DCS) has been developed for the monitoring of temperature and humidity. This DCS is based on a National Instrument board, instrumented with humidity and temperature sensors, and Labview software. An interlock has been set to prevent modules to reach temperatures above 40\({}^{\circ}\)C.

The powering of the stave requires Low Voltage (LV) and High Voltage (HV) supplies: the first ones are meant for the FE readout chips while the second ones are for the depletion of the silicon sensors. Four LV power supplies have been used to take care of the powering of the FEs. Each power supply had two powering channels, thus making possible the simultaneous operation of the eight LV channels needed

for a stave. A Low Voltage regulator system has been developed to ensure that the LV regulation does not accidentally exceed the limit of 2.4 V, in order to operate the readout electronics in a safe mode. An ISEG\({}^{\text{\text{\text{\text{ii}}}}}\) crate has been used for the HV power of the silicon sensors. This HV power supply is able to reach up to -1000 V, while the scans are limited down to -350 V. A dedicated Labview program has been developed for monitoring and for interlock purposes. The software cuts off the HV of a channel if the current gets higher than 100 \(\upmu\)A.

The DAQ setup is made of two RCEs and two High Speed Input/Output (HSIO) boards which communicate through optical fibers. In particular, the RCE uses the Advanced Telecommunications Computing Architecture (ATCA) standard. RCE has been used to run the scans and to decode and collect the data, while the HSIO took care of converting and transmitting the signals.

#### 6.2.2 Electrical quality check procedure

The basic electrical functionalities of the staves were verified by checking the power-up, the voltages set, the current consumption (both in non-configured and in configured FE states) and I-V curves of the sensors.

The power-up procedure was initiated after the staves had been cooled to 19\({}^{\circ}\)C. FEs were powered with 2.4 V and then configured. The increase of the temperature and of the current consumption were systematically recorded after each operation.

Figure 21: Sketch of the stave testing setup.

ToT testThe charge collected by the readout electronics from the sensor is translated in the time interval that the signal stays above the threshold (Time over Threshold, ToT12) by the discriminator of the FE [9]. This information is therefore used by the readout system to measure the collected charge in the pixel sensors. In order to check the quality of the calibration, a dedicated ToT test has been developed, which consists in injecting a given charge in the FE and measure which is the equivalent ToT. In the stave quality check, 16000 e\({}^{-}\) are injected in order to measure the ToT behaviour.

TuningThe target of the tuning is to set the threshold of the FE discriminator at 3000 e\({}^{-}\) and to get a corresponding value of 9 ToT for an injected charge of 16000 e\({}^{-}\). In Fig. 21(a) the mean threshold for each FE of the stave 2 is shown. A 3000 e\({}^{-}\) threshold has been set and subsequently measured over the 32 FEs. The threshold distribution for a FE has a sigma value of about 35 e\({}^{-}\) after the tuning procedure.

ResultsThe I-V performances of the modules after the loading are consistent with those measured during the module reception tests. For any stave, the HV output is shared among different sensors due to the stave flex design, so the only sensor breakdown observable is the lowest in the sector. The distribution of the voltage breakdown at the stave level is shown in Fig. 22(c). In Fig. 22(b), the Equivalent Noise Charge, ENC, and threshold distributions of the modules after tuning are shown. In this conditions the ENC mean value for planar sensors is about 130 e\({}^{-}\) for the normal pixels, while for 3D sensors the mean noise value is slightly higher: it is 160 e\({}^{-}\) for FBK sensors and 145 e\({}^{-}\) for CNM sensors. The higher noise value of the 3D modules with respect to the planar ones is due to the larger coupling pixel capacitance given by the design of the 3D sensors themselves. The noise value has not been affected by the loading procedure and it is consistent with the measurement made at the reception tests and in the module assembly laboratories.

## 7 Conclusions

The IBL stave loading activities have been successfully completed after one year of intensive work (see Fig. 24). Twenty production staves and three prototypes have been assembled in the laboratories of the stave loading site. Several custom tools and jigs have been designed and produced to load the modules onto the staves. A rework procedure was developed and successfully performed, allowing the substitution of any failing module. Two test stands have been built to qualify the modules and the staves, operating in a temperature and humidity controlled environment.

For the production of the IBL staves, 456 silicon modules have been tested, showing excellent performances as in the production sites. 428 of these have been loaded onto the 20 staves produced. A total of 15 of the loaded modules have been replaced due to mechanical accidents which compromised their integrity, 6 modules have been replaced after cleaning at DSF, 5 because of front-end failures and 2 because of failed QA. These numbers are understandable given the important R&D size of the whole IBL project. The module loading procedure did not affect the performance of modules, nor changed the sensor breakdown, nor increased the number of bad pixels

The collected results have been used as a reference for the IBL stave quality assurance tests performed at CERN before the IBL loading [13].

IBL is now in the core of the ATLAS detector and it is undergoing commissioning and operation phases.
