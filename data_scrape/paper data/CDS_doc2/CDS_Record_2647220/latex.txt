Prospect studies for the production of three massive vector bosons with the ATLAS detector at the High-Luminosity LHC

The ATLAS Collaboration

This document presents prospects for the expected ATLAS sensitivity to the production of three massive vector bosons \(W^{\pm}W^{\pm}W^{\mp}\), \(W^{\pm}W^{\mp}Z\) and \(W^{\pm}ZZ\) at \(\sqrt{s}\) = 14 TeV at the High-Luminosity Large Hadron Collider with 3000 fb\({}^{-1}\) and 4000 fb\({}^{-1}\). Final states with two same-sign, three, four or five leptons (electrons or muons) are considered. The results are presented in terms of expected signal significance and the estimated precision on the signal strength measurement.

## 1 Introduction

Measurements of the multi-boson production at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) provide an excellent test of the electroweak sector of the Standard Model (SM). The triple gauge couplings (TGCs) and quartic gauge couplings (QGCs) that describe the strengths of the triple and quartic gauge boson self-interactions are completely determined by the non-Abelian nature of the electroweak SU(2)\({}_{\rm L}\times\) U(1)\({}_{\rm Y}\) gauge structure in the SM. These interactions contribute directly to diboson and triboson production at colliders. Studies of triboson production can test these interactions and any possible observed deviation from the theoretical prediction would provide hints of new physics at a high energy scale. Triboson production also represent a source of irreducible background in many searches for physics beyond the SM (BSM).

The production of multiple heavy gauge bosons \(V\) (\(=W^{\pm},Z\)) opens up a multitude of potential decay channels categorised according to the number of leptons and jets in the final state. Only charged leptons (electrons and muons) are considered in the studies. In this document we focus on the production of \(W^{\pm}W^{\mp}\), \(W^{\pm}W^{\mp}Z\) or \(W^{\pm}ZZ\) where at most one boson decays hadronically: \(W^{\pm}W^{\pm}W^{\mp}\rightarrow\ell^{\pm}\nu\ell^{\pm}\nu\ell^{\mp}\nu\), \(W^{\pm}W^{\pm}W^{\mp}\rightarrow\ell^{\pm}\nu\ell^{\pm}\nu jj\), \(W^{\pm}W^{\mp}Z\rightarrow\ell^{\pm}\nu\ell^{\mp}\nu\ell^{+}\ell^{-}\), \(W^{\pm}ZZ\rightarrow\ell^{\pm}\nu\ell^{+}\ell^{-}\ell^{+}\ell^{-}\), \(W^{\pm}ZZ\rightarrow\ell^{\pm}\nu\ell^{+}\ell^{-}\ell^{+}\ell^{-}\), \(W^{\pm}ZZ\rightarrow\ell^{\pm}\nu\ell^{+}\ell^{-}\nu\nu\), \(W^{\pm}ZZ\rightarrowjj\ell^{+}\ell^{-}\ell^{+}\ell^{-}\) and \(W^{\pm}ZZ\rightarrow\ell^{\pm}\nu\ell^{+}\ell^{-}jj\), with \(\ell=e\) or \(\mu\). The \(ZZZ\) channel is not included in these studies due to its very small cross-section. The leading order (LO) Feynman diagrams for the processes of interest are shown in Figure 1. Prospect studies have been performed, using a cut-based analysis, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 3000 fb\({}^{-1}\) and 4000 fb\({}^{-1}\) of proton-proton collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of \(\sqrt{s}\) = 14 TeV, expected to be collected by the ATLAS detector at the the High-Luminosity Large Hadron Collider (HL-LHC) [1, 2].

## 2 The HL-LHC and the ATLAS detector

In the Run-2 data-taking period, the ATLAS detector collected \(\sim\) 140 fb\({}^{-1}\) of proton-proton collisions with a peak instantaneous luminosity of \(2\times 10^{34}\) cm\({}^{-2}\)s\({}^{-1}\) and an average number of collisions per bunch crossing of \(\langle\mu\rangle\sim 35\). A second long shutdown (LS2) will follow, after which the Run-3 will start. The data collected up to the next long shutdown (LS3) will amount to \(\sim\) 300 fb\({}^{-1}\) with an increase of the centre-of-mass energy to the designed value of 14 TeV. During LS3, the accelerator is foreseen to be upgraded to achieve instantaneous luminosities of 5-7\(\times 10^{34}\) cm\({}^{-2}\)s\({}^{-1}\) after which the HL-LHC phase will start. At the HL-LHC the average number of pile-up interactions per bunch crossing is expected to reach 200 and the data collected will amount to \(\sim\) 3000 fb\({}^{-1}\).

The ATLAS detector [3] is a multi-purpose particle detector with a cylindrical geometry.1 It consists of layers of inner tracking detectors surrounded by a superconducting solenoid, calorimeters, and a muon

spectrometer, and will need several upgrades to cope with the expected higher luminosity at the HL-LHC and its associated high pileup and intense radiation environment. The primary motivation for the upgrade design studies is to maximise the potential of the experiment for searches and measurements despite these harsh conditions. A new inner tracking system (ITk) [4], extending the tracking region up to \(|\eta|\leq 4\), will provide the ability to reconstruct forward charged particle tracks, which can be matched to calorimeter clusters for forward electron reconstruction, or associated to forward jets. A new detector, the high granularity timing detector (HGTD) [5], designed to mitigate the pile-up, is also foreseen. The other planned upgrades to the ATLAS detector are described in detail in Ref. [6].

Cylindrical coordinates (\(r,\phi\)) are used in the transverse plane, \(\phi\) being the azimuthal angle around the \(z\)-axis. The pseudorapidity \(\eta\) is defined in terms of the polar angle \(\theta\) by \(\eta=-\ln\tan(\theta/2)\).

## 3 Simulation samples

Monte Carlo (MC) simulated event samples are used to predict the background from SM processes and to model the multi-boson signal production. Simulation samples were generated at 14 TeV \(pp\) centre-of-mass energy, with a number of events equivalent to at least 3000 fb\({}^{-1}\) integrated luminosity.

For the generation of triboson signal events, matrix elements for all combinations of \(pp\to VVV\) have been generated using Sherpa v2.2.2 [7] with up to two additional partons in the final state, including next-to-leading-order calculations (NLO) in QCD [8; 9; 10] accuracy for the inclusive process, as described in Ref. [11]. All diagrams with three electroweak bosons are taken into account, including diagrams involving Higgs propagators, as in Figure 1. However, since these samples use factorised decays with on-shell vector bosons, the resonant contribution from those diagrams can not be reached from the 125 GeV Higgs boson. In order to account for the contribution coming from these diagrams, the corresponding production of \(VH\) bosons is added to the signal. Electroweak NLO corrections to the signal production are not considered in this analysis. The diboson processes are generated with the Sherpa event generator following the approach described in Ref. [11]. For the simulation of the top-quark pair and the production of \(VH\) bosons Powheg[12; 13; 14] + Pythia[15] was used as described in Ref. [16], while for \(t\bar{t}\) + \(V\) and \(t\bar{t}\) + \(H\), MadGraph5_aMC@NLO [17] interfaced to Pythia was used as in Ref. [18]. The top quark pair-production contribution is normalised to approximate NNLO+NNLL accuracy [19; 20].

## 4 Object and event selection

The generated events are overlaid with additional inelastic \(pp\) collisions per bunch-crossing which are simulated with Pythia. Parameterisations of the expected performance of the ATLAS detector during the HL-LHC runs have been derived with dedicated studies based on the simulation of the ATLAS detector using the Geant4 program [21]. These parameterisations can be found in Ref. [22].

Lepton trigger and identification efficiencies are derived as a function of \(\eta\) and \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) and used to estimate the likelihood of a given lepton to fulfil either the trigger or identification requirement, respectively. The muon transverse momentum and the electron energy resolutions are also parameterised as a function of \(\eta\) and either the transverse momentum (for muons) or transverse energy (for electrons).

Final-state particles with lifetime greater than 10 ps are clustered into jets (denoted as particle-level jets) using the anti-\(k_{t}\) jet clustering algorithm [23] with a radius parameter of 0.4. Final-state muons and neutrinos are not included in the truth jet clustering. To avoid double-counting of jets associated with electrons, an overlap requirement is applied to exclude jets within a cone of \(\Delta R(e,j)<0.2\) to any electron with transverse energy greater than 7 GeV. To account for detector effects, the truth jet momentum is smeared as a function of \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) and \(\eta\). To identify jets originating from the fragmentation of a \(b\)-quark (\(b\)-jets), an algorithm which has an efficiency of 70% was used. The corresponding rejection factor for jets originating from the fragmentation of a \(c\) (light) quark is about 20 (750) [4].

The contribution of jets misidentified as electrons is derived as a function of \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) and \(\eta\).

The missing transverse momentum, \(\mbox{$E$}_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\), with magnitude \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\), is defined at particle level as the transverse component of the vectorial sum of the momenta of non-interacting particles in the event. The \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\) resolution is parameterised as a function of the overall event activity.

The experimental signature of the triboson processes considered in this analysis consists of at least three charged leptons (or two leptons with the same electric charge in the case of the \(W^{\pm}W^{\pm}W^{\mp}\) channel, where one \(W\) boson decays hadronically), moderate \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\) originating from the leptonic decay of \(W\) bosons or neutrino decay of \(Z\) bosons, and jets in case one of the vector bosons decays hadronically. Events are preselected by either a single-muon or single-electron trigger. The forward tracking is considered, allowing to select electron candidates up to \(|\eta|\leq 4\) and muon candidates up to \(|\eta|\leq 2.7\). In order to suppress contributions from the background processes and to increase the signal acceptance, the preselected electron or muon candidates are required to fulfil either _tight_ or _loose_ identification criteria described in Ref. [22]: for the \(WWW\) channel two same-sign _tight_ or three _tight_ leptons are required, for the \(WWZ\) two _tight_ and one or two _loose_ leptons, and for the \(WZZ\) channel three, four or five _loose_ leptons are required. Jets with \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>\)30 GeV and \(|\eta|<4.5\) are considered for the analysis if not stated otherwise.

The event selection criteria are based upon the one used in the ATLAS \(W^{\pm}W^{\pm}W^{\mp}\) analysis at 8 TeV centre-of-mass energy, published in Ref. [24], but considers tighter selection criteria on the transverse momentum of the selected objets and missing transverse momentum of the event, in order to suppress higher pile-up contributions expected at the HL-LHC. Several kinematic variables have been considered in order to suppress events with non-prompt leptons and off-shell vector boson decays. The final selection requirements used to define the signal regions described in the following are obtained from an optimization to maximize the sensitivity to the \(W^{\pm}W^{\pm}W^{\mp}\), \(W^{\pm}W^{\mp}Z\) and \(W^{\pm}ZZ\) processes and to reduce the contributions from SM background. In the case of the \(W^{\pm}W^{\pm}W^{\mp}\to\ell^{\pm}\nu\ell^{\pm}\nu\ell^{\mp}\nu\) channel, three separate signal regions are defined based on the number of same-flavour opposite-sign (SFOS) lepton pairs in the event: 0SFOS (\(e^{\pm}e^{\pm}\mu^{\mp}\), \(\mu^{\pm}\mu^{\pm}e^{\mp}\)), 1SFOS (\(e^{\pm}e^{\mp}\mu^{\pm}\), \(e^{\pm}e^{\pm}\mu^{\mp}\), \(\mu^{\pm}\mu^{\mp}e^{\pm}\), \(\mu^{\pm}\mu^{\mp}e^{\mp}\)) and 2SFOS (\(e^{\pm}e^{\pm}e^{\mp}\), \(\mu^{\pm}\mu^{\pm}\mu^{\mp}\)). Similarly, in the \(W^{\pm}W^{\mp}Z\to\ell^{\pm}\nu\ell^{\pm}\nu\ell^{+}\ell^{-}\) channel, two signal regions are defined based on the selection of SFOS or different-flavour opposite-sign (DFOS) lepton pairs events: SFOS (\(e^{\pm}e^{\mp}\mu^{\mp}\mu^{\pm}\), \(e^{\pm}e^{\mp}e^{\pm}e^{\mp}\), \(\mu^{\mp}\mu^{\pm}\mu^{\mp}\mu^{\pm}\)) and DFOS (\(e^{\pm}e^{\mp}\mu^{\mp}e^{\pm}\), \(\mu^{\mp}\mu^{\pm}\mu^{\mp}e^{\pm}\)). To select \(W^{\pm}W^{\pm}\to\ell^{\pm}\nu\ell^{\pm}\nu jj\) candidates, events are required to have exactly two leptons with the same electric charge, and at least two jets. Three different final states are considered based on the lepton flavour, namely \(e^{\pm}e^{\pm}\), \(e^{\pm}\mu^{\pm}\) and \(\mu^{\pm}\mu^{\pm}\). In the case of the \(W^{\pm}ZZ\) process, a separate set of selection criteria is defined, depending on the decay of the bosons. In all channels, events are rejected if they have identified \(b\)-jets. This selection requirement suppresses background with top quarks, and it has a marginal impact on the signal efficiency. Tables 1 to 6 show the kinematic selection criteria used for the channels considered in this analysis.

## 5 Results

The SM processes that mimic the multi-boson signal signatures by producing at least three prompt leptons or two prompt leptons with the same electric charge, can be grouped into the following categories:

* The \(WZ\) and \(ZZ\) processes, referred to as "diboson background";
* The \(WWW,WWZ,WZZ,ZZZ\) processes, excluding the signal process under study, referred to as "triboson background";
* The \(VH\) and \(t\bar{t}H\) processes, excluding the processes which are added to the signal, referred to as "Higgs+X background";
* The production of four top quarks, top quark associated with \(WZ\) bosons or \(t\bar{t}\) associated with \(W\), \(Z\), \(WZ\) or \(W^{\pm}W^{\mp}\) bosons, referred to as "top background";
* Processes that have non-prompt leptons (electrons) originating from misidentified jets (referred to as "fake-lepton background");
* Processes that produce prompt charged leptons, but the charge of one lepton is misidentified (referred to as "charge-flip background").

The contributions from the \(WW\) and \(t\bar{t}\) processes are accounted for in the fake-lepton and charge-flip backgrounds. The diboson, triboson, Higgs+X and top background sources are estimated using simulated events, with the dominant irreducible background in most of the channels originating from the diboson processes. In some channels the contribution of the fake-lepton background, which is derived by applying the pre-defined (\(p_{\mathrm{T}}\), \(\eta\))-dependent likelihood as described in Section 4, becomes significant. The charge-flip background has been investigated and found to be negligible in all considered processes.

Regarding the \(WWW\to 3\ell\)\(3\nu\) channel, one can observe that the 0SFOS signal region has the best signal-to-background ratio due to the requirement that suppresses \(Z\) boson decays. Background is dominated by the diboson irreducible background and the fake-lepton contribution. The fake-lepton contribution mainly arises from \(t\bar{t}\to\ell\ell\)+jets events, with a jet misidentified as an electron. The contribution of signal events containing Higgs decays is at the level of 40%, and consistent between the three signal regions. In the \(WWW\to 2\ell\)\(2\nu\)\(2j\) channel, the signal-to-background ratio is worse than in the leptonic one, with the dominant background from the \(WZ\) diboson process. The total number of signal and background events expected after the full event selection in each channel, for an integrated luminosity of 3000 fb\({}^{-1}\) is shown in Table 7. Figure 2 shows the transverse mass distributions of the trilepton system, \(m_{\mathrm{T}}^{3\ell}\), for the \(WWW\to 3\ell\)\(3\nu\) channel after summing over the three signal regions and separately for 0SFOS events, and the distribution of the sum of the scalar \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) for all selected objects, \(\Sigma p_{\mathrm{T}}=p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\ell_{1}}+p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\ell_{2}}+p_{ \mathrm{T}}^{f_{1}}+p_{\mathrm{T}}^{f_{2}}+E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\) for the \(WWW\to 2\ell\)\(2\nu\)\(2j\) channel.

In the \(WWZ\) process the largest signal-to-background ratio is obtained in the four lepton channel, with two leptons being of different flavour, as this requirement suppresses a large fraction of the diboson background. The contribution of Higgs+X is smaller with respect to the \(WWW\to 3\ell\)\(3\nu\) case due to the invariant mass requirement \(m_{\ell\ell}^{\mathrm{DFOS}}>40\) GeV. A very large fraction of the background arises from the production of top quarks in association with \(Z\) and \(W\) bosons. The selection requirement on high \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\) has been checked and found to show no discrimination power between signal and background. The \(WWZ\to 3\ell 1\nu 2j\) channel is dominated by the irreducible diboson background. The total number of signal and background events expected after the full event selection in each channel, for an integrated luminosity of 3000 fb\({}^{-1}\) is shown in Table 8.

Similarly, in the \(WZZ\) channel the signal region with the largest signal-to-background ratio is the one with five charged leptons. In this case, the fake-lepton contribution becomes significant. The background is dominated by rare top production of \(t\bar{t}WZ\). The other channels suffer from low signal-to-background ratio. The total number of signal and background events expected after the full event selection in each channel, for an integrated luminosity of 3000 fb\({}^{-1}\) is shown in Table 9. Figure 4 shows the distributions of the two-lepton invariant mass \(m_{\ell\ell}\), selected to give the mass closest to the mass of the \(Z\) boson, and of the \(W\) boson decay lepton \(p_{\rm T}\) for the \(WZZ\to 5\ell 1\nu\), as expected from the signal and background processes at 3000 fb\({}^{-1}\) after applying the selection criteria from Table 5.

Systematic uncertainties in the signal and background predictions arise from the uncertainties in the measurement of the integrated luminosity, from the experimental modelling of the signal acceptance and detection efficiency, and from the background normalisation. With the much larger integrated luminosity and a sophisticated understanding of the detector performance and backgrounds at the HL-LHC, we expect experimental uncertainties related to the lepton reconstruction and identification efficiencies as well as lepton energy/momentum resolution and scale modelling of 1%, to the \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\) modelling of 1%, to the jet energy scale and resolution of 1.5% and 5% in the fully leptonic and leptons+jets channels, respectively, to the luminosity measurement of 1% and to the expected pileup of 1% [22]. Based on the extrapolations of current ATLAS measurements and assuming a reduction of the uncertainty at the level of 15-80%, depending on the process and the origin of the systematics, the following systematic uncertainties on the cross-section normalisation for each of the background processes are assumed: 4% on \(\sigma_{\mathrm{diboson}}\), 30% on \(\sigma_{\tau\mathrm{riboson}}\), 3% on \(\sigma_{t\bar{t}}\), 20% on \(\sigma_{t\bar{t}H}\), 6% on \(\sigma_{t\bar{t}Z}\), and 11% on \(\sigma_{t\bar{t}W}\). The uncertainty on the level of the fake-lepton background is estimated to be 10%. Taking these assumptions into account, we estimate the total systematic uncertainty on the background of 9%, 6% and 5% for the 0SFOS, 1SFOS and 2SFOS categories, respectively, in the \(WWW\to 3\ell\)\(3\nu\) channel, 8% for all categories in the \(WWW\to 2\ell\)\(2\nu\)\(2j\) channel, 6% in the \(WWZ\to 4\ell\)\(2\nu\) channel, 8% in the \(WWZ\to 3\ell\)\(3\nu 2j\) channel, 9% in the \(WZZ\to 5\ell 1\nu\) channel, 5% in the \(WZZ\to 3\ell 3\nu\) channel and 7% in the \(WZZ\to 4\ell 2j\) and \(WZZ\to 3\ell 1\nu 2j\) channels.

Assuming that the number of signal events follows a Poisson distribution and taking into account an estimated total systematic uncertainty on the background (\(\sigma_{B}\)) explained above, the signal significance \(Z_{\sigma}\) is calculated from the number of estimated signal and background events, indicated by \(N_{\mathrm{sig}}\) and \(N_{\mathrm{bkg}}\), respectively [25]:

\[Z_{\sigma}=\sqrt{2\bigg{[}\Big{(}N_{\mathrm{sig}}+N_{\mathrm{bkg}}\Big{)} \mathrm{log}\frac{N_{\mathrm{sig}}+N_{\mathrm{bkg}}}{B_{0}}+B_{0}-N_{\mathrm{ sig}}-N_{\mathrm{bkg}}\bigg{]}+\frac{\Big{(}N_{\mathrm{bkg}}-B_{0}\Big{)}^{2}}{ \sigma_{B}^{2}}}, \tag{1}\]

where \(B_{0}=\frac{1}{2}\bigg{(}N_{\mathrm{bkg}}-\sigma_{B}^{2}+\sqrt{\Big{(}N_{ \mathrm{bkg}}-\sigma_{B}^{2}\Big{)}^{2}+4\Big{(}N_{\mathrm{sig}}+N_{\mathrm{ bkg}}\Big{)}\sigma_{B}^{2}}\ \bigg{)}\).

The estimated precision on the signal strength measurement, \(\frac{\Delta\mu}{\mu}\), is calculated as

\[\frac{\Delta\mu}{\mu}=\frac{\sqrt{N_{\mathrm{sig}}+N_{\mathrm{bkg}}+\sum_{i=0 }^{\mathrm{b}}\Big{(}N_{i}\sigma_{i}\Big{)}^{2}+\sum_{j=0}^{\mathrm{s}}\Big{(} N_{j}\sigma_{j}\Big{)}^{2}}}{N_{\mathrm{sig}}}, \tag{2}\]

where the SM backgrounds originating from the diboson, triboson, \(t\bar{t}\), \(t\bar{t}H\), \(t\bar{t}W\), \(t\bar{t}Z\) and fake-lepton are taken into account separately in the summation, assuming the systematic uncertainties on the cross-section normalisation listed above. Only experimental uncertainties are taken into account separately for the \(VVV\) and \(VH\) signal events. Uncertainties related to the limited number of simulated events are neglected. The expected signal significance is calculated separately for every channel and shown in Table 10. The expected precision on the signal strength measurement is calculated for integrated luminosities of 3000 fb\({}^{-1}\) and 4000 fb\({}^{-1}\) only for channels with \(Z_{\sigma}>3\), assuming the same values for the systematic uncertainties in both cases. The results are shown in Table 11.

The HL-LHC offers a large improvement to multi-boson production, as demonstrated by this simple cut-based analysis. Sensitivities larger than \(3\sigma\) are expected in two channels and larger than \(5\sigma\) in one channel. It should be noted that more mature analysis techniques such as MVA, would likely improve these results further. However, it is expected that precise estimations of the main backgrounds, i.e. from dibosons and fake-leptons, will be needed in HL-LHC data analysis, in order to obtain a high level of precision.

## 6 Conclusion

Prospect studies of the searches for the production of three vector bosons, \(W^{\pm}W^{\pm}W^{\mp}\), \(W^{\pm}W^{\mp}Z\) or \(W^{\pm}ZZ\), in fully leptonic and channels with jets are reported. Results correspond to an integrated luminosity of 3000 fb\({}^{-1}\) and 4000 fb\({}^{-1}\), expected to be collected at a centre-of-mass energy of 14 TeV by the ATLAS detector during the HL-LHC run. Signal regions have been defined for every channel separately, based on the selection requirements optimized to maximize the sensitivity to the \(W^{\pm}W^{\pm}W^{\mp}\), \(W^{\pm}W^{\mp}Z\) and \(W^{\pm}ZZ\) processes and to reduce the contributions from SM background processes. Results in terms of the expected signal and background yields, the significance and the the signal strength measurement are given. Three channels, \(W^{\pm}W^{\pm}W^{\mp}\to 3\ell\ 3\nu\) and \(W^{\pm}W^{\mp}Z\to 4\ell\ 2\nu\) and \(W^{\pm}ZZ\to 5\ell\ 1\nu\), are expected to provide sensitivities larger than \(3\sigma\) with the precisions of the corresponding cross section measurements of 11%, 27% and 36%, respectively, at 3000 fb\({}^{-1}\).

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{l|c} \hline Channel & \(Z_{\sigma}\) at 3000 fb\({}^{-1}\) (4000 fb\({}^{-1}\)) \\ \hline \hline \(WWW\to 3\ell\ 3\nu\) & 0SFOS: 6.7 (7.0) \\  & 1SFOS: 1.0 (1.0) \\  & 2SFOS: 0.7 (0.7) \\ \hline \(WWW\to 2\ell\ 2\nu\ 2j\) & \(e^{\pm}e^{\pm}\): 0.8 (0.8) \\  & \(e^{\pm}\mu^{\pm}\): 1.2 (1.2) \\  & \(\mu^{\pm}\mu^{\pm}\): 1.8 (1.8) \\ \hline \(WWZ\to 4\ell\ 2\nu\) & SFOS: 0.1 (0.1) \\  & DFOS: 3.0 (3.1) \\ \(WWZ\to 3\ell\ 3\nu 2j\) & 0.3 (0.3) \\ \hline \(WZZ\to 5\ell 1\nu\) & 3.0 (3.4) \\ \(WZZ\to 4\ell 2j\) & 0.1 (0.1) \\ \(WZZ\to 3\ell 3\nu\) & 0.03 (0.03) \\ \(WZZ\to 3\ell 1\nu 2j\) & 0.04 (0.04) \\ \hline \end{tabular}
