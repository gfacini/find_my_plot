**Talk at the VII International Conference on Calorimerny in HEP on behalf of the ATLAS/Tile Calorimeter Collaboration**

Monitoring and intercalibration of the ATLAS TileCal is based on a hydraulically driven gamma sourcesystem. Extensive R&D has been carried out and has led to a detailed design for the full ATLAS TileCal. A prototype system has been built and tested on the Barrel and Extended Barrel modules. The realisation of the Cs source system, results concerning its performance, comparisons with other calibration information and checks of the optics quality of the detector obtained with the Cs source are presented.

## 1 The Tile Cal Calibration

The ATLAS [1] Barrel hadronic calorimeter is an iron-scintillating tiles sampling calorimeter with the novel characteristic of the tiles being oriented parallel to the incident particles direction into the calorimeter and staggered in depth to provide projectivity. The principle, the construction and beam tests of this calorimeter as well as its optics system have been described in detail in previous talks (see [2] and refs therein) and publications [3]. The light produced in the scintillating tiles is transported by WLS fibres to the PMTs where it is converted to charge and treated by the electronics. Each tile is read by two fibres along its two sides leading to two photomultipliers (PMTs) for reasons of increased light yield and redundancy (double readout).

The systems that are used for the intercalibration and monitoring of TileCal are meant to cover the signal path from the scintillators to the electronics. The tools used are:

1. The movable radioactive source system that "sees" the optics and the PMTs and is read by its own electronics.
2. The laser which "sees"the PMT and the standard readout electronics part.
3. The charge injection system for the readout electronics.

This talk concentrates on the \({}^{137}Cs\) system which is movable, so it excites light in all scintillators with the same mechanism as particles from the LHC interaction. The response to the \({}^{137}Cs\) source is the product of the calorimeter response and the response of the PMT. Thus this system is ideal for:

* intercalibration of the readout cells by adjusting the HV of the corresponding PMT,
* monitoring of the calorimeter response in time which is a means of maintaining the energy scale, and
* checking the quality of the optical response and its uniformity.

Concerning the requirements for the performance of the system in ATLAS, a precision of 1% is useful for the response monitoring for reasons of early detection of any degradation. For the cells intercalibration a weaker than 1% precision is needed, driven by the fact that a 5% cell miscalibration would add 1.5% quadratically to the constant term of the energy resolution for pions and less than 1% for jets.

## 2 The Hydraulic System and its Performance

The concept of the movable source calibration scheme is shown in figure 1(left). In the way the system is realised for module0, a 8 mCi \({}^{137}Cs\) source excites sequentially the scintillators of a readout cell by running along tubes which pass perpendicularly through holes in the tiles. Anode currents of \(\approx\)40 mA for \(10^{5}\) PMT gain were observed and since the \({}^{137}Cs\)\(\gamma\)-rays induce single photoelectrons signals, typical equivalent currents of \(4\times 10^{6}\) photoelectrons/sec

are to be read. Using a JFET-input operational amplifier with a few msec integrating time constant, the signal is converted to voltage with a negligible ripple. The source induced current is measured about every 3 mm, giving 6 points per tile.

A typical picture of the source passage through 5 cells of the calorimeter is shown in figure 1(right). The 5 structures correspond to the 5 readout cells and the little wiggles in each of them are the individual tiles of each cell. The average response of a cell is calculated as the integral under the curve after subtracting the baseline. By dividing by the cell width one obtains a response which is normalised for the cell size and can directly be used for the readout cell response equalisation (by adjusting accordingly the HV of the PMTs).

The requirements for such a system in the ATLAS framework is that it should be remotely contoled, operated with minimal access and manipulated without risk of radiation exposure. Apart from that it should be relatively fast doing a full calorimeter scan in \(\approx\)8 hours (along \(\approx\)9 km of tubes). A lot of prototyping has been done during the last few years [5] leading to the adoption of a hydraulically movable system as the appropriate for ATLAS [4].

The concept of the hydraulic system is as follows: The tubes in which the source moves are filled with a liquid which is set in motion with a pump. The source, contained in a capsule with a dumb-bell shape, is let to flow in the liquid. For capsule diameter smaller but close to the inner diameter of the tube, the velocity of the capsule is the same with the velocity of the liquid in motion.

A hydraulic system was realised and installed on both the Barrel and Extended Barrel modules 0 that were tested in 1996 and 1997 respectively. The source tube layout for the Extended Barrel module0 with the 12 tubes passing through the 11 rows of tiles is shown in figure 2(left). The two ends of the tube circuit are connected to the pump. The need to have a safe method of the source position location led to the installation of emitter/sensor pairs at the tube joints which also allowed the measurement of the capsule velocity. The source was remotely operated from the control room. The aluminium dumb-bell shaped capsule was shown by extensive tests to be optimal for reliable transport in bent sections of the tubes.

The hydraulic system was heavily used over the last two years performing daily scans and other systematics tests via which the operation performance of the system was studied. The speed of the capsule proved to behave linearly with respect to to the rotation speed of the pump. The speed variation from run-to-run was better than a few %. The variation of the speed from tube-to-tube within a run was less that 1% over a wide velocity range 1. Thismeets the requirement of speed control capability to the 1% level, in order not to compromise the precision of measuring the source induced current. The operation of the system was easy and robust.

## 3 Performance of Calibration

The level of intercalibration after the high-voltage adjustment was for both Barrel(46 PMTs) and Extended Barrel modules 0 (2x28 PMTs) 1% (rms dispersion). This is very impressive given that the intrinsic error of the cell response measurement with the \({}^{137}Cs\) data is 0.7%. During the 1996 test of the Barrel module 0 the stability of the calorimeter was followed during 40 days. The rms variation seen by the PMTs varied from 0.4% to 1.3% during that period, which is compatible with expectations from the repeatability of the measurement.

The movable source system allows us to check the optics quality of the calorimeter by performing an X-ray as it scans the calorimeter. If there is a fibre-to-tile coupling problem for instance, a picture like the one in figure 1(right) should appear, seen by only one PMT of the two linked to that tile. Other problems in fibers, fibre bunches or tiles can be spotted due to the double readout of cells and to the fact that the source "sees" all the optics elements.

Each of the three longitudinal sampling of the TileCal consists of many tile rows (3-6-2 in the barrel and 3-4-4 in the extended barrel). With the source the uniformity inside each sampling can be checked. This is depicted in

figure 2(right), where the relative light yield of each row of the Barrel module 0 is shown. Each sampling is rather uniform and in the case of tiles 6-8 the uniformity can be improved by adjusting the fibre lenghts attached to them, thus improving the homogeneity.

It is always useful to check the results of a certain method with other means. As mentioned above, the Cs and the laser overlap in the PMT part and data by both are taken in parallel such as to spot problems, if any. A test was performed to check if this is possible. The HV of a group of 10 PMTs was set to their nominal HV and 3 other values. In figure 3(left) we see the laser and Cs responses as the HV changes. The 4 groups of points correspond to the 4 HV values. The correlation between the two measurements is seen by the straight line and the dispersion around the line is only 0.6 %.

Other attempts were also made to correlate with particles data. Muons at the test beam hitting the calorimeter perpendicularly to the tiles surface are a very good sample. We see a first indication that the responses to Cs and muons agree in fig.2(right), where the uniformity is checked by both. Apart from that, the response of individual cells to muons impinging at 90 \({}^{o}\) and to Cs are directly compared, showing a correlation at the level of 5%. This will be improved with more precise calibration of the electronics in the low energy region.

Finally the fact that the module was intercalibrated to the 1% level was checked with 180 GeV pions hitting the calorimeter projectively over its face scanning 20 cells and giving substantial energy to all of them. The asymmetry

in the signal measured by the two PMTs (L and R) attached to a cell is shown in fig.3(right) for all the cells. Since the rms is 1.6%, the calibration of an individual PMT is good to \(1.6/\sqrt{2}\)=1.1%, giving an independent check of this figure of merit.

## 4 Conclusions

A novel hydraulically driven source system has been built and extensively tested on the modules 0 with the real ATLAS size and operation specifications. The system operation and the calibration performances are very satisfactory for the ATLAS requirements. Cell intercalibration of 1% was achieved and cross checks with other calibration information agrees to 1%-few %. The ongoing work concerns the finalisation of the ATLAS design and the long-term stability tests of the module 0.
