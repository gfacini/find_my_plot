**Measuring \(WZ\) longitudinal polarization with the ATLAS detector**

The ATLAS Collaboration

The prospects are presented for measuring, in ATLAS, the spin density element, \(\rho_{00}\), of the \(Z\) and \(W\) bosons in \(WZ\) production. The analysis considers events where both \(W\) and \(Z\) decay leptonically via electron or muon channels. This is done by reconstructing the decay angle of the leptons in the \(Z\) and \(W\) rest frames. The fraction of longitudinally polarized \(Z\)'s and \(W\)'s are extracted from the angular distributions. The errors presented correspond to an integrated luminosity of 100 fb\({}^{-1}\). The expected final error on the measurement includes the systematic error due to detector correction and also due to the choice of proton parton distribution function.

Introduction

The production of \(WZ\) events is of interest since it is precisely predicted in the Standard Model (SM) through the interaction of quarks. These predictions concern not only the total cross section but also the polarization of the \(Z\)'s and \(W\)'s produced and their dependence on the centre of mass energy. The \(WZ\) process was first observed at the Tevatron[1] but could not be studied in detail due to poor statistics. In the LHC there is a unique opportunity to observe and study this process in much more detail and in particular to investigate the longitudinal polarization of the \(Z\) and \(W\). The longitudinal polarization is of special interest since it can not be observed in single \(Z\) or single \(W\) production where there is only transverse polarization, whereas in di-boson processes there is also longitudinal polarization. Data and MC comparison of the \(WZ\) polarization states will be important for ensuring that this interaction is well understood in the SM.

The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the theoretical framework. In section 3 event generation and software are discussed. Section 4 presents the event selection and the proposed measurement technique. The systematic uncertainties are discussed in section 5 and the results are presented in section 6.

## 2 Theoretical Framework

The differential cross section for transversely and longitudinally polarized \(Z\) and \(W\) production can be given in terms of Spin Density Matrix (SDM) elements. For the \(W\) it is given by,

\[\frac{d\sigma_{L}}{d\cos\theta_{W}}=\rho_{00}(\hat{s},\cos\theta_{W})\cdot \frac{d\sigma}{d\cos\theta_{W}}, \tag{1}\]

\[\frac{d\sigma_{T}}{d\cos\theta_{W}}=(\rho_{++}(\hat{s},\cos\theta_{W})+\rho_{-- }(\hat{s},\cos\theta_{W}))\cdot\frac{d\sigma}{d\cos\theta_{W}}, \tag{2}\]

where \(\rho_{++}\), \(\rho_{--}\), \(\rho_{00}\) are the diagonal elements of the SDM, \(\theta_{W}\) is the \(W\) production angle as defined in figure 1 and \(\sqrt{\hat{s}}\) is the \(q\overline{q}\) reduced centre of mass energy. The diagonal elements satisfy the condition: \(\sum\rho_{\tau\tau}=1\). It is possible to extract these diagonal elements from the differential distribution of the charged lepton in the rest frame of the decaying \(W\). Assuming a \(W\) of spin one decaying into two spin half leptons, the expected angular distribution for massless leptons in the rest frame of the parent \(W\) is given in terms of the diagonal elements of the SDM[2] by,

\[\frac{1}{\sigma}\frac{d\sigma}{d\cos\theta_{l}}=\rho_{--}\frac{3}{8}(1+\cos \theta_{l}^{*})^{2}+\rho_{++}\frac{3}{8}(1-\cos\theta_{l}^{*})^{2}+\rho_{00} \frac{3}{4}\sin^{2}\theta_{l}^{*}. \tag{3}\]

where \(\theta_{l}^{*}\) is the decay angle of the negatively charged lepton (positively charged anti-lepton) produced in the decay of the \(W^{-}\) (\(W^{+}\)), as seen in the \(W\) rest frame, with respect to the \(W\) direction in the \(WZ\) centre of mass frame. This angle, \(\theta_{l}^{*}\) is shown in figure 1.

In the case of the \(Z\) boson[3,4] the angular distribution of the leptons in the \(Z\) rest frame is given by:

\[\frac{1}{\sigma}\frac{d\sigma}{d\cos\theta_{l}}=\rho_{--}\frac{3}{8}(1+\cos \theta_{l}^{*2}+2\cdot A\cdot\cos\theta_{l}^{*})+\rho_{++}\frac{3}{8}(1+\cos \theta_{l}^{*2}-2\cdot A\cdot\cos\theta_{l}^{*})+\rho_{00}\frac{3}{4}\sin^{2} \theta_{l}^{*}. \tag{4}\]

where \(A=\frac{2\cdot v\cdot a}{v^{2}+a^{2}}\) in terms of v and a the vector and axial vector couplings of the Z to leptons and \(\theta_{l}^{*}\) is the decay angle of the negatively charged lepton in the \(Z\) rest frame with respect to the \(Z\) direction in the \(WZ\) centre of mass frame. This angle \(\theta_{l}^{*}\), is also shown in figure 1.

MC Data Samples

Samples of simulated data events of \(q\overline{q}\) producing \(WZ\)'s in the final state were generated using the MC@NLO[5] MC generator. CTEQ6M[6] parton distributions functions were used for this and other generators.

In order to evaluate the contribution of possible background sources MC samples for \(t\overline{t}\), \(W^{+}W^{-}\), \(ZZ\) and \(Z\)+jet events were also produced using MC@NLO. \(Z\)+photon events were produced by PYTHIA[7]. The generated MC samples were processed by the full ATLAS simulation program and then reconstructed as for real data.

## 4 Measurement of the Spin States of the \(Z\) and \(W\) Bosons

### Event selection

The process \(WZ\rightarrow\ell\nu\ell^{+}\ell^{-}\), \(\ell=e,\mu\), can potentially have some dangerous backgrounds. The main distinguishing feature of this process is three isolated leptons. The background sources considered are \(t\overline{t}\), \(W^{+}W^{-}\), \(ZZ\), \(Z\)+jet and \(Z\)+photon events, all of which can contain three real or fake leptons in the final state. To enhance signal and suppress background we apply the following cuts:

* A minimum angle of \(20^{\circ}\) is required between the leptons and any jet so that the leptons are isolated.
* The leptons must have \(p_{T}\) over 25 GeV and rapidity below 2.5 (motivated by the detector acceptance[8]). These two cuts make sure that the event is well contained in the detector with full trigger efficiency.
* The next cut is the requirement that the missing transverse momentum in the events should be more than 25 GeV. This requirement takes account of the missing energy caused by the undetected momentum of the neutrino in the event.
* The invariant mass of the two leptons associated with the \(Z\) is required to be within 12 GeV of the \(Z\) mass.
* The next cut is the requirement that there should at most one jet in the events, and the transverse momentum of that jet must be below 30 GeV. This cut minimizes background from multi-jet events.
* Similarly to the cut on the invariant mass of the Z candidate, one would like to cut on the invariant mass of the \(W\). However, the \(W\) cannot be reconstructed, as the longitudinal component of the invisible neutrino cannot be measured. We use instead the \(W\) transverse mass, \(M_{T}^{W}\) which is composed from the reconstructed transverse momenta of the charged lepton, \(p_{T}^{l}\), and the neutrino \(p_{T}^{\rm miss}\), \[M_{T}^{W}=\sqrt{(p_{T}^{l}+p_{T}^{\rm miss})^{2}-(\overline{p_{T}^{l}}+ \overline{p_{T}^{\rm miss}})^{2}}.\] (5) The requirement here was to accept events with transverse mass between 50 and 90 GeV and was optimized to reject non-\(WZ\) events.
* The angle in the transverse plane between the missing transverse momentum and the nearest lepton is required to be larger than \(40^{\circ}\). This cut rejects non-\(WZ\) events since in a real \(WZ\) event the neutrino direction (represented by the missing energy) and the direction of each of the leptons is not expected to overlap.

The full list of cuts applied are presented in table 1. The expected number of events passing each selection stage are presented in table 2. One can see that after all the cuts the level of background to \(WZ\) events is around a 1%. This is considered negligible.

The reconstruction of the leptons is described in Refs [9, 10] and the jets in Ref. [11].

### Measurement technique

The values of the different SDM elements, \(\rho_{\tau\tau}\), depend on the true \(\hat{s}\) and on the production angle of the \(Z\) or \(W\). In a \(q\overline{q}\) interaction from proton-proton collisions, the value of true \(\hat{s}\) varies over a significant range. Therefore, there is a unique opportunity to study the dependence of the different \(\rho_{\tau\tau}\) on true \(\hat{s}\). According to the Standard Model, the dependence of the \(\rho_{\tau\tau}\) on the \(Z\) and \(W\) production angle is expected to be quite weak and therefore was not studied in this analysis.

The events were divided into 3 bins in true \(\sqrt{\hat{s}}\) such that there is a variation in the theoretical value for \(\rho_{00}\) and adequate statistics in each bin according to the MC. The \(Z\), \(W^{-}\) and \(W^{+}\) decay angle distribution changes considerably between the energy bins. This is illustrated in figure 2 for \(Z\) and \(W^{-}\) obtained from generated \(W^{-}Z\) events before detector and selection effects. The variation in the shape of the distribution between the various true \(\sqrt{\hat{s}}\) bins reflects the different polarization in each of these bins.

For real data there will be an experimental difficulty in reconstructing the lepton decay angle in the rest frame of the \(Z\) or \(W\). This is due to the inability to measure the longitudinal momentum of the neutrino, \(p_{z}^{\nu}\) and therefore to fully reconstruct the event. However, constraining the invariant mass of the lepton and neutrino system to the \(W\) mass, yields a quadratic equation with two solutions for \(p_{z}^{\nu}\), leading to two different reconstructions for each event. For each reconstruction, we calculate the corresponding cross section contribution, using the formalism of Ref. [12]. This allows us to construct a weight for each solution. The weighted average of the two \(p_{z}^{\nu}\) values is then used for the final reconstruction of that event. This technique gives an estimate of the decay angles and \(\sqrt{\hat{s}}\). The quality of this estimate is

shown in figure 3 where the difference between the true and reconstructed \(\sqrt{\hat{s}}\) is shown, and also in figure 4 where the difference between the true and reconstructed \(W^{-}\) decay angle is shown. The differences are centered at zero showing that there is no bias in this technique. The width of the distribution is a measure of the quality of the technique. We consider the resolution of this technique to be reasonable. The systematic uncertainties on our measurement from the use of this technique will be discussed in the next subsection. The main motivation for this technique is the reconstruction of the decay angle for the \(W^{-}\) and \(W^{+}\). However this technique is also needed in the case of the \(Z\) since we do not know the boost of the system and therefore we can not correctly reconstruct the decay angle.

The polarization is measured by the means of an un-binned fit of equations [3] and [4] to the decay angle distribution. The values of the \(\rho^{++}\) and \(\rho^{--}\) can also be determind in the fit but are not the focus of the present study. The reconstructed uncorrected distributions of the decay angles for the \(Z\), \(W^{-}\) and \(W^{+}\) are shown in figure 5. According to MC the distribution of the \(Z\) coming from \(W^{-}Z\) and the \(Z\) coming from the \(W^{+}Z\) are very similar and therefore only distributions for the \(Z\) from \(W^{-}Z\) events are shown.

### Detector correction

The aim of this study is to measure the true value of \(\rho_{\tau\tau}\) and compare it to the SM value. Therefore, we must correct for the imperfect reconstruction of the decay angle due to the undetected neutrino decay. Another cause of imperfect reconstruction of the decay angles is due to detector effects. Finally, the \(p_{T}\) and rapidity cuts summarized in table 1, will reject some of the relatively low true \(\sqrt{\hat{s}}\) events in the original sample and this will have an effect on the measured value of \(\rho\). This effect must also be corrected.

In order to determine the correction factor, the angular distribution of the leptons in the rest frame of the \(Z\) and \(W\) were compared before and after the simulation of detector effects. The detector correction (\(d_{cor}\)) for angular bin \(i\) is given by \(d_{\rm cor}^{i}=\frac{N_{\rm gen}^{i}}{N_{\rm meas}^{i}}\). where \(N_{\rm gen}^{i}\) and \(N_{\rm meas}^{i}\) are the number of events in bin \(i\) before and after the detector simulation. This procedure was done in each of the \(\sqrt{\hat{s}_{\rm reco}}\) bins separately. The values of the detector correction for each of the energy bins are shown in tables 3-5 for the \(Z\), \(W^{-}\) and \(W^{+}\) cases. The corrections for \(Z\) coming from \(W^{-}Z\) and \(Z\) coming from \(W^{+}Z\) are consistent and therefore the same corrections were applied for both. For some bins, the statistics were too low to determine the correction factor and these bins are not used in the fit.

## 5 Systematics

In this analysis the MC is used to correct the \(\cos\theta_{l}^{*}\) distribution of the decaying lepton in the \(Z\) and \(W\) rest frames for the effects of the angular reconstruction (in the case of the \(W\)'s) and the cuts made for signal selection. It is necessary to consider systematic uncertainties on these corrections. The uncertainties considered are MC statistics, the choice of the proton parton distribution function(PDF) and the sensitivity to the event weight used in the reconstruction of the decay angle. The error on the MC statistics was computed by considering the statistical error in each angular bin before and after the detector simulation and selection cuts.

The uncertainties due to the proton PDF were evaluated by calculating the correction factor for each of 40 eigenvector PDF sets corresponding to the CTEQ6M central set. The CTEQ6M Parton distribution function was accessed using the LHAPDF[13] interface. Each of the 40 PDF sets was used to extract a new value for \(\rho_{00}\) and the systematic error was obtained from the width of the \(\rho_{00}\) distribution.

The event weight, calculated for each of the two reconstructed solutions for neutrino, was changed to include possible non-SM couplings. The amount of variation in the couplings was taken from the Tevatron limits[14].

Table 6 summarizes the systematic uncertainties on the polarization.

## 6 Results and Conclusions

Table 7 shows the fraction of longitudinally polarized \(W\)'s and \(Z\)'s bosons measured for each \(\sqrt{\hat{s}_{\rm reco}}\) bin using simulated data of 100 fb\({}^{-1}\). The values have been corrected for the detector effects as described in section 4.3. For comparison the true MC values are shown. The errors on the simulated data indicate the expected sensitivity of the measurement. In this analysis the measurements and the true MC values should agree since the correction factors are taken from MC. These results are shown in figure 6. Since according to MC the results for \(Z\) coming from \(W^{-}Z\) are consistent with the results for \(Z\) coming from \(W^{+}Z\) only the result for \(Z\) coming from \(W^{-}Z\) are shown.

In conclusion, it was shown that it would be possible to measure the SDM element \(\rho_{00}\) with luminosity of a 100 fb\({}^{-1}\) in \(WZ\) events. This may be done in bins of \(\sqrt{\hat{s}_{\rm reco}}\) which will be interesting for a detailed study of this process.
