LEAD THICKNESS CONTROL SYSTEM FOR THE ATLAS END CAP PRODUCTION

Gaston Garcia Lopez, Luis Hervas Leon

Universidad Autonoma de Madrid Introduction

The ATLAS detector, as explained in the Technical Proposal, must attain a high resolution performance if projected research programs are to be successfully carried out at the LHC.

Electromagnetic calorimetry is one of the critical points upon studying crucial processes like

\[H\rightarrow\gamma\gamma\]

To achieve the required energy resolution the absorber plates of the calorimeter must fulfill very strict thickness requirements. Therefore it is a mandatory part of the end cap production and assembly to have a precise thickness control system for lead plates and to guarantee that such plates are manipulated properly troughout the whole process. The first of these two aspects is considered in depth in this paper.

## 2 Description of the thickness control system

Thickness will be controlled by laying plates on a precision table and measuring on a grid of \(5cm\) pitch (\(570\) points).

Measurements are performed with an ultrasonic device supplied by Krautkramer-Branson 1. It consists of a probe, readout electronics and a computer interface module.

Footnote 1: Reference CL 304, with a data interface module DI 304 and a special delay probe; it operates sending wavetrains lasting a fraction of a microsecond each (with frequency about 20 MHz) at a rate of 196 Hz to 25 kHz ( automatically selected according to range)

The probe must be placed on the surface of the plate. The presence of a liquid layer between lead and probe is required in order to ensure an approximate matching of the mechanical impedances and, therefore, getting a correct measurement. A drop of water has proven to be adequate. The device sends an ultrasonic pulse and receives the waves reflected at the upper and lower surfaces, measuring the time delay. The speed of sound must be determined by other means and introduced manually, if one wants to obtain a thickness reading. This problem will be discussed later on.

The interface module allows to read the thickness displayed on the device screen with a computer. Data transfer is activated by a hand switch that has been replaced by a computer controlled one.

The probe must be taken to the point where the measurement has to be performed; then a drop of water must be laid at the correct place and the probe must be placed on the lead surface. Besides it is advisable to remove dust from the plate before laying the drop of water. This is all achieved with two engines, a compressed air circuit, and a set of four valves, all computer controlled. Part of this system was designed and built at LPNHE-PARIS.

In our case we use a Motorola VME processor talking through interfaces with the X-Y scan table and the ultrasonic module. The set of electronic valves and the switch for Krautkramer data transfer are controlled by an interface card connected on the VME bus, which provides TTL compatible signals through a set of connectors. These signals are then used to activate or close the valves and switch as required at each phase of the program.

## 3 Calibration studies.

### Statement of the problem.

In order to perform the absolute calibration of the ultrasonic measurement device, a Palmer micrometer has been used. The ultrasonic system gives precise measurements of the time the signal needs to travel between the upper and lower surfaces of the lead plate (actually it measures the difference in time of the signals reflected at the upper and lower interfaces). The probe has a finite area surface, so it somewhat averages thickness over a certain region of the plate. On the other hand, the micrometer will measure the distance between the outermost points, since the shaft will stop moving once it has found an obstacle.

These two observations lead to a very simple model. The two parameters that we would like to determine are the speed of sound (\(v\)) and the overestimation of thickness due to lead roughness (\(\epsilon\)). The thickness measured by the ultrasonic system is

\[z_{k}=v_{k}\,t\]

where \(v_{k}\) is the sound velocity arbitrarily given to the device (taken from a table of material properties, for example) and \(t\) the time measured.

If we now measure with the Palmer we get

\[z_{Pal}=vt+\epsilon\]where \(v\) is the exact speed of sound.

Subtracting and eliminating t

\[z_{Pal}-z_{k}=(v-v_{k})t+\epsilon=\left(\frac{v-v_{k}}{v_{k}}\right)z_{k}+\epsilon\]

Then we can easily calculate \(v\) and \(\epsilon\) by just measuring at different thicknesses with the Palmer and the ultrasonic probe, and adjusting the data to a straight line. From the slope we can extract \(v\), and this is likely to be a reliable result; the y axis intercept is \(\epsilon\), but it probably won't give any significant information unless we vary our measurements over a wide thickness range.

We will assume that \(\epsilon\) is not exactly a measure of rugosity, but of a certain number of effects that make Palmer and Krautkramer have a systematic offset from each other. We would expect that rugosity should give the main contribution to \(\epsilon\), but this could be erroneous for laminated plates, for example.

### Uncertainty on thickness measurements

Before going any further we need to determine the uncertainties in the readings we get from both the ultrasonic device and Palmer micrometer. To this end the thickness is measured at the same point and in the same conditions many times. It's not advisable to measure too many times at the same point with the Palmer in order not to deform the plate and end up with wrong data.

The results for the ultrasonic device are displayed on figure 1. The thirty measurements are performed at the same point. Between every two of them the automatized table moved to different points and made some other measurements, and between measurements number 10 and 11, and number 20 and 21, the device was turned off. The three sets of ten measurements didn't show any clustering around different values. Within the range of thickness explored (2-3 mm) no variation in this result has been found. We therefore give an absolute thickness resolution (assuming a perfect calibration) of

\[\Delta z_{k}=0.0007m\]

Nevertheless, it has also been detected that at points with surface defects a manifestly wrong reading can sometimes be obtained. We will deal with these "special" points later on.

The same procedure was followed with the Palmer micrometer, but now measuring only ten times, in order to prevent deformation of the plate at the point of interest, as explained above. Data are summarized on figure 2. The uncertainty is

\[\Delta z_{Pal}=0.0016mm\]

This kind of experiment has been repeated many times in different conditions with similar results.

### First results

To determine the parameters \(v\) and \(\epsilon\) and to check the assuptions made so far, we took a variable thickness plate (about 2.8 mm at the thicker end and 1.9 at the thinner one) and measured 21 points along the maximum slope direction. This plate had been machined with a rotating head, so we expected a rather large \(\epsilon\). On top of this, there are some surface irregularities that yield erroneous measurements with the ultrasonic device. Because of this last reason two of the 21 points had to be rejected. The fitting of the remaining 19 is plotted in figure 3. Error bars on \(z_{Pal}-z_{k}\) are assumed to be \(1.7\mu m\), the quadratic sum of resolutions from Palmer and ultrasonic probe given above. Error bars on \(z_{k}\) are taken as \(0.7\mu m\). \(v_{k}\) used on measurements was \(2.238Km/s\). After obvious computations we get from the fitting

\[v=2.213\pm 0.003Km/s\]

and

\[\epsilon=0.043\pm 0.003mm\]

with a chi-square per degree of freedom of 4.1 (19 points), not too good but acceptable. We will see later on that a possible explanation of this fact is related to the meaning of the \(\epsilon\) parameter. It is also worth mentioning that some points seem to show a systematic pattern (the rightmost ones on the plot). Palmer measurements began precisely with these points, so there may be a thermal relaxation effect.

A new experimental test was made, now having set the speed of sound to \(2.208Km/s\). This value, approximately equal to the one obtained in the previous fitting, was chosen in order to correct for the possible thermal stabilization effect of the Palmer (basically removing some points from the fitting). The idea of this second fitting is to check the conclusions and to see if the speed of sound is consistent with the one found previously.

An important fact has been ignored until now: the systematic offset between Palmer and ultrasonic measurements is not a constant, but rather a property of each small region of the plate that can be considered a random quantity and expected to have a gaussian distribution around a certain value (the \(\epsilon\) parameter). We will use the data of this second experiment to analyze this behaviour and to refine the obtained speed of sound.

This time we have 19 points. The same fitting done above is presented in figure 4 and gives now

\[v=2.214\pm 0.003Km/s\]

\[\epsilon=0.043\pm 0.003mm\]

The results confirm the initial value given for \(v\).

The distribution of thickness difference (corrected to the speed of sound given by these new data) is shown in figure 5. What we get is much like what we expected: the distribution has a width of around \(0.004mm\), so the mean value can be estimated with an uncertainty below \(0.001mm\) just measuring some 20 points, as we've been doing so far. On the other hand the distribution shows a good gaussian character.

### Data analysis

The previous measurements validate our model and determine the sound velocity and the roughness parameter. However, we would like to have the values of these two quantities for one of the constant thickness plates to be finally used in the assembly of module-0. The lead used has been produced at a different factory and thus we expect the sound velocity to change. Furthermore constant thickness plates are shaped through a laminating procedure which is expected to yield a very different roughness (much smaller, in principle) while other contributions might become relevant. If this calibration method is to be applied to thickness measurements on plates for module-0, we ought to repeat the process explained in the previous section with a constant thickness plate. This is different than with the variable thickness plates in the sense that the \(z_{k}\) variation range will be only of order \(0.02mm\)., comparable to the size of the error bars. However we have seen that fitting measurements to a straight line in the fashion explained above isolates effects due to irregularities on the lead surface and eliminates them from the problem of calibration. In order to estimate the speed of sound in constant thickness plates we will take advantage of the fact that we have plates of two types: 2.2 and 1.7\(mm\) thick.

### Data from constant thickness plates

Before displaying the data obtained some remarks must be made:

* Since \(\epsilon\) is the mean value of a quantity that varies from point to point, it will be necessary to measure several points on each type of plate, in order to average out and isolate information due to the speed of sound in the slope of the fitting.
* All the points taken on the same plate have essentially the same thickness. Therefore we only have two effective points, no matter how many measurements are made: one of them is at \(z_{k}\simeq 1.7mm\) and the other one at \(z_{k}\simeq 2.2mm\). Several measurements at each type of plate will give us a \(z_{Pal}-z_{k}\) distribution and an ordinate value of \(\overline{z_{Pal}-z_{k}}\) will be assigned to each of these points, with its error calculated in the usual way. The slope will then be derived applying the formula for the straight line that goes through two given points: \[\frac{v-v_{k}}{v_{k}}=\frac{\left(\overline{zPal-z_{k}}\right)_{2}-\left( \overline{zPal-z_{k}}\right)_{1}}{\left(z_{k}\right)_{2}-\left(z_{k}\right)_{ 1}}\] Error propagation can be done in the usual way. In order to be more precise, instead of exactly 2.2 and 1.7, we will use the average \(z_{k}\) of all points for each type of plate. It can be seen that error propagation gives negligible contributions from \(z_{k}\), so it can be neglected.

Four plates were used for calibration, two of each type. Twelve points were measured on each, with an initial \(v_{k}=2.253Km/s\). That gives 24 data points at each thickness, with the following results:

\[\left(z_{k}\right)_{1} =1.7335mm\quad\left(\overline{zPal-z_{k}}\right)_{1}=-0.0261\pm 0.0 005mm\] \[\left(z_{k}\right)_{2} =2.244mm\quad\left(\overline{zPal-z_{k}}\right)_{2}=-0.0314\pm 0.0 006mm\]

The \(zPal-z_{k}\) data at 2.2 and 1.7\(mm\) are shown in figure 6.

Finding the slope and solving for \(v\) gives then \[v=2.230\pm 0.004\,Km/s\]

As a curiosity we can point out that the average \(\epsilon\,\)parameter comes out to be

\[\overline{\epsilon}=-0.009\pm 0.003mm\]

It seems that rugosity is negligible and some other effect, like for example compression, makes the Palmer give a systematically lower reading than the ultrasonic system.

### Conclusion

The model used gives consistent results and now we have a precise calibration for all plate measurements. The speed of sound to be used will be

\[v=2.230\,Km/s\]

It must be pointed out that measurements leading to this number were performed at a temperature of \(18^{0}C\).

However, on every plate calibration will be checked comparing the two types of reading at one point. The Palmer should show an underestimation of about \(10\mu m\) with respect to the Krautkramer. Any noticeable deviation from this behaviour will warn us that one of the two devices is not working properly.

Since thickness readings are obtained measuring the time t with a very small intrinsic precision (below \(1\mu m\), as shown previously) and then calculating \(z=vt\), propagation of the error coming from \(v\) gives, for all measurements, a global offset from the exact value of

\[\Delta z\leq 4\mu m\]

which is fully acceptable.

Stability of the Krautkramer ultrasonic device

Once calibration has been fully discussed, that is, once we know that the readings we get are correct, it is necessary to check how these results depend on conditions of operation. Two effects will mainly be considered:

* How the thickness reading evolves through several hours of operation.
* How the thickness reading changes with temperature.

In the first case, if any variation occurs at all, it should show a more reliable performance as the device "warms up". The thickness versus temperature behaviour is expected to be linear (for small temperature changes) and slowly varying.

### Performance versus time of operation

The thickness control setup is planned to be working for eight to ten hours a day. Therefore it is important to check if the readings vary from the first minutes to, say, the last hour. To this end a variable thickness plate was thoroughly measured six times (over eight hours of operation) without stopping the system. Three measurements were taken at each point. The temperature was kept at 12 degrees Celsius along the whole process.

Two different checks were made with these data:

* A few points were selected at random and the thickness is plotted versus time of operation. For each point we have data taken at six different moments that we label 1,2,...,6.
* On the other hand we have three measurements per point taken during a few seconds. These numbers can be substracted one from the other in three different ways, and the difference should be close to zero in any case. Therefore, each time the plate is measured we have a total number of data equal to three times the number of points. The distribution of these differences around zero will give us valuable information about the resolution of the device. We would like to check that it doesn't appreciably vary after long operation.

The results are plotted in figures 7 and 8. In the former, sets of three measurements are plotted versus time of operation for four different points of the plate;in the latter the distribution of thickness differences explained above is displayed for the six successive runs. Note that on the sixth run the system was stopped before finishing the measurements so we have a smaller number of points.

Figure 7 manifestly shows that there is no drift along the time of operation.

Figure 8 shows that the same shape is repeated in the six runs: about eighty percent of the data are exactly zero and most of the remaining twenty percent is equally divided between \(1\mu m\) and \(-1\mu m\).

### Temperature dependence

A variable thickness plate was measured at three different temperatures and a few points were selected at random to see how thickness readings vary. The results are plotted on figure 9. The response of the ultrasonic device is rather linear. We have too few points to fit to a straight line, but we can see that the thickness reading is changing by \(0.5\mu m\) per degree. If this difference were exclusively due to lead dilatation it would give a coefficient of \(0.00018K^{-1}\). However the speed of sound is also expected to change with temperature. Both effects should be cumulative (that is, the speed of sound should decrease with temperature and therefore enhance the reading compared to true thickness). The variation measured is about six times greater than what would be expected if the speed of sound were not changing. Therefore it can be concluded that this effect is more important than bare dilatation. In fact it can be proven that, to a very good approximation, speed of sound and volume depend on temperature in the same way (of course, for small changes in T), that is, both effects are strictly proportional with a factor that our data suggest to be around six. It is not worthwhile to measure the speed of sound at different temperatures, since the expected variations are within the errors computed.

The conclusion of this section can be summarized as follows:

* The speed of sound must be evaluated on constant thickness plates at the same temperature to be maintained in the workshop during the measurement process. This temperature must be precisely controlled.
* Eventually, a small correction can be applied to measurements obtained at temperatures differing from \(18^{0}C\) more than, say \(2^{0}C\). It would be \[\left(\Delta z\right)_{T}=0.5\Delta T\] with \(z\) given in \(\mu m\) and \(T\) in degrees Celsius.

The so-called "bad points"

The ultrasonic probe that is being used must contact the lead surface in a paralel way. The mechanical system that brings the probe down leaves a small angle of freedom so that it can adapt to the plate surface. When there is a bump or some other sharp imperfection, the Krautkramer device will not be fully reliable anymore.

These "bad points" can be classified into two types:

* (I) Sometimes the superficial defect is not too sharp and several readings at the same point give correct thickness values, but with a distribution width larger than at normal points (typically, \(10\mu m\) instead of \(1\mu m\)).
* (II) Other points exist where you may even notice the imperfection visually. The same distribution as in the previous case is obtained, but now with some additional manifestly wrong readings.

The number of bad points found on the variable thickness plate used in this study was 5 (out of 357). They always appear close to the edge of the plate. This fact makes them less important, for these regions of the plate are not likely to become part of the absorber. However we should be ready to handle such data when they appear.

Let's imagine the distribution of many readings made at a type II point. It is expected to be gaussian-like with a width of about \(10\mu m\) and a few events very far away from the central value. The probability of getting one such event is small (say \(p<<1\)). If we make three measurements at each point and take as correct the median value, the probability of having a bad reading is of order \(p^{2}\), assuming the three measurements are independent. This is the best result that can be achieved without increasing too much the time of operation per plate. Of course, the possibility of still getting a bad reading can not be discarded. Different selection criteria could be considered but such refinements are probably unnecessary and could always be implemented a posteriori.

In any case, visual inspection of a thickness map should always be performed as a last check. This can be easily done with the PAW package. An example of such a map, taken from a variable thickness plate, is shown on figure 10. As it can be seen there are five bad points. The set of three thickness measurements at each of them gives a spread of 5 to \(10\mu m\). The median value is, thus, a reasonable criterion for choosing the most correct reading. However, in previous runs one of these points gave a manifestly wrong reading. This happened twice. In one of the cases the median value criterion was good enough to remove the erroneous reading and the map looked the same as the one shown; but the other time there were two bad low readings out of three measurements, so the program selected a wrong value.

## 6 Conclusion.

As shown in this paper, the thickness control system for lead plates fulfills the addressed requirements. The measurement process is already on at Madrid. A full description of the results will be given in a new note coming soon. In fact we plan to make available through the World Wide Web all thickness measurements in a few months.
