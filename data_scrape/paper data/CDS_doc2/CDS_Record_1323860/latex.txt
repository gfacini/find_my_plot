The ATLAS physics potential in the searches for high-mass dilepton and lepton-neutrino resonances, are evaluated as a function of the LHC center-of-mass energy \(\sqrt{s}\), for a few values of the total integrated luminosity. The evaluation is done using benchmark models in which new heavy gauge bosons (denoted as \(W^{\prime}\), \(Z^{\prime}\)) have the same couplings as their Standard Model counterparts.

Introduction

This note explores the potential of the search for heavy gauge bosons in various LHC running scenarios. Specifically, the searches for dilepton and lepton-neutrino resonances (where _lepton_ stands for electron or muon) are studied for \(\sqrt{s}=\)7, 8 and 9 TeV, and assuming total integrated luminosities between 1 and 10 fb\({}^{-1}\). A recent evaluation of these channels at the current LHC energy of 7 TeV can be found in [1], where the main backgrounds for the \(W^{\prime}\) and \(Z^{\prime}\) searches are found to be the off-shell production of the Standard Model \(W\) and \(Z\) bosons, respectively. In the case of a 1 TeV \(W^{\prime}\) or \(Z^{\prime}\), the signal to background cross section ratios were determined to be about 30:1 in the signal region. In [1] and in earlier studies (see for example [2] and references therein), other backgrounds, such as QCD dijets, \(t\bar{t}\) production, processes in which a photon or a jet fakes an electron, and cosmic rays (either reconstructed as a back-to-back dimuon candidate or as a single muon plus missing transverse energy, providing a \(W^{\prime}\) candidate), have been found to be suppressed well below the SM \(W\)/\(Z\) backgrounds.

Assuming a similar behavior for higher energies, we here concentrate on the dependence of the main background and signal production cross sections on the center-of-mass energy. The study is based on the 'SSM' model, in which the heavy bosons have SM-like couplings to fermions.

## 2 Cross Sections and Expected Number of Events

For each type of heavy boson (\(W^{\prime}\), \(Z^{\prime}\)), the \(\sigma\times\)BR (cross section times branching ratio to \(e\), \(\mu\)) for \(\sqrt{s}=\)7, 8 and 9 TeV were obtained using PYTHIA 6.421 [3] and MRST LO* [4] parton distribution functions. The results are shown in Table 1.

The reach for discovery and limit setting in these channels is obtained from a simple counting approach, using as input the expected number of signal and background events. The expected numbers of events at \(\sqrt{s}=\)7 TeV are obtained applying the selection criteria used in recent searches for \(Z^{\prime}\) and \(W^{\prime}\) (see, for example, [1] and [2]) to the fully simulated MC samples for \(W^{\prime}\) and \(Z^{\prime}\) with masses of 1.0, 1.5, 2.0 and 2.5 TeV (plus 3.0 TeV, only for \(W^{\prime}\)).

The discovery reach is evaluated using the luminosity needed to obtain ten signal events after selection; we adopt this criterion instead of the customary 5\(\sigma\) significance because, in searches with very low

Table 1: Widths and production cross sections times branching ratio for several \(W^{\prime}\) and \(Z^{\prime}\) masses at different values of \(\sqrt{s}\). Values are obtained with PYTHIA using MRST LO* PDF. No cut is applied on the invariant mass of the \(W^{\prime}\) state, and a generator-level cut of \(M_{ll}>\)0.5\(M_{Z^{\prime}}\) is applied for the \(Z^{\prime}\) state.

Figure 1: Luminosity required to set 95% CL exclusion limits for heavy gauge bosons obtained combining the results from the \(e\) and \(\mu\) channels, for three values of the LHC center-of-mass energy.

These results are listed in Table 6, which shows the mass (in TeV) that a \(W^{\prime}\) or \(Z^{\prime}\) signal would need to have to produce ten events for several values of the total integrated luminosity (from 500 pb\({}^{-1}\) to 10 fb\({}^{-1}\)), and the mass below which these states would be excluded (assuming LO SSM cross sections, with the LO* PDF's) for each luminosity and \(\sqrt{s}\) value. Overall, an increase of the LHC center-of-mass energy by 1 TeV increases the physics reach in both the \(W^{\prime}\) and \(Z^{\prime}\) channels by about 10%; for example, the mass limit for the \(W^{\prime}\) (with 0.5 fb\({}^{-1}\)) goes from 2.17 to 2.38 TeV when \(\sqrt{s}\) goes from 7 to 8 TeV, and from 2.38 to 2.56 TeV when \(\sqrt{s}\) goes from 8 to 9 TeV. Doubling the total integrated luminosity has a similar effect in the physics reach.
