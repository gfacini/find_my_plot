**PRESHOWER PERFORMANCES FOR PHOTON IDENTIFICATION**

**INTRODUCTION**

It is well known that to see the Higgs in the two photon channel, a \(\gamma\) - \(\pi\) 0  separation is needed ( with a rejection = 3). This cannot be done with a calorimeter at a radius of \(\approx\) 1.4m ( see [1] and [2]). The purpose of this note is to show what can do a preshower detector as envisaged in EAGLE for this job. Previous simulations on this subject can be found in [1] and [3] and test-beam results from RD3 prototype are given in [4]. Simulations on the response to electrons can be found in [5].

The first section describes the simulation framework and the geometry used in this note. The second section describes the performances for the \(\gamma\) - \(\pi\) 0  separation using the "standard" EAGLEA geometry (with 3 X0 absorber for the preshower) as a function of the granularity of the preshower. The third section gives estimates on the pile-up effect in the Preshower.The requirements on the dynamic range of the preshower are indicated in the fourth section (the requested calibration quality of the preshower is also discussed in this section) and finally in the last section, we estimate the performances of the system as a function of inactive number of X0 before the preshower active part both for the photon identification and for the effect on the energy resolution.

**1) SIMULATION FRAMEWOR**

The EAGLEA geometry with the integrated coil-cryostat design [6] is used for the geometry of the Preshower. The integrated coil-cryostat system covers the region R=115 cm to R=136 cm and gives \(\approx\) 1 X0 at \(\eta\) = 0. A first layer of lead at R=137 cm gives an additional radiation length at \(\eta\) =0. This layer is tapered to compensate the increase of radiation length from the coil and to preserve a total of 2 X0. This can be done up to \(\approx\) 1.2 in \(\eta\) This lead layer is followed by the first active layer of LAr at R=139.5cm consisting in 1 cm of LAr.This first active layer consists of strips giving precise measurement in the \(\phi\) direction. At R=140.5 cm there is a second tapered lead layer giving a total of 3X0. This is under control up to \(\eta\) = 1.55. Finally at R=141cm, there is a second active layer of 1cm of LAr with strips giving precise measurements in the \(\eta\) direction.

In the forward region, the geometry used follows the same principe except that there is no coil in front and therefore there is a little more lead to give the same amount of X0.

This geometry has been implemented in the framework of the DICE program [7] which is used to generate the \(\gamma\) and \(\pi\) 0  events. (The traking central material is included in this simulation. It gives \(\approx\) 15 to 20 % of X0 at \(\eta\) = 0. Note that in the following,we will restrict ourself to events without photon conversion in the inner tracking in the estimations of the efficiencies and rejections of the preshower.Therefore the results on the \(\gamma\)\(\pi\) 0 separation are independent of the central tracking)PAGE 2

2) PHOTON IDENTIFICATION IN THE "STANDARD" SET-UP

a) method used and influence of the width of the strips

The starting point is given by the calorimeter which define the region to investigate in the preshower. This region is typically 0.06*0.06 around the position of the photon candidate in the calorimeter. The next steep is to perform clustering in the preshower in each of the two projections. In the following we will call cluster each local maximum in the energy deposited in the strips exceeding a given value ( typically 5 MIPs in the following) and larger than the two adjacent strips by some other value ( 2 to 3 MIPs in the following). (see Figure 1). The first selection requires to have at most one cluster in each of the preshower projection.

For the events fulfilling this condition, the shape of the shower in the preshower can be investigated. For this purpose,two kind of variables can be defined : the width of the shower (computed as the second order momentum of the strip energy distribution) and the profile of the shower (defined as the ratio between the energy in the maximum strip and the adjacent strip and the total cluster energy which is typically the sum over 5 strips). These variables,computed in each of the preshower projection,are required to be consistent with what is expected for isolated photons. The additional rejection given by this shape analysis after the requirement to have at most one cluster is not very large because of the large fluctuations of this variables for photons (from the fluctuation in the conversion point of the photon).

Figure 2 shows the rejection against 50 GeV \(\pi\) 0 (for 90% efficiency on isolated photons) as a function of the strip width. The variation with the strip width is relatively easy to understand since at 50 GeV and for a distance of 1.4m the separation between the two photons from a \(\pi\) 0 is \(\pi\)mm. At this level a rejection around 2.5 to 3 is obtained.

Finally,the last possibility to reject \(\pi\) 0 is to compare the position of the shower given by the calorimeter and the position given by the preshower.For an isolated photon, these two measurements should be the same (within the resolution) while for a \(\pi\) 0, one can expect to have a difference if the photons have different conversion point. The extreme case is if only one photon is converted in the preshower : The preshower position is the position of this photon and the calorimeter position is the \(\pi\) 0 position. These two positions differ by = 3.5mm if the decay is symetric and this difference is larger than the expected resolution in the measurement. Unfortunately this game can only be done in one direction : the \(\phi\) direction, because in the \(\eta\) direction the effect of the vertex spread (sigma = 6cm) gives larger effect than what is expected for \(\pi\) 0.

Figure 3 shows the matching in the phi direction between the calorimeter and the preshower for photons and \(\pi\) 0. The resolution is = 1 mm and is consistent with what has been measured in RD3 test beam (see [8]). A cut on = +-2mm can be used on this variable and Figure 4 shows the total rejection against 50 GeV \(\pi\) 0 (for 90% efficiency) obtained after this cut as a function of the strip width. A rejection close to 4 is obtained for strip width smaller than = 3.5mm. Figure 5 shows the same variation for 75 GeV \(\pi\) 0. At this energy, the rejection is flat up to = 3mm strip width.

At 50 GeV, a more fine tuning of the cuts and also the use of the shape analysis in the calorimeter ( giving a rejection = 1.2 [1,2]) leads to a rejection of = 4.5 (for 90% efficiency).As shown in the previous figures this rejection is not improved if smaller strips are used : At this rejection level, the limitation does not come from cases where the two photons are too close to be distinguished (the minimal separation is in fact significantly larger than the strip width). In fact, the limitation in the rejection comes probably from events in which one photon gives a large energy in the preshower and the second photon gives very little energy (late conversion and/or photon with lower energy, the energy difference between the two photons from a \(\pi\) 0 being a flat distribution). In this case, the "hard" core of the second photon shower in the preshower cannot be seen above the "tail" of the shower of the first photon even if the separation between the two photons is much larger than the strip width. This is illustrated in Figure 6, where exemples of photon and \(\pi\) 0 events in the preshower are shown.

The rejection as a function of the Pt of the particles is shown in Figure 7 at \(\eta\) = 0 (all the rejection values are for 90% efficiency on isolated photons). At 75 GeV, the rejection starts to deteriorate with respect to 50 GeV as naively expected since the separation between the photons becomes smaller. At 25 GeV, with the algorithm used here and "optimized" for 50 GeV, the rejection is also a little bit smaller than at 50 GeV even if the separation between the photons is two times larger. This comes from the cut at = 5 Mips used to define a cluster in the Preshower. For 25 GeV \(\pi\) 0,where photon energies are = 10 GeV,the efficiency of this cuts for converted photons starts to be significantly less than 1 and therefore the algorithm is less able to separate the 2 photon clusters.

Figure 8 shows the rejection as a function of \(\eta\) for Pt = 50 GeV ( in fact, Pt is 50 GeV for all points except the last at \(\eta\) =2.3 where Pt is 42 GeV). As naively expected the rejection is almost flat in the barrel region (up to \(\eta\) =1.6) despite the fact that at \(\eta\) = 1.6 all the preshower absorber is given by the coil.This conclusion is in agreement with [3]. At the beginning at the End-Cap, the rejection is also identical,since the separation between the two photons from a \(\pi\) 0 is the same. Naively, if the only important parameter is the separation between the photons, one would have expect that at \(\eta\) = 2.3 and Pt=42 GeV, the rejection would have been the same than at \(\eta\) =0 and Pt=70 GeV (because for these two values, the separation between the photons, expressed in cm, is the same). In fact, the rejection obtained at \(\eta\) = 2.3 is a little better than expected from this consideration. This difference is not very significative statistically but maybe this is an effect from the larger photon energies and from the more compactness of the Preshower absorber. Note that in the End-Caps a constant width of the strips in \(\eta\) or \(\phi\) is assumed and therefore the width is a little less than 2mm at \(\eta\) =2.3 if we start with 3mm in the barrel. If a constant width in mm is assumed, no big effect is expected (see Figures 4 and 5).

The rejection has also been studied in the region between the barrel and the End-Cap ( \(\eta\) =1.6 to 1.8). In this region the resolution on the photon energe is deteriorated by a factor = 2 (For 50 GeV Pt photons). The rejection obtained are at the level of = 3.

In conclusion, for the "standard" geometry used here adequate rejections are obtained for transverse granularity of the preshower of \(\approx\) 3mm. The variation with Pt and \(\eta\) are essentially under control in the relevant Pt and \(\eta\) range for H -> \(\gamma\) \(\gamma\).

**b) Effect of tilted strips**

In the previous simulation, the strips were assumed to be parallel to the direction of the particles from the vertex. In a real preshower, it will be more interesting to have tilted strips such that each line from the vertex cross two strips. This will allow a better efficiency for minimum ionizing particles and also the use of barycenter method to achieve better position resolution for muons. One the other hand, one may expect that tilted strips are a little less sensitive for a shape analysis. In order to investigate an eventual effect on the photon identification, events have been generated with a granularity corresponding to tilted strips ( for a width of 3mm) The rejection obtained at 50 GeV is the same than the rejection quoted in the previous section within = 10% (statistical error from the Monte-Carlo).Therefore one can conclude that the effect on the photon identification is essentially negligible.

**c) Charge collection effect for untilted strips**

In the case of untilted strips,one has to take into account charge collection effect : if the charge is deposited at a distance from the electrode smaller than the drift distance corresponding to the integration time only a fraction of the charge is shown [9]. This is shown in Figure 9.It has been checked that this effect is negligible for the photon identification. However, for Minimum Ionizing Particles, the effect is dramatic and therefore tilted strips are preferables

d) two active layers after 3 X0?

In the previous simulation, the two active layers were at different position : the first layer after 2 X0 and the second layer after 3 X0. This is mainly justified by a small improvement on the energy resolution - if there is 2 different samplings in the preshower (see [8]). Since the conversion probability is = 80% after 2 X0 and = 90% after 3X0, one may naively expect the rejection against \(\pi\) 0  to improve if both layers are after 3 X0. This has been simulated and in fact the rejection obtained with this configuration is very close to the rejection quoted in a) (difference smaller than = 10%). This comes mainly from the fact that the first sampling gives precise measurements in the \(\phi\) direction and therefore allows also some rejection even if only one photon is covered in this sampling.However,as will be shown in the next section, a configuration with both samplings after 3X0 is probably a little less sensitive to pile-up and electronic noise because the signal is larger. The question of the total amount of X0 in the preshower will be adressed in section 4.

3) Pile-up in the preshower

The estimation of pile-up in the preshower is crucial in the definition of the length of the strips. In the following,we will investigate two effects: 1) On the measurement of minimum ionizing particles ( like \(\mu\) ), 2) on the efficiency to identify photons.

The first steep is to have an order of magnitude of the shaping time used in the preshower. For the electronic noise, we assume a ICON chip noise with a parallel noise reduced by a factor 2 [10]. This gives a parallel noise of = 2000 electrons and a serie noise of = 80 electrons/pF,for a peaking time of = 55 ns (for the triangle preshower signal). For the same peaking time, the signal of 1 MIP in the preshower is = 11000 electrons ([11]). The capacitance of the detector is obtained by scaling from the small preshower prototype of RD3 ( 15 pF for 5 cm length and 2.54 mm for the strip width).

For the pile-up, using events generated by M.Nessi.it can be seen that the RMS of the energy deposited in one strip is (in MIPs), for a width of 3mm and at \(\eta\) =0

0.25*sqrt(length/12cm)*sqrt(peaking time /70ns)*sqrt(L/1.6*10**34)

Using these inputs,it is possible to optimize the shaping time to minimize the quadratic sum of the electronic noise and the pile-up RMS, for each strip length. The results are illustrated in Figure 10.for L=1.6*10**34 cm-2s-1. This figure shows the optimum value of the time constant t of the CR2RC4 shaper (the peaking time to a triangular signal is = 5 t) as a function of the detector capacitance which is just proportional to the length for a constant width of 3mm ( 10 cm length corresponds to = 25 pF).The electronic noise and the total noise at the optimum are also shown. For this study, the parallel noise,expressed in electrons, is scaled in sqrt ( ) and the serie noise in 1.sqrt( \(\tau\) ). The deficit balistic in the conversion MIPs to electrons is computed assuming a total drift time in the preshower of 200 ns. Since the parallel noise gives quite large contribution in the noise, the behaviour of these curves is significantly different from what can be obtained for the calorimeter, where the serie noise dominates.In particular, the electronic noise at the optimum is not more given by the total noise divised by 2. The optimum peaking time if = 75 to 100 ns and the electronic noise is = 0.10 to 0.15 MIPs almost independently of the strip length in the range 5 to 20 cm. For L=3.3*10**34 cm-2s-1, the peaking time is expected to decrease by = 20 % and the electronic noise to increase by 20-40 %. Therefore, in the following we shall assume a peaking time of 75 ns and an electronic noise of = 0.1 Mips per strip, independently of the strip length and of the luminosity. To have more accurate estimate of the electronic noise will need a better knowledge of the electronic used for the preshowera) **Pile-Up effect on muon measurements**

For the muon measurement, typically 2 adjacent strips are used (see [8]). Figure 11 shows the energy in 2 adjacent strips of the second sampling from the noise and the pile-up, for various length of the strips,for different pseudorapidities ( 0,1.5 and 2.5) for a luminosity of 3.3*10**34 cm-2s-1 (using a bunch separation of 30ns. The change of the bunch separation between 15 and 30 as gives negligible effect at constant luminosity). The distribution is also shown at \(\eta\) = 0 for L=1.6*10**34 cm-2s-1. The RMS scales with sqrt(L) as naively expected. The effect of non-gaussian tails, shwon in Figure 12,which indicates the probability to have an energy deposition exceeding a given value in two adjacent strips, increases linearely with the luminosity. Note that for this study, a constant length in \(\eta\) or \(\phi\) is assumed and therefore the length (in cm) is reduced in the End-Caps with respect to the barrel. Since the pile-up is constant in the \(\eta\)\(\phi\) space, this is certainly better to avoid too large effects from the pile-up in the End-Caps.

As can be seen in Figure 12,to measure the muon in the preshower, the strip length should probably not exceed 10 cm in the barrel (assuming that we are able to achieve an electronic noise at the level of \(\approx\) 0.1 MIPs/strip)

**b) **Pile-Up effect on photon identification**

To investigate the effect of the pile-up on the photon identification, taking into account the effect of non-gaussian tails,the energy deposited by the pile-up in the preshower after shaping and the electronic noise are superposed to isolated photon events and the inefficiency from the pile-up of the cuts used to separate photons and \(\pi\) 0 is computed as a function of the strip length. The cuts used here give an efficiency of \(\approx\) 92% for isolated photon without pile-up and a rejection of \(\approx\) 3.6 against \(\pi\) 0 (at 50 GeV). The results is shown in Figure 13, for 50 GeV Pt and at \(\eta\) = 0. It can be seen that for strip length smaller than \(\approx\) 10 cm, the inefficiency from pile-up and noise effects is smaller than 5 % and that this inefficiency increases almost linearely with the strip length.

It should be noticed that the variables used to identify the photons have not all the same sensitivity to the pile-up effect.The number of clusters reconstructed and the variables like the width and the profile of the cluster are for exemple more sensitive than the position matching between the calorimeter and the preshower which is essentially independant of the pile-up ( see Figure 14).

**4) DYNAMIC RANGE OF THE PRESHOWER**

Two aspects will be investigated : 1) The dynamic range needed for the energy measurement in order not to affect the intrinsic performances of the calorimeter ( 10%/sqrt(E) + 0.5% ), 2) The dynamic range needed for the photon identification ( this task needs the use of the high granularity of the preshower while this is not the case for the energy correction which can be done using a granularity of the order of the calorimeter granularity).

a) **Dynamic range for the energy correction**

As shown by simulations [12] and test-beam results [8], the measurement of the energy deposited in the preshower is needed to compensate for the fluctuations of the energy loss in the preshower. These fluctuations are obviously decreasing with the energy of the incident particle (electron or photon) and therefore this correction is needed up to an energy at which this fluctuation is = 0.5 to 1%. Since the total energy released in the preshower is (slowly) increasing with the energy, the upper part of the dynamic range needed to apply this correction is determined by the value of the energy deposited in the preshower at the energy where the fluctuation is = 1%. Figure 15 shows the contribution on the energy resolution from the fluctuations in the energy loss in the preshower, for electrons as a function of the electron energy. This simulation is performed at \(\eta\) = 0 using the "standard" geometry. (note that for this, the shower development in the calorimeter has not been simulated in order to avoid prohibitive computer time). From this figure, it can be seen that one needs to correct up to energies of = 1 TeV. The results of this curve are comparables with the extrapolation of the RD3 test beam results [8] (Note that the geometry is not exactly the same and therefore small differences can be expected).

Figure 16 shows the values of the energy released in each sampling of the preshower as the function of the electron energy. Both the average value and the value corresponding to 5% events above are shown. The average value is consistent with [8] ( in fact, this simulation gives values = 20% larger) The distributions of the preshower energies for 1 TeV electrons are shown in Figure 17. From this curve, one can conclude that the energy measurement in the preshower should give a total dynamic range of = few Mips to = 10\({}^{\bullet\bullet}\)3 Mips.

**b) Dynamic range for the photon identification**

Concerning the dynamic range for photon identification (which needs the full preshower granularity), the lower value should be given by the electronic noise value and therefore should not exceed = 0.3 mip/strip. The maximal value is given by the energy deposited by = 100 GeV Et photons. Such photons at \(\eta\) = 0 can give up to 50 Mips in one strip of the first sampling and up to = 100 Mips in one strip of the second sampling ( with a strip width of = 3mm). At larger rapidities, the photon energy becomes larger and the energy released in the preshower is a little larger. Therefore the dynamic range for the photon identification should cover = 0.1 - 0.3 Mips to = 100-150 Mips

**c) calibration of the preshower**

For the Energy measurement, since the energy deposited in the preshower changes from \(\approx\) 20 % at low energy to = 5 % at high energy,a calibration of the energy measurement at the level of few % is clearly sufficient.

For the photon identification, using the simulation discussed previously,it can be seen that the effect on the efficiency/rejection is essentially negligible with up to = 20 % strips to strips fluctuations (the strip width is 3mm in this simulation).

For the resolution on the position measurement for muons,a strips to strips miscalibration of 20% gives = 400 microns contribution on the resolution (for a width of 3 mm). This is significantly larger than the resolution of = 350 microns measured on test-beam [8] (with a signal/noise ratio of 9.5) and therefore the calibration of the strips should probably be controlled at the level of = 10%.

**5) How many X0 DO WE NEED IN THE PRESHOWER?**

In the previous sections we have assumed a total of 3X0 before the calorimeter. This value is a compromize between the effect on the energy resolution and the efficiency to reject \(\pi\) 0 which needs a large conversion probability for photons. To see if 3 X0 is close to the optimum as naively expected, we have investigated the performances of a system with 2,3,4 and 5 X0 in front of the calorimeter. For simplification the two active layers of the preshower are after the same amount of X0.All the other features of the geometry are the same than in the previous sections. The simulation is performed at \(\eta\) = 0 and at Pt= 50 GeV.

The variation of the rejection with the number of X0 is given in Figure18 (no attempt has been made to achieve the best "fine-tuning" of the cuts for each point. In particular, the same method is always used and only the numerical values of the cuts are changed to try to achieve good rejection while preserving the 90% efficiency on photons). It can be seen that 3 X0 gives a rejection significantly better than 2. 4 and 5 X0 are marginally better,the rejection being almost flat between 3 and 5 X0.It should however be noticed that a preshower with more material is a little less sensitive to pile-up and noise because the signal is larger.

**b) Effect on the energy resolution**

The effect on the energy resolution for 50 GeV photons is shown in Figure 19 If no correction is applied, large effects can obviously be seen. If the energy loss in the preshower is used, the resolution is almost constant with up to 4 X0 before the first active,ers and starts to deteriorate with 5 X0 (note that the plate geometry for the calorimeter used in this simulation gives intrinsic calorimeter performances at the level of 8.5%/sqrt(E), a little better than the 10%/sqrt(E) expected for a liquid Argon accordion calorimeter)

Of course, 50 GeV photons are not very sensitive to the matter in front of the calorimeter and therefore the same simulation has also been made with 15 GeV electrons. The result is illustrated in Figure 20. As expected, the resolution deteriorates more rapidly than for photons and for exemple 3 X0 is = 10% worse than 2 X0 only. For this figure,the total energy deposited in the calorimeter has been used, in order to reduce the effect of Bremstrahlung in the inner detector. If one restricts for exemple to 5*5 cells in the calorimeter ( corresponding to an area of 0.1*0.1 in the \(\eta\)\(\phi\) space), non gaussian tails are induced and the difference between 2 X0 and 3 X0 before the first active layer becomes smaller than 10%. (because the brenstrahlung effect is independant of the amount of X0 in the preshower).

**c) conclusion**

For the H \(\rightarrow\)\(\gamma\)\(\gamma\) channel, Figure 21 shows the quality factor (proportionnal to the statistical significance of the signal) defined as 1./sqrt(resolution)*sqrt(0.8* e ( \(\pi\) )**2 + 0.3* e ( \(\pi\) ) +1) (the significance scales with 1./sqrt(resolution) and and 1./sqrt(background) where the background is the sum of the irreducible background, the jet-jet background which is = 0.8*irreducible without preshower and the photon-jet background which is = 0.3*irreducible without preshower).The resolution used here is the quadratic sum of the resolution presented in the previous section and of a 1% constant term.

Of course, this quality factor should not be taken too seriously since it does not include the uncertainties in the jet background rate and in the jet rejection. However, it seems that this "quality factor" is almost flat between 3 and 4 X0 for the preshower. This is just a reflect that the rejection against \(\pi\) 0 is almost flat in this region and that the effect on the energy resolution for photon is essentially negligible. For a complete optimisation of the preshower, the impact on the energy resolution for electrons has also obviously to be taken into account. For low energy electrons, the resolution starts to deteriorate if there is more than 3 X0 before the first active layer. These considerations lead to a preshower design with = 3 X0 which has adequate performances for electrons and photons. This optimum is quite flat for photons. Of course, it is possible to consider also all the possibilities with absorber between the two active layers of the preshower (like in the "standard" geometry), for exemple, to have 2.5 X0 before the first layer and 4 X0 before the second layer,etc. (This may allow better compromize between the energy resolution and the photon identification).

## Conclusions

In this note we have discussed the preshower performances for the photon identification and we have shown that adequate performances are obtained to be able to perform H -> \(\gamma\) \(\gamma\) search, with the geometry actually envisaged. The granularity of the preshower strips should probably be around = 0.002 * 0.06 in the \(\eta\) - \(\phi\) space. (this granularity gives = 3*10**5 channels for the barrel and = 2*10**5 channel for the End-Caps,up to 2.6 in \(\eta\) ). The first number is given by the requested performances for \(\pi\) 0 rejection while the second number comes from pile-up considerations. Such granularity may also allow to see the muons if the electronic noise is low ( = 0.1 Mips/strip). The dynamic range should cover around 3 decades both for the photon identification and for the energy measurement ( but not the same decades for these two jobs). Finally, the choice of 3 \(\chi\)0 for the total absorber material seems to be in a quite flat optimum plateau for the H -> \(\gamma\) \(\gamma\) channel and is still acceptable for the low energy electrons.
