**ABSTRACT**

We have designed and fabricated a feedthrough system that meets the ATLAS baseline requirements. The critical parts are the 960 pin cryogenic feedthrough and the mating connectors. Each pin on the feedthrough carries one signal and the grounds are carried by the metal housing. The feedthrough technology used has been shown to be very robust and provides a secure signal connection mechanism for the overall ATLAS cryogenic system. The connectors can be used with either flat stripline cables or minicoax cables. Flat cables are used to carry the signal from the cold surface to the warm surface. This design is used to minimize the heat transfer into the cryostat. There are 1920 signals per assembly. Two 960 pin cryogenic feedthroughs are mounted on each of two stainless steel flanges. One flange mates to the cold wall and the other flange to the warm wall. A stainless steel bellows connecting the two flanges serves to isolate the feedthrough vacuum from the cryostat vacuum. The cost of the assembly per channel, including the connectors and the connections to the preamp cables and to the intermediate amplifier cables totals a little under $10 US or 13 CHF. The feedthrough assemblies can be constructed and tested offsite. Subsequently they can then be shipped to the cryostat assembly area ready to be connected to the calorimeter signal cables and bolted in place.

**Feedthrough**

**A simple cost-effective way of doubling the signal density of a feedthrough is to use a single pin per channel. The signal is carried by the pin and the ground is carried by the metal housing. Of course in a standard connector where a pair of pins is usually used to carry the signal and ground, more than one channel ground could share a single ground pin. However, that approach degrades the feedthrough performance by increasing inductance and channel to channel cross talk. Using the metal housing to carry the ground has several very important side benefits. It essentially halves the cost per signal because the ground for each channel does not require a separate pin. A conducting sheet instead of a pin carries the ground thus drastically lowering the feedthrough inductance and the channel to channel crosstalk. Since the fins act as an electric shield between adjacent rows of pins, this restricts the cross talk to only the two adjacent channels. The feedthrough fins also act as mechanical stiffeners and thus reduce the deflection of the feedthrough under pressure. Reducing the deflection lowers the stress changes on the ceramic insulators. The fins also securely support each connector. Under operating pressure conditions the fins reduce the bending of the feedthrough by a factor of fifty-five. Since each row of pins takes a separate connector, the wiring of the connectors is much simpler, cheaper and more secure than is the case where multiple rows must be connected.**

**Figure 1a is an engineering drawing of the feedthrough designed for the ATLAS baseline. Type 304 stainless steel makes up the housing. Gold plated Inconel pins carry the signals. The feedthrough has 30 rows each containing 32 pins for a total of 960 pins. A proprietary ceramic made by Pacific Coast Technologies( PCT) seals the pins in place. Each pin carries one signal. The pin pitch is 2 mm within a row and 6 mm separates the rows. The housing carries the ground. The housing couples to the cable connector ground by means of the fins separating each row of pins. Springs on the connector that contact the fins carry the ground from each channel.**

**Including the weldment around the boundary of the feedthrough, the signal density is 17 mm**2 **per channel. At the ends of each row of pins there arerealings to which the connectors latch. A similar design containing 480 pins has been pressure tested with helium to four bars at liquid nitrogen temperatures and found to have no measurable leaks to the limit of sensitivity of 10-9 bar cc/sec.

Figure 1b shows a plot of the feedthrough deflection under pressure. The measured deflection versus pressure is modeled very well by that calculated for a simply supported beam. We use this deflection to calculate how much the tension in the stainless steel surrounding the ceramic insulator is reduced on the convex side of the neutral plane. If the tension were to fall to zero, there might be cause for concern that the ceramic might begin to separate from the stainless steel. However a calculation shows that there is still a factor of 55 safety margin at the full operating pressure and temperature. See APPENDIX A.

### Connector

Figure 2a shows an exploded view of the connector that mates with the feedthrough. We construct each connector from three types of injection molded Vectra parts. The minicoax cables and strip lines require slightly different versions of the cover. The cover piece used with the minicoax cables has round holes in the cover for each channel whereas the cover piece used with the strip line has a single slit. We glue each cable or strip line to the cover after assembly to provide a secure strain relief. The signal lines are soldered to commercial 2 mm socket strips also made of Vectra. For our tests we use a version of socket strip manufactured by Samtec*. The socket strips mate with the pins on the feedthroughs.- One end of a spring presses snugly on a ground plane of the strip line or on the exposed ground shields of the minicoax cables and the other end presses against a fin on the feedthrough. We mechanically tested this assembly by watching for changes in the transmitted signal while yanking on the cable to the point of cable damage. We observed no change in signal.

### Stripline Cable

The calorimeter generates the signals in the cold interior of the cryostat and the signals must be transmitted to the warm exterior. It is very important that this connection have a low heat transport. To this end we have developed a 32 channel 50 \(\Omega\) stripline using printed circuit technology on Kapton. The heat draw is about 6 mW per channel. We measured the nearest neighbor cross talk to be 0.35% for a step function with a 1 ns rise time. The 0.35% includes the non-negligible cross talk of the connections used in the measurement.

Figure 2c shows the variation in impedance we have achieved among the channels on the stripline cables. The plot shows better than a 1% rms spread. We have been able to control the variation in line width of the traces very accurately using the University of Washington's Linotronic L300, a laser and film printing system. The cables are made of copper Kapton printed circuit boards and have half ounce copper on the ground planes and one ounce copper for the signal traces. More details are found in APPENDIX B.

### Electrical Tests

We carried out the following electrical tests on our 480 channel feedthrough. We have made a simple modification to our stripline cable connectors to adapt them to a 40 \(\Omega\) mini coax made by Fileca1. The adaptation was straight forward. Wiring the coax to the connector was simple and the results look very good.

Footnote 1: The cable is manufactured by a French company, Fileca, and was supplied to us by Pierre

Footnote 2: This is the pulse condition prescribed by C. de la Taille of LAL, Orsay, for comparison and qualification of feedthrough systems.

Using the minicoax cables we measured the cross talk from a step function input with a 20 ns rise time3. Figure 3a shows the oscilloscope traces. The maximum amplitude of the cross talk was -3.9 mV from a +2.4 volt step. These measurements give an inductive crosstalk to an adjacent channel of 0.2% in amplitude. We viewed the output signal through a 50 ns RCCR shaper as shown in Figure 3b. In this case the maximum amplitude was 0.06%. However, at the correct timing point (i.e. the peak of the driving pulse)the cross talk was essentially 0 (i.e., <0.01%). The next nearest neighbor had a cross talk at peak amplitude about a factor of five smaller than the nearest neighbor as shown in Figure 3c.

We also tested the feedthrough and connector for cross talk with 1 ns rise time pulses. Here the cross talk was about 1% at peak amplitude with a FWHM of about 1 ns. Figure 3d shows the trace. The reflection for this pulse was measured to be 2.4% in peak amplitude. This amplitude is the same as that observed for a BNC barrel connector.

### Assembly Design

The ATLAS feedthrough assembly is composed of two stainless steel flanges connected by a stainless steel bellows and is very similar to the GEM baseline design. The bellows serves to isolate the feedthrough vacuum from the cryostat vacuum and still provides movement between the cold and warm vessels. The cables carrying the signals from the cold surface to the warm surface are protected from damage by being contained within the bellows. Figures 4a and 4b provide assembly drawings of the concept developed for GEM. For ATLAS two 960 channel feedthroughs are welded to each flange. Flat cables are made of Kapton and for ATLAS provide 32 stripline channels to carry the signal from the cold to the warm surfaces. The loop in the cables shown in Figure 4a provides the needed flexibility between the warm and cold ends. The connectors are described earlier in this report.

The costs associated with the feedthrough assembly are listed in the table below. Included are all costs of the assembly as well as the costs of the connectors and connections to the cables from the preamplifiers and to the cables to the intermediate amplifiers. The costs of the feedthroughs, connectors and bellows are based on bids by vendors. The cost of the minicoax cable is based on information from the manufacturer1. In house fabrication estimates were used for the assembly and printed circuit cable costs.

Since there are 1920 channels on a feedthrough assembly, the feedthrough and cable costs are $17,952.00 US. This does not include the cost of the flange assembly or the cost of the prototypes. The flange assembly includes the machining of two flanges, bellows and welding the parts together. We estimate the flange assembly to cost $1,025 US. (If done in the University of Washington shop the assembly would cost $737 US.) The high voltage feedthroughs and cables are also not yet included in the cost nor are low voltage power feedthroughs and cables if the signal feedthrough is not adequate. However, PCT has advised us that they can substitute chrome-copper pins for some of the Inconel pins in our feedthrough. The chrome-copper pins have 60% of the conductivity of pure copper.

### Technology Considerations

Although the signal lines could be soldered directly to the feedthroughs, we believe the present design using connectors to attach the signals is both more robust and cheaper to fabricate. This conclusion is partly based on our extensive experience with the SLD connections. We were responsible for the cold to warm transition wiring of the 40K barrel channels of the SLD. We found that wiring directly to the two dimensional pin arrays of that system to be both time consuming and awkward. Working directly on the flange with many cables hanging from it was not the best environment in which to make good solder joints. Decoupling the soldering, so that it may be performed away from the flange and other wires, is a far superior procedure. In this case, the required connections are all in a plane which makes access easy for both soldering and inspection. Wave soldering techniques can be employed which are fast, cheap and reliable.

The coupling of the signals to the feedthrough pins is made with commercial strip sockets, a technique very similar to that used for connecting the preamplifiers to the motherboards. Two pin and socket connections are made per channel for the internal cable. This is a small number of socket connections compared to the eight such connections required for each preamplifier that we used in our recent CERN beam tests. Once the cables are sealed inside the bellows, the connections should remain completely stable.

It might be tempting to think that a feedthrough system that uses cables potted in the flanges might provide some improved electrical capabilities. There is little or no performance history that can be used to judge the long term reliability of such designs. It will be not only very hard but also expensive to devise tests that can guarantee such long term reliability. However, the extremely low cross talk and reflection of our feedthroughs essentially removes any such perceived advantage. A design proposed by an IBM group (now dissolved) required an interface board at the ends of the cables. This potted cable approach essentially traded the connections to a feedthrough with connections to an interface board. The cable designs also suffer from not providing a stable platform into which the cables from the modules can be plugged. Furthermore, if a cable is damaged it cannot be unplugged and replaced. We wish to emphasize again that the pin and socket connections used in our design are the same as those used for the amplifiers and they do not present any undue risk to the reliability of the read out chain.

Summary

We have designed and fabricated a feedthrough system that meets the ATLAS base line requirements. The critical parts are the 960 pin cryogenic feedthrough and the mating connectors. Each pin on the feedthrough carries one signal and the grounds are carried by the metal housing. The feedthrough technology used has been shown to be very robust and provides a secure signal connection mechanism for the overall ATLAS cryogenic system. The connectors can be used with either flat stripline cables or miricoax cables. Flat cables are used to carry the signal from the cold surface to the warm surface. This design is used to minimize the heat transfer into the cryostat. There are 1920 signals per assembly. Two 960 pin cryogenic feedthroughs are mounted on each of two stainless steel flanges. One flange mates to the cold wall and the other flange to the warm wall. A stainless steel bellows connecting the two flanges serves to isolate the feedthrough vacuum from the cryostat vacuum. The cost of the assembly per channel, including the connectors and the connections to the preamp cables and to the intermediate amplifier cables totals a little under $10 US or 13 CHF. The feedthrough assemblies can be constructed and tested offsite. Subsequently, the assemblies can then be shipped to the cryostat assembly area ready to be connected to the calorimeter signal cables and bolted in place.

it provides flexibility in the direction perpendicular to the loop. This flexibility allows the cold end to move freely with respect to the warm end.

## Appendix A Structural Analysis of Rectangular Cryogenic Feedthrough - 960 pin version.

When pressurizing a connector feedthrough, an unloading of the ceramic surrounding the signal pins occurs due to bending in the connector body. A study of the sealing properties can be made by treating a 6 mm section centered on a fin as an independent beam.

The rectangular block outside measurements are 3.355" along the pin row direction and 7.460" in the direction perpendicular to the pin rows. Part of the block area is supported in the weld prep. area. The rest of the connector block bridges the hole cutout in the plate to which it is mounted. It is the bridged area that must support the pressure load on the feedthrough. Due to the non isotropic design of the feedthrough, analysis can be done in the direction shown below since the fins are the dominate structural element when considering deflection.

The actual bridging area, which must support the applied pressure, measures 7.210" X 3.107".

Deflection of rectangular block in the fin direction:

Assuming a simply supported beam, uniformly loaded (100 psi), the deflection, f, is given as:

\[\text{f}=5\text{WL}^{3}/384\text{EI}\]

\[\text{where,}\qquad\text{I}=\text{I}_{1}+2\text{I}_{2}\qquad\quad\text{I}_{1}= \text{bh}^{3}/12=.039(.648)^{3}/12=0.000884\]

\[\text{I}_{2}=\text{bh}^{3}/12=.086(.150)^{3}/12=0.000024\]Conclusion:

A possible gap opening created around the feedthrough ceramic due to 100 psi loading is held non-existent by a safety factor of 55 due to the compressive loading of ceramic insulator around the pin. The compressive force is created in the manufacture/curing cycle due to the \(\Delta\)l/l differential shrink between the SS 304 body and the Kryoflex insulator material. At LAr temperature, the margin of safety becomes even greater.

## Appendix B Fabrication of stripline cables

The fabrication of flexible cables for the signal feedthrough is described in this appendix.

Each cable consists of 32 transmission lines of tri-plate geometry. The signal traces are 5 mil wide. The traces are photo-etched into a layer of one-ounce (0.67 mil) copper carried by a piece of 5 mil flexible printed circuit board material. Another piece of the material is glued over the traces. The outer surfaces of the assembly carry ground planes of one-half-ounce (1.34 mil) copper.

The desired layout of the signal traces is translated into a postscript file by means of a FORTRAN program. The photo-etching mask is created directly from the postscript file with the Linotronic L-300 printer operated by University of Washington Publication Services. This device uses a laser beam to create the image directly on a 12-inch-wide roll of photographic film with a resolution of 2540 dots per inch. The positions of the trace edges on the output film are found to have a periodic error with a peak-to-peak amplitude of 0.3 dot (period 6 dots) in the dimension parallel to the long edge of the film roll. In the other dimension the measured and requested trace positions agree within the limits of our measuring microscope (0.1 dot or better). When the 13.6-inch long cables are arranged to fit on an \(11\times 17\)-inch image the trace widths on the film are equal, within our 0.8% measurement uncertainty.

We have fabricated two cables using a sample of circuit board material from ADI/isola. The core of the material is a 5.5 mil layer of glass fabric and polyimide resin (permittivity \(\epsilon=4.44\)). The copper cladding on this particular sample is approximately 0.6 mil thick on one side and 1.0 mil thick on the other. We made the signal traces on the thick copper layer for one cable and on the thin layer for the other.

We prepared the material by cleaning with household cleanser and a ScotchBrite pad. After rinsing and drying, the surfaces were cleaned with acetone and the photoresist film was laminated onto the copper. An exposure time of two minutes in our UV light box was found to be suitable for

\begin{tabular}{l l} then. & I =.000932 in. [4] \\ Young's modulus, E, SS 304 = 28 x 10\({}^{6}\) psi \\ Load per fin = (7.210")(3.107")(100 psi)/ 31 fins = 72.26 lbs./ fin @ 100 psi \\ so, the deflection, f, in the center of a given fin is: \\ f = 5WL\({}^{3}\)/384 EI = 5(72.26 lbs.)(3.107")\({}^{3}\)/(384)(28 x 10\({}^{6}\)psi)(.000932 in [4]) \\ =.00108" \\ \end{tabular} This calculated deflection has been charted against the measured value and found to be in excellent agreement. The actual deflection will be less because the feedthrough will be welded in place.

A deflection of.00108" gives a radius of curvature, R, to the feedthrough:

\begin{tabular}{l l} For neutral axis: \\ R\({}^{2}\) = (Fin length/2)\({}^{2}\) + (R - f)\({}^{2}\) = (3.107/2)\({}^{2}\) + (R -.00108")\({}^{2}\) \\ R = 1117.3" \\ length, l, of neutral axis is: \\ l = 20(2\pi\)R/360" where \(\theta\) = sin\({}^{-1}\)(0/2)/R \\ for 1 = 3.107" and R = 1117.3" \\ \end{tabular}

\(\theta=.0797^{*}\)

length of outer surface of pressurized connector is:

l' = 3.107209"

where \(\theta=.0797^{*}\) and

R = 1117.3" +.075"

(.075" is the distance from the

neutral axis to the outer surface of

the web.)

The difference between the length of the neutral axis and the outer

web surface @ 100 psi is :

\(\Delta\)l = 3.107209"-3.107=0.000209"

so, \(\Delta\)l @ each pin with respect to the neutral axis across a

.028" pin dia. is:

\(\Delta\)l =.028"(.000209")/3.107" = 1.88 x 10-6"

this is the amount of gap that will open by pressurizing connector to

100 psi. and if there were no compression of ceramic insulator around

the pin.

Compression of ceramic around feedthrough pin is:

\(\Delta\)l = (\(\Delta\)l of SS 304 - \(\Delta\)l of Kryoflex ceramic material around pin)

x (\(\Delta\)T)(\(\partial\) of ceramic)

\(\Delta\)l of SS 304 = 17.28 x 10-6 in/in/"C

\(\Delta\)l of Kryoflex = 7.50x 10-6 in/in/"C

Cure temperature of Kryoflex is 400" C so

\(\Delta\)T range to r.t. is 380" C

then,

\(\Delta\)l = (17.28 x 10-6 in/in/"C - 7.50 x 10-6 in/in/"C)(380" C)(.028")

\(\Delta\)l = 1.04 x 10-4" shrink in.028" dia.

Safety factor = 1.04 x 10-4/ 1.88 x 10-6 = 55generating clean signal traces. The photoresist was developed in Electro-brite C11A solution for two minutes at room temperature with continuous brushing along the direction of the signal traces.

The copper was etched in Cycloetch solution at 52\({}^{\circ}\) C. The etching process produces many tiny bubbles which tend to attach themselves along the edges of the traces and distort the traces. We caused the bubbles to burst by lifting the cables out of the etching solution momentarily every few seconds throughout the process. The etching was completed in 4 to 6 minutes, depending on the thickness of the copper to be removed.

A similar procedure was followed to make the ground plane piece with copper on only one side. The two halves of the cable were cut out with scissors and joined with DuPont Pyralux WA/A acrylic adhesive. We used a 1 mil thick b-staged layer of adhesive, cured for 40 minutes at 185\({}^{\circ}\) C and 100 psig.

In the future we intend to use polyimide circuit board material without glass. The lower dielectric constant of such a material would permit wider traces and hence lower DC resistance. Also, the cables would be less brittle and could undergo sharp bends without breaking. We also intend to use polyimide adhesive rather than acrylic for better resistance to radiation damage.
