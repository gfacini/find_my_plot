**Abstract**

We investigate the feasibility of measuring of the rare decay \(B^{0}_{s}\to\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\) in ATLAS. The contribution of inclusive and of the most important non-combinatorial background is studied.

Introduction

The rare decays, \(B_{s}^{0}\to\ell^{+}\ell^{-}\) with \(\ell^{\pm}=e^{\pm},\mu^{\pm},\) or \(\tau^{\pm},\) are mediated by flavour-changing neutral currents that are forbidden in the Standard Model at tree level. The lowest-order contributions in the Standard Model involve weak penguin loops and weak box diagrams that are CKM suppressed. Examples of the lowest-order diagrams are shown in Figure 1. Since the \(B_{s}^{0}\) meson is a pseudoscalar that has positive C parity and the transition proceeds in an \(\ell=0\) state, the electromagnetic penguin loop is forbidden. The two leptons are either both right-handed or both left-handed leading to additional helicity suppression. Thus, branching fractions expected in the Standard Model are tiny.

The early searches for rare \(B\) meson decays started with radiative penguin decays, first observed by CLEO in 1993, where they presented evidence for the exclusive decay \(B\to K^{*}\gamma\) and for the inclusive decay \(B\to X_{s}\gamma\) a year later [1, 2].

The \(B\) factory experiments, BaBar and Belle, have measured these decay modes with more precision. The present world average for the inclusive mode is \(\mathcal{B}(B\to X_{s}\gamma)=(3.55\pm 0.26)\times 10^{-4}\)[3]. BaBar and Belle also observed the decays \(B\to K^{(*)}\ell^{+}\ell^{-}\) and \(B\to X_{s}\ell^{+}\ell^{-}\) that are two orders of magnitude smaller than \(B\to X_{s}\gamma\)[4, 5]. The decay \(B_{s}^{0}\to\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\) is expected to be further reduced by three orders of magnitude.

In extensions of the Standard Model, the \(B_{s}^{0}\to\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\) branching fraction may be enhanced by several orders of magnitude. Thus, several experiments have searched for these decays. The largest \(B_{s}^{0}\) samples have been collected by CDF and D0 corresponding to a luminosity of 2 fb\({}^{-1}\) but no signal has been observed. The lowest branching fraction upper limit was set recently by CDF yielding \(\mathcal{B}(B_{s}^{0}\to\mu^{+}\mu^{-})<5.8\times 10^{-8}\)@95% confidence level [6]. This is still about an order of magnitude higher than the Standard Model prediction. As ATLAS has an elaborate muon system extended over a large region of the solid angle, the dimuon final state is expected to be reconstructed with high efficiency and good mass resolution. Thus, there are good prospects for observing this decay in the dimuon channel and measuring its branching fraction with reasonable precision.

## 2 Theoretical description

The Standard Model amplitude for the process \(B_{s,d}\to\ell^{+}\ell^{-}\) is calculated from the effective Hamiltonian

\[H_{\text{eff}}=-\frac{G_{F}}{\sqrt{2}}\frac{\alpha}{\pi\sin^{2}\theta_{W}}V_{ tb}^{*}V_{tq}(C_{10}(\mu)\mathcal{O}_{10}(\mu)+C_{S}(\mu)\mathcal{O}_{S}(\mu)+C_{P}( \mu)\mathcal{O}_{P}(\mu))+h.c., \tag{1}\]

where \(C_{i}(\mu)\) are Wilson coefficients that present the perturbatively calculable short-distance effects and \(\mathcal{O}_{i}(\mu)\) are local operators that describe the non-perturbative long-distance effects of the transition. The scale parameter \(\mu\) is of the order of the \(b\)-quark mass (\(\sim 5\) GeV), \(\theta_{W}\) is the weak mixing angle, \(\alpha\) is the electromagnetic coupling constant and \(V_{tb}^{*}V_{tq}\) are CKM matrix elements for \(t\to b\) and \(t\to q=s,d\) transitions, respectively.

The dominant contribution results from the axial-vector operator \(\mathcal{O}_{10},\)[7]:

Figure 1: Lowest order Standard Model contributions to \(B_{s}^{0}\to\mu^{+}\mu^{-}.\)

\[{\cal O}_{10}=(\bar{b}_{L}\gamma^{\mu}q_{L})(\bar{\ell}\gamma_{\mu}\gamma_{5}\ell). \tag{2}\]

The Wilson coefficient \(C_{10}\) has been determined in the next-to-leading order (NLO) of QCD. The NLO corrections are in the percent range and higher-order corrections are not relevant [8]. In NLO an excellent approximation in terms of the \(\overline{MS}\) mass of the top quark, \(\bar{m}_{t}\), is given by:

\[C_{10}(\bar{m}_{t})=0.9636\left[\frac{80.4\ {\rm GeV}}{M_{W}}\frac{\bar{m}_{t}}{ 164\ {\rm GeV}}\right]^{1.52}. \tag{3}\]

The measurements of the top quark mass at the Tevatron, \(m_{t}^{pole}=171.4\pm 2.1\ {\rm GeV}\)[9], yield an \(\overline{MS}\) mass of \(\bar{m}_{t}=163.8\pm 2.0\ {\rm GeV}\) and the world average of the W-boson mass is \(m_{W}=80.403\pm 0.029\ {\rm GeV}\). The accuracy of this approximation is \(5\times 10^{-4}\) for masses of \(149\ {\rm GeV}<\bar{\rm m}_{t}<179\ \ {\rm GeV}\).

The other two operators represent scalar and pseudoscalar couplings to the leptons:

\[{\cal O}_{S}=m_{b}(\bar{b}_{R}q_{L})(\bar{\ell}\ell),{\cal O}_{P}=m_{b}(\bar{ b}_{R}q_{L})(\bar{\ell}\gamma_{5}\ell). \tag{4}\]

The Wilson coefficients, \(C_{S}\) and \(C_{P}\), are determined from penguin diagrams that involve the Higgs boson or the neutral Goldstone boson, respectively. Although they are not helicity suppressed, their contributions are tiny in the Standard Model and they may be safely neglected in Standard Model calculations.

The \(B_{q}\to\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\) branching fractions including the scalar and pseudoscalar contributions are given by:

\[\begin{split}{\cal B}(B_{q}^{0}\to\mu^{+}\mu^{-})=\frac{G_{F}^{2} \alpha^{2}}{64\pi^{3}\sin^{4}\theta_{W}}|V_{tb}^{*}V_{tq}|^{2}\tau_{B_{q}}M_{B _{q}}^{3}f_{B_{q}}^{2}\sqrt{1-\frac{4m_{\mu}^{2}}{M_{B_{q}}^{2}}}\\ \times\left[\left(1-\frac{4m_{\mu}^{2}}{M_{B_{q}}^{2}}\right)M_{B _{q}}^{2}C_{S}^{2}+\left(M_{B_{q}}C_{P}-\frac{2m_{\mu}}{M_{B_{q}}}C_{10}\right) ^{2}\right],\end{split} \tag{5}\]

where \(M_{B_{q}}\), \(\tau_{B_{q}}\), and \(f_{B_{q}}\) respectively are mass, lifetime and decay constants of the \(B_{q}\) meson. The decay constant is determined in different models, including quark models, QCD sum rules and unquenched lattice theory. The accuracy is presently of the order of \(10-15\%\). Evaluating \(\alpha\) at the Z-mass scale, \(\alpha(M_{Z})=1/128\), the following predictions were made for the \(B_{q}\to\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\) branchings fractions in the Standard Model [8]:

\[Br(B_{s}^{0}\to\mu^{+}\mu^{-}) = (3.86\pm 0.15)\times\frac{\tau_{B_{s}^{0}}}{1.527\,{\rm ps}}\, \frac{|V_{ts}^{*}V_{tb}|^{2}}{1.7\times 10^{-3}}\,\frac{f_{B_{s}}}{240\,{\rm MeV }}\times 10^{-9}, \tag{6}\] \[Br(B_{d}^{0}\to\mu^{+}\mu^{-}) = (1.06\pm 0.04)\times\frac{\tau_{B_{d}^{0}}}{1.527\,{\rm ps}}\, \frac{|V_{td}^{*}V_{tb}|^{2}}{6.7\times 10^{-5}}\,\frac{f_{B_{d}}}{200\,{\rm MeV }}\times 10^{-10}.\]

In extensions of the Standard Model, such as supersymmetry (SUSY), Higgs doublet models or models with extra gauge bosons, scalar-current, pseudoscalar-current or axial-vector current interactions may arise with new particles in the loop. This yields new contributions in the Wilson coefficients \(C_{10},C_{S}\), and \(C_{P}\). Since the scalar and pseudoscalar operators are not helicity suppressed, they may give rise to a large enhancement of the branching fraction. Furthermore, the contribution of the pseudoscalar operator may produce destructive or constructive interference with the axial vector operator. Thus, new physics may increase or decrease the branching fraction with respect to the Standard Model value. For example, in the minimal supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM), the \(B_{s}^{0}\to\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\) branching fractionsare proportional to \(\tan^{6}(\beta)\)2). The branching fraction of \(B_{d}\to\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\) is expected to be a factor of 40 lower than that for \(B_{s}\to\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\), hence, the latter is the focus of this note.

Footnote 2)\(\tan(\beta)\) is the ratio of vacuum expectation values for charged and neutral Higgs bosons.

## 3 ATLAS strategy for \(B_{s}^{0}\to\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\) study

Measurements of the properties of \(B\) decays with such extremely low branching fractions in ATLAS is possible namely due to the large beauty cross-section and luminosity of the LHC machine. Thus at luminosity \(10^{33}\)\(\mbox{cm}^{-2}\)\(\mbox{s}^{-1}\)\(10^{12}\)\(B\) hadron pairs will be produced each year. It is expected that ATLAS will record \(10^{8}\) events with \(B\) decays each year by using \(B\)-physics triggers [10]. Triggers dedicated to rare dimuon \(B_{s}^{0}\to\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\) decays will be described in the Section 4.2 of this document.

Since the branching fraction is so small in the Standard Model, semileptonic \(B\) decays and even some rare \(B\) decays may yield substantial backgrounds. The key issue for \(B_{s}^{0}\to\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\) discovery at the LHC is the suppression of the backgrounds. The ATLAS strategy for observing \(B_{s}^{0}\to\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\) is as follows.

The first step is to trigger on events containing a \(B_{s}^{0}\to\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\) candidate using dedicated trigger algorithms which are described in this document. In the offline analysis the selections will be refined to reduce backgrounds. To achieve final separation of signal from background we will employ statistical methods based on several variables. Both parts of the offline selection are described in this paper.

Once recorded data are available, the background in the signal region will be estimated using sidebands in the distribution of the muon pair invariant mass. In the current study the background was estimated using simulated events. Two categories of backgrounds were simulated: the so called combinatorial background from \(b\bar{b}\) pairs producing two muons in the final state; and the exclusive backgrounds, coming from two-body hadronic \(B\) decays and from the process \(B_{s}^{0}\to K^{-}\mu^{+}\nu\). The exclusive backgrounds contribute to the signal region and the lower mass sideband only. They do not occur in the higher mass sideband, so their contribution to the signal is estimated separately.

After the number of background events in the signal region has been determined, the number of signal events \(N_{B}\) can be determined from a comparison of the total number of events found in the signal region, and the estimated background. For low statistics an upper limit on \(N_{B}\) corresponding to certain confidence level is determined using appropriate statistical methods. Once \(N_{B}\) is determined the \(B_{s}^{0}\to\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\) branching fraction, \({\cal B}(B_{s}^{0}\to\mu^{+}\mu^{-})\), can be calculated using a relative normalisation to the reference channel \(B^{+}\to J/\psi(\mu^{+}\mu^{-})K^{+}\).

This document presents a Monte Carlo simulation study which follows the strategy described above. We start from the trigger level in Section 4.2. This is followed by the offline analysis, optimisation of discriminating variables and finally the determination of background and signal contribution in the signal regions, in Section 4.4. Systematic uncertainties are analysed in Section 5, followed by the start-up strategy in Section 6.

It should be stressed that due to large uncertainty in the predictions of the \(b\bar{b}\) production cross-section at the LHC energy this paper cannot derive a precise sensitivity to \({\cal B}(B_{s}^{0}\to\mu^{+}\mu^{-})\) at ATLAS but rather to show the ATLAS potential for this study and its discovery capability under some assumptions.

## 4 Monte Carlo study

### Simulation and event selection

The Monte Carlo simulation samples used in the analysis have been generated as part of the central ATLAS Monte Carlo data production runs, and details of this simulation have been given in the introduction to this chapter.

The list of generated signal and background events is given in Table 1.

To ensure that most of the generated dimuon events passed the trigger, only events containing two muons with \(p_{T}\) larger than 6 GeV and 4 GeV, were retained for detector simulation. For the signal channel \(B^{0}_{s}\rightarrow\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\), multiplying the cross-section reported by PYTHIA with the branching ratio \(3.42\times 10^{-9}\) gave a cross-section of 15 fb. 47.5k events have been generated and passed through the full detector simulation and reconstruction. Simulation of pileup has not been available, thus it was not simulated for either the signal or the background events.

The sample of dominant background process events, \(b\bar{b}\) decaying semileptonically giving two muons in the final state, were simulated with the same versions of the software, and with the same kinematic cuts as for the signal. The PYTHIA cross-section for such a sample is estimated to be 110 nb and a total of 146.5k background events that passed the reconstruction stage were used in the physics analysis.

In addition to the combinatorial background, there are several \(B\) backgrounds that may contribute to the signal region. These include two and three body decays where two of the final state particles are \(K^{\pm}\), \(\pi^{\pm}\) or \(\mu^{\pm}\). Although the rate for misidentification of kaons or pions as muons, due to punchthrough or decay in flight, is only of the order 0.5%, the small \(\mathcal{B}(B^{0}_{s}\rightarrow\mu^{+}\mu^{-})\) requires investigation of the other rare \(B\) decays. The decay modes which we consider to be most important are summarised in Table 2.

We have studied one of the two-body and one of the three-body decays with full simulation, namely \(B^{0}_{s}\to K^{-}\pi^{+}\) and \(B^{0}_{s}\to K^{-}\mu^{+}\nu\). Contributions from the other channels were estimated to be similar or smaller. To enable the production of a sizable event sample with decay in flight, a special GEANT simulation option which forces kaons and pions from selected \(B\) mesons to decay in the inner detector volume was developed [12].The position of the decay is randomly selected from a uniform distribution between the origin and the exit point from the inner detector.

### Trigger strategy

We describe trigger methods for selection of the \(B^{0}_{s}\to\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\) channel developed by the \(B\) trigger group as part of the project presented in this document. The full description of the ATLAS B-physics triggers is given in the introduction to the B-physics chapter [10]. The first level trigger (L1) performance for dimuon channels can be found in [13] and details of the second level (L2) dimuon trigger implementation in [12].

At the LHC start-up, the luminosity level is expected to be of order \(10^{31}\)cm\({}^{-2}\)s\({}^{-1}\) and a \(p_{T}\) threshold as low as 4 GeV can be used at L1. The dimuon rate after L1 is expected to be only a few Hz. This admits the possibility of applying L2 track reconstruction in the full volume of the inner detector. This detailed approach allows the study of dimuon background features to understand of their composition. With the subsequent rise of luminosity the L1 \(p_{T}\) threshold will increase to 6. The dimuon rate after L1 is expected to rise to about 360 Hz at \(L=10^{33}\)cm\({}^{-2}\)s\({}^{-1}\) and the L2 track reconstruction in the full volume of inner detector will be replaced by the Region of Interest (RoI) guided mode, documented in [12].

The simulation of the trigger in the current study is performed by applying the strategies for luminosity \(L=10^{33}\)cm\({}^{-2}\)s\({}^{-1}\). At L1 the threshold of \(p_{T}>6\) GeV has been applied and events containing two L1 muon signatures are analysed further using the L2 topological dimuon trigger algorithm with a threshold of \(p_{T}>6\) GeV. Following the RoI defined at L1, the muon candidates are reconstructed in the muon spectrometer, then matched to the tracks reconstructed in the inner detector (inside the RoI) and combined into one track. The invariant mass of two opposite sign muons is required to be less than 7. These muons should also be successfully fitted to a common vertex. Only loose selection criteria are used at this step (\(\chi^{2}<10\)). Implementation of the third level trigger, the event filter (EF), is not finalised yet and the offline reconstruction efficiency is used to estimate the EF efficiency (the same reconstruction algorithms are supposed to be used at EF).

Results on the L1 and L2 efficiencies as well as an estimated EF efficiency for signal \(B^{0}_{s}\to\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\) are given in Table 3. The L1 efficiency is defined as the ratio of the \(B^{0}_{s}\to\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\) events passing the L1 trigger and the input events generated with \(p_{T}>6\) GeV and \(|\eta|<2.5\) for both muons from the \(B^{0}_{s}\to\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\) decay. The L2 efficiency is defined as the fraction of events accepted by L1 satisfying the above L2 reconstruction and selection cuts. The efficiency of the event filter is estimated as the fraction of events that both satisfy L2 and also are successfully reconstructed at EF. These values of the efficiency have been used in the subsequent analysis.

Various types of trigger algorithms and trigger thresholds will be used in the real experiment depending on the luminosity achieved, dedicated computing resources available for the online event processing and the actual beauty yield at LHC energies.

### Event reconstruction and analysis.

Muon reconstruction quality is of high importance for the \(B^{0}_{s}\to\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\) channel. The muon candidates produced by the STACO [14] method were used. This method combines the independently reconstructed inner detector and muon spectrometer tracks. Figure 2 shows the muon reconstruction efficiency as a function of a true muon \(p_{T}\). The efficiency is defined as the number of muon candidates reconstructed and

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|} \hline \hline L1*L2 efficiency & EF w.r1 L2 & Overall trigger eff. \\ \hline
0.52 & 0.88 & 0.46 \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}

matched to the Monte Carlo particle tracks in the corresponding \(p_{T}\) bin divided by number of generated muons. The \(p_{T}\) spectrum of generated muons is superimposed on the efficiency plot.

For the physics analysis, we select events containing identified muon pairs with opposite charges. Aside of the kinematic cuts (\(p_{T}^{\mu_{1}(\mu_{2})}>6(4)\) GeV and \(|\eta_{\mu_{1},\mu_{2}}|<2.5\)) no additional cuts have have been applied. These two muons then constitute a \(B\) meson candidate. The VKalVrt vertexing package [15] is used to fit tracks into a vertex. We require the vertex quality to have \(\chi^{2}<10\). The momentum resolution is important as a narrow mass search window reduces the background contribution. Figure 3 shows the dimuon mass distribution for the cases when both muons are in the barrel region (\(|\eta_{\mu_{1},\mu_{2}}|<1.1\)) or in the end-cap (\(|\eta_{\mu_{1},\mu_{2}}|>1.1\)). The Gaussian fit (using bins with contents \(>10\%\) of maximum) gives \(\sigma=70\) MeV for the barrel and \(\sigma=124\) MeV for the end-cap. We used 90 MeV as an estimate of the invariant mass resolution for the signal events.

In this document we present a cut-based method for signal extraction and background rejection. For the future, we are investigating another method using a boosted decision tree [16].

In the cut based analysis a set of discriminating variables is chosen and using the signal and background simulated events the optimal set of cuts is determined. The signal events are identified by requiring that the dimuon invariant mass is consistent with the mass of \(B_{s}\) meson. To reduce background events where two muons originate from different sources (e.g. independent semileptonic decays of \(b\) and \(\bar{b}\) quarks), the following discriminating variables were chosen (values used in the final analysis are given in parentheses):

* Transverse decay length of the \(B_{s}\) candidate \(L_{xy}\) (\(L_{xy}>\)0.5 mm )
* The pointing angle \(\alpha\) between the dimuon pair summary momentum and the direction of the decay vertex as seen from the primary vertex (\(\alpha<\)0.017 rad )
* Isolation \(I_{\mu\mu}=p_{T}^{\mu\mu}/(p_{T}^{\mu\mu}+\Sigma_{i}p_{T}^{i}(\Delta R<1))\), where the sum is over all tracks with \(p_{T}>1\) GeV (excluding the muon pairs) within a cone of \(\Delta R<1\), where \(\Delta R=\sqrt{(\Delta\eta)^{2}+(\Delta\phi)^{2}}\) and \(\Delta\eta\) and \(\Delta\phi\) are the pseudorapidity and azimuthal angle of track \(i\) with respect to the momentum vector of the muon pair ( \(I_{\mu\mu}>0.9\) ).

Figure 2: Muon offline reconstruction efficiency as a function of \(p_{T}\). The superimposed histogram - \(p_{T}\) spectrum of muons in the signal events (right scale).

* An asymmetric search window for \(M_{\mu\mu},\in[M_{B^{0}_{d}}-\sigma,M_{B^{0}_{s}}+2\sigma]\), is used to avoid a possible contribution from \(B^{0}_{d}\rightarrow\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\) decay.

Figures 4, 5 and 6 show distributions of discriminating variables for signal and background events.

Due to the low Monte Carlo statistics, it is not feasible to perform a cut analysis as in a real experiment (i.e. applying all cuts simultaneously) since this will leave no events for the analysis. However, some of the discriminating variables show no (or small) correlations between each other. This allows the estimation of the rejection power of such variables separately. Then the product of all efficiencies can provide a reasonable estimate of the total rejection. Table 4 shows a correlation matrix for the variables used in this study. The correlation between the pointing angle \(\alpha\) and the transverse decay length \(L_{xy}\) is higher than among other variables so the pointing angle and the transverse decay length are examined simultaneously to take their correlation into account. The systematic uncertainty due to this correlation is estimated as +50%.

Figure 7 illustrates the rejection power of each cut. One cut is applied at a time to the combinatorial background events and to the \(B^{0}_{s}\to K^{-}\mu\nu\) and \(B^{0}_{s}\to K^{-}\pi^{+}\) events where one or two hadrons are misidentified as a muon. The combinatorial background is effectively suppressed by these cuts while the

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c c c c|} \hline \hline  & \(M_{\mu\mu}\) & \(I_{\mu\mu}\) & \(\alpha\) & \(L_{xy}\) \\ \hline \(M_{\mu\mu}\) & 1 & -0.09 & 0.04 & -0.03 \\ \(I_{\mu\mu}\) & & 1 & -0.07 & -0.03 \\ \(\alpha\) & & & 1 & -0.17 \\ \(L_{xy}\) & & & & 1 \\ \hline \end{tabular}

non-combinatorial events are less well rejected.

Table 5 summarizes the output of this cut-based analysis. For the \(b\bar{b}\to\mu\mu X\) background in the left column the efficiencies are given separately for each cut, whilst in the right column the combined efficiency is given for the cuts on the pointing angle and on the transverse decay length. As one can see the total rejection is largely overestimated if all cuts are treated separately, so the combined value is used to estimate a total yield of background events. The contribution from \(B_{s}^{0}\to K^{-}\mu\nu\) and \(B_{s}^{0}\to K^{-}\pi^{+}\) is found to be negligible comparing to the combinatorial background contribution. The errors quoted for the efficiencies are statistical only, so they represent only the size of the available Monte Carlo sample, but not the expected accuracy of the experiment where the initial number of background events will be much higher. More details on uncertainties will be given in Section 5.

Figure 8 shows the dimuon mass distribution for signal and background events after all selection cuts have been applied. For the combinatorial background, the contribution for the left and right side of the signal region is estimated in the same way as for the signal region (Table 5).

## 5 Systematic uncertainties

There are several sources of uncertainty in this analysis. Some of them are relevant only for the Monte Carlo study, whilst others should be taken into account with the real data analysis as well.

In this presented analysis, the expected number of signal and background events is estimated by counting directly instead of the normalisation procedure described in Section 3, which is supposed to be used in a real experiment. Consequently the dimuon trigger and reconstruction efficiencies, and acceptance, are not canceled by those from the reference channel and must explicitly be taken into account. Using the methods developed by ATLAS [12] this systematic uncertainly is estimated to be of about few percent.

There is a theoretical uncertainty of a factor of two in the b-production cross-section at LHC energies, which clearly affects the Monte Carlo predictions. Consequently all numbers of events from Table 5 scale

Figure 6: Distribution of pointing angle \(\alpha\) for the reconstructed \(B_{s}^{0}\) candidates. The signal is shown as closed circles, background as opened circles. Distributions is normalised to 1. The vertical line indicates the highest values of \(\alpha\) allowed for selected events.

The number of events has been scaled to 10 fb\({}^{-1}\) of integrated luminosity.

accordingly.

The difference between the real and simulated kinematic properties of detected particles (e.g., due to not fully accounting for misalignment or material effects) can also introduce a bias in our predictions. However Figure 2 shows that the most of muons from \(B_{s}^{0}\to\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\) have a \(p_{T}\) in the region of the efficiency plateau so the possible deformation of \(p_{T}\) (as well as \(\eta\)) spectra could change the resulting efficiency by not more than a few percent. The uncertainty from the cuts factorisation hypothesis is assumed to be approximately 50%.

Some uncertainties will, to a large extent, cancel if we use a normalisation channel \(B^{+}\to J/\psi K^{+}\) to estimate the \({\cal B}(B_{s}^{0}\to\mu^{+}\mu^{-})\) as the dimuon trigger conditions are similar for both channels. Without experimental data, it is difficult to estimate the uncertainty in the number of background events in a given mass range. In the D0 analysis [17], the sideband extrapolation method is estimated to give an uncertainly of 20-30%. Indeed, this is the main source of uncertainty in the D0 analysis of \(B_{s}^{0}\to\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\). Corrections should also be made for the contribution of \(B_{d}^{0}\to\mu\mu\) decay in the experimental sample.

In total, the uncertainty from the systematic errors discussed in this Section is approximately \(\pm 25\%\). In addition, the procedure adopted to estimate backgrounds via cut factorisation has large uncertainties, which are estimated to be of the order of 50%, as discussed above. In addition, a 70% uncertainty arises from Monte Carlo statistics. Overall, we choose to combine these in quadrature to obtain an indicative overall uncertainty on the background of +90%/-75%.

## 6 Start-up strategy

Already at 1 fb\({}^{-1}\)of integrated luminosity, ATLAS can have \(O(10^{6})\) of dimuon events in a mass window \(4\) GeV \(<M(\mu\mu)<7\) GeV (after vertexing and quality cuts). It will allow tuning of the selection procedure either for the cut-based analysis or for the multivariate methods for the background discrimination. Events that survive background suppression will be used to estimate the background contribution to the

The signal is shown as histogram, combinatorial background by closed circles and non-combinatorial backgrounds by opened circles and triangles. The combinatorial background is estimated assuming a factorisation of applied cuts. Statistics are given for an integrated luminosity 10 fb\({}^{-1}\).

signal search region. The contribution from combinatorial background will be estimated using the side-bands interpolation procedure. The contribution from exclusive backgrounds due to fake dimuons from hadronic two-body \(B\) decays or from \(B_{s}^{0}\to K^{-}\mu^{+}\nu\), will be determined on the basis of the study of the hadron/muon misidentification probability. The background estimation will be compared with the number of events observed in the signal region. Following this information an upper limit on the number of signal events \(N_{B}\) corresponding to certain confidence level will be determined, using appropriate statistical methods. Finally, the value of \(N_{B}\) will be used to extract the upper limit on the \(B_{s}^{0}\to\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\) branching fraction, \({\cal B}(B_{s}^{0}\to\mu^{+}\mu^{-})\), using a reference channel \(B^{+}\to J/\psi K^{+}\). In this procedure a ratio of geometric and kinematical acceptances of the signal and the reference channels will be determined from the Monte Carlo simulation. Trigger and offline reconstruction efficiencies largely cancel for dimuons in these channels. The reference channel \(B^{+}\to J/\psi K^{+}\) will also be used to check the Monte Carlo simulation. The efficiency of the final selection cuts on discriminating variables for the signal \(B_{s}^{0}\to\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\) will be determined using Monte Carlo simulation (validated with the reference channel).

## 7 Conclusions

We have presented the strategy for searching for the rare decay \(B_{s}^{0}\to\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\) with the ATLAS detector. Whilst we do not expect to observe this decay during the early stages of the LHC, as more luminosity becomes available and our understanding of the backgrounds improves, it should be possible to identify a signal for the process. There are uncertainties due to the relatively unknown beauty production cross-section at the LHC, and also the limited Monte Carlo statistics available for this study. Within these limitations, assuming the Standard Model, we expect a signal of 5.7 events with a background of \(14\,^{+13}_{-10}\) events for an integrated luminosity of 10 fb\({}^{-1}\). It is evident that the background uncertainties are large in this study. However, background estimates based on real data will be able to make use of much higher statistics and these will provide reduced uncertainties, as well as allowing the evaluation of more sophisticated methods of analysis.
