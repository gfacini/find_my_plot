**Variation of Momentum Resolution with Beam-Spot Size**

**Stephen Haywood - RAL**

## 1 Cross-checks between different Programs

Results are frequently shown from several programs and often they appear to be different. However, it seems that the differences can be explained by a) different input parameters (resolutions and positions) or b) treatment of the TRT.

**DICE**: Official s/w - the most realistic simulation. Input: detector pitches;1 coordinate generation is as for real detector. \(p_{t}\) resolution is determined from the distribution of \(1/p_{t}(recon)-1/p_{t}(true)\).
**TRACKERR**: Program from Innes, used by Adrian Fox-Murphy.2 Input: resolution at planes. Includes multiple-scattering. \(p_{t}\) resolution is explicitly calculated.
**TRAKER**: My own simulation, intended to study parameter resolutions and pattern recognition. Input: resolution on planes. \(p_{t}\) resolution is explicitly calculated, and as a cross-check, the pull in \(1/p_{t}\) is found to have unit width.
**BARREL**: My very simple program for determining momentum resolution in barrel by evaluating errors corresponding to a parabolic fit. \(p_{t}\) resolution is explicitly calculated.

Footnote 1: Resolution is implicitly obtained from \(pitch/\sqrt{12}\).

Footnote 2: See INDET-043.

1. BARREL always agrees with TRAKER.
2. BARREL agreed with TRACKERR for test cases.

3. BARREL agreed with DICE for a configuration corresponding to the Panel layout:

With pitches of 50, 50, 70, 100, 100 and 100 \(\mu\) m at radii of 11.5, 20, 30, 40, 50 and 60 cm respectively, no TRT and a beam-spot of 15 \(\mu\) m (not 20 \(\mu\) m) DICE obtains \(\sigma(1/p_{t})\) of \(0.65\times 10^{-3}\) GeV\({}^{-1}\). Taking the resolution as \(pitch/\sqrt{12}\), BARREL gives \(0.72\times 10^{-3}\) GeV\({}^{-1}\). However, DICE correctly incorporates overlaps of wafers, and this introduces 16% extra hits. If the point resolutions used in BARREL are reduced by \(\sqrt{2}\) with a probability of 16%, then the result is \(0.67\times 10^{-3}\) GeV\({}^{-1}\) - in agreement with DICE.

This gives us some confidence in the various programs in use, at least as far as the handling of the precision layers in the barrel is concerned. (I believe Alan Poppleton made similar comparisons in the past.)

There is a potential source of ambiguity associated with the parameters of the beam-spot. The distribution of the collision point inside the beam-envelope is the product of the beam-profile distributions of the two beams. The Gaussian widths of the two distributions differ by \(\sqrt{2}\). The parameter used by DICE corresponds to the collision point - it is as if there were a detector at the interaction point measuring with a resolution of 15 \(\mu\) m.

The **TRT** is more difficult to handle than the precision layers because there are many layers and the systematics are difficult to incorporate. Results presented from TRACKERR do not include systematics (although they can be incorporated to some extent by inflating the statistical error on the straw measurements), and therefore tend to be too optimistic. Likewise, care has to be taken with DICE. My programs are aimed at studying the precision layers, and therefore represent the TRT as a single equivalent measurement - clearly an over simplification. A realistic treatment of the TRT is particularly important for the Panel layout, since it relies heavily on the TRT to provide a high radius \(\phi\) measurement.

## 2 Variation of \(\sigma(1/p_{t})\) with beam-spot size

Using TRAKER, I have determined \(\sigma(1/p_{t})\) with beam-constrained fits as a function of \(\eta\) for **different beam-spot sizes** (5, 10, 15 and 20 \(\mu\) m). The variation corresponds to what might be seen as a function of luminosity (and hence years of running). I have turned off smearing of the vertex in \(z\).

The **intrinsic resolution of the TRT**3 with low occupancy is of the order of 180 \(\mu\)m per straw divided by \(\sqrt{40}\) straws, ie. about 30 \(\mu\) m. With the higher occupancies at larger luminosities, this may increase to 50 \(\mu\)m. The expected systematic is of the order of 30 \(\mu\)m resulting in effective point resolutions of 40 to 60 \(\mu\)m. The effective radii of this point are taken as 85 and 90 cm for the Cosener's House and Panel layouts respectively. At large \(\eta\), I model the TRT as a disk extending to \(|\eta|=2.3\).

Footnote 3: The numbers used here were suggested to me by Daniel Froidevaux. They are used for illustration and should not be taken as definitive.

The resolutions used in the barrel for the Panel layout correspond to the pitches given above, namely 15, 15, 20, 30, 30 and 30 \(\mu\) m. In the endcaps, \(r\phi\) resolutions for the superlayers of 15, 25 and 40 \(\mu\)m for inner GaAs, outer GaAs and MSGC's have been used. For the Cosener's layout, I used resolutions of 15, 60, 15, 15, 30, 30 and 30 \(\mu\)m for the barrels at 11.5, 14.5, 20, 30, 53, 81, 105 cm respectively and 15 and 40 \(\mu\)m for GaAs and MSGC's. (The 30 \(\mu\)m resolution of the outer Silicon which I used is better than given in status report of March 1993, and arguably too good and too expensive.)

The \(1/p_{t}\) resolution as a function of \(\eta\) for the Panel layout with 60 \(\mu\)m effective resolution in the TRT is shown in figure 1 for different beam-spot sizes. Numbers are given in table 1. In figure 2, comparison is made between TRT resolutions of 60 \(\mu\) m and 40 \(\mu\)m, and between the Panel and Cosener's layout.

l stress that this work does not seriously aim at comparing the Panel and Cosener's layout, since the resolutions which can be achieved depend critically on the choice of pitches for different layers.

Several clarifications are needed for the figures:

1. The resolution in the Panel layout appears to be constant in the region \(0<|\eta|<2.5\) unlike results from TRACKERR, because in the Panel layout, the TRT dominates the resolution and in TRAKER, I have not attempted to simulate the crack in the TRT, which is better described by TRACKERR.
2. The structure of the MSGC disks in the Cosener's layout can be explicitly seen in the region \(1.0<|\eta|<1.9\). They are not apparent in the Panel layout because the TRT dominates.
3. The big dip around \(|\eta|=1.9\) in the Panel layout comes from the excellent resolution obtained from the big MSGC disks at the end of the detector. This dip is enhanced by the naivety of my TRT model and the systematically reduced TRT resolution. Since the big MSGC disks dominate, the Panel and Cosener's layout give similar resolutions at large \(|\eta|\) and the big disks overwhelm any differences from the TRT resolution.
4. In the Cosener's layout, there is no improvement in reducing the TRT resolution from 60 \(\mu\)m to 40 \(\mu\)m, because the high radius points (30 \(\mu\)m Si in the barrel and outer MSGC's in the endcap) dominate the TRT measurements.

Finally, I was reminded that owing to the finite length of the coil, the magnetic field falls by about 24% at the largest \(z\), causing the momentum resolution to fall by about 12%. Obviously, these numbers depend on the precise geometry of the coil, and it will be important to have a good field map to avoid additional systematic errors.

## Conclusions

Most calculations of momentum resolution have been made with beam-spot sizes of the order of 15 \(\mu\)m. However, at low luminosities, we may benefit from sizes as low as 5 \(\mu\)m; in which case the momentum resolution in the barrel is improved by about 20% when using the beam-constraint.
