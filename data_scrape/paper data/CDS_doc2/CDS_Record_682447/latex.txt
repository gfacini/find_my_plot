ABSTRACT

A study on the absolute energy calibration of the hadron calorimeters is presented. The basic idea is the use of a physics process, namely Drell-Yan production of tau pairs with the subsequent decay of the tau into a single hadron and a tau-neutrino. The energy of the two charged hadrons can be measured in the calorimeters. Together with the momentum measurement from the tracking detectors the ratio E/p can then be used to get the absolute energy calibration. The enormous rate from background processes mainly coming from QCD jet production faking the signal of two charged, isolated hadrons with opposite sign can be handled to a negligible level by using appropriate kinematical cuts. These cut variables could also serve to separate other physics channels from background such as the Standard Model \(H^{0}\to\tau^{+}\tau^{-}\) or the supersymmetric \(A^{0}\to\tau^{+}\tau^{-}\).

**1. Introduction**

For an accurate measurement of the energy of jets such as in e.g. the precise measurement of the top-quark mass, there is a need to calibrate the absolute energy scale of the ATLAS hadron calorimeters to the percent level [1].

The suggestion of "Yesterdays discoveries will serve today for calibration and will be tomorrows background processes" and the possibility to use real data such as electrons from the various physics channels to calibrate the Liquid Argon electromagnetic calorimeters (LAr) in situ [2], have been the motivations to search for a physics process which could serve to calibrate also the absolute energy scale of the ATLAS **hadron** calorimeters in situ.

Isolated electrons from Z or W decays or from b decays as in the case of the calibration of the LAr electromagnetic calorimeter cannot be used, because electrons do not penetrate into the hadronic parts of the calorimeters. Isolated muons from Z or W decays could in principle be used. But, because the correlation between the muon energy and its energy loss seen in the hadronic calorimeters is very weak, it

calorimeters. But without specification of a dedicated reaction it might be difficult to ensure the signature of a single, isolated hadron which is not accompanied by one ore more \(\pi^{0}\)'s.

To control its short term stability and performance the hadronic tile calorimeter will be relatively calibrated with photodiode signals from a laser system [5] and with a cesium source (\({}^{187}Cs\)) [6]. The long term behaviour will be controlled by using two complementary methods: one, is the use of minimum bias events to equalize the currents of the photomultipliers (PMs) in each cell and second, is the use of the \({}^{187}Cs\) source to measure the current.

The absolute energy scale calibration will be performed with pions, muons and electrons at various energies in test beams. At least one out of eight modules will be exposed. Because it will be impossible to calibrate all 3300 modules in test beam, the \({}^{187}Cs\) source will be used to give the correlation between the PM signals and the energies for all modules.

We propose to use the physics process of reaction (1) to get the absolute energy scale calibrated to the desired precision. Single isolated charged hadrons give a unique possibility to transport the energy scale as obtained in test beams from pions directly onto the detector in situ. The selection of Drell-Yan production of tau pairs with their hadronic decay mode will give the signal events. The application of appropriate kinematical cuts may allow the reduction of concurrent background processes to a negligible level, as will be shown below. Once this calibration procedure is well established, Monte Carlo (MC) calculations can be used to simulate as close as possible the pion response of the calorimeters. If confidence in the MC procedure is obtained, MC simulations of QCD jets could also be used for the absolute calibration of the calorimeters of jets, with the limitations of the validity of fragmentation models in mind.

The advantages to use reaction (1) to calibrate the absolute energy scale of the hadron calorimeters are manifold:

* The energy scale as obtained from test beam measurements is directly transportable to the calorimeters.
* All the different calorimeters traversed by the charged hadrons in radial direction, such as the preshower detector (PS), the electromagnetic (EM) and the hadronic (HAD) calorimeters can be calibrated together. The calibration can be performed for the barrel HAD in the central region as well as for the extended barrel in the forward region, and also for the LAr calorimeter in the forward regions.
* The individual weighting factors, \(K_{PS}\), \(K_{EM}\), \(K_{HAD}\), can be determined for each part, and also the global weighting factor, \(K_{GLOBAL}\), and/or they can be checked, if already known from test beams.
* The proposed physics process allows the absolute energy calibration on a cell-to-cell basis over the pseudo-rapidity coverage of \(|\eta|<2.5\) without losing too much statistics.

* The proposed physics process allows the absolute energy calibration over a vast energy range. It is up to \(\sim 500\) GeV in the forward regions, and is limited in the central region to energies \(E<70\) GeV due to kinematics. The lower energy range will be constraint by the trigger threshold.
* The proposed physics process gives kinematical constraints which can be used for triggering and strong background rejection.
* The proposed physics process should also allow the absolute energy calibration at the highest possible luminosities if triggering can be ensured.

The method suggested is as follows:

* The momentum p of each of the two charged hadrons will be accurately measured using the tracking detectors.
* The energy E of each of the two charged hadrons will be measured in the calorimeters (PS, EM and HAD) with good precision.
* To get the absolute energy calibration the ratio E/p can be used. This ratio should be very close to one if the energy and the momentum of the particles (isolated charged hadrons) are correctly measured. It can be used to adjust the energy calibration in cases where the constraint \(E/p\sim 1\) is not fulfilled.

To separate the reaction \(pp\to\gamma^{*},Z0\to\tau^{+}\tau^{-}\), with the subsequent decay of the taus into a pair of a single hadron and a tau-neutrino, from the background will not be an easy task. Usually the background, mainly coming from QCD jet production faking the signal of two isolated hadrons with opposite charge, is many orders of magnitude above the desired signal. In addition, there are neutrinos produced in the reaction giving rise to missing energy. And, because there are two neutrinos involved, the \(Z^{0}\)-mass cannot be fully reconstructed and used efficiently as a cut-parameter as it can be done in the case of \(Z^{0}\to e^{+}e^{-}\) for calibration of the LAr electromagnetic calorimeters. We do not consider methods as proposed in Ref. [8], because in this case \(Z^{0}\)'s with preferentially high transverse momenta, which are produced by associated jet production, would be selected, which is in contrast to the selection method proposed here.

The physics process \(t\to Wb\) with the subsequent decay of the W into a \(q\bar{q}\) pair can be used to determine the absolute energy scale of jets. This process has been studied in ATLAS to some extend. Another possibility is the production of a single photon with a back to back jet to get the jet energy scale, which also could be studied.

How the proposed physics process of reaction (1) can be separated from the background will be discussed in the next section.

## 3 Description of the Signal and Background Simulation

A detailed study of the signal reaction (1) and the background has been performed using PYTHIA 5.7 and JETSET 7.4 [8] as event generator.

To study the mimicry of two hard, charged, isolated hadrons, only the process

\[pp\to b\bar{b}+X \tag{2}\]

has been looked at so far.

The production of

\[pp\to\bar{u}+X \tag{3}\]

with the subsequent decay of the top-quark into \(t\to Wb\) and the W decaying into a \(\tau\nu_{\tau}\) pair and the tau decaying into \(\tau\to h\nu_{\tau}\) has been ignored. Because of the branching fractions involved its contribution is well below the cross section of reaction (1) also after cuts.

Background simulations to take into account QCD jet production from valence quarks or gluons

\[pp\to jet\,jet+X, \tag{4}\]

which have much larger cross sections than \(b\bar{b}\) production and might fake the signal of two isolated single charged hadrons, are under study.

Other physics processes originating from Drell-Yan production such as the production of \(e^{+}e^{-}\), \(\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\) pairs need to be considered as well. These processes will be easily eliminated because these events do not leave a sizable signal in the hadron calorimeters.

A more serious background problem might come from the other decay modes of the tau itself, such as

\[\tau^{\pm}\to\pi^{\pm}\pi^{+}\pi^{-}\nu_{\tau} \tag{5}\]

and

\[\tau^{\pm}\to h^{\pm}\pi^{0}\nu_{\tau} \tag{6}\]

including

\[\tau^{\pm}\to \rho^{\pm}\nu_{\tau}\] \[\quad\quad\mid_{\to}\pi^{\pm}\pi^{0}\]

Because the branching fractions of reaction (5) and (6) are much higher than the one of reaction (1), these decay modes might be potentially dangerous. In particular, because of the accompanying \(\pi^{0}\)('s), it might be difficult to distinguish between a miscalibration of the calorimeters and the additional energy deposition. Nevertheless, there might be good handles because these decay modes are three body decays or two subsequent two body decays. Therefore the correlation between several kinematical variables which are described in section 3.2 might be powerful enough to reduce also this background. A detailed study is also under way in this case.

### Simulated Data Samples

To study reactions (1) and (2) 50 000 Drell-Yan and 2 000 000 \(b\bar{b}\) events have been generated. The corresponding cross sections are given in Table 1.

The analysis presented in this note has been performed on particle level. The detector performance on the measurements of each particle momentum in the tracking volume and of its energy in the different calorimeters has been taken into account by using appropriate smearing functions with Gaussian shape. To each charged particle a momentum smearing function as given in relation (7)

\[\Delta p_{T}/p_{T}=A(\eta)\cdot p_{T}/500\oplus 1.5\% \tag{7}\]

has been applied, where \(A(\eta)\) is a constant depending on the rapidity region, varying from 25% to 80% over the \(\eta\) range. An energy smearing function has been applied to electrons and photons as given in relation (8)

\[\sigma_{B}/E=10.7\%/\sqrt{E}\oplus 0.51/E\oplus 0.7\% \tag{8}\]

and to hadrons as given in relation (9)

\[\sigma_{B}/E=47.0\%/\sqrt{E}\oplus 2.2\%. \tag{9}\]

The final calorimeter perfomances are expected be better, therefore these smearing functions are conservative. A full detector simulation within the SLUG/GEANT and DICE framework [9] is under way.

As a first cut a threshold on the transverse energy, \(E_{T}\), of 5 GeV for at least one particle in the event is applied. This cut reduces the background by a factor of \(\sim 5\) and leaves more than 70% of the signal. Further reduction of the background by another factor of 4 can be obtained by requiring two clusters with \(E_{T}>5\) GeV and an angular separation between them of at least 50\({}^{\circ}\), whereas about 50% of the signal is kept. A total reduction factor of 82 for the background is obtained by an additional requirement on the scalar sum of the two clusters, \(E_{T}^{1}+E_{T}^{2}>20\) GeV, whereas 31% of the total signal is kept, as can be seen from Fig. 1a and 1b where this quantity is shown for the signal and the background events, respectively.

A summary of the different cuts applied is shown in Table 1.

Further reduction of the background while keeping a large fraction of the signal can be obtained by using appropriate kinematical cuts. The definitions of the different cut variables are given in the next section.

### Definition of special kinematical cut variables

To reduce further the QCD jet background we define the following special kinematical variables which make use of the correlation between the charged and the neutral particle systems for the signal reaction.

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:7]

and its transverse energy, \(E_{T}^{\nu^{\prime}s}\), as the scalar sum as given in relation (13)

\[E_{T}^{\nu^{\prime}s}=\sum E_{T}^{vis}. \tag{13}\]

For Drell-Yan production of tau pairs with the subsequent decay of the tau into a single hadron and a tau neutrino the event should only show two charged particles and nothing else in the detector. In this case, beside detector resolution effects, the energy and the momentum of the neutrino system should be perfectly balanced by the energy and momentum sum of the two charged particles. Therefore, the relations

\[p_{T}^{\nu^{\prime}s}\simeq p_{T}^{\nu^{\prime}s}\]

and

\[E_{T}^{\pi^{\prime}s}\simeq E_{T}^{\nu^{\prime}s}\]

should hold for the signal events. In combining relation (10) with relation (12) and relation (11) with relation (13) the following cut variables can be defined

\[DIFF-P=p_{T}^{\pi^{\prime}s}-p_{T}^{\nu^{\prime}s} \tag{14}\]

and

\[DIFF-E=E_{T}^{\pi^{\prime}s}-E_{T}^{\nu^{\prime}s}. \tag{15}\]

Because of the correlation mentioned DIFF-P and DIFF-E are expected to be very close to zero for the signal events. For QCD jet production the vector and, in particular, the scalar sum of the visible energy are in general not balanced by the vector and the scalar sum of two charged particles.

The threshold on the visible transverse energy, which needs adjustment, is important to reduce the contribution from the underlying event and the superposition of several minimum bias events in case of high luminosity.

The correlation between the vector sum \(P_{T}\) of the charged and neutral particle systems are shown in Fig. 2a and 2b for the signal and the background respectively and the correlation between the scalar sum \(E_{T}\) in Fig. 2c and 2d. Note that relation (15) is also an implicit isolation cut variable.

For reaction (1) we have checked with the MC, how well the neutrino momentum and its energy can be determined by adding all the visible energy in the detector (measured). We have compared the exact vector and scalar sum of the neutrino system at generation to the measured ones. As an example for the possible uncertainty by using only all visible energy in the range of \(|\eta|<2.5\) for all particles with \(E_{T}^{vis}>1\) GeV in the transverse plane, Fig. 3a shows the generated vector sum of the two neutrinos as a function of the measured vector sum. Fig. 3b shows the distribution of the difference, \(\Delta p_{T}^{\nu^{\prime}s}\), of the generated and the measured vector sum of the two neutrinos. The width of the \(\Delta p_{T}^{\nu^{\prime}s}\) distribution is \(\sim 3.0\) GeV (RMS) which is reduced to \(\sim 1.4\) GeV (sigma) by applying a Gaussian fit. This results indicatesFigure 2: Vector sum of the neutral particle system versus the charged particle system for (a) signal and (b) background events; scalar sum of the neutral particle system versus the charged particle system for (c) signal and (d) background events

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:10]

follows: there should be no charged particle reconstructed in the tracking detectors with transverse momentum of \(p_{T}>2.5\) GeV/c in a cone with

\[\Delta R=\sqrt{\Delta\phi^{2}+\Delta\eta^{2}}<0.3. \tag{19}\]

Another kinematical variable which makes use of the angular correlation between the charged and neutral particle systems, is the total transverse mass, \(m_{T}^{\pi\rm{total}}\). It is defined below:

\[m_{T}^{\pi\rm{total}}=\sqrt{2\cdot E_{T}^{\pi^{\prime}*}\cdot E_{T}^{\pi^{ \prime}*}-2\cdot p_{T}^{\pi^{\prime}*}\cdot p_{T}^{\nu^{\prime}*}\cdot cos\phi_ {\pi,\nu}} \tag{20}\]

where \(cos\phi_{\pi,\nu}\) is given by the angle between the charged particle and the neutrino systems in the transverse plane.

## 4 Results

To reduce the background by a substantial factor the cut variables defined in the previous section have been applied one by one. A summary of all cuts are listed in Table 1.

Fig. 4a and 4b show the variable DIFF-E for the signal and the background events, respectively. This variable is expected to be close to zero for the signal events, while in general it should not be the case for the background events. Requiring that \(|\)\(DIFF-E\)\(|<20\) GeV reduces the background by an additional factor of 15, while 88% of the signal is kept.

Fig. 5a and 5b show relation (17), \(m_{T}^{\nu^{\prime}*}\), as a function of relation (16), \(m_{T}^{\pi^{\prime}*}\), for the signal and the background events, respectively. The strong correlation between \(m_{T}^{\pi^{\prime}*}\) and \(m_{T}^{\nu^{\prime}*}\) for the signal events is clearly visible.

Fig. 6a and 6b show relation (18), the cut variable DIFF-MT, for the signal and the background events. As expected, the difference in the transverse masses is large for the QCD jet background and is very close to zero for the signal events. Requiring that \(|\,DIFF-MT|<10\) GeV reduces the background by another factor of 9, while 89% of the signal is kept.

The isolation criteria as described in the previous section reduce the background further by a factor of 1.8, while 95% of the signal is kept.

Relation (14), DIFF-P, is shown in Fig. 7a and 7b for the signal and the background events, respectively. Requiring that \(|\,DIFF-P|<2\) GeV/c reduces the background by another factor of 2.9, while 89% of the signal is kept.

The total transverse mass \(m_{T}^{Total}\) after the DIFF-P cut is shown in Fig. 8a and 8b for the signal and the background events, respectively. Requiring that \(m_{T}^{Total}>40\) GeV/c\({}^{2}\) reduces the background by another factor of 3 while 89% of the signal is kept.

After all kinematical cuts have been applied, a total background reduction factor of \(\sim 2.2\cdot 10^{8}\) has been obtained, while more than 18% of the signal is kept. In conclusion, a cross section for background from \(b\overline{b}\) events of \(\sigma_{b\overline{b}}=0.22\cdot 10^{-7}\) mb is retained, which is a factor of 33 below the signal.

Finally, the ratio E/p is shown for the signal events in Fig. 9 after all cuts. Because there has been no artificial miscalibration generated yet, the ratio is well centered at zero. The width of the distribution is rather small, only \(\sigma_{B/p}=(7.8\pm 0.1)\%\), despite the fact that detector resolution effects have been taken into account.

## 5 How to trigger on two isolated charged hadrons

Because of the overwhelming QCD background it might be difficult to find a good trigger condition for the signal events. How to trigger on single isolated charged hadrons needs to be studied in detail. As a proposal it can be searched for two narrow clusters with a transverse energy deposition above a threshold which needs to be defined. Probably for efficient background reduction it will be necessary to raise this threshold much higher than 5 GeV. The two clusters are expected to be back to back in azimuth, therefore the angular separation in the transverse plane should be close to 180\({}^{\circ}\). The additional requirement, that the scalar sum of the transverse energy of the two clusters exceeds a threshold above 20 GeV should reduce the QCD background by a large factor. The exact value if this threshold should be correlated to the \(E_{T}\)-threshold of each hadron pair. If in addition a cut could be applied on the difference of the scalar sum of the transverse energy of the two clusters and of the scalar sum of all visible energy in the calorimeters for all cells above a threshold of 1 GeV (needs adjustment) with \(\eta<2.5\), the trigger rate at level 1 (LVL 1) could be reduced to an acceptable level. A simulation of these cuts for the LVL 1 trigger is under study.

## 6 Conclusions and future work

Using the physics process of Drell-Yan production of tau pairs with the subse

Figure 9: Ratio E/p for single hadronsquent decay of the tau into a single isolated hadron and a tau-neutrino

\[pp\to\gamma^{*},Z^{0}+X\to\tau^{+}\tau^{-}+X\to h^{+}p_{\tau}h^{-}\nu_{\tau}+X,\]

it seems feasible to get an absolute energy calibration of the hadron calorimeters on a cell-to-cell basis by using the constraint \(\mathrm{E/p}\sim 1\). It has been shown, at least on particle level, that the background from \(b\overline{b}\) events can be reduced to a negligible level.

For the study decribed above the cross section obtained after all cuts and taking into account detector resolution effects and a pessimistic track reconstruction efficiency of 0.9 per track is \(\sigma\sim 6.1\cdot 10^{-7}\) mb for the signal events. At low luminosity of \(\mathrm{L}=10^{33}cm^{-2}s^{-1}\) this cross section gives an expected event rate of

\[dN/dt=0.61\ Hz\]

corresponding to

\[dN/dt=52\ 628\ events/day\]

or

\[dN/dt=368\ 396\ events/week.\]

For all 3300 calorimeter cells this event rate would give 223 hadrons per cell per week, which would allow for an accuracy on the absolute energy scale of

\[\sigma_{B}\leq 0.9\%.\]

This uncertainty reflects the statistical error only.

Using higher statistics the method will allow to determine the individual weighting factors \(K_{PS}\), \(K_{BM}\), \(K_{HAD}\) and will also allow the study of the systematic uncertainties.

Please note that the kinematical variables \(p_{T}^{\pi^{\prime}*}\), \(E_{T}^{\pi^{\prime}*}\), \(p_{T}^{\pi^{\prime}*}\), \(E_{T}^{\nu^{\prime}*}\), DIFF-E, DIFF-P, \(m_{T}^{\pi^{\prime}*}\), \(m_{T}^{\pi^{\prime}*}\) and DIFF-M as defined in Section 3.2 could also be a powerful tool to reduce the background for the physics process \(H^{0}\to\tau^{+}\tau^{-}\) and \(A^{0}\to\tau^{+}\tau^{-}\) and should therefore be tried.

Please also note that the method of calibration of the absolute energy scale on a cell-to-cell basis using the \(\mathrm{E/p}\) constraint for single isolated hadrons from Drell-Yan production of tau pairs and the background reduction by using the proposed kinematical variables should be tried out by running experiments. In fact, CDF with its actual statistics of 80 \(pb^{-1}\) or more should have already on the order of 200 events of this mode of \(\tau\) decays on tape (the actual number will depend on the cuts applied and on the efficiencies obtained).

Despite these promissing results, a subtantial work still needs to be done. How to trigger on two isolated charged hadrons needs to be studied in detail. This question needs to be solved rather soon, because if possible, this type of trigger would include for free the trigger for the \(H^{0}\to\tau^{+}\tau^{-}\to h^{+}+h^{-}+\nu^{\prime}s\ (+\pi^{0})\) and \(A^{0}\to\tau^{+}\tau^{-}\to h^{+}+h^{-}+\nu^{\prime}s\ (+\pi^{0})\), which is actually not foreseen in ATLAS.

Checks on all the background contributions need to be performed. And finally, the full simulation program should be used to establish the signal over background ratio. The weighting factors for the different parts of the calorimeters can only be determined in this way.
