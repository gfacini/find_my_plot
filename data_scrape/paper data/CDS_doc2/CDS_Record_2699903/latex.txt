# Measurement of radiation damage through leakage current monitoring of the ATLAS Pixel Detector

The ATLAS Collaboration

###### Abstract

Radiation damage incurred by the silicon modules in the ATLAS Pixel Detector \(B\)-Layer, Layer-1, Layer-2, and disks from the beginning of 2011 through November 2018 has been monitored through measurement of the leakage current. The measurement makes use of the fact that increase of leakage current is proportional to the received fluence. The data are acquired with two leakage current monitoring systems for confirmation. Also reported are predictions made with the Hamburg Model which are scaled to match the average magnitude of the leakage current data. Comparisons of fluence predictions by Pythia8 + FLUKA to the fluence determined from leakage current data combined with the Hamburg Model are made for each barrel layer and disk. Finally, projections of the lifetime of the Pixel Detector \(B\)-Layer are made using several scenarios for the expected sensor temperatures and fluence rates, by extrapolating from the leakage current data and the Hamburg Model predictions, through 2023 and 431 \(\rm{fb^{-1}}\) of collected luminosity.

## 1 Introduction

The radiation field in which the ATLAS silicon pixel detectors [1] will be immersed during Run 3 of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and on into the High Luminosity-LHC (HL-LHC) era will reach unprecedented levels for a full scale detector. Measurement of the radiation damage is needed to ensure their safe operation; measurement of the leakage current in the silicon sensors provides access to this. Measurements of leakage current during the present era can be used to optimize the operating conditions in the future. Leakage current in ATLAS Pixel Detector silicon modules from February 2011 of LHC Run 1 through the end of LHC Run 2 in November 2018 is measured and compared to predictions made with the Hamburg Model [2; 3] and fluence simulations created with the FLUKA framework [4].

A linear relationship between particle fluence and leakage current applies to silicon sensors. The effective fluence, \(\Phi_{\mathrm{eq}}\), is the number of 1 MeV neutrons applied to a sensor of surface area 1 cm\({}^{2}\) that cause damage equivalent to that of all particles that went through the sensor. The linear relationship between fluence and \(\Delta I\), the difference in leakage current at fluence \(\Phi_{\mathrm{eq}}\) relative to the value before irradiation, is given as

\[\Delta I=\alpha\cdot\Phi_{\mathrm{eq}}\cdot V \tag{1}\]

where \(V\) is the depleted volume of the silicon sensor and \(\alpha\) is the current-related damage coefficient [2]. The leakage current data and predictions are normalized to the same temperature for direct comparison. The normalization is made using the known leakage current dependence on temperature and the effective silicon band gap energy, \(E_{\mathrm{eff}}\)[5]. The goal of this measurement is to use the leakage current data to measure sensor damage resulting from unprecedented radiation fluence and project the lifetime of the detector.

The Pixel Detector is arranged in four barrel layers and 2\(\times\)3 disks surrounding the proton-proton interaction point (see Figure 1); it is the closest ATLAS subsystem to the interaction point. In this study, a representative sample of the modules is selected from the three outermost barrel layers. The Insertable \(B\)-Layer (IBL), illustrated in Figure 1, is not covered in this note. The analysis of the IBL sensors is available in [6]. The three barrel layers used in this study are listed in increasing radius \(r\) from the beam

Figure 1: ATLAS Pixel Detector.

line: the \(B\)-Layer is placed at \(r\) = 50.5 mm, Layer-1 at 88.5 mm, and Layer-2 at 122.5 mm1. All three barrel layers have the same dimensions along the beam line axis, \(z=\pm\) 380 mm, where \(z\) is measured from the interaction point, and they cover the full azimuthal angle, \(\phi\). A representative sample of disk modules is also used in the study. The disks are located at \(z=\pm\)495 mm, \(\pm\)580 mm, and \(\pm\)650 mm and named Disk-1, Disk-2, and Disk-3, respectively. The modules on the disks have an inner radius of 8.88 cm and the outer radius of 14.96 cm. The barrel layers are comprised of 1456 silicon modules, and disks add an additional 288 modules. Each module includes a pixel sensor with an active surface area of 6.08 \(\times\) 1.64 cm\({}^{2}\), fabricated on (252.5 \(\pm\) 2.8) \(\mu\)m thick n-type bulk. The sensor is made by implanting highly doped p-type (p\({}^{+}\)) and highly doped n-type (n\({}^{+}\)) material on opposite surfaces of the bulk. These planar sensors operate with n\({}^{+}\) implants on the read-out side, where the front end electronics read out the signal, and the p-n junction on the back side. Details of the pixel sensor geometry and layout can be found in [1; 7]. The magnitude of the reverse bias voltage applied to the sensor is set based on simulation results and sensor voltage scans; the bias voltage is expected to produce full depletion of the sensors. The modules selected for this analysis sample the full range of \(r\), \(\phi\), and \(z\) of the pixel detector. The positions of the selected modules can be seen in Figures 2 and 3. Some data are not accessible due to power outages and other cases of system unavailability.

Footnote 1: ATLAS uses a right handed coordinate system with its origin at the nominal interaction point (IP) in the center of the detector and the \(z\)-axis along the beam pipe. The x-axis points from the IP to the center of the LHC ring, and the y-axis points upward. Cylindrical coordinates (\(r\), \(\phi\)) are used in the transverse plane, \(\phi\) being the azimuthal angle around the beam pipe. The pseudorapidity is defined in terms of the polar angle \(\theta\) as \(\eta=-\ln\tan(\theta/2)\).

Detailed simulations of particle production (Pythia8) [8] and transport (FLUKA) [9; 10], together with damage factors [11], are used to predict the accumulated fluence. An alternative transport model (provided in Geant4) [12] using the detailed geometry of the ATLAS detector is also investigated. The fluence is measured by performing a fit to the leakage current data: the Hamburg model is used to predict the leakage current evolution with luminosity up to an overall scale factor that is fit to the leakage current data.

A description of the subsystems used to measure the leakage current in the silicon sensors is in Sec. 2. Details of how the measurement was performed are in Sec. 3. Details of the method used to calculate the luminosity for this study are discussed in Sec. 4. The Hamburg Model leakage current predictions and FLUKA simulation fluences are described in Sec. 5. Contributions to the uncertainty on the measurements of leakage current are discussed in Sec. 6, and the results of the study are presented in Sec. 7. A brief

discussion on the sensitivity to the choice of \(E_{\text{eff}}\) is presented in Sec. 8. Sec. 9 presents a comparison of the predicted and measured fluences. A lifetime projection of the \(B\)-Layer is in Sec. 10.

## 2 Measurement Subsystems

Leakage current data are collected using two independent subsystems, the per-module high voltage patch panel subsystem (HVPP4) and the multi-module power supply subsystem used to confirm and augment the HVPP4 measurement. The HVPP4 serves as a fan-out point for the bias voltages delivered to the pixel modules from the Iseg high voltage power supplies [13] and monitors leakage current at the pixel module granularity level by a Current Monitoring Board system. Further details on the HVPP4 system can be found in Ref. [7].

During Run 1, each power supply channel was used to power and read out 6 or 7 modules in parallel. During the long shutdown of the LHC between 2013 and 2015, more power supply units were installed for use in the Pixel Detector. During LHC Run 2, each power supply channel supplied one or two modules. The sum of the leakage current values is measured for the modules supplied by a common power supply unit. The precision of measurements of the leakage current read with the power supply units is improved during LHC Run 2. The raw leakage current data measured by both the HVPP4 system and the power supplies are stored in the COOL database.

## 3 Details of the Measurement

The leakage current data are collected from the COOL database and quality cuts are applied. Leakage current data are excluded for modules during periods when their bias voltage was not applied. The few non-working modules with bias voltage not applied are excluded from the study. Data collected within one minute of high voltage turn-on are also excluded. Analysis of the leakage current data is restricted to times when the LHC has declared the proton beams to be stable. Luminosity recorded outside of these periods is included in this study, see Sec. 4.

Figure 3: The positions of monitored modules in \(\phi\) on the disks on side A (left) and side C (right). The modules on each disk are centered at a radial distance of 119.2 mm.

Leakage current depends on the temperature of the sensor [3]. The following equation converts the leakage current of a sensor measured at temperature \(T\) to that at a reference temperature \(T_{\mathrm{R}}\):

\[I(T_{\mathrm{R}})=I(T)\times R(T), \tag{2}\]

where,

\[R(T)=(T_{\mathrm{R}}/T)^{2}\cdot\exp\left[-\frac{E_{\mathrm{eff}}}{2k_{\mathrm{ B}}}(1/T_{\mathrm{R}}-1/T)\right]. \tag{3}\]

\(E_{\mathrm{eff}}\) is the effective silicon band gap energy after irradiation, also called activation energy, and \(k_{\mathrm{B}}\) is the Boltzmann constant. \(T\) and \(T_{R}\) must be expressed in Kelvin. The value of 1.21 eV has been used for \(E_{\mathrm{eff}}\) following a study on how this value changes under different radiation conditions [5]. This can be compared to the nominal silicon band gap energy of 1.12 eV before irradiation. It is worth noting that the temperature normalization is dependent on the choice of \(E_{\mathrm{eff}}\). A nominal reference temperature \(T_{\mathrm{R}}=0~{}^{\circ}\mathrm{C}\) has been used throughout this study. The temperature of the sensors is held at about -12 \({}^{\circ}\mathrm{C}\) during operation and 18 \({}^{\circ}\mathrm{C}\) during times when the detector is turned off.

The temperature of each monitored module is read from the DCS database. Equation 2 is applied to the leakage current data on a per module basis.

Luminosity data are collected for every luminosity block, corresponding to approximately one minute of data collection. Luminosity is proportional to fluence and is thus chosen for comparison with the leakage current. The temperature-corrected leakage current is sampled once per luminosity block.

Leakage currents are measured for each module individually using the HVPP4 subsystem in LHC Run 1 and Run 2 and for pairs of modules using the power supply subsystem in LHC Run 2. These measurements are subsequently averaged for each barrel layer and each disk. Averaged binned measurements are also examined for \(\phi\) and \(z\) dependence for a more refined investigation of the spatial dependence of the radiation damage.

## 4 Details of Luminosity Accumulation

The luminosity is determined by a set of dedicated bunch-by-bunch luminosity detectors [14] that are calibrated using the van der Meer method [15]. The absolute luminosity used in this study accounts for luminosities accumulated during times when the ATLAS detector is not operating, because all particle fluence received by the silicon sensors will impact the leakage current. Luminosities outside of the LHC stable beams, ATLAS ready, and ATLAS physics declarations are included. The values used for this study surpass the quantities reported as official ATLAS luminosity usable for physics [16]. The total delivered luminosity used throughout this analysis is shown in Figure 4.

## 5 Hamburg Model Predictions

The complex radiation fields in the ATLAS detector are simulated using the particle transport code FLUKA [9, 10]. The Inner Detector and Calorimeter are modeled with high accuracy in the ATLAS FLUKA simulation framework [4]. This is important for modeling high energy hadron cascades in the material that lead to increased particle fluences in the Inner Detector, especially neutrons. Inelastic proton-proton interactions generated by Pythia8[8] using the MSTW2008LO parton distribution functions [17] and the A2 tune [18] are used for input to the FLUKA simulation. The fluence is approximately 70% from protons and charged pions and 20% from neutrons. Particles are transported down to an energy of 100 keV, except for photons (30 keV) and neutrons (thermal).

The dominant radiation damage type is assumed to be displacement defects in the bulk of the pixel sensor, initiated by hadronic species and caused by non-ionizing energy loss (NIEL). A compilation of damage factors due to NIEL can be found in [11]. Surface ionization is neglected in this treatment. Charged pions originating directly from the proton-proton collisions are the largest contributor to the bulk damage for the radii covered by the Pixel Detector. Albedo neutrons originating in the outer ATLAS detectors also contribute. The resulting displacement defects increase the reverse leakage current, degrade the charge collection efficiency, and change the effective doping concentration which directly determines the depletion voltage. Predictions of the 1 MeV neutron-equivalent (\(n_{\rm eq}\)) fluences per cm\({}^{2}\) (\(\Phi_{\rm eq}\)) per fb\({}^{-1}\) in the ATLAS FLUKA Inner Detector geometry are shown in Figure 5.

The values collected in Table 1 represent the highest fluence simulated by FLUKA for each layer and disk. The barrel layer values correspond to the points with z-projection closest to the interaction point (closest to \(z=0\)). The \(z\)-dependence of the fluence, which depends on the distance from the interaction point, is also accounted for in the simulation (see Figures 5 and 21 below). The fluence of charged particles produced at the primary collision goes as \(1/r^{2}\). The fluence of neutrons depends on the detector geometry as these are primarily due to back scattering from the calorimeter. The simulation is used for conversion between luminosity and fluence.

Figure 4: Luminosity accumulated by ATLAS during LHC Run 2.

The fluence \(\Phi_{\rm eq}\) accumulated by the ATLAS Pixel Detector, and measured in units of cm\({}^{-2}\), is expected to be proportional to integrated luminosity \(\int\mathcal{L}dt\), measured in fb\({}^{-1}\). By the end of the proton-proton collision runs in 2018, the \(B\)-Layer was predicted, by Pythia8 + FLUKA, to have received an integrated fluence of \(\Phi_{\rm eq}=5.27\times 10^{14}\) 1 MeV \(n_{\rm eq}/\)cm\({}^{2}\). The \(B\)-Layer was designed to receive a total integrated fluence of \(1\times 10^{15}\) 1 MeV \(n_{\rm eq}/\)cm\({}^{2}\) over the span of its lifetime. The evolution of fluence accumulation over the lifetime of the detectors is shown in Figure 6.

The FLUKA simulated fluence is used as an input to the Hamburg Model [3] to predict the change in leakage current, \(\Delta I_{\rm leak}\), after irradiation:

\[\Delta I=(\Phi_{\rm eq}/L_{\rm int})\times V\cdot\sum_{i=1}^{n}L_{\rm int,i} \cdot\left[\alpha_{1}\exp\left(-\sum_{j=i}^{n}\frac{t_{j}}{\tau(T_{j})}\right) +\alpha_{0}^{*}-\beta\log\left(\sum_{j=i}^{n}\frac{\Theta(T_{j})\cdot t_{j}}{t _{0}}\right)\right]. \tag{4}\]

Here, \(L_{\rm int,i}\) is the integrated luminosity, \(t_{i}\) is the time, and \(T_{i}\) is the temperature in period \(i\). The first sum is over all time periods and the two sums inside the exponential and logarithmic functions are over the time between the irradiation in time period \(i\) and the time of the measurement. The other symbols in Eq. (4) are \(t_{0}=1\) min, \(V=\) depleted volume2 (in cm\({}^{3}\)), \(\alpha_{1}=(1.23\pm 0.06)\times 10^{-17}\) A/cm, \(\tau\) follows an Arrhenius equation \(\tau^{-1}=(1.2_{-1.0}^{+5.3})\times 10^{13}\) s\({}^{-1}\times e^{(-1.11\pm 0.05)/k_{\rm B}T}\) (where the units of \(k_{\rm B}T\) are eV), \(\alpha_{0}^{*}=7.07\cdot 10^{-17}\) A/cm, and \(\beta=(3.29\pm 0.18)\times 10^{-18}\) A/cm. A small temperature dependence has been observed in the value of \(\beta\)[3]; for this analysis, the value at 21\({}^{\circ}\)C is used - its lowest known value and the one closest to the operational temperature of the sensors in the detector. Equation 4 represents the Hamburg Model as presented in [3]; under different conditions different terms will dominate. The temperature scaling function \(\Theta(T)\) is defined by

Footnote 2: Full depletion of the sensors is equal to the volume of the sensor modules, \(V=0.25\) cm\({}^{3}\).

\[\Theta(T)=\exp\left[-\frac{E_{\rm eff}}{k_{\rm B}}\left(\frac{1}{T}-\frac{1}{T _{\rm R}}\right)\right], \tag{5}\]

where, as before, \(E_{\rm eff}=1.21\) eV is used for the effective silicon band gap energy, \(k_{\rm B}\) is the Boltzmann constant, and \(T_{\rm R}=21\)\({}^{\circ}\)C. Once the simulation is complete, a temperature correction to the full simulation is made so that it may be compared to the leakage current data. The simulation is corrected from its initial temperature of 21 \({}^{\circ}\)C to 0 \({}^{\circ}\)C.

The implementation of the Hamburg Model can be found in Ref. [19]; the treatment in this analysis is identical to the treatment in the ATLAS Radiation Modeling paper [6].

The luminosity-to-fluence conversion factor, \(\Phi_{\rm eq}/L_{\rm int}\), in Eq. 4 requires a scale factor to match the leakage current data. The scale factor is determined from the constant fit to the ratio of the leakage current data and the Hamburg Model prediction. Hamburg Model predictions are made in four bins along the \(z\)-axis for each barrel layer (a total of 12 predictions) and for each disk. Each prediction (12 for the barrel layers and 6 for the disks) is fit to the data with a scale factor. For each barrel layer, the average of the scaled predictions associated with the four bins along the \(z\) axis is compared to the average leakage current data in the same four bins.

## 6 Precision and Systematic Uncertainties

This section provides the elements that contribute to the uncertainty of the measurement of the leakage current, the Hamburg Model predictions, and the measurement of the fluence. The final uncertainty is calculated by adding all contributing elements in quadrature. The precision on current measurements made with the HVPP4 current monitoring circuit contributes 12% uncertainty. The precision on current measurements made with the power supply units contributes 4% to the total measurement uncertainty [13]. The current measurements are made approximately once per minute and that interval contributes 0.5% uncertainty; this uncertainty is calculated by investigating the deviations in the data over ten minute intervals - a time interval over which the leakage current is not expected to change. The precision of the temperature measurements contributes 2.9% uncertainty; the temperature is also not expected to fluctuate over short time intervals and is thus calculated in the same way as the current uncertainty. Uncertainties due to possible difference between the temperature of the point on the module at which the temperature is measured, and the point on the silicon sensor to which the temperature is attributed are found to be 10% through changes to the modeled leakage current when a difference in temperature of 1 \({}^{\circ}\)C is applied

through Eq. 2. The total uncertainty on the leakage current data collected with HVP4 is determined by adding in quadrature the HVPP4 current monitoring circuit measurement uncertainty, the current measurement uncertainty, and each of the two temperature uncertainties; the HVPP4 data uncertainty is found to be 15.9%. The total uncertainty on the leakage current data collected with the dual-module power supply units is determined by adding in quadrature the power supply precision uncertainty, the current measurement uncertainty, and each of the two temperature uncertainties; the power supply data uncertainty is found to be 11.2%. The measurement uncertainties are shown in Table 2.

The uncertainty of the predicted leakage current is determined from the uncertainty of the inputs to the model. These are summarized in Table 3. The uncertainty on the scale factor fit is obtained from the constant fit to the ratio of the Hamburg Model prediction to the data. The scale factor fit is determined using the statistical uncertainties of Table 2.

The fluence predicted from the leakage current data and the Hamburg Model is investigated in Sec. 9. The statistical uncertainty on the fluence predictions made by Pythia8 + FLUKA is 1.0%. There are sources of uncertainty introduced to both the Hamburg Model and the predicted fluence through the silicon hardness factors [11] which are not taken into account in this analysis. The hardness factors used here are from the RD50 database [20; 21; 22; 23], but all of these values are without uncertainty and many are based only on simulation. The uncertainty on the fluence extracted from the leakage current data and the Hamburg Model is summarized in Table 4.

Figure 6: Applied fluence for the \(B\)-Layer, Layer-1, Layer-2, and the Disks, calculated by the FLUKA factors shown in Figure 5 and summarized in Table 1. Pythia8 is used for particle production, MSTW2008LO parton distribution functions [17] and the A2 tune [18] are used for input to the FLUKA simulation.

The uncertainty on the luminosity does not contribute to uncertainty on the leakage current data but is included in the fluence measurement. The uncertainty in the combined 2015-2018 integrated luminosity is 2.5%. It is derived, following a method similar to that detailed in Ref. [24], from calibrations of the luminosity scale using x-y beam-separation scans performed in August 2015, May 2016, and July 2017. These scans are equivalent to the van der Meer scans mentioned in Sec. 4.

## 7 Results

Measurements of leakage current in all three barrel layers from February 2011 (early in LHC operation) to November 2018 are shown in Figure 7. The \(B\)-Layer (red points) shows the highest leakage current consistently. Layer-1 (blue points) and Layer-2 (green points) have progressively lower levels. Measurements on each layer are averaged over the representative sample of modules in \(z\) and \(\phi\) as is shown in Figures 2 and 3. The measurements are consistent with expected higher levels of radiation for sensors closer to the interaction point. The Hamburg Model predictions have been scaled to match the measured leakage current with a luminosity-to-fluence scaling factor applied for each layer. The scaling factors are determined in four \(z\)-binned regions for each layer; these can be found in Table 5. The average of the scaled Hamburg Model predictions in each is used to compare to the average leakage current data. After the application of the scale factors, the Hamburg Model predictions fit well to the data throughout the

Leakage current data are shown for periods of operation when the high voltage is applied across the silicon sensor; the average module bias voltage is shown in the middle panel of Figure 7. Some dates corresponding to extended periods when the LHC beams were off, resulting in annealing of the sensors, are displayed within the lower panel with gray vertical lines. The module temperatures are taken to be 18 \({}^{\circ}\)C during these shutdown periods. During part of the shutdown (LS1) between LHC Run 1 and Run 2, from February 2013 to February 2014 (LS1 ended in April 2015), the Pixel Detector was removed from the ATLAS cavern and kept at 22 \({}^{\circ}\)C.

Each bin is defined based on the center location of the modules that are included in the bin; one centimeter is added to or subtracted from the center location in defining the bin limits to include the center position of all modules in the bin.

Figure 7: Average measured leakage current of a representative sample of modules in the ATLAS Pixel Detector barrel layers over the full period of operation. The scaled prediction from the Hamburg Model is also shown.

Measured ratios of the average leakage current for modules on the \(B\)-Layer relative to the average leakage current for modules on Layer-2, and of the average leakage current for modules on Layer-1 relative to the average leakage current of modules on Layer-2, are shown in Figure 8 for LHC Run 2. These ratios are, as predicted, constant as a function of integrated luminosity. Once again, some dates corresponding to extended periods when the LHC beams were off are displayed with gray vertical lines. Also shown in Figure 8 are the ratios of the unscaled Hamburg Model predictions for LHC Run 2. The vertical axis is proportional to the ratio of the applied fluence. The fluence of one layer relative to other layers is well predicted without the need for scale factors.

The leakage current shows a dependence in the axial position, \(z\), and this dependence is discussed in Section 7.1. The leakage current does not show dependence on \(\phi\), see Section 7.2. Leakage current magnitude is highest in modules closest to the interaction point.

### Leakage Current versus Axial Position

The Hamburg Model prediction has been scaled to match the leakage current data in the bins of \(z\) that are monitored by the power supply system. Figure 9 shows the \(z\)-dependence of the leakage current data with single module precision as well as multiple module precision. The quality of the scaled Hamburg Model is confirmed with the two independent measurements. The uncertainty on the Hamburg Model prediction is 3.8%. Missing HVP4 data are due to temporary power shutdowns.

The scaled Hamburg Model prediction is also shown. Missing HVPP4 data are due to temporary power shutdowns. Twenty to twenty-two modules are included in each power supply bin for the \(B\)-Layer and twelve to sixteen modules are included in each power supply bin for Layer-1 and Layer-2.

## 8 Sensitivity to the Effective Silicon Band Gap Energy Value

A study is performed to investigate the sensitivity of the predicted leakage current to the value used for effective silicon band gap, \(E_{\mathrm{eff}}\). The study uses currents recorded in modules located in the range [\(-38.0\)\(<z<-23.7\)] cm. Several predictions were generated, all normalized to 0 \({}^{\circ}\)C, each using a different value of \(E_{\mathrm{eff}}\). The leakage current data were also normalized to 0 \({}^{\circ}\)C and analyzed once with each unique value of \(E_{\mathrm{eff}}\). Note that the value of \(E_{\mathrm{eff}}\) is also used in the temperature normalization step. The impact of using different values of \(E_{\mathrm{eff}}\) can be seen in Figure 20. Empirical studies show that \(E_{\mathrm{eff}}\) depends on received fluence [5], and selecting the nominal silicon band gap energy (\(E_{\mathrm{g}}\) =1.12) for analyzing leakage current is not suitable. Figure 20 demonstrates that the value of \(E_{\mathrm{eff}}\) impacts the analysis. If the value of \(E_{\mathrm{eff}}\) deviates from 1.21, the scale factor needed to bring the Hamburg Model into agreement with the data will change. This topic is of contemporary interest. Further empirical evidence should be used to verify the correct value of \(E_{\mathrm{eff}}\). In parallel, the values used for silicon hardness factors should be investigated.

Figure 20: Several predictions of leakage current were generated, all normalized to 0 \({}^{\circ}\)C, each using a different value of \(E_{\mathrm{eff}}\). The leakage current data were also normalized to 0 \({}^{\circ}\)C and analyzed once with each unique value of \(E_{\mathrm{eff}}\). The value of \(E_{\mathrm{eff}}\) is used in the temperature normalization step. Three pairs of leakage current data and predictions with the Hamburg Model, with three \(E_{\mathrm{eff}}\) values used to analyze them are shown here. Leakage current are compared to a Hamburg Model prediction using 3 different values of \(E_{\mathrm{eff}}\).

Comparisons of Measured and Predicted Fluence

Comparisons of fluence predictions by Pythia8 + FLUKA to the fluence determined from leakage current data combined with predictions by the Hamburg Model are shown in Figure 21 for the \(B\)-Layer, Layer-1, and Layer-2 and for the disks in Figure 22. Fluence predictions by Pythia8 + FLUKA are weighted averages of the fluence predicted at the three center of mass energies for the full period of the measurement. The statistical uncertainty on the fluence as predicted with Pythia8 + FLUKA is less than 1%. The combined statistical and systematic uncertainty on the fluence as determined from leakage data and the Hamburg model predictions is 11.5%; this excludes systematics associated with hardness factors.

Fluence predicted with Pythia8 + Geant4 in Run 2 and Pythia8 + FLUKA in Run 1 is also shown in Figure 21. Geant4 provides an alternative transport model.

The horizontal bars on the fluence points determined from leakage current data combined with predictions by the Hamburg Model reflect the bin ranges.

Differences between the fluence predictions and the fluence determined from leakage current data combined with predictions by the Hamburg Model is an open area of research. Further empirical evidence of the value of \(E_{\text{eff}}\) is needed. Further studies of the particle hardness factors used as input to the fluence simulations are also critical for improving the comparisons.

The horizontal bars on the fluence points determined from leakage current data combined with predictions by the Hamburg Model reflect the bin ranges.

## 10 Lifetime Projections

The existing data trends are used to extrapolate the leakage currents in the \(B\)-Layer through Run 3 of the LHC. Run 3 is expected to begin in February 2021 and end in December 2023. The extrapolation, see Figure 23, is made using a temperature scenario (Scenario 1) where, during periods when the detector is off, the temperature of the detector will be maintained at -5 \({}^{\circ}\)C. For comparison, two additional scenarios are also considered, where the temperature is maintained at -1 \({}^{\circ}\)C and at -9 \({}^{\circ}\)C during shutdown periods (Scenarios 2 and 3, respectively). There will be times during the shutdown when, to permit detector maintenance, the temperature cannot be maintained at the nominal level. In these situations, when the cooling is off, it is expected that the temperature of the detector will come to equilibrium with the temperature of the ATLAS pit (18 \({}^{\circ}\)C). The objective in LS2 is to keep these times to a minimum. Four weeks at 18 \({}^{\circ}\)C have been introduced into these scenarios for LS2. During LHC Run 3 the sensors are expected to be kept at -12 \({}^{\circ}\)C during operation and -5 \({}^{\circ}\)C during planned technical and machine development shutdowns. Again, two additional scenarios, with -1 \({}^{\circ}\)C and with -9 \({}^{\circ}\)C, are simulated for comparison. An additional four weeks where the detector is kept at the temperature of the ATLAS pit (18 \({}^{\circ}\)C) is introduced during these yearly shutdowns in LHC Run 3. The LHC is expected to deliver an additional integrated luminosity of 240 fb\({}^{-1}\) during Run 3 at \(\sqrt{s}=14\) TeV. This integrated luminosity is converted to expected fluence using predictions made with Pythia8 + FLUKA. The Hamburg Model projections of leakage current through Run 3 are made with these parameters and scaled with the scaling factors extracted from the Run 2 measurements and Hamburg Model predictions. These projections are based on the Run 1 and Run 2 temperatures for the \(B\)-Layer bin overlapping the interaction point, \([-13.3<z<1.0]\) cm, where the leakage current level is highest. For comparison, Figure 23 includes the leakage current data from this bin.

The leakage current drop due to annealing during shutdown periods is larger when the sensors are held at higher temperatures; but in higher temperature scenarios the bias voltage level required for full depletion increases. A compromise must be met to obtain optimal functionality in Run 3. Scenario 2 is the planned temperature scenario for LS2 and Run 3. The projection shows that maintaining the temperature below 0\({}^{\circ}\)C during shutdown periods produces a situation where the projected leakage current is relatively insensitive to the temperature.

Projections based on other sensor characteristics limitations, such as bias voltage requirements, can be used to estimate the lifetime of the sensors. The magnitude of the power supply and services limit on bias voltage is 600 V. Predicted bias voltages required for full depletion of the silicon sensors are not covered in this article. If the applied current exceeds approximately 2 mA per module, the power supplies and services will not be able to sustain power necessary to operate the modules. This is an investigation of the expected requirement on power supply current after fluences received in Run 3. The volume normalization applied to the previous measurements has been removed in Figure 23 in order to investigate the current supplied directly by the power supply system. For an exact comparison the temperature normalization of the projection is also scaled down to -12\({}^{\circ}\)C, the approximately nominal operating temperature of the sensors. Including a safety factor on the projections, by multiplying the projected leakage current in Figure 23 by two, indicated that the detector will remain within the power supplies and services limitations for applied current.

Figure 23: (a) The projection of leakage current levels through LHC Run 3. During Run 1 and Run 2, the temperatures used for simulation of the model use the temperature recorded in the \(B\)-Layer bin overlapping the interaction point, (\(-13.3<z<1.0\)) cm. Leakage current data in this bin are also shown. The temperature normalization is applied using the operating temperature of the sensors (which is roughly -12 \({}^{\circ}\)C). The volume normalizations are removed so that the leakage current projections represent the leakage current per module. The power supply and services limitations for leakage current is 2 mA per module and in the projection scenarios shown here the leakage current will remain below this limit. (b) The projected temperature levels throughout the long shutdown and the LHC Run 3 operations for three scenarios are shown as a function of date.

Summary and Conclusions

Measurements of leakage current for the ATLAS Pixel Detector barrel layers \(B\)-Layer, Layer-1, and Layer-2 are presented and compared to predictions by the Hamburg Model. The first leakage current measurements of the disks are also presented. The leakage current levels of the disk sensors are higher than the levels on Layer-2. The Hamburg Model matches the data well over the full time period of the measurement after a scale factor is applied for each layer and disk. These Hamburg Model predictions are instructive for making lifetime predictions.

The difference between the fluence predicted by Pythia8 + FLUKA and the fluence extracted from the leakage current data and the Hamburg Model predictions provides input for corrections to the predicted fluence throughout the detector. The differences between the predictions and the data (summarized in Tables 5 and 6) range from 20% at the barrel ends to as much as 50% at \(z=0\). Direct comparison of the fluence determined by Pythia8 + FLUKA is shown in Figures 21 and 22.

The \(B\)-Layer sensors are projected to require well under 2 mA at the end of Run 3 in 2023, implying that leakage current will not limit the operation of the Pixel detector sensors throughout Run 3. The investigations of leakage current presented here, together with plans for continued monitoring, provide confidence that the Pixel Detector will continue to collect data with high efficiency through the end of LHC Run 3 in 2023.
