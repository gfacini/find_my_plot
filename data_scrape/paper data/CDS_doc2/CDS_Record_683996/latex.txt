**Abstract**

Resonant production of excited quarks at the CERN LHC by the quark gluon fusion process and their subsequent decay to ordinary quarks and weak gauge bosons \(W\) and \(Z\) is investigated. Event selection cuts are applied to separate the signal from background. At an integrated luminosity of \(3\times 10^{5}\) pb\({}^{-1}\), the mass reaches of 7 TeV for \(qW\) and 4.5 TeV for \(qZ\) channel are achieved.

Introduction

A consequence of a possible substructure of quarks is the existence of excited quarks \(q^{\star}\) with masses of the order of the compositeness scale \(\Lambda\). Excited quarks have been discussed in [1, 2], and several types of experimental limits on masses and couplings have been obtained [3, 4, 6]. The CDF [4] and D0 [6] Collaborations have excluded the mass region below \(540\) GeV for both photon+jet (\(\gamma j\)) and \(W\)+jet ( \(Wj\) ) decay channels and excluded the mass region \(80<m^{\star}<570\) GeV using the dijet ( \(jj\) ) channel. More recently, mass ranges \(200<m^{\star}<520\) GeV and \(580<m^{\star}<760\) GeV for excited quarks in the double jets channel have been excluded by CDF[5]. The D0 Collaboration has excluded the mass region \(200<m^{\star}<720\) GeV for all channels [6].

Excited quarks can be produced in \(pp\) collisions at the CERN LHC via quark-gluon fusion. They decay to a quark by emitting any gauge boson (\(g\),\(\gamma\), \(W\) or \(Z\)). The mass of the excited quarks is assumed to be at least of the order of the compositeness scale \(\Lambda\). An effective Lagrangian of the magnetic moment type, describing transition between the excited quark of mass \(m^{\star}\) and the common quarks \(q\) is constrained by gauge invariance to be [2]

\[L=\frac{1}{2\Lambda}\overline{q}^{\star}_{R}\sigma^{\mu\nu}\left(g_{s}f_{s} \frac{\lambda_{a}}{2}G^{a}_{\mu\nu}+gf\frac{\tau}{2}W_{\mu\nu}+g^{\prime}f^{ \prime}\frac{Y}{2}B_{\mu\nu}\right)q_{L}+h.c. \tag{1}\]

where \(G^{a}\), \(W\), and \(B\) are the field-strength tensors for the \(SU(3)\), \(SU(2)\), and \(U(1)\) gauge fields, respectively; \(\lambda_{a}\), \(\tau\), and \(Y\) are the corresponding gauge structure constants; and \(g_{s}\), \(g\), and \(g^{\prime}\) are the corresponding gauge coupling constants. Finally, \(f_{s}\), \(f\), and \(f^{\prime}\) are the couplings determined by the compositeness dynamics.

Excited quarks can be searched for in the invariant mass spectrum of the decay products, if the lowest excited states of the spectrum are kinematically reachable. The signals for singly produced excited quarks are the large transverse momentum \(jj\), \(\gamma j\), \(Wj\) or \(Zj\) pairs with an invariant mass peaking at \(m^{\star}\).

This work is a continuation of previous works devoted to the study of the excited quark production with subsequent decay to a quark and photon [7] and to a quark and gluon[8]. In the present note, the quark \(+\)\(W/Z\) decay mode is investigated. If the excited quarks are sufficiently heavy, \(m^{\star}\)\(>\)\(m_{W,Z}\), they can decay into a quark \(q\) and an intermediate weak vector boson \(W\) or \(Z\) with the following decay widths ( \(V=W,Z\) ):

\[\Gamma(q^{\star}\to qV)=\frac{1}{8}\frac{g_{V}^{2}}{4\pi}f_{V}^{2}\frac{m^{ \star 3}}{\Lambda^{2}}\left(1-\frac{m_{V}^{2}}{m^{\star 2}}\right)^{2}\left(2+ \frac{m_{V}^{2}}{m^{\star 2}}\right) \tag{2}\]

where \(f_{Z}=fT_{3}\cos^{2}\theta_{W}-f^{\prime}\frac{Y}{2}\sin^{2}\theta_{W}\) and \(f_{W}=\frac{f}{\sqrt{2}}\) with \(T_{3}\) and \(Y\) being the third component of the weak isospin and the weak hypercharge of the excited quark \(q^{\star}\), respectively. \(g_{W}=g_{e}/\sin\theta_{W}\) (\(g_{e}=\sqrt{4\pi\alpha}\)) and \(g_{Z}=g_{W}/\cos\theta_{W}\) are the standard model \(W\) and \(Z\) coupling constants, respectively. \(m_{V}\) is the mass of the weak gauge boson \(W\) or \(Z\).

## 2 Simulation

In this work, only the first generation of excited quarks \(u^{\star}\) and \(d^{\star}\) was simulated for the excited quark signal.

For a comparison with the other decay channels, the decay widths \(\Gamma\) of the excited quarks into ordinary quarks plus gauge bosons \(g,W,Z,\gamma\) and the relative branching ratios BR, obtained from PYTHIA [9], are given in Table 1 for the excited quark masses \(m^{\star}=1,3,5\) TeV and for the couplings \(f=f^{\prime}=1\), taking \(\Lambda=m^{\star}\). The decay widths of excited quarks to weak gauge bosons plus ordinary quarks represent \(\sim 15\%\) of the total decay width.

The simulation of the excited quark signal (quark and \(W\) or \(Z\)) and relevant backgrounds was performed with ATLFAST [10] to take into account the experimental conditions prevailing at LHC for the ATLAS detector[11].

The hadronic calorimeters were used to reconstruct the energy of jets in cells of dimensions \(\Delta\eta\times\Delta\phi=0.1\times 0.1\) within the pseudorapidity range \(-2.5<\eta<2.5\), where \(\phi\) is the azimuthal angle. The hadronic energy resolution is given by \(0.5/\sqrt{E(GeV)}{\oplus}0.03\) over this \(\eta\) region. Hadronic showers are regarded as jets when they lie within a cone of radius \(\Delta R=0.7\) and possess a transverse energy \(E_{T}>15\) GeV.

The electromagnetic calorimeters were used to reconstruct the energy of leptons in cells of dimensions \(\Delta\eta\times\Delta\phi=0.025\times 0.025\) within the same pseudorapidity range \(-2.5<\eta<2.5\). The electromagnetic energy resolution is given by \(0.1/\sqrt{E(GeV)}{\oplus}0.005\) over this \(\eta\) region. Electromagnetic showers are identified as leptons when they lie within a cone of radius \(\Delta R=0.1\) and possess a transverse energy \(E_{T}>5\) GeV. Lepton isolation criteria were applied. They require a distance \(\Delta R>0.4\) from other clusters and a maximum transverse energy \(E_{T}<10\) GeV deposition in cells in a cone of radius \(\Delta R=0.2\) around the electron emission direction. This study is restricted to the use of the calorimetric systems of ATLAS for investigating both jet and lepton mode of \(W/Z\) decays.

### \(q^{\star}\to qW\) Channel

The Feynman diagram for the processes \(ug\to u^{\star}\to dW\to df\bar{f}^{\prime}\) or \(dg\to d^{\star}\to uW\to uf\bar{f}^{\prime}\) is considered and shown in Fig. 1.

Partonic level information from PYTHIA for the decay products of the excited quarks is shown in Fig. 2 (\(qW\) channel). As can be seen from Fig. 2, the jets in the signal events have high transverse momenta ( \(\sim\) 415 GeV ) in the mid-rapidity region. The signal for \(u^{\star}\) production is roughly twice as large as for \(d^{\star}\) due to the parton distributions in the proton. In this case, the events including \(d\) quark accompanied with \(W^{+}\) boson is dominating over \(uW^{-}\) final state at the partonic level (see Fig. 1). The transverse momentum distributions have a maximum at the half mass of the excited quarks. Therefore, \(p_{T}\) and \(\eta\) cuts could help to eliminate the corresponding backgrounds.

Signal and backgrounds lead to 3-jet events or 1-jet+1 lepton +1 neutrino events. The

main background for these signal processes comes from single production of \(W/Z\) particles which produces a large number of jets originating from processes like \(W/Z\to\) 2 jets. Processes which involve the production of \(W\) and \(Z\) bosons (with their subsequent decay to leptons) were analyzed. Since the background dominates over the \(q^{\star}\) signal in the 3-jet channel, we have selected only \(W\) bosons which decay leptonically into electrons or muons with high transverse momentum \(p_{T}>30\) GeV and event missing transverse energy \(E_{T}>50\) GeV. The lepton was required to have \(|\eta|<2.5\) and to be separated from any nearby jets by \(\Delta R>0.4\) in \(\eta-\phi\) space. The longitudinal neutrino momentum \(p_{z},\) in the decay of a \(W\), has been constrained to give an \(l\nu\) invariant mass equal to the \(W\) boson mass of 80 GeV ( \(W\) mass constraint).

The effective mass distributions of the \(jl\nu\) system obtained from ATLFAST for different \(m^{\star}\) are shown in Figure 3. One can see that the widths of the mass distributions are small even for high values of \(m^{\star}\).

The relevant signal and background cross-sections are presented in Tables 2 and 3, respectively. Here the background contributions from:

* the lowest order \(W+jet\) production
* \(WW\) and \(WZ\) processes (the second \(W\) or \(Z\) is assumed to decay to jets, and one of the jets is missed out of acceptance)

### \(q^{\star}\to qZ\) Channel

The Feynman diagram for the processes \(ug\to u^{\star}\to uZ\to uf\bar{f}\) or \(dg\to d^{\star}\to dZ\to df\bar{f}\) is represented in Fig. 4. Partonic level information from PYTHIA for the decay products of the excited quarks is shown in Figure 5 (\(qZ\) channel).

As can be seen from Fig. 5, the jets in the signal events have high transverse momenta ( \(\sim\) 415 GeV ) in the mid-rapidity region. The signal for \(u^{\star}\) production is roughly twice as large as for \(d^{\star}\) due to the parton distributions in the proton. However, the square of the couplings of

## 3 Results

The production cross sections for the excited quarks are given in Table 2 and Table 4. The following cuts were used to separate the signal from the background:

* The transverse momentum of jet was required to be at least \(p_{T}>100\) GeV ( for \(m^{\star}=1000\) GeV ) and increased for higher \(m^{\star}\). Minimum transverse momentum cuts were chosen to be around \(m^{\star}/2-\delta p_{T}\), where \(\delta p_{T}\) was optimized for each \(m^{\star}\).
* 9 ( \(qW\) decay ). The distributions were normalized to an integrated luminosity of \(3\times 10^{5}\) pb\({}^{-1}\).

The resulting differential cross section \(d\sigma/dm_{jl\nu}\) distributions for the excited quark mass \(m^{\star}\)= 1000 GeV, 2000 GeV and 3000 GeV with the corresponding backgrounds are given in Figure 10 - 12 ( \(qZ\) decay ). The same normalization as for Figures 7-9 was applied.

The mass bin width selection for all mass distributions is made for the signal and the backgrounds according to the width of the corresponding mass distribution at each mass value. The \(jl\nu\) and \(jll\) invariant mass distributions are integrated around the excited quark masses for different mass bin window \(\Delta m\) to obtain the signal and background number of events.

The number of events for both signal (S) and background (B), and the signal significance (\(S/\sqrt{B}\)) are presented in Table 6 and 7 for \(qW\) and \(qZ\) excited quark decay channels and various couplings, respectively.

The signal significance is defined at each mass point as \(S/\sqrt{B}\) where \(S\) and \(B\) are the number of accepted signal and background events in the selected mass bin, respectively. Achievable mass limits for the relevant channels of the excited quark decay are established by requiring the criteria: \(S/\sqrt{B}>5\) and at least 10 signal events within the cuts per year, which corresponds to a 99% confidence level (C.L.)

The signal significance at each mass point for the channels \(qW\) and \(qZ\) are shown in Figure 13. As can be seen from this plot the masses achieved for excited quarks in the \(qW\) mode are \(7\) TeV for the coupling \(f=f^{\prime}=1\) and \(6.2\) TeV for \(f=f^{\prime}=0.5\) for an integrated luminosity of \(3\times 10^{5}\) pb\({}^{-1}\) at CERN LHC. The corresponding masses for \(qZ\) channel are \(4.5\)

## 4 Conclusion

Excited quarks can be produced with a large cross section in the resonance channel at LHC. The production of excited quarks was evaluated in the framework of a composite model and their subsequent decay of the excited quarks to \(qW\) or \(qZ\) final state were examined. The mass reach achievable at LHC is \(7\) TeV for \(qW\) channel, and \(4.5\) TeV for \(qZ\) channel at the integrated luminosity of \(3\times 10^{5}\) pb\({}^{-1}\), if \(f=f^{\prime}=1\).
