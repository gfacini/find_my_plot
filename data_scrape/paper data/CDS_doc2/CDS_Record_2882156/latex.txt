# ATLAS Run 3 charged particle track seed finding performance

The ATLAS Collaboration

The ATLAS Collaboration

The measurement of charged particle trajectories is essential to reconstruct hadron-hadron collisions at the LHC. The ATLAS collaboration uses a Kalman Filter-based track finding algorithm to reconstruct trajectories out of discrete measurements from the inner detector subsystem, resulting in a high tracking efficiency and a low fake track creation rate. The inner detector being immersed in a solenoidal magnetic field, the track finding algorithm operates under the assumption of helical trajectories and must be initialized with a set of initial track parameters. This note describes the implementation and the performance of the seed finding algorithm that is used in Run 3 to initialize the track finding pass.

## 1 Introduction

The set of reconstructed tracks corresponding to the trajectories of charged particles produced in a collision at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) [1] and recorded by the ATLAS detector [2; 3] is an essential input for many downstream data reconstruction tasks such as jet reconstruction [4] and flavour tagging [5; 6], as well as for many physics analyses. Track reconstruction from ATLAS inner detector data [7] is based on a combinatorial variant of the well-known Kalman Filter algorithm [8] augmented by track candidate ambiguity resolution and a global-\(\chi^{2}\) track fit. The resulting tracks are extended into the TRT straw-tube detector, and the extended tracks are kept whenever their fit \(\chi^{2}\) is better than that of the corresponding original tracks. This algorithm achieves high track reconstruction efficiency and a low fake track creation rate, even in the challenging environment of LHC collisions. The Kalman Filter algorithm is not self-initializing and it needs an initial estimate of the parameters of a helical track that will then be refined by progressively incorporating information from sensitive detector elements. As the inner detector sensor elements by themselves only yield information about the particles' crossing positions, a dedicated initial track candidate finding algorithm is needed to bridge the gap from space-points to track parameters. Such algorithms are typically referred to as seed finding algorithms.

Seed finding algorithms need to achieve very high seed finding efficiency performance because any inefficiency at this stage cannot be recovered by the track finding stage. In addition, a low fake seed rate is also desirable in order to minimize the amount of reconstructed track candidates that are discarded at later stages. The combinatorics of track formation from space-points are especially challenging at the LHC, where, during the third data-taking run of the LHC (Run 3) the expected number of inelastic proton-proton interaction per event, \(\mu\), has a distribution with a mean around 45 and a tail reaching upwards of 70.

This note describes the seed finding algorithm used in the Run 3 ATLAS software and provides a characterization of its performance. Descriptions of seed finding strategies of other LHC experiments can be found in Refs. [9; 10; 11]. The rest of the note is structured as follows: The ATLAS inner detector is described in Section 2, followed by a description of the seed finding algorithm and its place in the ATLAS inner tracking software chain in Section 3. The metrics used to characterize the algorithm's performance are explained in Section 4, before a discussion of the results in Section 5. Concluding remarks can be found in Section 6.

## 2 ATLAS detector

The ATLAS detector [2; 3] is a general-purpose, forward-backward symmetric, cylindrical particle detector with near complete coverage of the solid angle around the LHC interaction point1. From the inside-out, it comprises an inner tracking detector, electromagnetic and hadronic calorimeters, and a muon spectrometer installed within a toroidal magnet system.

Footnote 1: ATLAS uses a right-handed coordinate system with its origin at the nominal interaction point (IP) in the centre of the detector and the \(z\)-axis along the beam pipe. The \(x\)-axis points from the IP to the centre of the LHC ring, and the \(y\)-axis points upward. Cylindrical coordinates \((r,\phi)\) are used in the transverse plane, \(\phi\) being the azimuthal angle around the \(z\)-axis. The pseudorapidity is defined in terms of the polar angle \(\theta\) as \(\eta=-\ln\tan(\theta/2)\).

The inner detector (ID) covers the pseudorapidity range \(|\eta|<2.5\) and is housed inside a thin superconducting solenoid which provides a 2 T axial magnetic field. The ID is composed of three subsystems, as can be seen in Figure 1: a silicon pixel detector, a silicon strip detector (SCT), and the Transition Radiationtracker (TRT). The pixel detector provides high-precision two-dimensional measurements per track. It comprises four barrel layers in the central region and three endcap disk layers in the forward and backward regions. The nominal pixel size in the three outer barrel layers and in the endcap disks is \(50~{}\mu\mathrm{m}\times 400~{}\mu\mathrm{m}\), and the innermost barrel layer (IBL) [13] has finer grained sensors with a pixel size of \(50~{}\mu\mathrm{m}\times 250~{}\mu\mathrm{m}\). The SCT detector has four barrel layers and nine endcap disks in the forward and backward regions. Each module is made up of a pair of silicon strip sensors at a stereo angle of 40 mrad, each with a nominal strip pitch of 80 \(\mu\mathrm{m}\) and each strip provides a one-dimensional measurement. This subsystem provides precise one-dimensional measurement pairs for each charged particle intersection with a module. The TRT is a gaseous straw-tube detector providing typically 30 lower precision measurements per track at large radius.

## 3 Seed finding algorithm description

The ATLAS seed finding algorithm [14] builds tracks using triplets of three-dimensional space-points, with each space-point being reconstructed from the measurements recorded by the detector elements. This requires a precise knowledge of the location and orientation of the ID active sensors, which is determined through the process of alignment [15]. As the measurements from the ID are not inherently three-dimensional, they are first converted to the appropriate representation in the lab-frame. The pixel detector yields two-dimensional measurements and the third dimension is defined by the sensor position, which means that the conversion is a simple coordinate transformation from the local frame of reference of the module to the lab-frame. The procedure is more complex for the SCT, because a particle crossing a module yields two one-dimensional measurements per module. The pair of measurements is combined into a single two-dimensional measurement using the stereo angle between the silicon strips on opposite module sides. A coordinate transformation from the local frame of reference of the module to the lab-frame is then performed, supplemented with a projective correction to obtain a three-dimensional space-point situated between the two strip clusters.

Seed tracks (seeds) are formed by identifying sets of three pixel or SCT space-points. Seeds formed by

Figure 1: cross-section of the ATLAS inner detector showing each of the major elements with its active dimensions [12].

a combination of pixel and SCT measurements are not considered anymore because they were found to yield a high number of fake tracks at Run 3 pileup levels. A set of geometrical cuts is used to build seed tracks with triplets of space-points while minimizing the combinatorics. As the pixel detector is closest to the interaction point, the space-points from this subsystem are closer together which means that the geometrical cuts are less efficient. To minimize the execution time, the seed finding and subsequent track finding pass proceeds in three stages. Firstly, seeds are formed from the SCT space-points which have a lower fake rate. Next, the Kalman Filter-based track finding algorithm is run starting from the SCT seeds. The SCT seeds are then used to compute a region-of-interest (RoI) in \(z\) corresponding to the luminous region of the bunch crossing. Finally, seed and track finding are performed in the pixel detector, discarding seeds whose \(z\) parameter falls outside of the RoI.

Seed finding proceeds by first segmenting the 3D space of the pixel or SCT detector into bins of \(\phi\)-\(z\), which are optimised according to the maximum azimuthal deflection given the position of the sensitive layer on the detector and the lowest allowed seed \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) value (450 MeV, which corresponds to 90% of the track finding \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) cut of 500 MeV). When moving radially outwards from the interaction point, the central space-points for the seeds are identified in each bin. For each central space-point, lists of space-points from detector layers above and below the central space-point, referred to as top and bottom candidates respectively, are identified in the same or neighboring \(\phi\)-\(z\) bins. The selection of neighbouring \(\phi\)-\(z\) bins is based on geometrical assumptions relative to the interaction point, while the collection of central, top and bottom space-point candidates within the considered bins relies on geometrical requirements derived from the detector layout. For instance, the radial position of the central space-point, the radial position of the top and bottom space-point candidates, as well as the maximum and minimum distance (in \(r\) and \(z\)) between them and the central space-point are taken into account.

Individual top and bottom space-point candidates are then filtered based on the angle in \(z\)-\(r\) space between the candidate and the central space-point, in order to quickly remove seed tracks likely to have \(|\eta|>2.7\). A cut is also imposed on the \(z\) value of each segment extrapolated to the beamline, \(z(r=0)\), in order to quickly remove seeds which are outside of the acceptance in \(z\). For SCT seeds, the cut values are set to \(|z(r=0)|<250\) mm, while for pixel seeds they are set based on the RoI computed from the SCT-seeded track finding pass.

At this point, the algorithm works out which space-point doublets, bottom-central and central-top space-point combinations, can successfully build up seeds. This is done checking the compatibility between the \(r\)-\(z\) slopes of the bottom-central and central-top space-point doublets assuming the largest possible multiple scattering effect given the minimum allowed \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) value. Exploiting the inverse conformal transformation, the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) of the seed candidates is measured to further reject space-point combinations; it is required to be larger than 450 MeV and is used to refine the multiple scattering term for the \(r\)-\(z\) slopes compatibility of the seed space-point doublets. The remaining seed tracks are described using the perigee parametrization [16]\(\tau=(d_{0},z_{0},\phi,\theta,q/p)\), where the parameters define the seed track at the point of closest approach in the transverse plane with respect to the beam spot. The transverse impact parameter \(d_{0}\) represents the distance of closest approach in the transverse plane, while the longitudinal impact parameter \(z_{0}\) gives the \(z\)-coordinate of the perigee point. \(\phi\) and \(\theta\) are the azimuthal and polar angle of the seed track, respectively. The ratio \(q/p\) is the charge \(q\) multiplied by the inverse of the momentum \(p\) and is determined from the measurement of the track curvature. The remaining space-point triplet combinations are required to fulfill \(d_{0}<5\) mm.

Each seed is then assigned a quality score which emphasizes seeds with small \(d_{0}\) and small curvature in the longitudinal plane. During the scoring phase, each seed is checked for compatibility with an extra space-point, by exchanging the topmost space-point for one in a different layer and verifying that the resulting seed has a compatible curvature in the transverse plane with the original seed. If such a space-point is found, the seed is deemed "confirmed" and receives a scoring bonus. Otherwise, the \(d_{0}\) cut is tightened by an amount proportional to the curvature of the seed in the longitudinal plane. The resulting quality score determines which seeds are ultimately kept, separately for pixel and SCT seeds. For the pixel case, all confirmed seeds are kept, and otherwise at most one seed per central space-point is kept. For the SCT case, at most five seeds per central space-point are kept.

To reduce the number of duplicate tracks, seeds for which all space-points are used by already found tracks are discarded at the start of the subsequent the track finding stage. However, since this note studies the seeding algorithm before the track finding stage, these duplicate seeds are considered in the results presented in Section 5.

## 4 Simulated datasets and performance metrics

All metrics are evaluated on a sample of \(t\bar{t}\) events modelled using the PowhegBox v2[17, 18, 19, 20] generator at NLO with the NNPDF3.0nlo[21] PDF set and the \(h_{\text{damp}}\) parameter2 set to \(1.5\leavevmode\nobreak\ m_{\text{top}}\)[22]. The events were interfaced to Pythia 8.230[23] to model the parton shower, hadronisation, and underlying event, with parameters set according to the A14 tune [24] and using the NNPDF2.3lo set of PDFs [25]. The decays of bottom and charm hadrons were performed by EvtGen 1.6.0[26]. The effect of multiple interactions in the same and neighbouring bunch crossings (pileup) was modelled by overlaying the simulated hard-scattering event with inelastic proton-proton (\(pp\)) events generated with Pythia 8.186[27] using the NNPDF2.3lo set of parton distribution functions (PDF) [25] and the A3 set of tuned parameters [28]. The nominal number of overlaid \(p\)-\(p\) collisions was sampled uniformly in the \(\mu\in(0,80)\) range for each signal event, with the actual number sampled from a Poisson distribution. The generated events are then processed through a simulation of the ATLAS detector and reconstructed using an extensive software suite [29], the same that is used for real collision data.

Footnote 2: The \(h_{\text{damp}}\) parameter is a resummation damping factor and one of the parameters that controls the matching of Powheg matrix elements to the parton shower and thus effectively regulates the high-\(p_{\text{T}}\) radiation against which the \(t\bar{t}\) system recoils.

To determine the performance of the seed finding algorithm, seeds are linked to their most likely truth particle by tracing the origin of the seed measurements (clusters), using the following procedure. For each seed, a seed-truth particle matching probability is computed by dividing the number of measurements that the seed has in common with the truth particle by the total number of measurements per seed. Each seed has three measurements for pixel seeds and six for SCT seeds, because each SCT space-point is made up of two measurements. The truth matching probability is computed for all the truth particles that have measurements in common with the seed. The truth particle with the highest matching probability is chosen as the best truth match for the seed. If no matching truth particle is found, the seed is assigned a truth matching probability of zero. This procedure is repeated for all seeds in the event.

To determine the seed finding efficiency, the seed-to-particle mapping is inverted using the seed-truth matching probabilities. If all the potential seed matches for a truth particle have a matching probability of less than 50%, the particle is considered to have no seed match, otherwise it is matched to one or more seeds.

The performance metrics considered in this study are: seed finding efficiency, seed duplication rate, seed fake rate, and seed parameter resolutions. The seed finding efficiency, seed duplication rate, and seed parameter resolutions are computed using the truth particles that pass the selection cuts shown in Table 1.

The transverse momentum, \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\), and pseudorapidity selection criteria correspond to the reconstructed \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) and the ID acceptance respectively. Stable particles are labelled as such during event generation and identifies those particles that are included in the final state produced by the Monte Carlo generator. Particles produced from interactions with the detector material are excluded. Particles produced near the interaction point are selected with a requirement on the production vertex radius.

The seed finding efficiency is defined as the fraction of truth particles that are matched to at least one seed. This quantity is computed inclusively for all the seeds, as well as separately for pixel and SCT seeds. The pixel (SCT) seeding efficiency is defined as the fraction of truth particles that are matched to at least one pixel (SCT) seed.

The seed duplication rate is defined as the fraction of truth particles matched to at least two seeds. This metric is computed inclusively for all seeds as well as separately for pixel and SCT seeds, in which case the definition is modified to include the requirement that more than 50% of the seed matches per particle originate from pixel or SCT seeds, respectively.

A seed is considered to be fake if its seed-truth particle matching probability is less than 50%, in which case the seed is likely arising from random combinatorics or includes space-points arising from noise. The fraction of fake seeds (fake rate) is computed inclusively for all seeds, as well as separately for pixel and SCT seeds.

Seed parameter resolutions are determined for the transverse impact parameter \(d_{0}\), the longitudinal impact parameter \(z_{0}\), and the ratio \(q/p_{\mathrm{T}}\), computed as \(q/p_{\mathrm{T}}=q/p\cdot 1/\sin\theta\). For each parameter, the resolution is defined as the root-mean-square (RMS) of the truncated residual between the true parameter value and the parameter value estimated from the seed. The resolution metrics are computed separately for pixel and SCT seeds by restricting the calculation to truth particles where the best matching seed is a pixel or SCT seed, respectively.

## 5 Results

The seed finding efficiency and seed duplicate rate are shown in Figure 2. As shown in Fig. 2(a), the efficiency for SCT seeds is observed to be lower in the endcaps and at low \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\). The overall efficiency stays high over the whole phase-space, but shows a slight trend with lower efficiency in the endcaps (\(\sim 85\%\)) compared to the barrel (\(\sim 95\%\)). This definition of efficiency includes particles lost to hadronic interactions with the inner detector material [30], and less importantly due to sensor inefficiency, gaps in the geometry and dead detector channels and modules.

\begin{tabular}{l l} \hline \hline Property & Selection \\ \hline Stable \& charged & True \\ \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) & \textgreater{} 500 MeV \\ \(|\eta|\) & \textless{} 2.5 \\ Production vertex radius & \textless{} 30 mm \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}

The duplicate rates shown in Figs. 2(c) and 2(d) and fake rates shown in Figure 3 are found to be lower for SCT seeds than pixel seeds. This behavior is expected, since the higher density of space-points in the pixel detector, due to its closeness to the interaction point, leads to more combinatorial seed candidates.3

Footnote 3: While there is a relationship between duplicate rate and time spent in the subsequent track reconstruction stage, some amount of duplication is desirable for robustness against potential seeding inefficiencies.

Figure 4 shows the dependence of the efficiency, duplicate rate, and fake rate on the number of proton-proton interactions, \(\mu\), in a event. As expected, the fake rate increases with \(\mu\) due to increased ambiguity in space-point combinations in higher-occupancy events. The seeding efficiency drops slightly with \(\mu\) due to pattern recognition and seed selection mistakes arising from the harder combinatorics. The duplicate rate also drops slightly with \(\mu\) for the same reason.

The seed parameter resolutions are shown in Figure 5. As a function of the truth particle's transverse momentum, the transverse (\(d_{0}\)) and longitudinal (\(z_{0}\)) impact parameter resolutions (Figures 5(b) and 5(d)) are better for pixel seeds, owing to the closeness of the pixel detector to the beamline and the finer segmentation of pixel sensors. As can be seen in the equivalent \(\eta\)-dependent distributions, (Figures 5(a) and 5(b)), the difference between the two detectors is less than \(\eta\)-dependent.

Figure 2: Seed track finding (a)-(b) efficiency and (c)-(d) duplicate rate as a function of the true charged particle \(\eta\) and \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\). These metrics are defined, respectively, as the fraction of particles to which at least one or two seeds are matched. The particles considered must be stable, charged, and satisfy \(p_{T}>500\) MeV, \(|\eta|<2.5\), and \(R_{\mathrm{prod}}<30\) mm. The efficiency metric includes particles not reconstructed due material interactions.

The particles considered must be stable, charged, and satisfy \(p_{T}>500\) MeV, \(|\eta|<2.5\), and \(R_{\rm prod}<30\) mm. The efficiency metric includes particles not reconstructed due material interactions.

Figure 3: Seed track fake rate as a function of the seed (a) \(\eta\) and (b) \(p_{\rm T}\).

5(c)), this behavior depends on the particle's angle of production with respect to the beamline. This is primarily due to the variation in the amount of detector material as a function of \(\eta\), which results in better resolution at central \(\eta\) where the material in minimized. The pixel seed \(z_{0}\) resolution has a slight degradation at low \(|\eta|\), due to the smaller track length when projected into the longitudinal plane and a projective effect owing to the perigee being defined with respect to \(d_{0}\), causing uncertainties in \(d_{0}\) to transfer to \(z_{0}\).

The relative seed \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) resolution is shown in Figures 5(e) and 5(f). The \(\eta\)-dependence similarly depends on the amount of detector material, but the SCT seed \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) resolution is better than the pixel seed \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) resolution due to the longer lever arms of the SCT seeds.

The resolution is defined as the root-mean-square (RMS) of the residual in a given \(\eta\) or \(p_{\rm T}\) bin. The particles considered must be stable, charged, and satisfy \(p_{T}>500\) MeV, \(|\eta|<2.5\), and \(R_{\rm prod}<30\) mm.

## 6 Conclusion

This note presents the implementation and performance of the seed finding algorithm used to initialize the Kalman Filter-based track finding algorithm. As the efficiency of the seed finding stage represents an upper limit on the subsequent track finding algorithm used for Run 3 reconstruction, the seeding efficiency must be very high, and it was shown to be 85%-95% (compatible with the expected efficiency loss due to hadronic interactions) in \(t\bar{t}\) events for a fiducial selection of stable and charged particles with \(p_{\rm T}>500\) MeV, \(|\eta|<2.5\), and production radius \(<30\) mm. This comes with comparatively high duplicate and fake track seed creation rates, the latter depending directly on the number of interaction per bunch-crossing, \(\mu\). The seeding algorithm has been extensively optimized for Run 3, but since the high-luminosity upgrade of the LHC (HL-LHC), slated to begin operation around 2029, is expected to have \(\mu\) up to 200 -- well in excess of the average value of \(\langle\mu\rangle\) = 45 seen in Run 3 -- the seed finding algorithm is being revisited to cope with the much harder combinatorics. Its configuration is also being updated to exploit the characteristics of the ATLAS Inner Tracker (ITk) [31; 32], which will replace the current Inner Detector in time for the inauguration of the HL-LHC.
