###### Abstract

Silicon diodes fabricated on oxygenated and non-oxygenated silicon wafers with different bulk resistivities (1, 2 and 15 k\(\Omega\)cm) were irradiated with neutrons, pions and protons to fluences up to \(2.4\times 10^{14}\) n/cm\({}^{-2}\). Effective trapping times for electrons and holes were determined by the charge correction method in the temperature range between -50\({}^{\circ}\)C and 20\({}^{\circ}\)C. The measured effective trapping probabilities scale linearly with fluence and decrease with increasing temperature. Irradiation with charged hadrons resulted in about 30 % higher trapping probabilities than with neutrons at the same equivalent fluence. No dependence on silicon resistivity and oxygen concentration was found. The temperature dependence could be parameterized by a power-law scaling. Accelerated annealing at 60\({}^{\circ}\)C showed a 30% increase of hole trapping, measured at 10\({}^{\circ}\)C, and a decrease by about the same amount for electron trapping, both at a time scale of 10 hours.

## 1 Introduction

Segmented silicon detectors will be widely used in experiments at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) for tracking of charged particles. The high luminosity and the large proton-proton inelastic cross section will result in intense fluxes of heavy particles, mainly pions and neutrons, to which silicon detectors and accompanying read-out electronics will be exposed. As an example, the ATLAS Semiconductor Tracker will accumulate fluences up to about \(2\times 10^{14}\) cm\({}^{-2}\) 1 MeV neutron non-ionizing energy loss (NIEL) equivalent during its ten year operation at the collider [1].

Trapping of the drifting charge in traps having emission times longer than the shaping time of the electronics (\(\sim 25\) ns) will reduce the signal [2]. This could be partly overcome by over-depleting of the detector, thereby reducing the drift time and probability for trapping. However the increased effective dopant concentration and leakage current after irradiation impose practical limitations to applicable voltages due to detector breakdown and thermal runaway.

Defect dynamics and the related change of effective dopant concentration and leakage current with time have been extensively studied - see for example [3]. Data on trapping times are, however, relatively scarce [4, 5]. The knowledge of the effective trapping time is, however, of vital importance for an accurate prediction of detector performance at the LHC.

In this work we present a systematic measurement of electron and hole trapping times after irradiation of silicon diodes with neutrons, pions and protons to fluences up to \(2.4\times 10^{14}\) cm\({}^{-2}\) 1 MeV neutron NIEL equivalent. The method used for determination of the effective trapping time is based on the correction of time-resolved current pulse shapes due to trapping, recently proposed independently by two groups [6, 7]. The diodes used in this study were fabricated on silicon of various resistivities and oxygen concentrations. The effective trapping times were determined in the temperature range between -50\({}^{\circ}\)C and 20\({}^{\circ}\)C. Evolution of trapping with time after irradiation was also investigated.

## 2 The Measurement Set-up

A transient current technique (TCT) set-up was used to measure the current response of the detectors to short light pulses. Diodes were mounted in a temperature-controlled optical liquid-nitrogen cryostat, allowing light injection from both \(p^{+}\) and \(n^{+}\) sides of the diode. Current signals were amplified with a fast current amplifier and transmitted to a 500 MHz oscilloscope. A red laser with a wavelength of 670 nm (absorption depth 3.3 \(\mu\)m at 20\({}^{\circ}\)C) and pulse width of approximately 1 ns was used. The short penetration depth of the red light gives the possibility to inject electrons by \(p^{+}\) side illumination and holes by \(n^{+}\) side illumination.

The charge correction method for the determination of the effective trapping time is based on the assumption that the decrease of charge due to trapping is exponential with time, as the charge drifts through the detector. Therefore the integral of the induced current (induced charge) does not saturate in an irradiated detector but exhibits a rise also at voltages above the full depletion voltage (\(V_{F\,D}\)). At higher voltages the drift time is reduced due to the higher electric field and thus less charge gets trapped. To determine the effective trapping time (\(\tau_{eff}\)), the measured induced currents (\(I_{m}(t)\)) are corrected with an exponential \(\exp(t/\tau_{eff})\) so that the integral of the corrected current gives equal charges for all voltages above \(V_{F\,D}\).

For a detailed explanation of the set-up and of the charge correction method the reader is referred to [6].

### Irradiations

Neutron irradiations took place in the core of the TRIGA nuclear reactor of the Jozef Stefan Institute in Ljubljana. The measured and simulated spectrum of neutrons with energies ranging from thermal to fast (\(\sim\)10 MeV) can be found in [8]. Fast neutron (\(E>0.1\) MeV) fluxes up to \(4\times 10^{12}\) cm\({}^{-2}\) s\({}^{-1}\) were measured by gold activation [9] and scaled with the calculated damage factor. They agree with the values obtained from the leakage current method [10] to better than 10% [11]. During the irradiation the diodes were kept at a temperature around 20\({}^{\circ}\)C. The longest irradiation time was about 5 minutes.

Irradiations with pions were performed at the Paul Scherrer Institute in Villigen, Switzerland. The energy of pions was 200 MeV. Equivalent fluences were determined from aluminium foil activation using the damage factor 1.2 (average of values reported in [12] and [13]) as well as with the leakage current method. The highest fluence of \(2.4\times 10^{14}\) cm\({}^{-2}\) was reached within a day. The temperature during irradiation was around 25\({}^{\circ}\)C.

24 GeV/c protons from the CERN PS were used for proton irradiations. Fluences were determined with the same methods as for pion irradiations. The damage factor used for PS protons is 0.62 [3].

### Samples

Several \(p^{+}-n-n^{+}\) pad detectors processed on high (15 k\(\Omega\)cm) and low resistivity (1 k\(\Omega\)cm, 2 k\(\Omega\)cm ) standard and oxygen enriched silicon wafers were irradiated. The samples were produced at ST Microelectronics and at Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL). Their properties and treatment is listed in Table 1. A hole (\(\phi=2\) mm) in the metalization on the \(p^{+}\) side of the diode was used for light injection, while on the \(n^{+}\) side a mesh metalization was provided for the same purpose.

During and after irradiation the diodes were kept unbiased. After the irradiation they were mounted onto an aluminium support using a room-temperature curing conductive glue. Then they were annealed at \(T=20^{\circ}\)C to the minimum in \(V_{F\,D}\). The evolution of \(V_{F\,D}\) during annealing was measured with the \(C-V\) method at the frequency \(\nu=10\) kHz. The minimum values of \(V_{F\,D}\) are shown in Fig. 1. There is a nearly perfect agreement of \(V_{F\,D}\) for samples fabricated on non-oxygenated high-resistivity material at equal NEL equivalent fluences for different particles. Taking into account the negligible remaining donor concentration after irradiation this confirms the dosimetry measurements at different irradiation sites. Once reaching the minimum in \(V_{F\,D}\) the diodes were stored at \(T=-17^{\circ}\)C until the measurements of effective trapping times were performed.

## 3 Results

number of collisions, is proportional to the drift time (\(l=v_{th}\cdot t\)), allowing to introduce the effective trapping probability by

\[q(t)=q(t=0)\cdot e^{-\frac{t}{\tau_{eff}}}. \tag{1}\]

Here \(q(t)\) represents the drifting charge, electrons or holes, created at \(t=0\). The trapping probability can be expressed as:

\[\frac{1}{\tau_{eff_{e,h}}}\,=\,\sum_{t}\,\,N_{t}\,\left(1-P_{t}^{e\,h}\right) \,\sigma_{t_{e,h}}\,v_{h_{e,h}}\quad. \tag{2}\]

Here \(N_{t}\) denotes the trap concentration, \(P_{t}^{e\,h}\) its occupation probability with the relevant carrier, \(v_{h_{e,h}}\) the thermal velocity of drifting carriers and the \(\sigma_{t_{e,h}}\) the carrier capture cross-section. The sum runs over all traps. For traps introduced directly by irradiation, \(N_{t}\) has the form

\[N_{t}=g_{t}\cdot\Phi_{\rm eq}\cdot f_{t}(t) \tag{3}\]

with \(g_{t}\) the introduction rate and \(f_{t}(t)\) representing (exponential) trap annealing with time after irradiation. On the other hand, Eq. 3 with appropriately modified \(f_{t}(t)\) can also describe traps originating from decays of primary defects. A more general form, including \(\Phi_{\rm eq}^{2}\) terms, would be needed to describe traps formed by reactions between defects.

If traps described by Eq. 3 (\(N_{t}\propto\Phi_{\rm eq}\)) dominate, the effective trapping probability at a given temperature and time after irradiation can be parameterized as

\[\frac{1}{\tau_{eff_{e,h}}}\,=\,\beta_{e,h}(t,T)\,\Phi_{\rm eq}\quad. \tag{4}\]

The aim of this study is to evaluate \(\beta_{e,h}\) as a function of irradiation particle type, silicon material and temperature, and its dependence on time after irradiation.

### Material and particle dependence

The effective trapping probability for electrons and holes, measured at \(T=-10^{\circ}\)C after \(\sim 10\) days of room temperature annealing, for different particles and silicon materials can be seen in Fig. 2. A clear linear dependence of the trapping probability on \(\Phi_{\rm eq}\) can be observed, indicating an effective absence of trapping centres formed in second-order reactions. The resistivity of the silicon material in the range from 1 k\(\Omega\)cm to 15 k\(\Omega\)cm does not influence the effective trapping probability. There is also no difference between standard and oxygenated silicon materials, although the latter exhibits a smaller increase of negative space charge upon charged hadron irradiation [3].

It appears, however, that different particle types have different \(\beta_{e,h}\) as can be seen in Table 2. \(\beta_{e,h}\) for charged hadrons are about 30-40% larger than those for neutrons. The effective trapping probability thus does not scale with

Measurements were taken at \(T=-10^{\circ}\)C after \(\sim 10\) days of annealing at room temperature. Resistivity and material type are given in brackets: O-oxygenated and S-standard material.

NEL when comparing neutrons with charged particles. As demonstrated in section 2.1., the agreement of \(V_{FD}\) of standard material at the same equivalent fluences for different irradiations excludes a dosimetry error required to cause the observed level of \(\beta_{e,h}\) dependence on particle type. A possible qualitative explanation could be that NIEL from charged hadrons produces more point defects than NIEL of neutrons which in turn creates more cluster defects. Point defects thus appear to be more efficient as trapping centres. Since oxygen acts as a vacancy sink and is observed not to influence trapping, these defects are likely to be interstitial-related.

### Temperature dependence

Three parameters in \(\beta_{e,h}\) depend on temperature: thermal velocity of the carriers, capture cross-sections and occupation probabilities of the traps. A square-root temperature dependence is characteristic for \(v_{th_{e,h}}\). The capture cross-section dependence on temperature is poorly known, scaling as \(\sigma(T)/\sigma(T_{o})=(T/T_{o})^{m}\) with \(m\) ranging between -2 and 2 is suggested in [14, 15].

Let us assume that one defect dominates trapping of the drifting electrons and equivalently, there exists a dominating hole trap. The occupation probability of a trap, described by the energy level \(E_{t}\), in the depleted region can be calculated using Shockley-Read-Hall statistics as [16]:

\[P_{t}^{e}(T)\,=\,\frac{1}{\frac{c_{e}}{c_{h}}\chi_{t}^{2}+1}\quad,\quad P_{t}^ {h}\,(T)\,=\,1-P_{t}^{e}(T)\quad,\quad p\approx n\approx 0 \tag{5}\]

\[\chi_{t}=\exp{(\frac{E_{t}-E_{i}}{k_{B}\,T})}\quad,\quad c_{e,h}=\sigma_{t_{e, h}}\,v_{th_{e,h}} \tag{6}\]

\[E_{i}\;=\;\frac{E_{g}}{2}+\frac{1}{2}\,k_{b}\,T\,\ln{(\frac{P_{v}}{N_{c}})} \quad,\quad\frac{P_{v}}{N_{c}}=0.371\quad,\quad E_{g}=1.12\,\,\,\mathrm{eV} \tag{7}\]

where \(E_{i}\) denotes the Fermi level in intrinsic silicon, \(k_{B}\) the Boltzmann constant, and \(P_{v}\) and \(N_{c}\) the effective densities of states in the valence and con

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|} \hline  & \(\beta_{e}\) [\(10^{-16}\) cm\({}^{2}\)/ns] & \(\beta_{h}\) [\(10^{-16}\) cm\({}^{2}\)/ns] \\ \hline neutrons & \(4.1\pm 0.1\) & 6.0 \(\pm\) 0.2 \\ \hline pions & \(5.7\pm 0.2\) & \(7.7\pm 0.2\) \\ \hline protons & \(5.6\pm 0.2\) & \(7.7\pm 0.2\) \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}

duction band, respectively.

Temperature scaling of \(\beta_{e,h}\) dominated by a single trap can thus be written as:

\[\beta_{e,h}(T)\,=\,\frac{1}{\tau_{eff_{e,h}}\,\Phi_{\rm eq}}\,=\,\beta_{e,h}(T_{ o})\,\frac{1-P_{t}^{e\,h}(T)}{1-P_{t}^{e\,h}(T_{o})}\left(\frac{T}{T_{o}} \right)^{-m+\frac{1}{2}} \tag{8}\]

In order to study the dependence of effective trapping probability on temperature, measurements for all the diodes from Table 1 were performed in the temperature interval from 223 K to 293 K. The temperature range was constrained by practical limitations. For lower temperatures, fast drift, especially of electrons, rendered the experimental determination of \(\tau_{eff}\) questionable. And at higher temperatures, the resulting reverse current was to high to be properly handled by our experimental set-up.

The measured temperature dependence of average \(\beta_{e,h}\) for all three particle types is shown in Fig. 3 exhibiting a 20 - 30 % decrease of trapping probability over the temperature range covered. An examination of terms in Eq. 8 showed that such behavior could be caused either by a negative \(m\) in cross-section scaling, or by a near to mid-gap position of the trap, supported by an appropriately large \(c_{e}/c_{h}\) ratio, or a combination of the two effects. Therefore, an extraction of separate trap parameters was considered unjustified. An effective parameterization of the form

\[\beta_{e,h}(T)=\beta_{e,h}(T_{0})\cdot(\frac{T}{T_{0}})^{\kappa_{e,h}} \tag{9}\]

with \(\kappa_{e,h}\) universal for all particle types yielded acceptable fits (see Fig. 3) to all data. Fit results are listed in Table 3. This could indicate, that the same two traps, albeit introduced at different rates, play the dominant role in trapping induced by neutron and charged hadron irradiation.

### Annealing of effective trapping probability

With time, defects can either decay or interact with others to form new ones. The consequence of this is a change in effective trapping probability, covered by the annealing function \(f_{t}(t)\) in Eq. 3. Annealing of \(\beta_{e,h}\) was studied with two diodes from wafers W339 (standard, 15 k\(\Omega\)cm) and W317 (oxygenated, 15 k\(\Omega\)cm) irradiated with neutrons to 7.5 10\({}^{13}\) cm\({}^{-2}\). After the diodes reached the minimum in \(V_{F\,D}\) at room temperature, accelerated annealing was performed in steps at 60\({}^{\circ}\)C. Between annealing steps TCT measurements were done at \(T=10^{\circ}\)C. The diodes were mounted to the same Peltier temperature regulator to ensure equal temperature history.

Dependence of \(\beta_{e,h}\) on annealing time is shown in Fig. 4. It can be seen that, for both standard and oxygenated material, \(\beta_{e}\) at 10\({}^{\circ}\)C decreases with time after irradiation by about 35%, while \(\beta_{h}\) increases by about 30%. An elementary model assuming the decay of the dominant electron and hole trap into another stable one was evaluated and observed to describe the annealing data well. The relevant fit function was

\[\beta_{e,h}(t)\;=\;\beta_{0_{e,h}}\cdot e^{-\frac{t}{\tau_{e,h}}}\;+\;\beta_{ \infty_{e,h}}\cdot(1-e^{-\frac{t}{\tau_{e,h}}}) \tag{10}\]

Figure 4: Annealing of effective trapping probability at 60\({}^{\circ}\)C. Measurements were taken at \(T=10^{\circ}\)C.

with \(\beta_{0_{e,h}}\equiv\beta_{e,h}\) and \(\beta_{\infty_{e,h}}\) the trapping rates at early and late annealing times, respectively.

The results of the fits are gathered in Table 4. Parameters for standard and oxygenated samples exhibit the same behavior within the rather large uncertainties. Annealing times are of order of 10 hours at 60\({}^{\circ}\)C, about the same order of magnitude as characteristic times of reverse annealing. Although depending in detail on the activation energy, the effect of trapping probability annealing can thus be expected to play a rather marginal role in the lifetime of a typical LHC experiment.

After the last annealing step, temperature scans of both diodes were performed. The temperature scaling parameter \(\kappa_{e,h}\) (Table 5) of the effective trapping probability was found to be comparable with its value in the minimum of \(V_{FD}\) (Table 3) for holes, while for electrons its value increased nearly by a factor of two. As a consequence, the observed \(\beta_{e}\) decrease in fact turns into an increase at temperatures lower than -40\({}^{\circ}\)C.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|} \hline  & \(\beta_{0_{e}}\) & \(\beta_{\infty_{e}}\) & \(\beta_{0_{h}}\) & \(\beta_{\infty_{h}}\) & \(\tau_{e}\) & \(\tau_{h}\) \\  & \([10^{-16}\)\(\frac{\mathrm{cm}^{2}}{\mathrm{ns}}]\) & \([10^{-16}\)\(\frac{\mathrm{cm}^{2}}{\mathrm{ns}}]\) & \([10^{-16}\)\(\frac{\mathrm{cm}^{2}}{\mathrm{ns}}]\) & \([10^{-16}\)\(\frac{\mathrm{cm}^{2}}{\mathrm{ns}}]\) & \([\mathrm{hour}]\) & \([\mathrm{hour}]\) \\ \hline W339 & \(4.5\pm 0.2\) & \(2.8\pm 0.1\) & \(6.5\pm 0.3\) & \(7.9\pm 0.2\) & \(19\pm 5\) & \(4.2\pm 2.3\) \\ \hline W317 & \(4.2\pm 0.2\) & \(2.8\pm 0.1\) & \(5.4\pm 0.3\) & \(7.0\pm 0.2\) & \(10.6\pm 3.5\) & \(9.7\pm 4.5\) \\ \hline \end{tabular}

## 4 Conclusions

Several sets of diodes of different resistivities and oxygen content were irradiated with neutrons, pions and protons up to \(\Phi_{\rm eq}=2.4\times 10^{14}\) cm\({}^{-2}\). TCT measurements were performed as the irradiated diodes annealed to the minimum in \(V_{F\,D}\) at room temperature. Using the charge correction method the electron and hole effective trapping probabilities were determined for all diodes in the temperature range between 223 K and 293K.

The effective trapping probability was found to scale linearly with fluence and not to depend on oxygenation level and resistivity. Holes were observed to have higher trapping probability than electrons. Charge trapping is seen not to scale according to the NIEL hypothesis since charged hadrons induce 30-40 % more trapping than neutrons at the same NIEL equivalent fluence.

For both electrons and holes the effective trapping probability decreases with temperature by 20-30 % over the investigated \(-50\) to \(+20^{\circ}\)C temperature range. A power scaling law, universal in terms of particle type, was found to parameterize the data well.

Distinct annealing behavior of effective trapping probability for electrons and holes was observed. The electron effective trapping probability decreases by \(\sim 35\%\) while the hole effective trapping probability increases by \(\sim 30\%\). Time constants for these changes are of the order of 10 hours at \(60^{\circ}\)C.
