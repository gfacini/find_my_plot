Introduction

The complete X-ray tomograph [1] data of the full-scale prototype of a BOS MDT chamber constructed in February 1998 at MPI Munich [2] have been analyzed. The chamber has a tube length of 3800 mm and a width of 2160 mm, the largest chamber width in the barrel part of the ATLAS muon spectrometer. It contains 432 drift tubes, 72 in each of the 6 tube layers. The chamber has been constructed according to the procedures described in the Technical Design Report for the ATLAS muon spectrometer [3].

21 X-ray scans of the chamber have been performed at CERN. After analysis of the X-ray shadowgrams, the wire-coordinate data for 9 scans of the HV side of the chamber, 3 scans of the RO side and 3 scans of the middle part of the chamber have been made available for analysis on the X-ray tomograph web page.

The 9 scans of the HV side were performed in 4 different chamber orientations (see Figure 1):

* two scans (numbers 7 and 8 in the sequential scan numbering) in the initial orientation ("r1"),
* two scans (9 and 11) after rotation of the chamber by 180\({}^{o}\) around the x-axis (orientation "r2"),
* two scans (12 and 14) after rotation of the chamber by 180\({}^{o}\) around the y-axis with respect to orientation r2 (orientation "r3"),
* and three scans (15, 20 and 21) after rotation of the chamber by 180\({}^{o}\) around the x-axis with respect to orientation r3 (orientation "r4").

The three scans of the RO side are the following:

* one scan (10) in orientation r2,
* one scan (13) in orientation r3 and
* one scan (17) in orientation r4.

Out of the 432 wires of the chamber, 320-330 were reconstructed for the different scans. Measurement of the remaining wires was obscured by the long beams. No wire coordinates provided by the X-ray tomograph have been discarded in the analysis.

Analysis of the X-ray measurements allows to determine the geometrical parameters of the prototype chamber as well as the intrinsic resolution of the X-ray tomograph. Comparison of the wire coordinates measured by the X-ray tomograph with the measurements of wire positions in individual tubes before assembly of the chamber [2] gives information about the contributions of drift tube and chamber assembly to the mechanical accuracy of the chamber.

## 2 Comparison with the Ideal Wire Grid

The geometrical parameters of the chamber are determined by the assembly jigging, the combs and sphere towers, which are set up on a flat granite table and have been measured using 3D metrology (see [2]). Accordingly, the design parameters of the prototype chamber at 20\({}^{\circ}\) C are: \(y\)- and \(z\)-pitch on high voltage (HV) and readout (RO) side:

\[y\!-\!\mbox{pitch} = (26054\pm 10)\ \mu\mbox{m},\] \[z\!-\!\mbox{pitch} = (30036\pm 0.6)\ \mu\mbox{m};\]

\(z\)-shift an d \(y\)-separation (defined between the nearest wire planes) between the two multilayers (ML):

\[\Delta_{y}^{HV} = (347.040\pm 0.010)\ \mbox{mm}\ \ (\mbox{HV side}),\] \[\Delta_{y}^{RO} = (347.072\pm 0.010)\ \mbox{mm}\ \ (\mbox{RO side}),\] \[\Delta_{z}^{HV} = 0\ \mbox{mm}\ \ (\mbox{HV side}),\] \[\Delta_{z}^{RO} = 0\ \mbox{mm}\ \ (\mbox{RO side}).\]

The vertical \(y\)-pitch was intentionally increased by \((40\pm 10)\ \mu\mbox{m}\) compared to the nominal value of 26.011 mm for the construction of the prototype chamber to avoid touching of tube layers during glueing. On the readout side, the \(y\)-separation between multilayers is increased by a common offset of 32 \(\mu\)m of the wire positions in all drift tubes of the second multilayer known precisely from the X-ray measurements of wire positions in individual tubes (see [2]).

For the wide BOS chambers, correct compensation of the gravitational sag of the cross plates during glueing of each tube layer is an essential part of the assembly process. The sag of the outer cross plates of the prototype chamber was controlled with the force compensation system and optical cross plate sag monitors to be below 10 \(\mu\)m for each tube layer glued (see [2]).

The wire positions measured in the X-ray scans were fitted with an ideal grid with the expected geometrical parameters of the chamber. The \(y\)- and \(z\)-coordinate of the origin of the grid and the angular orientation of the grid around the \(x\)-axis with respect to the X-ray tomograph coordinate system are not relevant for the chamber accuracy and were treated as three free parameters in the fit.

The mechanical accuracy of the chamber can be characterised by the RMS widths of the residual distributions of the measured wire positions in \(y\) and \(z\) with respect to their nominal values. The results of the fit for the whole chamber and for each multilayer separately are shown in Table 1 for the scans on the high-voltage (HV) and on readout (RO) side and their averages.

The average RMS values are close to the specified 20 \(\mu\)m [3], but their variations from scan to scan are large. The value of \(RMS_{g}^{tot}\) varies from 19.4 \(\mu m\) up to 26.4 \(\mu m\) for the 9 scans of the HV side. This wide range of variation is not compatible with the expected X-ray tomograph resolution. Possible reasons for the large variations of the X-ray tomograph results have been investigated.

## 3 Chamber Deformations During X-Ray Measurements

Both from the readings of the RASNIK cross plate sag monitors (see [2]) and from the X-ray tomograph data, _global_ deformations of the high voltage and readout ends of the chamber were found which exceed the expectations from the Bessel support of the cross plates and which vary for the different orientations of the chamber in the tomograph (see Figures 2 and 3). The deformations observed can be described by a parabola. One concludes that the chamber in its different orientations was not supported free of external moments in the tomograph as required. For the evaluation of the accuracy of the chamber, the global deformations of the chamber ends in the tomograph setup have to be taken into account.

The fits of the measured wire coordinates with a grid were repeated with the same geometrical parameters as used for Table 1 but with a common parabolic sag of both multilayers as additional free parameter. As expected, the \(RMS_{y}\) values improve (see Table 2).

As expected from the data in Figures 2 and 3, the largest fitted sag of approximately 50 \(\mu\)m was found on the HV-side in orientation r1. Consequently, the most significant improvement of the RMS value of the \(y\)-residuals occurs for scans 7 and 8. Still the variations of the \(RMS_{y}\) values for the different scans are larger than expected: from 18.5 \(\mu\)m to 24.2 \(\mu\)m on the HV side and from 17.7 \(\mu\)m to 22.3 \(\mu\)m on the RO side.

The RMS values are also given separately for the two multilayers ML1 and ML2 numbered in the assembly sequence.

## 4 Reproducibility of the X-Ray Tomograph Measurements

In order to understand the variations in the results of the X-ray tomograph scans, the reproducibility of the measurements from repeated scans of the chamber in the same position has been evaluated. The differences between two subsequent measurements \(i\) and \(j\) in the same position, i.e. the mean and RMS of the distributions of the differences

\[\Delta y = \delta y_{i}-\delta y_{j}\;\;\mbox{and}\] \[\Delta z = \delta z_{i}-\delta z_{j}\]

of the residuals \(\delta y\) and \(\delta z\) of the wire coordinates with respect to the expected grid with sag (see previous section), are given in Table 3.

The RMS widths of the differences of the residuals of the wire coordinates vary considerably for the different chamber orientations in the tomograph. The average RMS widths are 4 \(\mu\)m for the \(z\)-coordinate and 7 \(\mu\)m for the \(y\)-coordinate in the multilayer which was on top during the scan. The reproducibility for the bottom multilayer is 1.5 times worse, 6 \(\mu\)m in \(z\) and 10 \(\mu\)m in \(y\), respectively, which can be explained by the larger multiple scattering of the X-rays. The ratio of the widths for the \(z\)- and for the \(y\)-coordinate is about 0.6 for both multilayers which is

The RMS values are also given separately for the two multilayers ML1 and ML2 numbered in the assembly sequence.

in agreement with the expected value of \(\tan 30^{\circ}=0.58\) due to the \(30^{\circ}\) inclination of the X-ray beams with respect to the the \(y\) axis.

The total widths for the whole chamber, \(RMS^{\rm tot}_{\Delta z}\simeq 6\mu\)m and \(RMS^{\rm tot}_{\Delta y}\simeq 11\mu\)m, differ from the average of the values for top and bottom multilayers, obviously due to systematic shifts of the measured wire coordinates in the two multilayers from one scan to the other.

Information about the origin of the systematic effects can be obtained by studying the differenc ce between repeated wire coordinate measurements as function of \(z\), i.e. along the scan direction. The differences of the \(y\)- and \(z\)-residuals for the two subsequent scans no. 7 and 8 in the same position of the chamber,

\[\Delta y=\delta y_{7}-\delta y_{8}\ \ {\rm and}\ \ \Delta z=\delta z_{7}-\delta z_{8},\]

are shown as a function of \(z\)-coordinate of the wires in Figure 4 (for the top multilayer) and Figure 5 (for the bottom multilayer).

Significant systematic effects are visible: large fluctuations near the locations of the long beams which absorb and scatter the X-rays, average offsets from zero and slopes in scan direction. The effects are studied further by projecting the \(y\)- and \(z\)-coordinates of the wires in the directions perpendicular to and measured directly by the two X-ray beams:

\[\Delta_{\rm left} = \cos(30^{\circ})\cdot\Delta z+\sin(30^{\circ})\cdot\Delta y,\] \[\Delta_{\rm right} = cos(30^{\circ})\cdot\Delta z-\sin(30^{\circ})\cdot\Delta y.\]

The variables \(\Delta_{\rm left}\) and \(\Delta_{\rm right}\) describe the reproducibility of the wire position measurements with respect to the directions of the left and right X-ray beam in scan direction, respectively.

Table 3: Reproducibility of the X-ray tomograph measurements: mean and RMS [\(\mu\)m] of the differences \(\Delta y\) and \(\Delta z\) of the residuals of the measured wire coordinates with respect to the expected grid with sag for two subsequent scans of the chamber on the high voltage side in the same position (top and bottom multilayer separately and combined)The \(z\)-dependence of the new variables is shown in Figure 6 for the top multilayer and in Figure 7 for the bottom multilayer.

The analysis leads to the following conclusions on the systematics of the X-ray measurements:

1. Large fluctuations are observed in both coordinates in the regions close to the shadows of the long-beams which have not been corrected.
2. The wire coordinates measured by the right X-ray beam are relatively stable along the scan direction with average offsets of \(\Delta_{\rm right}\) from zero of \(\thicksim-10\)\(\mu\)m for the top multilayer and \(\thicksim+10\)\(\mu\)m for the bottom multilayer. The offsets can be explained by a change of the right X-ray direction between the two scans.
3. The difference of the wire coordinates measured by the left X-ray beam show a systematic trend across the width of the chamber which can be explained by a drift of the direction of the left X-ray beam during one of the two scans.

Similar systematic effects were found in the comparison of the other repeated scans in the same position. They broaden the residual distributions of the measured wire coordinates and explain the large variations of \(RMS_{y}\) and \(RMS_{z}\) from scan to scan (see Table 2). In particular, they deteriorate the accuracy in the measurement of the multilayer separations in \(y\) and \(z\). According to Table 3, the reproducibility of the measurement of the multilayer separations

\[<\Delta y>^{\rm top}-<\Delta y>^{\rm bot}\ \ \ {\rm and}\ \ <\Delta z>^{\rm top}-<\Delta z>^{\rm bot}\]

varies in the range 1 to 22.4 \(\mu\)m for \(y\) and \(-11.2\) to \(-0.4\)\(\mu\)m for \(z\).

To get rid of the systematic uncertainties in the X-ray measurement of the multilayer separations in \(y\) and \(z\) and the \(y\)- and \(z\)-pitches for the evaluation of the chamber accuracy, these parameters have to be left free in the grid fit. The remaining uncertainty in the wire coordinate measurements is the intrinsic resolution of the X-ray tomograph which can be estimated from the reproducibility of repeated scans by dividing the average \(RMS_{\Delta y}\) and \(RMS_{\Delta z}\) in Table 3 by \(\sqrt{2}\) since both scans are affected by the measurement errors.

The \(y\)-resolution of the X-ray tomograph for the measurement of the BOS prototype chamber is therefore 5 \(\mu\) for the top multilayer and 7 \(\mu\)m for the bottom multilayer. The \(z\)-resolution is 3 \(\mu\)m and 4 \(\mu\)m, respectively, for the top and the bottom multilayer. The average X-ray tomograph resolutions for the whole chamber are

\[\sigma_{y}^{\rm 4\,mo} \simeq 6\ \ \ \mu{\rm m}\ \ {\rm and} \tag{1}\] \[\sigma_{z}^{\rm 4\,mo} \simeq 3.5\ \mu{\rm m}. \tag{2}\]

## 5 Global Fit of the Wire Grid

Given the mechanical tolerances of the jigging [2], [3] (see Table 5) and the systematic uncertainties of the X-ray tomograph measurements, the geometrical parameters and the accuracy of the chamber are best evaluated by fitting a wire grid to the wire coordinates measured in each scan with the \(y\)- and \(z\)-pitch, the \(y\)- and \(z\)-separation between multilayers and the common sagitta of all layers in \(y\)-direction as free parameters. The results for the different scans and their average are given in Table 4. Included are the rms widths of the residual distributions and their standard deviations (from fit of a Gaussian) which can be used to evaluate the overall accuracy of the chamber assembly. The wire coordinate errors contain a non-negligible contribution from the resolution of the X-ray tomograph (see previous section). The residual distributions for two typical scans are shown in Figures 8 and 9.

The design values for the \(y\)- and \(z\)-pitch and the \(y\)- and \(z\)-separations between the multilayers (see [2]) from measurement of the assembly jigging, are well reproduced by the averaged X-ray tomograph results within the measurement errors (see Table 5). The measured \(y\)- and \(z\)-separations between multilayers vary considerably from scan to scan indicating the intrinsic systematic errors of the X-ray measurements. The small variations in the average \(z\)-pitch from scan to scan may have been caused by temperature variations of the chamber in the X-ray tomograph.

Table 4: Results from the global fit of a wire grid to the data from the X-ray tomograph scans on the high voltage (HV) and readout (RO) side and at intermediate \(x\)-positions (see Figure 1). Repeated scans for the same chamber orientation are grouped together. For the different scans, the average sagitta of all layers, \(y\)- and \(z\)-pitch and the separations \(\Delta_{y}\) and \(\Delta_{z}\) between multilayers are determined as parameters in the fit. The RMS widths and standard deviations (from fit of a Gaussian) of the residual distributions in \(y\) and \(z\) are also shown.

## 6 Uniformity of Tube Layers

For each individual tube layer the \(y\)-residuals of the wires with respect to the gobal fit were fitted with a parabola

\[\delta y(z)=a_{y}+b_{y}\cdot z+c_{y}\cdot z^{2}\]

and the \(z\)-residuals with a a straight line

\[\delta z(z)=a_{z}+b_{z}\cdot z.\]

The average values of the parameters \(a_{y}\), \(b_{y}\), \(c_{y}\), \(a_{z}\) and \(b_{z}\) for all scans as well as the average shifts \(<\delta y>\) and \(<\delta z>=a_{z}\) and the spreads \(RMS_{\delta y}\) and \(RMS_{\delta z}\) with respect to the fitted grid are shown for each tube layer in Table 6. The parameters are given in the chamber coordinate frame for the initial orientation rl (see Figure 1) with the \(y\)-axis pointing upwards and the \(z\)-axis in scan direction. They allow to evaluate the uniformity of the chamber parameters for all layers.

With the chamber width \(W=2160\) mm, the sagitta of the tube layers after subtraction of the common sag on the supports in the X-ray tomograph is \(c_{y}\cdot(W/2)^{2}\). Beyond the common sag, there are no deformations of individual tube layers significantly above the specification for the cross plate sag compensation.

Tables 7 and 8 show the averaged measured geometrical parameters of individual tube layers, \(z\)-pitch, \(z\)-shift and average \(y\)-separation. The \(z\)-pitch of a layer is given by \(\delta z_{0}[\mu\mathrm{m}]+b_{z}\cdot\delta z_{0}[\mathrm{m}]\) where \(\delta z_{0}\) is the average global \(z\)-pitch of the chamber. The uniformity of the chamber parameters is very good with respect to the tolerances of the assembly tooling which fulfill the specifications.

The only significant deviations from the design parameters of the chamber are global \(z\)-shifts of \(+16\)\(\mu\)m and \(-19\)\(\mu\)m of the two outer tube layers with respect to the fitted grid, in the first multilayer on the HV side and in the second multilayer on the RO side. The same sphere tower interface is responsible for \(z\)-positioning in both cases and the two shifts point in the same direction in the coordinate frame of the assembly jigging. The \(z\)-shifts are the reason for the larger RMS values for the \(z\)- compared to the \(y\)-coordinate. The foreseen optical sphere monitors allow to detect such shifts if they should occur during series production.

## 7 Intermediate Scans

For chamber orientation r4, three successful scans have been performed at intermediate \(x\)-positions between the chamber ends (see Figure 1). The chamber parameters from the global fits to these data are given in Table 4. The RMS widths of the residual distributions for the top and bottom multilayer during the scans separately and combined are shown in Figures 10-12 and in Table 9 as function of \(x\).

The wire positions measured at intermediate \(x\)-positions between the chambers ends (see Figure 1) show a smaller spread than at the HV and RO ends (see Table 9) because they are determined by interpolation between both ends and by the wire sag. Fluctuations in the wire sag of 2 \(\mu\)m RMS due to the variations of the measured wire tension within 1% RMS (see [2]) can be neglected. The expected widths of the residual distributions as function of \(x\) are therefore determined by

where \(L=3800\) mm is the length of the tubes.

The results in Table 9 show that the measured values of \(\sigma_{y,z}\) at intermediate \(x\)-positions are always larger than predicted from equation (3). A possible source of this discrepancy is the contribution of the X-ray measurement errors \(\sigma^{\rm tomo}_{y,z}\) which do not interpolate. To account for this effect, the error propagation has to be modified:

\[\sigma^{\rm res}_{y,z}(x)=\sqrt{\left(\frac{x}{L}\right)^{2}(\sigma^{\rm res\,2 }_{y,z}(RO)-\sigma^{\rm tomo\,2}_{y,z})+\left(\frac{x}{L}-1\right)^{2}(\sigma^ {\rm res\,2}_{y,z}(HV)-\sigma^{\rm tomo\,2}_{y,z})}\ \oplus\ \sigma^{\rm tomo}_{y,z}. \tag{4}\]

The predictions for the X-ray tomograph measurement errors which describe the RMS values of the data with equation (4) are given in Table 9. These predictions are higher than the estimates from the reproducibility of repeated scans, especially for the \(z\)-coordinate.

## 8 Comparison with X-ray Data for Individual Tubes

In Figures 13 and 14, the residuals (with respect to the fitted grid) of the \(y\)-coordinates of the wires from X-ray tomograph scans on the RO side are plotted against the \(y\)-displacements of the wires from the center of individual drift tubes measured with X-rays before chamber assembly (see [2]). Similar correlations exist for the \(z\)-coordinate.

The expected correlations between the two wire coordinate measurements are obvious, independent of the orientation of the chamber during the X-ray tomograph scans. Using a simple model with Gaussian errors, this information can be used to roughly disentangle and estimate the different contributions to the total uncertainty in the wire coordinates:

Table 9: RMS widths of the residual distributions for 5 scans at different positions along the tubes in the same orientation of the chamber (see Figure 1). The expectations according to equation (3) from interpolation of the wire locations between the fixed ends and the predicted X-ray tomograph resolutions \(\sigma_{y,z}^{\rm tomo}\) are also shown.

1. The positioning accuracy \(\sigma^{\rm wire}\) of the wires inside individual drift tubes.
2. The resolution \(\sigma^{\rm X-ray}\) of the X-ray measurements of individual drift tubes.
3. The positioning accuracy \(\sigma^{\rm tube}\) of drift tubes in the chamber.
4. The average resolution \(\sigma^{\rm tomo}\) of the X-ray tomograph measurements.

Since the four types of errors are statistically in dependent, they add quadratically to give the widths \(\sigma^{\rm res}\), \(\sigma^{\rm disp}\) and \(\sigma^{\rm diff}\) of the distributions of the measured parameters shown in Figures 15 and 16, the residuals of the wire coordinates from the X-ray tomograph, the wire displacements measured in the individual drift tubes and the difference of the two correlated variables:

\[\sigma^{\rm res} = \sigma^{\rm wire}\oplus\sigma^{\rm tube}\oplus\sigma^{\rm tomo}, \tag{5}\] \[\sigma^{\rm disp} = \sigma^{\rm wire}\oplus\sigma^{\rm X-ray},\] (6) \[\sigma^{\rm diff} = \sigma^{\rm tube}\oplus\sigma^{\rm X-ray}\oplus\sigma^{\rm tomo}. \tag{7}\]

The average resolution \(\sigma^{\rm tomo}\) of the X-ray tomograph over all chamber orientations has been estimated in section 4, equations (1) and (2). Therefore, the three equations (5)-(7) allow to determine the three unknown errors \(\sigma^{\rm wire}\), \(\sigma^{\rm tube}\) and \(\sigma^{\rm X-ray}\). The standard deviations (from fit of a Gaussian) of the measured distributions, \(\sigma^{\rm res}\) averaged over the scans, \(\sigma^{\rm disp}\) and \(\sigma^{\rm diff}\) (compare Figures 15 and 16 for two scans), and the values for \(\sigma^{\rm wire}\), \(\sigma^{\rm tube}\) and \(\sigma^{\rm X-ray}\) calculated from them are given in Table 10 separately for the HV and RO side and the two multilayers numbered in the sequence of assembly.

The expection of larger \(z\)-positioning errors \(\sigma^{\rm tube}_{z}\) on the HV side of multilayer 1 and on the RO side of multilayer 2 due to global \(z\)-shifts of the two outer tube layers (see section 6) is reproduced by the results.

## 9 Bad Wire Coordinates

Tails of the distributions of the residuals of the wire coordinates are caused by a few wire coordinates far away from the fitted grid. During drift tube testing and chamber assembly it was verified that such large deviations did not occur (see [2]). Therefore these wires most likely have been wrongly measured by the X-ray tomograph. They have, however, not been removed from the data sample for the grid fits. They are partly responsible for the rather large variations in the X-ray tomograph resolution for different chamber orientations (see section 4 and Table 3.

To estimate the effect of the "bad" wire coordinates on the RMS widths of the residual distributions, they have been fitted with a Gaussian and \(\pm 3\sigma\)- and \(\pm 2\sigma\)-cuts were applied which typically rejected 2% and 10% of the wires, respectively. The \(RMS\) values of the residual distributions after the cuts are shown in Table 11.

## 10 Conclusions

The complete X-ray tomograph data of the BOS prototype chamber have been analyzed. The results lead to the following conclusions:

1. From repeated scans of the chamber in the same position, the reproducibility and intrinsic accuracy of the X-ray tomograph measurements has been evaluated. On top of the systematic variations in the X-ray measurements of the geometrical chamber parameters (minimised by averaging over all scans), the average intrinsic resolution of the X-ray tomograph was estimated to be 6 \(\mu\)m rms for the \(y\) coordinate and 4 \(\mu\)m rms in \(z\) from the reproducibility of the measurements of the BOS prototype chamber.
2. The geometrical parameters of the prototype chamber are determined by fitting a wire grid to the measured wire coordinates with \(y\)- and \(z\)-pitch, multilayer (ML) separations in \(y\) and \(z\) and the global cross plate sag in the X-ray tomograph supports as free parameters.

Table 11: RMS values and standard deviations \(\sigma\) (from fit of a Gaussian) of the residual distributions for the global fit to the X-ray tomograph measurements (average of all scans) before and after elimination of outlying wire coordinate measurements (in [\(\mu\)m]).

After averaging over all scans, the chamber parameters and the RMS widths of the residual distributions for high voltage and readout side are the following (without cut against outlying wire coordinate measurements): 

The fitted parameters are in good agreement with the design values (at 20\({}^{\circ}\)C); uncertainties in the wire locations are below the required 20 \(\mu\)m rms. The design parameters of the prototype chamber (at 20\({}^{\circ}\)C) determined by the assembly jigging are well reproduced by the X-ray tomograph data within the measurement errors. The wires have been positioned in the whole chamber with an accuracy which is better than the required 20 \(\mu\)m RMS.
3. A further important achievement for the validation of the chamber assembly procedure is the good uniformity of the \(z\)-pitch and of the \(y\)-separation of all tube layers. The only significant deviations from the design parameters of the chamber are global shifts in \(z\) of the two outer tube layers by \(+16\)\(\mu\)m and \(-19\)\(\mu\)m, respectively, with respect to the fitted grid, layer 3 in the assembly sequence on the high-voltage side and layer 6 on the readout side. The two shifts of equal size and same direction in the coordinate frame of the assembly jigging can be attributed to the same sphere tower interface being outside tolerances in the \(z\)-displacement of \(\pm 10\mu\)m. Because of the \(z\)-shifts, the RMS width for the \(z\)-coordinate is larger than for \(y\) in spite of the uniform \(z\)-pitch.
4. Both with the cross plate sag monitors and from the X-ray tomograph data, global gravitational sags of the high voltage and readout ends of the prototype chamber were found which are larger than expected from the Bessel support of the cross plates and which vary from scan to scan. Obviously the chamber was not supported free of external moments in the tomograph. Kinematical mounts as in ATLAS should be used to support the chambers for the X-ray tomograph measurements. To evaluate the accuracy of the chamber construction, it is necessary to take the global deformation into account by fitting a common parabola for all layers. Beyond this global correction, no systematic deformations of individual tube layers were found.
