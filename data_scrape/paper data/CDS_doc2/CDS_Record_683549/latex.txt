## 1 Introduction.

This paper describes the analysis part of a design concept study into the ATLAS Central Muon System. The results of similar works made in the University of Washington (Seattle)(1) and NIKHEF (Amsterdam) was allowed for in this work.

Four variants of the BIL Muon Chamber design was considered. The difference between these variants is the difference between methods of the drift tubes redundant deflection compensation. In the first and third variants (first variant was proposed by NIKHEF) the compensation carried out by eccentric compression of longbeam (Figure 1). Second and fourth variant are based on generation of turning moment on the chamber ends (Figure 1). In all cases in the spacer design thin plates were used to compensate temperature deformations.

Three variants of the temperature loading were considered. In the first variant the temperature (3 degree C) was applied to upper or lower multilayer. In the second variant the temperature (+ or -1.5 degree C) was applied to upper and lower multilayers correspondingly. At last, in the third variant the temperature (3 degree C) was applied to one of the outer layer of the multilayers. We increased the number of the temperature loading variants as compared with that number described in the reference (1), because we consider that most strong influence on the chamber deformation will occur, when temperature will be apply to one of the outer layer of the multilayers. The basis for this assumption is anomalously low multilayer thermal conductivity in the direction of the normal to the multilayer plain.

## 2 Finite Element Model.

2-D (X-Y axes) model based on the current geometry being proposed for the BIL Muon Chamber was used. The symmetry of the model was exploited in that only a half of the Chamber was modelled. The values of the Chamber geometry parameters, such as area, moment of inertia, etc., were reduced to 1/32 of Chamber width (Z direction).

The element types used were:

* STIF1 (2 nodes Spar) to model Chamber attachment to the stationary support (bracer #1) and spring elements between outer cross plate and temperature compensator;
* STIF3 (2 nodes Elastic Beam) to model the drift tubes, longbeam and bracers between outer cross plate and temperature compensator (bracer #2);
* STIF12 (2 node Interface) to model the gap between outer cross plate and temperature compensator;
* STIF42 (4 node Isoparametric Solid) to model outer cross plate and longbeam.

## 3 Calculation Conditions.

### Material properties.

The general material used in the Chamber design were Aluminium alloy, but some model elements have properties, which differ from Aluminium alloy properties. This was made to compensate differences between 2-D and 3-D models. The material properties for the different model elements are shown in the Table 2.

Table 1:

### Loading.

Several series of the calculations were carried out for the different load cases. In all cases the gravity loading was applied. The different cases of the temperature (in degrees Celsius) loading applying are shown in the tables for each series of the calculations.

The first series of the calculations were carried out for the only drift tubes multilayer (Figure 1, variant #0) to get basis value of the deflections and stresses. The temperature loading was applied in correspondence with Table 3.

### 3.2 Loading.

Several series of the calculations were carried out for the different load cases. In all cases the gravity loading was applied. The different cases of the temperature (in degrees Celsius) loading applying are shown in the tables for each series of the calculations.

The first series of the calculations were carried out for the only drift tubes multilayer (Figure 1, variant #0) to get basis value of the deflections and stresses. The temperature loading was applied in correspondence with Table 3.

Where:

**Tu** is a temperature of upper layer;

**Tl** is a temperature of lower layer.

The second, third, fourth and fifth series of the calculations were carried out for the first, second, third and fourth variant of the Muon Chamber design correspondingly (Figure 1). In all cases the temperature loading was applied in correspondence with Table 4.

Where:

**Tu** is a temperature of upper multilayer;

**Tl** is a temperature of upper layer of lower multilayer;

**Til** is a temperature of lower layer of lower multilayer.

## 4 Analysis plan.

The analysis was made in the following sequence:

* The calculations for each variant of the design without applying of redundant drift tubes deflection compensation forces were carried out;
* The drift tubes redundant deflection compensation forces were evaluated1;

Footnote 1: Because the values of the Chamber geometry parameters were reduced to 1/32 of Chamber width, the value of the drift tubes deflection compensation force must be multiplied by 32 to obtain force value for the whole Chamber.

* The series of the calculations with temperature loading were carried out. By result of these calculations maximal vertical displacement of drift tubes and maximal stresses in the spacer and in the glue joint between drift tubes were evaluated2. During these calculations the gap between outer cross plate and temperature compensator was evaluated too.

Footnote 2: Because Youngâ€™s modulus value for glue less than one for aluminium alloy, we estimated the stresses in the glue joint between drift tubes as stresses on the drift tubes surface

## 5 Results.

The general view of the different variants of the deflected BIL Muon Chamber is shown in Figure 2.

## 6 Discussion of calculations results.

### Vertical displacement.

As it could see from the diagram the temperature loading render strongly negative influence on the chamber deflection for all variants of the chamber design. However, it is necessary to remember, that magnitude of the temperature loading has not sufficient justification. Therefore before inference making, it is necessary to carry out more exactly definition of the temperature loading.

### Stresses.

The magnitude of the stresses (as for spacer so for glue joint) is quite small for all variants of the chamber design.

### Design variants.

As it follows from the calculation results, the second variant of the chamber design (Figure 1) looks more preferably. The influence of the temperature loading on the Chamberdeflection for this variant no more strong, than for any other variant, but second variant of the chamber design is more simple, than other and, consequently, less expensive.

**7. Conclusion.**

\(\bullet\) the temperature loading render strong influence on the chamber deflection;

\(\bullet\) it is necessary to carry out more exactly definition of the temperature loading;

\(\bullet\) the second variant of the chamber design looks more preferably for this stage of chamber design analysis.

## Abstract.

The ATLAS Barrel Inner Large (BIL) Muon Chamber design concept based on Finite Element Analysis (FEA) is presented. The Finite Element program used in this analysis was ANSYS 4.4.

All questions and notes address to: **baliev @mx.ihep.su**

## 1 Introduction.

This paper describes the analysis part of a design concept study into the ATLAS Central Muon System.

The goal of this work is :

* the study of the influence of the device for the longitudinal decoupling of the Muon Chamber and stationary support on the drift tubes maximal vertical displacement value (Decoupling problem);
* Elaborate on the influence of temperature loading on the drift tubes maximal vertical displacement value (Temperature problem).

## 2 Decoupling problem.

The general view of the decoupling device is shown in the Figure 1.

The problem was studied for variant #3 of the Muon Chamber calculation schemes (ref.1, fig.1) with only difference, that in a given case the symmetry of the model was not exploited (because decoupling device is unsymmetry factor), in that the Chamber was modelled completely (Figure 2). The values of the Chamber geometry parameters, such as area, moment of inertia, etc., were reduced to 1/32 of Chamber width (Z direction).

Figure 1:The decoupling device was modelled as ANSYS two nodes Elastic Beam (STIF3 element type).

The calculations were carried out for the different loading cases. In all cases the gravity loading was applied. The different cases of the temperature (in degrees Celsius) loading applying are shown in the Table 1.

**Table 1.**

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|} \hline
**Loading case** & **Tu** & **Tl** & **Tuu** & **Tul** & **Tlu** & **Tll** \\ \hline
**1** & - & - & - & - & - & - \\ \hline
**2** & -1.5 & 1.5 & - & - & - & - \\ \hline
**3** & 1.5 & -1.5 & - & - & - & - \\ \hline
**4** & 3 & - & - & - & - & - \\ \hline
**5** & - & 3 & - & - & - & - \\ \hline
**6** & - & - & 3 & - & - & - \\ \hline
**7** & - & - & - & 3 & - & - \\ \hline
**8** & - & - & - & - & 3 & - \\ \hline
**9** & - & - & - & - & - & 3 \\ \hline \end{tabular}

Where:

**Tu** is a temperature of upper multilayer;

**Tl** is a temperature of lower multilayer;

**Tuu** is a temperature of upper layer of upper multilayer;

**Tul** is a temperature of upper layer of lower multilayer;

**Tlu** is a temperature of lower layer of upper multilayer;

**Tll** is a temperature of lower layer of lower multilayer.

The analysis was made in the following sequence:

\(\bullet\) The calculations for each variant of the design without applying of the drift tubes redundant deflection compensation forces were carried out.

\(\bullet\) The drift tubes redundant deflection compensation forces were evaluated3;

Footnote 3: Because the values of the Chamber geometry parameters were reduced to 1/32 of Chamber width, the value of the drift tubes deflection compensation force must be multiplied by 32 to obtain force value for the whole Chamber.

Figure 2:

The series of the calculations with temperature loading were carried out. By result of these calculations maximal vertical displacement of drift tubes were evaluated.

The general view of the deflected BIL Muon Chamber is shown in Figure 3.

**Figure 3.**By result of the calculation of the BIL Muon Chamber design without applying of the drift tubes redundant deflection correction forces, following value were obtained (Table 2).

In Table 3 and in Figure 4, the results of the calculations with the different temperature loading are shown. Shaded cells in the table contain values of the vertical displacements, which are inside the allowable interval.

**Table 3.**

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|} \hline
**Loading case** & **Max vertical** \\
**number** & **displacement, \(\underline{\mathbf{\mu}}\)m** \\ \hline
**1** & 110 \\ \hline
**2** & **121** \\ \hline
**3** & **99** \\ \hline
**4** & **131** \\ \hline
**5** & 138 \\ \hline
**6** & 161 \\ \hline
**7** & 373 \\ \hline
**8** & 164 \\ \hline
**9** & 378 \\ \hline \end{tabular}

As it could see by compare the calculation results obtained for the variant #3 in reference 1 and the results described in this paper, the decoupling device does not have large influence on the drift tubes maximal vertical displacement value.

## 3 Temperature problem.

As it following from the results in reference 1, the most value of the maximal vertical displacement was obtained when temperature was applied to the lower layer of the such of the multilayers. However, the temperature applying to only one layer is too rough model of the temperature loading. To obtain more real results we used the temperature distribution in correspondence with Table 4.

**Table 4.**As it could see from the table, the temperature gradient direction agrees with one for most value of the maximal vertical displacement (ref 1). By result of the calculation with that temperature distribution the maximal vertical displacement value was obtained4. This value is equal to 294 \(\upmu\)m (the allowable interval is from 85 \(\upmu\)m to 135 \(\upmu\)m). As it could see from comparison of this result and result of the similar calculation in the reference 1, the smooth temperature distribution in the layers of the Chamber causes to the large (\(\sim\)80 \(\upmu\)m) reduction of the drift tubes maximal vertical displacement value.

Footnote 4: The calculation was carried out for scheme are shown in Figure 2.

Additionally calculation of the maximal temperature (with temperature distribution similar like is shown in Table 4) when the maximal vertical displacement value will stay in the limit of the allowable interval, was carried out. This temperature is equal to 0.4\({}^{\circ}\)C.

## 3 Conclusion.

* The decoupling device does not have large influence on the drift tubes maximal vertical displacement value;
* The smooth temperature distribution in the layers of the Chamber causes to the large reduction of the drift tubes maximal vertical displacement value;
* The maximal temperature when the maximal vertical displacement value will stay in the limit of the allowable interval is equal to 0.4\({}^{\circ}\)C.
