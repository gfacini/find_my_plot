###### Abstract

The LHC (Large Hadron Collider) at CERN will allow the study of proton-proton collisions at very high energy (\(\sqrt{s}=16\) TeV). For a heavy Higgs, or in absence of any Higgs particle (\(m_{H}>1\) TeV), the \(W_{L}W_{L}\) scattering will be strong, leading to \(W\)-pairs in excess of backgrounds and can serve as a probe of the electroweak symmetry-breaking sector. The observation of like-charged \(W\) pairs in the process \(pp\to W^{+}W^{+}X\to l^{+}\nu l^{+}\nu\), (\(l=e,\mu\)) was studied. The \(W\)'s are produced from the scattering of longitudinally polarized W bosons (\(W_{L}^{+}W_{L}^{+}\to W_{L}^{+}W_{L}^{+}\)) at \(\sqrt{s}\sim 0\) (TeV). The backgrounds from gluon exchange, \(Wtt\) production, and \(W_{T}^{+}W_{T}^{+}\) production from \(W\) bremsstrahlung diagrams and SM processes, were considered. The PYTHIA Monte Carlo generator was used and the simulation takes into account the acceptance of the ATLAS detector: angular coverage, energy resolution of electromagnetic and hadronic calorimeters, electron identification and resolution for muons. The cases where \(m_{H}=1.0\) and \(0.5\) TeV were studied. The analysis of the distributions in cross section permits to apply specific cuts on jet and lepton variables and therefore, to enhance the signal/background ratio.

**1. Introduction**

All of the established experimental results seem to validate the Standard Model (SM) as the model correctly describing particle physics phenomena at present energies. For instance, detailed tests of the SM, at the 1% percent level, have been provided by LEP experiments. Despite its impressive success, the SM does not appear as being the ultimate theory since it leaves unanswered a number of fundamental questions. Among these, are the questions of the origin of mass, flavours, CP violation and finally of the unification of all known interactions into a single fundamental force of nature. The possible manifestation of new phenomena in the TeV energy range will provide key elements, contributing an answer to part or to all of these questions. In particular, the LHC energy regime allows to address the problem of the mass origin which is at the core of the formulation of the SM. In the SM, the introduction of a scalar field doublet spontaneously breaks the \(SU(2)_{L}\times U(1)\) symmetry via the Higgs mechanism and a mass is generated for the weak bosons, leaving the photon massless. A massive scalar particle is then predicted, the Higgs boson \(H\). Its mass is unpredicted by the SM. However, an upper limit of \(\sim 1\) TeV can be advocated for the Higgs mass\((m_{H})\) in order to preserve the unitarity of the theory. Results from LEP experiments allow to impose the lower limit \(m_{H}>\)60 GeV and it is hoped that LEP in its phase II will permit to extend this lower limit up to about 80 GeV.

Search for a Higgs particle with higher mass, up to O(TeV), will be conducted at the LHC with a center of mass energy of 16 TeV and an expected luminosity of \(10^{34}cm^{-2}sec^{-1}\).

The longitudinal polarization of \(W\) is a direct consequence of the Higgs mechanism. If the Higgs is very massive, \(m_{H}>2m_{W}\), the \(W_{L}W_{L}\) scattering of longitudinally polarized \(W\)'s, becomes important and yields a strong production of \(W\) pairs in excess over the background generated by standard processes. The dominance of the \(H\to W_{L}W_{L}\) coupling over the \(H\to W_{T}W_{T}\) coupling, gives special interest to the \(W_{L}W_{L}\) scattering cross section as predicted by the SM. Any deviation from this prediction seen by a measurement of the cross section would provide important informations on possible new physics implied by the symmetry breaking and furthermore, on the nature of the dynamical processes at work if the Higgs particle is not observed.

The present paper reports a study of the symmetry-breaking of the SM through the process \(pp\to W^{+}W^{+}X\) where the \(W^{+}\) pair is produced by the scattering of longitudinally polarized \(W\) bosons (\(W_{L}^{+}W_{L}^{+}\to W_{L}^{+}W_{L}^{+}\)). The identification of the two \(W^{+}\) charges, is accomplished by considering the leptonic decay mode of the \(W\): \(pp\to W^{+}W^{+}X\to l^{+}\nu l^{+}\nu\) (\(\rm l=e,\,\mu\)). This study takes into account the acceptance of the ATLAS detector: angular coverage, energy resolution of electromagnetic and hadronic calorimeters, electron identification and resolution for muons. The cross section is small \(\sim\) O(fb). The background cross section is of the same order. However, the analysis of the distributions in cross section allows to apply specific cuts on jet and lepton variables resulting in the enhancement of the signal/background ratio.

Similar work has been done previously for the production of \(W^{+}W^{-}\), \(W^{\pm}Z^{0}\), \(Z^{0}Z^{0}\) and \(Z^{0}\gamma\) under the assumption of resonant scattering. However, although their cross section is higher, these channels suffer from severe backgrounds provided by \(q\bar{q}\) annihilation and \(gg\) fusion that are totally absent for the \(W_{L}^{+}W_{L}^{+}\) signal, since they do not produce a +2-charged state.

## 2 The \(W^{+}W^{+}\) production and backgrounds

The Feynman diagrams, to the \(\alpha^{4}\) order, describing the \(W^{+}W^{+}\) pair production are shown in fig. 1. The calculation of this production can be made either exactly or using the effective W boson approximation (EWA) [1].

### Exact calculation

An exact calculation, including all the Feynman diagrams (a)-(m) of fig. 1, can be performed by using the helicity amplitude methods [2]. It accounts for all the polarization states of \(W^{+}\)'s. An estimate of the importance of the \(W_{T}^{+}W_{T}^{+}\) production is obtained by using a small mass \(m_{H}\approx\)100 GeV. For \(m_{H}\leq 100\) GeV, the \(O(\alpha^{2})\) background is independent of the value of \(m_{H}\) to a very good approximation and consists of \(W_{T}W_{T}\) and \(W_{T}W_{L}\) pairs with only a negligible quantity of \(W_{L}W_{L}\) pairs. Furthermore, the cross section for \(W_{T}W_{T}+W_{T}W_{L}\) pairs remains in dependent of \(m_{H}\), even as \(m_{H}\) is increased into the strong scattering domain, \(m_{H}\sim O(1)\) TeV [3]. The \(pp\to W^{+}W^{+}X\)cross section is calculated via the standard equation:

\[\sigma(pp\to W^{+}W^{+}X)=\int dX_{1}dX_{2}f_{p_{*}-q_{1}}(X_{1})f_{p_{*}-q_{2}}(X _{2})\times\hat{\sigma} \tag{1}\]

where \(f_{p_{*}-q_{1}}(X_{1})\) (\(f_{p_{*}-q_{2}}(X_{2})\) is the probability to find the quark \(q_{1}\) (\(q_{2}\)) with a fraction \(X_{1}\) (\(X_{2}\)) of the proton a (b) initial momentum; \(\hat{\sigma}\) is the \(q_{1}q_{2}\to W^{+}W^{+}q_{3}q_{4}\) scattering cross section in the \(q_{1}q_{2}\) c. of m. system.

### The effective \(W\) boson approximation (EWA)

The quark and gluon sea, at these energies, also contains \(W\) and \(Z\) bosons. Therefore, \(W\) and \(Z\) may be considered as quark constituents. It is, then, possible to define \(W\) boson beams. At LHC energy, the \(W\)'s may be considered on their mass shell and their energy distributions can then be calculated in an "effective-W approximation" (EWA) [1] analogous to the Weizsacker-Williams approximation for photons

In that approximation, the Feynman diagrams in fig. 1, (a), (b), and (c), representing the \(W^{+}W^{+}\) scattering, are gauge independent. Neglect of the diagrams (d) to (m) in fig. 1, which correspond to the bremsstrahlung of a \(W\) pair, imposes a restriction to central rapidity domains (\(|y_{W}|<1.5\)). The cross section is given by:

\[\sigma(q_{1}q_{2}\to q_{3}q_{4}W_{3}W_{4})=\sum_{\alpha,\beta}\int dX_{1}\,dX_ {2}f^{\alpha}_{W_{1}/q_{1}}(X_{1})f^{\beta}_{W_{2}/q_{2}}(X_{2})\times\hat{ \sigma}(W^{\alpha}_{1}W^{\beta}_{2}\to W_{3}W_{4}) \tag{2}\]

where \(f^{\alpha}_{W_{1}/q_{1}}(X_{1})\) represents the probability to find a boson \(W_{1}\), with a polarization \(\alpha\) (\(\alpha=\pm\), L), in the quark \(q_{1}\) and \(X_{1}=(q_{1}^{0}-q_{2}^{0})/q_{1}^{0}\) is the fraction of the quark \(q_{1}\) momentum carried away by \(W_{1}\). The probability functions for the various helicity states are given by:

\[f^{+}_{W/q}(X)=\frac{g^{2}}{32\pi^{2}X}ln(\frac{4E_{W}^{2}}{m_{W}^{2}})\]

\[f^{-}_{W/q}(X)=\frac{g^{2}}{32\pi^{2}X}(1-X^{2})ln(\frac{4E_{W}^{2}}{m_{W}^{2 }})\]

\[f^{L}_{W/q}(X)=\frac{g^{2}}{16\pi^{2}X}(1-X)\]

### The \(W^{+}_{l}w^{+}_{l}\) scattering in the SM

The Feynman diagrams describing the \(W^{+}W^{+}\) scattering are shown in fig. 2.

The diagram (a), implying the exchange of a heavy Higgs, contributes to a large \(W^{+}_{L}W^{+}_{L}\) production. The amplitudes for the three diagrams contributing to the scattering amplitude \(W^{+}_{L}(k_{1})W^{+}_{L}(k_{2})\to W^{+}_{L}(k_{3})W^{+}_{L}(k_{4})\) are given by [2]:

\[-i{\cal M}^{a}=-\frac{g^{2}s^{2}}{16m_{W}^{2}}\frac{(\beta^{\,2}-1-2t/s\beta^{ \,2})^{2}}{t-m_{H}^{2}}\]

\[-i{\cal M}^{b}=-\frac{g^{2}s^{2}}{4m_{W}^{4}}(\beta^{\,2}+\frac{2tu}{s^{2} \beta^{4}})\]

\[-i{\cal M}^{c}=\,{\cal M}^{I}+{\cal M}^{II}\]where

\[{\cal M}^{I}=-\,\frac{g^{2}s^{3}}{m_{W}^{4}}(\frac{1-X_{W}}{t-m_{Z}^{2}}+\frac{X_{W }}{t})\frac{1}{16}(\beta^{\,2}-1-\frac{2t}{s\beta^{\,2}})^{2}(1+\beta^{\,2}+ \frac{t}{s})\]

and

\[{\cal M}^{II}=\frac{t}{2s}(\beta^{\,2}-1-\frac{2t}{s\beta^{\,2}})(2+\frac{t}{s \beta^{\,2}})+\frac{t^{2}}{s^{\,2}\beta^{\,2}}(1+\beta^{\,2}+\frac{t}{s\beta^{ \,2}})\]

where \(\beta^{\,2}=1-4m_{W}^{2}/s\), \(X_{W}=sin^{\,2}(\theta_{W})\), \(s=(k_{1}+k_{2})^{\,2}\), \(t=(k_{1}-k_{3})^{\,2}\), and \(u=(k_{1}-k_{4})^{\,2}\). These equations are used in the PYTHIA generator. Only the polarization vector \(\epsilon^{\mu}(L)\) has been used since only the \(W_{L}^{+}W_{L}^{+}\) scattering is calculated. The transverse and longitudinal polarization vectors of a real W moving in the positive z-direction are:

\[\epsilon^{\mu}(\pm)=(1/\sqrt{2})(0,1,\pm i,0)\]

and

\[\epsilon^{\mu}(L)=(1/m_{W})(k^{0},0,0,|k|)\]

where \(k^{\mu}=(k^{0},0,0,|k|)\) is the quadri-momentum of the W.

**2.4 The Goldstone-boson equivalence theorem**

The special role of longitudinal modes is decribed in the Goldstone-boson equivalence theorem [4], proved to all orders in perturbation theory [5,6]. This theorem [4] states that, at high energy i.e. in an energy regime where \(E_{W}>>m_{W}\), the scattering amplitude of any process involving external longitudinal \(W\)'s, may be calculated up to the order \(O(m_{W}/E_{W})\) if the longitudinal bosons are replaced by the corresponding Goldstone bosons \((w)\). These bosons \(w\) have generated the longitudinal component (and thus the mass) of the gauge bosons. The scattering amplitude, then, reads:

\[{\cal M}(W_{L}(p_{1}),W_{L}(p_{2}),...)={\cal M}(w(p_{1}),w(p_{2}),...)+O( \frac{m_{W}}{E_{W}})\]

Such an approach considerably simplifies the calculation. The amplitude

\[{\cal M}(w(p_{1}),w(p_{2}),...)_{R}\]

is calculated in a gauge \(R\). The total amplitude for the \(w^{+}w^{+}\) scattering is given by:

\[-i{\cal M}_{tot}=-\frac{g^{2}m_{H}^{\,2}}{4m_{W}^{\,2}}(\frac{t}{t-m_{H}^{\,2 }}+\frac{u}{u-m_{H}^{\,2}})\]

with \(s\), \(|t|\), \(|u|\), \(m_{H}^{\,2}>>m_{W}^{\,2}\).

**2.5 The alternate models**

The scattering amplitude \(M\) may be decomposed into a summation over partial waves:

\[-i{\cal M}=32\pi\sum_{0}^{\infty}(2\ell+1)P_{\ell}(cos\theta)a_{\ell}\]

with

\[a_{\ell}=\frac{1}{64\pi}\int_{-1}^{+1}d(cos\theta)P_{\ell}(cos\theta)(-i{ \cal M})\]where \(\ell\) is the orbital momentum. Unitarity puts the following constraint on \(a_{\ell}\):

\[|a_{\ell}-\frac{1}{2}i|\leq\frac{1}{2} \tag{3}\]

The computation of \(a_{0}\) gives \(a_{0}=-g^{2}s/128\pi m_{W}^{\ 2}\approx-s/32\pi v^{2}\), where \(v\) is the Higgs field vacuum expectation value. This latter relation does not respect unitarity at high energy. It has been demonstrated [7] that the Higgs mass cannot exceed 1 TeV (\(m_{H}<1TeV\)) in order to satisfy Eq. 3 for \(\ell=0\) (the \(\ell=0\) partial wave is the dominant contribution for the energies of interest). Consequently, the respect of unitarity is enforced by the Feynman diagram (a) in fig. 1 which involves a not too heavy Higgs particle. In absence of a Higgs particle (dynamical symmetry breaking models) the unitarisation has to be implemented by other means. Barger et al. [2], have considered alternative models: (i) the rescaled \(\pi^{+}\pi^{+}\) scattering, (ii) the low energy theorem (LET), (iii) the sharp-cutoff unitarization, and (iv) the \(O(2N)\) Higgs-Goldstone model.

(i) The rescaled \(\pi^{+}\pi^{+}\) scattering model

The breaking of \(SU(2)_{L}\times SU(2)_{R}\) chiral symmetry yields Goldstone bosons, approximately represented by pions. The rescaled \(\pi^{+}\pi^{+}\) scattering model is exploiting \(\pi^{+}\pi^{+}\) scattering data [8]. It assumes that the \(SU(2)_{L}\times U(1)_{Y}\) symmetry breaking is exactly the same as the one for the QCD strong interaction at a larger energy scale [9]. The energy available for \(\pi^{+}\pi^{+}\) scattering is smaller than 1 GeV. Therefore, a multiplicative rescaling factor (\(v/F_{\pi}\approx\)2600, \(F_{\pi}\) is the pion decay constant) has to be applied to that amplitude in order to obtain the \(w^{+}w^{+}\) scattering amplitude (equivalence theorem).

(ii) Low energy theorem

The amplitude describing the scattering of Goldstone bosons (\(w^{+}w^{+}\to w^{+}w^{+}\)) can be approximated by [5, 9]:

\[-i\,{\cal M}\approx-\frac{s}{v^{\ 2}}\]

This approximation holds within the limit: \(s<<m_{H}^{\ 2}\), which correspond to a very heavy Higgs (\(m_{H}\to\infty\)). The \(a_{0}\) partial wave clearly violates the unitarity limit at high energy. Unitarity is restored via the elastic scattering corresponding to the transformation \(a_{0}\to a_{0}/(1-ia_{0})\). After application of this transformation the amplitude reads:

\[-i\,{\cal M}=-\frac{s}{v^{\ 2}}(1+\frac{is}{32\pi v^{\ 2}})^{-1}\]

(iii) The sharp-cutoff unitarization

At low energies, compared with the value of the Higgs mass, it has been suggested [5, 9] to apply a sharp cut on \(a_{0}=-s/32\pi v^{\ 2}\) when it reaches the value -1, with the result:

\[-i\,{\cal M}=-\frac{s}{v^{\ 2}},\quad s<32\pi v^{\ 2}\]

and

\[-i\,{\cal M}=-32\pi,\quad s>32\pi v^{\ 2}\]

(iv) \(O(2N)\) Higgs-Goldstone model 

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:6]

\(\overline{b}W^{-}\to q_{i}\overline{q_{j}}\overline{b}\,\)lead to a \(W^{+}W^{+}\) pair in the final state. The Feynman diagrams, to the order \(\alpha\alpha_{s}^{2}\) are shown in fig. 5. A top mass of 135 GeV has been taken, consistent with LEP and CDF limits [13]. The calculation of the cross section is given by Kunszt [14].

- Other possible sources of background

Other sources of background for \(W_{L}^{+}W_{L}^{+}\) signal exist such as : \(pp\to W^{+}X\) pile-up events, 4 parton scattering, \(W^{+}Z^{0}\) and \(Z^{0}Z^{0}\) pair production. These backgrounds appear at a level of \(10^{-5}\)[15] and therefore are neglected in the present study. The process \(t\overline{t}\to l^{+}l^{+}+X\) is another possible source of background. Like-sign lepton pairs are produced, in that processes, via the sequence: \(t\to W^{-}\overline{b}\), \(\overline{b}\to W^{+}\overline{c}\), \(W^{+}\to l^{+}\nu\) and \(\overline{t}\to W^{+}b\), \(W^{+}\to l^{+}\nu\). Such a process has large cross section. Due to pile-up of minimum biased events, it is not possible to introduce cuts on the number of jets. However, it is likely that the number of very high energy jets could serve as a cut. The analysis of this background process is in progress and will be reported in a future note.

The study of the \(W^{+}W^{-}\) background (produced by \(q-\overline{q}\) or \(g-g\) fusion), with a misidentified \(W^{-}\) charge, is also under study and will be reported later. The \(W^{+}W^{-}\) cross section is about 500 fb (including the branching ratios of \(W\) to \(e\) and \(\mu\)) before any cuts. It has been argued in the ATLAS LoI [16] that the central tracker should enable the lepton charge identification up to \(p_{T}\approx 500GeV\). Fig. 10 of the present note, shows that leptons are very few for \(p_{T}>500GeV\). Nevertheless, this source of background will be studied further in a future note.

## 4 Monte Carlo simulations

The simulation of \(pp\to W^{+}W^{+}X\to l^{+}\nu l^{+}\nu X\) events was performed by Monte Carlo techniques. The PYTHIA 5.6 Monte Carlo generator [17] was used for the \(W_{L}^{+}W_{L}^{+}\) signal, whereas other simulation code [2, 18] was used for background studies. Two cases were studied: \(m_{H}=0.5\) and \(1.0\) TeV. The proton structure functions of EHLQ set 1 [19] evaluated at \(Q^{2}=m_{W}^{2}\) scale, were used. A reason for this choice is that \(Q^{2}\), characterizing the \(W\) emission by a quark, is of the order of \(m_{W}^{2}\)[3]. It is worth noticing that other choices for the proton structure function give significantly different values in cross section [2]. The choice \(Q^{2}=\hat{s}\) in [2] leads to a cross section reaching up to 50% of the value obtained for \(Q^{2}=m_{W}^{2}\). The observables chosen for the present study are related to the detected leptons and jets.

The informations searched for the leptons are: (i) the primordial charge, (ii) the energy, and (iii) the momentum vector \((p_{x},p_{y},p_{z})\). Jets produced in \(pp\to W^{+}W^{+}X\) are yielded by the weak decays: \(q_{i}\to Wq_{j}\) where the \(q_{j}\) quark gets hadronized or fragmented to form a jet. The remnant jets, from the spectator quarks of the proton, mainly propagate along the beam pipe and are included in PYTHIA. The aperture is defined in terms of azimuthal angle \((\phi)\) and pseudorapidity \((\eta)\) according to

\[\Delta R=\sqrt{\Delta\phi^{2}+\Delta\eta^{2}}\]

The informations sought from jets are: (i) their transverse momentum, (ii) energy deposition in calorimeters, and their pseudorapidity.

The lepton and jet observables chosen to separate the \(W_{L}^{+}W_{L}^{+}\) signal from backgrounds are:* the invariant mass \(m_{ll}\) of the two leptons (\(E_{i}\),\(P_{i}\)) \[m_{ll}^{2}=m_{l1}^{2}+m_{l2}^{2}+2(E_{l1}E_{l2}-P_{l1}P_{l2})\]
* the minimum transverse momentum \(p_{T}^{min}\) (\(\min(p_{T_{l1}}\),\(p_{T_{l2}}\)))
* the maximum rapidity \(|y_{l}|^{max}\) (\(\max(y_{l1}\),\(y_{l2}\)))
* cosine of the angle \(z_{ll}\) between the two leptons in the transverse plane \[z_{ll}=\frac{P_{T_{l1}}.P_{T_{l2}}}{|P_{T_{l1}}||P_{T_{l2}}|}\]
* the difference \(\delta p_{T}^{ll}=|P_{T_{l1}}-P_{T_{l2}}|\) of the two lepton momenta in the transverse plane
* the missing transverse energy defined by \(E_{T}^{miss}=-|\sum_{i}P_{T_{i}}|\)
* for the jets produced, the largest \(p_{T}\) of all observed jets (\(p_{T}(j)^{hard}\)) and the associated pseudorapidity \(|\eta|\) (\(\eta(j)^{hard}\)), are considered: \[p_{T}(j)^{hard}=max(p_{T}(j_{1}),p_{T}(j_{2}),...,p_{T}(j_{n}))\] \[\eta(j)^{hard}\neq max(|\eta(j_{1})|,|\eta(j_{2})|,...,|\eta(j_{n})|)\]

The initial expectation, that the backgrounds are larger than the signal itself, has dictated a particular strategy. More events were generated for the backgrounds than for the \(W_{L}^{+}W_{L}^{+}\) signal. Thus, \(10^{5}\)\(W_{L}^{+}W_{L}^{+}\) and \(W_{L}^{-}W_{L}^{-}\) events were generated for \(m_{H}\)= 1.0 TeV. The same number of events was also generated for \(m_{H}\)= 0.5 TeV. A total of \(\approx 8.2\times 10^{5}\) events were generated to simulate the various background processes (\(W_{T}^{+}W_{T}^{+}\), gluon exchange, and \(W^{+}t\bar{t}\)). The generation of background events four times larger in number than the signal events, had the consequence that the statistical errors were negligible.

The performance of the ATLAS detector has been included after generation of the events at the interaction point. The physics characteristics and acceptance of the ATLAS detector are displayed in Table 1.

In order to account for the resolution effects (smearing), the uncertainty of the particle momentum and energy were calculated by choosing, randomly, two numbers, \(R_{1}\) and \(R_{2}\), following a Gaussian distribution with a mean zero and variance \(\sigma=1\). The uncertainty (\(dp\)) on the momentum were then calculated according to:

\[\frac{dp}{p}=R_{1}\times(\frac{0.1}{\sqrt{E}})+R_{2}\times 0.01\]

(E in GeV) for electrons and photons, with a \(\eta\) coverage of \(-3<\eta<3\). This takes into account the electromagnetic calorimeter resolution (Table 1).

For muons[15]:

\[\frac{dp}{p}=\frac{R_{1}\times F(p_{T},\eta)}{100}\]where the \(\mathit{dp_{T}}/\mathit{p_{T}}=F(\mathit{p_{T}},\eta)\) is shown in fig. 6, for various \(\mathit{p_{T}}\)[15].

and

\[\frac{\mathit{dp}}{\mathit{p}}=R_{1}\times(\frac{0.5}{\sqrt{E}})+R_{2}\times 0.03\]

for hadrons (takes into account the barrel and end-cap hadron calorimeter resolution) in the region of \(-3<\eta<3\). For the forward region, \(3<|\eta|<5\),

\[\frac{\mathit{dp}}{\mathit{p}}=R_{1}\times(\frac{1.0}{\sqrt{E}})+R_{2}\times 0.07\]

\((\mathrm{E\,in\,\,GeV})\).

An equal uncertainty was assumed for the \(\mathit{p_{x}}\), \(\mathit{p_{y}}\), and \(\mathit{p_{z}}\) taken separately. These are recalculated following:

\[\mathit{p_{i}}\to\mathit{p_{i}}\times(1.0+\frac{\mathit{dp}}{\mathit{p}})\]

The observables listed above were computed for the new \(\mathit{p_{i}}\) values. Leptons produced by the \(W^{+}_{L}W^{+}_{L}\) signal are isolated from jets. Only a small amount of energy around the detected lepton is accepted. Fig. 7 shows the distribution for \(\mathit{pp}\to W^{+}W^{+}X\to l^{+}\nu l^{+}\nu X\) for \(\mathit{m_{H}}\)= 1.0 TeV of the transverse energy, \(\mathit{E_{T}}\), contained in a cone with a \(\Delta R<0.2\) aperture around the leptons. In order to select like-charge lepton pairs (\(l^{+}l^{+}\) or \(l^{-}l^{-}\)), the lepton with the highest energy (independently of the charge) has been selected among all the detected leptons; then, a second lepton has been searched, the most energetic among the remaining leptons, with the same charge as the first lepton. The \(W^{+}_{L}W^{+}_{L}\) signal is characterized by the associated production of two jets at large rapidity, whereas more than two jets might appear in the production of W pairs from \(W^{+}t\bar{t}\). The jets have been reconstructed applying the Durham algorithm [20, 21]. This recent jet-clustering algorithm, commonly used in \(e^{+}e^{-}\) collisions, is based on an iterative process of recombination of clusters, selecting, at each step of the iteration, the pair having the minimum relative momentum. The application of this method of jet combination to hadronic collisions has been recently considered in [22].

## 5 Analysis and results

The total cross sections, backgrounds and signal to background ratios for \(\mathit{pp}\to W^{+}W^{+}X\to l^{+}\nu l^{+}\nu X\) production, at \(\sqrt{s}\)= 16 TeV, are reported in Table 2 for \(\mathit{m_{H}}\) = 0.5 and 1.0 TeV.

These values include the branching ratio \((\mathit{Br}(W^{+}\to l^{+}\nu))^{2}\approx 5\%\)[23], the acceptance and physics limitations of the ATLAS detector. The efficiency for finding leptons is assumed to be 100%. The efficiency loss results from events lost or undetected caused by detector imperfections: an hermicity smaller than 4\(\pi\) sterad, finite resolution for electromagnetic and hadronic calorimeters, and some physics limitations such as a partial pseudorapidity coverage of the lepton detector. Consequently, considering the number of generated \(W^{+}_{L}W^{+}_{L}\) events, about 7% (8%) were lost when \(\mathit{m_{H}}\)= 1.0 TeV (0.5 TeV). Concerning the various backgrounds, the following losses of events were observed: 10% for the production of \(W^{+}_{T}W^{+}_{T}\) events, 12% for \(W^{+}\) pair production from gluon exchange and about 8% for the \(W^{+}t\bar{t}\) process. This difference showing up in the event losses between the signal and the background can be understood from fig. 8, which shows \(d\sigma/d|y_{l}|^{max}\) as a function of \(|y_{l}|^{max}\) (\(m\,ax(y_{l1},y_{l2})\)) for \(pp\to W^{+}W^{+}X\to l^{+}\nu l^{+}\nu X\). The leptons, produced by the background processes, are more distributed around the \(|\eta|\geq 3\) pseudorapidity region, which appears not to be the case for the \(W^{+}_{L}W^{+}_{L}\) signal. Considering that two like-charge leptons are required, if one of the two leptons falls outside the pseudorapidity region not covered by the electromagnetic calorimeter (for electrons) or the muon detector (for muons), the event is lost.

From Table 2, it can be observed that the total cross section for the \(W^{+}_{L}W^{+}_{L}\) signal production is relatively small, 0.95 and 0.63 fb for \(m_{H}=1.0\) TeV and 0.5 TeV, respectively. The cross sections corresponding to the background processes are larger: 10 fb for \(W^{+}\) pairs production via gluon exchange, 13 fb for \(W^{+}_{T}W^{+}_{T}\) production, and 19 fb for \(W^{+}t\bar{t}\) processes. The signal to background ratio is, therefore, very small: 2.2% and 1.5% for \(m_{H}=1.0\) TeV and 0.5 TeV, respectively. For an annual LHC integrated luminosity of \(\int L\sim 100fb^{-1}\), less than 100 \(pp\to W^{+}W^{+}X\to l^{+}\nu l^{+}\nu X\) events yieldded by the \(W^{+}_{L}W^{+}_{L}\) signal, are expected per year (\(\sim 95\) (63) for \(m_{H}\)= 1.0 (0.5) TeV) comparatively to \(\sim 4,279\) backgrounds events, leading to a ratio signal/\(\sqrt{background}\approx 1.45\) (\(m_{H}\)= 1.0 TeV) and \(\sim 0.96\) (\(m_{H}\)= 0.5 TeV).

Therefore, a set of cuts were applied in order to enhance the \(W^{+}_{L}W^{+}_{L}\) signal over background. Figs 8 to 15 show, for \(m_{H}\)= 1.0 TeV, the \(pp\to W^{+}W^{+}X\to l^{+}\nu l^{+}\nu X\) differential cross sections for \(|y_{l}|\), \(m_{ll}\), \(p_{T}^{min}(l)\), \(z_{l}\), \(\delta p_{T}^{ll}\), \(E_{T}^{miss}\), \(|\eta(j)|^{hard}\), and \(p_{T}(j)^{hard}\), respectively. The comparison is made between the \(W^{+}_{L}W^{+}_{L}\) signal and the various backgrounds. The event distribution as a function of \(|y_{l}|^{max}\) (fig. 8) shows that the \(W^{+}_{L}W^{+}_{L}\) signal is less pronounced for \(|y|^{max}\geq 2\). Fig. 11 shows that the \(W^{+}_{L}W^{+}_{L}\) signal has larger contribution in the \(z_{l}\)= - 1 region, indicating that leptons are produced back-to-back in most of the events, whereas this is less the case for background events.

### Cuts on jets and leptons

The results shown in fig. 14 indicate that the bulk of the contribution of jets from the \(W^{+}_{L}W^{+}_{L}\) signal is mostly forward or backward i.e. for \(|\eta(j)|^{hard}\geq 2\). This tendency is not observed for the background events which are mostly contributing in the \(|\eta(j)|^{hard}\leq 3\) region. At the same time, the background events are mostly distributed over the region of \(p_{T}(j)^{hard}>50\) GeV (fig. 15). These results lead to consider the \(p_{T}(j)^{hard}\) and \(|\eta(j)|^{hard}\) observables, simultaneously. These distributions, for signal and backgrounds events, are shown in fig. 16. The signal events are concentrated in the regions \(2.5<|\eta(j)|^{hard}<5\) and \(0<p_{T}(j)^{hard}<100\) GeV. The \(W^{+}\) pair events, from gluon exchange, are mostly found in the region \(|\eta(j)|^{hard}<2\) and uniformly distributed over the \(p_{T}(j)^{hard}\) range. The \(W^{+}t\bar{t}\) events are mostly distributed over the regions \(|\eta(j)|^{hard}<2\) and \(40<p_{T}(j)^{hard}<110\) GeV. The \(W^{+}_{T}W^{+}_{T}\) events are uniformly distributed over the \(|\eta(j)|^{hard}\) and \(p_{T}(j)^{hard}\) ranges. These observations suggest to only retain events falling in a trapezoid region delimited by 4 straight lines (\(d_{1}\), \(d_{2}\), \(d_{3}\), \(d_{4}\)) defined by the equations below (\(p_{T}(j)^{hard}\) in abcissa, \(|\eta(j)|^{hard}\) in ordinate):

\(d_{1}\): \(|\eta(j)|^{hard}=\eta_{0}\)

\(d_{2}\): \(|\eta(j)|^{hard}=\eta_{1}\)

\(d_{3}\): passing through the points (\(p_{T_{1}}\), \(\eta_{1}\)) and (\(p_{T_{2}}\), \(\eta_{0}\)), with \(p_{T_{2}}>p_{T_{1}}\)\(d_{4}\): passing through the points \((p_{T_{3}},\,\eta_{1})\) and \((p_{T_{4}},\,\eta_{0})\), with \(p_{T_{4}}>p_{T_{3}}\)

The final value of the parameters corresponding to a reduction of the background by a factor \(\sim 20\) are listed in Table 3.

About 60% of the \(W_{L}^{+}W_{L}^{+}\) signal events were lost but the ratio signal to background improved to \(1/5\) (\(m_{H}=1.0\) TeV) and \(1/15\) (\(m_{H}=0.5\) TeV). Further enhancement of this ratio may be obtained by applying cuts on leptons distributions, in addition to those applied on jets. The cuts on leptons help to reduce considerably the various backgrounds with, obviously additional loss on the \(W_{L}^{+}W_{L}^{+}\) signal events. The cuts applied on the leptonic observables are listed in Table 4.

No cut was applied on \(E_{T}^{miss}\) since the cuts applied on the other observables were already sufficient.

### Results

The total cross sections, backgrounds and signal to background ratios for \(pp\to W^{+}W^{+}X\to l^{+}\nu l^{+}\nu X\) production, at \(\sqrt{s}\)= 16 TeV, are reported in Table 5 for \(m_{H}=0.5\) and 1.0 TeV after application of cuts on jets and leptons (Table 3 and 4).

A ratio signal to background of 3/1 for \(m_{H}=1.0\) TeV and 1.5/1 for \(m_{H}=0.5\) TeV, is obtained. This constitutes a large improvement over the ratio value before cuts (1/45 and 1/68 for \(m_{H}=1.0\) TeV \(m_{H}=0.5\) TeV, respectively). Signal events have been lost after cuts. However, with these cuts and for an annual integrated luminosity of 100 \(fb^{-1}\), the observation of 18 \(W^{+}W^{+}\) (signal and background) events per year is expected for \(m_{H}=1.0\) TeV, this number being reduced to 11 for \(m_{H}=0.5\) TeV. Thus, the signal can be observed with a statistical significance (\(signal/\sqrt{background}\)) of \(13.6/\sqrt{4.5}=6.4\) for \(m_{H}=1.0\) TeV and of \(6.5/\sqrt{4.5}=3.1\) for \(m_{H}=0.5\) TeV. These statistical significance values, calculated assuming a Gaussian distribution of events, are on the optimistic side, considering the small number of signal events. The background provided by \(W_{T}^{+}W_{T}\) production is more difficult to eliminate. These events survive with a cross section of 0.033 \(fb\), corresponding to less than 4 events per year. The background yielded by \(W^{+}\) pair production, via gluon exchange, has been totally reduced, with a cross section of 0.002 \(fb\), less than 1 event per year. The remaining background from \(W^{+}t\bar{t}\) events correspond to a cross section of 0.01 \(fb\) with less than 2 events per year. Globally, the background cross section was reduced from 42.79 \(fb\) to 0.045 \(fb\), i.e. a factor 10\({}^{3}\).

These results bring a constraint on the Higgs mass, according to the number of events which will be really observed in ATLAS. Indeed, if \(m_{H}<0.5\) TeV, the measured \(pp\to W^{+}W^{+}X\to l^{+}\nu l^{+}\nu X\) cross section should be less than \(\sim 0.12\)\(fb\). For \(0.5<m_{H}<1.0\) TeV, the measured cross section should be between \(\sim 0.12\)\(fb\) and \(\sim 0.20\)\(fb\).

The number of signal events found in the present study is of the same order of magnitude as that obtained in [2]. It should stressed, however, that in [2] no detector effect was accounted for, simpler cuts (specially on \(|\eta(j)|\) and \(p_{T}(j)\)) were applied and, finally, a different (unfavoured) \(Q^{2}\) dependence for the proton structure function was used.

The \(pp\to W^{+}W^{+}X\to l^{+}\nu l^{+}\nu X\) cross section has been calculated in the framework of alternate models considering a dynamical process of symmetry breaking (without Higgs particle) [2]. Although, a strict comparison cannot be performed with the present results, since the events produced in these models have not been generated, a rough estimate may be attempted. Estimates of the \(pp\to W^{+}W^{+}X\to l^{+}\nu l^{+}\nu X\) cross section in these alternate models, naively assuming the cut effects, detector efficiencies and resolutions, used in the present SM study, are reported in Table 6. The sensitivity of the observed number of \(W^{+}W^{+}\) events on the unitarization models is clearly apparent.

## 6 Conclusion

The \(pp\to W^{+}W^{+}X\to l^{+}\nu l^{+}\nu X\) reaction was simulated at \(\sqrt{s}=16\) TeV. The ATLAS detector performances were taken into account: non-hermeticity of the detector and resolution effects. The results are shown in Table 5. They were obtained by applying cuts on selected observable distributions considering the production cross section of the \(W^{+}_{L}W^{+}_{L}\) signal and the various background processes. The main conclusion is that the \(W^{+}_{L}W^{+}_{L}\) signal can be separated from backgrounds. In spite of a signal loss, and a non-zero remaining background, a ratio signal to background of \(3/1\) and \(1.5/1\) is obtained for Higgs masses of \(1.0\) TeV and \(0.5\) TeV, respectively. Many years of running at high luminosity will be needed to ascertain the presence of a signal and its possible origin. The present analysis was carried out at \(\sqrt{s}=16\) TeV. It should be stressed, however, that, prior to any cuts, the cross section for the reaction \(pp\to W^{+}W^{+}X\) is about 25% smaller at \(\sqrt{s}=14\) TeV, both for \(m_{H}=1.0\) and for \(m_{H}=0.5\) TeV. The various backgrounds studied in the present note, are also suppressed at \(\sqrt{s}=14\) TeV: by \(\sim 20\)% for the \(W^{+}_{T}W^{+}_{T}\) background, and by \(\sim 15\)% for the \(W^{+}W^{+}\) (gluon exchange) and \(W^{+}t\bar{t}\) backgrounds. These results, at \(\sqrt{s}=14\) TeV, are preliminary and serve only as an indication. A complete analysis, at \(\sqrt{s}=14\) TeV, will be presented in a future note.
