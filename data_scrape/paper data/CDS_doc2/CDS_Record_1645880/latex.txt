Introduction

The LHC will be upgraded in several phases with the goal of obtaining an instantaneous luminosity of \(5-7\times 10^{34}\) cm\({}^{-2}\)s\({}^{-1}\) at a center of mass energy of 14 TeV and integrated luminosity of 3000 fb\({}^{-1}\). The ATLAS detector will also be upgraded in stages to cope with higher collision rates and radiation background. The ATLAS muon Small Wheel detectors cover the pseudo-rapidity range of \(1.3<|\eta|<2.7\) and provide forward muon precision tracking. Level-1 (L1) muon triggering is based on track segments in the TGC chambers of the Big Wheels detector. To reduce the problem with high muon trigger rates and degraded muon tracking at high luminosity, ATLAS proposes to replace the present Small Wheel detectors with the \(New\)\(Small\)\(Wheels\) (nSW). The nSW will employ Micromegas detectors (MM) for precision tracking and small-strip, Thin Gap Multi-Wire Chambers (sTGC) for primary L1 triggering. The proposed nSW will be composed of two four-layer MM detector sandwiched between two four-layer sTGC quadruplets.

A schematic view of the sTGC structure is shown in Fig. 1. It is similar to the present TGC in ATLAS [1]. The distance between neighboring wires is 1.8 mm and the distance between the wire and the cathode plane is 1.4 mm. There are a few changes compared with ATLAS TGCs:

* Lower cathode surface resistivity: to reduce charge accumulations on the cathode when chamber operates at high rate, cathode surface resistivity is changed from \(\mathrm{M\Omega}/\raisebox{-1.72pt}{\hbox to 0.0pt{$\square$}}\) to a few tens of \(\mathrm{k\Omega}/\raisebox{-1.72pt}{\hbox to 0.0pt{$\square$}}\);
* Smaller cathode-readout plane distance: the distance is reduced to 0.1 mm to increase the capacitive coupling between the cathode and readout plane;
* Smaller strip pitch: the pitch is reduced to 3.2 mm to improve the measurement of charge centroid position by charge interpolation;
* Pad segmentation on one side of the cathodes: pads are used for fast pattern recognition of tracks to select strips for read out.

The sTGC detectors are required to identify each bunch crossing and to measure the muon trajectories with an angular resolution of less than 1 mrad for \(1.3<|\eta|<2.7\) at L1. The present TGC detector has wires along the \(\phi\) direction, the proposed sTGC detector will have fine-pitch strips along in \(\phi\) and wires

approximately aligned along the azimuthal direction, as illustrated in Fig. 2. An additional requirement is the ability to operate in a high neutron and photon radiation environment with hit rates up to a few tens of kHz/cm\({}^{2}\) in the innermost region of the nSW. The sTGCs will be operated at lower voltages than TGCs to minimize aging effects. Moreover, the chambers are exposed to stray magnetic fields from the nearby end-cap and barrel toroids and hence must tolerate modest magnetic fields without a loss in performance.

We have carried out various simulation studies of the characteristics and performance of the sTGC detector. This note is organized as follows. Sec. 2 presents the simulation of the electric field inside the chamber that determines the electron drift behavior and the detector timing performance. Sec. 3 has studies of the ionization from charged particles in the gas gap using the HEED simulation program [2] as well as results on electron transportation properties. Sec. 4 discusses avalanche and charge production processes simulated using the Garfield [3] package together with the Magboltz program [4]. Sec. 5 has detailed studies on timing performance. Finally, Sec. 6 treats charge spread and sharing.

## 2 Electric field simulation

The simulation uses a coordinate system where \(x\) is along the strips, \(y\) is along the wires and \(z\) defines the chamber depth. The electric field inside the chamber is simulated using both the Maxwell [5] program based on a finite element method (FEM), and the neBEM package [6] using the nearly exact boundary element method. Both packages are able to perform three-dimensional simulation of electric field with arbitrary geometries.

An example of the simulated normal component of the electric field in the \(Y-Z\) plane with a high voltage of 3.0 kV is shown in Fig. 3 (left). Results from two different methods are consistent and agree well with the two-dimensional analytical calculation in Garfield. The discontinuity of the simulated electric field near the wire surface using the FEM method is clearly visible. This is mainly due to the interpolation between element boundaries and the inadequate field approximation using low-order polynomials.

with high voltages from 2.0 kV to 3.0 kV using a step size of 0.2 kV, are illustrated in Fig. 3 (right). A field strength of a few kV/cm up to a few hundred kV/cm is seen for most regions. The electric field map in the \(Y-Z\) plane for a typical operating high voltage of 2.85 kV is shown in Fig. 4 for half of the wire-to-wire region. The electric field is more than 1 kV/cm in 97% of the gas volume, with the weakest field only in a small region in the middle of the two neighboring wires.

Ionization and electron transportation

### Electron-gas molecular interaction and ionization

The operational gas for sTGC is a mixture of CO\({}_{2}\) and n-pentane (C\({}_{5}\)H\({}_{12}\)) with a ratio of 55:45 at one atmospheric pressure. The electron thermal energy distribution at different electric fields and electron interaction cross-sections in this gas mixture are shown in Fig. 5(a) and 5(b), respectively. With a typical field strength of a few kV/cm throughout most of the chamber volume, the average electron energy is less than 1 eV. The dominant process is elastic scattering and the contributions from the attachment process are negligible. The mean electron energy increases to several eV when the electron is within few tens of microns of wire surface where very high electric field is present. The attachment process occurring in that region will primarily affect the overall avalanche size rather than the timing performance of the detector, which is mainly determined by the uncertainty on the arrival time of the earliest arrival cluster.

Ionizations occur when a charged particle passes through the gas gap and transfers energy to gas molecules. In most cases the knocked-out electrons have very short ranges and form a "cluster" near the interaction point. Energetic delta electrons with ranges of a few millimeters or more can be produced by large energy transfers. The number of clusters produced (\(n\)) follows a Poisson distribution:

\[P(n,\mu)=\frac{n^{\mu}}{n!}\exp(-\mu) \tag{1}\]

where \(\mu\) is the mean number of ionization collisions in the gas gap. An example using 180 GeV muons in a sTGC chamber with 2.8 mm gas gap and a mixture of CO\({}_{2}\) and n-pentane (55:45) has been simulated with the HEED program. Distributions such as electron-ion pairs per cluster, number of ionization clusters and the total number of electrons produced are shown in Fig. 6(a), 6(b) and 6(c), respectively. On average, 22.8 clusters are produced with 2.06 electron-ion pairs per cluster. Energy depositions in the gas gap for muons as well as electrons and several types of charged hadrons are shown in Fig. 6(d). For high energy (\(>\)1 GeV) charged particles, roughly 1 keV energy is deposited in the gas gap. It should be noted that slow-moving protons with few MeV kinetic energy, which usually created as secondaries after calorimeter, can produce ten times or more ionization clusters as for minimum ionizing particles(MIPs).

### Electron transportation

Ionized electrons drifting along the electric field towards the electrodes will have frequent collisions with gas atoms and molecules and diffuse laterally and longitudinally with respective to the electric field direction. In addition, their motions will also be affected if there is an external magnetic field. The electron drift velocity in this case is determined by:

\[m\frac{d\vec{v}}{dt}=e(\vec{E}+\vec{v}\times\vec{B})-m\frac{\vec{v}}{\tau} \tag{2}\]

where \(\vec{E}\), \(\vec{B}\), \(\vec{v}\) are the electric field, magnetic field and electron velocity, respectively, and \(\tau\) is the mean time between collisions, which depends on the electron energy, collision cross-sections as well as gas density. The first two terms on the right side of the equation are the Lorentz force and the last term models the friction force between the electron and gas molecules. The simulated electron drift velocities

Figure 6: Ionization statistics of 180 GeV muons (a,b,c) and energy deposition from electrons, muons and several types of charged hadrons inside an sTGC chamber with a 2.8 mm gas gap and a gas mixture of CO\({}_{2}\):n-pentane (55:45)in several CO\({}_{2}\) and n-pentane mixtures at 1 atm pressure are shown in Fig. 7. The n-pentane is liquid at room temperature and the gas blends are obtained by bubbling CO\({}_{2}\) through the liquid and mixing with n-pentane saturated vapor. The temperatures shown in the plot indicate the temperature needed for obtaining various mixtures under one atmospheric pressure. Additionally, the simulated drift velocity as a function of the electric field in a CO\({}_{2}\):n-pentane (55:45) gas mixture is compared with the measured data as reported in [7]. Good agreement is found up to 10 kV/cm.

In the presence of a magnetic field orthogonal to the electric field direction, electrons will drift in directions both parallel and perpendicular to the electric field. The drift velocity is modified due to changes in mean collision time. The deflection angle between the electric field and the electron drift direction is called the Lorentz angle and is given by:

\[\theta_{L}=\tan^{-1}(\frac{eB}{m}\tau). \tag{3}\]

where \(e\), \(m\) are electron charge and mass, respectively. The Lorentz angle is an important parameter that determines the displacement of clusters from inclined charged tracks. Moreover, this angle is related to the elongation of the electron drift path and could have potential influence on the timing performance of the sTGC detectors.

The electron drift velocity and the Lorentz angle in CO\({}_{2}\) and n-pentane (55:45) with a magnetic field orthogonal to the electric field is simulated using Magboltz and results are shown in Fig. 8 (a) and (b), respectively. The modification of the drift velocity with a magnetic field up to 1 T is found to be negligible. The Lorentz angles are relatively small and less than 7 \({}^{\circ}\) for \(B\leq 1\) T. The predicted results are similar to those reported in [8; 9; 10] and show that gas mixtures with a significant amount of CO\({}_{2}\) generally have small Lorentz angles.

Figure 7: The electron drift velocity as a function of the electric field in several CO\({}_{2}\):n-pentane mixtures.

The electron diffusion, the electron mean track deviation in any direction due to scattering with gas molecules, over a distance \(S\) is given by:

\[\sigma_{L,T}=D_{L,T}\sqrt{S} \tag{4}\]

where \(D_{L}\) and \(D_{T}\) are longitudinal and transverse diffusion coefficients respectively. The transverse diffusion in the direction traverse to the electric field vector determines the lateral spread while the longitudinal diffusion along the electric field direction influences the time jitter of drift electrons. Both coefficients as functions of the electric field and orthogonal magnetic field have been simulated and are shown in Fig. 9. The longitudinal and transverse diffusion of electrons are expected to be less than 40 \(\mu\)m over a drift length of 1.4 mm in sTGCs.

## 4 Charge production

### The electron avalanche and its fluctuations

The electron avalanche process in sTGCs is simulated using Garfield with a microscopic method, which traces electron interactions at the molecular level. An avalanche initiated by a single electron at 2.4 kV is illustrated in Fig.10. The avalanches are usually developed within a few tens of microns of wire surface where strong electric field is present. The avalanche process is a stochastic process and the fluctuations in such strong and non-uniform fields is quantitatively modeled by Legler [11, 12] who introduced a characteristic ionization distance parameter \(\chi\):

\[\chi=\frac{\alpha(E)U_{i}}{E}=\alpha x_{0}, \tag{5}\]

where \(\alpha\) is the first Townsend coefficient that depends on the electric field, \(U_{i}\) and \(E\) are ionization potentials in the gas and the electric field, respectively, and \(x_{0}\) (\(=U_{i}/E\)) is the distance required to accelerate an electron to the ionization potential of the gas.

It should be noted that in the weak electric field where the electron mean free path is sufficiently longer than the distance required for ionization (\(\chi\ll\)1), all electrons involved have the same ionization probability and the resultant fluctuation follows an exponential distribution. However, in strong and non-uniform electric fields, \(x_{0}\) can be comparable to the mean ionization free path \(1/\alpha\) (\(\chi\to 1\)); electron that losses its energy through previous ionization collision has less probability to participate in the next ionization before enough energy is gained. Therefore, \(\alpha\) depends on the distance an electron has traveled since its last collision. When the avalanche size, the mean number of electrons produced in the avalanche, is large, the avalanche fluctuation resembles a Polya distribution [13]:

\[P(n|\bar{n},\theta)=\frac{1}{\bar{n}}\frac{\theta^{\beta}}{\Gamma(\theta)}( \frac{n}{\bar{n}})^{\theta-1}e^{-n\theta/\bar{n}} \tag{6}\]

Figure 10: Single electron avalanche profile viewed from the wire cross-section (left) and along the wire (right). Places where ionizations and excitations occur are marked with magenta and brown dots, respectively. The high voltage on the wire is 2.4 kV.

where \(\bar{n}\) is the mean number of electrons produced in the avalanche and \(\theta\) is a scale parameter related to \(\chi\). The variance of the distribution is given by:

\[\sigma^{2}=\frac{\bar{n}^{2}}{\theta}=\bar{n}^{2}f \tag{7}\]

where \(f\) is the relative width parameter describing the magnitude of the fluctuations.

As mentioned at the beginning of this section, the microscopic method is used in Garfield and relies on both ionizing and non-ionizing inelastic collision cross-sections provided by Magboltz to simulate the avalanche process. The simulated number of electrons produced by single electron avalanches at 2.5 kV and 2.7 kV in CO\({}_{2}\):n-pentane (55:45) are shown in Fig. 11(a) and 11(a) respectively. Fits of the simulated distributions with Polya functions result in a \(\theta\) (\(f\)) parameter of 1.4 (0.71) and 1.7 (0.59), respectively. It should be pointed out that CO\({}_{2}\):n-pentane is a Penning mixture in which CO\({}_{2}\) molecules excited to certain levels could transfer energy to n-pentane molecules and cause ionization. The recuperation of part of the excitation energy leaves less room for fluctuations [14] and therefore reduces the relative width [15]. The simulation here thus gives upper limits of the gas gain fluctuations.

### Induced charge component and charge collection

By importing a three-dimensional electric field into Garfield, the induced current signals can be simulated. One typical example of the induced signals on the cathode is shown in Fig. 12 for the first 30 ns after the passage of a muon. The spikes are electron induced currents from individual clusters and the long tails are due to ions. The integration of current over time gives the amount of charge collected.

Figure 11: Fluctuations of single electron avalanches at 2.5 kV (a) and 2.7 kV (b) using the microscopic method.

According to Ramo's theorem [16], the induced current on electrodes is related to the electron and ion velocities. While the electron drift velocity is very well known from experiments, less knowledge on ion mobilities in CO\({}_{2}\):n-pentane (55:45) is available. Since only the mobility of the CO\({}_{2}\)+ ions in CO\({}_{2}\) gas was reported (close to 1.1 cm\({}^{2}\cdot\)V\({}^{-1}\cdot\)s\({}^{-1}\)) under an electric field of a few kV/cm [17] and the mobility is usually smaller in larger molecular-weight gases, the ion mobility in the simulation is varied from 1.2 cm\({}^{2}\cdot\)V\({}^{-1}\cdot\)s\({}^{-1}\) to lower values. Due to the lack of an explicit model describing the dependence on the electric field, the ion mobility is assumed to be constant over the whole ion drift path in the simulation. The gas gain is fixed to \(10^{5}\) so that the total number of electrons produced in the gas gap per event is the product of the number ionized electron, which can be retrieved from the Garfield output and the fixed gain. The Garfield program can automatically compute an avalanche profile based on the integral of the first Townsend coefficient over the electron drift path. Although this leads to an actual amplification slightly different to the specified one, rough correction of the gain is applied when calculating the total number of produced electrons.

The simulated fraction of integrated charge as a function of the integration gate width starting immediately after the muon incidence is shown in Fig. 13(a) for several ion mobilities. The integrated charge is found to be proportional to the logarithm of the gate width. Results are also compared with measurements reported in [18] by normalizing the charge measured at a 100 ns gate width with the simulated charge collection ratio and scaling other measurements accordingly. Fairly good agreement is obtained with the assumption of an ion-mobility of 0.4 cm\({}^{2}\cdot\)V\({}^{-1}\cdot\)s\({}^{-1}\). This implies a very low CO\({}_{2}\)+ mobility in the n-pentane gas if it is the main positive charge carrier.

It is also possible to look at the induced charges from electrons and ions separately in the simulation as shown in Fig. 13(b). After the passage of a muon, electron-induced signals can be collected within 25 ns while ion-induced signals arrive over a few tens of \(\mu\)s. About 60% of the charge collected in the first 25 ns is found to be induced by fast moving electrons.

Figure 12: Typical induced current signal on the cathode plane.

### Gas gain

Using the dependence of the charge collection on the integration gate width, the measured charge presented in [18], with the \({}^{106}\)Rh \(\beta\)-rays irradiation of a chamber with the same geometry as an sTGC, can be converted to obtain the gas gain. The ionization produced inside the chamber by \({}^{106}\)Rh \(\beta\)-rays with a maximum energy of 3.54 MeV is simulated in Garfield and the average number of electron-ion pairs created in a 2.8 mm gas gap is found to be 31. The usage of a gate width of 300 ns results in a collection of about 42% of the total charge created in the avalanche. The simulated gas gains can be extracted from Polya function fits of the single electron avalanche distributions. A comparison of simulated gains in CO\({}_{2}\):n-pentane (55:45) with two series of available experimental data with similar n-pentane concentrations (converted from the measured charge), is shown in Fig. 14. Though no measurement was performed with CO\({}_{2}\):n-pentane (55:45), the average gas gain is expected to be between the values measured in CO\({}_{2}\):n-pentane (60:40) and in CO\({}_{2}\):n-pentane (48:52) with the same operational voltage. The simulated gain curve has a similar slope to those from experimental data, but the absolute gain values are found to be only about one quarter of the measured ones. Lower gas gain from the simulation is mainly due to that penning transfer rates are unknown and the transfer process is not implemented. It is foreseen that these discrepancies, combined with careful comparison of simulated avalanche fluctuations with experimental measurements, can be used to determine the Penning transfer rates in CO\({}_{2}\) and n-pentane mixtures in future studies.

With about 20% of the total avalanche charge collected in \(\sim\)25 ns according to results shown in Fig. 13(a) and about 2\(\times\)10\({}^{5}\) gas gain when running at 2.85 kV as shown in Fig. 14, the average charge collected by the electronics from the wires, pad, strips is expected to be about 0.3 pC, 0.15 pC, and 0.06 pC, respectively. Details of charge sharing among strips are in Sec. 6. The sTGC detector in this condition will be run in proportional mode instead of saturated avalanche mode.

Figure 13: Fraction of induced charge as a function of integration time.

## 5 Timing performance

The timing performance of sTGC is crucial for Level-1 triggering to enable the detector to identify single bunch crossings at a collision rate of 40 MHz. The jitter of the detector response time mainly arises from the variation of the drift time of electrons generated in different places along the charged particle track. The presence of complex magnetic fields in the nSW region as shown in Fig. 15 must also be accounted for (plots are generated using Persint [19]). Electron drift trajectories will change in the presence of magnetic fields.

The simulated maps of average electron drift time at different locations inside a sTGC unit cell are shown in Fig. 16(b) and Fig. 16(a) for a 1 T magnetic field orthogonal and parallel to the wires respectively. The magnetic fields are parallel to the detector cathode plane in both cases. Due to the small Lorentz angle of less than 7\({}^{\circ}\) up to 1T and no electric field along the wire direction, a magnetic field that is perpendicular to wires will increase the electron drift length by less than 10 \(\mu\)m, and thus have no effect on the electron drift time. A magnetic field parallel to wires shrinks or elongates the electron drift lines depending on the electron position with respect to the wire location. This results in a "rotation" of the electron drift map around the wire by a small angle compared with the case without a magnetic field. For both cases, the drift electrons reach the wire within 25 ns over more than 80% of the gas volume. Exceptions only take place in the center of two wires or near the cathode plane due to relatively weak electric field. The detector response time, however, has more than 80% probability to fall within the 25 ns gate starting from the track enters the chamber. This is simply the fact that a few tens of clusters will be generated across the gas gap and the timing response is only determined by the earliest arrival time of a few clusters near the wire.

Figure 14: Gas gain as a function of the high voltage.

Figure 16: Single electron drift time maps in a unit sTGC geometric cell with 1 T magnetic field parallel (a) and perpendicular (b) to the wires. Magnetic fields are parallel to the detection plane for both cases.

Figure 15: The magnetic field near the nSW.

### Earliest cluster arrival time

Due to the strong electric field inside the small gas gap and relatively low electronics threshold (\(\sim\) few fC) that can be used, amplifications of the first few clusters near the wire usually create a signal exceeding the discrimination threshold. Therefore the timing performance of the sTGC detector will be mainly determined by the earliest cluster arrival time. In other words, the fluctuations of the minimum drift time of clusters gives the physical limit of the detector time jitter.

The simulated earliest cluster arrival time distributions have been determined by tracing individual clusters and are shown in Fig.17(a) for high voltages between 3.05 kV and 2.75 kV for perpendicular track incidence. The fraction of events with earliest cluster arrival time within the given time window as a function of the window width is shown in Fig. 17(b). Lowering the high voltage by 0.2 kV from the designed TGC operational voltage of 3.0 kV, does not degrade the timing performance of the sTGC detector. More than 99% of the events have minimum cluster arrival time within the 25 ns time window.

Figure 17: Earliest cluster arrival time distributions for different high voltages (a) and the fraction of events with earliest cluster arrival time within the given time window (b).

Figure 18: Comparison of earliest cluster arrival time distributions with or without magnetic fields (a) and the fraction of events with earliest cluster arrival time within the given time window.

The earliest cluster arrival time distributions for normal track incidence, with a 1 T magnetic field either parallel or orthogonal to the wire, are simulated and compared to the distribution without a magnet field in Fig. 18. The timing distributions with and without a magnetic field are found to be very close. A slightly smaller mean value of the distribution and hence a minor improvement of the timing performance is observed for a magnetic field that is parallel to the wire. This is mainly due to the effect illustrated in Fig. 19 where the presence of this magnetic field will deflect the tracks of drifting electrons and the path of the cluster near the wire thus could be shortened. Since the magnetic fields at the nSW are typically less than 0.5 T in any direction, the impact of the magnetic field on the sTGC timing performance is negligible.

### Time spectrum

A complete simulation of the detector response time spectrum should take into account the gas gain fluctuations, electronics noise, electronics threshold as well as time jitter from external timing references. We have performed a specific simulation of the sTGC detector, which is compared with experimental measurements taken with a 180 GeV muon beam, using the following steps. The electronics threshold is set to 10 fC (6.25\(\times 10^{4}e^{-}\)), which is about 8 times larger than the \(\sim\)7500 equivalent noise charge for the front end chip used in the beam test [20]. Electrons are traced using the microscopic method and drift times of individual ionization clusters are recorded. For each cluster an amplification factor is drawn from a Polya distribution with a mean of \(10^{5}\) and a \(\theta\) parameter of 1.4 based on the results of Sec. 4. The resultant charge, calculated as the product of the number of electrons in the cluster and the sampled gas gain, is then summed when a cluster arrives on the wires. When the accumulated charge exceeds the threshold, the detector response time is assigned to be the arrival time of that cluster. For the last step, the detector response time is smeared with a Gaussian distribution that describes the timing uncertainties from external reference detectors and electronics.

The simulated time spectrum at 2.85 kV for perpendicular muon incidence is shown in Fig. 20. The result is compared with the time spectrum measured from a 9 cm \(\times\) 9 cm size sTGC pad with 0.78 ns least count TDC modules in a muon beam test performed in 2012. The time jitter for the reference scintillator is less than 2 ns while the simulation is found to have better agreement with data if a 3 ns overall time uncertainty is assumed. More than 95% of the total events can be contained within a 25 ns time window. Thresholds of 20 fC and 40 fC were also tried and did not change the time spectrum.

## 6 Strip charge sharing

Avalanches initiated by the ionized electrons and developed near wire surfaces will induce charges on the two symmetric cathode planes. The charges spread on the cathode plane, however, are constrained to be similar in size to the gas gap. Hence the charge sharing on 3.2 mm pitch readout strips underneath is insufficient to determine the charged particle hit position using a charge interpolation method. On the other hand, the localized charge on the cathode will diffuse through the resistive paint layer to the ground and image charges will be created on the readout strips, which are capacitively coupled to the resistive cathode. Therefore the resistive cathode not only provides the spark resistant functionality but also serves to disperse the charge over several readout strips to enhance tracking resolution.

A simple model has been developed to describe the charge sharing between sTGC strips. The model considers the spatial distribution and time development of raw induced charges on the cathode, and the propagation of induced signals through the resistive-capacitive network formed between the resistive cathode and the readout plane.

Information about the raw induced charge on the cathode can be obtained from Garfield simulations without taking resistive layer into account. The charge dispersion phenomenon in resistive electrodes has been studied from streamer tubes in 1980's [21, 22] to micro pattern gaseous detectors [23, 24] recently. The method developed is also applicable for sTGC.

### Raw charge spread on cathode

For multi-wire chambers, the induced charge density on a contiguous cathode plane due to a point charge deposited on the wire is described by the empirical function of Gatti _et al_. [25, 26]:

\[\Gamma(\lambda)=K_{1}\frac{1-\tanh^{2}K_{2}\lambda}{1+K_{3}\tanh^{2}K_{2}\lambda} \tag{8}\]

Figure 20: Simulated time spectrum at a high voltage of 2.85 kV compared with one measured in the beam test with 180 GeV muons using 0.78 ns resolution TDC modules. The muon tracks are perpendicular to the detection plane and the horizontal axis of the plot has an arbitrary offset.

where \(\lambda=x/h\) is the distance normalized by the wire-cathode plane distance \(h\), and \(K_{1}\) and \(K_{2}\) are related to \(K_{3}\) by:

\[K_{1}=\frac{K_{2}\sqrt{K_{3}}}{4\text{arctan}\sqrt{K_{3}}},\hskip 56.905512ptK_{2}= \frac{\pi}{2}(1-\frac{\sqrt{K_{3}}}{2}), \tag{9}\]

where \(K_{3}\) is a parameter depending on the ratio between the wire-cathode plane distance (\(h\)) and wire-wire separation (\(s\)). Usually the FWHM of the cathode charge distribution is related to \(K_{3}\) and varies between \(1.3h\) to \(1.7h\). In reality, the induced charge spread on the cathode can be slightly larger due to multiple avalanches from different ionization clusters as well as the diffusion of ionized electrons in the gas volume.

In practice, in order to evaluate the charge spread width on the detector cathode, the strip response function (SRF), which is the integration of cathode charge density over the strip width, can be conveniently obtained by measuring the signal amplitude of on the strip as a function of the distance between incident track and strip center. The SRF for the determination of sTGC charge spread can also be obtained from the Garfield simulation. Assessment of the cathode charge distribution for inclined tracks and under magnetic fields in the simulation are also possible.

Simulation is performed by segmenting the whole sTGC cathode plane into fine pitch strips. The strip pitch is chosen to be 1.5 mm and is smaller than the expected charge spread width so that the accuracy will not be affected. The electric field together with the weighting field for each strip are generated using the finite element method to calculate the charge amplitudes. Muon tracks are uniformly generated across different strips. For each event, the charge on the strip is normalized by the total collected charge on the wire. The simulated ratio between the charge on the strip and the total charge on the wire as a function of distance between the muon hit position and the strip center for a perpendicular incident track is shown in Fig. 21(a). The distribution is well fitted by Gatti's function and can also be fitted approximately by a Gaussian function. The Gaussian fit of the SRF suggests that the raw induced charge spread on the cathode has a FWHM of 1.9 times the sTGC wire-cathode distance. This is wider than the distribution of the cathode charge induced by a single point charge deposited on the wire.

Figure 21: Raw induced charge spread on sTGC cathode plane.

The SRFs are also simulated for different muon incident angles and results are shown in Fig. 21(b), where \(\lambda\) is the normalized distance between the hit position in the middle of the chamber and the strip center. The track incident angles indicated refer to the angles with respect to the normal of sTGC in the plane both orthogonal to the wire plane and strips. Fitting of the SRF with a Gaussian function shows that the width is slightly increased from 1.9\(h\) to 2\(h\) as the track angle increases from 0\({}^{\circ}\) to 30\({}^{\circ}\). In addition, the SRF becomes asymmetric with inclined tracks. The asymmetry is believed to originate from different contributions to signals from the avalanches above and below the wire. For muon hits in the middle of the chamber equidistant on the left and right of a strip center, the avalanche centers above or below the wires in fact have different distances to the strip center hence induce different amount of charges on that strip. Avalanches on the side away from the strip are likely to be shielded by the wires and induce a smaller amount of charge on the strip.

The SRFs are also simulated with the presence of 1 T magnetic fields orthogonal to the wires, which potentially could modify the ionized electron drift path along the wire direction. The results are compared with those obtained without magnetic field in Fig. 22. As expected from the small Lorentz angle for sTGC operational gas, the shape of the charge distributions and their widths remain unchanged.

### Charge dispersion

Since sTGC strips only measure one coordinate of the muon tracks and because the resistive coating is supposed to have a uniform surface resistivity, the cathode and the readout strip plane can be treated as an one-dimensional \(R-C\) network where \(R\) and \(C\) are resistive layer resistance and resistive layer-readout plane coupling capacitance per unit length, respectively. For sTGCs, the unit length resistance is around a few tens of k\(\Omega\) and the coupling capacitance can be a few tens to a few hundreds fF depending on the thickness of the cathode insulator and its dielectric constant.

The evolution of current or charge density on the cathode plane due to a point charge deposited at \(x\)=0, \(t\)=0 and diffusing through a 1-D R-C network is given by the solution of the diffusion equation

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:21]

Based on the above model, a Monte Carlo simulation has been performed to simulate the charge sharing among strips by comparing the charge on the neighboring strip with that on the central fired strip. The general procedures are as follows: First, muon tracks with perpendicular incidence are generated uniformly from the center of one strip to half the strip pitch. It is therefore possible to identify the strips with second, third or fourth largest charge by comparing their distances to the muon track. Then the integration time is chosen to be the typical value of 25 ns and the raw induced charge spread on the cathode is fixed at the number derived from the Garfield simulation for calculating total charge deposition on each strip. The charge dispersion time constant is left as a floating parameter. The charge density function on each strip is finally integrated with the given integration time with a specific dispersion time constant and the ratios of charges between each strip and the central strip are obtained. Since in reality there is an uncertainty in charge determination due to noise, the charge ratio is smeared with a few percent of a Gaussian distributed fluctuation.

To permit comparison with the experimental data from a muon beam test performed in 2012 (charges on strips are linearly represented by ADC counts), the dispersion time constant \(\tau\) is tuned so that the mean value of the simulated second-to-maximum charge ratio is the same as the measu

Figure 24: The distributions of the ratios of charges induced on various strips to the maximum charge, e.g. \(\rm Q_{2nd}/Q_{max}\), ratio of second largest charge to largest, etc. The experimental data is measured with ADCs. Simulated distributions are obtained with a raw charge spread of 2.8 mm (FWHM) and a RC time constant of 6.5 ns.

of about 6.5 ns is suggested. Comparisons of the simulated and measured charge ratio distributions are shown in Fig. 24. The shape of the simulated second-to-maximum charge ratio distribution agrees well with the data. The distribution of the ratios for third, fourth and fifth maximum charges to maximum charge are found to be slightly smaller than the measured data. It is likely due to the unexpected larger spread of the raw induced charge as well as the inaccurate description of the charge profile using a Gaussian function. Both simulated and experimental data show that on average the second and third maximum charge strips can pick up charges equivalent to about 60% and 20% of the charge on the central strip with a pitch size of 3.2 mm.

### Pspice simulation

Another approach of assessing the validity of the developed analytical charge sharing model is to build the equivalent detector circuit model and simulating signal amplitude from different strips using Pspice[27]. The simulated sTGC current signals from Garfield can be used as inputs and the dispersed signal on the strips can be determined from their equivalent coupling capacitors. The schematics are illustrated in Fig. 25. Each resistor-capacitor cell represents certain length along the wire direction. The inputs of Garfield signals are from segmented cathode strips so the spatial extension of the raw induced charge is reproduced.

An example of simulated dispersing current signals from central and neighboring 3.2mm-pitch strips are seen in Fig. 26 when muon incidence is in the middle of the central strip and a dispersion time constant is 10 ns. The integration of currents on these strips indicate that the amount of charge collected on the second maximum charge strip is about 32% of the charge on the central strip. For using the analytic model, the value is calculated to be about 30%, which reasonably agrees with the results obtained previously.

## 7 Conclusion

Extensive simulations, including the electric field inside the chamber, electron transportation properties and charge production are performed in order to understand the operational principles of the sTGC detectors for the ATLAS nSW muon detector upgrade. Due to the strong electric field and small gas gap, most of the ionized electrons generated in the chamber will reach the wire within a few tens of nanoseconds. In addition, the amplification in the vicinity of the wire is sufficiently large so that the detector is sensitive to single clusters arriving at the wire. These features result in small time jitter together with fast collection of electron induced charges. Owing to the small Lorentz angle in the CO\({}_{2}\):n-pentane (55:45) gas mixture, the timing performance of sTGC are not expected to be affected by the presence of the magnetic field in the nSW. The foreseen operation at lower high voltage of around 2.8 kV, compared with 3.0 kV for the TGCs currently used in ATLAS, does not degrade its timing capability. However, the gas gain is estimated to be reduced to about 2\(\times\)10\({}^{5}\) and thus the detector will be actually running in the proportional mode instead of the saturated avalanche mode. Detailed simulation based on Garfield reproduce well a single layer sTGC detector time spectrum from a muon beam test. Results indicate that more than 95% of the total events can be identified within 25 ns in a single detector layer and thus fulfills the requirements for Level-1 triggering.

A simple analytical model has been developed to describe the charge sharing among sTGC strips. This includes the time structure of the charge development, raw induced charge spread on the cathode and its dispersion through the distributed resistive-capacitive network between the readout and cathode planes. Results show that with a few tens k\(\Omega\)/\(\Box\) cathode resistivity and \(\sim\)0.1 mm cathode-readout plane separation, charges will be spread out on 3-4 strips with a pitch size of 3.2 mm. Depending on the real situation that whether a linear representation of charge such as flash ADC or logarithmic-like representation such as time-over-threshold (ToT) will be implemented in the front end ASIC, the distance between the resistive cathode and the readout plane can be varied at a few hundreds of microns level to adjust the coupling capacitance hence the characteristic charge dispersion time. For instance, the use of ToT would prefer less dispersion of the charge so that the signals from central and neighboring strips can be distinguished.
