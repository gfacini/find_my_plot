**Abstract**

Three MDT chamber prototypes have been exposed to the H8 muon test beam during september 2001. This note describes the H8 setup and the performance of two such chambers, a BIL and a BML. We have studied the chamber calibration, the single tube resolution and efficiency,the electronic noise and their behaviour as a function of the HV and discriminator threshold. Although the analysis is still in progress, the first results show a good agreement with the expected performance.

Introduction

The Atlas muon spectrometer consists of a system of drift chambers, built with proportional tubes (monitored drift tubes, _MDT_) of different length and number. During the year 2001, the production sites have started the normal series production, which consists of a pre-series chamber (_module-0_), followed by the given quantity of modules.

The tightness of the requirements demands a careful evaluation of the quality of the production in a realistic environment. Moreover, it is urgent to test the integration between the precision chambers and the trigger detectors, to operate the prototypes of the electronic front-end and data acquisition and to check the procedure of geometrical alignment, slow control and calibration.

All these studies are naturally combined in a test-beam data-taking, which represents a necessary step in the spectrometer production and operation. The experimental program is split in successive phases. During the first data-taking period, individual chambers, operated with an external trigger, are read and calibrated individually. In the following periods the interest will focus on the integration with the proper trigger detectors and on the online monitoring, calibration and alignment.

In september 2001, three chambers have been equipped with the prototype electronics and exposed to the H8 muon test beam. This note reports some preliminary results of the analysis of the data for two of them, a BIL chamber built in Cosenza-Roma1-Roma3 and a BML chamber built in Frascati.

Section 2 describes the experimental layout, the detectors, the trigger and includes a brief summary of the data. Section 3 reports the results of the autocalibration of the chambers and the study of the resolution, efficiency and noise in "standard" conditions, i.e. with the gas mixture, HV and electronics parameters which represent the current baseline for the ATLAS operations. Section 4 and 5 contain a study of data in different conditions of HV and electronic threshold respectively. Finally, section 6 draws some conclusions.

Despite the short period devoted to the data analysis, it is already possible to establish some interesting conclusions. Moreover, we find necessary to give a fast report to important questions on the chamber operation and performance. Discussions on the autocalibration procedure and the computation of efficiency and noise, included in previous notes [1-7], will not be repeated here. Other notes describe the results of the tests with the cosmics particles [8], the readout of the prototype electronics [9], and the online software [10].

## 2 Experimental setup

The test was performed in the H8 beam test area at the CERN SPS, using 180 GeV/c muons. Following the beam direction, the muons hit the trigger detectors, a tracker chamber and finally the three MDT chambers. More details on the beam and the trigger are given in ref. [7].

We used alternatively two trigger devices. The small-area trigger, called _10\(\times\)10_ in the following, is given by the coincidence of the signals of two scintillators (10\(\times\)10 cm\({}^{2}\) and 10\(\times\)15 cm\({}^{2}\)) centered on the beam line. The large-area trigger (60\(\times\)100 cm\({}^{2}\)) is the coincidence of the signals of two planes of six scintillating slabs (10\(\times\)100 cm\({}^{2}\) each), vetoed by the _10\(\times\)10_ trigger. This second trigger is referred to as the _hodoscope_ trigger. On average, the trigger rates were 1.4 KHz for the _10\(\times\)10_ trigger and 2.0 KHz for the hodoscope.

A precision two-dimensional tracker chamber [11] was also used to get an independent observation of the tracks and to correct the measure in the MDT for the time of propagation of the signal along the anode wire. The results of the tracker chamber are not used in the present note.

The three MDT chambers (the two already quoted and a BOS chamber built in Munich) follow along the beam line. BIL (BML) consists of two multilayers of four (three) layers with 36 (56) tubes each. The chambers have been arranged in different setups. The data reported in this note refer to two layouts (see fig. 1) :

1. BIL positioned on a rotating platform and BML on fixed rails;
2. BIL and BML on fixed rails, allowing BOS to be mounted on the platform.

Since the autocalibration technique requires tracks at different angles with respect to the chamber plane [4], the first layout was used to calibrate the BIL chamber. The second layout was used to perform the calibration of the BOS chamber, while for BIL the previous result was retained.

In both layouts, the MDT chambers where positioned with the tubes vertical. The chamber x-coordinate is vertical and the z-coordinate is horizontal. The y-coordinate is at an angle (called \(\phi\) in the following) with the beam. The value of \(\phi\) was approximately 15\({}^{\circ}\) (BML and BIL in layout 2) or varying between \(\pm\) 40\({}^{\circ}\) (BIL in layout 1).

For the BIL and the BML chamber the gas is supplied by a mixer controlled by two flowmeters, whose maximum flow is 1300 Nl/h (Ar) and 130 Nl/h (CO\({}_{2}\)). The pressure is measured and controlled on the exhaust line by a precision meter with an accuracy \(\Delta p/p=10^{-3}\). The gas distribution inside the BIL chamber is not fully parallel, as foreseen in the Atlas present baseline, but it is arranged with three tubes serially connected using gas jumpers. The jumper impedence is \(\sim 20\) times smaller than the capillaries. For BML, one multilayer is fully parallel, while the other is similar to BIL.

The chambers are equipped with the present version of the standard MDT elctronics [13]. In the following we will refer to the nominal parameters. The electronic signals are fed in a chain (the _mezzanine_ board), consisting of a preamplifier, a shaper with 15 ns peaking time and a discriminator (_ASD_). The discriminated signals are measured by a TDC, also residing on the mezzanine, having a least count of 0.78 ns. The digitized hits are then sent to the chamber service module (_CSM_), hosted in a standard VME crate, through a cable adapter. In this version of the electronics, no discriminator dead time was set. In section 3.5 we will refer to a standard dead time of 800 ns.

Due to the problems encountered in operating this preliminary version of the electronics, a limited number of tubes have been equipped, typically 12 (16) tubes per layer in BIL (BML). These tubes have been chosen in such a way to fully cover the beam spot of the _10\(\times\)10_ trigger. In order to operate the BIL chamber with low HV noise, nitrogen has been continuously flown in the Faraday cages. No such treatment was found necessary for BML.

The "standard" operating conditions1 are defined by :

Footnote 1: In section 4 and 5 we will discuss the change of conditions for the HV and threshold scan.

* gas : Ar (93%) CO\({}_{2}\) (7%) at 3 bar absolute pressure;
* gas flow : 500 Nl/h, equivalent to \(\sim 8\) volume changes/day (BIL), 500 Nl/h, equivalent to \(\sim 5\) volume changes/day (BML)2; Footnote 2: Contrary to the other parameters, this condition does not reproduce the standard ATLAS baseline.
* high voltage : 3080 V, equivalent to a gain of \(2\times 10^{4}\)[14];* threshold : 60 mV, equivalent with this gain to the arrival of the 20\({}^{th}\) primary electron [13].

The chambers were equipped with 8 temperature sensors each. Some results of the temperature corrections are shown in the next sections.

More than 13 million triggers have been collected. Table 1 shows the main available data sets.

## 3 Chambers performance

The MDT calibration has been discussed in detail elsewhere [7]. It consists of two steps. First, for each individual tube, the time distribution of the hits is fitted to measure the minimum and maximum drift times, in order to equalize different tubes. Then, assuming an approximate function for the drift velocity, the best straight line, tangent to the circles representing the hits of a chamber in one event, is computed with the \(\chi^{2}\) method. By minimizing the average residuals to the fit, the best time-to-space relation (in the following called _r-t relation_) is measured. Results as the check of the drift properties of the tubes, the chamber resolution and efficiency, the noise level are also produced by the calibration procedure.

The study reported in this section has been performed on the samples A and G of table 1.

### Individual tube time spectra

For each hit, the _measured time_ is defined as the value recorded by the TDC of the tube, minus the value of a TDC which measure the time of the trigger (the same value for all the hits of the same event). A large constant is then added, to cope only with positive numbers. Fig. 2 shows a typical time distribution of the hits for a single tube which receives a constant particle density. For each tube, only the first hit in the event is plotted. The time window which corresponds to hits induced by particles (called _physical time window_ in the following) is well visible above a small background, due to the electronic noise, which will be discussed later. We will refer to the start and the end of the physical time window as \(t_{0}\) and \(t_{1}\) respectively, and to its length as \(t_{max}=t_{1}-t_{0}\). The non-linearity of the r-t relation for the Ar-CO\({}_{2}\) mixture is evident in the distribution.

Table 1: List of available data sets.

Following the method described in [4], the spectra of fig. 2 are fitted with an appropriate function, which contains as parameters \(t_{0}\) and \(t_{1}\). The rise time (10 \(\div\) 90 %) is fixed to 13 ns.

The value of \(t_{0}\) does not depend on the drift characteristics of the tube. Its only use is to equalize the drift times of nearby tubes, which participate in the computation of the same r-t relation. However, nearby tubes share the same front-end electronics and are expected to have very similar values of \(t_{0}\). Fig. 3 shows the value of \(t_{0}\) as a function of the tube identifier. It is evident that tubes in the same mezzanine have a \(t_{0}\) which is similar at the _ns_ level, while the large step between tubes 6 and 7 of the first multilayer corresponds to a different mezzanine.

A change of the mezzanine board or in the trigger type results in a different \(t_{0}\) in the same tube. Also the operation of switching off and on again the same electronics may change the value of \(t_{0}\) by \(\pm 12.5\) ns for all the channels in the same mezzanine.

Contrary to \(t_{0}\), the value of \(t_{max}\) depends only on the drift properties of the tube. It is therefore an ideal quantity to monitor, in order to check the correct behaviour of the chamber. Fig. 4 (obtained from the hodoscope triggers of the sample G of table 1) shows the distribution of \(t_{max}\) for all the equipped tubes of the BIL chamber. Its r.m.s. amounts to 2 ns. It is comparable with the statistical error in the determination of \(t_{max}\), which is dominated by the error on \(t_{1}\).

With respect to ref. [7], in similar conditions, the average value of \(t_{max}\) has decreased by \(\sim 15\) ns. This difference corresponds to the expected variation for a change in the gas mixture by 0.2 % [14]. No such effect is expected within a single data-taking period.

In the BML chamber the fit of \(t_{max}\) results in values tipically 10 ns larger than in BIL. This is due to the combination of two different time distributions for beam particles traversing the tubes on the left or on the right side of the wire. This effect can be produced by the stress on

the tubes to compensate for the wire gravitational sag that was applied when the chamber was assembled in the horizontal position. Since in the beam the BML chamber was positioned with the tubes vertical and at a \(\phi\) angle of about 15\({}^{\circ}\), the effect was visible and the wire eccentricity was measured to be about 560 \(\mu\)m.

### Temperature effects

At constant pressure, a change in temperature induces a variation of the drift velocity and hence of the reconstructed hit position. In particular, for the value of \(t_{max}\), from [14] one finds \(dt_{max}/dT\simeq-2.4\) ns/K for this gas mixture and the standard parameters. The presence of the temperature sensors allows such a study. The group of 20 tubes with highest statistics in the _10\(\times\)10_ trigger data is selected, and the quantity \(t_{max}^{*}\), their average \(t_{max}\) in each short data-taking period is defined. In fig. 5 the values of \(t_{max}^{*}\) are plotted as a function of the temperature. The best fit to the points, also shown in the figure, has a slope \(dt_{max}^{*}/dT=-2.3\pm 0.1\) ns/K.

The agreement between the prediction and the measures, which represents also a test of the control of tiny systematic effects, allows us to correct the data taken at different values of the temperature, e.g. in the angular scans discussed in the next sections.

### Autocalibration

The second step in the chamber calibration is the computation of the r-t relation. It has been performed by the CALIB program [12], which follows closely the method discussed elsewhere (cfr. e.g. [7]).

In order to measure the single tube resolution, tracks with eight consecutive hits are selected in the BIL chamber. One hit is excluded from the fit and a straight line is computed from the remaining seven measurements. Then, the fitted line is compared to the excluded hit. Fig. 6 shows the scatter plot of the distance between the line and the measurement, as a function of the drift path. Since the tracks are almost orthogonal to the chamber, the inefficiencies near the wire reflect the lack of acceptance of the two nearby layers. The plot is then divided in slices of drift path. Each distribution is fitted with a gaussian, whose standard deviation \(\sigma\), after subtracting in quadrature the average contribution of the extrapolation error, is taken to

represent the resolution of the individual tubes in the given drift path range. As an example, fig. 7 shows the distribution of the residuals for few intervals of drift path, together with its fit. Since the tube resolution is independent from the angle \(\phi\) of the chamber, values at different \(\phi\) have been averaged for the final result, in order to minimize their statistical errors. No check of the systematics has been performed yet. Fig. 8 shows the chamber resolution, as a function of the drift path. Also the results of the fast method discussed in section 3.4 are included in the figure. The line represents the result of the Garfield [15] computation. This computation also shows that the resolution component due to the diffusion is negligible in the first half of the drift path, and reaches a maximum of \(\sim 40\)\(\mu\)m near the tube wall. The data show a good agreement with the prediction, apart for the region \(7\div 13\) mm of drift path, where the data are larger than the expected values by about 15 \(\mu\)m.

Fig. 9 displays a typical event in the BIL chamber. Both the hits and the fitted track are shown.

The single tube efficiency has been computed with the tracks reconstructed by the CALIB program. A tube is considered inefficient when either no hit is present, or the distance between the first hit in the event and the track is larger than three times the hit resolution. As shown in fig. 10, with this definition the single tube efficiency, averaged over the full drift path, is typically 97%. Fig. 11 shows the efficiency as a function of the drift path for a tube of BIL. The large inefficiency near the tube wall is clearly visible. The drop of the efficiency with the drift path is interpreted as a result of the \(\delta\)-ray production. Only in \(\sim 10^{-3}\) of the cases, the inefficiency is due to the absence of any hit in the considered tube.

### The tube resolution with the fast method

As discussed in ref. [5], the test beam setup allows a simpler computation of the single tube resolution. For a sample of tracks, almost parallel to each other, the tube resolution is simply related to the difference between the times measured for the same track in two non-consecutive layers of the same multilayer. Moreover, if the tracks are orthogonal to the chamber (i.e. the \(\phi\) angle is small), the two drift times are approximately equal. With these assumptions, the resolution can be computed in a simpler way, without the need of a sample of reconstructed tracks\({}^{3}\) :

\[\sigma_{r}(r)=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\ v_{d}(r)\ \sigma_{t}(r) \tag{1}\]

where \(\sigma_{r}(r)\) is the required resolution as a function of the drift path, \(v_{d}(r)\) the drift velocity, roughly measured by the tube time spectrum and \(\sigma_{t}(r)\) is the r.m.s. width of the difference between the two time measurement.

We have computed the resolution with this second method (called _fast method_), in order to compare it with the CALIB method under standard conditions, and applied it in the HV and threshold scan, when the angular scan was not performed. Fig. 8 shows the results of the two methods. Apart from the regions of very small and very large drift paths, where the fast method is intrinsically unreliable [5], the good agreement between the two methods justifies the use of the fast method in sections 4 and 5.

### Electronic noise

An important check of the quality of the new electronics is the amount of noise in the data. Clearly, the H8 environment lacks the radiation levels expected in the ATLAS cavern. Therefore, one expects that almost all the hits not in coincidence with physical particles are due to uncorrelated electronic noise. In practice, we compute the frequency of noise for a given tube by interpolating the level of the background in fig. 2 before and after the physical time window and by normalizing this quantity to the total number of events considered :

\[f_{noise}=\frac{1}{\Delta T\ n_{triggers}}\ \int_{\overline{PhW}}\ n_{ hits}(t)\ dt \tag{2}\]

where we are considering the distribution of fig. 2, with \(n_{ hits}(t)\) representing the complete distribution, \(\overline{PhW}\) the complement of the physical time window, \(\Delta T\) the length of \(\overline{PhW}\) and \(n_{triggers}\) the total amount of triggers in the data sample.

The distribution of \(f_{noise}\) for the tubes of the BIL and BML chambers is shown in fig. 12. For a typical BIL tube, \(f_{noise}=1\div 5\times 10^{3}Hz\), which corresponds with the standard dead time to a probability \(\leq 4\times 10^{-3}\) that a physical hit be obscured by a spurious one.

The noise level at the input of the electronics chain, when superimposed to a physical hit, also affects the time resolution. For the series electronics, we expect a value of the equivalent noise charge (_ENC_) of 5000 electrons [13].

## 4 High voltage scan

The drift and noise properties of the chambers are affected by the electric field. Therefore, we have taken data at different values of the HV setting, ranging from 3080 V (the standard value) to 3400 V, in order to better understand these characteristics (data set C of table 1).

Fig. 13 shows three quantities for a typical tube of both the BIL and BML chambers. The value of \(t_{0}\) (fig. 13a) is weakly affected by the variation of the electric field. It decreases slowly when the HV is increased, due to the small path of the primary electrons which contribute to the threshold for events near \(t_{0}\). The almost constant difference between BIL and BML depends on the difference between different mezzanine boards, as shown e.g. in fig. 3.

The HV variation is much more evident in the distribution of \(t_{max}\) (fig. 13b). For the Ar-CO\({}_{2}\) mixture \(t_{max}\) is almost proportional to the inverse of the electric field [14] (\(t_{max}\propto(v_{drift})^{-1}\propto p/E\)). In this approximation, as confirmed by the data, the product \(t_{max}\times HV\) is constant. The data shown in the plot have been corrected for the temperature variation, with the method described in section 3.2. The systematic difference in \(t_{max}\) between the BIL and BML chambers has been already commented in section 3.1.

Finally, the level of noise (fig. 13c) also increases at the highest HV. This increase is not related to signals from particles, always larger than the threshold, nor to multiple hits, since only the first hit of the event enters in the computation of the noise.

In fig. 14a the single tube resolution, computed with the fast method discussed above, is plotted as a function of the drift path. With respect to the present standard of 3080 V, an

Figure 13: Results of the threshold and high voltage scans. The change in \(t_{0}\), \(t_{max}\) and the noise frequency are shown for the BIL (\(\bullet\)) and BML (\(\star\)) chambers for both scans (a,b,c : high voltage scan, d,e,f : threshold scan).

increase in high voltage helps in the region near the wire, where the higher gain results in a lower effective threshold, and therefore in a smaller dependence on the fluctuations in the ionization.

## 5 Threshold scan

The variation of the discriminator threshold (data set B of table 1) provides complementary informations to the HV scan. The same fig. 13 shows the dependence of the quantities already studied for a variation of the threshold between 38 and 98 mV.

The variation of \(t_{0}\) (fig. 13d) depends on the change in the required number of primary electrons. Therefore, an increase in threshold induces a small increase in \(t_{0}\), which is visible in the plot.

Instead, \(t_{max}\) (fig. 13e) is affected by larger measurement errors, which obscure its dependence on the threshold, expected to be similar to \(t_{0}\). The temperature correction has been applied also in this case. As in the HV scan, the \(t_{max}\) shows a systematic difference between the BIL and BML chambers.

The dependence of the noise level on the threshold (fig. 13f) shows the presence of two different regimes. Up to \(40\div 50\) mV there is evidence for an exponential decrease with the increase of the threshold, while above it the noise is constant. The exponential regime, probably due to the electronic noise, has a different threshold for the two chambers. In the cavern environment, the noise component due to the radiation, which most likely will not show any dependence on the threshold, will dominate the background.

The single tube resolution is shown in fig. 14b. As expected, lowering the threshold improves the resolution, expecially for small drift paths.

## 6 Conclusions

Some preliminary results of the H8 test beam for the BIL and BML chambers are presented.

The chambers have been calibrated and muon tracks have been reconstructed. The drift properties of the different tubes, checked by measuring the minimum and maximum drift times, are equal at the level of few nanoseconds. The single tube resolution, as measured after the tracking, is about 55 \(\mu\)m near the tube wall. The single tube efficiency is \(\sim 97\%\), mainly due to the \(\delta\)-ray production. The electronic noise in a single tube is at the KHz level, which results in a fake hit probability of \({\cal O}(10^{-3})\).

The data taken with different values of HV and discriminator thresholds show the expected trends. In particular, if the series production of the electronics confirms the present level of noise, the resolution of the tube near the wire could be sensibly improved by choosing a lower value of the discriminator threshold.
