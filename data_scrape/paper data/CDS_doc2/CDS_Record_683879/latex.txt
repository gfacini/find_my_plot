Using the information from the Cs calibration runs, many of the problems affecting the response of the barrel Module0 prototype have been spotted out. These can be bad fibre-tile couplings, light losses from fibres bundling, broken fibres, not transparent tiles etc. After a visual inspection, most of these problems have been repaired.

Introduction

A detailed study of the barrel Module0 response to a Cs source running through it, allows us to learn about problems and defects in the module instrumentations as well as about damages undergone during its use at the test beam.

These studies can be useful to improve the next Tile calorimeter modules instrumentation technique (spotting out the most frequent errors), as well as to improve the PMTs inter-calibration, once the defects are adjusted manually, whenever possible.

## 2 Cs Calibration

The Tile calorimeter is designed to allow a movable radioactive source to pass through every scintillator tile. Each scintillator tile has two holes along the simmetry axis; the source guide tube is inserted through one of them [1], as shown in figure 1 (where just one of the holes is visible).

In figure 2 the current induced in four PMTs (reading out four consecutive calorimeter cells) is shown as a function of the source position.

The multiple peak structure in the response of each PMTs is due to the passage of a 8 mCi \({}^{137}\)Cs source through individual tiles. The capability to see individual tiles are due to the mean free path of the \({}^{137}\)Cs \(\gamma\) emission, which is of the order of the 18 mm of iron that separate one tile from the next one.

Figure 2 demonstrates the power of this source scan of the calorimeter, in testing its quality and uniformity. The source can be seen by every scintillator

and therefore it can be used to obtain a precise picture of the response of the barrel Module0.

Two cases of faulty light collection from one tile is indicated with a circle. A first calibration run (20525) was performed to identify all the existing patologies. Several intermediate runs (from 20526 to 20587) were done to check from time to time the effects of the reparations. In run 20587 the defects which are still left (after various attempts to improve them) are visible.

## 3 Classification of the patologies

In the following sections, the main problems affecting the Module0 response are reported.

### fibres not properly coupled with the tiles

The most frequent problem found was due to the bad coupling between the fibres and the tiles. In many of these cases the fibres turned out to be nested between the scintillating tile and the iron (as shown in figure 3), and it was therefore necessary to correctly re-position the fibre and the profile. In some cases this was due to a profile which was not properly tightened, but the overall impression is that the profiles themselves were not perfectly suited to coherently guide the fibres along the tiles. The fibres could be pull-down by

the profiles into the space between tiles and masters when pressing down the whole profile in the final assembling.

A possible solution would be to use a little drop of glue (like the one which is used at the top-end of the profiles far away from the PMTs) to fix the fibres with the profiles, at their end.

### Broken fibres

It was found that the signal from five tiles in tube 11 and four tiles in tube 10 was missing. A visual inspection allowed us to identify nine broken (cut) fibres. To repair them, after a careful polishing, the two broken ends were inserted in a small tube of Teflon (1.2 mm external diameter, 1.0 mm internal diameter, 1.0 cm length). On one end, a drop of glue 1 was used, and the two fibre end-sides were pushed head-on-head.

There were other fibres suspected to be damaged. In tubes 7 and 9, the same pattern of irregularities in the response of cell BC6+ (+ means positive \(\eta\) side) has been found. Since corresponding tiles in these cells are read-out by the same fibres in the two tubes, it was suspected that the attenuation of the light response could be due to the fibres themselves. Figure 4 shows the light-transmission recovery after gluing the broken fibres for cells D+1, tube 10. In this case, an overall recovery of 57% is achieved.

Footnote 1: The glue used was Bicron Optical Cement BC600. Specifications can be found at the following address: [http://www.bicron.com/bc600.htm](http://www.bicron.com/bc600.htm)

### Effects due to radiation leakage

This is an already known effect. Due to the semi-projective cell structure of the central sampling of Module0 the light-response/per cell decreases in most of the cells in tube 6. As shown in figure 5, at the very beginning, the response of most of the cells in tube 6 (where this effect is very strong) is due to the signal leakage from another cell. When the source reaches the cell under study, the response is due to the previous cell leakage plus the real signal from the cell under study. Only when the source is far away enough from the previous contributing cell, the response of the cell under study is due to the real signal.

### Bad quality tiles

Only two tiles were identified to be of bad quality, since the response from both up and down PMTs was degraded. One of them (tube 8, cell BC6+)was clearly darker than usual (and therefore it was inserted -and not rejected - by mistake). For the second one (size # 6, cell BC9+), the transparency problem was not immediately visible by eyes. Only a carefull examination using a light source to test the tile transparency allowed to spot the problem.

### Bundling with different type of fibres

The step-behaviour of the light response for cell D0 in tube 10 and 11, is due to the presence, in the same bundling, of fibres of different types: Bicron and Pol.Hi.Tech, which have a different response, mainly due to the different aluminization quality.

### Unidentified problems

In some cases (like for cell BC6+ in tube 7) the problem has not been identified. The down PMT response presents a step behaviour. Since the up PMT has a normal response, problems with the tiles can be excluded. It could be a problem at the level of fibres bundling, but this cannot be checked since it is not possible to extract the drawer that far.

## 4 Improvements after the reparation

Tables 1,2,3 report the problems found, as well as their seriousness and the status after a manual intervention. The first two tables show the situation for all the interesting tiles (from tube 1 to 11) in the positive \(\eta\) side of the barrel Module0. Table 3 is the same, but in the case of the negative \(\eta\) side. Figures from 8 to 18 show the effect of the interventions, comparing the cell responses during the first Cs run, with that after the last Cs run.

Out of the 181 problems spotted out in Module0, 159 have been fixed or improved (88% of the total). The overall effect of the intervention on Module0, is shown in figure 6, where the relative difference of the integral of the PMTs current over one cell, in the case of two consecutive runs is plotted for all the cells (on the left). The same relative integral difference between the first Cs ru taken (20525) and the last one (20587) is plotted in the same figure, on the right. The improvement is clearly visible. As an example, the relative integral difference for the repaired problem in tube 4, cell BC5+ (PMT down) has the value of.6\(\cdot\)10\({}^{-1}\).

Table 3: _List of the problems identified from tube 1 to tube 11 in the response of Module0 (negative \(\eta\) side._Single-tile response test

As an additional exercise, it was tried to understand what is the response of a single tile 2.

Footnote 2: Note that this response includes the optical fibre and PMT response as well as the effects of all the couplings present: tile-fibre and fibre-PMT.

The shape of this response is of particular interest, since the result obtained here, can be compared with the results coming from the usual fitting procedure, normally used to extrapolate the individual tile response from the Cs data 3

Footnote 3: The parameterization normally used in the fit is equal to Signal = A\(\cdot\) e\({}^{(1/\Lambda)\cdot|x|}\) with A and \(\Lambda\) constants.

To do this test, several optical fibres were de-coupled from their scintillator by shielding them with an aluminum foil. A first Cs run was taken in this condition to estimate the background level (namely, the signal coming from these fibres not in direct contact with their scintillator). As a second step, one of these optical fibres (the one in the center position between all the decoupled fibres) was put back in contact with the scintillator. After a second run was taken, all the de-coupled optical fibres were re-positioned and a third run taken.

This exercise has been repeated twice: first by de-coupling a set of only five fibres, and secondly by de-coupling a set of 11 fibres.

In the first case, the background signal was by far, away from being a "plateau" distribution, due to the presence of leakages among tiles within the same row. For this reason, the second set of runs was taken removing more fibres.

At the beginning, the whole cell structure was fitted with the usual symmetric exponential. Being the only region of interest the one with the de-coupled fibres, some peaks of the full structure were cut-out and the remaining structure was fitted.

The individual tile response was found by subtracting the module response in the first run (the "background signal"), to the second one (background + single tile response). Since the source speed was not very stable, the response structures in the two cases did not match at all.

The two structures were "shifted" in order to find the largest single tile response. This value, was taken as the "hardware" individual tile response, and the structure found was fitted with the symmetric exponential function as well.

The single tile response isolated in this way was then compared with the one obtained with the usual fit. An agreement at the level of 5-6% was found.

Conclusions

The interventions to fix all the spotted problems have been carried out giving in most cases positive results (88% of the 181 problems found were solved). Most of the defects are related to the bad fibre-tile coupling.

The situation at the end of the autopsy operation is summarized in figures from 8 to 18, which show the comparison of the currents measured in the PMTs before (plots above) and after (plots below)the intervention on Module0.

The isolated response of a single tile was found to be in agreement (within 5-6%) with the one obtained by fitting the whole cell structure.
