###### Abstract

This note describes a Monte Carlo implementation of the process \(gg\to t\bar{t}\) with subsequent leptonic decay of at least one of the \(t\) or \(\bar{t}\). A lowest order effective \(CP\) violating interaction is introduced in the \(gt\bar{t}\) vertex. Complete tree level matrix elements are used such that the \(CP\) violation can be mediated by the \(t\bar{t}\) spin correlation and detected in the final state decay products.

Introduction

The possibility of beyond the Standard Model interactions that could introduce \(CP\) violation in \(t\overline{t}\) events has been under intense study during the last 10 years. For a comprehensive overview of the topic see for example reference [1]. One excellent opportunity to test this hypothesis will come with that start of the LHC. The LHC will be a \(t\overline{t}\) factory producing millions of events that can be used for the high precision measurement that will be needed in order to put stringent bounds on \(CP\) violating interactions. In this case the interactions are modeled by the chromoelectric dipole moment (CEDM) which effectively parameterizes the lowest order interactions. In order to study the experimental requirements and estimate the sensitivity of the detector a dedicated Monte Carlo generator is needed that can reproduce the LHC events in a realistic way.

An analytical calculation of the tree level process \(gg\to t\overline{t}\), see reference [5], shows explicitly that the \(CP\) violation is mediated by the \(t\overline{t}\) spin correlation. This spin correlation is, due to the nature of the weak interaction and the fact that the top decay before hadronizaton, reflected in the final state decay products. The \(t\overline{t}\) spin correlation is present already in the Standard Model (SM) but is not included in the standard Monte Carlos like PYTHIA [2], ISAJET [3] or HERWIG (version \(<\) 6.4) [4]. With the CEDM parameter turned off, TOPSPIN can be used for ordinary SM spin correlation studies. However this particular implementation was written for the purpose of estimating the ATLAS sensitivity to \(CP\) violating \(gt\overline{t}\) interactions.

## 2 Effective theory

In order to be as model independent as possible the choice was made to use the effective theory approach to the problem of modeling \(CP\) violation in \(t\overline{t}\) production at the Lagrangian level (see e.g. reference [6, 7]). There are three operators at leading order of mass dimension six that are relevant for the LHC environment. They are however, after applying the SM equations of motion, all equivalent up to four-point fermion vertices [8] which can be safely neglected, particularly since the gluon fusion production is dominant. The operator is

\[{\cal O}_{tG}=\vec{q}_{L}\sigma^{\mu\nu}t_{\ R}\tilde{\Phi}G^{a}_{\mu\nu}T^{a} \tag{1}\]

in the common SM notation, i.e. \(q_{L}\) is the left-handed \(SU(2)\) doublet containg the third family left-handed quarks \(t_{L}\) and \(b_{L}\), \(t_{R}\) is the right-handed \(SU(2)\) singlet, \(\Phi\) is the Higgs field where \(\tilde{\Phi}=i\sigma_{2}\Phi^{*}\), \(G^{a}_{\mu\nu}\) is the gluon field tensor, and \(T^{a}\) are the \(SU(3)\) generators. With this operator a real valued effective Lagrangian term of mass dimension four can be constructed

\[{\cal L}_{6} = \frac{1}{M^{2}}(\alpha_{tG}{\cal O}_{tG}+\alpha_{tG}^{*}{\cal O}_ {tG}^{\dagger}) \tag{2}\] \[= \frac{v}{\sqrt{2}M^{2}}\overline{t}\sigma^{\mu\nu}\{\Re\alpha_{ tG}(P_{R}+P_{L})+i\Im\alpha_{tG}(P_{R}-P_{L})\}t_{\mu\nu}T^{a} \tag{3}\]where \(M\) is an arbitrary mass scale (here \(M\) is set to \(m_{t}\)) and \(\alpha_{tG}\) is the coupling constant, the helicity projection operators are \(P_{R,L}=\frac{1+\gamma_{5}}{2}\), and \(v\) is the Higgs vacuum expectation value after electro-weak symmetry breaking. This is dynamically equivalent to the mass dimension five Lagrangian [16]

\[{\cal L}_{5}=-\frac{C_{5}}{2}\overline{t}\sigma^{\mu\nu}tG^{a}_{\mu\nu}T^{a}-i \frac{D_{5}}{2}\overline{t}\sigma^{\mu\nu}\gamma_{5}tG^{a}_{\mu\nu}T^{a} \tag{4}\]

where \(C_{5}\) is the chromo-magnetic dipole moment (CMDM) and \(D_{5}\) is the chromo-electric dipole moment (CEDM). CEDM is \(CP\)-odd and hence the leading order contribution for the parametrization of the \(CP\) violation, while CMDM is \(CP\)-even and does not violate \(CP\). The relations between the constants in \({\cal L}_{6}\) and \({\cal L}_{5}\) are

\[C_{5}=-\frac{\sqrt{2}v}{M^{2}}\Re\alpha_{tG}\ \mbox{and}\ D_{5}=-\frac{\sqrt{2}v}{M ^{2}}\Im\alpha_{tG} \tag{5}\]

The couplings \(C_{5}\) and \(D_{5}\) are not dimensionless. A practical definition of dimensionless couplings of order one (\(c_{t}\),\(d_{5}\)) are

\[C_{5}=g_{s}\frac{c_{t}}{m_{t}}\ \mbox{and}\ D_{5}=g_{s}\frac{d_{t}}{m_{t}} \tag{6}\]

where \(g_{s}\) is the strong coupling constant.

## 3 Feynman rules

To calculate the new matrix elements for the Monte Carlo generator the first thing to do is to extract the Feynman rules. The Lagrangian \({\cal L}_{5}\) generates two additional Feynman rules apart from the Standard Model. They can be read off directly from the Lagrangian and are

\(V_{1}=-ig_{s}\sigma^{\mu\nu}(\frac{ic_{t}}{m_{t}}-\frac{d_{t}}{m_{t}}\gamma_{5 })q_{\nu}T^{a}\)

\(V_{2}=g_{s}^{2}\sigma^{\mu\nu}(\frac{ic_{t}}{m_{t}}-\frac{d_{t}}{m_{t}}\gamma_ {5})f^{a\,bc}T^{c}\)The vertex \(V_{1}\) modifies the original \(gt\bar{t}\) vertex and the vertex \(V_{2}\) is a new 4-point vertex not present in the Standard Model. \(f^{abc}\) are the \(SU(3)\) structure constants. Please note that this definition of \(V_{2}\) requires strictly real and constant couplings. The imaginary part of the couplings must be zero below the threshold of on shell gluons, hence non zero complex couplings imply \(q^{2}\) dependence and higher orders in the mass dimensions. The extra Lorentz structures needed for a constant imaginary part above the threshold are given in reference [1] but are not included here.

## 4 Calculation of squared matrix elements

The dominant production mode at LHC is \(gg\) fusion (90%), therefore the small \(q\bar{q}\) contribution can safely be neglected. Actually, the only matrix element that needs to be calculated is \({\cal M}(gg\to bl^{+}\nu_{l}\bar{b}l^{-}\bar{\nu_{l}})\). There is also another useful mode when one of the \(W\) decays hadronically, but the difference is just a constant factor of \(3|V_{ud}|^{2}\) for the \(|{\cal M}|^{2}\). The main Standard Model diagrams with purely leptonic \(W\) decays are shown in Figure 1. When \({\cal L}_{5}\) is added there is one more diagram that includes \(V_{2}\). There are 200 additional Standard Model diagrams tha contribute to this final state, which in principle are needed in order to maintain complete gauge invariance. However, these diagrams only contribute when the resonances are far off-shell and since the widths are small they can be neglected.

The calculation of the complete amplitude including the spin effects is non trivial

Figure 1: The four types of diagrams included in the calculation of \(|{\cal M}|^{2}\), here shown for the lepton + jet decay topology. Dotted vertices represents the anomalous couplings. The lower diagram includes the additional four-point vertex \(V_{2}\) that is not present in the Standard Model.

analytically. One approach that makes the calculations less complex is given in reference [9]. It is also possible to do the full calculation by the CompHEP [15] package. However, as soon as extra terms beyond SM is included in the calculations of six particles in the final state the technique becomes far too slow. The technique used in this implementation is to use numerical calculation of each helicity amplitude (HA). This is extremely efficient and even enables the calculation of all the 204 diagrams if needed. Each diagram can be factorized in subsequent function calls HA by HA. The otherwise heavy operation of computing the \(|{\cal M}|^{2}\) is replaced by a simple numerical complex conjugation and scalar multiplication. The HELAS library [10] is used for the HA calculations and the skeleton of function calls with proper color factors are generated by MadGraph [11]. Please notice that the version MadGraphII is needed in order to have the HA listed in color flows.

The new vertices \(V_{1}\) and \(V_{2}\) are included as new function calls with code generated by MAPLE, see Appendix B. The definition of MAPLE code closely links the analytical expression for the vertices with final HELAS function calls and also includes code to reproduce the original HELAS SM vertices to verify the notation.

The running of \(g_{s}\) is calculated by the PDFLIB [13] function ALPHAS2 at the scale \(Q^{2}=m_{t}^{2}+p_{t}^{2}\). In order to be consistent all calculations are made with PDFLIB and the structure functions CTEQ5M.

## 5 Phase-space integration

The events are generated by the well known cross-section formula [12]

\[d\sigma=f^{g}\,(x_{1})f^{g}(x_{2})dx_{1}dx_{2}\frac{(2\pi)^{4}|{\cal M}|^{2}}{ 4\sqrt{(p_{1}\cdot p_{2})^{2}-m_{1}^{2}m_{2}^{2}}}\delta^{4}\,(P-\sum_{i}^{n}p _{i})\prod_{i}^{n}\frac{d^{3}p_{i}}{(2\pi)^{3}2E_{i}} \tag{7}\]

The matrix elements are given by the Feynman rules. The modulus square is for helicity amplitudes just the average over the initial helicity states, a sum over final amplitudes followed by a complex conjugation and a scalar multiplication. \(f^{g}\,(x)\) is the gluon probability density function [13] of the proton and x is the longitudinal momentum fraction carried by the gluon. In practical applications a more critical issue is that of the parametrization of the phase space during integration. The fundamental problem can easily be understood from first principles. The integration over phase space is approximated by the mean value theorem of integrals

\[\int_{a}^{b}f(x)dx=(b-a)<f(x)> \tag{8}\]

where the average integrand \(<f(x)>\) is found by random sampling within the integration volume \((b-a)\). Now, the integral error will of course depend on the fluctuations of \(<f(x)>\). Suppose that we know that \(f(x)\) contains a peak \(g(x)\) such that \(f(x)=h(x)g(x)\), where h(x) is almost constant. Then we can do the following variable transformation

\[\int_{a}^{b}f(x)dx=\left\{y(x)=\int_{0}^{x}g(x^{\prime})dx^{\prime};\frac{dy} {g(x)}=dx\right\}=\int_{y(a)}^{y(b)}h(y^{-1})dy \tag{9}\]

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:7]

## 6 Unweighted event acceptance

Given an almost uniform cross-section distribution in all phase space dimensions it is straight forward to accept events with the correct probability. Select randomly and uniformly points in phase space in the new transformed variables. The fluctuations should hence be small. To account for the small remaining irregularities in the event distribution the usual unweighting procedure is applied, i.e

1. Select randomly a seed in the interval \([0,\sigma_{\it max}]\).
2. Accept if the current phase space configuration is above the seed.

The final efficiency reached for the unweighted event production within the complete phase space volume is 5%.

## 7 The PYTHIA interface

The TOPSPIN generator does not handle the initial and final state radiation, beam remnants, the tau decay or the quark fragmentation process. This is handled by PYTHIA by implementing the TOPSPIN process as an external PYTHIA process PYUPEV following the procedure described in the PYTHIA manual [2]. The scale for the initial state radiation is set to \(Q^{2}=m_{t}^{2}+p_{t}^{2}\) and the fragmentation scales are set to the resonance masses.

For the tree level top quark production there are only two leading color flows given by the \(s-u\) and \(s-t\) diagrams respectively. The color flow is randomly selected before PYTHIA string fragmentation according to the amplitude squared for that particular flow.

Figure 2: The 1-sample estimation of the total cross-section as a function of the phase space variable \(q=\sqrt{s}\) before regularization. The peak is located at \(2m_{t}\).

The leptonic decay channel is randomly selected with an equal weight for electrons, muons and taus.

## 8 Comparisons with CompHEP and PYTHIA

In order to verify the results the CEDM \(|\mathcal{M}|^{2}\) for the process \(gg\to t\bar{t}\) using HELAS have been compared with the \(|\mathcal{M}|^{2}\) calculated by CompHEP. Notice that the only input to CompHEP are the vertices \(V_{1}\) and \(V_{2}\), see Appendix A. Up to the numerical accuracy the two calculations yield the same \(|\mathcal{M}|^{2}\) for each phase-space configuration. This proves the correctness of the MAPLE definition in Appendix B and also asserts that the vertices \(V_{1}\) and \(V_{2}\) are added with the correct phases. The inclusion of the top decay process is completely orthogonal to these results since it only implies a few extra HELAS function calls added later in the factorisable decay chain.

The output of the TOPSPIN process in SM mode, i.e. \(c_{t}=d_{t}=0\), has been compared to the default \(t\bar{t}\) PYTHIA process for \(gg\to l^{+}l^{-}X,ljX\), see Figures 3-5 and Table 1. Minor differences are seen in the width of the top and in the jet \(p_{t}\) spectra, however these should not be significant for the studies of \(CP\) violation.

The total cross-sections also agree at the Tevatron energies with the cross-sections presented in [16], except that the minimum of the cross-section and center

of the ellipse is at \((c_{t},d_{t})=(-0.2,0)\) and not \((-0.4,0)\). These numbers are not completely equivalent since \(q\vec{q}\) is missing, but the dominating contribution to \(\Delta\sigma\) is from \(gg\) which is confirmed by explicit CompHEP calculations at the Tevatron energies using the correct \(p\vec{p}\) structure functions. In particular, the point of weak sensitivity to \(CP\) violation at (-0.6,0.2) and the existence of \(\Delta\sigma=0\) at (-0.18,0.18) is verified. For an overview of the cross-sections at the LHC energies see Table 2.

CompHEP implementation of CEDM

Modifications to the Standard Model in order to incorporate CEDM in CompHEP. Please notice that CompHEP cannot implement four-point gluon vertices. They are instead split by the use of auxiliary fields into three-point vertices. The version used is 41.10. The CompHEP source code has to be modified and recompiled if more than 5 particles are present in the final state. It is important to use Feynman gauge if there are many final state particles. The actual procedure for modifying the model parameters in CompHEP is described in the CompHEP [15] manual. The modifications are

## Appendix B MAPLE calculations of HELAS vertices

The HELAS library consists of function calls that encapsulate all SM vertices and propagators. The CEDM is implemented as modified vertices with code generated by MAPLE, see below. The convention is that the HELAS code e.g IOVXXXX is replaced by IOVUUU. For further details see [10]. Two vertices must be replaced, IOVXXX and FVOXXX. Please notice that the MAPLE definitions below can be used for other modifications of the SM vertices as well since it provides a fast link between the standard theory descriptions and the HELAS code.
