###### Abstract

A study of the signal width of a Higgs particle in the four lepton decay mode is presented. Corrections to TDR significance estimates are calculated. These corrections are found to lead to a reduction in significance estimates of up to 40 % in regions where the natural line shape of the Higgs dominates the reconstructed signal width.

Introduction

In order to understand the origins of a heavy Higgs or Higgs-like particle found in ATLAS, correct measurements of production rates and natural widths are of primary importance. For instance, if the proposed RS radion exists [1], its signature would be similar to a Standard Model (SM) Higgs, except for a much enhanced production rate and a different total width. Obviously, the SM Higgs has been studied to quite some detail early on as presented in the physics Technical Design Report (the TDR) [2]. It seems very appropriate to use this work and scaling factors to establish the discovery potential for Radions in ATLAS. This is what has been done in [3].

The TDR relies on an approximate analytical expression for resolution, and assumes a gaussian signal shape when calculating efficiencies. It is therefore appropriate to verify this assumption by direct simulation. In this note we present such a verification study and establish corrections to significances given in the TDR. Signal and background processes were generated using Pythia 6.1. ATLAS acceptance and resolutions were simulated using the ATLFAST package. A detailed account of this study is found in [4]. Following this work, a verification study was performed by activating ATLFAST through the ATHENA framework. In order to provide a direct comparison, the TDR cuts were imposed in both cases and it was verified that both ways of using ATLFAST gave consistent results.

## 2 Mass Resolutions and Signal Efficiencies

First, single particle energy/momentum resolutions were derived by shooting single electrons and muons through the detector at different momenta and studying ATLFAST reconstructed output. It was verified that the resolutions were gaussian with widths as assumed ATLAS TDR documents. Then, Higgs-like particles decaying to four electrons or four muons were generated at fixed masses, ignoring natural widths and initial/final state radiation effects. Particles were generate at masses ranging from 200 GeV to 600 GeV. Distributions for reconstructed masses are plotted in fig. 1. The mass resolutions obtained are plotted in fig 2.

The study was then repeated with ISR/FSR effects turned on. Fig. 3 shows reconstructed mass spectra for masses of 400 and 600 GeV. It is seen that a gaussian description of the mass resolution is not fully appropriate anymore. In particular for the four electron final state, a low energy tail is clearly visible, since, in this case ISR/FSR effects dominate over the excellent energy resolution for electrons. It is not any longer appropriate to use a single gaussian fit to describe resolution. A better idea of the resolution is given by the simple r.m.s. of the distribution. In fig. 4 we show the sigmas of the single fit gaussians together with r.m.s. spread of the reconstructed distributions. The TDR assumption of a mass resolution of \(0.02m_{H}\) for the four lepton final state is also plotted. It is seen that this assumption is relatively reasonable as an average for the three kinds of leptonic final states anticipated (\(eeee\), \(ee\mu\mu\) and \(\mu\mu\mu\)).

Finally, examples of the SM Higgs were generated with its the natural width turned on. For large mass Higgses, the natural width of the Higgs dominates, and a fit to a Breit-Wigner distribution gives a good description of the reconstructed mass distribution, as seen in fig. 5. The TDR assumption is that the overall mass resolution can be described by a single gaussian with a width given by \(\sigma_{m}=\sqrt{\frac{\Gamma_{H}}{2.36}^{2}}+(0.02m_{H})^{2}\), and that the signal efficiency within a mass window of \(\pm 1.64\sigma_{m}\) around \(m_{H}\) will be 90 %. It is stated that a more thorough study should account for the Higgs' natural width when establishing signal efficiencies.

Selecting the TDR mass window, fig. 6 shows the selection efficiencies obtained. It is clearly seen that these are far from 90% for high masses. This is not surprising, in view of the fact that for a Breit-Wigner distribution, only 60% of the events are contained within a mass window of \(\pm 1.64\times\frac{\Gamma_{H}}{2.36}\) around the mass, not 90% as is the case for a gaussian.

## 3 Backgrounds and discovery potentials

In order to estimate significances we also performed an independent simulation of the background inside the selection criteria defined in the TDR. This is relatively simple since, in these channels, the only important background is the irreducible continuum production of ZZ pairs. Keeping the mass window as defined in the TDR, significances were calculated for integrated luminosities of \(30fb^{-1}\) and \(100fb^{-1}\) and compared to the TDR results. The result of this comparison is shown in table 1 and plotted in fig 7. PYTHIA 6.1 cross-sections for the signal are also given in the table. The total background cross-section with no requirement on the ZZ mass was found to be 82.3 fb. Here the PYTHIA 6.1 results was multiplied with 1.3 to account for the gg contribution. In this study, the correct mixture of \(eeee\), \(ee\mu\mu\) and \(\mu\mu\mu\mu\) final states was used, and an identification efficiency of 0.9 per lepton was assumed (like in the TDR). A total of 50000 background events, and 50000 signal events for each Higgs mass were generated to produce the table.

Clearly, the mass window chosen in the TDR is rather ad. hoc., and a different choice of mass window may result in the recovery of some of the significance lost due the the

A study was undertaken to see how significances would vary when changing the window. Figs. 8 and 9 show the results. These figures demonstrate that mass windows chosen are quite close to the optimal ones. An improvement of 5 to 10 % for a high mass higgs might be achieved using the cut and count method inside a mass window defined in a different way than in the TDR study.

In this context we would like to remark that all though the chosen strategy is reasonable for making predictions about signal significances for different masses of the higgs, such a procedure may lead to false conclusions when applied to real data. For real data one has to be very cautious in order to avoid picking up statistical fluctuations. To tailor a mass window to enhance the significance of a marginal signal is a classic example of how to make an incorrect conclusion.

## 4 Conclusions

An independent study of Higgs production in the 4l final state is presented. It turns out that a correct account of the Higgs lineshape leads to significant changes in the efficiency estimates compared to TDR values. In mass ranges where the Higgs natural width dominates over the intrinsic detector resolution these corrections lead reductions in signal significances of up to 40 %. Background contributions are estimated at about the same level as previously found.

It must be remarked that a cut and count analysis is very simplistic. Proper fits of the mass distribution to a lineshape over a large mass range may result in the recovery of some of the lost significance due to the tails of the Breit-Wigner, and may also be a sounder approach to the real data. It seems appropriate to investigate alternative and more powerful methods for finding new particles in ATLAS than the brute force methods used here and in the TDR. Here there is a wealth of experience from the LEP searches at hand.

In view of constraints on the SM Higgs mass given by precision measurements, one might argue that a high mass Higgs-like particle will not be the SM Higgs at all, and hence the widths will be different from the SM width in any case. In this likely scenario, one should still be aware of the fact that a correct account of the natural width of new particles is necessary for reliable estimates of discovery potentials.
