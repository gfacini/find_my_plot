Abstract

The sensitivity of the ATLAS experiment for a discovery of the Standard Model Higgs boson in the weak boson fusion qqH with \(\mathrm{H}\rightarrow\tau\tau\) and \(\tau\rightarrow\mathrm{e}\),\(\mu\) is studied.

The tagging of two high energy forward jets and a veto of soft jets in the central region of the detector provide powerful tools for background suppression. In addition the two lepton final state with missing energy allows the reconstruction of the Higgs mass with a resolution of 10%.

Signal and background rates as well as the final signal significance are evaluated for a Standard Model Higgs boson in the mass range between 110 and 150 \(\mathrm{GeV}\).

Motivation

The discovery of the Higgs boson and the understanding of the electroweak symmetry breaking are major goals of the ATLAS experiment.

For the low Higgs mass range (110 - 150 GeV) the important search channels are the direct two-photon channel, \(\mathrm{H}\to\gamma\gamma\), the four lepton channel, \(\mathrm{H}\to\mathrm{ZZ}^{*}\to 4\)\(\ell\), and the channels where the Higgs boson is produced in association with a weak vector boson or a \(\mathrm{t}\bar{\mathrm{t}}\) pair. In these channels, both the \(\gamma\gamma\) and \(\mathrm{b}\bar{\mathrm{b}}\) decay modes can be discovered at the LHC. If the Higgs boson has a mass in the low range a few years of operation at low luminosity (\(L=10^{33}\mathrm{cm}^{-2}\mathrm{s}^{-1}\)) are needed to discover the Higgs boson. The Higgs production via gluon fusion has the largest cross section at the LHC and most of the Higgs discovery channels make use of this production channel, but only a few handles exist to distinguish the signal process from the overwhelming QCD background. A detailed discussion of the Higgs discovery potential at ATLAS can be found in [1].

The second largest cross section for the Standard Model (SM) Higgs boson is predicted for weak-boson fusion (WBF), \(\mathrm{qq}\to\mathrm{qqVV}\to\mathrm{qqH}\), see Figure 1.

A diagram of the Higgs production in WBF is shown in Figure 2. The events contain additional information in the quark jets which are observable in the forward region of the detector. Because there is no colour exchange between the initial-state quarks, the hadron production in the central region is suppressed. This feature can be used as a veto on additional jet activity in the region between the two quark jets against QCD background.

This note describes the first analysis of \(\mathrm{H}\to\tau^{+}\tau^{-}\) within the Standard Model in ATLAS. A parton level analysis with reasonable detector efficiencies at the LHC has been discussed for the \(\mathrm{H}\to\tau^{+}\tau^{-}\to\mathrm{e}^{\pm}\mu^{\mp}\not{p}_{T}\) channel [3] concluding a 5 \(\sigma\) sensitivity to the Standard Model Higgs boson for an integrated luminosity of 30 \(\mathrm{fb}^{-1}\) per LHC experiment. \(\mathrm{H}\to\tau^{+}\tau^{-}\) event characteristics are analysed here for both \(\tau\) decaying leptonically. The channel with one \(\tau\) decaying hadronically and one into an electron or a muon is currently under study. The detection of the Higgs boson decaying into \(\tau\) leptons enlarges the discovery potential in the low mass region. Higgs masses above \(\mathrm{m_{H}}=160\) GeV are not accessible.

The analysis of \(\mathrm{H}\rightarrow\tau^{+}\tau^{-}\) events increases also the spectrum of measurements of the Higgs boson couplings. Due to the production mechanism the WBF is sensitive to the couplings of the Higgs to the W/Z boson as well as to the \(\tau\)-leptons. Work is in progress to combine all available channels and to evaluate the potential of ATLAS in measuring the Higgs boson couplings.

## 2 Analysis

The analysis presented here is based on the fast simulation ATLFAST of the ATLAS detector [4]. The default parameter setting for ATLFAST is used. The charged lepton identification efficiency is assumed to be 90% for electrons and muons. The forward jet tagging and the central jet veto are critical tools in this analysis. Their efficiencies are studied with a full GEANT simulation of the ATLAS detector [5]. The difference to the ATLFAST prediction is taken into account by a correction factor. The forward tagging efficiency correction is given as a function of transverse momentum and pseudo rapidity of the jets, while the central jet veto correction is parametrised as a function of the threshold of the transverse momentum of the veto jet, the pseudo rapidity region and the luminosity.

### Background contributions

There is a large number of background processes with two jets, two leptons and considerable missing momentum. The background processes can be classified as EW and QCD processes and events where the leptons originate from real \(\tau\) decays or from other sources, e.g. from heavy quarks. The most important background contributions are listed in Table 1 and a selection of diagrams of the dominant background processes is shown in Figure 3.

The following cuts together with the cuts 1 are applied to ensure maximum acceptance to observe the signal events inside the ATLAS detector.

\[p_{Tj}\geq 50\ {\rm GeV},\quad p_{Tj}\geq 20\ {\rm GeV},\quad \big{|}\eta_{j}\big{|}\leq 5.0\] \[\eta_{j_{1}}\cdot\eta_{j_{2}}<0,\quad\eta_{j,min}+0.7<\eta_{\ell_{ 1,2}}<\eta_{j,max}-0.7,\quad\eta_{tags}=\big{|}\eta_{j_{1}}-\eta_{j_{2}}\big{|} \geq 4.4 \tag{2}\]

, where \(\eta_{max}\) and \(\eta_{min}\) are the maximum and minimum \(\eta\) of the two tagging jets or leptons. The jets as well as the leptons are ordered by their transverse momentum. The transverse momentum and pseudo rapidity distributions for the leading tagging jet and lepton are shown for the signal process (\(\rm{m_{H}}=120\) and 140 GeV) in Figure 6.

A sketch of a signal event in the \(\eta\)-\(\phi\)-plane (Figure 4) shows a positron and a muon in the central region of the detector and two jets in the forward region.

At this stage the large background from \(\rm{b\overline{b}}\) events is already reduced by cutting on the \(p_{T}\) of the leptons. Requiring a significant amount of missing transverse momentum in the event the \(\rm{b\overline{b}}\) background can be neglected. The \(\rm{\not p}_{T}\) distributions for the signal and remaining dominant background processes are shown in Figure 7 after the cuts of Eq. (2). Based on these the additional cut

\[\rm{\not p}_{T}>50\ {\rm GeV} \tag{3}\]

is imposed. QCD processes at the LHC typically occur at smaller invariant jet masses than EW processes. This is due to the dominance of gluons at small x in the proton. A lower bound on the invariant mass of the forward jets reduces the QCD backgrounds:

\[M_{jj}>700\ {\rm GeV}. \tag{4}\]

The distributions of invariant mass of the forward jets for the signal and dominant background processes are shown in Figure 8 after the cuts of Eq. (3).

Due to the absence of colour exchange between the two scattered quarks in EW processes, which include the Hqq signal, we expect soft gluon emission mainly in the very forward region. For QCD processes, soft gluon radiation occurs mainly in the central detector. A veto against additional jets in the central region of the detector (\(\rm{jet^{veto}}\)) with \(p_{T}\geq 20\ {\rm GeV}\) rejects the QCD backgrounds with much higher probability than the EW signal process.

\[p_{Tj}^{\rm veto} > 20\ {\rm GeV}\.\] \[\eta_{j,min}^{\rm tag} < \eta_{j}^{\rm veto}<\ \eta_{j,max}^{\rm tag}\quad. \tag{5}\]

Figure 4: A sketch of a signal event in the \(\eta\)-\(\phi\)-plane.

A different implementation of the central jet veto is possible by using the balance of the transverse momentum \(p_{T_{all}}\). Since EW processes tend to have small values of \(p_{T_{all}}\), the QCD backgrounds can be found at higher values due to soft gluon radiation.

\[\vec{p}_{T_{all}}=\vec{p}_{T_{1}}+\vec{p}_{T_{2}}+\not{p}_{T}+\vec{p}_{T_{j_{1}} }+\vec{p}_{T_{j_{1}}}\]

This method is less sensitive to pile-up events and makes the usage of the analysis possible also at the design luminosity of \(10^{34}\)cm\({}^{-2}\)s\({}^{-1}\). Since the sensitivity is lower, the veto of Eq. (5) on jets is used here. The effect of the method on the number of expected signal and background events after all cuts is described in section 2.10 and listed in Table 10.

The electroweak process Zjj is very similar to the signal process Hqq. Since the Z is a vector particle and the H a scalar boson, the angular distributions between the scattered quarks differ. A cut on \(\phi_{jj}\), the azimuth angle between the tagging jets, is applied to reduce the Zjj (EW) background which prefers back to back jets. The distribution of \(\phi_{jj}\) is shown in Figure 9.

\[\phi_{jj}<2.2. \tag{6}\]

Another significant difference between signal and some background processes is the angular distribution of the charged decay leptons relative to each other. In the case of the Higgs signal, the high \(p_{T}\) of the Higgs boson results in a pair of \(\tau\)'s which are emitted fairly close together. Therefore the selection requires

\[\Delta R_{e\mu}<2.4\,, \tag{7}\]

where \(\Delta R_{e\mu}\) is the distance between the leptons in the \(\eta\)-\(\phi\)-space. The cut reduces primarily the \(\overline{\rm t}\overline{\rm t}\) and \(WW+jets\) backgrounds. Figure 10 shows the \(\Delta R_{e\mu}\) distributions for signal and background processes.

The remaining background can be reduced significantly by a cut on the reconstructed \(\tau\) pair invariant mass. The large mass of the decaying Higgs boson and its large transverse momentum results in high velocities of the \(\tau\)'s from the Higgs boson decay and therefore the approximation that the lepton direction is close to the \(\tau\) direction can be made (collinear approximation). As shown in Figure 5 the transverse momentum of the Higgs boson \(p_{T_{Higgs}}\) is given by the vectorial sum of charged lepton \(p_{T}\)'s and missing transverse momentum.

It is possible to extract the fractions of the two \(\tau\) momenta which are carried by the two charged leptons. These momenta fractions are in the following labelled as \(x_{\tau_{1}}.x_{\tau_{2}}\) and can be expressed

Figure 5: The transverse momentum of the Higgs boson \(p_{T_{Higgs}}\) is in the “collinear approximation” given by the vectorial sum of charged lepton \(p_{T}\)’s and missing transverse momentum.

by the transverse momenta of the Higgs boson and the leptons.

\[p_{T_{Higgs}}= p_{\tau_{\tau_{1}}}+p_{\tau_{2}}+\not{p}_{T}\] \[x_{\tau_{i}}= \frac{p_{T_{top}i}}{p_{\tau_{i}}}\] \[x_{\tau_{1}}= \frac{p_{T_{top}1,\,x}\cdot p_{T_{top}2,\,y}-p_{T_{top}1,\,y} \cdot p_{T_{top}2,\,x}}{p_{T_{Higgs},\,x}\cdot p_{T_{top}2,\,y}-p_{T_{Higgs}, \,y}\cdot p_{T_{top}2,\,x}}\] \[x_{\tau_{2}}= \frac{p_{T_{top}1,\,x}\cdot p_{T_{top}2,\,y}-p_{T_{top}1,\,y} \cdot p_{T_{top}2,\,x}}{p_{T_{Higgs},\,y}\cdot p_{T_{top}1,\,x}-p_{T_{Higgs}, \,x}\cdot p_{T_{top}1,\,y}}\]

The reconstruction works only if the \(\tau\)'s are not emitted back to back in the transverse plane. Otherwise the momentum vectors are linearly dependent and the denominator becomes zero. A cut requires a minimal acoplanarity of the lepton pair

\[\cos\phi_{e\mu}\;>\;-0.9\;. \tag{8}\]

For \(\tau\) decays the reconstruction must yield \(0<x_{\tau_{1,2}}<1\), apart from detector resolution effects. For leptons originating from W's the collinear approximation is not valid because the \(W\)'s and top quarks receive only modest boosts. In this case a significant fraction of events is reconstructed with \(x_{\tau_{1}}<0\) or \(x_{\tau_{2}}<0\). Many others end up in the unphysical region \(x_{\tau}>1\). Figure 11 shows the \(x_{\tau_{i}}\) distribution for the signal of \(\mathrm{m_{H}}=120\) GeV and various background processes. The plots show the difference between leptons from \(\tau\) decay and leptons coming from W decays. Selected events must fulfil the relations:

\[x_{\tau_{1}},\;x_{\tau_{2}}>0\;,\;\;\;x_{\tau_{1}}^{2}+x_{\tau_{2}}^{2}<1\;. \tag{9}\]

Once the momentum fractions carried by the \(e\) and \(\mu\) are known, the invariant mass of the \(\tau\) pair is given by

\[m_{\tau\tau}=m_{e\mu}/\sqrt{x_{\tau_{1}}x_{\tau_{2}}}\;.\]

To illustrate the quality of the "collinear approximation" Figure 12 shows the invariant \(\tau\) pair mass distribution at parton-level with ATLFAST reconstruction and for ATLFAST events for the signal of \(\mathrm{m_{H}}=120\) GeV and \(140\) GeV for the \(\mathrm{e^{\pm}}\mu^{\mp}\not{p}_{T}\) final state. The reconstructed \(\tau\) pair invariant mass distributions are shown in Figure 13, after cut of Eq. (9). The \(Z+jj\) events are strongly peaked at \(m_{\tau\tau}=m_{Z}\). When searching for a Higgs boson mass peak well above \(m_{Z}\), the background is drastically reduced if one requires

\[\mathrm{m_{H}}-10\;\mathrm{GeV}\;<\;m_{\tau\tau}<\;\mathrm{m_{H}}+15\;\mathrm{GeV} \tag{11}\]

The mass range is chosen asymmetrically because of the high mass tail of \(Z+jj\) events.

4.2 The \(\mathrm{H}\to\tau^{+}\tau^{-}\to\mathrm{e^{+}e^{-}}\not{p}_{T},\mu^{+}\mu^{-} \not{p}_{T}\) channel in WBF

The cuts applied to select the \(\mathrm{e^{+}e^{-}}\not{p}_{T},\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\not{p}_{T}\) final state are similar to those discussed in the previous section. To reject background events from Z decaying into \(\mathrm{e^{+}e^{-}}\) or \(\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\) a cut on the invariant mass of the lepton pair is applied in addition:

\[m_{\ell\ell}<m_{Z}-15\;\mathrm{GeV}\;. \tag{12}\]

Invariant mass distributions for the signal and \(Z\to\mathrm{e^{+}e^{-}},\mu^{+}\mu^{-}+\mathrm{jets}\) processes are shown in Figure 14.

The cut on \(\Delta\phi_{jj}\) (eq. 6) is not applied for these channels since the sensitivity would be slightly worse, even if the signal to background ratio is improved.

### Estimate of the systematic uncertainty of the background

The QCD background contributions quoted in the previous sections have been evaluated using the PYTHIA parton shower Monte Carlo. Due to the requirement of two hard tag jets in the final state the final number of predicted background events is sensitive to the hard tail of the jet distribution in \(\mathrm{t\overline{t}}\) +jets or Z+jets.

In order to get an estimate for the systematic uncertainties of the dominant QCD background predictions, the background has also been calculated using explicit matrix element calculations. These matrix element calculations have been provided by the authors of Ref.[3] and have been interfaced to the PYTHIA generator.

For both the \(\mathrm{t\overline{t}}\) +jets and Z+jets background we estimate a factor of 2.0 higher cross section after all cuts than the values determined in the PYTHIA parton shower approach. The uncertainty is not incorporated into the calculation of the signal significance. In the worst case the significance can drop by a factor of two.

Given these major uncertainties on the absolute level of background, it is important to determine this background directly in the experiment.

For the largest background contributions Zjj (QCD) events for small and \(\mathrm{t\overline{t}}\) events for high masses of the Higgs boson, the corresponding mass spectra have to be known both in shape and in absolute normalisation. The Zjj cross section can be measured from \(Z\to\mathrm{e}^{+}\mathrm{e}^{-}\) or \(\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\) + jets events, while the shape of the mass spectrum can be studied in \(Z\to\tau^{+}\tau^{-}\), \(\tau\to\mathrm{e}\) (\(\mu\)) \(\nu_{e,\mu}\nu_{\tau}\) events. The \(\mathrm{t\overline{t}}\) background can be studied at high reconstructed masses and extrapolated to lower masses. In total the systematic uncertainty of the background is expected to be less then 15% for a data sample of more than 10 fb\({}^{-1}\) of integrated luminosity by accounting for the statistical uncertainty in the reference samples.

### Estimate of the Monte Carlo statistical uncertainty of the background

To estimate the statistical uncertainty on the total background toy Monte Carlo based on 100 000 pseudo-experiments are used. The number of events passing the cuts and corresponding to a given background have been randomised according to a Poisson distribution. A distribution of the total background events is then obtained by summing all rescaled background contributions. The distribution for 30 fb\({}^{-1}\) is shown in Figure 18 for \(\mathrm{m_{H}}=120\) GeV and \(\mathrm{m_{H}}=140\) GeV. The width is a direct measurement of the statistical uncertainty of the total background. The number of expected background events are evaluated with a Gaussian fit. The statistical uncertainty of the background is about 15% for \(\mathrm{m_{H}}=120\) GeV and 20 % for \(\mathrm{m_{H}}=140\) GeV.

Results of the selection \(\mathrm{H}\to\tau^{+}\tau^{-}\to\ell^{+}_{i}\ell^{-}_{j}\not{\mathrm{p}}_{T}\)

The results of the analysis are summarised in Table 3, which shows the effect of the cuts described in section 2.4. The final results are corrected for a more realistic response of the ATLAS detector studied with a full GEANT simulation [5]. The correction is applied on the forward jet tagging efficiency as a function of the pseudo rapidity and the transverse momentum of the jet. Furthermore the central jet veto efficiency is corrected to consider pile-up contributions. After all cuts the largest background arises from Zjj (QCD) events for small masses and \(\mathrm{t\overline{t}}\) events for higher masses of the Higgs boson.

The numbers of expected signal and background events for integrated luminosities of 10, 30 and 60 fb\({}^{-1}\) are given in Table 5 together with the significance. The total number of signal andbackground for various masses of the Higgs boson and all final states can be found in Table 6. The difference in the number of expected signal events for the various channels is due to the different trigger requirements for electrons and muons. The statistical significance obtained for all channels separately and a combination are shown in Table 5 and Figure 16.

A small contribution to the number of selected events arises from Higgs production via gluon fusion. The expected number of events for an integrated luminosity of 10fb\({}^{-1}\) are given separately for the vector boson fusion and the gluon fusion in Table 4. For the estimation of the significance of the observation one may add the two contributions. However for the determination of the Higgs coupling both contributions need to be disentangled, i.e. the contribution from gluon fusion is considered as a background process. Since gluon fusion only contributes with less the 10% (assuming Standard Model couplings of the Higgs boson) the effect on the sensitivity is small and here we conservatively quote numbers for significance of the observation neglecting this contribution.

For the combination of all channels the significances are added in quadrature. The luminosity needed to reach a sensitivity of 3 \(\sigma\) and 5 \(\sigma\) is shown in Figure 17. The highest sensitivity for the Higgs boson can be achieved for about m\({}_{\mathrm{H}}\) = 120 GeV. To illustrate the visibility of a Higgs boson (m\({}_{\mathrm{H}}\) = 120 GeV) in the data a pseudo experiment has been carried out to generate a mass distribution. The number of events after the cuts for integrated luminosities of 10 and 30 fb\({}^{-1}\) have been randomised according to a Poisson distribution. Each event has been randomised to the mass spectrum for the signal and the background, see Figure 15.

### Comparison with the parton level analysis

A parton level analysis with a reasonable approximation of the detector efficiencies at the LHC has been discussed for the \(\mathrm{H}\to\tau^{+}\tau^{-}\to\mathrm{e}^{\pm}\mu^{\mp}\,\not{p}_{T}\) channel by Zeppenfeld et al, referred as _Zepp._ in the following. In this section the results of the parton level analysis are compared to the analysis described in this note. For the comparison the cuts are taken from Ref [3], and the lepton identification efficiencies are set to 90% for electrons and muons. The parton level analysis used fixed value for the jet tagging efficiency, which can result in differences in the expected cross sections.

Table 7 shows the cut flow for the signal and two background processes for both analyses. Some differences occur since the parton level analysis neglects effects from ISR/FSR. Gluon radiation lowers the momentum of the jets, thus the efficiency of the cut on the invariant dijet mass decreases. Another source of discrepancy stems from the invariant \(\tau\) pair mass spectrum as shown in Figure 12 and Table 8. ISR/FSR effects lead to a broader spectrum of the invariant \(\tau\) pair mass.

In addition to the standard cone size for jet finding (0.4), a value of 0.7 is used for the signal process. The numbers are given for a sample without ISR/FSR and a sample where partons are reconstructed with ATLFAST. The overall agreement is within 25% for the signal process.

### Results with lower trigger requirements

Since the ATLAS trigger framework is still under development, physics analyses can lead to a better understanding of trigger requirements to enlarge the spectrum of the physics program of the ATLAS project. To test the effect of lower trigger requirements for this analysis the cuts on the transverse momenta of the leptons are changed to \(p_{T_{1,2}}\geq 10\) GeV. Table 9 shows the number of signal N\({}_{S}\) and background events N\({}_{B}\) and significance for an integrated luminosity of 30 \(\mathrm{fb}^{-1}\) and \(\mathrm{m_{H}}=120\mathrm{~{}GeV}\). A comparison with the results listed in Table 5 demonstrates that the increase in signal efficiency is about 7% and the significance is slightly higher for lower cuts. Nevertheless, lower trigger thresholds enable the study of background processes in a more precise way.

### Results for a high luminosity environment

At the design luminosity of \(10^{34}\mathrm{cm}^{-2}\mathrm{s}^{-1}\) more than one interaction will occur during the same bunch-crossing. Extra jets with low transverse momentum can veto events and reduce the acceptance. As described in section 2.4 a veto on additional central jets can be replaced by a cut on the total transverse momentum \(p_{T_{all}}\). Table 10 shows the results of the selection for an integrated luminosity of 30 \(\mathrm{fb}^{-1}\) and 100 \(\mathrm{fb}^{-1}\), where a cut \(p_{T_{all}}<30\mathrm{~{}GeV}\) is applied. The results for 30 \(\mathrm{fb}^{-1}\) are corrected for a low luminosity environment, while the results for 100 \(\mathrm{fb}^{-1}\) take the effect of pile-up in a high luminosity environment into account, see [5]. The effect of a reduced missing energy resolution on the reconstructed Higgs mass at high luminosity is not studied in detail.

## 3 Conclusion

The results presented in this note demonstrate that ATLAS has a potential for the observation of a Standard Model Higgs boson in the channel \(qqH\to qq\tau^{+}\tau^{-}\to qq\ell^{+}_{i}\ell^{-}_{j}\) in the intermediate mass region. An integrated luminosity of 38 \(\mathrm{fb}^{-1}\) is needed to achieve a significance of 5 \(\sigma\) if the Higgs boson exist with a mass of 120 \(\mathrm{GeV}\), where the systematic uncertainty of the background is not taken into account.

The systematic uncertainty of the background was studied with matrix element calculations and a factor of two higher cross section was found than with the PYTHIA parton shower approach. Is important to measure the background contribution in the experiment to reduce this uncertainty.

Detailed simulations of the ATLAS detector are used to evaluate the tagging efficiency of the forward jets as well as the veto efficiency for central jets. The comparison with a parton level analysis described in [3] shows reasonably good agreement.

The combination with the \(qqH\to qq\tau^{+}\tau^{-}\to qq\ell^{\pm}had^{\mp}\) channel and the channel where the Higgs boson decays into W bosons in weak boson fusion will increase the discovery potential. The study of the Higgs production in weak boson fusion allows the determination of the couplings of the Higgs to the W/Z boson and to the \(\tau\)-leptons. This results are important for a better understanding of the nature of the electroweak symmetry breaking mechanism.
