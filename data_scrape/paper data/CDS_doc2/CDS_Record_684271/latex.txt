###### Abstract

The Hadronic Tile Calorimeter [1] is readout using a dual gain ADC which allows to measure single cell signal ranging from \(\simeq 100\)\(MeV\), corresponding to about 0.2 MIP, up to \(\simeq 1.5\)\(TeV\). Jets that release single cell signal higher than \(\simeq 1.5\)\(TeV\) saturate the ADC. The analysis described in this note shows that it is possible to correct for saturation effects allowing to enlarge by a factor about three the ADC dynamic range. The results presented are based on data acquired during July test beam period.

Introduction

The aim of the study presented in this note is to enlarge the ADC dynamic range to be able to measure jets that produce single cell deposit \(\simeq 3\,TeV\). The concern that this type of events at LHC could be as frequent as a few per year is the basic motivation of this study.

The analysis here described is based on the CIS (Charge Injection System) events acquired during the test beam period of July 2001. In these events the signal is generated by applying a tension, ranging from 0. \(V\) to 4.096 \(V\), to a capacitor (\(C_{in}\) ) placed at the input of the the shaper circuit. The applied tension is controlled by a DAC level. Two values of the input capacitors are used, 5 \(pF\) and 100 \(pF\), allowing to cover the whole dynamic range with finer resolution for low injected charge. The input tension is varied in 4 \(m\,V\) steps. The injected charge is thus defined as :

\[Q_{in}\left(pC\right)=\frac{2\cdot 4.096\cdot\left(C_{in}+C\right)\cdot N}{1023} \tag{1}\]

where \(C_{in}\) indicates the input capacitance measured in pC, \(C\) is the stray capacitance of the circuit having a value of \(\simeq\ 0.13\)\(pF\)[2] and \(N\) the DAC level. The injected charge (\(Q_{in}\) ) r ranges from 0.66 \(pC\) to about 820 \(pC\), for each value of \(Q_{in}\) about 250 events are recorded.

The shaped signal is amplified and sampled 9 times at 25 \(ns\) intervals. Figure 1 shows the shape of the signal as recorded with the oscilloscope [3] (left ) and the sampled signal in a CIS event (right ).

For each event in CIS run both \(high\) and \(low\) amplificat

The ADC dynamic range is 10 bits and the ratio between _high_ and _low_ amplification is 64.

The first sample for _high_ gain saturates for injected charge \(\simeq 10\ pC\) while the _low_ gain signal, in these events, never reaches saturation. In what follows it is shown that it is possible to extend the linearity for _high_ gain signal up to \(\simeq\ 40\ pC\). The method obtained to extend the dynamic range for _high_ gain can then be applied to _low_ gain signals allowing to extend the ADC linearity up to \(\simeq\ 2400\ pC\).

## 2 Looking at saturated events

The analysis discussed in this note is based on CIS run 0100142 where the signal of channel 38 is analyzed. A first cut is applied to reject events with a bad phase, the problem related to the phase control is under investigation [2]. Pedestal value for _low_ and _high_ gain are calculated fitting the signal of the first sample for all values of injected charge. The values obtained in ADC counts are \(pe\,d_{low}=114\pm 2\) and \(ped_{high}=126\pm 1\).

Figure 2 shows the number of saturated samples as a function of the injected charge for _high_ amplification. Saturation of the first sample occurs for \(Q_{in}=12.2\ pC\) and of the second one for \(Q_{in}=14.6\ pC\). Saturation of the second sample occurs with a small increase of the charge injected since the the signal width is about twice the sampling frequency. For convenience a definition of the

signal (\(S5\)) slightly different from the standard one has been used :

\[S5=\sum_{i=3}^{7}s_{i} \tag{2}\]

where \(s_{i}\) is the amplitude of sample \(i\) pedestal subtracted. For each event the following variables are also defined :

\[S4 = S5-m_{1} \tag{3}\] \[S3 = S4-m_{2}\] (4) \[S2 = S3-m_{3} \tag{5}\]

where \(m_{i}\) are the single sample signal \(s_{i}\) ordered with decreasing amplitude. Figure 3 shows the scatter plot of \(S5\) to \(S2\) as a function of \(Q_{in}\).

When the first saturation occurs \(S5\) is attenuated but the linearity can be recovered using \(S4\) and, as \(Q_{in}\) increases, \(S3\) or \(S2\). The recover of linearity is traded with a small loss in amplification. The corrected signal (\(CS5\)) when 1, 2 or 3 samples are saturated is thus obtained from \(S4\), \(S3\) or \(S2\) applying a correction factor calculated fitting with a linear function the dependence of \(S4\), \(S3\) and \(S2\) on \(Q_{in}\) (Figure 3 left ). \(CS5\) is calculated as :

\[CS5=a_{5}+b_{5}\left(\frac{Si-a_{i}}{b_{i}}\right) \tag{7}\]

Figure 3: Scatter plot of \(S5\) to \(S2\) as a function of the injected charge for \(C_{in}=5\)\(pF\) (left ). Profile of the scatter plot fitted with linear functions used to calculate the correction for saturation effects (right).

where \(a_{i}\) and \(b_{i}\) are defined as follow :

\[\overline{Si}=a_{i}+b_{i}Q_{in} \tag{8}\]

for \(i=2,3,4,5\).

For each value of \(Q_{in}\) the mean value \((\overline{S5},\overline{CS5})\) and the width \((\sigma_{S5},\sigma_{CS5})\) of the distributions of \(S5\) and \(CS5\) are calculated with a gaussian fit. Figure 4 shows the \(\overline{CS5}\) (solid line) and \(\overline{S5}\) (dashed line) as a function of \(Q_{in}\). The charge range covered with \(C_{in}=5\;pF\) allows to saturate a maximum of two samples as shown in figure 2. The plot on figure 4 (right) shows the three regions where \(CS5\) is calculated with 0, 1 or 2 saturated samples. The linearity is recovered on the whole charge range, enlarging by about a factor three the dynamic range of the \(high\) amplification.

The dependence of \(\overline{CS5}\) on \(Q_{in}\) is fitted with a linear function on the whole range, linearity is then assessed plotting the ratio between \(\overline{CS5}_{fit}\) and \(\overline{CS5}\) for each value \(Q_{in}\). The linearity is within 1% as shown on figure 5 (left, solid line). On the same figure is shown the linearity for the signal recorded with low amplification. The resolution \(\sigma_{CS5}/\overline{CS5}\) as a function of the injected charge is shown on figure 5, where it is possible to recognize the three zones corresponding to 0, 1 and 2 saturated samples. The resolution obtained when 2 samples are saturated is :

\[\frac{\sigma(\overline{CS5})}{\overline{CS5}}=\frac{4\%}{\sqrt{Q_{in}\left(pC \right)}} \tag{9}\]

The resolution obtained with corrected _high_ gain greatly improves the resolution with respect to the resolution obtained with _low_ amplification, in the charge range \(Q_{\it in}=[12,40]\ pC\). On figure 5 is also plotted the hadron energy resolution [1] :

\[\sigma(E)/E=\frac{45\%}{\sqrt{E(GeV)}} \tag{10}\]

this can be directly compared to the charge resolution since the conversion factor pC to GeV is \(\simeq 1\). The contribution given by the ADC resolution to the overall resolution depends on the number of cells that collect the signal, thus the single ADC resolution represents a maximum contribution limit. However if the _high_ gain signal can be used up to \(\simeq\ 20\ pC\) this contribution is totally negligible with respect to the statistic term (figure 5) on the whole energy range.

It is possible to further increase the dynamic range of the ADC as shown on figure 6 where the signal of \(S3\) and \(S2\) is shown to still depend linearly on \(Q_{\it in}\) up to \(\simeq 100\ pC\).

The dependence of _low_ gain \(Si_{\it low}\) for \(i=5,4,3,2\) are shown on (figure 6). In CIS events the _low_ gain is never saturated. The linear dependence of \(Si_{\it low}\) though shows that the method applied to the _high_ gain to correct for saturation effects can similarly be applied to _low_ gain allowing to record single cell signal up to \(\simeq 5\ TeV\).

The overall loss in linearity for the extended range has to be evaluated considering

the whole readout chain and can be done using data recorded using a laser source, this is presently under study and will be subject of an update of this note.

## 3 Conclusions

A method to correct for saturation effects has been shown to allow an increase of the ADC dynamic range by a factor 3 keeping the linearity within 1%. When applied to _low_ gain signal this allows to extend the ADC dynamic range up to single cell energy deposit \(\simeq 5TeV\). The possibility to extend the region in which signal is readout using _high_ gain allow also an improvement in resolution for \(Q_{in}\simeq 12\ pC-40\ pC\).

An evaluation of the overall loss in linearity for high energy jets will be assessed with laser data. A study to understand how the signal from real particles is reconstructed with this method is being pursued.
