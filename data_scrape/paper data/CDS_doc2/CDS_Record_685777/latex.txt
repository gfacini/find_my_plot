## 1 Introduction

The Cathode Strip Chambers(CSC) had been chosen for use in the Muon System of the GEM Experiment at the SSC. The CSCs are ordinary Multiwire Proportional Chambers(MWPC) with segmented cathodes in which the track is determined by interpolation of the charge induced on the precision cathode strips. The (CSCs provide the triggering, tracking(both precision and transverse coordinates), as well as bunch crossing identification. Thus all functions required in any muon system are performed by a single device. The main features of this technology are:

* Good single layer resolution: 75 microns (45 microns measured in test beams).
* Flexible configuration: axial strips in barrel, radial in endcaps in the case of solenoidal geometries or azimuthal strips in the endcaps for toroidal configurations such as in Atlas.
* Non-bend coordinate measurement provided by the anode wires or by strips in the second cathode.
* Good timing resolution for bunch cross tagging (3.5 ns rms measured).
* Precision elements(cathode strips) directly accessible for alignment.

* Short electron drift time < 30 ns.
* All functions in one technology: triggering, timing, and tracking.
* Insensitive to modest variations of gas composition, drift velocity, atmospheric pressure, and temperature.
* Relative insensitivity to magnetic field (only the spatial resolution degrades gradually, no systematic errors due to the Lorentz effect).

Much of the work for the development of the CSC detector technology for GEM was done with close collaboration between the BNL group and the Petersburg Nuclear Physics Institute which already participates in ATLAS as well as groups from Boston University, SSCLab, Stony Brook, Dubna, and other GEM Institutions. Details on this work can be found in the GEM Technical Design Report.[1]

In this note we outline a possible application of this technology in the very forward Muon System in ATLAS (covering the pseudorapidity interval 2.8 \(>\eta>\approx\) 2.2). This is a particularly demanding region as the background rates approach \(\approx 1kHz/cm^{2}\). In section 2 we summarize some relevant issues on the basic detector R&D and performance, the electronic readout, and the simulation program used for designing and optimizing a muon detector system. In section 3 we outline the proposed layout for the ATLAS forward muon subsystem. We will show that such a subsystem can be built using the Cathode Strip Chamber technology that, in summary. would have the following properties:

* Pseudorapidity interval covered: 2.8 \(>\eta>\approx\) 2.2
* Total detector area: \(\approx\)100 m\({}^{2}\) for the two endcaps, in three measuring stations with six layers in each station(superlayers).
* Spatial resolution of an average of about 75 microns in the bend plane and about 3-5 mm in the non bend plane.
* Correlated charge measurements between the two coordinates to help in resolving ambiguities in cases with more than one hit.
* Fine segmentation in both coordinates: 4-9 mm in the bend plane, 5-20 in the non-bend plane.
* Total number of strips: 117304 in the bend direction. 6258 in the orthogonal direction. Custom electronics development for such a readout is in an advanced state.
* Strips in both coordinates can be used as fine grain fast hodoscopes for triggering if desireable.
* Bunch crossing timing resolution of better than 3.5 nsec rms (for six planes).
* Relative immunity to neutrons.
* Opration at low gain (2-1\(\times\)10\({}^{4}\)) results in an estimated total charge accumulation of 0.2 C/cm of wire for 10 years of LHC operation.

Summary of R&D to date

### Chamber Performance

A vigorous and successful R&D program has been pursued by the muon group of the GEM collaboration in order to demonstrate the required performance of these chambers and develop an engineering design which would allow their cost effective mass production. Several prototype detectors of various sizes were built over the past two years. These prototypes were tested with cosmic rays, radioactive sources, as well as particle beams. Recently one of these prototypes was tested with 300 GeV/c muons in the H2 line at the RD5 Experiment. This four-plane detector was built as a set of two two-gap modules. The two gaps are formed by three flat, rigid panels made of a 23 mm thick sheet of nomex honeycomb and two 1.25 mm thick copper-clad FR4 laminates. The 0.5 oz/ft\({}^{2}\) copper (17 \(\mu\)m thick) forms the cathodes of the two proportional chambers. The panel frames were made of machined Zelux (fiberglass reinforced lexan). They provide the 2.5 mm step for the anode plane of gold-plated tungsten wires 30 \(\mu\)m in diameter with a 2.5mm pitch. The frames of the outer panels have a milled cavity with enough room for the epoxy beads for the wire attachment as well as the anode blocking capacitors. A rubber gasket just outside this cavity provides the gas seal for the assembly. In this manner no components under high voltage are outside the seal thus minimizing the risk of high voltage breakdowns. The sensitive area of this prototype is 45x37 cm\({}^{2}\). The nonflamable gas mixture used was 30%Ar-50%CO\({}_{2}\)-20% CF\({}_{4}\). The position sensing cathode strips with a pitch of 5.08 mm were lithographically etched on either side of the central panel. These cathodes are precisely positioned with respect to each other with the aid of locating pins. The strips are oriented at 90deg with respect to the anode wires providing the precision position measurement in a direction along the wires. The detector was fully instrumented with 256 cathode strip channels. The anode wires were tied together in groups of 20 wires thus forming 5 cm wide elements measuring the transverse coordinate. They were instrumented with TDCs in order to study the timing performance of the detector. The drift velocity for the operating field of 5kV/cm was 80\(\mu\)m/ns, and the Lorentz angle about 8deg.

The prototype was exposed to a 300 GeV/c muon beam at the RD5 Experiment last September. Figure 1 shows a not-so-typical event as the charge collected in the cathode strips of the four layers. An energetic delta ray can be seen along the muon track. The information from three of the four planes was used to define a track and the residual distribution of the fourth plane was used to estimate the spatial resolution. The measured resolutions for all four planes were comparable. One of them is shown in Figure 2. At the top the global resolution from the entire illuminated area of the detector is shown to have an RMS value of 44 \(\mu\)m. At the bottom of Figure 2 the local resolution, as defined by requiring that the muon traverses a given strip, is 28 \(\mu\)m. The quadratic difference of about 30 \(\mu\)m is a measure of the strip to strip rms uncertainty accounting for a variety of effects. The primary factor appears to be remaining channel to channel calibration errors at the level of \(\approx\)0.5%. The resolution as a function of polar and azimuthal angles is shown in Figure 3. The \(\propto\tan\phi\) resolution degradation is due to the well known effect of inclined tracks. whereas the improvement with polar angle is due to the longer track length in the detector and therefore larger deposited charge. Note that in the case of the ATLAS endcaps the detectors are oriented such that these angles are interchanged because of the different orientation of the bend plane.

The logical OR of the four wire planes was fed into a TDC. Thus the earliest time of signal arrival from the four planes with respect to the trigger was recorded. The resulting time distribution is shown in Figure 4. The rms value is 3.6 ns and it can be seen that a 25 ns window includes practically all of the events.

### Cathode Strip Readout

The fine segmentation of the CSCs maintains very low occupancy levels even at the highest luminosity and provides a trigger system with sufficient granularity even for the endcaps. It also results, however, in a system with a relatively large number of readout channels. In addition high resolution(\(\approx\)1%) charge measurement is required for the position determination by interpolation of the induced charge.1 It is essential, therefore, that a high performance, low cost readout system be developed. We addressed this challenge with an aggressive, two-pronged approach:

Footnote 1: The spatial resolution of the CSCs depends linearly on the signal to noise ratio. For a given gas gain the lowest possible electronic noise results in optimum resolution. Note that one can not arbitrarily increase the gas amplification in order to compensate for poor noise performance. It has been shown[2] that for most gases the resolution degrades rapidly for anode charge larger than \(\approx\)1 pC due, primarily, to photon mediated avalanche fluctuations.

We have designed a compact readout system which features a high performance, low noise, hybrid, charge integrating preamplifier followed by a 16-channel monolithic shaping amplifier with multiplexed output. This CMOS integrated circuit (AMPLEX)[3] was designed at CERN for silicon detector applications and hence the need for a different front end. A block diagram of the cathode strip readout and calibration system used with the prototypes is shown in Figure 5. The whole system is implemented with a handful of standard modules and a custom built 10-bitFADC which can handle up to 4096 multiplexed analogue signals. This allowed us to test the prototypes fully instrumented (200-600 channels) in order to study problems relating to large numbers of precision electronics channels. For comparison a 6-layer supermodule in the ATLAS forward endcap configuration would have of order 1000 channels.

In parallel, a custom integrated circuit development effort was initiated. A multichannel monolithic circuit with appropriate amplifiers, tail cancelation curciuity, multiplexer, as well as parallel outputs for triggering is already in an advanced development stage by P. O'Connor of the BNL Instrumentation Division.[4] Prototype chips performing various functions of the system have already been fabricated and in bench tests they performed as designed. The following parameters have been measured in bench tests:

* Noise for \(t_{p}\)=400 nsec: 570 rms electrons + 12.7 e/pF.
* Fast parallel output (shaper+discriminator): <2nsec time walk for a 10:1 input range.
* Shaper nonlinearity <0.2%.
* Track/Hold/Multiplexer nonlinearity <0.3%.
* On-chip calibration circuit matching <1.1%.

Currently an one-channel design with all the required functions, i.e. precision amplifier/shaper with variable gain and peaking time, sample and hold circuit, multiplexer, as well as fast (30 msec) parallel shapers and discriminators for triggering, has been submitted for fabrication. It is expected that by the end of the summer an 8-channel chip will be available to be tested with chambers. A block diagram of this chip is shown in Figure 6.

### Simulations Program

A detailed Monte Carlo simulation program has been written to study the basic chamber performance and to assist us in the chamber design.2 It considers all factors affecting the chamber operation and performance:

Footnote 2: The development of this program was stimulated by discussions with H. Van de Graaf who, at the time, had developed a similar program for the Honeycomb Strip Chambers

* Simulates the primary ionization along the track.
* Simulates the avalanche formation.
* Uses' the proper induced charge distribution on the segmented cathodes.
* Simulates the amplifier response.
* Uses the resulting cathode charge distribution to apply various algorithms for the induced charge center of gravity calculation.

All known factors affecting the spatial resolution are taken into account:

* Electronic noise.
* Track inclination and the Lorentz effect.
* \(\delta\)-electrons.
* Diffusion of the drifting electrons.
* Gain variations in the neighbouring channels.
* Charge difference from the near and far gap (here "near gap" indicates the half cell on the side of the segmented cathode).
* The systematic effect due to the angle between the radial cathode strips and the anode wires (for the GEM endcap configuration).

This simulation program has been validated by experimental results and had been incorporated in the GEANT simulation package for GEM. It proved to be an invaluable tool for designing and optimizing detector configurations and cathode segmentation. The performance curves for the proposed ATLAS application shown in the next section were obtained with this program.

## 3 Application to the ATLAS forward region

### General layout and segmentation

In what follows we outline a possible application of the Cathode Strip Chambers in the ATLAS forward muon spectrometer (\(2.2<|\,\eta\,|<2.8\)). At this point it should be considered as a proof of principle or just a starting point for a complete design. Figure 7 shows the basic layout in the three muon stations(superlayers). Each superlayer consists of 6 gaps providing six precision measurements in the bend plane and six measuremnts in the non-bend plane. The chambers are tilted by about 7\({}^{\circ}\) with respect to the vertical in order to minimize the effect of the inclined tracks on the spatial resolution. The azimuthal chamber segmentation is dictated by the degradation of the spatial resolution as a function of the azimuthal angle \(\phi\). Figure 8 shows the calculated resolution as a function of the angle of incidence in the bend plane (top), and the non-bend plane (bottom). The vertical lines in both plots indicate the angular extend of the supermodule segments in each superlayer. A physical module consists of one or more segments in order to keep the chamber size from being unreasonably small. Figure 9, for example, shows the layout of the first station. In this case three segments constitute a physical module. The six gaps of a given module are formed from a stack of seven Nomex honeycomb panels with copper clad G10 faces. The anode wires have a spacing of 2.5 mm and are parallel to the median R-z plane in each segment. One of the two cathodes is segmented in azimuthal strips providing the precision coordinate, while the other is segmented into radial strips for the orthogonal coordinate. This is shown (not to scale) in Figure 10. The sizes of the the segments in the three stations are given in Table 1. W\({}_{inner}\) is the width at the inner perimeter of each disc and W\({}_{outer}\) the width at the outer. One should note that the two orthogonal cathode strips provide a correlated charge measurement which could be used to resolve ambiguities in cases of more that one hits.

The widths of the azimuthal strips in the three stations are approximately projective in the R-z plane, whereas the widths of the radial strips are projective in the R-\(\phi\) plane. Table 2 gives the dimensions of each strip in the three stations.

### Occupancy levels and readout strategy

One can see from Table 2 that the high segmentation of the cathodes results in very small elements. Even at \(\eta\)=2.8 when the expected rate is about 1kHz/cm\({}^{2}\) the rate per element is of the order of 10kHz. To take advantage of this relatively low rate we are designing a

\begin{tabular}{|l||c||c||c|} \hline \hline  & Station 1 & Station 2 & Station 3 \\ \hline \(\Delta\)R & 0.67 & 1.29 & 1.59 \\ W1 & 0.22 & 0.41 & 0.51 \\ W2 & 0.39 & 0.75 & 0.92 \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 1: **Chamber Segment Sizes[meters]**data driven. multiplexed system whose concept is sketched in Figure 11. A HOLD signal is generated within 300 nsec locally by the detection of a local track segment using the fast (30 nsec) parallel outputs. At the end of the Level 1 latency time the local HOLD is either released or, in the case of a valid trigger. maintained and the data become available for the Level 2 trigger. The price one pays for this simplicity is a local dead time which, for a 2 \(\mu\)sec Level 1 latency. is about 10%. If this is deemed excessive then double buffering could be used to reduce this to acceptable levels. One should note that the occupancy of the trigger path is lower by more than two orders of magnitude. Although triggering is not anticipated in this pseudorapidity region, the very low occupancy levels coupled with the fact that local track segments are available in all three stations in both the bend and non bend planes could make a Level 1 trigger scheme feasible.

### Sensitivity to neutrons

The sensitivity of the CSCs to neutrons and photons has been extensively studied and carefully measured by the PNPI group(among others) using the GNEIS Facility at the Gatchina Synchrocyclotron.[5] Figure 12 shows the single layer sensitivity to photons (top), and to neutrons (bottom) as a function of energy. It can be seen that it is about \(10^{-2}\) for photons and about \(10^{-4}\) for neutrons. They also measured the rate at which a neutron causes two or three adjacent layers to give a coincident signal. These rates were found to be \(10^{-6}\) and \(10^{-7}\) respectively. This results in a negligible rate in the forward endcaps compared to the muon rate. Furthermore one should note that the data driven feature of the proposed read-out scheme which requires a local track segment is immune to isolated hits which are most commonly produced by the background gammas and neutrons.
