## 3 Algorithm

Figure 3 shows the induced charge vs. the distance between the strip center and the avalanche position for selected (see Section 4) single muon events. The measured distribution exhibits small fluctuations of the shape at normal (or nearly normal) particle incidence.

To parametrize the induced charge distribution we used the semi-empirical expression by Gatti et al. [4]. For our case of two adjacent interpolating strips for each readout strip, the collected charge is described by the formula:

\[Q(x)=\sum_{i=1}^{6}f_{i}\frac{K_{1}}{K_{2}\sqrt{K_{3}}}\arctan\sqrt{K_{3}} \tanh\left(K_{2}((x-b_{i})/h)\right)\mid.\]

Here, \(x\) is the distance from the avalanche position to the readout strip center; \(h\) is the anode-cathode gap; \(f_{i}\) are parameters determined by the strip capacitive coupling

(in our CSCs they are measured to be \(f_{8}=-f_{1}=0.304\), \(f_{5}=-f_{2}=0.326\), \(f_{4}=-f_{3}=0.371\)); \(b_{i}\) are coordinates of the strip boundaries, for our strip geometry (Fig. 2a) \(b_{8}=-b_{1}=4.40\) mm, \(b_{5}=-b_{2}=2.54\) mm, \(b_{4}=-b_{3}=0.68\) mm. The values of chamber parameters \(K_{i}\) are determined from the best fit to the induced charge distribution measured with an \({}^{55}\)Fe source \(\mid 1\mid\) (since the X-ray data are free of distortions caused by multi-track contamination). The solid line in Fig. 3 shows the resulting charge distribution.

## 4 Data analysis

To produce a data sample of two-particle clusters, we overlaid two single muon clusters selected from data taken at RD5. The single particle position was determined by the center-of-gravity method, which gave a position resolution of \(\sigma=50\)\(\mu\)m \(|1|\). In any CSC layer, it is probable that the shape of the single muon cluster is distorted by \(\delta\)-ray emission. The position measurements of those clusters are expected to be corrupted. To reduce the fraction of such events, in addition to the simple single particle selection criteria used in \(|1|\) we required that the residuals for selected single clusters were within the 3\(\sigma\) range (150 \(\mu\)m).

Fig. 5 shows the efficiency of two-particle reconstruction vs. distance between them, measured from our overlaid two-particle sample. We believe that the difference between the results from simulation and overlaid data is caused by the remaining contamination of the "single-track" data sample with clusters corrupted by multiple hits. Simulation studies showed that the efficiency is not significantly affected by a \(\sqrt{2}\) noise in crease due to overlaying of events. Fig. 5 shows that CSC's are efficient in reconstructing both particles for tracks separated by more than 2 mm. A CSC double track resolution better than the readout pitch was also demonstrated in NA44 experiment using a similar fitting algorithm \(|6|\).

Fig. 6 shows the position resolution in presence of a second particle. The degradation of the position resolution for close tracks is limited to about 10% of the readout

strip pitch. Although inadequate for precision tracking, such a measurement may still be used for muon pattern recognition. A limited degradation of CSC position resolution for close tracks was also demonstrated in \(|7|\).

We believe that our results on CSC performance for close tracks are better than the estimates reported in \(|8|\) due to the more accurate treatment of the induced charge distribution in our fitting algorithm.
