###### Abstract

Muons of 10-300 GeV crossing the Tile calorimeter loose some fraction of their energy (\(\sim\) 3 GeV in the whole calorimeter). The cells where the energy is deposited depend on the muons direction of incidence. Significative signals (\(\sim\) 350 MeV) were observed in cells where the signal should be null. These extra-signals are of the same order of magnitude as the direct signal produced by muons of 10-300 GeV in a cell. This signal, produced by ionization or Cherenkov light, is produced in the fibre bundle-light guide-PMT region, mostly in the PMT photocathode. The preliminary results of some scans with a radioactive source on a Hamamatsu R5900-8 dynodes phototube show instead no significant effects.

Introduction

When 10-300 GeV muons cross the tile calorimeter, they loose some fraction of their energy (\(\sim 3\) GeV in the whole calorimeter). The cells where the energy is deposited depend on the muons direction of incidence. Significative signals (\(\sim 350\) MeV) were observed in cells where the signal should be null (see fig. 1). These extra-signals are of the same order of magnitude that the direct signal produced by muons of 10-300 GeV in a cell.

The relative position of the photomultipliers reading out the extra signals and the beam direction of incidence lead to the conclusion that these extra-signals are produced in the fibre bundle ring-light guide-PMT region.

## 2 Setup and data selection

A calorimeter prototype consisting of five modules, each one spanning \(2\pi/64\) in azimuth, with a front face of \(100\times 20\) cm\({}^{2}\) and radial depth of 180 cm, corresponding to 8.9 \(\lambda\) at \(\eta=0\) or 80.5 X\({}_{0}\), was constructed. The tile calorimeter uses iron as absorber and scintillator plates, read out by wavelength-shifting fibres, as sampling material. An innovative feature of this design is the orientation of the tiles which are aligned parallel to the \(\eta=0\) plane and staggered in depth.

The calorimeter is radially segmented into four depth samplings (corresponding to 1.5, 2, 2.5, and 3\(\lambda\) at \(\eta=0\)) and five transverse segments, thus providing for a projective geometry in azimuth, but not in polar angle (see fig. 1). Each

module is composed by 20 cells and each one is read out by two photomultipliers: one in the right side and the other in the left side of the tiles.

The fibres of each cell are gathered in a bundle by a piece (fibre bundle ring) that holds them and permits their air-coupling to a light guide (which contain UV absorber) which in turn is air-coupled to a PMT (see fig. 2). The gain of the PMT's was set to deliver \(\simeq 6\) pC/GeV. In the following the conversion of muon response (in pC) to energy (in GeV) was made on the basis of the calibration constant found with electrons (\(\alpha_{e}=5.59\) pC/GeV at \(\theta=10^{o}\)).

In order to study the extra source of light, runs with muons of 150 GeV at \(\theta=45^{o}\), that allowed a detailed scan of PMT's (in x and y directions), were done. Data were taken with and without a yellow filter inserted between the light guide and the PMT, whose characteristics are showed in figure 3. Runs with 150GeV muons at \(\theta=90^{o}\) that allowed a detailed scan in the y and z directions, were also done.

## 3 Results

### \(45^{o}\) testbeam data

The results for runs at \(\theta=45^{o}\) are presented in figure 4. The results presented are due to PMT 121 which read out clear fibres.

When a yellow filter is inserted between the light guide and the photomultiplier, one verifies that one of the lateral peaks disappear completely and the other is strongly suppressed. This allows us to conclude that they are concerned with light produced before the photomultiplier (light guide or fibre bundle). The central part of the plot is not significatively modified by the introduction of the filter.

The width at half height of the plot of the data taken without the yellow filter is approximately equal to the diagonal dimension of the bundle ring. This allows us to conclude that the lateral peaks are due to the light produced by ionization or Cherenkov in the fibre bundle. One observes that the fibres cannot produce light because they are clear fibres with UV absorber.

The width at half height of continuos curve is 17 mm which is approximately equal to the diagonal dimension of the light guide. But this signal can not be produced in the light guide because this contains UV absorber and the signal is not significatively modified when the filter is inserted, so we can conclude that the signal is produced in the photomultiplier.

### \(90^{o}\) data

#### 3.2.1 Testbeam data

The results obtained by runs at \(\theta=90^{o}\) are presented in the figures 5 and 6. These results have been obtained using the PMT 159.

The figure 5 shows a detailed scan in the z direction of the fibre bundle-light guide-PMT region. In the z=0 position, which is the photocathode position, one can see an intense peak (\(\simeq 2\) pC). The location of the peak and its width allows us to conclude that this signal is produced by ionization or Cherenkov light production in the photocathode material.

The first plot in figure 6 shows the signal produced in the light guide (z=-10mm). One notes that the peak's width is about 10mm, which is approximately equal to the width of light guide. The height of the signal is about 0.25 pC, which is much smaller than the height of the signal produced in the photocathode.

The second plot of figure 6 shows the signal produced in the photomultiplier region for \(z=+10\) mm (one notes again that the photocathode position is \(z=0\)). The distance between the two peaks is about 45 mm.

#### 3.2.2 Laboratory data

In order to directly study the irradiation effect on a photomultiplier, we built a simple setup in Pisa ATLAS laboratories (fig. 7).

A movable Sr\({}^{90}\) source can scan longitudinally a photomultiplier. The distance between the source and the photomultiplier was about 5 mm, to fully exploit the source collimation. We used two photomultipliers Philips XP2012, already used in the TILECAL beam prototypes.

The photomultiplier signal has been read out using a precision Kethley 2001 multimeter. The source scanned starting from \(4.0\pm 0.1\) cm before the photocathode position and for \(12.5\pm 0.1\) cm in total.

As expected the electrons emitted by the source produce Cherenkov light in the photomultiplier glass. The Cherenkov light produced in the photocathode

Figure 7: The photomultiplier irradiation setupregion is enhanced by the photomultiplier amplification and the light yield in this region is predominant.

Figure 8 shows a photocurrent behaviour similar to the one obtained analyzing the muon data, confirming the nature of the signal in this particular region.

The quartz window of the general purpose photomultiplier act as a pass band filter for the visible light wavelength window, but this Cherenkov light production cannot be avoided. It is straightforward, using the usual equations, to estimate for a window thickness of 1 mm a yield of about 20 photoelectrons due to this effect. We should mention that this numbers refers to a large interval in wavelength and then it is an overestimation, but it gives the idea of the order of magnitude.

The signal from the Cherenkov light produced in the photomultiplier window is normally used as a trigger signal for response speed measurements of response speed of the fibres [1].

The photomultipliers intend to be used in the final TILECAL realisation are anyway of different type. The final photomultipliers must be very compact in size due to the available space for the fibre readout part [1]. One of the possible choice is the very compact photomultiplier Hamamatsu R5900, a square section phototube derived from the Hamamatsu R5600 type [2]. Preliminary measurements, in the same conditions described above, using a radioactive source, have been carried out using a 8-dynodes version of the Hamamatsu R5900 phototube and the results did not show any enhancement of the signal when the electrons of the source cross the photocathode window. The photocathode of the Hamamatsu photomultiplier differs in size and in thickness with respect to the Philips XP 2012 tube and that leads to a substancial reduction of the Cherenkov light signal produced.

## 4 Conclusions

The main responsibles for extra-signal production are the fibre bundle ring and the photocathode.

One way to minimize the production of light in the fibre bundle would be to produce fibre bundle rings using an opaque material or add up to them an UV absorber.

The Cherenkov light produced by the charged particle crossing the photocathode medium, lead to an enhancement of the signal in the case of the Philips XP 2012 photomultiplier used to instrument the testbeam TILECAL prototypes. Some preliminary scans with a radioactive source show that this effect seems to be negligible for one of the final choice photomultiplier type due to the significantly smaller photocathode size and thickness. Of course a scan using muons, also for this phototube, could be useful to better estimate the effects.
