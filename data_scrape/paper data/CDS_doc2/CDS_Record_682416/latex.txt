**Abstract**

We study the effect of the choice of the structure functions and energy evolution scale parametrization for the \(t\bar{t}\), \(Z^{0}\), \(W\) and \(H\) production in _pp_ collisions at \(\sqrt{s}=14\) TeV. The following leading-log parametrizations are used: CTEQ, GRV, EHLQ and DFLM. We show, that even after calibrating \(p_{T}\) and \(\eta\) spectra to the "best known" value of the total cross-section, the parametrization of the structure functions and/or energy scale can create biases at the level of 20% (sometimes even 50%) for these distributions. In addition, we also study the effect of the QCD/QED initial-state showers on these distributions.

Introduction

In hadron-hadron interactions, cross-sections \(\sigma\) are related to the calculable fundamental parton hard scattering cross-sections by the QCD factorization theorem [1] as a sum of integrals convoluting the latter with universal parton distribution functions. The parton distributions can, in principle, be determined from analysing a set of standard experiments: deep inelastic scattering (DIS), lepton-pair production, high \(p_{T}\) direct photon production, \(W-\) and \(Z^{0}-\) production, high \(p_{T}\) jet- production, heavy flavour production, etc. The global QCD analyses of the available data have been performed in the past decade by several groups [2] and more than 30 sets of structure functions parametrization are now available [3]. However, the older ones do not reproduce the most recent data and therefore are not recommended for the present physics simulations.

Large variations of e.g. \(t\overline{t}\), \(W\), \(Z^{0}\) or \(H\) production cross-sections at LHC energies can be expected from the choices of different sets of structure functions (SF) and energy scale (\(Q^{2}\)) parametrizations. The study of the stability of the total cross-sections at LHC energies as a function of the SF and \(Q^{2}\) variations have been performed for the Aachen Workshop. In the case of \(W\) and \(Z^{0}\) production the uncertainties due to the SF parametrization were found to be \(\sim\pm 35\%\)[4]. The uncertainties of the predictions of the \(t\overline{t}\) total cross-section due to different leading order (LO) and/or next-to-leading order (NLO) parton distributions were found to be about \(\pm 10\%\) and due to the scale ambiguity of about \(\pm 15\%\)[5].

Since that time, new data from the NMC [6] and CCFR [7] experiments, which can be used to determine the structure functions, have appeared and new sets of parametrizations have been released, eg. CTEQ [8], GRV [9], MRS [10]. As we go to LHC energies the cross-sections should be dominated by the sea-quarks contributions (case of \(W\) and \(Z^{0}\)) or gluon contributions (case of \(t\overline{t}\), \(H\)). The accuracy of the new data provides unprecedented sensitivity to the flavour dependence of sea-quark distributions and allows for a much better determination of the small-x dependence (\(x\sim 0.01-0.08\) ) of all parton distributions. But, as pointed out in [8], current data allow a range of different extrapolations to smaller \(x\) beyond \(10^{-2}\), which is in fact a region dominant at LHC. Therefore, there is a large spread in the shape for the different sets leading to different results of the cross-section calculations.

We found it interesting to re-examine, with the new parametrization sets, the stability of the total cross-sections and differential distributions as a function of the SF and \(Q^{2}\) variations. However, here we will limit ourselves only to the leading-log calculations as provided by PYTHIA 5.7 [11]. Our study is therefore far less complete than that done for the Aachen Workshop [4, 5]. The consistency of theoretical calculations requires that for LO calculations one use parton distributions calculated using LO evolution equations together with the LO (1-loop) expression for \(\alpha_{s}(Q^{2})\). The following LO parametrizations of structure functions will be considered1: "new"sets: CTEQ 2L [8], GRV LO [9] and "old" sets: DFLM average LO [12], EHLQ set 1 (version 1986) [13]. The CTEQ 2L parametrization2 and the GRV LO parametrization are based on the most recent data. Another parametrization, based on the most recent data is the MRS [10] parametrization but it provides only the NLO set and therefore is not applicable here, because in this case we would need also appropriate NLO calculations for the hard processes. For backward compatibility we show results from the EHLQ set 1 (version 1986) which was the default version of PYTHIA 5.6 and from the DFLM parametrization which, in the NLO version, have been used in several contributions for the Aachen Workshop.

Footnote 2: Note, that CTEQ 2L is the set used as default by PYTHIA5.7.

We will present the following results: total cross-sections as simulated by PYTHIA 5.7 with multiple interactions switched off. Differential distributions for \(d\sigma/d\ln_{10}x\) where \(x\) denotes the fraction of energy carried by partons picked from protons3, \(d\sigma/p_{T}\) where \(p_{T}\) denotes transverse momentum and \(d\sigma/\eta\) where \(\eta\) denotes pseudorapidity of the final state products. We will also re-calibrate differential distributions to the total cross-section given by the CTEQ 2L parametrization and plot the ratio of the distributions as obtained from different parametrizations after this re-calibration. Finally we will show the effect of initial state QCD/QED showers on the \(p_{T}\) and \(\eta\) spectra.

Footnote 3: The \(d\sigma/d\ln_{10}x\) is a distribution which depends on the convolution of the hard cross-section with the structure functions. In the case of exclusive initial-state shower this convolution involves also information from its activity.

## 2 \(t\bar{t}\) production

\(t\bar{t}\) production is simulated by PYTHIA 5.7 through the lowest order QCD \(2\to 2\) hard-scattering processes: \(gg\to t\bar{t}\) and \(q\bar{q}\to t\bar{t}\). It is dominated by the \(gg\) scattering (\(\sim 90\%\) of the total cross-section) and therefore is mostly sensitive to the gluon structure function parametrization. In the case of the \(t\bar{t}\) process we compare results using two definitions of the energy scale: \(Q^{2}=\dot{s}\) and \(Q^{2}=m_{t}^{2}+\frac{\dot{\alpha}^{2}-m_{t}^{4}}{\dot{s}}\).

We start with results with initial-state QCD/QED shower switched off.

In Table 1a4 we collect the total cross-sections for \(\sqrt{s}=14\) TeV, \(m_{t}=170\) GeV and two definitions of \(Q^{2}\). The variation for the total cross-section is \(\sim 10\%\) between5 two "new" sets of parametrizations: CTEQ and GRV. The results from "old" sets of parametrizations differ by \(20\%-40\%\) from the "new" one and give bigger cross-sections. This process is very sensitive to the definition of the energy scale and variation between \(Q^{2}=m_{t}^{2}+\frac{\dot{\alpha}\dot{t}-m_{t}^{4}}{\dot{s}}\) and \(Q^{2}=\dot{s}\) gives \(\sim 25\%\) difference on the total cross-section for the same SF parametrization. The latter definition of \(Q^{2}\) gives a smaller total cross-section.

Table 1b presents the dependence of the total cross-section on \(m_{t}\). It decreases rapidly as \(m_{t}\) increases. For larger \(m_{t}\) we probe a slightly higher region in \(x\) of the structure functions (\(x_{min}>4m_{t}^{2}/s\)) and, as can be seen from Table 1b, the ratios of total cross-sections using different SF change slightly with the top-quark mass.

The integrated cross-sections above a given threshold value for the top-quark transverse momenta \(p_{T}^{t}\) (with respect to the beam axis) are collected in Table 1c for threshold values: \(p_{T}^{t}>50\) GeV, 100 GeV and 200 GeV.

In Fig. 1 we present the \(d\sigma/d\ln_{10}x\) distribution where \(x\) denotes the fraction of energy carried by the parton picked out from the proton. In the case where initial-state showers are switched off this parton with an unchanged energy fraction enters into the hard-scattering. As can be seen in this Figure the \(t\bar{t}\) production at \(\sqrt{s}=14\) TeV and for \(m_{t}=170\) GeV is sensitive to the parton structure function parametrization down to \(10^{-3}\). The difference between "old" sets and "new" sets are clearly visible. Figs. 2 and 3 present differential distributions for the \(d\sigma/dp_{T}^{t}\) and \(d\sigma/d|\eta^{t}|\) respectively. The \(p_{T}\) spectrum is not very sharp and has its maximum around 100 GeV.

A simple re-calibration of the differential distributions from different sets of the SF parametrizations will not obviously lead to their agreement. We expect the disagreement still to show up, mostly in the tail region of the distributions. The Figs. 2a and 3a present the ratios of the respective distributions after re-calibration to \(\sigma_{tot}(CTEQ)\). For the \(d\sigma/d|\eta^{t}|\) the shapes of the distributions from the CTEQ and GRV agree within \(\sim 5\%\) and from CTEQ and "old" sets differ even by \(\sim 50\%\) (\(d\sigma/d|\eta^{t}|>3\)), with a magnitude comparable for the DFLM and EHLQ parametrizations. In contrast, the shapes of the \(d\sigma/dp_{T}^{t}\) distributions between CTEQ and EHLQ agree (\(\sim 10\%\)) whereas between CTEQ and GRV we observe differences of up to 25% in the plotted region of \(p_{T}^{t}<500\) GeV.

The effect of the definition of the energy scale \(Q^{2}\) on the differential distributions is shown in Figs. 2b and 3b. We present the ratios between the distributions from CTEQ parametrization for two different options: \(Q^{2}=m_{t}^{2}+\frac{\hat{d}-m_{t}^{4}}{\hat{s}}\) and \(Q^{2}=\hat{s}\), after re-calibration to the \(\sigma_{tot}\) of the first option. The effect is smaller for \(p_{T}^{t}\) spectrum (below 10% in plotted region of \(p_{T}^{t}<500\) GeV) and a bit bigger for \(\eta^{t}\) spectrum (up to 25% for \(3<|\eta^{t}|<4\)).

We study also the effect of initial-state QCD/QED showers. In PYTHIA the initial state shower is handled within a backwards evolution scheme [15]. The hard scattering is based on the use of evolved parton distributions, which means that the inclusive effects of initial state radiation are already included (in the structure functions parametrizations). Therefore, without kinematical cuts, the total cross-section remains the same. The construction of exclusive showers is done starting from the two incoming partons at the hard interaction, tracing the shower 'backwards in time', back to the two shower initiators (partons picked from protons). The latter have decreased \(Q^{2}\) and increased momentum fraction \(x\) in comparison with those entering the hard scattering. This is shown in Fig. 4 where the \(d\sigma/d\ln_{10}x\) distributions are presented for \(t\bar{t}\) production with the CTEQ structure function parametrization and initial-state shower switched on and off. The initial state showers shift around (net boost and rotations) the kinematics of the original hard interation and therefore affects the \(p_{T}^{t}\) spectrum. This effect is better visible in Table 1d where the cross-sections above a given threshold value \(p_{T}^{t}\) are compared for CTEQ parametrization and initial-state radiation switched off and on. The \(d\sigma/dp_{T}^{t}\) distributions are compared in Fig. 4a and the observed effect is as big as 50% for \(p_{T}^{t}\sim 500\) GeV. We do not observe changes in the \(d\sigma/d\eta^{t}\) distribution (Fig. 4b). As the parton shower approach tends to underestimate the effect for the large \(p_{T}\) the uncertainty on the \(p_{T}^{t}\) spectrum coming from this source can be possibly on the level of uncertainty from parton structure functions and evolution scale. But, as \(p_{T}^{t}\) spectrum has no threshold behaviour (is not very sharp) around its maximum(\(p_{T}^{t}\sim 100\) GeV) in this region the effect is smaller than 10%.

Let us recall, that final-state QCD/QED showers from the top-quark itself are very rare (only in 2% of \(t\bar{t}\) events the invariant mass of final state is reduced by more than 20% due to this shower) and does not affect significantly the \(p_{T}^{t}\) spectrum (see [14]).

## 3 The \(Z^{0}/\gamma^{*}\) and \(W\) production

\(Z^{0}/\gamma^{*}\) and \(W\) production in _pp_ collisions can be simulated by PYTHIA as a \(2\to 1\) production of a single resonance (\(q_{i}\overline{q}_{i}\to Z^{0}/\gamma^{*}\) and \(q_{i}\overline{q}_{j}\to W\)) and/or \(2\to 2\) processes, where the resonance is recoiling against a jet (\(q_{i}\overline{q}_{i}\to gZ^{0}/\gamma^{*}\), \(q_{i}g\to q_{i}Z^{0}/\gamma^{*}\) and \(q_{i}\overline{q}_{j}\to gW\), \(q_{i}g\to q_{k}W\)). With initial-state showers turned on, the \(2\to 1\) process also generates additional jets. It is recommended [11], to use the \(2\to 1\) processes with initial-state parton showers if the events under study have \(p_{T}<m_{\,Z}/m_{\,W}\). For studies of \(Z^{0}\) and \(W\) production at large transverse momenta it is more proper to use \(2\to 2\) processes as parton showering tends to underestimate the \(p_{T}\)-distributions.

Below, we will discuss the small transverse momenta exclusive \(Z^{0}/\gamma^{*}\to e^{+}e^{-}\), \(W\to e\nu\) channels (\(p_{T}^{*}<m_{\,Z}/m_{\,W}\)), and inclusive \(Z^{0}/\gamma^{*}\), \(W\) production at large transverse momenta (\(p_{T}^{\,Z/W}>50\) GeV).

### The \(pp\to Z^{0}/\gamma^{*}\to e^{+}e^{-}\) process

For this simulation we turn on the hard process \(q\overline{q}\to Z^{0}/\gamma^{*}\) which is followed by the decay \(Z^{0}/\gamma^{*}\to e^{+}e^{-}\). This process is sensitive to the valence/sea quark distributions. We require a hard process energy \(\sqrt{\hat{s}}>40\) GeV, so we collect events mainly from the \(Z^{0}\) peak (otherwise we would have additional large contribution from events with very small \(\hat{s}\) coming from the \(\gamma^{*}\) singularity). We use the energy evolution scale parametrization \(Q^{2}=\hat{s}\).

In Table 2 we collect the total cross-sections for \(\sqrt{s}=14\) TeV.

\begin{tabular}{||l||l||} \hline Struct. function set & \(\sigma_{tot}[nb]\) (\(Q^{2}=\hat{s}\)) \\ \hline \hline CTEQ 2L & 1.582 \(\pm\) 0.005 \\ \hline \hline GRV LO & 1.754 \(\pm\) 0.005 \\ \hline DFLM LO ( average) & 1.231 \(\pm\) 0.005 \\ \hline EHLQ set 1 (version 1986) & 1.065 \(\pm\) 0.004 \\ \hline \end{tabular}

**Table 2 :**_The total cross-section for the pp \(\to Z^{0}/\gamma^{*}\to e^{+}e^{-}\) process. The hard process energy cutoff is \(\sqrt{\hat{s}}>40\)GeV, the proton-proton rest frame energy is \(\sqrt{s}=14\) TeV. Errors are statistical only._

The variation of the total cross-section is \(\sim 10\%\) between the "new" sets of parametrizations: CTEQ and GRV. The results from the "old" sets of parametrizations differ even by \(\sim 50\%\) from the "new" ones and give smaller cross-sections.

We start with the case of initial-state showers turned off. Fig. 5 presents differential distribution \(d\sigma/d\ln_{10}x\) where \(x\) is the fraction of energy carried by the parton picked up from the proton. As we can see this process is sensitive to the valence/sea quarks distribution down to \(x=10^{-4.5}\). The distribution is symmetric with respect to \(x^{2}=M_{Z^{0}}^{2}/s\) and differs significantly in shape for all discussed structure function parametrizations. The electron \(p_{T}^{e}\) spectrum has its maximum at \(M_{Z^{0}}/2\) and sharply decreases for larger \(p_{T}^{e}\). Figs. 6, 7 present the differential distributions \(d\sigma/d\!p_{T}^{e}\) and \(d\sigma/d\!\eta^{e}\).

The simple re-calibration of the differential distributions from the different sets of SF parametrizations does not lead to any good agreement. In Fig. 6a and 7a we present the ratio of these distributions after re-calibration to \(\sigma_{tot}(CTEQ)\). The differences between the shapes are at the level of 20% and "old" sets turn out to be consistent in their predictions after this re-calibration.

We study also the effect of initial-state QCD/QED radiation. As described in the previous chapter the total cross-section (without cuts) remains the same but the differential distributions are shifted due to the kinematical activity of the shower (net boosts and rotations of the hard-process system). Fig. 8 presents the \(d\sigma/d\!\ln_{10}x\) distribution (\(x\) is the fraction of energy carried by the parton picked from the proton) and Fig. 8a the \(d\sigma/d\!p_{T}^{e}\) spectrum with and without initial-state showers. The effect on the \(d\sigma/d\!p_{T}^{e}\) distribution is very significant near the sharp threshold region \(p_{T}^{e}\sim M_{Z^{0}}/2\) where electrons are pushed into the region of \(p_{T}^{e}>M_{Z^{0}}/2\) due to the kinematical activity of the shower. As can be seen from Fig. 8b, the \(d\sigma/d\!\eta^{e}\) distribution remains unchanged.

### The \(pp\to Z^{0}/\gamma^{*}+jet\) process

For this simulation we turn on the hard processes: \(q_{i}\bar{q}_{i}\to gZ^{0}/\gamma^{*}\) and \(q_{i}g\to q_{i}Z^{0}/\gamma^{*}\). The initial-state radiation is turned off. This process is dominated by \(q_{i}g\) scattering (\(\sim 85\%\)) and therefore sensitive to the gluon structure function parametrization as well. We use two definitions of the energy evolution scale: \(Q^{2}=\hat{s}\) and \(Q^{2}=\frac{1}{2}(m_{\perp 1}^{2}+m_{\perp 2}^{2})\) where \(m_{\perp 1}\), \(m_{\perp 2}\) denote the respective transverse masses of the final states in the hard process.

In Tables 3a and 3b we collect the total cross-sections for \(Z^{0}/\gamma^{*}+jet\) production with threshold values for \(p_{T}^{2^{0}/\gamma^{*}}\) of respectively \(50\) GeV, \(100\) GeV and \(200\) GeV. The ratios between the results from different parametrizations slightly change when the threshold value increases. The definition of the evolution energy scale affects the total cross-section by \(10\%\) at most.

In Figs. 9 we present the \(d\sigma/d\ln_{10}x\) distributions for different structure function parametrizations. For the \(p_{T}^{2^{0}/\gamma^{*}}>50\)GeV the region in \(x\) contributing to this process extends down only to \(x_{min}\sim 10^{-3.8}\) and is non-symmetric. In Figs. 9a and 9b we present the ratio of the \(d\sigma/dp_{T}^{2^{0}/\gamma^{*}}\) and \(d\sigma/\eta^{Z^{0}/\gamma^{*}}\) distributions after re-calibration to \(\sigma(CTEQ)\). The differences between the shapes are not bigger than \(\sim 10\%\) except the \(d\sigma/\eta^{Z^{0}/\gamma^{*}}\) distributions for \(|\eta^{Z^{0}/\gamma^{*}}|>3\). The definition of the energy evolution scale, after re-calibration, affects the \(p_{T}\) and \(\eta\) spectra even less (see Fig. 9b and 9d).

### The \(pp\to W\to e\nu\) process

For this simulation we turn on the hard process \(q_{i}\overline{q}_{j}\to W\) which is followed by the decay \(W\to e\nu\). This process is sensitive to the sea quark distributions. We use the energy evolution scale parametrization \(Q^{2}=\hat{s}\).

In Table 4 we collect the total cross-sections for \(\sqrt{s}=14\) TeV.

\begin{tabular}{||l||l||} \hline Struct. function set & \(\sigma_{tot}[n\,b]\) (\(Q^{2}-\hat{s}\)) \\ \hline \hline CTEQ 2L & \(14.96\,\pm\,0.02\) \\ \hline \hline GRV LO & \(16.92\,\pm\,0.05\) \\ \hline DFLM LO ( average) & \(11.24\,\pm\,0.03\) \\ \hline EHLQ set 1 (version 1986) & \(9.978\,\pm\,0.03\) \\ \hline \end{tabular}

**Table 4 :**_The total cross-section for the \(pp\to W\to e\nu\) process. The proton-proton rest frame energy is \(\sqrt{s}=\) 14 TeV. Errors are statistical only._

The variation for the total cross-section is \(\sim 10\%\) between "new" sets of parameters: CTEQ 2L and GRV LO. The results from "old" sets of parametrizations differ even by \(\sim 50\%\) from the "new" ones and give smaller cross-sections.

The distributions \(d\sigma/d\ln_{10}x\), \(d\sigma/dp_{T}^{*}\) and \(d\sigma/d\eta^{*}\) are similar to those presented in the \(Z^{0}/\gamma^{*}\) case (Figs. 5 - 8b).

### The \(pp\to W+jet\) process

For this simulation we turn on the hard processes: \(q_{i}\overline{q}_{j}\to g\,W\) and \(q_{i}g\to q_{k}W\). The initial-state radiation is turned off. This process is dominated by \(q_{i}g\) scattering (\(\sim 85\%\)) and therefore sensitive to the gluon structure function parametrization as well. We use two definitions of the energy evolution scale: \(Q^{2}=\hat{s}\) and \(Q^{2}=\frac{1}{2}(m_{\perp 1}^{2}+m_{\perp 2}^{2})\) where \(m_{\perp 1}\), \(m_{\perp 2}\) denote the respective transverse masses of the final states in the hard process.

In Tables 5a and 5b we collect the total cross-sections for \(W\) production with threshold values for \(p_{T}^{W}\) of respectively 50 GeV, 100 GeV and 200 GeV. The relative ratios between the results from different parametrizations slightly change when the threshold value increases. The definition of the energy evolution scale affects the total cross-section by 10% at most.

The distributions \(d\sigma/d\ln_{10}x\), \(d\sigma/dp_{T}^{W}\) and \(d\sigma/d\eta^{W}\) are very similar to those for the \(Z^{0}/\gamma^{*}\) case (Figs. 9 - 9d).

## 4 The \(pp\to H\to\gamma\gamma\) process

The intermediate mass Higgs production (\(H\to\gamma\gamma\)) in \(pp\) collisions can be simulated by PYTHIA with the following hard processes: \(q\bar{q}\to H\), \(gg\to H\), \(q_{i}q_{j}\to q_{i}q_{j}H\) (\(Z^{0}Z^{0}\) fusion) and \(q_{i}q_{j}\to q_{k}q_{l}H\) (\(W^{+}W^{-}\) fusion) which are followed by the decay \(H\to\gamma\gamma\). The branching ratio \(\Gamma_{H\to\gamma\gamma}\) depends on the \(M_{H}\) (can be as large as \(2\cdot 10^{-3}\)). In this case the \(2\to 1\) and \(2\to 3\) hard processes are switched on.

For \(M_{H}=100\) GeV the total cross-section is dominated by the \(gg\) scattering (\(\sim 70\%\)) with \(W^{+}W^{-}\) fusion contributing at the level of \(\sim 14\%\), \(Z^{0}\,Z^{0}\) fusion at the level of \(7\%\) and \(q\bar{q}\) anihilation \(\sim 5\%\). Table 6 presents the total cross-sections for \(\sqrt{s}=14\) TeV, \(M_{H}=100GeV\) and the energy evolution scale \(Q^{2}=\hat{s}\).

\begin{tabular}{||l||l||} \hline Struct. function set & \(\sigma_{tot}[fb]\) (\(Q^{2}=\hat{s}\)) \\ \hline \hline CTEQ 2L & 34.62 \(\pm\) 0.05 \\ \hline \hline GRV LO & 41.36 \(\pm\) 0.05 \\ \hline DFLM LO ( average) & 42.85 \(\pm\) 0.05 \\ \hline EHLQ set 1 (version 1986) & 41.82 \(\pm\) 0.05 \\ \hline \end{tabular}

**Table 6 :**_The total cross-section for the \(pp\to H\to\gamma\gamma\) process. The mass of the Higgs is \(M_{H}=100GeV\). The proton-proton rest frame energy is \(\sqrt{s}=14\) TeV. Errors are statistical only._

The variation for the total cross-section is \(\sim 20\%\) between the "new" sets of parametrizations: CTEQ and GRV. A very good agreement between results from GRV, EHLQ and DFLM parametrizations is observed. The CTEQ parametrization gives the lowest cross-section for this process.

We now discuss results with initial-state QCD/QED showers switched off. This process is sensitive mainly to the gluon structure function parametrization. Fig. 10 presents the differential distributions \(d\sigma/d\ln_{10}x\) where \(x\) is the fraction of energy carried by the parton picked from the proton. As we can see this process is sensitive to the parton distributions down to \(x=10^{-4}\). Figs. 11 and 12 present the differential distributions \(d\sigma/dp_{T}^{\gamma}\) and \(d\sigma/d\eta^{\gamma}\). As here we have \(2\to 3\) hard processes switched on as well, the \(p_{T}^{\gamma}\) spectrum does not decrease so sharply above the threshold value \(p_{T}^{\gamma}>M_{H}/2\) as discussed previously for the \(p_{T}^{e}\) spectrum in the cases of \(Z^{0}\to e^{+}e^{-}\) or \(W\to e\nu\) production.

If one compares Fig. 1 (dominated by \(gg\to t\bar{t}\) process ) and Fig. 10 (dominated by \(gg\to H\) process ) one can see that the second one is sensitive to the gluonstructure function in regions of smaller \(x\) (down to \(10^{-4}\)) and therefore, that the dependence on the parametrization of the structure functions is different in both cases.

Figs. 11a and 12a present the ratios of the distributions after re-calibration of the total cross-sections to \(\sigma_{tot}(CTEQ)\). In Fig. 11a it is visible that simple re-calibration leads to biases on the \(p_{T}^{\gamma}\) distributions in the tail region ( above \(\sim M_{H}/2\)) at the level of 25% between the GRV, EHLQ, DFLM and CTEQ parametrizations.

We also studied the effect of initial-state QCD/QED radiation. As described in the previous sections the total cross-section (without cuts) remains the same but the differential distributions are shifted due to the kinematical activity of the shower (net boosts and rotations of the hard-process system). Fig. 13 presents the \(d\sigma/d\ln_{10}x\) distribution (\(x\) is the fraction of energy carried by the parton picked from the proton) with and without initial-state radiation. Fig. 13a presents the \(d\sigma/dp_{T}^{\gamma}\) spectrum with and without initial-state showers. The effect on the distribution is very significant near the sharp threshold region \(p_{T}^{\gamma}\sim M_{H}/2\) where photons are pushed into the region of \(p_{T}^{\gamma}>M_{H}/2\) due to the kinematical activity of the shower. As can be seen from Fig. 13b the \(d\sigma/d\eta^{\gamma}\) distribution remains unchanged.

The Higgs mass is \(M_{H}=100\) GeV. The initial-state QCD/QED showers are switched off. The proton-proton rest frame energy is \(\sqrt{s}=\) 14 TeV.

Summary

In this note we have re-examined the stability of the total cross-sections and differential distributions as a function of the structure functions and energy scale parametrizations for a number of physics processes of interest at LHC. We limited ourselves only to the leading-log calculations as provided by PYTHIA 5.7. Therefore, we considered only LO structure function parametrizations: the "new" sets CTEQ 2L and GRV LO and, for backward compatibility, the "old" sets: DFLM (average LO) and EHLQ set 1 (version 1986). We considered the following processes: \(pp\to t\overline{t}\), \(pp\to Z^{0}/\gamma^{*}\to e^{+}e^{-}\), \(pp\to Z^{0}/\gamma^{*}+jet\), \(pp\to W\to e\nu\), \(pp\to W+jet\) and \(pp\to H\to\gamma\gamma\).

Let us summarise here the main conclusions6:

Footnote 6: The numbers in % are given with respect to the CTEQ results which are used as a reference.

* \(t\overline{t}\) production The "new" sets CTEQ and GRV are consistent on the level of 10%. They give smaller total cross-section by \(\sim 30\%\) than the "old" ones. The biases on the differential distributions between "new" sets and "old" sets, after re-calibration, can be even as big as 50%. This process is very sensitive to the definition of the energy scale \(Q^{2}\) which affects both the total cross-sections (\(\sim 25\%\)) and differential distributions ( after re-calibration \(\sim 20\%\)). The initial-state QCD/QED shower modified significantly the \(p_{T}^{t}\) spectrum at large \(p_{T}^{t}\) (\(\sim 50\%\) for \(p_{T}^{t}\sim 500\) GeV), but the effect is smaller than 10% for \(p_{T}^{t}\sim 100\) GeV.
* \(Z^{0}/\gamma^{*}\to e^{+}e^{-}\) channel, \(W\to e\nu\) channel The "new" sets CTEQ and GRV are consistent on the level of 10%. They give bigger total cross-section by \(\sim 30\%\). The biases on the differential distributions between "new" sets and "old" sets, after re-calibration, are \(\sim 20\%\). The initial-state QCD/QED shower modifies significantly shape of the threshold region in \(p_{T}^{e}\) ie. \(p_{T}^{e}\sim M_{Z^{0}}/2\). Due to the shower the sharp threshold shape is smeared ( threshold bin reduced by factor of 2) into region of \(p_{T}^{e}>M_{Z^{0}}/2\).
* \(Z^{0}/\gamma^{*}+jet\) production, \(W+jet\) production The "new" and "old" sets are consistent on the level of 10%. The shape of the \(p_{T}^{t}\) distributions, after re-calibration, depends weakly on the SF and \(Q^{2}\) parametrization (effect of \(\sim 10\%\) at most). The effect on the \(\eta\) spectrum from choice of SF can be as big as 20% for\(|\eta|>3\).
* \(H\to\gamma\gamma\) channel The results form "new" sets CTEQ and GRV are non-consistent. The GRV parametrization agrees \(\sim 4\%\) with "old" sets. The CTEQ gives smaller total cross-section by \(\sim 20\%\). The biases on the differential distributions between CTEQ set and other sets, after re-calibration, are \(\sim 25\%\). We observe that the tail in the \(p_{T}^{\gamma}\) is particularly strongly affected. The initial-state QCD/QED shower modifies significantly the shape of the threshold region \(p_{T}^{\gamma}\sim M_{H}/2\). Due to the shower the sharp threshold shape is smeared (threshold bin reduced by factor 4) into region of \(p_{T}^{\gamma}>M_{H}/2\).

In general we have found that the effect of the changing from "old" sets to "new" sets depends very much on the process under consideration. The method of the re-calibration to the "best known" total cross-section creates systematic biases on the obtained differential distributions which may need to be taken into account in the systematic error of the results. At present this method is probably sufficient, but precision comparable or better than 50% may need reconsideration.

The kinematical effect of initial-state QCD/QED showers are particularly important in the case of resonance-type \(2\to 1\) hard processes where affects significantly shape of the \(p_{T}\) distribution of the decay products in the its threshold region. In the case of hard processes \(2\to 2\) the kinematical effect of the showers is more smooth but can be also on the level of 50%.
