## 1 Introduction

The present note considers the impact of including ATLAS top-quark pair production data in fits to extract parton distribution functions (PDFs), specifically fits which focus on the role of ATLAS data [1]. However, it is not possible to extract accurate PDFs using ATLAS data alone, one needs data at lower scale to provide a long lever arm for the evolution of the partons as predicted by Quantum Chromo-Dynamics (QCD). This is provided by deep-inelastic scattering (DIS) data. In particular, knowledge of the PDFs of the proton, in the kinematic region relevant for the LHC, comes mainly from the precision DIS data from the HERA experiments [2], which cover a broad range of \(Q^{2}\), the absolute four-momentum transfer squared, and of Bjorken \(x\). The PDF set HERAPDF2.0 has been determined using HERA data alone [2] using information from \(e^{\pm}p\) neutral current (NC) and charged current (CC) scattering. The lower-\(Q^{2}\) NC data constrain the low-x sea-quark distributions and through their precisely measured \(Q^{2}\) variations they also constrain the gluon distribution. Furthermore, the difference between the NC \(e^{+}p\) and \(e^{-}p\) cross-sections at high \(Q^{2}\), together with the high-\(Q^{2}\) CC data, constrain the valence distributions.

These HERA data are used as the basic input to which ATLAS data are added to improve our knowledge of proton structure. A recent fit to ATLAS and HERA data used the precision measurements of the inclusive differential \(W\) and \(Z/\gamma^{*}\) boson cross sections, resulting in the PDF set ATLASepWZ16 [3]. This PDF set improves on the HERAPDF2.0 set in various respects. Firstly, the strange content of the sea can be fitted rather than assumed to be a fixed fraction of the light sea, indeed the strange sea was found to be enhanced at low \(x\), \(x\lesssim 0.05\), compared to previous determinations. This result comes mainly from the shape and normalisation of the \(Z\)-boson rapidity distribution. Secondly, the accuracy of the valence quark distributions at \(x<0.1\) is improved. This result comes from the \(W\)-boson decay lepton pseudo-rapidity distributions.

The top-quark pair production data are complementary to the \(W\), \(Z/\gamma^{*}\) boson data in their PDF constraining power since they are expected to be sensitive to the high-\(x\) gluon distribution [4]. Thus, adding ATLAS top-quark pair production data to the HERA data and ATLAS \(W,Z/\gamma^{*}\) boson data should produce a better constrained PDF set. The \(t\bar{t}\) distributions which are most sensitive to the gluon PDF are : the mass of the \(t\bar{t}\) pair, \(m_{tt}\), the rapidity of the \(t\bar{t}\) pair, \(y_{tt}\), the average top-quark rapidity, \(y_{t}\), and the average top-quark transverse momentum, \(p_{T}^{t}\). The impact of these data can be increased if fits can be made to more than one of these distributions simultaneously. For this the full information on systematic and statistical correlations between the data points is necessary. The information on systematic correlations was supplied in the original publication, but the information on statistical correlations is made available for the first time in this note. The impact of the \(t\bar{t}\) data using these statistical correlations is assessed and studies are made varying the treatment of the correlations of the systematic uncertainties between the distributions. It is particularly timely to perform this fit now since the next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) predictions of perturbative QCD for top-quark pair production data have recently become available in a form readily usable in PDF fits [5] and these represent a considerable improvement on the next-to-leading order (NLO) predictions particularly for normalisation of the total \(t\bar{t}\) cross section. The resulting PDF set is called ATLASepWZtop18.

Other recent work on top-pair production data include the ATLAS measurement of the ratios of \(t\bar{t}/Z\) cross sections [6], the ATLAS PDF fit to the lepton variables in dilepton \(t\bar{t}\) production [7], the CMS PDF fit to double differential lepton+jets \(t\bar{t}\) distributions [8], and the study of Czakon et al. [4].

## 2 Input data sets

The fits are performed to four different classes of data samples: \(e^{\pm}p\) DIS data from HERA; inclusive \(W\), \(Z/\gamma^{*}\) boson data from ATLAS; \(t\bar{t}\) production in the lepton+jets channel from ATLAS; \(t\bar{t}\) production in the dilepton channel from ATLAS. The details of these samples are given below.

The combined \(e^{\pm}p\) cross section measurements of H1 and ZEUS [2] cover a kinematic range of \(Q^{2}\) from near 1 GeV\({}^{2}\) to above \(10^{4}\) GeV\({}^{2}\) and of \(x\) from \(\sim 0.6\) down to \(10^{-4}\). Full information on the correlations of systematic uncertainties is provided. There are 169 sources of systematic uncertainty which are correlated between the differential \(x\), \(Q^{2}\) distributions of neutral and charged current reduced cross sections for \(e^{\pm}p\) scattering, as well as correlated bin-to-bin within each distributions.

The ATLAS \(W\), \(Z/\gamma^{*}\) boson data come from the precision measurement using 4.6 fb\({}^{-1}\) of data at 7 TeV [3]. They access a kinematic range prescribed by the boson masses, which extends from 46 to 150 GeV, and the proton beam energy giving an \(x\) range of \(0.001\lesssim x\lesssim 0.1\). The \(W^{+}\) and \(W^{-}\) boson differential cross sections have been measured as functions of the \(W\) boson decay lepton (\(e,\mu\)) pseudorapidity, \(\eta_{\ell}\), with an experimental precision of \(0.6-1.0\%\). The \(Z/\gamma^{*}\) boson rapidity, \(y_{\ell\ell}\), has been measured in three mass ranges: \(46<m_{\ell\ell}<66\) GeV; \(66<m_{\ell\ell}<116\) GeV and \(116<M_{\ell\ell}<150\) GeV and in central and forward rapidity ranges, with an experimental precision of 0.4% for central rapidity and 2.3% for forward rapidity. The absolute normalization of the \(W\), \(Z/\gamma^{*}\) boson cross sections is known to within 1.8 %. Many systematic uncertainties on the measurements of the \(W\) and \(Z/\gamma^{*}\) boson cross sections exhibit correlations bin-to-bin within the distributions as well as between the \(W\) and \(Z/\gamma^{*}\) boson processes and this is taken into account using a detailed list of 131 sources of fully correlated systematic uncertainties. The low mass off-peak \(Z/\gamma^{*}\) boson data is not used in the present analysis because it is now clear that the lower-\(x\) region probed by these data is subject to further QCD [9] corrections which are not readily calculable. This data set had little influence on the ATLASepWZ16 PDFs.

The \(t\bar{t}\) data have been measured at 8 TeV using 20.2fb\({}^{-1}\) of data in the lepton+jets [10] and dilepton [11] decay modes. The data are used at the full phase space parton level, since current NNLO predictions are only available for stable tops. In the lepton+jets channel the differential spectra that are sensitive to the gluon PDF are: the mass of the \(t\bar{t}\) pair, \(m_{tt}\), the rapidity of the \(t\bar{t}\) pair, \(y_{tt}\), the average top-quark rapidity, \(y_{t}\) and the average top-quark transverse momentum, \(p_{T}^{t}\). Each of these spectra has full information on systematic bin-to-bin correlations. There are 55 such sources of systematic uncertainty and these are also correlated between the different spectra. Bin-to-bin statistical correlations within each spectrum and between the spectra are made available in this note and are detailed in Section 4. In the dilepton channel, the spectra for the mass of the \(t\bar{t}\) pair, \(m_{tt}\), and the rapidity of the \(t\bar{t}\) pair, \(y_{tt}\), are used. Note that although the transverse momentum distributions of the \(t\bar{t}\) pair, \(p_{T}^{tt}\), are available for both channels these are not used since the predictions are effectively NLO, rather than NNLO. The \(t\bar{t}\) data are sensitive to the gluon PDF for \(x>0.01\)[4]. For the dilepton data the correlations are provided as a total covariance matrix for each spectrum separately, so that only one of these distributions may be fitted at a time. However, one dilepton spectrum may be fitted together with the lepton+jets spectra, so that an increased constraining power is obtained, as described later. A common normalization of these 8 TeV data, of 2.6%, is applied in this fit.

The \(t\bar{t}\) data are given as both normalised and absolute spectra. The absolute spectra are used in the present study since they carry extra information on the normalisation of the cross-sections, which is not input anywhere else in the fit. At NNLO an accurate prediction can be made for the absolute normalisation of the data, which was not possible at NLO. A cross-check has been made using normalised lepton+jetsspectra, since the role of the systematic correlations is different, and very similar results are found, with somewhat reduced constraining power. The fits to normalised data are presented in the Appendix.

## 3 Theoretical Framework

The present QCD analysis uses the xFitter framework [12; 13; 14]. The DGLAP evolution of the PDFs to NNLO is done using QCDNUM [15]. The light quark coefficient functions are calculated to NNLO also using QCDNUM. The contributions of heavy quarks are calculated in the general-mass variable-flavor-number scheme of Refs. [16; 17]. The renormalisation and factorisation scales for the DIS processes are taken as \(\mu_{r}=\mu_{f}=\sqrt{Q^{2}}\). The program MINUIT [18] is used for the minimisation. Each step is cross-checked with an independent fit program [19].

Predictions for the \(W\) (CC) and \(Z/\gamma^{*}\) (NC) Drell-Yan (DY) boson production are calculated following the prescription of Ref. [3] and a brief description is given below. Calculations are made at fixed order in QCD to NNLO and in electroweak(EW) to NLO. The results are cross-checked between the DYNNLO1.5 [20; 21] and the FEWZ3.1.b2 [22; 23; 24]. The scales for the DY processes are taken to be the decay dilepton invariant mass appropriate to the centre of the mass bin in the NC case and the \(W\) boson mass in the CC case. The xFitter package uses the APPLGRID code [25] interfaced to the MCFM program [26; 27] for fast calculation of the differential \(W\) and \(Z/\gamma^{*}\) boson cross sections at NLO in QCD and LO in EW and a \(K\)-factor technique is used to correct from NLO to NNLO predictions in QCD and from LO to NLO predictions in EW. These \(K\)-factors are close to unity within \(1-2\%\).

The NNLO predictions for top-quark pair production [5] are supplied in the form of FastNLO grids [28; 29] for the data in the lepton+jets channel. The predictions for \(m_{tt}\), \(y_{tt}\) and \(y_{t}\) are given for the renormalisation and factorisation scale equal to \(H_{T}/4\), where \(H_{T}=\sqrt{m_{t}^{2}+(p_{T}^{t})^{2}}+\sqrt{m_{t}^{2}+(p_{T}^{\bar{t}})^{2}}\), and the predictions for \(p_{T}^{t}\) are given for scale equal to \(m_{T}/2\), where \(m_{T}=\sqrt{m_{t}^{2}+p_{T}^{2}}\) and \(m_{t}=173.3\) GeV 1. For the dilepton channel APPLGRID is interfaced to MCFM to produce NLO grids and a \(K\)-factor technique is used to correct from NLO to NNLO predictions, using \(K\)-factors from reference [4]. The NNLO/NLO \(K\)-factors are \(\sim 7\%\) above unity and flat for \(y_{tt}\), and vary between \(6\%\) and \(12\%\) above unity for \(m_{tt}\), as \(m_{tt}\) rises from \(345\) GeV to \(1600\) GeV. Electroweak corrections for the \(t\bar{t}\) spectra are also considered using the additional \(K\)-factors given in reference [30]. For the \(8\) TeV data these corrections can be up to \(1\%\) for \(y_{tt}\) and \(y_{t}\), up to \(2\%\) for \(m_{tt}\), and up to \(4\%\) for \(p_{T}^{t}\).

Footnote 1: This value of the top-quark mass does not match that in the MC event generators used to model the top-quark. This small mismatch does not affect the PDF fits. Variation of the top-quark mass is considered in Sec. 8.

The evolution equations of QCD yield the PDFs at any value of \(Q^{2}\) given that they are parameterised as functions of \(x\) at an initial scale \(Q_{0}^{2}\). In the present analysis, this scale is chosen to be \(Q_{0}^{2}=1.9\) GeV\({}^{2}\) such that it is below the charm mass threshold \(m_{c}^{2}\). The heavy quark masses are chosen to be \(m_{c}=1.43\) GeV and \(m_{b}=4.5\) GeV. The strong coupling constant is fixed to \(\alpha_{S}(M_{Z})=0.118\). A minimum \(Q^{2}\) cut of \(Q_{min}^{2}\geq 10.0\) GeV\({}^{2}\) is imposed on the HERA data. All these assumptions are varied in the evaluation of model uncertainties on the final fit.

The quark distributions at the initial scale are represented by the generic form

\[xq_{i}(x)=A_{i}x^{B_{i}}(1-x)^{C_{i}}P_{i}(x), \tag{1}\]where \(i\) specifies the flavour of the quark distribution and \(P_{i}(x)=(1+D_{i}x+E_{i}x^{2})e^{F_{i}x}\). The parameterised quark distributions, \(xq_{i}\), are chosen to be the valence quark distributions \((xu_{\nu},~{}xd_{\nu})\) and the light antiquark distributions \((x\bar{u},~{}x\bar{d},~{}x\bar{s})\). The gluon distribution is parameterised with the more flexible form \(xg(x)=A_{g}x^{B_{g}}(1-x)^{C_{g}}P_{g}(x)-A_{g}^{\prime}x^{B_{g}}(1-x)^{C_{g}^{ \prime}}\), where \(C_{g}^{\prime}\) is set to 25 to suppress negative contributions at high \(x\). The parameters \(A_{u_{\nu}}\) and \(A_{d_{\nu}}\) are fixed using the quark counting rule and \(A_{g}\) using the momentum sum rule. The normalization and slope parameters, \(A\) and \(B\), of \(\bar{u}\) and \(\bar{d}\) are set equal such that \(x\bar{u}=x\bar{d}\) at \(x\to 0\). The strange PDF \(x\bar{s}\) is parameterised as in Eq. 1, with \(P_{\bar{s}}=1\) and \(B_{\bar{s}}=B_{\bar{d}}\), leaving two free strangeness parameters, \(A_{s}\) and \(C_{s}\). By default it is assumed that \(xs=x\bar{s}\). The \(D,E\) and \(F\) terms in the polynomial expansion \(P_{i}(x)\) are used only if required by the data, following the procedure described in Ref. [13]. This leads to two additional terms, \(P_{u_{\nu}}(x)=1+E_{u_{\nu}}x^{2}\) and \(P_{\bar{u}}=1+D_{\bar{u}}x\). Thus the form of the central parameterisation has one more free parameter (\(D_{\bar{u}}\)) as compared to the ATLASepWZ16 analysis [3] and a total of 16 free parameters.

The setup for the fits considered in this note differs from that of the published ATLASepWZ16 fit in three respects, apart from the addition of top-quark pair production data. Firstly, the low mass off-peak \(Z/\gamma^{*}\) boson data is not used and, as has already been mentioned, this has negligible impact on the fits. Secondly, the minimum \(Q^{2}\) on the HERA data is \(Q^{2}_{min}=10.0\) GeV\({}^{2}\), rather than \(7.5\) GeV\({}^{2}\), this larger cut was already considered as one of the model variations of the ATLASepWZ16 fit and is used as standard now to avoid the region of the HERA data which may be subject to \(\ln(1/x)\)-resummation effects [9] that are not accounted for in the standard formalism. Thirdly the parameter \(D_{\bar{u}}\), is free and non-zero for the standard fit, whereas for the ATLASepWZ16 fit it was considered as a parameterisation variation. This new fit setup was used to fit only the HERA and the ATLAS \(W,Z/\gamma^{*}\) boson data; the resulting PDFs are very similar to the ATLASepWZ16 PDFs and well within their uncertainties. In this note this fit is referred to simply as the 'epWZ' fit and when ATLAS \(t\bar{t}\) data are added the fits are specified as 'epWZ+'. Finally, a new fit incorporating some of the \(t\bar{t}\) spectra as well as the \(W,Z/\gamma^{*}\) boson data and the HERA data is called the ATLASepWZtop18 PDF fit.

The form of the \(\chi^{2}\) used to confront the \(t\bar{t}\) lepton+jets measurements, \(\mu_{i}\), with the predictions, \(m_{i}\), for data points, \(i\), is given in Eqn. 2;

\[\chi^{2}=\sum_{ij}\left(m^{i}-\sum_{k}\gamma_{k}^{i}b_{k}-\mu^{i}\right)C_{\rm stat ~{}\,\,ij}^{-1}\left(m^{j}-\sum_{k}\gamma_{k}^{i}b_{k}-\mu^{i}\right)+\sum_{k} b_{k}^{2} \tag{2}\]

where the statistical correlations between data points \(i\), \(j\) are given by the matrix \(C_{\rm stat~{}\,\,ij}\) but the systematic correlations are treated by the nuisance parameters \(b_{k}\) for each source of systematic uncertainty \(k\). The quantities \(\gamma_{k}^{i}\) represent the one-standard-deviation correlated systematic uncertainty on point \(i\) due to systematic uncertainty source \(k\). The penalty term \(\sum_{k}b_{k}^{2}\) implements the \(\pm 1\sigma\) constraints of the nuisance parameters. For the \(t\bar{t}\) dilepton channel measurements the complete information on systematic and statistical correlated uncertainties is contained in a covariance matrix \(C_{ij}^{-1}\) and the \(b_{k}\) terms are not necessary. The form of the \(\chi^{2}\) for HERA and ATLAS data is given in Ref. [3].

## 4 Determination of Statistical Correlations

The determination of statistical correlations within each spectrum and between different spectra of the lepton+jets \(t\bar{t}\) data are evaluated using the Bootstrap Method [31]. The method is based on the extraction of \(N\) Bootstrap samples from the data sample. Each sample is made by associating a Poissonian weight to each event in data. The spectra from each Bootstrap sample is subject to the same full analysis chain used for the nominal results. Since the weights are generated on an event-by-event basis, the replicated spectra are synchronised, thus allowing the determination of statistical correlations among different spectra. The statistical correlations are evaluated bin-by-bin as in:

\[C^{AB}_{ij}=\frac{\frac{1}{N}\cdot\sum_{k=1}^{N}(\mathcal{R}^{A,k}_{i}-\mu^{A}_ {i})(\mathcal{R}^{B,k}_{j}-\mu^{B}_{j})}{\sigma^{A}_{i}\cdot\sigma^{B}_{j}}\]

where \(C^{AB}_{ij}\) is the element \((i,j)\) of the statistical correlation matrix among spectra \(A\) and \(B\), \(\mu^{A}_{i}\) and \(\sigma^{A}_{i}\) are the mean and the standard deviation between the replicas in the i-th bin of spectrum \(A\), respectively, and \(\mathcal{R}^{A,k}_{i}\) is the content of the i-th bin of the k-th replica for spectrum \(A\). The number of replicas has been set to \(N=10^{5}\).

Tables of the statistical correlations between the spectra are available from Ref. [32].

## 5 Results

All fits include the \(e^{\pm}p\) DIS data from HERA and the inclusive \(W\), \(Z/\gamma^{*}\) boson data from ATLAS. Thus, in the description which follows, only the \(t\bar{t}\) spectra that are included in addition are explicitly specified.

For each class of input data (HERA, ATLAS \(W\), \(Z/\gamma^{*}\) and ATLAS \(t\bar{t}\)) systematic uncertainties are treated as fully correlated both bin-to-bin within each spectrum and between spectra unless otherwise stated. There are no correlations between the HERA data and the ATLAS data. Correlations between ATLAS 7 TeV \(Z/\gamma^{*}\) boson and ATLAS 8 TeV \(t\bar{t}\) data have been considered in Ref. [6] and found to be very small and are thus neglected. Correlations between ATLAS 8 TeV \(t\bar{t}\) data in the lepton+jets channel and the dilepton channel cannot be readily disentangled given that the uncertainties for the dilepton data are given as a total covariance matrix rather than in individual sources. However, correlations between these channels are small since the dilepton channel is not subject to the larger systematic uncertainties due to jet energy scale and b-jet efficiencies. Thus only the luminosity of these data sets is considered as correlated.

The newly available statistical correlations for the lepton+jets \(t\bar{t}\) data, detailed in Sec 4, are used unless otherwise stated.

### Fits to individual \(t\bar{t}\) lepton+jets spectra

The fits to the various \(t\bar{t}\) spectra are first considered one by one, for each of the lepton+jets spectra. The effect of including the new bin-to-bin statistical correlations within each spectrum is small but non negligible. Fig. 1 illustrates the difference in the gluon PDF obtained from making fits to the \(p_{T}^{t}\) spectrum with and without the bin-to-bin statistical correlations.

The total \(\chi^{2}\) per number of degrees of freedom (NDF) for all data in the fit and the partial \(\chi^{2}\) per number of data points (NDP) for the contributing classes of data are given in Table 1 for each the fits to different \(t\bar{t}\) lepton+jets spectra. This separation into classes of data: HERA; ATLAS \(W\), \(Z/\gamma^{*}\) boson; ATLAS \(t\bar{t}\); can only be made because there are no correlations between these data sets.

The partial \(\chi^{2}\) for the HERA data and the ATLAS \(W\), \(Z/\gamma^{*}\) boson data are similar to those obtained in fits to HERA data alone and to HERA+ATLAS \(W\), \(Z/\gamma^{*}\) boson data, respectively, such that there is no tension between these data sets

term. This reduces the \(\chi^{2}/NDP\) for the fit to the absolute \(y_{t}\) spectrum from 18.3/5 to 14/5. Secondly, a term \((1+E_{g}x^{2})exp(P_{g}x)\) is introduced instead. The further reduction of the \(\chi^{2}/NDP\) is insignificant; 14/5 falls to 13.5/5. A similar effect is found for the \(y_{tt}\) spectrum, addition of further parameters does not reduced the \(\chi^{2}/NDP\) lower than 15/5. The shape of the gluon distribution found in these fits remains similar to that obtained with the standard parameterisation and the quality of fit is still poor. Introducing such freedom into the fits for the \(p_{T}^{t}\) and \(m_{tt}\) spectra does not improve the \(\chi^{2}\) or change the shape of the gluon PDF. Thus this extra freedom is not introduced for most of the fits in this note. However, it is considered for the final fits when parameterisation uncertainties are included.

### Simultaneous Fits to more than one \(t\bar{t}\) lepton+jets spectrum

Fitting two spectra simultaneously is now considered. Fig. 4 shows the effect on the gluon distribution of adding \(t\bar{t}\) spectra step by step. These fits use the new information on the statistical correlations between the spectra, as well as the full systematic correlations. In Fig. 4(a) first \(p_{T}^{t}\) is added and then \(y_{t}\) is added. In Fig. 4(b) first \(y_{t}\) is added and then \(p_{T}^{t}\) is added. Clearly using both spectra softens the high-\(x\) gluon obtained from \(p_{T}^{t}\) alone whereas it hardens the high-\(x\) gluon obtained from \(y_{t}\) alone, affecting a compromise which favours \(y_{t}\) in being softer than the epWZ gluon distribution. The effect of using two spectra at once decreases the gluon PDF uncertainty in the region \(0.01<x<0.1\) - but the \(\chi^{2}\) of the fit is not satisfactory, see Table 2. In fact it is marginally higher than the simple addition of the \(\chi^{2}\) for the fits to the two spectra separately. Note that this high \(\chi^{2}\) is not related to the use of statistical correlations between the spectra, the \(\chi^{2}\) values (and indeed the fitted PDFs) are similar with or without these correlations as also shown in Table 2. Furthermore, any fit which uses the \(y_{t}\) or \(y_{tt}\) spectra in combination with other spectra (or with each other) gives similar results, the \(\chi^{2}/NDP\) of the fits is high and cannot be reduced by addition of further parameters and the gluon PDF shape is pulled so as to be softer at high-\(x\).

Figure 4: (a) the gluon spectrum from fitting HERA data and ATLAS \(W,Z/\gamma^{*}\) boson data plus the \(t\bar{t}\) lepton+jets \(p_{T}^{t}\) and \(y_{t}\) data, compared to using \(p_{T}^{t}\) alone. (b) the gluon spectrum from fitting HERA data and ATLAS \(W,Z/\gamma^{*}\) boson data plus the \(t\bar{t}\) lepton+jets \(p_{T}^{t}\) and \(y_{t}\) data, compared to using \(y_{t}\) alone. The ratio plots underneath the main distributions show the fractional uncertainties of the gluon PDFs for the fits. The full lines in these ratio plots show the ratio of the gluon PDF fitted to epWZ + \(p_{T}^{t}+y_{t}\) data to the gluon PDF fitted to the epWZ + \(p_{T}^{t}\) data for a) and the ratio of the gluon PDF fitted to epWZ + \(p_{T}^{t}+y_{t}\) data to the gluon PDF fitted to the epWZ + \(y_{t}\) data for b).

Next simultaneous fits to the \(t\bar{t}\)\(p_{T}^{t}\) and \(m_{tt}\) spectra are considered since these have good \(\chi^{2}\) when fitted separately and their effect on the gluon PDF is compatible, in that both of them tend to harden the gluon. Fig. 5 shows the gluon PDFs for fits to these two spectra compared to fits using each of these spectra separately. Using both spectra hardens the high-\(x\) gluon further compared to the result of using either \(p_{T}^{t}\) or \(m_{tt}\) alone. However, the \(\chi^{2}\) for the fit to these two spectra simultaneously is very poor, \(\sim 3\) times larger than the simple addition of the \(\chi^{2}\) for the fits to the two spectra separately, as can be seen in Table 2. This is very surprising since effect of fitting the two spectra separately is compatible. Once more, this high \(\chi^{2}\) is not related to the use of statistical correlations between the spectra, the \(\chi^{2}\) values (and indeed the fitted PDFs) are similar with or without these correlations as also shown in Table 2.

To summarise, the fit to \(p_{T}^{t}\) and \(y_{t}\) data is poor and the main reason for this is the poor fit to the \(y_{t}\) spectrum and the fact that the \(p_{T}^{t}\) and \(y_{t}\) spectra pull the high-\(x\) gluon distribution in opposite directions, as discussed in Section 5.1. However, the source of the high \(\chi^{2}\) for the fit to \(p_{T}^{t}\) and \(m_{tt}\) data cannot be attributed to a poor fit to either of the spectra separately. The source of this tension seems to lie in the treatment of the correlation of systematic uncertainties between the two spectra. This is explored in the

## 6 The role of correlated systematic uncertainties

The largest systematic uncertainties for the absolute spectra are due to ISR/FSR (\(\sim 8\%\)), the parton shower model (\(\sim 5\%\)) and the hard-scattering model (\(\sim 4\%\)). These are 2-point systematic uncertainties in that they are estimated from the difference between two models. For example, the parton shower model uncertainty is estimated from the difference between Powheg+Herwig and Powheg+Pythia. Whereas it is reasonable that these differences should be correlated between the bins of a single distribution, it is not so clear to what extent they are correlated between the distributions.

In the fitting procedure these systematic uncertainties are treated such that they can introduce correlated shifts in the predictions using nuisance parameters, \(b_{k}\), see Eqn. 2. Examining the nuisance parameters for these three sources of systematic uncertainty, in each of the fits to the individual \(t\bar{t}\) spectra, it can be seen that the \(m_{tt}\) spectrum induces an opposite shift to that of the \(p_{T}^{t}\) spectrum and the \(y_{tt}\) and \(y_{t}\) spectra, see Table 3. When the spectra are fitted together the assumption of full correlation of these sources of systematic uncertainty between the spectra means that the fit must give the same value of the nuisance parameter for each of the spectra fitted. Clearly a reasonable compromise can be made between the values favoured by the \(p_{T}^{t}\) spectra and the \(y_{t}\) spectra. However, the fit to \(p_{T}^{t}\) and \(m_{tt}\) will struggle to determine values of the nuisance parameters which fit both the \(p_{T}^{t}\) and \(m_{tt}\) spectra well, and the resulting \(\chi^{2}\) will be large.

Thus the effect of decorrelating these sources of systematic uncertainty is investigated. Firstly, the nuisance parameters for all three sources are considered to be different for each spectrum such that they are decorrelated between the spectra, while remaining correlated within each spectrum. Secondly, each of the three sources are decorrelated one at a time, so that only one of these sources is taken as different for each spectrum and this is done in three different fits, one for each source of uncertainty. The most significant effect comes from the decorrelation of the parton shower uncertainty. In Table 4 the total and partial \(\chi^{2}\) for the fits to the \(p_{T}^{t}\) and \(m_{tt}\) spectra and the \(p_{T}^{t}\) and \(y_{t}\) spectra are given with all three 2-point sources of systematic uncertainty decorrelated.

The effect of decorrelation is marginal for the fit to \(p_{T}^{t}\) and \(y_{t}\), as is expected from the fact that the nuisance parameters induced by these systematic uncertainties are similar. This is also the case for any fits combining \(y_{t}\) or \(y_{tt}\) with other spectra. However, for the fit to \(p_{T}^{t}\) and \(m_{tt}\) the effect of decorrelation is dramatic bringing the \(\chi^{2}\) down to the level of the added \(\chi^{2}\) of the separate fits. For this fit, Table 4 also records the effect of decorrelating only the parton shower uncertainty. The common nuisance parameter for the parton shower uncertainty for the correlated fit takes the value \(-0.32\pm 0.10\). The separate nuisance parameters for the decorrelated fit take the values \(-0.47\pm 0.15\) for the \(p_{T}^{t}\) spectrum and \(+0.10\pm 0.03\) for the \(m_{tt}\) spectrum. These values may be compared with those in Table 3 for the separate fits. The nuisance parameters for the other sources of systematic which are not

\begin{tabular}{l c c c c} \hline Systematic uncertainty source & \multicolumn{4}{c}{lepton+jets spectrum} \\  & \(p_{T}^{t}\) & \(y_{t}\) & \(y_{tt}\) & \(m_{tt}\) \\ \hline Hard scattering model & +0.74\(\pm\) 0.31 & +0.48\(\pm\) 0.22 & +0.92\(\pm\) 0.37 & -0.43\(\pm\) 0.20 \\ Parton shower model & -1.32\(\pm\) 0.43 & -0.79\(\pm\) 0.26 & -0.51\(\pm\) 0.17 & +0.39\(\pm\)0.13 \\ ISR/FSR model & -0.47\(\pm\) 0.18 & -0.87\(\pm\)0.30 & -1.27\(\pm\) 0.38 & +0.33\(\pm\) 0.10 \\ \hline \end{tabular}

The effect of the \(p_{T}^{t}\) and \(m_{tt}\) data on the gluon PDF for the decorrelated fits is similar to that found when the systematic uncertainties are fully correlated, see Fig. 6. The main effect of decorrelation is the reduction of the \(\chi^{2}\).

## 7 Fits to the \(t\bar{t}\) dilepton spectra

Separate fits to the dilepton spectra have also been made and their \(\chi^{2}\) are reported in Table 5.

The partial \(\chi^{2}\) for HERA data and ATLAS \(W\), \(Z/\gamma^{*}\) boson data are similar to those obtained in fits to HERA data alone and to HERA+ATLAS \(W\), \(Z/\gamma^{*}\) boson data respectively, such that there is no tension between these data sets and the \(t\bar{t}\) dilepton data. The fits to both dilepton spectra are good. The good \(\chi^{2}\) for the dilepton

For the fit to the \(p_{T}^{t}\) and \(m_{tt}\) spectra, the result of decorrelating only the parton shower model uncertainty is also shown.

The ratio plot underneath the main distributions shows the fractional uncertainties of the gluon PDFs for the fits and the full line shows the ratio of the gluon fitted to the epWZ + \(t\bar{t}\) data with the systematic uncertainty due to the parton shower model decorrelated to that without this decorrelation.

rapidity data as compared to the lepton+jets rapidity data does not seem to derive from larger uncertainties. Although the statistical uncertainties of the dilepton data are larger the size of the total uncertainties for the absolute spectra is broadly comparable. This highlights the important role of correlated systematic uncertainties.

Fig. 7 shows the gluon spectra before and after each of these dilepton \(t\bar{t}\) spectra are added to the HERA and ATLAS \(W\), \(Z/\gamma^{*}\) boson data. Just as for the lepton+jets spectra the \(m_{tt}\) data support a somewhat harder gluon and the \(y_{tt}\) data support a somewhat softer gluon, but in the dilepton case the effects are milder and both fits are good.

## 8 Fits to the \(t\bar{t}\) dilepton and lepton+jets spectra

In the present section the \(m_{tt}\) and \(p_{T}^{t}\) spectra from lepton+jets and the \(y_{tt}\) spectrum from the dilepton data are fitted together. This fit is called the ATLASepWZtop18 PDF fit. The parton shower model uncertainty is decorrelated between the two lepton+jets spectra. The two dilepton spectra cannot be fitted simultaneously because no information on the statistical correlations between these spectra is available. The \(y_{tt}\) spectrum is chosen in order to include a rapidity spectrum in the fit. The \(\chi^{2}\) for this fit are given in

Figure 7: (a) the gluon spectrum from fitting HERA data and ATLAS \(W\), \(Z/\gamma^{*}\) boson data plus the \(t\bar{t}\) dilepton \(m_{tt}\). (b) the gluon spectrum from fitting HERA data and ATLAS \(W\), \(Z/\gamma^{*}\) boson data plus the \(t\bar{t}\) dilepton \(y_{tt}\) data. The ratio plots underneath the main distributions show the fractional uncertainties of the gluon PDFs for the fits and the full line shows the ratio of the gluon PDF fitted to epWZ + \(t\bar{t}\)data to the gluon PDF fitted to the epWZ data

\end{table}
Table 5: Total and partial \(\chi^{2}\) for data sets entering the PDF fit for fits to the dilepton \(m_{tt}\) and \(y_{tt}\) spectra Table 6. The partial \(\chi^{2}\) for the HERA and the ATLAS \(W\), \(Z/\gamma^{*}\) boson data are similar to those obtained in fits to HERA data alone and fits to HERA+ATLAS \(W\), \(Z/\gamma^{*}\) boson data respectively, such that there is no tension between these data sets and the top-quark pair production data. The partial \(\chi^{2}/NDP\) for the ATLAS \(t\bar{t}\) data are good for both the lepton+jets \(p_{T}^{t},m_{tt}\) data and the dilepton \(y_{tt}\) data. Fig. 8 shows the gluon spectra before and after these three \(t\bar{t}\) spectra are added to the HERA and ATLAS \(W\), \(Z/\gamma^{*}\) boson data. A harder gluon and a significantly reduced high-\(x\) uncertainty on the gluon PDF results. Fig. 8 also shows a comparison of the gluon PDF for the fit using all three \(t\bar{t}\) spectra with the gluon PDF for the fit using only the two lepton+jets \(t\bar{t}\) spectra. The dilepton \(y_{tt}\) data soften the gluon found from the lepton+jets spectra and contributes to the reduction in uncertainty of the high-\(x\) gluon.

However, so far only the uncertainties on the fit due to the uncertainties on the input experimental data have been considered. There are also uncertainties due to model and parameterisation assumptions made

\begin{tabular}{l l c c} \hline  & & & lepton+jets \(p_{T}^{t}\), \(m_{tt}\) \\  & & & and dilepton \(y_{tt}\) spectra \\ \hline total \(\chi^{2}/\)NDF & & 1253.8 / 1061 \\ Partial \(\chi^{2}/\)NDP & HERA & 1149 / 1016 \\ Partial \(\chi^{2}/\)NDP & ATLAS \(W\), \(Z/\gamma^{*}\) & 78.9 / 55 \\ Partial \(\chi^{2}/\)NDP & ATLAS lepton+jets \(p_{T}^{t}\), \(m_{tt}\) & 16.0 / 15 \\ Partial \(\chi^{2}/\)NDP & ATLAS dilepton \(y_{tt}\) & 5.4 / 5 \\ \hline \end{tabular}

The ratio plots underneath the main distributions show the fractional uncertainties of the gluon PDFs for the fits. The full lines in these ratio plots show the ratio of the gluon PDF fitted to epWZ + \(y_{tt}\) dilepton data + \(p_{T}^{t}\) + \(m_{tt}\) lepton+jets data to the gluon PDF fitted to the epWZ data for a) and the ratio of the gluon PDF fitted to epWZ + \(y_{tt}\) dilepton data + \(p_{T}^{t}\) + \(m_{tt}\) lepton+jets data to the gluon PDF fitted to the epWZ + \(p_{T}^{t}\) + \(m_{tt}\) lepton+jets data for b).

in the fit formalism. The model uncertainty includes effects due to variations of the charm (\(1.37<m_{c}<1.49\) GeV) and beauty (\(4.25<m_{b}<4.75\) GeV) quark masses, of the minimum \(Q^{2}\) cut value on the HERA data (\(7.5<Q^{2}_{min}<12.5\) GeV\({}^{2}\)) and the value of the starting scale (\(1.6<Q^{2}_{0}<2.2\) GeV\({}^{2}\)). The variation of the heavy quark masses follows the HERAPDF2.0 analysis [2] and is restricted by experimental data on heavy quark production in deep-inelastic scattering. The variations of \(m_{c}\) and \(Q^{2}_{0}\) also follow the HERAPDF2.0 analysis, note that they are coupled since the requirement \(Q^{2}_{0}<m^{2}_{c}\) must be met. The parameterisation uncertainty corresponds to the envelope of the results obtained with extra parameters \(D_{i}\), \(E_{i}\), \(F_{i}\) added in the functions \(P_{i}\), in Eq. 1. This can result in somewhat different parton distributions with similar \(\chi^{2}\) as for the nominal fit. The parameterisation variation from relaxing the assumption \(B_{\bar{s}}=B_{\bar{d}}\) is also considered. Significant parameterisation variations are the addition of the \(D_{g}\) term to the gluon, as already considered in Section 5.2, and freeing \(B_{\bar{s}}\). The addition of both \(E_{g}\) and \(F_{g}\) terms to the gluon does not bring any additional gluon shape modification. Fig. 9 shows the gluon and valence distributions with model and parameterisation uncertainties and Fig. 10 focuses on the uncertainties for the gluon and sea distributions.

An additional model uncertainty comes from the assumed value of the top-quark mass, \(m_{t}=173.3\) GeV, this is varied by \(+1.7/-1.0\) GeV, following reference [33]2. Changing the top-quark mass has very little

The ratio plots underneath the main distributions show the fractional uncertainties of the PDFs due to various sources. The full line in these ratio plots shows the ratio of the gluon PDF fitted to HERA data and ATLAS \(W\), \(Z/\gamma^{*}\) boson data to the gluon PDF extracted from the new ATLASepWZtop18 fit to the HERA data, ATLAS \(W\), \(Z/\gamma^{*}\) boson data plus the \(t\bar{t}\) dilepton \(y_{tt}\) data and the \(t\bar{t}\) lepton+jets \(m_{tt}\) and \(p_{T}^{t}\) data. Note this ratio is taken the other way up in comparison to the previous plots since the ATLASepWZtop18 fit is now considered as the main fit.

effect on the shape of the extracted PDFs, but the \(\chi^{2}\) of the fit is sensitive to it (preferring the default value). The \(t\bar{t}\) data are also sensitive to the value of \(\alpha_{s}(M_{Z})\), and this affects the shape of the gluon PDF, so this is allowed to vary by \(\pm 0.002\)[34]. This is not considered as an additional model uncertainty, instead of this separate PDF sets at the \(\alpha_{s}(M_{Z})\) values \(0.116,0.118,0.120\) are supplied. A two-dimensional consideration of the variation of \(m_{t}\) and \(\alpha_{s}(M_{Z})\) is beyond the scope of the current note. Similarly scale variations are not considered, the scale choices for the \(t\bar{t}\) distributions are taken from reference [35].

Fig. 11 shows the lepton+jets \(p_{T}^{t}\) and \(m_{tt}\) data and Fig. 12 shows the lepton+jets \(y_{t}\) and \(y_{tt}\) data, compared to the predictions of the ATLASepWZtop18 fit. Note that the latter two rapidity spectra are not included in the fit. Fig. 13 shows the dilepton \(y_{tt}\) and \(m_{tt}\) spectra compared to the predictions of the ATLASepWZtop18 fit. Note that the latter \(m_{tt}\) spectrum is not included in the fit. The predictions are shown both before (full-line) and after (dashed-line) the shifts which account for the correlated systematic uncertainties of the lepton+jets data are applied. The description of the lepton+jets \(y_{tt}\) spectrum shows a different trend than that of the corresponding dilepton spectrum. However, when compared to the uncertainty band for which all systematic uncertainties are added in quadrature the lepton+jets rapidity spectra are visually well described. This again highlights the important role of correlated systematic uncertainties.

## 9 Conclusions

An NNLO pQCD analysis is performed of the differential ATLAS \(W\), \(Z/\gamma^{*}\) boson cross sections at 7 TeV, the \(t\bar{t}\) distributions \(p_{T}^{t}\), \(m_{tt}\) in the lepton+jets channel and \(y_{tt}\) in the dilepton channel at 8 TeV, together with the HERA \(e^{\pm}p\) data, to produce a new PDF set ATLASepWZtop18. The fits use the information on statistical correlations within and between the \(t\bar{t}\) spectra in the lepton+jets channel and the full information

on correlation of systematic uncertainties is used for all data sets which enter the fit. This enables QCD fits for PDFs to be made to these distributions simultaneously.

The choice of the \(p_{T}^{t}\), \(m_{tt}\) spectra in the lepton+jets channel is motivated by the good fits to these data when they are fitted separately. A good fit is maintained when these spectra are fitted together provided the parton shower uncertainty is decorrelated. This decorrelation has no significant impact on the shape of the gluon distribution obtained in the fits, A good fit cannot be obtained to the rapidity spectra in the lepton +jets channel, even when the gluon parameterisation is extended and/or by any choice of decorrelation of systematic uncertainties between spectra. However a good fit is obtained to the \(y_{tt}\) spectrum in the dilepton channel. This difference in behaviour of the two channels is not yet understood.

Including the ATLAS \(t\bar{t}\)\(p_{T}^{t}\), \(m_{tt}\) distributions in the lepton+jets channel and the \(y_{tt}\) in the dilepton channel in a PDF fit together with the HERA data and the ATLAS \(W,Z/\gamma^{*}\) boson data results in a gluon PDF which is marginally harder than that obtained when including only HERA and ATLAS \(W,Z/\gamma^{*}\) boson data (epWZ), with a reduced high-x gluon uncertainty.

The PDFs from the current study will be released to LHAPDFv6 as the ATLASepWZtop18 PDFs. The statistical correlations between the \(t\bar{t}\) spectra in the lepton+jets channel are now given in the HEPDATA entry for these data.
