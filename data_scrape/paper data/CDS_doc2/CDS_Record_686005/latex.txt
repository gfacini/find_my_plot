ABSTRACT

We have irradiated an n-side silicon microstrip detector with 55MeV protons up to an equivalent fluence of 1*1015 p/cm\({}^{2}\) high energy protons. We determine the median pulse height to be 0.7fC at 180V bias and deduce a depletion region of about 80um.

INTRODUCTION

Plans for a pixel detector in ATLAS at the LHC[1] anticipate a total fluence of about 1015 p/cm\({}^{2}\). This is about a factor 10 higher than for the silicon strip detectors. The advantage of pixels is the potentially low noise and thus the possibility to achieve satisfactory signal/noise levels with under depleted detectors. The depletion voltage of a 300um thick detector after those fluences is projected to be in excess of 1000V at an operating temperature of -50C. We have irradiated an n-on-n strip detector with initial depletion voltage of 70V through inversion up to an equivalent high energy fluence of 1015 p/cm\({}^{2}\) and have measured the median pulse height with a 106Ruthenium source at bias voltages varying from 90 to 250V.

DETECTOR and BEAM

The detector was a double-sided, AC-coupled, silicon strip detector with 50um pitch and narrow implant, fabricated by Hamamatsu Photonics and used in the 1995 KEK beam test [2]. The thickness was 300um and the depletion voltage was 70V before irradiation. We connected 128 strips on the n-side to the channels of a low-power, fast amplifier comparator chip LBIC [3] followed by a digital pipeline CDP64 [4], and providing the bias to the p-side. The readout was done via a local level shifter board located about 10cm from the detector and 20m cable through the VME based readout sequencer DRS at 40MHz into a Mac PC.

The beam of 55MeV protons was produced by the 88"Cyclotron at LBNL. At 55MeV, we expect about twice the displacement damage of high energy pions or protons [5]. Thus we will later double the fluences to convert to damage due to high energy protons, which we will call "MIP"s". The beam was collimated with a carbon block to a diameter of 1cm and had an intensity of about 1014 p/cm\({}^{2}\)/hr of 55MeV protons. After predetermined fluences were reached (2.5*101\({}^{12}\), 1*101\({}^{13}\), 5*101\({}^{13}\), 2.5*101\({}^{14}\), 5*101\({}^{14}\) p/cm\({}^{2}\)), the beam shut off automatically and, after a waiting period of about 20min to 1hr to allow the latent activity to die down, the response of the detector at the irradiated spot was measured with a 106Ruthenium source and scintillator telescope, with a beam spot of minimum ionizing particles of 3mm [6]. To shield the non-rad hard part of the front end electronics, we covered both faces of the detector with lead sheets of 1/2" thickness, leaving only 1cm x 1cm beam holes.

The program of measuring the response after each irradiation step was followed until the step at 2.5*1014p/cm2, after which the increased activation of the lead shield released such a large flux of gamma's that a charged particle trigger from the source was swamped with gamma ray hits. At that point, we performed threshold scans during irradiation, using a random trigger. The intensity was so high that we could expect about 6 particles in each strip in each 25ns time slice, allowing for a large signal. We are still analyzing if these threshold scans during irradiation are a useful tool to measure the response. At least we were able to monitor the proper working of the DAQ chain on-line. The response of the detector to the final fluence of 5*1014p/cm2 equivalent to 1*1015MIP's/cm2 was measured in the laboratory after the detector had been stored for about two weeks at -200C to loose enough activity to be transported. The geometrical arrangements were very different for the on-line and laboratory measurements, which resulted in different geometric corrections.

## Temperature Control

The detector was biased to about 100V during the irradiation, with current monitoring to prevent thermal run-away. In addition, the detector was kept at a constant temperature of 47+3oC with the help of heater tapes. The reason for the strict temperature control is that the observed depletion voltage is a function of both the applied fluence and the operating temperature during irradiation and annealing. For intense irradiation as performed here, the initial depletion voltage right after beam shut-off is up to a factor 4 higher than at the minimum, which is reached after a short-term annealing time \(\tau_{\text{S}}\). With increasing time, the depletion voltage increases again, the so-called anti-annealing, with a characteristic long-term anti-anneal time \(\tau_{\text{I}}\). The lowest depletion is reached at a time long with respect to \(\tau_{\text{S}}\) and short with respect to \(\tau_{\text{I}}\). Thus, during irradiation with constant flux F, the depletion voltage \(\mathrm{V_{D}}\) is given approximately by [7]:

\(\mathrm{V_{D}}=\) vz*F*t+vs*F*ts*[1-exp(-t/\(\tau_{\text{S}}\))]+va*F*[t+rl*[-1+exp(-t/\(\tau_{\text{I}}\))]]\)

and after an instantaneous fluence \(\phi\), and elapsed time dt, the depletion voltage is:

\(\mathrm{V_{D}}\) (dt)= \(\phi*\){vz+vs*exp(-dt/\(\tau_{\text{S}}\))+va*[1-exp(-dt/\(\tau_{\text{I}}\))]]

To first order, the constants v are independent of fluence and temperature and have been measured to be:

\(\mathrm{constant\ minimum:}\) \(\mathrm{vz}\)=1.06*10-12 V-cm-2

\(\mathrm{short-term:}\) \(\mathrm{vs}\)=3*10-12 V-cm-2 [8]

\(\mathrm{long-term:}\) \(\mathrm{va}\)=3.8*10-12V-cm-2.

As pointed out before, the lowest depletion voltage is reached when: \(\tau_{\text{S}}<<\) t \(<<\)\(\tau_{\text{I}}\). Both anneal times are independent of fluence and are a function of the operating temperature alone:

\(\tau_{\text{S}}\)= 70*exp(-0.175T) days

\(\tau_{\text{I}}\)= 9140*exp(-0.152T) days, \(\mathrm{T}\) in \(\mathrm{{}^{O}C}\).

Table 1 shows the anneal times as a function of temperature. It should be noted, that for the LHC, where the duration of irradiation is several years, we plan to operate at -100C. Here, where the times are of the order hours, an elevated temperature gives the minimum depletion. From Table 1, we found an optimal operating temperature of +45oC. Because we have ensured that the initial

damage is annealed out, the uncertainty in the exact size of this part which anneals out on the short time scale is irrelevant.

Fig 1 shows the depletion voltage vs. time assuming a constant flux of 10\({}^{14}\)p/cm\({}^{2}\)/hr and one hour measuring times without beam. In this scenario, for an operating temperature of 45\({}^{\text{0}}\)C and a fluence of 10\({}^{15}\)/cm\({}^{2}\) of high energy protons ("MIP's"), we can expect a depletion voltage of about 1400V for the 300 \(\upmu\)m thick detector. This is about a factor 10 higher than that for the ATLAS silicon strips in 10years of LHC operation.

RESULTS

The pulse height is extracted from threshold scans, where the counting rate as a function of threshold setting is determined. They are shown in Fig.2 for the different fluence points. The pulse height spectrum is the derivative of this integral spectrum, and the median is simply the threshold point where the counting rate reaches 50%. One has to understand possible geometrical inefficiencies and trigger biases to determine the 50% point. For example, during on-line measurements, the distances between detector and source and defining scintillator were very large and the source particles were not contained; as mentioned above, the photon rate in the scintillator increased during the run due to activation. The geometrical efficiency was thus about 50%. (see Fig.2). During the final laboratory measurement, the geometric efficiency was close to 100%.

To prove that the detector was still working after 10\({}^{15}\)p/cm\({}^{2}\), we show in Fig.3 the channel maps of the \({}^{106}\)Ru tests at a constant threshold of 1.4fC for different bias voltages: the source profile is clearly seen in the first 50 channels, and otherwise there is little noise, up to a bias of 220V.

At the highest fluence, 10\({}^{15}\)p/cm\({}^{2}\) of high energy protons, the pulse height is 0.7fC and the noise becomes an issue. The detector showed leakage currents of a few mA, all concentrated in a small area of about 50 strips. Thus strip currents of 10-100\(\mu\)A were encountered- given the high operating temperature-, with corresponding noise of 1000's of e-. The counting rate has been corrected for the noise with the help of source-off scans. Fig. 4 shows the median pulse height as a function of fluence for the runs where the "on-line" threshold scans were possible and for the final fluence.

The pre-rad value is shown at \(10^{11}\) MIP/cm\({}^{2}\).

Fig.5 shows the relative pulse height for the 300\(\upmu\)m thick detector as a function of fluence, normalized to the pre-rad value, at a bias voltage of 180V. After a fluence of \(10^{15}\) MIP/cm\({}^{2}\), the pulse height is about 20% of its initial value. For comparison, we also show the pulse height data from Ref.9, where we have averaged the values for the peak and mean for comparison with our median data. Given that the data were taken at different bias voltages and temperatures, the data agree well.

(shown at \(10^{11}\)), as a function of fluence, taken at 180V bias. In addition,

the average of peak and mean pulse height of Ref.9 are shown.

For collider application, the dependence of the pulse height on both the fluence and bias voltage is of interest. In the absence of charge loss due to trapping[10], the pulse height is directly proportional to the depleted region, and thus depends on the ratio of bias voltage to depletion voltage. With the bias voltage V\({}_{\textrm{B}}\) limited to about 200V, and the depletion voltage reaching about 2000V, the detector will be under-depleted and thus the pulse height will be less than the initial 3.4fC.

The depletion voltage is proportional to the square of thickness of the depleted region, and thus the pulse height PH has two different dependences on the depletion voltage V\({}_{\textrm{D}}\) :

PH \(\approx\) const for V\({}_{\textrm{D}}\)\(<\)V\({}_{\textrm{B}}\),

PH = 3.4*(V\({}_{\textrm{B}}\)/V\({}_{\textrm{D}}\))\({}^{0.5}\) fC  for V\({}_{\textrm{D}}\)\(>\)V\({}_{\textrm{B}}\).

At a depletion voltage of about 2000V, one predicts a pulse height PH of about 1fC, when biased with 180V. Trapping would reduce this value to about 0.7C, the number we are observing. In order to check the consistency of the data, we plot in Fig.6 the pulse height vs 1/sqrt(fluence): as we see, the pulse height is essentially constant up to a fluence of 10\({}^{14}\), and should reach zero at infinite fluence. A straight line between the origin and the point at 10\({}^{14}\) passes close to the point at the highest fluence. We find that the observed pulse height agrees with the our expectations.

BIAS VOLTAGE DEPENDENCE

We find that at the ultimate fluence the median pulse height is only weakly dependent on the bias voltage: between 180 and 220V the median increases by about 10%, which is consistent with both a depletion voltage close to 2000V and a square root dependence of the pulse height on the bias voltage, as explained above. Taking into account trapping, the 0.7fC median corresponds to a depletion thickness of about 80um at 180V bias. Assuming, as the data indicate, that the depletion voltage is close to 2000V at a fluence of 10\({}^{15}\)MIP/cm\({}^{2}\), we can determine the pulse height for different bias voltages. Fig.7 shows the pulse height for the fluence of 10\({}^{15}\)MIP/cm\({}^{2}\) as a function of the bias voltage. The fact that the pulse height varies only slowly with the bias voltage in the realistic range below 500V is one of the characteristics of n-on-n detectors which allows their use in the cases where the depletion voltages are very high.

CONCLUSIONS

We have tested the response of an n-on-on silicon strip detector after irradiations to fluences up to equivalent 10\({}^{15}\)p/cm\({}^{2}\) of high energy protons. Using a \({}^{106}\)Ru telescope, we find a median pulse height of about 0.7fC at a bias of 180V, in reasonable agreement with expectations based on the measured fluence and temperature dependence of the depletion voltage.
