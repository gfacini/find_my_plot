# Assembly of Monitored Drift Tubes

MDT group at NIKHEF

7 April 1995

###### Abstract

We describe the assembly of Monitored Drift Tubes into multilayers: i.e. mono-, duo- and quadrolayers. We realize a stacking precision, with respect to effective multilayer design parameters, of about 16 \(\mu\)m r.m.s. in \(Z\) and 16 \(\mu\)m r.m.s. in \(Y\). These r.m.s. values are in reasonable agreement with the quadratic sum of the unavoidable variations in the respective tube centers (10 \(\mu\)m typically) due to the deviation from roundness of the individual tubes and the precision on the relative positioning of complete mono- or duo-layers (about 10 \(\mu\)m).

We also discuss our 'final' jig design which uses commercially available vacuum suction pads to position each individual tube in the jig.

## 1 Introduction

The ATLAS muon spectrometer requires precision stacking of aluminium (drift) tubes into multilayers. Typical multilayer layouts and their important design parameters, are shown in figure 1; the lenght of the tubes varies from 1.4 m for 'Monitored Drift Tube' (MDT) chambers in the innermost layer (small BI) to 5.7 m in the outer most layer (large BO).

Figure 1: Examples of tube multilayers (‘tube units’) as building blocks for the MDT chambers for the ATLAS muon spectrometer.

In this note we describe stacking results for \(4\times 8\) multilayers with tube lenghts between 130 mm and 300 mm. These multilayers only require two jigs: one on either tube end. The multilayer precision is derived from many (8) precision measurements along the inner diameter of each individual tube in the stack (on both ends) as shown in figure 2. The results are compared to the expected precision for the stacking of non-perfect, i.e. elliptical instead of circular, tubes.

In the near future we expect to produce multilayers with longer, 2.5 m and 5.7 m, tubes. This requires in addition to the jigs at both ends many intermediate jigs. This way we expect to maintain the achieved precision; the confirmation requires special measurement tools, e.g. X-ray tomography, not available at the NIKHEF institute.

## 2 Single Tube Characteristics

In our opininion, the important parameters of the individual tubes as far as precision stacking of tubes is concerned, are (the definitions of these parameters are illustrated in figure 3):

* _Outer & Inner Tube Diameter:_ Our jigging method positions the outer circumference of each individual tube. Subsequently we calculate the tube center position from measurements along the tube inner circumference. Eventually the wire will also be positioned by means of a wire locator w.r.t. the tube inner circumference. Outer- and inner tube diameters for an a-select sample of tubes with a 0.500 mm wall thickness are shown in figure 4a-b. For these tubes as well as for the 0.250 mm wall thickness tubes the results agree with the specifications of the company. The r.m.s. on the outer and inner diameters of about 8 \(\mu\)m has no serious effect on the location of the tube center.
* _Deviation from Roundness:_ We define the deviation from roundness as the difference of the largest and the smallest measured radius along the circumference of a tube as shown in figure 3. Typical results on the deviation from roundness are shown in figure 4d for tubes after they were cut to length at NIKHEF. The typical deviation from roundness is in the 20 \(\mu\)m to 30 \(\mu\)m range. This parameter limits the accuracy on the tube center position as shown in section 2.1 below.
* _Straightness:_ This parameters defines the variations of the tube center position along its lenght. To date we ignore this (important) parameter since we only constructed multilayers with short tubes and two jigs: one on either tube end. In the future, mainly this parameter will determine the distance between subsequent jigs. Based on the design value of 30 \(\mu\)m / 300 mm we anticipate an inter jig separation of about 500 mm i.e. we would need 13 jigs for the stacking of the 5.7 m long tubes for the BO MDT chambers.

### Deviation from Roundness and Tube Center Position

The effect of the deviation from roundness on the tube center position can be dealt with easily (analytically) if we assume that it deforms a circular tube into an elliptical tube1 The influence of the deviation from roundness depends not only on the deviation itself, but also on the shape of the wedge used to position the tube. For a particular wedge and a particular value for the deviation from roundness, figure 5 illustrates how the tube center positions wanders around in space depending on the orientation of the tube i.e. the ellips in the wedge.

Footnote 1: A deviation from roundness \(\epsilon\) for a circular tube of diameter \(D\) corresponds approximately to an elliptical tube with large and small axes of \(D+\epsilon\) and \(D-\epsilon\), respectively.

The tube center position has a harmonic dependence on the orientation angle of the ellips. The r.m.s. on the tube center position (taken over the orientation angle) is of course proportional to the deviation from roundness of the tube. The wedge geometry dependence is shown in figure 6. In this figure we show for tubes with a 40 \(\mu\)m deviation from roundness the corresponding r.m.s. on \(Z\) and \(Y\) as a function of the wedge angle: 180\({}^{o}\) means a flat table i.e. no wedge at all ('perfect' in \(Y\) and lousy in \(Z\)) and 0\({}^{o}\) means a vertical wedge ('perfect' in \(Z\) and lousy in \(Y\)). From this figure we decided that the optimal wedge angle is about 75\({}^{o}\), since this results in a not too large r.m.s. on the most important \(Z\) tube center location and at the same time a very small r.m.s. for the \(Y\) tube center location.

In figure 7a the measured tube centers in \(Z\) and \(Y\) are shown as a function of the orientation of the ellips for a particular tube with a large (150 \(\mu\)m) deviation from roundness

positioned in two different wedges. The corresponding r.m.s values of the measurements, 92 (25) \(\mu\)m in Z (Y) for the 120\({}^{o}\) wedge and 68 (31) \(\mu\)m in Z (Y) for the 75\({}^{o}\) wedge, agree quit well with the expected values, 90 (30) \(\mu\)m for the 120\({}^{o}\) wedge and 64 (22) \(\mu\)m for the 75\({}^{o}\) wedge. In figure 7b measurements on various tubes with typical deviations from roundness positioned in a 120\({}^{o}\) wedge are displayed together with the expected distributions (straight lines).

## 3 Multi Tube Assembly Philosophy

Over the past months we used several jigs for the assembly of tubes. In essence we pursued two scenario's to go from 32 single tubes to a quadrolayer of \(4\times 8\) tubes (the maximum we can measure in our measurement device). For both scenario's we try to minimize interference between adjacent tubes i.e. ideally we position adjacent tubes at a distance large enough to avoid tube interference even if the tubes are non-perfect i.e. have a sizeable deviation of roundness, non-straightness or a diameter larger than the nominal 30.000 mm diameter. This means that we do not want to stack tubes directly on top of each other: we position each tube individually in space.

The two scenario's we considered:

Figure 5: Variation of tube center position as a function of the orientation of the ellips w.r.t. the wedge.

Obviously the latter scenario benefits from a large reduction of the number of times one has to glue, perhaps at the expence of a slight increase of the r.m.s. values on the tube center locations. These two scenario's should be compared to the approach adopted by the Seattle group which directly stacks tubes on top of each other. This only requires a single gluing step, but only the tubes in the outer layers are positioned individually by the jigs.

Figure 6: The r.m.s. on the tube center position n \(Z\) and \(Y\) as a function of the angle of the wedge. The deviation from roundness of the tube used in the calculation is 40 \(\mu\)m. The definition of the wedge angle is shown in figure 5.

### Horizontal Spacing between Adjacent Tubes: '\(Z\)'

To position tubes horizontally without interference, we use a periodic jig as shown in figure 8a. The distance between subsequent wedge centers must be larger than the nominal tube diameter. The exact distance depends on the deviation from roundness of the tubes to be used. We used inter-wedge distance between 30.040 mm and 30.100 mm. At present we consider 30.075 mm the ideal inter-wedge distance.

### Vertical Spacing between Adjacent Tubes: '\(Y\)'

To position tubes vertically without interference as well as to define the relative horizontal shift between two successive layers, we use a set of spacers as shown in figure 8b. The height of these spacers defines the vertical spacing between tubes. These sets of'simple' (but very precise!) spacers allow easy realisation of different stacking scenario's in the vertical, \(Y\), direction.

To avoid the stacking of tubes on top of each other we need a mechanism to keep the

Top part for a \(120^{\circ}\) wedge angle and bottom part for a \(75^{\circ}\) wedge angle. Deviation from roundness of the used tube: \(150~{}\mu\)m. (b) The datapoints show the measured r.m.s. on the tube center positions in \(Z\) and \(Y\) as a function of the deviation from roundness of the tube. The lines indicate the expected r.m.s. for a wedge with an angle of \(120^{\circ}\).

tubes of successive layers separated (this applies to the 'two monolayers \(\rightarrow\) one duolayer' step as well as to the 'two duolayers \(\rightarrow\) one quadrolayer' step). We see two possibilities:

1. Use rubber (neoprene) spacers to keep tubes separated i.e. this rubber pushes the tubes apart vertically and therefore the top layer is pressed against the top jig and the bottom layer against the bottom jig. This is illustrated in figure 10.
2. Use vacuum to pull the bottom monolayer (duolayer) down and the top monolayer (duolayer) up.

To date we extensively used many rubber (neoprene) spacers. We only just started the vacuum option. The vacuum option has a clear advantage over the rubber spacer option:

Figure 8: _Our future jig. The ‘large’ top and bottom structures position individual tubes free of interference in the horizontal, \(Z\), direction. The inter-wedge distance defines the gap between tubes in the horizontal, \(Z\), direction. The ‘small’ sets of spacers position tubes in the vertical, \(Y\), direction. The two sets of spacers correspond to a duolayer and a quadrolayer, respectively. The detailed geometry of the spacers defines the gap between tubes in the vertical, \(Y\), direction._

with vacuum both'scenario # 1' (7 gluing steps) and'scenario # 2' (3 gluing steps) are feasible; with rubber only the time intensive'scenario # 1' (7 gluing steps) is possible.

#### 3.2.1 Vacuum

We tried various 'home-made' vacuum suction pads for the positioning of individual tubes. The results were very disappointing due in part to the stiffness of 0.500 mm wall thickness tubes and the tight relation between the size of the gap and the thickness of the O-ring. Therefore we abandoned the 'home-made' solutions in favour of commercially available vacuum suction pads. A very promissing example is shown in figure 9. The force of this pad exerted on the tube is almost independent of the under-pressure, but set by the layout of the pad.

At present we are testing these vacuum suction pads on the already existing jigs. First results with this vacuum suction pad indicate tube positioning variations below 10 \(\mu\)m and tube deformations of the order of 10 \(\mu\)m. We consider these tests very promising and

Figure 9: _Tube assembly jigs equipped with vacuum nipples to position the tubes in the template and keep them separated in the vertical, \(Y\), direction. The bottom part of this figure shows a vacuum suction pad in operation on the left without vacuum applied and on the right with vacuum applied._

we intend to convert one of our existing jigs in order to use these pads to position each tube individually on the jig.

If successful, the vacuum suction pads allow us to skip the mono-layer step i.e. we will directly build duo-layers and subsequently quadro-layers from sets of duo-layers. Of course the vacuum suction pads also eliminate the need to use rubber spacers for the relative positioning of tubes in the vertical, \(Y\), position.

### Multilayer Design Parameters

The important design parameters of a multilayer (mono-, duo- or quadrolayer) are illustrated for a quadrolayer in figure 10. They are:

\(Z_{pitch}\): Distance between subsequent tubes within a monolayer.

\(Z_{offset}\): Shift between first tubes in subsequent monolayers (\(Z_{offset}=\frac{1}{2}\times Z_{pitch}\)).

Figure 10: The relevant design parameters of a quadrolayer.

\(Y_{pitch}\)**:**: Distance between subsequent monolayers.

All the results outline in this report stem from jigs with:

\[Z_{pitch}=30.100\ \mathrm{mm}\quad\Rightarrow\quad Z_{offset}=15.050\ \mathrm{mm}\]

For \(Y_{pitch}\), on the contrary, we investigated several options ranging from almost the closed packed minimum value of \(Y_{pitch}=25.953\ \mathrm{mm}\) to our ideal 'free of interference' value of \(Y_{pitch}=26.067\ \mathrm{mm}\) (see figure 10). These different values of \(Y_{pitch}\) are easy to realize since only the little spacers need to be changed; the jigs, which determine \(Z_{pitch}\), remain unchanged.

NOTE: The \(Y_{pitch}=25.953\ \mathrm{mm}\) value violates our starting point of stacking tubes without interference between neighbouring tubes. We investigated this option to reduce the number of gluing steps i.e. scenario # 2 for the stacking if tubes. In the absence of a proven vacuum technique (section 3.2.1) to position tubes we can only realize this scenario by stacking the tubes directly on top of one another. Note that we still position each individual tube in \(Z\) since we first make two duo-layers and subsequently one quadro-layer.

### Measurement Procedure and Measurement Precision

To determine the quality of an assembled multilayer (mono-, duo- and quadro-layer alike), we calculate the centre \((Z_{C},Y_{C})\), the deviation from roundness (\(\epsilon\)) and the diameter (\(D\)) of each individual tube from eight points measured along its inner circumference. This is shown in figure 2. The set of tube centers, \(Z_{C}^{i},Y_{C}^{i}\) for \(i=1-\#\) of tubes, is used to determine the parameters of the multi-layer: \(Z_{pitch}\), \(Z_{offset}\) and \(Y_{pitch}\). In addition the mean square deviations of the individual tube positions with respect to their design positions is used to calculate the stacking precision: the r.m.s. in \(Z\) and the r.m.s. in \(Y\). The fitting procedure uses the MINUIT program and allows in addition to the parameters \(Z_{pitch}\), \(Z_{offset}\) and \(Y_{pitch}\) also for an irrelevant central position (two parameters) and rotation angle (one parameter) of the measured multilayer.

The precision of the determination of the tube centers is about \(2\ \mu\mathrm{m}\) in both the \(Z\) and the \(Y\) directions, as determined from repeated measurements on a single tube. We also determined the reproducibility of the positioning of a single tube at a fixed orientation in a single wedge. This also gave \(2\ \mu\mathrm{m}\) in both the \(Z\) and the \(Y\) directions. We conclude that the intrinsic precision of the measuring machine and the positioning of individual tubes lead to negligible contributions to the results quoted below.

## 4 Monte Carlo Simulation of Tube Stacking

To assess the ultimate precision for various stacking scenario's, we performed a simple Monte Carlo simulation of the stacking of tubes. In this simulation we deal with tubeswith the following characteristics:

* Tube Diameter: for each tube we take an outer diameter (\(D\)) from an uniform distribution on the interval \(D\in[29.990,30.010>\) mm.
* Tube Deviation from Roundness: for each tube we take a deviation of roundness (\(\epsilon\)) from an uniform distribution on the interval: \(\epsilon\in[10,40>\ \mu\)m.
* Tube Orientation: the orientation (i.e. axes of the ellips) of each tube in the wedge is taken uniform on \([0,2\pi>\).

The Monte Carlo simulation stacks tubes either in separate mono-layers or immediately into duo-layers or even immediately into quadro-layers. If necessary, the subsequent stacking of mono-layers and/or duo-layers is performed by either putting the sub-layers on top of each other (without rubber/vacuum) or by positioning one sub-layer against the top jig and one sub-layer against the bottom jig (with rubber/vacuum). Finally we determine the effective design parameters (\(Z_{pitch},Z_{offset}\) and \(Y_{pitch}\)) of the resultant quadro-layer as well as the important r.m.s. on \(Z\) and \(Y\) positions of the tube centers w.r.t. the effective design parameters. The results are shown in table 1 below; 'Via Mono-Layers' implies controlled spacing in the \(Y\) direction either by means of rubbers or vacuum (i.e. scenario # 1 above), 'Via Duo-Layers' means either with (vacuum) or without controlled spacing in the \(Y\) direction (i.e. scenario # 2 above) and 'Quadro-Layer' means direkt stacking of 32 tubes on top of each other into a \(4\times 8\) quadro-layer. 'Perfect Tubes' are the results obtained if one would use instead of the tubes as described above, perfect circular tubes i.e. tubes with \(D=30.000\) mm and \(\epsilon=0\ \mu\)m. This entry illustrates the quality of the simulation.

From these results we conclude that there is not much difference in the expected precision for the controlled stacking via'scenario # 1' (via mono-layers, 7 gluing steps) and the controlled stacking via'scenario # 2' (via duo-layers, 3 gluing steps). Directly stacking tubes on top of each other for duo-layer assembly worsens the precison, in both the \(Y\) and the \(Z\) directions. The direct stacking of a quadro-layer worsens the precision in both the \(Z\) and the \(Y\) directions even more.

All these results should be taken as indicative, as they depend critically on the assumed input quality of the tubes i.e. the assumption on the tube's deviation from roundness \(\epsilon\) and the variations on the tube diameter \(D\). Jig imperfections have been ignored, the stacking of the ellipses is approximate and the tube quality assumptions are realistic but not perfect. The final accuracy must be determined from prototype assembly tests.

## 5 Prototype Results

### Jig and Spacer Accuracy

To date we produced five jigs (three different designs). The mechanical precision of most of these jigs has been checked using measurement machines at NIKHEF and CERN. These measurements show a mechanical precision of better than 5 \(\mu\)m in Z and Y for the centres of the positioning wedges. Independently we also used instead of real tubes massive aluminium precision rods with a deviation from roundness of only a few \(\mu\)m to verify the intrinsic accuracy of the jigs and the glueing procedure. For our first jigging set, the results are shown in table 2. Because of the lack of stiffness of a single monolayer in the \(Y\) direction, we list two \(Y\) r.m.s. values, when available. The discrepancy between the design \(Z_{pitch}=30.040\) mm and the \(Z_{pitch}\) of the glued monolayers is most likely due to inevitable glue crimp or even due to temperature fluctuations (expect: \(\pm 0.7\)\(\mu\)m per \({}^{o}C\)). The nominal glue gap for these tests was about 140 \(\mu\)m since the rods had an 29.950 mm diameter instead of the 30.000 mm diameters of real tubes. In the future we

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{c|c||c|c|c||c|c||c} Stacking Scenario & \(Y^{0}_{pitch}\) & \(Y_{pitch}\) & \(Z_{pitch}\) & \(Z_{offset}\) & r.m.s. \(Z\) & r.m.s. \(Y\) & \# \(\Delta>\ 20\)\(\mu\)m \\ \hline \hline Via Mono-Layers & & & & & & & \\ (Vakuum or Rubbers) & 26.067 & 26.067 & 30.100 & 15.050 & 11 \(\mu\)m & 6 \(\mu\)m & 0\% \\ (7 gluings) & & & & & & & \\ \hline Via Duo-Layers & & & & & & & \\ (Vakuum) & 26.067 & 26.067 & 30.100 & 15.050 & 11 \(\mu\)m & 6 \(\mu\)m & 0\% \\ (3 gluings) & & & & & & & \\ \hline Via Duo-Layers & 25.960 & 25.951 & 30.100 & 15.050 & 20 \(\mu\)m & 9 \(\mu\)m & 12\% \\ (3 gluings) & 25.980 & 25.955 & 30.100 & 15.050 & 21 \(\mu\)m & 12 \(\mu\)m & 1\% \\ \hline Quadro-Layer & 25.960 & 25.952 & 30.100 & 15.050 & 29 \(\mu\)m & 15 \(\mu\)m & 15\% \\ (1 gluing) & 25.980 & 25.950 & 30.100 & 15.050 & 34 \(\mu\)m & 19 \(\mu\)m & 2\% \\ \hline \hline Perfect Tubes & any & any & 30.100 & 15.050 & \(2-5\)\(\mu\)m & \(2-5\)\(\mu\)m & \\ \end{tabular}

should account for glue crimp by using _effective design parameters_.

We also checked the various spacers under the measuring machine. As expected also these spacers have an absolute mechanical accuracy of better than \(5\ \mu\)m.

We conclude that the required mechanical components would allow stacking of tubes to a precision far better than the \(15-20\ \mu\)m aimed for. We also should realize that temperature can not be ignored, even if we manufacture the relevant mechanical components from Aluminium.

### Multilayer Accuracy

In the following sections we only present the results for multilayers produced by stacking monolayers as described in section 3. In addition to these results we also have earlier results from multilayers produced by stacking monolayers in a slightly different way (as presented e.g. at the Frascati meeting). In this case the relative position of the monolayers, while glueing a multilayer, was controlled by precisely machined surfaces ( horizontal and vertical ) incorporated in the top and bottom templates of the jigs, which were pressed directly against each other, instead of using separate spacers positioned in the tube wedges, as shown in figure 8. We found that it took much more care to obtain reproducable results with this method. Moreover we could not easily try out different stacking scenario's, since this required precise machining of new jigs.

#### 5.2.1 Mono-layers

We used the bottom templates of the 16 wedge jigs to simultaneously glue two monolayers of 8 tubes (tube lenght was 130 mm). On one side of the (short) tubes we used a templates

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{c||c|c|c} Item & \(Z_{pitch}\) & r.m.s. \(Z\) & r.m.s. \(Y\) \\ \hline Nominal & 30.040 mm & - & - \\ \hline Bottom Jig & 30.040 mm & 1.2 \(\mu\)m & 5.2 \(\mu\)m \\ Top Jig & 30.040 mm & 1.2 \(\mu\)m & 3.9 \(\mu\)m \\ \hline Monolayer \# 1A & 30.038 mm & 3 \(\mu\)m & \(-\) (11) \(\mu\)m \\ Monolayer \# 1B & 30.037 mm & 3 \(\mu\)m & \(-\) (14) \(\mu\)m \\ Monolayer \# 2A & 30.036 mm & 3 \(\mu\)m & 6 (11) \(\mu\)m \\ Monolayer \# 2B & 30.035 mm & 3 \(\mu\)m & 5 (13) \(\mu\)m \\ \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 2: Measurements of jigs and monolayers made with precision rods. For the r.m.s Y values we distinguish between measurements of monolayers still held in the jig and outside the jig (numbers in brackets). The r.m.s. Z values are found to be the same for these two cases.

with a 120\({}^{o}\) wedge-angle and on the other side of the tubes we used a template with a \(75^{o}\) wedge-angle. This to verify the predicted dependence of the stacking precision on the wedge angle of the template. A metal bar covered with a thin layer of foam rubber pressed the tubes down in their position in the template, while the glue cured (overnight, Araldite 103). After a few trials the weight of this bar was reduced to limit the deformation of the tubes, which causes a reduction of the tube pitch after the monolayer is taken out of the jig. (This effect is only significant as long as we use tubes without plugs or wire-locators). Using a weight of 20 grams/tube we expect an induced deviation from roundness of less than 3 \(\mu\)m for 0.500 mm thick tubes.

The results of the monolayers measurements are shown in figure 11a-c. On average the pitch of the monolayers is reduced by about 4 \(\mu\)m with respect to the template pitch of 30.100 mm. We attribute this effect mainly to glue shrinkage in the 100 \(\mu\)m gap between the tubes2. Part of the spread in the measured monolayer pitch (\(\pm 3\)\(\mu\)m r.m.s.) may well be due to temperature effects; for Aluminium the thermal expansion coefficient of 22 \(\mu\)m/\({}^{o}C\) introduces a change in \(Z_{pitch}\) of 0.7 \(\mu\)m/\({}^{o}C\).

Footnote 2: We do not know how to convert the specified glue shrinkage to an expected \(Z_{pitch}\) reduction, because of the unknown width of the glue between adjacent tubes: 100 \(\mu\)m minimum to about 1\(-\)2 mm maximum!

The average monolayer \(Z\) resolution of 12 \(\mu\)m is very good and close to the value of 10 \(\mu\) m we expect from the average deviation from roundness (20 \(\mu\)m) of the tubes used. As can be seen in figure 11c the template with the smaller wedge-angle yields a better \(Z\) resolution for a given deviation from roundness, as expected.

The average monolayer \(Y\) resolution obtained from the measurements is 18 \(\mu\)m. This is much larger than value expected (8 \(\mu\)m) from roundness deviations and diameter variations, but since a single monolayer is not very rigid in this direction, the influence of the support during measurement is too large be ignored. We will discuss the \(Y\) resolution in more detail in the section 5.2.3 on quadro-layer measurements.

#### 5.2.2 Duo-layers

Four duo-layers were assembled from monolayers using the brass spacers in between the top and bottom templates to control the horizontal shift and the vertical distance between the layers, as described in sections 3.1 and 3.2 and as shown in figure 8. On one side the vertical distance corresponded to a 100 \(\mu\)m free space between two (ideal) tubes in different monolayers. To maintain this 100 \(\mu\)m gap between tubes in successive monolayers we used short rubber pieces. On the other side the nominal free space was only 20 \(\mu\)m to allow duolayer assembly without the need to use rubber spacers3 Inevitably this small nominal gap of 20 \(\mu\)m between adjacent tubes in successive monolayers will lead to tube interference and thus probably to slightly worse stacking accuracies (see table 1).

Footnote 3: As mentioned already: we expect to use vacuum suction in the future to allow vertical stacking of tubes without interference of adjacent tubes in the vertical, \(Y\), direction.

After measuring the tube-centers the relative position of the two layers was fitted and the results are compared to the expected values in table 3. As can be seen the results are Figure 11: Monolayer results: (a) fitted value of \(Z_{pitch}\), (b) stacking precision (r.m.s.) in \(Z\) direction and (c) \(Z_{r.m.s}\) versus the average deviation from roundness for each monolayer. The circles are for a \(120^{\circ}\) wedge angle and the plusses are for a \(75^{\circ}\) wedge angle.

quite good, with actually a slightly better performance on the No-Rubber side. Repeating the fits with the relative layer positions fixed to the expected values one gets average r.m.s. values for the tube centres of 16 \(\mu\)m in \(Z\) and 14 \(\mu\)m in \(Y\) on the rubber-side, and 11 \(\mu\)m in \(Z\) and 13 \(\mu\)m in \(Y\) on the No-rubber-side

In addition two duo-layers were assembled directly from single tubes with template spacers corresponding to 20 \(\mu\)m free space on one side and only 10 \(\mu\)m on the other, and no rubber between successive tube layers. The measured tube centres were fit with fixed expected values for the relative layer positions, yielding r.m.s. deviations of 14 \(\mu\)m in \(Z\) and 18 \(\mu\)m in \(Y\).

#### 5.2.3 Quadro-layers

The six duo-layers described in the previous section, were assembled into three quadro-layers using the same procedure as for the duo-layers. For two quadro-layers we again used rubber spacers on one side to keep the tubes in layers # 2 and # 3 100 \(\mu\)m away from each other, while on the other side the layers were allowed to touch each other with

a nominal free space of 20 \(\mu\)m. For the third quadro-layer no rubbers were used on either side. The results of the fits to the measurements, using a fixed pitch of \(Z_{pitch}=30.094\) mm (smaller than the design value of \(Z_{pitch}=30.100\) mm to allow e.g. for glue shrinkage) and fixed relative layer positions equal to the expected values (\(Z_{offset}=Z_{pitch}/2=15.047\) mm and \(Y_{offset}=26.067\) mm for the rubber spacer side and \(Y_{offset}=25.961\) mm for the side with no rubber spacers) are listed in table 4.

From these results we conclude that we obtained an average resolution for the tube centres of 16 \(\mu\)m both in \(Z\) and \(Y\). The results for the mono-layer stacking procedure are somewhat better than those obtained with direct tube stacking in duo-layers (Quad III). The measurements and the deviations from the expected tube centre positions for the best (Quad IIB) and worst (Quad IIIB) results are shown graphically in figure 12.

For Quad I and Quad II we also fitted the four monolayers within each quadro-layer separately to distinguish between the contribution to the resolution from positioning individual tubes and the contribution from positioning layers with respect to each other. The average monolayer \(Z\) resolution in these quadro-layers is about 11 \(\mu\)

expected from roundness deviation effects (see section 5.2.1). Since for these quadro-layers the overall \(Z\)-resolution is about 14 \(\mu\)m, we conclude that the contribution from layer positioning is about 9 \(\mu\)m in \(Z\).

The average monolayer \(Y\) resolution in the quadro-layers is also 11 \(\mu\)m, while the value expected from roundness deviatons and diameter variations is at most 8 \(\mu\)m, indicating that there are additional contributions. The overall \(Y\)-resolution for these quadro-layers is 15 \(\mu\)m, and thus the contribution from layer positioning is 10 \(\mu\)m.

## 6 'Final' Jig Design

The design drawings of our 'final' jigs are shown in figure 13. Production of six sets of these jigs will start around 10-4-95 and we expect to finish production by 1-5-95. We slightly reduced the pitch in the \(Z\) as well as in the \(Y\) directions (30.075 mm instead of 30.100 mm) to reduce the free envelop between tubes in particular at positions away from the jigs (non-straightness effects). We also slightly modified the spacer layout, both the duo-layer spacer and the quadro-layer spacer.

We hope to equip these jigs with the vacuum suction pads as shown in figure 9 and as discussed in section 3.2.1.

In may-95 we intend to use six of these 'final' jigs to manufacture a set of 2500 mm long tube units each with \(16\times 4\) tubes. These tube units will be used for a mechanical study of a fairly complete, i.e. with (RASNIK) alignment components, BI prototype MDT chamber. Subsequently we hope to use these same jigs for the realization of \(16\times 4\) tube units using tubes with wires, end-plugs etc. Around august-95 we plan to use thirteen of these jigs to manufacture tube units for a complete BO (prototype) MDT chamber.

## 7 Summary

From the tests described above we conclude:

* Mechanical accuracy of the structures (jigs and spacers) realized to date is better than 5 \(\mu\)m. This implies that the mechanical precision is not a limiting factor. Of course temperature issues are relevant!
* 30 \(\mu\)m results in quadro-layers with an r.m.s. in \(Z\) of at least 10 \(\mu\)m
- 15 \(\mu\)m. It is important to realize that eventually we very well might bypass this limitation at the \(2-3\) critical

positions of an MDT chamber: namely the tube position at the two end-combs and (if present) the middle-comb. Since at these locations we either might directly position the endplug, with a deviation from roundness of at most 5 \(\mu\)m, instead of the tube outer circumference and/or the deviation of roundness of a tube will probably reduce in the presence of a wire locator.
* Effective design parameters of e.g. quadro-layers can be realized simply and elegantly by means of small (adaptable) spacers in combination with a simple periodic wedge structure.
* Multi-layers with an r.m.s. with respect to effective design parameters of about 16 \(\mu\)m in both the vertical and the horizontal directions can be realized.
* The vacuum option should be pursued.
