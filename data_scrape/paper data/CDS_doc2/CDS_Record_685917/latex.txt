## 1 Introduction

### Physics Motivation

The ATLAS tracking system will play a key role in extracting physics both at the design luminosity, and during the initial low luminosity running [1]. At the design luminosity of \(10^{34}\) cm\({}^{-2}\)s\({}^{-1}\) the tracking will provide information on isolated leptons that will be vital to the exploration of the Higgs sector via the Higgs to four lepton channel. The tracking system will provide momentum information and pattern recognition information that will establish that the leptons are indeed isolated and do not arise from a background process. At lower luminosities, that are expected during initial LHC operations, the pattern recognition provided by the tracking system will allow an exploration of both \(b\) and \(t\) physics that are expected to provide a wealth of new information. For both high and low luminosity physics it is advantageous to have a tracking system with as wide an \(\eta\) coverage as possible. Tracks of interest are distributed roughly uniformly with rapidity. At high \(|\eta|\) the particle densities become very high testing the limits of available tracking technologies. Thus ATLAS has fixed the tracking coverage to be over \(|\eta|\leq 2.5\) as a suitable compromise.

Detailed studies of the physics processes and anticipated backgrounds have resulted in the following specifications for the tracking system:-

* efficient track finding of electrons and muons with \(|p_{T}|\geq 10\) GeV/c for \(|\eta|\leq 2.5\),
* \(|p_{T}|\) accuracy of 30% for \(|p_{T}|=\)500 GeV for \(|\eta|\leq 2.0\),
* polar angle resolution of 2 mrad,
* efficient reconstruction of tracks with \(|p_{T}|\geq 1GeV/c\) close to high \(p_{T}\) lepton candidates,
* good efficiency for tagging hadronic b and quark decays,
* enhanced electron identification for physics and 2nd level trigger.

In addition to these specifications there is a requirement to keep the total amount of material in the tracking volume as small as possible. Material in the tracking volume causes low energy tails in the calorimeter energy resolution. To minimize the amount of material in front of the calorimeter the coil length will be restricted to a length of 5.3 m. The ATLAS solenoid design does not include a field return path at the end of the solenoid, resulting in an extensive non-uniform fringe field at the end of the tracking volume. The design of the tracking system has to take this into account.

### ATLAS Inner Detector

To meet the physics requirements, the ATLAS tracking design calls for precision detectors at inner radii (\(\leq 60\)cm) and a continuous tracking system sensitive to transition radiation at larger \(r\) as shown in Fig. 1. To provide adequate information for pattern recognition the layout of the precision detectors has been designed to provide at least 6 hits at all values of \(\eta\). Tracking close to the interaction point is provided by pixel detectors arranged in two barrel layers and two disk layers. Two of the six precision hits are provided by the pixel detectors. Between radii of 30 and 60 cm precision hits are provided by barrels of silicon strip detectors in the central region and wheels of MSGC in the forward and backward directions. In addition there are disks of GaAs detectors at \(\pm z\cong 1.5\) m covering large \(|\eta|\) values and a full wheel of MSGCs at each end of the tracking volume. The full wheels of MSGCs are to provide extra hits in the region were there are limited numbers of hits from the continuous tracking and to assist in track reconstruction in the non uniform field region at the end of the tracking volume. The continuous tracker consists of straw tubes arranged axially in the central region and radially for \(|z|\geq 0.9\) m. This part of the tracker provides of the order of 40 hits at all \(\eta\), and is sensitive to Transition Radiation for enhanced electron identification by virtue of radiator foils arranged in between the straw tubes.

The MSGC section of the tracker consists of 24 small wheels located between \(0.44\leq r\leq 0.60\) m and \(0.9\leq|z|\leq 2.4\) and a large wheel located at each end of the detector at z = \(\pm\) 3.3 m between \(0.5\leq r\leq 0.96\) m. Each wheel is composed of 3 active planes of detectors giving u, v and \(\phi\) views. The MSGC detectors are tiles with a dimension of \(130\times 160\) mm. Foreach active plane the tiles are overlapped in \(\theta\) and buted in \(\phi\). Continuous coverage in \(\phi\) is provided for a wheel by locating tiles so that the gaps do not line up. Thus each wheel provides a spacepoint with internal redundancy.

### 1.3 Micro Strip Gas Counters

The Micro-Strip Gas Counter (MSGC) is a fast, high resolution, multi-electrode proportional chamber. Electrostatically, it is similar to a proportional chamber with a single sense plane. In an MSGCwires are replaced by a pattern of parallel strips bonded to a substrate that has an appropriate conductivity (Fig. 1.2). These electrode strips are, alternately, signal anodes and field-shaping cathodes. The sense plane of a flat MSGC resembles a finely printed circuit board and is generally produced using photolithography. Between the sense plane and the drift field electrode is the drift gas volume which for ATLAS is envisioned to be about 2.5 mm thick. Voltages are applied to the MSGC electrodes to a produce a uniform drift field throughout most of the gas volume with a high field region around the anodes. Particles passing through the MSGC produce clusters of ionization along their path. Electrons from these clusters drift towards the anodes where gas amplification occurs in the high field region above the anodes. For use in ATLAS the MSGC counters are oriented so that the majority of high momentum particles passing normal to the substrate deposit charge on one or two of the anodes.

#### Substrates

The choice of the substrate is the critical element in the design of the MSGC. The effective surface resistivity of the substrate must be high enough to keep power dissipation and the resulting electronic noise to a manageable level, but low enough to provide a means to neutralise the charge deposited on the surface. These criteria can be met with surface resistivities of about 10\({}^{13}\)\(\Omega/\Omega\). For high rate operation of MSGCs it is also important to minimize the charge being deposited on the surface. This is done by choosing the control voltages to produce a field that results in a minimum of positive ions drifting towards the bare substrate.

There are two categories of substrates that are in common use for MSGCs; one utilizes a material that has a bulk conductivity such that the effective surface resistivity is in the correct range, the other relies on a (semi-)conducting surface layer formed on an insulating substrate. The following examples illustrate the techniques that are currently being used. Schott semi-conducting glass (S-S900) can be used to make a good bulk conductivity substrate. It is made by including iron-vanadium oxides in the melt which allows electronic conduction to occur in the glass. By selecting a suitable concentration of these additives it is possible to produce surface resistivities of the correct order of magnitude.

There are two approaches used in making a suitable surface conductive layer; the first is to modify the surface of a highly resistive substrate with a technique such as ion implantation and the second is to coat the substrate with a suitable material such as nickel oxide. The ion implantation method can be used on substrates as diverse as plastic or a silicon dioxide layer grown on a silicon wafer. Resistive coatings can be applied either before or after the metalization layer. Some studies have shown that nickel oxide coatings on both plastic and glass can protect the anodes and cathodes during operation.

#### Electrostatics

In general there are three independent control voltages to set the fields in an MSGC; the drift voltage, the cathode voltage and the backplane voltage (assuming the anodes are operated at ground.) The drift field is determined by the difference between the drift electrode voltage and the voltages on the sense plane. The anode field is determined by all three control voltages. A typical plot of the electric field in the drift region is presented in Fig. 1.3. As can be seen from this field map a large number of field lines

Figure 1.2: Diagram of Charge collection for an MSGC.

originating on the anode terminate on the cathode. This results in a significant portion of the positive ions produced in the avalanche process ending up on the cathode rather than the drift plane. This factor reduces the tail on the MSGC pulse due to positive ion drift.

The fields in an MSGC can be arranged to minimize the field lines that cross the substrate. Achieving such a field configuration minimizes the collection of charge on the surface of the substrate and can enhance its high rate performance.

The operation of MSGCs made on thin bulk conductors is aided by the use of the electrode on the back side of the substrate. Applying voltage to this electrode affects the field above the anode/cathode plane and can produce substantial increases in gain. The situation is quite different with MSGCs made from surface conductors. If the ratio of the bulk resistivity of the substrate to surface material is greater than 500 then the backplane is effectively screened by the surface layer and has no effect on the fields in the gas volume. There is also a special case for MSGC printed on an ion implanted SiO\({}_{2}\) layer grown on a silicon wafer. In this case the backplane (the silicon itself) is of the order of 2 \(\mu\)m below the electrode structure and does have an effect on the fields in the drift volume. The field for these detectors has proved to be difficult to model because of the small dimensions of the layers however it has been shown experimentally that these devices can handle high particle rates even with ion-implanted layers of relatively high resistivities.

#### Operational considerations for MSGCs

For use in ATLAS, the MSGC detectors will be oriented in planes perpendicular to the beam axis. This means that stiff tracks will cross the detectors leaving a trail of ionization approximately perpendicular to the anode plane. The collection of this ionization is illustrated in Fig. 1.4 which shows the electron drift paths for tracks passing through the centre of a cathode strip.

An interesting feature of MSGCs is that they have reduced sensitivity to low momentum tracks or loops when used in the forward tracker (Section 4.2). This is because these tracks generally traverse the detectors at an angle to the anode plane such that the charge deposited in the gas volume gets spread over many anodes. In the extreme case of tracks passing through the gas volume parallel to the substrate plane, perpendicular to the anode strips, only 200 microns of track ionization is collected on each anode. This results in the amplitude of the signal on each anode being approximately a factor 10 less than the signal from stiff tracks. By appropriate choice of discriminator threshold an MSGC can be made blind to these uninteresting tracks.

For optimal operation of an MSGC a gas is re

quired that has a high specific ionization and a fast drift velocity. A number of different gases are being considered including ones based on Argon/DME and Xenon/CF\({}_{4}\). These chambers can be run at any pressure. Using a pressure above atmospheric would increase the specific ionization but would have the disadvantage of requiring more material to contain the high pressures. It is assumed in this document that a gas mixture at atmospheric pressure will be used. A suitable gas mixture at 1 bar is expected to yield greater than 30 electrons for a Minimum Ionising Particle (MIP) crossing 2.5 mm of gas.

The total ionization drift time would be about 50 ns per particle assuming a drift velocity of 50 \(\mu\)m/ns. Thus to achieve single bunch tagging front end electronics are required that optimize the timing information in the MSGC pulse [Section 6]. Gas gains in excess of 10\({}^{4}\) are possible with MSGCs although with a good choice of pre-amplifier it will probably be possible to run them at gains of about 1.5 \(\times 10^{3}\). (Low gas gains are preferred to minimize ageing and charging phenomena.) The other requirements for the pre-amps are that they should have low power consumption to minimize cooling requirements.

The properties of MSGCs as described above make them an ideal choice for use in the ATLAS detector. Other factors relating to MSGC operation are discussed in Section 4. For reference, some of the typical parameters of MSGCs are presented in Table 1.1.

## 2 MSGC Detectors in Atlas

### Purpose

The main aims of the ATLAS inner detector are to reconstruct all charged particle tracks with a transverse momentum above 5 GeV within a rapidity range -2.5\(\leq\eta\leq\) 2.5, and to identify electrons. The basic design of the inner detector thus consists of precision detectors for momentum determination and E/p comparison, supported by the TRT straw detector to enhance pattern recognition and electron identification.

In the forward direction the _B.dl_ of tracks is smaller than for tracks in the barrel region due to the finite length of the solenoid and the reduction of field strength at the ends of the solenoid. To provide the best momentum measurement in this region it is necessary to have precision detectors covering the full z range. This means that the area of the forward precision detectors is quite large at 50 m\({}^{2}\). MSGCs provide an economical means of covering this region.

Over the past 5 years MSGCs have progressed from being a laboratory device to being the active elements of HEP experiments. The first use of these devices was as beam counters in the NA12 experiment at CERN. This experiment capitalized on the high rate capability of MGSCs. A larger installation of MSGC was developed for the SMC experiment which utilizes 16 MSGC detectors with 8000 channels. These detectors were installed in the fall of 1993. MSGCs will also be used in the HERMES experiment. The NIKHEF group are working on the production of 100 15\(\times\)20 cm MSGC detectors to be installed in this experiment. Thus MSGC systems are an element in a number of current HEP experiments. It remains to be shown, as is true for other detector technologies that will be used in ATLAS, that MSGCs can survive the radiation dose anticipated at the LHC. The R&D work underway to demonstrate this capability is described in Section 3.

MSGCs have many features that make them attractive for use in ATLAS. These are listed here.

* The operational effective gain of an MSGC detector, typically 1500 (see Section 6.2), is very significantly less than the maximum gain possible before breakdown, typically 10,000.
* The intrinsic efficiency of an MSGC detector has been measured in test beams to be greater than 98% with a noise occupancy of less than 0.1%. When the efficiency for correctly assigning hits to a given beam crossing (96%-98% at high luminosity) is taken into account, the overall realistic efficiency is estimated to be 95%. Given the low number (six) of precision points on a track, it is essential that each point be measured with the highest possible efficiency. It is primarily for this reason that an MSGC wheel is proposed to consist of three layers. This provides a robust solution for forward tracking.
* Pattern recognition is more difficult in the forward direction than in the barrel due to the higher track densities. It is therefore vital that each wheel remains 100% efficient in this hostile environment. A 3-layer MSGC system fulfills this requirement.
* It has been shown that S-8900 glass substrates can withstand the expected LHC charged and neutral flux at r=40 cm without a significant drop in gain. Recent test beam results show that they operate well at a m.i.p. flux of 10\({}^{5}\)mm\({}^{-2}\)s\({}^{-1}\).
* Tests on the ageing characteristics of S-8900 glass substrates with gold strips and a clear gas system (but not clean chamber body) have provided excellent results. Extrapolation of these results indicate that after an accumulation of 60 mC/cm of charge, which is equivalent to 10 years operation at LHC, the gas gain will drop by 10% or less, assuming constant operating voltages. (See Sections 3.2.5 and 6.5.2.) In practice it is expected that this small change in gain can be compensated by an increase in cathode potential of around 5 Volts.
* If a strip on a substrate erodes or breaks, then it remains fixed to the substrate, and gives no problem in the functioning of the MSGC detector. There is indeed no loss of efficiency for this strip, though some loss of resolution. In any case there still remains the doublet of hits from the other two planes which will give a space point in 90% of the cases.
* Results from initial studies indicate that MSGCs will not suffer from irradiation damage by neutrons or other particles when the cathode potential is reduced. This could be a significant factor during injection and start-up cycle of the collider.

* Particles with very low transverse momentum trapped in the magnetic field, (loops), remain partially undetected since the ionization is spread over many strips, leading to a low strip efficiency and a reduced occupancy.

In conclusion we believe that MSGCs are the correct choice for precision tracking in the forward direction in ATLAS, since recent results have shown that they are detectors capable of meeting the physics requirements at a competitive cost, and able to maintain this performance over the lifetime of LHC.

MSGCs provide precision measurements over the forward region (\(|\eta|>1.1\)). The detectors are arranged in 'wheels' each containing three layers of detectors. In one of the layers the strips run radially and provide a \(\phi\) measurement. The other 2 layers have strips rotated by \(\pm 1^{\circ}\) to give'stereo' information while still providing an r measurement.

#### General Layout

The MSGC layout is driven by the inner detector specifications as described in Section 1. The outer radius of the active area of the MSGCs is limited to 60 cm by the requirement for a minimum path length in the TRT. The inner radius is governed by a compromise between occupancy and channel count. An inner radius of 44 cm has been chosen such that the active radius can be spanned by a single ring of 16 cm tiles, compatible with current production facilities.

The space available to the MSGC wheels in z is from 89 cm, the end of the service gap at the end of the SCT, to 270 cm, where the TRT inner radius decreases. In addition there is space for a final wheel at z=333 cm between the end of the TRT and the calorimeter, see Fig. 2.1.

The number and position of the MSGC wheels is determined by the requirement for 6 precision points over the full \(|\eta|\) range, ie. 4 points in addition to those measured by the pixels. Some compromises are required to fulfill the competing requirements of a smooth transition from barrel to forward in terms of pattern recognition and trigger performance and the constraint on the total amount of material traversed by tracks.

As a starting point for the MSGC layout, wheels were positioned in the available space so as to provide a uniform 4 hit coverage for \(|\eta|>1.4\). This layout is modified since the inner silicon strip layer extends to \(\eta=\pm 1.73\), so a maximum of 3 MSGC hits suffice in this region. At large \(\eta\) two measurements are provided by GaAs detectors positioned midway between the pixels and MSGCs, so only 2 MSGC points are required at \(\eta>2.1\). Behind the TRT a 'full wheel' containing 3 rings of MSGC detectors compliments the TRT by providing an r measurement in a region where no radial information is available from the TRT and gives an additional measurement at large \(\eta\) where the TRT coverage falls off. This wheel is important for maintaining good momentum resolution at \(\eta>\)1.96.

The wheel positions for the layout shown in Fig. 2.1 are listed in Table 2.1. A histogram of the resulting number of precision measurements on a track as a function of \(\eta\) is shown in Fig. 2.2. The \(p_{T}\) resolution is shown as a function of \(\eta\) in Fig. 2.3.

The strip occupancy has been predicted using a full simulation. At the design luminosity of \(10^{34}\) cm\({}^{-2}\) s\({}^{-1}\), the fraction of strips with hits is predicted to be 1.7% in the first wheel, rising to a maximum of 1.9% for the inner ring of the full wheel. The occupancy falls to 0.9% for the outer ring of the full wheel.

#### Layout Details

The MSGC detectors are composed of tiles 16 cm long and about 13 cm wide. The strips are arranged in a radial ('keystoned') geometry. Each wheel has

### 2.3 Specifications

three layers of detectors, a \(\phi\) layer, and two'stereo' layers (u,v). The dead space between adjacent tiles amounts to 0.8% of the active area, but the layers are overlapped so as to provide complete coverage with at least 2 layers. The positions of the tiles are staggered from one wheel to the next, to avoid 'cracks' lining up along a track. The 'full' wheels are composed of three rings of detectors spanning the radial space from 50 cm to 96 cm. The rings are arranged so as to give full radial overlap. The details of the layout are summarised in Table 2.2.

The readout pitch is chosen to give a r\(\phi\) position resolution of 26 \(\mu\)m per wheel, consistent with pattern recognition requirements. A small stereo angle of 1\({}^{\circ}\) is chosen to give an adequate radial precision of 1 mm with a minimum of 'ghost' points.

The total number of tiles and readout channels is given in Table 2.3.

### 2.3 Specifications

Many of the parameters and specifications for the MSGC detector have not been fixed at this point. To a large extent they will depend on the continuing R&D program which will allow an optimal choice to be made for the substrate, the chamber gas and the electronics. However it is possible to develop a set of reference specifications derived from the baseline choice which is described in the Technical Proposal. These are presented in Tables 2.4 through 2.8 in this section.

## 3 Substrates

### Overview

The functions of the substrate are to support the electrodes and to shape the electric field. We are working on the following substrates;

1. the iron and vanadium loaded glass S-8900 which has electronic conductivity,
2. the more conventional glass D-263, possibly with a resistive surface coating,
3. SiO\({}_{2}\) deposited on the surface of a silicon wafer and ion-implanted to increase its conductivity,
4. the plastic Upilex, eitherion implanted or coated with a material such as nickel oxide to increase its conductivity.

For the technical proposal we have described an MSGC tracker built on S-8900 glass because it meets all of the requirements at a reasonable cost. The MSGCs built on silicon substrates have also shown good performance but we do not consider them to be serious candidates because they are unlikely to show a significant cost advantage over silicon microstrips. A resistive coating on a lightweight substrate such as D-263 or Upilex could potentially be the best solution but we do not yet have sufficient data to convince us of the long term stability of this design.

It is now well known that for high rate operation an MSGC must be built on a substrate which has a certain degree of conductivity. This is because a small fraction of the charge produced in the gas avalanche falls onto the substrate surface instead of the electrodes. This charge must be conducted away or it will build up and distort the electric field in the chamber, causing the gain to change with rate. If one assumes that one percent of the charge in the avalanche falls on the substrate surface then the necessary resistivity of the substrate for operation at a radius of 40 cm in ATLAS is about \(10^{11}\Omega\)cm or \(10^{13}\Omega/\Box\). This resistivity is intrinsic to the S-8900 glass and can be produced on other substrates by coatings such as polysilicon, nickel oxide or lead glass.

The question of how to design a "keystone" electrode pattern which gives stable and uniform gain as the pitch tapers from 300 to 150 microns has been solved for a number of different substrates. The results are rather similar for all substrates and are collected together in Section 4.3.

The MSGC response to inclined tracks has been studied in great detail in the case of D-263 substrate. Since the variation of response with angle depends entirely on processes happening in the drift region, these results are valid for any substrate and they are described in Section 4.2.

Finally, we include a section on the tests which we plan to do over the next year in order to understand MSGC ageing with more confidence.

### S-8900 Glass

A glass with a resistivity of \(10^{11}\Omega\) cm has the ideal mechanical and electrical properties for an MSGC substrate. Some glasses with a high sodium content can achieve this resistivity by ionic conduction but there is the worry that a long period at high voltage will sweep ions out of the material and lead to a deposit of sodium near the electrodes or a rise in resistivity. So the conduction should be electronic. Good candidates are the glasses loaded with Iron and Vanadium II and III oxides, of which Schott S-8900 is an example [1].

Sections 3.2.1 to 3.2.4 will show that this glass is a good substrate for MSGC production in terms of the sizes available, rate capability, maximum gain and the resistance to spark damage of chambers built on it. The results of ageing tests of chambers built on S-8900 are reported in Section 3.2.5, they show satisfactory performance provided that the electrodes are made from gold. Our only reservations about S-8900 are due to its short radiation length but there may be solutions to this as reported in Section 3.2.6.

#### 3.2.1 Sizes and shapes

S-8900 glass is made in the form of a large glob or "boule" which is then sawn into plates which can be polished on one or both sides. Schott are willing to supply seven inch square plates with thicknesses down to 250 microns. At this thickness the glass is fairly flexible and can bend before snapping. S-8900 glass plates of 400 microns thickness are quite practical to handle without special equipment, this has been demonstrated by the fabrication of microstrip structures on glass of this thickness by VTT.

#### 3.2.2 Electrode material

The choice of which metal to use for the microstrip structure is governed by available production technologies, the need for the anode strips to have resistance below a few hundred Ohms and the effectthat different metals may have on the lifetime of the chamber. To our knowledge, MSGCs have been successfully made with aluminium, gold and chromium electrodes. Chromium is ruled out for large chambers because its resistivity is too high. The technology for depositing an aluminium film by evaporation or sputtering and for making a pattern in it with plasma or wet etching is widely available. Gold is problematic because it is more difficult to etch than aluminium. However, gold can also be deposited electrochemically on a very thin layer of another metal such as titanium. Most of our experience so far has been with aluminium electrodes and it has generally been satisfactory, but it is shown in Section 3.2.5 that chambers age less with gold, so gold is our baseline option.

The choice of drift gap and field is governed by the need to collect the charge as fast as possible. The field will be chosen to maximize the drift velocity of our chosen gas. The gap will then be chosen to give a drift time of 50 ns, assuming that the readout will use double correlated sampling with 50 ns interval. The gain of the MSGCs influenced by the drift field and this influence is slightly stronger for chambers with larger pitch, as illustrated in Fig. 3.1.

#### Performance at high rates

Extensive data has been taken in high rate test beams with chambers built on S-8900 glass. For example two chambers were tested at CERN, one with 300 micron pitch operated in an argon/DME 80:20 gas mixture [2] and another with a pitch of 200 microns operated in an argon/DME 50:50 mixture [3] Both of these chambers showed little change in gain or efficiency when exposed to rates of up to 5 \(\times 10^{4}\) particles mm\({}^{-2}\) s\({}^{-1}\) ( Fig. 3.2). This is a higher rate than will be encountered in ATLAS.

The efficiency of an MSGC never quite reaches 100% because of the small number of primary clusters produced in the gas gap, but Figs. 3.2 and 3.3 show that they do reach efficiencies around 99% with acceptably low noise occupancy.

#### Maximum Conductivity

The maximum conductivity allowable in an MSGC substrate may be limited by the acceptable power dissipation or by the shot noise. The resistance between anode and cathode of a \(L\) cm long chamber built on a substrate with bulk resistivity \(\rho\) is about \(3\rho/L\) where the geometrical factor 3 depends on the ratio of anode and cathode widths to the pitch and may vary by \(\pm 50\%\).

Assuming that the highest allowable power dissipation in the substrate is 6 Wm\({}^{-2}\) then we can calculate that the substrate resistivity must be greater than \(1.4\times 10^{16}\Omega\) cm. The shot noise is the fluctuation in the number of electrons arriving at the anode due to conductivity in the substrate during the 50 ns sampling interval. It should be small compared to the other sources of noise, which will be at least 1000 electrons, so the shot noise should be less than 300

electrons. This leads to a lower limit on the resistivity of \(1.1\times 10^{10}\Omega\) cm.

#### Ageing

Ageing of conventional wire chambers has often been observed but the processes involved are only partly understood. Over the last two years evidence has accumulated that MSGCs age in a similar way. What is certain is that molecules in the gas, which may either be intentional parts of the gas mixture or impurities, are broken up in the avalanche process. These reactive fragments may then polymerise and form a coating on any nearby surface such as the anode or cathode. The polymer is generally a good insulator and it blocks movement of charge from the gas to the electrode, causing a buildup of charge to distort the electric field and change the gain of the chamber. The chamber sometimes becomes unusable after the gain has changed by 30%. Some quencher gasses such as methane and isobutane are known to cause rapid ageing, whereas others such as dimethyl ether (DME) have given good results which are said to be due to the oxygen atom blocking polymerisation.

The amount of ageing is, to a good approximation, proportional to the total avalanche charge which has been deposited per unit length of anode. This allows us to carry out ageing tests which are accelerated by a factor of 100 with respect to the charge deposition rate expected in ATLAS and to be confident in the validity of the results.

The charged track flux and avalanche size quoted in Section 2.3, together with a pitch of 200 microns and an ATLAS lifetime of 10\({}^{8}\) seconds, leads to a total charge of 60 mC cm\({}^{-1}\). We allow a safely factor to account for the fact that accelerated ageing is not exactly the same as real ageing and to allow for charge deposited by neutron and gamma interactions so we say that a chamber must be able to survive a total dose of 100 mC cm\({}^{-1}\).

Comprehensive ageing tests have been carried out by the CERN/Novosibirsk group [4]. They have shown that in a chamber built on Pestov glass with gold electrodes and operated in Argon/DME 90:10 with a very clean gas supply and chamber housing, there was no change in gain up to 130 mC/cm. When the test was repeated with nominally the same equipment the results were not quite so good; the gain decreased by 20% after 65 mC/cm. This discrepancy was eventually traced to a teflon component in the second gas system which contaminated the gas. Another test using chromium electrodes on S-8900 glass in a lightweight glass housing showed 15% gain loss after 12 mC/cm.

Another systematic ageing investigation is being carried out at RAL [5]. This has confirmed the result above that a chamber built of gold electrodes on Pestov glass and operated in argon/DME 83:17 shows no ageing up to 40 mC/cm. They then went on to show that aluminium electrodes on S-8900 suffers serious ageing after a few mC/cm in the same gas mixture, but when they changed to gold electrodes on S-8900 the chamber survives 45 mC/cm with only 8% drop in gain (Fig. 3.4). When gold electrodes on S-8900 were tested in argon/DME 50:50 mixture they aged somewhat faster.

So the present status is that S-8900 chambers already exist that have survived half an ATLAS lifetime. It seems very likely that these chambers would have survived a full ATLAS lifetime with less than 15% gain loss if the tests had been continued longer. There is evidence that a gas mixture with higher DME concentration causes faster ageing. This is a pity because higher DME concentration also increases the ionization density and the drift velocity, but it is expected that a compromise between the two can be found.

#### Radiation Length

The Table 3.1 shows the composition of the glass according to Schott and the result of an assay by Alfred H. Knight.

The measured density of S-8900 glass is 3.42 g

factory is sufficient for the photolithography, however for the 200 \(\mu\)m glass a heat treatment at 530\({}^{\circ}\)C is necessary to reduce surface irregularities and remove internal stresses. The conductivity is caused by migration of free electrons and of Nations [6]. The latter effect cause a gradual increase of the gas gain at moderate fluxes of 4% per month at room temperature [7]. It has been shown [6] that by reversing the polarity of the strip voltage the ionic movement can be reversed.

Due to the high bulk resistivity, (\(10^{15}\Omega\):m equivalent to a surface resistivity of about \(10^{17}\Omega/\Omega\) ) there is a decrease of 20% in gain, caused by charging up of the substrate at the rate that is expected at the LHC (Fig. 3.5). Therefore we consider coating it with a layer having a resistivity of \(10^{13}-10^{15}\Omega/\Omega\).

#### 3.3.1 Resistive coatings

MSGCs have been made at Moscow on the following substrates;

1. three inch silicon wafers with insulating silicon dioxide SiO\({}_{2}\) (1.5\(\mu\)m) layer produced by plasma-enhanced chemical vapour deposition (PECVD),
2. 0.2 mm thick D-263 glass covered by polysilicon using PECVD and sputtering [8],
3. 1 mm thick borosilicate glass covered by a diamond-like layer.

In each case the thickness of the semiconducting layer was chosen to be 200 - 400 \(\AA\). The mask, with active area \(50\times 50\) mm, was produced by the firm "Angstrom"(Moscow). The anode and cathode strips were 10\(\mu\)m and 90\(\mu\)m correspondingly, and the pitch was 200\(\mu\)m. The aluminium strips, 1\(\mu\)m thick, were produced by chemical etching. The resistivity of the substrate in each case was tested at room temperature just after coating, with the results shown in Table 3.4. Experience of MSGC operation suggests that these resistivities span the range necessary for stable operation at high rate.

The MSGC on D-263 with a sputtered layer of polysilicon has been tested with radioactive sources. The eight anodes strips were connected with one low-noise preamplifier and ADC. Using an Ar/Isobutane 40:60 gas mixture the amplitude distribution from Sr\({}^{90}\) had a maximum at 45,000 \(e^{-}\), corresponding to a gas gain of \(1.7\times 10^{3}\).

The time dependence of the gain when the high voltage was switched on is given in Fig. 3.6 at a flux of \(10^{4}\) counts mm\({}^{-2}\) s\({}^{-1}\). Good dynamic characteristics of the detector is observed. A high rate test was performed with 8 keV X-rays. The relative gain measurements versus irradiation rate are given in Fig. 3.6. Stable operation of the detector was observed up to a rate of \(10^{4}\) counts mm\({}^{-2}\) s\({}^{-1}\). At higher rates a slight decrease of gain was observed. Thus the maximum expected rate for LHC of \(10^{5}\) counts mm\({}^{-2}\) s\({}^{-1}\) can be achieved.

### Silicon Dioxide

In general, MSGCs have been fabricated using substrates consisting of a homogeneous, semiconducting, material. Such MSGCs allow the position of a particle to be measured in one co-ordinate only. By using standard semiconductor micro-fabrication techniques it is possible to develop MSGCs, based on silicon or quartz substrates. These devices have different electric field characteristics to those on bulk substrates and offer the option of two co-ordinate readout from a

\end{table}

#### Substrate geometry

Figure 3.7 shows a schematic of the electrode geometry for an MSGC with single co-ordinate readout based on a silicon wafer viewed in cross-section through the substrate. The anode and cathode widths are 10\(\mu\)m and 70\(\mu\)m respectively and the anode-anode pitch is 200\(\mu\)m. The thin SiO\({}_{2}\) insulating layer is formed in a two stage process. Thermal oxidation is used to deposit the first micron and plasma-enhanced chemical vapour deposition (PE-CVD) is used to increase the thickness to 3 or 4 \(\mu\)m. The silicon wafer acts as the mechanical support and the back-electrode. The oxide surface has to be treated in some way to increase the conductivity thus reducing charge-up problems. Two techniques have been investigated: boron ion implantation and phosphor silicate glass (PSG) deposition.

Ion implantation is a standard technique in the semiconductor industry. In this application the oxide surface is bombarded with 80 keV boron ions to a dose of \(4\times 10^{16}\) per cm\({}^{2}\). Note that it is the damage caused by the implantation process rather than the presence of the boron in the oxide that creates the conductivity [10]. Whilst the range of boron ions in SiO\({}_{2}\) is about 0.29\(\mu\)m the damage is limited to the first tens of nanometres at the surface. The electrical conductivity results from a removal of oxygen atoms from the surface thus modifying the stoichiometry. The material is then SiO\({}_{x}\) where \(x<2\). Since the doses required for MSGC fabrication are rather high, the implantation process-step is the main cost driver in this type of MSGC.

PSG is used in the semiconductor industry as a passivating material, produced by a CVD process, using a mixture of phosphine and silane gasses. The conductivity depends on the fraction of phosphine in the mixture. However, large phosphine concentrations cause erosion problems with aluminium metalisation and a safe working limit of 8% is used. The thickness of the PSG layer can be accurately controlled over a wide range. MSGCs have been fabricated using an 8% phosphine concentration and a 1\(\mu\)m layer thickness.

Silicon wafers are available in a variety of standard sizes defined by the diameter of the wafer measured in inches: 4, 6, 8, 10 and 12 inches. Currently wafers of 8 inches and larger are relatively expensive and the number of fabrication sites is limited. For this reason the wafer size for MSGC production is limited to 6 inches giving an active area of 10 cm \(\times\) 10 cm. This has an impact on the layout of the tracker since more substrates and electronics channels are needed

to cover the same area.

#### Simulation of MSGC response

Extensive simulations of thin-oxide MSGCs have been performed using a combination of a commercial electric field solver [11], and a full monte-carlo simulation of the response of the system to ionising radiation [12]. The most important factor in determining the behaviour of thin-oxide devices is the electrical conductivity of the surface. In the absence of sufficient conductivity the back-plane electrode is dominant in determining the static electric field in the region near the anode. If the back-electrode has a large negative (with respect to the anode) potential e.g. Vb=Vc=-420V this causes positive ion drift paths to terminate on the inter-metal surface creating a build-up of positive charge. This leads to a fall in electric field and hence gas gain. Conversely, if the surface conductivity is too high, the anode electric field is suppressed leading to a low gas gain. However, electrons are accumulated on the surface, modifying the electric field and increasing the gas gain. In either case an equilibrium is reached when the surface charge density is such that the electric field lines correctly terminate on the electrodes.

Typically the substrate is modelled using a 0.25 \(\mu\)m thick layer of conductivity 500 times that of the bulk oxide. With standard operating potentials (Vc=Vb=-420 V, Vd=-2000 V) the electric field at the anode is computed to be about 20 MV.m\({}^{-1}\) giving a gas gain of about 1000. This is in agreement with experimental measurements. Figure 3.8 shows the variation of the electric field at the middle of the anode as a function of the parameter t.ss/sv, where t is the thickness of the conductive layer and ss and sv are the conductivities of the surface and bulk oxide respectively, for different thickness and ss/sv ratios. These results show that substrates with surface layers of different conductivity will behave in a similar way provided that the thickness is correctly controlled.

#### Short-term stability

Figure 3.9 shows a plot of the relative gas gain as a function of time for an ion-implanted chamber using Fe\({}^{55}\) X-rays. The time origin corresponds to the instant that the X-ray flux is applied. The gain falls by about 30% due to the accumulation of positive charge on the inter-metal surface. Following this initial fall the chambers are very stable and will tolerate high rates without further loss in gain, see below. For comparison, Fig. 3.10 shows a plot of the relative gas gain as a function of time for a PSG chamber. The steps in gain correspond to the instant at which the x-ray flux is changed. At each increase in rate the gas gain rises over a period of a few minutes. Note also that when the rate is reduced to the initial value the gas gain falls to the asymptotic value observed at the initial rate.

We conclude that ion-implantation has only been partially successful in screening the back electrode leading to positive charging. In contrast, the PSG

layer is too conductive leading to an effective broadening of the anode and a tendency for electrons to be deposited on the surface leading to an increase in the anode electric field and hence the gas gain.

#### Performance at high rates

The high rate behaviour of the two types of substrate is somewhat different. As shown in Fig. 3.10 the gas gain of the PSG chamber increases with rate but is stable in time if the rate is constant. Figure 3.11 shows the relative gas gain as a function of rate for an ion-implanted chamber illuminated with a 1 mm diameter beam of 8 keV X-rays. This shows that once the gain has stabilised the gas gain is nearly independent of rate, dropping by about 6% at 300 kHz. Note that the estimated charged particle rate at LHC corresponds to an X-ray rate of a few kHz when the difference in avalanche charges is accounted for. Therefore both types of substrate would tolerate the expected LHC rate.

#### Charged particle detection

The performance of single co-ordinate readout thin-oxide MSGCs has been investigated in a beam of minimum ionising particles [13]. The chambers were readout using the 128 channel MX3 silicon readout chip with a single channel electronic noise of about 2,500 e. The MX3 front end amplifier integrates for several hundred nanoseconds collecting all the signal. This is in contrast to the situation at LHC were about 50% of the signal is collected in two bunch crossings. Due to technical difficulties, the electronic noise was significantly worse than that anticipated with LHC-type electronics. These two effects combine to give a signal/noise ratio comparable to that expected at LHC for an avalanche charge of 30k electrons.

Figure 3.12 shows the variation of efficiency with gas composition for a 3\(\sigma\) threshold cut. Note that the data at 80:20 and 70:30 were taken using a gas gain of 600, corresponding to an avalanche charge of 17k electrons whilst the data at 50:50 and 15:85 were taken at a gas gain of 1000 giving a 27k electron signal. The efficiency for Ar/DME 50:50 and Ar/DME 15:85 is 95%. Figure 3.13 shows the position resolution, measured using tracks defined in a four-plane silicon telescope, as a function of DME fraction. The MSGC hit positions were computed from a charge-weighted barycentre of the largest pulse and its two nearest neighbours. There is little difference between the mixtures. Also shown is the improvement in the resolution if a non-linearity function, computed using the full MSGC simulation, is applied to the barycentre calculation.

Ageing measurements have been made on a series of ion-implanted SiO2 substrates using a 1 mm diameter 8 keV X-ray beam. The chambers have been operated in both 80/20 and 50/50 mixtures of Argon and DME at a gas gain of about 1000 and a converted photon rate of typically 300 kHz. The gas is

mixed using a standard (non-stainless steel) gas system and distributed to the chamber via a 6 m length of plastic tubing. The MSGC module is formed of two NORYL/mylar gas windows sealed to a PCB (holding the MSGC substrate) by silicone rubber 'O' rings. The performance of the chamber is monitored using anode current, the photon conversion rate and the parameters (peak and FWHM) of the 8 keV X-ray peak. The gas is monitored using a single wire tube mounted in the X-ray generator safety enclosure on the same gas line as the MSGC.

In general the results with Ar/DME 80:20 are encouraging with two tests achieving about 40 mC/cm of anode strip with a 10 to 15% drop in gain [14]. Post irradiation analysis of the MSGC substrates reveals a brownish deposit on the side cathodes, and more predominantly, on the drift plane. This suggests that the gain loss is associated with the build-up of some semi-insulating material resulting from avalanche induced cracking of the DME (or its contaminants). Measurements with Ar/DME 50:50 are now in progress. Figure 3.14 shows the relative gain as a function of accumulated charge and the pressure (bar) in the chamber. The drops in gain at 10 and 20 mC correspond to increases in pressure of about 4%. In this test 40mC/cm were accumulated with a negligable change in gain.

#### Two co-ordinate readout

One of the major problems associated with the design of any tracking system at the LHC is that of the "material budget". The material may be reduced by employing detector elements capable of locating a hit in two co-ordinates whilst using the material normally associated with a single co-ordinate measurement device. The feasibility of such a device has been demonstrated for a thin-oxide chamber, using the silicon wafer (back-plane) as the pick-up. Figure 3.15 shows the ratio of back-plane pulse to anode pulse for Fe\({}^{55}\) X-rays. The FWHM of the distribution is about 5% indicating good proportionality. The Pisa group have demonstrated fully functional 10 cm \(\times\) 10 cm devices [15].

MSGCs with two co-ordinate readout capability may be developed from the thin-oxide MSGCs if the oxide thickness is increased to 5 \(\mu\)m and an intermediate metal layer is placed between the anodes and the back-plane. In this design the silicon wafer is merely a mechanical support and the fact that it is a conductor is detrimental to the performance. The proximity of the wafer reduces the strength of the pick-up weighting field in the region just above the anode leading to a reduction in the signal. In addition, the capacitance of the pick-up strip is high leading to increased front end noise. Both these problems may be alleviated if a quartz substrate is used.

A prototype mask set for a two co-ordinate MSGC has been developed using experience gained from a full simulation of the signals induced on the pick-up strips. The geometry of the pick-up strip is determined by the competing requirements of maximising the signal and reducing the capacitance and a width

of about 50 \(\mu\)m seems reasonable.

#### Conclusions

MSGCs with single co-ordinate readout based on thin oxide layers have been developed in collaboration with industry. The operation of such MSGCs has been investigated through experimental measurements and a comprehensive numerical simulation of the electric field and avalanche process. Two process specifications have been developed: boron ion implantation and PSG deposition. Whilst both techniques appear to work well the latter is inherently cheaper and is therefore preferred.

Thin oxide MSGCs are able to operate safely at the gas gains and particle fluxes required for LHC with high efficiency and good position resolution. The ageing characteristics have been investigated using intense X-ray beams. In a less than ideal gas system a lifetime of about 40 mC/cm has been achieved with a gain loss of less than 15 %.

The pick-up of signals on the back-plane has been observed. The design of a two co-ordinate readout device with a segmented back plane has been developed with the aid of a full simulation of the signal formation processes. A mask-set for a prototype MSGC with two co-ordinate readout has been implemented for processing.

### 3.5 **Upilex**

This lightweight plastic is available under various trade names: Kapton from Du Pont and Upilex from U.B.E. industries. We are presently using a 100 \(\mu\)m thick Upilex-S sheet but other groups (e.g. D0 at Fermilab) are using 50 \(\mu\)m polyimide. As its natural surface resistivity is high: \(10^{17}\)\(\Omega/\Box\), it has to be modified by ion implantation or by coating. Ion implantation has been carried out by Spire [16] who use 80 keV argon ions and total doses ranging from \(10^{14}\) to \(5\times 10^{15}\) ions/cm\({}^{2}\). Surface resistivities of \(10^{11}\) to \(6\times 10^{15}\)\(\Omega/\Box\) have been obtained. The resistivity is not modified via the incorporation of a dopant in the matrix, as is the case for semiconductors, but by the formation of a 0.1 \(\mu\)m thick amorphous carbon layer on the substrate's surface [17].

Alternatively, a thin coating of nickel has been deposited over the microstrip pattern by sputtering from a nickel target in an atmosphere of argon at 100 mTorr. The resulting film, measured to be 30 to 50 nm in thickness, is almost completely oxidized. The resistivity is found to slowly increase with time as the oxidation process finishes. Typical values for the surface resistivity \(\rho_{s}\), start at \(10^{12}\)\(\Omega/\Box\) and stabilize at \(5\times 10^{13}\)\(\Omega/\Box\) in a matter of weeks. The measured surface resistivity is larger than that simply inferred from the film's thickness and from the bulk resistivity of NiO. Hence, the final \(\rho_{s}\) may also depend on the structures in the film which in turn are strongly influenced by the sputtering parameters [18].

Until recently, there were concerns about carry

ing out precision photolithography on such a substrate. The expertise resided in the electronics industry and this was a "new" material for them. Initially there were problems of adhesion of the metalization to the substrate. This has been overcome and the companies concerned now know how to lay down a thin adhesion layer of heavy metal - usually titanium [19]. There were also problems with the etching procedures, particulary where gold metallizations were used. Now, both wet etch and lift off techniques yield precise edges down to the sub-micron level. The quality of printing has reached a level where there is less than one defect per print (of area 10cm by 5cm) and this figure is still being improved on.

Another concern was the method of connection to the traces on the substrate. Wire bonding is difficult with these thin plastic substrates. It can be done if special attention is paid to the substrate support and if an extra thick metallization is used near the wire bond site. However, an alternative method has been found which is much quicker and easier to apply. This is the heat seal connector distributed by Elform [20]. It has Ni-Au micro-spheres embedded in an epoxy matrix in the form of a long strip or tape. Connectors like these have been used in working detectors, in our TRIUMF beam tests (Section 3.5.1), and have worked well. This form of connection is also immune to chemical attack from DME and CF\({}_{4}\).

#### Beam Test results

Several MSGCs, with anode to anode spacings of 200 \(\mu\)m and 400 \(\mu\)m, were tested at TRIUMF in January 1994 in a 128 MeV /c beam of muons, pions and electrons [21]. A fast amplifier, the QPA 02 [22], was used with a rise time of 10 ns and a fall time of 20 ns. The signals were digitised by a 100 MHz Flash ADC [23]. The first part of the data taking used a relatively slow gas, Ar/isobutane 90:10 with a drift velocity of 34 \(\mu\)m/ns, and that was followed by a faster gas, CF\({}_{4}\)/isobutane 80:20 with a drift velocity exceeding 100 \(\mu\)m/ns.

Results on position resolution and efficiency are presented in Figs. 3.16 and 3.17. The data for these plots were taken with 400 \(\mu\)m pitch chambers and the Argon/isobutane 90:10 gas mix. Tracks were identified using data from the first and last chambers and the expected position in the middle chamber was calculated. Figure 3.16 is a histogram of the difference between the expected and the actual hit positions for these tracks. An acceptance region was defined, \(\pm 4\) standard deviations of the residual distribution from the expected position. A hit had to lie within this acceptance region to be counted as an efficient event. Values of efficiency were calculated and plotted as a function of the threshold and this is shown in Fig. 3.17. Also shown is an estimate of the pedestal and the RMS noise level produced by the electronics. For average operating voltages and reasonable pulse height cuts the detectors were running with efficiencies of up to 95 %, which was excellent considering that fast pulse shaping was used resulting in a loss of up to 50% of the initial ionization. The ATLAS scheme uses a longer shaping time and is capable of higher efficiencies. From the residual plot, the resolution of the chamber could be extracted if the contribution due to multiple scattering were known. This was found by making two measurements with different spacings between the chambers and assuming that the intrinsic resolution remained constant. These numbers gave a resulting spatial resolution of \(\sigma_{r}=150\pm 40\)\(\mu\)m for the 400 \(\mu\)m spacing MSGCs, which is in reasonable agreement with the theoretical value of \(400/\sqrt{12}=116\)\(\mu\)m.

The upper graph of Fig. 3.18 shows a typical timing distribution for a single anode wire from a subset of the 200 \(\mu\)m pitch argon-isobutane data. It shows a narrow peak at small times on top of a broader distribution whose width is consistent with the electron drift time over the full drift distance.

The timing resolution of the detector was taken to be the width of the narrow peak which was \(\sigma_{t}=17\) ns

for the argon/isobutane gas mix. The lower graph of Fig. 3.18 shows the typical timing distribution for an individual 200 \(\mu\)m pitch anode when CF\({}_{4}\)/isobutane was used. The CF\({}_{4}\)/isobutane was expected to be about four times faster than argon/isobutane and indeed the timing distribution supports this prediction. The timing resolution determined using the CF\({}_{4}\)/isobutane distributions was smaller than the inherent resolution of the FADCs (10 ns).

This improved timing resolution was consistent with increased electron drift velocity however some reduction in active gas volume by way of electron attachment [24] could not be excluded.

Data have also been taken with Upilex substrates in a high rate beam test at CERN. The results from these test are reported in [26].

#### High Rate Operation

The high rate measurements were performed using an Oxford Instruments, copper+arged X-ray generator [25]. The main X-ray was an 8 keV \(K_{\alpha}\) Cu line which meant that a photon of this energy, when absorbed in a gas, typically produced 15 times more ionization than a minimum ionizing particle and hence presented a worst case scenario for rate effects.

Figure 3.19 displays the dependence of the gain on the detected photon flux for the three low \(\rho_{s}\) samples under study. The ion-implanted devices were tested in a 90/10 Ar/isobutane mix while the NiO

coated device was tested in a 90/10 Ar/DME mix. The gain is independant of the flux up to a rate of 7\(\times 10^{5}\) mm\({}^{-2}\)s\({}^{-1}\).

#### Resistance to Chemical Attack

Upilex is quite robust and can withstand the chemical cleaning and etching processes used in photolithography. It has been successfully tested for chemical inertness with the gases used in MSGCs [27]. Samples of Upilex and K paton were exposed to pressurized (3 bar absolute) dimethyl ether and carbon tetrafluoride for a period of 2 months. Compared to a control sample exposed to pressurized dry nitrogen for the same length of time, neither the Upilex nor the Kapton showed any mass or length changes.

#### Radiation Hardness

A sample of ion implanted Upilex with a surface resistivity of \(10^{13}\Omega/\square\) was tested for radiation hardness by exposure to an intense flux of neutrons at the ISIS spallation neutron source. It received \(1.98\times 10^{13}\) neutrons per cm\({}^{2}\) with energies greater than 10 keV plus \(4.6\times 10^{14}\) neutrons per cm\({}^{2}\) with energies less than 10 keV, mostly thermal, Though there is some uncertainty on these numbers, it is fair to say that the dose exceeded \(10^{14}\) neutrons per cm\({}^{2}\). The electrical properties of the sample did not change within the measurement accuracy [28].

#### Ageing

Long term ageing studies are still continuing. There have been some encouraging early results, but much work remains to be done. Salomon [18] at TRIUMF has tested Upilex substrates with gold metallizations and a thin passivating layer of nickel oxide. He found no gain changes with up to 40 days operation with a 10mC \({}^{9}\)Sr source. The charge accumulation by the end of the test was 16.7 m C/cm.

## 4 MSGC OPERATIONS

### Choice of gas mixture

#### 4.1.1 Operational Requirements

Several basic requirements for detector performance affect the choice of working gas for the MSGC system. However some of these requirements are mutually incompatible and an optimum compromise has to be sought. The most important detector operational requirements, other factors such as signal/noise of the electronics being equal, are :

* **High Single-track Detection Efficiency** : This requires not only a high total ionization density (\(n_{e}\)), but also a high maximum sustainable gain, i.e. the maximum gain that can safely be achieved before electrical breakdown or other forms of unreliable operation occur. A low ionization density cannot be compensated by increasing the gas gap even were this to be geometrically acceptable because this would be in conflict with the following requirement of high BCO tagging efficiency. An additional prerequisite for high single track detection efficiency is a low electron absorption in the drift region.
* **High BCO Tagging Efficiency** : This (see discussion in Section 6) implies the shortest possible charge collection time and the shortest delay before arrival of the first primary ionization cluster after particle passage. The first requirement demands, for a given electrostatic configuration, the highest drift velocity for electrons. The second consideration demands a high primary ionization density. A low longitudinal diffusion is also in principle required for efficient BCO tagging but, for all practical gases, the effect is minimal. Clearly, the shortest possible gas gap is required consistent with good single track efficiency, i.e. high ionization density.
* **Good Spatial Resolution** : The effect of transverse diffusion coefficient of the gas (for a given chamber and electronics) upon the position resolution has been studied extensively by Monte Carlo simulation, the results of which agree very well with experiment [1]. The spatial resolution varies relatively slowly with transverse diffusion coefficient and most gases being considered have suitable coefficients in the region of \(70\mu\)m/mm\({}^{1/2}\) with a loss of resolution occuring if it were either much smaller or much larger.
* **Small Lorentz Angle** : i.e. small angle between the drift path of the electrons and the electric field. This requires a small electron mobility (drift velocity/electric field strength) which at first sight conflicts with the necessity of good BCO tagging efficiency, but is achievable at high field strength.
* **Rate Capability** : This is only affected by the gas if the electrostatics of the chamber are such that a significant fraction of positive ions produced in the avalanche go to the drift plane rather than to the local cathode strips thus producing a significant charge loading. Ionic mobility would then become a consideration. Rate capability has much more to do with properties of the substrate and electrostatics than with the type of gas.
* **Good Ageing Properties** : including ease of obtaining adequate purity and low sensitivity to impurities. Only intrinsic ageing effects due, for example, to polymerisation of the quenching agent are relevant to gas selection; problems due to other materials (such as glues) in the system are the subject of other studies (RD10 and elsewhere).
* **User-friendly Operational Requirements** : e.g., as far as possible, low cost, non-explosive, non-corrosive, and non-toxic. A small drift velocity that is relatively insensitive to variations in electric field, pressure, temperature, and magnetic field is also required.

#### 4.1.2 Gases Meeting these Requirements

The above requirements on detector operation thus result in the following list of intrinsic gas parameters:

1. **High total (\(n_{t}\)) and primary (\(n_{p}\)) specific ionizations**
2. **High drift velocity**, \(V_{d}\)
3. **High maximum sustainable gain**, \(G_{m}\)
4. **Low Lorentz Angle**
5. **Low electron attachment**
6. **Ionic Mobility** is relatively unimportant for the configurations of interest.
7. **Good Ageing etc** is an intrinsic requirement.

Although the optimum gas mixture in such a multi-dimensional list is still the subject of ongoing research, a suitable baseline gas mixture with adequate performance is already known - namely Ar/DME 50:50.

This "baseline" gas-mixture has been derived from many experimental studies (e.g. [2]) and the search for improved performance is guided by various theoretical considerations and by experimental work currently being carried out in several collaborating laboratories. The main thrust of these studies is directed towards finding the most suitable quenching agent to use in conjunction with the limited range of suitable main agent. The search is guided by the following considerations :

#### 4.1.2.1 Specific Ionization

The specific ionization is an important parameter and Table 4.1[2],[3],[4],[5] provides a useful guide :

The attraction of DME is clear and it appears to be radiation resist ant [6]. Xenon mixtures have been relatively little studied so far due to cost.

#### 4.1.2.2 Drift Velocity

The candidates from this consideration are mixtures of Ar/DME, Ar/iC4H10 and DME/CO2 which all have drift velocities in excess of 50\(\mu\)m/ns. Mixtures containing CF4 can give velocities in excess of twice this [7] and are hence being investigated, but electron absorption could be a problem [5] as could the Lorentz angle. Various mixtures of Ar/DME or Ar/CO2/DME have the best drift speed and do not appear to polymerise.

#### 4.1.2.3 Gain

Here, Ar/DME 50:50 is very attractive as are mixtures of Ar/CO2 with a small admixture of DME, e.g. Ar/CO2/DME 80-90:10-18:2. In the latter case the small addition of DME is sufficient to increase the maximum attainable gain yet with only a small addition of hydrogenous material.

#### 4.1.2.4 Lorentz Angle

For all mixtures discussed above, the Lorentz angle is acceptably low, viz. about 10\({}^{0}\).

#### 4.1.3 Conclusions

Although much work remains to be done to optimise the gas mixture, an adequate baseline solution is already demonstrated to exist.

### Inclined particle tracks

One of the strengths of MSGC detectors as proposed for ATLAS is their relative insensitivity to very low \(p_{T}\) tracks (or "loopers") which pass through the detectors at a large angle relative to the normal to the detector plane. This relative insensitivity has the effect of reducing occupancy in the detectors. This section describes experimental measurements of MSGC efficiencies for non-normal tracks.

Good resolution (30\(\mu\)m) and efficiency (98%) [8][9] have been obtained for MSGCs measuring minimum ionising particles travelling perpendicular to the micro-strip plane [10]. However the situation changes if the polar angle \(\theta\) is different from zero: electrons left by the track are spread over many strips. The charge collected by each strip is proportional to the ionization in the gas column above the strip. The extreme case is given by a particle travelling parallel to the strip plane, perpendicular to the strips. The particle path length in this column is then given by the anode strip separation which is typically 200\(\mu\)m. In this case the probability to have no ionization at all above a strip is high, leading to large inefficiencies per strip. The strip efficiency for such tracks was measured to be as low as 6%, in the same experimental conditions which produce a 96% track efficiency for orthogonally incident particles [9]. However, it should be checked that at intermediate angles, the strip efficiency and the resolution remain sufficient to be able to reconstruct the track of particles with transverse momenta down to a few GeV/c.

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:34]

Some free parameters in the simulation had to be tuned: the transverse diffusion coefficient and the relation between the number of liberated electrons and the eventual output signal in ADC counts for each layer. Each anode strip on one layer is assigned the same gas amplification factor. Note that with the threshold at 10 ADC counts, the setup is almost single-electron sensitive despite the gas amplification of only 1000. The transverse diffusion coefficient is found to be \(64\mu\)m mm\({}^{-1/2}\), well in agreement with earlier measurements at different settings of the high voltage.

It was necessary to distinguish between the electrons liberated in the drift field and those from the quadrupole region directly above the strips. The latter can undergo a much higher amplification because they do not follow the regular drift lines towards the anodes. When the angle of incidence is high, this effect can be seen as the average signal on one side of the cluster being higher than on the other side. As a rough approximation all electrons liberated in the dipole field are assigned a gas amplification twice as high as the others. This factor 2 was established from the requirement to get a good correspondence between the data and MC for this particular phenomenon. For a better approximation one needs knowledge of the electric field in the quadrupole region and the first Townsend coefficient over a wide range of E.

The main uncertainties that limit the predictive power of the MC are the effect of the energy spectrum of the cosmic ray muons, the variation in the momentum distribution as a function of \(\theta\), and the primary and secondary ionization process. These three processes each contribute around 5% to the total error on critical observables like the average cluster size.

#### Cluster size

Figure 4.1 shows the average cluster size as a function of the track slope both for experimental and MC data. The line represents the relation expected for the cluster size proportional to the track projection at any angle. It is observed that for all but the lowest angles (\(|\tan\theta|>0.05\)), the average cluster size is well below the expected value, due to the strip inefficiencies. It is above the expected value at perpendicular incidence due to diffusion. The tails of the cluster size distribution (not shown) reach just to the geometrical limit for all but the largest angles. Figure 4.2 shows the angular dependence of the average number of strips hit within a cluster again for the data and MC results. It is never above four at any angle.

Not only the number of detected strips is affected by the particle incidence angle, but also the charge collected by each strip. At small angles, the average charge decreases rapidly as the angle increases: it is already reduced by a factor two from \(|\theta|<5^{\circ}\) to \(|\theta|=15^{\circ}\). The MC accurately describes the data. The behaviour of the charge per strip implies that increasing the threshold influences strongly the number of hits in a cluster at large angles, but the efficiency at normal incidence is hardly affected. Contrary to expectations, the total cluster charge does not increase with angle despite the fact that the effective path

Figure 4.2: The number of strips above threshold in a cluster as a function of the slope of the track.

of the particle in the gas is inversely proportional to \(\cos\theta\). This effect is dependent on the strip threshold. Two effects contribute to the lack of charge at large angles. First, many strip signals remain below threshold at large angles and do not contribute to the cluster charge calculation. Second, the cathode strips are connected in groups of sixteen, without further capacitive decoupling. This causes a negative feedback of 6% between an anode with a signal and its fifteen neighbours. In the limit of a homogeneous charge distribution no charge would be detected at all. This effect tends to suppress large size clusters.

#### Efficiency

The detection efficiency of a layer, \(\epsilon_{L}\) is easily deduced from the fraction of fitted tracks that have at least one cluster in this layer with a measured position in agreement with the track fit prediction. No restriction is applied on the total number of clusters observed in this layer. Figure 4.3 shows \(\epsilon_{L}\) as a function of the track slope \(|\tan\theta|\), for various values of the signal threshold. It is seen that it remains above 90% at any angle, provided that the signal threshold is kept sufficiently low, of the order of 20 ADC counts. It should be noted that the cluster may be reduced to a single detected hit even at large angles. This explains why the layer efficiency is much higher than the single strip efficiency that is estimated below and why it increases at the largest angles, with the number of strips likely to give a signal.

The strip efficiency, \(\epsilon_{s}\), is defined as the average probability for one strip, to give a signal above threshold when a minimum ionizing particle traverses the gas column spanned by that strip. For a given polar angle range, it is measured as the total number of strips observed with a signal above threshold, divided by the total number of strips that should have fired. This last number is given by the geometrical cluster size, deduced from \(\theta\) (see Fig. 4.1), increased by a constant term d, that takes into account the diffusion and a geometrical effect: a track with \(|\theta|<3.81^{\circ}\), with a geometrical size of one, can leave half of its primary ionization over one strip and half of it over the neighbouring strip. Taking into account the layer efficiency and the observed hit multiplicity at small angles, we assume d = 0.68 in units of one strip, with a systematic error of 0.05 leading to an error on \(\epsilon_{s}\) of less than 3% for perpendicular tracks, and negligible at large angles.

The strip efficiency \(\epsilon_{s}\), is shown in Fig. 4.4 as a function of the track slope \(|\tan\theta|\) for various values of the signal threshold. It is observed to drop rapidly with the angle, reaching less than 20% for angles larger than 40\({}^{\circ}\) and thresholds higher than 20 ADC counts. The dotted line is the curve predicted by the simulation for a threshold of 20 ADC counts.

The figure shows, that the MC underestimates the efficiency for most of the angular range.

#### Resolution

The spatial resolution is obtained from the average \(\chi^{2}\) per degree of freedom of a linear four points fit through the measured cluster positions. It is estimated for three different methods to define the cluster position. The centre of gravity method, used up to now, is called the analogue method, and the corresponding resolution, \(\sigma_{a}\). The two other methods do not use the charge values and are called digital methods; the corresponding resolutions are labelled \(\sigma_{d1}\) and \(\sigma_{d2}\). For the first digital method the cluster position is taken as the average position of the first and last strips detected in the cluster. For the last method, the cluster position is attributed to the strip collecting the electrons with the shortest drift time, the first or the last one in the cluster depending on the sign of the polar angle. Figure 4.5 shows these resolutions measured with a threshold of 20 counts, as a function of \(\tan\theta\). It should be mentioned, that these resolutions include a contribution from multiple scatterings in the plates. Taking that effect into account the best resolution is smaller than 40\(\mu\)m obtained for tracks perpendicular to the strip plane and using the analogue method. What is surprising is that the first digital method is less than 10\(\mu\)m worse than the analogue method and this up to a deviation of 8\({}^{\circ}\) from perpendicular incidence only. At larger angles the resolution of the first digital method becomes even better than the analog one. The second digital method is definitely inferior to the other two at any angle but the increase in resolution is less than \(\sqrt{2}\) as would be expected if the first and last strips suffered from the same spatial dispersion. The degradation of the resolution with the polar angle is rather fast: the best resolution reaches already 300\(\mu\)m at 30\({}^{\circ}\) from normal incidence. At small angles (\(<12^{\circ}\)), the spatial resolution is almost not influenced by the threshold, at least for values not larger than 30 ADC counts. All these features of the resolution curves are well reproduced by the simulation. The MC underestimates the resolution by about 5\(\mu\)m at normal incidence. This can be understood by the fact, that the reference counters were far from perfect, so the measured track contained errors due to these imperfections. At larger angles the agreement between measured and calculated values is better, because these effects are negligible there.

#### Conclusion

In conclusion, the strip efficiency of MSGCs decreases rapidly as the polar angle \(\theta\), in the plane perpendicular to the strips, increases. In this particular setup, it falls below 30% or even 20% for \(\theta=30^{\circ}\), depending on the signal threshold. However, if required, large layer detection efficiencies, above 90%, can be maintained at all angles, by using a low signal threshold corresponding to about two primary electrons. As expected the spatial resolution degrades also with the polar angle going from about 40\(\mu\)m for perpendicular tracks to about 300\(\mu\)m at 30\({}^{\circ}\). In practical applications the spatial resolution is not an important argument to choose between analogue or digital readout as both methods lead to resolutions that are not drastically different.

### Keystone designs.

The geometry of the ATLAS forward tracker requires the MSGC detector to cover a radial space of at least 16 cm and full 2\(\pi\) angular coverage. Avoiding overlap regions (and thus minimizing the total amount of dead material) leads to a "keystone" pattern design in which the strips run radially. As the pitch between the anodes is not constant there will in general be a variation of gain along the strip unless care is taken to compensate with a variation of the cathode width.

Figure 4.5: Spatial resolution as a function of the track slope for three different methods of defining a a cluster position: the centre of gravity of the charge (\(\sigma_{a}\)), the average position of the first and last strip detected in the cluster (\(\sigma_{d1}\)), the position of the strip collecting the electrons with the shortest drift time (\(\sigma_{d2}\)).

### Keystone designs

This problem has been solved for S-8900, D-263 and Si/SiO\({}_{2}\) substrates as described below. First we discuss some features general to any substrate. The strip pitch that we choose will depend on the position resolution that is required by ATLAS, it will probably be around 200 microns giving a resolution of 40 microns. For a given range of pitches there is an optimum choice of anode and cathode width and thickness which will give a chamber having uniform, high gain which is not damaged by the occasional spark between anode and cathode. The anode should be made as bulky as possible without loosing too much gain so that it can absorb energy from a spark without disappearing. We have worked with aluminium thicknesses of 0.5 and 1 micron. A 1 micron thick anode can certainly survive more than one spark in the same place before being destroyed, whereas the 0.5 micron anode seems to be more fragile. The important point is that no trip can protect us from occasional single sparks and the chamber must be robust enough to survive them. The maximum thickness of aluminium electrodes is limited by etching technology to 1.4 microns. We have run chambers with anode widths of 7 and 10 microns, both have worked satisfactorily and so we choose the higher value for safety.

#### S-8900

In the case of S-8900 the results shown in Fig. 4.6 can be used to guide the choice of cathode width. They show that there is a gentle maximum in gain if the cathode width is about half of the pitch. The chambers A,C and F indicate how we can taper the cathodes to give uniform gain in a keystone chamber. The rule we have chosen is Cathode Width = 0.47\(\times\)Pitch - 32 microns.

#### D-263

Chambers have been made on D-263 with various anode-cathode gaps and various pitches between 100 and 200\(\mu\)m in 20\(\mu\)m steps. The gas gain of these chambers is shown in Fig. 4.7 as a function of anode pitch (P) for three different values of the gap between the anode and cathode. Those with pitches of 120\(\mu\)m or more showed stable operation. Fixing the gap at \(G=G_{0}=35\mu\)m, leads to a steady increase of the gain as a function of increasing pitch (triangles in Fig. 4.7). On the other hand, scaling the gap proportional to the pitch (\(G=P/4\)) leads to a steady decrease in gain as a function of increasing pitch (diamonds in Fig. 4.7). Using the scaling law \(G=P/8+G_{0}/2\) one is able to construct MSGCs

Figure 4.7: Gain for chambers made on D-263 glass with various anode pitches.

Figure 4.6: Gain vs. cathode voltage for several chambers with different pitch and cathode width.

with varying pitch and gas amplification independent of the cathode strip voltage (open squares).

#### 4.3.3 SiO\({}_{2}\)

Measurements have been made of the end-to-end gain variation along the length of a 6 cm prototype MSGC with four candidate geometries using Fe\({}^{55}\) X-rays [14]. Table 4.2 shows the observed end-to-end gain ratios. The results show that geometries with constant-width anodes and a slightly increasing anode-c cathode gap give little end-to-end gain variations.

#### 4.3.4 Edge effects

In order to minimize dead are as it is desirable to butt keystone shaped chambers as closely together as possible. We have found that with a relatively simple cutting device, we are able to position two adjacent D-263 counters within 100\(\mu\)m precision thus losing only a single anode strip. In practice, this does not mean that there is a dead area; the region in between the two adjacent cathode strips will float up to the cathode potential so released electrons will drift towards the nearest active anodes.

### Programme for future ageing studies

A crucial part of the development of MSGC detectors is demonstrating that they will survive over the lifetime of ATLAS. This falls into two areas; the ageing of the active chamber, and the effects of radiation damage.

It has already been shown that devices constructed using the baseline design of Au electrodes on S-8900 glass survive an accumulated X-ray dose of 45 mC/cm administered during a period of about 1 month.

The aims of the ongoing program of ageing studies are to :

* continue irradiation of S-8900 to a dose of 100 mC/cm,
* determine the ageing properties of other candidate substrates,
* investigate the effects of gas mixure, materials and adhesives on the ageing process,
* verify the results obtained in the X-ray ageing tests by irradiating the detectors with the same dose from a Sr\({}^{90}\) source over a period of about 1 year.

Initial ageing tests will be performed at several of the collaborating institutes, the most promising designs will then be evaluated in a common facility at RAL using irradiation from both X-ray and Sr\({}^{90}\).

MSGC detectors are not expected to suffer from radiation damage over the lifetime of ATLAS. In order to demonstrate this, detectors will be exposed to a dose of 10\({}^{14}\) neutrons/cm\({}^{2}\) in the neutron source, ISIS, at RAL. In addition information on the effect of charged particles will be provided by MSGC detectors in the proposed WA102 experiment at CERN. During 100 days running in 1995 the detectors will receive a dose equivalent to 2 years at LHC.

#### 4.4.1 Other substrates

At RAL the ageing properties of the following materials will be investigated; S-8900 glass, a substrate based on S-8900 but with the barium content replaced with magnesium and a low sodium content glass sputtered with a thin coating of S-8900 glass.

In previous studies at RAL and NIKHEF the glass substrates D-263 and the similar Tempax gave poor results for ageing and rate dependance. However recent results from Bellazzini et al. [15] suggest that adequate performance can be obtained from D-263 under certain conditions. It is intended to try to reproduce these results in the lab at Manchester and NIKHEF and also during test beam running in early '95.

The ageing characteristics of D-263 glass with polysilicon and NiO coatings will be studied at Moscow and NIKHEF.

#### 4.4.2 Gas Mixture and materials

The choice of the components of the gas mixture, their relative proportions and purity has a direct influence on the ageing properties of the detectors. A gas must be chosen that exibits the required drift

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|} \hline Structure & \multicolumn{2}{c|}{200 \(\mu\)m} & \multicolumn{2}{c|}{300 \(\mu\)m} & Ratio \\ \hline  & A & C & G & A & C & G & (300/200) \\ \hline
1 & 10 & 70 & 60 & 10 & 70 & 110 & 0.70 \\ \hline
2 & 10 & 70 & 60 & 10 & 170 & 60 & 1.50 \\ \hline
3 & 10 & 70 & 60 & 10 & 130 & 80 & 1.15 \\ \hline
4 & 10 & 70 & 60 & 18 & 162 & 60 & 1.50 \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}

velocity and primary ionization, whilst giving satisfactory longevity of the detectors. In addition to the baseline Ar/DME gas mixture other gas mixtures, eg. CF\({}_{4}\)/isobutane, will be investigated.

An important part of the R&D programme is to identify which materials and adhesives can be safely used inside the gas volume and which should be avoided. Samples of materials will be inserted into clean detectors which will be tested under irradiation from an X-ray source. These tests must be made with all candidate gases.

The gas flow rate is also a crucial factor in these studies. The required performance must be achievable with realistic flows. Ageing studies must, therefore, also be conducted as a function of gas flow rate.

#### 4.4.3 Ageing with Sr\({}^{90}\)

Once the most likely candidate materials, adhesives and gas mixture have been identified in the X-ray tests, a less accelerated ageing test will be conducted using a Sr\({}^{90}\)\(\beta\) source. This will serve to confirm the X-ray results in a longer term test with charged particles.

Two stainless steel vessels have been constructed. Into one will be placed a detector constructed from the candidate materials. The other uses materials, stainless steel and ceramics, thought not to contribute to ageing, and acts as a reference. The detectors will be irradiated by two equal strength Sr\({}^{90}\) sources over a period of about 1 year to give a dose equivalent to 10 years LHC running.

## 5 Mechanics

### Introduction

The MSGC part of the inner tracker consists of two symmetric halves, in the forward and backward regions. Each half is comprised of 12'small' wheels with an active area spanning the radial space from 44 cm to 60 cm and a 'full' wheel covering 50 cm to 98 cm in radius. A wheel contains 3 planes of detectors; a '\(\phi\)' plane with anode and cathode strips running radially and'stereo', u and v, planes with detectors rotated at \(\pm 1^{\circ}\). The full wheels contain 3 concentric rings of detectors, while the small wheels contain a single ring. To minimize the overlap of dead areas, detectors are staggered within a wheel and from wheel to wheel. Details of the layout are given in Section 2.2.

Two mechanical structures are being considered for the MSGC wheels. In the first 'open module' scheme, the detectors and electronics are housed inside a single gas volume. This design minimizes material and dead space between adjacent tiles. In the alternative 'closed module' design, each unit has an individual enclosed gas volume. This would enable maximum levels of cleanliness to be ensured, should this prove necessary for the longevity of the detectors.

### Supporting Wheel Structure

The MSGC detector units are mounted on a supporting disk with an inner radius of 37.5 cm and an outer radius of 102.5 cm. The detectors extend from the inner edge to a radius of 63 cm. Outside this radius, in order to minimize material, the disk is machined away to form a spoke structure, see Fig 5.1.

The disk is constructed from a carbon fibre sandwich which exhibits a very high stiffness-to-weight ratio. The sandwich is built up with facings of 0.25 mm carbon/epoxy and a core of 9.5 mm Nomex honeycomb (X\({}_{0}\) = 0.25%). The carbon fibre faces are covered with 10 \(\mu\)m Al foil which provides electromagnetic shielding and acts as a barrier to prevent moisture absorption and out-gassing.

In order to provide a highly stable structure, the carbon fibre supporting disk must have a low coefficient of extension with respect to both temperature and humidity. The coefficient of thermal extension will be in the order of 3-5 \(\mu\)m m\({}^{-1}\) K\({}^{-1}\). Further study and prototyping will be required before the details of carbon fibre type, number of plies, angle of fibres and resin type can be finalised.

### Open Tile

In this design, the MSGC detectors are enclosed inside a single gas envelope formed between the support disk and a 30 \(\mu\)m aluminized mylar foil (X\({}_{0}\)= 0.1%) and bounded at the inner and outer radius by

Figure 5.1: MSGC detector support structure

Figure 5.2: Detector modulea carbon fibre U-profile with wall thickness 0.5 mm (X\({}_{0}\) = 0.2%). All the components of the detector including the Printed Circuit Board (PCB), electronics and cables are inside the gas volume.

An MSGC detector triplet is constructed as two pre-assembled units. A '\(\phi\)' unit, consisting of a substrate and a planar drift electrode, and a 'u/v' unit with a common drift plane mounted between two substrates. Each substrate is bonded to a 1.6 mm thick (X\({}_{0}\)=0.8%) front-end electronics board. See Fig. 5.2. The high voltage distribution network shown in Fig. 5.4, is an integral part of the substrate and includes the current limiting resistors.

In order to position the detectors a very accurate assembly jig is used, see Fig. 5.3. The printed circuit board is located in the jig on dowel pins. The substrate is placed on a stage which can be accurately positioned in 3 dimensions. The stage can also be rotated to give the appropriate orientation for the 'u' and 'v' and '\(\phi\)' substrates. An optical system is used to align marks on the substrate with marks on the jig. The substrate is then glued to the PCB. The assembled unit is removed and taken to a bonding machine for the connections to be made between the electrodes on the substrate and the PCB.

A 'u/v' unit is constructed from a 'u' and a 'v' plane with an intermediate cathode. Plastic spacers glued to the PCB and to the substrate at the opposite edge set the drift distance of 2.5 mm. Alignment is achieved using the dowel holes on the PCB. The '\(\phi\)' unit is assembled in a similar way.

The MSGC units are mounted with dowel pins, three per unit, onto the supporting wheel. The pins are positioned with an accuracy of 0.05 mm, giving a tolerance for the mounted units of 0.1 mm. A gap of 0.1 mm is left between adjacent substrates. The overall dead area between detectors will be less then 1 mm.

After mounting the units on the wheel and installing all services, the position of the markers on the substrates with respect to alignment points on the wheel are determined by measuring machine to an accuracy of 5 \(\mu\)m, see Section 5.7.

#### 5.3.1 Materials

In addition to the requirements of low mass, radiation hardness and stability, special care must be taken in selecting the materials that will come into contact with the gas inside the envelope. A crucial part of the MSGC R&D programme, see Section 4.4, is to identify which materials and adhesives can be used and which must be avoided. In addition surface treatment and cleaning must be specified.

### Closed Module

Should the current R&D programme demonstrate that high levels of cleanliness are required of the MSGC's, it is unlikely that the 'open' module design, described above, will be adequate for large scale production. In this case a 'closed' module design will be used. In this design, Fig. 5.5, each MSGC detector will be built as a self-contained unit. This is essentially similar to the 'open' design, but with the addition of a frame between the substrate and drift cathode plus gas inlet and outlet connections. The gas would be circulated via individual inlet pipes to each module, flow through the module and vented into a common gas envelope. Venting in this way ensures minimal gas pressure differential across the module structure, which could otherwise cause bowing of the drift cathode plane.

With this design detectors could be constructed and tested at different sites before shipping for assembly. The disadvantages of the 'closed' module design are the additional material from the frames and gas pipes and larger dead area between modules.

Should this 'closed module' design be chosen, some minor modifications to the design of the support disk will be required to incorporate the gas feed pipes.

### 5.5 Services

The low voltage and slow controls services are supplied from a bus running around the wheel under the PCB boards at the outer radius of the detectors. A flexible cable connects the PCB to the bus. In one solution, the cathode high voltage supply is also connected to the PCB at the detector's outer radius, while the connection for the drift cathode high voltage supply is made at the inner radius. Cooling is supplied from a thin aluminium tube mounted in the outer U-profile close to the PCB.

Between the detectors and the outer rim of the support disk, the services are routed in the volume inside the disk facings, and are distributed over the full area of the disk.

### 5.6 Integration into the end cap tracker

The components of the end cap tracker are, from small to large radius; the GaAs disks attached to the MSGC wheels, the MSGC wheels themselves and the TRT wheels. The MSGC and TRT wheels are interspersed, see Fig. 5.6.

It is intended to design a single unit for each end cap which is located onto support rails by two bearings on each side. It should be a three-point suspension, hence one bearing must be spring loaded.

In the radial range of the TRT wheels, the MSGC wheels consist of 1 cm thick spoked disks (see Fig. 5.1). The TRT wheels have U-profiles on the inner and outer radius between which the straws are mounted. The TRT and MSGC wheels may be linked by connecting the U-profiles to the the spoke planes at either the outer or inner radius or both. The former may be preferable in order to avoid mechanical stress on the straws. For a good relative alignment linkage at the inner radius is prefered, since this is nearer to the sensitive region of the MSGCs. In this case either the TRT wheels or the MSGC wheels should additionally be linked at the outer radius to form a single structure supported on the four bearings. The engineering of this structure will start in January 1995.

### 5.7 Alignment

An alignment scheme proposed for the inner detector is outlined in the Technical Proposal. Alignment of any two subdetectors traversed by the same track depends on the initial assembly precision of each subdetector within its own mechanical structure and the positioning of these structures with respect to a common reference grid. Final absolute alignment is only obtained by using charged particle tracks of sufficiently high momentum that multiple scattering can be neglected.

An alignment table, shown in Fig. 5.7, has been designed which enables the position of fiducial marks on the MSGC substrates to be determined with a precision of 5 \(\mu\)m with respect to reference points on the wheels.

A reference grid for monitoring of the alignment is proposed in [1] and [2]. Alignment technologies to be used for this grid are Frequency Scan Interferometry (FSI) and straightness monitors which are described in [1]. FSI is used to measure distances in the grid which is then defined by triangulation. Straightness monitors are needed for measuring displacements transverse to some of the lines of sight for which FSI is insensitive. The fiducial marks on the wheels should be known with respect to this grid with a precision of better than 20 \(\mu\)m. Individual MSGC-wheels should be monitored with respect to the grid using three-dimensional straightness monitors which can measure the transverse (with respect to the beam axis) position with a precision of 0.5 \(\mu\)m and the longitudinal position with a precision of 50 \(\mu\)m.

The relative position between two MSGCs on different wheels or between a MSGC module and any

Figure 5.7: MSGC wheel on the alignment tableother subdetector is thus monitored with a transverse precision of about 40 \(\mu\)m and a longitudinal precision of about 70 \(\mu\)m. These positions should provide sufficiently accurate input data for final alignment with tracks.

### Quality control

One of the requirements of MSGC production is quality control of the substrates after production to ensure that delivered plates meet the specification.

Electrical testing of the plates, although necessary, is not a sufficient test. Optical examination of the pattern is required in order to check for defects which may only show up after assembly and/or prolonged use. We are developing an apparatus and procedure for rapid, semi-automatic verification of the plates after delivery, see ref. [3].

A digitized image of the surface of the MSGC plate is obtained using a microscope equipped with a CCD video camera connected to a PC equipped with a frame-grabber board. The MSGC is mounted on the platten of the microscope which can be moved under control of the PC. The image of that part of the MSGC tile within the microscope field of view is transferred to the PC memory, where it is analysed for faults. The microscope stage is then driven to the next area of tile to be analysed, and so on until the whole tile is completely analysed.

Pattern-recognition algorithms are being developed which identify faults in the anode or cathode strips. Faults which can be identified include such things as discontinuities (kinks) in the edges of strips, holes in the body of the strip, or blobs of metallisation outside of the required area of the strips.

With anode strips typically 10 \(\mu\)m wide we need 6-10 pixels across the width of the strip in order to have adequate resolution to evaluate edge quality. If we have a 256 x 256 pixel resolution this gives a field of about 250 \(\mu\)m x 250 \(\mu\)m per frame, ie. 1600 frames/cm\({}^{2}\). Current studies show, ref. [3], that digitization plus software evaluation of one frame requires 0.1 - 1 s on a PC with 486 processor. So the time to check such a surface could be 3 - 30 min/cm\({}^{2}\). This is at least an order of magnitude too slow for our requirements, but faster evaluation would be possible by making use of hardware on the frame-grabber board; this will be studied.

## 6 Front End Electronics

### Introduction

The guiding principle is to make best use of the MSGC signal: maximizing the number of genuine tracks while minimizing fake tracks and deadtime. The other important requirement is to identify the bunch crossing in which the event occurred as accurately as possible. Unfortunately, the factors which improve BCO tagging: fast shaping time etc., are usually at odds with the efficiency requirement. Pattern recognition studies are not yet available to say where the optimum lies, but since there are so few layers in the precision tracker, it is assumed that efficiency must be the highest priority with BCO tagging and reduction of occupancy, a close second. In pursuit of this goal the fact must be faced that any realistic detector inevitably has a few percent of inefficiency due to dead channels and geometrical cracks, which the track finding algorithm must be able to cope with. The magnitude of this realistic upper limit moderates the pursuit of the ultimate efficiency. The design of the front end electronics is therefore driven by the particular characteristics of the MSGC signal.

### The MSGC Signal

The MSGC signal, of which Fig. 6.1 is a typical example, depends to a large extent on the type of gas used. Here, and in later sections, a "standard" gas mixture of Argon/DME 50:50 is assumed. One advantage of this particular mixture is the large number of primary ionizations per mm, \(N_{p}\approx 4.5\) mm\({}^{-1}\). When combined with the narrow MSGC gap of 2.5 mm this produces a total number of primary clusters of 12 which still yields an acceptable theoretical efficiency of greater than 99.99%. These figures are a "worst case" scenario since they are calculated for minimum ionizing particles whereas in fact the particles of interest are highly relativistic.

Since there are on average \(N_{s}\approx 2.5\) ion pairs produced per primary cluster, the initial charge amounts to 30 electrons. These electrons drift towards the anode and are spread out over the surface of the anode by diffusion. The drift velocity, \(V_{d}\), is 50 \(\mu\)m/ns and the transverse diffusion parameter, \(D_{z}\), is 59 \(\mu\)m\({}^{2}\)/ns in the typical MSGC fields of 5 kV/cm. In the higher electric fields around the anode, the signal can be amplified noiselessly by factors of up to 2\(\times 10^{4}\) but conservative gains of one tenth this figure are typically used to allow a reasonable safety factor. The high fields near the anode also mean that positive ions drift away very quickly and a large proportion (\(\geq 50\%\) ) of the signal appears within 20 ns of the moment of the avalanche. The total signal is spread out over the full drift time of the chamber which is typically 50 ns, so integration times of at least this value are needed in order to record the full pulse height. There is a distinction then between the total gain, mentioned previously, and the effective gain as determined by the fast fraction of the signal appearing within 20 ns. The effective gain is important from the point of view of BCO tagging. Figure 6.2 generated from a detailed simulation of an MSGC [2] illustrates this point. The dashed line indicates the fraction of charge accumulated as a function of time. (The solid line is relevant to the section on SiO\({}_{2}\) substrates.)

The signal from a non-looping track is spread over one or two strips by transverse diffusion in the gas, there is some information about the track position in the relative charges recorded on two adjacent strips, but the accuracy of this information is limited. This facility could be upgraded by tuning the diffusion to optimize the effect. On the other hand low momentum "loopers" (Section 4.2) are spread out over several strips and the probability that any of the hit strips will record a signal above threshold is low. This provides a useful method of discrimination and re

duces the occupancy caused by such tracks.

### The Electronics Chain

The signal first enters a pre-amplifier which may be a shaper with an impulse response of \(\frac{\epsilon}{\tau}e^{\frac{\pi-\Gamma}{\tau}}\) or a fast integrator with an impulse response of \(e^{\left(\frac{\pi-\Gamma}{\tau_{I}}\right)}=e^{\left(\frac{\pi-\Gamma}{\tau_{I}} \right)}\). The pre-amplifier will introduce some noise charge which will also depend on the capacitance of the MSGC. A realistic value for this is 700 + 70/pF electrons. The MSGC tracker as described in the ATLAS Technical Proposal and Section 2.2 has 16 cm long strips leading to a strip capacitance of \(\approx\) 10 pF. The signal is then sampled at intervals of 25 ns at some fixed phase relative to the LHC bunch crossings and put into a pipeline (see later section). The samples may then be processed by deconvolution, double correlated sampling or some other variation.

When a Level 1 trigger arrives, the processed signal is read out if it is above some threshold. In more complex schemes the signal may be processed in a different way to produce a veto signal and if this exceeds some veto threshold, the channel will not be read out. The aim of this is to veto the readout of signals which do not originate from the beam crossing which caused the trigger. It might also be desirable to read out a channel if its neighbour is above threshold and is not vetoed. Two possible types of readout are considered: binary, in which a 1 means that the channel passed the threshold and was not vetoed, 0 otherwise, and analogue, in which the signal is digitised with sufficient precision that no information is lost - for example a 6 bit digitisation in which each unit corresponds to 2000 electrons.

The offline reconstruction forms clusters of signals from the adjacent strips which have recorded hits. The cluster algorithm may permit gaps of one or more strips within the cluster. In order to decide whether a gap is part of a cluster or whether it separates two different tracks, the position resolution \(\sigma_{x}\) of the MSGC is used. This must be known beforehand so that clusters can be associated with tracks.

### Performance Characteristics

Based on the above discussion, the optimum characteristics of an MSGC detector and readout scheme are listed below, in approximate order of importance.

1. High \(p_{T}\) hit efficiency, \(\left\{\epsilon_{hi}\right\}\). Given that a track with \(\theta<4\) degrees passes through the active area of an MSGC, this is the probability that it produces a cluster within \(3\times\sigma_{x}\) of the track position.
2. Accurate tagging of the bunch crossing in which the event occurred.
3. High \(p_{T}\) hit resolution, \(\left\{\sigma_{hi}\right\}\). This is the r.m.s. distance between the cluster position and the position at which the track crossed the mid-plane of the drift gap. The r.m.s. is truncated at \(3\times\sigma_{x}\).
4. Low Cluster Density, \(\left(D_{c}\right)\). This is defined as (number of clusters) \(\times 6\times\sigma_{x}\) / (number of channels) \(\times\) (pitch). It is the probability that a random point on the chamber is within 3 sigma of a cluster. It is most important that this probability is small in order to avoid problems with pattern recognition.
5. Low Channel Occupancy, \(\left(O_{c}\right)\). This is the fraction of channels which are read out. Important when considering sparsification.
6. High/Low \(p_{T}\) cluster discrimination. It will be possible to discriminate to some extent between clusters which are due to high or low \(p_{T}\) tracks, on the basis of the cluster width and charge. This discrimination may be useful to reject fake

tracks made from random combinations of clusters or to decide which cluster to link to a genuine track when there is more than one possibility.
7. Low \(p_{T}\) hit efficiency, \(\{\epsilon_{i\circ}\}\). As above for tracks with \(\theta>4\) degrees.
8. Low \(p_{T}\) hit resolution, \(\{\sigma_{i\circ}\}\).

### Simulation

In order to investigate and compare the properties of the various read out schemes described in Section 6.3, a detailed simulation [2] of the anode signal resulting from movement of electrons and ions in the chamber was made. As input to this simulation, the track densities anticipated at the LHC were used and the output of the simulation was used to test models of the readout electronics.

#### 6.5.1 The Tracks

The simulation describes a chamber of 400 channels and follows the signals on all channels over an interval of 10\(\mu\)s. Depending on the study being carried out, the following track types can be generated:

* A) A scattering of high \(p_{T}\) tracks. The tracks are arranged on a regular grid so that they do not interfere with each other. In a real event the high \(p_{T}\) tracks will generally be isolated from each other. The track position is randomized in space from one event to the next so that they cover the drift cells evenly.
* B) A scattering of low \(p_{T}\) tracks. These tracks are fully random in position so that they may overlap with each other. The angles \(\theta\), \(\phi\) of these tracks are distributed as they would be for a chamber which is at Z=150 cm and covers a radius from 40 to 50cm. The timing of these tracks is offset from that of the high \(p_{T}\) tracks by an amount corresponding to their extra time of flight relative to a particle coming straight from the interaction point. The average number of low \(p_{T}\) tracks is simulated as 0.01 \(\times\) strips \(\times\) BCOs, which is not far off the true value for an innerring.
* C) = A) + B), a mixture of high \(p_{T}\) tracks with a low \(p_{T}\) background.

Simulation A) is used to investigate \(\epsilon_{hi}\) and \(\sigma_{hi}\) without the complication of the underlying event, but the final values of \(\epsilon_{hi}\) and \(\sigma_{hi}\) are measured with simulation C). Simulation B) is used to measure \(D_{\epsilon},O_{\epsilon},\,\epsilon_{\circ}\) and \(\sigma_{i\circ}\). Simulations B) and C) are used to measure the hi/lo discrimination.

#### 6.5.2 The MSGC

The MSGC layout used in the simulation is an earlier version (the Annecy version) of that described in the technical proposal. The main difference is the length of the anode strips which will have an effect on their capacitance and hence on the noise. The simulated MSGC has 100 mm long strips at a pitch of 0.2 mm and the drift gap is 2.5 mm. The cathodes are connected in groups of 16. It is an inner ring chamber, covering the radius from 40 to 50 cm at 1.5 metres along the axis from the centre of ATLAS. The track density here is taken to be \(2\times 10^{4}\) mm\({}^{-2}\) s\({}^{-1}\) which gives a basic occupancy; (tracks)/(strips) \(\times\) (BCOs) of 0.01. The gas is Argon/DME 50:50 with the properties described earlier in Section 6.2. There is a detailed simulation of the ionization deposition including delta rays producing up to 200 electrons and having a finite range in the gas. The total gas gain is 3151 which gives an effective gain within 20ns of 1500.

If ATLAS runs for \(10^{7}\) seconds in a year then the chamber described above would receive a charge of 6.2 mC per cm of anode per year.

#### 6.5.3 Signal Processing Schemes

For all the schemes simulated, we have assumed that the noise is 1200 electrons, as would be expected from a chamber capacitance of 8 pF. For the readouts based on double correlated sampling (DCS), an integrating preamplifier with \(\tau_{\tau}=6.83\) ns and \(\tau_{\gamma}=227\) ns is modelled. The signal has been processed by DCS with a 50ns interval, i.e. 2 bunch crossings. The simplest option is to use no veto and test the DCS signal against a threshold;

\[B(n+2)-B(n)>4\times\text{noise}\]

Alternatively we have tried veto "A" which is the same as the one described as "Optimum" in ref. [7]. This requires that the signal, in the BCO selected by the trigger, is not significantly smaller than the signals in the previous or following BCOs. Define \(C(n)=B(n+2)-B(n)\) and require;

\[\begin{array}{l}C(n)>4\times\text{noise}\hskip 28.452756pt\textbf{and}\\ C(n)>C(n-1)-2\times\text{noise}\hskip 28.452756pt\textbf{and}\\ C(n)>C(n+1)-2\times\text{noise}\hskip 28.452756pt\textbf{and}\\ \end{array}\]

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:51]

primary electrons produced and the fluctuations in the avalanche process.

Thus, the five main criteria that the front end electronics must satisfy are:

* Sufficient amplification to allow the signals to be efficiently detected
* Noise: a target of 700 + 70/pF electrons, i.e. about 1400 electrons, has been set for this by comparison with the anticipated signal charge.
* Beam crossing tagging (BCO tagging): A number of schemes for BCO tagging have been studied [7]. Currently, the favoured method uses double correlated sampling as described earlier. These algorithms must be applied by the front end electronics which implies that the pre-amplifier used must respond quickly to the charge, i.e. have a fast rise time (\(<\) 20ns). This will enable the signal charge to be sampled within the 50ns period. In addition, the fall time must be long (\(\approx\) 300ns) so that the response to signals arriving later is not compromised.
* Power consumption: The total power used by the front end electronics must be \(<\) 1.5W per chamber, i.e. \(<\) 3mW per channel.
* Pipeline length: this is set by the requirements of the level 1 trigger latency to be 2\(\mu\)s.

As the ATLAS first level trigger philosophy does not require a tracking component, the read-out of data from the MSGCs should be synchronised with the BCO clock and on receipt of a successful first level trigger, ship data to the DAQ and second level trigger devices. The BCO clock and first level trigger will be distributed on optical fibre and converted to an electrical signal on the detector, minimizing jitter and providing an automatic timing calibration system for different signal path lengths. This requires a custom made ASIC.

A second system, possibly independent of the main data a flow, should provide means of monitoring the detector behaviour and give direct access to the front-end chips e.g. to enable the modification of thresholds, elimination of noisy channels etc. Such a detector control system does not need high bandwidth data a transfer. A possible solution is discussed in more detail later.

The actual data taking and data storage device, the front-end chip, will be clocked at the BCO-rate (40 MHz), while the maximum first level trigger rate is estimated at 100 kHz. The first level trigger latency will then be around 2 \(\mu\)s, which implies that the front-end chip should have an event storage capacity for roughly 100 bunch-crossings. There are various methods under study for processing the MSGC signals, all consisting of analogue signal shaping, while for the data transfer to the DAQ one may distinguish two different approaches:

* analogue signal transferthrough optical fibres,
* on-detector digitization and digital transfer via optical fibres.

For the latter system, two extreme cases may be distinguished. Digitisation by means of an on chip multiplexer and A/D converter or using one (or more) discriminators leading to either a single bit of information per channel (the binary system) or to a limited number of bits per channel (the semi-binary system).

There are a number of building blocks on the front-end chip that are relatively independent of the choice

made for the readout scheme. The final choice will be driven by test beam measurements and detailed simulation studies as discussed below.

### Binary readout scheme

#### 6.7.1 Introduction

The driving idea behind the FASTPLEX development has been the aim for simplicity, robustness and cost effectiveness. As discussed in Section 4.2, experimental measurements which agree with a simulation, show that after proper signal processing, the resolution obtained with a pure binary readout is only 10 - 15% worse (for the same anode pitch) than a full fledged analogue system. This result was obtained for high \(p_{T}\) tracks. For low \(p_{T}\) tracks there is no difference in resolution. The number of bits a (semi-)binary system produces after a first level trigger (without sparsification) is fixed and independent of the detector occupancy and contains, in addition to identifiers, markers etc., the data from all channels. Although the single strip efficiency for inclined tracks rapidly drops for increasing angles, low \(p_{T}\) track efficiency can then still be kept at an acceptable level [see Ref. [15] and Section 4.2] and thus still allows for low \(p_{T}\) track reconstruction. By applying multiple discriminators, high \(p_{T}\) tracks may be tagged for efficient level-2 trigger processing, providing a measure of the pulse height.

In Fig. 6.3 the overall architecture of the FASTPLEX is presented. In this scheme an integrating amplifier with separate test inputs (capaitive coupling) is followed by a fast (40 MHz) self-calibrating Double Correlated Sampling (DCS) filter/discriminator. Next, just in front of the digital pipeline, a masking register is incorporated to allow for the disabling of noisy channels. The mask setting as well as other test and control functions are carried out with Boundary Scan Techniques (BST). Dedicated functions are transfered through the detector control system. The digital pipeline accomodates the required first level trigger latency and is followed by a de-randomizing buffer (FIFO), which is controlled by the first level trigger processor. The data is than moved onto an 8 bit wide bus (20 Mbyte/s) which connects the FASTPLEX chips and drives the optical serial interface (200 MHz, 2 bits decoding protocol overhead).

Up to the first DAQ crate the system is fully data driven; no handshake signals are required as long as the total number of chips on the bus does not saturate the required readout time. The trigger logic allows for reading multiple 25 ns time slots in sequence.

#### 6.7.2 Fast amplifier/filter/discriminator

In order to optimize the signal to noise ratio, the charge collected at the strip should be accumulated as fast as possible within the time slot of 50 ns (the maximum drift time). As the charge is arriving randomly within this time slot, see Fig. 6.1 for example, it is important that the risetime of the amplifier be much smaller than 50 ns. On the other hand, by adopting the DCS scheme (see Fig. 6.4), the fall time of the integrator should be much larger than 50ns, so as not to lose efficiency. A fall time of \(\approx\) 300 ns appears to be sufficient [17].

At present a slightly modified version of the low power (\(<\) 300 \(\mu\)W/channel) (N)ICON amplifier is used (15 ns risetime), which has been demonstrated to be robust against excessive charge injections at the input. The integrator/DCS scheme will consequently reduce noise contributions as well. Due to the simplicity of the filter transfer function, a passive switched capacitor topology is adopted. In order to minimize interference due to either clock injection or digital noise, a fully differential signal treatment for the whole filter is implemented. The filter is followed by a comparator for which the offset is controlled via the detector control system.

The discriminator will be designed to be insensitive to pile-up. The calibration of each channel is carried out by an auxiliary on-chip-calibration unit and takes place at regular intervals. This procedure ensures not only the elimination of offsets due to mismatches, but also will eliminate effects of interference due to periodic digital signals appearing in the system.

The device may easily be extended to include multiple-level signal discrimination; a three (non-equidistant) comparator scheme will provide a two bit binary output every 25 ns at the expense of doubling the digital delay line.

#### 6.7.3 Low power digital delay line

A digital delay line (DDL) with fixed delay is used to store the information from the comparator. The total delay should be more than 2 \(\mu\)s, with a 40 MHz clock frequency. The number of storage cells is chosen to be \(\approx\) 120. In general, a DDL can be implemented by using a set of serial shift registers or by using a random access memory (RAM). Implementation of the DDL as a fully serial shift register using standard master/slave shift register cells would result in large power dissipation and are compared to a RAM-based design. To reduce power and area, the following approach is made:

1. the bits are shifted in parallel inside the DDL,2. N-phase clocking is used, with diagonal clocklines,
3. a dynamic shift register cell is used, with single NMOS transfer gate at the input.

The DDL therefore consists of N parallel shift registers M cells deep and an output multiplexor. It uses N non-overlapping clock-phases. The total delay is (N-1) \(\times\) M time slots. To build the N-phase shift register with diagonal clocklines, (N+1) \(\times\) M cells are necessary, N \(\times\) M latches for the parallel shift registers and N transfer gates for the multiplexor. For comparison: a fully serial shift register using standard master/slave shift register cells would, for the same delay, require 2 \(\times\) (N-1) \(\times\) M latches. In order to further reduce power dissipation, the number (N) of parallel shift registers can be increased, at the expense of an increase in the number of clock phases. The presently manufactured delay line consumes only 100 \(\mu\)W/channel.

#### FIFO and readout architecture

The FIFO, into which the data after the first level trigger decision is transfered, serves as the main readout buffer (similar in design to the delay line). Depending on how many time slots are required to be read out, the FIFO depth is designed to be large enough to minimize deadtime during data taking at maximum speed. For cross-talk reasons, the use of an asynchronous high speed readout clock should be avoided. The 8 bit wide bus provides a bandwidth of 160 MHz running at a clock speed of 20 MHz, i.e. half the BCO clock speed. In Fig. 6.5 the output buffer is shown. The data from the 64 channels is distributed over a current driven (minimum voltage swing!) bus via slots (0 - 7). The bus also acts as a simple shift register, controlled by shifting a synchronization bit (RFR\({}_{in}\)) in parallel. The synchronization of the readout of several chips onto an optical fibre interface is organized using the same RFR\({}_{in}\) signal and is depicted in Fig. 6.6.

At this stage, a first level data sparsification is introduced. When all 64 channels of the chip are 'empty', the data buffer of the chip will be simply ignored.

#### 6.7.5 Status

An 8 channel FASTPLEX version has recently been submitted. A full custom design version of the 64 channel chip is scheduled for May 1995. Both versions will be integrated in MSGC test facilities.

### Analogue readout scheme

#### 6.8.1 Introduction

In this section, an analogue scheme for reading out the signals from MSGCs in ATLAS will be described. The implications for both the front end on-detector electronics and the off-detector readout electronics will be considered. One criterion for the solution being proposed is similarity to the SCT analogue readout scheme, thereby reducing manpower and development costs. In particular, it should be possible to make the multiplexing and control of the front end, the data transmission from the front end to the off-detector electronics and the off-detector electronics itself identical. However, the differences in the signal development in MSGC's compared to that of the detectors of the SCT mean that the front end electronics cannot be fully identical.

#### 6.8.2 Advantages

There are four main benefits in reading out analogue signals compared to only a binary 1 or 0 to mark a hit on a strip:

1. Position resolution: from test beam data taken in July 1994, using a chamber with an anode strip spacing of 200\(\mu\)m in an Argon:DME 50:50 gas mixture, the resolution in the direction perpendicular to the strip direction was measured to be 41\(\mu\)m using an analogue readout and 50\(\mu\)m with a binary readout [5]. These results have been confirmed using a monte carlo simulation [6].
2. Discrimination against looping tracks: as they are not incident normally upon a chamber, such tracks deposit their charge on a number of neighbouring strips. Recording the amount of charge on each strip improves the discrimination of such tracks against the overlap of normally incident high momentum tracks and the diffusion of charge from such a track onto more than one strip.
3. Setting up: although it is impossible to quantify, it is likely that having the analogue pulse shapes available will make the setting up and debugging of the detectors and readout electronics considerably easier.
4. Neighbouring channels: due to the transverse diffusion of charge as it drifts through the gas gap, a single "hit" in an MSGC can cover a number of strips. Therefore, it would be a considerable advantage if the strips neighbouring one that satifies the BCO tagging algorithm were read out with it, even though they may fail this algorithm.

#### 6.8.3 Analogue Architecture

##### 6.8.3.1 Overview

A block diagram of the on-detector electronics is shown in Fig. 6.7. As mentioned in Section 6.8.1, the aim has been to keep as close as possible to the proposed SCT electronics. Thus, the on-detector design is based on the RD20 architecture [8], while the off-detector is exactly that being considered by the SCT group. The principle modifications necessary to the RD20chip (the APV5) to satisfy the MSGC specific requirements above are listed below.

1. The pre-amplifier. It is not yet clear whether the pre-amp. and shaper combination to be used on the RD20 chip, though tuneable, will have the correct properties for MSGC readout, i.e. fast enough rise time and slow enough fall time. However, data taken with a pre-shape 32 chip in the test beam in the summer of 1994 is currently being analysed to check the response.
2. The APSP. The APSP [9], the circuit on the RD20 that performs the deconvolution, will be replaced by purpose built electronics to apply the BCO tagging algorithm described in Section 6.6.

Each of the component parts of this electronics is discussed in detail below.

##### 6.8.3.2 The Pre-amplifier/shaper

The pre-amplifier proposed for the APV5 chip, the preshape 32, is a low noise CMOS preamplifier. As explained above, however, studies are currently underway to determine whether it has the necessary properties of fast rise time, long fall time and low noise. If it does not, other possibilities are (1) the NICON preamplifier: this is a 3GHz gain-bandwidth current mode CMOS device, with a rise time of \(<15\)ns and a power consumption of 300-500 \(\mu\)W. (2) a fast-shaping bipolar pre-amplifier: such a pre-amplifier, originally designed for SDC but with modifications to meet ATLAS specifications, is currently being studied by the SCT group.

Figure 6.7: The proposed analogue front end electronics

The various pre-amplifier options available will be studied over the next few months and in the test beam next year.

#### 6.8.3.3 The Pipeline

There are no special requirements from MSGC's on the analogue pipeline. Possibilities are the ADB for the preshape 32 preamplifier [10] and the DHARP2 for the NICON preamplifier. The buffer control, which controls the operation of the pipeline, will also be identical to the SCT.

#### 6.8.3.4 BCO Tagging Electronics

The electronics used to apply the BCO tagging algorithm described in Section 6.5.3 is shown in Fig. 6.8. A switched capacitor network is used to generate the three signals to be tested. These are compared to the thresholds using a comparator. If the algorithm is passed for a given triggered time bin, then the difference signal B(n+2) - B(n) is stored for that bin, as this will contain all the charge for a 50ns drift time. If the algorithm fails, a 0 is stored. The null suppression logic will, however, check the neighbouring strips and if either of these passes the BCO tagging, the difference signal is still stored.

The design of a chip to contain the pre-amplifier, pipeline, BCO tagging and control electronics based on the APV5 is currently underway. It is hoped that such a chip will be available for testing in early '95.

#### 6.8.3.5 Readout

As shown in Fig. 6.7, in the final design, 64 channels, each channel connected to one MSGCstrip, will be integrated onto a single readout chip. Thus, 8 chips will be required for each 512 strip chamber. Each such chip will be connected to a readout controller. The latter, which will be identical to that for the standard RD20 chip, generates timing and trigger controls, sets and reads the biases and chip status and buffers the outputs. The 8 readout chips and readout controllers for each chamber will be mounted on a single board.

The data transfer off the detector is only feasible viaoptical fibre links, which reduce the volume of material by a factor of ten compared to copper twisted pairs. There are two possible means for converting the electronic signals from the front end to optical signals: LEDs or passive modulators. For the latter, the currently prefered solution uses Multi-Quantum Well (MQW) modulators [11, 12, 13, 14]. These have a number of advantages over LEDs: (1) they are intrinsically radiation hard, whereas diodes, which rely on minority carrier processes, are in principle more susceptible to radiation damage; (2) the power consumption and heating from the modulator system is negligible, while the LED system for an analogue architecture would require at least 200\(\mu\)W per channel; [3] the modulator system is smaller than that of the LED's. The use of MQW's and LED's is currently being considered by the SCT group and their conclusions will be directly applicable to MSGC's. The MQW's will be mounted on a separate board from the rest of the front end.

If the MQW scheme is used for the readout, each modulator would have 128 channels connected to it, i.e. each MQW will handle 2 readout controllers. For each level 1 trigger, all channels would be readout. The data transfer would be via monomode optical fibres connected at the backend to photodiodes which would recover the electrical signals. These will be constructed in compact Opto-Electronic Integrated Circuits (OEIC's), along with the lasers, couplers and light guides that are required. The output signals will be de-multiplexed, digitised in 8-bit ADC's and zero-suppressed in preparation for the standard DAQ system.

## 7 DAQ, TRIGger and CONTROLs

### Data rates and data volumes

The data acquisition and second level triggering philosophy for the MSGCs is designed to match the DAQ architecture as proposed for ATLAS [1]. As the decision on the final hardware implementation of such an architecture will be delayed as long as possible to allow for the latest innovations, preliminary DAQ and trigger studies have to be carried out with current hardware.

The total number of channels for the ATLAS inner detector amounts to 5.6 x 10\({}^{6}\) channels contributing 850 kByte to an overall ATLAS event size of 1280 kByte at the front-end of the DAQ system. Folding in a 100 kHz first level trigger rate, this leads to an average rate of 85 GByte/s for the tracker alone. Roughly one quarter of this data will be produced by the MSGCs ( 1.5 x 10\({}^{6}\) channels). The data volume depends on the readout scheme; (digitised) analogue hit information will lead to larger data volumes and thus requires more buffer space than binary hit information. The physical connection between the 3,000 MSGC units, each having 512 channels, and the DAQ front-end crate should be capable of transferring about 20 GByte/s.

To minimize the amount of dead material in the tracker volume, optical fibre connections are the obvious choice to transmit the data. The bandwidth of these connections depends on the choice of technology (price/performance [1]) and defines the segmentation of the read-out system. To ensure that the readout system does not introduce any deadtime it is necessary to provide adequate buffering at the front end. The buffering must be sufficient to allow for the 2 \(\mu\)s first level trigger latency and to cope with peaks in the data flow. At high luminosity, the expected maximum strip occupancy will be about 2% leading to a read-out capacity of about 80 MHz/counter. Clearly, the occupancy will be an important design criterion for analogue systems, while the event size for a binary system will (without sparsification) in first approximation be independent of the track flux. The maximum first level trigger rate is estimated to be 100 kHz which leads to a single unit read-out capacity of about 16 MHz. Presently available low cost/medium speed (> 200 MHz) optical links may therefore be applied. A reduction in the number of connections may be obtained by daisy-chaining MSGCs in tracker areas with relatively low occupancy, so to saturate the available bandwidth.

Data from the front-end electronics is transmitted to the DAQ crates via optical fibres. Here the data is buffered. For the second-level trigger it is assumed that the local-global scheme described here can be used. In this scheme the buffered data will be transmitted to level-2 local processors on the basis of Region-Of-Interest (ROI) information provided by the first-level trigger. In the level-2 local processors track segments are reconstructed, which should be combined with the data from the TRT in level-2 global processors into larger track segments. After a positive level-2 decision the data in the DAQ crates is transmitted to the level-3 system.

There are various ways of implementing such an architecture into hardware. For both test beam and stand-alone tests a cost-effective hardware solution was chosen which allowed us to study data transfer and level-2 trigger aspects in detail. In the September-October 1994 ATLAS test beam runs we installed a flexible MSGC trigger and DAQ system for full communication with the central ATLAS DAQ system via transpurters. In Fig. 7.1, a schematic overview is given. During the 1994 run, we tested a digital read-out scheme using 20 MByte/s optical fibres. For this purpose a VME read-out module was developed with a VME-bus interface and a dedicated bus interface for read-out at full speed by a TMS320C40 digital signal processor. In this test, read-out via VME was demonstrated to function well. Readout with the C40 has still to be tested. In order to test the chain at full speed, a special VME device, which is able to deliver data continuously at 20 MByte/s, is under construction. Data to be transmitted is downloaded in this module via the VME bus. Hence it is possible to perform tests with realistic data (either data from measurements or simulated data).

This MSGC DAQ system was also successfully integrated with the RD-13 DAQ system and hosted by a SUN-workstation. For testing purposes both readout through VME and CAMAC was provided. In future test beam runs we plan to run our hardware as an integral part of the ATLAS DAQ system and second-level trigger (using the C40 processors). A study on local and global second-level trigger algorithms has been started.

### Detector Control System

The operation and supervision of all detector components requires a Detector Control System (DCS). At the sub-detector level such a system should provide detector experts the means of analysing and controlling the detector. In addition, the shift operator should have access to global detector information to monitor the behaviour of the full ATLAS detector.

Recently, a pilot project CANDIDE was started to both control MSGC front-end electronics and study the software aspects of a full system design. In this scheme each MSGC contains a multi-functional micro controller which can set values (such as thresholds, high voltage levels, and so on) and which can monitor the status of the detector (e.g. temperature, gas flow). The micro controllers are locally interconnected via a field bus. The segmentation of the field bus over the full detector is subject to robustness criteria. Nevertheless, a complete error check facility is provided at the hardware level. Optical links are used to connect the host system, a workstation in a Unix environment coupled to a VME-crate, with the field bus segments on the detector. For this pilot project the Controller Area Network (CAN) field bus was selected. A simplified schematic overview is given in Fig. 7.2.

The CAN field bus was developed to connect electronic devices within automobiles and is nowadays widely used in industrial applications. The applied physical connection is standardised (ISO/DIS 11898). It is expected that a simple configuration, containing a small number of intelligent nodes, will be tested in the 1995 H8 test beam runs at CERN [2]. Major emphasis has to be put on miniaturisation of the electronics chips and the use of radiation-hard technology.

From a software point of view, an interface has to be developed to integrate these low-level controls through a field bus, into the upper layers of the overall detector control system. A discussion has started whether to participate in the CERN DRDC project on control systems for LHC experiments (CICERO [3]) with a work package on interfacing field buses into the'software integration framework' developed by the CICERO collaboration.
