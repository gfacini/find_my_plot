order unity for the effects not correctable by the electronic calibration. Here we attempt to estimate only the standard deviation of that correction.

At time of writing this note all the modules have been manufactured, however only 2 of the 4 wheels have been constructed and rotated. Estimates of the position misalignments using data from surveys of these two wheels will be presented in this note.

The major module manufacturing variations that will affect the physics performance of the calorimeter can be divided into three categories and are:

Factors that will affect the calibration (by changing the sampling fraction) and the pulse shape (by changing the argon gap):

* The variation in copper plate thickness, and copper density.
* The variation in the nominally 8.5mm copper-to-copper gap.
* The variation in the fraction of the liquid argon displaced by the honeycomb.
* The variation in PAD and EST board thickness.
* The variation in the thickness of the four sub-gaps present between each plate (so the four gaps are not equal, and give different pulse shapes).

Factors that will affect the geometry:

* The variation in height of the modules (and gaps within the modules), in as much as it affects the z position of the readout electrodes.
* Geometric imperfections in readout board manufacture, in as much as they affect the r, \(\varphi\) position of the readout electrodes.
* The non-perfect alignment of the modules in the wheel.

Factors that will affect the X-talk and cause a variation in signal with LHC luminosity:

* The variation in the resistivity of the carbon loaded kapton on the PAD and EST boards

**Factors that will affect the calibration**

The predominant factors that affect the calibration do so either directly by changing the fraction of the hadronic showers energy that goes into making charges in the argon (for instance changing the copper thickness or displacing current producing argon with honeycomb), or by changing the drift velocity (by changing the argon gap and hence the electric field). In the following we will refer to the approximately 1.85mm argon gap as the argon gap, and the distance of approximately 8.5mm between the copper plates (in which 4 argon gaps are present) as the copper gap.

When a track passes through a single argon gap a triangle of charge starts flowing in the gap, the current is initially \(I_{0}\) and drops over time \(t_{drift}\) to zero, where \(t_{drift}\) is the time it takes a charge to drift in the electric field across the argon gap (giving rise to a pulse with 

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:3]

where \(\tilde{\bf E}\) is in kV/mm, and v\({}_{\rm drift}\) is in \(\mu\)m/nsec

\(\tilde{\bf E}\) = Gap Voltage / d\({}_{\rm ArGap}\)

Thus combining the above three equations we get:

\({\rm E}\) = 3.7 SK (Gap Voltage / d\({}_{\rm ArGap}\))\({}^{1/3}\)\(\quad\)= Constant S / d\({}_{\rm ArGap}\)\({}^{1/3}\)

A small change \(\Delta\)d\({}_{\rm ArGap}\) in the argon gap will cause a change in the observed energy:

\(\Delta\)E = - Constant S \(\Delta\)d\({}_{\rm ArGap}\) / 3d\({}_{\rm ArGap}\)\({}^{4/3}\)

so:

\(\Delta\)E / E = - \(\Delta\)d\({}_{\rm ArGap}\) / 3d\({}_{\rm ArGap}\)

and:

\({\rm E}\) + \(\Delta\)E = (Constant S / d\({}_{\rm ArGap}\)\({}^{1/3}\) )( 1 - \(\Delta\)d\({}_{\rm ArGap}\) / 3d\({}_{\rm ArGap}\))\(\qquad\).....(2A)

However during the calibration process the calibrator will be unaware of these variations in the gap. The process will enforce:

\({\rm E}\) = Constant S / d\({}_{\rm ArGap}\)\({}^{1/3}\)\(\quad\)using the d\({}_{\rm ArGap}\)\({}^{1/3}\)\(\quad\)nominal value,

by changing S to [S/( 1 - \(\Delta\)d\({}_{\rm ArGap}\) / 3d\({}_{\rm ArGap}\))] to compensate for the argon gap being different from nominal, causing equation 2A to become:

\({\rm E}\) = (Constant [S/( 1 - \(\Delta\)d\({}_{\rm ArGap}\) / 3d\({}_{\rm ArGap}\))] / d\({}_{\rm ArGap}\)\({}^{1/3}\) ) ( 1 - \(\Delta\)d\({}_{\rm ArGap}\) / 3d\({}_{\rm ArGap}\))\(\quad\).....(2B)

So due to the change in the argon gap the calibration has become S\({}_{\rm prime}\), which is given by:

\({\rm S}_{\rm prime}\) = S + \(\Delta\)S = S/( 1 - \(\Delta\)d\({}_{\rm ArGap}\) / 3d\({}_{\rm ArGap}\))

Hence in good approximation (\(\Delta\)d\({}_{\rm ArGap}\)\(\ll\) 3d\({}_{\rm ArGap}\)):

\(\Delta\)S / S = \(\Delta\)d\({}_{\rm ArGap}\) / 3d\({}_{\rm ArGap}\)\(\qquad\)......................... (3)

In the HEC calorimeter we have a slightly more complicated situation as we have 4 argon gaps between the copper plates, each being slightly different in thickness. Two variations arise in manufacture:

* Variation in the individual gaps due to the Honeycomb thickness
* Variation in the average of the 4 gaps in a copper gap due to variation in the spacers that hold the plates apart 

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:5]

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:6]

Giving rise to a variation in the calibration:

\(\Delta\)S / S = \(\Delta\)d\({}_{\rm ArGap}\) / 3d\({}_{\rm ArGap}\)

The fractional change in calibration \(\Delta\)S / S in the event of the total thickness (in interaction lengths) of one copper plate plus its liquid argon gap being different from nominal is given by:

\(\Delta\)S / S = \(\Delta\)(Energy lost per Copper Plate + Argon gap) / (Average Energy lost per Copper Plate + Argon gap)

Which in this case (where the energy lost in the copper \(>>\) energy lost in the argon) we will approximate by:

\(\Delta\)S / S = \(\Delta\)d\({}_{\rm Cu}\)/ d\({}_{\rm Cu}\).................. (9)

where d\({}_{\rm Cu}\) is the copper plate thickness.

The signal from the liquid argon is reduced by the fractional volume displaced by the honeycomb f honeycomb (of order 3%) by:

\(\rm I_{0}\)(observed) = (1- f honeycomb) I\({}_{0}\)(without honeycomb)

thus

\(\Delta\)S / S = \(\Delta\) I\({}_{0}\)(observed) / I\({}_{0}\)(observed)= - \(\Delta\) f honeycomb / (1- f honeycomb)...... (10)

The list of the construction variations and the equation we will use to estimate the effect on the calibration discussed above are summarised in the table below:

The density of the copper was measured at various institutes and is recorded in the database. However the degree of accuracy was not the same at all institutes. After carefully considering the measurements we have decided to quote the mean value of 8.93 g/cm\({}^{3}\). There was some variation batch to batch in the copper and we estimate this as having an RMS of 0.01g/cm\({}^{3}\) (0.1%). We note this density is less than the value for pure copper 8.96 g/cm\({}^{3}\) (Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 70\({}^{\rm th}\) Edition, page B-14), and the value given by the Copper Development Association (Handbook Part 7, Cast Products, (1996), page 7 and 9): 8.94 g/cm\({}^{3}\). The copper was typically \(>99.9\)% pure, with the most significant impurities being oxygen, iron, silver, and lead typically at the few parts per million level. So we recommend using in Monte Carlo models pure copper, with a density of 8.93 g/cm\({}^{3}\) (at 20C). The thermal linear expansion coefficient of copper is not a constant over the temperature range 80 to 300K. We find in the literature ("Physical value handbook", A.P. Babichev, N.A.Babushkina, A.M.Bratkovsky et al, Moscow, Engoatomizdat, 1991, p. 223.) the following values:

\begin{tabular}{l l}
50 K & - 3.87 x 10\({}^{-6}\) degrees K\({}^{-1}\) \\
100 K & - 10.5 x 10\({}^{-6}\) degrees K\({}^{-1}\) \\
200 K & - 15.2 x 10\({}^{-6}\) degrees K\({}^{-1}\) \\
300 K & - 16.7 x 10\({}^{-6}\) degrees K\({}^{-1}\) \\ \end{tabular} averaging over our temperature change window 293K to 80K this gives:

\begin{tabular}{l l}
8.93 x (1 + (14 x 10\({}^{-6}\) x (293-80)))\({}^{3}\) g/cm\({}^{3}\) = 9.01 g/cm\({}^{3}\) \\ \end{tabular}

Please note that if this value, 9.01 g/cm\({}^{3}\), is used the thickness of the copper as given in this report (at 20C) must also be corrected by the factor:

(1 - (14 x 10\({}^{-6}\) x (293-80)))

to allow for its shrinkage to 80K.

The gap between the copper plates is maintained by stainless steel spacers. The copper gap variation is due to the variation in thickness of these spacers and the amount these spacers indent into the face of the copper. The spacer variation (based on measurements of a small sub-set of the spacers that hold the plates apart) was found to be:

For mechanical reasons, there was an attempt during construction of the front modules (but not in the rear) to make the height of the modules have less variance than the maximum tolerances allowed. So front modules with systematically thin (thick) plates were corrected by having slightly thicker (thinner) spacers. To check if this produced a systematic effect, and also to find out the extent of the spacers indentation into the copper, the height of the components of the modules and their actual height was compared (see tables 5 and 6). From table 5 we see the modules are shorter than their sub-components, indicating that the spacers indeed indented into the copper, making the copper gaps about 0.02mm thinner in the process. This level of indentation (0.01mm on each face of the copper) is about what was expected, because when modules were taken apart only a very slight deformation of the copper at the spacers was evident.

As already discussed the RMS variation in the spacer height was measured (see table 4). This allows us to now compare (in table 6) the measured module height variation with the sum in quadrature of the sub-components (copper thickness plus spacer thickness). From

**The variation in honeycomb liquid argon displacement**

We purchase Aramid fibre honeycomb in aeronautical quality (Type ECA) the North American **product code is: ECA \(\%\)\(\mathbf{3.0}\)**. This is a non-metallic Honeycomb manufactured from aramid fiber and coated with a heat resistant phenolic resin. Aramid fibre is man made fiber resistant to heat, flame and chemicals. Dupont\({}^{\circledR}\)sells this under the trade name NOMEX\({}^{\circledR}\). The cell shape is hexagonal. The cell size (centre to centre) is \(\%\)\(\mathrm{inch}\) or \(6.4\mathrm{mm}\) (\(\pm\)\(12\%\)). The wall thickness is nominally \(81\mathrm{\SIUnitSymbolMicro m}\), and the nominal density is \(50\)\(\mathrm{Kg/m^{3}}\). The density variation is nominally guaranteed by the manufacturer to be \(\pm\)\(16\%\).

The 4 ft by 8 ft blocks are cut to thickness using a band saw. The purchased thickness is: 0.0715 inches (1.816 mm), with a commercially agreed tolerance of \(\pm\)\(0.008\) inches (\(\pm\)\(0.203\) mm). In practice the received product was within +0.00575 and -0.008 inches for all 11,000 sheets. The measured variation in thickness of the honeycomb sheets is:

However the variation in density is \(6.4\%\) due to variation in the wall thickness and cell size, so the displacement is dominated by the variation in these parameters. The density was found to be close to the \(50\)\(\mathrm{Kg/m^{3}}\) nominal:

The variation in argon displacement is estimated from the periodic measurements of the weight (\(33.8\)\(\mathrm{g}\)) of the cut pies (from which we get the variation in weight of the honeycomb mat), and a measurement of the density of the material of which the honeycomb mat is made (called here _density base material_) from which we calculate the volume of argon displaced by the honeycomb:

\(\circ\) 75 \(\upmu\)m Kapton\({}^{\circledR}\)

\(\circ\) 25 \(\upmu\)m Carbon Loaded Kapton\({}^{\circledR}\)

Where the thickness of the glue given in brackets is for the second production site, while the first production site is not in brackets.

The effective density of the non-copper portion of these boards has been measured to be: 1.43 g/cm\({}^{3}\) (at 20C, 30% humidity), 1.42 g/cm\({}^{3}\) (at 20C, 0% humidity). For use in the Monte-Carlo this must be corrected for the linear thermal contraction of 29*10\({}^{\text{-6}}\) degrees K\({}^{\text{-1}}\), giving a cold density of 1.45 g/cm\({}^{3}\) (at 80K). We propose the chemical composition of the EST and PAD boards (other than the copper in the PAD boards) be assumed to be Kapton\({}^{\circledR}\) (Polyimide film: C\({}_{22}\) H\({}_{10}\) N\({}_{2}\) 0\({}_{5}\) ) in the Monte Carlo. Please note the linear expansion coefficient for the PAD boards is dominated by the copper, so use the expansion coefficient of copper for contraction of the PAD board pad structure. But for EST's the linear thermal contraction is as given above.

The thickness of the PAD boards was measured to be (in microns):

\begin{tabular}{|c|l|} \hline

**329.0** & Average (\(\upmu\)m) \\ \hline

**2.5** & \% RMS \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 10: Average and variation of PAD board thickness We recommend using the nominal, given the sparsity of the data.

Every EST board was measured at the first EST production site:

The thickness of the EST boards was unfortunately not measured at the second manufacturing site, but as the materials are the same as the PAD boards (made at the same site) we recommend using the nominal value of 175 microns for these boards. In what follows we will use the 175 microns as the thickness of these boards (which are the thickest manufactured). These 175 micron boards can be recognized in the database by their serial number beginning in TE.

In order to study the affect of this variety of boards in the gap the variation in the average total thickness of boards in the gaps constituting a readout was studied for front modules. For the front modules, the average thickness of the EST's when averaged over both EST production sites is \(157\pm 10\)\(\upmu\)m (with the variance dominated by the difference in the two sites nominal thickness'). As most modules either were totally one type of EST board or the other we considered it most reasonable to study the two most extreme cases:

* all thin EST's
* all fat EST's

giving:

It is assumed the same variation is present in the ensemble of rear modules.

\end{table}
Table 12: Fractional difference of copper-to-copper gap filled with argon, due to variation in displacement of argon by the PAD and EST boardsThe variation in the 1.85mm liquid argon gap comes from the variation in the board thickness, the honeycomb thickness, and the 8.5mm spacer. The affect of these 3 variations is best estimated by studying the measured variation in the total height of the materials (4 honeycomb, 2 EST, and 1 PAD) in the gap with respect to the spacer. To get the variation in the sub-gaps we assume all the gaps are the same thickness except one that is larger by this height difference. This measurement was made at every spacer for every gap stacked in Canada. As spacers, honeycomb, and boards were not systematically different between Europe and Canada this data is a useful indicator of this affect. This measurement of the difference in the height of the spacer to the honeycomb was made with a 25mm thick piece of copper sitting on the gap materials. This weight tended to compress the "spongy" honeycomb. As the force per unit area of the weight of the copper is about 50 times stronger than any electrostatic forces potentially present in the calorimeter, this measurement will tend to overstate the variation in the sub-gap sizes (yielding a conservative (on the high side) estimate of the effect on the calorimeter performance degradation).

The design of the HEC required that the spacer define the copper plate spacing. So during manufacture it was checked that the height materials of the gap was smaller than the spacer, and if this was not the case the honeycomb was exchanged to assure this was the case. The figure below shows these measurements:

Figure 1: The variation in the difference of the height of the materials (EST, PAD, and Honeycomb) in the gap and the copper-to-copper gap. The copper-to-copper gap is always larger. The somewhat smooth variation is due to the honeycomb in adjacent gaps typically coming from adjacent cuts from the same block of honeycomb.

The high measurements should probably be ignored as this measurement was made only to check the spacer was higher than the materials, so some mis-assignment of the decimal place might be expected. The analysis of this graph gives:

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{l|l} \hline
**Gap Spacer – Gap materials height difference** & \\ \hline Average (mm) & 0.181 \\ RMS (mm) & 0.179 \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 13: Variation in the difference of the height of the materials (EST, PAD, and Honeycomb) in the gap and the copper-to-copper gap.

The variation in the average argon liquid argon gap comes from the variation in thickness the boards (table 12, line 3), in copper indentation (table 6, last line), and the 8.5mm spacer (table 4, line 2). As this is the average of the gaps in a copper gap the honeycomb thickness variation does not affect this value.

It is assumed, conservatively, that the spacers are not correlated, but the boards are fully correlated between adjacent gaps. So the spacer variation is reduced by the square root of the number of gaps in the readout volume.

\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|c|c|} \hline  & Gaps & Gaps & Gaps & Gaps \\  & 1-8 & 9-24 & 25-32 & 33-40 \\ \hline RMS 8.5mm Spacer (mm) & 0.031/\(\sqrt{8}\) & 0.031/\(\sqrt{16}\) & 0.031/\(\sqrt{8}\) & 0.031/\(\sqrt{8}\) \\ \hline RMS EST + PAD + EST (mm) & 0.02 & 0.02 & 0.02 & 0.02 \\ \hline RMS Indentation of Copper (mm) & 0.20/\(\sqrt{24}\) & 0.20/\(\sqrt{24}\) & 0.21/\(\sqrt{16}\) & 0.21/\(\sqrt{16}\) \\ \hline Sum in quadrature of above (mm) & 0.047 & 0.046 & 0.057 & 0.057 \\ \hline Thickness of Gap (mm) & 8.5 & 8.5 & 8.5 & 8.5 \\ \hline Fraction RMS Variation in 8.5 mm Cu Gap & 0.0055 & 0.0054 & 0.0067 & 0.0067 \\ \hline \end{tabular}

## Calculation of effect on calibration

To calculate the effect of the, above described, manufacturing variations on the calibration of the calorimeter, we will now combine the measured manufacturing variations with the formula in table 1. This gives table 15 below. Discussion of the details of the application of the measured manufacturing variations to the formula in table 1 is given in the next paragraphs.

To calculate the effect of the copper variation we take the fractional variation of the copper thickness for the readout volume from the last line of table 3.

For the fractional displacement of the argon by the honeycomb we assume that the all the honeycomb in a readout volume came from sequential cuts from the same honeycomb block. While this is not always the case this is a conservative assumption. Hence the variation is just the variation in the displacement of a single honeycomb sheet, which we take from the final line of table 9.

For the variation of the 8.5mm copper-to-copper gap, we use the fractional variation given in the last line of table 14.

For the variation in the four sub-gaps, sets of randomly generated sub-gaps were produced in a toy Monte Carlo. The largest gap was assumed to have the additional size and variation given in table13. Conservatively it was assumed all the variation went into a single gap that is then larger than the other 3 gaps. The other 3 gaps were assumed to all have the same size. The non-operational sub-gap was chosen randomly from the four sub-gaps. These randomly generated gaps, with 3 of their 4 sub-gaps operational, were then analysed to give the anticipated signal variation using equation 8. Of course in this situation the signal is reduced by a factor \(\nicefrac{{3}}{{4}}\) due to the missing HV, and hence signal, in one of the gaps. That this causes a \(\nicefrac{{1}}{{4}}\) drop in the signal has been confirmed in test beam measurements.

The estimated total variation in the non-electronics calibration coefficient due to measured variations in manufacture discussed above is (see table 15 below) in the 0.25-0.32% range. It is dominated by two factors: the honeycomb argon displacement variation and the variation in the gap between the copper plates.

When making a list of effects, it is natural to be concerned by what effects we might not have included. Other non-measured effects are difficult to imagine. The only obvious effect is the degree of fluffiness of the cut honeycomb, this might decrease the signal by interrupting the flow of current across the argon gap, but we estimate this to be a small fraction (\(<\)1/4) of the honeycomb density variation.

## Factors that will affect the alignment precision

The variation in height of the modules and wheel misalignments, in as much as they affect the position of the readout electrodes

The position of the readout PAD boards in ATLAS will be determined by the position of the cryostat in ATLAS, the position of the wheel within the cryostat, the position of the modules within that wheel, and the position of the boards within that module. The first two of these parameters cannot be estimated at this time, and anyway will be set by 6 global numbers. For instance it might be chosen to use: 3 positions (x,y,z) and a rotation about each of these 3 axis. Here we will discuss the variance within the wheel of the module position and the variance of the boards within the module from nominal.

**z variation**

This arises from the non-flatness of the front face of the wheel, the variation of build up in tolerances within each module, and the variation of the honeycomb thickness (giving rise to a variation in the gap of the central readout board). The non-flatness of the wheel can be extracted from the wheel alignment measurements. It can be found on EDMS, Document No. ATL-AE-UR-0011 for HEC2C. Here is a precis provided by Roy Langstaff:

_The wheel has'sagged' to a similar value to that of the HEC1 C wheel. The Connection Bar located at the 12 o'clock position has moved downwards by 0.2mm, while the Connection Bar at the 6 o'clock position has moved downwards by 0.5mm. However, this was not the maximum downwards movement. Three Connection Bars located between the 4 and 5 o'clock positions (when looking at the FRONT of the wheel) have all moved down by 0.9mm and also outwards by 0.3mm to 0.8mm. This is a very similar occurrence to what happened to HEC1 C. The mean circle calculation shows this movement has had little effect on the overall shape of the wheel. The maximum excursion outside of the mean circle on the front face of the wheel is 0.4mm, and there has been a 0.7mm excursion inside the circle._

_The data determining the plane of the front face indicates there is a very slight leaning of the wheel, from top to bottom, of 0.6mm. This could indicate a lack of perpendicularity, of approx. 0.25mm, of the support rails when they were installed. In addition, a Connection Bar of dubious length tolerance was assembled between modules 15 and 16 (CB15). This has introduced an anomaly into the 'Z' dimension data. If this one value is ignored, the front face of the wheel is plane within 1.2mm. There is no evidence of the slight, side to side, concave shape, experienced on the first wheel._

_The mean circle calculation for the rear face of the wheel shows the maximum excursion outside of the circle to be 0.6mm and the greatest deviation inside ofthe circle is 0.4mm. Once again, ignoring the data for Connection Bar CB15, the rear face of the wheel is plain within 1.5mm._

Hence the front face is plane to 1.2mm and the rear face to 1.5mm. To be conservative we will use the larger of these two numbers, and to convert to RMS we will divide by \(\sqrt{12}\) giving 0.43mm. To estimate the variation in board position to this we must add in quadrature the variation in module height, and the variation in gap materials-spacer height difference (divided by the square root of 2 because we want the variation in position of the PAD board which is in the middle of the gap materials) giving:

**x, y variation**

This arises internally to the module from variation in the tolerance of the etching of the boards, variation of placement of the etched pattern within the board, and movement of the boards from their nominal positions. This final parameter contains a systematic effect: boards might drop under gravity in the wheel (if the honeycomb does not hold them tightly). We estimate, by discussions with those who made the boards, the RMS variation from all these effects of 0.7mm, with a possible fraction of the boards suffering from movement under gravity of 0.5mm. Whether the boards will suffer from movement under gravity, will depend on subsequent handling of the cryostat. In addition handling causing g forces in excess of 3g will likely change the shape of the copper structure of the wheel. To these variations we must add alignment of modules within the wheel. First we consider the non-circularity of the wheel:

_The maximum excursion outside of the mean circle on the front face of the wheel is 0.4mm, and there has been a 0.7mm excursion inside the circle._

To convert to an estimated RMS we take the total maximum variation: 1.1mm and divided by the square root of 12, giving 0.32mm. Next we consider the \(\varphi\) misalignments of the module that we estimate from variations in the inter-module gaps. The RMS of the inter-modules gap was found to be 0.50mm. To get the estimated total RMS variation we add these two module alignment estimates in quadrature to the internal module RMS variations discussed above:

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{l|r} RMS Flatness front face wheel (mm) & 0.43 \\ RMS module height (mm) & 0.15 \\ RMS gap materials-spacer height difference (mm) & 0.13 \\ \hline
**Total (mm)** & **0.48** \\ \end{tabular}

**Total (mm)** & **0.92** \\ \end{tabular}
\end{table}

## Conclusion for alignment

The estimate of the RMS alignment tolerances for the cells of the HEC relative to the absolute alignment of the HEC is difficult to estimate. However as a **starting point** for further studies with the beam in ATLAS it would be sensible to assume the alignment is **of the order**:

* 1.0mm in x, and y
* 0.5mm in z

**Factors that will affect the X-talk and cause a variation in signal with LHC luminosity**

**The variation in the resistivity of the carbon loaded kapton on the PAD and EST boards**

The resistivity of the carbon loaded kapton(CLK) was not directly measured as part of the Quality Control procedures. Rather for every board the resistance between the connection to the board at the outer radius to that of the connection near the inner radius was measured (the so called pin-to-pin resistance).

The relationship between pin-to-pin resistance and resistivity we measured empirically to be:

Resistivitity (warm) = Pin-to-Pin Resistance (warm) / 9.17

To use the measured resistance to make estimates of effects in the cold, the change in resistivity (or resistance) between room temperature (\(\sim\)20% effect) and humidity (\(\sim\)2% effect) and the liquid argon conditions must be allowed for (empirical factor from our measurements):

Resistivity Warm (20C at 30% humidity) = Resistivity Cold (80K at 0% humidity) x 1.19

The graph below histograms this resistance for all PAD boards. As can be seen the CLK resistance is a peak with a long high resistance tail. This tail tends to dominate the RMS.

**Figure 2: Variation in resistance of the PAD boards**The average warm pin-to-pin resistance of the various boards is:

The RMS variation in the above pin-to-pin resistances is:

To estimate the average voltage drop across the gap we must add the resistance of the HV plane and the GND plane that faces it. So for instance in the gap between the EST 1 HV and the copper in the 1-8 gap set, the total resistance is 10.4 M\(\Omega\), while in the adjacent EST/PAD gap the total resistance is 6.4+7.4 M\(\Omega\). To this we must add 0.5 M\(\Omega\) for the resistor at the connection of the HV plane to the HV line for that cell, and a further 0.8 M\(\Omega\), for the 0.1 M\(\Omega\) resistor at the HV distribution board for the related HV line (connecting 8 sub-gaps). See figure 5, near the end of this document, for a diagram of the location of these resistors.

### Loss of signal due to voltage drop in the resistors of the HV system

In order to discuss the affect of minimum bias events causing currents in the argon gap that create voltage drops in these resistances we will follow a simplified model. For minimum bias events, at high luminosity (\(\mathcal{L}=10^{34}\) cm\({}^{-2}\) sec\({}^{-1}\)), we will assume:

The dN/d\(\eta\) for minimum bias events (dN is the number of particles and d\(\eta\) is a range of \(\eta\) containing dN particles, on average) is constant over the HEC \(\eta\) coverage.

\(\bullet\) dN(charged)/d\(\eta\) d\(\varphi\)\(\sim\) 6.......... (11)

and

\(\bullet\)\(<\)E\({}_{\rm T}\)\(>\)\(\sim\) 0.6 GeV for each charged particle........... (12)

Table 18: The average resistance of CLK on the faces of the PAD and EST boardsWe will study the 1-8 readout segment which goes from \(\eta=1.5\) to 3.2 and each module has a d\(\varphi=0.2\). As:

\[\rm E=E_{T}/\sin\theta\]

\[\rm E_{total}=\int\ (<\!\!E_{T}\!\!>/\!\sin\ 0)\ dN\]

Substituting equation (12) into above gives:

\[\rm E_{total}=\ 0.6\int\ (1/\sin\ 0)\ dN\ \ \ \ \ GeV\]

Substituting equation (11) into above gives:

\[\rm E_{total}=\ 3.6\ d\varphi\ \int\ (1/\sin\ 0)\ d\eta\ \ \ \ (\ integrated\ over\ \eta=1.5\ to\ 3.2\ )\ \ \ \ GeV\]

Where:

\(\eta=\) -Log\({}_{\rm c}\)(tan \(\theta\)/2), and d\(\varphi=0.2\) (the \(\varphi\) width of the sheet of CLK over which the charge in an argon gap is collected).

Solve above two equations using Mathematica5\({}^{\tiny\mbox{\rm$\mbox{\rm$\mbox{\rm$\mbox{\rm$\mbox{\rm$\mbox{\rm$\mbox{\rm$ \mbox{\rm$\mbox{\rm$\mbox{\rm$\mbox{\rm$\mbox{\rm$\mbox{\rm$}}}$}}}}}}$}}}\) gives:

\[\rm E_{total}=0.73\ GeV\ per\ crossing\]

We assume half the energy is deposited in the 1-8 readout segment.

So the energy deposited in each 1.85 mm gap per second is:

(Number of crossings/second) x (sampling fraction) x (1/number of sub-gaps) x

(Average Energy Deposited).

(1/(25x10\({}^{-9}\))) x (0.01) x 1/4 x (0.73x10\({}^{9}\)) eV/sec

\(=7.3\) x 10\({}^{13}\) eV/sec

assuming 25.6 eV/ion pair we get:

2.8 x 10\({}^{12}\) ion pairs giving an average current of:

(2.8 x 10\({}^{12}\)) x (1.6x10\({}^{-19}\)) A

giving: 455 nA

Which is in reasonable agreement with value of 696 nA given by A. Kiryunin (using a more complex model), and compared in the table below to the power supply limit.

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:28]

It is worth noting this signal drop will be correctable, if the current in the power supplies is measured and the resistance of the boards known. However as this turns out to be a small affect, this correction will not be significant until the luminosity is close to design luminosity.

#### Conclusion for the Signal drop at high luminosity due to the CLK Resistivity

The variation of the CLK resistivity has a long tail so quoting an RMS is not very useful. However this effect is small and does not appear until high luminosity running starts. To give a starting point for studies at that time, or for helping discussions of consequences of the LHC exceeding design luminosity the following two tables might be useful. Please remember that in making these estimates the conservative assumption that one HV tab is broken is made. Also if this effect is to be corrected every point on the board has a different correction, the smallest correction being near the HV tab, and the largest correction being at the innermost radius at pseudo-rapidity \(\eta=3.2\) (where the pileup current is at a maximum).

#### Cross-talk between adjacent tiles in a PAD board

More important than the anticipated signal drop, perhaps, is the effect of the resistivity on the X-talk to the adjacent readout element. This will be present at all luminosities. Studies show this is dominated by the X-talk through the CLK on the PAD board. We will use the simple model that all the X-talk is through the CLK that lies directly above the gap between two readout tiles on a PAD board (see figure 3).

Resistivity is defined as the resistance measured between two contacts length \(d\) place distance \(d\) apart. So when we consider a typical readout tile of side 150 mm, gap to adjacent tile 2 mm, we model the CLK resistance path as 150/2 resistors in parallel each with a resistance equal to the resistivity (figure 3, shows the X-talk path if the length of the side of the tile \(L\) is just three times the inter-tile gap \(d\)). This is put in parallel with the resistance of the CLK on the other side of the board giving the total resistance connecting the two tiles on this readout board. This tile is then connected to another tile, as the tiles are read out in pairs, so this reduces the X-talk resistance by another factor of 2. The cross talk in this simple model is taken as the ratio between this total X-talk resistance and the input impedance to the amplifier of about 50 \(\Omega\) (for details of the amplifier see: Cold electronics for the liquid argon hadronic end-cap calorimeter of ATLAS, 8th International Conference on Calorimetry in High Energy Physics, Lisbon, Portugal, 13 - 19 Jun 1999 - pages 570-575 Ban, J; Brettel, H; Cwienk, W D; Fent, J; Kurchaninov, L L; Oberlack, H; Schacht, P; available at:

The results of this approach are given in tables 27 and 28 below.

This above analysis is a simple model use for clarity and ease of inserting the measured variations in resistivity. Results from a full analysis of the gap structure and amplifiers "Electrical Model" is given in at talk by L.

Test beam data, also described in this reference, show a typical X-talk at the 2% level between adjacent readout volumes in a module. A comparison between the simple model given in this paper and the more complete electrical model is given below in table 29 for two different CLK resistivities:

Clearly the simple model used in this paper over estimates the X-talk by about a factor of about one and a half, relative to the more complex electrical models.

## Pile-up

Here we will discuss the anticipated affect of minimum bias events causing ion build-up in the liquid argon gaps, as this was not discussed in the TDR. The effect of minimum bias events causing currents in the resistive coatings, and thus creating a voltage drop has already been discussed above. An excellent review of the effect of pile-up is given in NIM article by J. Rutherfoord ( _Signal degradation due to charge buildup in noble liquid ionization calorimeters_, { Nuclear Instruments and Methods} {A482}, 156-178 (2002).J. Rutherfoord). The serious reader should consult this paper. Here we will give a short precis.

As the current rises in the gap the slow moving ions start to create an electric field that distorts the applied field. This effect is shown below as a function of a rate factor r (the figure is reproduced from the Rutherford NIM article). The applicable rate factor for the HEC depends on the \(\eta\) of measurement, the applied electric field, the ion mobility, and the LHC luminosity.

With r bigger than unity it is assumed the detector is seriously disabled.

The measurement of the positive ion mobility in liquid argon ranges from 0.02 to 1.0 mm\({}^{2}\)/V/s. Surely some of the measurements are very wrong. The most impressive measurement of 0.2 mm\({}^{2}\)/V/s is by Freeman et al. from Alberta. To be conservative we use the value of 0.06 mm\({}^{2}\)/V/s. Given below is a graph of anticipated cut-off due to ion build-up as a function of \(\eta\) (the figure is from the Rutherford NIM article, with estimated corrections for the distance to the interaction point and shower density in the HEC as proposed by J. Rutherfoord (Private Communication)). It can be seen that as the EMEC is closer to the interaction point, has a higher shower density, and similar pseudo-rapidity range, argon gap and voltage to the HEC, it suffers from ion mobility problems at a lower luminosity than the HEC. So these estimates indicate that degradation will happen first at the highest pseudo-rapidity regions of the FCAL (\(\eta\) in the range 4.8 to 5.0), then to the \(\eta\)=3.2 region of the EMEC, and finally to the high \(\eta\) regions of the HEC. The exact luminosity at which this will happen is not known due to the poor knowledge of the argon ion mobility. Clearly a better knowledge of the argon ion mobility would be

most useful in planning for dealing with the high luminosity degradation of the end cap calorimeter system.

The top (green) line refers to the case for the first readout depth of the EMEC (2mm at 2000V), the middle line for the HEC (2mm at 2000V) and the bottom line refers to the case for the FCAL1 (0.25mm at 250V). The lines only extend to the maximum pseudo-rapidity coverage of each detector.

**Failure Modes**

The major anticipated possible failure modes are:

1. HV failure of a readout section of a module: - Loss of \({}^{1}\!/4\) of signal all readout volumes in that readout depth of that module
2. HV failure of a gap of a module: - Loss of \({}^{1}\!/4\) x 1/8\({}^{\text{th}}\) of signal all readout volumes in that readout depth of that module
3. Loss of tile due to loss of electrical connection such as a crack in tab on a PAD board: - Loss of 1/8\({}^{\text{th}}\) of signal of that readout volume

All other anticipated effects will be measured by electronic calibration.

We propose using a Quality Factor for each cell that combines the effect of these failure modes on any one readout volume, along with the small effects of manufacturing variations between modules. It is the product of:

* Module Readout Section (Factors 1 and 2 above)
* Readout Volume (Factor 3 above)
* Electronic Calibration (From Electronic Calibration)
* Manufacturing tolerance factor (As discussed in the first section of this note)

This factor would be slightly different for each type of particle being detected: hadron, muon, and electromagnetic.

These effects will perhaps be most transparently seem in the muon data, where the consequence of a failure is the loss of a known fraction of the signal. For the 40 gaps of the HEC the signal to noise for muons is measured to be about 5:1 in test beam data. While this number is lower than anticipated in ATLAS, because the test beam was a non-pointing geometry, using this number gives a conservative estimate. The HEC has a total of 40 gaps or 160 sub gaps. Loss of a sub-gap (the smallest signal change failure), thus decreases the signal by 1/160. The error on the mean is given by:

\(\sigma\)/\(\surd\)(2N)

\(\sigma\)/S =1/5

so to see a decrease of 1/160 in the signal S would require:

2N = (160/5)N = 3200

Hence, very approximately, about 3200 isolated muons are required to pass through a volume before the loss of a sub-gap becomes statistically distinguishable from the noise. With a cosmic ray rate of \(\sim\)2000/sec (see:

bottom left graph) then we have about 1000/sec into each endcap. There are

approximately 1000 readout volumes (of a depth of 40 gaps) per endcap. So the rate is of order 1 muon per second per readout tower. So initial indications of bad gaps should be

available easily within a few days of cosmic ray data.

## Changes since TDR

### Decision to use carbon loaded Kapton\({}^{\circledR}\):

In the TDR two options for the resistive coatings on the readout boards were considered, a carbon loaded paint, and carbon loaded Kapton\({}^{\circledR}\) (CLK). Due to the superior ability to make a robust HV electrical connection to the carbon loaded Kapton\({}^{\circledR}\) in the limited space available, the CLK option was chosen even though it was more expensive. The parameters of the CLK design used are as discussed in the TDR.

### Decision to have two sites with slightly different EST's:

Due to time constraints two manufacturing sites were used to make EST's. These used different glues, resulting in slightly different board thickness (as discussed in the manufacturing variations section of this paper) but were otherwise identical.

### Decision not to use a crane during operations in B180:

Concerns of the risk factors of using cranes with heavy loads, the possibility of introducing high accelerations during placing heavy loads on stands, and problems with maintaining cleanliness during craning operations caused us to chose the option of not using a crane for any HEC wheel operations. All operations were with rotators and air pads.

### ST6A storage cradle:

To enable the HEC group to continue wheel manufacture during times when T6 (the cradle in front of the cryostat) was full, or not available, a second standalone cradle suitable for storing 2 HEC wheels was manufactured. This device was for wheel storage during the assembly of the 4 HEC wheels. This device had no effect on the final operational characteristics of the HEC calorimeter, and was built for end cap assembly scheduling reasons only.

### Detailed decision on the placement of resistors in the HV distribution system detector:

The HEC detector from the viewpoint of the HV system is a set of ionisation chambers (sub-gaps) with various capacitances (typically 100 nF ) per chamber sub-gap. The HEC has 1024 channels in total (1/2 EndCap A, 1/2 Endcap C ). The applied HV is floating and positive, having a value settable between 0 and 2.5 kV (V\({}_{\mathrm{max}}\)= 2.5kV) with 1.8 kV being the nominal design voltage. The nominal voltage is designed to be decreased by 100 or 200 Volts if a chamber is not stable at 1.8 kV, and in addition the voltage may be switched off if a chamber is not stable. Design voltage stability \(<\) 1V at 1.8kV (that is one part in 5x10\({}^{-4}\) at V\({}_{\mathrm{max}}\)). The leakage currents are anticipated to be in the range 20 nA to 200 nA.

The HEC internal cabling from the HEC gaps to the feedthrough (see figure 5 below) has the following characteristics:

* One HV-line connects to one of: \(\circ\) 8 sub-gaps of the 1-8 gaps \(\circ\) 16 sub-gaps of the 9-24 gaps \(\circ\) 8 sub-gaps of the 25-32 gaps \(\circ\) 8 sub-gaps of the 33-40 gaps
* Each HV-line connects via a resistor of about 4 M\(\Omega\) (approximately 3.5 M\(\Omega\) from the carbon loaded Kapton(r) (see table 18, and make allowance for the fact the HV connects to the carbon loaded Kapton(r) at 2 locations) and exactly 0.5 M\(\Omega\) from a discrete resistor mounted on the strip-line on the side of the HEC module) at each sub-gap.
* Each HV line (HABIA cable) connects at the backend of the HEC detector to the pigtail connector (4-fold, 8-fold) via one additional 0.1 M\(\Omega\) resistor
* The HV pigtails on an 8 line AXON cable enter the cold side of the feedthrough on 64 connectors (total 8 x 4 per EndCap)
* The feedthrough (type STONY BROOK) on the warm side converts within a patch box to a (4 x 7 x 32-pin) connector and connects to the external connector via a 5 k\(\Omega\) / 27 nF / 200 k\(\Omega\) filter.

#### Decision to split the readout of the rear-wheel into two regions

In the TDR the HEC is described with just three readout depths. During the detailed design stage it was realized that adding an additional depth to the readout came without cost inside the cryostat. That is the number of amplifiers remained the same, because of the design of the PSB the summing stages were present, and the signal feedthroughs were available on the HEC feedthrough. Given this provide better signal to noise for muons at high luminosity, more redundancy against failure modes, and can only serve to improve performance, the decision was made to split the rear wheel readout into two equal depths. So the as built readout depths are:

* Depth 1: Gaps 1-8
* Depth 2: Gaps 9-24
* Depth 3: Gaps 25-32
* Depth 4: Gaps 33-40

#### Conclusions

The design changes and choices since the LARG TDR was written are minor.

The study of the actual HEC module manufacturing variations has indicated anticipated inter-module relative calibration constants at the 0.3% level will be required. This is within the original design expectations, and is consistent with the non-observation of such effects in the HEC beam test data. Alignment of the readout volumes within the HEC wheels is at the 1mm level.

Considerable experience of beam test measurements of HEC modules has not shown any major un-anticipated failure modes. The anticipated known failure modes are minor in nature. A proposal for correcting for these failure modes in operation has been made.

Cross-talk between adjacent readout volumes has been observed in the test beam at the 1-2% level. Significant variations in cross talk at the 30-50% of the average value are anticipated, due to variations in the resistivity of the CLK.

At high luminosity (\(\mathcal{L}=10^{34}\) cm\({}^{\text{-2}}\) sec\({}^{\text{-1}}\)) some minor loss in signal due to voltage drop over the surface of the CLK and resistors in the HV distribution system is anticipated. However of considerable more importance is that at high luminosity the high \(\eta\) portions of the HEC come close to suffering serious deterioration due to positive ion buildup. The level of deterioration is difficult to assess due to the lack of knowledge of the positive ion mobility. It would be very useful to make measurements of the positive argon ion mobility in regimes similar to those we will see in ATLAS during LHC operation.
