**Abstract**

This note describes the properties of jets from light quarks (\(u\), \(d\), \(s\) and \(c\)) in \(t\bar{t}\) events, with the goal of obtaining a good reconstruction of the hadronically decaying W-boson, which will be used for an in-situ jet energy scale measurement and will enter, together with jets from \(b\) quarks, into the top quark reconstruction.

Introduction

The measurement of the top quark mass with a precision of 1 GeV is one of the goals of the LHC experiments. In order to achieve such a precision, several complementary methods can be used [1]. The most straightforward method, namely the measurement of the tri-jet invariant mass from the hadronically decaying top quark in the \(t\bar{t}\to l\nu b\)\(qqb\) channel, can in principle reach such a precision, provided that the three jets are well reconstructed and calibrated.

This note describes some studies of the reconstruction and calibration of jets from light quarks (\(u\), \(d\), \(s\) and \(c\)) in \(t\bar{t}\) events, with the goal of obtaining the best possible reconstruction of the hadronically decaying W-boson. After a comparison of various jet algorithms, two methods of in-situ jet calibration using the W-boson mass distribution will be presented. Finally, the stability of the W-boson reconstruction with different gluon radiation settings in the Monte Carlo event generator will be shown.

Unless otherwise specified, the studies presented here have been performed using \(t\bar{t}\) events generated with MC@NLO + Herwig, with the top quark mass equal to 175 GeV, at least one of the W-bosons decaying leptonically, and a full GEANT simulation of the ATLAS detector. The simulation statistics corresponds to a luminosity of about 0.9 fb\({}^{-1}\). By default, no pile-up is included in the simulation, except in a few dedicated studies. Triggering was not considered, as \(t\bar{t}\to l\nu b\)\(qqb\) events will be triggered mainly by the leptonic decay of the second top quark, without biasing the jets on the hadronic side.

## 2 A comparison of jet reconstruction algorithms

The current default jet algorithm used for \(t\bar{t}\) event reconstruction in ATLAS is the cone algorithm with a size \(\Delta R\) = 0.4. A small cone size was indeed found in previous studies to give the best mass resolution and signal over background ratio. This section presents new studies of the optimal jet algorithm, performed by looking at the jet energy, angular resolutions and at the W-boson mass reconstruction. For these studies, the cone and \(\rm k_{T}\) algorithms, with various parameters, were tried. Details on jet algorithms can be found in Ref. [2].

Cone algorithms define jets as the combination of input objects from generated stable particles or calorimeter energy deposits within a cone of radius R around the jet directions \(\eta\) and \(\phi\). In an iterative procedure, the jets are repeatedly reconstructed until a stable configuration is found. Two different implementations exist: the first one, referred to as seeded cone jet finder, used in this paper, uses high \(E_{T}\) objects in the event as a starting point, whereas the second, seed-less implementation, is much slower but theoretically more accurate. In both scenarios, the jets obtained undergo a split-merge procedure, to define non-overlapping exclusive jets. The resulting jets then need to be calibrated as explained below.

The second class of jet algorithms consists of the \(\rm k_{T}\) algorithm, which reconstructs jets via a clustering procedure. Such jets do not necessarily have a cone-shape with a fixed radius. Instead, the algorithm clusters "nearest" protojets together, depending on their relative transverse momentum. Thus, it also ensures a unique association of input clusters to jets, without the need for split/merge procedures as in cone algorithms.

The \(\rm k_{T}\) algorithm introduces a distance measurement \(\Delta R\) and a recombination scheme [3]. The distance measurement decides which pair of protojets should be merged and when to stop merging a protojet any further. Deciding whether to merge the two closest jets or flagging one of the protojets as a final jet is executed recursively in the algorithm, until there are no more mergeable protojets left. The recombination scheme determines how to combine two protojets into a new protojets. Here we use the E recombination scheme.

There are two modes of operation for the \(\rm k_{T}\) algorithm, the inclusive and exclusive mode. The inclusive \(\rm k_{T}\) algorithm is intended for defining inclusive jet cross sections, as they are typically used in hadron-hadron interactions. It has a parameter R, which controls the decision to merge protojets or declare them as final jets, and plays a role comparable to the cone size in cone jet algorithms.

The \(\mathrm{k_{T}}\) algorithm in its exclusive mode must account for the proton remnants and the underlying event in the p-p interaction for the calculation of exclusive cross sections. Its parameter \(\mathrm{D_{cut}}\) controls the scale which separates "beam jets" from the "hard jets" during the clustering. Moreover, the value of \(\mathrm{D_{cut}}\) can also be determined dynamically if one fixes the desired number N of final jets.

The basic input objects for both cone and \(\mathrm{k_{T}}\) jet algorithms are either calorimeter towers, defined as a group of cells in a fixed (\(\Delta\eta\), \(\Delta\phi\)) grid, or topological clusters, defined as a group of cells formed around a seed cell [4]. These calorimeter towers or topological clusters are given at the electromagnetic scale. The jets obtained are then calibrated to the hadronic scale using different weighting schemes such as the H1-style [5], whose major drawback is that the set of corrections is specific for each type of jet finder and each value of its parameters.

The comparisons of jet algorithms were performed on \(t\bar{t}\to l\nu b\,jjb\) events. In order to consider only jets relevant for the top quark mass measurement, an event selection was performed, requiring:

* a missing transverse energy \(>20\,\mathrm{GeV}\) to account for the unmeasured neutrino.
* one isolated electron or muon, defined as described in [6], with \(p_{T}>20\,\mathrm{GeV}\) and \(|\eta|<\)2.5.
* at least 3 jets with \(p_{T}>40\,\mathrm{GeV}\), a \(4^{th}\) jet with \(p_{T}>20\) GeV, with \(|\eta|<2.5\).

### Jet energy resolution and linearity

This section presents the energy and position measurement performance for various jet algorithms, calibrated with the H1 weighting scheme. Although we investigated, in this section, all the combinations of cone / inclusive \(\mathrm{k_{T}}\) algorithm, 2 jets sizes, made from towers / topological clusters, with / without pile-up, for the sake of clarity not all results are shown in the figures.

In the events passing the event selection cuts, the jets considered for the resolution studies are the two jets closest to the two quarks from the W-boson decaying hadronically, when their distance \(\Delta R\) to the quark is less than 0.3. As the final goal is to improve the two jet invariant mass reconstruction, the jet energies (and directions) are hereafter compared directly to the ones of the associated quarks.

Figure 1 shows, for four jet algorithms, the distributions of the energy difference between the matched quark and jet, divided by the quark energy, for two different jet energy ranges. Larger jets lead, especially at low energies, to a worse resolution and to larger tails because the jet energies are overestimated when they overlap with other particles in the underlying event.

These energy distributions were fitted with a Gaussian distribution 2). The width of the distribution, as a function of the energy, is shown on figure 2 and in Table 1. The resolutions obtained here are significantly worse than the detector resolution itself, as shown in Ref. [5], mainly because they include the fluctuations of the energy lost outside the jets, as relevant to determine the best algorithm for the W-boson (and the top quark) mass reconstruction. To quantify this effect, Figure 3 compares these resolutions to the ones obtained by using the jets made from the Monte Carlo hadrons ("Truthjets"). The latter ones are typically 20% better, and comparable to the resolutions shown in [5].

Footnote 2): To make the fit stable, a first Gaussian was fitted between the mean of the histogram \(\pm\) 2 times the RMS. A second fit was then performed in the same way using the mean and width of the first fit.

Jet energy resolutions were also studied with events including the pile-up expected at a luminosity of \(10^{33}\)\(\mathrm{cm^{-2}s^{-1}}\) (figure 4 and Table 1), showing that:

* When jets are made from towers, small sizes are preferable, especially for the cone algorithm. For example, Figure 4 shows that the energy resolutions of cone 0.4 jets made from towers is degraded by 30% to 50% in presence of pile-up.

Figure 3: Comparison of the jet energy resolutions with respect to the Monte Carlo hadrons (“Monte Carlo jets”) and with respect to the initial quarks from the W-boson decay, for events simulated without pileup.

* The algorithms using topological clusters seem to behave very well, even in the presence of pile-up, as can also be seen on this figure.

For cone 0.4 algorithms, the reconstructed jet energy is on average 4% lower than the quark energy, for quarks with transverse momenta above 40 GeV. This 4% miscalibration can _a priori_ come from the detector calibration itself, from the energy lost outside the jet, or from the underlying event. Figure 5 shows that, in the current simulation, the detector is very well calibrated, to a precision better than 3% for all algorithms, and to better than 1% for the cone 0.4 algorithm.

On the other hand, Figure 6 shows that the out-of-cone energy is important, and accounts for the 4% energy shift observed with cone 0.4.

The difference between the quark and the reconstructed jet energies, for quark energies between 15 and 50 GeV, is shown in Figure 7 with and without pileup, for the cone 0.4 from topological clusters algorithm. For such a small jet size and a topological cluster noise suppression, the average energy is shifted by 2.5 %.

### Jet angular resolution

Figure 8 shows, for four jet algorithms, the distributions of the distance \(\Delta R\) between the quark and the matched jet, for the lowest and the highest energy bins. It can be seen that smaller jets have a more precise direction determination. This can also be seen from Figure 9 where the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of these distributions are plotted. It was checked that, as for the energy resolution, the same conclusion remains when pile-up is added, and that jets made from topological clusters are less sensitive to pile-up.

It is observed that, for large cone sizes and large transverse momenta, the distributions of the distance between the quark and the matched jet have larger tails (larger fraction of jets with a distance to the

### W-boson mass reconstruction

This section compares the W-boson mass reconstruction performances for the cone algorithms with sizes 0.4 and 0.7 and for the \(\mathrm{k_{T}}\) jet algorithms with different choices of parameters, both using topological clusters.

The choice of the jet algorithm parameters is crucial for the performance of the W-boson reconstruction. Indeed, the probability, averaged over the W-bosons selected in this section, for the two quarks from the W-boson decay to be at a distance \(\Delta R\) smaller than 1.4 is 25%, leading to non-negligible overlap effects for jet sizes of the order of 0.7, as already seen in section 2.1, and eventually to the merging of the two jets coming from the light quarks into a single one. On the contrary, the probability for the 2 quarks from the W-boson decay to be at a distance smaller than 0.8 is only 4%.

The same event selection as the one described in section 2.1 is performed, apart for the requirement that the fourth jet satisfies \(p_{T}>40\) GeV, which is needed to improve the W-boson purity. On the selected events, the three jets whose four-momentum sum has the highest \(\mathrm{p}_{T}\) are chosen to belong to the hadronic top quark. Among these three jets, the di-jet combination whose mass is closest to the known value of the W-boson mass (80.4 GeV) is taken to represent the W-boson. The remaining third jet is assumed to be the \(b\) quark; no further b-tagging information is used in this study. The distribution for the reconstructed W-boson mass is shown in Figure 10.

To obtain mass values from the invariant mass spectra of Figure 10, the sum of a Gaussian and a \(4^{th}\) degree Chebychev polynomial is fitted to the distribution. The polynomial describes the background from wrong jet combinations and from background events, whereas the mean value of the Gaussian and its error are interpreted as the mass (\(\mathrm{m_{W}}\)) and its statistical error, \(\sigma_{stat}\). The width of the Gaussian is referred to as \(\sigma_{Gauss}\). Table 2 shows the obtained W-boson mass with the E recombination scheme for various choices of the \(\mathrm{k_{T}}\) parameters.

The error resulting from 1% variation on the jet energy scale (JES) is obtained by varying the reconstructed jet energies by \(\pm\)1% followed by a linear fit across the three W-boson masses (-1%, nominal value, +1%).

With increasing R and D\({}_{\rm cut}\) parameter values, the reconstructed W-boson (and also top quark) mass rise monotonically. Higher parameter values lead to fewer but more energetic jets and thus their com

bination has a higher invariant mass. Part of this effect could in principle be absorbed by the in-situ calibration, but on the other hand, the event is more likely to be misreconstructed due to unwanted jet merging, which makes the choice of the three jets maximizing the \(\mathrm{p_{T}}\)-sum unpredictable.

The efficiencies quoted in Table 2, defined as the number of events in the gaussian part of the mass distribution divided by the initial number of events, which can be as high as 5.8%, drop to less than 4% when the jets become too big.

Table 2 also shows the purity of the W-boson reconstruction, defined as the fraction of events in the gaussian part of the distribution, in the range \([-1\sigma_{gaus},\ 1\sigma_{gaus}]\) from the mean value of the gaussian fit. A purity around 64% can be obtained with some choices of the algorithms / parameters, for example cone 0.4 or \(\mathrm{k_{T}}\) with \(\mathrm{R}=0.4\), whereas other choices may lead to purities about 15% smaller.

This study indicates that, for the W-boson mass reconstruction in \(t\bar{t}\) events, the cone 0.4 algorithm leads to the best performance both in terms of resolution and in terms of efficiency / purity.

Finally, in addition to this study which uses jets calibrated with H1-style weights, a study of the W-boson reconstruction using local hadron calibration, described in detail in [5] and in [7], has been started. Although the local hadron calibration algorithm is still being improved, the W-boson mass reconstruction capabilities are similar to the ones obtained with H1-weighted jets, both in terms of mass resolution and purity.

### Conclusion

The studies shown here indicate that a small jet size should be preferred for a proper reconstruction of the jets in \(t\bar{t}\) events, to avoid overlap effects spoiling the energy and angular resolutions and, eventually,

leading to the merging of jets. Thus, the cone 0.4 jet algorithm from towers used in the following sections and in most top physics studies is a good choice for looking for top events in the first LHC data, although it could be complemented by an algorithm using topological clusters, which seem to be robust against pileup. The effect of the pile-up on the W-boson mass reconstruction needs however to be assessed.

## 3 Measuring the light jet energy scale

### Introduction

The miscalibration of jet energies is one of the main sources of systematic error in the measurement of the top quark mass in the three-jet invariant mass method [1]. Indeed, a 1% error on the jet energy translates into a 0.9 GeV error on the top quark mass, 0.2 GeV coming from the light jet energy scale and 0.7 GeV from the b-jet energy scale. The goal of measuring the top quark mass with a precision of 1 GeV thus puts the limit on the miscalibration at 1% or better.

Several physics processes will be used in ATLAS to achieve such a precision [8]: di-jet events will help check the uniformity of the response as a function of rapidity; \(Z\)+jet and \(\gamma\)+jet events will be used to measure the energy scale as a function of energy. However, these processes cannot be applied directly to the jets in \(t\bar{t}\) events, for several reasons:

1. These processes contain a mixture of jets from light quarks, jets from \(b\) quarks and jets from gluons, with calibration factors probably different by a few % due to their different fragmentation and neutrino content
2. The underlying event may be different in \(t\bar{t}\) events
3. Jet selection performed to purify the \(t\bar{t}\) sample could lead to a different average jet energy scale in this sample

The use of \(W\to jj\) from the \(t\bar{t}\) events themselves (in-situ calibration) will thus be very important. After having shown how to select a clean \(W\to jj\) signal from \(t\bar{t}\) events, two possible methods for extracting the light jet energy scale will be presented. All the studies presented in this section (apart from the check of the stability with different top quark masses shown in section 3.6.3) use the default MC@NLO + HERWIG simulated events (with a top quark mass of 175 GeV), without pileup. The cone 0.4 jet algorithm from towers with the H1-style calibration is used for all studies in this section.

### Event and \(jj\) pair selection

In order to measure the jet energy scale with a precision of about 1%, a clean \(W\to jj\) sample must be selected. In this section the following selection cuts, which are stricter than the ones used previously, are thus used:

* One and only one isolated lepton (electron or muon) with \(P_{T}>20\) GeV
* Missing \(E_{T}>20\) GeV
* At least 4 jets with \(p_{T}>p_{T}^{cut}\)
* Among them, 2 and only 2 jets must be tagged as \(b\)-jets. The other jets are called "light jets" in the following.

In order to increase the purity, the W-boson candidate \(jj\) pairs are selected among all light jet pairs which lead to a reconstructed top quark mass between 150 and 200 GeV. In addition, one may want to consider only events with only two light jets.

The estimated number of \(jj\) pairs selected for 1 fb\({}^{-1}\) and the purity of the selection, defined as the fraction of \(jj\) pairs with both jets within \(\Delta R=0.25\) of the two W-boson quarks, are shown in table 3 as a function of \(p_{T}^{cut}\), and whether or not one uses only events with two light jets.

Requiring two light jets only reduces the number of \(jj\) pairs by about a factor of almost two, but is necessary if one aims to measure the jet energy scale down to 20 GeV, in order to minimize the bias due to the combinatorial background.

Figure 11 shows the \(jj\) mass distribution for \(p_{T}^{cut}=40\) GeV and exactly two light jets. The combinatorial background (shown in grey) is almost flat. The systematic error due to the knowledge of the combinatorial background will be discussed later. Because of the requirement for 2 b-tagged jets, the background from other processes is of the order of a few percent and is neglected here.

### The \(P_{t}\) cut effect in the Jet Energy Scale measurement

When measuring the jet energy scale, one must be aware of a shift introduced by any cut on the transverse momentum of the jets needed for the event selection. Indeed, when one selects jets with a reconstructed \(p_{T}\) greater than \(p_{T}^{cut}\), jets with a true \(p_{T}\) lower than the cut but a reconstructed one above are selected, whereas jets with a true \(p_{T}\) above the cut but a reconstructed one below are lost. These two effects lead to a ratio (reconstructed energy) / (true energy) higher than one near the cut, even if the calibration is perfect.

This can easily be seen, and the size of the effect measured, with a simple Monte Carlo simulation where the momenta of the quarks from the \(W\) boson decays in \(t\bar{t}\) are smeared according to the expected jet resolution 3), and a \(p_{T}\) cut on the smeared quark momenta is applied.

Footnote 3): The value \(\sigma(E)\ =\ 3.8\ \mathrm{GeV}+0.063\times\mathrm{E_{q}}\) was used.

Figure 12 shows the apparent calibration as a function of the jet \(p_{T}\) cut, using this simple simulation. This apparent calibration is greater for jets whose energy is closer to the value of the \(p_{T}\) cut. The size of the effect is fully determined once the \(p\), \(p_{T}\) spectra and the detector resolution are known. With the expected resolution of the ATLAS calorimeter, the global apparent calibration is 2% for a \(p_{T}\) cut = 40 GeV.

The shift in the energy scale also leads to a shift on the reconstructed \(W\) boson and top quark masses, which are shown in Figures 13 and 14. With a \(p_{T}^{cut}\) at 40 GeV, the bias on the \(W\) boson mass is about \(1.5\ \pm\ 0.6\) GeV, whereas the bias on the top quark mass is about \(2.0\ \pm\ 0.4\) GeV.

The two jet energy scale determination methods described below handle this effect in a different way:

* The iterative method measures the effective jet energy scale above the \(p_{T}^{cut}\), which will not reflect the bare jet energy scale, but will lead to \(W\) boson and top quark masses with the correct values.

* The template method aims at finding the bare jet energy scale (which was by definition 1 in the simple Monte Carlo simulation). The reconstructed \(W\) boson and top quark masses will then be shifted, and must be corrected.

### Expected Jet Energy Scale

The energy scales fitted by the two methods described below will be compared with the true jet energy scale, obtained by comparing the reconstructed jet energy and the quark energy.

In the simulation version used for this note, the mean value of the ratio of jet to quark energies, when the two jets chosen to form the hadronic W-boson are at \(\Delta R\,<\,0.25\) from the two quarks from the W-boson, for quarks with \(P_{T}\,>\,40\) GeV is \(0.961\pm 0.003\), as can be seen in figure 15.

As shown in section 2.1, this 4% miscalibration is mainly due to the out-of-cone energy.

### The iterative rescaling method

#### 3.5.1 Method

This method uses the precisely known W-boson mass as a reference to extract the light jet energy scale. The invariant mass of the two jets with energies \(E_{1}\) and \(E_{2}\) and an opening angle \(\theta_{jj}\), originating from the W-boson can be written as :

\[M_{jj}=\sqrt{2E_{1}E_{2}(1-\cos(\theta_{jj}))}\]

Figure 16 shows that the angle between the two jets is measured without any significant bias for most jet-jet pairs. Any deviation of \(M_{jj}\) therefore comes mainly from the energy miscalibration.

The peak value of this invariant mass matches the PDG W-boson mass value if the appropriate jet energy scale factors \(K(E_{1})\) and \(K(E_{2})\) are used:

Figure 15: \(E_{jet}/E_{quark}\) for jets originating from a W-boson and with \(p_{T}(quark)>40\) GeV.

\[M_{W}^{PDG}=\sqrt{2(K(E_{1})E_{1})(K(E_{2})E_{2})\times(1-\cos(\theta_{jj}))}=\sqrt{ K(E_{1})K(E_{2})}M_{jj}\]

If the jet calibration is independent of the energy (\(K=K(E_{1})=K(E_{2})\)), the jet energy scale factor \(K\) is simply \(K=M_{W}^{PDG}/M_{jj}\). The simple rescaling gives the effective jet energy scale, taking into account the \(p_{T}\) cut effect from the jet selection.

With 1 fb\({}^{-1}\) of luminosity, around 4000 jets originating from the W in the \(t\bar{t}\) sample are available for calibration. Normalizing the sample to 1 fb\({}^{-1}\), the truth calibration, for jets with \(P_{T}~{}>~{}40\) GeV, is \(K_{truth}=(E_{jet}/E_{parton})^{-1}=1.014\pm 0.002\). The value obtained by the simple rescaling of jet pairs originating from a W boson (no background contribution) is \(K=M_{W}^{PDG}/M_{jj}=1.014\pm 0.003\). The 1% goal on the precision on the global jet energy scale is therefore obtainable with 1 fb\({}^{-1}\), provided the luminosity dependence is small or can be corrected for.

Since the calibration is not constant over the energy and pseudorapidity, and since the two jets from the W-boson decay have in general different energies, the rescaling method has to be adapted to get the calibration K(var) (var=jet energy, jet pseudorapidity or any other jet variable). Instead of building one jj mass distribution, the first step is to split the studied jet variable in N bins, and to build all associated jj invariant mass distributions. In such a way, the distributions become correlated to the studied variable.

It can be shown that, if the rescaling method is iterated M times, extracting at each iteration j the correction factor for the bin i (\(K_{i}^{j}\)) and recomputing the invariant mass by adding the new \(K_{i}^{j}\) for the next iteration, the exact correction \(K_{i}\) per bin i can be obtained (thus the function K(var)):

\[K_{i}=\prod_{j=1,M}K_{i}^{j} \tag{1}\]This method converges in 3-4 iterations, and is stopped when the maximum difference between \(K^{j}\) and \(K^{j-1}\) is less than 1%. The number of bins N depends on the available jet statistics.

#### 3.5.2 Results

The simple rescaling method allows to determine a global jet energy scale factor. A W-boson mass value \(M_{W}=79.12\pm 0.25\) GeV is obtained from a fit with a polynomial+gaussian function to the jet-jet invariant mass spectrum. The resulting jet energy scale factor is thus \(K=M_{W}^{PDG}/M_{jj}=1.016\pm 0.003\)4). This value is very close to the one obtained previously by a fit on the same sample without combinatorial background included.

Footnote 4: The W boson mass is set to \(M_{W}=80.4\) GeV in the simulation.

Figures 17 and 18 show the effective calibration to be applied on the selected jets after the \(t\bar{t}\) selection for 10 fb\({}^{-1}\) of integrated luminosity 5). The observed discrepancy between the fit result and the truth \(K\) factors is due to the (\(\eta\), E) correlations existing on the jet energy scale factors. This is particularly true for high jet \(\eta\) and high jet energy. The discrepancy at low energy is a threshold effect which could be removed by lowering the \(p_{T}cut\) on the jets to 30 GeV when measuring the jet energy scale above 40 GeV. Nevertheless the jet energy scale as a function of \(\eta\) and E can be extracted with a precision of the order of 1%, without any a priori knowledge of the function shape before the fit. The treatment of the correlation could be resolved by a fit on W mass distributions defined as a function of both jet \(\eta\) and E.

Footnote 5: The calibration factors are large in the barrel-endcap transition region. In principle this dependence is corrected at the level of jet reconstruction algorithm using a \(p_{T}\) balance method in di-jet events. This correction has not been applied on the used sample.

For 1 fb\({}^{-1}\) of integrated luminosity, the number of available jets (\(\approx 4000\)) limits the number of bins and therefore the accuracy of the extracted jet energy scale functions (\(K(\eta)\) and K(E) ). The resulting plots for 1 fb\({}^{-1}\) are shown in Figures 19 and 20. A precision better than 2% is obtained in each energy or \(\eta\) bin.

#### 3.5.3 Systematic uncertainties

The systematic uncertainties associated to each point are of three types:

* the first is related to the method itself. Performing the fit on a large sample shows up to 1% deviation, due to the (\(\eta\),E) correlations on the jet energy scale which are not taken into account yet.
* the second is related to the impact of the background on the mass peak measurements. It is rather low since the W-boson sample has a purity above 80%. Further purification cuts can be applied to increase the purity. The associated error depends on the available statistics and is higher for low jet energy where the background contribution is higher. It should be noticed that the jet pairs contributing to the background are mainly composed of one jet originating from the W-boson, the others being jets coming from the remaining part of the event or gluon radiation. An event mixing technique, described in [1] paragraph 4.2, will be useful to assess the shape of the background contribution on real data. To evaluate the systematics induced by the background contribution, the background contribution was changed by +20%, separately for the FSR and non-FSR contributions 6). The fitted \(M_{W}\) values are all within 0.2 GeV, compatible with the statistical uncertainty leading to an uncertainty of \(0.003\pm 0.003\) for the global jet energy scale factor. Footnote 6: The shapes of the background when a jet coming from the W-boson decay is associated with a FSR or a non FSR jet are different. They are taken from a fast simulation Monte Carlo.
* the last comes from the correction factor to be applied on the fitted value to take into account the \(p_{T}\) bias discussed in section 3.3. This correction of the effect is fully determined once the jet p,spectra and energy resolution are known. The size of this correction is \(-1\%\) above 100 GeV and up to 2% at 40 GeV. In order to assess the error on these values, the resolution has been rescaled by \(\pm 10\%\), leading to variation less than one percent of the correction factors.

### The template method

#### 3.6.1 Method

The template method for the light jet energy scale determination is similar to the method described in [9] for the electromagnetic energy scale determination using \(Z^{0}\to e^{+}e^{-}\) events. It uses template histograms with various energy scales \(\alpha\) and relative (to the default jet energy resolution) energy resolutions \(\beta\). The \(\chi^{2}\) between each template histogram and the "data" is then computed. The minimum of the \(\chi^{2}\) is found in the (\(\alpha\), \(\beta\)) plane. With 1 fb\({}^{-1}\), this method fits both the average jet energy scale and a relative jet resolution. With enough data, it can be extended to measure these quantities as a function of the jet energy or rapidity.

The template histograms were generated from \(W\to qq\) decays in 1.2 million PYTHIA \(t\bar{t}\) events by smearing the quark energies by a gaussian number with width equal to \(3.8\;\mathrm{GeV}+0.063\times\mathrm{E_{q}}\), determined on reconstructed jets in an older simulation of \(t\bar{t}\) events. As will be shown later, the exact choice of the default energy resolution in the templates is not very important, as it will lead at the end only to a change in the fitted \(\beta\) and not in the fitted \(\alpha\). However, in order to obtain a \(\beta\) value close to 1, the jet angles are also smeared, according to the expected resolution, in the templates and the observed correlation

Figure 17: Result of the iterative rescaling fit as a function of \(E_{jet}\), with 10 fb\({}^{-1}\): the expected effective calibration factors are shown as square points, in addition to the fitted calibration factors with circles. The calibration factor obtained from Monte Carlo truth information \(K_{truth}(E)=(E_{parton}/E_{jet})\) are shown as square points while the calibration factor \(K(E_{i})\) obtained in the iterative rescaling procedure as described in section 3.5.1 are described with circles.

between the two jet energies is added by using correlated gaussian numbers for the energy smearing.

After smearing the quark energies, the same \(p_{T}^{cut}\) as used in the data is applied. This ensures that the fitted energy scale is not affected by the bias described in section 3.3. Figure 21 shows the reconstructed jet-jet mass (for events with two jets or more, with the combinatorial background included), the template histogram for \(\alpha=1\), \(\beta=1\) and the best fit histogram.

#### 3.6.2 Results

Table 4 summarizes the results obtained for jets with \(P_{T}~{}>~{}40\) GeV. The combinatorial background, which is flat as shown in Figure 11, doesn't affect the fitted jet energy scale (less than 0.6%), but degrades the fitted relative resolution by 30 to 40%. The choice to use or not events with more than two jets is also not changing the fitted jet energy scale.

Finally, these fitted energy scales are in good agreement with the expected value from the Monte-Carlo (\(0.961\pm 0.003\)), as obtained in section 3.4.

#### 3.6.3 Systematic uncertainties

Several checks of the stability of the method have been performed:

* The influence of the combinatorial background, and the choice of using or not events with more than two jets was already described in the previous section. All fitted energy scales are compatible within \(\pm\) 0.3 %.
* The stability with respect to the ingredients used in the templates was checked by generating template histograms without the smearing of the angles, or without the correlation between the jet

Figure 18: Result of the iterative rescaling fit as a function of \(\eta_{jet}\), with 10 fb\({}^{-1}\): the expected effective calibration factors are shown as square points, in addition to the fitted calibration factors with circles.

energies, or with a default jet resolution degraded by 20%. The fitted jet energy scales were found to be compatible within \(\pm\) 0.3%, and only the fitted relative resolutions were changing. This shows that the method is not very sensitive to the simulation used for the templates.
* The jet energy scales were fitted on \(t\bar{t}\) events simulated with various top masses but the same version of the simulation and reconstruction codes. The results are shown in Figure 22. All results are compatible within \(\pm\) 0.5%, even when including top masses in a very wide range.

#### 3.6.4 Stability of the template method with smaller integrated luminosities

In order to check the stability of the template method at lower luminosities, the 770 pb\({}^{-1}\) full dataset was split into sixteen parts, each part thus corresponding to 48 pb\({}^{-1}\). The fitted jet energy scales in the sixteen pseudo-experiments are shown in Figure 23. The average of the sixteen measurements is 0.9534, in good agreement with the fit on the full sample (\(0.9562\pm 0.0039\)). The RMS of the sixteen measurements is 1.9%, only slightly worse than the value expected by a scaling with the square root of the luminosity (1.6%). In addition, the average of the errors given by the fit is 1.5%, showing that this error is correctly estimated by the fit even at low luminosities.

### Conclusion on light jet energy scale

Two complementary methods for measuring the light jet energy scale from the \(W\to jj\) mass distribution in \(t\bar{t}\) events have been studied. The template method is well suited to measure the bare jet energy scale (integrated over some transverse momenta), with a precision which could be around 2% with 50 pb\({}^{-1}\)

Figure 19: Result of the iterative rescaling fit as a function of \(E_{jet}\), with 1 fb\({}^{-1}\): the expected effective calibration factors are shown as square points, in addition to the fitted calibration factors with circles.

Within the statistical precision of the available datasets, no systematic error larger than 0.5% has been identified. The required precision of 1% on the light jet energy scale should thus be achievable. The iterative method, on the other hand, is well suited to measure the jet energy scale of the selected jet sample, possibly as a function of the energy or as a function of rapidity.

In this study. the invariant mass of selected jet pairs present a clear W-boson signal on top of a flat background dominated by combinatorial from top events (Figure 11). This is possible because b jets are tagged with a high efficiency and purity. In the early data-taking phase, b-tagging may be less performant and the level of background will be much higher with contribution from QCD or W\(+\)jet events. The performance of the methods for calibration of the light jet energy scale in these conditions need to be evaluated.

The dependence of the jet energy scale with the level of pile-up has to still to be investigated, in order to decide whether a specific correction is needed.

## 4 W-boson mass reconstruction and gluon radiation

The stability of the W-boson reconstruction with different QCD-related jet activity, commonly referred to as initial- and final-state radiation (ISR and FSR) has been evaluated by using the standard herwig\(+\)mc@nlo simulation and the "low mass" and "high mass" acermc + pythia event samples described in [6].

### Reconstructed W-boson masses

The same event selection (described in the previous section) and mass reconstructions is applied on the 3 samples, with jets being reconstructed with the \(\Delta R=0.4\) cone algorithm from towers.

Figure 24 shows that the W-boson mass distributions for the 3 samples, normalized to the same number of events after selection, are clearly not compatible before calibration. The results of the mass peak fits are shown in Table 5. The difference between the high mass dataset and the low mass dataset is \(1.7\pm 0.2\) GeV.

The jet energy scales obtained with the template method described in section 3.6 are also shown in the table, together with the W-boson masses obtained after recalibrating the jet four-momenta. One observes that the calibrated W-boson masses are above the true W-boson mass because of the bias explained in section 3.3, but are all compatible within errors, showing that the calibration method is indeed working well.

### Light jet properties

Although the in-situ calibration leads to W-boson mass distributions which are independent of the gluon radiation level, we looked for additional measurable quantities which could help to understand these effects and tune the Monte Carlo simulations.

Figure 25 show the \(p_{T}\) distributions for the light jets coming from the W-boson decay 7. Only a very small difference, at low energies, is visible, which would probably be very difficult to measure in the data.

Footnote 7: A cut \(p_{T}>20\) GeV is applied in these figures

On the contrary, a very large difference is visible in the number of jets, as can be seen for example in the total number of jets with \(p_{T}>10\) GeV reconstructed in the events, shown in Figure 26. If the jet reconstruction efficiency is well understood, this distribution in the data could help to tune the

\begin{table}

Finally, no large difference has been seen in the \(p_{T}\) distributions for the jets not assigned to top quark decays, as shown in Figure 27.

## 5 Conclusions

This note has presented several aspects of the W-boson reconstruction in \(t\bar{t}\) events.

First, it was shown in section 2 that small jet sizes should be prefered to avoid overlap effects. The current default (cone algorithm with \(\Delta R=0.4\)) is well suited for the study of the first data, but could be complemented by a reconstruction using topological clusters, which seems robust in the presence of pileup.

Two methods for the in-situ calibration of the light jet energy scale have been studied (section 3). The two methods should be able to provide a light jet energy scale to the 1% level with 1 fb\({}^{-1}\), and could perhaps be used to follow the jet energy scale with time and/or luminosity. The two methods use complementary approaches and should be both applied in real data, up to the level of a top quark mass measurement, to allow for cross-checks.

A study of simulations performed with different gluon radiation settings (section 4) has demonstrated that, although the reconstructed W-boson mass can change by a large amount with different settings, the in-situ calibration method is able to correct for it.

More generally, the clean and large W-boson sample which should be available in \(t\bar{t}\) events will be a good laboratory to study the performance of jet reconstruction and calibration in real data, and compare them with the performance in Monte Carlo simulated events.

Figure 26: Total number of reconstructed jets with \(p_{T}>10\) GeV for datasets with different gluon radiation settings. The distributions are normalized to the number of events after selection in the standard simulation.

Most studies presented in this note were performed without including pile-up effects. The dependence of the results with luminosity should thus be checked. In addition, a scenario of not yet optimal detector performance, which would lead to higher backgrounds, should also be studied in order to understand the potential of the method for the early phase of data-taking.

Finally, in order to reconstruct properly the top quarks, the knowledge of the \(b\) jets will be of particular importance. For instance, the \(b\) jet energy scale is, in our simulation, about 5% lower than the light jet energy scale. This difference should be checked in the data to reach the ultimate precision for the top quark mass measurement.
