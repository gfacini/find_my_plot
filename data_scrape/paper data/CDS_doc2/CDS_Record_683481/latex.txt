###### Abstract

The convergency, converging speed and converging accuracy are studied for the ATLAS MDT system by using a Monte Carlo simulation method. Comparison is made for two configurations, one with 3 and another with 4 layers of drift tubes in a multilayer. This study is a continuation of an earlier study described in an earlier note. [1]

## Introduction

In the studies described in our earlier note, charged particles are generated by using ISAJET event generator and are propagated through the calorimeter and MDT system by using GEANT. All charged particles in the MDT are used in the autocalibration procedure.

We observed that the autocalibration does not converge around \(\theta=60^{\circ}\) for the densest packed tube arrangement with 3 or 4 layers of tubes in a multilayer without the magnetic field. This is true even when hits in two-multilayers are used. This is the so called \(30^{\circ}\) problem. When the magnetic field is turned on, the autocalibration converges at all \(\theta\) angles for both 3 and 4 layer tube layout. This is because most of charged tracks in the MDT have very low momenta and they are deflected away from the projective direction by the strong field.

Magnetic field plays important role in the convergency of the autocalibration process. Magnetic bending increases the angular spread of tracks. Without magnetic field, the angular spread of all charged particle tracks in the MDT system is \(\sigma=2.5^{\circ}\) which is mainly due to interactions in the ATLAS calorimeter.

In our previous studies, we only studied if the autocalibration converges or not. We did not attempt to address the speed of the converging process and the its accuracy. These are the subjects of this note.

## Some General Discussions

One of the factors affecting the achievable accuracy of autocalibration is the sagitta of tracks used. The saggita can be quite large for low momentum tracks within a multilayers across only a few tubes. At certain \(\theta\) angles, it may be necessary to use low momentum tracks to start the autocalibration process. We expect that in the real experiment, the autocalibration will be an iteration process. First, crude r-t relations will be obtained by using all tracks. Then the refinement can be made by using tracks with high momenta. As we can see from the studies described below, if the starting r-t relation is very close to the true r-t, the autocalibration is much easier to converge.

In the region where significant distortion of the isochrones is expected due to the large \(\phi\) component of magnetic field in the drift tubes, it is crucial to use the high momentum tracks to determine the r-t relation. If the isocrones have elliptical shapes, a two dimensional autocalibration may be required to determine complete r-t relation in a drift tube. This is of course extremely difficult to do in practice. In the final experiment, what we care about the most as far as the resolution is concerned are the high momentum muons originated from the interaction region. These muons are more of less projective andthey penetrate a drift tube in a definite direction with rather small angular spread. The r-t relation determined by using such kind of tracks can effectively reduce the two dimensional problem into a one dimensional problem and simple autocalibration procedure is sufficient.

As we all know, that the nonuniform magnetic field also affects the achievable accuracy of the autocalibration. This problem can be easy by carefully choosing the autocalibration area in which a single r-t relation is assumed. The sizes of these autocalibration areas are limited by the number of calibration constants which we can handle.

In theory we can select an array of tubes and perform autocalibration in these tubes. Each tube can have different r-t relation. The autocalibration can in principle converge to the r-t relations for individual tubes which can be compeltely different. We have shown in our previous study (reported in the September 1994 ATLAS Week) that this is indeed true. Three different r-t relation is assumed for the three layers of tubes in a multilayer. Starting from a linear r-t relation for the three layers of tubes, the three different r-t relations are correctly reached after the standard autocalibration procedure is performed. In the MDT system, we expect that only a very small fraction of tubes which are very close to a toroid coil need such special care during the autocalibration process. In most cases, we can assume that the r-t relation is the same in a relatively large area of chambers.

## The New Study

The study described in this note addresses the problem of speed and accuracy of the converging process. The effects of track angular spread are investigated. Although in a practical experiment, we would be satisfied with certain accuracy, it is still useful to see if an absolute converge can be reached for certain conditions and how fast (how many iterations) it can be reached.

In order to study the converging accuracy, we generate 100 GeV/c muon tracks pointing to the interaction region with certain angular spread. We assume that the TDC has an infinite precision. The MDT configuration is the densest layout with 3 or 4 layer tubes in a multilayer. Tracks are fitted by using hits only in one multilayer. The basic procedure of the autocalibration study is the same as described in the previous note. The 'true' r-t relation assumed is a smooth function. The shape of this assumed true r-t in the new study is slightly different from the assumed r-t in the old study. The autocalibration starts from a linear r-t relation. Fig. 1 shows the assumed true r-t function and it shows that a linear r-t is progressively converged to the true r-t in an iteration process. As will be discussed later, at some \(\theta\) angle the autocalibration does not converge if we start from a linear r-t relation which is quite far away from the assume 'true' r-t and by using tracks which have limited angular spread.

## Example at \(\theta=50^{\circ}\)

An example of results obtained in our study is shown in Fig. 2. This is at \(\theta=50^{\circ}\) by using tracks within angular limit of \(\pm 5^{\circ}\). The \(x\)-axis is for true drift distance \(r_{true}\). The \(y\)-axis is the residuals after a certain number of iterations (\(\Delta_{r}=r_{true}-r_{fit}\)). The accuracy of convergence is already extremely good after 10 iterations. After 20 iterations (shown in the lower part of Fig. 2 with an expanded scale), the calibration converges to \(<1\mu\)m.

Figure 3 shows similar results obtained by the same autocalibration procedure using tracks within the angle range of \(\pm 2.5^{\circ}\). The converging process is slightly slower in this case. After 20 iterations, the results are quite satisfactory. We also tried wider angular spread. It is generally true that the wider the track angular distribution, the faster and the better the autocalibration converges.

## Detector Position Dependence

The angle between the incident tracks and the chamber planes is from \(35^{\circ}\) to \(90^{\circ}\) for the Barrel chambers and from \(55^{\circ}\) to \(85^{\circ}\) for Forward and Intermediate chambers. The autocalibration performance is different at different \(\theta\) angle in the MDT. We studied the autocalibration performance for the barrel MDT from \(\theta=40^{\circ}\) to \(90^{\circ}\). The results of this study obviously also can be applied to the forward and intermediate regions.

Fig. 4-7 show the autocalibration converging processes at different locations in the MDT. Fig. 4(a) and 4(b) are at \(\theta=40^{\circ}\) with track angular sprcad of \(\pm 2.5^{\circ}\) and \(\pm 5^{\circ}\) respectively. Again, the converging speed is better for larger track angular spread. Fig. 5(a) shows that the autocalibration does not converge at \(\theta=60^{\circ}\) if the track angular spread is small (\(\pm 5^{\circ}\)). But the procedure converges if the track angular spread is extended to \(\pm 10^{\circ}\) (Fig. 5(b)). Fig. 6(a) and 6(b) are at \(80^{\circ}\) with track angular spread of \(\pm 2.5^{\circ}\) and \(\pm 5^{\circ}\) respectively. Fig. 7(a) shows at the region of \(\theta=90^{\circ}\), the autocalibration also does not converge if the track angular spread is small (\(\pm 5^{\circ}\)). It, however, converges for track angular spread of \(\pm 10^{\circ}\) (Fig. 7(b)).

In Table 1, the converging precision after 20 th iteration at different \(\theta\) angles is given. The angular spread of tracks used is \(\pm 5^{\circ}\).

Table 1. Converging accuracy after 20 iterations.

\begin{tabular}{||l|c|c|c|c|c|c||} \hline Chamber Position (\(\theta\)) & 90 & 80 & 70 & 60 & 50 & 40 \\ \hline Converging precision (\(\mu\)m) (\(\pm 2.5^{\circ}\) track angular spread) & ** & 5 & 5 & ** & \(<\) & 2.5 \\ \hline Converging precision (\(\mu\)m) (\(\pm 10^{\circ}\) track angular spread) & 5 & - & - & 600 & - & - \\ \hline \end{tabular}

In the tables in this note, "-" indicates that the particular case is not studied. "\(\ast\ast\ast\ast\)" indicates that the autocalibration does not converge at all. When the tracks used in the autocalibration have a \(\pm 10^{\circ}\) spread instead of \(\pm 2.5^{\circ}\), the autocalibration can converge at \(\theta=90^{\circ}\). After 20 iterations, the converge accuracy at \(60^{\circ}\) is still very poor.

Table 2 summarizes how many iterations are needed to obtain \(\sim 5\mu\)m converging precision at each \(\theta\) angle.

Table 3 shows how many iterations are needed to reach 1 \(\mu\)m.

## Three Tube Layers

For the 3 tube-layer case, the converging speed of autocalibration is much slower than that for 4 tube-layer case. Due to the limited CPU, we only studied this issue for chamber position around \(\theta=70^{\circ}\) by using only tracks with a \(\pm 5^{\circ}\) angular spread. A comparison of the converging processes for the 3 tube layer layout and the 4 tube layer layout is given in Fig. 8 and Fig. 9. It is apparent that the converging speed is much slower in the case of 3 tube layer layout. But it eventually converges nicely. Compared to the earlier study, the differences between the 3 tube layer layout and the 4 tube layer layout are now much more clear. This is because we put a limit on the the angular spread of the tracks used in the new study. Table 4 gives the converging precision after 20 iterations in the two cases.

**Table 4. Converging precision after 20 th iteration at \(\theta=70^{\circ}\).**

\begin{tabular}{||l|c|c|c||} \hline  & 4 tube layer layout & 3 tube layer layout \\ \hline Converging precision & \(\sim 30\mu\)m & \(\sim 1500\mu\)m \\ \hline \end{tabular}

The converging process in the case of 3 tube layer layout, although very slow, eventually converges after many iterations. The number of iterations needed to achieve 5 \(\mu\)m is summarized in Table 5.

## 4 Converging Problem at \(60^{\circ}\) and \(90^{\circ}\)

As we have seen from the results above, the autocalibration may have a converging problem at \(60^{\circ}\) and \(90^{\circ}\) if we start from a r-t relation which is far apart from the true r-t and use tracks with too small an angular spread. In general within a multilayer with four layers of tubes, there are two constrains from the four hits to define a track. At \(60^{\circ}\), the four hits from a projective track forms a approximately straight line which is parallel to the line connecting the four anode wires in the hit tubes. This effectively reduces the constrains to one which is not enough to make the autocalibration to converge. At \(90^{\circ}\), the four hits from a projective track forms a approximately two segments of straight lines which are parallel to the lines connecting the two pairs of anode wires in the hit tubes. This effectively reduces the constrains to two which are also not enough to make the autocalibration to converge.

In real experiment, the tracks which will be used for autocalibration will have certain amount of angular spread. The initial r-t should be quite close to the true one. The autocalibration converging may not be a problem. However, in case there is a problem, for example if autocalibration does not converge at certain \(\theta\) angles, we can try the following approach.

1. Finding approximate r-t by using tracks with broader angle spread. Since the tracks with broader angular distribution tends to have lower momentum, the achievable precision may be lower. Because of the sagitta of the low momentum tracks is any way limited, it should be no problem to obtain a converging precision at 100-200 \(\mu\)m level.
2. Refining the found r-t by using high momentum tracks. We can try to further refine the r-t relation by repeating the autocalibration by using high momentum tracks.

In order to demonstrate this approach, we repeated our study at \(90^{\circ}\). This time instead of starting the autocalibration by using a linear r-t, we start the procedure from a r-t which is not too far apart from the true r-t. The results are shown in Fig. 10. In Fig. 10 (a), the curve with "0" is the initial r-t relation. The largest

deviation from "true" r-t relation is about 700 \(\mu\)m. In Fig. 10(b), the converging precision after 100 and 120 iterations is shown. After 120 iterations, the converging precision is approximately 3.5 \(\mu\)m.
