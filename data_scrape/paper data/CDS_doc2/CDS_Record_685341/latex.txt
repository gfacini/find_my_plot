###### Abstract

A major step in the construction of the SCT end-caps is the process of mounting the modules onto the discs and testing them. This note contains a description of the proposed assembly procedure and the design of the necessary jig to assemble inner, middle, and outer modules to the end-cap disc structure. Results obtained using prototype jigs are described.

## 1 Introduction

The ATLAS Semiconductor Tracker (SCT) consists of a central barrel structure with two end-caps. Each end-cap consists of a support cylinder containing 9 discs populated with forward modules. Each silicon module is a delicate piece of equipment, comprising 4 silicon wafers, sandwiched back to back on a TPG (Thermal Pyrolytic Graphite) spine, with a CU/Kapton hybrid assembly fixed to the end. (See fig 1). These units are assembled under clean room conditions and are thoroughly tested but they can easily be damaged by careless handling. The procedure and equipment for assembling these modules into a macro structure must be carefully thought out to minimise the risk of damage.

Each module needs to be delicately mounted onto the disc structure, with minimum handling, and minimum forces on the module. The mounting process requires a set of tooling which will enable the safe handling of forward silicon modules while mounting them onto high precision mounting blocks on the disc. Once mounted the modules will undergo thermal cycling and electronic testing. The thermal performance will also be evaluated. The final step will be to perform metrology on the finsihed disk.

The concept for mounting modules is outlined in section 2 and details of the tooling required are described in section 3. Section 4 describes the assembly and QA procedure. The results obtained while evaluating prototype jigs are discussed in section 5. The forces on the module due to the procedure for mounting and dismounting a module or due to the insertion of connectors are discussed in section 6.

## 2 Basic Concept

The mounting procedure is designed to minimise risks to the module and involves the following features:-

1. Assembly is performed in a class 10000 clean room.
2. The modules are handled in mechanical jigs and are not touched by hand.
3. The mounting system allows the disk to rotate in a vertical plane so that modules are always mounted at the lowest point to avoid possible damage from anything accidently falling down.
4. The mounting jig should allow the positioning of the module over the mounting blocks to high precision.
5. The mounting step should utilise the minimum of force on the module and ensure a high degree of planarity between the module and the mounting blocks.
6. The fixations to hold the module on the disc should be handled in a secure way so that they cannot fall during the securement of the module to the disc.

Assembly Tooling

This tooling is required in order to assemble inner, outer and middle modules onto a CFRP honeycomb disc which is already populated with power tapes, cooling pipes, mounting blocks optical fibres etc.

The tooling comprises of 3 main components shown in fig 2.

1. The disc mounting frame assembly, which supports the disc assembly, and provides local connectors for system testing.
2. The module support stand, which holds the module in its frame, prior to being removed from the frame.
3. Module placement fixture, which picks up and places modules onto the cooling blocks.
4. The whole assembly is supported on a breadboard type surface table on wheels, on which the whole assembly is supported.

### Disc Mounting Frame Assembly

The disc frame assembly (fig 3) is used to securely support the disc assembly whilst the modules are being placed. The disc will stay in this frame throughout the module assembly, and other operations and tests such as module survey, electronic testing and thermal tests.

This assembly comprises of the following:

1. Disc Assembly
2. CFRP and Honeycomb mini short support cylinder, with brackets to the bearing track.
3. Invar bearing track.
4. 3 pairs of roller ball bearings, housed in a 'V' block assembly.
5. Aluminium extrusion frame.

The disc is housed in the CFRP cylinder using fixings identical to the ones used to fix the disc into the main support cylinder. These are connected to tapped holes in the outer edge of the disc. The cylinder bolts to the invar ring using 10 aluminium interface lugs. The ring rests on the two lower bearing housings which are allowed to adjust along the beam axis only. The upper bearing housing is spring loaded, to apply a constant force to the ring. The ring is then free to rotate in the bearings.

The principle of the CFRP/invar sub assembly, is to provide a very low CTE (in the order 1.5 ppm) structure for the disc, which is simply constrained in the 3 bearings, and applies a minimum force to the disc. The outer frame is then 'free' to distort with temperature change, and not put undue stresses on the disc, due to the floating spring loaded top bearing.

The cylinder assembly is rotated by hand, and is indexed using a spring loaded plunger and dowel holes in the ring.

Patch panels and access slots are provided on the CFRP cylinder, which can be connected and disconnected, for system testing etc. This disc will have local short power tapes and opto cables??, which will need to be connected a minimum number of times, in order to reduce wear on the connectors. Also access to the cooling pipes are available, via local connectors

### Module Support Stand

Prior to assembling the module onto the disc, it needs to be removed from its handling frame. (fig 4) However, to do this, it needs to be securely retained, and allow the module placement fixture to remove it, without placing undue stresses on the module.

The handling frame and module are first placed onto the stand, by sliding over the 4 clearance fit dowels. The module is fixed using slider clamps, which clamp onto the outer rim of the handling frame. When it is securely clamped, the module can now be removed using the placement fixture.

### Module Placement Fixture

Placement of the module onto the cooling blocks requires an accurate placement fixture, which positions the module onto the block location pins, and allows suitable nuts and washers to be applied. In addition, the module is to be kept parallel to the disc, in order that the pin does not locate crooked, or have a module to module wire bond clash. The placement fixture comprises of the following features (Fig 5):

1. Module clamps. These hold the module in 'v' grooves, which grip the hybrid and end AIN support, by operating the lever. The clamps have a certain amount of play, so as to create a self-centering mechanism.
2. Horizontal slider, for pushing the module onto the blocks.
3. CCD cameras, which show the relationship of the spigot pins on the block to the holes in the module. These are also on a slider, on order to move the cameras out of the way, whilst applying the nuts.
4. Rotation stage, in line with the hybrid location hole.
5. Support Stand.
6. Transverse Stage.
7. Vertical Stage.
8. Coarse horizontal slider.

## 4 Assembly Procedure

### Disc into Tooling Assembly Procedure

The disc will arrive at the module assembly lab in a suitable container, and fixed to the CFRP cylinder using the appropriate fittings. The cylinder will be attached to the container using the aluminium lugs on the outer rim of the cylinder. Also the front and back face of the disc will be protected using a suitable cover, say CFRP honeycomb sheet, creating and enclosed cylinder structure. The cylinder/disc assembly will be taken out of the container using a lifting jig.

### General Procedure and QA

The first stage is to perform an acceptance test on the disc which will consist of the following steps:-

1. Visual inspection
2. Leak test of the cooling circuits
3. Continuity tests for the cable harnesses
4. Continuity tests for the optical fibres
5. A metrology check of the positions of the mounting pins

The modules to be mounted will have been fully characterised at the various module assembly centres and those received from external centres will also undergo an acceptance test before mounting onto the disk.

Since the modules overlap it is necessary to mount all the 'lower' modules first. Once this is done the disc will be placed in an environmental chamber and temperature cycled. The services will be connected. The evaporative cooling will then be switched on and bias applied to the detectors. The electronic functionality will then be tested and a noise scan will be performed.

The disc will then be disconnected from the services and the 'upper' modules will then be mounted. The testing cycle will then be repeated.

A soak test of 100 hrs will then be performed with the environmental chamber at -10\({}^{0}\)C. The final metrology step will be to mount the (disconnected) disc on a CMM and measure the positions of the fiducials on each module relative to fiducials on the disc.

### Module Mounting

Modules will arrive in a handling frame and a suitable box. The frame and module is fixed to the support stand with the two slider clamps, and positioned in a pre determined location on the surface table, in front of the placement fixture. The module assembly procedure is described thus:

1. Push the whole stage along the course horizontal slider to within a few cm of the module.
2. Use the horizontal slider to push the clamps up to the module, up to the locator stop.
3. Rotate lever to close clamps, undo clips, and pull slider to remove module from handling frame.
4. Pull module back using course slider, and remove support stand.
5. Push back with course slider, to pre determined stop, and slide cameras into place.
6. Use rotation, horizontal and vertical stages to align the spigot to the holes.
7. Push module onto blocks, feeling for any snags which may occur. Lock horizontal slider.
8. Slide the cameras out of the way. Fix nuts in place using a box spanner, and tighten to pre determined torque.
9. Rotate lever, release lock, and pull back clamps using horizontal slider, pull right back using course slider.
10. Rotate wheel to next indexed point on rim, and repeat process.

## 5 Prototypes

Prototypes of the module assembly tooling have been made, in order to test the mechanical integrity of the design. This comprises of a CFRP cylinder, manufactured in 8 segments, carbon steel bearing track, aluminium frame, and 3 pairs of bearings in vee housings. As a structure this is very stable, and the track rotates in the bearings smoothly.

A complete module placement fixture, according to the final specification has been manufactured, and is set up on a dummy disc sector, complete with spigoted cooling blocks. A dummy outer module with a BeO hybrid base has been assembled and disassembled about 20 times with relative ease, without damage to the module. In addition tests including removing a module which has been smeared with thermal grease and screwed down have been successfully performed.

Figure 6 shows a picture of the prototype module placement fixture that has been developed and shows the principal components as listed above. In the final system three different rings of modules will need to be mounted on the disks. To allow this, the fixture will be adapted with a quick-release kinematic mount positioned on top of the transverse stage. The coarse horizontal slider (8), the vertical stage (7) and the transverse stage (6) will be duplicated to the rear of the disk, together with a quick-release base. The support-stand, rotation stage, CCD cameras, horizontal slider and module clamp will be replicated for each of the ring-types.

Figure 7 shows the prototype bearing housing employing two opposed ball transfer units (BUTs) mounted on the structural support frame. Three such sets of bearings are used to locate the steel ring into which the disk in its'stubby cylinder' are mounted. This arrangement allows the disk to rotate without any structural members obscuring any part of it which is useful for survey purposes.

Figure 8 shows a plot of the X and Y residuals for the positions of the module, determined by touch-probing the hybrid location holes, during a series of mount-dismount cycles. In general the X-residuals are all below 5 \(\upmu\)m indicating that the module placement system is capable of mounting modules with close toleranced holes and location pins. In some cases the Y-residuals are larger than 5 \(\upmu\)m. Investigations revealed that this was due to an error in the measurement procedure which resulted in significant variations in the Y values to be recorded. The measurement procedure was corrected for cycles 5 to 10.

Forces & Moments on SCT Endcap Modules During Assembly

Forces and moments exerted on ATLAS SCT endcap modules can arise during the mounting/de-mounting to the disks and cable insertion/withdrawal are presented.

### 6.1 Cable Insertion

Data on the forces required to insert and withdraw connectors has been collated from manufacturers' specifications and test measurements performed on samples. The connectors used on the endcap module are 1mm pitch from Specialaty. The general specifications for these connectors are found in [http://www.connectorsolutions.com/pdfs/1mm_con_specs.pdf](http://www.connectorsolutions.com/pdfs/1mm_con_specs.pdf).

The insertion force is quoted as 150 gmf per contact and the withdrawal force is \(<40\) gmf per contact.

#### 6.1.1Measurements on Samples

Measurements of the force required to mate a subset of pins from an 18-way sample were made using a 0-50g force meter. When keeping the two halves of the connector parallel whilst mating two contacts requires a force of \(\sim 60\)g. Doing the same but allowing the connectors to rock reduces the force to \(\sim 25\)-30g. Repeating this with 4 contacts gives a force of \(\sim 55\)g. In the following table it is assumed that full sized connectors can be mated by rocking and that this requires a force of 15g per contact.

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|} \hline
**Connector** & **Contacts** & **Force** \\ \hline Power & 13 x 2 & 390 g \\ \hline Bypass & 3 x 2 & 90g \\ \hline Opto & 4 x 2 & 120 g \\ \hline Bypass in test mode & 7 x 2 & 210 g \\ \hline \end{tabular} The female part of the connector is mounted on the hybrid and the male part on the kapton tape. The body of the male part is in fact one pair of pins longer than the female but has the extra pins removed giving an overhang beyond the end of the female part of the connector. This provides a point of leverage to facilitate the extraction of the connectors. Both the bypass and opto connectors have an overhang to one side only whilst the power connector has an overhang on both sides.

### 6.2 Module Mounting / De-mounting

Estimates of the forces acting on a module during mounting and de-mounting have been evaluated using the prototype system at Liverpool. The module is held at two points on the edge of the hybrid and two points on the far end aluminium nitride wings by two support arms that are linked mechanically by springs. The plane of the module is defined by the support arms and two hollow cylindrical bushes that are in contact with the surfaces of the precision location washers at either end of the module.

Three distinct conditions can be identified;

1. Forces acting on module held in 'grabber'  In this case the only forces acting on the module are an in-plane compression due to the action of the springs that keep the module held in between the top and bottom pincers. This force can be adjusted by moving the spring anchor points. Currently the combined effect of the two springs is about 200 g compared to a module mass of \(\sim 20\)g.
2. Forces acting on module as it is offered up to the cooling block The module mounting procedure involves the iterative alignment of the module location holes with the location pins of the cooling blocks aided by real-time optical feedback from CCD cameras viewing the two location points. As the module is slid over the alignment pins there is sufficient'slop' in the system to allow the module to locate itself on the pins in the correct manner.

As the module comes into contact with the cooling block surfaces the two hollow cylindrical bushes encircling the module location points act on the module. In this way there are no forces acting perpendicular to the module provided the height of the precision washer relative to the hybrid baseboard and the aluminium nitride far-end wing are as per the design. Any deviation from this will impose some degree of stress on the module.
3. Forces acting on module as it is pulled off the cooling block Mechanical mock-ups of BeO hybrid equipped modules have been mounted and de-mounted on a dummy disk sector. The module was mounted on the cooling block with a thin layer of Dow Corning DC340 thermal grease at the module/block interface. This has been repeated several times without damage to the module. These tests have not been carried out with either the carbon fibre or carbon-carbon laminated with the kapton hybrid circuit elements. These tests need to be repeated with the up-to-date substrate material.

A measure of the force required to separate a module from its block has been determined. The module was mounted onto a cooling block with a thin layer of DC340 at the interface. The mounting nut was tightened and the module left for time periods of 10 to 30 minutes. The mounting nut was then slackened off and the module was pulled off the block using a loop of wire passing through the alignment holes in the hybrid. A 50g force meter was used to pull the module off the block. The position along the finger at which the force acted was adjusted to give a reading within the 0-50g range. The release force is indicated by a secondary needle that records the maximum force acting on the finger. The proper force is determined by imposing the same force at the same position on the finger onto a 0-200 g balance and recording the measured force. The range of forces resulting from several trials is \(\sim 170\) g.

During the electrical testing of K4 modules at Liverpool, modules have been mounted/dismounted by hand onto the two cooling blocks several times without the aid of the module mounting tooling. To achieve good thermal performance DC340 thermal grease has been applied to the hybrid-end cooling block only. The modules, held in the UK-type plastic handling frame, have been successfully dismounted without damage to the module. This is made easier if the module/cooling block system is at some elevated temperature (e.g. 40 \({}^{\circ}\)C).

## Summary

A procedure for mounting forward SCT modules onto the support discs has been proposed. The sequence of events including the precision mounting step, thermal cycling, thermal and electronic evaluation has been outlined. The central feature is the design of the tooling to accomplish the mounting of the modules in a manner that minimizes any risk to the module. The measurements obtained with prototype tooling show that the design presented fulfills all the requirements.
