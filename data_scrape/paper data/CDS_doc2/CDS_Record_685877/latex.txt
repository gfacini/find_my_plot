A novel electro-optical alignment monitoring system has been developed for the muon spectrometer of the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider. The modular components are straightness monitors consisting of semi-transparent optical sensors which measure the position of a traversing laser beam. The system allows to control the alignment of multiple stations along one beam over large distances thus providing an economical solution for a variety of alignment problems. We have tested two types of custom designed optical position sensors which are based on the principle of silicon strip photodiodes. Position resolutions of better than 2 \(\mu\)m and light transmission rates above 70% for suitable laser wavelengths have been achieved with prototype sensors.

Motivation and Principle

For large muon spectrometers like the ones planned for the detectors at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), accurate alignment of the high precision muon chambers is essential to achieve the desired momentum resolution. In the ATLAS detector [1] the momentum of a muon will be determined from the sagitta of the muon track measured in three layers of high precision muon chambers inside the magnetic field of a superconducting air-core toroid. In order to achieve an overall track position measurement to better than 100 \(\mu\)m in each chamber plane, which is required to achieve the desired momentum resolution, the contribution to the position uncertainty from relative misalignment of the chamber planes traversed by a muon must be less than 50 \(\mu\)m. Continuous monitoring of the relative chamber positions is required in order to guarantee the alignment tolerances over time.

In the barrel part of the ATLAS muon spectrometer, the three layers of muon chambers are arranged in projective towers which contain the trajectories of high momentum muons coming from the interaction point. The relative alignment of the chambers within a tower can be efficiently monitored by a set of projective light rays pointing to the interaction region and connecting the corners of the three chamber planes which are equipped with precision mounted optical sensors [2] (see Figure 1).

By monitoring the deviations of the light rays from straight lines and interpolating between the measurements at the chamber corners, misalignment corrections can be derived for the sagittae of muons traversing the chamber tower. A sufficient number of reference rays allows to correct for relative translations, rotations, thermal expansion and limited gravitational sag of the chambers. The projective geometry allows to minimize the number of required alignment beams per tower. The internal stiffness of individual chambers can also be controlled by similar straightness monitors integrated in the chamber planes.

The aim for the ATLAS muon spectrometer is a precision on the muon sagitta corrections of better than 30 \(\mu\)m [3]. This requires a precision of the optical sensors in the bending direction of the toroidal magnetic field (along the beam axis z) on the order of \(10-20\)\(\mu\)m. In the transverse (\(\tau\phi\)) plane, a less precise position measurement to better than 100 \(\mu\)m is also required.

A novel electro-optical alignment monitoring system has been developed for the ATLAS muon spectrometer. It is optimised for the projective alignment of large chamber systems. Laser beams are used as straightness references and are detected by semi-transparent optical position sensors in multiple consecutive layers without being blocked.

The sensors provide absolute two-dimensional position measurement over a large sensitive range of at least \(20\times 20\) mm\({}^{2}\) which is required for the monitoring of movements in large chamber systems. The chambers can be aligned over large distances by using collimated (diffraction limited) laser beams with limited diameter over a given distance, e.g. less than 3 mm diameter over 8 m which is the largest distance for projective rays in the barrel part of the ATLAS muon spectrometer. The system is adaptable to large and varying angles of incidence of the projective laser beams on the sensors. This allows for easier and uniform mounting of the sensors surfaces parallel to the chamber planes.

An attractive feature of the alignment concept with transparent optical sensors is the possibility to align many stations along a single light beam. This offers conceptually simple and economical solutions for many alignment problems, in particular for the precise alignment of extended structures. In extension of the 3-point internal alignment of the individual muon chamber towers, one can simultaneously align adjacent towers in \(r\phi\) and/or \(rz\) by letting their sensors overlap in a common laser beam (see Figure 2). \(5-11\) sensors have to be aligned on each beam in this scheme. The number of alignment beams needed for the muon spectrometer can be reduced by factors \(2-4\) with the advantage of lower cost and saving in the dead space in the chamber layers which has to be reserved for the alignment rays. At the same time one obtains information on the relative alignment of adjacent towers. A cost effective solution for the alignment system is an important consideration for the ATLAS muon spectrometer where several hundreds of straightness monitors will be employed.

Global alignment of each barrel chamber layer can be achieved with axial laser beams connecting all chambers of a layer where each chamber is equipped with at least two transparent sensors per beam. Similar multi-point straightness monitors with radial laser beams are needed to monitor the internal alignment of large chamber wheels in the endcap spectrometer which consist of several radial segments.

Movements of the chambers on different time scales, including vibrations if necessary, can be monitored due to the fast direct position information delivered by the sensors.

Beyond the use in the ATLAS muon spectrometer, the multi-stage alignment system has applications in the central tracker of the ATLAS experiment as well as in other large detector systems, for example in fixed-target experiments where chamber towers consisting of many layers have to be accurately aligned. It is planned to use the alignment system for the tracking detector of the HERA-B experiment at DESY (see [4]). It is also under consideration for the alignment of accelerator components. Finally, there are commercial applications which in general do not require the high sensor precision on the order of \(10\)\(\mu\)m which is attempted for the ATLAS muon spectrometer.

## 2 The Optical Sensors

Two types of position-sensitive semi-transparent optical sensors have been studied and are being further improved in collaboration with industry. Both sensor technologies are based on the principle of microstrip detectors which provide accurate and robust position measurement of the laser beam. The strip segmentation provides pattern recognition capability and allows to eliminate in this way disturbances by background light and beam reflections (only relevant for short sensor spacing). The laser beam profile can be measured and monitored; selective readout of only the signal strips is possible.

In view of achieving the required high position resolution over the whole sensitive area, strip detectors are easier to calibrate than large area position sensitive photodiodes (PSD) working on the principle of resistive current division. The latter are limited by non-linearities in the position information due to unavoidable inhomogeneity of the resistive layer.

### Silicon Strip Photodiodes

Silicon strip photodiodes produced in planar technology on silicon wafers have been investigated as a possible sensor technology. The by now standard technology of silicon strip detectors used for mini-vertex particle detectors has been adapted and optimised for optical position measurements.

At room temperature, the bandgap of crystalline silicon (c-Si) is 1.12 eV corresponding to a maximum wavelength of 1100 nm up to which the silicon sensors are sensitive. The absorption curve of silicon is dropping steeply near the infrared sensitivity limit (see Figure 3). The absorption coefficient of silicon at \(300^{\circ}\) K and \(\lambda=1064\) has been measured by several authors[5],[6] in the range \(\alpha\approx 9-11\) cm\({}^{-1}\) which corresponds to internal transmitances \(T_{\rm int}=e^{-\alpha d}\) (corrected for reflection) of \(72-76\%\) for a \(d=300\)\(\mu\)m thick silicon wafer. The total transmittance including reflection losses at both surfaces is given by

\[T=\frac{(1-R)^{2}e^{-\alpha d}}{1-R^{2}e^{-2\alpha d}} \tag{1}\]

with the reflectivity (see below) depending on the refractive index n:

\[R=\frac{(n-1)^{2}+(\alpha\lambda/4\pi)^{2}}{(n+1)^{2}+(\alpha\lambda/4\pi)^{ 2}}. \tag{2}\]

Collimated light beams with Gaussian profile at a wavelength of 1064 nm can be produced with Nd:YAG lasers or, alternatively, with InGaAs laser diodes. In the latter case, the laser light must be coupled into a single-mode optical fiber glued to the diode from which a diffraction limited Gaussian beam can be extracted via a suitable collimator optics. Also in the case of the Nd:YAG laser, coupling of the infrared laser light into a single-mode fiber (which only transmits the TEM\({}_{00}\) mode) is advantageous for the quality and stability of the beam profile.

The silicon strip photodiodes have been custom designed by CSEM in Switzerland for optical applications. They have the following properties (see also Figure 4):

* The active area of \(20\times 20\) mm\({}^{2}\) provides a large measurement range.
* The active area is segmented into 67 implanted p\({}^{+}\) strips on the n-doped substrate, with 300 \(\mu\)m pitch and 280 \(\mu\)m width, i.e. with a 40 \(\mu\)m wide gap between the strips. The strip pitch is optimised for measuring the spot position of a diffraction limited laser beam of \(2-3\) mm diameter.
* The strips are directly connected via contact holes to aluminum contact pads outside the active area at both ends. The contact to the n-bulk is provided by a global n\({}^{+}\) implant on the front side which only leaves the p\({}^{+}\) strips out and which is contacted via an aluminum ring surrounding the active area. There is no metallisation on front or back side in the active area in order not to prevent light transmission.
* The sensitivity of the photodiodes at 1064 nm of about 0.1 A/W is by far sufficient such that the measurements are not affected by detector or electronics noise.

* Anti-reflective coating consisting of a double layer of silicon nitride (30 nm) on top of silicon oxide (90 nm) on both surfaces reduces the reflection rate to 2.6% per surface at 1064 nm and normal incidence. This is essential for achieving high transmittance because of the high refractive index of silicon (\(n=3.58\) at 1064 nm) which leads to high reflectivity.
* The sensors are manufactured on \((300\pm 10)\)\(\mu\)m thick silicon wafers with \(\{100\}\) crystal orientation perpendicular to the surface. With this crystal orientation one expects higher mechanical rigidity of the sensors compared to \(\{111\}\) wafers and favorable properties for a possible mechanical or chemical thinning of the detector material (see below). The light transmittance of the sensors, including reflection losses, has been measured to be \((71.3\pm 1)\)% at 1064 nm. Taking into account refelction, this corresponds to an absorption coefficient of \(\alpha\approx 9.5\) cm\({}^{-1}\) which lies in the lower range of previous measurements[6]. There may be a dependence of the absorption coefficient on the doping concentration for photon energies near the band gap (see [7]). With this transmission rate, 4% of the initial power of the light beam is still left after traversing 10 detectors. Varying light intensity can be handled with adaptable readout electronics. In order to preserve the beam during transmission, the wafers have been polished on both sides. An unpolished back side would cause destruction of the beam by diffuse scattering.
* Electrical properties: The detectors can be operated without bias voltage. In this mode, junction capacitances of 278 pF and dark currents \(<100\) pA per strip have been measured. The diode capacitance value is in agreement with the expectation from the low bulk resistivity of \(20-25\)\(\Omega\)cm corresponding to a doping concentration of \(2\cdot 10^{14}\)/cm\({}^{3}\). The high p\({}^{+}\) strip resistance of 20.8 k\(\Omega\) (no aluminum lines are deposited on top) is useful if one wants to use current division information on the strips for the second coordinate (see section 3). The reverse bias breakdown voltage of the strip diodes is 28 V. The limiting factor is the high electric field in the small gap between the n\({}^{+}\) implant and the p\({}^{+}\) strips in the present layout. On a 4 inch silicon wafer one can fit 8 detectors with \(20\times 20\) mm\({}^{2}\) active area. 136 sensors of this type have been produced so far. 16 derives with the smaller area of \(14\times 14\) mm\({}^{2}\) (in case the reduced measurement range is sufficient) would fit on the same wafer size. Since for the low-ohmic subtrate the depletion layer is only about 1 \(\mu\)m deep and the total sensitive depth is on the order of 20 \(\mu\)m (diffusion zone), the transmittance can in principle be increased without loss in sensitivity by making the sensors thinner from the back side after processing. A 100 \(\mu\)m thick sensor with anti-reflective coating would have a total transmission rate of 86% which leaves 22% (10%) of the initial power after 10 (15) sensors. Anisotropic selective chemical etching of the sensor back side just below the active area could be an appropriate technique. It can be used for the existing sensors where the \(\{100\}\)crystal axis is oriented perpendicular to the surface. In this crystal direction, the etching speed is about 10 times faster than in other directions. Thicknesses of \(20-40\)\(\mu\)m have been achieved with selective KOH etching of single-sided processed wafers[8].

Another thinning technique being investigated is mechanical grinding and polishing of the whole back side of the wafer. Wafers polished down to 200 \(\mu\)m thickness have already been obtained. Thicknesses of \(50-100\)\(\mu\)m appear possible. We also consider silicon-on-sapphire (SOS) wafers for sensor production which are used for high-density VLSI circuits. With typically 50 \(\mu\)m thick c-Si layers deposited on Al\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{3}\) substrates of a few hundred micron thickness, this substrate material combines high infrared transmittance with good mechanical stability. The elctrical properties still have to be investigated.

For applications at low temperature, e.g. the alignment of superconducting cavities or magnets of particle accelerators, there is the possibility of improving the transmittance by operating the sensors at liquid nitrogen or helium temperatures. The bandgap and therefore the absorption length of silicon increase with lower temperatures.

The sensors have strips only in one coordinate which will be used for the high precision measurement in the bending direction of the muon spectrometer magnet. The second coordinate can be determined with sufficient precision for the ATLAS application via resistive current division on the individual strips which are read out at both ends. In principle, one can also implant p\({}^{+}\)n strip diodes on the opposite side of the undepleted bulk with 90\({}^{\circ}\) stereo angle with respect to the front side for the determination of the second coordinate. This would, however, double the number of processing steps and increase the cost.

### Amorphous Silicon Strip Sensors

An alternative semi-transparent optical sensor technology are Schottky barrier photodiodes consisting of a thin film of undoped hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) as active material deposited between two conducting layers of indium tin oxide (ITO) on a glass substrate (see Figure 5). The \(\leq 1\)\(\mu\)m thick a-Si film is deposited by chemical vapor deposition at low temperature \(<300^{\circ}\) C (plasma enhanced CVD). The vapor deposited ITO layers are 100 nm thick and transparent over the visible and near infrared spectral range with about 90% transmittance at 690 nm.

Both conducting layers are segmented into orthogonal rows of strips by photolithographic methods forming a double-sided strip detector. Amorphous silicon photodiodes for position measurements are produced by Heimann Optoelectronics in Germany. Large detector areas (presently up to \(300\times 300\) mm\({}^{2}\)) can be produced in a single piece with high position resolution and linearity over the whole surface.

The sensors are operated with a bias voltage of \(1-4\) V between the two conducting layers. The Schottky diodes on the top side are reverse biased; the strips at the bottom act as ohmic contacts. The undoped a-Si film is sensitive over its full thickness of about 1 \(\mu\)m since the depletion depth of the Schottky diodes as well as the charge carrier diffusion length in amorphous silicon are of the same size.

We have started tests with custom designed \(13\times 13\) mm\({}^{2}\) and \(20\times 20\) mm\({}^{2}\) transparent a-Si sensor prototypes which have 32 (64) strips on each side of the amorphous silicon layer with 400 \(\mu\)m (312.5 \(\mu\)m) pitch and 20 \(\mu\)m (10 \(\mu\)m) gap between the strips. The glass substrate of the prototypes is 0.5 mm thick, determined by the present production process.

The optical absorption of a-Si:H in the visible range is much higher than for crystalline silicon (see Figure 3) but ends already at \(\lambda\approx 820\) nm because of the larger effective band gap of amorphous silicon. The optical absorption coefficient decreases with increasing hydrogen concentration due to saturation of dangling bond states of silicon located in the effective band gap. The hydrogen concentration depends on the production process of the a-Si films, in particular on the process temperature. High hydrogen concentrations are achieved by film deposition at low temperatures of \(200-300^{\circ}\) C with glow-discharge decomposition of silan (SiH\({}_{4}\)).

The amorphous silicon sensors can be operated in transparent mode at wavelengths in the visible range. Red light of 690 nm is already close to the sensitivity limit and conveniently produced by (relatively cheap) silicon laser diodes. High quality diffraction limited Gaussian beams can be achieved with semiconductor laser diodes by coupling the light into a single-mode optical fiber which is by now a standard technology, at least in the visible range. At 690 nm, the responsivity of the a-Si sensors is still 0.1 A/W, comparable with the crystalline silicon sensors.

We have measured transmission rates of \(55-60\%\) for the a-Si sensor prototypes at 690 nm. The variations a likely due to varying processing conditions and layer thicknesses. Taking into account losses due to reflection and absorption in the ITO layers, the results correspond to an absorption coefficient of the sensor a-Si:H films of \(\alpha\approx(2-3)\cdot 10^{3}\) cm\({}^{-1}\) in accordance with other measurements for hydrogenated amorphous silicon (see [9]).

The transmittance can be further increased by reducing the thickness of the a-Si film, by matching the optical thicknesses of the a-Si and ITO layers on the glass substrate and by adding anti-reflective coating on the reverse side of the substrate. This requires no additional processing steps. Test measurements with varying layer thicknesses of a-Si and ITO down to 400 nm and 50 nm, respectively, indicate that transmission rates of around 80% can be reached at \(\lambda=690\) nm. Reduction of the a-Si thickness below 1 \(\mu\)m, however, also reduces the sensitivity of the diodes since they are active over their full depth.

The amorphous silicon strip detectors are still under development. Optimisation with respect to high transmittance and minimum distortion of the traversing beam for high precision measurements (see section 4) is going on in collaboration with the producer. The glass substrates of the prototype sensors neither have polished surfaces nor anti-reflective coating yet. A major advantage of the a-Si sensors is the possibility to deposite them on polished glass substrates of high optical quality with respect to parallelity and minimum surface roughness. We expect that this feature, together with the small thickness (\(\leq 1\)\(\mu\)m) of the amorphous silicon film and the relatively low refractive index of glass, will keep the defelction of the laser beam at a minimum.

The production process of the a-Si sensors is adopted from the thin-film technology which is commercially used for the large area production of solar cells and of thin-film transistor arrays for LCD control. The simple layered structure of the devices and low temperature processing promise relatively low-cost production. 16 sensors of \(20\times 20\) mm\({}^{2}\) active area or 36 devices of \(13\times 13\) mm\({}^{2}\) area fit on \(11\times 11\) cm\({}^{2}\) glass substrates which are typically used in the production.

## 3 Sensor Performance

### Crystalline Silicon Sensors

For tests of the sensor performance, we used a diffraction limited Gaussian beam with \(\lambda=1064\) nm produced by a diode-pumped 250 mW Nd:YAG laser with collimator optics. Alternatively, the laser beam was coupled into a single mode optical fiber with collimator optics which results in even better beam quality and stability.

The strip diodes are read out on each side via printed lines on two kapton fan-outs which were wire-bonded to the aluminum contact pads at each end of the strips (see Figure 4). Each of the 134 channels (two per strip) is read out individually via an electronics chain (see [10] for details) consisting of a current-voltage amplifier with very low input resistance, a high-pass filter, a line driver and an 11 bit CAMAC ADC. The laser beam was pulsed at about 1 kHz, synchronised with the readout, to suppress background light relative to the signal with the high-pass filter.

In the bending coordinate z of the ATLAS muon spectrometer, the strip position measurement will be used for alignment monitoring which gives the highest accuracy uniformly over the whole sensor area. The laser beam position \(\langle\)z\(\rangle\) is determined as the center-of-gravity of the signal strip positions \(\mathbf{z}_{i}\) weighted with the measured photo currents \(I_{i}\),

\[\langle\mathbf{z}\rangle=\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{N}\mathbf{z}_{i}I_{i}}{\sum_{i=1}^{ N}I_{i}}, \tag{3}\]

where \(N\) is the number of signal strips in the 2.7 mm diameter (2 \(\sigma\)) beam spot. The intrinsic position resolution depends on the signal-to-noise ratio \(\Delta I/\sum_{i}I_{i}\) and on geometrical factors including the strip pitch \(b=300\)\(\mu\)m and the number N of strips above threshold (\(N=6-8\)) which is to be optimised:

\[\Delta\mathbf{z}_{\mathrm{int}}=\frac{b\Delta I}{\sum_{i}I_{i}}\sqrt{\sum_{i= 1}^{N}[\frac{\mathbf{z}_{1}-\langle\mathbf{z}\rangle}{b}+i-1]^{2}}. \tag{4}\]

The photo current fluctuations \(\Delta I\) per strip are dominated by the uncertainty in the stability of the electronics calibration for the individual channels which is not larger than \(\pm 10\) nA. The current threshold for the evaluation of the weighted average was set at 300 nA, just above the ADC pedestals. The laser power was attenuated to 200 \(\mu\)W (saturation of the sensors starts at 500 \(\mu\)W) which corresponds to a maximum signal current on the central strip of about 2 \(\mu\)A. From equation (2), the local position resolution for a single measurement is determined to be better than \(\Delta\mathbf{z}_{\mathrm{int}}\approx 3\)\(\mu\)m. The statistical precision can be improved by averaging over several measurements.

In scans across the sensor surface, additional non-linearity errors in the position measurement with the strips have been observed. Figures 6 and 7 show the deviations of the position measurement according to equation (1) from the true position of the beam as a function of the true position. For a beam spot diameter of 2.7 mm, the non-linearity effects introduce typical systematic rms errors of \(\Delta\mathbf{z}_{\mathrm{lin}}\approx 15-25\)\(\mu\)m depending on the sensor. Two effects can be distinguished (see Figure 6).

The dominant uncertainty comes from the large scale fluctuations in the position measurement over distances larger than the beam diameter. The effect can be attributed to a two-dimensional non-uniformity in the sensor response. It is reproducible with high precision and specific for each sensor. Under the hypothesis of non-uniform sensitivity, the deviations in the position measurement should be in linear approximation proportional to the gradient of the sensitivity distribution at a given point on the surface and vary roughly with the square of the beam diameter [10]. This expectation is supported by simulations of the sensor response (see Figures 9-11) and confirmed by the measurements (Figure 6). According to the simulations, the effect corresponds to sensitivity variations on the order of 5% (see Figure 11).

Since the effect is reproducible with high precision, it can be corrected for each sensor. Two-dimensional scans of the sensor surfaces with a step size of \(0.5\leavevmode\nobreak\ \text{mm}\times 0.5\leavevmode\nobreak\ \text{mm}\) (see Figure 7) yield corrections (by interpolating between the scan points) with a residual rms uncertainty of \(\Delta\text{z}_{\text{lin}}^{\text{corr}}\approx 5-7\leavevmode\nobreak\ \mu\text{m}\) depending on the sensor (Figure 8). Reasons for the sensitivity variations could be fluctuations in the n doping concentration and therefore in the depletion depth or variations in the charge carrier lifetime. It may be possible to suppress the response fluctuations by increasing the depletion width with a sufficiently high reverse bias voltage; the sensitivity variations should disappear for fully depleted sensors. The present sensor prototypes with their very high depletion voltage (due to the low bulk resistivity) and the low breakdown voltage are, however, not designed for such a purpose. Possibilities of improving the sensor uniformity are being investigated in collaboration with CSEM.

On top of the larger scale variations one can see oscillations in the position response with a period equal to the strip pitch and amplitude of about 3 \(\mu\)m for 2.7 mm beam diameter. The amplitude of the oscillations decreases with increasing beam diameter (see Figures 6 and 9) and increases with the imposed current threshold (see Figure 11). The effect, which also depends on the shape of the beam profile, is quantitatively reproduced by the simulations. It is a consequence of the simple position estimate of equation (1) and can be understood in terms of the asymmetry introduced in the tails of the measured beam profile due to the signal current threshold.

The oscillations in the position determination can be suppressed by detecting them with the measured beam spot asymmetry which shows correlated oscillations. Estimating the beam position by fitting an assumed beam profile to the photo current distribution also suppresses the asymmetry effect, however, at the cost of a possible bias due to incomplete knowledge of the beam profile. Such corrections are not yet included in the non-linearity corrections so that the above residual systematic uncertainty in the position still contains contributions from the oscillation effect. The fact that the oscillations can be resolved in the measurements shows that the intrinsic position resolution must be better than a micron which is consistent with the digitisation error.

The second coordinate y is determined by current division reading out the strips on both sides and measuring the asymmetry in the photo currents \(I_{L}\) and \(I_{R}\). For external resistances much smaller than the strip resistance, the beam position y is determined from the current asymmetry according to

\[\frac{I_{L}-I_{R}}{I_{L}+I_{R}}=1-\frac{2\mathrm{y}}{L}, \tag{5}\]

where \(L=20\) mm is the length of the strips. The intrinsic resolution of the analog current division measurement is limited by the signal-to-noise ratio and increases towards the ends of the strips:

\[\Delta\mathbf{y}_{\mathrm{int}}=L\cdot\frac{\Delta I}{I}\sqrt{\frac{I_{L}^{2}+ I_{R}^{2}}{(I_{L}+I_{R})^{2}}}, \tag{6}\]

where \(I=I_{L}+I_{R}\). The present current threshold of 300 nA limits the measurement range to an area 3 mm away from the ends of the strips. The digitisation error in the current measurement alone leads to uncertainties of \(\Delta\mathbf{y}_{\mathrm{stat}}\approx 7-9\)\(\mu\)m. The maximum calibration uncertainty of \(\pm 10\) nA corresponds to upper limits on the errors of \(\Delta\mathbf{y}_{\mathrm{int}}\approx 60-75\)\(\mu\)m.

In addition there are deviations from linearity in the position measurement due to fluctuations in the strip resistivity. In the central \(10\times 10\) mm\({}^{2}\) area of the sensors, the non-linearity rms error per strip is \(\Delta\mathbf{y}_{\mathrm{lin}}\approx 20\)\(\mu\)m. This effect is reproducible and specific for each detector and can therefore be corrected if necessary. The independent current division measurements on individual strips can be averaged to reduce the statistical errors.

Operation of the sensors in a magnetic field can cause a shift of the charge distribution collected by the strips due to Hall drift of the charge carriers in crossed electric and magnetic fields. The effect is maximum if the magnetic field is perpendicular to the sensor's internal drift field and parallel to the strips. The shift increases with the mobility of the charge carriers and with the drift distance. Holes, which are collected on the p\({}^{+}\) strips, have an about 5 times smaller Hall mobility in c-Si than electrons. Since the depletion zone of the unbiased sensors is only 1 \(\mu\)m and the whole sensitive region only on the order of 20 \(\mu\)m deep, the bias is below one micron even in a 2 T magnetic field and does not affect the position measurement.

### Amorphous Silicon Sensors

With the amorphous silicon photodiodes, the beam position measurement in both co-ordinates is performed with strips using equations (1) and (2). For tests of the sensor performance, a diffraction limited Gaussian laser beam at 690 nm wavelength was used. It is produced by a 15 mW silicon laser diode glued to a single mode optical fiber with collimator optics. The laser power was attenuated to 60 \(\mu\)W which corresponds to a maximum signal current per strip of of about 4 \(\mu\)A. The tests were performed with the \(2\times 32\) channel sensor prototypes of Heimann Optoelectronics with accompaning readout electronics. The analog current signals are multiplexed, amplified by two current-voltage converters for alternating strips on each side and digitised by a single ADC.

The linearity of the position measurement in both coordinates is shown in Figure 12 together with a simulation of the sensor response. Oscillations in the position measurement are observed with period equal to the strip pitch (400 \(\mu\)m) which are of the same origin as the oscillations observed for the crystalline silicon sensors. With a beam diameter of 1.8 mm and a current threshold per strip of 1% of the peak (above the background and noise level), the amplitudes of the oscillations are already less than 4 \(\mu\)m with rms widths of 1.8 \(\mu\)m and 2.3 \(\mu\)m for the strip coordinates at the top and bottom of the active a-Si layer, respectively. They will become even smaller with larger beam diameter. The intrinsic position resolution must be still significantly better so that the oscillations can be resolved. According to the simulations, the oscillations can be suppressed to below the micrometer level by measuring the correlated oscillations in the observed beam spot asymmetry and applying corrections.

In contrast to the crystalline silicon detectors, the amorphous silicon sensors show no variations in photosensitivity. This can be attributed to the fact that the \(\leq 1\)\(\mu\)m thick a-Si film is sensitive over its full depth.

The a-Si sensor resolution does not degrade when operating them even in the strongest magnetic fields. Since the charge carrier mobility in amorphous silicon is low (\(10^{-2}-10^{-3}\frac{\mathrm{cm}^{2}}{\mathrm{Vs}}\) for electrons and on the order of \(10^{-4}\frac{\mathrm{cm}^{2}}{\mathrm{Vs}}\) for holes[11]) and drift distances to the electrodes are small in the thin a-Si film, shifts of the measured charge distributions by the Hall effect are completely negligible in both coordinates.

## 4 Optical Aberrations

Optical refraction of the laser beam when traversing the silicon sensors was identified as the most important systematic disturbance for the precision of the straightness monitors. The refractive index of silicon for infrared light of 1064 nm is rather large, n = 3.58. Two effects contribute to aberrations of the beam. Unavoidable small wedge angles \(\varepsilon\) between the two surfaces of the sensors lead to beam deflections by angles \(\delta\approx(\mathrm{n}-1)\varepsilon\) which cause systematic shifts in the beam position increasing linearly with distance from the traversed sensor. For non-normal incidence, even on exactly parallel surfaces, the finite thickness \(d\) of the detectors causes parallel displacement of the beam. The displacement increases with the angle \(\alpha\) relative to normal incidence, approaching a value of \(d\) for \(\alpha=90^{\circ}\).

In addition, density fluctuations in the air due to temperature gradients can cause deflections of the beam and distortions of the beam profile. This effect, which is common to all optical alignment methods, will eventually have to be controlled but has not been studied yet.

Deflections of the infrared laser beam by the sensor material have been measured at normal incidence using a setup of two closely spaced single-sided strip sensors with orthogonal strip directions at short relative distance. This allows very precise measurements with the intrinsic sensor resolution of small relative position shifts which are below the scale of the sensitivity variations (much larger than the strip pitch). Beam deflections between the first and the second sensor at normal incidence are negligible because of the small distance between them.

Figure 13 shows a measurement of beam refraction due to the wedge angle effect. The sensor has been rotated around the orthogonal beam axis by \(360^{\circ}\); deviations from the incident direction have been measured at two distances behind the deflecting sensor. The nicely reproduced sinoidal behavior demonstrates the sensitivity of the method for studying

the surface effects. The increase of the amplitude with distance from the deflecting sensor supports the interpretation by the wedge effect. The effect of possible deviations from normal incidence is too small to be resolved. Deflections for larger entrance angles can be predicted from the normal-incidence measurements. While Figure 13 refers to one point on the surface of the tested sensor, different wedge angles have been measured at other points on the surface indicating surface roughness.

Even after the polishing of both sensor surfaces, a residual surface roughness is remained. Maximum deflections of the beam on the order of 100 \(\mu\)rad have been found, corresponding to local wedge angles of \(\varepsilon\leq 40\)\(\mu\)rad. The rms widths of the deflection distributions vary between 16 and 26 \(\mu\)rad for different sensors.

Scans of the sensor surfaces in \(0.7\)\(\mathrm{mm}\times 0.7\)\(\mathrm{mm}\) grids have been used to interpolate and correct for the optical deflections at every point on the surface. The remaining rms uncertainty is \(3-5\)\(\mu\)rad depending on the sensor (see Figures 14 and 15). Interpolation in a \(0.5\)\(\mathrm{mm}\times 0.5\)\(\mathrm{mm}\) scan grid improves the precision of the corrections to remaining uncertainties of \(2-3\)\(\mu\)rad depending on the sensor. The measured beam deflections are specific for each sensor and reproducible with high precision. For a laser beam traversing several sensors, uncertainties from the independent deflection corrections for the all sensors between the first and the last one have to be combined quadratically.

The performance of a straightness monitor consisting of 3 silicon strip sensors has been tested by measuring the sagitta \(\mathrm{s}=[\frac{1}{2}(\mathrm{z}_{1}+\mathrm{z}_{3})-\mathrm{z}_{2}]\) of a laser beam. A 4 m long granite table with surface flatness better than 3 \(\mu\)m serves as absolute reference. The 3 sensors were precision mounted, thermally decoupled via thin ceramic holders, on polished steel frames and placed on the table at 1.6 m relative distance. With this configuration, the strip positions of each sensor are defined vertically to \(\pm 1\)\(\mu\)m relative to the surface of the table.

Applying corrections for non-linearity of the 3 sensors and for beam refraction by the middle sensor, based on a 0.5 mm\(\times\)0.5 mm surface scan, the vertical sagitta of the Nd:YAG laser beam has been measured with strips for various entrance points distributed randomly over the whole sensor surface. To determine the two-dimensional beam position on the middle sensor for the deflection correction, the second coordinate parallel to the table has been measured by current division with sufficient precision (compared to the scale of the deflection variations). Figure 16 shows how the deflection corrections shift the sagitta distribution to center around zero and how the non-linearity corrections reduce the width of the distribution. The mean of the sagitta distribution shifts from \(-81.2\)\(\mu\)m to \(-0.77\)\(\mu\)m after deflection corrections and to \(-0.14\)\(\mu\)m after adding sensor non-linearity corrections. The rms width changes from initially 83.5 \(\mu\)m to 16.4 \(\mu\)m and 7.1 \(\mu\)m, respectively. The error after all corrections is in agreement with expectation from the individual contributing uncertainties.

It has been demonstrated that the optical aberrations of the laser beam when passing through the silicon sensors can be corrected for by using a fine enough surface scan. Characterisation of the individual sensors with respect to non-linearity and deflections can be done quickly and to the desired precision with an automatised scanning procedure. The robustness of the alignment monitor would, however, benefit, if sensor and position dependent corrections can be avoided. The amorphous silicon sensors offer opportunitiesin this direction since they show negligible non-linearity and can be deposited on optically polished glass substrates. Tests with polished glass plates indicate that beam deflections are indeed small enough so that corrections are not necessary (see Figure 17). We are also investigating possibilities of obtaining silicon wafers with better than standard surface quality. Comparison of double-sided polished wafers from different sources indicate, however, that the surface planarity of the c-Si sensors is already near the achievable limit.

## 5 Light Distribution by Optical Fibers

The alignment system of the ATLAS muon spectrometer will consist of several hundred laser beams connecting the corners of the chambers[12]. The light from only a few lasers can be economically distributed to the individual straightness monitors by an optical fiber network. The laser light is coupled into a single mode fiber which feeds the light into many output fibers via commercially available fiber splitters or fiber switches. The collimator optics at the ends of the fibers can be easily mounted on the chambers. Alternatively, small laser diodes could also be directly attached to the chambers. All fiber optics components, couplers, splitters or switches and collimator lens systems for single mode fibers, have been succesfully tested for \(\lambda=1064\) nm and fulfill the specifications.

## 6 Conclusions

A novel optical alignment monitoring system has been developed for the ATLAS muon spectrometer. With the large measurement range of \(2\times 2\) cm\({}^{2}\) or more over large distances with diffraction limited laser beams and with the capability to connect multiple stations along one beam, the system is optimised for the alignment of extended structures and provides economical solutions for a wide range of alignment problems.

Two types of custom-designed semi-transparent optical sensors have been tested. Crystalline silicon strip photodiodes of \(300\)\(\mu\)m thickness achieve transmission rates of \(72\%\) in the infrared at \(1064\) nm and position uncertainties in the strip coordinate of better than \(7\)\(\mu\)m rms, after non-linearity corrections. Optical refraction of the laser beam when traversing the sensors is an important source of systematic uncertainty for high precision straightness monitoring, in particular over long distances. This effect can be corrected to a level of \(2-3\)\(\mu\)rad rms by scanning the sensor surfaces. Transmission rates in the \(80-90\%\) range can be achieved by thinning the sensor material; details still have to be investigated.

For amorphous silicon strip sensors with \(<0.5\)\(\mu\)m a-Si films transmission rates of about \(80\%\) can be reached at \(690\) nm with antireflecting glass substrate and proper optical matching of the sensor layers. Position errors of only \(1.5\)\(\mu\)m rms in both orthogonal strip coordinates have been achieved with no corrections required.

The amorphous silicon strip sensors offer several advantages. They provide robust two-dimensional position measurement with strips. High precision position measurement in the micrometer range in both coordinates can be achieved without the need for calibration. Test measurements showed that corrections for optical refraction of the laser beam can be avoided or considerably relaxed by using polished glass substrates for the sensors. Hightransmission rates can be achieved with visible light and relatively cheap laser diodes. The crystalline silicon sensors have a potential for even higher light transmittance without loss in sensitivity by reducing the sensor thickness after processing.

Both tested sensor types fulfill the requirements for the alignment of the ATLAS muon spectrometer. Further improvements of both technologies are in progress.
