## 1 Introduction

One of the main difficulty of the \(H\to\gamma\gamma\) analysis is to reduce the background from fake photons to a level significantly below the irreducible background from direct di-photon production. To achieve this goal, it is well known that a very good rejection against jets is required [1][2][3]. From the DC1 studies of photon-jet separation [4], it was found that the dominant contribution from fake background arises from photon+jet production, with one photon correctly identified and the jet faking a photon. This contribution is larger than the di-jet background with two fake photons, mostly because quark initiated jet (dominant in the photon+jet sample) are more difficult to reject than gluon initiated jet (dominant in the di-jet sample). In the past, fake background in the \(H\to\gamma\gamma\) analysis was estimated applying to di-jet or photon-jet events a parameterisation of the rejection derived from inclusive jet samples. As the rejection is \(E_{T}\) dependent, and is different for quark-initiated and gluon-initiated jets, the uncertainties in this procedure may be not negligible. In this note, we attempt at computing directly the background from photon-jet events by fully simulating a large sample of events and applying all the analysis cuts. Thus, we can estimate the (dominant) fake background without relying on a parameterisation.

This note is organised as follows: The event samples used for this simulation are discussed in section 2. Photon identification cuts are described in section 3. Section 4 shows the effect of explicit isolation cut. Section 5 presents the results for the photon efficiency and the fake background under the Higgs signal.

In all this note, "fake" photon cluster always mean a photon candidate not matched to a photon from the generated events coming either from the hard process or from a quark bremsstrahlung (the latter contribution is usually considered as part of the "irreducible" background). Clusters matched to photons from \(\pi^{0}\) decays are obviously considered as "fake".

In all the following, no distinction is made between converted and un-converted photons. In principle, using different cuts for converted and un-converted photons and addinga E/p cut for converted photons should increase a little bit the jet rejection.

## 2 Event Samples

The photon-jet sample has been generated with Pythia, using standard Rome generation settings (including underlying event tuning)1. The two hard processes \(q\bar{q}\to\gamma g\) and \(qg\to\gamma q\) are switched on, with a cut on the hard-scatterring \(p_{t}\)\(>\)30 GeV. This gives a resulting cross-section from Pythia of 5\(\cdot\)10\({}^{4}\) pb.

Footnote 1: The pythia version is 6.226, the Atlas settings can be found from the jobOptions in the package Generators/GeneratorOptionsRome

By far, the dominant contribution arises from the \(qg\to\gamma q\) process, which contributes to \(\approx 90\%\) of the cross-section. The final state being most of the time a quark-initiated jet, the typical rejection in this sample is expected to be smaller than the one observed in inclusive jets.

The "standard" particle level filter applied for e-gamma identification studies in jet has been applied, but for this sample, two objects are required to fulfill the filter: there must be at least two regions of size \(\Delta\eta\times\Delta\phi=0.12\times 0.12\) in which the summed transverse energy of all stable particles except muons and neutrinos is at least 23 GeV, within a \(\eta\) range of \(\pm 2.6\). This filter keeps 24% of the generated events which are then fully simulated.

The full simulation was done with athena-Geant4, 9.0.3 version with the Rome geometry layout (the muon system was not simulated).

Pile-up was added using Pythia Minimum-Bias events simulated under the same condition. An average of 4 events per bunch-crossing for the pile-up was used, corresponding to a luminosity of \(\approx\) 2\(\cdot\)10\({}^{33}\) cm\({}^{-2}\)s\({}^{-1}\). Calorimeter electronic noise and cross-talk were included in the digitisation.

The reconstruction was performed with the same athena version (9.0.3), without muon. Ntuples with the complete truth information, tracking and e/gamma informations were produced and used for the analysis.

A total of 10\({}^{6}\) events were generated. This corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 20 pb\({}^{-1}\). For a background level equal to the irreducible background, this would lead to 10 events in the mass bin used to collect the Higgs signal at a mass of 120 GeV.

## 3 Photon Identification cuts

The photon identification is based on the "traditional" [3] variables that were also used in the DC1 photon-jet separation study [4]:

* Hadronic leakage in the first hadronic compartment beyond the EM cluster
* Variables in the 2nd sampling of the EM calorimeter
* Shower width in \(\eta\)
* Ratio of energies in 3x7 cells (in \(\eta\)-\(\phi\)) and 7x7 cells.
* Ratio of energies in 3x3 cells and by 3x7 cells.
* Shower shape in the strips (first compartment of the EM calorimeter)
* Width in \(\eta\)
Energy outside the core of the shower: (E(\(\pm\)3 strips)-E(\(\pm\)1 strips)) divided by E(\(\pm\)1 strips) (Fracm variable)
* Search for a second maximum
* Cut on energy of second maximum
* Cut on difference between second maximum and minimum between the two maxima (DeltaE variable)

Different cuts are applied as a function of \(\eta\) and \(E_{T}\). The \(\eta\) regions used are: 0-0.8, 0.8-1.37, 1.52-1.8, 1.8-2.0, 2.0-2.37 (the \(\eta\) regions without fine segmentation in the first compartment are removed, the barrel-endcap crack is also removed with these cuts). For the results shown here, the small \(\eta\) range from 1.86-1.88 has been removed because of a bug now fixed in the strip shower shape computations. The \(E_{T}\) regions are the following: \(<\)30 GeV, 30-40 GeV, 40-50 GeV, \(>\)50 GeV.

A simple optimization of the cuts was performed, using for the efficiency determination the cluster matched to the photon from the hard process and for the rejection the clusters not matched to a photon from the hard process or from a quark bremsstrahlung.

As an example, Figure 1 shows the distribution of some variables in a particular \(\eta\)-\(E_{T}\) bin.

Overall, the shower shapes are not very different from what was found in the DC1 simulation, although some small differences can be observed for instance in the strip shower shapes (cf Figure 2).

The details of the cuts used as well as the e/gamma variables can be found in the appendix.

Figure 1: _Examples of shower shapes in the second and first sampling for \(\eta\)\(<\)0.8 and 30\(<\)\(E_{T}\)\(<\)40 GeV. True photons are shown in red and Fakes in blue. The bottom plots for the first sampling are after cuts on the second sampling shower shapes._

Figure 3 shows the resulting efficiency for the direct photons. In the simple tuning done here, the efficiency is slightly rising with \(E_{T}\) (which may be good for the overall sensitivity of the Higgs analysis [5]).

To compare with previous studies, the \(\pi^{0}\) rejection is computed starting from clusters fulfilling the cuts on the 2nd sampling and which are consistent with coming from only a single \(\pi^{0}\) (Elcluster and E(\(\pi^{0}\)) equal within \(\pm 15\%\)). The rejection given by the cuts on the strips is illustrated in Figure 4. For \(E_{T}\approx 50\) GeV, the "isolated" \(\pi^{0}\) rejection is around 3.5. This is consistent with the dedicated photon-\(\pi^{0}\) separation studies [6]. It has to be remembered that the cut optimization for the jet rejection is not exactly the same as for the \(\pi^{0}\) rejection, but this shows that the cuts we used are reasonable.

After the above cuts, the fake contribution is slightly larger than the "irreducible" contribution from photon arising from quark bremsstrahlung, as illustrated in Figure 5: The contribution of fake only shown in blue in this figure is more than half the fake+quark bremsstrahlung total rate shown in red. As expected and as observed in the DC1 studies, the fake background contribution is dominated by high-\(p_{T}\)\(\pi^{0}\) contribution2.

Footnote 2: As an additionnal cross-check of the effect of the recently reported G4 bug creating ”high” energy photons from low energy neutrons, we checked for each cluster candidate the energy of generated particles in a 0.2 cone around the cluster. Less then 2% of the selected clusters have no matched generated energy. Note that, since our simulation includes pile-up and generated particles for the pile-up events are not saved, this is only an upper limit of the effect of the G4 bug.

## 4 Photon Isolation

As discussed in the DC1 study, photon isolation is likely to be useful to improve the fake background rejection, especially at "low" luminosity. For the study presented here, two different isolation techniques have been investigated:

* Calorimeter isolation: the standard variables computed in the e/gamma reconstruc

tion are used, with different cone sizes (0.3, 0.45, 0.70)3. Footnote 3: This is the energy in all calorimeter cells inside the cone, removing the cells contributing to the photon candidate as implemented in the e/gamma reconstruction package. No noise suppression is applied.
* Track isolation: The sum of the \(p_{t}\) of the tracks in a 0.3 cone around the photon candidate is computed. As in the DC1 analysis, some care has been taken to remove from this variable the tracks arising from photon conversion: For tracks in a 0.1 cone, this additionnal selection is applied:
* \(p_{t}\) \(<\) 15 GeV
* Impact parameter \(<\) 0.1 mm
* No obvious partner to form a conversion candidate.A partner is a track of opposite sign, with a small separation in \(\eta\) and a small closest distance of approach in the transverse plane.

For this study, the track isolation variable has been found to be significantly more effective that the calorimeter cone isolation, and thus the calorimeter cone isolation has not been used further. But it should be noted that the variable that was available from this reconstruction for the calorimeter isolation is probably not the most optimized one, and it is likely that the calorimeter isolation could be significanly improved and eventually combined with the track isolation.

Figure 6 illustrates the track isolation variable for true photons and fake (after all identification cuts discussed above have been applied). One should notice that this distribution if the same for true converted and true unconverted photons, which means that the conversions have been succesfully removed by the primitive algorithm that we have used4. For a \(\approx\) 2% efficiency loss, the rejection increases by a factor close to 1.8 (for \(E_{T}\)\(>\)25 GeV) (with a cut at 4 GeV on the track isolation variable). One should keep in mind that this is achieved for 2.10\({}^{33}cm^{-2}s^{-1}\) pile-up level. This result is similar to what was seen in the DC1 analysis.

Footnote 4: A more refined algorithm to identify early conversions is now available in Athena and has been shown to work with reasonable efficiency [7].

## 5 Fake Background in the \(H\rightarrow\gamma\gamma\) analysis

The \(H\rightarrow\gamma\gamma\) analysis cuts have been applied to the gamma-jet sample, starting from reconstructed e/gamma candidates. The analysis includes both the photon identification cuts discussed above (with or without the track isolation cut) and the "standard" kinematical cuts:

* Max(pt1,pt2)\(>\)40 GeV
* Min(pt1,pt2)\(>\)25 GeV
* \(|\eta|\) in the range 0-1.37 or 1.52-2.37 for each photon

As a cross-check of the particle level filter, 5% of the generated events were fully simulated without the particle level filter applied. After cuts slightly looser than the ones used in the analysis, all the surviving events are in the filtered sample. The following results are based on the filtered sample.

Figure 7 shows the resulting mass distribution, at the generated gamma-jet level and after the selection, including or not the isolation cuts and the bremsstrahlung contribution.

Comparing the fake contribution after isolation cut to the generated distribution, a rejection factor of \(\approx\) 2000 is achieved. This average rejection is smaller than the average one measured in inclusive jet because of the much larger quark-initiated jet contribution in the \(\gamma\)-jet sample.

The remaining fake contribution to the background under a 120 GeV Higgs signal can be read directly from this figure (with or without isolation cut, excluding the bremsstrahlung contribution).

The following table shows the gamma-jet background rate from this brute-force simulation, compared to expectations from the fake background parameterisation from the DC1 studies and the irreducible background. It should be noted that the later background has been estimated at NLO using Diphox. Therefore, for a fair comparison, the gamma-jet background (normalised here with the Pythia LO cross-section) should probably be rescaled by a factor \(\approx\) 1.7.

\begin{tabular}{c c c} \multicolumn{3}{c}{\(\gamma\)-jet background d\(\sigma\)/dM (pb/GeV) at M=120 GeV (LO)} \\ \hline  & direct estimate & prediction from DC1 paramaterization \\ \hline before track isolation cut & 0.052\(\pm\)0.011 & 0.05 \\ after track isolation cut & 0.032\(\pm\)0.009 & 0.02 \\ \hline \multicolumn{3}{c}{\(\gamma\)-jet background d\(\sigma\)/dM (pb/GeV) at M=120 GeV (after K factor 1.7)} \\ \hline before track isolation cut & 0.088\(\pm\)0.019 & 0.09 \\ after track isolation cut & 0.054\(\pm\)0.015 & 0.03 \\ \hline \hline \multicolumn{3}{c}{\(\gamma-\gamma\) irreducible background (NLO)} \\ \hline  & 0.125 \\ \hline \end{tabular}

The obtained background from this study is consistent with the DC1 based expectations (this expectation takes into account the quark-gluon difference for the jet rejection

and applies a procedure to deconvolute correctly the \(E_{T}\) spectrum of the inclusive jets). This gamma-jet background is a factor two to three smaller than the irreducible one if the isolation cut is applied. It has to be kept in mind that the uncertainty on the reducible background is probably fairly large.

## 6 Conclusions

Using "standard" shower shape cuts, the dominant contribution of the fake background to the gamma-gamma Higgs search has been directly evaluated. After an additional isolation cut, this background has been estimated to be smaller than the irreducible one, in agreement with previous studies. There is certainly room to optimise further the identification cuts (for instance using more elaborate multivariate techniques) [8]. Some improvement should also be possible with a proper identification of photon conversions. One should however keep in mind that shower shapes in the data may not be identical to the MC expectations, and that a strategy to estimate directly from the data the photon purity should be elaborated.
