**Study of \(t\bar{t}b\bar{b}\) and \(t\bar{t}W\) background modelling for \(t\bar{t}H\) analyses**

The ATLAS Collaboration

This note presents Monte Carlo generator comparisons of the \(t\bar{t}b\bar{b}\) and \(t\bar{t}W\) processes at particle level. The aim is to compare the modelling of important backgrounds to \(t\bar{t}H\) measurements in multi-lepton final states and in the ttH(H\(\to\)\(b\bar{b}\)) decay channel and the treatment of the associated theory uncertainties for a combination of the full Run-2 \(t\bar{t}H\) results from ATLAS and CMS. As a first step, modelling and theory uncertainties as used in ATLAS are compared in the relevant analysis regions.

_Changes made on 18.7.22: changed name of Powheg-box-res to ttbb-Powheg as suggested by theorists to avoid confusion as the resonance-aware algorithm ("-res") is not applied for the ttbb predictions used here. The name is now consistent with the LHC Higgs WG note ([https://cds.cern.ch/record/2812088](https://cds.cern.ch/record/2812088)) Corrected pythia version numbers in Tab.1. Added a paragraph on recent developments in ttW theory._

## 1 Introduction

The search for Higgs boson production in association with a top quark pair (\(t\bar{t}H\)) in the \(H\to b\bar{b}\)[1; 2; 3; 4] and in multi-lepton final states [5; 6] analyses is limited by the modelling uncertainties of the main backgrounds, \(t\bar{t}b\bar{b}\) and \(t\bar{t}W\), respectively. Examples of tree-level diagrams of these processes are shown in Figure 1. A comparison of available Monte Carlo (MC) generators is thus performed to study modelling differences. Comparisons of observables are made at particle level, in a phase space similar to the reference measurements. The goal is to provide input to a discussion on a common strategy for ATLAS and CMS modelling uncertainties in the \(t\bar{t}H(b\bar{b})\) and \(t\bar{t}H\)(multi-lepton) analyses. Comparisons of \(t\bar{t}b\bar{b}\) distributions will be presented in Section 2 and of \(t\bar{t}W\) distributions in Section 3.

## 2 Comparisons of Monte Carlo predictions for the \(t\bar{t}b\bar{b}\) process

In the following section \(t\bar{t}b\bar{b}\) background predictions used by ATLAS in published and future analyses of \(t\bar{t}H(H\to b\bar{b})\) are compared. Several MC generator implementations where \(t\bar{t}b\bar{b}\) matrix elements are calculated at NLO with massive \(b\)-quarks1 using the four-flavour (4FS) scheme [7; 8] are used. The implementation in the Powheg-Box-Res framework [9; 10], referred to as \(t\bar{t}b\bar{b}\)-Powheg in the following, and matched to Pythia8[11] for parton shower, hadronization, multi-parton interaction and beam remnant, referred to as parton shower generator for short, is used as nominal prediction in ATLAS physics analyses based on the full Run-2 data set and referred to as PP8 \(t\bar{t}b\bar{b}\) in the following.

Footnote 1: “quarks” refers to both quarks and anti-quarks

In order to estimate systematic uncertainties ATLAS considers predictions with different settings of the Powheg internal parameter \(h_{\rm bzd}\) which regulates the splitting into the finite and the singular part of the real emission in the NLO calculation. In addition, set-ups of \(t\bar{t}b\bar{b}\)-Powheg matched to different parton shower generators are considered. Details of these samples are given in [12]. The dependence on the particular choice of generator and the NLO matching algorithm is studied by comparing to predictions of Sherpa 2.2.10 [13; 14; 15].

Finally, the uncertainties on the renormalization and factorization scales, \(\mu_{\rm R}\) and \(\mu_{\rm F}\), are estimated by varying them simultaneously in the matrix element (ME) by a factor 0.5 (2) around the nominal value. The dependence on the value of the strong coupling constant, \(\alpha_{s}\), in the initial and final-state radiation simulation of the parton shower (PS ISR, PS FSR) is estimated by varying them independently also by a factor two up and down, i.e. one scale is changed at a time while keeping the other parameters at their nominal value.

Figure 1: Examples of tree-level Feynman diagrams for \(t\bar{t}b\bar{b}\) (left) and \(t\bar{t}W\) (right).

The first Run-2 \(t\bar{t}H(H\to b\bar{b})\) analysis of ATLAS [1] used a partial data set and based the background predictions on inclusive \(t\bar{t}\) production with the matrix element calculated at NLO QCD with Powheg[9, 16, 17, 18, 19] employing a 5FS scheme and additional partons including \(b\)-quarks produced by the Pythia8 parton shower. The first full Run-2 \(t\bar{t}H(H\to b\bar{b})\) analysis [2] changed the nominal generator to PP8 \(t\bar{t}b\bar{b}\). However, it used a different set-up compared to the future analyses: the renormalization scale was set to two times the renormalization scale recommended to date by the LHC Higgs WG and the difference between the inclusive \(t\bar{t}\) samples was used to derive relative uncertainties which are attached to the nominal PP8 \(t\bar{t}b\bar{b}\) sample.

The studies presented here provide comparisons of the PP8 \(t\bar{t}b\bar{b}\) prediction with the variations considered to estimate uncertainties for future analyses and comparisons to the predictions used in the first full Run-2 \(t\bar{t}H(H\to b\bar{b})\) analyses. All comparisons are performed using stable final state particles in a fiducial phase space similar to the experimental measurements implemented in a dedicated routine in the Rivet analysis toolkit [20].

The section is organised as follows: in Sec. 2.1 describes the samples used for the comparison and the technical set-up of their generation. Section 2.2 describes the observables and the fiducial phase space used for the comparison and finally, Sec. 2.3 displays the resulting comparisons.

### MC generator set-ups

The set-ups used to generate \(t\bar{t}b\bar{b}\) predictions with \(t\bar{t}b\bar{b}\)-Powheg, Powheg, MG5_aMC@NLO and Sherpa are described in the following. The generator configurations and version numbers are summarised in Table 1 and their scale settings are given in Table 2. The systematic uncertainty estimates due to scale variations are summarised in Table 3.

The \(b\)-quark mass is set to \(4.75\,\mathrm{Ge\kern-1.0ptV}\) for Sherpa and to \(4.95\,\mathrm{Ge\kern-1.0ptV}\) for all other ATLAS samples. The top quark mass is assumed to be \(172.5\,\mathrm{Ge\kern-1.0ptV}\). The decay of the top quark is calculated by the corresponding generators (Powheg, Sherpa) respecting the spin correlation. The PDF sets are selected from the NNPDF3.0 family for all samples. The \(t\bar{t}b\bar{b}\)-Powheg and Powheg samples use EvtGen[21] for simulation of the \(B\)-hadron decays.

\(t\bar{t}b\bar{b}\)-Powheg samples:

Nominal \(t\bar{t}b\bar{b}\) predictions are calculated using the Powheg-Box-Res framework at NLO with massive \(b\)-quarks [10] with the "4FS NLO as 0118" PDF sets. The Powheg internal parameter \(h_{\mathrm{bzd}}\) is set to 5. The renormalization scale is set to the geometric average of the transverse mass of top- and \(b\)-quarks defined as \(m_{\mathrm{T},i}=\sqrt{m_{i}^{2}+p_{\mathrm{T},i}^{2}}\), where \(m_{i}\) refers to the mass, \(p_{\mathrm{T},i}\) to the transverse momentum and \(i\) to the top or \(b\)-quark. The factorization scale is related to the average of the transverse mass of the outgoing partons in the matrix element calculation, see Table 2. The Pythia8 parameters for parton shower and hadronization modelling are set to the A14[22] tune. These samples are referred to as PP8 \(t\bar{t}b\bar{b}\) samples.

For the \(h_{\mathrm{bzd}}\) variation, the parameter \(h_{\mathrm{bzd}}\) is set to 2 in \(t\bar{t}b\bar{b}\)-Powheg. For the parton shower variations, the set of LHE files which store the results of the matrix element calculation by \(t\bar{t}b\bar{b}\)-Powheg for the PP8 sample are used and matched to a different parton shower prediction. For the prediction with Pythia8 dipole shower only the treatment of the recoil of the radiated parton in the shower is changed and all other parameters are kept as the A14 tuned values. Another sample is produced where Herwig7 is used with the default tune provided with this generator version.

The \(t\bar{t}b\bar{b}\)-Powheg samples were calculated using a special option where virtual corrections are switched off and then reweighted with virtual corrections switched on2.

**Sherpa \(t\bar{t}b\bar{b}\) samples:**:

A Sherpa \(t\bar{t}b\bar{b}\) sample was generated using Sherpa version 2.2.10 [13, 14, 15]. The \(t\bar{t}b\bar{b}\) matrix elements were calculated with massive \(b\)-quarks at NLO, using the COMIX [23] and Openloops [15] matrix element generators, and merged with the Sherpa parton shower, tuned by the authors [24]. The same renormalization and factorization scales and PDFs are used as for the PP8 \(t\bar{t}b\bar{b}\) prediction.
**Inclusive \(t\bar{t}\) samples:**:

The inclusive \(t\bar{t}\) samples are generated with the Powheg v2 NLO event generator [9, 16, 17, 18, 19] and MG5_aMC@NLO+Pythia8 using a five-flavour (5FS) scheme. The renormalization and factorization scales were set to the average transverse mass of the top quark and antiquark.

For the Powheg samples, the \(h_{\rm damp}\) parameter3 was set to the 1.5 times the top quark mass. One sample is generated with the parton shower and hadronization modeled by Pythia8 with the same versions and settings as for the PP8 \(t\bar{t}b\bar{b}\) sample above. Another sample is generated using Herwig7 for the parton shower and hadronization. The Powheg \(t\bar{t}\) samples are filtered to contain only semi-leptonic and dileptonic \(t\bar{t}\) decays with exactly one or two leptons, respectively, within the fiducial volume as defined further below. These samples are referred to as PP8 \(t\bar{t}\) and PH7 \(t\bar{t}\) samples.

Footnote 3: The \(h_{\rm damp}\) parameter controls the \(p_{\rm T}\) of the first additional emission beyond the leading-order Feynman diagram in the PS and therefore regulates the high-\(p_{\rm T}\) emission against which the \(t\bar{t}\) system recoils.

The inclusive MG5_aMC@NLO+Pythia8 \(t\bar{t}\) sample uses the same scale settings and the same Pythia8 version as the PP8 \(t\bar{t}\) sample and is referred to as aMC+P8 \(t\bar{t}\) sample.

### Object reconstruction, observables and fiducial volume

The object and event selection applied in this comparison study is defined at particle-level. All objects are defined using stable final state particles with a mean lifetime of \(\tau>3\times 10^{-11}\) s. Jets are reconstructed from all stable final state particles (but excluding leptons and neutrinos from the top quark decay chain) using the anti-\(k_{\mathrm{t}}\) jet algorithm [25, 26] with a radius parameter of \(R=0.4\). Jets which contain at least one ghost-associated [27]\(B\)-hadron with transverse momentum (\(p_{\mathrm{T}}\)) of \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\geq 5\,\mathrm{GeV}\) are defined as \(b\)-jets, all other jets are considered "light" jets. The four-momentum of the bare leptons from top quark decay are modified ("dressed") by adding the four-momenta of all radiated photons within a cone of size \(\Delta R=0.1\). All objects are considered within pseudo-rapidity \(|\eta|\leq 2.5\) and with \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>27\,\mathrm{GeV}\) for leptons and \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>25\,\mathrm{GeV}\) for jets and \(b\)-jets.

Leptons are removed if they are separated from a jet by less than \(\Delta R=0.4\), where \(\Delta R=\sqrt{(\Delta\eta)^{2}+(\Delta\phi)^{2}}\). Events are selected with at least four \(b\)-jets, and further separated into two analysis regions: events with exactly one lepton and at least six jets (single lepton channel) and events with exactly two leptons and at least four jets (dilepton channel).

A set of observables relevant for the \(t\bar{t}H(H\to b\bar{b})\) analysis is studied within this fiducial phase space. All observables are studied for both the single lepton and the dilepton channel, however only the variables listed in Table 4 are shown in the following figures, as no significant qualitative difference is observed between the different top quark decay channels.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{l l l} \hline \hline Variable & Description & Channel \\ \hline \(\Delta R^{\mathrm{min}\Delta R}_{pb}\) & \(\Delta R\) of the two \(b\)-jets in the event which are closest in \(\Delta R\) & dilepton \\ \(m^{\mathrm{min}\Delta R}_{pb}\) & Invariant mass of the two \(b\)-jets closest in \(\Delta R\) & dilepton \\ \(N_{\mathrm{jets}}\) & Number of jets in the event (all jet flavours) & dilepton \\ Light jet \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) & Transverse momentum of the light jets in the event & dilepton \\ \hline \(N_{b\text{-jets}}\) & Number of \(b\)-jets in the event & single lepton \\ \(H^{\mathrm{jets}}_{\mathrm{T}}\) & Scalar sum of \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) of jets in the event (all jet flavours) & single lepton \\ Leading \(b\)-jet \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) & \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) of \(b\)-jet with largest \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) in the event & single lepton \\ Fourth \(b\)-jet \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) & \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) of \(b\)-jet with fourth largest \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) in the event & single lepton \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}

### Results

Three sets of generator predictions are compared on the observables given in Table 4 as follows. All comparisons are performed with respect to the PP8 \(t\bar{t}b\bar{b}\) sample. The PP8 \(t\bar{t}b\bar{b}\) sample and the alternative predictions are normalised to an integral of 1, after all selections and in each histogram individually for a shape-only comparison. The scale uncertainty variations on PP8 \(t\bar{t}b\bar{b}\) are derived as listed in Table 3 and the differences are added in quadrature to form the shaded area displayed in the figures.

Figure 2 shows the nominal \(t\bar{t}b\bar{b}\) predictions compared to the nominal predictions used in the early Run-2 analyses. Significant differences between the PP8 \(t\bar{t}b\bar{b}\) predictions and the PP8 \(t\bar{t}\) predictions are observed in \(\Delta R^{\rm min\Delta{R}}_{b\bar{b}}\), the jet multiplicity and in the number of events with more than four \(b\)-jets.

In Figure 3, the nominal PP8 \(t\bar{t}b\bar{b}\) prediction is compared to all generator variations potentially considered for modelling uncertainty for the ATLAS \(t\bar{t}H(H\to b\bar{b})\) analysis, i.e. variations in Powheg-Box-Res and Pythia8 parameter settings as well as Sherpa as alternative generator. As already discussed in [12], the parameter \(h_{\rm bzd}\) has only a minor influence on the observables. Interestingly, predictions of Powheg-Box-Res matched to Pythia8 with dipole shower and matched to Herwig parton shower are similar and both show a significant decrease with respect to the nominal PP8 \(t\bar{t}b\bar{b}\) in the jet multiplicity and \(H_{\rm T}\). Sherpa differs up to 10-20 % in all distributions mostly towards the edges of the phase space. Differences are in jet kinematics and in particular increasing differences towards high values are observed for \(\Delta R^{\rm min\Delta{R}}_{b\bar{b}}>1.5\).

Finally, Figure 4 shows the distributions used to estimate the systematic modelling uncertainties of the first full Run-2 analysis by ATLAS [1]. The uncertainty on the \(t\bar{t}b\bar{b}\) PP8 prediction is estimated by assigning the relative difference between PP8 \(t\bar{t}\) and alternative \(t\bar{t}\) predictions listed in Table 1 to the \(t\bar{t}b\bar{b}\) prediction.

### Conclusions

Comparisons of generator predictions used by ATLAS in a typical phase space of the \(t\bar{t}H(H\to b\bar{b})\) measurement were presented. Two sets are used for comparison: the generators used in the most recent published analyses involving \(t\bar{t}\) inclusive predictions based on 5FS scheme to estimate uncertainties and the set of generators in the future effort using \(t\bar{t}b\bar{b}\) calculations at NLO based on the 4FS scheme.

The difference between the predictions exceeds the uncertainties from the scale variations both for the uncertainties considered in the published \(t\bar{t}H(H\to b\bar{b})\) analysis and for the future analyses. Smaller uncertainties due to the choice of parton shower and NLO generator are observed when estimating them based on \(t\bar{t}b\bar{b}\) ME predictions compared to the previously used \(t\bar{t}\) ME matched predictions.

These distributions will be used in a future comparison of theory uncertainties between ATLAS and CMS.

## 3 Comparison of MC predictions for the \(t\bar{t}W\) process

The CMS [6] and ATLAS experiments [5] measured the \(t\bar{t}H\) production cross section in multi-lepton final states which are primarily sensitive to the decays of H\(\to WW^{*}\), H\(\to\tau\tau\) and H\(\to ZZ^{*}\). The dominant background in these measurements stems from \(t\bar{t}W\) production. These measurements along with the recent CMS measurement of \(t\bar{t}W\) production [28] show some tension with the SM predictions. In order to describe this background, different theoretical predictions are used for the future and published measurements by ATLAS and will be described in the following.

In recent times there have been significant theoretical developments in \(t\bar{t}W\) modelling despite the challenges associated with calculations of \(t\bar{t}W\) with higher order corrections in the QCD, \(\alpha_{s}\), and EWK, \(\alpha\), couplings. Even at LO in \(\alpha_{s}\), complications arise because \(t\bar{t}W\) is a \(qq\)-initiated process in which the radiation of the \(W\)-boson from one of the initial state quarks polarises the incoming quark, making spin correlations all the more important [29]. Initial calculations of \(t\bar{t}W\) production at next-to-leading order (NLO) in QCD at fixed order [30] and later matched to a parton shower [31, 32, 33] were later augmented with NLO EWK corrections (of order \(\alpha^{2}\alpha_{s}^{2}\)) [34] to provide the higher order cross sections used across the LHC programme for a number of years [35]. Since then there has been significant theoretical progress in calculating more complex and precise predictions. Higher order QCD corrections including \(t\bar{t}W\) production with additional partons open gluon-initiated production modes with significant contributions to the total cross section. Recent studies show that these contributions also have large next-to-leading order (NLO) corrections [36] and that \(t\bar{t}W\ jj\) can be large [37], both of which require NLO-merged calculations [38] for such effects to be properly included. Furthermore, beyond the traditionally "leading" NLO EWK corrections (of order \(\alpha^{2}\alpha_{s}^{2}\)) there are even larger contributions from traditionally "sub-leading" NLO corrections (of order \(\alpha^{3}\alpha_{s}\)) [33, 39, 40] due to the existence of \(tW\) scattering contributions embedded in to the \(t\bar{t}Wj\) process. Calculations at NLO in QCD accounting for next-to-next-to-leading logarithmic effects (NNLL) are also available [41] as well as recent predictions at NLO+NNLL in QCD also with NLO EWK corrections [42, 43]. Full off-shell calculations at NLO in QCD [44, 45, 46] are also now available and more recently the NLO EWK corrections have also been incorporated [47] into these calculations, along with the development of procedures to apply the off-shell corrections to NLO+PS setups [48].

For future analyses, updated MC models will be used and the estimate of systematic uncertainty is under development. The latest setups tested by ATLAS are documented in the following. The use of other theoretical developments, already outlined, will also be considered in future but are beyond the scope of this document.

### MC generator set-ups

The nominal sample for inclusive \(t\bar{t}W\) production was generated using the Sherpa 2.2.10 [13, 49] generator with the NNPDF3.0 NLO PDF set. The matrix element (ME) was calculated for up to one additional parton at NLO and up to two partons at LO using Comix[23] and OpenLoops[15], and merged with the Sherpa parton shower [24] using the MEPs@Nlo prescription [50] with a merging scale of 30 GeV. The choice of renormalization and factorization scales is \(\mu_{\mathrm{R}}=\mu_{\mathrm{F}}=H_{\mathrm{T}}/2\), where \(H_{\mathrm{T}}\) is defined as the scalar sum of the transverse masses \(\sqrt{p_{\mathrm{T}}^{2}+m^{2}}\) of all final state particles. Detailed information of the Sherpa sample is listed in Table 5. Systematic uncertainties due to missing higher-order QCD corrections are estimated in the nominal sample by varying the factorization and renormalization scales together with \(\alpha_{s}\) in the parton shower by a factor of 0.5 (2.0) with respect to the central value.

In addition to this nominal prediction at NLO in the strong coupling a separate sample is produced which contains also higher order corrections relating to electroweak (EW) contributions. These are added in two ways. First, through event-by-event correction factors of the order \(\alpha^{3}\) and \(\alpha^{2}\alpha_{s}^{2}\) where \(\alpha\) (\(\alpha_{s}\)) refers to the EW (QCD) coupling constant. Secondly, sub-leading EW corrections at order \(\alpha^{3}\alpha_{s}\)[40] are introduced via the addition of an independent Sherpa 2.2.10 sample produced at LO in QCD for this final state. This sample is marked as "QCD+EW" in the following.

Uncertainties associated with the modelling of additional QCD radiation have been estimated by comparing the nominal \(t\bar{t}W\) prediction with that of an alternative sample that was generated at NLO with the MadGraph5_aMC@NLO 2.3.3[51] generator using the same scale choice as for the nominal sample and PDF set NNPDF3.0NLO, and interfaced to Pythia 8.210[11] in combination with the A14 tune [22].

A \(t\bar{t}W\) prediction was produced using the MadGraph5_aMC@NLO 2.9.3 program to generate \(t\bar{t}W\) production with up to one additional parton in the final state at NLO accuracy in the strong coupling. The renormalization and factorization scales are the same as in the nominal sample. The showering and subsequent hadronization is performed using Pythia 8.245[11] with the A14 tune [22]. The different jet multiplicities are merged using the FxFx NLO matrix-element and parton-shower merging prescription [52], see detailed description in [53].

The configurations of the samples are summarised in Table 5.

### Object reconstruction, fiducial volume and observables

Object and event selection is defined at particle-level that closely matches the detector-level described in reference [5] (ATLAS) and [6] (CMS). Jets are reconstructed from all stable final state particles with a mean lifetime of \(\tau>3\times 10^{-11}\) s (but excluding leptons and neutrinos from the top quark decay chain), using the anti-\(k_{t}\) algorithm with a radius parameter of \(R=0.4\). Jets are required to satisfy \(p_{\rm T}>\)25 GeV and \(|\eta|<\)2.5. Jets that are matched to a \(b\)-hadron4 by ghost matching [27] are referred to as \(b\)-jets. Electrons and muons, referred to as light leptons \(\ell\), are required to be separated from selected jets by \(\Delta R>0.4\) and are otherwise removed. Hadronically decaying \(\tau\) leptons are required to satisfy \(p_{\rm T}>\)25 GeV and \(|\eta|<\)2.5. Events are selected with exactly two light leptons. The four-momentum of the bare leptons from top quark decay are modified ("dressed") by adding the four-momenta of all radiated photons within a cone of size \(\Delta R=0.1\). Leptons are required to have \(|\eta|<\)2.5 and \(p_{\rm T}>\)25(20) GeV for leading \(\ell_{0}\) (subleading \(\ell_{1}\)) lepton (\(p_{\rm T}\) ordered). Leptons are required to have same charge, targeting the semi-leptonic \(\rm\bar{t}\bar{t}\) decay and leptonic \(W\) decay.

Footnote 4: no \(p_{\rm T}\) cut is applied

Events with at least 3 jets and at least one of them being a \(b\)-jet are considered in the fiducial volume. The object definition and event selection is summarised in Tables 6 and 7. These are then split into five regions, categorized by the number of jets of any flavour (three or \(\geq\)4), \(N_{b-\rm jets}\) (one or \(\geq\)2) as well as the presence of hadronically decaying \(\tau\) lepton, as summarised in Table 8.

The definitions of the regions are motivated by the \(t\bar{t}H\) Multilepton analysis strategy. Regions 1 and 2 corresponds to the signal regions5 and Regions 3 and 4 are used as control regions in the \(2\ell\) same-sign \(0\)-\(\tau_{had}\)\(t\bar{t}H\) channel. Definition of Region 5 is closely followed6 by the selections in the \(2\ell\) same-sign \(1\)-\(\tau_{had}\)\(t\bar{t}H\) channel.

Footnote 5: slightly different then in ref. [5], in order to define a common selection with the CMS Collaboration.

Footnote 6: requirement on jet multiplicity is relaxed.

The list of variables for the comparison of the \(t\bar{t}W\) generators presented in this note are summarised in Table 9.

### Results

The samples described in Table 5 are compared in the following. The ratio plots show the ratios of the all MC samples with respect to Sherpa, the shaded band represents scale variations. The same set of distributions are presented twice with different focus: in Sect. 3.3.1 shapes are compared and in Sect. 3.3.2 acceptance effects are studied.

#### 3.3.1 Shape comparison

In the following shape agreement between nominal and alternative generators will be presented, i.e. the distributions are normalised to the integral.

The modelling of jet kinematics are presented on Figure 5 for the high (Regions 1 and 2) and low (Regions 3 and 4) jet multiplicities. Significant differences between Sherpa and MG5_aMC@NLO+Pythia8 are observed which are not present for MG5_aMC@NLO+Pythia8 FxFx.

The lepton kinematics distributions are shown on Figure 7 representing Region 2. Overall, good agreement between all predictions is observed.

The distributions of the angular distance between the two leptons and the maximum of lepton's pseudorapidity separation between the leptons are presented in Figure 8 for Region 1 on the right and Region 2 on the left. Good agreement of the distributions is observed except for MG5_aMC@NLO+Pythia8.

Distributions of the jet multiplicity, number of \(b\)-jets, the leading lepton transverse momentum and the angular distance between the two leptons \(\Delta R_{\ell 0\ell 1}\) for the Region 5 with \(N_{\mathrm{T}_{\mathrm{had}}}=1\) selection are presented in Figure 9. In contrast to all other comparisons, the jet multiplicity prediction of MG5_aMC@NLO+Pythia8 with FxFX differs most from the other predictions in this region.

#### 3.3.2 Comparisons of predictions including acceptance effects

In the following section a comparison of the generators will be given in the fiducial phase space, i.e. the predicted distributions include acceptance effects. For this comparison, all distributions without EW corrections are normalised to match the total cross section value of \(\sigma_{tot}^{YR4}=\)600.8 fb as given in the Yellow Report 4 [35] for predictions without EW corrections. The distributions of Sherpa QCD+EW which are normalised to their generator cross section of 614.7 fb. The same set of distribution discussed in Section 3.3.1 are presented. In all distribution, a significant increase of scale uncertainties is observed, reaching up to 50% at high jet multiplicity. The observables related to jet multiplicity and \(H_{\mathrm{T}}\) show similar trends as in the shape comparisons, see Figure 10. Only the discrepancy of the jet multiplicity prediction in MG5_aMC@NLO+Pythia8 FxFx is significantly enhanced.

All distributions are normalised to YR4 cross section of 600.8 fb.

All distributions are normalised to YR4 cross section of 600.8 fb.

All distributions are normalised to YR4 cross section of 600.8 fb.

All distributions are normalised to YR4 cross section of 600.8 fb.

### Conclusion

The \(t\overline{t}W\) predictions of Sherpa and MG5_aMC@NLO+Pythia8 with different settings have been compared in regions and observables relevant for the measurement of \(t\overline{t}H\) in the multi-lepton final state. The normalised distributions sensitive to shape differences have very small scale uncertainties, below 10% in most of the phase space while these scale uncertainties are significant when the acceptance effects are included, i.e. the distributions are normalised to the \(t\overline{t}W\) cross section. The inclusion of tree-level EW effects only causes minor shape effects but can lead to up to 20% difference in cross section at high jet multiplicity. As expected including the FxFx algorithm into the MG5_aMC@NLO+Pythia8 prediction leads to significant effects in all regions, especially at low \(H_{\mathrm{T}}\). Overall, the differences between the different model predictions are mostly within the scale uncertainty band except at the edges of the phase space.

These distributions will be used as a starting point for future comparisons with CMS to derive a theory uncertainty model for a combination of the expected measurement results based on the full Run2 data set.
