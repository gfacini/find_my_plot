**Prospects for measuring Higgs pair production in the channel \(H(\to\gamma\gamma)H(\to b\bar{b})\) using the ATLAS detector at the HL-LHC**

The ATLAS Collaboration

Studies are presented on the prospects for the observation of Higgs pair production in the channel \(H(\to\gamma\gamma)H(\to b\bar{b})\) using an upgraded ATLAS detector, assuming a dataset comprising 3000 fb\({}^{-1}\) of 14 TeV proton-proton collisions at the High-Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC). Generator-level Monte Carlo events are used to perform this study, with parameterised efficiencies and resolution applied to approximate the expected performance of the upgraded ATLAS detector under HL-LHC conditions. After event selection, a signal yield of around 8 events is obtained for the Standard Model scenario, corresponding to a signal significance of 1.3 \(\sigma\).

Introduction

The ATLAS and CMS collaborations have recently reported the discovery of a Higgs boson with a mass of \(m_{H}\simeq 125\) GeV [1, 2]. The measurement of the Higgs boson self-coupling and subsequent reconstruction of the Higgs potential is crucial in order to confirm whether the Higgs boson discovered has the properties predicted in the Standard Model.

A direct measurement of the Higgs trilinear self-coupling \(\lambda_{HHH}\) requires the study of Higgs boson pair production. At hadron colliders, the dominant Higgs pair production mechanism is gluon fusion, with the other production mechanisms1 being more than an order of magnitude smaller [3]. For a centre-of-mass energy of 14 TeV, the production cross section of pairs of 125 GeV Higgs bosons is estimated to be 40.8 fb (with an error of \(\pm 8.5\%\) from QCD scale uncertainties and \(\pm 7\%\) from PDF+\(\alpha_{S}\)) [4, 5].

Footnote 1: vector boson fusion, higgsstrahlung, and associated production with \(t\bar{t}\).

The various decays of the Standard Model Higgs boson offer a variety of final states which can be studied, and the most interesting of these are given in Table 1, along with their branching ratios and the approximate event yield in the anticipated High-Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC) dataset corresponding to 3000 fb\({}^{-1}\).

The \(H(\to b\bar{b})H(\to\gamma\gamma)\) final state discussed in this note offers the potential for a clean HH signal extraction thanks to the narrow mass peak of the \(H\to\gamma\gamma\) decay. The low branching for this decay mode leads to low expected signal rates, so only the gluon-gluon production mode has been studied. The analysis documented in this note has been done using truth-level samples (i.e. 4-vectors describing the kinematics of the various physics objects) produced by the event generators described in Section 3.1, applying smearing functions in order to model the expected performance of the upgraded ATLAS detector at the HL-LHC. These smearing functions were obtained from fully simulated samples produced for various benchmark physics processes, with an average number of collisions per bunch crossing, \(<\mu>\), of around 140 [6, 7]. The high-luminosity conditions provide a challenging experimental environment, which will be mitigated as far as possible by improvements to the ATLAS detector design and technology, as described in Ref. [8].

This note focuses on the observation of Higgs boson pair production in the \(H(\to b\bar{b})H(\to\gamma\gamma)\) final state; a precise measurement of \(\lambda_{HHH}\) would need a combination of analyses from several decay channels, each with its own sensitivity to the effects of the Higgs self-coupling.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|} \hline Decay Channel & Branching Ratio & Total Yield (3000 fb\({}^{-1}\)) \\ \hline \(b\bar{b}+b\bar{b}\) & 33\% & 40,000 \\ \(b\bar{b}+W^{+}W^{-}\) & 25\% & 31,000 \\ \(b\bar{b}+\tau^{+}\tau^{-}\) & 7.3\% & 8,900 \\ \(ZZ+b\bar{b}\) & 3.1\% & 3,800 \\ \(W^{+}W^{-}+\tau^{+}\tau^{-}\) & 2.7\% & 3,300 \\ \(ZZ+W^{+}W^{-}\) & 1.1\% & 1,300 \\ \(\gamma\gamma+b\bar{b}\) & 0.26\% & 320 \\ \(\gamma\gamma+\gamma\gamma\) & 0.0010\% & 1.2 \\ \hline \end{tabular}

Higgs Self-Coupling Phenomenology

Higgs boson pair production from gluon fusion can be described at leading order (LO) by the Feynman diagrams shown in Figure 1. Only the diagram on the left hand side includes a contribution from the triple Higgs coupling, whereas in the case of the diagram on the right hand side the self-coupling constant does not play a role. Both diagrams contain fermionic loops and are dominated by the contribution from the top quark. There is a relative minus sign between the two contributions, resulting in destructive interference that effectively reduces the total Higgs pair production cross section in the Standard Model.

This effect can be seen in Figure 2 (left), where di-Higgs cross sections for different values of the self-coupling \(\lambda_{HHH}\) are shown, at LO, next-to-leading order (NLO), and next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO). A value of \(\lambda_{HHH}=0\) corresponds to the case where there is no self-coupling of the Higgs boson, and thus the amplitude of the left diagram in Figure 1 vanishes. For this case the cross section is enhanced by approximately a factor of two compared to the Standard Model [10, 11]. The cross section decreases with increasing values of the self-coupling up to a value of 2.44 times the Standard Model value (\(\lambda_{HHH}^{SM}\)) where the cross section is at its minimum. Figure 2 (right) shows that the cross-section is never zero. For larger values of \(\lambda_{HHH}\) the cross-section increases again. Due to the (approximately) parabolic shape of the cross-section, measuring only the total cross section for the pair production process does not allow the value of the self coupling constant to be inferred but the degeneracy could be removed by further measurements of its dependence on kinematical variables.

Figure 2 also shows that the differences between cross-section predictions at different order in pQCD are large. The NNLO values are used in the remainder of this note.

## 3 \(H(\to b\bar{b})H(\to\gamma\gamma)\) Analysis

Signal events will be selected by requiring that they contain at least two photons and two \(b\)-jets, and applying \(\mathrm{p}_{T}\), invariant mass and angular selection criteria. There are several processes which constitute irreducible backgrounds in this channel, since they include two real photons and two real \(b\)-jets in their final state. Those considered to be most important, and therefore selected for study are: \(b\bar{b}\gamma\gamma\), \(t\bar{t}H(\gamma\gamma)\), \(Z(b\bar{b})H(\gamma\gamma)\) and \(b\bar{b}H(\gamma\gamma)\). In addition to these irreducible backgrounds, significant reducible contributions are also possible from final states in which one or more objects are misidentified, such as a light flavour jet or \(c\)-jet being mis-identified as a \(b\)-jet, or an electron or light flavour jet (\(j\)) being misidentified as a photon. The possible contribution from each of these processes depends on the mis-identification probability ('_fake rate_') for each type of object. Therefore, based on the estimated magnitude of the various fake rates and the cross sections of the processes in question, those expected to make the most significant background contributions are: \(jj\gamma\gamma\), \(c\bar{c}\gamma\gamma\), \(b\bar{b}\gamma j\), \(t\bar{t}\) and \(t\bar{t}\gamma\). There may possibly be other final states which contribute at various levels; for example, in this analysis no explicit study has been made of the effect of additional objects from multiple interactions per bunch-crossing, such as \(b\)-jets (both fake and real) arising from pile-up collisions.

### Signal and Background Generation

Only the dominant gluon-gluon fusion production mode is included in the signal generation. Inclusive di-Higgs samples were obtained with Madgraph 5 [12], at LO (with finite top mass). Higgs decays and parton showering were generated using Pythia 8 [13]. The event yields were normalized to the NNLO cross-sections of Ref. [4] and [5] (using infinite top mass approximation). Events were produced with four different self-coupling strengths: \(\lambda_{HHH}=0\) corresponding to the case of no Higgs self interaction, \(\lambda_{HHH}=\lambda_{HHH}^{SM}\) corresponding to the Standard Model expection, and \(\lambda_{HHH}=2(10)\times\lambda_{HHH}^{SM}\) corresponding to a value twice (ten times) that of the Standard Model, see Table 2. Henceforth, the ratio \(\lambda_{HHH}/\lambda_{HHH}^{SM}\) will be referred to simply as \(\lambda/\lambda_{SM}\), and unless otherwise stated, the signal sample referred to in the text is that with \(\lambda_{HHH}=\lambda_{HHH}^{SM}\) or \(\lambda/\lambda_{SM}=1\). Additional signal Monte Carlo samples with \(\lambda/\lambda_{SM}=1\) were showered with Pythia 6 [14] in order to investigate the impact of different parton showering on the signal acceptance.

The background samples were generated using MadGraph 5 [15] and showered with Pythia 8, with the exceptions of \(t\bar{t}\) which was produced with MC@NLO [16] and JIMMY [17], \(Z(b\bar{b})H(\gamma\gamma)\) for which Pythia 8 was used for generation and showering, and \(t\bar{t}H(\gamma\gamma)\) which was generated using POWHEG [18]. The backgrounds \(b\bar{b}\gamma\gamma\), \(b\bar{b}\gamma j\), \(b\bar{b}jj\), \(c\bar{c}\gamma\gamma\) and \(jj\gamma\gamma\) were generated inclusively (e.g. an additional jet in the tree-level matrix element is allowed), with a \(\mathrm{p}_{T}\) threshold for jet/photon generation of 20 GeV. The underlying event effects are generated as part of the showering process but multiple parton interactions and pile-up are not included.

All of the Monte Carlo samples used can be found in Table 2, along with their cross sections (including filter efficiencies), the number of events produced, and the equivalent luminosity of the sample. The single-Higgs processes are normalized to the NNLO cross-sections, except ttH and bbH which are predicted only at NLO, as recommended by the LHC cross-section working group [19]. The cross sections of the non-Higgs background samples at LO are used2, with the exception of \(t\bar{t}\) which is scaled to match NNLO cross section calculations at 14 TeV [21]. These background samples are categorised according to the generated LO and LO plus extra jets matrix element processes, and so within the \(\gamma\gamma jj\) sample it is possible that there are, for example, significant contributions from \(b\) orquarks produced from gluon splitting during the showering process leading to some double counting of \(\gamma\gamma c\bar{c}\) and \(\gamma\gamma b\bar{b}\) events. In order to avoid double counting, overlap removal is applied by taking events containing at least 2 \(b\)-jets from the \(\gamma\gamma bb\) sample, 2 \(c\)-jets from the \(\gamma\gamma ccc\) sample, and the remaining events with less than 2 \(b\)-jets or 2 \(c\)-jets from the \(\gamma\gamma jj\) sample.

### Object Definitions

As discussed in Section 1, functions derived from full simulation samples are used to model the expected detector performance under HL-LHC conditions. For jets, anti-k\({}_{T}\) truth jets with a cone size \(R=0.4\) are used, formed from all truth particles with lifetime greater than 10 ps except muons and neutrinos. The transverse momentum of the jets is smeared by 10-25% using an \(\eta/p_{T}\)-dependent parameterization; the jets are requested to satisfy \(|\eta|<2.5\) and have a minimum \(p_{T}\) of 25 GeV. The identification of truth \(b\)-jets is done by finding jets with a truth \(b\)-hadron within a cone of \(\Delta R<0.4\) (\(\Delta R=\sqrt{\Delta\phi^{2}+\Delta\eta^{2}}\)) around the jet direction. The \(b\)-tagging performance for these jets is then modeled by applying a (p\({}_{T}\)/\(\eta\) dependent) efficiency function, at a working point corresponding to a mean efficiency of 70 %. A correction (referred to here as JES since it is similar to a detector-level Jet Energy Scale correction) was derived from the ratio of \(E_{T}^{\rm parton}/E_{T}^{\rm jet}\) to account for radiation of partons outside the jet cone and semi-leptonic b-hadron decays, which result in the \(b\)-jet mass distribution m\({}_{b\bar{b}}\) peaking significantly below the generated Higgs mass of 125 GeV. Following application of this correction to the truth jets, the most probable value of m\({}_{b\bar{b}}\) in signal improved from 113 GeV to 127 GeV, much closer to the expected value.

For photons, the energy and \(\eta/\phi\) directions are each smeared to model the expected resolution3. The photons must also be inside the acceptance region \(|\eta|<2.37\) and outside of the transition region \(1.37<|\eta|<1.52\). They are also required to be isolated with respect to any jets in the event; the photon must have no jets within an annulus \(0.1<\Delta R<0.4\), and any jets within \(\Delta R<0.1\) must have an energy within 15% to that of the photon. A p\({}_{T}\)/\(\eta\)-dependent function is applied to the photons to model the identification efficiency, with a plateau efficiency of 76%, which is reached for photons with p\({}_{T}>80\) GeV.

Footnote 3: The photon smearing functions have been updated with respect to those described in [7, 6] - in particular, the constant-\(\sigma\) smearing in \(\phi\) has been replaced with a smearing of 10 mrad/\(\sqrt{E[GeV]}\), and pile-up dependence has been added to the energy resolutions.

For leptons, an isolation requirement is also applied; in this case the lepton should have no \(p_{T}>10\) GeV jets within an annulus \(0.1<\Delta R<0.4\).

The fake rates for jet\(\rightarrow\)photon, light flavour jet\(\rightarrow\)\(b\)-jet and \(c\)-jet\(\rightarrow\)\(b\)-jet are provided by p\({}_{T}\)/\(\eta\) dependent functions derived from simulation, and are of the order 0.25%, 1% and 30% respectively. Concerning the electron\(\rightarrow\)photon fake rate under HL-LHC conditions, an electron to photon mis-identification probability of 2% in the barrel (\(|\eta|<1.37\)) and 5% in the endcap calorimeter (\(1.37<|\eta|<2.37\)) have been used, based on the assumption of maintaining the current level of performance.

Overlap removal is applied between the various object collections, to ensure that there is no unwanted duplication in the final-state objects used for analysis.

### Event Selection

This section outlines the development of the event selection. The selection has been designed to give close-to-optimal (under the previously described assumptions) significance for observing a Higgs pair production signal, by trying to maximise the value of \(S/\sqrt{B}\) where \(S\) and \(B\) are the total number of signal and background events selected. While overly tight selection criteria may preferentially reduce the contribution of the self-coupling diagram, the selection presented below is a trade-off between HH-events acceptance and sensitivity to the self-coupling effects shown in Figure 1 optimized for \(\lambda_{HHH}\sim\lambda_{HHH}^{SM}\).

The kinematic distributions for the Standard Model signal and a subset of background processes for events containing at least two isolated photons and at least two \(b\)-jets are shown in Figures 3-5, demonstrating the difference in the signal and background shapes. Note that the \(b\bar{b}\gamma j\), \(c\bar{c}\gamma\gamma\) and \(jj\gamma\gamma\) processes are omitted in these figures since \(b\bar{b}\gamma\gamma\) is a good representative of all these QCD continua which have similar kinematics.

#### 3.3.1 m\({}_{\gamma\gamma}\) and m\({}_{b\bar{b}}\) signal window

The m\({}_{\gamma\gamma}\) (m\({}_{b\bar{b}}\)) optimal windows are found to be 123-128 GeV (respectively 100-150 GeV). The sensitivity does not depend strongly on the m\({}_{bb}\) window once the JES correction is applied.

#### 3.3.2 p\({}_{T}\) Thresholds

The p\({}_{T}\) optimisation was performed by cutting on the p\({}_{T}\) of each of the two \(H(\rightarrow\gamma\gamma)\) and \(H(\to b\bar{b})\) candidates while keeping the initial leading/subleading p\({}_{T}\) thresholds (40/25 and 30/30 GeV for \(b\)-jets and photons respectively) for the final state objects. The optimal selection criteria for the lower thresholds on the boost of the Higgs candidates are found to be p\({}_{T}^{b\bar{b}}>110\) GeV and p\({}_{T}^{\gamma\gamma}>110\) GeV.

It should be noted that such selection criteria on the combined \(b\overline{b}\)/\(\gamma\gamma\) systems may not be optimal from the point of view of pile-up jet contamination of events, since it allows the possibility of one very high-\(\mathrm{p}_{T}\) jet from the primary background process being paired with a soft jet from pile-up. This effect is expected to be reduced when using jets within the tracking acceptance only; this should be investigated in future studies with a more detailed modeling of pile-up effects.

#### 3.3.3 Angular Cuts

Cuts on the angular separation of the Higgs decay products were applied: \(\Delta R^{b\overline{b}}>0.4\), \(0.4<\Delta R^{\gamma\gamma}<2.0\) and \(\Delta R^{\gamma b}>0.4\) where \(\Delta R^{\gamma b}\) is the minimum separation between a photon and \(b\)-jet. These selection criteria are taken from Ref. [22], where they were used in order to give the optimum separation between the signal and the \(b\overline{b}\gamma\gamma\) continuum background4. Optimisation studies, performed here on a wider range of backgrounds than in Ref. [22], show that further tightening of the \(b\)-jets separation cut to \(\Delta R^{b\overline{b}}<2.0\)further improves the \(S/\sqrt{B}\), and so this selection criteria is also applied.

#### 3.3.4 Additional Selection Criteria

Two further selection criteria are also applied as part of the \(H(\to b\bar{b})H(\rightarrow\gamma\gamma)\) event selection, primarily to reduce the contribution from backgrounds involving \(\vec{t}\). The number of jet (N\({}_{j}\)) is required to be less than six; the jet multiplicity distributions for signal and \(\vec{t}\)\(H(\rightarrow\gamma\gamma)\) are shown in Figure 6 for events containing at least two isolated photons.

In applying this selection an optimistic assumption is being made on the effect of pile-up jets with respect to what is described in Ref. [7], based on which about three pile-up jets with \(\mathrm{p}_{T}>25\) GeV are expected per event. The upper cut on \(\mathrm{N}_{j}\) is therefore appropriate under the assumption of a well-performing track confirmation algorithm, or similar tool for suppressing pile-up jets, such as Jet Vertex Tagging [23]. Note that, although it is also observed that the jet multiplicity is lower in the signal samples using Pythia 6 with respect to samples using Pythia 8, the latter are conservatively used in this study to present the expected sensitivity.

Applying a veto on isolated (as per the description in section 3.2) leptons above 25 GeV is also useful for reducing the background contribution from processes involving \(t\bar{t}\) decays to at least one lepton.

The final selection is summarised in Table 3.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|l|} \hline Event Selection Criteria \\ \hline \hline \(\geq\) 2 isolated photons, with \(\mathrm{p}_{T}>30\) GeV, \(|\eta|<1.37\) or \(1.52<|\eta|<2.37\) \\ \hline \(\geq\) 2 jets identified as \(b\)-jets with leading/subleading \(\mathrm{p}_{T}>40/25\) GeV, \(|\eta|<2.5\) \\ \hline No isolated leptons with \(\mathrm{p}_{T}>25\) GeV, \(|\eta|<2.5\) \\ \hline \(<\) 6 jets with \(\mathrm{p}_{T}>25\) GeV, \(|\eta|<2.5\) \\ \hline \(0.4<\Delta R^{b\bar{b}}<2.0\), \(0.4<\Delta R^{\gamma\gamma}<2.0\), \(\Delta R^{\gamma b}>0.4\) \\ \hline \(100<m_{h\bar{b}}<150\) GeV, \(123<m_{\gamma\gamma}<128\) GeV \\ \hline \(\mathrm{p}_{T}^{\gamma\gamma}\), \(\mathrm{p}_{T}^{b\bar{b}}>110\) GeV \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}

### Results

Following the analysis procedure outlined, an expected signal yield of 8.4 events in 3000 fb\({}^{-1}\) is obtained. The expected total background yield is \(\sim 47\) events, with the largest contributions coming from \(b\overline{b}\gamma\gamma\) and \(b\overline{b}\gamma j\) events. Some other processes, such as \(jjjj\), \(jjj\gamma\), \(bc\gamma\gamma\), \(bjj\gamma\), \(t\bar{t}(\to b\overline{b})\), \(H(\to b\overline{b})\gamma\gamma\), \(H(\to b\overline{b})\gamma j\), \(H(\to b\overline{b})jj\), fully hadronic \(t\bar{t}\) decays, \(Z(\to b\overline{b})\gamma\gamma\), were also considered. The corresponding yields were determined to be smaller than one event and neglected. The contribution from \(c\overline{c}j\gamma\) was estimated to be of order three events and will be included in future studies. The invariant mass distribution of m\({}_{b\bar{b}}\) (m\({}_{\gamma\gamma}\)) is shown in Figure 7a (Figure 7b) after applying the \(123<m_{\gamma\gamma}<128\) (\(100<m_{b\overline{b}}<150\)) GeV mass cut.

Splitting the events into two categories, one with both photons in the barrel (\(|\eta|<1.37\)) and another one with at least one photon in the endcap part of the calorimeter (\(1.52<|\eta|<2.37\)) takes advantage of different S/B ratios and improves the expected significance. The expected numbers of signal and background events are summarised in Table 4.

It is expected that the backgrounds will be able to be well understood through studying sidebands and control regions, as demonstrated in [24]. The uncertainties that are listed in Table 4 consequently do not contain any systematic uncertainty and are purely the result of the available Monte Carlo statistics, therefore not properly representing the accuracy with which the background will be estimated.

The foreseen signal acceptance is about 2.6%, 2.0%, 3.1% and 0.7% for respectively \(\lambda/\lambda_{SM}=0\), 1, 2 and 10, reflecting the selection optimization for scenarios with \(\lambda_{HHH}\) expected to be close to the Standard Model value. The significance \(S/\sqrt{B}\) for the SM scenario is expected to be around 1.3 in the full 3000 fb\({}^{-1}\) HL-LHC dataset for this channel. Despite the lower acceptance, due to the increased cross section, the sensitivity to the \(\lambda/\lambda_{SM}=10\) is nevertheless larger than the SM one.

### Limits setting

In this section, the CLs technique [25] is used to set an upper limit on the total (box + self-coupling) number of HH signal events in the pseudo-dataset corresponding to 3000 fb\({}^{-1}\), neglecting the effect of systematic uncertainties.

The alternative hypothesis is the Standard Model, i.e. the sum of the background and of the signal contribution for \(\lambda/\lambda_{SM}=1\) ; the null hypothesis is the sum of the Standard Model (i.e. the sum of the background and of the signal contribution for \(\lambda/\lambda_{SM}=1\)) and of some additional contribution of \(N\) events. \(N\) is the parameter of interest of the model.

This limit (dashed line) on the total number of HH events in the datasets (from the \(N\) additional events summed with the \(\lambda/\lambda_{SM}=1\) signal contribution) as well as the \(\pm 1/2\sigma\) uncertainty bands are shown in Figure 8. It is overlaid on the parametrization of the number of predicted total (box + self-coupling) HH events as a function of the \(\lambda/\lambda_{SM}\) ratio after application of the analysis cuts described in the previous sections (red line). The minimum of this curve is slightly displaced with respect to the dependence of the cross-section including the initial mixture of box, self-coupling and interference effects seen on Figure 2 due to the effects of the analysis selection.

The projections of the analysis described in the note foresee an exclusion at 95% C.L. of BSM models with \(\lambda/\lambda_{SM}\lesssim-1.3\) and \(\lambda/\lambda_{SM}\gtrsim 8.7\).

Table 4: Expected yields in 3000 fb\({}^{-1}\) for all events, events with both photons in the barrel calorimeter region (“barrel”) and events with at least one photon in the endcap calorimeter region (“end-cap”). The quoted errors are from MC statistics only. The final two rows show the total background and the resulting signal significance, S/\(\sqrt{B}\), in 3000 fb\({}^{-1}\) ; combining the “barrel” and “endcap” categories in quadrature the final significance reaches \(\sim 1.3\sigma\).

Figure 7: The distributions of \(m_{b\overline{b}}\) (a) and \(m_{\gamma\gamma}\) (b) for 3000 fb\({}^{-1}\) after applying all the selection criteria except the \(m_{b\overline{b}}\) (a) and \(m_{\gamma\gamma}\) (b) mass cuts. The individual shapes of the contributions are obtained using the events surviving the event selection before the mass criteria and angular cuts are applied, but normalized to the number of expected events after the full event selection. The \(t\bar{t}X\) contribution includes \(t\bar{t}(\geq 1\) lepton) and \(t\bar{t}\gamma\), while ‘Others’ includes \(c\bar{c}\gamma\gamma\), \(b\bar{b}\gamma j\), \(b\bar{b}jj\) and \(jj\gamma\gamma\).

Conclusions

A cut-based analysis has been performed for the channel \(H(\to\gamma\gamma)H(\to b\overline{b})\), using generator-level events with parameterised efficiency and resolution functions applied to mimic the expected performance of an upgraded ATLAS detector at the HL-LHC. The analysis yielded a signal significance around \(1.3\sigma\). While this would not be enough on its own to claim evidence for the observation of Higgs pair production, or determine whether the Higgs self-coupling strength is close to its SM expectation, it could form a useful contribution to a combined measurement across several channels (in combination with channels such as \(H(\to\tau\tau)H(\to b\overline{b})\) and \(H(\to b\overline{b})H(\to b\overline{b})\), for example), and potentially also in combination with results from the CMS experiment. Given this fact, ATLAS and CMS have been in discussion over their respective analyses in this channel, and will continue to do so in order to better understand any remaining differences between the analyses and potential avenues for improving the sensitivity.

A number of event observables have not been used in the event selection for this analysis, due to their moderate to low discriminating power, for example the sub-leading photon \(\mathrm{p}_{T}\). Such obervables, however, could be included in a Multi Variate Analysis, and used to further enhance the \(S/B\) ratio and signal significance \(S/\sqrt{B}\). Preliminary studies using an MVA approach offered a 30% increase in signal significance for a fixed signal yield. Finally, including other production modes in the study could also lead to a small increase in signal yield.
