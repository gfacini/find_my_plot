**ATLAS Sensitivity Prospects for Higgs Boson Production at the LHC Running at 7 TeV**

 ATLAS Collaboration

###### Abstract

Projections for the ATLAS sensitivity, in selected channels, to the Standard Model and Minimal Super-Symmetric Standard Model Higgs boson(s) from LHC running at 7 TeV are reported. The results are based on re-scaling expectations from detailed analyses at 10 or 14 TeV using cross-section ratios or parton distribution function re-weighting to arrive at the 7 TeV projections.

Introduction

The Higgs mechanism is a proposed solution to the electroweak symmetry breaking mystery which predicts the existence of an undiscovered scalar particle in the Standard Model (SM) or five such in the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM). Its discovery is the primary physics goal of the Tevatron and LHC physics programs and the discovery potential has been studied extensively for the LHC running at its design energy of \(\sqrt{s}=14\) TeV [1]. Combining the results from CDF and DO, the Tevatron has recently excluded a SM Higgs boson in the mass range of \(162<M_{H}<166\) GeV at 95% CL [2]. Recently, search sensitivities have been investigated for \(\sqrt{s}=10\) TeV in public [3] and private documents. These new studies take into account all major backgrounds, use full simulations for both signal and background events, incorporate realistic systematic uncertainties and employ advanced statistical treatments.

At the time of writing, the LHC plan is to run at \(\sqrt{s}=7\) TeV and accumulate about 1 fb\({}^{-1}\) of integrated luminosity by the end of 2011. This note assesses the reach of the ATLAS Higgs boson searches for this energy/luminosity scenario. These results are obtained by scaling the full, detailed 10 TeV (or 14 TeV) analyses [3, 4] to 7 TeV using cross-section ratios at the two centre-of-mass energies, having checked that the event selection efficiencies are stable between the two energies. These results are used to to extract the approximate ATLAS sensitivity to the Higgs boson, expressed in terms of expected 95% confidence level upper limits, in selected representative channels. These are the Standard Model channels \(H\to WW\), \(H\to ZZ\to 4l\) and \(H\to\gamma\gamma\) and the MSSM channels \(H/A\to\mu\mu\) and \(H^{+}\to\tau\nu/c\bar{s}\).

This note is organised as follows. The cross-sections of the processes involved are discussed in Section 2 and systematic uncertainties are discussed in Section 3. The effects of additional minimum bias interactions per bunch crossing are addressed in Section 4. The \(H\to WW\) results at 7 TeV are presented in Section 5. A parton distribution function re-weighting technique is also used for this channel: this is presented in Appendix A as a cross check on the \(H\to WW\) cross-section scaling results. In Section 6, we describe the \(H\to ZZ\to 4l\) results. In Section 7, we present similar results for the \(H\to\gamma\gamma\) channel and the statistical combination of the \(H\to WW\), \(H\to ZZ\) and \(H\to\gamma\gamma\) is described in Section 8. We also study some MSSM channels, namely the charged Higgs search in the \(\tau\nu\) and \(c\bar{s}\) channels (this is presented in Section 9), and the \(H/A\) decay to \(\mu\mu\) is described in Section 10. Finally, in Section 11, we add some concluding remarks.

## 2 Cross-sections

All background processes were simulated at 10 TeV and passed through the full detector simulation package [3, 4]. Signal data samples were in general fully simulated, but in the \(H\to\mu\mu\) channels they have been obtained with the ATLAS fast simulation ATLFAST-II package using a parametrised description of the calorimeter response, combined with the full simulation of inner detector and muon spectrometer tracks. An excellent agreement between the ATLFAST-II and the full simulation has been demonstrated.

### Background processes

In this note, for all channels studied, common values are used for the cross-sections of various background processes generated with MC@NLO [5], ALPGEN [6] or PYTHIA [7]. The resulting cross-section numbers are given in Table 1.

In addition to these there are samples of di-jet, \(\gamma\)-jet, Drell Yan and dedicated filtered di-leptons originating from \(b\bar{b}\), all of which were generated with PYTHIA. Further details may be found in the analyses done at 10 TeV [3, 4].

### Higgs Boson Productions

At the LHC, the Higgs boson may be produced via several different processes, such as those shown in Fig. 1. These have all been calculated at NLO precision or better and the cross-sections are shown in Fig. 2. Gluon fusion, 1(a), produced through a heavy quark loop, is known at next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) in QCD and including electroweak (EW) corrections [8, 9, 10] with soft gluon re-summation up to next-next-to-leading log (NNLL) [11]. Vector Boson Fusion (VBF), 1(b), is known at NLO QCD and with EW corrections. The associated production with a \(W\) or a \(Z\), 1(c), is known at NNLO QCD including EW corrections and the associated production with a pair of top quarks, 1(d), is known at NLO. In order to be consistent with the perturbative order at which the cross-section of background is calculated, the cross-sections of these processes are taken at NLO for all the SM processes considered in this paper.

The cross-sections of both signal and background processes depend strongly on \(\sqrt{s}\). Cross-section ratios, defined as the cross-sections normalised to their values at \(\sqrt{s}=10\) TeV, are given in Table 2 and illustrated in Fig. 3 for \(\sqrt{s}\) values between 2 and 14 TeV for a few selected processes. From 10 TeV to 7 TeV, cross-section reductions are approximately 50% for the signal (\(M_{H}=160\) GeV), 32% for \(W\), 40% for \(WW\) and 60% for \(t\bar{t}\) production.

Five Higgs bosons are predicted in the MSSM: two neutral CP-even known as \(h\) and \(H\), one CP-odd \(A\) and two charged \(H^{\pm}\). At tree level, the Higgs sector in MSSM is described by two parameters, usually chosen to be the mass of the CP-odd Higgs \(m_{A}\) and the ratio of vacuum expectation values \(\tan\beta\). The neutral Higgs bosons are produced mainly through two processes at the LHC: in association with bottom quarks and through gluon fusion, as shown in Fig. 4.

The cross-section for the gluon fusion process is calculated in the same way as for the standard model \(gg\to H\) processes. The cross-section of the \(b\)-associated process can be calculated either in a

\begin{tabular}{c c c} \hline \hline Process & Generator & Cross-section \\ \hline \(t\bar{t}\) & MC@NLO & 160 pb \\ single top & MC@NLO & \(\sigma_{s}=3.9\) pb, \(\sigma_{t}=58.7\) pb and \(\sigma_{Wt}=13.1\) pb \\ \(W\to l\nu\) + 0-5 partons & ALPGEN/PYTHIA & 31.8 nb \\ \(Z\to ll\) + 0-5 partons & ALPGEN/PYTHIA & 3.1 nb \\ \(W(\to l\nu)+b\bar{b}\) + 0-3 partons: & ALPGEN & 9.5 pb \\ \(Z(\to ll)+b\bar{b}\) + 0-2 partons: & ALPGEN & 28.9 pb \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}

4-flavor scheme as \(gg\to b\bar{b}H\) or in a 5-flavor scheme as \(b\bar{b}\to H\), where the difference in the number of flavors refers to whether or not \(b\)-quarks are included as an active flavor in the parton density functions of protons. Higher order QCD corrections have been calculated up to NLO for the 4-flavor scheme [13, 14] and NNLO for the 5-flavor scheme [15]. The charged Higgs bosons can be directly produced in association with top quarks, but this note only considers production indirectly from top quark decays (\(t\to H^{+}b\)), i.e., \(M_{H^{\pm}}<m_{t}\). Partial NNLO corrections are available for the \(t\bar{t}\) process [16], the dominant top quark source for \(t\to H^{+}b\) decays. The branching ratio of \(t\to H^{+}b\) is evaluated with FeynHiggs [17, 18, 19, 20]. Heavy charged Higgs cross-sections are estimated at NLO [21]. Apart from QCD corrections at NLO or higher, all calculations also contain the leading supersymmetric corrections, the so-called \(\Delta m_{b}\) corrections [21], leading to a reduction factor

\[f=(1+\Delta m_{b})^{-2}. \tag{1}\]

The heavy \(H^{+}\) cross-sections with QCD corrections at NLO have to be multiplied with this factor to include the leading supersymmetric corrections. The value of \(\Delta m_{b}\) can be calculated with FeynHiggs for MSSM scenarios defined at the weak scale.

Along with the improvement of theoretical calculations, recent advances in constraining parton density functions (PDF) have also contributed significantly to our improved knowledge of the Higgs boson production cross-sections. Most of these calculations use MSTW2008 (LO, NLO, NNLO) and CTEQ6.6 (NLO) [22] PDF sets.

The production cross-sections and decay branching ratios of the Higgs bosons depend on a large number of standard model parameters. Unless otherwise specified, the following _default_ parameter sets are used: \(m_{uds}=190\) MeV, \(m_{c}=1.40\) GeV, \(m_{b}=4.75\) GeV, \(m_{t}=172.5\) GeV, \(M_{W}=80.398\) GeV, \(M_{Z}=91.1876\) GeV and \(G_{F}=1.16639\times 10^{-5}\) GeV\({}^{-2}\). Pole quark mass values are quoted here. The strong coupling constant \(\alpha_{s}\) is in general taken to be the value from the PDF set used. MSTW2008 determines the \(\alpha_{s}\) value as part of its PDF fit: \(\alpha_{s}(M_{Z})=0.13939\) at LO, 0.12018 at NLO and 0.11707 at NNLO. On the other hand, the CTEQ collaboration uses the world average values (\(\alpha_{s}(M_{Z})=0.130\) at LO and \(\alpha_{s}(M_{Z})=0.118\) at NLO) for its PDF fits.

The cross-section changes with the renormalisation scale \(\mu_{R}\) and factorisation scales \(\mu_{F}\) as a result of uncalculated higher order effects. Starting from a median scale \(\mu_{0}\), which is considered the "natural scale" of the process and is expected to absorb the large logarithmic corrections, the current standard convention is to vary the two scales, either collectively or independently, within \(\mu_{0}/\xi\leq\mu_{R},\mu_{F}\leq\xi\mu_{0}\). Depending on the process, \(\xi=2\) or larger. The variation of the scales results in a uncertainty band: the narrower the band is, the smaller the higher-order corrections are expected to be. This is by no means a rigorous way to estimate the theoretical uncertainty.

### Higgs Boson Decays

The SM Higgs boson decay branching ratios have been estimated taking into account several contributions, namely those included in HDECAY [23] and PROPHECY4f [24] with the addition of the full two-loop EW corrections evaluated in [25].

The HDECAY program calculates the decay widths and branching ratio of the Higgs boson(s) in the SM and in the MSSM. For the SM specifically, it includes all the channels kinematically allowed (also the loop mediated ones), all the relevant higher order QCD corrections to the decays into quark pairs and into gluons (quark loop mediated decays) and the double off-shell decays of the Higgs boson into massive gauge bosons which then decay into four massless fermions.

PROPHECY4f is a Monte Carlo event generator for the specific simulations of the Higgs boson decay \(H\to ZZ/WW\to 4\) fermions (leptonic, semi-leptonic and four-quark) final states. The calculation of the complete electroweak \(O(\alpha)\) and QCD \(O(\alpha_{s})\) corrections to the processes \(H\to 4f\), includes both the corrections to \(WW\) and \(ZZ\) decays and their interference. The QCD corrections additionally include leading 2-loop corrections from the Higgs boson self-interaction as discussed in [26]. The intermediate gauge bosons are treated as resonances (and their widths calculated at NLO), without any on-shell approximation and the calculation covers the full Higgs boson mass range near, and below the gauge-boson pair thresholds. The bottom quark is treated like any other massless quark. PROPHECY4f provides \(\Gamma(\text{LO})\) and \(\Gamma(\text{NLO})\) partial width to any of the possible \(4f\) final states. The \(H\to WW/ZZ\) on-shell

processes give the width for the decay into a pair of on-shell massive gauge bosons at leading and next-to-leading order. The Higgs-boson-mass-enhanced two-loop terms have also been included in the NLO result. The decays of the \(W/Z\) bosons are not included here. Using the LO/NLO \(W/Z\) widths in the LO/NLO calculation ensures that the _effective_ branching ratios of the \(W/Z\) obtained by summing over all decay channels add up to one.

References [25, 27, 28, 29, 30] evaluate the corrections to the \(H\to\gamma\gamma\) decay. The EW corrections are numerically small and have opposite sign with respect to the NLO QCD correction, resulting in a partial cancellation of the two effects. Recently, the results in [25, 27, 28, 29, 30] have been updated to include the accurate description of the effects in proximity of the threshold for \(WW\) and \(ZZ\) production, removing the spikes present in [25] and extending the validity of [29] till \(M_{H}<m_{t}+M_{W}\).

Under the assumption that EW corrections factorise with respect to the QCD dynamics, they result in a factor \(1+\delta^{\rm EW}_{\gamma\gamma}\) multiplying the QCD results (for fixed \(M_{H}\)). The exact validity of this approximation has been discussed in [31]. The authors evaluate numerically the sub-leading \(\mathrm{EW}\times\mathrm{QCD}\) (3-loop) mixed terms which appear in the exact calculation under the assumption that the large logarithms due to the soft and collinear initial state radiation factorise, and found them to be small and not factorising. Therefore, excluding unexpected discoveries (e.g. if the large soft and collinear logarithms were not to factorise with respect to the NLO EW corrections), the assumption of factorisation between EW and QCD dynamics represents a good approximation of the higher order corrections to Higgs boson cross-section and decay. In this approximation, the partial width of \(H\to\gamma\gamma\), can be written as

\[\Gamma_{\gamma\gamma}(M_{H})=[1+\delta^{\rm EW}_{\gamma\gamma}(M_{H})]\cdot[1 +\delta^{\rm QCD}_{\gamma\gamma}(M_{H})]\cdot\Gamma^{0}_{\gamma\gamma} \tag{2}\]

Here \(\Gamma^{0}_{\gamma\gamma}\) is the partial decay width at the leading order, \(\delta^{\rm EW}_{\gamma\gamma}\) and \(\delta^{\rm QCD}_{\gamma\gamma}\) are higher order EW and QCD corrections. \(\delta^{\rm EW}_{\gamma\gamma}\) values have been calculated in [25]. The HDECAY program calculates \([1+\delta^{\rm QCD}_{\gamma\gamma}]\Gamma^{0}_{\gamma\gamma}\) as a whole. As mentioned, \(\delta^{\rm EW}_{\gamma\gamma}\) and \(\delta^{\rm QCD}_{\gamma\gamma}\) tend to cancel to a large extent. The correction factor \(\delta^{\rm EW}_{\gamma\gamma}\) contains:

* The exact dependence on the light quark corrections as in [25] improved by the use of complex masses for \(W\) and \(Z\) ;
* The effect of heavy quark corrections as described in [30] for \(M_{H}<150\) GeV.

The state of the art prediction for the Higgs boson width includes the results from HDECAY, plus the EW NLO corrections described above, plus the full \(H\to 4\) fermions from PROPHECY4f. Operatively, the Higgs boson total decay width given by HDECAY has been modified according to the following prescription:

\[\Gamma_{H}=\Gamma^{\rm HD}-\Gamma^{\rm HD}_{ZZ}-\Gamma^{\rm HD}_{WW}+\Gamma^ {\rm PR}_{4f}+\Gamma^{\rm HD}_{\gamma\gamma}\cdot\left(\delta^{\rm EW}_{\gamma \gamma}+\delta^{\rm QED}_{\gamma e^{+}e^{-}}\right), \tag{3}\]

where \(\Gamma_{H}\) is the total Higgs boson width, \(\Gamma^{\rm HD}\) is the Higgs boson width reported by HDECAY, and \(\Gamma^{\rm HD}_{ZZ}\) and \(\Gamma^{\rm HD}_{WW}\) stand for the partial Higgs boson width to \(ZZ\) and \(WW\) calculated with HDECAY, respectively, while \(\Gamma^{PR}_{4f}\) represents the partial width of \(H\to 4f\) calculated with PROPHECY4f. The additional \(\Gamma^{\rm HD}_{\gamma\gamma}\) and \(\delta^{\rm EW}_{\gamma\gamma}\) terms represent the partial width of \(H\to\gamma\gamma\) calculated with HDECAY and the EW corrections to this decay. Finally, \(\delta^{\rm QED}_{\gamma e^{+}e^{-}}\) corresponds to the fractional contribution of the partial width of \(H\to\gamma e^{+}e^{-}\) with respect to \(\Gamma^{\rm HD}_{\gamma\gamma}\)[32].

The branching ratios of the MSSM Higgs bosons are evaluated using FeynHiggs [19, 20].

## 3 Statistical and Systematic Uncertainties

The analyses in this note present expected 95% CL upper limits on various Higgs cross-sections. These are based on the observed number of signal candidate events and the expected number of background
