A detailed study of the associated Standard Model Higgs boson production \(\PW\)/\(\ZH\) in 14 TeV pp (LHC) and 2 TeV \(\bbbar\) (Tevatron) collisions, with \(\PH\to\bbbar\) decay and \(\PW\Z\to\E_{T}^{miss}+\X\), is presented for a Higgs mass \(\rm m_{H}~{}=~{}100\GeV\).

The observation of these events with ATLAS at LHC is considered not to be feasible because of the overwhelming background from QCD events [1]. On the other hand, this signature is claimed to be promising for Higgs discovery at the Tevatron over the mass range 90-140 GeV [2].

The aim of this paper is to provide a quantitative comparison in a consistent framework of the physics potential for this signature in both colliding scenarios. The emphasis is put on the differences in the expected signal and backgrounds rates and the background composition.

Introduction

Since the direct production, \(\mathrm{gg\to H}\) with \(\mathrm{H\to b\bar{b}}\), cannot be efficiently triggered nor extracted above the huge QCD two-jet background, the associated production with a W- or Z-boson or a \(\mathrm{t\bar{t}}\) pair is the only possible process to observe a signal from the \(\mathrm{H\to b\bar{b}}\) decays. The final state of the decaying Z or W (produced directly or from \(\mathrm{t\bar{t}}\)) might provide a handle to extract a signal above the overwhelming QCD background, thanks to the isolated lepton in the final state.

Prospects for the \(\mathrm{H\to b\bar{b}}\) observability in the associated production with a W or a \(\mathrm{t\bar{t}}\) pair have been discussed already in several documents of the ATLAS Collaboration [1, 4]. The production in association with a top pair, \(\mathrm{t\bar{t}H}\) has been established as a valuable discovery channel [5], while the sensitivity to the WH production, studied already in [6], has been confirmed recently [3] to be rather weak.

ZH production has not been studied in details since it is not considered to be a discovery channel [1]. With the \(\mathrm{Z\to\ell\ell}\) decay, leading to a \(\ell\ell bb\) final state, it provides initial rate which is about six times lower than the WH rate. The signal-to-background ratio is not expected to be significantly better compared to the WH channel [3]. With the \(\mathrm{Z\to\nu\,\nu}\) decay, leading to a \(E_{T}^{miss}+b\bar{b}\) final state, it is be difficult to extract from the potentially very large backgrounds given the rather low missing transverse energy expected for the signal events.

Therefore it is important to understand why this last channel is considered as a discovery channel at the upgraded Tevatron [2]. Although some advantages might come from the reduced centre-of-mass energy (more central event topology at lower energy, less hadronic activity in the event, relative magnitude of the \(\mathrm{t\bar{t}}\) cross-section), it is obvious that for the same assumed integrated luminosity the expected rates are substantially lower at the Tevatron than at the LHC.

In this paper, WH/ZH associated production leading to \(\mathrm{E_{T}^{miss}+bb}\) final states is studied. First a detailed evaluation of the signal and background is presented for the LHC case and then the comparison of the 2 TeV \(\mathrm{p\bar{p}}\) and 14 TeV \(\mathrm{p\bar{p}}\) scenarios is discussed. Particular emphasis is put on the determination of the QCD background.

## 2 Expected production rates

The studied signature consists of two identified b-jets accompanied by missing transverse energy. The irreducible background comes from processes with true isolated missing energy from W or Z decays. However, the key point for the observation of this channel is the capability to suppress the several orders of magnitude larger QCD background with fake or true missing transverse energy.

Table 1 shows the production cross-sections for the signal and various background-s as obtained with PYTHIA 5.7 and CTEQ2L structure functions. The \(\mathrm{H,Z\to b\bar{b}}\), \(\mathrm{W\to l\nu(l=e,\mu)}\) and \(\mathrm{Z\to\nu\nu}\) branching ratios are included. The \(\mathrm{W+jet}\), \(\mathrm{Z+jet}\) and QCD cross-sections are quoted for the hard process transverse momenta, \(p_{T}^{hard}\), in specified ranges. To this signature also events from \(\mathrm{Z\to\tau\tau}\) and \(\mathrm{W\to\tau\nu}\) contribute significantly. These are included in the final estimates of the expected rates.

The dominant uncertainties on the expected rates arise from higher order corrections and, to a smaller extent, from the structure function parameterisation. A larger uncertainty is expected for W+jet and Z+jet production since the jets in the final state are generated with the parton shower approach (see also discussion in [3]).

For all cases the Monte Carlo statistics used in this study is very high. Typically \(10^{5}\) events were simulated for each background process. In addition, in the case of the W+jet and Z+jet processes \(5\cdot 10^{6}\) events were simulated in each \(\mathrm{p_{T}^{hard}}\) range and for the QCD background around \(10^{8}\) events were simulated in total, sampled with grids in \(\mathrm{p_{T}^{hard}}\) of 5 GeV and 10 GeV.

As shown in Table 1, signal and resonant background cross-sections are almost a factor of ten higher for 14 TeV pp collisions. Inclusive rates for Z + jet, W + jet and QCD production are higher by at least a factor of ten, the difference increasing with rising threshold on the transverse momentum of the hard scattering process.

## 3 Simulation procedure and selection criteria

In a first step, the signal and the backgrounds containing \(\mathrm{t\overline{t}}\) pair or W and Z bosons are analysed with a selection adequate to extract a signal above the irreducible and reducible backgrounds with true isolated missing energy from heavy bosons decay to neutrinos. Such a selection is not sufficient to suppress the QCD background. Complementary selection criteria, which might further reject the huge reducible background while remaining efficient for the signal events are discussed in Section 4.6.

The first step selection criteria for the \(\mathrm{E_{T}^{miss}+b\overline{b}}\) final state are:

* \(\mbox{$E_{T}^{miss}$}\): The missing transverse energy, calculated from the total sum of the deposited energies in the calorimeters is required to be larger than 30 GeV.
* _"LVLI" selection_: \(\mathrm{E_{T}^{miss}}\ >\ 50\) GeV and at least one jet with \(\mathrm{p_{T}}\ >\ 50\) GeV and \(|\eta|\ <\ 3.2\) to simulate the ATLAS LVL1 trigger selection [10]. In the results presented below, trigger efficiency is not included and the thresholds are set on the jet transverse momenta and missing transverse energy as reconstructed from the fast simulation.
* _2 b-jets_: 2 b-labelled jets with \(\mathrm{p_{T}}\ >\ 15\) GeV and pseudorapidity \(|\eta|\ <\ 2.5\). The procedure for jets recalibration and b-labelling is described in [7].
* _Jet-veto_: No additional jet with \(\mathrm{p_{T}}\ >\ 30\) GeV and \(|\eta|\ <\ 5.0\).
* _Lepton-veto_: No isolated lepton with \(\mathrm{p_{T}}>\ 6\) GeV and \(|\eta|\ <\ 2.5\).
* _Mass window:_ Is chosen to be \(\mathrm{m_{b\,b}}\ =\ 100\ \pm\ 20\) GeV. The acceptance in this mass window is 85% for the signal events and 73% for the resonant ZZ/WZ backgrounds. An acceptance of 82% was obtained for the signal events with a full simulation and without applying the jet veto cut [1]. As discussed in [3], the jet veto leads to a better acceptance inside the mass window, because events with large radiation are rejected by this cut.
* _b-tagging_: A b-tagging efficiency of 60% with a rejection of 10 and 100 against c-jets and light-jets respectively is used. Studies of the impact of the \(\mathrm{p_{T}}\) and \(|\eta|\) dependence of the b-tagging efficiency on the signal observability can be found in [1, 8].

### ZH and WH signals

Cumulative acceptances for signal events from the ZH and WH production processes are given in Table 2 and the expected number of events for an integrated luminosity of 30 \(fb^{-1}\) are shown in Table 3.

Backgrounds containing \(\mathrm{W}\rightarrow\ell\nu\) are rejected by the lepton veto and backgrounds containing \(\mathrm{W}\rightarrow\tau\nu\) and \(\mathrm{Z}\rightarrow\tau\tau\) by the jet veto. The signal acceptance is more than three times higher for the associated production with \(\mathrm{W}\rightarrow\tau\nu\) than with \(\mathrm{W}\rightarrow\ell\nu\). The associated production with \(\mathrm{Z}\rightarrow\tau\tau\) has a very low acceptance.

Depending on the details of the selection criteria, see Table 3, the ZH with \(\mathrm{Z}\rightarrow\nu\nu\) channel contributes between 50% (no jet veto) and 70% (with jet veto) to the total signal rate. Significant contribution, 32% or 18% for the cases without and with jet veto, comes also from the WH with \(\mathrm{W}\rightarrow\tau\nu\) channel.

\begin{table}

\end{table}
Table 2: _For signal events, expected cumulative acceptances of the selection criteria. The b-tagging efficiency and the acceptance in the mass window are not included._

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:7]

The total number of expected events inside the mass window is almost two times higher than for the signal. The presence of a signal will broaden and increase the resonant mass peak expected from the ZZ and WZ events, as already discussed in [3] for the \(\ell\)b\(\bar{\mathrm{b}}\) and \(\ell\ell\)b\(\bar{\mathrm{b}}\) signatures. The capability of extracting a Higgs signal peak would rely on the capability of calibrating the resonant and continuum backgrounds using data and Monte Carlo simulations.

### Zjj and Wjj backgrounds

\(\bullet\)**Zjj background**

The Zjj background has been simulated using \(gq\to Z+q\), \(q\bar{q}\to Z+g\) matrix element calculations and parton shower, as implemented in PYTHIA. Acceptances of selection criteria are specified in Table 6. As already discussed in [3], the dominant \(gg\to Zb\bar{b}\) contribution is obtained through the evolution of the structure functions and not by matrix element calculations. Therefore the results presented below very likely underestimate the contribution from this subprocess. A more detailed discussion on the heavy flavour composition of this background is given in [3]. The fraction of Zb\(\bar{\mathrm{b}}\) events in the total Zjj background depends on the selection criteria, reaching 90% for the "LVL1" selection with jet veto.

Only the Zjj with \(\mathrm{Z\to\nu\nu}\) background was simulated. The additional contribution from Zjj events with \(\mathrm{Z\to\tau\tau}\) was estimated assuming that the ratio of the acceptances for

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|} \hline \hline Cumulative & Without ”LVL1” & With ”LVL1” \\ acceptance & & \\ \hline \hline \(\mathrm{E_{T}^{miss}}\) + lepton veto & 82.2\% & 59.4\% \\ \hline + 2 b-labelled jets & filter & filter \\ \hline + jet veto 30 GeV & 23.9\% & 15.7\% \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 5: _The same as Table 3 but for ZZ and WZ events._these two channels is similar to that for the ZZ background. The contribution to the total Zjj background would be 5% (resp. 1%) for the selection without jet veto (resp. with jet veto). However since large uncertainties affect the estimation of the total Zjj background, the \(\mathrm{Z\to\tau\tau}\) contribution has been neglected.

\(\bullet\)**Wjj continuum background**

Similarly to the Zjj case, also this background was simulated using PYTHIA. More detailed discussions on the jet flavour composition and comparisons with the matrix element (ME) calculations for the \(\mathrm{q\overline{q}}\to\mathrm{Wbb}\) subprocess can be found in [3].

Only Wjj with \(\mathrm{W\to\ell\nu}\) was simulated. Acceptances of selection criteria are given in Table 7. The additional contribution from Wjj events with \(\mathrm{W\to\tau\nu}\) was estimated by assuming that the ratio of acceptances for these two channels is similar to the respective ratio for the WZ background with \(\mathrm{W\to\tau\nu}\) and \(\mathrm{W\to\ell\nu}\) decays.

\(\bullet\)**Total background from Zjj and Wjj events**

The total continuum background is dominated by true \(\mathrm{Wb\overline{b}}\) and \(\mathrm{Zb\overline{b}}\) events. Table 8 gives expected number of events for an integrated luminosity of 30 \(fb^{-1}\).

\begin{table}

\end{table}
Table 8: _The same as Table 3 but for Zjj and Wjj events._

### Top pair and single top background

\(\bullet\)**Top pair background**

This channel results in a \(\mathrm{W}\mathrm{W}\mathrm{b}\overline{\mathrm{b}}\) final state. The decays \(\mathrm{W}\rightarrow\tau\nu\) or \(\mathrm{W}\rightarrow\ell\nu\) lead to true missing transverse energy. The combination of a lepton veto and jet veto leads to a huge rejection of this background. The total acceptance, as shown in Table 9, is 0.16% for \(\mathrm{W}\rightarrow\tau\nu\) and 0.09% for \(\mathrm{W}\rightarrow\ell\nu\) decays of at least one \(\mathrm{W}\) from the top pair. The rejection of events with a \(\mathrm{W}\rightarrow\ell\nu\) is factor of 20 higher than for \(\ell b\overline{b}\) final states (see Section 2.3 of [3]). After the jet veto, the expected background from \(\mathrm{t}\overline{\mathrm{t}}\) events is at most a factor of two higher than the expected signal. This background is therefore small for the \(E_{T}^{miss}+b\overline{b}\) signature.

\(\bullet\)**tb, tc backgrounds**

These channels result in \(\mathrm{W}\mathrm{b}\) final states with an additional quark from the hard process. The decays \(\mathrm{W}\rightarrow\tau\nu\) or \(\mathrm{W}\rightarrow\ell\nu\) lead to true missing transverse energy. The combination of a lepton veto and jet veto leads to a lepton veto and jet veto provides a huge rejection of these backgrounds. The cumulative acceptance, as shown in Table 10, is 0.4% for \(\mathrm{W}\rightarrow\tau\nu\) and 0.15% for \(\mathrm{W}\rightarrow\ell\nu\) decays for events pre-selected by requiring at least 2 b- or c- labelled jets. The rejection of events with a \(\mathrm{W}\rightarrow\ell\nu\) decay is a factor of 17 higher than for \(\ell b\overline{b}\) final states (see Section 2.3. of [3]). The expected number of tb, tc events is almost eight times smaller than the expected number of signal events after applying a jet veto. This background is more than a factor 15 smaller than the \(\mathrm{t}\overline{\mathrm{t}}\) background and contributes marginally to the backgrounds to the \(\mathrm{E}_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}+\mathrm{b}\overline{\mathrm{b}}\) signature.

\(\bullet\)\(\mathrm{W}^{*}\rightarrow\mathrm{tb}\)**background**

This channel results in a \(\mathrm{W}\mathrm{b}\overline{\mathrm{b}}\) final state. The decays \(\mathrm{W}\rightarrow\tau\nu\) or \(\mathrm{W}\rightarrow\ell\nu\) lead to true missing transverse energy. The combination of a lepton veto and jet veto provides a huge rejection of this channel. This background was generated with HERWIG Monte Carlo and only the \(\mathrm{W}\rightarrow\ell\nu\) decay mode could be simulated with the available version. To estimate the \(\mathrm{W}\rightarrow\tau\nu\) contribution it was assumed that this channel behaves similarly to the tb and tc channels (Table 10). The resulting acceptance before jet veto is a factor of 4.7 higher and after jet veto a factor of 2.7 higher for the \(\mathrm{W}\rightarrow\tau\nu\) final state than for the \(\mathrm{W}\rightarrow\ell\nu\) final state.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|} \hline \hline Cumulative & Without ”LVL1” & With ”LVL1” \\ acceptance & & & \\ \hline \multicolumn{3}{|c|}{at least one \(\mathrm{W}\rightarrow\tau\nu\)} \\ \hline \(\mathrm{E}_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}+\mathrm{lepton}\) veto & 47.9\% & 34.3\% \\ \hline \(+\,2\,\,\mathrm{b}\)-labelled jets & 27.0\% & 19.5\% \\ \hline \(+\,\mathrm{jet}\) veto 30 GeV & 0.16\% & 0.13\% \\ \hline \multicolumn{3}{|c|}{at least one \(\mathrm{W}\rightarrow\ell\nu\)} \\ \hline \(\mathrm{E}_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}+\mathrm{lepton}\) veto & 12.4\% & 8.7\% \\ \hline \(+\,2\,\,\mathrm{b}\)-labelled jets & 6.5\% & 4.6\% \\ \hline \(+\,\mathrm{jet}\) veto 30 GeV & 0.09\% & 0.06\% \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 9: _For the \(\mathrm{t}\overline{\mathrm{t}}\) background, cumulative acceptances of the selection criteria._

The rejection of these events is therefore a factor 11 higher than in the case of \(\ell b\overline{b}\) final states (see Section 2.3.3 of [3]). After jet veto, the expected number of \(\mathrm{W^{*}\rightarrow\mathrm{tb}}\) events is a factor of four smaller than the expected number of signal events. This background will therefore contribute marginally to the backgrounds to the \(\mathrm{E_{T}^{miss}+b\overline{b}}\) signature.

Table 12 shows a summary of the expected backgrounds from top production.

### Total signal and non-QCD backgrounds

The expected number of signal and background events with \(\mathrm{Z}\) or \(\mathrm{W}\) in the final state is given in Table 13 for the selection without and with jet veto. Even if the total background to this channel was dominated by events with true missing transverse energy, \(E_{T}^{\nu}\), from \(\mathrm{W}\) or \(\mathrm{Z}\) decays, a sensitivity of only \(3\sigma\) could be expected for an integrated luminosity of \(30\) fb\({}^{-1}\). The suppression of the single top and \(\mathrm{t\bar{t}}\) backgrounds with jet veto leads to a more favourable signal-to-background ratio than for the Higgs searches in the \(\ell b\overline{b}\) final state. The signal-to-resonant-background ratio, here only 1:2, is however less favourable than for the \(\ell b\overline{b}\) signature. Obviously, the jet veto combined with the lepton veto suppresses more efficiently the \(\mathrm{Wjj}\) than the \(\mathrm{Zjj}\) background. With a jet veto at 30 GeV, the \(\mathrm{Zb\bar{b}}\) channel with \(\mathrm{Z}\rightarrow\nu\nu\) becomes the dominant background source with real \(E_{T}^{\nu}\) from \(\mathrm{W}\) or \(\mathrm{Z}\) production.

### The QCD background

The QCD background has a cross-section which is several orders of magnitude higher than that for the other background processes (e.g. \(10^{6}\) times higher than the Z+jet and \(10^{5}\) times higher than W+jet cross-sections). The inclusive production of \(b\overline{b}\) events alone is of the order of 500 \(\mu\)_b_[1]. Missing transverse energy in such events is expected mainly from mismeasured jets and from leptonic decays inside jets. For example, QCD \(b\overline{b}\) events selected by requiring \(\rm E_{T}^{miss}~{}>~{}30~{}\,GeV\), in around 38% of cases contain true missing transverse energy \(\rm E_{T}^{\nu}~{}>~{}30~{}\,GeV\).

To suppress more efficiently the QCD background an additional cut requiring isolation of the reconstructed missing transverse energy, from any reconstructed jet with \(\rm p_{T}~{}>~{}15.0~{}\,GeV\) (before recalibration) and \(|\eta|~{}<~{}5.0\), the \(\Delta\phi(\rm E_{T}^{miss},jet)~{}>~{}0.5\), is used.

In the following, the QCD background and the ZH signal are analysed with this additional requirement. In this case the selection criteria have been applied in different order than in the analysis presented in the previous sections. This allows the acceptances for the jet and lepton veto and for the \(\rm E_{T}^{miss}\) isolation to be studied separately.

The acceptance of the initial cuts, as shown already in Table 2, is 15.2% (with jet veto) for ZH signal events with \(Z\to\nu\,\nu\) and \(H\to b\overline{b}\). It includes the efficiency for the \(\rm E_{T}^{miss}~{}>~{}30~{}\,GeV\) cut ( 77%), b-jet labelling (40%) and jet veto (49%). In almost 100% of the cases the events have true missing transverse energy, \(\rm E_{T}^{\nu}\), above 30 GeV. For the purpose of comparison with the QCD background discussed in the following, Table 14 shows the expected numbers of signal events as a function of the \(\rm E_{T}^{miss}\) threshold and at different steps of the selection.

After all cuts about 240 events with \(\rm E_{T}^{miss}~{}>~{}30~{}\,GeV\) are expected (see Table 20). If the \(\rm E_{T}^{miss}\) cut is raised to 50 GeV the expected number of signal events is reduced to \(\sim 180\).

The contribution of the QCD background was estimated from samples of direct heavy flavour production, \(\rm gg,q\bar{q}\to b\bar{b}\), and from QCD di-jet production. The \(\rm gg,q\bar{q}\to b\bar{b}\) sample was used as a control sample as it gives a lower limit on the expected background. It can be generated much more efficiently than the inclusive \(\rm QCD\to b\bar{b}\) background 2. A consistency check was also performed by comparing the \(\rm gg,q\bar{q}\to b\bar{b}\) contribution estimated from an inclusive QCD sample and from a dedicated generation. Initial cross-sections

The b-tagging efficiency is not included._for these two samples are given in Table 15 for various \(\rm p_{T}^{hard}\) bins. Tables 16 and 17 show the acceptances of the selection criteria for different types of QCD events.

Only events with \(\rm p_{T}^{hard}~{}>~{}30\) GeV were analysed for both \(\rm QCD\to b\bar{b}\) and \(\rm gg,q\bar{q}\to b\bar{b}\). This because of the limited available CPU, and given the extremely small acceptance for inclusive QCD events generated with low \(\rm p_{T}^{hard}\). For \(\rm p_{T}^{hard}~{}<~{}30\) GeV, bringing the cross-section of the QCD background down to the level of the signal cross-section would require a rejection of \(\sim 10^{10}\). Such studies would therefore require the simulation of at least \(\sim 10^{11}\) events. For the \(gg,q\bar{q}\to b\bar{b}\) sample, on the other hand, the required statistics is of \(10^{7}\) events. Indeed, the contribution from the \(\rm p_{T}^{hard}~{}=10-30\) GeV range was found to be the dominant one for the total \(gg,q\bar{q}\to b\bar{b}\) background.

Table 18 shows the expected number of events as a function of the selection and the \(\rm E_{T}^{miss}\) threshold, for \(gg,q\bar{q}\to b\bar{b}\) events generated in the \(\rm p_{T}^{hard}~{}=10-30\) GeV range. The expected number of events, estimated from samples generated with \(\rm p_{T}^{hard}~{}>~{}30\) GeV, are given in Table 19 for both inclusive QCD and the \(gg,q\bar{q}\to b\bar{b}\).

For the final estimates of the number of expected events it was assumed that in the range \(\rm p_{T}^{hard}~{}=~{}10-30\) GeV the direct \(gg,q\bar{q}\to b\bar{b}\) production contributes 20% to the total \(QCD\to b\bar{b}\) events ( as it is in the case of the \(\rm p_{T}^{hard}~{}>~{}30\) GeV region). The numbers obtained for the \(gg,q\bar{q}\to b\bar{b}\) sample were therefore rescaled accordingly. The acceptance of 20-30% was estimated for the mass window \(\rm m_{b\,b}\) = 100 \(\pm\) 20 GeV and is included in a given number.

The total QCD background is dominated by true \(b\bar{b}\) events. However, the contribution from the direct heavy flavour production, \(gg,q\bar{q}\to b\bar{b}\), is only 20% (this contribution is of 30% for the inclusive \(\rm b\bar{b}\) production). About 1-3% of the selected events have true missing transverse energy \(\rm E_{T}^{\nu}~{}>~{}30\) GeV.

* 30% acceptance in the mass window is assumed, the expected background is smaller than \(10^{5}\) events.
* The QCD di-jet contribution to the events with jj pairs is negligible, i.e. 100 \(\pm\) 30 events at most. This results was obtained before applying jet veto and lepton veto cuts.

The QCD background is by far the dominant one for the \(\mathrm{E_{T}^{miss}+b\bar{b}}\) signature. For a \(\mathrm{E_{T}^{miss}\ cut}\) at 30 GeV it is a factor of \(5\cdot 10^{2}\) higher than the total background from W, Z and top production. The expected ZH signal and QCD background after all cuts are given in Table 20.

### Conclusions

A study of the observability of WH/ZH production in the \(\mathrm{E_{T}^{miss}+b\bar{b}}\) channel at LHC has been made. If only background processes with W and Z bosons in the final state are considered, a signal significance of at most \(3\sigma\) could be expected for an integrated luminosity of 30 \(fb^{-1}\). The background in this case would be dominated by true \(\mathrm{Zb\bar{b}}\) events.

However, if also the huge QCD background is taken into account this channel becomes hopeless. Even with a high \(\mathrm{E_{T}^{miss}\ cut}\), e.g. \(\mathrm{E_{T}^{miss}>50}\) GeV, the expected signal-to-background ratio is below 0.15% and the expected sensitivity is below 1\(\sigma\) for an integrated luminosity of 30 fb\({}^{-1}\). These results are very optimistic since the fast simulation, used here to describe the detector performance, is not adequate to model the contribution of jets backgrounds to events with \(\mathrm{E_{T}^{miss}}\). In addition, the issue of the feasibility and efficiency of a trigger for such events was not considered here.

## 5 2 TeV \(\mathrm{p\bar{p}}\) versus 14 TeV pp

A quantitative comparison of the expected potential of the Tevatron and LHC for the \(\mathrm{WH/ZH}\) channel with the \(\mathrm{E_{T}^{miss}+b\bar{b}}\) signature has been performed assuming the same performance of the detectors at both colliders, namely efficiencies for jet and lepton reconstruction, b-jet tagging, jet veto and \(\mathrm{E_{T}^{miss}}\) resolution.

For this comparison the following selection criteria were used:

* \(\mathrm{E_{T}^{miss}}~{}>~{}30~{}\mathrm{GeV}\).
* For the cases called (1) and (2), the geometrical coverage of the ATLAS detector and the selection criteria discussed in the previous Section have been used. Differences in acceptances and expected rates are therefore directly related to differences in the cross-sections and kinematic features of the events (e.g. events at 2 TeV are more central than at 14 TeV).
* For the case called (3), a reduced geometrical coverage and slightly different selection criteria, as specified in the Tevatron report [2], have been used:
* b-tagging and lepton coverage over \(|\eta|~{}<~{}2.0\);
* veto lepton with \(\mathrm{p_{T}}~{}>~{}10~{}\mathrm{GeV}\);
* no jets with \(\mathrm{p_{T}}~{}>~{}30~{}\mathrm{GeV}\) and \(|\eta|<2.5\), no more than one jet with with \(\mathrm{p_{T}}~{}>~{}15~{}\mathrm{GeV}\) (before recalibration).
* A b-tagging efficiency of 60% efficiency for b-jets, with a rejection of 10 against c-jets and 100 against light jets.
* A mass window of \(100\pm 20~{}\mathrm{GeV}\). The signal acceptance in this window is 85%.

For the comparison of the ATLAS potential and the potential claimed in the Tevatron report [2] we compare to the cases (1) and (3). These take into account differences in the geometrical acceptance of the detectors at the two colliders and the different optimisation of the selection criteria.

### \(\mathrm{ZH}\) and \(\mathrm{WH}\) signals

The total acceptance for signal events is higher at 2 TeV (3) than at 14 TeV (1), see Table 21. The acceptance for the \(\mathrm{E_{T}^{miss}}\) and lepton veto cuts is comparable except for the \(\mathrm{WH}\), \(\mathrm{W}\rightarrow\ell\nu\) channel for which it is higher by a factor of 2.6 at 14 TeV. The final acceptance after jet veto is higher at 2 TeV by a factor of 2 for the \(\mathrm{Z}\rightarrow\nu\nu\) and \(\mathrm{W}\rightarrow\ell\nu\) channels and by a factor 3 for the \(\mathrm{Z}\rightarrow\tau\tau\) and \(\mathrm{W}\rightarrow\tau\nu\) channels. This is mostly due to the softer jet veto applied in the case (3).

### ZZ and WZ resonant background

Similarly to the signal, the acceptance for these resonant backgrounds is higher by factor of two for \(\mathrm{Z\to\nu\nu}\) and \(\mathrm{W\to\ell\,\nu}\) and by a factor of three for the \(\mathrm{Z\to\tau\tau}\) and \(\mathrm{W\to\tau\nu}\) channels in the 2 TeV scenario, see Table 23. Taking into account also the initial cross-sections, the final rates for these backgrounds are larger by a factor of five in the 14 TeV scenario, see Table 24. Since the signal rate is also larger by a factor four at 14 TeV, the signal-to-resonant-background ratio is only slightly worse in the 14 TeV scenario and in the 2 TeV scenario.

### Zjj and Wjj backgrounds

The Zjj with \(\mathrm{Z}\to\nu\nu\) and Wjj with \(\mathrm{W}\to\ell\nu\) events were simulated with PYTHIA. The contribution from events with \(\mathrm{Z}\to\tau\tau\) decays is negligible and for simplicity it was omitted. The contribution from \(\mathrm{W}\to\tau\nu\) events was estimated assuming the same ratio of acceptances as for the WZ events with \(\mathrm{W}\to\tau\nu\) and \(\mathrm{W}\to\ell\nu\).

The contribution from \(\mathrm{Z}\mathrm{b}\overline{\mathrm{b}}\) events dominates (almost 90%) the total Zjj background. The expected rate in the mass window is a factor almost 30 higher in the 14 TeV scenario. The contribution from \(\mathrm{W}\mathrm{b}\overline{\mathrm{b}}\) is less important, amounting to about 40% of the total Wjj background for the 2 TeV \(\mathrm{p}\overline{\mathrm{p}}\) case and to 70% for the 14 TeV pp case. Also expected ratio of rates is higher with the 14 TeV scenario, being for the \(\mathrm{W}\to\ell\nu\) events almost 20.

### Top pair and single top background

\(\bullet\)\(\mathrm{t\bar{t}}\) background

With the tighter jet veto used at 14 TeV, the acceptance is eight times smaller for \(\mathrm{W\to\tau\nu}\) decays and five times smaller for \(\mathrm{W\to\ell\nu}\) decays than in the 2 TeV case. The final rate of this background after all cuts is 15 times higher in the 14 TeV scenario. However it only contributes a few percent to the total background.

\(\bullet\)**Single top background**

With the tighter jet veto used at 14 TeV, the acceptance is three times smaller for \(\mathrm{W\to\tau\nu}\) decays and five times smaller for \(\mathrm{W\to\ell\nu}\) decays in the 2 TeV. The final rates of this background after all cuts is eight times higher in the 14 TeV scenario. However it only contributes below one percent to the total background.

This background, similarly as for the \(\ell b\overline{b}\) signature, is rather small. Only the W \(\rightarrow\ell\,\nu\) decay mode could be simulated with available version of the HERWIG Monte Carlo. It was therefore assumed that this channel behaves similarly to the tb, tc single production, see Table 29, so that the acceptance before jet veto is 6.2 higher and after jet-veto is 1.6 higher for the W \(\rightarrow\tau\,\nu\) than for the W \(\rightarrow\ell\nu\) final state.

With rather tighter jet-veto used at 14 TeV the total acceptance is 2.5 times lower. The rate of this background after all cuts is only 6 times higher at 14 TeV scenario. However it contributes a few percent to the total background.

\(\bullet\)**Total background from top events**

The total background from the top events (single and pair production) is given in Table 31. At 14 TeV it is higher by factor of 15 for top-pair production and by factor of eight for single top production.

### Total signal and non-QCD backgrounds

Table 32 compares the expected signal and background rates in the 14 TeV pp and 2 TeV p\(\bar{\rm p}\) scenarios after all cuts. The expected signal is a factor of four higher and the background a factor of 20 higher at 14 TeV.

Omitting the QCD background (see Section 5.6), the sensitivity to this channel in terms of \(S/\sqrt{B}\) is comparable for the 14 TeV pp and 2 TeV p\(\bar{\rm p}\) cases, and is 3 \(\sigma\) for an integrated luminosity of 30 fb\({}^{-1}\).

However, the overwhelming QCD background reduces this sensitivity significantly in both cases, as discussed in the next Section.

### The QCD background

The QCD background for \(2\,\,\mathrm{TeV}\)\(\mathrm{p}\bar{\mathrm{p}}\) collisions, was generated with PYTHIA in a similar way as discussed in Section 4.6.

This study was done only for events with \(\mathrm{p}_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{hard}}\;>\;30\,\,\mathrm{GeV}\). As it can be concluded from the results presented in Section 4.6, the QCD background evaluated in this way might be significantly underestimated since the contribution from events with \(\mathrm{p}_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{hard}}\;<\;30\,\,\mathrm{GeV}\) is dominant. In that range, however, the available statistics was not sufficient for a reliable estimate of the background contribution.

For the study presented below the following selection criteria were used:

* \(\mathrm{E}_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\) was calculated from the reconstructed energy in the calorimeters over \(|\eta|\;<\;5.0\).
* \(\Delta\phi(\mathrm{E}_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}},\mathrm{jet})\;>\;0.5\).
* Two b-tagged jets within \(|\eta|\;<\;2.0\) and \(\mathrm{p}_{\mathrm{T}}\;>\;15\,\,\mathrm{GeV}\); before recalibration.
* No additional jets with \(\mathrm{p}_{\mathrm{T}}\;>\;30\,\,\mathrm{GeV}\) and no more than one jet \(\mathrm{p}_{\mathrm{T}}\;>\;15\,\,\mathrm{GeV}\) over \(|\eta|\;<\;2.5\) (before recalibration).
* No isolated lepton with \(|\eta|\;<\;2.0\) and \(\mathrm{p}_{\mathrm{T}}\;>\;10\,\,\mathrm{GeV}\).
* This additional selection was introduced to achieve a better rejection: \(\Delta\phi(\mathrm{E}_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}},\mathrm{jet})\;>\;1.0\) and \(\Delta\phi(\mathrm{jet}_{1},\mathrm{jet}_{2})\;<\;2.6\)
* A b-tagging efficiency of 60% for b-jets, with a rejection of 10 against c-jets and 100 against light jets were used.
* A mass window 100 \(\pm\) 20 \(\,\mathrm{GeV}\) was used and an acceptance of 85% inside this window.

The acceptance of the initial selection criteria is 38% for the ZH signal with \(Z\to\nu\nu\). It includes the acceptance for the \(\mathrm{E}_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\;>\;30\,\,\mathrm{GeV}\) cut (80%) and for 2 b-tagged jets (48%). In almost 100% of cases, the signal events have \(\mathrm{E}_{\mathrm{T}}^{\nu}\;>\;30\,\,\mathrm{GeV}\).

After the additional selection criteria, (see Table 33), about 135 events are expected with \(\mathrm{E}_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\;>\;35\,\,\mathrm{GeV}\) (b-tagging efficiency not included). After including the b-tagging efficiency this number would be reduced to 50 events (see Table 38). If the \(\mathrm{E}_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\) cut was raised to 50 GeV the rate would be further reduced to 40 events.

The contribution from QCD events was estimated from a sample of direct \(b\bar{b}\) production, \(gg,q\bar{q}\to b\bar{b}\), and from a sample of QCD di-jet. The sample of \(gg,q\bar{q}\to b\bar{b}\) was used as a control sample.

In Table 34 the initial cross-sections are shown for various \(p_{T}^{hard}\) bins. The pre-selection efficiency is also specified (events were preselected by requiring \(\mathrm{E}_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\;>\;30\,\,\mathrm{GeV}\) and 2 jets with \(\mathrm{p}_{\mathrm{T}}\;>\;15\,\,\mathrm{GeV}\) (before recalibration) over \(|\eta|\;<\;2.5\)). A total of \(10^{8}\) events were analysed for this study, using ATLFAST.

Tables 35 - 37 give details on the cumulative acceptances for the QCD background. Table 38 specifies expected number of events for an integrated luminosity of 30 \(fb^{-1}\) and for different thresholds on the \(\mathrm{E}_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\). The set of distributions, which are relevant for the selection algorithm, are presented in Figs.1-4 for signal and different types of QCD background.

The cut aimed at rejecting events with non-isolated \(\rm E_{T}^{miss}\), i.e. \(\rm\Delta\phi(E_{T}^{miss},j)>0.5\), reduces \(gg,q\bar{q}\to b\bar{b}\) by a factor of 40 and \(\rm QCD\to b\bar{b}\) by a factor of 10 (see Figs. 1-4).

This strong dependence of the background rate and the exact value of the cuts on the \(\rm E_{T}^{miss}\) threshold and isolation indicate that a solid estimation of this background can be only made with full detector simulation. The fast simulation, used here, can only provide the order of magnitude and most likely underestimates the background level.

The QCD background is overwhelming for the ZH channel. The additional selection s-lightly increases the signal-to-background ratio (e.g. from 3.6% to 3.8% for \(\rm E_{T}^{miss}~{}>~{}40\) GeV) but reduces \(S/\sqrt{B}\) (from 1.4 to 1.3 for \(\rm E_{T}^{miss}~{}>~{}40\) GeV).

### Conclusions

A detailed comparison of the observability of the WH/ZH channels with a \(\rm E_{T}^{miss}~{}+~{}b\bar{b}\) signature was performed on for the 14 TeV pp and the 2 TeV \(\rm p\bar{p}\) scenarios. If only background processes with W and Z bosons in the final state are considered, the significance would be comparable in both scenarios, and would be \(3\sigma\) for an integrated luminosity 30 \(fb^{-1}\). At 14 TeV the expected signal is four times higher and the expected resonant background 5.5 times higher, giving a less favourable signal-to-resonant-background ratio. The signal-to-background ratio is a factor of five higher at 2 TeV.

The QCD reducible background is overwhelming at 14 TeV and is dominant at 2 TeV. It is at least five times higher at 2 TeV and 50 times higher at 14 TeV than the background from W and Z production (for \(\rm E_{T}^{miss}~{}>~{}35\) GeV). If this background is included, the final expected significance is reduced below \(2\sigma\) for 2 TeV \(\rm p\bar{p}\) collisions and below \(1\sigma\) for 14 TeV pp collisions.

### Comparison with results from Tevatron report [2]

Two different analyses are presented in [2], based on the so called _QFL_ and _SHW_ simulations of the detector performance. The proposed selection criteria differ slightly between these two analyses, leading however to comparable signal significances in both cases.

In Table 39 a detailed comparison between the results of this study and those reported in [2] for the SHW analysis is shown. There are differences in the assumed detector performance. The main issues of the detector performance for these channels are the \(\rm E_{T}^{miss}\) resolution, the b-tagging efficiency and non-b jet rejection and the efficiencies for the jet reconstruction and veto. A \(10\,\%\)\(\rm b\overline{b}\) mass resolution was assumed as it is used in the Tevatron report for the SHW analysis.

In the following the label _This study_ indicates an analysis based on the ATLAS detector performance, but the selection criteria proposed in the Tevatron report. These include reduced pseudorapidity coverage and softer jet veto, as mentioned in Section 3, and the additional cut \(\Delta\phi(\rm E_{T}^{miss},jet)\ >\ 0.5\).

The label _This study scaled_ indicates an analysis where the efficiency for double b-tag was rescaled for the signal and non-QCD backgrounds to reproduce that reported for the signal in [2]. The needed scaling factor was 2.5. The QCD background was not rescaled.

There are several disagreements in the signal and background estimates between this study and the Tevatron study.

* The total signal and resonant background rates after all cuts are a factor of two higher in [2] than in this study which comes mostly from the higher efficiency for double b-tag assumed in [2].
* The total rate of the background from W, Z, t, \(\rm t\overline{t}\) production is in agreement between the two studies, which is accidental since the individual backgrounds, e.g. Wjj and Zjj, t and \(\rm t\overline{t}\) are not in agreement. This agreement is even more strange since the assumed efficiency for double b-tag is a factor of two higher in [2] so the background should be a factor of two higher than in this study as it is the case for the signal and the resonant background.
* The QCD background as estimated in this study, is at least five times higher than the total W, Z, t, \(\rm t\overline{t}\) background. Only recently this background has been included in the Tevatron study, compare [2, 12] and [13] and is estimated to be similar to the total W, Z, t, \(\rm t\overline{t}\) background.

The QCD background reported in [2] was obtained by extrapolating from the Run I Higgs search results. It is also argued, that with tighter selection criteria it will be possible to suppress this background even more efficiently. It is also stressed made that this background cannot be determined reliably from Monte Carlo simulation and that data are needed for this purpose.

It should however be noted that background significantly larger than that estimated in [2], which is suggested by the study presented here, would drastically reduce the prospects for the Higgs observation with the \(\rm E_{T}^{miss}+b\overline{b}\) signature at the Tevatron Run II.

Conclusions

The primary aim of this paper was to discuss the differences in the expected potential for the Higgs boson discovery in the WH/ZH channel, with \(\mathrm{E_{T}^{miss}+b\bar{b}}\) signature, in 2 TeV \(\mathrm{p\bar{p}}\) and 14 TeV pp collisions.

This signature is considered since a long time as not accessible at LHC [1], but a more quantitative evaluation has been presented in this paper. This channel was confirmed to be hopeless because of the overwhelming background from QCD di-jet production. Even if only the background from W, Z, \(\mathrm{t\bar{t}}\) production was present, the expected significance would be about \(3\sigma\) for an integrated luminosity of 30 \(fb^{-1}\).

A detailed comparison of the expected signal and backgrounds, expected at LHC and Tevatron Run II was performed assuming the same detector performance in both cases and ATLAS or Tevatron like selection criteria. The results obtained in this study for the \(\mathrm{p\bar{p}}\) scenario are much less optimistic than those presented in the Tevatron report [2].

It was found that WH/ZH channel with \(\mathrm{E_{T}^{miss}+b\bar{b}}\) signature might be overwhelmed by QCD background. This would substantially reduce not only the prospects for the observation of this channel alone but also the overall potential for Higgs searches at the Tevatron.
