The Standard Model higgs decay in the mass range above \(\sim\)130 GeV receives a large contribution from the WW\({}^{\ast}\) and the ZZ\({}^{\ast}\) decay mode. A large amount of work has already been done to enhance the Higgs boson signal over contributions from reducible background (\(t\bar{t}\), \(Zb\bar{b}\)) [1].

In order to reduce the contribution of irreducible backrounds, one is led to use production properties like total \(p_{T}\) or angular correlations in the subsequent decays of the gauge bosons. It is the aim of this note to explore these possibilities. The first part describes the analysis based on the 4 leptons reconstructed \(p_{T}\) and on the related angular distribution between the Z and the \(Z^{\star}\).

The second part is dedicated to the angular correlations study, with also the presentation of the \(H\to ZZ^{\star}\to 4l\) matrix element calculation which aims to complete the PYTHIA generator.

## 1 Introduction

The search for the \(H\to 4l\)\((4e,4\mu,2e2\mu)\) with the ATLAS detector relies on a set of kinematic, isolation and impact parameter cuts, devoted to the reduction of the reducible \(t\overline{t}\) and \(Zb\overline{b}\) backgrounds well below the irreducible one (\(ZZ^{\star}/\gamma^{\star}\)). In this paper, we are studying more deeply the irreducible background by looking at the Higgs reconstructed \(p_{T}\) and at the angular correlation between the outgoing leptons, with the aim to evaluate the possibility to increase the \(ZZ^{\star}\) rejection and to better understand its properties.

## 2 Higgs reconstructed \(p_{T}\)

### Basics of the analysis

Due to a difference in the production processes, the signal and the irreducible background show very different distributions for the Higgs reconstructed \(p_{T}\) calculated with the four leptons momenta :

\[p_{T_{4l}}=(\Sigma_{i}\ \vec{p_{l}}^{\star})_{T}=p_{T_{H}}\]

The dominant diagram for the Higgs production at LHC, is the fusion of two gluons via a top quark loop (Table 2.1 and fig 1). On the contrary, the \(ZZ^{\star}\) continuum is mainly created via the scattering of two quarks (fig 2). The difference is important because the capability for the incoming partons to radiate in the initial state is different in the two processes. It is expressed in the \(C_{F}\) colour factor in the Sudakov Term1. The reconstructed \(p_{T_{4l}}\) for the \(ZZ^{\star}\) is thus about the half of the Higgs one (fig 3).

This may provide us with the possibility to discriminate a bit more the signal and the background.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|c|c|} \hline  & total & gg & WW,ZZ fusion & \(t\bar{t}\) \\ \hline \(m_{\,H}=130\) GeV & 18.9 (pb) & 71\% & 22\% & 7\% \\ \hline \(m_{\,H}=150\) GeV & 15.2 (pb) & 70\% & 24.5\% & 5.5\% \\ \hline \(m_{\,H}=170\) GeV & 12.9 (pb) & 70\% & 25\% & 5\% \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}

The analysis based on \(p_{T_{\rm cl}}\), is completed by another one, strongly correlated, relying on the angle separating the directions of the reconstructed \(Z\) and \(Z^{\star}\). This second cut depends moreover on the \(Z/Z^{\star}\) mass difference (\(\Delta_{m_{Z}}=m_{Z}-m_{Z^{\star}}\)), which is larger for the \(ZZ^{\star}\) than for the Higgs (fig 4), because the \(ZZ^{\star}\) background is mainly produced in the t channel.

We are working with a \(H\to ZZ^{\star}\to 4l\) sample for \(m_{H}=130\) GeV and \(m_{H}=170\) GeV, generated with PYTHIA 5.7 [6]. The production processes are selected in PYTHIA with MSEL=16, including the gluon-gluon fusion, the WW and ZZ fusion and the \(t\overline{t}\) fusion. The top mass has been set to \(m_{t}=170\) GeV.

The \(ZZ^{\star}\to 4l\) sample has also been generated with PYTHIA 5.7, but we have to point out that this version of PYTHIA does not include the \(gg\to ZZ^{\star}\) contribution to the \(ZZ^{\star}\) production, which would tend to increase \(p_{T_{\rm cl}}\).

Some theoretical calculations have estimated this contribution to be of the order of 23% of the total cross section [2]. This absence have to be keep in mind when interpreting the results.

### Event selections

In a first time, we have evaluated in term of rejection, the difference between the \(H\to 4l\) and the \(ZZ^{\star}\) background using this \(p_{T_{\rm cl}}\) criterium.

The analysis has been done at particle level. To take into account the detector effects, the leptons momenta have been smeared according to the resolution parametrisation of the calorimeter (electrons) and of the inner tracker (muons) [3].

It has been shown in [3] that the tracker angular resolution is of the order of a fraction of mrad both for the electrons and the muons. This allows to use directly the generated angles for the direction reconstruction.

The effects of the kinematic cuts have been included using the selection on the four leptons defined in the previous analysis [4][5]:

* 2 leptons with \(p_{T}>20\) GeV in a rapidity range \(|\eta|<2.7\)2 are required to trigger the experiment. Footnote 2: To increase the statistics. In atlas we currently use : \(|\eta|<2.5\)
* Two additional leptons with \(p_{T_{\rm cl}ov}>7\) GeV and \(|\eta|<2.7\) are also required.
* The reconstructed mass of two of them has to point to the Z mass : \(M_{12}=m_{Z}\pm 6\) GeV. This cut reduces the non-resonant \(t\overline{t}\) background.
* And the invariant mass of the two other (\(m_{34}\) called \(m_{Z}^{\star}\) in the foloowing) must follows : \(M_{Z^{\star}}>20\) GeV. This last cut reduces both the contributionsfrom cascades decays to the \(Zb\bar{b}\) background, and the contributions of the \(\gamma^{\star}\) pole to the irreducible \(ZZ^{\star}\) background.

To eliminate any correlation between \(m_{\,4l}\) and \(p_{T_{4l}}\) distribution, the events from the \(ZZ^{\star}\) background have been filtered to have a 4 leptons reconstructed mass pointing to the studied Higgs mass (\(m_{\,4l}=m_{\,H}\pm 15\) GeV).

### Rejections

#### 2.3.1 First method : \(p_{T_{4l}}\)

With these conditions, for \(m_{\,H}=130\) GeV, a cut on \(p_{T_{4}}\) rejects half of the \(ZZ^{\star}\) background for an efficiency \(\epsilon=85\%\) (Fig:5).

When the Higgs mass is increased to \(m_{\,H}=170\) GeV,the mean reconstructed \(p_{T}\) of both the signal and the \(ZZ^{\star}\), increase somewhat in the same proportion, and the rejection power is nearly constant on the mass range (130-170) GeV.

To account for the \(gg\to ZZ^{\star}\), we consider in a conservative way that this process would add some events that can not be separated from the Higgs.

With \(N_{qq+gg}=N_{qq}\times 1.3\), the rejection will become :

\[R_{qq\,+gg}=\frac{N_{qq\,+gg}}{N_{qq\,+gg}^{cut}}=\frac{1.3N_{qq}}{(N_{qq}^{ cut}+0.3N_{qq})}=\frac{1.3N_{qq}}{(\frac{N_{qq}}{R_{qq}}+0.3N_{qq})}\]

In this case for \(\epsilon=85\%,\;R\to 1.65\).

This last rejection factor gives a slight improvement of 10% in the significance for the signal (\(\frac{S}{\sqrt{B}}\)).

#### 2.3.2 Second method : Angle between the Z and the \(Z^{\star}\)

The difference in the \(p_{T_{4l}}\) distributions affects the kinematics of the Higgs decay. This tends to favour low azimuthal angle between the \(Z\) and the \(Z^{\star}\) (fig 6). The following variable has been defined :

\[A_{\,S}=|\pi-|(\Phi_{Z}-\Phi_{Z^{\star}})|\|\]

\(A_{\,S}\to 0\) when the Z and the \(Z^{\star}\) are emitted back to back, and \(A_{\,S}\rightarrow\pi\) when the Z and the \(Z^{\star}\) are emitted in the same direction..

Of course, no miraculous effect will be obtained from this variable with respect to \(p_{T_{4l}}\) (fig 5). But as we can see on (fig 7), the shapes of the \(A_{\,S}\) distributions are different for the Higgs and \(ZZ^{\star}\). The amount of events that can be separatedwith this graphic is not larger than the one with \(p_{T_{\rm cl}}\), but it depends less on the cut variation and allows an easier visual distinction.

The figure (fig 8) shows the shape of this variable for both the signal and the backgrounds after one year of LHC at high luminosity. The distributions are scaled to the number of events that will be obtained after the rejection of the backgrounds using the kinematics, the isolation and the impact parameter cuts.

### \(Zb\overline{b}\) and \(t\overline{t}\)

One can not hope to use the \(p_{\!T}\) criterium for the \(t\overline{t}\) or \(Zb\overline{b}\) rejection, because the \(p_{T_{\rm cl}}\) of the four leptons is relatively high and does not differ from the Higgs one.

For the \(Zb\overline{b}\), as a real Z is emitted in the final state, the reconstructed Z and \(Z^{*}\) tend to be emitted back to back if the mass of the \(Z^{*}\) is small (fig 9, fig 10). This effect could be interesting to reject a part of the \(Zb\overline{b}\), but as it is strongly correlated to \(m_{Z^{*}}\), the kinematic cut \(m_{Z^{*}}>20\) GeV suppresses a large part of these events, and the distribution of \(A_{S}\) after this kinematic cut does not differ significantly from the Higgs one (fig 11).

## 3 Angular correlations in \(H^{0}\to ZZ^{\star}\to 4l\).

### Introduction

Contrary to the \(ZZ^{\star}\)background, the \(H^{0}\to ZZ^{\star}\) process induces some angular correlations between the four leptons. The study of such an effect is not possible with PYTHIA 5.7 which does not include the complete matrix element for the \(H\to ZZ^{\star}\) decay [6][7]. Indeed this decay is treated as a \(H\to WW\) decay with the appropriate particles masses. This doesn't affect the common kinematical variables, but it doesn't describe correctly the angular correlations between the final lepton...

To do the analysis we have calculated the right \(H^{0}\to ZZ^{\star}\) matrix element, and performed a specific generator to generate the Higgs events. We present below a brief description of the computation of the matrix element, including a comparison to the \(H\to W^{+}W^{-}\) matrix element, with the aim to understand the differencies between the two approaches.

A discussion of the obtained distributions, and the consequences for the physics will follow in the last paragraph.

### Matrix element computation

To introduce the differences between the Higgs decay into \(W^{+}W^{-}\) and \(ZZ\), we first describe the decay in only two real bosons.

Then in a second part, the calculation for the complete channels leading to \(4l\) or \(2l2\nu\) states is fully described.

The following notations are used :

\(m_{\,H},\,m_{\,W},\,m_{\,Z}\) are the Higgs, W and Z masses, and \(g=e/\sin\,\theta_{W},\,g_{\,Z}=g/\cos\,\theta_{W}\) are the coupling constants.

### Two real bosons decay

#### 3.3.1 H\(\rightarrow\)WW

We describe there the expression of the simple \(H\to WW\) matrix element.

it is :

\[i{\cal M}=igm_{\,W}\;g_{\mu\nu}\epsilon_{+}^{\mu}\epsilon_{-}^{\nu}\quad.\]

After squaring and summing over W polarisation states :

\[\epsilon^{\mu}\epsilon^{\ast\nu}\rightarrow-g_{\mu\nu}+\frac{q_{\mu}q_{\nu}}{ m_{\,W}^{2}}\quad,\]We get

\[|{\cal M}|^{2}=g^{2}m_{W}^{2}\left[2+\frac{(q_{+}\cdot q_{-})^{2}}{m_{W}^{4}} \right]\quad.\]

\(q_{+}\) and \(q_{-}\) are the quadri-momenta of the emitted \(W^{+-}\).

As \(m_{H}^{2}=(q_{+}+q_{-})^{2}=2m_{W}^{2}+2q_{+}\cdot q_{-}\), it becomes :

\[|{\cal M}|^{2}=g^{2}\,\frac{m_{H}^{4}}{4m_{W}^{2}}\left[\frac{x_{W}^{2}}{2}+ \left(1-\frac{x_{W}}{2}\right)^{2}\right]=g^{2}\frac{m_{H}^{4}}{4m_{W}^{2}} \left(1-x_{W}+\frac{3x_{W}^{2}}{4}\right)\quad. \tag{1}\]

Where \(x_{W}=4m_{W}^{2}/m_{H}^{2}\).

The partial width is then easily written :

\[\Gamma=\frac{(2\pi)^{4}}{2m_{H}}|{\cal M}|^{2}\,\frac{p^{*}\times 4\pi}{2^{8} \pi^{6}m_{H}}\quad,\]

and expressed as :

\[\Gamma(WW)=\frac{g^{2}}{64\pi}\frac{m_{H}^{3}}{m_{W}^{2}}\sqrt{1-x_{W}}\left( 1-x_{W}+\frac{3x_{W}^{2}}{4}\right)\quad. \tag{2}\]

It is the simple expression of the width of the Higgs into WW decay.

#### 3.3.2 H\(\rightarrow\)Zz

One has just to replace \(g\) by \(g_{Z}\), and \(m_{W}\) by \(m_{Z}\). A factor \(\frac{1}{2}\) arises from the fact that the phase space is symmetric on the two Z exchange.

\[\Gamma=\frac{(2\pi)^{4}}{2m_{H}}|{\cal M}|^{2}\frac{p^{*}\times 2\pi}{2^{8} \pi^{6}m_{H}}=\frac{g_{Z}^{2}}{128\pi}\frac{m_{H}^{3}}{m_{Z}^{2}}\sqrt{1-x_{z} }\left(1-x_{z}+\frac{3x_{z}^{2}}{4}\right)\quad,\]

We can express it in term of \(W\) and \(g\) :

\[\Gamma(ZZ)=\frac{g^{2}}{128\pi}\frac{m_{H}^{3}}{m_{W}^{2}}\sqrt{1-x_{z}}\left( 1-x_{z}+\frac{3x_{z}^{2}}{4}\right)\quad. \tag{3}\]

which is completely the equivalent of (2) for the Higgs decay into \(ZZ\). Similary to (2), we have defined in this formula : \(x_{z}=4m_{Z}^{2}/m_{H}^{2}\).

### Decay in two leptons pairs, General calculation

We consider now the general calculation for the Higgs decay... We are presenting there in a first part, the H\(\rightarrow\)WW\(\to l_{1}\overline{l}_{2}l_{3}\overline{l}_{4}\) calculation (where is either a lepton or a neutrino). In the next one, it will be straightforward to explain the counterpart for the H\(\rightarrow\) ZZ\(\to l_{1}\overline{l}_{2}l_{3}\overline{l}_{4}\) by applying the same transformations as for the precedent \(H^{0}\to ZZ^{\star}\) process.

#### 3.4.1 H\(\rightarrow\)WW\(\rightarrow\)\(l_{1}\,\overline{l}_{2}\,l_{3}\overline{l}_{4}\)

The matrix element is :

\[i{\cal M} = igm_{\,W}\;g_{\mu\nu}\] \[\times i\frac{-g^{\mu\,\rho}+q_{12}^{\,\mu}q_{12}^{\,\rho}/m_{\,W}^{2}}{M _{12}^{2}-m_{\,W}^{2}+im_{\,W}\Gamma}\times\,\frac{-ig}{\sqrt{2}}\overline{v}_ {2}\gamma_{\rho}\left(\frac{1-\gamma^{5}}{2}\right)\,u_{\,1}\] \[\times i\frac{-g^{\nu\,\sigma}+q_{34}^{\,\nu}q_{34}^{\,\sigma}/m_{\,W}^ {2}}{M_{34}^{2}-m_{\,W}^{2}+im_{\,W}\Gamma}\times\,\frac{-ig}{\sqrt{2}}\overline {v}_{4}\gamma_{\sigma}\left(\frac{1-\gamma^{5}}{2}\right)\,u_{3}\]

Using the current conservation property (\(q\cdot j=0\)), we have :

\[{\cal M}=\frac{g^{3}m_{W}}{2}\frac{1}{P_{12}\,P_{34}}\left[\overline{v}_{2} \gamma^{\mu}\left(\frac{1-\gamma^{5}}{2}\right)u_{\,1}\right]\left[\overline{v }_{4}\gamma_{\mu}\left(\frac{1-\gamma^{5}}{2}\right)u_{3}\right]\quad.\]

\(P_{12}\) and \(P_{34}\) are the respective propagators for the (12) and (34) systems. Squaring, and summing on the outgoing leptons polarisations, it becomes :

\[|{\cal M}|^{2} = \frac{g^{6}m_{W}^{2}}{4}BW(12)BW(34) \tag{4}\] \[\times Tr\left[p_{2}\gamma^{\mu}\left(\frac{1-\gamma^{5}}{2}\right)\,p_{ 1}\gamma^{\nu}\left(\frac{1-\gamma^{5}}{2}\right)\right]\] \[\times Tr\left[p_{4}\gamma^{\mu}\left(\frac{1-\gamma^{5}}{2}\right)\,p_{ 3}\gamma^{\nu}\left(\frac{1-\gamma^{5}}{2}\right)\right]\] \[= 4g^{6}m_{W}^{2}\frac{(p_{1}\cdot p_{3})(p_{2}\cdot p_{4})}{[(M_{ 12}^{2}-m_{\,W}^{2})^{2}+m_{\,W}^{2}\Gamma^{2}][(M_{34}^{2}-m_{\,W}^{2})^{2}+m _{\,W}^{2}\Gamma^{2}]}\quad.\]

We can then use the phase space term factorisation to simplify the equation :

\[d\Phi_{4}(1234;1,2,3,4) = d\Phi_{2}(1234;12,34)d\Phi_{2}(12;1,2)(2\pi)^{3}dM_{12}^{2} \tag{5}\] \[\times d\Phi_{2}(34;3,4)(2\pi)^{3}\,dM_{34}^{2}\]

with \(p^{*}=m_{\,H}\sqrt{1-x_{\,W}}/2\) we obtain the expression of the width for the decay of the Higgs into four leptons through the \(W^{+}W^{-}\) channel :

\[d\Gamma(H\to WW\to 4\,f)=\frac{g^{6}m_{W}^{2}}{2^{15}\pi^{8}m_{H}^{2}} \times\quad p^{*}(p_{1}\cdot p_{3})(p_{2}\cdot p_{4})\] \[\times\frac{dM_{12}^{2}}{(M_{12}^{2}-m_{\,W}^{2})^{2}+m_{\,W}^{2} \Gamma^{2}}\frac{dM_{34}^{2}}{(M_{34}^{2}-m_{\,W}^{2})^{2}+m_{\,W}^{2}\Gamma^{ 2}}d\Omega^{*}d\Omega_{12}\,d\Omega_{34} \tag{6}\]

This expression of the width is then easy to use in a Monte-Carlo, because the different terms are well separated.

It is used in PYTHIA 5.7 to treat both the \(H\to W^{+}W^{-}\) and \(H\to ZZ^{\star}\) decays. We will now derive the correct expression for the (\(ZZ^{\star}\)) process, that will be used in our Monte-Carlo.

#### 3.4.2 H\(\to\) ZZ\(\to l_{1}\overline{l}_{2}l_{3}\overline{l}_{4}\)

Compared to the WW case, we just have to introduce the following changes :

* \((1-\gamma^{5})\) becomes \(g_{v}-g_{a}\gamma^{5}\) ;
* \(g\) is now \(g_{Z}\) for \(H\to ZZ^{\star}\) vertex ;
* \(g\) is now \(\sqrt{2}g_{Z}\) for \(Z\to f\,\overline{f}\) vertex.

With these modifications, it is straightforward to obtain the matrix element :

\[\big{|}{\cal M}\big{|}^{2}=2g_{Z}^{6}m_{\,Z}^{2}\frac{(g_{v}^{4}+g_{a}^{4}+6g_ {v}^{2}g_{a}^{2})(p_{1}\cdot p_{3})(p_{2}\cdot p_{4})+(g_{v}^{2}-g_{a}^{2})^{2 }(p_{1}\cdot p_{4})(p_{2}\cdot p_{3})}{[(M_{12}^{2}-m_{Z}^{2})^{2}+m_{\,Z}^{2} \Gamma^{2}][(M_{34}^{2}-m_{\,Z}^{2})^{2}+m_{Z}^{2}\Gamma^{2}]}\quad, \tag{6}\]

giving the final expression for the width :

\[d\Gamma(ZZ\to 4\,f) = \frac{g_{Z}^{6}m_{\,Z}^{2}}{2^{16}\pi^{8}m_{\,H}^{2}}p^{\star} \tag{7}\] \[\times \big{[}(g_{v}^{4}+g_{a}^{4}+6g_{v}^{2}g_{a}^{2})(p_{1}\cdot p_{3 })(p_{2}\cdot p_{4})+(g_{v}^{2}-g_{a}^{2})^{2}(p_{1}\cdot p_{4})(p_{2}\cdot p_ {3})\big{]}\] \[\times \frac{dM_{12}^{2}}{(M_{12}^{2}-m_{\,Z}^{2})^{2}+m_{Z}^{2}\Gamma^ {2}}\frac{dM_{34}^{2}}{(M_{34}^{2}-m_{\,Z}^{2})^{2}+m_{Z}^{2}\Gamma^{2}}d \Omega^{\star}d\Omega_{12}d\Omega_{34}\quad.\]

The difference with (5) arises principally from the \((g_{v}-g_{a}\gamma^{5})\) term, which does not factorize as well as \((1-\gamma^{5})\) and introduce some crossed terms which will wash out the correlated angular distributions.

In the last part of this section, we are presenting the main distributions for the signal events computed with the correct and the \(H\to W^{+}W^{-}\) matrix element.

### Monte Carlo Generation

It has been explained that the phase space term for four particles can be expressed as :

\[d\Phi_{4}=\frac{p^{\star}d\Omega^{\star}dM_{12}^{2}d\Omega_{12}dM_{34}^{2}\, d\Omega_{34}}{2^{20}\pi^{\,12}m_{\,H}}\quad.\]

Where \(M_{12}\) and \(M_{34}\) refer respectively to the \(Z\to l_{1}l_{2}\) and \(Z^{\star}\to l_{3}l_{4}\) systems.

One can imagine to take \(M_{12}\), \(M_{34}\) and the three solid angles as parameters in our Monte-Carlo. As in the squared amplitude \([{\cal M}]^{2}\), there are some Breit and Wigner terms, it is wiser to use these distributions than to use some flat distributions.

The aim of our work is not to make a complete simulation of the Higgs decay process, but to look at the angular correlations which are expressed through some angles separation. Our Monte-Carlo is thus designed for this type of study, andwe didn't try to reproduce the initial Higgs momentum like in a proton-proton collision.. Technically this does not allow any event selection using \(p_{T}\) or \(\eta\) of outgoing leptons, but it is sufficient to generate the interesting distributions.

It will be possible to perform more complete studies when the new matrix element will be included in the PYTHIA program.

To compare to the PYTHIA default option we have generated a few samples with the \(H\to WW\) matrix element for both W and Z emission, and with the \(H^{0}\to ZZ^{\star}\) matrix element for Z emission. They are referenced as :

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|} \hline  & Pythia generator & MC WW matrix element & MC ZZ matrix element \\ \hline \(H\to W^{+}W^{-}\) & PY:WW & WW:WW & \\ \(H\to ZZ^{\star}\) & PY:ZZ & WW:ZZ & ZZ:ZZ \\ \hline \end{tabular}

Several Higgs masses have been tested (\(m_{\,H}=130\) GeV, \(m_{\,H}=200\) GeV, \(m_{\,H}=500\) GeV, \(m_{\,H}=1000\) GeV...)

They have been compared to a PYTHIA sample generated with \(m_{\,H}=130\) GeV, containing 5000 events, preselected with \(p_{T_{\,|proton}}>5\) GeV, and \(\eta<2.7\). This cut induces a small bias on the PYTHIA events compared to our Monte-Carlo events, but the effect on the correlation is very small compared to the matrix element one, and is not important for such a study.

### Physics results for ATLAS

As we explained in the introduction of this section, PYTHIA gives very correlated angles between leptons compared to the \(ZZ^{\star}\)background.

To see it we are looking at the following variables :* \(cos(\theta_{13})\). It is the cosine of the angle in the (HZZ) plane, between lepton 1 and 3.
* \(\phi_{13}\). The phi angle in the plane transverse to (HZZ), between leptons 1 and 3.
* \(cos(\theta_{1})\) and \(cos(\theta_{3})\) where \(\theta_{ij}\) is the angle between the lepton 1 or 3 and the Z or \(Z^{\star}\) direction in the Z or \(Z^{\star}\) center of mass.

The convention in the leptons numbering is the following : The lepton number "1"is the lepton with negative electric charge emitted by the Z. The lepton with negative charge arising from the second emitted Z is then the lepton "3".

The two other leptons, ie. positive leptons, would present some similar distributions.

On (fig 12), are presented the distribution of \(cos(\theta_{13})\) and \(\phi_{13}\) for the signal and the irreducible background, when using the PYTHIA generator.

We reproduce very well these distributions using in the sample (WW:ZZ) (fig 13). We can also verify this adequation when looking directly the \(cos(\theta_{1})\) and \(cos(\theta_{3})\) angles (fig 14).

These angles can be now compared to the results obtained with the sample generated with the correct \(H^{0}\to ZZ^{\star}\) matrix element.

On fig 15, 16 and 17 are presented the different angular distributions for the samples (WW:ZZ), (WW:WW) and (ZZ:ZZ)...

As expected, the angles distributions for the correct matrix element are now flat, and do not allow to differenciale the Higgs from the \(ZZ^{\star}\) background.

Indeed, as expected above, the \((g_{v}-g_{a}\gamma^{5})\) term, induces some crossed kinematic terms in the decay, which completely suppresses the correlation between the outgoing leptons.

In conclusion, for \(H^{0}\to ZZ^{\star}\), there is no hope to separate the higgs from the irreducible background by looking at the correlation.

The same study has been made for a higher Higgs mass (\(m_{H}=200\) GeV ), and leads to the same results.
