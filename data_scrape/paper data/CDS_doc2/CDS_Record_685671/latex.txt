**The ATLAS forward region is subject to many competing pressures and concerns, making its optimization a difficult exercise. We have proposed an alternative to the current baseline which relaxes many of the constraints and allows for a cleaner layout. It also provides a design philosophy which will guide more refined optimization with flexibility to address unforeseen problems. In this approach the forward calorimeter is integrated into the endcap calorimeter. This improves the \(E_{T}\) resolution, reduces backgrounds in the muon system, removes many conflicts between the calorimeter and muon coverage, decouples the detector from the accelerator, and allows more flexible installation and access. In response to this proposal the ATLAS Calorimetry Panel posed seven questions representing areas of concern. Here we enunciate each of these concerns and report our progress in addressing them.**

**Introduction**

The region of a hadron collider detector beyond \(|\eta|=3\), the forward region, is complex because of a number of competing requirements. The only detector in this region likely to survive at high luminosities is a calorimeter and, even then, the calorimeter must accommodate certain compromises in order to function adequately. It has been traditional to locate the forward calorimeter (FCal) as far from the interaction point (IP) as feasible in order to lower the deposited energy density as much as possible. But there are a number of practical considerations which create problems for this solution.

\(\bullet\) Particles and jets near transitions are poorly measured. In particular the \(E_{T}\) is poorly measured. Not only is the \(E_{T}\) resolution worse but the distribution has tails which can be a problem for some physics signatures. The magnitude of the problem depends on the details of the edge (in this case the inside edge of the endcap calorimeter) and the lever arm between the edge and the FCal. A large lever arm allows showers to spread and leads to poor measurements of \(E_{T}\). In the case of cryogenic calorimetry the inside edge of the endcap is not very clean due to the need for cryostat walls.

\(\bullet\) There is necessarily a lot of material in front of the FCal. The beampipe wall, the beampipe flanges, valves, pumps, etc. in addition to the cryostatwalls included above, present a surprising amount of material to particles above \(|\eta|=3\) headed towards the FCal. This material initiates EM or hadronic showers. Some of the energy is absorbed in this material, but worse is the spreading and redirection of this energy, exacerbated by the large lever arm. So again \(E_{T}\) is poorly measured.

\(\bullet\) The backgrounds in the muon system are large. The large distance between the endcap calorimeter and the FCal leaves open a region where backgrounds can enter the muon system. The backgrounds come from secondary interactions in the beampipe and beampipe elements, the endcap edge, the FCal, and the collimator for the low beta quads. While shielding helps, there is not a lot of room for much shielding. And the distributed sources make it difficult to develop optimal shielding strategies.

\(\bullet\) The muon coverage is compromised. It is difficult to extend the endcap EM calorimetry above about \(|\eta|=3.0\). Since the endcap already has marginal depth in \(\lambda\) it is difficult to extend the hadronic coverage beyond the edge of the EM coverage unless the absorber is changed from Cu (or Fe) to Tungsten or Uranium. Otherwise punchthrough into the first muon forward super layer will be unacceptable. The need for muon shielding which lies in the shadow of the endcap calorimeter pushes the \(|\eta|\) coverage of the muon system well below \(|\eta|=3.0\), to of order \(|\eta|=2.5\). The shielding occupies an \(\eta\) interval of order 0.2 to 0.3 and the forward toroid coils and cryostat occupy a similar \(\eta\) range.

\(\bullet\) At this moment the FCal must surround the collimator for the low beta quads. This is a space constraint which might be relaxed if the hall is made larger and the low beta quads can be retracted a bit. But at the present time it is an unpleasant situation which creates several problems. First, the performance of the FCal is degraded due to hadrons at \(|\eta|>5.0\) showering in the collimator and leaking into the FCal. Second, in order for accesses, the FCal must open or split in two and be removed via an elevator. And it is not clear how to support the collimator to the precision required within this splitting and elevating FCal.

\(\bullet\) Access is difficult. The tight space, the FCal location, and the shielding require an awkward disassembly and reassembly procedure for every access to the calorimeters and inner detector.

\(\bullet\) Optimization of one aspect of the forward region impacts the others, usually negatively. There is a lot of overlap and there isn't enough room. For instance 1) the present baseline design has a vacuum pump, valve, and flanges at about 8 m from the IP. This material significantly degrades the FCal performance. So the vacuum pump must be moved. But there is no obvious place to put it. The region is much too densely packed with other critical elements. But we need quality vacuum at the IP. 2) Space constraints would be relaxed a bit if the endcap calorimeter coverage extended further in \(|\eta|\) but the Spanish Fan concept will be strained, or the endcap depth (in \(\lambda\)) beyond \(|\eta|=3.0\) will be too thin, or yet another technology will be required. But then the transition moves to larger \(|\eta|\) and worsens the \(E_{T}\) measurement.

In order to address all of these problems at once, compromises are forced on the design which degrade the physics performance of ATLAS.

We presented an alternate concept for the ATLAS forward region in Reference 1 which is based on a simple strategy for dealing with the problems inherent in the baseline design. The most prominent difference between the baseline and the alternate concept is the placement of the FCal. Rather than moving the FCal as far from the IP as possible, the FCal is _integrated_ into the endcap calorimeter. So we called this the **integrated solution** to the problems of the ATLAS forward region.

The **integrated solution** has significant advantages compared to the baseline design. These include

\(\bullet\) The performance of the FCal in the integrated solution is enhanced. The energy and angle resolution are better, yielding an improved \(p_{T}\) resolution for particles and jets. This improved performance is important for a number of major physics signatures which could be seen at the LHC.

\(\bullet\) The backgrounds in the muon system (neutrons, photons, etc.) can be reduced by at least an order of magnitude. Fluxes in the central tracker and EM calorimeters are essentially the same as in the baseline. The activation of the FCal is the same as in the baseline but contained in a smaller volume, therefore easier to shield during accesses.

\(\bullet\) Constraints on the muon system coverage are relaxed. The forward muon superlayers and the endcap toroid can extend to higher values of \(|\eta|\). And there is more room for shielding, vacuum pumps, valves, flanges, etc.

\(\bullet\) The detector is decoupled from the accelerator. The forward calorimeter does not contain within it the collimator for the low beta quads.

\(\bullet\) Some installation and access issues are eased. There is no longer the need to open the FCal, exposing the highly activated low beta quad collimator during access. The muon shielding need not be moved in order to move the toroid and muon superlayers. The beampipe downstream of the endcap calorimeter need not have thin walls. Beampipe supports, flanges, and valves can be added as necessary without interference.

These features will make the ATLAS detector a superior instrument for probing new physics at the LHC.

The approach relies on an FCal technology which is inherently radiation hard and which can withstand the deposited energy density. At the January ATLAS Calorimetry Panel meeting we presented testbeam results from a liquid argon, forward calorimeter prototype module which is manifestly radiation hard and which can perform well in the high energy densities expected in the endcap region at large \(|\eta|\).

### Progress to Date

The ATLAS Calorimetry Panel drafted seven questions or areas of concern where further study was indicated. The questions fell into three categories: 1) Physics performance, 2) Radiation backgrounds, and 3) Practical design (including personnel access). Due to time pressures occasioned by the schedule for the Technical Proposal it was decided to require answers by the June 1st meeting of the Panel with possible iterations in time for the June 27th meeting. This is a rather short time for the extensive studies required to give adequate answers, especially considering that it is useful to provide some written material in advance of the meetings. So we have decided to provide a progress report because we have made substantial progress in some areas. In other areas we have no results yet although we are making good progress. For these areas we hope that preliminary oral presentation at the meeting will suffice for the short term and that written reports shortly thereafter will be acceptable.

### Physics Performance

Question 1: Demonstrate that the Integrated Forward Calorimeter has superior physics performance. We showed in Ref. [1] (with supporting documentation in Ref. [2] and [3]) that the integrated forward calorimeter gave better \(p_{T}\) resolution for pions and gammas (the components of jets) than for the baseline and for an intermediate solution with the endcap coverage extending to \(|\eta|=3.6\). While this difference was significant there was concern that these differences might wash out for a real physics process. We were encouraged to consider the study of heavy Higgs production via \(WW/ZZ\) fusion with jet-tagging in Ref. [4]. This we have done. The most likely value of \(|\eta|\) for a tagging-jet is very near the transition between the endcap and forward calorimeters. Intuition suggests that such a process would benefit from a nearly seamless transition as in the integrated solution rather than the ragged transition as in the baseline.

Because the time between the posing of this question and the time to report the answer was short we decided to focus rather narrowly. For the signal process of Higgs production through \(WW/ZZ\) fusion and decay via \(\overline{H}\to WW\to\ell\nu jj\) where one tagging-jet is detected there are several backgrounds. We chose to consider one of the important backgrounds to this process. These backgrounds determine the choice of optimal cuts on the candidate sample and therefore influence the event rate and discovery potential of ATLAS. We chose a pile-up background, i.e. the chance rate that a QCD multi-jet event would fall in the same crossing as another event with the signature of \(WW\to\ell\nu jj\) where one of the QCD jets would be mistaken for a tagging jet in the fusion process. This background was already estimated in Ref. [4] assuming preliminary estimates of the calorimetry performance. Below we describe another estimate where we use a fairly complete GEANT description of the calorimeter performance in the endcap/forward region for both the baseline and the integrated solutions.

After we presented our simulations of the performance of the ATLAS baseline to single photons and pions in the forward direction and the sources of the degradation of the baseline FCal performance were appreciated the next question was how to improve the baseline. Are the improvements relatively simple to effect or are they endemic? The problems with the performance in the baseline are dominated by practical considerations. The endcap cryostat walls, the beam pipe and its associated appurtenances, etc. are driven by real engineering needs and are not obvious until a real design is attempted with all the trade-offs accounted for. One could get a misleading result if the calorimeter cryostat walls were modified without regard to all the considerations which lead to its present design. We have therefore resisted making major changes to the baseline without the input of those who are responsible for the present design. In the relatively short time since we presented the single particle response results which showed the problems with the present design there has not been an opportunity to attempt a practical re-design of the ATLAS baseline forward region. But we would be happy to help with such a re-design and to simulate its response when time is available.

However we have, by fiat, removed the vacuum pump which appears in the baseline design and thinned the vacuum pipe. We don't know how adequate vacuum will be achieved but take it on faith that a way will be found. Adequate vacuum in the integrated solution is straightforward however.

The virtue of the integrated design is that it is much less dependent on engineering issues. The effect of the beampipe, cryostat walls, etc. on the performance is relatively small just because of the geometry. Several of the questions below relate to this and we address them in those sections.

So far we have set up a complete analysis chain where we generate Pythia events and run them through GEANT descriptions of the forward region options. After this we add 20 min bias events together, on top of a physics process, and analyze the event. We are now accumulating statistics.

**Effect on Endcap Calorimeter Performance**

**Question 2: How does the integrated FCal affect the performance of the endcap calorimeter? What is the increase in pileup in the endcap calorimeter due to showers initiated in the integrated forward calorimeter?**

This is a peculiar question. In the baseline design, for hadrons impinging on the endcap calorimeter at the high \(|\eta|\) edge more than half of their energy in the shower leaks out the side on average. That half leaks out is clear. But a normal shower has contributions on one side which originated on the other. By removing these contributions, as well as the other side of the shower, more than half is lost. Much of this energy is not recovered in a far forward calorimeter since it is spread out and confused with the overlapping min bias events. So the energy deposited in the endcap calorimeter in the baseline design is low because significant amounts of energy leak out at the high \(|\eta|\) transition.

When the forward calorimeter is adjacent to the endcap calorimeter then the calorimeter coverage is nearly seamless, giving improved performance. Part of this improved performance comes from the fact that the showers from hadrons hitting the high \(|\eta|\) edge of the endcap calorimeter do not leak out. This increases the energy deposited in this part of the endcap by more than a factor two. This is not a flaw, it is a virtue.

**However showers from hadrons which strike the low \(|\eta|\) edge of the integrated FCal leak into the endcap hadronic modules. This does degrade the performance of the endcap hadronic calorimeters while at the same time improving the global performance of ATLAS. In this section we calculate this leakage. But it is not entirely clear with what to compare it. In the integrated design we have placed the high \(|\eta|\) edge of the endcap calorimeter at \(|\eta|=3.0\). But this is not a practical boundary in the baseline. So for the baseline design which we simulated we have moved the high \(|\eta|\) edge of the endcap calorimeter to \(|\eta|=3.2\) in order to make room for a small amount of muon shielding without pushing the muon coverage too far from the desired goal. This means that the endcap calorimeter accepts hadrons at higher \(|\eta|\) in the baseline than in the integrated solution. So it is not possible to make as clean a comparison as one might like. But a clean comparison would be of academic interest only. The real situation is always more complicated and it is not possible to completely factor the competing pressures. This is an example.

This question is related to the question of the effect of the copper collimator embedded into the high pressure gas (HPG) FCal. In this case particles strike the collimator and their showers leak into the HPG FCal, degrading its performance. But there is a difference also. In this case the collimator is nota detector so there is no compensating virtue which it brings to the global reconstruction of events. There is no advantage to having the collimator inside the HPG FCal. If it can be removed further downstream there is no question that we should do so.

********

Address positive ion buildup problem as well. ****

It's interesting that the energy deposited in the last hadronic endcap wheel is less in the integrated solution than in the baseline. This arises because of the finite size of the interaction diamond at the IP. Min Bias events at the near end of the diamond give off particles which can strike the inner edges of the hadronic endcap modules. The presence of the FCal shields the inner edges of the endcap modules from this direct bombardment from interactions at the near end of the interaction diamond, thereby reducing the pileup in these modules. One could change the pointing in the endcap modules so that the edges projected to a point at the near end of the interaction diamond. But then this would produce a thin corner near the front of the endcap where particles from the far end of the interaction diamond would produce showers which would readily escape from the endcap and produce more spray further downstream. Extensive simulation is necessary before such a modification could be entertained.

****

**Question 3:** Consider a practical design for the integrated forward calorimeter. There will be some structural material and gap between the endcap hadronic modules and the forward calorimeter used for support, etc. What effect will such practical considerations have on the calorimeter performance? Also clarify the \(|\eta|\) coverage. The fiducial coverage in \(|\eta|\) should cover to 4.5 which means the physical coverage should extend to \(|\eta|=4.9\).

The simulations reported under question 1 above assume the physical coverage of the integrated FCal extends to \(|\eta|=4.9\). The reconstruction of events, including the pileup, does not require special treatment of the towers at the highest \(|\eta|\) so there is no loss of fiducial coverage beyond the conventional edge effects. However if physical coverage beyond \(|\eta|=4.9\) is required then there is room for this. The beam pipe in our present design is 120 mm in diameter. The inner detector working group has requested a beampipe about 50 mm in diameter. (It might go to a larger diameter when the LHC reaches full luminosity.) Hans Hoffmann has told us that a smaller diameter beampipe could easily be extended through the integrated FCal. It need not be as small as 50 mm. With a smaller beampipe the integrated FCal physical coverage could be extended if necessary.

Figure 3-1 shows the integrated FCal embedded in the TRIUMF/Washington design for the endcap hadronic modules, somewhat modified to accommodate the FCal. Figure 3-2 shows the same for the MPI design. Figure 3-3 is a close-up of a slice in the \(r-\phi\) plane at \(z=5000\) mm, i.e. in the middle of the EM FCal module. It shows the details of the endcap/FCal interface. The dead space between the endcap hadronic module and the EM FCal module, in \(r\), is about 7.5 mm plus a bit more where cable slots are located. This dead space is not much larger than that between tiles in the endcap hadronic module.

Our simulations assume a 5 mm dead space between the integrated FCal and the endcap hadronic modules. We assigned a 5 mm wide gap around the inner most endcap calorimeter tiles to a degradation in the endcap performance and left it out of our considerations. (We did the same for all configurations.) So our dead space includes an average of everything else. (It's 2.5 mm where there is no cable slot and 7.5 mm where there is a cable slot. Less than half the periphery is taken up by cable slots but then there are gaps where tube electrodes in the FCal do not quite fill out to the boundary so the average dead space is about what we quote.) The integrated FCal weighs about 16 tonnes while the endcap calorimeter weighs over 200 tonnes.

### Radiation Backgrounds

**Question 4:** Understand the origins of the radiation backgrounds. Agree (or understand the differences) with A. Ferrari. In particular understand better the albedo in the inner tracker.

We have made much progress on the question of radiation backgrounds. We had two half-day meetings with A.Ferrari during the past ATLAS Week. He then reported the results at both the muon working group meeting and the inner detector working group meeting. And Ferrari calculated the neutron fluence in the inner tracker for the integrated geometry and compared it with the baseline. This calculation appears as Figure 4-1. The work of Yu. Fisyak now appears as an ATLAS Note[5].

For our own calculations we have simulated five configurations.

1) The baseline design where the endcap calorimeter coverage extends to \(|\eta|=3.2\). This allows a reasonable amount of shielding and for muon coverage to extend to about \(|\eta|=2.6\). The muon coverage does not go as far as the muon working group would like. Note that we have removed the vacuum pump which was located at 8 m from the IP.

2) The extended baseline design is a modification which has been discussedas a means to solve a subset of the problems which we face. In this design everything is the same as in the baseline design except that the accordion endcap calorimeter covers to \(|\eta|=3.0\) instead of 3.2 and the hadronic endcap modules are extended out to \(|\eta|=3.5\). This allows more room for muon shielding and to extend the muon coverage out to \(|\eta|=2.8\).

3) The intermediate solution is similar in concept to the extended baseline but rather than extend the hadronic modules in \(|\eta|\) we have inserted a liquid argon tube electrode calorimeter with Tungsten absorber as in the integrated solution but with a much larger hole through the middle. We did this because we feared that the extended baseline design would present too few hadronic absorption lengths to particles in the range \(3.0<|\eta|<3.5\).

4) The integrated solution, as presented at the ATLAS Calorimetry Panel meeting of March 30, is described in Reference 1.

5) A small variant on the integrated solution which makes quick access particularly simple. (See section 5 below.) Here the muon shielding is a bit thinner than in the integrated solution.

In Table 4-1 we summarize some physical edges for each of the five configurations. In each column we list the high \(|\eta|\) edge for each relevant detector element. The physical coverage of the endcap calorimeter EM modules and hadronic modules are listed separately. The Near FCal is the LAr integrated forward calorimeter while the Far FCal is the High Pressure Gas (HPG) forward calorimeter. In the "Intermediate" configuration both types of FCal are present but the HPG FCal at 15 m from the IP is much smaller than in the baseline.

**Table 4-1: Maximum \(|\eta|\) Coverage**

\begin{tabular}{l c c c c c} Configuration & Muons & Endcap & \multicolumn{2}{c}{**FCal**} \\  & & EM & Hadron & Near & Far \\ Base (Baseline) & 2.6 & 3.2 & 3.2 & None & 5.0 \\ ExBa (Extended Base) & 2.8 & 3.0 & 3.5 & None & 5.0 \\ Itm (Intermediate) & 2.8 & 3.0 & 3.0 & 3.5 & 5.0 \\ IFC (Integrated) & 2.8 & 3.0 & 3.0 & 4.9 & None \\ IFCr (IFC Real) & 2.8 & 3.0 & 3.0 & 4.9 & None \\ \end{tabular}

Figures 4-2 through 4-7 show fluxes in the inner detector at specified locations. The fluxes are calculated for the baseline and for the integrated (IFCr) configurations. These plots allow accurate comparisons between these two options. Near the endcap calorimeter the neutron fluxes in the baseline rise above the fluxes in the integrated configuration because in the baseline the

endcap calorimeter covers to \(|\eta|=3.2\) while in the integrated configuration it covers only to \(|\eta|=3.0\). Other than this difference no trends can be seen. The fluxes appear to be the same to within the statistical accuracy of this study. Figure 4-8 is a contour plot of neutron fluxes in the inner detector region for kinetic energies above 100 keV. All of our plots assume a luminosity of 1.0\(\times 10^{34}\)cm\({}^{-2}\)s\({}^{-1}\). Assuming a year is \(10^{7}\) seconds one can compare this with Ferrari's Figure 4-1. Consider in particular our contour at \(10^{6}\) Hz/cm\({}^{2}\) which lies near \(z=3\) m, \(r=0.3\) m in Figure 4-8. Ferrari has a contour very close to this one (see Figure 4-1) labelled \(2.2\times 10^{13}\). Correcting for luminosity and for his units this contour would be relabelled \(1.3\times 10^{6}\) Hz/cm\({}^{2}\). This is within 30% of our value so the agreement looks very good.

Figures 4-9 through 4-16 show fluxes in the forward muon superlayers. Here the differences between configurations are striking. In each case the difference between the baseline and the integrated solutions is about an order of magnitude. The intermediate configuration generally shows about a factor 2 improvement over the baseline. Figures 4-15 and 4-16 suggest that the extended baseline configuration lies between the baseline and the intermediate configurations.

We have chosen 8 special regions in the detector (which do not change from one configuration to the next) where we keep track of the \(|\eta|\) of the generated particle at the IP which eventually leads to the background particles scored in the special region. We then produce plots of the background levels in that special region versus the \(|\eta|\) of the particle from the IP producing that background. An example is shown in Figure 4-17. The neutron and photon backgrounds in the first forward muon superlayer near the middle of the plane (350 cm \(<r<400\) cm) for the baseline and for the integrated solutions versus the \(|\eta|\) of the particle from the IP which produced that neutron or photon (usually through some long chain of reactions) are displayed side by side. Note that the vertical scales are not the same. In the baseline particles from the IP with \(|\eta|>3.2\) contribute to the neutron and photon backgrounds in this special region (and in many other regions in the muon system). The very few contributions from below \(|\eta|=3.2\) probably come from interactions in the beampipe upstream of the endcap calorimeter which produce secondaries which exit the inner detector region through the \(|\eta|>3.2\) hole in the endcap calorimeter. Particles with \(|\eta|>7.7\) continue through the collimator for the low beta quads without interaction and so do not contribute to the backgrounds in the collision hall. Particles with \(6.2<|\eta|<7.7\) strike that collimator (and the small inverse cone section of beampipe just upstream of it). Particles with \(5.0<|\eta|<6.2\) strike that collimator also but not before passing through the cylindrical beam pipe, vacuum pump, flange, and valve just upstream of it. Particles with \(3.2<|\eta|<5.0\) strike the endcap cryostat walls (not a big contribution), the beam pipe (and its appurtenances) and the forward calorimeter or low beta quad collimator. For the integratedsolution only particles from the IP with \(|\eta|>4.9\) contribute. This shows the virtues of hermetic calorimetry. Most of the backgrounds appear to come from spray from the cryostat walls and beam pipe in the region of the endcap calorimeter. The low beta quad collimator is much better shielded in the integrated solution so very little background comes from this source (\(|\eta|\mathrel{\hbox to 0.0pt{\raise 2.1973pt\hbox{$>$}}{\lower 2.1973pt\hbox{$ \sim$}}}5.5\)). We learn from such studies that the sources of backgrounds in the muon system are distributed in the baseline design, i.e. they come from a number of sources. In contrast the integrated solution has one source, the \(|\eta|=5.0\) edge. It is likely that further iterations of the integrated solution will realize further improvements in the backgrounds in the muon system. Such improvements will be harder to come by in the baseline. A full set of these studies is contained in a separate document\({}^{12}\).

**Access**

**Question 5: In the integrated solution how does one access the inner detector and the calorimeter electronics?**

For this discussion we drafted a brief statement with the help of Hans Hoffmann and Daniel Fournier on the assumptions and scenarios for access to the ATLAS detector. This subject is evolving at the moment and so the statement is subject to change. It will likely be out-of-date very soon. Nevertheless it is a starting point from which further iterations may follow. We use it to set the stage for dealing with questions in this section and the next.

Assumptions:

Machine performance

1st year \(\int\hat{\mathcal{L}}dt=3\times 10^{39}\) cm\({}^{-2}\)

2nd year \(\int\hat{\mathcal{L}}dt=3\times 10^{40}\) cm\({}^{-2}\)

3rd year \(\int\hat{\mathcal{L}}dt=1\times 10^{41}\) cm\({}^{-2}\)

All subsequent years same as 3rd year

Calorimeter performance

15% probability that one of three cryostats will have to

be opened after initial cooldown. This will be known within

the first year. After that there is a much lower probability

that one of the cryostats will be opened. This is based on

experience with other large liquid argon calorimeter systems

such as H1, SLD, D0,... The endcaps might need to be

rejuvenated after 6 years or so of accumulated irradiation.

After this length of running time we might want to upgrade

the calorimeter system anyway so much of it might be replaced.

Access Scenarios

Planned Accesses

Quick Access

Approximately 1 per month. Move one endcap calorimeter

by 2 m. Access to electronics wheel and/or end of tracker

Medium Access

Approximately 2 per year. Move one endcap calorimeter

by 4 m. Extract tracker by 2.5 m. Access to inner parts

of tracker.

Major Access

Approximately 1 per year during major LHC shutdown.

Remove tracker from the hall.

Catastrophic Accesses

Major Access to inside of Liquid Argon Barrel Calorimeter

Open barrel cryostat for repairs. Repairs performed

in situ if possible. Probability of order 5% in first

year of running. Probability drops after the first year.

Major Access to inside of Liquid Argon Endcap Calorimeter

Open endcap cryostat for repairs. Endcap may be removed

from the hall for these repairs. Probability of order

5% for each endcap in first year of running. Probability

drops after the first year. But then with irradiation

the probability might increase after 5 years or so. It's

not clear whether we'd call this a repair or an upgrade.

In some sense the _quick access_ is the most challenging since the time allowed for the access is so short. We have developed a simple scheme for the integrated solution which appears to meet the time requirements. Figure 5-1 shows the detector as it is configured during a running period. Figure 5-2 shows the weights of the various shielding pieces. It is significant that most of the heavy shielding pieces need not be moved during this type of access. The first step in the _quick access_ is indicated in Figure 5-3. The forward toroid has been retracted by 2.5 meters. And a support has been placed under the muon shielding. Note that the muon shielding is shaped in such a way to allow the toroid to be retracted without moving any of the heavy shielding. The short 20 tonne piece of muon shielding (refer to Figure 5-2) has been removed in Figure 5-4 as well as the 1.5 tonne scraper just downstream of the endcap calorimeter. The 20 tonne muon shielding piece (and the 1.5 tonne scraper) separates into parts so that it can be removed without removing the beampipe. And since the parts are lighter than the whole it allows for easier removal. Next the Fe shielding wall downstream of the endcap calorimeter is rolled back to allow access to the endcap calorimeter electronics. In practice this 124 tonne piece of Fe might be made of smaller pieces which can be individually removed to allow selected access to the endcap electronics. Figure 5-5 shows the final step in the _quick access_ scenario. The endcap calorimeter is retracted by 2 m to allow access to the barrel calorimeter electronics and/or to the end of the tracker. This scheme also has the advantage that there is no problem is supporting the beam pipe during the various movements. Were the heavy shielding to be moved with the toroid, then a way to temporarily support the beam pipe would have to be found.

## Activation

Question 6: In the integrated solution the forward calorimeter is quite close to the interaction point and therefore will become highly activated. Since it is near where personnel must frequent during accesses what levels of dose will personnel be exposed to under different access scenarios? Also how much \({}^{41}\)Ar will there be in addition to that already produced in the endcap.

**dose contours starting from star densities provided by Yuri Fisyak (and our own calculations) and using the methods of Graham Stevenson and others[8, 9] to determine activation and surface dose. The second approach allows one to make simple estimates of the effects of changes in geometry without the overhead of the rather lengthy, full calculation. We found reasonable agreement between the two approaches. Here we present results only from the first approach[6].**

**Dose in mrem/hr at various locations near the activated, integrated FCal after the second 30 day exposure to minimum bias events at \(10^{34}\)cm\({}^{-2}\)s\({}^{-1}\) and after one day of cooldown. There is no other material to shield the FCal.**

**The average luminosity was assumed to be \(10^{34}\)cm\({}^{-2}\)s\({}^{-1}\). A run cycle was assumed to be 30 days of beam followed by 10 days of shutdown. Four cycles constitute a year of running. From the data in the tables and Figure 6-3 one can see that the activation nearly saturates after 30 days so the activation does not depend sensitively on the length of a beam-on cycle aslong as it is tens of days long. In order to isolate the effect of the integrated FCal from other activated sources in ATLAS we ran DTUJET events only into the integrated FCal. We then calculated the dose contours with and without other material in the vicinity. This "other material" included an approximation to the endcap calorimeter. To make the geometry reasonably simple we simulated only a homogenized (see Ref. 4) EM endcap accordion calorimeter and the copper shield at the back end of the endcap cryostat which is 20 cm thick. See Figure 6-1. Due to a miscommunication the part of this shield below a radius of 75 cm was left out. If one were to include this the dose at large z will be further reduced. Since this dose is already small we did not attempt to correct this error.

**We were not concerned with doses on the outer periphery of the endcap calorimeter so we did not include any of the hadronic endcap modules. Wealso assume that Pb personnel shields might be located in critical areas during accesses. It is intended that these be hung from the cryostat face. It is clear from the figures that we have not chosen optimized shielding configurations. The Pb personnel shields could be much smaller in radius and in thickness for instance. Table 6-9 shows the average energy of decay photons from each of the activated elements. These energies are lower than assumed when the personnel shielding thicknesses were chosen and so the shielding is far more effective than planned. We planned for 5 attenuation lengths but got about 28 instead. Figure 6-4 shows the complete decay photon spectra. The high energy part of the spectrum will not be effectively filtered by a thin personnel shield so some optimization can be done with the information given here.

background dose comes from alphas from radon and radon daughters of order 0.020 mrem/hr. On airplanes the dose measured by a Geiger counter rises to about 0.4 mrem/hr at 11,000 meters. The dose due to neutrons probably doubles or trebles that[10]. Calculations for the ATLAS LOI show the contact dose for the front face of the endcap calorimeter to be in the range of 50 to 200 mrem/hr for a 30 day run at \(10^{34}\)cm\({}^{-2}\)s\({}^{-1}\) and one day of cooldown. Since this is an extended source the dose will not fall off very rapidly with distances of order 1 meter.

The access scenarios discussed under question 5 suggest that we have calculated a worst case which might arise after the third year of running. In the first few years the integrated luminosity will be well below what we have assumed and the doses will scale down by the same factor. It is during the first year or two that we expect to make the most accesses. After that we hope that operation will be smoother and that fewer accesses will be required.

Dose in mrem/hr at various locations near the activated, integrated FCal after the second 30 day exposure to minimum bias events at \(10^{34}\)cm\({}^{-2}\)s\({}^{-1}\). The EM accordion endcap calorimeter, the 20 cm thick Copper shield plate at the end of the endcap cryostat, and two 5 cm thick Pb personnel shields are in place.

**It may happen that we must access the insides of the endcap calorimeter in order to fix some failure. This would be scheduled during a major access and the time between shutdown and the time when we can remove the forward calorimeter from the cryostat is expected to be tens of days. Let us assume that some part of the hadronic endcap calorimeter must be repaired. As an approximation we can assume that the surface dose at the inner radius of the hadronic endcap is the same as the surface dose at the outer radius of the integrated forward calorimeter. These doses appear as the last entry in Tables 6-1 to 6-7. However all these doses are quoted for times immediately after shutdown or 1 day after shutdown.**

**Figure 6-3 indicates the time dependence of the dose with the length of the cooldown. If the endcap calorimeter is to be removed from the collision hall before it is opened and the individual modules accessed, then the cooldowntime is likely to be longer than 20 days before personnel are exposed to the innards of the calorimeter. During such a delay the dose should drop about a factor 20 from the dose at the end of the 30 day run in the EM module. So the surface dose on the outer periphery of the EM module (the hottest module) should drop to about 6 mrem/hr. The dose should drop by about a factor 4 due to the hadronic modules but continues to drop reasonably quickly after that.

 \end{tabular} Summary of total doses in mrem/hr at various locations near the activated, integrated FCal under the conditions of tables 6-1 to 6-6. Columns 1, 3, and 5 are after the second 30 day exposure to minimum bias events at \(10^{34}\)cm\({}^{-2}\)s\({}^{-1}\) while columns 2, 4, and 6 are after a one day cooldown period. Columns 1 and 2 correspond to the case where the integrated FCal is completely unshielded. Columns 3 and 4 correspond to the case where the integrated FCal is shielded by the endcap EM accordion module and the copper shield. Columns 5 and 6 correspond to the case where the integrated FCal is shielded by the endcap EM accordion, the copper shield, and two 5 cm thick Pb personnel shields.

We do not expect to pull apart the forward calorimeter modules. The construction is so simple that failures requiring disassembly are unlikely. However if there is some failure then it is likely fixed by pulling a rod from the front or rear surface and replacing it. This is a straight-forward operation requiring little time and therefore little exposure.

After five or more years of operation there may be an increase in the probability that access into the endcap cryostat is necessary. This may be driven by failures due to radiation exposure. However after this length of time the collaboration will also be thinking about upgrades to the detector subsystems. So it is not clear whether we are talking about repairs or replacements. Replacements will require far less exposure to activated parts than repairs.

Disposal of the activated forward calorimeter at the end of its useful life is a problem that will be faced by all forward calorimeters. The magnitude of the problem depends more on the number of activated nuclides rather than their density. This number is independent of the location of the forward calorimeter. And the problem is small compared to the disposal of the collimators protecting the low beta quads.

Production of \({}^{41}\)Ar can be a problem if there is a cryogenic leak followed by rapid evaporation into the atmosphere. The worst-case scenario would be if the leak occurred during a high luminosity run. Then radioactivity would be released into the atmosphere.

Simple calculations show that about 8 times as much energy is deposited in the integrated FCal as in the endcap from minimum bias events. On the other hand the sampling fraction in the endcap hadronic modules is about 8 times larger than in the integrated FCal. So roughly equal amounts of \({}^{41}\)Ar will be produced in each, i.e. the amount of \({}^{41}\)Ar produced will double if the integrated solution is adopted. The half-life of \({}^{41}\)Ar is 1.8 hours. Laurie Waters calculates that 0.09 Curies of \({}^{41}\)Ar will build up in each integrated FCal after a run at \(\pounds=10^{34}\)cm\({}^{-2}\)s\({}^{-1}\). (The length of the run is immaterial as long as it is long compared to the half-life.) With 13.3 half-lives per day it decays by four orders of magnitude to 8.7 \(\mu\)Ci or \(3.2\times 10^{5}\) Bq at one day after the end of a run.

Average energy, in MeV, of the decay gamma spectrum. The first line is at the end of the second 30 day run at \(10^{34}\)cm\({}^{-2}\)s\({}^{-1}\) while the second line is one day of cooldown after that.

In conclusion, the doses received by personnel during accesses to the central tracker and/or the calorimeter electronics due to the integrated FCal appear to be much smaller than the doses received from other sources. The length of the access will not be limited by activation of the integrated FCal. The doses received, if a part of the endcap calorimeter must be repaired, appear to be reasonably small. Even the integrated forward calorimeter can be repaired with due care. The \({}^{41}\)Ar production is about the same as in the endcap and decays away to negligible levels in one day.

**Cost Estimate**

**Question 7: Please provide a cost estimate using as guidance the cost estimates for the other forward calorimeter technologies detailed in a draft ATLAS Calorimetry Panel report.**

**Here we present a cost estimate based on world market prices but not including categories, such as EDIA, R&D, contingency, etc. which do not traditionally appear in CERN accounting schemes. We expect this price would pertain without regard to who builds the integrated FCal. We note that some other scheme has been used to cost the High Pressure Gas forward calorimeter. For instance the cost of the iron is not included since, it is argued, it already exists. Also some of the electronics costs do not correspond to costs for these items in Europe or the US.**

Figure 4-17. Neutron and photon flux in the baseline and integrated configurations as a function of the \(|\eta|\) of the particle from the IP producing the background. These plots correspond to a small region in the first forward muon superlayer with 350 cm \(<r<\) 400 cm. Note that the vertical scales are different in the baseline and integrated plots. The areas under the curves should correspond to the levels read from the plots in Figures 4-9 and 4-11.

retracted by 2.5 m. A support at the front end of the 172 tonne muon shielding cone has been installed.

Figure 5-4. The ATLAS integrated solution with the 20 tonne muon shielding piece and the 1.5 tonne scraper removed. The 124 tonne Fe shielding wall has been retracted by 2 m. Complete access to the endcap calorimeter electronics is now possible.

Figure 6-1. The integrated forward calorimeter as simulated in the Los Alamos activation calculations. Also shown are those parts of the endcap calorimeter used in the shielding studies and the Pb personnel shielding. The small squares indicate positions where doses are quoted in Tables 6-1 through 6-7.

Figure 6-2. Dose contours in rem/hr after a 30 day run at \(10^{34}\)cm\({}^{-2}\)s\({}^{-1}\) and a one day cooldown. The approximation to the endcap calorimeter acting as a shield and the Pb personnel shields are in place. This corresponds to the last column in Table 6-7. The darkest shade corresponds to doses above 300 mrem/hr. The next darkest corresponds to doses above 2.3 mrem/hr. And the next after that corresponds to doses above 20 \(\mu\)rad/hr.

Figure 6-3. Activation of the integrated FCal modules versus time. The four 30-day beam-on cycles are apparent. Each is separated by 10 days off. After 4 cycles there is a long shut-down for the rest of the year. The tables 6-1 to 6-7 correspond to the dose at the end of the 2nd cycle and then one day after the end of the 2nd cycle. This plot shows how the dose behaves at other times. The data was calculated only at discrete times and straight lines connect these data points. During beam-on data points are taken at 10 minutes, 1 hour, 1 day, and 30 days. This explains why the beam-on cycles appear to be linear ramps. They actually saturate quickly as can easily be seen by the short rise. During cooldown data is taken at 1 day, 3 days, and 10 days. At the end of the 4th cycle there are two additional data points at 60 days and 1 year.
