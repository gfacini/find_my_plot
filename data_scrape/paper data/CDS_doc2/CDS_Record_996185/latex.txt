# Module-to-module uniformity at 180 GeV in 2002-2003 TileCal calibration testbeams

Martina Hurwitz

###### Abstract

The response of several Tile Calorimeter production modules to a 180 GeV hadron testbeam was studied. The uniformity in the mean response was calculated for several \(\eta\) values. Averaged over \(\eta\), the uniformity of the mean response was found to be \(1.37\pm 0.15\%\).

## 1 Introduction

Several Tile Calorimeter production modules were exposed to hadron testbeams in the years 2002 and 2003. The typical TileCal configuration in the testbeam is shown in Figure 1. Module 0, one barrel production module, and two extended barrel production modules were placed on a movable table. In 2002 and 2003 there were six different run periods, during which six different sets of production modules were tested. In August 2003 a slightly different configuration was used, with a second barrel production model replacing the two extended barrel modules. All of the runs studied in this note were taken in a projective geometry, with the beam impinging on the production barrel module. The \(\eta\) range studied in the testbeam was \(-0.85<\eta<0.45\).

The modules were exposed to several different beam particles at several different energies. During five of the six run periods mentioned above, the central barrel module was exposed to a 180 GeV beam of positive polarity composed primarily of hadrons and electrons with some muon contamination. The hadrons in the beam were pions and protons.

## 2 Energy reconstruction

The beam was cleaned of multi-particle and off-axis events using scintillators and beam chambers upstream of the calorimeter. Upper thresholds were placed on energy deposited in each of three upstream scintillators. Particles were required to be within a certain rectangle in both of the beam chambers, as well as to be traveling within a certain angle relative to the beam axis. The exact cuts changed from testbeam period to testbeam period because the properties of the beam and the beam detectors changed.

Muon contamination was removed from the beam by requiring the energy deposited in the calorimeter to be greater than 5.0 GeV. To remove electrons the variables \(C_{\rm long}\) and \(C_{\rm tot}\), which characterize the size of the shower in the calorimeter, are used. They are described in detail in Reference [1]. A correlation plot for these two variables is shown in Figure 2. The points above the line are electrons and those below the line are hadrons. There was no cut made to separate pions from protons. At 180 GeV, about 76% of the hadrons in the beam were protons [1].

The energy deposited in the calorimeter was determined by adding the energy in cells in a 0.3\(\times\)0.3 region in \(\Delta\eta\times\Delta\phi\) around the beam axis. The 0.3 region in \(\eta\) in the extended barrel modules was approximated, since the towers of the extended barrel do not match the towers of the barrel.

In each testbeam period there were some bad components: dead or misbehaving channels or drawers. Bad components were determined using calibration runs. A summary of bad components is given in Table 1. If there were bad channels, the response in the other readout channel of the same cell was doubled. If a whole module was bad, all runs using this module were left out of the analysis.

Table 1: List of bad components for testbeam periods considered. In the notation used for the modules, the N or P signifies the negative or positive side of the module, while the 0, 1, and 2 refer to Module 0, the barrel module, and the extended barrel modules respectively. For example, N1 is the \(\eta<0\) side of the barrel module. Channel refers to PMT number, counting from 1.

Figure 2: Correlation of \(C_{\rm long}\) and \(C_{\rm tot}\). These variables characterize the shape of the shower in TileCal, so they can be used to separate hadrons from electrons. In this run, points above the line are considered electrons, points below the line hadrons.

The reconstructed energy in TileCal is shown in Figure 3 for a run at \(\eta=-0.45\) taken in August 2003. The shape was fit with a Gaussian in a range of \(\mu\pm 2\sigma\).

The TileCal channels were intercalibrated using the Cesium and charge injection calibration systems. An absolute calibration to the electromagnetic scale was determined by measuring the calorimeter's response to electrons. A separate calibration factor (usually referred to as the pC/GeV factor) was derived for each module. Since only a limited number of modules were exposed to the electron testbeam, it is desirable to use an average of all of the calibration factors rather than separate factors for each module. For the uniformity study in section 3, one overall factor was applied to all modules. For comparison, in section 4 the same study is performed with each module calibrated to the electromagnetic scale separately.

## 3 Module-to-module uniformity of response

The mean response of the calorimeter was compared for several different testbeam periods (i.e. for several different production modules). The response was compared for runs taken at the same \(\eta\) value, and positive and negative sides of the same barrel module were considered separate since they are instrumented separately.

The distribution of mean responses at \(|\eta|=0.35\) for nine different modules is shown in Figure 4. The RMS/mean for this distribution is \(1.48\pm 0.36\%\), and no modules fall outside the limits of the plot. The error of the RMS/mean was calculated using a toy Monte Carlo, which found the error associated with taking the RMS of the measured number of points generated from a Gaussian distribution. Due to the low number of measured points, the error on the RMS/mean is large.

The mean and RMS of the mean response were similarly calculated at each \(|\eta|\) value. The number of different modules compared varied between four and nine. At \(|\eta|=0.05\), the response on the positive and negative sides of the setup are correlated, since the \(0.3\times 0.3\) regions overlap, so only the \(\eta<0\) side was used. At \(|\eta|<0.2\), data from August 2003 were excluded because of the slightly different setup used in that testbeam period1.

Footnote 1: As mentioned in Section 1, a barrel module replaced the two extended barrel modules, resulting in less leakage at low \(|\eta|\).

Figure 5 shows the mean and RMS/mean as a function of \(|\eta|\). The mean response is lower at low \(|\eta|\) because of leakage out of the top of the barrel module (there is a gap between the two extended barrel modules as shown in Figure 1) and out of the

back. The average RMS/mean is \(1.37\pm 0.15\%\) and shows no significant evidence of variation with \(|\eta|\). The confidence level for the hypothesis of a flat distribution is \(90\%\).

## 4 Calibration to the electromagnetic scale

The uniformity study of the previous section was repeated, this time applying separate calibration factors to each module. A summary of the calibration factors used is given in Table 2. The barrel module calibration factors were derived from electron testbeams. For the extended barrel modules and Module 0, a constant calibration factor was applied.

The results of the uniformity study are shown in Figure 6. The RMS/mean as a function of \(|\eta|\) is shown using both methods: one overall calibration factor or separate factors for each module. The average RMS/mean using a single calibration factor is \(1.37\pm 0.15\%\). When using several calibration factors, the RMS/mean is \(1.15\pm 0.12\%\). The difference between the two methods is \(0.22\pm 0.19\%\).

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|c|} \hline Period & Module & Calibration constant \\ \hline August 2003 & Barrel + & 1.048 \\ \hline August 2003 & Barrel - & 1.023 \\ \hline July 2003 & Barrel + & 1.028 \\ \hline July 2003 & Barrel + & 1.033 \\ \hline June 2003 & Barrel + & 1.028 \\ \hline June 2003 & Barrel - & 1.019 \\ \hline August 2002 & Barrel + & 1.055 \\ \hline August 2002 & Barrel - & 1.056 \\ \hline July 2002 & Barrel + & 1.043 \\ \hline July 2002 & Barrel - & 1.051 \\ \hline All & Extended barrel and & 1.040 \\  & Module 0 & \\ \hline \end{tabular}

## 5 Conclusions

The response of several barrel modules to 180 GeV hadrons was compared. The response was found to be uniform across different modules at constant \(\eta\) at the \(1.37\pm 0.15\%\) level. There was no evidence for variation in uniformity of the response with \(\eta\). Use of different calibration constants for each module was found not to affect the uniformity of the response in a significant way.
