**Building Blocks of the Universe**

**using stackable plastic bricks to impart knowledge in particle physics**

The ATLAS Collaboration

This article presents possibilities to impart knowledge of and enthusiasm for particle physics to essentially all non-expert target audiences by the use of LEGO bricks and models of particle physics experiments built from these. Methods of using LEGO models, both as a passive exhibit and as part of interactive outreach events, are presented, along with a historical review of the "Build Your Own Particle Detector" programme and the corresponding idea of hosting competitions in building detector models in LEGO pieces as a perfect setting to grasp people's attention, get them involved and ultimately convey knowledge in particle physics to them.

## 1 Introduction

Finding the ultimate "Building Blocks of the Universe" as well as understanding their interactions and thereby solving some of the greatest mysteries mankind still has to answer. That is just one way of summarising the objectives of elementary particle physics in one sentence. One might already guess that this endeavour is not an easy one and that it is fundamental research we are talking about. The kind of research where results won't have a direct implication on your every-day life in the next few years, but also research that has driven mankind forward over centuries. It is the answers to such very basic questions that brought us to where we are today. It is research carried out by only a few people, but yet interesting and inspiring for so many others. Usually people not directly involved in this hunt for answers simply do not know enough about it, but get fascinated and excited once they do.

This article is devoted to just one idea of how to grasp people's attention and get them involved to share some of the enthusiasm for elementary particle physics and all the questions we can already answer and mysteries we yet have to solve.

As the whole project started out with the design and construction of a LEGO [1] model of the ATLAS [2] detector, the first section is dedicated to the initial idea, a short historical overview and some details and suggestions for the use of the model during outreach activities within the ATLAS Collaboration. The second section introduces the "Build Your Own Particle Detector" [3] (BYOPD) idea as a second stage to get people interested and involved. It also highlights the by now broad selection of LEGO models of other particle physics experiments as well as ways of using social media to further increase the reach of the BYOPD idea.

## 2 The ATLAS LEGO Model

In the same way people are fascinated by the physics and mysteries yet to solve once they have heard about it, they are usually also stunned by current particle physics experiments once they have seen them. Unfortunately not everyone has the chance to visit one of the big laboratories such as CERN [4], the European Organisation for Nuclear Research in Geneva, to actually see one of today's enormous experiments; such as ALICE [5], ATLAS, CMS [6] or LHCb [7]; for real. To still enable people to getan idea of the sheer size, complexity and the structure of these experiments scale models offer a unique possibility. If in addition, these models are built using simple off-the-shelf building blocks appealing to everyone who has been and/or still is a child one ends up with an ideal exhibit to explain the experimental means to answer fundamental question in particle physics. As a result of that, building a LEGO model of the ATLAS experiment is an almost obvious way to go.

### An Odyssey

The idea of building an ATLAS LEGO model was born already in 2006, in preparation for a public outreach event at the Niels Bohr Institute [8] (NBI) in Copenhagen. It took about five years until in autumn 2011 a more or less complete 3D draft for an ATLAS LEGO model was ready. The actual design, done using the LEGO Digital Designer software [9], took about 48 hours, almost entirely spent on a single weekend with very little sleep. The model consists of about 9500 pieces, of 201 different types, in eleven different colours. Once built about it is 1 m \(\times\) 50 cm \(\times\) 50 cm in size and roughly 1:50 in scale and approximately matches a standard LEGO mini figure.

It took little to no convincing for the high energy physics group at NBI to cover the expenses for the first real life model. At that time an order was as simple as pressing a button within the software. After about 33 hours of work, spread out over several weekends and after hours in the electronics lab at NBI, the very first ATLAS LEGO model, as shown in Figure 1, was built.

A few days before the first model was completely constructed, and unfortunately a bit too early to be fully prepared, the first pictures went public and the model caught quite some attention through several science related blogs. Once the model was finished and after an overwhelming response in blogs, newspapers and magazines from around the world, it did not take much to convince the ATLAS Outreach group to finance two more models, one to be displayed in the ATLAS Visitor Centre at CERN and one to create building instructions for more models to come. As the Digital Designer could not provide a sensible construction manual with a reasonable number of pages, it was decided to create a manual in the form of video clips instead. With the kind help and support of the public relations office at NBI a set of 20 video clips, showing the construction of the second ATLAS LEGO model and still available at [3], was produced over a period of about three months, using professional recording and mixing equipment. Unfortunately, due to the discontinuation of LEGO's "Design by Me" programme in January 2012, these three models were the only ones that could easily be bought from within the Digital Designer software. As the online LEGO store turned out to be unsuitable for ordering this amount and variety of bricks and pieces, another solution had to be found, marking the beginning of an odyssey.

the period of about half a year, contact was finally, and to a large extent by sheer luck, made to someone within the LEGO Community Building Programme. As word about the model spread within the ATLAS Collaboration there was already quite some demand for ATLAS LEGO models from ATLAS institutes from all around the world. With the kind help of the guys at the LEGO Community Building Programme, the first order of seven models was placed in May 2012, and sets of pieces were sent directly to institutes in Canada, Switzerland, Italy and the UK. Soon after the first of these models was constructed and due to an increased interest by the member institutes, another order was placed in September 2012. Out of the 27 models in this order 16 went to Japan, giving full coverage of all Japanese ATLAS institutes at the time.

In parallel to the continued success of the large model, a smaller version, made of _only_ 560 pieces, roughly 1:2000 in scale and shown in Figure 2, was born in late 2012. The idea was to turn it into a more or less official set and make it available to the public as a souvenir in CERN and ATLAS shops and to use it during outreach activities. While trying to accomplish this idea, once again talking to various people, the support of the LEGO Community Building Programme for the large ATLAS LEGO model unfortunately stopped in March 2013. As kind of a counter-reaction to that and as it seemed to be the only way to turn the smaller model into an official set, the smaller model entered the LEGO Ideas1 campaign in June 2013 [10]. With the help of various blogs, news sites, newspapers and especially IFLS [11], the campaign reached the necessary 10k supporters in record-breaking time and the ATLAS mini model entered the official review in September 2013.

Footnote 1: At the time, LEGO Ideas was still known as LEGO Cuusoo.

At the same time, other means of creating wide-spread attention to restart the support for the large ATLAS LEGO model were considered. And so it was in October 2013 and with the help of the high energy physics group at Manchester University, that 2013 Nobel laureate Professor Peter Higgs could be convinced to sign one of the many ATLAS LEGO models, as shown in Figure 3. Apparently, this caused enough attention, so that within only a few days another, this time ultimately final, order of 23 large ATLAS LEGO models could be placed.

In January 2014, the LEGO Review Board decided not to turn the ATLAS mini model into an official set, most likely due to the imperfect design, which admittedly was rather a placeholder for an idea than a proper and well thought through LEGO design.

In February 2014, 350 kg of LEGO pieces, from the latest and last order, arrived at CERN and in a tremendous five-day effort these were sorted into 23 sets of pieces, to be shipped out to ATLAS institutes around the world. Just at the end of this little endeavour and kind of the icing on the cake, 2013 Nobel

lureate Professor Francois Englert could be convinced to par with Peter Higgs and sign another part of a large ATLAS LEGO model, as shown in Figure 3.

By the time of writing this article, there exist at least 60 large ATLAS LEGO models at 57 institutes in 16 countries on five different continents. At least two more individuals have ordered the pieces by other means and built the large model using their own brick collection. There are many more than 100 copies of the ATLAS mini model worldwide. The two Nobel laureates' signatures can be seen in the ATLAS LEGO model showcase in the ATLAS Visitor Centre at Point 1 at CERN.

### Using the Model for Outreach

The ATLAS LEGO model turned out to be huge success and has been used for a variety of outreach activities over recent years. From being a sole, though very eye-catching, display item in exhibitions and during public events of the ATLAS institutes and museums world wide, to being used to actively teach particle physics to students.

Being built from LEGO pieces makes the model an eye-catcher giving the chance to talk to people that otherwise would not have visited the particle physics event or exhibition otherwise. Talking to visitors looking at the model is an ideal setting to get them involved in a discussion about the experiment and the physics goals. The fact that the model is roughly in scale to the LEGO mini figures that come along with it and features all essential parts of the experiment, adds additional value to the discussions, as people can get an idea of the size and the structure of a modern general purpose particle physics experiment. In addition to the ideal case, of having physicists able to explain things available during outreach event, the model has also been featured as a central item in various long-term exhibitions at institutes and museums, such as Deutsches Museum Bonn [12], Melbourne Planetarium [13] and Palais de la Decouverte Paris [14], just to name a few.

Aside from being a static exhibit, the ATLAS LEGO model has also been used during interactive events. Embedded in presentations and discussions about particle physics, groups of eight to twelve students have built the model together with ATLAS members over the course of one or two days. The time spent on building the various parts of the ATLAS detector can be used to discuss the relevant detector part and its function in detail and helps the students to remember, as they get more involved and connected than by simply listening to a presentation. Impressions from the first event of this kind, held at NBI in Copenhagen, can be seen in Figure 4. These events can easily be adapted to any grade in school.

## 3 Build Your Own Particle Detector

The idea for "Build Your Own Particle Detector" [3] was born in mid 2013, in preparation for the Passreport Big Bang [15] inauguration event at CERN, to further develop the idea of events that involve active contributions from the visitors. To additionally enhance the engagement, these events are usually held in the form of competitions, giving the visitors the chance to win particle physics related prizes. A detailed description of the implementation and necessary preparations for such an interactive BYOPD event will be given in the following sections.

Over the past years, BYOPD has evolved to be the home not only for the two types of outreach events, both in small groups of students and in larger public competitions, but also to various LEGO-made detector models. By now, this includes both the large and the small ATLAS model, two matching LEGO models of the CMS experiment, shown in Figure 5, and the LHC micro models, shown in Figure 6. The two CMS LEGO models were designed by Jaime Gomez, Jeff Temple and Marguerite Tonjes of the high energy physics group at the University of Maryland in 2012 and joined the BYOPD web site in 2014. The LHC micro models, designed by Nathan Readioff of University of Liverpool in 2014, joined the BYOPD web site early 2015, matching the start of the associated LEGO Ideas campaign [16].

By now, more than a dozen BYOPD events have been carried out, with more than 50 students building the large ATLAS LEGO model and close to 600 participants in modelling competitions. Since August 2013 BYOPD is also present in social media [17] as described the following sections.

### Public Events

The first public BYOPD event took place during the Passeport Big Bang [15] inauguration at CERN in June 2013. Since then, these model building competitions have been arranged about a dozen times at various occasions. Some impressions can be seen in Figure 7.

The basic idea behind these events is to mix active participation of visitors in a design and building competition with the unique chance to talk to them about particle physics in a very relaxed environment. This is done by providing enough LEGO pieces for several people to design and build at the same time and enough volunteers to entertain and educate participants and their company. There is essentially no limitation on the target audience other than the minimum age of four years as suggested by The LEGO Group, as the level of information one can convey should be adjusted to each individual participant and their company. Thereby, this activity works well not only for children, but also for teenagers and adults, both as participants and as an accompanying person. The latter, especially in cases where they come with a child bound by a pile of LEGO pieces, probably make up the main target audience.

Usually participants are asked to design, build and name a "particle detector", or whatever they think a "particle detector" should or does look like. It does not really matter whether the event offers the chance to actually see a real particle physics experiment before the participants are asked to design their own, as it has been found not to matter much in the end. In any case, the volunteers will have the chance to discuss the design and operation of both the participant's model and real experiments. After the participants have finished building their "particle detector" and have given it a name, they are ready to enter the competition. To do so, one of the volunteers will take a picture of the model along with a ticket featuring a unique model number, as shown in Figure 8, and the participants are asked to register their design together with their name, email address and model number via the BYOPD web site [3]. Thereafter they are asked to disassemble the model and return the LEGO pieces to the common pile for others to reuse. By taking identifiable pictures of the models, one not only saves in the number of necessary LEGO pieces, but also gains the chance to present the models on a web site and to continue the competition in social media, as described in the following section. At the end of the event, the best and most witty models can be selected based on the pictures and the detector names. Prizes, ideally already presented during the event, are usually sent out by regular mail within the following week and comprise anything from particle physics merchandise, over books to guided tours through labs and experiments. As an immediate reward and to motivate the participation in the event, small prizes, such as stickers, pens or buttons, can be handed out to the participants once they registered.

Checklist for hosting a BYOPD event:

* contact info@build-your-own-particle-detector.org (lots of things are already in place and available from BYOPD)
* at least two to three volunteers at any given time (every extra person, is a person to actually do outreach and explain things)
* incentive prizes for the best models (remember to display them during the event)
* give-away prizes for every registered participant (to give immediate reward and to create additional motivation to participate)
* one or more large tables, preferentially with benches on each side (chairs are fine, though take up more space)
* reasonable pile of random LEGO pieces (20 to 40 kg have proven to be enough and can be provided by BYOPD)
* event registered at the BYOPD web site [3] to accept registrations (BYOPD can set up a registration form online)
* tickets to enter the competition (used to anonymously identify models and provided by BYOPD)
* a digital camera to take pictures of the models along with a ticket (allows to reuse the pieces of a given model for later models)
* a computer with internet connection to register the models (participant's name, model name, email address and ticket number)
* have the pictures uploaded to the BYOPD web site [3] and Facebook page [17] (to further spread the word and create attention even after the actual event)

### Web and Social Activity

The BYOPD web site [3], complemented by an associated Facebook page [17], is the central hub for all activities. It features information, galleries, statistics and construction manuals for all available LEGO models and is used to announce and advertise BYOPD events and news of all kinds. BYOPD competitions, as described in the previous section, are complemented by online audience awards. These audience awards, having people vote for their favourite models on the BYOPD Facebook page, not only create additional attention and help spread the word to a larger community, but also extend the experience for the individual participant and help to turn the events into a long-lasting memory.

## 4 Summary and Outlook

Using LEGO pieces to build models of a particle physics experiments, such as the ATLAS detector, has proven to be a perfect mean to grasp people's attention and still be able to convey all the necessary details of such experiments to make it a valuable tool in explaining the detectors as well as the physics. The large ATLAS LEGO model has been a huge success and is used for outreach activities at 57 institutes in 16 countries worldwide.

In the same way, it has been shown that inviting smaller groups of students to build detector models in LEGO pieces as part of an intense outreach event or calling a broader audience to take part in competitions to build their own ideas of a "particle detector" in LEGO pieces creates a unique setting to convey knowledge in particle physics to them.

The "Build Your Own Particle Detector" programme is looking forward to many more events, creative and fun ideas of people taking part in the competitions, new means of using the detector LEGO models in outreach and chances to get people interested in and fascinated by particle physics.
