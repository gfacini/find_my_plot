###### Abstract

In the present note the performance of the proposed ATLAS-Level 1-\(E_{T}^{miss}\) trigger is presented. The general performance is studied in terms of the resolution of the \(E_{x}\) and \(E_{y}\) component of the total energy sum. The resolution is studied as a function of the total energy \(\sum E_{T}\) using QCD jet events. In the simulation the response of the level-1 trigger electronics chain is properly taken into account.

Introduction

Missing transverse energy will be one of the distinct signatures at LHC to select interesting physics processes. Many extensions of the Standard Model include weakly interacting particles which, if produced at LHC will escape detection. Their presence will however be signalled by an imbalance of transverse momentum.

Among the basic building blocks of the level-1 calorimeter trigger is the summation of the total transverse energy deposited in the calorimeters. Together with the scalar sum \(\sum E_{T}\) also the components \(E_{x}\) and \(E_{y}\) in the plane transverse to the beam axis are computed in the jet/energy-sum processor of the level-1 trigger. Although the \(E_{T}^{miss}\)-trigger itself is not included in the basic level-1 triggers [1], it's combination with the single jet and tau triggers is important to allow for triggering on interesting events with low jet or tau thresholds.

The performance of the \(E_{T}^{miss}\)-trigger can be parametrized independent of the special event types and physics processed considered, by it's resolution function. This resolution function is generally found to depend on the total transverse energy deposited in the calorimeters [2]. QCD 2-jet events dominate the high-\(E_{T}\) cross section at LHC and provide a variety of \(\sum E_{T}\) and show no intrinsic \(E_{T}^{miss}\). Apart from neutrinos in the fragmentation cascade no non interacting particles are present. Of particular importance to the level-1 trigger is the question by how much the \(E_{T}^{miss}\) performance/resolution is degraded by the level-1 hardware realization, including FADC digitization, threshold setting, signal transmission with a limited number of bits as well as the adder tree in the summation chain.

The study of these effects is described in Section 3 of the present note after a description of the simulation chain in Section 2.

## 2 The simulation chain

The present simulations are based on the ATLAS fast simulation programme ATLFAST [4]. The physics generator PYTHIA [5] is used to generate the physics events. With respect to the standard version some modifications have been made to ATLFAST. They mainly concern the response and the resolution of the calorimeters together with a correct description of the longitudinal energy sharing between the electromagnetic and the hadronic calorimeters. The calorimeter response and resolution functions have been determined from a full ATLAS GEANT simulation for both single charged pions and photons in the full energy range of interest, from 200 MeV up to 100 GeV.

In the same simulation the energy dependent longitudinal energy sharing in the calorimeters has been determined. Whereas the response and resolution curves have been parametrized the distributions obtained for the longitudinal sharing were directly used in the fast simulation. Random numbers are taken directly from the obtained distributions. It should be noted that all effects of energy losses in the tracking detectors and in the insensitive material are taken into account in the response and resolution functions.

The deposited energies in the calorimeters are summed into trigger towers with granularities in \(\Delta\eta\times\Delta\phi\) according to the proposed trigger cell granularities over the full range of pseudorapidities(mainly 0.1 \(\times\) 0.1, except in the endcap regions). Electronic noise is added for each trigger tower, assuming Gaussian distributions with standard deviations as given in the ATLAS calorimeter TDRs [6]. For the high luminosities studies pileup is added according to the prescription as given in Ref. [3]. In this procedure correct shaping functions of the various calorimeter types are taken into account. The complete electronics chain as realized in the level-1 trigger preprocessor, consisting of a FADC with a dynamic range up to 255 GeV, bunch crossing identification (BCID), as well as the data compression in a look-up table are simulated.

In a final step the calorimeter energies are summed into a map with a granularity of \(\Delta\eta\times\Delta\phi=0.2\times\,0.2\). This map contains the basic energy information for the jet/energy-sum processor, whereas the cluster preressor uses the original maps with a granularity of \(\Delta\eta\times\Delta\phi=0.1\times\,0.1\). In this context the dynamic range used in the summing into the 0.2 \(\times\) 0.2 map is an additional parameter which will also be investigated in the following.

## 3 Performance of the \(E_{t}^{miss}\) trigger

### \(E_{t}^{miss}\) resolution

The \(E_{T}^{miss\,\ast}\) resolution as a function of the total transverse energy in the event has been determined at the various steps of the level-1 trigger hardware. The present simulation has been carried out assuming low and high luminosity, i. e. superposition of 2.3 and 23 minimum bias events per bunch crossing. The rms width of the distribution of the components _E\({}_{x}\)_ and _E\({}_{y}\)_ of the total energy sum are used as a measure of the resolution. As an example Fig.1 shows the distribution of \(P_{x}\) for jets with a total transverse energy in the range between 300 and 350 GeV at the various steps of the simulation. The resolution is significantly affected by the calorimeter resolution and response as well as by the addition of electronic noise in the tower builder electronics. The numbers are summarized again in Table 1.

The noise contributions can however be suppressed by the signal handling in the preprocessor frontend. After BCID is performed the information is sent through an 8-bit lookup table, i.e. having a LSB corresponding to 1 GeV. For the particular _E\({}_{T}\)_ range considered, the resolution is not further degraded in the summation steps where the jet elements are summed with a granularity of \(\Delta\eta\times\Delta\phi=0.2\times\) 0.2. In this summation the maximal possible bit count is increased from 8 to 10 bits. In the particular example considered, no losses are seen if the transmission to the jet/energy-sum processor is performed with an 8 or 9 bit scale.

More general, the dependence of the rms values on the total value of

a) low luminosity (no min. bias event$)

b) high luminosity (23 min. bias events)\(\sum E_{T}\) is shown for some of the steps mentioned above in Fig.2. It should be noted that the rms values are computed including the non Gaussian tails. Therefore they are bound to be larger than the values obtained in offline analyses and do not follow the expected scaling with \(\sqrt{\sum E_{T}}\). As can be seen from a comparision of the various curves, the resolution obtained at the calorimeter level can nearly be achieved at the trigger level up to very high values of \(\sum E_{T}\). For \(\sum E_{T}\) below \(\sim\)1000 GeV, which corresponds to a typical 2-jet event with \(E_{T}\)-values of \(\sim\)500 GeV, no losses due to the FADC cutoff at 256 GeV are visible. Beyond that value the tails in the distributions increase significantly. This value is however high enough such that the overall performance of the level-1 trigger is not affected and the trigger rates are not increased significantly. These simulations have been repeated for a high luminosity scenario. Results are shown in Fig.2b). As can be seen, the resolution is significantly degraded by the pileup events.

### Number of bits in the signal transmission

After the summing of the trigger tower energies into the jet maps with a granularity of \(\Delta\eta\times\Delta\phi=0.2\times 0.2\) at the end of the preprocessor, the maximal signal range is increased to 10 bits. The question has been investigated whether 8, 9 or 10 bits should be used in the transmission of the signals to the jet/energy-sum processor. The results are shown in Fig.3. For the proposed 9-bit transmission no significant degradation has been found. This is also true for a transmission using only 8 bits, such that from the point of the \(P_{T}^{miss}\) trigger performance it must be concluded that an 8 bit transmisson would be sufficient.

### The adder tree

Finally the hardware summation tree as proposed for the calculation of \(E_{x}\), \(E_{y}\) and \(\sum E_{T}\) in the jet processor has been studied. The results are shown in Fig.4 for the various summation steps, which consist of:

* summation of the electromagnetic and the hadronic calorimeter energies with a granularity of \(\Delta\eta\times\Delta\phi=0.2\times 0.2\) (max. signal range: 10 bits)* summation of two cells in \(\eta\), \(\Delta\eta\times\Delta\phi\) = 0.4 \(\times\) 0.2, (max. signal range: 11 bits)
* transformation to \(E_{x}\) and \(E_{y}\) using 12 bit lookup tables
* summation over \(\phi\) in four quadrants, i.e. \(\Delta\eta\times\Delta\phi\) = 0.4 \(\times\) 1.6
* summation over the full range in \(\eta\) (12 bits)
* summation over the four \(\phi\) quadrants (12 bits), applying the appropriate signs

As can be seen from Fig.4, at low luminosity the resolution is not further degraded in any of the summation steps. It can therefore be concluded that the proposed hardware concept for the \(E_{T}^{miss}\) summing is adequate.

Figure 4: _Dependence of the resolution of the \(E_{x},\,E_{y}\)-component of the total transverse momentum on \(\sum E_{T}\) for the various steps in the adder tree._

### Studies of \(E_{t}\)-thresholds

As mentioned in section 3.1 the electronic noise contributions can be suppressed by the signal handling in the lookup table of the preprocessor, which implies a threshold at 1 GeV for the electromagnetic as well as for the hadronic calorimeter. In the following it has been studied whether the resolution can be improved by applying even higher thresholds in the **high** luminosity case, with the aim to suppress pileup noise. In Fig.5 resolution functions are shown for equal thresholds in the electromagnetic and hadronic calorimeters. In Fig.6 the resolution functions for different thresholds in the electromagnetic calorimeter only are plotted. As can be seen, applying higher thresholds does not lead to further suppression of pileup noise for \(\sum E_{T}\) greater than 200 GeV. In this range the resolution decreases with higher thresholds.

One can either set or not set a threshold on both the electromagnetic and the hadronic calorimeters. Therefore there are four cases to be considered.

1. No threshold at all

2. Threshold on Ecal only

3. Threshold on Hcal only

4. Thresholds on both

It has been found that the resolution decreases with higher thresholds and in the above order.

Figure 6: _Different thresholds for electromagnetic calorimeter.The threshold for the hadronic calorimeter is 1 GeV_

### \(E_{T}^{miss}\)-resolution derived from trigger jets

Another algorithm to calculate \(E_{T}^{miss}\) is not to sum over all trigger towers, but over the trigger jets only. As can be seen in Fig.7 the resolution decreases drastically in this case.

This method can therefore not be considered as a viable alternative for the \(E_{T}^{miss}\) calculation.

### Physics processes with intrinsic \(E_{T}^{miss}\)

As described in Section 1, only processes with no intrinsic \(E_{T}^{miss}\) have been studied so far. One possible physics process to study the correlation between the true missing transverse energy and the reconstructed one in the level-1 processor, is the \(W\to e\)\(\nu_{e}\) production.

The correlation between the reconstructed \(E_{T}^{miss}\) and the \(E_{T}\) of the neutrino is shown in Fig. 8 for the three luminosity scenarios. In this plot only those events enter which pass a rough selection, which is applied to select \(W\to e\)\(\nu_{e}\) at the analysis level. It is required that the electron is in the pseudorapidity interval \(|\,\eta\,\,|<2.5\) and has a transverse momentum above 25 GeV. As expected, there exists a correlation between the reconstructed missing transverse energy and the true neutrino transverse energy. The resolution is however rather corse and increases with the total transverse energy. The ratio between the reconstructed \(E_{T}^{miss}\) and \(E_{T}^{\nu}\) is shown in Fig. 9 again for the three luminosity scenarios. Since the calorimeter response in the fast simulation is based on the hadronic scale, the electron energy, which determines the \(E_{T}^{miss}\) is overestimated by about 20%.

The width of this distribution is found to be in agreement with the resolution function extracted for QCD jet events. As an example, the distribution of \((p_{X}^{MC}-p_{X}^{LVL1})\) is shown in Fig. 10 for events having a total transverse momentum in the range between 200 and 250 GeV. This distribution is found to have a width of 10 GeV, whereas from the parametrization given above a width of 11 GeV is expected.

## 4 Conclusions

The \(E_{T}^{miss}\) resolution of the ATLAS level-1 trigger has been studied as a function of the total transverse energy in QCD two jet events. The resolution at the trigger level is found to be close to the resolution found at the calorimeter level over a large range of \(\sum E_{T}\). The cut off at an energy of 256 GeV per trigger tower in the preprocessor affects the resolution only for events with \(\sum E_{T}\) beyond \(\sim 1000\) GeV. This degradation has however only a small effect on the trigger rate and on the trigger efficiency.

The data transmission from the preprocessor to the jet/\(\sum E_{T}\) processor with 9 bits as well as the adder tree in the \(\sum E_{T}\) processor seem to be adequate and do not further degrade the resolution.

Due to pileup the resolution is found to be degraded at high luminosity. This degradation can not be improved upon if higher thresholds are applied to the electromagnetic and/or hadronic trigger towers. Therefore, from the point of the \(E_{T}^{miss}\) trigger, there is no need to foresee additional thresholds. There might however be different conclusions on that point from other triggers.
