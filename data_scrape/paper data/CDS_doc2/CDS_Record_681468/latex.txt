**Abstract**

Muon chambers in the LHC experiments and in particular in Atlas will have to work under substantial background rates both of photons and neutrons. While the basic effects of high background rates were already studied in the past with the help of dedicated setups ([1],[2]), it became possible for the first time in 2002 to study the performance of production MDT chambers with a prototype of the final front end electronics under high photon irradiation.

This note presents the outcome of such a study at the CERN **G**amma **I**rradiation **F**acility GIF carried out in summer 2002. A BIS chamber and an additional small chamber of 24 MDTs, commonly referred to as "bundle", were used for the tests. 100 GeV muons from the X5 beam line were available in addition to an intense adjustable photon flux generated by a \({}^{137}\)Cs radioactive source. In the following, BIS results on MDT resolution, efficiency and drift properties as a function of the background level are presented. Where possible the experimental findings are compared to results from simulations. Particular emphasis is further put on discussing where special care and/or methods are needed when analysing high background data without the benefit of an external tracker.

The bundle chamber was used to perform a first investigation in high rate environment of possible effects connected to the use of a serial gas distribution system for the MDTs.

The 2002 MDT beam test at X5/GIF was also planned as a test bed to validate the (prototype) Atlas MDT front end electronics under high rate conditions. Special attention was therefore paid to any possible evidence for lost/missed hits.

Background environment at the LHC

Uncorrelated photon background in the Atlas muon spectrometer is for a large part created from low energetic neutrons via (n,\(\gamma\))-reactions, where the neutrons stem from the interaction of hadrons with detector or machine elements. Figure 1 shows expected count rates caused by uncorrelated background in the muon spectrometer precision chambers, while Figure 2 shows a more detailed simulation of the expected photon flux only. MDT count rates due to background are highest in the inner stations of the endcaps.

### Requirements for MDT rate capability

From Figure 1 one can see that the maximum expected count rate due to background events in any part of the MDT system is around \(100\,\mathrm{Hz/cm^{2}}\). Since small modifications in the design or material choices for components shielding the muon chambers from the interaction point can affect the expected background environment, the required rate capabilities have been set at 5 times the maximum expected values for each detector type in the muon spectrometer. For the MDTs, this amounts to \(500\,\mathrm{Hz/cm^{2}}\) or \(1500\,\mathrm{Hz/cm}\) as the maximum rate the drift tubes and read out electronics have to be able to sustain.

Figure 1: Expected total count rate due to uncorrelated background in the Atlas muon precision chambers at a luminosity of \(10^{34}\,s^{-1}\,\mathrm{cm^{-2}}\)[3]. The maximum expected rate in the MDT system is approximately 100 Hz/\(\mathrm{cm^{2}}\). No safety factor is included in these estimates.

## 2 Experimental setup

The high rate studies presented in this note were carried out using a BIS type chamber4 with 240 tubes grouped into \(2\times 4\) layers. The BIS tube length is 170 cm. During the 2002 test beam period the chamber was mounted with the tubes in a vertical direction to avoid any potential complication due to sagging of the wires. The chamber was supported by a prototype set of BIS kinematic mounts.

Footnote 4: module zero ”Beatrice”

A small chamber, commonly referred to as "the bundle", was installed in front of the BIS in order to study the behaviour of MDT chambers equipped with serial gas distribution. The bundle is made of BIL tubes (280 cm length) arranged in 4 layers of 6 tubes each. One layer was disconnected from HV and gas distribution because of a broken pin connector. Figure 3 shows the combined setup of BIS and bundle. The distance to the radioactive source was about 2 meters. In this configuration, the full length of the BIS tubes and approximately 80% of the bundle tubes were exposed to the direct photon flux. For autocalibration studies the whole setup could be rotated around the vertical axis up to \(\pm 20\) degrees.

### Gas System and Slow Control

Both multilayers of the BIS chamber were equipped with a fully parallel gas system (brass tubelet version). For pressure and flow regulation, the same setup was used as for the evaluation of the MDT gas circulation system, with the major difference that during test beam data taking the BIS multilayers were operated in open, one-pass mode with all gas re-circulation switched off. For further details on the system the reader is referred to [4]. For BIS the main gas parameters were

Figure 2: Simulated photon flux (kHz/cm\({}^{2}\)) in the Atlas cavern and detector at a luminosity of \(10^{34}\)\(s^{-1}\)cm\({}^{-2}\)[3]. The position of the muon precision chambers is outlined. To get actual detector count rates the numbers shown must be multiplied with the chamber efficiency. The figure does not include safety factors on the quoted rates.

* 3 bar (abs.) operating pressure
* gas composition Ar:CO\({}_{2}\) = 93:7 from premixed supply
* Gas flow of 20 Nl/h per multilayer, corresponding to 1 volume exchange per day.

For what concerns the bundle, the 6 tubes in each layer were connected in series. The tightness of the chamber was seriously compromised by the fact that the gas bar was not fixed on the tubes. Any torque on the gas inlet or outlet was transferred on the tubelets and provoked leaks. The situation was worsened by the fact that plastic piping could not be used in order to avoid water contamination, and the stainless steel piping was quite stiff. The net result was that the bundle was leaking two orders of magnitudes more than the Atlas specifications.

The bundle gas composition was the same as for the BIS chamber, coming from the same premixed supply; the pressure was regulated to 2 bar overpressure with respect to atmospheric pressure. Since the drift properties of a MDT are a function of the absolute

Figure 3: Setup at GIF during the May/June 2002 test beam. Both the BIS chamber and the small Rome-built bundle have their tubes in a vertical orientation. The position was chosen such that the full BIS chamber was illuminated by \(\gamma\)-radiation if the GIF source was ”on”.

pressure, the use of a relative pressure controller was unfortunate and complicated the analysis. The bundle was operated at a gas flow of 2.4 l/h, corresponding to one volume exchange every two days.

During data taking all gas flows and pressures as well as the chambers' temperatures, the applied high voltages and the currents drawn by the 2 BIS multilayers were read out every minute and recorded on file. The atmospheric pressure was recorded by the Slow Control system of the Atlas RPC ageing test.

### Front end electronics and DAQ

Since part of the study at X5/GIF was to test the Atlas electronics and read-out chain under high occupancy/rate conditions, the full BIS chamber (240 channels) was equipped with front end boards and read out, despite the fact that the spot size of the X5 muon beam has a diameter of 10 to 15 cm only. The following components were used:

* 10+1+1 mezzanine-lite cards (AMT-1, ASD-lite): 10 on the BIS, 1 on the bundle, 1 to record the timing of the trigger signal
* Atlas prototype high voltage hedgehog boards
* Atlas prototype signal hedgehogs, unshielded
* 1 18-channel CSM adapter for powering the front end boards and distribution of JTAG signals
* 1 CSM0 module for event building and controlling the front end electronics
* Charge integrating Camac ADCs LeCroy 2249W on every third BIS channel to record the pulse height (more precisely: pulse charge). Analogue debugging outputs on the mezzanine-lite boards were used for these measurements[5].

Due to the high radiation levels at GIF a large part of the read out electronics had to be placed outside the actual GIF zone. Cable lengths between the front end electronics (CSM adapter) and the CSM0 amounted to 25 m. A specially designed LVDS retransmitter had to be used to ensure proper communication between CSM0 and mezzanine boards.

The VME crate housing the CSM0 was interfaced to a PC running Windows 95 via National Instruments' VXI-MXI2 bus. Camac modules were read out with the help of the VME module CBD 8210 (Camac branch driver, CES). For data acquisition a modified version of the software "MiniDAQ" developed at the University of Michigan [5] was used. With respect to the original MiniDAQ code, the X5 version featured an online event display, an extended logging of JTAG and other relevant settings and the capability of reading out Camac modules. An instantaneous data transfer via TCP/IP to a second PC running under Linux was also implemented, in order to allow a quasi-online analysis. Both data originating from the Slow Control and from the DAQ were automatically copied to the CERN tape storage system CASTOR via Central Data Recording (CDR) services running on the Linux PC mentioned.

### Trigger

For data taking at GIF two different trigger types are needed: the conventional beam trigger and a so called "random trigger" uncorrelated to the muon beam for \(\gamma\)-rate measurements. The beam trigger was implemented as a coincidence of 3 plastic scintillators arranged in such a way that their overlap (\(16\times 16\,\mathrm{cm}^{2}\)) was centered on the beam line. To minimise the effect of time-jitter on the precision of the trigger signal, constant fraction discriminators (CAEN CFD V812B) were used with the scintillator photomultiplier signals. In order to avoid triggering on accidental coincidences caused by the high photon background, the scintillator setup was placed behind a concrete wall to shield it from the GIF radiation zone (Figure 4). Generation of triggers was blocked with the help of the two SPS control signals "EE" (end of extraction) and "WE" (warning extraction) outside a spill to reduce the fraction of cosmics in the collected data.

A timing unit was used as pulse generator for trigger signals uncorrelated to particles in the beam; by counting the number of hits recorded by the AMT in the total time interval

\[\Delta t=\text{number of triggers}\cdot\text{ AMT match window}, \tag{1}\]

the count rate due to \(\gamma\)-radiation could be obtained. During such measurements the SPS signals were interchanged so that triggers were only allowed outside of a SPS spill.

The hardware trigger signal was used in 5 different locations, namely (see also Figure 5)

* as trigger input to the CSM0,

Figure 4: Setup at GIF during the May/June 2002 test beam. The combination BIS and bundle was situated in a distance of approximately 2 meters from the \({}^{137}\)Cs \(\gamma\)-source. The scintillator beam trigger system was placed such that it was shielded from the radiation area by a concrete wall.

* to generate the gate for the pulse height ADCs (fixed gate width of \(1\,\mu\)s),
* as start signal for LeCroy Camac TDCs 2228 connected to the scintillators of the beam trigger,
* as injection signal into an additional mezzanine card off the chambers,
* to generate a "DAQ busy" veto on the coincidence unit and thus to block further triggers until read out of the present event was finished. A CERN-EP Status-A Camac module was used for this purpose which comprises a flip flop set to "high" by an input NIM signal and which is reset via Camac.

The signal (d) allowed to correct during offline analysis for the uncertainty in the drift time measurements introduced by the CSM0 passing triggers to the AMT only with the next rising edge of its internal 25 ns clock. (e) ensured a strict single event data acquisition mode. Such a mode of operation is not strictly necessary for the CSM0-AMT chain which in principle can handle multiple triggers internally by disabling and re-enabling its trigger queue when buffers are getting full. For the X5 test, this mode was chosen in first place

Figure 5: Schematic overview of the trigger setup. During beam data taking the coincidence of 3 plastic scintillators is used as hardware trigger signal. Each generated trigger blocks the coincidence unit for further triggers via a CERN-EP Camac Status A unit until the event is read out and the Veto cleared by the DAQ. The SPS ”end of extraction” (EE) and ”warning extraction” (WE) signals are utilised to disable triggers outside the SPS spill. In place of the scintillator signals a periodic signal from a timing unit can be used as input to the coincidence (not shown) in order to generate triggers uncorrelated to the beam for \(\gamma\)-rate measurements.

because the 2249W ADCs can only handle single events and also to avoid the complication of having to match the different queue lengths on the various levels of the AMT and CSM0.

### Dealing with DAQ hang ups

The chain AMT1-CSM0 was known already before the 2002 test beam to suffer from hang ups with the symptom that one or more of the AMTs do not "see" the encoded trigger signal sent out by the CSM. The result is that the AMT(s) concerned do not transmit any data back to the CSM which in turn does not complete the event building step. In such a case the read out gets inevitably stuck in the single event acquisition mode described above.

In the X5 setup such hang ups are dealt with in the following way: in addition to polling the CSM for an Event-Ready flag, the DAQ also checks the Status-A Camac module for a LAM ("Look-At-Me") signal which is established when the module receives a trigger input. If LAM is present but no CSM Event-Ready can be found within a period of time larger than the maximum time needed for event processing (in the X5 environment typically 50 \(\mu\)s), the system is declared as stuck and a reset signal is issued via VME to the CSM. Finally it should be noted that due to the single event data acquisition mode and the relatively slow speed of the performed Camac operations **the minimum time between consecutive triggers is \(\geq\)**300 \(\mu\)s. Under these conditions, a known bug in the logic of AMT1 and AMT2 leading to some hits being lost (and thus a reduced efficiency) does not manifest itself**[6].

## 3 Collected data and run environment

During the 7 days of data taking at X5/GIF altogether nearly 33 million events were collected for test beam muons. This section summarises the main characteristics of the GIF \(\gamma\)-background environment and the X5 muon beam during the period of measurement.

### Photon background

The 680 GBq \({}^{137}Cs\) source at GIF emits photons of 660 keV energy. Part of the photon flux is scattered on the walls and floor of the experimental zone resulting in a broad spectrum of energies smaller than 660 keV in addition to the sharp primary peak. For a MDT the detection efficiency for photon of a few 100 keV is below 1% [7]. The dominant interaction mechanism is via Compton scattering in the aluminium tube wall and, to a lower extent, in the operating gas. The energy deposited in a MDT as consequence of a Compton process shows a broad distribution with a long tail towards high energies. From measured tube count rates and the current drawn by the chamber, the average number of primary electrons created in the gas by one interacting photon can be calculated as

\[\vec{N}_{p.e.}=\frac{I_{chamber}}{G\cdot\sum_{i}\vec{N}_{count,i}} \tag{2}\]

for a gas gain \(G\) and individual tube count rates \(\vec{N}_{count,i}\).

Following this method a value of

\[\vec{N}_{p.e.}=128\,5\pm 20\% \tag{3}\]

was determined for the BIS chamber in the study presented.

### Determining photon count rates

The basic idea of measuring \(\gamma\)-rates with the help of a so called "random" trigger uncorrelated to the beam was already described in section 2.3. The method is complicated by the fact that the ASD-lite doesn't have a dead time large enough to ensure a single threshold crossing ("hit") per event, different from the final Atlas version. The average number of hits per \(\gamma\)-event6 at GIF is around 3.

To deal with multiple threshold crossings, only the first hit found by the AMT in its match time-window is counted. Count rates calculated in this way as

Footnote 6: Compton-electrons above some 10 keV energy behave similarly to muons by ionising the gas along a track. The consequence is as for muons a series of hits due to different ionisation clusters.

\[\dot{N}_{count}=\frac{\mbox{\it total number of }first\ hits}{\mbox{\it total time interval }\Delta t} \tag{4}\]

are too small since not only multiple hits from the same event, but also hits from a second event within the same AMT match window are suppressed. This can be corrected for in the following way:

Assume the 'true' count rate is R. Then the probability to observe one or more hits in a single AMT match interval \(\Delta t_{\mathit{AMT}}\) is

\[\int_{0}^{\Delta t_{\mathit{AMT}}}R\cdot e^{-R\cdot t}dt=1-e^{-R\cdot\Delta t_ {\mathit{AMT}}}.\]

If the total number of considered AMT match intervals is \(n\), then on average

\[n\cdot(1-e^{-R\cdot\Delta t_{\mathit{AMT}}})\]

of them contain one or more hits. According to Equation (4) one would calculate a rate

\[R^{\prime}=\frac{n\cdot(1-e^{-R\cdot\Delta t_{\mathit{AMT}}})}{n\cdot\Delta t_ {\mathit{AMT}}}\enspace. \tag{5}\]

Equation (5) can be solved for the true count rate \(R\). The difference between a rate calculated according to Equation (4) and the value one gets using the correction described exceeds 10% for \(R\cdot\Delta t_{\mathit{AMT}}\geq 0.2\).

Finally, it should be noted that only AMT match intervals where there was no hit seen in the 500 ns preceding the start of the match window7, were used for rate determination. This prevented counting secondary threshold crossings of events for which the first hit was outside the actual time window.

Footnote 7: This information is available from the AMT mask word with a mask window programmed to 500 ns.

### \(\gamma\)-background uniformity

The infrastructure at GIF includes a set of fixed and movable lead filters between the \({}^{137}C_{8}\)-source and the chambers under study. The purpose of these filters is to allow the photon flux incident on the user setups to be adjusted over several orders of magnitude. Equally important, they ensure that the photon flux is constant over a plane in a fixed distance from the source rather than on the surface of a sphere (\(1/r^{2}\) attenuation law).

Figure 6 shows measured BIS tube count rates for various filter settings. Two things should be noted: the decrease in count rate is less pronounced than it would be expected from the nominal filter attenuation factors; this is due to the high percentage of photonsFigure 6: Photon background for BIS. The top figure shows the average tube count rate per mezzanine card for the first multilayer and different lead absorption filters. Error bars correspond to the variation of the rate within each card. The curves for different mezzanines do not coincide; this is a clear evidence for the \(\gamma\)-irradiation being non-uniform across the chamber width. The bottom figure shows the rate variation in more detail for the maximum level of background. In the region covered by the muon beam the background changes by almost a factor 2.

losing only a part of their energy in Compton-interactions with the filter material rather then being fully absorbed. More important is the fact the photon flux was by no means uniform across the 90 cm wide BIS chamber, in contrast with the measurements performed when commissioning the GIF [8]. Unfortunately, even in the much smaller region covered by the muon beam \(\gamma\)-rates varied by almost a factor 2. The observed non-uniformity of the radiation background was attributed to uneven shielding effects of several small size setups present for parasitic ageing between the \({}^{137}Cs\)-source and the MDT setup.

### X5 muon beam

During the 2002 MDT tests the X5 beam line was operated in tertiary mode (primary SPS protons \(\rightarrow\) target T1 \(\rightarrow\) secondary beam H3 at 120 GeV, negative polarity \(\rightarrow\) secondary target \(\rightarrow\) X5 beam at 100 GeV negative polarity). A 5.40 m iron dump in front of the GIF zone stopped all particles except muons. Depending on whether the additional dumps upstream of the X5A area and between X5A and X5B were in the beam line or not the diameter of the beam spot in GIF varied between 10 and 20 cm with muon count rates between 2000 and 6000 particles per spill during the period of data taking.

### Shower production and off-beam particles

Figure 7 shows measured beam-related particle rates during the SPS spill (GIF \(\gamma\)-radiation "switched" off). One can see that there is a significant level of interactions outside the actual beam core. If one assumes that the beam dimension is also 15 cm in the vertical direction and that the rate distribution outside the beam core is flat (which is substantiated by Figure 7), one gets a ratio of roughly 20:1 for particle intensities in- and outside the beam region, taking into the account that the 170 cm-long BIS MDTs integrate the rate along their axis.

Figure 7: Particle count rate across the BIS chamber during SPS spills with no photon background. An almost constant particle rate can be observed across the full chamber width outside the X5 beam core. The same ’random trigger” method was applied as in the \(\gamma\)-rate measurements. (The position of the beam spot is shifted w.r.t. Figure 6 since the chamber was in a slightly different position)

While a relatively large halo is not unusual for a muon beam, it is surprising that most particles observed outside the beam spot are correlated with particles in the beam core: this can be concluded from the fact that the MDTs outside the beam region show a normal drift time spectrum in standard running conditions with the \(16\times 16\) cm\({}^{2}\) scintillator beam trigger (Figure 8). Since only the first hit found within the AMT match window is considered, one would expect an exponential time distribution if the particle causing the trigger signal and the particle registered in a tube were uncorrelated.

A check of hit patterns revealed that events associated with MDT signals outside the direct beam indeed either show double tracks or are shower-like (Figure 9). Correlated double tracks can either be muons originating from the same primary proton (via multiple pion production and subsequent decay) or high-energetic knock-out electrons produced in the beam dump(s).

The origin of the shower-like events is less clear. In principle, high-multiplicity pion products of the initial proton-target reaction could decay into several correlated muons, but the probability of observing such events in X5/GIF should be far smaller than the observed \(\approx 4\,\%\), due to the low intensity of the muon beam (3-4 orders of magnitude compared to the H3 beam incident on the X5 secondary target). Other possible explanations include a (\(\mu\),hadron)- reaction in the last few centimeters of the beam dump immediately upstream of the GIF in which case the shower would be due to hadrons.

All analyses have been restricted to MDTs within the beam region. For resolution and efficiency studies, where a good trigger timing precision is crucial, only events with single tracks have been selected.

Figure 8: Drift time spectra of a tube in the beam core and of an MDT outside the beam region. The number of histogram-entries for tube 11118 outside the beam has been scaled with a factor 10 for clarity of the plot. In both cases the trigger came from the beam scintillators. Except for a slight degradation in rise-time, the ”off-beam” spectrum is identical to the one from a tube directly exposed to the beam.

Results: Read out performance and DAQ hang up rate

During data taking with cosmics, the rate of DAQ hang ups described in Section 2.4 was directly correlated to the number of mezzanine cards. This observation raised the question of whether there is also a dependence on the chamber occupancy. Figure 10 shows the hang up frequency in relation to the GIF photon flux.

Different from the observation made with a BOS chamber at GIF/X5 in august 2002 [9], the hang up probability per event does not show any increase with the tube and thus read-out occupancy. The hang up rate per byte of data decreases; this corroborates the hypothesis that the reason for hang ups is an encoded trigger transmitted from CSM to mezzanines being missed by the AMT. One would expect a constant behaviour if data sent from TDC to CSM being lost for a certain fraction of data words was the cause for the read out getting stuck. It should be noted that any hang up practically disappeared when a periodic pulse generator signal was used as trigger (as for the rate measurements), even at highest \(\gamma\)-background.

In very rare cases (1 or 2 out of half a million events), a second type of hang up was observed, which was characterised by the CSM0 not generating the encoded trigger signal at all. A check of internal CSM signals showed that the hardware trigger was correctly received, but that for hung events the CSM signal STOP sent to its TTCvi chip was "high" (logic "true"). STOP disables the trigger queue in this condition. The problem was finally traced to one of the individual channel input FIFOs of the CSM dual ported RAM exceeding its stop threshold; the data which clogged up the buffer consisted of a large number of AMT error words from the previous event. This error words are cleared from the channel FIFOs and transferred to the VME output FIFO only during the first step of building the following event [6]. Since exceeding the stop threshold on any of the channel FIFOs blocks acceptance of further triggers, in single event acquisition mode the over-full buffer never gets emptied and the system thus becomes stuck.

The large number of found AMT error words wrongly signalled parity errors in the AMT's

Figure 9: Top: double track event as observed with a probability of \(5-6\) %. Bottom: typical shower hit pattern (\(\geq 25\) hits) as found in \(\approx 4\) % of all events.

internal logic due to problems in the AMT1 parity checking and error marking functionality [6],[10]. They were ignored in the data analysis.

## 5 BIS Results: Rt-relation and drift time spectrum changes with photon rate

Figure 11 shows a single tube spectrum with and without presence of a large photon background. The level to which the normal TDC spectrum is hidden by \(\gamma\)-hits depends both on the background count rate and on the fraction of events in which the tube under study was actually crossed by a muon; this fraction depends on the size of the beam region and beam trigger. For high background spectra as the one shown, performing a precise fit to the leading and trailing edge is difficult; a method was developed to unfold the photon

Figure 10: DAQ hang up probability in relation to average tube count rate. The top plot shows the hang up probability per event, the bottom figure shows the hang up rate per byte of data. Both measurements were done for read out of the full BIS and the bundle for beam muon events. Please note the logarithmic scale of the bottom plot.

and muon contributions.

### Unfolding the TDC spectrum

The TDC spectrum of a MDT is a representation of the probability distribution for the arrival time of the **first observed hit** with respect to the trigger signal. If a \(\gamma\)-hit precedes a muon hit, the muon hit is not seen. This has the consequence that the obtained drift time spectrum is not a simple superposition of photon and muon contributions

\[\rho_{observed}(t)\neq\rho_{\mu}(t)+\rho_{\gamma}(t)\,,\]

for probability distributions \(\rho_{\mu}\left(\rho_{\gamma}\right)\) of the first muon (photon) hit arrival time, but has the more complicated form

\[\rho_{observed}(t)=\underbrace{\rho_{\gamma}(t)\cdot\left[1-\int_{t_{0}}^{t} \rho_{\mu}(t^{\prime})dt^{\prime}\right]}_{A}+\underbrace{\rho_{\mu}(t)\cdot \left[1-\int_{t_{0}}^{t}\rho_{\gamma}(t^{\prime})dt^{\prime}\right]}_{B}\,. \tag{6}\]

Expression A is the probability to observe the first \(\gamma\)-hit at time \(t\) and no muon hit at a time \(t^{\prime}<t\); B is the the probability to observe a muon at time \(t\) which is not masked by an earlier photon. \(t_{0}\) is the time of the trigger signal. In the following the necessary steps to solve Equation (6) for the muon time spectrum \(\rho_{\mu}(t)\) will be described.

Figure 11: MDT drift time spectrum with and without photon background. The left plot shows the spectrum for a BIS tube in the muon beam at \(\approx 200\,\)kHz \(\gamma\)-count rate (400 Hz/cm\({}^{2}\)). The right plot shows the spectrum for the same tube when no background radiation is present.

#### The \(\gamma\)-spectrum \(\rho_{\gamma}(t)\):

For photon interactions occurring with a constant rate \(\lambda_{\gamma}\) the waiting time for observation of the first hit follows an exponential distribution

\[\rho_{\gamma}(t)=\lambda_{\gamma}\cdot e^{-\lambda_{\gamma}\cdot t}. \tag{7}\]

When looking at BIS arrival time spectra for pure \(\gamma\)-radiation using the uncorrelated "random" trigger (section 2.3), on a first glance the distributions obtained seem to deviate from the expected exponential relation (Figure 12, black curve and red exponential fit). This is due to the fact that part of the observed hits at small times are secondary threshold crossings from photon events outside the actual AMT match window. If only events which show no hits in the 500 ns preceding the start of the AMT match window are selected with the help of the AMT mask word, the surplus of small arrival times disappears in the distribution (Figure 12, green curve). The histogram now has the expected exponential shape with a \(\lambda_{\gamma}\) corresponding to the measured \(\gamma\)-rate.

Rejection of events with AMT mask flag set for a given tube has been applied to all TDC spectra used for drift time analysis.

#### Obtaining \(\rho_{\mu}(t)\) from the observed TDC spectrum:

In Figure 11 (left plot), entries at times \(t\) earlier than the leading edge or later than the trailing edge of the TDC spectrum are exclusively background hits. Entries with

Figure 12: Time distribution for the first \(\gamma\)-hit observed when using a pulse generator trigger uncorrelated to the beam. Triggers were disabled during a SPS spill to guarantee a pure photon data sample. The top black curve shows the obtained histogram if no events are rejected. In this case the distribution can not be fitted with an exponential (red line). For the green curve, events for which a hit was seen in the 500 ns preceding the actual AMT match window were rejected. The resulting histogram can very well be described by an exponential (blue line).

\(t>t_{\mathit{trailing}}\) come from events where the tube under study was not crossed by the beam muon triggered on (otherwise this muon would have caused a histogram entry at a time smaller than the trailing edge which in turn would have masked the \(\gamma\)-hit). In a first step an exponential is fitted to this part of the time distribution. The exponential is extrapolated to earlier \(t\) and subtracted from the observed TDC spectrum \(\rho_{\mathit{observed}}\). The result is \(\rho^{\prime}_{\mathit{observed}}\).

Next \(\rho^{\prime}_{\mathit{observed}}\) is fitted in the region \(t<t_{\mathit{leading}}\) with a second exponential, giving the photon arrival time distribution \(\rho_{\gamma}(t)\) in Equation (6). This equation can be reformulated as

\[\rho_{\mu}(t)=\frac{\rho^{\prime}_{\mathit{observed}}(t)-\rho_{\gamma}(t)\cdot \left[1-\int_{t_{0}}^{t}\rho_{\mu}(t^{\prime})dt^{\prime}\right]}{\left[1-\int_ {t_{0}}^{t}\rho_{\gamma}(t^{\prime})dt^{\prime}\right]} \tag{8}\]

and solved in discrete steps since for a given \(t\) on the left hand side only times \(t^{\prime}<t\) appear on the right hand side.

Figure 13 compares the muon drift time spectra obtained using the unfolding method and using the "naive" approach of subtracting the photon contribution parametrised with an exponential fit of the spectrum for \(t<t_{\mathit{leading}}\). One can clearly see that with the simple subtraction method there is a suppression of large drift times.

#### Advantage and applicability of the unfolding method:

The unfolding method can be applied if the muon component is distinguishable in the raw TDC spectrum. This is necessary to define the different fit regions. For the BIS study at X5 this was the case for all investigated background rates for tubes in the actual beam region. Since the beam spot had a diameter of 10-15 cm, each tube in the beam region had a probability of about 25% of having been crossed by each muon triggered on. This is similar to the future Atlas conditions were the RPCs will allow to determine the track position with a few cm accuracy.

An alternative approach for obtaining the muon component of the TDC spectrum measured in the presence of high background rates is to use pattern recognition techniques. By keeping only hits which belong to identified tracks, the TDC spectrum can be cleaned from \(\gamma\)-hits. It is however not directly possible to recover hits at late drift times which were masked by earlier background hits. The spectrum obtained will therefore still be biased for large drift times. This fact together with not needing computation-intensive tracking was the main reason for choosing the unfolding approach for the BIS analysis.

### \(\mathbf{t}_{\mathit{max}}\) development with background rate

To find the maximum drift time \(t_{\mathit{max}}\) two separate fits were performed on the unfolded TDC spectrum \(\rho_{\mu}(t)\): the leading edge was fitted with a Fermi function

\[f(t)=p_{1}+\frac{p_{2}}{1+e^{-\frac{t-p_{3}}{p_{4}}}},\ \ p_{4}>0\ \,\]

the trailing edge with a modified Fermi function

\[g(t)=q_{1}+\frac{q_{2}+q_{3}\cdot t}{1+e^{-\frac{t-q_{4}}{q_{5}}}},\ \ q_{3},q_{5}<0\ \.\]

\(t_{\mathit{max}}\) was taken as the difference \(t_{\mathit{max}}=q_{4}-p_{3}\).

Figure 14 shows the experimental results for \(t_{max}\) at various background rates. The maximum drift time decreases linearly with increasing count rate. In section 9 it will be shown that the change in drift time can be quantitatively described by a simple model for the space charge created in background events and the subsequent modified electric drift field.

### rt-relations

For resolution and efficiency studies a precise rt-relation is necessary. This was obtained by the usual autocalibration method combining runs for 5 different angles of the chambers with respect to the beam (-12,-7, 0, +7, +15\({}^{o}\)). Autocalibration was performed using tracks over the full BIS chamber (8 tube layers) but allowing for separate rt-relations in the 2

Black: muon TDC spectrum after applying the unfolding method described in the text. Both distributions have been normalised to the same number of entries. One can see that the simple subtraction method suppresses large drift times. The shown data is from a run exceeding the maximum \(\gamma\)-rates expected at Atlas by a factor 1.5.

multilayers (which had slightly different drift times due to individual pressure regulation). For runs with the \(\gamma\)-source switched off, the rt-relation obtained in the H8 2001 test beam was used as starting point. For runs with photon background the initial rt-relation used for autocalibration was taken as

\[r(t) := r_{0}(t)+\delta r(t) \tag{9a}\] \[\delta r(r) = \nu\cdot\left[t\cdot\dot{r}_{0}(t)-r_{0}(t)+\frac{6\cdot ln\frac{ b}{a}}{b^{\,2}}\cdot\dot{r}_{0}(t)\cdot\int_{0}^{t}(\frac{\dot{r}_{0}(t^{ \prime})}{\dot{r}_{0}(t)}-1)\cdot r_{o}(t^{\prime})^{2}\,dt^{\prime}\right]\] (9b) \[\nu := \frac{\lambda_{\gamma}\cdot n_{p}\cdot e\cdot G}{8\cdot\pi\cdot \varepsilon_{0}\cdot V^{2}}\cdot\frac{b^{2}\cdot ln\frac{b}{a}}{\mu\cdot p} \tag{9c}\]

\(a:\) wire diameter \(b:\) inner tube diameter \(V:\) anode wire potential \(\lambda_{\gamma}:\) count rate per cm tube length \(n_{p}:\) primary electrons per \(\gamma\)-event \(r_{0}(t):\) rt-relation without \(\gamma\)-background.

Equations (9a) to (9c) were developed by M. Aleksa. Please refer to [11] for details. Using the resulting rt-relation as starting point, the autocalibration procedure converged within a few iterations. All rt-relation calibration was carried out with the corresponding task in the software package CALIB [12] version 4, release 2 (with small modifications). The CALIB pattern recognition and track fitting algorithms were also used when analysing resolution and efficiency.

Figure 14: Maximum drift time \(t_{max}\) versus background rate. \(t_{max}\) shows a linear decrease with rate. For maximum radiation levels expected at Atlas (500 Hz/cm\({}^{2}\)) \(t_{max}\) the change in drift time is \(\approx 30\) ns.

Bundle results: Maximum drift time analysis with emphasis on potential serial gas system effects

The aim of the 2002 bundle beam test was to evaluate possible effects of the serial gas distribution system on the MDT performance. Such effects can be studied in a simple and effective way by comparing the maximum drift time \(t_{max}\) among the 6 tubes in series at different levels of background radiation.

The first step of the analysis was to study data taken with the \(\gamma\)-source switched off and in nominal conditions of gas parameters, HV and discriminator threshold. Consecutive runs with the source off were grouped together for the analysis.

Unfortunately, the bundle showed an unexpected behaviour during the data taking, with its maximum drift time changing by 10-20 ns from one set of runs with source off to the next (_i.e._ on a time basis of a few hours). In the offline analysis, the drift time was corrected for variations of the chamber temperature according to [13] and of the atmospheric pressure, but these corrections could not account for the observed change in \(t_{max}\).

The setup was closely inspected, but no viable explanation has been found:

* the gas was supplied by the same premixed battery used for the BIS, so the gas composition was the same for the two chambers;
* the calibration of the relative pressure controller and of the module supplying the high voltage to the bundle was checked;
* since the bundle gas system showed a considerable leak, there was some concern about the amount of water inside it; no water analyzer was installed on the bundle gas line during the beam period, so the water contamination was measured only afterwards in an appropriate setup. The water content measured was of the order of 50 ppm at the same gas flow.

It is evident that a quantitative analysis of a serial gas distribution effect on \(t_{max}\) is very difficult in this situation. However, the variation of the drift time was coherent for all the bundle tubes: the spread in \(t_{max}\) amongst the bundle tubes in any given run was of the order of 1-2 ns. This allowed us to study qualitatively the behaviour of the maximum drift time as a function of the tube position in the series.

### Analysis strategy

The method to evaluate \(t_{max}\) consists in fitting the raw time spectrum of each tube in order to extract the rising edge \(t_{0}\) and the falling edge \(t_{f}\). Several fit options have been studied in order to establish the most suitable procedure (Section 6.2).

As explained in Section 5, fitting the raw time spectrum might become very difficult when the photon background increases. A method to "clean" the bundle time spectra using the BIS chamber as an external tracker was developed (Section 6.4).

### Fitting method

The effect of different fitting methods on the evaluation of the maximum drift time was studied on the time spectra of the BIS chamber.

The first method uses a 6 parameters function to fit the whole TDC spectrum

\[\mathrm{A}+\frac{\mathrm{B}\times\left(1+\mathrm{C}\cdot e^{-\frac{x-E}{\mathrm{D} }}\right)}{\left(1+e^{\frac{x+E}{\mathrm{7.9438}}}\right)\times\left(1+e^{\frac{x -E}{\mathrm{5.}}}\right)}, \tag{10}\]

where A,...,F are the 6 free parameters and the \(kT\) values of the two Fermi-Dirac functions used are kept to a fixed value. This method is unfortunately rather sensitive to the MINUIT options used for fitting, as shown in Figure 15.

Figure 16: Example of a global fit of the TDC spectrum performed with the 8 parameters function obtained leaving as free parameters the \(kT\) values of the Fermi-Dirac in 10.

Figure 15: Example of a global fit of the TDC spectrum performed with the 6 parameters function 10. The same spectrum is fitted with two different MINUIT options: on the left, the fit is done using the standard \(\chi^{2}\) option; on the right, the fit is performed in two consecutive steps, first using the bounded fit option and the using the logarithmic likelihood. It is evident that the values of \(t_{0}\) and \(t_{f}\) obtained from the fit depend on the options used.

In order to have a better stability of the fit, the \(kT\) parameters of the Fermi-Dirac functions in Equation (10) can be left as free parameters. The \(\chi^{2}/ndf\) is greatly improved and the \(t_{0}\) and \(t_{f}\) values are indeed independent from the fitting options. An example of a time spectrum fitted with this 8 parameters function is shown in Figure 16.

Figure 17: Example of a fit of the leading edge of the TDC spectrum using a Fermi-Dirac function with \(kT\) as free parameters plus a constant to describe the background.

Figure 18: Example of a fit of the trailing edge of the TDC spectrum using a Fermi-Dirac function with \(kT\) as free parameters plus a constant to describe the background.

The third method consists in performing a separate fit of the leading and trailing edges of the TDC spectrum, using a Fermi-Dirac function with \(kT\) as free parameters plus a constant to describe the background (see Figures 17 and 18). An important issue for this procedure is whether there is a dependence on the width of the region where the fit is performed. It is evident that the definition of the upper bound for the fitting region is critical for \(t_{0}\) evaluation, while the lower bound is critical for \(t_{f}\). Tables 1 and 2) demonstrate that for both the rising edge and the falling edge there is a wide interval of stability of the fit, providing that the spectrum is regular and with enough statistics.

The difference between the \(t_{0}\) obtained from the global 8-parameters function and from the rising edge fit is shown in Figure 19 for the tubes of the first BIS multilayer illuminated by the X5 beam spot. A small bias is evident in the plot. Averaging the \(t_{0}\) values of both BIS multilayers over several runs, the 8-parameters fit is systematically overestimating \(t_{0}\) of about 1.6 ns with respect to the fit of the rising edge.

The comparison of the \(t_{f}\) values obtained with the two methods is presented in Figure 20.

Figure 19: Difference between the \(t_{0}\) values obtained from the global 8-parameters function and from the rising edge fit. The \(t_{0}\) from the global fit is systematically higher by about 1.6 ns.

Figure 20: Difference between the \(t_{f}\) values obtained from the global 8-parameters function and from the rising edge fit. The \(t_{0}\) from the global fit is systematically smaller by about 2 ns.

In this case, the \(t_{f}\) value obtained from the 8-parameters fit is systematically lower by about 2 ns with respect to the fit of the falling edge.

This systematic bias might become a worry if it changes with the amount of background. In addition, a global fit becomes increasingly difficult when the TDC spectrum is overwhelmed by the photon background. For these reasons, the bundle analysis was carried on using the method of performing separate fits for the rising and falling edges.

### Bundle results in the absence of background

The bundle maximum drift time as a function of the tube position in the series is shown in Figure 21 for each of the three layers. No effect due to the serial gas distribution is present. As a comparison, the \(t_{max}\) distribution for the BIS tubes that are in the same position as the bundle tubes with respect to the beam is also plotted.

Figure 21: Maximum drift time of the bundle (open circles) as a function of the tube position in the series, for each of the three layers connected to HV and gas distribution. The plot has been obtained from data with no background. Tube number 2 in layer 4 is not present in the plot because it has no wire. The value of \(t_{max}\) for tube number 6 in layer 3 could not be calculated since the tube is very noise and out of the beam core (low statistics). For comparison, the \(t_{max}\) distribution for the BIS tubes that are in the same position as the bundle tubes with respect to the beam is also plotted (open squares and stars represent the tubes in multilayer 1 and 2 respectively). The absolute difference in the maximum drift time between the BIS chamber and the bundle is not understood (see Section 6).

### Bundle TDC spectra at high rate

In the presence of a high photon background, leading and trailing edges of the TDC spectrum cannot be easily evaluated (Figure 11). In order to extract the real muon spectrum for the bundle, an analysis method has been developed using the BIS as an external tracker:

1. track segments are reconstructed in the BIS chamber;
2. the track is extrapolated to the bundle, and the corresponding bundle tubes are selected;
3. only hits corresponding to the selected bundle tubes are used to plot the "clean" TDC spectrum.

The ideal implementation of this method would be to perform a full optimised tracking on the BIS chamber and to extrapolate geometrically to the bundle. A simpler algorithm was developed for the 2002 data, with the main purpose of testing the feasibility of such an analysis for future studies. This simplified method only works when the muon tracks are perpendicular to the chambers.

As a first step, tracks in the BIS are reconstructed requesting at least 6 hits on the 8 layers of the chamber, with the additional constraint of no missing hits on the first or second layer. Only events with a single reconstructed track are accepted for the analysis. This selection ensures a clean sample, and rejects about 25% of the total events.

The drift radius \(r\) in each BIS tube is divided into three regions:

* Region 1: \(r<\) 1.5 mm;
* Region 2: 1.5 mm \(r<\) 13.5 mm;
* Region 3: 13.5 mm \(r<\) 15 mm.

Muon tracks in the BIS are then classified according to the regions they traverse in the tubes of the first and second layers, _e.g. track 2-1_ identifies a track that went through Region 2 on the first layer and Region 1 on the second layer. Figure 22 illustrates the classification scheme.

The algorithm is tuned using data taken with the source switched off. For each class of BIS tracks, the corresponding pattern of tubes illuminated in the bundle is identified and the results are coded in a look-up table. The look-up table is then used to select the bundle tubes belonging to the muon track in the presence of photon background.

The comparison between the TDC spectrum before and after the selection is shown in Figure 23 for the case of highest background rate, corresponding to about 500 Hz/cm\({}^{2}\). The level of background is strongly reduced, and the rising and falling edges of the spectrum are clearly visible. However, the algorithm is affecting the shape of the TDC spectrum, that appears depleted of hits in its central region. The depletion is also evident in data with no background, as shown in Figure 24. The relevant issue for the analysis of the serial gas system effect is whether the algorithm is introducing a bias in the \(t_{0}\) and \(t_{f}\) determination. Figure 25 shows that this is not the case, at least for background rates up to 100-200 Hz/cm\({}^{2}\). The case of the highest background rate should be treated separately, using also the unfolding procedure outlined in Section 5.1.

Figure 23: Example of a TDC spectrum before and after the selection procedure outlined in the text, in the case of highest background rate, corresponding to about 500 Hz/cm\({}^{2}\).

Figure 22: The drift radius r in each BIS tube is divided into three regions and muon tracks in the chamber are then classified according to the regions they traverse in the tubes of the first and second layers.

### Bundle results at high rate

The bundle maximum drift time as a function of the tube position in the series is shown in Figure 26 for each of the three layers. The plot refers to data taken with a background

Figure 24: Example of a TDC spectrum before and after the selection procedure outlined in the text, for data with no background. A depletion of hits in the central region of the spectrum is introduced by the selection.

Figure 25: Difference between the \(t_{0}\) (on the left) and \(t_{f}\) (on the right) values obtained from the raw TDC spectra and from the spectra after the selection procedure. Excluding the tubes with low statistics, no bias is introduced on the evaluation of \(t_{0}\) and \(t_{f}\).

rate of about 100 Hz/cm\({}^{2}\) and has been produced fitting the TDC spectra obtained with the selection procedure described above. No \(t_{max}\) value could be determined for tubes 5 and 6 on each layer because they are out of the beam spot, and their spectra have a poor statistics after the selection.

The \(t_{max}\) distribution is exhibiting a clear trend with respect to the tube position, that is even more evident from Figure 27. The variation of the maximum drift time is however compatible with the effect caused by the non uniform irradiation of the chambers. This hypothesis is validated by Figure 28, where the \(t_{max}\) distribution for the BIS chamber is shown for the same background level. The plot shows only the BIS tubes that are in the same position, with respect to the beam, as the bundle tubes. The maximum drift time is varying with the tube position, even though the chamber is equipped with a fully parallel gas system.

Figure 26: Maximum drift time of the bundle (open circles) as a function of the tube position in the series, for each of the three layers connected to HV and gas distribution. The plot has been obtained from data with a background of about 100 Hz/cm\({}^{2}\) and has been produced fitting the TDC spectra obtained with the selection procedure described in the text. The maximum drift time for the last two tubes in the series could not be evaluated since these tubes are out of the beam core and the selection procedure gives an additional reduction of the statistics. The trend in \(t_{max}\) is compatible with the effect caused by the non uniform irradiation of the chambers.

Figure 27: Maximum drift time of the bundle as a function of the tube position in the series, for all the three layers connected to HV and gas distribution. The plot has been obtained from data with a background of about 100 Hz/cm\({}^{2}\) and has been produced fitting the TDC spectra obtained with the selection procedure described in the text.

Figure 28: Maximum drift time distribution for the BIS tubes that are in the same position as the bundle tubes with respect to the beam is also plotted (average on the 2 multilayers). The plot has been obtained from data with a background of about 100 Hz/cm\({}^{2}\). The maximum drift time is varying with the tube position, even though the chamber is equipped with a fully parallel gas system.

BIS results: Resolution

Since no external track information as e.g. from a silicon telescope was available for the BIS data, the same method as for the H8 analysis 2001 was used to obtain the single tube resolution curve from the MDT data itself:

1. Search for hit-patterns belonging to tracks with \(\geq 8\) hits and use events with one identified track only
2. Exclude one tube from the track, fit a straight line to the remaining hits, using an estimated resolution \(\sigma_{i}(r)\),
3. Calculate the residual \(\delta(r_{track})=r_{track}-r_{drift}\) and the fit extrapolation error \(\varepsilon(r_{track})\) for the excluded tube,
4. For 0.5 mm wide slices in \(r\), fit a Gaussian with width \(\sigma_{\delta}\) to the center of the residual-distribution. Calculate the average extrapolation error \(\varepsilon\) in the same slice.
5. Calculate a new estimate for the tube resolution as8 Footnote 8: this is only true if the width of the extrapolation error distribution is negligible. Otherwise the more general relation \(\sigma^{2}=\sigma_{\delta}^{2}-\varepsilon^{2}-Var(\varepsilon)\) must be used.
6. Iterate until \(\sigma_{i+1}=\sigma_{i}\).

### Imposing \(\chi^{2}\)-cuts on the track quality

If the resolution is obtained following the above procedure without using an external reference tracker, particular care needs to be taken when imposing track quality cuts. \(\chi^{2}\)-cuts help to reject tracks which are biased by one or more hits caused by \(\delta\)-electrons or background photons. On the other hand too stringent cut choices can seriously bias the resolution results towards too small values9.

The influence and best choice of \(\chi^{2}\)-cuts on the track fit was investigated with a simple Monte Carlo: random tracks were generated in the BIS geometry as straight lines within a selected angular range. For each tube intersected, the geometric drift radius \(r\) and the corresponding drift time \(t\) was calculated. To each \(r\) a random number \(\sigma(r)\) was added to obtain a "measured" \(r^{l}\). \(\sigma(r)\) followed a Gaussian distribution with mean 0 and a \(r\)-dependent width corresponding to an assumed MDT tube resolution. Photons (and \(\delta\)-electrons) were included into the simulation by throwing a dice on the arrival time (exponential distribution) of the first \(\gamma\)-hit, \(t_{\gamma}\). In case \(t_{\gamma}<t_{true}\), the arrival time of the photon was reconverted into a drift radius and used as \(r^{l}\). A straight line was fitted to the Monte Carlo hits \(r^{l}\) with the help of the same track fitting algorithm used for the experimental data. The MC resolution was calculated according to the iterative procedure described above. The following results were found:

In the case of no radiation background no track quality cuts are needed and no cuts were consequently used in the analysis. It is advantageous to restrict the Gaussian fit to the residual distribution to \(\pm\) 1 standard deviation around 0, so that the influence of outlying large residuals caused by \(\delta\)-electrons is minimised.

For Atlas-like background conditions the situation is different: Figure 29 shows the \(\chi^{2}\) distributions obtained with the toy Monte Carlo for no radiation background and for an average tube count rate due to photons of 250 kHz (500 Hz/cm\({}^{2}\)). For pure muons the spectrum sharply drops off at values around 4, while for the high background simulation an almost flat tail extends towards larger \(\chi^{2}\). By choosing an upper \(\chi^{2}\)-limit corresponding to the "kink" in the distribution shown (logarithmic plot), the resulting resolutions were unbiased, while too loose cuts yielded resolutions which were too large by up to 20 \(\mu\)m. The analysis of the X5 experimental data was therefore performed in 2 steps: first an appropriate cut value was determined from the track \(\chi^{2}\)-distribution; this value was then used as track acceptance criteria in the actual resolution determination.

### Resolution without radiation background

When first determining the resolution, the BIS data showed a significantly worse resolution close to the wire compared to the H8 2001 results (Figure 30, left part). The reason for this

Figure 29: Monte Carlo distribution of track fit \(\chi^{2}\) with and without simulated photon background. The \(\chi^{2}\) values are normalised to the number of degrees of freedom, i.e. 5 in case of a track defined by 7 hits as for the BIS resolution study. In the presence of a radiation background the distribution shows a long, almost flat tail towards large \(\chi^{2}\)-values. The Monte Carlo study showed that for high rate data an appropriate \(\chi^{2}\)-cut definition is at the ”kink” in the shown distribution.

behaviour was traced to a large jitter in the timing of the trigger signal (\(\approx\) 1.8 - 2.2 ns). A bad trigger time resolution causes an additional contribution to the single tube resolution; with the non-linear Ar:CO\({}_{2}\) rt-relation this contribution is largest for small \(r\) (largest \(v_{d\#ift}\)).

Using the information from the LeCroy TDCs 2228 connected to the 3 scintillators forming the beam trigger (section 2.3), it turned out that the bad trigger time resolution was mainly due to events where more than one beam particle and/or noise hits were involved in generating the coincidence signal10. An empirical rejection criteria was used on the TDC 2228 timing results to get rid of such atypical events (Figure 30, right part). After this, the problem of too bad resolutions for small radii disappeared.

Figure 31 shows the resolution obtained with the GIF radioactive source switched off after applying the empirical cut on the trigger timing. The results are consistent for all investigated track incidence angles as well as with the H8 2001 measurements.

Footnote 10: The 3 scintillators used to form the beam trigger unfortunately had dimensions larger than their overlap.

### Resolution in the presence of background radiation

Figure 32 shows the changes to the single tube resolution with increasing photon rate. One observes a deterioration for large radii. The cause for this degradation are the increas

Figure 30: Left: MDT resolution obtained from BIS data without any cut on the trigger timing. For small \(r\) the resolution is significantly worse than the H8 2001 results [14],[15]. Right: contour plot of the relation between the timing of signals from 2 of the 3 beam scintillators (as measured with the TDCs 2228). The distribution shows a pronounced peak (coloured) plus far reaching irregular tails, which are interpreted as events where more than one beam particle and/or noise hits were involved in generating the coincidence trigger signal. If only events with their trigger timing signature in the peak are used for data analysis, the MDT resolution for small \(r\) is reduced to the expected values.

Figure 31: BIS single tube resolution without radiation background. Error bars correspond to the standard deviation calculated from 8 individual layer results. the The right half of the plot shows the resolution curves for different track angles (0\({}^{\circ}\) = tracks perpendicular to the chamber). All curves agree within their errors. The left half shows that the 2002 X5 BIS results agree with measurements at H8 in 2001. This agreement was only reached after imposing cuts on the timing of the scintillator beam trigger signals.

Figure 32: BIS single tube resolution for different levels of photon background. With increasing \(\gamma\)-rate the resolution deteriorates for large drift radii. No deterioration for tracks close to the wire was observed. The stated count rate values are the average over the tubes in the beam region. The range of actually found rates due to the non-uniform irradiation is shown in brackets. All resolution studies for high rate data were performed with tracks perpendicular to the chamber.

ing fluctuations in the space charge created by background events and the consequently growing variations in the electric drift field. Possible additional contributions are a gain reduction due to space charge and a shift of the baseline for the unipolar 10k prototype electronics.

## 8 BIS results: Efficiency

Two different definitions of efficiency will be used in the following. The **hit efficiency** is the probability that for a muon track crossing the tube at a radius \(r\) the MDT registers a hit irrespective of the measured drift time. For a MDT the hit efficiency is expected to be 1, except for tracks very close to the tube wall.

Since for track reconstruction it is not only important to find any hit, but a hit with "good" position information, a second definition is used. The \(\boldsymbol{3}\sigma\)-**efficiency** is the probability that for a muon track crossing the tube at a radius \(r\) the drift radius \(r_{\#ift}\), as reconstructed from the drift time \(t_{drift}\), does not differ from \(r\) by more than 3 times the single tube resolution. The \(3\sigma\)-efficiency of a MDT is less than 1 due to the fact that even without any radiation background there is a certain probability for a muon hit to be masked by an earlier \(\delta\)-electron signal.

Efficiencies were analysed for the 2 innermost tube layers of the BIS chamber, where the track fit extrapolation error is smallest. The proper rt-relation and resolution-curve were used for each investigated photon rate. The following procedure was used:

1. Search for tracks over both BIS multilayers, for which at most a hit in one of the innermost layers is missing.
2. Exclude the innermost tubes from the track, fit a straight line to the remaining hits.
3. Interpolate the track to the excluded MDTs, calculate its distance \(d\) from the tube centers.
4. Check whether the tubes under study registered any hits and if so calculate their residual.
5. Calculate the hit efficiency as \[\varepsilon_{hit}(r)=\frac{\#(\textit{events with }\geq 1\ \textit{hit and }d=r)}{\#(\textit{events with }d=r)}\,.\] (12)
6. Calculate the \(3\sigma\)-efficiency as \[\varepsilon_{3\sigma}(r)=\frac{\#(\textit{events with }|r_{drift}-d|\leq 3\cdot\sqrt{\sigma(r)^{2}+ extrapol.err.^{2}}\textit{and }d=r)}{\#(\textit{events with }d=r)}\,.\] (13)

For \(3\sigma\)-efficiency determination, events were further classified into 2 categories depending on whether the tube under study showed a previous hit within \(500\,\mathrm{ns}\) of the start of the AMT match window (AMT mask flag set) or not.

The same Monte Carlo as for the resolution analysis was used to study the impact of \(\chi^{2}\)-cuts on the track fit and the precision of the described method in the case of high background data. An upper limit of \(0.01\) (\(1\%\)) was found for the potential systematic error introduced into the \(3\sigma\)-efficiencies obtained by imposing cuts as explained in section 7.1 on the track quality.

### Hit efficiency

Figure 33 shows the BIS hit efficiency results for different background conditions. The hit efficiency is very close to 1 for all radii except very close to the tube wall. A close inspection of the data shows a slight decrease in efficiency near the wire with increasing photon rate. One idea to explain such behaviour is the creation of signals with very high amplitude for a small fraction of photons [9]. Such signals can in principle stay above the discriminator threshold for a significant part of the AMT match window of 1 \(\mu\)s and thus prevent the front end electronics from registering a muon hit. To check this hypothesis the hit efficiencies were re-determined for events with no hit in the 500 ns preceding the AMT match window only. The slight decrease in efficiency was still present in this case, which makes the suggested explanation less likely. An alternative cause could be an exceptional large and long lasting baseline shift caused by a small percentage of background photons leading to a significantly higher effective threshold for some events.

### 3\(\sigma\)-efficiency

Figure 34 shows the BIS 3\(\sigma\)-efficiency results. For all \(r\) values the efficiency drops by approximately 10% from an environment with no background to the maximum investigated photon rate of 200 kHz/tube. In section 9 it will be shown that the experimental efficiency curves correspond well to what is predicted from simulation.

Figure 35 shows the residual \(d_{track}-r_{df;left}\) in relation to the track distance \(d\) from the tube center for events which were classified as "3\(\sigma\)-inefficient". One can clearly see that the absolute majority of such events have a positive residual, meaning that the real muon

Figure 33: BIS hit efficiency for different background rates. The hit efficiency is as expected very close to 1 except for tracks very close to the tube wall. A slight decrease in hit efficiency can be observed close to the wire for increasing photon rates. The cause for this behaviour is not fully understood.

hit was masked by an earlier \(\delta\)-electron or photon signal. The absence of hits in the lower half of the plot (negative residual) is a direct prove that no first threshold crossings were lost by the frontend electronics.

## 9 Simulation

### Changes to \(t_{\mathit{max}}\) with rate

The change in maximum drift time with background rate as shown in Figure 14 is caused by space charge which changes the electric drift field \(E(r)\). If one assumes a time-independent positive ion density \(\rho_{\mathit{ion}}\), charge conservation leads to the relation

\[\rho_{\mathit{ion}}(r)\sim\frac{\dot{R}_{\mathit{ion}}}{\mu\cdot r\cdot E(r)} \tag{14}\]

with \(\mu:\) ion mobility, \(\dot{R}_{\mathit{ion}}:\) ion production rate.

If one assumes that \(E(r)\) in the presence of space charge deviates only slightly from the standard \(1/r\)-behaviour, then Equation (14) reduces to a constant. This approach was taken by G. Scherberger in describing the modified electric field [1]; one finally arrives at

Figure 34: BIS \(3\sigma\)-efficiency for different background rates. The \(3\sigma\)-efficiency decreases with increasing drift radius \(r\) since the probability for a muon hit to be masked by an earlier \(\gamma\)-hit grows with the drift time. The average efficiency is reduced from \(\approx 95\%\) in case of no radiation-background to \(\approx 85\%\) for the highest photon flux investigated. It should be noted that the decrease in \(3\sigma\)-efficiency depends on the total tube count rate rather than on the rate per cm\({}^{2}\) as the resolution.

the expression

\[E_{1}(r)=\frac{V-\overbrace{\frac{\rho_{ion}}{4\varepsilon_{0}}(b^{2}-a^{2})}}{ ln\frac{b}{a}}\cdot\frac{1}{r}+\frac{\rho_{ion}}{2\varepsilon_{0}}\cdot r \tag{15}\]

with \(a:\) wire diameter, \(b:\) inner tube diameter, \(V:\) anode wire potential.

The ion density \(\rho_{ion}\) is calculated from the number of primary electrons, gas gain \(G\) and ion drift time to the cathode. Since the ion drift time itself depends on the electric field, the calculation is solved by iteration.

A different method was used by M. Aleksa et al. [2]: making use of Gauss' law, \(\nabla\cdot E=\rho/\varepsilon_{0}\), Equation (14) can be transformed into the differential equation

\[E(r)^{2}+r\cdot E(r)\cdot\frac{dE}{dr}=c\,, \tag{16}\]

where the constant \(c\) is a function of the gas gain, primary ionisation per photon and background rate. Equation (16) can be solved and results in an electric field

\[E_{2}(r)=\sqrt{c}\cdot\frac{k}{r}\cdot\sqrt{1+\frac{r^{2}}{k^{2}}}\,, \tag{17}\]

with the constant \(k\) defined by the boundary condition \(\int_{a}^{b}E(r)dr=V\).

Building on the given models for the modified electric field, the software package GARFIELD [16], version 7.08, has been utilised to simulate the maximum electron drift time.

Figure 35: Residual plot for 200.6 kHz average photon count rate. Only hits which are ”\(3\sigma\)-inefficient” are plotted. The absence of entries on the lower half proves that no problems with missed first hits were encountered.

The parameters used in the simulation are summarised in table 3. The maximum drift time was defined as the average time the 25th electron from a track at \(r=14.5\) mm needed to reach the wire (no signal generation taken into account).

Figure 36 shows the simulation results in comparison to the experimental data; it should

Figure 36: Simulation results for the change in \(t_{max}\) with background rate due to space charge effects. Both investigated models for the modified electric field yield almost identical drift times. When comparing the simulation to the experimental data one sees that the qualitative behaviour is reproduced correctly, but that the slope is too shallow. This is possibly due to the large error of 20% on the average number \(\tilde{N}_{p.e.}\) of primary electrons created per background event (Equation (3)) needed as input to the simulation.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|l|r|} \hline gas & Ar:CO\({}_{2}\) = 93:7, \\  & no water11 \\ \hline pressure & 3 bar (abs.) \\ temperature & 20\({}^{o}\)C \\ \hline wire diameter & 50 \(\mu\)m \\ inner tube radius & 14.585 mm \\ \hline anode wire potential & 3080 V \\ \hline gas gain & \(2\cdot 10^{4}\) \\ \hline primary electrons created & 1285, \\ per photon, \(\tilde{N}_{p.e.}\) & see Equation (3) \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 3: Garfield parameters used for \(t_{max}\) simulation first be noted that both models for the electric field produce almost identical predictions. From the simulation one expects a linear decrease in \(t_{max}\) with increasing background rate, as indeed confirmed by the data. The fact that the observed reduction in the maximum drift time is less steep than expected can be explained by the large uncertainty of 20% on the number of primary electrons created on average per photon event (table 3), which is needed as input parameter to the simulation.

### Gain drop

From Equation 15 it can be seen that close to the wire the space charge from drifting ions effectively reduces the anode wire potential \(V\) by an amount \(\delta V\). The same can be shown to be the case for the E-field \(E_{2}\) in Equation (17) by Taylor expansion. Since the gas amplification depends strongly on the applied anode high voltage, one expects a reduction in the gas gain \(G\) with increasing background rate. Using Diethorn's formula to relate the change in voltage, \(\delta V\), to a change in \(G\), the gain drop can be predicted. Figure 37 shows the simulation results for Ar:CO\({}_{2}\) and a nominal gas gain of \(2\cdot 10^{4}\). For the highest rates expected at Atlas a gain reduction of at maximum 10% has to be envisioned.

Since the BIS DAQ included a charge integrating ADC on every third MDT (section 2.2), the rate-induced drop in gas gain in principle could be measured. In reality this turned out to be impossible: the ADC spectra for high photon background showed a distinct smearing towards smaller values rather than a shift as expected from a reduced gas amplification (Figure 38). The phenomenon was interpreted as being caused by large base line fluctuations of the front end electronics, a theory supported by the shape of signals observed on an oscilloscope and by a similar smearing effect observed in the ADC pedestal distributions.

Figure 37: Simulation of expected gain drop with background rate. For maximum Atlas rates (incl. the safety factor 5) a gain reduction of \(\approx 10\%\) has to be envisioned.

### Resolution degradation with rate

In section 9.1 a time-independent model of the electric drift field in the presence of a large background was presented. While the steady state model is adequate to simulate the changes in the maximum drift time, field fluctuations are the dominant contribution to the resolution degradation with rate for a non-linear drift gas like Ar:CO\({}_{2}\) and thus must be included in the simulation. Additional effects are the gain drop discussed in section 9.2, a possible baseline shift and finally fluctuations of the baseline. It should be noted that the last two contributions depend on the total tube count rate rather than on the rate per length as do effects originating from space charge.

All contributions mentioned above except for the field fluctuations lead to a worse resolution mainly for small radii due to an effective higher (or varying) threshold. Since such a behaviour was not seen in the experimental data, one can conclude that their influence is small12.

Footnote 12: For the gain drop this agrees with a detailed simulation presented in [11]. The baseline shift on the other hand has been measured for the BIS chamber with the help of the Camac ADCs on the analogue output; an upper limit of 3 primary electrons was estimated from the measurement, which produces effects below 5 \(\mu\)m in a GARFIELD simulation.

Figure 38: Muon hit integrated pulse charge for different background rates. The measurement was done with the Camac ADCs connected to the analogue output of every 3rd mezzanine channel. An integration gate of 1 \(\mu\)s was used. Muon hits were identified from pattern recognition and track reconstruction. For high background rates the spectrum is smeared towards lower charges which can be explained by large baseline fluctuations (rather than a baseline shift) of the unipolar front end electronics. The effect of baseline fluctuation makes it impossible to measure the expected gain drop.

### Modelling field fluctuations

Two different methods have been used in the past to incorporate fluctuations of the drift field into the simulation. G. Scherberger [1] starts with a detailed numerical analysis of the spatial movement of the ion cloud produced by a single 1-hit event with time. After the shape and position of an ion cloud produced at time \(t_{1}\) is known for all \(t>t_{1}\) from this preparatory study, a Monte Carlo method is used: for a muon at time \(t_{\mu}\) the time of the last (\(t_{-1}\)), last but one (\(t_{-2}\)), last but two (\(t_{-3}\)),.... gas amplification processes is generated from exponential distributions until \(t_{\mu}-t_{(-i)}\) is larger than the maximum ion drift time of approximately 4 ms. For each such "bygone" event, the position and shape of the ion cloud at time \(t_{\mu}\) is calculated. The ion clouds are then approximated by a number of point charges and their electric field superimposed to the standard \(1/r\)-field. As a final step the drift of electrons created at a distance from the wire corresponding to the muon track drift radius in the now "frozen" field configuration (\(v_{ions}\ll v_{e}\)) is studied by numerically integrating drift velocities \(v_{e}(E)\) calculated beforehand with GARFIELD. A simpler approach has been chosen by M. Aleksa [2], keeping the radial-symmetric, steady state model for the electric field introduced in section 9.1 but allowing the total amount of space charge (i.e. the constant \(c\) in Equation (16)) to vary. For this the assumption was made that the electric field a drifting electron'sees' is not influenced by far away ions but only by ions in a slice of thickness \(\Delta x\) in wire direction. \(\Delta x\) was chosen as 1 cm. The **average number of ion clouds per 1 cm** was then taken as a random number following a Poisson-distribution with mean

\[\lambda_{Poisson}=(Rate\ per\,\Delta x)\,\cdot\,(max.ion\ drift\ time)\,.\]

For the maximum expected Atlas rate of 1500 Hz/cm\({}^{2}\)\(\lambda_{Poisson}\) is around 5.

There are several critical points in this model:

* While it is true that the contribution of ions far 'down' the wire to the field a drifting electron actually sees is negligible, the width \(\Delta x\) of the region in which ions do have an influence is radius dependent (\(r\) small \(\rightarrow\)\(\Delta x\) small).
* Simulations with a space charge ring show that the electron drift time for a given radius depends not only on the total amount of ions, but also on their position. In the method described this additional contribution to field and consequently drift time fluctuations is suppressed.
* For photons which interact by Compton-scattering, the deposited energy and thus the created space charge do not have fixed values. Fluctuations in the number of created ions per \(\gamma\)-hit increase the field variations, but are not taken into account in the model.

Nevertheless this second model was used in the simulations presented in this note. The reason for this is that the detailed simulation of the spatial movement of ion clouds as performed by G. Scherberger only makes sense if the initial charge distribution after the ionisation of the gas by a particle is known. For the experimental studies the simulation method was developed for, this was the case: the measurements summarised in [1] were performed with CERN's high intensity muon beam M2 (now serving the COMPASS experiment). Space charge effects were caused by the high **muon** rate; the distribution of primary electrons created by ionisation along the track could rather easily be parametrised from the beam profile.

For the X5/GIF measurements presented in this note (and also for the studies in [2]) the situation was different since the high rate environment was created by an intense **photon** background. The muon beam itself was 'weak'. Since photons at GIF interact with a MDT mainly by Compton-scattering, which does not give a unique ionisation pattern, a parametrization of the initial space charge created in \(\gamma\)-interactions is difficult.

Figure 39 shows the simulation results for the simple model and a background rate of 393.3 Hz/cm\({}^{2}\). Only field fluctuations have been simulated; their contribution to the resolution was then added quadratically to the experimental resolution values in case of no background. The model correctly predicts a loss in resolution for large radii only, as is indeed found from the experimental data. The quantitative agreement with the experimental data is less good, field fluctuations in reality seem to be larger than the ones obtained with the model used13.

Footnote 13: This behaviour is different from the results presented in [2], where data and simulation results were in [18].

### \(3\sigma-\)efficiency with no radiation background present

In the absence of any noise hits and with no photon background present the degradation of \(3\sigma\)-efficiency with increasing drift radius \(r\) is caused purely by \(\delta\)-electrons produced either in the tube wall or the drift gas. A method to simulate expected \(n\cdot\sigma\)-efficiencies (typical \(n=3\) or \(5\)) with the help of GEANT is described in [17]. The simulation calculations presented here followed the same recipe but were adjusted for the exact MDT dimensions and operating gas; they were carried out by S. Baranov (Uni Freiburg) using GEANT3 [18].

Figure 39: Resolution degradation due to field fluctuations. The additional contribution to the single tube resolution due to field fluctuations was simulated according to the simple model developed in [2] and described in the text. Comparison to the experimental results from section 7.3 shows a qualitative agreement (degraded resolution for large radii only), but a too small value for the predicted loss in resolution.

Figure 40: GEANT3 simulation results for 3\(\sigma\)-efficiencies (top) and 5\(\sigma\)-efficiencies (bottom) in the case of no photon background. One clearly sees that the Monte Carlo results depend on the energy cut off value to which \(\delta\)-electrons are traced. The agreement of the simulation done with an energy cut off of 4 keV and the experimental results is on the 0.5-1% level, compared to an estimated uncertainty of 1% in the experimental data alone.

The simulation results together with the efficiency curve obtained from the X5 data are shown in Figure 40 for both \(3\sigma\) and \(5\sigma\) efficiency definitions. The simulation results are dependent on the lower energy cut-off used for tracing the produced \(\delta\)-electrons in GEANT3. This is understandable if one takes into account that an electron energy of 10 keV in argon at 3 bar pressure corresponds to a range of approximately 900 \(\mu\)m [19], which is far larger than the tube resolution. Using a 10 keV cut-off some MDT hits with an associated \(\delta\)-electron will be classified wrongly as "efficient" only because the electron was not traced far enough. In this case the calculated residual stays below the \(3\sigma\) (\(5\sigma\)) threshold in the simulation, but may not do so in reality. After this was realised, the energy cut-off was reduced to a more appropriate value of 4 keV.

The simulation results further reproduce the data better for a \(5\sigma\) than for a \(3\sigma\) efficiency definition. One possible explanation for this is that the Monte Carlo does not take into account the intrinsic tube resolution. In total it can be said that the simulation predicts the same qualitative behaviour as found experimentally; in addition the quantitative agreement is on the level of 0.005-0.01 which is rather good compared to the estimated uncertainty of 0.01 (1%) in the experimental results.

### \(3\sigma\)-efficiency for high background rates

While predicting inefficiencies due to \(\delta\)-electrons requires a full physics simulation of the interaction between the incident muons and the tubes and operating gas, the additional loss of efficiency in the presence of background radiation is a pure stochastic process in which a muon hit is "hidden" by an earlier background hit. If \(\varepsilon_{\delta}\) is the **inefficiency** due to \(\delta\)-electrons and \(\varepsilon_{\gamma}\) the **inefficiency** due to a photon masking the actual muon hit, then by simple probability theory the overall inefficiency \(\varepsilon\) is

\[1-\varepsilon=\varepsilon=\varepsilon_{\delta}+\varepsilon_{\gamma}- \varepsilon_{\delta}\cdot\varepsilon_{\gamma}\,. \tag{18}\]

As already pointed out in section 5.1 there exists a third mechanism in addition to \(\delta\)-electrons and \(\gamma\)-hits by which a true muon hit can be masked, namely by secondary threshold crossings of a photon event occurring shortly before the start of the AMT match window (Figure 41). If the inefficiency due to such multiple threshold crossings is \(\varepsilon_{m}\), Equation (18) becomes

\[\varepsilon=\varepsilon_{\delta}+\varepsilon_{\gamma}+\varepsilon_{m}- \varepsilon_{\delta}\cdot\varepsilon_{\gamma}\ -\varepsilon_{\delta}\cdot\varepsilon_{m}- \varepsilon_{\gamma}\cdot\varepsilon_{m}+\varepsilon_{\delta}\cdot \varepsilon_{\gamma}\cdot\varepsilon_{m}\,. \tag{19}\]

That the additional inefficiency contribution \(\varepsilon_{m}\) is indeed non-negligible can be seen from Figure 42 where the experimentally obtained \(3\sigma\)-efficiency is shown both for all hits and for hits which were not preceded by a hit within 500 ns before the start of the AMT match window.

For the simulation of the change in \(3\sigma\)-efficiency with rate, the inefficiency \(\varepsilon_{\delta}(r)\) due to \(\delta\)-electrons was taken as the experimentally obtained curve for no radiation background (Figure 34). The inefficiency \(\varepsilon_{\gamma}(r)\) due to photons can be calculated from the average photon count rate \(R_{\gamma}\) as

\[\varepsilon_{\gamma}(r)=1-e^{-\lambda}\quad\text{with} \tag{20}\]

\[\lambda=(t_{d^{\prime}ift}(r-3\cdot\sigma(r))+t_{0})\cdot R_{\gamma}\,. \tag{21}\]

\(t_{d^{\prime}ift}\) is the drift time corresponding to a radius of \(r-3\cdot\sigma(r))\), \(\sigma\) is the single tube resolution and \(t_{0}\) is the leading edge of the TDC spectrum with respect to the start of the Figure 41: Inefficiencies introduced by secondary threshold crossings: the photon event shown in green and occurring shortly before the start of the AMT match window "spills over" into the match window and mask the later muon hit (pink). The consequence is an additional contribution to the \(3\sigma\)-inefficiency.

Figure 42: Experimental \(3\sigma\) efficiency with and without the contributions of secondary threshold crossings for a photon rate of \(400\,Hz/cm^{2}\). To eliminate the effect of secondary threshold crossings only hits for which the AMT mask flag was not set (i.e. hits which were not preceded by any hit in the 500 ns before the start of the AMT match window) were selected.

AMT match window, \(t_{start}\). \(\lambda\) can be interpreted as the average number of photon hits in the time interval \([t_{start},t_{drift}]\).

The most complicated part in the simulation is to obtain an estimate for \(\varepsilon_{m}\). This was done using Monte Carlo techniques to simulate one million events per radius point in the following way:

1. From a calibration data run get the probability distribution for the number of threshold crossings for photon events, \(P_{n}\) (Figure 43).
2. From the same data get the conditional probability distributions \(P(t_{k}|n)\), \(k\leq n\) for the arrival time of the \(k\)-th threshold crossing if the total number of threshold crossings was \(n\) (Figure 44).
3. For the \(t_{max}\approx 700\,\mathrm{ns}\) long interval \([t_{start}-700\,\mathrm{ns},t_{start}]\) throw a dice on the number of photon events (Poisson-distribution).
4. For each such event determine its time in the interval \([t_{start}-700\,\mathrm{ns},t_{start}]\) from a uniform distribution.
5. For each photon event determine the number of threshold crossings \(n\) as a random number drawn from the \(P_{n}\) distribution.
6. For each of the \(n\) threshold crossings get its timing as a random number following the \(P(t_{k}|n)\) distribution introduced above.
7. Check if at least one of the threshold crossings lies in the interval \([0,t(r-3\sigma(r))]\); if so, count the event as inefficient.

Figure 43: Probability \(P_{n}\) distribution for the number of threshold crossings for a photon event with the ASD-lite electronics. \(P_{n}\) is needed when simulating inefficiencies due to secondary multiple threshold crossings of photon events outside the actual AMT match window.

Figure 44: Distributions \(P(t_{k}|n)\) for the timing of the \(k\)-th threshold crossing relative to the first one for a photon event with in total \(n\) threshold crossings. One can see that for fixed n the distributions are shifted to later times with increasing \(k\); on the other hand the distributions are shifted towards earlier times for fixed \(k\) and increasing n.

Figure 45 shows the \(3\sigma\)-efficiency curves calculated according to this method for different background rates. The agreement with the experimental data is good for photon rates of 100.8 Hz/cm\({}^{2}\) and 230.6 Hz/cm\({}^{2}\); it is less good for the highest investigated average photon flux of 393.6 Hz/cm\({}^{2}\), where the measured efficiency is higher than the expected one. The most likely reason for this behaviour is a slightly wrong assumed photon count rate. The definition of the exact count rate to be used in the simulation is problematic due to the non-uniformity in the \(\gamma\)-background described in section 3.3, together with the fact that the experimental efficiency curves are averaged over 17 tubes for better statistics.

Overall it can be said that the simulation results confirm the statement made in section 8 that there is no evidence for any lost hits; the aim of a validation of the front end electronics was thus reached.

## 10 Summary and Conclusions

In the 2002 test beam run at X5/GIF with BIS 'Beatrice' it was for the first time possible to operate a production scale final Atlas chamber under LHC equivalent conditions. Changes in the drift properties, resolution and efficiency with background rate were studied and correspond well to simulation results. No ununderstood behaviour was observed.

The results presented in this note also show that an analysis of high rate data is possible without the use of an external reference tracker or silicon telescope during the measure

Figure 45: \(3\sigma\)-efficiency obtained with the simulation procedure described in the text. The agreement with the experimental data is good for photon rates of 100.8 Hz/cm\({}^{2}\) and 230.6 Hz/cm\({}^{2}\); it is less good for the highest investigated average photon flux of 393.6 Hz/cm\({}^{2}\).

ments, but requires care. The goal of validating the Atlas front end electronics was reached; no evidence of missed hits was found. The remaining problem of occasional DAQ hang ups is thought to be solved for the final version of the AMT.

For future measurements at X5/GIF it is advisable to pay attention to the uniformity of the photon flux from the beginning. The non-uniform \(\gamma\)-rates during the 2002 run are one of the main limitations in the analyses presented, in particular for what concerns the study of serial gas system effects. The analysis of the bundle data showed a clear dependence of the maximum drift time on the tube position in the series, in the presence of high background. However, it could not be excluded that this effect is purely due to the non-uniform rate distribution. For this reason, a beam test of a BIL chamber equipped with serial gas system will be performed in July 2003.
