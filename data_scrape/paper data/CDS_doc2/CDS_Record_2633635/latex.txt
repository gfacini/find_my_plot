The expected sensitivity of a search for decays of the Higgs boson into charm quarks is estimated for the ATLAS detector at the HL-LHC, by extrapolating the results obtained using a dataset with an integrated luminosity of \(36.1\leavevmode\nobreak\ \mathrm{fb}^{-1}\) at \(\sqrt{s}=13\leavevmode\nobreak\ \mathrm{TeV}\). Associated production of Higgs and \(Z\) bosons is targeted, where the \(Z\) bosons decay to electrons or muons. Assuming an integrated luminosity of \(3000\leavevmode\nobreak\ \mathrm{fb}^{-1}\) of \(pp\) collision data at \(\sqrt{s}=14\leavevmode\nobreak\ \mathrm{TeV}\), an expected upper limit at the 95% confidence level of 6.3 times the Standard Model expectation for \(\sigma(pp\to ZH)\times\mathcal{B}(H\to c\bar{c})\) is estimated, in the absence of systematic uncertainties. The impact of systematic uncertainties and possible improvements in the flavour tagging performance on the sensitivity are estimated.

## 1 Introduction

With a Standard Model (SM) branching ratio of 2.9% [1], decays of the Higgs boson to charm (\(c\)) quarks represent the fermionic decay mode with the largest branching ratio for which no experimental evidence exists. This decay mode also represents a promising window through which to probe the Yukawa couplings of the Higgs boson to the second generation quarks. Furthermore, given that the branching ratio for Higgs decays to first and second generation quarks is small in the SM, potential new physics affecting this sector could lead to notable modifications [2].

Measurements of the Yukawa couplings of the Higgs boson to second generation quarks are challenging at hadron colliders due to the large hadronic backgrounds, small branching ratios, and challenging jet flavour identification. However, exclusive searches for rare inclusive decays of the Higgs boson to \(J/\psi\gamma\)[3], \(\rho\gamma\), and \(\phi\gamma\)[4] final states have been performed by the ATLAS Collaboration. Inclusive searches for decays of the Higgs boson into \(c\) quarks are possible through its associated production with a vector boson, which provides a distinct final state and efficient trigger strategy. Recently, an inclusive Run 2 search based on a \(\sqrt{s}=13\,\mathrm{TeV}\)\(pp\) collision dataset corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 36.1 \(\mathrm{fb}^{-1}\) collected by the ATLAS experiment [5] set a 95% CL\({}_{s}\)[6; 7] upper limit on \(\sigma(pp\to ZH)\times\mathcal{B}(H\to c\bar{c})\) of 2.7 pb (110 times the SM expectation) [8].

This note describes the prospects for such an inclusive search at the upgraded HL-LHC ATLAS detector [9; 10], by extrapolating from the signal and background simulation used in the Run 2 analysis [8], to the expected integrated luminosity of 3000 \(\mathrm{fb}^{-1}\). The analysis strategy closely follows the Run 2 analysis [8], with any differences stated explicitly. However, in a HL-LHC scenario, both the ATLAS detector and the analysis strategy are expected to change significantly from the Run 2 analysis and it is difficult to make reliable predictions for the systematic uncertainties relevant to the HL-LHC analysis. As such, the main result of this study is a statistical projection of the limit, neglecting possible systematic uncertainties. Where possible, the impact of typical sources of systematic uncertainty on the limit are estimated, based on their Run 2 values. Finally, the effect of expected improvements in the ATLAS flavour tagging performance on the sensitivity of the analysis is explored.

## 2 Methods

This search targets the production of a Higgs boson in association with a \(Z\) boson, in a final state where the \(Z\) boson decays to a pair of oppositely charged electrons or muons and the Higgs boson decays to a pair of \(c\) quarks. The selection considered for the HL-LHC is almost identical to the Run 2 analysis [8], with single lepton triggers used to collect events, followed by \(Z\) and Higgs boson candidates being formed from pairs of leptons and one or two \(c\)-tagged jets, respectively.

The sensitivity of the search was quantified using a profile likelihood fit (referred to as the fit) to the invariant mass distributions (10 GeV bins between 50 and 200 GeV) of the two highest \(p_{T}\) jets (\(m_{c\bar{c}}\)), in four event categories. These four event categories are defined as having either 1 or 2 of the Higgs boson candidate jets \(c\)-tagged, and \(75<p_{T}^{Z}<150\) GeV or \(p_{T}^{Z}>150\) GeV, where \(p_{T}^{Z}\) denotes the transverse momentum of the \(Z\) boson candidate. The dominant background to this search is \(Z+\mathrm{jets}\), with smaller contributions arising from diboson (\(ZZ\), \(ZW\)), \(t\bar{t}\), and \(ZH(b\bar{b})\) production.

The higher expected signal yield in the HL-LHC scenario is exploited by considering a \(c\)-jet tagging working point with a greater \(b\)- and light-flavour jet rejection than that used by the Run 2 analysis.

The tighter working point exhibits efficiencies of 18%, 5% and 0.5% for \(c\)-, \(b\)-jet and light-flavour jets, respectively. This reduces the relative contribution from the kinematically irreducible \(ZH(b\bar{b})\) background, and improves the overall background rejection by a factor of 5.3 for a 54% loss in signal, resulting in a 7% improvement to the expected limit.

The extrapolation from the Run 2 analysis to the expected HL-LHC result is performed by scaling the signal and background expectations from the Run 2 search [8] (using both the Run 2 shapes and normalisations) by process- and category-dependent scale factors (SF). These SFs account for modifications to the integrated luminosity, signal and background production cross sections, and expected \(c\)-jet tagging performance. Run 2 performance is assumed for all physics objects relevant to this analysis, with the exception of \(c\)-jet tagging, where the effect of performance improvements expected with the HL-LHC detector are investigated.

The increased integrated luminosity is accounted for by scaling the number of expected signal and background events by the ratio of the Run 2 (36.1 fb\({}^{-1}\)) to expected HL-LHC (3000 fb\({}^{-1}\)) integrated luminosities. The increase in the expected LHC center of mass energy \(\sqrt{s}\) from 13 TeV to 14 TeV is accounted for with a \(p_{T}^{Z}\)-category dependent scaling of the number of events for the \(ZH(c\bar{c})\) and \(ZH(b\bar{b})\) processes. The scaling is based on the exclusive \(pp\to ZH\) cross sections from [11], accounting for variations across the two \(p_{T}^{Z}\)-categories using a PYTHIA8-based generator-level Monte Carlo (MC) simulation [12]. The 13 TeV predictions for the \(Z+\mathrm{jets}\) and diboson backgrounds are scaled using the 14 TeV prediction assuming the ratio of parton luminosities for \(q\bar{q}\) initiated processes, and the \(t\bar{t}\) background is scaled assuming the ratio of parton luminosities for \(gg\) initiated processes [11].

While the normalisation of the diboson and \(t\bar{t}\) backgrounds are fixed to the SM expectation, the normalisation of the \(Z+\mathrm{jets}\) background is free to vary independently in the four fit categories. Given the large number of expected \(Z+\mathrm{jets}\) background events in the HL-LHC scenario, the normalisation of the \(Z+\mathrm{jets}\) background is estimated to be determined by the data with an uncertainty of less than 2% in all categories. As the normalisation of this background is determined in data, it is considered as a statistical uncertainty.

For the Run 2 analysis, the \(ZH(b\bar{b})\) background normalisation was allowed to vary in the fit within the uncertainties associated with the SM expectation. For the HL-LHC extrapolation, the normalisation of the \(ZH(b\bar{b})\) background is instead allowed to vary to within 14% of the SM value, corresponding to the expected uncertainty of the \(VH(b\bar{b})\) signal strength (signal yield normalised to SM expectation) measurement for an integrated luminosity of 3000 fb\({}^{-1}\) at the HL-LHC [13]. This reflects the likely situation that the \(VH(b\bar{b})\) normalisation will be determined in data, possibly in a combined \(VH(b\bar{b})\) and \(VH(c\bar{c})\) fit, hence the corresponding uncertainty is not considered as a systematic uncertainty associated to this analysis directly, but rather as statistical in nature.

## 3 Results

The expected 95% CL\({}_{s}\)[7] upper limit on the signal strength in the absence of systematic uncertainties is found to be \(\mu_{ZH(c\bar{c})}<6.3^{+2.5}_{-1.8}\), where the uncertainty corresponds to the \(\pm 1\sigma\) interval of background-only pseudo-experiments. The best fit value for the \(ZH(c\bar{c})\) expected signal strength is \(\mu_{ZH(c\bar{c})}=1.0\pm 3.2\), and the \(m_{c\bar{c}}\) distributions in the four analysis categories are shown in Figure 1. The expected yields for the signal and background processes in each category are shown in Table 1.

Allowing the \(Z+\mathrm{jets}\) normalisation to float in the fit has an impact of \(+21\%\) on the expected limit for an integrated luminosity of \(3000\,\mathrm{fb}^{-1}\), relative to the case where it is fixed to the nominal prediction in each category. The limit improves by only \(\sim 1\%\) when the \(ZH(b\bar{b})\) background normalisation is fixed to its SM expectation, showing that the expected \(ZH(b\bar{b})\) signal strength measurement is sufficient to constrain this background.

In the context of this study, the sensitivity at the end of Run 3 was also evaluated under the assumption of \(300\,\mathrm{fb}^{-1}\) of \(13\,\mathrm{Te\kern-1.0ptV}\)\(pp\) collision data. The analysis method and systematic uncertainties assumed are identical to those of the Run 2 analysis. At the end of Run 3 the 95% CL\({}_{s}\) expected upper limit on the \(ZH(c\bar{c})\) signal strength is \(\mu_{ZH(c\bar{c})}<38^{+18}_{-10}\), estimated with a fit close to that of the Run 2 search [8].

The Asimov Data corresponds to the sum of expected signal and background events, while the stacked histogram corresponds only to the backgrounds. The error bars represent the statistical uncertainty in the expected number of data events.

## 4 Systematic Uncertainties

Systematic uncertainties affecting the Run 2 analysis are modelled as nuisance parameters in the fit. Due to the changes to the detector and the analysis strategy expected for the HL-LHC analysis, it is difficult to estimate the precise sources and effects of systematic uncertainties. However, the impact of some of the dominant sources of systematic uncertainty in the Run 2 analysis, estimated based on their impact in the Run 2 analysis, is studied to estimate the susceptibility of the HL-LHC sensitivity to pertinent systematic uncertainties. Individual nuisance parameters from the Run 2 analysis are assigned to broad groups (e.g. \(c\)-jet tagging and background shape) based on the nature of the systematic uncertainties they correspond to. The effect of each group of nuisance parameters on the 95% CL\({}_{s}\) expected upper limit on the \(ZH(c\bar{c})\) signal strength is evaluated by repeating the fit with all of the nuisance parameters in a given group introduced to the fit. The impact of these groups of uncertainties on the sensitivity is summarised in Table 2. The uncertainties associated with the nuisance parameters can be constrained in the fit. The largest constraints occur for the nuisance parameters associated with the \(Z+\mathrm{jets}\) background shape, \(c\)-jet tagging efficiency and jet energy scale and resolution uncertainties, representing the ability to more precisely control these sources of uncertainty using the large amount of data at the HL-LHC. Compared to the Run 2 analysis, the HL-LHC analysis experiences a reduced exposure to the uncertainties associated with the tagging efficiency measurements, due to the reduced light-flavour jet component in the background as a result of the tighter operating point, and due to the uncertainty on the \(c\)-jet tagging efficiency being constrained in the fit.

The uncertainty in the shape of the \(Z+\mathrm{jets}\) background, due to the modelling of the underlying event and the parton shower, is likely to represent the dominant limitation to the sensitivity of the analysis, and will therefore require careful consideration in a HL-LHC analysis. However, the impact of the experimental systematics uncertainties (e.g. the \(c\)-jet tagging efficiency uncertainty) in a HL-LHC scenario will likely reduce relative to their effect on the Run 2 analysis given the large datasets available, allowing precise performance studies to be conducted. This effect is estimated in this study through the constraints on the associated nuisance parameters.

## 5 Flavour Tagging Improvements

Preliminary studies into the \(b\)-jet tagging performance of ATLAS at the HL-LHC suggest an improvement of around a factor of 2.5 [14] in the light-flavour jet rejection. Assuming a factor of 2.5 improvement for the light-flavour jet rejection, for a fixed \(b\)-jet rejection and \(c\)-jet efficiency, an 8% improvement in the limit can be expected. Furthermore, \(c\)-jet tagging in a hadron collider environment is a very active area of research which is currently less mature than \(b\)-jet tagging. Significant improvements in the performance of \(c\)-jet tagging algorithms can be expected in coming years.

## 6 Potential Analysis Improvements

This limit likely represents an overestimation of the sensitivity of the analysis, due to the absence of systematic uncertainties. However, various improvements to the analysis strategy could increase the sensitivity significantly. In particular, other production channels, such as \(Z(\nu\nu)H\) and \(W(\ell\nu)H\), are known to exhibit comparable sensitivity to the \(Z(\ell\ell)H\) channel in the analogous analysis for \(H\to b\bar{b}\) decays [15]. Furthermore, the use of multivariate analysis (MVA) techniques (such as Boosted Decision Trees) was also shown to provide further sensitivity improvements. The inclusion of these additional production channels and an MVA-based analysis strategy could provide significantly enhanced sensitivity for the \(H\to c\bar{c}\) analysis if adopted.

## 7 Conclusions

The expected sensitivity of a search for \(pp\to Z(\ell^{+}\ell^{-})H(c\bar{c})\) has been evaluated by extrapolating the results of a Run 2 search, performed by ATLAS using a \(\sqrt{s}=13\,\mathrm{TeV}\)\(pp\) collision dataset corresponding to an integrated luminosity of \(36.1\,\mathrm{fb}^{-1}\). Assuming an integrated luminosity of \(3000\,\mathrm{fb}^{-1}\) of \(\sqrt{s}=14\,\mathrm{TeV}\) of \(pp\) collision data at the HL-LHC, a 95% CL\({}_{s}\) upper limit on the \(ZH(c\bar{c})\) signal strength of \(\mu_{ZH(c\bar{c})}<6.3\) can be expected, in the absence of systematic uncertainties. While, based on this projection, an observation is not expected, such a limit would provide strong constraints on new physics models, and provide a competitive direct limit on the Yukawa coupling of the Higgs boson to \(c\) quarks.
