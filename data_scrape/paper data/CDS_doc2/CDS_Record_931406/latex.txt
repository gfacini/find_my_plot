**Abstract**

The ATLAS sensitivity for the H/A\(\rightarrow\)\(\mu^{+}\)\(\mu^{-}\) decay (m\({}_{\rm A}=\)300 GeV/c\({}^{2}\) and tan\(\beta=\)30) has been estimated using the full simulation of the ATLAS detector, for the initial detector running. The selection criteria have been optimized for both the direct and the associated production with b-quarks. For this particular point of the MSSM parameter space, the direct production is dominated by the irreducible Drell-Yan background. One has to rely mostly on the associated production for which about 30 fb\({}^{-1}\) of integrated luminosity are necessary for obtaining statistically significant results (at the \(>\)3\(\sigma\) level). Indicative results at different m\({}_{\rm A}\)'s and tan\(\beta\) are also given in the framework of the so called \({\rm M_{h}}^{\rm max}\) scenario.

## 1 Introduction

The H\(\rightarrow\)\(\mu\)\(\mu\) decay channel in the framework of the SM is very hard to be observed experimentally, since its predicted branching ratio to two muons is very small and the backgrounds from several SM processes are large.

In the framework of the MSSM, the Higgs boson sector contains two charged Higgs bosons (H\({}^{\pm}\)) and three neutral Higgs bosons (h, H \({}^{0}\) and A\({}^{0}\)). The A\(\rightarrow\)\(ll\) decay channel, for large values of \(\tan\!\!\beta\) is strongly enhanced [1] and can be used either as a discovery channel or for excluding a large region of the (m\({}_{\rm A}\), \(\tan\!\!\beta\)) parameter space. Furthermore, for m\({}_{\rm A}\)\(>\)150 GeV/c\({}^{2}\), the H and A bosons are approximately degenerate in mass, so their signal rates in the \(ll\) channel can be added, thus doubling the number of signal events.

Out of the H/A\(\rightarrow\)\(ll\) decay channels, the H/A\(\rightarrow\)\(\tau\) has been extensively studied [2] since it has a large branching ratio. Nevertheless, the \(\tau\) identification, through its decay channels, always presents an experimental challenge.

The rates for H/A\(\rightarrow\)\(\mu\)\(\mu\) channel are governed by the same couplings in the production as for the \(\tau\) channel, but the branching ratio scales as (m\({}_{\mu}\)/m\({}_{\rm t}\))\({}^{2}\). Despite the huge reduction of the signal rate, the H/A \(\rightarrow\)\(\mu\)\(\mu\) decay channel has the advantage of the very clear experimental signature. Furthermore, a full reconstruction of the Higgs boson final state is possible, which allows a direct mass measurement.

The MSSM H and A Higgs bosons are predominantly produced either directly by gg \(\rightarrow\)H/A, or in association with \(b\overline{b}\) quarks, by gg\(\to b\overline{b}\) H/A mechanism. For large values of _tan_\(\beta\), the production is dominated by the \(b\overline{b}H\) and \(b\overline{b}A\), and the H \(\rightarrow\)\(\mu\)\(\mu\) rates are very similar to the A \(\rightarrow\)\(\mu\)\(\mu\) ones. The final state contains two isolated high-p\({}_{\rm T}\) muons and, for the associated production, two additional spectator \(b\)-quarks. The signal can be observed as a narrow peak in the invariant dimuon mass distribution, m\({}_{\mu\mu}\), but in a lot of cases the background is much larger than the signal and is dominated by the irreducible Z/\(\gamma^{*}\) Drell-Yan background.

The layout of this note is as following: In section 2 we briefly discuss the relevant production and decay rates of the MSSM Higgs boson, which help us derive the results of section 7 and 8. In sections 3 and 4 the simulated samples used in this analysis as well as the reconstruction methods are presented, respectively. In section 5 and 6 we present our selection criteria and the estimation of their efficiencies respectively. In section 7 our analysis is presented for the background rejection and the extraction of results for the particular MSSM point which we analyze. A short discussion on the extrapolation of our results to different values of m\({}_{\rm A}\) and \(\tan\!\!\beta\) is given in section 8 and finally our conclusions are given in section 9.

## 2 Production and decay of the MSSM Higgs bosons

In this study we have followed the \(\rm{M_{h}^{\,\,\max}}\) scenario of reference [3]. The main advantage of this scenario is that it maximizes the mass of the lightest neutral Higgs boson h (\(M_{h}^{\,\,\max}\)\(\leq\)\(135GeV/c^{2}\)) with respect to \(\tan\!\!\beta\) and therefore yields conservative \(\tan\!\!\beta\) exclusion limits from LEP. For the calculation of the associated production cross section we used the program HQQ [4] which performs LO calculations and for the direct, the program hipl [5] which performs NLO calculations respectively. In both cases (as well as for the calculation of the branching ratios) we left two SUSY

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:3]

The differences of cross-sections between Table 1.1 (pole mass scenario) and Table 1.2 (running mass scenario at the scale (m\({}_{\rm A}\)+2m\({}_{\rm b}\))/2) are large: the production cross sections differ by almost a factor of three. For 150 \(<\) m\({}_{\rm A}\)\(<\) 500 GeV/c\({}^{2}\), irrespective of the tan\(\beta\) value, the running mass calculation yields the cross sections which are 0.36-0.32 times the pole mass ones.(The production cross section for the H boson exhibits similar behaviour, so we avoided duplicating the same numbers in table 1.2).

In Table 2 the results for the direct production are presented for a specific m\({}_{\rm A}\) mass (300 GeV/c\({}^{2}\)) and different tan\(\beta\) values.

However, the direct production may be important at the low tan\(\beta\) region. The second observation is that the A and H associated production cross sections, in this scenario, are comparable and almost identical at large masses, enlarging the experimental discovery potential.

The widths of the Higgs bosons were calculated with the same program which was used for the branching ratios HDECAY with the subhole algorithm [7]. They are shown in **Fig. 2(a)** as a function of the tan\(\beta\) and tabulated in Table 3.

For m\({}_{\rm A}\)\(>\)\(>\)M\({}_{\rm h}^{\rm max}\), the H and A are degenerate in mass and width and are practically indistinguishable.

The branching ratio A\(\rightarrow\)\(\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\) as a function of tan\(\beta\) for different masses is presented in **Fig. 2(b)**. As it can be observed its value is almost flat for rather large values of tan\(\beta\) independent of the mass of the A and the tan\(\beta\) value.

Combining the results of the calculations of the associated production cross section and the branching ratio to a \(\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\) pair we can construct Table 4 for the expected cross-sections of H/A \(\rightarrow\)\(\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\) in the pole mass scenario. The values of the table are also plotted for different values of tan\(\beta\) in **Fig. 3**. Despite the differences in the nature of the decay mechanisms of the A and H, their branching ratios and

## 3 Simulated data samples

Accurate simulations of the physics processes and of the detector response are essential for a good understanding of the physics discovery potential. In this study we investigated the sensitivity of the ATLAS low luminosity running on one of the MSSM Higgs bosons, the A, using the full detector simulation for the initial ATLAS setup during the starting period of the LHC. There have been other similar studies of this discovery channel [8, 9], which are summarized in a recent ATLAS MSSM discovery plot (**Fig. 4**). Most studies so far, used the ATLAS Fast Simulation, ATLFAST [10]. Although the above decay can be used for exploiting a large region of the MSSM parameter space, due to the huge computer power needed to simulate the signal under full simulation, we have simulated only one particular parameter space point, \(\rm m_{A}\) =300 GeV/c\({}^{2}\) and \(\rm tan\beta\) =30. Moreover, due to the large number of physics samples simulated by the Rome-data simulation, **only the associated production \(b\overline{b}A\rightarrow\mu\mu\) (at the above stated point in the MSSM parameter space) has been produced with full detector simulation.**

For this study we have analyzed the following background samples: irreducible Z/\(\gamma\)* \(\rightarrow\mu\mu\) Drell-Yan production, \(t\bar{t}\) production, \(Zb\overline{b}\to 41\) and ZZ*\(\rightarrow 41\) production.

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:8]

This generation included diagrams of the type gg \(\to Zb\bar{b}\)  and did not include \(q\overline{q}\to Zb\bar{b}\), which was later taken into account (see footnote 6)
* ZZ*\(\to\) 41 events (sample: rome.004320.recov10.Pythia ZZ_4l) with the four-lepton filter, were generated using PYTHIA (6.203) event generator.

The interactions of the generated particles with the detector material and the detector response have been simulated using the full detector simulation package based on GEANT4. The 9.0.4 ATLAS Software Release was used for the event generation, and 10.0.1 for the event simulation and reconstruction. Software release 10.0.1 was not validated for either simulation or reconstruction and the results obtained with it should be treated with caution. No cavern background or pile-up was included.

During the event simulation with the GEANT4, the parameters for the track propagation in the magnetic field were not tuned and this caused a systematic shift of about 10\(\upmu\)m in the Inner Detector [12]. More precisely, in GEANT4 the intersect of the track with a volume is always within the curvature of the track, causing a systematic shift, different for different charges. The size of this error can be reduced if a smaller "delta intersect" parameter is used. However, in the Rome sample the default parameter value was used, which translated to about 1.5% shift in the reconstructed H/A mass with respect to the generated one. This is visible in the plots shown hereafter. The above propagation parameter was reduced for the releases which followed the Rome-data generation and the shift disappeared thereafter.

Table 5 shows the applied filters, the filter efficiencies and the number of events for the signal and background samples.

\end{table}
Table 5: Data samples produced with the full detector simulation, filter applied to the samples, efficiency of the filter and the number of events used in this analysis.

For this study, both the direct and the associated production of the H/A bosons decaying to two muons -for the m\({}_{\rm A}\) =300 GeV/c\({}^{2}\) and tan\(\beta\) =30 space point- were considered. Since only the associated production was fully simulated, we have generated a large number of direct and associated signal events using ATLFAST. This way we could estimate the relative rates normalizing to the associated production. (see the beginning of section 6 for more details). In the future, both productions will be fully simulated. We have also used ATLFAST, to generate signal events at the same mass but at different values of _tan_\(\beta\). We used those samples to make sure that the kinematical properties of the signal events, where we applied the selection criteria were similar to the ones at _tan_\(\beta\)=30_. That way we could extend our results to different values of tan \(\beta\) (see section 6). As a final step, we have also used ATLFAST, to generate signal events at different masses. The results are presented in section 9 but are only indicative.

We used ATLFAST to produce a large number of events for the irreducible backgrounds. We have used those samples to extensively study their basic kinematical characteristics, which were then used for understanding the efficiency of the different requirements on the different production mechanisms. Moreover, for the fully simulated background samples which involved multi-lepton production, namely \(t\bar{t}\,Zb\bar{b}\,\ ZZ\)*, we have used the ones generated with the four lepton filter (as shown on Table 5), because they were the only available. However, for the \(t\bar{t}\) case -which is the main background in the associated production case- as well as for the \(Zb\bar{b}\) case, we have checked using ATLFAST, that the four lepton filter, does not introduce any significant bias (see discussion later).

## 4 Reconstruction

As stated above, the signal and background processes have been analyzed using the full detector simulation, which uses the detailed geometry of all the detector components for the Rome-Initial detector layout. Efficient and accurate muon reconstruction is important for all studies involving muons in the final state. In ATLAS, the muon reconstruction relies heavily on the performance of the Muon Spectrometer as it provides the identification of muons in the low momentum region, where the Inner Detector performance dominates the momentum resolution2, and an accurate momentum resolution in the high momentum region, namely \(\delta\)P\({}_{\rm T}\)/P\({}_{\rm T}\) = 10% for P\({}_{\rm T}\) = 1000 GeV/c.

Footnote 2: The Inner Detector dominates the muon momentum resolution for P\({}_{\rm T}\)\(<80\) GeV/c in the Barrel Region and P\({}_{\rm T}\)\(<20\) GeV/c in the EndCap region.

The Rome-Initial layout, in what concerns the Muon Spectrometer, differs from the standard one. The main difference is that EE chambers in the Barrel-EndCap transition region are not present. The same applies for one layer of the CSC chambers. A previous study [13] of the impact of the staged EE chambers has indicated that the loss of the H/A significance in the above mass region is at most 5%. In this study, we find that the removal of the EE chambers results in drop of the muon reconstruction efficiency around the \(|\eta|\)=1.2 region of about 40%, which translates in an overall drop of the muon reconstruction efficiency -and therefore of the H/A signal- of about 3 %.

Within the ATLAS Muon Software there are two complete and independent muon reconstruction methods: Muonboy/Staco and Moore/MuID [14]. For this study the Moore/MulD reconstruction procedure was selected, although both algorithms yielded comparable results for the signal efficiency and the rejection of the various backgrounds. Moore and MuID are two complementary reconstruction packages developed for muon reconstruction:

* MOORE performs pattern recognition and track reconstruction inside the Muon Spectrometer. The procedure starts with a search for regions of activity within the detector and the output objects are muon tracks whose parameters are expressed at the first measured point inside the Muon Spectrometer.
* MuID has a twofold aim: backtracking of the muon track from the entrance of the Muon Spectrometer to the Interaction Point taking into account multiple scattering and energy loss effects (Standalone reconstruction) and association/combination of the muon tracks found in Muon Spectrometer with the corresponding Inner Detector tracks3 (Combined reconstruction). In order to obtain the optimum track parameters, a combined fit is performed to all the measurements and scatterers from the Inner Detector, Calorimeter and Muon Spectrometer.

Footnote 3: For Inner Detector tracks the iPatRec reconstruction algorithm is used.

The results in the present analysis are derived from the MuID Combined reconstruction.

## 5 Cut selection

All fully simulated events were obtained for the associated production mechanism. Nevertheless, we developed two different sets of selection criteria for the optimization of the background reduction which depend on the signal topology (events coming from direct or associated production of the H/A bosons) as will be explained later in this section.

The main selection cuts applied common in both analyses, were the following:

\(\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\) pair: presence of at least two opposite sign muons which passed the two-muon filter (\(\,p_{T}^{\mu}\)\(>\)5 GeV/c and \(|\)n\(|\)\(<\)2.5). Table 6 shows the numbers of the signal and background events which are matching this selection criterion. In the second column in parenthesis is the number of events which had at least one such reconstructed pair.

* Both muons are required to have \(\,p_{T}^{\mu}>\) 50 GeV/c. This cut is very efficient in the background reduction, especially for muons coming from hadron decays. It is obvious that it is highly correlated with the invariant mass of the particle that is searched for. Nevertheless, from fast simulation studies, it is deduced that this value for the \(\,p_{T}^{\mu}\,\) cut is the optimal one. It is optimal even for H/A masses as low as 150 GeV/c\({}^{2}\), maximizing the significance, holding the rest of the cuts unchanged. In the search for an H/A boson of even lower mass it has to be relaxed. A second reason why we kept the \(\,p_{T}^{\mu}\,\) cut as high as 50 GeV/c, is the fact that we want to eliminate the contribution of the background muons coming from the decays of the b quarks (as shown in **Fig. 5**) and therefore to be able to normalize to cross sections of the backgrounds which passed the four lepton filter, instead of the two lepton one which would have been appropriate for this analysis. As shown in Fig. 5, in the \(\,t\bar{t}\,\) and the \(\,Zb\overline{b}\,\) case, the muons have much lower transverse momenta and therefore get largely suppressed by the cut.

\(p_{T}^{miss}\)\(<\) 50 GeV/c: This cut is effective in reducing background events with missing energy arising from neutrinos, like the \(t\bar{t}\) events. In **Fig. 6**, the various sample distributions are shown after the \(p_{T}^{\mu}\) cut.
* Muon isolation: only muons with electromagnetic energy deposition less than 5 GeV inside a cone4\(\Delta\)R\(<\)0.20 are accepted. In addition we require no more than two Inner Detector tracks inside the same cone. This cut is efficient for rejecting the few remaining muons in narrow jets similar to the ones which appear in both the \(Zb\overline{b}\) and the \(t\bar{t}\) background cases. Footnote 4: The cone size is defined with \(\Delta R=\sqrt{\Delta\phi^{2}+\Delta\eta^{2}}\)
* \(\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\) pair mass: the reconstructed mass has to be in the (m\({}_{\Delta}\pm\) 20 GeV/c\({}^{2}\) ) mass window. The \(\pm\) 20 GeV/c\({}^{2}\) mass window represents a 2\(\sigma\) interval resulting from the combination in quadrature of the natural width of A at this mass and tan\(\beta\) value and the experimental resolution which is roughly estimated as 3% of the mass. On this issue the full ATLAS simulation and the ATLFAST one agree, giving a Gaussian sigma of 10 GeV/c\({}^{2}\) from the mass fit.

The dashed lines in the distributions of figures (c) and (e) correspond to muons coming from quark decays.

As mentioned in the beginning of this section, further topological criteria had to be applied in order to optimize the signal selection from the two different H/A production mechanisms. These selection sets applicable to the two analyses differ in the requirement of the multiplicity and kinematics of the tagged b-jets. As a b-tagging algorithm, we have chosen the latest one developed in ATLAS, namely the SV2 one5. This algorithm uses a b-tag weight plus the combination of three secondary vertex variables to produce a final b-tag weight. The default recommended cut on the weight for tagging a b-jet is to have b-tag SV2 weight greater than 3. Since the b-jets from the signal events are less hard than the ones from the \(t\bar{t}\) background as shown in **Fig. 7** and since the weight 3 cut tends to select harder jets (see **Fig. 8**), we have also used the weight greater than 0 cut. All the following analysis is done with both cuts arriving at two different discovery significances.

* Analysis 1: b-jet veto (zero b-jets tagged above 15 GeV). Selects out the direct production as well as a percentage of the associated production which contains low \(\rm p_{T}\) b-jets, which escape the detector geometry. **Fig. 9** shows the number of b-jets in all event samples.
* Analysis 2: b-jet cut: \(\geq\) 1 tagged b-jet with the tagged jet having 15 GeV/c \(<\)\(p_{T}^{{}^{jet}}\)\(<\) 80 GeV/c. Selects out the associated production. The high \(\ p_{T}^{{}^{jet}}\)\(<\) 80 GeV/c cut helps rejecting the \(\it{t}\) events which in general contain harder b-jets (see **Fig.7**) whereas the low \(\ p_{T}^{{}^{jet}}\)\(>\) 15 GeV/c cut, is applied in order to have a meaningful b-jet tagging. Inspecting the distributions of **Fig. 9**, one could argue that a cut on one and only one b-jet could be more effective in rejecting the \(\it{t}\bar{t}\) background. Nevertheless, at this stage of low statistics samples we chose not to apply this cut. Moreover, the above cut heavily depends on the details of the b-tagging which may affect its efficiency with respect to the rapidity and the \(\rm p_{T}\) of the original b-quark.

At least one tagged b-jet (with weight\(>\)3) is required in the event. The vertical line shows the position of the cut applied

The blue distribution corresponds to tagged jets having weight\(>\)0 and the black to the ones having weight\(>\)3.The larger weight requirement produces a shift of the distribution by a few GeV/c.

In the Analysis 2 case, an additional rejection of the \(t\bar{t}\) background is necessary and hence we decided to apply an extra cut on the acoplanarity.

* Acoplanarity cut: we calculate the cosine of the angle between one of the two muons and the plane defined by the beam axis and the other muon. Namely: _acoplanarity_\(=\hat{p}_{\mu}^{1}\cdot(\hat{p}_{\mu}^{2}\times\hat{z})\) (the muons are randomly ordered) The acoplanarity tends to be rather small, in the case where both muons come from the decay of the same particle, especially when that particle has low \(\rm p_{T}\). On the other hand, when the muons come from different particles, as is the case in the \(t\bar{t}\) background, the acoplanarity angle can have any value. This is shown in **Fig. 10** where the calculated angle is shown for different event types. In Analysis 2, we have required events to have \(|\)acoplanarity\(|<\)0.75, which provides an extra rejection against the dominant \(t\bar{t}\) background.

Other cuts which were not used:

* A \(p_{T}^{\rm\mu\mu}\) cut which was applied in older analyses (ex. Ref.[8]) is not applied in this analysis as it has the same efficiency in rejecting the background as well as the signal events.
* divided into muons from W's and Z's and muons from the b-quarks
- before cuts. After the previously described cuts, the impact parameter distributions seems to be similar for both the signal and the background muons coming from the W's and the Z's. The muons coming from the b-quark decays have been eliminated by the previous cuts. For this reason, we decided not to apply the impact parameter cut.

## 6 Estimation of the selection efficiencies

The efficiency of the requirements applied on the direct production sample-which was not fully simulated- was assumed to be the same as the ones for the associated production case, except for the \(p_{T}^{miss}\) and the b-tagging veto cases. For those requirements the efficiency was estimated assuming that the direct signal behaves like the irreducible Z\(\rightarrow\)\(\mu\mu\) background. Thus the efficiency of these two cuts is assumed to be the same as the ones for the corresponding cuts on the Z\(\rightarrow\)\(\mu\mu\) sample. For the estimation of the final signal significance the results from both the analyses were combined.

As already mentioned in section 3, the four lepton filter was used for the full simulation of the background samples. To study the effect of a possible bias, we have studied the ATLFAST samples of \(t\bar{t}\) and \(Zb\bar{b}\) events. More precisely, we have inspected the distributions of the quantities where we put the selection criteria comparing the ATLFAST two lepton filter events with the four lepton filter ones. Using as a starting point, the events of each sample which contain a pair of isolated muons with p\({}_{T}\)\(>\)50 GeV/c, the application of all the criteria but the mass window results to an efficiency of 16\(\pm\)1% in the \(t\bar{t}\) case passed for the 2-lepton filter sample, and 20\(\pm\)2% for the 4-lepton filtered sample. The corresponding numbers for the \(Zb\bar{b}\) sample are: 21\(\pm\)1% and 15\(\pm\)2% respectively. As a consequence, we cannot exclude the possibility that the 4-lepton filter may induce an uncertainty to the background level of the order of 20-25%. However, this is not significant compared to the statistical uncertainty of the samples with the four-lepton filter (2 events surviving at the end) and also within statistics, points to the opposite direction for the \(t\bar{t}\) and \(Zb\bar{b}\) backgrounds.

**Fig. 12** shows the effective mass distributions of the different samples -signal and background, after the filter cut, but before the selection cuts of section 5, are applied.

Table 6 shows the efficiencies of the cuts in the signal and the background samples. It is important to notice that in the analysis of the samples where the four lepton filter is applied, which is the case in the \(t\bar{t}\)\(\rightarrow\) 4l, \(Zb\bar{b}\)\(\rightarrow\)4l and ZZ*\(\rightarrow\)4l samples, only events with at least two muons in final state are accepted. Events with more than two muons in final state are analyzed in such a way that all possible opposite sign dimuon combinations are considered. However, due to the reasons mentioned above, the background muons originating from decays of b's are completely suppressed.

We have also investigated the possibility of the \(\mathrm{H}\)/\(\mathrm{A}\)\(\rightarrow\)\(\mathrm{\tau}\)\(\rightarrow\)\(\mathrm{\mu}\)\(\mathrm{\mu}\) decays which could produce some low tails in the invariant mass distribution, thus distorting its Gaussian shape. Since the BR for the decay \(\mathrm{H}\)/\(\mathrm{A}\)\(\rightarrow\)\(\mathrm{\tau}\)\(\mathrm{\tau}\)\(\mathrm{\tau}\) is about 282 times more than the \(\mathrm{H}\)/\(\mathrm{A}\)\(\rightarrow\)\(\mathrm{\mu}\)\(\mathrm{\mu}\) one, and since in about 3% of the cases we have both \(\mathrm{\tau}\)'s decaying into \(\mathrm{\mu}\)'s, in principle we get about 8.5 more \(\mathrm{\mu}\)\(\mathrm{\mu}\)'s from the \(\mathrm{\tau}\)\(\mathrm{\tau}\) decays. However, these muons tend to have lower energies, since the \(\mathrm{\tau}\)'s decay in a 3-body way and therefore result in lower invariant masses combinations. Using ATLFAST samples, we have checked that our main cut efficiency is lower for these "cascade" di-muons. Only 1% of these events have a dimuon invariant mass above 250 GeV/c\({}^{2}\) and only one out of 10,000 events enter in our selected mass region, resulting in a negligible background.

## 8 Discovery potential at different values of \(\mathbf{m_{A}}\) and \(\mathbf{tan\beta}\).

The estimation of the significance at different \(\mathrm{tan\beta}\) values can be done in a straight forward way, since the only difference that can affect the efficiency of the selection criteria, is the physical width of the Higgs bosons. In **Fig. 14** all the other kinematical variables used for the application of the selection criteria are shown to have very similar distributions. Therefore, the significance is affected only by the different mass windows which are used for the event selection and affect both the number of signal and background events. The window is defined as two sigma of the total width (physical plus the one due to the experiment resolution).

Using the values of Table 3 for the natural width of the Higgs bosons and extracting the experimental resolution for this mass value as \(\sigma_{\mathrm{exp}}\)= 9.5 \(\mathrm{GeV/c^{2}}\) from fits, we estimate the mass windows (2 sigmas) as being: 19, 20, 21 and 23 \(\mathrm{GeV/c^{2}}\) for \(\mathrm{tan\beta}\)\(\leq\) 20, 30, 40 and 50 respectively. The expected number of the background events

Table 8 is thus safely constructed and represents the significance for the discovery of H/A of 300 GeV/c\({}^{2}\) mass for different tan\(\beta\) values and for two different analyses. Table 8.1 is constructed with the calculation of pole mass, while in 8.2 the running b mass assumption was used. Both tables are based on the b-tagging weight being smaller than 0, the so called "softer" cut, since it produces a larger significance for the signal

The estimation of the discovery potential with respect to the mass of A is more elaborate, since there are many different factors which could affect the detector response both in what concerns the efficiency of the reconstruction and the selection but also in what concerns the mass resolution. In **Fig. 15** we present distributions of key kinematical variables for the analysis, at generator level.

While, there are small differences in all the distributions, the main one, as expected, is the one of the \(p_{ T}^{u}\) of the muons. Both the full simulation study and the ATLFAST one, indicate that the backgrounds (\(t\bar{t}\rightarrow\)\(\mu\mu\) and \(Zb\bar{b}\rightarrow\mu\mu\)) increase rapidly with the reduction of value of the \(p_{ T}^{u}\) cut. These backgrounds are around three times higher if the value of \(p_{ T}^{u}\) cut is lowered to a value of \(>\)30 GeV/c\({}^{2}\). It seems therefore appropriate to use exactly the same criteria of section 4, for the analysis of signal masses as low as 150 GeV/c\({}^{2}\).

For the estimation of the background - for each relevant mass window namely 8, 12, 16, 20, 25 and 30 GeV/c\({}^{2}\) for m\({}_{\rm A}\)=150, 200, 250, 300, 350 and 400 GeV/c\({}^{2}\) respectively - we use the fully simulated samples as they are described in section 2. For the evaluation of the signal efficiencies we use the fast simulated samples with different H/A masses. So, for the requirements for which their kinematical distribution is similar for the different masses - namely, the dimuon reconstruction efficiency, the b-tagging, the cut on the p\({}_{\rm T}\) of the b-jets and missing energy cut- we use for their efficiencies the exact numbers which were deduced from the fully simulated samples. For the efficiencies of the rest of the cuts, the values of fast simulation samples scaled to the reference m\({}_{\rm A}\)=300 GeV/c\({}^{2}\) fully simulated sample are used. More precisely, the efficiencies of these cuts were evaluated in the following way: from the fast simulated samples, the ratio between event numbers of the different mass samples with respect to the ATLFAST m\({}_{\rm A}\)=300 GeV/c\({}^{2}\) and tan\(\beta\)=30 sample, were calculated. The efficiency was then evaluated, normalizing to the efficiency of the reference fully simulated sample. Namely:

Conclusions

The sensitivity of the ATLAS low luminosity running, for the MSSM Higgs bosons, the H and A decaying to two muons was studied. For this study both the direct and the associated production of the H/A bosons decaying to two muons, for the parameter space point (m\({}_{\rm A}\)=300GeV/c\({}^{2}\), _tan_\(\beta\)=30) were considered and two different analyses, corresponding to the production mechanisms, were proposed. The signal significance is calculated for both analyses separately.

The background analyzed in this study consists of the following channels: Drell-Yan (\(Z\)/ \(\gamma\)*\(\rightarrow\)\(\mu\)\(\mu\)), \(Zb\overline{b}\rightarrow\)4l, \(ZZ\)*\(\rightarrow\)4l and \(t\overline{t}\rightarrow\) 4l (where only muons in final state are selected). The irreducible Drell-Yan background dominates in the direct production case and overwhelms the signal in such a way that the direct production produces a very low significance result, which does not help the discovery potential. In the associated production case, the \(Zb\overline{b}\) background is the irreducible one, but the most abundant is the \(t\overline{t}\) background and the selection criteria applied had to be optimized for its reduction. The samples used were simulated and reconstructed with the full simulation chain.

The main conclusions are that for discovering the H/A with m\({}_{\rm A}\)=300GeV/c\({}^{2}\) and _tan_\(\beta\)\(>\)30, through its dimuon decay channel at more than the three sigma level, one needs about three years of running at the low luminosity. A 5\(\sigma\) discovery contour for the H/A, in the (m\({}_{\rm A}\), _tan_\(\beta\)) parameter space, in the context of the M\({}_{\rm h}\)\({}^{\rm max}\) scenario, is also presented. However, one should note that if the calculations of the H/A production cross sections are performed using the running mass scenario, then the resulting significances are on the average lower by a factor of three.

One should note that the present results are up-to-date concerning the detector description with the full simulation chain therefore cannot be directly compared to previous analyses of the same channel which were done using the ATLFAST.

Results obtained here cannot be combined or directly compared with other full simulation studies as this study used a different (unvalidated) software release.

**Appendix**

As can be observed from Figure 13 of the text (section 7), the number of background events surviving the final cuts of analysis 2, are very limited. This induces a large uncertainty in the evaluation of the expected background events and therefore in the calculation of the corresponding significances. In order to allow for a safer estimation of the expected backgrounds we decided to fit the whole mass spectrum of the background distributions, exploiting the fact that in the low mass region the number of surviving background events is higher.

The \(t\bar{t}\) background was fitted using an exponential parametrization of the mass distribution. Since, on one hand the fit to the Z/\(\gamma^{*}\rightarrow\mu\mu\) background is uncertain due to the small statistics, and since on the other hand we have more statistics from the similar type background events which survive the analysis 1 criteria., we decided to proceed as follows: we assumed that the mass spectra in the two analyses (which mostly depend on kinematics) are similar in shape and we fitted the analysis 1 mass distribution with a Breit-Wigner fit, leaving all its parameters free. Furthermore, we fitted the analysis 2 distribution with a Breit-Wigner where only its overall normalization was left as a free variable (the mean and width were taken from the previous fit). For completeness we performed the same procedure on the \(Zb\bar{b}\) background, in this case starting the fit from analysis 2 since it had more statistics.

The plots of the background distributions as a function of the reconstructed mass and the corresponding fits are shown in **Figure A1**. In table A1, a comparison of the fitted values with respect to the ones counted from the spectra is presented.
