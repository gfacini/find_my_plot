## 1 Introduction

The large single electroweak boson production cross section and clean leptonic decays of the \(W\) and \(Z\) bosons provide an ideal environment to study kinematics of \(W\) and \(Z\) production and decay with the first collected data from Run2 at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN. In fact, inclusive \(W\) and \(Z\) boson production are expected to increase by a factor of 1.7 in 13 TeV proton-proton collisions compared to 8 TeV. Furthermore, these studies are vital to validate the object reconstruction, detector calibration, and detector simulation. This note presents distributions of \(W\to\ell\nu\) and \(Z\to\ell^{+}\ell^{-}\) boson candidates recorded by the ATLAS experiment from \(pp\) collisions at \(\sqrt{s}=13\) TeV in the LHC. The distributions focus on inclusive \(W\) and \(Z\) boson production as well as associated jet production in \(Z\)+jets events.

## 2 Data set description

The ATLAS detector [1] is a large general-purpose apparatus located at the LHC. The detector has undergone several recent upgrades, including the installation of the Insertable B-Layer pixel detector, a smaller beampipe, additional muon chambers, and new trigger hardware. In addition, significant updates to the physics object reconstruction algorithms are being applied for the first time to the 13 TeV data.

The data presented in the distributions below were collected over a two-day period in June 2015. During this period, the LHC circulated 6.5 TeV proton beams with 50 ns bunch spacing. The peak delivered instantaneous luminosity was \(L=1.5\times 10^{32}\) cm\({}^{-1}\) s\({}^{-1}\), and the peak mean number of pileup events was \(\langle\mu\rangle=24.8\). (The mean number of pileup events after selection is 18.7.)

The data set has been screened for problems with subdetector systems or operational inefficiencies. The analysed data passing these basic data-quality requirements correspond to a total integrated luminosity of \((6.4\pm 0.6)\) pb\({}^{-1}\). The uncertainty on the integrated luminosity is \(\pm 9\%\). It is derived, following a methodology similar to that detailed in Ref. [2], from a preliminary calibration of the luminosity scale using a pair of \(x\)-\(y\) beam-separation scans performed in June 2015.

The data are compared to Monte Carlo simulations. Nearly all of the expected distributions were generated with the Powheg Monte Carlo program [3, 4, 5], specifically the codes for single boson production [6], interfaced with the Pythia v.8.1 parton shower program [7]. The programs used the CT10 parton distribution functions [8] and the AZNLO CTEQL1 tune for Powheg +Pythia[9]. The EvtGen v1.2.0 program [10] was used for properties of the bottom and charm hadron decays, and Photos++ version 3.52 [11] was used for QED emissions from electroweak vertices and charged leptons. The expected contributions of the \(W\) and \(Z\) boson samples are normalised to a cross section value calculated at NNLO with the FEWZ program [12], using the MSTW2008NNLO parton distribution functions [13].

The distributions of top quark production (both \(t\bar{t}\) and single top) were generated with the Powheg-Box v2 generator [14] and Pythia v.6.4 [15] (Perugia 2012 tune), and the pair production is normalised to the cross section calculated at NNLO+NNLL with the Top++2.0 program [16]. Samples of simulated \(Z\)+jets events and diboson events were generated with Sherpa v2.1.1 [17]. Matrix elements for the \(Z\)+jets samples are calculated for up to 2 partons at NLO and 4 partons at LO using the Comix [18] and OpenLoops [19] matrix element generators and merged with the Sherpa parton shower [20] using the ME+PS@NLO prescription [21]. Matrix elements for the diboson samples are calculated for 0/1 partons at NLO and up to 3 partons at LO using the same generators and merged with the same parton shower.

Multiple overlaid proton-proton collisions were simulated with the soft QCD processes of Pythia using tune A2 [22] and the MSTW2008LO PDF. The pileup distributions of the Monte Carlo samples have been reweighted so that the \(\langle\mu\rangle\) distribution matches the observed distribution in the data. All of the samples were processed with the Geant-based simulation [23] of the ATLAS detector [24].

## 3 Lepton identification and event selection

Electron and muon candidate events are selected online by single-lepton triggers with transverse momentum thresholds of \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>24\,\mathrm{GeV}\) and \(20\,\mathrm{GeV}\), respectively, with loose energy-based isolation requirements.1 Additional electron and muon triggers that do not make any isolation requirements are included with thresholds of \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>60\,\mathrm{GeV}\) and \(50\,\mathrm{GeV}\), respectively. Only electrons and muons reconstructed offline with \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>25\,\mathrm{GeV}\) are considered for the event selections that follow.

Footnote 1: ATLAS uses a right-handed coordinate system with its origin at the nominal interaction point (IP) in the centre of the detector and the \(z\)-axis along the beam pipe. The \(x\)-axis points from the IP to the centre of the LHC ring, and the \(y\)-axis points upward. Cylindrical coordinates (\(r,\phi\)) are used in the transverse plane, \(\phi\) being the azimuthal angle around the beam pipe. The pseudorapidity is defined in terms of the polar angle \(\theta\) as \(\eta=-\ln\tan(\theta/2)\).

Candidate events are required to have a reconstructed hard-scatter vertex with at least two associated tracks. If more than one vertex is reconstructed, the vertex with the highest sum of track \(p_{T}^{2}\) is identified as the primary vertex.

Electrons are reconstructed in the region \(|\eta|<2.47\) (excluding the barrel-endcap overlap region at \(1.37<|\eta|<1.52\)) by associating an electromagnetic calorimeter cluster to an inner-detector track. All electrons must pass the "medium" likelihood-based identification, constructed from calorimeter shower shapes and measurements of energy loss in the inner detector. The electrons must also satisfy a \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\)-dependent cone-based energy isolation requirement, tuned so that the electron identification efficiency varies smoothly in a gradient from 90% at \(p_{\mathrm{T}}=25\,\mathrm{GeV}\) to 99% at \(p_{\mathrm{T}}=60\,\mathrm{GeV}\).

Muons are reconstructed in the region \(|\eta|<2.4\) by associating muon spectrometer tracks to an inner-detector track. All muons must pass the "medium" identification requirements, based on inner detector and muon spectrometer hit counting and the \(q/p\) significance. They must also satisfy the same isolation requirements as the electrons.

Jets are reconstructed from calorimeter clusters using the anti-\(k_{t}\) algorithm [25] with radius parameter \(R=0.4\) and pseudorapidity requirement \(|\eta|<4.4\). A reduced subset of these jets is used for the jet multiplicity distributions. The jet counting includes only anti-\(k_{t}\) jets with \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>30\,\mathrm{GeV}\) and \(|y|<2.5\). In order to reduce the effects of pileup contributions, a significant fraction of tracks in each jet are required to have origins compatible with the primary vertex, and the expected average contribution from pileup clusters is subtracted according to the jet area.

The missing transverse momentum vector is defined as the negative of the global vector sum of all identified physics objects (electrons, muons, jets) as well as specific "soft terms" accounting for unclassified tracks and calorimeter clusters. In this way, the missing transverse momentum is adjusted for the best calibration of the jets and the other identified physics objects above.

## 4 \(W\) boson production signatures

The \(W\) boson signature event selection requires exactly one identified electron or muon. If a second lepton passing the same quality kinematics requirements is present in the event, the entire event is rejected. The magnitude of calibrated missing transverse momentum is required to be \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}>25\,\mathrm{GeV}\), and the transverse mass is required to satisfy \(m_{T}>50\,\mathrm{GeV}\), where

\[m_{T}=\sqrt{2p_{T}^{\ell}E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\left[1-\cos\left(\phi _{\ell}-\phi_{E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}}\right)\right]}.\]

A total of 33,200 events are observed in the \(W\to e\nu\) event selection, while 36,400 events are observed in the \(W\to\mu\nu\) selection. The kinematic distributions for both \(W\to e\nu\) and \(W\to\mu\nu\) are shown in Figs. 1-4.

Background contributions from electroweak boson (including \(W\) and \(Z\) boson production with other decay signatures) and top quark production are estimated from Monte Carlo simulations, and all expected distributions are normalised to the integrated luminosity of the data set, using the calculated cross sections. The background contribution from multijet production is estimated with data-driven techniques. For the muon channel, the multijet background normalisation is estimated from data using events fulfilling the analysis selection but satisfying \(m_{T}<15\,\mathrm{GeV}\), and subtracting contributions from other sources using Monte Carlo simulation. This estimate is extrapolated to the signal region by means of a multijet background \(m_{T}\) template, which is generated in a data control region where the isolation requirement is inverted and contributions from other processes have been removed using Monte Carlo simulation. For the electron channel, the relative contributions of electroweak and multijet production are fit to the entire \(m_{T}\) data distribution, using a multijet template derived from a QCD-enriched region in data. The fit in the electron channel yields a multijet contribution of 3% of the total data sample after all selection. The extrapolation in the muon channel yields a multijet contribution of 3%. The dominant systematic uncertainties for these results are related to the choices of multijet fit templates.

The efficiencies and scales, as well as their corresponding systematic uncertainties, are estimated from Run 1 data and from the 8 and 13 TeV simulations, extrapolated to the expected Run 2 early running conditions. Data-driven correction factors would be needed to further improve the agreement of data with simulation in the distributions, notably in the electron channel. (The muon trigger efficiencies have been measured in Monte Carlo and corrected by data-driven scale factors to take into account differences observed between data and simulation. The statistical uncertainties associated with these corrections contribute significantly to the muon systematic uncertainty bands in the distributions.)

Systematic uncertainties are calculated on the following components:

* uncertainty due to the multijet background estimation method
* lepton energy and momentum scale and resolution;
* lepton trigger efficiency;
* lepton reconstruction and identification efficiency, including uncertainties on lepton isolation;
* jet energy scale and resolution;
* soft (unclustered) energy contributions in the \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\) reconstruction;* uncertainties in cross section calculations for electroweak and top quark production; and
* statistical uncertainty due to limited Monte Carlo sample sizes.

These uncertainties are included in the histograms as a shaded band, but the luminosity uncertainty of \(\pm 9\%\) is explicitly omitted from the uncertainty bands.

## 5 \(Z\) boson production signatures

The \(Z\) boson signature event selection requires exactly two identified electrons or muons of opposite charge. The invariant mass of the lepton pair must satisfy \(66\,\mathrm{GeV}<m_{\ell\ell}<116\,\mathrm{GeV}\).

A total of 2590 events are observed in the \(Z\to e^{+}e^{-}\) event selection, while 3350 events are observed in the \(Z\rightarrow\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\) selection. The kinematic distributions are shown in Figs. 5-11 for both \(Z\to e^{+}e^{-}\) and \(Z\rightarrow\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\). The differences in \(Z\) boson rapidity between electron and muon channels are related to the differences in lepton acceptance.

Background contributions from electroweak boson and top quark production are estimated from Monte Carlo simulations. All expected distributions are normalised to the integrated luminosity of the data set. The multijet background in the \(Z\rightarrow\ell^{+}\ell^{-}\) selection is expected to be negligible, and it is not included.

Systematic uncertainties are calculated for the same components as for the \(W\) boson selection. The combined uncertainties are included in the following histograms as a shaded band.

## 6 \(Z\)+jets signature results

An analysis of jet production in association with \(Z\) bosons follows the methods used in previous ATLAS results at \(\sqrt{s}=7\,\mathrm{TeV}\)[26]. The event selections and background estimation methods are the same as for the inclusive selection. The jet counting includes only anti-\(k_{t}\) jets with \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>30\,\mathrm{GeV}\) and \(|y|<2.5\). Jets are requested to be separated by \(\Delta\mathrm{R}>0.4\) from any selected lepton. Contributions from pileup events are suppressed by requiring a large value of the jet-vertex tagger likelihood [27] for jets with \(p_{\mathrm{T}}<50\,\mathrm{GeV}\) and \(|\eta|<2.4\). The likelihood includes information on the fraction of a jet's tracks or transverse momentum associated with the primary vertex.

The relatively small cross section for \(Z\)+jets production leads to large statistical uncertainties in the \(6.4\,\mathrm{pb}^{-1}\) data set, especially for high jet multiplicity. The results in a larger data set, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of \(78\,\mathrm{pb}^{-1}\), are compared with the prediction from Sherpa for \(Z\)+jets. The comparisons are shown in Figs. 12 and 13. All background contributions are estimated from simulated samples.

Luminosity uncertainties are not included.

## 7 Conclusion

The early 2015 \(pp\) data at \(\sqrt{s}=13\,\mathrm{TeV}\) collected by the ATLAS experiment already provide an excellent opportunity to identify and study \(W\) and \(Z\) boson production. In a data set corresponding to an integrated luminosity of \(6.4\,\mathrm{pb}^{-1}\), the kinematic distributions of \(W\) and \(Z\) production, along with associated jets in a significantly larger sample, highlight the performance of the ATLAS experiment and, within still sizable uncertainties, agree with Standard Model calculations.
