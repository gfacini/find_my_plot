**Abstract**

An evaluation of the correlations between ATLAS and CMS jet energy scale uncertainties is presented for \(\sqrt{s}=8\) TeV \(pp\) collisions recorded in 2012. Uncertainties within each experiment are grouped based on the general type of systematic effect they are intended to cover and the means by which they are derived. Inter-experimental correlation value ranges are established for each corresponding group of uncertainty components. This correlation range is intended to cover the possible correlation values when performing combinations between the two experiments, where the most conservative value obtained from scanning over the correlation range should be used for the final combined measurement. The procedure described here is primarily aimed at single-observable analyses, and has limitations when applied to multi-observable measurements.

## 1 Introduction

The uncertainty on the jet energy scale (JES) is the dominant uncertainty for many physics measurements involving jets. The precision of such measurements can be improved by combining the individual results from different experiments, but such combinations are only possible if the correlations of the uncertainties between the experiments are known. This document represents a joint effort by the ATLAS and CMS collaborations to understand these inter-experimental correlations in detail for \(\sqrt{s}=8\)\(\mathrm{Te\kern-1.0ptV}\) proton-proton \(pp\) collisions, and is published as a common note. It continues the work previously done for jets from \(\sqrt{s}=7\)\(\mathrm{Te\kern-1.0ptV}\)\(pp\) collisions [1] and used, for example, in LHC and LHC+Tevatron combinations of top-quark mass [2, 3].

Dedicated studies have been performed by both ATLAS and CMS in order to derive highly specialized JES calibrations and associated uncertainties. The details of these procedures are reported in the respective documents [4, 5]. The baseline jet reconstruction methods used by the two experiments are rather different: the jets used in most ATLAS physics analyses are built based on energy deposits in the calorimeter [4], while a particle-flow algorithm is widely used by CMS [6]. However, for physics analyses these differences are largely removed by applying JES derived from detailed detector simulation (MC2-based JES). Some residual differences arise from imperfections in the detector simulations and modelling of the jet fragmentation.

Both experiments use data-driven _in situ_ methods where jets balance well-calibrated objects to verify the MC-based JES, determine residual correction factors to mitigate residual imperfections of the simulation, and derive the corresponding uncertainties [4, 5]. The JES uncertainties at ATLAS and CMS cover the transition from reconstructed to particle level jets. Particle level jets are built using standard jet clustering algorithms on simulated particles with an average lifetime longer than 10 ps as generated from the MC, excluding muons and neutrinos in the ATLAS case. CMS includes muons in order to be best adapted to the reconstructed particle-flow jets. While neutrinos and muons have a negligible contribution for the samples used in _in situ_ methods and for deriving MC-based JES for the inclusive jet sample, they contribute a significant fraction of the particle-level energy for jets containing semileptonic decays of heavy quarks.

The level of correlation among the uncertainties of the JES calibrations for the two experiments can be evaluated under a reasonable set of assumptions, as was previously done for jets from \(\sqrt{s}=7\)\(\mathrm{Te\kern-1.0ptV}\)\(pp\) collisions [1]. The cross-experiment correlations were mainly found to come from two sources: inherent biases in the _in situ_ methods arising in particular from modelling of initial and final state radiation, and modelling of the jet fragmentation for various parton flavors, in particular those of \(b\) jets and gluon jets. Following the recommendations of that document, the ATLAS and CMS experiments have focused on aligning and improving their respective methods of assigning systematic uncertainties, in order to better evaluate the correlation from these main sources.

This document reports the updated findings, but also describes other sources of uncertainty in detail similar to those described in the previous note, in order to function as a stand-alone reference for \(\sqrt{s}=8\)\(\mathrm{Te\kern-1.0ptV}\) combinations of ATLAS and CMS measurements. Technical information is given for implementing the uncertainty combinations for single-observable analyses like the top quark mass, for which this correlation analysis is mainly targeted. The limitations for combination of multi-observable measurements like e.g. differential cross sections are outlined and the main targets for potential future improvements are also discussed.

## 2 Summary of the ATLAS JES Uncertainties

A detailed description of the ATLAS JES calibration and uncertainties at \(\sqrt{s}=8\) TeV can be found elsewhere [7, 8, 9, 10, 11]. The calibration proceeds in steps, starting with the _origin correction_ which adjusts the axis of the jet to point back to the reconstructed vertex (origin) of the hard scatter interaction of interest rather than the nominal interaction point. The next step corrects for the additional energy in the jet cone, due to pileup interactions. The procedure subtracts additional energy due to pileup interactions on an event-by-event, jet-by-jet basis through an average event density and jet area correction as described in Ref. [11]. This is followed by the application of an additional pileup offset correction which removes the remaining dependence on \(N_{\mathrm{PV}}\), the number of reconstructed primary vertices, and \(\langle\mu\rangle\), the average number of collisions per bunch crossing, for the average event. A MC-based JES correction derived from inclusive jet samples is subsequently applied in order to correct the average jet energy from the reconstructed scale to the particle scale [9]. Additional detector properties such as the track multiplicity, energy deposited in a given layer of the calorimeter, and number of segments in the muon system behind the jet are then used via the _global sequential calibration_[10] to reduce dependencies on jet flavour, improve the jet energy resolution, and correct for jets which are not contained within (punch-through) the ATLAS calorimeters.

Then a series of residual corrections, derived using _in situ_ techniques, are applied in order to remove remaining differences between data and MC. All _in situ_ techniques rely on balancing a well-known reference object against a probe jet, thus allowing for the derivation of the residual correction and corresponding systematic uncertainties. The _in situ_ balance techniques used by ATLAS are listed below in the order they are derived.

1. **Dijet \(\eta\)-intercalibration**: set the relative scale of jets throughout the ATLAS detector through the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\)-balance of events in a dijet topology, where one is in a well-understood region (the reference jet) and the other is in a region to study (the probe jet). In the traditional method, a central reference jet within \(|\eta|<0.8\) is identified, and then a probe jet is taken from \(0.8<|\eta|<4.5\). The \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) balance between the reference and probe jet is then used to calibrate the forward region with respect to the central one. This traditional method is now used as a cross-check to the _matrix method_, which defines multiple reference regions to balance forward probe jets, thus increasing the available statistics [8].
2. **Z-jet and \(\gamma\)-jet balance**: set the absolute scale of central probe jets within \(|\eta|<0.8\) by balancing against either a **Z** boson (decaying to electron/muon pairs) or a photon as the reference object with a well-reconstructed energy. This calibrates the probe jet at low to medium-high energies (\(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) of roughly 20 to 700 GeV), where sufficient statistics are available for such processes. In addition, rather than directly balancing the probe jet with the reference object, the Missing Projection Fraction (MPF) method is also studied. In the MPF approach, the entire hadronic recoil system is used to balance the **Z** or \(\gamma\) rather than the single jet, and thus the method is more sensitive to the calorimeter response. This method also takes into account out-of-cone radiation, and thus is more robust against pileup interactions and the underlying event. The direct balance and MPF methods are sensitive to different systematic effects, and both are studied. Ultimately the direct balance method is used to derive the calibration and systematic uncertainties for **Z**-jet events, while the MPF approach is used for \(\gamma\)-jet events [7].
3. **Multi-jet balance**: set the absolute scale of central probe jets within \(|\eta|<0.8\) by balancing against a recoil system of multiple lower-energy jets which have been previously calibrated by the **Z**-jet or\(\gamma\)-jet balance methods. This calibrates the probe jet at a given higher energy scale. This procedure can be iterated, as what was previously a probe jet becomes a reference jet, and thus the procedure can be repeated to reach higher energies so long as sufficient statistics are available [8].

As mentioned, the latter two processes adjust the absolute \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) of central jets, and thus are known as _absolute balance_ techniques. The two absolute balance techniques are further combined to improve the residual calibration and reduce uncertainties when multiple _in situ_ methods overlap within a given region of \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\)[9]. The first method calibrates jets with respect to each other, and thus is often known as a _relative balance_ technique.

The uncertainties associated with the _in situ_ methods are listed in Table 1. Each uncertainty is linked to a category that describes the general source of the uncertainty:

* Detector description (det.),
* Physics modeling (model),
* Mixed, including both detector description and physics modeling (mixed),
* Methodology and statistics (stat./meth.).

The evaluation of the systematic uncertainties associated with the _in situ_ methods results in a long list, with only a few representing the dominant contribution to the overall uncertainty. It is thus preferable for use in parametrized likelihood fits to represent the full set of sources with a reduced set of Nuisance Parameters (NPs). This approach used by ATLAS preserves the total uncertainty while significantly reducing the number of components with only minor losses in the full correlation matrix [9].

The first step of the reduction procedure is the construction of a covariance matrix from the independent (uncorrelated) absolute _in situ_ balance uncertainties, where each component is parametrized solely in \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\). An eigenvector decomposition is then performed, resulting in a new set of uncertainty components which are linear combinations of the original uncertainties. In order to retain the same total uncertainty and minimize the amount of correlation information which is lost in the procedure, the \(N\) dominant eigenvectors with the largest uncertainty eigenvalues are retained. The sub-dominant eigenvectors are combined in quadrature to form a single residual term, thus reducing the initial set of uncertainty components into a set of \(N+1\) components. The correlation matrix formed by this new set of uncertainty components is subtracted from the original correlation matrix, and the value of \(N\) is changed until the desired level of correlation information is retained.

This procedure has been applied to the full set of absolute _in situ_ balance components, requesting only the \(N=5\) dominant eigenvectors and adding the remaining components into a residual term. In this scenario, the amount of correlation information lost, defined by the maximum difference between the full and reduced correlation matrices, is at the percent-level. The same approach has also been applied to each of the four categories of absolute _in situ_ uncertainties, thus retaining knowledge of the general source of the reduced components. The reduction procedure when applied to each general source of systematic uncertainties results in large number of components compared to when applied to the full set of systematic uncertainties. However, retention of the information of the systematic uncertainty source is critical when combinations of the ATLAS and CMS results are performed. For this reason, only the full representation listed in Table 1 or the reduction-per-category representation are recommended for ATLAS measurements which intend to combine their results with other experiments.

Table 1: Summary of the uncertainty components associated with the _in situ_ methods used to either correct the absolute jet energy scale in the central region (**Z**-jet, \(\gamma\)-jet and multi-jet balance) or calibrate forward regions of the detector with respect to reference regions (\(\eta\)-intercalibration). Each uncertainty component is categorized depending on its source as either: detector (**det.**), physics modeling (**model**), mixed detector and modeling (**mixed**), or as statistics and method (**stat./meth.**). These uncertainty components are discussed in more detail in Refs. [7, 8].

Beyond the aforementioned _in situ_ balance uncertainties, there are several other ATLAS JES systematic uncertainties to consider. These are summarized in Table 2 and briefly described below. Most of the additional components are assigned a general source as above, although some fall outside of these four classifications.

* **High-\(p_{\mathrm{T}}\)**: an uncertainty on jets with a \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) above the reach of the multi-jet balance _in situ_ technique, evaluated from propagating the single hadron response (as measured from 2009-2011 data, complimented with test beam data) for each hadron within simulated jets. The source of this uncertainty falls in the detector description category.
* **Flavor composition and response**: a pair of uncertainties covering the difference between the topology of interest and the topology used to derive the absolute _in situ_ balance calibration, which is assumed to be purely light quarks. The flavour composition uncertainty is derived from the fraction of gluons \(f_{g}\) and light quarks \(1-f_{g}\) and their corresponding responses \(\mathcal{R}_{g}\) and \(\mathcal{R}_{q}\) as measured in Pythia8[12], quantified as \(\Delta f_{g}\frac{|\mathcal{R}_{q}-\mathcal{R}_{g}|}{f_{g}\mathcal{R}_{g}+(1 -f_{g})\mathcal{R}_{q}}\). The flavour response uncertainty is derived from the difference in the gluon response between Pythia and Herwig++[13], where this difference is multiplied by the fraction of gluons in the topology, \(f_{g}\Delta\mathcal{R}_{g}\). More details on both procedures are available in Ref. [4]. The sources of both uncertainties fall in the physics modeling category.
* **Response of jets containing \(b\)-hadrons (\(b\)-jets)**: an uncertainty covering the difference in response for \(b\)-jets between Pythia8 and Herwig++. The source of this uncertainty falls in the physics modeling category.
* **Closure of the calibration**: an uncertainty covering the difference between full simulation (Geant) and fast simulation (detector parametrization) samples. The _in situ_ uncertainties are derived using the full simulation samples, and thus the term is zero when using full simulation jets, as the systematic effects have already been covered. Fast simulation samples have a different scale that must be accounted for, thus an uncertainty taken from the difference between fast and full simulation is added. The source of this uncertainty does not fall in any of the previously defined categories.
* **Pileup**: an uncertainty covering any residual dependencies of the JES on pileup-related parameters, most notably the number of primary vertices \(N_{\mathrm{PV}}\), the average number of collisions per bunch crossing \(\langle\mu\rangle\), and the average pileup energy density in the calorimeter \(\rho\). The dependence on \(N_{\mathrm{PV}}\) and \(\langle\mu\rangle\) is split into three components, corresponding to the differential \(N_{\mathrm{PV}}\) and \(\langle\mu\rangle\) dependence, and estimated from _in situ_ studies. The fourth component is measured in multiple different topologies of MC samples produced by Pythia, where the largest difference between samples is taken as a topology uncertainty on \(\rho\). All of the components are parametrized in \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) and \(\eta\). These uncertainties depend on a variety of sources and factors making them harder to categorize, and thus they do not fall in any of the previously defined categories.
* **Non-contained jets**: a residual uncertainty to cover for the application of a correction for jets which punch-through the calorimeter, which was derived from simulation and applied in both data and MC. The uncertainty is measured _in situ_ and applied when using full simulation samples. The correction is not applicable to fast simulation samples due to limitations of the detector parametrization, and thus the associated uncertainty is zero for this scenario. The source of this uncertainty falls in the detector description category.

## 3 Summary of the CMS JES Uncertainties

A detailed description of the CMS JES calibration and uncertainties at \(\sqrt{s}=\)8  is provided in Ref. [14]. The calibration proceeds in steps by first subtracting offset from in and out of time pileup, then correcting the jet from the reconstructed scale to the particle scale with MC-based JES, and finally correcting the jet scale for residual differences between data and simulation. These techniques are listed below in order of their application.

1. Pileup offset subtraction: The offset subtraction uses the jet-by-jet based area correction [15] in a modified form \(\rho_{\mathrm{eff}}\times A_{\mathrm{jet}}\), where the effective pileup energy density \(\rho_{\mathrm{eff}}\) within a jet at given jet \(\eta\) and \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) is determined relative to the global event energy density \(\rho\) by comparing the jet \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) in simulation with and without pileup overlay. This accounts for the underlying event and various non-linear effects such as calorimeter zero suppression. The residual data/simulation differences in offset versus \(\eta\) are calibrated by comparing \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) offsets in Minimum Bias data and simulation.
2. MC-based JES: The MC-based JES is derived from QCD dijet samples with pileup overlay re-weighted to match data and with pileup offset subtraction applied, to absorb any residual effects from offset subtraction. The results are also checked versus MC-based JES derived from the same samples without pileup overlay. The corrections are determined as a function of jet \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) and \(\eta\) based on the ratio of average reconstructed jet \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) to particle level jet \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\). The particle level jet \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) excludes neutrinos.
3. Residual corrections: The residual corrections are derived in two parts using data-driven _in situ_ methods, first for jet scale relative to barrel (\(|\eta|<1.3\)) using dijet events, and then for absolute jet scale in barrel using a global fit to a combination of \(\mathbf{Z}\)-jet, \(\gamma\)-jet, and multi-jet events.

\end{table}
Table 2: Summary of the uncertainty components in addition to those belonging to _in situ_ absolute or relative balance techniques in ATLAS. Each uncertainty component is also categorized depending on its source as either: detector (det.), physics modeling (model), mixed detector and modeling (mixed), or as statistics and method (stat./meth.). In this case, no components fall under the mixed or stat./meth. categories. Uncertainties not belonging to any of the four categories are labeled as special. Pileup uncertainties are described in Ref. [11], the punch-through uncertainty is detailed in Ref. [10], and the rest of the uncertainties are explained in Ref. [4].

* Dijet \(\eta\) intercalibration: The dijet balance uses the MPF method for the central value to reduce sensitivity to bias from soft radiation, with extrapolation to zero additional jet activity to remove any remaining bias. The results are cross-checked versus the balance method, also using extrapolation, and the uncertainties include the closure of the method when comparing results based on Pythia and Herwig. The dijet correction is a function of both \(\eta\) and \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\), with the dependence assumed log-linear and capped beyond the range of direct dijet measurements. The leading uncertainties are the shape of the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\)-dependent parameterization and statistical uncertainty at \(|\eta|>3\).
* Global fit of absolute JES: The global fit to \(\mathbf{Z}\)-jet, \(\gamma\)-jet and multi-jet samples uses a combination of MPF and \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) balance methods. The fit considers nuisance parameters from reference object scales (photons, electrons and muons) as well as from additional soft radiation in the event and residual reference objects footprints in \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\) for the MPF method. The two-parameter global fit versus \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) considers the leading effect on PF reconstruction from variation in the barrel (\(|\eta|<1.3\)) hadron calorimeter (HCAL) scale, in addition to a single global scale factor. The leading uncertainties are unobserved neutrinos in jets, momentum lost outside detector acceptance of \(|\eta|<5\), and the statistical fit uncertainty in the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\)-dependent parameter.

The systematic uncertainties associated with the calibration are provided in the form of mutually uncorrelated signed components. Each uncertainty component corresponds to a one standard deviation systematic shift fully correlated in \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) and \(\eta\). For systematic uncertainties that are uncorrelated between different subdetector regions, separate uncertainty components are provided, each applicable in a limited \(\eta\) range.

The quadratic sum of all individual components adds up to the total JES uncertainty.

The JES uncertainties are listed in Table 3  and classified in four broad classes: pileup offset, relative calibration of the jet energy scale versus \(\eta\), and absolute energy scale versus \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\). In addition, an uncertainty regarding the flavor response modeling and an uncertainty to cover variations in the detector conditions over time due to residual effects after correcting for radiation damage are considered.

There are two uncertainty components considered for the pileup offset, most relevant at low \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\). The main systematic uncertainty PileUpPt comes from the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\)-dependent difference between the true offset and the random cone offset in simulation. The _in situ_ measurements of the response are used to estimate the remaining residual pileup uncertainty after application of the residual corrections. A residual uncertainty on the \(\eta\)-dependent scale factor is estimated by varying the energy density \(\rho\) within one standard deviation (PileUpDataMC).

For the relative jet calibration using dijet events, the uncertainty on the jet energy resolution in data is propagated to the measurement and taken into account as uncertainty RelativeJER.

Due to high trigger thresholds and prescales, statistical uncertainties in the determination of the relative scale in data using dijet events are dominant at high \(|\eta|\). The uncertainty related to the correction for final-state radiation (RelativeFSR) takes into account differences in the resulting residual corrections when either using or as reference MC. The \(\eta\)-dependent correction is parameterized with a log-linear function versus \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) for \(|\eta|<3.0\), and as a constant in the Hadronic Forward (HF) calorimeter (\(3\leq|\eta|<5.2\)). The uncertainty in the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\)-dependent shape of the data/MC ratio (RelativePt) is bound by half the difference of the log-linear and constant fits.

The following absolute scale uncertainties cover for the extrapolation to high and low \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) outside of the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\)-range directly accessible using direct measurements. The uncertainties for constant absolute scale (AbsoluteScale, AbsoluteStat) and \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\)-dependent scale (SinglePionHCAL) are extracted from a global fit 

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{l|l} \hline Name & Description \\ \hline

Table 3: Summary of the uncertainty components for the _in situ_ techniques as well as uncertainties determined directly from simulation in CMS. A short description is given for each uncertainty component. Some uncertainty components are provided separately for subdetector regions and have to be evaluated individually. The main regions are the barrel (BB: \(|\eta|<1.3\)), endcap with tracking coverage (EC1: \(1.3<|\eta|<2.5\)), endcap outside tracking coverage (EC2: \(2.5<|\eta|<3.0\)) and hadron forward (HF: \(3.0<|\eta|<5.2\). )to Z-jet, \(\gamma\)-jet, and multi-jet data. The global fit has two degrees of freedom, one for fitting the absolute scale and one for fitting \(p_{\rm T}\) dependence under the assumption that the shape of the response variation is consistent with the one caused by a constant shift in single-pion response in HCAL. The functional form used to fit the \(p_{\rm T}\) dependence contains a reference momentum chosen as \(p_{\rm T}\) = 208 GeV to minimize the correlation of the parameters for the absolute scale and the \(p_{\rm T}\)-dependence. An additional constant scale uncertainty is added for the shared biases of the MPF and \(p_{\rm T}\) balance methods (AbsoluteMPFBias) coming from neutrinos produced in jets and ISR+FSR outside of detector acceptance. As both methods are affected in a very similar way, these nuisances can not be effectively removed by the global fit. Additional shape uncertainties for \(p_{\rm T}\) dependence are considered from the following sources relative to the global fit reference momentum: Single charged pion response in ECAL (SinglePionECAL, propagating a \(\pm 3\%\) uncertainty on the single pion response as determined from early 2010 data to the overall jet response using simulation) and jet response differences due to the different fragmentation models implemented in Pythia or Herwig++ (Fragmentation).

The flavor response differences are estimated using simulation, and the b-jet scale is cross-checked with Z+\(b\)-jet events. The initial flavor response uncertainties are evaluated using Pythia and Herwig++ differences for pure flavors. Because the data-driven calibrations absorb some of the flavor response differences for the reference mixtures (dijet, \(\gamma\)-jet and Z-jet), the initial flavor uncertainties are propagated through the data-driven calibration chain. This reduces e.g. the \(\gamma\)-jet flavor mixture uncertainty in the barrel, and the dijet flavor mixture uncertainty relative to the barrel region. As a result, the flavor uncertainties are minimized for these flavor mixtures. The flavor differences in Pythia and Herwig++ are largest for gluon jets, while the two simulations agree well on both light and heavy quark jets. Observed time-dependent variations of the detector response not fully compensated by the low-level reconstruction are considered as Time uncertainty.

For combinations with other experiments it is recommended to evaluate all the uncertainty components listed in Table 3 individually. Some of the components are provided separately for subdetector regions and have to be varied independently (exact technical labels of all individual components are given in the text, summarized in Table 3 and used in Table 4).

## 4 Correlations between ATLAS and CMS JES uncertainty components

In order to combine the results of precision measurements conducted by the ATLAS and CMS experiments, the level of correlation between the two sets of uncertainties must be quantified. The JES uncertainty is typically a large systematic uncertainty for many combinations of interest, particularly when working with top quark measurements. As was previously done for the JES correlations between analyses conducted at \(\sqrt{s}=7\) TeV [1], a dedicated inter-experimental discussion has been held. The outcome of the previous effort has been revised for \(\sqrt{s}=8\) TeV combinations following changes in the procedures used by both collaborations. It is important to remember that correlations are primarily driven by the shapes of the uncertainty components and the methods used to derive them, not by their magnitudes. Following these guidelines, several correlation groups between ATLAS and CMS have been identified, as outlined below.

1. **Statistical and detector-based uncertainties from _in situ_ techniques**: both the MC and data used by ATLAS and CMS are statistically distinct, and different detector technologies are used, thus these types of uncertainties are **uncorrelated** between the two experiments. This also holds for the statistical uncertainty associated with the dijet \(\eta\)-intercalibration method used by both experiments.

2. **Modeling uncertainties from _in situ_ techniques**: at \(\sqrt{s}=8\) TeV, both ATLAS and CMS make use of **Z**-jet balance, \(\gamma\)-jet balance, and multi-jet balance _in situ_ techniques. While ATLAS and CMS measure similar systematic effects (e.g. neutrinos produced in jets, out-of-cone effects, and detector acceptance to additional radiation), their impact has some dependence on the detector itself and other choices (e.g. treatment of muons in jets, jet radius, and methods to correct for additional radiation). Furthermore, ATLAS performs a \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\)-dependent combination between the three techniques bin-by-bin, while CMS uses a global fit to a two-parameter function. There are thus both similarities and differences between the approach used by the two experiments, and thus the relevant uncertainties are treated as being **partially correlated**.
3. **Relative \(\eta\)-intercalibration modeling uncertainty**: both experiments make use of the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) balance of dijet events to calibrate jets across \(\eta\) with respect to a well understood reference region. The relative calibration is sensitive to radiation modeling, and both experiments use a difference between generators with different radiation patterns as a source of systematic uncertainty. CMS compares Pythia and Herwig++ before extrapolating to zero radiation to derive their uncertainty. ATLAS also tried an extrapolation to zero radiation, but found that it had negligible effect when comparing Powheg+Pythia against Sherpa (as opposed to Pythia against Herwig++), and thus removed it. Given that the similar generators and techniques are used in both ATLAS and CMS, the resulting uncertainty is expected to be highly correlated, although there are some expected decorrelations from differences in the analysis procedure. As such, the uncertainty is treated as being **mostly correlated**.
4. \(g\)**-jet (gluon initiated jet) fragmentation energy scale uncertainty**: the modeling of radiation patterns for \(g\)-jets is less robust than that of other partons, leading to larger uncertainties on the associated energy scale. ATLAS and CMS derive an uncertainty from the difference between Pythia and Herwig++, which is then further weighted by the number of gluon events (ATLAS) or propagated through relevant topologies (CMS). Given that the same generator difference is used, and then evaluated in a given topology (for a given gluon fraction), they are expected to be strongly correlated. This, combined with the nearly identical resulting uncertainty between experiments when propagated across both \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) and \(\eta\), as shown in Fig. 1, led to the decision fo the components to be taken as **fully correlated**.
5. \(b\)**-jet (bottom-quark initiated jet) fragmentation energy scale uncertainty**: jets containing \(b\)-hadrons exhibit a different detector response than that of light quark jets, but are also more easily identifiable due to the presence of displaced vertices and different radiation patterns. As a result, both ATLAS and CMS provide \(b\)-jet specific uncertainties, which are derived from differences between Pythia and Herwig++. However, it should be noted that the JES uncertainties only cover the transition to particle level jets as discussed in Section 1. For analyses taking the parton level as reference, additional analysis-specific \(b\)-parton uncertainties may apply that can be cross-checked e.g. with _in situ_**Z+\(b\)**-jet measurement. While both experiments find that their MC lacks statistics for a full parametrization of the uncertainty across \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) and \(\eta\), ATLAS takes it to vary with \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) and to be flat in \(\eta\) while CMS uses the opposite choice. There are substantial similarities in the approach used, but there are also differences which will add decorrelations, thus the components are treated as **mostly correlated**.
6. **Other jet fragmentation energy scale uncertainties**: the \(g\)-jet and \(b\)-jet energy scale uncertainties have already been addressed above, leaving the \(u\)/\(d\)/\(s\)/\(c\) quarks to be discussed. ATLAS assumes that the _in situ_ techniques calibrate jets to the light quark scale, and that any residual differences between light quark flavours are covered by the larger gluon energy scale uncertainties. The fraction of light quarks is then combined with the difference between light quark and gluon responses as measured in Pythia, giving a residual uncertainty. CMS labels jets based on the matching parton flavor, and provides scale uncertainties comparing Pythia and Herwig++ similar to what is done for the gluon term separately for \(u/d/s\) as opposed to \(c\)-jets. The ATLAS and CMS techniques are thus unrelated, and in fact are not directly comparable, thus the uncertainties are taken to be **uncorrelated**.
7. **Pileup uncertainties**: Both experiments subtract pileup using a variant of the FastJet area pileup subtraction Ref. [15]. The leading pileup uncertainty at CMS comes from the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\)-dependent difference in pileup offset inside and outside of jets, whose magnitude is estimated using simulation and which is partly absorbed in the data-driven corrections with \(\mathbf{Z}/\gamma\)+jet and dijet events. A smaller contribution comes from the uncertainty in the eta-dependent data/simulation scale factor for offset. ATLAS evaluates the uncertainty into four parts, three of which are derived _in situ_ in units of \(N_{\mathrm{PV}}\) and/or \(\langle\mu\rangle\), while the fourth is derived from the difference in the average event density \(\rho\) as measured in different simulated topologies. While the pileup suppression procedure itself is similar, the means of deriving pileup uncertainties differs dramatically. As such, the pileup uncertainties are taken to be **uncorrelated**.
8. **High-\(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) uncertainties**: the methodology and test beam energies used to derive the high-\(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) uncertainties vary between experiments, thus they are taken to be **uncorrelated**.
9. **Other uncertainties**: there are a small number of remaining uncertainty sources evaluated in one experiment but not the other. Any such uncertainties are taken to be **uncorrelated** between ATLAS and CMS.

Within each of these correlation groups, the uncertainties for a given experiment should first be combined into one component. This resulting component for each experiment should then be correlated between experiments within a range which will be defined below. Note that this approach based on the merging

Figure 1: ATLAS and CMS gluon-jet energy scale uncertainties (a) as a function of \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) for fixed \(|\eta|=0\) and (b) as a function of \(\eta\) for fixed \(p_{\mathrm{T}}=100\GeV\). A very strong similarity is observed between the ATLAS and CMS uncertainties across \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) and within \(|\eta|\lesssim 3.2\), the most important region for most ATLAS+CMS combinations which are sensitive to the JES, thus strengthening the assumption that they are fully correlated. The difference for \(|\eta|\gtrsim 3.2\) is understood to be the result of a combination of factors, and lies beyond the primary regime of interest of this note.

of uncertainties within groups induces a loss of information on the correlations between different phase-space regions within a given measurement. Therefore, the method is well adapted for combinations of single observable measurements, with further developments being necessary for combinations of multi-observable results (e.g. differential cross sections).

While similar methods for calibration may be used by ATLAS and CMS, there are often small differences in the evaluation of the systematic uncertainties. It is difficult to quantify the impact of such differences, and thus a range of possible correlations is necessary to define a realistic and conservative correlation range. A scan should be performed over this range of correlation values in order to determine the most conservative result, which should then be quoted as the final combined measurement. The endpoints of the correlation ranges are arbitrary, and thus an analysis that sees large differences when scanning over the correlation range (particularly near one of the extremes of the window) should extend the endpoint and perform more detailed studies.

The associated correlation ranges for these correlations groups are listed below.

1. **Uncorrelated uncertainties**: correlations between ATLAS and CMS are fixed at 0%. * Statistical and detector-related uncertainty components * Fragmentation-related terms not in other correlation groups * Pileup uncertainty components * High-\(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) uncertainty components * Single-experiment uncertainty components
2. **Partially correlated uncertainties**: correlations between ATLAS and CMS are varied between 0% and 50%. * _In situ_ absolute balance modeling uncertainty components (**Z**-jet, \(\gamma\)-jet, and multi-jet balance)
3. **Mostly correlated uncertainties**: correlations between ATLAS and CMS are varied between 50% and 100%. * _In situ_ relative balance modeling components (\(\eta\)-intercalibration) * \(b\)-jet fragmentation energy scale uncertainty
4. **Fully correlated uncertainties**: correlations between ATLAS and CMS are fixed at 100%. * \(g\)-jet fragmentation energy scale uncertainty

The above list should not be compressed into four uncertainty components based on the four correlation ranges, as this will discard important shape information. Instead, each sub-point above should be retained as a separate input to the combination. A summary of this information, including the mapping from individual ATLAS and CMS uncertainty sources to the combination-oriented component groups listed above, is provided in Table 4.

## 5 Conclusion and outlook

As a result of the detailed comparison of the procedures to determine the jet energy calibration and its uncertainties in ATLAS and CMS at \(\sqrt{s}=8\,\mathrm{TeV}\), a good understanding of the JES correlations between both experiments has been achieved. The associated correlation ranges for the correlations groups proposed in Section 4 provide the current best estimate of these correlations and are useful for combinations of precision measurements. This procedure is primarily intended for single-observable measurements, such as mass and total cross-section measurements, but has limitations for combinations of multi-observable results, such as differential cross-section measurements.

A few points stand out as areas of potential improvement. If both experiments adhere to the following principles in future datasets, then the level of correlation between the experiments will be more clearly defined, ultimately improving the ease and power of combinations. At the same time, these considerations must be balanced by the need for an experiment to independently obtain the best possible results.

1. The procedure for estimating flavor uncertainties could be homogenized in order to narrow the range of correlation. Furthermore, their parametrization could depend first on \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\), and preferably also on \(\eta\) (possibly in large bins) so long as sufficient statistics are available.
2. The flavour uncertainties associated with the \(b\)-quark energy scale are particularly important for top-quark measurement combinations, and the magnitude of generator differences varies between experiments. Rather than rely on MC differences, _in situ_ studies could be used when possible. If statistics are insufficient for a proper _in situ_ measurement, then additional MC studies such as correcting \(b\)-hadron decay branching fractions and tuning \(b\)-jet fragmentation could be useful in more accurately estimating this uncertainty.
3. Pileup uncertainties could cover differences related to the topology dependence of the underlying event. The _in situ_ techniques used to quantify pileup uncertainties and the parametrization thereof could be harmonized if possible.
4. The approach to the derivation of the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\)-extrapolation uncertainties could be homogenized between the two experiments. In particular, there could be well-motivated uncertainties for the single particle propagation of jets with \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) beyond the reach of _in situ_ techniques, using calorimeter knowledge and test-beam data.
5. The procedure for combining the different \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\)-dependent _in situ_ balance methods could be harmonized between experiments.

The procedures followed by ATLAS and CMS are closer at \(\sqrt{s}=8\,\mathrm{TeV}\) than they were in the past [1]. With continued discussion and further improvements to the methods used to derive JES central values and uncertainties, both the total uncertainties and the correlation ranges can be further reduced, thus strengthening future combinations and expanding the measurement potential of the ATLAS and CMS experiments.
