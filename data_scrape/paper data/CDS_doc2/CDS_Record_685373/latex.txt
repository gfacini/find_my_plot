Introduction

Radiations are a major concern for LHC experiments and all ATLAS subsystems must be suitably tested to ensure a stable and reliable working of the detector. Radiation tests to qualify the HV distributor of the Tilecal were already performed [1][2] but one was missing to be fully complete with respect to ATLAS rules[3]: the Non Ionising Energy Loss (NIEL) test.

Atomic displacements are the main result of particles (such as protons, neutrons or ions) producing NIEL [4]: collisions in cascade on atoms from semiconductor lattice create defects (such as vacancies) along the tracks of secondary particles and in clusters at the end of the tracks. The possible effects on carriers (in a semiconductor for instance) can be a decrease of the lifetime or the mobility. The global effect on a given component is a variation of its response (decrease of the gain for an optocoupler for instance).

The NIEL sensitive components of the High Voltage Distributor system of the TileCal were irradiated at Prospero (Dijon-France) on december 6, 2001 to evaluate the effect of low -energy neutrons on their behaviour. This note reports the doses applied, the results obtained and the conclusions infered.

## 2 Doses applied and components tested

Recently simulations[1][7] (performed in november 2001 but public in february 2002) were made for the whole ATLAS detector subdivided in elementary domains of 10x10 cm\({}^{2}\) each. Taking safety factors into account (uncertainties from the simulation and variation of radiation tolerance from lot to lot for electronic components), one can estimate the doses for ten years of ATLAS operations at any location of the HV distributor system (see figure 1). Explicit numbers are given in table 1 (the precise position of the cards in the detector is taken into account). The highest doses expected for the barrel part are 9.66e11 \(1MeVeq.n.cm^{-2}\) and 8.06e11 \(1MeVeq.n.cm^{-2}\) for HVmicro and HVopto cards respectively. For what concerns the extended barrel side, one foresees at upmost 3.26e11 \(1MeVeq.n.cm^{-2}\) and 5.32e11 \(1MeVeq.n.cm^{-2}\) for HVmicro and HVopto cards respectively. At the time of the tests, the highest expected NIEL doses for the HV distributor system were 8.7e11(Z=210 cm) and 6.56e11 (Z=200 cm) \(1MeVeq.n.cm^{-2}\) for ten

years of ATLAS operations for HVmicro and HVpoto cards respectively [4] (safety factors included). These doses are 10 to 20 % lower than the new expectations.

Only non CMOS components are sensitive to NIEL [4]. The corresponding list for HVmicro and HVpoto cards is given on table 2. Since we have common components on HVmicro and HVpoto cards and since we wanted to minimize the operation procedure (test and cost), we decided to make ten printed boards, each having all the components given in table 2 and to irradiate all the circuits to the maximal dose foreseen at the time of the tests, ie 8.7e11 \(1MeVeq.n.cm^{-2}\). This corresponds to at least 9 and 10.8 equivalent years of ATLAS operations for HVmicro and HVpoto components respectively (new simulations). A picture of one of the board is given on figure 2.

## 3 Results

All components were tested before and after irradiation: for each, characteristic measurements (such as voltages) corresponding to the working of the component were performed. The components were used in a way similar to the role they have in the HV distributor system. The results obtained were then compared. The conclusions are given in table 3.

The only component outside acceptable limits is the optocoupler MCT2. One observes furthermore that for most of the components the mean differences (between before and after irradiation) are less then 1%. The components that show bigger discrepancies are: MVK100/25 (capacitor), HCPL2611 (saturation voltage), B

BSR18A (saturation voltage), MCT2-DIP (lock and saturation voltages) and MOC8204 (gain). Because of their particular use in the HV distributor system, the last two deserve few comments:

* MCT2-DIP: this component is used in the on/off structure [5] that allows the possibility to switch off half a HVpoto card (thus a quarter of super-drawer). Problems had already been encountered during SEE tests [1] and we then decided to remove this component and to replace it by a MOC8204. MCT2-DIP will thus not be present in ATLAS.
* MOC8204: effect of neutrons on this component seems to be a gain decrease of about 4% on average (ie after more than 10 equivalent years of ATLAS operations). This is too small to affect the working of the HV distributor system [5] especially since MOC8204 are surrounded by other components (such as transistors) in regulation loops. A simple way to check this statement is to put the ten irradiated MOC8204 on a well-working and not irradiated HVpoto card and to look at ouput results of it. This was done on HVpoto card 150-236 and the differences between ADC conversions and regulation loop outputs are given on figure 3. One observes a small effect of radiations: the RMS increases from 0.07 V to 0.1 V after 11.9 equivalent years of ATLAS operations. We are satisfied with this result.

## Conclusions

Non-CMOS components (ten of each type) of the HV distributor system of the Tile calorimeter were irradiated with low-energy neutrons up to a total dose of 8.7e11 \(1MeVeq.n.cm^{-2}\). At the time of the tests (december 6, 2001), it was the highest expected dose in the HV distributor system area, taking all possible safety factors into account, for ten years of ATLAS operations. New simulations (done in november 2001 but official in february 2002) tend to indicate that the new highest doses are 9.66e11 \(1MeVeq.n.cm^{-2}\) and 8.06e11 \(1MeVeq.n.cm^{-2}\) (increase of about 10 to 20 %) for HVmicro and HVpoto cards respectively. It means that the dose applied on our components correspond to at least 9 and 10.8 years of ATLAS operations for HVmicro and HVpoto components respectively. No serious effect was observed on irradiated components: the (small) losses seen on optocouplers \(\mathrm{MOC8204}\) will not be a problem for the working of the High Voltage distributor system of the Tile calorimeter.
