###### Abstract

The electroweak mixing angle is a fundamental parameter in the Standard Model. Precise measurements of the effective weak mixing angle can be used, together with the top quark mass M\({}_{top}\), to put constraints on the Higgs boson mass, similarly to the way it can be done using very high precision W mass measurements - by studying the effects of radiative corrections. At hadron colliders, the effective weak mixing angle (or, to be more precise, the value of \(sin^{2}\Theta_{eff}^{lep}\)) can be measured indirectly using the forward-backward asymmetry (A\({}_{F\,B}\)) in di-lepton production near the Z pole. At LEP, \(sin^{2}\Theta_{eff}^{lep}\) has been measured with a precision of approximately

\[\delta sin^{2}\Theta_{eff}^{lep}=\,2.3\times 10^{-4}.\]

LHC experiments will produce very large numbers of Z bosons and, in principle, one could measure the forward-backward asymmetry and, indirectly, \(sin^{2}\Theta_{eff}^{lep}\) with a very small statistical error. The question whether one can measure the effective weak mixing angle at LHC with precision comparable to, or better than, the LEP result has been investigated in the past[1, 2]. The improvement in the precision of determination of \(sin^{2}\Theta_{eff}^{lep}\) by detecting electrons in in the ATLAS detector up to \(|\eta|<\)4.9 is the subject of this note.

## 2 Past results

In order to be able to translate the measurements of A\({}_{F\,B}\) into the measurement of \(sin^{2}\Theta_{eff}^{lep}\), one must understand the effects of higher order QCD and electroweak radiative corrections. The most important factor determining the precision of the \(sin^{2}\Theta_{eff}^{lep}\) measurement are the values of parameters a and b, which relate[3] the A\({}_{F\,B}\) and \(sin^{2}\Theta_{eff}^{lep}\)

\[A_{F\,B}=b(a-sin^{2}\Theta_{eff}^{lep})\]

The O(\(\alpha\)) QED corrections as well as the O(\(\alpha_{s}\)) QCD corrections to the process \(pp\rightarrow(\gamma^{*}\),\(\not\!\!{Z})\rightarrow(\mu^{+}\mu^{-},e^{+}e^{-})\) were calculated[2]. The authors pointed out that the measured asymmetry in \(pp\) collisions is smaller than in \(p\overline{p}\) collisions at Tevatron, and that the asymmetry and the sensitivity to the effective weak mixing angle increases with rapidity of the di-lepton system. For an integrated luminosity of 100 fb\({}^{-1}\), they estimated that it should be possible to measure \(sin^{2}\Theta_{eff}^{lep}\) with a statistical precision of

\[\delta sin^{2}\Theta_{eff}^{lep}=\,3.9\times 10^{-5}.\]for full rapidity coverage for leptons and

\[\delta sin^{2}\Theta^{lep}_{eff}=4.4\times 10^{-4}.\]

for the more realistic finite lepton rapidity coverage of \(|y_{le\,p}|\)\(<\)2.4. With an additional cut on Z rapidity[4], \(|y_{Z}|\)\(>\)1, they have found that the precision could be improved by an additional 10%. The next-to-leading order QCD and QED radiative corrections were taken into account. Events with di-lepton masses in the range 75 GeV-105 GeV/c\({}^{2}\) were selected as Z candidates for the above estimates.

## 3 Rapidity coverage of the ATLAS detector for electrons

The nominal rapidity coverage used for precision physics (e.g. electron and photon identification) in the ATLAS detector is in the range \(|y|\)\(<\)2.5, which corresponds to the region equipped with the inner detector and where the electromagnetic calorimeter has the best granularity. Since the sensitivity of the asymmetry measurement increases at large rapidity, we have studied the possibility of detecting one electron in the rapidity range up to \(|y_{l}|\)\(<\)4.9, whereas the other electron is required to be within \(|y_{l}|\)\(<\)2.5. Electrons within the rapidity range \(|y|\)\(<\)2.5 are very well identified, while for those in the region \(|y|\)\(>\)2.5 the identification is not as good, although possible by using the end-cap and forward calorimeters.

Our analysis focuses on two questions:

i) how does the increased rapidity coverage for electrons affect the precision of the determination of the weak mixing angle \(sin^{2}\Theta^{lep}_{eff}\);

ii) what is the minimum jet rejection (e/jet separation) in the forward calorimeter necessary to make a significantly better measurement of \(sin^{2}\Theta^{lep}_{eff}\) possible.

The ATLAS forward calorimeter allows, in principle, for identification of electrons up to \(|y_{l}|\)\(<\)4.9, however, the particle identification capability in the forward region has not been evaluated yet. The results of our study suggest that potential gains in physics reach due to extending the rapidity coverage for one of the electrons up to \(|y_{l}|\)\(<\)4.9 are very large, indeed.

### Monte Carlo samples

We have used PYTHIA 5.7 and JETSET 7.2 to generate the physics processes under study, i.e. production of Z (including properly the \(\gamma^{*}\)/Z interference terms) and the two dominant backgrounds we had considered - top-antitop pairs and QCD 2-jet production. In Tables 1 and 2 we summarize the cross sections, number of generated events (N) and the effective luminosities of signal and background MC samples, respectively. The Monte Carlo samples were generated with mass of the parton-parton system, \(\hat{m}\)\(>\)50 GeV/c\({}^{2}\), and with \(\hat{p_{t}}\) (transverse momentum defined in the rest frame of the hard parton-parton interaction) in the range 5-7000 GeV/c. We have also verified that adding events generated with \(\hat{p_{t}}\) in the range 2-10 GeV/c and 50-7000 GeV/c for \(pp\to\) 2 jet, or Z events above 50 GeV will not affect the results by more than a fraction of 1%. (In the QCD 2-jet production case we have generated two data sets, each normalized to 50 fb\({}^{-1}\). The first set has been generated with \(\hat{p_{t}^{min}}\) - \(\hat{p_{t}^{max}}\) in the range 10-7000 GeV/c; for the other set the \(\hat{p_{t}^{min}}\) - \(\hat{p_{t}^{max}}\) range was 10-20 GeV/c and 20-50 GeV/c. When added, the two sets correspond to 100 fb\({}^{-1}\).)

### Analysis and selection cuts

We have used ATLAS standard cuts to select Z candidates for the measurement of A\({}_{F\,B}\):

i) P\({}^{electron}_{t}\)\(>\) 20 GeV/cii) 85.2 GeV/c\({}^{2}\)\(<\)M(\(e^{+}e^{-}\))\(<\)97.2 GeV/c\({}^{2}\).

To allow a realistic estimate of the precision of the determination of \(sin^{2}\Theta^{lep}_{eff}\) from the measurement of A\({}_{F\,B}\), Ulrich Baur has recalculated[5] the results from the 1998 paper[2] with the extended rapidity coverage for one of the electrons and a narrower Z mass window we have used. We present results for 4 sets of cuts:

a) \(|y_{l}|\)\(<\)2.5 for both electrons

b) \(|y_{l}|\)\(<\)2.5 for both electrons and \(|y_{Z}|\)\(>\)1.0

c) \(|y_{l}|\)\(<\)2.5 for one of the electrons, \(|y_{l}|\)\(<\)4.9 for the other electron

d) \(|y_{l}|\)\(<\)2.5 for one of the electrons, \(|y_{l}|\)\(<\)4.9 for the other electron and \(|y_{Z}|\)\(>\)1.0

In Figure 1 we present distributions of rapidity of the di-lepton system. Moving from outside inwards, each contour represents a distribution obtained with a subset of data using more restrictive cuts. The most outside contour corresponds to all di-lepton pairs. Moving inwards, the next contour corresponds to the di-lepton pairs passing the ATLAS standard Z selection cuts. The lepton rapidity coverage extends here to a maximum possible with the ATLAS detector, \(|y_{l}|\)\(<\)4.9 for \(both\) electrons. The next distribution, whose outside contour is shaded light gray, corresponds to a subset of the di-leptons pairs passing the Z selection cuts. Here, the leptons must satisfy the extended lepton rapidity cuts studied in this note, i.e. \(one\) of the electrons has its rapidity in the range 2.5\(<|y_{l}|\)\(<\)4.9, while \(the\)\(other\) is constrained to remain within \(|y_{l}|\)\(<\)2.5. Finally, the inner-most (dark-gray) distribution corresponds to the di-lepton pairs passing the Z selection cuts, and with \(both\) electrons constrained to remain within \(|y_{l}|\)\(<\)2.5. (The dark-shaded area is a subset of a light-shaded area). The area shaded in light gray represents the gain in acceptance due to the extended lepton rapidity coverage, as compared to the ATLAS coverage for precision physics. It is interesting to note that the acceptance gain would almost double, if it were possible to detect both electrons in the forward region 2.5\(<|y_{l}|\)\(<\)4.9. However, extending the rapidity coverage beyond \(|y_{l}|\)\(=\)4.9 would not result in further significant gains in acceptance, as the Z bosons are mostly produced in the central region, due to their large mass.

### Higher order radiative correction for the cuts used in our analysis

### Acceptance, reconstruction efficiency, jet rejection factors

In our quick study we have not used the full ATLAS simulation to model the detector response, but instead we used the ATLAS Technical Design Report[6] values for electron detection efficiencies and jet rejection factors in the \(|y|\)\(<\)2.5 region, valid for the standard cuts we used in our analysis. In the forward region, 2.5\(<|y_{l}|\)\(<\)4.9, we have assumed the efficiency of electron detection to be \(\epsilon_{\it fwd}\)=0.5. The jet rejection in the forward region, \(\rho_{\it fwd}\), was varied in the range 1-10\({}^{4}\). Table IV summarizes the values used.

### Results

The precision of the A\({}_{F\,B}\) measurement increases, if one allows one of the leptons to be detected in the 2.5\(<|y_{l}|\)\(<\)4.9 range, for two reasons. First, the forward-backward asymmetry is significantly increased in that region, and second, the statistical error decreases with larger statistics. Measurements of the A\({}_{F\,B}\) as a function of \(|y_{Z}|\) are shown in Figure 2. Triangles represent the values of A\({}_{F\,B}\) measured with both lepton rapidities restricted to \(|y_{l}|\)\(<\)2.5, while the squares represent the asymmetry measurements with the extended rapidity coverage, when one of the leptons is allowed to be detected in the 2.5\(<|y_{l}|\)\(<\)4.9 range.

Restricting the A\({}_{F\,B}\) measurement to the \(e^{+}e^{-}\) events with \(|y_{\,Z}|\)\(>\)1.0 improves the significance of the measurement slightly, as the gain due to the larger asymmetry for events with larger \(|y_{Z}|\) values is partially cancelled by the loss of statistics. As mentioned earlier, the most important factor determining the precision of the \(sin^{\,2}\Theta^{\it{lep}}_{\it eff}\) measurement are the values of parameters a and b, which relate the A\({}_{F\,B}\) and \(sin^{2}\Theta^{\it{lep}}_{\it eff}\). Our results are summarized in Table V.

### Discussion of results, remaining challenges

As the parameter b increases multifold with the increased rapidity coverage for one of the electrons (2.5\(<|y_{l}|<\)4.9), the resulting error on the \(sin^{2}\Theta^{lep}_{eff}\) is significantly reduced, as compared to the standard analysis which requires both leptons within \(|y_{l}|<\)2.5. The precision of the determination of the \(sin^{2}\Theta^{lep}_{eff}\) is improved by a factor of 2.9 (4.8), depending on whether the \(|y_{Z}|>\)1.0 cut is used (or not used). It is interesting to note that the precision of the analyses with extended rapidity coverage for one of the electrons is better than that obtained with LEP. We find it also very encouraging that our results will remain almost unaffected should the jet rejection factor drop to \(10^{4}\) from the nominal \(10^{5}\) in the central region, \(|y_{l}|<\)2.5.

We have assumed the electron identification efficiency of 0.5 in the region 2.5\(<|y_{l}|<\)4.9. As we require one lepton to be well identified in the central region, one could relax the selection cuts for the second electron in the forward region to achieve such high efficiency value. Our study indicates that such a strategy could succeed. We find that the jet rejection factor of \(\sim\)100 in the forward region (which might be possible to achieve) should be sufficient to allow the measurement of A\({}_{FB}\), and what follows, the weak mixing angle \(sin^{2}\Theta^{lep}_{eff}\) with precision of the order of

\[\delta sin^{2}\Theta^{lep}_{eff}=1.4\times 10^{-4}.\]

Obviously, a dedicated study of the forward calorimeter will have to be performed to determine whether an electron identification efficiency of \(\sim\)0.50, and a jet rejection factor of \(\sim\)10-100, can be achieved in reality.

We would like to emphasize the fact that all error estimates quoted in our study are purely statistical. In order to be able to exploit a possibility of measuring \(sin^{2}\Theta^{lep}_{eff}\) with such high precision, the systematic errors have to be comparably small. Quick estimates indicate that three factors are the most important ones:

\end{table}
Table 3: Parameters a and b in \(A_{FB}=b(a-sin^{2}\Theta^{lep}_{eff})\) used in our study. \(\Delta\)a and \(\Delta\)b are the QCD and QDE corrections to parameters a and b; \(\Sigma\)a and \(\Sigma\)b are the values of the parameters a and b including radiative corrections.

i) Sufficiently good knowledge of the parton distribution functions (PDF's), as it affects the knowledge of the lepton acceptance, as well as the results of radiative correction calculations.

ii) Knowledge of the lepton acceptance \(\times\) reconstruction efficiency as a function of lepton rapidity must reach the level of 0.1%, or better. This may be achievable. CDF[7] has shown that it is possible to achieve precision of about 1%, with the largest contribution being due to uncertainty in the PDF's;

iii) Effects of higher order QCD (and EWK) corrections; those can, possibly, be estimated by varying the errors on parameters a and b.

It is fair to say that, at present, controlling the systematic errors with the required accuracy remains a challenge. However, it does not seem _a priori_ impossible to achieve the desired precision. The most important systematic error is due to the uncertainty in the PDF parametrization. We have tried to estimate the variation of the forward-backward asymmetry with different PDF parametrizations. We have generated several Z samples of 500 000 events each, using older (MRSD0, EHLQ1, ELHQ2, CTEQ2L, CTEQ2M, CTEQ2F, GRV-L0) and more "modern" PDF's (MRST, CTEQ3 and CTEQ4). While a very significant variation was observed between datasets obtained with the older parametrizations, results obtained with the "modern" PDF were identical within the statistical errors (\(\sim\)1%). The uncertainty in the PDF parametrization should be at least 10 times smaller for this systematic error to be comparable with the statistical error. We hope that, with the new data coming from HERA, CDF and D0, the knowledge of PDF's will improve significantly within the next years, and that it would reach the desired precision by the time LHC experiments

Results obtained with the standard lepton rapidity coverage, with both leptons with rapidities \(|y_{\,i}|<\)2.5 are shown with triangles; while those obtained with the extended rapidity coverage (with one of the leptons with the rapidity of \(|y_{\,i}|<\)4.9) are shown with squares. The first point, \(|y_{\,Z}|<\)1.0, is identical for both sets of cuts.
