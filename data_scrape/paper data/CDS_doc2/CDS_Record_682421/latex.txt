**Abstract.** We present results of PYTHIA Monte Carlo simulations for observing rare electromagnetic penguin induced B-meson decays B\(\to\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\) with the ATLAS detector at LHC. The branching ratio sensitivity at 95% C.L. was found to be \(9\cdot 10^{-10}\) for the decay B\({}^{0}_{d}\to\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\) and \(3.4\cdot 10^{-9}\) for the decay B\({}^{0}_{s}\to\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\) for one year of LHC operation at the low luminosity \(1\cdot 10^{33}\) cm\({}^{-2}\)s\({}^{-1}\). The SM prediction for the branching ratio B\({}^{0}_{s}\to\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\) is attainable in 3.7 years. For B\({}^{0}_{d}\to\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\) one can reach the branching ratio \(4\cdot 10^{-10}\) after a five-year run.

Introduction

In recent years b-quark has become an issue of an extensive theoretical and experimental investigation. Several reasons lie behind this interest to b-physics [1]:

**Beauty is heavy**, while charm is not so heavy, and top is too heavy. That is, top will not produce hadrons because lifetime of t-quark is less than hadron formation time. Hence, it will be impossible to observe t-hadrons. So, beauty physics is a brilliant and unique field for working out theoretical approaches (e.g. Heavy Quark Effective Theory, QCD sum rules, see [2]) and refs therein) and to test various theoretical models (e.g. validity of Parton Model) e.t.c.

**Beauty is rather stable**. The coupling of the third generation quarks ( b and t quarks) to the other two generations is rather small. This gives hopes on investigating CP-violation in particular modes of B-meson decays. In addition to CP-violation, B-decays open a window on Standard Model (SM) and give possibilities to directly test SM predictions: Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) unitarity triangle and the matrix elements \(\mathrm{V_{qb},V_{qq}}\); consequences of the SM like suppression of the Flavour-Changing Neutral Current (FCNC) induced transitions. Within the framework of the SM, FCNC are forbidden at the tree level and occur only through loop diagrams. That is why their probabilities are very small. Experimental investigation of such processes makes possible to distinguish between the SM and nonstandard models of electroweak interactions which predict higher probabilities.

The interesting decay modes have small branching ratios (\(10^{-4}-10^{-7}\)) so a large B-production cross-section is essential. Hadron colliders provide a good opportunity for investigating these modes because of largest yield of b-quarks (for the LHC energy \(\sqrt{s}=14\) TeV, \(\sigma_{b\overline{b}}=0.1-0.7\) mb, so one expects \(10^{12}-10^{13}\) b\(\overline{b}\) pairs per year at the luminosity \(10^{33}\) cm\({}^{-2}\times\)s\({}^{-1}\) ). The difficulty with the use of hadron colliders is a noisy hadron environment. To overcome this obstacle one should impose kinematical restrictions for identifying a signal from a b-decay of interest.

Rare B-meson decays will be investigated with the ATLAS detector at LHC [3]. In this paper we are going to discuss rare electromagnetic penguin decays \(\mathrm{b}\to(\mathrm{s},\,d)\)+1- and investigate the possibilities to observe this decay using the mode \(\mathrm{B^{0}}\to\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\).

The next section presents the classification of possible decays of B-mesons and the related parameters of the SM. Section 3 summarizes present theoretical and experimental results on rare decays of B-mesons. Section 4 describes the Monte Carlo simulation of the decay modes of interest and background in the ATLAS detector. Acceptances, kinematical restrictions and cuts are presented, and the experimental sensitivity for rare decays is shown both for low and high luminosity operation of LHC.

## 2 Classification of B-meson Decays

B-meson decays can be classified according to the related b-quark transition.

Among different types of \(B\) meson decays, the most probable one is that connected with the **Charged Current (CC) transition**\(\mathrm{b}\to\mathrm{c}\mathrm{W}^{-}\) proportional to the large CKM matrix element \(\mathrm{V_{cb}}\): \(|\mathrm{V_{cb}}|\approx 0.036-0.044\). Figs. 1a and 1b show semileptonic B-meson decay (\(\mathrm{b}\to\mathrm{c}e\nu\) and \(\mathrm{b}\to\mathrm{c}\mu\nu_{\mu}\)) and hadronic B-meson decays (\(\mathrm{b}\to\mathrm{c}d\overline{u}\) and \(\mathrm{b}\to\mathrm{c}\overline{c}s\)) connected with these allowed b-quark decays. The B-meson decays of this type are studied in detail both theoretically and experimentally [4].

All B-meson decays which do not occur through the usual (b\(\to\)c) CC transition and thus have smaller probabilities of \(10^{-4}-10^{-10}\) are known as rare B-decays [5]. The simplest rare B-meson decay is due to the **suppressed CC b-quark transition** (\(\mathrm{b}\to\mathrm{u}\mathrm{W}^{-}\)). It is described by the graphs of Fig. 1 with (b\(\to\)c)-transition replaced by (b\(\to\)u)-transition. These decays probe the small CKM suppressed matrix element \(V_{ub}\): \(|V_{ub}|\approx|V_{cb}|\times(0.08\pm 0.02)\). A detailed description of experimental results on such decays can be found in [6].

B-meson decays can also occur through a **gluonic penguin transition** b\(\to\)(d,s)g. They can be used for measurements of the weak phase since one can observe interference between the amplitude connected with the spectator graph of Fig 2a and the penguin induced amplitude of Fig 2b. Thus, investigating e.g. the process \(B_{d}^{0}\to\pi^{+}(K^{+})\pi^{-}\) provides complementary information to the mixing-induced CP-violation.

One more issue of B-meson physics connected with rare transitions of this type is checking the unitarity of the CKM matrix, that is indespensible in order to confirm the SM or to search some new physics beyond it. The unitarity triangle for the \(B_{d}^{0}(\overline{b}d)\) system is promising since all sizes of this triangle are of the same order of magnitude. For more detail see [7].

Decays caused by **Flavour Changing Neutral Current (FCNC)** transition of b-quark \(b\to\)(s,d)\(+\gamma,\gamma^{*},Z^{0}\). are theoretically forbidden at the tree level by the Glashow-Illipoulos-Miani (GIM) mechanism in the SM and predicted to have a very small probability of \(10^{-4}-10^{-9}\)[8]. On the other hand, in nonstandard models of electroweak interactions such FCNC are allowed at a tree level and thus are not suppressed. Hence, an experimental investigation of such decays opens a window on physics beyond the SM. In the SM this b-quark transition is described by an electromagnetic penguin graph of Fig.3.

Penguin graphs are much more significant in B-meson decays than in D-meson decays because the b\(\rightarrow\)s loop contains quark with large couplings \(\rm V_{tb}\) and \(\rm V_{ts}\) whereas contributions to \(c\to u\) loop are suppressed either by small couplings \(\rm V_{cb}\) and \(\rm V_{ub}\) or by small d and s quark masses.

One can distinguish the following FCNC B-decays:

**Radiative rare B-meson decays** connected with the transition b \(\rightarrow(\rm s,d)+\) real photon. These are the processes of the type B\(\rightarrow\)X\(\gamma\), X being a meson state, with branchings \(10^{-4}-10^{-5}\). The only electromagnetic penguin rare B-decay which has been observed so far is B\(\rightarrow\)K\({}^{*}\)(892)\(\gamma\). The branching fraction of this channel was measured to be \(4.5\cdot 10^{-5}\) by CLEO [9].

**Semileptonic rare B-decays**, like B \(\rightarrow\) Xl\({}^{+}\)l\({}^{-}\) connected with the transitions b \(\rightarrow(\rm s,d)\gamma^{*},\rm Z^{0}\) (electromagnetic penguins). Typical branching fractions are predicted to be \(10^{-5}-10^{-7}\)[8]. The CKM-allowed part of this graph corresponding to b\(\rightarrow\)t transition dominates the amplitude of rare decays to final states with an odd number of s quarks. There is also CKM-suppressed b\(\rightarrow\)d penguin which may not be negligible in decays to final states with no c and s quarks. \(\rm V_{ub}\) or by small d and s quark masses.

**Purely leptonic rare B-decays** B\(\rightarrow\)l\({}^{+}\)l\({}^{-}\), \(\gamma\gamma\). They occur through penguin and box loop graphs and have very low probabilities \(10^{-8}-10^{-15}\). These decays probe \(|\rm V_{tb}|^{2}|\rm V_{td}|^{2}\) and they are sensitive to nonSM couplings [10].

Rare semileptonic and purely leptonic FCNC electromagnetic penguin induced B-decays will be discussed in more detail in subsequent sections.

## 3 Rare B-decays: branching ratio estimations within the SM and experimental results

Theoretical interest in B-decays lies in their potential role for the presicion tests of the SM, i.e. on the CKM matrix elements \(\rm V_{tq},q=d,s,b\). Together with the improved values of \(\rm V_{cb}\) and \(\rm V_{ub},\ \rm V_{td}\) will determine the CKM unitarity triangle. At the same time B-decays may provide a hint for the nonSM physics. In addition, the rates of FCNC semileptonic and purely leptonic decays are sensitive to the values of \(\rm m_{t}\) and nonSM interactions [8].

Theoretical framework for B-meson decays rests on using the QCD-improved effective Hamiltonian [11] which incorporates QCD corrections to the penguin graph of Fig. 3. This effective Hamiltonian describes the so-called \(|\Delta\rm B|=1\) and \(|\Delta\rm B|=2\), \(|\Delta\rm Q|=0\) transitions of the initial

b\(-\)quark. For most quantities related to B-meson decays one needs, however, additional information on B-meson structure. Various theoretical approaches can be used here. The most popular one is the Heavy Quark Effective Theory (HQET) (see [2] and refs therein) which allows a reduction of the number of independent form factors describing the transition of the initial B-meson to final meson state to one or few Isgur\(-\)Wise (IW) functions [12]. For calculating these IW functions one can apply potential\(-\)model inspired arguments. The results reviewed here are obtained within such an approach [8].

Other possibilities to allow for a composite structure of initial and final hadron states are to use quark models [13] or to apply QCD sum rules [14]. The results of all the mentioned approaches within 10% accuracy agree with a simple hypothesis of the Vector Meson Dominance (VMD) that the \(q^{2}\)-behaviour of all transition form factors is dominated by a monopole contribution of the nearest vector meson with corresponding quantum numbers. For example, for the process \(\mathrm{B}\to\mathrm{K}^{*}\gamma^{*}\) the form factor leads \(F(q^{2})=F(0)/(1-q^{2}/M_{\mathrm{B}^{*}}^{2})\).

Theoretical predictivity of HQET is very high for b\(\to\)c transitions, whereas it is less accurate for exclusive rare decays because of heavy\(-\)to-light hadron transitions. So, further improvements of the theoretical results are highly desirable.

Table 1 shows theoretical predictions based on HQET and VMD for the interesting rare penguin induced modes and experimental results [8]. The branchings are estimated for \(\mathrm{m}_{t}=1\,50\) GeV, \(f_{\mathrm{B}_{d}}=200\) MeV, \(|\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{td}}|=9.18\times 10^{-3}\).

The \(\mathrm{Br}(\mathrm{B}\to\rho\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\) (the last line of the Table 1) is estimated with the VMD. Namely, within this model the following relation is valid

\[\frac{\mathrm{Br}(\mathrm{B}\to\mathrm{X}\mathrm{l}^{+}\mathrm{l}^{-})}{ \mathrm{Br}(\mathrm{B}\to\mathrm{X}\gamma)}=\frac{\mathrm{Br}(\mathrm{B}\to \mathrm{Y}\mathrm{l}^{+}\mathrm{l}^{-})}{\mathrm{Br}(\mathrm{B}\to\mathrm{Y} \gamma)}\]

in case the processes \(\mathrm{B}\to\mathrm{X}\mathrm{l}^{+}\mathrm{l}^{-}\) and \(\mathrm{B}\to\mathrm{Y}\mathrm{l}^{+}\mathrm{l}^{-}\) are dominated by a virtual photon exchange. This relation is fulfilled for the inclusive modes \(\mathrm{X}=\mathrm{X}_{\mathrm{s}}\) and \(\mathrm{Y}=\mathrm{X}_{\mathrm{d}}\) both for \(\mathrm{l}=\mu\) and \(e\)[8]. So it may seem reasonable to use VDM for estimating \(\mathrm{Br}(\mathrm{B}\to\rho\mu^{+}\mu^{-})\). After that, Table 1 shows branchings of all the processes of interest.

## 4 Simulation of \(\mathrm{B}\to\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\) signal and backgrounds.

To investigate the possibility of observing of \(\mathrm{B}\to\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\) decay channel with the ATLAS detector at LHC the following b\(-\)decay modes were analyzed :

\[\begin{array}{cccc}\mathrm{\bar{b}}&\to&\mathrm{X}&\mathrm{(including\,\, semileptonic\,\,decay\,\,mode)}\\ \hookrightarrow&\mathrm{B}_{\mathrm{d}}^{0}&\to\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\end{array} \tag{1}\]

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|} \hline Decay mode & Branching & Experimental Upper Limit \\ \hline \hline \((\mathrm{B}_{\mathrm{d}},\mathrm{B}_{\mathrm{u}})\to\mathrm{X}_{\mathrm{s}} \mu^{+}\mu^{-}\) & \(8.5\times 10^{-6}\) & \(5\times 10^{-5}\)[16] \\ \hline \((\mathrm{B}_{\mathrm{d}},\mathrm{B}_{\mathrm{u}})\to\mathrm{X}_{\mathrm{d}} \mu^{+}\mu^{-}\) & \(3.7\times 10^{-7}\) & \(-\) \\ \hline \((\mathrm{B}_{\mathrm{d}},\mathrm{B}_{\mathrm{u}})\to\mathrm{K}\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\) & \(6\times 10^{-7}\) & \(3.6\times 10^{-4}\)[17] \\ \hline \((\mathrm{B}_{\mathrm{d}},\mathrm{B}_{\mathrm{u}})\to\mathrm{K}^{*}\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\) & \(2.9\times 10^{-6}\) & \(2.3\times 10^{-5}\)[16] \\ \hline \(\mathrm{B}_{\mathrm{s}}\to\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\) & \(1.8\times 10^{-9}\) & \(-\) \\ \hline \(\mathrm{B}_{\mathrm{d}}\to\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\) & \(8.0\times 10^{-11}\) & \(5.9\times 10^{-6}\)[17] \\ \hline \((\mathrm{B}_{\mathrm{d}},\mathrm{B}_{\mathrm{u}})\to\rho\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\) & \(2.1\times 10^{-7}\) & \(-\) \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}

The first channel corresponds to the signal events. Two last modes correspond to background events.

Only events with at least one muon with \(p_{T}>6\) GeV /c and \(|\)\(\eta\)\(|\)\(<1.6\) were retained for analysis. These cuts are connected with ATLAS level-1 single muon trigger requirements. For the second muon the cuts \(p_{T}>5\) GeV /c and \(|\)\(\eta\)\(|\)\(<2.5\) were used, allowing the muon identification. The probability to identify muon is \(\epsilon_{\mu}=0.8\).

Particle parameters in generated events were smeared according to the experimental resolutions:

\[\sigma(p_{T})/p_{T} = 5\cdot 10^{-4}p_{T}\oplus 1.2\%\] (4) \[\sigma_{IP} = 14\ \oplus\ 72/(p_{T}\ \sqrt{|\ \sin\theta\ |})\ \ \ {\rm for}\ |\)\(\eta\)\(|\)\(<2\) (5) \[\sigma_{Z} = 20\ \oplus\ 83/(p_{T}\ \sqrt{|\ \sin\theta\ |}^{3})\ \ \ {\rm for}\ |\)\(\eta\)\(|\)\(<2\) (6) \[\sigma_{IP} = 40\ \oplus\ 345/(p_{T}\ \sqrt{|\ \cos\theta\ |})\ \ \ {\rm for}\ \ 2<|\)\(\eta\)\(|\)\(<2.5\) (7) \[\sigma_{Z} = 40\ \oplus\ 300/(p_{T}\ \sqrt{|\ \cos\theta\ |}\ |\ \sin\theta\ |)\ \ \ {\rm for}\ \ 2<|\)\(\eta\)\(|\)\(<2.5\) (8)

Here \(\theta\) is the angle of a particle with respect to the beam, \(p_{T}\) is the transverse momentum of a particle, \(\sigma_{IP}\) and \(\sigma_{z}\) are the impact parameter resolution and the resolution in the direction of the beam, respectively. The determination of the \({\rm B}^{0}_{\rm d}\)-decay vertex position depends on impact-parameter resolution. Because of the small life-time of the \({\rm B}^{0}_{\rm d}\)-meson, it is important to improve these values to obtain the secondary vertex position with high accuracy, especially for rare B-decays. The impact-parameter resolution of the present vertex detector layout was discussed in detail in [18].

Effective cuts for excluding the background contribution are necessary because of very small branching ratio of purely muonic B-decay channel. Cuts related to the quality of the secondary vertex fit are effective in rejecting background in which the two muons originate from different vertices. A cut in the decay length of the B meson rejects background from Drell-Yan pairs and any other background in which at least one of the particles come from the primary vertex.

Table 2 contains the cross-sections of generated events for each decay channel and the cross-sections of events passed through different acceptance cuts, taking into account the muon identification probability. The signal cross-sections includes a coefficient equal to two which takes into account \(\bar{\rm B}^{0}_{\rm d}\)-decay in the same mode.

In Figs. (4-6) the distributions of main parameters of signal and background events are presented.

Fig.4a shows an effective-mass distribution for \({\rm B}^{0}_{\rm d}\rightarrow\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\) - decays after the cuts on the transverse momenta (\(p_{T1}>6\) GeV / \(c\), \(p_{T\,2}>5\) GeV /_c_) and pseudorapidites ( \(|\)\(\eta_{1}\)\(|\)\(<1.6\), \(|\)\(\eta_{2}\)\(|\)\(<2.5\)) for both muons. The fitted mass and resolution are \(M_{{\rm B}^{0}_{\rm d}}=5.276\pm 0.003\) GeV /c\({}^{2}\), \(\sigma=0.0378\) GeV /c\({}^{2}\), the mass resolution being \((\sigma/M)=0.7\%\). Fig.4b presents the transverse momentum distribution for the reconstructed \({\rm B}^{0}_{\rm d}\)'s. The average transverse momentum of the reconstructed \({\rm B}^{0}_{\rm d}\)'s is \(\langle p_{T}\rangle=18.0\pm 0.7\) GeV /c.

The effective mass distribution for two sets of background events in the mass range \(4\div 7\) GeV /c\({}^{2}\) is presented for muons with the same cuts as for the signal events in Figs. 5a and 6a. The effective mass distribution of background events is flat in this region. The transverse-momentumdistributions of background events (Figs. 5b and 6b ) are similar to the distribution of signal events. Background from the particles coming directly from the primary vertex can be suppressed by cuts on the decay length of \(\mathrm{B}^{0}_{d}\) -candidates. The \(\mathrm{B}^{0}_{d}\) decay-vertex position can be determined from the reconstructed track parameters. Vertex reconstruction for \(\mathrm{B}\)\(\rightarrow\)\(\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\) was made by fitting the two muon tracks. The distribution of decay length for \(\mathrm{B}\)\(\rightarrow\)\(\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\)-channel for signal and background are given in Fig. 4c and 5c,6c, respectively. One can see the signal distribution to be much wider than the background one. Further analysis of events shows that the \(\chi^{2}\) of vertex reconstruction of \(\mathrm{B}^{0}_{d}\) in the signal events is smaller than 3, whereas \(\chi^{2}\) of vertex reconstruction for "\(B^{0}_{d}\)" from background events is much larger (see Figs 4d and 5d,6d, respectively). Thus, an essential reduction of background events is possible by using \(\chi^{2}\) and decay length cuts. For instance, using the decay length cut of 0.3 mm and \(\chi^{2}\)-cut of 3 decreases the signal by \((20\pm 5)\%\) and reduces background by a factor of 10 ( for one semimuonic b-decay the corresponding efficiency of passing through this cut is \(\epsilon_{1}^{1}=(12\pm 3)\%\) and for the both semimuonic b-decays it is \(\epsilon_{1}^{2}=(11\pm 2)\%\)). The cross-sections of events passing these cuts are presented in the Table 2.

The vector directed from the primary vertex to the secondary vertex of \(\mathrm{B}^{0}_{d}\) should be collinear to the vector of \(\mathrm{B}^{0}_{d}\) transverse momentum. This requirement allows to reduce background combinations formed by two muons from different jets. It has been shown in [15] that this cut is very effective in suppressing of background events in which the two tracks did not originate from a single B hadron in the case of \(\mathrm{B}^{0}_{d}\)\(\rightarrow\)\(\pi^{+}\pi^{-}\). Distributions of the angle \(\alpha\) between \(p_{T}\) of \(\mathrm{B}^{0}_{d}\)-candidate and line joining primary and reconstructed \(\mathrm{B}^{0}_{d}\) vertices for events passed all previous cuts are shown at Figs. 4e and 5e,6e ( at two last figures the \(\alpha\)-distributions were restricted at 10\({}^{\circ}\) to obtain the more clear behaviour at small \(\alpha\)). One could see that this distribution for signal events has maximum at \(\alpha=0^{\circ}\). We chose the \(\alpha\) to be smaller than 3\({}^{\circ}\). This cut keeps \((78\pm 5)\%\) of the signal. The efficiency of passing through this cut is \(\epsilon_{2}^{1}=(8\pm 3)\%\) for events in which one b decays to \((\mu\)+X) and \(\epsilon_{2}^{2}=(5\pm 1)\%\) for events in which the b and \(\overline{b}\) both decay to \((\mu\)+X).

It is clear that after all the cuts described above, the decay products of the two B-mesons move in a narrow cone, if muons of these different B-mesons form a \(\mathrm{B}^{0}_{d}\)-candidate. One could expect that in this case the \(\mathrm{B}^{0}_{d}\)-candidate should be accompanied by charged particles in a narrow cone around it's direction. It was found that the most effective suppression of background events compared to the signal ones occurred when one required the absence of charged particles with \(p_{T}>1\) GeV /\(c\) in the cone \(\theta<9^{\circ}\) around the B-direction. The signal events pass through this cut with efficiency \(\epsilon=(84\pm 4)\%\). For one semimuonic b-decay background events corresponding efficiency is \(\epsilon_{3}^{1}=(5\pm 2)\%\) and for both semimuonic b-decays \(\epsilon_{3}^{2}=(5\pm 1)\%\). In Figs. 4f and 5f, 6f the dependence of number of events from number of charged particles with \(p_{T}>1\) GeV /\(c\) in the cone \(\theta<9^{\circ}\) is shown.

Considering the cross-sections of the two sets of background events one can see that the first set (one semileptonic b-decay) is larger than the second one (two semileptonic b-decays). The discrepancy between the cross-sections of these two samples after applying all cuts comes from the \(p_{T}\)- and mass-cuts, the efficiencies of all other cuts being consistent for both samples.

The first set was used for the final estimation of the branching ratio upper limit for B\(\rightarrow\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\) decay mode. The cut efficiencies \(\epsilon_{i}^{1},\ i=1,2,3\) for background events were treated as independent.

Results for decay channel \(\mathrm{B}_{\mathrm{s}}^{0}\rightarrow\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\) can be derived from the analysis of the decay modes shown above, since the reconstruction efficiency for \(\mathrm{B}_{\mathrm{s}}^{0}\rightarrow\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\) is the same as for \(\mathrm{B}_{\mathrm{d}}^{0}\rightarrow\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\), and the background mass distribution is flat in the B-hadron mass region.

Table 3 presents the signal and background cross-sections after all cuts within \(\mbox{$\,\stackrel{{+40}}{{-80}}\,$}\) MeV /\(c^{2}\) mass interval for \(\mathrm{B}_{\mathrm{d}}^{0}\)-meson and within \(\mbox{$\,\stackrel{{+80}}{{-40}}\,$}\) MeV /\(c^{2}\) mass interval for \(\mathrm{B}_{\mathrm{s}}^{0}\)-meson.

Considering the background from b \(\rightarrow\mu\) after applying all cuts one expects 210 events within \(\mbox{$\,\stackrel{{+40}}{{-80}}\,$}\) MeV /\(c^{2}\) (minus two and plus one standard deviations) of the \(\mathrm{B}_{\mathrm{d}}^{0}\) mass from a one-year (10\({}^{7}\) s) run at the luminosity \(L=10^{33}\) cm\({}^{-2}\)s\({}^{-1}\). One obtains the branching ratio of \(9\times 10^{-10}\) for the \(\mathrm{B}_{\mathrm{d}}^{0}\rightarrow\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\) and \(3.4\times 10^{-9}\) for the \(\mathrm{B}_{\mathrm{s}}^{0}\rightarrow\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\) at 95% C.L.

Estimations for signal and background cross-sections at larger pseudorapidity for trigger muon (\(|\)\(\eta\)\(|\)\(<2.2\) instead of \(|\)\(\eta\)\(|\)\(<1.6\)) are presented in the Table 4. The correction factor for the background is 1.337 when changing the pseudorapidity limit of the trigger muon from 1.6 to 2.2, obtained from an unbiased pseudorapidity spectrum of muons. The signal cross-section increases by 1.6 times in new \(\eta\)-interval. Assuming that the efficiency of cuts stay constant for signal and background, one could expect 281 events within \(\mbox{$\,\stackrel{{+40}}{{-80}}\,$}\) MeV /\(c^{2}\) of the \(\mathrm{B}_{\mathrm{d}}^{0}\) mass from a one-year run at the low luminosity. The upper limit to the branching ratio is estimated to be \(6.7\times 10^{-10}\) for the \(\mathrm{B}_{\mathrm{d}}^{0}\rightarrow\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\) and \(2.5\times 10^{-9}\) for the \(\mathrm{B}_{\mathrm{s}}^{0}\rightarrow\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\) at 95% C.L.

## 5 Conclusion

We discussed possibilities to investigate with the ATLAS detector at LHC purely leptonic B-decays modes. They are predicted to have very low probabilities within the SM whereas they are expected to have higher probabilities in Nonstandard models. So, their experimental study is a brilliant field to test the SM and physics beyond it. Estimates of possibilities to observe these decay modes with the ATLAS detector were performed using the PYTHIA Monte Carlo simulation program. The upper limit to the branching ratio was found to be \(9\cdot 10^{-10}\) for the \(\mathrm{B}_{\mathrm{d}}^{0}\rightarrow\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\) and \(3.4\cdot 10^{-9}\) for the \(\rm B^{0}_{s}\to\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\) at 95% C.L. for one year run at low luminosity for trigger range \(|\eta\ |<1.6\). So the required integral luminosity for attaining the SM prediction for the branching ratio \(\rm B^{0}_{s}\to\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\) is \(3.7\times 10^{4}\rm pb^{-1}\) that relates to 3.7 years at low luminosity. To observe a \(\rm B^{0}_{s}\) signal with 5 standard deviations above the background the integrated luminosity should be \(2.3\cdot 10^{5}\,\rm pb^{-1}\). For \(\rm B^{0}_{d}\to\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\) one could expect to reach the branching ratio \(4\cdot 10^{-10}\) in five years of the low-luminosity LHC operation.

The estimation of the upper limit to the branching ratio for trigger range \(|\eta\ |<2.2\) was obtained. It was found to be \(6.6\cdot 10^{-10}\) for the \(\rm B^{0}_{d}\to\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\) and \(2.5\cdot 10^{-9}\) for the \(\rm B^{0}_{s}\to\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\) at 95% C.L. for one year run at low luminosity. To achieve the SM prediction for the \(\rm B^{0}_{s}\to\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\) mode the integrated luminosity should be \(2\times 10^{4}\) pb\({}^{-1}\). To observe a \(\rm B^{0}_{s}\) signal with 5 standard deviations above the background the integrated luminosity should be \(1.2\cdot 10^{5}\) pb\({}^{-1}\). For \(\rm B^{0}_{d}\to\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\) one could expect to reach the branching ratio \(2.9\cdot 10^{-10}\) in five years of the low-luminosity LHC operation.
