**Abstract**

**We report on the results of the measurements made in Pisa on a sample of Module 0 fibres. The aim was to measure the characteristics of a random sample of fibres that are installed on Module 0 to verify the homogeneity of response of the fibres.**Introduction

During the 1996 the ATLAS collaboration foregone the construction of a complete real size slice of the central region part of the hadronic calorimeter, the so called Module 0 (M0). This module has been constructed respecting the final layout of TileCal, and it will be exposed to a particle beam for calibration.

Besides the work of mechanical construction, tests to verify the quality of the components used, has been carried out. Among these, a test of the optical characteristics for the homogeneity of the fibres has been performed. The aim of this note is to reports on these measurements and summarise the obtained results.

## 2 Description of the sample of fibres

Double clad Kuraray Y11 fibres have been used to instrument the M0 module. In order to improve the light yield one fibre end has been aluminised to reflect to the PMT the light that would be otherwise lost or only partially reflected. Eight groups of fibres of different length (255, 235, 225, 215, 195, 165, 155 and 135 cm) have been measured. Each group consisted in ten fibres.

To quantify the fibre-to-fibre differences due to the process of production, we measured each fibre using the procedures outlined in [1]. In short, the fibre was optically coupled to a scintillator excited by a \(Sr^{90}\) source (Fig. 1).

The fibre was optically connected to a R1635-2 Hamamatsu PM and the anode current was recorded. By computer control the scintillator was

moved along the fibre in steps of 2 cm and the current was recorded at each step. Before each measurement the anode current was calibrated in units of photoelectrons per second, by measuring the charge spectrum at the same time as the anode current. All data has been saved on disk and analysed off-line.

## 3 Data analysis

### Fitting with a generalised function

Since the fibres had one end aluminised, it is not possible to fit the data with the usual double exponential function [1]. To take into account the reflection, we had to generalise the simple model used so far.

The response of the WLS fibres is well described by a function of the type:

\[f(\,\boldsymbol{x}) = A,\exp\left(-\frac{\boldsymbol{x}}{\lambda_{s}}\right)\,+\,A_{l} \exp\left(-\frac{\boldsymbol{x}}{\lambda_{l}}\right) \tag{1}\]

where for core and clad light components, \(\lambda\), and \(\lambda_{l}\) are the attenuation lengths and \(A\), and \(A_{l}\) are the amount of trapped light.

The fibre (whose length is \(L\)) is excited by a scintillator placed at a distance \(\boldsymbol{x}\) from the PM (Fig. 2). The intensity of light reaching directly the PM is:

\[I(\boldsymbol{x}) = I_{s}\exp\left(-\frac{\boldsymbol{x}}{\lambda_{s}}\right)\,+\,I_ {l}\exp\left(-\,\frac{\boldsymbol{x}}{\lambda_{l}}\right) \tag{2}\]

while the light reaching the aluminised end has an intensity:

\[I(L) = I_{s}\exp\left(-\,\frac{L-\boldsymbol{x}}{\lambda_{s}}\right)\,+ \,I_{l}\exp\left(-\,\frac{L-\boldsymbol{x}}{\lambda_{l}}\right) \tag{3}\]

Figure 2: The setup for the fibre scan with reference frame.

If \(R\) is the reflection factor at the aluminised end, the amount of the reflected light at PM will be:

\[I_{refl} = RI_{s}\exp\left(-\frac{L}{\lambda_{s}}\right)\exp\left(-\frac{L-x}{ \lambda_{s}}\right)\] \[+ RI_{l}\exp\left(-\frac{L}{\lambda_{l}}\right)\exp\left(-\frac{L-x}{ \lambda_{l}}\right)\]

where we have assumed that there is no mixing between long and short light components during the reflection.

The total light is then:

\[I_{tot} = I_{dir}+I_{ref}\] \[= I_{s}\exp\left(-\frac{x}{\lambda_{s}}\right)+I_{l}\exp\left(- \frac{x}{\lambda}\right)\] \[+ R\left[I_{s}\exp\left(-\frac{2L-x}{\lambda_{s}}\right)+I_{l} \exp\left(-\frac{2L-x}{\lambda_{l}}\right)\right]\] \[= I_{s}\exp\left(-\frac{x}{\lambda_{s}}\right)\left[1+R\exp\left(- 2\frac{L-x}{\lambda_{s}}\right)\right]\] \[+ I_{l}\exp\left(-\frac{x}{\lambda_{l}}\right)\left[1+R\exp\left(- 2\frac{L-x}{\lambda_{l}}\right)\right]\]

This fit function should be used for the analysis of aluminised fibres. \(I_{s}\), \(I_{l}\), \(\lambda_{s}\), \(\lambda_{l}\) and \(R\) are the free parameters. However this function turned out to be not so useful in fitting the data. The fits shows that the parameters are strongly correlated resulting in a large uncertainty in their value. We then decided to follow a different approach: in each group of fibres we chopped away the aluminised end of one fibre and painted the end in black. The fibres was then re measured and the results compared.

### Reflection factor

Figure 3 shows the curves of a fibre before and after the aluminization was cut away.

Let us assume that \(A\) is the intensity of light trapped in the fibre when the fibre is excited at the end opposite to the PM (\(x=L\)). The amount of light reaching directly the PM (the only light in case the aluminised end was removed) is then:

\[I_{L}^{bl} = \frac{1}{2}Ae^{-L/\lambda_{l}} \tag{6}\]where we have neglected the short component, as it is allowed since the fiber is much longer than \(\lambda\), (about 25 cm).

If the fibre is aluminised we have to add the contribution of the reflection:

\[I_{L}^{al} = \frac{1}{2}Ae^{-L/\lambda_{i}}+\frac{1}{2}RAe^{-L/\lambda_{i}}\] \[= \frac{1}{2}Ae^{-L/\lambda_{i}}(1+R)\]

The first term is the amount of light propagated directly in the PM direction while the second one represents the reflected light. (Of course (7) and (6) are special cases of (1) and (5) when \(x=L\) and we neglect the short component.) Taking the ratio of (7) to (6), the reflection factor can be evaluated directly:

\[R = \frac{I_{L}^{al}}{I_{L}^{bl}}-1 \tag{8}\]

In order to apply this method to the experimental data analysis it is necessary to know \(I_{L}^{al}\) and \(I_{L}^{bl}\). It is not possible to measure directly these quantities from the data because the fibre scanning ends same centimetres (\(\sim 15\) cm) before the fibre end.

Figure 3: Attenuation curve of a fibre before and after the aluminised end was removed.

To evaluate \(I_{L}^{a1}\) and \(I_{L}^{b}\) we fit the available data using a double exponential function and neglecting the reflection. In this way the effects of the reflection go in the value of \(\lambda_{s}\) and \(\lambda_{l}\) that come out greater than the real ones. We have then extrapolated the fit to \(x=L\) and computed \(I_{L}^{a1}\) and \(I_{L}^{b2}\). Finally we compute \(R\) using the equation (8).

The results are reported in Fig. 4 and in Table 1, the mean value and the standard deviation of \(R\) are:

\[<R> = 0.750 \tag{9}\] \[\sigma = 0.069\] (10) \[\frac{\sigma}{<R>} = 9.2\% \tag{11}\]

In Figure 4 we notice that the reflection factor for the 225 cm long fibre is two standard deviations away from the mean value. This can be due to measurement problems or more likely to the fact that the aluminization of that particular fibre was not perfect. If we exclude this value we have:

\[<R> = 0.773 \tag{12}\] \[\sigma = 0.028\] (13) \[\frac{\sigma}{<R>} = 3.6\% \tag{14}\]

### Analysis over the last 10 cm

In order to establish the light yield we considered the final portion of the fibre, the last ten centimetres and in this part of the fibre we measure the

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|} \hline \(L\) (cm) & \(R\) \\ \hline \hline
255 & 0.795 \\
235 & 0.803 \\

215 & 0.738 \\
195 & 0.743 \\

135 & 0.783 \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}

light yield. The method consists in fitting the data using the sum of two exponential, extrapolate the fibre response to the last ten centimetres of fibre and compute the average:

\[\bar{I} = \frac{1}{10}\int_{L-10}^{L}I(x|I_{1},\lambda_{1},I_{2},\lambda_{2})dx \tag{15}\]

This procedure is motivated by the fact that the fibre-scintillator optical coupling will occur in this region when the fibres are mounted in the calorimeter. The results of this analysis for all the fibres of all groups are shown in Figure 5 and in the Table 2 where it has been reported also the fibre-to-fibre dispersion.

Figure 5: Distribution of the core light output average over the last 10 cm for the various fibres.

The dependence of the light yield on the fibre length reflects the effects of the attenuation of the light in the fibre.

We conclude that the light yield of fibres within each group is rather uniform with a spread of about 5%.

### Analysis over the entire length of the fibre

The purpose of these measurements has been to establish the optical characteristics of the fibres. Therefore we need to fully exploit the function (5). As already noticed the high correlation between the parameters of the fit does not allow to exploit this function in a fit with five free parameters. We decided to simplify the fit by fixing the reflection factor to the average value (\(R=0.75\)) obtained with the data analysis discussed above. Furthermore a first approximate value (starting point of the fit) of the other parameters could be obtained from the fit of the fibres whose aluminization was removed.

In this way it has been possible to perform a rather stable fit of all the data obtaining the attenuation lengths and the light yield. The results of the fit for the long component are shown in Figures 6 and 7 and summarised in Table 3 in which we have quoted also the value of the dispersion of the optical characteristics.

From these data we can see two characteristics behaviours:

1. the attenuation length increases with the fibre length. We could reproduc this result with a MonteCarlo simulation of the light propagation in a fibre ([2]) and is understood since the light yield as a function of the distance from the PM is not a pure exponential function but

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|} \hline \(L\) (cm) & \(\bar{I}\) (n.p.e) & RMS & RMS/\(\bar{I}\) \\ \hline
255 & 1.03 & 0.04 & 3.9 \\
235 & 1.03 & 0.07 & 6.9 \\
225 & 1.01 & 0.06 & 5.6 \\
215 & 1.04 & 0.05 & 4.5 \\
195 & 1.11 & 0.05 & 4.2 \\
165 & 1.38 & 0.12 & 8.7 \\
155 & 1.51 & 0.07 & 4.7 \\
135 & 1.75 & 0.05 & 3.0 \\ \hline Mean & & & 5.2 \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}

flatens off at large distances, therefore the average slope decreases for long fibres.
2. The number of photoelectrons is rather stable for fibres longer than 195 cm and then increases for shorter fibres as a consequence of the reflection at the fibre end.

We can conclude that the optical characteristics of these fibres within each group are uniform with a dispersion of about 5% and these conclusions are in agreement with the analysis of the last ten centimetres of the fibres.
