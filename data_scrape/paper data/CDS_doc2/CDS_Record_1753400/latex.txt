Introduction

Track and vertex finding is one of the most challenging tasks in reconstructing events from proton-proton collisions recorded by the ATLAS detector [1] at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN. The ATLAS detector [1] is a cylindrical1 multi-purpose detector designed to make precision measurements of known physics processes and search for new physics. The track reconstruction is performed by its inner detector (ID) that consists of a silicon pixel detector, a silicon micro-strip detector, and a transition radiation tracker. It covers the pseudorapidity range \(|\eta|<2.5\). A thin superconducting solenoid provides a 2 T magnetic field in the ID volume to enable precision track momentum measurements. The pixel detector [2] consists of three concentric cylindric barrel layers at radii of 50.5, 88.5 and 120.5 mm around the beam pipe, and three pixel disks on each side located at 495 mm, 590 mm and 650 mm along the beam line to cover regions with pseudorapidity of \(|\eta|<2.7\). Cylinders and disks are constructed from identical modules. The modules are arranged such that the sensor segmentation defines a precise transverse measurement in the bending plane of the magnetic field and a less precise measurement in the longitudinal direction aligned with the beam line in the barrel. The modules on the disks are arranged such that the less precise measurement is in the radial direction. In the local frame of the module, the transverse direction is referred to as the local \(x\) (corresponding to the pixel rows) and the longitudinal direction as the local \(y\) direction (corresponding to the pixel columns). A typical pixel has a size of 50 \(\mu\)m (400 \(\mu\)m) in the transverse (longitudinal) direction. The silicon sensor thickness is 250 \(\mu\)m. In the summer of 2014, an additional concentric cylindric barrel layer at radius of 33 mm, the Insertable B-Layer [3],[4] (IBL), was installed to enhance the track reconstruction capabilities in the upcoming Run-2. The IBL sensors have a thickness of 200 \(\mu\)m and pixels with 50 \(\mu\)m (250 \(\mu\)m) size in the transverse (longitudinal) direction.

Footnote 1: ATLAS uses a right-handed coordinate system with its origin at the nominal interaction point (IP) in the centre of the detector and the \(z\)-axis along the beam direction. The \(x\)-axis points from the IP to the centre of the LHC ring, and the \(y\)-axis points upward. Cylindrical coordinates \((r,\phi)\) are used in the transverse \((x,y)\) plane, \(\phi\) being the azimuthal angle around the beam direction. The pseudorapidity is defined in terms of the polar angle \(\theta\) as \(\eta=-\ln\tan(\theta/2)\). The distance \(\Delta R\) in the \(\eta-\phi\) space is defined as \(\Delta R=\sqrt{(\Delta\eta)^{2}+(\Delta\phi)^{2}}\).

When a charged particle crosses the silicon sensors in the pixel detector, it can produce charge deposition in several pixels. All adjacent (in longitudinal or transverse direction) pixels are combined into pixel clusters, which are then used in the track reconstruction. The current ATLAS track reconstruction software does not directly use the pixel cluster size information in order to make an initial estimate of track parameters or differentiate between good and spurious pixel clusters. The study documented here is performed using simulated events and serves as a proof of concept and demonstrator of potential applications of using such information for tracking purposes.

Pixel clusters originate from a number of sources. The clusters denoted "good" in this note are the clusters directly produced by charged particles from beam-beam interactions (both in primary hard scattering and in pile-up collisions). There are a number of sources for so-called "spurious" clusters, most of which are not due to prompt charged particles. These sources include noise, clusters left by secondary particles arising from interactions of primary particles in material, clusters left by particles produced in beam-gas interactions, afterglow (clusters induced by radiative decays inside the detector material), and clusters due to very low-\(p_{\rm T}\) particles which loop in the magnetic field inside the pixel detector volume (so called "loopers"). All of these spurious clusters will greatly increase in numbers in higher pile-up conditions, especially after the high luminosity LHC upgrade. Spurious clusters present a challenge for the pattern recognition and track reconstruction algorithms as they increase the time needed for the pattern recognition, lead to fake tracks, or degrade resolution for track parameters if wrongly attached to tracks. Therefore, it is beneficial to remove as many of these spurious clusters as possible while maintaining high efficiency for good clusters.

Simulation

All Monte Carlo (MC) simulated samples used in the current study were produced with full ATLAS detector simulation [5], including the newly installed IBL layer.2 All results presented in this note were obtained by studying simulated single-particle samples and \(t\bar{t}\) events. Single particle samples were produced assuming constant particle momentum and a flat \(\eta\) distribution in the range \(|\eta|\)\(<\)2.5. Besides a single primary particle per event, there are also secondary particles produced as a result of the primary particle interaction with the detector material. The secondary particles were generated by GEANT4 [6]. Table 1 summarizes the single-particle samples. The \(t\bar{t}\) sample was produced for the semi-leptonic decay mode with statistics of 100 events. No pile-up was generated for the \(t\bar{t}\) sample. All samples were generated assuming the Run-1 beam spot conditions with \(\sim\)45 mm width in the \(z\) direction.

Footnote 2: The current implementation of the IBL simulation includes only planar sensors with 200 \(\mu\)m thickness.

## 3 Pixel Cluster Size

The size of clusters produced by charged particles in the momentum range of interest is primarily determined by geometry: the straight line path length of the track in the silicon sensor and its projections onto the pixel orientation planes. Besides fluctuations in charge deposition, there are three effects which can affect the cluster size. The first effect is due to \(\delta\)-rays, which can deposit charge in pixels not crossed by the primary particle. However, \(\delta\)-rays have a well understood range in silicon with an exponential decay constant of 100 \(\mu\)m [7]. The cluster size "deviations" considered in this study are of 250 \(\mu\)m or more, and at such distances \(\delta\)-ray contributions are negligibly small. The second effect is due to "split clusters", where a pixel hit is missing from the middle of a cluster, or a cluster is at the sensor edge. These features can be recognized and repaired (in the case of "split clusters"), and this is done before analyzing cluster size distributions. The third effect is related to merged clusters from two tracks. The merged clusters can sometimes have cluster sizes which are twice as large compared to the average size. However, the fraction of merged clusters is relatively small, and this effect is not directly considered in the current study.

The expected geometrical size of good pixel clusters in the longitudinal direction (in the local frame of the module), \(N_{\rm col}\), in the barrel pixel layers [2] depends on the thickness of the silicon sensor, \(t\), pixel pitch in the longitudinal direction, \(p\), and the incident angle, \(\theta\):

\[N=t/(p|\tan\theta|),\ \mbox{rounded to the nearest integer},\] \[N_{\rm col}=max(1,N+\Delta), \tag{1}\]

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|c|} \hline \hline Particle & Momentum, p [GeV] & \(\eta\)-range & Number of events \\ \hline \hline \(\pi^{+}\) & 6.5 & \(|\eta|\)\(<\)2.5 & 50K \\ \(\pi^{+}\) & 0.15 & \(|\eta|\)\(<\)0.5 & 10K \\ \(K^{+}\) & 6.5 & \(|\eta|\)\(<\)2.5 & 50K \\ \(p^{+}\) & 6.5 & \(|\eta|\)\(<\)2.5 & 50K \\ \(\mu^{+}\) & 65.0 & \(|\eta|\)\(<\)2.5 & 50K \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 1: Summary of single particle samples.

where the correction, \(\Delta\), is introduced in order to emulate the electronics threshold effects and is \(\Delta\)=1(0) for \(t/(p|\tan\theta|)-N>-0.2\) (\(t/(p|\tan\theta|)-N<-0.2\)). The cluster size increases as the angle \(\theta\) gets smaller. By knowing the global position of the cluster, one can predict the expected size of the cluster by assuming that this cluster was produced by a particle originating from either \(Z_{0}=0\) or \(Z_{0}=Z_{\rm xx}\) along the beam line, where \(Z_{\rm xx}\) is the \(z\) coordinate of the interaction vertex. A more accurate prediction can be made if the angle \(\theta\) of the track (to which cluster is attached) is known. In the case of spurious clusters, the correlation between the cluster size and the cluster \(z\)-position is much less prominent. For some of the sources of spurious clusters there will not be any correlation at all. Therefore, one can use a difference between the observed cluster size and the predicted cluster size, \(\Delta N_{\rm col}\)=\(N_{\rm col}\)\({}^{\rm obs}\)\(-N_{\rm col}\)\({}^{\rm pred}\), to separate between good and spurious clusters.

For simplicity, all of the results in this note are presented for on-track and off-track clusters. The on-track clusters are defined as clusters attached to tracks of prompt charged particles. It was verified that essentially all on-track clusters in the samples used in this study are good clusters as defined in Section 1. The off-track clusters are all other clusters, which are not attached to reconstructed tracks of prompt charged particles. For single-particle samples used in this study, essentially all off-track clusters are spurious clusters due to noise, "loopers" and secondary particles produced in material interactions of primary hadrons. In the case of \(t\bar{t}\) sample, off-track clusters present a mix of spurious and good clusters due to tracks failing the quality and kinematic requirements of the track reconstruction algorithm. In particular, the \(p_{\rm T}\) threshold used in the track reconstruction algorithm was set to 400 MeV.

Figure 1 shows examples of actual and predicted \(N_{\rm col}\) distributions for on-track (good) and off-track (spurious) IBL clusters in the single \(\pi^{+}\) sample for various \(\eta\) ranges. Equation 1 is used to obtain predictions for on-track and off-track clusters. One can see that the prediction for good clusters made based on the cluster \(\eta_{\rm cl}\) calculated with respect to \(Z_{0}=Z_{\rm vx}\) accurately describes the actual cluster \(N_{\rm col}\) distribution, while there is a significant difference between the actual and predicted \(N_{\rm col}\) distributions for off-track (spurious) clusters. The same trends are also observed in the single \(p^{+}\), \(K^{+}\), and \(\mu^{+}\) samples, as shown in Fig. 2. Figure 3 shows examples of actual and predicted \(N_{\rm col}\) distributions for on-track (good) and off-track IBL clusters in \(t\bar{t}\) events. One can see that for good (on-track) clusters the \(N_{\rm col}\) prediction based on the cluster \(\eta_{\rm cl}\) calculated with respect to \(Z_{0}=Z_{\rm vx}\) accurately describes the actual distribution. The off-track clusters in \(t\bar{t}\) events consist of two components: spurious clusters, which one would want to remove, and a considerable fraction of good clusters from unreconstructed tracks, which are impossible to remove. Nonetheless, the difference between predicted and actual cluster \(N_{\rm col}\) distributions for off track clusters is already apparent. This difference is even more pronounced at large \(|\eta_{\rm cl}|\) for purely spurious clusters due to "loopers", very low \(p_{\rm T}\) particles looping in the magnetic field (see Fig. 4), and secondary particles produced in material interactions of primary hadrons (see plots on the right in Figs. 1-2). Differences between good and spurious clusters are better illustrated by comparing \(\Delta N_{\rm col}\) distributions for the two classes. Figures 5 and 6 show comparison of \(\Delta N_{\rm col}\) distributions for on-track and off-track clusters for single \(\pi^{+}\) and \(t\bar{t}\) samples respectively, for three different \(\eta\) ranges: 1.0-1.2, 1.6-1.8 and \(>\)2.4.

The size of good pixel clusters in the transverse direction in the local frame of the module (in the direction perpendicular to the beam line), \(N_{\rm row}\), does not in general depend on particle \(\eta\), and for a vast majority of good clusters it is less than five pixels, \(N_{\rm row}\)\(<\)5. This statement is true for both disks and barrel layers. The only weak dependence of \(N_{\rm row}\) for barrel layers on particle \(\eta\) can be related to the effects of multiple scattering, which become more pronounced with larger \(\eta\). In the case of spurious clusters, \(N_{\rm row}\) can be significantly larger than four pixels because secondary particles or loopers can travel in the plane of silicon sensors or at a small angle to it in the direction perpendicular to the radius. Figures 7 and 8 demonstrate \(N_{\rm row}\) distributions for on-track (good) and off-track (mostly spurious) clusters in IBL and disks. Secondary particles from material interactions and "loopers" have very broad \(N_{\rm row}\) distributions.

In the case of end-cap disks, \(N_{\rm col}\) does not have any significant dependence on the incident angle because this angle is quite large and the pixel pitch is 400 \(\mu\)m. Most good pixel clusters in the diskshave \(N_{\rm col}\)!\(<\)3. In the case of spurious clusters, the situation can be different. For example, very low-\(p_{\rm T}\) particles produced at small \(\eta\) will loop in the magnetic field inside the pixel detector and will leave multiple clusters at larger \(\eta\). These so-called loopers will generally hit the disks at smaller incident angles and will tend to produce clusters with larger \(N_{\rm col}\). Figure 8 shows a comparison of \(N_{\rm col}\) for good and spurious clusters in association with single \(\pi^{+}\) and in \(t\bar{t}\) events. A vast majority of primary particles have clusters with \(N_{\rm col}\)!\(<\)3, while secondary particles due to material interactions of primary hadrons can often produce very large clusters.

## 4 Removal of Spurious Clusters

As discussed in Section 3, differences in \(N_{\rm col}\) and \(N_{\rm row}\) between good and spurious clusters can be used to remove some fraction of these spurious clusters. For the barrel layers, one can exploit the predicted dependence of \(N_{\rm col}\) on cluster \(\eta\) and place a cut on \(\Delta N_{\rm col}\) as a function of \(\eta\). One can also combine this cut with a fixed cut on \(N_{\rm row}\) to enhance the rejection of spurious clusters. In the case of disks, there is no significant dependence of \(N_{\rm col}\) and \(N_{\rm row}\) on \(\eta\) for good clusters. To illustrate how cutting on the cluster shapes can remove spurious clusters, we present a simple set of selections, which include cuts on both cluster sizes. More detailed studies, which include the impact on the track reconstruction efficiency and fake rate, would be required to fully evaluate the effectiveness of such techniques. The results for on-track (good) and off-track (mostly spurious) cluster efficiencies in IBL and disks were obtained with the following cuts to accept good clusters:

* **Disks**: \(N_{\rm row}\)\(\leq\)3 and \(N_{\rm col}\)\(\leq\)2;
* **IBL**: \(N_{\rm row}\)\(\leq\)4 and \(\Delta N_{\rm col}\)\(>\)\(c(\eta)\), where \(c(\eta)\) has the following values:3 Footnote 3: The cluster centroid position and either \(Z_{0}=0\) or \(Z_{0}=Z_{\rm xx}\), depending on the scenario, were used to calculate \(\eta\). \[c(\eta) = -2\ {\rm for}\ |\eta|<\)1.4; \[c(\eta) = -3\ {\rm for}\ 1.4\!<|\eta|<\)1.9; \[c(\eta) = -4\ {\rm for}\ 1.9\!<|\eta|<\)2.4; \[c(\eta) = -5\ {\rm for}\ |\eta|>\)2.4.

The choice of these cuts was driven by the goal to have an efficiency for good clusters above 99%. Better rejection of spurious clusters can be achieved by placing upper cuts on \(N_{\rm col}\) and \(\Delta N_{\rm col}\) for clusters in IBL (or other barrel layers). However, these cuts need to be determined based on the study of merged clusters in the dense environment of very high-\(p_{\rm T}\) jets, where clusters originating from two nearby particles can be merged into one large cluster. In the case of \(N_{\rm row}\) cuts, the proposed values are already safe and very close to optimal. As one can see from Figs.7 and 8, most good clusters have \(N_{\rm row}\)\(<\)3 and even if two nearby clusters are merged together their combined size is going to be \(N_{\rm row}\)\(<\)5 in a vast majority of cases.4 The \(\delta\)-rays can also result in larger \(N_{\rm row}\)  but the "range constant" [7] is \(\sim\)100\(\mu\)m (equivalent to two extra pixels in \(N_{\rm row}\)) which is still safely within the proposed cut range.

Footnote 4: The \(N_{\rm row}\) distribution for good clusters in disks is a bit sharper than that for IBL clusters, therefore a somewhat tighter cut was used for the disks.

The performance of the cuts described above can be quantified by the rejection efficiency defined as the number of removed clusters divided by the total number of clusters of a particular type. The rejection efficiencies for on-track and off-track clusters in IBL and in disks are shown in Figs. 9-11 and Figs. 12-13, respectively. For IBL clusters, there are two sets of plots in these figures: one corresponding to \(\Delta N_{\rm col}\) calculated by assuming \(Z_{0}=0\) and the other corresponding to \(\Delta N_{\rm col}\) calculated by assuming \(Z_{0}=Z_{\rm xx}\). One can interpret these results as what would happen if cuts were applied before any track reconstruction (\(Z_{0}=0\) case) in order to remove spurious clusters and what would happen if the cuts were applied after Figure 1: Examples of \(N_{\rm col}\) distributions for on-track (left) and off-track (right) IBL clusters in the single \(\pi^{+}\) sample for small (top), large (middle), and all cluster \(\eta_{\rm cl}\) values with respect to the origin. Data points show the observed cluster size, while black and red histograms show predicted \(N_{\rm col}\) distributions assuming that the cluster’s \(\eta_{\rm cl}\) is calculated respect to the actual production vertex or the origin, respectively. One can see that the black histogram accurately describes the \(N_{\rm col}\) distribution for on-track (good) clusters, while there is a significant difference between the actual and predicted \(N_{\rm col}\) distributions for off-track (spurious) clusters.

Data points show the actual cluster size, while black and red histograms show predicted \(N_{\rm col}\) distributions assuming that the cluster’s \(\eta_{\rm cl}\) is calculated respect to the actual production vertex or the origin, respectively. One can see that the black histogram accurately describes the \(N_{\rm col}\) distribution for on-track (good) clusters, while there is a significant difference between the actual and predicted \(N_{\rm col}\) distributions for off-track (spurious) clusters.

Data points show the observed cluster \(N_{\rm col}\) while black and red histograms show predicted \(N_{\rm col}\) distributions assuming that the cluster’s \(\eta_{\rm cl}\) is calculated respect to the actual production vertex or the origin, respectively. One can see significant differences between the actual and predicted cluster \(N_{\rm col}\) distributions.

Black and red histograms show \(\Delta N_{\rm col}\) calculated using the incident angle assuming the actual \(Z_{0}=Z_{\rm xx}\) vertex position and the origin (\(Z_{0}=0\)), respectively.

Spurious off-track clusters in single particle samples are due to “loopers” and secondary particles produced in material interactions of primary hadrons. In the case of \(t\bar{t}\) events, off-track clusters present a mix of spurious and good clusters due to unreconstructed tracks. Only the off-track distribution is shown for the low-\(p_{\rm T}\)\(\pi^{+}\) sample because there are no reconstructed tracks in this sample. One can see significant differences between on-track and off-track distributions.

track reconstruction in order to identify wrongly associated pixel clusters on track. In the latter case, the number of wrongly associated clusters can be used as a criterion to identify and remove fake or badly mis-reconstructed tracks (such tracks could be re-fitted by removing obviously wrong clusters). The cuts based on the \(Z_{0}=Z_{\rm{vx}}\) calculation are slightly more efficient in removing spurious clusters because the \(N_{\rm{col}}\) prediction is more precise. The following conclusions can be made based on the rejection efficiency studies presented here:

* The efficiency for good (on-track) clusters is close to a target value of \(\sim\)99%, regardless of \(|\eta|\).
* The rejection efficiency for spurious clusters depends on \(|\eta|\), location (IBL or disks), and type of spurious clusters.
* For IBL, the rejection efficiency for spurious clusters due to secondary particles from material interactions ranges from \(\sim\)10% at small \(|\eta|\) to up to 40% for large \(|\eta|\). For low-\(p_{\rm{T}}\) particles looping in the magnetic field, this rejection efficiency can be up to 90%, depending on the angle \(\theta\) at which such particles were originally produced. The rejection efficiency for off-track clusters in \(t\bar{t}\) events ranges from \(\sim\)5% at small \(|\eta|\) to up to 30% for large \(|\eta|\). However, one has to keep in mind that a large fraction of off-track clusters in \(t\bar{t}\) events will be due to a genuinely good clusters produced by particles with \(p_{\rm{T}}\)\(<\)400 MeV (track reconstruction cut-off). This results in somewhat lower rejection efficiencies.
* For disks, the rejection efficiency for spurious clusters due to secondary particles from material interactions is 10%-20%. In the case of low-\(p_{\rm{T}}\) particles looping in the magnetic field, it can be as large as 60%, depending on the angle \(\theta\) at which such particles were originally produced. The rejection efficiency for off-track clusters in \(t\bar{t}\) events is \(\sim\)10%.

The results presented for the cluster clean-up procedure demonstrate that the proposed procedure based on the cluster size has a good potential for reducing the number of spurious clusters before the track reconstruction is run and may also be helpful in rejecting fake tracks after the track is reconstruction is performed by counting the number of wrongly associated clusters on tracks.

## 5 Cluster Size and \(z\) Position

For barrel layers, the information about the cluster global position, \(N_{\rm{col}}\), pixel pitch and thickness can be used in order to reconstruct the \(z\)-position of a particle's production vertex along the beam line:

\[Z=Z_{\rm{cluster}}-\frac{R\times p\times(N_{\rm{col}}-\delta)}{t} \tag{2}\]

where \(R\) is the cluster radius with respect to the beam spot, \(Z_{\rm{cluster}}\) is the cluster global \(z\) coordinate, \(N_{\rm{col}}\) is the cluster size in the longitudinal direction (local \(y\) direction of the module), \(\delta=0.8\) is an empiric correction which accounts for the fact that a particle does not always cross the full length of the first and last pixels in the cluster, \(p\) is the pixel pitch the longitudinal direction and \(t\) is the sensor thickness. Therefore, it is enough to know only the cluster centroid location along the beam line and size in order to reconstruct a particle's production point \(z\) coordinate5 and angle \(\theta\) respect to the beam line. When applying Eq. 2, it is assumed that a particle enters the cluster from the side closest to the origin, \(Z_{0}=0\). This assumption is correct for the cases where \(|Z_{\rm{cluster}}|>|Z_{\rm{vx}}|\). Figure 14 shows example distributions of the difference between predicted and true \(z\) production positions obtained based on \(N_{\rm{col}}\) information for good and spurious IBL clusters in the single \(\pi^{+}\) sample and in \(t\bar{t}\) events. The distribution for good Figure 9: Rejection efficiency of cluster clean-up cuts for on-track (left) and off-track (right) IBL clusters produced in association with single \(\pi^{+}\) tracks. The \(\Delta N_{\rm col}\) value used in the clean-up cuts was calculated for two scenarios: \(Z_{0}=0\) (top) and \(Z_{0}=Z_{\rm xx}\) (bottom). The off-track clusters are due to secondary particles produced in material interactions of primary hadrons. Similar trends are also observed in the single \(K^{+}\), \(p^{+}\), and \(\mu^{+}\) samples.

clusters has a Gaussian shape with width \(\sigma\sim\)20 mm, which does not depend on the particle type and \(\eta\). To obtain the expected intrinsic resolution, Eq. 2 can be reinterpreted as \(Z=Z_{\rm cluster}-R\times(Z_{\rm last\ pixel}-Z_{\rm 1st\ pixel})/t\). Therefore, the \(z\)-position resolution is related to the position resolutions of the first and last pixels in the cluster, i.e. \(p/\sqrt{12}\), so that \(\sigma(Z)\sim\sqrt{2}R\times p/(t\sqrt{12})\). Assuming the IBL parameters (average \(R\)=33 mm, \(t\)=200 \(\mu\)m, and \(p\)=250 \(\mu\)m), the intrinsic \(z\)-position resolution is expected to be \(\sim\)17 mm, which is consistent with the observed resolution of \(\sim\)20 mm.6 In the case of spurious clusters, the \(z\)-position cannot be accurately reconstructed for a significant fraction of these clusters, especially at large \(\eta\).

Footnote 6: Multiple scattering effects, variations in the radius of IBL clusters due to the tilt of the IBL modules, presence of so-called long pixels with \(p\)=400 \(\mu\)m at chip boundaries, and broken clusters at module boundaries result in somewhat larger resolution.

In summary, the ability to reconstruct the \(z\) coordinate of the particle production point based on the cluster length and position, with a resolution which is largely independent of a track's \(\eta\), has a number of potential applications for the track reconstruction:

* it can be used to reject spurious clusters based on the significant differences in shape observed in Fig. 14;
* the \(z\) coordinate of the particle production point can be reconstructed using only the IBL layer with a precision of \(\sim\)20 mm even for very forward tracks at large \(\eta\); a better precision of 2-4 mm can potentially be achieved if the pixel pitch is reduced to 25-50 \(\mu\)m (it is 250 \(\mu\)m for IBL) during the future upgrade of the ATLAS pixel detector (this option will require dedicated studies);
* the initial estimate of particle's angle \(\theta\) and \(z\) coordinate of the production point using the very first pixel cluster produced by this particle can be important for improving the pattern recognition during the track reconstruction by narrowing the search cone around this estimated direction, hence limiting the amount of hit combinations considered, reducing the CPU time and rate of fake and mis-reconstructed tracks; this can be especially important for fast track reconstruction at the trigger level.

In the single \(\pi^{+}\) sample, the off-track clusters are due to secondary particles produced in material interactions of primary hadrons. In \(t\bar{t}\) events, off-track clusters present a mix of spurious and good clusters due to unreconstructed tracks. Trends in the single \(K^{+}\), \(p^{+}\), and \(\mu^{+}\) samples are the same as those observed in the single \(\pi^{+}\) sample.

## 6 Conclusions

The results presented in this note demonstrate that the cluster size information from the ATLAS pixel detector can be effectively used for a number of applications during the track reconstruction. For clusters in barrel layers produced by particles from primary hard-scattering interactions or pile-up collisions, the size along the beam direction strongly depends on the \(\eta\) of the particles. In the case of spurious clusters due to noise, secondary particles from material interactions of primary particles, very low-\(p_{\rm T}\) particles or other sources, the cluster size dependence on \(\eta\) is considerably different from that for good clusters. The size of good clusters in disks and in the direction perpendicular to the beam line does not exhibit any significant dependence on track \(\eta\). The typical size for such clusters is relatively small (in most cases it is less than four pixels). The situation is different in the case of spurious clusters, which tend to have considerably larger cluster size in the direction perpendicular to the beam line. Therefore, the cluster size in the direction along and perpendicular to the beam line can be used to reject a considerable fraction of spurious clusters. A dedicated study of the track reconstruction efficiency and fake rate needs to be performed in order to determined the most optimal way to use the cluster size information for rejecting spurious clusters.

For barrel layer, the information about the cluster position and size along the beam line can also be used to make an initial reconstruction of track's direction and \(z\) coordinate of the production point based on a single cluster. The resolution of this initial estimate of the \(z\)-position is independent of particle's type and \(\eta\). It depends on the layer radius and on the thickness and pitch of the pixels. For the IBL layer recently installed at ATLAS, this resolution is \(\sim\)20 mm. A resolution of 2-4 mm can potentially be achieved if the pitch is reduced to 25-50 \(\mu\)m in the future ATLAS pixel detector upgrade. However, dedicated studies are required in order to confirm these predictions. This initial estimate of track \(\eta\) and \(z\) coordinate of the production point can be used to reject spurious clusters and should improve the pattern recognition. It can also be used to provide partial track reconstruction in the very forward direction for

In each case the red curve shows a Gaussian fit to the distribution for on-track (good) clusters; the widths are \(\sim\)20 mm. In the single \(\pi^{+}\) sample, off-track clusters are dominated by spurious clusters due to secondary particles produced in material interactions of primary hadrons. In \(t\bar{t}\) events, off-track clusters consist of both spurious and good clusters from unreconstructed tracks.
