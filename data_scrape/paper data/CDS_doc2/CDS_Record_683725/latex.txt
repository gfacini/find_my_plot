###### Abstract

We present our studies on the search for a Standard Model Higgs boson of 300 or 600 GeV decaying into W boson pair with the ATLAS detector. The significance of the signal over the backgrounds has been optimized in the central region as well as in the forward regions, where forward jet tagging has been required. Results are presented for both cases of low and high luminosity. For a Higgs mass of 600 GeV, the detector performance has been studied both at particle level with the ATLFAST 2.0 detector simulation and with a full DICE simulation. A clear signal can be observed after the first years of data-taking at low luminosity. We have also extended our study to the lower Higgs mass of 300 GeV to investigate whether this channel could provide complementary evidence to the gold-plated H\(\rightarrow\)ZZ\(\rightarrow\)4 lepton channel.

Introduction

For a Standard Model Higgs boson with a mass within the range 200-700 GeV the H\(\rightarrow\)ZZ\(\rightarrow\)4 lepton channel will provide the clearest evidence at LHC. For higher Higgs masses the cross section of this channel decreases rapidly and other channels have to be considered. We present here a study performed to search for a heavy Higgs boson decaying into W pairs. One W is required to decay leptonically into \(e(\mu)\nu\), providing an isolated high P\({}_{T}\) lepton trigger, while the other W is reconstructed from its hadronic decays.

A previous study at particle level [1] showed that a Higgs boson signal with a mass in the range 600-1000 GeV should be clearly observed in the \(H\to WW\to l\nu\ jj\) and \(H\to ZZ\to ll\ jj\) channels. A similar study was also reported in reference [2] based on a complete tree-level QCD calculation, but the detector response was simulated in a very crude manner. In this note we present results for a Higgs mass of 300 and 600 GeV from a particle level study which includes the ATLFAST2 detector simulation [3] and the contribution from the pile-up at high luminosity. For the 600 GeV Higgs we also cross check these results to a full DICE simulation carried out in Pisa. A study for searching a Higgs Boson signal with \(M_{H}\) greater than 800 GeV is currenltly being completed [4].

Figure 1 shows the cross section for the Higgs boson production at LHC as a function of M\({}_{Higgs}\), for the various production mechanisms. Gluon fusion is the dominant process. The vector boson fusion is one of the most important contributions for a very high Higgs mass and it has the distinctive characteristic of the presence of two quarks in the final state, yielding two forward jets. The presence of the two forward jets plays a key role in separating signal from background. In this note we consider only the vector boson fusion process as we want to exploit the forward jet production.

The main background for the H\(\rightarrow\)WW channel are the \(t\overline{t}\) pair production and the Standard Model \(W\)+ jets production (WW continuum is negligible as shown in [5]: we checked in our analysis that it contributes only few percent of the total background both at \(M_{H}=600\) and \(M_{H}=300\) GeV ). The first source of background contains a real W which decays hadronically. In the second one the hadronic jets can fake a real W.

In the second section we describe the signal and background event generation.

The third section is fully dedicated to the 600 GeV Higgs study. Jet reconstruction, central event selection, forward jet tagging and Higgs mass reconstruction are described in detail. The particle level/ATLFAST2 simulation is then compared to the full simulation in section 4 where issues like the calorimeter calibration and the reconstruction of the W and Higgs boson masses have been addressed.

Then in section 5 we explore the lower Higgs mass of 300 GeV, to investigate whether evidence for complementing the gold\(\rightarrow\)plated H\(\rightarrow\)ZZ\(\rightarrow\)4 lepton channel would be possible in this channel.

## 2 Signal and Background Event generation

The generation of both signal and background has been performed using the PYTHIA MonteCarlo [7]. After the physics generation the events are reconstructed using either the fast detector simulation (ATLFAST) or the full simulation (DICE) to account for the interactions of the outgoing particles with the ATLAS detector.

Figure 1: Cross Sections for different Higgs production mechanisms at LHC [6].

A study on Higgs generation using the PYTHIA MonteCarlo has been performed in 1995 by D. Froidevaux _et al._ and is summarized in ref [8]. We repeated this study for \(m_{H}=600\) GeV and \(m_{H}=300\) GeV to address two different aspects:

* Higgs bosons in the mass range \(300<m_{H}<600\) GeV produced via vector boson fusion can be generated using two different calculations for the hard scattering Matrix Element;
* the new version of PYTHIA 6.1 became available while this work was ongoing. We checked how the new featured version 6.1 differs from the old version 5.7.

### Kinematics of the process

The production of Higgs bosons via Vector Boson Fusion is described, at tree level, by the Feynman diagram in figure 2.

The Higgs boson is accompanied in the final state by two quarks.

Kinematically, the main features of this process are:

Figure 2: Higgs production by Vector Boson Fusion mechanism in hadronic collisions.

* the two outgoing quarks are emitted at a small angle (see figure 3 (c)), but within the acceptance of the ATLAS detector. These two quarks fragment into jets that we label as "forward jets";
* as the production mechanism is essentially electroweak we would expect little jet activity not coming from the hard scattering process.

For these two reasons in this analysis we divide the ATLAS detector in two pseudorapidity regions: a central region (\(|\eta|<2\)) and a forward region (\(2<|\eta|<5\)). The value \(|\eta|=2\) has been chosen as most of the forward jet production occurs at \(|\eta|>2\) (see figure 3(c)).

Thus we search for the Higgs boson decay products in the central region, while we reconstruct the forward jets in the forward region. Furthermore we require low additional jet activity in the central region (Central Jets Veto). The cuts applied to enhance this signature will be described later in sections 3 and 4.

The two central jets from the W boson decay are expected to be very close to each other in \(\eta\) - \(\phi\) space (\(\Delta R=\sqrt{\Delta^{2}\eta+\Delta^{2}\phi}\)) due to the high transverse \(P_{T}\) of the Higgs decay products, as shown in figure 6 for the 600 GeV case.

### Generating Higgs bosons via Vector Boson Fusion using PYTHIA

The PYTHIA generator provides us with two different methods to describe the vector boson fusion process. The first calculation takes into account final state products (Higgs + forward quarks), while the other considers only the Higgs boson to evaluate the Matrix Element. The former approximation will be referred as \(2\to 3\) process, while the latter as \(2\to 1\) process.

The PYTHIA numbering scheme for these processes is reported below:

* \(2\to 3\) process is selected using ISUB=123 (\(WW\) fusion) and ISUB=124 (\(ZZ\) fusion).
* \(2\to 1\) process is selected using ISUB=5 (\(WW\) fusion) and ISUB=8 (\(ZZ\) fusion).

As stated in the PYTHIA manual as well as by the author of the Monte-Carlo [9], the first approximation is preferred at low Higgs masses (\(M_{H}<700\)Figure 3: \(P_{T}\) of W in (a) and \(\eta\) of W in (b); \(\eta\) of forward jets in (c) and \(P_{T}\) of forward jets in (d) : comparison between processes 5-8 (dashed) and 123-124 (full) in PYTHIA 5.7.

GeV), the second for high Higgs masses (\(M_{H}>400\) GeV) [7]. The mass region studied in this note is in the middle, so it is worth understanding the differences between these two options.

The cross section is about 30% higher for the \(2\to 1\) subprocess in the mass range \(300\div 600\) GeV. We should consider this difference as a systematic uncertainty on the overall normalization. In the following we will use the lower cross section, showing that signal can be identified even in this more conservative situation.

On the other hand we found no significant differences in the kinematical variables as shown in figure 3.

Some slight differences arise in the pseudorapidity distribution of the forward partons. This is expected, as the forward quarks production mechanism is different in the two processes. It will cause a difference in the forward tagging efficiency which we checked to be less than a percent and so it is well below our experimental sensitivity.

For these reasons we decided to generate our Higgs events with the "pessimistic" process (2\(\to\)3), the same results would apply for the 2\(\to\)1 process by rescaling the cross section.

### PYTHIA 6.1 vs. PYTHIA 5.7

Both options of the PYTHIA MonteCarlo used in the previous section yield a Higgs mass lineshape which is not exactly a Breit-Wigner distribution as would be expected for a resonant particle.

In the PYTHIA 6.1 version a new switch (MSTP(49)) has been inserted which allows to use two different mathematical definitions of the Higgs lineshape: when this parameter is set to 0 we obtain the same results as using the Pythia 5.7 version. When it is set to 1 a symmetric distribution is obtained. The mass shapes with this two different choices are shown in figure 4.

There is no significative change in cross-section using the new PYTHIA 6.1 in both the approximations \(2\to 1\) and \(2\to 3\). We compared also the distribution of kinematical quantities obtained with the 6.1 version with the one obtained with the 5.7. The \(P_{T}\) distribution of the \(W\)'s, shown in figure 5, is softer for the version 6.1. This is explained by the fact that the mean value of the generated mass is also lower. All other relevant distributions are very similar.

## 3 ATLAST2 Simulation of the 600 GeV Higgs

In this section we study the Higgs boson at M\({}_{Higgs}=600\) GeV [10].

The best channel to study such a heavy Higgs is the \(H\to WW\to l\nu jj\) one, where \(l\) is a lepton (\(e\) or \(\mu\)). As mentioned before, we will only consider those events which are produced via the vector boson fusion mechanism as we will tag the forward jets produced in association with the Higgs. The predicted \(\sigma\cdot\)BR for this process is 0.0620 pb, and the number of expected events in one year of LHC run at the highest luminosity (\(10^{5}pb^{-1}\)) is about 6200.

We optimized our event selection criteria on large ATLFAST2 samples. We then compared these results to a full DICE simulation (next section).

ATLFAST2 samples were generated for both signal and backgrounds (W+jets and \(t\overline{t}\)), and at high and low luminosity. Their specific characteristics are described for each mass in the related analysis, while the common features are the following:

* The leptonically decaying W was forced to decay to a \(\mu\nu\) pair. The PYTHIA cross section is doubled in order to account for the e\(\nu\) decay which is not simulated 1; Footnote 1: We expect some difference in efficiency between muon and electron detection, but this is not affecting our results.
* No kinematic cuts are imposed to the signal at generation level;
* The cross section for the W+jets samples was multiplied for the conservative K factor 1.5 in order to account the QCD corrections to the production of high \(P_{T}\) W/Z+jets [11]. This factor is close to the one which was produced by a recent study, yielding a factor 1.3 between the VECBOS prediction and the CDF data, plus and extra factor 1.3 (depending on \(P_{T}^{W}\)) between the PYTHIA and VECBOS prediction.

### Event reconstruction

Event reconstruction is performed by using the standard ATLFAST tools:

* MAKCLU for jet reconstruction
* MAKMUO for muon recognition and reconstruction;* MAKMIS for \(\not\!\!{\rm E}_{\rm r}\);

A special algorithm was implemented to reconstruct the high \(P_{T}\) W decaying hadronically from the two final state jets very close in space (see figure 6) with the \(\Delta R\) distribution peaking at about 0.8.

If, on one hand, a pair of small cones provides a good reconstruction efficiency of the jets energy on the other, introducing a too small cone can result in the loss of a big fraction of the jets energy introducing low energy tails in the W invariant mass distribution.

So, for the W reconstruction we used one single cone with \(\Delta{\rm R}=0.8\) (big cone). The invariant mass of this object is evaluated as the invariant mass of the cells belonging to that cluster as if they were massless particles. Amongst the big cones found, the one with the mass nearest to W's is chosen.

Inelastic non-diffractive minimum bias cross section for LHC is estimated to be \(\sim 70\) mb [12]. Under high luminosity conditions, pile-up contribution is no longer negligible: ATLFAST2 takes such effects into account by adding a resolution worsening term in the smearing procedure of particles' four-momenta. This term depends on the dimension of the cone for clustering and on the particle's \(P_{T}\) as discussed in [3].

Figure 6: \(\Delta R\) between jets coming from hadronic W at generation level.

### The 600 GeV Higgs samples

Samples of signal and background were simulated for conditions of both high and low luminosity: three years of data acquisition at low luminosity (\(3\cdot 10^{4}\,pb^{-1}\) ) and one year at high luminosity ( \(1\cdot 10^{5}\,pb^{-1}\) ) were considered.

Table 1 summarizes the samples used for this analysis.

The \(P_{T}\) cut reported in table 1 is related to the transverse momentum of the particles responsible for the hard interaction in their center of mass (i.e t and \(\overline{t}\) for t\(\overline{t}\), W and associated parton for W+jets).

### Selection of central events

The first selection applies to the leptonically decaying W:

* \(P_{T}^{\mu}\,>\,50\) GeV
* \(\not\!\!{\rm E}_{\rm T}\,>\,50\) GeV
* \(\eta\,<\,2.0\)

both at high and low luminosity.

A further cut on leptonic \(P_{T}(W)\) selects events accordingly with the previous high \(P_{T}\) requirements: \(P_{T}^{W_{\rm{t}ep}}>100\) GeV is the chosen threshold (see figure 7(c)).

Those events with a high \(P_{T}\) central charged lepton are expected to fire the ATLAS trigger which is already simulated by the ATLFAST program.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|c||c|c|c|c|} \hline Samples & Cuts & Luminosity & Simulated & Expected \\ \hline \(H\to WW\) & none & High (1 yr) & \(100,000\) & 6,200 \\ \(\rightarrow\) l\(\nu\)jj & none & Low (3 yrs) & \(100,000\) & 1,860 \\ \hline \(t\overline{t}\rightarrow\) l\(\nu\)jj & \(P_{T}\,>\,50\) & High (1 yr) & \(900,000\) & 14,800,000 \\ \cline{2-5}  & \(P_{T}\,>\,50\) & Low (3 yrs) & 1,000,000 & 4,440,000 \\ \hline W+jj \(\rightarrow\) l\(\nu\)jj & \(P_{T}\,>\,50\) & High (1 yr) & \(900,000\) & 189,400,000 \\ \cline{2-5}  & \(P_{T}\,>\,50\) & Low (3 yrs) & 1,000,000 & \(56,820,000\) \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 1: Samples produced for 600 GeV simulation. We also report cuts at generator level and expected number of events in data acquisition for both high and low luminosity conditions.

Figures 7(a) and 7(d) show that these cuts are loose: this is required to avoid blurring the difference between signal and background mass shape by biasing them with high \(P_{T}\) thresholds.

The distributions shown describe the high luminosity conditions; low luminosity results are similar.

The hadronic W is required to be central (\(|\eta|<2\)) both at high and low luminosity: figure 8 shows that no significant amount of signal is lost in selecting events within the central region. This is the same reason justifying the \(\eta\) cut on the muon shown in figure 7(b).

A two sigma invariant mass cut ( \(\Delta M_{W}=|M_{bigcone}-M_{W}|<M_{cut}\) ) is also required (where \(M_{bigcone}\) is the mass of the reconstructed hadronic W and \(M_{W}\) is the nominal W mass): \(|\Delta M_{W}|<10\) GeV at low luminosity and \(|\Delta M_{W}|<15\) GeV at high luminosity. The expected resolution on W mass is in fact \(\sim 5\) GeV at low luminosity and 7 GeV at high luminosity (see also section 4.4).

We show in figure 9 for both high and low luminosity conditions the reconstructed mass cut on both signal and backgrounds.

Table 2 reports the effect of central cuts on signal and background for high luminosity conditions, while table 3 reports the evolution, with the cuts, of the statistical significance.

We remark that for each step of our analysis and for each plot statistical significance (S/\(\sqrt{B}\)) and signal-to-background (S/B) ratio are computed by taking into account all events passing the cuts (that is all the bins of each histogram are considered), instead of choosing a 'core region' which could give even bigger statistical evidence to signal over background.

The central cut effects at low luminosity are reported in table 4 and the corresponding statistical significance in table 5.

Figure 7: Background and signal distribution for \(P_{T}\) (a) and \(\eta\) (b) of the lepton coming from W decay (after muon trigger), \(E_{T}^{miss}\) (after muon trigger) (c) and \(P_{T}\) of leptonic W (d) (after \(P_{T}\) cut on leptons). Distributions are normalized to 1.0 and are referred to high luminosity conditions. The distribution in (b) does not go beyond \(|\eta|=2.5\) since the trigger has limited coverage.

### Veto on central jets

After hadronic W's identification, cuts on additional jets are used to exploit the low central activity of the signal with respect to backgrounds. This cut is particularly useful to reject \(t\overline{t}\) which is expected to have central jet activity due to b quarks from top decays.

An event is rejected if jets, other than the ones identified as jets coming from W, are found with \(P_{T}>P_{thr}\) (to be fixed ) and \(|\eta|<2\).

The \(P_{T}\) dependence of this veto is sketched in figure 10: here we show how the efficiencies for signal and backgrounds behave as a function on the threshold at low luminosity.

As expected the signal is slightly affected by this cuts whereas backgrounds (especially \(t\overline{t}\)) are strongly reduced when \(P_{thr}\) diminishes. A similar effect occurs also at high luminosity.

In principle one would apply a threshold as-low-as-possible on extra jet activity. However reconstructing jets with a too low \(P_{T}\) could be critical for ATLAS. We choose \(P_{T}>15\) GeV for low luminosity and \(P_{T}>25\) GeV for high luminosity which are expected to be safe values as described in section

4.

The increase of \(P_{thr}\) to 25 GeV at high luminosity is dictated by the extra contribution to \(P_{T}\) due to pile-up events as it is suggested by the full simulation study (see figure 16 in section 4.4).

Tables 6 and 7 report the number of events which pass the veto after central cuts for data acquisition at high and low luminosity.

Figure 9: Big cone mass (after \(P_{T}\) cut on leptonic W) for signal and backgrounds at high (a) and low (b) luminosity. Distributions are normalized to 1.

### Forward jet Tagging

Finally we exploit the "forward" (\(|\eta|>2\)) jet production which is the peculiar signature of vector boson fusion. To benefit from this signature we require the presence of two jets, one with \(\eta>2\) and another with \(\eta<-2\), whose energy is above the threshold \(E_{Tag}\) and whose transverse momentum is above 15 GeV (\(P_{T}^{fcut}\)). This procedure of forward tagging greatly diminishes the backgrounds and still keeps a large percentage of the signal both at low and high luminosity.

In tables 8 and 9 we report the number of events we expect after central cuts, veto and double forward jet tagging as a function of \(E_{tag}\), at high and low luminosity respectively.

Figure 10: Veto efficiency, after central cuts, as a function of the \(E_{T}\) threshold for signal and backgrounds at low luminosity.

### Higgs Mass reconstruction

The final step is to reconstruct the Higgs mass from the system composed of muon, neutrino (\(P_{T}^{Miss}\)) and Hadronic W (big cone).

The neutrino longitudinal momentum is obtained by constraining the invariant mass of the \(\mu\,\nu\) system to be the nominal W mass (\(M_{W}\)=80.33 GeV). This condition provides us with a second degree equation whose two solutions are:

\[P_{L\nu}=\frac{1}{2P_{Tl}^{2}}\Bigg{[}P_{Ll}(m_{W}^{2}+2\vec{P}_{Tl}\cdot\vec{ P}_{T\nu})\pm E_{l}\sqrt{(m_{W}^{2}+2\vec{P}_{Tl}\cdot\vec{P}_{T\nu})^{2}-4P_{T \nu}^{2}P_{Tl}^{2}}\ \Bigg{]} \tag{1}\]

We choose the smaller solution as it agrees better with that of the neutrino generated by PYTHIA.

We can finally reconstruct Higgs mass both at high and at low luminosity and the results are reported in figures 11 and 12.

From these figures we see that a clear Higgs signal is visible above the background both at high and low luminosity.

Full Simulation of the 600 GeV Higgs

All the results presented so far are achieved using the ATLFAST particle level simulation. However, there are some important points we can use to check how well the predictions of the fast simulation are reproduced by the ATLAS full simulation:

* the \(W\to jj\) reconstruction;
* the veto on central jets ;
* the forward jet tagging.

The analysis was carried out both at low and high luminosity for the signal events.

The full simulation was not performed for the background because the systematics linked to the W+jets and \(\mathrm{t}\overline{\mathrm{t}}\) generation is expected to be much bigger than fine detector effects.

### Simulation of the Events

We simulated events using the 96_12 version of DICE [13] compiled at CERN for HP-UX 9.0 and copied in Pisa on an HP D270. We applied no kinematic cuts when generating events with PYTHIA and we selected muons as final state leptons to save the CPU time needed to propagate electrons inside the EM calorimeter.

Footnote 2: This was the latest version available when the generation of this events sample began.

The full ATLAS calorimetry (up to the forward region) has been simulated and the muon system simulation was switched off as the muon reconstruction is not critical for our purposes (\(P_{T}(\mu)>50\) GeV) and CPU demanding. As a datacard we used the standard _calo.datacard_ which can be found in the official 96_12 software area. We generated 4,470 events during one year, spending about 50 minutes per event.

### Event Reconstruction

Events have been reconstructed using the 96_12 version of ATRECON [13] for calorimeter information. For the muons we took the 4-vector of muonsfrom PYTHIA and we applied a smearing using the resolution foreseen by combining the muon spectrometer and the inner detector. Moreover we required muons to be isolated, i.e. we selected events with no jets with \(P_{T}>15\) GeV within a cone in \(\Delta\)R = 0.4 from the muon.

To reconstruct jets we used the same algorithms used for particle level studies (see section 3.1) to compare the results directly. As input to those algorithms we used the energy deposited in each calorimeter cell contained in the array _comb ener_. Since the calorimeters in ATRECON are calibrated to the electron energy scale we need to rescale the calorimeters energy information by a factor \(\alpha=1.2\) which we found to be optimal.

The missing momentum \(\hbox{$\,\hbox{$\hbox{$\hbox{$E$\kern-6.0pt\lower-0.43pt\hbox{/}}}_{\rm T}$}$}\) has been defined using the _emis_ variables provided by ATRECON. From this quantity we have to subtract off the muon momentum which is undetected by the calorimeters. To test that this reconstruction is correctly working we report in figure 13 the transverse mass of the system muon-missing momentum showing a nice peak at \(m_{\,W}\).

### Pile-up Addition.

Full simulation study was performed at different luminosities: 2.3 interaction/crossing (\(L=10^{33}\)cm\({}^{-2}\)s\({}^{-1}\)) and 23 interactions/crossing (\(L=10^{34}\)cm\({}^{-2}\)s\({}^{-1}\)) which is the luminosity we hope to reach after the first three years of data taking.

In the second case each signal event is accompanied by many other Minimum Bias events. To take this into account, we used a sample of 5,000 MB events3 simulated for the full calorimetry excluding the forward region and taking into account the LAr shaping function. The addition takes place at tower level summing the contribution from pile-up to the calorimeter grid.

Footnote 3: This sample of events can be found in _/afs/in2p3r.fr/group/atlas/simon/minbias.data_ and have been produced by S. Simions.

In the high luminosity case a large number of cells have low transverse energy deposits (\(<1\) GeV) due to soft MB contribution. Other studies [14] show that we can get rid of this by applying \(P_{T}\) cuts on cells. We decided to use a \(P_{T}>1\) GeV cut for cells at \(|\eta|<2\), while we used a \(P_{T}>2\) GeV cut for cells at \(|\eta|>2\).

### Reconstruction of \(W\to jj\)

The reconstruction of the mass of the hadronically decaying W is performed using the same procedure of particle level i.e. the cells within \(\Delta R\)=0.8 cluster are summed up as massless particles. We expect some differences coming from the simulation of hadronic showers implemented in DICE, but not in ATLFAST. In figure 14-a (full line) we show the invariant mass reconstructed at low luminosity. We see that distribution does not peak at 80 GeV and the width is bigger than the one obtained with the particle level simulation. In fact the reconstructed mass depends on the \(P_{T}\) of the \(W\)[15] as shown in figure 14-b. This dependence is due to the procedure we use to evaluate the invariant mass of the big cone together with the showering broadening effects included in the full simulation. In the full simulation of our calorimeter each particle is not hitting just one tower as we assume in the particle level

Figure 13: Transverse mass of the system charged lepton-neutrino. As we expect we have a Jacobian peak around 80 GeV which is the nominal W mass.

simulation. This results in an invariant mass increasing with the energy of the jet.

By fitting this dependence with a straight line we can correct the \(W\) reconstructed mass, obtaining the result shown in figure 14-a (dashed line) which is similar to what we get for particle level studies (see figure 9).

The high luminosity results are shown in figure 15. The reconstructed mass is now lower due to the \(P_{T}\) cut we applied on calorimeter towers, but the \(P_{T}\) dependence is still present.

The \(P_{T}\) correction to the reconstructed mass is important since it narrows the distribution improving the rejection against non resonant background as W+jets.

Experimentally this correction can be extracted from the semileptonic, double-tagged top events as control sample [16].

Figure 14: Left: reconstructed W mass using the ”big-cone” algorithm in the full simulation low luminosity case. Full line is before applying any correction. Dashed line is after applying corrections for the reconstructed \(P_{T}\). Right: Dependence of the reconstructed W mass on the \(P_{T}\) of the object. This dependence is used to correct the W mass.

### Veto Efficiency

As discussed in section 3.4 it is very important to apply a veto on extra-jet activity to strongly reject the contribution from \(t\overline{t}\) background. We discussed how a "as low as possible" veto threshold should be used. To quantify the lowest threshold we can reach we have to switch to the full simulation which provides a detailed description of low \(P_{T}\) jets.

In figure 16 we report the veto efficiency vs. the \(P_{T}\) threshold applied. Full simulation results are compared with particle level ones, showing a tendency to have a slightly lower efficiency. From this plot we can claim that a threshold in the range \(10\div 15\) GeV can be applied at low luminosity. This is in agreement with the \(15\) GeV we used also for particle level. Full simulation results are systematically lower than particle level ones: this can be ascribed to the systematic uncertainty in redefining the absolute energy scale of the calorimeter.

At high luminosity the situation becomes more difficult: we suffer from a \(P_{T}\) contribution of real jets coming from minimum bias interactions. A

Figure 15: Left: reconstructed W mass using the ”big-cone” algorithm in the full simulation high luminosity case. Full line is before applying any correction. Dashed line is after applying corrections for the reconstructed \(P_{T}\). Right: Dependence of the reconstructed W mass on the \(P_{T}\) of the object. This dependence is used to correct the W mass.

true Higgs event (passing our low-luminosity selection) can be accompanied by a jet coming from another interaction and, for this reason, discarded. In figure 16 we show also how this effect becomes overwhelming when \(P_{T}<25\) GeV, while, for \(P_{T}>25\) GeV the low and high luminosity cases give roughly the same efficiencies. Thus the 25 GeV threshold used at particle level in the high luminosity scenario is well justified.

### Forward Tagging Efficiency

In section 3 we showed how the capability of tagging jets in the forward direction plays a key role in disentangling signal from QCD backgrounds.

Two caveats:

Figure 16: Veto efficiency vs. threshold applied. We report the results obtained with particle level simulation, ATLAS full simulation in the low luminosity and high luminosity scenarios. Full simulation efficiencies are sistematically lower than those at particle level (see text).

* The reconstruction of the forward calorimeter in the ATRECON version used is projective, while the read-out of this calorimeter will not be. In any case it has been shown that the performances are not affected using a non-projective read-out.
* The simulation of the pile-up used is limited in \(\eta\) i.e. the forward calorimeter is not included. Thus the results we present refer just to the low luminosity scenario.

In figure 17 we present the efficiency of reconstructing forward jets with the ATLAS full simulation. The results are in a good agreement with the ones obtained using ATLFAST.

Figure 17: Forward tagging efficiency vs. threshold applied. Here we report the values obtained with the particle level simulation and the full simulation in the low luminisity scenario.

### Effects contributing to Higgs mass reconstruction

A 600 GeV Higgs has a sizeable width: \(\Gamma_{H}\sim 120\) GeV. It is therefore interesting to compare it with the experimental width with which the mass can be measured. As the width is a half maximum information, we must rescale it into the mean for the corresponding gaussian distribution, which is the one used for measures. So we redefine

\[\Gamma_{H}^{Nat}\,=\,\Gamma_{H}/(2\sqrt{2\log 2}) \tag{2}\]

For \(M_{H}=600\) GeV, \(\Gamma_{H}^{Nat}\sim\) 51 GeV.

Tables 10 and 11 show the different contribution to the Higgs experimental width. When we "switch on" an effect we put into the reconstructed Higgs mass the reconstructed variable we refer to, "switching off" an effect means using the generation value for that variable.

Hadronic W effect is obtained by an event-by-event subtraction of the fully partonic Higgs mass from the one in which only this effect is switched on.

We kept the smearing due to the hadronic W mass reconstruction and we switched on the \(\Pgt\) and the \(P_{L}^{\nu}\) ( one at the time) to evaluate their contribution to the Higgs width.

Finally the three effects are all switched on in order to evaluate their global effect on the Higgs width

The main contribution comes from the longitudinal momentum of the neutrino and figures 18 and 19 show how this effect is kept into account: the parton level, particle level and full simulation mass distributions are shown.

Instrumental effects affecting the Higgs width are of the same order of magnitude as the natural width. Therefore a careful understanding of the resolution in measuring the physical quantities ( \(P_{L}^{\nu}\), \(P_{T}^{Miss}\), \(W\to jj\)) will be needed to extract the natural width.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|} \hline Contributions & Particle Level & Full Simulation \\ \hline \(W\to jj\) & 10.3 GeV & 14.8 GeV \\ \hline \(\Pgt\) & 15.5 GeV & 16.0 GeV \\ \hline \(P_{L}^{\nu}\) & 29.3 GeV & 29.0 GeV \\ \hline Total & 37 GeV & 40 GeV \\ \hline \end{tabular}

## 5 Atlfast2 Simulation of the 300 GeV Higgs

We generated 300 GeV Higgs event samples for both low luminosity and high luminosity (with pile-up included) runs. The event selection criteria were similar to the analysis for the 600 GeV Higgs. A double forward jet tag was necessary to substantially improve the signal over background ratio.

The main problem in the study of a lower mass Higgs comes from the background four-body invariant mass tending to peak in the same Higgs signal region, due to the bias of the lepton and W \(P_{T}\) cuts. In order to separate the background and signal mass distributions we kept the lepton and W \(P_{T}\) cuts as low as possible in the ATLAS detector. At the same time a reasonable S/B ratio, tightening the W mass and the central jet veto cuts has proved essential for the 300 GeV Higgs study. The cut on extra central jets has been studied for different jet \(P_{T}\) cuts for both the low and high luminosity environments. The significance S/\(\sqrt{B}\) was about constant over the range 15-40 GeV for the jet \(P_{T}\) cut, but the S/B ratio did decrease with raising the veto threshold.

Another difference from the 600 GeV Higgs was the absence of a big cone to study the two jets from the W decay, due to the smaller decay boost. However, the two jets are still expected to be not very far in the \(\eta\)-\(\phi\) space, and a \(\Delta R(j_{1},j_{2})=\sqrt{\Delta^{2}\eta+\Delta^{2}\phi}<1.8\) cut has been applied.

The full simulation was not performed for the backgrounds because the systematics linked to the W+jets and t\(\overline{t}\) generation is expected to be much larger than fine detector effects.

### The 300 GeV Higgs samples

The samples we used for 300 GeV analysis are in table 12; generation cuts have the same meaning as in table 1.

Table 12 summarizes the samples used for this analysis.

### Low luminosity

The number of expected events for a H(300)\(\rightarrow\)WW signal after 3\(\cdot\)10\({}^{4}\) pb\({}^{-1}\) at low luminosity is shown in table 13 together with the two main backgrounds, when central cuts only were applied. A cut of 25 GeV on the charged lepton\({\rm P}_{T}\) and the missing \({\rm E}_{T}\) were used 4, as well as a 50 GeV cut on the two reconstructed W \({\rm P}_{T}\)s. Fig. 20 shows some kinematic variable distributions for the 300 GeV Higgs at low luminosity (no pile-up included), compared to the background distributions. In order to improve the S/B ratio we selected events with \(\Delta{\rm R}(j_{1},j_{2})<\)1.8 and within a narrow di-jet invariant mass window of \(\pm\)10 GeV around the expected W mass from the Higgs decay. In addition, the veto on extra central jets with \({\rm P}_{T}\) greater than 20 GeV drastically reduces the \(t\overline{t}\) background, which would otherwise be only partially reduced by the double forward jet tag.

Footnote 4: They are referred to as \(P_{T}^{\,l\epsilon p}\) in table 13

After two forward jets with \({\rm E}_{T}>\)600 GeV were required, we obtained a signal over background ratio of about 20% (table 14). The reconstructed Higgs mass distribution in shown in fig. 21. Signal plus background are shown with error bars, the solid histogram represents the background only. The distributions have been normalized to the expected number of events after 3\(\cdot\)10\({}^{4}\) pb\({}^{-1}\) at low luminosity.

### High luminosity

For a high luminosity run we maintained low \({\rm P}_{T}\) cuts in order to have some chance to separate the signal peak from the background. Due to the presence of pile-up we were however forced to increase the mass window in the di-jet mass distribution to \(\pm\)15 GeV, and to increase the jet veto cut to at least 25 GeV (table 15).

The distributions have been normalized to 1.

Table 16 reports the expected rates and significances for the H(300)\(\rightarrow\)WW signal after a double forward jet tag, for a high luminosity run with an integrated luminosity of \(10^{5}\) pb\({}^{-1}\). When two forward jets with E\({}_{T}>\)600 GeV were required, we obtained a signal over background ratio of about 6%. The reconstructed Higgs mass distribution for a high luminosity run is shown in fig. 22.

From figures 22 and 21 we see that the signal peaks at slightly higher values than the background. Therefore a detailed knowledge of the background size and shape is needed for a stand-alone discovery claim. Moreover the signal width (\(\sim\) 30 GeV) is much larger than the natural Higgs width (\(\sim\) 6 GeV).

Table 16: Expected rates and significances for the H(300)\(\rightarrow\)WW signal after a double forward jet tag. The rates have been computed for a high luminosity run with an integrated luminosity of \(10^{5}\) pb\({}^{-1}\) and pile–up included. Efficiency for each threshold is referred to the number of events with no threshold, that is those which pass the veto.

Conclusions

We studied the possibility to observe, in ATLAS, a 600 GeV Higgs boson which decays into \(\mathrm{WW}\rightarrow\mathrm{l}\nu\mathrm{jj}\). This study was performed at particle level with ATLFAST2 both at low and high luminosity. The optimization of the hadronically decaying \(\mathrm{W}\) reconstruction and of the central cuts and the forward jet tagging was performed, showing that a 600 GeV Higgs boson can be observed over \(\mathrm{W}\)+\(\mathrm{jj}\) and \(t\overline{t}\) background after 3 years of data taking at low luminosity.

The results obtained from a full simulation of the signal events are in good agreement with ATLFAST predictions. In particular this comparison successfully addressed the following crucial points:

* Quality of \(\mathrm{W}\)+\(\mathrm{jj}\) reconstruction
* Efficiency of the central jet veto cut
* Efficiency of the forward jet tagging

The study of the Higgs observability through Boson Pair Fusion production and decay was extended down to the mass of 300 GeV. As expected, here the situation is less favourable, as signal and background tend to peak at the same value. However we have, also at this lower mass, evidence of a significant excess of signal over background which can usefully complement the Higgs observation performed in other more favourable channels.

We would like to thank D. Cavalli for providing us with all informations needed for pile-up addition in full simulation events. We also thank P. Loch for discussions regarding the forward tagging and forward calorimeter.

We thank G. Azuelos and L.Poggioli for useful discussions.
