**Abstract**

One of the not yet fully optimized geometry parameter in the ATLAS forward calorimeter (FCal) is the radius \(R_{t}\) of the tube electrodes. The response of the electromagnetic FCal to electrons with 50, 100 and 200 GeV/\(c\) momenta has been simulated in order to determine \(R_{t}\) such that the best possible energy resolution is achieved. Within the already well defined overall read out structure (centre-to-centre distance of 7.5 mm and the gap width of 250 \(\mu\)m) the optimal \(R_{t}\) was found to be 2.652 mm. The value of 2.625 mm presently used in the prototype is very close to the optimum found in this study.

## 1 Introduction

The forward calorimeter (FCal) in ATLAS has one liquid argon/copper electromagnetic:and two liquid argon/tungsten hadronic modules per end, all with tube/rod electrodes with a tubular active gap (cylindrical shells), see fig.1. The centre-to-centre distance between the electrodes and the gap size have already been optimized for the electromagnetic (elm) and each hadronic module individually. It is obvious that the signal in this calorimeter depends on these two parameters and the tube radius. A brief simulation study has been conducted to determine the optimal choice for this radius in the elm FCal. The results are reported in the remainder of this note after a brief description of the simulation conditions and parameters.

## 2 Electron Simulations

The most sensitive variable that can be used to optimize the tube radius is the electron energy resolution, which is directly related to the sampling fraction and frequency. Thesetwo parameters only depend on the tube radius, in a given tube matrix with a fixed centre-to-centre distance (\(7.5\) mm), a fixed gap width (\(250\)\(\mu\)m) and a fixed choice of absorber (copper) and active medium (liquid argon). Electron response simulations within the GEANT 3.21 framework are used to study this dependence at various input energies.

The geometrical model in the simulation is based on a simplified FCal with full lateral containment for electromagnetic showers (\(30\times 30\) cm\({}^{2}\) quadratic front face), but with the design depth of \(45\) cm. The electrodes are described by a copper cylinder surrounded by a liquid argon shell. About \(1800\) of these units are positioned inside a copper absorber matrix following the hexagonal symmetry indicated in fig.1. The acceptance of this FCal model for electrons is certainly sufficient for this study, as can be seen in fig.2: the fraction of energy deposited inside the model for all tested simulation cuts is very close to \(100\%\) (fig.2(a)). The

shower profiles also indicate full lateral acceptance (fig.2(b)) and a small longitudinal leakage (fig.2(c),(d)), rather independent of the chosen simulation cuts. It is noticeable, though, that the lateral profile shows relatively strong dependencies on simulation cuts at smaller distances to the shower axis. Concerning full lateral acceptance at large distances from the shower axis, no simulation cut dependence can be observed for the chosen model size.

Electrons have been generated with 50, 100 and 200 GeV/\(c\) momenta. The impact direction has been chosen such that the particles seem to come from the ATLAS vertex and hit a point on the radius of largest acceptance of the elm FCal, corresponding to a polar angle of about 3\({}^{\circ}\) in the Technical Proposal design. The impact points are equally distributed on the diamond-shaped area corresponding to one unit cell (fig.1). Simulation cuts, i.e. energy thresholds for electron and photon tracking in GEANT, are generally set to 1 MeV for both particle types. Some special simulations with 10 keV, 100 keV and 2 MeV cuts have been produced at 100 GeV input energy to understand the effect of these thresholds on the shower shapes (fig.2), the signal and the energy resolution (below). The tube radius has been varied between 0.5 and 3.0 mm, the first value being very impractical and therefore of academic interest only, and the last being the largest practical radius for the given centre-to-centre distance of 7.5 mm.

The simulated signal is just the energy \(E_{vis}\) deposited in the liquid argon. This and the total energy \(E_{dep}\) deposited inside the calorimeter are stored event by event, together with the actual impact position and electron momentum components. The studied variable is the sampling fraction \(S\) defined for each event as

\[S=\frac{E_{vis}}{E_{dep}}\]

Note that \(E_{dep}\) for the vast majority of the events is identical to the incoming energy \(E_{beam}\). See also fig.2(a) for the average behaviour.

## 3 Results

The distribution of the sampling fraction \(S\) is shown in fig.3 for different electron energies and tube radii \(R_{t}\). The generally observed effect of reduced widths/tails for increasing \(R_{t}\) down to some minimum after which the signal fluctuations increase again can be quantified by the standard deviations (_rms_) \(V\) of the distributions. Fig.4(b) shows the variation of \(V\) with \(R_{t}\). Note that the average sampling fraction (\(S\)) is also depending on \(R_{t}\) in a straight forward way: the sampling fraction increases, at least at first order, linearly with the liquid argon volume and therefore directly proportional to \(R_{t}\), see fig.4(a). A measure for the relative energy resolution is then given by the ratio \(V/\left<S\right>\). The tube radius dependence of this ratio is finally shown for different electron energies in fig.4(c). It has to be pointed out that the energy resolution as defined here is _not_ the best possible, because no impact point corrections have been applied (usually needed due to the inhomogeneous front face of the calorimeter).

The optimal tube radius \(R_{t}^{opt}\) is the one where the best possible relative energy resolution is reached. It can be found analytically by a minimum search for \(V(R_{t})/\left<S(R_{t})\right>\), which can Figure 3: _Distributions of the sampling fraction \(S\) for electrons in the elm FCal, for different tube radii (in mm) and particle energies._

The radius dependence of the standard deviation \(V\) of the corresponding distributions is shown in (**b**) for different electron energies and simulation cuts. The uncorrected relative energy resolution \(V/\left\langle S\right\rangle\) as function of \(R_{t}\) is displayed in (**c**), again for different beam energies and cuts. The solid curve presents the result of a third order polynomial fit to the \(100\) GeV points. The light grey area indicates the optimal \(R_{t}\) and its error range.

be parameterized as a third order polynomial function, see fig.4. From this the optimal tube radius for the elm FCal has been determined using the signal for 100 GeV electrons:

\[R_{t}^{opt}=(2.652\pm 0.049)\;\mathrm{mm}\]

The error has been calculated from the errors on the fitted parameters. The minimum is also relatively flat around \(2.5\;\mathrm{mm}\lesssim R_{t}\lesssim 2.7\;\mathrm{mm}\). This makes the present choice of \(R_{t}=2.625\) mm for the elm FCal prototype, which is favoured with respect to technical and economical aspects, acceptable. Note that this conclusion is also qualitatively supported by the signals from 50 and 200 GeV electrons.

## 4 Conclusion and outlook

A short study has been conducted to determine the optimal tube radius in the elm FCal within the given geometrical constraints of an electrode centre-to-centre distance of 7.5 mm and a gap width of 250 \(\mu\)m. The electron energy resolution has been simulated for different tube radii \(R_{t}\) in a model of this calorimeter with full lateral acceptance at design depth (45 cm). The present choice of \(R_{t}=2.625\) mm for the elm FCal prototype has been found to be comparable within the errors with the optimal value \(R_{t}^{opt}=2.652\) mm determined by the simulations. This conclusion is independent of the electron energy, at least within the limits of this study (\(50-200\) GeV).

The same type of study for the hadronic FCal modules, where the gap width and the electrode distances are larger, is still pending (this requires a non-negligible amount of CPU time). It is likely, though, that the dependence of the pion energy resolution on \(R_{t}\) is much weaker than the one for electrons. In any case it seems to be necessary to extend this study and include electron and pion signals in standalone simulations (separately for each hadronic module) and pion signals in the full FCal.
