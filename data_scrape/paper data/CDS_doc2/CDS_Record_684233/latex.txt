###### Abstract

The front end electronics to be installed on ATLAS MDTs will include an ADC which can be used for time slewing corrections or for particle identification via \(\frac{dE}{dx}\) measurements. We investigated how well the MDTs will be able to identify heavy, slowly moving particles predicted by some supersymmetry models [eg. 1]. This method allows good separation of exotic particles from reconstructed muons if the exotic particles have \(2<\beta\gamma<10\). If the exotic particles have \(\beta\gamma<0.8\), this method allows excellent separation.

## 1 Detector Electronics

The MDT (Monitored Drift Tube) signals are amplified and processed by the MDT-ASD (Amplifier Shaper Discriminator) front-end [5]. The timing information carried by the MDT-ASD output signal is recorded in the AMT (Atlas Muon TDC) time-to-digital converter [2].

The MDT-ASD channel contains a dual-slope Wilkinson circuit which performs pulse width encoding of the signal charge. The width of the Wilkinson output pulse is proportional to the integral of the muon signal (the total charge deposit) within a 10-50 nanosecond programmable gate after the initial threshold crossing. The AMT records this pulse width with a bin size of 0.78 ns [2]. If the MDT-ASD is programmed to produce output pulses in the range of 0-200 ns, then the combination of the MDT-ASD and the AMT chip represents a charge ADC with a resolution of 8 bits.

Non-systematic errors in the charge measurement due to electronics noise in the MDT-ASD's and AMT's and quantization errors have been determined. Variations in the pulse width at the MDT-ASD output are typically below 600 ps RMS, depending on signal amplitude and integration gate width. Figure 1 shows the MDT-ASD Wilkinson noise versus threshold overdrive in percent of the measured charge for 3 short integration gate widths. The pulse width conversion in the AMT shows a RMS error of 430 ps including quantizationerror. Hence, the resulting total error, covering all noise sources from the front-end down to the A/D conversion, stays under \(\sim\)800 ps RMS. This number corresponds to a typical error of well below 1% of the measured charge for the vast majority of signals [5].

All systematic charge measurement errors such as converter non-linearities and channel-to-channel variations can be calibrated out using the MDT-ASD's programmable test pulse injection system.

We therefore expect that the largest systematic charge measurement errors will be due to detector and B-field inhomogeneities. For calibration of these the detector has to be divided into areas similar to the auto-calibration areas for determination of the space-drift-time relations.

## 2 Simulation Procedure

We use Garfield [6] to simulate the fundamental physics of the MDTs including primary and secondary ionization, electron and ion drift, and the avalanche. Our operating parameters are those currently envisioned for ATLAS: the wire voltage is 3.08 kV, the gas is 93% \(\mathrm{Ar},7\%\)\(\mathrm{CO}_{2}\), at a pressure of 3 bars. This corresponds to a gas gain of 2x10\({}^{4}\)[3].

Figure 1: Measured Wilkinson conversion error as a function of input signal charge. The discriminator threshold is set to its nominal value corresponding to about 6 fC. Note the decrease in noise for longer integration gates.

Garfield also adds the thermal noise of the tube termination resistor and the front end amplifier response. We calculated amplifier response to a \(\delta\) function input using HSPICE [4] simulations of the final version of the MDT-ASD chip.

At this point we numerically integrate the amplifier output signal for various lengths of time after the initial threshold crossing. The actual MDT-ASD's Wilkinson ADC will have a nonlinear response curve and it will have channel-to-channel variations. However, it will be possible to calibrate out both of these effects using the ADC's test pulse injection capability.

In order to parameterize effects such as gas gain variations due to space charge, temperature variations, and possible calibration errors, we add measurement error to each measurement in addition to the thermal noise of the tube termination resistor, which is already included in the simulation:

\[q_{i}=q_{i}+\delta q_{i} \tag{1}\]

where \(\delta q_{i}\) is a Gaussian random number with a mean of zero and a sigma of some fraction of \(q_{i}\). See section 2.2 for an example of the effect of this operation.

We correct for variations in charge deposit as a function of the distance from the track to the tube wire. See section 2.1 for further details.

A given track will pass through \(\sim 25\) drift tubes in the muon spectrometer. Therefore we randomly choose 25 single tube signals from a pool of \(\sim 4000\) with a uniform distribution in radius. Since the charge deposit distribution has a long tail towards large deposit, we compute the 80% truncated mean of the 25 signals, omitting the five signals with the largest charge deposit.

The truncated mean is then our estimator for the particle identification. We generate a distribution of 5000 estimators and this distribution is very close to Gaussian because of the central limit theorem. We define \(\mu\) and \(\sigma_{\mu}^{2}\) to be the mean and variance of this distribution of estimators. Both of these quantities are functions of \(\beta\gamma\), where \(\beta=v/c\) and \(\gamma=(1-\beta^{2})^{-1/2}\)

Finally, we fit a parameterization of the Bethe-Bloch formula for the ionization energy loss of a high energy particle to \(\mu\) and \(\sigma_{\mu}\) as a function of \(\beta\gamma\). See section 2.3 for further discussion of the details of this fit.

With this parameterization of \(\mu\) and \(\sigma_{\mu}\), we can calculate how well the ATLAS MDT's will be able to separate reconstructed muons from heavy, slowly moving, exotic particles.

### Track Position Correction

The ADC measurements depend on the distance from the track to the wire. In order to correct for this variation, we divide the tube into 15 radial bins and find the median charge deposit in each bin. The reason for using the median instead of the mean is that the distribution of ADC values at a specific radius has a long tail toward large values, characteristic of the Landau distribution. Using the median makes the method stable against outlier points.

Figure 2 shows a sample of ADC values as a function of radius along with the median in each radial bin as described above. We fit a 4th order polynomial

through these points and then divide all ADC values by this function. The figure also shows the ADC values after making this correction. As expected, the radial dependence has been removed.

In order to be useful and realistic, this correction must not depend on the particle energy. Figure 3 shows the result of correcting the data for \(\beta\gamma=1.1\) with the correction function generated with \(\beta\gamma=3.4\) data. As expected, the same correction function removes the radius dependence for both particle energies.

Finally, figure 4 shows the effect of applying the position correction to the

Figure 2: ADC Values before and after applying the position correction. For this dataset, \(\beta\gamma\)=3.4, the ADC gate is 10 ns, and there is no measurement error added. The fitted function is a 4th order polynomial. We divide all ADC values by this polynomial. Applying this correction removes the radial dependence of the ADC values. See section 2.1 for further details.

Figure 3: ADC values for a particle with \(\beta\gamma\)=1.1 corrected with the polynomial derived from the data for \(\beta\gamma\)=3.4. The ADC gate is 10 ns and there is no measurement error added. The upper plot shows the \(\beta\gamma\)=1.1 data along with the correction function for the \(\beta\gamma\)=3.4 data. The lower plot shows the \(\beta\gamma\)=1.1 data after the correction, along with the median in each radial bin. The medians show little scatter around a straight line in the lower plot, indicating that this correction is independent of the incident particle energy.

estimator distribution. This correction reduces the width of each Gaussian distribution and therefore enhances our ability to separate particles with different \(\beta\gamma\).

### Effect of Charge Measurement Errors

Figure 5 shows the effect of adding measurement error to the ADC values before computing the estimator. Up to a measurement error of 10%, the effect is modest because the physical variations in the charge deposit dominate. At 20%, the measurement error dominates and degrades our ability to separate particles.

### Parameterization of the Estimator's Energy Dependence

With a functional form for \(\mu\) and \(\sigma_{\mu}\) as a function of energy, we can compute the separation power for any two incident particle energies using this method. Separation power is defined as:

\[s=\frac{\mu_{1}-\mu_{2}}{\frac{1}{2}(\sigma_{\mu_{1}}+\sigma_{\mu_{2}})} \tag{2}\]

where \(\mu_{1}\), \(\sigma_{1}\) and \(\mu_{2}\), \(\sigma_{2}\) are the mean, sigma of the two estimator distributions.

To give a feeling for the meaning of this parameter, table 3 shows the for different separation powers.

In order to give an idea of the significance of the separation power, we also compute the impurity of our sample of hypothetical SUSY (supersymmetry) particles. Given our distribution of estimators of 10 GeV reconstructed muons and SUSY particles, we must choose a threshold for estimator values beyond which we consider the particle to be a SUSY particle.

By changing this threshold, it is possible to make the sample impurity as small as desired, at a loss of efficiency. We adopt a simple scheme where the threshold is set to the point where the signal and background distributions cross. Therefore above the threshold we expect there to be more signal events than background events for any given estimator value.

Then the impurity is:

\[\text{Impurity}=\frac{\int_{-\infty}^{c}(1/\sigma_{b})\exp(\frac{-(x-\mu_{b} )^{2}}{2\sigma_{b}^{2}})\,dx}{\int_{-\infty}^{c}(1/\sigma_{s})\exp(\frac{-(x- \mu_{s})^{2}}{2\sigma_{s}^{2}})+(1/\sigma_{b})\exp(\frac{-(x-\mu_{b})^{2}}{2 \sigma_{b}^{2}})\,dx} \tag{3}\]

where \(\exp(x)=e^{x}\), \(c\) is the threshold for counting the event as a signal event, \(\mu_{s}\), and \(\sigma_{s}^{2}\) are the mean and variance of the distribution of estimators for signal events, and \(\mu_{b}\), and \(\sigma_{b}^{2}\) are the mean and variance of the distribution of estimators for background events (in our case, 10 GeV muons). This expression is valid when \(\mu_{s}<\mu_{b}\). When \(\mu_{s}>\mu_{b}\), the limits of integration change from \(-\infty,c\) to \(c,\infty\).

Figure 4: The effect of the position correction on the distribution of estimators. The ADC gate is 10 ns and there is no measurement error added. The peak on the left is due a particle with \(\beta\gamma\)=3.4 while the peak on the right is due to a particle with \(\beta\gamma\)=1.1. Applying the position correction to the ADC values decreases the overlap of the two Gaussian distributions and increases the separation power. In this case the separation power goes from 3.61 to 3.89 as a result of applying this correction. Separation power is defined by equation 2. See section 2.1 for further details on the position correction.

Figure 5: The effect of measurement error on the distribution of estimators. The ADC gate is 10 ns, and the two overlapping Gaussian distribution are due to particles with \(\beta\gamma\)=1.1 and 3.4. Applying 20% measurement error decreases the separation power from 3.89 to 2.78 in this case. Separation power is defined by equation 2. The actual charge measurement error due to the electronics is expected to be less than 1%, as shown in figure 1 and discussed in section 1. See section 2 for a discussion of measurement error.

Table 2: Fit parameters for \(\sigma_{\mu}\) as a function of energy for different gate lengths and measurement error values. The definition of \(\sigma_{\mu}\) is in section 2 and our parameterization is given by equation 5Results

Figure 6 shows examples of \(\mu\) as a function of energy for different gate values, along with our fitted functions.

Charge measurements from the ADC provide quite good separation of particles with different mean charge deposit even though the gate length is a small fraction of the total drift time. Figure 7 shows that the fraction of charge collected during a short ADC gate is higher than one might expect. This is because of the nonlinear radius-drift time relationship of Ar CO\({}_{2}\). The drift velocity is highest close to the wire so much of the charge arrives at the wire quickly, while the charge near the tube wall takes a very long time to arrive at the wire.

Figures 8-10 show the ability of this method to separate particles of different energies from 10 GeV muons (\(\beta\gamma=103\)).

The most relevant question for those working on extensions to the standard model is whether or not it will be possible to detect heavy exotic particles using the muon spectrometer. Figure 11 shows the expected \(\beta\gamma\) distribution for heavy staus as calculated by Ambrosanio et al. [1]. It will be impossible to distinguish staus with \(1<\beta\gamma<2\), but as shown in figure 11, Ambrosanio et al. [1] expect a significant fraction of staus to be produced with \(2<\beta\gamma<10\). In addition, there may be a small number produced with \(\beta\gamma<0.8\), where the separation power of this method is excellent.

## 4 Conclusion

We performed a full simulation of the ATLAS MDT signals for various particle energies, including the fundamental physics of charge deposit as well as the response of the MDT front end electronics. There are good prospects for particle identification in the range of \(2<\beta\gamma<10\). Tables 1 and 2 give fit parameters for our parameterization of \(\mu\) and \(\sigma_{\mu}\) as a function of \(\beta\gamma\).

Figure 8: Separation power and SUSY impurity as a function of \(\beta\gamma\) with no measurement error added. Separation power is defined by equation 2 and impurity is defined by equation 3. For the region between \(\beta\gamma\)=2 and \(\beta\gamma\)=10, the separation power is quite good. Below \(\beta\gamma\)=0.8 the separation power is extremely good.

Figure 9: Separation power and SUSY impurity as a function of \(\beta\gamma\) with 10% measurement error. Separation power is defined by equation 2 and impurity is defined by equation 3. The separation power is largely unaffected compared to the situation with no measurement error added (figure 8).

Figure 10: Separation power and SUSY impurity as a function of \(\beta\gamma\) with 20% measurement error. Separation power is defined by equation 2 and impurity is defined by equation 3. With this much error, the quality of the method suffers severely. The actual measurement error is expected to be less than 1% for most inputs, as shown in figure 1 and discussed in section 1.
