###### Abstract

Several types of WLS fibres, candidates to be used in the TILECAL/ATLAS detector, were irradiated in a \({}^{60}\)Co \(\gamma\) source. Bicron, Kuraray and Pol.Hi. Tech fibres were exposed to a total dose of \(\sim\)150 Krad. The degradation of light output was measured just after irradiation and followed during several days. The results are presented.

## 1 Introduction

The TILECAL hadronic barrel calorimeter of the ATLAS detector, uses scintillating tiles readout by 1 mm diameter WaveLength-Shifter (WLS) fibres, which transmit the signal to photomultipliers tubes (PMT). Due to the high radiation field predicted for the LHC detectors, degradation of the optical components is expected, so radiation damage experiments are performed in order to test the tolerance to ionising radiation. For the TILECAL at \(\eta=1.2\), the maximum expected dose due to charged particles is about 3 krad/year, and 1 krad/year due to the neutron flux (\(2.0\times 10^{12}cm^{-2}yr^{-1}\)), i.e., about 40 krad for 10 years of LHC operation.

During the last 2 years, several types of new fibres were produced by Bicron, Kuraray and Pol.Hi.Tech. After Kuraray, Bicron and Pol.Hi.Tech, also developed multi-cladding fibres. Very recently Pol.Hi.Tech started the production of WLS fibres using K 27 dopant, already used by Bicron and Kuraray in the BCF91A and Y11 fibres, respectively. Some of these fibres were characterized in what concerns light output and attenuation length [1, 2].

The present work reports the results of radiation damage on some of these new types of fibre.

## 2 Irradiation and experimental setup

A \({}^{60}Co\) source from a radiosterilization facility, _"Unidade de Tecnologias de Radioacao"_in _"Instituto Tecnologico e Nuclear"_ at Lisbon, was used. At 10 cm from the \({}^{60}Co\) source, the intensity is \(>\)20 krad/h, so, in order to have a lower and rather uniform dose rate inside an area of 20x150 cm\({}^{2}\), several shieldings of lead and cooper were used as it is shown in fig. 1.

The test bench is schematically shown in fig. 2. It consists of a X-Y Micro-Control optical table, provided with two independent movements driven by two stepping motors along orthogonal directions (\(\mathbf{X}\) and \(\mathbf{Y}\)). It is complemented by a light readout system. A 3 meters long table is moved in the X direction. This table supports a removable holder that contains the fibers to be tested. Each fiber is positioned in front of the light readout, and the Y motor moves the radiation source along the fiber length. At each position the light output from that fiber

is recorded. The test bench is automatically controlled by a MacIntosh Personal Computer through GPIB interfaces. A dedicated software was developed for this purpose using the LabView1 package.

## 3 Experimental conditions

In the first test, the fibres were irradiated in the central position of the irradiation setup (position \(B\) - dose rate \(\sim\) 0.64 krad/h), shown in fig. 1:

Bicron BCF91A DC from 1995, BCF99-28 DC and BCF99-28, both from 1996; Kuraray Y11(200)MS with 600 ppm of UVA from 1997 production for the Extended Barrel Module 0; Pol.Hi.Tech S248-100 (double cladding fibres) and S048-100 (single cladding fibres), both from the beginning of 1997. All fibres were polished one by one in a cutting machine, and the side opposite to the readout was painted black. Five fibres of each type were tested.

The dose rate for this position is shown in fig. 3. The average in the plateau is about 0.64 Krad/h. The fibres were exposed to \(\gamma\) radiation during a total of 225 hours. It should be noted that the irradiation is not continuous (about 10 to 12 hours per day, and stopping during the weekends). The total dose delivered to the fibres was \(\sim\)144 Krad.

Figure 2: The test bench: a) side view; b) top view.

A second test was performed with new Pol.Hi. Tech double cladding fibres with K27 dopant, produced very recently (September 1997). One set of 3 S250 fibres with 200 ppm of UV Absorber (UVA), and a second set of 3 S250 fibres whithout UVA. The K27 concentration of the second set of fibres is 2 times the concentration of the first set. This (fast) irradiation was performed in position \(A\) (see fig. 1), with a dose rate about 4 times higher than position \(B\), but the total dose was also about 150 Krad.

## 4 Results for the fibres before irradiation

In order to compare the optical properties of fibres from different productions, and control the reproducibility along time, "new" fibres and "old" fibres were tested at the same time. This section summarizes the results obtained for each type of fibre before the irradiation. Table 1 shows the average for 5 fibres of the attenuation length (\(L_{att}\)) taken from one exponential fit between 70 and 170 cm, the light output at 30 cm (\(I(30)\)) and at 170 cm (\(I(170)\)). Fig. 4 shows the light output as a function of the distance to the PMT, for one typical fibre of each type.

The attenuation length of BCF99-28 fibres has lower values (\(\sim\)220 cm), than all the other types of fibres (\(>\)280 cm). Comparing the results for double cladding BCF99-28 and BCF91A fibres, the difference between these two types is in the dopant concentration. The BCF91A has half of the dopant concentration of the BCF99-28 fibres, and this is a factor that can explain the decrease in the

attenuation length [4]. It can be seen that the light output at 30 cm (rather close to the readout PMT) is the same for both types of fibres. The light output at 170 cm, for the double cladding BCF99-28 DC fibres is 32% higher than for the single cladding BCF99-28 fibres.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|} \hline Fiber type & Fibre length (cm) & \(L_{att}\)(cm) & \(I\)(30) a.u. & \(I\)(170) a.u. \\ \hline BCF 99-28 DC (96) & 175 & 223 & 0.850 & 0.381 \\ BCF99-28 (96) & 175 & 211 & 0.703 & 0.288 \\ BCF91-A DC (95) & 190 & 282 & 0.847 & 0.4 24 \\ Y11(200)MS (97) & 190 & 283 & 0.805 & 0.4 28 \\ Y11(200)MS (95) & 190 & 306 & 0.851 & 0.4 65 \\ S248-100 (97) & 190 & 344 & 0.669 & 0.385 \\ S048-100 (97) & 190 & 307 & 0.630 & 0.331 \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 1: The attenuation length taken from one exponential fit between 70 and 170 cm, the light output at 30 cm and at 170 cm are presented, as the average of 5 fibres of each type. The _RMS_ is about 6% or less for the attenuation length and 3% or less for the light output.

and 2 weeks after irradiation, for the S248-100 and S250 fibres. The average of \(R(170)\) is shown in table 2, for the three (or four) measurements done after the end of the irradiation. The distance \(x=170\)\(cm\) is a typical point of the TILECAL calorimeter for radiation damage tests.

All the fibres from Bicron, do not present any observable recovery between 3 hours and 6 days, and the degradation in light output is similar and almost independent of the fibre type. The value of \(I(170)\) is about 85% of the value before irradiation.

The Y11(200)MS fibres present a slight recovery between 3 hours and 1 day, from 81% to 86% of the initial light output, and no further recovery thereafter.

The results presented in this paper are quite similar to those obtained in previous irradiations [3]. There is almost no recovery of the Bicron and Kuraray fibres, which can be explained by the irradiation being performed with a rather low dose rate (0.64 krad/h), and allowing the fibres to recover in part during the test. The \(RMS\) of \(R(170)\) due to fibre to fibre fluctuations and instrumental errors is less than 3.5%.

The situation of Pol.Hi. Tech fibres is different. The S048 and S248 fibres show a slight recovery of 8% between 3 hours and 6 days, from 45% to 53%. Both S250 fibres present a rather strong recovery from 56% to 80% of the initial value in 6 days, and up to 82% - 85% two weeks after the end of irradiation. It

should be stressed that the dose rate during this second test is four times higher (2.52 krad/h) than in the first test.

## 6 Conclusions

Comparing the 1995 and the 1997 productions of the Y11(200)MS Kuraray fibres, it is seen that in 97, the fibres have a light output at \(x=170~{}cm\) about 10% lower than the fibres from the older production. The BCF91A DC Bicron fibres from 95 and the Y11 Kuraray fibres from 97, present a very similar value of the light output. The DC BCF99-28 and S248 fibres, have a similar value of the light output and about 10% lower than that of the BCF91A and Y11 from 97 fibres. The DC BCF99-28 and S248 fibres have 32% and 16% higher light output than the corresponding SC BCF99-28 and S048 fibres.

For the irradiation at a dose rate 0.64 krad/h almost no recover is observed for all types of fibres, this can be due to the rather low dose rate, which can allow the fibres to recover in part during the test. The light output after irradiation is about 85% of the initial value for all types of Bicron and Kuraray fibres,and of the order of 50% for the S048 and S248 Pol.Hi. Tech. The S250 fibres, irradiated at a dose rate of 2.52 krad/h, present a fast and strong recovery due to the much higher dose rate. The light output is \(\sim\)85% of the initial one, after 2 weeks of recovery.

Figure 6: Ratio \(R(170)\), corresponding to table 2.

The Bicron and Kuraray fibres tested have a good resistance to ionising radiation, similar to older productions, and in good agreement with previous results [2, 3]. The Pol.Hi.Tech S250 fibres are more tolerant to ionising radiation than the S048 and S248 fibres.
