**Abstract**

In this paper we discuss \({\cal O}(\alpha^{2})\) QED bremsstrahlung in the \(pp\to Z^{0}/\gamma^{*}\to\ell^{+}\ell^{-}\) channel as a possible background for the intermediate mass Higgs search. We construct exact matrix elements for this process and include them in generator TOPKI, but for practical simulation we propose to use an approximate "hybrid" solution, PYTHIA + PHOTOS. We test its precision by comparison with exact matrix element calculations. We show that the background from this channel to direct Higgs production is completely overwhelmed by direct photon production processes. The only exception is the case of the \(M_{H}\sim M_{Z^{0}}\) region where events with mis-identified electrons are very dangerous. On the other hand the contribution from this channel to the background to associated Higgs production (\(tt\,H\), \(WH\)) is significant.

Introduction

One of the main physics goals of LHC experiments is the discovery of the Higgs boson. The proposed search strategies for the Higgs boson face a serious background problem in the mass region of the so-called intermediate mass Higgs, i.e. 80 GeV \(<M_{H}<\) 130 GeV. The dominant decay channel into a pair of heavy quarks has an overwhelming QCD two-jet background in this region. The rare decay mode \(H\rightarrow\gamma\gamma\) with a branching ratio of \(\sim 2\times 10^{-3}\) is considered as the only potential signal for intermediate Higgs production [1]. The proposed signatures are well-isolated \(\gamma\gamma\) events (direct Higgs production) or \(\gamma\gamma\ell\) events (associated Higgs production) [2].

These signatures suffer, however, from the very large backgrounds coming from different processes where photons can be radiated in the particle _production_ and/or _decay_. The photons contributing to a \(\gamma\gamma\) pair can be produced in many subprocesses of a proton-proton collision. The two photons in a pair can come from the _same_ particle branch, or from \(different\) ones. Moreover, to these backgrounds contribute events with photons faked by jets, \(\pi^{0}\) or electrons.

Exact calculations of single- and/or double-photon bremsstrahlung corrections for several subprocesses which contribute to these backgrounds would be complicated, but not impossible. However, the complete analysis of the \(\gamma\gamma\) and \(\gamma\gamma\ell\) backgrounds requires simultaneous control of photons radiated from the different sources in the same event. This can be done only with complete Monte Carlo, i.e. a generator which includes also a QCD shower, multiple interactions, formation and decay of a hadronic cascade, etc.

In [3] we have proposed the following strategy for including QED backgrounds in the physics simulation with well _controlled_ precision:

* The simulation of the \(\gamma\gamma\) background is performed with an approximate Monte Carlo, which can implement QED bremsstrahlung for any subprocess and can be combined with any physics generator not including QED effects.
* The precision of this approximate approach is verified for each particular subprocess by comparison with an exact calculation embodied in the form of a dedicated Monte Carlo.
* Only if the required precision for a particular subprocess becomes very high is the approximate simulation for this subprocess replaced by the exact one in the full physics Monte Carlo.

This strategy has the following advantages. It is based on the existing Monte Carlo generator which gives complete event simulation and is implemented into the software environment of experimental analysis. The approximate but universal treatment of QED corrections reduces significantly (by a factor of 10 or even more ) both CPU time and a number of an additional lines of code without compromising precision of predictions below acceptable limits (at the time being \(\sim 20\%\) for LHC ).

As a utility Monte Carlo for generation of QED radiative corrections in particle decays we use PHOTOS package[4] which can be combined with a basic1 physics Monte Carlo like JETSET [5], PYTHIA [5], KORALZ [6]. This approach, called later the "hybrid" solution has been tested [8, 4] in several decay channels. In [3] we discussed the accuracy of this scheme in the case of \(pp\to t\bar{t}\gamma\) and \(pp\to t\bar{t}\gamma\gamma\) processes. In the present paper we again follow this strategy for simulation of QED bremsstrahlung in the \(Z^{0}\to\ell^{+}\ell^{-}\) channel. We control the correctness/precision of "hybrid" solution by comparing results with those given by exact matrix elements calculations. To this end the exact matrix element Monte Carlo TOPKI, described in [3], is now updated with a new process, namely \({\cal O}(\alpha^{0})\), \({\cal O}(\alpha^{1})\) and \({\cal O}(\alpha^{2})\)_real_ QED bremsstrahlung corrections to the process \(pp\to Z^{0}/\gamma^{*}\to\ell^{+}\ell^{-}\).

Footnote 1: As “basic” Monte Carlo in the “hybrid” solution, we understand the Monte Carlo generator which generates the required process without final state QED corrections.

We discuss the \(pp\to Z^{0}/\gamma^{*}\to\ell^{+}\ell^{-}\) process as a possible source of background to direct and associated Higgs production. In the case of direct Higgs production, the dominant background source is the direct photon production process \(pp\to\gamma\gamma\)[2]. However the \(pp\to Z^{0}/\gamma^{*}\to e^{+}e^{-}\) channel, because of its large resonance cross-section and due to possible electron mis-identification as photon, is a dangerous background in the mass range around 90 GeV (\(M_{H}\sim M_{Z^{0}}\)) [9]. In the case of associated Higgs production, a significant contribution2 to the background comes from radiative \(Z^{0}\) production and decay with photon emission from initial quark line and/or a final lepton lines.

Footnote 2: This source of background, partially considered already in [9], has been neglected in the literature before, see e.g. [10].

In the analysis presented below we will not explore all possibilities for the background analysis coming from this "hybrid" solution. As it covers full M.C. event generation incorporating QCD shower, multiple interactions, formation and decay of hadronic cascade, etc., studies of isolation cuts and the proper treatment of detector response would be possible. It would also be possible to include other sources of photons which appear in the full event (e.g. QED bremsstrahlung in decays of hadronic cascades) or are created by the detector (e.g. "external bremsstrahlung"). Such simulation is clearly required in the analysis of the background to Higgs production but is out of the scope of this paper.

This paper is organized as follows. In section 2, we briefly describe QED \({\cal O}(\alpha^{2})\) processes in the \(Z^{0}/\gamma^{*}\to\ell^{+}\ell^{-}\) channel which can be simulated by TOPKI and/or by the "hybrid" solution PYTHIA+ PHOTOS. In section 3, we present results of the background simulation for direct Higgs production (\(\gamma\gamma\) signature) and, in section 4, for associated Higgs production (\(\gamma\gamma\ell\) signature). Conclusions summarize these results in section 5. In Appendices A - D, we collect additional results which present tests on PHOTOS performance and benchmark (control) Tables. The details concerning the implementation of the new process to TOPKI are given in Appendix E.

\({\cal O}(\alpha^{2})\) QED bremsstrahlung in the \(pp\to Z^{0}/\gamma^{*}\to\ell^{+}\ell^{-}\) process: exact matrix element and approximate Monte Carlo generators

A complete perturbative treatment of QED corrections requires calculations, in a given scheme (eg. order by order in \(\alpha/\pi\)), of virtual/soft and hard photon contributions. In the case of the hard process \(q\bar{q}\to Z^{0}/\gamma^{*}\to\ell^{+}\ell^{-}\), it involves photon emission from quarks (initial state) and/or leptons (final state) with the initial\(-\)final interference included. Such rigorous complete exact calculations/Monte Carlo do not exist to the \({\cal O}(\alpha^{2})\) approximation for this channel.

For the background simulation we are not necessarily forced to provide such calculations and some simplifications of the problem can be introduced.

* We are not interested in the calculation of the inclusive cross section to the \({\cal O}(\alpha^{2})\) but in the simulation of \(0,1\), \(2\) real photon (s) configurations in this process. Therefore soft/virtual corrections can be treated only in the leading-log approximation or even completely neglected as the "higher order" corrections to the given configuration.
* We neglect the initial\(-\)final state interference which is however suppressed by the \(Z^{0}\) lifetime and on the \(Z^{0}\) peak [12] gives the contribution below \(10^{-3}\). Therefore, we can consider separately contributions from pure initial state, pure final state or mixed initial\(+\)final state bremsstrahlung in respect to the \(Z^{0}/\gamma^{*}\) production.
* As the required precision is not very high, some approximation on the QED matrix elements are possible.
* We restrict the region of the applicability of the calculations to photons emitted with high transverse momentum in respect to the beam axis (quark lines). Therefore, photon emission from quarks can be treated only perturbatively [13].

Taking into account the possible approximations outlined above, in the following we present two independent approaches for simulation of up to double hard photon configurations in the \(pp\to Z^{0}/\gamma^{*}\to\ell^{+}\ell^{-}\) channel.

### Exact matrix element Monte Carlo TOPKI

The Monte Carlo program, TOPKI, is the _exact_ matrix element generator for simulation of fixed photon multiplicity configurations in respective lowest QED order. Namely: a Born process in \({\cal O}(\alpha^{0})\), single hard photon configurations in \({\cal O}(\alpha^{1})\) and double hard photon configurations in \({\cal O}(\alpha^{2})\). The virtual/soft QED corrections and initial\(-\)final state interference are not included. We consider only the lowest order QCD diagram which in the case of \(Z^{0}/\gamma^{*}\) production, is a quark/antiquark annihilation.

Let us make a list of the hard processes which can be generated in this channel (please note that the multiplicity of photon(s) is always fixed).

* \({\cal O}(\alpha^{0})\) process: \(q\bar{q}\to Z^{0}/\gamma^{*}\to\ell^{+}\ell^{-}\)
* \({\cal O}(\alpha^{1})\) process with single photon radiation in the initial or final state: \(q\bar{q}\to\gamma_{ini}Z^{0}/\gamma^{*}\to\ell^{+}\ell^{-}\gamma_{ini}\) \(q\bar{q}\to Z^{0}/\gamma^{*}\to\ell^{+}\ell^{-}\gamma_{fin}\)
* \({\cal O}(\alpha^{2})\) process with double photon radiation in the pure initial, pure final or mixed initial+final state: \(q\bar{q}\to\gamma_{ini}\gamma_{ini}Z^{0}/\gamma^{*}\to\ell^{+}\ell^{-}\gamma_{ini }\gamma_{ini}\) \(q\bar{q}\to\gamma_{ini}Z^{0}/\gamma^{*}\to\ell^{+}\ell^{-}\gamma_{ini}\gamma_{fin}\) \(q\bar{q}\to Z^{0}/\gamma^{*}\to\ell^{+}\ell^{-}\gamma_{fin}\gamma_{fin}\)

Only one of the processes listed above can be simulated at a time.

The crucial part of the program is a set of routines calculating these exact matrix elements. We use our own code based on the spinor product formalism developed by the CALCUL collaboration [11]. The technical details concerning this code are described in Appendix E and in our previous paper [3]. In contrast to the other realization of the CALCUL method, this method does not require any algebraic manipulation.

The second important part of this program is a set of phase-space generators for 2, 3, 4 final-state particles with presampling required for the respective configurations (infra-red singularity, collinear singularity, \(Z^{0}\) resonance, etc.). The implemented exact matrix element formulae treat leptons as massive particles and quarks as massless ones. This resolves the problem of collinear singularities in the case of final state bremsstrahlung (emission from leptons) which are regularized by a lepton mass. The emission of photons from quarks is treated only perturbatively and the collinear region is removed from the generated phase-space by requiring photon transverse momenta (with respect to the beam axis i.e. the quark-antiquark axis) to be greater than a certain value, \(p_{T}^{\gamma}>p_{T_{min}}\), in the proton-proton rest frame. The infra-red singularities are regularized by an infra-red cut-off on the photon energy in the quark-antiquark rest frame which is well below the region interesting for simulation. We keep the generation of the phase-space separated from the generation of the energy of interacting partons which leads to a clear and modular structure of the algorithm.

### Approximate "hybrid" solution: PYTHIA + PHOTOS

The "hybrid" solution consists of the basic physics Monte Carlo generator not including QED corrections in decays, in combination with the "approximate" QED generator PHOTOS. As regards hard processes, the initial state bremsstrahlung should be generated by a basic Monte Carlo while final state bremsstrahlung is generated by PHOTOS.

The Monte Carlo package PHOTOS implements an algorithm of QED single-photon and double-photon radiative corrections in decays. This program is universal, i.e. it generates, according to a certain approximation, QED bremsstrahlung in the decay of "any" resonance. It is based on the leading-log approximation for the bremsstrahlung matrix element, but conserves also a proper soft-photon behaviour and includes interference effects in a single decay branch. It provides the four momenta of particles in the final state, including mass effects. The package PHOTOS can be executed to \({\cal O}(\alpha^{1})\) QED corrections (option ISEC=.FALSE.) or to \({\cal O}(\alpha^{2})\) QED corrections (option ISEC=.TRUE. ). The photon multiplicity is not fixed in the simulation by PHOTOS, which to given \({\cal O}(\alpha^{n})\); \(n=0,1,2\) generates a mixture of configurations up to \(n\) photons.

Let us specify the list of hard processes in this channel which can be simulated by the "hybrid" solution using as a basic event generator PYTHIA 5.7 [7] in combination with the approximate QED generator PHOTOS 2.0 [4].

* \({\cal O}(\alpha^{0})\) process: PYTHIA ( ISUB=1) \(\longrightarrow\)\(q\overline{q}\to Z^{0}/\gamma^{*}\to\ell^{+}\ell^{-}\)
* \({\cal O}(\alpha^{1})\) processes: PYTHIA (ISUB=19) \(\longrightarrow\)\(q\overline{q}\to\gamma_{ini}Z^{0}/\gamma^{*}\to\ell^{+}\ell^{-}\gamma_{ini}\) PYTHIA (ISUB=1) + PHOTOS (ISEC=.FALSE. ) \(\longrightarrow\)\(q\overline{q}\to Z^{0}/\gamma^{*}\to\ell^{+}\ell^{-}(\gamma_{fin})\)
* \({\cal O}(\alpha^{2})\) processes: PYTHIA ( ISUB=19) + PHOTOS (ISEC=.FALSE. ) \(\longrightarrow\)\(q\overline{q}\to\gamma_{ini}Z^{0}/\gamma^{*}\to\ell^{+}\ell^{-}\gamma_{ini}(\gamma_{fin})\) PYTHIA (ISUB=1) + PHOTOS (ISEC=.TRUE. ) \(\longrightarrow\)\(q\overline{q}\to Z^{0}/\gamma^{*}\to\ell^{+}\ell^{-}(\gamma_{fin})(\gamma_{fin})\)

The brackets \((\gamma_{fin})\) denote that the final state photon multiplicity is not fixed.

The PYTHIA generator can be replaced in the above specification by any equivalent Monte Carlo generator. In particular it can be replaced by the respective \({\cal O}(\alpha^{0})\), \({\cal O}(\alpha^{1})\) options of TOPKI, if full event creation (QCD shower, multiple interactions, hadronization, etc.) can be omitted in the simulation3.

Footnote 3: In fact we do this replacement later. The respective options of the generator TOPKI are compatible with the PYTHIA 5.7 generator: channel ISUB=1 for the case of the \(pp\to Z^{0}/\gamma^{*}\to\ell^{+}\ell^{-}\) process (see Table C) and channel ISUB=19 for the case of the \(pp\to\gamma_{ini}\,Z^{0}/\gamma^{*}\to\ell^{+}\ell^{-}\gamma_{ini}\) process (see Table D).

The results obtained from the exact matrix element generator TOPKI and from the "hybrid" solution PYTHIA + PHOTOS (TOPKI + PHOTOS) have been compared to verify the performance of PHOTOS and cross-check these two independent approaches. In all cases we get an agreement usually better than 10% on the distributions and on the total cross-sections. The benchmark Tables and a few Figures from these comparisons are collected in Appendices C and D. However, the comparison with TOPKI tests only lowest-order configurations with fixed photon multiplicity, i.e. single photon configurations in \({\cal O}(\alpha^{1})\) and double photon configurations in \({\cal O}(\alpha^{2})\). PHOTOS simulates, in the leading-log approximation, also virtual/soft contributions to \({\cal O}(\alpha^{1})\) and \({\cal O}(\alpha^{2})\). These have been checked with semi-analytical leading-log formulae and the comparison is presented in Appendix A.

Let us stress that when choosing between \({\cal O}(\alpha^{1})\) or \({\cal O}(\alpha^{2})\) approximations in PHOTOS, one should remember that the physical results are given only by the so-called _infrared-safe_ observables. For example the single photon spectrum for \(E_{\gamma}>E_{min}\) is such an observable in the \({\cal O}(\alpha^{1})\) approximation and it is not in the \({\cal O}(\alpha^{2})\) approximation where this spectrum depends on the infra-red cut-off applied for the second photon4. In the \({\cal O}(\alpha^{2})\) approximation such an observable is the \(M^{\gamma\gamma}\) spectrum.

Footnote 4: The similar effect occurs in the analysis of isolated photon production in the \(Z^{0}\) hadronic decays: \(Z\to q\bar{q}\gamma\), \(Z\to q\bar{q}g\gamma\), where theoretical predictions are sensitive to the partonic isolation cut-off [16].

## 3 Background to direct Higgs production

In this section we discuss the \(pp\to Z^{0}/\gamma^{*}\to\ell^{+}\ell^{-}\) channel with \({\cal O}(\alpha^{2})\) QED corrections as a source of background5 for the direct Higgs (\(H\to\gamma\gamma\)) signal.

Footnote 5: For the background simulation, we use the default version of PYTHIA 5.6 structure function parametrization, i.e. the EHLQ set 1 [15] (updated version 1986). To avoid confusion we use \(\alpha_{QED}=1/137\) for QED bremsstrahlung.

Let us recall that in [14] the following cuts were proposed for the \(\gamma\gamma\) background analysis: \(p_{T}^{\gamma_{1}}>\)25 GeV, \(p_{T}^{\gamma_{2}}>\)40 GeV, \(|\eta^{\gamma_{1},\gamma_{2}}|<2.5\) and \(p_{T}^{\gamma_{2}}/(p_{T}^{\gamma_{1}}+p_{T}^{\gamma_{2}})<0.7\) where the transverse momentum \(p_{T}\) is measured with respect to the beam axis.

We start with the discussion of mass distributions of every photon/electron configuration which may contribute to this background. We consider separately the \({\cal O}(\alpha^{2})\) pure initial state, pure final state and mixed initial-final state bremsstrahlung.

Figures 1 and 2 show the mass distributions \(d\sigma/dM\) for \(ee,\gamma e\) and \(\gamma\gamma\) pairs passing the above cuts. In Fig. 1 the distributions are shown for the process \(pp\to Z^{0}/\gamma^{*}\to\ell^{+}\ell^{-}(\gamma_{fin})(\gamma_{fin})\) and in Fig. 2 for the process \(pp\to\gamma_{ini}Z^{0}/\gamma^{*}\to\ell^{+}\ell^{-}\gamma_{ini}(\gamma_{fin})\). The \(M^{ee}\) distribution6 is strongly peaked around the \(Z^{0}\) mass. As expected, the \(M^{\gamma e}\) and \(M^{\gamma\gamma}\) distributions are monotonically decreasing in the region of interest, i.e. \(80GeV<M<130\) GeV (no peak from the \(Z^{0}\) resonance is visible). Above the \(Z^{0}\) peak the \(M^{\gamma e}\) and \(M^{\gamma\gamma}\) contributions from the process with mixed initial+final state bremsstrahlung are slightly bigger than that from the process with pure final-state bremsstrahlung because, in the first case, the effect of the \(Z^{0}\) resonance is smeared over a large region of \(M\). The pure initial-state bremsstrahlung gives a contribution to the background at the level of \(10^{-2}\) of the contributions from other configurations and can be neglected in the analysis.

Footnote 6: The \(M^{ee}\) peak is reduced by \(\sim 13\%\) due to the final state bremsstrahlung. The respective Figure is presented in Appendix B.

However, to check whether this channel contributes significantly to the total direct Higgs background, one has to compare these results with the background from the dominant direct photon channel \(pp\to\gamma\gamma\). In Fig. 3 this comparison is shown. We assumed photon identification efficiency of 80% and a 2% probability that the electron would be mis-identified as a photon \(\hat{\gamma}\) (efficiency for vetoing electron 98%). As pointed out already in [9], the contribution from \(\hat{\gamma}\hat{\gamma}\) pairs from mis-identified \(Z^{0}\to e^{+}e^{-}\) decays creates a very dangerous peak in the background if the efficiency for vetoing the electron is not high enough. This peak should be compared to the \(H\to\gamma\gamma\) signal peak and not to the \(pp\to\gamma\gamma\) background, and in fact, an efficiency of the order of 99.8% is needed to reduce it sufficiently below the standard model \(H\to\gamma\gamma\) signal [9]. The non-resonant \(\gamma\hat{\gamma}\) and \(\gamma\gamma\) contributions are completely overshadowed by the contribution from the direct photon channel \(pp\to\gamma\gamma\), even for moderate efficiency for vetoing the electron. Let us stress, however, that we perform only the "particle level" simulation where particles are kinematically separated. The \(\gamma\hat{\gamma}\) and \(\gamma\gamma\) distributions may become "resonant" if the remaining electrons, instead of being lost or identified, deposit their energy in the observed photonic cluster(s). The simulation of these effects requires detailed study of the detector performance and is beyond the scope of this paper.

Figure 1: The distributions: \(d\sigma/dM^{\gamma}\), \(d\sigma/dM^{\gamma e}\), \(d\sigma/dM^{ee}\) in the process pp \(\to\)\(Z^{0}/\gamma^{*}\to\ell^{+}\ell^{-}(\gamma_{fin})(\gamma_{fin})\). The results are obtained from PHOTOS applied to the \({\cal O}(\alpha^{0})\) option of TOPKI. The pairs \(\gamma\gamma\), \(\gamma e\), ee are counted if they fulfil the following conditions: p\({}_{T}^{1}\) >25 GeV, p\({}_{T}^{2}\) >40 GeV, \(|\eta^{1,2}|<2.5\) and p\({}_{T}^{2}/(p_{T}^{1}+p_{T}^{2})<0.7\) (proposed for the background analysis in [14]). The thick and thin lines represent the \(d\sigma/dM^{\gamma\gamma}\) distribution, the full circle \(d\sigma/dM^{\gamma e}\) and the open circle d\(\sigma/dM^{ee}\). The proton-proton rest frame energy is \(\sqrt{s}=16\) TeV.

Figure 2: The distributions: \(d\sigma/dM^{\gamma\gamma}\), \(d\sigma/dM^{\gamma e}\) in the process \(pp\to\gamma_{ini}\ Z^{0}/\gamma^{*}\to\ell^{+}\ell^{-}\gamma_{ini}(\gamma_{fin})\). The results are obtained from PHOTOS applied to the \({\cal O}(\alpha^{1})\) option of TOPKI with initial state bremsstrahlung only. The pairs \(\gamma\gamma\) and \(\gamma e\) are counted if they fulfil the following conditions: \(p_{T}^{1}>\)25 GeV, \(p_{T}^{2}>\)40 GeV, \(|\eta^{1,2}|<2.5\) and \(p_{T}^{2}/(p_{T}^{1}+p_{T}^{2})<0.7\) (proposed for the background analysis in [14]). The thick and thin lines represent the \(d\sigma/dM^{\gamma\gamma}\) distribution and the full circle \(d\sigma/dM^{\gamma e}\). The proton-proton rest frame energy is \(\sqrt{s}=16\) TeV.

Figure 3: The distributions: \(d\sigma/dM^{\gamma\gamma}\), \(d\sigma/dM^{\gamma\hat{\gamma}}\), \(d\sigma/dM^{\hat{\gamma}\hat{\gamma}}\) in the process pp \(\to Z^{0}/\gamma^{*}\to\ell^{+}\ell^{-}(\gamma)(\gamma)\) (all configurations included). The results are obtained from PHOTOS applied to TOPKI. The pairs \(\gamma\gamma\), \(\gamma\hat{\gamma}\), \(\hat{\gamma}\hat{\gamma}\), where \(\hat{\gamma}\) denotes an electron mis-identified as a photon, are counted as background pairs if they fulfil the following conditions: \(p_{T}^{1}>\)25 GeV, \(p_{T}^{2}>\)40 GeV, \(|\eta^{1,2}|<2.5\) and \(p_{T}^{2}/(p_{T}^{1}+p_{T}^{2})<0.7\) (proposed for the background analysis in [14]). Efficiencies, of 98% for electron veto and of 80% for photon identification were assumed. The thick line represents the \(d\sigma/dM^{\gamma\gamma}\) distribution, the full circles \(d\sigma/dM^{\gamma\hat{\gamma}}\) and the open circles \(d\sigma/dM^{\hat{\gamma}\hat{\gamma}}\). The thin line represents the \(d\sigma/dM^{\gamma\gamma}\) distribution from direct photon pair production simulated by PYTHIA (ISUB=18 and ISUB=114, QCD shower switched off, not corrected for QCD K-factors). The proton-proton rest frame energy is \(\sqrt{\hat{s}}=16\) TeV.

Background to associated Higgs production

In this section we discuss the \(pp\to Z^{0}/\gamma^{*}\to\ell^{+}\ell^{-}\) channel with \({\cal O}(\alpha^{2})\) QED corrections as a significant source of background7 to associated Higgs production.

Footnote 7: For the background simulation we use the default version of PYTHIA 5.6 structure function parametrization i.e. the EHLQ set 1[15] (updated version 1986). Therefore the backward compatibility with results for the \(t\bar{t}\) channel [3] is kept. To avoid confusion we use \(\alpha_{QED}=1/137\) for QED bremsstrahlung.

We use the following cuts8 to select the \(\gamma\gamma\ell\) event: \(p_{T}^{\gamma_{1},\ell}>\)25 GeV, \(p_{T}^{\gamma_{2}}>\)40 GeV, \(|\eta^{\gamma,\ell}|<2.5\). In addition, as proposed in [9], we require \(M^{\gamma\ell}>25GeV\) and \(|M^{\gamma\ell}-M_{Z^{0}}|>10\) GeV for each lepton-photon combination9.

Footnote 8: They are similar but not totally compatible with those proposed in [9].

Footnote 9: Let us stress that here this cut is not as strong as in [9]. We have applied the \(M^{\gamma\ell}\) cut to the second lepton if its \(p_{T}>25\) GeV (instead of 10 GeV). Therefore the rejection power of this cut is not as high.

We start with the discussion of real two-photon configurations. As in the previous chapter, we consider separately pure initial, pure final and mixed initial-final state bremsstrahlung. In Table 1 we collect results for cross-sections in the mass range 70 GeV \(<M^{\gamma\gamma}<140\) GeV. The dominant contribution comes from the mixed initial-final bremsstrahlung configuration with the \(\gamma_{ini}\gamma_{fin}\mu\) contribution being at the level of 50% of the \(\gamma_{ini}\gamma_{fin}e\) contribution10. The Figures 4a - 4d show respective \(M^{\gamma\gamma}\) and \(M^{\gamma\ell}\) distributions (without the \(M^{\gamma\ell}\) cut included). The contribution from \(\gamma_{ini}\gamma_{fin}\ell\) and from \(\gamma_{fin}\gamma_{fin}\ell\) are comparable. The cut on \(M^{\gamma\ell}_{min}\) is particularly efficient in reducing the background from \(\gamma_{fin}\gamma_{fin}\ell\) configurations, see Table 1. After applying cuts on the \(M^{\gamma\ell}\) and adding the contributions from both these configurations together, we get the real two-photon background from the \(Z^{0}/\gamma^{*}\to\ell^{+}\ell^{-}\) channel, Fig. 4e, comparable with that from the \(t\bar{t}\) channel (see Fig. 5c in [3]). The background from the \(\gamma_{fin}\gamma_{fin}\ell\) events is strongly reduced to the level of 20% of the contribution from the \(\gamma_{ini}\gamma_{fin}\ell\) configuration. The contribution from the pure initial-state bremsstrahlung is at the level of \(10^{-2}\) of the contribution from other configurations and can therefore be neglected in the analysis.

Footnote 10: Later, we omit \(\gamma\gamma\tau\) events as nearly completely eliminated due to \(\tau\) decay.

We have also simulated events which may contribute to the background due to the electron mis-identification as a photon, namely the \(\gamma\gamma e\) events where one photon is faked by the electron. The respective cross-sections are given in Table 2. Figure 4f shows the \(M^{\gamma e}\) and \(M^{\gamma e}\) distributions for events which passed \(p_{T}\) and \(\eta\) cuts, as defined above. We assumed the photon identification efficiency to be of 80% and of a 2% probability that the electron would be mis-identified as a photon. With this assumption, the background from the \(\gamma\gamma e\) events is at the level of 50% of the \(\gamma\gamma\ell\) background (see Fig. 4g).

One should, however, be aware that cuts on \(M^{\gamma\ell}\), if applied differently, can change this proportion and reduce the bremsstrahlung background even more strongly. Also, the relative magnitude of the background from the \(t\bar{t}\) channel and \(Z^{0}/\gamma^{*}\) channel may depend to some extent on the choice of structure functions and the energy scale \(Q^{2}\).

In this paper we have discussed the \({\cal O}(\alpha^{2})\) QED corrections in the \(pp\to Z^{0}/\gamma^{*}\to\ell^{+}\ell^{-}\) process. Two approaches have been presented. The first one is the updated Monte Carlo generator TOPKI with an implemented exact matrix element for this process. The second one is the approximate generator, called the "hybrid" solution i.e., event Monte Carlo not including QED corrections in combination with the PHOTOS package to generate final state QED bremsstrahlung. We compared results from these two approaches to verify the correctness/precision of the performance of PHOTOS for this channel. The PHOTOS generator covers also virtual/soft photon corrections in the leading-log approximation and these terms were tested by comparison with semi-analytical formulae.

We have shown with our simulation that the \(Z^{0}/\gamma^{*}\to\ell^{+}\ell^{-}\) channel contributes a significant background to \(H\to\gamma\gamma\) only for events with both electrons mis-identified as photons which results in a \(M^{\hat{\gamma}\hat{\gamma}}\) distribution peaked around the \(Z^{0}\) mass. This requires very high electron veto efficiency to bring this background peak well below signal peak. The contributions from events with at least one real photon i.e., \(\gamma\gamma\) or \(\gamma\hat{\gamma}\) events, are "non-resonant" and overwhelmed by the direct photon background. But we also point out that the "resonant" shape of mass distribution of \(\gamma\gamma\) or \(\gamma\hat{\gamma}\) events may be created due to detector performance. This requires detailed detector simulation which is not discussed here.

We have studied the background to associated Higgs production coming from this channel. We have found that events with the pure initial state bremsstrahlung do not contribute significantly to the background. The dominant contributions come from the mixed initial+final state configurations (pure final- state configurations contribute on the level of 20%). We have found that for associated Higgs production the background from the \(Z^{0}/\gamma^{*}\to\ell^{+}\ell^{-}\) channel is at the level of the dominant background from the \(t\bar{t}\) channel. We have also considered events with one electron being mis-identified as a photon. We have found that for photon identification efficiency of 80% and of 98% efficiency for vetoing the electron they would contribute at the level of \(\sim 50\%\) of the real photon background from this channel.
