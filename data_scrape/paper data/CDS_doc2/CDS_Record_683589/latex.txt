We report on several measurements performed on the new scintillating tiles produced for the Extended Barrel Modules 0. We measured the light yield, the response uniformity, the attenuation length and the tiles thickness. The results are compared with those obtained with the old tiles used to equip the Barrel Module 0 in 1996. The performance of the new Tyvek sleeves were also examined.

Introduction

The equipment of the two extended Barrel Modules 0 with a new set of tiles has been completed recently. The new tiles, as the ones used for the Barrel Module 0 in 1996, were make by IHEP at Protvino. A sample of these new production scintillators, already wrapped with Tyvek, arrived at CERN. The Tyvek sleeves were produce by the Irigro Company, in Ontario, and were also black-painted on the side where the Mylar had to be applied, in order to smooth the light yield near the edges.

At CERN, on the two lateral sides where the fibres have to be connected, a small piece of aluminized Mylar was put (fixed with adhesive tape in the two sides) to keep the fibres in place.

In addition, we tested a rectangular tile produced by Bicron using the injection molding technique. The tile is made of PolyVinylToluene (PVT). The claim is that the use of PVT as base plastic should lead to an intrinsic light yield 15-20% higher than the one obtained with tiles made of polystyrene (which is used for the tiles produced in Protvino). Table 1 lists the geometrical dimension of the tiles.

## 2 Experimental Setup

The measurements were done using the setup shown in Figure 1. To excite the scintillating material of the tiles we used a \({}^{90}\)Sr \(\beta\) source (the black point

The dimensions of the injection molded Bicron tile are also shown._in Figure 1). Green WLS Y11 fibres of Kuraray, about 1 meter long with a diameter of 1 mm, and with one end mirrored, were inserted at the two sides of the tile, into the Mylar guides. The non-mirrored end was sent to a photomultiplier (PM). The PM cathodic current was then sent to a multimeter which measured the light yield in mV. All the system was light tight.

## 3 Effect of Tyvek on light yield

Differently to the last year only the internal side of the tile envelopes were blackned, in the previous production the envelopes were dippened in the black paint so both sides were masked.

To give an idea of the different masking areas, we measured the small and large sides (side \(a\) and side \(b\) as shown in Figure 2) for one envelope of each

size of the old and new production. The results (in mm) are summarized in table 2.

As a first step the performance of the new Tyvek envelopes was

measured. Tiles of the new production were excited with the source located in their centre. One tile for each size was first wrapped in the old sleeves and after in one of the new sleeves. The results are shown in Figure 3. It seems that in general for the old Tyvek a higher light yield was obtained. Differences are within 10%-15%. This result can be due to the masking, since the old small sleeves (from #1 to #5) were unmasked, and for the large sleeves (from #6 to #11) the new masking area is larger than the old one. Moreover the new masking looks darker than the old one.

## 4 Light Yield

The light yield was measured by exciting the tiles with the source in their centre. The results (average the measurements of 2-3 tiles at each size) are shown in Figure 4, where the light yield vs the ratio of the the width over the tile area is shown 1.

Footnote 1: We remind that this parametrisation, in the case of trapezoidal tile is equal to the half-sum of the trapezoidal bases

The results are compared with those relative to the 1996 production tiles, and show that the 1997 light yield is larger (despite of what previously seen for the new Tyvek envelopes). This can be a consequence of the increased tile thickness (see Section 5). In addition, the linear dependence on \(w/A\)

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|} \hline Tile nr. & Mod 0 max & Mod 0 min & EB Mod 0 max & EB Mod 0 min \\  & (mm) & (mm) & (mm) & (mm) \\ \hline \hline
1 & - & - & 10 & 6 \\

The tiles we measured were chosen randomly from a batch of tiles, left over from the Extended Barrel Modules 0 assembly, Figure 4 shows also the light yield for the Bicron tile 2, which is lower than that obtained with our tiles.

Footnote 2: The Bicron tile was inserted in one of the new envelope.

## 5 Thickness

After removing the envelopes, the old and new tiles thickness was measured in 8 different points according to the scheme shown in Figure 5. The points are at a distance of about 2 cm from the tile sides. To perform these measurements we used a micrometer (with an accuracy of 0.01 mm).

Figures 6 and 7 show the thickness in mm for the old and new tiles. For

Figure 3: _Ratio of the light yield for the 11 new tiles wrapped with the old and the new Tyvek envelopes._

each of the 11 sizes 4 different tiles have been measured, and the plot shows the mean value.

The same exercise was repeated for the Bicron tile, which is characterised by a larger thickness (around 4.9 mm) with respect to our st andard tiles. The results are shown in Table 3. In this case the thickness is very uniform over the tile surface. Finally, Figure 8, 9 shows the ratio between new and old thicknesses for the Protvino tiles. From these data the following observations can be made:

* The 1997 tiles are thicker than the 1996 ones;
* This increase in thickness is different for different tile sizes: for the largest tiles (#9, #10 and #11) it is much larger then for the small tiles;
* For all the tiles, the axial region (points P5 and P7) shows the larger increase (\(\simeq 10\%\)); In particular, point P7 (in the injection side) is thicker than the rest of the tile;

Similar measurements have been recently performed in Barcelona [2] (on a larger sample of tiles), and confirm our results.

Figures 10 shows in more detail the profile along the long and short bases of the tile, where measurements have been taken every 2 cm.

## 6 Uniformity and attenuation length

We measured the light yield uniformity in the new tiles and the new Tyvek envelopes. Only one tile for each size was measured. The results are shown in Figure 11 and Figure 12. Table 4 summarizes the rms (%) obtained for the 11 tiles (new production) [3]

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|} \hline Point & Thickness(mm) \\ \hline P1 & 4.87 \\ P2 & 4.87 \\ P3 & 4.91 \\ P4 & 4.91 \\ P5 & 4.87 \\ P6 & 4.85 \\ P7 & 4.89 \\ P8 & 4.86 \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 3: _Thickness for the Bicron tile, measured in the 8 points._

Figure 5: _Scheme of the 8 different points were the tiles thickness was measured._

We also measured the Bicron tile which looks rather uniform (the rms is around 1.6%). For this tile the attenuation length was also measured (see Figure 13, lower plot). To make this measure, we read the tile with only one fibres, while blackening the other side. If the result is fitted with an exponential function, a value for the attenuation length equal to about 23 cm is obtained, compatible with the value measured for our tiles [3][4]. We have repeated this exercise for the 1996 production tiles, in Figure 14 are reported the results for the smallest and the largest tiles.

## 7 Conclusions

The new tiles perform better than those of the previous (1996) production in terms of light yield, at least for the biggest tiles. A factor contributing to this improvement can be the larger thickness. For what concern the Tyvek sleeves, the measurements have been performed only on one set of 11 new and old envelopes, but the results indicate that the new sleeves worsen the light yield with respect to the old ones (most probably due to the new masking). The tiles uniformity is in the range 1.3-2.6%. From the geometrical point of view, the 1997 tiles present a rather pronounced non-uniformity in their thickness. This problem is particularly evident for the larger size tiles and caused some troubles during the tile insertion in the Extended Barrel Module0's 4.

Footnote 4: Note that the values reported here are higher than those presented by G. Grandes at the Tile general meeting, during the May 97 Atlas Week.

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|} \hline Tile & rms (\%) \\ \hline
1 & 1.9 \\
2 & 1.7 \\
3 & 1.3 \\
4 & 1.9 \\
5 & 2.0 \\
6 & 2.2 \\
7 & 2.6 \\
8 & 1.8 \\
9 & 2.5 \\
10 & 2.5 \\
11 & 2.6 \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 4: _Rms from the uniformity study of the 11 tile sizes (new production)._We also tested the performance of a Bicron tile produced by injection molding and using a different base. The light yield seems to be worse than that of the Protvino tiles, and the measured attenuation length is about 20 cm. For the light response and geometry, the Bicron tile is more uniform than ours.
