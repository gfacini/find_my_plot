**Distribution**Preliminary Design Review of the ATLAS magnets

_18 - 20 June 1996_

_Executive Summary_

The objective of this review was to obtain the opinion of outside experts as to

1) The feasibility of the magnets

2) Areas of potential risk

3) Interactions or conflicts between the magnet systems

4) Proposals for R&D

5) Recommendations, in particular with respect to possible sharing of work.

The members of the Review Committee are listed in Appendix I, and a full description of its mandate is given in Appendix II.

The Committee was impressed by the quantity and quality of work done by the teams since the EDR, and appreciated the clarity of the presentations by numerous speakers.

While these magnets should be technically feasible, the committee feels that potential risk could be reduced by

* a small increase in the thickness of the solenoid
* improved understanding of the containment of coil in casing for the barrel toroid
* more detailed mechanical calculations for the new structure of the barrel toroid
* a deeper appreciation of the changing sequence of forces and deflections occurring during assembly of both the barrel and end cap toroids
* establishment of criteria to test and accept the co-extruded conductor defining the quality of the bond between aluminium and cable, based on the understanding of the influence of this on strand movement and its influence on stability.

While the basic technology of the axial force transfer between the toroids now seems to be understood, the effect of coil position tolerances on these forces requires attention.

Besides the design, construction and testing of the B\({}_{0}\) coil, which is considered to be vital to the project, R&D must be continued on a number of engineering issues. The teams are encouraged to continue to place contracts with industry for these studies.

The Committee was impressed by how the technical recommendations of the EDR had been taken into consideration, particularly that regarding warm voussoirs in the Barrel.

In conclusion, the three magnetic systems are now closer to an engineering design than to a conceptual design, and henceforth industry should participate in their optimization.

The impressions and concerns of the Committee are expanded in the following pages.

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:3]

_Barrel toroid (BT)_

_Magnetic analysis -_ The analysis is based on the Biot-Savart law, with the effects of iron superimposed via a finite element code with a large mesh, included as a correction to the first analysis. The committee was not fully convinced that this is sufficient. Furthermore the magnetic computations in the presence of iron relate to an ideal geometry and no account is taken of the effect of coil offset, iron B-H curve, etc. These problems should be addressed when presenting the Technical Design Report (TDR).

_Conductor_ - The committee approves the basic parameters of the conductor. Most of our comments on the conductors for the toroids are common to both the BT and the End-Cap Toroid (ECT) and are grouped in a section below.

_Cold Mass_ - Though it would seem to be clear that it is necessary to apply some pre-stress to reduce the shear stress at the bonding of coil to casing, in order to avoid coil movements, there are several concerns about the chosen method based on the use of copper bladders filled with epoxy resin. The thermal contraction from room temperature to 4.5 K does not match that of aluminium, for example, and consequent loss of pre-stress may introduce a source of disturbances. Although the shape of the coil casing is different the team is advised to compare the design with one based on the example of the ECT, and in any case to make tests. The technical and cost arguments leading to the choice of the single, electron-beam welded, I-beam were not clear to the committee. If the choice is maintained, tests of EB welding of 100 mm thick Al alloy are important. Some worry was expressed concerning the temperature distribution inside the coil: it is advised to make FE calculations to verify that the cooling is adequate in the new BT structure. Particular attention should be paid to the region of the coil support elements.

_Cryostat_ - A complete FE stress analysis of the ensemble of vacuum vessel and supporting system should be performed. The maximum allowed acceleration should be better defined, the value of 3g (as specified by CERN) appearing to be rather high. The problem of how to test the cold-to-warm supports must also be addressed.

_Electrical circuit_ - The possible ageing of critical materials does not appear to have been addressed. This may be particularly relevant for the quench heaters, the reliability of which is paramount. Some members of the Committee would have liked to see a set of criteria (e.g. a 15-year equivalent lifetime) clearly defined, and accelerated ageing tests performed. Given the importance of heater reliability, connections to these should be made accessible whenever possible. The impact of fault situations, such as a fast dump and a simultaneous heater failure, on the temperature gradients and stresses within the coil should be submitted to a "what if?" analysis and documented.

The quench analysis (taking into account quench propagation, as the peak voltages during the propagation of a quench can be higher than those computed for the quenching coils only) should have been presented in more detail. We would have likedmanufacture, and testing, of the toroids were direct contributions to the Collaboration from the respective countries. As concerns the major cost, that of manufacture, an agreed method of awarding the contracts, will have to be ensured by passing through the CERN system or proceeding according to officially agreed rules. It would of course be even better if, as in the case of the solenoid, the complete magnets could be considered a contribution. The Collaboration will have to provide a stable expert follow-up for each magnet and ensure necessary coherence in the project management.

_Conclusion_

The project teams are to be congratulated on the fine work they have presented.

In addition to the prototyping exercise represented by the B\({}_{0}\) coil, the ongoing R&D and preparation for production should be continued, in particular as regards

(a) the quality control of the conductor and the influence and control of voids;

unit lengths of conductor should be procured

(b) the role and quality control of impregnation;

classical engineering issues should be addressed to manufacturers

(c) the qualification of the cold-to-warm supports

(d) the development of heaters and safety interlock equipment

(e) the temperature distribution in the coil assemblies

(f) the preparation of a quality assurance plan and various test programmes.

The racetrack coil programme has to be finished and properly documented.

For a large project such as this, a document summarizing the design criteria should be elaborated and made available, in order to ensure equality of safety margins for the various physical/mechanical characteristics issuing from the calculations.

In view of the complexity of the toroids, sufficient contingency should be included in cost estimates, and the planning must be strictly followed to ensure timely installation.

On a different note, given the complication and cost of this four component magnetic spectrometer, and in view of the fact that the field has had to be reduced, some members of the committee would have been appreciated a brief comparison of the physics potential of the present arrangement with that of a conceptually simpler large solenoid with field-shaping poles. Should it become necessary to de-scope the experiment further, from the viewpoint of magnet builders it might make sense to reconsider the magnetic layout in this sense, with regard to cost and risk reduction.

## Appendix II

Mandate to the Review Committee

The Review Committee consists of:

1. Eight experts from outside Atlas, out of which three are from CERN;

2. The Project Engineers of the BT, ECT, and Solenoid, as appropriate;

3. Physicists & engineers members of the Atlas Collaboration.

This committee reports to the Toroid Steering Group and to the Executive

Board of the Atlas Collaboration. The mandate of the Review Committee is to:

1. Evaluate the technical feasibility of the proposed solutions;

2. Identify the areas where substantial technical and/or financial risk may still exist;

3. Evaluate the proposed design from the viewpoints of

* what constraints the magnet design may still impose on the design of the rest of the Atlas detector, and vice-versa ;
* identifying potential conflicts between, on the one hand, the proposed magnet design, and, on the other hand, other Atlas detector subsystems (in areas such as physics performance, layout, installation access, and safety).

4. Comment on the proposed programs of engineering design and of R&D; identify areas, if any, where the Committee would recommend, on the time scale of the 1997 Technical Design Report, either more effort, or a shift in priorities

(in other words : " where are we poorly prepared? what should we focus on?").

5. Comment on the implementation, by design teams, of the recommendations of

the Early Design Review.

6. Evaluate and formulate recommendations on, the proposed sharing of work

between laboratories, as well as on the industrialization plans (i.e. "give

advice on how far to go on outsourcing").
