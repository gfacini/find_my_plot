The discovery potential for the Standard Model Higgs boson through the \(H\to\gamma\gamma\) decay in the ATLAS detector is reported. Various performance aspects of the Higgs boson mass reconstruction and the photon identification are discussed. Trigger issues are also considered. The potential of an inclusive \(H\to\gamma\gamma\) search and Higgs boson searches in association with one or two high \(p_{T}\) jets are evaluated. Studies of the associated \(WH\), \(ZH\) and \(t\bar{t}H\) production processes are also presented. Finally, the discovery potential is assessed using an unbinned multivariate maximum-likelihood fit. These studies are performed for experimental conditions expected for an instantaneous luminosity of \(\approx 10^{33}\,\mathrm{cm}^{-2}\mathrm{s}^{-1}\).

Introduction

In the mass range \(110<m_{H}<140\) GeV the Higgs boson is expected to decay into two photons with a branching fraction large enough to render the search feasible at the LHC [1]. The inclusive search for the Higgs boson in the diphoton decay channel has been studied in ATLAS for many years and constitutes one of the benchmarks for the detector performance [2, 3, 4]. In this paper the sensitivity of ATLAS to this channel is re-evaluated with an updated detector description and software. The impact of higher order QCD and electroweak corrections on the discovery potential is also evaluated.

The Higgs boson can be produced in association with hadronic jets of high transverse momentum, \(p_{T}\). Gluons from initial-state radiation in the \(gg\to H\) and qq\(\rightarrow\)qqH Vector Boson Fusion (VBF) processes are the largest contributors to Higgs boson production in association with high \(p_{T}\) hadronic jets. The search for a Higgs boson using the diphoton decay mode in association with one and two jets at the LHC has been suggested [5, 6, 7] and a previous analysis reported on feasibility studies for these final states using a fast detector simulation [8, 9]. This paper presents an update of these studies based on a more complete description of the detector simulation.

In addition to the diphoton invariant mass, other discriminating variables are incorporated into the analysis and combined by means of an unbinned maximum-likelihood fit. Photon reconstruction properties and the event topology are used to separate the data sample into categories that are fit simultaneously.

In the search for a Standard Model Higgs boson, the associated production with \(W\), \(Z\), or \(t\bar{t}\) can serve to complement the inclusive Higgs boson and Higgs boson + jets channels and help to determine the Higgs boson coupling to the Standard Model gauge bosons and the Yukawa coupling to the top quark [10]. These measurements would provide consistency checks of the Standard Model. They could also be interpreted in terms of Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model couplings at high \(\tan\beta\) (for \(m_{H}\sim 120\) GeV) and high \(m_{A}\). Deviations from Standard Model rates could imply new physics such as gauge-Higgs unification [11, 12] or the presence of resonances in models of little Higgs [13, 14], Left-Right symmetry [15] or technicolour [16]. The feasibility of diphoton searches in association with weak vector bosons is evaluated using a full detector simulation. This involves searches for diphotons in association with either just missing transverse energy, \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\), or \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\) and a charged lepton (electron or muon), and updates earlier studies performed with a fast detector simulation [17, 18].

## 2 Monte Carlo event generation

The Monte Carlo (MC) event generation required for this paper is split into two main groups. The first group corresponds to MC samples produced with a full detector simulation based on GEANT4 [19]. These are used for the evaluation of detailed detector effects relevant to the analyses. The second group of MC samples are processed with a fast detector simulation [20] and are used primarily for the evaluation of the analysis sensitivity. For example, the Higgs boson mass resolution, photon identification efficiency and photon-jet rejection are evaluated with a full detector simulation. The resulting photon efficiency and photon-jet rejection are parameterised as a function of the photon \(p_{T}\) and these parameterisations are then applied to the fast detector simulation.

### Signal processes

Signal events are generated using PYTHIA [21]: this package implements Leading Order (LO) Matrix Element calculations for all the signal processes considered here. The gluon fusion process is also simulated with the MC@NLO [22, 23] package. This package provides QCD Next-to-Leading-Order (NLO) Matrix Elements [24, 25, 26, 27] in addition to a good description of multiple soft-gluon emission at next-to-next-to-leading logarithmic level (NNLL) [28, 29, 30]. This is relevant to evaluating the discriminating power of the diphoton \(p_{T}\) and other relevant variables. All signal processes used here are processed through a full detector simulation. Signal events produced via the VBF mechanism are also modeled with HERWIG [31]. All the generated samples for signal processes used here are normalized to the NLO cross-sections [32] taking into account only QCD corrections.

### Background processes

Background processes can be split into two main groups: backgrounds coming from the production of two isolated photons, which are usually referred to as irreducible, and reducible backgrounds coming from events with at least one fake photon. Fake photons are mostly due to the presence of a leading \(\pi^{0}\) resulting from the fragmentation of a quark or a gluon. Table 1 gives a summary of the MC packages and the cross-sections (in pb) for the irreducible and reducible backgrounds used here.

In this paper QCD corrections to both signal and background are considered in the inclusive analysis. The irreducible background is mainly due to the \(q\overline{q},qg\to\gamma\gamma\)x processes at up to order \(\alpha^{2}\alpha_{s}\) (namely the Born and Bremsstrahlung contributions) and the \(gg\to\gamma\gamma\) up to order \(\alpha^{2}\alpha_{s}^{3}\) (referred to as the box contribution). Contributions from photons produced collinear to quarks are also taken into account at NLO. The DIPHOX [33] and ResBos [34, 35, 36] programs are used to assess the irreducible background computation. DIPHOX includes all the processes to order \(\alpha^{2}\alpha_{s}\), including the Bremsstrahlung contribution with the quasi collinear fragmentation of quarks and gluons which are computed at NLO. DIPHOX does not include resummation effects. ResBos includes the Born and box contributions at NLO as well as the bremsstrahlung contribution (but the fragmentation contribution is only at LO). ResBos includes resummation effects to NNLL.

In these computations, a parton level isolation cut of 15 GeV in a cone of \(\Delta R=0.4\) is used. This is checked against the real photon identification cuts using PYTHIA fully simulated events. DIPHOX and ResBos predictions for the total irreducible background agree to better than 10% [37].

Table 1 shows the cross-sections used to normalize the MC generation in the inclusive analysis. The cross-sections for \(q\overline{q},qg\to\gamma\gamma\)x and \(gg\to\gamma\gamma\) quoted in Table 1 were computed with ResBos for \(80<m_{\gamma\gamma}<150\,\) GeV, where \(m_{\gamma\gamma}\) is the invariant mass of the diphoton system, and \(p_{T\gamma}>25\,\) GeV, where \(p_{T\gamma}\) is the transverse momentum of the photons. Photons are required to lie in the central region of the detector, \(|\eta|<2.5\). The factorization and renormalization scales are set dynamically as the invariant

mass of the diphoton system.

In order to evaluate irreducible backgrounds for signal-significance computations and to include the effect of high-\(p_{T}\) jets, the ALPGEN MC generator is used [38, 39].2 This includes \(2\to N\) tree-level Matrix Elements, where \(N=2-5\). The minimum parton \(p_{T}\) and maximum pseudorapidity are set to \(20\,\GeV\) and \(|\eta|<5\), respectively. A prescription for the merging of matrix elements and parton showers is used [41]. The \(p_{T}\) threshold for the merging of the parton shower and the Matrix Elements is set to \(20\,\GeV\) and \(\Delta R=0.7\).

Footnote 2: This generation does not include the box contribution nor the electroweak \(\gamma\gamma jj\) process. The latter is generated with the MadGraph package [40] and it is used in the Higgs boson searches in association with hadronic jets only (see Sections 5.2 and 5.3).

The total cross-section of the ALPGEN samples of \(\gamma\gamma+\)jets events is normalized to the cross-section given in Table 1. The diphoton invariant mass and transverse momentum spectra are re-weighted to the corresponding spectra obtained with ResBos for the Born and Bremsstrahlung contributions. This is motivated by the fact that ResBos provides a NNLL description of the resummation effects that significantly affects the \(p_{T}\) spectrum of the diphoton system up to about \(40\) or \(50\,\GeV\).

The box contribution is simulated with the PYTHIA package using the leading order one loop Matrix Elements with full and fast detector simulations. The cross-section of this sample is normalized to the cross-section given in Table 1. The diphoton invariant mass and momentum spectra are re-weighted to the corresponding spectra obtained with ResBos.

The total inclusive cross-section for the \(\gamma j\) process is obtained using the package JETPHOX [42]. This package simulates direct and fragmentation single photon production. The distribution of the photon \(p_{T}\) that is obtained is compared with that for direct production predicted using the PYTHIA package. It is observed that the differential cross-section obtained with JETPHOX is a factor of 2.1 larger than that obtained with PYTHIA, with a weak \(p_{T}\) dependence. Table 1 shows the cross-section for inclusive \(\gamma j\) production for \(p_{T\gamma}>25\,\GeV\).

The inclusive dijet cross-section is computed with the help of the NLOJET++ package [43, 44], which takes into account QCD NLO corrections. The dijet cross-section obtained with this program is found to be a factor of 1.3 larger than that obtained with PYTHIA. Table 1 shows the cross-section for inclusive dijet production for \(p_{T}>25\,\GeV\).

For purposes of signal significance computation the ALPGEN MC package is used to generate samples of \(\gamma\)+jets and multi-jets with a fast detector simulation. ALPGEN includes \(2\to N\) tree-level Matrix Elements, where \(N=2-5\). The minimum parton \(p_{T}\) and pseudorapidity range are set to \(20\,\GeV\) and \(|\eta|<6\), respectively. The same matching conditions as in the \(\gamma\gamma+\)jets sample are used. The samples generated with ALPGEN are normalized to cross-sections given in Table 1.

A small background contribution is expected from Drell-Yan \(e^{+}e^{-}\) faking a photon pair. For this purpose 420k events were generated using the PYTHIA package with a full detector simulation. The generator cross-section after requiring one lepton with \(p_{T}>10\,\GeV\) and \(|\eta|<2.7\) is 1.23 nb.

Specific backgrounds contributing to the Higgs boson plus lepton and Higgs boson plus missing transverse energy channels are also produced. \(W/Z\) + diphoton backgrounds can produce the same topology as the signal. To evaluate the contributions from these backgrounds, the MadGraph [40] generator, which includes the \(Z\) and \(W\) bosons produced in association with two photons with tree-level diagrams has been used. The cross-sections for these processes, including the leptonic branching ratios, are shown in Table 2, requiring that the photons have \(p_{T}>20\,\GeV\) and \(|\eta|<2.7\), and that the invariant mass of the two photons be between 90 and \(150\,\GeV\).

The \(c\bar{c}\gamma\gamma\), \(b\bar{b}\gamma\gamma\) and \(t\bar{t}\gamma\gamma\) cross-sections shown in Table 2 do not include the branching ratios of leptonic decays. For the \(b\bar{b}\gamma\gamma\) process the transverse momentum of the b quark is required to be greater than \(20\,\GeV\). In the \(t\bar{t}\gamma\gamma\) events, also produced by MadGraph, the photons only come from the top quarks. The contribution from events in which photons arise from the decay products of the \(t\bar{t}\) system was roughtly evaluated. Events were generated with PYTHIA using the Matrix Elements for the \(t\bar{t}\) process. The production of two additional high \(p_{T}\) photons coming from the final state radiation of the top quark decay products was evaluated. It was found that the \(t\bar{t}\gamma\gamma\) background needs to be multiplied by a factor 7.5 to account for this effect: this factor was applied for the analysis of the associated channel. It is probably conservative because the photons radiated by the quarks should not be isolated and would be removed by the analysis cuts.

There is a contribution to the background from events with a \(W\) boson and a photon, where the \(W\) boson decays into an electron and a neutrino. In some events, the electron can be mis-reconstructed as a photon. The PYTHIA generator is used for this background and the cross-section, including the leptonic branching ratio, is given in Table 2 after requiring \(p_{T}>20\) GeV and \(|\eta|<2.7\) for both the photon and the electron. For all the processes in Table 2 a full detector simulation was used and QED radiative corrections to the \(Z/W\) decays were treated with PHOTOS [45].

## 3 Photon selection and \(\gamma\gamma\) reconstruction

### Photon reconstruction and calibration

Photons in the calorimeter are reconstructed from clusters of different sizes: in the barrel region (\(|\eta|<1.37\) ) a \(\Delta\eta\)x\(\Delta\phi=3\)x7 cluster (in units of middle sampling calorimeter cells) is used for converted photons to recover as much as possible the energy that might be lost due to the opening of the two electrons in the magnetic field. A 3x5 cluster is used for unconverted photons. In the endcap region (\(1.52<|\eta|<2.37\) ) a 5x5 cluster has been used for both converted and unconverted photons. The chosen cluster sizes are a compromise between maximal energy containment and minimization of the noise. In the simulation, all the effects that contribute to the calorimeter resolution constant term, which by design should be kept below 0.7%, are taken into account by smearing the reconstructed cells energies. The energy of the photons in the electromagnetic (EM) calorimeter has been reconstructed using appropriate weights for the presampler and back compartments of the calorimeter to correct for the energy lost in the material in front of the calorimeter, for the longitudinal leakage and for the energy losses outside the cluster. Different weights for unconverted photons and electrons are used, as derived from the nominal detector geometry (see Ref. [46] for details). Clusters are then corrected for a series of effects. The

\end{table}
Table 2: Event generators and cross-sections for backgrounds used in the analyses of associated production. Photons are required to be in \(|\eta|<2.7\) and to have \(p_{T}>20\) GeV. For the \(W^{\pm}(\to e^{\pm}\nu)\gamma\) process the electron is required to pass the same cuts as the photons. The diphoton invariant mass should be in the interval \(90<m_{\gamma\gamma}<150\) GeV, when appropriate. For the \(b\bar{b}\gamma\gamma\) process the \(p_{T}\) of the b quark is required to be greater than 20 GeV.

variations of the energy with respect to the impact point inside each cell are corrected for. These effects are due to the fact that the shower is not fully contained inside the cluster (the effect is larger for small cluster sizes) and to the calorimeter material structure in \(\phi\). The photon candidate position is defined as the barycenter of the associated cluster: the fact that the cells have a finite granularity introduces a bias in the measured position which is corrected for as a function of the particle impact point within the central cell (more details in Ref. [46]).

### Photon identification

Powerful photon identification is required to reduce the background from jets faking photons (from \(jj\) events and \(\gamma j\) events) below the irreducible background. The photon identification relies on the fine segmentation of the electromagnetic calorimeter, especially the first layer, allowing an event-by-event rejection of "isolated" \(\pi^{0}\)s, which are the main source of fake photons from jets. The details of the shower-shape variables and the cuts can be found in Ref. [47]. The shower-shape variables include the leakage in the first compartment of the hadronic calorimeter, variables characterizing the lateral size of the shower in the second layer of the EM calorimeter, and variables related to the transverse size in the first layer of the EM calorimeter, together with a search for a second maximum in \(\eta\) in the energy deposited in the strips of the first layer. The average efficiency of the calorimeter cuts for photons from Higgs boson decays with \(p_{T}>25\) GeV has been found to be \(~{}83\%\) when pile-up corresponding to \(10^{33}\)cm\({}^{-2}\)s\({}^{-1}\) instantaneous luminosity is added. A track isolation cut is also applied to reduce further the fake background: the sum of the \(p_{T}\) of tracks in a \(\Delta R=0.3\) cone around the cluster position is computed for tracks with \(p_{T}>1\) GeV and a cut at 4 GeV is applied. For tracks with \(\Delta R<0.1\) of the cluster position additional cuts are applied to remove conversion tracks from the sum. The efficiency of this cut for photons fulfilling all other identification cuts is \(~{}98\%\)[47]. The cuts have been optimized using photons from Higgs boson decays as a signal sample and an inclusive jet sample for the fake rate study. The optimisation of the cuts has been done mostly in the \(E_{T}\) range \(25-35\) GeV and the same cuts are applied to converted and unconverted photons. Table 3 shows the rejection factors for inclusive jets (normalized to jets found from the simulated particles without detector effects using a cone of size \(\Delta R=0.4\)), as measured from the inclusive jet sample. The rejection is also given separately for quark and gluon jets. The difference in rejection comes from the different fragmentation. After all cuts, the dominant background comes from "single" \(\pi^{0}\)s. The uncertainty on the rejection (uncertainty on the fragmentation, modeling of the detector response) is close to a factor of two [47].

### Conversion reconstruction

Considering Higgs boson decays with photons within \(|\eta|<2.5\), about \(57\%\) of the selected events have at least one true conversion with a radius smaller than \(80\) cm. Converted photons may start showering before the beginning of the calorimeter thereby degrading the energy resolution. In addition, the energy deposition in the calorimeter from a converted photon is geometrically broader in \(\phi\) than that from an

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{l c c c} \hline \hline  & All & quark-jet & gluon-jet \\ \hline Rejection (before isolation) & 5070\(\pm\)120 & 1770\(\pm\)50 & 15000\(\pm\)700 \\ Rejection (after isolation) & 8160\(\pm\)250 & 2760\(\pm\)100 & 27500\(\pm\)2000 \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}

unconverted photon due to the magnetic field in the Inner Detector cavity. On the other hand when a photon from a Higgs boson decay converts, the measurement of the conversion radius can be used to improve the accuracy on the measurement of the photon direction (see Section 3.4).

Conversions are reconstructed by a vertexing algorithm using the reconstructed particle tracks, as explained in more detail in Ref. [48]. An electromagnetic cluster with an associated track which is one of the two tracks of a conversion, is classified as a _double track conversion_. When a photon converts and only one reconstructed track is associated to the corresponding cluster this photon may be mis-identified as an electron: in order to increase the conversion reconstruction efficiency when an electromagnetic cluster has an associated track with no B-layer hit and the associated track does not belong to a reconstructed double track conversion, this object is classified as a _single track conversion_. Including single track conversions in the analysis increases by \(\approx 6\%\) the signal efficiency while the overall background is increased by approximately the same factor. The conversion reconstruction efficiency as a function of the conversion radius is shown in Fig. 1: with the reconstruction software version used for this analysis, the overall efficiency is \(\approx 66.4\%\) for conversions with a radius below \(40\) cm. The different contributions from single-track and double-track conversion reconstruction are also shown.

For a given electromagnetic cluster, more than one associated reconstructed conversion can be found: multiple conversions are due to secondary conversions or fake conversions. Fake conversions arise from two tracks that do not come from a conversion or with only one of the two tracks coming from a conversion. In the case of multiple conversions, the conversion with the smallest radius is selected: the reconstructed conversion is then correctly associated to a converted photon from a Higgs boson decay in \(97.6\%\) of simulated signal cases.

The jet contribution to the total background can be evaluated from the analysis of converted photons (see Ref. [48] for more details and updated results). The presence of tracks associated to the conversion provides a measurement of the transverse momentum of the converted photon in the tracker and consequently an evaluation of the ratio \(p_{T}/E_{T}\), where \(E_{T}\) is the transverse energy of the calorimeter cluster. This variable should be distributed between 0 and 1. As shown in Fig. 2, converted photons have values of \(p_{T}/E_{T}\) which populate the region around 1 with a large non Gaussian tail to lower values due to bremsstrahlung of the electrons. In contrast, the distribution expected for a converted photon from a \(\pi^{0}\) with the same transverse energy peaks at much lower values since the cluster collects the full energy of both photons from \(\pi^{0}\) decay. It is particularly instructive to note that Fig. 2 also shows that the expected distributions for \(p_{T}/E_{T}\) for jets passing all the photon identification cuts is very similar to that obtained

Figure 1: Efficiency of single-track and double-track conversion reconstruction as a function of the conversion radius.

from single \(\pi^{0}\)'s with the same transverse energy: this indicates that the residual background from jets is dominated by single \(\pi^{0}\)'s. The shapes in Fig. 2 for converted photons coming from a jet and converted photons from the direct process can be parametrized and used to discriminate between the two components in a data sample of conversion events, allowing an evaluation of the \(\gamma j\) and \(jj\) percentage in the background.

### Primary vertex reconstruction

Among the reconstructed photons passing the identification cuts, the two with highest \(p_{T}\) are assumed to come from the Higgs boson decay. The azimuthal angle \(\phi\) is determined by the cluster barycenter in the second layer of the EM calorimeter. The pseudorapidity \(\eta\) relies on the knowledge of the position \(z_{H}\) at which the Higgs boson is produced and decays.

Exploiting the multi-layer structure of the EM calorimeter, an estimate of the direction of each photon can be achieved by fitting a straight line in the \((R,z)\) plane through the cluster barycenters detected in the presampler and in the first and second samplings of the EM calorimeter. The intercept of these lines with the ATLAS beam axis provides two independent measurements of the hard scattering vertex, \(z_{\gamma 1}\) and \(z_{\gamma 2}\) with their uncertainties. They are combined in a weighted average with the nominal interaction vertex at \(z_{0}=0\) which has a spread of \(\pm 56\) mm to yield a calorimeter estimate, \(z_{H}^{\rm calo}\), of the primary vertex. The performance expected for \(H\to\gamma\gamma\) events is displayed in Table 4 and Fig. 3 (left plot). The accuracy (RMS) of the primary vertex position reconstruction is 13 mm, 17 mm, 41 mm, when both photons are in the barrel, one in the barrel and one in the endcap, and both in the endcap. In the simulation of the events used for this analysis a 4mm shift of the electromagnetic calorimeter along the z-axis was introduced (see Ref. [49] for more details) with respect to the nominal position. This effect has been taken into account at the reconstruction level, recalculating the pseudorapidity of the cells in each calorimeter layer with respect to the interaction point taking as a radial position reference the geometrical center (in the radial direction) of the cell. To compute the photon direction, the pointing algorithm makes use of the radial position of the barycenter of the shower instead of the geometrical center of the cell biasing the distribution of the reconstructed primary vertex position obtained from calorimeter pointing with respect to the true position as shown in Fig. 3, left plot (see Ref. [50] for more details). When a conversion is reconstructed, its coordinates are added as an extra point to the straight line fit, thus improving the Higgs boson vertex position accuracy; the distribution exhibits large tails with an RMS of 8 mm and a narrow Gaussian core with a width of 0.15 mm.

Figure 2: \(p_{T}/E_{T}\) ratio for conversions where both tracks were reconstructed in different event samples.

By adding the reconstructed primary vertex to the linear fit, the best Higgs boson position accuracy is achieved, with a Gaussian width of 0.07 mm (see Table 4 and Fig. 3, plot on the right). In the case of pile-up, more than one primary vertex may be reconstructed by the inner detectors. The discrimination of the hard-scattering vertex from pile-up vertices is done using a likelihood that is a combination of the calorimeter information and the sum of the squares of the \(p_{T}\)s of the tracks originating from the vertex (named \(P_{T}^{2}\) in the following). So

\[\mathcal{L}=\mathcal{L}_{P_{T}^{2}}\times\mathcal{L}_{calo} \tag{1}\]

where

\[\mathcal{L}_{P_{T}^{2}}=p_{H}(p_{T}^{2})/p_{MB}(p_{T}^{2}) \tag{2}\]

\[\mathcal{L}_{calo}=e^{-\frac{1}{2}\frac{z^{2}}{56^{2}}}\times e^{-\frac{1}{2} \frac{(z-z_{calo})^{2}}{\alpha_{calo}^{2}}}/e^{-\frac{1}{2}\frac{z^{2}}{56^{2} }}=e^{-\frac{1}{2}\frac{(z-z_{calo})^{2}}{\alpha_{calo}^{2}}} \tag{3}\]

The first component of the likelihood, \(\mathcal{L}_{PT2}\), is, for a certain value of \(P_{T}^{2}\), the probability for the Higgs boson vertex to have this \(P_{T}^{2}\) divided by the same probability for a minimum bias vertex. The second component is the product of the probabilities that a measured vertex is that of the Higgs boson vertex divided by the probability that the measured vertex position is that of a minimum bias vertex. The vertex misidentification due to pile-up is displayed by the columns labeled 'tail' in Table 4. When the vertex associated to the Higgs boson production is correctly identified among the others, the impact of the direction measurement on the invariant mass resolution becomes negligible with respect to that of the energy measurement.

### Invariant mass and signal acceptances

The invariant mass of diphoton pairs has been reconstructed for different signal samples using the tools described in the previous Sections: the 2g17i trigger selection (see Section 4 for more details) is applied and two identified photons are required to be reconstructed with \(p_{T}>40\) GeV and \(p_{T}>25\) GeV within the fiducial region of \(0<|\eta|<1.37\) and \(1.52<|\eta|<2.37\). Fig. 4 presents the invariant mass distributions of \(\gamma\gamma\) pairs from Higgs boson decay with \(m_{H}=120\) GeV. The shaded histograms correspond to events with at least one true converted photon with a conversion radius smaller than 80 cm. The converted photons are currently calibrated at the electron scale and the unconverted ones at the photon scale: in the case of the geometry with additional material in front of the calorimeter, the observed difference

between the peak of the distribution of events with no conversions and the one with at least one reconstructed conversion is around 1 %. In the future a specific calibration will be implemented for converted photons using the same prescription as that used for electrons and unconverted photons.

To be consistent with previous studies ([4], [3]) the mass resolution obtained for the photon pairs has been determined from an asymmetric Gaussian fit ([-2 \(\sigma\), + 3 \(\sigma\)]) of the invariant mass peak. The asymmetric window is used to reduce the impact of the residual low energy tails in the reported width. Table 5 shows the results for different Higgs boson masses with and without pileup at \(10^{33}\) cm\({}^{-2}\)s\({}^{-1}\) in the case of simulations with additional dead material in front of the calorimeter (see Ref. [49] for more details). Since the energy calibration coefficients have been calculated using the nominal geometry, the presence of additional dead material in front of the calorimeter affects the determination of the value of the invariant mass, moving the peak mean down by a few per mille. In addition it increases the amount of low energy tails: the percentage of events with a reconstructed invariant mass more than 3\(\sigma\) from the mean increases from 3.5 % for the nominal geometry to 6.8 % for the distorted geometry. The acceptances after trigger selection (see Section 4 for more details) and analysis cuts together with the mass resolutions for the different values of \(m_{H}\) are reported in Table 5. The mass window for the evaluation of the signal significance (denoted _mass bin_) is defined as \(\pm 1.4\,\sigma\) around the central value. As can be seen in Table 5 the fraction of signal events in the mass bin is 26 % for \(m_{H}=120\)  slightly increasing with the Higgs boson mass. The relative mass resolution \(\sigma_{m}/m\) is close to 1.2 % degrading by a few percent relative when the pileup is added.

### Background analysis on fully simulated samples

Large samples of \(\gamma\gamma\) and \(\gamma j\) events as well as Drell-Yan \(Z\to e^{+}e^{-}\) were generated with PYTHIA and fully simulated. The differential cross-section at LO as a function of the diphoton invariant mass for \(\gamma j\) and \(e^{+}e^{-}\) events after the analysis procedure described in previous sections is reported in Fig. 5. For the

The narrow peak on top of the broader one is due to events in which at least one photon has a reconstructed conversion vertex. In the right plots, the non-Gaussian shape is due to the overlap of barrel-barrel, barrel-endcap and endcap-endcap topologies, which have different resolutions.

\(jj\) background contribution evaluation not enough statistic was available in full simulation and it has been estimated only from fast simulated events using photon efficiency and the jet rejection parametrizations obtained from full simulation.

The goodness of the photon efficiency and jet rejection parametrizations used in Section 5 on fast simulated events to estimate the background contributions has been tested on the \(\gamma j\) sample in full simulation: the distribution of the cross-section as a function of the diphoton candidates invariant mass has found to be in agreement within 15 % in the 110-150 GeV mass range with the distribution from the fast simulated sample after photon efficiency and jet rejection parametrization used in Section 5.

### Jet tagging in simulation

Section 5 presents two analyses which rely on tagging hadronic jets. Jet tagging is particularly relevant to Higgs boson searches in association with two high \(p_{T}\) jets since such an analysis is intended to isolate Higgs boson production via VBF.

In the VBF production process, it is expected that the two quark-initiated jets are observed in opposite

The shaded histograms correspond to events with at least one converted photon.

hemispheres and with a large separation in pseudorapidity. Tagging these jets further suppresses the background processes. Furthermore, since there is no colour exchange between the two quarks, the Higgs boson should be observed in a large rapidity gap, where additional activity from QCD jets is small. A central jet veto (CJV) which suppresses the background processes is therefore used in the event selection,

The relative efficiencies for jet tagging are summarized in Table 6. The following four conditions are applied:

* two simulated quarks with \(p_{T}>40\)  and \(p_{T}>20\) (\(|\eta|<5\)) and in opposite hemispheres,
* two reconstructed jets with \(p_{T}>40\)  and \(p_{T}>20\) (\(|\eta|<5\)),
* the two reconstructed jets are in opposite hemispheres,
* differences in \(\eta\) between the simulated quarks and the reconstructed jets are smaller than 0.4 (this is referred to as matching).

The present tagging method selects correct tagging jets in 75.7% of the events. Under a pileup condition of \(10^{33}\mathrm{cm}^{-2}\mathrm{s}^{-1}\), a degradation of less than 5% is observed. The difference between HERWIG and PYTHIA is about 6%.

## 4 Performance of the photon trigger on events.

There are two trigger selections which are foreseen for the \(H\to\gamma\gamma\) analyses: 2g17i and g55. The 2g17i trigger selects events with at least two isolated photons and is efficient for photon \(p_{T}\) above 20. The

\begin{table}

Figure 5: Diphoton candidates invariant mass distribution for \(\gamma j\) (left) and Drell-Yan \(e^{+}e^{-}\)(right) events after photon identification and analysis cuts with and without trigger selection.

g55 trigger selects events with at least one photon and is efficient for photon \(p_{T}\) above 60. No isolation is required in the g55 trigger. In the analyses presented in Section 5 only the 2g17i menu has been considered to avoid possible biases in the invariant mass reconstruction: a more detailed description of the photon selection at the High Level Trigger is available [51]. The photon reconstruction at the trigger level relies only on calorimetric information. To calculate \(E_{T}\) and shower shapes variables the High Level Trigger uses algorithms similar to those used for offline analysis using information from the first and second sampling of the calorimeter. For photon trigger menus the isolation is only applied at L1 trigger.

The trigger efficiency has been evaluated for Higgs boson events having two offline reconstructed photons passing the following kinematic cuts: two photons with \(p_{T\gamma}>25\) and \(p_{T\gamma}>40\)  respectively both in the region 0\(<|\eta|<\)1.37 and 1.52\(<|\eta|<\)2.37, passing the identification cuts described in Section 3.2.

Table 7 shows in the first column the efficiency of the 2g17i menu item to select \(H\to\gamma\gamma\) events after each trigger level.

The 2g17i trigger menu item is expected to be \(\sim\)94% efficient for triggering on Higgs boson decays with two reconstructed photons. The efficiency loss is mainly due to the calorimeter isolation at L1 which is not applied in the offline photon selection.

Trigger rates for 2g17i are studied in the context of the ATLAS trigger development. This trigger is found to be usable (unprescaled) up to luminosities of \(10^{33}\,\mathrm{cm}^{-2}\mathrm{s}^{-1}\)[51].

## 5 Event selection

In this Section the analysis details of the various event selections are described. The event selection for the inclusive analysis is given in Section 5.1 and for the Higgs boson search in association with jets are given in Sections 5.2 and 5.3. Finally, the event selections for diphoton searches in association with missing transverse momentum and charged leptons are given in Sections 5.4 and 5.5. Here the various event selections are presented as disjoint analyses. In Section 7 the statistical power of these channels is combined and their impact on the Higgs boson discovery potential is evaluated.

### Inclusive analysis

The inclusive analysis refers to the search for a resonance in events with two photons that pass certain quality criteria. The analysis reported here follows closely the event selection of past studies [3, 4]. The detector performance and optimization studies succinctly presented in Sections 3 and 4 are geared toward maximizing the discovery potential of the inclusive analysis.

The following cuts are applied:

**Ia**: At least two photon candidates (see Section 3.2) in the central detector region defined as \(|\eta|<2.37\) excluding the transition region between barrel and endcap calorimeters, \(1.37<|\eta|<1.52\) (_crack_ in the following). At this level it is required that the event passes the trigger selection (see Section 4).

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{c c} \hline \hline Trigger Level & 2g17i Trigger efficiency \\ \hline L1 & 96.3\(\pm\)0.3 \\ L2 Calo & 95.0\(\pm\)0.4 \\ EF Calo & 93.6\(\pm\)0.4 \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 7: Efficiency for the 2g17i menu item to trigger on \(H\to\gamma\gamma\) events with \(m_{H}=120\), normalized with respect to the offline selections.

**Ia**: Transverse momentum cuts of \(40,25\) GeV on the leading and sub-leading photon candidates, respectively.

The fiducial cuts in **Ia** are motivated by the quality of the off-line photon identification and the fake photon rate (see Section 3.2). The values of the cuts on the transverse momentum of the photon candidates (cut **Ib**) are not varied and are obtained from previous optimization studies [3].

Figure 6 shows the expected diphoton mass spectrum after the application of cuts **Ia** and **Ib**. The hashed histogram in the bottom corresponds to the contributions from events with one and two fake photons. The second hashed histogram corresponds to the irreducible backgrounds (see Section 2.2). The background contributions are obtained with MC samples with a fast detector simulation normalized to the cross-sections specified in Section 2.2. The fast detector simulation is corrected in order to reproduce the aspects of the detector performance critical to the analysis, which are obtained with a full detector simulation (see Sections 3 and 4). The expected contribution from a Higgs boson signal for \(m_{H}=120\) GeV, obtained with a full detector simulation, is also shown in Fig. 6.

Table 8 shows the expected cross-sections (in fb) for background and signal in a mass window of \(\pm 1.4\) of the mass resolution in the no pileup case reported in Table 5 around \(120\) GeV after the application of cuts **Ia** and **Ib**. Table 8 indicates that the relative contribution from events with at least one fake photon constitutes 39% of the total background, about a factor of two larger than evaluated in Ref. [4]. This increase is mostly attributed to three factors. Firstly, a different method for the parametrization of the fake photon background is used here. Secondly, the budget of inactive material in front of the first layer of the calorimeter has increased with respect to the one used in previous studies. Finally, the contribution from fragmentation in the \(\gamma j\) process (see Section 2.2) is allowed for here for the first time.

#### 5.1.1 Theoretical uncertainties on background prediction

In this Section the theoretical uncertainties of the predictions for prompt single and double photon production used in the inclusive analysis are evaluated.

The irreducible background rate is evaluated using ResBos[34, 35, 36], which implements a full matrix element calculation at NLO and the resummed formalism. It thus yields an accurate description of the low \(p_{T\gamma\gamma}\) region, as corroborated by recent Tevatron results [52]. In the high diphoton transverse momentum, \(p_{T\gamma\gamma}\), domain the precision of its prediction needs to be assessed. To account for the incompleteness of the fixed order calculation two approaches are used: both the renormalisation and factorisation scales (\(\mu_{R,F}\)) are varied, from \(0.5\times m_{\gamma\gamma}\) to \(2\times m_{\gamma\gamma}\), first assuming \(\mu_{R}=\mu_{F}\) then independently.

ResBos does not provide the most accurate description of the fragmentation of partons into photons. In particular, it implements the single-photon fragmentation only at LO. An improved estimation of this contribution is given by the DIPHOX program [33] which implements single and double-photon fragmentation at NLO. The predictions of the fragmentation and direct contributions of the two aforementioned calculations agree to within 6%.

The systematic uncertainty related to the parton distribution functions is studied in Ref. [53] and estimated to be of the order of 6%. Systematic uncertainties related to the irreducible background evaluation are summarised in Table 9 they amount to an overall relative uncertainty of 16%.

A similar study has been performed with JETPHOX in order to evaluate theoretical uncertainties of the \(\gamma j\) process. The second column of Table 9 reports the results from this study.3)

Footnote 3: It is important to note that the uncertainty of the contribution of the reducible background is dominated by the uncertainty in the determination of the fake photon rejection. This uncertainty may be significantly larger than the uncertainties quoted in Table 9.

### Higgs boson plus one jet analysis

In this Section and in Section 5.3 two event selections are presented that take into account the presence and properties of high \(p_{T}\) hadronic jets in association with the photon pair. This analysis follows earlier

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{c c|c c} \hline \hline Signal Process & Cross-section (fb) & Background Process & Cross-section (fb) \\ \hline \(gg\to H\) & 21 & \(\gamma\gamma\) & 562 \\ VBF \(H\) & 2.7 & Reducible \(\gamma j\) & 318 \\ \(ttH\) & 0.35 & Reducible \(jj\) & 49 \\ \(VH\) & 1.3 & \(Z\to e^{+}e^{-}\) & 18 \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}

\begin{tabular}{c c c} \hline \hline Potential sources & \(\gamma\gamma\) & \(\gamma j\) \\ \hline Scale dependence & 14\% & 20\% \\ Fragmentation & 5\% & 1\% \\ PDF & 6\% & 7\% \\ \hline Total & 16\% & 21\% \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}

studies in ATLAS using a fast detector simulation [8].

Parton level studies have indicated that searches for the Higgs boson in association with at least one high \(p_{T}\) jet may have a strong discovery potential [5]. This analysis exploits mainly the fact that the gluon radiation pattern of the two leading Higgs boson production mechanisms differs strongly from the one expected for the reducible and irreducible backgrounds. The leading jet in the \(gg\to Hj\) and \(VBF\) mechanisms tends to be harder and be more separated from the diphoton system than in background events. The invariant mass of the two photons and the jet system discriminates well the signal from the background.

The following event selection is chosen after the application of cut **Ia**:

* Transverse momentum cuts of 45 and 25 GeV on the leading and sub-leading photon candidates, respectively.
* Presence of at least one hadronic jet with \(p_{T}>20\) GeV in \(|\eta|<5\).
* A cut on the invariant mass of the diphoton and the leading jet, \(m_{\gamma\gamma j}>350\) GeV.

The lower bound on the jet \(p_{T}\) is dictated by the ability to calibrate hadronic jets in ATLAS [54]. The large hadronic activity due to the underlying events and multiple proton-proton interactions at the LHC, in conjunction to the significant amount of inactive material before the calorimeter, may make it difficult to lower the \(p_{T}\) threshold. The variable \(m_{\gamma\gamma j}\) is the main discriminator used here to improve the signal-to-background ratio. Other discriminating variables could be used to further enhance the analysis sensitivity [5].

Figure 7 displays the resulting diphoton invariant mass spectrum after the application of cuts **Ia** and **IIa-IIc**.

Tables 10 and 11 display the expected cross-sections for signal and background events in the range \(110<m_{\gamma\gamma}<150\) GeV after the application of cuts **Ia** and **IIa-IIc**. Table 10 illustrates that the leading Higgs boson production mechanism after the application of cuts remains the \(gg\to Hj\) process, closely

followed by the VBF mechanism. It is important to note that the \(gg\to Hj\) process has been evaluated at LO ignoring the large QCD NLO corrections.

### Higgs boson plus two jets analysis

This Section considers an event selection comprising two photons in association with two high \(p_{T}\) jets, or tagging jets. In this analysis the tagging jets are defined as the two leading jets in the event. The \(VBF\) Higgs boson process at LO produces two high \(p_{T}\) and relatively forward jets in opposite hemispheres (backward-forward). The pseudorapidity gap and invariant mass of these jets tend to be significantly larger than those expected for background processes. The NLO description of the VBF process does not significantly distort this picture.4

Footnote 4: About 10% of the VBF events display the feature that a radiated gluon coming from one of the quark lines happens to become a tagging jet. In this class of events the pseudorapidity gap and the invariant mass of the tagging jets appears similar to that displayed by a typical QCD background process. This effect is well reproduced by the HERWIG generator.

A number of variables are chosen that are sensitive to the different kinematics displayed by the signal and background processes [9]. The following is the optimized event selection after the application of cut **Ia**:

* Transverse momentum cuts of 50 and 25 GeV on the leading and sub-leading photon candidates, respectively.
* Presence of at least two hadronic jets in \(|\eta|<5\) with \(p_{T}>40,20\) GeV for the leading and sub-leading jet, respectively. The tagging jets must be in opposite hemispheres, \(\eta_{j1}\cdot\eta_{j2}<0\), where

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:18]

**IIIa-IIIe**. Table 12 shows that the dominant Higgs boson production mechanism surviving the events selection is the VBF mechanism. Unfortunately, the QCD NLO corrections to the main backgrounds included in Table 13 are not known and therefore these results suffer from large theoretical uncertainties.

The event selections presented in this and the previous Sections have a certain degree of overlap. This is particularly relevant for the VBF Higgs boson production mechanism. In Section 7 the signal significance of a combined analysis is presented that takes into account the event overlap.

### Higgs boson plus missing transverse energy and isolated leptons

The main signal production mechanism contributing to a category of events with two photons, missing transverse energy and isolated leptons will be from \(WH\to\ell\nu\gamma\gamma\) and \(t\bar{t}H\). The basic selection requires the presence of two energetic photons, missing transverse momentum, and one high energetic lepton. The main backgrounds for this channel are \(t\bar{t}\gamma\gamma\), \(W\gamma\gamma\) where the \(W\) decays to \(\ell\nu\) and \(W\gamma\to e\nu\gamma\) where the other photon is radiated by the electron or is a fake photon from an additional jet.5 This latter background is multiplied by a factor 2 to include the \(W\gamma\to\mu\nu\gamma\) contribution. Another important background turns out to be \(\gamma\gamma\) and \(\gamma j\), when fake electrons or muons are reconstructed. ALPGEN was used to produce the diphoton background including a full simulation of the detector. The cross section was multiplied by a factor 1.4 to account approximately for the box diagram (40% of the contribution, see Table 1). For reducible backgrounds (68% contribution, see Table 8), the cross-section of the diphoton background is scaled by a factor 1.68. It is difficult to evaluate the accuracy of this approximation but this diphoton process is not the leading background. A multivariate analysis based on various kinematical variables would require very large Monte Carlo samples for the backgrounds. Here, a simple set of basic event selection criteria is chosen:

Footnote 5: Note that there is some double counting when both \(W\gamma\) and \(W\gamma\gamma\) are included.

* The first selection criterion sets minima on the transverse momenta of the two reconstructed photons. The cut requires the \(p_{T}\) of the most energetic photon to be higher than 60  and the \(p_{T}\) of the second more energetic photon to be above 30. Events where one of the two photons is reconstructed in the crack region are rejected. The cross-sections in the first line of the table 14 are given in the mass range between 110 and 150.
* Requiring a cut that the transverse momentum of the most energetic isolated lepton (electron or muon) be higher than 30 suppresses efficiently the diphoton and \(W\gamma\) backgrounds. Only the

electrons passing a tight electron identification cut are selected.
* The diphoton background can further be strongly suppressed by requiring missing transverse energy higher than \(30\,\GeV\).
* When an electron is reconstructed, events are removed in with either of the invariant masses of the electron and each of the photons is close to the \(Z\) mass (between 80 and 100 ): this cut removes the events coming from the \((Z/\gamma^{*})+\gamma\to e^{+}e^{-}\gamma\) when an electron is reconstructed as a photon.

Table 14: Expected cross-sections (in fb) for the Higgs boson with missing transverse energy and lepton analysis for \(m_{H}=120\,\GeV\). Results are given after the application of cuts **IVa-IVc** (see Section 5.4) in the mass range \(110<m_{\gamma\gamma}<150\,\GeV\). In the last row the expected cross-sections within a mass window of \(m_{\gamma\gamma}\) of \(\pm 2\,\GeV\) around \(120\,\GeV\) are given.

Figure 9: Expected distribution of the invariant mass of the two photons for the signals and main backgrounds after applying the analysis cuts for events having one lepton reconstructed in the final state. Due to a lack of MC statistics for the diphoton and the \(W\gamma\) backgrounds, their expected distribution is approximated by showing an average of the number of events passing the analysis cuts in the \(m_{\gamma\gamma}\) mass range shown.

Table 14 summarizes the expected cross-sections for the principal signal and backgrounds after the various cuts used in the analysis. The uncertainty in the background level, due to Monte Carlo statistics only, is estimated to be 10%. However, the background contribution in this analysis can have larger sources of systematic uncertainties. The resulting Higgs boson mass peak and background are shown in Fig. 9 after all cuts have been applied. The reconstructed mass resolution is \(1.47\,\GeV\).

### Higgs boson plus missing transverse energy

This analysis is intended to select principally the \(ZH\to\nu\nu\gamma\gamma\) events. In order to have an analysis independent from that of Section 5.4, only events which do not have a reconstructed lepton with \(p_{T}>30\,\GeV\) have been considered here. It should be noted that cases where the lepton is of low \(p_{T}\) or did not pass the tight selection criterion are included. Thus the \(WH\) signal contributes significantly. The main features are the presence of two energetic photons from the Higgs boson and a large transverse missing energy. The dominant backgrounds for this channel are the \(t\bar{t}\gamma\gamma\), \(Z\gamma\gamma\) and \(W\gamma\to e\nu\gamma\) channels where, in the latter case, the electron can be mis-reconstructed as a photon or the second photon is either radiated by the electron or is a fake photon. Here, the diphoton background is multiplied by the same factors as in Section 5.4 and the \(t\bar{t}\gamma\gamma\) by the factor 7.5 as explained in Section 2.2.

* As in Section 5.4, a cut on the transverse momentum of the most energetic photon above \(60\,\GeV\) and a cut on the second more energetic photon \(p_{T}\) of \(30\,\GeV\) are applied to suppress the diphoton background. Events where one of the two photons is reconstructed in the crack region are then removed.
* The selection is then based mostly on the requirement of high missing transverse momentum. A cut of \(E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}>80\,\GeV\) suppresses almost completely the \(\gamma\gamma\) background while reducing the \(W\gamma\) background by a factor 20 and the \(ZH\to\nu\nu\gamma\gamma\) signal by a factor 2.
* In order to further suppress the \(W\gamma\) background, where the electron is often reconstructed as a converted photon, events where either of the photons appears to have converted are rejected.
* At this point, because of potentially significant background from QCD events, difficult to evaluate, a cut requiring that the scalar sum of the \(p_{T}\) of the jets in the event be larger than \(150\,\GeV\) is imposed. It suppresses the contribution from the \(t\bar{t}\gamma\gamma\) and \(b\bar{b}\gamma\gamma\) backgrounds, as well as of the \(t\bar{t}H\) signal.

Table 15 summarizes the expected cross-sections after the different cuts applied for this analysis for signal and backgrounds. The expected mass distributions of diphotons from the associated \(W/Z\) plus Higgs boson and from the backgrounds are shown in Fig. 10, after the application of all cuts. To account for the \(W\gamma\to\mu\nu\gamma\), the \(W\gamma\to e\nu\gamma\) background has been multiplied by two in the figure although some double counting is introduced. The uncertainty in the background level, due to Monte Carlo statistics only, is estimated to be 15%. The reconstructed mass resolution is \(1.31\,\GeV\). This result is expected to be sensitive to uncertainties in the simulation and reconstruction of \(E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}\) tails.

## 6 Maximum-likelihood fit

An unbinned extended multivariate maximum-likelihood fit to extract the \(H\to\gamma\gamma\) signal and background event yields is performed. With respect to the cut analysis presented in Section 5, the fit takes advantage of further discrimination information from the kinematic and topological properties of \(H\to\gamma\gamma\) decays. In addition to the diphoton invariant mass, \(m_{\gamma\gamma}\), the transverse momentum of the Higgs boson, \(P_{T,H}\), and the magnitude of the photon decay angle in the Higgs boson rest frame with respect to the Higgsboson lab flight direction, \(|\cos\theta^{\star}|\), are included. To reduce the model dependence, the most relevant parameters describing the probability density functions (PDF) for the dominant background are freely varied and determined simultaneously with the event yields by the fit. Only the parametric shapes of the PDFs are obtained from Monte Carlo simulation. Sufficient background statistics in the sidebands must be retained to ensure that the floating shape parameters do not increase the statistical errors on the signal yield. The \(m_{\gamma\gamma}\) resolution depends on the diphotons' pseudorapidities, with core Gaussian widths varying between 1.2 and 3. Disjoint pseudorapidity regions (denoted _categories_), are defined such that the \(m_{\gamma\gamma}\) resolution is similar for events belonging to the same category, and maximally different for events of different categories. The \(m_{\gamma\gamma}\) resolution also depends on whether or not photons have converted at an early stage in the material in front of the calorimeter (see Section 3.3). \(H\to\gamma\gamma\) events can have zero, one or two reconstructed conversions, which are split into corresponding categories. Following Section 5 disjoint categories are also introduced for events accompanied by zero, one and two or more jets, where the last category contains predominantly VBF events. The use of categories separates sub-populations of events with different properties and hence improves the accuracy of the likelihood model.

The signal and background samples used to build the likelihood model are selected with the criteria described in Section 5. The full detector simulation is used for signal processes, while the background processes are generated with the fast simulation. The trigger and photon identification efficiencies, and the misidentification in background events are parametrised using the full detector simulation. The probability of a photon to convert into an \(e^{+}e^{-}\) pair with one or two tracks being reconstructed, and the energy resolution of the converted photon are parametrised using the full detector simulation.

### Likelihood model

The probability density function, \(P_{i}^{c}\), for an event \(i\) in category \(c\) is the weighted sum of the probability densities of all components, namely \(P_{i}^{c}=N_{H}f_{H}^{c}P_{i,i}^{c}+\sum_{j=1}^{n_{\rm{kg}}}N_{B_{j}}^{c}P_{B_{ j},i}^{c}\), where \(N_{H}\) is the number of \(H\to\gamma\gamma\) signal events determined by the fit,6\(f_{H}^{c}\) is the fraction of signal events in category \(c\) (\(c=1,\ldots,n_{\rm{cat}}\), note that \(\sum_{c}f_{H}^{c}=1\)) taken from simulation, and \(N_{B_{j}}^{c}\) is the number of background events of type \(j\) (\(j=1,\ldots,n_{\rm{bgg}}\)) found in category \(c\), which is determined from the fit. The signal and background PDFs \(P_{U,i}^{c}\), with \(U=H,B_{j}\), are the products \(P_{U,i}^{c}=\prod_{k=1}^{n_{\rm{var}}}p_{U}^{c}(x_{k,i})\) of the PDFs \(p_{U}^{c}(x_{k,i})\) of the discriminating variables \(x_{k,i}\), \(k=1,\ldots,n_{\rm{var}}\), used in the fit. The extended likelihood over all categories and events is given by \({\cal L}=\prod_{c=1}^{n_{\rm{cat}}}e^{-\overline{N}}\prod_{i=1}^{N^{c}}P_{i}^ {c}\), where \(\overline{N}^{c}\) (\(N^{c}\)) is the total number of events expected (observed) in

Results are given after the application of cuts **Va-Vd** (see Section 5.5) in the mass range \(110<m_{\gamma\gamma}<150\).

category \(c\) with \(c=1,\ldots,n_{\rm cat}\). The PDFs \(P_{U,i}^{c}\) depend on parameters (coefficients) that may be freely varying in the fit. The parametrisations and hence the adjustable parameters differ between categories in general, but can also span over several categories.

### Fit variables

The \(H\to\gamma\gamma\) distribution of \(m_{\gamma\gamma}\) forms a Gaussian peak with tails to lower values from photon energy losses before the calorimeter. It is well modeled by a _Crystal Ball_ (CB) function [55]

\[p_{H}(m_{\gamma\gamma})=N\cdot\left\{\begin{array}{ll}\exp\left(-t^{2}/2 \right)\,,&\mbox{for $t>-\alpha$}\,,\\ (n/|\alpha|)^{n}\cdot\exp\left(-|\alpha|^{2}/2\right)\cdot(n/|\alpha|-|\alpha| -t)^{-n}\,,&\mbox{otherwise}\,,\end{array}\right. \tag{4}\]

where \(t=(m_{\gamma\gamma}-m_{H}-\delta_{m_{H}})/\sigma(m_{\gamma\gamma})\), \(N\) is a normalisation parameter, \(m_{H}\) is the Higgs boson mass, \(\delta_{m_{H}}\) is a category dependent offset, \(\sigma\) represents the diphoton invariant mass resolution, and where \(n\) and \(\alpha\) parametrise the non-Gaussian tail. To catch outliers an additional broad tail Gaussian is added to Equation 4, which is, however, only relevant for events falling into the "bad" \(m_{\gamma\gamma}\) category (see Section 6.3). Within a sufficiently narrow mass window, the background distribution of \(m_{\gamma\gamma}\) forms an exponential tail described by a single slope parameter \(\xi\).

Because of the large available statistics for simulated signal samples, shape uncertainties due to deficiencies in the functional description are negligible. Systematic effects are due to simulation inaccuracies and are discussed in Section 7. A high-fidelity description of the background PDFs is mandatory because the large majority of the events entering the fit are of that type. It is achieved by flexible parametrisations with a sufficient number of parameters determined by the fit, ensuring a stable fit result with respect to shape redefinitions.

The distribution of \(|\cos\theta^{\star}|\) for a scalar Higgs boson is uniform. However, acceptance effects, primarily from the minimum \(p_{T}\) requirements for the photons (See Section 5.1), suppress \(|\cos\theta^{\star}|\) values towards one, where the photons are collinear with the Higgs boson lab frame momentum. The empirical signal PDF is interpolated by a double Gaussian function. The phase space for background events from

Figure 10: Expected distribution of the invariant mass of the two photons for the signals and main backgrounds after applying all the diphoton and \(E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}\) analysis cuts. Due to a lack of statistics for the diphoton and the \(W\gamma\) backgrounds, their expected distribution is approximated by showing an average of the number of events passing the analysis cuts in the \(m_{\gamma\gamma}\) mass range shown.

\(t\)-channel graphs and quark or gluon fragmentation at NLO is enhanced for photons collinear with the diphoton lab momentum, so that the background \(|\cos\theta^{\star}|\) distribution exhibits some clustering towards large values. Acceptance suppression competes, however, with this enhancement thus reducing the discrimination power of the variable. It is found that the \(|\cos\theta^{\star}|\) distributions differ significantly between the \(\gamma\gamma\), \(\gamma j\) and \(jj\) backgrounds, with stronger enhancements at large \(|\cos\theta^{\star}|\) values for the backgrounds originating from jet misidentification. The inclusive shape of these backgrounds is parametrised by the sum of a positively defined third order polynomial and two Gaussian functions. The inclusive signal and background distributions of \(|\cos\theta^{\star}|\) for events with and without jets are shown in Fig. 11.

The Higgs boson transverse momentum exhibits a strong rise at low values and a long exponential tail beyond the maximum. The distribution is fitted by a sum of two bifurcated Gaussian functions (distributions where below and above the center half Gaussian distributions with different widths are used) and one symmetric Gaussian. The diphoton transverse momentum distribution for background is softer than that for signal and can be described by the sum of three exponential polynomials (see Fig. 11).

### Fit categories

Eight photon pseudorapidity regions with different diphoton invariant mass resolution for \(H\to\gamma\gamma\) events are identified. They are illustrated in Fig. 12 for unconverted photon pairs (left plot) and events with at least one photon conversion (right plot). The regions are chosen to be symmetric with respect to an

Figure 11: Signal (left) and background (right) distributions of the Higgs boson decay angle, \(|\cos\theta^{\star}|\) (top), and the diphoton transverse momentum (bottom) for events with zero jets (full dots), one jet (open circles) and VBF topology (full triangles, not shown for background because of a too low relative cross-section). The corresponding PDF parametrisations are overlaid (see text).

interchange of the photons. The crack region is excluded from the photon selection. The \(m_{\gamma\gamma}\) RMS values vary between 1.3  in the centre and large-\(\eta\) regions to 3.1  in the regions closely beyond the crack. To simplify the likelihood model, the eight regions are merged into three categories that are distinguished in the fit (see Fig. 12).

Two categories are introduced to separate events without and with at least one photon conversion to take account of the worse resolution of the latter events. Photon conversions reconstructed with one or two tracks are not explicitly distinguished. Additional categories are introduced for Higgs boson production with zero, one, and two or more accompanying jets, using the requirements described in Sections 5.2 and 5.3. No separate categories are introduced in the present analysis to distinguish Higgs boson production in association with a \(W\) and \(Z\) boson or a \(t\bar{t}\) quark pair; these are included in the previous selections. Separating them would add some power, but would increase the complexity.

### Correlations

The likelihood product used to derive the event PDF \(P_{U}^{c}\) ignores correlations between the discriminating variables \(x_{k}\). The classification in categories of events with distinct properties improves the accuracy of this assumption. The remaining (positive) linear correlation coefficients is lower than 7% (10%) for signal (background) events among the three fit variables tolerable.

### Fit performance

Studies are performed involving large samples of toy MC simulation to assess the discovery potential for fits using likelihood models of increasing complexity.7) The abundance of signal and background

Figure 12: Regions of photon pseudorapidities with different invariant mass resolutions for unconverted photons (left) and at least one converted photon (right). The text per box denotes the region number, the percentage of events occurring in the region and the RMS of the diphoton invariant mass for \(H\to\gamma\gamma\) events. To simplify the likelihood model, events with photons in regions (1) and (8) are merged and represent category “good” (signal fraction 24%), events in regions (2), (3), (4) and (6) correspond to category “medium” (60%), and regions (5) and (7) are “bad” (15%).

events used in these fits is tuned to the NLO expectation for \(10\,\mathrm{fb}^{-1}\) of integrated luminosity, taking into account the trigger and reconstruction acceptance.

The results for fits with fixed and floating Higgs boson mass (the latter only done for the \(m_{\gamma\gamma}\)-only and the full fits) are summarised in Table 16. For each toy MC sample we perform two fits, one with floating signal yield and another with zero signal to test the background-only hypothesis. The log-likelihood difference, \(\Delta\ln\mathcal{L}\), found in these fits, estimates the false discovery probability (p-value). The \(\langle\Delta\ln\mathcal{L}\rangle\) values given in Table 16 are obtained from Gaussian fits to well-behaved pull distributions. For fixed Higgs boson mass, the signal significance in terms of \(\sigma\) can be approximated by the quantity \(\sqrt{-2\Delta\ln\mathcal{L}}\). For floating Higgs boson mass, the extra degree of freedom in the fit yields a higher value of \(\langle\Delta\ln\mathcal{L}\rangle\). However in this case the p-value and significance must be evaluated with toy MC simulation of background-only samples. As expected, the obtained significances are lower than in the fixed mass case, in spite of the higher \(\langle\Delta\ln\mathcal{L}\rangle\) values.

## 7 Discovery potential

This Section reports on the potential for the discovery of a Higgs boson in the mass range \(120<m_{H}<140\) GeV using the event counting computation and the maximum likelihood fit formalism (see Section 6). The signal significance is evaluated for each of the analyses presented in Section 5. The discovery reach is given for a combined analysis including the utilization of additional discriminating variables. The last signifies the maximum discovery potential for a Standard Model Higgs boson in the mass range specified above.

Table 17 shows the signal and background effective cross-sections for the different analyses presented

Table 16: \(H\to\gamma\gamma\) discovery potential for a Higgs boson mass of \(120\,\mathrm{GeV}\), various likelihood setups and a simulated integrated luminosity of \(10\,\mathrm{fb}^{-1}\). The left column gives the discriminating variables used in the fit, the second column the categories, the third (fifth) column the average \(\Delta\ln\mathcal{L}\) and its statistical uncertainty as derived from the toy MC samples, and the fourth (sixth) column quotes the estimated Gaussian signal significance in units of one standard deviation. Due to the background dominance, the variance of the significance in the toy experiments is approximately one. The fits have been performed with fixed Higgs boson mass (Higgs boson mass floating within \([112,128]\) GeV). The significance for floating Higgs boson mass has been obtained with toy MC simulation (the \(\Delta\ln\mathcal{L}\) cannot be directly interpreted in terms of significance and is given for completeness only). Due to the large number of required toy MC fits it has not been computed for the most involved fit with highest expected significance.

in Section 5 as a function of the Higgs boson mass.8) Table 18 displays the corresponding expected signal significances for \(10\,\mathrm{fb}^{-1}\) of integrated luminosity. The first sub-column under each analysis shows the signal significance based on event counting, \(\sigma(S,B)\), where \(S\) and \(B\) correspond to the number of signal and background events in a mass window of \(\pm 1.4\,\sigma_{\gamma\gamma}\) around \(m_{H}\), respectively, and where \(\sigma_{\gamma\gamma}\) is the mass resolution (in the no pileup case reported in Table 5).9) The values of \(\sigma(S,B)\) reported in Table 18 can be compared with earlier studies performed by the ATLAS collaboration [2, 3, 4, 8, 9]. The inclusion of pileup decreases the event counting signal significance by at most 10%.

Footnote 8): The contribution from Drell-Yan is computed for the inclusive analysis only.

The signal significances reported in the second and third sub-column under each analysis, \(\sigma_{1D}^{Fix}\) and \(\sigma_{1D}^{Float}\), are obtained by means of a one dimensional fit using the diphoton invariant mass as a discriminating variable by letting the Higgs boson mass fixed and floated, respectively.10) Each analysis is treated independently from each other. In these fits the Higgs boson mass is let free in the range \(110<m_{H}<140\) GeV (except for \(m_{H}=140\) GeV for which the range was set to \(120<m_{H}<150\) GeV) to take into account for the coverage of the analysis.11) The results in Table 18 do not take into account the event overlap among the three analyses. The last column reports the event counting signal significance of the three analyses combined, taking into account the event overlap.

Footnote 9): The event counting significance for the inclusive and \(H+1\)jet analyses are approximated by \(S/\sqrt{B}\). For the rest of the analyses a Poisson-based computation is used due to the small expected number of background events for \(10\,\mathrm{fb}^{-1}\) of integrated luminosity.

Footnote 10): For the sake of simplicity, the fit-based signal significance does not include the Drell-Yan contribution.

Footnote 11): The range of the fit to the background is set to \(110<m_{H}<150\) GeV.

Table 18 illustrates that the inclusive search for a diphoton resonance is the most sensitive one for a search of a Standard Model Higgs boson. As reported in Section 2, the inclusive analysis is evaluated

The discovery potential of \(H+1\)jet analysis could be further enhanced if QCD NLO corrections were applied on both signal and reducible backgrounds [56, 57].

Table 19 shows two fit-based signal significances compared to \(\sigma_{1D}^{Fix}\) and \(\sigma_{1D}^{Float}\) reported in Table 18. The values of \(\sigma_{C_{1}3D}^{Fix}\) and \(\sigma_{C_{1}3D}^{Float}\) correspond to the signal significance computed by means of a three dimensional fit, including \(m_{\gamma\gamma},P_{T,H}\) and \(|\cos\theta^{\star}|\) (see Section 6.2) by means of fixing and floating the mass, respectively. At this stage the event classification according to \(|\eta|\) regions is used (see Section 6.3).12) The values of \(\sigma_{C_{2}3D}^{Fix}\) and \(\sigma_{C_{2}3D}^{Float}\) correspond to the maximum achievable sensitivity of all the analyses reported in Section 5 combined. In addition to the procedure followed to obtain \(\sigma_{C_{1}3D}^{Fix}\) and \(\sigma_{C_{1}3D}^{Float}\), a classification of events according to the presence of hadronic jets is used.

Footnote 12): For the final results presented in this section, a simplified fitting model as well as a more conservative classification are used with respect to those considered for Table 16. In particular the diphoton category with two jets is not split into \(\eta\) categories and the conversion categories are not used.

Figure 13 displays a summary of the expected signal significance for the inclusive and final combined analysis for \(10\,\mathrm{fb}^{-1}\) of integrated luminosity as a function of the Higgs boson mass. The solid circles correspond to the sensitivity of the inclusive analysis reported in Section 5.1 using event counting with background and signal rates assumed. The solid triangles linked with solid and dashed lines correspond to the sensitivity of the inclusive analysis by means of one dimensional fits, with a fixed and floating Higgs boson mass, respectively. The solid squares linked with solid and dashed lines correspond to the values of \(\sigma_{C_{1}3D}^{Fix}\) and \(\sigma_{C_{1}3D}^{Float}\) given in Table 19, respectively.

The stability of the fits are checked against changes in the composition of the background. The values of \(\sigma_{1D}^{Fix}\) for the inclusive analysis are recomputed by increasing and decreasing the reducible background by a factor of two. The fits are redone with the same functional forms as in the nominal analysis and the results are consistent with the expectations obtained by using \(S/\sqrt{B}\).

The degradation of the Higgs boson discovery sensitivity due to systematic uncertainties is considered. Various sources of systematic errors are evaluated. The Higgs boson mass resolution has significant impact on the sensitivity. A large degradation of the Higgs boson mass resolution is chosen by the addition of a \(1\,\%\) constant term in the photon energy resolution. The impact of Higgs boson mass resolution is evaluated for the inclusive analysis by means of one-dimensional fits with a fixed Higgs boson mass. If the resolution is increased both in toy Monte Carlo experiments and in the fitting function a decrease of \(8\%\) in the signal sensitivity is observed. If, however, the resolution is only degraded in toy Monte Carlo experiments, so that the fitting model does not accommodate the Higgs boson mass resolution degradation, then the effect is a \(12\%\) reduction in sensitivity.

Table 19: Signal significances (expressed in terms of Gaussian \(\sigma\)s) for a Standard Model Higgs boson as a function of the mass for \(10\,\mathrm{fb}^{-1}\) of integrated luminosity. Different fit-based approaches are used. The significances, \(\sigma_{1D}^{Fix}\), \(\sigma_{C_{1}3D}^{Fix}\) and \(\sigma_{C_{2}3D}^{Fix}\) correspond to a one dimensional fit, to a three dimensional fit using the first type of event classification and to a three dimensional fit (see Section 6.2) using all classifications considered in Section 6.3, respectively using a fix Higgs boson mass (see text). The significances \(\sigma_{1D}^{Float}\), \(\sigma_{C_{1}3D}^{Float}\) and \(\sigma_{C_{2}3D}^{Float}\), correspond to fit based results obtained with a floating Higgs boson mass.

The systematic uncertainty due to \(P_{T,H}\) has been estimated by using PYTHIA signal events, reweighted to NLO using ResBos, and fitted with the nominal model based on MC@NLO event simulation. This inconsistency between generation and fit reduces the significance of the full fit (including all categories and the variables \(m_{\gamma\gamma}\), \(P_{T,H}\), and \(|\cos\theta^{*}|\), see Table 16) by 5%.

The sensitivity of the associated production channels has been studied separately for the diphoton + \(E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}\) + lepton and for the diphoton + \(E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}\) analyses (see Sections 5.4-5.5). With 30 fb\({}^{-1}\) these channels have the potential to contribute to the overall discovery signal of a SM Higgs boson, but we choose not to report the value of the signal significance because the systematic uncertainties on the background normalization are large given the present status of simulations.

## 8 Conclusions

The feasibility of the search for a Standard Model Higgs boson in the \(H\to\gamma\gamma\) decay with the ATLAS detector at the LHC has been presented. The detector performance issues relevant to the search have been evaluated using a full detector simulation. Triggering effects and the impact of pile-up are also reported. A signal significance based on event counting of 2.6 (4.6) can be obtained with 10 (30) fb\({}^{-1}\) of integrated luminosity for \(m_{H}=120\)  in the case of inclusive analysis. Despite the slight degradation with respect to previous studies, the feasibility of the search for a Standard Model Higgs boson in the \(H\to\gamma\gamma\) decay is confirmed. In addition to the inclusive analysis the search for diphotons in association with jets is considered. The addition of these channels enhances the event counting signal significance to 3.3 (5.7) with 10 (30) fb\({}^{-1}\) of integrated luminosity for \(m_{H}=120\). The expected sensitivity can be enhanced by means of an unbinned maximum-likelihood fit dividing the data sample into categories depending on the event topology and exploiting a number of discriminating variables: the increase in

Figure 13: Expected signal significance for a Higgs boson using the \(H\to\gamma\gamma\) decay for 10 fb\({}^{-1}\) of integrated luminosity as a function of the mass. The solid circles correspond to the sensitivity of the inclusive analysis reported in Section 5.1 using event counting. The open circles display the event counting significance when the Higgs boson plus jet analyses (see Sections 5.2 and 5.3) are included. The solid triangles linked with solid and dashed lines correspond to the sensitivity of the inclusive analysis by means of one dimensional fits, with a fixed and floating Higgs boson mass, respectively. The solid squares linked with solid and dashed lines correspond to the maximum sensitivity that can be attained with a combined analysis (see text and Table 19).

the discovery potential increases up to 3.6 (2.8) in the case of fixed (floating) mass fit for 10 fb\({}^{-1}\) of integrated luminosity.

The search for \(H\to\gamma\gamma\) in association with \(Z/W\) or \(t\bar{t}\) has been addressed, indicating that a good signal-to-background ratio can be achieved. However, the uncertainty on the background contribution in these analyses is large given the present status of simulations.
