**Studies of \(t\bar{t}c\bar{c}\) production with MadGraph5_aMC@NLO and Herwig++ for the ATLAS experiment**

The ATLAS Collaboration

**Abstract**

Studies of the simulation of \(t\bar{t}c\bar{c}\) at the LHC, at a centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV, based on next-to-leading order calculations with MadGraph5_aMC@NLO matched to Herwig++ are presented. Samples with \(t\bar{t}c\bar{c}\) in the three flavour scheme, in a next-to-leading order matrix element are compared to an inclusive \(t\bar{t}\) sample with the charm contribution coming from the parton shower. The effects of generator-level cuts, the functional form of the renormalization and factorization scales, and the starting scale of the parton shower are investigated.

## 1 Introduction

Top quark pair production in association with \(c\)-quarks (\(t\bar{t}c\bar{c}\) ) is a significant background to many searches and in particular to the measurement of top-associated Higgs production in the \(H\to b\overline{b}\) decay channel [1; 2]. Its theoretical prediction is complicated by the fact that it involves several scales within the same event and massive quarks. Recent ATLAS analyses use samples produced with a next-to-leading order (NLO) matrix element (ME) for the inclusive top quark pair production and rely on the parton shower (PS) for the prediction of \(c\bar{c}\)-quark pair production [1]. While the approximations made in the PS ansatz are considered to be appropriate for the colinear and soft gluon splitting into a \(c\bar{c}\) pair, limitations are expected for large angular separation or high \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) of the \(c\)-jets. One would expect the latter type of events to be better described by \(c\)-quark production in the matrix element, whereas the PS approach might indeed be the better approximation for close-by \(c\)-quarks that are reconstructed within the same jet.

Another issue concerns the treatment of the charm quark mass. Top quark pair production has typical scales of the order of the top quark mass and the question arises whether the \(t\bar{t}c\bar{c}\) process is better approximated by a massless treatment in a four or five flavour scheme (4FS, 5FS), or by a three flavour scheme (3FS) with charm quark mass of \(m_{c}\sim 1.5\,\mathrm{GeV}\). With no infrared singularities for massive quarks, the 3FS naturally extends over the full phase space. However, when using the 3FS the non-perturbative effects have to be small enough such that the lack of \(g\to c\bar{c}\) resummation does not critically impact the results. The use of non-zero quark masses was justified for the case of \(t\bar{t}b\bar{b}\)  in Ref. [3] but we are not aware of any similar study involving \(c\)-quarks. Similarly, several phenomenological studies (see e.g. Refs. [4; 5; 6]) exist on aspects of top quark pair production in association with \(b\)-quarks (\(t\bar{t}b\bar{b}\) ), but none on \(t\bar{t}c\bar{c}\). Unfortunately, there is also no direct measurement of \(t\bar{t}c\bar{c}\)  at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) with sufficient precision to give guidance to discriminate between predictions [7].

In this note we perform an initial study of \(c\overline{c}\) pair production in association with top quarks for 13 TeV proton-proton collisions at the LHC by comparing different ME and PS calculations and investigate the influence of generation cuts and scale choices. We use MadGraph5_aMC@NLO [8] and Herwig++ [9; 10] for the study with massive charm quarks in the 3FS and various scales and PS settings. We compare to inclusive \(t\bar{t}\) samples at NLO using the same generator, with additional \(c\)-quarks predominantly produced in the PS. Additionally, the predictions are compared to a Sherpa[11] sample using the 5FS with massless charm quarks calculated using an NLO ME for \(t\bar{t}\) with 0 or 1 jet and leading order (LO) for 2, 3, or 4 jets.

Section 2 reports on the parameter settings for the production and the different samples that were produced. Section 3 analyses differential distributions of \(t\bar{t}c\bar{c}\)  events and their dependence on the parameter settings. In Section 4 we conclude on the findings.

## 2 Generator Configurations

The cross section predictions and the hard process were generated at next-to-leading order using MadGraph5_aMC@NLO  version 2.3.2. MadSpin[8] was used to simulate the decay of the top quarks and the \(W\) bosons. The resulting partons were matched to Herwig++  version 2.7.1 to include the effects of the parton shower, hadronization and multi-parton interactions. The UE-EE-5 Herwig++  tune was used in conjunction with the corresponding CTEQ6L1 Parton Distribution Function (PDF) [12] in the parton shower and the underlying event (UE). The angular-ordered parton shower was run with the default valuefor the strong coupling of \(\alpha_{s}(m_{Z})=0.12\) obtained by the Herwig++ authors from tuning to LEP data. Decays of \(b\)-quarks are handled by EvtGen[13]. The top quark mass was set to \(m_{t}=172.5\) GeV in all samples and a filter was applied during production to select events in the dilepton and single-lepton decay channels. Predictions of top quark pair production associated with two massive \(c\)-quarks were calculated using the 3FS with quark masses of \(m_{c}=1.55\) GeV and \(m_{b}=4.95\) GeV and the CT10f3[14] PDF via LHAPDF [15].

In the samples the jets produced in the hard process are required to have a \(p_{T}\) of at least 5 GeV with no requirement on \(\eta\)1. For this, jets were built from partons using the anti-\(k_{t}\) algorithm [16] with a radius of \(R=0.4\) using FastJet[17]. The predictions were done both with and without the minimal jet \(p_{T}\) requirement applied to the jets initiated by \(c\)-quarks. This behaviour was steered using the maxjetflavor parameter2. It was seen that applying the cut to \(c\)-quarks significantly reduces the rate of failures in event generation.

Footnote 1: ATLAS uses a right-handed coordinate system with its origin at the nominal interaction point (IP) in the centre of the detector and the \(z\)-axis along the beam pipe. The \(x\)-axis points from the IP to the centre of the LHC ring, and the \(y\)-axis points upwards. Cylindrical coordinates \((r,\phi)\) are used in the transverse plane, \(\phi\) being the azimuthal angle around the \(z\)-axis. The pseudorapidity is defined in terms of the polar angle \(\theta\) as \(\eta=-\ln\tan(\theta/2)\). Angular distance is measured in units of \(\Delta R\equiv\sqrt{(\Delta\eta)^{2}+(\Delta\phi)^{2}}\).

The study was performed using the \(\mathrm{H_{T}}/4\) and CMMPS [5] scales as defined in Table 1 for the renormalization and factorization scales \(\mu_{R}\) and \(\mu_{F}\). Since the CMMPS scale, which is a generalization of the BDDP scale introduced in [6], can become very soft, a lower bound defined as

\[\mu_{F}=\mu_{R}=\max(\mu_{\mathrm{CMMPS},\,\mu_{\mathrm{fixed}}}) \tag{1}\]

was introduced for this scale, where \(\mu_{\mathrm{fixed}}\) was set to values of \(0,50,80\) and \(150\) GeV. The lowest value for which the event generation ran stably was 50 GeV, and to understand the effect of the lower bound, the choices of 50 and 150 GeV were studied in further detail. Given its different behaviour in the soft limit the \(\mathrm{H_{T}}/4\) scale did not necessitate any fixed lower bound.

The samples were generated from within the ATLAS software framework using the 'gridpack' option in the interface for MadGraph5_aMC@NLO. In this procedure the process libraries are generated, compiled and the integration grids are set up in one step. The resulting gridpack is subsequently used for the actual event generation which is done in parallel jobs, thus avoiding duplication of the setup step. Where

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{l l l} \hline \hline Scale name & Definition & Behaviour for \(p_{T,i}\to 0\) \\ \hline \(H_{T}/4\) & \(\mu=\frac{1}{4}\sum_{i\in F\,S}E_{T,i}\) & \(\mu\to\frac{1}{4}\sum_{i\in F\,S}m_{i}\approx 87.03\) GeV \\ \hline BDDP & \(\mu=\sqrt{m_{t}\cdot\sqrt{p_{T,c}\cdot p_{T,\tilde{c}}}}\) & \(\mu\to 0\) GeV \\ \hline CMMPS & \(\mu=\prod_{i=t,\tilde{t},c,\tilde{c}}E_{T,i}^{1/4}\) & \(\mu\to\prod_{i=t,\tilde{t},c,\tilde{c}}m_{i}^{1/4}\approx 16.35\) GeV \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}

The transverse energy is given by \(E_{T,i}=\sqrt{m_{t}^{2}+p_{T,i}^{2}}\) where \(m_{i}\) denotes the mass of any final state parton. The masses of the top and charm quarks are given by \(m_{t}\) and \(m_{c}\), respectively. The BDDP scale is shown for comparison only and is not used for the studies in this note.

possible the recommended accuracy was used for the integration grids, corresponding to an accuracy of approximately 0.1% on the total cross section3.

Footnote 3: The accuracy of the integration grids included in the gridpacks can be steered via the req_acc parameter in the MadGraph5_aMC@NLO run card. It sets the goodness of the integration done prior to the event generation and is approximately equal to the numerical precision of the total cross section calculated during the integration.

Different parameter settings in terms of the value of the minimal jet \(p_{T}\), the inclusion of the charm quarks in the jet cut and the lower bound for the CMMPS scale were tried. For some of the tested configurations technical problems were encountered which prevented the generation of events and motivate the setup used in the following with the \(c\)-quarks being included in jet cuts of \(p_{T}\geq 5\) GeV and a lower bound of at least 50 GeV for the CMMPS scale.

Variations on the scales were performed by varying simultaneously the hard process renormalization and factorization scales by factors of 0.5 and 2. Table 2 shows the cross sections obtained for the different scale choices along with the statistical and scale uncertainties as well as the efficiencies of the single-lepton and dilepton event filter.

Furthermore, the scale \(Q_{\mathrm{sh}}\), which is passed from MadGraph5_aMC@NLO to the Herwig++ parton shower via the _Les Houches Event (LHE)_ event files and can be interpreted as restricting the hardness of the parton shower emissions, was varied down by factors of 0.5 and 0.254 for the inclusive \(t\bar{t}\) sample following the procedure in Ref. [18]. The scale \(Q_{\mathrm{sh}}\) is calculated for each event and is defined in MadGraph5_aMC@NLO as the partonic centre-of-mass energy multiplied by a factor generated randomly in the interval between 0.1 and 1. A more complete description is given in Section 2.4.4 of Ref. [8] according to which the variation of \(Q_{\mathrm{sh}}\) is an indication of the matching systematics related to the MC@NLO method.

Footnote 4: Since variations of this scale via the MadGraph5_aMC@NLO run card are only possible starting with version 2.3.3 the variations were achieved by simultaneously multiplying the parameters frac_low and frac_upp in the file SubProcesses/madfks_mcatnlo.inc inside the MadGraph5_aMC@NLO process folder with the scale variation factors.

An inclusive top quark pair production sample was generated at NLO with the same parameter settings as above except using the factorization and renormalization scale \(\mu_{F}=\mu_{R}=\sqrt{m_{t}^{2}+\frac{1}{2}(p_{T,t}^{2}+p_{T,\bar{t}}^{2})}\), massless \(c\)-quarks along with the CT10 PDF and jet cuts of \(p_{T}\geq 0.1\) GeV, corresponding to the sample in Ref. [19].

The aforementioned samples are compared to a Sherpa[11] sample generated using v2.1.1 with the MEPS@NLO[20] setup which was also used in Ref. [19]. The events are generated with a \(t\bar{t}\) matrix

The factorization and renormalization scales are defined as \(\mu_{F}=\mu_{R}=\sqrt{m_{t}^{2}+\frac{1}{2}(p_{T,t}^{2}+p_{T,\bar{t}}^{2})}\). The sample makes use of the 5FS with the CT10 PDF and the PS, hadronization and UE are simulated using the default Sherpa settings. For this sample, no tuning to ATLAS data has been performed.

## 3 Analysis

In the following the effect of the different generator setups on the charm jet distributions in a fiducial volume similar to that of a typical ATLAS data analysis is studied.

### Fiducial volume and event categorisation

Particle-level jets are reconstructed from stable particles, excluding muons and neutrinos, using the anti-\(k_{t}\) algorithm with a radius parameter of 0.4 [16]. Jets are required to have a \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) greater than 25 GeV, and a pseudorapidity \(|\eta|\) < 2.5. Jets are labelled as \(b\)- or \(c\)-jets if they are matched to a \(b\)- or \(c\)-hadron with \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) greater than 5 GeV, within \(\Delta R\) of 0.4. Jets matched to both are labelled as \(b\)-jets. If a hadron is within 0.4 of two jets, it is only matched to the closest jet. Top quark decay products, and \(b\)- or \(c\)-hadrons originating from the decay of other \(b\)- or \(c\)-hadrons, are not considered for the matching. Jets matched to two or more \(c\)-hadrons are labelled \(2c\)-jets, while those matched to exactly one \(c\)-hadron are labelled \(1c\).

In order to match the phase space of typical top analyses, events are required to have two \(b\)-jets (including those from top quark decays) and either one lepton (electron or muon) above 25 GeV, or two leptons above 20 GeV. Events which do not contain an additional \(b\)-jet5, but do contain an additional \(c\)-jet (i.e. not from a top quark decay), are classified into one of three categories. Events containing at least two charm jets (\(1c\) or \(2c\)) are labelled \(ttcc\). Events with exactly one \(2c\)-jet and no \(1c\)-jet are labelled \(tt2c\), while those with exactly one \(1c\)-jet and no \(2c\)-jet are labelled \(tt1c\).

Footnote 5: The veto on \(b\)-jets was introduced to be consistent with the ttH analysis settings, but this is expected to be a tiny effect.

### Effect of jet \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) cuts in event generation

As mentioned in Section 2, a minimal \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) requirement of 5 GeV on the parton jets initiated by \(c\)-quarks was necessary to improve the reliability of the event generation. In the following we study the effect of this cut on the charm jet distributions by comparing the \(t\bar{t}c\bar{c}\) sample with the scale \(\mathrm{H_{T}}/4\) produced with and without such a cut. In order to be able to run the production without a cut, the integration grid accuracy was reduced from 0.001 to 0.002 for both samples for this study.

Figure 1 compares the number of additional particle-level charm jets and the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) of the leading charm jet for events with and without jet cut. Even though the jet \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) required is 25 GeV, i.e. significantly higher than the generation cut on the parton jet, an increase in cross section around 10% is observed for events with at least additional charm jet. A significant difference is seen in the zero-jet bin, as most parton-level jets below 5 GeV do not result in a particle-level jet above 25 GeV. There are also large discrepancies in the bins with three or more charm jets, where it is very likely that one has come from the parton shower.

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:6]

GeV minimum are very similar, while Sherpa and CMMPS with a 50 GeV minimum predict significantly more events in all categories and have the largest difference from the \(\mathrm{H_{T}/4}\) sample. Figure 6 shows the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) and \(\eta\) distributions of the leading and subleading charm jets normalized to the predicted cross sections, while Figure 7 compares the shapes for the same distributions. The simulations with a higher cross section for \(t\bar{t}c\bar{c}\) production are seen to have softer leading charm jets, with Sherpa showing by far the largest

The left figure includes all charm jets, while the center has only jets with two or more associated \(c\)-hadrons, and the right has jets with exactly one associated \(c\)-hadron. The band around the \(\mathrm{H_{T}/4}\) sample and the bars on the inclusive sample indicate the effect of simultaneously varying the factorization and renormalization scales by a factor of two. For the other samples, only statistical uncertainties are shown.

effect. No significant difference is seen for the \(\eta\) distributions of the different samples. Additionally, Figures 8 and 9 show kinematics for events with exactly two additional charm jets. At small \(\Delta R\) between the jets, the predictions of CMMPS with a 150 GeV minimum, \(\mathrm{H_{T}}/4\) and inclusive \(t\bar{t}\) agree, while large differences are observed for values greater than 1. As expected, the PS predictions of \(c\bar{c}\) drop significantly for larger separation of the \(c\)-jets, while the predictions with \(c\)-quarks in the ME show a smoother drop towards high \(\Delta R\). Sherpa lies in between the different ME \(t\bar{t}c\bar{c}\) predictions, but has a different shape.

### Effect of shower scale variations

As described in Section 2, additional samples were produced after varying the scale \(Q_{\mathrm{sh}}\), which controls the hardness of the parton shower emissions, by a factor of 0.5 and 0.25. Figure 10 shows the effect on the number of charm jets and the cross section for the various event categories. The shower scale variations have only a small impact compared to varying the scale of the hard process. However, when examining the event kinematics, a larger effect is seen. Figure 11 shows the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) and \(\eta\) of the leading charm jet, while

The left figure includes all charm jets, while the center has only jets with two or more associated \(c\)-hadrons, and the right has jets with exactly one associated \(c\)-hadron. The band around the \(\mathrm{H_{T}}/4\) sample and the bars on the inclusive sample indicate the effect of simultaneously varying the factorization and renormalization scales by a factor of two. For the other samples, only statistical uncertainties are shown. All samples are normalized to unit area.

Figure 12 shows kinematics for events with two charm jets. Varying the shower scale down is seen to soften the \(p_{\rm T}\) spectrum, and to increase the cross section for events with well-separated \(c\)-jets.

## 4 Conclusions

Studies of the production and differential distributions for different MC predictions of the \(t\bar{t}c\bar{c}\)  process have been presented. The comparison included massive or massless charm quarks, different functional forms, variations of the scales and cut-offs of the scale in the ME, MEs with and without charm quarks, different PS cut-offs and different hadronisation models using the generators MadGraph5_aMC@NLO matched to Herwig++ as well as a merged calculation from Sherpa v2.1.1.

Significant variations are observed in both cross sections and differential distributions. However, compared to the change in cross section, the differences in the shape of kinematic distributions are less dramatic when comparing the different functional forms, scale cut-offs and scale variations in the \(t\bar{t}c\bar{c}\)  matrix element. Comparing to the predictions where additional charm jets are produced solely in the PS, some regions of phase space agree well while others show large differences. For instance, the inclusive sample is close to the NLO \(t\bar{t}c\bar{c}\)  predictions for two charm jets that are nearby or very well-separated, but differs significantly for intermediate values of \(\Delta R\). The predictions of Sherpa  are in many cases similar to that of \(t\bar{t}c\bar{c}\)  with CMMPS and the 50 GeV cut-off and significantly different from the ones obtained with the inclusive \(t\bar{t}\) predictions, although Sherpa  is closer to the inclusive sample for nearby charm jets. Sherpa  also shows distinct shape differences in the charm \(p_{\rm T}\) fraction.

This study should be considered as a starting point to investigate systematic uncertainties in the simulation of the \(t\bar{t}c\bar{c}\)  process. It clearly demonstrates that an estimation of the uncertainties on this process based on parton shower calculations of charm production alone is not sufficient. However, there are still many open questions to follow up to reach a similar level of understanding of this process as in the case of \(t\bar{t}b\bar{b}\), including a comparison among shower generators. Though challenging, experimental measurements of \(t\bar{t}c\bar{c}\)  production would be valuable for guiding the theoretical predictions.
