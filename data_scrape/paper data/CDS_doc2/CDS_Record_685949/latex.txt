## 1 Introduction

This note is a brief summary of the results obtained at last autumn towards to the preparation of the ATLAS Technical Proposal. We studied the ATLAS inner tracker performance using our method of the track pattern recognition. Full DICE simulation data were used as input for the study. Efficiencies for recognition of single muons and electrons and fake track rate are studied as functions of the luminosity for the barrel part of the ATLAS inner tracker in different scenarios of tracking and for different layouts of the tracker. As the efficiency we understand a probability to find track whose parameters are equal to generated by Monte Carlo, i.e. we do not consider here values of number of true and false hits accepted for the track. Respectively a fake track has been defined as a track whose parameters significantly differ from those that generated by Monte Carlo, i.e. its hits are obtained as a result of random associations of mini-bias track hits. All tracks found were checked for their presence in the GEANT KINE-banks. This means that all pile-up tracks weren't considered as fake tracks. The global pattern recognition method is applied[1] for the study. This allows one to compare it with the other one[2, 3] and thus to check consistency and possible biases in different approaches to the problem. Left-right ambiguity for the TRT drift time measurements is solved during the track pattern recognition (TPR) procedure. To check the quality of the TPR the final helix fit for accepted hits is applied.

Method of the global pattern recognition.

The global pattern recognition method was used to identify track hits from the total sample of measurements obtained with the simulation of the inner tracker detectors responce.

For the barrel region of the ATLAS inner tracker, the trajectories of particles with not too small momenta should satisfy to the following equations:

\[\left|\varphi_{0}+\frac{1}{2}C\tau_{i}+\frac{d_{0}}{r_{i}}-\varphi_{i}\right|< \epsilon_{i}. \tag{1}\]

\[\left|\tan\lambda_{0}\tau_{i}+z_{0}-z_{i}\right|<\delta_{i}, \tag{2}\]

where \((r_{i},\varphi_{i},z_{i})\) is measured space coordinates of point, \((\varphi_{0},C,d_{0},\tan\lambda_{0},z_{0})\) - parameters of helix.

It should be stressed that any measurement must satisfy to both of the inequalities.

Our definition of the track is a set of at least \(N_{h}\) measurements lying on helix trajectory within their errors.

This method allows one to consider measurements of different types of detectors simultaneously, i.e. to provide the search for tracks in whole inner tracker detector rather than separately for track segments in each of the detectors: TRT, SCT, etc.. Such approach should provide more reliable recognition for complicated cases.

One should note also that the procedure allows one to search for tracks in some restricted regions of helix parameters space. In particular, to restrict a search only to high \(P_{T}\) particles, a parameter \(P_{T,cut}\) is used in further presentation. It has a sense of minimal \(P_{T}\) for which the system of inequalities should be tested.

In this study we were interested in the recognition of tracks which have an origin nearby to the beam line, therefore we assumed a zero value of the impact parameter, \(d_{0}=0\), in the following.

## 3 Data.

In this study samples of single muons and electrons with \(P_{T}=20\) GeV and all values of \(\varphi\) and \(\eta\) obtained with full DICE simulation of the ATLAS inner tracker were used.

Pile-up effects were added using minibias events generated with GENCL program. A Poisson distribution with on the average 25 minimum bias events was used to represent a luminosity of \(L=10^{4}cm^{-2}s^{-1}\).

Only the barrel region of \(|\eta|<0.65\) was considered for this study.

Different scenarios for the pattern recognition conditions study were considered:

1. the TRT stand-alone track recognition;
2. the combined TRT + SCT track recognition;
3. the SCT stand-alone track recognition.

Two different layouts of the SCT were assumed:

1. Panel layout. The SCT data in the Panel layout with default parameters of digitizations, i.e. one layer of pixels at \(r=11.5cm\) with pixel size \(50\)\(\mu m\)\(\times\)\(200\)\(\mu m\) in \(r\varphi\)\(\times\)\(z\) and double-sided crossed strips at \(r=20,\ 30,\ 40,\ 50\) and \(60\) cm with \(50\mu\times 100\mu\), \(75\mu\times 150\mu\), \(100\mu\times 200\mu\), \(100\mu\times 200\mu\) and \(100\mu\times 200\mu\) pitch values, respectively.

### The TRT and the SCT combined tracking

The TPR in the combined variant of the analysis requires a use of both Eq.1 and Eq.2 simultaneously. A variant of such analysing program was developed and tested in some simple cases. It meets, however, some limitations of computer memory. For this study was applied more simple program which provides, nevertheless, a reliable track recognition. It was realised as a two-step procedure. At first step it searches for a set of track candidates using Eq.1, i.e. a recognition in \((r,\varphi)\)-plane in the same manner as it was done for the TRT standalone tracking. All measurements from the TRT and the SCT are considered together as equally valuable, but with their own errors, which for the TRT was taken to be 300 \(\mu m\) while for the SCT it was taken to be a half width of the corresponding detecting element (pixel size, strip width and so on). At second step all found candidates were tested for compatibility with Eq.2.

Helix fit performed for muon tracks of \(P_{T}=20GeV\) shows that we obtain unbiased estimates of all principal track parameters, \(P_{T},\ \varphi_{0},\ \theta_{0}\) and \(z_{0}\) with aid of this procedure. Distributions of these parameter estimates (without pile-up) and their fits to a Gauss form for Panel and TP layouts are shown at Fig.6 and Fig.7, respectively.

Distributions of number of accepted hits at first step and after second step are shown at Fig.8 for Panel layout. No pile-up was included. The distributions for number of accepted hits from the TRT, the SCT and their sum are shown separately. One should note that hits from each side of double-sided strips are considered as different ones. To work with pile-up track hits included, some cuts were chosen for each step of the procedure. At first step we demand to have at least 30 accepted hits from both detectors together. After second step a candidate should have at least 20 hits to be taken as a real track. Fig.9 shows analogous distributions for the case when 50 minibias events in the average are included for the search of tracks with \(P_{T}>2GeV\). True tracks (solid histogram) and fake tracks (dashed histogram) are shown separately. One may observe that the most useful variable for further separation of true and fake tracks is a number of hits accepted from the SCT after second step of our procedure.

Fig.10 shows the fake track rate \((P_{T}>2GeV)\) and the efficiency to find true track as functions of minimum number of SCT hits required on the track for Panel layout. Results are given for two values of luminosity. One should remember that all real tracks going from minibias events were subtracted using information from KINE-banks of generated events. The expected rate of tracks from minibias events with \(P_{T}>2GeV\) at luminosity \(L=2\cdot 10^{34}cm^{-2}s^{-1}\) in a window \(\Delta\eta\times\Delta\varphi=0.20\times 0.18\) is about 0.01. If one requires more than \(5\div 6\) SCT hits on the reconstructed track, the fake track rate is well below 10% of the real tracks from the pile-up, while the efficiency would be better than 97 \(\div\) 99%.

One should note that after completion of this study it was discovered that the fake track rates shown at Fig.10 are dominated by real tracks from secondary decays and interactions. These tracks could not be subtracted from the fake track sample because the GEANT KINE-banks did not contain corresponding information. They are low-energetic ones with \(P_{T}<3\div 4GeV\) and therefore affect only the results presented at Fig.10. One may conclude, thus, that in fact the fake rate provided by the TPR for the TRT and the SCT combined tracker even lower than presented one.

Fig.11 shows the fake track rate \((P_{T}>7GeV)\) and the efficiency to find true track as functions of minimum number of SCT hits required on the track for TP layout. Results are given for luminosity of \(L=2\cdot 10^{34}cm^{-2}s^{-1}\). If one requires more than \(4\div 5\) SCT hits on the reconstructed track, the fake track rate is at the level of about 10% of the real tracks from the pile-up, while the efficiency is better than 97%.

### The SCT stand-alone tracking

In the variant of the track recognition in the SCT stand-alone tracker the same as above two-step procedure was applied. This case, however, more complicated at first step because of rather small number of the layers in the SCT tracker. In ideal case a track can have only 11 hits for Panel layout and 10 hits for TP layout. A lot of fake candidates can be found which would have very many hits just from one layer of the SCT and thus mask the real one. Another kind of the cut, therefore, was introduced at first step of the procedure. It demands that hits accepted according to Eq.1 as a track candidate in \((r,\varphi)\)-plane belong to at least some minimal number of different layers, \(N_{i}\).

Fig.12 shows the fake track rate \((P_{T}>6GeV)\) and the efficiency to find true track as functions of minimum number of SCT hits required on the track for Panel layout. Results are given for two values of luminosity and two values of cut on minimal number of hitted layers, \(N_{i}\geq 4\) (circles) and \(N_{i}\geq 5\) (squares). Fake rate shows rather strong dependence on the value of this cut, while the efficiency depends only slightly. At the same time the level of the efficiency is lower than was obtained for the TPR in TRT stand-alone tracking and combined TRT + SCT one. Nevertheless it is higher than \(96\div 97\%\).

### Momentum and angle resolutions of the tracker

As a by-product of this study a performance of the tracker on the resolutions of transverse momentum, angle and the longitudinal position, \(Z\), of the track intercept with the beam line in different scenarios of tracking was obtained. Dependencies of these values on the luminosity for muons of \(P_{T}=20GeV\) within \(|\eta|<0.65\) are studied.

Transverse momentum resolution and azimuthal-angle resolution are shown at Fig.13. The stand-alone TRT resolution of \(P_{T}\) and \(\varphi\) shows a sensitivity to contributions of pile-up effects and slightly degrades with increasing of the luminosity. Much more high granularity of the SCT layers provides constant resolutions in wide range of the luminosity values. The SCT layout with stereo strips (TP layout) shows slightly better values of the resolutions in comparison with the crossed strips (Panel layout) variant.

The measurement accuracies of the polar angle, \(\theta\), and the longitudinal intercept, \(Z\), of the track are shown at Fig.14. One should note that these variables can be measured only with the SCT and therefore only two variants are presented, SCT in Panel layout (crossed strips) and SCT in TP layout (stereo strips). One may observe that the accuracies are unaffected by pile-up effects. The layout with crossed strips provides better resolutions for both of these variables as it can be expected.

Conclusion

The variant of the global pattern recognition is developed for the ATLAS inner tracker and applied to the DICE simulated data. Different scenarios of the tracking and different layouts of the inner tracker were tried as input. A flexibility of the approach was demonstrated.

This particular study has an impact on single track particle finding in conditions of the pile-up environment. It was shown that the efficiency for high \(P_{T}\) track reconstruction is high enough (\(\geq 97\div 99\%\)) up to the very large luminosity. The rate of fake tracks obtained as a result of random associations of hits is below of the expected rate of real tracks from the pile-up at not too high \(P_{T}\) (\(\leq 7\div 10GeV\)) even at luminosity twice high than the design one for the LHC.

The study can not be considered, however, as complete and conclusive. Some of the results were obtained not in the straight line with the proposed approach because of the computer memory limitations. Different layouts considered can not be compared directly in terms of the track recognition performance, because of differences in some of the parameters used. Much more work is needed to do a correct comparison of them. Electronic noise and inefficiences for the detecting elements of the SCT are not assumed, as they are not implemented in the DICE simulation. So, rather, this note can be considered as present status of the work.

Our plans for further work are the following:

- track recognition in jets for the barrel region of the tracker;

- tests of the track recognition in the end-cap region of the tracker;

- expansion of the package for the crack region.

The problem of the computer memory limitations should be solved for some of these tasks.
