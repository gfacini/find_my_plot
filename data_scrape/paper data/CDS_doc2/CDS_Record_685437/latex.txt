###### Abstract

The sensitivity of the ATLAS experiment for discovery of the Standard Model Higgs boson produced in vector boson fusion and decaying by \(H\to\tau^{+}\tau^{-}\to l\nu_{l}\nu_{\tau}+hX\) is studied at low luminosity. At least \(3\sigma\) signal significance over background can be achieved in the mass range 110-145 GeV with 30 fb\({}^{-1}\) at the LHC. This process can therefore be a significant complementary channel for the discovery of an intermediate mass Higgs boson.

Introduction

Discovery of a Standard Model or supersymmetric light Higgs boson, if it exists, will be possible at the LHC within the first two years of low-luminosity running, over the full mass range. High precision electroweak measurements and theoretical considerations lead to the expectation that the Higgs mass is close to the lower bound obtained from direct measurements : \(M_{H}\gtrsim 114.1\) GeV [1]. Unfortunately, it is precisely in the low mass range that detection of the Higgs is more difficult, and will rely on a combination of processes \(H\to\gamma\gamma\), \(H\to ZZ^{*}\to 4\ell\) and associated production \(t\bar{t}H\), with \(H\to b\bar{b}\). It is therefore important to complement these discovery channels with new signals.

At the LHC, the main process of Higgs production is gluon fusion, but the substantial QCD backgrounds make it difficult to take advantage of decay channels with large branching ratios such as \(H\to b\bar{b}\), or even \(H\to\tau\tau\). Higgs production by the weak boson fusion channel (WBF), \(qq\to qqVV\to qqH\), represents 10-20% of the total SM Higgs production rate in the intermediate mass range, but becomes more significant for higher Higgs masses. Previous studies [2] have shown that WBF allows detection of a heavy Higgs boson at the LHC. Recently, however, it was pointed out [3] that WBF can make an important contribution to the Higgs discovery, even for a low mass Higgs, where the production cross section for \(M_{H}\sim 110-150\) GeV is as high as a few pb.

A characteristic feature of weak boson fusion events is the presence of two accompanying quarks from which the \(W\)'s or \(Z\)'s have been radiated. These quarks give rise to hadronic jets which are observed in the forward and backward regions of the detector. Tagging of these forward jets serves as a very powerful background rejection tool. Another important experimental feature of the WBF signal is that, unlike many background processes, hadronic activity is suppressed in the region of low pseudorapidity because the emitted vector bosons are color-singlets.

In the present note, the observability in ATLAS of a SM intermediate mass Higgs, produced by WBF and decaying by the channel \(H\to\tau\tau\to\ell+\mbox{jets}+E_{T}^{\mbox{miss}}\) is evaluated. Simultaneously, another independant study of this channel has been peformed and will appear in a separate note [18]. An analysis of the complementary channel \(H\to\tau\tau\to\ell\nu\nu+\ell\nu\nu\) has been reported recently in [4]. The Higgs decay channel \(H\to\tau\tau\) has previously been studied [5] for a supersymmetric heavy Higgs, where it is strongly enhanced over a large region of parameter space, and where direct and associated \(b\bar{b}A\) production by gluon fusion is significant for large values of \(\tan\beta\). The process of SM Higgs production by WBF is found to be a promising channel for observation of a Higgs in the important mass range 110-150 GeV, confirming studies by Rainwater and _al._[3]. It will also offer the possibility for a direct measurement of the Yukawa coupling \(H\tau\bar{\tau}\).

## 2 Event Generation

This section describes the generation of signal and background events. The hard partonic interaction was evaluated using the CTEQ5L structure functions [6] for the colliding protons. The generators accounted for initial and final state interactions as well as full hadronization. The resolution and efficiency effects of the ATLAS detector were applied using ATLFAST 1.62 [7], the fast simulation program for the ATLAS detector, under conditions of low luminosity (\(\mathcal{L}=10^{33}\,cm^{-2}s^{-1}\)).

### Higgs Signal

The signal is described at lowest order by two Feynman diagrams, \(qq\to qq(WW,ZZ)\to qq\,H\), i.e. \(WW\) and \(ZZ\) fusion where the weak bosons are emitted from the incoming quarks (Figure 1).

A sample of 100000 signal events was produced with PYTHIA 6.152 [8] for several Higgs masses. However, the normalisation was obtained from the leading order generator VV 2H [9] with CTEQ5L parton distribution functions, using the more precise branching ratios calculated by HDECAY v3.0 [10]. Table 1 compares the LO (\(\sigma\times BR\)) obtained for several Higgs masses. The differences between the two generators are essentially due to the branching ratios of the Higgs decay. One should note that NLO calculations, which take into account QCD corrections, yield a cross section about 8-10% higher than the LO cross section.

The \(\tau\)'s were left to decay freely but events with one \(\tau\) decaying leptonically, \(\tau\to e\nu_{e}\,\nu_{\tau},\mu\nu_{\mu}\nu_{\tau}\), and the other hadronically were selected at the analysis level. The combined branching ratio of \(\tau\)-pair decay is 45%. The TAUOLA [11] decay library was used in order to account for the spin correlation between the two \(\tau\)'s and the resulting angular distribution of the decay products.

### Backgrounds

The main physics background for \(\tau^{+}\tau^{-}jj\) arises from QCD processes with one \(Z/\gamma\) and two jets in the final state. The principal "QCD Zjj" diagrams (figure 2) include the Drell-Yan process \(q\bar{q}\to(Z,\gamma)\to\tau^{+}\tau^{-}\), accompanied by initial state radiation:

\[q\bar{q}\to gg\tau^{+}\tau^{-} \tag{1}\]

and processes involving gluon splitting in the initial state:

\[qg\to qg\tau^{+}\tau^{-},\quad gg\to q\bar{q}\tau^{+}\tau^{-} \tag{2}\]

or quark scattering dominated by t-channel gluon exchange, with \(Z\) or \(\gamma\) bremsstrahlung:

\[qq^{\prime}\to qq^{\prime}\tau^{+}\tau^{-}, \tag{3}\]

Figure 2: Feynman Diagrams for the dominant QCD Zjj processes.

Matrix elements based on the work of [12] have been interfaced to PYTHIA [15] and have then been used to generate the QCD Zjj events. CTEQ5L structure functions were used with renormalization and factorization scales:

\[\mu_{\it{Fac}}^{2}=Q^{2}=\min\left(\Sigma p_{T}^{2}(jets),\,E_{T}^{2}(Z)\right) \tag{4}\]

Phase space integration, performed by VEGAS [13], assigns a weight to each event

\[wt=\frac{\sigma_{\it{event}}}{\sigma_{\it{max}}} \tag{5}\]

where \(\sigma_{\it{event}}\) is the contribution of the event to the total cross section and \(\sigma_{\it{max}}\) is arbitrarily chosen. Events are accepted with a probability \(wt\) if \(\sigma_{\it{event}}<\sigma_{\it{max}}\); otherwise, they are always accepted, but given a weight \(wt\). Since the fluctuations of these weights are very large, due to some possible infrared divergencies in some regions of phase space, the event generation must be performed carefully to avoid unphysical effects that overestimate the real contribution of these processes to the physical background. Figure 3 shows the distribution of the event weight \(wt\). Successive cuts during analysis leave only events with a low \(wt\) contributing to the final background and hence a preselection cut on a maximum value of \(wt\), could be used. Another way to avoid these divergences is the use of a cut on the invariant mass of the final state parton pair \(m_{\it{qq}}\), to avoid a collinear divergence in the parton splitting. Table 2 shows the cross sections obtained with these cuts.

One should note that QCD Z+jets processes are also available in PYTHIA, but they only include diagrams with one hard jet [14]:

\[q\overline{q}\to gZ\,\quad qg\to qZ \tag{6}\]

A second jet, if present, arises from initial state radiation and is softer than jets obtained from matrix element evaluation of the QCD Zjj process (Figure 4). In order to compare the two generators, a sample of events was also generated using PYTHIA, with CTEQ5L and \(\mu_{\it{Fac}}^{2}=Q^{2}=\vec{p}_{T}^{2}+\frac{1}{2}m_{Z}^{2}\).

An additional irreducible physics background, which will be called "EW Zjj" arises principally from \(Z\) or \(\gamma\) bremsstrahlung from primary quarks scattering by t-channel electroweak boson exchange, with \(Z,\gamma\rightarrow\tau^{+}\tau^{-}\) (Figure 5). This background includes electroweak boson fusion, \(VV\rightarrow\tau^{+}\tau^{-}\), either via \(t\)-channel \(\tau/\nu\)-exchange or via the triple gauge boson vertex. The latter has a momentum and color structure identical to the signal and cannot easily be suppressed by cuts. Matrix element calculations of all tree-level diagrams described in [3] have been interfaced as external processes to PYTHIA and then used to generate the EW Zjj events.

Figure 3: \(wt=\frac{\sigma_{exex}}{\sigma_{max}}\) distribution after sucessive cuts. Only events with low \(wt\) contribute to the final background.

Figure 5: Feynman diagrams of the dominant EW Zjj backgrounds.

Other reducible backgrounds, i.e. any process that has a hard, isolated lepton and missing \(p_{T}\), a hard, narrow \(\tau\)**-**like jet and two forward tagging jets, could affect the Higgs signal. Two particular processes have been considered:

* \(W\)+jets, where \(W\to l\nu_{l}\) with \(l=e,\mu\).
* \(t\overline{t}\to Wb\)\(Wb\), where one \(W\to l\nu_{l}\) (\(l=e,\mu\)) and the other \(W\to\)_all._

A light quark or a \(b\) jet could fake a hadronic \(\tau\) decay and tagging jets could come from either W decay or initial/final state radiation. PYTHIA 6.152 has also been used to generate all these processes. Table 3 summarizes Monte Carlo production of all the physics backgrounds.

## 3 Analysis

The \(Hjj\) signal is characterized by two forward jets and central \(\tau\) decay products. The basic acceptance requirements must ensure that one isolated lepton, one \(\tau\)-jet and at least

two tagging jets are observed inside the ATLAS detector and are well separated from each other.

### Experimental issues

The reconstruction of ordinary jets, \(\tau\)-tagged jets, and leptons is based on the ATLFAST [7] parametrized Monte Carlo with default values of the parameters. In particular, jets were reconstructed using a cone algorithm with a radius \(R=\sqrt{(\Delta\eta)^{2}+(\Delta\phi)^{2}}=0.4\) from clusters with \(E_{T}>\)10 GeV. Leptons were required to be isolated, meaning that their electromagnetic clusters in the calorimeter were separated from other clusters by \(\Delta R>\)0.4 and \(E_{T}>\)10 GeV in a cone of \(\Delta R=0.2\) around the lepton. An efficiency \(\varepsilon_{l}=0.9\) is assumed for lepton detection.

#### 3.1.1 Jet reconstruction and tagging

The tagging jets are searched for over the full ATLAS calorimeter coverage (\(|\eta|<4.9\)) and an energy calibration is applied to all jets to correct the jet energy back to that of the original parton. An additional correction is applied to take into account the efficiency of jet identification. This correction results from a full simulation of the performance of the ATLAS detector for jet reconstruction, including pile-up effects [16], which provides a parametrization of the ratio of the efficiency for jet reconstruction in full and fast simulation as a function of \(\mathrm{p}_{T}\) and \(\eta\). This correction rejects only 5% of the total signal events. The remaining jets are ordered in decreasing value of \(\mathrm{p}_{T}\) and the two jets with highest \(\mathrm{p}_{T}\) are taken as the candidate tagging jets.

#### 3.1.2 \(\tau\) identification

Identification of the \(\tau\) hadronic decay mode among the large number of produced jets is crucial in order to achieve the best sensitivity for the Higgs signal. This sensitivity depends strongly on the acceptable \(\tau\)-jet rejection in the ATLAS detector. A systematic study [5, 17] has shown that a hadronic jet with \(E_{T}>40\) GeV and \(|\eta|<2.5\) can be identified as a \(\tau\)-jet if it satisfies the following criteria:

* \(R_{em}<0.07\), where \(R_{em}\) is the jet radius obtained from the cells of the electromagnetic calorimeter belonging to the jet;
* \(\Delta E_{T}^{12}<0.1\), where \(\Delta E_{T}^{12}\) is the difference between energies in cones of size \(\Delta R=0.1\) and 0.2, normalized to the total jet transverse energy * \(N_{tr}=1\), where \(N_{tr}\) is the number of reconstructed tracks with \(p_{T}>2\) GeV pointing to the cluster.

The above set of criteria leads to an efficiency \(\varepsilon_{\tau}=0.26\). However, in the present analysis, it was verified that we do not need a very high non-\(\tau\) rejection because fake \(\tau\)'s come mainly from reducible W+jets and \(t\overline{t}\) backgrounds. ATLFAST-b accounts for mis-tagging of \(\tau\)-jets by providing a fake \(\tau\)-jet probability during reconstruction, given an efficiency \(\varepsilon_{\tau}\). This mistagging probability is applied to all jets of the event and the ones labeled as \(\tau\)-jets are also passed to the mass reconstruction routines. The rate of events from \(t\overline{t}\) increases by a factor of 5-7, depending on the mass window considered, when \(\varepsilon_{\tau}\) varies in the range \(0.26-0.50\). An efficiency \(\varepsilon_{\tau}=0.50\) has been used for this analysis allowing higher statistics for signal and backgrounds events. The average rejection factor for non-\(\tau\) jets is, in this case, \(\sim 100\). Above an efficiency of 50%, it was verified that the overall significance does not significantly improve, when all cuts are applied, because of the increase in the rate of fake \(\tau\)-jets from the above backgrounds. The choice of this efficiency, with its associated rejection factor is discussed in the considerations of systematic errors, in Sect. 4.

The energy calibration of \(\tau\)-jets is obtained with the same calibration constants as for other hadronic jets [17]. This method overestimates the \(\tau\)-jet energy, particularly for low \(p_{T}\) jets, by \(\sim 5\%\). However, it has been shown for \(H/A\to\tau\tau\), for example, that the precision on the \(\tau\)-jet energy reconstruction will not affect significantly [17] the final result. It will shift the reconstructed \(\tau\)-pair mass both for the signal and for the background \(Z\to\tau\tau\) peak. Ultimately, energy calibration will be very important for a precise determination of the Higgs mass.

#### 3.1.3 Jet Veto Efficiencies

A veto against jets in the central region is an important tool to suppress QCD and \(t\overline{t}\) backgrounds. However, pile-up events at the LHC can also produce fake jets in the central region. A full simulation in [16] of these effects has shown that fake jets can be kept at a low level provided that a \(\mathrm{p}_{T}\) threshold of 20 GeV is used for jet identification. This study has produced a parametrization of the probability of having a fake jet, given a \(\mathrm{p}_{T}\) threshold and an interval of pseudorapidity. This probability is used, in addition with the central jets produced in the process, to check if the event passes the central jet veto cut. About 6% of the signal events are rejected because of these expected fake central jets when using \(\mathrm{p}_{T}^{ veto}>\) 20 GeV.

### Basic event selection

The selection for the \(H\to\tau^{+}\tau^{-}\to l\nu_{t}\,\nu_{\tau}+hX\) signal in WBF is based on cuts proposed in [3]. They were optimized, however, to ensure maximum acceptance with respect to the ATLAS detector performance for a \(\mathrm{m}_{H}\sim 120\) GeV Higgs boson.

A preselection was first applied, requiring one isolated lepton, as defined in Sect. 3.1, two or more hadronic jets and one identified \(\tau\)-jet. These preliminary cuts are very effective against processes which do not produce many real \(\tau\)'s such as \(t\overline{t}\) and \(\mathrm{W}+\)jets.

#### 3.2.1 Lepton trigger and cuts on \(\tau\)-jets

First, the trigger requirement implies a minimum \(p_{T}\) on the lepton from \(\tau\)-decay (figure 6):

\[p_{T}^{e}>25\;\mathrm{GeV}\;\mathrm{or}\;\;p_{T}^{\mu}>\,20\;\mathrm{GeV}\]

If the trigger thresholds could be lowered, some signal could be recovered.

The identification of hadronic \(\tau\) decay requires significant transverse momentum of the jet. It has been shown in [17] that the following cut:

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:12]

Forward jets tagging cuts were imposed in the \(m_{jj}\) plot. All distributions are normalized to unity. The backgrounds \(W\)+jets and \(t\overline{t}\) are not shown in (d) as they are not significant in the mass window of interest, after these cuts.

### Further event selection criteria

#### 3.3.1 \(\tau\)-pair mass reconstruction

Reconstruction of the Higgs mass requires good \(\tau\)-pair invariant mass reconstruction from the observable \(\tau\) decay products and the missing transverse momentum of the event. In the approximation that the neutrinos from the \(\tau\) decays are collinear with the charged observables (Figure 8), the conservation of the total transverse momentum leads to:

\[(\vec{p}_{T}^{\tau_{1}}+\vec{p}_{T}^{\tau_{2}})=\frac{\vec{p}_{T}^{\,\,\prime} }{x_{l}}+\frac{\vec{p}_{T}^{\,\,h}}{x_{h}}=\vec{p}_{T}^{\,\,\prime}+\vec{p}_{T }^{\,\,h}+\vec{\not{h}}_{T}. \tag{7}\]

where \(x_{l}\) and \(x_{h}\) are the fractions of the parent \(\tau\) moment a carried by the lepton (for the \(\tau\) decaying leptonically) and by the tau-jet (for the \(\tau\) decaying hadronically). As long as these particles are not back-to-back, Eq. 7 gives two conditions for \(x_{l,h}\) and provides the \(\tau\) momenta. Once \(x_{l,h}\) are calculated, the \(\tau-\tau\) invariant mass, with the approximation that \(\tau^{\prime}s\) are massless, is given by:

\[m_{\tau^{+}\tau-}^{\,2}\approx\frac{2p_{l}\cdot p_{h}}{x_{l}x_{h}} \tag{8}\]

In some cases, detector effects lead to unphysical solutions for the reconstructed momenta: about 8% of the reconstructed \(\tau\)'s from a 120 GeV Higgs boson signal have an \(x_{i}<0\). In order to avoid these, a cut on the angle between the \(\tau\) decay products and on the calculated \(x_{i}\) is applied:

\(\tau\)**-decay products cut:**\(\cos\theta_{lh}>-0.9,\,\,\,\,\,\,x_{l,h}>0\).

Figure 8: Sketch showing the \(\tau-\tau\) invariant mass reconstruction in the “collinear approximation”.

#### 3.3.2 Background rejection cuts

For real \(\tau\) pair events, the resultant missing momentum from the presence of neutrinos can be significant. In the \(t\overline{t}\) and W+jets reducible backgrounds, fake \(\tau\)-jets and leptons from W decay give unphysical solutions with \(x>1\) since the assumption of collinearity of missing momentum with the lepton and jet is not valid. It is also noticed that the \(x_{l}\) distribution is softer for the real \(\tau\)'s than for the reducible backgrounds because the charged lepton shares the parent \(\tau\) energy with two \(\nu\)'s. Requiring:

\(\tau\)**-reconstruction cut:**\(x_{l}<0.75,\;\;\;x_{h}<1\)

is very effective in rejecting the W+jets and \(t\overline{t}\) reducible backgrounds (figure 9).

At this point, an important fraction of the \(t\overline{t}\) and W+jets reducible backgrounds has been rejected with the \(\Delta\eta\) cut and the requirement on the \(\tau\) reconstruction cut (Table 4). The remaining events are severely suppressed by a cut on \(m_{T}\), the transverse mass calculated from the lepton transverse momentum and the missing \(p\!\!\!/_{T}\). For signal events, this transverse mass distribution reflects the mass of the \(\tau\) and peaks at low values, but displays a wide tail at higher values since the transverse missing momentum includes a contribution from the neutrinos of the two \(\tau\) decays. Requiring:

\(m_{T}\) **cut:**\(m_{T}(l,p\!\!\!/_{T})=\sqrt{(|p_{T}(\ell)|+|p\!\!\!/_{T}|)^{2}-|\vec{p}_{\ell}+ \vec{p}\!\!\!/_{T}|^{2}}<30\) GeV

rejects most of processes involving a W boson, for which the Jacobian peak of the \(m_{T}\) distribution lies much higher (Figure 10). What remains from the \(t\overline{t}\) and W+jets processes after this cut in the mass window of the Higgs is negligible. On the other hand, the QCD Zjj background typically occurs at small invariant masses, since real \(\tau^{\prime}s\) are involved.

The presence of neutrinos in the final state implies a significant missing \(p_{T}\) in the topology of the events. For low values of \(p_{T}^{miss}\), the \(\tau\)'s are essentially back-to-back, making it difficult to reconstruct the \(\tau\)-pair mass (equation 7). The following cut:

\(p_{T}^{miss}\) **cut:**\(p_{T}^{miss}>30\) GeV

is efficient for reducing the Z tail from QCD and EW Zjj backgrounds and hence will improve the signal significance [18].

Further reduction of backgrounds could then be obtained by imposing a cut on the invariant mass of the tagging jets:

\(m_{jj}\) **cut:**\(m_{jj}>700\) GeV

This cut is justified in Figure 7-d, where the \(m_{jj}\) distribution for the WBF Higgs signal and the dominant backgrounds processes are shown.

Because of the absence of color exchange between the two scattered quarks in EW processes, soft gluon emissions occur mainly in the very forward and backward regions. However, QCD processes are dominated by \(t-\)channel color octet exchange which results in soft gluon radiation mainly in the central region of the detector. A veto on these central jets:

\[\mbox{\bf Jet veto cut:}\hskip 56.905512ptp_{Tj}^{\mbox{\scriptsize\it veto }}>20\;\mbox{GeV},\hskip 10.0pt\eta_{j,min}^{\mbox{\scriptsize\it tag}}+0.7<\eta_{j}^{ \mbox{\scriptsize\it veto}}<\eta_{j,max}^{\mbox{\scriptsize\it tag}}-0.7,\]

rejects QCD processes where color exchange produces jets in the central region of the detector. It therefore improves the signal-to-background ratio. It must be noted, however, that this cut is very dependent on the detector resolution and pile-up effects.

## 4 Results

The reconstructed \(\tau\)-pair invariant mass for the signal and backgrounds after all the cuts is shown in Figure 11, taking the cut \(m_{qq}>500\) GeV for the QCD Zjj background. The resolution in mass of the reconstructed Higgs resonance, as well as of the \(Z\) peak is \(\sim 10\) GeV, with an energy offset of \(\sim 2\) GeV.

The QCD \(Zjj\) peak and tail regions consist essentially of true \(Z\rightarrow\tau\tau\) events, with only \(\sim 5\%\) of events comprising fake \(\tau\) jets. The small \(t\overline{t}\) background, however, consists of \(\sim 80\%\) events with fake \(\tau\) jets.

The effects of the different cuts discussed in the present note, taking a \(\tau\)-jet efficiency \(\varepsilon_{\tau}=0.50\), are summarized in Table 4, in which the very small contribution from the Higgs production by the gluon-gluon fusion process is also indicated. Table 5 gives particular attention to the dominant QCD Zjj background which has been produced with different Monte Carlo generators. The differences under the different cases of \(wt\) or \(m_{qq}\) cuts are due to rare events which remain with a large weight. Mass bins of \([M_{H}-10,M_{H}+15]\) GeV have been chosen for analyzing the cross sections, considering the \(\tau-\)pair resolution and the distribution in the tail of the Z peak in the background events.

A number of systematic effects need to be considered.

* the uncertainties due to the fluctuating weights in the QCD Zjj matrix element generator are estimated at \(\sim 0.03\) fb in the background. This is obtained from the scatter of the background cross section around the mean, in Table 4.
* uncertainties arise in the simulation of the level of the backgrounds. QCD Zjj events produced with M.E. calculations yield a higher contribution, by at least a factor of two relative to PYTHIA, to the final number of background events. The matrix element generator is expected to be more reliable, since it accounts for subprocesseswith two hard jets in the final state, rather than softer jets produced in leading log approximation by the parton shower in PYTHIA. NLO calculations of Higgs production would yield a cross section higher by 10% than LO calculations [9]. Recent results [19] show that NLO corrections would also contribute \(\sim 10\%\) to the QCD Z+jj cross section.
* the tail of the QCD Zjj background needs to be well understood. The fast simulation gives only an approximation. It has been verified that, apart from the \(t\bar{t}\) contribution, background events in the Higgs mass region are due essentially to events originating from \(Z\to\tau\tau\) with only 2% contribution from fake \(\tau\)'s. A variation of the cuts in real data can help confirm the level of expected background and tail. The shape of the tail could also be measured with some precision by considering the Drell-Yan process \(q\vec{q}\to Z\to\tau\tau\).
* uncertainties in detector performance, such as \(\tau\)-jet and lepton reconstruction efficiencies and rejection factors. For example, requiring an efficiency of 75% would lead to an increase, in the final analysis, of the \(t\bar{t}\) background by a factor 8, while the signal and tail of the \(Zjj\) backgrounds would increase by 50%. The net significance of the signal would not be much affected, but the systematic error from background estimation would be larger. In particular, the \(Zjj\) tail would mix with the \(t\bar{t}\) background making background subtraction difficult.
* other systematic errors relating to calibration, pileup effects, luminosity measurement,

detector for the signal and backgrounds, i.e. QCD+EW Zjj and \(t\bar{t}\), is shown. Poisson and Gaussian significances of the signal are shown as well. The Poisson significance is calculated as the equivalent number of standard deviations from a normal distribution, given the Poisson probability of observing \(N_{S}+N_{B}\) events when \(N_{B}\) events are expected from the background. Figure 12 shows the mass dependence of the signal significance with two estimations of the dominant QCD Z+jets background. As expected, PYTHIA gives a more optimistic significance because it doesn't include all QCD diagrams for the Z+jets process. The Higgs signal in the mass range 115-140 GeV is observable with 5 \(\sigma\) significance with 40 fb\({}^{-1}\) to 60 fb\({}^{-1}\) integrated luminosity at the LHC.

## 5 Conclusions

The discovery potential for a Standard Model Higgs boson in the 110-150 Gev mass range has been studied using the vector boson fusion production process, and with \(H\to\tau^{+}\tau^{-}\) decay mode. Semileptonic decay of the \(\tau\) pair will be observable with a high significance in the mass window 110-140 GeV. Higher masses will require longer running periods at low luminosity, up to 60 fb\({}^{-1}\) to achieve a better significance because of the diminishing branching ratio of this decay mode.

In addition, these results could be combined with the double leptonic decay of the \(\tau\) pair [4] to obtain higher statistics for WBF production of the SM Higgs, allowing a measurement of the Yukawa coupling of \(\tau\)'s.
