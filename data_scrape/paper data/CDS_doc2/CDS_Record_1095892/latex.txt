###### Abstract

The present study analyses knowledge creation, acquisition and transfer in the five LHC physics experiments at CERN: ALICE, ATLAS, CMS, LHCb, and TOTEM.

A questionnaire was provided during collaboration meetings and a total of 291 replies were obtained and analysed.

The results of this research study provide evidence that the social process of participation in meetings, acquisition of skills in different areas, and the development of interests by interaction with colleagues are key elements of the learning process. Furthermore, the results indicate that knowledge acquisition in a multicultural environment plays a mediating role in the interaction between social capital constructs (social interaction, relationship quality, and network ties) and competitive advantage outcomes (invention development and technological distinctiveness). Social interaction, relationship quality, and network ties are connected to greater knowledge acquisition, and also contribute to innovation and transfer of the knowledge to industry.

The fertile environment of the five LHC experiments building and managing multiple processes, involves a dynamic, interactive, and simultaneous exchange of knowledge both inside and outside their organization.

Introduction

The purpose of scientific research, in general, is to find the laws to describe nature. It is pursued with the purpose of understanding phenomena and explaining the world in which we live. To understand phenomena, the comprehension of the scientific process is important, but in doing that to satisfy our needs, the technological process is essential. More and more often society asks physicists to explain what advantages society has gained from their research and which outcomes can be expected.

There are mainly three types of direct benefit to technology and society from physics research: first, entirely new fields of technology may be created and second, the pioneering technology created may solve technical or social problems. Thanks to the introduction of new scientific instruments, it is possible to improve knowledge acquisition as suggested by this study. This yields the third type of benefit, which is the most important: the transfer of acquired knowledge that may generate new innovation in many different fields. The lack of interaction among scientists and industry is the fundamental problem for science and technology transfer. It stems from a disparity of intent; between what is conceived to be the final goal of science on the one hand and the applicability of technology on the other.

Knowledge creation has become an interesting and relevant research topic for the impact it has for innovation and creation of new ideas. Big Science organizations such as CERN are a good place for such kinds of investigations as they train every year thousands of new researchers who constitute qualified people well trained both for academia and industry. The knowledge spillovers from fundamental science are also a source of beneficial outcome for the economy and for society. CERN also represents a good place to investigate how knowledge is created, acquired, and transferred by:

* providing and improving an introduction to other knowledge bases;
* expanding opportunities for the development of knowledge;
* improving competences;
* integrating skills and competences;providing and facilitating a variety of interactions possibly leading to technological innovation.

The knowledge acquired inside the organization catalyses and amplifies the knowledge created by individuals and is embedded at the group level through dialogue, discussion, experience sharing, and observation. It is a continuous and dynamic interaction between tacit and explicit knowledge, thanks to which innovations emerge. The nature of knowledge is represented by the individual's value system. This is a fundamental basis for explaining how innovation is realized. Furthermore, social interaction is built up according to the intensity, frequency, and breadth of information exchanged.

Stronger social interaction provides scientists and engineers with an insight into the specialized systems and structures of CERN and results in specialized information, language, and know-how. By intensifying the frequency, breadth, and depth of information exchange, social interaction increases relation-specific common knowledge especially in Big Science collaborations such as the CERN LHC experiments. Such diversity is necessary for new knowledge creation; it exposes the users to a greater range of knowledge acquisition opportunities and enhances the users' ability to value such opportunities. Common knowledge is required for learning to occur between two exchange partners; however, some diversity of knowledge is necessary for the transfer of new knowledge to occur. Indeed, exposure to many different external contacts is essential for learning in a competitive environment. The importance of social capital for technological distinctiveness and the input of the diversity and frequency of interactions in the innovation process have recently been assessed [Autio et al. 2003].

We now live in a 'Knowledge Society' [Drucker 1993], and in contrast to our former industrial society, where knowledge used to be just a resource, today _knowledge is the key factor_ in innovation.

The educational impact of an intergovernmentally funded scientific centre such as CERN has been assessed in previous studies [Bressan 2004, Camporesi 1996]. These studies attempted to evaluate what competitive knowledge and core skills people develop and to determine the market value of their skills for CERN Member States' industries.

For this purpose a knowledge creation, acquisition, and transfer framework model was created and verified.

The present study based on the five LHC experiments makes a detailed analysis of knowledge creation in the technological process as described by the model proposed in Fig. 1.1 [Bressan 2004].

Knowledge is created and expanded in a dynamic _human_ process through _social interaction_, being converted through four different modes - socialization, externalization, combination, and internalization.

By introducing knowledge management concepts to science, this model helps to reduce the gap between the scientific and the technological worlds. These concepts have so far been limited to companies and information technology. The model also explains how technology transfer is closely related to and continuously fuelled by knowledge transfer. However, knowledge is highly related to an individual and organizational context and the tools available. Individuals are the key recipients when it comes to transferring, decoding, and utilizing existing knowledge. From individual perception, assessment, and analysis of context and tools in which the five LHC experiments evolved, it has been possible to track the various aspects of knowledge acquisition and

Fig. 1.1: The knowledge creation, acquisition, and transfer model.

transfer. Furthermore, routines and tools which are the media used to transfer knowledge have also been analysed by the present study.

In a quantitative and comparative assessment of the knowledge acquired by physicists and engineers who have worked at CERN, we have investigated how one's nationality, and therefore different academic curricula and cultural differences can affect knowledge perception, learning, and acquisition [Huuse and Nordahl 2004, da Cruz et al. 2004]. Furthermore, the environmental and multicultural aspects and interactions generated by a Big Science organization with scientific aims and high technological distinctiveness have been investigated among individuals sharing a strong common scientific identity. The study also aims at bridging the gap that exists between the industrial and scientific world, in the field of knowledge management. The study confirms, with quantitative data, and conceptualizes the role CERN has played over the past 50 years as a leading organization in creating knowledge, not only in the field of HEP but also in related technological fields. It also makes explicit the importance for individual and organizational knowledge creation in a multicultural scientific and technological environment. Many students, scientists, and engineers are embedded in a scientific atmosphere and are given the opportunity to confront and to interact with a vast array of technical and scientific specialists. CERN as an organization has its own epistemology, with its own tacit and explicit knowledge and creating entities (individuals, groups, and their organization).

At CERN, however, technology makes available to European physicists installations whose cost would be prohibitive for a single nation. Installations or equipment that are, at CERN, using cutting-edge technologies in many fields, from special materials to electronics, data acquisition and analysis.

The present project continues from the detailed analysis of knowledge creation in the technological process as described by the model proposed [Bressan 2004] to investigate the interaction patterns established in the five LHC experiments that lead to innovative product development, and the appropriate language and level of communication to manage huge endeavours in which more than 5000 physicists and technicians from all over the world participate.

A large part of the transfer of technology from CERN comes through the transfer of people's knowledge or know-how. Within CERN, and the institutes collaborating in the CERN physics programme, experts are needed in many fields of technology to perform the core business of fundamental research. This expertise is being continuously transferred to industry and external institutions in a number of ways through people. A study has shown that of the young researchers, who participated in two of CERN's LEP experiments some 40% from DELPHI, and about 46% from OPAL have gone to work in industry [Camporesi 1996, OPAL 2003].

Each year hundreds of young people join CERN as students, fellows, associates, or staff members on first employment. In summary, the continuous flow of people who come to CERN, who are trained by working with CERN's experts, and who then return to their home countries is a useful example of technology and knowledge transfer (TT & KT) through people. Experience shows that industry, universities, and other private and public employers value highly these people and the on-the-job training they receive at CERN [Bressan and Streit-Bianchi 2005, OPAL 2003].

The interface between the industrial and public research domains is multifaceted, and different research institutions may possess distinctive potentials for the knowledge creation for economic purposes. We hope that the analysis reported here will trigger further inquiries into the corollary learning and innovation impact of CERN and Big Science centres in innovation systems.

Previous research demonstrated that the potential of Big Science centres may well be currently under-utilized in industry [Autio et al. 2003]. Specifically, paying more explicit attention to technological learning could enhance the spectrum of technological impact. Economic returns have been monitored simply on industrial return to member countries. The total economic benefit resulting from technological learning in industry greatly outweighs this aspect [Autio et al. 2003, Nordberg 1997, Bianchi-Streit et al. 1984, and Schmied 1975]. It is to be noted that in LHC experiments almost 50% of the participants are not from CERN Member States. This means that spillovers of technological learning are worldwide.

## 2 Material and methods

The focus of the survey was on CERN-related learning, organizational, and other benefits. The survey questionnaire (Appendix) was designed according to normal survey practice and built up on experience based on previous questionnaires [2, 3, 4]. Multi-item scales were used to measure both predictor and outcome variables, and the scales were derived from previously validated scales whenever possible. When CERN-specific scales were developed, this was done by paying attention to pertinent theoretical frameworks and research questions [2, 3]. All scales were pre-tested in test interviews, and the feedback from these was used to iron out any inconsistencies and potential misunderstandings. A detailed analysis of the answers was used to finalize the questionnaire and make statistical analysis easier. However, after having collected the questionnaire from the ATLAS Collaboration, it was realized that information such as age and status was missing and this was added to the questionnaires for the ALICE, CMS, LHCb and TOTEM collaborations. In addition, question 9 was not clear enough, as illustrated by the various comments received, and had to be reformulated.

Descriptive statistical analysis, logistic regression, and multiple (OLS) regression analysis were employed as the primary statistical analysis methods to analyse the survey data. Colinearity was not a significant problem as proven by OLS regressions. The internal reliability coefficient of this scale was measured using Cronbach's \(a\) on a scale from 0 to 1. High value would suggest a high degree of internal reliability for the scale. We also employed a Likert-style scale to measure various parameters, with the scale ranging from 1 (disagree) to 7 (agree). This same scale was used for all outcome variables.

As a final step of our analysis, we examined bivariate correlations between relationship outcome variables and their predictors. We also examined how the various outcomes are related to one another. Finally, we examined what drives the creation of relation-specific assets that smoothes the relationship management as well as various aspects related to internal communication procedures. A high degree of inter-correlationbetween outcome variables was also looked at. Analysis was made both at single collaboration level and with all experiments confounded.

The questionnaires were distributed during collaboration meetings and accompanied by a covering letter. The respondents were informed of the aim of the study and that the questionnaire was kept anonymous. The questionnaires were also made available at the collaboration secretariats and in CMS, also advertised in the CMS newsletter. The ATLAS management was able to obtain a good response by the end of a collaboration meeting in Paris in November 2005. For the other experiments, individual contacts were necessary by going in offices to meet members of the collaboration during 2006. This was done in order to achieve a reasonable number of replies. Not all the questions were completed. This has been taken into account in the analysis. It explains why the number of answers does not always add up to the total number of questionnaires received.

The total number of questionnaires returned for the five LHC experiments is summarized in Table 1.

Although the total number of questionnaires returned from ATLAS doubles that of ALICE, CMS, and LHCb, the responses did not differ significantly. When the distributions between respondents participating in different experiments were compared with a \(\chi^{2}\) test, no statistically significant difference between the distributions was observed. The data from the questionnaires were reported in Excel tables and the analysis of data was done after all the questionnaires had been collected using SPSS version 12.0.2 and analysing merged and individual collaboration data.

The sample of replies obtained represents a good cross-section of project managers, scientists, professors, and students participating in the collaborations.

\end{table}
Table 1: Number of questionnaires returned for the five LHC Experiments.

The design of the questionnaire

The questionnaire was structured to determine what the respondents have learned from their experience at CERN in terms of acquired knowledge and know-how and how this has been transferred inside the groups and entire collaboration. Some questions have two scale items, one determining the frequency and the other determining the value attributed to the specific questions.

### The structure of the questionnaire

The first part of the questionnaire is dedicated to personal information, asking for a description of the current position held by the respondents, as well as the position held while at CERN. The questionnaire then asks for specific information on scientific and technical functions and expertise, reasons for joining the collaboration, and technological developments performed (questions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5).

Communication and documentation barriers and enablers, and their impact in terms of efficiency and innovation are also assessed (questions 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11). The project network and management is addressed by questions 12, 13 and 14 whilst the importance of knowledge and industrial transfer is sought by questions 15, 16, 17 and 18.

The project was designed to answer the following research questions:

1. "What are the outcomes and dimensions of the knowledge transfer process in the LHC experiments?"
2. "To what extent does the scientific organizational and communication structure facilitate the knowledge transfer, technological outcomes and innovation?"

Other important aspects analysed are:

* The organizational and personal dimensions of knowledge transfer within each experiment and its sub-units and whether differences between the various experiments due to their size or interactions mechanisms allow for knowledge sharing.
* Whether the organizational structure takes into account mechanisms of knowledge transfer and innovation.
* Whether knowledge transfer depends on the domain of expertise, size of the collaboration, type of structure put in place, etc.

General analysis

To identify the outcomes, a similar approach to that used for projects aimed at technology transfer was used [Hause and Nordahl 2004]. This has been challenging as different individuals may perceive them in a different way according to their role in the collaboration.

The number of individuals working on each experiment varies across the different participating organizations and institutes; so does the working time of each individual.

The number of institutes per experiment and the number of countries represented is reported in Table 3.1. The ATLAS Collaboration has about 1700 members, CMS 2000, whereas ALICE has around 1000 collaborators and LHCb around 650. TOTEM is the smallest collaboration, equivalent to 3% of the largest collaboration.

The nationality distribution of the respondents is reported in Fig. 3.1. A total of 36 nationalities was represented in the sample. Physicists represent 75% of the respondents, whereas engineers and computer scientists account for 16% and 9%, respectively.

The sample of responses is truly representative of the collaborations and of its multicultural nature. The effect of the multicultural factors on the collaborations has also been assessed and analysed according to elements specific for the studied framework.

The demographic distribution of the LHC experiment project members is reported in Fig. 3.2. The maximum age of respondents was 71 years and the youngest was 21. It is interesting to note that the age range below 40 years is well represented in the respondent sample.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{l c c c c c} \hline \hline  & **ATLAS** & **CMS** & **ALICE** & **LHCb** & **TOTEM** \\ \hline Number of Institutes & 159 & 182 & 94 & 48 & 11 \\ \hline Number of Countries & 37 & 38 & 28 & 13 & 8 \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}

Table 3.2 reports the status distribution of personnel in ALICE, CMS, LHCb and TOTEM Collaborations. This information was not asked for from the ATLAS experiment. Table 3.3 considers the domain of expertise and function covered by the respondents in the five LHC experiments. Multiple replies were given for the domain of expertise and function by the respondents in most of the 291 questionnaires. Thirty-two per cent have managerial or coordination functions.

The working place where the respondents were spending more than 50% of their time is CERN for half of the sample, and universities all over the world for the other half. This means that a large fraction of university personnel is spending a large part of their time at CERN. More than 45% of the respondents spend 100% of their working time in the LHC experiments, as illustrated by Fig. 3.3.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{c c c c} \hline \hline
**Student** & **Ph.D. / Fellow** & **Assistant** & **Professor** & **CERN Staff** \\ \hline
17 & 53 & 24 & 46 & 30 \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 3.2: Status of respondents from ALICE, CMS, LHCb, TOTEM Collaborations.

Before joining the LHC project, 55% of the respondents had worked in some previous CERN collaboration (LEP, SPS, PS, ISOLDE, etc.), 44% worked in physics collaborations outside of CERN, 16% had previous work experience in physics. Multiple replies were given to these questions.

The analysis was done by considering and weighting each question by the total number of respondents (R) and the missing replies (M).

The institute and individual motivation for joining the LHC project (questions 1 and 2) is reported in Table 3.4. The respondents were asked to respond using a scale from 1 (disagreement) to 7 (agreement). The institute and the personal motivation show a very similar distribution with the technological motivation being more spread. This suggests that more importance is given to the scientific interest. About 10% of respondents consider the technological challenge as not being important.

As expected, owing to the size of the experiments and challenges represented by managing such big collaborations, about half of the respondents to question 3 consider, as indicated in Table 3.5, that the learning in terms of management and functioning of large

Figure 3.3: Percentage of working hours spent during 2005 – 2006 in the LHC experiments (100% = full time).

collaborations will have a positive impact on their future careers. Because of the impact of the Grid on the analysis of the LHC data, Information Technology was indicated as a positive learning factor by 21% of the collaboration members.

Do scientists move towards innovation with practical applications? This issue has been addressed directly or indirectly by questions 5, 14, and 17. The results are reported in Tables 3.5 and 3.6 and will be more thoroughly discussed in Section 4.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{l c} \hline \hline
**Domain of technological learning** & **Frequency** \\

\end{table}
Table 3.5: Domain of technological learning useful for the career.

As illustrated by Table 3.7 (question 4), the percentage of people that are thinking of starting an industrial company is about 6%. Seventy per cent of them are under 40 years of age and 80 % of them are physicists. Of those who consider going to work for a company, about half are below the age of 55. The percentage of respondents that are considering remaining in Academia is high (72%), as expected. Sixty-five per cent of the respondents consider that the development within the LHC experiments can be useful and applied in fields outside HEP, and 55% believe to have contributed to the developments of innovative technologies. This high percentage reflects a trend towards entrepreneurship and technology transfer which has been recently confirmed in a survey carried out at CERN in 2006 [Sessano, 2007].

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{l c} \hline \hline
**Craver development** & **Percentage** \\ \hline Start a company & 6 \\ Go to work for a company & 19 \\ Continue (or start in academia) & 72 \\ No reply & 3 \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}

\end{table}
Table 3.6: Innovative developments within the LHC experiments per domain.

These developments have been categorized as reported in Table 3.6 (question 5). Computing, detector technology, and electronics represent 33%, 40% and 25% of the reported innovation, respectively.

Communication in Big Science collaborations is of paramount importance especially considering the worldwide distribution of the collaboration members.

The respondents in question 6 were asked to evaluate both the importance and frequency of tools used to communicate as well as to estimate the value of importance they give to communication, on a scale from 1 (low) to 7 (high). The results obtained are reported in Table 3.8a and 3.8b, respectively. For the Likert scale, Cronebach's \(\alpha\) calculated value is 0.74.

* media and communication (statements: 1, 2, 3, 4)
* technological activity (statements: 11, 12, 13, 14)
* research activity (statements: 7, 8, 9, 10, 15)
* reading (statements: 18, 19, 20)
* formal meeting (statements: 5, 6)
* informal meeting (statements: 16, 17)
* training (statements: 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26).

These seven factors represent 68% of the total variance of all the items. For the Likert scale, Cronebach's \(\alpha\) calculated value is 0.91.

Question 8 refers to tools that could have made the project runs in a more efficient way. Twenty-seven per cent of respondents would have liked to have had more technical development meetings at CERN or in their home Institute, whereas the collaboration meetings have been assessed to be fully sufficient with fewer than 10% requesting more of these meetings. More than 25% would have liked to have had more informal meetings. A high percentage of people (60%) considered the project to be not efficient enough in terms of project documentation. Sixty per cent of them would have liked the documentation to be disseminated more frequently within the collaboration. The telephone, video and email were considered to be used sufficiently. Only 4% of respondents did not reply to this question.

Question 9 refers to the type of documentation that was to be produced in a large amount by the collaboration. The technical documentation and information provided by the participating members of the group was considered to be not sufficiently often (48% and 40%, respectively). It is interesting to note that 5% only did not reply to questions related to the experiment documentation whereas for information to the public and the records of individual contribution the amount of missing responses was 43%. This suggests that Outreach and public communication is not yet considered important by the collaboration members.

The information and documentation for members within the collaboration and to people outside the collaboration was addressed in question 10. Only 3% did not answer this question. Seventeen and a half per cent of respondents consider themselves to be poorly informed about the development of the project; 10% of them are students. Forty-nine per cent of the respondents consider that writing project documentation takes too much time. This reply is contradictory to the earlier assertion (question 8) that the respondents would have liked to have had more technical documentation. This could reflect the recognized importance of good project documentation but dislike of the amount of work it takes to achieve it. Only 15% of respondents complained of lack of information flow on the project development. It is interesting also to notice that, in spite of a good sharing of information within the participating institutions, 17% complain that R&D results are not shared with other LHC experiments.

The various aspects of networking within the collaboration are addressed by question 11, a question not answered by 2% of the respondents. To this question about 20% replied that it is difficult to find the right person to solve work-related problems; meaning that not enough effort is put in by the collaboration to inform about the available respective specific competences.

Good communication exists with persons within or outside sub-projects in each experiment. Eight-six per cent benefits from the expertise of other people. Furthermore 48% of respondents benefits from the expertise of people working on other LHC experiments. For the Likert scale, Cronebach's \(\alpha\) calculated value is 0.78.

The multicultural environment on which the LHC experiments are building was addressed by question 12. This question was not replied to by 2%. The opinion that working in a multicultural environment is beneficial is shared by all participants in the LHC experiments and this amounted to 90% of positive responses. The positive aspects of multicultural/multifield interaction are a source of innovation and may benefit the fields outside HEP. Almost 84% of the respondents truly agree this statement. For the Likert scale, Cronebach's \(\alpha\) calculated value is 0.60.

Various aspects of project management including scientific outcome, availability of resources and infrastructure, time pressure, etc. were addressed by question 13. In particular, only 9% of the respondents consider that the scientific outcome was not always kept in mind in the management of the project suggesting a strong sharing of common goals. Fifty-three per cent considered that inadequate resource and infrastructure support constitute an unnecessary obstacle to the development of the project. Althoughthis question was not explored in more detail, the high response reflects a feeling of inadequate resource allocation by CERN as a host laboratory and/or by the participating home institutions. The missing responses to this question amount to 6%. For the Likert scale, Cronebach's \(\alpha\) calculated value is 0.75.

Table 10 reports the values of frequency and importance obtained for question 14. The average missing response amounts to 7%. Four explanatory factors of importance were found:

* technical skills (statements 3, 5, 9, 10, 11, 12)
* scientific skills (statements 4, 6, 7, 8)
* social skills (statements 1, 2, 9, 13)
* labour market skills (statements 14, 15, 16).

These four factors represent 66% of the total variance of all the items. For the Likert scale, Cronebach's \(\alpha\) calculated value is 0.88. In general, having worked for the LHC experiments increased the value for the labour market. Very important has been the impact of increased relations with and knowledge of industry; 26% of the respondents believe that it will be easy for them to find a job in industry.

## 4 Discussion

A scientific centre such as CERN is an ideal place to test and evaluate theories and models on knowledge acquisition, and to carry out quantification of knowledge management in connection with enhanced innovation productivity [12, 13, 14]. This is due to its multidisciplinary environment where R&D research and prototyping is carried out using cutting-edge technology. Existing knowledge transfer models, as applied in companies, do not take into account the scientific knowledge acquisition that is the primary role of a centre such as CERN. In contrast, the model applied in this study takes into account CERN's specific environment, where scientific knowledge is deeply bound to technological knowledge and is largely mediated by the social process occurring during the interaction of many physicists and engineers. At CERN, technology simply represents the way to make available to physicists a world-wide accelerator and detector facility using cutting-edge technologies to investigate the ultimate structure of matter.

The study based on the five LHC experiments makes a detailed analysis of knowledge creation in the technological process based on the model described in Fig. 1, as experienced by the participants.

The results of the present research show that social interaction, relationship quality, and network ties in the multicultural environment of LHC experiments are associated with knowledge acquisition (Table 9 and 10). Figure 1 stresses the importance of communication within and between members of the sub-projects.

Previous knowledge is also an important enabler within a shared framework where a community of practices is acting in facilitating knowledge transfer; this was addressed by asking whether the respondents had participated in other physics experiments (which was mostly the case). The participation in CERN collaborations amounted to 55% and the participation in collaborations outside CERN to 44%. The graphics presented in the present section report data from each LHC experiment. The distribution is very similar in all of them.

Social interaction contributes to the development of the project and has beneficial cross-fertilization effects as illustrated in Figs. 4.1, 4.2 and 4.3.

Communication, interactions, and shared context are important both for knowledge acquisition and transfer [Autio et al. 2003]. These aspects have been, in general, well managed by the LHC experiments except for a minority of people that complained of not having been well enough informed (Fig. 4.2).

All respondents confirmed the importance of interacting with their colleagues both inside and outside their organization; the results obtained for the five individual LHC experiments are reported in Figs. 4.1 - 4.6 and Table 3.11.

Acquired knowledge appreciated by CERN LHC experimenters is a measure of the success of the social process in advancing the scientific and technological processes to create new knowledge and innovation.

LHC experiments generated partnerships and interaction with the industrial world as shown by the answers to questions 16 and 17. The speed with which exchange and synthesis take place between scientists themselves and between scientists and industrial actors is a key factor for innovation. This was shown in the LHC experiments. It must be remembered that the questionnaire refers to relations with the industrial world at the period where most of the relations with industry were coming to an end. In fact, in 2006, at the time when the questionnaire was filled in, the LHC experiments were in their installation phases.

It is important to realise that HEP represents the most efficient way of transferring knowledge by transferring people, as demonstrated by previous studies carried out at CERN [Camporesi 1996, OPAL 2003, Bressan 2004, and da Cruz et al. 2004].

Among the barriers to knowledge transfer there is the insufficiency of money allocated to a project. The answers to question 13.6, reported in Fig. 4.9, indicate that some constraints resulted owing to lack of resources.

It should be recalled that the direct material costs of the experiments exceed one billion Swiss Francs of which only 20% comes from CERN, even though CERN hosts the experiments. On the basis of the replies received, it is difficult to draw any specific conclusions in this respect. It just suggests that the perceived lack of adequate infrastructure support has slowed down progress and possibly resulted in some unwanted technical compromises but that it has not jeopardized the outcome of the project.

In spite of the hindrance identified above, the scientific outcome was never put in question and has remained the main driving force in the project management. This conclusion is supported by Fig. 10.

Knowledge acquisition and the three constructs of social capital (social interaction, relationship quality, and network ties) are considered in the literature as independent variables. Knowledge acquisition is measured by statements reflecting the

Figure 10: The scientific outcome determined in the project management. (\(1=\) disagree, \(7=\) agree).

scientific and technological knowledge that a user may acquire from CERN. Social interaction is measured by statements reflecting the extent to which the relationship between CERN users is characterized by personal and social ties.

The extent of deepening and widening of scientific expertise has been assessed very positively by all five LHC experiments (Fig. 11). This is not surprising considering the fact that HEP research is at the forefront of scientific knowledge.

One important finding of the present study is that interaction amongst scientists and industry has been positive overall. This is due to the need to deal with high technology which has driven the close contact between industry and science. Both sides have learned from each other's goals and constraints (Fig. 12).

The most efficient factor in transferring knowledge is considered to be the mobility of people. CERN, and the LHC experiments in particular, have proved to be

Figure 11: Motivation due to increase in expertise. (\(1=\) disagree, \(7=\) agree).

very instrumental to this end, as indicated by many results presented in various parts of the present study.

In order to better understand the nature of knowledge learning and technological transfer, it was decided to make an Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) to reduce the number of original variables related to personal outcomes of knowledge transfer. In the EFA analysis, principal component analysis was used as the extraction method, rotation being promax (K = 4) with Kaiser normalization. All factors whose eigenvalues exceed 1 before the rotation were accepted. This analysis yielded a clear four-factor solution:

1. Learning of technical skills.
2. Learning of science making skills.

Figure 4.12: Relation and knowledge of the industrial world. (1 = disagree, 7 = agree).

3. Improvement of social network.
4. Increase of possibilities in the labour market.

This solution explained 66% of the extraction sums of squared loadings. The factors and loadings of single items, which measures the experts' personal outcomes of knowledge transfer, are presented in the Table 4.1. One conclusion from this simple factor structure is that the respondents have answered the questionnaire systematically.

According to this result there are four principal dimensions of personal outcome from the research activity in CERN:

1. Learning of new technical skills, like construction skills, planning skills, evaluating skills and skills needed in management.
2. Learning of new scientific knowledge and science making skills, like data analysis skills, paper writing skills, and measuring skills.
3. Improvement and widening of social network.
4. Improvement and widening of labour market competence.

This solution helps us to analyse different dimensions of personal outcomes and will thus guide also the further development of programmes for visitors. When we were comparing, with the aid of ANOVA, the responses of those who were staff at CERN (N = 112) with the answers by visitors (N = 167), we found a statistically significant difference only in one item: "Most important outcome from the collaboration was improvement of social network" (F = 12.5***). The mean of the staff was 4.9 and of visitors 5.4 on the 7-point Likert-style scale. Therefore permanent staff and visitors were evaluating their personal outcomes rather similarly.

We have studied in detail the tools made available within the collaborations to ensure adequate sharing of information. The most modern tools of communications were requested by those physicists who were more familiar with the latest developments in information technology and e-mail together with the telephone. Communication was considered satisfactory except for a small minority. There were statistically significant differences in the value or importance of the communication type between young and old users in CERN. Nor was there any statistically significant difference between physicists and engineering in the value or importance of the communication type, except for the use of e-mail. The engineers (M = 6.3; S.D. = 1.0) find e-mail more valuable than physicists (M = 5.4; S.D. = 1.8) (F = 5.5*)

The fertile environment of the five LHC experiments building and managing multiple processes, involves a dynamic, interactive, and simultaneous exchange of knowledge both inside and outside their organization.

The present study assesses the dynamics of knowledge production and management within the LHC collaborations. It applies largely to the whole physics community from students to university professors and to CERN staff members involved in challenging high-technological developments. The acquired knowledge represents the most important type of direct benefit to society from CERN. It enables people to develop important academic assets and a market value for their acquired skills in the Member States' industries.

Conclusion

While the fundamental science mission of Big Science centres should continue to dominate, greater attention should be paid to maximizing the technological impacts that scientific collaborations may potentially confer to industry and society. Big Science centres as well as the contributing member countries should encourage and prepare the terrain to make possible such kinds of collaboration with industrial companies and make better known the impact on society.

The present large physics collaborations have necessitated a change in approach with a much greater importance given to managerial aspects. This is confirmed by the results obtained in the present study where 94 of 291 respondents had a management and coordination role in addition to their physics or engineering functions. Furthermore, management is acknowledged to be important and useful for their career by almost 50% of the respondents.

Interactions between individuals in the project team who have common interests are important parameters for knowledge transfer which is extended to interactions between experiments. The interaction among the project members was facilitated by the organizational structure and by frequent use of available communication tools. Individuals were able to create and expand knowledge through the social process which also involved industry for many aspects in certain phases of the project development.

Personal outcomes of knowledge transfer have been substantial. These were assessed in terms of the widening of scientific knowledge and social networks, enhancement of scientific skills at different levels (planning, data analysis, paper writing), and acquisition of new technical skills. These positive outcomes, observed in a population of 79% users and 21% staff members, span over a wide age range, benefitting both young and experienced physicists.

The theoretical model, described in the introduction, allows the analysis of knowledge creation, acquisition and transfer, and underlines the importance of the scientific process. It also correlates how, what, and when the three processes (scientific, technological and social) interact at the individual and organizational level [Bressan 2004].

According to the factor analysis presented in this study, these processes appear clearly as three different dimensions. This was also acknowledged by the respondents. The analysis revealed also an additional fourth dimension related to labour market competencies acquisition.

In future, the development of personal skills, according to the four identified factors (learning of technical skills, learning of science making skills, improvement of social network, and increase of employment possibility in labour market) could be used to target individual development for improving opportunities for the labour market.

An organization such as CERN has its own epistemology where the mode of knowledge creation and innovation supersedes the national context. The conditions enabling the process are amplified by the wide multicultural environment. The researchers who responded to the study have shown a positive approach towards going to work for companies or to create their own company. The financial constraints within the LHC experiments resulted in some slowdowns of technical progress but have not jeopardized the final outcome.
