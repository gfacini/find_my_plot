**THE ELECTRONICS CHOICE FOR THE ATLAS FCAL**

John Rutherford

_University of Arizona_

In various parts of the ATLAS liquid argon calorimeter it is planned to use either cold preamps (Silicon or GaAs FET's) or warm, OT preamps. In others the choice is already made. To avoid proliferation of electronics schemes and to ease the complexity of the calorimetry system, the FCal will adopt a system already planned elsewhere with the small modifications dictated by the special needs in the forward region. After considering several schemes the ATLAS FCal Working Group recommends warm preamps and requests endorsement of this recommendation from the LARG electronics steering committee.

**Introduction**

While the ATLAS forward calorimeter (FCal) has some special requirements which lead to differences in the readout, these differences are not so large as to argue for completely different front-end electronics. In the interests of uniformity throughout the complete ATLAS liquid calorimetry system the FCal will adopt electronics similar to that of some other liquid argon subsystem. Early on it appeared reasonable to follow the hadronic endcap and use cold GaAs preamps and summing circuits. This approach had the distinct advantage of saving feedthrough channels. The FCal requires about 6565 preamps per end but their outputs are summed to give about 750 readout channels per end. Summing ahead of the feedthrough then requires many fewer feedthrough channels. It is this solution which is described in the ATLAS Technical Proposal. However closer examination of the MPI GaAs preamps showed these were inappropriate for the FCal. Specifically their dynamic range and maximum input current were too low for the requirements of the FCal, particularly the EM module. The Spanish Fan plans to use warm OT preamps and furthermore some of their pad capacitances are in the same range as the FCal. So compatibility would not be forsaken by following their lead and adapting OT preamps to our needs.

The FCal working group has also considered cold Silicon FET's and has tested some preamps borrowed from BNL in a test beam run in Summer '95. Results from this run are being compared with similar data obtained using warm OT preamps. In a later section welist the considerations and comment on each. But within the FCal Working Group the decision to recommend warm OT preamps was driven primarily by reliability, maintainability, and diagnostic considerations.

### Brief Description of the FCal

**Technology:** The ATLAS FCal is a liquid argon calorimeter but with unusually small argon gaps, about 250 \(\mu\)m in the EM module. A rod, made of the absorber material, is suspended inside a tube by an insulating quartz fiber. The rod is held at high voltage and the tube and absorber matrix at ground. Figure 1 shows the rod and tube electrode structure pulled apart for clarity. These so-called 'tube' electrodes are deployed in an hexagonal pattern as shown in Figure 2 with the tube axis parallel to the accelerator beam. Thus particles from the interaction point (IP) enter the FCal at shallow angles to the tube axis. Tube electrodes are ganged together at one end of the module and connected to a readout coaxial cable. The three FCal modules at one end of ATLAS are shown in Figure 3. Also shown are the beam tube, the inner warm wall of the endcap cryostat, and the inner cold wall of the endcap cryostat in the region of the FCal. Some of the key

parameters of the FCal are listed in Table I.

The three modules of the FCal are mounted in a support cone which is suspended from the front and rear cold walls of the endcap cryostat shown in Figure 4. This cone also serves to constrain the expansion of the cold vessel at pressures up to 4 bar.

**Integrated FCal Concept:** The FCal is _integrated_ into the hadronic endcap calorimeter (HEC) in order to optimize the hermeticity of ATLAS calorimetry. This placement of the FCal avoids the problems engendered when the FCal is moved as far from the interaction point (IP) as possible. The original motivation to locate the FCal far from the IP was to reduce the particle fluxes and radiation damage as much as possible. The particle density goes as the square of the distance. But for many purposes it is the density of showers, not of particles which matters. So the transverse shower size also enters in some comparisons. The _integrated_ FCal largely eliminated a difficult transition between the endcap calorimeters and the FCal near \(\eta=3\) which degraded the physics performance. Also obvious, it is a much smaller device and consequently much less expensive. But perhaps most important it dramatically reduced the backgrounds in the muon system (without adding significant albedo into the inner tracker) and relieved a severe competition for space in the forward region. With a far forward calorimeter there was not enough room

for the muon shielding, the muon endcap toroid inner bore, and the muon chambers. All these had to stay clear of the path to the far FCal. And the massive shielding presented an access problem.

Jets

The FCal detects jets. Of course \(\vec{E}_{T}\) is of premier interest. In fact sum \(\vec{E}_{T}\) is the only information from the FCal required by the Level 1 and Level 2 triggers. However significant \(\vec{E}_{T}\) in the FCal comes only from jets. The background \(\vec{E}_{T}\) will not be ignored but

contributes very little to the global \(\vec{E}_{T}\). Therefore a few qualitative comments about jets are in order.

We will consider two extremes. Consider a hypothetical \(W^{\prime}\) which decays to two jets. For concreteness suppose the mass of the \(W^{\prime}\) is 4 TeV and it is produced at rest in the lab (i.e. in the incident hadron-hadron center-of-mass frame). Then two back-to-back jets with energy of 2 TeV are produced in the decay. Suppose the decay angle is such that these jets make a shallow angle to the forward direction, e.g. suppose \(\eta\)=4. Such a jet, in \(\eta-\phi\) space will be huge, much larger than the canonical \(\Delta R\)=0.5 to 0.7 we usually think of. To make this clear consider instead a decay arbitrarily close to 0\({}^{\circ}\) where each decay jet goes nearly along the beam line. Then the jet size in \(\eta-\phi\) space grows arbitrarily large. This is no surprise. The appropriate coordinates for such jets are not \(\eta-\phi\) but instead \(\theta-\phi\) or even better \(\theta_{x}-\theta_{y}\). The kinematic variables of \(e^{+}-e^{-}\) machines are more appropriate for such jets.

The opposite extreme is the 90\({}^{\circ}\) QCD jet. Consider, naively, an incident parton-parton center-of-mass frame where the reaction produces two outgoing partons at 90\({}^{\circ}\) to the

incident direction. When applying a threshold on the \(E_{T}\) of the final-state jet this is the kinematically most economical way to produce a jet at high \(E_{T}\). Now one transforms (boosts) from the parton-parton center-of-mass to the lab frame and the shape of the boosted jet does not change in \(\eta-\phi\) space. Such a transformation can throw the final-state jet to quite high \(|\eta|\). These are the kinds of jets whose particle energies fit within a cone of \(\Delta R=0.5\) to 0.7 in \(\eta-\phi\) space, roughly independent of \(\eta\) and are the kind we usually consider at hadron colliders. But it is an extreme, albeit most common situation.

Intermediate between these two extremes are other kinds of QCD jets. Consider, for instance, a situation where we trigger on two high \(E_{T}\) jets, roughly balanced, where the two are separated in rapidity \(b_{T}\) some minimum amount. In this case we are preferentially selecting QCD jets whose prouction (scattering) angle in the parton-parton center-of-mass frame is not near \(90^{\circ}\). The larger the rapidity interval we require, the more the jet looks like the first extreme. But in a sample of data such jets are quite rare unless trigger requirements are imposed such as this minimum rapidity interval cut.

Tagging jets in reactions such as \(pp\to Hj_{1}j_{2}X\) are more nearly of the second extreme, i.e. they are approximately like boosted \(90^{\circ}\) QCD jets.

We must also be prepared for pathological jets. We know, for instance, that a high \(E_{T}\) QCD jet will fragment into one (or a narrow cone of several) \(\pi^{0}(s)\) which cannot be differentiated from a single photon with a probability of order \(10^{-4}\). This is a part of the reducible background to a low mass \(H\to\gamma\gamma\). So occasionally we expect to see a high \(E_{T}\) jet in the FCal where all of its energy is electromagnetic and concentrated transversely in a size roughly that of an EM shower.

### Requirements and Constraints

Here we list the performance requirements for the ATLAS FCal and the constraints we face, many derived from practical considerations.

**Physics:** In the FCal we require that jets be measured with a precision of

\[\frac{\Delta E_{T}}{E_{T}}\mathrel{\hbox to 0.0pt{\lower 4.0pt\hbox{ $\sim$}} \raise 1.0pt\hbox{$<$}}10\%\]

for jets with \(E_{T}\mathrel{\hbox to 0.0pt{\lower 4.0pt\hbox{ $\sim$}}\raise 1.0pt\hbox{$>$}}100\) GeV. This requirement places constraints on both the energy and angle resolution. At smaller \(|\eta|\) (i.e. larger \(\theta\)) the necessary angle accuracy is easy to achieve but the energy resolution is more of a challenge. At larger \(|\eta|\) the required angle resolution is difficult to achieve while the energy resolution is easier since the energies are typically larger and calorimeter resolution improves with energy. Typically though this requirement constrains \(\Delta\theta/\theta\mathrel{\hbox to 0.0pt{\lower 4.0pt\hbox{ $\sim$}} \raise 1.0pt\hbox{$<$}}7\%\) and \(\Delta E/E\mathrel{\hbox to 0.0pt{\lower 4.0pt\hbox{ $\sim$}} \raise 1.0pt\hbox{$<$}}7\%\). The angle resolution constraint is one of the principle reasons we chose tungsten as the absorber for the hadronic modules. In tungsten the transverse spreading of hadronic showers is smaller and therefore the shower core is better determined.

Furthermore we require that the tails on the resolution function be quite small, especially on the high \(E_{T}\) side of the resolution function. The signal, particularly at small near 100 GeV can be swamped by, for instance, two-jet events where the \(E_{T}\) of one or both jets is measured poorly leading to a significant false. If \(\Delta E_{T}/E_{T}\mathrel{\hbox to 0.0pt{\lower 4.0pt\hbox{ $\sim$}}\raise 1.0pt \hbox{$<$}}10\%\) (which describes the central part of the resolution distribution) then this background is dominated not by the bulk of the resolution function itself but by the non-Gaussian tails.

**Radiation environment:** In the forward region the energies and densities of particles from the IP are the largest. The resulting ionizing radiation (of order \(10^{2}-10^{6}\) Gy/yr) and the neutron fluence (of order \(10^{13}-10^{16}\) neutrons/cm\({}^{2}\)/yr integrated over the complete energy spectrum) at the FCal are so large that the front-end electronics cannot be mounted on the FCal itself. In fact special attention to all material making up the FCal modules is essential in order to avoid the possibility of long-term physical damage and poisoning of the argon.

The module construction is therefore made particularly simple. The principle ingredients are the absorber material, Copper and Tungsten alloy, some structural members of stainless steel, and quartz fibers to maintain the liquid argon gap. In addition at the ends of the modules are polyimide circuit boards on which Copper pads gang the tube electrodes together (in 4's in the EM module) and route the signals to the periphery where the

readout cables are attached.

The other principle ingredient is, or course, the liquid argon. Neutrons can cause transmutation of the Argon and this has been calculated in detail. (See for instance L.Waters and W.B.Wilson, ATLAS Internal Note CAL-NO-47.) \({}^{41}\)Ar is the major problem isotope. It has a half-life of about two hours and could present problems during fast accesses or during emergency venting of argon. Both have been analyzed by the safety group and are not a problem. Approximately the same amount of \({}^{41}\)Ar is produced in the HEC so the FCal only doubles the accumulation of this isotope.

It is the reaction of argon to ionizing radiation which is the most interesting. Argon is used as the sensitive medium exactly because of its ionizing properties and because, once free, the electron can drift long distances without attachment. The radiation backgrounds produce high levels of ionization in the liquid argon gaps which then drift out due to the electric field. However the positive ions drift so slowly that they build up in the gap and the electric field becomes distorted. (See J.Rutherford, GEM TN-91-27.) We avoid this build-up of positive ions in the FCal readout electrodes by employing narrow gaps, 250 \(\mu\)m in the EM module. Narrow gaps, however, lead to large electrode capacitances, of order 1.5 nF for each gang of four tubes in the EM module.

The ionizing radiation peaks near EM shower maximum in the EM module while the neutron fluence has a broad peak just beyond hadronic shower maximum. Because of this we have located the readout of the EM module at the upstream end of the EM module and the readout of the first hadronic module at the downstream end of the HAD1 module. Hadronic shower maximum is near the boundary between these two modules and we have therefore placed the polyimide readout boards as far as possible from this region. Such considerations prevent us from contemplating further depth segmentation. (Economics also drives such considerations.)

It is therefore clear that the electronics must be located remotely. Included are the HV blocking capacitor, HV protection resistor, and calibration circuits. Because of fast shaping the signals must be carried by transmission lines from the electrodes to the preamps. For the cold electronics option, the preamps could be located at the downstream end of the cryostat behind the Copper absorber behind the HEC. The transmission line would then be of order several meters in length for the EM module and shorter for the hadronic modules.

**Pileup Noise:** For essentially all luminosities at which ATLAS might take data, i.e. above 10\({}^{32}\) cm\({}^{-2}\) sec\({}^{-1}\), the pile-up noise in the FCal will dominate the thermal noise generated by the front end electronics. So it is important to have fast shaping of the FCal signals to reduce the pile-up noise as much as possible. One result of fast shaping, however, is to reduce the size of the signal. For practical reasons one can't reduce the signal too much because coherent noise cannot be entirely eliminated and can become a problem. On the other hand one cannot reduce the pile-up noise below the level obtained in a single bunch crossing. It is convenient to quote pile-up noise relative to this minimum amount. Practical shaping times lead to pile-up noise not far above this minimum. For our present prototypes the pileup noise is \(\sim 1.3\) to 1.4 times above this minimum. We are close to the point of diminishing returns.

Because the FCal detects and measures jets, it is the pileup within a jet cone which we focus on. In the FCal where a (QCD) jet in \(x-y\) space is quite small much of the jet energy is carried to larger transverse distances from the jet core via hadronic shower spreading. In order to achieve adequate jet energy resolution we must add a boundary zone around the canonical jet cone in order to include this calorimeter energy. The width of this zone depends on the absorber material. The choice of Tungsten for the absorber material allows this zone to be quite narrow and therefore reduces the area of the calorimeter included in any jet energy summation. This minimization reduces the pileup energy under the jet as well. At large \(|\eta|\) this area would be almost a factor 2 larger if the hadronic absorber material were changed to Copper.

**Feature Size:** Conventional liquid argon electrodes have gaps of order 2 mm. Because of the positive ion buildup problem we require gaps considerably smaller than this. But it is an engineering challenge to design a device with such small gaps with the required

Figure 6: Electronics noise within a jet cone versus the central \(|\eta|\) of the cone. The size of the cone is set by \(\Delta R=0.5\) but in addition a border is added around the periphery to account for shower spreading of the hadronic components of the jet in the calorimeter. For comparison the rms pileup \(E_{T}\) noise in the same area at a luminosity of \(10^{34}\) cm\({}^{-2}\) sec\({}^{-1}\) is about 8 GeV, roughly independent of \(|\eta|\).

tolerances. To meet this challenge in an economical way we employ 'tube' electrodes where the tubes are oriented longitudinally along the beam direction. Particles incident on this array are nearly parallel to the tube axes. The electrode separation and tube radius in the EM module are set by requirements of uniformity of response to EM showers. We find that a hexagonal pattern with nearest neighbor tube-to-tube spacing of 7.5 mm is both adequate for uniformity of EM showers and affordable. For a given tube-to-tube spacing the radius of the gap is next chosen to optimize the uniformity of sampling across the face of the FCal. Electrodes with much larger spacing than the present values would give unacceptable inhomogeneities in the response to EM showers across the front face of the FCal.

The electrodes in the Had1 and Had2 FCal modules are arranged to be _pseudoprojective_, i.e. the tube-to-tube spacing is larger in proportion to distance from the IP so that projective towers can easily be formed.

**Ganging:** Simply wiring several tube electrodes together at the readout end provides ganging and sets the transverse segmentation. When an EM shower impinges near the center of a gang of four tubes about 70% of the shower energy is deposited in the tower. The capacitance of this gang of four tube electrodes adds to about 1.5 nF, a rather large but manageable detector capacitance. The four tubes, wired together in this way, are then connected to a coaxial cable. These connections have rather low inductance so the signal is removed cleanly from the detector. We presently propose to use a 20 \(\Omega\) cable which then gives a 30 ns characteristic integration time for the triangle pulse at the preamp and a loss of half the peak current. Ganging more electrodes together would lead to greater losses in transporting the signal to the preamp unless we went to lower impedance cable, a technical challenge.

In the Had1 and Had2 modules the ganging is by sixes and eights respectively to yield roughly the same capacitance per readout tower as in the EM module. See Table I. The capacitance of each tube electrode is lower because the liquid argon gaps can be made larger due to the lower ionization density from pile-up events deep in the hadronic shower.

While the sampling fraction is small in the FCal (the \(dE/dx\) weighted sampling fraction is about 1.5% in the EM module for instance) the sampling _frequency_ is comparable to that in the other ATLAS EM calorimeters. So the initial current at the electrode (the peak of the triangle current pulse) for an EM shower depositing 2.5 TeV of energy into a single tower (of four ganged tube electrodes) is 4 mA. The peak current into the preamp is about half this due to the \(RC\) time constant of the detector capacitance and readout coax cable impedance.

Because a single gang of four tube electrodes can capture as much as 70% of the energy of an EM shower, because jets can occasionally fragment to a single (or tightly collimated bunch of) \(\pi^{0}(s)\) which looks like an EM shower in the FCal, because the kinematic limit for jets gives a maximum jet energy of about 7 TeV, we somewhat arbitrarily set the maximum energy we expect to see in a single EM gang of four tubes to be 2.5 TeV corresponding to a jet at half the kinematic limit fragmenting as an EM shower. This sets the example in the previous paragraph as our limit.

**Summing:** Except at the highest values of \(|\eta|\) the segmentation afforded by the ganging is finer than necessary. So the preamp outputs can be summed to yield readout channels. These readout channels span an \(\eta\) range of roughly 0.15 in the EM module and are coarser in the hadronic modules. This reflects our strategy to employ the EM module to largely determine the angle of the jet (and part of its energy) and the hadronic modules to complete the energy measurement. The number of preamps (i.e. number of ganged tube electrodes) and the number of readout channels at each FCal module are listed in Table I.

**Dynamic Range:** The electronics noise due to each gang of tube electrodes (after filtering) i; about 150 MeV. We ask that this rms noise be measured with a precision a factor 2 above the smallest signal which can be measured. That is we require 75 MeV to give one count on the readout ADC. The largest signal we expect to measure was defined above to be 2.5 TeV. This requires an electronics system capable of a dynamic range of 15 bits.

While the pileup noise dominates the electronics noise above luminosities of \(10^{32}\) cm\({}^{-2}\) sec\({}^{-1}\), the electronics noise is important below this luminosity. Since ATLAS may well run at such luminosities in the first year the electronics should be capable of precision in this quieter environment. Hence we set the low end of the dynamic range at the electronics noise level.

Non-linear amplifiers can be used to compress the dynamic range, however not in the preamps because of the subsequent summing circuits. The preamps must be linear. But the sum circuit outputs could be made non-linear.

**Transitions:** The transition between the FCal and the HEC at \(|\eta|\sim 3.1\) is designed to be in the shadow of the EM endcap. This is so that no particles from the IP can strike the HEC directly since it, by itself, is not deep enough in interaction lengths to contain hadronic showers.

The edge of ATLAS calorimetric coverage at \(|\eta|=4.9\) is carefully designed to be as clean as possible so that minimal spray is generated by particles striking this transition. This then requires less massive shielding further downstream. The optimal design allows a narrow cone of particles from the IP to escape downstream where they are buried in the shielding around the collimator for the final focus quadrupoles. Since the cone has a small opening angle determined by the \(|\eta|=\)4.9 edge, the shielding can be relatively modest and still do the job.

**Electrical Properties of the 'Tube' Electrodes**

Each tube electrode acts as a short transmission line of characteristic impedance \(Z_{t}=5.2\ \Omega\). Figure 7 shows schematically the connections in the EM FCal module where four such tube electrodes are ganged together and connected to a \(Z_{c}=20\ \Omega\) readout coax cable. The four tube electrodes together act as a single transmission line of characteristic impedance \(Z_{D}=Z_{t}/4=1.3\ \Omega\). The speed of propagation of signals on the tube electrode is such that the delay time down and back on one of them is \(2t_{d}=3.7\) ns. Signals on the tube electrodes are reflected at the interface with the readout coax cable with a reflection coefficient of \(\mathcal{R}=(Z_{e}-Z_{D})/(Z_{e}+Z_{D})=0.88\). Thus signals bounce back and forth on the electrodes quite a few times before being drained off.

First let us make some simple observations related to the discussion above. 1) It doesn't matter whether or not the four tube electrodes are connected together at the far end from the ganging point. 2) A charge injected onto just one of the tube electrodes when it first propagates to the ganging point will be reflected at the interface such that some fraction of the charge is transmitted down the readout coax cable and some ends up on the other three tube electrodes. By superposition arguments (or by simply, but laboriously, working out the cases in detail) it is straightforward to show that the four tube electrodes act as a single transmission line of characteristic impedance of \(Z_{D}=Z_{t}/4=1.3\)\(\Omega\) as claimed above _when_ viewed from the far end of the readout coax cable. 3) When a charge \(Q_{\delta}\) is deposited instantaneously onto one tube electrode at one end of the electrode, the delta function current waveform reflects back and forth on the electrode structure such that a train of delta functions is seen on the readout coax cable, each separated from the next by \(2t_{d}=3.7\) ns and each of charge

\[Q(n)=Q_{\delta}(1-\mathcal{R})\mathcal{R}^{n}=Q_{\delta}(1-\mathcal{R})e^{-t/ \tau};\quad t=2nt_{d},\quad n=0,1,2\ldots\]

where \(\tau=Z_{e}C_{D}\) where the detector (four tube electrodes) capacitance \(C_{D}=t_{d}/Z_{D}=1.46\) nF and t is measured starting from the first delta function charge pulse on the coax readout cable. Actual current waveforms injected onto the tube electrodes are triangles with base width 50 ns (for the EM module) and also are spread out somewhat over the length of the tube electrode. The resulting waveform on the readout coax cable is then far smoother than

Figure 7: Transmission line model of the FCal EM electrode matching to the readout cable.

was the case for the delta function charge injection. The shaper circuit further smooths the waveform so that the structure due to the transmission line features of the detector are almost completely wiped out. Rather than thinking of the deposited charge rattling back and forth on the tube electrodes one can think of the tube electrodes as one large capacitance with the cable draining the charge off with time constant \(\tau=Z_{e}C_{D}\).

Figure 8 shows the pulse at the shaper output for a triangle current waveform deposited at one end of a tube electrode. Also displayed is a difference waveform which shows that the structure due to the reflections of the triangle pulse on the electrodes is of order 0.05% rms near the peak of the shaped pulse.

### Calibration

There will be a few special calibration lines which will feed pulses onto selected tube electrodes near the outer periphery of the FCal where the radiation fields are relatively low. But for the bulk of the channels the calibration must be accomplished by injecting a waveform at the input to the preamps (either warm or cold). At this point in the circuit

Figure 8: Waveform at the shaper output when a triangle current waveform is deposited at one end of a tube electrode. The reflections are not visible on the shaped output unless an even smoother waveform is first subtracted and the remainder greatly amplified (scale on the right). Near the maximum of the shaped pulse the rms size of the signal variations due to the signal reflecting around on the electrodes is about 0.05%.

albeit rarely. There will be perhaps a few accesses to the crack region per year, maybe more at the beginning. On the other hand we may never open the cryostat, so broken channels in the cold may never be fixed. Only if there is a major failure will we entertain this possibility. If there is a short on an electrode which cannot be fixed (see below) we then remove that preamp (and HV) in the warm option. For the cold option we must suffer the HV current draw through the protection resistor. We cannot afford many such shorts on a single HV supply. That's why we have so many supplies.

**Diagnostics:** While we are designing the FCal to be so robust that nothing goes wrong, there is always the possibility of unforeseen problems. In the case of warm electronics there are several diagnostic capabilities. 1) The detector capacitance can be measured at the feedthrough. For instance the preamp board can be temporarily replaced by a special measurement board which, under computer control, scans all channels and measures the capacitance of each. (Arizona macse such a system for the DO liquid argon calorimeter.) 2) The current draw of each channel as a function of HV can be determined. In case of a short or excessive current draw we might be able to 'burn out' the electrode by supplying large currents (not to exceed the capabilities of the readout coax) on the electrode. The electrodes themselves are relatively immune to pitting under breakdown. While we have not seen such shorts in our prototypes the endcap cryostat will be a different environment in which we should plan to encounter some level of foreign matter which could drift into an electrode and cause problems. 3) Special waveforms can be introduced at the feedthrough and the reflections measured with precision equipment. This data can be analyzed for various problems.

Figure 10: The numbers 1 to 8 in circles indicate places where a junction between a cable and a connector is located.

**Performance:** The \(\mathcal{O}\)T preamp is an excellent line terminator. Its input impedance can be set with precision even for the relatively low values we require. Also the circuit is quite linear over a wide dynamic range.

**FET preamps are designed to be mounted on the electrodes themselves and are the recommended solution when low electronics noise is a critical requirement. They do not have quite as precise input impedances particularly in the 20 \(\Omega\) range. The FET input impedance is directly proportional to \(1/g_{m}\) which can vary from channel to channel and with pulse height. FET's also have designed into them large input capacitances so the termination is not all resistive. (See R.L. Chase _et al._, Nucl. Instrum. and Methods **A330** (1993) 228, page 235, Section 3.1.) This causes reflections on the line leading to increased pileup noise and pulse shape anomalies. And the change with pulse height leads to non-linearities.

**HV:** In either electronics option the HV is introduced at the preamp input and carried to the electrode on the readout coax cable. The values required vary from 250 V for the EM module to 500 V for the HAD2 module. These potentials are relatively low due to the small liquid argon gaps in the FCal but yield the canonical electric field of 10 kV/cm in the gap. The cable must be capable of standing off this potential. The blocking capacitor and protection resistor are located at this same point as indicated in Figure 9. In the case of the warm electronics the feedthrough must also stand off this potential. Further R&D is required to verify this under various scenarios. If feedthroughs near the top of the cryostat are in gaseous Argon then breakdown is possible since the breakdown potential of gaseous Argon is quite low. In the cold option the protection resistor and blocking capacitor are in the cold and their reliabilities are unknown. We may have to design parallel systems similar to the scheme adopted by SLD.

**Feedthroughs:** As Table I shows there are 6565 preamps per end and in the warm option each must be cabled through the feedthrough. The virtue of the cold option is that, since preamps are summed the number of resulting channels which must be brought out of the feedthrough is much less, of order 750 channels, a great savings in feedthroughs. But this is not the whole story. In the warm option there will be a few (\(\sim 64\)) additional special calibration lines for additional diagnostics. In the cold option all the calibration lines, control lines, HV, and LV must be fed into the cryostat. These add to a total of about 1200 channels. Still the cold option affords an appreciable savings in feedthroughs. There is strong pressure to keep 32 feedthru assemblies per cryostat. This is driven by symmetry considerations and timing due to cable lengths. So the cold electronics option would save feedthru pins. At \(\sim 13\) CHF/pin the cost differential is about 140 kCHF.

**Recommendation**

The FCal working group, with experience from test beam runs, feels that the reliability, maintainability, and diagnostic criteria are of paramount importance and therefore recommends the warm electronics option. Cold electronics are appropriate only when their special features (low electronics noise, mounted directly on electrodes) are demanded. The other considerations are less definitive and do not, in total, argue strongly for one option or the other.
