###### Abstract

The ATLAS collaboration has measured several final state observables that are sensitive to parton radiation in top anti-top quark final states produced in proton-proton collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of \(\sqrt{s}=7\) TeV. These measurements are compared to Monte Carlo generators implementing several different models and with systematic model parameter variations. Future measurements to constrain parton radiation are proposed and the predictions of various Monte Carlo generators are compared.

Introduction

The modelling of final state particles in events where top quarks are produced is one of the major systematic uncertainties in measurements of the top anti-top quark (\(t\bar{t}\)) pair production cross section and of the top quark properties. In order to constrain these uncertainties the ATLAS collaboration has measured several final state observables that are sensitive to parton radiation in \(t\bar{t}\) final states produced in proton-proton collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of \(\sqrt{s}=7\) TeV at the LHC. A brief description of these measurements is as follows.

In Ref. [1] the probability that the \(t\bar{t}\) events contain no additional jet with transverse momentum above a threshold (\(Q_{0}\)) is measured in four different central rapidity intervals. A measurement in which events are vetoed if the scalar transverse momentum sum of the additional jets (\(Q_{\rm sum}\)) in each rapidity interval is above a threshold is also performed. The measurement is performed in the dilepton decay channel. The event selection criteria include requiring the presence of two identified \(b\)-jets, which are excluded from the jet veto requirement.

In Ref. [2] the multiplicity of jets for various \(p_{\rm T}\) thresholds is measured in the single lepton \(t\bar{t}\) decay channel in the rapidity region \(|y|<2.5\).

These measurements are compared to Monte Carlo (MC) generators implementing NLO or LO QCD matrix elements for \(2\to 2\) or \(2\to n\) (with \(n\) up to 5) hard scattering processes with parton shower matching and different hadronisation models. The MC models and settings used for comparisons are described in Section 2. The comparisons to gap fraction and jet multiplicity measurements are shown in Sections 3 and 4.

In addition, future measurements to constrain parton radiation are proposed and discussed. These include measurements of the internal jet structure (Section 5) and the kinematic variables in the reconstructed top (anti-top) quark or the ditop system (Section 6). The sensitivity of the proposed observables to radiation modeling is demonstrated by comparisons of selected MC event generator predictions.

All studies are performed at particle level using MC samples. The studies in this note are relevant to TOP LHC Working Group discussions aimed at the formulation of future recommendations for event modelling systematics that will be adopted by the ATLAS and CMS collaborations.

## 2 Monte Carlo generator samples

The following MC generators are used for the studies:

* The MC@NLO+Herwig, AUET2 sample is simulated using the MC@NLO [3] event generator (v4.01) with the CT10 [4] parton distribution function (PDF). An NLO matrix element (ME) is used for the \(t\bar{t}\) hard scattering process. Parton showers, hadronisation and the underlying event are modelled using the Herwig (v6.520) [5] and Jimmy (v4.31) [6] generators. The Herwig and Jimmy ATLAS AUET2 tune [7] is used. The hard process scale is fixed at the MC@NLO generator default which is the average of the top quark (\(t\)) and the anti-top quark (\(\bar{t}\)) transverse masses: \[Q^{2}=\frac{p_{T,t}^{2}+p_{T,\bar{t}}^{2}}{2}+m_{t}^{2},\] (1) where \(p_{T,t(\bar{t})}\) corresponds to the transverse momentum of the top or anti-top quark and \(m_{t}\) is the top quark mass. The renormalisation and factorisation scales are set to the value of the scale \(Q\).
* The Powheg+Pythia, P2011C sample is generated using Powheg-hvq (patch4) [8], [9] with CT10 PDF. An NLO matrix element is used for the \(t\bar{t}\) hard scattering process. The parton shower (PS) and the underlying event are simulated using Pythia (v6.425) with CTEQ6L1 [10] PDF and the corresponding Perugia 2011C tune [11] intended to be used with this PDF. The hard process (renormalisation and factorisation) scales are fixed at the generator default value that corresponds to: \[Q^{2}=m_{t}^{2}+p_{T}^{2},\] (2) where \(m_{t}\) and \(p_{T}\) are the top quark mass and the top quark transverse momentum, evaluated for the underlying Born configuration (i.e. before radiation).
* The Powheg\(+\)Pythia, AUET2B sample is generated using the same matrix element events as the Powheg\(+\)Pythia, P2011C sample. The parton shower and the underlying event are added using Pythia with CTEQ6L1 PDFs and the corresponding ATLAS AUET2B tune [12].
* The Powheg\(+\)Herwig, AUET2 sample is generated using the same matrix element events as the Powheg\(+\)Pythia, P2011C sample. The parton shower and the underlying events are added using the Herwig and Jimmy with the CT10 PDFs and ATLAS AUET2 tune [7].
* The Alpgen\(+\)Herwig, AUET2 sample is generated using Alpgen (v2.13) together with the Herwig and Jimmy generators. In Alpgen up to five additional final state partons are used in the matrix elements describing the hard scattering process in leading order. For the matrix element calculations and the parton shower evolution the CTEQ6L1 PDF is used. The corresponding AUET2 Herwig and Jimmy tune [7] to the ATLAS data is used. The choice of the hard process scale is fixed at the generator default1: Footnote 1: That corresponds to the value of Alpgen parameter iqopt\(=\)1. \[Q^{2}=\sum m_{T}^{2},\,\text{with}\,\,m_{T}^{2}=m^{2}+p_{T}^{2},\] (3) where the sum runs over heavy quarks and light jets2 with mass \(m\) and transverse momentum \(p_{T}\). The renormalisation and factorisation scales are set to the value of the scale \(Q\). The parton level phase space cuts used for the matrix element level event generation are set using the following Alpgen parameters: ptimin\(=\)15 GeV and drjmin\(=\)0.7. The parameters used for MLM matching [13] are set using the following Alpgen parameters: ETCLUS\(=\)20 GeV and RCLUS\(=\)0.7.
* The Alpgen\(+\)Pythia, P2011 sample is generated using Alpgen (v2.14) complemented with the parton shower and hadronisation based on Pythia used with the Perugia 2011 tune [11]. The CTEQ5L PDF [14] is used for both the hard process and the parton shower. The hard process scale choice and the parton level phase space cuts used for generating the sample are the same as for the Alpgen\(+\)Herwig, AUET2 sample apart from the Alpgen parameter settings xlclu\(=\)0.26 GeV and lpclu\(=\)1, recommended to be used with the Perugia 2011 tune for matched generators [15]. The MLM matching parameters are set to the same values used for the Alpgen\(+\)Herwig, AUET2 sample. Additional samples are produced to estimate the effect of more or less radiation. The number of additional partons is altered by varying the Alpgen renormalisation scale associated with the strong coupling \(\alpha_{\text{S}}\) in the matrix element calculation. The scale is varied by a factor of two relative to the original scale \(k_{\text{T}}\) between two partons (setting the ktfac parameter to 0.5 and 2.0). Two different procedures are used. In the first approach, the scale of \(\alpha_{\text{S}}\) is changed within the matrix element calculation only while the parton shower tune and scale choice are the same as for the central sample. These samples are referred to as Alpgen\(+\)Pythia(as_down,central) and Alpgen\(+\)Pythia(as_up,central). In a second approach, the scale of \(\alpha_{\text{S}}\) is consistently varied in the ME and the parton shower and referred to as Alpgen\(+\)Pythia(as_down,radLo) and Alpgen\(+\)Pythia(as_up,radHi) respectively. The Perugia 2011 radLo and radHi tunes [11] are used for the sample generation accordingly. In order to assess the modelling uncertainty due to the particular choice of the drjmin and RCLUS Alpgen parameters (called \(dR\) in the following) in the matrix element and shower, additional systematic variations (\(dR\)=0.4 and \(dR\)=1.0) are considered. In the matrix element, \(dR\) constrains the minimal distance between the partons. In the MLM matching, the \(dR\) parameter is used to control both the cluster radius and the minimum jet-parton separation which are used to define the jet-parton matching.
* The Sherpa (version 1.3.1) [16] samples are generated with CTEQ6L1 PDF. The hard scattering is simulated using a matrix element with up to three additional partons in the final state. For the hadronisation and the underlying event the default generator tune is used. This provides an independent LO matrix element calculation with a different matching scheme (CKKW [17]) between the matrix element and the parton shower.
* The AcerMC+Pythia LessPS and MorePS samples are generated with the AcerMC generator [18] (v3.8) interfaced with Pythia (v6.425). The CTEQ6L1 PDF is used for both the ME and the parton shower calculations, and the corresponding CTEQ6L1 tune from the Perugia 2011 author tune series (Perugia 2011C) is used for Pythia. On top of the central tune, variations of Pythia parameters controlling initial and final state radiation (ISR/FSR) are performed without retuning of other parameters in order to obtain a simple estimate of the effect of the ISR/FSR uncertainty. The parameters changed with respect to the Perugia 2011C values are as follows: LessPS sample: PARP(67)=0.60, PARP(64)=3.50, PARP(72)=0.11 GeV, MorePS sample: PARP(67)=1.40, PARP(64)=0.90, PARP(72)=0.37 GeV. The parameter variations are selected such that the variation samples bracket the observed distributions in the ATLAS top data, including the jet gap fraction measurement data [1].

The generator tunes used for all samples include early LHC data, but do not include data with top quarks in the final state. All MC generator samples are produced within the ATLAS software framework. In addition, a sample generated within the CMS software framework is used for some of the studies.

* The MadGraph+Pythia, Z2, sample is generated using MadGraph[19] (v5.1.1.0) with the CTEQ6L1 PDF. The Pythia(v6.424) generator with the Z2 tune [20] by the CMS collaboration is used for parton showers and hadronisation. The \(t\bar{t}\) events with up to three additional partons in the (leading order) ME are generated and the kt-MLM matching scheme is used [13].

In the following, Powheg and MC@NLO will be called NLO MC generators while Alpgen, Sherpa and MadGraph will be called multi-leg MC generators.

## 3 Measurement of \(t\bar{t}\) production with a veto on additional central jet activity

A measurement of \(t\bar{t}\) production with a veto on additional central jet activity has been performed in Ref. [1]. Events with \(t\bar{t}\) in the final state are selected in the dilepton decay channel with two identified \(b\)-jets from the top quark decays. Events are vetoed if they contain an additional jet with transverse momentum above a threshold in a central rapidity interval. The fraction of events surviving the jet veto is presented as a function of this threshold for four different central rapidity interval definitions. An alternate measurement is also performed, in which events are vetoed if the scalar transverse momentum sum of the additional jets in each rapidity interval is above a threshold. In both measurements, the data are corrected for detector effects and compared to the theoretical models implemented in MC@NLO, Powheg, Alpgen and Sherpa.

The variable of interest is the 'gap fraction', defined as

\[f(Q_{0})=\frac{n(Q_{0})}{N}, \tag{4}\]

where \(N\) is the number of selected \(t\bar{t}\) events and \(n(Q_{0})\) is the subset of these events that do not contain an additional jet with transverse momentum, \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\), above a threshold, \(Q_{0}\), in a central rapidity interval.

The veto criterion can be extended to probe jet activity beyond the leading additional jet. An alternate definition of the gap fraction is used in this case,

\[f(Q_{\mathrm{sum}})=\frac{n(Q_{\mathrm{sum}})}{N} \tag{5}\]

where \(n(Q_{\mathrm{sum}})\) is the number of \(t\bar{t}\) events in which the scalar transverse momentum sum of the additional jets in the rapidity interval is less than \(Q_{\mathrm{sum}}\). The gap fraction defined using \(Q_{0}\) is mainly sensitive to the leading-\(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) emission accompanying the \(t\bar{t}\) system, whereas the gap fraction defined using \(Q_{\mathrm{sum}}\) is sensitive to all hard emissions accompanying the \(t\bar{t}\) system.

A third 'gap fraction' is also defined, attempting to probe radiation beyond that for which the NLO generators might be expected to provide a good description. Events in this case are only vetoed if they contain **two** additional jets with \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) larger than the veto scale \(Q_{0}\). I.e.

\[f^{\prime}(Q_{0})=\frac{n^{\prime}(Q_{0})}{N} \tag{6}\]

where, \(n^{\prime}(Q_{0})\) is the subset of the \(t\bar{t}\) events which do not contain two additional jets, both with \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) above the veto scale \(Q_{0}\). No ATLAS measurement has been performed for this variable so far.

The measured gap fraction as a function of \(Q_{0}\) is compared with the predictions from the multi-leg LO and NLO MC generators in Fig. 1 for various rapidity regions. In the central region all MC generator are compatible with the data, with the exception of the MC@NLO+Herwig generator, which is systematically above the data.. In the forward rapidity regions all MC generator have difficulty in describing the data, especially at low \(Q_{0}\). The generator that is closest to the data is Sherpa. The measured gap fraction as a function of \(Q_{\mathrm{sum}}\) is compared with the multi-leg LO and NLO generators in Fig. 2. The conclusions are similar to those drawn from Fig. 1, but now MadGraph+Pythia and Powheg+Pythia also show poorer agreement with data.

Fig. 3 shows a comparison of ATLAS data to various predictions from Alpgen + Pythia with increased and reduced radiation. The parameter variations used for the various samples are explained in Section 2. The central sample using nominal parameter settings agrees well with the data. The systematic variations bracket the data. In particular the central rapidity region is very well described. In the forward region, at \(|y|>1.5\), all variations are below the data i.e. the radiation is overestimated. Reducing the radiation via softer \(\alpha_{s}\) in the Alpgen matrix element leads to better agreement in this particular distribution. While the soft and the central variant are both roughly compatible with the data within their uncertainties, the variants leading to a harder shower i.e. reduced scale of \(\alpha_{s}\) in the matrix element with or without shower changes can both be excluded.

In Fig. 4 the gap fraction distribution is shown for the different choices of the \(dR\) parameter (described in Section 2). The default values of the relevant parameters used in the samples generated by ATLAS and in the Alpgen code correspond to \(dR=0.7\). The distributions for \(dR=0.4\) and \(dR=1\) choices are shown. In the very forward region again all predictions are below the data.

In summary all the considered Alpgen+Pythia configurations over-estimate the radiation of additional jets in rapidity region \(1.5\leq|y|<2.1\). The data-MC differences can be reduced using a tighter \(dR\)Figure 1: The measured gap fraction as a function of \(Q_{0}\) is compared with the prediction from the NLO and multi-leg LO MC generators in the three rapidity regions, (a) \(|y|<0.8\), (b) \(0.8\leq|y|<1.5\) and (c) \(1.5\leq|y|<2.1\). Also shown, (d), is the gap fraction for the full rapidity range \(|y|<2.1\). The data is represented as closed (black) circles with statistical uncertainties. The yellow band is the total experimental uncertainty on the data (statistical and systematic). The theoretical predictions are shown as solid and dashed coloured lines. All samples apart from MadGraph+Pythia, Z2 sample are generated within the ATLAS framework. The MadGraph+Pythia, Z2 sample is generated within the CMS framework.

Also shown, (d), is the gap fraction for the full rapidity range \(|y|<2.1\). The data and theory predictions are represented in the same way as in Fig. 1. All samples apart from MadGraph+Pythia, Z2 sample are generated within the ATLAS framework. The MadGraph+Pythia, Z2 sample is generated within the CMS framework.

Data (closed black circles) as well as various predictions from Alpgen+Pythia (P2011) using different scales of \(\alpha_{s}\) are shown. The yellow band represents the total experimental uncertainty on the data (statistical and systematic). The rapidity regions of \(|y|<0.8\) (top), \(0.8\leq|y|<1.5\) (middle) and \(1.5\leq|y|<2.1\) are shown.

value as well as by using a lower \(\alpha_{s}\) value in the Alpgen matrix element. However, from the observables studied in this note, the source of the problem cannot be uniquely identified. Neither variation alone is enough to provide good agreement with the data.

Finally, the gap fraction as defined in equation 6 is presented in Fig. 5. No ATLAS measurement was performed for this variable, so a particle-level comparison is made instead. The various MC generators differ by at most \(\sim\)3.5% with respect to the Alpgen prediction.

## 4 Jet multiplicity in \(t\overline{t}\) events

A single-lepton selection in events with large missing transverse energy, at least three jets with \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>\)25 GeV and at least one \(b\)-jet described in Ref. [2] was used to select reconstructed events. The background contributions were subtracted from the data and the resulting jet multiplicity distributions were unfolded to a fiducial region.

The fully corrected particle-jet multiplicities for the jet \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) thresholds 25, 40, 60, and 80 GeV using these data are shown in Fig. 6 and Fig. 7 from Ref. [2], for the electron and muon channels, respectively. They are compared to predictions from Alpgen+Herwig, Alpgen+Pythia (\(\alpha_{\mathrm{S}}\)-down), MC@NLO+Herwig and the Powheg+Pythia MC models. The predictions of the different Alpgen+Pythia models (nominal as well as the \(\alpha_{\mathrm{S}}\)-up and \(\alpha_{\mathrm{S}}\)-down variations) are compared with data in Fig. 8 and Fig. 9 from Ref. [2]. The number of events shown in each of the distributions corresponds to an integrated luminosity of \(4.7\pm 0.2\) fb\({}^{-1}\).

For the lowest jet \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) threshold, all MC predictions agree well with the data in the three and four-jet multiplicity bins. Powheg and MC@NLO have an NLO treatment of the \(t\overline{t}\) final state, an LO treatment of the \(t\overline{t}j\) final state, and a leading log treatment of any additional jets. The MC@NLO generator is in agreement with the data for the 25 GeV jet \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) threshold, for events with jet multiplicities in the range 3-5. For higher jet \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) thresholds, there is agreement for events with three or four jets (40 and 60 GeV jet \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) threshold) and with events with three jets (80 GeV jet \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) threshold). However, MC@NLO underestimates the data for events with more than six jets and a jet \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) threshold of 25 GeV, and for events with lower jet multiplicities as the jet \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) threshold is increased. This indicates that the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) spectrum predicted by MC@NLO is too soft. For a \(t\overline{t}\) five jet final state, MC@NLO+Herwig is known to underestimate the contribution of the \(t\overline{t}+q(g)\) hard process (producing too much of the additional jet production from parton showering rather than from the tree-level matrix element) [13]. The underestimate of the higher jet multiplicity bins for MC@NLO compared to Alpgen is also observed in Ref. [13]. The prediction from Powheg+Pythia is in reasonable agreement with the data for all jet \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) thresholds and jet multiplicities.

With the exception of events with three or four jets (25 GeV jet \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) threshold) and three jets (40 GeV jet \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) threshold), the Alpgen+Pythia \(\alpha_{\mathrm{S}}\)-up variation is found to generate higher jet multiplicities than observed in the data. The nominal Alpgen+Pythia sample also diverges from the data for events with higher jet multiplicities and the jet \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) thresholds of 60 and 80 GeV. The predictions from Alpgen+Herwig and the Alpgen+Pythia \(\alpha_{\mathrm{S}}\)-down variation are consistent with the data for all jet \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) thresholds.

## 5 Jet shapes in \(t\overline{t}\) events

Jet shapes are a good way to study the fragmentation of partons, quarks and gluons, into jets formed by stable final state particles. They characterise the internal jet structure in terms of the radial energy distribution inside the jet cone. Jets are defined by the anti-\(k_{t}\) jet algorithm with a distance parameter \(R=0.4\)[21]. Integrated jet shapes are defined as the fraction of transverse momentum in concentric Figure 4: The measured gap fraction as a function of \(Q_{0}\) (left) and \(Q_{\rm sum}\) (right) in different rapidity ranges. Data (closed circles) as well as predictions from Aløøø+Pythia (P2011) for different choices of the MLM matching parameter \(dR\) are shown. The yellow band represents the total experimental uncertainty on the data (statistical and systematic). The rapidity regions of \(|y|<0.8\) (top), \(0.8\leq|y|<1.5\) (middle) and \(1.5\leq|y|<2.1\) are shown.

cones with radius \(r\) around the jet axis, i.e.

\[\Psi(r)=\frac{p_{T}(0,r)}{p_{T}(0,R)};\ \ r\leq R. \tag{7}\]

In single lepton \(t\bar{t}\) samples, one can distinguish two types of jets: those coming from the top quark decays \(t\to Wb\) (\(b\)-jets) and those coming from the hadronic \(W\) boson decays (light jets).

For the jet selection a truth matching is carried out by selecting the particle level jets which are closest to the corresponding partons, which include the \(b\)-quarks from the top quark decay for \(b\)-jets and \(u,d,c,s\) quarks from the \(W\) boson decay for light jets. If the distance \(\Delta R\) between the jet and the truth parton is smaller than the jet radius the jet is selected. An additional cut is imposed between the selected jets and any other jets in the same event to avoid overlapping jets (\(\Delta R>0.8\)). This is especially important in the case where the \(W\) bosons are highly boosted and there are likely to be other nearby jets, or merged jets. The \(b\)-jets coming from the top quark decays in the dileptonic channel have also been included in the \(b\)-jet sample.

In Fig. 10 the jet shapes predicted by MC@NLO+Herwig and Powheg+Pythia with the Perugia 2011C tune are compared for both light and \(b\)-jets for several jet \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) ranges between \(30<p_{\mathrm{T}}<200\ \mathrm{GeV}\). Jets induced by \(b\)-quarks are wider on average than light jets, due to the presence of massive \(B\) hadrons produced in the fragmentation of \(b\)-quarks.

In Fig. 11 the jet shapes as predicted by AcerMC+Pythia MorePS and LessPS event samples are compared to the Powheg+Pythia event samples with the Perugia 2011C tune for light and \(b\)-jet shapes for several jet \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) in the range \(30<p_{\mathrm{T}}<200\ \mathrm{GeV}\). The effects of the increase and the decrease of the parton shower activity on the jet shapes is clearly visible.

In summary, these studies indicate that, even when the effects of parton shower tuning are included, there are significant differences between light-jet and b-jet widths which should be observable in top data. The jet shapes are demonstrated to be sensitive to variations in the parton shower activity and the MC model selection.

Figure 5: The gap fraction defined in equation 6 as a function of \(Q_{0}\) is shown for the full rapidity range \(|g|<2.1\). All samples apart from MadGraph+Pythia, Z2 sample are generated within the ATLAS framework. The MadGraph+Pythia, Z2 sample is generated within the CMS framework.

Pseudo-top differential distributions

In this Section observables sensitive to radiation modelling that require top and anti-top reconstruction are studied. The observables considered are similar to the ones used in Ref. [13], where detailed comparisons of MC@NLO with Herwig and Alpgen with Herwig are reported. The generator settings as well as the reconstruction of the observables differ between the studies of this Section and the studies presented in Ref. [13]. It is still interesting to compare the results obtained in each of these studies.

A single-lepton selection was used to select events at the particle level. In particular it was required that a single electron or muon, at least 4 jets with \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>25\) GeV and \(|\eta|<2.5\), at least 2 of which should be tagged as \(b\)-jets (matched to \(B\)-hadrons) are present in the final state. The selection efficiencies of these cuts are listed in Table 1 for the selected MC generators used for MC-MC comparisons in the following.

In order to reconstruct the top quark at the particle level the following criteria have been used:

* Jets associated with a \(b\)-quark are defined and the two with the highest \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) are selected;
* the hadronically decaying \(W\) boson is reconstructed using the two jets with the smallest \(\Delta R\);
* the leptonically decaying \(W\) boson is reconstructed using the lepton and the missing \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) evaluated as the total \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) of all neutrinos in the event (the neutrino longitudinal momentum \(p_{z}\) is reconstructed using the \(W\) boson mass constraint);
* the top quark with the hadronically decaying \(W\) boson (hadronic top) is selected as the one with a \(b\)-jet whose mass was closest to the top mass;
* the top quark with the leptonically decaying \(W\) boson (leptonic top) is selected as the one reconstructed with the remaining \(b\)-jet.

In the following the object reconstructed as described above will be called the pseudo-top. The system obtained from the reconstructed top and anti-top quark will be called the pseudo-\(t\bar{t}\) system. The jets other than \(b\)-jets and the jets used for the hadronically decaying \(W\) boson reconstructions will be called extra jets.

In Fig. 12-15 various MC generator predictions of kinematic quantities reconstructed from the hadronic and leptonic top and for the \(t\bar{t}\) system are compared. The MC generators and tunes which will be compared include the following: MC@NLO+Herwig with AUET2 tune, Alpgen+Herwig with AUET2 tune, Powheg+Herwig with AUET2 tune and Powheg+Pythia with AUET2B tune. The exact generator settings are detailed in Section 2. The selection of observables shown in the figures is similar to observables considered in Ref. [13]. The most important differences between the generator settings of the study presented in Ref. [13] and this study include the difference in the number of extra partons in the ME, ME phase space cuts and parameters used for MLM matching. A notable difference between the study presented in Ref. [13] and this study is that in [13] top quarks are set to be stable, while in this study the top quark observables are obtained using pseudo-system reconstruction.

In summary, all of the generators agree within 10-20%, with most differences arising in the tails of the distributions, at large \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) or \(\eta\).

## 7 Conclusions

The observables sensitive to additional parton radiation modelling in top anti-top quark final states have been discussed. The sensitivity of these observables has been established by comparisons of the predictions of various MC event generators based on different models and using systematically varied model parameters. For observables where measurements are already available the data have been compared to the MC predictions.

In Ref. [1] a probability that the \(t\bar{t}\) events contain no additional jet with transverse momentum above a threshold (\(Q_{0}\)) is measured in four different central rapidity intervals. A measurement in which events are vetoed if the scalar transverse momentum sum of the additional jets (\(Q_{\mathrm{sum}}\)) in each rapidity interval is above a threshold is also performed. The MC event generators considered in this document are in agreement with the data for all but the most forward measured rapidity interval. This measurement is used to identify systematic parameter variations that bracket the data. These are based on AcERMC or Alpgen and used in radiation systematics samples used for assessing generator uncertainties in ATLAS top analyses.

In Ref. [2] the multiplicity of jets for various \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) thresholds is measured in the single lepton \(t\bar{t}\) decay channel in the rapidity region \(|y|<2.5\). The high jet multiplicities are not well described by the MC@NLO generator when used with Herwig and the AUET2 ATLAS tune. All other MC generator predictions studied in this note are compatible with the data.

The jet shapes that characterize the internal jet structure of both light jets and b-jets, as well as various kinematic observables that require reconstruction of the \(t\bar{t}\) system are demonstrated to be sensitive to variations in the parton shower activity and the MC model selection.
